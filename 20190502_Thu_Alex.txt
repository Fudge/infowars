[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is May 2, 2019 on this Thursday, global transmission, I am
[00:29.000 --> 00:34.400]  your host, Alex Jones. I'll be here in the next four hours. Leigh-Anne McAdoo is going
[00:34.400 --> 00:38.560]  to return. She'll be in studio with us in the third and part of the fourth hour. I intend
[00:38.560 --> 00:48.520]  to open the phones up as well today. Hillary Clinton went on Madcow's show last night and
[00:48.520 --> 00:54.600]  with the plunging ratings down to almost no viewers. And we're going to play the clips.
[00:54.600 --> 00:58.400]  Said that she's living rent-free in the president's head and that the Russians are going to try
[00:58.400 --> 01:04.160]  to steal 2020 again, relaunching that whole hoax. When if anybody's in bed with the Russians,
[01:04.160 --> 01:09.720]  it's you, lady, and you know that. But then she had a Freudian moment of truth, Freudian
[01:09.720 --> 01:15.320]  slip of the tongue, as they say, and said, we need the Communist Chinese to come in and
[01:15.320 --> 01:20.440]  overthrow Trump. You understand of the big six production companies, the Chai-Com's own
[01:20.440 --> 01:27.040]  controlling interest, and our funding, total weaponization, teaching people how to self-harm,
[01:27.040 --> 01:31.320]  teaching little girls how to commit suicide, breaking up the family. All this stuff's illegal
[01:31.320 --> 01:36.240]  in China. They don't let their own production company material air there. They say it demoralizes
[01:36.240 --> 01:40.880]  and is designed to bring down the country. But they hit us with the most scientifically
[01:40.880 --> 01:46.120]  designed demoralization. And even though Hillary lost, they're still following through with
[01:46.120 --> 01:50.800]  their operation. It's come out that all the big universities are basically Chai-Com controlled
[01:50.800 --> 01:55.640]  now, the public universities. That's mainstream news now, Washington Post. It's coming out
[01:55.640 --> 02:00.720]  everywhere. And when it all comes out, it's over for all you collaborators. So she's trying
[02:00.720 --> 02:05.480]  to mainline it now and like make a joke. Oh, he said, I don't care who's got the WikiLeaks.
[02:05.480 --> 02:09.120]  Have you got Hillary's emails? Who are the Russians? Release them. That's tongue in
[02:09.120 --> 02:14.120]  cheek. She has a history of being in bed with the Chai-Com's. The Chai-Com's have a thousand
[02:14.120 --> 02:19.440]  times the influence the Russians do in this country. It's a fact. And China is the big
[02:19.440 --> 02:23.160]  military threat. And China is out of control. And China's been given all our deep water
[02:23.160 --> 02:27.320]  ports. And China is heavily involved in her foundation. But see, how do you, if you're
[02:27.320 --> 02:33.400]  a foreign globalist, you're an enemy of the country, how do you defeat the population
[02:33.400 --> 02:37.480]  you're enslaving? You demoralize them. But then in the final phase, you tell them, oh,
[02:37.480 --> 02:42.160]  this other big power, it's only coming in because, you know, there's this other power
[02:42.160 --> 02:48.760]  that Trump's allied with. That's how you sell people on the screw job. And her and Joe Biden
[02:48.760 --> 02:53.840]  and their criminal families have gotten billions of smackaroonies from the Chai-Com. Remember
[02:53.840 --> 02:59.720]  the famous footage on C-SPAN? It's like 20 years ago, the Chinese generals with big briefcases
[02:59.720 --> 03:04.880]  of cash to get the missile secrets. It's like, here's $13 million. And he's like, here's
[03:04.880 --> 03:09.880]  missile secret. I mean, it's like putting money in a vending machine. Put a dollar bill in
[03:09.880 --> 03:16.200]  and get a candy bar out. Put a $30, $40 million in and get the Merv technology for the ICBMs.
[03:16.200 --> 03:21.400]  20-something years ago, the Chai-Coms couldn't get an ICBM off the ground. They all blew
[03:21.400 --> 03:27.400]  up like cheap Chinese fireworks. Well, now, ladies and gentlemen, they can hit any city
[03:27.400 --> 03:33.920]  they want, thanks to the traders known as the Clintons. Here is a clip of the pumpkin-headed
[03:33.920 --> 03:39.800]  witch last night. I thought she was casting for the remake of, of course, her favorite
[03:39.800 --> 03:44.440]  movie, The Exorcist. Seriously, she looks like a demon-possessed jack-o'-lantern because
[03:44.440 --> 03:46.720]  she is. Here it is.
[03:46.720 --> 03:54.200]  Imagine, Rachel, that you had one of the Democratic nominees for 2020 on your show. And that
[03:54.200 --> 04:00.120]  person said, you know, the only other adversary of ours who's anywhere near as good as the
[04:00.120 --> 04:09.440]  Russians is China. So why should Russia have all the fun? And since Russia is clearly backing
[04:09.440 --> 04:16.600]  Republicans, why don't we ask China to back us? I hear by tonight. Ask China. That's right.
[04:16.600 --> 04:22.240]  And not only that, China, if you're listening, why don't you get Trump's tax returns? I'm
[04:22.240 --> 04:30.080]  sure our media would richly reward you. Now, according to the Mueller report, that is not
[04:30.080 --> 04:37.280]  conspiracy because it's done right out in the open. So if after this hypothetical Democratic
[04:37.280 --> 04:44.440]  candidate says this on your show, within hours, all of a sudden, the IRS offices are bombarded
[04:44.440 --> 04:49.200]  with incredibly sophisticated scientific tools. I want to come back with this demon's last
[04:49.200 --> 04:56.600]  political gas. Stay with us. I'm Alex Jones with newswars.com and infowars.com. Spreading
[04:56.600 --> 05:02.080]  those links is an act of rebellion deterring. You know, the worst part about getting old
[05:02.080 --> 05:06.160]  and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday. That's why
[05:06.160 --> 05:10.280]  I had to make them strong now. Now I can be there for my children. Now I can make them
[05:10.280 --> 05:15.000]  strong. Now I can instruct them. Now I can teach them what I've learned, but not once
[05:15.000 --> 05:17.920]  I'm gone. You think of this digital age, your words gone forever, but now they're
[05:17.920 --> 05:22.160]  even better, getting rid of what you said they were before. It's so much easier to burn
[05:22.160 --> 05:27.320]  video or text or languages now that we have high tech book burning, isn't it? But I have
[05:27.320 --> 05:32.560]  joined my will to the resistance. I can't be destroyed now. As long as I realize I've
[05:32.560 --> 05:36.320]  done right and the long as the people know the truth and you can't be destroyed either,
[05:36.320 --> 05:41.680]  as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for
[05:41.680 --> 05:46.520]  it, there is a magic that then takes place, the transcend space and time when you commit
[05:46.520 --> 05:51.200]  the word of mouth or to pray for us or to spread our articles and videos that overrides
[05:51.200 --> 05:56.320]  everything the enemy's doing. So please now commit to support info wars however you can
[05:56.320 --> 06:03.320]  and realize your provision to info wars is your own provision.
[06:26.320 --> 06:33.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, Venezuela is already collapsed. The question is how bad is it
[06:39.040 --> 06:42.600]  going to get and who's going to take control of it? Trump's now signaling that they're
[06:42.600 --> 06:47.200]  reportedly going to quote do something next week. Is that just propaganda purposes so
[06:47.200 --> 06:51.920]  that Maduro goes ahead and flees? Who knows? We're going to be watching all that very,
[06:51.920 --> 06:58.920]  very closely. U.S. military is prepping for the takeover in Venezuela of who they recognize
[06:58.920 --> 07:05.160]  as the president. We have just got so much amazing news on that front. Phoenix's St.
[07:05.160 --> 07:09.920]  Joseph Catholic Church has been destroyed by fire. Who knows if that's arson? We know
[07:09.920 --> 07:14.920]  a lot of these are arson. We're also going to obviously look at the big deep state war
[07:14.920 --> 07:21.040]  going on that's front and center with Barr now having Pelosi say he's a criminal, that
[07:21.040 --> 07:25.920]  he lied to Congress with no evidence when they had this parade of liars up there lying
[07:25.920 --> 07:32.920]  to Congress. So that war is kicking into very high gear after the contentious activity
[07:32.920 --> 07:37.000]  that happened in the Senate yesterday. He did not show up because he couldn't agree to
[07:37.000 --> 07:43.080]  the ground rules with the chairman of the committee, Nadler a.k.a. the penguin. So we're
[07:43.080 --> 07:46.640]  going to get to some of the highlights from yesterday, some of the bizarre highlights
[07:46.640 --> 07:51.560]  today with congressmen with buckets of chicken and toy chickens they're throwing around and
[07:51.560 --> 07:56.840]  acting bizarre as their mental illness just intensifies. And of course one of the big
[07:56.840 --> 08:07.280]  issues is Hillary Clinton, ladies and gentlemen, going on Rachel Maddow's show with its dismal
[08:07.280 --> 08:13.960]  plunging ratings after their whole Russia hoax fell flat and saying that we need the
[08:13.960 --> 08:22.240]  Chinese, we need the Chinese Communist to come to the aid in 2020 and overthrow the
[08:22.240 --> 08:27.720]  election and remove Trump. Now, here's what's incredible. This is the only place, unless
[08:27.720 --> 08:31.280]  you're actually reading intelligence reports put out by patriots at the Pentagon and some
[08:31.280 --> 08:39.760]  of the patriots in intelligence agencies, that China is more politically engaged in
[08:39.760 --> 08:49.680]  this country than the Democrats, than the Republicans, than the NRA. China has over 10,000 front
[08:49.680 --> 08:55.600]  companies. China owns a majority stock in all of the major production houses, all six, tried
[08:55.600 --> 09:00.480]  to buy up the two smaller ones last year. Trump put the kibosh on that. They own the
[09:00.480 --> 09:05.120]  majority of our debt. They steal all our technology. They've got all the major U.S. companies,
[09:05.120 --> 09:10.600]  big tech, officially moving there, Apple, Google, you name it, to then be tax exempt
[09:10.600 --> 09:16.640]  and state run. And I was in D.C. talking to like Eric Boling people. He couldn't believe
[09:16.640 --> 09:20.360]  it. And then when his staff pulled it up, he was blown away. But when I was meeting
[09:20.360 --> 09:26.960]  with people in U.S. intelligence, they all are on the exact same page. Everybody knows
[09:26.960 --> 09:32.640]  what's going on. This is hiding in plain view, okay? This is all right out in the open. America
[09:32.640 --> 09:36.880]  was basically done. We've been totally sold out. We were being prepared to be collapsed
[09:36.880 --> 09:44.440]  economically and be a vassal state managed by the Democrats, the EU and the Chai Cops.
[09:44.440 --> 09:48.760]  And Trump came in, turned the whole thing around, made Saudi Arabia stand down, wiped
[09:48.760 --> 09:52.440]  out ISIS with the Russians, was trying to stabilize the economy. The Federal Reserve
[09:52.440 --> 09:56.360]  came in, the private Federal Reserve, they tried to kill the economy. They almost did,
[09:56.360 --> 10:02.600]  but Trump got it reversed. We are in an absolute deathmatch with the globalist, okay? This
[10:02.600 --> 10:06.440]  isn't like you get in a boxing ring and they put gloves on you. This is you get in a boxing
[10:06.440 --> 10:10.720]  ring and they hand you, like out of escape from New York, baseball bats with nails in
[10:10.720 --> 10:18.520]  them and trash can lits. You have to understand, the globalist made their move with Hillary.
[10:18.520 --> 10:22.200]  They're making their move all over the world and people, humanity is desperately fighting
[10:22.200 --> 10:28.360]  back. And Trump is just the deucex, perfect manifestation of how God works in mysterious
[10:28.360 --> 10:33.360]  ways that you'd have somebody with that charisma, that stamina, that will. He's not perfect,
[10:33.360 --> 10:38.920]  none of us are, but God's plan is perfect. And they are so pissed because no weapon formed
[10:38.920 --> 10:45.800]  against us is prospering right now. That said, the Pentagon and the military are on alert.
[10:45.800 --> 10:50.320]  As you know, a bunch of generals and admirals and others have been removed or have had their
[10:50.320 --> 10:54.840]  chain of command cut. They've been basically back benched. And it's not just the head of
[10:54.840 --> 10:59.720]  Guantanamo Bay. It's not just the head of the Air Force Academy. It's hundreds of people
[10:59.720 --> 11:03.280]  are quietly being relieved of command right now, or being basically sent to the North
[11:03.280 --> 11:11.400]  Pole, as they'd say. And that's being done ahead of what we know. In S 13, the Democrats,
[11:11.400 --> 11:17.280]  Antifa are linked up with terrorist organizations, criminal organizations. Hezbollah is working
[11:17.280 --> 11:21.640]  with the Democrats. As you know, the Democrats may deal with Iran. I mean, they've got some
[11:21.640 --> 11:27.760]  real terror networks in this country that are really seriously prepared and ready to
[11:27.760 --> 11:34.000]  carry out massive terror attacks that will be blamed on me. You just, you can count your
[11:34.000 --> 11:38.840]  bottom dollars on that. They'll be blamed on you. They'll be blamed on Trump, but we will
[11:38.840 --> 11:43.760]  be front and center. So make no mistake about it, ladies and gentlemen. You don't just think
[11:43.760 --> 11:48.160]  I pulled all that out of a hat last year when I told you Antifa was working with MS 13 and
[11:48.160 --> 11:55.080]  others and preparing terror attacks. They'll just be the decoys. Okay. So targeted assassinations,
[11:55.080 --> 12:01.000]  all of it. They're really planning this. You don't just think the Clintons and all these
[12:01.000 --> 12:07.120]  people were just going to push, push, push it and back off. They're not going to stop.
[12:07.120 --> 12:13.640]  And if you underestimate how savagely criminal they are, then you will be defeated. We will
[12:13.640 --> 12:16.920]  be defeated if we just wake up to the fact that they're pure evil. And I want to explain
[12:16.920 --> 12:21.200]  something here. I mentioned it yesterday, but I'm going to do it more today. Even seeing
[12:21.200 --> 12:28.520]  it admits teen suicides of the exact demographic of low teen girls and preteen girls skyrocketed
[12:28.520 --> 12:33.760]  directly after they watched the show, glorifying little girls committing suicide or making
[12:33.760 --> 12:42.040]  it, you know, a romantic thing. This is a microcosm. I sent people, I'm just going to
[12:42.040 --> 12:47.080]  leave it at this, two major film festivals, because I already knew this was going on,
[12:47.080 --> 12:51.000]  but they were in the meetings with these individuals this year at Sundance, you name it, where
[12:51.000 --> 12:57.760]  they said, we get money to demoralize. We get money to make the most depressing, horrible,
[12:57.760 --> 13:02.760]  anti-American stuff we can. And that is our job. And they're openly all competing with
[13:02.760 --> 13:06.440]  each other about who can be the most horrible and be the most evil. And they know their
[13:06.440 --> 13:12.320]  mission. So I'm going to explain to you very, very clearly. They're saying they want to
[13:12.320 --> 13:15.120]  kill babies after they're born and they're doing it. They're saying the world's going
[13:15.120 --> 13:18.840]  to end in 12 years. They're shipping in millions of people, hundreds of thousands of which
[13:18.840 --> 13:24.800]  have serious diseases. And then if you link to medical reports put out by the CDC and
[13:24.800 --> 13:29.840]  even the Border Patrol, they put up notes saying it's fake news and block it on Facebook.
[13:29.840 --> 13:35.560]  That happened to us yesterday. I'll be showing you that. I was just linking to ABC News and
[13:35.560 --> 13:41.920]  medical reports saying that it's not unvaccinated. That's a hoax. It's the illegals. So you have
[13:41.920 --> 13:46.520]  to understand, folks, they are demoralizing. They are trying to depress you and destroy
[13:46.520 --> 13:51.040]  you. Hillary was meant to be put in to cause a war between men and women. That was her
[13:51.040 --> 13:55.680]  whole admitted plan. She was meant to be ugly and a liar and demoralizing and to make our
[13:55.680 --> 14:02.520]  military give up and to make us feel failed. They do it all on purpose. They do it as an
[14:02.520 --> 14:10.680]  exercise of evil, just like Brian Williams got up there until he was shot down in a helicopter.
[14:10.680 --> 14:13.880]  They're on the ground with people trying to kill him and he was, you know, basically
[14:13.880 --> 14:19.960]  super soldier. It was all lie. He runs the fact checking for MSNBC now and puts on total
[14:19.960 --> 14:26.400]  hoaxes, total lies, CNN, but you know, hundreds of bottles of gum, gum drops or gum balls
[14:26.400 --> 14:29.840]  and says, oh, every one of these is a lie. It's how you talk to a three year old. They're
[14:29.840 --> 14:35.400]  the liars. They're the frauds. They're the enemy and they're planning big stuff. So you
[14:35.400 --> 14:38.600]  just think about how dumb they think you are that they've got Hillary who pulled the Brian
[14:38.600 --> 14:43.600]  Williams in Serbia in Bosnia. You've got Brian Williams up there. This is how stupid
[14:43.600 --> 14:49.240]  they think you are. Demoralizing you, feeding you a steady total diet of disinformation
[14:49.240 --> 14:54.800]  to literally break your will. But instead we've got Trump and that's why they've harassed
[14:54.800 --> 14:59.240]  and targeted and sued and threatened anyone that supported Trump and anyone that supported
[14:59.240 --> 15:03.360]  American relaunch thinking we'd all give up or they thought they'd come and offer everybody
[15:03.360 --> 15:08.080]  in his entourage or a support group money, supposedly from the Russians so they could
[15:08.080 --> 15:13.400]  make their made up canard real. No one would take the money from the FBI and from their
[15:13.400 --> 15:19.560]  people. Ladies and gentlemen, we are winning, but let me explain this to everybody. And
[15:19.560 --> 15:24.720]  I know you know this. It's critical that my mission continue on against the enemy and
[15:24.720 --> 15:29.160]  this mission that you're a part of. And it's critical that Trump continue on because just
[15:29.160 --> 15:32.480]  because we're turning the tide, this is a battle. We haven't won the war yet. We need
[15:32.480 --> 15:36.600]  your prayers. We need your word of mouth, spreading the word about what we do here and
[15:36.600 --> 15:42.760]  we need your financial support at infowarstore.com. And there's thousands of great items, the best
[15:42.760 --> 15:45.880]  products that are out there need to get in there and take advantage of that. And I know
[15:45.880 --> 15:50.120]  you've been doing it, but just know this. This is a battle of wills and we need to be
[15:50.120 --> 15:55.040]  provisioned to this war and we need money. So go to infowarstore.com and get great products
[15:55.040 --> 16:01.560]  at the same time, a total 360 win. Okay, so a watch is good and some jewelry, better

[17:28.560 --> 17:33.960]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[17:33.960 --> 17:39.040]  the world. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of
[17:39.040 --> 17:45.880]  Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken. Its former colony, the U.S.,
[17:45.880 --> 17:51.440]  had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began
[17:51.440 --> 18:00.280]  with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunne, available at Amazon Books.
[18:00.280 --> 18:05.560]  Info Wars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine. Introducing Pollen Block.
[18:05.560 --> 18:11.040]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[18:11.040 --> 18:17.640]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[18:17.640 --> 18:23.480]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.480 --> 18:28.880]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published
[18:28.880 --> 18:34.280]  trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable
[18:34.280 --> 18:40.480]  tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[18:40.480 --> 18:45.080]  It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by
[18:45.080 --> 18:50.320]  blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory
[18:50.320 --> 18:56.680]  responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to InfoWarsLife.com
[18:56.680 --> 19:00.200]  and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.

[20:04.040 --> 20:11.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:11.600 --> 20:16.880]  President Trump gives every indication by what he says and what he does and what he doesn't
[20:16.880 --> 20:28.920]  do, that he's mean as a Wolverine.
[20:28.920 --> 20:33.040]  It's 11.59 at Radio Free America, and this is Uncle Sam with Music and the Truth Until
[20:33.040 --> 20:37.280]  Dawn. Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied
[20:37.280 --> 20:44.320]  zone. The chair is against the wall. The chair is against the wall. John has a long mustache.
[20:44.320 --> 20:50.880]  It's 12 o'clock American, another day closer to victory. And for all of you out there on
[20:50.880 --> 20:55.400]  or behind the lines, this is your song.
[20:55.400 --> 21:02.640]  But they took a lot of people away. People that they thought were going to make trouble
[21:02.640 --> 21:06.680]  for them. People that had guns or things they wanted. They just took them away.
[21:06.680 --> 21:07.680]  Where?
[21:07.680 --> 21:09.680]  Re-education camps. That's what they call it.
[21:09.680 --> 21:13.560]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong
[21:13.560 --> 21:17.920]  to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[21:17.920 --> 21:27.960]  I have decided we really need camps for adults. And we need the kind of camps that you all
[21:27.960 --> 21:29.480]  run. I mean, really.
[21:29.480 --> 21:34.240]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register. Now they were taken to racetracks
[21:34.240 --> 21:37.920]  and fairgrounds where the Army almost overnight had built assembly centers.
[21:37.920 --> 21:43.920]  I'm a sorry citizen. I refuse to recognize you guys.
[21:43.920 --> 21:44.920]  What kind of a situation in the U.S. would you see that happening?
[21:44.920 --> 21:48.920]  I mean, we've got a lot of Constitution lists and a lot of people that start power weapons.
[21:48.920 --> 21:52.640]  Plus, you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability
[21:52.640 --> 21:59.440]  and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[21:59.440 --> 22:04.200]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal
[22:04.200 --> 22:09.200]  to the United States. It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal
[22:09.200 --> 22:10.200]  community.
[22:10.200 --> 22:20.200]  It's what we're doing here. And let's not kid about it. We're building a domestic
[22:20.200 --> 22:24.200]  army because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[22:24.200 --> 22:27.200]  Put your gun down, really?
[22:27.200 --> 22:34.200]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[22:34.200 --> 22:37.200]  Are you some kind of a Constitutionist?
[22:37.200 --> 22:45.200]  So these people, they hold themselves out to be patriots or not. They're nothing more
[22:45.200 --> 22:47.200]  than domestic terrorists.
[22:47.200 --> 23:05.200]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[23:05.200 --> 23:25.200]  President Trump gives every indication by what he says and what he does and what he doesn't
[23:25.200 --> 23:34.200]  do that he's mean as a Wolverine.
[23:34.200 --> 23:44.200]  Here's to the Sentinels.
[23:44.200 --> 23:52.200]  All right, let's get right into it here. I'm going to do my best in the next segment that's
[23:52.200 --> 23:58.200]  longer to lay out Hillary Clinton's public treason with China and understand that stay
[23:58.200 --> 24:02.200]  behind networks, criminal groups in our government, we're selling us out to China. The CFR said
[24:02.200 --> 24:09.200]  America was over. We saw Lloyd Blank find before he left Goldman Sachs laughing at Trump last
[24:09.200 --> 24:14.200]  year saying you'll never rebuild America. America sucks. Look it up. He put tweets out.
[24:14.200 --> 24:20.200]  So this is the attitude. The globalists have conquered us. They've beaten us. They believe.
[24:20.200 --> 24:28.200]  And, you know, to them, these are chicken-neck, needle, you know what it, nobodies who criminally
[24:28.200 --> 24:33.200]  got their power. And so to them, still they know that America is superior to them. They
[24:33.200 --> 24:37.200]  know that Americans aren't traitors, that Americans love unborn children, that Americans are good
[24:37.200 --> 24:44.200]  honorable people. They're threatened by our strength, by our history. And so to Neil Dex,
[24:44.200 --> 24:49.200]  excuse me, I said it, to these types of individuals, everything is dominating America.
[24:49.200 --> 24:54.200]  Everything is ruining it and screwing it over and demoralizing it. That's the power.
[24:54.200 --> 24:59.200]  That's the spirit of Satan that you see destroy countries over and over again that the Bible
[24:59.200 --> 25:04.200]  talks about. It's real. And now you look at the Democrats. The world's gonna end. Let's
[25:04.200 --> 25:10.200]  kill babies after they're born. Kill grandma. Bring out all the diseases. Teach little girls
[25:10.200 --> 25:15.200]  how to commit suicide in all the schools and watch the level of suicide explode. Put 20
[25:15.200 --> 25:22.200]  percent of the kids on serotonin re-uptake inhibitors that massively increase suicide.
[25:22.200 --> 25:27.200]  Democrats are all over TV saying, let's kill babies, kill them now or kill them later. That
[25:27.200 --> 25:33.200]  clip's coming up. It's up on infowars.com. Evil is coming out of the woodwork. It's standing
[25:33.200 --> 25:39.200]  up on tiny legs. It's showing you its teeth. It's going about roaring like a lion, seeing
[25:39.200 --> 25:46.200]  who they may devour. Kill, steal and destroy. And now they don't know what to do because
[25:46.200 --> 25:53.200]  humanity is waking up to them. Humanity is saying no to them. And so they're telling us
[25:53.200 --> 25:57.200]  the Russians are coming, but really it's the globalist and the EU and the Chai comms in
[25:57.200 --> 26:02.200]  Hollywood. And they were in control of radical Islam through Saudi Arabia. Now that deal's
[26:02.200 --> 26:07.200]  been turned around. All the Democrats have is Hezbollah, MS-13, their stay behind networks,
[26:07.200 --> 26:13.200]  the Antifa methods, the whole Hollywood hate America combine, the Chai comms economically,
[26:13.200 --> 26:19.200]  the EU, but all those people are easy to defeat. Their regimes are teetering because they're
[26:19.200 --> 26:26.200]  authoritarian. We're on the march, the empire's on the run. Now it doesn't make it fun for
[26:26.200 --> 26:30.200]  those of us out there like you that speak out and tell the truth in the face of this
[26:30.200 --> 26:35.200]  because you get attacked, but that's the cost of liberty. And we're paying a lot lower cost
[26:35.200 --> 26:41.200]  than what our forebears had to pay. And believe me, they're proud of what you're all doing
[26:41.200 --> 26:45.200]  out there today, but this is an incredible time to be alive. And now they've taken the
[26:45.200 --> 26:52.200]  gloves off with AG Barb, who by the way, gave them a chance to stand down. I know for a
[26:52.200 --> 26:56.200]  fact Trump three separate times has met with Pelosi and Schumer and others and said, if
[26:56.200 --> 27:01.200]  you just won't raise interest rates, it won't sabotage the economy. And let me defend the
[27:01.200 --> 27:09.200]  border. We can share power and let them and they're like, no, no, no, no. And now Trump's
[27:09.200 --> 27:12.200]  giving them three chances. He's talked about it publicly. Hell, I've had a conversation
[27:12.200 --> 27:17.200]  with him about it a couple of times. You heard him on Hannity last week. He said, well,
[27:17.200 --> 27:20.200]  I called him and wanted to give him a chance to fix it and just move forward when I won
[27:20.200 --> 27:24.200]  two and a half years ago, but they just, they just, they just, they just, they just want
[27:24.200 --> 27:30.200]  to destroy me in the country. So well, now Trump gets it. And so Trump understands, but
[27:30.200 --> 27:34.200]  he gave the third chance with Barr brought into mind that's been part of the both power
[27:34.200 --> 27:40.200]  structures. Republican Democrat brought into cleanup earlier message and scandals, but
[27:40.200 --> 27:44.200]  obviously a very smart capable person. You can watch that testimony. The guy who watched
[27:44.200 --> 27:47.200]  Ted Cruz and them, it says, these guys are so smart and so slick. It makes your head
[27:47.200 --> 27:53.200]  spin, doesn't it? But the point is, is that compared to the Democrat mental midgets in
[27:53.200 --> 27:58.200]  there, they can hardly talk, but they can sure throw words out like, you love Hitler,
[27:58.200 --> 28:05.200]  you're a liar, you're going to jail. They're too dumb to know when to quit folks. They
[28:05.200 --> 28:09.200]  really think they're going to win. They really think they're going to get away with all of
[28:09.200 --> 28:13.200]  this. And again, the Democrats, they could be black, they could be white, they could
[28:13.200 --> 28:20.200]  be male, female. They all have inferiority complexes. The cities they run are literal
[28:20.200 --> 28:26.200]  hell holes. They're babies. They have no chivalry, no honor, no intelligence, no learning,
[28:26.200 --> 28:33.200]  no capacity to know when to stop. And so we're going to get into all of when we come back
[28:33.200 --> 28:38.200]  and so much more, but this is an incredible time to be alive and Trump is going after
[28:38.200 --> 28:42.200]  them and they're going after him and they're coming after us. So just know you're in a
[28:42.200 --> 28:46.200]  fight for the Republic. You're living in history right now. We just caught up in an
[28:46.200 --> 28:53.200]  attempted coup and they're not backing down. It's on, baby. It's on. Yeah. This is it.
[28:53.200 --> 28:59.200]  I'm going to tell with the globalist scum. Yeah. Yeah. This is it right now.
[28:59.200 --> 29:04.200]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me. You don't know

[29:09.200 --> 29:15.200]  little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life. I realized I needed
[29:15.200 --> 29:20.200]  help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me. If you've tried to fix your
[29:20.200 --> 29:25.200]  drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the

[35:23.200 --> 35:29.200]  Okay, so let's get into it here.
[35:29.200 --> 35:34.200]  I remember being awake 25, 26 years ago.
[35:34.200 --> 35:39.200]  But then as soon as I got on air 25 years ago, people started sending me stuff.
[35:39.200 --> 35:44.200]  I started going to the coffee meetings and going here in events and going and hearing speakers.
[35:44.200 --> 35:52.200]  And it was like retired FBI agents and retired Brigadier Generals and Major Generals and all these people warning and saying all this wild stuff
[35:52.200 --> 35:58.200]  and a plan to demoralize people and break down the family and megabanks funding communism in the Chinese century
[35:58.200 --> 36:01.200]  and how they were going to sabotage America so that we couldn't operate.
[36:01.200 --> 36:11.200]  Now that we get in the Panama Canal and on and on and on and then sort of reading the actual books that the Council on Foreign Relations has written.
[36:11.200 --> 36:20.200]  They put out a bi-monthly publication and I was seeing all this and they were openly saying everything I was hearing out of these people's mouths.
[36:20.200 --> 36:25.200]  Because I was a libertarian conservative pro-gun guy and knew about the New World Order and all that.
[36:25.200 --> 36:31.200]  But I didn't know that Strom Talbot was saying America sucks. We're getting rid of it.
[36:31.200 --> 36:38.200]  Communism is the way to go and China will dominate the U.S. and we'll put Chinese troops in the U.S. if need be in the future.
[36:38.200 --> 36:45.200]  And the way we'll do it is we'll say there's an outside threat and that our governments run by traders working with say something like Russia.
[36:45.200 --> 36:52.200]  And then we'll be able to bring Chinese troops in and you're reading this and then you find out the weathermen were teaching this on colleges.
[36:52.200 --> 37:01.200]  And then you learn there were trials and people got convicted and you're like, wow, you know, I always thought of America as invincible and strong.
[37:01.200 --> 37:03.200]  And something like this could never happen.
[37:03.200 --> 37:11.200]  But then I sit back and I look at Hillary and what they're pushing and what they do and how they transferred almost all our jobs to China.
[37:11.200 --> 37:14.200]  And how they set up tariffs in China so we couldn't operate.
[37:14.200 --> 37:18.200]  And how they deindustrialized this and now how they're demoralizing it.
[37:18.200 --> 37:25.200]  And I remember being out in Hollywood and some movies and TV shows and things back when I even cared to be in them, like 15, 16, 17 years ago.
[37:25.200 --> 37:28.200]  And they'd say, you know, who's buying up all the movie studios?
[37:28.200 --> 37:32.200]  It's the Chinese government and they tell us what we can say what we can't do.
[37:32.200 --> 37:35.200]  Well, now that's all mainstream news the last five years.
[37:35.200 --> 37:42.200]  So the communist Chinese or state run folks and they can print unlimited money and they can buy up anything they want.
[37:42.200 --> 37:48.200]  And under Clinton and Bush and Obama and that's a long time.
[37:48.200 --> 37:52.200]  That's three eight year presidencies.
[37:52.200 --> 37:55.200]  So that's a long, long time, 20 plus years.
[37:55.200 --> 38:01.200]  There has been a complete sellout down to just fumes in the tank.
[38:01.200 --> 38:06.200]  And so Trump jokingly when they were calling him a Russian agent during the campaign, he said, I don't care who's got the WikiLeaks.
[38:06.200 --> 38:07.200]  I don't care who's got the emails.
[38:07.200 --> 38:12.200]  Whoever it is could be a 400 pound guy in his bedroom. It could be somebody in Russia. Who knows.
[38:12.200 --> 38:14.200]  But okay, fine, Russia. You got him. Release him.
[38:14.200 --> 38:17.200]  It's not about who's got him. It's about Hillary's crimes.
[38:17.200 --> 38:20.200]  Trump has no history of being in bed with the Russians or the Chai comms.
[38:20.200 --> 38:24.200]  He has no history of espionage like Hillary or a foundation with $4 million in it.
[38:24.200 --> 38:29.200]  He didn't have Chinese generals in the White House with suitcases of $30 million on C-span.
[38:29.200 --> 38:31.200]  That's how arrogant Bill Clinton is.
[38:31.200 --> 38:33.200]  So video.
[38:33.200 --> 38:40.200]  You're the globalist that took the Iranian one money. You're the ones that destroyed your servers with hammers and all this crap.
[38:40.200 --> 38:45.200]  Talk about open and shut cases. You're the ones caught red-handed lying to Congress.
[38:45.200 --> 38:49.200]  This has got a bunch of liars like Brian Williams as your fat checker.
[38:49.200 --> 38:51.200]  I heard they're going to make Brian Williams the head of Snopes.
[38:51.200 --> 38:53.200]  He's in talks to head up Sirius.
[38:53.200 --> 38:57.200]  To head up Snopes. That's perfect.
[38:57.200 --> 39:00.200]  Maybe you can get Pinocchio to do it.
[39:00.200 --> 39:05.200]  But that's who these people are. It's all about their con game.
[39:05.200 --> 39:09.200]  Their arrogance. Can they con you one more time?
[39:09.200 --> 39:13.200]  The world ends in 12 years unless you give AOC all your money.
[39:13.200 --> 39:17.200]  Or Beto all your money. It's the same crap. These people are jokes.
[39:17.200 --> 39:22.200]  Mental patients. Narcissists. Sociopaths.
[39:22.200 --> 39:25.200]  And then Hillary goes on.
[39:25.200 --> 39:30.200]  Rick. What's his name?
[39:30.200 --> 39:34.200]  Rick Maddow. I mean, Rachel Maddow's show. Sorry, I forget the names sometimes.
[39:34.200 --> 39:38.200]  Rachel Maddow's show. And goes on there.
[39:38.200 --> 39:40.200]  And we'll see.
[39:40.200 --> 39:43.200]  It's tongue in cheek. Oh, Chinese government help us. Help us beat Trump.
[39:43.200 --> 39:46.200]  No, that's who you've had helping you. Demoralizing us.
[39:46.200 --> 39:49.200]  Paying for all these shows and movies on Netflix.
[39:49.200 --> 39:55.200]  To demoralize. Mint to make our kids beyond drugs and commit suicide. They admit it. China bans all these shows.
[39:55.200 --> 39:59.200]  Saying it would demoralize and overthrow their country. And then they fund it here.
[39:59.200 --> 40:04.200]  Hollywood's like a giant cobra full of venom to attach to your children.
[40:04.200 --> 40:09.200]  So here's the witch in everybody's face who has a real relationship with the Chi Coms.
[40:09.200 --> 40:14.200]  And the whole CFR system to sell the country out. And she's saying, come help us defeat America.
[40:14.200 --> 40:19.200]  And remember, the Chinese dictator two years ago went to Davos.
[40:19.200 --> 40:24.200]  And he said, we will defeat Trump with the EU power.
[40:24.200 --> 40:28.200]  And we will defeat it. And oh, China's going to save globalism.
[40:28.200 --> 40:33.200]  They're openly organized against us. And now Hillary wants to trick leftist to go.
[40:33.200 --> 40:39.200]  She knows China. Treason's coming out. Like, yeah, we're in trouble with China. They're the good guys. Yay. Yay.
[40:39.200 --> 40:44.200]  See, that's how you trick Americans to support an outside power. It's about claiming, oh, Trump and the Republicans,
[40:44.200 --> 40:52.200]  they've got the Russians on their team. So we've got the Chi Coms. This is the seduction by this pumpkin-headed demon.
[40:52.200 --> 40:55.200]  All right, go ahead and roll it. Here it is.
[40:55.200 --> 41:02.200]  Imagine, Rachel, that you had one of the Democratic nominees for 2020 on your show.
[41:02.200 --> 41:11.200]  And that person said, you know, the only other adversary of ours who's anywhere near as good as the Russians is China.
[41:11.200 --> 41:23.200]  So why should Russia have all the fun? And since Russia is clearly backing Republicans, why don't we ask China to back us?
[41:23.200 --> 41:25.200]  I hear by tonight. Ask China.
[41:25.200 --> 41:31.200]  That's right. And not only that, China, if you're listening, why don't you get Trump's tax returns?
[41:31.200 --> 41:37.200]  I'm sure our media would richly reward you. Now, according to the Mueller report,
[41:37.200 --> 41:42.200]  Okay, that's enough from her. And then she goes on to say more of it. His tax returns are his private information.
[41:42.200 --> 41:45.200]  You want to harass everybody in business with him. We know what you want to do, terrorist.
[41:45.200 --> 41:51.200]  Your criminal activity with the illegal server running your own private payout system, pay to play at the State Department,
[41:51.200 --> 42:01.200]  through that server as a dropbox you used to sell out the United States is of issue, which you pumpkin headed demon.
[42:01.200 --> 42:08.200]  We're going to come back and get into even more on Venezuela on that. That intervention is coming up how the neocons try to set Trump up.
[42:08.200 --> 42:16.200]  We're going to get into so much more and the big water scandal out in California, how toxic and carcinogen laced the water is.
[42:16.200 --> 42:24.200]  I thought I was a conspiracy theorist warning people about such common sense things as this. That is all coming up today as well.
[42:24.200 --> 42:30.200]  Then Leanne McAdoo is going to be in studio and we're going to open the phones up in the next hour.
[42:30.200 --> 42:38.200]  I'm Alex Jones, your host info wars.com news wars.com and I cannot stress to you enough, ladies and gentlemen.
[42:38.200 --> 42:47.200]  I cannot stress to you enough the importance of realizing that the enemy is working around the clock to keep folks from hearing this broadcast.
[42:47.200 --> 42:55.200]  No matter how you listen, telling people to tune in and telling them the verboten broadcast is there isn't just critical, it is essential to victory.
[42:55.200 --> 43:09.200]  So whatever you do, however you do it, spread the word. I thank you.
[43:25.200 --> 43:30.200]  They don't want us to have that victory. They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[43:30.200 --> 43:35.200]  And that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying to shut in for wars now.
[43:35.200 --> 43:44.200]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty away. This country is in a war.

[47:24.200 --> 47:45.200]  We're back on this Thursday broadcast. I'm Alex Jones, your host. Thank you for joining us.
[47:45.200 --> 47:53.200]  I want to get back into this because I know that people that have been in the military or people that have been in high-level corporate positions
[47:53.200 --> 47:58.200]  or folks that have studied history know what I'm saying is totally true.
[47:58.200 --> 48:06.200]  But if you're a new listener or you just tune into regular politics news, that's all controlled spectrum stuff.
[48:06.200 --> 48:13.200]  Now, more and more, we've broken the paradigm and now have sophisticated discussions going on on Rush Limbaugh on Sean Hannity.
[48:13.200 --> 48:23.200]  The establishment is accurate in that we radicalized them, we brought and showed the success of an audience understanding complex issues,
[48:23.200 --> 48:29.200]  not just spoon-feeding the same repetitive, conservative talking points.
[48:29.200 --> 48:38.200]  Let me tell you, the environmentalists aren't wackos. Their minions are the people running it are billionaires that want to steal your land, your property, and control the markets.
[48:38.200 --> 48:48.200]  And it just goes from there. The Chai Khoms are bloodthirsty tyrants, the biggest murderers, the most soulless, cold-blooded regime the planet has ever seen.
[48:48.200 --> 48:58.200]  And they're allied with David Rockefeller's Combine. He set it up. He made the deal. He did it. They were that close to taking the planet over and just engaging in nightmare activities.
[48:58.200 --> 49:06.200]  And they cheerlead them at Davos. And they cheerlead this everywhere in the CFR publications. You have to listen to me.
[49:06.200 --> 49:14.200]  This is not hyperbole. This is why they want us off the air.
[49:14.200 --> 49:23.200]  Because we made popular what they're actually talking about. They thought it was all academic and stuffy rooms and that you'd never figure it out, but you did.
[49:23.200 --> 49:32.200]  And now law enforcement and the military gets it. And there's no putting the chicken back in the egg now. No putting the junior back in the bottle for their system.
[49:32.200 --> 49:40.200]  And I don't just say that to demoralize the enemy. It's the truth. They need to give up. They need to stop. China needs to reform. Islam needs to reform.
[49:40.200 --> 49:48.200]  Hollywood and the dehumanization it's engaged in. My God, we're killing babies after they're born now. More states have passed laws to do it.
[49:48.200 --> 49:58.200]  It's unbelievable. And it's done formulatively. They put out the same talking points in Sweden they put out in the United States.
[49:58.200 --> 50:05.200]  That families suck and heterosexuality is bad and Christianity is bad and taking care of your kids is bad or having kids is bad.
[50:05.200 --> 50:13.200]  These are bad people. Death education was set up by the Democrats 30 years ago to teach kids how to commit suicide.
[50:13.200 --> 50:20.200]  I've always told you about the videos when I'd go out and protest at Planned Parenthood and always be a black man walk over a black woman.
[50:20.200 --> 50:28.200]  And they'd say you don't want to have all these and then say racist stuff about black people. You don't want to have all these black people around.
[50:28.200 --> 50:35.200]  You want to kill them. And I learned there's always local black managers that basically meet with the KKK. I'm not kidding folks.
[50:35.200 --> 50:46.200]  They mean business. I'm going to play that next hour. Another one of these legislators came out and he said you kill them when they're in the mama or you kill them later.
[50:46.200 --> 50:58.200]  And he wants these kids and I've got clips in in game up the head of the Texas Psychiatric Bureau saying we give kids all these vaccines and put them on eight drugs because they're got bad genes.
[50:58.200 --> 51:06.200]  We're getting rid of them basically. Man, these people are sick and they're out in the open telling you who they are.
[51:06.200 --> 51:17.200]  They're evil with a capital E ladies and gentlemen, evil, evil, evil, evil. And they think you're so stupid.
[51:17.200 --> 51:28.200]  They've got Brian Williams as the fact checker on MSNBC. We're going to get to that report coming up when I start the next hour and a lot of other ones I just mentioned.
[51:28.200 --> 51:32.200]  But let me hit on something that's near and dear to me.
[51:32.200 --> 51:43.200]  Let's just go ahead and roll this clip. Here's that David Hogg of the the arrogant anti gun spokesperson. Here he is.
[51:43.200 --> 51:54.200]  Getting saying Alex Joe. Sorry, I want to mention his name. When individuals say these things to us, I think it's important for their viewing audience to realize they're simply trying to make money off them.
[51:54.200 --> 52:05.200]  For example, one of the main people in this situation that I don't want to name the name of, but as you said, it's from Info Wars. He shots a lot. I'll just give you that and he looks red.
[52:05.200 --> 52:15.200]  He's advertising many of these things and the power lies in these advertisers to pull out of these fear mongering, hate loving people that just want to spread hate and division in America.
[52:15.200 --> 52:26.200]  For example, on Info Wars, one of the main things that he spoke, one of his famous things is saying that one of his most famous statements was saying that Topwater is turning the frogs gay and will turn you gay too.
[52:26.200 --> 52:35.200]  First off, gay people are awesome. I don't think that's a problem at all. And secondly, if you notice at the end of that video, he advertises water filters.
[52:35.200 --> 52:46.200]  Incredible deduction, my dear Watson. No, everything where him is deception. And so he's trying to put that deception model into my model.
[52:46.200 --> 52:54.200]  No, I'm openly saying the water is filled with glyphosate. It's filled with atrazine. It will hurt you. Number one thing you can do is filter your water.
[52:54.200 --> 53:00.200]  By the way, we have the highest rated best filters. There's like five different brands out there that have the highest ratings. We go buy those. We sell them due to discount.
[53:00.200 --> 53:07.200]  We have Alexa Pure Pro running right now. $50 off. It's already discounted price. That is the lowest ever. It is an amazing deal.
[53:07.200 --> 53:14.200]  And Mike Adams with his big lab tested it and found that it's the cleanest and fastest acting he's ever seen. Stainless steel on top of it.
[53:14.200 --> 53:24.200]  Stainless steel for the same price. There's another brand that will do it, but it's plastic and doesn't even send as much water through the system.
[53:24.200 --> 53:31.200]  Now, why is that important? Because suddenly it's all over the news, not just Flint, Michigan, but California, Texas, everywhere.
[53:31.200 --> 53:39.200]  The water is so incredibly toxic, hundreds of chemicals, hundreds of drugs. It's terrible. And of course they sell the news.
[53:39.200 --> 53:46.200]  The only way you can do it is to properly filter and you better have the right filter. But imagine the media calls me a conspiracy theorist.
[53:46.200 --> 53:56.200]  You know why you better filter your water in Texas and you better have your house tested right on gas, radiation down in the limestone?
[53:56.200 --> 54:03.200]  There are hundreds of towns that have done the test and found that it's as bad as Fukushima and you want to worry about getting cancer.
[54:03.200 --> 54:10.200]  It's because it's bad water. You heard about towns that failed because it turned out the water was bad and people moved out.
[54:10.200 --> 54:21.200]  Well nowadays you just get cancer and die. No folks, you better filter your water. Up to half the water in this country, whether it's well or not, has radiation in it.
[54:21.200 --> 54:29.200]  Radioactive particles. Doesn't do too good for your liver or kidneys. Let me give you a little news flash. You better filter your water.
[54:29.200 --> 54:36.200]  Yes, it funds our operation. Damn right I want money. I'm in a total war with the globalists. Toad of toe. I can do a lot more with a lot more money.
[54:36.200 --> 54:42.200]  Until I sell you the very best thing for you and your family that I get good mojo off of. That's my rule.
[54:42.200 --> 54:49.200]  Of course I sell you the absolute best thing for you that you number one absolutely must have to fund our operation against the pedophile devil worshippers.
[54:49.200 --> 54:57.200]  Damn right I want money to fight these pieces of crap. Sorry, let's go to these local newscasts. All over the country, here it is.
[54:57.200 --> 55:08.200]  Cancer and water. Two words that no one wants to hear in one sentence. After a year long research looking into California water data from 2010 to 2015,
[55:08.200 --> 55:17.200]  Dr. Stober, along with her colleagues, found that everyday Californians are exposed to contaminants that can cause cancer one drop at a time.
[55:17.200 --> 55:22.200]  A new study claims a drinking tap water in California could increase your risk of cancer.
[55:22.200 --> 55:30.200]  And just focus on Los Angeles. They actually looked at thousands of areas at contaminants in public water systems all over the state of California.
[55:30.200 --> 55:36.200]  Here's what they found when they looked at that water. They found arsenic, chromium, radioactive chemicals including uranium and radium.
[55:36.200 --> 55:42.200]  The study found those contaminants could contribute to about 15,500 cancer cases in California.
[55:42.200 --> 55:47.200]  California's public water systems could contribute to more than 15,000 cancer cases.
[55:47.200 --> 55:53.200]  And scientists found those contaminants could contribute to tens of thousands of cancer cases in California.
[55:53.200 --> 56:01.200]  Arsenic is related to lung cancer and skin cancer. Exposure to hexavalent chromium can increase your risk of stomach cancer.
[56:01.200 --> 56:07.200]  Disinfection byproducts can be associated with bladder cancer and other types of cancer.
[56:07.200 --> 56:12.200]  Now researchers say oftentimes these contaminants are analyzed one at a time and they're found to be safe.
[56:12.200 --> 56:17.200]  But together, the researchers say the contaminants can be found to be toxic and very, very dangerous.
[56:17.200 --> 56:22.200]  So we asked, what can you do? Will maybe boiling water kill these contaminants?
[56:22.200 --> 56:27.200]  The answer is no. Boiling water will only kill bacteria.
[56:27.200 --> 56:34.200]  So our best bet according to the study is to filter your water, but not everyone has access to filtered water.
[56:34.200 --> 56:42.200]  But David Hogg said, don't do that. I mean, you heard David Hogg. What's wrong with being gay and dying of cancer?
[56:42.200 --> 56:48.200]  I mean, the frogs only want to have sex with their male frogs and then the species dies.
[56:48.200 --> 56:52.200]  And then you get to have another extinct thing, but hey, what's wrong with being gay? You know what I mean?
[56:52.200 --> 56:55.200]  There you go. And that's just atrazine, by the way.
[56:55.200 --> 57:00.200]  It causes all sorts of other loving mutations that I'm sure everyone's going to enjoy.
[57:00.200 --> 57:12.200]  The point is, is that we have the best water filtration systems at the best prices that have the highest ratings that cut things down to zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.
[57:12.200 --> 57:20.200]  That means non-detectable levels. And if you're not filtering your water for your children or yourself, you are a crazy person.
[57:20.200 --> 57:23.200]  And if you're not funding our operation, you're nuts.
[57:23.200 --> 57:28.200]  But again, ladies and gentlemen, this is done on purpose. Look at photos of people 50 years ago.
[57:28.200 --> 57:33.200]  Look at them now. People look like zombies. It's been done on purpose.
[57:33.200 --> 57:37.200]  They add hydrofluorosalic acid to the water. That's not fluoride.
[57:37.200 --> 57:45.200]  That's an electrified acid system that then turbocharges everything and the other chemicals.
[57:45.200 --> 57:49.200]  They're adding, by the way, other chemicals on purpose.
[57:49.200 --> 57:57.200]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[57:57.200 --> 58:00.200]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[58:00.200 --> 58:06.200]  But I'll tell you like it is, you've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under. You're our only sponsors.
[58:06.200 --> 58:12.200]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[58:12.200 --> 58:19.200]  So remember, you are the InfoWare. I'm not the leader. You are the leader. When you take action, nothing stops you.
[58:19.200 --> 58:24.200]  We've got giant specials running right now at InfoWareStore.com that are unprecedented.
[58:24.200 --> 58:29.200]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board,
[58:29.200 --> 58:32.200]  get funds the Second American Revolution worldwide.
[58:32.200 --> 58:35.200]  So I want to thank you for your support and I want to encourage you again.
[58:35.200 --> 58:40.200]  Go to InfoWareStore.com for whatever the product is you need.
[58:40.200 --> 58:43.200]  We have thousands of them and it makes this all possible.
[58:43.200 --> 58:54.200]  Thank you for making InfoWare possible. God bless you.
[59:13.200 --> 59:18.200]  I'm going to show you a little bit of a new product that I've been using for a long time.
[59:18.200 --> 59:22.200]  It's a compact and easy to install and maintain.
[59:22.200 --> 59:28.200]  It keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.
[59:28.200 --> 59:36.200]  With its broad spectrum contaminant reduction, you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.
[59:36.200 --> 59:44.200]  Head to InfoWareStore.com and whether it's your first water filtration purchase or you're looking to replace your current rundown systems,
[59:44.200 --> 01:00:10.200]  it's time to go big and go home with the Pro Pure Hole House filtration system today.
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:39.200]  All right. Let's get serious. If you're a radio listener,
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:45.200]  you were missing out on different clubs of newscast in California where they show the water treatment plants
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:53.200]  and the green sludge that is all of the Prozac and all the Ritalin and all the tampons and all the blood and all the feces
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:01:01.200]  and all the thousands of chemicals and all the cleaning chemicals and everything that runs into the sewers.
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:10.200]  And then that goes into the water treatment facilities and they supposedly process it and they have something in California.
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:15.200]  Most people in California drink what they call toilet-to-tap.
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:24.200]  Toilet-to-tap. And then you wonder why cities under this, the people look like they've been shot with a mutation ray.
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:35.200]  Because the fluoride is added so that the other chemicals are boosted. It's an adjuvant.
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:40.200]  And this is all part of a larger plan. I was led in on some of the secret operations in Singapore
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:45.200]  where they do advanced neighborhood-by-neighborhood testing with drugs in the population.
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:55.200]  But they do some of that here too. And China actually has sensors in the sewers that test and track what drugs you're taking or what you're up to.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:02:06.200]  I mean, this is a very serpentine, labyrinthine, Byzantine system that's very complex.
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:16.200]  But just bottom line, the globalist said, and Bertrand Russell said, we will put chemicals in the water to lower fertility and make them more manageable.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:22.200]  And there's a key word, servile. Can we look at the definition of servile? Slave-like.
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:31.200]  I haven't looked at it in years, but slave-like. You do what you're told. You are a base goblin-like creature.
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:40.200]  It kind of slithers around its belly, groveling. There you go. Let's see the definition.
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:50.200]  Having or showing an excessive willingness to serve or please others, he bowed his head in a servile manner.
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:03:03.200]  Fawning, ingratiating, oily, greasy, cringy, slavish, craven, self-abasing.
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:07.200]  And you look at everybody groveling to Hollywood, the servileness of it.
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:15.200]  And our country turning into a bunch of servile. Oh, the political correctness. Oh, you're a racist. Oh, do whatever you say.
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:20.200]  You're a homophobe. Oh, here have my children. I will.
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:27.200]  And then the fact that in this big industrial society, even if they weren't trying to do it on purpose,
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:31.200]  I mean, I didn't know about the water when I was a kid.
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:37.200]  And I remember drinking Dallas water, and it tasted like whiskey or something, you know.
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:43.200]  It was like, it was like, it tasted, and I remember going to Houston, you could almost light Houston water on fire back then.
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:49.200]  Almost everybody I know that had kids of the 70s or 80s in Houston, you know, had one or two that were deformed or died.
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:52.200]  You know, I mean, Houston's big old toxic waste dump.
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:04:00.200]  But oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You just need to, you just need to drink up, and you need to enjoy it,
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:04.200]  and you need to shrivel up, and you need to die.
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:09.200]  You can go to Snopes and everywhere and they say, Jones is a dirty con man.
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:13.200]  A snake oil salesman. He says the water is poisonous.
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:18.200]  And then he sells filters, like, again, like, oh, did you see how manipulative he is?
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:21.200]  He snuck up with, you need to buy one of these.
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:27.200]  It's so manipulative. That's why, through the Electric Pure Pro and the Pro Pure,
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:32.200]  the both apples and oranges are both excellent on FullWareStore.com, it's good water, it tastes good.
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:38.200]  But if I really want to treat myself, I like this Italian 2,000-year-old spring aquapano.
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:41.200]  I mean, this is the American Coca-Cola. This is just sweet water, man.
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:44.200]  So, you know, I'm Rolls Royce in it right here, baby.
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:48.200]  But let me tell you something. You're not putting tap water in me, Bubba, ever.
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:52.200]  And if you're out on the farm, you know how much runoff chemicals from farming's in that water?
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:58.200]  That'll kill you even faster. But don't listen to me. Just drink up and die.
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:02.200]  I want to say BrainForce is great. I want to say TurboForce is amazing. It is.
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:08.200]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:11.200]  The fish oil's better than it. And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:16.200]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:20.200]  You've got the children's, you've got the adults, you've got the krill oil.
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:23.200]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:27.200]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps.
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:30.200]  And I'm sorry, you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:33.200]  The krill is hallucinogenic. It's so good. In my view.
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:35.200]  I'm not a biomedical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:38.200]  I eat five capillettes of krill oil before I go to bed.
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:41.200]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:47.200]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:52.200]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess,
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:06:00.200]  because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you. I just can't do it.
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:11.200]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones,
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:16.200]  coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:20.200]  Attorney General William Barr appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee yesterday
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:23.200]  because the Democrats wanted to yell at him for several hours straight
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:28.200]  after he decided not to indict President Trump for obstruction of justice
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:31.200]  because he complained about the Mueller investigation.
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:36.200]  Mr. Barr, now the American people know that you are no different from Rudy Giuliani
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:41.200]  or Kellyanne Conway or any of the other people who sacrificed their once
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:45.200]  decent reputation for the grifter and liar who sits in the Oval Office.
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:51.200]  But now, we know more about your deep involvement in trying to cover up for Donald Trump.
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:54.200]  Being Attorney General of the United States is a sacred trust.
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:07:00.200]  You have betrayed that trust. America deserves better. You should resign.
[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:02.200]  I have some questions for you.
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:06.200]  Okay, well, I think you get the point, and that pretty much went on all afternoon.
[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:10.200]  MSNBC couldn't even wait until after the hearings that complained about it,
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:16.200]  so they decided to interrupt Bill Barr's testimony halfway through to tell their viewers that he's a liar.
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:20.200]  Our IRA, I think it's called, began as early as 2000.
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:26.200]  Again, our intention always is to bring as much of this uninterrupted to you as possible.
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:30.200]  Dick Durbin's coming up after Republican Senator Cornyn of Texas,
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:36.200]  but so much has been said here and placed on the record by the Attorney General
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:41.200]  that starting with Nicole Wallace, we want to correct some of the record against,
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:44.200]  of all things, what it says in the Mueller report.
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:46.200]  Ryan, he's literally testifying live right now.
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:51.200]  Who could you just at least wait until a break or after the hearing to throw in your two cents?
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.200]  So, I'm not going to dance around this. He's lying.
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:58.200]  He's lying about what the Mueller report finds around one of the critical flashpoints
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.200]  in the obstruction investigation.
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:03.200]  It gets even better because during their live armchair quarterbacking,
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:06.200]  Nicole Wallace had a little potty mouth problem.
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:08.200]  I'm going to bleep it out, but this went out over the air
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:11.200]  to the few dozen people who are watching MSNBC.
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:16.200]  Don McGahn says to Ryan Priebus, which is the third witness to this incident,
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:19.200]  the president asked me to do some crazy sh**.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:23.200]  I'm sorry to swear, but I think we've got an Attorney General lying
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:25.200]  about what is in the Mueller report.
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:27.200]  And my question again is why?
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:32.200]  A better question is why does anyone waste their time watching MSNBC?
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:37.200]  Meanwhile, James Comey published an op-ed in The New York Times about Bill Barr's testimony
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:41.200]  and said that President Trump ate his soul.
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:45.200]  Even CNN is wondering why he decided to take a break from wandering around the woods
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:48.200]  and inject himself into the news cycle again.
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:50.200]  He wrote an op-ed in The New York Times,
[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:53.200]  James Comey how Trump co-ops leaders like Bill Barr,
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:09:00.200]  which includes saying that Mr. Trump eats your soul in small bites.
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:05.200]  Well, I don't know why James Comey feels the need to weigh in at every sort of large moment.
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:06.200]  You know why.
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:07.200]  Yes, you do.
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:08.200]  You absolutely know why.
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:10.200]  Well, I'm kind of, I'm just sort of thinking about that.
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:13.200]  Because he has Trump through agent syndrome just like the rest of you.
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:17.200]  Joe Scarborough's got it so bad he just hung up a picture of Robert Mueller in his house
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:24.200]  alongside members of his family, which was videotaped by his wife and co-host Mika Brzezinski,
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:26.200]  and then shared on Twitter.
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:29.200]  It's bigger than all the ones of his family members.
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:32.200]  And look who we have here.
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:35.200]  After Robert Mueller wrapped up his witch hunt at the end of March,
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:39.200]  CNN's ratings dropped in April 26%.
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:45.200]  Forbes Magazine reports that as CNN prepares to move its primetime studios in operations
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:50.200]  to a glitzy new building at New York City's brand new Hudson Yards development,
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:58.200]  the network saw its primetime lineup drop 26% in April compared to the same month a year ago.
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:05.200]  CNN's total audience in primetime was well under a million viewers, averaging 767,000,
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:10.200]  which I may add is about one third of the number of viewers that my YouTube videos get,
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:13.200]  and I'm just a guy at a laptop in my kitchen.
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:19.200]  April ranks CNN's lowest rated month among total viewers in nearly four years.
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:23.200]  The big mystery is how CNN was able to maintain that many viewers for this long.
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:29.200]  You would think that after a few weeks of reporting on the same story every single night that everyone would tune out,
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:33.200]  but apparently Democrats have an attention span of goldfish.
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:35.200]  They do have one more trick up their sleeve.
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:39.200]  However, Robert Mueller himself is scheduled to testify in just a few weeks,
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:42.200]  and then I'm sure that they'll finally put this behind him.
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:46.200]  I'm just kidding. They're never going to let this go until after Donald Trump is out of office,
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:50.200]  which hopefully won't be for another six years.
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:55.200]  Good job, Mark Dice. Let me just say I'm going to focus really intensely in that segment
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:59.200]  and give some of these clips and break down what happened yesterday and what's happening today,
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.200]  but let me just say this again.
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:06.200]  The deep state is never going to stop trying to take this country down.
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:10.200]  They're never going to stop trying to sabotage the nation.
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:16.200]  It's going to be very, very nasty removing them and prosecuting them, but it has to be done.
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:19.200]  They're not going to stop. They've got 18 fake investigations on Trump.
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:22.200]  They've got a bunch of them on me and everybody else that supports the country.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:25.200]  They're trying to demoralize the military. They're trying to sack the economy.
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:29.200]  They're trying to raise interest rates to sabotage the recovery.
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:33.200]  They are just engaged in incredible crime. They want totally open borders.
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:37.200]  They don't want anybody vetted for diseases, unprecedented.
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:39.200]  They are killing babies after they're born.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.200]  That's now the official Democrat Party platform.
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:46.200]  I'm not kidding. Got more clips today coming up, and they've just got to be stopped.
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:50.200]  And beyond that, they are counting on us not having memories.
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:53.200]  Maybe they don't have memories, but Brian Williams said he got shot down in a helicopter.
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:56.200]  It was all made up. He didn't get shot at.
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:59.200]  Just like Hillary, but now he's the fact-checker on Trump.
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:03.200]  And we can actually fact-check it. Trump's been honest about everything.
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:06.200]  He's flip-flopped on a couple issues like vaccines and things, but that's it.
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:08.200]  I mean, it's just crazy how they lie.
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:11.200]  So here's Tucker Carlson laying this out last night.
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:15.200]  MSNBC, if you're watching today, you may have noticed, could not contain its excitement
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:17.200]  during the Attorney General's testimony.
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:20.200]  During the hearing, Senator Lindsey Graham noted quite correctly
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:25.200]  that Mueller's report found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:30.200]  Brian Williams wouldn't have it, though. He cut in to call Graham a liar.
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:33.200]  So what have we learned from this report?
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:41.200]  After all this time and all this money, Mr. Mueller and his team concluded there was no collusion.
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:43.200]  If there's no underlying crime...
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:47.200]  We're lucky to do this, we rarely do, but the chairman of the judiciary committee
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:51.200]  just said that Mueller found there was no collusion.
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:56.200]  That is not correct, that phrase, or the lack of it.
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:59.200]  It's absence from federal code.
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:03.200]  Hold on, back that up. It's absence from federal code.
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:07.200]  Just made up. And tell us about that RPG that blew the helicopter up again.
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:11.200]  Brian, you think we don't remember? You got let go, and I told people he'd be back.
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:15.200]  They'll probably have Jesse Smollett back soon, you know, and say his attack was real.
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:20.200]  Oh, wait, they are. They're announcing he's coming back to empire, and that it's okay, and he was attacked.
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:22.200]  Here, let's go back to it.
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:26.200]  Not correct, that phrase, or the lack of it.
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:34.200]  It's absence from federal code. This no-collusion mantra is so foundational to why we're seeing it.
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:38.200]  The report, which they were forced to tell the truth, though, because nobody bit on the setups,
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:42.200]  was that no American accepted any offers from Russians.
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:46.200]  And almost all the so-called Russians we know were informants, and it was setups.
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:49.200]  Geez, just go back to it.
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:55.200]  It's not rational to why we're here today that we decided to flag it when we heard him use it yet again.
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:57.200]  Back into the statement.
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:03.200]  Do you hear the pretentiousness? We decided to flag it. We're the referees.
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:06.200]  You know, we've got Snopes saying that there's no poison in the water.
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:09.200]  Jones is a liar. You know, it's all over the news.
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:12.200]  And we say this, and we say that. Continue.
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:19.200]  So foundational to why we're here today that we decided to flag it when we heard him use it yet again.
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:22.200]  Back into the chairman and the committee.
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:27.200]  Yeah, this is another fact check from a guy suspended for lying.
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:31.200]  Don't even mean nice guy, but please get some self-awareness.
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.200]  It wasn't the only time something like that happened, though, today.
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:38.200]  An hour later, they cut away again to say that Barr was a big, fat liar, too.
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:39.200]  Watch this.
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:46.200]  So much has been said here and placed on the record by the attorney general that, starting with Nicole Wallace,
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:53.200]  we want to correct some of the record against, of all things, what it says in the Mueller report, Nicole.
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:56.200]  So I'm not going to dance around this. He's lying.
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:02.200]  He's lying about what the Mueller report finds around one of the critical flashpoints in the obstruction investigation.
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:09.200]  When you're turning to Nicole Wallace as a fact checker, you've got all the way.
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:12.200]  Joe Contra writes about media for the Hill, and he joins us tonight.
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:18.200]  I mean, I don't look, I've always liked Brian Williams. He's very funny, actually, and he's always nice every time I've dealt with him.
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:19.200]  Also a great storyteller.
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:25.200]  He's a full MSNBC. I mean, he used to be like an NBC News guy. He still has the voice, but like, this is pathetic, right?
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:28.200]  I'll stop there. The full clips on M4s.com. It's worth watching.
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:31.200]  Now, let's go to Pelosi as we go out to break.
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:35.200]  She says that, oh, Barr is a liar. He's going to get arrested now. Here it is.
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:41.200]  He lied to Congress. He lied to Congress.
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:45.200]  If anybody else did that, it would be considered a crime.
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:49.200]  Nobody is above the law, not the president of the United States.
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:53.200]  That's all they do is lie in front of Congress. He didn't lie.
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:57.200]  But my God, she ain't looking too good. She looks like a reanimated corpse.
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:01.200]  Stocks and options trading involves financial risk and is not suitable for all investors.
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:04.200]  Hey, guys, it's Scott Bauer here, CEO of Prosper Trading Academy.
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:06.200]  Are you looking for a super hot stock tip?
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:10.200]  Here at Prosper, we are always looking for exciting opportunities in the markets.
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:14.200]  And right now, all my students are salivating over the stock we are watching.
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:20.200]  In fact, I've got this hot stock written down right here, and I'm about to text it to you for free.
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:22.200]  I just need to know where to send it.
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:28.200]  Simply text HOT to 48542, and I'll text it to you instantly.
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:30.200]  How do I know this stock is so hot?
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:33.200]  Well, I'm a former CBOE market maker for Amazon Options,
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:39.200]  former vice president of Goldman Sachs, and I have over 25 years of professional trading experience.
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:43.200]  I'm telling you, this stock is hot. But be warned, the stock may move soon,
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:45.200]  so you need to claim it before it does.
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:50.200]  Text HOT to 48542, and I'll text you this hot stock instantly.
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:52.200]  Message and data rates may apply.
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:25.200]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:29.200]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:31.200]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:37.200]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventive
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:58.200]  way to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:13.200]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:16.200]  is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:21.200]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:26.200]  that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:29.200]  We have developed, hands down, from our research,
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:35.200]  the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:38.200]  There's nothing else like it. You must experience it.
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:45.200]  It is a total game changer, and it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:48.200]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong. It lasts 10 hours.
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:52.200]  So take a half packet the first time you take it, because TurboForce is named TurboForce
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:54.200]  because it will take you into overdrive.
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:19:06.200]  TurboForce at InfoWarsStore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:11.200]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:14.200]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:16.200]  How can I solve that problem?
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:20.200]  So we have air filters at InfoWarsStore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze,
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:30.200]  which is right now $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking ion cluster air filter technology.
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:33.200]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:37.200]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:41.200]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:49.200]  I've got two in my home. You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:57.200]  Don't live in a polluted major city in your home. Have clean air. Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:23.200]  From the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:45.200]  All right, I want to open the phones up to callers specifically on this issue.
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:50.200]  You agree with me that the Civil War is now spilling into the streets
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:55.200]  and the Democrats are getting ready to go hot with their operations to try to remove Trump even more
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:57.200]  instead of backing down and suing for peace?
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:00.200]  I mean, that's what's happening, but I'm going to get your take on it.
[01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:04.200]  And Trump clearly has signaled publicly that he knows there was an attempted coup,
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:06.200]  that the plotters must be punished.
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:10.200]  I was in D.C. last week, talked to three people, two that met with him personally,
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:13.200]  another that talked to him and talked to others.
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.200]  Trump's going all out against him.
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:19.200]  And then Barr's up there really trying to end this thing
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:23.200]  and cover up their illegal spying to a certain point on Trump is to end it.
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:27.200]  And they're not going to have it. And now they're saying that Barr is a liar
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:31.200]  and that Barr lied to Congress and they don't even say what he lied about.
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:35.200]  Let's play that clip of Pelosi again, who I don't say this meanly,
[01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:40.200]  but she looks like dead bodies I've seen of anorexics and things.
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:45.200]  I mean, she looks like a starvation victim and she can hardly talk,
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.200]  neither can Biden.
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:51.200]  And I think it's emblematic of this establishment doesn't know when to quit.
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:55.200]  I mean, just archetypally, Trump with all this energy, you with all this energy,
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:56.200]  me with all this energy.
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:22:00.200]  And then you've got them over there, Nadler and Pelosi and Michael Moore
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:04.200]  and Hillary stumbling around and trying to demoralize and AOC saying,
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:09.200]  you know, shut up white people and Ilhan, all of them saying white people are bad.
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:16.200]  I mean, these are a bunch of nasty, nasty people who really think they're eagles working.
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:21.200]  But how long we let them just behave like this and act like this and terrorize everybody
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:25.200]  when they're the ones that have been caught red handed doing all this horrible stuff.
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:30.200]  So here's Pelosi again, saying that Barr lied to Congress that no one else ever,
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:35.200]  A, he didn't lie to Congress, B, Comey, Hillary, they all did it over and over again.
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:40.200]  The projection, the inversion, the upside down world of what she says is incredible.
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:41.200]  Here it is.
[01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:47.200]  He lied to Congress. He lied to Congress.
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:51.200]  If anybody else did that, it would be considered a crime.
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:56.200]  Nobody is above the law, not the president of the United States and not the attorney general.
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:23:02.200]  Being the attorney general does not give you a bath to go say whatever you want.
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:05.200]  And it is the fact because you are the attorney general.
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:06.200]  It just isn't true.
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:08.200]  Should he go to jail for it?
[01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:12.200]  There's a process involved here.
[01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:14.200]  And as I said, I'll say it again.
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:16.200]  And how many questions you have.
[01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:22.200]  The committee will act upon how we will proceed.
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:27.200]  So they invested godlike power in Mueller.
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:33.200]  And then the guy that was his boss and brought him in to the Justice Department gets rehired.
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:37.200]  The Democrats respected Barr so much from the past because he was bipartisan.
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:40.200]  They go, okay, well, we'll, you know, basically unanimously approve him.
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:45.200]  He gets in and then all the evidence is they committed crimes against America,
[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:49.200]  against Trump, against me, against thousands of others that got persecuted.
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:53.200]  And Barr is like, you need to back off and you need to stop it right now.
[01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:55.200]  Now you illegally spied and you did all this.
[01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:59.200]  And Trump will leave you alone if you just, oh, you're not going to stop.
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:02.200]  They're like, no, you're a criminal now too.
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:09.200]  And they start hanging pictures of Mueller up at the Democrats' houses and worshiping him like he's God.
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:13.200]  He delivered uranium to the Russians on the tarmac.
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:15.200]  He oversaw the Clinton Foundation.
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:20.200]  They had Jeanne Ray, the head lawyer for her foundation, up to her eyeballs in my view in espionage,
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:23.200]  overseeing Roger Stone's prosecution.
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:27.200]  Can you imagine walking into the prosecutors and it's the person that works for the Russians
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:32.200]  and the Chinese telling you you did something?
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:35.200]  Splitting hairs over what Roger Stone said in Congress.
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:39.200]  And now they're saying Barr needs to be arrested.
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:43.200]  The toll-free number to join us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:46.200]  The toll-free number to join us.
[01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:48.200]  And we'll get you on air.
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:55.200]  It's 877-789-ALOX, 877-789-2539.
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:59.200]  That's 877-789-2539.
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:03.200]  Specifically on this one subject.
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:11.200]  Are you agreeing with me that this is goosebumps time like Ted Nugent said on the show yesterday
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:13.200]  that clearly they're not backing down.
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:14.200]  They're not stopping.
[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:17.200]  Did you watch those hearings foaming at the mouth?
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:26.200]  Just acting like complete buffoon liars and going, you suppressed 19 pages, you're hiding it.
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:28.200]  And they put it in the full report.
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:29.200]  It's a total lie.
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:38.200]  Hoping their constituents are so stupid, they're on CNN and MSNBC for weeks saying they had 19 pages.
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:40.200]  They didn't release 19 pages.
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:42.200]  It's in the report.
[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:44.200]  None of that 19 pages is redacted.
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:51.200]  The addendum or statement, the little political jab that Mueller puts in there.
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:54.200]  So again, who operates like this?
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:59.200]  Where it's verifiable lies that they're constantly telling.
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:04.200]  You have to remember, folks, if you go to blue areas, there's ultra-rich living in penthouses with helicopters.
[01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:08.200]  And then there are people defecating everywhere and like zombies.
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:09.200]  It's like a movie.
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:11.200]  Like, something took their souls.
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:15.200]  Like an alien, like a Stephen King movie down in the basement sucking their energy.
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:18.200]  I mean, I don't know what it is, but you go in blue areas, man.
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:24.200]  They look like somebody gave them lobotomies.
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:26.200]  And they believe whatever they're told.
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:27.200]  These are followers.
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:32.200]  These are weak, stupid, lazy followers who are dangerous.
[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:34.200]  Who are dangerous.
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:36.200]  And they're coming for your speech.
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:38.200]  They're coming for your kids.
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:41.200]  They're coming for everything because they believe it's theirs.
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:43.200]  They believe they're the ruling class.
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:46.200]  You tune into NPR, CNN, you're the ruling class.
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:48.200]  You're the great intelligentsia.
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:50.200]  They're not.
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:52.200]  What they are is very, very sad followers.
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:53.200]  We're going to go to break.
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:55.200]  We're going to come back with your calls directly on the other side.
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:57.200]  I'm also going to play Democrats talking about killing babies.
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:58.200]  How great it is.
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:00.200]  How they, you damn right they're humans.
[01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:03.200]  We want them dead.
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:04.200]  It's amazing.
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:06.200]  That's all coming up.
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:13.200]  And don't forget, we are running a bunch of specials right now that are the biggest ever
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:16.200]  because I want people to see how great these products are.
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:22.200]  And we have a special running right now that is X2, the deep-earth crystal, pure iodine
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:24.200]  that nobody else has, the good halogen.
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:25.200]  Learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:27.200]  Learn about the halogen conspiracy.
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.200]  Learn about IQ and iodine.
[01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:32.200]  Learn about deficiency of iodine and what it means, means death.
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:36.200]  And learn how the globalists are working around the clock, not just to poison your food and water,
[01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:40.200]  to dumb you down so they can control you and turn you into one of their minions.
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:45.200]  Down an Ursula's lair, like a little mermaid, still your voice quite literally.
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:49.200]  But what it does for the rest of your body, your stamina, your veto, your energy,
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:52.200]  it's the building block, it's the must have.
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:54.200]  Now X2 is amazing.
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:56.200]  It's super strong.
[01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:58.200]  And everybody should consult their physicians or whatever.
[01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:01.200]  This is all seen as generally safe, but still this is not games.
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:06.200]  It has a 98% vote rate, 4.9 stars.
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:09.200]  X2, by the grace of God, we're able to get it back.
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:10.200]  It's the original X2.
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:13.200]  Now X3 is when we thought we couldn't make this anymore,
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:15.200]  but we found a deep-earth crystal company.
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:18.200]  But as long as it's another formulation, you have to call it something else.
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:21.200]  So I'm going to call it X2 plus instead of call it X3.
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:26.200]  And then the argument set out that if we added two of the other types of iodine to it,
[01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:29.200]  that helps the upload of the pure iodine.
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:31.200]  Different strokes for different folks.
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:35.200]  You get a free bottle of X3 with a bottle of X2.
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:37.200]  And the X2 is 25% off.

[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:57.200]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:59.200]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:01.200]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:02.200]  I sued the IRS in one.
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:05.200]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:07.200]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement,
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:09.200]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:11.200]  they thought might never be solved.
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:12.200]  I can help you too.
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:15.200]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:17.200]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:22.200]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:26.200]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:56.200]  Trust your family's survival to survivalistgames.com.
[01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:02.200]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child
[01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:04.200]  that has supported this broadcast over the years
[01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:06.200]  and that has stood with us.
[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:09.200]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:13.200]  But I'll tell you like it is, you've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:15.200]  You're our only sponsors.
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:19.200]  And when you don't buy the products, they're absolutely the best out there.
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:21.200]  We aren't able to continue on.
[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:23.200]  So remember, you are the InfoWar.
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:25.200]  I'm not the leader. You are the leader.
[01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:27.200]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:30.200]  We've got giant specials running right now
[01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:32.200]  at InfoWarStore.com that are unprecedented.
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:36.200]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need
[01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:40.200]  from across the board, get funds to the Second American Revolution worldwide.
[01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:43.200]  So I want to thank you for your support, and I want to encourage you again.
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:48.200]  Go to infowarstore.com for whatever the product is you need.
[01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:51.200]  We have thousands of them, and it makes this all possible.
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:31:20.200]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible. God bless you.
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:23.200]  Have a great day.
[01:31:51.200 --> 01:32:06.200]  I just have to say something, man. It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:08.200]  It just gets old, man.
[01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:10.200]  I'm going to shut you down right now.
[01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:13.200]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:17.200]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:20.200]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:23.200]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:25.200]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:27.200]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:29.200]  You know what, Alex?
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:34.200]  Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear.
[01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:36.200]  We're under attack. We need your help.
[01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:40.200]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:43.200]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:47.200]  You understand? I need your help, Frank. I need your help, Frank.
[01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:53.200]  Go to InfowarsStore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:55.200]  Do you understand? I need your help, Frank.
[01:32:55.200 --> 01:33:19.200]  Free press needs your help, Frank.
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:23.200]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:26.200]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:30.200]  We're going to your phone calls in a moment, but this is what's got the old Democrats so rattled
[01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:34.200]  calling for AG Barr to resign, calling for criminal charges against him
[01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:36.200]  for supposed perjury to Congress with no evidence.
[01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:42.200]  When we've got open and shut cases against dozens of Democrats, including Comey, Hillary Clinton,
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:44.200]  you name it, for lying to Congress.
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:48.200]  This has got him really, really scared because he points out there are a bunch of criminal investigations
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:51.200]  going into leakers. Here it is.
[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:55.200]  Mr. General found that during the department's investigation of Hillary Clinton
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:34:02.200]  for mishandling highly classified information, there was a culture of unauthorized media contacts.
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:05.200]  During the Russian investigation, the leaks continued.
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:09.200]  Leaks undermined the ability of investigators to investigate.
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:18.200]  Further leaks to the papers while Congress's questions to the department go on answered is unacceptable.
[01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:23.200]  Why? What are you doing to investigate unauthorized media contacts
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:28.200]  by the department and FBI officials during the Russian investigation?
[01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:34.200]  We have multiple criminal leak investigations underway.
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:38.200]  Thank you.
[01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:41.200]  You overreached, you little turds.
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:45.200]  And so all the stuff you've done to me and my family, guess what? Turnabouts fair play.
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:50.200]  I won't wept your family, but I'm assuring you that God and justice is coming for you.
[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:55.200]  You are not going to defeat this country and piss all over us with the chikoms.
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:35:01.200]  With that witch Hillary on Mad Cal last night openly saying chikoms, save us.
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:05.200]  They've been trying to save you, witch, for a long time. They're not going to.
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:09.200]  You ugly pumpkin-headed demon. Obviously it looks like a demon.
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:13.200]  Sometimes the cover matches the internals, doesn't it, of the book.
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:18.200]  That demon pumpkin, an evil look in her eyes. She has a right to rule everybody.
[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:21.200]  What a witch. Bottom of the barrel. Okay, I'm going to stop ranting.
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:25.200]  It's just that the war is on, folks. It's on.
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:29.200]  The Democrats aren't backing down. The chikoms aren't backing down. Hollywood's not backing down.
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:33.200]  I'm not backing down. Trump's not backing down. This is a incredible time.
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:37.200]  Trump's federal reserve made them stop raising interest rates.
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:41.200]  Notice the economy turned back around. I mean, this is real, folks.
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:45.200]  This is a real fight. Info wars is real. Trump is real.
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:48.200]  Doesn't mean we're infallible or perfect, but we love America. We want prosperity.
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:51.200]  We don't hate the country. We're not trying to sell it out.
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:54.200]  We believe in its foundational values, just like you do.
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:36:00.200]  And you are all in the arena by listening and spreading the word and praying and supporting the broadcast
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:03.200]  and being involved yourselves. You are the men and women in the arena.
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:06.200]  You are the resistance. Let's go to the calls now.
[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:11.200]  We've got Neal and Danny and H.B. and Pastor Sam and Bill and Doug and Gene and Deporable Hill and Tracy.
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:15.200]  That'll be all the calls I can get to as Leigh Ann's coming in, but I will continue with your calls after that.
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:19.200]  Who should we go to? Who's been holding the long? Yes.
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:24.200]  Let's go ahead and talk to Doug in Connecticut. Doug, you're on the air. How will the Dems strike back?
[01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:27.200]  The fight's on. You can tell. Do you think I'm wrong?
[01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:30.200]  Oh, no, I think you're absolutely right, Alex.
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:37.200]  You know, I'm sitting back watching all the news reports, and we had our little shooter guy at the college the other day there.
[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:41.200]  And what do I see today? Oh, gee, he was researching Sandy Hook.
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:47.200]  And right off the bat, I'm like, there they go, putting that out there again, trying to blame everything on Alex Jones.
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:51.200]  So not only do they think we're dumb, they think we're really stupid.
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:56.200]  You know, because I mean, I'm like, you know, everything to me, I doubt it at first.
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:37:05.200]  They're all CIA wind-up toys, I believe, you know, whether directly influenced by the CIA or through the media and who knows what else.
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:12.200]  And I want to be clear. The CIA, the FBI, these are all just like a piece of machinery for deep staters to control.
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:16.200]  There are a lot of people at the CIA like Pompeo and others that are good. They're trying to turn this around.
[01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:19.200]  But it's the leftist stay-behind networks inside of there.
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:24.200]  I'm really concerned that they are going to pull off some major false flags to blame conservatives.
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:28.200]  That's why it's critical that we don't take the blame for whatever they cook up when they do it.
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:37.200]  That's exactly right. And I mean, I think most of your listeners were all prepared, but we can't emphasize enough to keep carrying, keep training.
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:41.200]  Everywhere I go, I start up a conversation about you at a show in the world order.
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:43.200]  My wife thinks I'm nuts, but that's just the way I am.
[01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:47.200]  And most people get it. Most people get it. And especially the high school age kids now.
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:52.200]  I ran it the one the other day, who was really awake, knew all about you, knew all about your banning and everything.
[01:37:52.200 --> 01:38:00.200]  So the consciousness is out there. The media is just trying to push the thought that nobody thinks Trump is bad.
[01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:04.200]  They're trying to push that, but more people are awake than we think.
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:06.200]  Man, what else was I going to say?
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:08.200]  Well, no, no, that's a great point.
[01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:14.200]  And listen, I got mobbed in D.C. by groups of high schoolers that were there, I guess, on field trips, mobbed.
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:17.200]  I mean, we have the video. We haven't put it out yet because there's so much of it.
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:22.200]  A mobbed over and over again by groups of high schoolers. And it's not about, oh, look, I'm famous. Who cares about that?
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:25.200]  They're awake. They're involved. They know what's going on.
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:31.200]  But we need to be in constant communication with them to mobilize them to wake up others.
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:34.200]  And it was great. They were black. They were white. They were Hispanic. They were Asian.
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:39.200]  They were old. They were young. And it's just exciting. God bless you. I appreciate your call, Doug. They're in Connecticut.
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:44.200]  Let's go to another call here. Let's go ahead and talk to Danny in Virginia.
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:47.200]  Danny, you're on the air. Welcome.
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:50.200]  Hey, Alex, thanks for letting me on again. I talked to you two weeks ago.
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:52.200]  I appreciate you calling. Thank you for calling.
[01:38:52.200 --> 01:39:00.200]  I was disturbed that in our conversation, you said that we couldn't become our enemies by lowering ourselves to their level.
[01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:05.200]  That's what they're counting on, that we have more and they're going to use that against us.
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:12.200]  We have to be willing to do what we have to do. And the president needs to do things that we may not agree with, but we have to support him.
[01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:17.200]  When I say that is we're not going to stage false flags of blaming on them. We're not going to do things like that.
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:23.200]  That's why we have the moral high ground towards Washington's example. I think it was right. I mean, specifically, how low would we go?
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:27.200]  I'm not going to target their family like they do our families.
[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:40.200]  Well, I don't want to target them so much as take them into protective custody so they can't be threatened by outside agencies to go along with silencing their parents or whoever we have in custody and are trying to prosecute.
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:48.200]  Well, look, here's the deal. I mean, this is going into a hot war if Trump doesn't snuff it out quickly. And so I get it. It's like Venezuela.
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:56.200]  I don't want to invade Venezuela, but it's collapsing into Central America and the U.S. It's being used to flood us. It is a threat to the United States.
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:59.200]  So what do we do at that point? We have to do something.
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:10.200]  I would like to see the president call Congress into an executive emergency session and threaten them with telling them that he's going to declassify sources and methods if he has to.
[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:19.200]  He's already done that and they're so mad dog. He has the total proof of their criminal activity that they're Chinese agents, that they're on the payroll, that Feinstein's gotten a billion bucks from them.
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:25.200]  They don't care that they're so used to power that they don't get it yet. That's what's so dangerous.
[01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:33.200]  Right. They're doubling down every chance they get because they think we're going to crumble. We're going to fight ourselves about what we have to do.
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:38.200]  Then let me ask you this then. OK, let's say a course of action. You researched this. What does the president need to do?
[01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:46.200]  I mean, a very quick thing to do is if they did start to fight and they are criminals and they are globalists and we're the American team, is that Trump would decapitate?
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:49.200]  What about a thousand of them in one day?
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:54.200]  Well, I take them into custody. I don't know if we want to decapitate, but we can certainly.
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:58.200]  If you say you want to not have any rules, then it all turns into a big circus.
[01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:04.200]  The only thing they understand is power. I'm not saying do this. I'm not a trigger guy.
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:08.200]  The point is we're going down a road with them that if they could decapitate us, they'd do it.
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:13.200]  So I'm just simply saying the quickest, easiest thing to do is the command and control system is wipe out their command and control.
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:19.200]  They're not Americans. They're multinational bidders, middlemen selling us out. You understand that, right?
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:22.200]  These aren't Americans. These are enemy forces in this country.
[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:27.200]  I would like to see President Trump use the tools and the powers that they wanted to give to Hillary Clinton.
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:34.200]  If she were president, she would be a dictator. I think he has to say these are the powers you wanted to give to her.
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:39.200]  I'm going to use them. You're going to hate it because I use them and then you're going to take them away.
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:41.200]  And that's a good thing. We want the power.
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:44.200]  Absolutely. And we're only doing hypotheticals here. I don't want to go down this road.
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:46.200]  I think Trump's been judicious about so far.
[01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:51.200]  The problem is they've been caught in attempted coup. They've been terrorizing everybody.
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:56.200]  They've got anti-foot training with MS-13 to start assassinations. That's confirmed now.
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:05.200]  And I'm just saying it's like having a dog with rabies coming towards your kids at the park. What do you do?
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:12.200]  You do whatever is necessary to stop the dog, but we can't fault ourselves for defending ourselves.
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:15.200]  I know what I'm telling you is they're going to blow up federal buildings and blame us.
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:21.200]  I'm not for any type of offensive stuff. We need to start indicting these people now and they will roll.
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:27.200]  But I wouldn't just indict low-level people. I would go after the high-level ones and just start the indictments.
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:32.200]  Trump needs to start declassifying. Now, take the gloves off. They're not going to back off.
[01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:36.200]  I agree with you, God bless. Anything else?
[01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:41.200]  By the way, folks, this is not hyperbole where we've gotten here. This is not hype.
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:45.200]  This is the real world, folks. This is where we are in 2019.
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:51.200]  You have got the Democratic Party whose operating system is. America was never great. It'll never be great.
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:57.200]  Get rid of the borders. Everybody that's a conservative is a Nazi. White people are evil. Capitalism is bad.
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:04.200]  Stacey in the great state of Texas in FEMA Region 6. You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:11.200]  Good to talk to you. Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:17.200]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force. I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that that I trust.
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:22.200]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins. They don't have things that they say that they have in them.
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:24.200]  And they're often not things that are natural. I appreciate that.
[01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:26.200]  Well, what happened with ultimate female force? Tell us about it.
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:31.200]  Well, it's really great. You know, it's like a multivitamin. I take it. It tastes good. It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:36.200]  It has kind of a pleasant aftertaste. And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:41.200]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are. They're known to turbo-charge women.
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:46.200]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it. So, yeah, stamina, libido, energy.
[01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:50.200]  These are amazing things in ultimate female force. So I'm glad you plugged it.

[01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:37.200]  Leanne Macken is going to be in the studio with us for the next hour.
[01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:42.200]  She went to take care of her grandmother for a year. Then she took off a year and has been living in the woods.
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:45.200]  And I saw her and I said, Leanne, you look ten years younger.
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:49.200]  I mean, she didn't look old before, but she looks like when she first came to work here like eight years ago.
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:52.200]  And she said, yeah, that's what happens. She goes, I'm like Rip Van Winkle.
[01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:58.200]  She said, I'm like Rip Van Winkle. I've not watched the news in a year. Wow.
[01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:02.200]  And she plunges right into here and we're talking about civil war and death.
[01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:09.200]  And, you know, here's the balance, folks. I don't want a violent civil war, obviously.
[01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:15.200]  But the globalists on the left are really trying to get that going and they've been caught doing it.
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:19.200]  And so that's where we are as a society.
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:24.200]  And we have to ask, what does the president legally and lawfully need to do?
[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:30.200]  And I think the indictments need to start right now in haste because the Democrats aren't going to stop.
[01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:35.200]  And it's just that simple. I mean, they have the nerve to claim that Trump and everybody else are these criminals
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:37.200]  when they've been caught red-handed in all these crimes.
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:42.200]  And they say, we don't like America when they're the hate America party. It's just crazy.
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:50.200]  And so the president's been very restrained and I think it's turned out that the deep state's in a lot of trouble because he's been so restrained.
[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:55.200]  But I can feel and also see politically going into this season that the gloves have to come off now.
[01:48:55.200 --> 01:49:02.200]  And I don't think that means decapitation. That's a government term for taking out the leadership of the opposition group.
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:05.200]  That's what they've tried to do politically with a political hit.
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:16.200]  The problem is, if they keep escalating their crimes, it's going to become the duty of the executive branch to move because this is not a normal political operation.
[01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:20.200]  This is an attempted dictatorship of this oligarchy.
[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:24.200]  Okay, let's go back to calls here who's been holding the longest.
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:28.200]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bill and then Lacey and others.
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:32.200]  Bill, in Oklahoma, you're on the air. What would you call this period of history we're in right now?
[01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:38.200]  I'll tell you what, it's a fake news cycle. That's for sure.
[01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:53.200]  I got a couple of questions, though. One question, why did it take so long for, I think it took like three to four weeks for Barr to get the grand jury testimony to him?
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:55.200]  That's pretty ridiculous.
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:50:11.200]  And the other question, what was the FBI telling and paying the anti-Trump dossier author, what's his name, Steele? What are those details I'd like to know?
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:15.200]  Well, actually, it came in a long time ago, but it's over a million dollars.
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:31.200]  The word is that the three million from the FBI, directly to wives of or and others. So they literally created the group within Fusion GPS and then paid themselves money for creating the piece of Pulp Fiction.
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:36.200]  Yeah, some of you are going to go to Jeff Allen, that's for sure.
[01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:45.200]  Oh, they're all red-handed. It's just red-handed. That became out the time, and that was the last time I, it came out two years ago that the FBI had paid three million.
[01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:52.200]  You know how much has been paid in the dossier total by the Democrats and everybody else? Last time I checked, I think 25 million.
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:55.200]  That's good work if you can get it, right?
[01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:58.200]  Yeah.
[01:50:58.200 --> 01:50:59.200]  Crazy.
[01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:03.200]  What do you think Trump should do? What should we do? I mean, this is a time bomb.
[01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:12.200]  You know, the easiest way to beat socialism and all this crap is just to keep doing what we're doing, push up their timetables and make them jump the shark.
[01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:15.200]  You only jump so many times before you're worn out.
[01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:22.200]  No, I agree. We just keep precedence and we keep the moral high ground and then we just, we just hold fast and they're going to fall in the end.
[01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:25.200]  They always do. God bless you. Great point.
[01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:29.200]  And again, this is all an open discussion, a war game of this.
[01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:35.200]  They're going to pick and choose to fight a context here. I'm a nonviolent person. I don't want any offensive action.
[01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:37.200]  But this is a cancerous outside group.
[01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:44.200]  So I'm saying all options are on the table and I backed the president basically whatever he does. Yeah, he has my trust at this point.
[01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:52.200]  And, you know, when you're in the foxhole for a long time too, you just start getting with the program because I know the enemy's evil.
[01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:56.200]  They hate Trump and they're coming after everybody and they're a pack of criminals.
[01:51:56.200 --> 01:52:04.200]  And I think Trump's been too lenient, but I just want to let the president know that they're, you know, I'm not one of these Monday morning quarterbacks.
[01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:10.200]  I want action and I want action now and I want these people off my ass and off everybody else's ass.
[01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:14.200]  And so, you know, it's unpopular going to Venezuela.
[01:52:14.200 --> 01:52:18.200]  I was against all these wars you've heard about over the years.
[01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:21.200]  This one is in our hemisphere. It's on our border basically.
[01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:23.200]  It's coordinating. It's working with Hezbollah.
[01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:27.200]  That's in the news today that Hezbollah and all the way up to MS-13 into the U.S.
[01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:31.200]  And thousands are starving to death a week and they're running over people with armored vehicles.
[01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:34.200]  I don't trust the neocons. They may try to set Trump up.
[01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:38.200]  I'm just saying inaction is action down there.
[01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:40.200]  So that's the debate. Maybe I'll bring it up and Liam McAduce see what she thinks.
[01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:45.200]  But that's a whole other show because Trump says he's going to do something next week.
[01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:49.200]  Now saying he's going to do something means Maduro who's basically already out of power.
[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:54.200]  The place is anarchy. And the place is super rich.
[01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:59.200]  I mean, it's got incredible oil, incredible gas, incredible timber, incredible soil, great culture.
[01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:02.200]  It used to be one of the richest places in this hemisphere.
[01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:07.200]  70 years ago, a Venezuelan had more money than a U.S. person.
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:09.200]  Now it's a hell of a hole.
[01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:14.200]  Because Commie's running, man. I'm digressing. I apologize.
[01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:18.200]  Let's talk to Neil. Then we'll go to Lacey and others and Deplorable and Pastor Sam and HB.
[01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:21.200]  Neil in Minnesota here on the air. What do you think is going on?
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:30.200]  I just think it kind of bothers me that Trump would even consider letting them off the hook or suing for peace, as it were.
[01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:32.200]  No, no, no. He's done that three times behind the scenes.
[01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:37.200]  And he now confirmed what he told me personally years ago on Hannity last week that he gave them shots,
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:40.200]  asked them to stop it, and then they just won't stop.
[01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:42.200]  Yeah. And that's what he needs to do.
[01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:45.200]  He needs to bring the full court press against them now.
[01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:49.200]  He needs to bring it to the light of day.
[01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:58.200]  Part of his mandate is to show the American people the ones that aren't directly tied in like your listeners are and other people.
[01:53:58.200 --> 01:54:01.200]  Sir, I agree with you, but do you understand what that means?
[01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:04.200]  You understand the deep state might set a nuke off in D.C.?
[01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:08.200]  I'm just saying, if Trump starts moving against him, which he looks like he's about to do,
[01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:14.200]  you understand you could wake up, sir, with, I mean, there is nothing they won't do.
[01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:18.200]  Well, they're going to do it anyway, so we might as well bring it to a head at this point.
[01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:21.200]  No, listen, I agree with you. I think let's just get this over with.
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:27.200]  Exactly. And one more thing, I would like to see him reform the Department of Education
[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:32.200]  or get rid of it all together because they are indoctrinating our children.
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:35.200]  Oh, yeah. The federal government has nothing to do with education.
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:39.200]  If the federal government wanted to put out patriotic civics and then it would be adopted by the states, that's fine.
[01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:45.200]  But right now, the federal education is a bunch of anti-American demoralization chai-com written filth.
[01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:47.200]  Absolutely. Thank you, Alex.
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:52.200]  Absolutely. God bless you. I don't care if the feds are involved in education if the states adopt it.
[01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:54.200]  But you don't do that with federal money coming in.
[01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:56.200]  That's if the states want to do it, they can do it.
[01:54:56.200 --> 01:55:00.200]  Or we could have contests and adopt different parts of state stuff at a federal level.
[01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:04.200]  We don't need centralization. We need decentralization.
[01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:07.200]  I'm getting angry. Let's talk to Lacey in Florida.
[01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:10.200]  Lacey, you're on the air. Go ahead. Thanks for holding.
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:17.200]  I am so excited to talk to you. First, I want to tell you President Trump is blowing me away with how smart he is.
[01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:21.200]  I'm an impatient person. I was ready for indictment a year ago.
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:26.200]  But what I really want to say is he waited. He did the right thing. He let Mueller do his thing.
[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:31.200]  He knew he never did anything wrong. And he knew if he didn't wait, they would use it against him.
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:33.200]  They would say that he was going after the other side.
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:39.200]  Sure. And then he collected all the evidence of their crimes, which he's got a full royal house in his hand.
[01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:42.200]  They don't even have any cards other than anarchy.
[01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:47.200]  But I agree. But see, why aren't they giving up now then? They never give up.
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:51.200]  They won't give up. And they're only going to continue to push it harder.
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:56.200]  They expect Trump to cave. And they're wrong about that. They're so wrong about that.
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:56:00.200]  And he's got now the Office of the Inspector General working on it.
[01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:03.200]  Huber, Huber, whatever his name is, he's working on it as well.
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:08.200]  The FISA abuse is going to be well documented. And all the evidence is on our side.
[01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:13.200]  But the media and the Democrats, they're still playing the propaganda game.
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:16.200]  And they're pushing it with everything they have. They're not going to back off.
[01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:20.200]  No, I agree. It was very telling yesterday, whenever... Who's the lady from Hawaii?
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:22.200]  He was just flipping out, calling, borrowing his names.
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:25.200]  He just said the thing. He goes, is it really come to this?
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:30.200]  And he just looked at the Democrats like, he's in there protecting them because they don't want a civil war.
[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:35.200]  He's in that damn report, covers up their crimes. And he's just like, what is your problem, you idiots?
[01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:38.200]  I mean, they're just morons.
[01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:45.200]  They are literally saying that their propaganda will work and it's not, it's not holding on to anyone
[01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:50.200]  except for the people that are already completely blinded by it, that have been on team Hillary the whole time.
[01:56:50.200 --> 01:56:53.200]  It's going to fall back on them. It's going to be pushed back on them.
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:58.200]  And I think that President Trump is ready to finally start the push, bring the indictment.
[01:56:58.200 --> 01:57:02.200]  We're ready. We're ready. We're tired of waiting.
[01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:07.200]  We're going to come back with Maisie Bird-Haranhoe when we come back, but great points and God bless you, Lacey.
[01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:12.200]  All I know is everybody better be praying right now to God for providence and for peace.
[01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:17.200]  In Venezuela, in the Middle East here, the world is going into a crisis point.
[01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:20.200]  And people are showing you who's good and who's evil. It's an amazing guy to be here.
[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:23.200]  Thank God we're on the air. We're only on the air because of you listeners.
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:26.200]  And I mean that. People call and say, oh, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:31.200]  Thanks for listening. Thanks for supporting. You understand, right?
[01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:33.200]  Like, we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:36.200]  They're trying to kill me, basically destroy me right now.
[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:38.200]  I always love the audience. Well, I really love you now.
[01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:41.200]  You're like a life raft in the middle of the North Atlantic.
[01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:46.200]  Don't call up thanking me. Just pray for the broadcast and spread the word. We'll be right back.

[02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:30.200]  Rip Van Winkle's a lot better looking than when I read about books.
[02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:34.200]  Leigh Ann McAdoo is back, like, this is like 10 years younger.
[02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:37.200]  She looks like when I first met her. She didn't look bad before, but she just, like,
[02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:40.200]  got in a magic time machine, went back in time.
[02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:44.200]  She's going to be in studio with us. She's been forest bathing for a year.
[02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:47.200]  She deserves it. So we'll get her take on things in studio.
[02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:50.200]  Continue with your calls, a bunch of news. We're taking your calls right now.
[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:53.200]  Deplorable Hill. That's interesting.
[02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:58.200]  Noam DePlume in Nevada. You're on the air. Thanks for calling.
[02:00:58.200 --> 02:01:01.200]  Good to talk to you, Alex. Welcome, sir.
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:04.200]  President Trump needs to move against the deep state.
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:06.200]  He needs to make an example out of somebody.
[02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:10.200]  I think Brennan would fit the bill there.
[02:01:10.200 --> 02:01:14.200]  Somebody needs a citizen's arrest, Hillary Clinton.
[02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:17.200]  Somebody needs to move against her, of course, legally.
[02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:20.200]  Why do you think she's so arrogant, saying,
[02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:23.200]  China, come help us defeat Trump, and Trump needs to be arrested,
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:25.200]  and Pelosi says Bar needs to be arrested?
[02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:28.200]  I mean, they've committed all these crimes nakedly,
[02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:33.200]  and they're still just so arrogant. They're losing on every front.
[02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:37.200]  I think it's because they think that they still have control.
[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:40.200]  They still think that the state-behind networks that Obama put in
[02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:44.200]  are still running a show, and they just, they're arrogant, full of hubris.
[02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:46.200]  That's just what they are.
[02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:49.200]  I agree with you. Where do you think this is going?
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:51.200]  It's not going anywhere we want to go.
[02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:55.200]  It's headed to a civil war if we don't move pretty swiftly.
[02:01:55.200 --> 02:01:57.200]  I think that's what we need to do.
[02:01:57.200 --> 02:02:00.200]  We need to make an example out of somebody legally, of course.
[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:03.200]  Exactly, and we're not going to start a physical fight,
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:06.200]  but what do they activate? The ANTIV or the MS-13 that's admittedly going to
[02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:10.200]  kill a bunch of police chiefs or try, kill a bunch of members of Congress,
[02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:12.200]  and then stage some events to blame it on us.
[02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:16.200]  I think you're going to see very smart people that are already in place
[02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:21.200]  go into motion and probably catch these guys in the act while they try it.
[02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:24.200]  Well, first of all, you don't want to piss off the Patriots in the United States of America.
[02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:26.200]  That's for one thing.
[02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:30.200]  Yes, we do need these individuals to go after the beef state.
[02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:32.200]  We need to lock them up.
[02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:34.200]  Well, I just know these people are a joke.
[02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:36.200]  And again, this is an incredible time to be alive.
[02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:38.200]  Thank you so much, Deplorable Hill.
[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:42.200]  Okay, next up, let's talk to Tracy in Georgia.
[02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:44.200]  Tracy, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:46.200]  We're going to pass for Sam.
[02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:48.200]  Hey, how are you doing, Mr. Jones?
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:50.200]  I'm good. Thanks for calling.
[02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:53.200]  Hey, real quick, I have to agree with you.
[02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:56.200]  I believe we're already on the way to a civil war.
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:03:01.200]  Right now it's cold, but I feel as though it's announced that Obama had anything to do
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:04.200]  with anything that's been going on with the Russians.
[02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:07.200]  That's what's going to turn it into a hot civil war,
[02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:11.200]  because the way the mainstream media is whipping everybody up right now,
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:13.200]  you know, their number one word is racist.
[02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:19.200]  What way to show that President Trump is racist by him inviting Obama?
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:24.200]  Well, that's it, because it was Hillary and Obama that gave the order to the illegal spying.
[02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:25.200]  It does lead back to them.
[02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:27.200]  And that's why Clapper and Brennan went out a month ago and said,
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:30.200]  hey, we were ordered to buy Obama, and I agree that when it leads to that,
[02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:33.200]  they're going to try to trigger some type of race war.
[02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:39.200]  But the left hasn't been successful getting that race war started so far.
[02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:43.200]  Right, right, but that's what's leading.
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:47.200]  They haven't been successful because it hasn't been the right trigger.
[02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:51.200]  Everything else, everybody else can downplay what's been going on.
[02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:53.200]  It can go in one ear and out the other.
[02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:58.200]  But if the beloved ex-President is named when no one believes in it,
[02:03:58.200 --> 02:04:01.200]  no one believes that he will do anything like this,
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:04.200]  that's the difference maker.
[02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:05.200]  No, I agree.
[02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:06.200]  That's the race in the hole.
[02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:07.200]  You said it.
[02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:10.200]  It's because they've got Obama, a former president,
[02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:12.200]  and going after a former president, period, it's a big deal.
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:15.200]  And the first black president, they will be able to spin that,
[02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:17.200]  that it's being done because they're racist.
[02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:20.200]  And so I think that's why Obama still moved into D.C.
[02:04:20.200 --> 02:04:23.200]  He's kind of running the show still, running the shadow government.
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:25.200]  I think you just, I think you hit the nail on the head.
[02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:26.200]  Sure.
[02:04:26.200 --> 02:04:29.200]  And that's why Jesse Smollett is able to do what he does.
[02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:32.200]  This is why Kim Fox may not have anything done to her,
[02:04:32.200 --> 02:04:36.200]  even though the city of Chicago has requested her to come.
[02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:38.200]  You know, we got Leigh Ann coming up, Tracy,
[02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:40.200]  but if you can hold a little bit longer, I want to come back,
[02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:41.200]  because you're really, you hit it.
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:42.200]  I was looking for the answer.
[02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:43.200]  That's it.
[02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:44.200]  Tracy answered the question.
[02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:47.200]  If you can stay fine, if not, you got to go understand.
[02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:48.200]  Leigh Ann's coming in, more calls straight ahead,
[02:04:48.200 --> 02:04:50.200]  but we're going to host the fourth hour with her as well.
[02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:52.200]  So get strapped in, folks.
[02:04:56.200 --> 02:04:59.200]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen
[02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:01.200]  and pump the environment full of the bad halogens,
[02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:03.200]  fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it,
[02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:05.200]  that it lowers IQ.
[02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:08.200]  It literally dumps the population down.
[02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:10.200]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers
[02:05:10.200 --> 02:05:14.200]  the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[02:05:14.200 --> 02:05:17.200]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good,
[02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:19.200]  but hard to source, and the globalists tried to block us
[02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:21.200]  getting a supply of it.
[02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:24.200]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine
[02:05:24.200 --> 02:05:27.200]  and RotUX2, that's been incredible.
[02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:29.200]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that,
[02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:33.200]  we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals
[02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:34.200]  of nascent iodine.
[02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:37.200]  But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research
[02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:40.200]  that by combining it with three other compounds,
[02:05:40.200 --> 02:05:43.200]  two forms of iodine and vitamin C,
[02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:48.200]  it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[02:05:48.200 --> 02:05:50.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it,
[02:05:50.200 --> 02:05:52.200]  you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[02:05:52.200 --> 02:06:14.200]  X3, now available at enforcelife.com.
[02:06:14.200 --> 02:06:22.200]  And with that, you have demonstrated sufficient impartiality
[02:06:22.200 --> 02:06:26.200]  to continue to oversee the 14 other criminal matters
[02:06:26.200 --> 02:06:29.200]  that the Special Counsel referred to in other parts,
[02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:32.200]  to other parts of the Department of Justice.
[02:06:32.200 --> 02:06:36.200]  But now, we know more about your deep involvement
[02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:38.200]  in trying to cover up for Donald Trump.
[02:06:38.200 --> 02:06:41.200]  Being Attorney General of the United States is a sacred trust.
[02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:45.200]  You have betrayed that trust America deserves better.
[02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:47.200]  You should resign.
[02:06:47.200 --> 02:06:49.200]  I have some questions for you.
[02:06:49.200 --> 02:06:52.200]  Is the White House exerting any influence on your decision
[02:06:52.200 --> 02:06:54.200]  whether to allow Special Counsel Mueller
[02:06:54.200 --> 02:06:57.200]  to testify in Congress and when?
[02:06:57.200 --> 02:06:59.200]  No.
[02:06:59.200 --> 02:07:01.200]  Now, you've been clear today that you don't think
[02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:05.200]  that any of the 10 episodes of possible obstruction
[02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:08.200]  that the Special Counsel outlined is a crime.
[02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:13.200]  I disagree, but you seem to think that if it's not a crime,
[02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:17.200]  then there's no problem, nothing to see here,
[02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:19.200]  nothing to worry about.
[02:07:19.200 --> 02:07:22.200]  So, with apologies to Adam Schiff,
[02:07:22.200 --> 02:07:26.200]  do you think all of the things that President Trump did are okay?
[02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:29.200]  Are they what the President of the United States should be doing?
[02:07:29.200 --> 02:07:32.200]  For example, do you think it's okay for a president
[02:07:32.200 --> 02:07:36.200]  to fire an FBI director to stop him from investigating links
[02:07:36.200 --> 02:07:39.200]  between his campaign and Russia?
[02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:42.200]  It may not be a crime, but do you think it's okay?
[02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:45.200]  Well, I think the report is clear that...
[02:07:45.200 --> 02:07:48.200]  No, I'm not talking about the report and its analysis
[02:07:48.200 --> 02:07:50.200]  of whether a crime occurred. I'm asking you.
[02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:53.200]  This is not a crime, but do you think it's okay for the President
[02:07:53.200 --> 02:07:56.200]  to do what he did, to fire the Special Counsel,
[02:07:56.200 --> 02:07:58.200]  to keep them from investigating?
[02:07:58.200 --> 02:08:00.200]  I do think it's okay for the President to do what he did,
[02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:02.200]  and I don't think the evidence supports the proposition.
[02:08:02.200 --> 02:08:04.200]  So, I guess you think it's okay to stop the investigation.
[02:08:04.200 --> 02:08:06.200]  Do you think it's okay for a president to ask
[02:08:06.200 --> 02:08:10.200]  his White House counsel to lie?
[02:08:10.200 --> 02:08:14.200]  Well, I'm willing to talk about what's criminal.
[02:08:14.200 --> 02:08:17.200]  No, we've already acknowledged that you think it was not a crime.
[02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:19.200]  I'm just asking whether you think it's okay.
[02:08:19.200 --> 02:08:22.200]  Even if it's not a crime, do you think it's okay
[02:08:22.200 --> 02:08:27.200]  for the President to ask his White House counsel to lie?
[02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:28.200]  Which...
[02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:30.200]  Look, if you're just going to go back to whether or not it's a crime,
[02:08:30.200 --> 02:08:32.200]  you're telling me that it's okay.
[02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:35.200]  The last question that I have in 17 seconds.
[02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:38.200]  Do you think it's okay for a president to offer pardons to people
[02:08:38.200 --> 02:08:40.200]  who don't testify against him,
[02:08:40.200 --> 02:08:45.200]  to threaten the family of someone who does?
[02:08:45.200 --> 02:08:49.200]  Is that okay?
[02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:52.200]  When did he offer a pardon to someone in order to...
[02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:54.200]  I think you know what I'm talking about.
[02:08:54.200 --> 02:08:57.200]  Please, Mr. Attorney General,
[02:08:57.200 --> 02:09:00.200]  give us some credit for knowing what the hell is going on around here with you.
[02:09:00.200 --> 02:09:03.200]  Not really.
[02:09:03.200 --> 02:09:05.200]  To this liner questioning.
[02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:07.200]  Listen, you slandered this man.
[02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:11.200]  What I sort of want to know is how do we get to this point?
[02:09:11.200 --> 02:09:14.200]  I do not think that I slandered anyone.
[02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:18.200]  Mr. Chairman, I am done. Thank you very much.
[02:09:18.200 --> 02:09:22.200]  You slandered this man from top to bottom.
[02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:25.200]  So if you want more of this, you're not going to get it.
[02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:28.200]  If you want to ask him questions, you can't.
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:33.200]  I think this hearing today has been quite revealing to anyone watching it,
[02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:38.200]  although perhaps not for the reason some of the Democratic senators intended.
[02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:43.200]  One thing that's revealing in the discussion and questions that came up,
[02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:48.200]  a word that occurred almost none at all is the word Russia.
[02:09:48.200 --> 02:09:55.200]  For two and a half years we heard Democratic senators going on and on and on about Russia collusion.
[02:09:55.200 --> 02:10:02.200]  We heard journalists going on and on and on about Russia collusion,
[02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:08.200]  alleging, among other things, some using extreme rhetoric calling the president a traitor.
[02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:11.200]  We heard very little of that in this hearing today.
[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:18.200]  Instead, the principal attack that Democratic senators have marshaled upon you
[02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:25.200]  concerns this March 27th letter from Robert Mueller,
[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:29.200]  and it's an attack that I want people to understand just how revealing it is.
[02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:33.200]  If this is their whole argument, they ain't got nothing.
[02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:40.200]  So their argument is as follows. Let me see if I understand it correctly.
[02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:42.200]  You initially, when you received the Mueller report,
[02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:48.200]  released to Congress and the public a four-page summary of the conclusions.
[02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:54.200]  Then on March 27th, Mr. Mueller asked you to release an additional 19 pages,
[02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:59.200]  the introduction and summary that he had drafted.
[02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:01.200]  And indeed, in the letter what he says is,
[02:11:01.200 --> 02:11:04.200]  quote, I am requesting that you provide these materials to Congress
[02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:08.200]  and authorize their public release at this time.
[02:11:08.200 --> 02:11:14.200]  And the reason he says it is to fully capture the context, nature,
[02:11:14.200 --> 02:11:17.200]  and substance of the office's work and conclusion.
[02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:20.200]  So you did not release those 19 pages at that time.
[02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:27.200]  Instead, a couple of weeks later, you released 448 pages,
[02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:32.200]  the entire report, which includes those 19 pages.
[02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:34.200]  Do I have that timeline correct?
[02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:35.200]  That's right.
[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:40.200]  So their entire argument is, General Barr,
[02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:46.200]  you suppressed the 19 pages that are entirely public,
[02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:50.200]  that we have, that we can read, that they know every word of it.
[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:54.200]  And their complaint is it was delayed a few weeks.
[02:11:54.200 --> 02:11:58.200]  And that was because of your decision not to release the report piecemeal,
[02:11:58.200 --> 02:12:03.200]  but rather to release those 19 pages with the entire 448 pages
[02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:05.200]  produced by the special counsel.
[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:06.200]  Yes.
[02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:12.200]  If that is their argument,
[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:16.200]  I have to say that is an exceptionally weak argument.
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:18.200]  Because if you're hiding something,
[02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:20.200]  I'll tell you right now, General Barr,
[02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:22.200]  you're doing a very lousy job of hiding it.
[02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:24.200]  Because the thing that they're suggesting you hid,
[02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:27.200]  you released to Congress and the American people.
[02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:30.200]  And so if anyone wants to know what's in those 19 pages
[02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:33.200]  that are being so breathlessly,
[02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:35.200]  oh, Bob Mueller said release the 19 pages.
[02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:36.200]  You did.
[02:12:36.200 --> 02:12:37.200]  You did it a couple of weeks later.
[02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:40.200]  But we can read every word of the 19 pages
[02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:44.200]  along with the full report.
[02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:47.200]  And your judgment was the Mueller report thorough.
[02:12:47.200 --> 02:12:48.200]  Yes.
[02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:53.200]  Did they expand enormous time, energy and resources
[02:12:53.200 --> 02:12:59.200]  investigating and producing them?
[02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:02.200]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation,
[02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:05.200]  it's Alex Jones coming to you live
[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:09.200]  from the front lines of the Info War.
[02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:11.200]  OK, I'm going to wait to comment on this
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:13.200]  to the start of the fourth hour.
[02:13:13.200 --> 02:13:16.200]  Maybe we can send Drudge an email.
[02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:20.200]  Sometimes when I tell him to specifically comment on something,
[02:13:20.200 --> 02:13:23.200]  he's nice enough to give us that additional forum
[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:26.200]  to communicate with the press and the president and the public.
[02:13:26.200 --> 02:13:32.200]  Because Drudge is the water cooler of the planet.
[02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:34.200]  There was always a hoax that we were completely banned
[02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:36.200]  on Facebook and YouTube and all these places.
[02:13:36.200 --> 02:13:39.200]  Apple did say completely off our platforms, including the app.
[02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:42.200]  They claimed false strikes on our YouTube
[02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:45.200]  and false strikes on Facebook.
[02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:47.200]  They said, I beat up a 10-year-old kid
[02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:49.200]  and then he just showed some ABC news footage
[02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:52.200]  of another guy in another city with a kid attacking him
[02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:55.200]  and the guy pushes the kid back down.
[02:13:55.200 --> 02:13:58.200]  And then even when Jack Dorsey was on Joe Rogan
[02:13:58.200 --> 02:14:00.200]  a few months ago, they said, why is Alex Jones banned?
[02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:02.200]  He goes, well, he child endangerment.
[02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:04.200]  He beat up a small child.
[02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:06.200]  It's just, I mean, it's insane.
[02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:08.200]  Well, but I kept explaining it, but that's only those pages.
[02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:13.200]  Well, Oliver Darcy, the literal rat-like creature
[02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:15.200]  that slithers around policing
[02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:18.200]  and harassing conservative sponsors,
[02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:21.200]  in coordination, they banned Lewis Faircon
[02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:23.200]  so they can then go any semide
[02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:25.200]  and say all that and mix my name in with it.
[02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:27.200]  Milo Yiannopoulos in M4 Wars,
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:31.200]  my personal page that we didn't really update
[02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:33.200]  but it was our personal page
[02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:35.200]  and a bunch of old pages associated with films
[02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:38.200]  like Endgame and Terrorstorm
[02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:41.200]  and others from its platform as dangerous.
[02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:43.200]  So the new thing is they're calling things false news,
[02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:46.200]  not fake news, and they're calling it dangerous
[02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:47.200]  and they slander me.
[02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:48.200]  No email came in.
[02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:49.200]  They just have locked the pages down.
[02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:50.200]  They don't tell me what I did.
[02:14:50.200 --> 02:14:51.200]  They just say I'm dangerous
[02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:53.200]  and then talk about anti-Semitism.
[02:14:53.200 --> 02:14:55.200]  So this is what's going on.
[02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:57.200]  They also warned us they may ban the pages this week
[02:14:57.200 --> 02:14:59.200]  because we said the measles outbreak
[02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:00.200]  is coming from illegal aliens
[02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:02.200]  and showed an ABC News report.
[02:15:02.200 --> 02:15:04.200]  Maybe we can document cam shot that.
[02:15:04.200 --> 02:15:06.200]  So I'm not going to get to this till next hour.
[02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:08.200]  I want to talk to Leigh Ann.
[02:15:08.200 --> 02:15:11.200]  I want to take, you know, phone calls.
[02:15:11.200 --> 02:15:12.200]  We're going to go into the fourth hour.
[02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:14.200]  Leigh Ann, it's so good to have her here.
[02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:15.200]  We'll get into this.
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:17.200]  But they already have a shadow ban on these pages
[02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:19.200]  so it doesn't really even matter.
[02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:21.200]  People can go to those pages themselves
[02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:22.200]  and see materials.
[02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:24.200]  So it has some effect, but, you know,
[02:15:24.200 --> 02:15:26.200]  it's kind of coming to fire hose
[02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:28.200]  and then dialing it back to a pixie straw.
[02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:30.200]  That's why you've got to point out to folks
[02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:32.200]  infowars.com, newswars.com,
[02:15:32.200 --> 02:15:33.200]  tomorrow's news today.
[02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:34.200]  That's how you find us
[02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:36.200]  and they're trying to take our servers away there
[02:15:36.200 --> 02:15:37.200]  and shut us down.
[02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:38.200]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:41.200]  The beautiful Rip Van Winkle is here.
[02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:43.200]  We'll explain how that she's Rip Van Winkle
[02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:44.200]  when we come back.
[02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:46.200]  Sweet Leigh Ann McAdess,
[02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:48.200]  smart Leigh Ann McAdess.
[02:15:48.200 --> 02:15:50.200]  When we come back, she has returned.
[02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:52.200]  The prodigal daughter.
[02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:53.200]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:53.200 --> 02:16:22.200]  Stay with us tomorrow's news today.
[02:16:23.200 --> 02:16:24.200]  We'll be right back.
[02:16:54.200 --> 02:16:55.200]  Hello, patriots.
[02:16:55.200 --> 02:16:57.200]  My name is Todd Savage,
[02:16:57.200 --> 02:16:59.200]  founder of Black Rifle Real Estate.com.
[02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:01.200]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the
[02:17:01.200 --> 02:17:02.200]  Outleft Sanctuary State
[02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:05.200]  until one day I chose to lead my family to freedom.
[02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:07.200]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead
[02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:09.200]  where we shoot, hunt, garden,
[02:17:09.200 --> 02:17:10.200]  and homeschool our children
[02:17:10.200 --> 02:17:13.200]  without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.
[02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:14.200]  If you're ready to flee the city
[02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:16.200]  to the freedom of Idaho or Montana,
[02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:18.200]  our Black Rifle Real Estate team is here to help.

[02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:24.200]  The United States of Empire
[02:17:24.200 --> 02:17:26.200]  is a book that claims the United States
[02:17:26.200 --> 02:17:28.200]  is the empire of the world.
[02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:30.200]  George Washington had warned us against
[02:17:30.200 --> 02:17:31.200]  foreign wars.
[02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:33.200]  The United States of Empire
[02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:35.200]  shows that World Wars I and II
[02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:37.200]  left England broken.
[02:17:37.200 --> 02:17:39.200]  Its former colony, the U.S.,
[02:17:39.200 --> 02:17:41.200]  had to save the empire.
[02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:42.200]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:42.200 --> 02:17:43.200]  Who do we fight for?
[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:46.200]  The deep state began with World War I.
[02:17:46.200 --> 02:17:48.200]  The United States of Empire
[02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:50.200]  by James Dunn.
[02:17:50.200 --> 02:17:52.200]  Available at Amazon Books.
[02:17:54.200 --> 02:17:55.200]  As the years go by,
[02:17:55.200 --> 02:17:56.200]  it gets harder and harder
[02:17:56.200 --> 02:17:59.200]  to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[02:17:59.200 --> 02:18:02.200]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress,
[02:18:02.200 --> 02:18:05.200]  you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients,
[02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:08.200]  amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:10.200]  That's why InfaWars Life
[02:18:10.200 --> 02:18:13.200]  created the powerful vitamin mineral fusion formula,

[02:20:29.200 --> 02:20:32.200]  Live from the InfaWars.com studios,

[02:20:34.200 --> 02:20:36.200]  Well, the deep state is striking back,
[02:20:36.200 --> 02:20:38.200]  striking back big time on the reserve comment
[02:20:38.200 --> 02:20:40.200]  until the next hour.
[02:20:40.200 --> 02:20:42.200]  But they say I've been banned for being dangerous
[02:20:42.200 --> 02:20:44.200]  and anti-semitic from Facebook
[02:20:44.200 --> 02:20:47.200]  and I will, quote, be purged.
[02:20:47.200 --> 02:20:49.200]  Purged!
[02:20:49.200 --> 02:20:51.200]  There's one thing to take me off your platform.
[02:20:51.200 --> 02:20:53.200]  There's another thing to make crap up
[02:20:53.200 --> 02:20:57.200]  and then the de-platforming is this defamation.
[02:20:57.200 --> 02:21:00.200]  So, we're going to get into all the calls
[02:21:00.200 --> 02:21:02.200]  that Leigh Ann Maccabean is.
[02:21:02.200 --> 02:21:04.200]  She's in the host with us in the next hour.
[02:21:04.200 --> 02:21:06.200]  Leigh Ann, it is so good to see you.
[02:21:06.200 --> 02:21:09.200]  And I guess you started working here like nine years ago.
[02:21:09.200 --> 02:21:11.200]  You've been gone taking care of your grandma
[02:21:11.200 --> 02:21:13.200]  about a year and a half ago.
[02:21:13.200 --> 02:21:15.200]  You took some other time off.
[02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:17.200]  I want to know, Ponce de Leon,
[02:21:17.200 --> 02:21:19.200]  I know you live in Florida part of the time,
[02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:21.200]  but you have found the fountain of youth
[02:21:21.200 --> 02:21:24.200]  because you look almost as young as when I first met you,
[02:21:24.200 --> 02:21:26.200]  like dial back six, seven, eight years.
[02:21:26.200 --> 02:21:28.200]  What's happening here?
[02:21:28.200 --> 02:21:30.200]  Yeah, you know what?
[02:21:30.200 --> 02:21:32.200]  This is what shutting off social media
[02:21:32.200 --> 02:21:35.200]  and the news and all the cacophony of voices out there
[02:21:35.200 --> 02:21:37.200]  will do to you.
[02:21:37.200 --> 02:21:39.200]  It gives you your life back, your energy,
[02:21:39.200 --> 02:21:41.200]  and you know, it was a really tough year,
[02:21:41.200 --> 02:21:43.200]  last year, 2018.
[02:21:43.200 --> 02:21:45.200]  So, a lot of personal things going on.
[02:21:45.200 --> 02:21:48.200]  And I just took a mental health break
[02:21:48.200 --> 02:21:51.200]  and like turning off social media was a huge part of that
[02:21:51.200 --> 02:21:56.200]  and just being, taking forest bathing to a whole new degree
[02:21:56.200 --> 02:21:58.200]  with just living out in the woods in Topanga,
[02:21:58.200 --> 02:22:01.200]  climbing the mountains, going up in caves,
[02:22:01.200 --> 02:22:04.200]  and you know, needed four-wheel drive.
[02:22:04.200 --> 02:22:06.200]  It's amazing.
[02:22:06.200 --> 02:22:08.200]  What is this website?
[02:22:08.200 --> 02:22:10.200]  Oh, that's just, it hasn't been updated,
[02:22:10.200 --> 02:22:12.200]  but that's leighannmackadoo.com.
[02:22:12.200 --> 02:22:14.200]  You want to follow me there?
[02:22:14.200 --> 02:22:16.200]  We have a long relationship.
[02:22:16.200 --> 02:22:18.200]  Apparently, I've been pregnant for like eight years.
[02:22:18.200 --> 02:22:21.200]  You know, you've been friends with my wife
[02:22:21.200 --> 02:22:23.200]  and all the rest of it, but I tell you,
[02:22:23.200 --> 02:22:25.200]  I'm not that exciting.
[02:22:25.200 --> 02:22:29.200]  Yeah, the rumors are much more scandalous
[02:22:29.200 --> 02:22:31.200]  than life actually is.
[02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:33.200]  You know, tell me about Ifor.
[02:22:33.200 --> 02:22:35.200]  Ifor's just a bunch of work, isn't it?
[02:22:35.200 --> 02:22:37.200]  Yeah.
[02:22:37.200 --> 02:22:39.200]  We're in the Millennium Falcon getting attacked here.
[02:22:39.200 --> 02:22:42.200]  Yeah, and it's just, it's incredible
[02:22:42.200 --> 02:22:45.200]  to just see the house swiftly.
[02:22:45.200 --> 02:22:47.200]  They kind of brought the hammer down
[02:22:47.200 --> 02:22:49.200]  and shut everything down, and really,
[02:22:49.200 --> 02:22:53.200]  you know, you could have gone on for 20, 30 more years
[02:22:53.200 --> 02:22:54.200]  and done your show.
[02:22:54.200 --> 02:22:55.200]  They wouldn't have cared.
[02:22:55.200 --> 02:22:56.200]  They wouldn't have touched you,
[02:22:56.200 --> 02:22:59.200]  but the fact that InfoWars played such a pivotal role
[02:22:59.200 --> 02:23:03.200]  in the 2016 election, and they started to really go,
[02:23:03.200 --> 02:23:06.200]  wow, okay, they're dangerous
[02:23:06.200 --> 02:23:09.200]  because they're actually turning on people's minds
[02:23:09.200 --> 02:23:12.200]  and giving them different information
[02:23:12.200 --> 02:23:15.200]  than the media has been able to control
[02:23:15.200 --> 02:23:18.200]  all the information streams all of these years,
[02:23:18.200 --> 02:23:20.200]  and of course, with the Internet,
[02:23:20.200 --> 02:23:22.200]  too many people are waking up too fast
[02:23:22.200 --> 02:23:24.200]  to the fact that they are being programmed
[02:23:24.200 --> 02:23:29.200]  and propaganda onslaught from the mainstream media sources.
[02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:32.200]  So, of course, before this next big election coming up,
[02:23:32.200 --> 02:23:34.200]  they've got to shut down all those voices
[02:23:34.200 --> 02:23:37.200]  that cost them the election in 2016.
[02:23:37.200 --> 02:23:39.200]  And I love how they'll go to Congress and say,
[02:23:39.200 --> 02:23:41.200]  we've never censored anybody or anything,
[02:23:41.200 --> 02:23:43.200]  and then they'll just systematically go,
[02:23:43.200 --> 02:23:45.200]  we're going to ban everybody that got Trump elected,
[02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:48.200]  and then they lie why they ban you when they do it.
[02:23:48.200 --> 02:23:49.200]  That's the defamation line.
[02:23:49.200 --> 02:23:51.200]  Okay, Facebook, you're going to ban me.
[02:23:51.200 --> 02:23:55.200]  Why do you say dangerous and anti-semitic?
[02:23:55.200 --> 02:23:57.200]  You know, it's not true.
[02:23:57.200 --> 02:23:59.200]  You're just lying jerks, man.
[02:23:59.200 --> 02:24:04.200]  I can say, you know, just being out of clown world
[02:24:04.200 --> 02:24:09.200]  for the last year, just talking to people kind of one-on-one,
[02:24:09.200 --> 02:24:12.200]  a lot of it is that once they label you as racist
[02:24:12.200 --> 02:24:14.200]  or anti-semitic or this or that,
[02:24:14.200 --> 02:24:17.200]  it's almost like how Communist China,
[02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:21.200]  they have the social score.
[02:24:21.200 --> 02:24:24.200]  They make it to where now your friends
[02:24:24.200 --> 02:24:27.200]  or your true fans, they're embarrassed to say
[02:24:27.200 --> 02:24:29.200]  that they follow you or this or that,
[02:24:29.200 --> 02:24:31.200]  because, oh, now I'm going to be associated
[02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:33.200]  with this anti-Semite or whatever,
[02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:34.200]  even if it's not true,
[02:24:34.200 --> 02:24:36.200]  but now that you've been labeled as that.
[02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:38.200]  Yeah, they give into the peer pressure,
[02:24:38.200 --> 02:24:40.200]  and then now it gives the bullies more power.
[02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:41.200]  Exactly.
[02:24:41.200 --> 02:24:44.200]  And that's what it is, is there's almost a timidity
[02:24:44.200 --> 02:24:46.200]  with people where they're like,
[02:24:46.200 --> 02:24:48.200]  oh, yeah, I love Alex.
[02:24:48.200 --> 02:24:49.200]  You know, I watch it, you know,
[02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:53.200]  because it's like they're seeing this tyranny
[02:24:53.200 --> 02:24:55.200]  kind of come down and cut people's channels off.
[02:24:55.200 --> 02:24:56.200]  And I know mixture media lies,
[02:24:56.200 --> 02:24:57.200]  but literally most people talk to go,
[02:24:57.200 --> 02:24:59.200]  I used to love you when you were on air.
[02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:00.200]  I wish you were still on air.
[02:25:00.200 --> 02:25:02.200]  And I'm like, you know that media lies,
[02:25:02.200 --> 02:25:03.200]  it's bigger.
[02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:05.200]  We have video on our own audio, you do?
[02:25:05.200 --> 02:25:07.200]  Yeah, oh, I know your site's there,
[02:25:07.200 --> 02:25:10.200]  but it's like the media said he's gone.
[02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:12.200]  And they go, he is gone, he is gone.
[02:25:12.200 --> 02:25:15.200]  Again, it's just, again,
[02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:17.200]  they could have gotten rid of these other pages
[02:25:17.200 --> 02:25:19.200]  a long time ago.
[02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:21.200]  They chose to dole this out.
[02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:23.200]  Right, so it keeps it in the news cycle,
[02:25:23.200 --> 02:25:25.200]  how you're bad, and then they can wrap you up
[02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:29.200]  with whoever the new bad guy is,
[02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:30.200]  Lewis Farrakhan.
[02:25:30.200 --> 02:25:32.200]  Let's say this is about Lewis Farrakhan.
[02:25:32.200 --> 02:25:34.200]  Obviously, he's a big interview.
[02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:36.200]  He says a lot of things that I think make sense,
[02:25:36.200 --> 02:25:38.200]  like black communities shouldn't be dependent,
[02:25:38.200 --> 02:25:40.200]  they should have their own businesses, all that's great.
[02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:41.200]  He says some things I disagree with.
[02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:43.200]  I went and did a famous interview, so it was 60 minutes.
[02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:45.200]  And he had dinner with me and wanted to know
[02:25:45.200 --> 02:25:46.200]  I want to stop the race war,
[02:25:46.200 --> 02:25:48.200]  I want to figure out how to work with Trump
[02:25:48.200 --> 02:25:49.200]  to bring people together,
[02:25:49.200 --> 02:25:51.200]  but he goes, I don't know if my constituent's going to get that.
[02:25:51.200 --> 02:25:54.200]  He's tried to stop and like, you know,
[02:25:54.200 --> 02:25:57.200]  in your old age kind of transcend things.
[02:25:57.200 --> 02:25:59.200]  The media gave it zero coverage.
[02:25:59.200 --> 02:26:01.200]  There's Lewis Farrakhan saying,
[02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:03.200]  I want whites and blacks and everybody else to come together
[02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:05.200]  and Jews and Christians and Muslims,
[02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:06.200]  and it got no coverage.
[02:26:06.200 --> 02:26:09.200]  Well, it also got no coverage when President Obama
[02:26:09.200 --> 02:26:11.200]  was there eating dinner with him.
[02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:12.200]  You know, that got no coverage.
[02:26:12.200 --> 02:26:15.200]  They kept that picture from making the rounds on social media
[02:26:15.200 --> 02:26:18.200]  until well after he was out of office.
[02:26:18.200 --> 02:26:23.200]  Or the women's march,
[02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:25.200]  Linda Sarsour and these others,
[02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:27.200]  who they just put up on this pedestal and everyone's like,
[02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:31.200]  no, I agree, but I think David Duke, Lewis Farrakhan,
[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:33.200]  I mean, I'll say it, I've interviewed David Duke,
[02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:35.200]  I've talked to him, he's like a robot.
[02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:37.200]  Farrakhan has a lot of charm,
[02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:39.200]  and I think deep down means well,
[02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:41.200]  and you know, back when he started all this stuff,
[02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:42.200]  people were oppressing black folks,
[02:26:42.200 --> 02:26:44.200]  they had to have their own identity to stand up,
[02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:46.200]  but I think now he gets that it's a larger,
[02:26:46.200 --> 02:26:47.200]  he's being played now.
[02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:50.200]  With Duke, he's just playing the whole game.
[02:26:50.200 --> 02:26:51.200]  Right.
[02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:55.200]  Yeah, and obviously I don't agree with a lot of what these people say,
[02:26:55.200 --> 02:26:57.200]  but they have a right to a platform.
[02:26:57.200 --> 02:26:58.200]  Exactly, and that's it.
[02:26:58.200 --> 02:27:02.200]  It's like, I did see on Twitter that the big scandal
[02:27:02.200 --> 02:27:05.200]  was that Venezuela took CNN off the air,
[02:27:05.200 --> 02:27:06.200]  and that's terrible, that's bad,
[02:27:06.200 --> 02:27:09.200]  because the dictator is taking CNN off the air,
[02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:12.200]  but then meanwhile we've got like Oliver Darcy and others
[02:27:12.200 --> 02:27:15.200]  celebrating other people here in a country
[02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:17.200]  where we actually have free speech
[02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:20.200]  as part of our constitution,
[02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:22.200]  the right to free speech, free press.
[02:27:22.200 --> 02:27:24.200]  They're celebrating that being taken down.
[02:27:24.200 --> 02:27:27.200]  It's just like, it is clown world.
[02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:29.200]  I'm already feeling crazy again.
[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:32.200]  I want to make this interview about you
[02:27:32.200 --> 02:27:35.200]  and how much we miss you and how awesome you are,
[02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:38.200]  and to take calls and instead it's gonzo journalism.
[02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:40.200]  We're back in the news under attack again,
[02:27:40.200 --> 02:27:42.200]  and by the way folks, I'm not a victim of a target
[02:27:42.200 --> 02:27:44.200]  like Tommy Robinson says, but let me explain something.
[02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:46.200]  For everything you see on the surface,
[02:27:46.200 --> 02:27:48.200]  and Leigh Ann can attest to this,
[02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:49.200]  there's a lot going on behind the scenes.
[02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:51.200]  They played some dirty tricks on you too.
[02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:55.200]  Yeah, well that's why I just, you know,
[02:27:55.200 --> 02:27:57.200]  when Matt Drudge came here years ago
[02:27:57.200 --> 02:28:00.200]  and said to get out of these internet ghettos
[02:28:00.200 --> 02:28:01.200]  and to shut it down.
[02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:03.200]  I wish I had listened to him more than, I mean, I tried.
[02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:06.200]  Yeah, well I did.
[02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:07.200]  I mean, I've really...
[02:28:07.200 --> 02:28:09.200]  Well they admit it, manipulates your dopamine,
[02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:11.200]  social media is meant to make you depressed,
[02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:12.200]  and you say you're so happy now that you're out of it.
[02:28:12.200 --> 02:28:15.200]  Yeah, and I can't delete my accounts and everything
[02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:16.200]  because I've got to keep a record
[02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:19.200]  with this lawsuit that I'm involved in.
[02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:21.200]  You know, I can't delete.
[02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:23.200]  That's right, you got sued by the Vatican
[02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:26.200]  by Georgetown University that's funding it.
[02:28:26.200 --> 02:28:29.200]  Lying and saying you said that some dude killed a woman,
[02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:30.200]  you never said that.
[02:28:30.200 --> 02:28:31.200]  No, I nodded.
[02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:35.200]  I'm named in the lawsuit because I went.
[02:28:35.200 --> 02:28:36.200]  Which is, you know, what you do
[02:28:36.200 --> 02:28:38.200]  when you're looking into the camera.
[02:28:38.200 --> 02:28:39.200]  They're just terrorizing people.
[02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:44.200]  Yeah, it's just silencing any dissenting voices.
[02:28:44.200 --> 02:28:45.200]  Anyone might make an impact.
[02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:46.200]  You're awesome, and we're going to come back
[02:28:46.200 --> 02:28:48.200]  and take phone calls and get into a bunch of issues.
[02:28:48.200 --> 02:28:51.200]  And I just, it's so good to have you here.
[02:28:51.200 --> 02:28:52.200]  It's just, it's good.
[02:28:52.200 --> 02:28:55.200]  I mean, hell, we're here like seven, eight years, man.

[02:30:06.200 --> 02:30:08.200]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield,
[02:30:08.200 --> 02:30:11.200]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:30:11.200 --> 02:30:13.200]  It's made in the USA.
[02:30:13.200 --> 02:30:16.200]  It's filled with known compounds from nature
[02:30:16.200 --> 02:30:19.200]  that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[02:30:19.200 --> 02:30:20.200]  and it supports the info war.
[02:30:20.200 --> 02:30:22.200]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:30:22.200 --> 02:30:25.200]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking
[02:30:25.200 --> 02:30:27.200]  for over a year and now we believe
[02:30:27.200 --> 02:30:29.200]  we have come as close to perfection
[02:30:29.200 --> 02:30:32.200]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:30:32.200 --> 02:30:34.200]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family
[02:30:34.200 --> 02:30:37.200]  and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[02:30:37.200 --> 02:30:40.200]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused
[02:30:40.200 --> 02:30:44.200]  as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America,
[02:30:44.200 --> 02:30:46.200]  to reignite those brush fires to the next level
[02:30:46.200 --> 02:30:48.200]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:30:48.200 --> 02:30:50.200]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together,
[02:30:50.200 --> 02:30:52.200]  we're changing the world.
[02:30:52.200 --> 02:30:54.200]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield
[02:30:54.200 --> 02:30:56.200]  at infowarslife.com.
[02:30:56.200 --> 02:30:58.200]  Our grandparents and great grandparents
[02:30:58.200 --> 02:31:00.200]  knew that they canned food during the fall
[02:31:00.200 --> 02:31:02.200]  so they'd have it during the winter.
[02:31:02.200 --> 02:31:05.200]  And that's what I'm talking about at infowarstore.com.
[02:31:05.200 --> 02:31:08.200]  With info war select, it's the full spectrum
[02:31:08.200 --> 02:31:10.200]  of my patriots supply.
[02:31:10.200 --> 02:31:12.200]  One of the top most respected companies out there
[02:31:12.200 --> 02:31:14.200]  but because I private label it,
[02:31:14.200 --> 02:31:17.200]  I'm able to go below cost on contracts
[02:31:17.200 --> 02:31:20.200]  that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[02:31:20.200 --> 02:31:22.200]  But I want to be a market leader
[02:31:22.200 --> 02:31:24.200]  and I want you to have storeable food
[02:31:24.200 --> 02:31:26.200]  so it's a total win-win.
[02:31:26.200 --> 02:31:28.200]  We have those incredible sell prices back
[02:31:28.200 --> 02:31:30.200]  at infowarstore.com.
[02:31:30.200 --> 02:31:32.200]  On info war select, storeable foods,
[02:31:32.200 --> 02:31:34.200]  they've got special diet foods,
[02:31:34.200 --> 02:31:36.200]  they've got three month supplies, your supplies,
[02:31:36.200 --> 02:31:38.200]  they've got so many great products there.
[02:31:38.200 --> 02:31:40.200]  And you've got a three year supply.
[02:31:40.200 --> 02:31:42.200]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[02:31:42.200 --> 02:31:44.200]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[02:31:44.200 --> 02:31:47.200]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products
[02:31:47.200 --> 02:31:49.200]  and together with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[02:31:49.200 --> 02:31:51.200]  infowarstore.com
[02:31:51.200 --> 02:31:53.200]  and info war select, high quality storeable foods
[02:31:53.200 --> 02:31:55.200]  powered by my patriots supply.
[02:31:56.200 --> 02:31:58.200]  I want to salute and commend
[02:31:58.200 --> 02:32:00.200]  every man, woman and child
[02:32:00.200 --> 02:32:02.200]  that has supported this broadcast over the years
[02:32:02.200 --> 02:32:04.200]  and that has stood with us.
[02:32:04.200 --> 02:32:06.200]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors
[02:32:06.200 --> 02:32:08.200]  and all of our affiliates.
[02:32:08.200 --> 02:32:10.200]  But I'll tell you like it is, you've seen
[02:32:10.200 --> 02:32:12.200]  the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[02:32:12.200 --> 02:32:14.200]  You're our only sponsors.
[02:32:14.200 --> 02:32:16.200]  And when you don't buy the products,
[02:32:16.200 --> 02:32:18.200]  they're absolutely the best out there.
[02:32:18.200 --> 02:32:20.200]  We aren't able to continue on.
[02:32:20.200 --> 02:32:22.200]  So remember, you are the info war.
[02:32:22.200 --> 02:32:24.200]  I'm not the leader, you are the leader.
[02:32:24.200 --> 02:32:26.200]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[02:32:26.200 --> 02:32:28.200]  We've got giant specials running right now
[02:32:28.200 --> 02:32:30.200]  at infowarstore.com that are unprecedented.
[02:32:30.200 --> 02:32:32.200]  And if you go there and buy great products
[02:32:32.200 --> 02:32:34.200]  that you already need,
[02:32:34.200 --> 02:32:36.200]  from across the board,
[02:32:36.200 --> 02:32:38.200]  it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[02:32:38.200 --> 02:32:40.200]  So I want to thank you for your support
[02:32:40.200 --> 02:32:42.200]  and I want to encourage you again.
[02:32:42.200 --> 02:32:44.200]  Go to infowarstore.com
[02:32:44.200 --> 02:32:46.200]  for whatever the product is you need.
[02:32:46.200 --> 02:32:48.200]  We have thousands of them
[02:32:48.200 --> 02:32:50.200]  and it makes this all possible.
[02:32:50.200 --> 02:32:52.200]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[02:32:52.200 --> 02:33:02.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:22.200 --> 02:33:24.200]  All right, I want to go to Tracy
[02:33:24.200 --> 02:33:26.200]  and all the other callers that have been holding on.
[02:33:26.200 --> 02:33:28.200]  We have Maggie. She's in the house to me in the next hour.
[02:33:28.200 --> 02:33:30.200]  She's back in the studio with us.
[02:33:30.200 --> 02:33:32.200]  And she took off about a year to take care of her grandmother.
[02:33:32.200 --> 02:33:34.200]  It was sick. And then she just took off some more time,
[02:33:34.200 --> 02:33:36.200]  which I think is great.
[02:33:36.200 --> 02:33:38.200]  And then she called up last week and said,
[02:33:38.200 --> 02:33:40.200]  hey, I'm coming to town. I'm going to come on the show and she's here.
[02:33:40.200 --> 02:33:42.200]  So, boy, it's awesome to have her here.
[02:33:42.200 --> 02:33:44.200]  Well, next hour,
[02:33:44.200 --> 02:33:46.200]  I'll get into being banned with Lewis Farrakhan
[02:33:46.200 --> 02:33:48.200]  and Milo Unopolis
[02:33:48.200 --> 02:33:50.200]  for being quote dangerous.
[02:33:50.200 --> 02:33:52.200]  They don't even say why.
[02:33:52.200 --> 02:33:54.200]  They just say, well, he's anti-Semitic like Lewis Farrakhan.
[02:33:54.200 --> 02:33:56.200]  Well, even if that guy's criticized people,
[02:33:56.200 --> 02:33:58.200]  I think he has a right to free speech.
[02:33:58.200 --> 02:34:00.200]  But regardless, this mixing me in with him is crazy.
[02:34:00.200 --> 02:34:02.200]  We'll get to that next hour.
[02:34:02.200 --> 02:34:04.200]  Yeah. And that's all by design, of course,
[02:34:04.200 --> 02:34:06.200]  so that no matter what you say
[02:34:06.200 --> 02:34:08.200]  or it can be discredited
[02:34:08.200 --> 02:34:10.200]  and if anyone wants to talk about you
[02:34:10.200 --> 02:34:12.200]  or share your information
[02:34:12.200 --> 02:34:14.200]  on their social media accounts that still exist,
[02:34:14.200 --> 02:34:16.200]  they can be ostracized
[02:34:16.200 --> 02:34:18.200]  from their community, too,
[02:34:18.200 --> 02:34:20.200]  just like Communist China.
[02:34:20.200 --> 02:34:22.200]  It's almost like the social media giants
[02:34:22.200 --> 02:34:24.200]  are shifting
[02:34:24.200 --> 02:34:26.200]  their rules in terms of service
[02:34:26.200 --> 02:34:28.200]  so that they can do business
[02:34:28.200 --> 02:34:30.200]  in these communist countries.
[02:34:30.200 --> 02:34:32.200]  Oh, no, they admit that's the official plan.
[02:34:32.200 --> 02:34:34.200]  Right. So, they got a shutdown
[02:34:34.200 --> 02:34:36.200]  in dissenting voices, anyone that can...
[02:34:36.200 --> 02:34:38.200]  For a global system of no free speech
[02:34:38.200 --> 02:34:40.200]  except for authoritarians.
[02:34:40.200 --> 02:34:42.200]  And people have to fight back.
[02:34:42.200 --> 02:34:44.200]  That's why Drudge came here, like you said, three years ago
[02:34:44.200 --> 02:34:46.200]  and said, you must do everything
[02:34:46.200 --> 02:34:48.200]  to have your own audio, you must have your own video.
[02:34:48.200 --> 02:34:50.200]  We already had most of that, now we do,
[02:34:50.200 --> 02:34:52.200]  but people then still think we're not on air.
[02:34:52.200 --> 02:34:53.200]  Right. Well...
[02:34:53.200 --> 02:34:55.200]  They think radio and TV doesn't exist now.
[02:34:55.200 --> 02:34:57.200]  They think it's only Facebook,
[02:34:57.200 --> 02:34:59.200]  it's only YouTube, it's only Twitter.
[02:34:59.200 --> 02:35:01.200]  That's the only place I can get my information from.
[02:35:01.200 --> 02:35:03.200]  And then we wonder why everyone is crazy.
[02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:05.200]  I think there was a report out on Drudge the other day
[02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:07.200]  that talked about how,
[02:35:07.200 --> 02:35:09.200]  regardless that the economy's doing good
[02:35:09.200 --> 02:35:11.200]  and people are in a better place
[02:35:11.200 --> 02:35:13.200]  and everyone is still
[02:35:13.200 --> 02:35:15.200]  mentally ill.
[02:35:15.200 --> 02:35:17.200]  People are angry, they're upset,
[02:35:17.200 --> 02:35:19.200]  and they can't...
[02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:21.200]  They can't accept that things are okay.
[02:35:21.200 --> 02:35:23.200]  Have you seen how deranged the left's getting?
[02:35:23.200 --> 02:35:25.200]  Here's the thing,
[02:35:25.200 --> 02:35:27.200]  because I, you know, I have...
[02:35:27.200 --> 02:35:29.200]  A lot of my friends are, like, on the left.
[02:35:29.200 --> 02:35:31.200]  They're progressives, it's, you know,
[02:35:31.200 --> 02:35:33.200]  that's why I'm always kind of torn.
[02:35:33.200 --> 02:35:35.200]  Well, you're a libertarian yourself.
[02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:37.200]  These are real human beings that I love and know.
[02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:39.200]  And so, you know, I just got into a big argument
[02:35:39.200 --> 02:35:41.200]  with a good friend of mine
[02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:43.200]  because she said, you know,
[02:35:43.200 --> 02:35:45.200]  Trump, they brought the Mueller report out
[02:35:45.200 --> 02:35:47.200]  and he's guilty colluding with the Russians
[02:35:47.200 --> 02:35:49.200]  and I'm like, no,
[02:35:49.200 --> 02:35:51.200]  that's absolutely not what that report said.
[02:35:51.200 --> 02:35:53.200]  Yes, it is, it said this,
[02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:55.200]  and there's collusion and obstruction
[02:35:55.200 --> 02:35:57.200]  and I'm just like, no,
[02:35:57.200 --> 02:35:59.200]  that is not true.
[02:35:59.200 --> 02:36:01.200]  What are you talking about?
[02:36:01.200 --> 02:36:03.200]  Actually, and then she's like, well, did you read it?
[02:36:03.200 --> 02:36:05.200]  Did you read it? Well, I don't want to...
[02:36:05.200 --> 02:36:07.200]  I don't want to hear anyone's opinion about it
[02:36:07.200 --> 02:36:09.200]  until they've read the report themselves.
[02:36:09.200 --> 02:36:11.200]  And I'm like, well, did you read it?
[02:36:11.200 --> 02:36:13.200]  Okay, well, then why are you
[02:36:13.200 --> 02:36:15.200]  coming so strongly,
[02:36:15.200 --> 02:36:17.200]  like, attached to this ideology
[02:36:17.200 --> 02:36:19.200]  that the Mueller report
[02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:21.200]  said that Trump colluded with the Russians?
[02:36:21.200 --> 02:36:23.200]  Like, it's just we are dealing
[02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:25.200]  with people who have
[02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:27.200]  their mindset that these are the facts.
[02:36:27.200 --> 02:36:29.200]  They've turned their will over to it because
[02:36:29.200 --> 02:36:31.200]  yeah, it's just...
[02:36:31.200 --> 02:36:33.200]  You've been here, you've been screamed your Russian agent.
[02:36:33.200 --> 02:36:35.200]  You've seen what's happened to us.
[02:36:35.200 --> 02:36:37.200]  I mean, there's no Russians here telling us what to do.
[02:36:37.200 --> 02:36:39.200]  There's no Russian funding, it's our audience funding us.
[02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:41.200]  Did anybody ever tell you what to do here?
[02:36:41.200 --> 02:36:43.200]  No. No.
[02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:45.200]  And that's the thing that's just...
[02:36:45.200 --> 02:36:47.200]  That's why I had to take a step back
[02:36:47.200 --> 02:36:49.200]  because I just... I realize that
[02:36:49.200 --> 02:36:51.200]  we're arguing up against a brick wall.
[02:36:51.200 --> 02:36:53.200]  And it's almost as if our realities
[02:36:53.200 --> 02:36:55.200]  are superimposed.
[02:36:55.200 --> 02:36:57.200]  And so you have the left living in this reality,
[02:36:57.200 --> 02:36:59.200]  the right living in this reality,
[02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:01.200]  and everyone's just yelling at each other,
[02:37:01.200 --> 02:37:03.200]  and they believe that their version of reality
[02:37:03.200 --> 02:37:05.200]  is true. The truth.
[02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:07.200]  And we're not coming together.
[02:37:07.200 --> 02:37:09.200]  99% will not talk
[02:37:09.200 --> 02:37:11.200]  or be normal. They just start screaming,
[02:37:11.200 --> 02:37:13.200]  Alex, murder children.
[02:37:13.200 --> 02:37:15.200]  Alex is a murderer,
[02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:17.200]  and they just start foaming at the mouth and going crazy.
[02:37:17.200 --> 02:37:19.200]  I don't know in this whole weird world
[02:37:19.200 --> 02:37:21.200]  why they chose us to be their main enemy,
[02:37:21.200 --> 02:37:23.200]  but they are just freaked out.
[02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:25.200]  Well, I think it's kind of in their face as well.
[02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:27.200]  A lot of people are kind of
[02:37:27.200 --> 02:37:29.200]  waking up to the fact that the governor of Virginia
[02:37:29.200 --> 02:37:31.200]  for some reason is still the governor of Virginia,
[02:37:31.200 --> 02:37:33.200]  even though he was caught in KKK
[02:37:33.200 --> 02:37:35.200]  robes and blackface.
[02:37:35.200 --> 02:37:37.200]  KKK outfit?
[02:37:37.200 --> 02:37:39.200]  No, I'm going to kill the baby afterwards.
[02:37:39.200 --> 02:37:41.200]  There's a total double standard.
[02:37:41.200 --> 02:37:43.200]  And that was the thing
[02:37:43.200 --> 02:37:45.200]  that I, you know,
[02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:47.200]  that was the only truth
[02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:49.200]  that I could find inside of my heart
[02:37:49.200 --> 02:37:51.200]  was that I needed to take a step back
[02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:53.200]  and get back in touch with my own intuition
[02:37:53.200 --> 02:37:55.200]  and really strengthen
[02:37:55.200 --> 02:37:57.200]  my discernment because
[02:37:57.200 --> 02:37:59.200]  there's just so much misinformation out there
[02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:01.200]  right now and disinformation,
[02:38:01.200 --> 02:38:03.200]  by design, lying to people.
[02:38:03.200 --> 02:38:05.200]  I want to go to Tracy and these calls
[02:38:05.200 --> 02:38:07.200]  and you'll have the floor next hour
[02:38:07.200 --> 02:38:09.200]  and you're awesome for being here.
[02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:11.200]  But I want to ask you, give your real summation
[02:38:11.200 --> 02:38:13.200]  because you called, wanted to come in.
[02:38:13.200 --> 02:38:15.200]  I've been asking you to come in or come on for a year.
[02:38:15.200 --> 02:38:17.200]  You said, listen, I'm unplugged. I'm having to figure this out.
[02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:19.200]  What would you define infowars?
[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:21.200]  Because everybody knows you're a good, smart person,
[02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:23.200]  a very pure person.
[02:38:23.200 --> 02:38:25.200]  When it comes to your view of things,
[02:38:25.200 --> 02:38:27.200]  you're not taking other people's brainwashing in.
[02:38:27.200 --> 02:38:29.200]  How would you define infowars?
[02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:31.200]  Because they project all these lies on us.
[02:38:31.200 --> 02:38:33.200]  That's the tip of the spear.
[02:38:33.200 --> 02:38:35.200]  And if people could go back into our archives,
[02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:37.200]  which now we're going to have to upload everything,
[02:38:37.200 --> 02:38:39.200]  but they would see all of the information
[02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:41.200]  that's there that
[02:38:41.200 --> 02:38:43.200]  they don't want you to have access to.
[02:38:43.200 --> 02:38:45.200]  We really have that now.
[02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:47.200]  Fighting against the dead on
[02:38:47.200 --> 02:38:49.200]  and the fact that you were talking about
[02:38:49.200 --> 02:38:51.200]  5G and the internet
[02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:53.200]  and how they were going to start
[02:38:53.200 --> 02:38:55.200]  controlling what people are able
[02:38:55.200 --> 02:38:57.200]  to access information
[02:38:57.200 --> 02:38:59.200]  and taking you off the internet if you
[02:38:59.200 --> 02:39:01.200]  don't play the game.
[02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:03.200]  And people were like, oh, he's just a crazy guy.
[02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:05.200]  And now it's almost
[02:39:05.200 --> 02:39:07.200]  just a weird irony that they did it
[02:39:07.200 --> 02:39:09.200]  to you first.
[02:39:09.200 --> 02:39:11.200]  But don't the establishment
[02:39:11.200 --> 02:39:13.200]  get, or the public even get,
[02:39:13.200 --> 02:39:15.200]  they're banning us because
[02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:17.200]  they're so afraid of what we're doing.
[02:39:17.200 --> 02:39:19.200]  And now they went, oh, we banned him before it didn't work.
[02:39:19.200 --> 02:39:21.200]  Now let's tie him to Farrakhan.
[02:39:21.200 --> 02:39:23.200]  And I'm not even attacking Farrakhan.
[02:39:23.200 --> 02:39:25.200]  I'm not going to take the cheap trick of saying,
[02:39:25.200 --> 02:39:27.200]  oh, Farrakhan, I'm out with Farrakhan.
[02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:29.200]  I think this now is a cheap trick.
[02:39:29.200 --> 02:39:31.200]  Right. And it is. It's all social programming.
[02:39:31.200 --> 02:39:33.200]  It's all programming so that
[02:39:33.200 --> 02:39:35.200]  people will be ashamed and
[02:39:35.200 --> 02:39:37.200]  embarrassed or whatever
[02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:39.200]  to associate with info wars because
[02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:41.200]  CNN said it was, you know,
[02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:43.200]  anti-Semitic.
[02:39:43.200 --> 02:39:45.200]  People don't understand
[02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:47.200]  how much they're being conditioned
[02:39:47.200 --> 02:39:49.200]  and programmed. And that's
[02:39:49.200 --> 02:39:51.200]  why you've got to step back.
[02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:53.200]  Also saying everything's racist takes away from real racists that are out there and creates racism.
[02:39:53.200 --> 02:39:55.200]  I want to take some calls I said I would,
[02:39:55.200 --> 02:39:57.200]  but I want to get more into this and
[02:39:57.200 --> 02:39:59.200]  you're time forest bathing and everything because I want to go do that too.
[02:39:59.200 --> 02:40:01.200]  Everybody should do it. Study show an hour a day outside
[02:40:01.200 --> 02:40:03.200]  literally makes you way more healthy and happy.
[02:40:03.200 --> 02:40:05.200]  Tracy, you held over
[02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:07.200]  40 minutes and 30 minutes. I appreciate you.
[02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:09.200]  People that didn't hear what you had to say 30 minutes ago.
[02:40:09.200 --> 02:40:11.200]  40 minutes ago
[02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:13.200]  you broke it down saying
[02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:15.200]  Obama gave the orders for the illegal spying.
[02:40:15.200 --> 02:40:17.200]  That's the ace in the hole, the Democrats.
[02:40:17.200 --> 02:40:19.200]  Why Hillary's so arrogant because if then
[02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:21.200]  it leads back to Obama
[02:40:21.200 --> 02:40:23.200]  you can't indict him because he's a former president
[02:40:23.200 --> 02:40:25.200]  and he's black. That's why they're pushing
[02:40:25.200 --> 02:40:27.200]  the race war narrative and everything went
[02:40:27.200 --> 02:40:29.200]  bing bing bing, a big old light bulb went off
[02:40:29.200 --> 02:40:31.200]  over my head. So what other knowledge do you want
[02:40:31.200 --> 02:40:33.200]  to dump on us?
[02:40:33.200 --> 02:40:35.200]  And in all honesty
[02:40:35.200 --> 02:40:37.200]  one, how you doing Mr.
[02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:39.200]  Lynn? Hello there.
[02:40:39.200 --> 02:40:41.200]  Happy back.
[02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:43.200]  One thing about it is what you mention all the time
[02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:45.200]  is the fight guys.
[02:40:45.200 --> 02:40:47.200]  They have one too.
[02:40:47.200 --> 02:40:49.200]  But theirs is of their father.
[02:40:49.200 --> 02:40:51.200]  You know what I mean? And right now
[02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:53.200]  he's still
[02:40:53.200 --> 02:40:55.200]  the fire on his behind.
[02:40:55.200 --> 02:40:57.200]  You're a little bit over driven. Tracy you're awesome.
[02:40:57.200 --> 02:40:59.200]  Back off your phone a little bit. You're just like me.
[02:40:59.200 --> 02:41:01.200]  You're talking loud. Back up a little bit.
[02:41:01.200 --> 02:41:03.200]  Is this a little better? Yes.
[02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:05.200]  That's better. Go ahead, start over. You talk about the fight guys.
[02:41:05.200 --> 02:41:07.200]  Basically what I was saying is
[02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:09.200]  you touch on this just about daily
[02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:11.200]  about the fight guys.
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:13.200]  What we have to realize is that the enemy's
[02:41:13.200 --> 02:41:15.200]  fight guys is just like ours.
[02:41:15.200 --> 02:41:17.200]  It's just as powerful
[02:41:17.200 --> 02:41:19.200]  even though we have the sight of good
[02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:21.200]  everything right now is speeding up
[02:41:21.200 --> 02:41:23.200]  because what you have to realize is
[02:41:23.200 --> 02:41:25.200]  their fight guys wasn't
[02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:27.200]  awakened until Trump was elected.
[02:41:27.200 --> 02:41:29.200]  So for them everything was all good
[02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:31.200]  until Trump was elected.
[02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:33.200]  This is why they're going so crazy
[02:41:33.200 --> 02:41:35.200]  so fast because right now
[02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:37.200]  their world is deteriorating too.
[02:41:37.200 --> 02:41:39.200]  Their life is deteriorating.
[02:41:39.200 --> 02:41:41.200]  You gotta, we did this for
[02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:43.200]  five other callers and I haven't started the podcast yet.
[02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:45.200]  I'm two years behind. Get this guy's name because
[02:41:45.200 --> 02:41:47.200]  every, or get his number, Tracy's
[02:41:47.200 --> 02:41:49.200]  number and info. I want to get him on as a guest
[02:41:49.200 --> 02:41:51.200]  because everything Tracy's saying is crystallizing.
[02:41:51.200 --> 02:41:53.200]  That's exactly right. We have a sight guys.
[02:41:53.200 --> 02:41:55.200]  We have a digital
[02:41:55.200 --> 02:41:57.200]  cellular network. Sixth Sense. The enemy
[02:41:57.200 --> 02:41:59.200]  has one. And their broadcasting
[02:41:59.200 --> 02:42:01.200]  system is saying shut Jones
[02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:03.200]  down. Shut Jones down.
[02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:05.200]  I'm not trying to act powerful. My god though, they're obsessed
[02:42:05.200 --> 02:42:07.200]  with it. What do you think
[02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:09.200]  looking into their sight guys? I'm going to come back to you
[02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:11.200]  and you gotta finish up your Tracy. But right now
[02:42:11.200 --> 02:42:13.200]  why do you think in their sight guys they want to get us?
[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:15.200]  Because
[02:42:15.200 --> 02:42:17.200]  honestly, we're the only thing that stops them
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:19.200]  from the one world government. Our
[02:42:19.200 --> 02:42:21.200]  sight guys, not necessarily Christians
[02:42:21.200 --> 02:42:23.200]  but anybody who doesn't want to
[02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:25.200]  live under anybody.
[02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:27.200]  And that's the number one thing that they want.
[02:42:27.200 --> 02:42:29.200]  They want us to live up under them.
[02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:31.200]  They want serfs, not citizens.
[02:42:31.200 --> 02:42:33.200]  No, that's it. Anybody that has a spirit
[02:42:33.200 --> 02:42:35.200]  don't want to be a slave. Right.
[02:42:35.200 --> 02:42:37.200]  The anti-slavery sight guys. We're going to come right
[02:42:37.200 --> 02:42:39.200]  back and finish up Tracy. He's on fire.
[02:42:39.200 --> 02:42:41.200]  I promised one of the other callers, Leigh Ann Mackenews here with us.
[02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:43.200]  This is awesome to have Leigh Ann back.
[02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:45.200]  I don't even care if I'm getting banned on Facebook
[02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:47.200]  even more because Leigh Ann's here.
[02:42:47.200 --> 02:42:49.200]  It's like a member of the family here.
[02:42:49.200 --> 02:43:15.200]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[02:43:19.200 --> 02:43:21.200]  Thank you so much.

[02:44:35.200 --> 02:44:37.200]  only at the beginning of the colon,
[02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:39.200]  but our premium organic acacia fiber
[02:44:39.200 --> 02:44:41.200]  is slowly digested
[02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:43.200]  by the good bacteria
[02:44:43.200 --> 02:44:45.200]  throughout the entire colon
[02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:47.200]  for maximum prebiotic effect.
[02:44:47.200 --> 02:44:49.200]  Head to infowarslife.com
[02:44:49.200 --> 02:44:55.200]  or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:44:55.200 --> 02:45:24.200]  Let's get started.
[02:45:24.200 --> 02:45:26.200]  We have developed
[02:45:26.200 --> 02:45:28.200]  hands down from our research
[02:45:28.200 --> 02:45:30.200]  the most powerful, healthy energy drink
[02:45:30.200 --> 02:45:32.200]  pre-workout and beyond
[02:45:32.200 --> 02:45:34.200]  system in the world.
[02:45:34.200 --> 02:45:36.200]  If there's nothing else like it,
[02:45:36.200 --> 02:45:38.200]  you must experience it.
[02:45:38.200 --> 02:45:40.200]  It is a total game changer
[02:45:40.200 --> 02:45:42.200]  and it comes in easy to use,
[02:45:42.200 --> 02:45:44.200]  packaged, mixed in with fruit juice,
[02:45:44.200 --> 02:45:46.200]  or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:45:46.200 --> 02:45:48.200]  Warning, though. It's very, very strong.
[02:45:48.200 --> 02:45:50.200]  It lasts up to 10 hours,
[02:45:50.200 --> 02:45:52.200]  so take a half packet the first time you take it
[02:45:52.200 --> 02:45:54.200]  and over drive.
[02:45:54.200 --> 02:45:56.200]  Turbo Force at infowarslife.com
[02:45:56.200 --> 02:45:58.200]  I want to say Brain Force is great.
[02:45:58.200 --> 02:46:00.200]  I want to say Turbo Force is amazing.
[02:46:00.200 --> 02:46:02.200]  It is.
[02:46:02.200 --> 02:46:04.200]  But if you took it with fish oil,
[02:46:04.200 --> 02:46:06.200]  it's like the fish oil is it.
[02:46:06.200 --> 02:46:08.200]  The fish oil is better than it.
[02:46:08.200 --> 02:46:10.200]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[02:46:10.200 --> 02:46:12.200]  Fish oil is liquid energy,
[02:46:12.200 --> 02:46:14.200]  brain, body, heart, the cleanest,
[02:46:14.200 --> 02:46:16.200]  the best out there.
[02:46:16.200 --> 02:46:18.200]  You've got the childrens, you've got the adults,
[02:46:18.200 --> 02:46:20.200]  you've got the krill oil.
[02:46:20.200 --> 02:46:22.200]  And the childrens are really strong.
[02:46:22.200 --> 02:46:24.200]  They don't give you the burpees,
[02:46:24.200 --> 02:46:26.200]  but krill oil is the best
[02:46:26.200 --> 02:46:28.200]  and it'll give you the damn burps.
[02:46:28.200 --> 02:46:30.200]  And I'm sorry, you want something like this,
[02:46:30.200 --> 02:46:32.200]  you don't get stuff for free.
[02:46:32.200 --> 02:46:34.200]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[02:46:34.200 --> 02:46:36.200]  It's so good. In my view.
[02:46:36.200 --> 02:46:38.200]  I'm not making a medical statement here,
[02:46:38.200 --> 02:46:40.200]  but let me tell you something.
[02:46:40.200 --> 02:46:42.200]  I eat five capillettes of krill oil
[02:46:42.200 --> 02:46:44.200]  before I go to bed.
[02:46:44.200 --> 02:46:46.200]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[02:46:46.200 --> 02:46:48.200]  So, your brain
[02:46:48.200 --> 02:46:50.200]  will make a big profit off of it,
[02:46:50.200 --> 02:46:52.200]  but you know what, I'm just obsessed
[02:46:52.200 --> 02:46:54.200]  because whatever the best is we've got,
[02:46:54.200 --> 02:47:19.200]  hey!
[02:47:19.200 --> 02:47:21.200]  Well, Leigh Ann's like Gandalf the Grey.
[02:47:21.200 --> 02:47:23.200]  She's powerful before, but she came back even stronger.
[02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:25.200]  I can't wait next hour. We're going to do it all.
[02:47:25.200 --> 02:47:27.200]  I'll spend a couple segments, like six after,
[02:47:27.200 --> 02:47:29.200]  addressing the Facebook ban.
[02:47:29.200 --> 02:47:31.200]  Then I'm done with it.
[02:47:31.200 --> 02:47:33.200]  It's just part of the course.
[02:47:33.200 --> 02:47:35.200]  We're taking calls right now. I appreciate everybody holding.
[02:47:35.200 --> 02:47:37.200]  Tracy, you said some powerful stuff today,
[02:47:37.200 --> 02:47:39.200]  and I appreciate you holding so long to finish it.
[02:47:39.200 --> 02:47:41.200]  Say what you first said when you were on earlier
[02:47:41.200 --> 02:47:43.200]  and then repeat that about the Zeitgeist
[02:47:43.200 --> 02:47:45.200]  and then lay some more knowledge on this
[02:47:45.200 --> 02:47:47.200]  because I'm not kissing your ass.
[02:47:47.200 --> 02:47:49.200]  Everything you're saying is why I'm taking these calls
[02:47:49.200 --> 02:47:51.200]  because sometimes when I can't figure something out,
[02:47:51.200 --> 02:47:53.200]  open the phones up, there's always one caller
[02:47:53.200 --> 02:47:55.200]  particularly that delivers the goods
[02:47:55.200 --> 02:47:57.200]  or doing it right now, Tracy.
[02:47:57.200 --> 02:47:59.200]  So give me the Zeitgeist.
[02:47:59.200 --> 02:48:01.200]  Alright, so back to what I was saying earlier
[02:48:01.200 --> 02:48:03.200]  about how the whole Civil War
[02:48:03.200 --> 02:48:05.200]  is going to start.
[02:48:05.200 --> 02:48:07.200]  Honestly, I feel like they've been gearing up
[02:48:07.200 --> 02:48:09.200]  for Trump's announcement.
[02:48:09.200 --> 02:48:11.200]  I actually believe that the insurance plan
[02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:13.200]  is them getting caught
[02:48:13.200 --> 02:48:15.200]  because that ensures our destruction
[02:48:15.200 --> 02:48:17.200]  because we're going to revolt
[02:48:17.200 --> 02:48:19.200]  against that, if this makes sense.
[02:48:19.200 --> 02:48:21.200]  You said they're pushing us into revolt.
[02:48:21.200 --> 02:48:23.200]  Yes, sir.
[02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:25.200]  They're pushing us into revolt
[02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:27.200]  which would ultimately lead
[02:48:27.200 --> 02:48:29.200]  to the economic collapse.
[02:48:29.200 --> 02:48:31.200]  It would lead to open borders.
[02:48:31.200 --> 02:48:33.200]  It would actually lead into everything
[02:48:33.200 --> 02:48:35.200]  they're trying to push for now.
[02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:37.200]  And that's why Trump's been so restrained
[02:48:37.200 --> 02:48:39.200]  as he knows their trap.
[02:48:39.200 --> 02:48:41.200]  Yes, sir.
[02:48:41.200 --> 02:48:43.200]  And exactly so,
[02:48:43.200 --> 02:48:45.200]  I truly believe that
[02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:47.200]  like I was saying with the Civil War,
[02:48:47.200 --> 02:48:49.200]  yeah, the indictment is really
[02:48:49.200 --> 02:48:51.200]  what's going to do it.
[02:48:51.200 --> 02:48:53.200]  Well, let me ask you this then.
[02:48:53.200 --> 02:48:55.200]  You're a smart guy. Who is Trump then
[02:48:55.200 --> 02:48:57.200]  in this Panopticon of characters?
[02:48:57.200 --> 02:48:59.200]  What do you think he's thinking right now?
[02:48:59.200 --> 02:49:01.200]  What's your view on Trump?
[02:49:01.200 --> 02:49:03.200]  In all honesty,
[02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:05.200]  I'm with you.
[02:49:05.200 --> 02:49:07.200]  There's a lot of things that I like,
[02:49:07.200 --> 02:49:09.200]  even though he's trying to hold 5G,
[02:49:09.200 --> 02:49:11.200]  the vaccines and all of that.
[02:49:11.200 --> 02:49:13.200]  But in his mind right now, I truly believe
[02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:15.200]  he's just waiting
[02:49:15.200 --> 02:49:17.200]  for the bar to finish up
[02:49:17.200 --> 02:49:19.200]  so he can do the whole counterintelligence
[02:49:19.200 --> 02:49:21.200]  report that they've already got together
[02:49:21.200 --> 02:49:23.200]  the same day that they got
[02:49:23.200 --> 02:49:25.200]  the initial Mueller report.
[02:49:25.200 --> 02:49:27.200]  He's just waiting to drop that.
[02:49:27.200 --> 02:49:29.200]  Oh, let me tell you, he tries everything
[02:49:29.200 --> 02:49:31.200]  he says he's going to do, and let me tell you,
[02:49:31.200 --> 02:49:33.200]  he's coming after him. I mean, it's happening.
[02:49:33.200 --> 02:49:35.200]  And I guess the establishment doesn't want me on air
[02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:37.200]  telling their stay-behind networks
[02:49:37.200 --> 02:49:39.200]  that we're coming for you, but
[02:49:39.200 --> 02:49:41.200]  they won't get off our back.
[02:49:41.200 --> 02:49:43.200]  I don't want to hang their head on the wall
[02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:45.200]  without stopping.
[02:49:45.200 --> 02:49:47.200]  Right, and
[02:49:47.200 --> 02:49:49.200]  what I truly believe is
[02:49:49.200 --> 02:49:51.200]  no one actually wants this.
[02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:53.200]  We have to talk about this in order to stop it.
[02:49:53.200 --> 02:49:55.200]  Mr. Knight says it best,
[02:49:55.200 --> 02:49:57.200]  the only way to stop
[02:49:57.200 --> 02:49:59.200]  bad speech is for free speech,
[02:49:59.200 --> 02:50:01.200]  and right now all we hear is bad speech.
[02:50:01.200 --> 02:50:03.200]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:05.200]  I want to start a show
[02:50:05.200 --> 02:50:07.200]  with the best callers we've got
[02:50:07.200 --> 02:50:09.200]  where every week we do a show
[02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:11.200]  for 3 or 4 hours, where we have 5 or 6 callers
[02:50:11.200 --> 02:50:13.200]  and we have a moderator.
[02:50:13.200 --> 02:50:15.200]  So let's get your name and number, my friend,
[02:50:15.200 --> 02:50:17.200]  and get you on as a regular guest,
[02:50:17.200 --> 02:50:19.200]  because you brought up a lot of powerful points,
[02:50:19.200 --> 02:50:21.200]  and I appreciate callers holding while you laid that out.
[02:50:21.200 --> 02:50:23.200]  Lee, and you can just feel, like you said during the break,
[02:50:23.200 --> 02:50:25.200]  there is an acceleration, there's a time of change,
[02:50:25.200 --> 02:50:27.200]  there's a time of choice happening.
[02:50:27.200 --> 02:50:29.200]  Absolutely, and that's kind of where we're at,
[02:50:29.200 --> 02:50:31.200]  is people who understand
[02:50:31.200 --> 02:50:33.200]  how energy works,
[02:50:33.200 --> 02:50:35.200]  and who understand, you know,
[02:50:35.200 --> 02:50:37.200]  when we come together in groups,
[02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:39.200]  I mean, it's in the Bible to come together
[02:50:39.200 --> 02:50:41.200]  there's a spirit,
[02:50:41.200 --> 02:50:43.200]  there's an energy that is created
[02:50:43.200 --> 02:50:45.200]  when people come together,
[02:50:45.200 --> 02:50:47.200]  and it's palpable if you're in a sports stadium
[02:50:47.200 --> 02:50:49.200]  and everyone's cheering on the other side.
[02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:51.200]  It's like, there's an energy that's created,
[02:50:51.200 --> 02:50:53.200]  and so people in power
[02:50:53.200 --> 02:50:55.200]  or people out there playing chess,
[02:50:55.200 --> 02:50:57.200]  they understand how to take that energy
[02:50:57.200 --> 02:50:59.200]  and drive it in a certain way.
[02:50:59.200 --> 02:51:01.200]  Whereas people are genuinely upset
[02:51:01.200 --> 02:51:03.200]  with the state of affairs,
[02:51:03.200 --> 02:51:05.200]  but then someone is going,
[02:51:05.200 --> 02:51:07.200]  oh, you're very angry,
[02:51:07.200 --> 02:51:09.200]  well, let me take that anger
[02:51:09.200 --> 02:51:11.200]  and I'm going to pass you to this cement.
[02:51:11.200 --> 02:51:13.200]  Everybody has six cents,
[02:51:13.200 --> 02:51:15.200]  they just don't know how to read it,
[02:51:15.200 --> 02:51:17.200]  and so they tell you, you're upset,
[02:51:17.200 --> 02:51:19.200]  there's an enemy taking over,
[02:51:19.200 --> 02:51:21.200]  there's an evil power, it's the Russians,
[02:51:21.200 --> 02:51:23.200]  and people go, yeah, there is an evil,
[02:51:23.200 --> 02:51:25.200]  no, it's the globalist.
[02:51:25.200 --> 02:51:27.200]  I'm not even defending the Russians,
[02:51:27.200 --> 02:51:29.200]  I'm putting Russians down,
[02:51:29.200 --> 02:51:31.200]  but they're a joke compared to the people
[02:51:31.200 --> 02:51:33.200]  running our country,
[02:51:33.200 --> 02:51:35.200]  and they're a joke compared to the Chinese,
[02:51:35.200 --> 02:51:37.200]  they're fashioned or whatever.
[02:51:37.200 --> 02:51:39.200]  They don't want power because they've already got power.
[02:51:39.200 --> 02:51:41.200]  They don't have needle dick syndrome is the issue.
[02:51:41.200 --> 02:51:43.200]  Americans used to have that either,
[02:51:43.200 --> 02:51:45.200]  and so what's going on with the communist Chinese
[02:51:45.200 --> 02:51:47.200]  and these globalists is they want the power
[02:51:47.200 --> 02:51:49.200]  because they don't have it,
[02:51:49.200 --> 02:51:51.200]  and they are literally telling people,
[02:51:51.200 --> 02:51:53.200]  you feel that evil, yeah,
[02:51:53.200 --> 02:51:55.200]  that's Trump and Alex Jones and the Russians,
[02:51:55.200 --> 02:51:57.200]  no man, that's not the evil.
[02:51:57.200 --> 02:51:59.200]  People have to learn, yeah, you're feeling evil,
[02:51:59.200 --> 02:52:01.200]  it isn't us.
[02:52:01.200 --> 02:52:03.200]  You're right, we all do have a sixth sense,
[02:52:03.200 --> 02:52:05.200]  inner knowing, it's our inner wisdom,
[02:52:05.200 --> 02:52:07.200]  it's our birthright, we're born with it,
[02:52:07.200 --> 02:52:09.200]  we are connected to our God,
[02:52:09.200 --> 02:52:11.200]  and the thing is,
[02:52:11.200 --> 02:52:13.200]  is I think with the internet and everything,
[02:52:13.200 --> 02:52:15.200]  it almost raised that frequency,
[02:52:15.200 --> 02:52:17.200]  it pulled everyone's antenna up
[02:52:17.200 --> 02:52:19.200]  a little bit higher to where we were starting
[02:52:19.200 --> 02:52:21.200]  to say, well, wait a minute,
[02:52:21.200 --> 02:52:23.200]  I feel like what this news is giving me
[02:52:23.200 --> 02:52:25.200]  isn't the full story, I feel like this isn't the truth.
[02:52:25.200 --> 02:52:27.200]  Let me go get some information.
[02:52:27.200 --> 02:52:29.200]  Yeah, they thought it would enslave us instead,
[02:52:29.200 --> 02:52:31.200]  it triggered us.
[02:52:31.200 --> 02:52:33.200]  And now they're almost having to scramble
[02:52:33.200 --> 02:52:35.200]  the frequency, because we've raised
[02:52:35.200 --> 02:52:37.200]  our frequency a little bit to have
[02:52:37.200 --> 02:52:39.200]  a higher understanding,
[02:52:39.200 --> 02:52:41.200]  I mean, worldwide,
[02:52:41.200 --> 02:52:43.200]  and so now they're almost having to scramble that frequency.
[02:52:43.200 --> 02:52:45.200]  Yeah, it's happening everywhere, it's happening everywhere.
[02:52:45.200 --> 02:52:47.200]  Right, it's not even in just these little
[02:52:47.200 --> 02:52:49.200]  pockets anymore, I mean,
[02:52:49.200 --> 02:52:51.200]  we're getting to that hundredth monkey syndrome,
[02:52:51.200 --> 02:52:53.200]  and so they know that
[02:52:53.200 --> 02:52:55.200]  it's like time is now,
[02:52:55.200 --> 02:52:57.200]  this is the time to
[02:52:57.200 --> 02:52:59.200]  launch Operation Garden Plot,
[02:52:59.200 --> 02:53:01.200]  and get those frequencies
[02:53:01.200 --> 02:53:03.200]  just kind of really agitated so we can start Civil War,
[02:53:03.200 --> 02:53:05.200]  it's the divide and conquer,
[02:53:05.200 --> 02:53:07.200]  we talk about this all the time. This is an epic time,
[02:53:07.200 --> 02:53:09.200]  and now it's time for prayer, it's time for people
[02:53:09.200 --> 02:53:11.200]  that love decency
[02:53:11.200 --> 02:53:13.200]  and honor to come together, and just be loving,
[02:53:13.200 --> 02:53:15.200]  it's time to reach out, because I can make fun of the left all day
[02:53:15.200 --> 02:53:17.200]  and I do it, then I realize I should be sad
[02:53:17.200 --> 02:53:19.200]  actually for these people, they're captured.
[02:53:19.200 --> 02:53:21.200]  Right, well, and at the end of the day,
[02:53:21.200 --> 02:53:23.200]  we have to remember that these are real human beings,
[02:53:23.200 --> 02:53:25.200]  these are, everyone's
[02:53:25.200 --> 02:53:27.200]  got something going on in their life, nobody knows.
[02:53:27.200 --> 02:53:29.200]  I know your grandmother had
[02:53:29.200 --> 02:53:31.200]  your private stuff,
[02:53:31.200 --> 02:53:33.200]  she had a brain tumor,
[02:53:33.200 --> 02:53:35.200]  and then your mom got cancer,
[02:53:35.200 --> 02:53:37.200]  and then your dad died, and you went through a lot
[02:53:37.200 --> 02:53:39.200]  the last few years.
[02:53:39.200 --> 02:53:41.200]  And the enemy
[02:53:41.200 --> 02:53:43.200]  turned it into, you know,
[02:53:43.200 --> 02:53:45.200]  I raped you or something while you left,
[02:53:45.200 --> 02:53:47.200]  that's what the internet does, it's sick.
[02:53:47.200 --> 02:53:49.200]  Right, yeah, that was the thing,
[02:53:49.200 --> 02:53:51.200]  that was another reason why I just shut it all down,
[02:53:51.200 --> 02:53:53.200]  because everyone was creating all these things.
[02:53:53.200 --> 02:53:55.200]  Like you said, when it rains, it pours.
[02:53:55.200 --> 02:53:57.200]  Last year was hard, I mean everybody
[02:53:57.200 --> 02:53:59.200]  here in the studio, we lost Joe Jennings,
[02:53:59.200 --> 02:54:01.200]  and you know, a few of my
[02:54:01.200 --> 02:54:03.200]  friends' mothers, you know.
[02:54:03.200 --> 02:54:05.200]  Such a sweetheart too. Yeah, it's just
[02:54:05.200 --> 02:54:07.200]  it was a rough year, it was a very tough time,
[02:54:07.200 --> 02:54:09.200]  and a lot of people out there
[02:54:09.200 --> 02:54:11.200]  that want to come up with their own
[02:54:11.200 --> 02:54:13.200]  conspiracy theories about why I wasn't around,
[02:54:13.200 --> 02:54:15.200]  you know, it's just
[02:54:15.200 --> 02:54:17.200]  people need to stop and like realize
[02:54:17.200 --> 02:54:19.200]  the energy that they're putting out in the world.
[02:54:19.200 --> 02:54:21.200]  It's evil, it's evil just to
[02:54:21.200 --> 02:54:23.200]  make up that, you know, Alex Jones
[02:54:23.200 --> 02:54:25.200]  broke Leigh Ann's jaw, that's why she's gone.
[02:54:25.200 --> 02:54:27.200]  We've never kissed each other,
[02:54:27.200 --> 02:54:29.200]  it's all a damn lie, her dad died,
[02:54:29.200 --> 02:54:31.200]  her mom had cancer, her grandmother,
[02:54:31.200 --> 02:54:33.200]  it's like this is the real world people,
[02:54:33.200 --> 02:54:35.200]  this isn't a joke. Right, and that's
[02:54:35.200 --> 02:54:37.200]  what we're kind of losing,
[02:54:37.200 --> 02:54:39.200]  what we need to get back to is our compassion
[02:54:39.200 --> 02:54:41.200]  for each other, and like empathy,
[02:54:41.200 --> 02:54:43.200]  real empathy where we can feel for people
[02:54:43.200 --> 02:54:45.200]  because everybody's going through something,
[02:54:45.200 --> 02:54:47.200]  like everyone is, and
[02:54:47.200 --> 02:54:49.200]  I don't even think people mean
[02:54:49.200 --> 02:54:51.200]  to be bad when they
[02:54:51.200 --> 02:54:53.200]  are like celebrating in full force.
[02:54:53.200 --> 02:54:55.200]  Well, let me tell you, it's like a war cell of
[02:54:55.200 --> 02:54:57.200]  BuzzFeed and others, when they were trying
[02:54:57.200 --> 02:54:59.200]  to take my kids and lying about me in court
[02:54:59.200 --> 02:55:01.200]  and had it on the news and like 30 reporters,
[02:55:01.200 --> 02:55:03.200]  they would laugh at me and lick their lips
[02:55:03.200 --> 02:55:05.200]  like little demons and they thought that was getting to me,
[02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:07.200]  it hurt me that they were so evil.
[02:55:07.200 --> 02:55:09.200]  Like wow, there's this many evil people,
[02:55:09.200 --> 02:55:11.200]  like you go for my kids,
[02:55:11.200 --> 02:55:13.200]  they have no bottom Leigh Ann.
[02:55:13.200 --> 02:55:15.200]  Celebrating the breakup of a family
[02:55:15.200 --> 02:55:17.200]  and just, you know, that's
[02:55:17.200 --> 02:55:19.200]  evil, like that is not
[02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:21.200]  how the hell do they produce so many evil people?
[02:55:23.200 --> 02:55:25.200]  I don't know, and I think it's, you know,
[02:55:25.200 --> 02:55:27.200]  obviously the more power you get
[02:55:27.200 --> 02:55:29.200]  and that's something that
[02:55:29.200 --> 02:55:31.200]  summons the demons. The media has gotten
[02:55:31.200 --> 02:55:33.200]  a lot of power taken away from them
[02:55:33.200 --> 02:55:35.200]  in the last few years because a lot of people are waking up
[02:55:35.200 --> 02:55:37.200]  to the fact that it's just pure propaganda
[02:55:37.200 --> 02:55:39.200]  and whoever their owners are have an agenda.
[02:55:39.200 --> 02:55:41.200]  They don't get it, we don't want power,
[02:55:41.200 --> 02:55:43.200]  I don't want, I want them off my back.
[02:55:43.200 --> 02:55:45.200]  Well, you never even
[02:55:45.200 --> 02:55:47.200]  monetize your videos or anything
[02:55:47.200 --> 02:55:49.200]  until a few, maybe a year or so ago.
[02:55:49.200 --> 02:55:51.200]  You wanted everything to be free,
[02:55:51.200 --> 02:55:53.200]  just everybody download it,
[02:55:53.200 --> 02:55:55.200]  upload it to your own website, I don't care,
[02:55:55.200 --> 02:55:57.200]  I'm not going to hit you with a trademark violation
[02:55:57.200 --> 02:55:59.200]  or anything, you just wanted
[02:55:59.200 --> 02:56:01.200]  the information to be out there.
[02:56:01.200 --> 02:56:03.200]  Anyone can use it, anyone can take it,
[02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:05.200]  and, you know, I think that says a lot,
[02:56:05.200 --> 02:56:07.200]  you know, the difference
[02:56:07.200 --> 02:56:09.200]  between other entities
[02:56:09.200 --> 02:56:11.200]  that are trying to hold on to their power
[02:56:11.200 --> 02:56:13.200]  by any means necessary to the point
[02:56:13.200 --> 02:56:15.200]  that they're making the case
[02:56:15.200 --> 02:56:17.200]  to alter our constitution
[02:56:17.200 --> 02:56:19.200]  and redefine free speech and...
[02:56:19.200 --> 02:56:21.200]  Well, they really came after you
[02:56:21.200 --> 02:56:23.200]  because you were powerful on air
[02:56:23.200 --> 02:56:25.200]  and then you didn't leave because of that
[02:56:25.200 --> 02:56:27.200]  or their fake lawsuits against you,
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:29.200]  you left because your grandmother had a brain tumor,
[02:56:29.200 --> 02:56:31.200]  her mother got cancer, her dad died
[02:56:31.200 --> 02:56:33.200]  all in a year and a half,
[02:56:33.200 --> 02:56:35.200]  and just, you know, I didn't know your dad had died
[02:56:35.200 --> 02:56:37.200]  until you just told me, I knew you went through a lot
[02:56:37.200 --> 02:56:39.200]  and it's just, I know your mom's still fighting
[02:56:39.200 --> 02:56:41.200]  and it's just we're praying for you
[02:56:41.200 --> 02:56:43.200]  and your family leaving.
[02:56:43.200 --> 02:56:45.200]  That's actually one of the reasons
[02:56:45.200 --> 02:56:47.200]  why I really wanted to come back,
[02:56:47.200 --> 02:56:49.200]  to just say thank you to everyone out there
[02:56:49.200 --> 02:56:51.200]  in Info Wars that prayed for my mom,
[02:56:51.200 --> 02:56:53.200]  that donated to her GoFundMe campaign
[02:56:53.200 --> 02:56:55.200]  and she wouldn't have been able to get
[02:56:55.200 --> 02:56:57.200]  surgery on her cancer.
[02:56:57.200 --> 02:56:59.200]  She didn't qualify for any help.
[02:56:59.200 --> 02:57:01.200]  She didn't have insurance.
[02:57:01.200 --> 02:57:03.200]  My mom, like, walks dogs, you know,
[02:57:03.200 --> 02:57:05.200]  for some extra cash.
[02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:07.200]  She takes care of my grandmother full-time.
[02:57:07.200 --> 02:57:09.200]  So she, you know, when we went to the hospital,
[02:57:09.200 --> 02:57:11.200]  even the lady there felt for my mom
[02:57:11.200 --> 02:57:13.200]  and the people who, you know,
[02:57:13.200 --> 02:57:15.200]  are here illegally and can't afford
[02:57:15.200 --> 02:57:17.200]  to have surgery, and this is,
[02:57:17.200 --> 02:57:19.200]  she told us that straight up,
[02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:21.200]  and that's why she was so upset
[02:57:21.200 --> 02:57:23.200]  that my mom couldn't get this surgery.
[02:57:23.200 --> 02:57:25.200]  Oh yeah, none of these illegal aliens,
[02:57:25.200 --> 02:57:27.200]  but they get everything free, citizens don't.
[02:57:27.200 --> 02:57:29.200]  Right, and the lady was so upset about it
[02:57:29.200 --> 02:57:31.200]  that she really went out of her way
[02:57:31.200 --> 02:57:33.200]  to help my mom to make sure,
[02:57:33.200 --> 02:57:35.200]  and just everyone out there at Info Wars,
[02:57:35.200 --> 02:57:37.200]  I just can't even say thank you enough.
[02:57:37.200 --> 02:57:39.200]  My mom really appreciated it too, so.
[02:57:39.200 --> 02:57:41.200]  That's good. We're going to come back with hour number four.
[02:57:41.200 --> 02:57:43.200]  Your phone call straight ahead, then I'll address the subject.
[02:57:43.200 --> 02:57:45.200]  Good.

[02:59:15.200 --> 02:59:17.200]  is a very, very, very
[02:59:17.200 --> 02:59:18.200]  very, very intensive

[02:59:27.200 --> 02:59:29.200]  it's more important than ever
[02:59:29.200 --> 02:59:31.200]  that everyone go to
[02:59:31.200 --> 02:59:33.200]  InfoWars.com
[02:59:33.200 --> 02:59:35.200]  and sign up via email
[02:59:35.200 --> 02:59:37.200]  so there's no way the censors can get between us
[02:59:37.200 --> 02:59:39.200]  with critical videos, articles
[02:59:39.200 --> 02:59:41.200]  breaking news, intel, you name it.
[02:59:41.200 --> 02:59:46.200]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[02:59:49.200 --> 02:59:52.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:01.200 --> 03:00:05.200]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[03:00:05.200 --> 03:00:12.200]  Alex Jones. The four-way conspiracy theorist who was a parent.
[03:00:19.200 --> 03:00:21.200]  Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.200 --> 03:00:26.200]  Stop! Russian, stop!
[03:00:29.200 --> 03:00:31.200]  Info Wars comes to mind.
[03:00:31.200 --> 03:00:38.200]  Reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[03:00:42.200 --> 03:00:47.200]  All right, Leigh Ann, you've got some amazing stuff you want to cover and a bunch of things I want to get to.
[03:00:47.200 --> 03:00:56.200]  I need to make a statement about other channels they left up of ours and the defamation that Facebook's engaged in saying that...
[03:00:56.200 --> 03:01:01.200]  Well, he's been banned because he's dangerous and he's an anti-Semite.
[03:01:01.200 --> 03:01:07.200]  And I don't have the money to sue Facebook. I don't want to, but at a certain point Leigh Ann, how do you respond to stuff like this?
[03:01:07.200 --> 03:01:16.200]  You know, I don't know. You're asking the wrong person. You are such a warrior and a fighter and seem to be able to absorb these attacks.
[03:01:16.200 --> 03:01:24.200]  But it's hard out there in the real world trying to talk to people who are completely brainwashed and trying to convince them otherwise.
[03:01:24.200 --> 03:01:34.200]  And that's why I've just honestly just sort of shut down the argument and like trying to push against people who are totally brainwashed.
[03:01:34.200 --> 03:01:41.200]  And coming at them from more of a loving understanding way and it seems to...
[03:01:41.200 --> 03:01:47.200]  They realize I'm not trying to fight and like bash this information into their brain.
[03:01:47.200 --> 03:01:49.200]  You said that you don't move.
[03:01:49.200 --> 03:01:58.200]  Yeah, I realize my friends, they'll come back around a week or so later and they've softened their tough stance and they actually listen to what I had to say.
[03:01:58.200 --> 03:02:04.200]  Because at the end of the day, we are friends and we do respect each other and that's what we got to get back to.
[03:02:04.200 --> 03:02:10.200]  Maybe you should do a podcast every week with us where it's live or you have guests on where it's kind of like Crowder does.
[03:02:10.200 --> 03:02:12.200]  Change my mind, you have liberals on.
[03:02:12.200 --> 03:02:17.200]  Well, that's what I'd like to... I would love to focus on what's working.
[03:02:17.200 --> 03:02:20.200]  What do we... what can we agree on?
[03:02:20.200 --> 03:02:29.200]  Because every election cycle, you know, where it's just by design, they get us very polarized and they shine the camera on the super polarized, the alt-right, the alt-left.
[03:02:29.200 --> 03:02:31.200]  Sure, but how about real people?
[03:02:31.200 --> 03:02:36.200]  Right, and most people are... we have a lot more in common than we do...
[03:02:36.200 --> 03:02:38.200]  Well, here's an example.
[03:02:38.200 --> 03:02:44.200]  I mean, the media knows that I'm not anti-Israel and if I wanted to be anti-Israel, that's my right.
[03:02:44.200 --> 03:02:55.200]  But they know that I'm one of the hottest figures for decades attacked on the Internet by anti-Semites who are mainly left as funders who want to control the narrative and want to make nationalism racist.
[03:02:55.200 --> 03:03:01.200]  So just to claim that I'm banned from Facebook for being anti-Semitic, it's just outrageous BS.
[03:03:01.200 --> 03:03:03.200]  It's just insane.
[03:03:03.200 --> 03:03:07.200]  I don't hate anybody because they're Jewish or Iranian or Mexican.
[03:03:07.200 --> 03:03:11.200]  I like certain people. I like a lot of Jews. There's a bunch of Jews I dislike.
[03:03:11.200 --> 03:03:15.200]  And I shouldn't have us three even explain that and I'm not going to play race cards here.
[03:03:15.200 --> 03:03:21.200]  It's just that... I never even thought, oh, my ex-wife's part Jewish.
[03:03:21.200 --> 03:03:25.200]  So that means my kids can be called Jewish and then anti-Semites talk about how they want to get my kids.
[03:03:25.200 --> 03:03:30.200]  My kids are just Americans and they're patriots and whatever they want to believe is what they're going to believe.
[03:03:30.200 --> 03:03:33.200]  And they're all self-linified as Christians.
[03:03:33.200 --> 03:03:40.200]  But I mean, it's just sick. It's sick. It's sick to have kids that are part Jewish and be called an anti-Semite.
[03:03:40.200 --> 03:03:42.200]  But I've never said a damn thing against Jews.
[03:03:42.200 --> 03:03:45.200]  I mean, Zuckerberg and your managers screw you.
[03:03:45.200 --> 03:03:51.200]  You're dicks, man. You're jerks, man. You're frauds. That's all I can say.
[03:03:51.200 --> 03:03:55.200]  Yeah. Well, that's the same thing they're saying about the president, that he's anti-Semitic.
[03:03:55.200 --> 03:03:59.200]  Meanwhile, his daughter is and her children, you know?
[03:03:59.200 --> 03:04:01.200]  I don't think they do this.
[03:04:01.200 --> 03:04:06.200]  Yeah. No, that's what I'm saying. It's like we're dealing with crazy clown world.
[03:04:06.200 --> 03:04:15.200]  Like, it makes you crazy. And unfortunately, we're all sitting here trying to dispute what the crazies are saying,
[03:04:15.200 --> 03:04:17.200]  instead of actually talking about what's real.
[03:04:17.200 --> 03:04:19.200]  We're a bunch of liars when listening to a word you say.
[03:04:19.200 --> 03:04:21.200]  We're done with you. We don't even care.
[03:04:21.200 --> 03:04:23.200]  It's just fog of war. They know they've lost.
[03:04:23.200 --> 03:04:25.200]  So they just throw stuff up. It's like, you know.
[03:04:25.200 --> 03:04:28.200]  Right. And respond to this. Respond to that. Fight this.
[03:04:28.200 --> 03:04:30.200]  At some point, you just got to stop.
[03:04:30.200 --> 03:04:33.200]  I had an NPR call me three months ago and they go, we know you're in the KKK. You want to respond.
[03:04:33.200 --> 03:04:38.200]  I said, that's not true. I've never even, I hate that. And they just, they just, they just make stuff up.
[03:04:38.200 --> 03:04:44.200]  To see if you take the bait. Just throw on a fishing expedition as some journalists do.
[03:04:44.200 --> 03:04:47.200]  Oh, Jesus. Let's run through some calls and I'll respond to this.
[03:04:47.200 --> 03:04:51.200]  I'm going to get into your whole Milky Way Nebula breakdown.
[03:04:51.200 --> 03:04:54.200]  You don't want to miss this, folks. Leigh Ann McAdiv.
[03:04:54.200 --> 03:05:06.200]  www.infowarsstore.com.
[03:05:24.200 --> 03:05:29.200]  Air filter technology. And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[03:05:29.200 --> 03:05:33.200]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[03:05:33.200 --> 03:05:37.200]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five star reviews for yourself.
[03:05:37.200 --> 03:05:42.200]  I've got two in my home. You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:05:42.200 --> 03:05:45.200]  with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[03:05:45.200 --> 03:05:51.200]  Don't live in a polluted major city in your home. Have clean air.
[03:05:51.200 --> 03:05:56.200]  www.infowarsstore.com
[03:05:56.200 --> 03:06:23.200]  www.infowarsstore.com
[03:06:23.200 --> 03:06:27.200]  And so the story ends, we're told.
[03:06:27.200 --> 03:06:34.200]  Pachonejo prayers is true. Let's save a few for Leigh Ann too.
[03:06:34.200 --> 03:06:39.200]  She only did what she had to do.
[03:06:39.200 --> 03:06:43.200]  And now she's found the fountain of year.
[03:06:43.200 --> 03:06:47.200]  I swore I'd go to these calls, but I told them earlier, I'd like take 10 calls.
[03:06:47.200 --> 03:06:49.200]  Because the phone system can take like 20.
[03:06:49.200 --> 03:06:53.200]  And I'm never going to get to my guests if other people are holding that I feel guilty, but they're all there.
[03:06:53.200 --> 03:06:55.200]  Leigh Ann, let's just address the censorship now.
[03:06:55.200 --> 03:07:00.200]  Because I said I'd do it at the start of the hour and then I'll go to calls.
[03:07:00.200 --> 03:07:03.200]  I don't know how you respond to just a PR hoax.
[03:07:03.200 --> 03:07:07.200]  People think they're reading a news article and it's, oh Alex Jones banned off more Facebook.
[03:07:07.200 --> 03:07:09.200]  He's not supposed to be on the air.
[03:07:09.200 --> 03:07:12.200]  No, they made false charges 10 months ago.
[03:07:12.200 --> 03:07:18.200]  They took me off a bunch of platforms together as a cartel to make censorship about me instead of everybody else.
[03:07:18.200 --> 03:07:23.200]  And then now they say Lewis Farrakhan, Milo Yiannopoulos, info wars for being dangerous, anti-Semitic,
[03:07:23.200 --> 03:07:27.200]  and give no examples and say they wouldn't give examples and didn't send us any messages.
[03:07:27.200 --> 03:07:33.200]  Why they took down my like private account, a couple old accounts, like in-game the movie and Terror Storm.
[03:07:33.200 --> 03:07:37.200]  From over 10 years ago I'd forgotten about.
[03:07:37.200 --> 03:07:38.200]  Right.
[03:07:38.200 --> 03:07:41.200]  So, what do you think this is?
[03:07:41.200 --> 03:07:47.200]  Well, obviously it's, they can't let you have a tremendous influence on the next election.
[03:07:47.200 --> 03:07:49.200]  This is like do or die time for them.
[03:07:49.200 --> 03:07:55.200]  You know, at least if they're not going to win the presidency, at least they can get the, you know, houses of Congress.
[03:07:55.200 --> 03:07:58.200]  Sure, but I mean, why not, why not?
[03:07:58.200 --> 03:08:01.200]  Why didn't they just ban it all 8, 9, 10 months ago?
[03:08:01.200 --> 03:08:05.200]  Why are they like doling it out and like finding in-game?
[03:08:05.200 --> 03:08:07.200]  No traffic.
[03:08:07.200 --> 03:08:09.200]  We banned him again, dammit.
[03:08:09.200 --> 03:08:14.200]  Which all it does is just make more people want to see what got banned.
[03:08:14.200 --> 03:08:18.200]  Well, I should look into this end game. I should look into this Alex Jones.
[03:08:18.200 --> 03:08:20.200]  Why is he so dangerous, you know?
[03:08:20.200 --> 03:08:25.200]  Until they've got everyone socially programmed that if they even look at it like what happened in New Zealand,
[03:08:25.200 --> 03:08:28.200]  if they even shared a video, it goes to jail.
[03:08:28.200 --> 03:08:31.200]  If you even look at the video, you show armored vehicles running people over,
[03:08:31.200 --> 03:08:34.200]  Islamists is cutting heads off, but don't show what this guy did.
[03:08:34.200 --> 03:08:35.200]  Right.
[03:08:35.200 --> 03:08:37.200]  Yeah, that's totally fine, exactly.
[03:08:37.200 --> 03:08:38.200]  But that's it.
[03:08:38.200 --> 03:08:42.200]  It's just, there's social programming coming down the line.
[03:08:42.200 --> 03:08:45.200]  Paul Joseph Watson reported on this years ago.
[03:08:45.200 --> 03:08:47.200]  Everyone called him crazy and said, oh, yeah,
[03:08:47.200 --> 03:08:54.200]  they think they're going to be changing the Internet to match China's Internet and Internet control system.
[03:08:54.200 --> 03:08:55.200]  And that's exactly where we're headed.
[03:08:55.200 --> 03:08:59.200]  And when people say Kafka, people haven't read Kafka, it's pre-1984.
[03:08:59.200 --> 03:09:02.200]  It's where you get tried in a trial and never told what you did.
[03:09:02.200 --> 03:09:08.200]  So you read this, and it goes, look at this Furcon, any semi, blow-by Alex Jones, dangerous, any semi,
[03:09:08.200 --> 03:09:12.200]  and he's banned, and that's in CNN, runs it all around. Does it say what I did?
[03:09:12.200 --> 03:09:13.200]  They don't tell us.
[03:09:13.200 --> 03:09:18.200]  They just like, well, these five old accounts that some fans set up that you ran, they're all banned.
[03:09:18.200 --> 03:09:19.200]  Mm-hmm.
[03:09:19.200 --> 03:09:22.200]  Well, and that's the other reason why I kind of just wanted to step back,
[03:09:22.200 --> 03:09:26.200]  because I don't want to give them the power or the pleasure to say, well,
[03:09:26.200 --> 03:09:29.200]  now we're going to take you off of your social media accounts
[03:09:29.200 --> 03:09:33.200]  and force you to stop being able to have incomes through.
[03:09:33.200 --> 03:09:35.200]  But then, as you said earlier in the break, it's in the news.
[03:09:35.200 --> 03:09:38.200]  Even though you don't update your site, they keep it.
[03:09:38.200 --> 03:09:41.200]  Everyone communicating with you is still being grabbed and spied on.
[03:09:41.200 --> 03:09:42.200]  Right, exactly.
[03:09:42.200 --> 03:09:49.200]  And even if you delete a Facebook or Instagram or other things from your phone or off your computer,
[03:09:49.200 --> 03:09:54.200]  if you ever clicked on a link that would take you to Facebook, they are tracking you,
[03:09:54.200 --> 03:09:56.200]  and they're getting paid off of you.
[03:09:56.200 --> 03:10:00.200]  My wife's been trying to get off Facebook for two years.
[03:10:00.200 --> 03:10:02.200]  It won't let her delete the account.
[03:10:02.200 --> 03:10:04.200]  Yeah, it just keeps saying, hey, you sure you don't want to?
[03:10:04.200 --> 03:10:08.200]  And she keeps seeing photos from people like, oh, we're still here?
[03:10:08.200 --> 03:10:09.200]  Right, yeah.
[03:10:09.200 --> 03:10:13.200]  That's slavery, man, where it's a company and you can't get off of it.
[03:10:13.200 --> 03:10:16.200]  Right, and they control all the flow of information,
[03:10:16.200 --> 03:10:20.200]  and they've made it to where even businesses, even if businesses wanted to leave Facebook
[03:10:20.200 --> 03:10:23.200]  because they don't like what their business practice is,
[03:10:23.200 --> 03:10:27.200]  that they're only allowing them to reach 5% of their audience
[03:10:27.200 --> 03:10:31.200]  unless they pay them money, pay for this post to reach more of your audience.
[03:10:31.200 --> 03:10:37.200]  Businesses can't leave because the whole system duped everyone into getting sucked into.
[03:10:37.200 --> 03:10:42.200]  Let's be clear, 10, 15 years ago, 12 years ago, technical, 10, 15 years ago,
[03:10:42.200 --> 03:10:47.200]  the internet was 97% millions of websites, everybody surfed the web on different communities.
[03:10:47.200 --> 03:10:53.200]  Now 90% are these big four tech companies, and now once they've got you, they use the monopoly,
[03:10:53.200 --> 03:10:56.200]  we learn, we pay Facebook to reach more, we even wouldn't.
[03:10:56.200 --> 03:11:00.200]  It was like they just had you, and so now this is the takeover.
[03:11:00.200 --> 03:11:04.200]  Right, well, and also I read some articles about how YouTube was,
[03:11:04.200 --> 03:11:09.200]  even any channels that engage in quote-unquote conspiracy theories
[03:11:09.200 --> 03:11:14.200]  were going to be basically shadow banned, and you wouldn't be able to find them,
[03:11:14.200 --> 03:11:17.200]  and the only promoted videos you get are just nonsense.
[03:11:17.200 --> 03:11:19.200]  And then everybody's trying to promote it, it's banned.
[03:11:19.200 --> 03:11:23.200]  So here it is right here, Facebook profits are down, so are Google profits, though.
[03:11:23.200 --> 03:11:26.200]  This is hurting them, they're losing the war.
[03:11:26.200 --> 03:11:33.200]  They say in here that all Alex Jones information is considered dangerous and will be purged,
[03:11:33.200 --> 03:11:36.200]  will be purged from its platform.
[03:11:36.200 --> 03:11:39.200]  So now they're going to the level of saying you won't say his name.
[03:11:39.200 --> 03:11:44.200]  So now we've got to create something like Jack Frost or something that's my code name.
[03:11:44.200 --> 03:11:48.200]  Seriously, we no longer Alex Jones, I'll be Jack Frost or whatever,
[03:11:48.200 --> 03:11:54.200]  because this is what it's reached, and it'll take the big tech system months to figure that out.
[03:11:54.200 --> 03:11:57.200]  It's the level of control. Is this really what we want?
[03:11:57.200 --> 03:12:03.200]  Yeah, making people have to go back to putting up a flyer on, you know, taping it to the telephone.
[03:12:03.200 --> 03:12:05.200]  Oh, we're going to go to that and use it on the head.
[03:12:05.200 --> 03:12:07.200]  We're about to hit the third dimension art.
[03:12:07.200 --> 03:12:10.200]  Yeah, well it's, you know, it's just, I don't really know where we're headed,
[03:12:10.200 --> 03:12:14.200]  but I feel like if we could all just sort of step back and, again,
[03:12:14.200 --> 03:12:17.200]  tune back into our own inner power, our inner wisdom,
[03:12:17.200 --> 03:12:20.200]  we are so much more powerful than these tech giants,
[03:12:20.200 --> 03:12:23.200]  but they've just convinced us that we need them to survive new business.
[03:12:23.200 --> 03:12:27.200]  That's it. They convinced us that the whole universe is them and the Internet,
[03:12:27.200 --> 03:12:29.200]  and there's little digital things where we communicate.
[03:12:29.200 --> 03:12:33.200]  It's us that's powerful, but they get us to go on their platforms, so now they've got us.
[03:12:33.200 --> 03:12:35.200]  And they're like, oh, you think you're so powerful?
[03:12:35.200 --> 03:12:37.200]  Well, we're going to shut down your account.
[03:12:37.200 --> 03:12:39.200]  Why do you think, obviously, I'm the target of this.
[03:12:39.200 --> 03:12:42.200]  Unopolis is kind of retired, Farrakhan's got his own thing going on.
[03:12:42.200 --> 03:12:46.200]  They just mixed me into the middle of this because Trump's winning,
[03:12:46.200 --> 03:12:48.200]  they're about to indict a bunch of Democrats,
[03:12:48.200 --> 03:12:53.200]  and Facebook's getting targeted by the establishment, not doing enough,
[03:12:53.200 --> 03:12:54.200]  so this is their little token.
[03:12:54.200 --> 03:12:56.200]  Oh, look, high band Alex Jones.
[03:12:56.200 --> 03:13:01.200]  Right, and meanwhile, there's a lot of stories about the anti-Semitism
[03:13:01.200 --> 03:13:06.200]  within the Democratic Party, but then that just gets, if you call that out,
[03:13:06.200 --> 03:13:09.200]  then you're being Islamophobic or whatever term it is.
[03:13:09.200 --> 03:13:12.200]  It's like Ilhan Omar says, blow Israel up.
[03:13:12.200 --> 03:13:15.200]  By the way, they've hypnotized the world.
[03:13:15.200 --> 03:13:19.200]  Yeah, yeah, but it's okay for her, and then I'm banned.
[03:13:19.200 --> 03:13:22.200]  Right, that's exactly it.
[03:13:22.200 --> 03:13:24.200]  If you look at Ilhan Omar, the chip on her shoulder,
[03:13:24.200 --> 03:13:27.200]  the level of dark energy and hate when she's up on a podium,
[03:13:27.200 --> 03:13:28.200]  and it's really crazy.
[03:13:28.200 --> 03:13:32.200]  Well, it's just people who don't appreciate this country
[03:13:32.200 --> 03:13:36.200]  and being in this country and being taken in.
[03:13:36.200 --> 03:13:38.200]  She says she hates it, she says it sucks.
[03:13:38.200 --> 03:13:41.200]  Like, I want to go back to a country where they'll cut off my head
[03:13:41.200 --> 03:13:44.200]  if I speak against the government.
[03:13:44.200 --> 03:13:46.200]  Women are slaves in Somalia.
[03:13:46.200 --> 03:13:48.200]  Yeah, it's just...
[03:13:48.200 --> 03:13:50.200]  And then she gets here and she says,
[03:13:50.200 --> 03:13:53.200]  you will take Islam, America suck.
[03:13:53.200 --> 03:13:56.200]  I mean, I can play the white people bad.
[03:13:56.200 --> 03:13:59.200]  Yeah, and it's like, you know,
[03:13:59.200 --> 03:14:01.200]  I can understand a lot of the different arguments
[03:14:01.200 --> 03:14:03.200]  that a lot of different groups want to make
[03:14:03.200 --> 03:14:06.200]  about the evil white man or whatever,
[03:14:06.200 --> 03:14:09.200]  but history is ugly, you know?
[03:14:09.200 --> 03:14:12.200]  A lot of flowers had to...
[03:14:12.200 --> 03:14:15.200]  Why is everybody trying to get into the white devil countries
[03:14:15.200 --> 03:14:18.200]  if they're so bad?
[03:14:18.200 --> 03:14:20.200]  I don't know. That's a good question.
[03:14:20.200 --> 03:14:22.200]  If you ask them that question, you know,
[03:14:22.200 --> 03:14:25.200]  why are people risking their lives to come from Cuba
[03:14:25.200 --> 03:14:29.200]  on a floaty made out of plastic bottles
[03:14:29.200 --> 03:14:32.200]  if it's so great there in their communist country?
[03:14:32.200 --> 03:14:34.200]  They don't have an answer for that
[03:14:34.200 --> 03:14:37.200]  because they've bought into the self-hate.
[03:14:37.200 --> 03:14:40.200]  It's like Ilhan Omar
[03:14:40.200 --> 03:14:44.200]  and Linda Sorcerer came out and said
[03:14:44.200 --> 03:14:47.200]  women shouldn't take their jibs off in Iran.
[03:14:47.200 --> 03:14:49.200]  Like real feminist, real women saying,
[03:14:49.200 --> 03:14:51.200]  I'm not a slave, I'll drive a car.
[03:14:51.200 --> 03:14:53.200]  She's like, no, no, put back on.
[03:14:53.200 --> 03:14:55.200]  And then there's like, damn right, women.
[03:14:55.200 --> 03:14:57.200]  You know, women don't get to walk around
[03:14:57.200 --> 03:14:59.200]  and drive their own cars.
[03:14:59.200 --> 03:15:01.200]  Damn it.
[03:15:01.200 --> 03:15:04.200]  Well, you know, just driving across the country
[03:15:04.200 --> 03:15:06.200]  these last couple weeks,
[03:15:06.200 --> 03:15:09.200]  seeing how much wide open space there is
[03:15:09.200 --> 03:15:13.200]  and there's still a lot of this country
[03:15:13.200 --> 03:15:17.200]  that looks pretty good to some other country
[03:15:17.200 --> 03:15:20.200]  wanting to come in and take out the big bad America.
[03:15:20.200 --> 03:15:22.200]  They would love to see this country fall.
[03:15:22.200 --> 03:15:25.200]  And we're such pleasers and such bend over the barrel.
[03:15:25.200 --> 03:15:28.200]  Exactly. It's like a big flashing sign.
[03:15:28.200 --> 03:15:31.200]  Screw us, screw us, take us over, you're surface.
[03:15:31.200 --> 03:15:33.200]  And Trump comes and says, no, we're not going to do that.
[03:15:33.200 --> 03:15:35.200]  Oh my God, you're the biggest force thing on earth.
[03:15:35.200 --> 03:15:37.200]  You're not going to put up with us railing you?
[03:15:37.200 --> 03:15:39.200]  We'll be back, I promise, with your phone calls.
[03:15:39.200 --> 03:15:42.200]  And Leigh-Anne's got her Milky Way story coming up.
[03:15:42.200 --> 03:15:46.200]  Leigh-Anne McAdoo in studio, the return of Leigh-Anne McAdoo,
[03:15:46.200 --> 03:15:48.200]  NewsWars.com.
[03:15:48.200 --> 03:15:50.200]  Want to upset the sensors? Want to upset Facebook?
[03:15:50.200 --> 03:16:09.200]  NewsWars.com.
[03:16:20.200 --> 03:16:22.200]  All the thrill, only at Slingbow.com.
[03:16:51.200 --> 03:16:54.200]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:16:54.200 --> 03:16:56.200]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[03:16:56.200 --> 03:16:58.200]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:16:58.200 --> 03:16:59.200]  I sued the IRS in one.
[03:16:59.200 --> 03:17:02.200]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:02.200 --> 03:17:04.200]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement
[03:17:04.200 --> 03:17:06.200]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[03:17:06.200 --> 03:17:08.200]  they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:08.200 --> 03:17:09.200]  I can help you too.
[03:17:09.200 --> 03:17:12.200]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:12.200 --> 03:17:14.200]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:17:14.200 --> 03:17:17.200]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website,
[03:17:17.200 --> 03:17:22.200]  DanPilla.com, that's DanPilla.com, DanPilla.com.
[03:17:47.200 --> 03:17:50.200]  50305HBXTrack.com
[03:17:50.200 --> 03:18:19.200]  50305HBXTrack.com
[03:18:20.200 --> 03:18:25.200]  50305HBXTrack.com
[03:18:50.200 --> 03:18:54.200]  Finally, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:19:20.200 --> 03:19:48.200]  50305HBXTrack.com
[03:19:50.200 --> 03:19:57.200]  50305HBXTrack.com
[03:19:57.200 --> 03:20:00.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:00.200 --> 03:20:05.200]  50305HBXTrack.com
[03:20:05.200 --> 03:20:08.200]  Well, I was summoned from Montgomery.
[03:20:08.200 --> 03:20:11.200]  I had my guitar on my back.
[03:20:11.200 --> 03:20:16.200]  When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac.
[03:20:16.200 --> 03:20:22.200]  He was dressed like 1950 at Bronx in Hollywood.
[03:20:22.200 --> 03:20:25.200]  He said it's a long walk to Nashville.
[03:20:25.200 --> 03:20:27.200]  Would you like to ride, son?
[03:20:27.200 --> 03:20:29.200]  Waging War on Corruption.
[03:20:29.200 --> 03:20:35.200]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[03:20:35.200 --> 03:20:49.200]  50305HBXTrack.com
[03:20:49.200 --> 03:20:52.200]  All right, let's get right back to Liam McAdoo in the phone calls.
[03:20:52.200 --> 03:20:53.200]  I just sat on here.
[03:20:53.200 --> 03:20:57.200]  Maybe if Drudge is listening, link to it on Info Wars and just link.
[03:20:57.200 --> 03:21:03.200]  You fire the bat signal up into the sky over Gotham and Batman shows up.
[03:21:03.200 --> 03:21:09.200]  Which is good because it's like them giving you a cigarette when they lead your ass up to the gallows.
[03:21:09.200 --> 03:21:12.200]  Man, they are on our ass, the things they're doing.
[03:21:12.200 --> 03:21:16.200]  And I don't feel bad, actually, because I know Trump is 100 times worse.
[03:21:16.200 --> 03:21:18.200]  Other folks, it's really bad.
[03:21:18.200 --> 03:21:22.200]  And Liam, you're not a victim either, but you got harassed really bad.
[03:21:22.200 --> 03:21:23.200]  They had PIs on you.
[03:21:23.200 --> 03:21:27.200]  They were convinced we were together, which never happened.
[03:21:27.200 --> 03:21:32.200]  We're not victims here, but just people need to know this has been a dirty hard war for a while.
[03:21:32.200 --> 03:21:33.200]  Right.
[03:21:33.200 --> 03:21:36.200]  I mean, that was another reason I had to get out of Austin.
[03:21:36.200 --> 03:21:38.200]  I didn't feel safe here.
[03:21:38.200 --> 03:21:46.200]  We talk about being in these big cities when the stuff hits the fan and you're seeing it.
[03:21:46.200 --> 03:21:47.200]  It's percolating.
[03:21:47.200 --> 03:21:48.200]  It's percolating out there.
[03:21:48.200 --> 03:21:52.200]  And if they label you the enemy or you're a racist...
[03:21:52.200 --> 03:21:53.200]  Well, they say you're a Nazi, man.
[03:21:53.200 --> 03:21:54.200]  These people believe it.
[03:21:54.200 --> 03:21:55.200]  Right.
[03:21:55.200 --> 03:21:56.200]  They think Adolf Hitler's walking down the street.
[03:21:56.200 --> 03:22:01.200]  And they believe they're doing right because they are fighting Nazis.
[03:22:01.200 --> 03:22:04.200]  So it's like this weird warped reality where you can't even say...
[03:22:04.200 --> 03:22:09.200]  And now they have CBS TV shows where they go, I'm going to beat up Nazis and it's Trump supporters.
[03:22:09.200 --> 03:22:11.200]  Is it time to beat up Nazis?
[03:22:11.200 --> 03:22:14.200]  And it's like, we're not Nazis, you crazy maniacs.
[03:22:14.200 --> 03:22:15.200]  Right.
[03:22:15.200 --> 03:22:18.200]  Or was that Cuomo was like praising Antifa.
[03:22:18.200 --> 03:22:25.200]  You know, saying how it's a good cause and not even realizing that they are...
[03:22:25.200 --> 03:22:26.200]  That's dangerous.
[03:22:26.200 --> 03:22:28.200]  I mean, why is he still on the air?
[03:22:28.200 --> 03:22:29.200]  That is dangerous rhetoric.
[03:22:29.200 --> 03:22:34.200]  You are talking up these groups that are actually getting physically violent and raging on their city.
[03:22:34.200 --> 03:22:35.200]  No, I agree.
[03:22:35.200 --> 03:22:36.200]  And we got callers who want to get into this.
[03:22:36.200 --> 03:22:37.200]  I want you to get into this.
[03:22:37.200 --> 03:22:40.200]  But since DrudgeReport.com has linked us to the biggest news site in the world.
[03:22:40.200 --> 03:22:42.200]  Second biggest site, period.
[03:22:42.200 --> 03:22:46.200]  CNN's Oliver Darcy, I got banned for two reasons on Twitter.
[03:22:46.200 --> 03:22:49.200]  They said, beating up a 10-year-old kid, $1 million reward of his show.
[03:22:49.200 --> 03:22:50.200]  It's me.
[03:22:50.200 --> 03:22:51.200]  It wasn't me.
[03:22:51.200 --> 03:22:53.200]  It was an ABC News clip and, quote, harassing a reporter.
[03:22:53.200 --> 03:22:54.200]  He's there at the hearings.
[03:22:54.200 --> 03:22:56.200]  I go, how dare you call for me to be banned?
[03:22:56.200 --> 03:22:57.200]  You modern book burner.
[03:22:57.200 --> 03:22:58.200]  You're like a Nazi.
[03:22:58.200 --> 03:23:00.200]  The left always calls us Nazis.
[03:23:00.200 --> 03:23:02.200]  He wants speech banned.
[03:23:02.200 --> 03:23:07.200]  So now this rat is the person running the story that Drudge is linked to.
[03:23:07.200 --> 03:23:12.200]  Facebook bans Lewis Farrakhan, Milo Yiannopoulos, M4Wars and others for its platforms.
[03:23:12.200 --> 03:23:13.200]  And notice how they did it.
[03:23:13.200 --> 03:23:18.200]  Milo Yiannopoulos is a gay Jewish person who's basically been destroyed.
[03:23:18.200 --> 03:23:22.200]  You've got Lewis Farrakhan with his own issues and then M4Wars.
[03:23:22.200 --> 03:23:26.200]  But they mix it and they say anti-Semitism and hate and dangerousness.
[03:23:26.200 --> 03:23:28.200]  Not fake news, not dangerousness.
[03:23:28.200 --> 03:23:31.200]  Will be purged from the platform.
[03:23:31.200 --> 03:23:34.200]  So they say, Alex Jones will be purged.
[03:23:34.200 --> 03:23:35.200]  Purged.
[03:23:35.200 --> 03:23:36.200]  I'm being purged.
[03:23:36.200 --> 03:23:37.200]  Yeah.
[03:23:37.200 --> 03:23:42.200]  So what do you, if we zoom in more on this, I want to show folks, or pull up the actual
[03:23:42.200 --> 03:23:47.200]  article on Drudge and blow that up for TV viewers, because I'm being purged.
[03:23:47.200 --> 03:23:53.200]  Well, and then you have the whole Democratic Party like rallying around some of their,
[03:23:53.200 --> 03:23:58.200]  the newbies that have been elected that, no, they're not anti-Semitic.
[03:23:58.200 --> 03:24:01.200]  They just have a different way of using the language.
[03:24:01.200 --> 03:24:05.200]  It's okay for them to say these things about Jewish people and, you know, that they've
[03:24:05.200 --> 03:24:08.200]  hypnotized the world and so it's just like.
[03:24:08.200 --> 03:24:12.200]  That's what's upside down is I say that Ilhan Omar has a right to say the stuff.
[03:24:12.200 --> 03:24:14.200]  She says, I don't agree with it or Lewis Farrakhan.
[03:24:14.200 --> 03:24:16.200]  But then they say, we're doing it.
[03:24:16.200 --> 03:24:19.200]  When you go to the Nazi sites, they hate us.
[03:24:19.200 --> 03:24:21.200]  You go to any Nazi site, man.
[03:24:21.200 --> 03:24:22.200]  I'm like right up there with Netanyahu.
[03:24:22.200 --> 03:24:23.200]  Oh, yeah.
[03:24:23.200 --> 03:24:24.200]  They hate me too.
[03:24:24.200 --> 03:24:25.200]  I mean, that's like.
[03:24:25.200 --> 03:24:26.200]  Yeah.
[03:24:26.200 --> 03:24:27.200]  They say you're Jewish.
[03:24:27.200 --> 03:24:28.200]  You're going to get it.
[03:24:28.200 --> 03:24:29.200]  Well, yeah.
[03:24:29.200 --> 03:24:30.200]  I'm supposedly a secret Jew.
[03:24:30.200 --> 03:24:35.200]  You know, my ex-boyfriend is black, you know, and actually FYI, he was black and Mexican.
[03:24:35.200 --> 03:24:36.200]  So that should be worse.
[03:24:36.200 --> 03:24:37.200]  That should make you really mad.
[03:24:37.200 --> 03:24:40.200]  That's what I'm saying is they're accusing us of the opposite.
[03:24:40.200 --> 03:24:41.200]  Yeah.
[03:24:41.200 --> 03:24:45.200]  So like we're banned for being anti-Semitic, but then we're not.
[03:24:45.200 --> 03:24:46.200]  Yeah.
[03:24:46.200 --> 03:24:50.200]  No, but it's like you're bad, but these other people that they need on the Democratic Party
[03:24:50.200 --> 03:24:54.700]  like the governor of Virginia, who was in his KKK robe or black face, we still haven't
[03:24:54.700 --> 03:24:56.200]  gotten to the bottom of which one.
[03:24:56.200 --> 03:25:01.200]  There's no reporters out there figuring out which person he was in that photo.
[03:25:01.200 --> 03:25:04.200]  Like it's just completely gone out of the news cycle.
[03:25:04.200 --> 03:25:08.200]  You know, we never figured out who was in that photo, but that's fine.
[03:25:08.200 --> 03:25:11.200]  You know, it's just, it's the double standard is, it's.
[03:25:11.200 --> 03:25:12.200]  But you read this.
[03:25:12.200 --> 03:25:19.200]  So it's like Jones is purged for his violence and dangerousness and anti-Semitism.
[03:25:19.200 --> 03:25:23.200]  And the average person who's in here watching this must think this is true.
[03:25:23.200 --> 03:25:25.200]  Because again, they didn't just ban me.
[03:25:25.200 --> 03:25:27.200]  They just defamed us, Liam.
[03:25:27.200 --> 03:25:28.200]  Right.
[03:25:28.200 --> 03:25:30.200]  But, but that doesn't, I mean.
[03:25:30.200 --> 03:25:32.200]  Why did Zuckerberg even do this?
[03:25:32.200 --> 03:25:33.200]  Well, it's interesting.
[03:25:33.200 --> 03:25:37.200]  Like you put out the bat signal and Matt Drudge is, you know, there.
[03:25:37.200 --> 03:25:43.200]  But, but Oliver Darcy puts out the bat signal and it's Jack at Twitter and it's like tyrannical
[03:25:43.200 --> 03:25:47.200]  shut down anyone who may hurt my feelings kind of a thing.
[03:25:47.200 --> 03:25:52.200]  It's like CNN and these other places are in cahoots with these tech giants saying, how
[03:25:52.200 --> 03:25:55.200]  can we shut down these conservatives?
[03:25:55.200 --> 03:25:57.200]  There was another story I just saw up on Drudge.
[03:25:57.200 --> 03:26:00.200]  They're trying to brand it as un-news if you're conservative.
[03:26:00.200 --> 03:26:01.200]  Oh, that's right here.
[03:26:01.200 --> 03:26:02.200]  I actually have it.
[03:26:02.200 --> 03:26:06.200]  This Facebook hit us this morning with a strike and shut down one of the accounts.
[03:26:06.200 --> 03:26:07.200]  We know this is over it.
[03:26:07.200 --> 03:26:08.200]  Exclusive.
[03:26:08.200 --> 03:26:11.200]  The measles outbreak is a giant false flag on a hoax.
[03:26:11.200 --> 03:26:12.200]  You watch the video.
[03:26:12.200 --> 03:26:16.200]  I go, no, measles is real, but they're blaming unvaccinated ones for illegal aliens.
[03:26:16.200 --> 03:26:21.200]  And then I showed ABC News, CDC and current reports.
[03:26:21.200 --> 03:26:25.200]  Everything we know about the measles outbreak patients zero and it says it was an illegal
[03:26:25.200 --> 03:26:26.200]  alien from a foreign country.
[03:26:26.200 --> 03:26:28.200]  That's ABC News.
[03:26:28.200 --> 03:26:32.200]  And then I showed Border Patrol releasing thousands who are exposed to diseases like
[03:26:32.200 --> 03:26:33.200]  tuberculosis.
[03:26:33.200 --> 03:26:38.200]  And so I showed Swedish doctors as deadly parasite disease has doubled since refugee wave.
[03:26:38.200 --> 03:26:41.200]  Most people are sick from Syria and Afghanistan.
[03:26:41.200 --> 03:26:43.200]  We're talking bubonic plague.
[03:26:43.200 --> 03:26:46.200]  Leprosy, Leigh Ann.
[03:26:46.200 --> 03:26:54.200]  So this is what we showed in our article, but as you said, Journalism Institute ties
[03:26:54.200 --> 03:26:57.200]  blacklist 29 conservative outlets as un-news.
[03:26:57.200 --> 03:26:59.200]  So here's the thing.
[03:26:59.200 --> 03:27:02.200]  Once you don't defend inforce, first they demonize inforce.
[03:27:02.200 --> 03:27:04.200]  Then once people buy that, then they target everybody.
[03:27:04.200 --> 03:27:05.200]  This is it.
[03:27:05.200 --> 03:27:06.200]  Right.
[03:27:06.200 --> 03:27:07.200]  Exactly.
[03:27:07.200 --> 03:27:08.200]  And that's exactly what happened.
[03:27:08.200 --> 03:27:09.200]  And it's happened so quickly.
[03:27:09.200 --> 03:27:11.200]  So what do you think the president should do?
[03:27:11.200 --> 03:27:13.200]  I mean, to me, this is racketeering.
[03:27:13.200 --> 03:27:14.200]  These are cartels.
[03:27:14.200 --> 03:27:15.200]  It violates section 230.
[03:27:15.200 --> 03:27:17.200]  Then they go to Congress and they have these hearings.
[03:27:17.200 --> 03:27:19.200]  They deny it's happening.
[03:27:19.200 --> 03:27:20.200]  Right.
[03:27:20.200 --> 03:27:25.200]  I mean, to actually have Zuckerberg and others get up there in front of Congress and lie
[03:27:25.200 --> 03:27:31.200]  and say they're not shadow banning people, even though they're on camera, on hidden cameras,
[03:27:31.200 --> 03:27:33.200]  talking about how they...
[03:27:33.200 --> 03:27:34.200]  Oh, yeah.
[03:27:34.200 --> 03:27:35.200]  We shadow ban people.
[03:27:35.200 --> 03:27:36.200]  We just decide...
[03:27:36.200 --> 03:27:37.200]  Project Erratas.
[03:27:37.200 --> 03:27:38.200]  Yeah, all of it.
[03:27:38.200 --> 03:27:39.200]  Yeah.
[03:27:39.200 --> 03:27:44.700]  And then we see how much the media has demonized Project Erratas and O'Keeffe and saying how
[03:27:44.700 --> 03:27:46.200]  they manipulate the footage.
[03:27:46.200 --> 03:27:49.200]  And you just want a libel case proving he didn't edit stuff deceptively.
[03:27:49.200 --> 03:27:50.200]  Exactly.
[03:27:50.200 --> 03:27:52.200]  The guy puts hour-long videos out.
[03:27:52.200 --> 03:27:53.200]  Right.
[03:27:53.200 --> 03:27:54.200]  And who was the...
[03:27:54.200 --> 03:27:59.200]  Was it Katie Couric who did that one anti-gun thing where she totally deceptively edited
[03:27:59.200 --> 03:28:00.200]  the video?
[03:28:00.200 --> 03:28:03.200]  She would edit a totally different question in with something else.
[03:28:03.200 --> 03:28:04.200]  Right.
[03:28:04.200 --> 03:28:05.200]  Just like Megyn Kelly.
[03:28:05.200 --> 03:28:06.200]  Megyn Kelly did to you as well.
[03:28:06.200 --> 03:28:07.200]  I mean, that's...
[03:28:07.200 --> 03:28:09.200]  What's the point with these people, folks?
[03:28:09.200 --> 03:28:10.200]  I mean, I'm telling you, you think you know liars?
[03:28:10.200 --> 03:28:11.200]  No, you don't know liars.
[03:28:11.200 --> 03:28:12.200]  Right, you have to.
[03:28:12.200 --> 03:28:13.200]  So you've experienced them.
[03:28:13.200 --> 03:28:14.200]  You have to.
[03:28:14.200 --> 03:28:15.200]  They'll go, don't you to cry racism?
[03:28:15.200 --> 03:28:16.200]  You'll go, absolutely.
[03:28:16.200 --> 03:28:19.200]  And they'll cut you going, well, I actually defended the second amendment.
[03:28:19.200 --> 03:28:20.200]  Right.
[03:28:20.200 --> 03:28:26.200]  Well, you can show them Bill Clinton praising Robert Byrd and saying, oh, you know, he was
[03:28:26.200 --> 03:28:27.200]  just...
[03:28:27.200 --> 03:28:28.200]  That's what he had to do at the time.
[03:28:28.200 --> 03:28:29.200]  Grand Dragon.
[03:28:29.200 --> 03:28:30.200]  He was...
[03:28:30.200 --> 03:28:31.200]  Yeah, he was the...
[03:28:31.200 --> 03:28:32.200]  No, the Grand Cyclops.
[03:28:32.200 --> 03:28:33.200]  He was the Grand Cyclops.
[03:28:33.200 --> 03:28:34.200]  Grand Cyclopsian.
[03:28:34.200 --> 03:28:35.200]  I don't even know.
[03:28:35.200 --> 03:28:36.200]  Wizards, dragons.
[03:28:36.200 --> 03:28:37.200]  I don't know.
[03:28:37.200 --> 03:28:38.200]  I said I'd take calls.
[03:28:38.200 --> 03:28:39.200]  A lot of folks hung up.
[03:28:39.200 --> 03:28:40.200]  That's fine.
[03:28:40.200 --> 03:28:41.200]  Liberty, Smith, and Bob, you're coming up.
[03:28:41.200 --> 03:28:45.000]  We'll continue to talk about this with Leanne McAdoo and we'll get into some of their other
[03:28:45.000 --> 03:28:46.200]  topics coming up.
[03:28:46.200 --> 03:28:50.600]  But yeah, there's a new world now, man, where they're banning everybody and then they tell
[03:28:50.600 --> 03:28:52.200]  Congress nobody's getting banned.
[03:28:52.200 --> 03:28:55.200]  Okay, so a watch is good and some jewelry.
[03:28:55.200 --> 03:28:56.200]  Better grab some flowers, too.
[03:28:56.200 --> 03:28:57.200]  Hey, what you doing?
[03:28:57.200 --> 03:28:58.200]  Mother's Day, remember?
[03:28:58.200 --> 03:28:59.200]  Oh, yeah.
[03:28:59.200 --> 03:29:02.200]  So I'm making lists, got to plan a trip to the store, then need to save all the receipts
[03:29:02.200 --> 03:29:03.200]  in case she wants to return.
[03:29:03.200 --> 03:29:05.200]  You know there's an easier way, right?

[03:29:54.200 --> 03:29:58.200]  Our grandparents, our great grandparents, know that they can't food during the fall,
[03:29:58.200 --> 03:30:00.200]  so they have it during the winter.
[03:30:00.200 --> 03:30:04.200]  And that's what I'm talking about at M4Store.com.

[03:32:19.200 --> 03:32:22.200]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[03:32:22.200 --> 03:32:25.200]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[03:32:25.200 --> 03:32:30.200]  And that's why the globalist, Hillary, and others are trying to shut M4Wars down.
[03:32:30.200 --> 03:32:34.200]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech,
[03:32:34.200 --> 03:32:37.200]  about taking your very sovereignty away.
[03:32:37.200 --> 03:32:39.200]  This country is in a war.
[03:32:39.200 --> 03:32:42.200]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you,
[03:32:42.200 --> 03:32:44.200]  if you don't spread the articles and videos,
[03:32:44.200 --> 03:32:47.200]  and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us,
[03:32:47.200 --> 03:32:49.200]  and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[03:32:49.200 --> 03:33:18.200]  I'm in your hands. You're in my hands. M4WarsStore.com. Thank you.
[03:33:20.200 --> 03:33:32.200]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:32.200 --> 03:33:35.200]  So dredgereport.com, the number one news site in the world,
[03:33:35.200 --> 03:33:37.200]  is linked to our response right now.
[03:33:37.200 --> 03:33:43.200]  And all I can say is, Leigh Ann, we had more than 40 Facebook pages
[03:33:43.200 --> 03:33:47.200]  that fans created over the decade ago, and they gave them to us.
[03:33:47.200 --> 03:33:49.200]  Those even started to set one up.
[03:33:49.200 --> 03:33:53.200]  And they've gotten rid of, like, almost all of them.
[03:33:53.200 --> 03:33:55.200]  It was the personal Alex Jones page we barely used,
[03:33:55.200 --> 03:33:58.200]  and some old pages for movies we put out.
[03:33:58.200 --> 03:34:01.200]  So now they've banned those for being dangerous,
[03:34:01.200 --> 03:34:03.200]  along with Lewis Farrakhan and Milo Yiannopoulos.
[03:34:03.200 --> 03:34:07.200]  They don't say why we're banned, just that we're these evil anti-Semites or whatever.
[03:34:07.200 --> 03:34:09.200]  And you had some points to make about that,
[03:34:09.200 --> 03:34:14.200]  because obviously, thank God we have our own radio stations,
[03:34:14.200 --> 03:34:17.200]  our own platforms at infowords.com and newswords.com.
[03:34:17.200 --> 03:34:21.200]  We have our own video and audio feeds for folks to go look at and share, hopefully.
[03:34:21.200 --> 03:34:25.200]  But the arrogance of big tech to tell Congress they're not doing this and now do this now,
[03:34:25.200 --> 03:34:30.200]  I think this is in response to the Mueller report falling flat,
[03:34:30.200 --> 03:34:32.200]  the fact that they've been caught illegally spying.
[03:34:32.200 --> 03:34:34.200]  I think this is a temper tantrum.
[03:34:34.200 --> 03:34:38.200]  Right. Well, the CNN has lost, like, 28% of their viewership now,
[03:34:38.200 --> 03:34:40.200]  since this Mueller report's come out.
[03:34:40.200 --> 03:34:43.200]  People are just like, you know what, I'm done with the lies.
[03:34:43.200 --> 03:34:45.200]  Well, they already lost 90%, so yeah.
[03:34:45.200 --> 03:34:49.200]  The tiny audience, their average show has, like, maybe 50,000 viewers.
[03:34:49.200 --> 03:34:52.200]  Yeah, that's why they're mad. That's why they're angry.
[03:34:52.200 --> 03:34:55.200]  And they're thinking, well, we've tried to shut them down,
[03:34:55.200 --> 03:34:58.200]  we've took them off this platform, why is he still reaching so many people?
[03:34:58.200 --> 03:35:04.200]  It's just like they're, you know, every little step that they can take to completely silence you.
[03:35:04.200 --> 03:35:08.200]  And it's funny, because at first, no one really spoke out about it,
[03:35:08.200 --> 03:35:10.200]  but it's happening to so many other people now.
[03:35:10.200 --> 03:35:16.200]  That now even, like, conservatives, they're even tempering what they say
[03:35:16.200 --> 03:35:18.200]  and, like, watching their speech.
[03:35:18.200 --> 03:35:20.200]  Yeah, groveling to these thought police.
[03:35:20.200 --> 03:35:24.200]  I mean, I even this week, for strategic reasons, we didn't want to say what happened,
[03:35:24.200 --> 03:35:27.200]  but they went after and tried to take account of our biggest servers
[03:35:27.200 --> 03:35:29.200]  and just take the URL down.
[03:35:29.200 --> 03:35:31.200]  I mean, we're at URL point.
[03:35:31.200 --> 03:35:34.200]  So people need to know, I mean, this is a real war, folks.
[03:35:34.200 --> 03:35:37.200]  Right. Well, and that's why I just wanted to, like, step back and say,
[03:35:37.200 --> 03:35:40.200]  you know what, I'm not playing your game. Like, you're not in control of me.
[03:35:40.200 --> 03:35:44.200]  I don't want to buy into this new system, this new society and system
[03:35:44.200 --> 03:35:47.200]  that you're trying to set up and control us all.
[03:35:47.200 --> 03:35:48.200]  I just want out.
[03:35:48.200 --> 03:35:51.200]  They're making their moves saying, hey, you need us.
[03:35:51.200 --> 03:35:53.200]  We gave them a monopoly, now they're abusing it.
[03:35:53.200 --> 03:35:54.200]  Wow, what a surprise.
[03:35:54.200 --> 03:35:58.200]  Right. And then earlier, you were talking about the measles story.
[03:35:58.200 --> 03:36:03.200]  We were talking about how they take the anger, genuine anger, genuine confusion,
[03:36:03.200 --> 03:36:06.200]  genuine concern a parent might have for their child.
[03:36:06.200 --> 03:36:13.200]  And they direct, they direct your anger and energy toward their preferred target.
[03:36:13.200 --> 03:36:18.200]  So they want everyone to, they're stirring up all this controversy and anger
[03:36:18.200 --> 03:36:22.200]  so that people are mad at parents who will not vaccinate their children.
[03:36:22.200 --> 03:36:29.200]  Meanwhile, they will not talk about the fact that these patient zeros are coming here illegally,
[03:36:29.200 --> 03:36:31.200]  coming from places where they haven't eradicated this disease.
[03:36:31.200 --> 03:36:32.200]  That's ABC News.
[03:36:32.200 --> 03:36:33.200]  They're not the enemy.
[03:36:33.200 --> 03:36:34.200]  Yeah.
[03:36:34.200 --> 03:36:38.200]  And then when we do a video with a link to this, Facebook bans it and says it's fake.
[03:36:38.200 --> 03:36:39.200]  Right.
[03:36:39.200 --> 03:36:40.200]  Well, and that's false news.
[03:36:40.200 --> 03:36:41.200]  Right.
[03:36:41.200 --> 03:36:44.200]  That's the same thing they're doing here with banning you from all these platforms
[03:36:44.200 --> 03:36:49.200]  calling you dangerous is that they are, they're taking away the fact that they're protecting
[03:36:49.200 --> 03:36:54.200]  anti-Semitic people in their own party or actual racists in their own party.
[03:36:54.200 --> 03:36:57.200]  They're diverting our attention away from that story.
[03:36:57.200 --> 03:36:58.200]  It goes out of the news very quickly.
[03:36:58.200 --> 03:37:02.200]  And then they just want to pull everyone's attention back to their preferred target.
[03:37:02.200 --> 03:37:06.200]  I mean, parents aren't allowed to go on Facebook or YouTube and make comments,
[03:37:06.200 --> 03:37:08.200]  hey, my kid got hurt by vaccines.
[03:37:08.200 --> 03:37:10.200]  You could talk about a hamburger place having a roach leg in it,
[03:37:10.200 --> 03:37:12.200]  or you could talk about a chiropractor did a good job,
[03:37:12.200 --> 03:37:14.200]  or you could talk about other place had good food.
[03:37:14.200 --> 03:37:19.200]  They're saying, no, you aren't allowed to criticize the medical system and tell us what happened.
[03:37:19.200 --> 03:37:20.200]  Right.
[03:37:20.200 --> 03:37:26.200]  I mean, what other country do they have vaccines and like big pharma for profit,
[03:37:26.200 --> 03:37:28.200]  like vaccinating kids en masse?
[03:37:28.200 --> 03:37:29.200]  Like they don't.
[03:37:29.200 --> 03:37:30.200]  Japan's banned it.
[03:37:30.200 --> 03:37:31.200]  It caused so much brain damage.
[03:37:31.200 --> 03:37:32.200]  Right.
[03:37:32.200 --> 03:37:37.200]  It's they don't have pharmaceutical companies ads after the news,
[03:37:37.200 --> 03:37:39.200]  like paying for their news programs.
[03:37:39.200 --> 03:37:42.200]  Oh, well, we're going to cut to this commercial from big pharma.
[03:37:42.200 --> 03:37:44.200]  They don't have that in other countries.
[03:37:44.200 --> 03:37:47.200]  They don't have pharmaceutical ads on their television.
[03:37:47.200 --> 03:37:48.200]  It's not a thing there.
[03:37:48.200 --> 03:37:54.200]  So we are really being targeted and enslaved by big pharma to where they don't want any of this.
[03:37:54.200 --> 03:37:57.200]  They don't want people to ask about the vaccine injury court.
[03:37:57.200 --> 03:37:58.200]  Exactly.
[03:37:58.200 --> 03:38:01.200]  You had your dad die a year ago.
[03:38:01.200 --> 03:38:03.200]  Your mom almost died, grandma, all that.
[03:38:03.200 --> 03:38:04.200]  You went through a lot.
[03:38:04.200 --> 03:38:07.200]  You took off not just from work, but a whole year of just getting focused.
[03:38:07.200 --> 03:38:10.200]  You do seem to be really, you know, in that clairvoyant state.
[03:38:10.200 --> 03:38:12.200]  What do you think's coming in the future?
[03:38:12.200 --> 03:38:14.200]  What do you think Trump needs to do?
[03:38:14.200 --> 03:38:15.200]  What do we need to do?
[03:38:15.200 --> 03:38:16.200]  What is this current battle?
[03:38:16.200 --> 03:38:20.200]  What would you call this space and time that humanity's in right now, Leigh Ann?
[03:38:20.200 --> 03:38:27.200]  Well, I feel like people, it's almost like our energy is being pulled out from us and pulled in all these different directions
[03:38:27.200 --> 03:38:28.200]  so that we can't focus.
[03:38:28.200 --> 03:38:31.200]  And it's forcing us to focus on crazy stuff.
[03:38:31.200 --> 03:38:32.200]  Stealing our energy.
[03:38:32.200 --> 03:38:34.200]  That's not even real stuff that doesn't matter.
[03:38:34.200 --> 03:38:38.200]  I actually, the reason why I sent Daria the picture of the Milky Way galaxy.
[03:38:38.200 --> 03:38:39.200]  Let's put it up.
[03:38:39.200 --> 03:38:41.200]  A friend of mine sent me that.
[03:38:41.200 --> 03:38:42.200]  It's on my bucket list.
[03:38:42.200 --> 03:38:47.200]  I want to go to a place where you can actually, with the naked eye, see the Milky Way galaxy.
[03:38:47.200 --> 03:38:49.200]  And my friend sent me this photo.
[03:38:49.200 --> 03:38:51.200]  This is in Utah at the Salt Flats.
[03:38:51.200 --> 03:38:52.200]  Oh, you can do that here.
[03:38:52.200 --> 03:38:54.200]  You can, this is in the sky all the time.
[03:38:54.200 --> 03:38:57.200]  Yet we can't see it because of the light pollution.
[03:38:57.200 --> 03:39:03.200]  Do you think if people could see this every day and really put it in perspective?
[03:39:03.200 --> 03:39:05.200]  Even in these taxes, you can see it now.
[03:39:05.200 --> 03:39:10.200]  You can't because all the chemtrails, the pollution and what's in the jet stream.
[03:39:10.200 --> 03:39:16.200]  But if you still go out like to Utah or like you said, even even West Texas, it's incredible.
[03:39:16.200 --> 03:39:17.200]  It's amazing.
[03:39:17.200 --> 03:39:22.200]  And if we were able to, like back in the day, you know, people were able to see the sky like that.
[03:39:22.200 --> 03:39:27.200]  It would really put how small we are in perspective and how the little trivial stories
[03:39:27.200 --> 03:39:29.200]  that they're forcing us to be really angry about.
[03:39:29.200 --> 03:39:33.200]  And these little people are making us focus on them and make them gods
[03:39:33.200 --> 03:39:35.200]  instead of just looking at the larger universe.
[03:39:35.200 --> 03:39:37.200]  And by the way, I remember being in Monument Valley, Utah.
[03:39:37.200 --> 03:39:41.200]  I was like 10 years old and staying up almost all night drinking coffee with my dad
[03:39:41.200 --> 03:39:44.200]  because you could see satellites going meaningly.
[03:39:44.200 --> 03:39:47.200]  And you could also see like craft, whatever they were.
[03:39:47.200 --> 03:39:48.200]  Right.
[03:39:48.200 --> 03:39:50.200]  And it's like, whoa, this is like incredible.
[03:39:50.200 --> 03:39:52.200]  No, this is...
[03:39:52.200 --> 03:39:54.200]  We have to transcend realizing Hillary Clinton's not in charge.
[03:39:54.200 --> 03:39:55.200]  Exactly.
[03:39:55.200 --> 03:40:03.200]  And that's what they want us to just all be convinced and everyone's wasting all of their energy arguing about these really inconsequential things.
[03:40:03.200 --> 03:40:08.200]  And just back and forth, Trump, is he a double agent, a triple agent?
[03:40:08.200 --> 03:40:10.200]  Oh, no, I thought he was a complete idiot in the buffoon.
[03:40:10.200 --> 03:40:11.200]  Well, what is it?
[03:40:11.200 --> 03:40:17.200]  Like it's, you know, there's, it doesn't matter really, but we're using so much of our energy.
[03:40:17.200 --> 03:40:19.200]  We as human beings were so incredibly powerful.
[03:40:19.200 --> 03:40:20.200]  Powerful.
[03:40:20.200 --> 03:40:21.200]  Exactly.
[03:40:21.200 --> 03:40:23.200]  They don't want us to actually tap into it.
[03:40:23.200 --> 03:40:24.200]  No, I think of that all the time.
[03:40:24.200 --> 03:40:28.200]  Like, I don't get people to look at the big picture and not cover the minutiae of the system.
[03:40:28.200 --> 03:40:30.200]  And that's really the catch-22, though.
[03:40:30.200 --> 03:40:31.200]  You're right, Leigh Ann.
[03:40:31.200 --> 03:40:33.200]  What a great message you brought to us.
[03:40:33.200 --> 03:40:38.200]  But like, I get, I mean, here I am on a daily basis on YouTube.
[03:40:38.200 --> 03:40:41.200]  All these sites are just like Hitler's good, Alex Jones is bad.
[03:40:41.200 --> 03:40:46.200]  They're all, you see, Google promotes them because of Greats Division.
[03:40:46.200 --> 03:40:48.200]  And then I'm not for the Nazis.
[03:40:48.200 --> 03:40:50.200]  I'm not for the Israel.
[03:40:50.200 --> 03:40:53.200]  I'm just trying to be, you know, I'm kissing their ass.
[03:40:53.200 --> 03:40:55.200]  I mean, it's sick.
[03:40:55.200 --> 03:40:59.200]  They just won't stop, though, because they want you to be in their little group.
[03:40:59.200 --> 03:41:00.200]  Right.
[03:41:00.200 --> 03:41:05.200]  Well, and you can look at the double standard in the governor of Virginia, who was there
[03:41:05.200 --> 03:41:07.200]  in blackface or the KKK hood.
[03:41:07.200 --> 03:41:12.200]  We don't know which one he was because no one seemed to think that that was important
[03:41:12.200 --> 03:41:14.200]  to get to the bottom of that.
[03:41:14.200 --> 03:41:17.200]  But then they said, oh, you know, that was a long time ago.
[03:41:17.200 --> 03:41:21.200]  I mean, granted, he put it on his, you know, yearbook page.
[03:41:21.200 --> 03:41:23.200]  The point is that there's a double standard.
[03:41:23.200 --> 03:41:26.200]  But Brett Kavanaugh, what he allegedly did, that was so important.
[03:41:26.200 --> 03:41:27.200]  Do you know what I mean?
[03:41:27.200 --> 03:41:28.200]  There's like a total double standard.
[03:41:28.200 --> 03:41:30.200]  It's in people's faces.
[03:41:30.200 --> 03:41:32.200]  And I think it's time for people on the left.
[03:41:32.200 --> 03:41:36.200]  I think they're even seeing this double standard to where we're beginning
[03:41:36.200 --> 03:41:38.200]  to understand that we're being lied to.
[03:41:38.200 --> 03:41:39.200]  We're being led by the nose.
[03:41:39.200 --> 03:41:42.200]  Our real genuine feelings are being manipulated.
[03:41:42.200 --> 03:41:43.200]  It's simple.
[03:41:43.200 --> 03:41:45.200]  I mean, the globalist had thought they had America under its control,
[03:41:45.200 --> 03:41:47.200]  and now that's not happening.
[03:41:47.200 --> 03:41:48.200]  So they're freaking out.
[03:41:48.200 --> 03:41:52.200]  I want to come back to a few calls on censorship and what's happening.
[03:41:52.200 --> 03:41:55.200]  But Leigh Ann, again, Dredge is linked to us right now.
[03:41:55.200 --> 03:41:57.200]  People are asking why this is happening.
[03:41:57.200 --> 03:41:59.200]  You read these articles.
[03:41:59.200 --> 03:42:00.200]  You've got them right there.
[03:42:00.200 --> 03:42:02.200]  It says we're purging Alex Jones.
[03:42:02.200 --> 03:42:05.200]  And they don't even give a reason why except talking about anti-Semitism.
[03:42:05.200 --> 03:42:06.200]  Right.
[03:42:06.200 --> 03:42:09.200]  And they know people because people have already, quote unquote,
[03:42:09.200 --> 03:42:11.200]  evolved to the point where they don't even read the articles.
[03:42:11.200 --> 03:42:13.200]  They just read the headlines.
[03:42:13.200 --> 03:42:16.200]  They read the headlines and they read the 150 characters
[03:42:16.200 --> 03:42:18.200]  that might be in a Facebook post.
[03:42:18.200 --> 03:42:20.200]  But don't the authoritarians get the model?
[03:42:20.200 --> 03:42:23.200]  When you say, don't listen to this person, they're dangerous.
[03:42:23.200 --> 03:42:25.200]  All you do is send people there.
[03:42:25.200 --> 03:42:27.200]  But notice, nothing against Farrakhan.
[03:42:27.200 --> 03:42:28.200]  Nothing against Yonopoulos.
[03:42:28.200 --> 03:42:29.200]  Not only Yonopoulos.
[03:42:29.200 --> 03:42:32.200]  Yonopoulos thinks off the radar screen.
[03:42:32.200 --> 03:42:34.200]  Farrakhan is a big following, but he's not really doing much.
[03:42:34.200 --> 03:42:38.200]  It's all about just mixing me in now with this.
[03:42:38.200 --> 03:42:42.200]  Well, why didn't they mix Obama in with Farrakhan?
[03:42:42.200 --> 03:42:43.200]  When, you know what I mean?
[03:42:43.200 --> 03:42:46.200]  Like, why all of a sudden he's dangerous now?
[03:42:46.200 --> 03:42:47.200]  No, it's just all a fraud.
[03:42:47.200 --> 03:42:48.200]  They're test marketing.
[03:42:48.200 --> 03:42:50.200]  Leigh Ann McAdoo is our guest in studio.
[03:42:50.200 --> 03:42:53.200]  The next level of internet censorship's here.
[03:42:53.200 --> 03:42:55.200]  Fueling your body is hard work.
[03:42:55.200 --> 03:42:59.200]  That's why we've introduced the InfoWars Life Daily Digestive Pack
[03:42:59.200 --> 03:43:01.200]  to help you fuel it right.
[03:43:01.200 --> 03:43:04.200]  Combine fluorolife everyday maintenance and carnivore
[03:43:04.200 --> 03:43:06.200]  to help you fuel your gut and body
[03:43:06.200 --> 03:43:09.200]  and take advantage of the powerful nutrients you receive.
[03:43:09.200 --> 03:43:12.200]  There's no better way to power your body.

[03:46:09.200 --> 03:46:11.200]  You're our only sponsors.
[03:46:11.200 --> 03:46:13.200]  And when you don't buy the products,
[03:46:13.200 --> 03:46:15.200]  they're absolutely the best out there.
[03:46:15.200 --> 03:46:17.200]  We aren't able to continue on.
[03:46:17.200 --> 03:46:20.200]  So remember, you are the InfoWars.
[03:46:20.200 --> 03:46:22.200]  I'm not the leader. You are the leader.

[03:46:44.200 --> 03:46:46.200]  We have thousands of them.
[03:46:46.200 --> 03:46:48.200]  And it makes this all possible.

[03:46:50.200 --> 03:47:14.200]  Stop watching.
[03:47:14.200 --> 03:47:21.200]  Well, the war room of Ellen Shroyer is coming up here in about 10 minutes
[03:47:21.200 --> 03:47:23.200]  and remember, you've been told we're not on the air.
[03:47:23.200 --> 03:47:25.200]  Even though we're on over 200 radio stations,
[03:47:25.200 --> 03:47:27.200]  over 100 cable and TV stations,
[03:47:27.200 --> 03:47:29.200]  Baytree News says we're off the air.
[03:47:29.200 --> 03:47:32.200]  We're on the platform.
[03:47:32.200 --> 03:47:34.200]  But there were some Facebook accounts
[03:47:34.200 --> 03:47:36.200]  that quite frankly we weren't really even paying attention to
[03:47:36.200 --> 03:47:38.200]  that Facebook's done a big stunt
[03:47:38.200 --> 03:47:41.200]  to prove the leftist and the EU and the Chikoms
[03:47:41.200 --> 03:47:43.200]  and Hillary, they're a good globalist.
[03:47:43.200 --> 03:47:46.200]  Along with Lewis Farrakhan and Milo Yiannopoulos for being dangerous
[03:47:46.200 --> 03:47:48.200]  and anti-Semitic, I guess Oliver Darcy
[03:47:48.200 --> 03:47:51.200]  that runs the censorship de-platforming system,
[03:47:51.200 --> 03:47:54.200]  he's the one announcing it as usual.
[03:47:54.200 --> 03:47:57.200]  I mean, my God, and then they tell Congress,
[03:47:57.200 --> 03:47:59.200]  oh, we're not censoring anybody.
[03:47:59.200 --> 03:48:01.200]  But they even admit here, oh, we just say it's dangerous,
[03:48:01.200 --> 03:48:02.200]  they're banned.
[03:48:02.200 --> 03:48:04.200]  So, I mean, Trump needs to take action.
[03:48:04.200 --> 03:48:06.200]  And if he does take any kind of action,
[03:48:06.200 --> 03:48:08.200]  he's going to be accused of being a dictator.
[03:48:08.200 --> 03:48:09.200]  Well, so what?
[03:48:09.200 --> 03:48:11.200]  A totalitarian, authoritarian, meanwhile,
[03:48:11.200 --> 03:48:13.200]  that's actually the tech giants that are playing that role.
[03:48:13.200 --> 03:48:15.200]  And we're just buying right into it.
[03:48:15.200 --> 03:48:17.200]  Well, Leigh Ann, you're leaving tomorrow,
[03:48:17.200 --> 03:48:18.200]  and I wish you were staying here longer
[03:48:18.200 --> 03:48:19.200]  but taking care of family and stuff.
[03:48:19.200 --> 03:48:21.200]  Your mom's surgery coming up is what we're praying for.
[03:48:21.200 --> 03:48:23.200]  But I hope you'll go on the war room later if you can.
[03:48:23.200 --> 03:48:26.200]  But just other points you want to make to the folks out there.
[03:48:26.200 --> 03:48:28.200]  Well, you were talking about Endgame,
[03:48:28.200 --> 03:48:30.200]  and even the Endgame was one of the Facebook channels
[03:48:30.200 --> 03:48:32.200]  that got shut down.
[03:48:32.200 --> 03:48:34.200]  And I remembered like 10 plus years ago,
[03:48:34.200 --> 03:48:36.200]  I didn't even know who you were,
[03:48:36.200 --> 03:48:38.200]  and my roommate and I were watching Endgame,
[03:48:38.200 --> 03:48:40.200]  and it was just filled with so much information,
[03:48:40.200 --> 03:48:42.200]  and then that last five minutes, it's like,
[03:48:42.200 --> 03:48:44.200]  by the way, everyone's doing this
[03:48:44.200 --> 03:48:46.200]  because soon they're going to be uploading their brains
[03:48:46.200 --> 03:48:48.200]  to machines and like living forever, kind of,
[03:48:48.200 --> 03:48:49.200]  I forget the whole, you know.
[03:48:49.200 --> 03:48:51.200]  And Leigh had been promised the digital gods
[03:48:51.200 --> 03:48:53.200]  that they must kill you first, which is their own statements.
[03:48:53.200 --> 03:48:54.200]  Right.
[03:48:54.200 --> 03:48:56.200]  And so when, even then, I was like,
[03:48:56.200 --> 03:48:58.200]  whoa, that just, that went left.
[03:48:58.200 --> 03:48:59.200]  What's happening?
[03:48:59.200 --> 03:49:01.200]  Because you're coming up with all this factual information
[03:49:01.200 --> 03:49:04.200]  and then taking it to the future that just seems so unbelievable.
[03:49:04.200 --> 03:49:07.200]  But now we're actually seeing that future come around.
[03:49:07.200 --> 03:49:12.200]  And that, for me, is, that shows me that
[03:49:12.200 --> 03:49:14.200]  we as humans were created in God's image.
[03:49:14.200 --> 03:49:18.200]  We do not need this technology to be able to, you know,
[03:49:18.200 --> 03:49:20.200]  heal ourselves, communicate with each other,
[03:49:20.200 --> 03:49:23.200]  but they've convinced us that we need to get these natural shifts
[03:49:23.200 --> 03:49:25.200]  to be super powerful.
[03:49:25.200 --> 03:49:26.200]  It's the parasite.
[03:49:26.200 --> 03:49:28.200]  Yes, we need to upload to machines.
[03:49:28.200 --> 03:49:30.200]  We need to connect with this technology.
[03:49:30.200 --> 03:49:33.200]  It's the only way we're going to advance as a society.
[03:49:33.200 --> 03:49:35.200]  And that's it.
[03:49:35.200 --> 03:49:37.200]  And again, it's not the technology itself's bad.
[03:49:37.200 --> 03:49:39.200]  It's the Trojan horse commanders.
[03:49:39.200 --> 03:49:40.200]  They are running it.
[03:49:40.200 --> 03:49:43.200]  They've given us these things that we designed,
[03:49:43.200 --> 03:49:45.200]  and then they convinced us that it's God.
[03:49:45.200 --> 03:49:46.200]  Exactly.
[03:49:46.200 --> 03:49:47.200]  And they're playing God.
[03:49:47.200 --> 03:49:50.200]  And they want everyone to get in line,
[03:49:50.200 --> 03:49:53.200]  to be socially programmed so that when they are all connected
[03:49:53.200 --> 03:49:56.200]  to these machines, and, oh, I better not do something bad
[03:49:56.200 --> 03:49:58.200]  because then my social credit score is going down,
[03:49:58.200 --> 03:50:00.200]  and I won't be able to leave the country.
[03:50:00.200 --> 03:50:01.200]  I hadn't read this.
[03:50:01.200 --> 03:50:02.200]  We need to get Paul on a meeting.
[03:50:02.200 --> 03:50:05.200]  Paul Joseph Watson was banned.
[03:50:05.200 --> 03:50:06.200]  He was the real target of this.
[03:50:06.200 --> 03:50:07.200]  He was slaying it.
[03:50:07.200 --> 03:50:08.200]  And Facebook.
[03:50:08.200 --> 03:50:09.200]  Oh, yeah.
[03:50:09.200 --> 03:50:10.200]  I told Paul that.
[03:50:10.200 --> 03:50:12.200]  I told him I said, Paul, wait until you get a million followers
[03:50:12.200 --> 03:50:13.200]  on Twitter.
[03:50:13.200 --> 03:50:15.200]  I guarantee you, as soon as you hit one million followers,
[03:50:15.200 --> 03:50:16.200]  they're going to take you down.
[03:50:16.200 --> 03:50:18.200]  Just to prove a point, just to be like,
[03:50:18.200 --> 03:50:20.200]  because Paul will probably be like, yeah,
[03:50:20.200 --> 03:50:22.200]  I hit a million followers, and they're going to take him down.
[03:50:22.200 --> 03:50:24.200]  Well, that's why encouraging me to start his own site
[03:50:24.200 --> 03:50:26.200]  here, Summit.News.
[03:50:26.200 --> 03:50:28.200]  And to get everybody over there to say, hey,
[03:50:28.200 --> 03:50:29.200]  we'll be banned soon.
[03:50:29.200 --> 03:50:31.200]  You better come over here.
[03:50:31.200 --> 03:50:33.200]  This is systematic.
[03:50:33.200 --> 03:50:36.200]  And let me tell you, they're going to pull some big stuff
[03:50:36.200 --> 03:50:37.200]  before the election.
[03:50:37.200 --> 03:50:38.200]  False flags, you name it.
[03:50:38.200 --> 03:50:39.200]  They don't.
[03:50:39.200 --> 03:50:41.200]  But listen, listeners, you can start a Facebook,
[03:50:41.200 --> 03:50:42.200]  YouTube, whatever.
[03:50:42.200 --> 03:50:44.200]  You can start one about gardening, but then when it comes time,
[03:50:44.200 --> 03:50:46.200]  you're there when the big event happens.
[03:50:46.200 --> 03:50:47.200]  You cover it and tell the truth.
[03:50:47.200 --> 03:50:48.200]  You'll get them.
[03:50:48.200 --> 03:50:49.200]  You won't be stopped.
[03:50:49.200 --> 03:50:50.200]  You're the answer.
[03:50:50.200 --> 03:50:51.200]  You take action.
[03:50:51.200 --> 03:50:52.200]  You get out.
[03:50:52.200 --> 03:50:53.200]  You report.
[03:50:53.200 --> 03:50:54.200]  Start your own website, your own system,
[03:50:54.200 --> 03:50:55.200]  then use these bigger systems,
[03:50:55.200 --> 03:50:57.200]  promote your own website, like Matt Rudd said.
[03:50:57.200 --> 03:50:58.200]  That's the answer.
[03:50:58.200 --> 03:50:59.200]  Yep.
[03:50:59.200 --> 03:51:00.200]  That's genius.
[03:51:00.200 --> 03:51:02.200]  And that's exactly what we need to do.
[03:51:02.200 --> 03:51:04.200]  And I just had Daria talk about here.
[03:51:04.200 --> 03:51:05.200]  Paul Joseph.
[03:51:05.200 --> 03:51:06.200]  Yeah.
[03:51:06.200 --> 03:51:07.200]  Yeah.
[03:51:07.200 --> 03:51:09.200]  He was already going to be co-hosting the fourth hour,
[03:51:09.200 --> 03:51:10.200]  but I want him front and center,
[03:51:10.200 --> 03:51:11.200]  start of the show tomorrow.
[03:51:11.200 --> 03:51:12.200]  Okay.
[03:51:12.200 --> 03:51:13.200]  Thank you.
[03:51:13.200 --> 03:51:14.200]  Yeah.
[03:51:14.200 --> 03:51:16.200]  It'd be interesting to see what he thinks.
[03:51:16.200 --> 03:51:18.200]  But notice they use Lewis Farrakhan because they've,
[03:51:18.200 --> 03:51:19.200]  you know, demonized.
[03:51:19.200 --> 03:51:21.200]  You use some of his quotes that I don't agree with.
[03:51:21.200 --> 03:51:24.200]  And then it's like, in the unopolis and Watson and everybody,
[03:51:24.200 --> 03:51:25.200]  you know.
[03:51:25.200 --> 03:51:28.200]  But it's like they're only demonizing him to take you out.
[03:51:28.200 --> 03:51:30.200]  But you see how it works.
[03:51:30.200 --> 03:51:33.200]  He's totally fine when he's Linda Sarsour's friend and Obama's
[03:51:33.200 --> 03:51:35.200]  having private dinners with him.
[03:51:35.200 --> 03:51:39.200]  And I mean, it's like they just pick in shoes where to direct
[03:51:39.200 --> 03:51:40.200]  people's anger.
[03:51:40.200 --> 03:51:43.200]  And that's why people need to understand that we're all being
[03:51:43.200 --> 03:51:46.200]  played if you allow yourself to be emotionally manipulated.
[03:51:46.200 --> 03:51:51.200]  It's to take a step back and be calm, be rational.
[03:51:51.200 --> 03:51:55.200]  They want us all to be frazzled and insane so that we can't come
[03:51:55.200 --> 03:51:58.200]  from our sovereignty and our inner wisdom.
[03:51:58.200 --> 03:52:00.200]  And that's where we need to get back.
[03:52:00.200 --> 03:52:03.200]  You're talking about the sacred place that Psalms talks about.
[03:52:03.200 --> 03:52:06.200]  I forget the exact Psalm about the quiet place the most high.
[03:52:06.200 --> 03:52:09.200]  Can you guys look up Psalms, the quiet place the most high?
[03:52:09.200 --> 03:52:11.200]  Because there is that place where you get in that.
[03:52:11.200 --> 03:52:12.200]  And you're like totally calm.
[03:52:12.200 --> 03:52:13.200]  You see everything you know.
[03:52:13.200 --> 03:52:15.200]  You're in God's plan and whatever happens.
[03:52:15.200 --> 03:52:18.200]  And you're so powerful in that position.
[03:52:18.200 --> 03:52:20.200]  We need to get in that position every day.
[03:52:20.200 --> 03:52:23.200]  Every day if you can and get out in nature because that's where
[03:52:23.200 --> 03:52:24.200]  you're going to absolutely connect.
[03:52:24.200 --> 03:52:25.200]  All the studies show it.
[03:52:25.200 --> 03:52:27.200]  And the enemy wants to keep us out of nature.
[03:52:27.200 --> 03:52:29.200]  They want you plugged into technology.
[03:52:29.200 --> 03:52:31.200]  And then we see how depressed people are.
[03:52:31.200 --> 03:52:36.200]  Teen suicide rates are up because of the fact that we're not
[03:52:36.200 --> 03:52:37.200]  interacting with each other.
[03:52:37.200 --> 03:52:38.200]  Our community.
[03:52:38.200 --> 03:52:41.200]  I remember being a kid in woodshop in like sixth grade and
[03:52:41.200 --> 03:52:43.200]  carboned this fish with a clock I put in again.
[03:52:43.200 --> 03:52:44.200]  My grandmother, she just died.
[03:52:44.200 --> 03:52:45.200]  I got it back in the house.
[03:52:45.200 --> 03:52:48.200]  And I remember like gardening and how it would get high.
[03:52:48.200 --> 03:52:51.200]  When I was like five years old, my grandfather like planting
[03:52:51.200 --> 03:52:55.200]  strawberries and picking things in line, picking apples.
[03:52:55.200 --> 03:52:57.200]  And I'm like, I would be hallucinating.
[03:52:57.200 --> 03:52:58.200]  I was so happy.
[03:52:58.200 --> 03:53:00.200]  And I still go and do it down the same thing happens.
[03:53:00.200 --> 03:53:01.200]  Yep.
[03:53:01.200 --> 03:53:03.200]  I mean, I'm going to be honest, like literally picking
[03:53:03.200 --> 03:53:05.200]  apples or plowing the fields better than sex, man.
[03:53:05.200 --> 03:53:07.200]  It gets you in the flow.
[03:53:07.200 --> 03:53:08.200]  You hear the bees.
[03:53:08.200 --> 03:53:09.200]  Everything was like, shh.
[03:53:09.200 --> 03:53:10.200]  Yeah.
[03:53:10.200 --> 03:53:14.200]  Well, and also to energetically speaking, it, especially if
[03:53:14.200 --> 03:53:16.200]  you can get out there barefoot or hug a tree, whatever,
[03:53:16.200 --> 03:53:17.200]  some hippy stuff.
[03:53:17.200 --> 03:53:22.200]  But it truly takes the energy that you might, you anger,
[03:53:22.200 --> 03:53:24.200]  frustration, whatever you might feel.
[03:53:24.200 --> 03:53:25.200]  It discharges.
[03:53:25.200 --> 03:53:26.200]  It transmutes it.
[03:53:26.200 --> 03:53:27.200]  The earth absorbs it.
[03:53:27.200 --> 03:53:31.200]  And it, it, it fills you back up with like, you know, that,
[03:53:31.200 --> 03:53:34.200]  that God energy because that's, that's what we are.
[03:53:34.200 --> 03:53:35.200]  No, I agree.
[03:53:35.200 --> 03:53:36.200]  You're absolutely right.
[03:53:36.200 --> 03:53:38.200]  And Leanne, if you look great when you quit a few years ago,
[03:53:38.200 --> 03:53:40.200]  take care of your mom and your dad down, everything else.
[03:53:40.200 --> 03:53:41.200]  God, I'm sorry.
[03:53:41.200 --> 03:53:42.200]  But you, you're re-energized.
[03:53:42.200 --> 03:53:43.200]  I'm really impressed.
[03:53:43.200 --> 03:53:44.200]  Yeah.
[03:53:44.200 --> 03:53:46.200]  Well, I'm not, I'm not just saying this because it sounds good.
[03:53:46.200 --> 03:53:50.200]  I'm speaking from experience, like unplug, get out in nature,
[03:53:50.200 --> 03:53:53.200]  reconnect with that inner wisdom that we all have.
[03:53:53.200 --> 03:53:55.200]  What would the internet do?
[03:53:55.200 --> 03:53:57.200]  Cause I've been thinking about this for 10 years.
[03:53:57.200 --> 03:53:58.200]  I think I was thinking when Trump won,
[03:53:58.200 --> 03:53:59.200]  they really messed with me.
[03:53:59.200 --> 03:54:00.200]  They didn't even get out.
[03:54:00.200 --> 03:54:01.200]  I was about to do the same thing.
[03:54:01.200 --> 03:54:03.200]  To literally just spend time with my kids,
[03:54:03.200 --> 03:54:05.200]  garden, get a ranch or something.
[03:54:05.200 --> 03:54:06.200]  I have a ranch in Texas.
[03:54:06.200 --> 03:54:07.200]  We get a ranch here.
[03:54:07.200 --> 03:54:08.200]  And just cause that's what I get.
[03:54:08.200 --> 03:54:12.200]  I get high, like fixing fence or riding a horse or pulling,
[03:54:12.200 --> 03:54:18.200]  you know, uh, uh, turn upside of the ground or skin in a deer.
[03:54:18.200 --> 03:54:20.200]  It's just like, all my ancestors did it.
[03:54:20.200 --> 03:54:21.200]  Like I'm supposed to do this.
[03:54:21.200 --> 03:54:24.200]  And I like literally like, I get, it's kind of worldly.
[03:54:24.200 --> 03:54:26.200]  Like I want to go back and do that.
[03:54:26.200 --> 03:54:28.200]  And then I didn't do it because I'm so tied to this fight.
[03:54:28.200 --> 03:54:31.200]  But imagine what the internet would do if I like just walked off.
[03:54:31.200 --> 03:54:32.200]  Exactly.
[03:54:32.200 --> 03:54:34.200]  And then they'd be like, oh, we finally defeated him.
[03:54:34.200 --> 03:54:35.200]  Ha, ha, ha.
[03:54:35.200 --> 03:54:38.200]  But meanwhile you're actually just healing yourself,
[03:54:38.200 --> 03:54:42.200]  restrengthening yourself for the big fight because that's,
[03:54:42.200 --> 03:54:43.200]  that's what we're in right now.
[03:54:43.200 --> 03:54:44.200]  We're here.
[03:54:44.200 --> 03:54:45.200]  I agree.
[03:54:45.200 --> 03:54:46.200]  We've got to have this infrastructure to find it.
[03:54:46.200 --> 03:54:47.200]  Everyone.
[03:54:47.200 --> 03:54:48.200]  So.
[03:54:48.200 --> 03:54:49.200]  So it's a free way to get laid off for everything to go.
[03:54:49.200 --> 03:54:50.200]  I'm not this close.
[03:54:50.200 --> 03:54:53.200]  I feel like you built up the operation enough that you have
[03:54:53.200 --> 03:54:56.200]  really great people on this team that would be able to allow
[03:54:56.200 --> 03:54:58.200]  you the time to recharge and.
[03:54:58.200 --> 03:55:00.200]  Well, I've done it at gut level.
[03:55:00.200 --> 03:55:04.200]  Disappearing for about a year or two would like really be the
[03:55:04.200 --> 03:55:05.200]  move.
[03:55:05.200 --> 03:55:08.200]  Just be and believe me, I want it to my God.
[03:55:08.200 --> 03:55:09.200]  Can you even?
[03:55:09.200 --> 03:55:10.200]  I agree.
[03:55:10.200 --> 03:55:11.200]  It's like religious.
[03:55:11.200 --> 03:55:14.200]  I don't want to give the Clintons and the chai comms my attention
[03:55:14.200 --> 03:55:15.200]  and study them.
[03:55:15.200 --> 03:55:16.200]  I don't like look.
[03:55:16.200 --> 03:55:18.200]  It is like the gods get forgotten about.
[03:55:18.200 --> 03:55:19.200]  They die.
[03:55:19.200 --> 03:55:21.200]  I don't want to look at them anymore.
[03:55:21.200 --> 03:55:24.200]  Well, they're hoping that you use all of your energy to focus on
[03:55:24.200 --> 03:55:27.200]  how evil they are and you get so angry and frustrated because
[03:55:27.200 --> 03:55:31.200]  then you're not using your true energy, your, your purpose,
[03:55:31.200 --> 03:55:33.200]  your mission, you know, you're anointing.
[03:55:33.200 --> 03:55:36.200]  You're not using it for what it is because you're distracted
[03:55:36.200 --> 03:55:39.200]  with looking at the enemy and focusing on everything they're
[03:55:39.200 --> 03:55:42.200]  doing versus just being able to like speak your truth.
[03:55:42.200 --> 03:55:43.200]  Yeah.
[03:55:43.200 --> 03:55:46.200]  Don't just, just you're really tempting me right now.
[03:55:46.200 --> 03:55:48.200]  I'm just saying I have dreams about this.
[03:55:48.200 --> 03:55:49.200]  I don't want to.
[03:55:49.200 --> 03:55:52.200]  I have dreams like where I'm like just picking corn, you know,
[03:55:52.200 --> 03:55:55.200]  like ancestral memory, like picking corn or cooking food or
[03:55:55.200 --> 03:55:56.200]  like sweeping.
[03:55:56.200 --> 03:55:59.200]  There's a reason why you're just looking at Hillary's evil face
[03:55:59.200 --> 03:56:00.200]  all day long.
[03:56:00.200 --> 03:56:01.200]  Right.
[03:56:01.200 --> 03:56:05.200]  There's a reason why you and a lot of us are being sent that
[03:56:05.200 --> 03:56:08.200]  message to just like unplug and get back to the basics of what
[03:56:08.200 --> 03:56:09.200]  is real.
[03:56:09.200 --> 03:56:11.200]  I agree for the average parent out there.
[03:56:11.200 --> 03:56:13.200]  You need to take your children, move the country and flee now.
[03:56:13.200 --> 03:56:15.200]  Money, power, none of it means anything.
[03:56:15.200 --> 03:56:16.200]  It means nothing.
[03:56:16.200 --> 03:56:17.200]  It's crap.
[03:56:17.200 --> 03:56:18.200]  It means nothing.
[03:56:18.200 --> 03:56:19.200]  It's just a trap.
[03:56:19.200 --> 03:56:20.200]  It's keeping you in sleep.
[03:56:20.200 --> 03:56:22.200]  Well, notice Obama for a left check.
[03:56:22.200 --> 03:56:24.200]  We need to stop people fleeing to the rural areas.
[03:56:24.200 --> 03:56:25.200]  They called it racist.
[03:56:25.200 --> 03:56:26.200]  Everybody's fleeing.
[03:56:26.200 --> 03:56:28.200]  You need to flee out of these cities.
[03:56:28.200 --> 03:56:29.200]  Right.
[03:56:29.200 --> 03:56:31.200]  Because it's all about control.
[03:56:31.200 --> 03:56:34.200]  And once we get break free from these, these control systems that
[03:56:34.200 --> 03:56:38.200]  are set up and realize our real true power, because that's what
[03:56:38.200 --> 03:56:39.200]  I think we're getting to.
[03:56:39.200 --> 03:56:40.200]  I believe.
[03:56:40.200 --> 03:56:41.200]  Oh, they know it.
[03:56:41.200 --> 03:56:42.200]  We're breaking free.
[03:56:42.200 --> 03:56:43.200]  We're going to win.
[03:56:43.200 --> 03:56:45.200]  We're going to figure out how powerful we are that we don't need
[03:56:45.200 --> 03:56:49.200]  this technology to, to tap into the power that we have.
[03:56:49.200 --> 03:56:50.200]  And we are evolving.
[03:56:50.200 --> 03:56:52.200]  We, I don't know what's happening.
[03:56:52.200 --> 03:56:53.200]  Whatever frequency they're.
[03:56:53.200 --> 03:56:55.200]  Now the enemy scared of what's about to happen.
[03:56:55.200 --> 03:56:56.200]  Yes.
[03:56:56.200 --> 03:56:59.200]  They want us convinced that the only way that we can actually be our
[03:56:59.200 --> 03:57:02.200]  true genius selves is by getting a picture.
[03:57:02.200 --> 03:57:06.200]  Look at Tim Cook or Zuckerberg or they are, they're all slaves.
[03:57:06.200 --> 03:57:08.200]  They just radiate fallen nature.
[03:57:08.200 --> 03:57:11.200]  And then their minions, Hillary and people are even more pathetic.
[03:57:11.200 --> 03:57:15.200]  It's like, it's like we're up on some power trip with God Almighty.
[03:57:15.200 --> 03:57:17.200]  I mean, look at those eyes.
[03:57:17.200 --> 03:57:18.200]  It's like just dead.
[03:57:18.200 --> 03:57:19.200]  It's like a robot.
[03:57:19.200 --> 03:57:20.200]  Yeah.
[03:57:20.200 --> 03:57:22.200]  This is the big spiritual battle that we're all talking about.
[03:57:22.200 --> 03:57:25.200]  So that's why it is so important that our spirit.
[03:57:25.200 --> 03:57:26.200]  Most important.
[03:57:26.200 --> 03:57:27.200]  We are going to see it.
[03:57:27.200 --> 03:57:29.200]  It's like a cool drink of water in the desert.
[03:57:29.200 --> 03:57:30.200]  Great job.
[03:57:30.200 --> 03:57:31.200]  The crew.
[03:57:31.200 --> 03:57:33.200]  I would show her a war room coming up info wars.com.
[03:57:33.200 --> 03:57:34.200]  Sports show.
[03:57:34.200 --> 03:57:35.200]  Thank you.
[03:57:35.200 --> 03:57:36.200]  Drudge report.com.
[03:57:36.200 --> 03:57:37.200]  We fired the bat signal.
[03:57:37.200 --> 03:57:38.200]  How magic is that?
[03:57:38.200 --> 03:57:41.200]  You linked up to this and we know we're over the tower.
[03:57:41.200 --> 03:57:43.200]  We're being censored and banned.
[03:57:43.200 --> 03:57:48.200]  Stacey in the great state of Texas in FEMA region six.
[03:57:48.200 --> 03:57:49.200]  You're on the air worldwide.
[03:57:49.200 --> 03:57:50.200]  Stacey.
[03:57:50.200 --> 03:57:52.200]  It's a talk to you before I get into what I want to say.
[03:57:52.200 --> 03:57:55.200]  I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[03:57:55.200 --> 03:57:57.200]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[03:57:57.200 --> 03:58:02.200]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic root things like that that I trust.
[03:58:02.200 --> 03:58:04.200]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins.
[03:58:04.200 --> 03:58:07.200]  They don't have things that they say that they have in them and they're often not things
[03:58:07.200 --> 03:58:08.200]  that are natural.
[03:58:08.200 --> 03:58:09.200]  I appreciate that.
[03:58:09.200 --> 03:58:10.200]  Well, what happened with ultimate female force?
[03:58:10.200 --> 03:58:11.200]  Tell us about it.
[03:58:11.200 --> 03:58:12.200]  Well, it's really great.
[03:58:12.200 --> 03:58:13.200]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[03:58:13.200 --> 03:58:14.200]  I take it.
[03:58:14.200 --> 03:58:15.200]  It tastes good.
[03:58:15.200 --> 03:58:16.200]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[03:58:16.200 --> 03:58:18.200]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[03:58:18.200 --> 03:58:21.200]  And you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day.
[03:58:21.200 --> 03:58:22.200]  I really like it.
[03:58:22.200 --> 03:58:25.200]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[03:58:25.200 --> 03:58:29.200]  They're known to turbo charge women and then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[03:58:29.200 --> 03:58:32.200]  So, yeah, stamina, libido, energy.
[03:58:32.200 --> 03:58:35.200]  These are amazing things and ultimate female force.
[03:58:35.200 --> 03:58:36.200]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[03:58:36.200 --> 03:58:41.200]  Infowarsstore.com or triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[03:58:45.200 --> 03:58:46.200]  I want to say brain force is great.
[03:58:46.200 --> 03:58:48.200]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[03:58:48.200 --> 03:58:49.200]  It is.
[03:58:49.200 --> 03:58:53.200]  If you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[03:58:53.200 --> 03:58:55.200]  The fish oil is better than it.
[03:58:55.200 --> 03:58:57.200]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:58:57.200 --> 03:59:02.200]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[03:59:02.200 --> 03:59:06.200]  You've got the children's, you've got the adults, you've got the krill oil.
[03:59:06.200 --> 03:59:09.200]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[03:59:09.200 --> 03:59:13.200]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn burps.
[03:59:13.200 --> 03:59:14.200]  And I'm sorry.
[03:59:14.200 --> 03:59:16.200]  You want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[03:59:16.200 --> 03:59:18.200]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[03:59:18.200 --> 03:59:19.200]  It's so good.
[03:59:19.200 --> 03:59:20.200]  It might be.
[03:59:20.200 --> 03:59:21.200]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[03:59:21.200 --> 03:59:24.200]  I eat five capillots of krill oil before I go to bed.
[03:59:24.200 --> 03:59:26.200]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[03:59:27.200 --> 03:59:32.200]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:59:35.200 --> 03:59:37.200]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you know what?
[03:59:37.200 --> 03:59:41.200]  I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[03:59:41.200 --> 03:59:42.200]  I just can't do it.
[03:59:42.200 --> 03:59:47.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
