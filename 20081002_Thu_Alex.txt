[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:33.880]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones it is October 1st 2000 and
[00:33.880 --> 00:42.240]  April to be live here for the next four hours we have four amazing guests coming up in one hour
[00:42.240 --> 00:53.600]  Andrew Gauss just a very informative extremely powerful speaker now on what's happening with
[00:53.600 --> 00:59.840]  the economy I think I'll be very impressed with him if you don't know who he is George Butler
[00:59.840 --> 01:05.960]  local talk show host and a talk show us right here on GCN as well he'll be popping in for an
[01:05.960 --> 01:12.800]  hour-long visit then we have Peter Schiff who's one of Ron Paul's main economic advisors again
[01:12.800 --> 01:20.400]  very impressive economic credentials and just stunning on target analysis we'll get his perspective
[01:20.400 --> 01:30.640]  so that is coming up today we also have another surprise guest that's going to be popping in
[01:30.640 --> 01:42.640]  but Andrew Gauss George Butler Peter Schiff and others today well in the last two weeks since
[01:42.640 --> 01:52.640]  they started quote publishing the economic bailout plan it has been very hard to find it the
[01:52.640 --> 01:59.880]  public only got a few hours on Monday to look at what was secretly written up on Sunday last week
[01:59.880 --> 02:08.800]  and it turned out it was complete and total immunity imperial god emperor powers I mean no
[02:08.800 --> 02:14.920]  oversight no control the Treasury can do anything it wants it it'll now be basically private with
[02:14.920 --> 02:20.840]  the Federal Reserve government of foreign by a select group of criminal what are known as
[02:20.840 --> 02:29.840]  international bankers but they're just scam artist on and on and on five trillion not seven hundred
[02:29.840 --> 02:37.520]  billion that's Bloomberg and others saying around five trillion others say three trillion others
[02:37.520 --> 02:52.480]  say nine trillion but five trillion's the conservative numbers that shows and then later last week and
[02:52.480 --> 03:07.360]  then into this week they claim on the Senate website they're posting the bill but in
[03:07.360 --> 03:13.800]  three or four different browsers computers at home of the office for curtain demo out in New
[03:13.800 --> 03:22.720]  Mexico no one could basically download it and most people can't even read it and we finally
[03:22.720 --> 03:31.240]  been able to get a copy and get it up on info wars dot com putting on our own server but inside
[03:31.240 --> 03:36.440]  the PDF file there's some type of corruption which is originally on the Senate and House website
[03:36.440 --> 03:44.800]  where even more people can't get it there I finally was able to print off a copy and the
[03:44.800 --> 03:54.440]  entire thing is pork barrel it's now close to five hundred pages it has immunity in the words of
[03:54.440 --> 03:59.600]  the Washington Post and by the way I've only read part of the bill I haven't had time to read
[03:59.600 --> 04:04.160]  all four hundred and seventy something pages I have scanned over it and I have a long list of
[04:04.160 --> 04:07.720]  notes here and we're going to be having some experts on today who've looked at it as well
[04:07.720 --> 04:13.320]  and this is a big novel to tackle and it's also in legalese but in the words of the
[04:13.320 --> 04:17.360]  Washington Post which is the establishment but they're telling the truth here they say
[04:17.360 --> 04:23.280]  sweeping new powers for the Treasury and their twenty something page breakdown of section by
[04:23.280 --> 04:35.600]  section and it's far worse than even what the Washington Post is is saying but in their
[04:35.600 --> 04:42.440]  words sweeping powers for the treasure and it's all in there it's just stated in more
[04:42.440 --> 04:52.560]  legalese than the first bill that we saw last week that said that the Treasury was above the
[04:52.560 --> 04:58.160]  law and that no one could even review that no one could even question any branch of government
[04:58.160 --> 05:09.480]  any court well it's it's all in there you like being a puppet sir you like being a

[10:41.080 --> 10:42.960]  not just nationally
[10:42.960 --> 10:45.000]  and uh... you know
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.920]  we had the eyewitnesses we had the insiders

[11:50.880 --> 11:52.400]  the politicians
[11:52.400 --> 11:55.840]  this is going back eleven years ago laugh at me in a parking lot after a
[11:55.840 --> 11:56.760]  debate
[11:56.760 --> 11:58.720]  and say yeah we're gonna take it all

[13:00.000 --> 13:02.880]  came from china
[13:02.880 --> 13:05.040]  most of the vaccines you take
[13:05.040 --> 13:08.720]  are filled with cancer viruses
[13:08.720 --> 13:12.840]  and many of the blood drugs are filled with hiv and it's all true and it's all
[13:12.840 --> 13:17.120]  happening and the you know we're going from one in a thousand having diabetes to
[13:17.120 --> 13:21.520]  one in three and one in thirty three with cancer now to one in two and men
[13:21.520 --> 13:24.880]  the other number just change from one in three
[13:24.880 --> 13:26.200]  that are going to get it
[13:26.200 --> 13:31.120]  let me give you a newsflash you can deliver denial all day you can sit there
[13:31.120 --> 13:36.600]  and and and and say we're making this up or exaggerating but in your gut
[13:36.600 --> 13:41.320]  you know i'm telling you the truth
[13:41.320 --> 13:44.400]  let me tell the cops something let me tell the cps work or something let me
[13:44.400 --> 13:47.280]  tell the government bureaucrats something you think you're gonna ride out
[13:47.280 --> 13:50.280]  the storm and write your tickets and squeeze the public and
[13:50.280 --> 13:53.600]  seize homes and assets and that you're still gonna be taken care of because you
[13:53.600 --> 13:55.160]  work for the government
[13:55.160 --> 13:57.280]  it's called hyperinflation
[13:57.280 --> 14:00.760]  they can even give you a pay raise of five ten percent a year
[14:00.760 --> 14:04.200]  when this stuff really starts hitting and starting to hit now there's nothing
[14:04.200 --> 14:05.840]  you can do
[14:05.840 --> 14:09.200]  you're gonna get hurt by your master's too
[14:09.200 --> 14:13.040]  so don't you worry you're not gonna escape any of it i just want you to know
[14:13.040 --> 14:14.120]  that
[14:14.120 --> 14:17.560]  and you go ahead and roll your sleeve up and take that shot and you go ahead and
[14:17.560 --> 14:22.200]  drink that tap water and you just go ahead and you just laugh at me all day
[14:22.200 --> 14:25.000]  but i've told you nothing about the truth
[14:25.000 --> 14:26.560]  it's disgusting
[14:26.560 --> 14:33.560]  makes me sick to watch everything going to hell in a handbasket
[14:36.200 --> 14:38.560]  i gotta settle down i just can't get mad anymore
[14:38.560 --> 14:42.360]  you know why i'm upset because this depression we're going to have
[14:42.360 --> 14:48.840]  is going to look like road warrior
[14:48.840 --> 14:50.960]  you know i get too close to the problem
[14:50.960 --> 14:54.960]  i get so
[14:54.960 --> 14:56.320]  close to the problem
[14:56.320 --> 15:00.680]  year after year laying out exactly how this would happen exactly how they start
[15:00.680 --> 15:03.880]  the implosion exactly what they do because it's all in i'm at the world
[15:03.880 --> 15:07.240]  bank documents and inside sources we've got inside boulderberg
[15:07.240 --> 15:08.680]  on and on and on
[15:08.680 --> 15:12.720]  studying historical operations what the new orders on in third world countries
[15:12.720 --> 15:15.960]  the same thing they're doing here now we know exactly but not
[15:15.960 --> 15:17.360]  i love to take credit for that
[15:17.360 --> 15:19.160]  it's because it's a confession
[15:19.160 --> 15:26.160]  they tell us exactly how they do it
[15:26.800 --> 15:31.400]  and you know i get intense it is intense that they put
[15:31.400 --> 15:35.440]  hundreds of different toxins and poisons in the water under the name florida
[15:35.440 --> 15:39.720]  and then sodium fluoride itself is deadly but the other stuff's even more deadly
[15:39.720 --> 15:41.920]  it's totally freaky
[15:41.920 --> 15:45.360]  though we've gone from one in thirty three cancer to one in two in men and one
[15:45.360 --> 15:47.360]  in three in women
[15:47.360 --> 15:50.360]  it's totally freaky
[15:50.360 --> 15:53.720]  that there's kids dying all over the neighborhoods all over the places i live
[15:53.720 --> 15:54.480]  of
[15:54.480 --> 15:58.400]  all sorts of leukemia is in cancers when they're three four five years old
[15:58.400 --> 16:01.960]  with no history of it in their family
[16:01.960 --> 16:04.880]  it's just gonna get worse and worse and worse
[16:04.880 --> 16:07.960]  and all these global people
[16:07.960 --> 16:11.440]  who who most of them think they're doing good inside the system have no idea
[16:11.440 --> 16:13.640]  you are manifesting
[16:13.640 --> 16:17.560]  right now
[16:17.560 --> 16:20.880]  so don't tell me about the election i
[16:20.880 --> 16:23.080]  get to vote
[16:23.080 --> 16:25.840]  don't tell me shame on you you're not voting
[16:25.840 --> 16:29.960]  and people say well why are you saying vote then
[16:29.960 --> 16:32.920]  because they don't have fraud in about sixty percent of the country that we
[16:32.920 --> 16:34.800]  know of through the computers
[16:34.800 --> 16:38.360]  they do it the old-fashioned way and it's badly coordinated not complete
[16:38.360 --> 16:40.920]  and i think you should still vote in travis county in austin
[16:40.920 --> 16:44.960]  you should still respond to polls to show it's phony and to have exit polls and
[16:44.960 --> 16:46.240]  we've been doing that locally
[16:46.240 --> 16:49.000]  exposing that there's a fraud
[16:49.000 --> 16:50.760]  i could go on for hours about it
[16:50.760 --> 16:54.200]  how i watch pat Buchanan with about fifty five percent of the vote
[16:54.200 --> 16:55.880]  on the internal computers
[16:55.880 --> 16:58.920]  the times i volunteered down there and i i talked to everybody stacking up the
[16:58.920 --> 17:00.440]  scantron to put a man in
[17:00.440 --> 17:02.720]  it was more than half bubble in for pat Buchanan
[17:02.720 --> 17:07.200]  and when they were done in travis county pat Buchanan got like five percent
[17:07.200 --> 17:09.440]  back in ninety six in the republican primary
[17:09.440 --> 17:16.440]  i've seen it with my eyeballs
[17:17.160 --> 17:18.840]  am i saying give up the fight
[17:18.840 --> 17:22.680]  no i'm saying admit how far down we are on the board
[17:22.680 --> 17:25.040]  instead of all this baloney
[17:25.040 --> 17:26.520]  you may think it's cute
[17:26.520 --> 17:29.000]  that most of food ratings got poison in it
[17:29.000 --> 17:31.880]  you may think it's cute you're shooting your kid up with mercury
[17:31.880 --> 17:35.000]  you may think it's cute they're putting lead narsnik and a hundred other plus
[17:35.000 --> 17:38.040]  things in your water but let me tell you something i don't think it's funny
[17:38.040 --> 17:40.440]  let me explain it's not contaminated water
[17:40.440 --> 17:43.440]  that's just what they're putting in
[17:43.440 --> 17:47.440]  i've seen studies going back over a decade where they're finding
[17:47.440 --> 17:51.440]  the different fluoride compounds that's what
[17:51.440 --> 17:52.760]  prozac is
[17:52.760 --> 17:54.680]  but they're finding serotonin react
[17:54.680 --> 17:57.280]  reuptake inhibitors
[17:57.280 --> 17:59.200]  of prozac and the other
[17:59.200 --> 18:02.240]  fifty-something there are no it's more than that
[18:02.240 --> 18:04.320]  all basically the same attack molecule
[18:04.320 --> 18:08.680]  you're dying feels good getting drunk feels good as brain cells die
[18:08.680 --> 18:11.800]  you better believe in that fluoride molecule
[18:11.800 --> 18:14.080]  uh...
[18:14.080 --> 18:20.400]  all the different things that are added to it feels good
[18:20.400 --> 18:23.920]  you bet what a big cobra bites you right before you die
[18:23.920 --> 18:30.920]  kind of feels good kind of all on that i'm feeling good right now
[18:32.480 --> 18:35.240]  it doesn't matter though you're just going to get big goblets of water and
[18:35.240 --> 18:39.160]  drink it with pleasure i understand you were born to be slaved to the new world
[18:39.160 --> 18:39.920]  order
[18:39.920 --> 18:42.080]  i know it's what you want
[18:42.080 --> 18:45.560]  i understand your powers and so you will deny the fact
[18:45.560 --> 18:48.040]  but it makes me flip out
[18:48.040 --> 18:50.480]  all we got a bunch of big gas coming up today
[18:50.480 --> 18:53.840]  and uh... i want to get into
[18:53.840 --> 18:57.600]  the bailout because i've had a chance to scan over and i've had a scan the chance
[18:57.600 --> 18:59.280]  to read what others uh...
[18:59.280 --> 19:00.120]  who've read it
[19:00.120 --> 19:03.640]  the sections they pointed out i've gone to those sections and indeed
[19:03.640 --> 19:07.800]  it has total complete
[19:07.800 --> 19:09.000]  immunity
[19:09.000 --> 19:11.880]  no oversight
[19:11.880 --> 19:14.680]  it creates fake oversight bodies
[19:14.680 --> 19:16.920]  but those are all under the treasury secretary
[19:16.920 --> 19:19.680]  and so they're just his puppets
[19:19.680 --> 19:23.480]  so before the bill just said no oversight no one can look at it now it is no the
[19:23.480 --> 19:24.640]  treasury secretary
[19:24.640 --> 19:27.640]  he will create three different groups that he runs
[19:27.640 --> 19:33.880]  shared by him
[19:33.880 --> 19:38.160]  but it gives the power to these bastards
[19:38.160 --> 19:40.160]  but let me tell you something
[19:40.160 --> 19:45.880]  the yuppies the soccer moms the spoiled brats the people that
[19:45.880 --> 19:48.600]  beef just grows on trees and and thinks

[24:01.080 --> 24:06.840]  the Genesis Communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[24:06.840 --> 24:11.760]  because there's a war on for your mind
[24:12.840 --> 24:19.080]  if we have a great impression of the magnitude that was started in 1929 and
[24:19.080 --> 24:29.760]  didn't intensify for a full year and peaked in 33-34 it will be a breakdown of
[24:29.760 --> 24:36.320]  society but this is all been engineered by design and we didn't just start
[24:36.320 --> 24:39.880]  saying that this year or last year of the year before this has been the
[24:39.880 --> 24:43.440]  globalist plan all along they do this in third-world countries
[24:43.440 --> 24:49.160]  Joseph Sticklets in late 2001 left the World Bank as their chief economist he
[24:49.160 --> 24:55.360]  resigned then over 2,000 pages of documents were leaked to the media the
[24:55.360 --> 25:01.880]  BBC and a few others carried it in there there is the 100 plus part plan it's
[25:01.880 --> 25:08.600]  109 or 10 I forget the exact number but it's a hundred plus point plan where
[25:08.600 --> 25:12.960]  they go into a third-world country they buy off the government many times in a
[25:12.960 --> 25:17.080]  few years they tell them don't pay it back sign over your infrastructure we're
[25:17.080 --> 25:20.360]  gonna sell derivatives we're gonna inflate your markets then we're going to
[25:20.360 --> 25:24.920]  implode them and we want loss of confidence you then get to retire that is
[25:24.920 --> 25:29.800]  the thugs that run the country who did the takedown operation for the New
[25:29.800 --> 25:34.040]  World Order the central banks they then move to Switzerland New York London
[25:34.040 --> 25:39.320]  those are the main cities but they get private islands in the Bahamas there's
[25:39.320 --> 25:43.560]  thousands of private islands with private security everything and they move
[25:43.560 --> 25:48.240]  out and the country implodes and then as part of the hundred plus point IMF
[25:48.240 --> 25:52.640]  World Bank plan this was secret it's public now for six years we're blessed
[25:52.640 --> 26:00.200]  to have it in the hundred point plan as the economy is imploding see see first
[26:00.200 --> 26:04.440]  first they pump up the currency print a bunch of the currency carry out a bunch
[26:04.440 --> 26:09.960]  of derivatives on the local stock market the the globalists then use use that
[26:09.960 --> 26:16.720]  leveraging to buy up the infrastructure then as part of the IMF World Bank loans
[26:16.720 --> 26:25.360]  they're given the country has to agree to only spend the loans with select
[26:25.360 --> 26:31.280]  fortune 100 companies which themselves are owned by the private central banks
[26:31.280 --> 26:35.400]  so they just give the money back to themselves then agreements have to be
[26:35.400 --> 26:39.600]  signed once the nation starts imploding to sign over more and quote have a
[26:39.600 --> 26:44.480]  governmental bailout which then gets that government and even more fiat made up
[26:44.480 --> 26:48.160]  fraudulent debt to the very bankers that set up the scam and bought off the
[26:48.160 --> 26:56.800]  government internally this is so diabolical are you following me then
[26:56.800 --> 27:02.600]  right when and leading up to this the controlled media in the country says the
[27:02.600 --> 27:06.800]  economy is okay we just need to bail out everything's all right you know the
[27:06.800 --> 27:09.480]  government just needs to issue more currency and more liquidity and we have
[27:09.480 --> 27:12.480]  to hand over more of our national infrastructure to these private
[27:12.480 --> 27:15.680]  corporations that are owned by these private banks but of course that's not
[27:15.680 --> 27:19.280]  told the public they just told we're handing things over this will fix it
[27:19.280 --> 27:23.400]  and then the media comes out and they call it the IMF riot and they even say
[27:23.400 --> 27:28.600]  we create the riot scenario where then they have the president or the
[27:28.600 --> 27:32.200]  parliament and the leaders come out and say it's over we're gonna have a
[27:32.200 --> 27:37.160]  depression unless you bail us out even further so more is signed over to the
[27:37.160 --> 27:42.400]  bankers and more power is given then the bankers have now privatized the
[27:42.400 --> 27:50.680]  water the roads the fuel the energy the media at first they use big government
[27:50.680 --> 27:57.200]  to get control the economy then they sign it over in the next phase and then
[27:57.200 --> 28:02.640]  they fully pull the plug and they stop delivery of food they stop delivery of
[28:02.640 --> 28:09.600]  water they stop delivery of gas a fuel Argentina in 1999 2000 and within
[28:09.600 --> 28:14.720]  weeks well middle-class families are starving in doorways on the streets
[28:14.720 --> 28:19.520]  there are riots and they call it the IMF riot then the police go out ride them
[28:19.520 --> 28:25.120]  down with their horses with clubs with tanks they shoot crowds of people in
[28:25.120 --> 28:29.360]  the streets then all confidence is lost any remaining banks that were owned by
[28:29.360 --> 28:33.320]  the globalist fold there's runs on everything and and the markets
[28:33.320 --> 28:39.160]  dropped to almost zero the bankers buy everything else up and then the nation
[28:39.160 --> 28:43.560]  is fully and totally controlled by the new world order
[28:44.360 --> 28:55.840]  Argentina Guatemala Brazil Nigeria South Africa the list goes on and on
[28:55.840 --> 29:03.880]  hundreds of them scientifically done and make no mistake you can deny what I'm
[29:03.880 --> 29:07.320]  saying and not check into the facts I just gave you you can you can say it's
[29:07.320 --> 29:12.600]  not true it doesn't change it you know I talked to yuppies and businessmen and
[29:12.600 --> 29:15.760]  well-to-do middle-class people and and and they still are in denial they just
[29:15.760 --> 29:19.640]  shake their head they act like me telling them privately and on the
[29:19.640 --> 29:25.600]  street they act like I'm the one doing it because I'm telling him like like
[29:25.600 --> 29:31.240]  like that makes it reality if I say it no no the new world order did all of this
[29:31.240 --> 29:38.680]  and denying it doesn't get you out of it there is a way to defeat them do we
[29:38.680 --> 29:42.680]  have a big enough voice for this show and with our allies and with you the
[29:42.680 --> 29:48.040]  listeners to carry the truth of the people or are they gonna win we'll be

[33:54.160 --> 34:11.960]  in 1815 the banking house of Rothschild was able to get control of the most
[34:11.960 --> 34:18.680]  powerful empire on the planet the British Empire it already had the most
[34:18.680 --> 34:27.520]  wide-reaching world governmental system in existence at that time after it came
[34:27.520 --> 34:37.200]  of course the French the Dutch the Germans the Spanish and the Rothschilds
[34:37.200 --> 34:42.880]  were able to bankrupt England through that war bankrupt Europe then engage in
[34:42.880 --> 34:47.240]  stock market runs which they engineered by putting out the disinformation that
[34:47.240 --> 34:57.080]  Napoleon had won the war about eight hours early they were able to get the
[34:57.080 --> 35:04.520]  word there to the stock exchange in London whose company is controlled
[35:04.520 --> 35:10.580]  international corporations trading across the globe now the bankers had
[35:10.580 --> 35:15.080]  military power they didn't just finance the armies against each other to get
[35:15.080 --> 35:21.680]  financial power they didn't just finance the arms makers they had control the
[35:21.680 --> 35:30.600]  greatest empire the world had ever seen and in 1913 after hundreds of years of
[35:30.600 --> 35:33.720]  trying to assassinate in some cases succeeding and killing presidents and
[35:33.720 --> 35:37.240]  congressional leaders they got their private fellow reserve their income
[35:37.240 --> 35:45.560]  tax they federalized us senators that had been appointed by state legislators to
[35:45.560 --> 35:51.320]  the Congress and they started the task of consolidating the robber baron
[35:51.320 --> 35:56.120]  infrastructure the railroads taking control the states and the territories in
[35:56.120 --> 36:01.200]  the west they turn the United States into a modern empire which the Anglo-
[36:01.200 --> 36:06.880]  American establishment set up as the world currency through the dollar at the
[36:06.880 --> 36:16.600]  end of World War two they used our military our tax money to take over
[36:16.600 --> 36:23.920]  through neocolonialism much of Latin America Asia Africa and areas of
[36:23.920 --> 36:32.680]  Europe and the last nations to be brought down were the middle classes in
[36:32.680 --> 36:39.000]  Europe England Japan and the United States and Canada they systematically
[36:39.000 --> 36:44.200]  this is all public took down Argentina which had the GDP per capita larger than
[36:44.200 --> 36:51.600]  the US had a larger middle class per capita than the United States they are
[36:51.600 --> 36:55.960]  now one of the poorer countries in South America Ted Anderson just had his
[36:55.960 --> 37:05.080]  honeymoon there never been to Buenos Aires and he said he saw just everywhere
[37:05.080 --> 37:12.880]  even the nice parts of town families that look just like Americans living in
[37:12.880 --> 37:22.480]  doorways eight years after the New World Order brought that nation down the
[37:22.480 --> 37:28.480]  Argentines bought into it all national ID cards national fare taxes
[37:28.480 --> 37:35.160]  dollarization they had the very same derivative bubble set up there and they
[37:35.160 --> 37:40.400]  were brought down overnight see that the bankers can create these trillions in
[37:40.400 --> 37:45.720]  fiat currency but they need to trick you into buying into it into going into debt
[37:45.720 --> 37:49.880]  they need to get your government so deep and that it can never get out and now
[37:49.880 --> 37:58.160]  there is over a thousand trillion that's a quadrillion in fiat currency and look
[37:58.160 --> 38:02.960]  I know you understand that I know the general listeners understand that but
[38:02.960 --> 38:07.440]  if we don't explain this to the general public and if we don't get this on
[38:07.440 --> 38:12.120]  blogs and websites and of other news sites don't succinctly report on this
[38:12.120 --> 38:18.880]  and explain this we need to I know it's on prison planet TV but we need to take
[38:18.880 --> 38:24.240]  that final chapter and repost it and in fact it was an article a transcript we
[38:24.240 --> 38:34.800]  put together part of the article is IMF World Bank documents consume Argentina
[38:34.800 --> 38:42.040]  was the strange headline that Greg Paulist gave it he took a transcript
[38:42.040 --> 38:44.800]  listener dead of the interview he did here for some reason you know he was
[38:44.800 --> 38:47.880]  reporting on others reporting on never got any global traction he came on this
[38:47.880 --> 38:53.360]  show he wrote a testimonial about it even asked for and and and he got
[38:53.360 --> 39:02.760]  published over 500 newspapers from Italy to Japan to all over Europe IMF World
[39:02.760 --> 39:08.800]  Bank documents consume Argentina was another headline put out under it
[39:08.800 --> 39:18.160]  consume Venezuela with interest I mean no one six years ago had put together
[39:18.160 --> 39:23.280]  what the IMF World Bank said they were doing the gunboat diplomacy and how
[39:23.280 --> 39:28.360]  this works if if there was a leader in Guatemala or a leader in some other
[39:28.360 --> 39:33.240]  country and in Africa who got control and said look we're not gonna pay this
[39:33.240 --> 39:37.480]  fake debt back and you can see the examples of where there'd be a three
[39:37.480 --> 39:43.760]  billion dollar IMF loan say in 1980 to this is hypothetical the numbers are
[39:43.760 --> 39:48.040]  similar go look up the years for yourself remember the exact numbers it was
[39:48.040 --> 39:52.000]  something like 1982 there was a three billion dollar IMF World Bank loan to
[39:52.000 --> 40:02.640]  Nigeria and they've paid back something like 60 billion on the three billion
[40:02.640 --> 40:12.000]  dollar loan I mean what a fraud and it's upwards now in compounded interest of
[40:12.000 --> 40:19.040]  over 30% a year if you think the international bankers want you having a
[40:19.040 --> 40:21.960]  nice house on the swimming pool and going on three vacations a year and
[40:21.960 --> 40:27.720]  driving nice cars be able to put your children in private schools you know
[40:27.720 --> 40:31.440]  lower middle class people can do that if the husband and wife both worked and
[40:31.440 --> 40:35.640]  Americans got tricked into that back in the 60s oh you want to live the really
[40:35.640 --> 40:40.000]  good life you know now we can tax both the man and the woman and then now you
[40:40.000 --> 40:46.560]  both work and you don't get to see your children and the states raising them all
[40:46.560 --> 40:50.880]  scientifically engineered and everybody's complaining and griping and
[40:50.880 --> 40:55.640]  saying you know I don't eat out anymore and and and I buy the cheapest stuff at
[40:55.640 --> 41:00.480]  the grocery store and I I don't ever get a vacation anymore and I work two jobs
[41:00.480 --> 41:04.240]  and just five six years ago I was working one job and living better than
[41:04.240 --> 41:11.640]  this and I make is more money now but I can't live on it well that's because
[41:11.640 --> 41:16.800]  you've had compounded at 10% inflation on average for the last six years in a
[41:16.800 --> 41:20.840]  row and that's top economist on the show I mean it was you know six years ago it
[41:20.840 --> 41:25.000]  was only 7% and then it was 8% and 9 and 10 and 12 the averaging together it's
[41:25.000 --> 41:28.920]  about 10% in the last six years compounded every year well let me see
[41:28.920 --> 41:32.880]  five six years depending on how you look at the numbers five six years of 10%
[41:32.880 --> 41:40.680]  inflation what is that that's 50 to 60% devaluation in your paycheck or in
[41:40.680 --> 41:47.760]  your fixed income on social security or pension now you see but the media wouldn't
[41:47.760 --> 41:51.800]  tell you that they would have headlines about it's a conspiracy theory that we
[41:51.800 --> 41:55.520]  have high inflation and they'd have a nice guy in a suit or an info babe
[41:55.520 --> 41:59.480]  licking her lips and smacking them looking at you smiling talking about how
[41:59.480 --> 42:03.240]  great things are up until about a year ago
[42:06.200 --> 42:11.960]  and this is all just the organized collapse this is this is all about the
[42:11.960 --> 42:18.520]  the false story the the false download the false hologram is I guess max
[42:18.520 --> 42:27.920]  kaiser would put it economist this is the this is the the projection as I would
[42:27.920 --> 42:34.480]  put it all it was some greedy white trash in an evil minorities that's
[42:34.480 --> 42:39.120]  basically what's being said they they lied on applications
[42:39.120 --> 42:43.920]  oh really that's less than a hundred billion dollars that whole things are
[42:43.920 --> 42:47.960]  less than a hundred billion it has nothing to do with the derivatives it has
[42:47.960 --> 42:57.680]  nothing to do with all the instruments and the one thousand trillion plus but
[42:57.680 --> 43:01.640]  you need to you see in the history books with what's coming you need to know
[43:01.640 --> 43:09.440]  it's your fault and they have lots of little corporate culture shills on radio
[43:09.440 --> 43:13.000]  they love repeating what the big wigs said they love thinking they're in the
[43:13.000 --> 43:16.360]  know and the yuppies are all crowded around the establishment thinking that
[43:16.360 --> 43:19.960]  they just get behind all the bailouts in the parroting and the going along with
[43:19.960 --> 43:24.280]  the false paradigm that they're gonna be all right they're gonna be okay hey
[43:24.280 --> 43:28.480]  listen you're not gonna be okay until you admit there's a predatory new world
[43:28.480 --> 43:32.560]  order until you admit this is a global meltdown of our economy meant to bring
[43:32.560 --> 43:38.920]  us into depression and rioting for a pretext for martial law civil emergency
[43:38.920 --> 43:48.040]  and for a re monetization of the debt through the amaro bringing in new
[43:48.040 --> 43:52.600]  markets to leverage new scams and then finally into a new world order global
[43:52.600 --> 43:58.680]  hegemon run by the Rothschild Rockefeller banking axis out of the city of
[43:58.680 --> 44:09.600]  London in London that is the facts now we told you for years that as soon as
[44:09.600 --> 44:17.160]  they started the implosion the real implosion which we're gonna see very
[44:17.160 --> 44:21.720]  soon they're just setting up things right now that you would hear them say
[44:21.720 --> 44:27.120]  this oh we've got some expert bankers that we need to have a world agreement
[44:27.120 --> 44:29.600]  because this is because this system's gonna what's happening with the
[44:29.600 --> 44:31.760]  derivatives is gonna bring down the world markets already happen
[44:31.760 --> 44:36.440]  euro's already plunging it's inflated to so a currency plunging is inflation
[44:36.440 --> 44:45.520]  it's plunging in value and then oh it's a global crisis the central bankers are
[44:45.520 --> 44:49.320]  all working together yeah because it's the same group of families less than 20
[44:49.320 --> 44:57.080]  really only about three or four but there's a lower row of power elite they're
[44:57.080 --> 45:04.120]  all married it's like a breed we're dealing with these people are all
[45:04.120 --> 45:11.160]  related and they are now going to sack the world economy and then poses
[45:11.160 --> 45:17.440]  saviors the entire time granting to themselves Gert world government power
[45:17.440 --> 45:23.280]  outside of governments if you read all the proposals for world taxes and world
[45:23.280 --> 45:27.680]  regulations and world carbon taxes which they now are saying publicly it was
[45:27.680 --> 45:31.200]  only in policy reports decades ago they're now saying oh well we'll use
[45:31.200 --> 45:42.160]  carbon taxes and the green revolution and carbon regulations we'll use that as
[45:42.160 --> 45:46.280]  a new market and a new growing market that that that's code to those that know
[45:46.280 --> 45:49.680]  they'd have code on TV for those that actually are in the know that are
[45:49.680 --> 45:54.640]  working with the system but then for the dumbbells don't understand it you know a
[45:54.640 --> 45:59.000]  new market a new financial system to expand into that means to keep the
[45:59.000 --> 46:04.200]  leveraging going to a new bubble so bush called it was a bubble neck he says oh
[46:04.200 --> 46:12.000]  everything's fine the last year and a half we just had a bubble neck and so
[46:12.000 --> 46:18.480]  now they're proposing their their world financial system where the governments
[46:18.480 --> 46:22.680]  England the United States Europe Germany's already been captured a long
[46:22.680 --> 46:28.320]  time ago our governments already do with the bankers say they already when the
[46:28.320 --> 46:31.040]  fellow reserve says jump with the Bank of England says jump the private banks
[46:31.040 --> 46:35.840]  they say how high boss how high master and they get that the other they get
[46:35.840 --> 46:42.560]  down their knees and and and frustrate themselves but now even the illusion of
[46:42.560 --> 46:47.040]  having a government the Congress the president the courts their rubber
[46:47.040 --> 46:52.960]  stamps and through the crisis they created they now fool the Congress through
[46:52.960 --> 46:58.000]  economic terrorism in the public they're not even really fooling most of Congress
[46:58.000 --> 47:01.160]  they've all bought into it they see as a foregone conclusion to sign all the
[47:01.160 --> 47:06.920]  authority over to them and openly make the bankers government openly give them
[47:06.920 --> 47:13.600]  governmental power we're seeing a revolution here we're seeing something as
[47:13.600 --> 47:20.240]  big as the Declaration of Independence being set up July 4th 1776 but it's not
[47:20.240 --> 47:25.800]  a good thing that's happening it's an evil revolution that means people are
[47:25.800 --> 47:31.720]  proud of themselves this is conquering this is financial military precision
[47:31.720 --> 47:42.240]  this is a scorched earth total domination global domination in everyone's
[47:42.240 --> 47:52.000]  face for all the world to see and so what is the solution well first off no
[47:52.000 --> 47:56.640]  radio show tells it like it is like this one and has the momentum and the
[47:56.640 --> 48:00.720]  listenership not just of the general public millions every day tune in on the
[48:00.720 --> 48:07.040]  MNFM international satellite conservatively it's over two million but
[48:07.040 --> 48:11.200]  we have a lot of important people globally in government outside government
[48:11.200 --> 48:14.400]  corporations a lot of good people that are in the system that know it's bad and
[48:14.400 --> 48:18.600]  who want to come out who are leaking our information and passing it around in the
[48:18.600 --> 48:24.920]  important board rooms and government redoubts where they operate at great
[48:24.920 --> 48:34.920]  risk to themselves we bring you the best guess the most important information we
[48:34.920 --> 48:39.240]  are the best chink in the dragon's armor of where a few little scales are
[48:39.240 --> 48:44.280]  missing on his iron high their little pink soft belly and that's what this
[48:44.280 --> 48:47.840]  radio show is he's missing some other scales here and there and more of his
[48:47.840 --> 48:51.120]  scales are falling off because he's crushing and attacking and dominating
[48:51.120 --> 48:55.800]  and he's in war right now he's getting hit by arrows and by catapults and you
[48:55.800 --> 48:58.640]  know he's crushing nights that come up to facing you know governments that
[48:58.640 --> 49:02.440]  threaten them but still you know he the dragon's bleeding and there's this big
[49:02.440 --> 49:10.360]  open patch on the belly and that's what this radio show is and so I need you to
[49:10.360 --> 49:14.200]  tell your whole email list your myspace everybody that's why the government
[49:14.200 --> 49:17.560]  they're going tell pro and their disinformation officers poses patriots
[49:17.560 --> 49:22.120]  and attack this show many of them admitted operatives and then many
[49:22.120 --> 49:25.880]  copycats that are mentally ill and pick up on it are weak-minded you know we're
[49:25.880 --> 49:29.680]  trained in fight with each other by them by the New World Order from birth the
[49:29.680 --> 49:32.320]  point is that's why they want to discredit me and attack me because they
[49:32.320 --> 49:36.480]  understand that if they kill me it'll make me a martyr so they don't want to do
[49:36.480 --> 49:41.240]  that I live a pretty clean life so it's hard to set me up or discredit me I've
[49:41.240 --> 49:44.160]  isolated myself from people so it's hard for them to get their infiltrators in
[49:44.160 --> 49:51.120]  here believe me they've tried and so that's why you can tell this show is so
[49:51.120 --> 49:55.320]  effective by the fruits it bears and by the fact that it's so attacked so ignore
[49:55.320 --> 49:59.840]  those attacks move forward telling your email list telling other people telling
[49:59.840 --> 50:04.440]  calling to talk shows about info wars dot com about prison planet dot com the
[50:04.440 --> 50:09.600]  fact the show restreams 24 hours a day but now we post up there every day the
[50:09.600 --> 50:16.000]  show just to be played off of a flash player the full four hours we're
[50:16.000 --> 50:20.000]  creating an archive of that the video streams we do in the third and fourth
[50:20.000 --> 50:24.240]  hours some days the whole show some as part of the show it's up to you to take
[50:24.240 --> 50:29.600]  the live feed we do we don't have the personnel and rejump it up to your own
[50:29.600 --> 50:36.840]  justin TV channel or to the other channels that are out there I mean you

[56:26.480 --> 56:29.520]  hostile with young women having their teeth ripped out and the giggle and
[56:29.520 --> 56:35.920]  smirk and get off on it so see when it really happens them in real life
[56:35.920 --> 56:42.800]  nobody's gonna care because it's beautiful a dirty bag of ashes and dirt
[56:42.800 --> 56:47.080]  and maggots is beautiful to them and they're gonna turn the world into what

[56:55.760 --> 57:01.680]  fact that you don't do what they say they're gonna kill you now the good
[57:01.680 --> 57:05.280]  news is enough of those cops children and families are getting sick from the
[57:05.280 --> 57:09.280]  vaccines and the food to know we're telling the truth so now they're growing
[57:09.280 --> 57:14.640]  up a little bit enough the military has seen the evil to wake up so they're
[57:14.640 --> 57:18.920]  kicking them out and hiring illegal aliens and aggravated felons but that
[57:18.920 --> 57:26.080]  won't go over very well so I want to make it clear to everybody out there the
[57:26.080 --> 57:29.680]  people have heard us tell the truth for decades they know the patriot movement
[57:29.680 --> 57:33.160]  the truth movement whatever you want to call it the alternative media has done a
[57:33.160 --> 57:39.160]  great job on average our credibility is extremely high and a lot of you were
[57:39.160 --> 57:43.480]  laughed at as you planted seeds years ago those seeds have now sprouted see
[57:43.480 --> 57:47.080]  can sprout a hundred years later seeds were planted hundreds of years ago are
[57:47.080 --> 57:51.160]  just now sprouting and seeds you planted a month ago are now sprouting and so
[57:51.160 --> 57:54.880]  speaking out getting the word out standing up against evil standing up
[57:54.880 --> 57:59.440]  against corruption now is having the biggest payback in liberty and freedom
[57:59.440 --> 58:04.320]  and minds unlocked and we don't have a choice the New World Order is not gonna
[58:04.320 --> 58:12.520]  give any of us quarter they're waging war against all of us even those of you
[58:12.520 --> 58:19.920]  that serve them that's most often even more so on and so I tell you now you
[58:19.920 --> 58:23.640]  better not procrastinate and sit on the bench a lot of people sit on the bench
[58:23.640 --> 58:26.520]  trying to figure out some perfect plan to fight the New World Order some big
[58:26.520 --> 58:29.800]  fancy thing they're gonna do and they never do it no put simple things in the

[1:01:36.760 --> 1:01:41.520]  weeks ago Nobel Prize winner but Andrew you've got the floor I mean break down
[1:01:41.520 --> 1:01:45.960]  my listeners know the basics and some of more but what's happening that can you
[1:01:45.960 --> 1:01:49.680]  know the implosion what the elite is engaged in what's happening with the
[1:01:49.680 --> 1:01:53.360]  bailouts and where you see us going in the future oh wait a minute Alex before
[1:01:53.360 --> 1:01:59.640]  I go there first of all you my friend are I can't even put this into words
[1:01:59.640 --> 1:02:04.680]  talk about my hero man you and your megaphone have done more good for this
[1:02:04.680 --> 1:02:10.140]  movement in the last five years and then I have in 25 just beating the bushes so
[1:02:10.140 --> 1:02:14.240]  I appreciate your kind words but man I send them all right back to you and I'm
[1:02:14.240 --> 1:02:19.320]  so honored to be here I can't even tell you well we know you're a busy guy you're
[1:02:19.320 --> 1:02:23.880]  all over TV all over radio more than ever because you are on target I mean
[1:02:23.880 --> 1:02:27.800]  break down you talk to us like we're six years old like the government
[1:02:27.800 --> 1:02:32.280]  turret said yesterday for the new listeners and then let's break down how
[1:02:32.280 --> 1:02:37.160]  we got here and where we're going okay Federal Reserve Bank of New York lead
[1:02:37.160 --> 1:02:40.400]  bank in the cartel and I know your listeners are real familiar because
[1:02:40.400 --> 1:02:44.720]  you've done a great job of educating them they basically have about 12 private
[1:02:44.720 --> 1:02:48.960]  banks that control the issuance of money in this country but the one in New
[1:02:48.960 --> 1:02:55.000]  York has allowed for the creation of $3 in debt for every dollar in
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:03:00.560]  circulation so they have created this time bomb if you will that's facing the
[1:03:00.560 --> 1:03:04.680]  United States today I would lay it all solely at the feet of the Federal Reserve
[1:03:04.680 --> 1:03:09.280]  Bank of New York and I strongly urge Congress and the Senate to take over
[1:03:09.280 --> 1:03:15.640]  that institution nationalize it but keep going yeah I mean you know with it
[1:03:15.640 --> 1:03:19.800]  seems absurd to me that we're going to take $700 billion in Treasury money
[1:03:19.800 --> 1:03:24.120]  we're going to write a bond I owe you $700 billion that we're going to hand it
[1:03:24.120 --> 1:03:27.800]  over to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York they're going to create $700
[1:03:27.800 --> 1:03:31.680]  billion hand it back to the Treasury and then the Treasury Secretary is going
[1:03:31.680 --> 1:03:35.960]  to dole that out to the owners of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York what a
[1:03:35.960 --> 1:03:41.880]  big circle if instead we nationalize the Fed and just take the 700 billion put it
[1:03:41.880 --> 1:03:45.640]  right on their balance sheet run it right out of the Treasury a we're going
[1:03:45.640 --> 1:03:50.600]  to save $35 billion in annual interest payments on the 700 and be every bit of
[1:03:50.600 --> 1:03:55.120]  profit that they get from now on we'll go back to repaying this $10 trillion in
[1:03:55.120 --> 1:03:59.160]  debt that they've settled us well as you know several hundred economists were in
[1:03:59.160 --> 1:04:03.200]  a story on Bloomberg last week that they cited saying it's more like five
[1:04:03.200 --> 1:04:07.080]  trillion that's the consensus they're now saying it's 800 and something
[1:04:07.080 --> 1:04:13.280]  billion now today so from your research what's the real number on the stick up
[1:04:13.280 --> 1:04:18.480]  known as the bailout well I show total assets total debt outstanding of 45
[1:04:18.480 --> 1:04:23.160]  trillion against the money supply of 14 trillion that leaves us assured is
[1:04:23.160 --> 1:04:27.360]  around 31 trillion dollars that's a very conservative number the Dallas
[1:04:27.360 --> 1:04:34.040]  Morning News said four years ago that it was 41 trillion right now using that
[1:04:34.040 --> 1:04:39.080]  metric that magic expansion of money that they do the 700 billion they can
[1:04:39.080 --> 1:04:44.560]  easily turn into seven trillion which will allow them to multiply actually you
[1:04:44.560 --> 1:04:48.800]  know every dollar ten times well let's break that down because again we have
[1:04:48.800 --> 1:04:53.280]  so many listeners hundreds of thousands every day millions already on board with
[1:04:53.280 --> 1:04:55.680]  what's happening but you've got a lot of ideas for solutions
[1:04:55.680 --> 1:05:00.480]  Andrew Gauss is our guest Andrew Gauss dot com we'll be right back
[1:05:00.480 --> 1:05:05.640]  a day unlike any other in the long course of American history a terrorist act of

[1:08:43.760 --> 1:08:48.600]  over his bio would take a few hours but but let's start over now because a few
[1:08:48.600 --> 1:08:52.040]  stations just joined us tell us about yourself your history and then let's
[1:08:52.040 --> 1:08:58.080]  recap the basics of who the private banking cartel are what they've created
[1:08:58.080 --> 1:09:03.840]  what they're up to in this new system they're bringing us into go through that
[1:09:03.840 --> 1:09:08.280]  for us sir okay you know basically I'm just a paper boy I started delivering
[1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:12.520]  papers in the mid-60s when they took the silver out of our coins and I started to
[1:09:12.520 --> 1:09:15.840]  notice the difference like one of my quarters was worth 25 cents and the
[1:09:15.840 --> 1:09:19.760]  other one was worth 50 cents so I started putting away all the quarters
[1:09:19.760 --> 1:09:26.040]  dimes and halfs that were made before 1964 and by 1980 I had saved enough money
[1:09:26.040 --> 1:09:30.880]  to put myself in business and and I've been doing that ever since I started
[1:09:30.880 --> 1:09:35.480]  writing about how this all happens because I found it fascinating I was
[1:09:35.480 --> 1:09:39.840]  always taught that Constitution no state shall make anything but gold or silver
[1:09:39.840 --> 1:09:43.600]  coin at tender and payment of debt I didn't understand how we were getting
[1:09:43.600 --> 1:09:47.560]  around that so as I started to study the subject it was like how it was like
[1:09:47.560 --> 1:09:51.400]  pulling on a cheat on a thread on a cheap suit you know the more you pull the
[1:09:51.400 --> 1:09:55.680]  more it just becomes unraveled and and that's really what led me to the Federal
[1:09:55.680 --> 1:10:00.960]  Reserve Bank of New York the the Fed of New York is the lead bank in this cartel
[1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:07.760]  that was established in 1913 and using the reference of Senate report 93-549
[1:10:07.760 --> 1:10:13.080]  for you scholars out there you can see that in the period from 1913 to 1933
[1:10:13.080 --> 1:10:17.600]  the Federal Reserve did exactly what the charlatans before them did is they
[1:10:17.600 --> 1:10:22.960]  printed more notes for money gold and silver coin than they actually had gold
[1:10:22.960 --> 1:10:27.000]  and silver coin to back them up and it's key to explain that early on and I
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:29.400]  want you to go over this because this is you know this is what you do your
[1:10:29.400 --> 1:10:34.280]  historian in this early on when they start issuing more currency than there
[1:10:34.280 --> 1:10:38.000]  is gold and silver the public doesn't catch on and so there isn't as much as
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:41.920]  inflation at first and so they can print money and get real gold and silver and
[1:10:41.920 --> 1:10:46.880]  then they can go buy real assets with it and then leave the the public holding the
[1:10:46.880 --> 1:10:50.840]  bag of that's the key to all this indeed that was the model actually we should
[1:10:50.840 --> 1:10:54.720]  probably start before the Federal Reserve Act you know in the 1870s 1880s
[1:10:54.720 --> 1:10:58.880]  guys would go out into the middle of the woods and they would put you know ten
[1:10:58.880 --> 1:11:03.040]  twenty dollar gold pieces in a vault in a log cabin and then they would issue a
[1:11:03.040 --> 1:11:07.960]  hundred twenty dollar bills and anyone who had to try to redeem those bills had
[1:11:07.960 --> 1:11:12.840]  to fight their way through the woods and fight wildcats hence the name wildcat
[1:11:12.840 --> 1:11:17.960]  bank so this model of creating more notes than you had gold and silver and then
[1:11:17.960 --> 1:11:22.200]  using the notes to buy things before anyone realized what had happened this
[1:11:22.200 --> 1:11:27.160]  was a tried-and-true model and the Fed decided to simply nationalize this idea
[1:11:27.160 --> 1:11:31.560]  and and to give us a uniform currency in the balance and they deceptively now
[1:11:31.560 --> 1:11:35.480]  because they actually finance communism as a way to consolidate and enslave
[1:11:35.480 --> 1:11:40.040]  populations we get into that later you to control the paradigm of false left
[1:11:40.040 --> 1:11:45.480]  right paradigm now they're blaming capitalism and say this is capitalism
[1:11:45.480 --> 1:11:50.240]  when all this is a Ponzi scheme fraud absolutely right that's the best way to
[1:11:50.240 --> 1:11:54.920]  characterize it because using that same Senate report you can see in 1913 and
[1:11:54.920 --> 1:12:00.440]  1914 if someone took a San Francisco Federal Reserve note and brought it to
[1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:05.040]  New York the golden silver coin would come flying over the counter in those
[1:12:05.040 --> 1:12:08.520]  first few years they built real confidence in the system in fact everyone
[1:12:08.520 --> 1:12:12.000]  thought we hit a home run because we didn't have any of those wildcat banks
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  anymore now you knew a dollar in New York was a dollar in San Francisco was a
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:20.240]  dollar anywhere in the country so they really brought stability and trust to
[1:12:20.240 --> 1:12:24.360]  the system and it had been lacking for a long time so for all through the teens
[1:12:24.360 --> 1:12:29.320]  13 14 15 16 they were actually duplicating every bond that they had
[1:12:29.320 --> 1:12:33.160]  and sending as an identical amount of money over to England so that they
[1:12:33.160 --> 1:12:38.240]  could prosecute that war over there which Wilson kept us out of in reality
[1:12:38.240 --> 1:12:41.960]  the American people had no idea that this was going on and we were given
[1:12:41.960 --> 1:12:46.120]  instead the roaring 20s and that's why they roared because as soon as the war
[1:12:46.120 --> 1:12:50.240]  was over all of that money came back and started competing here at home for
[1:12:50.240 --> 1:12:53.800]  goods and services this was when the fraud of the Federal Reserve was first
[1:12:53.800 --> 1:12:58.120]  revealed and the banks responded by taking all of the golden silver out of
[1:12:58.120 --> 1:13:02.960]  circulation so that by the time the crash at 29 came the only thing left were
[1:13:02.960 --> 1:13:07.120]  these paper notes these Federal Reserve notes without any means to back them up
[1:13:07.120 --> 1:13:12.920]  now again that's key they were able to use globalization to hide the fact that
[1:13:12.920 --> 1:13:18.760]  they were inflating the currency not here domestically but overseas the same
[1:13:18.760 --> 1:13:23.360]  thing they've been doing now but it's rushing back just like it did at the end
[1:13:23.360 --> 1:13:28.160]  of World War one but this time the crisis is many times worse and magnitude
[1:13:28.160 --> 1:13:32.200]  indeed the lessons that they learned from World War one they applied in World
[1:13:32.200 --> 1:13:36.400]  War two and you know it was like a replay of the same game only this time
[1:13:36.400 --> 1:13:40.000]  they were going to put into action what they learned and that was that you could
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:44.320]  hide this inflation around the world if you could convince other nations to
[1:13:44.320 --> 1:13:49.120]  start using the dollar as their unit of measure so out we went now into World
[1:13:49.120 --> 1:13:53.600]  War two before we rushed there though let's talk the crash at 29 they get
[1:13:53.600 --> 1:13:57.680]  Congress together in 29 they say okay what caused all this well people kept
[1:13:57.680 --> 1:14:00.760]  going to the bank asking for gold there was enough gold okay first thing we'll
[1:14:00.760 --> 1:14:04.600]  do let's stop the people from asking for gold anymore so that was the first
[1:14:04.600 --> 1:14:08.080]  thing we're not going to make these notes redeemable for gold second thing
[1:14:08.080 --> 1:14:11.720]  we're going to make the investment banks separate from the commercial banks you
[1:14:11.720 --> 1:14:15.800]  either gather up money from rich people and invest in things that's an
[1:14:15.800 --> 1:14:19.800]  investment bank or you gather up deposits from regular people and make
[1:14:19.800 --> 1:14:23.320]  loans to regular people that's a commercial bank and one was never
[1:14:23.320 --> 1:14:28.120]  supposed to mix with the other it stayed that way until 1999 Alex and on the way
[1:14:28.120 --> 1:14:31.840]  out Bill Clinton kind of signed that legislation that took down that barrier
[1:14:31.840 --> 1:14:37.440]  and suddenly JP Morgan was buying chase and city group was buying travelers and
[1:14:37.440 --> 1:14:41.520]  they started mixing these businesses together so that this delusion could
[1:14:41.520 --> 1:14:46.240]  occur without Americans realizing what was going on into World War two again
[1:14:46.240 --> 1:14:51.240]  we come out of World War two where the victors instead of demanding reparations
[1:14:51.240 --> 1:14:55.120]  like everyone else did we get together at a conference called Bretton Woods and
[1:14:55.120 --> 1:14:58.760]  we say okay we're going to rebuild Europe we're going to fix the world there's
[1:14:58.760 --> 1:15:04.080]  only one thing we want from everyone and that is that you price oil in dollars
[1:15:04.080 --> 1:15:09.000]  and no matter where anyone buys oil in the entire world it's priced in dollars
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:13.440]  now this gave them that mechanism to create every time somebody both pulled a
[1:15:13.440 --> 1:15:16.840]  barrel of oil out of the ground they were free to create the corresponding
[1:15:16.840 --> 1:15:21.880]  amount of money and to this day 80% of all the world's trade is conducted in
[1:15:21.880 --> 1:15:26.680]  dollars and that enables them to hide the inflation overseas and I'll tell you
[1:15:26.680 --> 1:15:30.240]  those foreign investors are getting sick of it they're starting to disgorge
[1:15:30.240 --> 1:15:34.200]  themselves from dollars and that won't be pretty now again some people will say
[1:15:34.200 --> 1:15:40.160]  well yes this is a fiat system and the elite banks did it but look how good it
[1:15:40.160 --> 1:15:44.120]  is for America the you know this country before we had this current scam being
[1:15:44.120 --> 1:15:48.160]  nationwide had 10% growth rates on average every year not 3% that they
[1:15:48.160 --> 1:15:54.600]  call roaring and that 3% really negative if you count in the real inflation not
[1:15:54.600 --> 1:15:58.080]  the cooked inflation but the big problem is it gave these predatory banking
[1:15:58.080 --> 1:16:03.760]  families unlimited power to buy up everything and create monopolies which
[1:16:03.760 --> 1:16:07.880]  they've now done yeah I always go back to that Jefferson quote on that subject
[1:16:07.880 --> 1:16:12.320]  he said if we ever allowed banks to control the issue of our currency that
[1:16:12.320 --> 1:16:16.240]  they would set up corporations that would eventually deprive us of all of our
[1:16:16.240 --> 1:16:21.320]  property and that's exactly what they've done if you look at the money that
[1:16:21.320 --> 1:16:25.000]  they've taken from the banking system money that they've created out of thin
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:28.840]  air and then bought every critical industry and they started with the
[1:16:28.840 --> 1:16:33.360]  newspapers they ended with television they bought everything in between all
[1:16:33.360 --> 1:16:36.880]  the critical industry in the United States anything that manufactures
[1:16:36.880 --> 1:16:42.160]  anything that creates money casinos you name the manufacturing industry or the
[1:16:42.160 --> 1:16:46.080]  industry that creates or gathers money and it's infiltrated and controlled by
[1:16:46.080 --> 1:16:50.080]  the same people that own and control the Federal Reserve Bank how could they not
[1:16:50.080 --> 1:16:55.960]  take over when they control the issuance of currency and credit and when they
[1:16:55.960 --> 1:17:00.160]  regulate themselves exactly I asked people if I gave you the power to write
[1:17:00.160 --> 1:17:04.800]  checks that no one ever has the power to cash they only have to accept them as
[1:17:04.800 --> 1:17:08.600]  money how many would you write when would you stop I would just might get
[1:17:08.600 --> 1:17:14.000]  writers cramped from buying if I had that power I would own Austin Texas in a
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:17.120]  year I'd come to a house and say what do you want for your house well the house
[1:17:17.120 --> 1:17:20.560]  is really worth 500,000 I don't want to sell it I'll give you a million sold or
[1:17:20.560 --> 1:17:26.600]  I mean it is just unlimited and now really since the 80s since the mid 90s
[1:17:26.600 --> 1:17:29.600]  since they were gonna just go from fractional reserve to unlimited
[1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:34.840]  leveraging they went to flat out corruption CIA Delta Force coming in
[1:17:34.840 --> 1:17:38.640]  with bags of cash buying off local government officials because they know
[1:17:38.640 --> 1:17:43.600]  the collapse is coming and they they plan to use a police state to protect
[1:17:43.600 --> 1:17:47.520]  their system and make sure they win to enforce it yeah you know I one of the
[1:17:47.520 --> 1:17:51.680]  things that I bring up that highlights all of this really it draws at home is
[1:17:51.680 --> 1:17:56.440]  that if you had a dollar in 1980 it's best expressed as a fraction it's one
[1:17:56.440 --> 1:18:02.080]  over one trillion and by 1995 the total supply of money had grown from one
[1:18:02.080 --> 1:18:06.520]  trillion to nearly five trillion so now your dollar was one over five trillion
[1:18:06.520 --> 1:18:11.520]  today there are 14 trillion dollars in circulation so your dollar is now one
[1:18:11.520 --> 1:18:16.080]  over 14 trillion you can see the progression there there's 14 times as
[1:18:16.080 --> 1:18:21.920]  much money in circulation today as there was in 1980 and then claims for three
[1:18:21.920 --> 1:18:27.000]  times that amount that's what's causing this freeze up right now so in reality
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:33.880]  the dollar of today is worth one forty fifth of a dollar from 1980 that's got
[1:18:33.880 --> 1:18:37.240]  to be reflected in prices and that's why I think the wave of inflation that's
[1:18:37.240 --> 1:18:41.920]  coming is going to make all the others look pale well mainline economists and
[1:18:41.920 --> 1:18:46.360]  historians like yourself they come on the show and they all agree and really
[1:18:46.360 --> 1:18:50.400]  it's the majority of real economists agree they just don't get put on TV as
[1:18:50.400 --> 1:18:53.480]  often as the people that are quote wrong they're not really wrong they're just
[1:18:53.480 --> 1:18:57.400]  lying they're not stupid either but they all come on and say this isn't gonna
[1:18:57.400 --> 1:19:03.480]  look like 29 inflation or the roaring 20s inflation this is gonna look like
[1:19:03.480 --> 1:19:08.720]  Weimar Republic right it's actually gonna dwarf for Weimar Republic be if in
[1:19:08.720 --> 1:19:13.440]  fact all of those debt claims are turned into money and this is the key here is
[1:19:13.440 --> 1:19:18.240]  that what level the Federal Reserve decides to monetize this debt or turn
[1:19:18.240 --> 1:19:24.280]  the debt instrument into a current dollar and it is that lack of oversight you
[1:19:24.280 --> 1:19:28.200]  know this is my main criticism of the Fed in New York we might not be able to
[1:19:28.200 --> 1:19:33.160]  abolish the Fed we might not be able to regulate it but by God we could sure take
[1:19:33.160 --> 1:19:40.000]  it over and that's the drumbeat we need because if we're going to quote bail
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:43.440]  this out which is really just signing over dictatorial power to him and being
[1:19:43.440 --> 1:19:48.320]  suckered even deeper well then why shouldn't the government own it but see
[1:19:48.320 --> 1:19:52.320]  the public still thinks the Federal Reserve is the government so we're
[1:19:52.320 --> 1:19:56.720]  gonna talk to monetary historian just an amazing individual more on history and
[1:19:56.720 --> 1:19:59.960]  where he sees things going in the future what should happen versus what
[1:19:59.960 --> 1:20:04.280]  they're gonna do would you like to know how you can use water as fuel and laugh
[1:20:04.280 --> 1:20:08.600]  at the rising price of gas then keep listening for a very special offer gas

[1:24:26.400 --> 1:24:30.240]  in a lot here you you've covered some of the basic history my big question for
[1:24:30.240 --> 1:24:34.360]  you studying these people is from the IMF and World Bank documents I talked so
[1:24:34.360 --> 1:24:40.560]  much about and sticklets and their past history and third world countries what
[1:24:40.560 --> 1:24:49.120]  we see here in the western world and the United States and Japan appears to be
[1:24:49.120 --> 1:24:54.680]  done by design to consolidate it because we know they've done in the past we
[1:24:54.680 --> 1:24:57.640]  infiltrated Bilderberg group almost three years ago they said they would start
[1:24:57.640 --> 1:25:06.200]  the implosion by restricting loans in subprime to blame on the public and so
[1:25:06.200 --> 1:25:10.960]  we've been on target with that so really I know they're orchestrating it the only
[1:25:10.960 --> 1:25:14.760]  question is are they losing control because I have seen some of their people
[1:25:14.760 --> 1:25:21.240]  in the financial times of London come out and say Andy that that this is so big
[1:25:21.240 --> 1:25:25.320]  and that and that they were so greedy that it's even endangering the central
[1:25:25.320 --> 1:25:28.720]  banks themselves from your expert opinion and research what do you say
[1:25:28.720 --> 1:25:33.360]  absolutely in fact the Federal Reserve of New York has been using its balance
[1:25:33.360 --> 1:25:37.400]  sheet now it for the listeners because Alex I know you understand this and
[1:25:37.400 --> 1:25:41.080]  that's what it's so refreshing to be on your show because most times I talk to
[1:25:41.080 --> 1:25:44.360]  radio host you're right they think the Federal Reserve is a part of government
[1:25:44.360 --> 1:25:48.960]  you have a handle on this so it's so much easier to talk to you reality is
[1:25:48.960 --> 1:25:53.360]  that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York every time it takes a Treasury bond
[1:25:53.360 --> 1:25:57.040]  from the Treasury it adds it to its balance sheet and then it gives the
[1:25:57.040 --> 1:26:00.640]  Treasury the corresponding amount of money so over the years they built up a
[1:26:00.640 --> 1:26:05.000]  pile of about seven hundred billion dollars in Treasury notes that they
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  keep in their vault now these notes they've been exchanging for the last
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:14.240]  17 months in exchange for these bad debt instruments to kind of force liquidity
[1:26:14.240 --> 1:26:19.040]  into the system they have diluted their balance sheet at the Fed of New York so
[1:26:19.040 --> 1:26:25.040]  badly that now without this bailout if they continue to do this they'll be
[1:26:25.040 --> 1:26:29.840]  broke and the Fed of New York would go bankrupt so this is a real crisis even
[1:26:29.840 --> 1:26:34.440]  for them indeed it is this is why they're asking for this bailout now I have
[1:26:34.440 --> 1:26:38.600]  sources inside of Washington myself and when Henry Paulson came out of the
[1:26:38.600 --> 1:26:45.760]  meeting after the Congress voted down the bailout he had to be physically
[1:26:45.760 --> 1:26:51.640]  supported he was weak at his knees now this type of reaction you usually don't
[1:26:51.640 --> 1:26:54.840]  see from a person who's been through as many battles as Henry Paulson so I
[1:26:54.840 --> 1:26:59.160]  think your your argument has a little bit of weight there because they're
[1:26:59.160 --> 1:27:04.160]  worried in every circle not just at the Fed of New York now last week AP and
[1:27:04.160 --> 1:27:07.400]  Bloomberg as well as Reuters reported that there was nine hundred and forty
[1:27:07.400 --> 1:27:11.600]  billion given out at the Fed open window right that's separate from the
[1:27:11.600 --> 1:27:15.520]  700 billion or were they leveraging that what where is I mean I mean I mean
[1:27:15.520 --> 1:27:20.200]  I mean all the bonds that is separate that is separate infusions into the money
[1:27:20.200 --> 1:27:23.520]  markets that they were making based on debt instruments that people were
[1:27:23.520 --> 1:27:28.280]  turning in but in addition to that they were swapping treasury bonds for toxic
[1:27:28.280 --> 1:27:35.040]  debt through this auction term facility of theirs they did 250 125 and then 250
[1:27:35.040 --> 1:27:40.680]  at the beginning of the year so this is something that separate and distinct
[1:27:40.680 --> 1:27:44.360]  from these discount window operation was that Reuters headline accurate though
[1:27:44.360 --> 1:27:49.080]  and it said 940 billion pumped out into the banks in one week or was that a
[1:27:49.080 --> 1:27:53.760]  misprint no that was accurate I mean that's the extent of the problem and
[1:27:53.760 --> 1:27:58.280]  bear in mind again how close 980 billion is to 1 trillion right another 20
[1:27:58.280 --> 1:28:04.520]  billion and we're at 1 trillion that was the total supply of money in 1980 so in
[1:28:04.520 --> 1:28:09.600]  one week they added enough money into the system to duplicate all the money in
[1:28:09.600 --> 1:28:15.200]  existence in 1980 and that acceleration is exponential what about this cult this
[1:28:15.200 --> 1:28:20.240]  this corporate culture by the low-level people who who who've been trained to
[1:28:20.240 --> 1:28:24.880]  laugh and giggle about this I still have what I'm what I'm saying a radio show
[1:28:24.880 --> 1:28:28.440]  out of another studio one of their financial guys will come by and laugh at
[1:28:28.440 --> 1:28:32.480]  me and then he goes on air and says everything's fine we just got to bail
[1:28:32.480 --> 1:28:37.200]  him out the fellow reserves good it's federal I mean I mean they've got another
[1:28:37.200 --> 1:28:41.520]  line indeed and there is an entire culture there that does laugh at the
[1:28:41.520 --> 1:28:45.400]  public if you listen to some of the enron traders for example you'll get the
[1:28:45.400 --> 1:28:49.800]  mindset that these guys had you know they were giggling while the entire
[1:28:49.800 --> 1:28:54.360]  California coast is suffering rolling blackouts they thought it was funny
[1:28:54.360 --> 1:28:59.240]  that they had caused all of this so I mean the cynicism that permeates this
[1:28:59.240 --> 1:29:03.200]  system is the result of easy money you know anything easy is not worth
[1:29:03.200 --> 1:29:09.120]  anything and so this this loss of respect for human existence is all the at
[1:29:09.120 --> 1:29:14.680]  the root of this it is the result of all of this easy money we're gonna bring
[1:29:14.680 --> 1:29:18.320]  long segment long segment coming up for you to talk plenty and then get into
[1:29:18.320 --> 1:29:23.840]  more detail we're also be taking phone calls for our guest Andrew gals here's
[1:29:23.840 --> 1:29:29.920]  an example I'm driving into work this morning on 360 the and I the whole
[1:29:29.920 --> 1:29:33.880]  highway shut down except for one lane and it takes me 20 minutes extra to get
[1:29:33.880 --> 1:29:37.880]  to work and when I finally get up to the cops there's like 10 cop cars sitting
[1:29:37.880 --> 1:29:41.480]  around they're just talking blocking a lane bugging their eyes out with hatred
[1:29:41.480 --> 1:29:47.160]  at the public staring at them again it's just mental illness folks mental
[1:29:47.160 --> 1:29:53.720]  illness will be right back with our guest we're on the march the empires on
[1:29:53.720 --> 1:29:59.760]  the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[1:30:00.320 --> 1:30:05.920]  a day unlike any other in the long course of American history a terrorist act of
[1:30:05.920 --> 1:30:11.200]  war against this country the enemy struck America on September 11th but who is
[1:30:11.200 --> 1:30:15.760]  the enemy in London this is his M.O. we have to look to the Middle East we have to
[1:30:15.760 --> 1:30:20.120]  look to Osama bin Laden fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close
[1:30:20.120 --> 1:30:23.760]  look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United
[1:30:23.760 --> 1:30:27.960]  States some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much
[1:30:27.960 --> 1:30:33.880]  engaged in spying in and on the US I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have
[1:30:33.880 --> 1:30:38.600]  been detained in Laden's connections to the CIA the hijackers ties to the FBI

[1:33:21.280 --> 1:33:26.760]  AndyGauss.com okay I've brought up a lot of my questions made a lot of my
[1:33:26.760 --> 1:33:30.920]  points got in your take on it you know looking into your crystal ball because
[1:33:30.920 --> 1:33:33.960]  you've been pretty good at protecting things so far where do you see things
[1:33:33.960 --> 1:33:39.120]  going the next month six month year what do you think the establishment's going
[1:33:39.120 --> 1:33:46.720]  to do versus what you think is the best course of action they're gonna try to
[1:33:46.720 --> 1:33:52.040]  control hyperinflation obviously the the runaway inflation is what is one thing
[1:33:52.040 --> 1:33:57.040]  that they don't want so you'll like they'll put the 700 billion into the
[1:33:57.040 --> 1:34:01.680]  system much the same way that you give blood to a patient IV you know you
[1:34:01.680 --> 1:34:06.720]  drip it in you don't just rush the whole 700 and at the same time in doing so
[1:34:06.720 --> 1:34:11.480]  they're gonna create tsunami waves you'll you'll see a wave of inflation
[1:34:11.480 --> 1:34:15.120]  followed by a little retraction than a bigger wave of inflation followed by a
[1:34:15.120 --> 1:34:21.000]  little retraction and these ever-growing waves will continually wipe out the
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:25.920]  purchasing power of a generation not by accident either these 85 million or so
[1:34:25.920 --> 1:34:30.200]  baby boomers that are retiring and think they're gonna spend their 401ks or
[1:34:30.200 --> 1:34:34.080]  their retirement money are gonna see that the dollar that they've worked hard
[1:34:34.080 --> 1:34:39.120]  for and put away it's gonna be worth about 60 cents in two years and that's
[1:34:39.120 --> 1:34:43.440]  really what I see a slow steady controlled inflation that will
[1:34:43.440 --> 1:34:47.120]  decimate the purchasing power and that's on top of what it's already lost
[1:34:47.120 --> 1:34:51.720]  well that's right yeah I mean what I am talking 60 cents of today's dollar which
[1:34:51.720 --> 1:34:57.200]  is you know it's already 15 cents based on a 1980 dollar well here's an example I
[1:34:57.200 --> 1:35:00.640]  had governor Jesse Ventura on yesterday and I said what do you think of the
[1:35:00.640 --> 1:35:05.640]  bailout and he said well I've just lost a bunch of money myself in you know my
[1:35:05.640 --> 1:35:10.160]  investments and he said gee I don't trust him but you know it'll save things
[1:35:10.160 --> 1:35:14.920]  maybe I'd be for it and he said but overall I don't trust him so I say no so
[1:35:14.920 --> 1:35:18.240]  his instinct was right but he admitted he just hadn't had a lot of time you know
[1:35:18.240 --> 1:35:22.520]  to study it but the point is he kind of is more than the average person but a
[1:35:22.520 --> 1:35:26.960]  good window you know into an upper middle class individual and I hear these
[1:35:26.960 --> 1:35:32.640]  people saying from I don't know to I'm against it to the extreme of you're
[1:35:32.640 --> 1:35:36.680]  basically a treasonous traitor if you're not for this and this is gonna save my
[1:35:36.680 --> 1:35:42.520]  401k and I am this this this economic terrorism that we've seen that I've
[1:35:42.520 --> 1:35:46.200]  never witnessed before the president the secretary of the treasury others
[1:35:46.200 --> 1:35:50.440]  democratic leaders saying if you don't do this we will have a depression well if
[1:35:50.440 --> 1:35:54.200]  that isn't yelling fire in a theater if that didn't drive the market down Monday
[1:35:54.200 --> 1:35:59.600]  evening it's biggest one-time loss in history 1.2 trillion 1 trillion 200
[1:35:59.600 --> 1:36:04.280]  billion I don't so something comment on the economic terrorism and the illusion
[1:36:04.280 --> 1:36:07.960]  that the public's being sold that you better do this bailout or it will kill
[1:36:07.960 --> 1:36:11.920]  Main Street because even in the midterm this is going to kill Main Street with
[1:36:11.920 --> 1:36:15.600]  inflation you're right and you know those that failed to study history doomed
[1:36:15.600 --> 1:36:20.440]  to repeat it if you look at the bank wars Andrew Jackson was was basically
[1:36:20.440 --> 1:36:24.000]  making the same charges against what was then the Federal Reserve the second
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:27.640]  bank of the United States and he said you know if you vote for me I'm gonna
[1:36:27.640 --> 1:36:31.280]  kill this bank because it's bad for this country and the banks people kept
[1:36:31.280 --> 1:36:34.520]  saying oh no if you go with Jackson's plan there's going to be a depression
[1:36:34.520 --> 1:36:37.520]  we're going to contract and it's going to be awful it's going to be terrible
[1:36:37.520 --> 1:36:42.280]  but same type of economic terrorism they overplayed their hand however by
[1:36:42.280 --> 1:36:46.280]  actually delivering on their threats and then pretty soon the American people
[1:36:46.280 --> 1:36:50.640]  said wait a minute that's exactly what Jackson said they would do and in doing
[1:36:50.640 --> 1:36:55.440]  so they lost the battle so if they if they overplayed their hand in this
[1:36:55.440 --> 1:36:59.920]  instance I honestly think of the American people would have stood up and
[1:36:59.920 --> 1:37:02.440]  pressured the Senate a lot more than they did
[1:37:02.440 --> 1:37:06.920]  unfortunately they have a snowballed they have us believing that if we don't
[1:37:06.920 --> 1:37:12.160]  do this we're gonna all suffer and so as a result great many Americans are
[1:37:12.160 --> 1:37:16.200]  calling Washington and urging them to do something they don't know what to do
[1:37:16.200 --> 1:37:20.080]  but they urge them to do something the senators and congressmen are
[1:37:20.080 --> 1:37:24.400]  interpreting this as hey they want us to vote for the bailout but no one has
[1:37:24.400 --> 1:37:28.560]  presented an alternative plan if we just look at this from simple mathematics
[1:37:28.560 --> 1:37:32.600]  we'll see if there's a seven hundred billion dollar bond issued by the
[1:37:32.600 --> 1:37:36.880]  Treasury then that means there's about thirty five billion dollars in annual
[1:37:36.880 --> 1:37:42.040]  interest payments due on that bond if we take over the Federal Reserve Bank of
[1:37:42.040 --> 1:37:46.320]  New York we can eliminate that thirty five billion dollars in annual interest
[1:37:46.320 --> 1:37:50.920]  payments so just from a pure economic sense it makes perfect sense for us to
[1:37:50.920 --> 1:37:55.320]  take over the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as our number one supplier of
[1:37:55.320 --> 1:37:59.280]  debt plus never plus it's the private Federal Reserve that engineered this
[1:37:59.280 --> 1:38:04.120]  current architecture so why after we catch the weasel sucking the blood of
[1:38:04.120 --> 1:38:08.040]  14 chickens are we now giving him the job of security guard
[1:38:08.040 --> 1:38:13.120]  yeah watch the chickens precisely as I put it and every ball field in America
[1:38:13.120 --> 1:38:17.360]  three strikes and you're out when the Federal Reserve did this from 13 to 29
[1:38:17.360 --> 1:38:21.320]  those guys should have gone to jail but they didn't when they crashed the
[1:38:21.320 --> 1:38:25.760]  housing market to the SNL crisis in the 80s that was their second strike they
[1:38:25.760 --> 1:38:30.040]  should have gone to jail and they didn't now this is their third strike and I say
[1:38:30.040 --> 1:38:34.240]  we stopped talking about bailouts and start talking about bail amounts you
[1:38:34.240 --> 1:38:37.360]  know how much are they gonna have to pay to get out of jail because that's the
[1:38:37.360 --> 1:38:40.680]  only thing that I think is relevant now and by the way let's specifically talk
[1:38:40.680 --> 1:38:44.040]  about what they've done that's criminal they didn't just go in and change the
[1:38:44.040 --> 1:38:49.640]  laws they've clearly throughout the entire banking system engaged you know
[1:38:49.640 --> 1:38:56.660]  in in falsely certifying junk as triple A in insider trading and conflicts of
[1:38:56.660 --> 1:38:59.920]  interest I mean it just never ends right the credit default swaps are a
[1:38:59.920 --> 1:39:03.440]  perfect example here you have a hedge fund that comes out and says okay we're
[1:39:03.440 --> 1:39:07.240]  gonna issue a bond and because we're a new hedge fund we don't have any capital
[1:39:07.240 --> 1:39:11.920]  the bond is rated triple B now no one's gonna be able to buy that bond no one's
[1:39:11.920 --> 1:39:15.760]  gonna be able to buy it because it's low rated no pension fund will buy it no
[1:39:15.760 --> 1:39:19.560]  bank will buy it but suddenly the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's owners
[1:39:19.560 --> 1:39:24.520]  decide they're gonna convince an insurance company to co-sign that bond a
[1:39:24.520 --> 1:39:28.600]  credit default swap saying if they default will step in and make good
[1:39:28.600 --> 1:39:33.600]  suddenly that bond is triple A suddenly you just bypass the regulations that
[1:39:33.600 --> 1:39:37.880]  were put into place to prevent this if that's not a violation of the letter of
[1:39:37.880 --> 1:39:41.840]  the law it certainly is a violation of the spirit and they knew full well that
[1:39:41.840 --> 1:39:45.400]  that hedge fund was at more risk than they could handle and they allowed the
[1:39:45.400 --> 1:39:49.240]  deal to go through imagine going to your local banker and trying to borrow money
[1:39:49.240 --> 1:39:52.640]  and he looks at your balance sheet and says oh no you can't do this because
[1:39:52.640 --> 1:39:56.000]  you're gonna have more debt than you have the ability to pay that's what
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:40:00.200]  they're supposed to do not once did the Federal Reserve Bank of New York stop
[1:40:00.200 --> 1:40:06.960]  Goldman Sachs Lehman Brothers Bear Stearns UBS JP Morgan City Group
[1:40:06.960 --> 1:40:11.640]  Deutsche Bank Hong Kong Shanghai these are all their owners they didn't stop
[1:40:11.640 --> 1:40:16.620]  them from issuing these debt instruments had they done so there wouldn't be 45
[1:40:16.620 --> 1:40:20.360]  trillion dollars in claims against 14 trillion in money so it was their
[1:40:20.360 --> 1:40:26.160]  dramatic lack of oversight that created this crisis and on that basis alone they
[1:40:26.160 --> 1:40:31.720]  should be put out of business but we have worldwide the just trillions upon
[1:40:31.720 --> 1:40:35.240]  trillions unknown they're all being secretive because of all the crimes
[1:40:35.240 --> 1:40:39.320]  they've committed I don't think any amount of quote bailouts is going to
[1:40:39.320 --> 1:40:44.680]  going to quote save the structure it's it's only going to prolong it and
[1:40:44.680 --> 1:40:49.160]  deepen it so so again what do you see happening in six months a year hyper
[1:40:49.160 --> 1:40:53.520]  inflation BIS report I don't know if you caught that that showed the total
[1:40:53.520 --> 1:40:57.240]  derivatives market outstanding at the second quarter of this year was five
[1:40:57.240 --> 1:41:04.440]  hundred and ninety six trillion dollars so nevermind 45 against 14 596
[1:41:04.440 --> 1:41:08.960]  trillion dollars if they have to put that much or even a tenth of that in the
[1:41:08.960 --> 1:41:13.080]  circulation if they have to go to 50 trillion from 14 that's going to mean
[1:41:13.080 --> 1:41:16.960]  anything that cost you a dollar today it's going to cost you three dollars a
[1:41:16.960 --> 1:41:20.320]  couple years from now well there's a secret of no one knows but like you said
[1:41:20.320 --> 1:41:23.800]  500 something trillion a lot of economists we have on say it's more like
[1:41:23.800 --> 1:41:30.080]  a thousand trillion how many times is that more than all the true assets and
[1:41:30.080 --> 1:41:35.000]  wealth in the world well you couldn't do that that calculation it is at least
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:40.200]  quadruple all of the known financial assets so it's four times all of the
[1:41:40.200 --> 1:41:44.000]  paper assets but you start talking physical assets you know how much is a
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:48.520]  person's real estate or house worth I doubt that it could ever be repaid but
[1:41:48.520 --> 1:41:55.120]  again this is total fraud this isn't real but they've got the regular army
[1:41:55.120 --> 1:41:58.160]  brigades according to army times come into the u.s. they say it's for civil
[1:41:58.160 --> 1:42:02.320]  emergency bush put the John Warner defense authorization act in place which
[1:42:02.320 --> 1:42:06.000]  says it's for martial law and suppression of the people in the bill that
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:11.560]  passed years ago two years ago I mean it's all happening they clearly are
[1:42:11.560 --> 1:42:15.840]  behaving as if they know that they're only trying to stall long enough to get
[1:42:15.840 --> 1:42:20.760]  their grid in place and then I guess they come out on top in the road warriors
[1:42:20.760 --> 1:42:26.440]  scenario and they're talking about then failing forward into a new world banking
[1:42:26.440 --> 1:42:31.360]  system where those that engineered this poses the saviors and set up this world
[1:42:31.360 --> 1:42:38.440]  regulatory banking system in the sort of new bubble out of carbon credits or
[1:42:38.440 --> 1:42:43.760]  something can you comment on that a carbon tax yeah it's a perfect system if
[1:42:43.760 --> 1:42:48.920]  if you consider the end result is that they want to have the single currency in
[1:42:48.920 --> 1:42:53.560]  the world be the dollar and if you look at world trade now I mean that you know
[1:42:53.560 --> 1:42:56.560]  I've gotten into these debates with colleagues who feel a lot like you and I
[1:42:56.560 --> 1:43:02.000]  do which is they already control this game they're already firmly in control
[1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:05.760]  after world war two we established all the central banks of Europe the bank of
[1:43:05.760 --> 1:43:10.480]  Japan is an outpost of the United States Treasury the family of the elite don't
[1:43:10.480 --> 1:43:14.360]  have to total control to the middle class is gone until we're all drooling on
[1:43:14.360 --> 1:43:20.360]  Prozac and they and the elite says that they want us dumb down and slaves well
[1:43:20.360 --> 1:43:23.600]  you know the biggest wealth owners in this country is that baby boom
[1:43:23.600 --> 1:43:28.120]  generation that started working right after world war two and raised their
[1:43:28.120 --> 1:43:31.880]  families worked hard for the last 30 years and managed to combine savings of
[1:43:31.880 --> 1:43:37.320]  800,000 to a million two on their thirty to forty thousand a year salary they
[1:43:37.320 --> 1:43:41.920]  scrimped and saved and put away this mountain of money and now these guys
[1:43:41.920 --> 1:43:46.520]  these 85 billion baby boomers that are retiring will have their entire wealth
[1:43:46.520 --> 1:43:51.560]  talk about the middle class reduced in value by two-thirds with the stroke of
[1:43:51.560 --> 1:43:56.360]  a virtual pen so in a span of 24 months they're going to be able to wipe out a
[1:43:56.360 --> 1:44:01.560]  lifetime of savings by the most prolific generation that we've seen in 150
[1:44:01.560 --> 1:44:06.200]  years the country the private banks own and control the corporate propaganda
[1:44:06.200 --> 1:44:10.080]  channels it's not even media and they're on their saying depression if you don't
[1:44:10.080 --> 1:44:14.080]  do this right over if you don't do this imagine if they told the public the
[1:44:14.080 --> 1:44:17.800]  truth we're taking two-thirds of your savings we're devaluing your investments
[1:44:17.800 --> 1:44:22.480]  and your dollar we're destroying your retirement your future I mean people think
[1:44:22.480 --> 1:44:25.960]  the public's already mad they're going to be hopping mad and so here's a 64
[1:44:25.960 --> 1:44:30.360]  million dollar question used to be the 64 thousand but now with inflation
[1:44:30.360 --> 1:44:35.500]  six million what is going to happen a year or two down the road when the
[1:44:35.500 --> 1:44:39.760]  uppies find out that they were screwed and this was a setup well we're going
[1:44:39.760 --> 1:44:43.400]  to be yelling at the greedy oil companies and the greedy car dealers and
[1:44:43.400 --> 1:44:47.560]  boy those nasty people at the grocery store raising their prices the last
[1:44:47.560 --> 1:44:51.400]  person we'll point a finger at is the Federal Reserve Bank in New York and I
[1:44:51.400 --> 1:44:55.640]  don't think our take back the Fed movement will be successful I believe
[1:44:55.640 --> 1:44:59.800]  they sneer at us like we said in the last segment they they look down upon us
[1:44:59.800 --> 1:45:04.000]  and they are so blatant now they don't even put on a good car anymore Alex they
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:08.200]  used to hide this stuff now it's just so out in the open I'm reminded of what
[1:45:08.200 --> 1:45:12.720]  Carol Quigley said and my colleague Matt who incidentally wears an info wars
[1:45:12.720 --> 1:45:17.000]  bumper sticker on his car awesome like a badge of honor drives it around New York
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:21.880]  City flashes it in the cops faces he just he's one of your stalwart soldiers
[1:45:21.880 --> 1:45:27.880]  he says Carol Quigley's book said when the velvet glove is removed from the
[1:45:27.880 --> 1:45:33.000]  iron fist maybe then the people will understand but until they come right out
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:37.240]  and in your face tell you they don't care what you think the majority Americans
[1:45:37.240 --> 1:45:40.920]  are going to act like the sheep that they are lead themselves to be sheared and
[1:45:40.920 --> 1:45:46.760]  gladly grow some more fur for the next cutting unbelievable and they're doing
[1:45:46.760 --> 1:45:51.120]  it they are doing it right now but but I am heartened that polls are showing 90
[1:45:51.120 --> 1:45:55.480]  plus percent even with the financial terrorism and fear-mongering of do this
[1:45:55.480 --> 1:46:00.920]  or else that we we call the public sheeple they figured out that pretty
[1:46:00.920 --> 1:46:06.520]  much anything the media says is a lie or spin and so it is gonna I mean I agree
[1:46:06.520 --> 1:46:09.960]  the media is gonna blame the shopkeepers and the car dealers if any of that even
[1:46:09.960 --> 1:46:15.200]  exist but but I think it's gonna break down even even faster than that
[1:46:15.200 --> 1:46:19.160]  but you could be right and I'll tell you with you and your bullhorn and then
[1:46:19.160 --> 1:46:22.600]  your soldiers like Matt out there spreading the word more and more people
[1:46:22.600 --> 1:46:26.720]  are catching on I'm just afraid it's too little too late because the bulk of
[1:46:26.720 --> 1:46:30.760]  Americans are all shareholders in the Federal Reserve system you're the
[1:46:30.760 --> 1:46:35.560]  percentage of Americans that actually own tangible money gold and silver coins
[1:46:35.560 --> 1:46:40.640]  as you're talking one or two percent the other 98 percent while they may even be
[1:46:40.640 --> 1:46:44.800]  against the entire system they still keep 100 percent of their wealth tied up
[1:46:44.800 --> 1:46:48.640]  in the Federal Reserve so they're nothing but shareholders in the system I
[1:46:48.640 --> 1:46:52.400]  suggest if people really want to make a difference they need to start force
[1:46:52.400 --> 1:46:56.620]  feeding their Federal Reserve notes back into the system and taking out what the
[1:46:56.620 --> 1:47:01.040]  Constitution defines as money and that's gold and silver coin once they
[1:47:01.040 --> 1:47:04.280]  start doing that Alex there's no way to stop it all right let me bring that up
[1:47:04.280 --> 1:47:07.080]  now because that was one of my next questions and I want to tell folks about
[1:47:07.080 --> 1:47:10.720]  all the great information you have in your site and books and materials because
[1:47:10.720 --> 1:47:14.360]  I want people to check it out it's very impressive and totally on target really
[1:47:14.360 --> 1:47:20.360]  cuts through all the minutiae and gets right down to the facts already you can't
[1:47:20.360 --> 1:47:27.480]  get buffaloes the U.S. Mint is saying it can't get gold to make coins
[1:47:27.480 --> 1:47:33.880]  Kitco is sold out of most of their coins you can't find gold really anywhere at
[1:47:33.880 --> 1:47:40.320]  spot anymore silver is is running out but artificially the central banks admit
[1:47:40.320 --> 1:47:45.560]  that they are suppressing the price of metals but I don't even see them being
[1:47:45.560 --> 1:47:48.480]  able to suppress this more than just a few months I mean it's already gone up
[1:47:48.480 --> 1:47:55.040]  somewhat so I wanted to ask you I mean about that because it's I mean we're
[1:47:55.040 --> 1:47:57.880]  already running out of gold and silver right now with just a fraction of the
[1:47:57.880 --> 1:48:03.160]  public getting wise the moment even just a few more percentage points of the know
[1:48:03.160 --> 1:48:06.560]  it all yuppies figure out they've been conned and try to get out of their banks
[1:48:06.560 --> 1:48:10.640]  and stocks there is gonna be no gold or silver anywhere can you talk about that
[1:48:10.640 --> 1:48:15.280]  indeed a front page of the financial times that work yesterday well talked
[1:48:15.280 --> 1:48:19.000]  about that very issue and what we're seeing is a disconnect between the
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:24.040]  physical market and the paper or electronic market and while you can buy
[1:48:24.040 --> 1:48:28.880]  all of the physical gold that you want and pay a premium above what it would
[1:48:28.880 --> 1:48:34.520]  cost you if you were buying electronic or paper that spread is just widening
[1:48:34.520 --> 1:48:38.400]  every day now there's a handful of smart guys out there and in fact one of them
[1:48:38.400 --> 1:48:43.240]  sponsors your show that puts stuff away for their clients ahead of time and
[1:48:43.240 --> 1:48:47.760]  that's what you need you need dealers who lean against the wind you when
[1:48:47.760 --> 1:48:50.760]  everyone's selling they're buying and then when it's time to buy they're ready
[1:48:50.760 --> 1:48:54.120]  with inventory to sell so you might have to look a little bit but there are
[1:48:54.120 --> 1:48:57.840]  sharp dealers out there who still have inventory I know we loaded in a position
[1:48:57.840 --> 1:49:02.400]  and I'm pretty sure Midas did as well so you can get stuff if you go to the
[1:49:02.400 --> 1:49:07.400]  right source absolutely Midas resources in fact has gold at basically below what
[1:49:07.400 --> 1:49:12.680]  it's even selling for now and they've got it it's just that local dealers in
[1:49:12.680 --> 1:49:17.680]  Austin are sold out or very low I go to other places I see reports in
[1:49:17.680 --> 1:49:23.320]  newspapers about gold and silver sold out in shops all over so definitely the
[1:49:23.320 --> 1:49:26.200]  smaller dealers are really having a lot of trouble and only the bigger dealers
[1:49:26.200 --> 1:49:30.400]  and people that have a lot of sources are able to get it how high do you see
[1:49:30.400 --> 1:49:34.400]  gold going in the next six months well our model shows gold peaking out at
[1:49:34.400 --> 1:49:39.400]  1600 in the next six months before we are in a sell mode so we're still buying
[1:49:39.400 --> 1:49:43.920]  with both hands and I wouldn't be a seller until gold hits 1600 on the
[1:49:43.920 --> 1:49:49.480]  silver side triple I think silver has to hit 34 dollars an ounce before I'll be
[1:49:49.480 --> 1:49:55.160]  a seller so until then I'm buying well isn't gold performing in the last seven
[1:49:55.160 --> 1:50:00.040]  years at like 30% and the stock market is losing money yeah you're right about
[1:50:00.040 --> 1:50:03.680]  that if you look at just a seven-year window you'll find gold probably out
[1:50:03.680 --> 1:50:07.440]  produced every other investment except the most speculative and risky and the
[1:50:07.440 --> 1:50:12.240]  best part of it is is that once it's in your control it's almost impossible for
[1:50:12.240 --> 1:50:16.920]  anyone to do anything to dilute the value of your money that is your money
[1:50:16.920 --> 1:50:20.080]  now all you have to do is protect it but you know if there's a catch to
[1:50:20.080 --> 1:50:24.080]  everything this the catch to this is when you take physical possession of gold
[1:50:24.080 --> 1:50:29.040]  you have to protect it you have to guard it like it's cash and most Americans
[1:50:29.040 --> 1:50:31.760]  aren't willing to accept that responsibility so I think it's good
[1:50:31.760 --> 1:50:35.480]  you still have a window if you haven't accumulated any gold or silver yet you
[1:50:35.480 --> 1:50:39.240]  have a little window here before the rest of the consuming public figures out
[1:50:39.240 --> 1:50:44.680]  what's going on but boy when they do look out ladies and gentlemen Andy Goss is

[1:54:10.120 --> 1:54:14.560]  Andy Goss really appreciate him joining us let's go ahead and talk to Tim and
[1:54:14.560 --> 1:54:34.280]  Georgia you're on the air with our guest when you said about us when the chair said explain to me like I'm a six-year-old when I'm trying to get people to wake up to the Federal Reserve I'll use the analogy I'll say hey I'm the bank of me and you two guys have banked and I'm the Federal Reserve and I loan you $100
[1:54:34.280 --> 1:54:40.880]  interest on you $100 at interest they can percent and now you guys owe me $210 where does
[1:54:40.880 --> 1:54:45.760]  the $10 come from and nobody can answer the question and the I think the answer is
[1:54:45.760 --> 1:54:49.400]  you have to borrow it in the circulation at more interest is that correct that is
[1:54:49.400 --> 1:54:52.440]  correct yeah they never create the interest when they create the money and
[1:54:52.440 --> 1:54:56.480]  so that creates a constant demand for money that's greater than the supply
[1:54:56.480 --> 1:55:00.080]  that's what gives these worthless piece of paper value in the first place and
[1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:05.960]  that's what gives them so much power right this is a parlor trick folks this
[1:55:05.960 --> 1:55:11.480]  is a parlor trick so without interest they lose they don't have their magic
[1:55:11.480 --> 1:55:15.680]  bullet then that's right if you took away the interest and just started issuing
[1:55:15.680 --> 1:55:19.600]  money without interest pretty soon the worklessness of it would be quickly
[1:55:19.600 --> 1:55:24.520]  revealed listen to me more supply than demand exactly look the Wizard of Oz was
[1:55:24.520 --> 1:55:30.280]  a popular anti-banker play that went all over the country for decades before it
[1:55:30.280 --> 1:55:33.800]  was made into a movie that's all about the little man behind the curtain the
[1:55:33.800 --> 1:55:39.200]  yellow brick road the emerald city it's all about the fraud mm-hmm no question
[1:55:39.200 --> 1:55:43.000]  about it isn't it that little analogy enables me to challenge people on their
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:46.960]  base paradigm there and then these always nobody can tell you where it comes
[1:55:46.960 --> 1:55:52.480]  from but then we have the the financial minions right down the locals who all
[1:55:52.480 --> 1:55:56.400]  think they're part of the system and see it's an inside joke the guys on radio and
[1:55:56.400 --> 1:56:00.600]  TV they're laughing at you I was watching CNBC yesterday and it's they're
[1:56:00.600 --> 1:56:04.520]  there like con artists you know giggling and smirking and winking at each other
[1:56:04.520 --> 1:56:08.760]  and and smiling at you through the teleprompter I mean it's about suckering
[1:56:08.760 --> 1:56:13.240]  you it's such a big disgusting joke your comments on that Andy yeah well here's
[1:56:13.240 --> 1:56:17.080]  where I get traction on the Federal Reserve I point to their 47 lear jets
[1:56:17.080 --> 1:56:21.160]  and their 300 million dollar art collection with a full-time curator to
[1:56:21.160 --> 1:56:25.560]  take care of it and the fact that all of this is done without appropriating money
[1:56:25.560 --> 1:56:30.160]  from the Treasury they simply create the money to buy this stuff and for that
[1:56:30.160 --> 1:56:34.440]  reason alone they should be forced to come to Congress for appropriations
[1:56:34.440 --> 1:56:37.840]  every time they want to spend money instead of being able to just spend it
[1:56:37.840 --> 1:56:43.520]  out there I can even get the most hardened NBA company guy to agree with me
[1:56:43.520 --> 1:56:47.880]  on that point once you got him there it's easy step from there to nationalize
[1:56:47.880 --> 1:56:51.760]  your fed that's right people are in a self-imposed mental prison let's talk
[1:56:51.760 --> 1:56:55.800]  to Charles in California you're on the air with our guests go ahead hey guys

[2:00:37.840 --> 2:00:43.000]  because they don't have the gold that's because in the real market it costs a
[2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:47.360]  lot more than what's going on in paper and every day it's widening now ladies

[2:01:03.920 --> 2:01:08.000]  the only reason you're hearing this deal is because I wanted to get a few
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:12.280]  buffalos a month ago and I told Ted I wanted some only by a few coins here in
[2:01:12.280 --> 2:01:17.560]  there a month sometimes I can't even do that trying to convert a few fellow
[2:01:17.560 --> 2:01:21.720]  reserve notes into this is backup and he had trouble getting it before they
[2:01:21.720 --> 2:01:28.920]  suspended sale but Ted got a hold of some limited supply a limited supply and
[2:01:28.920 --> 2:01:33.800]  he's got them at a very low price these things are selling at 20 30 40% premiums
[2:01:33.800 --> 2:01:39.120]  right now they're a gorgeous coin and it's one of the latest coins that the

[2:01:48.400 --> 2:01:52.840]  Franks and the British sovereigns are selling at premiums but Ted buys when
[2:01:52.840 --> 2:01:57.160]  the market's going down so that he can offer it to you at a discount but
[2:01:57.160 --> 2:02:01.800]  understand this is a limited time with these buffalos first come a first serve
[2:02:01.800 --> 2:02:05.680]  Ted tell them about them yeah it is actually very limited and I do have them
[2:02:05.680 --> 2:02:09.920]  available right now at 920 and when you ask me to go out there and find them I
[2:02:09.920 --> 2:02:13.720]  mean there are people that wanted over a thousand dollars for these things a very
[2:02:13.720 --> 2:02:19.800]  limited supply you can get them or mine to our mind yeah 920 dollars and you
[2:02:19.800 --> 2:02:26.000]  know if you want them call us at 800-686-2237 the Frank coin is an

[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:34.520]  United States that market is pretty well dried up my supplies are coming in from
[2:02:34.520 --> 2:02:40.320]  Europe and it's don't be stupid use opportunities when gold is sitting there
[2:02:40.320 --> 2:02:44.880]  not going up or down use it you are nuts if you don't Ted tell folks about some
[2:02:44.880 --> 2:02:48.200]  of the other offers not just the buffalo yeah sure the buffaloes are great by but

[2:03:05.480 --> 2:03:08.360]  gone they're gone and you know I'll be lucky to get some more of them if I
[2:03:08.360 --> 2:03:13.360]  can but it's very limited but if the smaller coins are better for trade anyways
[2:03:13.360 --> 2:03:16.960]  and and you can get a lot more gold there's Chad's interesting here you

[2:04:48.040 --> 2:04:50.680]  dollar and the silver dollar is worth more than the book we charge now I was
[2:04:50.680 --> 2:04:58.080]  not say folks that's insane 800 686 2237 Ted I want to come back for one minute
[2:04:58.080 --> 2:05:05.400]  William and George Butler had the opportunity to speak to my 90 year old
[2:05:05.400 --> 2:05:08.360]  grandmother at some length here recently and she was talking about the Great
[2:05:08.360 --> 2:05:11.560]  Depression and we were talking about the gas prices the food prices this
[2:05:11.560 --> 2:05:15.200]  economic uncertainty we're in these you know really kind of perilous times no
[2:05:15.200 --> 2:05:18.280]  one knows where we're headed or where we might end up and she was reminded of the
[2:05:18.280 --> 2:05:21.800]  Great Depression and how in those days folks who lived in the country did okay
[2:05:21.800 --> 2:05:24.520]  because they had chicken and eggs and they could grow gardens and can their
[2:05:24.520 --> 2:05:27.760]  food but how difficult it was for people who lived in urban areas or in the
[2:05:27.760 --> 2:05:30.840]  cities because they didn't have the landscape for gardening or the know how
[2:05:30.840 --> 2:05:33.640]  they didn't have the chickens in the livestock so it's a lot different for
[2:05:33.640 --> 2:05:36.920]  them well we know one thing's certain right now we're headed into much higher
[2:05:36.920 --> 2:05:40.600]  prices on food and there is a global food shortage now what can you do to

[2:08:22.640 --> 2:08:30.240]  that is also exciting I wanted to go back to Ted Anderson just briefly Ted I
[2:08:30.240 --> 2:08:34.480]  wanted to get your comment on the financial terrorism with the Federal
[2:08:34.480 --> 2:08:39.400]  Reserve Ted Anderson of course the minus resources watching the the metals
[2:08:39.400 --> 2:08:44.520]  commodity markets closely there on the inside of it I mean this was so clear
[2:08:44.520 --> 2:08:47.640]  terrorizing the public the Congress thing if you don't pass this will be a
[2:08:47.640 --> 2:08:52.320]  depression they say no Monday four days ago it plunges one trillion two hundred
[2:08:52.320 --> 2:08:56.560]  million dollars in one day terrorizing the public the president's plunge
[2:08:56.560 --> 2:09:00.240]  protection team didn't profit up that day and then the public is still is an
[2:09:00.240 --> 2:09:03.800]  acquiescing but the Senate passes it the house set to pass it today or tomorrow
[2:09:03.800 --> 2:09:08.280]  Ted Anderson your take on that oh yeah they and you know probably will pass
[2:09:08.280 --> 2:09:11.680]  tomorrow when it does just hold on your hat because there's gonna be so much new
[2:09:11.680 --> 2:09:15.000]  currency coming into the system through that Federal Reserve system all that
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:19.560]  money is being printed from thin air and to bail out the you know the who they
[2:09:19.560 --> 2:09:23.440]  bailing out they're bailing out the member banks that have the risk here
[2:09:23.440 --> 2:09:27.640]  they're they're they're basically saying one more one more gash into the
[2:09:27.640 --> 2:09:31.560]  taxpayer to solve yeah they know it's going down and they're gonna set up a
[2:09:31.560 --> 2:09:35.880]  world banking system with world laws out of that again they pose the crisis
[2:09:35.880 --> 2:09:40.680]  then they pose as the saviors and offer the false solution Alex a world
[2:09:40.680 --> 2:09:46.720]  banking system will be the ultimate way to collect labor from the entire world
[2:09:46.720 --> 2:09:50.720]  and that they've been doing that to us here in the United States for the you
[2:09:50.720 --> 2:09:55.280]  know since nineteen thirteen and it's just crazy that we let this come along
[2:09:55.280 --> 2:09:59.800]  in the first place with the new order is it is a global corporate takeover of the
[2:09:59.800 --> 2:10:07.120]  world's energy supplies finance the the food systems everything it's it's the
[2:10:07.120 --> 2:10:11.080]  it's the biggest form of surfdom there is out there we will become their slaves
[2:10:11.080 --> 2:10:14.840]  will be working for them and they will produce nothing and will be turning over
[2:10:14.840 --> 2:10:18.480]  our production well here's the bad news there's not enough gold and silver for
[2:10:18.480 --> 2:10:23.960]  the general public of the west to protect themselves but the the good news is
[2:10:23.960 --> 2:10:27.560]  because we can't help that the good news is at least our listeners and people
[2:10:27.560 --> 2:10:31.800]  that are informed know that they still have time to get into gold and silver
[2:10:31.800 --> 2:10:35.640]  and other metals before it's too late because once the people find out about
[2:10:35.640 --> 2:10:40.320]  hyperinflation that's already with us but gonna compound now there won't be
[2:10:40.320 --> 2:10:44.760]  enough gold and silver and the price will be so high most people aren't gonna be
[2:10:44.760 --> 2:10:49.240]  able to afford it because we're going to have a depression and a deflation in
[2:10:49.240 --> 2:10:53.200]  jobs and the amount of money people can get at the same time while prices are
[2:10:53.200 --> 2:10:58.280]  going up stagflation so stag hyperinflation some I mean stagflation
[2:10:58.280 --> 2:11:01.280]  was invented by the bankers in the seventies I guess we have to call this
[2:11:01.280 --> 2:11:05.760]  stag hyperinflation I can't think of a worse scenario Ted yeah you got job
[2:11:05.760 --> 2:11:09.200] lessness right now and you also have printing of money though two of them
[2:11:09.200 --> 2:11:12.920]  goes together you have a price inflation and you have and you know
[2:11:12.920 --> 2:11:16.440]  unemployment's gonna go up at the same time that's crazy I mean the people are
[2:11:16.440 --> 2:11:19.480]  just straddled the people are getting hurt the worst of the people that have
[2:11:19.480 --> 2:11:22.840]  been saving all their lives entering into the retirement age and they're not
[2:11:22.840 --> 2:11:26.520]  gonna have any value left in their currency and they and what are they
[2:11:26.520 --> 2:11:31.080]  gonna go to Social Security there's not enough money there it's they don't the
[2:11:31.080 --> 2:11:34.200]  figures are not gonna but not just that they won't even pay you for the cost of
[2:11:34.200 --> 2:11:38.320]  living increase from inflation no they won't because they'll go off the CPI and
[2:11:38.320 --> 2:11:42.320]  the CPI is a doped up figure that's not even real everybody know all right all
[2:11:42.320 --> 2:11:46.600]  right well Ted Anderson again I bet in five minutes you've already sold out of
[2:11:46.600 --> 2:11:51.360]  those those buffaloes I mean I would call right away if you're interested in
[2:11:51.360 --> 2:11:54.640]  those buffaloes I would call right now because there is definitely not a lot
[2:11:54.640 --> 2:11:58.400]  of that to go around also right now you're talking about that creature from
[2:11:58.400 --> 2:12:02.840]  Jekyll Island that book is 1995 you get the silver dollar for free right now
[2:12:02.840 --> 2:12:06.240]  you're paying $20 for silver dollars so it's a great buy I mean if you want
[2:12:06.240 --> 2:12:12.160]  800 686 2237 and to get that tell them Alex Jones and Ted Anderson since you
[2:12:12.160 --> 2:12:18.920]  1-800-686-2237 folks it's a win-win-win-win-win it and the margins here
[2:12:18.920 --> 2:12:22.680]  are so small but it supports the network makes this show possible let's Ted
[2:12:22.680 --> 2:12:27.040]  hire more board ops get he just got an even better star guide satellite for
[2:12:27.040 --> 2:12:29.760]  stations that didn't get the notice we're switching over to that in a month we
[2:12:29.760 --> 2:12:34.720]  have both star guide feeds going right now it allows you to get gold and silver
[2:12:34.720 --> 2:12:39.800]  at incredibly good prices win-win-win-win-win because Ted buys when the
[2:12:39.800 --> 2:12:43.280]  market's going down so when the market's going up you can pass on those
[2:12:43.280 --> 2:12:45.920]  discounts to you and you can get the creature from Jekyll Island and I know
[2:12:45.920 --> 2:12:50.640]  sells for like 24 bucks in bookstores Ted's selling it for 1995 and you get
[2:12:50.640 --> 2:12:55.400]  a free silver dollar you can't get silver dollars for below $20 so that is
[2:12:55.400 --> 2:13:02.040]  basically a free silver dollar but you cannot beat that 1995 for this preacher
[2:13:02.040 --> 2:13:05.240]  from Jekyll Island the history of the banking system you may know all about it
[2:13:05.240 --> 2:13:08.320]  but your neighbors your friends your family don't so you get the book to give
[2:13:08.320 --> 2:13:11.480]  to somebody read it yourself and then give it away and you get the silver
[2:13:11.480 --> 2:13:15.600]  dollar you get a free silver dollar I don't know how you're offering that Ted
[2:13:15.600 --> 2:13:22.960]  800 may not after this show with me plug in this 800 686 2237 Ted thanks for
[2:13:22.960 --> 2:13:27.200]  coming on yeah thanks for having me up out you bet okay shifting gears and I'm
[2:13:27.200 --> 2:13:30.800]  gonna keep a little bit in with ship if you've got some questions to George
[2:13:30.800 --> 2:13:34.680]  Butler George Butler has a Saturday evening show here on Genesis and I've
[2:13:34.680 --> 2:13:39.560]  done George for years George Butler so much is happening so much is going on
[2:13:39.560 --> 2:13:43.240]  but you're also a long time real estate agent I know you're involved in
[2:13:43.240 --> 2:13:47.080]  brokerage as well because you you brokered a deal on another office we
[2:13:47.080 --> 2:13:52.720]  leased so so I want to talk about you know the overarching banking
[2:13:52.720 --> 2:13:56.960]  infrastructure but then the real economy on Main Street Austin the
[2:13:56.960 --> 2:14:01.320]  supposedly you know wealthiest per capita city in the country the best city
[2:14:01.320 --> 2:14:06.200]  live in rated the last four years consecutively still the best but we
[2:14:06.200 --> 2:14:09.800]  see restaurants I've gone to for years are closing my wife went to the mall
[2:14:09.800 --> 2:14:13.800]  yesterday to get some prescription glasses no one was at the mall it's
[2:14:13.800 --> 2:14:17.600]  usually jam packed at that time we're seeing I mean in this in this city
[2:14:17.600 --> 2:14:22.000]  supposedly the best I know some other real estate agents and they say the
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:25.720]  markets dropped about 20% the media isn't really covering that but they said in
[2:14:25.720 --> 2:14:28.680]  the jumbo loan and the million dollar houses which are four bedrooms in this
[2:14:28.680 --> 2:14:33.240]  town the price has gone up people are refusing to sell and they're refusing
[2:14:33.240 --> 2:14:36.760]  to lower their price but nothing selling for months so I want to talk about
[2:14:36.760 --> 2:14:40.120]  Main Street as well from your perspective George Butler good to have
[2:14:40.120 --> 2:14:45.680]  you know thank you Alex for being you're inviting me here today yeah Main
[2:14:45.680 --> 2:14:50.440]  Street is being affected in a way that that was predicted by many I think you
[2:14:50.440 --> 2:14:54.040]  predicted some of this along with Ted and others over the years I didn't
[2:14:54.040 --> 2:14:57.160]  predict it the bankers said they were gonna do it yes yeah I just said oh the
[2:14:57.160 --> 2:15:01.200]  enemies declared war you started announcing it early on though that we
[2:15:01.200 --> 2:15:05.400]  would be put into some kind of a depression or some kind of a severe
[2:15:05.400 --> 2:15:09.960]  recession and so you were at the forefront with with other people but
[2:15:09.960 --> 2:15:13.520]  we're seeing now that credit lines are being audited by some of the largest
[2:15:13.520 --> 2:15:17.680]  banks the Chase themselves are auditing out in El Paso I have some
[2:15:17.680 --> 2:15:22.000]  contacts out there and they got back and they said well the loan would be two or
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:25.920]  three weeks later than than possibly they could make right now so they are
[2:15:25.920 --> 2:15:29.880]  stalling on some of our loans right now what I mean we see the credit markets
[2:15:29.880 --> 2:15:35.040]  shutting down to a great extent yes the mortgage loans in Austin Texas Austin
[2:15:35.040 --> 2:15:39.000]  has been an exception to the rule up until now and I've noticed in the last
[2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:43.520]  three to four weeks I've been getting all three to five times as many emails
[2:15:43.520 --> 2:15:47.880]  from realtors and everyone is reducing prices right now now that that figure
[2:15:47.880 --> 2:15:52.360]  you threw out earlier the 20% or so forth we we saw a reduction over the
[2:15:52.360 --> 2:15:58.600]  last year of 20 to 30% in not in prices but in reduction of sales
[2:15:58.600 --> 2:16:02.920]  themselves we saw we saw a rise of about the same amount in number of
[2:16:02.920 --> 2:16:08.000]  listings we saw a decrease in sales themselves of that much but the
[2:16:08.000 --> 2:16:12.200]  price has not been weakened until just recently we've seen the last three to
[2:16:12.200 --> 2:16:17.200]  four weeks prices coming down more more so than we've ever seen before and
[2:16:17.200 --> 2:16:20.640]  you're a realtor keep breaking down those numbers for people what that means
[2:16:20.640 --> 2:16:23.880]  and supposedly the best city in the country for real estate and business
[2:16:23.880 --> 2:16:28.840]  where we're seeing a sudden plunge yeah when when when Austin started being
[2:16:28.840 --> 2:16:32.600]  affected and that's what I'm saying in the last month I would say we're
[2:16:32.600 --> 2:16:36.960]  starting to really be affected and and the million dollar houses and so forth
[2:16:36.960 --> 2:16:41.560]  were first affected when we first went into this over a year ago and and now
[2:16:41.560 --> 2:16:44.720]  we're seeing it move into hundred thousand two hundred thousand dollar
[2:16:44.720 --> 2:16:49.120]  houses that are we're getting emails daily five to ten emails from different
[2:16:49.120 --> 2:16:53.840]  realtor saying reduced here increase of commission here and so forth and so it's
[2:16:53.840 --> 2:16:58.680]  having an effect right now in in the end probably one of the prime premier real
[2:16:58.680 --> 2:17:03.000]  estate markets in the country which is Austin Texas what does that mean to you
[2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:06.800]  well we're going to see we've been I've been through this tight month we call it
[2:17:06.800 --> 2:17:12.160]  a tight money period and that means credit is going to be not easy to get
[2:17:12.160 --> 2:17:18.280]  we rely on some well-heeled private investors to make some of our loans so
[2:17:18.280 --> 2:17:22.600]  we're outside the the normal mortgage market in some of our transactions and
[2:17:22.600 --> 2:17:27.040]  so we do take some of our mortgage business and sales to private
[2:17:27.040 --> 2:17:32.200]  individuals that's one way to deal in a market like this without depending on
[2:17:32.200 --> 2:17:39.560]  the existing the traditional credit lines now going from Main Street to the
[2:17:39.560 --> 2:17:44.800]  larger perspective give us your perspective you know live in a while
[2:17:44.800 --> 2:17:50.120]  seeing seeing markets go up and down similarities with this market to old
[2:17:50.120 --> 2:17:55.440]  down times and then anything different you're seeing this time well here here
[2:17:55.440 --> 2:17:59.840]  is different I think the financial terrorism which all have set out very
[2:17:59.840 --> 2:18:06.480]  very very well in detail is something I've never seen before we've had down
[2:18:06.480 --> 2:18:10.440]  declines before and recessions and so forth before but we've never had these
[2:18:10.440 --> 2:18:13.440]  pronouncement especially by the president when he the president started
[2:18:13.440 --> 2:18:17.520]  threatening about pension funds and things like that now now one of the
[2:18:17.520 --> 2:18:24.560]  precursors to this was about a year ago a main investment in manager I think it
[2:18:24.560 --> 2:18:27.720]  might have been Goldman Sachs or one of those companies out of New York approached
[2:18:27.720 --> 2:18:33.840]  our our teachers retirement pension fund and it was about in April of 2007 that
[2:18:33.840 --> 2:18:39.280]  they decided to to give that that investment company 30 billion dollars
[2:18:39.280 --> 2:18:44.440]  out of the Texas teacher retirement fund to and in the article the way they
[2:18:44.440 --> 2:18:47.720]  portrayed the investments they said these would be more risky types of
[2:18:47.720 --> 2:18:53.560]  investments and I'm sure that they meant derivative types of of investments that
[2:18:53.560 --> 2:18:57.480]  they invested that was that's right we've had looting of state and federal and
[2:18:57.480 --> 2:19:01.480]  private pensions we've had them change the laws so companies can do that and so
[2:19:01.480 --> 2:19:05.760]  you've also had a quiet shift into that area well mark to model is what they've
[2:19:05.760 --> 2:19:11.280]  been using to to estimate a future value of a derivative and they're using an
[2:19:11.280 --> 2:19:16.320]  algorithm and and they can concoct any algorithm they want to project into the
[2:19:16.320 --> 2:19:19.360]  future and Ryan was using the same technique let's talk about that what's
[2:19:19.360 --> 2:19:22.800]  the public going to do when they learn that it isn't just the bailouts that
[2:19:22.800 --> 2:19:26.520]  they've already sucked your police fireman school teacher pensions drive

[2:22:32.880 --> 2:22:38.400]  act of war against this country the enemy struck America on September 11th but
[2:22:38.400 --> 2:22:43.080]  who is the enemy? Bin Laden this is his ammo we have to look to the Middle East we
[2:22:43.080 --> 2:22:47.160]  have to look to his home of Bin Laden fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to
[2:22:47.160 --> 2:22:51.000]  take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the
[2:22:51.000 --> 2:22:54.840]  United States. Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again
[2:22:54.840 --> 2:23:00.760]  very much engaged in spying in and on the US. I'm aware that some Israeli
[2:23:00.760 --> 2:23:05.280]  citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA the hijackers
[2:23:05.280 --> 2:23:09.080]  ties to the FBI the Saudi Arabian connection the Israeli intelligence
[2:23:09.080 --> 2:23:12.680]  network warnings and war games the shadow government and much much more

[2:24:05.200 --> 2:24:10.640]  a lot of ways we are reaching out George Butler is a real estate agent also a
[2:24:10.640 --> 2:24:14.920]  broker and he has been working in it for a long time we were getting into
[2:24:14.920 --> 2:24:18.520]  pensions and that's a whole area I haven't really gotten into during all
[2:24:18.520 --> 2:24:22.440]  this they have already sucked those dry come in and paid off local politicians
[2:24:22.440 --> 2:24:28.000]  put that into their banking system then leveraged it out and I mean anyway you
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:31.800]  cut it it's going to be a depression or a mega depression on the good end of
[2:24:31.800 --> 2:24:35.320]  depression on the bad end of mega depression or calling in US military
[2:24:35.320 --> 2:24:38.560]  against the American people I mean I can't believe this is even happening I
[2:24:38.560 --> 2:24:42.760]  mean I intellectually knew they were setting up for it George but to see it
[2:24:42.760 --> 2:24:47.440]  unfolding continue with the pensions this is a prime example here the teacher
[2:24:47.440 --> 2:24:51.960]  retirement system takes a hit on Lehman Brothers stock holdings this
[2:24:51.960 --> 2:24:57.480]  reported in our local American statesman by the staff Robert Elder wrote this
[2:24:57.480 --> 2:25:01.640]  article US Securities and Exchange Commission filing show that the
[2:25:01.640 --> 2:25:06.360]  retirement system ramped up its holding starting in March when Lehman stock was
[2:25:06.360 --> 2:25:10.920]  trading near $50 per share at the time the system held about 1 million shares
[2:25:10.920 --> 2:25:16.080]  the retirement system then went on a buying spree raising its stake to 4.3
[2:25:16.080 --> 2:25:20.600]  million shares by June 30th during those four months however Lehman stock fell
[2:25:20.600 --> 2:25:27.240]  below $20 per share a 60% drop they are hustling these these retirement funds
[2:25:27.240 --> 2:25:31.720]  into the hundreds of millions of dollars and in some cases billions they
[2:25:31.720 --> 2:25:35.640]  have they stand to lose and that's all over the country all over the world this
[2:25:35.640 --> 2:25:39.120]  is just right here in Austin Texas and this is the teacher's retirement should
[2:25:39.120 --> 2:25:43.360]  be raising hell about how these funds have been invested for on their behalf
[2:25:43.360 --> 2:25:47.160]  remember I got into risky to risky investments because the derivative
[2:25:47.160 --> 2:25:51.120]  thing needed to be fed remember Orange County alone five years ago when
[2:25:51.120 --> 2:25:54.080]  hundreds of millions of dollars got sucked out and they found it was quote
[2:25:54.080 --> 2:25:57.400]  risky investments they were derivatives again that's why they then started
[2:25:57.400 --> 2:26:02.520]  sucking other pension funds dry was to try to pump that bubble up and no
[2:26:02.520 --> 2:26:06.680]  amount of pumping will fix it all it will do is steal your investments and
[2:26:06.680 --> 2:26:11.200]  devalue your currency exactly what what they've done is use this mark to model
[2:26:11.200 --> 2:26:14.680]  accounting method now that is one thing I think that in this bill that they're
[2:26:14.680 --> 2:26:19.360]  trying to get back to a mark to mark to market mark to market system of accounting
[2:26:19.360 --> 2:26:24.240]  versus a mark to model the mark to model enabled these pension funds I mean
[2:26:24.240 --> 2:26:28.640]  these investment funds and mutual funds and Lehman brothers and so forth to use
[2:26:28.640 --> 2:26:33.560]  on the very esoteric accounting method to to project into the future what they
[2:26:33.560 --> 2:26:37.760]  thought that those derivatives would be worth and I think they're just revising
[2:26:37.760 --> 2:26:41.520]  the models just to stay solvent now now while we talk about what's happening in
[2:26:41.520 --> 2:26:47.520]  the international banking centers you know the the the the finance markets in
[2:26:47.520 --> 2:26:52.840]  the finance economy meanwhile again here in Austin I am seeing the economy
[2:26:52.840 --> 2:26:57.760]  contract fast I mean it's like an overnight effect I mean restaurants that
[2:26:57.760 --> 2:27:01.600]  six months ago I could never get into you know because I'd be at work so I
[2:27:01.600 --> 2:27:03.880]  want to go eat at this you know restaurant and it would always be too
[2:27:03.880 --> 2:27:07.680]  full to get into now I went one of these restaurants a few nights ago and it was
[2:27:07.680 --> 2:27:11.720]  about half full I mean we're seeing an immediate effect yeah when you when you're
[2:27:11.720 --> 2:27:15.320]  saying a credit expansion has a multiplier effect because it puts money
[2:27:15.320 --> 2:27:18.960]  into other people's hands they in turn spend the money and buy and put in
[2:27:18.960 --> 2:27:22.560]  investments well the the opposite is real is true when you have a contract
[2:27:22.560 --> 2:27:26.280]  contraction of credit and that's what we're experiencing right now and the
[2:27:26.280 --> 2:27:30.800]  contraction does create more of a dynamic of contracting just like it would
[2:27:30.800 --> 2:27:35.960]  on the upside George we've seen this whole police state being prepared
[2:27:35.960 --> 2:27:39.720]  gearing up the government saying they're doing it for financial panic years
[2:27:39.720 --> 2:27:43.920]  ago while they carry out the financial operations they know will bring it to
[2:27:43.920 --> 2:27:49.200]  fruition what does your gut tell you when this is really going to start
[2:27:49.200 --> 2:27:54.960]  breaking loose and get so bad that it can't be ignored well I think you
[2:27:54.960 --> 2:28:00.240]  probably have a better handle on that than I do there have been reports of
[2:28:00.240 --> 2:28:03.800]  bringing what some of units home from overseas that would do street you and
[2:28:03.800 --> 2:28:08.200]  you and Mike Hansen did some wonderful videoing down in Kingsville and I think
[2:28:08.200 --> 2:28:12.920]  you you tried to do some in San Antonio but did they not resist that they can
[2:28:12.920 --> 2:28:19.000]  put guns to our heads and they did so so y'all y'all had a far warning of some
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:24.280]  of this so all I can all I can say is that keep your ear to the ground and
[2:28:24.280 --> 2:28:27.480]  listen to some of these units that of the National Guard and some of the
[2:28:27.480 --> 2:28:31.920]  reserve units and an active army units should give us some advanced notice but
[2:28:31.920 --> 2:28:34.560]  I don't think it's coming well they've been saying they've been saying they've
[2:28:34.560 --> 2:28:38.560]  been saying now it's admitted what we said to the decade ago no we are here
[2:28:38.560 --> 2:28:42.360]  for you we're here to engage the American people well they they have been
[2:28:42.360 --> 2:28:46.360]  training in in regular Army units and National Guard units they've been
[2:28:46.360 --> 2:28:51.400]  training for riot control and crowd control and civilian unrest and riot and
[2:28:51.400 --> 2:28:56.000]  and and those those those guys I saw in St. Paul were terrible those Darth Vader
[2:28:56.000 --> 2:28:59.680]  uniform that's right they remain spirited to you and Richard almost got
[2:28:59.680 --> 2:29:02.840]  arrested a few times they would just arrest all peaceful crowds they let's
[2:29:02.840 --> 2:29:05.640]  briefly talk about that we get back at anything else you want to cover George
[2:29:05.640 --> 2:29:09.680]  and then take phone calls Ben Robert Rick and others okay fine I think we made
[2:29:09.680 --> 2:29:14.320]  that video available to you just recently fantastic alright we'll be we'll be
[2:29:14.320 --> 2:29:17.600]  right back stay with us after this quick break in fact I'm gonna skip this break
[2:29:17.600 --> 2:29:21.480]  I'm gonna skip it for info works listeners we're yeah let's continue behind
[2:29:21.480 --> 2:29:25.040]  the scenes with just the web folks watching and for folks listening at
[2:29:25.040 --> 2:29:28.240]  info works dot com on those streams what's some of the stuff you want to
[2:29:28.240 --> 2:29:34.360]  talk about well you know you bring up a very interesting subject and and not
[2:29:34.360 --> 2:29:38.360]  only are we caught up in in the dynamics of everyday living and surviving and
[2:29:38.360 --> 2:29:42.960]  trying to discern and and you could say navigate our way through this changing
[2:29:42.960 --> 2:29:46.880]  these changing events which are tumultuous and very wicked and very
[2:29:46.880 --> 2:29:52.160]  dangerous but but the delusional aspect of this is always there and you've been
[2:29:52.160 --> 2:29:56.240]  touching on that recently and I think I think your insight in that area I think
[2:29:56.240 --> 2:29:58.640]  it's very good well I'm gonna get your insight as I know you've studied
[2:29:58.640 --> 2:30:04.240]  psychology but people are in willful denial yes men I know wealthy people I
[2:30:04.240 --> 2:30:08.400]  know upper middle class and then just average folks I'll say hey what do you
[2:30:08.400 --> 2:30:11.720]  think about what's happening and they're like I don't want to hear about it you
[2:30:11.720 --> 2:30:15.760]  know I know about your show and I don't want to hear negativity it's not
[2:30:15.760 --> 2:30:19.960]  negative I mean if your legs broken you got to fix it and and and so there's
[2:30:19.960 --> 2:30:24.080]  this the establishment is being encouraged to carry this out because they
[2:30:24.080 --> 2:30:28.720]  know the public has been put in a catatonic state yes that that state is
[2:30:28.720 --> 2:30:33.320]  one that is a is one of comfort it's just a psychologist and even pop
[2:30:33.320 --> 2:30:37.480]  psychology have described as a comfort zone they don't want to disturb that you
[2:30:37.480 --> 2:30:41.200]  bring some things to them that it's upsetting to them it makes them unhappy
[2:30:41.200 --> 2:30:45.960]  but they they need to wake up and start confronting exactly what you're saying
[2:30:45.960 --> 2:30:50.880]  and you have you have in your style I'll say that you've hit them right
[2:30:50.880 --> 2:30:56.640]  between you wake up well I mean because because sometimes that is the best
[2:30:56.640 --> 2:30:59.880]  method well there's different you know different ways for different people
[2:30:59.880 --> 2:31:03.880]  yes for different folks you know many different ways of thinking make the
[2:31:03.880 --> 2:31:08.200]  world go around I just hit people from the honest perspective that I'm freaked
[2:31:08.200 --> 2:31:12.040]  out by this and I know history and I know what's happening currently is is
[2:31:12.040 --> 2:31:16.400]  is nightmarish and so that's why I get so upset but you know it the folks that
[2:31:16.400 --> 2:31:19.880]  are smooth about it like yourself or low-key like Ron Paul that's also very
[2:31:19.880 --> 2:31:23.600]  effective and and I also want to talk about the fact that we've laid this out
[2:31:23.600 --> 2:31:27.080]  and made these predictions so now people are actually listening yeah your
[2:31:27.080 --> 2:31:30.760]  credibility has soared because you've been saying this for years and then
[2:31:30.760 --> 2:31:33.680]  people said oh that's just a bunch of bull and now they're saying uh-oh and
[2:31:33.680 --> 2:31:37.800]  they're coming in and back to you and listening to you and supporting you now
[2:31:37.800 --> 2:31:40.960]  unlike they ever have but I mean not just myself I mean well everyone in the
[2:31:40.960 --> 2:31:44.840]  in this in this area but but really the alternative media you've been at the
[2:31:44.840 --> 2:31:48.880]  forefront of many and 9-11 for sure you're the you're the founding well
[2:31:48.880 --> 2:31:51.960]  we're gonna know that we're gonna come back to the full audience and then let's
[2:31:51.960 --> 2:31:57.240]  go through your your take on the comfort zone the cognitive dissonance people
[2:31:57.240 --> 2:32:00.800]  staying in a little bubble and they don't want you to come into it let's get
[2:32:00.800 --> 2:32:04.680]  into what it'll look like if we do have a true breakdown there's already gas
[2:32:04.680 --> 2:32:07.820]  shortages already banking problems we're already seeing it what would a
[2:32:07.820 --> 2:32:12.480]  depression like 29 look like and then we'll take us some phone calls and and
[2:32:12.480 --> 2:32:17.520]  well first as we said before we went to break first let's get into what you saw
[2:32:17.520 --> 2:32:22.920]  in Minneapolis St. Paul for the RNC as an eyewitness briefly and then we'll get
[2:32:22.920 --> 2:32:27.240]  into the psychology and then take phone calls here we go back to the main
[2:32:27.240 --> 2:32:37.000]  audience
[2:32:37.000 --> 2:32:42.920]  Peter Schiff one of Ron Paul's main economic advisors and Ron Paul's got
[2:32:42.920 --> 2:32:48.320]  international awards for economics papers himself from Von Mises and others
[2:32:48.320 --> 2:32:54.160]  Institute so this is a quiet expert and I'm read a lot of his papers and seen him
[2:32:54.160 --> 2:32:58.000]  on international and national television so Peter Schiff his maiden voyage with
[2:32:58.000 --> 2:33:02.480]  us coming up in about 27 minutes I do want to get to your phone calls at
[2:33:02.480 --> 2:33:08.000]  800-25 at 99231 but I tried to get Richard Reeves in here who's on
[2:33:08.000 --> 2:33:12.000]  camera work for us and who's driven us in DC and Dallas and at some other
[2:33:12.000 --> 2:33:17.400]  events but he he just wants you to have Butler on and so I was meaning to get
[2:33:17.400 --> 2:33:20.720]  you on about that but then all this financial stuff happened but just in a
[2:33:20.720 --> 2:33:25.640]  nutshell Reeves told me you guys almost got arrested repeatedly the police were
[2:33:25.640 --> 2:33:30.120]  clearly targeting peaceful crowds in a nutshell what did you witness at the RNC
[2:33:30.120 --> 2:33:36.440]  in Minneapolis St. Paul well I I begin to witness it not at the as close in
[2:33:36.440 --> 2:33:40.200]  Richard went right in there with my camera and got some footage that was
[2:33:40.200 --> 2:33:44.880]  unbelievable but I saw it from a little bit further back but but there was the
[2:33:44.880 --> 2:33:50.680]  Darth Vader a riot control and they encircled before the the speeches were
[2:33:50.680 --> 2:33:54.800]  over and right in front of the state Capitol of St. Paul the state Capitol
[2:33:54.800 --> 2:33:58.640]  of Minnesota they encircled the whole crowd and I said oh my gosh what are we
[2:33:58.640 --> 2:34:02.680]  in for and it was hell getting out of that circle once they encircled us but
[2:34:02.680 --> 2:34:06.440]  Richard went right in and waited in there and got right close in and at the
[2:34:06.440 --> 2:34:11.400]  very end we went back to to find that the the last remnants of that
[2:34:11.400 --> 2:34:15.360]  demonstrate of those demonstrators we found them on the parked on the Marion
[2:34:15.360 --> 2:34:20.680]  Bridge surrounded handcuffed and they'd been spent pepper sprayed surrounded by
[2:34:20.680 --> 2:34:26.280]  EMS vehicles and the and the police were celebrating this great victory eating
[2:34:26.280 --> 2:34:30.520]  eating little Twinkies or whatever and drinking Coca-Cola you know I mean they
[2:34:30.520 --> 2:34:34.800]  were they were really you know what I mean they got a kick out of doing these
[2:34:34.800 --> 2:34:38.720]  peaceful demonstrators and then lying to the media and saying they were violent
[2:34:38.720 --> 2:34:42.920]  showing a few videos of anarchist who they never arrested who had some
[2:34:42.920 --> 2:34:46.320]  witnesses and this report by mainstream media said anarchist would come from
[2:34:46.320 --> 2:34:49.600]  behind the police line bash your police car window out and run back into the
[2:34:49.600 --> 2:34:53.040]  cops now they've been caught provocaturing and police have been
[2:34:53.040 --> 2:34:57.480]  caught dressed up like anarchist before did did you see any of that that Richard
[2:34:57.480 --> 2:35:00.680]  went in on Monday we didn't get in there until late Monday evening and I was
[2:35:00.680 --> 2:35:04.720]  only part of the demonstration on Thursday but Richard was was in there
[2:35:04.720 --> 2:35:09.040]  and he escaped through a parking garage he has quite a story where he ducked
[2:35:09.040 --> 2:35:12.120]  out of the crowd they were encircling them and getting ready to arrest the
[2:35:12.120 --> 2:35:15.920]  whole bunch of right and he reports the other stage and he went through a
[2:35:15.920 --> 2:35:20.200]  building and it led to a parking garage and they weren't covered the police had
[2:35:20.200 --> 2:35:23.600]  that not covered and he got through that parking garage out to the outside of the
[2:35:23.600 --> 2:35:29.320]  circle and but but on Thursday I ordered him out of there okay and I told him I
[2:35:29.320 --> 2:35:34.320]  said Richard I see him coming in I was outside the circle at that time and I
[2:35:34.320 --> 2:35:38.600]  was safe so to speak I said Richard I ordered you out of here period you get
[2:35:38.600 --> 2:35:42.240]  out of there now you know what I mean and he said yes sir and I'm a little
[2:35:42.240 --> 2:35:46.480]  older than he is so seniority worked on that and he got out and you know how he
[2:35:46.480 --> 2:35:51.560]  got out Alex he walked out with some office workers that had still been
[2:35:51.560 --> 2:35:56.000]  behind the lines inside the encirclement because for those that don't know they
[2:35:56.000 --> 2:35:59.800]  just arrest everybody yes and he walked out with them like he was part of the
[2:35:59.800 --> 2:36:03.760]  office worker group and they let him down and that sends the message don't be
[2:36:03.760 --> 2:36:07.640]  part of protests don't come out to events your first amendment your right to
[2:36:07.640 --> 2:36:11.080]  assemble and of the feds have to they hire these anarchists in some cases the
[2:36:11.080 --> 2:36:14.440]  anarchists do it on their own I'm not saying all anarchist groups but you know
[2:36:14.440 --> 2:36:22.040]  clearly the ones that are doing this any other points from the RNC well the the
[2:36:22.040 --> 2:36:27.160]  mesmerizing inside we saw Palin speak on Wednesday and Thursday evening I was
[2:36:27.160 --> 2:36:30.320]  sitting there and there was one person in that whole auditorium that did not
[2:36:30.320 --> 2:36:35.040]  stand it did not clap for McCain and that was me I would not because of what I
[2:36:35.040 --> 2:36:39.200]  know about the gentleman and especially the POW problem of not going back and
[2:36:39.200 --> 2:36:44.000]  getting our POWs back well was this all mass mind control yes that exactly it
[2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:48.040]  was this cult of personality that was operating on such a scale that it was
[2:36:48.040 --> 2:36:53.520]  overwhelming to me depressing in a way but to see that many people go for this
[2:36:53.520 --> 2:36:57.560]  losing their minds yes yes just go you know crazy because they want to jump on
[2:36:57.560 --> 2:37:01.040]  the power well listen I'm hearing neocons calling the shows yeah and they go
[2:37:01.040 --> 2:37:05.280]  she's still a genius it's a trick when she acts stupid she's going to show them
[2:37:05.280 --> 2:37:09.080]  tonight and no we're not saying we're for Obama folks were saying it's culture
[2:37:09.080 --> 2:37:13.960]  personality with Palin and Obama yes both men run nothing at both sides they
[2:37:13.960 --> 2:37:17.760]  did it in Denver and they did it in St. Paul and his culture personality and
[2:37:17.760 --> 2:37:21.720]  they've got everybody mindwashed and going right speaking of psychology you've
[2:37:21.720 --> 2:37:25.640]  studied this yes a lot of the public's breaking out of their box and then they
[2:37:25.640 --> 2:37:29.440]  engage in financial terrorism and some went back into it but Congress is afraid
[2:37:29.440 --> 2:37:31.840]  of being blamed for a depression so they're gonna probably go along with
[2:37:31.840 --> 2:37:34.680]  this and then all the other fleecing is going to go on that will devalue the
[2:37:34.680 --> 2:37:39.080]  currency in your your pension funds but but I mean just briefly the psychology
[2:37:39.080 --> 2:37:43.560]  of people that live in denial I know they buy into a worldview and then they
[2:37:43.560 --> 2:37:47.720]  will defend that worldview no matter what all the evidence shows to their own
[2:37:47.720 --> 2:37:51.080]  detriment can you speak to that psychology yes I can what what they're
[2:37:51.080 --> 2:37:55.760]  actually supporting is the false self and we've moved away from that at birth
[2:37:55.760 --> 2:37:59.880]  and we've been fed by our families and other people that are suffering in the
[2:37:59.880 --> 2:38:04.080]  same mode and it's a mode of delusion and it's play acting's what I call it
[2:38:04.080 --> 2:38:09.080]  exactly exactly and that personality that identity of who we think we are is a
[2:38:09.080 --> 2:38:13.640]  false self and it's fed by what's what's wrong in the world not what's right and
[2:38:13.640 --> 2:38:18.560]  I maintain that forgiveness can bring you out of that and establish a greater
[2:38:18.560 --> 2:38:24.280]  objectivity and and and non-judgment and forgiveness can of self and others can
[2:38:24.280 --> 2:38:29.320]  can create a dynamic that is awakening it's awakening dynamic that's right a
[2:38:29.320 --> 2:38:34.400]  lot of people and it's very complex but just to simply you know put a little
[2:38:34.400 --> 2:38:39.440]  feeler into this this this whole delusional system people think if
[2:38:39.440 --> 2:38:44.120]  you're warning about something that they're doing you a favor even listening
[2:38:44.120 --> 2:38:48.440]  and that somehow you're trying to show off to them because they're so self-centered
[2:38:48.440 --> 2:38:52.800]  they've been trained to be self-centered they can't imagine someone would have
[2:38:52.800 --> 2:38:57.520]  an instinct to want to warn them and help them I mean it's sick yeah it's sick
[2:38:57.520 --> 2:39:02.720]  but it's also frustrating at times is it not oh very you you have a heart that
[2:39:02.720 --> 2:39:06.960]  wants to help people in such a powerful way that when they don't respond
[2:39:06.960 --> 2:39:10.000]  immediately sometimes it can be frustrating but that's where all
[2:39:10.000 --> 2:39:14.600]  frustrating but patience is love and that's the hardest thing it only takes a
[2:39:14.600 --> 2:39:19.280]  little time to learn it because you know it's a thing that takes time for sure
[2:39:19.280 --> 2:39:23.040]  mainly and that's patience with one another because humans are not like
[2:39:23.040 --> 2:39:27.080]  light bulbs you turn off and on that takes time to work with them and people
[2:39:27.080 --> 2:39:30.440]  that it that have turned been turned off of you five years ago or your friends
[2:39:30.440 --> 2:39:34.800]  today well that's why I don't get mad at people I just feel sorry for them and I
[2:39:34.800 --> 2:39:37.840]  try to warn them or show them something and and you know they disagree that's
[2:39:37.840 --> 2:39:41.280]  fine but if they get that weird self-assured you know what eating
[2:39:41.280 --> 2:39:46.120]  bread on their face some of like pleasure and or you know so what or you
[2:39:46.120 --> 2:39:50.000]  tell some yuppies hey they're gonna take our existing roads we paid for and
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:53.160]  give them to a foreign corporation they'll just laugh and say so what like
[2:39:53.160 --> 2:39:58.000]  saying so what gives them power over it yeah there's an arrogance there but it's
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:01.120]  not the real self that's speaking it's this false glorified self that's
[2:40:01.120 --> 2:40:04.800]  interacting with you and and that's really the cause of warfare before we
[2:40:04.800 --> 2:40:09.760]  have these abstracted cells fighting with abstracted selves they're not real
[2:40:09.760 --> 2:40:14.920]  identities it's a conjured up construction it's an imagined identity of
[2:40:14.920 --> 2:40:19.040]  who people you always talk about that and and it's very strange when you lose
[2:40:19.040 --> 2:40:22.960]  more and more of that and then the people take my aggression of my fury is an
[2:40:22.960 --> 2:40:27.120]  ego-driven thing it's the opposite I know it is an instinct driven you know
[2:40:27.120 --> 2:40:32.280]  thing out of basic survival but but but I'm so many people I mean I remember
[2:40:32.280 --> 2:40:35.280]  being three years old I talk about this a lot and in real and I was out on the
[2:40:35.280 --> 2:40:38.480]  back porch by myself playing and I was a superhero jumping on and off the back
[2:40:38.480 --> 2:40:43.280]  porch remember was Batman or Superman and it was a sunny day and I had this huge
[2:40:43.280 --> 2:40:46.840]  like a thunderbolt hit me and it said you're play acting you're not really
[2:40:46.840 --> 2:40:51.720]  this superhero and you're not the whole world you are just a tiny spark of life
[2:40:51.720 --> 2:40:54.480]  for a short period of time it wasn't a child's thought it was like this whole
[2:40:54.480 --> 2:40:58.640]  download and and I realized that I was you know just this little flotsam and
[2:40:58.640 --> 2:41:03.000]  jetsam on the sea of humanity and time and thousands of years and everybody
[2:41:03.000 --> 2:41:07.520]  that had come and gone and those that were gonna come in the future and and it
[2:41:07.520 --> 2:41:11.360]  wasn't crushing it was liberating and then my whole life I realized that other
[2:41:11.360 --> 2:41:16.760]  people are still playing dress-up they're still imagining they're still but
[2:41:16.760 --> 2:41:21.920]  that's what trinkets and baubles and signets and symbols are all about is is
[2:41:21.920 --> 2:41:26.520]  like you said this false template unconscious people yes you you have a
[2:41:26.520 --> 2:41:31.880]  connection to reality that not many people have well no you you see it but
[2:41:31.880 --> 2:41:35.360]  because you have this connection and your studies over the years of the world
[2:41:35.360 --> 2:41:39.920]  system then you can see how evil that it really is well the elites are self
[2:41:39.920 --> 2:41:43.360]  actualized though I mean I mean the elites also are conscious and
[2:41:43.360 --> 2:41:47.080]  understanding a mechanical way but it's very cold with them but when you see it
[2:41:47.080 --> 2:41:52.480]  at the depth and and you see the the the beast to the to the center I mean to
[2:41:52.480 --> 2:41:55.720]  the depth that that not not many people see it and I see it in the same way
[2:41:55.720 --> 2:42:01.000]  okay but but and it's upsetting to us to see it like that and then trying to
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:04.640]  reach out to people and they're not responding like we want to be to do
[2:42:04.640 --> 2:42:11.520]  sometimes it can be frustrating absolutely I wanted to get into a few
[2:42:11.520 --> 2:42:14.040]  other issues but let's go ahead and take some calls well before we go to calls
[2:42:14.040 --> 2:42:17.120]  any other issues you wanted to bring up oh you got hundreds of things here on
[2:42:17.120 --> 2:42:20.320]  the computer to talk about oh yeah I'm just I just brought up that we've still
[2:42:20.320 --> 2:42:24.520]  got the bell out and they they're talking about a rescue bill now are you
[2:42:24.520 --> 2:42:29.160]  gonna be watching the Palin yes I will Biden yes Palin comes from a very
[2:42:29.160 --> 2:42:35.160]  religious background and so that's where and maybe a dominanism perhaps of
[2:42:35.160 --> 2:42:40.120]  taking a religious thought and trying to enact that into law that's basically
[2:42:40.120 --> 2:42:45.520]  that I well she certainly uses that as a front to get support yes I think with
[2:42:45.520 --> 2:42:48.900]  her it's just like a beauty pageant it's all completely fake but that she's
[2:42:48.900 --> 2:42:52.080]  bought into it well you know you know the coverage that you gave on the on
[2:42:52.080 --> 2:42:56.440]  Georgia the response that she gave about the Russians was totally off the wall
[2:42:56.440 --> 2:42:59.120]  well she said we need to go ahead and have war I mean that that was that she
[2:42:59.120 --> 2:43:04.960]  said we need to have Russia that that is totally totally gosh I can't I can't
[2:43:04.960 --> 2:43:09.160]  describe well I mean also you know what let's go where the comment that was I'm
[2:43:09.160 --> 2:43:12.800]  meant to do this and I'm gonna do it not to make fun of her but to illustrate
[2:43:12.800 --> 2:43:18.160]  that literally the first let's play Miss South Carolina where she just throws
[2:43:18.160 --> 2:43:22.080]  out a bunch of mismatched stuff terms she heard has nothing to do with the
[2:43:22.080 --> 2:43:27.520]  question and you watch Sarah Palin and as long as she's giving you some fake
[2:43:27.520 --> 2:43:31.320]  conservative line it sounds eloquent but but she's reading off a teleprompter
[2:43:31.320 --> 2:43:34.240]  folks okay then they make a big deal that all the teleprompter broke and all
[2:43:34.240 --> 2:43:38.400]  this crap she had written prepared I mean this is all about oh look she can
[2:43:38.400 --> 2:43:42.120]  talk on her own my god this is so amazing that the all these people are
[2:43:42.120 --> 2:43:47.160]  reading prepared speeches now when she does get an interview and people say
[2:43:47.160 --> 2:43:50.360]  well what about the Bush doctrine they say oh well that's a liberal media trick
[2:43:50.360 --> 2:43:53.480]  to make her look down that's you know that's too complex for her to know well
[2:43:53.480 --> 2:43:57.200]  know the Bush doctrine is preemptive war global government towards your evil but
[2:43:57.200 --> 2:44:01.240]  you know she she just totally but but but John you have that clip of her on
[2:44:01.240 --> 2:44:05.000]  Katy Curry let's play that second let's play Miss South Carolina first here it
[2:44:05.000 --> 2:44:09.880]  is recent polls have shown a fifth of Americans can't locate the US on a
[2:44:09.880 --> 2:44:18.320]  world map why do you think this is I personally believe that US Americans are
[2:44:18.320 --> 2:44:25.960]  unable to do so because some people out there in our nation don't have bounce
[2:44:25.960 --> 2:44:32.400]  and I believe that our education like such as in South Africa and Iraq
[2:44:32.400 --> 2:44:38.800]  everywhere like such as and I believe that they should our education over here
[2:44:38.800 --> 2:44:44.360]  in the US should help the US or should help South Africa it should help that
[2:44:44.360 --> 2:44:50.600]  Iraq Asian countries so we will be able to build up our future or thank you very
[2:44:50.600 --> 2:44:55.920]  much South Carolina and by the way she's a genius compared to a lot of people you
[2:44:55.920 --> 2:44:59.520]  talked to men and women now they don't even know what states are they don't
[2:44:59.520 --> 2:45:02.920]  even know what different forms of government are and it doesn't give me
[2:45:02.920 --> 2:45:06.840]  any pleasure like I'm some smart guy see the globalist and their minions they
[2:45:06.840 --> 2:45:11.080]  enjoy the ignorance of the public they revel in how people are dumb they enjoy
[2:45:11.080 --> 2:45:14.000]  conning they think they're part of the system though they're being crushed too
[2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:18.480]  most of them but but but then those of us that do care and understand that what
[2:45:18.480 --> 2:45:21.160]  comes around goes around and that we can't be a free society with all this
[2:45:21.160 --> 2:45:25.560]  idiocy we're just horrified at this you try to talk to somebody like Miss South
[2:45:25.560 --> 2:45:30.080]  Carolina and they're everywhere they will just arrogantly snicker at you and
[2:45:30.080 --> 2:45:35.760]  you know shake some bobbles at you some bling and say look I have bling I have
[2:45:35.760 --> 2:45:40.480]  booty now let's go ahead and play and listen how similar she is Sarah Palin
[2:45:40.480 --> 2:45:48.160]  with with Miss South Carolina here it is you've cited Alaska's proximity to
[2:45:48.160 --> 2:45:52.360]  Russia as part of your foreign policy experience what did you mean by that
[2:45:52.360 --> 2:45:58.120]  that Alaska has a very narrow maritime border between a foreign country Russia
[2:45:58.120 --> 2:46:05.200]  and on our other side the land boundary that we have with Canada it's funny that
[2:46:05.200 --> 2:46:12.480]  a comment like that was kind of made to care I don't know you know reporters
[2:46:12.480 --> 2:46:19.600]  yeah mocked I guess that's the word yeah well explain to me why that enhances
[2:46:19.600 --> 2:46:25.000]  your foreign policy credentials well it certainly does because our our next-door
[2:46:25.000 --> 2:46:30.040]  neighbors are foreign countries they're in the state that I am the executive of
[2:46:30.040 --> 2:46:34.680]  and have you ever been involved with any negotiations for example with the
[2:46:34.680 --> 2:46:39.880]  Russians we have trade missions back and forth we do it's very important when
[2:46:39.880 --> 2:46:44.800]  you consider even national security issues with Russia as Putin rears his
[2:46:44.800 --> 2:46:50.480]  head and comes into the airspace of the United States of America where do they
[2:46:50.480 --> 2:46:56.400]  go it's Alaska it's just right over the border it is from Alaska that we send
[2:46:56.400 --> 2:47:03.040]  those out to make sure that an eye is being kept on this very powerful nation
[2:47:03.040 --> 2:47:10.320]  Russia because they are right there they are right next to to our state in fact I
[2:47:10.320 --> 2:47:15.160]  sent you a bunch of clips I know last week John I never that's not the one
[2:47:15.160 --> 2:47:20.520]  it's the one where she sounds just like I sent you a bunch I should have a week
[2:47:20.520 --> 2:47:23.320]  ago when I sent it to you I knew the clips but I sent you too many that's not
[2:47:23.320 --> 2:47:27.560]  the one there's another one with her where she sounds just like Miss South
[2:47:27.560 --> 2:47:32.560]  Carolina I'll find it on YouTube and play it and I mean she's just like and
[2:47:32.560 --> 2:47:38.240]  then we do it in the trade and that's how we friends and helping John you got
[2:47:38.240 --> 2:47:43.880]  some more Sarah Palin clips right pretty good yeah well I mean that was
[2:47:43.880 --> 2:47:47.560]  actually it you know I mean not good but but you know made up I mean but that's
[2:47:47.560 --> 2:47:52.400]  that's that's we got the airspace we got the border there go across there we're
[2:47:52.400 --> 2:47:57.080]  gonna invade Russia well we can find the clip where she said we need to attack
[2:47:57.080 --> 2:48:01.120]  Russia yes now that's that's dangerous that doesn't matter the point is we're
[2:48:01.120 --> 2:48:05.200]  not saying vote for Barack Obama it doesn't matter and Travis County we
[2:48:05.200 --> 2:48:09.360]  don't have voting it's been proven to be a fraud and this is a I mean that's how
[2:48:09.360 --> 2:48:13.320]  serious these bankers are let's go ahead and talk to Ben in Virginia you're on
[2:48:13.320 --> 2:48:19.360]  the air with our guest George Butler hi Alex how you doing good one of the
[2:48:19.360 --> 2:48:24.800]  protesters in DC that you actually put up on your website on Monday I just wanted
[2:48:24.800 --> 2:48:29.920]  to say that you know this whole bailout bill and everything else is so clear now
[2:48:29.920 --> 2:48:34.560]  and people are so angry while we're down in DC I actually saw a tourist a lady
[2:48:34.560 --> 2:48:38.880]  was just there touring the Capitol screaming at house representatives you
[2:48:38.880 --> 2:48:43.440]  know asking them why are you robbing us why are you doing that doing this to us
[2:48:43.440 --> 2:48:48.480]  and people are so angry right now we just need to find a way to tap into that
[2:48:48.480 --> 2:48:55.240]  well I agree and it shows that the people are finally starting to wake up and
[2:48:55.240 --> 2:48:59.520]  are not I mean again when Congress has a 9% approval writing even before this it
[2:48:59.520 --> 2:49:03.640]  shows that both parties are now hated people realize both parties are in bed
[2:49:03.640 --> 2:49:09.120]  together and they need you know a woman a good-looking woman or they need a you
[2:49:09.120 --> 2:49:13.080]  know handsome articulate black guy to make it look like it's new and different
[2:49:13.080 --> 2:49:17.000]  because it's not an old white guy but but that's it it's it's it's it's it's
[2:49:17.000 --> 2:49:22.680]  skin color and gender is the only difference with these people yeah I
[2:49:22.680 --> 2:49:26.560]  think the more protesters we get out in DC in the next couple of couple of days
[2:49:26.560 --> 2:49:31.640]  it's better because I got on the front page of MSNBC you know I know other
[2:49:31.640 --> 2:49:36.320]  people who have been able to infiltrate the news and basically the more active
[2:49:36.320 --> 2:49:40.040]  you are the more it shows that we don't want this bill it doesn't matter if they
[2:49:40.040 --> 2:49:45.280]  try to cover it up you could tell all your friends everybody will know that's
[2:49:45.280 --> 2:49:52.080]  what it comes out to absolutely anything else very much alright I
[2:49:52.080 --> 2:49:56.520]  appreciate your call I am busy here trying to find the particular clip I
[2:49:56.520 --> 2:50:04.360]  sent John where it sounds just like Miss South Carolina I mean she is just she
[2:50:04.360 --> 2:50:07.640]  is just babbling incoherently well everybody's seen it the clips have been
[2:50:07.640 --> 2:50:12.520]  everywhere I will come back and take some more phone calls before our guests in
[2:50:12.520 --> 2:50:16.440]  fact I want to take the calls we're gonna skip this break to on the internet at
[2:50:16.440 --> 2:50:20.800]  info wars.com on those exclusive screams and on prisonplanet.tv so we can keep
[2:50:20.800 --> 2:50:24.400]  taking your phone calls and get them all in before the shower ends and our next
[2:50:24.400 --> 2:50:31.360]  guest joins us Peter Schiff financial advisor to Ron Paul okay I'm gonna skip
[2:50:31.360 --> 2:50:36.480]  this break let's go ahead here and go back to the calls let's talk to Robert
[2:50:36.480 --> 2:50:40.920]  and California and Rick and Paul go ahead Robert yeah first a little bit of
[2:50:40.920 --> 2:50:47.200]  news I was watching channel four out here in California and they quoted
[2:50:47.200 --> 2:50:53.520]  Barbara Boxer saying that she received over 95,000 calls and 89,000 were
[2:50:53.520 --> 2:50:58.800]  against her voting for a bailout which is about 94% of the people against this
[2:50:58.800 --> 2:51:06.640]  yeah that's what the scientific polls are showing 93 95 Monday and then most
[2:51:06.640 --> 2:51:10.120]  the polls have been about 91% you can there's hundreds of them you can pull
[2:51:10.120 --> 2:51:14.840]  them up but over 90% are against it even with the trillion 200 billion dollar
[2:51:14.840 --> 2:51:18.280]  terrorism when Bush said it'll be a depression and they plunged the market
[2:51:18.280 --> 2:51:23.960]  when Congress said no yeah and let me ask does anybody understand or what is
[2:51:23.960 --> 2:51:29.640]  going on today in the market with a set the downturn of almost everything is
[2:51:29.640 --> 2:51:34.360]  that a is that a reaction to what happened in the foreign markets or is
[2:51:34.360 --> 2:51:40.400]  this just something there they just can't control anymore well look the the we
[2:51:40.400 --> 2:51:47.600]  are a debtor nation and in early 2007 the United States went to its highest
[2:51:47.600 --> 2:51:52.840]  level of private debt ever it's higher than during the Great Depression
[2:51:52.840 --> 2:51:58.040]  that's an official number we have a negative savings it's below zero on
[2:51:58.040 --> 2:52:04.760]  average and so the bankers then the Bilderberg group said now pop the sub
[2:52:04.760 --> 2:52:08.240]  prime begin the the implosion so that's why we know it's a controlled
[2:52:08.240 --> 2:52:12.200]  implosion it's they claim it's so big it could endanger them but they
[2:52:12.200 --> 2:52:18.280]  initiated it and so as soon as they said okay they're now debtors they they
[2:52:18.280 --> 2:52:23.720]  pulled the plug on the credit and so that is what has happened now and you
[2:52:23.720 --> 2:52:28.160]  can slice it anyway you want but the architects of our financial doom are the
[2:52:28.160 --> 2:52:32.920]  ones now reaping the benefits of it and Main Street is coming to a halt the
[2:52:32.920 --> 2:52:37.320]  economy is on the skids even in Austin Texas the supposedly best city in the
[2:52:37.320 --> 2:52:42.200]  country to be in and I mean in places like Michigan and California and other
[2:52:42.200 --> 2:52:48.040]  places it is bad and the value of the currency is only going to make it worse
[2:52:48.040 --> 2:52:54.520]  down the road so but that gives the bankers more power anything else yeah
[2:52:54.520 --> 2:52:58.440]  and the real estate market you know I've reached a recently purchased some
[2:52:58.440 --> 2:53:04.520]  property out in Arizona some undeveloped land that's border and state trust in
[2:53:04.520 --> 2:53:10.000]  mind like danger of them creating a road or anything through there well I don't
[2:53:10.000 --> 2:53:13.120]  know exactly where it's located but they are stealing a lot of land hundreds of
[2:53:13.120 --> 2:53:16.360]  thousands was actually over a million acres in Texas and all over the country
[2:53:16.360 --> 2:53:21.120]  for international highways that are actually international zones and under
[2:53:21.120 --> 2:53:23.920]  international law that are international that that's how the new
[2:53:23.920 --> 2:53:28.440]  order is going to tax one way is carbon taxes the other is international roads
[2:53:28.440 --> 2:53:32.600]  that are internationalized and privatized that then tax the host slave
[2:53:32.600 --> 2:53:35.600]  nations thanks for the call
[2:53:41.120 --> 2:53:47.800]  I did find a bunch of the clips of Sarah Palin sounding like a babbling idiot
[2:53:47.920 --> 2:53:49.960]  you know
[2:53:49.960 --> 2:53:53.560]  yeah I guess that's where yeah
[2:53:53.560 --> 2:53:56.640]  what's going to be why that
[2:53:56.640 --> 2:54:01.520]  enhanced your policy man I tell you that that clip is a completely dirty one on
[2:54:01.520 --> 2:54:04.640]  the air before we leave I don't think we're ever leaving the studio I need to
[2:54:04.640 --> 2:54:08.960]  get the this line fixed here point is I'll find it John I sent you about eight
[2:54:08.960 --> 2:54:14.400]  clips last Saturday of her and I think it's the first clip I sent you is the
[2:54:14.400 --> 2:54:18.200]  one but I guess you didn't save that so let me try to play them here from Texas
[2:54:18.200 --> 2:54:21.880]  if you send them they're saved I'll look at it let me just hear some during the
[2:54:21.880 --> 2:54:24.680]  break I'm now I'm gonna play this I should have played when I first sent to
[2:54:24.680 --> 2:54:27.240]  you and I never got around to because there's so many of them I want to find
[2:54:27.240 --> 2:54:30.760]  a particular one let's go ahead and take another call and George pop in any
[2:54:30.760 --> 2:54:38.240]  time here up next here is licking Texas you're on the air sir
[2:54:38.240 --> 2:54:43.800]  what's the background of John Cornyn I know that they both voted yes Kay Bailey
[2:54:43.800 --> 2:54:48.400]  and I know she was a reporter in Houston but okay do you tell me a little bit about
[2:54:48.400 --> 2:54:52.860]  John Cornyn please well he was a state judge and involved in all sorts of
[2:54:52.860 --> 2:54:58.720]  neo-connery is another fake conservative another stuff shirt puppet for the new
[2:54:58.720 --> 2:55:02.920]  world order I mean most of these people you see are nothing but fishlers I mean
[2:55:02.920 --> 2:55:05.840]  I don't really spend I don't have conversations with purple worms at the
[2:55:05.840 --> 2:55:09.960]  sporting goods store I don't have really conversations with Kay Bailey hushes
[2:55:09.960 --> 2:55:13.680]  under Cornyn I mean if you've got some outside house members that are good
[2:55:13.680 --> 2:55:16.760]  people and aren't controlled like Ron Paul and a few others we interview those
[2:55:16.760 --> 2:55:20.760]  but talking to a Cornyn or they're nothing but bait for the public third
[2:55:20.760 --> 2:55:27.360]  I mean I mean they they run nothing do nothing they're just total puppets they're
[2:55:27.360 --> 2:55:30.720]  I mean they're called cutouts so you want to comment on Cornyn you know we're
[2:55:30.720 --> 2:55:35.240]  right here in Texas George Butler well I believe he does have a some kind of a
[2:55:35.240 --> 2:55:39.360]  Navy background also if I'm if I'm not mistaken I mean I'm in the point it's
[2:55:39.360 --> 2:55:43.000]  just a nothing puppet who runs nothing does nothing and they really hate that
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:45.600]  when you point out they're just nothing but I think he's he's got a strong
[2:55:45.600 --> 2:55:49.720]  tied to clear channel I believe communication also yeah I believe well
[2:55:49.720 --> 2:55:54.000]  what does it and they think they took the UT permanent fund to buy all that up
[2:55:54.000 --> 2:55:57.680]  and then they hand that over again they take everything it's just everything
[2:55:57.680 --> 2:56:01.040]  you know universities are big into football now because that's all they
[2:56:01.040 --> 2:56:04.720]  really do there's not much education not much teaching you know they double
[2:56:04.720 --> 2:56:08.040]  triple tuition their state run is supposed to be free for citizens they
[2:56:08.040 --> 2:56:13.160]  owe you know the oil and gas in Texas take UT and it's it's a cutout it too
[2:56:13.160 --> 2:56:16.920]  as a front and ninety some percent of their actions is owning businesses and
[2:56:16.920 --> 2:56:22.440]  industries and taking your money out of the country anything else I mean why do
[2:56:22.440 --> 2:56:29.360]  you bring up corn and Rick I think they should go to jail yeah but see they run

[2:56:33.600 --> 2:56:36.280]  bunch of brainwashed cops just like the public don't know but don't worry the

[2:56:49.760 --> 2:56:55.160]  the organizers of a micro power station here in Berkeley good job well we play
[2:56:55.160 --> 2:56:59.360]  some of your stuff on the air as well as you know a lot of the folks that you
[2:56:59.360 --> 2:57:06.000]  were and there's one question I have for you and that is I like the idea of
[2:57:06.000 --> 2:57:12.240]  nationalizing the fed but unfortunately that puts the government in
[2:57:12.240 --> 2:57:17.120]  charge of it and I suspect that they would be just as greedy and corrupt as
[2:57:17.120 --> 2:57:20.720]  the people that are running the federal no we need to take it over and point out
[2:57:20.720 --> 2:57:24.880]  it was a criminal organization and put the Fed directors in prison is Ron Paul
[2:57:24.880 --> 2:57:28.120]  the congressman called for on the air here last week people should get that
[2:57:28.120 --> 2:57:31.800]  article and get it out to everybody you know we need to have that idea first in
[2:57:31.800 --> 2:57:36.560]  our minds so we can do that but no we grab it we monetize the debt we arrest
[2:57:36.560 --> 2:57:40.080]  all these people we throw them in prison after a jury of their peers finds them
[2:57:40.080 --> 2:57:43.480]  guilty and then we go hunt down the new world order worldwide and bring them to
[2:57:43.480 --> 2:57:48.680]  justice and then we find you know get rid of 2 million to 3 million cops let
[2:57:48.680 --> 2:57:52.520]  them go get real jobs again and we should we decriminalize drugs let the
[2:57:52.520 --> 2:57:56.240]  non-violent people out of prisons we start arresting real criminals and if
[2:57:56.240 --> 2:57:59.000]  your car gets broken into your house gets robbed the cops are gonna do what
[2:57:59.000 --> 2:58:02.200]  they used to do put their nose to the ground and go off and do police work and
[2:58:02.200 --> 2:58:05.920]  they can go back to getting pine coffee and being loved instead of hated but

[2:59:40.040 --> 2:59:42.760]  want to have back in the near future I think I'm gonna have you and Bob Desi

[3:00:00.000 --> 3:00:05.000]  be great but so we're in here running George through his paces he's got a
[3:00:05.000 --> 3:00:10.960]  show Saturday nights on Genesis find out at GCNLive.com we've got one of Ron
[3:00:10.960 --> 3:00:15.200]  Paul's chief advisors coming on Peter Schiff here in just a few minutes but
[3:00:15.200 --> 3:00:21.960]  right now let's go ahead and talk to Scott and Anthony and a few others Scott
[3:00:21.960 --> 3:00:25.280]  and Arizona you're on the air with George Butler and Alejandro Jones
[3:00:25.280 --> 3:00:33.000]  Hey Alex my question is we know that Rockefeller seems like we is there a way
[3:00:33.000 --> 3:00:37.560]  to put him like you've done movies on on these guys yeah David Rockefeller just
[3:00:37.560 --> 3:00:41.600]  called for one child policy and population reduction again today that's up
[3:00:41.600 --> 3:00:47.400]  on PrisonPlanet.com how can we can't go and just put I mean major like like
[3:00:47.400 --> 3:00:51.760]  crimes against humanity on this guy just put him all over the press because they
[3:00:51.760 --> 3:00:56.760]  own most of the of the counties and cities and the grand juries and the CIA
[3:00:56.760 --> 3:01:01.000]  has run most major cities for 20 years I mean literally I mean they pay people
[3:01:01.000 --> 3:01:05.640]  off and satchels of money kill mayors police chiefs I mean we the US military
[3:01:05.640 --> 3:01:10.400]  runs America and now Northcom publicly does it and you get a Jim Garrison
[3:01:10.400 --> 3:01:13.520]  every once in a while and they went after him and threatened his children but
[3:01:13.520 --> 3:01:17.040]  as the evil unfolds more and more people in government who haven't been bought off
[3:01:17.040 --> 3:01:21.560]  will stand up but they've corrupted so many you know most sheriffs are now
[3:01:21.560 --> 3:01:27.200]  former FBI or CIA you know run by the feds and put in power and so and so yes
[3:01:27.200 --> 3:01:31.760]  we need grand juries to indict Bernanke Paulson I mean they've committed
[3:01:31.760 --> 3:01:35.600]  crimes publicly as Ron Paul said on air last week we need to we you know we need
[3:01:35.600 --> 3:01:41.760]  to bring him to justice but I mean I mean look PDDs the State Department of
[3:01:41.760 --> 3:01:46.520]  Random 200 where it's you know openly calls for genocide that's US law I mean
[3:01:46.520 --> 3:01:49.880]  that's US policy Kissinger should be arrested right now in fact he's
[3:01:49.880 --> 3:01:54.360]  he's indicted all over the world I'm like I mean this is the one we just need to
[3:01:54.360 --> 3:01:57.880]  focus on the these two names of the big players they all work for him Bernanke
[3:01:57.880 --> 3:02:02.200]  and all of them work for Rockefeller we need to really focus on him and and
[3:02:02.200 --> 3:02:05.880]  Henry Kissinger just really work on those two guys right there if we could
[3:02:05.880 --> 3:02:09.880]  just focus on two individuals to try to bring him down and let the whole world
[3:02:09.880 --> 3:02:13.360]  come well I mean it would be good to bring them down but remember it's like
[3:02:13.360 --> 3:02:17.400]  shark teeth that you know that they've got all their evil underlings under them
[3:02:17.400 --> 3:02:20.720]  and it's a system that it is credit the private Federal Reserve system I
[3:02:20.720 --> 3:02:24.440]  appreciate your call Scott Anthony in New Jersey last caller here on the air go
[3:02:24.440 --> 3:02:29.400]  ahead Alex I'm I was just curious if you're familiar with some of the policies
[3:02:29.400 --> 3:02:33.880]  and rhetoric of Linda LaRouche yes I don't agree I agree with his analysis
[3:02:33.880 --> 3:02:37.440]  about the Anglo-American banking establishment what about some of his
[3:02:37.440 --> 3:02:42.160]  ideas about returning to FDR policy FDR's policies well we've had Tarpley who
[3:02:42.160 --> 3:02:47.720]  was formerly one of his acolytes on who kind of espouses the same model and
[3:02:47.720 --> 3:02:55.880]  that is a better model than the corporate kleptocracy that is not free
[3:02:55.880 --> 3:03:00.520]  capitalism free market that we have now and I mean instead of bailing out the
[3:03:00.520 --> 3:03:04.320]  bankers I agree I mean if they really just gave each American so there wasn't
[3:03:04.320 --> 3:03:08.360]  any bureaucracy fifty thousand dollars basically what that would be their
[3:03:08.360 --> 3:03:11.680]  piece of this bailout that would actually get the economy going you're
[3:03:11.680 --> 3:03:14.400]  still gonna devalue the currency but people could you know that would you
[3:03:14.400 --> 3:03:17.560]  know that would help a little bit but but but if they're gonna go ahead and
[3:03:17.560 --> 3:03:21.720]  devalue it to begin with George yeah Linda LaRouche is is quite an
[3:03:21.720 --> 3:03:27.280]  interesting character in his world view he's mixed neo-platinism in with
[3:03:27.280 --> 3:03:32.600]  Alexander Hamilton and a very strong collectivist socialist view that that
[3:03:32.600 --> 3:03:36.840]  I can't subscribe to that's basically now that's right he I mean he's right
[3:03:36.840 --> 3:03:40.440]  about the problems but then his solution is not correct we'll be talking to
[3:03:40.440 --> 3:03:46.560]  somebody who who I do agree with Peter Schiff coming up in the next segment
[3:03:46.560 --> 3:03:51.360]  okay he's still a statist Linda LaRouche is he's for big government which the
[3:03:51.360 --> 3:03:55.440]  bankers want it yes that's right he knows the money problem but he's wanting
[3:03:55.440 --> 3:03:58.400]  to cure it with the big government yeah he's saying the problem is we've got
[3:03:58.400 --> 3:04:03.000]  corrupt people in charge of the lock me in charge and I'll it's gonna be okay
[3:04:03.000 --> 3:04:06.680]  well also that's what he said the LaRouche and organization itself I'll
[3:04:06.680 --> 3:04:11.840]  just say it's very pushy and well just if you've ever had an experience with
[3:04:11.840 --> 3:04:15.360]  them folks you know I've studied them for about three years you know my grandma
[3:04:15.360 --> 3:04:22.960]  can't say anything nice still say hey George thanks for coming in okay thank
[3:04:22.960 --> 3:04:28.760]  you you bet I'd we have shift only they got me on hold fantastic
[3:04:28.960 --> 3:04:33.840]  more than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know
[3:04:33.840 --> 3:04:37.520]  that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than

[3:08:39.120 --> 3:08:43.440]  people that Congressman Ron Paul sites he's involved with the Ludwig von Mies
[3:08:43.440 --> 3:08:48.360]  Institute as well and he appears a frequent guest on CNBC Fox News Bloomberg
[3:08:48.360 --> 3:08:52.800]  television right for some of the biggest newspapers in the US and worldwide and
[3:08:52.800 --> 3:08:57.240]  we'll also be giving you his website he has several of them so he can plug
[3:08:57.240 --> 3:09:01.600]  whatever he likes here on the air today with us for the next 50 minutes and if
[3:09:01.600 --> 3:09:05.240]  we have time we'll take some phone calls for him before he leaves Mr. Schiff it
[3:09:05.240 --> 3:09:07.360]  is a really great honor to have you on with us
[3:09:07.360 --> 3:09:13.240]  oh nice to be here okay let's get into what's happening with the current
[3:09:13.240 --> 3:09:16.920]  global financial system where you see it going in the short and long term the
[3:09:16.920 --> 3:09:21.280]  bailout but then I want to look at the different ways of dealing with this
[3:09:21.280 --> 3:09:24.600]  crisis from the position of the central bankers which I don't want to call
[3:09:24.600 --> 3:09:28.480]  free market they're blaming the free market and in the system right now in
[3:09:28.480 --> 3:09:32.040]  the media versus what a true free market would have done
[3:09:32.040 --> 3:09:36.280]  yeah well first of all the global financial system is in fact melting down
[3:09:36.280 --> 3:09:41.680]  because it's been unsustainable the premise has been that the rest of the
[3:09:41.680 --> 3:09:46.520]  world saves their money and they loan it to Americans who spend it all and
[3:09:46.520 --> 3:09:50.400]  promise to pay it back but the problem is you know when you borrow money and
[3:09:50.400 --> 3:09:54.000]  spend it you don't have any way of paying it back you know the only way
[3:09:54.000 --> 3:09:58.440]  Americans can pay back the money we've borrowed is to stop spending and the
[3:09:58.440 --> 3:10:02.000]  rest and therefore use the money that we would have spent on consumption to
[3:10:02.000 --> 3:10:07.160]  pay back our debts but we can't do that because our whole economy is a function
[3:10:07.160 --> 3:10:11.040]  of us spending money so in order to keep our phony economy going we have to keep
[3:10:11.040 --> 3:10:14.840]  spending which means we can't pay back any of our debts but in order to keep
[3:10:14.840 --> 3:10:18.560]  spending we have to borrow more which means the rest of the world has to loan
[3:10:18.560 --> 3:10:22.920]  us money indefinitely without any hope of ever getting paid back and I think
[3:10:22.920 --> 3:10:27.800]  this whole dynamic is finally falling apart because the world never
[3:10:27.800 --> 3:10:31.280]  operated under the assumption that they were giving us money they actually
[3:10:31.280 --> 3:10:35.120]  believe that they were lending us money even though we lack the capacity to pay
[3:10:35.120 --> 3:10:39.440]  it back and now as all these loans are going bad it the whole financial system
[3:10:39.440 --> 3:10:46.680]  is crumbling please continue you know going through the fundamentals for folks
[3:10:46.680 --> 3:10:50.400]  and then placing the blame where it needs to go because instead they're
[3:10:50.400 --> 3:10:53.720]  blaming it on the American people they're blaming it on well I mean the
[3:10:53.720 --> 3:10:59.200]  American people simply you know acted on the incentives that being delivered to
[3:10:59.200 --> 3:11:02.280]  them by the government through our monetary policy and to our through our
[3:11:02.280 --> 3:11:06.800]  fiscal policy I mean number one we kept interest rates much too low in this
[3:11:06.800 --> 3:11:11.080]  country particularly in the aftermath of September 11th and the bursting of the
[3:11:11.080 --> 3:11:14.920]  Nasdaq bubble when the Fed had interest rates down at one percent they were
[3:11:14.920 --> 3:11:20.000]  literally giving money away and you know when money is free people take it and
[3:11:20.000 --> 3:11:23.840]  and people took that cheap money and gambled with it principally on real
[3:11:23.840 --> 3:11:28.760]  state not only were American gambling themselves by buying real state at
[3:11:28.760 --> 3:11:33.680]  prices that were absurd but wall street was financing the whole thing they were
[3:11:33.680 --> 3:11:37.800]  taking the cheap money and and and and underwriting everybody speculation the
[3:11:37.800 --> 3:11:41.600]  housing market so we have this gigantic housing bubble and of course the
[3:11:41.600 --> 3:11:45.000]  housing bubble made everybody think that they were rich and so as people were
[3:11:45.000 --> 3:11:49.880]  extracting equity from their homes and buying cars and SUVs and cell phones and
[3:11:49.880 --> 3:11:54.040]  plasma TVs they didn't really think they were borrowing the money they actually
[3:11:54.040 --> 3:11:57.000]  thought they were rich they thought they had all this home equity that they were
[3:11:57.000 --> 3:12:01.480]  tapping into but the reality was the home equity never really existed all they
[3:12:01.480 --> 3:12:05.960]  were doing was borrowing money you know secured by you know the illusion of
[3:12:05.960 --> 3:12:10.960]  home equity that secured by inflation well it was you know the inflation is
[3:12:10.960 --> 3:12:14.560]  what was putting the money into circulation you know and eventually the
[3:12:14.560 --> 3:12:18.800]  inflation started to cause prices to rise other than real estate such as food
[3:12:18.800 --> 3:12:22.520]  such as energy and of course the government blamed that on external
[3:12:22.520 --> 3:12:26.320]  factors but of course it was a direct result of their monetary policy you
[3:12:26.320 --> 3:12:30.560]  know but then we also have a tax code that incentivizes borrowing we give
[3:12:30.560 --> 3:12:35.080]  people deductions for their mortgage interest yet we tax people if they
[3:12:35.080 --> 3:12:39.480]  earn any interest and you know we had all kinds of incentives to buy and flip
[3:12:39.480 --> 3:12:43.720]  houses with tax breaks if you buy a house and sell it a profit you pay no
[3:12:43.720 --> 3:12:48.240]  taxes but if you buy another asset to sell it a profit you pay taxes and if
[3:12:48.240 --> 3:12:52.400]  you actually work for living and earn wages you pay a lot of taxes so the
[3:12:52.400 --> 3:12:56.320]  government made it more lucrative to flip property than have a job and they
[3:12:56.320 --> 3:13:00.400]  provided the cheap money they also provided the market with Freddie and
[3:13:00.400 --> 3:13:04.680]  Fannie which are these giant government-sponsored enterprises which
[3:13:04.680 --> 3:13:10.040]  by by guaranteeing all the mortgages made it possible for people to borrow much
[3:13:10.040 --> 3:13:14.880]  more money than they can repay because the lenders didn't care about the default
[3:13:14.880 --> 3:13:17.960]  risk because the government was guaranteeing the mortgages so you had
[3:13:17.960 --> 3:13:21.840]  that moral hazard as they had this huge bubble but the whole thing is blown
[3:13:21.840 --> 3:13:25.440]  apart but it's not about the other areas I mean we have the mortgages but we also
[3:13:25.440 --> 3:13:30.240]  have all the other types of derivatives and then and then the insuring of the
[3:13:30.240 --> 3:13:34.160]  model is the bottom line with all these derivatives is the underlying assets are
[3:13:34.160 --> 3:13:38.680]  liabilities that nobody can pay whether they're mortgage debt or credit card
[3:13:38.680 --> 3:13:43.600]  debt or student loans or automobile automobile loans basically the one thing
[3:13:43.600 --> 3:13:47.400]  that we were creating in this country was liabilities and then Wall Street would
[3:13:47.400 --> 3:13:51.080]  package these liabilities and make all sorts of securities out of them and so
[3:13:51.080 --> 3:13:55.400]  our whole economy was about incurring debt and securitizing and restructuring
[3:13:55.400 --> 3:14:00.080]  debt it was all it was all a facade and of course but all this paper wealth
[3:14:00.080 --> 3:14:03.680]  enabled us to spend a lot of money but the money we were spending was being
[3:14:03.680 --> 3:14:07.760]  loaned to us by the Chinese by the Japanese by the Saudis and all of the
[3:14:07.760 --> 3:14:11.600]  things that we were spending the money on were being produced in China and
[3:14:11.600 --> 3:14:15.640]  Japan and other parts of the world so we were basically living off the charity
[3:14:15.640 --> 3:14:19.480]  and the productivity of the rest of the world and it was destined to end because
[3:14:19.480 --> 3:14:26.720]  there's a world block that support us forever break down where we're going
[3:14:26.720 --> 3:14:31.880]  but I mean either way I mean the bailout to me is not so much about the 800
[3:14:31.880 --> 3:14:35.400]  something billion up to five trillion depending on how you look at it that it
[3:14:35.400 --> 3:14:40.520]  is about giving new powers to the Treasury giving them immunity and now we
[3:14:40.520 --> 3:14:43.960]  see all these different I mean there's no there's no real bailout because the
[3:14:43.960 --> 3:14:46.840]  government can't bail anybody out because the government is broke I mean
[3:14:46.840 --> 3:14:50.560]  they're just going to borrow more money from abroad or print more money and
[3:14:50.560 --> 3:14:54.800]  ultimately it's a power grab by the US government to take a more control of
[3:14:54.800 --> 3:14:58.120]  our economy and you know they're not going to it's not going to make the
[3:14:58.120 --> 3:15:01.680]  stock market go up it's not going to make a real estate market go up I mean it's
[3:15:01.680 --> 3:15:05.280]  not going to make all these bad loans disappear it's just going to make the
[3:15:05.280 --> 3:15:10.600]  bad loans the losses for those bad loans felt more intently by average
[3:15:10.600 --> 3:15:15.000]  Americans than would otherwise be the case if the losses were were left on the
[3:15:15.000 --> 3:15:21.040]  books of the banks and the end Wall Street so so where is all this going I
[3:15:21.040 --> 3:15:25.280]  mean I mean one way or another how is this going to unfold it's going to be
[3:15:25.280 --> 3:15:29.040]  a disaster I mean you know we're going to have something like the Great
[3:15:29.040 --> 3:15:34.320]  Depression only maybe worse because this time it'll be an inflationary
[3:15:34.320 --> 3:15:39.280]  depression where instead of consumer prices going down they actually rise
[3:15:39.280 --> 3:15:43.920]  substantially and that is what we're looking at and you know the reason we're
[3:15:43.920 --> 3:15:47.960]  going to have a depression is not because of a failure of the market I mean
[3:15:47.960 --> 3:15:51.480]  that's not why we have a depression in the 30s we're going to take the government
[3:15:51.480 --> 3:15:55.400]  will create a depression because they refuse to allow the market to function
[3:15:55.400 --> 3:16:00.040]  you know they have to refuse to allow the free market to work out all these
[3:16:00.040 --> 3:16:04.200]  malinvestments and purge purge all the excesses from the economy because the
[3:16:04.200 --> 3:16:08.840]  politicians don't want to level with the American public and tell them that
[3:16:08.840 --> 3:16:12.040]  times are going to get tough and that there's nothing the government can do
[3:16:12.040 --> 3:16:16.760]  about it that this is just the price we have to pay for years of reckless
[3:16:16.760 --> 3:16:20.840]  borrowing and spending all the years we lived above our means now we're going to
[3:16:20.840 --> 3:16:23.760]  have to live below them and they don't want it they don't want to deliver that
[3:16:23.760 --> 3:16:27.720]  message and so they pretend they want to pretend that oh there's a big problem
[3:16:27.720 --> 3:16:31.040]  and we as the government are going to say that you we're going to we're going to
[3:16:31.040 --> 3:16:34.240]  protect you we're going to you know we're going to give you something and
[3:16:34.240 --> 3:16:37.520]  that's what's going to create the depression it's going to be all the
[3:16:37.520 --> 3:16:41.840]  interference in the market that is going to lead to widespread unemployment
[3:16:41.840 --> 3:16:47.000]  massive inflation because of decades ago and then throughout financial history
[3:16:47.000 --> 3:16:51.400]  not just here but in Asia and in the 90s as you know but like to speak to this
[3:16:51.400 --> 3:16:57.440]  governments do come in and reward the criminals that are in engaging in this
[3:16:57.440 --> 3:17:00.680]  generally from the government level between corporations and the government
[3:17:00.680 --> 3:17:05.080]  in collusion which is crony capitalism it's not free market and so that allowed
[3:17:05.080 --> 3:17:10.240]  them to in be involved in even bigger frauds now the government's going to
[3:17:10.240 --> 3:17:14.200]  blame the free market bring in some type of global socialist regulatory
[3:17:14.200 --> 3:17:18.160]  banking system that's what they're doing right now I mean governments love a
[3:17:18.160 --> 3:17:22.600]  crisis even especially if it's a crisis of their own creation because what
[3:17:22.600 --> 3:17:27.120]  happens is they affect the free market with their socialist programs and then
[3:17:27.120 --> 3:17:31.840]  when it has a deleterious effect then the government can ride to the rescue
[3:17:31.840 --> 3:17:36.080]  saying aha we told you capitalism doesn't work you need us to save you
[3:17:36.080 --> 3:17:41.640]  and the public is so scared of that they and they trust the government and the
[3:17:41.640 --> 3:17:45.240]  government grabs even more power and now they use that power to do even more
[3:17:45.240 --> 3:17:49.440]  damage and now they say aha you need us even more and they continue to use the
[3:17:49.440 --> 3:17:54.400]  crisis in the bad economic times to grab additional power in fact if you look
[3:17:54.400 --> 3:17:58.000]  at all the death spots in history and you look at you know where they came and
[3:17:58.000 --> 3:18:01.200]  we look at like an out of Hitler I mean how did he was how was he able to come
[3:18:01.200 --> 3:18:05.400]  to power he was able to come to power amid the chaos of the hyperinflation
[3:18:05.400 --> 3:18:10.280]  that rabbit is why my republic and if I wasn't for that type of environment
[3:18:10.280 --> 3:18:15.320]  that the the germans never would have given up that kind of power to tell
[3:18:15.320 --> 3:18:21.320]  the golly-hiller well let's look at the United States the private banks you
[3:18:21.320 --> 3:18:24.760]  know should have gone out of business some of them that ran scams and and then
[3:18:24.760 --> 3:18:31.760]  and caused panics leading up to 1913 then the banks write it as an anti-banking
[3:18:31.760 --> 3:18:35.920]  bill for government regulation government giving governmental type power to
[3:18:35.920 --> 3:18:40.360]  private banks then they engineer the 29 crash and now the same group is bringing
[3:18:40.360 --> 3:18:45.080]  us into the same situation now and the public doesn't understand that it was
[3:18:45.080 --> 3:18:52.080]  government colluding with these private crimes and the kids that caused us to
[3:18:52.080 --> 3:18:56.360]  begin with yeah and you know and the government is trying to pretend that we
[3:18:56.360 --> 3:19:00.560]  know we have to pop up these banks so that we can keep on borrowing money to
[3:19:00.560 --> 3:19:04.720]  buy things but you know we can stop borrowing money to buy things exactly
[3:19:04.720 --> 3:19:08.120]  they're acting like the economy they're saying there won't be payroll met the
[3:19:08.120 --> 3:19:12.440]  whole economy will shut down if we don't have these guys to lend so I don't run
[3:19:12.440 --> 3:19:17.960]  my little business in debt I don't run ridiculous I hear I hear the
[3:19:17.960 --> 3:19:22.200]  politicians say stuff like if we if these banks fail then you won't be able to
[3:19:22.200 --> 3:19:26.400]  borrow any money to send your kids to college well you know what that's
[3:19:26.400 --> 3:19:30.200]  actually a good thing it doesn't mean that kids won't be able to go to college
[3:19:30.200 --> 3:19:34.000]  once the universities realize that nobody can borrow any money to pay
[3:19:34.000 --> 3:19:38.200]  tuition you know what they're gonna do they're gonna flash their tuition they're
[3:19:38.200 --> 3:19:41.000]  gonna they're gonna look over their bureaucracies they're gonna figure out
[3:19:41.000 --> 3:19:44.840]  where can we cut back who can we fire because we don't want to go more than
[3:19:44.840 --> 3:19:48.800]  that the University of Texas that 90 plus percent of its operations is just
[3:19:48.800 --> 3:19:51.960]  investments that have nothing to do with the University they're going to stop
[3:19:51.960 --> 3:19:55.800]  ripping the people off and then putting it their own private crony side

[3:24:32.480 --> 3:24:37.680]  the ones now that are gonna be listened to it's gonna be the very people the
[3:24:37.680 --> 3:24:44.840]  very people that carried carried all of this out so what do you see them doing
[3:24:44.840 --> 3:24:47.440]  and I mean breaking it down what is it going to look like I'm just gonna be a
[3:24:47.440 --> 3:24:52.040]  full-bore depression I've probably something worse if we don't change you
[3:24:52.040 --> 3:24:55.520]  know when I wrote my book crash proof I had a profit from the comic economic
[3:24:55.520 --> 3:25:01.440]  collapse which came out in February of 2007 you know interestingly even almost
[3:25:01.440 --> 3:25:04.600]  two years after it's come out it's right now the number one selling
[3:25:04.600 --> 3:25:07.880]  investment book on Amazon and they just I think they just reprinted another
[3:25:07.880 --> 3:25:12.080]  35,000 copies which they tell me is unprecedented for a book that's almost
[3:25:12.080 --> 3:25:15.480]  two years old so people are certainly reading it but when I wrote that book
[3:25:15.480 --> 3:25:20.280]  originally one of my forecasts was this economy would collapse this phony
[3:25:20.280 --> 3:25:24.080]  borrow and spend economy the housing bubble I predicted that all that would
[3:25:24.080 --> 3:25:28.320]  happen that we'd have major fallout and ramifications in the financial industry
[3:25:28.320 --> 3:25:33.320]  and among the lenders based on all these mortgages gone bad but I also made it
[3:25:33.320 --> 3:25:37.600]  a more dire forecast which was predicated on what I thought the
[3:25:37.600 --> 3:25:42.600]  government would likely do in response to the crash to try to prevent it from
[3:25:42.600 --> 3:25:47.920]  happening to try to artificially reflate real estate prices and it's those
[3:25:47.920 --> 3:25:52.920]  government actions that I feared would lead to the worst-case scenario of a
[3:25:52.920 --> 3:25:57.880]  hyperinflation and you know of a real disastrous outcome for economy and now
[3:25:57.880 --> 3:26:01.560]  that is exactly what is happening the government is doing exactly what I feared
[3:26:01.560 --> 3:26:06.040]  they would do and yeah you know it does frustrate me that you know for years I
[3:26:06.040 --> 3:26:10.240]  was going on television and I'm certainly writing and doing things and
[3:26:10.240 --> 3:26:14.320]  pointing out all these problems and while I was doing it all the supposed
[3:26:14.320 --> 3:26:18.200]  experts in government in Wall Street night debated you know many of them on
[3:26:18.200 --> 3:26:21.800]  television are they all laughed at me and they you know looked at me they
[3:26:21.800 --> 3:26:26.040]  stickered or they this is impossible this guy is not he's a he's just a gloom
[3:26:26.040 --> 3:26:29.320]  and doom he's a perma bear I mean this is just he's just a fear mongering
[3:26:29.320 --> 3:26:34.200]  none of this could possibly happen it's impossible and of course all of the
[3:26:34.200 --> 3:26:38.960]  economic predictions have come true I get the very people who said that it was
[3:26:38.960 --> 3:26:43.280]  impossible the people who assured us that our economy was in great shape that
[3:26:43.280 --> 3:26:46.520]  we were fundamentally found that it was the best economy in the history of the
[3:26:46.520 --> 3:26:50.400]  world that Alan Green was the greatest central banker who ever lived you know
[3:26:50.400 --> 3:26:53.600]  that everything was perfect these are the guys that they're turning to for
[3:26:53.600 --> 3:26:58.240]  solutions these are the same people who say we need to pass this bailout bill
[3:26:58.240 --> 3:27:05.400]  or it's the end of the world what are you doing with your money well I mean
[3:27:05.400 --> 3:27:08.560]  I'm doing the same thing with my money as I've been recommending that everybody
[3:27:08.560 --> 3:27:11.640]  do their money for years that get out of the US dollar I mean you know I know
[3:27:11.640 --> 3:27:16.400]  that everybody is talking about how is this bailout bill gonna affect taxpayers
[3:27:16.400 --> 3:27:21.560]  well it's not gonna affect us so much as taxpayers because nobody is raising our
[3:27:21.560 --> 3:27:26.120]  taxes in fact in this most recent bailout bill the Senate approved an
[3:27:26.120 --> 3:27:31.880]  additional $100 billion in tax cuts so you know not only are they spending
[3:27:31.880 --> 3:27:36.440]  $700 billion and not paying for it but they're cutting taxes by an extra
[3:27:36.440 --> 3:27:40.840]  hundred billion so it's not taxpayers who are gonna suffer or not Americans
[3:27:40.840 --> 3:27:45.480]  with their taxpayer hat how we're gonna suffer if through the erosion of the
[3:27:45.480 --> 3:27:51.440]  value of our wages and our investments our savings the bonds that we own the
[3:27:51.440 --> 3:27:55.440]  insurance that we own because it's all gonna be paid for with inflation the
[3:27:55.440 --> 3:27:58.680]  government is printing money and spending it into circulation and it's gonna
[3:27:58.680 --> 3:28:02.240]  debase the value of everybody's savings and everybody's wages and it's not just
[3:28:02.240 --> 3:28:05.480]  gonna be this seven or eight hundred billion because of the perverse moral
[3:28:05.480 --> 3:28:09.880]  hazards that are built in this bailout bill the result of the bailout bill is
[3:28:09.880 --> 3:28:13.760]  going to be a wave of delinquencies on their mortgages because what's gonna
[3:28:13.760 --> 3:28:17.520]  happen now is that when somebody stops making their mortgage payment there's
[3:28:17.520 --> 3:28:21.320]  not gonna be a foreclosure what's gonna happen is the bank is simply gonna sell
[3:28:21.320 --> 3:28:25.440]  that asset to the government rather than foreclose it because they'll get more
[3:28:25.440 --> 3:28:28.560]  money selling it to the government so if you if you stop making your mortgage
[3:28:28.560 --> 3:28:31.640]  payment once this bill is passed no one's gonna kick you out of your house
[3:28:31.640 --> 3:28:34.880]  you'll probably live there for a year or two and eventually you'll get a call
[3:28:34.880 --> 3:28:38.360]  from the government saying hey we own your mortgage now I know it's five
[3:28:38.360 --> 3:28:41.240]  hundred thousand dollars and I notice you're not paying it how about if we
[3:28:41.240 --> 3:28:44.620]  reduce it to two hundred thousand dollars and give you a 30-year mortgage at
[3:28:44.620 --> 3:28:49.080]  4% would you consider making the payments and then you might say sure so
[3:28:49.080 --> 3:28:52.520]  what's gonna happen is this is gonna this is gonna turn into a you know an
[3:28:52.520 --> 3:28:57.440]  all-out you know frenzy of people stopping paying their mortgages which
[3:28:57.440 --> 3:29:00.800]  means this is probably gonna cost two or three trillion dollars but I mean we're
[3:29:00.800 --> 3:29:04.680]  all looking at we're all looking at the at the mortgages the credit cards are
[3:29:04.680 --> 3:29:08.400]  coming to well I was gonna make those payments I mean if the government's
[3:29:08.400 --> 3:29:11.400]  gonna bail you out of your mortgage debt don't tell you about your credit card
[3:29:11.400 --> 3:29:15.000]  debt to but again how they're gonna bail it out is issuing more liquidity that
[3:29:15.000 --> 3:29:18.280]  devalues the dollar and who does that punish the people that actually did
[3:29:18.280 --> 3:29:23.360]  save the individuals that actually suckers and therefore we can't have an
[3:29:23.360 --> 3:29:27.160]  economy you see the only way you can have a capitalist economy a real economy
[3:29:27.160 --> 3:29:32.520]  is to have savings savings are the root of all we now have a negative savings
[3:29:32.520 --> 3:29:36.280]  rate lower than the depth of the Great Depression stay there petership only
[3:29:36.280 --> 3:29:40.320]  come back and get your take on then where this is going how this is gonna
[3:29:40.320 --> 3:29:45.080]  unfold and also tell folks about your book that predicted all of this stay

[3:30:11.960 --> 3:30:16.400]  the enemy in London this is his ammo we have to look to the Middle East we have

[3:30:28.720 --> 3:30:34.640]  engaged in spying in and on the US I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have
[3:30:34.640 --> 3:30:39.320]  been detained in London's connections to the CIA the hijackers ties to the FBI

[3:33:32.560 --> 3:33:37.640]  market versus this thing we've got where select bankers and corporations don't
[3:33:37.640 --> 3:33:42.320]  play by any rules they can cheat and steal the public this relationship with
[3:33:42.320 --> 3:33:46.200]  government where they suck the wealth of the people out and then they call that
[3:33:46.200 --> 3:33:51.160]  capitalism when really it's beginning to look like communism or socialism for
[3:33:51.160 --> 3:33:55.080]  the rich and slavery for us and we're gonna take a few calls for our guests
[3:33:55.080 --> 3:33:58.640]  specifically on economics and the bailout here's the toll-free number I'm
[3:33:58.640 --> 3:34:02.160]  opening the phones back up he's gonna be gone in 15 minutes or 18 minutes to be
[3:34:02.160 --> 3:34:10.600]  technical 1-800-259-9231 800 259-9231 to get upon the air with our guest best
[3:34:10.600 --> 3:34:16.800]  selling author multiple times EuroPak.net but I wanted to talk to you about
[3:34:16.800 --> 3:34:21.960]  the window of opportunity we've got because I was pleasantly surprised when
[3:34:21.960 --> 3:34:26.920]  the Congress the house said no Monday because they were getting 2,000 calls
[3:34:26.920 --> 3:34:30.440]  to five I talked to multiple congressmen on air was about that they get
[3:34:30.440 --> 3:34:34.600]  thousands of calls for a couple of pro calls other senators are saying the same
[3:34:34.600 --> 3:34:38.600]  thing not just house members so they did the right thing narrowly defeated it by
[3:34:38.600 --> 3:34:43.440]  25 votes or so now the Senate passes it they're trying to get the house to pass
[3:34:43.440 --> 3:34:49.520]  it now and all this immunity and new powers you said to the Feds how do we
[3:34:49.520 --> 3:34:53.800]  maximize like you said your book two years in print number one on Amazon
[3:34:53.800 --> 3:34:58.240]  right now in the financials you know everything I've talked about our numbers
[3:34:58.240 --> 3:35:02.360]  exploding Ron Paul's credibility exploding you know all of us that were
[3:35:02.360 --> 3:35:06.160]  right not that we're geniuses we're just studying real history and what the
[3:35:06.160 --> 3:35:10.680]  financial leader doing how do we maximize this window of opportunity to
[3:35:10.680 --> 3:35:15.280]  hopefully turn this around before as you've said you know you predicted this
[3:35:15.280 --> 3:35:18.520]  and then you give a worst-case scenario and they're following the worst-case
[3:35:18.520 --> 3:35:23.800]  scenario we can turn it around you know that the Congress is probably going to
[3:35:23.800 --> 3:35:27.320]  pass this thing you know they scared the public now with this big drop in the
[3:35:27.320 --> 3:35:30.560]  market they're blaming it on the fact that the bill didn't pass and they're
[3:35:30.560 --> 3:35:34.560]  saying look just pass this bill and we'll make your stocks go back up it's not
[3:35:34.560 --> 3:35:37.960]  going to work I mean the market is going to go down whether they pass it or not
[3:35:37.960 --> 3:35:41.440]  ultimately it's going to go down more if they pass it than if they don't because
[3:35:41.440 --> 3:35:45.160]  again this is going to do a lot of damage and see a lot of power to the
[3:35:45.160 --> 3:35:49.720]  government and make the markets a lot less free and therefore less
[3:35:49.720 --> 3:35:54.400]  efficient but unfortunately there's nothing we can do as Americans you know
[3:35:54.400 --> 3:35:58.520]  we can protest all we want but we're not going to change what government is
[3:35:58.520 --> 3:36:02.800]  doing so all we can do unfortunately is protect our own wealth and our own
[3:36:02.800 --> 3:36:07.520]  families by taking our financial destiny in our own hands and that was part of
[3:36:07.520 --> 3:36:11.440]  the premise of my book crash proof and my new book I have a book that just came
[3:36:11.440 --> 3:36:15.720]  out this week called a little book of bull moves and bear markets and it's
[3:36:15.720 --> 3:36:20.240]  designed to not only show you that this crisis is inevitable but you know where
[3:36:20.240 --> 3:36:23.680]  you can invest your money so that you don't end up broke like everybody else
[3:36:23.680 --> 3:36:26.680]  because unfortunately if they wiped out the value of the dollar they're going to
[3:36:26.680 --> 3:36:31.120]  wipe out all US dollar financial assets and with that any retirement dreams that
[3:36:31.120 --> 3:36:34.960]  any Americans might be harboring right now if they if they have dollars and I
[3:36:34.960 --> 3:36:38.760]  don't care how rich you are you can be a multi-millionaire you might even be a
[3:36:38.760 --> 3:36:42.200]  billionaire if your money's in dollars you're going to be broke so you've got
[3:36:42.200 --> 3:36:44.840]  to look around you got to look at foreign markets foreign currencies
[3:36:44.840 --> 3:36:49.640]  precious metals other types of investments and you know it's very
[3:36:49.640 --> 3:36:54.320]  ironic that right now you're actually seeing the dollar strengthened
[3:36:54.320 --> 3:36:59.160]  substantially based on the profits of this bailout because the world's investors
[3:36:59.160 --> 3:37:03.240]  are so stupid that they actually think the bailout's going to work they actually
[3:37:03.240 --> 3:37:06.840]  think this thing is going to solve all our economic problems it shows you how
[3:37:06.840 --> 3:37:09.960]  little people learn I mean of course these are the same investors who brought
[3:37:09.960 --> 3:37:12.800]  all those subprime mortgages in the first place and thought they were so
[3:37:12.800 --> 3:37:17.160]  great and who bought all the dot-com stocks in 1999 and 2000 so they have a
[3:37:17.160 --> 3:37:20.920]  lousy track record yet they determine the short-term movements in the markets
[3:37:20.920 --> 3:37:24.240]  because they control everybody's money well absolutely I mean you'll take
[3:37:24.240 --> 3:37:29.280]  advantage of their stupidity Ron Paul in the show last week said that Bernanke
[3:37:29.280 --> 3:37:34.440]  and Greenspan and Paulson should be arrested they've clearly enlisted some
[3:37:34.440 --> 3:37:39.720]  of the crimes they've been committing and I think you know instead of the
[3:37:39.720 --> 3:37:43.200]  criminals that engineered this now getting to take over even more of the
[3:37:43.200 --> 3:37:48.480]  crisis they created I think it sends a good message to start grand jury
[3:37:48.480 --> 3:37:53.440]  indictments and that would be great but of course you know it's not happy look
[3:37:53.440 --> 3:37:57.520]  at Paulson I mean poor Paulson was running Goldman Sachs I mean he was part of
[3:37:57.520 --> 3:38:00.600]  the problem that's what I mean look at that conflict of interest bailout
[3:38:00.600 --> 3:38:04.720]  right without this bailout Goldman Sachs would go out of business and it's not
[3:38:04.720 --> 3:38:08.360]  you know and it's because of a lot of the things that Goldman Sachs did when
[3:38:08.360 --> 3:38:12.080]  Henry Paulson was in charge well shouldn't Ron Paul and others in
[3:38:12.080 --> 3:38:18.680]  Congress shouldn't Congress be saying at least you're to blame and then
[3:38:18.680 --> 3:38:23.080]  dealing with it from that perspective instead of just bowing down before the
[3:38:23.080 --> 3:38:26.520]  people I mean it's so amazing to see Democrat and Republican leaders the
[3:38:26.520 --> 3:38:31.960]  president the Treasury Secretary the Fed head or the private Fed go on TV and
[3:38:31.960 --> 3:38:37.840]  say go on TV I mean I want your take on this go on TV and say you give us what
[3:38:37.840 --> 3:38:41.880]  we want and you give us unlimited power and that's what the first two versions
[3:38:41.880 --> 3:38:45.840]  said the new one says similar things or there's gonna be a depression I mean that
[3:38:45.840 --> 3:38:51.440]  itself should have sent us and it's not like look it wasn't not too long ago
[3:38:51.440 --> 3:38:55.320]  Paulson was saying it was the greatest global economy he's seen in his lifetime
[3:38:55.320 --> 3:38:58.760]  that the U.S. economy had never been in better shape and now we're on the verge
[3:38:58.760 --> 3:39:03.720]  of an economic collapse how can that be obviously if he's right now he was wrong
[3:39:03.720 --> 3:39:08.000]  then the guy is so incredibly incompetent why should we give him all this
[3:39:08.000 --> 3:39:11.320]  power well they're not they know they've been lying the whole time it's like a
[3:39:11.320 --> 3:39:15.640]  month ago and look those congressmen and senators right in the eye and said if you
[3:39:15.640 --> 3:39:18.360]  put a bazooka in my pocket I'll never use it
[3:39:18.360 --> 3:39:31.480]  Peter Schiff I agree Peter Schiff how is this gonna play out I've been really
[3:39:31.480 --> 3:39:34.480]  good at predicting what's gonna happen there they're following the bad course
[3:39:34.480 --> 3:39:38.040]  I agree with you it looks like they're gonna go ahead and follow the worst
[3:39:38.040 --> 3:39:42.560]  possible course but at least it's without the will of the people and so now
[3:39:42.560 --> 3:39:47.080]  when it really runs its course then we may have a chance of finally going to
[3:39:47.080 --> 3:39:50.960]  create massive inflation a lot of unemployment what's gonna happen is
[3:39:50.960 --> 3:39:54.520]  you're gonna really start to see food prices and energy prices and other
[3:39:54.520 --> 3:39:57.520]  things start to get very very expensive but the government will probably
[3:39:57.520 --> 3:40:02.000]  ultimately impose price controls on energy on food products which will create
[3:40:02.000 --> 3:40:06.640]  shortages of gasoline and food and long lines and black markets and the civil
[3:40:06.640 --> 3:40:09.880]  unrest I mean I think it's gonna be a real mess and eventually I think they're
[3:40:09.880 --> 3:40:13.360]  gonna impose capital controls I think they'll make it illegal for Americans to
[3:40:13.360 --> 3:40:17.280]  buy foreign currencies or to buy gold or anything you know the government is
[3:40:17.280 --> 3:40:20.840]  gonna try to deal with all the symptoms and none of the problems which is one
[3:40:20.840 --> 3:40:23.400]  of the reasons that people need to act quickly I mean that's what we're doing
[3:40:23.400 --> 3:40:27.760]  you know my brokerage firm is called Euro Pacific Capital and the website for
[3:40:27.760 --> 3:40:32.320]  the firm is EuroPak.net but what we're helping people do is get their
[3:40:32.320 --> 3:40:36.840]  money out of US dollars and accumulate foreign assets precious metals while it's
[3:40:36.840 --> 3:40:41.040]  still legal and while the dollar still has value and I would recommend you
[3:40:41.040 --> 3:40:45.840]  to look at somebody but people who have a lot of financial assets have to act
[3:40:45.840 --> 3:40:49.760]  quickly otherwise they're gonna watch an entire lifetime of savings and
[3:40:49.760 --> 3:40:54.080]  investments just go up to smoke well that's the fact the establishment the
[3:40:54.080 --> 3:40:58.080]  big you know top guys run in the criminal operation they plan to blame
[3:40:58.080 --> 3:41:02.120]  this on capitalism they plan to manage this crisis they engineered into a
[3:41:02.120 --> 3:41:06.320]  total police state as you said and they're moving in heavy armored brigades
[3:41:06.320 --> 3:41:11.840]  saying in the Army times it's for civil unrest they've set up Northcom they
[3:41:11.840 --> 3:41:15.560]  passed the John Warner Defense Authorization Act two years ago saying
[3:41:15.560 --> 3:41:19.760]  it was for martial law they have been planning this all along now we can
[3:41:19.760 --> 3:41:23.720]  debate whether they've lost control of it but but clearly from the IMF and
[3:41:23.720 --> 3:41:26.760]  World Bank documents and other plans what we've seen them do with the third
[3:41:26.760 --> 3:41:31.520]  world model is they have engineered collapses before do you believe this is
[3:41:31.520 --> 3:41:35.120]  engineered or are you gonna say no they've just lost control.
[3:41:35.120 --> 3:41:40.000]  I just think it's a comedy of errors I actually think that these people have
[3:41:40.000 --> 3:41:44.040]  good intentions I don't I don't I don't I don't read into it an evil motive have
[3:41:44.040 --> 3:41:47.360]  you ever read the IMF World Bank documents? I just think that just
[3:41:47.360 --> 3:41:50.840]  completely incompetent and they're looking out for their own self-interest
[3:41:50.840 --> 3:41:56.600]  and and and they just knew five years ago to secretly start federally
[3:41:56.600 --> 3:42:03.160]  getting rid of Posse commentatus for an economic collapse. I don't have
[3:42:03.160 --> 3:42:06.680]  an nefarious motive and I don't think they're smart enough to say hey let's
[3:42:06.680 --> 3:42:10.360]  collapse the economy ourselves. Well they're in control of things.
[3:42:10.360 --> 3:42:14.720]  They're just making mistakes they're just doing things wrong they just there's so
[3:42:14.720 --> 3:42:18.480]  much ignorance out there and I believe that a lot of these senators who voted
[3:42:18.480 --> 3:42:21.720]  for this bill really believe they're doing the right thing I don't think
[3:42:21.720 --> 3:42:24.880]  they're evil people I just think they're they're they're they're they're
[3:42:24.880 --> 3:42:29.320]  either way you cut it as you know it's the same thing the same
[3:42:29.320 --> 3:42:34.960]  thing's gonna happen in the end and and as soon as the yuppies finally stop
[3:42:34.960 --> 3:42:39.320]  believing CNBC and finally do buy gold and silver we've already got the mint
[3:42:39.320 --> 3:42:43.000]  shutting down selling a lot of their coins not just the buffalo as you know
[3:42:43.000 --> 3:42:46.600]  by the time the average American wakes up and tries to buy gold it'll be thousands
[3:42:46.600 --> 3:42:50.720]  of dollars an ounce oh sure how how do you think gold's gonna go by the end of
[3:42:50.720 --> 3:42:53.720]  this how long is this gonna run by the end of the year I don't know I was
[3:42:53.720 --> 3:42:57.440]  forecasting $2,000 gold sometime next year and I still think that's a
[3:42:57.440 --> 3:43:02.160]  reasonable target but you know ultimately there's no ceiling to what the
[3:43:02.160 --> 3:43:05.480]  price of gold can go to because there's no floor for the dollar I mean look
[3:43:05.480 --> 3:43:08.800]  where the price of gold is in the bagway I mean it's billions of dollars an
[3:43:08.800 --> 3:43:12.320]  ounce actually I think it's trillions of dollars an ounce so you know if you
[3:43:12.320 --> 3:43:16.160]  you can debate your currency down to nothing so I don't know gold might go
[3:43:16.160 --> 3:43:19.120]  to five or ten thousand dollars an ounce but it could go a lot higher I mean
[3:43:19.120 --> 3:43:21.920]  there's no way to know because you don't know where the dollar is gonna start
[3:43:21.920 --> 3:43:26.400]  going if we end up with a bug with style hyperinflation you're not gonna be
[3:43:26.400 --> 3:43:30.880]  able to have enough heroes to figure out the price of gold I agree so people
[3:43:30.880 --> 3:43:34.880]  better move into real assets and they better do it movie pronto let's go
[3:43:34.880 --> 3:43:38.920]  ahead and talk to who's up first there there's so many calls Kelly and Maine
[3:43:38.920 --> 3:43:46.000]  you're on the air Kelly worldwide Alex yes thanks for putting me on and I
[3:43:46.000 --> 3:43:50.200]  feel I'm thank you for shouting out to Justin TV earlier you bet you're on the
[3:43:50.200 --> 3:43:54.240]  air with Peter shift you have a question yes I do I want to know what will
[3:43:54.240 --> 3:43:58.320]  happen if the government will own the mortgages will they start building on
[3:43:58.320 --> 3:44:03.280]  the land like FDR did and yeah they're gonna have a lot of projects that I own
[3:44:03.280 --> 3:44:07.440]  are gonna be for land that already has a structure on it but what I think the
[3:44:07.440 --> 3:44:11.160]  government is gonna do once they acquire these mortgages is I think they are
[3:44:11.160 --> 3:44:16.520]  going to make deals with the homeowners and substantially reduce the mortgages
[3:44:16.520 --> 3:44:21.000]  that that people are by the way banks are already have their mortgages reduced
[3:44:21.000 --> 3:44:25.080]  dramatically Peter you're right but banks are already privately doing deals
[3:44:25.080 --> 3:44:28.960]  with people to substantially cut down on what things cost so people won't walk
[3:44:28.960 --> 3:44:34.200]  away yeah I'm in favor of that but what I'm not in favor of is the government
[3:44:34.200 --> 3:44:38.440]  buying overpaying for these mortgages and then doing the deals and pulling the
[3:44:38.440 --> 3:44:42.120]  losses on American citizens yeah what did you think of Bernack he's saying he
[3:44:42.120 --> 3:44:46.680]  wants to wants the government to pay premium prices but they have to pay
[3:44:46.680 --> 3:44:49.880]  premium prices otherwise they would bankrupt all the entities are trying to
[3:44:49.880 --> 3:44:53.520]  bail out that's the whole joke the government is trying to pretend they're
[3:44:53.520 --> 3:44:57.480]  gonna make money unbelievable that's a clock Kelly anything else no that's it
[3:44:57.480 --> 3:45:01.840]  thank you thank you let's go ahead now and talk to Clifford and Pennsylvania
[3:45:01.840 --> 3:45:08.160]  you're on the air with beer chef yes sir mr. chef I'm a you have my account
[3:45:08.160 --> 3:45:16.040]  already and I did well I'm done 15% in the last two weeks and I spoke to mr.
[3:45:16.040 --> 3:45:22.960]  Luke Castle which today and I spoke about precious metals and he and you're
[3:45:22.960 --> 3:45:27.320]  talking about precious metals and he told me what if it went down the way it
[3:45:27.320 --> 3:45:30.440]  can go down it's a volatile how would I feel about that because I was I was
[3:45:30.440 --> 3:45:35.080]  concerned about the 15% loss because I thought by going with you I protect
[3:45:35.080 --> 3:45:38.720]  myself from it from the US border protecting yourself from the long-term
[3:45:38.720 --> 3:45:42.960]  erosion of the dollar not the day-to-day fluctuations in the market I mean you've
[3:45:42.960 --> 3:45:46.840]  had a big jump in the value of the dollar we've seen a big drop in commodity
[3:45:46.840 --> 3:45:50.200]  prices in the last let me comment on this because I you know I'm not in
[3:45:50.200 --> 3:45:55.360]  business with our guest mr. chef we have him on because he has a track record of
[3:45:55.360 --> 3:45:59.560]  being about 95% right on predictions the establishment I appreciate your call
[3:45:59.560 --> 3:46:03.560]  Clifford has trained us okay stay there then that the establishment has trained
[3:46:03.560 --> 3:46:07.680]  us to look at the market day-to-day week-to-week instead of on one year two
[3:46:07.680 --> 3:46:13.200]  year five year ten year graphs gold is going straight up commodities of every
[3:46:13.200 --> 3:46:16.200]  type are going straight up because they're still gonna have value and then
[3:46:16.200 --> 3:46:20.400]  that will be adjusted with currencies as they're devalued okay and so you know
[3:46:20.400 --> 3:46:23.840]  I've read over shift he's saying invest in Europe invest in other places that's
[3:46:23.840 --> 3:46:27.040]  that's not gonna give you total protection it's statistically gonna give
[3:46:27.040 --> 3:46:30.760]  you a higher protection than being in the center of where the H bombs going off
[3:46:30.760 --> 3:46:35.120]  right here in the United States is that correct sir yeah it's just right now a
[3:46:35.120 --> 3:46:38.400]  lot of people are running towards the blast eventually they're gonna turn a
[3:46:38.400 --> 3:46:41.880]  lot and run away from the u.s. but yeah a lot of these foreign assets are going
[3:46:41.880 --> 3:46:44.720]  down right now but you know what it's a great time to buy them because we're
[3:46:44.720 --> 3:46:48.520]  getting a great deal it doesn't mean it's the absolute bottom but a few years
[3:46:48.520 --> 3:46:51.800]  from now we're gonna look back at these prices you know and and taking our
[3:46:51.800 --> 3:46:54.880]  self because we didn't buy even more well well I'll tell you this I'm about
[3:46:54.880 --> 3:46:59.720]  being a nothing but solid now because I don't trust any of it that's in any
[3:46:59.720 --> 3:47:03.320]  paper certainly people should be conservative the precious metals all
[3:47:03.320 --> 3:47:07.160]  the way you can't beat that it could go up or down but bottom line it has
[3:47:07.160 --> 3:47:10.960]  intrinsic value because of intrinsic scarcity real fast so I'm gonna get
[3:47:10.960 --> 3:47:14.720]  other callers in here finish up clevered well I mentioned that the gold
[3:47:14.720 --> 3:47:18.160]  multiple times in the last two weeks and I don't know what's going up and done
[3:47:18.160 --> 3:47:23.920]  but I'm with you and I'm looking for the protection of usage of assets and some
[3:47:23.920 --> 3:47:28.480]  of your managers don't think the same way I don't think you look at the stocks
[3:47:28.480 --> 3:47:32.840]  that we're buying our real assets we're buying utilities are buying all gas
[3:47:32.840 --> 3:47:36.560]  companies are buying commodity companies yeah they're not buying leverage paper
[3:47:36.560 --> 3:47:40.100]  we're buying real stuff around the world and getting dividend yields listen I
[3:47:40.100 --> 3:47:43.880]  appreciate your call you need to stocks go down clever you can you can you can
[3:47:43.880 --> 3:47:48.000]  call if you're in business with our guests talk to him then okay we gave you
[3:47:48.000 --> 3:47:51.560]  two questions let's go I mean look you're in a volatile market folks it's
[3:47:51.560 --> 3:47:56.280]  gonna get bad okay let's go ahead and talk to Chuck in Texas you're on the
[3:47:56.280 --> 3:48:03.520]  year go ahead yeah my question was in 1929 they tried to do a bailout sort of
[3:48:03.520 --> 3:48:08.640]  kind of they had somewhere from JP Morgan buy up a whole bunch of stocks no
[3:48:08.640 --> 3:48:14.080]  for a year it was a roller coaster yeah yeah and they were able to make it look
[3:48:14.080 --> 3:48:18.600]  like it was okay and then shortly after that the market started going back to
[3:48:18.600 --> 3:48:23.000]  getting all crazy again and then it just fell even harder than it was going to
[3:48:23.000 --> 3:48:27.200]  begin with yeah that's the whole point they know that they're just trying to
[3:48:27.200 --> 3:48:30.760]  shore up their assets and keep the whole thing going as long as they can let's
[3:48:30.760 --> 3:48:36.120]  again our guest take on that yeah yeah I mean no no question about but we what
[3:48:36.120 --> 3:48:40.320]  we have to do is we have to you know keep our mind on the bigger picture and
[3:48:40.320 --> 3:48:43.600]  what's gonna happen eventually to the value of the dollar and the fact that
[3:48:43.600 --> 3:48:47.480]  right now you know there is a global financial crisis because Americans we
[3:48:47.480 --> 3:48:50.960]  borrowed trillions of dollars from the world that we can't pay it back and so
[3:48:50.960 --> 3:48:54.560]  the people around the world who loaned us this money they're suffering because
[3:48:54.560 --> 3:48:58.360]  they've lost a lot of wealth they bet big on Americans and they lost we also have
[3:48:58.360 --> 3:49:01.720]  an arrogant really their economies are far healthier than ours we also have an
[3:49:01.720 --> 3:49:05.200]  arrogant predatory government that is going to keep squeezing as the states
[3:49:05.200 --> 3:49:08.840]  go bankrupt so watch your six folks all right now look some of the municipalities
[3:49:08.840 --> 3:49:12.400]  orders another big municipality it's about the fire of chapter 11 will be the
[3:49:12.400 --> 3:49:15.360]  biggest bankruptcy since Orange County and you know people are sitting in
[3:49:15.360 --> 3:49:18.760]  ministry bonds they think they're safe a lot of these minute municipalities are
[3:49:18.760 --> 3:49:22.320]  gonna be going bankrupt also several years and even the ones that don't all
[3:49:22.320 --> 3:49:25.680]  you're gonna get back his money that has very little value also the big brokers
[3:49:25.680 --> 3:49:29.200]  firms have been roping into the pension funds and retirement funds folks you're
[3:49:29.200 --> 3:49:32.880]  screwed get ready for the new world order let's go ahead and take another
[3:49:32.880 --> 3:49:37.360]  call here let's talk to Nick and Brooklyn you're on the air last caller for our
[3:49:37.360 --> 3:49:42.040]  guest go ahead on Alex how you doing good go ahead and talk listen I got a
[3:49:42.040 --> 3:49:46.080]  quick question are you familiar with a guy named Lyndon LaRouche yes I just an
[3:49:46.080 --> 3:49:49.320]  hour ago said that I don't agree with his solutions of big government
[3:49:49.320 --> 3:49:53.760]  okay so I must admit that because actually I just wanted to know you
[3:49:53.760 --> 3:49:57.040]  know get your take on that stuff well I mean he's right about a bunch of the
[3:49:57.040 --> 3:50:01.480]  problems but I don't agree with their big government socialist solution and
[3:50:01.480 --> 3:50:06.520]  we'll close out with Peter Schiff on that subject right now well I'm not even
[3:50:06.520 --> 3:50:10.800]  too familiar with the theories of Lyndon LaRouche I mean I know of him but I
[3:50:10.800 --> 3:50:13.560]  don't really I haven't really studied any of his stuff but yeah I'm sure he's I
[3:50:13.560 --> 3:50:17.480]  sure he I'm sure he's come to some big government-type conclusions and you know
[3:50:17.480 --> 3:50:20.160]  there's and I find a lot of agreement believe or not some of the people on
[3:50:20.160 --> 3:50:23.920]  the far left understand that there's some real problems in this country
[3:50:23.920 --> 3:50:27.200]  unfortunately they don't understand why these problems are here and their
[3:50:27.200 --> 3:50:30.840]  solutions will just make the problems worse look I'm against the bailout but
[3:50:30.840 --> 3:50:33.960]  if they're just gonna give it to the private bankers and we're gonna have
[3:50:33.960 --> 3:50:37.760]  socialism and I will just give us if they're gonna value our currency just
[3:50:37.760 --> 3:50:41.360]  give us all a $50,000 check I mean I mean and then that that would spur the

[3:54:45.280 --> 3:54:49.520]  basically being smooth though we've been economically losing more and more of

[3:54:54.200 --> 3:55:00.480]  are ahead and now more than ever I need you the listeners of this radio show to
[3:55:00.480 --> 3:55:03.680]  get on other radio talk shows not just here on the network other than
[3:55:03.680 --> 3:55:09.400]  Patreon networks or other rinky-dink web things but I need you to get on mainstream
[3:55:09.400 --> 3:55:13.920]  talk radio on stations that air my show other ones and talk about how the
[3:55:13.920 --> 3:55:17.440]  bankers are engineering this how bottom line whether they did it by design or not
[3:55:17.440 --> 3:55:21.800]  they engineered it they did it and and and how they're bringing us into some
[3:55:21.800 --> 3:55:24.880]  really bad times and for all the governments and everybody else who's
[3:55:24.880 --> 3:55:30.320]  been laughing and giggling of government people look the party's over we got
[3:55:30.320 --> 3:55:38.920]  taken now Ted sold out of the almost all of the
[3:55:38.920 --> 3:55:43.320]  buffaloes the government ran out of them they can't get the gold literally to
[3:55:43.320 --> 3:55:47.200]  make them other coins the US Mint makes are in short supply they're limiting
[3:55:47.200 --> 3:55:51.120]  them to you know one or two coins per person and you can't get buffaloes from
[3:55:51.120 --> 3:55:56.200]  them Ted has some left but he's limiting it to one coin per person these are the
[3:55:56.200 --> 3:56:01.080]  beautiful one-ounce buffaloes he's got a bunch of others even American Eagles are
[3:56:01.080 --> 3:56:05.120]  shooting up you can't get them anywhere near spot everything's getting a
[3:56:05.120 --> 3:56:10.480]  premium it's getting hard to get the French and European Frank's Ted has
[3:56:10.480 --> 3:56:17.240]  them these are great coins right at melt Ted get some before gold goes up he
[3:56:17.240 --> 3:56:19.920]  passes it on to you so I just briefly in the way at the very end of the show
[3:56:19.920 --> 3:56:24.600]  before we go into rebroadcast on the in on the internet at info wars.com the
[3:56:24.600 --> 3:56:28.560]  podcast and come back lively M&M tomorrow or on stations across the

[3:56:49.720 --> 3:56:53.400]  went on eBay just to see what they're getting for these things the closest one
[3:56:53.400 --> 3:56:57.640]  that I could find what I'm selling it for is 960 bucks and most of them are up
[3:56:57.640 --> 3:57:01.320]  at 1100 that's how that's how much they're carrying premiums in the
[3:57:01.320 --> 3:57:04.840]  marketplace right now because there's nothing available in addition to this
[3:57:04.840 --> 3:57:10.280]  the Franks that I'm selling right now at 190 a piece at the at the moment you
