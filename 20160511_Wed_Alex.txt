[00:00.000 --> 00:09.360]  We're live broadcasting worldwide on this Wednesday transmission.
[00:09.360 --> 00:12.040]  This is what the TPP means to your future jobs.
[00:12.040 --> 00:16.900]  On November 5th, 2015, the TPP was finally released to the public.
[00:16.900 --> 00:20.840]  On the very same day, President Obama declared he would sign it.
[00:20.840 --> 00:24.680]  Twelve countries participated in negotiations for the TPP.
[00:24.680 --> 00:28.800]  All twelve signed the TPP on February 4th, 2016.
[00:28.800 --> 00:34.960]  The agreement will enter into force after ratification by all signatories, if ratified within two
[00:34.960 --> 00:35.960]  years.
[00:35.960 --> 00:42.160]  If the agreement is not ratified by all before February 4th, 2018, it will enter into force
[00:42.160 --> 00:48.600]  after ratification by at least six states, which together have a GDP of more than 85%
[00:48.600 --> 00:50.960]  of the GDP of all signatories.
[00:50.960 --> 00:56.520]  For the time being, unfortunately, it's an election year and Obama is a lame duck president.
[00:56.520 --> 01:02.520]  It will be a photo finish for the TPP within the confines of Obama's temporary reign.
[01:02.520 --> 01:05.920]  Why can't Obama do something that actually helps Americans?
[01:05.920 --> 01:11.320]  He's not really supporting anything to do with America or the Constitution.
[01:11.320 --> 01:14.700]  That's like for pathetic human scum.
[01:14.700 --> 01:20.240]  The TPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a so-called trade agreement that basically
[01:20.240 --> 01:23.000]  creates a legalized one-world government.
[01:23.000 --> 01:29.320]  A legal bulwark into the sovereignty of nations, delivering poisonous food shipped right to
[01:29.320 --> 01:35.600]  your local grocery store, and those prescriptions that you desperately needed will now be unaffordable
[01:35.600 --> 01:38.680]  as Big Pharma gets all it ever wished for.
[01:38.680 --> 01:40.680]  And that's just the TPP.
[01:40.680 --> 01:43.800]  There are two other heads to this hydra that we are aware of.
[01:43.800 --> 01:51.480]  The ultra-secretive TISA, or Trade in Services Agreement, intended to be classified for five
[01:51.480 --> 01:53.880]  years after being signed.
[01:53.880 --> 01:58.160]  Fortunately for us, key portions of it were exposed by WikiLeaks.
[01:58.160 --> 02:04.400]  TISA essentially clears the way for the multinational corporations to regulate the management of
[02:04.400 --> 02:06.040]  public laws.
[02:06.040 --> 02:09.920]  TISA would also privatize state-owned enterprises.
[02:09.920 --> 02:15.680]  And let's not forget the knockout punch thrown by the TTIP, or the Transatlantic Trade and
[02:15.680 --> 02:17.320]  Investment Partnership.
[02:17.320 --> 02:22.720]  Essentially, forming a more imperfect union between the United States and the European
[02:22.720 --> 02:23.720]  Union.
[02:23.720 --> 02:29.040]  The profound changes on the horizon are why the puppets of the multinational corporations
[02:29.040 --> 02:34.400]  felt it was time to clue future generations in on the wonderful devastation they have
[02:34.400 --> 02:36.480]  in store for their future.
[02:36.480 --> 02:40.440]  Of course, explaining it bluntly isn't what they had in mind.
[02:40.440 --> 02:47.440]  They felt they should sugarcoat the truth with total bullsh**t.
[03:10.440 --> 03:16.440]  A given take of democracy has been repealed by one party rule, and I will show you a country
[03:16.440 --> 03:18.560]  that does not work.
[03:18.560 --> 03:25.000]  There are no walls big enough to stop people from anywhere, tens of thousand miles away,
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.160]  who are determined to take their own lives while they target others.
[03:29.160 --> 03:32.800]  So I think that everything that we've lived and learned tells us that we will never come
[03:32.800 --> 03:40.360]  out on top if we accept advice from soundbite salesmen and carnival barkers who pretend
[03:40.360 --> 03:46.320]  the most powerful country on earth can remain great by looking inward, and hiding behind
[03:46.320 --> 03:53.320]  walls at a time that technology has made that impossible to do and unwise to even attempt.
[03:53.320 --> 04:00.560]  The future demands from us something more than a nostalgia for some rose-tinted past
[04:00.560 --> 04:06.320]  that did not really exist in any case, and I think that everyone here, especially the
[04:06.320 --> 04:13.600]  class of 2016, understands that, this really, internally, intellectually, you're about to
[04:13.600 --> 04:17.320]  graduate into a complex and borderless world.
[04:17.320 --> 04:20.440]  Congratulations, class of 2016.
[04:20.440 --> 04:26.760]  Your future of endless financial aid payments, robot replacements, and a multinational screwjob
[04:26.760 --> 04:32.960]  to your chosen career, diet, national sovereignty, and healthcare is on the verge of being set
[04:32.960 --> 04:38.800]  to be transgender, though, on the fast track to be guaranteed to begin in 2018, so are you
[04:38.800 --> 04:41.720]  still convinced that Obama was a great president?
[04:41.720 --> 04:42.720]  Look how helpless they are.
[04:42.720 --> 04:51.360]  You all have some work to do, so enjoy the party, because you're going to be busy.
[04:51.360 --> 04:53.560]  John Donner, FreeDoors.com.
[04:53.560 --> 04:54.560]  Enjoy the club.
[04:54.560 --> 04:55.560]  You ain't in it.
[04:55.560 --> 04:56.560]  We'll be back.
[04:56.560 --> 04:58.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[04:58.960 --> 05:02.400]  We're broadcasting worldwide.
[05:02.400 --> 05:07.440]  All the perplexities, the confusion and distress in America arise not from objects in their
[05:07.440 --> 05:13.000]  Constitution or Confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from the downright
[05:13.000 --> 05:16.400]  ignorance of the nature of coin, credit, and circulation.
[05:16.400 --> 05:20.520]  Those are the words of John Adams, the second president of the United States.
[05:20.520 --> 05:23.080]  Are you ignorant of the private federal reserve?
[05:23.080 --> 05:25.840]  Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency?
[05:25.840 --> 05:31.040]  Do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles
[05:31.040 --> 05:32.480]  and to profit from it?
[05:32.480 --> 05:36.800]  What kind of leverage do these people and the Federal Reserve have over the American people?
[05:36.800 --> 05:41.560]  Or for that matter, what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money?
[05:41.560 --> 05:43.840]  Will you be a slave or will you be free?
[05:43.840 --> 05:48.920]  Adams also said liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people.
[05:48.920 --> 05:54.320]  Join the InfoWars, spread the information, educate yourself and others, the truth shall

[08:08.340 --> 08:11.340]  Waging war on corruption.
[08:11.340 --> 08:19.340]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[08:31.340 --> 08:40.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are launched ready. We are launched. On this Wednesday,
[08:40.440 --> 08:45.440]  the 11th day of May, 2016 global transmission. I'm your host Alex Jones.
[08:45.440 --> 08:48.840]  We are, of course, mainly a radio transmission on hundreds of affiliates
[08:48.840 --> 08:53.760]  across the United States. Global satellite, shortwave, you name it. But also
[08:53.760 --> 08:57.780]  channel casting on some TV stations, cable stations around the country, and
[08:57.780 --> 09:03.640]  living color streaming full television news production at infowars.com
[09:03.640 --> 09:08.880]  forward slash show. And I tell you, I'm actually enjoying this broadcast so far
[09:08.880 --> 09:13.540]  because I'm not somebody that likes big, bright lights in my eyes. I used to really
[09:13.540 --> 09:17.040]  love just doing radio in a dark room with a little light shooting down on the
[09:17.040 --> 09:21.240]  table where I could focus in on the news. But I wanted to play videos. I wanted to
[09:21.240 --> 09:27.480]  show photos. I wanted to show documents back in 1996-97 before the internet had
[09:27.480 --> 09:33.360]  become more ubiquitous, more popular, more widespread. It was really expensive to
[09:33.360 --> 09:37.320]  show somebody a video clip or even show an article. You could put a photo up and
[09:37.320 --> 09:41.320]  it might get read a million times, but you'd get a bill for $5,000.
[09:41.320 --> 09:47.480]  Damn, it was much more expensive. So I began basically trying to develop the
[09:47.480 --> 09:51.760]  technologies and systems or find the technologies and systems to stream
[09:51.760 --> 09:55.520]  video on the internet. And we are, of course, one of the first to do that with
[09:55.520 --> 09:59.160]  radio slash television. It's been duplicated a lot today by Glenn Beck,
[09:59.160 --> 10:01.840]  the young Turks, and many others. But this is one of the first times I've ever
[10:01.840 --> 10:06.720]  worn sunglasses on air. And that's because I got a piece of sand or glass in my
[10:06.720 --> 10:10.680]  right eye and then it got infected. It's getting better, but I look like something
[10:10.680 --> 10:14.920]  out of a out of a horror movie right now. So I'm going to be dawning the Blues
[10:14.920 --> 10:20.680]  Brothers glasses here today. And I am really enjoying not having as much
[10:20.680 --> 10:24.440]  blaring light in my in my face. But watch, this will become the big topic.
[10:24.440 --> 10:28.360]  Alex Jones wearing sunglasses instead of all the amazing news we're about to
[10:28.360 --> 10:33.720]  cover. At least with the mainstream media. It's better than an eyepatch. I was
[10:33.720 --> 10:37.000]  thinking about an eyepatch, but that was a little too much. So we're going to go,
[10:37.000 --> 10:44.360]  we're going to go with the sunglasses here today. Okay, I'm really said this a
[10:44.360 --> 10:46.840]  thousand times, never really been able to do it, but I'm going to attempt as best I
[10:46.840 --> 10:51.720]  can to cover all the news today because it's so over the top important.
[10:51.720 --> 10:58.800]  Senate kicks off debate over reauthorizing controversial NSA program. No, it's
[10:58.800 --> 11:07.320]  illegal. Also, Senate Commerce Committee launches inquiry into Facebook over
[11:07.320 --> 11:13.160]  trending topics of censorship. And exactly what we told you years ago about
[11:13.160 --> 11:17.040]  Facebook that's been getting worse the last few months has been confirmed that
[11:17.040 --> 11:21.040]  they have algorithms set to block libertarian conservative nationalistic
[11:21.040 --> 11:25.520]  pro-Trump type information, which does show they're trying to create a
[11:25.520 --> 11:31.640]  monopoly of information. It is highly unethical and highly illegal, especially
[11:31.640 --> 11:34.960]  when you don't tell people you're doing it. This whole line about, well, they own
[11:34.960 --> 11:38.960]  the website. Yes, and they hold it out that it's a free open commons of ideas as
[11:38.960 --> 11:42.520]  long as you don't violate the quote rules, calling for violence or whatever.
[11:42.520 --> 11:48.200]  Now the rules say if you disagree with someone they can censor you. That is
[11:48.200 --> 11:51.920]  directly out of North Korea. So we're going to be breaking that down as well.
[11:51.920 --> 12:00.440]  An incredible article on infowars.com by Joshua Krause. We ought to get Krause
[12:00.440 --> 12:04.760]  on. This is exactly what's happening. This article is over the top important. I
[12:04.760 --> 12:10.280]  should probably cover the entire broadcast just on this today. This is so big.
[12:10.280 --> 12:18.800]  This is everything. The White House plans to make the suburbs less wealthy and
[12:18.800 --> 12:22.480]  white. You read the quotes, they say they're racist, they're bad, they're too
[12:22.480 --> 12:26.560]  wealthy. We're going to have zoning that basically shuts them down or
[12:26.560 --> 12:32.840]  subsidizes quote moving poor and minorities into them. Now what that really
[12:32.840 --> 12:37.160]  means is we're going to tax you, we're going to control you, and we are going to
[12:37.160 --> 12:42.320]  bring in helpless domesticated groups to create divide and conquer strategies.
[12:42.320 --> 12:46.160]  And then when there is racial tensions that the media is going to hype up, we're
[12:46.160 --> 12:53.120]  going to bring in strong cities, UN policies of social justice warriors slash
[12:53.120 --> 12:59.720]  community organizer operatives to further break down the civilization. Under
[12:59.720 --> 13:04.280]  agenda 21, you're not allowed to run to the country. And by the way, Hispanics,
[13:04.280 --> 13:08.120]  blacks, everybody's run into the country. And you go out to the country, hill
[13:08.120 --> 13:11.520]  country, you go to a homeschooling event or whatever. There are black families,
[13:11.520 --> 13:16.840]  Hispanic families, Asian families, I mean like a third of them. And everybody's
[13:16.840 --> 13:19.160]  getting along and everybody doesn't trust the government, everybody's not
[13:19.160 --> 13:23.240]  taking vaccines, everybody's trying to get Amish milk, and it's a beautiful
[13:23.240 --> 13:27.960]  thing happening. At homeschooling events at my house, and it looks like true
[13:27.960 --> 13:32.360]  diversity, but they're cool people and they all know what's going on. I would
[13:32.360 --> 13:36.000]  not invite a bunch of so-called liberal trendies, black, white, Hispanic, to my
[13:36.000 --> 13:41.560]  house in the country, because they literally will look for some reason to
[13:41.560 --> 13:44.840]  call the police on you or say your child has a birthmark, you must have beaten
[13:44.840 --> 13:48.560]  them and get in your face, because that's all they know is running around and
[13:48.560 --> 13:54.720]  identifying people that aren't following the mouse-a-tongue culture system. This
[13:54.720 --> 13:58.920]  article is so incredible. For leftist, multiculturalism isn't always about
[13:58.920 --> 14:02.920]  flooding a country with millions of immigrants from incompatible cultures,
[14:02.920 --> 14:06.680]  as we've seen in Europe over the past few years. It's also about integrating the
[14:06.680 --> 14:10.200]  cultures that already exist in the nation, as far as they are concerned, a
[14:10.200 --> 14:15.240]  neighborhood that lacks diversity is unacceptable. We must all be equal in all
[14:15.240 --> 14:21.040]  ways, even when it comes to the culture and appearances of our communities. You
[14:21.040 --> 14:25.640]  know, I live outside town, but I also got a small condo in closer to town, closer
[14:25.640 --> 14:30.880]  to my parents, and I took me three years, and I could never find any of the new
[14:30.880 --> 14:34.840]  condos they're building. They give tax incentives to to build them cheaper to
[14:34.840 --> 14:41.120]  the builders that had a fence around my condo, a little two and a half
[14:41.120 --> 14:45.120]  bedroom, so I had a little study, two and a half bedroom on the top, a kitchen and
[14:45.120 --> 14:51.400]  living room, and a entry way on the bottom, very small. Just when I stay in
[14:51.400 --> 14:57.880]  town or don't want to have to drive back out into the countryside, and I kept
[14:57.880 --> 15:01.120]  asking all the builders, I said, and by the way, you know, you're building say six
[15:01.120 --> 15:05.520]  condo buildings here, five there, I said, why are there no gates on these? They
[15:05.520 --> 15:09.840]  said, oh, the city won't give you a permit now to have a gate on your condos
[15:09.840 --> 15:15.440]  or apartments, and some of these had like 20 buildings with duplexes. They're
[15:15.440 --> 15:21.000]  talking 40 buildings, 40 homes. I ended up getting one on a little plot that has
[15:21.000 --> 15:27.640]  six duplexes on it, no fence, and the city, and I was told this by the
[15:27.640 --> 15:30.800]  builders, someone looked it up, they have quote guidelines, and it's like, oh, we
[15:30.800 --> 15:34.320]  want an open community. They want it where there's no security, where you can
[15:34.320 --> 15:39.360]  be robbed. They said we want a quote open neighborhood feeling. This was in
[15:39.360 --> 15:45.240]  South Austin, ladies and gentlemen, with projects a mile away, because again, they
[15:45.240 --> 15:51.160]  want to dock those all randomly around, and of course there's robberies in the
[15:51.160 --> 15:54.320]  areas and rape and all the rest of it, but you haven't got my guns yet, you
[15:54.320 --> 16:03.040]  bastards. That's just how they work. And now, agenda 21, we've been to the meetings,
[16:03.040 --> 16:05.600]  we've covered it, we've done the reports, you've seen them here, we ought to edit
[16:05.600 --> 16:08.920]  some of those back together, you know, just composite a bunch of the old reports
[16:08.920 --> 16:13.000]  together. When I say it, they go, oh, you mean cover it up? No, I mean, you know, take
[16:13.000 --> 16:18.000]  like hours of reports and edit them down to maybe a 30-minute report of agenda
[16:18.000 --> 16:22.840]  21 meetings where they make people come into the town hall and all these small
[16:22.840 --> 16:26.800]  towns around Austin that are exploding, and they go, oh, we'll give you tax
[16:26.800 --> 16:31.280]  exemption if you live in this 10-story condo building that even has a factory
[16:31.280 --> 16:34.760]  in the bottom of it, but no one else gets the exemptions, but if you sign on
[16:34.760 --> 16:38.720]  with us, you do, and then they just double the taxes on everybody else, the
[16:38.720 --> 16:41.920]  farmers and ranchers that have been there for four generations and ship in a
[16:41.920 --> 16:48.600]  bunch of people in 300 square foot. They're 300 square foot out in Elgin. In
[16:48.600 --> 16:53.080]  Austin, they're 250. Remember, that's the new liberal way. You get a 250
[16:53.080 --> 16:59.920]  square foot deal. It cost two and a half thousand dollars a month. Suddenly, the
[16:59.920 --> 17:03.760]  thousand square foot's five thousand when it was two and a half a year ago. It's
[17:03.760 --> 17:07.960]  how they scam you. They bring in all these coffin buildings to undercut
[17:07.960 --> 17:13.120]  everything, build up the numbers so that everything skyrockets in price. All these
[17:13.120 --> 17:17.040]  big fat cats and multinationals, foreign governments, own some of the buildings
[17:17.040 --> 17:22.880]  downtown. One of them was the action I was reading the paper is owned by the
[17:22.880 --> 17:29.560]  Dominican Republic. So, it's just go into the city governments, make laws to
[17:29.560 --> 17:35.640]  screw everyone, ship in unskilled laborers, third-world populations in the
[17:35.640 --> 17:43.920]  middle of small towns, have taxpayers build 10-story buildings in towns where
[17:43.920 --> 17:49.120]  the people in the town are like 2,000. It takes over, then multinationals move in,
[17:49.120 --> 17:54.440]  displace everything, and get lower tax rates. And don't worry though, they call
[17:54.440 --> 18:00.920]  it not being racist. Just like you don't like Obamacare, you're racist. You don't
[18:00.920 --> 18:06.000]  turn your guns in, you're racist. The new KKK is the NRA. Remember that line when
[18:06.000 --> 18:09.960]  the NRA was found at the counter of the KKK in part? And to train Northerners how
[18:09.960 --> 18:15.320]  to shoot. I mean, that's a fact. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. UKIP
[18:15.320 --> 18:19.840]  opposes the EU. The British government calls them Nazis, even though the EU plan
[18:19.840 --> 18:26.400]  was set up by the Nazis. Because the public doesn't know their butt from a
[18:26.400 --> 18:31.000]  hole in the ground. And the general public wants freebies. And the general
[18:31.000 --> 18:34.840]  public thinks backstabbing each other and not caring about anybody. It's how you
[18:34.840 --> 18:39.080]  get ahead. Everybody, especially women now, think it's cool to be hard and cynical
[18:39.080 --> 18:43.000]  and try to get an angle up on you and screw their bosses over. It's just
[18:43.000 --> 18:46.760]  epidemic in the different trade publications I read. But men do it too.
[18:46.760 --> 18:54.560]  And it's all just a entitled, dumbed-down TV generation trained to fall against
[18:54.560 --> 19:01.320]  21st century technology and scientific cultural takeovers. In the future, one
[19:01.320 --> 19:04.880]  thing is gonna trump it all. And that's gonna be relationships with people you
[19:04.880 --> 19:08.680]  can trust and that people you're committed to. The most valuable thing is
[19:08.680 --> 19:12.440]  people you can trust and people you're committed to. That's why we're trained to
[19:12.440 --> 19:16.480]  be alone, to not be committed, to not care about anybody, to not care about our
[19:16.480 --> 19:19.920]  kids if we happen to have them. But that's how you get ahead. So everybody's
[19:19.920 --> 19:26.920]  totally alone and totally pathetic. So I'm gonna get more into that article. And
[19:26.920 --> 19:33.480]  it goes on to say the federal government, which is multinational run by UNESCO is
[19:33.480 --> 19:39.000]  gonna come in with small area fair market rents and they're gonna come in
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.000]  with a subsidized government housing and plop them all out the middle of
[19:42.000 --> 19:48.040]  nowhere. And then they've got the new freedom initiatives to drug everybody.
[19:48.040 --> 19:53.920]  And then they've got the rural affairs committee set up by Obama with the
[19:53.920 --> 19:59.760]  Department of Defense and the CIA over it to put CIA in every small town to run
[19:59.760 --> 20:05.000]  the op. A good stove is at the top of the list for any serious survivalist. That's

[22:33.240 --> 22:37.160]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River. I loved
[22:37.160 --> 22:41.840]  my dad. But boy was he stubborn. He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[22:41.840 --> 22:45.880]  His excuse? He simply couldn't afford it. He wasn't a rich man by any means. At
[22:45.880 --> 22:49.760]  less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the

[23:03.880 --> 23:07.760]  Republican presidential candidate. I'm here to tell you about something that
[23:07.760 --> 23:11.880]  just might save your lives. You never know when there will be another Katrina
[23:11.880 --> 23:15.800]  and economic collapse or a serious drought. We should all have a little food
[23:15.800 --> 23:19.320]  storage that will carry us through tough times. I'm going to tell you about a
[23:19.320 --> 23:24.200]  great way to do that. A U.S. company named Harvest Right has a kitchen appliance
[23:24.200 --> 23:28.960]  that can help you be prepared. It's a home freeze-dryer. With the product you

[24:23.040 --> 24:30.480]  Dyer's Traits, that is some good music.
[24:34.560 --> 24:38.840]  Alright, let's take it back on the news. I'm gonna cover this more later, but when
[24:38.840 --> 24:41.960]  you read a headline like White House plans to make the suburbs less wealthy
[24:41.960 --> 24:46.840]  and white, that's just always the cover to screw everybody over. Like Obamacare.
[24:46.840 --> 24:52.080]  The headline should be, globalist-to-wage war on more independent rural
[24:52.080 --> 24:56.720]  communities not under globalist control. Domestication, consolidation program
[24:56.720 --> 25:02.120]  accelerates. Similar to programs carried out in Asia, Latin America, and Africa.
[25:02.120 --> 25:06.520]  I remember back in the 1980s, my dad was so excited. He said, they're opening up
[25:06.520 --> 25:10.640]  Mexico to buy land for the first time since Mexico was founded in the 1820s.
[25:10.640 --> 25:15.520]  He's like, it's incredible. And he goes, I want to buy land. So we go down to Cancun
[25:15.520 --> 25:18.600]  where he'd been before my first time. We drove to all these spots and there were
[25:18.600 --> 25:24.440]  UN signs and biosphere. And my dad spoke decent Spanish. He was talking to locals
[25:24.440 --> 25:28.480]  and I remember after a second trip down there, he goes, it's a big UN scam. They're
[25:28.480 --> 25:31.480]  forcing all the locals off their property, the Mayans, because they've been there
[25:31.480 --> 25:35.240]  so long. They don't even have deems to the property. They're not gonna let them
[25:35.240 --> 25:38.640]  fish anymore. They're gonna force them all up into the big cities. And my dad
[25:38.640 --> 25:42.080]  of course knew everything back then. And I'm hearing all this. And then later I
[25:42.080 --> 25:45.120]  went and looked it up. That's why Mexico City was like 10 million people in the
[25:45.120 --> 25:49.480]  80s. It's 35 million now. They just come with machine guns and force you off the
[25:49.480 --> 25:53.640]  land. The only people that haven't been forced off their land in Mexico are the
[25:53.640 --> 25:59.000]  people in Chiapas because they're just willing to fight to the death. And that's
[25:59.000 --> 26:03.240]  even though they're communists, we buy coffee from them. That's, I mean, the
[26:03.240 --> 26:06.200]  communists are the only ones that backed them. They've got that ideology. But
[26:06.200 --> 26:08.720]  really, they're just on the land. They have communes where they grow their own
[26:08.720 --> 26:12.880]  coffee and share the profits. That's just humans working together. Because
[26:12.880 --> 26:17.320]  communism will work at a local, you know, tribal level. Because you still got your
[26:17.320 --> 26:20.320]  house. You still got your wife, your kids, your, you know, your daughters, your
[26:20.320 --> 26:24.560]  sons, your husband, your grandmother, your grandfather, your family, your
[26:24.560 --> 26:29.960]  cemetery. You've been there. You've got communes where you go dump your, you know,
[26:29.960 --> 26:32.560]  food in there and they kind of look at how much you dumped in. And that's the
[26:32.560 --> 26:37.840]  share you get. That's truly communal sharing. And they grow coffee together
[26:37.840 --> 26:41.760]  and they kill federales together. And that's a good example because the
[26:41.760 --> 26:44.880]  globalists can't come in and kick them out. Right through on the border with
[26:44.880 --> 26:48.520]  Guatemala. And that's where America, a wake of America coffee comes from. I'm not
[26:48.520 --> 26:51.040]  plugging it, but I think it's the best coffee. And then I found out the
[26:51.040 --> 26:55.800]  background of it and got my own sources down there. But I really like it. This is
[26:55.800 --> 26:59.680]  what it's all about. And they're coming in to force you off your land. They're
[26:59.680 --> 27:04.760]  coming in to shut down. Why are there wars on lemonade stands? Why are there
[27:04.760 --> 27:09.280]  wars on swap meats and the Amish Forbes magazine asked the questions. The
[27:09.280 --> 27:12.520]  Associated Press says, why are there federal task forces out trying to shut
[27:12.520 --> 27:18.560]  down people that don't have permits at Christmas holiday events selling
[27:18.560 --> 27:23.240]  mistletoe? Because they don't want humans used to going and having their own
[27:23.240 --> 27:27.000]  barter and their own systems because even if the globalists take over, if a
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.680]  handful of people have seeds and a handful of people know how to do
[27:29.680 --> 27:34.320]  machine work and a handful of people know how to weave and if a handful of
[27:34.320 --> 27:38.720]  people know how to farm and if a handful of people know how to manufacture
[27:38.720 --> 27:43.520]  its game over, we can instantly start over during a depression. They're not
[27:43.520 --> 27:47.400]  going to let that happen. During this depression, they're gonna ban cash. It'll
[27:47.400 --> 27:51.040]  still be cash, but it'll be digital. That told you 10 years ago or 15 years ago.
[27:51.040 --> 27:56.600]  That's now been announced. I can just see where the enemy's going. And they're
[27:56.600 --> 27:59.440]  getting ready to launch on every front. I don't know if it's this year, next year,
[27:59.440 --> 28:04.400]  or whenever, but it's serious. And it's all engineered. I've got the news right
[28:04.400 --> 28:10.640]  here. Retail stocks are getting mauled. What gives? Forbs. What gives? There's
[28:10.640 --> 28:14.360]  no container ships going back and forth in the Atlantic, only a few in the
[28:14.360 --> 28:21.680]  Pacific. We are in cardiac arrest by design. Recession may loom for next U.S.
[28:21.680 --> 28:24.880]  president, no matter who it is, Bloomberg. They're just gonna admit we're in a
[28:24.880 --> 28:29.520]  depression basically. We're already in it. Macy slashes outlook as sales continue to
[28:29.520 --> 28:36.480]  fall. Yeah, I was by the bed comforter a few weeks ago because one got old. The dog
[28:36.480 --> 28:41.560]  was chewing holes in it. And there was no one there at Macy's. I had to look around
[28:41.560 --> 28:46.120]  for 20 minutes to buy a comforter top. I'd take it downstairs and buy it.
[28:46.120 --> 28:53.560]  Staples office depot shares plunge after merger blocked. And it goes on and on
[28:53.560 --> 28:57.040]  from there. We're gonna break that down. So Senate Commerce Committee launches
[28:57.040 --> 29:01.420]  inquiry into Facebook over trending topic censorship. That is so huge. Billy
[29:01.420 --> 29:04.720]  Corgan has sent me text messages pointing out this is just giant. We've
[29:04.720 --> 29:08.640]  got to force this issue. That's what he was here pushing a month ago. Notice now
[29:08.640 --> 29:12.520]  drudge has been covering it big for the last week and that forced it over the
[29:12.520 --> 29:16.680]  edge. And now the massive censorship and controls being looked at again. Senate
[29:16.680 --> 29:20.720]  kicks off debate over reauthorizing controversial NSA spying. We'll get into
[29:20.720 --> 29:28.040]  the latest primary with Sanders winning West Virginia. And also winning some
[29:28.040 --> 29:31.560]  other states. We're going to look at justice as reputation hangs on the
[29:31.560 --> 29:37.480]  balance of Clinton probe. We're going to look at measles outbreak in Memphis
[29:37.480 --> 29:44.480]  began at a mosque. We're also going to get into the latest terror threat news.
[29:44.480 --> 29:47.080]  And I'll tell you about all the big guests coming up, including a new
[29:47.080 --> 29:51.880]  interview never before seen Billy Corgan on this issue. We're on the march. The
[29:51.880 --> 29:58.920]  Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:01.480 --> 30:06.520]  All the perplexities, the confusion and distress in America arise not from
[30:06.520 --> 30:10.760]  objects in their Constitution or Confederation, not from want of honor or
[30:10.760 --> 30:15.120]  virtue. So much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit,
[30:15.120 --> 30:19.400]  and circulation. Those are the words of John Adams, the second president of the
[30:19.400 --> 30:23.800]  United States. Are you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve? Do you understand
[30:23.800 --> 30:28.440]  the nature of our fiat currency? Do you understand how a private corporation has
[30:28.440 --> 30:32.920]  the ability to create boom and bust cycles and a profit from it? What kind of
[30:32.920 --> 30:36.880]  leverage do these people and the Federal Reserve have over the American people?
[30:36.880 --> 30:41.040]  Or for that matter, what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money?
[30:41.040 --> 30:45.880]  Will you be a slave or will you be free? Adams also said liberty cannot be
[30:45.880 --> 30:50.520]  preserved without general knowledge among the people. Join the InfoWars. Spread

[33:01.720 --> 33:26.720]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:26.720 --> 33:56.520]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. I'm gonna play a whole bunch of special reports and key
[33:56.520 --> 34:00.520]  clips here in a moment, including a very powerful one that deserves to go mega viral.
[34:00.520 --> 34:05.600]  It's only about three and a half minutes long that Paul Watson shot yesterday. I was listening
[34:05.600 --> 34:13.240]  to the show yesterday, but I wasn't watching. And when he was talking about the guy that
[34:13.240 --> 34:19.280]  made a joke video about Hitler and the pug dog, and it's clearly not pro-Hitler, but
[34:19.280 --> 34:23.400]  even if it was pro-Hitler, you shouldn't get arrested in Scotland. I mean, where's the
[34:23.400 --> 34:28.560]  free speech on the Magna Carta? But he did get arrested and they're prosecuting him.
[34:28.560 --> 34:35.560]  And then Paul plays two different clips of John Cleese making fun of Hitler. This is
[34:35.560 --> 34:41.800]  a war on culture, folks, and a war on ideas, and they know what they're doing. People keep
[34:41.800 --> 34:47.760]  saying, oh, these are out-of-control idiots. They just don't know what they're doing. It's
[34:47.760 --> 34:55.600]  globally coordinated by the central banks on record. They've got it phased out in a
[34:55.600 --> 34:59.240]  complete plan. You just joined us. I got a piece of glass or something to my two days
[34:59.240 --> 35:03.440]  ago and it cut it up and it's really hurts in the light. So I'm wearing sunglasses, not
[35:03.440 --> 35:07.680]  trying to act cool. Though these aren't really cool sunglasses. I bought these in Italy and
[35:07.680 --> 35:10.440]  I tell you, I didn't even have these in the U.S. and they are just awesome. The Italians
[35:10.440 --> 35:15.240]  just don't know how to make sunglasses, shoes, coats, cars. You name it. And the women aren't
[35:15.240 --> 35:21.840]  half bad looking either. Anyways, I like Italians. What's left of them? Okay, let's just continue
[35:21.840 --> 35:33.320]  here going through the news. Before I plunge into that, we got a limited-run batch of it.
[35:33.320 --> 35:38.080]  It sold out in a week and a half. We have gotten more of it in. We could have just put
[35:38.080 --> 35:46.200]  out hundreds of different formulas, a private labeled, of different vitamin, mineral, multivitamin
[35:46.200 --> 35:50.400]  juices. There's a lot of good ones out there. I promote the Entenchi Tangerine. You buy
[35:50.400 --> 35:54.760]  it from us. We get some of the profit. It helps fund the operation. It's excellent.
[35:54.760 --> 36:00.480]  And then FullWarsHealth.com along with 400 other great items. But we've got 18 items
[36:00.480 --> 36:05.080]  now that we produce and I'm very, very proud. This is plant-derived, the full spectrum of
[36:05.080 --> 36:11.680]  minerals and vitamins. And it's concentrated. And it's less than most of the leading competitors
[36:11.680 --> 36:16.160]  out there. It's vitamin, mineral, fusion, and it's fruit punch flavor. I'm very, very
[36:16.160 --> 36:20.960]  proud of it. Even the different nutraceutical Nazis. And I don't mean that in a bad sense,
[36:20.960 --> 36:24.360]  the Seinfeld sense, you know, the folks that really want the highest quality, like the
[36:24.360 --> 36:29.400]  soup Nazi. The vitamin Nazis out there are really proud of our work. That's why on Big
[36:29.400 --> 36:34.160]  Third Party sites, it gets such incredible reviews. Vitamin, mineral, fusion is loaded
[36:34.160 --> 36:38.800]  with a full month supply of essential vitamins in each canister. Minerals and amino acids
[36:38.800 --> 36:43.280]  that your body needs. This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin products.
[36:43.280 --> 36:46.720]  The best part is ingredients of vitamin, mineral, fusion are plant-derived and the
[36:46.720 --> 36:52.160]  few that aren't are from the highest quality lab standard tested. Just some of the ingredients
[36:52.160 --> 36:57.280]  in vitamin, mineral, fusion include vitamin C, vitamin E zinc, magnesium, selenium, L,
[36:57.280 --> 37:02.160]  glutamine, alpha, lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and many others. Got a bunch of
[37:02.160 --> 37:06.880]  amino acids, all the minerals you name it. Visit infowarselife.com and get your bottle
[37:06.880 --> 37:11.960]  of vitamin, mineral, fusion today before we sell out again of its limited run. That's

[37:32.480 --> 37:37.960]  running. Be sure and check those out. But let's say you're addicted to soft drinks.
[37:37.960 --> 37:42.520]  Let's say you are, your kids love, you know, drinking too much oranges, which has some
[37:42.520 --> 37:47.360]  good stuff in it for you, but incredible sugar. This has fractions of that. It's naturally
[37:47.360 --> 37:53.200]  flavored with xylitol and it's just, even hardly has any of that because the stuff in
[37:53.200 --> 37:57.640]  it just naturally tastes so good. It's like vitamin B12 just tastes good in and of itself.
[37:57.640 --> 38:04.720]  Tastes like sugar. There's no sugar in it. And what I do is I take like a topochico that's
[38:04.720 --> 38:10.960]  really good in my view, Mexican naturally carbonated water and I put that in and then
[38:10.960 --> 38:15.680]  I stir up like a quarter scoop. It's so strong. I put ice in it and it's the best fruit punch
[38:15.680 --> 38:24.520]  ever. And it tastes just as good as, you know, a soda pop using the Yankee term, carbonated
[38:24.520 --> 38:29.600]  fruit drink. I mean, I like Coca-Cola. I like Pepsi. I can't drink it. It's got, you know,
[38:29.600 --> 38:34.160]  baby flavoring in the Pepsi and the Coca-Cola and all the rest of it is just so incredibly
[38:34.160 --> 38:38.880]  toxic. The others is overwhelming. Full of heavy metals. You name it for whatever reason.
[38:38.880 --> 38:43.440]  This stuff is all tested California level standard and it just is so delicious. I'll
[38:43.440 --> 38:47.560]  put it up against the best soft drink any day because yeah, soft drinks are bad for you.
[38:47.560 --> 38:51.840]  They taste incredibly delicious. Let's not lie about it. Well, we took us two years to
[38:51.840 --> 38:57.280]  develop this. I'm very proud of it. No artificial flavors. So it's not bright red. It's orange
[38:57.280 --> 39:06.720]  just pink and it's just amazing. My kids love it. I think they're multivibing right here.
[39:06.720 --> 39:15.040]  And it's so much more absorbable because it's being done as a liquid going through the digestive
[39:15.040 --> 39:20.280]  process, starting in the mouth with the saliva that begins to absorb it, adds the key cofactors,
[39:20.280 --> 39:23.800]  the key acids to break it down. It then goes into the stomach. It's got the amino acids,
[39:23.800 --> 39:32.200]  all of it in there. It just does amazing things. So I'm done plugging. The five mineral fusion
[39:32.200 --> 39:38.760]  is available back in stock at infowarsalife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139. Get all the

[39:42.200 --> 39:47.320]  like better? You know, a Sprite or a 7-up? I like them both. This is like a 7-up and
[39:47.320 --> 39:50.720]  then the Beyond Tangy Tangerine is like a Sprite. I mean, they're both delicious. They're
[39:50.720 --> 39:56.520]  both good for you. I sell both. I sell theirs and I sell mine and just people differ on
[39:56.520 --> 39:59.480]  what they like better. I think they all go to, this is plant-derived. There's is deep
[39:59.480 --> 40:05.160]  earth provided. It's just all a good mix for folks. So infowarsalife.com, for Beyond Tangy
[40:05.160 --> 40:10.120]  Tangerine, infowarsalife.com, provide them a mineral fusion.
[40:10.120 --> 40:15.480]  Okay. Let's now just one more thing. We had to end the big special on food because the
[40:15.480 --> 40:19.000]  competitors were getting upset. I mean, they distribute one of the biggest outfits in the
[40:19.000 --> 40:22.720]  country, my Patriot, super high quality. We sell all their products, but they have a
[40:22.720 --> 40:27.000]  lot of other distributors, a lot of other sellers, other private labelers, and they
[40:27.000 --> 40:30.560]  just don't like how low I go. And I said, can I please do it a few more days? They said,
[40:30.560 --> 40:34.240]  we told you no, please stop. I said, what about if I take the four best sellers we've
[40:34.240 --> 40:39.080]  got and just offer those at 40% off for one more week? They called me back. They said,
[40:39.080 --> 40:44.440]  yes, one more week, but that's it. We already had the lowest prices. You don't need to go
[40:44.440 --> 40:49.360]  this low. And I understand that, but I like to do this. I like to dominate. I like a win-win.
[40:49.360 --> 40:53.280]  I like to have loss leaders. Isn't quite a loss leader. We make some profit and it helps
[40:53.280 --> 40:56.360]  from the operation. So get your storeable foods now. I think you're crazy if you don't
[40:56.360 --> 40:57.360]  get it.
[40:57.360 --> 41:04.800]  M4store.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139. Separately, I got some sand or something swimming in the
[41:04.800 --> 41:10.880]  creek Monday night. Anthony came over. He swam with myself and the kids. We went around
[41:10.880 --> 41:15.680]  chasing fireflies in the, in the, in the, in the dusk and then he went home after dinner.
[41:15.680 --> 41:20.640]  But I was swimming around and I got some sand in my eye and it kind of cut my eye and something.
[41:20.640 --> 41:24.080]  And my dad looked at it in the morning and you know, he's a dentist, but he still knows
[41:24.080 --> 41:27.640]  it's metal. So he says, yeah, you got serration. You're cutting there. But then by yesterday
[41:27.640 --> 41:30.760]  it got infected. I never hardly get infected, but it got a little bright red and stuff.
[41:30.760 --> 41:33.960]  It's the point. I couldn't even open my eye yesterday. Now it's still red about half
[41:33.960 --> 41:37.400]  as red, but I can open my eye and I'll tell you if it works. Sometimes it works. Sometimes
[41:37.400 --> 41:40.680]  it doesn't. That's why you got to have a mix of mainline medicine and colloidal silver.
[41:40.680 --> 41:45.000]  But it's already getting a lot better. So I started putting it in yesterday and I'm
[41:45.000 --> 41:49.840]  going to put some colloidal silver in my eye right now. And it's one of the known powerful
[41:49.840 --> 41:53.120]  antibiotics out there where other stuff doesn't work. And again, if this, it's starting to
[41:53.120 --> 41:56.520]  help, but by tomorrow if it isn't 100% better, I'm going to go ahead and get the eyedrops
[41:56.520 --> 42:04.040]  there that are, you know, so toxic, but actually work a little silver in the eye and we will
[42:04.040 --> 42:09.040]  see how it works. I've done this with other infections over the last decade. I don't know
[42:09.040 --> 42:13.520]  four or five times on air. Three times it worked. One time it didn't. And the antibiotics
[42:13.520 --> 42:17.040]  had to do it. It's when I bumped into the Supreme Court building, this guard jumps out
[42:17.040 --> 42:21.360]  with, what are you doing? So I was videotaping up by the front door. It was on a Sunday.
[42:21.360 --> 42:25.880]  And I turned towards the big foot of the pillar. It was so high. It was up to my shin, cut
[42:25.880 --> 42:33.600]  through my jeans, cut the front of my leg. And then about a month later, pus started
[42:33.600 --> 42:37.520]  just gushing out of it. I don't want to get graphic here, but you know, infectious disease,
[42:37.520 --> 42:41.280]  one of the biggest killers is the bacteria becoming immune. The viruses are becoming
[42:41.280 --> 42:49.520]  immune resistant. Colloidal silver, iodine, natural herbs. By the time I went to the doctor
[42:49.520 --> 42:53.240]  and they x-rayed, it was rotted all the way down to my shin, all the way down to my foot
[42:53.240 --> 42:58.920]  inside. And within 24 hours of big injections of antibiotics, boom, it stopped. How magic.
[42:58.920 --> 43:03.920]  So I'm not bashing MD medicine, but it's like a nuclear option. The colloidal silver
[43:03.920 --> 43:07.560]  I was kind of putting into the wound didn't help. I guess it had already gotten so deep
[43:07.560 --> 43:11.680]  down. But other times when antibiotics didn't work with the chest colds and stuff that killed
[43:11.680 --> 43:15.680]  members of my family, remember three years ago, two years ago? Colloidal silver did.
[43:15.680 --> 43:19.440]  My dad was in bed for a month. Antibiotics weren't working third round. I dumped three
[43:19.440 --> 43:24.600]  bottles of colloidal silver down his throat, 30 parts per million. And it knocked it out
[43:24.600 --> 43:30.520]  a matter of days. Amazing. At least from my experience. In FullWarsLife.com, SilverBullet
[43:30.520 --> 43:33.000]  is there as well. And you're crazy if you don't get prepared. All right, I'm going to
[43:33.000 --> 43:37.400]  stop plugging. Please support our local MNF affiliates. Become a sponsor. Support the local
[43:37.400 --> 43:42.360]  sponsors. It is so essential. It is so important. I'll do a shorter plug next hour, but I wanted
[43:42.360 --> 43:49.920]  to get that in right there. Okay. Word of the begin. Where should we start? There is
[43:49.920 --> 43:54.040]  so much to go over here. I already mentioned some of this. I want to drill back into some
[43:54.040 --> 44:03.400]  of the articles we haven't hit yet. Shock. 50% of Bernie voters pick Trump over Hillary.
[44:03.400 --> 44:08.600]  Credible article by Kit Daniels needs to go so viral. If Hillary steals nomination, Trump
[44:08.600 --> 44:13.080]  gains Bernie votes. Half of Bernie Sanders supporters would vote for Donald Trump over
[44:13.080 --> 44:18.320]  Hillary Clinton at Fox News exit poll in West Virginia revealed. Now that is the coal miner
[44:18.320 --> 44:23.120]  area, but it's still 20, 30% in other areas we've seen. He's getting 20%, 25% with the
[44:23.120 --> 44:27.960]  black Americans. Normally go 10% Republican. I mean, folks get that he's populist. In fact,
[44:27.960 --> 44:33.240]  in some cases, he's too liberal folks. It's not that he's too extreme or racist in my
[44:33.240 --> 44:39.080]  issue, but that's a big 10 approach. Sanders won West Virginia with around 124,000 votes
[44:39.080 --> 44:43.800]  compared to Clinton's 86,000, meaning that possibly 72% of those votes Clinton received
[44:43.800 --> 44:49.000]  in the primary. Half of Sanders represent the Democrats who would vote for Trump. Trump's
[44:49.000 --> 44:56.000]  chances against Clinton may be better than anyone thought Fox News admitted. Well, CNN
[44:56.000 --> 45:01.360]  was in coal country in West Virginia and couldn't find one person out of 20 in a Democrat event
[45:01.360 --> 45:05.120]  who weren't going to vote for Trump. And if he gets that same nationalist message out
[45:05.120 --> 45:10.680]  to everybody else that actually wants to work and can work to quote Merle Haggard,
[45:10.680 --> 45:19.840]  little man can still work, still would, then it's game over for hair, hair hitlery. Speaking
[45:19.840 --> 45:22.880]  of hair hitlery, I'm going to air this since I mentioned it right now. It's only a few
[45:22.880 --> 45:28.040]  minutes long. The video is up on info wars.com, but I want to tweet it out again and post
[45:28.040 --> 45:33.120]  it on Facebook again because make fun of Hitler. You will be arrested. I mean, that's really
[45:33.120 --> 45:37.900]  what the headline should be. Paul's headline was pretty good. You know, make fun of Hitler
[45:37.900 --> 45:45.160]  on YouTube, get arrested, but it's really just make fun of Hitler, get arrested. Comedy
[45:45.160 --> 45:51.000]  is now illegal. Charlie Chaplin made fun of Hitler. I've made fun of Hitler. Remember,
[45:51.000 --> 45:56.920]  Jesse James made fun of Hitler and they said, Oh, you're a Nazi. This is an assault on reality.
[45:56.920 --> 46:02.120]  How dare people tell Americans and Scots and folks that died in mass fighting Hitler, our
[46:02.120 --> 46:08.120]  grandparents, that we're with Hitler. If some liberal trendy who's apologized and turns
[46:08.120 --> 46:12.200]  out he's a liberal, of course he apologized, should apologize and say, I didn't do anything.
[46:12.200 --> 46:17.400]  It's satire. It's protected, but by him groveling, they keep charging him. He should say, how
[46:17.400 --> 46:22.840]  dare you and get a jury trial. This is happening everywhere. We'll put the headline back up
[46:22.840 --> 46:27.480]  on screen. I want to put it on Facebook. I want to retweet it. Police now arresting YouTubers
[46:27.480 --> 46:34.840]  for offensive videos. No speeches say, folks. I've got a stack of news. A teacher in Germany,
[46:34.840 --> 46:38.480]  a teacher in Austria. There's two different stories today, one in Germany, one in Austria.
[46:38.480 --> 46:42.800]  The teacher in Austria talked about the Koran talking about Mohammed saying you can have
[46:42.800 --> 46:51.320]  sex with 12 year olds and said that's pedophilia and she's been arrested. Now folks, separately
[46:51.320 --> 46:56.200]  China has been caught shipping in little girls for sex slaves and they're calling it sex
[46:56.200 --> 47:03.400]  slavery. It is what it is, but this, even if it wasn't true that Mohammed said that,
[47:03.400 --> 47:09.120]  wrote that. You should have a right to say it. This is tyranny. Teacher to be prosecuted
[47:09.120 --> 47:14.600]  for calling Mohammed a child molester. The middle school teacher in the Austrian city
[47:14.600 --> 47:19.560]  is facing criminal prosecution for her comments regarding the founder of Islam and they've
[47:19.560 --> 47:24.800]  got Turkish people that make fun of Erdogan on TV in Germany being arrested. This is,
[47:24.800 --> 47:30.160]  the left is evil. They're not the left. They're a group of criminals coming to take over and
[47:30.160 --> 47:35.280]  they mean business and they've got every lazy, nobody brown shirt joining it on a power trip
[47:35.280 --> 47:39.320]  thinking they're about to get the spoils. The spoils disappear very quick dummies. Let's
[47:39.320 --> 47:43.040]  look at this, Venezuela. Let's go ahead and go to this incredible report by Paul Joseph
[47:43.040 --> 47:48.880]  Watson. 28 year old Marcus Meacham was arrested for hate crimes after posting this joke video
[47:48.880 --> 47:54.960]  of his girlfriend's dog reacting to Nazi slogans. My girlfriend is always ranting and
[47:54.960 --> 48:00.480]  raving about how cute and adorable her wee dog is and so I thought I would turn them
[48:00.480 --> 48:15.200]  into the least cute thing that I could think of which is a Nazi.
[48:15.200 --> 48:31.040]  The
[48:31.040 --> 48:37.320]  video went viral receiving 18,000 thumbs up to just 1200 thumbs down. The vast majority
[48:37.320 --> 48:41.880]  of viewers thought that it was hilarious but thanks to a small minority of perpetually
[48:41.880 --> 48:47.680]  offended retards Meacham got a home visit from the Scottish police. Authorities said
[48:47.680 --> 48:53.920]  that Meacham's arrest is a lesson to others that any video content deemed offensive will
[48:53.920 --> 48:59.600]  not be tolerated. Meacham then prostrated himself pleading that he wasn't a racist and that
[48:59.600 --> 49:04.680]  he only made the video to annoy his girlfriend. Isn't it interesting that John Cleese recently
[49:04.680 --> 49:10.240]  came out and decried political correctness because under that definition Cleese himself
[49:10.240 --> 49:26.240]  would have been arrested for this faulty tower sketch. He would have also been hit with
[49:26.240 --> 49:43.440]  hate crimes charges for this Monty Python sketch. Charlie Chaplin would have been thrown in
[49:43.440 --> 49:48.640]  a jail cell for the same reason. If they're now treating any video content whatsoever
[49:48.640 --> 49:54.160]  that causes offence as hate speech then my entire channel is hate speech. It's getting
[49:54.160 --> 49:59.320]  close to where I'm going to have to leave the country simply to continue to make YouTube
[49:59.320 --> 50:04.760]  videos. They're already arresting people who criticised Muslim immigration on Twitter.
[50:04.760 --> 50:11.480]  Now satire, frigging satire that's not even malicious will not be tolerated and this is
[50:11.480 --> 50:16.440]  by no means a one off case. Just a few days ago a Muslim police chief in Manchester said
[50:16.440 --> 50:21.720]  freedom of speech does not mean freedom of offending culture, religion or tradition.
[50:21.720 --> 50:26.320]  Just last month Greater Glasgow Police threatened to conduct home visits to harass people who
[50:26.320 --> 50:31.640]  made unkind or inaccurate tweets. Last year Police Scotland announced their intention
[50:31.640 --> 50:36.760]  to investigate offensive comments made on Twitter and other social media platforms.
[50:36.760 --> 50:41.880]  Of course this is all selectively enforced but the chilling effect is very real. This
[50:41.880 --> 50:46.680]  is how political correctness is strangling freedom. People are going to be terrified
[50:46.680 --> 50:52.640]  of expressing any political belief even if it's satirical, even if it's not even meant
[50:52.640 --> 50:59.240]  to be political. If we allow them to characterise Nazi jokes or Mohammed cartoons as hate speech
[50:59.240 --> 51:04.240]  then it's only the beginning. The end will bring us full circle. To the very reason
[51:04.240 --> 51:10.400]  political correctness was created in communist countries in the first place. To stifle,
[51:10.400 --> 51:16.880]  censor and punish anyone who dares speak out against the state or the prevailing cultural
[51:16.880 --> 51:17.880]  mantra.
[51:17.880 --> 51:28.000]  Great job Paul Watson. I'm going to take that little short video and just add a few other
[51:28.000 --> 51:34.000]  clips to it with the analysis I'm doing here as a larger video. What about all the Disney
[51:34.000 --> 51:40.520]  cartoons making fun of Hitler? Give this Nazi line so great we wouldn't leave it if we could.
[51:40.520 --> 51:46.360]  Just all the rest of the mindlessness. But what if you want to be pro-Nazi? You're allowed
[51:46.360 --> 51:51.280]  to do that in Europe. You're allowed to do that here in the US but not anymore. Now making
[51:51.280 --> 51:58.840]  fun of it isn't allowed and people go into JCPenney and they see a silver teapot which
[51:58.840 --> 52:03.720]  by the way is a really nice teapot and they think because there's a round handle that
[52:03.720 --> 52:08.160]  looks a little like a mustache and the handle could be hair. That's like seeing Hitler in
[52:08.160 --> 52:17.360]  a cloud. They want it banned. And guess what? JCPenney did ban it. They did ban it. And
[52:17.360 --> 52:23.920]  now it goes for a premium. And now they're saying don't wear black jackets. That could
[52:23.920 --> 52:29.800]  be a Nazi. This is the type of stuff that's coming on ladies and gentlemen. And now they're
[52:29.800 --> 52:35.600]  saying don't say I want Mexican or Chinese food because saying that the name could be
[52:35.600 --> 52:40.720]  hurtful. Every all knowledge is hurtful. By the way, during the video I remembered,
[52:40.720 --> 52:45.960]  I was four or five years ago, I did a video called Hitler dog with my French bulldog,
[52:45.960 --> 52:52.720]  still living, he's old now, Captain. And we made a joke about how since they're afraid
[52:52.720 --> 52:58.720]  of the teapot, that was in 2013, I guess three, three, four years ago, that I made the joke
[52:58.720 --> 53:03.960]  that oh no, now we've got Hitler dog. Perhaps you played part of Hitler dog. And then it
[53:03.960 --> 53:08.960]  gets worse. I mean, there's all these other cartoons and movies and people making fun
[53:08.960 --> 53:19.120]  of Hitler. But see, it's only selectively enforced. Look, there's Donald Duck as a Nazi.
[53:19.120 --> 53:25.280]  Arrest him. If this Nazi land's so good, we wouldn't leave it if we could. Oh, all
[53:25.280 --> 53:31.360]  right. That's a quote. They'll probably have New York Times say Jones said hall Hitler
[53:31.360 --> 53:36.960]  on air praying on their audience, thinking you're dumb. Obamacare is free. I have clips
[53:36.960 --> 53:41.160]  here with national news making fun of their dumb viewers going, we told them they could
[53:41.160 --> 53:46.480]  keep their doctor like grouper up there in a big university. I teach people how to lie
[53:46.480 --> 53:59.280]  and my lies are best. Like, oh, public so dumb, we're ripping them off. This is how sick
[53:59.280 --> 54:04.360]  these people are. In fact, do we have Hitler dog ready? Can we just play it right off YouTube?
[54:04.360 --> 54:08.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, I may be arrested if I ever travel to Scotland. And don't forget
[54:08.920 --> 54:14.120]  Michael Savage and hundreds of others are now banned from going to the UK because they
[54:14.120 --> 54:20.640]  criticize radical Islam. And the Communist Chinese went and funded US groups to blackball
[54:20.640 --> 54:26.640]  his book about China being a threat. That's how much control there is in this country.
[54:26.640 --> 54:32.480]  And we've had to deal with it and been threatened over talking about the House of Saud. We get
[54:32.480 --> 54:39.080]  told leave them alone. If you want to be on these stations, this is already going on.
[54:39.080 --> 54:45.640]  This is already happening in America. And it gets worse, ladies and gentlemen. It gets
[54:45.640 --> 54:52.040]  worse. This is the Talitarianism. The good news is it's becoming so blatant. These attempts
[54:52.040 --> 54:57.160]  to bully people that are literally authoritarian, literally Nazi like what the so called left
[54:57.160 --> 55:04.440]  is doing. This is a very important from international business times. Senate Commerce Committee
[55:04.440 --> 55:17.120]  launches inquiry into Facebook over trending topics censorship. Isn't that just special?
[55:17.120 --> 55:20.520]  So the good news is they tried to act like for the last few months where drugs made a
[55:20.520 --> 55:25.200]  big deal out of this. We made a big deal out of this international frontier foundation
[55:25.200 --> 55:27.840]  of the different internet groups made a big deal out of it. They went, oh, it's their
[55:27.840 --> 55:31.640]  website. They're allowed to do it. And their own employees started coming out saying, no,
[55:31.640 --> 55:37.240]  we completely block anything patriotic, anything pro Trump, anything pro gun, anything pro
[55:37.240 --> 55:43.720]  Benghazi investigation, anything anti Hillary mainline news is censored. You in America
[55:43.720 --> 55:48.480]  on your supposed Facebook where you and your friends share ideas, they don't let you share
[55:48.480 --> 55:55.760]  that info. They don't let people share videos that we post on Facebook. Now the first few
[55:55.760 --> 55:59.480]  months they weren't blocking us. But when the videos all started getting about a million
[55:59.480 --> 56:05.360]  views on average, some got four million views. Why in the market of ideas? We were winning
[56:05.360 --> 56:11.480]  can't have that. Can't have that. We had a Charlie Daniels video up there with a million
[56:11.480 --> 56:15.560]  and a half views in a week. Oh, someone else made a copyright claim, even though we have
[56:15.560 --> 56:20.560]  the authorization. That's just how all of this works to shut things down. Do we have
[56:20.560 --> 56:27.680]  Hitler dog guys? We're having a problem downloading. It doesn't matter. There's no need to fear
[56:27.680 --> 56:35.560]  Hitler dog is here. Oh, dear. Astronium 12 detonator. I'll have to destroy the earth
[56:35.560 --> 56:42.160]  that past the earth creature. Oh, dear. The floor. I didn't work on this one. He's fighting
[56:42.160 --> 56:47.440]  back against my takeover. Hurry. Chemtrail him immediately. I will have the technological
[56:47.440 --> 56:55.200]  developments for myself. This planet I declare for Bill Gates. See, I don't have Hitler dog.
[56:55.200 --> 57:03.120]  I've got what cartoon is that? That's that's that's Marvin the Martian merged with whoever
[57:03.120 --> 57:10.280]  says there's no need to fear underdog is here. That's kind of fun, isn't it? I should just
[57:10.280 --> 57:15.400]  join the new order, go to Hollywood and make a million dollars per movie on voiceovers.
[57:15.400 --> 57:20.240]  And I'm not bragging folks. People say I do this for money. I've been paid $800,000 in
[57:20.240 --> 57:24.360]  a year for a voiceover for a national ad. That's how much those unions pay you because
[57:24.360 --> 57:28.160]  they air the commercial thousands of times on national TV. And I got like checks, big
[57:28.160 --> 57:33.120]  checks every month for it. And then after a year, there was a backlash and they said,
[57:33.120 --> 57:36.680]  that's Alex Jones's voice. We don't like your company having Alex Jones voice. I got insurance
[57:36.680 --> 57:39.640]  companies want me to do the voices. They want me to be the guy that says, you know, the
[57:39.640 --> 57:46.640]  big movie trailers coming this November. But I don't do it. I stay here and I do this.
[57:46.640 --> 57:51.120]  But I tell you, it's a very pleasurable feeling that I don't need to be successful. This is
[57:51.120 --> 57:55.160]  the radio talk shows or Patriot. I do this because I choose to. I can make more money
[57:55.160 --> 57:59.760]  doing voiceovers. I'd probably be one of the top voiceover people in the world if I wanted
[57:59.760 --> 58:04.960]  to. And I tell you what's even better about that. I don't even sit here and do a fake
[58:04.960 --> 58:08.920]  voice on air. This is my real voice right here. I bet I could sit there with a radio
[58:08.920 --> 58:13.480]  voice that Glenn Beck wishes he could do. But I'm not going to do it. And I'm not bragging.
[58:13.480 --> 58:17.480]  So bragging is fact. It's just that I love the talents God gave me. You've got a lot
[58:17.480 --> 58:24.080]  of talents as well. YouTube doesn't have the talent of downloading my video. Hitler dog.
[58:24.080 --> 58:31.480]  There's no need to fear. Sorry. We're going to return. I do cover commander. I was kind
[58:31.480 --> 58:38.600]  of shot. That was hard to do it. Autobots transform and roll out. Bumblebee open fire. He came
[58:38.600 --> 58:45.400]  to your place in the queue to save your species. Autobots transform and roll out. This is
[58:45.400 --> 58:50.280]  CNN. Closed caption provided by Bud Atlantic. The heart of closed caption communication.
[58:50.280 --> 58:56.880]  Yeah. First of all, I want to say, Secret 12. That's two super male brain force prostagart
[58:56.880 --> 59:02.000]  silver bullet. I use them all. They're phenomenal. They work. Buy them folks. Thank you, brother.
[59:02.000 --> 59:06.800]  Thank you guys for putting those out there. I am a relatively short time listener and
[59:06.800 --> 59:12.680]  I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products. Welcome to the info war. It's so easy to get
[59:12.680 --> 59:17.320]  these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the info war at the same time.
[59:17.320 --> 59:21.560]  I'm a nine year listener. I buy all the nutraceuticals, Casio FX, uh, Nathan.
[59:21.560 --> 59:25.280]  All right. Let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you? They're the most unbelievable
[59:25.280 --> 59:30.040]  products I've ever had in my life. What products are you taking? Everything from, uh, super
[59:30.040 --> 59:36.640]  male to, uh, brain force to winter sun, uh, X two, even got a little DNA force. So when
[59:36.640 --> 59:42.080]  I just re-upped everything and I just went to auto bill visit info wars.com to read the
[59:42.080 --> 59:46.520]  information and research and to see the reviews for yourself. That's info wars, lives.com
[59:46.520 --> 01:00:16.480]  or call 888-253-3139. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. We are
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:25.120]  on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:30.200]  By the way, again, I'm a free market guy. I'm not one of these socialists. That's a shame
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:33.520]  to people writing a book or making a better car and making a bunch of money. That's free
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:37.200]  market. It makes our world better. I'm against crony capitalism, ally of the socialism.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:41.920]  But when I talked about the time, I mean, I've been paid a hundred thousand for voiceover
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:45.320]  was the second biggest I ever got paid. I never even tried to really be in voiceovers.
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:49.440]  And they wanted me to do a bunch of voiceovers for national TV shows, but you know, it wasn't
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:55.120]  shows I want to be a part of. And it was high union rates. They wanted me to do movie voiceovers.
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:59.200]  You name it. And I was just simply saying, I do this not to make money. I do this because
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:03.200]  this is where my passion is. And it takes a lot of money to run this operation. In fact,
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:09.280]  I took the 800 plus thousand dollars. I made off that voiceover money and I put it in to
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:14.320]  info wars. I took it as part of info wars money. And my accountant goes, this is separate
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:18.520]  money. Why are you putting it back into the company? Keep it. I said, I need eight hundred
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:22.680]  and fifty something thousand dollars. That, that, that runs us for like a month. Even
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:27.400]  back then, that's expensive to do media. I mean, our bandwidth costs are hundreds of
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:31.800]  thousands of months, literally the computers and all of it. And so I put it back in. That's
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:36.920]  what it's all about. But, but I have a real pleasure. And then I turned down a Hollywood
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:43.040]  career and voiceover career and everything. But man, it was stuff like they want me to
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:47.240]  play like psychotic killers and stuff. And obviously I could play a psychotic killer.
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:51.680]  Really good. Be a big, you know, big, big hit. But you know, to quote John Goodman, I'm
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:57.680]  drinking my coffee. You know, he wrote 127 episodes of branded non lightweight. Okay.
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:01.640]  I'm getting a real big Lebowski inside baseball right now. I need to stop it. We have a really
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:05.680]  important guest stuff on Maladu on the Islamic horde takeover. One of the globalists are
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:11.960]  behind it. We have a special guest joining as investigative reporter on human slave
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:17.800]  trafficking coming on Paul Watson will haunt show the fourth hour today. Before I go any
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:22.240]  further, I mentioned Hitler dog like four years ago, I did a joke video when they being
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:27.000]  in the JC Penney teapot saying you can magically see Hitler. It's like seeing, you know, Mary
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.200]  in a bagel or whatever. When I see Hitler in a bagel, you arrest whoever, you know, has
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:36.440]  the bagel. But this guy made fun of this Hitler dog as a joke. And so he's been arrested in
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:40.760]  Scotland. I guess I could be arrested for my Hitler dog video with my dog captain. Here's
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:46.640]  part of it. There is the evil teapot. And then there is my French bulldog. And I could
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:52.000]  have probably seen Hitler in a pile of dirt outside my house. But instead of sort of looking
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:58.360]  at captain, our French bulldog. And I gotta admit, I'm like a closet Nazi because I kiss
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:03.240]  him right on his Hitler mustache. That dog gets kisses from me. Okay. And for my children,
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:06.480]  they're there. They're sitting supporting Hitler and look at him. I mean, he even looks like
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:12.400]  Hitler. His eyes kind of look like Hitler. He's got no fur on his lip. And it looks
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:19.360]  like a Hitler mustache. That dog, JC Penney's banned those teapots and had them destroyed.
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:23.960]  So I'm taking captain today into the pound and I'm going to have him put him in a gas
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:28.520]  chamber and kill him like they do stray dogs. And I'm sad, but I'm going to prove that I'm
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:33.000]  not racist. And I'm going to sacrifice him on the ultra political correctness to prove
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.680]  I'm not racist and to satisfy Al Sharpton. So captain, should I give him lethal injection
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:42.680]  or give him the pressure chamber? I mean, I don't want him to feel any pain. I love
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:47.560]  the dog. But I mean, he does look like Hitler. And I realized I want to apologize. Maybe
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:54.920]  I should be gassed because I just realized I, my wife and I chose a dog when he was
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:04:01.600]  a puppy that had a Hitler mustache because of a subconscious racism. Can we put the racism
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:06.320]  back up on air? Only to illustrate it and to apologize. Ladies and gentlemen, I want
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:10.920]  to apologize. Can we show my racist dog before we added the iron cross on the helmet of
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:15.520]  the Kaiser helmet, the World War One, Phil Marshall helmet? I mean, look at him, folks.
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:23.560]  That I'm so ashamed. My dog is Hitler. In fact, it may be a genetic experiment. He may
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:29.840]  actually be Adolf Alois Hitler. Perhaps he escaped to America and is hiding out, not
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:35.200]  Argentina. No, that was they were all hiding in the CIA as a French bulldog. Ladies and
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:40.920]  gentlemen, even though the dog tag around his neck is of a bone, the Nazi scum and crossbones
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:47.000]  had a skull above a bone. Oh my gosh, he is wearing a Nazi necklace. Folks, this is just
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.920]  as bad as the teapot. Look at that little, that little bronze bell. That's, that's, that's
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:57.240]  a death said too. Well, thank God. We'll be back. We're going to repostm4s.com, a flashback
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:01.280]  of Hitler dog and tie it into the new context.
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:07.840]  Nearly one in six young men inside the U.S. are either jobless or incarcerated, reports
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:13.320]  Breitbart News. According to the Congressional Budget Office, out of 38 million young men
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:20.760]  in the U.S. in 2014, 16% were jobless or incarcerated. The share of young men without a job or in
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:27.160]  prison has increased substantially since the 1980s, when just 11% of young men fit into
[01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:33.000]  either category. CBO highlights that the level of joblessness and incarceration varies based
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.360]  on young men's educational attainment. The less they have, the more likely they are to
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:43.440]  be jobless or incarcerated. Economic, policy and skill set changes contributed to the large
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:49.680]  increase of joblessness and incarceration from 1980 to 2014. The increased incarceration
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:56.480]  rates, CBO added, is not necessarily due to an increase of crime, but again, policy decisions.

[51:41.620 --> 01:08:39.440]  coming up folks, an exclusive interview we taped with Billy Corrigan where he goes
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:43.360]  out with the social justice warriors and more. Last time he was on it was in hundreds of
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:47.520]  newspapers. They tried to attack him for pointing out that the controlled left is nothing but
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:52.600]  an authoritarian movement. They got even more hardcore in this interview, and that's
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:55.560]  going to be coming up a little bit of that in the next hour. Then we're going to premiere
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:09:01.240]  all of it in the fourth hour, 30 minutes long, with Paul Joseph Watson. The full video has
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:07.440]  already been posted to InfoWars.com with the headline, New Video. Billy Corrigan exposes
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:12.880]  the tyranny of the social justice warriors. It's also been tweeted at Real Alex Jones,
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:17.280]  and it's on our Facebook as well. And even though they've been trying to censor us on
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:22.240]  Facebook and they admit they have, people have been battling back. And so instead of
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:26.040]  a video getting a million views, they started getting like 30,000 views, people learned
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:30.360]  about it, started posting it on their own, and they're back up to a half million to a
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:35.920]  million views, many of them. So once people were aware of the control and the attack,
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:40.840]  things really reversed in the other direction. See, tyranny will crush you if you don't resist
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:46.000]  it or you're not aware of it. But if like its weights, you start squatting and deadlifting
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.160]  and bench pressing, pretty soon you walk up against a bunch of tyranny. It's like walking
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:55.720]  into the gym and you're like, high five and let's go, 600 pounds on the deadlift, baby.
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:59.840]  That which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger. And I've been covering this censorship for
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:04.200]  years with Facebook. It's been intensifying the last few months. Drudge has knocked the
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:08.680]  doors down. Now the Senate is investigating it. And they want to act like they're libertarians
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:12.120]  suddenly when he's not meeting with the communist Chinese top censors, learning how to do all
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:18.120]  this. Zuckerberg, who calls his users dumb efforts, his people are all saying, hey, it's
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:23.080]  free market. Okay, it's our property. We're allowed to. Okay, but just admit libertarians,
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:27.560]  conservatives, free thinkers of any type that are anti status, let's just say small government
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:33.200]  people are not welcome. Okay, they're not welcome. You're all green lighted in communist
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:38.040]  China because you play ball. I mean, face, there's nothing worse than Facebook when it
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:42.600]  comes to censorship other than maybe Twitter, but, but Google's big into it as well. So
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:46.480]  the good news is it's in the Hill newspaper. It's in the international business times.
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:52.320]  It's all over the news. Senate Commerce Committee launches inquiry into Facebook over trending
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:11:00.520]  topic censorship. Now, every day I've got like 10 articles or more without looking where
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:04.680]  high school teacher, middle school teacher in Austria arrested, indicted for saying that
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:08.720]  Mohammed promoted underage sex with young girls. I mean, it says that in the Korean
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:14.880]  they can go out for like 11 year olds. Okay. Now on one side, Nambla and the UN's pushing
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:19.320]  it is great. And the Saudis are over here with women as literal slaves. I go to malls
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:23.200]  in Austin. I've been going to since I was a kid and it looks like I'm in, in the middle
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:27.880]  of Saudi Arabia. I mean, literally women with full beekeeper suits that Stefan Malinu calls
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:32.960]  them around every corner. And I mean, it's like seeing slaves with chains around their
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:36.960]  necks. I was actually triggered for the first time in my life to use a leftist term. I mean,
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:40.000]  I was actually freaked out because they were, the women were looking freaked out because
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.200]  I had my daughter's whipping with her big long blonde hair and, you know, their little
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:47.240]  skirts on and they're, and they're pretty shoes and, you know, clomping around having
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:52.000]  a good time with daddy. And I mean, I don't go to Saudi Arabia for a reason. I have families
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.800]  been over there. They say it's scary. You preach the gospel, you get arrested. Now at
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:59.080]  least old fashioned atheists didn't care if Christians taught the gospel, whether you
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:04.520]  love it or hate it. The issue is we're bringing in radical Islam because they've got police
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:09.240]  chiefs and mayors all over announcing in Europe and in the UK, we're going to arrest
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:13.840]  you if you criticize Islam or the Queen or anybody else. See the left is wanting to go
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:20.160]  authoritarian now. Oh, you're a leftist. Make a joke about your dog in Hitler. I made a
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:23.480]  joke about my dog in Hitler years ago. He looks like Hitler. He's got a little Hitler
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:29.440]  mustache. Uh, you know, the teapot looks like Hitler. Oh my God, man. He was been arrested.
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:36.800]  Michael Savage can't go to England. Now hundreds of other people can. This is the tyranny,
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:42.680]  ladies and gentlemen. This is the insanity by design. And now mother, father, he's she,
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:47.280]  you can't have your identity. It hurts someone else. Now the word American is hateful, not
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:52.440]  just American flags. This is the destruction of language and somebody warning about it
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:55.240]  really longer than I've been when it comes to political correctness. I've always covered
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:59.480]  political correctness, but it was so ridiculous. I thought people never buy into it, but it's
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:06.600]  being forced from the top is Stefan Malinu free domain radio on YouTube at Twitter at
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:13.560]  Stefan Malinu M O L Y N E U X free domain radio.com. I don't need to introduce him. He's got hundreds
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:19.000]  of millions of views to his videos. A lot of fans around the world and he himself is
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  an atheist, but I respect him because he's not a hateful atheist. We can all have our
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:28.480]  own cosmologies, our own ideas to unify our field theory and whatever. But my problem
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:34.000]  is so-called leftist atheist who then make the state God. I can't stand big religion.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.480]  I can't stand establishment religion. It's totally with the state. So I agree with a
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:42.640]  lot of real atheists on that issue that that's a big threat, but I personally have a spiritual
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:47.000]  side. I have a relationship. I believe in higher power, but he respects that. The point
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.800]  is he has piercing analysis on the history. So I've done my research. He knows what he's
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:56.200]  talking about and a very witty tongue when it comes to breaking down what's really happening.
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:02.720]  You've heard me set the table here, sir on what's going on. It seems like is this a desperation
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:06.360]  because they know everybody's laughing at them. More and more real liberals like Seinfeld
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:13.360]  and John Cleese. Or is it a power trip that they're doing this? Where are we societally
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:18.920]  globally? Why would the left ally itself with the radicalist forms of Islam that's running
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:23.000]  around jihading and murdering every Muslim that doesn't put a hood over their wife's
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.480]  head and chop their genitals off? I mean, why would feminist groups be defending in
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:34.000]  the news and calling me an Islamophobe because I am offended by going into a mall and seeing
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:40.040]  50 something women all over the place with hoods over their heads, with their husbands
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:44.360]  bugging their eyes out at me and staring at my daughters. I mean, I know an aggressive
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:48.640]  alien culture. When I see it, it'd be like if we went to a time machine and brought back
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:54.120]  millions of Aztecs and they were suddenly eating people or Nazis were running around
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:59.680]  the mall in SS uniforms. If I went to Martin Creek Mall and saw 40 or 50 people in Nazi
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:04.000]  uniforms, I would be offended. I'd be freaked out. I'd be, what on earth is this? Is this
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:11.160]  some type of joke? But it's so acceptable. It's a sacrament. Is it a hatred of the West?
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:17.040]  Is it a form of cuckolding? Is it a form of human cultural sacrifice to butcher the West?
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:19.080]  Stephen Molyneux, what are we currently facing?
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:23.760]  Well, I think it's all those things and more, Alex. But just before we get started out of
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:29.520]  sympathy for your eye issues, I just wanted to mention something. See if you can recognize
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:35.680]  this quote. It's 100 miles to Chicago. We've got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes.
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:39.920]  It's dark and we're wearing sunglasses. And they made fun of Nazis. So I say, arrest
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:40.920]  the blues brothers.
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:47.160]  Yes, exactly. Well, I think they're united by a hatred of the free market. You know,
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:52.160]  what do the left and other radical ideologies all have in common is the desire to use the
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:57.720]  violence and the power of the state to interfere with people's free choices, who they trade
[01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:01.120]  with, where they go to school, where they want to live, what kind of neighbors they
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:05.680]  want to have. This is consistent through all of these ideologies. And you can see this
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:12.480]  mounting opposition growing to all of this madness where people are so bothered by other
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:18.360]  people's free choices that these busy bodies want to go in there with the guns and violence
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:24.760]  of the state and order people around because other people's choices trigger them into terrible,
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:30.720]  horrifying bouts of hysterical, fainting couch Victorian nonsense. And we just have to fight
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:36.880]  back. We have to say, look, I am going to make my choices according to my rational conscience.
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:41.760]  You make your choices according to your hopefully rational conscience. And as long as neither
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:46.680]  of us is initiating force against the other, live and let live. But that is exactly they're
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:50.760]  saying I'm censoring because I don't like hoods over women's heads. No, if they're wearing
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:54.560]  hoods and that's the issue and they want to, that's fine. But they don't even let these
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:17:00.080]  women drive. They, they are kept captured creatures, basically like the families they
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:04.640]  find that live in basements that didn't know there was an outside world. That's slavery.
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:05.960]  That's not their right.
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:12.040]  Well, here's the challenge. When I was growing up, and I think we're similar ages, but when
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:17.960]  I was growing up, the big fear and, and rightly so was communism. And communism was a world
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:24.720]  dominating ideology disguised as a theoretical economic system. Now there are theological
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:30.120]  constructs in the world right now, which the West is staring down, which are world dominating
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:35.640]  fiat theocratic systems disguised as a religion. And that is the challenge. That is the challenge.
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:39.040]  If people want to have different beliefs, that's fine. But if they're not willing to
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:43.520]  support the separation of church and state, then all people of good conscience from atheists
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:47.880]  to agnostics to Christians to fundamentalists to whoever, all who oppose the separation
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:52.640]  of church and state are going to end up stifling the kind of debate that is a necessary traction
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:54.840]  for the advancement of civilization.
[01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:59.120]  Well, that's right. I mean, that's the issue of a woman is 18 years old and she wants to
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:02.560]  go live in a basement and be chained to a wall where a hood overhead and be beaten and
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:07.000]  have acid thrown her face. She can sign waiver forms to do that under contracting. She has
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.280]  a right as an extreme libertarian. I think she has a right. People have a right to maim
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:15.040]  themselves, pour Drano in their eyes, the new sexy liberal thing. I'm not kidding, folks.
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:19.080]  If you haven't learned about this, I shouldn't have to pay for it. So let's have a sex change.
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:23.400]  Knock yourself out. I'm not paying for it. But these women are born into slavery. The
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:28.360]  dominant form of Islam is taking over our government's allied with it. Why are Western
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:32.680]  states or tell me if you disagree, Stefan Molyneux, why are they allying with it so
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:33.680]  feverishly?
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:40.160]  Well, I mean, this long and complicated set of answers to that. The one thing I will mention
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:44.400]  is that it's been fairly well shown in monkey studies, which is really the best place to
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:49.240]  go and study political motivations. A lot of apes, when they climb up the hierarchy of
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:53.080]  political power within their own particular tribe, when they gain more resources and become
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:57.280]  more alpha, they get dopamine in the brain. A dopamine is highly addictive substance within
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:01.480]  the brain. It's something that's mirrored in cocaine addiction. So people who have climbed
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:06.840]  to the top of political power are literally physical addicts to that political power.
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:10.960]  And anything which threatens that addiction is going to be viewed as a high negative to
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:15.680]  them. And of course, something has been set up where anything where white people or Western
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:20.280]  people or European people or the European derived cultures, whenever we say our culture
[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:25.640]  has great value, our history has great value, our traditions have great value. Well, that's
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:29.680]  automatically racist as if somehow you like Europe, you must inevitably hate the rest
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:33.880]  of the world or you like America, you must hate the rest of the world. So politicians
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:38.200]  view racism as something that can dislodge them from power, which takes them away from
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:43.480]  the dopamine hit of their addiction to political power. And we would not expect sensible decisions
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:48.200]  from any drug addict and politics is one of the most dangerous drugs of all.
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:52.720]  Stefan, you sent over four or five articles, you wanted to go over today. In fact, some
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:56.960]  of these articles already had my stack dealing with world developments that kind of illustrate
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:02.400]  the point we are at right now. Let's go over some of those Europe will soon have more Muslims
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:07.800]  and Christians. Belgium warns against making an enemy of Islam at Brussels attacks hearing.
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:12.560]  But they're here bullying us. My guys were in France and Belgium. They were no go bullied
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:18.200]  everywhere. Joe Biggs was in Afghanistan, Iraq, never experienced something like this.
[01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:23.600]  London's iconic red buses declared glory to Allah. Police unleashed tear gas for massive
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:30.320]  migrant brawl erupts in Paris train station. A Soros fierce collapse of EU due to refugee
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:34.760]  crisis, which they brought in Europe refugee system and chaos. They want to find folks
[01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:38.840]  a quarter million euros for each immigrant. They don't let in including people with terrorist
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:45.080]  backgrounds. UK's equality chief who populized the term Islamophobia admits, I thought Muslims
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:48.520]  would blend into Britain. I should have known better. Well, these are the useful idiots.
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:52.880]  There's a larger master plan. Let's walk through it.
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:59.840]  Well, of course, the idea that everybody values diversity is false. Even if we say diversity
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:04.200]  or multiculturalism is a value in society, and that is certainly arguable based upon
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:09.400]  the data, Alex. But even if we say it's some magical, wonderful value for there to be multiculturalism
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:16.080]  and diversity within a country. Well, those groups that come in who don't value multiculturalism
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:21.480]  and diversity won't blend. This is not that this is not really complicated.
[01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:23.840]  Why won't Japan let Muslims in?
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:28.320]  Well, because Japan wants to say Japanese. And why is it that nobody gets that angry
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:33.640]  that Japan or China or Hong Kong are not letting Muslims in? Why didn't people get angry that
[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:40.120]  Saudi Arabia is not letting Muslims in? Because those countries don't suffer from the self
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:46.000]  hating pathological white guilt that is used and has been used to strip mine resources
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:51.240]  from European and European derived cultures for the past 50 years. White people feel guilty.
[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:55.960]  Oh, you're a racist. Oh, I don't want to be a racist here. Here's my entire country to
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:22:00.080]  prove that I'm not a racist. Here's my entire culture. I'm going to open all the borders.
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:05.680]  I'm going to surrender to this massive union of church and state known as Islam, just because
[01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:10.480]  I don't want to be called a racist. And people in the West do not have the right to sell
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:13.880]  their freedoms for the sake of political correctness. The freedoms that our ancestors
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:19.200]  fought and bled and died for, we do not have the right to give that away. That which you
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:23.680]  create, you cannot hand away or destroy. And we have all inherited these freedoms in the
[01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:27.960]  West and we should be guarding them fiercely with as much emotional and intellectual energy
[01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:33.920]  as we can and not handing it away because we're scared of words.
[01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:38.800]  I asked you earlier, you started to get into it. Why do you think it seems like it's doubled
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:43.000]  or tripled in the absurdity just the last year? And then almost every month, it seems
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:48.840]  to be compounding to levels of sheer lunacy. But on the campuses, on the government facilities,
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:54.360]  no amount of ridiculousness from banning brown paper bags to the word mother and father.
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:59.800]  It's just, it's all like a religion. And so many people I know that call themselves leftist
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:05.720]  are just totally embracing it to the point now of if you say to someone on the street,
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:10.160]  let's go eat Mexican food. A white person will say to you, that's racist. You go, excuse
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:14.240]  me. And they go, don't say the word Mexican. And then literally I was debating it. I show
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:17.840]  it to people and this Hispanic lady goes, no, that's like you say Chinese food, or let's
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:22.080]  go eat soul food. It's not racist. I mean, the Hispanic people aren't the ones even
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:29.040]  pushing it. It's this weird, like witch hunt, white, middle illness, you know, freak show.
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:34.560]  I don't know. It's crazy, man. Well, it's all designed. You know, what does, what does
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:39.680]  a particularly venomous animal do when it wants to bring you down, but it's smaller? Well,
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:44.000]  it bites you and injects the paralysis and then it can feast on you at its leisure. And
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.520]  I think the reality is basically that the left is trying to paralyze and stifle all
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:52.640]  debate about anything sensible. People say, oh, let's have an honest conversation about
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:56.400]  race. So let's have an honest conversation about incompatible religious beliefs, but
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:00.880]  it's not an honest conversation unless you're, you know, white and feel bad and well said,
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:05.360]  they're just ending debate. They're stifling, putting out, you know, a smoke screen. When
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:08.600]  you talk about Islam not being compatible, there's this debate. Is it radical Islam or
[01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:12.720]  is it Islam? Whatever it is I've studied history, the radical form of it is taking over and
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:16.640]  getting more radical. They kill each other everywhere they are. These Wahhabist. Why
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:21.480]  is the West allying with it? And what is political Islam? Where is it going? What do you expect
[01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:24.120]  to happen next, Stefan?
[01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:29.200]  Well it's going to go one of two ways. And I don't like to predict because that has an
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:33.600]  air of deterministic inevitability to it. It's going to go one of two ways, Alex. And
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:37.520]  I think that you and I and the other freedom minded people are all on the same battalion
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:41.880]  as far as this goes. It's going to go one of two ways. Either we are going to rediscover
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:47.600]  the value and civilization and liberties of the West and defend them strongly and oppose
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:53.600]  ideologies that seek to quench those and squelch those underfoot or they're going to win. You
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:58.000]  know, in any conflict between two groups, the most consistent group will always win.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.000]  And the people who want to undo the freedoms of the West have been very consistent and
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.520]  very dedicated for decades. And you know, there's an old saying that civilization rises
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:10.960]  in hobnail boots and descends in silk slippers. You know, maybe we all just got a little lazy.
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:13.800]  We just took all these freedoms for granted and assumed they were going to stick around
[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:18.480]  like the laws of physics. Well, they don't. Everything that is good in this world erodes
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:24.200]  without strong rehabilitation and reinforcement. And we've just kind of gotten lazy. We're crossing
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:27.960]  our fingers. You know, there's studies that show that second and third generation Muslims
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:32.080]  in England are more radicalized than their parents. It's not only that they're not integrating.
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:37.440]  They're actually going in the opposite direction. And where does this lead? This idea that we
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:42.720]  can buy five more minutes piece from the verbal abuse of being called a racist or an Islamophobe
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:48.080]  as if as if Islam is even a race. That's like being called a racist for criticizing communism.
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:52.160]  We all focused on this idea that we can get five more minutes piece and they'll just leave
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:58.440]  us alone for five more minutes. That has never, ever ended well in human history to my knowledge.
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:03.000]  That's right. And communism was funded by some of the criminal elements in the West has now
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.240]  been declassified to create a big enemy to fight with. And the PNAC documents Dick Cheney
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:11.040]  writes, we're going to radicalize Islam, stir them up and then have this hundred year
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:15.600]  Americana reign off fighting them. Well, I said that was a moral and evil. But what's
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:20.040]  even more evil is to actually make a deal and say, no, you're going to be the new culture
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:25.440]  and then overrun everything that's created such incredible liberal freedom for everybody
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:29.800]  because I'm a real liberal. I mean, you know, I mean, we get down to brass tacks. I'm into
[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:32.760]  people having their own freedoms. I mean, I have some of my own, you know, conservative
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:36.960]  views how I want to live, but I'm liberal when I say, Hey, I'm very tolerant. Hey, I'm
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:41.080]  not trying to run your life, but they want to run my life. So there's such control freaks.
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:46.600]  They want to ally with it when it's never going to ally with them. So is this a double
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:52.600]  cross of Islam, a setup, a class of civilizations or what's really happening, Stefan?
[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:57.040]  Well, there are, of course, decent Muslims in the West who came to the West because
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:00.400]  they didn't like living in Muslim countries and they wanted to be able to practice their
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:05.080]  faith free of Sharia law and some of the brutal enforcements that occur in Islamic
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:07.800]  America. But this is a reformation. These people are seen as heretics.
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:12.720]  Oh, absolutely. But see, those of us in the West who value freedoms don't have the right
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:16.480]  to sell the freedoms that the Muslims who've come to the West to escape Sharia law. We
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:20.160]  would not have the right to sell their freedoms off either. What needs to happen in the West,
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:23.960]  and of course, this is something in my opinion, as Donald Trump has talked about it as well,
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:30.200]  is that immigration as a whole has been going completely haywire for 50 or 60 years, basically
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:35.960]  since the 65 Act under Kennedy, which shifted, in particular, in America, immigration from
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:42.200]  Europe, which is America's traditional feeding stock for immigration, to third world countries.
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:47.640]  And what's happened is now they've got a huge number of incompatible cultures coming
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:52.440]  in and that's fine if you have a small number and you give them time to assimilate and integrate
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:54.560]  and find out if the experiment is going to...
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:57.400]  And if you don't give them welfare and put them in public schools, brainwashing them
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:02.680]  into race groups. Well, that's key as well. I'm for the free movement of people, but you
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:07.320]  can either have open borders or you can have a welfare estate. You can't have both.
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:10.720]  Exactly. You can't have a free lunch and not put a wall around it.
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:15.240]  Well, I think that's fair. And if we look at what's going on, this question that's coming
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:21.280]  up soon, right, which is the Brexit question, whether England should continue to lash itself
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:24.600]  to the decisions of the all wise, all powerful bureaucrats...
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:28.360]  Let's define this. Talk about how the EU operates. We'll go to break and talk about Brexit.
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:33.560]  This is so big. I want to kind of shoot a flare up on this or embolden this with highlighter,
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:38.440]  you know, yellow marker with Stefan Malinu joining us from freedomainradio.com because
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:43.000]  this is the big issue. Globalism is in crisis. You're answering the question now. It's being
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.480]  reversed, which is why it's pushing authoritarianism. Spend a minute as we go to break on how the
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:49.760]  euro operates.
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:54.200]  Well, the euro is the outgrowth of the fantasy that a lot of globalists and a lot of the
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:59.040]  elites and a lot of the socialists and communists have. And the fantasy is, Alex, well, we are
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:04.160]  just one additional bureaucratic government coercive layer away from paradise, you know,
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:10.680]  four more regulations and we achieve nirvana in the West. And this is a complete disaster.
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:15.640]  And all of these additional layers of bureaucracy, all of this distancing of power from the voters
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:19.560]  and the taxpayers has produced all of the same disasters that we would expect from something
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:24.320]  like the USSR, which collapsed of its own overhead, stay there. Let's talk about a tax exempt
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:29.560]  above the law, unelected bureaucracy, permanent government, follow everything in the Declaration
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:34.160]  of Independence on steroids. Stefan Malinu, an amazing brain is our guest. He's with us
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:38.640]  till five after next hour with your questions for Stefan Malinu or comments. We'd like to
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:43.480]  hear from you on radical Islam that is Islam. Now, how do we deal with it? Well, our governments
[01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:47.440]  have run up the white flag. They love the authoritarianism and want to marry it. Well,
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:50.760]  for our dead bodies, stay with us. I'll get the number out when we come back. We're on
[01:29:50.760 --> 01:30:19.160]  the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Joe Binks here
[01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:26.040]  in Benghazi. Hello? Hey, your vote will decide who answers that call. Bob, what time is it?
[01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:31.440]  Oh, three a.m. Whether it's someone who already knows the world's leaders, knows the military,
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:35.440]  someone tested and ready to lead in a dangerous war. Oh, cool. She should answer. She said
[01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:40.640]  she would. Hello. We're under attack. The building's on fire. They're shooting at us.
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:46.120]  There's explosion. We're the f***ing guard who said you were going to answer. Come on,

[01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:28.760]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones. Monday through Friday from
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:32.960]  11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central, we're broadcasting World Wide. Paul Watson will host the fourth
[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:39.120]  hour from London, London stand. And we're going to be airing the Billy Corgan interview
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:44.560]  then, a new never-before-seen or heard interview. It's now up on infowars.com and going viral.
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:49.480]  And it's good because he's seen as kind of a mainline intellectual in the past, liberal.
[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:53.680]  But he's really just a free thinker and it really freaks out the establishment when
[01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:57.800]  he comes out to his tens of millions of fans. And they try to intimidate music people. They
[01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:01.120]  try to make them shut up. Hollywood folks as well. But more and more are saying we're
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:05.680]  not liberal or we're not conservative. We're Renaissance. We're pro-human. We're pro-freedom.
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:10.120]  Call it whatever you want. We're sick of the totalitarianism of the left and the right.
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:13.400]  We're saying no. We'll go back to Stefan Malinou. Here in just a moment, the toll-free number
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:17.680]  to join us on air with your question or comment for Stefan Malinou, I'm your host, Alex Jones,
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:26.200]  is 800-259-9231. 800-2599-231. Ladies and gentlemen, we believe we've developed the
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:29.720]  very best vitamin mineral fusion out there. That's why it's called vitamin mineral fusion.
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:34.360]  It does just have all the vitamins and minerals. It has amazing amino acids that help your
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:39.120]  body actually download it. It doesn't have any unnatural flavors or colors. It is fruit
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:43.520]  punch flavored. It is amazing. It's flavored by the vitamins and minerals that are in it.
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:47.720]  It's incredible. Like take vitamin B12. It's a great flavor, a methylcobalamin. It's so
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:53.400]  good and it is concentrated. So it's one little scoop, makes like three big glasses
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:58.200]  or more. Two scoops makes a whole pitcher. And this is what my children drink instead
[01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:04.240]  of the garbage that's out there that's artificially sweetened. It's been sold out since the first
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:10.560]  run came in. It's got almost five star reviews. M4warslife.com, a big shipment came in. Try
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:15.680]  some of it today. Give it as a gift, especially to older folks that are trying to take multivitamins
[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:20.360]  where the gut doesn't absorb it. It's such an absorption problem. When something's liquid,
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:26.920]  it absorbs a lot better. There's much better absorption. M4warslife.com. We also have anthroplex,
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:31.400]  a lot of known herbs to help boost your body's own hormone output and make you so it's changed
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:37.400]  my life. I've lost so much weight. I have so much more health. Also, we have the special
[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:41.840]  on the food that was so popular. We ran for a week and a half. It's back, but on the top
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:46.600]  four best sellers. This is insurance you can eat. The globalists want us to stabilize.
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:50.040]  They want us dependent. They're bringing us into a world of depression. They're starting
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:54.160]  all these wars. Leads are getting armored redouts, historical foods, sort of police departments.
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:58.520]  That's all in the news. I'm not saying all this is going to happen, but it's something
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:03.960]  in case things unravel that you need to take care of yourself, your friends, your family,
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:09.760]  and others. So M4warsstore.com is the big umbrella site where you can find the M4wars select
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:13.360]  storeable food. That's the entire family of my Patriot. We have the full selection of
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:17.800]  my Patriot. Already it's a great deal as well, but on the top four best sellers of M4wars
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:22.000]  select, I can go even lower because it's private labeled. Now is the time to not procrastinate
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:25.880]  and get your storeable food today. Plus, the profit we make funds this operation. When
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:29.280]  I talk about what I've done in some Hollywood movies, when I got invited to be in them or
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:33.760]  when I did voiceovers nationally, and I took the profits that I had from that, put it right
[01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:39.720]  back into M4wars and building this operation because nothing wrong with making money. Nothing
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:45.920]  wrong with being secure and being self-sufficient. But for me, it's about securing intellectual
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:51.160]  freedom and freedom of assembly and freedom of association and freedom of men and women
[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:55.480]  to live like they want as long as they don't hurt somebody else. And that's all fundamentally
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:37:01.360]  under attack by radical Islam. And you see the West again, Stefan, you wanted to get
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:05.160]  into these Muslim police chiefs in Europe, arresting people, but also mainline green
[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:10.560]  parties, even worse, allied with them, the new Muslim mayor saying, we don't need quote
[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:15.840]  uncle Tom Muslims. We need radicals. And this is, this is what's pushed. And I've been in
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:20.920]  London a lot just as I was, I've been in London like five or six times, but when I went, went
[01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:29.200]  there in 2005 for the first time to cover the London bombing, which had been provocateur.
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:34.000]  And I was there. The Muslims weren't as aggressive and mean, but I've been there like four or
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.480]  five times after. They're very aggressive and getting a lot of folks's face. And when
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:42.800]  you get to the airport, you know the price it's supposed to be your hotel. And they,
[01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:47.560]  and they'll all get together and go, no, triple. And then you've got to wait. I'm sorry till
[01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:51.680]  somebody from the UK shows up and they go, no, I know it's horrible. It's illegal. They're
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:56.680]  not supposed to do that, but they do that because they hate Westerners so much. And it's just
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:38:01.040]  when people are hating you and you've been taught to be liberal and to spread your legs
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:05.120]  metaphysically and culturally to it. And that doesn't even please them. It only makes
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:08.320]  them know you're weak. You're here to roll over. And they come from countries where they're
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:12.760]  killing each other and can't even get civilization. It's just like, what is the elite thinking
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:19.600]  Stefan? Well, there's always the, at least to me, the implied and implicit threat, right?
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:25.680]  So what a day or two after Sadiq Khan became the Muslim mayor of London. He tweeted out,
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:30.520]  said Trump's ignorant view of Islam could make both our countries less safe. It risks
[01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:36.600]  alienating mainstream Muslims. Well, that's sort of like, you know, nice little democracy
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:39.840]  you got going on here, be a real shame if something happened to it, like if it caught
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:44.360]  fire or something. I mean, it's terrible stuff. I mean, this idea that, and this is not just
[01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:48.280]  with Islam, this is throughout the left and the green movement as well, who have some
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:52.600]  prominent people in the green movement are all for massive human depopulation. They've
[01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:58.440]  talked about criminal charges against people who are skeptical of the mad hatter pseudo
[01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:04.360]  science of global warming. And this idea that people who disagree with you should end up
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:09.800]  in jail is so fundamentally against the Western tradition of free speech goes all the way
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:14.840]  back to John Milton with Ariya Pajitika, who made the case that the best cure for bad ideas
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:19.160]  is public exposure. If people have bad ideas, offensive ideas, let's get them out into the
[01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:23.600]  open. Let's have them debate because they assumed people have the rational critical
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:27.640]  thinking skills to separate good arguments from bad arguments. But one of the fundamental
[01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:31.640]  problems, Alex, as you know, that's happened in the West is government schools have gotten
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:36.920]  worse and worse and worse. And now a lot of people, I think particularly the elites,
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:42.480]  no longer trust the average person in the West to be able to distinguish a good argument
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:48.400]  from a bad argument, facts from fantasies, empiricism from nonsense. And therefore, because
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:52.920]  you don't trust the people to know a good idea from a bad idea, you have to control
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:57.360]  what the people have access to. And we see this happening all over. You know, the leftist
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:02.760]  though, we're so into diversity, boy, diversity and multiculturalism is so great. Yeah. When
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:08.160]  was the last time the New York Times put an ad out saying we need a libertarian or a Republican
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:12.600]  on our editorial page because we're all leftists. So we really want to branch out. When was
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:17.280]  the last time academia said, we really want to hire someone in the social sciences. Let's
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:22.640]  make sure that they're into some libertarian or Republican philosophy. They don't. They
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:27.280]  don't. And that's so fundamental. The left has no interest in diversity whatsoever. What
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:32.280]  they do want to do is bring incompatible cultures together so that they control people who
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:35.680]  say, I don't know that this experiment is going to work really well. And they can say,
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:40.280]  ah, you're a racist. You're a biggage. And that's the way that they can also referee.
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:45.800]  They can referee the ensuing crisis that comes out of it. Yeah. It's all about. We said taking
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:48.920]  five or six things, you know, we're going to explode and going, you need to buy bomb
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:54.560]  insurance blows up. See, I told you. Well, so let's let's take the refugee that that's
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:59.360]  the big crisis. We started talking about the EU. There are two problems that the European
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:03.840]  Union has had to deal with that are the most important, I think. Number one was the financial
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:08.320]  crisis. And the financial crisis basically came about because Germany, by being a relatively
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:12.320]  responsible country, had very low interest rates because it didn't have a very high debt
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:17.520]  to GDP ratio. And a lot of the other countries, yes, I'm looking at the pigs, right? Portugal,
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:21.520]  Ireland, Greece and Spain and so on. A lot of the other countries who had bad interest
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:26.000]  rates wanted to hook into German interest rates so they could borrow at a lower rate.
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:30.440]  Sure. I mean, if I'm an irresponsible spendthrift and you're a responsible person, I want us
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:34.400]  to split the difference in our interest rates. That hurts you, but benefits me. And so the
[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:40.480]  EU extended after Greece in particular used Goldman Sachs to lie and falsify its records
[01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:45.200]  in order to get into the EU. These countries that had bad spending habits hooked into more
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:50.960]  responsible countries interest rates and blew themselves up in an orgy of fiat currency spending.
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:56.480]  And then when they ran out of money and the crap hit the fan, they started threatening
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:42:01.600]  Europe with bailouts. And in particular, Greece threatened Europe with flooding it with third
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:06.480]  world migrants unless they paid up. And if that's not a mafia style shakedown, I don't
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:09.320]  know, this should have come from Italy. If that's not a mafia style shakedown, I don't
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:14.880]  know what is. So the financial crisis led to the migrant crisis and it's all turning
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:20.720]  into a complete disaster. And that which was supposed to unify and solve most of the problems
[01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:24.960]  in Europe has now turned into the sort of downed keys that is actually hanging right
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:30.520]  over the neck of European civilization, which has survived for thousands of years, but might
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:36.160]  not be able to survive the collectivism of Brussels.
[01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:38.880]  Continue before we go to calls. I know you've got a lot of angles, a lot of points. I've
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:42.520]  kind of been bringing up some of my own questions here, Stefan, but what are some of the other
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:46.120]  angles you want to alert people to?
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:51.480]  Well, there's this idea in Europe in the EU. Sorry, I was waiting for your big speech.
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:55.880]  I'm shocked that it came back to me, but I can do it. I can hang it. So in the EU, there's
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:43:01.920]  this idea that if you want to have free trade, somehow that involves universal citizenship.
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:06.960]  There's no other country in the world that I know of that pursues this at least as strongly
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:11.080]  as the EU does. You know, I order something from China and I open it up. I don't get a
[01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:16.960]  Chinese passport in there as well. Free trade and the unfettered movement of people is something
[01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:22.120]  that is in no way related. And trying to unite these two has been a complete disaster. Of
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:29.480]  course, also in the refugee situation, according to the European statues, the refugee, if they're
[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:34.920]  genuinely an asylum seeker or fleeing war, they must stay in the first country they land
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:38.840]  in. They're not allowed to go welfare shopping as substantial proportions of them do, which
[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:43.520]  is why they want to get, say to Germany, which has a very strong welfare state and away from
[01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:47.520]  Italy, which is much more restrictive and doesn't take as many asylum applications.
[01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:52.080]  So a basic rule is you've got to stay in the first country that you land in. And that has
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:57.600]  been almost nowhere enforced in the euro. There are so many other restrictions that
[01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:00.800]  the euro is supposed to put in its member states like your debt to GDP is supposed to
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:06.280]  stay low. Many countries have blown past that with no repercussions, no ramifications whatsoever.
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:10.680]  So when England is thinking of leaving the EU, I would ask the British people, what is
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:15.360]  the EU? Is it a set of rules? Well, if those rules aren't enforced, can it even be said
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:21.720]  to exist? It is a massive pension, fattening scheme for the useless, loathsome, spotty behind
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:22.720]  bureaucrats that in fact.
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:26.720]  That's right. And you got interrupted by the break getting into the type of tyranny that
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:30.760]  the EU is involved in. I mean, the UK and most of their countries never voted to enter
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:36.080]  it. They're in it. It makes most of your laws and that it threatens giant quarter million
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:43.120]  euro pound fines if you don't accept whoever they say and even try to vet them. I mean,
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:46.600]  it's like, we're all powerful. Take these people. We're going to find you. You never
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:51.240]  voted to enter us and we rule you now. It's so dictatorial. And the fact that the bridge
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:53.160]  that's happening is so exciting.
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:45:00.040]  Okay. So if you're a British business, right, small to medium sized business, about 5% of
[01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:06.320]  those businesses in the UK trade with the EU, but 100% of those businesses are subject
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:11.080]  to the endless conveyor belt of tiny print, two point squint or vision regulations coming
[01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:18.480]  out of Brussels. Since 2010, the EU has introduced over 3,500 new laws affecting British business.
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:22.080]  Now, if you're a giant corporation, while you have a big legal department, you can do
[01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:26.320]  your regulatory capture and get the ear of the bureaucrats and offer them whatever incentives
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:30.800]  you could. So big companies, they don't mind it so much, but it's the small to medium sized
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:36.100]  companies that end up being drowned, literally drowned under this deluge of regulations.
[01:45:36.100 --> 01:45:41.480]  When Britain first joined the EU, it had 20% of the votes. Now it's down below 10%. There
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:46.560]  are hundreds of new laws and regulations that the British MPs strongly oppose, which get
[01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:48.080]  passed anyway.
[01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:53.360]  England has given away its sovereignty. That is such an astonishing thing. The British
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:58.480]  pound is one of the few fiat or semi fiat currencies that has survived for 400 years.
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:02.600]  British sovereignty as an island, I grew up in England, was something that was considered
[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:07.200]  to be one of the greatest treasures that God nature and geography had provided a civilized
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:12.440]  race. And the idea that in a decade or two, England would have given away its sovereignty
[01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:17.560]  to unelected, unaccountable people in Brussels. They suffer no negative consequences for their
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:21.760]  unbelievably terrible decisions. The idea that you would seed sovereignty to faceless
[01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:26.640]  bureaucrats in another country is unbelievably astonishing to me. And as soon as the British
[01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:33.560]  people wake up to what's happening, the vote that's coming up should be a no brainer.
[01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:37.160]  For the average low level leftist, I think a lot of them are just an occult and they
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:42.640]  just follow whatever the latest trendy directives are. And they're kind of scared. I've talked
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:46.800]  a lot of them and no political correctness is getting really weird. But still, they really
[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:51.160]  think that if they don't go along with it, they'll get in trouble. It's all just intimidation.
[01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:55.000]  They should just get off the cult. They should leave the reservation.
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:03.200]  Well look, if I say my arguments are good, otherwise shadowy, unknown, apocalyptic disaster
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:06.440]  occurs, that's usually an indication that my arguments aren't really good. Like I don't
[01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:10.080]  need to say to you, Alex, you know, two and two make four. And if you don't believe me,
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:12.600]  your studio is going to collapse, right? I mean, if I have a good argument, I have a
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:17.520]  good argument. You've got David Cameron now going around saying if England leaves the
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:24.600]  EU, war across Europe, conflagrations, destructions, genocides, I mean, this is apocalyptic, this
[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:30.160]  Pascal's wager, massive disasters occur if you don't obey my particular political opinion.
[01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:34.640]  This is all madness. And this is another example of how one government program which fails
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:38.960]  is supposed to lead to another one. Wasn't the agency or the group that was supposed
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:44.240]  to keep European peace called NATO? And hasn't that done a pretty good job since the Second
[01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:48.080]  World War of keeping European peace along, of course, with mutually assured destruction
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:53.400]  and the spread of the free market to some degree. But the idea that now if England leaves
[01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:59.440]  the EU, there will be war. I mean, this has become completely lunatic. In other words,
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:06.000]  if there are borders, there are wars. Well, that's insane. When countries tend to blend
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:09.920]  together that don't fit, that's when the greatest conflict occurs. If you look at what happened
[01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:15.960]  in Bosnia and Serbia, they want war. They want consolidation. That's why they're creating
[01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:20.440]  order out of chaos, which gives them more power and more control. I don't see this going
[01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:24.960]  well for them. The bricks exit the bricks that all of this, I think signals the death
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:29.240]  of globalism. And something like Donald Trump comes along as his globalism is bad. It's
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:34.720]  a one sided deal. And then they get so angry at him and try to say he's a racist. It just
[01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:43.360]  shows that it's a military brainwashing system. Well, I mean, Donald Trump's, frankly, in
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:48.040]  my view, magnificent foreign speech policy, where he said that America was going to withdraw
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:52.680]  from the idea of nation building. Nation building got an unfairly good reputation after the
[01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:58.800]  Second World War, after the massive bombings in Germany. And in Japan, those cultures reformulated
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:03.560]  themselves from, you know, pretty fascistic and psychotic, warmongering lunatic cultures
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:09.600]  to relatively peaceful, relatively secular free market democracies. Now that, you know,
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:13.040]  this has the whole thing to do with the average IQ of nations. You know, if you blow up Germany
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:17.200]  and you blow up Japan, really smart people go, well, that's a really, really bad thing.
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:20.960]  And therefore they end up reconstituting their societies along more peaceful and I dare say
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:26.200]  Western lines. However, there are people or groups that if you dismantle their existing
[01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:33.560]  societies, you don't get post world war to Japan and you don't get post world war to
[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:34.560]  Germany.
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:35.560]  You generate even worse.
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:38.960]  You get ISIS. Yeah, you get ISIS. Some people when bad things happen to them, they make
[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:43.440]  better decisions. Other people when bad things happen to them, well, they just make worse
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:48.160]  and worse decisions. And again, I've talked about ethnicity and IQ and people can just
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:51.360]  look up IQ around the world. There may be some reasons for this. I don't know. Nobody
[01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:55.160]  knows the exact reasons for it, but it's not a bad place to start. So the idea that Donald
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:59.240]  Trump is saying America's foreign policy is going to be determined by that, which is good
[01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:04.720]  for America, rather than these globalist fantasies of walking around the world like
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:10.560]  some iron clad iron man Julius Caesar waving your magic wand of violence to create paradise.
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:15.240]  My God, that's taken too long for America to take that perspective back. And I hope
[01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:16.640]  that he follows through on it.
[01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:20.440]  Well, all the nuclear weapons and things we've got, we've got to stop having these wars.
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:24.480]  And all I know is globalists claim globalism is going to stop war. All it's doing is starting
[01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:25.840]  more war.
[01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:30.000]  Well, but you know, the other thing, and I said this many years ago, another thing I
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:35.240]  think that's important, Alex, I think it's hard to look at Western politics at the moment
[01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:39.480]  without understanding the basic fact that the governments are out of money. And when
[01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:42.200]  you're out of money, you provoke a war. That's what always happens.
[01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:45.680]  That's right. Steffan, stay there. We're going to be back with more of these important topics

[01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:19.320]  Steph, I'm all in this with us for six more minutes in this segment. Five more in the
[01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:25.040]  next, and he's gone. We've got an expert coming on. A journalist on white slavery going on
[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:27.640]  worldwide. And every time I say that, ignorant people go, why don't you hear about black
[01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:32.400]  slavery? White slavery, sex slavery, folks, okay, and children. So that's coming up very,
[01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:35.720]  very important. It's worse than it's ever been. Islam all over the world is running
[01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:41.040]  it in like eight, nine countries still have it legal, but that's okay. I'm the problem
[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:44.880]  because I think everybody should have equal freedom. It's crazy. I want to go to John
[01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:50.840]  and a few other callers. Steph Vaughn wants to get into the left and leftist atheism as
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:55.400]  well. I know he's an expert on that, but briefly, real fast. John, in California, you're on
[01:54:55.400 --> 01:54:57.920]  the air with Steph Vaughn Maladu at freedomainradio.com.
[01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:03.840]  Thanks, guys. Good to talk to you. I have a question about the recent administration's
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:08.960]  decision to start cooperating with Iran and the negotiations that are sometimes somehow
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:13.560]  easing relations with the country. Is this a stand down like they did with Libya, or
[01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:15.920]  is there some other sort of game plan that's going on?
[01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:19.880]  Sure. I don't want to go over with Iran, but, and so I say leave them alone, but it is a
[01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:23.560]  one sided, weird deal. There's something going on behind it. Steph Vaughn, you're a smart
[01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:26.360]  guy. What do you think is going on?
[01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:30.760]  Well, it is, of course, the history of Americans' relationship with Iran is long and complex
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:37.720]  and generally does not look that great for America. I think that in order to understand
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:41.720]  what it's like to deal with Islamic countries and Islamic fundamentalists, you simply need
[01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:46.960]  to understand the life of Muhammad and you need to read your Quran. And Islam, like a
[01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:52.600]  lot of ideologies in the world, creates an us versus them mentality. Those within the
[01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:57.360]  group are good. Those who are on the outside of the group are not good. And your moral
[01:55:57.360 --> 01:56:01.280]  obligations, this is one of the problems I have with atheists and one of the huge amounts
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:06.040]  of respects that I have for Christianity. Christianity has a universal ethical standard.
[01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:10.560]  Do unto others as you would have them do unto you, not do unto other Christians, but do
[01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:15.840]  unto others as a whole. And you have to be wary when you're dealing with philosophies
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:21.680]  that say, I have no moral obligations that extend beyond my own particular group. Those
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:25.200]  are very slippery and dangerous people to try and get into deals with because you don't
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:26.200]  have the public.
[01:56:26.200 --> 01:56:30.160]  Sure. Well, it creates like an artificial psychopathic or sociopath position where this
[01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:33.480]  isn't a human, you've dehumanized them, you know, like the Nazis or whatever, or you're
[01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:36.080]  not a communist, I'm going to kill you, you're not a Muslim, I'm going to kill you, you're
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:39.280]  not a radical enough Muslim, I'm going to kill you. It's an excuse to run wild. That's
[01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:45.280]  a great question segue into your point on leftist atheists. What's your view on them?
[01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:49.680]  Well, the question is, why has everything become so hysterical and coercive and verbally
[01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:55.680]  abusive with people getting arrested for talking about various factual things about other ideologies?
[01:56:55.680 --> 01:57:00.200]  I think one of the fundamental reasons is that atheists as a whole have hacked at the
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:05.320]  idea of a personal conscience. Christianity, one of the great glories of Christianity is
[01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:10.120]  the degree to which it encourages people to be good and internalizes the standards of
[01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:13.840]  virtue so that people pursue virtue for the sake of being closer to God, for the sake
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:18.680]  of getting into heaven and so on. It internalizes the conscience. When atheism came along
[01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:23.840]  and said, well, to heck with Christianity, they also said to some degree to heck with
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:28.120]  the foundation and structure and support. That's right. They say we're animals and just
[01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:32.000]  programmable, but well, then I'm just programmed by the government. I mean, that's not true.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:38.200]  I do have free will. I am innate. I can create. I mean, it's almost like saying atheists don't
[01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:41.440]  want to believe that humans could do incredible stuff. I'm saying we're made in the image
[01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:46.360]  of God. We can do amazing things. I like that superhero aspect. They're saying, no, no, you're
[01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:49.480]  just nothing. Decisions have already been made for you. And it seems like a kind of
[01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:53.520]  an ant hill type cult or something is another religion.
[01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:58.640]  Well, society has got to be organized in some fashion. I mean, we have to organize society
[01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:01.240]  and you can say, well, we're going to get rid of the conscience. We're going to get rid
[01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:05.800]  of the Christian fealty to virtue. But what do you replace it with? And I would argue
[01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:11.160]  and have argued in a recent series of videos that what state what what atheists replace
[01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:15.880]  the Christian conscience with is the edicts of state power. I call them statheists because
[01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:20.400]  they're atheists and that they don't believe in what they consider one irrational authority.
[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:24.400]  But they replace it with a far more dangerous irrational authority called the state. You
[01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:28.440]  can be religious. I cannot be religious. We can both live peacefully side by side. But
[01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:32.640]  if you believe that the state should organize my life, we're going to come into conflict.
[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:36.000]  That's right. So really, that's why the radical left and atheists are now outlying with Islam
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:41.520]  so much. This is another authoritarian state worshiping death cult. We'll be back. I mean,
[01:58:41.520 --> 01:58:45.600]  anything can turn into a cult folks. We have one more statement with Stefan Malinu. Powerful
[01:58:45.600 --> 01:58:48.440]  points he's making. Very thought provoking. Stay with us.

[01:59:53.280 --> 01:59:55.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:08.080]  Angela Merkel is going to be attending Bilderberg this year in Deutschland.
[02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:13.440]  Our reporters will be there covering it Rob do and others. I'm even talking. I'm even thinking
[02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:21.120]  about jumping on a plane raging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:32.960]  front lines of the info war. I don't want to be in your Islamic caliphate.
[02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:38.960]  Understand hell and the arrogance of these Muslim police chiefs and Muslim mayors now
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:42.960]  saying hey we're taking over. Hey we're gonna we're gonna get aggressive.
[02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:51.920]  It's really sad because the West doesn't need to commit suicide. Stefan Malinu
[02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:56.320]  is our guest. I'm wearing sunglasses today as I cut my eye a few days ago with some sand
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:00.640]  or grit that got in and swimming in a creek and a little infected so I can't really look
[02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:04.880]  into the light too good so I've got glasses on. I'm not trying to act like the blues brothers.
[02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:11.600]  I'm not that cool. Let's take a call from the great north from John in Canada. John go ahead
[02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:16.480]  and make your point. Yeah good day Alex. Good day Steph.
[02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:25.360]  Right now in Canada I see a lot of Syrian refugees coming in. They decide to take Muslims
[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:32.880]  over presidents over the cops communities. I'm of that so I've worked on on Syrian issues before
[02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:39.360]  and I'm just wondering what can we do now that we've been given this big blank
[02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:45.280]  muffin to chew on. You know we don't want to alienate the good guys to have them
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:52.720]  become radicalized later. Like I'm sure that's excuse bring a bunch in from radical areas be
[02:01:52.720 --> 02:01:56.880]  nice to them so they're not radical. Steph was covering that earlier. It doesn't help it make
[02:01:56.880 --> 02:02:02.160]  some worse. That's what the studies show and so the question is the immigration level is much
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:05.920]  bigger than they're admitting. We've proven that here in the US. It's probably 50 times what they're
[02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:11.040]  saying. I mean each high school has like 200 plus people. They claim the whole state has 400 refugees.
[02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:15.280]  Austin's got tens of thousands. I mean you ought to go to the mall. It's like I live in Baghdad
[02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:19.120]  or something. I mean Baghdad's like I live in Riyadh Saudi Arabia. I appreciate your call sir
[02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:24.400]  from Canada. What do you make of what he's saying because I mean the numbers are much larger.
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:29.040]  What shows me it is a secretive program. They admit Europe covered up the real numbers. What's
[02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:35.040]  going on here? Look if we say that we must self censor because other people might get upset
[02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:41.120]  we've already lost free speech. Fascism finally emerges after people have been silenced already
[02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:46.080]  and that way they have very little left to lose. Yes and so we must continue to speak the truth.
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:51.280]  I really dislike the idea that we can't criticize groups because it might upset them. Hey as a
[02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:56.160]  white male I've taken a lot of criticism over the years. A white patriarch racist you know whatever
[02:02:56.160 --> 02:02:59.760]  and nobody's really caring that much about my feelings so I'm really not sure that I should
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:03.120]  overly work myself. I was about to say I used to be more politically correct because I was mainly
[02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:07.280]  covering globalism, the new world order, the fellow reserve, big issues but now it's gotten so
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:12.720]  bullying, so out of control. I know I've got to show folks have the courage to practice the first
[02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:19.200]  amendment or we're gonna lose it. Well and the other thing too look I think everybody with compassion
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:26.160]  looks at the wreckage that American foreign policy and aggression has wreaked in the Middle East.
[02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:30.160]  I mean we feel sorry and say bring them in but the same folks that did that are the ones bringing
[02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:34.480]  them in. Well here's the thing though look if those wars were justified then you don't take the
[02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:38.080]  victims of war. If those wars were not justified as I believe they weren't then maybe you can
[02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:41.920]  start looking into war crimes trials for your own leaders. That's right let's execute the people
[02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:47.040]  that launch the phony wars. Let's not blame the country and then bring the people in. So if you
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:51.600]  care about the refugees and I do then you look at it rationally and critically and you say what is
[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:56.560]  more expensive. We have finite resources in all societies. We have finite resources. How can we
[02:03:56.560 --> 02:04:01.200]  best help those people? Well studies have shown very clearly it costs about a thousand dollars
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:05.840]  to resettle a migrant in the Middle East and in the US it costs thirteen thousand dollars to bring
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:11.440]  them to the US and that's just short term. The numbers go up from there. So if you want to help
[02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:15.520]  people in the Middle East talk to your government since today. Sure. Let's take our tax money or
[02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:19.920]  let's take our private charity and help the Muslims resettle in the Middle East to countries that
[02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:25.280]  happen. Sure but I mean this final point Stefan. 80% are military age men. Most of them are people
[02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:28.800]  that invaded Syria. Now they're getting their butt kicked by the Russians and they're going into
[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:35.200]  Turkey and they're being used as a political tool. They're getting more money than citizens get
[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:39.680]  and most of them are radical Wahhabis. They're not letting Shiites or Christians who need to get
[02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:45.040]  out in. Have you noticed that? Well the Prime Minister of Canada was willing to accept Christians
[02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:50.400]  and well then he got voted out. So Christianity is compatible with Christianity. This should
[02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:54.320]  not be brain surgery right. I mean if you're going to hire someone to answer your phones it
[02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:58.320]  helps if they speak your language. That's right. Stefan great job. Thanks for your work. Stefan
[02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:26.720]  Malinik. We'll be back. Joe Biggs here with infowars.com. This is a Hillary Clinton ad from 2008. It's 3 a.m. and your children are safe and asleep but there's a phone in the White House and it's ringing. Something's happening in the world. Hello Secretary Clinton. This is Ambassador Stevens. We are under attack here in Benghazi. Hello. Your vote will decide who answers that call. Bob what time it goes. 3 a.m.
[02:05:26.720 --> 02:05:56.640]  Whether it's someone who already knows the world's leaders, knows the military, someone tested and ready to lead in a dangerous war. Oh cool. She should answer. She said she would. Hello. We're under attack. The building's on fire. They're shooting at us. There's explosion. Where the f*** are you? You said you were going to answer. Come on Secretary Clinton. We need you. Don't leave us. It's 3 a.m. and your children are safe and asleep. Who do you want answering the phone? What difference at this point does it make?
[02:05:56.640 --> 02:06:00.640]  I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message.

[02:08:20.640 --> 02:08:25.640]  The article's up on infowars.com. New video, premieres.
[02:08:25.640 --> 02:08:33.640]  Smashing Pumpkin's founder Billy Corrigan warns of the threat to liberty posed by social justice warrior movement.
[02:08:33.640 --> 02:08:37.640]  Smashing Pumpkin's founder breaks down the social justice warrior movement.
[02:08:37.640 --> 02:08:46.640]  And we can also add an addendum that he's also pointing out that this Facebook situation where they've been caught censoring anything that's
[02:08:46.640 --> 02:08:52.640]  not pro-New World Order, world government, anything libertarian, anything conservative, anything even anti-war,
[02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:59.640]  they're funding Black Lives Matter, it's all a big destabilization program.
[02:08:59.640 --> 02:09:04.640]  And so I'm going to air part of this 33-minute interview now and then when Paul Watson takes over in the fourth hour,
[02:09:04.640 --> 02:09:07.640]  we're going to air the rest of it for the radio and TV audience.
[02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:11.640]  The full video is now up on infowars.com and it's an interesting interview.
[02:09:11.640 --> 02:09:15.640]  He's a smart guy, sold 40-50 million records, has a lot of great fans.
[02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:20.640]  But he's able to reach out to liberals and I don't want to say trendies, but you know,
[02:09:20.640 --> 02:09:25.640]  a lot of folks that wouldn't be into patriot politics.
[02:09:25.640 --> 02:09:30.640]  And of course we had his doctor on last week, what a smart lady getting into vaccines, medical doctor.
[02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:32.640]  Just Billy Corrigan's a cool guy.
[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:36.640]  I don't just have people along because they're famous.
[02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:40.640]  I have people along because they're smart, but also because he understands how media works.
[02:09:40.640 --> 02:09:45.640]  He's seen it all in Hollywood, entertainment, in music.
[02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:49.640]  And people get persecuted when they speak out, when they come out and talk about these issues.
[02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:53.640]  And he was attacked. He was here about a month ago, a little less than a month ago.
[02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:55.640]  Did a big interview here, but wanted to say even more.
[02:09:55.640 --> 02:09:56.640]  So we taped this.
[02:09:56.640 --> 02:09:59.640]  So this is a lot of the stuff he didn't say while he was on air with us.
[02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:01.640]  We're going to play part of this right now.
[02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:05.640]  We've got a special guest joining us this dealing with white slavery worldwide.
[02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:10.640]  Very, very powerful information coming up on that front.
[02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:13.640]  But again, this article is on Facebook. It's on Twitter.
[02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:20.640]  Let's get this Billy Corrigan out to everybody so the mainstream media picks it up again, demonizes it, attacks it, blows up in their face.
[02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:22.640]  Hundreds of articles, big TV shows.
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:25.640]  Billy Corrigan says social justice warriors are like the KKK.
[02:10:25.640 --> 02:10:27.640]  They're suppressing speech. They're a threat.
[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:30.640]  Then even Rolling Stone and a bunch of the publications said he's right.
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:31.640]  It's true.
[02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:33.640]  Seinfeld's coming out.
[02:10:33.640 --> 02:10:38.640]  All these other people saying John Cleese, countless others, saying it's out of control.
[02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:39.640]  It is.
[02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:44.640]  We can defeat this culture war to shut down free speech when more people have courage like Billy Corrigan.
[02:10:44.640 --> 02:10:45.640]  Again, I'm Alex Jones.

[02:11:18.640 --> 02:11:21.640]  Now let's go to part of this powerful Billy Corrigan interview.
[02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:23.640]  Welcome to the Infowars Nightly News.
[02:11:23.640 --> 02:11:25.640]  This is a very special report.
[02:11:25.640 --> 02:11:33.640]  Joining me in studio now is musical icon and great patriot Billy Corrigan of Smashing Pumpkin's Fame.
[02:11:33.640 --> 02:11:35.640]  Now you've obviously sold millions of records.
[02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:36.640]  You're back on the road.
[02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:41.640]  And now you are joining us here in our new studio here in Austin, Texas.
[02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:42.640]  Welcome back.
[02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:43.640]  This is the new old news video.
[02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:44.640]  Yes.
[02:11:44.640 --> 02:11:45.640]  Yeah.
[02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:48.640]  All the fans out there, all of your support helped to build this place.
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:51.640]  It's no longer a deep dark cave of sadness.
[02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:53.640]  It actually feels welcoming.
[02:11:53.640 --> 02:11:55.640]  Before it was sort of foreboding.
[02:11:55.640 --> 02:11:56.640]  Yes.
[02:11:56.640 --> 02:12:00.640]  Very much foreboding, you know, which could be fitting sometimes within the Infowar.
[02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:05.640]  But so now you were on the Alex Jones show earlier today and I thought it was just a
[02:12:05.640 --> 02:12:09.640]  really prescient, speaking about breaking people out of this trance.
[02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:16.640]  And, you know, I feel like we're truly living the Orwellian nightmare.
[02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:20.640]  And it's almost as if it's been programmed and preparing us for this.
[02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:23.640]  And the Matrix is here.
[02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:28.640]  Yeah, it's really bizarre to me because I grew up, I was born in 1967.
[02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:34.640]  And in school, at a very young age, we read Animal Farm and we read 1984.
[02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:40.640]  And of course, what I took from that is this is never going to happen in America.
[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:42.640]  We had to take the Constitution test.
[02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:47.640]  So whether I was being propagandized in the positive, I was being informed that America
[02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:54.640]  is not like this. To actually see in my lifetime, America go from the world that I believed in
[02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:58.640]  then to the world I see now is literally mind-blowing.
[02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:04.640]  And to be participating not only at the citizen level, in the local community level.
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:09.640]  You know, I have a business where I live outside of Chicago and so I deal with the local
[02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:11.640]  government and that type of stuff.
[02:13:11.640 --> 02:13:17.640]  But then also be a public person and be part of the zeitgeist at different times to be used
[02:13:17.640 --> 02:13:21.640]  and abused positively and negatively within the systems that exist today.
[02:13:21.640 --> 02:13:28.640]  And see how my participation is a constant decision-making between either my helping
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:31.640]  and my hurting and my informing or I'm actually enslaving.
[02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:35.640]  That's a difficult thing to take on.
[02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:43.640]  Yeah, so to learn that what the collectivist vision in Animal Farm in 1984 was actually
[02:13:43.640 --> 02:13:47.640]  our future and not this preventative thing kind of blows my mind.
[02:13:47.640 --> 02:13:52.640]  I can't believe we're even having this discussion, if you can understand why I say that to you humbly.
[02:13:52.640 --> 02:14:01.640]  To be talking in America in 2016 about Mao's a good idea and a socialist is running for
[02:14:01.640 --> 02:14:05.640]  president and that's okay and we're going to go back to these kind of crazy tax rates
[02:14:05.640 --> 02:14:09.640]  where we're going to completely disempower the innovators in our country because the new
[02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:12.640]  class, the new technocratic class wants to keep their position and they want to keep
[02:14:12.640 --> 02:14:14.640]  anybody else from coming in the game.
[02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:15.640]  I mean, it's just crazy to me.
[02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:20.640]  Yeah, how do you think people can get around the millions of people that were murdered
[02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:23.640]  under these communist regimes and just say, well, you know, that just happened then.
[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:28.640]  Here's the thing, you know, obviously I listen to you and I listen to Alex, I listen to David
[02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:35.640]  Knight, you guys do a fine job of identifying the factual root and of course sometimes because
[02:14:35.640 --> 02:14:39.640]  you don't have all the information you have to speculate and as I once told Alex literally
[02:14:39.640 --> 02:14:42.640]  sitting in this exact spot, you don't always have to be right.
[02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:45.640]  You just have to have the right intention to want to get to the truth.
[02:14:45.640 --> 02:14:47.640]  As long as you want to get to the truth and that's your intention, that's fine.
[02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:51.640]  But what I would say to you and I say this very plainly to you is that most people don't
[02:14:51.640 --> 02:14:53.640]  care about facts.
[02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:55.640]  Most people do not care about facts.
[02:14:55.640 --> 02:14:58.640]  They don't work in the entertainment business.
[02:14:58.640 --> 02:15:00.640]  People in entertainment business do not care about facts.
[02:15:00.640 --> 02:15:02.640]  They only care about facts when it involves a gross.
[02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:03.640]  We spent this much.
[02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:04.640]  How much do we make?
[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:05.640]  How much do we lose?
[02:15:05.640 --> 02:15:07.640]  Up until that point, it's all in their mind.
[02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:12.640]  So for most Americans or most people listening internationally, it is in your mind.
[02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:16.640]  Literally, you are fighting phantoms that do not exist.
[02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:23.640]  Now, if you're intelligent, which I think most people that listen to this show are,
[02:15:23.640 --> 02:15:29.640]  they don't see how you've been engineered and steered and people are heavily invested
[02:15:29.640 --> 02:15:31.640]  in convincing you of something.
[02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:34.640]  We all know the advertising model.
[02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:38.640]  Women very much understand from a very young age, you start being told,
[02:15:38.640 --> 02:15:41.640]  you got to look like this, you got to think like this, you got to do this in your head,
[02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:42.640]  blah, blah, blah.
[02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:43.640]  Young men, it comes a little bit later.
[02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:47.640]  And it usually comes through sports, which is why it's so heavily invested in sports,
[02:15:47.640 --> 02:15:50.640]  the beer, the culture, the bro, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:53.640]  Okay, we all understand that and we don't, it doesn't really bother us.
[02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:58.640]  We like when a clever ad manipulates us to want us to buy a certain product or something.
[02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:03.640]  What we don't realize is think about people who have trillions on the line getting you
[02:16:03.640 --> 02:16:08.640]  to believe a lie or lean you a certain way so that they can achieve some men that's
[02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:10.640]  10 years down the road that you don't even have the read for.
[02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:14.640]  So imagine here's somebody like Alex Cummins and he actually has the read or he's talking
[02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:17.640]  to other people who have the read and they can see 10 years down the road.
[02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:21.640]  You, you sit here in this spot and you present those facts to people and they go,
[02:16:21.640 --> 02:16:23.640]  what does that have to do with me?
[02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:24.640]  Right.
[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:30.640]  So to me, the next stage in the info war is to get at the ground level, at the cultural
[02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:35.640]  level, which is where most people interface with the propagandizing and the manipulation
[02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:37.640]  and help them understand.
[02:16:37.640 --> 02:16:41.640]  Because I think most people's natural human instinct when they realize they're being
[02:16:41.640 --> 02:16:46.640]  manipulated is to get bad because ultimately it's an insult to their intelligence.
[02:16:46.640 --> 02:16:47.640]  Right.
[02:16:47.640 --> 02:16:51.640]  Or to deny, deny, deny because they don't want to admit that they've gotten they've been
[02:16:51.640 --> 02:17:00.640]  hurt or disenfranchised their sovereign right to make an independent decision based on fact.
[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:06.640]  Now, most people don't care, like I said, if they're being manipulated and buying a product.
[02:17:06.640 --> 02:17:10.640]  If they realize that they're ultimately enslaving themselves to a system that's not only going
[02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:12.640]  to hurt them, but it's going to hurt their children.
[02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:14.640]  That's when their instinct kicks in.
[02:17:14.640 --> 02:17:15.640]  Right.
[02:17:15.640 --> 02:17:17.640]  And that's when fact doesn't matter.
[02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:18.640]  Right.
[02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:20.640]  So you can present people fact all day.
[02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:23.640]  If they are hypnotized, they are not going to hear you.
[02:17:23.640 --> 02:17:25.640]  They're conditioning your children.
[02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:28.640]  And so you'll see some of these Disney cartoons and things like that.
[02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:33.640]  We spoke about shutterbug time where it's this bug that's a drone that's spying on kids
[02:17:33.640 --> 02:17:38.640]  and it's just conditioning them to be completely okay with constant surveillance reporting back
[02:17:38.640 --> 02:17:42.640]  to central command about whatever it is that you're doing inside the privacy of your own
[02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:43.640]  house.
[02:17:43.640 --> 02:17:44.640]  So let's explore that for a second.
[02:17:44.640 --> 02:17:45.640]  Now, I'm on the entertainment side.
[02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:47.640]  I'm in these meetings with people.
[02:17:47.640 --> 02:17:52.640]  I recently had a meeting with a big studio that I might participate in.
[02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:57.640]  Those people at the ground level are not part of some governmental cabal.
[02:17:57.640 --> 02:17:58.640]  Right.
[02:17:58.640 --> 02:18:01.640]  They might even themselves be okay with those ideas.
[02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:09.640]  So on the realm of opinion, somebody working in a big studio could say, Leanne, I've been
[02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:11.640]  friends with the creator of that show for 20 years.
[02:18:11.640 --> 02:18:14.640]  It's got nothing to do with government surveillance.
[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:16.640]  And you could say, well, I disagree.
[02:18:16.640 --> 02:18:20.640]  So an observer would sit back and say, Leanne has an opinion and this person over here who's
[02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:23.640]  invested in the series and put capital and they believe in it and they love it and they
[02:18:23.640 --> 02:18:25.640]  think it's great for children or whatever.
[02:18:25.640 --> 02:18:29.640]  You present it as, have you thought of it like this?
[02:18:29.640 --> 02:18:34.640]  My perspective is this is something that kind of, if I was a parent or thinking of my own
[02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:37.640]  nieces and nephews, this kind of troubles me.
[02:18:37.640 --> 02:18:38.640]  And here's why.
[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:43.640]  So all you're doing is you're presenting kind of a range of ideas to someone and letting
[02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:47.640]  them make the choice whether or not that's something they want their children participating
[02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:48.640]  in.
[02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:53.640]  Because maybe on their particular range of belief, they don't want their children conditioned
[02:18:53.640 --> 02:18:56.640]  to believe that surveillance is okay.
[02:18:56.640 --> 02:19:00.640]  Because even if you can make an argument for surveillance is okay, a lot of us that grew
[02:19:00.640 --> 02:19:04.640]  up in the 60s and 70s, we were told, don't trust strangers.
[02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:08.640]  Because there was a rash of a pedophile incident.
[02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:10.640]  I grew up around when John Wayne Gacy was killing kids.
[02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:13.640]  I mean, I literally lived down the road from where that happened.
[02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:16.640]  So you can imagine being 10 years old and hearing about kids being murdered and put
[02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:17.640]  in basements.
[02:19:17.640 --> 02:19:18.640]  I mean, it terrified us.
[02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:21.640]  So suddenly all the parents were like, don't trust strangers.
[02:19:21.640 --> 02:19:26.640]  So something as simple as that, which maybe has no nefarious undertones.
[02:19:26.640 --> 02:19:27.640]  Let's fade that down.
[02:19:27.640 --> 02:19:28.640]  Still at some point a parent might say.
[02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:31.640]  We're going to come back with more of the interview and then finish it with Paul Joseph
[02:19:31.640 --> 02:19:35.640]  Watson will air it all tonight in the nightly news as well.
[02:19:35.640 --> 02:19:39.640]  It's a very powerful interview and we're working on with Billy every week having him do baby
[02:19:39.640 --> 02:19:43.640]  five, 10 minutes of commentary on popular media to show the propaganda.
[02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:45.640]  He's mentioning one serial killer.
[02:19:45.640 --> 02:19:47.640]  Suddenly everybody's scared, thinks it's an epidemic.
[02:19:47.640 --> 02:19:49.640]  One great white shark attack.
[02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:54.640]  Then on the coastline of St. California and for a year, half the tourism goes down to
[02:19:54.640 --> 02:19:56.640]  people surfing or swimming.
[02:19:56.640 --> 02:19:58.640]  I mean, it's just total hysteria.
[02:19:58.640 --> 02:20:03.640]  It's mind control.
[02:20:03.640 --> 02:20:08.640]  I'm Nick Sobolesky, a select quote agent with a true story of how select quote goes to bat
[02:20:08.640 --> 02:20:10.640]  for you buying term life insurance.
[02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:14.640]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:16.640]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote.
[02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:18.640]  Another life insurance agent had given him.
[02:20:18.640 --> 02:20:20.640]  I said, let me see.
[02:20:20.640 --> 02:20:25.640]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly rated price competitive
[02:20:25.640 --> 02:20:30.640]  companies we represent and found one who pre approved him for a premium way below what
[02:20:30.640 --> 02:20:31.640]  he had been quoted.
[02:20:31.640 --> 02:20:36.640]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes,
[02:20:36.640 --> 02:20:43.640]  experience and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.

[02:21:00.640 --> 02:21:04.640]  Do you have dry hands or itchy peeling skin?
[02:21:04.640 --> 02:21:07.640]  Are your cracked feet in need of a makeover for sandal season?
[02:21:07.640 --> 02:21:13.640]  Hi, my name is Diane Cook, the creator of Beespa hand and foot cream.
[02:21:13.640 --> 02:21:20.640]  Beespa is all natural, 16% beeswax, marigold extract and other essential oils and nutrients.
[02:21:20.640 --> 02:21:27.640]  Beespa is great for exceptionally dry hands and feet, but Beespa can be used anywhere on the body.
[02:21:27.640 --> 02:21:30.640]  I am sure you will see a difference overnight.

[02:24:59.640 --> 02:25:02.640]  That's telling that it's okay to be observed by a stranger.
[02:25:02.640 --> 02:25:06.640]  And that's not to assign a nefarious intent to the creator.
[02:25:06.640 --> 02:25:08.640]  And it's not to say you have to be right.
[02:25:08.640 --> 02:25:19.640]  You can just raise the question and it's really more about the cultural discussion of whether it's appropriate in the wider culture to accept these ideas as normalized, which is where I get funky on that.
[02:25:19.640 --> 02:25:20.640]  Right.
[02:25:20.640 --> 02:25:27.640]  I don't like the normalization of things that really need heavy, intense peer and cultural review before we kind of stamp and say, that's okay.
[02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:32.640]  Drones, for example, is something as particularly as a person in public life.
[02:25:32.640 --> 02:25:36.640]  And I would guess you as a young woman, that's a troubling thing.
[02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:44.640]  If you have to think every time you're near an open window and you're taking off or putting on your clothes or you're picking your nose or something, you have to think, is somebody watching me?
[02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:46.640]  And is this going to end up on a system?
[02:25:46.640 --> 02:25:51.640]  And is that 10 seconds going to haunt me for the rest of my life, particularly in a social media world where I can be tagged?
[02:25:51.640 --> 02:25:53.640]  And basically you work here, you're a public person.
[02:25:53.640 --> 02:25:55.640]  So those are issues you have to think through.
[02:25:55.640 --> 02:26:03.640]  So why isn't there a greater cultural peer review about the proper use of drones in situations?
[02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:06.640]  Why isn't there a more wide-ranging discussion?
[02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:08.640]  That to me is a discussion we should have as citizens.
[02:26:08.640 --> 02:26:09.640]  Right.
[02:26:09.640 --> 02:26:16.640]  Well, I know, for instance, when I switched over my phone to an Android, not even thinking about it, I didn't realize that you had to turn off all of these systems.
[02:26:16.640 --> 02:26:22.640]  And at one point, I just randomly discovered that my phone had been tracking my most visited places.
[02:26:22.640 --> 02:26:27.640]  And hey, isn't this great? Don't you want everyone to know where you work, where you live, where you shop?
[02:26:27.640 --> 02:26:31.640]  No, I don't want any, I mean, that's frightening to me.
[02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:34.640]  At one point, I had linked some social media thing to my phone.
[02:26:34.640 --> 02:26:38.640]  And as you can imagine, I have a lot of famous people in my phone.
[02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:46.640]  And that social media system went in my phone because I downloaded the app and poached all the names and had posted them on the Internet.
[02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:51.640]  And I remember talking to somebody from the company and they were like, well, those are private in the hacking world?
[02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:52.640]  No, exactly.
[02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:53.640]  Hello.
[02:26:53.640 --> 02:27:00.640]  Yeah, it's not private to people who have broken into the government office there in Pentagon and have exposed your private profession.
[02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:01.640]  These are things that we should discuss.
[02:27:01.640 --> 02:27:13.640]  So I like the idea and I'm pushing for, you know, and I think you're the perfect person to approach this from that systemic review, from the standpoint of the Info War.
[02:27:13.640 --> 02:27:14.640]  Are we okay?
[02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:15.640]  Okay, here's a new show.
[02:27:15.640 --> 02:27:17.640]  Are we comfortable with these concepts?
[02:27:17.640 --> 02:27:23.640]  Here's a movie where, you know, the director of the movie is openly called for open borders.
[02:27:23.640 --> 02:27:25.640]  Are we okay with that?
[02:27:25.640 --> 02:27:27.640]  Are we okay with the messaging in the movie?
[02:27:27.640 --> 02:27:28.640]  Is that okay?
[02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:30.640]  Do we want to participate that on a cultural level?
[02:27:30.640 --> 02:27:31.640]  And I'm not calling for boycotts.
[02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:32.640]  I'm an artist.
[02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:38.640]  I'm calling for an open, free society that deals with these ideas equally and fairly.
[02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:44.640]  And that collectively, in the right use of the word, we can come to a better cultural point of view.
[02:27:44.640 --> 02:27:48.640]  I mean, it's pretty remarkable that like literally, okay, I'm talking to you, right?
[02:27:48.640 --> 02:27:51.640]  I could say one word right now that would destroy my career.
[02:27:51.640 --> 02:28:00.640]  I could use the wrong racial epithet or say the wrong thing to you or look down at the wrong part of your body and be castigated and it's a meme and I'm a horrible person.
[02:28:00.640 --> 02:28:06.640]  Every day, through the media, through advertising, we see people being degraded.
[02:28:06.640 --> 02:28:09.640]  We see people doing all sorts of things that we should be horrified as a culture.
[02:28:09.640 --> 02:28:16.640]  So we've normalized all sorts of things, but now we live in a world where one word can destroy your life.
[02:28:16.640 --> 02:28:20.640]  But it's okay to, if you're a social justice lawyer, spit in somebody's face.
[02:28:20.640 --> 02:28:21.640]  Right.
[02:28:21.640 --> 02:28:26.640]  That's okay because you've been, you're a victim, so it's okay.
[02:28:26.640 --> 02:28:27.640]  Right.
[02:28:27.640 --> 02:28:30.640]  So under the same ideology, I didn't like the way you spoke to me earlier.
[02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:33.640]  So I should be able to denigrate you because that's okay.
[02:28:33.640 --> 02:28:37.640]  I mean, that's where we're losing the plot and quickly too, I would have.
[02:28:37.640 --> 02:28:38.640]  Right.
[02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:47.640]  So that's something that is kind of a big issue right now is it's this whole cultural racial thing where you can't say anything if you're white.
[02:28:47.640 --> 02:28:53.640]  There was actually the white privilege conference that just took place the 17th annual, one who knew.
[02:28:53.640 --> 02:28:55.640]  God, I didn't get my invitation.
[02:28:55.640 --> 02:28:56.640]  No, I know.
[02:28:56.640 --> 02:29:07.640]  So, but there was a woman who had attended and she was tweeting out how the white speaker took too long and that's like the perfect example of white privilege over his time.
[02:29:07.640 --> 02:29:09.640]  And here's now here's that's a perfect example.
[02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:10.640]  Okay.
[02:29:10.640 --> 02:29:11.640]  I'm the type of person.
[02:29:11.640 --> 02:29:12.640]  I saw that report.
[02:29:12.640 --> 02:29:14.640]  I was fascinated by it.
[02:29:14.640 --> 02:29:22.640]  I actually went to the women's Twitter account and I read a bunch of her tweets because as somebody in public life, I know not to just.
[02:29:22.640 --> 02:29:27.640]  We're going to back this up a few minutes and play the rest of it coming up at the bottom of the next hour and Paul Watson's hosting.
[02:29:27.640 --> 02:29:30.640]  I mean, Billy Corgan is just really knows what he's talking about.
[02:29:30.640 --> 02:29:39.640]  He's talking about having a cultural debate about how we're being manipulated and bringing back the social contract to say what do we really want as a society and a civilization.
[02:29:39.640 --> 02:29:48.640]  But we're going to talk to a suppressed journalist, investigative reporter who couldn't get her book published forever until now about sex slave trafficking.
[02:29:48.640 --> 02:30:00.640]  We're going down the rabbit hole.
[02:30:00.640 --> 02:30:06.640]  Prepping for disaster and societal unrest has now gone so mainstream that even realtor.com is writing about it.
[02:30:06.640 --> 02:30:15.640]  But the realtors are still embarrassed to cover the subject and eager to set themselves apart from what they call Uncle Travis's guns and canned foods militia vision of preparedness.
[02:30:15.640 --> 02:30:22.640]  Well, the ants may have the last laugh on the grasshoppers, but the grasshoppers will still sing the tune if they can make money.
[02:30:22.640 --> 02:30:29.640]  But maybe you don't have a Hollywood mansion where you can drop another million dollars to turn your home theater into a radiation proof bunker.
[02:30:29.640 --> 02:30:33.640]  There are still very effective low tech, low cost things you can do to prepare.
[02:30:33.640 --> 02:30:41.640]  In fact, even realizing that there's a need to prepare and doing anything to act on that realization increases your chances of survival.
[02:30:41.640 --> 02:30:50.640]  Things that you do to prepare for an Armageddon scenario will help you to weather storms, to absorb an economic shock or to protect you from home invasion.
[02:30:50.640 --> 02:30:56.640]  Prepare for the worst case scenario while you educate yourself and others and work for the best case scenario.

[02:33:04.640 --> 02:33:19.640]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com. Now I have some footage of Hillary Clinton that I believe will help boost her campaign into the next zone, leaving Bernie Sanders completely in the dust.
[02:33:19.640 --> 02:33:26.640]  Now she did lose last night and somehow ended up getting the same amount of delegates as Bernie Sanders.
[02:33:26.640 --> 02:33:37.640]  But thanks to some whistleblowers, we actually have exclusive footage, never before seen footage of a Hillary Clinton ad that I believe will set her over the top.
[02:33:37.640 --> 02:33:57.640]  Let's take a look at that ad.
[02:34:07.640 --> 02:34:15.640]  Oh cool, she should answer. She said she would. Hello, we're under attack. The building's on fire. The shooting at us. There's explosion.
[02:34:15.640 --> 02:34:22.640]  Where the f*** are you? You said you were going to answer. Come on Secretary Clinton, we need you. Don't leave us.
[02:34:22.640 --> 02:34:28.640]  It's 3 AM and your children are safe and asleep. Who do you want answering the phone?
[02:34:28.640 --> 02:34:30.640]  What difference at this point does it make?
[02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:52.640]  I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message.
[02:34:52.640 --> 02:35:02.640]  You want to stand up in the info war and say I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this but you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[02:35:02.640 --> 02:35:13.640]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:35:13.640 --> 02:35:35.640]  The balance of the hour before Paul Watson takes over, hosting from London and Billy Corgan interview is premiered and completed. We are joined by a lady who I know, Jakari Jackson is definitely going to want to interview because he's really been on the slavery beat as a reporter documenting the slavery just as prevalent now with sheer numbers as it was 200 years ago.
[02:35:35.640 --> 02:36:02.640]  She's been a crisis communications advisor to several Fortune 400 companies. She comes very highly recommended by Victor Ostrowski who helped publish her book, who's a massage whistleblower who we've had on as a guest who exposed massage false flags but also other government criminal activities.
[02:36:02.640 --> 02:36:17.640]  She helped, she's the best selling author publish her book, she's an investigative journalist who spent years trying to get it out and it's finally been published. She also focuses in on Jeffrey Epstein who is at the center of the pedophile island.
[02:36:17.640 --> 02:36:36.640]  So, Traffic King is the book and the website is Conchita Sarnoff, C-O-N-C-H-I-T-A Sarnoff dot com. And I'm going to tweet out at real Alex Jones and also put a link to her on Facebook because this is important. This is just a quick 25 minute interview or so.
[02:36:36.640 --> 02:36:50.640]  But we will have her back as an expert to drill more into this because I don't cover modern slavery to lessen the horrible transatlantic slave trade that killed millions of people, tens of millions of people and slave hundreds of millions in the aggregate.
[02:36:50.640 --> 02:37:02.640]  Or the Arab slave trade that was even bigger or the Roman slave trade or the Chinese slave trade. I mean every culture's done it, doesn't mean it's good. We as a culture said this is a bad contract. We don't like this. We're not doing this.
[02:37:02.640 --> 02:37:16.640]  But the type of slavery now is kids and women of every race, color and creed. And the most disadvantaged, you know, people that are also grabbed out of countries and taken to islands as slave labor, Foxcombe factories, Apple, the suicide nets.
[02:37:16.640 --> 02:37:31.640]  I mean this is bigger than it was at the peak of slavery here in 1800. And every historian admits that. So we're so busy trying to ban the word lynch. There's a scarce folks, the Irish name and brown paper bags that we're not focusing in on this.
[02:37:31.640 --> 02:37:49.640]  But she also heads up an organization that exposes all this ATRVT.org. And, you know, the best way to break this down is she's an investigative reporter for the Daily Beast with her expose behind the pedophile sweetheart deal, published the Daily Beast and was submitted for the Pulitzer Prize.
[02:37:49.640 --> 02:38:02.640]  There's so much more to go over with her. So, so in the time we've got, you just take over here and break down the basics, your background and where this rabbit hole really goes. Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:38:02.640 --> 02:38:07.640]  Thank you, Alex, very much for having me on your show. I appreciate it.
[02:38:07.640 --> 02:38:21.640]  You said this has been a long journey, because the establishment both, both parties, Republicans and Democrats have tried to silence the information that is included in the book.
[02:38:21.640 --> 02:38:36.640]  The book is more a reportage of not only my journey in the underbelly of human trafficking, but also it is, it exposes the longest running US federal human trafficking case.
[02:38:36.640 --> 02:38:47.640]  And here is a case that started Mr. Jeffrey Epstein, who is a registered level three sex offender, was arrested in 2005.
[02:38:47.640 --> 02:38:56.640]  He was indicted two years later in October 2007 for one count of solicitation of prostitution with a minor.
[02:38:56.640 --> 02:39:16.640]  And the incredible thing is that they even identified the victims as prostitutes or the victim instead of identifying them as what they are, which is victims because any girl aged 15, 14, 13, 16, certainly under the age of 18 should not be labeled as a prostitute.
[02:39:16.640 --> 02:39:23.640]  She or he should be labeled as a victim, especially when they're up against a grown adult.
[02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:33.640]  So here was this case that I stumbled into having come back from Mexico and almost losing my life.
[02:39:33.640 --> 02:39:45.640]  I was threatened by a government official, an agency official to be, I was going to be lynched if I asked another question, according to the lady who I was interviewing.
[02:39:45.640 --> 02:40:00.640]  And after coming back from that harrowing trip, and of course, after also being offered a bribe, not to write this book, I realized that this case was important on different levels.
[02:40:00.640 --> 02:40:04.640]  The most important level was the cover up.
[02:40:04.640 --> 02:40:17.640]  I believe, in my opinion, that this cover up was far greater than the Watergate and the Lewinsky scandal and the Profumo affair combined.
[02:40:17.640 --> 02:40:22.640]  I believe this is a very important case because it's set precedent.
[02:40:22.640 --> 02:40:42.640]  The reason it has set precedent, Alex, is because we have several cases, human trafficking cases in the state of Florida that have tried to use the Epstein defense as their defense in order not to go to jail and in order to get less time.
[02:40:42.640 --> 02:40:44.640]  There's one particular case today.
[02:40:44.640 --> 02:40:52.640]  The defendant's name, ironically, is Archangel Michael Hernandez. He's a Hispanic male.
[02:40:52.640 --> 02:40:54.640]  He's clearly not rich.
[02:40:54.640 --> 02:41:09.640]  And in his defense, his attorney, Joel de Fabio, also from Miami, his defense claimed that because he was a poor Latino and not friendly with our former president, Bill Clinton.
[02:41:09.640 --> 02:41:20.640]  He is now looking at eight to 10 years for some of the similar charges that Mr. Epstein was charged with.
[02:41:20.640 --> 02:41:30.640]  So here you have a case, how many years later, 2016, going back and using a 2007 defense.
[02:41:30.640 --> 02:41:36.640]  And that's why I thought this case, one of the reasons why this case was so important is because it now has set precedent.
[02:41:36.640 --> 02:41:44.640]  Sure, them only giving Epstein a slap on the wrist when he's bringing all these presidents and role leaders out to Petafile Island with girls as young as what, 10 years old.
[02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:47.640]  This is creating a precedent to give a slap on the wrist.
[02:41:47.640 --> 02:41:48.640]  And listen, I'm a libertarian.
[02:41:48.640 --> 02:41:53.640]  I don't approve a lot of the stuff going on, but if it's consensual and it's adults, you know, leave it alone.
[02:41:53.640 --> 02:41:56.640]  I mean, I'm not for drugs, but I'm for decriminalization.
[02:41:56.640 --> 02:41:59.640]  I'm not for prostitution, but I'm for decriminalization.
[02:41:59.640 --> 02:42:15.640]  But when you involve minors, I want to come down hard on folks, but it seems like with the Catholic Church or Boys Town or Penn State, when you've got a high government officials involved, it gets covered up because this is, you know, just a crime too big to be prosecuted.
[02:42:15.640 --> 02:42:17.640]  And so it's just amazing.
[02:42:17.640 --> 02:42:27.640]  I mean, how deep does this rabbit hole go for folks that don't know, talk about some of the stuff, how young these children are, some of the numbers we're talking about here, how big this trafficking is.
[02:42:27.640 --> 02:42:38.640]  Okay, well, let's let's start with in 2012, Congress reported that there were 300,000 American that is US born children being trafficked in the United States.
[02:42:38.640 --> 02:42:40.640]  That's in 2012.
[02:42:40.640 --> 02:42:42.640]  The number has now risen to a million.
[02:42:42.640 --> 02:42:50.640]  The UN, the United Nations claims that there are 22 million children being trafficked worldwide.
[02:42:50.640 --> 02:42:52.640]  That's an enormous number.
[02:42:52.640 --> 02:42:53.640]  However, you slice it.
[02:42:53.640 --> 02:43:02.640]  And according to some media reports, it is a business that is worth over $167 billion.
[02:43:02.640 --> 02:43:08.640]  That is larger than Google, Nike and Starbucks combined and the profits of these three companies combined.
[02:43:08.640 --> 02:43:20.640]  So I believe one of the reasons this business has become so enormous and so out of control is because you've got online into pornography, as you might know, Alex, is the largest business online.
[02:43:20.640 --> 02:43:24.640]  Child pornography is the second largest business online.
[02:43:24.640 --> 02:43:30.640]  Ashton Putscher, the actor, he created a foundation called we are thorn.org.
[02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:37.640]  We are thorn.org, which helps the certain law enforcement agencies with data and metrics.
[02:43:37.640 --> 02:43:42.640]  And he's got some incredible data and facts on that website.
[02:43:42.640 --> 02:43:49.640]  And the reason I'm promoting it is only because it's been very useful to me and to many NGOs that work in the field.
[02:43:49.640 --> 02:43:52.640]  So here we have these numbers that are incredible.
[02:43:52.640 --> 02:44:01.640]  And by the way, the only way, the only method that we actually even have numbers today is because the victims have been arrested.
[02:44:01.640 --> 02:44:05.640]  The police, the local police departments are the first line of defense.
[02:44:05.640 --> 02:44:13.640]  So if a victim, if a child is not arrested, it cannot be identified, whether it's a prostitute or a victim or a trafficker or a pimper or a john.
[02:44:13.640 --> 02:44:22.640]  Now the victims prior to the last, well, I would say within the last five years, a lot of things have changed because the police departments have become very educated.
[02:44:22.640 --> 02:44:26.640]  And that is one thing that my foundation, our organization is attempting to do.
[02:44:26.640 --> 02:44:36.640]  We are attempting to educate all public schools in the 15,000 school districts on how to identify traffickers online, because that's what's happening today.
[02:44:36.640 --> 02:44:44.640]  Traffickers are no longer sitting in a van waiting outside a school or a shopping mall or a movie theater to abduct children and traffic them.
[02:44:44.640 --> 02:44:46.640]  No, they're now going online.
[02:44:46.640 --> 02:44:47.640]  They're chatting up children.
[02:44:47.640 --> 02:44:49.640]  They're befriending them online.
[02:44:49.640 --> 02:44:51.640]  So this is absolutely.
[02:44:51.640 --> 02:44:54.640]  And I've got two daughters that are young and a son.
[02:44:54.640 --> 02:44:59.640]  And, you know, that's why I won't let them on the internet by themselves is because there are these predators posing in there.
[02:44:59.640 --> 02:45:03.640]  And I've seen just reading the news every day for years, a pattern where it's almost always local cops.
[02:45:03.640 --> 02:45:06.640]  Not that they're perfect, but on average, less corrupt.
[02:45:06.640 --> 02:45:08.640]  They're actually busting the pedophiles.
[02:45:08.640 --> 02:45:13.640]  And so many times it's national deputy directors of Homeland Security, top FBI.
[02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:22.640]  And for my research, there's almost like pedophile clubs that are taking over government, just like the Catholic Church, to protect themselves and operate.
[02:45:22.640 --> 02:45:26.640]  And that's why they're trying to federalize local police so that they can't bust up these networks.
[02:45:26.640 --> 02:45:31.640]  But what I've said, does that mesh at any level with what your research has found?
[02:45:31.640 --> 02:45:33.640]  Absolutely. Exactly.
[02:45:33.640 --> 02:45:39.640]  I mean, I believe that's one of the reasons why my book has not was not published for seven years.
[02:45:39.640 --> 02:45:42.640]  And Random House Mexico killed the book deal in 2014.
[02:45:42.640 --> 02:45:45.640]  I mean, I signed a book deal in 2009.
[02:45:45.640 --> 02:45:51.640]  The more I dug, the more I found out, the more I exposed the less they wanted to publish the book.
[02:45:51.640 --> 02:45:55.640]  I have had three agents in the past X number of years.
[02:45:55.640 --> 02:45:58.640]  I mean, I don't want to expose everything because you could, you know,
[02:45:58.640 --> 02:46:03.640]  I understand you've been blocked just like Facebook admits they, you know, they block stuff they don't like.
[02:46:03.640 --> 02:46:05.640]  I mean, this is the age of stealth censorship.
[02:46:05.640 --> 02:46:07.640]  Absolutely. Absolutely.
[02:46:07.640 --> 02:46:10.640]  So, you know, so back to the back to this, this case.
[02:46:10.640 --> 02:46:20.640]  So here we have a case where the pedophile who is a very generous donor to the Democratic Party was given a slap on the wrist.
[02:46:20.640 --> 02:46:30.640]  And and he implicated a number of Democrats, and yet he was pardoned during a Republican administration.
[02:46:30.640 --> 02:46:36.640]  And I'm sure that those who pardoned him were also part of the Republican establishment.
[02:46:36.640 --> 02:46:42.640]  So you've got, you know, both parties who don't really want to expose what went behind the scenes.
[02:46:42.640 --> 02:46:47.640]  But if when you read the book, you'll understand through the Dershowitz deposition, you know,
[02:46:47.640 --> 02:46:53.640]  we even implicated Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, one of the victims, Virginia Louise Roberts,
[02:46:53.640 --> 02:47:00.640]  implicated Professor Dershowitz, and they just settled the case, I believe, on April 8th.
[02:47:00.640 --> 02:47:03.640]  And why, why was this case settled right away?
[02:47:03.640 --> 02:47:06.640]  That's another question you'll find out in the book.
[02:47:06.640 --> 02:47:16.640]  But, you know, there are many questions that I tried to answer as best as I could, because this, this radical, as you call it,
[02:47:16.640 --> 02:47:27.640]  is so deep and so wide that even Alice in Wonderland would have had quite, quite a problem trying to dig herself out of it.
[02:47:27.640 --> 02:47:32.640]  Well, well, Conchita Sarnoff, stay right there. We're going to come back to break and come right back to you.
[02:47:32.640 --> 02:47:35.640]  But I'd say this rabbit hole goes so deep.
[02:47:35.640 --> 02:47:43.640]  It's so frightening to realize the type of monsters we have literally all around us that one control of our society that want to run our lives,
[02:47:43.640 --> 02:47:50.640]  that want to dominate us, that want to be able to shut down the new independent media so this information doesn't come out.
[02:47:50.640 --> 02:47:53.640]  But we're going to cover it here on this broadcast.
[02:47:53.640 --> 02:48:00.640]  Of course, Bill Clinton and others went to that island that Conchita Sarnoff has been for a decade trying to expose the last seven years,
[02:48:00.640 --> 02:48:06.640]  not having her book published, it's now been published, and we'll give you the details of that when we come back from break her website,
[02:48:06.640 --> 02:48:10.640]  so that you can find that and get a copy of that and get that out to other folks.
[02:48:10.640 --> 02:48:15.640]  You may as a viewer or a listener of the show already know all this, but other folks don't.
[02:48:15.640 --> 02:48:18.640]  They just don't realize the level of evil that we're dealing with.
[02:48:18.640 --> 02:48:23.640]  Look at the royal family, all the pedophilia in England, the highest government ministers, they don't even let you in.
[02:48:23.640 --> 02:48:30.640]  A lot of the folks I've been told don't even like this, but they have to do it to become compromised or these mafias don't accept.
[02:48:30.640 --> 02:48:34.640]  You're kind of like low level mob will say, you got to kill somebody who's innocent to be a made man.
[02:48:34.640 --> 02:48:36.640]  Well, that's just regular organized crime.
[02:48:36.640 --> 02:48:42.640]  When you get up to the highest levels of betraying countries and carrying out evil, they go all the way.
[02:48:42.640 --> 02:48:46.640]  So ConchitaSarnoff.com, ATRVT.org.
[02:48:46.640 --> 02:48:49.640]  We're going to go to break, we're going to come right back with her in more.

[02:54:24.640 --> 02:54:26.640]  Big Bad John.
[02:54:55.640 --> 02:55:06.640]  You may agree with censoring conservatives or anti-war people, but it doesn't mean that it should happen.
[02:55:06.640 --> 02:55:12.640]  I mean, there are tyrants out there. Just because some people want to restrict views doesn't mean they have a right to do it.
[02:55:12.640 --> 02:55:19.640]  And see, once that happens, now you can shut down the details of Bill Clinton's best buddy and the pedophile island that we've been exposing.
[02:55:19.640 --> 02:55:32.640]  Now, getting back to our guests, in the five minutes we have left, Conchita, what else is key for you to relate to folks that's in your books to understand why the system is fighting so hard to suppress it?
[02:55:32.640 --> 02:55:45.640]  Alex, I think one of the reasons that propelled me to move forward and to be so persistent was after the fact I met the prosecutor on Epstein's case.
[02:55:45.640 --> 02:55:58.640]  And as you will read in my book, I have his letter and certain documents at the beginning of the book because I needed to relate to the readers how important this particular case is.
[02:55:58.640 --> 02:56:08.640]  Certainly when it comes to our future and the future of our children and the future of the enforcement of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act,
[02:56:08.640 --> 02:56:17.640]  and federal law, the only federal law, one of the only federal laws, forgive me, the most important, that prosecutes traffickers and protects victims.
[02:56:17.640 --> 02:56:26.640]  And so when I met with our Alex Acosta, who was the prosecutor at the time of the Epstein case, he wrote a letter.
[02:56:26.640 --> 02:56:41.640]  I found through a source, I found an email that was written to one of Epstein's defense attorneys. Epstein had several defense attorneys, all very powerful and influential and certain leaders in their fields.
[02:56:41.640 --> 02:56:55.640]  And so the prosecutor wrote in the letter, we, the prosecution, were assaulted, and I quote, assaulted during the time of Epstein's investigation.
[02:56:55.640 --> 02:57:03.640]  Now you tell me, Alex, when does a prosecutor, number one, when does a prosecutor usually speak to a journalist?
[02:57:03.640 --> 02:57:13.640]  One, two, when does a prosecutor use the word assaulted to describe the actions of the defense attorney or defense attorneys?
[02:57:13.640 --> 02:57:19.640]  Oh, absolutely. Look, the folks that went after this comeback were heroes. I mean, this is a death sentence, probably still for them.
[02:57:19.640 --> 02:57:28.640]  And the answer is go after the globalists at every front, just like with the Catholic Church, we're going to end up showing that basically half of these people are pedophiles.
[02:57:28.640 --> 02:57:39.640]  It's a cult of pedophiles. I've studied it for two decades plus. I couldn't believe it when insiders told me 20 years ago, but man, I tell you, it is just totally sick, totally evil, and it describes all the tyranny we see.
[02:57:39.640 --> 02:57:54.640]  I mean, look at this article here out of CNN. Vietnamese girls, we're talking young girls, smuggled into China and sold as child bribes, little kids, like five, six, seven years old, teacher to be prosecuted for calling Muhammad child molester, Breitbart.
[02:57:54.640 --> 02:58:00.640]  I mean, all she said was that, you know, the Quran was saying you go after 12 and 11 year olds. So there's almost like a normalization.
[02:58:00.640 --> 02:58:11.640]  You talked about the U.N. Some of the U.N. exposes it, but the U.N. has also been caught in its own trafficking. U.N. peacekeepers, Dinecore, Halliburton. We've got all that going on.
[02:58:11.640 --> 02:58:16.640]  We've got Nambla trying to get recognized. I mean, there seems to be this whole hidden agenda. What's your view on that?
[02:58:16.640 --> 02:58:37.640]  Yes, I totally agree with you. I mean, I find this confounding. I find the issue of human trafficking confounding in 2016. Number one, because I, like most Americans believe that slavery and this is simply child sex trafficking is a form.
[02:58:37.640 --> 02:58:47.640]  Hold on, do five more minutes with us. We're going into overdrive in FullWars.com. Your station doesn't pick up the fourth hour and the rest of Billy Corgan exclusives coming up as well with Paul Hudson. Stay with us.

[02:59:17.640 --> 02:59:21.640]  I'm a nine-year listener. I buy all the nutraceuticals, AccuFX, Mason, I die.
[02:59:21.640 --> 02:59:23.640]  Why? Let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you?
[02:59:23.640 --> 02:59:26.640]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[02:59:26.640 --> 02:59:27.640]  What products are you taking?
[02:59:27.640 --> 02:59:35.640]  Everything from supermale to brain force to winter sun, X2, even got a little DNA force.
[02:59:35.640 --> 02:59:39.640]  So when I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.
[02:59:39.640 --> 03:00:01.640]  Visit infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourselves. That's infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:00:10.640 --> 03:00:20.640]  Waging War on Corruption. It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[03:00:27.640 --> 03:00:37.640]  Our investigative journalists, Joe Biggs and Wayne Madsen, two days after Scalia was dead, we're down there with David Dine and everybody else, a great crew.
[03:00:37.640 --> 03:00:40.640]  It's that secret of 20,000 acre ranch on the border.
[03:00:40.640 --> 03:00:50.640]  And every hallway was just lined with devil masks, weird murals of children being eaten by devils, little beds outside the rooms, all this weird stuff.
[03:00:50.640 --> 03:00:56.640]  And Wayne Madsen and Biggs said, this looks like Bohemian Grove. This looks like some type of real perv stuff.
[03:00:56.640 --> 03:01:00.640]  This was like a secret society. And then it came on the Washington Post a month later.
[03:01:00.640 --> 03:01:05.640]  I guess to get ahead of us, they went, yeah, it's a secret society for Bohemian Grove meeting. No big deal.
[03:01:05.640 --> 03:01:11.640]  So all I'm telling you is, man, we're in a lot of trouble. And there's a lot of freaks in control.
[03:01:11.640 --> 03:01:17.640]  And you hear about the psychopath that kills people on his own, getting in trouble, but the high level ones, they just run the show.
[03:01:17.640 --> 03:01:26.640]  And this rabbit hole, I remember having John DeKamp, former state senator, former CIA Black Ops commander in Vietnam on.
[03:01:26.640 --> 03:01:32.640]  And he didn't really come on anymore. He's gotten pretty old, has some health issues. I'll just leave it at that.
[03:01:32.640 --> 03:01:36.640]  He wrote the Franklin cover up. Most of what's in that book later came out.
[03:01:36.640 --> 03:01:43.640]  And he was he was on air like 15 years ago going in Boys Town. And then I tell you, Penn State, they sell the kids out of the football program and rape them.
[03:01:43.640 --> 03:01:50.640]  And I took him off air. And it all came out was true.
[03:01:50.640 --> 03:01:56.640]  And I mean, it's just those of us that aren't attracted to children aren't attracted to Satanism. We just don't get it.
[03:01:56.640 --> 03:02:02.640]  Finishing up with our guest. This is really a hard subject to talk about.
[03:02:02.640 --> 03:02:06.640]  The Sarnoff, again, has written the book. It's available on our website.
[03:02:06.640 --> 03:02:11.640]  ConchitaSarnoff.com or ATRVT.org. We only had a few minutes left in the segments over.
[03:02:11.640 --> 03:02:16.640]  But dealing with the rabbit hole, your research, is it a cult? Is it a larger group?
[03:02:16.640 --> 03:02:22.640]  Or is it groups of people that take over institutions? I mean, why is it that so many big institutions end up being run by pedophiles,
[03:02:22.640 --> 03:02:31.640]  universities, colleges, schools, reformatories, religious groups, military groups?
[03:02:31.640 --> 03:02:35.640]  I mean, what is going on from your deep research as an investigative journalist?
[03:02:35.640 --> 03:02:40.640]  Well, look, Alex, I can't I can't tell you for a fact that this is a cult.
[03:02:40.640 --> 03:02:48.640]  I mean, I don't I haven't I haven't studied that and that interesting because that poses another question that I will now pursue.
[03:02:48.640 --> 03:02:56.640]  But I haven't pursued that road yet. But I will tell you that the cartels, the Mexican cartels, the Russian cartels,
[03:02:56.640 --> 03:03:05.640]  the Ukrainian cartels, the Chinese cartels, these the Colombian cartels, these are the large networks in the United States.
[03:03:05.640 --> 03:03:10.640]  You have a cartel called MS, which stands for Mara Salvatrucha.
[03:03:10.640 --> 03:03:20.640]  And MS works closely with several Mexican cartels. And they are definitely very involved in the traffic.
[03:03:20.640 --> 03:03:26.640]  So let me ask you this question, because if Vladimir Putin can be proven to be involved, and that's a big deal, he's trying to fix corruption.
[03:03:26.640 --> 03:03:29.640]  Is there any evidence? Which side of things Vladimir Putin is on?
[03:03:29.640 --> 03:03:38.640]  No, I have not studied any. I have not read anything about Putin being involved in cartels that sell children.
[03:03:38.640 --> 03:03:43.640]  Whether he is or not, I can't I can't tell you yes or no, but I have not seen anything.
[03:03:43.640 --> 03:03:48.640]  What about the finders and stuff in the 80s? You know, the CIA has been directly connected to it.
[03:03:48.640 --> 03:03:59.640]  Well, look, I think this is what I I believe that there are men in very high places, such as was proven during my seven year research,
[03:03:59.640 --> 03:04:06.640]  who are involved in one way or another directly or indirectly, whether they're protecting a pedophile or they've tried it,
[03:04:06.640 --> 03:04:14.640]  or they're interested, they're there at every level, certainly at every socioeconomic level in every country.
[03:04:14.640 --> 03:04:18.640]  You have that you have that you have that in the United States, you have that in France, you have that in England,
[03:04:18.640 --> 03:04:25.640]  you have that in Switzerland, you have that in Spain and in Italy and everywhere else in China, Australia.
[03:04:25.640 --> 03:04:30.640]  So, you know, it exists. Pedophilia is a disease. As a matter of fact, there's a pharmaceutical,
[03:04:30.640 --> 03:04:36.640]  which I just found out a very interesting research is going on in Stockholm at the Karolinska Institute,
[03:04:36.640 --> 03:04:43.640]  where they're using a drug that is currently on the market for a different indication for prostate cancer.
[03:04:43.640 --> 03:04:45.640]  To block pedophilia behavior?
[03:04:45.640 --> 03:04:48.640]  Yeah, and what you know, they once they can fix somebody a ball pea hammer,
[03:04:48.640 --> 03:04:52.640]  10 or 15 times in the back of the head to that carries it. I want to talk to you very soon.
[03:04:52.640 --> 03:04:58.640]  I thank you, Conchita Sarnoff, for your courage. God bless you. You're an amazing lady.
[03:04:58.640 --> 03:05:00.640]  All watches coming up.
[03:05:29.640 --> 03:05:33.640]  Knows the military. Someone tested and ready to lead in a dangerous war.
[03:05:33.640 --> 03:05:38.640]  Oh, cool. She should answer. She said she would. Hello, we're under attack. The building's on fire.
[03:05:38.640 --> 03:05:41.640]  They're shooting at us. There's explosions.
[03:05:41.640 --> 03:05:48.640]  Where the f*** are you? You said you were going to answer. Come on, Secretary Clinton, we need you. Don't leave us.
[03:05:48.640 --> 03:05:54.640]  It's 3 a.m. and your children are safe and asleep. Who do you want answering the phone?
[03:05:54.640 --> 03:05:56.640]  What difference at this point does it make?
[03:05:56.640 --> 03:05:59.640]  I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message.
[03:06:27.640 --> 03:06:30.640]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[03:06:30.640 --> 03:06:37.640]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[03:06:37.640 --> 03:06:43.640]  which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[03:06:43.640 --> 03:06:45.640]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[03:06:45.640 --> 03:06:51.640]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[03:06:51.640 --> 03:07:00.640]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 Today at infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:07:00.640 --> 03:07:05.640]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:07:05.640 --> 03:07:13.640]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:07:13.640 --> 03:07:21.640]  60 years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:07:21.640 --> 03:07:26.640]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:07:26.640 --> 03:07:31.640]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[03:07:31.640 --> 03:07:35.640]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:07:35.640 --> 03:07:44.640]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs
[03:07:44.640 --> 03:07:50.640]  to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[03:07:50.640 --> 03:07:53.640]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[03:07:53.640 --> 03:08:09.640]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands, and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[03:08:09.640 --> 03:08:16.640]  You want answers? Well, so does me. It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:16.640 --> 03:08:22.640]  I covered a lot of the news the last three hours, but Paul Watson's about to take over from London, my great colleague.
[03:08:22.640 --> 03:08:25.640]  Look at the story on infowars.com. There's video.
[03:08:25.640 --> 03:08:28.640]  But Sunday Fox warns of war if Trump becomes president.
[03:08:28.640 --> 03:08:33.640]  Former Mexican president, don't play around with us. We can jump walls.
[03:08:33.640 --> 03:08:35.640]  He does videos flipping people off.
[03:08:35.640 --> 03:08:43.640]  Mexico has a big wall and a fence. One year to six months, hard labor. They torture people and find them,
[03:08:43.640 --> 03:08:46.640]  because they would be completely overrun if they did.
[03:08:46.640 --> 03:08:49.640]  As bad as Mexico is, Guatemala is even worse.
[03:08:49.640 --> 03:08:53.640]  It's just the ultimate hypocrisy, and then he knows the public's dumbed down,
[03:08:53.640 --> 03:08:56.640]  so he just flips everybody off and calls Trump's Porter drunk Americans.
[03:08:56.640 --> 03:09:01.640]  I'll give you that. Americans are some of the biggest consumers of alcohol in the world.
[03:09:01.640 --> 03:09:07.640]  You can argue who's tops, maybe Russians, the Poles, then Mexico, the U.S.
[03:09:07.640 --> 03:09:11.640]  I mean, Mexicans are in the top 10, the biggest drunks, Vicente.
[03:09:11.640 --> 03:09:14.640]  I mean, that's pot calling kettle black, bro. Yes, we're drunks.
[03:09:14.640 --> 03:09:19.640]  Okay, you got us. Now, look in the mirror. I think you may have us. You might actually have us.
[03:09:19.640 --> 03:09:22.640]  I'm not saying you're bad, but I think you may be even bigger drunks than us.
[03:09:22.640 --> 03:09:26.640]  I mean, out of a lot of drunks, I think the Mexicans are right up there at the top.
[03:09:26.640 --> 03:09:30.640]  So, you know, this is absolutely ridiculous.
[03:09:30.640 --> 03:09:34.640]  And then he makes an apology, and then he does all this. It's just all to get publicity.
[03:09:34.640 --> 03:09:37.640]  But Sunday Fox is very corrupt in my view. Just a total joke.
[03:09:37.640 --> 03:09:41.640]  And he tried to have me arrested. There was a video when I was bullhorning him.
[03:09:41.640 --> 03:09:44.640]  But under law, the Austin police wouldn't arrest me.
[03:09:44.640 --> 03:09:49.640]  And so that's some pretty classic video. Before it's a big conspiracy, I'm not in the Blues Brothers.
[03:09:49.640 --> 03:09:55.640]  And I'm not going to Chicago to take a gas and a pack of cigarettes and six pack of beer or whatever they say in the movie.
[03:09:55.640 --> 03:09:59.640]  I cut my eyes, swim in the stream, got some gravel in it.
[03:09:59.640 --> 03:10:03.640]  The light is very painful to it. And put a little silver in it.
[03:10:03.640 --> 03:10:06.640]  It looks like it's getting better. A little secondary infection.
[03:10:06.640 --> 03:10:10.640]  So I am doing that right now because this baby is not too happy in the light.
[03:10:10.640 --> 03:10:14.640]  My eyeball is like a vampire now. It's just sunlight is excruciating.
[03:10:14.640 --> 03:10:19.640]  And even these lights do not feel as if somebody is sticking their finger in my eye.
[03:10:19.640 --> 03:10:23.640]  Earlier, I was talking about child sex trafficking. And I wouldn't be wearing sunglasses on wearing that.
[03:10:23.640 --> 03:10:27.640]  People would be like, it's almost disrespectful in interviews. I went through the pain of it.
[03:10:27.640 --> 03:10:31.640]  But now that Paul Watson's here, I'm going to wear the Blues Brother attire.
[03:10:31.640 --> 03:10:34.640]  Those relaxing, you don't have as bright a light in my eyes. I'm kind of enjoying it.
[03:10:34.640 --> 03:10:36.640]  It's like a vacation from the TV lights.
[03:10:36.640 --> 03:10:43.640]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us here in a moment. Please don't forget that nowhere else are you going to hear somebody like Stefan Malinu
[03:10:43.640 --> 03:10:50.640]  and then Conchita Sarnoff exposing one of the first people to be exposing the whole Jeffrey Epstein, Epstein situation.
[03:10:50.640 --> 03:10:54.640]  Bill Clinton's pedophile reported island visits.
[03:10:54.640 --> 03:10:59.640]  He confirms he went to the pervert island with this guy.
[03:10:59.640 --> 03:11:03.640]  We will cover these issues. We will expose it. We will do it.
[03:11:03.640 --> 03:11:08.640]  And I can't think of a better place to spend your money, to spend your time spreading the word,
[03:11:08.640 --> 03:11:14.640]  to tell folks about InfoWars.com, to send people links to the podcast, the iPhone apps, the free droid apps, all of it,
[03:11:14.640 --> 03:11:20.640]  and to buy the products. I mean, X2 is a game changer. Most people are iodine deficient or the iodine in the food is bound.
[03:11:20.640 --> 03:11:24.640]  You're not absorbing it. Ours is totally pure. You actually absorb it.
[03:11:24.640 --> 03:11:31.640]  Things like our methylcobalamin that's the highest quality organic absorbable in your mouth so you actually absorb it.
[03:11:31.640 --> 03:11:35.640]  Most people can absorb it in their gut. You get like 3% of it. That's there.
[03:11:35.640 --> 03:11:39.640]  Anthroplex is back in stock. Our vitamin mineral fusion, great best seller.
[03:11:39.640 --> 03:11:42.640]  The first run sold out in a week and a half. It's back.

[03:13:23.640 --> 03:13:25.640]  They go, no, you can just buy their retail.

[03:13:32.640 --> 03:13:40.640]  Now, that said, drum roll please from Herbretanic Majesty's Island Fortress,
[03:13:40.640 --> 03:13:49.640]  Peer of the Realm, Paul Joseph Watson, Social Justice Warriors Nemesis Complete.
[03:13:49.640 --> 03:13:54.640]  Paul, did you realize that they've arrested that guy for the Hitler dog making fun of Hitler?
[03:13:54.640 --> 03:13:58.640]  Next, they're going to dig up, exhume Charlie Chaplin, and John Cleese is still alive,
[03:13:58.640 --> 03:14:00.640]  but he should be arrested, I agree with you.
[03:14:00.640 --> 03:14:04.640]  But did you know that I had four years ago done a Hitler dog and I'm actually waiting for the SWAT teams
[03:14:04.640 --> 03:14:12.640]  any moment like Darth Vader to blow the doors off the hinges and come in here rightfully and take me to prison?
[03:14:12.640 --> 03:14:15.640]  Have you seen Hitler dog? It's on InfoWars.com, Paul.
[03:14:15.640 --> 03:14:21.640]  I've seen it and it's hilarious like this video that this other individual made was hilarious,
[03:14:21.640 --> 03:14:29.640]  but we don't have the same rights as ISIS supporters who can walk around Westminster draped in ISIS flags
[03:14:29.640 --> 03:14:36.640]  chanting Alarack Bar. Some people have more equal rights than others, so if you make a joke video about a Nazi dog,
[03:14:36.640 --> 03:14:39.640]  and if you go and watch the full video, it's hilarious.
[03:14:39.640 --> 03:14:43.640]  And it got 1.1 million views. The vast majority of people loved it.
[03:14:43.640 --> 03:14:45.640]  The thumbs up were through the roof.
[03:14:45.640 --> 03:14:52.640]  And then of course, what happened was the Social Justice Warriors, the minority of perpetually offended morons,
[03:14:52.640 --> 03:14:56.640]  started the controversy via this mob outrage, which they always do.
[03:14:56.640 --> 03:15:02.640]  And for about two weeks, it was in the news, it was reported that this video was offensive,
[03:15:02.640 --> 03:15:06.640]  but he wasn't actually arrested by the police until a few days ago.
[03:15:06.640 --> 03:15:12.640]  So this was escalated. They actually took time to look at it and they went and arrested him, charged him with hate crimes.
[03:15:12.640 --> 03:15:17.640]  Well, I hope they arrest the dog too. It's obviously a Nazi. Look, right there's the proof.
[03:15:17.640 --> 03:15:19.640]  That is a cute problem, isn't it?
[03:15:19.640 --> 03:15:23.640]  Anyone who watched this video could see that it wasn't even malicious in any way.
[03:15:23.640 --> 03:15:29.640]  He made it to annoy his girlfriend. He had a little YouTube channel with like eight subscribers before this.
[03:15:29.640 --> 03:15:34.640]  You know, he's actually a left-wing communist. He's got hammer and sickle tattoos.
[03:15:34.640 --> 03:15:36.640]  He's not some Nazi white superman.
[03:15:36.640 --> 03:15:38.640]  Well, I wonder if he loves his leftist garbage now.
[03:15:38.640 --> 03:15:44.640]  Paul, I'm going to turn the time over to you. Great job from your Botanic Majesty's eagles nest. Take care.
[03:15:44.640 --> 03:15:48.640]  Okay, thanks Alex. Yeah, just to round up on that, we're not going to play the video again.
[03:15:48.640 --> 03:15:54.640]  I played it earlier. It's on my channel at YouTube if you want to get it and share it out if you actually care about free speech.
[03:15:54.640 --> 03:16:04.640]  Because I mean what I said in the video. I mean, it's getting to the point where I will not be able to do my job anymore and remain in the United Kingdom.
[03:16:04.640 --> 03:16:13.640]  Because if that is hate speech, which is what Scottish police are saying now constitutes hate speech, then my entire channel is hate speech.
[03:16:13.640 --> 03:16:25.640]  So I mean, this is the state of free speech in Britain. You know, we've got politicians who read out Winston Churchill quotes in public about what he said about Islam, you know, 60, 70 years ago.
[03:16:25.640 --> 03:16:34.640]  They get arrested for a breach of the peace. But you know, you can have radical Islamic preachers talking about how they want to execute homosexuals all day long.
[03:16:34.640 --> 03:16:39.640]  It's perfectly fine. They're given prime time spots on the BBC.
[03:16:39.640 --> 03:16:49.640]  To do that, as I said, people walking around Westminster and draped in ISIS flags, the police briefly talked to them for a couple of minutes and allow them to go on their way.
[03:16:49.640 --> 03:16:57.640]  But God forbid anyone would make a joke video about their dog, Sieg Heilig. Completely ridiculous.
[03:16:57.640 --> 03:17:04.640]  Again, he was arrested and charged with hate crimes. And it's not the first time that we've seen this from Scottish police.
[03:17:04.640 --> 03:17:09.640]  I don't know what it is with the police in Scotland, but they seem to be the worst for this.
[03:17:09.640 --> 03:17:13.640]  As I said in the video, they actually threatened a few weeks ago.
[03:17:13.640 --> 03:17:21.640]  It was actually on April the first to go out and perform home visits to anyone who made, quote, hurtful or inaccurate tweets.
[03:17:21.640 --> 03:17:27.640]  And everyone was like, oh, this is so ridiculous. It's so off the charts. It's obviously got to be an April fools joke.
[03:17:27.640 --> 03:17:35.640]  Right. No, it wasn't. They didn't delete the tweet. They didn't come back and say, yes, you're right. It was an April fools joke.
[03:17:35.640 --> 03:17:42.640]  That was a serious tweet. They actually threatened to home visit people for inaccurate tweets.
[03:17:42.640 --> 03:17:51.640]  And if that mirrors a story out of China today, that reminds me, this is at the global times China to launch platform to fight online rumors.
[03:17:51.640 --> 03:17:59.640]  China plans to launch a national whistleblower platform Thursday to crack down on online rumors and measure to further manage cyberspace.
[03:17:59.640 --> 03:18:06.640]  Sina Weibo, this is the Chinese version of Twitter, says that users accounts will be suspended if they are found spreading rumors.
[03:18:06.640 --> 03:18:10.640]  And you know, but by spreading rumors, they mean criticizing the government.
[03:18:10.640 --> 03:18:17.640]  The communist Chinese government shuts down entire areas of the Internet when there's civil unrest in certain areas.
[03:18:17.640 --> 03:18:24.640]  That's what Joe Lieberman wanted to see introduced in the US back in 2008 through cyber security bills.
[03:18:24.640 --> 03:18:30.640]  So now they say that in China, the police will quote handle these cases in accordance with laws and regulations.
[03:18:30.640 --> 03:18:39.640]  So they're talking about people who spread rumors on social media, i.e. criticize the government are going to get home visits by the police.
[03:18:39.640 --> 03:18:43.640]  Exactly the same thing that we now see in the United Kingdom.
[03:18:43.640 --> 03:18:57.640]  We are now aping the communist Chinese draconian Internet police state, the Great Firewall of China, in threatening home visits for people who make politically incorrect YouTube videos,
[03:18:57.640 --> 03:19:09.640]  which of course brings us full circle to the very reason that political correctness was created in communist countries in the first place, which was to censor and stifle dissent.
[03:19:09.640 --> 03:19:19.640]  Made by people who were critical of the state, the only thing that's changed now is it's people who are critical of the prevailing PC culture.
[03:19:19.640 --> 03:19:25.640]  You know, if you don't worship the gracious culturally enriching Muslims, then you're a hate criminal.
[03:19:25.640 --> 03:19:35.640]  Somebody actually reported me to the police back a few months ago for making a video saying that basically stoning women to death for being raped is a bad thing.
[03:19:35.640 --> 03:19:39.640]  You know, killing people who leave the religion of Islam isn't a bad thing.
[03:19:39.640 --> 03:19:43.640]  That according to that individual, that viewer was hate speech.
[03:19:43.640 --> 03:19:45.640]  I was reported to the police.
[03:19:45.640 --> 03:19:47.640]  Thankfully in that case, they didn't follow it up.
[03:19:47.640 --> 03:19:56.640]  And this is all being selectively enforced to chill free speech to make people petrified of expressing their opinion in the first place.
[03:19:56.640 --> 03:19:59.640]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones show live fourth hour overdrive.
[03:19:59.640 --> 03:20:00.640]  Don't go away.

[03:20:10.640 --> 03:20:14.640]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[03:20:14.640 --> 03:20:18.640]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[03:20:18.640 --> 03:20:20.640]  I said, let me see.
[03:20:20.640 --> 03:20:31.640]  Well, I took his pertinent and shot highly rated price competitive companies we represent and found one who pre approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.

[03:23:31.640 --> 03:23:36.640]  The jury found that Johnson & Johnson knew that these products could cause cancer and failed to warn consumers.

[03:24:19.640 --> 03:24:27.640]  We're going to play the rest of the exclusive Billy Corgan interview, so be sure to stay tuned for that.
[03:24:27.640 --> 03:24:32.640]  But here's an interesting story, media covering up Muslim migrant background of Munich knife attacker.
[03:24:32.640 --> 03:24:37.640]  Of course, we had this incident yesterday at a train station near the German city of Munich.
[03:24:37.640 --> 03:24:39.640]  Several people injured, one dead.
[03:24:39.640 --> 03:24:43.640]  The attacker reportedly, the first report said that he chanted,
[03:24:43.640 --> 03:24:49.640]  Allah Akbar during the rampage. Of course, that was what Manchester police had to apologize for saying.
[03:24:49.640 --> 03:24:52.640]  They incorporated that chant into their terror drill yesterday.
[03:24:52.640 --> 03:24:54.640]  Of course, that never happens.
[03:24:54.640 --> 03:25:01.640]  The vast array of Buddhist Christian suicide bombers make that not a likelihood that that would ever be chanted,
[03:25:01.640 --> 03:25:04.640]  but it was apparently chanted in Munich yesterday.
[03:25:04.640 --> 03:25:09.640]  And it seemed to be emerging that this was an Islamist motive,
[03:25:09.640 --> 03:25:17.640]  that Germany was finally starting to reap the whirlwind of importing 1.1 million Muslim migrants over the past year.
[03:25:17.640 --> 03:25:19.640]  And that narrative quickly changed.
[03:25:19.640 --> 03:25:25.640]  It was then reported that the assailant was in fact a mentally ill person with a drug problem,
[03:25:25.640 --> 03:25:33.640]  who was not a Muslim migrant, who was in fact an individual named Paul H, who was a German citizen.
[03:25:33.640 --> 03:25:39.640]  Well, now that narrative is being contradicted by German blogger von Marco Delgado,
[03:25:39.640 --> 03:25:45.640]  who asserts that the Paul H explanation is a cover-up and that the attacker's real name is Rafiq Yousef.
[03:25:45.640 --> 03:25:51.640]  Now, other people are saying that this Yousef character was actually killed by police back in September 2015,
[03:25:51.640 --> 03:25:54.640]  so we're still trying to confirm the full details of this.
[03:25:54.640 --> 03:25:58.640]  This blogger said that he spoke to police sources,
[03:25:58.640 --> 03:26:05.640]  who said that this Paul H individual that was being named in media reports was not a name that was on their list.
[03:26:05.640 --> 03:26:10.640]  The police had not identified an individual by that name as being the attacker,
[03:26:10.640 --> 03:26:19.640]  and in fact they said that the explanation that this knife man was in fact a Muslim migrant was still very much open.
[03:26:19.640 --> 03:26:23.640]  So we saw immediately after the Paris attacks, as we reported at the time,
[03:26:23.640 --> 03:26:29.640]  because we had that incident during the, or just before the Germany, Netherlands soccer game,
[03:26:29.640 --> 03:26:35.640]  where they cancelled the game, evacuated everybody from the stadium because of a supposed bomb threat.
[03:26:35.640 --> 03:26:38.640]  Immediately afterwards, the German government came out and said,
[03:26:38.640 --> 03:26:42.640]  no, nothing happened, there was no bomb threat whatsoever.
[03:26:42.640 --> 03:26:51.640]  But then it came out in German media that a paramedic and police officers actually witnessed the explosives inside this fake ambulance
[03:26:51.640 --> 03:26:54.640]  and were, quote, told not to talk about it.
[03:26:54.640 --> 03:27:00.640]  So the German authorities have previous, when it comes to covering up terror attacks,
[03:27:00.640 --> 03:27:09.640]  to hide the fact that the assailant, the attacker, is in fact one of the Muslim migrants that they've been imposing for the past year.
[03:27:09.640 --> 03:27:17.640]  Again, Cologne police on New Year's Eve, the night of the mass molestation, were told to cover it up.
[03:27:17.640 --> 03:27:25.640]  And it was confirmed, in fact, a couple of weeks ago that they were even ordered to remove the word rape from their initial report.
[03:27:25.640 --> 03:27:33.640]  We've had other reports where police have been ordered to clamp down to high details of Muslim migrants being involved in rape,
[03:27:33.640 --> 03:27:37.640]  so as not to quote, legitimize critics of mass migration.
[03:27:37.640 --> 03:27:44.640]  We have Germany's top broadcaster, ZDF, refusing to run crime stories about Muslim rape suspects,
[03:27:44.640 --> 03:27:51.640]  because in the words of their editor-in-chief, they don't want to inflame the situation and spread the bad mood that migrants don't deserve it.
[03:27:51.640 --> 03:27:59.640]  So in every other previous case in Germany, we've seen a deliberate attempt to cover up these rapes, these attempted terror attacks,
[03:27:59.640 --> 03:28:08.640]  again, to defend that narrative that Germany is under threat from these waves of, in many cases, radicals that are coming into the country.
[03:28:08.640 --> 03:28:13.640]  And we could have seen that once again with the attack in Munich yesterday.
[03:28:13.640 --> 03:28:19.640]  Alex mentioned it. We're going to go to the clip now. Here's Vicente Fox, the former Mexican president, saying that,
[03:28:19.640 --> 03:28:26.640]  Mexico could go to war with the United States over Donald Trump's offensive comments. Here's the clip.
[03:28:26.640 --> 03:28:33.640]  In this world's messages of hate, what's going to happen in the middle list?
[03:28:33.640 --> 03:28:42.640]  We're coming back to the era of the ugly American, which was, the gringo was hated all around the world.
[03:28:42.640 --> 03:28:53.640]  And this guy, pretty soon, he got the title now. He is the ugly American. He is the hated gringo, because he's attacking all of us.
[03:28:53.640 --> 03:28:59.640]  He's offending all of us. Imagine, I mean, that could take us to a war, not to a trade war.
[03:28:59.640 --> 03:29:05.640]  It could take us, oh, of course. I mean, I can tell you, in Mexico, we have a saying.
[03:29:05.640 --> 03:29:12.640]  Okay, we are chiquitos. We're small, but we're picosos. We're like the jalapeno.
[03:29:12.640 --> 03:29:21.640]  So don't play around with that. We can jump walls, we can swim rivers, and we can defend ourselves.
[03:29:21.640 --> 03:29:26.640]  So there's the former president of Mexico. And these comments were not really picked up by the media.
[03:29:26.640 --> 03:29:31.640]  They glossed over it and focused on him using the word gringo to describe Trump.
[03:29:31.640 --> 03:29:40.640]  Actually, not only warning, you could say threatening an actual conflict, a war with the United States, all over Donald Trump's offensive rhetoric.
[03:29:40.640 --> 03:29:47.640]  How ludicrous is that, that Fox would go to that level of hyperball simply to denounce Donald Trump.
[03:29:47.640 --> 03:29:50.640]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show live after the break. Stay tuned.
[03:29:50.640 --> 03:30:01.640]  On March, the Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:21.640 --> 03:30:29.640]  But maybe you don't have a Hollywood mansion where you can drop another million dollars to turn your home theater into a radiation-proof bunker.
[03:30:29.640 --> 03:30:33.640]  There are still very effective low-tech, low-cost things you can do to prepare.
[03:30:33.640 --> 03:30:41.640]  In fact, even realizing that there's a need to prepare and doing anything to act on that realization increases your chances of survival.
[03:30:41.640 --> 03:30:49.640]  Things that you do to prepare for an Armageddon scenario will help you to weather storms, to absorb an economic shock, or to protect you from home invasion.
[03:30:49.640 --> 03:30:55.640]  Prepare for the worst-case scenario while you educate yourself and others and work for the best-case scenario.

[03:33:32.640 --> 03:33:46.640]  again emphasizing the importance of this annual confab. And of course, her attendance has united both left and right in Germany who are decrying this, saying that she will be at the mercy of lobbyists.

[03:34:48.640 --> 03:34:59.640]  Now we're going to finish off this exclusive Billy Corgan interview. Laying the smackdown on the social justice warriors is the remainder of that interview.
[03:34:59.640 --> 03:35:08.640]  I'm the type of person. I saw that report. I was fascinated by it. I actually went to the women's Twitter account and I read a bunch of her tweets.
[03:35:08.640 --> 03:35:16.640]  Because as somebody in public life, I know not to just take your word for it. I wanted to see for myself what is the messaging, what is the perspective.
[03:35:16.640 --> 03:35:21.640]  Maybe she said one dumb thing and she said 10 things that were really wise. I want to learn.
[03:35:21.640 --> 03:35:29.640]  So if you can bring that into a wider frame, I think that's very, very helpful to people to encourage investigation and not just take it.
[03:35:29.640 --> 03:35:37.640]  Because at the end of the day, if this is propaganda one and they say you're just propaganda two, then it's always going to be an argument who's got the moral high ground.
[03:35:37.640 --> 03:35:41.640]  Right. And we definitely see that in the comment section, that people are like, oh, well, this is that.
[03:35:41.640 --> 03:35:51.640]  Leanne, you're a privileged white woman. You have no right to say that. So by engaging in the wider topic of free speech, libertarianism,
[03:35:51.640 --> 03:36:02.640]  supporting values which you don't agree with, but at the same time sort of calling you for what it is, you can engage without having to shut it down.
[03:36:02.640 --> 03:36:12.640]  Right now we have like a whole movement in the youth. These people truly feel this is their civil rights movement of their time and they feel like they're on the right.
[03:36:12.640 --> 03:36:21.640]  And so if you, for instance, if it's a Trump anti-Trump rally, they think that people on the Trump side are just racist, homophobic, xenophobic, shut it down.
[03:36:21.640 --> 03:36:28.640]  I don't want to hear anything you say because I'm on the right side of history here and I don't even need to hear your facts.
[03:36:28.640 --> 03:36:38.640]  And so how do you kind of educate these people that possibly their ideas aren't authentically individual?
[03:36:38.640 --> 03:36:46.640]  My argument is you can't. They're too far gone. And that makes some pessimistic because I know that you're, you want a solution-based concept.
[03:36:46.640 --> 03:36:57.640]  I think when somebody reaches the point where they literally cannot see a human being on the other side of the argument, and I'm not even talking about religion.
[03:36:57.640 --> 03:37:09.640]  Okay, I'm talking about humanism. The law, as it's constructed in Western civilization, is based on the idea that a human has a sort of sovereign right to exist.
[03:37:09.640 --> 03:37:16.640]  And of course people argue about when that life begins. That's a different subject. But the point is this sovereign right has a vote.
[03:37:16.640 --> 03:37:21.640]  They have a life and they have a right to live it pursuit of, and then we obviously have a different idea in America.
[03:37:21.640 --> 03:37:28.640]  So when somebody has reached the point where they literally do not see that person as a voice of vote and they have a story and they have a family.
[03:37:28.640 --> 03:37:38.640]  Look, I've said it before. I grew up around a lot of racists in my family. Would I call them bad people? No. Would I call them misinformed? Yeah.
[03:37:38.640 --> 03:37:55.640]  Was that due to experience? Do they have a right to their belief? They would argue that they had a right to their belief because something happened in 1984 and they had some guy from a different race say something and they were never going to listen to that race again and anything to do.
[03:37:55.640 --> 03:38:06.640]  Okay, that's racist as I would define it. When you reach a point where that person cannot even respect that person across them's path to arrive at a particular point,
[03:38:06.640 --> 03:38:14.640]  then what's the discussion about? You have no right. So you're talking about disenfranchising. There's no discussion.
[03:38:14.640 --> 03:38:21.640]  Their tactics in the social justice worry movement are to stifle and shut down free speech.
[03:38:21.640 --> 03:38:30.640]  And I would argue in the world that I live in, which is the bare knuckle world, they're leveraging their position because they don't have power.
[03:38:30.640 --> 03:38:36.640]  Now, of course, their argument is that they've been systemically disenfranchised by systems, right?
[03:38:36.640 --> 03:38:40.640]  Pick your poison on that. They might even have an argument.
[03:38:40.640 --> 03:38:50.640]  Okay, but at the end of the day, if you don't recognize the leverage that they're using, you ultimately come back to the same conclusion, which is they don't have power because they are not on the moral high ground.
[03:38:50.640 --> 03:39:03.640]  The moral high ground would be, I want to engage you because ultimately I believe that my argument will win over your argument or I will place something in your heart like the mustard seed like Jesus talked about that will grow and make you realize the air of your ways.
[03:39:03.640 --> 03:39:12.640]  That is not what this is about. It is to shut you down, leverage a minority position. I'm not using the word minority in a racial pejorative way.
[03:39:12.640 --> 03:39:18.640]  I'm talking about groups that statistically don't have leverage to just vote their way through.
[03:39:18.640 --> 03:39:33.640]  How do we kind of see through that knowing like, okay, this is a kind of an evolutionary step that we as humans need to take versus, okay, now I'm being told that this is what I'm being conditioned to accept socialism.
[03:39:33.640 --> 03:39:42.640]  I think if you're curious, you have to start by separating the truth. I think admitting to yourself your own truth is always a good place to start.
[03:39:42.640 --> 03:39:49.640]  Like when I watch some of the clips that you guys have been putting up at some of these protests, I have no respect for what these people are doing. I don't.
[03:39:49.640 --> 03:40:00.640]  They're shutting down free speech. They're shutting down processes that I just don't get it. To me, it's antithetical to the society that I believe in.
[03:40:00.640 --> 03:40:08.640]  And as I said on Alex's show, they're eventually going to come after me. It's just the way history works, okay?
[03:40:08.640 --> 03:40:17.640]  But, dot, dot, dot, I try to listen to their argument. And where I do recognize the argument is having merit, I try to consider it.
[03:40:17.640 --> 03:40:24.640]  And then I try to think into terms of practical application. In essence, don't become them. Don't shut your ears.
[03:40:24.640 --> 03:40:37.640]  Okay. Try to understand the forces at play. It's hard to tell someone who feels disenfranchised by the system or the, you know, the government or whatever the world they live in.
[03:40:37.640 --> 03:40:46.640]  You try to tell someone here who, you know, you might argue is taking advantage of our social welfare system or gaming the system somehow.
[03:40:46.640 --> 03:40:55.640]  And say, look, you haven't, and you're telling me America sucks and you're spitting on the flag. Try go live in one of these third world countries and see how far that gets you.
[03:40:55.640 --> 03:41:06.640]  You know, it's always very interesting to me, and this is a very prickly point to make. It's very interesting to me when you see the way gays and lesbians are treated.
[03:41:06.640 --> 03:41:17.640]  In some other countries in the world, the level of, if they have that level of vitriol for, let's say, Donald Trump as a candidate, because they feel it's antithetical to what they believe in,
[03:41:17.640 --> 03:41:28.640]  where's the five times greater condemnation for those societies that are treating their people far worse than just words and ideas?
[03:41:28.640 --> 03:41:36.640]  I mean, it's always interesting to me that how people kind of pick their spots. That always brings a, it's like a red flag for me.
[03:41:36.640 --> 03:41:46.640]  That means they're really not in it at the real level. And then you start realizing, look, most people are trendy, right? Most people are trendy.
[03:41:46.640 --> 03:41:53.640]  For every five hardcore people that are there, they're spitting in your face. There's 50 people there just doing the, they just want to be a part of the scene.
[03:41:53.640 --> 03:41:59.640]  Yeah. Yeah. You, you know, racist, you know, it's like, they wouldn't even know what it means.
[03:41:59.640 --> 03:42:12.640]  What do you think about that? That we have people wanting to take away what makes this country so great and gives them the right and the freedom to go out there and say whatever they want,
[03:42:12.640 --> 03:42:22.640]  and they want to now chip away at free speech, trying to say, well, it's offensive. And so should offensive speech, should you be allowed to do it?
[03:42:22.640 --> 03:42:25.640]  You know, not everyone's offended by speech. So how do you?
[03:42:25.640 --> 03:42:33.640]  That's a fantastic question. And I'm going to say something that I think is probably the most important thing to me and everything that we're talking about.
[03:42:33.640 --> 03:42:41.640]  We all remember the cartoon, you know, Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam or whatever, and draws the line. You don't step over that line.
[03:42:41.640 --> 03:42:48.640]  He steps over the line and he draws another line and right. Okay. For me personally, we're at the last line.
[03:42:48.640 --> 03:42:57.640]  Free speech is the last line. So if you're saying to me, look, what's more important?
[03:42:57.640 --> 03:43:07.640]  Identifying with social movements that do have valid and real concerns as they see it from their own perspective and community.
[03:43:07.640 --> 03:43:15.640]  In essence, their voice does need to be heard and respected, even if at the end of the day you don't agree.
[03:43:15.640 --> 03:43:25.640]  Okay. If that can be done while maintaining free speech in essence, we're kind of a rolling linus ball of dust and we're just moving forward as civilizations do great.
[03:43:25.640 --> 03:43:34.640]  I'm more than happy to have that discussion. I'm more than happy to have that discussion with politicos, people in entertainment business, social justice warriors.
[03:43:34.640 --> 03:43:41.640]  And I've had these discussions through the years with, I mean, when I when I talked about God in the 90s in my songs, you know, the right wing preachers came at me.
[03:43:41.640 --> 03:43:47.640]  I was one of my proudest moments as I was a picketed in the last year by the Westboro. Yeah.
[03:43:47.640 --> 03:43:52.640]  I was like, wow, badge of honor. This is awesome. You know, I mean, I'm actually still dangerous, right?
[03:43:52.640 --> 03:44:03.640]  Okay. To me, and I hope this makes sense because I'm rambling a bit, but the free speech line without free speech, none of those arguments matter.
[03:44:03.640 --> 03:44:04.640]  Right.
[03:44:04.640 --> 03:44:15.640]  Not a one. Because once we lose that, there's no end. And I'm sorry if you're a student in history and I've read plenty of books, you name it.
[03:44:15.640 --> 03:44:28.640]  If you've ever seen the killing fields about Pol Pot and, you know, the K. Mer Rouge, you know, what Stalin did, you know, obviously what Hitler did, any socialist system, which tend to be left by the way, just a little point in there.
[03:44:28.640 --> 03:44:40.640]  Once you cross that line, okay, you look at every top to tolerance regime in the in the last hundred and something years, who they kill first, they kill the disabled, and who they kill next, they kill the artists.
[03:44:40.640 --> 03:44:48.640]  Okay. Why are ideas, as John Lennon once saying, imagine, why are ideas so powerful because they are.
[03:44:48.640 --> 03:44:56.640]  They're the thing that cannot be defended against an idea, a whisper, a rumor cannot be no wall can stop the truth.
[03:44:56.640 --> 03:45:06.640]  Right. So, no matter what side you're on, left, right, libertarian, you lose the free speech lane, it's over.
[03:45:06.640 --> 03:45:14.640]  Because we all lose every one of us. And I don't care who you are, where you come from, where you're at on the wheel.
[03:45:14.640 --> 03:45:29.640]  Okay, which why is which does explain sort of in the in the greater zeitgeist of the idea, why the mega wealthy and the elites are preparing to go off grid off planet, buying lots of land in Costa Rica or BC and all that stuff, because
[03:45:29.640 --> 03:45:34.640]  they got the quarterback read and they see when that fur goes, it's going to fly.
[03:45:34.640 --> 03:45:40.640]  Yeah, we don't want to get there. That's my point. Once we lose that lane of free speech in this country, it's over.
[03:45:40.640 --> 03:45:52.640]  It might still be called America, but it is over. So I don't care what your trendy argument, I don't care what your hashtag argument is, if you do not stand for free speech, you do not stand for America.
[03:45:52.640 --> 03:45:58.640]  That means you want something else. And if you think you're something else is going to be better than America, I'm here to tell you you're wrong.
[03:45:58.640 --> 03:46:06.640]  And I will fight that fight to my dying breath. Because look, I was propagandized as a kid to believe that everything America did was great.
[03:46:06.640 --> 03:46:12.640]  And like a lot of people as I got into the world in the seventies and eighties, I realized that wasn't true.
[03:46:12.640 --> 03:46:17.640]  America has done plenty of horrible things. Start with the Native Americans and work your way backwards.
[03:46:17.640 --> 03:46:24.640]  So I'm no, you know, America is perfect, you know, I I've never believed that nor did my father.
[03:46:24.640 --> 03:46:30.640]  But I do believe America is better than any other political and social system that's ever been created in the world.
[03:46:30.640 --> 03:46:39.640]  That proved me wrong. I'm willing to listen. But we're Americans. We love our country. And if you're a true American, you even love the enemy.
[03:46:39.640 --> 03:46:47.640]  Right. So we can cry and laugh and and shake our heads at the social justice warriors. True Americans and libertarians want them in that system.
[03:46:47.640 --> 03:46:58.640]  Let's have that argument. Well, and on that note, so with the social media is kind of the the engine where a lot of these social justice movements is kind of gaining momentum.
[03:46:58.640 --> 03:47:09.640]  But it's also where they're being sort of corralled and controlled as well so they can take your free speech and hide that line of code.
[03:47:09.640 --> 03:47:15.640]  So it never trends or the algorithms will just shut down and you won't be able to reach your audience.
[03:47:15.640 --> 03:47:31.640]  And so talk to people a little bit about how to use these systems for for good or to use, you know, vote with your dollars or your feet, so to speak, to not allow them to start controlling us because they they truly are.
[03:47:31.640 --> 03:47:45.640]  A lot of my friends are what I would call quantifies average Americans is my family. What do they do at a participatory level to either encourage or discourage things that they don't agree with.
[03:47:45.640 --> 03:47:58.640]  And I think it takes a little bit more savvy if we're in the info or it takes a little bit more savvy to know how to get into those systems in a way that we can leverage our own position, just like the social justice warriors do.
[03:47:58.640 --> 03:48:05.640]  But at the same time not resort to the kind of the scummi part of it all, which is sort of leading people astray.
[03:48:05.640 --> 03:48:11.640]  Look, when you use the word liberty, most people don't find that word sexy.
[03:48:11.640 --> 03:48:23.640]  Racist has a lot more to it than libertarian libertarian sounds like you're stuck in the back of a truck with Ron Paul and he's talking to you about like, you know, free policy papers and freedom.
[03:48:23.640 --> 03:48:29.640]  It doesn't sound very exciting to me. Okay. You know, I tend to like the social argument.
[03:48:29.640 --> 03:48:39.640]  You have to start this with my argument. You have to start by identifying that the most powerful thing in the world right now are these technocratic systems that are in place.
[03:48:39.640 --> 03:48:52.640]  Search engines, the way we connect on these on these social platforms, governments have either encouraged these things to come along or quickly realizes that they were the new element arms of control.
[03:48:52.640 --> 03:48:57.640]  And so you have to ask yourself whether your participation in these systems is actually enslaving you.
[03:48:57.640 --> 03:49:09.640]  Then you have to drill down a little further and you have to want to ask questions about if what you're doing and participating in is truly as open as it seems.
[03:49:09.640 --> 03:49:23.640]  So if Twitter, for example, is full of people of a diversity of opinions and you feel like, hey, it's capitalist. It's my idea versus yours. Who tweets more? Who gets more retweets? Who says the right incendiary thing? Who does the right mean? Great.
[03:49:23.640 --> 03:49:32.640]  That's America. Great. And I would only argue, you know, where do you cross the line? And you see it all the time. I mean, InfoWorst puts up articles.
[03:49:32.640 --> 03:49:41.640]  As somebody who's in the in the world and I have to watch what I say, when you see a page that's literally in the pages, the Facebook pages assassinate Donald Trump.
[03:49:41.640 --> 03:49:52.640]  And I believe Facebook comes out and says that doesn't violate our standards and practices. Okay, that's where somebody like myself has to ask is my participation in the Facebook system.
[03:49:52.640 --> 03:49:57.640]  And I would call it a system. Am I actually encouraging something which as an American, I find offensive.
[03:49:57.640 --> 03:50:05.640]  And I also find it offensive that a business would support. You can call. I would have no problem with the page that said Donald Trump's a racist.
[03:50:05.640 --> 03:50:16.640]  Donald Trump's a homophobe because because that's just opinion. The minute you talk about killing someone. Sorry, that's where you need to step in as a business.
[03:50:16.640 --> 03:50:26.640]  I will not support that. So why is that? Why is that okay? But you can imagine what page you could create on Facebook today and there would be calls for you to never work here at InfoWorst ever again.
[03:50:26.640 --> 03:50:40.640]  Right. That's where it gets funky. So you have to be sophisticated enough to look at those systems and say, is my participation encouraging something that I know deep down is intrinsically not only flawed, but counterintuitive to what I want to be part of.
[03:50:40.640 --> 03:50:51.640]  In essence, your participation is condomin. Now, I run a business. I have a Facebook page. I need the Facebook page at this day to run my business. It's an effective system.
[03:50:51.640 --> 03:51:05.640]  I don't like everything. So that's just another piece of information that may ultimately push me off Facebook. And I'm willing to take the commercial and public hit of not having that reach that I have to the 4 million plus people that follow us on Facebook.
[03:51:05.640 --> 03:51:15.640]  Because at the end of the day, I as an American can't support that. So does it bother me? Yes. Do I have to have the argument in my head? Yes. To this point, I haven't made that decision.
[03:51:15.640 --> 03:51:25.640]  If you're not having that argument in your own head, then you're not participating. And then to use Alex's term, you're just a drone who's just falling around. You're pretending you have no influence and you do.
[03:51:25.640 --> 03:51:44.640]  And I think too, it's really time for a lot of us who are libertarians and who are for freedom and who are concerned and who do we're not kind of in the trance. We do see, we do need to start coming together and working and setting up our own systems to counteract their systems that they have.
[03:51:44.640 --> 03:51:54.640]  That's why we use the word empowerment. Empowering people with, let's not call it the facts and the truth. The facts and the truth are always kind of ephemeral, this eye of the beholder stuff.
[03:51:54.640 --> 03:52:00.640]  Empowering people to have a better range of decision making as far as how they approach their social systems. I think that's powerful.
[03:52:00.640 --> 03:52:14.640]  Then if you take the extra step and you say like maybe info war sets up its own version of social media so that like minded businesses are able to participate in a system that is ultimately holistic to the ideas that you would believe in.
[03:52:14.640 --> 03:52:27.640]  Some open source social media networks as well. I think those days are coming soon. And trust me, if 20% of people suddenly jumped off Facebook, they would notice. They look at those numbers every day.
[03:52:27.640 --> 03:52:30.640]  Just like I would notice if suddenly there were 20% empty seats.
[03:52:30.640 --> 03:52:45.640]  Well, it's like you have these huge groups like the Soros backed groups there that they've all joined together now. All these little minority movements, they've all decided to come together and now they are a smaller majority movement.
[03:52:45.640 --> 03:52:49.640]  And so people are, you know, you got to understand what you're up against with these machines.
[03:52:49.640 --> 03:53:01.640]  Again, from a capitalist free market position, I don't have any problem with that. If seven independent hot dog stands band together to form a hot dog association because they need to leverage to position the market, great.
[03:53:01.640 --> 03:53:11.640]  They should have the right to do that. The thing you know though, and you know it and you can know it in your heart and I'm going to say it right to the camera, they will all turn on each other.
[03:53:11.640 --> 03:53:13.640]  The left always eats its own.
[03:53:13.640 --> 03:53:20.640]  And the minute they gain what they want, they'll turn on each other because they're rapacious and they can't help themselves.
[03:53:20.640 --> 03:53:29.640]  They have to have a cause. Their identity is born of the cause. There was a great article that came out when the gay marriage, the Supreme Court, all that stuff.
[03:53:29.640 --> 03:53:32.640]  Okay, gay marriage is now part of law of the land.
[03:53:32.640 --> 03:53:39.640]  Okay, there were articles about people being depressed because the movement was over. They'd won.
[03:53:39.640 --> 03:53:45.640]  You know, if that was your argument and you wanted it and you got it, great. That's an incredible victory if that's the side you're on.
[03:53:45.640 --> 03:53:53.640]  And having grown up and watched people die of AIDS and being part of that in my own particular way, I thought, good, great. You got what you wanted.
[03:53:53.640 --> 03:54:02.640]  Got to go on to the next thing because it was about the identity of waving that particular flag. The victory was not in the thing. The victory was in the march.
[03:54:02.640 --> 03:54:04.640]  Yeah, being a part of that big movement.
[03:54:04.640 --> 03:54:13.640]  So understand a lot of these trendies, the minute the thing gets boring or it gets too hard or it breaks down into policy, social movements are easy to begin.
[03:54:13.640 --> 03:54:26.640]  You know, you're being disenfranchised. Yeah, your vote counts. Yeah, when you get to the level of policy and regulation and sitting like I have at the local civic board meeting for four hours and they're talking about water mains.
[03:54:26.640 --> 03:54:31.640]  That's where most people, that's where the trendy stuff stops. Yeah, they'll tap out and or they'll turn on each other.
[03:54:31.640 --> 03:54:40.640]  But at least in your own heart, when you watch them abusing info wars reporters, no, they can't look in 20 years and see where they're at.
[03:54:40.640 --> 03:54:56.640]  They won't be, they won't be still twizzling the New Year's toy, guarantee. Right. Yeah, well, that's why a lot of people point out how, for instance, Bernie Sanders isn't really reaching a lot of people that are 30 and up or even 40 and up because it's a lot of just young people that don't necessarily have the experience.
[03:54:56.640 --> 03:55:07.640]  46% of Americans don't pay any form of tax, at least in terms of federal or state. Of course, free stuff. Great. Give me more free stuff. Yeah, sounds good. Sounds good to me.
[03:55:07.640 --> 03:55:20.640]  No freedom. That's fine for Bernie. I want more free stuff. Yeah, exactly. Well, Billy, thank you so much for joining us in the studio. This is kind of the first of a series of social cultural breakdown.
[03:55:20.640 --> 03:55:27.640]  The beginning of your own personal revolution. Yes, indeed, our individual, true individual ideas. Well, thank you so much.
[03:55:27.640 --> 03:55:53.640]  Thank you.
[03:55:53.640 --> 03:56:03.640]  Thank you.
[03:56:03.640 --> 03:56:30.640]  Thank you.
[03:56:30.640 --> 03:56:38.640]  Thank you.
[03:57:01.640 --> 03:57:29.640]  Thank you.
[03:57:29.640 --> 03:57:58.640]  Thank you.
[03:57:58.640 --> 03:58:09.640]  Hillary is basically becoming Jeb 2.0. I mean, Jeb had a ton of money behind him. He had the full backing of the establishment and he collapsed almost imminently.
[03:58:09.640 --> 03:58:17.640]  He collapsed. He was ran over. He was derided by Trump. He completely, he was decimated and that's what's happening to Hillary Clinton.
[03:58:17.640 --> 03:58:30.640]  We see her poems at West Virginia. Again, absolutely pathetic. She's going to be Jeb 2.0 by the looks of it. And Trump is increasingly looking like he will cross her in the general election.
[03:58:30.640 --> 03:58:38.640]  So those predictions aren't looking so insane anymore. That's going to wrap it up for the show. Infowars Nightly News coming up tonight. Alex will be back 11 to 2 tomorrow.
