[00:01:09.292 --> 00:01:14.214]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, July 14th.
[00:01:14.214 --> 00:01:16.014]  We're 111 days out from the election.
[00:01:16.014 --> 00:01:19.435]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:01:19.435 --> 00:01:34.120]  Roger Stone would have given us the exclusive yesterday, as he promised me to do, but he had to get clearance and had to get the clemency letter first and had to check with his probation officer, so he gave it to Hannity.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.600]  That's fine.
[00:01:35.711 --> 00:01:39.874]  I'm glad he's at least out there and able to speak in this so-called free country.
[00:01:39.874 --> 00:01:44.518]  But he will be joining us in the second hour today.
[00:01:44.518 --> 00:01:47.321]  And he has so many Skype problems at home in his apartment.
[00:01:47.321 --> 00:01:50.343]  He's going to a law office of his lawyer to be able to do it.
[00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:52.545]  And he's got a lot to cover.
[00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:57.089]  So believe me, you don't want to miss the second hour of the transmission today.
[00:01:59.338 --> 00:02:04.182]  Also, Joe Hoff, Jim Hoff's brother, who lived in Hong Kong, has now moved back to the U.S.
[00:02:04.182 --> 00:02:12.288]  He'll be joining us, he's a statistician executive, to go over the incredible numbers of the bait-and-switch shell game that is COVID-19.
[00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.532]  Now, as I told you, they were always planning lockdown 2.0 using fraudulent statistics.
[00:02:18.532 --> 00:02:21.594]  And I told you California would lead the way, locking down again.
[00:02:21.594 --> 00:02:22.735]  They've now done it.
[00:02:22.735 --> 00:02:25.396]  Austin will announce either today or tomorrow.
[00:02:25.396 --> 00:02:30.420]  I have sources inside the APD and sources inside the City Council.
[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.564]  They will announce lockdown as of yesterday, either this afternoon or tomorrow.
[00:02:37.564 --> 00:02:39.606]  There was a debate whether it would be done Tuesday, Wednesday.
[00:02:40.956 --> 00:02:49.522]  At the latest Friday, but the mayor's set to pull the trigger because it's all WHO, UN directives for the NIH.
[00:02:49.522 --> 00:03:00.910]  And I get all these emails from companies and from, you know, homeowners associations, everything about how we follow the WHO guidelines, why I just woke up and I'm under UN control.
[00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.512]  So there's that incredible stack of news and developments.
[00:03:04.512 --> 00:03:08.235]  Remember a few months ago they had Media Matters articles that's run by George Soros and
[00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:11.332]  Others saying it's preposterous.
[00:03:11.332 --> 00:03:12.993]  George Soros doesn't fund BLM.
[00:03:12.993 --> 00:03:14.795]  George Soros doesn't fund Antifa.
[00:03:14.795 --> 00:03:20.318]  It's the same organization fighting fascism.
[00:03:20.318 --> 00:03:21.579]  Rise up all these groups.
[00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:31.466]  Soros Foundation, refuse fascism, announces it is doubling down on funding black-led justice organizations.
[00:03:31.466 --> 00:03:34.828]  That means the front for the looting, the killing, the murder.
[00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:37.812]  What a true ghoul.
[00:03:37.812 --> 00:03:43.436]  You know, he could, in that 1990s remake of Dracula, he wouldn't need any makeup to play the part of Dracula.
[00:03:43.436 --> 00:03:48.660]  He looks just like the Dracula character in that Keanu Reeves movie.
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:55.826]  So that's all coming up today, and more police officers executed, more innocent white people executed, and the media actually celebrates.
[00:03:55.826 --> 00:03:57.407]  They're like, kill that white bitch!
[00:03:59.298 --> 00:04:00.319]  Oh, poor white people!
[00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.543]  I mean, this is true French Revolution insanity.
[00:04:05.543 --> 00:04:07.784]  Black cops are getting killed, people are celebrating that.
[00:04:07.784 --> 00:04:13.849]  I mean, this is foreign governments, the bureaucrats, the megabanks, the establishment, the man!
[00:04:15.205 --> 00:04:19.768]  Is trying to create a global depression and shut down America to punish us.
[00:04:19.768 --> 00:04:23.530]  And they're bragging the establishment runs it and all the media is behind it.
[00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:31.754]  And the average meth head and if a person really believes they're out fighting for the people.
[00:04:31.754 --> 00:04:34.416]  No, they know they're green lit by the establishment.
[00:04:34.416 --> 00:04:38.998]  And so all these cowards are getting together in gangs and attacking and going crazy.
[00:04:38.998 --> 00:04:41.520]  On airplanes, on trains, just everywhere.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.781]  They're getting more and more insane.
[00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.432]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:46.432 --> 00:04:47.633]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:47.633 --> 00:04:52.938]  The websites are newswars.com, infowars.com, and band.video.
[00:04:52.938 --> 00:04:55.521]  And Paul Watson's site is summit.news.
[00:04:55.521 --> 00:04:56.002]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.535 --> 00:05:10.862]  The bad news is Western governments have totally let multinational big tech bring in communist Chinese style total net surveillance censorship with AI.
[00:05:10.862 --> 00:05:15.566]  The good news is they had to do that to carry out this world government COVID takeover.
[00:05:16.246 --> 00:05:24.610]  This planetary corporate reset that COVID covers for, because the truth is powerful and will defeat them and will smash them.
[00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:44.500]  And the good news is there's still sites like band.video, newswars.com, infowars.com, paulwatsonsitesummit.news, and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive traffic thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen, that is the master of our own
[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.161]  Destinies.
[00:05:46.161 --> 00:05:53.107]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality, a war on civilization, a war on our health, a war on our economy.
[00:05:53.107 --> 00:05:57.611]  But being aware of it, and standing up to it, and speaking out against it, will defeat it.
[00:05:57.611 --> 00:05:59.793]  So take action, or be slaves!
[00:05:59.793 --> 00:05:59.833]  1-1-1
[00:06:09.995 --> 00:06:10.836]  It is the year 2020.
[00:06:10.836 --> 00:06:24.285]  We are 111 days out from this incredible election that is really a civil war between Americans who are pro-America, pro-freedom, and the globalist forces.
[00:06:24.285 --> 00:06:28.968]  Thank you so much for joining us on this July 14th, Tuesday, worldwide transmission.
[00:06:29.608 --> 00:06:30.908]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:30.908 --> 00:06:33.029]  I'll be here for the next four hours live.
[00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:34.550]  Paul Watson's joining us as well.
[00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:42.472]  Roger Stone, big exclusive, first long-form interview since he was granted clemency by the 45th President of the United States will be joining us.
[00:06:42.472 --> 00:06:45.153]  An in-depth interview in the second hour.
[00:06:45.153 --> 00:06:51.315]  We have Jim Hoff's brother who lived in Hong Kong and is an executive and looked at the numbers and writing a bunch of big articles.
[00:06:51.315 --> 00:06:54.636]  For Gateway Pundit, he's going to be joining us as well.
[00:06:54.636 --> 00:06:57.957]  So much to cover today.
[00:06:57.957 --> 00:06:58.817]  Okay, let's run over.
[00:06:59.912 --> 00:07:05.156]  Lockdown 2.0 is here, and the more you submit, the more lockdowns come.
[00:07:05.156 --> 00:07:07.258]  They were going to pull this whether Trump got elected or not.
[00:07:07.258 --> 00:07:10.300]  This is a global government power move.
[00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:22.911]  It's particularly nasty and political because of Trump, but they were always planning to introduce the world social credit score, tracking you in live time by law, and the worldwide police state using this.
[00:07:24.295 --> 00:07:29.259]  And of course they've always dovetailed breaking Western borders by saying any borders are racist.
[00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:37.106]  You must let the UN direct whoever they want who's been brainwashed into your country to be under UN globalist control.
[00:07:37.106 --> 00:07:39.168]  That is the pincer attack of world government.
[00:07:39.168 --> 00:07:42.531]  The global response to the virus they released.
[00:07:42.531 --> 00:07:50.118]  That is the right pincer attack, the left pincer attack, Black Lives Matter and Antifa worldwide, all funded by George Soros and the New World Order.
[00:07:51.906 --> 00:07:57.668]  And people see black leader statues being pulled down and anything old being pulled down.
[00:07:57.668 --> 00:07:59.509]  You think that's because their followers are idiots?
[00:07:59.509 --> 00:08:00.289]  Well, they are idiots.
[00:08:00.289 --> 00:08:03.711]  But the globalists love seeing mindless servitude.
[00:08:03.711 --> 00:08:06.832]  They love seeing Catholic churches burn all over the U.S.
[00:08:06.832 --> 00:08:07.572]  last night.
[00:08:07.572 --> 00:08:09.053]  Baptist churches burned.
[00:08:09.053 --> 00:08:10.874]  The left knows what they're doing.
[00:08:10.874 --> 00:08:14.555]  They're making their move now.
[00:08:14.555 --> 00:08:15.596]  Antifa can march.
[00:08:15.596 --> 00:08:17.016]  Black Lives Matter can march.
[00:08:17.016 --> 00:08:18.917]  The gay groups can march.
[00:08:18.917 --> 00:08:21.098]  But your church is going to burn.
[00:08:22.236 --> 00:08:27.258]  And Democrats from Michigan to California to New York are going to tell you, your church is not essential.
[00:08:27.258 --> 00:08:29.759]  But BLM is.
[00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:30.819]  Antifa is.
[00:08:30.819 --> 00:08:31.720]  That's all coming up.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.021]  George Soros publicly brags he's funding the groups.
[00:08:35.021 --> 00:08:37.282]  After denying it four years.
[00:08:37.282 --> 00:08:44.124]  He wants you to know, just like we went on Farid Zakaria five years ago and said, yes I funded with U.S.
[00:08:44.124 --> 00:08:48.106]  money given to me five billion overthrow of Ukraine government.
[00:08:48.106 --> 00:08:49.826]  I do it.
[00:08:49.826 --> 00:08:51.127]  I do it to you.
[00:08:53.127 --> 00:08:55.290]  You want me to play you a clip of him saying it?
[00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:56.692]  How about Joe Biden coming up next segment?
[00:08:56.692 --> 00:08:58.634]  Joe Biden came out and said that
[00:09:12.219 --> 00:09:14.180]  Women hold up half the sky.
[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:20.642]  That's a Mao Zedong statement about we're going to make your women not raise the children where they want to be or run the farm.
[00:09:20.642 --> 00:09:24.104]  We're going to make them work in a slave factory making American toys.
[00:09:24.104 --> 00:09:27.405]  That's feminism with suicide nets and forced abortions.
[00:09:27.405 --> 00:09:30.306]  It's so liberal!
[00:09:30.306 --> 00:09:32.687]  He came out and said, oh we need to be like China.
[00:09:32.687 --> 00:09:39.490]  Mao Zedong quoted Mao Zedong yesterday and we'll dovetail with him a few years ago saying we need China
[00:09:40.492 --> 00:09:45.174]  And the Communist Party in every facet of our lives.
[00:09:45.174 --> 00:09:46.954]  That's the model, the Communist Chinese.
[00:09:46.954 --> 00:09:50.596]  People say, how did you know this 20 years ago?
[00:09:50.596 --> 00:10:05.161]  I'd read the Council on Foreign Relations, Foreign Affairs, where all the big groups of the bankers and the media academics and the banking heads and the governmental heads get together and they tell you what they're going to do.
[00:10:08.669 --> 00:10:10.370]  And then they do it.
[00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.432]  They said it'll be the end of America, the Chinese century.
[00:10:13.432 --> 00:10:14.673]  They'll be allowed to have families.
[00:10:14.673 --> 00:10:15.794]  We won't.
[00:10:15.794 --> 00:10:19.916]  We're going to sterilize the children, making it trendy, saying they're going to be transsexual.
[00:10:19.916 --> 00:10:21.878]  And you read this stuff and it's like, how are they going to do that?
[00:10:21.878 --> 00:10:28.822]  We're going to weather control, spraying aluminum dioxide out with these radar dishes on the ground to create nuclei and control the weather.
[00:10:28.822 --> 00:10:29.763]  I mean, it's all public.
[00:10:30.143 --> 00:10:43.547]  You go there and it's like, how they control the weather, how they're going to chop your son's testicles off, how they're going to promote pedophilia, how they're going to end the family, how they're going to pass regulations so you can't live in the rural areas or the suburbs, and now it's all official.
[00:10:43.547 --> 00:10:55.550]  And I know, I tell you the stuff they're planning for years and show you the documents, replacement migration, 600 million people from the third world, the next 20 years replace Americans and have an outside group to control us, that's official UN website.
[00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.951]  I mean, this is what they're doing!
[00:10:59.528 --> 00:11:00.748]  I know it's insane.
[00:11:00.748 --> 00:11:01.909]  Hitler was crazy.
[00:11:01.909 --> 00:11:03.389]  Stalin was crazy.
[00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:05.110]  Mao was crazy.
[00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.370]  But you know what?
[00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:11.172]  We laid down to them so they almost took the planet over.
[00:11:11.172 --> 00:11:14.433]  And now Communist China is the New World Order's answer to America.
[00:11:14.433 --> 00:11:19.875]  They're not just going to defeat us economically and militarily, they're going to become us.
[00:11:19.875 --> 00:11:25.256]  We're going to be wedded to it, and it's going to be the man, and we're going to be the lady.
[00:11:25.256 --> 00:11:27.197]  There's not lubrication going to be used here.
[00:11:28.556 --> 00:11:30.439]  So, that's where we are.
[00:11:30.439 --> 00:11:33.984]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:11:33.984 --> 00:11:34.565]  The Economist.
[00:11:34.565 --> 00:11:35.326]  That's the Rothschilds.
[00:11:35.326 --> 00:11:36.307]  Literally own that.
[00:11:36.307 --> 00:11:39.231]  The Chinese century is well underway.
[00:11:43.188 --> 00:11:43.988]  How was 2018?
[00:11:43.988 --> 00:11:46.489]  Is that really going the way you thought it would?
[00:11:46.489 --> 00:11:49.230]  No, it's not going the way you thought it would.
[00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:53.212]  The best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[00:11:53.212 --> 00:12:02.675]  And up in their high perches above all their slaves, at the Bilderberg and the Rothschild and the Rockefeller and the CFR combines all run by the same people at the top.
[00:12:03.902 --> 00:12:05.623]  They believe they're invincible.
[00:12:05.623 --> 00:12:08.286]  Out there with Xi Jinping and his big military parades.
[00:12:08.286 --> 00:12:12.690]  But just like with Hitler and the Soviet Union, they're not going to get what they want.
[00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:13.891]  They're going to get a lot of it.
[00:12:13.891 --> 00:12:14.691]  And it's going to be rough.
[00:12:14.691 --> 00:12:24.820]  And it's going to get so horrible, everyone's going to be forced to get up off their asses, do something, and repudiate this, and admit that they were wrong.
[00:12:30.165 --> 00:12:32.809]  You will be forced to take action.
[00:12:32.809 --> 00:12:36.053]  You will be forced to fight for your very life.
[00:12:36.053 --> 00:12:39.759]  Because when it was easy to win, you didn't stand up for the unborn.
[00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:41.982]  When it was easy to win, you didn't stand up for the old people.
[00:12:41.982 --> 00:12:45.867]  When it was easy to win, you didn't stand up for your own right, your own territory, your own freedoms.
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.461]  And what are rights?
[00:12:48.461 --> 00:12:50.261]  Rights aren't just a term, a right you have.
[00:12:50.261 --> 00:12:53.783]  It's a right that people fought for, so there are rights of passage.
[00:12:53.783 --> 00:12:59.145]  There are rights of blood payment that you've been living off of, that I've been living off of.
[00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:01.966]  All of this largesse was money in the bank.
[00:13:01.966 --> 00:13:03.167]  It was blood in the bank.
[00:13:03.167 --> 00:13:04.567]  It was blood, sweat, and tears.
[00:13:04.567 --> 00:13:05.448]  It was paid for!
[00:13:08.763 --> 00:13:10.644]  But we took it for granted.
[00:13:10.644 --> 00:13:16.549]  And so now, like you pull a plug on a bathtub, it's circling the drain faster and faster.
[00:13:16.549 --> 00:13:18.831]  The water's going down quicker and quicker and quicker.
[00:13:18.831 --> 00:13:24.355]  And we're about to be high and dry, and all the denial, and all of it's gonna be over.
[00:13:24.355 --> 00:13:31.340]  And the nightmare will get more intense as they claim, oh, the answer's more socialism, more communism, more Satanism, more New World Order.
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.062]  And it'll finally get so terrible!
[00:13:34.633 --> 00:13:41.454]  That the enforcers and the jail guards of the New World Order will start rebelling, but then the globalists have always failed.
[00:13:41.454 --> 00:13:45.875]  The Jacobins have always failed because humans finally wake up.
[00:13:45.875 --> 00:13:53.717]  That's why the robots, the drones, the combat robots, the controls, the automated chips, everything not working.
[00:13:53.717 --> 00:13:56.477]  If they hit a switch, that's their deuce ex.
[00:13:56.477 --> 00:13:59.958]  That's their ace in the hole.
[00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.238]  That's their secret weapon.
[00:14:03.086 --> 00:14:04.726]  That's their master plan.
[00:14:04.726 --> 00:14:06.667]  So we move to rural areas.
[00:14:06.667 --> 00:14:07.687]  We become independent.
[00:14:07.687 --> 00:14:09.467]  We educate everyone about the New World Order.
[00:14:09.467 --> 00:14:13.628]  We dig in and we don't comply with any of the New World Order.
[00:14:13.628 --> 00:14:15.188]  And we boycott the New World Order.
[00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:16.829]  And we boycott their big companies.
[00:14:16.829 --> 00:14:20.270]  And we boycott their systems because they are the enemy.
[00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.150]  And we support the independent.
[00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:27.151]  Speaking of that, this has been in development for over a year, two years really.
[00:14:28.288 --> 00:14:34.435]  And we're really proud of it, but we're launching eight other products with it, with a whole new product line of really high quality stuff.
[00:14:34.435 --> 00:14:43.905]  It's being done under Dr. Jones Essentials, another company, a separate company from me, and we sell the product as we diversify operations for a lot of reasons.
[00:14:43.905 --> 00:14:46.028]  Deplatforming, you name it.
[00:14:46.028 --> 00:14:48.511]  And so, we have activated charcoal,
[00:14:50.305 --> 00:14:54.767]  Mouthwash and super high quality activated charcoal toothpaste with no additives.
[00:14:54.767 --> 00:14:55.927]  This stuff is amazing.
[00:14:55.927 --> 00:14:59.869]  This was not to compete with the old toothpaste, the whitening toothpaste, the super blue.
[00:14:59.869 --> 00:15:07.052]  You saw the Soros-financed attorney general that sent everybody to die in the nursing homes, the mass murderer, Letitia James.
[00:15:07.432 --> 00:15:07.692]  I don't
[00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:24.191]  Nothing to do with COVID-19.
[00:15:24.191 --> 00:15:26.692]  It's activated charcoal, a bunch of essential oils and things.
[00:15:26.692 --> 00:15:27.453]  It's really high quality.
[00:15:27.453 --> 00:15:29.114]  We can't sell it to you yet.
[00:15:29.114 --> 00:15:30.475]  It's been in for a couple weeks.
[00:15:30.475 --> 00:15:34.517]  There's one other test that's got to be done, because we follow all the most strict things.
[00:15:34.517 --> 00:15:35.658]  I thought the test were in.
[00:15:35.658 --> 00:15:39.600]  I thought it was done, the final test, a certificate of authenticity.
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.041]  It's not.
[00:15:40.041 --> 00:15:40.801]  It's in next week.
[00:15:40.801 --> 00:15:41.762]  The test is being done.
[00:15:41.762 --> 00:15:44.543]  So we don't have this on sale until next week.
[00:15:44.543 --> 00:15:47.385]  So the big sale, the big new thing I told you we had, it's not here.
[00:15:49.158 --> 00:15:57.881]  We went ahead and just launched what we had last year at this time, and that's Christmas Comes in July, where everything's free shipping, 50% off at mfullwordstore.com.
[00:15:57.881 --> 00:15:59.441]  I've been on air 26 years.
[00:15:59.441 --> 00:16:06.543]  Starting about 24 years ago, I began to get calls from major Hollywood directors, producers, actors.
[00:16:06.543 --> 00:16:10.285]  They wanted to meet with me, and they said, what is your formal education?
[00:16:10.285 --> 00:16:12.305]  And I said, well, really nothing but a few years of college.
[00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:18.187]  They said, well, how are you one of the best science fiction or cultural writers we've ever heard?
[00:16:18.928 --> 00:16:22.709]  The stuff you come up with is just unbelievable.
[00:16:22.709 --> 00:16:26.870]  We'd like you to be in movies, we'd like you to write with us, we'd like you to do voiceovers.
[00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:28.050]  You're just a renaissance man.
[00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:33.111]  If folks know I was in some movies and Harry Shearer makes statements like that and a lot of others, I'm not bragging.
[00:16:33.111 --> 00:16:38.132]  I kept explaining to them, I said, do you understand I didn't come up with any of this?
[00:16:38.132 --> 00:16:43.074]  I'm reading globalist MIT white papers and futurist documents.
[00:16:43.074 --> 00:16:44.834]  And they would just laugh at me and say, oh, no way.
[00:16:45.404 --> 00:16:47.185]  Then I would give them the documents.
[00:16:47.185 --> 00:16:48.786]  They would get very, very scared.
[00:16:48.786 --> 00:16:51.688]  You know, the next time I saw him in a few months and say, man, you're right.
[00:16:51.688 --> 00:16:52.849]  This is just toping.
[00:16:52.849 --> 00:16:55.130]  Folks, I didn't make any of this up.
[00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:55.570]  Okay.
[00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:56.211]  It's real.
[00:16:56.211 --> 00:16:57.291]  It's real.
[00:16:57.291 --> 00:17:01.514]  The reasons that the globalists launch this planetary lockdown.
[00:17:01.514 --> 00:17:05.676]  The number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes.
[00:17:05.676 --> 00:17:10.159]  We've gone over those purposes many times here on air.
[00:17:10.159 --> 00:17:15.142]  The cashless society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, forced inoculation,
[00:17:16.308 --> 00:17:32.454]  The most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential, as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had by design.
[00:17:32.454 --> 00:17:36.516]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[00:17:36.516 --> 00:17:39.657]  It's been pre-planned, organized, globally.
[00:17:39.657 --> 00:17:41.898]  And it's extremely predatory.
[00:17:41.898 --> 00:17:46.060]  And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations,
[00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:53.679]  The central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[00:17:53.679 --> 00:18:00.989]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[00:18:00.989 --> 00:18:03.652]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:18:16.496 --> 00:18:20.058]  A lot of people are going to ask me, what's up with the angel wings?
[00:18:20.058 --> 00:18:30.404]  Kind of a Roman archetypal standard symbol with a skull.
[00:18:30.404 --> 00:18:33.746]  And that's not plastic from the store.
[00:18:33.746 --> 00:18:37.188]  And that double-edged dagger right there, it's actually a tri-edged dagger.
[00:18:39.004 --> 00:18:45.067]  Maybe later I'll tell you what the symbolism for me means in it.
[00:18:45.067 --> 00:18:49.729]  It's definitely a message to everybody.
[00:18:49.729 --> 00:18:51.910]  You will not escape God's judgment.
[00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:53.570]  God is above death.
[00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:56.372]  God is above humans and war and life itself.
[00:18:56.372 --> 00:19:03.975]  That's right.
[00:19:03.975 --> 00:19:05.776]  You globalists don't want to be angels for sure.
[00:19:06.946 --> 00:19:10.107]  So don't try to drag us down with you.
[00:19:10.107 --> 00:19:12.368]  We don't want to be angels.
[00:19:12.368 --> 00:19:22.331]  We want to serve the same power that serves that God.
[00:19:22.331 --> 00:19:25.071]  Okay, let me tell you what we got coming up.
[00:19:25.071 --> 00:19:26.552]  Earth-shattering information.
[00:19:27.691 --> 00:19:37.280]  On the COVID-19 2.0, super draconian lockdown and what it's going to force you into, the forced inoculations, the contact tracers in your house, the taking of your family members.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.141]  The whole nightmare is not coming.
[00:19:39.141 --> 00:19:40.322]  We didn't predict it now.
[00:19:40.322 --> 00:19:41.563]  It's here.
[00:19:41.563 --> 00:19:42.664]  We did predict it.
[00:19:42.664 --> 00:19:44.806]  But it's here now.
[00:19:44.806 --> 00:19:45.927]  It's here.
[00:19:45.927 --> 00:19:53.374]  Like somebody tells you, you smoke three packs of cigarettes a day for 40 years, you're going to get lung cancer and you're finally coughing up blood and you go to the doctor and you've got a big old tumor.
[00:19:53.374 --> 00:19:54.475]  You don't have to wait anymore.
[00:19:55.646 --> 00:19:57.487]  Now, why am I getting to this really negative news?
[00:19:57.487 --> 00:20:00.910]  Because we got a chance to turn this around, though.
[00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:04.392]  But not much.
[00:20:04.392 --> 00:20:06.954]  Oh, they're going to win the next few big rounds.
[00:20:06.954 --> 00:20:08.155]  We're going to win in the end.
[00:20:08.155 --> 00:20:13.459]  I would like to bypass the really bad stuff, and getting out of this easy, we've already messed up.
[00:20:13.459 --> 00:20:14.239]  We're not going to get that.
[00:20:14.239 --> 00:20:18.762]  But we got a chance to, like, have a safe crash landing.
[00:20:18.762 --> 00:20:25.007]  Less of a deadly collapse, but if people don't really get the fear of God in them and get busy,
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.823]  I got to tell you, man, I guess we kind of deserve it, so whatever.
[00:20:29.823 --> 00:20:32.585]  But just, just, just, everybody better get ready then, okay?
[00:20:32.585 --> 00:20:36.467]  Because we're talking war on the streets, collapse, hell on earth, you're going to have to fight for your life.
[00:20:36.467 --> 00:20:43.973]  Now, we're going to get into George Soros and just him spreading his satanic black wings over the earth.
[00:20:43.973 --> 00:20:46.435]  That's coming up.
[00:20:46.435 --> 00:20:48.797]  And a lot of military news, economic news, you name it.
[00:20:49.824 --> 00:20:51.705]  But let's get to this first.
[00:20:51.705 --> 00:20:57.607]  It was David Rockefeller, when Mao Zedong died in 1976, wrote a big op-ed piece.
[00:20:57.607 --> 00:21:02.629]  You can just type in David Rockefeller, New York Times article, Mao Zedong.
[00:21:02.629 --> 00:21:07.870]  He wrote two of them, but you'll find the messages from a world traveler.
[00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:08.971]  I think it's the exact headline.
[00:21:10.086 --> 00:21:12.207]  And he says, I helped put Mao in.
[00:21:12.207 --> 00:21:12.927]  I love Mao.
[00:21:12.927 --> 00:21:14.108]  Mao's the answer.
[00:21:14.108 --> 00:21:15.308]  Communism's what we need.
[00:21:15.308 --> 00:21:19.750]  This is from the richest man in the world, arguably at the time, because he wants monopolies.
[00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:30.074]  His grandfather said, competition is a sin.
[00:21:30.074 --> 00:21:31.835]  They don't like competition.
[00:21:31.835 --> 00:21:34.136]  They like monopolies.
[00:21:34.136 --> 00:21:35.036]  So here's Joe Biden.
[00:21:36.289 --> 00:21:40.871]  Use this quote notably uttered by Mao Tse-Tung during a Big Money fundraiser report.
[00:21:40.871 --> 00:21:44.253]  And this is the guy that wrote down the transcript that was there during a Q&A session.
[00:21:44.253 --> 00:21:45.753]  There's no audio or video of this yet.
[00:21:45.753 --> 00:21:46.454]  Fox News Reports.
[00:21:47.691 --> 00:21:52.692]  Biden held a digital fundraiser featuring former President Obama advisor Valerie Jarrett.
[00:21:52.692 --> 00:22:01.975]  According to The Atlantic's Eric Isaac Dover, the former vice president cited an old Chinese proverb which discussed economic relief for women during a Q&A.
[00:22:01.975 --> 00:22:03.435]  Of course, it wasn't a Chinese proverb.
[00:22:03.435 --> 00:22:04.776]  It was a communist proverb.
[00:22:04.776 --> 00:22:07.196]  You've got to get real economic relief into women's hands.
[00:22:07.196 --> 00:22:12.458]  Biden reportedly said later, saying that women hold up half the sky, a famous Mao Zedong quote.
[00:22:12.458 --> 00:22:15.619]  That's who actually said that.
[00:22:15.619 --> 00:22:16.919]  So why is that so important?
[00:22:18.727 --> 00:22:27.009]  They forced hundreds of millions of Chinese women out of their houses with their children so you can only have one child, if you behave yourself, and put them in forced labor.
[00:22:27.009 --> 00:22:33.731]  So that's empowerment, though, for women, just like in the Middle East is sex slavery.
[00:22:33.731 --> 00:22:35.872]  Or wearing a burka over your head, which we all do now.
[00:22:35.872 --> 00:22:40.033]  We're all being put into the cult ritual.
[00:22:40.033 --> 00:22:46.435]  But remember this clip from a few years ago, the full video's up on InfoWars.com with the headline,
[00:22:48.317 --> 00:23:06.959]  Joe Biden says all American institutions, governmental, academic, ecclesiastical, we all need to adopt Chinese Communist oversight into what we do, because they own our debt, they own Hollywood, we've been positioned where they have all the jobs, not to help the Chinese people, but to exploit them globally.
[00:23:07.984 --> 00:23:14.427]  And that's what the globalists have done with their fake fiat money, and now their slave labor, and no environmental standards over there, but massive standards on us.
[00:23:14.427 --> 00:23:18.890]  They made it impossible for us to even operate, and then put us into check.
[00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:22.271]  But here comes Trump pulling us out of check, putting them into checkmate.
[00:23:22.271 --> 00:23:25.453]  So here's what Biden had to say.
[00:23:25.453 --> 00:23:37.059]  I'm also proud that more than 160 Fortune 500 companies are operating in Chengdu high-tech zone, including pioneer American businesses like Intel, Dell and Oracle.
[00:23:38.407 --> 00:23:44.372]  The U.S.-China relationship has also improved dramatically in the past 30 years.
[00:23:44.372 --> 00:23:54.621]  In order to cement this robust partnership, we have to go beyond close ties between Washington and Beijing, which we're working on every day.
[00:23:54.621 --> 00:23:57.664]  Go beyond it to include all levels of government.
[00:23:57.664 --> 00:24:02.428]  Go beyond it to include classrooms and laboratories, athletic fields and boardrooms.
[00:24:04.977 --> 00:24:11.850]  That's why we launched our 100,000 Strong initiative to boost the number of American students studying in China each year.
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:20.745]  And here's the article, flashback, Biden calls for communist Chinese influence at all levels of government classrooms and boardrooms.
[00:24:20.745 --> 00:24:21.845]  Can you imagine?
[00:24:21.845 --> 00:24:23.467]  We were over there saying that.
[00:24:23.467 --> 00:24:25.168]  But it's all part of throwing it in your face.
[00:24:25.168 --> 00:24:26.850]  See, they build it up behind the scenes.
[00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:27.950]  They demoralize the public.
[00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:32.634]  They train all these young people that have two or three college degrees that, well, you're going to be a communist.
[00:24:32.634 --> 00:24:34.075]  There's going to be a utopia.
[00:24:34.075 --> 00:24:36.717]  Bernie Sanders teaches that.
[00:24:36.717 --> 00:24:44.224]  Then all that happens is Bernie Sanders and his wife, with over 100 people under him, swindle all the money out of the college over five years and collapse a 100-year-old college.
[00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:49.160]  You get nothing but a death camp, a slave camp if you're lucky.
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:53.471]  You get to work 18 hours a day while they live in a palace and fly above you in helicopters.
[00:24:56.667 --> 00:24:57.748]  And that's how they get you.
[00:24:57.748 --> 00:25:00.950]  Like again, a Nigerian scam or other scams.
[00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:04.833]  People buy so many lottery tickets, they always keep buying thinking they're going to win.
[00:25:04.833 --> 00:25:08.256]  Or gamblers, just, I got to keep gambling, I'm going to get my money back.
[00:25:08.256 --> 00:25:10.178]  And it's just like, I bet on communism.
[00:25:10.178 --> 00:25:11.138]  I bet on socialism.
[00:25:11.138 --> 00:25:12.139]  I bet on the left.
[00:25:12.139 --> 00:25:23.048]  While Biden and the deep staters admit they shut the economy down to punish Trump and America and are trying to implode the economy under Cloward and Piven because they can't compete with a free market system.
[00:25:25.509 --> 00:25:35.774]  And the lazy schmucks that don't get that they've gotten more out of this system than they can get anywhere else for less work and be who they want to be like nowhere else.
[00:25:35.774 --> 00:25:41.036]  They literally think they're going to rule in some communist takeover.
[00:25:41.036 --> 00:25:44.898]  How many undercover videos of anti-fund Black Lives Matter and all this do we have?
[00:25:44.898 --> 00:25:45.578]  And now they're public.
[00:25:45.578 --> 00:25:47.259]  They're like, we will soon take over.
[00:25:47.259 --> 00:25:49.820]  You will work for us in slave camps.
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:53.302]  We will teach you.
[00:25:53.302 --> 00:25:53.622]  It's all
[00:25:54.778 --> 00:26:03.846]  Coming up, ladies and gentlemen, today, but there it is for you, just absolute communist Chinese garbage in your face.
[00:26:03.846 --> 00:26:05.648]  How did I know that's what happened?
[00:26:05.648 --> 00:26:11.913]  The CFR runs the country, set up by British intelligence, it's called a roundtable group.
[00:26:11.913 --> 00:26:16.057]  And they set up corporate roundtable groups in every country, South Africa,
[00:26:18.274 --> 00:26:19.517]  Germany.
[00:26:19.517 --> 00:26:20.238]  Mexico.
[00:26:20.238 --> 00:26:21.300]  That's who really runs it.
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:22.983]  That's how they bypass.
[00:26:22.983 --> 00:26:26.611]  Corporate, governmental, ecclesiastical, roundtable groups.
[00:26:27.401 --> 00:26:30.022]  They're the elite playing us off against each other.
[00:26:30.022 --> 00:26:31.283]  They're globalism.
[00:26:31.283 --> 00:26:32.983]  And they don't want you having money or being happy.
[00:26:32.983 --> 00:26:35.264]  They want you poor under their control.
[00:26:35.264 --> 00:26:36.645]  That's the real power they want.
[00:26:36.645 --> 00:26:44.968]  They did all this maneuvering and the AI takeover and all of this to position us to now come and sterilize us and fry us with 5G and kill us.
[00:26:44.968 --> 00:26:45.988]  Remember Hitler?
[00:26:45.988 --> 00:26:47.769]  He had a plan to take over.
[00:26:47.769 --> 00:26:48.990]  He had a EU plan.
[00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:53.551]  He had a plan to poison the food once he took over to slowly kill people so they wouldn't know what hit them.
[00:26:53.551 --> 00:26:54.292]  Oh yeah.
[00:26:54.292 --> 00:26:54.592]  Enjoy.

[00:27:23.619 --> 00:27:31.568]  Whether Trump wins or loses, the globalists have already created a worldwide depression, lockdowns on a planetary scale, and it's only intensifying.

[00:29:06.359 --> 00:29:11.061]  The good news is they had to do that to carry out this world government COVID takeover.
[00:29:11.741 --> 00:29:20.104]  This planetary corporate reset that COVID covers for, because the truth is powerful and will defeat them and will smash them.

[00:29:53.120 --> 00:30:01.245]  So take action or be slaves You're listening to the Alex Jones Show I
[00:30:18.362 --> 00:30:23.324]  If you're receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:30:23.324 --> 00:30:28.807]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:30:28.807 --> 00:30:35.030]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:39.572]  Never a dull moment when you're in reality.
[00:30:39.572 --> 00:30:46.516]  It's horrific, it's horrifying, it's exhilarating, it's empowering, it's engaging, it's real.
[00:30:48.106 --> 00:30:53.831]  And the more you learn how the universe works, the more you make the connections and discover.
[00:30:53.831 --> 00:31:03.238]  You stop being a reactive jellyfish that simply responds to stimuli.
[00:31:03.238 --> 00:31:08.202]  You begin taking control of your destiny.
[00:31:08.202 --> 00:31:11.925]  You begin to become empowered.
[00:31:17.993 --> 00:31:23.864]  All right, I'll get into the COVID-19 bombshell information and it's all the biggest yet.
[00:31:23.864 --> 00:31:26.849]  It's confirming our worst analysis, which isn't hard to do.
[00:31:26.849 --> 00:31:28.993]  We've got a lockstep, we've got event 201, we've got...
[00:31:29.764 --> 00:31:41.016]  I'm just admitting the whole thing that they'll use a real virus or a contrived virus to infect everyone and see everyone's suspect and then use a global system to track everywhere you go and establish world government.
[00:31:41.016 --> 00:31:45.841]  It actually says that in the 10-year-old lockstep Rockefeller plan.
[00:31:45.841 --> 00:31:50.225]  People are reading this going, what the hell?
[00:31:50.225 --> 00:31:52.428]  Why would they be so honest about it?
[00:31:53.564 --> 00:32:03.749]  Because they have to have training manuals to hand out as a drill, so that when they do it, they don't get busted for conspiracy.
[00:32:03.749 --> 00:32:06.770]  You understand?
[00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:11.312]  They go, oh, yeah, we all just happen to have this lockstep, this event 201.
[00:32:11.312 --> 00:32:14.154]  It happens to be exactly what's happening.
[00:32:14.154 --> 00:32:15.494]  But we were not planning it.
[00:32:15.494 --> 00:32:17.815]  We're not involved in it.
[00:32:17.815 --> 00:32:18.536]  Sure, in our drill.
[00:32:20.011 --> 00:32:21.331]  John Hopkins runs all the numbers.
[00:32:21.331 --> 00:32:22.132]  They do it in reality.
[00:32:22.132 --> 00:32:24.292]  And sure, in our drill, the UN gives all the directives.
[00:32:24.292 --> 00:32:24.952]  They do it in reality.
[00:32:24.952 --> 00:32:26.573]  And sure, it's a corona SARS virus.
[00:32:26.573 --> 00:32:27.553]  And sure, we run the lab.
[00:32:27.553 --> 00:32:30.274]  And sure, we transferred it in 2005 under major protest.
[00:32:30.274 --> 00:32:31.494]  And sure, we weaponize it.
[00:32:31.494 --> 00:32:32.434]  And sure, we have the patents.
[00:32:32.434 --> 00:32:33.655]  And sure, we're coming out with the vaccines.
[00:32:33.655 --> 00:32:34.575]  And sure, we own those.
[00:32:34.575 --> 00:32:35.495]  We'll make money off those.
[00:32:35.495 --> 00:32:36.395]  And the testing.
[00:32:36.395 --> 00:32:36.895]  And the tracking.
[00:32:36.895 --> 00:32:37.496]  And the tracing.
[00:32:37.496 --> 00:32:41.397]  And sure, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with the Clinton Global Initiative run the contact tracers.
[00:32:41.397 --> 00:32:42.157]  They're already making $5 billion.
[00:32:42.157 --> 00:32:43.757]  But it's okay!
[00:32:43.757 --> 00:32:46.118]  Because Tim Cook's gay.
[00:32:47.355 --> 00:32:49.737]  So, you know, that's where all of this goes.
[00:32:49.737 --> 00:32:51.459]  This is all a big plan.
[00:32:51.459 --> 00:32:52.600]  It's all systematic.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.823]  It's all a giant fraud.
[00:32:55.823 --> 00:32:58.866]  I was looking this morning at numbers out of Texas.
[00:32:58.866 --> 00:33:02.350]  Did you know flu deaths and pneumonia deaths and all these other deaths are way down?
[00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:07.935]  Because they've all been moved into the COVID column just like they've done around the country in months before.
[00:33:07.935 --> 00:33:11.619]  They're just still doing it and then admitting they're doing it!
[00:33:13.271 --> 00:33:20.015]  Because they're run by lawyers and they know you have to put it out in plain view and have people accept it.
[00:33:20.015 --> 00:33:22.496]  Now the lie has a little cover on it, but that's it.
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:29.601]  Bill Gates, more testing and contact tracing needed to safely reopen U.S.
[00:33:29.601 --> 00:33:30.521]  That's right.
[00:33:30.521 --> 00:33:33.442]  And he smiles with Fareed Zarkari and says it's never reopening.
[00:33:33.442 --> 00:33:34.982]  It looks like he's having an orgasm.
[00:33:34.982 --> 00:33:44.905]  When he talks about people dying in mass and bad reactions to vaccines, he starts giggling like an Academy Award winner would get for playing a psycho torturing a child to death.
[00:33:44.905 --> 00:33:50.226]  The man is a flaming maniac, eugenicist, depopulation demon!
[00:33:52.691 --> 00:34:06.899]  Imagine if I was on TV talking about millions of dead, 700,000 bad reactions, and America's never reopening, and I'm just like... I mean, he's just like, it's the funnest thing you ever saw!
[00:34:06.899 --> 00:34:09.121]  Sorry, I said that was next segment, didn't I?
[00:34:09.121 --> 00:34:10.261]  I started getting into it now.
[00:34:10.261 --> 00:34:11.502]  Let me get into this.
[00:34:11.502 --> 00:34:18.526]  So, you got the Communist Chinese set up by the big banks and traders in our government, and the Rothschilds in 1949.
[00:34:21.917 --> 00:34:38.129]  And now here we are, 60, 70 years later, and the thing's taking the world over with authoritarianism, the money, Hollywood, the universities, just everything is America bashing, America sucks, the NFL says don't have the Star Spangled Banner, don't have the, you know, they're gonna have some Black Lives Matter deal.
[00:34:38.129 --> 00:34:39.650]  You're like, what happened?
[00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:40.891]  Well, you got undermined!
[00:34:42.768 --> 00:34:46.070]  Now, no borders, no walls, no USA at all!
[00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:48.472]  You're like, oh, that's just a bunch of college idiots.
[00:34:48.472 --> 00:34:52.154]  No, those were the metastasizing polyps of cancer.
[00:34:52.154 --> 00:34:54.596]  Now they're floating around.
[00:34:54.596 --> 00:35:05.123]  And George Soros comes out, big article on InfoWars.com, announces it's doubling down on funding black-led justice organizations like Black Lives Matter in an article in the New York Times.
[00:35:05.123 --> 00:35:10.487]  And of course, also funding, at the very same time,
[00:35:11.707 --> 00:35:15.449]  It's just incredible how they're funding Antifa as well.
[00:35:15.449 --> 00:35:23.872]  But the first thing I want to go ahead and play for you is the hysteria, the craziness that's going on.
[00:35:23.872 --> 00:35:35.857]  This is a video of a deranged SJW yells to airline passengers, I will kill everybody on this plane unless you accept Jesus was a black man, then we'll play
[00:35:36.977 --> 00:35:45.608]  The clip here of Marxist BLM protester leader calls for black militia revolution.
[00:35:45.608 --> 00:35:53.078]  Police man killed by ex-cop biker because he was white ranted about Trump and white people.
[00:35:53.078 --> 00:35:54.920]  And you look at the look on these guys faces.
[00:35:55.981 --> 00:36:08.271]  When they come up to just a random road and shoot a white dude in the head or shoot a family or whatever, and it's usually white dudes that do it, they have looks of ecstasy and satisfaction of their stoicness.
[00:36:08.271 --> 00:36:19.061]  Like they just climbed a mountain and took out a Nazi machine gun nest because the media is telling them they're heroes, telling them they're good, and they take that as an authority, not a Chi-Com funded attack.
[00:36:19.061 --> 00:36:21.643]  So here's two of those clips back to back.
[00:36:31.914 --> 00:36:36.297]  I will kill everybody!
[00:36:36.297 --> 00:36:38.558]  Everybody!
[00:36:38.558 --> 00:36:41.500]  I will kill everybody!
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.022]  Except him!
[00:36:44.022 --> 00:36:45.442]  Die in the name of Jesus!
[00:36:45.442 --> 00:36:47.764]  In the name of Jesus!
[00:36:47.764 --> 00:36:50.245]  Die in the name of Jesus!
[00:36:50.245 --> 00:36:53.407]  In the name of Jesus!
[00:36:53.407 --> 00:36:54.148]  You understand?
[00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:08.838]  Now let's hear from the black militia leader.
[00:37:08.838 --> 00:37:12.184]  Racism thrives on capitalism.
[00:37:12.184 --> 00:37:14.168]  The back of racism is capitalism.
[00:37:16.024 --> 00:37:19.887]  And they say about education, we need a black militia.
[00:37:19.887 --> 00:37:24.370]  When I say that, I'm not saying it because I want people to fear and think we're coming violent.
[00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:27.612]  What we're saying is, you push, we push.
[00:37:27.612 --> 00:37:29.513]  You fight, we fight.
[00:37:29.513 --> 00:37:31.995]  Peace is not peace until you recognize our life.
[00:37:31.995 --> 00:37:33.796]  And we're not going to lay down no more.
[00:37:33.796 --> 00:37:35.417]  I'm not going down on a knee.
[00:37:35.417 --> 00:37:40.841]  I'm always going to be 10 toes standing, just like my ancestors, 10 toes standing.
[00:37:40.841 --> 00:37:42.902]  No justice, no peace!
[00:37:42.902 --> 00:37:44.843]  No justice, no peace!
[00:37:44.843 --> 00:37:45.784]  Take it to the streets!
[00:37:50.194 --> 00:37:58.617]  So she's going to fight to get into your country, and then she's going to bitch and complain about it and say she must overthrow you.
[00:37:58.617 --> 00:37:59.897]  And then there'll be 12 to 1 black on white crime.
[00:37:59.897 --> 00:38:01.477]  But statistics don't matter.
[00:38:01.477 --> 00:38:03.978]  And it was her ancestors who sold black people to white people.
[00:38:14.241 --> 00:38:15.102]  But none of that matters.
[00:38:15.102 --> 00:38:17.184]  It's all, she's good, she's black.
[00:38:17.184 --> 00:38:18.626]  You're bad, you're white.
[00:38:18.626 --> 00:38:25.993]  And then you stand around in camo and feel powerful about communism when Karl Marx said that black people weren't humans and that he hated Jews.
[00:38:25.993 --> 00:38:26.874]  But that's okay!
[00:38:27.844 --> 00:38:29.746]  Because Tim Cook's gay.
[00:38:29.746 --> 00:38:31.689]  Tim Cook runs giant death camps.
[00:38:31.689 --> 00:38:34.232]  Millions of people making Apple widgets on record.
[00:38:34.232 --> 00:38:35.533]  It's okay.
[00:38:35.533 --> 00:38:38.597]  He wears little black sweaters and goes, eh, eh, eh.
[00:38:38.597 --> 00:38:40.058]  And see, that's what this is all about.
[00:38:40.058 --> 00:38:47.888]  Ignoramus' video, UK black rioters tear down statue of African icon Hailey Sesele.
[00:38:49.195 --> 00:38:51.096]  And it goes on from there.
[00:38:51.096 --> 00:38:54.818]  That's what you're dealing with, is invincible arrogance and evil and hatred.
[00:38:54.818 --> 00:38:56.479]  I haven't gotten to one-tenth of these.
[00:38:56.479 --> 00:39:03.364]  You know, the BLM supporters celebrate death of mother, shot dead for saying all lives matter.
[00:39:03.364 --> 00:39:08.547]  And BLM is now publicly celebrating her murder.
[00:39:08.547 --> 00:39:15.251]  And again, police man killed ex-cop biker because he was white, ranted about Trump and white people after arrest.
[00:39:16.539 --> 00:39:20.382]  I know a retired SWAT team officer who teaches CrossFit classes.
[00:39:20.382 --> 00:39:21.923]  They found out he was a retired officer.
[00:39:21.923 --> 00:39:23.904]  They said, we don't want your kind here.
[00:39:23.904 --> 00:39:25.765]  You're fired because you were an officer.
[00:39:25.765 --> 00:39:27.006]  That's someone I know.
[00:39:27.006 --> 00:39:28.527]  That's CrossFit in Austin.
[00:39:28.527 --> 00:39:30.969]  That's who these cultists are.
[00:39:30.969 --> 00:39:37.894]  And there's nothing lost on them, ironically, that they're such hypocrites when they call the cops when there's a problem.
[00:39:39.428 --> 00:39:40.569]  You understand?
[00:39:40.569 --> 00:39:46.653]  Or they call up when their power's off and, you know, bitch for the telephone company or power company to come fix the lines.
[00:39:46.653 --> 00:39:48.694]  They want the power.
[00:39:48.694 --> 00:39:49.815]  It's a leftist takeover.
[00:39:49.815 --> 00:39:51.556]  They've been to college to learn how to do this.
[00:39:51.556 --> 00:39:52.176]  That's it.
[00:39:52.176 --> 00:39:52.777]  That's all it is.
[00:39:54.995 --> 00:40:05.777]  Americans have had freedom for so long, and most Americans were born into such docile times compared to the rest of history, that we really have a blind spot for tyranny.
[00:40:05.777 --> 00:40:15.379]  We don't appreciate the American way, truth, justice, due process, the right to self-defense, private property, because we've had it so long, and we just think that's how the rest of the world is.
[00:40:15.379 --> 00:40:18.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old,
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:29.543]  To try to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak as well as the strong is something the West invented and that's what made our modern world.
[00:40:29.543 --> 00:40:43.748]  That's now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth and we need to be culled and dumbed down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate, manipulate and command if we're even lucky enough to stay alive.
[00:40:44.208 --> 00:40:45.892]  And that's what COVID-19 is.
[00:40:45.892 --> 00:40:52.586]  A global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family, against prosperity, and against your future.
[00:40:52.586 --> 00:40:54.349]  If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[00:40:54.833 --> 00:40:57.814]  I know what we'll do to make them conform to our cult.
[00:40:57.814 --> 00:41:06.377]  We'll all tell them to wear masks or they're gonna die, and then we'll release the pressure for a while, then bring it back and squeeze it harder, and release it again, and we'll be the virtue signalers.
[00:41:06.377 --> 00:41:11.839]  We'll be the angels, even though our lord and master, Bill Gates, helped fund the whole COVID-19, oh.
[00:41:11.839 --> 00:41:12.079]  No!
[00:41:12.079 --> 00:41:15.560]  Don't sadookie me!
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:26.384]  That's right, that's the code word for Bill Gates' operation he carries out with his good little buddy Dr. Fauci in the surgeon cult.
[00:41:26.384 --> 00:41:32.026]  As you know, for girls there's five different types of villains they secretly desire in the romance novels.
[00:41:32.026 --> 00:41:34.847]  One of them's the vampire, the werewolf,
[00:41:35.387 --> 00:41:38.369]  Psychopaths are so hot.
[00:41:38.369 --> 00:41:38.629]  Oh, yeah.
[00:42:05.362 --> 00:42:06.843]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[00:42:06.843 --> 00:42:13.806]  Where did it come from?

[00:42:57.102 --> 00:42:58.864]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[00:42:58.864 --> 00:42:59.345]  You're on the air.
[00:42:59.345 --> 00:42:59.885]  Thanks for holding.
[00:42:59.885 --> 00:43:00.165]  Hello.
[00:43:00.165 --> 00:43:00.946]  Can you hear me?
[00:43:00.946 --> 00:43:01.587]  I sure can, sir.
[00:43:01.587 --> 00:43:02.027]  Thank you.
[00:43:02.027 --> 00:43:02.668]  Hey, Alex.
[00:43:02.668 --> 00:43:08.895]  Before I start, man, I just... I've been wanting to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right now with you, man.
[00:43:08.895 --> 00:43:10.236]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[00:43:10.236 --> 00:43:12.259]  I'm calling from New Brink, Connecticut, and...
[00:43:12.899 --> 00:43:14.361]  I just want to plug in.
[00:43:14.361 --> 00:43:18.445]  I'm a truck driver and two before us have changed the way I drive.
[00:43:18.445 --> 00:43:20.687]  Me and my brothers that drive.
[00:43:20.687 --> 00:43:21.708]  There's a couple of us.
[00:43:21.708 --> 00:43:25.412]  We're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[00:43:25.412 --> 00:43:33.660]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank you for that.
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:39.823]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder there is.
[00:43:39.823 --> 00:43:42.104]  So this was designed by one of the top guys in the country.
[00:43:42.104 --> 00:43:44.565]  He didn't want his name on it because, obviously, the political issues.
[00:43:44.565 --> 00:43:47.246]  But we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[00:43:47.246 --> 00:43:51.287]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there.
[00:43:51.287 --> 00:43:53.068]  And you're saying that it's made your life better.
[00:43:53.068 --> 00:43:53.808]  So that means a lot to me.
[00:43:53.808 --> 00:43:55.149]  Thank you to all your truck drivers.
[00:43:55.149 --> 00:43:59.471]  We love you.
[00:43:59.471 --> 00:44:02.092]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:12.066 --> 00:44:12.729]  Welcome back!
[00:44:16.644 --> 00:44:22.229]  Famed Marxist activist says Biden candidate most prone to being pressured.
[00:44:22.229 --> 00:44:26.033]  That's famed Marxist, you know, the folks that mass murder, Angela Davis.
[00:44:26.033 --> 00:44:30.217]  And of course, now a convicted weatherman lady has been caught running Black Lives Matter.
[00:44:30.217 --> 00:44:32.579]  And if you talk about it, you get banned off the Internet.
[00:44:32.579 --> 00:44:34.581]  A very famous member, but that's another lady.
[00:44:34.581 --> 00:44:37.404]  This is Angela Davis, another one of these nasty people.
[00:44:37.404 --> 00:44:38.625]  And here she is talking about Biden.
[00:44:41.172 --> 00:44:49.515]  I don't see this election as being about choosing a candidate who will be able to lead us in the right direction.
[00:44:49.515 --> 00:45:02.941]  It will be about choosing a candidate who can be most effectively pressured into allowing more space for the evolving anti-racist movement.
[00:45:02.941 --> 00:45:05.241]  Biden is very problematic in many ways.
[00:45:05.241 --> 00:45:09.223]  He is not only in terms of his past and the role that he played and
[00:45:09.915 --> 00:45:18.901]  of pushing toward mass incarceration, but he has indicated that he is opposed to disbanding the police.
[00:45:18.901 --> 00:45:20.642]  And this is definitely what we need.
[00:45:20.642 --> 00:45:27.266]  We need to re-conceptualize the very notion of public safety.
[00:45:27.266 --> 00:45:38.873]  But, I say but, Biden is far more likely to take mass demands seriously, far more likely
[00:45:39.528 --> 00:45:43.070]  They're the current occupant of the White House.
[00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:47.473]  So let's think about what the left wants financed by big mega banks, the Chai comms, and the establishment.
[00:45:48.339 --> 00:45:52.300]  You know, the woke corporate stuff, with all their private security and the rest of it.
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:54.921]  We don't get police, and we also have to have our guns taken.
[00:45:54.921 --> 00:46:04.505]  So, take all the guns, then no police, and then have Marxists running around shooting us in the head, killing us, coming up to checkpoints and saying, are you for Black Lives Matter?
[00:46:04.505 --> 00:46:06.205]  Ah, you're white!
[00:46:06.205 --> 00:46:07.986]  I mean, that's what's going on.
[00:46:07.986 --> 00:46:14.188]  The most evil, crazy mobs going into churches.
[00:46:14.188 --> 00:46:15.949]  Now, guess who's coming up here in just a moment?
[00:46:17.119 --> 00:46:17.779]  Roger Stone.
[00:46:17.779 --> 00:46:20.161]  I thought we even have him there on screen.
[00:46:20.161 --> 00:46:20.701]  There he is.
[00:46:20.701 --> 00:46:24.384]  We're going to be going to Roger here in just a moment.
[00:46:24.384 --> 00:46:25.485]  In the second hour.
[00:46:25.485 --> 00:46:29.828]  Look very much forward to him giving us the first big exclusive in-depth interview.
[00:46:29.828 --> 00:46:31.108]  Went on handy last night.
[00:46:31.108 --> 00:46:31.689]  That's awesome.
[00:46:31.689 --> 00:46:33.510]  But this time he won't just have 10 minutes.
[00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:46.539]  He will have the whole next hour to really get into the election, his clemency, being attacked by Mueller, being attacked by Stephanopoulos that says that Trump should be, this is unprecedented, that Trump should be
[00:46:47.619 --> 00:46:56.061]  Removed from office via impeachment for this when Stephanopoulos oversaw the pardoning of, you know, pedophiles and murderers and criminals.
[00:46:56.061 --> 00:46:57.762]  It's just simply astounding.
[00:46:57.762 --> 00:47:00.562]  That is all coming up with Roger Stone.
[00:47:00.562 --> 00:47:02.383]  But first, let's finish up this segment.
[00:47:02.383 --> 00:47:06.584]  Let's now go back and just show you some of the articles here.
[00:47:06.584 --> 00:47:10.605]  The police have announced that Portland is now in a state of a riot.
[00:47:11.448 --> 00:47:14.070]  And there are people being shot and killed and stabbed every night.
[00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:19.435]  And we have all this footage of Antifa stopping random cars and pulling doors open.
[00:47:19.435 --> 00:47:24.479]  When they pull a door open and it's a black guy, the guy gets out and beats up the white thug.
[00:47:24.479 --> 00:47:31.324]  In fact, you even hear the Antifa go, ooh, because it's a black guy.
[00:47:31.324 --> 00:47:33.907]  That's above the law.
[00:47:33.907 --> 00:47:37.049]  And so the black guy gets out and slams him into the ground.
[00:47:37.049 --> 00:47:40.192]  But then they start just beating up old white people.
[00:47:41.172 --> 00:47:44.994]  Because that's the number one mission is, oh, you're old, you're white.
[00:47:44.994 --> 00:47:51.077]  It's a group of mainly women dressed in black beating up.
[00:47:51.077 --> 00:47:52.818]  So stuff's getting really, really crazy.
[00:47:52.818 --> 00:47:54.639]  They're hitting people in the head with hammers, you name it.
[00:47:54.639 --> 00:47:58.280]  And they're just randomly beating people up.
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:02.743]  But if you have an American flag, they really go after you.
[00:48:02.743 --> 00:48:05.784]  Look at this old man.
[00:48:05.784 --> 00:48:07.325]  He's just out there, so they steal his bike.
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:13.923]  And he tries to go get his bike back, so they leave him in the hat.
[00:48:13.923 --> 00:48:16.745]  You think we have respect for your fucking son?
[00:48:16.745 --> 00:48:19.007]  You think we have respect for your fucking son?
[00:48:19.007 --> 00:48:25.972]  So if you're a radio listener, they are literally breaking into buildings, attacking people.
[00:48:36.272 --> 00:48:38.474]  Attacking the police department.
[00:48:38.474 --> 00:48:40.135]  Trying to break into the police department.
[00:48:40.135 --> 00:48:44.258]  I mean, it is just absolute insane asylum.
[00:48:44.258 --> 00:48:45.279]  They don't want to get rid of the police.
[00:48:45.279 --> 00:48:47.701]  They want to be the police.
[00:48:47.701 --> 00:48:48.842]  I mean, we got a few bad police.
[00:48:48.842 --> 00:48:50.463]  We got some problems.
[00:48:50.463 --> 00:48:52.045]  But that's a reflection of us.
[00:48:52.045 --> 00:48:57.189]  Can you imagine these people in charge of anything?
[00:48:57.189 --> 00:48:59.511]  And again, what they try to do is jump on the front of your car.
[00:49:00.796 --> 00:49:02.157]  And then they call the police on you.
[00:49:02.157 --> 00:49:10.764]  Like when they blocked, last week, the Seattle Highway at night, a guy sees an emergency vehicle, drives around it, and runs over a couple of women.
[00:49:10.764 --> 00:49:11.965]  One of them dies.
[00:49:11.965 --> 00:49:13.767]  And the news announced white supremacist strikes.
[00:49:13.767 --> 00:49:16.289]  It was a black Somali.
[00:49:16.289 --> 00:49:17.289]  Wasn't trying to kill anybody.
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:26.727]  He was going around cars, and I'll be honest with you, I've driven on the shoulder, I've driven through the grass, you know, to get around things as well.
[00:49:26.727 --> 00:49:34.414]  But you don't want to do it now because you don't know if there's Antifa or Black Lives Matter out in the road blocking it like idiots!
[00:49:34.414 --> 00:49:42.440]  And if there is a Darwin Award in this universe, it is playing on the highway at night.
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:44.842]  That's really, really, really asking for it.
[00:49:45.871 --> 00:49:53.417]  I'm out of time on Soros and the whole revolution they're trying to finance and how they now admit to it all after they were just denying it all.
[00:49:53.417 --> 00:50:01.062]  I have a giant stack of developing lockdown California, lockdown Texas is coming, Austin today or tomorrow.
[00:50:01.062 --> 00:50:07.487]  We have it from inside the police department and the mayor's office that the mayor is currently planning to lock everything down today or tomorrow.
[00:50:09.346 --> 00:50:11.187]  That may not happen, but that's the current thing.
[00:50:11.187 --> 00:50:13.469]  The governor has sold us out, and it's going along with this.
[00:50:13.469 --> 00:50:17.592]  It's to create a new depression, and to drive Trump from office.
[00:50:17.592 --> 00:50:18.652]  And it's absolutely insane.
[00:50:18.652 --> 00:50:21.274]  They're using inflated numbers, as you know.
[00:50:21.274 --> 00:50:24.176]  Florida had 333, that's Don Salazar's top article, 333 testing labs found 100% positive.
[00:50:31.394 --> 00:50:34.696]  Obviously, folks, they've been told just to say everybody that comes in is positive.
[00:50:34.696 --> 00:50:37.258]  I told you about my wife's personal trainer, friend of mine.
[00:50:37.258 --> 00:50:41.481]  She trains two old ladies, older women, and they had a cough and stuff a few months ago.
[00:50:41.481 --> 00:50:44.263]  So they said, let's go in and get tested.
[00:50:44.263 --> 00:50:44.983]  The line was too long.
[00:50:44.983 --> 00:50:46.224]  They said, just fill out your name and number.
[00:50:46.224 --> 00:50:46.904]  We'll call you back later.
[00:50:46.904 --> 00:50:47.545]  They got emails.
[00:50:47.545 --> 00:50:49.926]  You have COVID-19.
[00:50:49.926 --> 00:50:53.268]  And if you read the guidelines that Texas follows, only eight states follow it.
[00:50:53.268 --> 00:50:55.370]  Seven Democrat states in Texas, that's what it says.
[00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:59.793]  That's all coming up in the third hour today.
[00:51:01.155 --> 00:51:04.918]  And we also again have Jim Hoff's brother who writes for Gateway Pundit.
[00:51:04.918 --> 00:51:07.920]  John Hoff is going to be joining us coming up to break all of that down.
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:12.523]  We'll also open the phones up and Paul Joseph Watson will be with us as well.
[00:51:12.523 --> 00:51:16.226]  But separately, everybody's been pushing me to promote these.
[00:51:16.226 --> 00:51:18.128]  We've tested out a bunch of different companies.
[00:51:18.128 --> 00:51:20.990]  Some of them cost way more and don't work as well.
[00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:27.855]  These have a 99% rate with myself and the rest of the crew testing them to block cell phones.
[00:51:27.855 --> 00:51:28.895]  Now see what happens is,
[00:51:30.903 --> 00:51:40.025]  Even when your cell phone's off, pings from the GPS from the cell towers go to it every few seconds and track everywhere you go and then sell the data.
[00:51:40.025 --> 00:51:43.946]  Now Bill Clinton's foundation with Bill Gates runs this.
[00:51:43.946 --> 00:51:53.469]  Chelsea's on the board and they have the data now on iPhones, Androids to track you and then they use this data to absolutely enslave you, set you up, sell your data, abuse you.
[00:51:53.469 --> 00:51:57.250]  It's like locking your house at night, closing your windows at night so mosquitoes don't get in.
[00:51:58.496 --> 00:52:00.137]  You have to take control of your life.
[00:52:00.137 --> 00:52:09.821]  And now that these pockets have gotten thin enough with new materials they have, the old ones didn't work that well, they were like 80% more bulky, I now use these all the time.
[00:52:09.821 --> 00:52:15.543]  And it's a way to use your cell phone less, to be aware of the fact you're being tracked, and to take control of your life.
[00:52:15.543 --> 00:52:16.564]  And so this is the only way.
[00:52:16.564 --> 00:52:21.646]  Even when you turn the apps off, even when you turn the tracking off, it doesn't work.
[00:52:21.646 --> 00:52:22.426]  They're still tracking you.
[00:52:22.426 --> 00:52:25.268]  That's admitted in the Wall Street Journal, and Fox News admitted that last week.
[00:52:26.431 --> 00:52:28.233]  These are the Privacy Pockets.
[00:52:28.233 --> 00:52:30.234]  They come in red.
[00:52:30.234 --> 00:52:31.335]  They come in blue.
[00:52:31.335 --> 00:52:32.996]  They come in green and black.
[00:52:32.996 --> 00:52:38.941]  They have a great pouch system that takes almost any size of phone from small to large.
[00:52:38.941 --> 00:52:43.885]  They have some bigger units for tablets and iPads and things like that at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:52:43.885 --> 00:52:47.188]  And you absolutely need these.
[00:52:47.188 --> 00:52:48.529]  They're $19.95.
[00:52:48.529 --> 00:52:53.593]  Most people sell pockets of this quality for $29.95 because they need to mark it up 200%.
[00:52:53.593 --> 00:52:54.014]  We don't do that.
[00:52:55.708 --> 00:52:57.549]  They're marked up 100%.
[00:52:57.549 --> 00:52:59.250]  So we make 10 bucks on these.
[00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:01.412]  You really need to get these and give them as gifts.
[00:53:01.412 --> 00:53:07.896]  It's also an educational thing for your wife, your husband, your neighbor, your boss, your employees, about, hey, you have nothing to hide, but you still lock your door at night, right?
[00:53:07.896 --> 00:53:12.099]  You have nothing to hide, but you have a passcode on your phone, because there are people who want to break into it.
[00:53:12.099 --> 00:53:15.080]  Well, they're doing it remotely, including hackers and criminals.
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:16.581]  And why is that important?
[00:53:16.581 --> 00:53:20.604]  New York Times, Washington Post, all reports on Infowars.com as well.
[00:53:20.604 --> 00:53:23.206]  New court filing, Ghislaine Maxwell,
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:32.243]  Fled across house during raid.
[00:53:32.243 --> 00:53:34.805]  FBI found tinfoil wrapped cell phone.
[00:53:34.805 --> 00:53:38.307]  So she was running when they busted in to get to the tinfoil wrapped cell phone.
[00:53:38.307 --> 00:53:44.811]  I guess the super spy wasn't smart enough to have one of these.
[00:53:44.811 --> 00:53:55.417]  Because if you are trying to not be tracked and traced by the insurance companies, the foreign banks, the globalists, Antifa, if you've got any apps on your phone, they're selling all the companies, all the data to the Democrats.
[00:53:56.874 --> 00:53:59.336]  You want to take control of your life.
[00:53:59.336 --> 00:54:02.338]  Well, she didn't have a privacy pocket.
[00:54:02.338 --> 00:54:09.364]  She had tinfoil, which does work if you put, I'm told, six or seven layers of it on there.
[00:54:09.364 --> 00:54:15.749]  Well, why do you want to have a tinfoil when you can have it actually with the copper Faraday cage that completely blocks it?
[00:54:15.749 --> 00:54:21.394]  When I say 99%, we tested it for weeks, and every once in a while, if you get right underneath the cell tower,
[00:54:22.597 --> 00:54:25.279]  It's strong enough to still get in and track where you are.
[00:54:25.279 --> 00:54:27.681]  So again, this is something that is essential.
[00:54:27.681 --> 00:54:36.186]  It's at infowarestorer.com, your privacy pocket, to tell Bill Clinton and the contact tracers and all of them, burn in hell, go to hell.
[00:54:36.186 --> 00:54:41.830]  You may be rapists, you may be child molesters, but you're not going to rape our privacy.
[00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:43.251]  What if Ghislaine Maxwell would have had this?
[00:54:43.251 --> 00:54:43.952]  You wouldn't have got caught.
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:55:01.753]  Whether you believe in evolution in the modern theory or not, the globalist controllers do, and they constantly write about and talk about how they want to create a global crisis or a group of crises that force humans to, quote, evolve in a new, better way.
[00:55:01.753 --> 00:55:04.896]  Now, when you study how they actually want you to evolve, if you believe in that,
[00:55:05.416 --> 00:55:09.618]  It is to stop having children emerge with silicon bodies and a post-human future.
[00:55:09.618 --> 00:55:11.058]  Talk about psychotic.
[00:55:11.058 --> 00:55:12.339]  Talk about creepy.
[00:55:12.339 --> 00:55:13.279]  Talk about crazy.
[00:55:13.279 --> 00:55:30.286]  But they need an event like COVID-19 to teach a mammal to wear some covering over its nose, over its breathing tubes, to set the precedent for the forced inoculations, for the GMO, for the 5G, and for all the things that they admit will end our humanity as we know it.
[00:55:30.606 --> 00:55:32.047]  That's why this is so evil.
[00:55:32.047 --> 00:55:40.850]  Their whole agenda for a cashless society, global government, UN control, getting us all into debt, getting rid of local government.
[00:55:40.850 --> 00:55:42.270]  Think about all the facets of it.
[00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:44.191]  The censorship, the surveillance.
[00:55:46.465 --> 00:55:53.610]  So I was taking care of an errand this morning, and I wasn't even close to downtown, but I was parked on a little side street going to this business.
[00:55:53.610 --> 00:56:02.556]  When I came back out, I saw what looked like two Asian folks, probably Chinese, walking down the sidewalk about 50 yards up ahead of me.
[00:56:02.556 --> 00:56:07.319]  And here I am parked a truck with the windows up, and the woman stops and points at me.
[00:56:07.319 --> 00:56:10.582]  So they stop, and they wait while I'm inside my truck.
[00:56:10.582 --> 00:56:11.562]  Truck started.
[00:56:11.562 --> 00:56:12.843]  And they sit there and stretch.
[00:56:12.843 --> 00:56:13.644]  She keeps pointing.
[00:56:14.284 --> 00:56:16.292]  And they put their hands out like they're waiting for me.
[00:56:17.625 --> 00:56:22.049]  To go, because I'm not wearing a mask inside my car.
[00:56:22.049 --> 00:56:26.012]  And so then I just sat there, so they acted angry and walked past me.
[00:56:26.012 --> 00:56:31.376]  I almost shot a video of it on my phone, but everybody sees this stuff happening everywhere.
[00:56:31.376 --> 00:56:32.337]  This is mental illness.
[00:56:32.337 --> 00:56:35.920]  People are pulling guns on folks that aren't wearing masks.
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:37.341]  This is all cult programming.
[00:56:37.341 --> 00:56:38.922]  This is all about submitting.
[00:56:38.922 --> 00:56:41.765]  We cannot submit to this UN brainwashing.
[00:56:41.765 --> 00:56:43.146]  It's all a giant fraud.
[00:56:43.146 --> 00:56:45.448]  We must expose the fraud or become slaves to it.
[00:56:48.968 --> 00:57:02.099]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:02.099 --> 00:57:12.988]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:57:17.202 --> 00:57:22.365]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:22.365 --> 00:57:25.427]  Well, Donald Trump is the most famous person in the world right now.
[00:57:25.427 --> 00:57:27.668]  I don't think anybody doubts that.
[00:57:27.668 --> 00:57:33.211]  And I had the title, when they were really demonizing me a few years ago, of the most infamous person.
[00:57:33.211 --> 00:57:35.252]  Not a title that you want.
[00:57:35.252 --> 00:57:39.935]  Roger Stone now has the title of the most infamous person in America.
[00:57:41.027 --> 00:57:42.208]  At least in leftist minds.
[00:57:42.208 --> 00:57:47.732]  When we go out in public, even a year ago, people tried to attack him and I, screaming at us that we're Russian traitors.
[00:57:47.732 --> 00:57:51.235]  So I was inviting him to Austin, and he said, well, I probably can't leave my house.
[00:57:51.235 --> 00:57:52.616]  People are trying to kill me.
[00:57:52.616 --> 00:57:56.600]  And literally, folks, it was bad a year ago, because I had one of the same security guys.
[00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:57.781]  He did some work for Roger.
[00:57:57.781 --> 00:57:59.022]  He said they'd go to the grocery store.
[00:57:59.662 --> 00:58:09.052]  He'd shake ten hands, and then somebody trying to throw, you know, a can of peas at him, screaming, Russian, Russian, F you, you know, people spitting on his steaks.
[00:58:09.052 --> 00:58:10.553]  I mean, just hellish behavior.
[00:58:10.553 --> 00:58:12.255]  So, and it's not he's a victim.
[00:58:12.255 --> 00:58:14.978]  It's talking about the derangement of these people.
[00:58:14.978 --> 00:58:17.720]  And now, Robert Mueller's come out from under his rock.
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:20.203]  There's all these articles, false quoting him from my show.
[00:58:20.203 --> 00:58:22.726]  Stone admitted on Jones' show, LA Times, New York Times.
[00:58:23.632 --> 00:58:31.554]  That he would be faithful and would not roll on the president, they left out the rest of the quote, because there is nothing to roll on him about.
[00:58:31.554 --> 00:58:32.654]  He did nothing.
[00:58:32.654 --> 00:58:33.994]  I did not talk to him about it.
[00:58:33.994 --> 00:58:35.175]  I was there, folks.
[00:58:35.175 --> 00:58:36.055]  I remember.
[00:58:36.055 --> 00:58:37.655]  Everything Roger said was true.
[00:58:37.655 --> 00:58:39.276]  So, political prisoner Clemency.
[00:58:39.276 --> 00:58:42.076]  We're going to cover the waterfront in the next hour.
[00:58:42.076 --> 00:58:45.197]  Roger, let's talk about this first before we get into everything next segment.
[00:58:45.197 --> 00:58:49.418]  Talk about what it's like to be, you know, the most infamous man in America.
[00:58:50.575 --> 00:58:52.976]  Well, it's both great and it's very bad.
[00:58:52.976 --> 00:59:00.881]  I mean, the point is, of course, that true patriots, and I think we are a slim majority in this country, realize that I did the right thing.
[00:59:00.881 --> 00:59:16.809]  Realize that I was pressured, both legally and financially, to lie about the president, to bear false witness against him, to repeat testimony composed for me by the prosecutors so they could use it to impeach Donald Trump.
[00:59:16.809 --> 00:59:18.270]  The timing here is very important.
[00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:23.777]  It happens just before the release of the Mueller Report, which is a nothing burger.
[00:59:23.777 --> 00:59:30.606]  So they're looking for me to be the ham in their ham sandwich because they have nothing on the Russian collusion hoax.
[00:59:30.606 --> 00:59:34.331]  And they want me to, you know, essentially be their star witness.
[00:59:35.254 --> 00:59:42.581]  And they hint about leniency and, you know, maybe the judge will let you go without any jail time and so on.
[00:59:42.581 --> 00:59:58.296]  Now you have Andrew Weissman, who is the guy who really ought to be in front of the grand jury, an epically corrupt former prosecutor cited by federal judges in multiple cases for misconduct and for ethical problems, saying, oh, we can still get the truth out of Roger Stone.
[00:59:58.296 --> 00:59:59.197]  Believe me, Andrew,
[00:59:59.904 --> 01:00:01.185]  You had a search warrant.
[01:00:01.185 --> 01:00:16.656]  You went through all of my emails, all of my text messages, all of my phone messages, all of my paper records, which you presumably grabbed when you raided my apartment and my office and my home, and you found nothing, because there's nothing to find.
[01:00:17.356 --> 01:00:21.339]  I know of no wrongdoing by the President of the United States.
[01:00:21.339 --> 01:00:25.382]  I know of no misconduct by the President of the United States.
[01:00:25.382 --> 01:00:26.203]  Let me repeat it again.
[01:00:26.203 --> 01:00:39.972]  And by the way, you've said that probably 500 times on my show, and then they misquote you and cut, I mean, this is really defamation when they even quote you on my show and go, on Jones' show, he admits that he will not turn on the President.
[01:00:39.972 --> 01:00:43.355]  Because, then you add it, because there's nothing to say, there's nothing.
[01:00:44.674 --> 01:00:45.616]  That's exactly right.
[01:00:45.616 --> 01:00:47.038]  So it's a reinvention.
[01:00:47.038 --> 01:00:50.963]  First of all, we're all the way back to Guccifer 2.0, all right?
[01:00:50.963 --> 01:00:57.853]  So Mueller says, Stone communicated with a Russian intelligence agent known to us.
[01:00:58.908 --> 01:01:01.330]  Well, first of all, let's be very clear.
[01:01:01.330 --> 01:01:09.235]  My communications with Guccifer 2.0 on Twitter Direct Message, I made it public completely in 2017.
[01:01:09.235 --> 01:01:10.455]  It's benign.
[01:01:10.455 --> 01:01:15.158]  It took place after WikiLeaks had already published all of their material.
[01:01:15.158 --> 01:01:18.781]  And I use that to say you perjured yourself because you talked to somebody that might have seen a Russian once.
[01:01:19.622 --> 01:01:22.664]  Well, what they're claiming is that he's a Russian intelligence agent.
[01:01:22.664 --> 01:01:23.885]  They haven't even proven that.
[01:01:23.885 --> 01:01:27.287]  That comes from the demented mind of John Brennan.
[01:01:27.287 --> 01:01:28.248]  We don't know that that's true.
[01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:57.125]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years.
[01:01:57.125 --> 01:02:09.929]  And if you go back to those shows, we laid out the AI takeover plan, the tracking of cell phones, how programmed master computers would manipulate control society, how they'd be able to not just predict,
[01:02:10.469 --> 01:02:11.170]  I don't know.
[01:02:30.484 --> 01:02:34.466]  But when we cover that, the media would attack us and say we were making it up.
[01:02:34.466 --> 01:02:39.709]  It was a conspiracy theory, even though it was in the actual corporate-level blueprint documents.
[01:02:39.709 --> 01:02:47.894]  Well, the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out.
[01:02:47.894 --> 01:02:51.396]  And it's something about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned.
[01:02:51.396 --> 01:02:53.437]  So we might want to dismantle the system now.
[01:03:10.362 --> 01:03:13.004]  Well, it's high noon Central Texas time.
[01:03:13.004 --> 01:03:18.129]  Broadcasting Worldwide and Roger Stone is giving us the first big in-depth interview.
[01:03:18.129 --> 01:03:20.091]  Very honored he went on.
[01:03:20.091 --> 01:03:32.301]  Kennedy last night laid out a lot of important things but now he's here in the next 45 minutes or so in his own words to set the record straight because they're still saying he's a Russian agent.
[01:03:32.301 --> 01:03:35.544]  They're saying I'm a Russian agent in Congress with zero proof.
[01:03:35.544 --> 01:03:35.885]  They are
[01:03:37.005 --> 01:03:37.805]  Here's the New York Times.
[01:03:37.805 --> 01:03:40.107]  We can still get the truth from Roger Stone.
[01:03:40.107 --> 01:03:42.508]  They want him called back in before grand juries.
[01:03:42.508 --> 01:03:44.109]  They want him re-indicted.
[01:03:44.109 --> 01:03:45.489]  New York Times.
[01:03:45.489 --> 01:03:45.910]  Schiff.
[01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:51.072]  Anyone who cares about the rule of law in this country is nauseated by Stone's sentence computation.
[01:03:51.072 --> 01:04:00.317]  Here it is, the executive grant of clemency and the seal right there of the Department of Justice with the President's signature right there.
[01:04:00.317 --> 01:04:03.179]  Then you've got George Stephanopoulos who presided over the Clintons and
[01:04:04.119 --> 01:04:12.001]  Obama and all these criminal activities and pardons of drug dealers and money launderers and people, but oh, that's okay.
[01:04:12.001 --> 01:04:16.642]  Had Dems' outrage over Stone, computation forgotten to the Clintons and Obama's pardon.
[01:04:16.642 --> 01:04:18.543]  Roger Stone has the floor.
[01:04:18.543 --> 01:04:21.564]  Right now, Roger, plow into it and why it's more important than ever.
[01:04:21.564 --> 01:04:23.264]  And by the way, good to see you there as a free man.
[01:04:24.312 --> 01:04:31.697]  Well, it's great to be free because, as you know, the judge in my case was intent on sending me to a COVID-19 infested prison.
[01:04:31.697 --> 01:04:36.941]  There are now 60 confirmed cases of COVID at that prison.
[01:04:36.941 --> 01:04:38.382]  I'm 67 years old.
[01:04:38.382 --> 01:04:44.947]  She's seen all my health records because you have to file them in your pre-sentence period.
[01:04:44.947 --> 01:04:46.048]  This was a death sentence.
[01:04:46.048 --> 01:04:46.728]  There's no question.
[01:04:46.728 --> 01:04:48.109]  And you would have been in jail right now.
[01:04:48.109 --> 01:04:49.310]  You would have been in prison right now.
[01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:52.642]  That is correct.
[01:04:52.642 --> 01:04:53.123]  Today.
[01:04:53.123 --> 01:04:54.626]  Today was the day.
[01:04:54.626 --> 01:05:01.498]  So, the President's commutation needs to be viewed, I think, first and foremost, as a humanitarian act of mercy.
[01:05:02.105 --> 01:05:04.846]  Because I wouldn't have lived long enough to pursue my appeal.
[01:05:04.846 --> 01:05:15.030]  I want to clear my name and I want to expose the epic corruption that surrounds my trial by the prosecutors, by the jury, all of it.
[01:05:15.030 --> 01:05:21.353]  And therefore, you know, I wouldn't live to get to an appeal if the deep state had their way.
[01:05:21.873 --> 01:05:32.684]  So I'm very grateful to God, I'm very grateful to the President, who I believe received divine guidance to do the right thing, although I think he would have done the right thing, but I'm very grateful to both of them.
[01:05:33.283 --> 01:05:35.644]  This was a death match, Alex.
[01:05:35.644 --> 01:05:37.784]  This was a death penalty.
[01:05:37.784 --> 01:05:42.806]  They want to silence me, and above all, they want me off the battlefield in 2020.
[01:05:42.806 --> 01:05:53.509]  They want to make sure that I was locked up someplace in ill health, maybe even kill me before the election, so that I couldn't do anything to aid the President in his re-election bid.
[01:05:53.509 --> 01:05:55.670]  This is the last grasp by the globalists.
[01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:57.950]  They want to grab it all and take it back.
[01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:59.911]  That's what this was really about.
[01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:18.691]  And the notion that I had some detrimental information or I knew of misconduct or illegal activity by the president and that I covered it up or lied about it in return for an act of clemency is a bald-faced lie.
[01:06:19.211 --> 01:06:31.095]  Robert Mueller is saying it, Andrew Weissman, his pit bull, who's more like a French poodle if you ask me, and Rod Rosenstein.
[01:06:31.095 --> 01:06:33.455]  This guy Rosenstein's really clever.
[01:06:33.455 --> 01:06:41.318]  He takes a quote out of Mueller's screed in the Washington Post and then he selectively edits it so it's no longer
[01:06:42.432 --> 01:06:47.960]  Stone was in touch with a Russian intelligence officer known to us.
[01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:52.526]  It now becomes Stone was in touch with a known Russian intelligence agent.
[01:06:52.526 --> 01:06:53.687]  You see the difference?
[01:06:53.687 --> 01:07:00.176]  It implies that I knowingly reached out to someone who was a Russian intelligence officer, which of course I didn't.
[01:07:01.097 --> 01:07:18.408]  This is a recap of an entirely benign narrative in which after the election, pardon me, after the publication of all the WikiLeaks documents, I had a perfectly benign exchange with Guccifer 2.0 on Twitter direct message.
[01:07:18.408 --> 01:07:19.669]  It's a persona.
[01:07:19.669 --> 01:07:26.453]  Now, if you look at the content of all those messages, there's no evidence of collaboration or collusion or cooperation.
[01:07:26.453 --> 01:07:29.115]  It's benign and it happened after the fact.
[01:07:29.475 --> 01:07:31.937]  And it's the only communication there is.
[01:07:31.937 --> 01:07:37.702]  So it's proof of nothing, number one, based on timing and content.
[01:07:37.702 --> 01:07:45.289]  And then the assertion that this entity is a Russian intelligence agent, that's a claim of John Brennan and the CIA.
[01:07:45.289 --> 01:07:46.550]  Why would we believe it?
[01:07:46.550 --> 01:07:47.671]  We've seen no proof of it.
[01:07:47.671 --> 01:07:47.991]  In fact,
[01:07:48.618 --> 01:07:59.031]  If you go to StoneColdTruth.com, my website, I've written and others have written thousands of words to demonstrate that the forensic evidence is much to the contrary.
[01:07:59.031 --> 01:08:07.161]  Most likely, Guccifer 2.0 is actually a US intelligence asset.
[01:08:07.737 --> 01:08:21.803]  So this whole narrative is being recycled, whether it's Adam Schiff, a guy who can't tell the truth if it would save his life, whether it is Rod Rosenstein, whether it is Robert Mueller, now Andrew Weissman.
[01:08:21.803 --> 01:08:24.464]  Weissman says, let's drag Stone in front of a grand jury.
[01:08:24.464 --> 01:08:25.545]  Now, I've got a better idea.
[01:08:26.676 --> 01:08:29.737]  Let's drag Andrew Weissman in front of a grand jury.
[01:08:29.737 --> 01:08:31.278]  Because they are busted.
[01:08:31.278 --> 01:08:43.743]  The documents that were declassified through the heroic efforts of Rick Grinnell only weeks ago proved beyond dispute that the entire Russian collusion thing was a hoax.
[01:08:43.743 --> 01:08:47.325]  Proved within an absolute certainty
[01:08:48.084 --> 01:09:03.671]  That the entire thing was based on illegitimate, fraudulent, fabricated information paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats and assembled with the cooperation and the assistance of Russian intelligence.
[01:09:04.292 --> 01:09:08.234]  There is the real Russian collusion right there.
[01:09:08.234 --> 01:09:13.237]  So in my view, Andrew Weissman should be indicted for sedition and for treason.
[01:09:13.237 --> 01:09:15.839]  It's time for them to get him in front of the grand jury.
[01:09:15.839 --> 01:09:18.300]  Hopefully John Durham is going to do that.
[01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:21.142]  I have my doubts, but I'm still praying for it.
[01:09:21.142 --> 01:09:21.582]  Who knows?
[01:09:21.582 --> 01:09:23.724]  It might happen.
[01:09:23.724 --> 01:09:25.925]  And everything you said is true and on record.
[01:09:25.925 --> 01:09:27.806]  It's come out that Hillary knew it was Russians.
[01:09:27.806 --> 01:09:30.508]  It's incredible how they turn everything around on us.
[01:09:33.515 --> 01:09:37.312]  It really is, but it is also something I've never experienced in politics.
[01:09:37.312 --> 01:09:37.814]  In other words...
[01:09:38.689 --> 01:09:46.332]  The way it used to work is somebody would make a charge against you, you would respond, you'd document that you were telling the truth, and we would move on.
[01:09:46.332 --> 01:09:54.596]  These people keep recycling the same old BS again and again and again, and they're smart enough to know that most people just read the headline.
[01:09:54.596 --> 01:09:55.316]  You just hit the key.
[01:09:55.316 --> 01:09:56.477]  Let me explain this.
[01:09:56.477 --> 01:10:03.400]  You were on record on my show talking about talking to Guccifer 2.0 and trying to find out if they could talk to WikiLeaks or if they had any information.
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:04.100]  Everybody was doing it.
[01:10:05.356 --> 01:10:06.477]  Nothing wrong with that.
[01:10:06.477 --> 01:10:08.638]  Then years later, years later, it's on the news.
[01:10:08.638 --> 01:10:09.699]  I'm going from my memory.
[01:10:09.699 --> 01:10:10.779]  On the news, breaking!
[01:10:10.779 --> 01:10:15.962]  He was talking to Guccifer like it was brand new when you brought it out at the time.
[01:10:15.962 --> 01:10:18.804]  I released, I released the entire exchange to the press in 2017.
[01:10:18.804 --> 01:10:20.325]  I was the first person to do it.
[01:10:20.325 --> 01:10:23.827]  That's what I'm saying, but even this year they were bringing it out like it was some new thing.
[01:10:23.827 --> 01:10:26.649]  That's what you're saying is they just, they know people don't have a memory.
[01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:29.312]  That's right.
[01:10:29.312 --> 01:10:35.643]  So they go for the headline, Trump associate admits contact with Russian intelligence agent.
[01:10:35.643 --> 01:10:37.246]  It's completely bogus.
[01:10:37.246 --> 01:10:37.747]  It's false.
[01:10:37.747 --> 01:10:39.029]  It was false then.
[01:10:39.029 --> 01:10:40.071]  It's false now.
[01:10:41.161 --> 01:10:44.282]  They don't understand how thin it wears on the American people.
[01:10:44.282 --> 01:10:46.522]  There's no evidence of Russian collusion.
[01:10:46.522 --> 01:10:49.783]  There's no evidence of Russian assistance to the Trump campaign.
[01:10:49.783 --> 01:10:50.823]  It's a fantasy.
[01:10:50.823 --> 01:10:51.763]  It's a fraud.
[01:10:51.763 --> 01:10:52.903]  It's a canard.
[01:10:52.903 --> 01:10:55.984]  I want to get back to what you just brought up, since you went there.
[01:10:55.984 --> 01:10:59.505]  Durham, the investigation, the attempted coup on the President, you were the linchpin of that.
[01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:00.625]  It's all failed.
[01:11:00.625 --> 01:11:05.646]  But now they're back with new frauds and new hoaxes and new coups because they haven't gotten in trouble.
[01:11:05.646 --> 01:11:06.486]  What needs to happen now?
[01:11:07.915 --> 01:11:10.177]  Well, I mean, that's an excellent question.
[01:11:10.177 --> 01:11:13.301]  First of all, I don't understand why this is taking so long.
[01:11:13.301 --> 01:11:19.187]  First they were telling us that Durham would have a report in the spring, then it's the summer, now they're saying maybe it'll be next year.
[01:11:19.187 --> 01:11:23.071]  Well, next year we may or may not have a different president.
[01:11:23.071 --> 01:11:25.073]  You know, hopefully we will have the same president.
[01:11:25.433 --> 01:11:27.894]  Because he's the only one who can revive this economy.
[01:11:27.894 --> 01:11:28.715]  How do I know that?
[01:11:28.715 --> 01:11:30.215]  He's already done it once.
[01:11:30.215 --> 01:11:43.182]  A man who knows how to bring back the economy when everybody said it was hopeless, a man who gave us the strongest economy in our history, the strongest job growth, the strongest wage growth, the highest levels of employment,
[01:11:43.742 --> 01:11:45.463]  There's no question he knows how to do it.
[01:11:45.463 --> 01:11:47.084]  He's already done it once.
[01:11:47.084 --> 01:11:52.026]  Your alternative is a guy whose prescription will make the sick patient even sicker.
[01:11:52.026 --> 01:11:59.289]  Higher taxes, more regulation, big one-size-fits-all international trade deals that steal our jobs.
[01:11:59.289 --> 01:12:00.749]  Do we really want to go back to that?
[01:12:00.749 --> 01:12:03.050]  We know what it got us under Obama.
[01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:08.793]  So I really think this is a clear-cut choice for the voters, but this is going to be a very, very tough
[01:12:09.474 --> 01:12:10.695]  Hard fought election.
[01:12:10.695 --> 01:12:17.578]  And they're hoping that Durham will report nothing and that Joe Biden as president can sweep it under the rug.
[01:12:17.578 --> 01:12:19.399]  Let me make another point.
[01:12:19.399 --> 01:12:31.945]  Bill Barr has gotten two recommendations, referrals from two different Inspector General's reports recommending the indictment of James Comey for crimes that are far more serious than what I was charged with.
[01:12:31.945 --> 01:12:33.085]  Roger, let's leave it off there.
[01:12:34.266 --> 01:12:36.207]  Let's come back and get right into that.
[01:12:36.207 --> 01:12:38.507]  Roger's on fire, and his Skype is super clear.
[01:12:38.507 --> 01:12:41.188]  It's like he's right here in studio with us in Austin, but he's not.
[01:12:41.188 --> 01:12:42.348]  He's in Florida.
[01:12:42.348 --> 01:12:43.609]  Tell everybody you know, tune in.
[01:12:43.609 --> 01:12:44.529]  This is history.
[01:12:44.529 --> 01:12:48.990]  They wanted this man imprisoned and silenced to be the linchpin, the cherry on top of their whole fraud.
[01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:50.431]  Instead, it blew up in their face.
[01:12:50.431 --> 01:12:50.931]  Thank God.
[01:12:52.355 --> 01:12:58.999]  Much of the United States bureaucracy, all of Hollywood, and most of our media is under international banking control.
[01:12:58.999 --> 01:13:04.262]  The United Nations was set up by the Rothschilds and Rockefellers on record to carry out this operation.
[01:13:04.262 --> 01:13:09.306]  Now, under the guise of medical security, they're bringing us medical charity.
[01:13:10.146 --> 01:13:22.533]  That we see much of the federal government, the Democrats, the Republicans, all saying, except for Trump and a few people, that we need a nationwide force mask mandate to make everyone wear a mask.
[01:13:22.533 --> 01:13:27.236]  Even though just months ago we had the Surgeon General and others say, don't wear a mask, it's all a fraud.
[01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:29.737]  Now they say you must wear a mask.
[01:13:29.737 --> 01:13:31.318]  It's a sign of slavery.
[01:13:31.318 --> 01:13:32.439]  It's a sign of submission.
[01:13:32.439 --> 01:13:34.360]  I know you as listeners understand that.
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:38.042]  We need sheriffs and county commissioners and city councils and others to stand up and say,
[01:13:38.502 --> 01:13:45.649]  We are sanctuary cities for reality and for state and local sovereignty against the globalists.
[01:13:45.649 --> 01:13:51.354]  This isn't the federal government taking over, it's the UN through the federal government and we as American citizens must say no.
[01:13:51.354 --> 01:14:00.523]  The reasons that the globalists launch this planetary lockdown, the number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes.
[01:14:00.523 --> 01:14:04.146]  We've gone over those purposes many times here on air.
[01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:11.021]  The cashless society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, forced inoculation.
[01:14:11.021 --> 01:14:27.285]  But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential, as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had by design.
[01:14:27.285 --> 01:14:31.346]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[01:14:31.346 --> 01:14:34.067]  It's been pre-planned, organized, globally.
[01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:48.505]  It's extremely predatory and through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[01:14:48.505 --> 01:14:55.127]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[01:14:55.127 --> 01:14:57.768]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:04.198 --> 01:15:11.200]  What I hate is looking out and seeing chemtrails in a clear blue sky today.
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:24.585]  What I hate is hitting roadblocks on a highway in my way.
[01:15:30.014 --> 01:15:36.140]  What I live for is a chance to change and be everything I can be.
[01:15:38.956 --> 01:15:42.318]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are here broadcasting worldwide today.
[01:15:42.318 --> 01:15:44.039]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:15:44.039 --> 01:15:46.861]  Roger Stone is here with us exclusively for the rest of the hour.
[01:15:46.861 --> 01:15:48.402]  This is his first big in-depth interview.
[01:15:48.402 --> 01:15:51.504]  We're very thankful for him being here with us today.
[01:15:51.504 --> 01:15:57.668]  He's wearing his Roger Stone Still Did Nothing Wrong shirt and his free Roger Stone COVID-19 mask.
[01:15:57.668 --> 01:16:04.133]  Roger, getting back to this, we've been hearing for years, two weeks, two weeks, there's going to be indictments, two weeks, two weeks, the deep state's going to be punished.
[01:16:04.693 --> 01:16:05.953]  But instead we haven't seen that.
[01:16:05.953 --> 01:16:11.475]  Now we've seen Manafort finally sent to home confinement after he did nothing wrong.
[01:16:11.475 --> 01:16:13.676]  We've seen, you know, you getting clemency.
[01:16:13.676 --> 01:16:16.236]  And we hear calls for Trump's impeachment.
[01:16:16.236 --> 01:16:26.619]  I think President Trump needs to get on the offense here, as you've been talking about, with his bully pulpit and keep exposing these people or they're going to try for another coup attempt on the President.
[01:16:26.619 --> 01:16:31.901]  Well, Alex, first of all, now, like General Flynn, I am unmasked.
[01:16:31.901 --> 01:16:33.261]  Not quite the same way he was.
[01:16:34.450 --> 01:16:35.791]  You know, you're absolutely right.
[01:16:35.791 --> 01:16:41.893]  And the President's comments since he commuted my sentence have been right on the money.
[01:16:41.893 --> 01:16:46.595]  The investigation under which I was prosecuted was illegitimate.
[01:16:46.595 --> 01:16:49.676]  So how can my prosecution be legitimate?
[01:16:49.676 --> 01:16:53.057]  This is the classic fruit of the poison tree.
[01:16:53.057 --> 01:16:58.479]  And it is interesting that they only approved the investigation into me in October of 2017
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:05.261]  Three months after they knew there was no Russian collusion.
[01:17:05.261 --> 01:17:09.502]  There was no collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian state.
[01:17:09.502 --> 01:17:12.663]  It even proves beyond a shadow of a doubt.
[01:17:12.663 --> 01:17:16.043]  This is the guy Nick Ackerman, by the way, writing for the New York Times.
[01:17:16.043 --> 01:17:17.504]  I'm going to be suing him.
[01:17:17.504 --> 01:17:19.324]  He called me a Russian spy and a traitor.
[01:17:19.324 --> 01:17:24.525]  You know, even Roger Stone can be defamed and there is no such proof.
[01:17:24.525 --> 01:17:26.986]  He is the most irresponsible of all my critics.
[01:17:27.546 --> 01:17:29.387]  He's a former Watergate prosecutor.
[01:17:29.387 --> 01:17:33.468]  He has gone on TV to say, Nixon knew about the break-in.
[01:17:33.468 --> 01:17:34.548]  We just couldn't find it.
[01:17:34.548 --> 01:17:37.069]  Well, that means you have no proof of that claim.
[01:17:37.069 --> 01:17:39.350]  It happens, by the way, to be false.
[01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:42.551]  But just like in my situation, let's be clear.
[01:17:42.551 --> 01:17:52.174]  Andrew Weissman and the special counsels, Aaron Zelinsky, the guy who basically defrauded a House Judiciary Committee, whose testimony before the committee
[01:17:52.734 --> 01:18:00.219]  He wouldn't show up in person because he's very concerned about catching COVID, but he has no problems with my going to a COVID-invested prison.
[01:18:00.219 --> 01:18:07.904]  This guy's testimony was the most incredible blend of obfuscation, perjury, and hearsay I've ever heard.
[01:18:07.904 --> 01:18:13.028]  Oh, somebody told me the Attorney General was under pressure to give Stone special treatment.
[01:18:13.658 --> 01:18:15.639]  Well, Mr. Zelensky, who is somebody?
[01:18:15.639 --> 01:18:16.479]  Who told you?
[01:18:16.479 --> 01:18:17.940]  What person told you?
[01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:22.061]  It was really, it was very slimy and the guy had no proof whatsoever.
[01:18:22.061 --> 01:18:24.422]  That's because it didn't happen.
[01:18:24.422 --> 01:18:28.023]  Alex, you're in a situation where the president keeps pounding on this.
[01:18:28.023 --> 01:18:29.204]  He says it every time.
[01:18:29.204 --> 01:18:30.984]  He's defended his action.
[01:18:30.984 --> 01:18:33.305]  In my case, he has said that he did the right thing.
[01:18:33.305 --> 01:18:34.385]  He's right.
[01:18:34.385 --> 01:18:36.766]  He said that his supporters strongly support it.
[01:18:36.766 --> 01:18:38.127]  They do.
[01:18:38.127 --> 01:18:41.548]  I don't think there's a single voter out there who says
[01:18:42.804 --> 01:18:49.387]  Well, I was going to vote for Donald Trump, but now that he's saved Roger Stone's life, I'm not going to.
[01:18:49.387 --> 01:18:50.448]  Not a single voter.
[01:18:50.448 --> 01:18:52.128]  Not one.
[01:18:52.128 --> 01:18:56.911]  The outrage here from the left is they really thought they could get me off the battlefield in 2020.
[01:18:58.061 --> 01:19:09.767]  That they really thought that they could pay me back for the exposure of Hillary Clinton in my book, The Clinton's War on Women, which was, I think, a very important milestone in 2016.
[01:19:09.767 --> 01:19:22.174]  That you and I were out pushing the Clinton rape t-shirts, pointing out that Bill Clinton is a serial rapist, a serial sexual assaulter of women, but more importantly, it was Hillary Clinton
[01:19:22.853 --> 01:19:27.195]  Who was intimidating and bullying these women into silence.
[01:19:27.195 --> 01:19:33.718]  It was Hillary Clinton who hired the heavy-handed detectives and the nasty lawyers to threaten these women.
[01:19:33.718 --> 01:19:42.342]  And by the way they got really mad when we paid to send people, people got $2,000 prizes who would go scream you're a rapist to Bill Clinton's face.
[01:19:42.342 --> 01:19:43.463]  That happened hundreds of times.
[01:19:43.463 --> 01:19:45.804]  So this was about payback and it's also about
[01:19:46.264 --> 01:19:50.708]  Threatening anybody in the future, you better not support Trump, you better not advise him.
[01:19:50.708 --> 01:20:05.643]  Now we have the Council on Foreign Relations of the Washington Post last week saying, when he loses, if he contests the election, which Democrats are going to contest it, then we need the military to remove him and anybody that doesn't follow our orders in the deep state, you will go to prison.
[01:20:05.643 --> 01:20:06.764]  That's the Washington Post.
[01:20:06.764 --> 01:20:08.306]  So they're now, now this coup,
[01:20:09.967 --> 01:20:14.453]  Hasn't gotten in trouble, so now they're just spoiling for an all-out military coup.
[01:20:14.453 --> 01:20:19.780]  I mean, Trump and others, how can Trump move against them if he doesn't have the Justice Department doing the right thing?
[01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:24.326]  I mean, doesn't the Justice Department realize the danger of an all-out civil war if they let the deep state keep doing this?
[01:20:24.326 --> 01:20:24.987]  This is dangerous.
[01:20:25.697 --> 01:20:30.200]  Well, I mean, why is Aaron Zelensky working for the Trump Justice Department?
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:37.884]  You know, it's after he finished his persecution, not prosecution, persecution of me, he returns to his job as an assistant U.S.
[01:20:37.884 --> 01:20:39.204]  attorney in Baltimore.
[01:20:39.204 --> 01:20:47.209]  This guy needs to be not only fired, but he needs to be prosecuted in the Papadopoulos matter, where he clearly engaged in gross and provable misconduct.
[01:20:47.689 --> 01:20:53.233]  And there are issues in my case as well that will come up down the road when I file some complaints.
[01:20:53.233 --> 01:20:57.937]  But why are any of these people still working for the Trump Justice Department?
[01:20:57.937 --> 01:21:03.081]  This is the problem with not cleaning house as soon as he became president.
[01:21:03.081 --> 01:21:12.048]  You know, changing the cabinet officer but leaving everybody under them in place is like leaving a dirty diaper on a baby but changing the pins.
[01:21:12.048 --> 01:21:13.389]  It doesn't make any sense.
[01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:20.593]  And you've had, you know, many sectors of the Trump administration working against the President actively.
[01:21:20.593 --> 01:21:26.937]  We saw this in the Ukrainian scam put together hastily by Adam Schiff.
[01:21:26.937 --> 01:21:36.603]  Once they figured out their Russian collusion scam crashed and burned and was going nowhere because it was a fraud, then they hastily put together this Ukrainian nonsense.
[01:21:37.506 --> 01:21:39.247]  Who's testifying against the President?
[01:21:39.247 --> 01:21:40.887]  All of his own employees.
[01:21:40.887 --> 01:21:42.648]  All of his own appointees.
[01:21:42.648 --> 01:21:45.189]  These people are all in political appointee jobs.
[01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:46.609]  They're not bureaucrats.
[01:21:46.609 --> 01:21:47.690]  They're not civil servants.
[01:21:47.690 --> 01:21:48.630]  Roger, let me ask you this.
[01:21:48.630 --> 01:21:49.850]  They're dictators.
[01:21:49.850 --> 01:21:51.731]  How do you expect them to strike back at the President?
[01:21:51.731 --> 01:21:56.613]  I mean, so far they're demonizing red states and praising blue states and blaming cover on the President.
[01:21:56.613 --> 01:21:57.873]  That's asinine.
[01:21:57.873 --> 01:22:00.454]  So far they're trying to hurt the economy, keep things shut to do that.
[01:22:00.454 --> 01:22:01.974]  They admit that's their plan.
[01:22:01.974 --> 01:22:03.435]  How else are they going to come at him, do you think?
[01:22:04.571 --> 01:22:06.654]  Well, I mean, we have anarchy in the streets.
[01:22:06.654 --> 01:22:08.956]  You show better footage of it than anybody does.
[01:22:08.956 --> 01:22:14.403]  We have a situation in which law-abiding citizens are afraid to leave their home.
[01:22:14.403 --> 01:22:18.668]  Now they're afraid to defend their homes because they might be indicted for it.
[01:22:18.668 --> 01:22:23.054]  The prosecutors seem to be on the side of the radicals rather than on the side of the citizens.
[01:22:23.776 --> 01:22:24.798]  It's very scary.
[01:22:24.798 --> 01:22:32.067]  Incredible interviews with Tucker Carlson last night from the couple that defended their own home with their legal firearms.
[01:22:32.067 --> 01:22:34.249]  And now got raided by the police.
[01:22:34.249 --> 01:22:36.752]  It's unbelievable.
[01:22:36.752 --> 01:22:39.216]  Well obviously Soros has put in hundreds of
[01:22:40.526 --> 01:22:43.267]  County attorneys and city attorneys, district attorneys.
[01:22:43.267 --> 01:22:49.051]  He's put in hundreds and hundreds of police chiefs and mayors and he's like the real shadow president.
[01:22:49.051 --> 01:22:51.372]  He brags now that he's got control of most cities.
[01:22:51.372 --> 01:22:53.813]  I mean, are we just gonna let Soros do this?
[01:22:53.813 --> 01:22:55.314]  Why the hell is Soros so powerful?
[01:22:56.556 --> 01:22:57.696]  It's an excellent question.
[01:22:57.696 --> 01:22:59.877]  I was on Fox not long ago.
[01:22:59.877 --> 01:23:00.937]  We're doing an interview.
[01:23:00.937 --> 01:23:02.758]  I'm not going to tell you with whom.
[01:23:02.758 --> 01:23:08.739]  And just before we went on, in my earpiece, the producer came on and said, oh, one more thing, Mr. Stone.
[01:23:08.739 --> 01:23:12.900]  Under no circumstances can you mention George Soros.
[01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:14.300]  And I said, well, I wasn't going to.
[01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:18.101]  This is not related to the topic I'm here to discuss.
[01:23:18.101 --> 01:23:20.542]  And they said, well, we just wanted you to understand our policy.
[01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:22.710]  This makes no sense to me.
[01:23:22.710 --> 01:23:24.911]  I cannot explain why that would be the case.
[01:23:24.911 --> 01:23:29.974]  Well, he's untouchable, and that's exactly what I've been told by people at Fox.
[01:23:29.974 --> 01:23:30.595]  We're going to come back.
[01:23:30.595 --> 01:23:41.541]  Let's talk about, though, your personal life, where you're going, why we need to get you vindicated with the clemency, and let's also talk about your personal relationship with Jesus Christ and how God's helped bring you through this.
[01:23:41.541 --> 01:23:44.903]  Roger Stone is with us for two more segments.
[01:23:44.903 --> 01:23:49.626]  This is historical, what's happened, and I want to thank the listeners for supporting Roger Stone because we're all in this together.
[01:23:50.709 --> 01:24:08.446]  Imagine telling someone just a year ago that in the middle of 2020, the Democrats, as well as many Republican leaders, will be calling for the United Nations WHO edict that all Americans wear masks, be a quote, federal order and mandate.
[01:24:08.446 --> 01:24:11.949]  Totally unconstitutional, annihilating states' rights.
[01:24:13.050 --> 01:24:13.851]  Think about that.
[01:24:13.851 --> 01:24:15.972]  A woman can kill her baby.
[01:24:15.972 --> 01:24:18.354]  We pay for illegal aliens healthcare.
[01:24:18.354 --> 01:24:27.140]  But you've got to wear a mask for a virus that killed 20 plus times less than what they said, even if you believe the official story.
[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:30.402]  This is about the WHO, the globalists, testing their power.
[01:24:30.982 --> 01:24:35.943]  Through the media, over the federal government, to set policy in the United States.
[01:24:35.943 --> 01:24:41.145]  This is our punishment for not going with the carbon taxes and the Paris Accord and all of it.
[01:24:41.145 --> 01:24:42.705]  And by the way, they admit that.
[01:24:42.705 --> 01:24:48.127]  They say, now your carbon's down one way or another, you stupid Americans.
[01:24:50.376 --> 01:24:52.018]  It's finally here.
[01:24:52.018 --> 01:24:56.121]  Introducing the new Survival Shield X2 Spray.

[01:26:52.794 --> 01:26:55.415]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:27:08.757 --> 01:27:11.259]  We're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:27:11.259 --> 01:27:11.800]  to 3 p.m.
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:12.681]  Central.
[01:27:12.681 --> 01:27:13.682]  And then we have the War Room.
[01:27:13.682 --> 01:27:19.108]  The War Room with Owen Schroyer and formerly Roger Stone, but he became a political prisoner.
[01:27:20.051 --> 01:27:30.863]  They SWAT teamed him, helicopters, attack boats, stole everything he had, lost his house, spent three million dollars battling all the lawsuits, all the subpoenas, not just the criminal stuff.
[01:27:30.863 --> 01:27:36.148]  And believe me, folks, we have fought over 50 Democratic Party lawsuits, knocked out
[01:27:37.114 --> 01:27:39.696]  Forty-three of them.
[01:27:39.696 --> 01:27:44.900]  And we have the Georgetown University Democratic Party all officially trying to destroy us.
[01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:49.703]  And they just keep with judges going, give us the secret documents where you're funded by the Russians.
[01:27:49.703 --> 01:27:51.964]  Give us the secret documents with the Mercers.
[01:27:51.964 --> 01:27:55.447]  Give us who commands you, who writes your scripts.
[01:27:55.447 --> 01:27:56.608]  Who writes my scripts?
[01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:58.550]  I want to digress.
[01:27:58.550 --> 01:28:08.855]  Roger Stone is about to do some major history here, and I've been hoping as soon as he gets out from under the sniper, he'll start co-hosting with Owen again, his co-host from the war room that Steve Bannon stole the name from.
[01:28:08.855 --> 01:28:15.018]  Again, folks, the thing is about Steve Bannon, he reports everything we report six months later and then just pontificates around.
[01:28:15.018 --> 01:28:16.139]  I'm sick of it!
[01:28:16.139 --> 01:28:25.403]  And he lied and literally perjured himself before Congress to put Roger in prison, or he told the truth before Congress, perjured himself in the criminal trial before Judge Amy Berman Jackson.
[01:28:25.403 --> 01:28:25.964]  This has been a
[01:28:26.944 --> 01:28:33.747]  Nightmare, dystopic tragedy, like a Greek tragedy, but we're living it!
[01:28:33.747 --> 01:28:36.127]  I had the FBI investigate my father.
[01:28:36.127 --> 01:28:41.789]  I had the Washington Post call up and say, your father's paying hush money for Roger Stone.
[01:28:41.789 --> 01:28:43.850]  I had to go see the FBI.
[01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:46.391]  I'm not supposed to get into all this, I'm just going to stop here.
[01:28:46.391 --> 01:28:51.013]  I'm not a victim, I'm a target, but let me tell you, my family killed Russians.
[01:28:51.733 --> 01:28:53.694]  Okay, and Latin American stuff.
[01:28:53.694 --> 01:28:54.494]  I'm 1776.
[01:28:54.494 --> 01:28:56.655]  Everybody knows that, okay?
[01:28:56.655 --> 01:28:59.056]  This whole idea is ridiculous.
[01:28:59.056 --> 01:29:02.377]  Roger Stone is a famous right-winger that came out of Nixon.
[01:29:02.377 --> 01:29:06.879]  He helped round up a Russian spy ring in Washington in the 80s.
[01:29:06.879 --> 01:29:08.519]  He's famous for that.
[01:29:08.519 --> 01:29:09.540]  It's like saying...
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:16.344]  Clark Kent works for Lex Luthor, or, or, or, I mean, it's just over the top, but they just keep doing it.
[01:29:16.344 --> 01:29:20.467]  So, Roger, you've been inside InfoWars, you've seen the guts of it, you've seen the operation.
[01:29:20.467 --> 01:29:22.388]  Is anyone telling us what to say or what to do?
[01:29:23.585 --> 01:29:33.811]  You can obviously tell, Alex, that we were all completely and totally unscripted, and there was no time that I worked there that you ever said to me, you can't say this, you can't say that.
[01:29:33.811 --> 01:29:41.195]  Now, you did tell me you didn't want to talk about Russia as much as I did, but I had no choice, because I realized at that point it was their master plan.
[01:29:41.195 --> 01:29:42.756]  No, no, you were proven right.
[01:29:42.756 --> 01:29:43.796]  You were proven right.
[01:29:43.796 --> 01:29:46.878]  I started getting we had to defend ourselves when they were criminally investigating me.
[01:29:46.878 --> 01:29:48.719]  I was like, oh, this is important now, yeah.
[01:29:49.966 --> 01:29:54.752]  So I'm going to do something very historic now, right on the air here at InfoWars.
[01:29:54.752 --> 01:30:00.499]  I'm going to actually sign my acceptance of the commutation by the President of the United States.
[01:30:00.499 --> 01:30:01.760]  There you see it.
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:04.283]  It is not signed.
[01:30:04.283 --> 01:30:05.925]  This is a historic moment.
[01:30:05.925 --> 01:30:08.809]  This is the document that saves my life.
[01:30:09.629 --> 01:30:12.712]  It now has my signature on it, as you can see.
[01:30:12.712 --> 01:30:14.413]  And there it is.
[01:30:14.413 --> 01:30:28.005]  So I have accepted the act of mercy, the act of justice by a benevolent president, a man who believes deeply in justice, who believes in fairness, who knows I did not get a fair trial.
[01:30:28.505 --> 01:30:33.830]  Who knows, I was subjected to a Soviet-style show trial before a kangaroo court.
[01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:34.831]  It wasn't a trial.
[01:30:34.831 --> 01:30:37.093]  It was more like a lynching.
[01:30:37.093 --> 01:30:38.855]  I mean, Owen Schroer was there.
[01:30:38.855 --> 01:30:40.396]  He saw it with his own eyes.
[01:30:40.396 --> 01:30:42.659]  It was like a lynching.
[01:30:42.659 --> 01:30:44.240]  And you could see these jurors.
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:46.262]  You could see the hate in their eyes.
[01:30:46.262 --> 01:30:49.225]  You could see the joy in their eyes when the prosecutors
[01:30:49.465 --> 01:30:51.887]  They even wrote op-eds bashing you.
[01:30:51.887 --> 01:30:53.488]  No juror's ever done that.
[01:30:53.488 --> 01:30:59.212]  They're in the Washington Post bashing you and I after you're convicted, but then we're not allowed to say their names.
[01:30:59.212 --> 01:31:02.375]  We're terrorizing them when we talk about it.
[01:31:02.375 --> 01:31:11.362]  The amazing thing is when we raised the question of the jury for a woman's misconduct, the judge held a hearing.
[01:31:11.362 --> 01:31:16.105]  And in that hearing, she said, I'm not going to question the entire jury.
[01:31:16.105 --> 01:31:18.187]  I'm going to take a sampling of two jurors.
[01:31:18.727 --> 01:31:31.217]  And one of the two she selected was the juror who wrote the op-ed piece for the Washington Post talking about how everything was done perfectly right, and that Stone was not a political hit, and the jury was diverse.
[01:31:31.217 --> 01:31:32.177]  Yeah, it was diverse.
[01:31:32.177 --> 01:31:41.184]  It was, you know, there were no Republicans, no Libertarians, no Independents, no working class people, no military veterans.
[01:31:41.184 --> 01:31:44.347]  It was a hanging jury, and it was designed to be one.
[01:31:44.964 --> 01:31:49.914]  So, it is good to know that we have a president who stands up for the rule of law.
[01:31:50.945 --> 01:31:58.827]  Watching these Democrats like Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler and Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi running around talking about the rule of law.
[01:31:58.827 --> 01:31:59.707]  The rule of law?
[01:31:59.707 --> 01:32:01.588]  How about this?
[01:32:01.588 --> 01:32:14.831]  The abuse of power by Barack Obama's administration, including his National Security Advisor, his Vice President, his National Security Advisor, his CIA Director, his FBI Director,
[01:32:15.471 --> 01:32:16.812]  Let's go back to early 2017.
[01:32:16.812 --> 01:32:18.372]  We, you and I, it's not about bragging, it's about facts.
[01:32:44.670 --> 01:32:47.255]  Pioneered!
[01:32:47.255 --> 01:32:48.737]  Pioneered!
[01:32:48.737 --> 01:32:55.268]  Exposing how he was being spied on, how they were doing it, the FISA court, from your sources and my sources, that also drove them into a total rage.
[01:32:56.821 --> 01:33:01.585]  I remember how they vilified Judge Andrew Napolitano, my longtime friend.
[01:33:01.585 --> 01:33:04.107]  I've known him for almost 40 years.
[01:33:04.107 --> 01:33:05.948]  They vilified him when he said that.
[01:33:05.948 --> 01:33:10.411]  You know, nobody comes back and says later, gee, Judge, we apologize, you were right.
[01:33:10.411 --> 01:33:16.156]  The guy took a weekend off and the fake news media says Napolitano's been fired from Fox.
[01:33:16.716 --> 01:33:22.940]  This man has more integrity in his little finger than the New York Times has in every single employee they have.
[01:33:22.940 --> 01:33:26.403]  Roger, let's talk big picture before we gotta go to break and come back and play.
[01:33:26.403 --> 01:33:30.545]  Hillary attacked you on Trevor Noah, the Not Funny Show, and all the rest of it.
[01:33:30.545 --> 01:33:32.287]  I know you lost your nice house.
[01:33:32.287 --> 01:33:33.447]  I know your finances.
[01:33:33.447 --> 01:33:34.988]  I know you basically don't have any money.
[01:33:34.988 --> 01:33:38.191]  I know that you have spent, what, three million dollars on lawyers.
[01:33:39.131 --> 01:33:40.452]  Of course.
[01:33:40.452 --> 01:33:42.593]  And so, that's what I thought, estimated.
[01:33:42.593 --> 01:33:46.214]  And so, I understand that you really, really need people's support.
[01:33:46.214 --> 01:33:51.277]  They should all buy a Roger Stone, still did nothing wrong, the ultimate triggering shirt on your website.
[01:33:51.277 --> 01:33:53.938]  And I want to thank all the listeners that did donate to you.
[01:33:53.938 --> 01:33:58.580]  How do people continue to support in this critical fight to really upend the deep state?
[01:33:58.580 --> 01:34:00.801]  And then separately, let's talk about who really gets the credit.
[01:34:01.441 --> 01:34:13.872]  You with Billy Graham's son and going to that crusade and really already knew Christ but really finding Christ again stronger than ever, putting your faith in Christ and how the tide totally turned once you did that.
[01:34:13.872 --> 01:34:15.974]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:34:15.974 --> 01:34:17.615]  You almost don't know where to start.
[01:34:17.615 --> 01:34:23.941]  The first thing they do in one of these processes is they break you financially so you no longer have the resources to fight them.
[01:34:24.392 --> 01:34:25.774]  So you're right, I've lost everything.
[01:34:25.774 --> 01:34:39.012]  I've lost my home, I've lost one of my cars, I lost most of my insurance, I lost my savings, and for 16 months I've been unable to work because essentially I work by speaking and writing and I was gagged and the only thing people
[01:34:39.392 --> 01:34:47.536]  We're interested in speaking and writing, having me speak and write about where my trial and my ordeal, which I was prohibited from doing.
[01:34:47.536 --> 01:34:49.097]  So yes, I've lost everything.
[01:34:49.097 --> 01:34:53.218]  Those who want to help me can go to StoneFamilyFund.com.
[01:34:53.218 --> 01:34:55.640]  StoneFamilyFund.com.
[01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:57.060]  That's for groceries.
[01:34:57.060 --> 01:34:58.601]  That's for gasoline.
[01:34:58.601 --> 01:34:59.881]  That's for utilities.
[01:34:59.881 --> 01:35:02.963]  That's for medical expenses and prescription drugs.
[01:35:03.553 --> 01:35:07.976]  Folks, I am not living a lavish lifestyle high on the hog.
[01:35:07.976 --> 01:35:13.060]  So if you want to help us again, StoneFamilyFund.com.
[01:35:13.060 --> 01:35:16.663]  And believe me, it will be a godsend because I got to worry about the rent next month.

[01:35:25.201 --> 01:35:27.261]  That's fightback.store.
[01:35:27.261 --> 01:35:31.603]  And by the way, the guy that makes your shirts got banned on Facebook and lost a bunch of his accounts.
[01:35:31.603 --> 01:35:32.583]  They're harassing everyone.
[01:35:32.583 --> 01:35:34.523]  And you've still got to go through clemency.
[01:35:34.523 --> 01:35:42.006]  You've still got to go to the Court of Appeals to overturn this monster, Amy Berman Jackson, or they're going to keep saying that you were really convicted of working with the Russians.
[01:35:42.967 --> 01:35:43.428]  It's true.
[01:35:43.428 --> 01:35:45.690]  I have an appeal which needs to be funded.
[01:35:45.690 --> 01:35:52.278]  And therefore, if you want to help me in that epic struggle, you can go to stonedefensefund.com.
[01:35:52.278 --> 01:35:55.101]  That's stonedefensefund.com.
[01:35:55.101 --> 01:35:55.982]  There it is.
[01:35:55.982 --> 01:35:59.086]  Let's talk about Christ, though, because, I mean, how did things change when you did that?
[01:36:00.329 --> 01:36:02.150]  Overnight, literally overnight.
[01:36:02.150 --> 01:36:04.832]  I had an opportunity to meet Reverend Franklin Graham.
[01:36:04.832 --> 01:36:06.033]  I jumped at it.
[01:36:06.033 --> 01:36:09.014]  He gave me the most solid advice you could give anybody.
[01:36:09.014 --> 01:36:21.802]  He said, you're right son, you're in big trouble, but if you will just confess your sins, if you will be reborn, if you will get right with Christ, if you will reaffirm your commitment to the Lord,
[01:36:23.205 --> 01:36:23.986]  You will see.
[01:36:23.986 --> 01:36:24.987]  He will protect you.
[01:36:24.987 --> 01:36:26.648]  He will never abandon you.
[01:36:26.648 --> 01:36:29.170]  He will be with you in your moment of need.
[01:36:29.170 --> 01:36:33.153]  And you can erase all worry and you no longer need to be afraid.
[01:36:33.153 --> 01:36:35.815]  That very day, I did what Reverend Graham suggested.
[01:36:35.815 --> 01:36:38.057]  I stood up to 500 others.
[01:36:38.057 --> 01:36:42.680]  I confessed my sins and I pledged to sin no more to the best of my ability.
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:44.502]  And Alex, that was a Saturday.
[01:36:44.502 --> 01:36:45.522]  On Monday morning... Stay there.
[01:36:45.522 --> 01:36:46.843]  Let's talk about Roger Stone.
[01:36:46.843 --> 01:36:48.124]  We've got to go to break.
[01:36:48.124 --> 01:36:48.365]  Stay there.
[01:36:48.365 --> 01:36:49.405]  We'll finish up in a couple of minutes.
[01:36:52.068 --> 01:37:04.418]  Things are going to be so incredibly fair and wonderful because an all-seeing, all-loving computer that doesn't discriminate is going to decide who gets what resources, who gets what jobs.
[01:37:04.418 --> 01:37:18.088]  But in reality, it's building a post-human world so that you can be made obsolete, domesticated, dumbed down, drugged, distracted, atomized, and then slowly killed.
[01:37:18.088 --> 01:37:20.170]  This is the brave new world.
[01:37:20.908 --> 01:37:22.509]  It's the post-human world.
[01:37:22.509 --> 01:37:29.554]  It's the dreaming of the post-human world that Wired Magazine and the Wall Street Journal all tell us about.
[01:37:29.554 --> 01:37:32.736]  Oh, now they tell us our smartphones don't just track our every move.
[01:37:32.736 --> 01:37:38.340]  They're monitoring our psychology and sending it back to a corporate database globally.
[01:37:38.340 --> 01:37:48.046]  You see, the bear trap closed on our lead now, and the vampire walked out of the bushes and is explaining to us how he's slowly going to bleed us and destroy us.
[01:37:48.846 --> 01:37:59.175]  The bad news is Western governments have totally let multinational big tech bring in communist Chinese style total net surveillance censorship with AI.
[01:37:59.175 --> 01:38:03.879]  The good news is they had to do that to carry out this world government COVID takeover.
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:12.922]  This planetary corporate reset that COVID covers for, because the truth is powerful and will defeat them and will smash them.
[01:38:12.922 --> 01:38:32.807]  And the good news is there's still sites like band.video, newswars.com, infowars.com, paulwatsonsitesummit.news, and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive traffic thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen, that is the master of our own
[01:38:33.467 --> 01:38:34.488]  Destinies.
[01:38:34.488 --> 01:38:41.435]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality, a war on civilization, a war on our health, a war on our economy.
[01:38:41.435 --> 01:38:45.920]  But being aware of it, and standing up to it, and speaking out against it, will defeat it.
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:48.022]  So take action, or be slaves!
[01:38:50.305 --> 01:38:54.268]  Food is again available for shipping within three to four weeks.
[01:38:54.268 --> 01:38:54.889]  We have it.
[01:38:54.889 --> 01:38:58.371]  It's high quality, but it's got to be packaged and shipped out to you.
[01:38:58.371 --> 01:39:00.573]  Some items are shipping in a week, some in four weeks.
[01:39:00.573 --> 01:39:02.274]  So they're saying three to four weeks.
[01:39:02.274 --> 01:39:03.335]  It's my Patriot.
[01:39:03.335 --> 01:39:04.396]  We have their full catalog.
[01:39:04.396 --> 01:39:07.298]  They're in our back end at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:39:07.298 --> 01:39:12.342]  Get your orders in now before the next big surge comes in.
[01:39:12.342 --> 01:39:17.166]  Believe me, every angle I've looked at tells me that really, really serious times are ahead.
[01:39:17.486 --> 01:39:25.431]  Whether Trump wins or loses, the globalists have already created a worldwide depression, lockdowns on a planetary scale, and it's only intensifying.
[01:39:25.431 --> 01:39:28.634]  This is one of the big boxes you've got to get checked off.
[01:39:28.634 --> 01:39:30.094]  It's high quality, affordable food.
[01:39:30.094 --> 01:39:37.359]  My Patriot has really good, high quality food at a very affordable price, and the packaging is the best you're going to find out there.
[01:39:37.359 --> 01:39:40.441]  Check it out for yourself at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:39:40.441 --> 01:39:46.806]  And then the money that comes in that's extra helps us fund the information warfare operation that fights the globalists toe to toe.
[01:39:49.829 --> 01:39:54.673]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[01:39:54.673 --> 01:40:03.583]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[01:40:03.583 --> 01:40:08.648]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[01:40:08.908 --> 01:40:20.477]  The new Platinum Standard of Advanced Multivitamin Formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects and give your body the tools it needs to support your body.
[01:40:20.477 --> 01:40:30.384]  Using a proprietary process, we've managed to make this powerhouse formula into a delicious, concentrated drink mix that's loaded with high-quality ingredients, perfect for a hot summer.
[01:40:30.384 --> 01:40:31.985]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:41:07.290 --> 01:41:08.691]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:08.691 --> 01:41:09.952]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:41:09.952 --> 01:41:13.095]  Roger Stone, exclusive worldwide interviews with us, five minutes to the next hour.
[01:41:13.095 --> 01:41:17.038]  Your brother, mainstream media, government cover-up.
[01:41:17.038 --> 01:41:17.899]  You want answers?
[01:41:17.899 --> 01:41:19.580]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:21.241]  Well, so does he.
[01:41:21.241 --> 01:41:26.406]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:41:26.406 --> 01:41:31.170]  Here's all the listeners supporting Roger Stone, because believe me, we're all sitting in the same tree together.
[01:41:32.543 --> 01:41:40.107]  And the attempt to brand the election as Russian, the populist movement as un-American, when the globalists are in bed with the chi-coms and don't want the country to exist.
[01:41:40.107 --> 01:41:42.529]  It's really ridiculous they're trying to do this.
[01:41:42.529 --> 01:41:43.950]  They're at war with logic.
[01:41:43.950 --> 01:41:46.851]  They're traitors, trying to overload the country.
[01:41:46.851 --> 01:41:52.114]  And so they've got to say the loyal patriots are the bad guys, but the truth is we're not, and we need to get that word out.
[01:41:52.114 --> 01:41:58.238]  So Roger's victory is all of our victories, and I want to ask him about all the wild calls, what the president said to him.
[01:41:58.238 --> 01:41:59.739]  He hasn't really elaborated on that yet.
[01:42:00.599 --> 01:42:02.541]  Uh, what all the other big guys in D.C.
[01:42:02.541 --> 01:42:06.826]  he knows, what the inside baseball is, about what's coming next, so much with Roger Stone.
[01:42:06.826 --> 01:42:18.938]  But Roger, finish up with the day after you accepted Jesus as your Lord and Savior, you're already a Christian but not, you know, backslidden obviously, and then really tried and really gave your heart to Christ again, recommitted, what happened?
[01:42:20.063 --> 01:42:31.311]  Well, this was on a Saturday that I was reborn, and that very Monday morning, a day later, all the stories about the corrupt jury hit the fan.
[01:42:31.311 --> 01:42:32.311]  None of which I knew.
[01:42:32.311 --> 01:42:34.493]  We had none of that information.
[01:42:34.493 --> 01:42:42.138]  Frankly, Mike Cernovich, a crusading independent journalist, a solid conservative, broke that story and it was everywhere.
[01:42:42.138 --> 01:42:48.242]  And from that moment on, I was highly confident that everything was going to be fine, that
[01:42:48.702 --> 01:42:56.791]  God was now going to take his hand and he would provide, that he would in the end protect me from those who would persecute me.
[01:42:56.791 --> 01:43:02.377]  So I escaped the snare and the fowler, as they say in Psalm 91.
[01:43:02.377 --> 01:43:09.125]  And now the hardest part about being a Christian, of course, is the old Roger Stone, you know, would want revenge.
[01:43:10.316 --> 01:43:11.057]  I'm Sicilian.
[01:43:11.057 --> 01:43:12.118]  I would want revenge.
[01:43:12.118 --> 01:43:14.781]  But I realize now that that's not my place.
[01:43:14.781 --> 01:43:17.043]  That vengeance belongs to God.
[01:43:17.043 --> 01:43:18.845]  That He will judge.
[01:43:18.845 --> 01:43:24.732]  And that He will subject those who deserve it to the vengeance that they deserve.
[01:43:25.379 --> 01:43:26.900]  Therefore, it's preserved for him.
[01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:40.951]  And the good thing about that is, I know that those who are evil, that those who tried to destroy me and are trying to destroy you right now, try to destroy General Mike Flynn, a great patriot, try to take down our great president, they will get their just desserts.
[01:43:40.951 --> 01:43:45.114]  But they will get it from God, a wrathful God, in this case.
[01:43:45.114 --> 01:43:50.899]  And it is a terrible thing to be subjected to the vengeance of the living God, as Hebrews 30, 31 tells us.
[01:43:53.951 --> 01:44:04.658]  So, Alex, I really do, as I now realize, I have a hard break at 2 o'clock my time, so I really do need to talk about my phone call with the President.
[01:44:04.658 --> 01:44:05.098]  Let's do that.
[01:44:05.098 --> 01:44:05.579]  Let's get into it now.
[01:44:05.579 --> 01:44:07.620]  Let's talk about how this came about.
[01:44:07.620 --> 01:44:19.168]  So, last Friday, around 5 o'clock, many media outlets, ABC was among the first, then Fox News, and then everybody, was saying that the President would commute my sentence.
[01:44:19.815 --> 01:44:22.280]  Prior to that, there was a lot of speculation.
[01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:25.927]  It could be a commutation, it could be a pardon, it could be nothing.
[01:44:25.927 --> 01:44:29.635]  These same reports had popped up the previous Sunday and nothing came of them.
[01:44:30.402 --> 01:44:35.385]  Uh, and, uh, so it became pretty clear that something was going to happen.
[01:44:35.385 --> 01:44:37.446]  Uh, people started just arriving at my home.
[01:44:37.446 --> 01:44:50.615]  I hadn't invited anybody, but patriots, uh, folks from the Trump Club, young Republicans, uh, local conservatives, uh, friends from the Republican Party, a lot of info warriors, people just started arriving.
[01:44:50.615 --> 01:44:57.319]  Uh, and then, um, because I'm under, I was under house arrest at that time, I could not leave the actual house.
[01:44:57.995 --> 01:45:02.539]  We sorted people out between those who were wearing masks, they were allowed to come in.
[01:45:02.539 --> 01:45:08.164]  Those who didn't have a mask, they could mask in the front yard inside a gate.
[01:45:08.164 --> 01:45:11.647]  Somebody sent out for beer and we had a pop-up party.
[01:45:11.647 --> 01:45:14.009]  And then around seven o'clock, my cell phone rang.
[01:45:15.170 --> 01:45:21.052]  And it was the White House switchboard operator saying, this is the White House switchboard.
[01:45:21.052 --> 01:45:24.313]  I have a call from the President of the United States.
[01:45:24.313 --> 01:45:25.793]  We'd like to speak to Roger Stone.
[01:45:25.793 --> 01:45:28.474]  And I said, this is Roger Stone.
[01:45:28.474 --> 01:45:32.455]  And he said, are you available for a call from the President?
[01:45:32.455 --> 01:45:34.215]  Whoever says no, by the way.
[01:45:34.215 --> 01:45:35.536]  I said, yes, I am.
[01:45:35.536 --> 01:45:36.796]  And he said, one minute, please.
[01:45:37.492 --> 01:45:53.368]  Two minutes later, the president came on and said, Raj, I said, yes, Mr. President, he said, I want to let you know that right now I have just signed a an act of clemency in which I have commuted your sentence because I believe you did not get a fair trial.
[01:45:53.368 --> 01:45:56.931]  And I think that this was an incredible injustice.
[01:45:56.931 --> 01:46:00.115]  I think the investigation into you was fraudulent.
[01:46:01.056 --> 01:46:06.560]  And I also understand that your life is in danger if you go to a COVID-infested prison.
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:09.923]  Actually, I think he said coronavirus-infested prison.
[01:46:09.923 --> 01:46:11.865]  And I said, that is correct, Mr. President.
[01:46:11.865 --> 01:46:12.846]  I thank you very much.
[01:46:12.846 --> 01:46:13.947]  I think you've saved my life.
[01:46:14.804 --> 01:46:17.786]  And he said, well, I want you to fight to exonerate your name.
[01:46:17.786 --> 01:46:23.709]  I think you got a good chance to get this overturned and to get exonerated.
[01:46:23.709 --> 01:46:24.590]  And I said, yes, sir.
[01:46:24.590 --> 01:46:27.872]  He said, that's the difference between a pardon and a commutation.
[01:46:27.872 --> 01:46:29.493]  You know, a pardon is final.
[01:46:29.493 --> 01:46:37.677]  But in this case, you're entitled to go pursue your appeal, which is why I'm still raising money at StoneDefenseFund.com.
[01:46:37.677 --> 01:46:40.439]  An appeal could cost, you know, a million dollars, could take a year.
[01:46:41.259 --> 01:46:42.820]  And I said, yes, sir, I understand.
[01:46:42.820 --> 01:46:43.940]  And he said, how's your wife?
[01:46:43.940 --> 01:46:45.841]  He said, actually, how's your beautiful wife?
[01:46:45.841 --> 01:46:47.201]  I said, she's great.
[01:46:47.201 --> 01:46:48.442]  I said, how's the first lady?
[01:46:48.442 --> 01:46:50.963]  He says she fully supports what I have done.
[01:46:50.963 --> 01:46:51.903]  She's one of your fans.
[01:46:51.903 --> 01:46:54.124]  And I said, thank you very much, Mr. President.
[01:46:54.124 --> 01:46:56.145]  And he said, God bless you.
[01:46:56.145 --> 01:46:57.485]  And now you're a free man.
[01:46:57.485 --> 01:46:58.765]  I said, thank you much.
[01:46:58.765 --> 01:47:00.086]  Thank you very much, Mr. President.
[01:47:00.086 --> 01:47:01.166]  I hung up.
[01:47:01.166 --> 01:47:03.507]  It was it was an amazing moment.
[01:47:03.507 --> 01:47:06.628]  It was like having a weight off of your shoulders.
[01:47:06.628 --> 01:47:08.509]  And this would never have been possible.
[01:47:09.170 --> 01:47:11.371]  Without the help of so many people.
[01:47:11.371 --> 01:47:16.753]  Let's start with Alex Jones, who had never abandoned me, stuck with me through the whole thing.
[01:47:16.753 --> 01:47:21.595]  Skeptical in the first that they would really come after me, but once they did, Alex, you were there.
[01:47:21.595 --> 01:47:23.635]  Tucker Carlson is the standout.
[01:47:23.635 --> 01:47:27.217]  Tucker Carlson was incensed by what they did with me.
[01:47:27.217 --> 01:47:31.738]  He has a deep sense of justice, and he was outraged he was so angry.
[01:47:31.738 --> 01:47:33.899]  Isn't he just an amazingly classy guy?
[01:47:33.899 --> 01:47:35.239]  I mean, I already knew him.
[01:47:35.239 --> 01:47:36.540]  He'd been to the office before we'd been to dinner.
[01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:39.322]  I got to know him and have dinners with him a few times with you.
[01:47:39.322 --> 01:47:41.404]  He is just super classy.
[01:47:41.404 --> 01:47:42.425]  He's a patriot.
[01:47:42.425 --> 01:47:51.053]  And look, I don't know this for certain, but my guess is he got pressure from the Fox corporate to stop talking about Roger Stone in this case, but he would never stop.
[01:47:51.053 --> 01:47:53.495]  He pounded it at every turn of the case.
[01:47:53.495 --> 01:47:56.358]  He took this judge on when she acted improperly.
[01:47:56.358 --> 01:47:59.641]  I mean, I don't, you could not have a better friend.
[01:47:59.641 --> 01:48:01.483]  You could not have a more loyal friend.
[01:48:02.023 --> 01:48:03.383]  Then Tucker Carlson.
[01:48:03.383 --> 01:48:04.204]  Sean Hannity.
[01:48:04.204 --> 01:48:05.464]  Sean and I were not close.
[01:48:05.464 --> 01:48:07.184]  Now we are good friends.
[01:48:07.184 --> 01:48:10.665]  He stepped right up to the plate and he covered my case.
[01:48:10.665 --> 01:48:13.346]  And I believe he spoke to people in touch with the president.
[01:48:13.346 --> 01:48:17.067]  He may have even spoke to the president, but he was there.
[01:48:17.067 --> 01:48:19.667]  Mark Levin and I have never been friends.
[01:48:19.667 --> 01:48:21.948]  We had some past scuffles.
[01:48:22.348 --> 01:48:25.452]  By the way, they were probably my fault, and I've apologized for them.
[01:48:25.452 --> 01:48:26.794]  But that's not the important thing.
[01:48:26.794 --> 01:48:29.076]  What was important here was the principle.
[01:48:29.076 --> 01:48:35.324]  And he did a great job of deconstructing the arguments against me and the misconduct.
[01:48:38.007 --> 01:48:45.538]  They're in the news saying on my show, they list it all over, and others, that you said, quote, I had a bunch of dirt, but I won't squeal on the President.
[01:48:45.538 --> 01:48:46.759]  You never said that.
[01:48:46.759 --> 01:48:51.646]  You said, I will never roll over and make stuff up they want me to, because there is no dirt.
[01:48:51.646 --> 01:48:53.469]  So I just want you to get that on record for the New York Times.
[01:48:54.554 --> 01:48:55.875]  That is absolutely true.
[01:48:55.875 --> 01:49:01.398]  There was no misconduct by the President or any other illegal activity that I was aware of.
[01:49:01.398 --> 01:49:04.260]  What I said was, I would not lie about the President.
[01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:06.661]  Now, I've got to finish my list because it's important.
[01:49:06.661 --> 01:49:07.682]  Keep going.
[01:49:07.682 --> 01:49:15.427]  I've got to thank Kristen Davis, who had the guts, my friend who had the guts to go on CNN and MSNBC and defend me throughout this whole thing.
[01:49:15.427 --> 01:49:16.888]  Did an amazing job.
[01:49:16.888 --> 01:49:18.428]  Went right into the lion's den.
[01:49:18.428 --> 01:49:19.129]  Beat them back.
[01:49:19.589 --> 01:49:27.871]  I've got to thank Congressman Matt Gaetz, who was a great supporter, who never let up in his advocacy on my behalf.
[01:49:27.871 --> 01:49:36.533]  I've got to thank Larry Kudlow, a man who worked closely with the President on the modern economic miracle, which is the Trump comeback.
[01:49:36.533 --> 01:49:41.915]  I've got to thank my friend Michael Caputo, who I've been prohibited from speaking to for almost two years.
[01:49:42.835 --> 01:49:46.078]  But I know he was in my corner.
[01:49:46.078 --> 01:49:47.279]  You never know where to stop.
[01:49:47.279 --> 01:49:57.607]  Reverend Daryl Scott, Pastor Mark Burns, Reverend Randy Coggins, so many Christians, Franklin Graham, all of these people, General Mike Flynn, in my corner.
[01:49:58.587 --> 01:50:03.029]  God bless every one of you because every one of you contributed to make this happen.
[01:50:03.029 --> 01:50:05.470]  It's impossible to name everybody.
[01:50:05.470 --> 01:50:06.170]  It really is.
[01:50:06.170 --> 01:50:07.211]  I'd like to.
[01:50:07.211 --> 01:50:09.852]  So many great Americans in my corner.
[01:50:09.852 --> 01:50:13.673]  So Alex... And by the way, if we let them get you, they're going to get everybody.
[01:50:13.673 --> 01:50:19.495]  They said the blueprint is to get all Trump supporters to quote, wipe us out.
[01:50:19.495 --> 01:50:21.916]  Look, we're up for the fight of our life.
[01:50:21.916 --> 01:50:25.858]  And this is an important outpost of the truth.
[01:50:26.821 --> 01:50:31.124]  Infowars is really still what it always was, a leader.
[01:50:31.124 --> 01:50:32.945]  And we won't be censored.
[01:50:32.945 --> 01:50:34.245]  We won't be silenced.
[01:50:34.245 --> 01:50:38.047]  We will never stop fighting for freedom and for liberty.
[01:50:38.047 --> 01:50:40.069]  So I am honored to be back with you.
[01:50:40.069 --> 01:50:41.930]  It's like being back home again.
[01:50:41.930 --> 01:50:47.693]  You can bet that I'll be back again because, you know, I understand they're trying to silence us.
[01:50:47.693 --> 01:50:51.555]  They're trying to kill our audience in terms of our reach.
[01:50:51.555 --> 01:50:53.156]  But I feel right at home here.
[01:50:53.816 --> 01:50:58.417]  And, uh, it's just good to be back and be able to tell the truth to the American people.
[01:50:58.417 --> 01:51:00.878]  And, Robert, don't forget, you already thanked her, but your wife.
[01:51:00.878 --> 01:51:01.498]  You've got 30 seconds.
[01:51:01.498 --> 01:51:03.559]  Your wife gets the most to thank for staying with you.
[01:51:03.559 --> 01:51:04.899]  My great wife and my daughter.
[01:51:04.899 --> 01:51:08.220]  My wife, Nydia, my daughter, Audrey, and my son, Scott.
[01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:12.401]  They stuck with me through thick and thin, particularly when I was having temper tantrums.
[01:51:12.401 --> 01:51:13.281]  They are the best.
[01:51:13.281 --> 01:51:14.701]  Alex, God bless you.
[01:51:14.701 --> 01:51:16.462]  God bless the Infowars audience.
[01:51:16.462 --> 01:51:17.422]  God bless everyone.
[01:51:18.042 --> 01:51:19.823]  The Lord has saved my life.
[01:51:19.823 --> 01:51:22.184]  This is indeed a glorious day.
[01:51:22.184 --> 01:51:25.145]  All right, now you're back in the game to get Trump re-elected with 111 days.
[01:51:25.145 --> 01:51:25.945]  God bless you, Roger.
[01:51:25.945 --> 01:51:28.366]  Thank you so much.
[01:51:28.366 --> 01:51:32.287]  We're gonna destroy what's happening with the whole COVID takeover and so much more with a special guest.
[01:51:32.287 --> 01:51:34.708]  Hour number three, only two minutes away.
[01:51:39.184 --> 01:51:46.307]  So I was taking care of an errand this morning, and I wasn't even close to downtown, but I was parked on a little side street going to this business.
[01:51:46.307 --> 01:51:55.252]  When I came back out, I saw what looked like two Asian folks, probably Chinese, walking down the sidewalk about 50 yards up ahead of me.
[01:51:55.252 --> 01:52:00.014]  And here I am parked a truck with the windows up, and the woman stops and points at me.
[01:52:00.014 --> 01:52:03.275]  So they stop, and they wait while I'm inside my truck.
[01:52:03.275 --> 01:52:05.536]  Truck started, and they sit there and stretch.
[01:52:05.536 --> 01:52:06.337]  She keeps pointing.
[01:52:06.997 --> 01:52:09.013]  And they put their hands out like they're waiting for me.
[01:52:10.322 --> 01:52:14.765]  To go, because I'm not wearing a mask inside my car.
[01:52:14.765 --> 01:52:18.727]  And so then I just sat there, so they acted angry and walked past me.
[01:52:18.727 --> 01:52:24.070]  I almost shot a video of it on my phone, but everybody sees this stuff happening everywhere.
[01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:25.031]  This is mental illness.
[01:52:25.031 --> 01:52:28.613]  People are pulling guns on folks that aren't wearing masks.
[01:52:28.613 --> 01:52:30.054]  This is all cult programming.
[01:52:30.054 --> 01:52:31.615]  This is all about submitting.
[01:52:31.615 --> 01:52:34.457]  We cannot submit to this UN brainwashing.
[01:52:34.457 --> 01:52:35.857]  It's all a giant fraud.
[01:52:35.857 --> 01:52:38.159]  We must expose the fraud or become slaves to it.
[01:52:40.077 --> 01:52:50.905]  Americans have had freedom for so long, and most Americans were born into such docile times compared to the rest of history, that we really have a blind spot for tyranny.
[01:52:50.905 --> 01:53:00.112]  We don't appreciate the American way, truth, justice, due process, the right to self-defense, private property, because we've had it so long, and we just think that's how the rest of the world is.
[01:53:00.472 --> 01:53:14.659]  Ladies and gentlemen, the renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and try to empower the weak as well as the strong is something the West invented and that's what made our modern world.
[01:53:14.659 --> 01:53:28.846]  That's now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth and we need to be culled and dumbed down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate, manipulate and command if we're even lucky enough to stay alive.
[01:53:29.306 --> 01:53:30.988]  And that's what COVID-19 is.
[01:53:30.988 --> 01:53:37.674]  A global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family, against prosperity, and against your future.
[01:53:37.674 --> 01:53:43.280]  If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:45.903]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:03.001 --> 01:54:05.762]  I have to ask you about Roger Stone.
[01:54:05.762 --> 01:54:07.783]  Help me understand.
[01:54:07.783 --> 01:54:15.626]  A, why do presidents or should presidents have the power to pardon anybody, especially someone who's related to them in a case?
[01:54:15.626 --> 01:54:28.312]  And secondly, what precedent could Trump be setting for America slash do you think it's going to be a precedent where a president says, I will pardon anybody who protects me by not snitching?
[01:54:29.093 --> 01:54:32.735]  Well, I think you just summed up why Roger Stone was pardoned.
[01:54:32.735 --> 01:54:36.476]  I mean, he basically threatened Trump.
[01:54:36.476 --> 01:54:40.958]  You know, he basically said, I sure don't want to go to jail and I sure have a lot more to say.
[01:54:40.958 --> 01:54:45.000]  And boy, I just wish there'd be somebody who could stop me from having to go to jail.
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:46.320]  And guess what?
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:48.201]  You know, Trump intervened.
[01:54:48.201 --> 01:54:54.044]  This is an extension of the total disregard for the rule of law, the pardon power,
[01:54:54.824 --> 01:55:09.427]  It's supposed to be used for compassionate purposes, to try to right wrongs, to try to make sure that people are not being punished unfairly or have been punished enough.
[01:55:09.427 --> 01:55:22.850]  And in this case, it's a continuation of the cover up because the one thing that's wrong... Ladies and gentlemen, Roger Stone was on my show almost every day and co-hosting the War Room during that entire time he was here.
[01:55:24.161 --> 01:55:32.346]  For a good year and a half before the election, I knew every major move Roger was making.
[01:55:32.346 --> 01:55:43.392]  And it was just good old-fashioned campaigning, exposing the Clintons' war on women, exposing their war on black people, pushing Trump to do the whole decriminalization, let blacks out of jail move.
[01:55:43.392 --> 01:55:44.493]  I mean, that's Roger Stone.
[01:55:44.493 --> 01:55:45.494]  That's not Jared Kushner.
[01:55:45.494 --> 01:55:49.836]  You can disagree with part of those policies or not, marijuana legalization, all that.
[01:55:49.836 --> 01:55:50.416]  That's Roger.
[01:55:50.416 --> 01:55:51.157]  He's really a liberal.
[01:55:52.210 --> 01:56:02.296]  A nationalist and a conservative, but we were there mad at Julian Assange when he was doing New York Times, Washington Post interviews every week, not giving us an interview.
[01:56:02.296 --> 01:56:06.438]  I told Roger, I said, I'll hire you if you can get Julian Assange on.
[01:56:06.438 --> 01:56:10.341]  He was trying, he was getting talked to the hand.
[01:56:10.341 --> 01:56:15.464]  It's cool to be the underdog in full wars, but I mean, you know, we get treated like crap by a lot of people that don't get it.
[01:56:16.491 --> 01:56:22.075]  So, the idea that he was a Russian spy, I was just telling Roger, quit talking about it, it's stupid.
[01:56:22.075 --> 01:56:22.855]  That's ridiculous.
[01:56:22.855 --> 01:56:29.360]  Then they started saying it about me in Congress, like, oh, he's a Russian agent, in armed services committee meetings.
[01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:39.066]  And just the most crazy stuff, and then things I can't get into at this point, because there's, you know, investigations of the people that did it and the rest of it, but it's been wild, folks.
[01:56:39.066 --> 01:56:45.951]  When you've done nothing they're accusing you of, none of it, not one percent is true, they're still coming after you.
[01:56:47.165 --> 01:56:51.431]  Folks, I was going to launch a whole string of new items.
[01:56:51.431 --> 01:56:52.953]  I guess it's eight items total.
[01:56:52.953 --> 01:56:59.982]  Mouthwash and also an activated charcoal toothpaste that my dad, who's a retired dentist, developed.
[01:56:59.982 --> 01:57:00.903]  It has no fillers.
[01:57:00.903 --> 01:57:02.385]  It's super high-end.
[01:57:02.385 --> 01:57:03.566]  It's incredible toothpaste.
[01:57:04.167 --> 01:57:17.979]  And it's not to compete with our tooth whitening toothpaste and our coiled silver toothpaste that we've discontinued until Leticia James stops lying and saying that we have some type of cure for something.
[01:57:17.979 --> 01:57:20.201]  It's absolutely asinine.
[01:57:20.201 --> 01:57:21.883]  It's not true at all.
[01:57:21.883 --> 01:57:23.324]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:57:23.324 --> 01:57:28.109]  Now, we've got the new toothpaste in for a few weeks, but I've got one more big test
[01:57:29.235 --> 01:57:33.236]  That we are supposed to do on it until we're able to sell it.
[01:57:33.236 --> 01:57:41.819]  So I thought that this week would be the week that we would be able to sell all of this and do all of this, but we're not able.
[01:57:41.819 --> 01:57:43.720]  So the original sale that I had running
[01:57:44.480 --> 01:57:47.141]  It's just going to keep running until next week.
[01:57:47.141 --> 01:57:49.823]  Storewide free shipping, double Patriot points, but it's even bigger.
[01:57:49.823 --> 01:57:50.823]  We had this sale last year.
[01:57:50.823 --> 01:57:55.725]  I wasn't going to do it at this time because we're about to sell a lot of things, but we're launching it right now.
[01:57:55.725 --> 01:58:00.467]  Christmas in July sale, free shipping and double Patriot points, 50 to 60% off.
[01:58:03.929 --> 01:58:06.670]  And we've got brain force plus 50% off.
[01:58:06.670 --> 01:58:07.470]  These are things we're adding.

[01:58:36.782 --> 01:58:38.724]  AM-PM PowerStack, 50% off.
[01:58:38.724 --> 01:58:41.107]  And it goes on and on, store-bought and free shipping.
[01:58:41.107 --> 01:58:41.987]  Double Patriot points.
[01:58:41.987 --> 01:58:44.410]  Our special guest joins us when we come right back on the other side.
[01:58:47.870 --> 01:59:04.514]  Whether you believe in evolution in the modern theory or not, the globalist controllers do, and they constantly write about and talk about how they want to create a global crisis or a group of crises that force humans to, quote, evolve in a new, better way.
[01:59:04.514 --> 01:59:07.655]  Now, when you study how they actually want you to evolve, if you believe in that,
[01:59:08.175 --> 01:59:12.378]  It is to stop having children emerge with silicon bodies and a post-human future.
[01:59:12.378 --> 01:59:13.819]  Talk about psychotic.
[01:59:13.819 --> 01:59:15.100]  Talk about creepy.
[01:59:15.100 --> 01:59:16.040]  Talk about crazy.
[01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:33.051]  But they need an event like COVID-19 to teach a mammal to wear some covering over its nose, over its breathing tubes, to set the precedent for the forced inoculations, for the GMO, for the 5G, and for all the things that they admit will end our humanity as we know it.
[01:59:33.371 --> 01:59:34.792]  That's why this is so evil.
[01:59:34.792 --> 01:59:43.618]  Their whole agenda for a cashless society, global government, UN control, getting us all into debt, getting rid of local government.
[01:59:43.618 --> 01:59:45.039]  Think about all the facets of it.
[01:59:45.039 --> 01:59:46.961]  The censorship, the surveillance.
[02:00:08.524 --> 02:00:33.130]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide on this Tuesday edition.
[02:00:33.130 --> 02:00:37.111]  And everybody knows Tim Hoft of Gateway Pundit and the great job he does.
[02:00:38.305 --> 02:00:40.607]  But his brother is an executive.
[02:00:40.607 --> 02:00:41.768]  He's lived in Asia.
[02:00:41.768 --> 02:00:43.329]  He was recently living in Hong Kong.
[02:00:43.329 --> 02:00:45.410]  He's moved back to the United States with his family.
[02:00:45.410 --> 02:01:00.662]  Joe Hoffman, he's done a great job writing articles at the Gateway Pundit, laying out really the fraud that is COVID, the overblown hoax, all the different facets of them, counting other people that died of gunshot wounds and car wrecks in the COVID column and the false positive test.
[02:01:00.662 --> 02:01:02.263]  But the big smoking gun for me
[02:01:03.621 --> 02:01:05.101]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:01:05.101 --> 02:01:08.642]  COVID testing scandal, numerous labs, 333.
[02:01:08.642 --> 02:01:15.504]  Report 100% of people testing positive for coronavirus in Florida.
[02:01:15.504 --> 02:01:16.444]  That is impossible.
[02:01:16.444 --> 02:01:20.045]  And again, I told the story of my wife's personal trainer.
[02:01:20.045 --> 02:01:21.005]  She's a friend of mine.
[02:01:21.005 --> 02:01:23.246]  She goes on the boat with us and goes hiking with us.
[02:01:23.246 --> 02:01:26.807]  She has two older ladies she's a trainer for.
[02:01:26.807 --> 02:01:31.608]  And they went in a few weeks ago to get tested because they had a sore throat and sniffles.
[02:01:32.878 --> 02:01:33.759]  Didn't have a fever.
[02:01:33.759 --> 02:01:34.441]  They stood in line.
[02:01:34.441 --> 02:01:35.442]  They said, just fill out these forms.
[02:01:35.442 --> 02:01:38.507]  They said, you don't need to go do the test now.
[02:01:38.507 --> 02:01:39.008]  You can go.
[02:01:39.008 --> 02:01:39.769]  They sent them emails.
[02:01:41.002 --> 02:01:44.083]  And I got on the phone and got the lady's number and called one of them.
[02:01:44.083 --> 02:01:46.223]  She's scared to come on, but she said, yeah, no.
[02:01:46.223 --> 02:01:48.944]  We got told we both had COVID-19, but no treatment needed.
[02:01:48.944 --> 02:01:50.664]  This is premeditated fraud.
[02:01:50.664 --> 02:01:55.386]  It's being directed by the NIH from the UN, and it's just unbelievable.
[02:01:55.386 --> 02:01:58.827]  And then you add California locking down again, Texas getting ready to.
[02:01:58.827 --> 02:02:01.307]  I'm told Austin today or tomorrow is about to do it.
[02:02:01.307 --> 02:02:02.948]  They admit they want to create a depression.
[02:02:02.948 --> 02:02:03.968]  It's just insane.
[02:02:04.528 --> 02:02:07.470]  So joining us is Joe Hoft of TheGatewayPundit.com.
[02:02:07.470 --> 02:02:08.591]  Joe, thanks for joining us.
[02:02:08.591 --> 02:02:12.314]  You're an expert on this, living in it, seeing it, writing about it.
[02:02:12.314 --> 02:02:15.536]  What would you describe the root of this is and who's directing it?
[02:02:15.536 --> 02:02:25.744]  Because it is a directed fraud and they're trying to get a national emergency declared so that the central government can direct the fraud to the other 30-something states that aren't going along with it.
[02:02:25.744 --> 02:02:30.267]  I mean, this is the biggest institutional organized fraud I've ever even imagined.
[02:02:30.267 --> 02:02:30.988]  What would you call this?
[02:02:33.198 --> 02:02:36.520]  Um, I guess another part of the rolling coup.
[02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:38.421]  The rolling coup.
[02:02:38.421 --> 02:02:38.781]  That's it.
[02:02:38.781 --> 02:02:41.822]  COVID-19, part of the rolling coup.
[02:02:41.822 --> 02:02:42.523]  Isn't that something?
[02:02:42.523 --> 02:02:51.887]  I heard somebody else share that recently on another interview, and I thought that explains best what's going on in this, you know, in these last three and a half, four years.
[02:02:51.887 --> 02:03:01.052]  We've jumped from Mueller to impeachment to COVID, and the military's jumped in now recently opposing Trump.
[02:03:01.508 --> 02:03:08.752]  And it's just part of a rolling coup d'etat that they've attempted to remove this president from office.
[02:03:08.752 --> 02:03:21.800]  Now, as far as the COVID itself, you know, we've got more and more evidence now that it certainly came out of China and it's attached to that lab in Wuhan, the Institute of Virology.
[02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:24.722]  I've been to Wuhan a number of times.
[02:03:24.722 --> 02:03:26.683]  I know that city.
[02:03:26.683 --> 02:03:27.804]  It's a massive city.
[02:03:28.519 --> 02:03:38.401]  And this lab was just only minutes away from the market that the Chinese were attempting to tie the virus to.
[02:03:38.401 --> 02:03:41.902]  So, yeah, I think there's a number of parties involved, Alex.
[02:03:41.902 --> 02:03:43.282]  I think China's involved.
[02:03:43.282 --> 02:03:47.963]  I think the individuals in the U.S.
[02:03:47.963 --> 02:03:54.544]  Big Pharma is a suggested group of companies that are involved.
[02:03:54.544 --> 02:03:56.685]  There's a lot of money involved in this already.
[02:03:57.838 --> 02:04:05.326]  Billions being either allocated or spent, so a lot of players involved, for sure.
[02:04:05.326 --> 02:04:15.597]  Well, let's back away from this and look at it, because Bill Gates said five months ago, the lockdown will never end, we're going to keep it in place, you'll have to have the inoculation before you get it.
[02:04:16.348 --> 02:04:18.850]  And so, of course, here we are following that script.
[02:04:18.850 --> 02:04:22.312]  Obviously, he set up the John Hopkins event 201.
[02:04:22.312 --> 02:04:24.253]  The Rockefellers have the lockstep.
[02:04:24.253 --> 02:04:25.314]  This is all codified.
[02:04:25.314 --> 02:04:26.475]  How do we defeat the fraud?
[02:04:26.475 --> 02:04:34.300]  Don't we show how it's premeditated and how Fauci owns part of the vaccine companies and how it's insider trading and conflicts of interest?
[02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:41.045]  I mean, I think Trump, instead of just showing how Fauci was wrong all these times and sidelining him, we have the Washington Post saying Trump's not allowed to fire him.
[02:04:41.045 --> 02:04:42.306]  That, of course, is ridiculous.
[02:04:42.306 --> 02:04:44.247]  He can remove the head of the department if they don't fire him.
[02:04:46.068 --> 02:04:50.390]  How does Trump and how do the American people go on the offense?
[02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:51.491]  That's a good question, Alex.
[02:04:51.491 --> 02:05:00.796]  I guess we need to continue to do what we're doing here and at the Gateway Pundit, and that's just continue to share the truth, do all we can to get the word out.
[02:05:00.796 --> 02:05:02.156]  And I think we are being heard.
[02:05:03.986 --> 02:05:05.046]  I think we are being heard.
[02:05:05.046 --> 02:05:11.348]  And there's a lot of people that are very frustrated about this situation, not just in the U.S., but around the world.
[02:05:11.348 --> 02:05:17.689]  And a lot of people have been frightened, you know, due to this coronavirus as well.
[02:05:17.689 --> 02:05:20.890]  So we've come up with some evidence early on.
[02:05:20.890 --> 02:05:24.210]  And maybe you recall last time I was on your show was back in March.
[02:05:24.210 --> 02:05:26.431]  It was, I believe it was March 17th.
[02:05:26.431 --> 02:05:32.172]  And we had just come out with some analysis that I had done for Jim.
[02:05:32.742 --> 02:05:51.498]  Where we looked at the WHO, the World Health Organization, and their analysis and prediction for the deaths related to the coronavirus, and they scared basically the hell out of everybody because they were saying the flu has a .06% rate of mortality of those that
[02:05:58.422 --> 02:06:04.465]  And it turns out that is an admitted complete giant fraud and medical doctors say the numbers are lower than the flu.
[02:06:04.465 --> 02:06:05.485]  Can you speak to that?
[02:06:05.485 --> 02:06:10.508]  Because they said 2.5 million dead, 2.2 million dead in the U.S., 500,000 dead in the U.K., all massively exaggerated 20 plus times.
[02:06:25.822 --> 02:06:30.324]  And so that, I think, was a big part of this coup.
[02:06:30.324 --> 02:06:32.605]  It was, let's scare everybody and let's shut down the economy.
[02:06:32.605 --> 02:06:34.966]  And that's certainly what they wanted to do.
[02:06:34.966 --> 02:06:38.227]  And once they panicked us into submitting, boom, the trap is shut.
[02:06:38.227 --> 02:06:39.607]  Now it doesn't matter if it was all fraud.
[02:06:39.607 --> 02:06:40.988]  They've got us.
[02:06:40.988 --> 02:06:41.708]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:06:41.708 --> 02:06:43.889]  And now a lot of people don't want to admit that they were wrong.
[02:06:43.889 --> 02:06:46.350]  They don't want to admit they're fools.
[02:06:46.350 --> 02:06:48.911]  And they go along with this insanity.
[02:06:48.911 --> 02:06:51.332]  And the rest of us sit back and say, this is crazy.
[02:06:52.716 --> 02:07:03.044]  We flew back from Hong Kong a few weeks ago, back to the States, and we arrived at the airport, and they tell us, oh, you can't fly through Japan.
[02:07:03.044 --> 02:07:05.226]  Their airport's shut down at night.
[02:07:05.226 --> 02:07:12.171]  So we had to quickly rearrange our flights, and 12 hours later, we were able to fly through San Francisco.
[02:07:12.171 --> 02:07:19.297]  But we saw one of the world's most efficient and busy airports in the world, the Hong Kong
[02:07:20.287 --> 02:07:22.129]  We were there was only one lounge open.
[02:07:22.129 --> 02:07:22.710]  We were there.
[02:07:22.710 --> 02:07:28.296]  We were the only three people in that lounge for hours that day on a Sunday afternoon.
[02:07:28.296 --> 02:07:31.620]  So in effect, Hong Kong airport was shut down.
[02:07:31.620 --> 02:07:33.762]  Japan's airport shut down.
[02:07:33.762 --> 02:07:38.287]  And then we get to San Francisco and that airport shut down three massive airports.
[02:07:38.797 --> 02:07:39.158]  I don't know.
[02:07:58.171 --> 02:08:04.754]  When somebody's in Stockholm Syndrome, serving their abusers like the general public, how do you get them out?
[02:08:04.754 --> 02:08:10.617]  Because yeah, I've had family that's been conned and stuff, and they'll get mad at me telling somebody's a con artist.
[02:08:10.617 --> 02:08:15.960]  And even once it comes out that I was right, the family will never talk to you again for warning them!
[02:08:16.963 --> 02:08:18.183]  Yeah, you're right, Alex.
[02:08:18.183 --> 02:08:20.884]  It's just, well, it's insanity.
[02:08:20.884 --> 02:08:28.365]  Like you said, group think, and there is this element of ego that people have that they don't want to admit that they're wrong.
[02:08:28.365 --> 02:08:29.405]  So we were spot on.
[02:08:29.405 --> 02:08:32.586]  We knew that that WHO prediction was way off.
[02:08:32.586 --> 02:08:36.526]  We reported it, and actually then the next day we were attacked.
[02:08:36.526 --> 02:08:39.147]  We were attacked by Media Matters.
[02:08:39.147 --> 02:08:46.248]  They did a hit piece on us, both on you and the Gateway Pundit, because Jim was on that call as well.
[02:08:46.775 --> 02:08:46.935]  Yeah.
[02:08:54.660 --> 02:09:00.724]  Actually, as we start looking at numbers today, even today I'm getting some new numbers.
[02:09:00.724 --> 02:09:18.795]  One of the best measurements I've seen is an individual, a PhD, who sent us some data and he just sent me some updated data, we'll be putting it up later today, that shows probably the best analysis is not just to look for the number of cases of COVID because we know that the CDC
[02:09:19.395 --> 02:09:24.720]  And other entities are distorting the data.
[02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:26.001]  It's not accurate.
[02:09:26.001 --> 02:09:28.183]  They claim everything is a COVID death.
[02:09:28.183 --> 02:09:35.809]  Joe Hoff, let's walk through that in the articles you've written for Gateway Pundit to detail it all on the other side, because this is so important.
[02:09:35.809 --> 02:09:37.591]  This guy was right about the previous fraud debt on.
[02:09:37.591 --> 02:09:38.211]  His brother was.
[02:09:38.211 --> 02:09:39.953]  I mean, even more debt on than we were.
[02:09:39.953 --> 02:09:41.694]  They were even ahead of us on this.
[02:09:41.694 --> 02:09:42.495]  That's rare.
[02:09:42.495 --> 02:09:44.937]  And then now they're going to tell you what's currently happening and what's coming next.
[02:09:45.177 --> 02:09:48.822]  Ultra 12 is already our overall number one bestseller.
[02:09:48.822 --> 02:09:54.709]  Ultra 12 is twice as strong as Secret 12 for an even lower price.
[02:09:54.709 --> 02:09:59.375]  Because I signed a huge multi-year contract to guarantee to buy a ton of it.
[02:09:59.375 --> 02:10:02.218]  And my bet ended up to be successful so far.
[02:10:02.779 --> 02:10:04.860]  Folks are ordering it in mass.
[02:10:04.860 --> 02:10:06.441]  They're getting great responses.
[02:10:06.441 --> 02:10:13.726]  They're giving us incredible reviews because we know what vitamin B12 of this type does, taken under the tongue, where it's more absorbable.
[02:10:13.726 --> 02:10:24.912]  It supports healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, help the body produce more energy, help produce healthy blood cells, essential for proper nervous system function, and so much more.
[02:10:24.912 --> 02:10:32.517]  You can take all the energy drinks and they won't do anything if you don't have the basics already in your body, like vitamin B12, whether you're
[02:10:32.657 --> 02:10:35.838]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[02:10:55.376 --> 02:11:00.097]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[02:11:00.097 --> 02:11:02.457]  Super Male Vitality!
[02:11:02.457 --> 02:11:11.299]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[02:11:11.299 --> 02:11:22.201]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[02:11:22.461 --> 02:11:23.141]  Yes.
[02:11:23.141 --> 02:11:28.044]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[02:11:28.044 --> 02:11:34.968]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[02:11:34.968 --> 02:11:36.029]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:11:36.029 --> 02:11:37.890]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[02:11:37.890 --> 02:11:40.712]  Never been a better time than right now.
[02:11:40.712 --> 02:11:48.176]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:11:48.176 --> 02:11:50.838]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:12:00.663 --> 02:12:01.783]  I had to ask Joe Hoft.
[02:12:01.783 --> 02:12:02.664]  And I did.
[02:12:02.664 --> 02:12:06.545]  You don't have to wait until you die to learn the truth about COVID-19.
[02:12:06.545 --> 02:12:07.826]  Till the day you die.
[02:12:07.826 --> 02:12:09.186]  Give your reading.
[02:12:09.186 --> 02:12:11.327]  The New York Times, Washington Post.
[02:12:32.616 --> 02:12:33.237]  Watching CNN.
[02:12:33.237 --> 02:12:36.360]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:39.644]  Joe Hoffs is an executive, researcher, author, writes for Gateway Pundit.
[02:12:39.644 --> 02:12:42.888]  His twin brother, of course, runs it, thegatewaypundit.com.
[02:12:42.888 --> 02:12:46.512]  A lot of inside baseball, but he's been persecuted for his visit here.
[02:12:47.346 --> 02:12:58.339]  We've got all these other medical doctors, I'll play a clip of one coming up, who's in the State Senate of Minnesota, saying this is way overblown, here's the numbers, and they're trying to take his license for saying 2 plus 2 equals 4!
[02:12:58.339 --> 02:12:59.540]  So, let's roll through it.
[02:12:59.540 --> 02:13:02.264]  What has occurred since your last visit with us?
[02:13:02.264 --> 02:13:07.470]  The real numbers on COVID-19, what's currently happening, and what you expect for them to do next, because you hear everywhere,
[02:13:08.803 --> 02:13:20.934]  The tests are everywhere, and the numbers are skyrocketing, and then you learn almost all the tests are false, and 333 labs, as I said earlier, in Florida, all reported publicly 100% rates.
[02:13:20.934 --> 02:13:22.916]  Some of them testing thousands, the average about 500.
[02:13:22.916 --> 02:13:27.940]  So they're testing tens of thousands of people, and they're all positive.
[02:13:27.940 --> 02:13:30.182]  That is ridiculous!
[02:13:30.182 --> 02:13:31.083]  What's really going on here?
[02:13:33.073 --> 02:13:35.476]  That's a great question, Alex.
[02:13:35.476 --> 02:13:36.057]  It's funny.
[02:13:36.057 --> 02:13:43.887]  Over the weekend, my daughter was visiting, an older daughter, an adult daughter, and I said to her, I don't even know anymore.
[02:13:43.887 --> 02:13:46.130]  We're being lied to so much.
[02:13:46.130 --> 02:13:48.393]  Who even knows if these tests even work?
[02:13:48.999 --> 02:13:51.821]  I mean, who really even knows anymore?
[02:13:51.821 --> 02:14:00.929]  And so... Well, you're not going to have 333 labs all say 100% when they're testing hundreds and hundreds of people.
[02:14:00.929 --> 02:14:01.509]  That's right.
[02:14:01.509 --> 02:14:03.911]  Statistically, it's just not possible.
[02:14:03.911 --> 02:14:06.433]  So we found a number of things over the last few months.
[02:14:06.433 --> 02:14:08.635]  Gosh, it's been since March since we last talked.
[02:14:08.635 --> 02:14:15.341]  But, you know, even back then in March, we knew the WHO was lying about their prediction.
[02:14:15.341 --> 02:14:16.982]  It just didn't add up.
[02:14:16.982 --> 02:14:17.943]  It didn't make sense.
[02:14:18.542 --> 02:14:20.303]  And we did a number of posts on that.
[02:14:20.303 --> 02:14:32.292]  One thing that we did find, though, about the WHO that's not commonly known is that Todd Ross, that individual who runs the WHO, is a member of a terrorist group that runs Ethiopia.
[02:14:32.292 --> 02:14:34.354]  He's like number four in charge.
[02:14:34.354 --> 02:14:38.217]  He's covered up major cholera outbreaks, as he's written.
[02:14:38.217 --> 02:14:38.917]  There you go.
[02:14:38.917 --> 02:14:43.781]  And he also was involved in some terrorist actions there in that country as well.
[02:14:44.548 --> 02:14:44.868]  I don't know.
[02:15:05.822 --> 02:15:06.722]  They're the two countries.
[02:15:06.722 --> 02:15:10.164]  So that's why Ted Ross would do everything China said.
[02:15:10.164 --> 02:15:13.666]  It's because China's been backing his regime.
[02:15:13.666 --> 02:15:14.386]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:15:14.386 --> 02:15:16.868]  So Trump did the right thing pulling out of the WHO.
[02:15:16.868 --> 02:15:17.648]  Absolutely.
[02:15:17.648 --> 02:15:18.188]  Absolutely.
[02:15:18.188 --> 02:15:19.909]  So that was great.
[02:15:19.909 --> 02:15:26.653]  Along with that, we've learned a lot, too, as well, about Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx.
[02:15:26.653 --> 02:15:28.354]  Fauci has a long record.
[02:15:28.354 --> 02:15:31.476]  That guy sounds very, very corrupt when you look into it.
[02:15:31.816 --> 02:15:42.739]  I think one of the best individuals to discuss Fauci and just the vaccines in general, if not you Alex, is the Bobby Kennedy Jr.
[02:15:42.739 --> 02:15:42.979]  Oh yeah.
[02:15:42.979 --> 02:15:44.680]  I have a video of him.
[02:15:44.680 --> 02:15:47.200]  Well, he exposed his fraud, Steve, with the Gates.
[02:15:47.200 --> 02:15:50.401]  People that they've had in the test, they're even spokespersons, are getting real sick.
[02:15:50.401 --> 02:15:53.502]  Healthy people are getting real sick in the vaccine trials.
[02:15:53.502 --> 02:16:01.004]  Yeah, and that blew me away, you know, when I learned that and when I saw his, or listened in on one of his discussions.
[02:16:01.405 --> 02:16:04.148]  And you know, I grew up maybe like you, Alex.
[02:16:04.148 --> 02:16:05.469]  I grew up thinking, you know, the U.S.
[02:16:05.469 --> 02:16:08.892]  was this great country and Bobby Kennedy was a hero.
[02:16:08.892 --> 02:16:13.456]  And even though my mom was Republican, she liked Bobby Kennedy.
[02:16:13.456 --> 02:16:17.079]  And when he died, it was a sad day for the entire country when he was assassinated.
[02:16:17.079 --> 02:16:18.680]  Absolutely.
[02:16:18.680 --> 02:16:23.745]  But to see his son stand up and then the rest of the family criticizes the son for
[02:16:24.164 --> 02:16:25.065]  He's a bureaucratic royalty.
[02:16:25.065 --> 02:16:25.506]  He's an emperor.
[02:16:45.988 --> 02:16:50.109]  Yep, and he's been with everybody and he's made a lot of money along the way too, no doubt.
[02:16:50.109 --> 02:16:55.591]  I'd love to see somebody ask him some questions about what's your annual salary and what's your net worth.
[02:16:55.591 --> 02:17:00.773]  He got a $111 million grant last year from Bill & Melinda Gates in one year.
[02:17:00.773 --> 02:17:01.713]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:17:01.713 --> 02:17:06.095]  And that's what also prevents a number of these doctors, I think, to stand up and say things.
[02:17:06.095 --> 02:17:09.936]  It's because they're all being paid for by the Gates Foundation and others.
[02:17:10.475 --> 02:17:13.557]  Yeah, Fauci's just a piece of work.
[02:17:13.557 --> 02:17:17.820]  How many times has he talked about masks, and we still don't know what his position is on masks.
[02:17:17.820 --> 02:17:20.742]  I guess now he's saying it's good to wear masks.
[02:17:20.742 --> 02:17:22.444]  Yeah, oh, it's crazy you don't wear them.
[02:17:22.444 --> 02:17:24.505]  Everybody's got to wear them.
[02:17:24.505 --> 02:17:25.326]  It's just crazy.
[02:17:25.326 --> 02:17:27.787]  So him, Dr. Birx, she has ties.
[02:17:27.787 --> 02:17:30.429]  Her husband worked for the Clinton White House.
[02:17:30.429 --> 02:17:32.531]  She worked under Obama.
[02:17:33.290 --> 02:17:35.451]  She had ties to Fauci as well.
[02:17:35.451 --> 02:17:42.915]  I mean, those two leading this charge, and then it sounds like they were the two that talked President Trump into shutting down the economy.
[02:17:42.915 --> 02:17:44.415]  I've got to be honest with you.
[02:17:44.415 --> 02:17:48.737]  I took the bait thinking, if it's really going to be bad, if he doesn't do something, he'll get blamed.
[02:17:48.737 --> 02:17:51.458]  They were going to do it regardless, and it turned out to be basically a total fraud.
[02:17:51.458 --> 02:17:54.360]  And so you guys were right.
[02:17:54.360 --> 02:17:56.621]  I basically dropped the ball early on.
[02:17:56.621 --> 02:17:59.062]  That's what I'm saying is, you guys have been dead on.
[02:17:59.980 --> 02:18:01.361]  Well, thanks, Alex.
[02:18:01.361 --> 02:18:09.547]  And, you know, but I think, but I, but you know, Trump was in a, it was another one of these no-win situations that the deep states put him in.
[02:18:09.547 --> 02:18:15.812]  Like with the Mueller, Mueller gang, where he, it was clear of, a clear criminal act.
[02:18:15.812 --> 02:18:21.416]  There was no crimes, criminal being on Mueller and Weissman's part.
[02:18:21.416 --> 02:18:22.797]  No crimes ever committed.
[02:18:22.797 --> 02:18:25.138]  They didn't even, the entire,
[02:18:26.261 --> 02:18:31.406]  RussiaGate and Mueller Special Counsel wasn't even based on crime.
[02:18:31.406 --> 02:18:33.908]  It was unconstitutional.
[02:18:33.908 --> 02:18:41.074]  But Trump never allowed this thing to continue so he wouldn't get charged with obstruction.
[02:18:41.074 --> 02:18:45.638]  And I admire his courage and ability to do that because I don't know if I could have.
[02:18:45.638 --> 02:18:46.239]  I totally agree.
[02:18:46.239 --> 02:18:49.282]  But now the Justice Department is scared and Berman isn't going to do anything.
[02:18:49.822 --> 02:18:51.303]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:19:13.427 --> 02:19:16.991]  Now we've got this Judge Sullivan doing the craziest stuff we've ever seen in our lifetime.
[02:19:16.991 --> 02:19:19.835]  Most unbelievable, shocking stuff.
[02:19:19.835 --> 02:19:20.235]  Yeah, does it?
[02:19:20.235 --> 02:19:21.997]  I mean, I know there's mixed groups in the deep state.
[02:19:21.997 --> 02:19:25.481]  There's the ultra-deep state, and it's really worthy American people in the deep state.
[02:19:25.481 --> 02:19:28.264]  But the establishment is crazy.
[02:19:28.264 --> 02:19:33.491]  If they keep trying to have a war with the people, isn't there a smart establishment that realizes this is dangerous?
[02:19:34.329 --> 02:19:35.810]  Well, isn't that true?
[02:19:35.810 --> 02:19:40.054]  I think the people, that's the thing, thank God for the people, not just in the U.S., but around the world.
[02:19:40.054 --> 02:19:41.776]  People are waking up to this stuff.
[02:19:41.776 --> 02:19:48.622]  I think that one of the greatest things that Trump did, other than beating Hillary and being in her head ever since... Was to force the deep state out in the open.
[02:19:49.349 --> 02:19:50.070]  That's right.
[02:19:50.070 --> 02:19:54.295]  And to also point out the fact that our media is corrupt.
[02:19:54.295 --> 02:19:58.901]  And I love that because more and more people now are aware of that.
[02:19:58.901 --> 02:20:04.468]  And that may be maybe his greatest accomplishment because average people are saying, well, I can really see it.
[02:20:04.468 --> 02:20:07.652]  They come up to me and say, Joe, I can really see it, you know.
[02:20:08.132 --> 02:20:09.553]  CNN is garbage.
[02:20:09.553 --> 02:20:11.173]  They really are on attack.
[02:20:11.173 --> 02:20:12.814]  I can't even watch him anymore.
[02:20:12.814 --> 02:20:14.174]  So Trump has done that.
[02:20:14.174 --> 02:20:15.515]  He's brought this awareness.
[02:20:15.515 --> 02:20:16.175]  That's right.
[02:20:16.175 --> 02:20:18.276]  CNN wanted to have fake news until he turned it around.
[02:20:18.276 --> 02:20:25.079]  We come back in the final segment, we'll talk about the new book, Media Matters, and how they get countered, and how you think Trump should proceed.
[02:20:25.079 --> 02:20:30.181]  I think he should bring out the insider trading, bring out the conflicts of interest, destroy Gates, destroy...
[02:20:31.161 --> 02:20:32.402]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[02:20:32.402 --> 02:20:33.162]  Where did it come from?
[02:21:01.158 --> 02:21:03.359]  InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:21:39.909 --> 02:21:42.251]  Other systems, just don't compare.
[02:21:43.874 --> 02:21:46.477]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years.
[02:21:46.477 --> 02:21:59.292]  And if you go back to those shows, we laid out the AI takeover plan, the tracking of cell phones, how programmed master computers would manipulate control society, how they'd be able to not just predict,
[02:21:59.913 --> 02:22:00.734]  We're good to go.
[02:22:19.835 --> 02:22:23.817]  But when we cover that, the media would attack us and say we were making it up.
[02:22:23.817 --> 02:22:29.059]  It was a conspiracy theory, even though it was in the actual corporate level blueprint documents.
[02:22:29.059 --> 02:22:37.323]  Well, the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out.
[02:22:37.323 --> 02:22:40.744]  And it's something about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned.
[02:22:40.744 --> 02:22:42.805]  So we might want to dismantle the system now.
[02:22:45.887 --> 02:22:48.010]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[02:22:48.010 --> 02:22:52.237]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[02:22:52.237 --> 02:22:56.644]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[02:22:56.644 --> 02:22:57.766]  I feel fine.
[02:22:59.625 --> 02:23:04.247]  It's the end of the world as we know it, and I don't feel fine.
[02:23:04.247 --> 02:23:15.270]  This entire takeover has been battle-planned, blueprinted, war-gamed, field-martialed by the psychological war chiefs at the United Nations and the Fortune 100.
[02:23:15.270 --> 02:23:17.351]  This is the post-human takeover.
[02:23:17.351 --> 02:23:21.032]  The noose gets tighter when you comply, not looser.
[02:23:21.852 --> 02:23:24.834]  The entire COVID-19 operation is a hoax.
[02:23:24.834 --> 02:23:30.118]  Now they admit that, quote, death numbers are dropping because those are fake, where they count people that died of something else.
[02:23:30.118 --> 02:23:32.299]  But it's all about how many cases there are.
[02:23:32.299 --> 02:23:35.742]  And now they're saying most of the population will get it.
[02:23:35.742 --> 02:23:38.283]  And then no one can go outside ever again.
[02:23:38.283 --> 02:23:40.405]  It's totally insane.
[02:23:40.405 --> 02:23:41.546]  It's a fraud.
[02:23:41.546 --> 02:23:46.389]  It's all a lie.
[02:23:46.389 --> 02:23:49.031]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:09.155 --> 02:24:09.656]  Welcome back.
[02:24:09.656 --> 02:24:11.638]  Paul Joseph Watson is going to host the fourth hour.
[02:24:11.638 --> 02:24:15.242]  I literally have like 30, 40 incredible breaking stories.
[02:24:15.242 --> 02:24:17.986]  We'll hit next segment after our guest leaves us.
[02:24:17.986 --> 02:24:28.018]  John Hoffman, GatewayPundit.com, twin brother of Jim Hoffman, executive, international businessman, writer for the site, and he's been one of the top people exposing this and walking through it.
[02:24:29.039 --> 02:24:41.944]  We're clearly seeing a multinational corporate takeover with contact tracers, with the Clinton Foundation Global Initiative involved, with Bill and Melinda Gates, with these big corporations with the power to roll out a global social credit score.
[02:24:41.944 --> 02:24:43.464]  They now admit that's what the plan is.
[02:24:43.464 --> 02:24:46.585]  The environmentalists are saying, thank God tourism's basically over.
[02:24:46.585 --> 02:24:47.786]  It's bad for the earth.
[02:24:47.786 --> 02:24:49.606]  The post-industrial world's here.
[02:24:49.606 --> 02:24:51.067]  Humans are bad.
[02:24:51.067 --> 02:24:53.368]  A Wall Street Journal, a dreaming of the end of humanity.
[02:24:54.568 --> 02:24:56.610]  This is really their dystopic coming out.
[02:24:56.610 --> 02:25:01.733]  They had this on the drawing boards, we know, in Event 201 and Lockstep and others.
[02:25:01.733 --> 02:25:06.837]  I think they exacerbated it and launched it early and made it about Trump to try to get rid of him.
[02:25:06.837 --> 02:25:14.523]  And I still think this hoax, too, in the rolling coup will fail if we get around the censors and get the truth out.
[02:25:14.523 --> 02:25:18.125]  Because people instinctively know the truth, but it's so incredibly dangerous.
[02:25:18.125 --> 02:25:22.529]  Joe Hoff, I want to talk in closing about media matters that you brought up earlier.
[02:25:23.129 --> 02:25:23.470]  Yeah, great.
[02:25:23.470 --> 02:25:26.093]  And Alex, let me add one more comment too about these numbers.
[02:25:26.093 --> 02:25:29.556]  The thing that I wanted to point out last segment that I didn't, I'm sorry, was the fact that
[02:25:44.429 --> 02:25:53.177]  The one measurement that we can take that can really kind of tell us how bad this COVID is, is to look at total deaths this year compared to prior years.
[02:25:53.177 --> 02:25:54.918]  And we've done that now.
[02:25:54.918 --> 02:25:58.742]  And when you look at them, this year's deaths, especially related to the flu, etc.
[02:25:59.488 --> 02:26:03.029]  Barely, barely much greater than prior years.
[02:26:03.029 --> 02:26:04.229]  Now, slow down and say that again.
[02:26:04.229 --> 02:26:05.609]  We should have started the whole interview with this.
[02:26:05.609 --> 02:26:16.231]  In fact, when we post this to Bandot Video later, I want to put what you're about to say at the very front of the interview because we can put up the graph showing record testing, but deaths have gone way down from what they claimed.
[02:26:16.231 --> 02:26:25.613]  But let's look at last year's numbers compared to the flatline of death or the range of death compared to now and tell people the name of the article on Gateway Pundit so folks can find it.
[02:26:26.653 --> 02:26:28.174]  We're going to be putting it up here shortly.
[02:26:28.174 --> 02:26:28.915]  How about that?
[02:26:28.915 --> 02:26:30.637]  Good, good.
[02:26:30.637 --> 02:26:34.641]  But we have a PhD who's provided us this information.
[02:26:34.641 --> 02:26:35.902]  It's good analysis.
[02:26:35.902 --> 02:26:37.643]  And again, data is where we need to be.
[02:26:37.643 --> 02:26:40.266]  We don't need to be listening to doctors right now.
[02:26:40.266 --> 02:26:42.948]  We need to be listening to the data analysts.
[02:26:42.948 --> 02:26:43.569]  Let's start over.
[02:26:43.569 --> 02:26:46.372]  Tell people what you're about to break because we're in the zeitgeist.
[02:26:46.372 --> 02:26:51.457]  We've hired a, he's scared to put his name out, but we've hired a highly rated statistician
[02:26:52.037 --> 02:26:56.518]  So what he's done is he's looked at the last five years of mortality rates throughout the U.S.
[02:26:56.518 --> 02:27:00.119]  and he compares them to this year and we're seeing that there's no material increase.
[02:27:00.119 --> 02:27:04.121]  And with the only exception is in New York and New Jersey and New York City, which is the worst.
[02:27:19.705 --> 02:27:23.527]  So, with the exception of that, there's been no increase.
[02:27:23.527 --> 02:27:27.169]  So, not material, not on a material basis.
[02:27:27.169 --> 02:27:34.152]  So, that tells us this thing is not even close to a Spanish flu that took 2% of the world's population.
[02:27:34.152 --> 02:27:36.513]  This thing isn't doing anything like that.
[02:27:37.313 --> 02:27:43.937]  I think that's where you can get around the bogus counting and classifications that the CDC recommends.
[02:27:43.937 --> 02:27:47.099]  It's just, okay, well, let's just look at total deaths, and that's how we get our way.
[02:27:47.099 --> 02:27:47.880]  And let me stop you.
[02:27:47.880 --> 02:27:50.682]  Let's spend the rest of the time on this, because it's so bombshell.
[02:27:50.682 --> 02:27:54.504]  You as a layperson, I as a layperson, are going to look at last year's numbers and see they're the same.
[02:27:54.504 --> 02:27:56.065]  Year before on average, the same.
[02:27:56.065 --> 02:27:57.306]  Year before, higher.
[02:27:57.306 --> 02:28:00.168]  But to have a statistician show it, they can't get around this.
[02:28:00.168 --> 02:28:01.989]  But here's the key, and I know you know the answers.
[02:28:02.589 --> 02:28:23.338]  Why is New York, a few areas of Michigan, because they're blue cities and states, where they intubated people, they admit that's what killed them, and where they sent regular flu and regular pneumonia patients into nursing homes knowing they would get a death number, and the only way you do that in 10 different Democrat states that did it, where you have most of the death, is it was premeditated!
[02:28:23.338 --> 02:28:25.159]  Please talk about that!
[02:28:25.159 --> 02:28:29.641]  That's right, and we did a study too, we compared Democrat and Korean states to Republican,
[02:28:30.040 --> 02:28:37.346]  On at least a two-to-one ratio, you're more likely to die in a Democrat state from the COVID than in a Republican state.
[02:28:37.346 --> 02:28:58.843]  We also, the thing that we know, we had some information, an individual that provides us some really incredible data using artificial intelligence, AI, and he was able to determine that one of the major fundraisers for Cuomo in New York was this
[02:28:59.656 --> 02:29:00.617]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:29:16.141 --> 02:29:18.823]  DeSantis did down in Florida.
[02:29:18.823 --> 02:29:21.364]  What Cuomo did is threw him back into the homes.
[02:29:21.364 --> 02:29:27.148]  The rationale for that is because the homes got a lot more money for a COVID patient.
[02:29:27.148 --> 02:29:32.071]  So he was paying back these people that gave to him in the prior election.
[02:29:32.071 --> 02:29:34.352]  And it was about the money.
[02:29:34.352 --> 02:29:42.637]  And they made a ton of money by throwing COVID patients back into these homes and then it killed all these elderly people.
[02:29:42.637 --> 02:29:45.119]  $50,000 extra when you get a COVID patient and intubate them.
[02:29:46.444 --> 02:29:51.027]  Yeah, and I think it's even more than that in New York, Alex.
[02:29:51.027 --> 02:29:52.387]  I believe it's a lot more per patient.
[02:29:52.387 --> 02:29:53.728]  You're right, that's just the baseline.
[02:29:53.728 --> 02:29:58.510]  It's 13,000 if you have a COVID patient, and then it was like 39,000 if you intubate them.
[02:29:58.510 --> 02:29:59.791]  And you're right, New York even had more.
[02:30:00.799 --> 02:30:01.279]  Yeah.
[02:30:01.279 --> 02:30:05.183]  And, and so when he did that, he created all these deaths.
[02:30:05.183 --> 02:30:10.187]  I think the guy should be, should be investigated and looked at for murder.
[02:30:10.187 --> 02:30:15.872]  I mean, what his policies did, anybody knows that was, that was the wrong thing to do.
[02:30:15.872 --> 02:30:25.921]  It was insanity to throw, to throw these types of individuals back into the homes and where the elderly are, which they're, they are the target of this disease, the COVID.
[02:30:26.334 --> 02:30:28.615]  It's the elderly and the sick.
[02:30:28.615 --> 02:30:34.959]  And Bill Gates just so happens to say he wants death panels here at Old People's, so I guess it's all coming true.
[02:30:34.959 --> 02:30:36.540]  Yeah, it's outrageous.
[02:30:36.540 --> 02:30:37.601]  It's just outrageous.
[02:30:37.601 --> 02:30:40.583]  So yeah, we've seen all these medical organizations tied.
[02:30:40.583 --> 02:30:45.866]  We've seen the Democrats tied into it with the deep state organizations.
[02:30:45.866 --> 02:30:49.248]  We're seeing these bogus numbers coming up today out of Florida.
[02:30:49.248 --> 02:30:53.611]  It's like every day, and the American people need to wake up.
[02:30:53.611 --> 02:30:54.311]  I mean, this is just...
[02:30:54.727 --> 02:30:56.869]  It's outrageous what's been going on.
[02:30:56.869 --> 02:30:58.910]  And I'll tell you one thing that was outrageous.
[02:30:58.910 --> 02:30:59.671]  I'm in Hong Kong.
[02:30:59.671 --> 02:31:07.477]  I'm talking to some really high level executives, and they're just admiring China for the fact that they had better numbers in the U.S.
[02:31:07.477 --> 02:31:11.019]  and they were able to shut it down in such a short period of time, etc.
[02:31:11.019 --> 02:31:14.962]  And I'm about ready to throw up listening to these guys and a couple of good friends of mine.
[02:31:14.962 --> 02:31:19.346]  But that's what's going on with the media, especially in Asia and around the world.
[02:31:19.346 --> 02:31:22.488]  China's done an incredible job of selling themselves.
[02:31:22.836 --> 02:31:32.090]  As doing this great job with the coronavirus when in fact, you know, they started this thing and maybe the question is, did they do it?
[02:31:32.090 --> 02:31:34.874]  Did they do it out of an accident that they did?
[02:31:34.874 --> 02:31:37.178]  Did they do it intentionally because their economy?
[02:31:37.509 --> 02:31:41.050]  It's absolutely being disseminated by Trump.
[02:31:41.050 --> 02:31:42.730]  He's just done an incredible job.
[02:31:42.730 --> 02:31:43.971]  They've lost the trade wars.
[02:31:43.971 --> 02:31:47.092]  The globalists with China decided to release this right on time.
[02:31:47.092 --> 02:31:49.772]  Fauci basically is funding most of the projects in the lab.
[02:31:49.772 --> 02:31:50.652]  So was Gates.
[02:31:50.652 --> 02:31:52.913]  You can't have all those confluence together.
[02:31:52.913 --> 02:31:58.034]  2015, major publications point out that Obama moved the illegal project to that lab.
[02:31:58.034 --> 02:32:00.215]  This has Obama deep state fingerprints all over it.
[02:32:01.021 --> 02:32:01.922]  It sure does.
[02:32:01.922 --> 02:32:02.362]  Sure doesn't.
[02:32:02.362 --> 02:32:04.704]  And Obama was over in China not long ago either.
[02:32:04.704 --> 02:32:06.506]  I don't know if any people remember that.
[02:32:06.506 --> 02:32:07.987]  But he did a visit to China.
[02:32:07.987 --> 02:32:09.008]  I thought, well, that's kind of odd.
[02:32:09.008 --> 02:32:10.910]  What's he doing over in China?
[02:32:10.910 --> 02:32:12.631]  And so, who knows?
[02:32:12.631 --> 02:32:16.274]  But Trump's really done a number on their economy.
[02:32:16.274 --> 02:32:19.057]  I've done a number of posts on that, especially living in Hong Kong.
[02:32:19.057 --> 02:32:19.918]  I could see it.
[02:32:19.918 --> 02:32:21.579]  I could see how that economy had to impact Hong Kong.
[02:32:21.579 --> 02:32:24.982]  Joe, there's a new book, and I know you don't want to plug your new book, but I'm trying to.
[02:32:24.982 --> 02:32:27.624]  I want you to come back for 30 minutes and talk about the book, because I'm excited to read it.
[02:32:27.624 --> 02:32:28.085]  Tell us about it.
[02:32:29.218 --> 02:32:30.220]  Okay, great.
[02:32:30.220 --> 02:32:31.322]  Well, I've got it here.
[02:32:31.322 --> 02:32:32.064]  There it is.
[02:32:32.064 --> 02:32:33.006]  In God We Trust.
[02:32:33.006 --> 02:32:34.929]  Tell us about that lying liberal lunatics.
[02:32:35.931 --> 02:32:49.394]  Not lying liberal lunatics, because it's the deep state, it's the Mueller team, it's the media, the social media, it's all these individuals that are anti-American.
[02:32:49.394 --> 02:32:51.394]  And the Americans, we trust in God.
[02:32:51.394 --> 02:32:53.115]  We don't trust in these demons.
[02:32:53.115 --> 02:32:53.375]  That's right.
[02:32:53.375 --> 02:32:54.415]  The state is not God.
[02:32:54.415 --> 02:32:55.815]  Everybody should get the book.
[02:32:55.815 --> 02:32:57.416]  Everybody should give it to everybody you know.
[02:32:57.416 --> 02:32:59.196]  We're in an information war again.
[02:32:59.196 --> 02:33:00.316]  Put that book back on screen.
[02:33:00.316 --> 02:33:01.277]  I want to read it.
[02:33:01.277 --> 02:33:02.997]  I want a complimentary copy or I'm going to buy one.
[02:33:03.738 --> 02:33:08.486]  It's Joe Hoft, in God we trust, not in lying liberal lunatics.
[02:33:08.486 --> 02:33:13.274]  Come back with your brother or by yourself soon and let's do a review of the book after I've had a chance to read it, my friend.
[02:33:14.164 --> 02:33:16.906]  No, I enjoyed it, Alex, and thanks for all the work you do.
[02:33:16.906 --> 02:33:20.489]  I mean, you're just like every conservative website.
[02:33:20.489 --> 02:33:27.015]  You were targeted, and it's been appalling what's happened, and a lot of people don't know about it, and that's what I put in this book.
[02:33:27.015 --> 02:33:30.738]  It's just the absolute atrocities by our Democrats.
[02:33:30.738 --> 02:33:33.340]  Well, join us again next week, because I want to read the book.
[02:33:33.340 --> 02:33:34.001]  Let's talk about it.
[02:33:34.001 --> 02:33:34.622]  All right.
[02:33:34.622 --> 02:33:36.884]  There goes Joe Hoff to GatewayPundit.com.
[02:33:36.884 --> 02:33:40.527]  We'll be right back with a jam-packed final segment of news, then Paul Watson takes over.
[02:33:42.267 --> 02:33:47.671]  One of the best nutrients nature has provided, beetroot, has been used for hundreds of years in natural medicine.

[02:34:12.938 --> 02:34:16.580]  It's time to take a new, healthier approach to one of your most basic needs.
[02:34:16.580 --> 02:34:23.665]  The Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system is the same water filter that Alex and the Infowars crew use every day for the purest water possible.
[02:34:23.665 --> 02:34:27.647]  You can start cleaning the toxins from your water for clean, healthy, and delicious drinking water.

[02:34:34.611 --> 02:34:38.914]  This groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system is like no other.

[02:34:43.541 --> 02:34:46.782]  That the globalists launch this planetary lockdown.
[02:34:46.782 --> 02:34:50.964]  The number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes.
[02:34:50.964 --> 02:34:55.426]  We've gone over those purposes many times here on air.
[02:34:55.426 --> 02:35:01.488]  The cashless society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, forced inoculation.
[02:35:01.488 --> 02:35:12.553]  But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential as we begin to witness automation computers and robots
[02:35:13.089 --> 02:35:17.733]  Take over the jobs that people once had by design.
[02:35:17.733 --> 02:35:21.796]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[02:35:21.796 --> 02:35:24.939]  It's been pre-planned, organized, globally.
[02:35:24.939 --> 02:35:27.181]  And it's extremely predatory.
[02:35:27.181 --> 02:35:38.970]  And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[02:35:38.970 --> 02:35:42.073]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[02:35:43.642 --> 02:35:45.063]  I've been on air 26 years.
[02:35:45.063 --> 02:35:52.189]  Starting about 24 years ago, I began to get calls from major Hollywood directors, producers, actors.
[02:35:52.189 --> 02:35:55.772]  They wanted to meet with me and they said, what is your formal education?
[02:35:55.772 --> 02:35:57.954]  And I said, well, really nothing but a few years of college.
[02:35:57.954 --> 02:36:03.819]  They said, well, how are you one of the best science fiction or cultural writers we've ever heard?
[02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:08.341]  The stuff you come up with is just unbelievable.
[02:36:08.341 --> 02:36:09.341]  We'd like you to be in movies.
[02:36:09.341 --> 02:36:10.602]  We'd like you to write with us.
[02:36:10.602 --> 02:36:12.542]  We'd like you to do voiceovers.
[02:36:12.542 --> 02:36:13.683]  You're just a renaissance man.
[02:36:13.683 --> 02:36:17.364]  And folks know I was in some movies and Harry Shearer makes statements like that and a lot of others.
[02:36:17.364 --> 02:36:18.664]  I'm not bragging.
[02:36:18.664 --> 02:36:19.705]  And I kept explaining to them.
[02:36:19.705 --> 02:36:21.665]  I said, do you understand?
[02:36:21.665 --> 02:36:23.766]  I didn't come up with any of this.
[02:36:23.766 --> 02:36:28.087]  I'm reading globalist MIT white papers and futurist documents.
[02:36:28.087 --> 02:36:31.048]  And they would just laugh at me and say, oh, no way.
[02:36:31.048 --> 02:36:32.829]  Then I would give them the documents.
[02:36:32.829 --> 02:36:34.049]  They would get very, very scared.
[02:36:34.411 --> 02:36:38.482]  You know, the next time I saw him in a few months, I'd say, man, you're right, this is dystopic.
[02:36:38.482 --> 02:36:41.209]  Folks, I didn't make any of this up, okay?
[02:36:41.209 --> 02:36:42.292]  It's real, it's real.
[02:36:43.018 --> 02:36:47.482]  Storable food is again available for shipping within three to four weeks.
[02:36:47.482 --> 02:36:48.082]  We have it.
[02:36:48.082 --> 02:36:51.585]  It's high quality, but it's got to be packaged and shipped out to you.
[02:36:51.585 --> 02:36:54.127]  Some items are shipping in a week, some in four weeks.
[02:36:54.127 --> 02:36:55.488]  So they're saying three to four weeks.
[02:36:55.488 --> 02:36:56.529]  It's my Patriot.
[02:36:56.529 --> 02:36:57.590]  We have their full catalog.
[02:36:57.590 --> 02:37:00.512]  They're in our back end at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:37:00.512 --> 02:37:05.556]  Get your orders in now before the next big surge comes in.
[02:37:05.556 --> 02:37:10.380]  Believe me, every angle I've looked at tells me that really, really serious times are ahead.
[02:37:10.700 --> 02:37:18.648]  Whether Trump wins or loses, the globalists have already created a worldwide depression, lockdowns on a planetary scale, and it's only intensifying.
[02:37:18.648 --> 02:37:21.851]  This is one of the big boxes you've got to get checked off.
[02:37:21.851 --> 02:37:23.313]  It's high quality, affordable food.
[02:37:23.313 --> 02:37:27.337]  My Patriot has really good, high quality food at a very affordable price.
[02:37:27.637 --> 02:37:29.278]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:37:57.933 --> 02:38:02.836]  It seems like yesterday, but it was long ago.
[02:38:02.836 --> 02:38:12.722]  It seems like yesterday, but it was long ago.
[02:38:12.722 --> 02:38:17.165]  Janie was lovely, she was the queen of my night.
[02:38:17.165 --> 02:38:21.428]  There in the darkness with the radio playing her way.
[02:38:21.428 --> 02:38:23.469]  And the secrets that we shared,
[02:38:26.890 --> 02:38:29.851]  And I remember!
[02:38:29.851 --> 02:38:32.752]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:38:32.752 --> 02:38:36.254]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, still here on air.
[02:38:36.254 --> 02:38:43.797]  Thanks to God's good graces and your support, your prayers, your word of mouth, and your focus.
[02:38:54.557 --> 02:39:00.380]  Yes, the globalists that are running against the wind, against God's will, they're going to fail.
[02:39:00.380 --> 02:39:04.241]  All right, let me hit this right now for you, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:39:04.241 --> 02:39:05.862]  Look at these headlines right here.
[02:39:05.862 --> 02:39:16.006]  BLM supporters celebrate death of mother, shot dead for saying all lives matter when confronted by black racist thugs.
[02:39:16.006 --> 02:39:19.388]  She said, yes, they matter, but white lives matter too, so they shot her dead.
[02:39:20.356 --> 02:39:28.063]  Facebook, Twitter, the left is celebrating it saying thank God one less dead white or one more dead white person.
[02:39:28.063 --> 02:39:31.306]  Totally and absolutely sickening.
[02:39:31.306 --> 02:39:34.269]  So let me just go ahead and start over with this article for you.
[02:39:34.269 --> 02:39:36.771]  Let's just focus in on a real person that got killed right here.
[02:39:36.771 --> 02:39:40.975]  You can have an overhead shot.
[02:39:40.975 --> 02:39:44.258]  We're just going to sit here for a moment and look at somebody that died.
[02:39:45.424 --> 02:39:53.751]  And think about them for just a second, because the globalists don't want us to humanize any of these people.
[02:39:53.751 --> 02:40:03.559]  When George Floyd died, I played the video and said it looked terrible and thought the officer was wrong and that he should get in trouble.
[02:40:03.559 --> 02:40:10.305]  Turned out he was on enough fentanyl to kill two grown men and was in excited delirium and had been fighting them for 20 minutes and had been asked to be put on the ground.
[02:40:10.967 --> 02:40:12.648]  The officer wasn't thinking, being an idiot.
[02:40:12.648 --> 02:40:19.832]  He actually knew him from the nightclub and was putting his knee on his carotid artery because of the training they were given in Minneapolis-St.
[02:40:19.832 --> 02:40:23.654]  Paul, which was horrible, and he died.
[02:40:23.654 --> 02:40:29.797]  You think that cop did that on purpose so he'd have a dead black guy so that he would get in trouble?
[02:40:29.797 --> 02:40:32.418]  No, cops don't want that, even the most racist cops.
[02:40:32.418 --> 02:40:33.739]  And there are racist cops of every color.
[02:40:35.168 --> 02:40:49.855]  But when you see articles buried in the news every day of a black cop, a white cop, a Hispanic cop, a white woman, an old white man being shot, being killed, being murdered, being stabbed, it doesn't even hardly even make the news nationally.
[02:40:49.855 --> 02:40:52.236]  And if they do, they don't point out it's racial.
[02:40:52.236 --> 02:40:59.700]  So look at this headline, BLM supporters celebrate death of mother shot dead for saying all lives matter, and they celebrate it.
[02:41:01.305 --> 02:41:02.486]  And then look at this.
[02:41:02.486 --> 02:41:08.273]  Leftists celebrate Ghislaine Maxwell, a feminist icon who could bring down Trump.
[02:41:08.273 --> 02:41:15.281]  Prominent Democrats are saying, oh, she's going to bring Trump down when Trump's not implicated.
[02:41:15.281 --> 02:41:20.528]  It's the Clintons and others that are documented to be involved, and that she's a sign of female power.
[02:41:23.223 --> 02:41:28.747]  The left defends and promotes anything and everything that leftists engage in.
[02:41:28.747 --> 02:41:37.212]  Because Ghislaine Maxwell was a leftist, they're defending her when she helped traffic girls as young as five years of age, reportedly.
[02:41:37.212 --> 02:41:41.075]  That story's on Infowars.com with the links.
[02:41:41.075 --> 02:41:44.156]  And that takes us to this next story, the one I'm about to break down.
[02:41:44.156 --> 02:41:49.060]  Another Infowars.com article that links to the Washington Post, the Associated Press, you name it.
[02:41:49.060 --> 02:41:49.960]  New court filings.
[02:41:49.960 --> 02:41:51.962]  Ghislaine Maxwell fled across
[02:41:53.044 --> 02:41:57.589]  House, during raid, FBI found tinfoil wrapped cell phones.
[02:41:57.589 --> 02:42:02.033]  They have the affidavits here, where they're saying she shouldn't be released on bond.
[02:42:02.033 --> 02:42:10.641]  Though some of the left are saying she should be, because she tried to get out of the house and get away from them, and they found her with a phone she was trying to get rid of, wrapped in tinfoil.
[02:42:10.641 --> 02:42:11.922]  Now why would she do that?
[02:42:11.922 --> 02:42:16.407]  Because the big genius spy did not have one of these.
[02:42:16.407 --> 02:42:17.128]  And now I'm going to plug.
[02:42:18.103 --> 02:42:22.247]  This is a Privacy Pocket 1995.
[02:42:22.247 --> 02:42:25.510]  Other people sell these with the Copper Faraday Cage for $30.
[02:42:25.510 --> 02:42:28.433]  That's a 200% markup.
[02:42:28.433 --> 02:42:30.776]  This is a 100% markup.
[02:42:30.776 --> 02:42:31.937]  You cannot get a better deal.
[02:42:31.937 --> 02:42:35.921]  These are the best pockets they take from small to large cell phones.
[02:42:35.921 --> 02:42:38.724]  We have them in red, royal blue, green, and black.
[02:42:39.906 --> 02:42:54.905]  You put your phone in it and then all the cell towers that every few seconds are pinging where you're at and tracking and getting your data and selling it to the highest bidder and hackers that are busy stealing the data and all the other big corporations have different wireless systems that are stealing your data as well.
[02:42:54.905 --> 02:42:56.026]  You protect yourself.
[02:42:57.096 --> 02:43:04.759]  And your data from the Bill and Melinda Gates and the Clinton Foundation contact tracers, you protect yourself from all of these people.
[02:43:04.759 --> 02:43:13.102]  And it is so critical that all of us habituate ourselves and get in the habit now of putting our cell phones, we're not using them, in one of these.
[02:43:13.102 --> 02:43:16.723]  It'll still go in your pocket like it's no big deal.
[02:43:16.723 --> 02:43:18.123]  I fit my cell phone right in here.
[02:43:18.123 --> 02:43:20.024]  I slide it right in.
[02:43:21.926 --> 02:43:26.791]  It easily folds over, fits in my pocket, slips right in, back pocket, front pocket, or inside of your coat.
[02:43:27.938 --> 02:43:30.240]  And you've got it, and they can't track and trace you.
[02:43:30.240 --> 02:43:35.103]  And when you want to take your phone out, then you take your phone out, and it doesn't know where you've gone or what you've done.
[02:43:35.103 --> 02:43:37.245]  This is a basic thing like locking your front door.
[02:43:37.245 --> 02:43:40.887]  It's a basic thing like putting clothes on when you go outside during the day.
[02:43:40.887 --> 02:43:44.730]  It needs to be done, and it's a great product at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:43:44.730 --> 02:43:45.850]  Very affordably priced.
[02:43:45.850 --> 02:43:50.254]  Get your protection privacy pockets at InfoWarsTore.com today or 888-253-3139.
[02:43:50.254 --> 02:43:51.074]  Whatever you do, take action.
[02:43:51.074 --> 02:43:51.534]  Now, separately,
[02:44:00.051 --> 02:44:01.971]  I don't do gimmicks.
[02:44:01.971 --> 02:44:07.352]  And so to say, like a furniture store will do, going out of sale, sale.
[02:44:07.352 --> 02:44:11.273]  Or, oh, last day of the sale, and you drive by and the sign's up there for a month.
[02:44:11.273 --> 02:44:13.313]  Because that'll spur people on, I want the last day of the sale.
[02:44:13.313 --> 02:44:15.734]  I don't do that.
[02:44:15.734 --> 02:44:26.536]  When I tell you our supply chain's broken down, and a lot of the products that we like to get, that you like to buy, we can't even get anymore, because the companies have gone out of business, or they're short-staffed, or they can't get the ingredients.
[02:44:26.536 --> 02:44:27.496]  That's really happening.
[02:44:28.916 --> 02:44:39.446]  And I have a whole stack of news here about the breakdown of the food supply and the food chain, and now lockdown too is just going to create a total depression that will make the worldwide depression that we already are in look tame.
[02:44:39.446 --> 02:44:43.850]  Nine products, nine products that we have, we can't get.
[02:44:43.850 --> 02:44:53.659]  I said two yesterday, it's actually three are just going to be discontinued because you can't get the ingredients that are proprietary anymore because the labs and places that put it out don't exist anymore.
[02:44:53.659 --> 02:44:54.600]  Maybe it's going to come back.
[02:44:56.124 --> 02:44:57.104]  That's where we are.
[02:44:57.104 --> 02:44:58.985]  So, this is what happened.
[02:44:58.985 --> 02:45:04.667]  Over a year ago, before the Democratic Party came after us, we're selling colloidal silver toothpaste that was a bestseller.
[02:45:04.667 --> 02:45:08.148]  You know, they can sell it at stores and sell it at Walmart, but we can't because we're bad.
[02:45:08.148 --> 02:45:10.109]  We're about to file a lawsuit and we'll be back soon.
[02:45:10.109 --> 02:45:12.930]  But you're saying, where is the toothpaste?
[02:45:12.930 --> 02:45:16.871]  Well, we didn't come out with this because we don't have the colloidal silver toothpaste.
[02:45:16.871 --> 02:45:18.191]  This has been over a year in the making.
[02:45:18.191 --> 02:45:20.852]  My dad's a retired dentist.
[02:45:20.852 --> 02:45:22.413]  I said, Dad, the listeners really want
[02:45:23.988 --> 02:45:25.309]  They're begging.
[02:45:25.309 --> 02:45:28.952]  They're demanding for activated charcoal toothpaste.
[02:45:28.952 --> 02:45:33.795]  So I started trying it, and I said, quite frankly, big brand names are amazing.
[02:45:33.795 --> 02:45:36.598]  I'll say it, Tom's of Maine is like a great toothpaste.
[02:45:36.598 --> 02:45:40.901]  Next to our tooth whitening, it'd be my favorite of, if I didn't have the tooth whitening toothpaste.
[02:45:40.901 --> 02:45:42.002]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[02:45:42.002 --> 02:45:45.264]  The way it goes in, it strips everything off, but still safely, doesn't hurt the enamel.
[02:45:45.264 --> 02:45:47.145]  The way it binds to things, it's just amazing.
[02:45:47.145 --> 02:45:48.426]  But it's full of fillers.
[02:45:48.426 --> 02:45:49.507]  It's one of those other big brands.
[02:45:49.507 --> 02:45:51.349]  We can't sell this yet because there's something called
[02:45:52.415 --> 02:45:54.758]  A certificate of authenticity.
[02:45:54.758 --> 02:45:56.180]  We've already done all the other testing.
[02:45:56.180 --> 02:45:58.562]  This isn't until next week to do the testing right now.
[02:45:58.562 --> 02:46:00.024]  We know it's going to pass.
[02:46:00.024 --> 02:46:10.316]  But I was about to launch this as my new sale this week until our FDA compliance officer came in and said, you haven't gotten the certificate of authenticity on the toothpaste or the mouthwash yet.
[02:46:10.316 --> 02:46:11.378]  It comes in on Monday.
[02:46:13.365 --> 02:46:23.072]  So that's why I said the other sale a week past time to get rid of it, because we're selling all the products and stuff isn't coming in for months, maybe never again.
[02:46:23.072 --> 02:46:26.174]  We need to sell it at full price to fund ourselves.
[02:46:26.174 --> 02:46:26.895]  That's how sales work.
[02:46:26.895 --> 02:46:31.338]  You've got a bunch of it, you can sell it for sale, but why sell it at sale if you're not going to have it anyways?
[02:46:33.689 --> 02:46:35.711]  So that's kind of how this works, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:46:35.711 --> 02:46:40.637]  But then you guys are habituated not to buy something unless it's on sale.
[02:46:40.637 --> 02:46:42.499]  So we like to do the sales.
[02:46:42.499 --> 02:46:44.722]  That's how we fund the operation.
[02:46:44.722 --> 02:46:51.310]  But to replace this sale, because I am unable to bring you this new product yet,
[02:46:52.554 --> 02:46:56.095]  We are launching, I was talking to Tim Virginia, I said, well, what's the sale going to be?
[02:46:56.095 --> 02:46:58.155]  Because we're almost about to sell out all this stuff.
[02:46:58.155 --> 02:47:03.157]  He said, well, a lot of other stuff we still have, so you can still do the sale with that and leave the old stuff on there.
[02:47:03.157 --> 02:47:05.657]  Hopefully that takes the weight off of that, because the listeners love it.
[02:47:05.657 --> 02:47:11.699]  Because the truth is, when we sell the stuff at 50% off, we sell so much more that it ends up making more money than going to full price.
[02:47:11.699 --> 02:47:16.880]  But then it just habituates and it creates a bunch of problems, and then we've got to sell even more, and then it's a catch-22.
[02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:18.181]  So, here's the deal.
[02:47:18.181 --> 02:47:18.641]  You want it?
[02:47:20.083 --> 02:47:20.643]  You got it.
[02:47:20.643 --> 02:47:22.824]  You got the Christmas in July sale.
[02:47:22.824 --> 02:47:23.724]  It's the last sale.
[02:47:23.724 --> 02:47:24.565]  Storewide free shipping.
[02:47:24.565 --> 02:47:26.286]  Double Patriot points.
[02:47:26.286 --> 02:47:32.628]  But all the stuff like BioTruth, Selenium, SuperFilm, Vitality, ExtendoWise, those are 50% off when they weren't.
[02:47:32.628 --> 02:47:34.769]  RainForce Plus is 50% off when it wasn't.
[02:47:34.769 --> 02:47:36.650]  TurboForce is 50% off when it wasn't.
[02:47:36.650 --> 02:47:40.071]  Survival Shield X2 is 50% off when it wasn't.
[02:47:40.071 --> 02:47:41.712]  Lung, and then all the stuff that was on sale.
[02:47:41.712 --> 02:47:47.214]  Lung Cleanse, Vitamineral Fusion, Bodies, Ultra 12, Azobeats, DNA Force, Winter Plus, Winter 7 Plus.
[02:47:47.214 --> 02:47:48.374]  Living Defense wasn't on there.
[02:47:48.374 --> 02:47:49.415]  Chill Force wasn't on there.
[02:47:50.689 --> 02:47:52.733]  All other stuff wasn't on there.
[02:47:52.733 --> 02:47:55.898]  So it's a big giant sale going and it funds the operation.
[02:47:55.898 --> 02:47:58.382]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:47:58.382 --> 02:47:59.444]  I will run this through.
[02:47:59.444 --> 02:48:03.590]  I'm going to say Tuesday because we need to get the certificate.
[02:48:04.625 --> 02:48:07.027]  Other people don't get certificates, we get them all, okay?
[02:48:07.027 --> 02:48:08.147]  Because we know we're under attack.
[02:48:08.147 --> 02:48:12.630]  We know when they try to come in here and arrest us, we got everything we need.
[02:48:12.630 --> 02:48:14.652]  Plus, we want you to get a product anyways.
[02:48:14.652 --> 02:48:21.336]  I mean, most of the products we sell are above Prop 65 California, where there's more lead in the air than you can have in a product.
[02:48:21.336 --> 02:48:25.679]  So, that's the level of testing we do, but it causes a problem to you and someone not having stuff.
[02:48:25.679 --> 02:48:28.922]  So, hopefully we'll be able to sell you the new charcoal toothpaste next week.
[02:48:28.922 --> 02:48:29.342]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:32.771 --> 02:48:39.875]  So I was taking care of an errand this morning, and I wasn't even close to downtown, but I was parked on a little side street going to this business.
[02:48:39.875 --> 02:48:48.840]  When I came back out, I saw what looked like two Asian folks, probably Chinese, walking down the sidewalk about 50 yards up ahead of me.
[02:48:48.840 --> 02:48:53.582]  And here I am parked a truck with the windows up, and the woman stops and points at me.
[02:48:53.582 --> 02:48:56.864]  So they stop, and they wait while I'm inside my truck.
[02:48:56.864 --> 02:48:59.125]  Truck started, and they sit there and stretch.
[02:48:59.125 --> 02:48:59.926]  She keeps pointing.
[02:49:00.566 --> 02:49:02.572]  And they put their hands out like they're waiting for me.
[02:49:03.905 --> 02:49:08.348]  To go, because I'm not wearing a mask inside my car.
[02:49:08.348 --> 02:49:12.310]  And so then I just sat there, so they acted angry and walked past me.
[02:49:12.310 --> 02:49:17.653]  I almost shot a video of it on my phone, but everybody sees this stuff happening everywhere.
[02:49:17.653 --> 02:49:18.614]  This is mental illness.
[02:49:18.614 --> 02:49:22.196]  People are pulling guns on folks that aren't wearing masks.
[02:49:22.196 --> 02:49:23.617]  This is all cult programming.
[02:49:23.617 --> 02:49:25.198]  This is all about submitting.
[02:49:25.198 --> 02:49:28.040]  We cannot submit to this UN brainwashing.
[02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:29.440]  It's all a giant fraud.
[02:49:29.440 --> 02:49:31.722]  We must expose the fraud or become slaves to it.
[02:49:33.447 --> 02:49:36.428]  I know what we'll do to make them conform to our cult.
[02:49:36.428 --> 02:49:38.930]  We'll all tell them to wear masks or they're gonna die.
[02:49:38.930 --> 02:49:44.992]  And then we'll release the pressure for a while, then bring it back and squeeze it harder, and release it again, and we'll be the virtuous ignorers.
[02:49:44.992 --> 02:49:50.455]  We'll be the angels, even though our lord and master Bill Gates helped fund the whole COVID-19.
[02:49:50.455 --> 02:49:51.395]  No!
[02:49:51.395 --> 02:49:54.177]  Don't sadookie me!
[02:49:55.017 --> 02:50:04.887]  That's right, that's the code word for Bill Gates's operation he carries out with his good little buddy Dr. Fauci in the surgeon cult.
[02:50:04.887 --> 02:50:11.233]  Because you know for girls there's five different types of villains they secretly desire in the romance novels.
[02:50:11.233 --> 02:50:13.516]  One of them is the vampire, the werewolf, the
[02:50:14.236 --> 02:50:17.758]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:50:56.067 --> 02:51:01.871]  They say that life's a carousel.
[02:51:01.871 --> 02:51:02.891]  Welcome back.
[02:51:02.891 --> 02:51:15.179]  Paul Joseph Watson is about to take over.
[02:51:15.179 --> 02:51:22.463]  But where should we start here in the final segment ahead of this next hour with Paul Watson in the War Room coming up?
[02:51:22.463 --> 02:51:24.004]  I've got so much here to cover.
[02:51:26.687 --> 02:51:28.067]  Look at this.
[02:51:28.067 --> 02:51:31.809]  I just showed you where the left is celebrating Ghislaine Maxwell as a powerful woman.
[02:51:31.809 --> 02:51:33.649]  Knows how to take charge.
[02:51:33.649 --> 02:51:36.190]  They're celebrating the poor white lady shot dead in St.
[02:51:36.190 --> 02:51:37.571]  Louis because she was white.
[02:51:37.571 --> 02:51:42.772]  Daughter of slain police officer accosted on Twitter for hashtag BlueLivesMatter.
[02:51:42.772 --> 02:51:51.335]  These are... I've never seen villains that behave this evil as Black Lives Matter and leftists.
[02:51:51.335 --> 02:51:53.596]  But they've never had repercussions for the things they do.
[02:51:56.604 --> 02:52:00.865]  I mean, I grew up in Dallas, where if you looked at somebody wrong, they'd jump out of their car and start fighting you.
[02:52:00.865 --> 02:52:02.706]  See, these leftists have never had repercussions.
[02:52:02.706 --> 02:52:09.508]  JPMorgan reports highest quarterly revenue ever, despite coronavirus pandemic, because they engineered the whole thing.
[02:52:09.508 --> 02:52:10.349]  It's actuary.
[02:52:10.349 --> 02:52:11.709]  They're consolidating power.
[02:52:11.709 --> 02:52:12.649]  Same thing with big tech.
[02:52:12.649 --> 02:52:15.050]  They're taking over the economy and forcing us in.
[02:52:15.050 --> 02:52:16.611]  You thought Walmart was predatory?
[02:52:16.611 --> 02:52:17.271]  This is beyond that.
[02:52:19.673 --> 02:52:22.916]  And I've got hundreds of articles I can sit here and read off, but this is so important.
[02:52:22.916 --> 02:52:27.099]  COVID Testing Scandal, 333 Labs Report.
[02:52:27.099 --> 02:52:28.260]  333 Labs Report in Florida.
[02:52:28.260 --> 02:52:30.963]  100% people testing positive for Corona.
[02:52:30.963 --> 02:52:32.824]  That's how they panic you.
[02:52:32.824 --> 02:52:35.086]  The wicked flee when none pursueth.
[02:52:35.086 --> 02:52:36.948]  That's the Bible verse.
[02:52:36.948 --> 02:52:41.471]  But those that are with God are as strong as... Will you fill up the next verse, guys?
[02:52:41.471 --> 02:52:42.833]  The wicked flee when none pursueth.
[02:52:43.524 --> 02:52:45.246]  With those in the spirit of God, stand firm.
[02:52:45.246 --> 02:52:46.447]  I think that's basically the verse.
[02:52:46.447 --> 02:52:48.348]  I'm paraphrasing it.
[02:52:48.348 --> 02:52:49.529]  But just think about that.
[02:52:49.529 --> 02:52:55.294]  And everybody kind of quietly knows, oh, if you talk about that, you might get banned on Twitter or Facebook.
[02:52:55.294 --> 02:52:56.455]  So the people don't.
[02:52:56.455 --> 02:52:58.998]  So the fraud continues.
[02:52:58.998 --> 02:52:59.518]  Video.
[02:52:59.518 --> 02:53:00.899]  Portland communist mistake.
[02:53:00.899 --> 02:53:02.801]  Random Asian man for journalist.
[02:53:02.801 --> 02:53:06.364]  Andy NGO.
[02:53:06.364 --> 02:53:07.165]  No.
[02:53:07.165 --> 02:53:08.246]  And try to attack him.
[02:53:09.394 --> 02:53:11.916]  Because, you know, they think all Asians look the same.
[02:53:11.916 --> 02:53:13.618]  That's just how crazy these people are.
[02:53:13.618 --> 02:53:22.525]  And more and more of them, it turns out, are weathermen and are terrorists and are involved in all of this crazy garbage.
[02:53:22.525 --> 02:53:27.630]  But that's just the reality of the world that we live in.
[02:53:28.746 --> 02:53:31.869]  And the reality of where all of this craziness has gone.
[02:53:31.869 --> 02:53:34.312]  But the answer is don't give in to them.
[02:53:34.312 --> 02:53:36.054]  Don't let them make you submit.
[02:53:36.054 --> 02:53:48.528]  Because this agenda of COVID-19 is about world government, the UN being in charge, making you follow ridiculous orders, stay in your house, martial law, cashless society, tracking apps on your phone.
[02:53:51.007 --> 02:53:57.851]  The contact tracers coming into your house and all over the country and all over the world are saying, get rid of cash, get rid of change.
[02:53:57.851 --> 02:53:59.473]  It's bad in COVID.
[02:53:59.473 --> 02:54:00.673]  A human touched it.
[02:54:00.673 --> 02:54:01.654]  It's dirty.
[02:54:01.654 --> 02:54:02.354]  You're bad.
[02:54:02.354 --> 02:54:03.495]  Your breath is bad.
[02:54:03.495 --> 02:54:05.176]  Your touch is bad.
[02:54:05.176 --> 02:54:06.437]  Everything you do is bad.
[02:54:06.437 --> 02:54:07.678]  You don't have a Midas touch.
[02:54:07.678 --> 02:54:08.478]  You have an evil touch.
[02:54:08.478 --> 02:54:10.540]  Here's the article on fullwords.com.
[02:54:10.540 --> 02:54:14.943]  Kroger stops giving customers change as nationwide coin shortage worsens.
[02:54:15.984 --> 02:54:20.310]  Because now the Feds won't make the change so they can force this off the cash.
[02:54:20.310 --> 02:54:20.730]  And guess what?
[02:54:20.730 --> 02:54:26.318]  They've got the same shortages in different parts of the world.
[02:54:26.318 --> 02:54:29.002]  Alright, that's it for my part of this transmission.
[02:54:29.002 --> 02:54:29.883]  Very blessed to be here.
[02:54:29.883 --> 02:54:31.205]  Very honored that you're watching.
[02:54:31.205 --> 02:54:32.366]  Very honored that you're listening.
[02:54:33.246 --> 02:54:39.112]  I want to encourage every listener, every viewer, to support those local radio stations, to tell people about them.
[02:54:39.112 --> 02:54:40.494]  That's king.
[02:54:40.494 --> 02:54:51.406]  And to tell people how you're watching online and to continue to spread the links at NewsWars.com and Band.Video because that's, again, I know you already know this, but think about it every day when you're talking to people, you're in the street, you're at church, you're at work, wherever.
[02:54:51.406 --> 02:54:52.267]  Hey!
[02:54:52.267 --> 02:54:53.808]  Heard about Alex Jones, that demonized guy?
[02:54:53.808 --> 02:54:54.789]  Heard about all the things he does?
[02:54:55.711 --> 02:54:59.193]  Heard about, you know, all the stuff you're not supposed to see?
[02:54:59.193 --> 02:55:00.714]  Well, let's just say he's a bad guy.
[02:55:00.714 --> 02:55:05.216]  You ought to hear what this crazy, evil guy, you ought to hear what Satan has to say.
[02:55:05.216 --> 02:55:06.037]  You've heard of Satan?
[02:55:06.037 --> 02:55:07.758]  Well, wow, tune into it.
[02:55:07.758 --> 02:55:10.419]  I mean, literally, a lot of us are like, oh, I want to hear Satan.
[02:55:10.419 --> 02:55:12.300]  I'll tune in, and they'll hear the opposite.
[02:55:12.300 --> 02:55:17.383]  But seriously, just however you do it, get it out there, because that's how we change the world.
[02:55:17.383 --> 02:55:20.225]  And when you're a guest on the show, tell people you're coming on.
[02:55:20.885 --> 02:55:24.647]  When you're Paul Watson about to take over, you know, be sure and tweet out that you're about to host.
[02:55:24.647 --> 02:55:26.387]  I mean, promote InfoWars.
[02:55:26.387 --> 02:55:28.328]  It's the real black sheep.
[02:55:28.328 --> 02:55:29.549]  It's the avant-garde.
[02:55:29.549 --> 02:55:31.430]  It's the real cutting edge.
[02:55:31.430 --> 02:55:35.371]  It is what needs to be celebrated to override the New World Order.
[02:55:35.371 --> 02:55:37.832]  Paul Joseph Watson takes over in 60 seconds.
[02:55:37.832 --> 02:55:38.793]  Please stay with us.
[02:55:41.485 --> 02:55:51.818]  The bad news is Western governments have totally let multinational big tech bring in communist Chinese style total net surveillance, censorship with AI.
[02:55:51.818 --> 02:55:56.524]  The good news is they had to do that to carry out this world government COVID takeover.
[02:55:57.205 --> 02:56:05.550]  This planetary corporate reset that COVID covers for, because the truth is powerful and will defeat them and will smash them.
[02:56:05.550 --> 02:56:25.441]  And the good news is there's still sites like band.video, newswars.com, infowars.com, paulwatsonsitesummit.news, and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive traffic thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen, that is the master of our own
[02:56:26.101 --> 02:56:27.122]  Destinies.
[02:56:27.122 --> 02:56:34.046]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality, a war on civilization, a war on our health, a war on our economy.
[02:56:34.046 --> 02:56:38.568]  But being aware of it, and standing up to it, and speaking out against it, will defeat it.
[02:56:38.568 --> 02:56:44.631]  So take action, or be slaves!
[02:56:44.631 --> 02:56:54.197]  Transmitting worldwide, from the Summit.News studios in the United Kingdom, you are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:56:58.374 --> 02:57:02.781]  Of course, in America, we've seen mass protests for racial justice.
[02:57:02.781 --> 02:57:04.083]  We've also seen mass protests
[02:57:12.822 --> 02:57:15.024]  Against lockdown laws.
[02:57:15.024 --> 02:57:21.628]  The only one apparently that COVID-19 avoids in those instances is the BLM protests because COVID's now woke of course.
[02:57:21.628 --> 02:57:28.993]  It has a gained sentient understanding of who it can infect and who it can't apparently based on their politics.
[02:57:28.993 --> 02:57:35.338]  Which goes straight to the fact, as I said before, the mask has become the political tool.
[02:57:35.338 --> 02:57:38.500]  In America if you're not wearing the mask you're a filthy reprobate
[02:57:39.882 --> 02:57:44.266]  Trump supporter, another deplorable in the United Kingdom.
[02:57:44.266 --> 02:57:51.632]  You are a dirty, racist, bigoted Brexit supporter if you're not wearing the mask.
[02:57:51.632 --> 02:58:09.026]  And now in his infinite wisdom, Boris Johnson, who has got basically every coronavirus decision wrong at every step of the way, is now saying he will introduce a new law, which by the way won't take effect for 10 days, forcing everyone to wear, via mandatory enforcement
[02:58:09.577 --> 02:58:12.400]  Coronavirus masks when they go into shops.
[02:58:12.400 --> 02:58:16.383]  Now, if it's so important, why isn't it already in place?
[02:58:16.383 --> 02:58:18.485]  And why hasn't he announced it immediately?
[02:58:18.485 --> 02:58:20.307]  He could have said from tomorrow.
[02:58:20.307 --> 02:58:26.532]  When we had the lockdown, Boris Johnson got up on television and said, this takes effect from tomorrow.
[02:58:26.532 --> 02:58:32.197]  This mandatory mask law is not even going to take effect for another 10 days!
[02:58:32.197 --> 02:58:36.581]  If it's so important, why are we waiting 10, 11, 12 days until this takes effect?
[02:58:37.188 --> 02:58:42.290]  And of course the only thing this is going to do is further hamstring the economic recovery.
[02:58:42.290 --> 02:58:47.812]  Quarter of the shops that I see in the high street are already closed or not even open yet.
[02:58:47.812 --> 02:58:54.054]  And it's going to create yet another army of petty authoritarian enforcers.
[02:58:54.054 --> 02:59:02.337]  We're going to get to the stage where going into a restaurant, going into a shop, going into a bar is almost as insufferable as going through airport security.
[02:59:03.653 --> 02:59:11.975]  All for a virus which killed in the UK less people than the 2017-2018 flu season.
[02:59:11.975 --> 02:59:26.538]  For a virus that has killed or will kill 50,000 cancer victims because they weren't able to get cancer treatment over the past three months because they were scared of going into hospitals or because those hospitals withdrew the treatment.
[02:59:26.538 --> 02:59:27.759]  A virus that's going to cause 1.5 million
[02:59:29.835 --> 02:59:37.022]  TB infections globally, deaths that is, because again people aren't getting treatment.
[02:59:37.022 --> 02:59:52.698]  I went to a restaurant the other day, they've got temperature scans, they've got NHS track and trace, they ask you to put your information into a database so the government can track you down, maybe knock on your door if you've broken the latest installation of the latest lockdown law.
[02:59:53.709 --> 03:00:04.652]  Now in cities in the UK like Leicester and Blackburn, they're reintroducing all the previous lockdown laws as we said they would do, turning the tap on and off on a whim.
[03:00:04.652 --> 03:00:21.717]  I went into a restaurant the other day and it's not just the people enforcing this, it's the rest of the population and if you look at the polls in the UK, still the clear majority not only support current lockdown measures but want them to be toughened, want them to go back to something that's even more draconian
[03:00:22.591 --> 03:00:22.971]  We're good.
[03:00:43.948 --> 03:00:51.374]  Waiting for the waiter to seat them, politely said, excuse me, excuse me, as I stood behind them twice.
[03:00:51.374 --> 03:00:54.836]  No response, completely lost in their own world on their phones.
[03:00:54.836 --> 03:00:57.078]  So I walked past them.
[03:00:57.078 --> 03:00:58.299]  And again, what did they say?
[03:00:58.299 --> 03:01:00.581]  That's not social distancing!
[03:01:00.581 --> 03:01:02.242]  These people love it!
[03:01:02.242 --> 03:01:08.206]  They love being given this petty power to abuse and harass everyone else.
[03:01:08.206 --> 03:01:11.689]  I mean, you've seen the videos out of America, people going into Walmart, God forbid.
[03:01:12.307 --> 03:01:15.108]  Forgetting or refusing to wearing a mask.
[03:01:15.108 --> 03:01:21.349]  They get publicly shamed and humiliated and that's just another reason to do that.
[03:01:21.349 --> 03:01:24.030]  Now, headline out of Summit News.
[03:01:24.030 --> 03:01:31.412]  Chair of Met Police Federation says it will be impossible to enforce mandatory face masks in shops.
[03:01:31.412 --> 03:01:40.474]  Given that what happened during the end of March-April period when we literally had police in this country inspecting people's shopping bags
[03:01:41.266 --> 03:01:48.313]  To see if they bought essential items, and if they bought a couple of bottles of wine, well that's not essential.
[03:01:48.313 --> 03:01:51.276]  They were literally fining people for that.
[03:01:51.276 --> 03:01:56.222]  They were literally fining people for allowing their children to play out in their back garden.
[03:01:56.222 --> 03:01:58.264]  Which wasn't even against the law.
[03:01:59.818 --> 03:02:15.501]  Now they're going to be empowered to fine people for not wearing a mask, but the chair of the London Metropolitan Police Foundation says it will be, quote, nigh on impossible to enforce a new law which makes the wearing of face masks mandatory in all shops in England from July 24th.
[03:02:15.501 --> 03:02:29.104]  Given, of course, coronavirus deaths are at their lowest ever in Scotland, there's been zero coronavirus deaths for the past six days, the virus is completely under control, yet the lockdown measures are getting more stringent.
[03:02:31.178 --> 03:02:36.642]  There's people who refuse or forget to wear the mask, so it's a possible £100 fine for non-compliance.
[03:02:36.642 --> 03:02:43.106]  But according to Ken Marsh, who represents police officers in London, imposing the new law is virtually inconceivable.
[03:02:43.106 --> 03:02:45.148]  He said, quote, Of course, given
[03:02:51.690 --> 03:02:56.593]  The stabbings haven't stopped, the acid attacks haven't stopped, the serious crimes haven't stopped.
[03:02:56.593 --> 03:03:04.637]  We had police last year tell British citizens we're not going to respond to some burglaries because we don't have the staff, we don't have the resources.
[03:03:04.637 --> 03:03:12.201]  But they're going to be asked to respond to people who, God forbid, don't wear their face nappy, their slave mask.
[03:03:12.201 --> 03:03:13.161]  And this is the nub of it.
[03:03:13.161 --> 03:03:16.743]  He pointed out the burden would fall on shopkeepers to stop refuse nicks.
[03:03:17.327 --> 03:03:23.010]  Although since they have no power to detain, individuals would just leave before police could arrive.
[03:03:23.010 --> 03:03:31.774]  So you're going to have this army of minimum wage shop attendants being given de facto police power to detain people.
[03:03:31.774 --> 03:03:33.195]  It's obviously not going to work.
[03:03:33.195 --> 03:03:38.197]  People are either going to start fights, pick up a fuss, or just walk out the shop.
[03:03:38.197 --> 03:03:41.259]  Peter Cowgill, chairman of UK clothing outlet JD Sports,
[03:03:42.248 --> 03:03:48.653]  said that store employees shouldn't be expected to try to enforce the law and that the outcome would just be less people shopping.
[03:03:48.653 --> 03:03:53.077]  I'm not going in a shop if I have to wear a mask.
[03:03:53.077 --> 03:03:54.358]  That's the stupid thing about it.
[03:03:54.358 --> 03:04:06.087]  This doesn't apply to going into a restaurant, obviously because you've got to eat, or going into a pub, or going into a cinema, which is even more of a confined environment than going into a shop.
[03:04:06.087 --> 03:04:07.368]  It doesn't even make sense.
[03:04:09.093 --> 03:04:16.337]  It says, while health authorities have repeatedly insisted that wearing face masks helps stop the spread of COVID-19, the evidence is dubious at best.
[03:04:16.337 --> 03:04:29.065]  And I link to about 10 scientific investigations into the fact that wearing face masks, according to numerous studies, has no impact on the spread of the disease anyway.
[03:04:29.065 --> 03:04:34.308]  As I point out in this article, the WHO only advocated face masks after political lobbying
[03:04:35.089 --> 03:04:37.210]  Despite the science being unconvincing.
[03:04:37.210 --> 03:04:44.813]  They initially, the World Health Organization, studied the evidence and said there's no reason for everyone to be wearing face masks.
[03:04:44.813 --> 03:04:48.914]  They were lobbied politically and then it suddenly became mandatory.
[03:04:48.914 --> 03:05:00.138]  And in fact, BBC Newsnight admitted that when they reported, quote, The World Health Organization committee that reviewed the evidence for the use of face coverings in public didn't back them.
[03:05:00.138 --> 03:05:04.160]  The preeminent supposed experts, when they saw the scientific study, said,
[03:05:04.750 --> 03:05:12.432]  These face masks have no impact, but after political lobbying, the WHO now recommends them.
[03:05:12.432 --> 03:05:20.595]  And of course, everyone was wearing a face mask in Hubei province, right at the start of the outbreak in China.
[03:05:20.595 --> 03:05:24.716]  In Wuhan, in all those surrounding areas, didn't do them much good, did it?
[03:05:24.716 --> 03:05:28.517]  They were wearing the face masks before and during the outbreak.
[03:05:28.517 --> 03:05:31.238]  And as Toby Young explains on lockdownsceptics.org,
[03:05:32.526 --> 03:05:42.235]  Forcing people to wear face masks in shops will only deter more people from going shopping, further damaging any chance of a proper economic recovery.
[03:05:42.235 --> 03:05:52.745]  Which of course, when you've got a GDP that's been shaved off to the tune of 25% in this country, that causes poverty in the long term, that causes debt.
[03:05:52.745 --> 03:05:53.546]  He goes on to say,
[03:05:54.534 --> 03:06:05.142]  One of the most depressing things about this government's diktat is that it will mean people are even less likely to go shopping than they were when non-essential shops were allowed to reopen on July the 4th.
[03:06:05.142 --> 03:06:12.828]  Just looking at the high street as I was over the past few days, over this weekend, at least a quarter of the shops aren't even open anyway.
[03:06:12.828 --> 03:06:14.789]  A quarter of the pubs aren't coming back.
[03:06:14.789 --> 03:06:16.811]  Everything's been completely devastated.
[03:06:16.811 --> 03:06:23.536]  Instead of realising that, instead of realising that yes, we have immune systems, that yes, we have herd immunity,
[03:06:24.130 --> 03:06:28.792]  If it's allowed to process that way, that's how we get beyond this.
[03:06:28.792 --> 03:06:33.334]  We don't get beyond this by doubling down on mistake after mistake after mistake.
[03:06:33.334 --> 03:06:35.275]  We'll get more into it on the other side.
[03:06:35.275 --> 03:06:36.596]  Wrecking News at Summit.News.
[03:06:36.596 --> 03:06:37.456]  We'll be right back.
[03:06:44.525 --> 03:06:45.166]  I sure can, sir.
[03:06:45.166 --> 03:06:45.626]  Thank you.
[03:06:45.626 --> 03:06:46.247]  Hey, Alex.
[03:06:46.247 --> 03:06:52.472]  Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right now with you, man.
[03:06:52.472 --> 03:06:53.813]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[03:06:53.813 --> 03:06:57.957]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in.
[03:06:57.957 --> 03:07:02.060]  I'm a truck driver, and Turbo Force has changed the way I drive.
[03:07:02.060 --> 03:07:06.504]  Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple of us, we're all Hispanics.
[03:07:06.844 --> 03:07:13.130]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder there is.
[03:07:13.130 --> 03:07:16.294]  So this was designed by one of the top guys in the country.
[03:07:16.294 --> 03:07:17.195]  He didn't want his name on it.
[03:07:26.664 --> 03:07:27.944]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[03:07:27.944 --> 03:07:28.524]  Where did it come from?
[03:07:57.512 --> 03:07:59.693]  Infowarsstore.com.

[03:08:36.239 --> 03:08:42.945]  Other systems, just don't compare.
[03:08:42.945 --> 03:08:45.567]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:51.855 --> 03:09:02.697]  You're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:09:02.697 --> 03:09:08.119]  I see a lot of libertarians on Twitter and elsewhere every day saying, just wear the damn mask.
[03:09:08.119 --> 03:09:11.399]  You've already... I mean, what level is that going to get to?
[03:09:11.399 --> 03:09:13.400]  Just take the damn vaccine.
[03:09:13.400 --> 03:09:15.240]  Just take the damn chip.
[03:09:15.240 --> 03:09:18.121]  You've already sacrificed so many liberties at the drop of a hat.
[03:09:19.224 --> 03:09:28.248]  In terms of freedom of movement, freedom of assembly, in terms of freedom of speech, not being allowed to criticise the much vaunted health authorities.
[03:09:28.248 --> 03:09:30.869]  And now we're muzzling ourselves, and this is the thing.
[03:09:31.892 --> 03:09:43.875]  Everywhere I go, if these masks are supposedly so important to prevent infections, while everyone's touching them and then touching all these different surfaces, why are they on the floor everywhere?
[03:09:43.875 --> 03:09:49.917]  Why do I see masks littering the streets, littering the parks, littering the shops?
[03:09:49.917 --> 03:09:56.259]  I went in this restaurant, there were masks inside the restaurant just on the floor, people just dumping them everywhere.
[03:09:56.259 --> 03:09:57.479]  If they're so infectious,
[03:09:58.297 --> 03:10:02.641]  If you need to be so careful about this whole mass situation, why are you throwing them on the floor?
[03:10:02.641 --> 03:10:05.865]  Inside buildings, not even out on the street.
[03:10:05.865 --> 03:10:09.989]  The park is littered with them.
[03:10:09.989 --> 03:10:18.057]  Now they're going to be mandatory, because Boris Johnson is a complete idiot who's caved to the most alarmist, hysterical morons who are never going to vote for him.
[03:10:19.116 --> 03:10:23.757]  Pretty funny how Boris Johnson, supposedly like Trump, we had some of the same hysteria.
[03:10:23.757 --> 03:10:30.359]  You know, Boris Derangement Syndrome is supposedly this right-wing fascist about to institute authoritarianism.
[03:10:30.359 --> 03:10:36.982]  Yet when he does institute some aspects of at least low-level authoritarianism, his enemies all love it!
[03:10:36.982 --> 03:10:38.102]  They all support it!
[03:10:38.102 --> 03:10:42.503]  The polls show that 80% plus of people support this.
[03:10:42.503 --> 03:10:45.564]  Meanwhile, half of them aren't even back at work yet.
[03:10:45.564 --> 03:10:48.165]  They're still getting paid by the government until October.
[03:10:49.286 --> 03:10:53.107]  A lot of those are public employees, so they know they've got a job to go back to.
[03:10:53.107 --> 03:10:57.708]  Meanwhile, people in the private sector are completely screwed.
[03:10:57.708 --> 03:11:03.189]  And Boris Johnson's exacerbating that by reintroducing all these lockdown measures.
[03:11:03.189 --> 03:11:10.731]  There's an excellent article about this, which I'm going to try and get through most of it now, that's spiked online by Brendan O'Neill.
[03:11:10.731 --> 03:11:14.812]  It's called, Muzzling the Public, Why I'm Against Mandatory Mask Wearing.
[03:11:15.925 --> 03:11:19.627]  He makes the point that this is about separating people into different classes.
[03:11:19.627 --> 03:11:24.210]  In America, deplorable Trump supporters and leftists, Democrats.
[03:11:24.210 --> 03:11:29.533]  And in the UK, Corbynista left-wing types and bigoted racist Brexit supporters.
[03:11:29.533 --> 03:11:40.380]  He says in his article, Here come the sneerers, their target this time, anyone who expresses even a tiny amount of scepticism about mandatory mask wearing in shops.
[03:11:41.027 --> 03:11:46.629]  Within hours, mask skeptics have become the new climate change deniers.
[03:11:46.629 --> 03:11:49.071]  Yes, they're going to stick that one on us as well.
[03:11:49.071 --> 03:11:50.831]  They're going to say that we're killing granny.
[03:11:50.831 --> 03:11:53.212]  Oh, you can have 50,000 people for a BLM protest.
[03:11:53.212 --> 03:11:54.953]  Oh, that's fine.
[03:11:54.953 --> 03:11:55.934]  They're granny killers.
[03:11:55.934 --> 03:11:57.974]  They're sociopaths.
[03:11:57.974 --> 03:12:06.018]  They're the kind of people who care more for their right to breathe all over the fruit and veg than they do the continued existence of people over the age of 75.
[03:12:06.018 --> 03:12:10.460]  The speed with which mask skepticism has been turned into a foul blasphemy.
[03:12:11.829 --> 03:12:21.317]  The only thick people who probably voted for Brexit would ever engage in confirms that this latest manifestation of the culture wars has very little to do with masks.
[03:12:21.317 --> 03:12:22.998]  That's exactly the point.
[03:12:22.998 --> 03:12:38.952]  Just like Covid, the mask has been vehemently politicised, which is why you see all these videos on Twitter of people being doxxed, harassed, publicly humiliated, with the videos posted of them daring to dissent against the high priest class of mask wearers.
[03:12:41.181 --> 03:12:41.842]  He goes on to say,
[03:12:55.222 --> 03:13:10.433]  To take £100 off someone who dares to show his face in public, like a politer public health version of the morality guards in Afghanistan who would whip women with a stick if they ever committed the crime of unmasking their face in public.
[03:13:10.433 --> 03:13:12.954]  I mean, is it going to get that bad?
[03:13:12.954 --> 03:13:22.101]  You've seen the roaming religious police vans in countries like Iran smacking people with canes and whips for letting their burka slip.
[03:13:22.101 --> 03:13:23.782]  Are we going to get a similar thing over here?
[03:13:24.761 --> 03:13:28.646]  Apparently that's libertarian now, according to a lot of so-called libertarians.
[03:13:28.646 --> 03:13:30.508]  It's apparently not.
[03:13:30.508 --> 03:13:36.456]  Apparently you would have to be a Cove idiot, a mad libertarian, to want to discuss the latest development.
[03:13:36.456 --> 03:13:42.303]  The right thing to do is vigorously nod your head in agreement with the Tory government, don your mask and muzzle your opinions.
[03:13:43.286 --> 03:13:59.113]  And now he makes the point about the authoritarianism, which they're apparently keen on embracing, despite the fact that seven months ago they were all telling us that Boris Johnson was an authoritarian dictator that was going to impose a totalitarian system of government.
[03:13:59.113 --> 03:14:01.074]  Now he's doing that, at least on the low level.
[03:14:01.074 --> 03:14:02.635]  They all love it!
[03:14:02.635 --> 03:14:10.378]  He says it's remarkable that it's always the people who spent the past year or so telling us that Boris and his crew were fascists who have unquestionably embraced
[03:14:11.144 --> 03:14:16.507]  Every COVID-related dick tat issued by Boris's government.
[03:14:16.507 --> 03:14:18.048]  Stay in our homes for three months.
[03:14:18.048 --> 03:14:18.908]  You got it.
[03:14:18.908 --> 03:14:21.510]  Don't engage in sexual relations with people we don't live with.
[03:14:21.510 --> 03:14:22.430]  Sure thing.
[03:14:22.430 --> 03:14:23.751]  Wear a mask in public.
[03:14:23.751 --> 03:14:24.931]  Yes sir.
[03:14:24.931 --> 03:14:29.754]  The most fanatical lockdown lovers tend to be found amongst the millennial left.
[03:14:29.754 --> 03:14:33.156]  In Corbyn Easter circles, in the pages of Liberal broadsheets,
[03:14:33.846 --> 03:14:45.992]  And, of course, among public sector workers who know they'll have a job at the end of all this, unlike many private sector workers who are completely screwed because a quarter of the shops on the high street are shutting down.
[03:14:45.992 --> 03:14:50.954]  So, it isn't surprising that these masochistic middle classes are now fuming against mask sceptics.
[03:14:50.954 --> 03:14:54.456]  Do as you're told, they're essentially saying.
[03:14:54.456 --> 03:14:55.716]  And they're saying it in person.
[03:14:55.716 --> 03:14:58.478]  They get very angry if you try to get past them in restaurants.
[03:14:58.478 --> 03:15:01.219]  They scream in your face because now they have the power
[03:15:02.350 --> 03:15:08.996]  Also I've noticed that the people who wear the masks are the most likely to get as close to you as possible.
[03:15:08.996 --> 03:15:10.757]  Because again, you're not in the cult.
[03:15:10.757 --> 03:15:11.618]  They're in the cult.
[03:15:11.618 --> 03:15:12.999]  They can do what they want.
[03:15:12.999 --> 03:15:17.162]  They can violate social distancing to the nth degree.
[03:15:17.162 --> 03:15:21.786]  If you put a foot wrong though, they'll get in your face.
[03:15:21.786 --> 03:15:22.567]  He goes on to say...
[03:15:23.945 --> 03:15:28.269]  The clampdown on mass scepticism is motored by the usual hatreds of the culture war.
[03:15:28.269 --> 03:15:38.400]  Witness James O'Brien, LBC's privately educated mocker of the dim masses, putting out a video in which he discusses the possibility that anti-mask people are Brexit voters.
[03:15:39.341 --> 03:15:41.623]  That's how it's politicised.
[03:15:41.623 --> 03:15:44.704]  Of course they are, the thick SHITs.
[03:15:44.704 --> 03:15:48.887]  The snobs even have a study now to confirm their prejudices against mass sceptics.
[03:15:48.887 --> 03:15:56.532]  Daily Mail reports that researchers in the US have found that people who refuse to wear a mask or comply with social distancing have lower cognitive ability.
[03:15:56.532 --> 03:15:59.774]  Real Cove idiots, as the Mail sums them up.
[03:15:59.774 --> 03:16:07.579]  So again, it's about differentiating between the deplorables, between the bigots, between the racists, and the good people.
[03:16:08.214 --> 03:16:12.758]  who do exactly as they're told and wear the masks.
[03:16:12.758 --> 03:16:24.968]  He says, in certain circles, mask wearing will become a form of distinction, a way of distinguishing yourself from brainwashed cretins and showing you're a good person.
[03:16:24.968 --> 03:16:30.533]  Again, the kind of hateful idiots who will scream in your face while claiming to be good people.
[03:16:30.533 --> 03:16:36.418]  Masks will become moral garments, public demonstrations of decency not unlike in Afghanistan.
[03:16:37.509 --> 03:16:41.273]  He says we cannot let mask-wearing become the new normal.
[03:16:41.273 --> 03:16:42.634]  Masks are horrible!
[03:16:42.634 --> 03:16:50.723]  They're stuffy and claustrophobic, they make it hard to read people's faces, they alienate us from each other even more, hiding smiles and discouraging chit-chat.
[03:16:50.723 --> 03:16:58.771]  And they actually worsen the culture of fear by spreading the idea that our fellow citizens are walking diseases who must be muzzled and kept at a safe distance.
[03:16:59.660 --> 03:17:09.586]  Only people comfortable with the contemporary social atomization that has been intensified by the lockdown would embrace mandatory mask wearing with no questions whatsoever.
[03:17:09.586 --> 03:17:12.448]  Some of us dislike atomization.
[03:17:12.448 --> 03:17:17.872]  We want connection, community, engagement and so we believe that mask wearing should be voluntary.
[03:17:17.872 --> 03:17:20.273]  Are we allowed to say that?
[03:17:20.273 --> 03:17:21.094]  Well apparently not.
[03:17:22.128 --> 03:17:35.406]  Because as we've seen over the past few months, disagreeing with the health authorities will get you censured in polite circles, it will get you banned on social media, again, because we can't question the same people who got most of this wrong from the very beginning.
[03:17:35.406 --> 03:17:37.028]  Don't go away, we'll be right back.
[03:17:37.629 --> 03:17:53.021]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years, and if you go back to those shows, we laid out the AI takeover plan, the tracking of cell phones, how programmed master computers would manipulate control society, how they'd be able to not just predict,
[03:17:53.641 --> 03:17:54.241]  I think so.
[03:18:13.573 --> 03:18:17.555]  But when we cover that, the media would attack us and say we were making it up.
[03:18:17.555 --> 03:18:22.797]  It was a conspiracy theory, even though it was in the actual corporate-level blueprint documents.
[03:18:22.797 --> 03:18:31.080]  Well, the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out.
[03:18:31.080 --> 03:18:34.481]  And it's something about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned.
[03:18:34.481 --> 03:18:36.542]  So we might want to dismantle the system now.
[03:18:37.242 --> 03:18:44.747]  One of our best-selling products is Living Defense, and it's been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic.
[03:18:44.747 --> 03:18:50.931]  We've got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast, and I want those of you that haven't experienced Living Defense to get it for yourself.
[03:18:50.931 --> 03:18:52.392]  Here's just part of one testimonial.
[03:18:52.612 --> 03:18:55.256]  Look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital.
[03:18:55.256 --> 03:18:58.780]  I went in a VA hospital out here in Boise, and I was in there until June.
[03:18:58.780 --> 03:19:08.052]  And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to InfoWars three hours a day, and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[03:19:08.052 --> 03:19:08.933]  Let me tell you something, man.
[03:19:09.093 --> 03:19:15.897]  I had an internal digestive problem and I suffered with it for about five or six years and the doctors, they tried every test.
[03:19:15.897 --> 03:19:17.377]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[03:19:17.377 --> 03:19:21.380]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what?
[03:19:21.380 --> 03:19:23.561]  I'm going to get me some of that freaking Living Defense.
[03:19:23.561 --> 03:19:28.443]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have that stuff, but I ordered it, had it shipped to me.
[03:19:28.443 --> 03:19:28.984]  I got it.
[03:19:28.984 --> 03:19:30.224]  I hid it from the nurses.
[03:19:30.224 --> 03:19:31.245]  I started taking it.
[03:19:31.245 --> 03:19:33.306]  Man, that stuff changed my life.
[03:19:33.306 --> 03:19:34.246]  It saved my life.
[03:19:34.246 --> 03:19:36.948]  Alex Jones and InfoWars saved my life.
[03:19:37.415 --> 03:19:41.517]  There are three reasons that the globalists launch this planetary lockdown.
[03:19:41.517 --> 03:19:45.680]  The number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes.
[03:19:45.680 --> 03:19:50.163]  We've gone over those purposes many times here on air.
[03:19:50.163 --> 03:19:56.226]  The cashless society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, forced inoculation.
[03:19:56.226 --> 03:20:04.071]  But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential as we begin to
[03:20:04.932 --> 03:20:12.455]  Witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had by design.
[03:20:12.455 --> 03:20:16.517]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[03:20:16.517 --> 03:20:21.899]  It's been pre-planned, organized globally, and it's extremely predatory.
[03:20:21.899 --> 03:20:33.103]  And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[03:20:33.692 --> 03:20:40.035]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[03:20:40.035 --> 03:20:53.323]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:53.323 --> 03:21:01.207]  Live from the Summit.News headquarters, it's Paul Joseph Watson
[03:21:04.511 --> 03:21:13.857]  Now we're going to get into a Tucker Carlson video where he's talking about the attack on religious icons in the aftermath of these BLM riots.
[03:21:13.857 --> 03:21:27.225]  Finishing off on that mass point though, a lot of people have expressed the opinion that this is a measure introduced by Boris Johnson to give people more confidence to go out into the streets, more confidence to go into shops and spend their money.
[03:21:27.225 --> 03:21:33.389]  But from everything I've read from the commentary that's arrived in the aftermath of this new law being introduced, it's going to have the opposite effect.
[03:21:34.031 --> 03:21:43.961]  It's going to make people less likely to want to go out, given that they're being forced not just to wear the mask, but to go through all this rigmarole merely to get into a shop.
[03:21:43.961 --> 03:21:49.666]  In fact, there's an article on Sputnik called Masks Are All About The Economy Not Safety, where the author writes,
[03:21:52.975 --> 03:21:59.981]  Now people are very concerned about going out again, which is why pubs are not being besieged and are operating on at least 50% lower takings.
[03:21:59.981 --> 03:22:02.063]  The same is happening on the high street.
[03:22:02.063 --> 03:22:14.214]  Why would you go shopping in town when you have to queue to get into every shop and you're treated like a leper by an assistant in a mask asking if you've hand sanitized?
[03:22:14.214 --> 03:22:16.436]  And now these assistants are going to be empowered with
[03:22:17.617 --> 03:22:21.060]  Basically, de facto police powers to detain people.
[03:22:21.060 --> 03:22:24.564]  It's going to be a complete disaster, but that's what the bosses are probably going to tell them to do.
[03:22:24.564 --> 03:22:38.918]  We've seen the videos out of Walmart, out of Target in America, where these Karens who run the place, the staff members, not only try to detain but try to publicly humiliate and harass people who dare not wear a mask.
[03:22:38.918 --> 03:22:42.261]  He continues to say then you can't touch the clothes or even try the shoes on.
[03:22:42.970 --> 03:22:43.551]  That's right.
[03:22:43.551 --> 03:22:46.735]  You go clothes shopping, you're not even allowed to touch the clothes.
[03:22:46.735 --> 03:22:47.676]  What's the point?
[03:22:47.676 --> 03:22:48.618]  You're just not gonna go.
[03:22:48.618 --> 03:22:51.802]  You're just gonna go online.
[03:22:51.802 --> 03:22:52.303]  If that.
[03:22:53.686 --> 03:22:59.552]  He says, no wonder people are practicing real social distancing and shopping from the safety of their own homes via the internet.
[03:22:59.552 --> 03:23:08.080]  The high street and town centres were already dying before Covid, but Boris's mandatory face mask law will be the final death blow for our town centres.
[03:23:08.080 --> 03:23:10.162]  It will have the opposite effect to the one he intends.
[03:23:10.162 --> 03:23:13.725]  The shoppers will stay away.
[03:23:13.725 --> 03:23:16.788]  Now I've ranted about that for about 35 minutes, so we're going to move on.
[03:23:16.788 --> 03:23:17.809]  Fox News reports.
[03:23:18.809 --> 03:23:24.501]  Catholic churches burned, vandalized over the weekend, as police investigate, where's the outrage?
[03:23:24.501 --> 03:23:27.427]  And this was the subject of Tucker Carlson's interview last night.
[03:23:27.427 --> 03:23:29.331]  We're going to roll that clip right now.
[03:23:29.331 --> 03:23:29.732]  Here it is.
[03:23:30.848 --> 03:23:36.052]  Well, the mob has turned its focus from American history to Christianity.
[03:23:36.052 --> 03:23:41.196]  Over the weekend, vandals in Boston torched a statue of the Virgin Mary outside a church.
[03:23:41.196 --> 03:23:45.319]  In New York, they defaced a statue of the Virgin Mary in front of a Catholic school.
[03:23:45.319 --> 03:23:49.743]  In Florida, a man drove his car into a church as he was preparing for Sunday Mass.
[03:23:49.743 --> 03:23:53.246]  He then dumped gasoline in the entryway and set the building on fire.
[03:23:53.706 --> 03:24:01.453]  In the state of California, a historic church was destroyed completely by flames as it prepared to celebrate its 250th anniversary.
[03:24:01.453 --> 03:24:07.779]  Local fire departments suggested it may have had something to do with outrage from the mob directed at Junipero Serra.
[03:24:07.779 --> 03:24:10.081]  That was the founder of California's mission system.
[03:24:10.902 --> 03:24:18.405]  As churches burned and statues were defaced, former Democratic Party leader Howard Dean, maybe the dumbest person ever to run the DNC, tweeted this.
[03:24:29.696 --> 03:24:31.056]  Eric Pataxas is a Christian.
[03:24:31.056 --> 03:24:38.958]  He's the author of the book, If You Can Keep It, The Forgotten Promise of American Liberty, and also of maybe the single best biography of Martin Luther.
[03:24:38.958 --> 03:24:39.678]  He joins us tonight.
[03:24:39.678 --> 03:24:41.539]  Eric, thanks so much for coming on.
[03:24:41.539 --> 03:24:49.161]  So, here you have the former head of the DNC attacking Christianity as a religion of hate and its disciples as haters.
[03:24:49.161 --> 03:24:53.282]  Imagine Howard Dean saying that about any other religion.
[03:24:53.282 --> 03:24:54.822]  What would the response be, do you think?
[03:24:54.822 --> 03:24:57.463]  Listen, you've got to give Howard Dean a pass.
[03:24:57.463 --> 03:24:58.383]  He's a jughead.
[03:24:58.983 --> 03:25:01.665]  You cannot take him seriously.
[03:25:01.665 --> 03:25:02.966]  Here's the issue.
[03:25:02.966 --> 03:25:12.332]  When you start to scapegoat Christians and you say it's because of them that these things are happening, unfortunately you fall into the trap of being like the Emperor Nero.
[03:25:12.332 --> 03:25:19.737]  When Rome burned, and of course he could have done something about it and he didn't, he blamed the Christians.
[03:25:19.737 --> 03:25:21.959]  It's very convenient.
[03:25:21.959 --> 03:25:22.919]  It's happening now.
[03:25:22.919 --> 03:25:26.482]  I think a lot of the nastiness that is being directed at
[03:25:27.202 --> 03:25:33.508]  These statues, it really has to do with something deeper, Tucker.
[03:25:33.508 --> 03:25:36.550]  I hate to say it, but there's something very dark.
[03:25:36.550 --> 03:25:38.572]  You saw this in the French Revolution.
[03:25:38.572 --> 03:25:44.757]  There was a hatred at the bottom of it of God, of any kind of authority.
[03:25:44.757 --> 03:25:52.744]  And these people are drunk with the idea that they can, you know, somehow be an authority themselves, that they can seize power.
[03:25:52.744 --> 03:25:54.566]  And if you really want to cut to the chase,
[03:25:55.226 --> 03:25:58.050]  You forget about statues of generals and things.
[03:25:58.050 --> 03:26:00.453]  You go right for God.
[03:26:00.453 --> 03:26:03.737]  You go right for the Virgin Mary.
[03:26:03.737 --> 03:26:06.721]  My goodness, you go for churches.
[03:26:06.721 --> 03:26:08.564]  You cut to the chase.
[03:26:08.564 --> 03:26:13.090]  Someplace in Moby Dick, one of the greatest novels ever written by a great American,
[03:26:14.010 --> 03:26:20.595]  He talks about Ahab, who's consumed with rage, wanting to strike through the mask.
[03:26:20.595 --> 03:26:24.698]  In other words, sort of to punch a hole in the sky and murder God.
[03:26:24.698 --> 03:26:27.961]  That's really where the source of hatred is coming from.
[03:26:27.961 --> 03:26:31.784]  It's a hatred of God and a sense of deep injustice.
[03:26:31.784 --> 03:26:33.525]  That's what we're talking about here.
[03:26:33.525 --> 03:26:37.348]  We're talking about something that goes way beyond Confederate generals.
[03:26:38.348 --> 03:26:39.709]  I think you're right.
[03:26:39.709 --> 03:26:43.731]  The acknowledgment of God suggests that you're not the ultimate authority.
[03:26:43.731 --> 03:26:46.172]  That there's someone more powerful than you and our leaders can't stand it.
[03:26:46.172 --> 03:26:49.134]  I do think, though, that Christian leaders play a role in this.
[03:26:49.134 --> 03:27:02.140]  I mean, Muslim leaders, to their credit, if they watched mosques burn and Islamic monuments be defaced, the Islamic Center in Washington, they would not put up with it for one second.
[03:27:02.140 --> 03:27:03.181]  They would say something.
[03:27:03.181 --> 03:27:05.562]  I don't see Christian leaders doing the same and I don't know why.
[03:27:06.417 --> 03:27:07.678]  Well, I'll tell you why.
[03:27:07.678 --> 03:27:11.602]  There are many Christian leaders who don't understand the Bible.
[03:27:11.602 --> 03:27:17.988]  When David killed Goliath, it wasn't like before he became a Christian and then he became a Christian and he repented.
[03:27:17.988 --> 03:27:18.549]  No.
[03:27:18.549 --> 03:27:22.593]  We celebrate David killing Goliath.
[03:27:22.593 --> 03:27:26.717]  There are many instances of scripture where people fight.
[03:27:26.717 --> 03:27:28.899]  Elijah the prophet is sarcastic.
[03:27:29.777 --> 03:27:31.698]  That has been lost.
[03:27:31.698 --> 03:27:35.999]  There are many people, they've got a watered down kind of Christianity.
[03:27:35.999 --> 03:27:37.879]  They're offended by Trump.
[03:27:37.879 --> 03:27:42.881]  They seem to think that being nice is what it means to be a Christian.
[03:27:42.881 --> 03:27:50.943]  Well, if someone is raping a family member and you sit there and you say, well, I'm going to pray about it, but I'm not going to try to stop that.
[03:27:51.563 --> 03:27:53.185]  It brings us really to Bonhoeffer.
[03:27:53.185 --> 03:28:01.955]  Bonhoeffer understood that the most Christian thing he could do was participate in a plot to kill Hitler because he understood there were victims.
[03:28:01.955 --> 03:28:07.242]  When you know that there are people suffering, if you don't do something about it, you are to blame.
[03:28:07.242 --> 03:28:10.065]  And actually, interestingly, when Kristallnacht happened,
[03:28:10.545 --> 03:28:11.306]  We're good to go.
[03:28:25.943 --> 03:28:29.444]  It was an attack on God Himself.
[03:28:29.444 --> 03:28:36.807]  There's a rage and a sense of envy that, you know, I don't like to use the word too lightly, but there's something satanic about it.
[03:28:36.807 --> 03:28:42.228]  There's something about it that is an unbridled, roaring fury.
[03:28:42.228 --> 03:28:50.371]  And if you don't treat it in the way that it needs to be treated, if you don't deal with it with some force,
[03:28:51.091 --> 03:29:19.254]  Really, then, you are allowing other people to be harmed, and any Christian leader who doesn't understand that this is a Marxist, violent organization, this has nothing to do anymore with George Floyd, and with that they've hijacked this, and everything they want to do, they want to burn down everything that has been built by good people over centuries, most of whom, of course, were Christians.
[03:29:20.481 --> 03:29:25.564]  You have a right, and we need to preserve the right, to live in this country as a faithful Christian, period.
[03:29:25.564 --> 03:29:27.105]  And our leaders should help, I think.
[03:29:27.105 --> 03:29:29.566]  Eric from Texas, thank you for that analysis.
[03:29:29.566 --> 03:29:32.228]  Always good to see you, thank you.
[03:29:32.228 --> 03:29:36.230]  Now, sticking with the subject of Black Lives Matter, we had this headline last night.
[03:29:36.230 --> 03:29:40.633]  BLM supporters celebrate death of mother shot dead for saying all lives matter.
[03:29:40.633 --> 03:29:44.495]  A story, by the way, that initially the mainstream media refused to pick up on.
[03:29:44.495 --> 03:29:48.037]  They only picked up on it when they tried to create a justification
[03:29:48.852 --> 03:29:53.276]  This horrific murder by claiming that one of this mother's friends had used the n-word.
[03:29:53.276 --> 03:30:01.242]  There was a confrontation in Indianapolis after a 4th of July celebration with this young mother, her fiancé, and her two friends.
[03:30:01.242 --> 03:30:09.649]  During the confrontation, Whittaker, the woman, said, all lives matter, prompting the BLM supporters to draw weapons, after which Whittaker's fiancé drew his weapon.
[03:30:09.649 --> 03:30:13.271]  She was shot dead for the crime of saying all lives matter.
[03:30:13.271 --> 03:30:14.973]  If that had happened the other way around,
[03:30:15.993 --> 03:30:19.837]  You know, so-called white supremacists shooting Black Lives Matter supporters.
[03:30:19.837 --> 03:30:23.000]  It would be a national news story for weeks, if not months.
[03:30:23.000 --> 03:30:24.801]  This one's already disappeared.
[03:30:24.801 --> 03:30:32.789]  Just to top it all off, Black Lives Matter supporters have now crashed the Facebook page of this murder victim and are insulting, mocking her and her family.
[03:30:32.789 --> 03:30:34.871]  Because again, they're good people.
[03:30:34.871 --> 03:30:35.952]  Don't go away, we'll be right back.
[03:30:36.272 --> 03:30:46.579]  The bad news is Western governments have totally let multinational big tech bring in communist Chinese style total net surveillance censorship with AI.
[03:30:46.579 --> 03:30:51.303]  The good news is they had to do that to carry out this world government COVID takeover.
[03:30:51.983 --> 03:31:00.346]  This planetary corporate reset that COVID covers for, because the truth is powerful and will defeat them and will smash them.
[03:31:00.346 --> 03:31:20.214]  And the good news is there's still sites like band.video, newswars.com, infowars.com, paulwatsonsite, summit.news, and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive traffic thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen, that is the master of our own
[03:31:20.874 --> 03:31:21.894]  Destinies.
[03:31:21.894 --> 03:31:28.837]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality, a war on civilization, a war on our health, a war on our economy.
[03:31:28.837 --> 03:31:33.339]  But being aware of it, and standing up to it, and speaking out against it, will defeat it.
[03:31:33.339 --> 03:31:35.420]  So take action, or be slaves!
[03:31:38.137 --> 03:31:40.698]  Available for shipping within three to four weeks.
[03:31:40.698 --> 03:31:41.319]  We have it.
[03:31:41.319 --> 03:31:44.800]  It's high quality, but it's got to be packaged and shipped out to you.
[03:31:44.800 --> 03:31:47.041]  Some items are shipping in a week, some in four weeks.
[03:31:47.041 --> 03:31:48.702]  So they're saying three to four weeks.
[03:31:48.702 --> 03:31:49.762]  It's my Patriot.
[03:31:49.762 --> 03:31:50.823]  We have their full catalog.

[03:32:11.875 --> 03:32:15.077]  This is one of the big boxes you've got to get checked off.

[03:33:37.267 --> 03:33:43.912]  Much of the United States bureaucracy, all of Hollywood, and most of our media is under international banking control.
[03:33:43.912 --> 03:33:49.196]  The United Nations was set up by the Rothschilds and Rockefellers on record to carry out this operation.
[03:33:49.196 --> 03:33:54.239]  Now, under the guise of medical security, they're bringing us medical tyranny.
[03:33:55.060 --> 03:34:07.447]  That we see much of the federal government, the Democrats, the Republicans, all saying, except for Trump and a few people, that we need a nationwide force mask mandate to make everyone wear a mask.
[03:34:07.447 --> 03:34:12.169]  Even though just months ago we had the Surgeon General and others say, don't wear a mask, it's all a fraud.
[03:34:12.169 --> 03:34:14.671]  Now they say you must wear a mask.
[03:34:14.671 --> 03:34:16.251]  It's a sign of slavery.
[03:34:16.251 --> 03:34:17.292]  It's a sign of submission.
[03:34:17.292 --> 03:34:18.773]  I know you as listeners understand that.
[03:34:19.273 --> 03:34:30.556]  We need sheriffs and county commissioners and city councils and others to stand up and say we are sanctuary cities for reality and for state and local sovereignty against the globalists.
[03:34:30.556 --> 03:34:40.079]  This isn't the federal government taking over, it's the UN through the federal government and we as American citizens must say no.
[03:34:40.079 --> 03:34:42.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:34:52.463 --> 03:35:01.046]  Broadcasting internationally from the Summit.News headquarters in the United Kingdom, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:35:01.046 --> 03:35:14.150]  Let me get into some more BLM news here in a second, but first I want to tell you about the great Christmas in July sale which is available right now at infowarsstore.com.
[03:35:14.150 --> 03:35:18.551]  Part of this sale is at High Quality Storable Foods because if we're going to get screeched at by

[03:35:24.979 --> 03:35:32.264]  Maybe it's a good idea to start ordering your food online, where we have high quality storable food at 25 years shelf life.
[03:35:32.264 --> 03:35:34.846]  Amazing product, save big on that.

[03:35:54.538 --> 03:35:58.320]  Go and read the raft of five star reviews on all these products.
[03:35:58.320 --> 03:36:02.442]  We've also got the new Betsy Ross American Eagle T-shirt.
[03:36:03.200 --> 03:36:05.081]  Two designs actually, two different designs.
[03:36:05.081 --> 03:36:07.223]  That looks absolutely brilliant.
[03:36:07.223 --> 03:36:08.343]  Go and check that out.
[03:36:08.343 --> 03:36:17.249]  That's also available at discount with all the other great products at infowarsstore.com as part of the Christmas in July sale.
[03:36:17.249 --> 03:36:23.173]  Please support this network today, infowarsstore.com.
[03:36:23.173 --> 03:36:30.178]  I talked about the young mother who was shot in the head for saying All Lives Matter back on July the 4th.
[03:36:30.178 --> 03:36:31.999]  You would think the media would be interested in that.
[03:36:32.887 --> 03:36:34.448]  Didn't really turn out to be the case.
[03:36:34.448 --> 03:36:39.750]  They dropped it like a hot potato after a couple of days because the narrative didn't fit.
[03:36:39.750 --> 03:36:41.871]  Then a bunch of BLM supporters.
[03:36:41.871 --> 03:36:45.673]  And by the way, I've had death threats from feminists.
[03:36:45.673 --> 03:36:49.934]  I've had death threats from Islamic extremists over the years.
[03:36:49.934 --> 03:36:50.835]  Many death threats.
[03:36:50.835 --> 03:37:00.139]  Never did they ever come close to equaling the number of violent and death threats I've received from BLM supporters, who are obviously the nicest people.
[03:37:00.874 --> 03:37:11.542]  Because now they've raided the public Facebook page of Jessica Whittaker, the woman that was shot in the head in Indianapolis for saying why lives matter.
[03:37:11.542 --> 03:37:17.066]  One of them said, quote, racist Rachel is pushing daisies and the streets are a little safer.
[03:37:17.066 --> 03:37:21.890]  Another one said, can't feel bad when you used a racial slur and acted like an effing fool.
[03:37:21.890 --> 03:37:26.734]  So if you literally they're saying you deserve to be shot in the head,
[03:37:27.617 --> 03:37:32.199]  Your son deserves to grow up without a mother because you said all lives matter.
[03:37:32.199 --> 03:37:34.400]  These are the reasonable people.
[03:37:34.400 --> 03:37:39.462]  These are the people being given power by the cultural institutions that control our society.
[03:37:39.462 --> 03:37:40.862]  What could possibly go wrong?
[03:37:40.862 --> 03:37:45.084]  Another one said black lives matter, the rest of you are next.
[03:37:47.515 --> 03:37:54.559]  Another one said, Party for Safer Communities along with a gif image of Carlton from the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air dancing.
[03:37:54.559 --> 03:38:07.146]  They were literally posting celebration dancing gifs on the public Facebook page of a murder victim who was shot in the head for saying, for the crime of saying white lives matter.
[03:38:07.146 --> 03:38:09.147]  These are the kind of people we're dealing with.
[03:38:09.147 --> 03:38:15.431]  And these are the kind of people supported by virtually every major corporation in America, including the NBA.
[03:38:16.676 --> 03:38:23.760]  NBA Store refuses to sell free Hong Kong jersey, but does sell Kill Cop shirts.
[03:38:23.760 --> 03:38:25.061]  Now this came out last night.
[03:38:25.061 --> 03:38:33.566]  If you go on the NBA Store, you can choose the name which is used to emblazon your choice of NBA team jersey.
[03:38:34.679 --> 03:38:36.160]  And you can have it say, kill cops.
[03:38:36.160 --> 03:38:40.521]  You can have it say a number of other anti-cop messages, some of them violent.
[03:38:40.521 --> 03:38:45.843]  But if you try to put in, free Hong Kong, your order will be denied.
[03:38:45.843 --> 03:38:48.144]  And that was confirmed by nearest people.
[03:38:48.144 --> 03:38:53.186]  From what I saw last, they've removed the kill cops jersey.
[03:38:53.186 --> 03:38:58.768]  But right up until last night, that was perfectly acceptable according to the NBA.
[03:38:58.768 --> 03:39:00.429]  And of course this goes back to their tacit
[03:39:01.275 --> 03:39:15.824]  Support for the communist Chinese regime that has oppressed democracy activists since riots erupted last year, and of course recently passed the notorious National Security Law, which makes it easier for China to target and punish dissidents within Hong Kong.
[03:39:15.824 --> 03:39:18.285]  Of course, this all started with the NBA.
[03:39:18.285 --> 03:39:24.849]  As a result of Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeting in support of the Hong Kong protest movement,
[03:39:25.578 --> 03:39:32.523]  Which then prompted China to pull almost all sponsorship and NBA broadcasts, forcing the NBA into a grovelling apology.
[03:39:32.523 --> 03:39:41.610]  And then, of course, in the aftermath, whenever anyone tried to ask a question about it in NBA press conferences, they had their mics cut and they were immediately shut down.
[03:39:41.610 --> 03:39:53.899]  Oh, but the NBA's so woke, domestically, when it comes to a regime that literally puts Muslims in concentration camps and locks up protesters, not too concerned about that.
[03:39:54.602 --> 03:39:57.063]  Because they know where the money's coming from.
[03:39:57.063 --> 03:40:05.665]  Meanwhile, back in Clown World UK, UK police brag about arresting a 12-year-old boy for offensive social media posts.
[03:40:05.665 --> 03:40:17.669]  And of course, the entirety of the media, every cultural institution, and the multi-billion dollar industry that is the Premier League, all threw their support behind this multi-millionaire footballer.
[03:40:17.669 --> 03:40:20.670]  Meanwhile, the life of a 12-year-old boy is ruined forever.
[03:40:22.265 --> 03:40:24.326]  And he's the villain of the piece.
[03:40:24.326 --> 03:40:32.227]  UK police bragged about arresting a 12-year-old boy for offensive social media posts sent to a multi-millionaire Premier League footballer.
[03:40:32.227 --> 03:40:42.970]  The child was arrested after he sent racist messages to Wilfred Zoho telling the Crystal Palace star, you better not score tomorrow, you black C-U-N-T.
[03:40:42.970 --> 03:40:47.911]  So instead of ignoring this and realising that this was the stupid antics of a literal child,
[03:40:48.951 --> 03:40:57.553]  Mr. Zahrhart tweeted it out to his 800,000 Twitter followers, along with a screenshot of the child's Instagram page.
[03:40:57.553 --> 03:40:59.914]  No doubt he was immediately doxxed.
[03:40:59.914 --> 03:41:02.854]  No doubt his family's address was revealed.
[03:41:02.854 --> 03:41:05.835]  We know how this works by this point.
[03:41:05.835 --> 03:41:07.895]  But then the police bragged about it.
[03:41:07.895 --> 03:41:15.037]  West Midlands Police, by the way, which was part of the cover-up of some of the grooming gang scandal in the UK, not so concerned about that.
[03:41:15.037 --> 03:41:17.138]  A mean tweet by a 12-year-old, though.
[03:41:17.138 --> 03:41:18.238]  They were right on the case!
[03:41:20.856 --> 03:41:29.317]  They tweeted, We were alerted to a series of racist messages sent to a footballer today, and after looking into them and conducting checks, we have arrested a boy!
[03:41:29.317 --> 03:41:31.358]  They are proud!
[03:41:31.358 --> 03:41:35.379]  The 12-year-old from Solihull has been taken into custody, thanks to everyone who raised it.
[03:41:35.379 --> 03:41:38.999]  Racism will not be tolerated.
[03:41:38.999 --> 03:41:49.581]  So then people started to ask, why there are 43,000 extremists, most of them radical Islamists, on an MI5 terrorist watchlist, who are walking around free,
[03:41:50.433 --> 03:41:53.074]  And try to commit terror attacks on a routine basis.
[03:41:53.074 --> 03:41:55.075]  Thankfully most of them get stopped.
[03:41:55.075 --> 03:41:57.255]  Some of them don't.
[03:41:57.255 --> 03:41:58.036]  That's not important.
[03:41:58.036 --> 03:42:00.236]  A 12-year-old boy sending offensive messages.
[03:42:00.236 --> 03:42:03.617]  He was caught within 24 hours.
[03:42:03.617 --> 03:42:10.840]  Others chastise the same police force for failing to tackle far more serious crimes than a 12-year-old boy being offensive.
[03:42:10.840 --> 03:42:16.922]  And they point to the report about Asian grooming gangs which was suppressed by this same police department.
[03:42:18.689 --> 03:42:21.010]  Somebody else said, I wish you'd been so swift to act.
[03:42:21.010 --> 03:42:24.691]  When I was defrauded to the sum of thousands of pounds, I was told to go away.
[03:42:24.691 --> 03:42:28.292]  Again, across the UK, we're told on a routine basis.
[03:42:28.292 --> 03:42:30.553]  Oh, if you get burgled, sorry, that's not important.
[03:42:30.553 --> 03:42:32.933]  We're not even going to come out.
[03:42:32.933 --> 03:42:35.954]  Some kid says something edgy on the internet now.
[03:42:35.954 --> 03:42:38.975]  They crack down immediately.
[03:42:38.975 --> 03:42:45.817]  Somebody else said, in response to the tweet, I rang the police to report drug dealing taking place outside my house by students.
[03:42:45.817 --> 03:42:46.958]  They said, we're busy.
[03:42:46.958 --> 03:42:47.698]  Try the council.
[03:42:48.206 --> 03:42:52.687]  So actual crimes, not too enthusiastic about tackling them.
[03:42:52.687 --> 03:43:01.329]  12-year-old boy sends a mean tweet and they have their crack detectives on the case and he's arrested within hours.
[03:43:01.329 --> 03:43:09.651]  Of course, Ghislaine Maxwell is up on trial at the federal court hearing today for sex trafficking, alleged sex trafficking.
[03:43:09.651 --> 03:43:11.051]  And some of the same leftists who
[03:43:11.917 --> 03:43:15.899]  Maybe support the murder of that woman who said white lives matter.
[03:43:15.899 --> 03:43:22.283]  Also supported Ghislaine Maxwell as a feminist icon who could bring down Trump.
[03:43:22.283 --> 03:43:24.404]  Yes, this actually happened.
[03:43:24.404 --> 03:43:29.667]  Leftist celebrates Ghislaine Maxwell as a feminist icon who could bring down Trump.
[03:43:29.667 --> 03:43:35.730]  This was Hunter Cullen who lists his pronouns on his Twitter bio, no surprise there.
[03:43:35.730 --> 03:43:38.532]  Says he's a progressive, says he's a democrat, and he tweeted
[03:43:39.617 --> 03:43:41.399]  Tomorrow could get real ugly.
[03:43:41.399 --> 03:43:43.941]  Ghislaine Maxwell has her day in court.
[03:43:43.941 --> 03:43:49.165]  She could be the one that brings down Trump and the mob, unless it's the treason and the financials.
[03:43:49.165 --> 03:44:04.698]  He then appeared to attempt to portray Maxwell, an accused sex trafficker of dozens of girls, some of them minors, as being some kind of feminist icon by remarking, remember, it was always going to be a woman.
[03:44:04.698 --> 03:44:05.459]  Others jumped in.
[03:44:06.152 --> 03:44:12.474]  Saying, get it girl, while another shared a feminist meme accompanied with the words, we can do it.
[03:44:12.474 --> 03:44:20.257]  Of course they're not going to do it, because as we know from the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, Trump had nothing to do with it.
[03:44:20.257 --> 03:44:28.120]  They tried to put up that fake rape charge before the 2016 election, which came directly from a never-Trumper.
[03:44:28.120 --> 03:44:31.481]  That fell through the cracks because it was completely flimsy, non-existent.
[03:44:33.027 --> 03:44:45.454]  And as I point out in this article, while Donald Trump was once a personal friend of Jeffrey Epstein, he banned the billionaire paedophile from visiting Mar-a-Lago shortly after Epstein's 2008 conviction.
[03:44:45.454 --> 03:44:50.897]  Meanwhile, Kevin Spacey and the rest of them, Bill Clinton, are still hopping on the Lolita Express.
[03:44:50.897 --> 03:44:56.520]  Bill Gates is still investing hundreds of thousands of dollars into Jeffrey Epstein's projects.
[03:44:57.884 --> 03:45:04.406]  Whereas Trump, as soon as he found out, barred, banned Epstein from his Florida residence.
[03:45:04.406 --> 03:45:13.828]  And of course, Epstein victim, Virginia Roberts Guffrey, confirmed in unsealed court documents last year that she didn't witness Trump involved with any of the girls and women groomed by Epstein.
[03:45:13.828 --> 03:45:17.969]  She said, it's true that he didn't partake in any sex with us, but it's not true that he flirted with me.
[03:45:17.969 --> 03:45:19.910]  Donald Trump never flirted with me.
[03:45:19.910 --> 03:45:23.410]  Apparently, Ghislaine Maxwell is now a feminist icon.
[03:45:23.410 --> 03:45:24.211]  I'm just going to wrap it up.
[03:45:24.211 --> 03:45:25.191]  War Room next.
[03:45:25.191 --> 03:45:25.691]  Don't go away.
