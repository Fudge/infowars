[01:14.000 --> 01:18.000]  or 111 days down from the election I'm your host Alex Jones
[01:18.000 --> 01:22.000]  Roger Stone would have given us the exclusive
[01:22.000 --> 01:26.000]  yesterday as he promised me to do
[01:26.000 --> 01:30.000]  that he had to get clearance and had to get the clemency letter first
[01:30.000 --> 01:34.000]  and had to check with his probation officer so he gave it to
[01:34.000 --> 01:38.000]  Hannity that's fine I'm glad he's at least out there and able to speak
[01:38.000 --> 01:42.000]  in the so-called free country but he will be joining us in the second
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.000]  hour today and he has so many Skype problems
[01:46.000 --> 01:50.000]  at home in his apartment he's going to a law office of his lawyer to be able
[01:50.000 --> 01:54.000]  to do it and he's got a lot to cover so believe me you don't want to
[01:54.000 --> 01:58.000]  the second hour of the transmission today
[01:58.000 --> 02:02.000]  also Joe Hoff Jim Hoff's brother who lived in
[02:02.000 --> 02:06.000]  Hong Kong he's going to be back to the US to be joining us he's a
[02:06.000 --> 02:10.000]  statistician executive to go over the incredible numbers
[02:10.000 --> 02:14.000]  of the bait and switch shell game that is COVID-19
[02:14.000 --> 02:18.000]  now as I told you they were always planning lockdown 2.0 using fraudulent
[02:18.000 --> 02:22.000]  statistics and I told you California would lead the way locking down again
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  on it Austin will announce either today or tomorrow I have sources
[02:26.000 --> 02:30.000]  inside the APD and sources inside the city council
[02:30.000 --> 02:34.000]  they will announce lockdown as of yesterday
[02:34.000 --> 02:38.000]  either this afternoon or tomorrow that there was a
[02:38.000 --> 02:42.000]  debate whether it would be done Tuesday, Wednesday at the latest Friday
[02:42.000 --> 02:46.000]  but the mayor is set to pull the trigger because it's all WHO, UN
[02:46.000 --> 02:50.000]  directives for the NIH and I get all
[02:50.000 --> 02:54.000]  these emails from companies and from you know homeowners associations everything
[02:54.000 --> 02:58.000]  about how we follow the WHO guidelines why I just woke
[02:58.000 --> 03:02.000]  up and I'm under UN control so there's that incredible
[03:02.000 --> 03:06.000]  stack of news and developments remember a few months ago they
[03:06.000 --> 03:10.000]  had media matters articles that's run by George Soros and others
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.000]  saying it's preposterous George Soros doesn't fund BLM
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.000]  George Soros doesn't fund ANTIFA it's the same organization fighting fascism
[03:18.000 --> 03:22.000]  rise up all these groups Soros
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.000]  foundation refuse fascism announces it
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.000]  is doubling down on funding black led
[03:30.000 --> 03:34.000]  justice organizations that means the front for the looting the killing
[03:34.000 --> 03:38.000]  the murder what a true ghoul
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.000]  you know he could in that 1990s remake of Dracula he wouldn't need any
[03:42.000 --> 03:46.000]  make up to play the part of Dracula it looks just like the Dracula character that
[03:46.000 --> 03:50.000]  he's moving so that's all coming up today
[03:50.000 --> 03:54.000]  and more police officers executed more innocent white people executed
[03:54.000 --> 03:58.000]  and the media actually celebrates they're like kill that white bitch
[03:58.000 --> 04:02.000]  oh poor white people I mean this is true
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.000]  French Revolution insanity black cops
[04:06.000 --> 04:10.000]  are getting killed people are celebrating that I mean this is foreign governments
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  the bureaucrats the mega banks the establishment the man
[04:14.000 --> 04:18.000]  is trying to create a global depression and shut down America
[04:18.000 --> 04:22.000]  to punish us and they're bragging the establishment runs it
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.000]  all the media is behind it and the average meth head antifa person
[04:26.000 --> 04:30.000]  really believes they're out fighting for the people
[04:30.000 --> 04:34.000]  no they know they're green lit by the establishment
[04:34.000 --> 04:38.000]  and so all these cowards are getting together in gangs and attacking and going crazy

[06:18.000 --> 06:22.000]  a civil war between americans who are pro america pro freedom

[06:26.000 --> 06:30.000]  this is July 14th Tuesday Worldwide Transmission
[06:30.000 --> 06:34.000]  I am your host Alex Jones I'll be here for the next 4 hours live Paul Watson

[06:46.000 --> 06:50.000]  we have Jim Hof's brother who lived in Hong Kong and is an executive and
[06:50.000 --> 06:54.000]  looked at the numbers and write a bunch of big articles for Gateway Pundit he's going to be

[06:58.000 --> 07:02.000]  okay let's run over it lockdown 2.0 is here
[07:02.000 --> 07:06.000]  and the more you submit the more lockdowns come
[07:06.000 --> 07:10.000]  they were going to pull this whether Trump got elected or not this is a global government power move
[07:10.000 --> 07:14.000]  it's particularly nasty and political because of Trump
[07:14.000 --> 07:18.000]  but they were always planning to introduce the world social credit score
[07:18.000 --> 07:22.000]  tracking you in live time by law
[07:22.000 --> 07:26.000]  the United States using this
[07:26.000 --> 07:30.000]  and of course they've always dovetailed breaking western borders by saying any borders are racist
[07:30.000 --> 07:34.000]  you must let the UN direct whoever they want has been brainwashed into your country
[07:34.000 --> 07:38.000]  to be under UN globalist control
[07:38.000 --> 07:42.000]  that is the pincer attack of world government the global response to the virus they released
[07:42.000 --> 07:46.000]  that is the right pincer attack the left pincer attack
[07:46.000 --> 07:50.000]  Black Lives Matter and Antifa Worldwide all funded by George Soros
[07:50.000 --> 07:54.000]  and people see black leader statues being
[07:54.000 --> 07:58.000]  pulled down and anything old being pulled down
[07:58.000 --> 08:02.000]  you think that's because their followers are idiots well they are idiots but the globalists love seeing
[08:02.000 --> 08:06.000]  mindless servitude they love seeing Catholic churches burn
[08:06.000 --> 08:10.000]  all over the US last night Baptist churches burned the left
[08:10.000 --> 08:14.000]  knows what they're doing they're making their move now
[08:14.000 --> 08:18.000]  Antifa can march Black Lives Matter can march the gay
[08:18.000 --> 08:22.000]  groups can march but your church is going to burn
[08:22.000 --> 08:26.000]  and democrats from Michigan to California New York are going to tell you your church
[08:26.000 --> 08:30.000]  is not essential but BLM is
[08:30.000 --> 08:34.000]  Antifa is that's all coming up George Soros publicly brags he's
[08:34.000 --> 08:38.000]  fighting the groups after denying it four years
[08:38.000 --> 08:42.000]  he wants you to know just like what he went on for in Zakaria five years ago and said
[08:42.000 --> 08:48.000]  yes I funded with US money given to me five billion overthrow of Ukraine government
[08:48.000 --> 08:52.000]  I do it I do it to you
[08:52.000 --> 08:56.000]  then if you talk about it ADL comes out of the Southern Primary Law Center
[08:56.000 --> 09:00.000]  Media Matters the Joneses sing Soros over through Ukraine again
[09:00.000 --> 09:04.000]  you want me to play you a clip of them saying it
[09:04.000 --> 09:08.000]  how about Joe Biden coming up next segment
[09:08.000 --> 09:12.000]  Joe Biden came out and said that
[09:12.000 --> 09:16.000]  women hold up half the sky that's a Mao Zedong statement about
[09:16.000 --> 09:20.000]  we're going to make your women not raise the children where they want to be or run the farm
[09:20.000 --> 09:24.000]  we're going to make them work in a slave factory making American toys
[09:24.000 --> 09:28.000]  that's feminism with suicide nets and forced abortions it's so
[09:28.000 --> 09:32.000]  liberal he came out and said oh we need to be like China
[09:32.000 --> 09:36.000]  Mao Zedong and quoted Mao Zedong yesterday
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.000]  and we'll dovetail it with him a few years ago saying we need China
[09:40.000 --> 09:44.000]  and the Communist Party in every facet of our lives
[09:44.000 --> 09:48.000]  that's the model the communist Chinese people say how'd you know this
[09:48.000 --> 09:52.000]  20 years ago I'd read the council on farm relations
[09:52.000 --> 09:56.000]  foreign affairs where all the big groups of the bankers
[09:56.000 --> 10:00.000]  and the media academics and the banking heads and the governmental
[10:00.000 --> 10:04.000]  heads get together and they tell you
[10:04.000 --> 10:08.000]  what they're going to do
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.000]  and then they do it they said it'll be the end of America the Chinese
[10:12.000 --> 10:16.000]  century they'll be allowed to have families we won't
[10:16.000 --> 10:20.000]  we're going to sterilize the children making it trendy saying they're going to be transsexual
[10:20.000 --> 10:24.000]  and you read this stuff it's like how are they going to do that we're going to weather control
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.000]  spraying aluminum dioxide out with these radar dishes on the ground to create nuclei
[10:28.000 --> 10:32.000]  and control the weather I mean it's all public you know there it's like how they control the
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.000]  weather how they're going to chop your son's testicles off how they're going to promote pedophilia
[10:36.000 --> 10:40.000]  how they're going to end the family how they're going to pass regulations so you can't live in the rural
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.000]  areas or the suburbs and now it's all official
[10:44.000 --> 10:48.000]  and I know I tell you the stuff they're planning for years and show you the documents
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.000]  replacement migration 600 million people from the third world the next 20 years
[10:52.000 --> 10:56.000]  replace Americans and have an outside group to control us that's official UN website
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.000]  I mean this is what they're doing
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.000]  insane Hitler was crazy Stalin was crazy Mao was crazy
[11:04.000 --> 11:08.000]  but you know what we laid down to them so they almost
[11:08.000 --> 11:12.000]  took the planet over and now communist China
[11:12.000 --> 11:16.000]  is the new world order's answer to America
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.000]  not just going to defeat us economically and militarily they're going to become us
[11:20.000 --> 11:24.000]  we're going to be wedded to it and it's going to be the man we're going to be the lady
[11:24.000 --> 11:28.000]  there's not lubrication going to be used here
[11:28.000 --> 11:32.000]  so that's where we are
[11:32.000 --> 11:36.000]  yeah there it is the economists that's the Rothschild's literally on that
[11:36.000 --> 11:40.000]  the Chinese century is well underway
[11:40.000 --> 11:44.000]  that was 2018
[11:44.000 --> 11:48.000]  is that really going the way you thought it would no it's not going the way
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  you thought it would the best laid plans of mice and men often
[11:52.000 --> 11:56.000]  go astray and up in their high perches above all their slaves
[11:56.000 --> 12:00.000]  at the Bilderberg and the Rothschild and the Rockefeller and the CFR
[12:00.000 --> 12:04.000]  combines all run by the same people at the top
[12:04.000 --> 12:08.000]  they believe they're invincible out there with G.G. Ping and his big military
[12:08.000 --> 12:12.000]  parades but just like with Hitler the Soviet Union
[12:12.000 --> 12:16.000]  they're not going to get what they want they're going to get a lot of it and it's going to be rough
[12:16.000 --> 12:20.000]  and it's going to get so horrible everyone's going to be forced to get up off their asses
[12:20.000 --> 12:24.000]  do something and repudiate this and admit that
[12:24.000 --> 12:28.000]  you were wrong
[12:28.000 --> 12:32.000]  you will be forced to take action
[12:32.000 --> 12:36.000]  you will be forced to fight for your very life
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.000]  because when it was easy to win you didn't stand up for the unborn
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.000]  when it was easy to win you didn't stand up for the old people when it was easy to win
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.000]  you didn't stand up for your own right your own territory your own freedoms
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.000]  and what are rights? rights aren't just the term a right you have it's a right that people fought for
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.000]  so there are rights of passage there are rights of blood payment
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.000]  that you've been living off of that I've been living off of all of this largesse
[13:00.000 --> 13:04.000]  was money in the bank it was blood in the bank it was blood sweat and tears
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.000]  it was paid for
[13:08.000 --> 13:12.000]  but we took it for granted and so now
[13:12.000 --> 13:16.000]  like you pull a plug on a bathtub it's circling the drain faster and faster
[13:16.000 --> 13:20.000]  the water's going down quicker and quicker and quicker and we're about to be high and dry
[13:20.000 --> 13:24.000]  and all the denial and all of it's going to be over
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.000]  and the nightmare will get more intense as they claim oh the answer is more socialism
[13:28.000 --> 13:32.000]  more communism more satanism more new world order and it'll finally get
[13:32.000 --> 13:36.000]  so terrible that the enforcers and the
[13:36.000 --> 13:40.000]  jail guards of the new world order will start rebelling but then the globalist
[13:40.000 --> 13:44.000]  have always failed the jackabins have always failed because
[13:44.000 --> 13:48.000]  humans finally wake up that's why the robots
[13:48.000 --> 13:52.000]  the drones the combat robots the controls the automated
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.000]  chips everything not working if they hit a switch that's their do sex
[13:56.000 --> 14:00.000]  that's their ace in the hole
[14:00.000 --> 14:04.000]  that's their secret weapon that's their master
[14:04.000 --> 14:08.000]  plan so we move to rural areas we become independent we
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.000]  educate everyone about the new world order we dig in and we don't comply with
[14:12.000 --> 14:16.000]  any of the new world order and we boycott the new world order and we boycott their
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.000]  big companies and we boycott their systems because they are the enemy
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.000]  and we support the independent speaking of that
[14:24.000 --> 14:28.000]  this has been in development for over a year two years really
[14:28.000 --> 14:32.000]  and we're really proud of it but we're launching eight other products with it with a whole new product
[14:32.000 --> 14:36.000]  line of really high quality stuff and it's being done under Dr. Jones Essentials
[14:36.000 --> 14:40.000]  another company a separate company from me and we sell the product as we diversify
[14:40.000 --> 14:44.000]  operations for a lot of reasons
[14:44.000 --> 14:48.000]  and platforming you name it and so we have activated
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.000]  charcoal mouthwash and super high quality
[14:52.000 --> 14:56.000]  activated charcoal toothpaste with no additives this stuff is amazing
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.000]  this was not to compete with the old toothpaste the whitening toothpaste and super blue
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.000]  you saw the Soros financed attorney general
[15:04.000 --> 15:08.000]  that sent everybody to die in the nursing homes the mass murderer Leticia James
[15:08.000 --> 15:12.000]  come out and say that I said I had a COVID-19 cure when I didn't she tried to criminally get me a bunch of
[15:12.000 --> 15:16.000]  other stuff so we just stopped selling it so she stopped saying that we are
[15:16.000 --> 15:20.000]  planning litigation we got some stuff behind the scenes it's got to be cleared up before we do that but we have
[15:20.000 --> 15:24.000]  to go after but this has nothing to do with COVID-19
[15:24.000 --> 15:28.000]  it's activated charcoal a bunch of essential oils and things it's for that quality we can't sell it
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.000]  to you yet it's been in for a couple weeks there's one other test that's got to be done
[15:32.000 --> 15:36.000]  because we follow all the most strict things I thought the test were in I thought it was
[15:36.000 --> 15:40.000]  done the final test a certificate of authenticity it's not
[15:40.000 --> 15:44.000]  that's in next week test being done so we don't have this on sale until next week
[15:44.000 --> 15:48.000]  so the big sale the big new thing I told you we had is not here
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.000]  but we went ahead and just launched we had last year at this time
[15:52.000 --> 15:56.000]  and that's Christmas comes in July where everything's free shipping
[15:56.000 --> 16:10.000]  on air in 26 years starting about 24 years ago I began to get calls from major Hollywood directors producers actors they wanted to meet with me and they said what is your formal education
[16:10.000 --> 16:14.000]  I said well really nothing but a few years of college they said well how are you
[16:14.000 --> 16:18.000]  one of the best science fiction or cultural writers we've ever heard
[16:18.000 --> 16:22.000]  the stuff you come up with is just unbelievable
[16:22.000 --> 16:26.000]  we'd like you to be in movies we'd like you to write with us we'd like you to do voiceovers
[16:26.000 --> 16:30.000]  you're just a renaissance man and folks know I was in some movies and Harry Shearer
[16:30.000 --> 16:34.000]  made statements like that and a lot of others I'm not bragging I kept explaining to him
[16:34.000 --> 16:38.000]  I said do you understand I didn't come up with any of this
[16:38.000 --> 16:42.000]  I'm reading globalist MIT white papers and futurist documents
[16:42.000 --> 16:46.000]  and they would just laugh me and say oh no way then I would give them the documents
[16:46.000 --> 16:50.000]  they would get very very scared you know the next time I saw them in a few months
[16:50.000 --> 16:54.000]  and say man you're right this is just hoping folks I didn't make
[16:54.000 --> 16:58.000]  any of this up okay it's real it's real
[16:58.000 --> 17:02.000]  the reasons that the globalist launched this planetary lockdown
[17:02.000 --> 17:06.000]  the number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes
[17:06.000 --> 17:10.000]  we've gone over those purposes many times here on air
[17:10.000 --> 17:14.000]  the casual society the surveillance system global government medical tyranny
[17:14.000 --> 17:18.000]  forced inoculation but the most important facet is
[17:18.000 --> 17:22.000]  it teaches us that we are obsolete that we are non-essential
[17:22.000 --> 17:26.000]  as we begin to witness automation
[17:26.000 --> 17:30.000]  computers and robots take over the jobs that people once
[17:30.000 --> 17:34.000]  had by design this isn't like it's some
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.000]  advancement that we just fell into it's been pre-planned organized
[17:38.000 --> 17:42.000]  globally and it's extremely predatory and
[17:42.000 --> 17:46.000]  through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations
[17:46.000 --> 17:50.000]  the central banks that control it all are able to pick the
[17:50.000 --> 17:54.000]  winners and the losers and consolidate power this
[17:54.000 --> 18:18.000]  is the truest form of technocracy fascism
[18:18.000 --> 18:24.000]  what's up with the angel wings kind of a roman
[18:24.000 --> 18:28.000]  archetypal standard symbol
[18:28.000 --> 18:32.000]  with a skull and that's not plastic from
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.000]  the store and that double-edged dagger right there
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.000]  it's actually a tri-edged dagger
[18:40.000 --> 18:44.000]  maybe later I'll tell you what the symbolism for me
[18:44.000 --> 18:48.000]  means in it it's definitely a message to everybody
[18:48.000 --> 18:52.000]  you will not escape God's judgment
[18:52.000 --> 18:56.000]  God is above death God is above humans in war and life itself
[18:56.000 --> 19:00.000]  ha ha ha ha ha
[19:00.000 --> 19:04.000]  that's right
[19:04.000 --> 19:08.000]  you globalists don't want to be angels for sure so don't try to drag us down
[19:08.000 --> 19:12.000]  with you we don't want to be angels
[19:12.000 --> 19:16.000]  we want to serve the same power
[19:16.000 --> 19:20.000]  it serves that God
[19:20.000 --> 19:24.000]  okay let me tell you what we got coming up
[19:24.000 --> 19:28.000]  earth shattering information
[19:28.000 --> 19:32.000]  on the covid-19 2.0 super draconian lockdown and what it's going to force you into
[19:32.000 --> 19:36.000]  the forced inoculations the contact tracers in your house
[19:36.000 --> 19:40.000]  the taking of your family members the whole nightmare is not coming
[19:40.000 --> 19:44.000]  now it's here we did predict it but it's here now
[19:44.000 --> 19:48.000]  it's here like somebody tells you you smoked three packs of cigarettes a day
[19:48.000 --> 19:52.000]  for 40 years you're going to get lung cancer and you're finally coughing up blood and you go to the doctor
[19:52.000 --> 19:56.000]  and you got a big old tumor and you don't have to wait anymore
[19:56.000 --> 20:00.000]  now why am I getting to this really negative news because we got a chance to turn this around though
[20:00.000 --> 20:04.000]  but not much
[20:04.000 --> 20:08.000]  oh they're going to win the next few big rounds
[20:08.000 --> 20:12.000]  I would like to bypass the really bad stuff and
[20:12.000 --> 20:16.000]  getting out of this easy we've already messed up we're not going to get that but we got a chance to
[20:16.000 --> 20:20.000]  have a safe crash landing less of a deadly
[20:20.000 --> 20:24.000]  collapse but people don't really get the fear of God
[20:24.000 --> 20:28.000]  at them and get busy I gotta tell you
[20:28.000 --> 20:32.000]  man I guess we kind of deserve it so whatever but just everybody better get ready then
[20:32.000 --> 20:36.000]  okay because we're talking war on the streets collapse down on earth you have to fight for your life
[20:36.000 --> 20:40.000]  now we're going to get into George Soros
[20:40.000 --> 20:44.000]  and just him spreading his satanic black wings over the earth
[20:44.000 --> 20:48.000]  that's coming up and a lot of military news economic
[20:48.000 --> 20:52.000]  news you name it but let's get to this first
[20:52.000 --> 20:56.000]  it was David Rockefeller when Mao Zedong died in 1976
[20:56.000 --> 21:00.000]  wrote a big op-ed piece you can just type in David Rockefeller
[21:00.000 --> 21:04.000]  New York Times article Mao Zedong he wrote two of them but
[21:04.000 --> 21:08.000]  you'll find the messages from a world traveler
[21:08.000 --> 21:12.000]  I think it's the exact headline and he says I help put Mao in
[21:12.000 --> 21:16.000]  I love Mao Mao's the answer communism's what we need this is from the richest
[21:16.000 --> 21:20.000]  man in the world arguably at the time because he wants monopolies
[21:20.000 --> 21:24.000]  his grandfather said competition
[21:24.000 --> 21:28.000]  is a sin
[21:28.000 --> 21:32.000]  they don't like competition
[21:32.000 --> 21:36.000]  they don't like monopolies so here's Joe Biden
[21:36.000 --> 21:40.000]  uses quote notably uttered by Mao Zedong during a big money fundraiser
[21:40.000 --> 21:44.000]  report and this is why that wrote down the transcript that was there during a Q&A session
[21:44.000 --> 21:48.000]  there's no audio or video of this yet Fox News reports
[21:48.000 --> 21:52.000]  Biden held a digital fundraiser featuring former president Obama
[21:52.000 --> 21:56.000]  advisor Valerie Jarrett according to the Atlantic's Eric Isaac Dover
[21:56.000 --> 22:00.000]  the former vice president cited an old Chinese proverb which discussed
[22:00.000 --> 22:04.000]  economic relief for women during a Q&A of course it wasn't a Chinese proverb
[22:04.000 --> 22:08.000]  it was a communist proverb you've got to get real economic relief into women's hands
[22:08.000 --> 22:12.000]  Biden reportedly said later say that women hold up half the sky of famous Mao Zedong
[22:12.000 --> 22:16.000]  quote that's who actually said that
[22:16.000 --> 22:20.000]  so why is that so important
[22:20.000 --> 22:24.000]  they forced hundreds of millions of Chinese women out of their houses with their children so you can only have one child
[22:24.000 --> 22:28.000]  if you behave yourself and put them in forced labor so that's
[22:28.000 --> 22:32.000]  government though for women just like in the Middle East is sex slavery
[22:32.000 --> 22:36.000]  or wearing a burqa over your head which we all do now
[22:36.000 --> 22:40.000]  we're all being put into the cult ritual
[22:40.000 --> 22:44.000]  but remember this clip from a few years ago the full videos up on
[22:44.000 --> 22:48.000]  infowars.com with the headline
[22:48.000 --> 22:52.000]  Joe Biden says all American
[22:52.000 --> 22:56.000]  institutions governmental academic ecclesiastical we all need to
[22:56.000 --> 23:00.000]  stop Chinese communist oversight into what we do
[23:00.000 --> 23:04.000]  because they own our debt they own Hollywood we've been positioned where they have all the jobs
[23:04.000 --> 23:08.000]  not to help the Chinese people but to exploit them globally
[23:08.000 --> 23:12.000]  and that's what the globalists have done with their fake fiat money and now their slave labor
[23:12.000 --> 23:16.000]  and no environmental standards over there but massive standards on us they made it impossible for us to even
[23:16.000 --> 23:20.000]  operate and then put us into check but here comes Trump pulling
[23:20.000 --> 23:24.000]  us out of check putting them into check mate so here's what Biden had to say
[23:24.000 --> 23:28.000]  I'm also proud that more than
[23:28.000 --> 23:32.000]  160 Fortune 500 companies are operating in Chengdu
[23:32.000 --> 23:36.000]  high tech zone including pioneer American business like Intel
[23:36.000 --> 23:40.000]  Dell and Oracle the U.S.-China relationship
[23:40.000 --> 23:44.000]  has also improved dramatically in the past 30 years
[23:44.000 --> 23:48.000]  in order to cement this robust partnership we have to go beyond
[23:48.000 --> 23:52.000]  close ties between Washington and Beijing
[23:52.000 --> 23:56.000]  that's what we're working on every day
[23:56.000 --> 24:00.000]  go beyond it to include all levels of government
[24:00.000 --> 24:04.000]  go beyond it to include classrooms and laboratories
[24:04.000 --> 24:08.000]  athletic fields and boardrooms
[24:08.000 --> 24:12.000]  that's why we launched our 100,000 strong initiative to boost the number of
[24:12.000 --> 24:16.000]  American students studying in China each year
[24:16.000 --> 24:20.000]  and here's the article flashback Biden calls for communist Chinese influence at all levels of government
[24:20.000 --> 24:24.000]  but it's all part of throwing it your face
[24:24.000 --> 24:28.000]  see they build it up behind the scenes they demoralize the public
[24:28.000 --> 24:32.000]  they train all these young people that have two or three college degrees
[24:32.000 --> 24:36.000]  well you're going to be a communist there's going to be a utopia Bernie Sanders teaches that
[24:36.000 --> 24:40.000]  then all that happens is Bernie Sanders and his wife with over 100 people under him
[24:40.000 --> 24:44.000]  swindle all the money out of the college over five years and collapse 100 year old college
[24:44.000 --> 24:48.000]  you get nothing but a death camp a slave camp if you're lucky
[24:48.000 --> 24:52.000]  you get to work 18 hours a day while they live in a palace
[24:52.000 --> 24:56.000]  and fly above you in helicopters
[24:56.000 --> 25:00.000]  and that's how they get you like again a Nigerian scam or other scams
[25:00.000 --> 25:04.000]  people buy so many lottery tickets they always keep buying they think they're going to win
[25:04.000 --> 25:08.000]  or gamblers just I got to keep gambling I'm going to get my money back
[25:08.000 --> 25:12.000]  and it's just like I bet on communism I bet on socialism I bet on the left
[25:12.000 --> 25:16.000]  while Biden and the deep staters admit they shut the economy down
[25:16.000 --> 25:20.000]  to punish Trump and America and are trying to implode the economy under
[25:20.000 --> 25:24.000]  cloward and piven because they can't compete with a free market system
[25:24.000 --> 25:28.000]  and the lazy schmucks that don't get that they've got more
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.000]  out of this system they can get anywhere else for less work
[25:32.000 --> 25:36.000]  and be who they want to be like nowhere else
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.000]  they literally think they're going to rule in some communist takeover
[25:40.000 --> 25:44.000]  how many undercover videos of anti-flim black lives matter and
[25:44.000 --> 25:48.000]  and all this do we have and now they're public they're like we will soon take over
[25:48.000 --> 25:52.000]  you will work for us in slave camps we will teach you
[25:52.000 --> 25:56.000]  it's all coming up
[25:56.000 --> 26:00.000]  ladies and gentlemen today but there it is for you
[26:00.000 --> 26:04.000]  just absolute communist Chinese garbage in your face
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.000]  how did I know that's what happened the CFR runs the country
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.000]  set up by British intelligence it's called a round table group
[26:12.000 --> 26:16.000]  and they set up corporate round table groups in every country South Africa
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.000]  Germany
[26:20.000 --> 26:24.000]  Mexico that's who really runs it that's how they bypass corporate
[26:24.000 --> 26:28.000]  governmental ecclesiastical round table groups
[26:28.000 --> 26:32.000]  they're the elite playing us off against each other their globalism
[26:32.000 --> 26:36.000]  and they don't want you having money or being happy they want you poor under their control
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.000]  that's the real power they want they did all this maneuvering and the AI takeover
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.000]  to position us to now come and sterilize us and fry us with 5G
[26:44.000 --> 26:48.000]  and kill us remember Hitler he had a plan to take over
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.000]  he had a EU plan he had a plan to poison the food once he took over to slowly kill people
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.000]  so they wouldn't know what hit him oh yeah enjoy

[30:12.000 --> 30:20.000]  if you're receiving this transmission
[30:20.000 --> 30:24.000]  you are the resistance if you are receiving this
[30:24.000 --> 30:28.000]  transmission you are the resistance
[30:28.000 --> 30:34.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[30:34.000 --> 30:39.000]  Never a dull moment when you're in reality.
[30:39.000 --> 30:47.000]  It's horrific, it's horrifying, it's exhilarating, it's empowering, it's engaging, it's real.
[30:47.000 --> 30:53.000]  And the more you learn how the universe works, the more you make the connections and discover.
[30:53.000 --> 31:02.000]  You stop being the reactive jellyfish that simply responds to stimuli.
[31:02.000 --> 31:17.000]  You begin taking control of your destiny. You begin to become empowered.
[31:17.000 --> 31:24.000]  All right, I'll get into the COVID-19 bombshell information and it's all the biggest yet.
[31:24.000 --> 31:27.000]  Just confirming our worst analysis, which isn't hard to do.
[31:27.000 --> 31:31.000]  We've got lockstep, we've got event 201, we've got, I'm just admitting the whole thing,
[31:31.000 --> 31:37.000]  that they'll use a real virus or a contrived virus to infect everyone and see everyone suspect
[31:37.000 --> 31:41.000]  and then use a global system to track everywhere you go and establish world government.
[31:41.000 --> 31:46.000]  It actually says that in the 10-year-old lockstep Rockefeller plan.
[31:46.000 --> 31:50.000]  People are reading this going, what the hell?
[31:50.000 --> 31:54.000]  Why would they be so honest about it?
[31:54.000 --> 31:59.000]  Because they have to have training manuals to hand out as a drill so that when they do it,
[31:59.000 --> 32:04.000]  they don't get busted for conspiracy.
[32:04.000 --> 32:07.000]  You understand?
[32:07.000 --> 32:14.000]  They go, oh yeah, we all just happen to have this lockstep in this event 201 and happens to be exactly what's happening.
[32:14.000 --> 32:18.000]  But we are not planning it, we're not involved in it.
[32:18.000 --> 32:22.000]  Sure in our drill, John Hopkins runs all the numbers, they do it in reality.
[32:22.000 --> 32:25.000]  And sure in our drill, the UN gives all the directives, they do it in reality.
[32:25.000 --> 32:27.000]  And sure it's a Corona SARS virus.
[32:27.000 --> 32:28.000]  And sure we run the lab.
[32:28.000 --> 32:30.000]  And sure we transferred it in 2005 under major protest.
[32:30.000 --> 32:31.000]  And sure we weaponize it.
[32:31.000 --> 32:32.000]  And sure we have the patents.
[32:32.000 --> 32:34.000]  And sure we're coming out with the vaccines.
[32:34.000 --> 32:35.000]  And sure we owe those.
[32:35.000 --> 32:37.000]  We'll make money off those and the testing and the tracking and the tracing.
[32:37.000 --> 32:41.000]  And sure the Billable and the Gates Foundation with the Clinton Global Initiative run the contact.
[32:41.000 --> 32:43.000]  Tracers are making $5 billion.
[32:43.000 --> 32:45.000]  But it's okay.
[32:45.000 --> 32:47.000]  Because Tim Cook's okay.
[32:47.000 --> 32:49.000]  So, you know, that's where all of this goes.
[32:49.000 --> 32:51.000]  This is all a big plan.
[32:51.000 --> 32:52.000]  It's all systematic.
[32:52.000 --> 32:55.000]  It's all a giant fraud.
[32:55.000 --> 32:58.000]  I was looking this morning at numbers out of Texas.
[32:58.000 --> 33:02.000]  Did you know flu deaths and pneumonia deaths and all these other deaths are way down?
[33:02.000 --> 33:08.000]  Because they've all been moved into the COVID column just like they've done around the country and months before.
[33:08.000 --> 33:12.000]  They're just still doing it and then admitting they're doing it.
[33:12.000 --> 33:14.000]  Because they're run by lawyers.
[33:14.000 --> 33:19.000]  And they know you have to put it out in plain view and have people accept it.
[33:19.000 --> 33:21.000]  Now the lie has a little cover on it.
[33:21.000 --> 33:25.000]  But that's it.
[33:25.000 --> 33:29.000]  Bill Gates, more testing and contact tracing needed to safely reopen U.S.
[33:29.000 --> 33:30.000]  That's right.
[33:30.000 --> 33:33.000]  And he smiles with Fareed Zarkarian says it's never reopening.
[33:33.000 --> 33:35.000]  It looks like he's having an orgasm.
[33:35.000 --> 33:38.000]  When he talks about people dying in mass and bad reactions to vaccines,
[33:38.000 --> 33:43.000]  he starts giggling like an Academy Award winner would get for playing a psycho,
[33:43.000 --> 33:45.000]  torturing a child to death.
[33:45.000 --> 33:52.000]  The man is a flaming maniac, eugenicist, depopulation demon.
[33:52.000 --> 33:58.000]  Imagine if I was on TV talking about millions of dead and 700,000 bad reactions in America.
[33:58.000 --> 33:59.000]  It's never reopening.
[33:59.000 --> 34:06.000]  I'm just like, I mean, he's just like, it's the funnest thing you ever saw.
[34:06.000 --> 34:09.000]  Sorry, I said that was next segment, didn't I?
[34:09.000 --> 34:10.000]  I started getting into it now.
[34:10.000 --> 34:11.000]  Let me get into this.
[34:11.000 --> 34:17.000]  So you got the Communist Chinese set up by the big banks and traders in our government
[34:17.000 --> 34:21.000]  and the Rothschilds in 1949.
[34:21.000 --> 34:26.000]  And now here we are 60, 70 years later and the things taking the world over with the
[34:26.000 --> 34:31.000]  authoritarianism, the money, Hollywood, the universities, just everything is America bashing.
[34:31.000 --> 34:32.000]  America sucks.
[34:32.000 --> 34:35.000]  The NFL says don't have the Star Spangled Banner.
[34:35.000 --> 34:38.000]  Don't have the, you know, they're going to have some Black Lives Matter deal.
[34:38.000 --> 34:39.000]  You're like, what happened?
[34:39.000 --> 34:41.000]  Well, you got undermined.
[34:41.000 --> 34:46.000]  And now no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[34:46.000 --> 34:48.000]  You're like, oh, that's just a bunch of college idiots.
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.000]  No, those were the metastasizing polyps of cancer.
[34:52.000 --> 34:56.000]  Now they're floating around and George Soros comes out.
[34:56.000 --> 35:01.000]  Big article on informers.com announces it's doubling down on funding black led justice
[35:01.000 --> 35:05.000]  organizations like Black Lives Matter in an article in the New York Times.
[35:05.000 --> 35:11.000]  And of course, also funding at the very same time.
[35:11.000 --> 35:15.000]  It's just incredible how they're funding Antifa as well.
[35:15.000 --> 35:22.000]  But the first thing I want to go ahead and play for you is the hysteria, the craziness
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  that's going on.
[35:24.000 --> 35:29.000]  This is a video of a deranged SJW yells to airline passengers.
[35:29.000 --> 35:35.000]  I will kill everybody on this plane unless you accept Jesus was a black man.
[35:35.000 --> 35:43.000]  Then we'll play the clip here of Marxist BLM protestor leader calls for black militia
[35:43.000 --> 35:45.000]  revolution.
[35:45.000 --> 35:52.000]  Police man killed by ex cop biker because he was white, ranted about Trump and white
[35:52.000 --> 35:53.000]  people.
[35:53.000 --> 35:58.000]  And you look at the look on these guy's faces when they come up to just a random road and
[35:58.000 --> 36:01.000]  shoot a white dude in the head or shoot a family or whatever.
[36:01.000 --> 36:03.000]  It's usually white dudes that do it.
[36:03.000 --> 36:08.000]  They have looks of ecstasy and satisfaction of their stoicness.
[36:08.000 --> 36:13.000]  They just climbed a mountain and took out a Nazi machine gun nest because the media
[36:13.000 --> 36:16.000]  is telling them they're heroes, telling them they're good.
[36:16.000 --> 36:19.000]  They take that as an authority, not a chai-com funded attack.
[36:19.000 --> 36:23.000]  So here's two of those clips back to back.
[36:23.000 --> 36:34.000]  I will kill everybody on this plane unless you accept Jesus was a black man.
[36:34.000 --> 36:44.000]  So everybody, everybody, I will kill everybody except it.
[36:44.000 --> 36:46.000]  Die in the name of Jesus.
[36:46.000 --> 37:04.000]  Die in the name of Jesus.
[37:04.000 --> 37:09.000]  Now let's hear from the black militia leader.
[37:09.000 --> 37:12.000]  Racism thrives on capitalism.
[37:12.000 --> 37:16.000]  The back of racism is capitalism.
[37:16.000 --> 37:20.000]  And they say about education, we need a black militia.
[37:20.000 --> 37:24.000]  When I say that, I'm not saying it because I want people to fear and think we're coming
[37:24.000 --> 37:25.000]  violent.
[37:25.000 --> 37:28.000]  What we're saying is you push, we push.
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  You fight, we fight.
[37:30.000 --> 37:34.000]  Peace is not peace until you recognize our life and we're not going to lay down no more.
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  I'm not going down on a knee.
[37:36.000 --> 37:41.000]  I'm always going to be ten toes standing just like my ancestors, ten toes standing.
[37:41.000 --> 37:42.000]  No justice.
[37:42.000 --> 37:43.000]  No peace.
[37:43.000 --> 37:44.000]  No justice.
[37:44.000 --> 37:45.000]  No peace.
[37:45.000 --> 37:46.000]  Take it to the streets.
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.000]  I can't hear you.
[37:48.000 --> 37:49.000]  No justice.
[37:49.000 --> 37:50.000]  No peace.
[37:50.000 --> 37:57.000]  So she's going to fight to get into your country and then she's going to bitch and complain
[37:57.000 --> 37:59.000]  about it and say she must overthrow you.
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.000]  The police is no different from the KKK.
[38:01.000 --> 38:08.000]  And then there'll be 12 to 1 black on white crime.
[38:08.000 --> 38:13.000]  But statistics don't matter and it was her ancestors, soul black people to white people.
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  But none of that matters.
[38:15.000 --> 38:16.000]  It's all she's good.
[38:16.000 --> 38:17.000]  She's black.
[38:17.000 --> 38:18.000]  You're bad.
[38:18.000 --> 38:19.000]  You're white.
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.000]  And then you stand around in camo and feel powerful about communism when Karl Marx said that black
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.000]  people weren't humans and that he hated Jews.
[38:26.000 --> 38:29.000]  But that's okay because Tim Cook's gay.
[38:29.000 --> 38:34.000]  Tim Cook runs giant death camps, millions of people making Apple widgets on record.
[38:34.000 --> 38:35.000]  It's okay.
[38:35.000 --> 38:40.000]  He wears little black sweaters and goes, and see, that's what this is all about.
[38:40.000 --> 38:48.000]  Ignorance's video, UK black writers tear down statue of African icon Haley Cecelli.
[38:48.000 --> 38:51.000]  And it goes on from there.
[38:51.000 --> 38:55.000]  That's what you're dealing with is invincible arrogance and evil and hatred.
[38:55.000 --> 38:57.000]  I haven't gotten to one-tenth of these.
[38:57.000 --> 39:03.000]  You know, the BLM supporters celebrate death of mother shot dead by saying for saying all
[39:03.000 --> 39:08.000]  this matter and BLM is now publicly celebrating her murder.
[39:08.000 --> 39:14.000]  And again, police man killed ex cop biker because he was white, ranted about Trump and
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  white people after arrest.
[39:16.000 --> 39:20.000]  I know a retired SWAT team officer who teaches CrossFit classes.
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.000]  They found out he was a retired officer.
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  They said, we don't want your kind here.
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  You're fired because you were an officer.
[39:26.000 --> 39:27.000]  That's someone I know.
[39:27.000 --> 39:28.000]  That's CrossFit in Austin.
[39:28.000 --> 39:31.000]  That's who these cultists are.
[39:31.000 --> 39:37.000]  And there's nothing lost on them, ironically, that they're such hypocrites when they call
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  the cops when there's a problem.
[39:39.000 --> 39:40.000]  You understand?
[39:40.000 --> 39:44.000]  Or they call up when their power's off and, you know, bitch for the telephone company
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  or power company to come fix the lines.
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  They want the power.
[39:48.000 --> 39:50.000]  It's a leftist takeover.
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  They've been to college to learn how to do this.
[39:52.000 --> 39:53.000]  That's it.
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  That's all it is.
[39:55.000 --> 40:01.000]  Americans have had freedom for so long and most Americans were born into such docile
[40:01.000 --> 40:05.000]  times compared to the rest of history that we really have a blind spot for tyranny.
[40:05.000 --> 40:11.000]  We don't appreciate the American way, truth, justice, due process, the right to self-defense,
[40:11.000 --> 40:14.000]  private property because we've had it so long and we just think that's how the rest of the
[40:14.000 --> 40:15.000]  world is.
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.000]  to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak as
[40:24.000 --> 40:29.000]  well as the strong is something the West invented and that's what made our modern world.
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.000]  That's now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists who say humans are ugly
[40:34.000 --> 40:39.000]  and bad for the earth and we need to be cold and dumbed down and put into subgroups that
[40:39.000 --> 40:44.000]  the elites dominate, manipulate and command if we're even lucky enough to stay alive.
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  And that's what COVID-19 is.
[40:46.000 --> 40:52.000]  A global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family, against prosperity and
[40:52.000 --> 40:53.000]  against your future.
[40:53.000 --> 40:54.000]  Stand up and fight.
[40:54.000 --> 40:55.000]  You deserve what you get.
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  I know what we'll do to make them conform to our cult.
[40:57.000 --> 41:02.000]  We'll all tell them to wear masks or they're going to die and then we'll release the pressure
[41:02.000 --> 41:05.000]  for a while and then bring it back and squeeze it harder and release it again and we'll be
[41:05.000 --> 41:10.000]  the virtuous and we'll be the angels even though our lord and master Bill Gates helped
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  fund the whole COVID-19.
[41:12.000 --> 41:16.000]  No, don't seduce me.
[41:16.000 --> 41:17.000]  That's right.
[41:17.000 --> 41:20.000]  That's the code word for Bill Gates, this operation.
[41:20.000 --> 41:26.000]  He carries out with his good little buddy Dr. Fauci in the surgeon cult.
[41:26.000 --> 41:31.000]  As you know, for girls there's five different types of villains they secretly desire in
[41:31.000 --> 41:32.000]  the romance novels.
[41:32.000 --> 41:38.000]  One of them is the vampire, the werewolf, the billionaire and who else?
[41:38.000 --> 41:39.000]  Oh, that's right.
[41:39.000 --> 41:43.000]  There's the surgeon and then there's one other one and it's so much fun to be ruled over by
[41:43.000 --> 41:48.000]  these psychotic psychopaths and it's so good to know that there are masters and they're
[41:48.000 --> 41:51.000]  coming to rape us with their inoculations.
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  Psychopaths are so hot.
[41:53.000 --> 42:19.000]  Oh, yeah.
[42:19.000 --> 42:45.000]  Dr. Fauci.
[42:45.000 --> 43:11.000]  Dr. Fauci.
[43:11.000 --> 43:39.000]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long term high quality energy powder
[43:39.000 --> 43:40.000]  is.
[43:40.000 --> 43:42.000]  So this, this was designed by one of the top guys in the country.
[43:42.000 --> 43:45.000]  He didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues, but we had to pay a
[43:45.000 --> 43:47.000]  lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[43:47.000 --> 43:51.000]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there.
[43:51.000 --> 43:53.000]  And you're saying that it's made your life better.
[43:53.000 --> 43:54.000]  So that means a lot to me.
[43:54.000 --> 43:55.000]  Thank you to all your truck drivers.
[43:55.000 --> 43:56.000]  We love you.
[43:56.000 --> 44:12.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:12.000 --> 44:17.000]  Welcome back.
[44:17.000 --> 44:30.000]  And of course, now I convicted weatherman lady has been caught running black lives matter.
[44:30.000 --> 44:32.000]  And if you talk about it, you get banned off the internet.
[44:32.000 --> 44:33.000]  A very famous member.
[44:33.000 --> 44:34.000]  But that's another lady.
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  This is Angela Davis, another one of these nasty people.
[44:36.000 --> 44:38.000]  And here she is talking about Biden.
[44:38.000 --> 44:48.000]  I don't see this election as being about choosing a candidate who will be able to lead us in
[44:48.000 --> 44:49.000]  the right direction.
[44:49.000 --> 44:58.000]  It will be about choosing a candidate who can be most effectively pressured into allowing
[44:58.000 --> 45:02.000]  more space for the evolving anti-racist movement.
[45:02.000 --> 45:08.000]  Biden is very problematic in many ways.
[45:08.000 --> 45:12.000]  He is not only in terms of his past and the role that he played in pushing toward mass
[45:12.000 --> 45:18.000]  incarceration, but he has indicated that he is opposed to disbanding the police.
[45:18.000 --> 45:20.000]  And this is definitely what we need.
[45:20.000 --> 45:26.000]  We need to reconceptualize the very notion of public safety.
[45:26.000 --> 45:39.000]  But I say, but Biden is far more likely to take mass demands seriously, far more likely
[45:39.000 --> 45:42.000]  than the current occupant of the White House.
[45:42.000 --> 45:47.000]  So let's think about what the left wants financed by big mega banks, the chai comms,
[45:47.000 --> 45:51.000]  the establishment, you know, the woke corporate stuff, all their private security and the
[45:51.000 --> 45:52.000]  rest of it.
[45:52.000 --> 45:55.000]  We don't get police and we also have to have our guns taken.
[45:55.000 --> 46:00.000]  So take all the guns, then no police, and then have Marxists running around shooting us in
[46:00.000 --> 46:04.000]  the head, killing us, coming up to checkpoints and saying, are you for Black Lives Matter?
[46:04.000 --> 46:05.000]  Ah, you're white.
[46:05.000 --> 46:08.000]  I mean, that's what's going on.
[46:08.000 --> 46:13.000]  The most evil, crazy mobs going into churches.
[46:13.000 --> 46:17.000]  Now, guess who's coming up here in just a moment?
[46:17.000 --> 46:18.000]  Roger Stone.
[46:18.000 --> 46:20.000]  We even have him there on screen.
[46:20.000 --> 46:21.000]  There he is.
[46:21.000 --> 46:26.000]  We're going to be going to Roger here in just a moment in the second hour, look very much
[46:26.000 --> 46:30.000]  forward to him, giving us the first big exclusive in depth interview.
[46:30.000 --> 46:31.000]  Went on handy last night.
[46:31.000 --> 46:32.000]  That's awesome.
[46:32.000 --> 46:33.000]  But this time he won't just have 10 minutes.
[46:33.000 --> 46:39.000]  He will have the whole next hour to really get into the election, his clemency being
[46:39.000 --> 46:45.000]  attacked by Mueller, being attacked by Stephanophilus that says that Trump should be, this is
[46:45.000 --> 46:50.000]  unprecedented, that Trump should be removed from office via impeachment for this when
[46:50.000 --> 46:55.000]  Stephanophilus oversaw the pardoning of, you know, pedophiles and murderers and criminals.
[46:55.000 --> 46:57.000]  It's just simply astounding.
[46:57.000 --> 47:00.000]  That is all coming up with Roger Stone.
[47:00.000 --> 47:02.000]  But first, let's finish up this segment.
[47:02.000 --> 47:06.000]  Let's now go back and just show you some of the articles here.
[47:06.000 --> 47:11.000]  The police have announced that Portland is now in a state of a riot and there are people
[47:11.000 --> 47:13.000]  being shot and killed and stabbed every night.
[47:13.000 --> 47:18.000]  And we have all this footage of Antifa stopping random cars and pulling doors open.
[47:18.000 --> 47:23.000]  When they pull the door open and it's a black guy, the guy gets out and beats up the white
[47:23.000 --> 47:24.000]  thug.
[47:24.000 --> 47:31.000]  In fact, you even hear the Antifa go, ooh, because it's a black guy.
[47:31.000 --> 47:34.000]  That's above the law.
[47:34.000 --> 47:37.000]  And so the black guy gets out and slams him into the ground.
[47:37.000 --> 47:43.000]  But then they start just beating up old white people because that's the number one mission
[47:43.000 --> 47:45.000]  is, oh, you're old, you're white.
[47:45.000 --> 47:51.000]  And it's a group of mainly women dressed in black beating up.
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  So stuff's getting really, really crazy.
[47:53.000 --> 47:56.000]  They're hit people in the head with hammers, you name it.
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  And they're just randomly beating people up.
[47:58.000 --> 48:03.000]  But if you have an American flag, they really go after you.
[48:03.000 --> 48:06.000]  Look at this old man.
[48:06.000 --> 48:10.000]  He's just out there, so they steal his bike.
[48:10.000 --> 48:14.000]  And he tries to go get his bike back, so they leave him in the hat.
[48:14.000 --> 48:17.000]  Don't you think we have respect for your fucking son?
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  You think we have respect for your fucking son?
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.000]  They don't have respect for your fucking son.
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.000]  They don't have respect for your fucking son.
[48:23.000 --> 48:25.000]  Hit the door!
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.000]  Hit the door!
[48:27.000 --> 48:28.000]  Hey, what's up?
[48:28.000 --> 48:29.000]  What's up?
[48:29.000 --> 48:36.000]  So if you're a radio listener, they are literally breaking into buildings, attacking people,
[48:36.000 --> 48:40.000]  attacking the police department, trying to break into the police department.
[48:40.000 --> 48:44.000]  I mean, it is just absolute insane asylum.
[48:44.000 --> 48:45.000]  They don't want to get rid of the police.
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  They want to be the police.
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  I mean, we got a few bad police.
[48:49.000 --> 48:50.000]  We got some problems.
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  But that's reflection of us.
[48:52.000 --> 48:57.000]  Can you imagine these people in charge of anything?
[48:57.000 --> 49:00.000]  And again, what they try to do is jump on the front of your car,
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  and then they call the police on you.
[49:02.000 --> 49:06.000]  Like when they blocked last week, the Seattle Highway at night,
[49:06.000 --> 49:12.000]  a guy sees an emergency vehicle, drives around it, and runs over a couple of women, one of them dies,
[49:12.000 --> 49:16.000]  and the news announced white supremacist strikes was a black Somali.
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  He wasn't trying to kill anybody.
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  He was going around cars.
[49:20.000 --> 49:23.000]  And I'll be honest with you, I've driven on the shoulder.
[49:23.000 --> 49:27.000]  I've driven through the grass to get around things as well.
[49:27.000 --> 49:31.000]  But you don't want to do it now because you don't know if there's antifa or black lives matter
[49:31.000 --> 49:34.000]  out in the road blocking it like idiots.
[49:34.000 --> 49:42.000]  And if there is a Darwin Award in this universe, it is playing on the highway at night.
[49:42.000 --> 49:45.000]  That's really, really, really asking for it.
[49:45.000 --> 49:48.000]  Okay, I'm out of time on Soros and the whole revolution.
[49:48.000 --> 49:53.000]  They're trying to finance and how they now admit to it all after they were just denying it all.
[49:53.000 --> 49:58.000]  I have a giant stack of developing lockdown, California lockdown.
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  Texas is coming.
[50:00.000 --> 50:04.000]  Austin, today or tomorrow, we have it from inside the police department and the mayor's office
[50:04.000 --> 50:09.000]  that the mayor is currently planning to lock everything down today or tomorrow.
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  That may not happen, but that's the current thing.
[50:11.000 --> 50:14.000]  The governor has sold us out, and it's going along with this.
[50:14.000 --> 50:17.000]  It's to create a new depression and to drive from office.
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  And it's absolutely insane.
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  They're using inflated numbers, as you know.
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  Florida had 333.
[50:23.000 --> 50:25.000]  That's Don Salazar's top article.
[50:25.000 --> 50:31.000]  333 testing labs found 100% positive.
[50:31.000 --> 50:34.000]  Obviously, folks, they've been told just to say everybody that comes in is positive.
[50:34.000 --> 50:37.000]  I told you about my wife's personal trainer, friend of mine.
[50:37.000 --> 50:41.000]  She trains two old ladies, older women, and they had a cough a few months ago.
[50:41.000 --> 50:44.000]  So they said, let's go in and get tested.
[50:44.000 --> 50:45.000]  The line was too long.
[50:45.000 --> 50:46.000]  They said, just fill out your name and number.
[50:46.000 --> 50:47.000]  We'll call you back later.
[50:47.000 --> 50:48.000]  They got emails.
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  You have COVID-19.
[50:50.000 --> 50:53.000]  And if you read the guidelines that Texas follows, only eight states follow it.
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  Seven Democrat states in Texas.
[50:55.000 --> 50:56.000]  That's what it says.
[50:56.000 --> 51:01.000]  That's all coming up in the third hour today.
[51:01.000 --> 51:05.000]  And we also, again, have Jim Hoff's brother who rides for Gateway Pundit.
[51:05.000 --> 51:08.000]  John Hoff is going to be joining us coming up to break all of that down.
[51:08.000 --> 51:09.000]  We'll also open the phones up.
[51:09.000 --> 51:12.000]  And Paul Joseph Watson will be with us as well.
[51:12.000 --> 51:16.000]  But separately, everybody's been pushing me to promote these.
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  We've tested out a bunch of different companies.
[51:18.000 --> 51:21.000]  Some of them cost way more and don't work as well.
[51:21.000 --> 51:28.000]  So these have a 99% rate with myself and the rest of the crew testing them to block cell phones.
[51:28.000 --> 51:36.000]  Now, see what happens is even when your cell phones off, pings from the GPS, from the cell towers,
[51:36.000 --> 51:40.000]  go to it every few seconds and track everywhere you go and then sell the data.
[51:40.000 --> 51:44.000]  Now, Bill Clinton's foundation with Bill Gates runs this.
[51:44.000 --> 51:45.000]  Chelsea's on the board.
[51:45.000 --> 51:49.000]  And they have the data now on iPhones, androids to track you.
[51:49.000 --> 51:53.000]  They use this data to absolutely enslave you, set you up, sell your data, abuse you.
[51:53.000 --> 51:58.000]  So it's like locking your house at night, closing your windows at night so mosquitoes don't get in.
[51:58.000 --> 52:00.000]  You have to take control of your life.
[52:00.000 --> 52:04.000]  And now that these pockets have gotten thin enough with new materials they have,
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.000]  the old ones didn't work that well, they were like 80% more bulky,
[52:07.000 --> 52:10.000]  I now use these all the time.
[52:10.000 --> 52:14.000]  And it's a way to use your cell phone less to be aware of the fact you're being tracked
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.000]  and to take control of your life.
[52:16.000 --> 52:17.000]  And so this is the only way.
[52:17.000 --> 52:22.000]  You turn the apps off, even when you turn the tracking off, it doesn't work.
[52:22.000 --> 52:23.000]  They're still tracking you.
[52:23.000 --> 52:24.000]  That's admitted in the Wall Street Journal.
[52:24.000 --> 52:26.000]  And Fox News admitted that last week.
[52:26.000 --> 52:28.000]  So these are the privacy pockets.
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  They come in red.
[52:30.000 --> 52:31.000]  They come in blue.
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  They come in green and black.
[52:33.000 --> 52:39.000]  They have a great pouch system that takes almost any size of phone from small to large.
[52:39.000 --> 52:44.000]  They have some bigger units for tablets and iPads and things like that at infowarsstore.com.
[52:44.000 --> 52:47.000]  You absolutely need these.
[52:47.000 --> 52:48.000]  They're $19.95.
[52:48.000 --> 52:54.000]  Most people sell pockets of this quality for $29.95 because they need to mark it up 200%.
[52:54.000 --> 52:55.000]  We don't do that.
[52:55.000 --> 52:57.000]  They're marked up 100%.
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  So we make $10 on these.
[52:59.000 --> 53:01.000]  You really need to get these and give them as gifts.
[53:01.000 --> 53:05.000]  It's also an educational thing for your wife, your husband, your neighbor, your boss, your employees about,
[53:05.000 --> 53:09.000]  hey, you have nothing to hide but you still lock your door at night, right?
[53:09.000 --> 53:12.000]  You have nothing to hide but you have a passcode on your phone because there are people that want to break into it.
[53:12.000 --> 53:15.000]  Well, they're doing it remotely, including hackers and criminals.
[53:15.000 --> 53:16.000]  And why is that important?
[53:16.000 --> 53:20.000]  New York Times, Washington Post, all reports on infowars.com as well.
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  New court filing.
[53:22.000 --> 53:32.000]  Gislaine Maxwell fled across house during raid.
[53:32.000 --> 53:35.000]  FBI found tinfoil wrapped cell phone.
[53:35.000 --> 53:38.000]  So she was running when they busted in to get to the tinfoil wrapped cell phone.
[53:38.000 --> 53:48.000]  I guess the super spy wasn't smart enough to have one of these because if you are trying to not be tracked and traced by the insurance companies,
[53:48.000 --> 53:52.000]  the foreign banks, the globalists, Antifa, if you've got any apps on your phone,
[53:52.000 --> 53:56.000]  they're selling all the companies, all the data to the Democrats.
[53:56.000 --> 53:59.000]  You want to take control of your life.
[53:59.000 --> 54:02.000]  Well, she didn't have a privacy pocket.
[54:02.000 --> 54:06.000]  She had tinfoil, which does work if you put,
[54:06.000 --> 54:09.000]  I'm told six or seven layers of it on there.
[54:09.000 --> 54:15.000]  Well, why do you want to have a tinfoil when you can have it actually with the copper Faraday cage that completely blocks it?
[54:15.000 --> 54:19.000]  When I say 99%, we test it for weeks and every once in a while,
[54:19.000 --> 54:25.000]  if you get right underneath the cell tower, it's strong enough to still get in and track where you are.
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  So again, this is something that is essential.
[54:27.000 --> 54:30.000]  It's an infowarstore.com, your privacy pocket.
[54:30.000 --> 54:36.000]  To tell Bill Clinton and the contact tracers and all of them burning hell, go to hell.
[54:36.000 --> 54:41.000]  You may be rapist, you may be child molesters, but you're not going to rape our privacy.
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  What if Gisling Maxwell would have had this?
[54:43.000 --> 55:12.000]  You wouldn't have got caught.
[55:13.000 --> 55:19.000]  But they need an event like COVID-19 to teach a mammal to wear some covering over its nose,
[55:19.000 --> 55:24.000]  over its breathing tubes to set the precedent for the forced inoculations,
[55:24.000 --> 55:30.000]  for the GMO, for the 5G, and for all the things that they admit will end our humanity as we know it.
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.000]  That's why this is so evil.
[55:32.000 --> 55:36.000]  Their whole agenda for cashless society, global government,
[55:36.000 --> 55:40.000]  UN control, getting us all into debt, getting rid of local government,
[55:40.000 --> 55:46.000]  think about all the facets of it, the censorship, the surveillance.
[55:46.000 --> 55:50.000]  So I was taking care of an errand this morning, and I wasn't even close to downtown,
[55:50.000 --> 55:53.000]  but I was parked on the whole side street, going to this business.
[55:53.000 --> 55:59.000]  When I came back out, I saw what looked like two Asian folks, probably Chinese,
[55:59.000 --> 56:02.000]  walking down the sidewalk about 50 yards up ahead of me,
[56:02.000 --> 56:07.000]  and here I am parked a truck with the windows up, and the woman stops and points at me,
[56:07.000 --> 56:11.000]  so they stop and they wait while I'm inside my truck, truck started,
[56:11.000 --> 56:15.000]  and they sit there and stretch, she keeps pointing, and they put their hands out
[56:15.000 --> 56:21.000]  like they're waiting for me to go because I'm not wearing a mask inside my car.
[56:21.000 --> 56:25.000]  And so then I just sat there, so they acted angry and walked past me.
[56:25.000 --> 56:31.000]  I almost shot a video of it on my phone, but everybody sees this stuff happening everywhere.
[56:31.000 --> 56:35.000]  This is mental illness, people are pulling guns on folks that aren't wearing masks.
[56:35.000 --> 56:38.000]  This is all cult programming, this is all about submitting.
[56:38.000 --> 56:43.000]  We cannot submit to this UN brainwashing, it's all a giant fraud.
[56:43.000 --> 57:10.000]  We must expose the fraud or become slaves to it.
[57:13.000 --> 57:22.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[57:22.000 --> 57:25.000]  Well, Donald Trump is the most famous person in the world right now,
[57:25.000 --> 57:29.000]  I don't think anybody doubts that, and I had the title,
[57:29.000 --> 57:33.000]  when they were really demonizing me a few years ago, of the most infamous person.
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  Not a title that you want.
[57:35.000 --> 57:40.000]  Roger Stone now has the title of the most infamous person in America,
[57:40.000 --> 57:44.000]  at least in the leftist minds, and when we go out in public even a year ago,
[57:44.000 --> 57:47.000]  people try to attack him and I, screaming at us that we're Russian traders.
[57:47.000 --> 57:49.000]  So I was inviting him to Austin and he said,
[57:49.000 --> 57:52.000]  well, I probably can't leave my house, people are trying to kill me.
[57:52.000 --> 57:55.000]  And literally, folks, it was bad a year ago,
[57:55.000 --> 57:57.000]  because I had one of the same security guys, he did some work for Roger.
[57:57.000 --> 58:00.000]  He said they'd go to the grocery store, he'd shake 10 hands,
[58:00.000 --> 58:06.000]  and then somebody tried to throw a can of peas at him, screaming Russian, Russian, FU,
[58:06.000 --> 58:10.000]  people spitting on his steaks, just hellish behavior.
[58:10.000 --> 58:14.000]  And it's not he's a victim, it's talking about the derangement of these people.
[58:14.000 --> 58:17.000]  And now, Robert Mueller has come out from under his rock,
[58:17.000 --> 58:20.000]  there's all these articles, false quoting him from my show,
[58:20.000 --> 58:23.000]  Stone admitted on Jones' show, LA Times, New York Times,
[58:23.000 --> 58:27.000]  that he would be faithful and would not roll on the president,
[58:27.000 --> 58:31.000]  they left out the rest of the quote, because there is nothing to roll on him about,
[58:31.000 --> 58:34.000]  he did nothing, I did not talk to him about it.
[58:34.000 --> 58:38.000]  I was there, folks, I remember, everything Roger said was true.
[58:38.000 --> 58:42.000]  So, political president, Clemency, we're going to cover the waterfront in the next hour.
[58:42.000 --> 58:45.000]  Roger, let's talk about this first before we get into everything next segment.
[58:45.000 --> 58:50.000]  Talk about what it's like to be you now, the most infamous man in America.
[58:50.000 --> 58:53.000]  Well, it is both great and it's very bad.
[58:53.000 --> 58:56.000]  I mean, the point is, of course, that true patriots,
[58:56.000 --> 59:01.000]  and I think we are a slim majority in this country, realize that I did the right thing,
[59:01.000 --> 59:05.000]  realize that I was pressured, both legally and financially,
[59:05.000 --> 59:10.000]  to lie about the president, to bear false witness against him,
[59:10.000 --> 59:14.000]  to repeat testimony composed for me by the prosecutor,
[59:14.000 --> 59:17.000]  so they could use it to impeach Donald Trump.
[59:17.000 --> 59:19.000]  The timing here is very important.
[59:19.000 --> 59:24.000]  It happens just before the release of the Mueller report, which is a nothing burger.
[59:24.000 --> 59:27.000]  So, they're looking for me to be the ham in their ham sandwich,
[59:27.000 --> 59:30.000]  because they have nothing on the Russian collusion hoax,
[59:30.000 --> 59:35.000]  and they want me to essentially be their star witness.
[59:35.000 --> 59:42.000]  And they hint about leniency, and maybe the judge will let you go without any jail time, and so on.
[59:42.000 --> 59:47.000]  Now you have Andrew Weisman, who is the guy who really ought to be in front of the grand jury,
[59:47.000 --> 59:53.000]  an epitly corrupt former prosecutor, cited by federal judges in multiple cases for misconduct
[59:53.000 --> 59:58.000]  and for ethical problems, saying, oh, we can still get the truth out of Roger Stone.
[59:58.000 --> 1:00:01.000]  Believe me, Andrew, you had a search warrant.
[1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:04.000]  You went through all of my emails, all of my text messages,
[1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:07.000]  all of my phone messages, all of my paper records,
[1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  which you presumably grabbed when you raided my apartment and my office and my home,
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  and you found nothing, because there's nothing to find.
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  I know of no wrongdoing by the president of the United States.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  I know of no misconduct by the president of the United States.
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  Let me repeat it again.
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  By the way, you said that probably 500 times on my show, and then they misquote you and cut.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  I mean, this is really defamation when they even quote you on my show and go,
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  on Jones' show, he admits that he will not turn on the president,
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  because then you add it because there's nothing to say, there's nothing.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  That's exactly right.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  So it's a reinvention.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  First of all, we're all the way back to Goosefort 2.0, all right?
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  So Mueller says, Stone communicated with a Russian intelligence agent known to us.
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  Well, first of all, let's be very clear.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  My communications with Goosefort 2.0 on Twitter direct message, I made it public completely in 2017.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  It's benign.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  It took place after WikiLeaks had already published all of their material.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  And they used that to say you perjured yourself as you talked to somebody that might have seen a Russian once.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  Well, what they're claiming is that he's a Russian intelligence agent.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  They haven't even proven that.
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  That comes from the demented mind of John Brennan.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  We don't know that.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  Stay there.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  Start over in 60 seconds, and let's walk through this.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  And I've been drawn into it.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  And a lot of these articles, they quote from my show,
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  Jones covering for him as an intermediary with Trump,
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  has Stone send the message that I'll cover up if you get rid of my sentence.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  No such thing happened, totally made up, more fraud, more criminal activity.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  And the New York Times and the LA Times will be right back with Roger Stone.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  You can add stimuli through the AI systems, through the computers,
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  through digital billboards, through face scanning,
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  through the social credit score to control people and make them act like you wanted to.
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  But when we cover that, the media would attack us and say,
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  we were making it up.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  It was a conspiracy theory, even though it was in the actual corporate level blueprint documents.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  Well, the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control system to make humans obsolete
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  and phase us out.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  And it's something about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned.
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  So we might want to dismantle the system now.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  Music
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  Well, it's high noon, Central Texas time, broadcasting worldwide and Roger Stone
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  is giving us the first big in-depth interview.
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  Very honored, he went on Kennedy last night and let out a lot of important things.
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  But now he's here in the next 45 minutes or so in his own words to set the record straight
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  because they're still saying he's a Russian agent.
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  They're saying I'm a Russian agent in Congress with zero proof.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  They are...
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  Here's the New York Times.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  We can still get the truth from Roger Stone.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  They want him called back in before grand juries.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  They want him re-indicted.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  New York Times.
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  Shift.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  Anyone who cares about the rule of law in this country is nauseated by Stone's sentence computation.
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  Here it is, the executive grant of clemency and the seal right there of the Department of Justice
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  with the president's signature right there.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  And then you've got George Stepanophilus who presided over the Clintons and Obama
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  and all these criminal activities and pardons of drug dealers and money launderers and people.
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  But oh, that's okay.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  Have dims, outrage over Stone, computation forgotten to the Clintons and Obama's pardon.
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  Roger Stone has the floor.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  Right now, Roger, plow into it and why it's more important than ever.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  And it's, by the way, good to see you there as a free man.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  Well, it's great to be free because, as you know, the judge in my case was intent in sending me to a COVID-19 infested prison.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  There are now 60 confirmed cases of COVID at that prison.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  I'm 67 years old.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  She's seen all my health records because you have to file them in your pre-sentence period.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  This was a death sentence.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  There's no question.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  You would have been in jail.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  You would have been in jail right now.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  You have been in prison right now.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  That is correct.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  Today.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  Today was the day.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  So the president's commutation needs to be viewed, I think, first and foremost as a humanitarian act of mercy because I wouldn't have lived long enough to pursue my appeal.
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  I want to clear my name and I want to expose the epic corruption that surrounds my trial by the prosecutors, by the jury, all of it.
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  And therefore, you know, I wouldn't live to get to an appeal if the deep state had their way.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  So I'm very grateful to God.
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  I'm very grateful to the president who, I believe, received divine guidance to do the right thing, although I think you would have done the right thing.
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  But I'm very grateful to both of them.
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  This was a death match, Alex.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  This was a death penalty.
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  They want to silence me and, above all, they want me off the battlefield in 2020.
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  They want to make sure that I was locked up someplace in ill health, maybe even kill me before the election, so that I couldn't do anything to aid the president in his reelection bid.
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  This is the last grasp by the globalists.
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  They want to grab it all and take it back.
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:06:00.000]  That's what this was really about.
[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  And the notion that I had some detrimental information that I knew of misconduct or illegal activity by the president and that I covered it up or lied about it in return for an act of clemency is a bald-faced lie.
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  Robert Mueller is saying it. Andrew Weissman, his pit bull, who's more like a French poodle, if you ask me, and Rod Rosenstein.
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  This guy, Rosenstein, is really clever.
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  He takes a quote out of Mueller's screed in the Washington Post, and then he selectively edits it.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  So it's no longer, Stone was in touch with a Russian intelligence officer known to us, it now becomes, Stone was in touch with a known Russian intelligence agent.
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  You see the difference?
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  It implies that I knowingly reached out to someone who was a Russian intelligence officer, which, of course, I didn't.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  This is a recap of an entirely benign narrative in which, after the publication of all the WikiLeaks documents, I had a perfectly benign exchange with Guccifer 2.0 on Twitter direct message.
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  It's a persona.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  Now, if you look at the content of all those messages, there's no evidence of collaboration or collusion or cooperation.
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:32.000]  It's benign, and it happened after the fact, and that's the only communication there is.
[1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  So it's proof of nothing, number one, based on timing and content.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  And then the assertion that this entity is a Russian intelligence agent, that's a claim of John Brennan and the CIA.
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  Why would we believe it?
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  We've seen no proof of it.
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  In fact, if you go to stonecoastroof.com, my website, I've written, and others have written, thousands of words to demonstrate that the forensic evidence is much to the contrary.
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  Most likely, Guccifer 2.0 is actually a U.S. intelligence asset.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  So this whole narrative is being recycled, whether it's Adam Schiff, a guy who can't tell the truth if it would save his life, whether it is Rod Rosenstein, whether it is Robert Mueller, now Andrew Weissman.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  Weissman says, let's drag stone in front of a grand jury.
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  Now, I've got a better idea.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  Let's drag Andrew Weissman in front of a grand jury, because they are busted.
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  The documents that were declassified through the heroic efforts of Rick Grinnell only weeks ago proved beyond dispute that the entire Russian collusion thing was a hoax.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  Prove within an absolute certainty that the entire thing was based on illegitimate, fraudulent, fabricated information paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats, and assembled with the cooperation and the assistance of Russian intelligence.
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  There is the real Russian collusion right there.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  So in my view, Andrew Weissman should be indicted for sedition and for treason.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  It's time for them to get him in front of the grand jury.
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  Hopefully, John Durham is going to do that.
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  I have my doubts, but I'm still praying for it, and who knows, it might happen.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  And everything you said is true and on record.
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  It's come out that Hillary knew it was Russians.
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  It's incredible how they turned everything around on us.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  It really is, but it is also something I've never experienced in politics.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  In other words, the way it used to work is somebody would make a charge against you.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  You would respond.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  You'd document that you were telling the truth and we would move on.
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  These people keep recycling the same old BS again and again and again.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  And they're smart enough to know that most people just read the headline.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  You just hit the key.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  Let me explain this.
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  You were on record on my show talking about talking to Goose for 2.0 and trying to find out if they could talk to WikiLeaks or if they had any information.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  Everybody was doing it.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  Nothing wrong with that.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  Then years later, years later, it's on the news.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  I'm going from my memory.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  On the news breaking.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  He was talking to Goose for like it was brand new when you brought it out at the time.
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  I released the entire exchange to the press in 2017.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  I was the first person.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  That's what I'm saying.
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  But even this year, they were bringing it out like it was some new thing.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  That's what you're saying is they just, they know people don't have a memory.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  That's right.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  So they go for the headline.
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  Trump associate admits contact with Russian intelligence agent.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  It's completely bogus.
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  It's false.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  It was false then.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  It's false now.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  But they don't understand how thin it wears on the American people.
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  There's no evidence of Russian collusion.
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  There's no evidence of Russian assistance to the Trump campaign.
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  It's a fantasy.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  It's a fraud.
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  It's a canard.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  I want to get back to what you just brought up since you went there.
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  Durham, the investigation, the attempted coup on the president.
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  You were the linchpin of that.
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  It's all failed.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  But now they're back with new frauds and new hoaxes, new coups because they haven't gotten
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  trouble.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  What needs to happen now?
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  Well, I mean, that's an excellent question.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  First of all, I don't understand why this is taking so long.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  First, they were telling us that Durham would have a report in the spring, then it's the
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  summer.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  Now they're saying maybe it'll be next year.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  Well, next year we may or may not have a different president.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  You know, hopefully we will have the same president because he's the only one who can revive
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  this economy.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  How do I know that?
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  He's already done it once.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  A man who knows how to bring back the economy when everybody said it was hopeless.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:40.400]  A man who gave us the strongest economy in our history, the strongest job growth, the
[1:11:40.400 --> 1:11:44.760]  strongest wage growth, the highest levels of employment, there's no question he knows
[1:11:44.760 --> 1:11:45.760]  how to do it.
[1:11:45.760 --> 1:11:47.160]  He's already done it once.
[1:11:47.160 --> 1:11:52.000]  Your alternative is a guy whose prescription will make the sick patient even sicker.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:58.520]  Higher taxes, more regulation, big one-size-fits-all international trade deals that steal our
[1:11:58.520 --> 1:11:59.520]  jobs.
[1:11:59.520 --> 1:12:00.760]  Do we really want to go back to that?
[1:12:00.760 --> 1:12:03.080]  We know what it got us under Obama.
[1:12:03.080 --> 1:12:07.520]  So I really think this is a clear-cut choice for the voters, but this is going to be a
[1:12:07.520 --> 1:12:10.760]  very, very tough, hard-fought election.
[1:12:10.760 --> 1:12:16.240]  And they are hoping that Durham will report nothing and that Joe Biden as president can
[1:12:16.240 --> 1:12:17.440]  sweep it under the rug.
[1:12:17.440 --> 1:12:18.440]  And again...
[1:12:18.440 --> 1:12:19.440]  I mean, another point.
[1:12:19.440 --> 1:12:25.240]  Bill Barr has gotten two recommendations, referrals from two different Inspector General's
[1:12:25.240 --> 1:12:30.760]  reports, recommending the indictment of James Comey for crimes that are far more serious
[1:12:30.760 --> 1:12:31.760]  than what I was charged with.
[1:12:31.760 --> 1:12:33.320]  Roger, let's leave it off there.
[1:12:33.320 --> 1:12:36.320]  Let's come back and get right into that.
[1:12:36.320 --> 1:12:40.760]  Roger's on fire and his Skype is super clear, so he's right here in studio with us in Austin,
[1:12:40.760 --> 1:12:41.760]  but he's not.
[1:12:41.760 --> 1:12:42.760]  He's in Florida.
[1:12:42.760 --> 1:12:43.760]  Tell everybody you know.
[1:12:43.760 --> 1:12:44.760]  Tune in.
[1:12:44.760 --> 1:12:45.760]  This is history.
[1:12:45.760 --> 1:12:46.760]  They wanted this man in prison and silenced.
[1:12:46.760 --> 1:12:49.760]  To be the lynchpin that cherry on top of their whole fraud instead it blew up in their
[1:12:49.760 --> 1:12:50.760]  face.
[1:12:50.760 --> 1:12:51.760]  Thank God.
[1:12:51.760 --> 1:12:57.000]  Much of the United States bureaucracy, all of Hollywood and most of our media is under
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:59.040]  international banking control.
[1:12:59.040 --> 1:13:03.240]  The United Nations was set up by the Rothschilds and Rockefellers on record to carry out this
[1:13:03.240 --> 1:13:04.240]  operation.
[1:13:04.240 --> 1:13:11.280]  Now, under the guise of medical security, they're bringing us medical charity that we see much
[1:13:11.280 --> 1:13:15.160]  of the federal government, the Democrats, the Republicans, all saying except for Trump
[1:13:15.160 --> 1:13:22.000]  and a few people that we need a nationwide force mask mandate to make everyone wear a
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  mask.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:26.600]  Even though just months ago, we had the Surgeon General and others say don't wear a mask.
[1:13:26.600 --> 1:13:27.600]  It's all a fraud.
[1:13:27.600 --> 1:13:29.800]  Now they say you must wear a mask.
[1:13:29.800 --> 1:13:30.800]  It's a sign of slavery.
[1:13:30.800 --> 1:13:32.400]  It's a sign of submission.
[1:13:32.400 --> 1:13:34.440]  I know you as listeners understand that.
[1:13:34.440 --> 1:13:38.560]  We need sheriffs and county commissures and city councils and others to stand up and say
[1:13:38.560 --> 1:13:44.680]  we are sanctuary cities for reality and for state and local sovereignty against the
[1:13:44.680 --> 1:13:45.680]  globalist.
[1:13:45.680 --> 1:13:47.360]  This isn't the federal government taking over.
[1:13:47.360 --> 1:13:51.680]  It's the UN through the federal government and we as American citizens must say no.
[1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:55.800]  There are many reasons that the globalist launched this planetary lockdown.
[1:13:55.800 --> 1:14:00.040]  But the number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes.
[1:14:00.040 --> 1:14:05.000]  We've gone over those purposes many times here on air.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:09.360]  The casual society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, forced
[1:14:09.360 --> 1:14:10.360]  inoculation.
[1:14:10.360 --> 1:14:18.080]  But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential
[1:14:18.080 --> 1:14:24.640]  as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people
[1:14:24.640 --> 1:14:26.640]  once had by design.
[1:14:26.640 --> 1:14:31.440]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[1:14:31.440 --> 1:14:36.800]  It's been preplanned, organized globally and it's extremely predatory.
[1:14:36.800 --> 1:14:42.200]  And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks
[1:14:42.200 --> 1:14:48.680]  that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[1:14:48.680 --> 1:15:17.680]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[1:15:18.680 --> 1:15:42.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are here broadcasting worldwide today.
[1:15:42.240 --> 1:15:44.120]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[1:15:44.120 --> 1:15:46.920]  Roger Stone is here with us exclusively for the rest of the hour.
[1:15:46.920 --> 1:15:48.720]  This is his first big in-depth interview.
[1:15:48.720 --> 1:15:51.560]  We're very thankful for him being here with us today.
[1:15:51.560 --> 1:15:57.040]  He's wearing his Roger Stone still did nothing wrong shirt and his free Roger Stone COVID-19
[1:15:57.040 --> 1:15:58.040]  mask.
[1:15:58.040 --> 1:16:01.520]  Roger, getting back to this, we've been hearing for years, two weeks, two weeks, there's going
[1:16:01.520 --> 1:16:05.080]  to be indictments, two weeks, two weeks, the deep state's going to be punished, but instead
[1:16:05.080 --> 1:16:06.080]  we haven't seen that.
[1:16:06.080 --> 1:16:11.560]  Now we've seen Manafort finally sent to home confinement after he did nothing wrong.
[1:16:11.560 --> 1:16:15.920]  We've seen you getting clemency and we hear calls for Trump's impeachment.
[1:16:15.920 --> 1:16:20.240]  I think President Trump needs to get on the offense here as you've been talking about with
[1:16:20.240 --> 1:16:24.400]  his bully pulpit and keep exposing these people or they're going to try for another cool attempt
[1:16:24.400 --> 1:16:25.400]  on the president.
[1:16:25.400 --> 1:16:32.560]  Well, Alex, first of all, now like General Flynn, I am unmasked, not quite the same
[1:16:32.560 --> 1:16:34.560]  way he was.
[1:16:34.560 --> 1:16:35.880]  You know, you're absolutely right.
[1:16:35.880 --> 1:16:41.920]  And the president's comments since he commuted my sentence have been right on the money.
[1:16:41.920 --> 1:16:46.640]  The investigation under which I was prosecuted was illegitimate.
[1:16:46.640 --> 1:16:49.720]  So how can my prosecution be legitimate?
[1:16:49.720 --> 1:16:53.120]  This is the classic fruit of the poison tree.
[1:16:53.120 --> 1:17:01.320]  And it is interesting that they only approved the investigation into me in October of 2017.
[1:17:01.320 --> 1:17:05.320]  After three months, after they knew, there was no Russian collusion.
[1:17:05.320 --> 1:17:09.480]  There was no collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian state.
[1:17:09.480 --> 1:17:12.720]  It even proves beyond the shadow of a doubt.
[1:17:12.720 --> 1:17:16.280]  This is the guy, Nick Ackerman, by the way, writing for the New York Times, I'm going
[1:17:16.280 --> 1:17:17.480]  to be suing him.
[1:17:17.480 --> 1:17:19.760]  He called me a Russian spy and a traitor.
[1:17:19.760 --> 1:17:24.520]  You know, even Roger Stone can be defamed and there is no such proof.
[1:17:24.520 --> 1:17:27.560]  He is the most irresponsible of all my critics.
[1:17:27.560 --> 1:17:30.160]  He's a former Watergate prosecutor.
[1:17:30.160 --> 1:17:33.480]  He has gone on TV to say, Nixon knew about the break in.
[1:17:33.480 --> 1:17:34.480]  We just couldn't find it.
[1:17:34.480 --> 1:17:37.040]  Well, that means you have no proof of that claim.
[1:17:37.040 --> 1:17:39.400]  It happens, by the way, to be false.
[1:17:39.400 --> 1:17:44.600]  But just like in my situation, let's be clear, Andrew Weissman and the special counsels,
[1:17:44.600 --> 1:17:51.320]  Aaron Zelinski, the guy who basically defrauded a House Judiciary Committee whose testimony
[1:17:51.320 --> 1:17:55.200]  before the committee, he wouldn't show up in person because he's very concerned about
[1:17:55.200 --> 1:18:00.280]  catching COVID, but he has no problems with my going to a COVID-invested prison.
[1:18:00.280 --> 1:18:06.360]  This guy's testimony was the most incredible blend of obfuscation, perjury, and hearsay
[1:18:06.360 --> 1:18:07.840]  I've ever heard.
[1:18:07.840 --> 1:18:13.400]  Oh, somebody told me the Attorney General was under pressure to give Stone special treatment.
[1:18:13.400 --> 1:18:15.680]  Well, Mr. Zelinski, who is somebody?
[1:18:15.680 --> 1:18:16.680]  Who told you?
[1:18:16.680 --> 1:18:18.000]  What person told you?
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:22.200]  It was really, it was very slimy and the guy had no proof whatsoever.
[1:18:22.200 --> 1:18:23.920]  That's because it didn't happen.
[1:18:23.920 --> 1:18:28.080]  Alex, you're in a situation where the president keeps pounding on this.
[1:18:28.080 --> 1:18:29.280]  He says it every time.
[1:18:29.280 --> 1:18:31.040]  He's defended his action.
[1:18:31.040 --> 1:18:33.400]  In my case, he has said that he did the right thing.
[1:18:33.400 --> 1:18:34.400]  He's right.
[1:18:34.400 --> 1:18:36.840]  He has said that his supporters strongly support it.
[1:18:36.840 --> 1:18:37.840]  They do.
[1:18:37.840 --> 1:18:45.160]  I don't think there's a single voter out there who says, well, I was going to vote for Donald
[1:18:45.160 --> 1:18:49.480]  Trump, but now that he's saved Roger Stone's life, I'm not going to.
[1:18:49.480 --> 1:18:52.160]  Not a single voter, not one.
[1:18:52.160 --> 1:18:56.760]  The outrage here from the left is they really thought they could get me off the battlefield
[1:18:56.760 --> 1:18:58.360]  in 2020.
[1:18:58.360 --> 1:19:02.640]  They really thought that they could pay me back for the exposure of Hillary Clinton
[1:19:02.640 --> 1:19:07.840]  in my book, The Clinton's War on Women, which was, I think, a very important milestone
[1:19:07.840 --> 1:19:15.040]  in 2016, that you and I were out pushing the Clinton rape t-shirts, pointing out that Bill
[1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:21.240]  Clinton is a serial rapist, a serial sexual assault for a woman, but more importantly,
[1:19:21.240 --> 1:19:27.200]  it was Hillary Clinton who was intimidating and bullying these women into silence.
[1:19:27.200 --> 1:19:33.120]  It was Hillary Clinton who hired the heavy-handed detectives and the nasty lawyers to threaten
[1:19:33.120 --> 1:19:34.120]  these women.
[1:19:34.120 --> 1:19:39.720]  And by the way, they got really mad when we paid to send people, people got $2,000 prizes
[1:19:39.720 --> 1:19:42.080]  who would go scream your rapist to Bill Clinton's face.
[1:19:42.080 --> 1:19:43.520]  That happened hundreds of times.
[1:19:43.520 --> 1:19:48.080]  So this was about payback, and it's also about threatening anybody in the future.
[1:19:48.080 --> 1:19:49.400]  You better not support Trump.
[1:19:49.400 --> 1:19:50.800]  You better not advise him.
[1:19:50.800 --> 1:19:54.880]  Now we have the Council on Foreign Relations, the Washington Post, last week saying when
[1:19:54.880 --> 1:19:59.440]  he loses, if he contests the election, which Democrats are going to contest it, then we
[1:19:59.440 --> 1:20:03.080]  need the military to remove him, and anybody that doesn't follow our orders in the deep
[1:20:03.080 --> 1:20:05.800]  state, you will go to prison.
[1:20:05.800 --> 1:20:06.800]  That's the Washington Post.
[1:20:06.800 --> 1:20:13.200]  So now this coup hasn't gotten in trouble, so now they're just spoiling for an all-out
[1:20:13.200 --> 1:20:14.200]  military coup.
[1:20:14.200 --> 1:20:18.720]  I mean, Trump and others, how can Trump move against them if he doesn't have the Justice
[1:20:18.720 --> 1:20:19.720]  Department doing the right thing?
[1:20:19.720 --> 1:20:22.880]  I mean, does the Justice Department realize the danger of an all-out civil war, if they
[1:20:22.880 --> 1:20:25.240]  let the deep state keep doing this, this is dangerous?
[1:20:25.240 --> 1:20:30.320]  Well, I mean, why is Aaron Zelensky working for the Trump Justice Department?
[1:20:30.320 --> 1:20:35.240]  You know, after he finished his persecution, not prosecution, persecution of me, he returns
[1:20:35.240 --> 1:20:39.280]  to his job as an assistant U.S. attorney in Baltimore.
[1:20:39.280 --> 1:20:43.720]  This guy needs to be, not only fired, but he needs to be prosecuted in the Papadopoulos
[1:20:43.720 --> 1:20:47.800]  matter where he clearly engaged in gross and provable misconduct.
[1:20:47.800 --> 1:20:51.920]  And there are issues, in my case as well, that will come up down the road when I file
[1:20:51.920 --> 1:20:53.360]  some complaints.
[1:20:53.360 --> 1:20:58.000]  But why are any of these people still working for the Trump Justice Department?
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:03.240]  This is the problem with not cleaning house as soon as he became president.
[1:21:03.240 --> 1:21:07.880]  You know, changing the cabinet officer, but leaving everybody under them in place, is
[1:21:07.880 --> 1:21:12.080]  like leaving a dirty diaper on a baby, but changing the pins.
[1:21:12.080 --> 1:21:17.840]  It doesn't make any sense, and you've had, you know, many sectors of the Trump administration
[1:21:17.840 --> 1:21:20.640]  working against the president actively.
[1:21:20.640 --> 1:21:27.040]  You saw this in the Ukrainian scam put together hastily by Adam Schiff.
[1:21:27.040 --> 1:21:32.280]  Once they figured out they're rushing collusion scam, crashed and burned, it was going nowhere
[1:21:32.280 --> 1:21:37.640]  because it was a fraud, then they hastily put together this Ukrainian nonsense.
[1:21:37.640 --> 1:21:39.320]  Who's testifying against the president?
[1:21:39.320 --> 1:21:42.720]  All of his own employees, all of his own appointees.
[1:21:42.720 --> 1:21:45.320]  These people are all in political appointee jobs.
[1:21:45.320 --> 1:21:46.720]  They're not bureaucrats.
[1:21:46.720 --> 1:21:47.720]  They're not civil servants.
[1:21:47.720 --> 1:21:48.720]  Roger, let me ask you this.
[1:21:48.720 --> 1:21:49.720]  They're state senators.
[1:21:49.720 --> 1:21:51.720]  How do you expect them to strike back at the president?
[1:21:51.720 --> 1:21:56.040]  I mean, so far they're demonizing red states and praising blue states and blaming Cobra
[1:21:56.040 --> 1:21:57.040]  and the president.
[1:21:57.040 --> 1:21:58.040]  That's asinine.
[1:21:58.040 --> 1:22:00.480]  So far they're trying to hurt the economy, keep things shut to do that.
[1:22:00.480 --> 1:22:02.000]  They admit that's their plan.
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:04.040]  How else are they going to come at him, do you think?
[1:22:04.040 --> 1:22:06.720]  Well, I mean, we have anarchy in the streets.
[1:22:06.720 --> 1:22:09.200]  You show better footage of it than anybody does.
[1:22:09.200 --> 1:22:14.440]  We have a situation in which law-abiding citizens are afraid to leave their home.
[1:22:14.440 --> 1:22:18.680]  Now they're afraid to defend their homes because they might be indicted for it.
[1:22:18.680 --> 1:22:23.840]  The prosecutor seem to be on the side of the radicals rather than on the side of the citizens.
[1:22:23.840 --> 1:22:24.840]  It's very scary.
[1:22:24.840 --> 1:22:29.280]  Incredible interviews with Tucker Carlson last night from the couple that defended
[1:22:29.280 --> 1:22:31.920]  their own home with their legal firearms.
[1:22:31.920 --> 1:22:34.840]  And now got raided by the police, and now got raided.
[1:22:34.840 --> 1:22:35.840]  Unbelievable.
[1:22:35.840 --> 1:22:36.840]  Yeah.
[1:22:36.840 --> 1:22:42.760]  Well, obviously Soros has put in hundreds of county attorneys and city attorneys, district
[1:22:42.760 --> 1:22:43.760]  attorneys.
[1:22:43.760 --> 1:22:47.760]  He's put in hundreds and hundreds of police chiefs and mayors, and he's like the real
[1:22:47.760 --> 1:22:49.080]  shadow president.
[1:22:49.080 --> 1:22:51.320]  He brags now that he's got control of most cities.
[1:22:51.320 --> 1:22:53.840]  I mean, are we just going to let Soros do this?
[1:22:53.840 --> 1:22:56.600]  Why the hell is Soros so powerful?
[1:22:56.600 --> 1:22:57.600]  It's an excellent question.
[1:22:57.600 --> 1:22:59.920]  I was on Fox not long ago.
[1:22:59.920 --> 1:23:00.920]  We're doing an interview.
[1:23:00.920 --> 1:23:02.840]  I'm not going to tell you with whom.
[1:23:02.840 --> 1:23:07.320]  And just before we went on in my earpiece, the producer came on and said, oh, one more
[1:23:07.320 --> 1:23:12.920]  thing, Mr. Stone, under no circumstances can you mention George Soros.
[1:23:12.920 --> 1:23:14.720]  And I said, well, I wasn't going to.
[1:23:14.720 --> 1:23:17.880]  It's not related to the topic I'm here to discuss.
[1:23:17.880 --> 1:23:20.760]  And they said, well, we just wanted you to understand our policy.
[1:23:20.760 --> 1:23:22.480]  Now, this makes no sense to me.
[1:23:22.480 --> 1:23:24.920]  I cannot explain why that would be the case.
[1:23:24.920 --> 1:23:27.440]  Well, he's untouchable.
[1:23:27.440 --> 1:23:29.600]  And that's exactly what I've been told about people at Fox.
[1:23:29.600 --> 1:23:30.720]  We're going to come back.
[1:23:30.720 --> 1:23:34.520]  Let's talk about, though, your personal life, where you're going, why we need to get you
[1:23:34.520 --> 1:23:36.400]  vindicated with the clemency.
[1:23:36.400 --> 1:23:40.840]  And let's also talk about your personal relationship with Jesus Christ and how God's help bring
[1:23:40.840 --> 1:23:41.840]  you through this.
[1:23:41.840 --> 1:23:44.920]  Roger Stone is with us with for two more segments.
[1:23:44.920 --> 1:23:45.920]  This is historic.
[1:23:45.920 --> 1:23:46.920]  Oh, it's happened.
[1:23:46.920 --> 1:23:51.160]  And I want to thank the listeners for supporting Roger Stone because we're all in this together.
[1:23:51.160 --> 1:23:56.400]  Imagine telling someone just a year ago that in the middle of 2020, the Democrats, as well
[1:23:56.400 --> 1:24:02.160]  as many Republican leaders will be calling for the United Nations, WHO, edict that all
[1:24:02.160 --> 1:24:10.640]  Americans wear masks, be a quote, federal order and mandate, totally unconstitutional,
[1:24:10.640 --> 1:24:13.240]  annihilating states' rights.
[1:24:13.240 --> 1:24:14.240]  Think about that.
[1:24:14.240 --> 1:24:16.040]  A woman can kill her baby.
[1:24:16.040 --> 1:24:21.520]  You pay for illegal aliens' health care, but you've got to wear a mask for a virus that
[1:24:21.520 --> 1:24:27.240]  killed 20-plus times less than what they said, even if you believe the official story.
[1:24:27.240 --> 1:24:32.480]  This is about the WHO, the globalist, testing their power through the media, over the federal
[1:24:32.480 --> 1:24:35.880]  government, to set policy in the United States.
[1:24:35.880 --> 1:24:40.480]  This is our punishment for not going with the carbon taxes and the Paris Accord and
[1:24:40.480 --> 1:24:41.480]  all of it.
[1:24:41.480 --> 1:24:42.480]  And by the way, they admit that.
[1:24:42.480 --> 1:24:50.480]  They say, now your carbon's down, one way or another, you stupid Americans.
[1:24:50.480 --> 1:24:58.400]  It's finally here, introducing the new survival shield X2 Spray, available now for 33 percent

[1:27:12.520 --> 1:27:17.200]  And then we have the War Room, the War Room with Owen Schreuer and formerly Roger Stone,
[1:27:17.200 --> 1:27:20.080]  but he became a political prisoner.
[1:27:20.080 --> 1:27:25.400]  They swat-teamed him, helicopters, attack boats, stole everything he had, lost his
[1:27:25.400 --> 1:27:30.320]  house, spent $3 million, battling all the lawsuits, all the subpoenas, not just the
[1:27:30.320 --> 1:27:35.760]  criminal stuff, and believe me, folks, we have fought over 50 Democratic Party lawsuits,
[1:27:35.760 --> 1:27:42.280]  knocked out 43 of them, and we have the Georgetown University Democratic Party, all
[1:27:42.280 --> 1:27:47.280]  officially trying to destroy us, and they just keep with judges going, give us the
[1:27:47.280 --> 1:27:50.960]  secret documents where you're funded by the Russians, give us the secret documents with
[1:27:50.960 --> 1:27:57.800]  the Mercers, give us who commands you, who writes your scripts, who writes my scripts.
[1:27:57.800 --> 1:27:58.800]  I want to digress.
[1:27:58.800 --> 1:28:02.920]  Roger Stone is about to do some major history here, and I've been hoping, as soon as he
[1:28:02.920 --> 1:28:06.120]  gets out from under this nightmare, he'll start co-hosting with Owen again, his co-host
[1:28:06.120 --> 1:28:09.120]  in the War Room, that Steve Bannon stole the name from.
[1:28:09.120 --> 1:28:13.000]  Again, folks, think about Steve Bannon, he reports everything we report six months later
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:18.320]  and then just pontificates around, I'm sick of it, and he lied and literally perjured
[1:28:18.320 --> 1:28:22.200]  himself before Congress to put Roger in prison, or he called the truth for Congress, perjured
[1:28:22.200 --> 1:28:25.480]  himself in the criminal trial before Judge Amy Berman Jackson.
[1:28:25.480 --> 1:28:33.680]  This has been a nightmare, dystopic tragedy, like a Greek tragedy, but we're living it.
[1:28:33.680 --> 1:28:36.680]  I had the FBI investigate my father.
[1:28:36.680 --> 1:28:40.720]  I had the Washington Post call up and say, your father's paying hush money for Roger
[1:28:40.720 --> 1:28:41.720]  Stone.
[1:28:41.720 --> 1:28:45.760]  I had to go see the FBI, I'm not supposed to get into all this, I'm just going to stop
[1:28:45.760 --> 1:28:46.760]  here.
[1:28:46.760 --> 1:28:52.000]  I'm not a victim, I'm a target, but let me tell you, my family killed Russians, okay,
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:53.600]  in Latin America and stuff.
[1:28:53.600 --> 1:28:56.760]  I'm 1776, everybody knows that, okay?
[1:28:56.760 --> 1:28:59.040]  This whole idea is ridiculous.
[1:28:59.040 --> 1:29:03.440]  Roger Stone is a famous right winger that came out of Nixon.
[1:29:03.440 --> 1:29:07.000]  He helped round up a Russian spiring in Washington in the 80s.
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:08.920]  He's famous for that.
[1:29:08.920 --> 1:29:15.400]  It's like saying Clark Kent works for Lex Luthor or, I mean, it's just over the top,
[1:29:15.400 --> 1:29:16.400]  but they just keep doing it.
[1:29:16.400 --> 1:29:20.520]  So Roger, you've been inside M4 Wars, you've seen the guts of it, you've seen the operation.
[1:29:20.520 --> 1:29:23.680]  Is anyone telling us what to say or what to do?
[1:29:23.680 --> 1:29:28.600]  You can obviously tell Alex that we were all completely and totally unscripted, and there
[1:29:28.600 --> 1:29:32.720]  was no time that I worked there that you ever said to me, you can't say this, you can't
[1:29:32.720 --> 1:29:33.720]  say that.
[1:29:33.720 --> 1:29:37.440]  Now, you did tell me you didn't want to talk about Russia as much as I did, but I had no
[1:29:37.440 --> 1:29:41.240]  choice because I realized at that point it was their master plan.
[1:29:41.240 --> 1:29:42.240]  No, no, you were right.
[1:29:42.240 --> 1:29:43.240]  You were proven right.
[1:29:43.240 --> 1:29:44.240]  You were proven right.
[1:29:44.240 --> 1:29:46.840]  I started getting, we had to defend ourselves when they were criminally investigating me.
[1:29:46.840 --> 1:29:50.000]  I was like, oh, this is important now, yeah.
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:54.440]  So I'm going to do something very historic now, right on the air here at M4 Wars.
[1:29:54.440 --> 1:30:00.120]  I'm going to actually sign my acceptance of the commutation by the President of the United
[1:30:00.120 --> 1:30:01.120]  States.
[1:30:01.120 --> 1:30:02.120]  There you see it.
[1:30:02.120 --> 1:30:04.360]  It is not signed.
[1:30:04.360 --> 1:30:06.000]  This is a historic moment.
[1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:09.200]  This is the document that saves my life.
[1:30:09.200 --> 1:30:14.480]  It now has my signature on it, as you can see, and there it is.
[1:30:14.480 --> 1:30:22.440]  So I have accepted the act of mercy, the act of justice by a benevolent president, a man
[1:30:22.440 --> 1:30:27.520]  who believes deeply in justice, who believes in fairness, who knows I did not get a fair
[1:30:27.520 --> 1:30:34.160]  trial, who knows I was subjected to a Soviet style show trial before a kangaroo court wasn't
[1:30:34.160 --> 1:30:35.160]  a trial.
[1:30:35.160 --> 1:30:37.040]  It was morally moral, like a lynching.
[1:30:37.040 --> 1:30:38.880]  I mean, Owen Shroyer was there.
[1:30:38.880 --> 1:30:40.360]  He saw it with his own eyes.
[1:30:40.360 --> 1:30:42.760]  It was like a lynching.
[1:30:42.760 --> 1:30:44.240]  And you could see these jurors.
[1:30:44.240 --> 1:30:46.280]  You could see the hate in their eyes.
[1:30:46.280 --> 1:30:51.640]  You could see the joy in their eyes when the prosecutors, they even wrote op-eds bashing
[1:30:51.640 --> 1:30:52.640]  you.
[1:30:52.640 --> 1:30:53.640]  No jurors ever done that.
[1:30:53.640 --> 1:30:57.400]  They're in the Washington Post bashing you and I after you're convicted.
[1:30:57.400 --> 1:30:59.320]  But then we're not allowed to say their names.
[1:30:59.320 --> 1:31:02.400]  We're terrorizing them when we talk about it.
[1:31:02.400 --> 1:31:09.040]  The amazing thing is, when we raised the question of the jury for a woman's misconduct,
[1:31:09.040 --> 1:31:11.480]  the judge held a hearing.
[1:31:11.480 --> 1:31:16.040]  And in that hearing, she said, I'm not going to question the entire jury.
[1:31:16.040 --> 1:31:18.800]  I'm going to take a sampling of two jurors.
[1:31:18.800 --> 1:31:23.160]  And one of the two she selected was the juror who wrote the op-ed piece for the Washington
[1:31:23.160 --> 1:31:28.600]  Post talking about how everything was done perfectly right and that Stone was not a political
[1:31:28.600 --> 1:31:29.600]  hit.
[1:31:29.600 --> 1:31:30.600]  And the jury was diverse.
[1:31:30.600 --> 1:31:32.100]  Yeah, it was diverse.
[1:31:32.100 --> 1:31:37.400]  It was, you know, there were no Republicans, no libertarians, no independents, no working
[1:31:37.400 --> 1:31:40.720]  class people, no military veterans.
[1:31:40.720 --> 1:31:45.000]  It was a hanging jury and it was designed to be one.
[1:31:45.000 --> 1:31:51.240]  So it is good to know that we have a president who stands up for the rule of law.
[1:31:51.240 --> 1:31:56.680]  Seeing these Democrats like Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler and Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi
[1:31:56.680 --> 1:32:03.840]  running around talking about the rule of law, the rule of law, how about this, the abuse
[1:32:03.840 --> 1:32:09.480]  of power by Barack Obama's administration, including his national security advisor, his
[1:32:09.480 --> 1:32:16.680]  vice president, his national security advisor, his CIA director, his FBI director and a half
[1:32:16.680 --> 1:32:23.280]  a dozen other officials in his administration below him engaged in the use of the full authority
[1:32:23.280 --> 1:32:28.600]  of the United States government and the exceptional surveillance capabilities of our intelligence
[1:32:28.600 --> 1:32:35.560]  agencies to spy on the president of the United States, to defraud the bicep courts using
[1:32:35.560 --> 1:32:36.560] ...
[1:32:36.560 --> 1:32:40.600]  And by the way, Roger, remember, let's go back to early 2017.
[1:32:40.600 --> 1:32:49.240]  Me, you and I, it's not about bragging, it's about facts, pioneered, pioneered, exposing
[1:32:49.240 --> 1:32:52.520]  how he was being spied on, how they were doing it, the fires of court from your sources
[1:32:52.520 --> 1:32:55.840]  and my sources, that also drove them into a total rage.
[1:32:55.840 --> 1:33:01.920]  I remember how they vilified Judge Andrew Napolitano, my longtime friend, I've known
[1:33:01.920 --> 1:33:04.120]  him for almost 40 years.
[1:33:04.120 --> 1:33:05.800]  They vilified him when he said that.
[1:33:05.800 --> 1:33:10.440]  You know, nobody comes back and says, later, gee, Judge, we apologize, you were right.
[1:33:10.440 --> 1:33:16.800]  The guy took a weekend off and the fake news media says Napolitano's been fired from Fox.
[1:33:16.800 --> 1:33:21.120]  This man has more integrity in his little finger than the New York Times has in every
[1:33:21.120 --> 1:33:22.840]  single employee they have.
[1:33:22.840 --> 1:33:26.680]  Roger, let's talk big picture before we gotta go to break and come back and play Hillary
[1:33:26.680 --> 1:33:30.400]  Attack to you on Trevor Noah, The Not Funny Show and all the rest of it.
[1:33:30.400 --> 1:33:34.480]  I know you lost your nice house, I know your finances, I know you basically don't have
[1:33:34.480 --> 1:33:35.480]  any money.
[1:33:35.480 --> 1:33:42.680]  You have spent what, $3 million on lawyers and so that's what I thought, estimated.
[1:33:42.680 --> 1:33:46.240]  And so I understand that you really, really need people's support.
[1:33:46.240 --> 1:33:50.400]  They should all buy a Roger Stone, still did nothing wrong, the ultimate triggering shirt
[1:33:50.400 --> 1:33:54.000]  on your website and want to thank all the listeners that did donate to you.
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:58.640]  How do people continue to support in this critical fight to really up in the deep state?
[1:33:58.640 --> 1:34:01.560]  And then separately, let's talk about who really gets the credit.
[1:34:01.560 --> 1:34:07.400]  You with Billy Graham's son and going to that crusade and really, you already knew Christ
[1:34:07.400 --> 1:34:10.480]  but really finding Christ against stronger than ever, putting your faith in Christ and
[1:34:10.480 --> 1:34:13.920]  how the tide totally turned once you did that.
[1:34:13.920 --> 1:34:17.640]  Absolutely Alex, you almost don't know where to start.
[1:34:17.640 --> 1:34:22.440]  The first thing they do in one of these processes is they break you financially so you no longer
[1:34:22.440 --> 1:34:24.480]  have the resources to fight them.
[1:34:24.480 --> 1:34:25.760]  So you're right, I've lost everything.
[1:34:25.760 --> 1:34:31.400]  I've lost my home, I've lost one of my cars, I lost most of my insurance, I lost my savings
[1:34:31.400 --> 1:34:36.720]  and for 16 months I've been unable to work because essentially I work by speaking and
[1:34:36.720 --> 1:34:41.920]  writing and I was gagged and the only thing people were interested in speaking and writing,
[1:34:41.920 --> 1:34:46.680]  having me speak and write about were my trial and my ordeal, which I was prohibited from
[1:34:46.680 --> 1:34:47.680]  doing.
[1:34:47.680 --> 1:34:49.280]  So yes, I've lost everything.
[1:34:49.280 --> 1:34:58.760]  Those who want to help me can go to stonefamilyfund.com, that's for groceries, that's for gasoline,
[1:34:58.760 --> 1:35:03.120]  that's for utilities, that's for medical expenses and prescription drugs.
[1:35:03.120 --> 1:35:08.040]  Folks, I am not living a lavish lifestyle high on the hog.
[1:35:08.040 --> 1:35:15.000]  So if you want to help us again, stonefamilyfund.com and believe me, it will be a godsend because
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:18.360]  I got to worry about the rent next month.
[1:35:18.360 --> 1:35:22.840]  If you want to get this t-shirt or any other of the Roger Stone paraphernalia, you can
[1:35:22.840 --> 1:35:27.320]  go to fightback.store, that's fightback.store.
[1:35:27.320 --> 1:35:30.840]  And by the way, the guy that makes your shirts got banned on Facebook and lost a bunch of
[1:35:30.840 --> 1:35:34.640]  his accounts, they're harassing everyone and you've still got to go through clemency, you've
[1:35:34.640 --> 1:35:38.680]  still got to go to the Court of Appeals to overturn this monster, Amy Berman Jackson,
[1:35:38.680 --> 1:35:43.040]  or they're going to keep saying that you were really convicted of working with the Russians.
[1:35:43.040 --> 1:35:46.640]  It's true, I have an appeal which needs to be funded and therefore if you want to help
[1:35:46.640 --> 1:35:55.240]  me in that epic struggle, you can go to stonedefencefund.com, that's stonedefencefund.com.
[1:35:55.240 --> 1:35:56.240]  There it is.
[1:35:56.240 --> 1:36:00.520]  Let's talk about Christ though because I mean, how did things change when you did that?
[1:36:00.520 --> 1:36:01.840]  Overnight, literally overnight.
[1:36:01.840 --> 1:36:06.680]  I had an opportunity to meet Reverend Franklin Graham, I jumped at it, he gave me the most
[1:36:06.680 --> 1:36:09.000]  solid advice you could give anybody.
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:14.600]  He said, you're right son, you're in big trouble, but if you will just confess your sins, if
[1:36:14.600 --> 1:36:21.200]  you will be reborn, if you will get right with Christ, if you will reaffirm your commitment
[1:36:21.200 --> 1:36:25.000]  to the Lord, you will see, he will protect you.
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:29.840]  He will never abandon you, he will be with you in your moment of need, and you can erase
[1:36:29.840 --> 1:36:33.240]  all worry and you no longer need to be afraid.
[1:36:33.240 --> 1:36:38.880]  That very day I did what Reverend Graham suggested, I stood up with 500 others, I confessed my
[1:36:38.880 --> 1:36:44.480]  sins and I pledged to sin no more to the best of my ability, and Alex, that was a Saturday.
[1:36:44.480 --> 1:36:45.480]  On Monday morning-
[1:36:45.480 --> 1:36:46.480]  Stay there, let's talk about it.
[1:36:46.480 --> 1:36:47.480]  Let's go on the story.
[1:36:47.480 --> 1:36:48.480]  Gotta go to break.
[1:36:48.480 --> 1:36:49.480]  Stay there, we'll finish up.
[1:36:49.480 --> 1:36:55.520]  This is the mega-opolis technology plan, things are going to be so incredibly fair and wonderful
[1:36:55.520 --> 1:37:01.720]  because an all-seeing, all-loving computer that doesn't discriminate is going to decide
[1:37:01.720 --> 1:37:07.000]  who gets what resources, who gets what jobs, but in reality it's building a post-human
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:15.400]  world so that you can be made obsolete, domesticated, dumbed down, drugged, distracted, atomized,
[1:37:15.400 --> 1:37:18.200]  and then slowly killed.
[1:37:18.200 --> 1:37:24.640]  This is the brave new world, it's the post-human world, it's the dreaming of the post-human
[1:37:24.640 --> 1:37:29.920]  world, the Wired Magazine and the Wall Street Journal all tell us about it, oh now they
[1:37:29.920 --> 1:37:34.400]  tell us our smart phones don't just track or remove, they're monitoring our psychology
[1:37:34.400 --> 1:37:38.400]  and sending it back to a corporate database globally.
[1:37:38.400 --> 1:37:44.120]  You see, the bear trap closed on our leg now and the vampire walked out of the bushes
[1:37:44.120 --> 1:37:48.880]  and is explaining to us how we're slowly going to bleed us and destroy us.
[1:37:48.880 --> 1:37:54.800]  The bad news is western governments have totally let multinational big tech bring in communist
[1:37:54.800 --> 1:37:59.200]  Chinese style total net surveillance censorship with AI.
[1:37:59.200 --> 1:38:04.680]  The good news is they had to do that to carry out this world government COVID takeover,
[1:38:04.680 --> 1:38:10.480]  this planetary corporate reset that COVID covers for because the truth is powerful and
[1:38:10.480 --> 1:38:17.240]  will defeat them and will smash them and the good news is there's still sites like band.video,
[1:38:17.240 --> 1:38:23.320]  news wars.com, info wars.com, Paul Watson sites summit.news and a lot of other great
[1:38:23.320 --> 1:38:29.560]  sites that are getting massive traffic thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king,
[1:38:29.560 --> 1:38:34.680]  that is queen, that is the master of our own destinies.
[1:38:34.680 --> 1:38:39.400]  Ladies and gentlemen there is a war on reality, a war on civilization, a war on our health,
[1:38:39.400 --> 1:38:41.520]  a war on our economy.
[1:38:41.520 --> 1:38:46.000]  But being aware of it and standing up to it and speaking out against it will defeat it.
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:50.240]  So take action or be slaves.
[1:38:50.240 --> 1:38:54.360]  Storeable food is again available for shipping within three to four weeks.
[1:38:54.360 --> 1:38:58.560]  We have it, it's high quality but it's got to be packaged and shipped out to you.
[1:38:58.560 --> 1:39:01.000]  Some items are shipping in a week, some in four weeks.
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:04.560]  So they're saying three to four weeks, it's my patriot, we have their full catalog, they're

[1:39:16.840 --> 1:39:19.560]  ahead whether Trump wins or loses.
[1:39:19.560 --> 1:39:23.920]  The globalists have already created a world by depression, lockdowns on a planetary scale
[1:39:23.920 --> 1:39:25.520]  and it's only intensifying.
[1:39:25.520 --> 1:39:29.360]  This is one of the big boxes, you've got to get checked off, it's high quality storeable
[1:39:29.360 --> 1:39:30.360]  food.

[1:39:49.840 --> 1:39:54.760]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[1:39:54.760 --> 1:39:59.200]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all

[1:41:07.480 --> 1:41:08.480]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[1:41:08.480 --> 1:41:12.440]  I'm your host Alex Jones, Roger Stodden, Exclusive Worldwide Interviews with us five
[1:41:12.440 --> 1:41:13.440]  minutes to the next hour.
[1:41:13.440 --> 1:41:17.080]  Your brother, mainstream media, government coverup.
[1:41:17.080 --> 1:41:18.080]  You want answers?
[1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:19.080]  You want to stop tyranny?
[1:41:19.080 --> 1:41:20.080]  Well so do we.
[1:41:20.080 --> 1:41:26.520]  So do we, live from the infowar.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:41:26.520 --> 1:41:29.360]  Here's all the listeners supporting Roger Stone because believe me, we're all sitting
[1:41:29.360 --> 1:41:32.600]  in the same tree together.
[1:41:32.600 --> 1:41:36.800]  And the attempt to brand the election is a Russian, the populist movement is un-American
[1:41:36.800 --> 1:41:40.160]  when the globalists are in bed with the chai comms and don't want the country to exist.
[1:41:40.160 --> 1:41:42.600]  It's really ridiculous they're trying to do this.
[1:41:42.600 --> 1:41:44.000]  They're at war with logic.
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:46.880]  They're traitors, proud over the country.
[1:41:46.880 --> 1:41:50.840]  And so they've got to say the loyal patriots are the bad guys but the truth is we're not
[1:41:50.840 --> 1:41:52.120]  and we need to get that word out.
[1:41:52.120 --> 1:41:57.120]  So Roger's victory is all of our victories and I want to ask him about all the wild calls,
[1:41:57.120 --> 1:42:01.240]  what the president said to him, he hasn't really elaborated on that yet, what all the
[1:42:01.240 --> 1:42:05.680]  other big guys in D.C. he knows, what the inside baseball is about what's coming next.
[1:42:05.680 --> 1:42:10.000]  So much with Roger Stone but Roger, finish up with the day after you accept that Jesus
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:15.120]  is your lord and savior, you're already a Christian but not, you know, backslidden obviously
[1:42:15.120 --> 1:42:18.600]  and then really tried and really gave your heart to Christ again, recommitted.
[1:42:18.600 --> 1:42:19.600]  What happened?
[1:42:19.600 --> 1:42:27.800]  Well, this was on a Saturday that I was reborn and that very Monday morning, a day later,
[1:42:27.800 --> 1:42:32.360]  all the stories about the corrupt jury hit the fan, none of which I knew.
[1:42:32.360 --> 1:42:34.160]  We had none of that information.
[1:42:34.160 --> 1:42:39.800]  Frankly, Mike Cernovich, a crusading independent journalist, a solid conservative, broke that
[1:42:39.800 --> 1:42:42.280]  story and it was everywhere.
[1:42:42.280 --> 1:42:48.680]  And from that moment on, I was highly confident that everything was going to be fine, that
[1:42:48.680 --> 1:42:53.600]  God was now going to take his hand and he would provide, that he would, he would in
[1:42:53.600 --> 1:42:56.880]  the end protect me from those who would persecute me.
[1:42:56.880 --> 1:43:02.440]  So I escaped the snare and the fowler as they say in Psalm 91.
[1:43:02.440 --> 1:43:07.560]  And now the hardest part about being a Christian, of course, is the old Roger Stone, you know,
[1:43:07.560 --> 1:43:10.280]  would want, would want revenge.
[1:43:10.280 --> 1:43:12.240]  I'm Sicilian, I would want revenge.
[1:43:12.240 --> 1:43:17.800]  But I realize now that that's not my place, that vengeance belongs to God, that he will
[1:43:17.800 --> 1:43:25.680]  judge and that he will subject those who deserve it to the vengeance that they deserve.
[1:43:25.680 --> 1:43:27.160]  Therefore it's preserved for him.
[1:43:27.160 --> 1:43:31.160]  And the good thing about that is, I know that those who are evil, that those who tried to
[1:43:31.160 --> 1:43:35.640]  destroy me and are trying to destroy you right now, try to destroy General Mike Flynn, a
[1:43:35.640 --> 1:43:41.000]  great patriot, try to take down our great president, they will get their just desserts,
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:45.200]  but they will get it from God, a wrathful God in this case.
[1:43:45.200 --> 1:43:50.600]  And it is a terrible thing to be subjected to the vengeance of the living God, as Hebrews
[1:43:50.600 --> 1:43:54.000]  tell, 3031 tells us.
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:44:01.280]  So Alex, I really do, as I now realize, I have a hard break at two o'clock my time.
[1:44:01.280 --> 1:44:04.360]  So I really do need to talk about my phone call with the president.
[1:44:04.360 --> 1:44:05.920]  Let's do that, let's do it now.
[1:44:05.920 --> 1:44:07.680]  I always came about.
[1:44:07.680 --> 1:44:14.160]  So last Friday, around five o'clock, many media outlets, ABC was among the first, then
[1:44:14.160 --> 1:44:20.000]  Fox News and then everybody, was saying that the president would commute my sentence.
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:24.480]  Prior to that, there was a lot of speculation, it could be a commutation, it could be a pardon,
[1:44:24.480 --> 1:44:26.040]  it could be nothing.
[1:44:26.040 --> 1:44:30.840]  These same reports had popped up the previous Sunday and nothing came of them.
[1:44:30.840 --> 1:44:35.840]  And so it became pretty clear that something was going to happen.
[1:44:35.840 --> 1:44:37.400]  People started just arriving at my home.
[1:44:37.400 --> 1:44:44.280]  I hadn't invited anybody but patriots, folks from the Trump Club, young Republicans, local
[1:44:44.280 --> 1:44:49.680]  conservatives, friends from the Republican Party, a lot of info warriors, people just
[1:44:49.680 --> 1:44:51.680]  started arriving.
[1:44:51.680 --> 1:44:58.040]  And then because I was under house arrest at that time, I could not leave the actual house.
[1:44:58.040 --> 1:45:02.800]  We sorted people out between those who were wearing masks, they were allowed to come in.
[1:45:02.800 --> 1:45:08.440]  Those who didn't have a mask, they could mask in the front yard inside a gate.
[1:45:08.440 --> 1:45:11.760]  Somebody sent out for beer and we had a pop-up party.
[1:45:11.760 --> 1:45:15.360]  And then at around seven o'clock, my cell phone rang.
[1:45:15.360 --> 1:45:20.960]  And it was the White House switchboard operator saying, this is the White House switchboard.
[1:45:20.960 --> 1:45:25.920]  I have a call from the president of the United States, we'd like to speak to Roger Stone.
[1:45:25.920 --> 1:45:28.560]  And I said, this is Roger Stone.
[1:45:28.560 --> 1:45:32.400]  And he said, are you available for a call from the president?
[1:45:32.400 --> 1:45:34.160]  Whoever says no, by the way.
[1:45:34.160 --> 1:45:35.600]  I said, yes, I am.
[1:45:35.600 --> 1:45:36.920]  And he said, one minute, please.
[1:45:36.920 --> 1:45:41.840]  A few minutes later, the president came on and said, Rog, I said, yes, Mr. President.
[1:45:41.840 --> 1:45:46.960]  He said, I want to let you know that right now I have just signed an act of clemency
[1:45:46.960 --> 1:45:53.400]  in which I have commuted your sentence because I believe you did not get a fair trial.
[1:45:53.400 --> 1:45:56.800]  And I think that this was an incredible injustice.
[1:45:56.800 --> 1:46:01.200]  I think the investigation into you was fraudulent.
[1:46:01.200 --> 1:46:06.520]  And I also understand that your life is in danger if you go to a COVID-infested prison.
[1:46:06.520 --> 1:46:09.960]  I actually think he said, coronavirus, invested prison.
[1:46:09.960 --> 1:46:11.760]  And I said, that is correct, Mr. President.
[1:46:11.760 --> 1:46:12.760]  I thank you very much.
[1:46:12.760 --> 1:46:14.880]  I think you've saved my life.
[1:46:14.880 --> 1:46:17.760]  And he said, well, I want you to fight to exonerate your name.
[1:46:17.760 --> 1:46:23.760]  I think you've got a good chance to get this overturned and get exonerated.
[1:46:23.760 --> 1:46:24.760]  And I said, yes, sir.
[1:46:24.760 --> 1:46:27.640]  And he said, that's the difference between a pardon and a commutation.
[1:46:27.640 --> 1:46:29.640]  A pardon is final.
[1:46:29.640 --> 1:46:34.760]  But in this case, you're entitled to go pursue your appeal, which is why I'm still raising
[1:46:34.760 --> 1:46:37.680]  money at StoneDefenseFund.com.
[1:46:37.680 --> 1:46:41.320]  An appeal could cost a million dollars, could take a year.
[1:46:41.320 --> 1:46:42.320]  And I said, yes, sir.
[1:46:42.320 --> 1:46:43.320]  I understand.
[1:46:43.320 --> 1:46:44.320]  And he said, how's your wife?
[1:46:44.320 --> 1:46:45.800]  He said, actually, how's your beautiful wife?
[1:46:45.800 --> 1:46:47.160]  I said, she's great.
[1:46:47.160 --> 1:46:48.480]  I said, how's the first lady?
[1:46:48.480 --> 1:46:51.080]  He says, she fully supports what I have done.
[1:46:51.080 --> 1:46:52.080]  She's one of your fans.
[1:46:52.080 --> 1:46:54.040]  And I said, thank you very much, Mr. President.
[1:46:54.040 --> 1:46:56.240]  And he said, God bless you.
[1:46:56.240 --> 1:46:57.440]  And now you're a free man.
[1:46:57.440 --> 1:46:58.920]  I said, thank you much.
[1:46:58.920 --> 1:47:00.080]  Thank you very much, Mr. President.
[1:47:00.080 --> 1:47:01.080]  I hung up.
[1:47:01.080 --> 1:47:03.520]  It was an amazing moment.
[1:47:03.520 --> 1:47:06.720]  It was like having a weight off of your shoulders.
[1:47:06.720 --> 1:47:11.480]  And this would never have been possible without the help of so many people.
[1:47:11.480 --> 1:47:15.840]  Let's start with Alex Jones, who had never abandoned me, stuck with me through the whole
[1:47:15.840 --> 1:47:16.840]  thing.
[1:47:16.840 --> 1:47:19.120]  I was skeptical in the first that they would really come after me.
[1:47:19.120 --> 1:47:21.480]  But once they did, Alex, you were there.
[1:47:21.480 --> 1:47:23.680]  Their Tucker Carlson is the standout.
[1:47:23.680 --> 1:47:27.240]  Tucker Carlson was incensed by what they did with me.
[1:47:27.240 --> 1:47:29.520]  He has a deep sense of justice.
[1:47:29.520 --> 1:47:30.760]  And he was outraged.
[1:47:30.760 --> 1:47:31.760]  He was so angry.
[1:47:31.760 --> 1:47:33.640]  Isn't he just an amazingly classy guy?
[1:47:33.640 --> 1:47:34.640]  In fact, I appreciate it.
[1:47:34.640 --> 1:47:35.640]  I mean, I already knew him.
[1:47:35.640 --> 1:47:36.640]  He'd been in the office before we'd been to dinner.
[1:47:36.640 --> 1:47:39.320]  But I got to know him and have dinner with him a few times with you.
[1:47:39.320 --> 1:47:41.640]  He is just super classy.
[1:47:41.640 --> 1:47:42.640]  He's a patriot.
[1:47:42.640 --> 1:47:44.080]  And look, I don't know this for certain.
[1:47:44.080 --> 1:47:48.520]  But my guess is he got pressure from the Fox corporate to stop talking about Roger Stone
[1:47:48.520 --> 1:47:49.640]  in this case.
[1:47:49.640 --> 1:47:51.040]  But he would never stop.
[1:47:51.040 --> 1:47:53.520]  He pounded it at every turn of the case.
[1:47:53.520 --> 1:47:56.200]  He took this judge on when she acted improperly.
[1:47:56.200 --> 1:47:59.640]  I mean, I don't you could not have a better friend.
[1:47:59.640 --> 1:48:03.360]  You could not have a more loyal friend than Tucker Carlson.
[1:48:03.360 --> 1:48:05.480]  Sean Hannity, Sean and I were not close.
[1:48:05.480 --> 1:48:07.160]  Now we are good friends.
[1:48:07.160 --> 1:48:10.680]  He stepped right up to the plate and he covered my case.
[1:48:10.680 --> 1:48:13.320]  And I believe he spoke to people in touch with the president.
[1:48:13.320 --> 1:48:17.200]  He may have even spoke to the president, but he was there.
[1:48:17.200 --> 1:48:20.600]  Mark Levin and I have never been friends.
[1:48:20.600 --> 1:48:22.360]  We had some past scuffles.
[1:48:22.360 --> 1:48:25.520]  By the way, they were probably my fault and I've apologized for them.
[1:48:25.520 --> 1:48:26.840]  But that's not the important thing.
[1:48:26.840 --> 1:48:29.120]  What was important here was the principle.
[1:48:29.120 --> 1:48:35.320]  And he did a great job of deconstructing the arguments against me and the and the misconduct
[1:48:35.320 --> 1:48:36.320]  of my office.
[1:48:36.320 --> 1:48:38.080]  While you're at this with us, we got to hit this again.
[1:48:38.080 --> 1:48:42.680]  They're in the news saying on my show, they listed all over and others that you said, quote,
[1:48:42.680 --> 1:48:45.560]  I had a bunch of dirt, but I won't skill in the president.
[1:48:45.560 --> 1:48:46.800]  You never said that.
[1:48:46.800 --> 1:48:49.560]  You said, I will never roll over and make stuff up.
[1:48:49.560 --> 1:48:51.360]  They want me to because there is no dirt.
[1:48:51.360 --> 1:48:54.680]  So I just want you to get that on record for the New York Times.
[1:48:54.680 --> 1:48:55.960]  That is absolutely true.
[1:48:55.960 --> 1:49:00.760]  There was no misconduct by the president or any other illegal activity that I was aware
[1:49:00.760 --> 1:49:01.760]  of.
[1:49:01.760 --> 1:49:04.240]  What I said was I would not lie about the president.
[1:49:04.240 --> 1:49:06.560]  I got to finish my list because it's important.
[1:49:06.560 --> 1:49:07.560]  Keep going.
[1:49:07.560 --> 1:49:10.920]  I got I've got to thank Kristen Davis, who had the guts, my friend who had the guts
[1:49:10.920 --> 1:49:16.960]  to go on CNN and MSNBC and defend me throughout this whole thing, did an amazing job, went
[1:49:16.960 --> 1:49:19.520]  right into the lion's den, beat them back.
[1:49:19.520 --> 1:49:25.040]  I've got to thank Congressman Matt Gates, who was a great supporter, who never let up
[1:49:25.040 --> 1:49:27.720]  in his advocacy on my behalf.
[1:49:27.720 --> 1:49:32.920]  I've got to thank Larry Kudlow, a man who worked closely with the president on the modern
[1:49:32.920 --> 1:49:36.120]  economic miracle, which is the Trump comeback.
[1:49:36.120 --> 1:49:40.440]  I've got to thank my friend, Michael Caputa, who I've been prohibited from speaking to
[1:49:40.440 --> 1:49:42.960]  for almost two years.
[1:49:42.960 --> 1:49:46.360]  But I know he was in my corner.
[1:49:46.360 --> 1:49:47.360]  You never know where to stop.
[1:49:47.360 --> 1:49:54.000]  Reverend Daryl Scott, Pastor Mark Burns, Reverend Randy Coggins, so many Christians, Franklin
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:58.760]  Graham, all of these people, General Mike Flynn in my corner.
[1:49:58.760 --> 1:50:03.120]  God bless every one of you because every one of you contributed to make this happen.
[1:50:03.120 --> 1:50:05.520]  It's impossible to name everybody.
[1:50:05.520 --> 1:50:06.520]  It really is.
[1:50:06.520 --> 1:50:07.520]  I'd like to.
[1:50:07.520 --> 1:50:09.920]  So many great Americans in my corner.
[1:50:09.920 --> 1:50:14.000]  So Alex, by the way, if we let them get you, they're going to get everybody that they said
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:18.600]  the blueprint is to get all Trump supporters to quote, wipe us out.
[1:50:18.600 --> 1:50:22.680]  Look, we're up for the fight of our life.
[1:50:22.680 --> 1:50:27.000]  And this is an important outpost of the truth.
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  Info wars is really still what it always was a leader, and we won't be censored.
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:34.320]  We won't be silenced.
[1:50:34.320 --> 1:50:38.080]  We will never stop fighting for freedom and for liberty.
[1:50:38.080 --> 1:50:40.120]  So I am honored to be back with you.
[1:50:40.120 --> 1:50:41.960]  It's like being back home again.
[1:50:41.960 --> 1:50:46.920]  You can bet that I'll be back again because, you know, I understand they're trying to to
[1:50:46.920 --> 1:50:47.920]  silence us.
[1:50:47.920 --> 1:50:51.680]  They're trying to kill our audience in terms of our reach.
[1:50:51.680 --> 1:50:57.160]  But I feel right at home here and it's just good to be back and be able to tell the truth
[1:50:57.160 --> 1:50:58.160]  to the American people.
[1:50:58.160 --> 1:51:01.560]  And don't forget you already think you're but your wife got 30 seconds.
[1:51:01.560 --> 1:51:03.560]  Your wife gets the most things.
[1:51:03.560 --> 1:51:08.520]  My great wife and my daughter, my wife, media, my daughter, Audrey, my son, Scott, they stuck
[1:51:08.520 --> 1:51:12.440]  with me through thick and thin, particularly when I was having temper tantrums.
[1:51:12.440 --> 1:51:13.440]  They are the best.
[1:51:13.440 --> 1:51:14.880]  Alex, God bless you.
[1:51:14.880 --> 1:51:16.600]  God bless the info wars audience.
[1:51:16.600 --> 1:51:18.040]  God bless everyone.
[1:51:18.040 --> 1:51:20.000]  The Lord has saved my life.
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:22.040]  This is indeed a glorious day.
[1:51:22.040 --> 1:51:23.040]  All right.
[1:51:23.040 --> 1:51:25.240]  Now you're back in the game to get Trump reelected with 111 days.
[1:51:25.240 --> 1:51:26.240]  God bless you, Roger.
[1:51:26.240 --> 1:51:27.240]  Thank you so much.
[1:51:27.240 --> 1:51:31.520]  We're going to destroy what's happening with the whole COVID takeover and so much more
[1:51:31.520 --> 1:51:32.520]  of the special guest.
[1:51:32.520 --> 1:51:36.680]  We're number three, only two minutes away.
[1:51:36.680 --> 1:51:43.160]  So I was taking care of an errand this morning and I wasn't even close to downtown, but I
[1:51:43.160 --> 1:51:45.760]  was parked on a little side street going to this business.
[1:51:45.760 --> 1:51:52.320]  When I came back out, I saw what looked like two Asian folks, probably Chinese, walking
[1:51:52.320 --> 1:51:56.760]  down the sidewalk about 50 yards up ahead of me and here I am parked a truck with the
[1:51:56.760 --> 1:52:02.240]  windows up and the woman stops and points at me so they stop and they wait while I'm
[1:52:02.240 --> 1:52:03.440]  inside my truck.
[1:52:03.440 --> 1:52:08.000]  Truck started and they sit there and stretch keeps pointing and they put their hands out
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:14.840]  like they're waiting for me to go because I'm not wearing a mask inside my car.
[1:52:14.840 --> 1:52:18.680]  And so then I just sat there so they acted angry and walked past me.
[1:52:18.680 --> 1:52:24.240]  I almost shot a video of it on my phone, but everybody sees this stuff happening everywhere.
[1:52:24.240 --> 1:52:25.240]  This has been a long list.
[1:52:25.240 --> 1:52:28.760]  People are pulling guns on folks that aren't wearing masks.
[1:52:28.760 --> 1:52:29.760]  This is all cold programming.
[1:52:29.760 --> 1:52:31.640]  This is all about submitting.
[1:52:31.640 --> 1:52:34.520]  We cannot submit to this UN brainwashing.
[1:52:34.520 --> 1:52:35.880]  It's all a giant fraud.
[1:52:35.880 --> 1:52:40.560]  We must expose the fraud or become slaves to it.
[1:52:40.560 --> 1:52:46.240]  Americans have had freedom for so long and most Americans were born into such docile
[1:52:46.240 --> 1:52:50.960]  times compared to the rest of history that we really have a blind spot for tyranny.
[1:52:50.960 --> 1:52:56.240]  We don't appreciate the American way, truth, justice, due process, the right to self-defense,
[1:52:56.240 --> 1:52:59.480]  private property because we've had it so long and we just think that's how the rest
[1:52:59.480 --> 1:53:00.480]  of the world is.
[1:53:00.480 --> 1:53:05.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, the renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try
[1:53:05.280 --> 1:53:09.600]  to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak as
[1:53:09.600 --> 1:53:13.040]  well as the strong is something the West invented.
[1:53:13.040 --> 1:53:14.760]  And that's what made our modern world.
[1:53:14.760 --> 1:53:19.000]  That's now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists who say humans are ugly
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:24.440]  and bad for the earth and we need to be cold and dumbed down and put into subgroups that
[1:53:24.440 --> 1:53:29.360]  the elites dominate, manipulate, and command if we're even lucky enough to stay alive.
[1:53:29.360 --> 1:53:30.880]  And that's what COVID-19 is.
[1:53:30.880 --> 1:53:36.920]  A global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family, against prosperity and
[1:53:36.920 --> 1:53:37.920]  against your future.
[1:53:37.920 --> 1:53:43.480]  If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[1:53:43.480 --> 1:54:03.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:54:03.040 --> 1:54:05.920]  I have to ask you about Roger Stone.
[1:54:05.920 --> 1:54:12.280]  Help me understand, A, why do presidents or should presidents have the power to pardon
[1:54:12.280 --> 1:54:15.880]  anybody, especially someone who's related to them in a case?
[1:54:15.880 --> 1:54:21.480]  And secondly, what precedents could Trump be setting for America slash, do you think
[1:54:21.480 --> 1:54:26.920]  it's going to be a precedent where a president says, I will pardon anybody who protects me
[1:54:26.920 --> 1:54:28.400]  by not snitching?
[1:54:28.400 --> 1:54:32.720]  Well, I think you just summed up why Roger Stone was pardoned.
[1:54:32.720 --> 1:54:38.320]  I mean, he basically threatened Trump, you know, he basically said, I sure don't want
[1:54:38.320 --> 1:54:41.080]  to go to jail and I sure have a lot more to say.
[1:54:41.080 --> 1:54:44.840]  And boy, I just wish there'd be somebody who could stop me from having to go to jail
[1:54:44.840 --> 1:54:48.320]  and guess what, you know, Trump intervened.
[1:54:48.320 --> 1:54:53.080]  This is an extension of the total disregard for the rule of law.
[1:54:53.080 --> 1:55:01.480]  The pardon power is supposed to be used for compassionate purposes to try to right wrongs,
[1:55:01.480 --> 1:55:09.600]  to try to make sure that people are not being punished unfairly or have been punished enough.
[1:55:09.600 --> 1:55:16.960]  But in this case, it's a continuation of the cover-up because of one thing that's wrong.
[1:55:16.960 --> 1:55:21.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, Roger Stone was on my show almost every day and co-hosting the war
[1:55:21.120 --> 1:55:22.440]  room during that entire time.
[1:55:22.440 --> 1:55:28.440]  He was here for a good year and a half before the election.
[1:55:28.440 --> 1:55:32.480]  I knew every major move Roger was making.
[1:55:32.480 --> 1:55:36.160]  And it was just good old fashioned campaigning, exposing the Clinton's war on women, exposing
[1:55:36.160 --> 1:55:40.560]  their war on black people, pushing Trump to do the whole decriminalization, let blacks
[1:55:40.560 --> 1:55:43.360]  out of jail move.
[1:55:43.360 --> 1:55:44.640]  I mean, that's Roger Stone.
[1:55:44.640 --> 1:55:45.640]  That's not Jared Kushner.
[1:55:45.640 --> 1:55:49.960]  You can disagree with part of those policies or not, marijuana legalization, all that.
[1:55:49.960 --> 1:55:50.960]  That's Roger.
[1:55:50.960 --> 1:55:54.040]  He's really a liberal, a nationalist and a conservative.
[1:55:54.040 --> 1:55:59.120]  But we were there mad at Julian Assange when he was doing New York Times, Washington Post
[1:55:59.120 --> 1:56:02.240]  interviews every week, not giving us an interview.
[1:56:02.240 --> 1:56:06.480]  I told Roger, I said, I'll hire you if you can get Julian Assange on.
[1:56:06.480 --> 1:56:07.480]  He was trying.
[1:56:07.480 --> 1:56:10.400]  He was getting talked to the hand.
[1:56:10.400 --> 1:56:14.480]  It's cool to be the underdog info wars, but I mean, you know, we get treated like crap
[1:56:14.480 --> 1:56:16.560]  by a lot of people that don't get it.
[1:56:16.560 --> 1:56:21.320]  So the idea that he was a Russian spy, I was just telling Roger, we're talking about it.
[1:56:21.320 --> 1:56:22.320]  It's stupid.
[1:56:22.320 --> 1:56:23.320]  That's ridiculous.
[1:56:23.320 --> 1:56:27.600]  Then they started saying it about me and Congress, like, oh, he's a Russian agent in arm services
[1:56:27.600 --> 1:56:32.560]  committee meetings and just the most crazy stuff and then things I can't get into at
[1:56:32.560 --> 1:56:36.000]  this point because there's, uh, you know, investigations and the people that did it
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:39.160]  and the rest of it, but, uh, it's been wild folks.
[1:56:39.160 --> 1:56:45.240]  When you've done nothing, they're accusing you of none of it, not 1% is true.
[1:56:45.240 --> 1:56:47.480]  They're still coming after you folks.
[1:56:47.480 --> 1:56:51.440]  I was going to launch a whole string of new items.
[1:56:51.440 --> 1:56:57.960]  I guess it's eight items total mouthwash and, uh, also a activated charcoal toothpaste
[1:56:57.960 --> 1:57:00.920]  that my dad has retired dentist developed that has no fillers.
[1:57:00.920 --> 1:57:02.440]  It's super high end.
[1:57:02.440 --> 1:57:07.280]  It's incredible toothpaste and it's not to compete with our tooth whitening toothpaste
[1:57:07.280 --> 1:57:12.600]  and our colloidal silver toothpaste, uh, that we've discontinued until, uh, Leticia James
[1:57:12.600 --> 1:57:18.040]  stops lying and saying, uh, that we have some type of cure, uh, for something.
[1:57:18.040 --> 1:57:20.280]  It's absolutely asinine.
[1:57:20.280 --> 1:57:21.920]  It's not true at all.
[1:57:21.920 --> 1:57:22.920]  It's just ridiculous.
[1:57:22.920 --> 1:57:29.120]  Now we've got the new toothpaste in for a few weeks, but I've got one more big test
[1:57:29.120 --> 1:57:33.280]  that, uh, we are supposed to do on it until we're able to sell it.
[1:57:33.280 --> 1:57:38.600]  So I thought that this week, uh, would be the week that we would be able, uh, to sell
[1:57:38.600 --> 1:57:41.880]  all of this and do all of this, but we're not able.
[1:57:41.880 --> 1:57:47.040]  So the original sale that I had running is just going to keep running until next week
[1:57:47.040 --> 1:57:50.400]  store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points, but it's even bigger.
[1:57:50.400 --> 1:57:51.400]  We had to sell last year.
[1:57:51.400 --> 1:57:52.400]  I wasn't going to do it at this time.
[1:57:52.400 --> 1:57:56.120]  We're about to sell a lot of things, but we're launching it right now.
[1:57:56.120 --> 1:58:04.040]  Christmas in July sale, free shipping and double Patriot points, 50 to 60% off.
[1:58:04.040 --> 1:58:06.760]  And we've got brain force plus 50% off.
[1:58:06.760 --> 1:58:07.760]  These are things we're adding.

[1:58:41.280 --> 1:58:48.040]  and Patriot points, our special guest joins us when we come right back on the other side.
[1:58:48.040 --> 1:58:53.120]  Whether you believe in evolution in the modern theory or not, the globalist controllers
[1:58:53.120 --> 1:58:58.800]  do, and they constantly write about and talk about how they want to create a global crisis
[1:58:58.800 --> 1:59:04.560]  or a group of crises that force humans to, quote, evolve in a new, better way.
[1:59:04.560 --> 1:59:08.400]  Now, when you study how they actually want you to evolve, you believe in that, it is
[1:59:08.400 --> 1:59:12.480]  to stop having children emerge with silicon bodies and a post-human future.
[1:59:12.480 --> 1:59:19.200]  Talk about psychotic, talk about creepy, talk about crazy, but they need an event like COVID-19
[1:59:19.200 --> 1:59:24.520]  to teach a mammal to wear some covering over its nose, over its breathing tubes to set
[1:59:24.520 --> 1:59:30.200]  the precedent for the forced inoculations, for the GMO, for the 5G, and for all the things
[1:59:30.200 --> 1:59:33.600]  that they admit will end our humanity as we know it.
[1:59:33.600 --> 1:59:34.920]  That's why this is so evil.
[1:59:34.920 --> 1:59:41.400]  Our whole agenda for cashless society, global government, UN control, getting us all into
[1:59:41.400 --> 1:59:46.360]  debt, getting rid of local government, think about all the facets of the censorship, the
[1:59:46.360 --> 2:00:13.920]  mass-surveillance.
[2:00:13.920 --> 2:00:33.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are Backline broadcasting worldwide on this Tuesday edition.
[2:00:33.200 --> 2:00:38.400]  And everybody knows Jim Hoft of Gateway Pundit, and the great job he does.
[2:00:38.400 --> 2:00:40.680]  But his brother is an executive.
[2:00:40.680 --> 2:00:41.800]  He's lived in Asia.
[2:00:41.800 --> 2:00:43.320]  He was recently living in Hong Kong.
[2:00:43.320 --> 2:00:46.520]  He's moved back to the United States with his family, Joe Hoft, and he's done a great
[2:00:46.520 --> 2:00:52.800]  job writing articles at the Gateway Pundit laying out, really, the fraud that is COVID,
[2:00:52.800 --> 2:00:56.960]  the overblown hoax, all the different facets of them, counting other people that died of
[2:00:56.960 --> 2:01:00.720]  gunshot wounds and car wrecks in the COVID column and the false positive test.
[2:01:00.720 --> 2:01:10.480]  But the big smoking gun for me is on Infowars.com, COVID testing scandal, numerous labs, 333.
[2:01:10.480 --> 2:01:15.640]  100% of people testing positive for coronavirus in Florida.
[2:01:15.640 --> 2:01:16.640]  That is impossible.
[2:01:16.640 --> 2:01:21.080]  And again, I told the story of my wife's personal trainer, she's a friend of mine.
[2:01:21.080 --> 2:01:23.320]  She goes on the boat with us and goes hiking with us.
[2:01:23.320 --> 2:01:27.000]  She has two older ladies, she's a trainer for.
[2:01:27.000 --> 2:01:32.200]  And they went in a few weeks ago to get tested because they had a sore throat and sniffles.
[2:01:32.200 --> 2:01:34.480]  Didn't have a fever, but they stood in line.
[2:01:34.480 --> 2:01:35.480]  They said, just fill out these forms.
[2:01:35.480 --> 2:01:38.560]  They said, you don't need to go do the test now.
[2:01:38.560 --> 2:01:39.560]  You can go.
[2:01:39.560 --> 2:01:44.440]  And I got on the phone and got the lady's number and called and wanted, she's scared
[2:01:44.440 --> 2:01:45.440]  to come on.
[2:01:45.440 --> 2:01:49.040]  But she said, yeah, no, we got told we both had COVID-19, but no treatment needed.
[2:01:49.040 --> 2:01:50.720]  This is premeditated fraud.
[2:01:50.720 --> 2:01:54.320]  It's being directed by the NIH from the UN.
[2:01:54.320 --> 2:01:55.440]  And it's just unbelievable.
[2:01:55.440 --> 2:01:59.440]  And then you add California locking down again, Texas getting ready to, I'm told Austin
[2:01:59.440 --> 2:02:01.320]  today or tomorrow is about to do it.
[2:02:01.320 --> 2:02:03.000]  They admit they want to create a depression.
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:04.560]  It's just insane.
[2:02:04.560 --> 2:02:07.440]  So joining us is Joe Hoft of theGatewayPundit.com.
[2:02:07.440 --> 2:02:11.560]  Joe, thanks for joining us, you're an expert on this, living in it, seeing it, writing
[2:02:11.560 --> 2:02:12.560]  about it.
[2:02:12.560 --> 2:02:15.760]  What would you describe the root of this is and who's directing it?
[2:02:15.760 --> 2:02:20.520]  Because it is a directed fraud and they're trying to get a national emergency declared
[2:02:20.520 --> 2:02:24.640]  so that the central government can direct the fraud to the other 30-something states
[2:02:24.640 --> 2:02:25.800]  that aren't going along with it.
[2:02:25.800 --> 2:02:30.360]  I mean, this is the biggest institutional organized fraud I've ever even imagined.
[2:02:30.360 --> 2:02:33.600]  What would you call this?
[2:02:33.600 --> 2:02:40.000]  I guess another part of the rolling coup, rolling coup, that's it COVID-19 part of the
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:41.000]  rolling coup.
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:45.480]  Isn't that something I heard somebody else share that recently on another interview.
[2:02:45.480 --> 2:02:50.800]  And I thought that explains best what's going on in this, you know, in these last three
[2:02:50.800 --> 2:02:58.040]  and a half, four years, we've jumped from Mueller to impeachment to COVID and the military's
[2:02:58.040 --> 2:03:04.200]  jumped in now recently opposing Trump and it's just part of a rolling coup d'etat that
[2:03:04.200 --> 2:03:08.840]  they've attempted to remove this president from office.
[2:03:08.840 --> 2:03:13.800]  Now as far as the COVID itself, you know, we've got more and more evidence now that
[2:03:13.800 --> 2:03:20.880]  it's certainly came out of China and it's attached to that lab in Wuhan, the Institute
[2:03:20.880 --> 2:03:21.880]  of Virology.
[2:03:21.880 --> 2:03:24.600]  I've been to Wuhan a number of times.
[2:03:24.600 --> 2:03:30.760]  I know, I know that city, it's a massive city and this lab was just only minutes away
[2:03:30.760 --> 2:03:38.440]  from the market that the Chinese were attempting to tie the virus to.
[2:03:38.440 --> 2:03:41.840]  So yeah, I think there's a number of parties involved, Alex.
[2:03:41.840 --> 2:03:43.200]  I think China's involved.
[2:03:43.200 --> 2:03:53.120]  I think the you, you know, individuals in the US, big pharma is a suggested, you know,
[2:03:53.120 --> 2:03:54.640]  group of companies that are involved.
[2:03:54.640 --> 2:04:00.120]  There's a lot of money involved in this already, you know, billions being either allocated
[2:04:00.120 --> 2:04:01.120]  or spent.
[2:04:01.120 --> 2:04:04.440]  So a lot of players involved for sure.
[2:04:04.440 --> 2:04:10.160]  Well, let's, let's, let's back away from this and look at it because Bill Gates said
[2:04:10.160 --> 2:04:12.600]  five months ago, the lockdown never end.
[2:04:12.600 --> 2:04:13.600]  We're going to keep it in place.
[2:04:13.600 --> 2:04:16.800]  You'll have to have an inoculation before you get it.
[2:04:16.800 --> 2:04:18.840]  And so of course here we are following that script.
[2:04:18.840 --> 2:04:24.360]  Obviously, he set up the John Hopkins event 201, the Rockefellers have the lockstep.
[2:04:24.360 --> 2:04:25.360]  This is all codified.
[2:04:25.360 --> 2:04:26.520]  How do we defeat the fraud?
[2:04:26.520 --> 2:04:31.720]  Don't we show how it's premeditated and how Fauci owns part of the vaccine companies
[2:04:31.720 --> 2:04:34.240]  and how it's insider trading and conflicts of interest?
[2:04:34.240 --> 2:04:38.360]  I mean, I think Trump has set up just showing how Fauci was wrong all these times in sidelining
[2:04:38.360 --> 2:04:39.360]  him.
[2:04:39.360 --> 2:04:41.120]  We have the Washington Post saying Trump's not allowed to fire him.
[2:04:41.120 --> 2:04:42.120]  That's of course, is ridiculous.
[2:04:42.120 --> 2:04:44.600]  He can remove the head of the department if they don't fire him.
[2:04:44.600 --> 2:04:50.520]  I mean, what, how does, how does Trump and how do the American people go on the offense?
[2:04:50.520 --> 2:04:51.520]  That's a good question.
[2:04:51.520 --> 2:04:55.560]  Alex, I guess we need to continue to do what we're doing here and, and at the Gateway Pond
[2:04:55.560 --> 2:05:00.880]  and that's just continue to share the truth, do all we can to get the word out.
[2:05:00.880 --> 2:05:03.760]  And I think we are being heard.
[2:05:03.760 --> 2:05:07.280]  I think we are being heard and there's a lot of people that are very frustrated about
[2:05:07.280 --> 2:05:11.560]  this situation, not just in the US, but around the world.
[2:05:11.560 --> 2:05:17.760]  And a lot of people have been frightened because, you know, due to this coronavirus as well.
[2:05:17.760 --> 2:05:22.480]  So we've come up with some evidence early on and maybe you recall last time I was on
[2:05:22.480 --> 2:05:27.480]  your show was back in March, it was the, I believe it was March 17th and I, we had just
[2:05:27.480 --> 2:05:36.400]  come out with some analysis that I had done for Jim, where we looked at the WHO, the World
[2:05:36.400 --> 2:05:46.000]  Health Organization and their analysis and prediction for the deaths related to the coronavirus.
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:49.760]  And they scared basically the hell out of everybody because they were saying the flu
[2:05:49.760 --> 2:06:01.400]  has a point, what, 0.06% rate of mortality for of those that are have the have the flu.
[2:06:01.400 --> 2:06:05.560]  Whereas the coronavirus only had or had a 3.4%.
[2:06:05.560 --> 2:06:11.280]  So almost a 50 or so time more than a 50 turns out that is an admitted complete giant fraud
[2:06:11.280 --> 2:06:16.040]  and medical doctors say the numbers are lower than the flu.
[2:06:16.040 --> 2:06:17.200]  Can you speak to that?
[2:06:17.200 --> 2:06:23.440]  Because they said 2.5 million dead, 2.2 million dead in the US 500,000 dead in the UK all massively
[2:06:23.440 --> 2:06:25.920]  exaggerated 20 plus times.
[2:06:25.920 --> 2:06:26.920]  And then that was it.
[2:06:26.920 --> 2:06:31.360]  So that I think was a big part, you know, part of this coup was let's scare everybody
[2:06:31.360 --> 2:06:35.720]  and let's shut down the economy and that was the that's that's certainly what they wanted.
[2:06:35.720 --> 2:06:38.320]  And once they panicked us into submitting boom, the trap is shut.
[2:06:38.320 --> 2:06:40.520]  Now it doesn't matter if it was all fraud, they've got us.
[2:06:40.520 --> 2:06:41.520]  Yeah, that's right.
[2:06:41.520 --> 2:06:43.920]  And now a lot of people don't want to admit that they were wrong.
[2:06:43.920 --> 2:06:49.080]  They don't want to admit their their fools and they go along with this insanity.
[2:06:49.080 --> 2:06:51.480]  And the rest of us sit back and say, this is crazy.
[2:06:51.480 --> 2:06:59.520]  So I we flew back from Hong Kong a few weeks ago back to the States and we were at we arrive
[2:06:59.520 --> 2:07:04.240]  at the airport and they tell us, oh, you can't fly through Japan, their airports shut down
[2:07:04.240 --> 2:07:05.240]  at night.
[2:07:05.240 --> 2:07:09.400]  So so we had to quickly rearrange our flights.
[2:07:09.400 --> 2:07:13.800]  And 12 hours later, we were able to fly through San Francisco, but we saw one of the world's
[2:07:13.800 --> 2:07:20.360]  most efficient and and busy airports in the world, the Hong Kong airport.
[2:07:20.360 --> 2:07:22.160]  We were there was only one lounge open.
[2:07:22.160 --> 2:07:23.160]  We were there.
[2:07:23.160 --> 2:07:28.320]  We were the only three people in that lounge for hours that day on a Sunday afternoon.
[2:07:28.320 --> 2:07:33.840]  So in effect, Hong Kong airport was shut down, Japan's airport shut down.
[2:07:33.840 --> 2:07:39.000]  And then we get to San Francisco and that airport shut down three massive airports that
[2:07:39.000 --> 2:07:40.160]  have been impacted.
[2:07:40.160 --> 2:07:47.560]  And now it just gives you a feel for just the insanity and the and the massive fear that
[2:07:47.560 --> 2:07:54.120]  was that was sold to people around the world and and and everybody bought into it.
[2:07:54.120 --> 2:07:58.240]  And and it was a you guys didn't we didn't let me ask you this.
[2:07:58.240 --> 2:08:02.680]  When somebody's in Stockholm syndrome, serving their abusers like the general public, how
[2:08:02.680 --> 2:08:07.000]  do you get them out once they because yeah, I've had family that's been in you know, cond
[2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:10.680]  and stuff, and they'll get mad at me telling somebody's a con artist.
[2:08:10.680 --> 2:08:15.080]  And even once it comes out that I was right, the family will never talk to you again for
[2:08:15.080 --> 2:08:16.560]  for warning them.
[2:08:16.560 --> 2:08:18.240]  Yeah, you're right, Alex.
[2:08:18.240 --> 2:08:19.240]  It's just it.
[2:08:19.240 --> 2:08:20.960]  Well, it's insanity.
[2:08:20.960 --> 2:08:26.000]  Like you said, group thank and and there is this element of ego that people have that
[2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:29.600]  they don't want to admit that they're wrong and so we were spot on.
[2:08:29.600 --> 2:08:32.600]  We knew that that WHO prediction was way off.
[2:08:32.600 --> 2:08:36.560]  We reported it and actually then the next day we were attacked.
[2:08:36.560 --> 2:08:39.200]  We were attacked by media matters.
[2:08:39.200 --> 2:08:44.880]  They they did a hit piece on us both both on you and in the Gateway Pundit and because
[2:08:44.880 --> 2:08:50.320]  Jim was on that call as well and and myself and they criticized us and called us fake
[2:08:50.320 --> 2:08:51.720]  news, etc.
[2:08:51.720 --> 2:08:53.800]  And we were absolutely correct.
[2:08:53.800 --> 2:08:58.840]  And actually, we're as we start looking at numbers today, even today, I'm getting some
[2:08:58.840 --> 2:08:59.840]  new numbers.
[2:08:59.840 --> 2:09:04.680]  If the one so what are the best measurements I've seen as an individual, a PhD who's sent
[2:09:04.680 --> 2:09:10.040]  us some data and he just sent me some updated data will be putting it up later today that
[2:09:10.040 --> 2:09:17.200]  shows probably the best analysis is not just to look for the number of cases of COVID because
[2:09:17.200 --> 2:09:24.200]  we know that the CDC and other entities are are are are are distorting the data.
[2:09:24.200 --> 2:09:26.040]  It's not it's not accurate.
[2:09:26.040 --> 2:09:28.280]  They claim everything is a COVID death.
[2:09:28.280 --> 2:09:32.280]  Let's walk through that in the articles you've written for Gateway Pundit the detail at all
[2:09:32.280 --> 2:09:35.880]  on the other side because this is so important.
[2:09:35.880 --> 2:09:39.160]  This guy was right about the previous fraud dead on his brother was I mean, even more
[2:09:39.160 --> 2:09:40.160]  dead on than we were.

[2:12:03.360 --> 2:12:17.440]  I had to ask Joe Hoft and I did you don't have to wait until you die to learn the truth
[2:12:17.440 --> 2:12:29.080]  about COVID-19 till the day you die if you're reading the New York Times Washington Post
[2:12:29.080 --> 2:12:38.840]  4 watching CNN I'm Alex Jones your host Joe Hoft is an executive researcher author rights
[2:12:38.840 --> 2:12:44.080]  for Gateway Pundit his twin brother of course runs it the Gateway Pundit.com a lot of inside
[2:12:44.080 --> 2:12:48.200]  baseball but he's been persecuted for his visit here we've got all these other medical
[2:12:48.200 --> 2:12:52.160]  doctors I'll play a clip of one coming up who's in the state Senate of Minnesota same
[2:12:52.160 --> 2:12:56.360]  as his way overblown here's the numbers and they're trying to take his license for saying
[2:12:56.360 --> 2:13:01.200]  two plus two equals four so let's roll through it what has occurred since your last visit
[2:13:01.200 --> 2:13:06.240]  with us the real numbers on COVID-19 what's currently happening and what you expect them
[2:13:06.240 --> 2:13:11.920]  to do next because you hear everywhere the tester everywhere and the numbers are skyrocketing
[2:13:11.920 --> 2:13:15.720]  and then you learn almost all the tests are false and three hundred and thirty three labs
[2:13:15.720 --> 2:13:22.320]  that said earlier in Florida all reported publicly 100% rates some of them testing thousands
[2:13:22.320 --> 2:13:27.880]  the average about 500 so they're testing tens of thousands of people and they're all positive
[2:13:27.880 --> 2:13:34.320]  that is ridiculous what's really going on here well that's a that's a great question
[2:13:34.320 --> 2:13:39.840]  Alex I it's funny over the weekend my daughter was visiting in the older daughter and adult
[2:13:39.840 --> 2:13:44.560]  daughter and she and I and I said to her I don't even know anymore we're being lied
[2:13:44.560 --> 2:13:51.720]  to so much who even knows if these tests even work I mean who really even knows anymore
[2:13:51.720 --> 2:13:57.680]  and so we're not going to have three hundred and thirty three labs all say 100% when they're
[2:13:57.680 --> 2:14:03.320]  testing hundreds and hundreds of people that's right statistically just not possible and
[2:14:03.320 --> 2:14:07.560]  so so we found a number of things over the last few months gosh it's been since March
[2:14:07.560 --> 2:14:13.240]  since we last talked but you know even back then in March we knew the WHO was lying about
[2:14:13.240 --> 2:14:18.800]  the about their prediction there's just it just didn't add up it didn't make sense and
[2:14:18.800 --> 2:14:22.600]  we did a number of posts on that one thing that we did find though about the WHO that's
[2:14:22.600 --> 2:14:28.720]  not commonly known is that Todd dross that individual who runs the WHO is a member of
[2:14:28.720 --> 2:14:35.440]  a terrorist group that runs Ethiopia he's like number four in charge and started a major
[2:14:35.440 --> 2:14:41.480]  call out breaks as he's written there you go and he's also was involved in some some
[2:14:41.480 --> 2:14:45.920]  terrorist actions there in that country as well so this is the guy that's running the
[2:14:45.920 --> 2:14:50.840]  WHO and that's factual you can we you know we were able to put that together we had support
[2:14:50.840 --> 2:14:56.760]  for the entire piece and then and we then with the ties to China is because Ethiopia
[2:14:56.760 --> 2:15:02.640]  is just now a puppet of China so even when during the covid crisis they kept the airports
[2:15:02.640 --> 2:15:08.840]  open between these two entities so they're the two countries so that's why Ted Ross
[2:15:08.840 --> 2:15:14.320]  would do everything China said is because China's been backing his regime in absolutely
[2:15:14.320 --> 2:15:18.640]  so Trump is the right thing pulling out of the WHO absolutely absolutely so that was
[2:15:18.640 --> 2:15:24.800]  great along with that then we we you know we've learned a lot too as well about Dr.
[2:15:24.800 --> 2:15:31.000]  Fauci Dr. Berks Fauci has a long record that guy sounds very very corrupt when you look
[2:15:31.000 --> 2:15:38.160]  into it I think one of the best individuals to discuss Fauci and and just the vaccines
[2:15:38.160 --> 2:15:45.840]  in general if not you Alex is the Bobby Kennedy jr. I heard a video well he exposes fraud
[2:15:45.840 --> 2:15:49.280]  Steve with the gates people that they've had in the test three with spokespersons are
[2:15:49.280 --> 2:15:54.240]  getting real sick healthy people are getting real sick in the vaccine trials yeah and and
[2:15:54.240 --> 2:15:59.200]  that blew me away you know when I when I learned that and when I saw his or listened in on
[2:15:59.200 --> 2:16:04.920]  one of his discussions and and you know I grew up maybe like you Alex I grew up thinking
[2:16:04.920 --> 2:16:10.040]  you know the US was this great country and Bobby Kennedy was a hero and and even though
[2:16:10.040 --> 2:16:15.160]  my mom was Republican she liked Bobby Kennedy and when he died there was a sad day for the
[2:16:15.160 --> 2:16:21.560]  entire country when he was assassinated absolutely and but to see his son then stand up and then
[2:16:21.560 --> 2:16:25.840]  the rest of the family criticizes the son for being crazy or whatever and then you listen
[2:16:25.840 --> 2:16:31.240]  to it and you listen to that lady that was targeted by Fauci who had uncovered the information
[2:16:31.240 --> 2:16:36.400]  that these vaccines are dangerous yeah the top he's a top virologist on record exposes
[2:16:36.400 --> 2:16:42.120]  fraud and they had her swatting he has been the kingpin for four years and I he's like
[2:16:42.120 --> 2:16:46.880]  a little he's he's a bureaucratic royalty he's an emperor yeah yeah and he's been with
[2:16:46.880 --> 2:16:51.520]  everybody and he's made a lot of money along the way to no doubt I'd love to see somebody
[2:16:51.520 --> 2:16:56.280]  ask him some questions about what's your annual salary and what's your network he got a hundred
[2:16:56.280 --> 2:17:01.560]  and eleven million dollar grant last year from Bellamona Gates in one year yeah yeah
[2:17:01.560 --> 2:17:05.760]  and that's what also prevents a number of these doctors I think to stand up and say
[2:17:05.760 --> 2:17:10.560]  things is because they're all being paid for by the Gates Foundation and others but yeah
[2:17:10.560 --> 2:17:15.760]  Fauci's just a piece of work he he how many times has he talked about mass we still don't
[2:17:15.760 --> 2:17:20.960]  know what his position is on mass I guess now he's saying it's good to wear mass you know
[2:17:20.960 --> 2:17:26.360]  yeah oh it's crazy don't wear him now everybody's got to wear him it's just crazy so him Dr.
[2:17:26.360 --> 2:17:33.320]  Burks she's has ties her husband worked with the Clinton White House she worked under Obama
[2:17:33.320 --> 2:17:37.960]  she had ties to Fauci as well I mean those two leading this charge and then that it sounds
[2:17:37.960 --> 2:17:43.080]  like they were the two that talked President Trump into shutting down the economy and
[2:17:43.080 --> 2:17:46.920]  very I gotta be honest with you I took the bait thinking if it's really gonna be bad
[2:17:46.920 --> 2:17:50.000]  if he doesn't do something he'll get blamed they were gonna do it regardless and it turned
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:55.840]  out to be basically a total fraud and and so you guys were right I I basically dropped
[2:17:55.840 --> 2:18:00.880]  the ball early on that's what I'm saying is you guys have been dead on well thanks Alex
[2:18:00.880 --> 2:18:05.840]  and and you know but I think but I but you know Trump wasn't it was it was another one
[2:18:05.840 --> 2:18:11.320]  of these no win situations that the a deep states put him in like with the Mueller Mueller
[2:18:11.320 --> 2:18:17.820]  gang where he it was clear of clear criminal act there was no crimes criminal being on
[2:18:17.820 --> 2:18:26.160]  Mueller and Weissman's part no crimes ever committed they didn't even the the entire
[2:18:26.160 --> 2:18:33.000]  Russia gate and and Mueller special counsel wasn't even based on crime it was unconstitutional
[2:18:33.000 --> 2:18:38.760]  and so but Trump never never never bit me allowed this thing to continue so he wouldn't
[2:18:38.760 --> 2:18:44.560]  get charged with obstruction and I I admire his courage and ability to do that because
[2:18:44.560 --> 2:18:48.520]  I don't know if I could I totally agree but now the just department is scared and Berman
[2:18:48.520 --> 2:18:52.160]  isn't gonna do anything to have the election that's only gonna encourage the deep state
[2:18:52.160 --> 2:18:56.320]  like you said they've had the military all come out the top brasses announced Trump and
[2:18:56.320 --> 2:19:00.360]  now the Washington Post last week said it's time for a military coup they don't put stuff
[2:19:00.360 --> 2:19:05.480]  out like that unless they're planning something yeah that's right and it was like Obama coming
[2:19:05.480 --> 2:19:12.040]  out after a general Flynn was after the case if Flynn fell apart and he see encourages people
[2:19:12.040 --> 2:19:16.160]  to stand up and then now we've got this judge Sullivan doing the craziest stuff we've ever
[2:19:16.160 --> 2:19:21.520]  seen our lifetime most unbelievable yeah doesn't I mean I know there's a mixed groups in the
[2:19:21.520 --> 2:19:24.480]  deep state there's the ultra deep state it's really worthy American people in the deep
[2:19:24.480 --> 2:19:30.520]  state but the establishment is crazy if they keep trying to have a war with the people
[2:19:30.520 --> 2:19:35.360]  isn't there a smart establishment that realizes this is dangerous well isn't that isn't that
[2:19:35.360 --> 2:19:39.400]  true I think the people that's the thing thank God for the people not just in the US but
[2:19:39.400 --> 2:19:43.160]  around the world people are waking up to this stuff I think that one of the greatest things
[2:19:43.160 --> 2:19:47.480]  that Trump did other than beating Hillary and being in her head ever since was the force
[2:19:47.480 --> 2:19:52.920]  the deep state out in the oven that's right and to also point out the fact that our media
[2:19:52.920 --> 2:19:59.160]  is corrupt and I love that because more and more people now are aware of that and that
[2:19:59.160 --> 2:20:03.640]  may be maybe his greatest accomplishment because average people are saying well I can really
[2:20:03.640 --> 2:20:09.480]  see it that come up to me that say Joe I can really see it you know the CNS is garbage
[2:20:09.480 --> 2:20:14.640]  they really are on attack I can't even watch him anymore so Trump has done that he's brought
[2:20:14.640 --> 2:20:18.240]  this awareness that's right remember CNN wanted to have fake news till he turned it around
[2:20:18.240 --> 2:20:22.440]  we come back in the final segment we'll talk about the new book media matters and how they
[2:20:22.440 --> 2:20:27.000]  get countered and how you think Trump should proceed I think he should bring out the insider
[2:20:27.000 --> 2:20:32.160]  trading bring out the conflicts of interest destroy gates destroy Fauci but they're going
[2:20:32.160 --> 2:20:36.200]  to continue to undermine the country put out this info and keep the lockdown going because
[2:20:36.200 --> 2:21:05.160]  it's that central group still running the shot out of the country we can't survive without

[2:21:43.800 --> 2:21:47.440]  a lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years and if you go back to those
[2:21:47.440 --> 2:21:54.320]  shows we laid out the AI takeover plan the tracking of cell phones how programmed master
[2:21:54.320 --> 2:22:00.240]  computers would manipulate control society how they'd be able to not just predict large
[2:22:00.240 --> 2:22:04.960]  groups of human movements and activities but even predict what individuals would do and
[2:22:04.960 --> 2:22:09.320]  then once you could predict what individuals were going to be doing you can add stimuli
[2:22:09.320 --> 2:22:14.880]  through the AI systems through the computers through digital billboards through face scanning
[2:22:14.880 --> 2:22:19.080]  through the social credit score to control people and make them act like you want it
[2:22:19.080 --> 2:22:24.520]  to when we cover that the media would attack us and say we were making it up it was a conspiracy
[2:22:24.520 --> 2:22:29.840]  theory even though it was in the actual corporate level blueprint documents well the next level
[2:22:29.840 --> 2:22:34.360]  of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control system
[2:22:34.360 --> 2:22:39.640]  to make humans obsolete and phase us out and it's something about a thousand times crazier
[2:22:39.640 --> 2:22:42.800]  than what Hitler planned so we might want to dismantle the system now
[2:22:42.800 --> 2:22:59.880]  it's the end of the world as we know it it's the end of the world as we know it it's the
[2:22:59.880 --> 2:23:06.520]  end of the world as we know it and I don't feel fun this entire takeover has been battle
[2:23:06.520 --> 2:23:12.880]  planned blueprinted war-gamed field marshaled by the psychological war chiefs at the united
[2:23:12.880 --> 2:23:18.840]  nations and the fortune 100 this is the post human takeover the news gets tighter when you
[2:23:18.840 --> 2:23:26.280]  comply not loser the entire COVID-19 operation as a hoax now they admit the quote death numbers
[2:23:26.280 --> 2:23:30.040]  are dropping because those are fake where they count people the data something else
[2:23:30.040 --> 2:23:34.360]  but it's all about how many cases there are and now they're saying most of the population
[2:23:34.360 --> 2:23:41.440]  will get it and then no one can go outside ever again it's totally insane it's a fraud
[2:23:41.440 --> 2:24:09.120]  it's all a lie you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:24:09.120 --> 2:24:14.280]  welcome back paul joseph watson's gonna host the fourth hour i literally have like 30 40
[2:24:14.280 --> 2:24:18.400]  incredible breaking stories we'll hit next segment after our guest leaves us john hoff
[2:24:18.400 --> 2:24:23.080]  the gateway punna dot com twin brother of jim hoff executive you know international business
[2:24:23.080 --> 2:24:27.600]  man writer for the site and he's been one of the top people exposing this and walking
[2:24:27.600 --> 2:24:33.840]  through it we're clearly seeing a multinational corporate takeover with contact treasures
[2:24:33.840 --> 2:24:38.000]  with the clinton foundation level initiative involved with billa melinda gates with these
[2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:42.560]  big corporations with the power to roll out a global social credit score they now admit
[2:24:42.560 --> 2:24:46.520]  that's what the plan is the environmentalists are saying thank god tourism's basically over
[2:24:46.520 --> 2:24:52.040]  it's bad for the earth the post industrial worlds here humans are bad wall street journal
[2:24:52.040 --> 2:24:57.200]  dreaming of the end of humanity this is really their dystopic coming out they had this on
[2:24:57.200 --> 2:25:02.840]  the drawing boards we know in event 201 and lockstep and others i think they exacerbated
[2:25:02.840 --> 2:25:08.200]  it and launched it early and made it about trump to try to get rid of him and i still
[2:25:08.200 --> 2:25:13.960]  think this hoax too in the rolling coo will fail if we get around the censors and get
[2:25:13.960 --> 2:25:18.080]  the truth out because people instinctively know the truth but it's so incredibly dangerous
[2:25:18.080 --> 2:25:23.480]  joe hoff i want to talk in closing about media matters that you brought up earlier who really
[2:25:23.480 --> 2:25:27.920]  when they you know when they click their heels together we jump and say hi openly run by
[2:25:27.920 --> 2:25:33.120]  george soros and where all this is going and then the new book that is on a whole other
[2:25:33.120 --> 2:25:38.520]  subject but really about the key to everything yeah great and alex let me add one more comment
[2:25:38.520 --> 2:25:42.640]  too about these numbers the thing that i wanted to point out last segment that i didn't i'm
[2:25:42.640 --> 2:25:47.600]  sorry was the fact that the one measurement that we can take that can really kind of tell
[2:25:47.600 --> 2:25:53.280]  us how bad this cove it is is to look at total deaths this year compared to prior years and
[2:25:53.280 --> 2:25:58.360]  we've done that now and when you look at them this year's deaths especially related to the
[2:25:58.360 --> 2:26:04.200]  flu center barely barely much greater than in prior years slow down and say that again
[2:26:04.200 --> 2:26:06.920]  we should have started the whole interview with this in fact when we post this to band
[2:26:06.920 --> 2:26:09.480]  out video later i want to put what you're about to say at the very front of the interview
[2:26:09.480 --> 2:26:14.800]  because we can put up the graph showing record testing but deaths have gone way down from
[2:26:14.800 --> 2:26:20.560]  what they claimed but let's look at last year's numbers compared to you know the flat line
[2:26:20.560 --> 2:26:24.240]  of death or the range of death compared to now and tell people the name of the article
[2:26:24.240 --> 2:26:28.240]  on gateway punn is the folks can find it we're going to be putting it up here shortly how
[2:26:28.240 --> 2:26:34.800]  about that good idea but but um as we have a phd who's provided us this information it's
[2:26:34.800 --> 2:26:39.440]  good analysis and again data is where we need to be we don't need to be listening to doctors
[2:26:39.440 --> 2:26:44.120]  right now we need to be listening to the data analysts let's start over tell people what
[2:26:44.120 --> 2:26:48.360]  you're about to break because we're in this right guys we've hired a he's scared to put
[2:26:48.360 --> 2:26:53.520]  his name up but we've hired a highly rated statistician to crunch the numbers and they're
[2:26:53.520 --> 2:26:56.960]  already looking at them and it's what you've already been saying where they take the death
[2:26:56.960 --> 2:27:00.360]  numbers of everybody else put them in the column but we're going to have you're doing
[2:27:00.360 --> 2:27:05.800]  the same thing i guess having a phd statistician show it so tell us what's coming yeah so what
[2:27:05.800 --> 2:27:10.400]  he's done is he's looked at the last five years of mortality rates throughout the us
[2:27:10.400 --> 2:27:14.320]  and he compares them to this year and we're seeing that there's no material increase
[2:27:14.320 --> 2:27:18.720]  and with the only exception is in new york and new jersey and new york city which is
[2:27:18.720 --> 2:27:25.360]  the worst so with the exception of that there's been no increase so not material not on a
[2:27:25.360 --> 2:27:31.520]  material basis so so that tells us this thing is not even close to a spanish flu that took
[2:27:31.520 --> 2:27:36.600]  two percent of the world's population this thing isn't isn't doing anything like that
[2:27:36.600 --> 2:27:42.120]  so i think that's where you can get around the bogus counting and and classifications
[2:27:42.120 --> 2:27:46.840]  that the cdc recommends it's just okay well let's just look at toll deaths and that's and
[2:27:46.840 --> 2:27:49.720]  that's how let me stop you let's spend the rest of the time on this because it's so bomb
[2:27:49.720 --> 2:27:53.800]  show you as a lay person i was a lay person and look at last year's numbers see they're
[2:27:53.800 --> 2:27:58.360]  the same you're before on average the same you're before hire but to have a statistician
[2:27:58.360 --> 2:28:02.800]  show it they can't get around this but here's the key and i know you know the answers why
[2:28:02.800 --> 2:28:08.080]  is new york a few areas of michigan because they're blue cities and states where they
[2:28:08.080 --> 2:28:13.480]  intubated people they admit that's what killed them and where they sent regular flu and regular
[2:28:13.480 --> 2:28:17.480]  pneumonia patients into nursing homes knowing they would get a death number and the only
[2:28:17.480 --> 2:28:22.000]  way you do that in 10 different democrat states that did it where you have most of death is
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:27.240]  it was premeditated please talk about that that's right and we did a study too we compared
[2:28:27.240 --> 2:28:32.720]  democratic grant states to republican on at least a two to one ratio you're more likely
[2:28:32.720 --> 2:28:39.040]  to die in a democrat state from the coven and then in a republican state we also the
[2:28:39.040 --> 2:28:45.560]  thing that we know we did we had some information of an individual that provides this some some
[2:28:45.560 --> 2:28:53.800]  really incredible data using artificial intelligence a i and he was able to determine that one
[2:28:53.800 --> 2:29:01.760]  of the major fund fundraisers for koalmo in new york was this this elderly care facility
[2:29:01.760 --> 2:29:10.280]  organization and they gave him a lot of money when he allowed covid patients and actually
[2:29:10.280 --> 2:29:15.320]  didn't just allow he mandated them to go back into the homes rather than protecting them
[2:29:15.320 --> 2:29:20.640]  like the desantis did down in down in florida what koalmo did is threw him back into the
[2:29:20.640 --> 2:29:26.280]  homes what the rationale for that is because the homes got a lot more money for a covid
[2:29:26.280 --> 2:29:32.640]  patient so he was paying back these people that gave to him in the prior election and
[2:29:32.640 --> 2:29:37.320]  it was about the money and they made a ton of money by throwing covid patients back into
[2:29:37.320 --> 2:29:43.680]  these homes and then it killed all these elderly people fifty thousand dollars extra when you
[2:29:43.680 --> 2:29:49.320]  get a covid patient and intubate them yeah and well it and i think it's even more than
[2:29:49.320 --> 2:29:54.040]  that new york alex i i believe it's a lot more that's just the baseline it's thirteen
[2:29:54.040 --> 2:29:58.480]  thousand if you have a covid patient and then it was thirty nine thousand if you intubate
[2:29:58.480 --> 2:30:04.280]  them you're right new york even had more yeah and and so when he did that he created all
[2:30:04.280 --> 2:30:09.160]  these deaths i think the guy should be uh should be investigated and and uh looked at
[2:30:09.160 --> 2:30:15.160]  for murder i mean what his policies did anybody knows that was that was the wrong thing to
[2:30:15.160 --> 2:30:22.080]  do it was insanity to throw um to throw these types of individuals back into the homes and
[2:30:22.080 --> 2:30:26.640]  where the elderly are which they're they are the target of this disease the covid it's
[2:30:26.640 --> 2:30:31.720]  it's the elderly and the sick and the and so and bill gates so happens to say he wants
[2:30:31.720 --> 2:30:36.480]  death panels here at old people so i guess it's all coming true yeah it's it's outrageous
[2:30:36.480 --> 2:30:40.880]  it's just outrageous so yeah we've seen all these medical organizations tied we've seen
[2:30:40.880 --> 2:30:46.920]  the democrats tied into with them uh the deep state organizations we're seeing these bogus
[2:30:46.920 --> 2:30:52.560]  numbers coming up today out of florida it's like every day and the american people you
[2:30:52.560 --> 2:30:57.320]  know need to wake up i mean this is just it's outrageous what's been going on and and i'll
[2:30:57.320 --> 2:31:01.160]  tell you one thing was outrageous i mean i'm in hong kong i'm talking to come some really
[2:31:01.160 --> 2:31:06.520]  high level executives and they're just admiring china for the fact that they uh had better
[2:31:06.520 --> 2:31:10.160]  numbers in the u.s. and they were able to shut it down in such a short period of time
[2:31:10.160 --> 2:31:14.880]  etc and i'm about ready to throw up listening these guys and a couple good friends of mine
[2:31:14.880 --> 2:31:19.640]  but that's what's going on with the media especially in asia and around the world china's
[2:31:19.640 --> 2:31:24.880]  done an incredible job of selling themselves as doing this great job of the corona virus
[2:31:24.880 --> 2:31:30.920]  when in fact uh you know they they they started this thing and maybe uh the the question is
[2:31:30.920 --> 2:31:36.040]  did they do it did they do it out of an accident but they did did they do it intentionally
[2:31:36.040 --> 2:31:42.120]  because their economy is absolutely being uh disseminated by trump he's just done an
[2:31:42.120 --> 2:31:46.400]  incredible they've lost the trade war so the globalist with china decided to release this
[2:31:46.400 --> 2:31:50.240]  right on time fouchy basically was funding most of the projects in the lab so was uh
[2:31:50.240 --> 2:31:55.880]  gage you can't have all those confluence together 2015 major publications point out that obama
[2:31:55.880 --> 2:32:00.040]  moved the illegal project to that lab this has obama deep state fingerprints all over
[2:32:00.040 --> 2:32:04.880]  it it sure does sure doesn't and obama was over in china not long ago either i don't
[2:32:04.880 --> 2:32:08.240]  know if any people people remember that but he was he did a visit to china i thought well
[2:32:08.240 --> 2:32:14.080]  that's kind of odd what's he doing over in china and um so who knows but trump's um you
[2:32:14.080 --> 2:32:17.520]  know trump's really done a number on their economy i've done a number of posts on that
[2:32:17.520 --> 2:32:21.200]  especially living in hong kong i could see it i could see how that economy had
[2:32:21.200 --> 2:32:24.800]  joe there's a new book and i know you don't want to plug your new book but i'm i'm trying

[2:34:59.800 --> 2:35:05.920]  inoculation but the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete that we
[2:35:05.920 --> 2:35:14.640]  are non-essential as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that
[2:35:14.640 --> 2:35:21.720]  people once had by design this isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into
[2:35:21.720 --> 2:35:27.920]  it's been preplanned organized globally and it's extremely predatory and through governmental
[2:35:27.920 --> 2:35:34.240]  actuaries and tax programs and regulations the central banks that control it all are
[2:35:34.240 --> 2:35:40.600]  able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power this is the truest form
[2:35:40.600 --> 2:35:47.720]  of technocracy fascism been on air in 26 years starting about 24 years ago I began to get

[2:36:28.760 --> 2:36:32.880]  they would just laugh me and say oh no way then I would give them the documents they
[2:36:32.880 --> 2:36:36.840]  would get very very scared you know the next time I saw them in a few months and say man

[2:37:48.880 --> 2:38:15.000]  it seems like yesterday it was long ago Jane it was lovely she was a queen my
[2:38:15.000 --> 2:38:23.440]  night there in the darkness with the radio playing low and the secrets that we shared
[2:38:23.440 --> 2:38:35.000]  mountains that we moved caught like a wildfire out of control till there was nothing left
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:43.320]  to burn and nothing left to prove and I remember and I remember welcome back ladies and gentlemen
[2:38:43.320 --> 2:38:47.920]  I'm your host Alex Jones still here on air thanks to God's good graces and your support
[2:38:47.920 --> 2:38:56.080]  your prayers your word of mouth to your focus yes the globalists that are running against
[2:38:56.080 --> 2:39:02.160]  the wind against God's will they're gonna fail all right let me hit this right now for
[2:39:02.160 --> 2:39:08.320]  you ladies and gentlemen look at these headlines right here BLM supporters celebrate death
[2:39:08.320 --> 2:39:16.080]  of mother shot dead for saying all lives matter when confronted by black racist thugs she
[2:39:16.080 --> 2:39:21.120]  said yes they matter but white lives matter too so they shot her dad Facebook Twitter
[2:39:21.120 --> 2:39:26.040]  the left is celebrating it saying thank God one less dead white or one more dead white
[2:39:26.040 --> 2:39:32.680]  person totally and absolutely sickening so let me just go ahead and start over with this
[2:39:32.680 --> 2:39:38.000]  article for you let's just focus in on a real person that got killed right here you know
[2:39:38.000 --> 2:39:45.480]  an overhead shot we're just gonna sit here for a moment and look at somebody that died
[2:39:45.480 --> 2:39:50.960]  and think about them for just a second because the globalists don't want us to humanize any
[2:39:50.960 --> 2:40:00.160]  of these people when George Floyd died I played the video and said it looked terrible I thought
[2:40:00.160 --> 2:40:04.680]  the officer was wrong and that he should get in trouble turned out he was on enough fentanyl
[2:40:04.680 --> 2:40:09.080]  to kill two grown men and was an excited delirium and had been fighting them for 20 minutes
[2:40:09.080 --> 2:40:12.680]  it had been asked me put on the ground the officer wasn't thinking being an idiot he
[2:40:12.680 --> 2:40:17.600]  actually knew him from the nightclub and was putting his knee on his crowded artery because
[2:40:17.600 --> 2:40:23.800]  of the training they were given in Minneapolis St. Paul which was horrible and he died I
[2:40:23.800 --> 2:40:28.080]  think that cop did that on purpose so he'd have a dead black guy so that he would get
[2:40:28.080 --> 2:40:33.240]  in trouble no cops don't want that even the most racist cops and there are racist cops
[2:40:33.240 --> 2:40:39.120]  of every color but when you see articles buried in the news every day of a black cop a white
[2:40:39.120 --> 2:40:45.440]  cop a Hispanic cop a white woman an old white man being shot being killed being murdered
[2:40:45.440 --> 2:40:50.400]  being stabbed it doesn't even hardly even make the news naturally and if they do they
[2:40:50.400 --> 2:40:56.080]  don't point out it's racial so look at this headline BLM supporters celebrate death of
[2:40:56.080 --> 2:41:02.720]  mother shot dead for saying all lives matter and they celebrate and then look at this left
[2:41:02.720 --> 2:41:11.160]  to celebrate Gislaine Maxwell a feminist icon who could bring down Trump prominent Democrats
[2:41:11.160 --> 2:41:15.760]  are saying oh she's gonna bring Trump down when Trump's not implicated it's the Clintons
[2:41:15.760 --> 2:41:23.280]  and others that are documented to be involved and that she's a sign of female power the
[2:41:23.280 --> 2:41:29.920]  left defends and promotes anything and everything that leftist engage in because Gislaine Maxwell
[2:41:29.920 --> 2:41:35.200]  was a leftist they're defending her when she helped traffic girls as young as five years
[2:41:35.200 --> 2:41:41.760]  of age reportedly that stories on info wars dot com with the links and that takes us to
[2:41:41.760 --> 2:41:46.080]  this next story and I'm about to break down another info wars dot com article that links
[2:41:46.080 --> 2:41:51.040]  to the Washington Post Associated Press you name it new court filings Gisling Maxwell

[2:41:58.760 --> 2:42:02.920]  here or they're saying she shouldn't be released on bond though some of the left are saying
[2:42:02.920 --> 2:42:06.440]  she should be because she tried to get out of the house and get away from them and they
[2:42:06.440 --> 2:42:11.400]  found her with a phone she was trying to get rid of wrapped in tinfoil now why would she
[2:42:11.400 --> 2:42:18.160]  do that because the big genius spy did not have one of these and now I'm going to plug
[2:42:18.160 --> 2:42:25.360]  this is a privacy pocket 1995 other people sell these with the copper Faraday cage for

[2:43:59.880 --> 2:44:06.120]  I don't do gimmicks and so to say like a furniture store will do going out of sale sale
[2:44:07.160 --> 2:44:11.160]  or oh last day of the sale and you drive by the signs up there for a month
[2:44:11.160 --> 2:44:13.800]  because that'll spur people on what the last day of the sale I don't do that
[2:44:15.560 --> 2:44:19.480]  when I tell you our supply chain is broken down and a lot of the products that we like to get
[2:44:19.480 --> 2:44:23.320]  that you like to buy we can't even get any more because the companies have gone out of business
[2:44:23.320 --> 2:44:27.480]  or they're short staffed or they can't get the ingredients that's really happening
[2:44:28.680 --> 2:44:32.120]  and that whole stack of news here about the breakdown of the food supply and the food chain
[2:44:32.120 --> 2:44:36.440]  now lockdown two is just going to create a total depression that'll make the worldwide depression
[2:44:36.440 --> 2:44:45.240]  that we already are in look tame nine products nine products that we have we can't get I said
[2:44:45.240 --> 2:44:48.680]  two yesterday it's actually three are just going to be discontinued because you can't get the
[2:44:48.680 --> 2:44:52.760]  ingredients that are proprietary anymore because the labs and places that put it out don't exist
[2:44:52.760 --> 2:44:59.800]  anymore maybe it's going to come back that's where we are so this is what happened over a year ago
[2:44:59.800 --> 2:45:04.280]  before the democratic party came after us we're selling colloidal silver toothpaste it was a best
[2:45:04.280 --> 2:45:07.960]  seller you know they can sell it at stores and sell it at wal-mart but we can't because we're bad
[2:45:07.960 --> 2:45:12.760]  we're about to follow lawsuit and we'll be back soon but you're saying where is the toothpaste
[2:45:12.760 --> 2:45:16.680]  well we didn't come out with this because we don't have the colloidal silver toothpaste
[2:45:16.680 --> 2:45:22.120]  this has been over a year in the making my dad's a retired dentist I said dad the listeners really
[2:45:22.120 --> 2:45:29.240]  want they're begging they're demanding for activated charcoal toothpaste so I started
[2:45:29.240 --> 2:45:35.640]  trying it and I said quite frankly big brand names are amazing I'll say at tom's main is like
[2:45:35.640 --> 2:45:40.040]  a great toothpaste next to our tooth whitening it'd be my favorite of I had vetted down the
[2:45:40.040 --> 2:45:43.480]  tooth whitening toothpaste I mean it's just amazing the way it goes in it strips everything off but
[2:45:43.480 --> 2:45:47.480]  still safely doesn't hurt the enamel the way it binds the things it's just amazing but it's full
[2:45:47.480 --> 2:45:51.240]  of fillers so those other big brands we can't sell this yet because there's something called
[2:45:52.200 --> 2:45:57.240]  a certificate of authenticity we already done all the other testing this isn't until next week
[2:45:57.240 --> 2:46:01.480]  to do the testing right now we know it's going to pass but I was about to launch this is my new
[2:46:01.480 --> 2:46:07.160]  sale this week till our FDA compliance officer came in and said you haven't gotten the certificate
[2:46:07.160 --> 2:46:15.080]  of authenticity on the toothpaste or the mouthwash yet it comes in on Monday so that's why I said
[2:46:15.080 --> 2:46:19.480]  the other sale a week past time to get rid of it because we're selling out of the products and
[2:46:20.120 --> 2:46:25.880]  stuffing coming in for months maybe never again we need to sell it at full price to fund ourselves
[2:46:25.880 --> 2:46:29.400]  and that's how sales work if you got a bunch of it you can sell it for sale but why sell it at
[2:46:29.400 --> 2:46:35.560]  sale if you're not going to have it anyway so that's kind of how this works ladies and gentlemen
[2:46:35.560 --> 2:46:41.560]  but then you guys are habituated not to buy something unless it's on sale so we like to do
[2:46:41.560 --> 2:46:49.800]  the sales that's how we fund the operation but to replace this sale because I am unable to bring
[2:46:49.800 --> 2:46:55.400]  you this this new product yet we are launching I was talking to Tim for Jan I said well what's the
[2:46:55.400 --> 2:46:58.920]  sale going to be because we're almost about to sell out all this stuff he said well a lot of other
[2:46:58.920 --> 2:47:03.000]  stuff we still have so you can still do the sell with that and leave the old stuff on there and
[2:47:03.000 --> 2:47:06.520]  hopefully that takes the weight off of that because the listeners love it because the truth is when
[2:47:06.520 --> 2:47:10.360]  we sell the stuff at 50 percent off we sell so much more that ends up making more money than
[2:47:10.360 --> 2:47:14.280]  going to full price but then it just habituates that it creates a bunch of problems then we
[2:47:14.280 --> 2:47:18.600]  got to sell even more and then it's a catch for me too so here's the deal you want it
[2:47:19.960 --> 2:47:24.440]  you got it you got the christmas in july sale it's the last sale store wide free shipping
[2:47:24.440 --> 2:47:30.120]  double patriot points but all the stuff like bio truce selenium superfilm of fatality extend
[2:47:30.120 --> 2:47:35.080]  to wise those are 50% off when they weren't rainforest plus 50% off when it wasn't turbo
[2:47:35.080 --> 2:47:38.680]  for 50% off when it wasn't survival shield x2 50% off when it wasn't
[2:47:39.960 --> 2:47:43.960]  lung and then all the stuff that was on sell lung cleanse vitamin refusion bodies ultra 12
[2:47:43.960 --> 2:47:49.080]  azobites dna forest winter plus winter seven plus living defense wasn't on there chill force wasn't
[2:47:49.080 --> 2:47:55.320]  on there and all other stuff wasn't on there so it's a big giant sale going and it funds the
[2:47:55.320 --> 2:48:00.600]  operation so i want to thank you all for your support i will run this through i'm going to
[2:48:00.600 --> 2:48:06.040]  say tuesday because we need to get the certificate other people don't get certificates we get them
[2:48:06.040 --> 2:48:10.040]  on okay because we know we're under attack we know when they try to come in here and arrest us we
[2:48:10.040 --> 2:48:15.960]  got everything we need plus we want you to get a product anyways i mean most of products we sell
[2:48:15.960 --> 2:48:21.640]  are above prop 65 california where there's more lead in the air than you could have in a product so
[2:48:21.640 --> 2:48:26.200]  that's the level of testing we do but it causes a problem uh too soon i'm not having stuff so
[2:48:26.200 --> 2:48:29.320]  hopefully we'll be able to stay in the new charcoal toothpaste next week we'll be right back
[2:48:32.600 --> 2:48:37.000]  so i was taking care of an errand this morning and i wasn't even closer downtown but i was parked
[2:48:37.000 --> 2:48:42.440]  the whole side street going to this business when i came back out i saw what looked like two
[2:48:43.000 --> 2:48:48.920]  asian folks probably chinese walking down the sidewalk about 50 yards up ahead of me and here
[2:48:48.920 --> 2:48:54.600]  i am parked a truck with the windows up and the woman stops and points at me so they stop
[2:48:54.600 --> 2:48:59.480]  and they wait while i'm inside my truck truck started and they sit there and stretch keeps
[2:48:59.480 --> 2:49:06.600]  pointing and they put their hands out like they're waiting for me to go because i'm not wearing a mask
[2:49:06.600 --> 2:49:13.160]  inside my car and so then i just sat there so they acted angry and walked past me i almost
[2:49:13.160 --> 2:49:17.880]  shot a video of it on my phone but everybody sees this stuff happening everywhere this has
[2:49:17.880 --> 2:49:23.000]  been a long list people are pulling guns on folks that aren't wearing masks this is all cult
[2:49:23.000 --> 2:49:28.760]  programming this is all about submitting we cannot submit to this un brainwashing it's all a giant
[2:49:28.760 --> 2:49:35.240]  fraud we must expose the fraud or become slaves to it i know what we'll do to make them conform to
[2:49:35.240 --> 2:49:40.040]  our cult we'll all tell them to wear masks or they're gonna die and then we'll release the
[2:49:40.040 --> 2:49:43.880]  pressure for a while and bring it back and squeeze it harder and release it again and we'll be the
[2:49:43.880 --> 2:49:49.240]  virtuous singers we'll be the angels even though our lord and master bill gates helped fund the whole
[2:49:49.240 --> 2:49:59.160]  covid-19 oh no don't seduce me that's right that's the code word for bill gates this operation he
[2:49:59.160 --> 2:50:06.760]  carries out with his good little buddy dr. Fauci in the surgeon cult as you know for girls there's
[2:50:06.760 --> 2:50:11.560]  five different types of villains they secretly desire in the romance novels one of them is the
[2:50:11.560 --> 2:50:18.760]  vampire the werewolf the billionaire and and who else oh that's right there's the surgeon and then
[2:50:18.760 --> 2:50:24.920]  there's one other one and it's so much fun to be ruled over by these psychotic psychopaths it's so good
[2:50:24.920 --> 2:50:31.000]  to know that there are masters and they're coming to rape us with their inoculations psychopaths are
[2:50:31.000 --> 2:50:46.920]  so high oh yeah you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:46.920 --> 2:50:54.920]  oh

[2:51:32.440 --> 2:51:36.360]  knows how to take charge for celebrating the poor white lady shot dead in st louis because
[2:51:36.360 --> 2:51:41.800]  she was white daughter of slain police officer accosted on twitter for hashtag blue lives matter
[2:51:42.680 --> 2:51:48.200]  these are i've never seen villains that behave this evil as black lives matter and left us
[2:51:51.160 --> 2:51:53.560]  but they've never had repercussions for the things they do
[2:51:56.360 --> 2:51:59.400]  i mean i grew up in dalis where if you look at somebody wrong they jump out of their car and
[2:51:59.400 --> 2:52:04.120]  start fighting so these leopards have never had repercussions jp morgan reports highest
[2:52:04.120 --> 2:52:08.760]  quarterly revenue ever despite coronavirus pandemic because they engineered the whole thing
[2:52:09.320 --> 2:52:12.680]  it's actually worried they're consolidating power the same thing with big tech they're
[2:52:12.680 --> 2:52:17.240]  taking over the economy and forcing us in you thought walmart was predatory this is beyond that
[2:52:19.400 --> 2:52:22.760]  and again i've got hundreds of articles i could sit here and read off but this is so important
[2:52:22.760 --> 2:52:29.960]  covid testing scandal 333 labs report 333 labs report in florida 100 people testing positive
[2:52:29.960 --> 2:52:35.880]  for corona that's how they panic you the wicked flea when none pursueth that's the bible verse
[2:52:36.760 --> 2:52:42.040]  but those that are with god are as strongest we fault the next verse guys the wicked flea when
[2:52:42.040 --> 2:52:46.920]  none pursueth but those are the spirit of god stand firm i think it's basically the verse i'm
[2:52:46.920 --> 2:52:52.040]  paraphrasing it but just think about that and everybody kind of quietly knows oh if you
[2:52:52.680 --> 2:52:56.200]  talk about that you might get banned on twitter or facebook so that people don't
[2:52:56.200 --> 2:53:03.000]  so the fraud continues video portland communist mistake random asian man for journalist andy
[2:53:04.040 --> 2:53:11.720]  NGO know and try to attack him because you know they think all asians look the same
[2:53:11.720 --> 2:53:15.880]  that's just how crazy these people are and more and more of them it turns out are weathermen
[2:53:15.880 --> 2:53:23.720]  and are terrorists and are involved in all of this crazy garbage but that's just the reality
[2:53:23.720 --> 2:53:31.960]  of the world that we live in and the reality of where all of this craziness has gone but the
[2:53:31.960 --> 2:53:38.200]  answer is don't give in to them don't let them make you submit because this agenda of covid-19

[2:56:23.320 --> 2:56:30.040]  that is the master of our own destinies ladies and gentlemen there is a war on reality a war on
[2:56:30.040 --> 2:56:36.120]  civilization a war on our health a war on our economy but being aware of it and standing up to it
[2:56:36.120 --> 2:56:47.080]  speaking out against it will defeat it so take action or be slaves transmitting worldwide from
[2:56:47.080 --> 2:56:54.120]  the summit dot news studios in the united kingdom you are listening to paul joseph watson
[2:56:56.200 --> 2:57:02.280]  oh the march of the hysterical covid will continue and it denotes itself as alex put
[2:57:02.280 --> 2:57:09.480]  a segment by who's wearing the mask and who isn't of course in america we've seen mass protests
[2:57:09.480 --> 2:57:15.800]  for racial justice we've also seen mass protests against lockdown laws um the only one apparently
[2:57:15.800 --> 2:57:21.880]  that covid 19 avoids in those instances is the blm protest because covid's now woke of course it has
[2:57:21.880 --> 2:57:27.320]  a gained sentient understanding of who it can infect and who it can't apparently based on their
[2:57:27.320 --> 2:57:35.080]  politics which goes straight to the fact as i said before the mass has become the political tool
[2:57:35.080 --> 2:57:41.480]  in america if you're not wearing the mask you're a filthy reprobate uh trump supporter another
[2:57:41.480 --> 2:57:50.200]  deplorable in the united kingdom you are a dirty racist bigoted brexit supporter if you're not wearing
[2:57:50.200 --> 2:57:55.720]  the mask and now in his infinite wisdom borris johnson who has got basically every coronavirus
[2:57:55.720 --> 2:58:02.120]  decision wrong at every step of the way is now saying he will introduce a new law which by the
[2:58:02.120 --> 2:58:09.320]  way won't take effect for 10 days forcing everyone to wear by a mandatory enforcement
[2:58:09.320 --> 2:58:16.280]  a coronavirus mask when they go into shops now if it's so important why isn't it already in place
[2:58:16.280 --> 2:58:20.760]  and why hasn't he announced it immediately he could have said from tomorrow when we had the
[2:58:20.760 --> 2:58:27.320]  lockdown borris johnson got up on television and said this takes effect from tomorrow this mandatory
[2:58:27.320 --> 2:58:33.880]  mask law is not even going to take effect for another 10 days if it's so important why we wait
[2:58:33.880 --> 2:58:39.240]  in 10 11 12 days until this takes effect and of course the only thing this is going to do
[2:58:39.240 --> 2:58:44.520]  is further hamstring the economic recovery quarter of the shops that i see in the high street are
[2:58:44.520 --> 2:58:50.680]  already closed or not even open yet and it's going to create yet another army of petty
[2:58:50.680 --> 2:58:56.440]  authoritarian enforcers we're going to get to the stage where going into a restaurant going
[2:58:56.440 --> 2:59:02.120]  into a shop going into a bar is almost as insufferable as going through airport security
[2:59:03.320 --> 2:59:12.360]  all for a virus which killed in the uk less people than the 2017 2018 blue season for a virus
[2:59:12.360 --> 2:59:17.800]  that has killed or will kill 50 000 cancer victims because they weren't able to get
[2:59:17.800 --> 2:59:22.600]  cancer treatment over the past three months because they were scared of going into hospitals
[2:59:22.600 --> 2:59:30.120]  or because those hospitals withdrew the treatment a virus that's going to cause 1.5 million tv
[2:59:30.120 --> 2:59:37.320]  infections globally deaths that is because again people aren't getting treatment i went to a
[2:59:37.320 --> 2:59:42.440]  restaurant the other day they've got they've got temperature scans they've got nhs track and trace
[2:59:42.440 --> 2:59:47.400]  they actually to put your information into a database so the government can track you down
[2:59:47.400 --> 2:59:52.680]  maybe knock on your door if you've broken the latest installation of the latest lockdown law
[2:59:53.560 --> 2:59:58.440]  now in cities in the uk like leicester and blackburn they're reintroducing all the previous
[2:59:58.440 --> 3:00:05.160]  lockdown laws as we said they would do turning the tap on and off on a whim i went into a
[3:00:05.160 --> 3:00:11.160]  restaurant the other day and it's not just the people enforcing this it's the rest of the population
[3:00:11.160 --> 3:00:16.360]  and if you look at the polls in the uk still the clear majority not only support current
[3:00:16.360 --> 3:00:20.680]  lockdown measures but want them to be toughened want them to go back to something that's even
[3:00:20.680 --> 3:00:27.880]  more draconian than we had back at the end of march and in april and if you get close to these
[3:00:27.880 --> 3:00:33.400]  screeching carons they will let you know about it i was in a restaurant the other night already
[3:00:33.400 --> 3:00:38.440]  got into the restaurant sat down on the table had the first course went to go to the back of the
[3:00:38.440 --> 3:00:46.200]  restaurant to go to the bathroom came back there were two carons waiting for the waiter to seat them
[3:00:46.200 --> 3:00:52.840]  politely said excuse me excuse me as i stood behind them twice no response completely lost
[3:00:52.840 --> 3:00:58.840]  in their own world on their phones so i walked past them and again what did they say that's not
[3:00:58.840 --> 3:01:06.360]  social distancing these people love it they love being given this petty power to abuse and harass
[3:01:06.360 --> 3:01:12.120]  everyone else i mean you've seen the videos out of america people going into walmart god forbid
[3:01:12.120 --> 3:01:18.680]  forgetting or refusing to wearing a mask they get publicly shamed and humiliated and that's just
[3:01:18.680 --> 3:01:25.800]  another reason to do that now headline out of summit news chair of met police federation says
[3:01:25.800 --> 3:01:32.600]  it will be impossible to enforce mandatory face masks in shops and given that what happened during
[3:01:32.600 --> 3:01:39.400]  the end of march april period when we literally had police in this country inspecting people's
[3:01:39.400 --> 3:01:45.640]  shopping bags to see if they've if they bought essential items and if they bought you know a
[3:01:45.640 --> 3:01:50.280]  couple of bottles of wine well that's not essential they were literally finding people for that
[3:01:51.080 --> 3:01:56.120]  they were literally finding people for allowing their children to play out in their back garden
[3:01:56.120 --> 3:02:02.280]  which wasn't even against the law now they're going to be empowered to find people for not
[3:02:02.280 --> 3:02:06.280]  wearing a mask but the chair of the london metropolitan police foundation says it will
[3:02:06.280 --> 3:02:11.720]  be quote nigh on impossible to enforce a new law which makes the wearing of face masks mandatory
[3:02:11.720 --> 3:02:18.440]  in all shops in england from july 24th given of course coronavirus deaths are at their lowest
[3:02:18.440 --> 3:02:25.480]  ever in scotland there's been zero coronavirus deaths for the past six days the virus is completely
[3:02:25.480 --> 3:02:32.440]  under control yet the lockdown measures are getting more stringent there's people who refuse or forget
[3:02:32.440 --> 3:02:37.880]  to wear the masks face a possible 100 pound fine for non-compliance but according to ken mar she
[3:02:37.880 --> 3:02:43.640]  represents police officers in london imposing the new law is virtually inconceivable he said quote
[3:02:44.360 --> 3:02:49.960]  we'll be driving around london looking for people who weren't wearing masks it's absolutely absurd
[3:02:49.960 --> 3:02:55.480]  of course given the stabbings haven't stopped the acid attacks haven't stopped the serious crimes
[3:02:55.480 --> 3:03:00.840]  haven't stopped we had police last year tell british citizens we're not going to respond to
[3:03:00.840 --> 3:03:05.000]  some burglaries because we don't have the staff we don't have the resources but they're going to be
[3:03:05.000 --> 3:03:12.360]  asked to respond to people who god forbid don't wear their face nappy their slave mask and this
[3:03:12.360 --> 3:03:17.480]  is the nub of it he pointed out the burden would fall on shopkeepers to stop refuse nicks although
[3:03:17.480 --> 3:03:23.000]  since they have no power to detain individuals would just leave before police could arrive so
[3:03:23.000 --> 3:03:30.120]  you're going to have this army of minimum wage shop attendants being given de facto police power
[3:03:30.120 --> 3:03:35.240]  to detain people it's obviously not going to work people are either going to start fights pick up a
[3:03:35.240 --> 3:03:42.280]  force and just walk out the shop pizza cowgill chairman of uk clothing outlet jd sports said
[3:03:42.280 --> 3:03:46.200]  that store employees shouldn't be expected to try to enforce the law and that the outcome would just
[3:03:46.200 --> 3:03:53.800]  be less people shopping i'm not going in a shop if i have to wear a mask that's the stupid thing
[3:03:53.800 --> 3:03:57.880]  about it this doesn't apply to going into a restaurant obviously because you've got to eat
[3:03:59.000 --> 3:04:04.680]  or going into a pub or going into a cinema which is even more of a confined environment than going
[3:04:04.680 --> 3:04:11.320]  into a shop it doesn't even make sense says well health authorities have repeatedly insisted that
[3:04:11.320 --> 3:04:16.920]  wearing face masks helps stop the spread of kovat 19 the evidence is dubious at best and i link to
[3:04:16.920 --> 3:04:24.600]  about 10 scientific investigations into the fact that wearing face masks according to numerous
[3:04:24.600 --> 3:04:31.080]  studies has no impact on the spread of the disease anyway as i point out in this article the who
[3:04:31.080 --> 3:04:37.240]  only advocated face masks after political lobbying despite the science being unconvincing they
[3:04:37.240 --> 3:04:43.160]  initially the world health organization studied the evidence and said there's no reason for everyone
[3:04:43.160 --> 3:04:48.120]  to be wearing face masks they were lobbied politically and then it suddenly became mandatory
[3:04:48.680 --> 3:04:54.200]  and in fact bbc news night admitted that when they reported quote the world health organization
[3:04:54.200 --> 3:05:00.200]  committee that reviewed the evidence for the use of face coverings in public didn't back them the
[3:05:00.200 --> 3:05:06.040]  preeminent supposed experts when they saw the scientific study said these face masks have no
[3:05:06.040 --> 3:05:14.040]  impact but after political lobbying the who now recommends them and of course everyone was wearing
[3:05:14.040 --> 3:05:21.800]  a face mask in hubei province right at the start of the outbreak in china in wuhan in all those
[3:05:21.800 --> 3:05:26.360]  surrounding areas didn't do them much good did it they were wearing the face masks before and
[3:05:26.360 --> 3:05:33.560]  during the outbreak and as toby young explains on at lockdownskeptics.org forcing people to wear
[3:05:33.560 --> 3:05:39.720]  face masks in shops will only deter more people from going shopping further damaging any chance of a
[3:05:39.720 --> 3:05:45.800]  proper economic recovery which of course when you've got a gdp that's been shaved off to the
[3:05:45.800 --> 3:05:52.680]  tune of 25 percent in this country that causes poverty in the long term that causes deaths you
[3:05:52.680 --> 3:05:57.560]  guys on to say one of the most depressing things about this government's dictate is that it will
[3:05:57.560 --> 3:06:02.280]  mean people are even less like likely to go shopping than they were when non-essential shops
[3:06:02.280 --> 3:06:08.280]  were allowed to reopen on July the 4th just looking at the high street as i was over the past few days
[3:06:08.280 --> 3:06:13.560]  over this weekend at least a quarter of the shops aren't even open anyway the quarter of the pubs
[3:06:13.560 --> 3:06:18.200]  aren't coming back everything's been completely devastated instead of realizing that instead
[3:06:18.200 --> 3:06:25.320]  of realizing that yes we have immune systems that yes we have herd immunity if it's allowed to process
[3:06:25.320 --> 3:06:31.480]  that way that's how we get beyond this we don't get beyond this by doubling down on mistake
[3:06:31.480 --> 3:06:36.440]  after mistake after mistake we'll get more into it on the other side breaking news at summit dot
[3:06:36.440 --> 3:06:43.320]  news we'll be right back let's go to one in Connecticut you're on the air thanks for holding

[3:08:38.520 --> 3:08:45.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:08:51.720 --> 3:08:57.240]  you're listening to the summit.news radio hour with paul joseph watson
[3:09:02.440 --> 3:09:05.320]  i see a lot of libertarians on twitter and elsewhere every day saying
[3:09:05.320 --> 3:09:10.520]  just wear the damn mask you've already i mean what level is that going to get to
[3:09:11.240 --> 3:09:17.160]  just take the damn vaccine just take the damn chip you've already sacrificed so many liberties
[3:09:17.160 --> 3:09:22.760]  at the drop of a hat in terms of freedom of movement freedom of assembly in terms of freedom
[3:09:22.760 --> 3:09:26.680]  of speech not being allowed to criticize the much-vaunted health authorities
[3:09:28.040 --> 3:09:34.120]  and now we're muscling ourselves and this is the thing everywhere i go if these masks are
[3:09:34.120 --> 3:09:39.640]  supposedly so important to prevent infections while everyone's touching them and then touching
[3:09:39.640 --> 3:09:45.800]  all these different surfaces why are they on the floor everywhere why do i see masks littering the
[3:09:45.800 --> 3:09:52.200]  streets littering the parks littering the shops i went in this restaurant there were masks inside
[3:09:52.200 --> 3:09:57.400]  the restaurant just on the floor people just dumping them everywhere if they're so infectious
[3:09:58.040 --> 3:10:02.440]  if you need to be so careful about this whole mass situation why you throwing them on the floor
[3:10:02.440 --> 3:10:07.880]  inside buildings not even out on the street the park is littered with them
[3:10:09.800 --> 3:10:14.760]  now they're going to be mandatory because borris johnson is a complete idiot who's caved to the
[3:10:14.760 --> 3:10:20.200]  most alarmist hysterical morons who we're never going to vote for him pretty funny how borris
[3:10:20.200 --> 3:10:25.640]  johnson supposedly like trump we had some of the same hysteria you know borris derangement syndrome
[3:10:25.640 --> 3:10:31.400]  is supposedly this right wing fascist about to institute authoritarianism yet when he does institute
[3:10:31.400 --> 3:10:38.120]  some aspects of at least low-level authoritarianism his enemies all love it they all support it the
[3:10:38.120 --> 3:10:44.760]  polls show that 80 plus of people support this meanwhile half of them aren't even back at work
[3:10:44.760 --> 3:10:50.680]  yet they're still getting paid by the government until october a lot of those are public employees
[3:10:50.680 --> 3:10:55.560]  so they know they've got a job to go back to meanwhile people in the private sector are completely
[3:10:55.560 --> 3:11:02.120]  screwed and borris johnson's exacerbating that by reintroducing all these lockdown measures
[3:11:03.000 --> 3:11:06.680]  there's an excellent article about this which i'm going to try and get through most of it now
[3:11:07.400 --> 3:11:13.880]  that spiked online by brendan o'neill it's called muscling the public why i'm against mandatory
[3:11:13.880 --> 3:11:19.480]  mass wearing and he makes the point that this is about separating people into different classes
[3:11:19.480 --> 3:11:26.600]  in america deplorable trump supporters and leftist democrats and in the uk corbyn easter left wing
[3:11:26.600 --> 3:11:33.880]  types and bigoted racist brexit supporters he says in his article here come the sneerers their
[3:11:33.880 --> 3:11:39.640]  target this time anyone who expresses even a tiny amount of skepticism about mandatory mask wearing
[3:11:39.640 --> 3:11:47.640]  in shops within hours mask skeptics have become the new climate change deniers yes they're gonna
[3:11:47.640 --> 3:11:51.800]  stick that one on us as well they're gonna say that we're killing granny oh you can have 50 000
[3:11:51.800 --> 3:11:58.360]  people for a blm protest so that's fine the granny killers they're sociopaths they're the kind of
[3:11:58.360 --> 3:12:03.000]  people who care more for their right to breathe all over the fruit and veg and they do the continued
[3:12:03.000 --> 3:12:08.760]  existence of people over the age of 20 of 75 the speed with which mask skepticism has been turned
[3:12:08.760 --> 3:12:15.400]  into a foul blast for me the only thick people who probably voted for brexit would ever engage in
[3:12:15.400 --> 3:12:21.160]  confirms that this latest manifestation of the culture wars has very little to do with masks
[3:12:21.160 --> 3:12:27.400]  that's exactly the point just like covid the mask has been vehemently politicized which is why you
[3:12:27.400 --> 3:12:34.120]  see all these videos on twitter of people being doxxed harassed publicly humiliated with the videos
[3:12:34.120 --> 3:12:41.800]  posted of them daring to descend against the high priest class of mask wearers you guys want to say
[3:12:41.800 --> 3:12:46.760]  boris johnson has announced that it will be mandatory to wear masks in shops in england from 24th of
[3:12:46.760 --> 3:12:52.600]  july we should all talk about this right we should weigh it up discuss the efficacy of masks and the
[3:12:52.600 --> 3:12:58.200]  desirability of empowering the police to take a hundred pounds off someone who dares to show his
[3:12:58.200 --> 3:13:04.200]  face in public like a polite a public health version of the morality guards in afghanistan
[3:13:04.200 --> 3:13:09.160]  who would whip women with a stick if they ever committed the crime of unmasking their face
[3:13:09.160 --> 3:13:15.480]  in public i mean is it going to get that bad you've seen the roaming religious police fans in
[3:13:15.480 --> 3:13:22.120]  countries like iran smacking people with canes and whips for letting their burka slip are we
[3:13:22.120 --> 3:13:27.320]  going to get a similar thing over here apparently that's libertarian now according to a lot of
[3:13:27.320 --> 3:13:32.200]  so-called libertarians there's apparently not apparently you would have to be a co-vidiot
[3:13:33.000 --> 3:13:37.880]  a mad libertarian to want to discuss the latest development the right thing to do is vigorously
[3:13:37.880 --> 3:13:43.480]  nod your head in agreement with the tori government don your mask and muzzle your opinions and now he
[3:13:43.480 --> 3:13:49.000]  makes the point about the authoritarianism which they're apparently keen on embracing despite the
[3:13:49.000 --> 3:13:53.880]  fact that seven months ago they were all telling us that boris johnson was an author authoritarian
[3:13:53.880 --> 3:13:59.640]  dictator that was going to impose the total totalitarian system of government now he's doing
[3:13:59.640 --> 3:14:04.600]  that at least on the low level they all love it he says it's remarkable that it's always the people
[3:14:04.600 --> 3:14:09.800]  who spent the past year or so telling us that boris and his crew were fascists who have unquestionably
[3:14:09.800 --> 3:14:17.640]  embraced every co-vid related dictate issued by boris's government stay in our homes for three
[3:14:17.640 --> 3:14:22.600]  months you got it don't engage in sexual relations with people we don't live with sure thing wear a
[3:14:22.600 --> 3:14:28.840]  mask in public yes sir the most fanatical lockdown lovers tend to be found amongst the millennial
[3:14:28.840 --> 3:14:35.080]  left in corbin east the circles in the pages of liberal broadsheets and of course among public
[3:14:35.080 --> 3:14:39.560]  sector workers who know they'll have a job at the end of all this unlike many private sector
[3:14:39.560 --> 3:14:44.280]  workers who are completely screwed because a quarter of the shops on the high street are shutting down
[3:14:45.800 --> 3:14:50.200]  so it isn't surprising that these masochistic middle classes are now fuming against mask
[3:14:50.200 --> 3:14:55.880]  skeptics do as you're told they're essentially saying and they're saying it in person they get
[3:14:55.880 --> 3:15:00.840]  very angry if you try to get past them in restaurants they scream in your face because now they have the
[3:15:00.840 --> 3:15:06.920]  power also i've noticed that the people who wear the masks are the most likely to get as close as
[3:15:06.920 --> 3:15:12.280]  to you as possible because again you're not in the cult they're in the cult they can do what they
[3:15:12.280 --> 3:15:18.680]  want they can violate social distancing to the end degree if you put a foot wrong though they'll
[3:15:18.680 --> 3:15:27.000]  get in your face he goes on to say the clamp down on mass skepticism is motored by the usual
[3:15:27.000 --> 3:15:33.400]  hatreds of the cultural witness james o'brien lbc's privately educated mocker of the dim masses
[3:15:33.400 --> 3:15:37.800]  putting out a video in which he discusses the possibility that anti-mask people are brexit
[3:15:37.800 --> 3:15:45.880]  voters that's how it politicize of course they are the thick sh it's the snobs even have a study
[3:15:45.880 --> 3:15:50.280]  now to confirm their prejudices against mass skeptics daily mail reports that researchers
[3:15:50.280 --> 3:15:54.200]  in the u.s. have found that people who refuse to wear a mask or comply with social distancing
[3:15:54.200 --> 3:16:01.320]  have lower cognitive ability real covariance as the mail sums them up so again it's about
[3:16:01.320 --> 3:16:07.400]  differentiating between the deplorables between the bigots between the racists and the good people
[3:16:08.040 --> 3:16:15.640]  who do exactly as they're told and wear the masks he says in certain circles mask wearing
[3:16:15.640 --> 3:16:21.080]  will become a form of distinction a way of distinguishing yourself from brainwash cretins
[3:16:21.080 --> 3:16:28.760]  and showing you're a good person again the kind of hateful idiots who will scream in your face while
[3:16:28.760 --> 3:16:34.360]  claiming to be good people masks will become moral garments public demonstrations of decency
[3:16:34.360 --> 3:16:41.160]  not unlike in afghanistan he says we cannot let let mask wearing become the new normal
[3:16:41.160 --> 3:16:45.960]  that's a horrible they're stuffy and claustrophobic they make it hard to read people's faces they
[3:16:45.960 --> 3:16:51.960]  alienate us from each other even more hiding smiles and discouraging chit chat and actually
[3:16:51.960 --> 3:16:56.280]  worsened the culture of fear by spreading the idea that our fellow citizens are walking diseases
[3:16:56.280 --> 3:17:01.640]  who must be muzzled and kept at a safe distance only people comfortable with the contemporary
[3:17:01.640 --> 3:17:06.920]  social atomization that has been intensified by the lockdown would embrace mandatory mask
[3:17:06.920 --> 3:17:13.960]  wearing with no questions whatsoever some of us dislike atomization we want connection community
[3:17:13.960 --> 3:17:20.120]  engagement and so we believe that mask wearing should be voluntary or we allowed to say that
[3:17:20.120 --> 3:17:25.320]  well apparently not because as we've seen over the past few months disagreeing with the health
[3:17:25.320 --> 3:17:30.120]  authorities will get you censured and polite circles it will get you banned on social media
[3:17:30.120 --> 3:17:35.320]  again because we can't question the same people who got most of this wrong from the very beginning
[3:17:35.320 --> 3:17:40.280]  don't go away we'll be right back a lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years and if
[3:17:40.280 --> 3:17:46.840]  you go back to those shows we laid out the ai takeover plan the tracking of cell phones how
[3:17:46.840 --> 3:17:52.520]  programmed master computers would manipulate control society how they'd be able to not just
[3:17:52.520 --> 3:17:57.720]  predict large groups of human movements and activities but even predict what individuals
[3:17:57.720 --> 3:18:01.960]  would do and then once you could predict what individuals were going to be doing you can add
[3:18:01.960 --> 3:18:07.880]  stimuli through the ai systems through the computers through digital billboards through
[3:18:07.880 --> 3:18:12.760]  face scanning through the social credit score to control people and make them act like you wanted
[3:18:12.760 --> 3:18:18.280]  to but when we cover that the media would attack us and say we were making it up it was a conspiracy
[3:18:18.280 --> 3:18:23.640]  theory even though it was in the actual corporate level blueprint documents well the next level of
[3:18:23.640 --> 3:18:28.600]  the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control system to make humans
[3:18:28.600 --> 3:18:33.880]  obsolete and phase us out and it's something about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler
[3:18:33.880 --> 3:18:39.240]  planned so we might want to dismantle the system now one of our best-selling products is living
[3:18:39.240 --> 3:18:43.960]  defense and it's been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients
[3:18:43.960 --> 3:18:47.880]  that are organic we've got a limited supply right now but it's selling out fast and i want those of
[3:18:47.880 --> 3:18:52.360]  you that haven't experienced living defense to get it for yourself here just part of one testimonial
[3:18:52.360 --> 3:18:58.280]  i look in january 2016 i went in a hospital i went to va hospital out here in boasting i was in until
[3:18:58.280 --> 3:19:03.240]  june and one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to info wars
[3:19:03.240 --> 3:19:08.120]  three hours a day and i kept hearing dr group and all you guys talking about living defense let me
[3:19:08.120 --> 3:19:13.320]  tell you something man i had an internal digestive problem and i stumbled with it for about five or
[3:19:13.320 --> 3:19:17.720]  six years and the doctors they tried every time nobody could figure out what it is and in every
[3:19:17.720 --> 3:19:21.960]  day when i kept hearing you and dr group and those commercials i said you know what i'm gonna get me
[3:19:21.960 --> 3:19:25.400]  some of that freaking living defense now i wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they
[3:19:25.400 --> 3:19:30.040]  don't want you to have a stuff but i ordered it had it shipped to me i got it i hid it from the nurses
[3:19:30.040 --> 3:19:35.960]  i started taking it man that stuff changed my life it saved my life alex jones and info wars
[3:19:35.960 --> 3:19:41.720]  saved my life the reasons that the globalist launched this planetary lockdown the number
[3:19:41.720 --> 3:19:49.080]  one reason is it serves every one of their purposes we've gone over those purposes many times here on
[3:19:49.080 --> 3:19:55.080]  air the casual society the surveillance system global government medical tyranny forced inoculation
[3:19:55.960 --> 3:20:02.360]  but the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete that we are non-essential
[3:20:03.160 --> 3:20:10.680]  as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had
[3:20:10.680 --> 3:20:17.640]  by design this isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into it's been pre-planned
[3:20:17.640 --> 3:20:25.080]  organized globally and it's extremely predatory and through governmental actuaries and tax programs
[3:20:25.080 --> 3:20:31.800]  and regulations the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers
[3:20:31.800 --> 3:20:36.760]  and consolidate power this is the truest form of technocracy fascism
[3:20:36.760 --> 3:20:45.720]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:56.120 --> 3:21:01.720]  live from the summit dot news headquarters it's paul joseph watson
[3:21:01.720 --> 3:21:09.240]  now we're going to get into a tucker call some video with where he's talking about the attack
[3:21:09.240 --> 3:21:15.880]  on religious icons in the aftermath of these plm riots finishing off on that mass point though
[3:21:15.880 --> 3:21:19.560]  a lot of people have expressed the opinion that this is a measure introduced by boris
[3:21:19.560 --> 3:21:25.400]  johnson to give people more confidence to go out into the streets more confidence to go into shops
[3:21:25.400 --> 3:21:30.120]  and spend their money but from everything i've read from the commentary that's arrived in the
[3:21:30.120 --> 3:21:34.360]  aftermath of this new law being introduced it's going to have the opposite effect it's going to
[3:21:34.360 --> 3:21:40.040]  make people less likely to want to go out given that they're being forced not just to wear the mask
[3:21:40.040 --> 3:21:44.840]  but to go through all this rigmarole merely to get into a shop in fact there's an article on
[3:21:44.840 --> 3:21:51.320]  spotnik called masks are all about the economy not safety where the author writes killing off
[3:21:51.320 --> 3:21:56.120]  the high street now people are very concerned about going out again which is why pubs are not
[3:21:56.120 --> 3:22:01.240]  being besieged and are operating on at least 50 lower takings the same is happening on the high
[3:22:01.240 --> 3:22:07.480]  street why would you go shopping in town when you have to queue to get into every shop and you're
[3:22:07.480 --> 3:22:14.440]  treated like a leper by an assistant in a mass asking if you you've hand sanitized and now
[3:22:14.440 --> 3:22:20.920]  these assistants are going to be empowered with basically de facto police powers to detain people
[3:22:20.920 --> 3:22:24.280]  it's going to be a complete disaster but that's what the bosses are probably going to tell them to
[3:22:24.280 --> 3:22:29.880]  do we've seen the videos out of walmart out of target in america where these carons who run the
[3:22:29.880 --> 3:22:36.600]  place the staff members not only try to detain but try to publicly humiliate and harass people who
[3:22:36.600 --> 3:22:42.200]  dare not wear a mask he continues to say then you can't touch the clothes or even try the shoes on
[3:22:42.760 --> 3:22:47.480]  that's right you go clothes shopping you're not even allowed to touch the clothes what's the point
[3:22:47.480 --> 3:22:55.000]  you're just not going to go you're just going to go online if that he says no wonder people are
[3:22:55.000 --> 3:22:59.400]  practicing real social distancing and shopping from the safety of their own homes via the internet
[3:22:59.400 --> 3:23:05.160]  the high street and town sensors were already dying before covid but borris's mandatory face mask law
[3:23:05.160 --> 3:23:09.640]  will be the final death flow for our town centers it will have the opposite effects of the one he
[3:23:09.640 --> 3:23:16.440]  intends the shoppers will stay away now rented about that for about 35 minutes so we're going to move
[3:23:16.440 --> 3:23:23.000]  on fox news reports catholic churches burned vandalized over the weekend as police investigate
[3:23:23.000 --> 3:23:27.560]  where's the outrage and this was the subject of tucker colson's interview last night
[3:23:27.560 --> 3:23:34.200]  gonna roll that clip right now here it is well the mob has turned its focus from american history
[3:23:34.200 --> 3:23:40.200]  to christianity over the weekend vandals in boston torched a statue of the virgin mary outside a
[3:23:40.200 --> 3:23:45.160]  church in new york they defaced a statue of the virgin mary in front of a catholic school
[3:23:45.160 --> 3:23:50.280]  in florida a man drove his car into a church as it was preparing for sunday mass he then dumped
[3:23:50.280 --> 3:23:55.160]  gasoline in the entryway and set the building on fire in the state of california historic church
[3:23:55.160 --> 3:24:01.800]  was destroyed completely by flames as it prepared to celebrate its 250th anniversary local fire
[3:24:01.800 --> 3:24:06.440]  department suggested it may have had something to do with outrage from the mob directed at
[3:24:06.440 --> 3:24:12.440]  juniper osara that was the founder of california's mission system as churches burned and statues
[3:24:12.440 --> 3:24:17.720]  were defaced former democratic party leader howard dean of the dumbest person ever to run the dnc
[3:24:17.720 --> 3:24:22.920]  tweeted this unfortunately christians don't have much of a reputation for anything but hate
[3:24:22.920 --> 3:24:28.280]  these days thanks to franklin graham and jerry fallwell and other trump friends end quote
[3:24:29.480 --> 3:24:33.800]  eric butaxis is a christian he's the author of the book if you can keep it the forgotten promise
[3:24:33.800 --> 3:24:39.320]  of american liberty and also of maybe the single best biography of martin luther he joins us
[3:24:39.320 --> 3:24:45.720]  so eric thanks so much for coming on so here you have the former head of the dnc attacking christianity
[3:24:45.720 --> 3:24:52.520]  as a religion of hate and its disciples as haters imagine howard dean saying that about any other
[3:24:52.520 --> 3:24:57.720]  religion what would the response be do you think listen you gotta give howard dean a pass he's a
[3:24:57.720 --> 3:25:04.760]  jughead you cannot take him seriously uh here's the issue when you start to scapegoat christians
[3:25:04.760 --> 3:25:08.680]  and you say it's because of them that these things are happening unfortunately you fall
[3:25:08.680 --> 3:25:15.720]  into the trap of being like the emperor nero when roam burned and of course uh he could have done
[3:25:15.720 --> 3:25:22.360]  something about it and he didn't he blamed the christians it's very convenient uh it's happening
[3:25:22.360 --> 3:25:31.160]  now i think a lot of the nastiness that is being directed at these statues uh it really has to do
[3:25:31.160 --> 3:25:37.080]  with something deeper tucker i hate to say it but uh there's something very dark you saw this in the
[3:25:37.080 --> 3:25:43.640]  french revolution there was a hatred at the bottom of it of god of any kind of authority
[3:25:44.600 --> 3:25:50.600]  and these people are drunk with the idea that they can you know somehow be in authority themselves
[3:25:50.600 --> 3:25:56.920]  that they can seize power and if you really want to cut to the chase you forget about statues of
[3:25:56.920 --> 3:26:04.200]  generals and things you you you go right for god you go right for uh the virgin mary my goodness
[3:26:04.200 --> 3:26:10.920]  you go you go for churches you cut to the chase of the some place uh in mobi dick one of the greatest
[3:26:10.920 --> 3:26:18.920]  novels ever written by a great american uh he talks about ahab who's consumed with rage wanting to
[3:26:18.920 --> 3:26:24.520]  strike through the mask in other words sort of to punch a hole in the sky and and murder god
[3:26:24.520 --> 3:26:30.680]  that's really where the source of hatred is coming from it's a hatred of god and a sense of deep
[3:26:30.680 --> 3:26:36.120]  injustice that's what we're talking about here we're talking about something that goes way beyond
[3:26:36.120 --> 3:26:42.120]  confederate generals i think i think you're right the acknowledgement of god suggests that you're
[3:26:42.120 --> 3:26:45.720]  not the ultimate authority that there's someone more powerful than you and our leaders can't
[3:26:45.720 --> 3:26:51.080]  stand it i do think though the christian leaders play a role in this i mean muslim leaders to their
[3:26:51.080 --> 3:26:58.280]  credit if they watched mosques burn and right islamic monuments be defaced the islamic center in
[3:26:58.280 --> 3:27:03.880]  washington they would not put up with it for one second they would say something i don't see christian
[3:27:03.880 --> 3:27:08.920]  leaders doing the same and i don't know why well i'll tell you why there are many christian leaders
[3:27:08.920 --> 3:27:15.720]  who don't understand the bible um when david killed goliath it wasn't like before he became a christian
[3:27:15.720 --> 3:27:23.000]  and then he became a christian and he repented no we celebrate david killing goliath there are many
[3:27:23.000 --> 3:27:31.560]  instances of scripture where people fight uh elijah the prophet is sarcastic that has been lost
[3:27:31.560 --> 3:27:37.240]  there are many people they've got a watered down kind of christianity they're offended by
[3:27:37.240 --> 3:27:44.040]  trump they seem to think that being nice is what it means to be a christian well if someone is
[3:27:44.040 --> 3:27:48.840]  raping a family member and you sit there and you say well i'm going to pray about it but i'm not
[3:27:48.840 --> 3:27:54.920]  going to try to stop that it brings us really to bonhoeffer bonhoeffer understood that the most
[3:27:54.920 --> 3:28:01.000]  christian thing he could do was participate in a plot to kill hitler because he understood there
[3:28:01.000 --> 3:28:05.960]  were victims when you know that there are people suffering if you don't do something about it
[3:28:05.960 --> 3:28:12.520]  you are to blame and actually interestingly when christal knock happened bonhoeffer knew that this
[3:28:12.520 --> 3:28:18.360]  attack on the jews by these mobs as far as i'm concerned who were animated by the spirit of antichrist
[3:28:18.360 --> 3:28:23.320]  these were these were not just political mobs there's something deeper and darker he understood
[3:28:23.320 --> 3:28:30.360]  that this attack on the synagogues it was an attack on god himself there's a there's a rage
[3:28:30.360 --> 3:28:35.720]  and a sense of envy that you know i don't like to use the word too lightly but there's something
[3:28:35.720 --> 3:28:43.000]  satanic about it there's something about it that is an unbridled roaring fury uh and if you if you
[3:28:43.000 --> 3:28:48.920]  don't treat it in the way that it needs to be treated if you don't uh deal with it uh right
[3:28:48.920 --> 3:28:56.200]  with with some force really then you are allowing other people to be harmed and any christian leader
[3:28:56.920 --> 3:29:04.200]  who doesn't understand that this is a marxist violent organization this has nothing to do
[3:29:04.200 --> 3:29:10.920]  anymore with with george floyd and with and with that they've hijacked this and everything
[3:29:10.920 --> 3:29:17.080]  they want to do they want to burn down everything that has been built by good people over centuries
[3:29:17.080 --> 3:29:23.480]  most of whom of course were christians you have a right and we need to preserve the right to live
[3:29:23.480 --> 3:29:27.080]  in this country as a faithful christian period and and our leader should help i think eric
[3:29:27.080 --> 3:29:33.240]  mtaxis thank you for that analysis really always good to see you thank you now sticking with the

[3:29:48.600 --> 3:29:53.880]  for this horrific murder by claiming that one of this mother's friends had used the n word there
[3:29:53.880 --> 3:29:59.880]  was a confrontation in indianapolis after a fourth of july celebration with this young mother her

[3:36:21.880 --> 3:36:28.440]  com i talked about the um young mother who was shot in the head for saying all lives matter
[3:36:28.440 --> 3:36:33.560]  back on july the fourth you would think the media would be interested in that didn't really turn
[3:36:33.560 --> 3:36:37.640]  out to be the case they dropped it like a hot potato after a couple of days because the narrative
[3:36:37.640 --> 3:36:44.120]  didn't fit then a bunch of blm supporters by the way i've had death threats from
[3:36:44.840 --> 3:36:50.760]  feminists i've had death threats from islamic extremists over the years many death threats
[3:36:50.760 --> 3:36:56.280]  never did they ever come close to equaling the number of violent and death threats i've received
[3:36:56.280 --> 3:37:02.680]  from the lm supporters who are obviously the nicest people because now they've raided the public
[3:37:02.680 --> 3:37:09.320]  facebook page of jessica whitaker the woman that was shot in the head in indianapolis for saying
[3:37:09.320 --> 3:37:15.320]  why lives matter one of them said quote racist racial is pushing daisies and the streets are a
[3:37:15.320 --> 3:37:21.080]  little safer another one said can't feel bad when you used a racial slur and acted like an effing
[3:37:21.080 --> 3:37:28.760]  fool so if you literally they're saying you deserve to be shot in the head your son deserves to grow
[3:37:28.760 --> 3:37:34.600]  up without a mother because you said all lives matter these are the reasonable people these are
[3:37:34.600 --> 3:37:39.800]  the people being given power by the cultural institutions that control our society what could
[3:37:39.800 --> 3:37:45.080]  possibly go wrong another one said black lives matter the rest of you are next
[3:37:47.320 --> 3:37:52.600]  another one said party party for safer communities along with a gif image of carlton from the
[3:37:52.600 --> 3:37:59.320]  fresh prince of belair dancing they were literally posting celebration dancing gifts on the public
[3:37:59.320 --> 3:38:06.040]  facebook page of a murder victim who was shot in the head for saying for the crime of saying white
[3:38:06.040 --> 3:38:10.440]  lives matter these are the kind of people we're dealing with and these are the kind of people
[3:38:10.440 --> 3:38:18.040]  supported by virtually every major corporation in america including the nba nba store refuses to
[3:38:18.040 --> 3:38:25.400]  sell free hong kong jersey but does sell kill cop shirts now this came out last night if you go on
[3:38:25.400 --> 3:38:33.480]  the nba store you can choose the name which is used to emblazern your choice of nba team jersey
[3:38:33.480 --> 3:38:39.480]  and you can have it say kill cops you can have it say a number of other anti cop messages some of
[3:38:39.480 --> 3:38:46.040]  them violent but if you try to put in free hong kong your order will be denied and that was
[3:38:46.040 --> 3:38:53.640]  confirmed by nearest people from what i saw last they've removed the kill cops jersey but right up
[3:38:53.640 --> 3:38:59.560]  until last night that was perfectly acceptable according to the nba and of course this goes back
[3:38:59.560 --> 3:39:05.160]  to their tacit support for the communist chinese regime that has oppressed democracy activists
[3:39:05.160 --> 3:39:10.520]  since riots erupted last year and of course recently passed the notorious national security law
[3:39:10.520 --> 3:39:14.840]  which makes it easier that easier for china to target and punish dissidents within hong kong
[3:39:15.640 --> 3:39:21.400]  of course this all started with the nba as a result of houston rocket's general manager darin
[3:39:21.400 --> 3:39:26.920]  darryl moary tweeting in support of the hong kong protest movement which then prompted china to pull
[3:39:26.920 --> 3:39:33.000]  almost all sponsorship and nba broadcast forcing the nba into a groveling apology and then of course
[3:39:33.000 --> 3:39:38.200]  in the aftermath whenever anyone tried to ask a question about it in nba press conferences
[3:39:38.200 --> 3:39:45.560]  they had their mics cut and they were immediately shut down oh but the nba is so woke domestically
[3:39:45.560 --> 3:39:51.560]  when it comes to a regime that literally puts muslims in concentration camps and locks up protesters
[3:39:51.560 --> 3:39:57.800]  not too concerned about that because they know where the money's coming from meanwhile back in
[3:39:57.800 --> 3:40:05.480]  clown world uk uk police brag about arresting 12 year old boy for offensive social media posts
[3:40:05.480 --> 3:40:11.400]  and of course the entirety of the media every cultural institution and the multi-billion
[3:40:11.400 --> 3:40:16.280]  dollar industry that is the premier league all through their support behind this multimillionaire
[3:40:16.280 --> 3:40:23.240]  footballer meanwhile the life of a 12 year old boy is ruined forever and he's the villain of the
[3:40:23.240 --> 3:40:28.440]  peace uk police bragged about arresting a 12 year old boy for offensive social media posts sent to
[3:40:28.440 --> 3:40:34.360]  a multimillionaire premier league footballer the child was arrested after he sent racist messages
[3:40:34.360 --> 3:40:40.200]  to wilfred zohar telling the crystal palace star you better not score tomorrow you black
[3:40:40.200 --> 3:40:47.880]  cunt so instead of ignoring this and realizing that this was the stupid antics of a literal child
[3:40:48.840 --> 3:40:56.120]  mr. zohar tweeted it out to his 800 000 twitter followers along with a screenshot of the child's
[3:40:56.120 --> 3:41:02.040]  instagram page no doubt he was immediately doxxed no doubt his family's address was revealed
[3:41:02.680 --> 3:41:08.920]  we know how this works by this point but then the police bragged about it west midlands police by
[3:41:08.920 --> 3:41:13.720]  the way which was part of the cover up of some of the grooming gang scandal in the uk not so
[3:41:13.720 --> 3:41:18.200]  concerned about that a mean tweet by a 12 year old though they were right on the case
[3:41:20.680 --> 3:41:25.320]  they tweeted we were alerted to a series of racist messages sent to a footballer today
[3:41:25.320 --> 3:41:30.040]  and after looking into them and conducting checks we have arrested a boy they were proud
[3:41:31.160 --> 3:41:35.720]  the 12 year old from solihull has been taken into custody thanks to everyone who raised it racism
[3:41:35.720 --> 3:41:45.000]  will not be tolerated so then people started to ask why there are 43 000 extremists most
[3:41:45.000 --> 3:41:50.440]  of them radical islamists on an mi5 terrorist watch list who are walking around free and
[3:41:50.440 --> 3:41:55.560]  try to commit terror attacks on a routine basis thankfully most of them get stopped some of them
[3:41:55.560 --> 3:42:01.480]  don't that's not important a 12 year old boy sending offensive messages he was caught within
[3:42:01.480 --> 3:42:07.640]  24 hours others chastise the same police force for failing to tackle far more serious crimes than
[3:42:07.640 --> 3:42:13.880]  a 12 year old boy being offensive and they point to the report about asian grooming gangs which
[3:42:13.880 --> 3:42:20.680]  was suppressed by this same police department somebody else said i wish you'd been so swift to
[3:42:20.680 --> 3:42:26.040]  act when i was defrauded to the sum of thousands of pounds i was told to go away again across the
[3:42:26.040 --> 3:42:30.680]  uk we're told on a routine basis oh if you get burgled sorry that's not important we're not
[3:42:30.680 --> 3:42:37.240]  even going to come out some kids there's something edgy on the internet now they crack down immediately
[3:42:38.760 --> 3:42:43.960]  somebody else said in response to the tweet i rang the police to report drug dealing taking
[3:42:43.960 --> 3:42:49.080]  place outside my house by students they said we're busy try the council so actual crimes
[3:42:50.680 --> 3:42:54.440]  not too enthusiastic about tackling them 12 year old boy sends a mean tweet
[3:42:54.440 --> 3:43:02.040]  and they have their crack detectives on the case and he's arrested within hours of course glane
[3:43:02.040 --> 3:43:07.960]  maxwell is up on trial with the federal court hearing today for sex trafficking alleged sex
[3:43:07.960 --> 3:43:14.120]  trafficking and some of the same leftists who maybe supported the murder of that woman who
[3:43:14.120 --> 3:43:21.720]  said white lives matter also supported glane maxwell as a feminist icon who could bring down
[3:43:21.720 --> 3:43:27.240]  trump yes this actually happened leftist celebrates glane maxwell as a feminist icon who could bring
[3:43:27.240 --> 3:43:35.560]  down trump this was hunter collin who lists his pronouns on his twitter bio no surprise there
[3:43:35.560 --> 3:43:41.240]  says he's a progressive says he's a democrat and he tweeted tomorrow could get real ugly
[3:43:41.240 --> 3:43:46.280]  glane maxwell has her day in court she could be the one that brings down trump and the mob
[3:43:46.280 --> 3:43:51.880]  unless it's the treason and the financials he then appeared to attempt to portray maxwell
[3:43:51.880 --> 3:43:58.120]  and accused sex trafficker of dozens of girls some of the miners as being some kind of feminist
[3:43:58.120 --> 3:44:07.240]  icon by remarking remember it was always going to be a woman others jumped in saying get it girl
[3:44:07.240 --> 3:44:13.080]  while another shared a feminist meme accompanied with the words we can do it of course they're not
[3:44:13.080 --> 3:44:19.480]  going to do it because as we know from the victims of jeffrey eppstein trump had nothing to do with
[3:44:19.480 --> 3:44:26.440]  it they tried to put up that fake rape charge before the 2016 election which came directly from
[3:44:26.440 --> 3:44:31.400]  a never trump that fell through the cracks because it was completely flimsy non-existent
[3:44:32.760 --> 3:44:37.400]  and as i point out in this article while donald trump was once a personal friend of jeffrey eppstein
[3:44:37.400 --> 3:44:44.760]  he banned the billionaire pedophile from visiting mar-a-lago shortly after eppstein's 2008 conviction
[3:44:45.320 --> 3:44:50.760]  meanwhile kevin spacey and the rest of them bill clinton are still hopping on the lily to express
[3:44:50.760 --> 3:44:56.440]  bill gates is still investing hundreds of thousands of dollars into jeffrey eppstein's projects
[3:44:57.720 --> 3:45:03.240]  whereas trump as soon as he found out barred banned eppstein from his florida residence
[3:45:03.240 --> 3:45:08.920]  and of course eppstein victim virginia roberts guffrey confirmed in unsealed court documents last
[3:45:08.920 --> 3:45:13.640]  year that she didn't witness trump involved with any of the girls and women groomed by eppstein
[3:45:13.640 --> 3:45:17.640]  she said it's true that he didn't partake in any sex with us but it's not true that he flirted with
[3:45:17.640 --> 3:45:22.840]  me donald trump never flirted with me but apparently delay maxwell is now a feminist
[3:45:22.840 --> 3:45:33.800]  icon that's gonna wrap it up war room next don't go away
