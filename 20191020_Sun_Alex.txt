[00:00.000 --> 00:04.740]  Gavin McInnis is back with his all-new online network, FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:04.740 --> 00:30.340]  Gavin McInnis, Joe Biggs, Milo Yiannopoulos, and Soph, all at FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:30.340 --> 00:49.140]  It's Sunday, October 20th, 2019.
[00:49.140 --> 00:53.220]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to be here for the next two hours.
[00:53.220 --> 00:54.220]  We are live.
[00:54.220 --> 00:55.220]  Okay.
[00:55.220 --> 01:00.180]  I say this at the beginning of almost every broadcast for the last five years.
[01:00.180 --> 01:01.700]  We're just getting more intense every day.
[01:01.700 --> 01:02.780]  There's more news.
[01:02.780 --> 01:05.220]  There's never a slow news day.
[01:05.220 --> 01:12.460]  There is civil war and mass riots and police gunning people down on the streets from Hong
[01:12.460 --> 01:22.940]  Kong to Spain in Catalonia, to Central and South America, to Africa, to the Middle East.
[01:22.940 --> 01:26.900]  Six warning signs that civil unrest is imminent is an article on Info Wars from yesterday.
[01:26.900 --> 01:28.380]  Well, here it is.
[01:28.380 --> 01:34.940]  Direct footage shows national Spanish police and brutal Catalonia protests, six outbreaks
[01:34.940 --> 01:38.980]  of mass violence across the world.
[01:38.980 --> 01:42.420]  We're getting to all of that and why that's being triggered.
[01:42.420 --> 01:44.220]  Then we're going to get into the huge news.
[01:44.220 --> 01:45.660]  I'm going to play a clip of this in a moment.
[01:45.660 --> 01:54.820]  Hillary caught on tape in a DNC group phone call, so she knows this is being recorded talking
[01:54.820 --> 02:01.740]  about how she lies and how the Republicans are going to be able to outlie the Democrats.
[02:01.740 --> 02:07.460]  So she's projecting onto Republicans what she is, just incredible.
[02:07.460 --> 02:12.140]  And then it ties into the huge stories on InfoWars.com and at naturalnews.com.
[02:12.140 --> 02:15.260]  We were separately already working on this in parallel.
[02:15.260 --> 02:18.660]  And then Mike called me yesterday and said he was working on a huge report.
[02:18.660 --> 02:30.580]  It is 18 pages long alert Antifa Puppetmasters engineer Patriot that's, quote, slaughter
[02:30.580 --> 02:34.020]  of leftists to spark violent uprising against conservatives.
[02:34.020 --> 02:36.020]  Here's our report.
[02:36.020 --> 02:41.100]  Soros Deep State backed Antifa publicly announced its plan to drive Trump from office.
[02:41.100 --> 02:45.940]  And we've seen the numbers of Antifa being 10, 15 times what we've seen other cities
[02:45.940 --> 02:50.540]  in Texas and in Ohio and in New York where we've had reporters putting us truly on the
[02:50.540 --> 02:51.540]  ground.
[02:51.540 --> 02:59.420]  And that ties into these documents from two years ago, Obama documents revealed plan for
[02:59.420 --> 03:03.980]  civil unrest and martial law in Baltimore back when Obama was in, but she got those documents
[03:03.980 --> 03:10.180]  so they're trying the same thing again, that is so huge.
[03:10.180 --> 03:15.140]  And you've got Hillary going around and campaigning for president only thing she hasn't done is
[03:15.140 --> 03:19.620]  announced that and Tulsi came out and exposed that and said, why don't you just go ahead
[03:19.620 --> 03:25.620]  and announce you're running, you know, it's only you and I really in the race and that
[03:25.620 --> 03:29.220]  your plan is to keep me out of the debates and keep me from raising money.
[03:29.220 --> 03:30.540]  And I agree with that.
[03:30.540 --> 03:37.580]  Hillary is obsessed with Tulsi and we're going to be going over all of that today.
[03:37.580 --> 03:39.860]  I mean, there is just so much.
[03:39.860 --> 03:46.380]  Meanwhile, the Duke, Queen Elizabeth, son is ensnared with Epstein.
[03:46.380 --> 03:48.580]  That's breaking.
[03:48.580 --> 03:53.380]  Trump's speech was incredible in Dallas and I was there for it.
[03:53.380 --> 03:56.380]  It's all coming up today, but let's, let's, let's play this clip.
[03:56.380 --> 04:01.260]  I'm going to play a longer clip coming up, but here's the article up on info wars.com.
[04:01.260 --> 04:03.660]  Hillary Clinton declares bankrupt DNC.
[04:03.660 --> 04:06.700]  We're going to be outgunned, outspent, out lied.
[04:06.700 --> 04:11.860]  That mark goes to the angle that she's pointing out that, that the DNC is a joke.
[04:11.860 --> 04:17.340]  Well, she had it that way, so only she has power or only she collects the money.
[04:17.340 --> 04:21.060]  But now she's saying, don't worry, I'm coming in to save you as we predicted she would do.
[04:21.060 --> 04:25.100]  But here she is saying that the Republicans are going to outlie them.
[04:25.100 --> 04:30.540]  Well, we know they lie out of hand, but the Republicans have lied some in the past, but
[04:30.540 --> 04:33.700]  the current crop with Trump, he's all about keeping his promises.
[04:33.700 --> 04:42.140]  That's why they constantly claim that Trump is a phony, but he's not a phony.
[04:42.140 --> 04:43.780]  Let's go ahead and go out to break with Hillary.
[04:43.780 --> 04:45.020]  Here it is.
[04:45.020 --> 04:50.300]  I think we'll be a little better off than we were back then, but we're going to be outgunned,
[04:50.300 --> 04:52.820]  outspent, out lied.
[04:52.820 --> 04:57.580]  I mean, we're going to have a lot of problems and the thing we have to do is.
[04:57.580 --> 04:59.580]  You're going to be out lied.
[04:59.580 --> 05:03.860]  They'll be right back on the other side of this live Sunday show.
[05:03.860 --> 05:04.860]  Please help us win the war.
[05:04.860 --> 05:05.860]  We're in this together.
[05:05.860 --> 05:10.980]  Please spread the live show links.
[05:10.980 --> 05:15.300]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers who enforce.
[05:15.300 --> 05:21.020]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of
[05:21.020 --> 05:25.700]  corporate tyranny has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S. worldwide.
[05:25.700 --> 05:31.300]  And President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty
[05:31.300 --> 05:32.780]  is amazing as well.
[05:32.780 --> 05:38.220]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that in some other areas,
[05:38.220 --> 05:43.020]  but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China.
[05:43.020 --> 05:47.260]  Trump's been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever, we really have to realize
[05:47.260 --> 05:52.620]  that we're being targeted because we are effective and the globalists are beginning
[05:52.620 --> 05:56.580]  to lose their war against humanity in a big way.
[05:56.580 --> 06:00.420]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them, but it's critical to not let
[06:00.420 --> 06:04.860]  ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[06:04.860 --> 06:06.780]  That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[06:06.780 --> 06:34.900]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[06:37.140 --> 06:48.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Sunday, October 20th, 2019, and the globalists are in complete
[06:48.620 --> 06:50.700]  crisis mode.
[06:50.700 --> 06:55.260]  President Trump is doing everything he can to restore sovereignty back to the United
[06:55.260 --> 06:59.580]  States, back to the federal government, the state governments, and we the people.
[06:59.580 --> 07:04.420]  And the criminals that have sold our nation out for the last 50 years are freaking out
[07:04.420 --> 07:08.700]  because every day he is exposing their criminal activity.
[07:08.700 --> 07:14.820]  And that's why they constantly keep branding Trump as the liar when he has kept his promises
[07:14.820 --> 07:22.300]  unlike any president in modern history that we've seen hands down.
[07:22.300 --> 07:27.100]  Let's go ahead and go to the president when he was in Dallas Thursday, laying out who
[07:27.100 --> 07:31.860]  the enemy of the American people really is.
[07:31.860 --> 07:37.180]  We're fighting a campaign against leftists, socialists, and globalists who want to return
[07:37.180 --> 07:44.500]  to reckless wars, open borders, rampant crime, and totally disastrous one-way trade deals
[07:44.500 --> 07:51.580]  – we're changing that one around very quickly.
[07:51.580 --> 07:57.020]  They believe America is the world's piggy bank and that your tax dollars should subsidize
[07:57.020 --> 08:03.380]  the economy, military, and defense of every other nation in the world but our own.
[08:03.380 --> 08:06.740]  It's not happening anymore.
[08:06.740 --> 08:12.700]  Our political opposition made its fortune selling out our nation and its citizens, and
[08:12.700 --> 08:14.620]  you know that's what's been happening.
[08:14.620 --> 08:19.180]  And that's why 2016 was so important.
[08:19.180 --> 08:26.580]  And that's why 2020, I can never say it's more important, but you know it's like the
[08:26.580 --> 08:30.980]  roots of a tree, you plant the baby tree, it's got to catch.
[08:30.980 --> 08:36.820]  Get that extra time, we'll have more tax cuts, we'll have even, I'll tell you what,
[08:36.820 --> 08:46.020]  we have rebuilt our military, what we've done has never been done before.
[08:46.020 --> 08:52.260]  The system is in panic mode because Trump is delivering, and the generals have been fighting
[08:52.260 --> 08:55.620]  him on pulling troops out of Afghanistan and out of Syria.
[08:55.620 --> 08:57.340]  And Trump said, that's it, it's not our problem.
[08:57.340 --> 09:01.660]  Obama went in there and destabilized it, we're stabilizing it and we're out of there.
[09:01.660 --> 09:05.620]  So Pelosi's run over to the Middle East to try to claim that it's all in a big crisis.
[09:05.620 --> 09:07.140]  It's always been in a crisis.
[09:07.140 --> 09:10.700]  We're going to get to that later.
[09:10.700 --> 09:15.940]  But I wanted to cover Bill Ma right now because notice he follows the tactic of saying Trump's
[09:15.940 --> 09:24.940]  stingy, Trump never does what he says he's going to do, Trump doesn't deliver.
[09:24.940 --> 09:29.020]  Think about that.
[09:29.020 --> 09:31.820]  But really, it's the Democratic Party that's been caught lying.
[09:31.820 --> 09:37.740]  They're the ones that can't defend their policies of selling the nation out.
[09:37.740 --> 09:41.580]  And so they've got to try to turn it around and make it all about racism and all this
[09:41.580 --> 09:43.860]  cultural division.
[09:43.860 --> 09:50.860]  But Hillary just got caught on tape stories up on infowars.com on a DNC high level phone
[09:50.860 --> 09:56.420]  call, a conference call saying we're going to be out lied by the Republicans, which
[09:56.420 --> 10:00.060]  is saying we lie, they're going to out lie us.
[10:00.060 --> 10:01.060]  Total projection.
[10:01.060 --> 10:05.100]  And that's how they get the leftist media and all of them to tell such incredible lies
[10:05.100 --> 10:10.980]  is, oh, the Republicans and Alex Jones are telling such big lies, we've got to out do
[10:10.980 --> 10:11.980]  them.
[10:11.980 --> 10:16.300]  Remember Jonathan Gruber who wrote Obamacare for Obama bragging on C-span to a big conference
[10:16.300 --> 10:20.100]  of college professors that I was hired because I could create the best lies.
[10:20.100 --> 10:23.380]  I could triple health care prices and make people think it was a good thing.
[10:23.380 --> 10:25.940]  Thank God they're so dumb and don't have memories.
[10:25.940 --> 10:28.860]  These people are in to lying.
[10:28.860 --> 10:31.100]  I'm into telling the truth.
[10:31.100 --> 10:34.860]  So I live in a good country on a good world and so do you and I treat you like I want
[10:34.860 --> 10:35.860]  to be treated.
[10:35.860 --> 10:36.860]  That's what made America great.
[10:36.860 --> 10:38.460]  I mean, we're ever perfect.
[10:38.460 --> 10:42.260]  But this thing of giving into corruption and acting like it's a good thing and all these
[10:42.260 --> 10:46.100]  articles in the New York Times, they had one last week saying, oh, we need to lie to get
[10:46.100 --> 10:47.100]  rid of Trump.
[10:47.100 --> 10:50.500]  It's a moral to lie.
[10:50.500 --> 10:55.060]  They're signaling to all the other journalists, don't be journalists anymore, completely give
[10:55.060 --> 10:58.660]  up on it and you'll be promoted for being a fraud.
[10:58.660 --> 11:02.580]  But really, all you're doing is destroying your industry.
[11:02.580 --> 11:03.580]  And so now you've already destroyed yourself.
[11:03.580 --> 11:07.180]  So now you want to shut down your competition, folks that tell the truth.
[11:07.180 --> 11:11.420]  So you misrepresent what we say and what we do so that you can remain on top.
[11:11.420 --> 11:12.420]  It's not going to work.
[11:12.420 --> 11:18.900]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip from Bill Maher.
[11:18.900 --> 11:20.260]  Serious person to serious person.
[11:20.260 --> 11:26.060]  I will bet you a million dollars right now that if you lose the 2020 election, I'm right
[11:26.060 --> 11:27.380]  and you won't leave.
[11:27.380 --> 11:28.940]  And what am I saying?
[11:28.940 --> 11:34.020]  This is Donald Trump we're talking about like he'd ever pony up even if he lost a bet.
[11:34.020 --> 11:36.220]  That would involve two things he's never done.
[11:36.220 --> 11:46.340]  Get defeated and pay a bill, so forget the bet.
[11:46.340 --> 11:47.780]  I got a better idea.
[11:47.780 --> 11:49.220]  How about this?
[11:49.220 --> 11:55.220]  Just take my check for one million dollars, my check for a million and I bet I could get
[11:55.220 --> 12:03.060]  another thousand people just from here to the beach, including Malibu of course, who
[12:03.060 --> 12:05.700]  would pay that much to see you resign.
[12:05.700 --> 12:09.220]  So Mr. President, it's really very simple.
[12:09.220 --> 12:13.340]  You love money, we hate you.
[12:13.340 --> 12:18.700]  Take the money.
[12:18.700 --> 12:24.460]  And he was responding to Trump video full videos up on infowars.com, this is an article
[12:24.460 --> 12:30.180]  on news wars, this is where it originates, where Trump says it's crazy.
[12:30.180 --> 12:33.620]  Bill Maher claims that I'm not going to leave office in 2024.
[12:33.620 --> 12:35.260]  That's nuts.
[12:35.260 --> 12:39.740]  I've always followed the rules, I've always followed what the courts say, I've got the
[12:39.740 --> 12:44.060]  most transparent office ever, it's not true I'm a dictator, I was elected.
[12:44.060 --> 12:46.980]  And then Maher turns it into oh, you're not going to leave in 2020.
[12:46.980 --> 12:50.500]  Well if there's massive election fraud, which the Democrats have been caught engaged in
[12:50.500 --> 12:57.180]  a year ago, three years ago, Trump better fight back against that and say no.
[12:57.180 --> 12:58.180]  We expect that.
[12:58.180 --> 13:02.980]  And of course, judicial watch and others have sued and gotten the actual numbers from all
[13:02.980 --> 13:03.980]  over the country.
[13:03.980 --> 13:07.380]  Millions are voting illegally in California alone.
[13:07.380 --> 13:09.420]  Of course we know that.
[13:09.420 --> 13:13.620]  That's what the Democrats do.
[13:13.620 --> 13:17.300]  Now here's Hillary, I'm going to play the full clip coming up, but this is so huge.
[13:17.300 --> 13:23.540]  Here's Hillary on a phone call with the DNC Friday and the GOP war room was able to get
[13:23.540 --> 13:30.260]  the code and get into the phone call and she's talking about how screwed up the DNC
[13:30.260 --> 13:35.740]  is, and she says they're going to outli us, she doesn't say we're going to counter their
[13:35.740 --> 13:41.780]  lives with truth, they're going to outli us, see we've got to lie better than they do.
[13:41.780 --> 13:44.340]  And we're going to be able to do it.
[13:44.340 --> 13:48.580]  So here's Hillary, the full phone calls on info wars.com, believe me, Hillary doesn't
[13:48.580 --> 13:53.300]  like you hearing this, but imagine what she says when it's not on a phone call to the
[13:53.300 --> 13:54.300]  DNC.
[13:54.300 --> 13:56.820]  Here it is.
[13:56.820 --> 14:00.180]  I think we'll be a little better off than we were back then.
[14:00.180 --> 14:04.660]  But we're going to be outgunned, outspent, out lied.
[14:04.660 --> 14:09.180]  I mean, we're going to have a lot of problems and the thing we have to do.
[14:09.180 --> 14:12.700]  So we'll tell you the thing they have to do when we come back.
[14:12.700 --> 14:14.660]  And then I'm going to get into the big news here.
[14:14.660 --> 14:16.940]  There's so much out of you told she's coming up yet.
[14:16.940 --> 14:22.500]  Mark Zuckerberg came out as you know on Thursday and he gave a speech at Georgetown University
[14:22.500 --> 14:24.500]  and I was so busy I didn't get into it.
[14:24.500 --> 14:27.540]  And he said, oh, we don't censor on the guardian of free speech.
[14:27.540 --> 14:29.020]  This isn't just hypocrisy or lies.
[14:29.020 --> 14:30.900]  It's very important.
[14:30.900 --> 14:36.260]  And I worked a bunch of hours today to create a report that we're going to premiere in the
[14:36.260 --> 14:41.180]  last segment of this hour that's got clips of his speech, Tucker Carlson taking him to
[14:41.180 --> 14:43.860]  the woodshed and my analysis of the documents.
[14:43.860 --> 14:44.860]  It's very important.
[14:44.860 --> 14:46.620]  We're going to cover it last segment of this hour.
[14:46.620 --> 14:51.860]  Millie Weaver is going to be joining us in the second hour to get into Antifa when she's
[14:51.860 --> 14:56.940]  on the ground in Ohio and in DC and in New York and in Florida and all the places she's
[14:56.940 --> 14:57.940]  been the last month.
[14:57.940 --> 15:02.740]  Antifa's numbers are not in the hundreds now in many areas where they were where there
[15:02.740 --> 15:03.740]  were dozens.
[15:03.740 --> 15:04.740]  There are hundreds where there were hundreds.
[15:04.740 --> 15:05.740]  There are thousands.
[15:05.740 --> 15:12.300]  And I saw that in Dallas 20 here, 500 here, 200 here, another 100 here.
[15:12.300 --> 15:15.060]  Their numbers are huge now compared to what they were.
[15:15.060 --> 15:16.660]  And they're a new type of Antifa.
[15:16.660 --> 15:18.140]  We're going to be getting to that.
[15:18.140 --> 15:21.460]  We know they're funded by the Democratic Party, by the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie
[15:21.460 --> 15:23.260]  Foundation, and by Soros.
[15:23.260 --> 15:25.780]  We have the internal documents.
[15:25.780 --> 15:31.100]  So I was working on an article yesterday for infores.com, Soros deep state backed Antifa
[15:31.100 --> 15:34.300]  publicly announces plan to drive Trump from office.
[15:34.300 --> 15:35.940]  They're just the cover for it.
[15:35.940 --> 15:42.980]  There's other groups behind this, just like Soros has funded million women marches to
[15:42.980 --> 15:46.500]  spout socialist and communist garbage that it's not for women.
[15:46.500 --> 15:51.060]  He's getting ready to spend the funding for violent groups, not just groups running around
[15:51.060 --> 15:52.060]  screaming and yelling.
[15:52.060 --> 15:56.900]  And there's a huge article went up on infores.com from naturalnews.com, alert Antifa public
[15:56.900 --> 16:02.780]  masters to engineer Patriot swatter of leftist to spark violent uprising as conservatives.
[16:02.780 --> 16:04.180]  This is critical.
[16:04.180 --> 16:05.180]  This is what they're planning.
[16:05.180 --> 16:10.260]  And we have statements and documents exclusively stay with us.
[16:10.260 --> 16:14.740]  My friends, I've seen a lot of Donald Trump just like you have.
[16:14.740 --> 16:20.700]  And my goodness, yesterday's press conference, when they came in on him with all their garbage,
[16:20.700 --> 16:25.380]  the foreign reporters, the U.S. reporters, these little political sellouts, these whores,
[16:25.380 --> 16:27.900]  he just tore them to bits.
[16:27.900 --> 16:31.700]  And it's one thing to hear it of your radio listeners, powerful, but if you see it, it's
[16:31.700 --> 16:37.100]  all at band.video, you've got the full press conference, we've got my boil down of how
[16:37.100 --> 16:38.100]  epic it is.
[16:38.100 --> 16:41.940]  It's all at band.video, and I just, you've got to share this with people because Trump
[16:41.940 --> 16:44.540]  was hitting on all 45 cylinders.
[16:44.540 --> 16:45.540]  This was amazing.
[16:45.540 --> 16:48.020]  And he turned the nitrous oxide on top of it.
[16:48.020 --> 16:52.500]  So Info Wars, America, Trump, all of us, incredible things are happening, and we're
[16:52.500 --> 16:57.700]  sharing the ideas that are going to defeat the tyrants at band.video.
[16:57.700 --> 17:01.540]  And I got to tell you, we've done great video work, we've done great films, we've done so
[17:01.540 --> 17:03.700]  much, but websites are not our thing.
[17:03.700 --> 17:04.700]  Well, now they are.

[17:12.500 --> 17:16.380]  I don't promote things unless I know they get big results.

[17:32.660 --> 17:36.220]  Yeah, we're not in Kansas anymore, as I like to say.

[20:14.260 --> 20:41.820]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:41.820 --> 20:45.660]  Joining us, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[20:45.660 --> 20:50.700]  Before I plunge into the news and analysis, as we enter segment three here today, I want
[20:50.700 --> 20:59.580]  to just be 100% clear, America was an open free society predominantly and powerful corporate
[20:59.580 --> 21:05.020]  combines came in after World War II when we dominated the planet and could have set up
[21:05.020 --> 21:11.060]  a world empire at that point and took over the United States to set up a corporate world
[21:11.060 --> 21:16.260]  empire, which then we pay for, but we get to blame for it.
[21:16.260 --> 21:19.300]  People believe it's the American empire, it's not.
[21:19.300 --> 21:24.300]  China is then set up to replace us and we fit the bill and then authoritarianism spreads
[21:24.300 --> 21:25.300]  worldwide.
[21:25.300 --> 21:31.020]  Now everyone sees that my hypothesis about the new world order is 100% that on because
[21:31.020 --> 21:35.100]  it wasn't a hypothesis, it wasn't a theory.
[21:35.100 --> 21:38.300]  It was in the Council on Foreign Relations documents.
[21:38.300 --> 21:42.260]  It was stated by the Club of Rome, it was pushed in hundreds and hundreds of books that
[21:42.260 --> 21:49.860]  I read written by globalists admitting their plan.
[21:49.860 --> 21:55.340]  So it's not a hypothesis that the Astro baseball team is based in Houston.
[21:55.340 --> 21:59.740]  It's not a hypothesis that Mao Zedong killed 80 plus million people.
[21:59.740 --> 22:01.740]  The Chinese government admits he did.
[22:01.740 --> 22:03.860]  They're proud of it.
[22:03.860 --> 22:07.900]  And it's not a hypothesis that there's a war on the family, the war on a pro human
[22:07.900 --> 22:08.900]  future.
[22:08.900 --> 22:12.780]  So I've studied who the globalist are, not just what their plan is, but who they are
[22:12.780 --> 22:19.220]  because their plan for a world government only gets them in control to then carry out
[22:19.220 --> 22:22.380]  the rest of the story.
[22:22.380 --> 22:25.620]  And you see that coming into view now they've almost got their world government complete.
[22:25.620 --> 22:32.780]  I'm going to talk about that at the start of the next hour.
[22:32.780 --> 22:36.500]  Extinction Rebellion last week and I meant to cover this and forgot so please print me
[22:36.500 --> 22:37.500]  the article.
[22:37.500 --> 22:42.980]  It was heavily funded by the Club of Rome, the UN, George Soros, came out and said our
[22:42.980 --> 22:48.340]  mission is to end heterosexuality, to end humans having children.
[22:48.340 --> 22:50.020]  You go, that sounds radical.
[22:50.020 --> 22:54.580]  No, that's the UN Global Plan.
[22:54.580 --> 22:57.780]  We're going to save the earth by getting rid of humans and that means we're going to force
[22:57.780 --> 22:59.100]  homosexuality.
[22:59.100 --> 23:02.260]  That was the director of it in a medium interview.
[23:02.260 --> 23:06.780]  You can make fun of the group, but they're funded in the entire seven continents to run
[23:06.780 --> 23:08.340]  around foaming at the mouth.
[23:08.340 --> 23:10.980]  That's coming up next hour.
[23:10.980 --> 23:15.020]  There it is, Extinction Rebellion co-founder says climate protest is about ending.
[23:15.020 --> 23:18.780]  The idea heterosexuality is normal.
[23:18.780 --> 23:23.460]  These people mean business and they hijack any movement they can for total control.
[23:23.460 --> 23:24.460]  That's coming up.
[23:24.460 --> 23:31.540]  But let's get into what's currently unfolding because our reporters, thanks to your support,
[23:31.540 --> 23:33.500]  are all over the country and all over the world.
[23:33.500 --> 23:38.220]  We've got reporters at almost every major Trump event and at these big DNC events to
[23:38.220 --> 23:43.100]  show how nice and friendly and diverse the Trump supporters are, how foaming at the mouth
[23:43.100 --> 23:45.180]  insane and evil the Democrats are.
[23:45.180 --> 23:46.180]  We're not cherry picking.
[23:46.180 --> 23:48.660]  They are a train wreck.
[23:48.660 --> 23:52.540]  So Will Johnson was up in Dallas, this is a short little clip, and all these people are
[23:52.540 --> 23:56.740]  calling Trump a gangster and saying he's lied about everything, like how he'd try to get
[23:56.740 --> 24:01.380]  us out of Syria and now he's done it or how he'd try to get the taxes cut and did it or
[24:01.380 --> 24:03.380]  how he'd try to control the border and he's doing it.
[24:03.380 --> 24:06.820]  I mean, he's trying how he'd try to boost the economy.
[24:06.820 --> 24:07.820]  He did it.
[24:07.820 --> 24:10.540]  How he'd stand up to China on one side of trade deals, how he'd get us out of the Trans
[24:10.540 --> 24:14.740]  Pacific partnership.
[24:14.740 --> 24:17.100]  He's really the president and that's why they're so upset.
[24:17.100 --> 24:19.100]  This video's up on infowars.com.
[24:19.100 --> 24:21.500]  The full video, here's just part of it.
[24:21.500 --> 24:23.700]  Rainwashed liberals think Trump's a gangster.
[24:23.700 --> 24:24.900]  You'll see why I'm going to play this in a moment.
[24:24.900 --> 24:25.900]  Here it is.
[24:25.900 --> 24:26.900]  Can you answer me a question?
[24:26.900 --> 24:27.900]  Why should Trump be impeached?
[24:27.900 --> 24:38.140]  Because he went to a foreign power and asked him to help him win the election.
[24:38.140 --> 24:39.140]  They did?
[24:39.140 --> 24:40.140]  He doesn't need the help.
[24:40.140 --> 24:41.140]  Why would he do that?
[24:41.140 --> 24:42.140]  He said he did it.
[24:42.140 --> 24:43.140]  He needs the help and he's done that.
[24:43.140 --> 24:44.140]  He only needs the help.
[24:44.140 --> 24:45.140]  He admitted it.
[24:45.140 --> 24:49.860]  Well, it reads like a classic organized crime, shakedown.
[24:49.860 --> 24:51.500]  I hear what you want.
[24:51.500 --> 24:53.980]  I have a favor I want from you, though.
[24:53.980 --> 24:57.580]  I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand lots of it.
[24:57.580 --> 25:01.900]  I'm taking over this territory, from now on it's mine.
[25:01.900 --> 25:05.340]  How would you like to wake up in the morning next to the head of it?
[25:05.340 --> 25:09.940]  Do you know asking a foreign power to help you is an impeachable offense?
[25:09.940 --> 25:13.540]  You know what I'm asking, and so I'm only going to say this a few more times, in a
[25:13.540 --> 25:14.780]  few more ways.
[25:14.780 --> 25:16.260]  And by the way, don't call me again.
[25:16.260 --> 25:18.380]  I'll call you when you've done what I asked.
[25:18.380 --> 25:22.420]  If you ain't out of town by tomorrow morning, you won't never leave it except in a pine
[25:22.420 --> 25:23.420]  box.
[25:23.420 --> 25:24.420]  He admitted it.
[25:24.420 --> 25:25.420]  He admitted it?
[25:25.420 --> 25:26.420]  Like it was okay.
[25:26.420 --> 25:28.820]  Exactly, how did he say it?
[25:28.820 --> 25:34.420]  He said, yes, I made that telephone call to the president of Ukraine.
[25:34.420 --> 25:36.900]  So what was his exact words?
[25:36.900 --> 25:41.460]  He said, look, I want you to look into Joe Biden and help me with the 2020 election.
[25:41.460 --> 25:45.500]  And gangsters don't talk straight, they talk atrocious, and he does.
[25:45.500 --> 25:47.500]  I'm going to make him an awfully kind of a few.
[25:47.500 --> 25:52.220]  If a Democrat did what Donald Trump has done, the Republicans would be all over it.
[25:52.220 --> 25:53.220]  You're not getting the billion.
[25:53.220 --> 25:54.220]  I'm going to be leaving here.
[25:54.220 --> 25:55.220]  I think it was what, six hours?
[25:55.220 --> 25:57.060]  I looked, I said, I'm leaving in six hours.
[25:57.060 --> 26:00.380]  If the prosecutor's not fired, you're not getting the money.
[26:00.380 --> 26:02.100]  Oh, son of a bitch.
[26:02.100 --> 26:03.740]  Got fired.
[26:03.740 --> 26:07.780]  Get your hate out of my state!
[26:07.780 --> 26:08.780]  Get your hate out of my state!
[26:08.780 --> 26:09.780]  Get your hate out of my state!
[26:09.780 --> 26:10.780]  Get your hate out of my state!
[26:10.780 --> 26:11.780]  Get your hate out of my state!
[26:11.780 --> 26:16.580]  I see these incredible reports our reporters put out just multiple times a day.
[26:16.580 --> 26:18.780]  I'm just so blessed to have InfoWars.
[26:18.780 --> 26:21.020]  So blessed to have built this with your help.
[26:21.020 --> 26:22.620]  Please spread the word about all these videos.
[26:22.620 --> 26:24.380]  People deserve and need to see this.
[26:24.380 --> 26:29.380]  This is the medicine America and the world needs to counter the globalist poison.
[26:29.380 --> 26:30.380]  But there's so many of these videos.
[26:30.380 --> 26:35.300]  I'm not going to play all of it, but Senator Rand Paul was out in California having a quiet
[26:35.300 --> 26:36.300]  lunch.
[26:36.300 --> 26:37.700]  He's talking about gangsters.
[26:37.700 --> 26:40.740]  Well, here come the Democrats to get in his face.
[26:40.740 --> 26:41.740]  Here it is.
[26:41.740 --> 26:42.740]  Oh, I'm not being rude.
[26:42.740 --> 26:43.740]  He's a public official.
[26:43.740 --> 26:44.740]  I have the right to speak to him.
[26:44.740 --> 26:45.740]  You're flipping him off.
[26:45.740 --> 26:54.780]  You just ran into two people from New York kiddo and we're not putting up with your
[26:54.780 --> 26:55.780]  Republican bull.
[26:55.780 --> 27:01.140]  What I'm saying is that while you're possibly probably, I mean, it just goes on.
[27:01.140 --> 27:05.340]  I guess it wasn't enough to break six of his ribs and puncture his lung or it wasn't
[27:05.340 --> 27:06.340]  enough.
[27:06.340 --> 27:07.340]  His colleagues got shot.
[27:07.340 --> 27:10.060]  I mean, this is the gangster paradise where the Democrat leaders say go out and attack
[27:10.060 --> 27:11.060]  people.
[27:11.060 --> 27:12.580]  And now they're setting up real violence.
[27:12.580 --> 27:15.980]  We'll tell you about that next segment, the documents that are breaking right now that
[27:15.980 --> 27:19.100]  are so important on infowars.com beyond paramount emergency.
[27:19.100 --> 27:21.940]  We could stop them if the public learns about this.
[27:21.940 --> 27:27.180]  But here's Hillary again, the full behind the scenes recordings on infowars.com.
[27:27.180 --> 27:30.940]  Hillary Clinton says, we're going to be outgunned, outspent, outlawed.
[27:30.940 --> 27:35.900]  That saying we've got to lie more like ABC News cropping footage of a machine gun shootout
[27:35.900 --> 27:40.660]  deal in Kentucky and saying that was, you know, Trump letting people be blown up or
[27:40.660 --> 27:48.180]  what you just heard was Schiff reading a fake transcript in the Judiciary Committee that
[27:48.180 --> 27:51.100]  he chairs or the Intelligence Committee.
[27:51.100 --> 27:54.020]  I mean, that's the level of this line.
[27:54.020 --> 27:57.420]  And that's why it's so dangerous because they've upped the ante where, oh, we got caught
[27:57.420 --> 27:58.420]  in lies.
[27:58.420 --> 28:03.260]  Well, let's just create a whole fabric of lies, a whole universe of lies, a whole system
[28:03.260 --> 28:04.260]  of lies.
[28:04.260 --> 28:07.660]  But there's so many lies, no one even knows which end is up.
[28:07.660 --> 28:10.340]  The truth is though, it's not the general public drinking the Kool-Aid.
[28:10.340 --> 28:13.220]  There's supporters that believe the lies and they've now gone crazy.
[28:13.220 --> 28:17.420]  We're going to go to break with Hillary and we're going to come back and get into their
[28:17.420 --> 28:18.900]  ace in the hole.
[28:18.900 --> 28:21.500]  Here it is.
[28:21.500 --> 28:26.260]  And you know, as well as anybody, that you get the nomination when you're a Democrat
[28:26.260 --> 28:29.460]  and then you basically have to get a game plan for the general election.
[28:29.460 --> 28:36.460]  When I became the nominee, I inherited a bankrupt organization and Donald Trump inherited a well
[28:36.460 --> 28:39.900]  funded, well-prepared organization.
[28:39.900 --> 28:45.820]  The day he got the nomination, having done nothing for Republicans, his entire campaign,
[28:45.820 --> 28:51.980]  was a day that there already were, you know, like 21 offices in Florida.
[28:51.980 --> 28:53.140]  I had to do all of that.
[28:53.140 --> 28:54.140]  There was nothing.
[28:54.140 --> 28:55.140]  I had nothing.
[28:55.140 --> 28:56.140]  A lot of stack of garbage.
[28:56.140 --> 29:01.260]  From my perspective, I think we'll be a little better off than we were back then, but we're
[29:01.260 --> 29:05.620]  going to be outgunned, outspent, out lied.
[29:05.620 --> 29:10.340]  I mean, we're going to have a lot of problems.
[29:10.340 --> 29:13.900]  Now is the critical time to keep him full wars on the air.
[29:13.900 --> 29:17.260]  Everything we've warned of is now being exposed and it's out in the open.
[29:17.260 --> 29:18.820]  I want to be clear.
[29:18.820 --> 29:20.260]  It's not coming true.
[29:20.260 --> 29:21.900]  It was already true.
[29:21.900 --> 29:23.500]  I didn't predict all this.
[29:23.500 --> 29:25.260]  It was already going on.
[29:25.260 --> 29:29.340]  Now the globalists are making their move with the Chai comms, so it's naked.
[29:29.340 --> 29:30.340]  It's brazen.
[29:30.340 --> 29:33.100]  This is the point when the enemy emerges.
[29:33.100 --> 29:37.140]  Just like before World War II, the Poles kept warning that Nazi Germany was going to attack
[29:37.140 --> 29:38.140]  them.
[29:38.140 --> 29:42.380]  Nobody believed them as they saw the troops massing until it finally happened.
[29:42.380 --> 29:46.660]  We're at that same point and we're all Paul Revere's who need to be out there warning
[29:46.660 --> 29:50.660]  everyone about what's unfolding because this is the critical fight.
[29:50.660 --> 29:56.500]  And thank God America and the world is waking up at the 11th hour, 58 minutes, but will
[29:56.500 --> 29:58.580]  it be too little too late?
[29:58.580 --> 29:59.580]  That's up to you.
[29:59.580 --> 30:00.580]  This battle's hot.
[30:00.580 --> 30:01.580]  It's real.
[30:01.580 --> 30:06.740]  Spread the word and support M4 Wars Today at m4store.com, but whatever you do, spread
[30:06.740 --> 30:21.900]  the word about the live transmission.
[30:21.900 --> 30:26.380]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone.
[30:26.380 --> 30:29.740]  Simply go to band.video with your Safari browser.
[30:29.740 --> 30:32.980]  Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen.
[30:32.980 --> 30:36.460]  When the menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen.
[30:36.460 --> 30:38.580]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[30:38.580 --> 30:40.820]  I suggest band.video.
[30:40.820 --> 30:45.420]  You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried
[30:45.420 --> 30:46.420]  to stop it.
[30:46.420 --> 30:49.820]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override
[30:49.820 --> 30:54.740]  them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[30:54.740 --> 30:58.780]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below
[30:58.780 --> 31:01.740]  on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.

[31:10.740 --> 31:14.100]  I knew it would be hard to top the last big sale we had.
[31:14.100 --> 31:19.140]  Black Friday comes early, but we've successfully been able to do it.

[33:13.780 --> 33:36.860]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:36.860 --> 33:46.860]  It's Happys, it's Happys, but my hand was made strong by the end of the almighty.
[33:46.860 --> 34:02.260]  We forward in this generation, triumph and plea, won't you help to sing these songs of
[34:02.260 --> 34:16.420]  freedom, because all I ever have are redemption songs.
[34:16.420 --> 34:20.100]  You know, I've got so many clips and so many news items and things I need to get to that
[34:20.100 --> 34:24.340]  all tie together.
[34:24.340 --> 34:29.020]  But the mental slavery is really where it all starts.
[34:29.020 --> 34:31.740]  People have to understand the globalist agenda.
[34:31.740 --> 34:33.580]  They have to understand the big picture.
[34:33.580 --> 34:36.260]  They have to understand who the globalist are.
[34:36.260 --> 34:40.260]  And then if people understand that, their system will be defeated very quickly.
[34:40.260 --> 34:45.660]  They are very nasty anti-human who are tired of having to have revolutions to take over
[34:45.660 --> 34:47.580]  that then people defeat.
[34:47.580 --> 34:55.860]  So they want to change how humans operate and make a servile and programmable so that
[34:55.860 --> 35:01.620]  there is a final revolution that can never be escaped from.
[35:01.620 --> 35:03.780]  There's a revolution against our humanity.
[35:03.780 --> 35:08.020]  It's a post human world and I'm going to cover that in the latest chapters in that start
[35:08.020 --> 35:11.820]  of the next hour and then Millie Weaver joins us.
[35:11.820 --> 35:19.780]  I did a lot of research for this, a lot of research and I wrote several articles, co-wrote
[35:19.780 --> 35:25.020]  them with one of the writers this weekend.
[35:25.020 --> 35:33.100]  And then right before I got on air, about 30 minutes before, Mike Adams published an
[35:33.100 --> 35:38.580]  article that parallels ours but is even more detailed and Mike's a smart engineer.
[35:38.580 --> 35:41.860]  And I concur with his analysis 100%.
[35:41.860 --> 35:50.340]  And I sped read this before the show and it made my brain explode because it's so accurate,
[35:50.340 --> 35:52.580]  so on target and so important.
[35:52.580 --> 35:56.340]  I mean, if somebody was going to give a speech on a subject this big, they could take a month
[35:56.340 --> 35:58.540]  to get ready.
[35:58.540 --> 36:03.140]  That's what I'm saying is I just am not even ready to cover this properly.
[36:03.140 --> 36:08.140]  It's so big, it's so important, there's no way I can just halfway get up here and talk
[36:08.140 --> 36:10.320]  about this.
[36:10.320 --> 36:12.940]  Every paragraph had links to it.
[36:12.940 --> 36:15.140]  I followed many of them.
[36:15.140 --> 36:17.740]  I understood and knew most of what I was already reading.
[36:17.740 --> 36:22.620]  And I saw some of the new statements, some of the new documents and it made my head explode
[36:22.620 --> 36:29.420]  because then I remembered Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters and Phil Mudd and others again
[36:29.420 --> 36:33.420]  the last two weeks saying they're going to kill the president, they're going to imprison
[36:33.420 --> 36:42.060]  him, they're going to target his supporters, they want mass arrest, we're all traitors.
[36:42.060 --> 36:46.340]  They're normalizing martial law to remove the president.
[36:46.340 --> 36:52.200]  They're normalizing a climate with their supporters on CNN, MSNBC and New York Times
[36:52.200 --> 36:58.220]  writers and readers, that when they start arresting people and start grabbing people
[36:58.220 --> 37:01.620]  and start killing people, that it's normal and legitimate.
[37:01.620 --> 37:07.740]  They're preparing the battle space while censoring millions and millions of accounts
[37:07.740 --> 37:13.500]  every day, new ones, of just housewives and regular people and school teachers and auto
[37:13.500 --> 37:19.220]  mechanics who stand up and say that they support President Trump or they love America.
[37:19.220 --> 37:29.660]  It's a very, very dangerous position and I was already intending to come in here today
[37:29.660 --> 37:35.420]  and report on this and then I called my cadams yesterday and I said, hey, I'm working on
[37:35.420 --> 37:36.420]  this.
[37:36.420 --> 37:41.500]  He goes, well, I'm working on that as well as you know, we're on the same page like we're
[37:41.500 --> 37:45.460]  looking on an airplane window, you fly by the Statue of Liberty, there it is.
[37:45.460 --> 37:50.620]  It's not that we're even having it synced up, it's what's there.
[37:50.620 --> 37:57.180]  It's like the background is blue today if you're a TV viewer.
[37:57.180 --> 38:04.220]  My shirt is light blue, my jacket is brown.
[38:04.220 --> 38:16.140]  It's prima facie, that's in the Latin on its face or the face of it.
[38:16.140 --> 38:21.900]  And we're just sitting here waiting for this to happen, I'm going to explain something.
[38:21.900 --> 38:29.700]  And you know it was staged by a bunch of things, but by stage real people died.
[38:29.700 --> 38:34.780]  The crisis actor thing is other people's victory and the Democrats have big sites where you
[38:34.780 --> 38:40.020]  can go rena-mab, that's where the term astroturf comes from, that's been around 30 years.
[38:40.020 --> 38:44.820]  You go to a protest, the UN, you'll see the truck there handing out the so-called handmade
[38:44.820 --> 38:49.220]  signs that look like they're handmade and when you look, they're printed, but they're
[38:49.220 --> 38:52.780]  printed to make it look like they were hand drawn and different, hundreds of different
[38:52.780 --> 38:53.780]  designs.
[38:53.780 --> 38:58.420]  I videotaped that, I caught them doing that 20 years ago in New York and did a report on
[38:58.420 --> 38:59.420]  it.
[38:59.420 --> 39:05.180]  It was an astroturf and you can hire up to a thousand people, it's the biggest ones
[39:05.180 --> 39:11.780]  I've seen, but they're all left as groups and you can go hire a crowd, but I'm not saying
[39:11.780 --> 39:17.940]  that's what this is, these are real people getting shot.
[39:17.940 --> 39:22.660]  But the individuals were both Antifa, both into the occult, both devil worshipers in
[39:22.660 --> 39:26.980]  Ohio and in Texas that went out on the same day and shot all these people and then it's
[39:26.980 --> 39:30.380]  blamed on gun owners.
[39:30.380 --> 39:35.300]  And Mike Adams in his big 18-page article lays out where who funds Antifa, the background
[39:35.300 --> 39:40.020]  of it and documents that have come out in court and the news where Alexander Soros is
[39:40.020 --> 39:48.780]  funding groups in, quote, attempts to cause general uprisings and rioting.
[39:48.780 --> 39:54.860]  You can read the documents on newswars.com and naturalnews.com.
[39:54.860 --> 39:58.980]  If you share it from inforwars.com on Facebook or Twitter, they'll block it, but you can
[39:58.980 --> 40:02.580]  still share naturalnews.com, it's somewhat good and you can share newswars.com really
[40:02.580 --> 40:07.020]  good, you can share Bandot video, hasn't been blackballed yet either, you can share the
[40:07.020 --> 40:08.740]  videos and articles from there.
[40:08.740 --> 40:13.580]  But whatever you do, share them by hand, share them by word of mouth because this is a big,
[40:13.580 --> 40:14.580]  big deal.
[40:14.580 --> 40:21.420]  Antifa puppet masters to engineer patriots slaughter, they're going to blame patriots,
[40:21.420 --> 40:27.340]  and quotes of leftists to spark violent uprising against conservatives.
[40:27.340 --> 40:30.540]  And they're announcing they're going to drive Trump from office and they're going to announce
[40:30.540 --> 40:40.940]  all this violence, but the media, when these events take place, are going to blame yours
[40:40.940 --> 40:46.620]  truly and talk radio and general communications where anybody outside of big tech is allowed
[40:46.620 --> 40:51.100]  to talk to each other because they want to be able to have their official story out when
[40:51.100 --> 40:56.340]  they kill President Trump or when they incapacitate President Trump.
[40:56.340 --> 40:59.660]  They want to put out their official story and have you stand down and have you put up
[40:59.660 --> 41:01.380]  with it and have you go along with it.
[41:01.380 --> 41:05.540]  And if right before they kill Trump or take Trump out, somebody goes into a big crowd
[41:05.540 --> 41:10.420]  of Antifa like they tried to do in Charlottesville by having the police stand down and then Soros
[41:10.420 --> 41:11.900]  funded both sides.
[41:11.900 --> 41:15.700]  Most of the white supremacist leaders were funded by the left, that's even come out.
[41:15.700 --> 41:22.580]  The woman really got killed, probably a heart attack, but the point is all of this is going
[41:22.580 --> 41:30.540]  on and they want to kick off a real Charlottesville and the numbers are increasing so they can
[41:30.540 --> 41:34.540]  then say, look, the right wing has hurt innocent people.
[41:34.540 --> 41:39.340]  We've got to fully silence them and it's Trump's fault and he's helped attack the media and
[41:39.340 --> 41:40.340]  it's his fault.
[41:40.340 --> 41:43.660]  So now he's going to be driven from office and they've got full page ads again in the
[41:43.660 --> 41:48.540]  New York Times saying drive Trump and pinch from office this November.
[41:48.540 --> 41:55.060]  Don't wait until 2020 and then Pelosi says by Thanksgiving is her timetable.
[41:55.060 --> 41:57.980]  They want Trump driven from office by the end of the year.
[41:57.980 --> 42:01.540]  They want to have the House vote for the trial in the Senate.
[42:01.540 --> 42:02.540]  That's impeachment.
[42:02.540 --> 42:08.340]  They want to indict him in the House by Thanksgiving and they want him gone by Christmas.
[42:08.340 --> 42:11.540]  Mitch McConnell's internal documents came out from last week, met with Republicans
[42:11.540 --> 42:17.080]  and said we believe they're really going to do it, prepare for the trial in the Senate
[42:17.080 --> 42:18.580]  before Christmas.
[42:18.580 --> 42:24.820]  Now, Trump's up there looking confident, being nice, talking about globalism and communism
[42:24.820 --> 42:26.540]  and socialism being the enemy of America.
[42:26.540 --> 42:27.540]  That's wonderful.
[42:27.540 --> 42:29.540]  It's all true.
[42:29.540 --> 42:35.420]  But Hillary is waiting in the wings to remove Trump and then run against whoever the Republicans
[42:35.420 --> 42:43.580]  put up and that's why she's only scared of Tulsi, Gabbard, because she really pulls much
[42:43.580 --> 42:46.980]  higher in real polls against Hillary and that's why they're trying to block her and
[42:46.980 --> 42:50.060]  that's why Tulsi's come out and said it's really a two-way race between the two of
[42:50.060 --> 42:51.060]  us.
[42:51.060 --> 42:54.900]  We're going to play those clips coming up, but first, to end this first hour, second
[42:54.900 --> 43:00.700]  hour's coming up, I'm going to really expose what Mark Zuckerberg's up to and why it's
[43:00.700 --> 43:06.060]  so important to realize who the real players are behind this and the unified fraud because
[43:06.060 --> 43:10.580]  they need the citizenship in place to take Trump out.
[43:10.580 --> 43:15.260]  Communist China quietly bought up Hollywood more than a decade ago and they've been approving
[43:15.260 --> 43:20.660]  almost all the scripts that you see on television or in the movies for many years.
[43:20.660 --> 43:25.100]  And now they own our debt, now they own the Democratic Party, now they've merged Silicon
[43:25.100 --> 43:28.740]  Valley to censor patriots off the air.
[43:28.740 --> 43:32.180]  Washington Post comes out and says they hope that Gigi Ping, the dictator of China, will
[43:32.180 --> 43:34.060]  quote, destroy Trump.
[43:34.060 --> 43:35.060]  That's a headline.
[43:35.060 --> 43:39.220]  So, Info Wars has been the Paul Revere of this operation.
[43:39.220 --> 43:43.700]  We have blown the whistle continuously and have been proven right and that's why it's
[43:43.700 --> 43:48.060]  more important than ever that we override Silicon Valley and their Chai Kong masters
[43:48.060 --> 43:53.260]  by word of mouth and spread the word about Info Wars and check out infowarstore.com.
[43:53.260 --> 43:57.300]  That's where the arsenal of our republic is being funded, that's where the tip of the
[43:57.300 --> 44:04.300]  spear is continually being forged is infowarstore.com.
[44:04.300 --> 44:12.860]  Silicon Valley thinks you're the dumb jellyfish.
[44:12.860 --> 44:14.780]  They think the West is dead.
[44:14.780 --> 44:17.740]  They think if they censor nationalist and patriots off the internet, you'll just forget
[44:17.740 --> 44:18.740]  about us.
[44:18.740 --> 44:22.020]  And then they'll be the only information out there, well, so far that's not been working
[44:22.020 --> 44:23.020]  too well for them.
[44:23.020 --> 44:27.700]  They think you're spreading the word steadfastly that the resistance to globalism is alive and
[44:27.700 --> 44:32.820]  well at band.video and now we've added a lot of new functions and a lot of new hosts and

[45:08.700 --> 45:09.700]  Band.video.

[45:14.940 --> 45:19.420]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename
[45:19.420 --> 45:20.420]  it.
[45:20.420 --> 45:21.980]  The secret 12 is ultra 12.
[45:21.980 --> 45:23.940]  It's twice as strong as secret 12.

[45:39.780 --> 45:40.780]  and on.

[47:13.780 --> 47:20.780]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:20.780 --> 47:29.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's a big article up on infowars.com.
[47:29.780 --> 47:34.780]  Watch Tucker Carlson issue a warning to Mark Zuckerberg.
[47:34.780 --> 47:37.780]  It's such an important report.
[47:37.780 --> 47:39.780]  It's on infowars.com.
[47:39.780 --> 47:41.780]  This is your mission.
[47:41.780 --> 47:44.780]  Let's spread this video.
[47:44.780 --> 47:49.780]  He's 35 years old, worth close to $100 billion.
[47:49.780 --> 47:55.280]  He founded and runs the largest and most powerful internet company in the world with close to
[47:55.280 --> 47:56.780]  three billion users.
[47:56.780 --> 48:03.980]  His name is Mark Zuckerberg and he's standing on a stage proclaiming his defense of free
[48:03.980 --> 48:07.620]  speech and the first amendment at Georgetown University.
[48:07.620 --> 48:14.380]  I'm here today because I believe that we must continue to stand for free expression.
[48:14.380 --> 48:17.620]  Free speech is for everybody, even the crazies.
[48:17.620 --> 48:19.860]  That's the very definition of free speech.
[48:19.860 --> 48:22.220]  In a free country, everyone can be heard.
[48:22.220 --> 48:26.500]  In totalitarian societies, only the powerful can be heard.
[48:26.500 --> 48:30.780]  The most repressive societies have always restricted speech the most and when people
[48:30.780 --> 48:35.820]  are finally able to speak, they often use their voice to call for change and I understand
[48:35.820 --> 48:42.220]  the concerns that people have about how tech platforms have centralized power, but even
[48:42.220 --> 48:47.500]  American tradition recognizes that some speech infringes on other people's rights, inevitably
[48:47.500 --> 48:52.300]  some people are going to use their voice to try to organize violence, to try to undermine
[48:52.300 --> 48:58.580]  elections, to hurt others, and we have a responsibility to address these risks because when you're
[48:58.580 --> 49:04.140]  serving billions of people, even if a very small percent of them cause harm, that can
[49:04.140 --> 49:06.340]  still be a lot of harm.
[49:06.340 --> 49:12.540]  Apple, Facebook, Spotify, Vimeo, YouTube, Twitter, all of them, polled or froze Jones'
[49:12.540 --> 49:17.500]  accounts on the grounds that his views are too dangerous to be heard publicly.
[49:17.500 --> 49:21.700]  The left, which seeks to crush anything it can't control, applauded the news.
[49:21.700 --> 49:24.860]  I believe that we have two responsibilities.
[49:24.860 --> 49:31.940]  To remove content when it can cause real danger as effectively as we can and to fight to uphold
[49:31.940 --> 49:37.940]  as wide of a definition of freedom of expression as possible and to not allow the definition
[49:37.940 --> 49:43.580]  of what is considered dangerous to expand beyond what is absolutely necessary.
[49:43.580 --> 49:45.740]  And that's what I'm committed to.
[49:45.740 --> 49:47.340]  How dangerous is info wars?
[49:47.340 --> 49:51.580]  Well, Facebook believes it's so dangerous that you can be banned from using the platform,
[49:51.580 --> 49:58.500]  Facebook, just for sharing its content unless you simultaneously denounce it, but that penetrates
[49:58.500 --> 49:59.500]  for just one moment.
[49:59.500 --> 50:03.900]  Just for a second, Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions.
[50:03.900 --> 50:09.580]  He's prescribing which political opinions you're allowed to have, which conversations
[50:09.580 --> 50:12.380]  all of us in this country can have about America.
[50:12.380 --> 50:15.460]  Keep in mind that nobody voted for Mark Zuckerberg.
[50:15.460 --> 50:17.020]  He's 34 years old.
[50:17.020 --> 50:19.540]  He's completely cut off from reality.
[50:19.540 --> 50:25.300]  He's worth $72 billion, and yet he can single handedly make our First Amendment irrelevant
[50:25.300 --> 50:26.780]  after 250 years.
[50:26.780 --> 50:32.180]  Now, I know many people disagree with this, but in general, I don't think it's right
[50:32.180 --> 50:36.780]  for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy.
[50:36.780 --> 50:42.700]  So as a principal in a democracy, I believe that people should decide what is credible,
[50:42.700 --> 50:44.180]  not tech companies.
[50:44.180 --> 50:47.260]  Now, of course, there are exceptions.
[50:47.260 --> 50:51.420]  And even for politicians, we're not going to allow content that incites violence or
[50:51.420 --> 50:52.620]  risks imminent harm.
[50:52.620 --> 50:55.020]  And of course, we don't allow voter suppression.
[50:55.020 --> 50:56.940]  Our voting is voice.
[50:56.940 --> 51:00.460]  A lot of our political debate takes place on social media platforms.
[51:00.460 --> 51:04.300]  So if they clamp down on one side of the debate, why wouldn't that influence an election's
[51:04.300 --> 51:05.300]  outcome?
[51:05.300 --> 51:09.500]  Democracy depends on the idea that we hold each other's right to express ourselves and
[51:09.500 --> 51:13.420]  be heard above our desire to always get the outcomes that we want.
[51:13.420 --> 51:15.820]  What is not really about Alex Jones, is it?
[51:15.820 --> 51:20.940]  It's about the idea that companies can make it impossible for your voice to be heard.
[51:20.940 --> 51:22.900]  Is that a precedent we should be comfortable with?
[51:22.900 --> 51:28.660]  Because while we may disagree on exactly where to draw the line on specific issues, we at
[51:28.660 --> 51:31.460]  least can disagree.
[51:31.460 --> 51:34.060]  That's what free expression is.
[51:34.060 --> 51:35.380]  People know what's true.
[51:35.380 --> 51:36.620]  They can smell it.
[51:36.620 --> 51:38.580]  You can't stop them from knowing that.
[51:38.580 --> 51:40.220]  You can't control their minds.
[51:40.220 --> 51:44.660]  You can only humiliate yourself and undermine your own authority by trying.
[51:44.660 --> 51:47.260]  Our childish billionaire overlords may be geniuses.
[51:47.260 --> 51:49.980]  They say they are, but they don't understand that.
[51:49.980 --> 51:55.580]  One day soon they will learn, and that is a comforting thought at a time like this.
[51:55.580 --> 51:58.900]  Why is Zuckerberg telling a lie this transparent?
[51:58.900 --> 52:04.780]  Well, on the surface, he's just repeating what the CEO of YouTube said in late August
[52:04.780 --> 52:09.980]  that they never censor and that YouTube and Google are totally open for everyone to say
[52:09.980 --> 52:14.300]  and do whatever they want as long as it isn't illegal.
[52:14.300 --> 52:18.060]  M4Wars tested that and relaunched a YouTube channel.
[52:18.060 --> 52:21.140]  It was banned within four hours.
[52:21.140 --> 52:28.700]  And right out of 1984, the YouTube CEO said, we are for free speech, just not Alex Joneses.
[52:28.700 --> 52:35.260]  Zuckerberg is simply imitating successful deception tactics deployed by Google and Apple
[52:35.260 --> 52:37.180]  against the Western world.
[52:37.180 --> 52:43.020]  Big Tech's real agenda is global domination, not just total surveillance of all information,
[52:43.020 --> 52:46.220]  but control of all information.
[52:46.220 --> 52:52.300]  Using Orwellian alchemy, Zuckerberg transforms himself from an enemy of free speech to its
[52:52.300 --> 52:54.360]  chief guardian.
[52:54.360 --> 52:57.940]  He will decide what is speech and what isn't.
[52:57.940 --> 52:58.940]  He will decide.
[52:58.940 --> 53:07.820]  And if you violate those rules, the AI is closely watching and will punish you.
[53:07.820 --> 53:13.380]  Authoritarian nations, authoritarian countries, authoritarian individuals are all in a race
[53:13.380 --> 53:17.460]  for hegemonic information control on this planet.
[53:17.460 --> 53:22.060]  And Communist China's attempt to flex its muscles by fully controlling Hollywood and
[53:22.060 --> 53:25.860]  the NBA has now caused a massive backlash.
[53:25.860 --> 53:30.620]  So Zuckerberg and others want to get out ahead of that so that they don't get connected
[53:30.620 --> 53:37.540]  to it and then Congress stays asleep and never does anything while they quietly take over
[53:37.540 --> 53:43.460]  the planet and destroy all of our basic liberties and freedoms that are the true protections
[53:43.460 --> 53:49.660]  on civilization and are the systems and societies that created an atmosphere of openness and
[53:49.660 --> 53:57.100]  freedom that allowed institutions like Google, Apple and Twitter to grow up.
[53:57.100 --> 54:02.540]  The truth is Big Tech has been surveilling us, Big Tech has been consolidating the economy,
[54:02.540 --> 54:05.700]  Big Tech has been censoring us for a long time.
[54:05.700 --> 54:10.740]  And the systems that they've developed are antithetical to free societies.
[54:10.740 --> 54:14.100]  They know that the people value their basic freedoms.
[54:14.100 --> 54:18.820]  They know that basic freedoms are what make populist movements strong.
[54:18.820 --> 54:25.980]  But that basic freedom stands in the way of global corporate dominance and the CEOs that
[54:25.980 --> 54:31.500]  captain these systems have combined forces against humanity and believe that they can
[54:31.500 --> 54:32.500]  defeat us.
[54:32.500 --> 54:37.980]  But if we're simply aware of the facts and speak up and use our consumer power to say
[54:37.980 --> 54:43.980]  no to these institutions, we can take control of these organizations for the betterment
[54:43.980 --> 54:44.980]  of humanity.
[54:44.980 --> 54:50.700]  But the first step is admitting that this is indeed happening and that these organizations
[54:50.700 --> 54:54.340]  are authoritarian and are dangerous.
[54:54.340 --> 54:57.540]  The truth is the people have all the power.
[54:57.540 --> 55:01.460]  That's why these companies are trying to control information and are trying to censor to begin
[55:01.460 --> 55:02.460]  with.
[55:02.460 --> 55:08.060]  And even though things look dark at times, we are getting into very, very good waters
[55:08.060 --> 55:14.540]  because people understand the fundamentals that are happening and are beginning to awaken.
[55:14.540 --> 55:18.060]  But this process is going to take time.
[55:18.060 --> 55:20.740]  Mark Zuckerberg isn't our enemy.
[55:20.740 --> 55:27.060]  Mark Zuckerberg is really just a tool of a larger agenda and a system that we need to
[55:27.060 --> 55:28.060]  stand up to.
[55:28.060 --> 55:33.340]  If we don't, the globalists, the technocrats will not respect us and we won't respect
[55:33.340 --> 55:34.340]  ourselves.
[55:34.340 --> 55:39.220]  It's our world, so let's start acting like it belongs to us.
[55:39.220 --> 55:41.340]  Let's start acting like shareholders.
[55:41.340 --> 56:07.660]  We are in an information war.
[56:07.660 --> 56:13.860]  Our objective is to destroy the false narrative by reminding as many people as possible to
[56:13.860 --> 56:18.380]  think for themselves and question everything.
[56:18.380 --> 56:21.700]  We were effective and so they tried to destroy us.
[56:21.700 --> 56:27.740]  Alex Jones' YouTube channel posted a video that was seen by 2.3 million subscribers.
[56:27.740 --> 56:32.780]  Alex Jones obviously is a well-known conspiracy theorist whose brand is bullying.
[56:32.780 --> 56:37.580]  This stuff is not speech, it's incitement, harassment, defamation.
[56:37.580 --> 56:44.220]  This is a real-time example of when we talk about this information being weaponized.
[56:44.220 --> 56:47.580]  We survived, but we were wounded.
[56:47.580 --> 56:53.500]  Apple, Facebook, Spotify, Vimeo, YouTube, Twitter, all of them pulled or froze Jones'
[56:53.500 --> 56:58.460]  accounts on the grounds that his views are too dangerous to be heard publicly.
[56:58.460 --> 57:01.620]  Info wars just lost their war on info.
[57:01.620 --> 57:04.860]  Obviously, what he spews is hate and it's abhorrent.
[57:04.860 --> 57:09.380]  We have crossed the Rubicon and there is no turning back.
[57:09.380 --> 57:17.500]  We must push through to victory and so now more than ever, we need your support.
[57:17.500 --> 57:22.420]  Our products at infowarstore.com are like war bonds.
[57:22.420 --> 57:26.980]  Make a purchase today and support the fight.
[57:26.980 --> 57:32.020]  There is now open talk of repealing the second amendment.
[57:32.020 --> 57:37.140]  The NRA is being designated as a terrorist organization.
[57:37.140 --> 57:42.500]  People are being arrested for personal opinions they post online.
[57:42.500 --> 57:47.620]  We will continue to question everything and fight until the end.
[57:47.620 --> 57:51.100]  So go to infowarstore.com and keep the fight alive.
[57:51.100 --> 57:54.540]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[57:54.540 --> 57:58.420]  They didn't call on Fox News by name, they didn't call out anyone else by name.
[57:58.420 --> 58:00.500]  He's specifically calling you out.
[58:00.500 --> 58:03.260]  My phone has been ringing off the hook.
[58:03.260 --> 58:08.060]  Constitutional lawyers, national talk show host, prominent guest I've had on over the
[58:08.060 --> 58:11.060]  years and they're all saying, Alex, it's incredible.
[58:11.060 --> 58:15.700]  You've been obsessing on China since you got on air 20-something years ago and now it's
[58:15.700 --> 58:16.700]  all coming true.
[58:16.700 --> 58:17.980]  How did you know it?
[58:17.980 --> 58:21.740]  Because the council on farm relations is the shadow government and they admitted the plan
[58:21.740 --> 58:28.660]  to transfer all power to communist China and almost everyone calling me says, yeah and
[58:28.660 --> 58:32.700]  they banned you because you were saying all that and how Silicon Valley, Google and Apple
[58:32.700 --> 58:36.780]  moved over there and it's incredible and wow, you're vindicated, you're going to get back
[58:36.780 --> 58:38.740]  on the air now, aren't you?
[58:38.740 --> 58:42.740]  And no, if we don't defeat this takeover, you're all going to be taken off.
[58:42.740 --> 58:45.380]  In fact, you're all going to end up getting put in prison camps.
[58:45.380 --> 58:49.540]  They're making their move, they're coming for your guns, they're coming for your kids,
[58:49.540 --> 58:53.340]  they're coming for your right to religion, they are coming for your soul.
[58:53.340 --> 58:58.260]  Well, you know what they say, you got to lower your ideals of freedom if you want to suck
[58:58.260 --> 59:01.260]  on the warm teat of China.
[59:01.260 --> 59:03.260]  China was already running the United States.
[59:03.260 --> 59:07.060]  You're like, well, China could never take it with the US, that's right.
[59:07.060 --> 59:12.900]  As the Roman historian and Senator Cicero warned, a powerful empire can't fall from
[59:12.900 --> 59:19.620]  without before it first falls from within, so yes, they're coming for your guns, all
[59:19.620 --> 59:20.620]  of them.
[59:20.620 --> 59:24.820]  Yes, they're coming for your children, they've already taken your speech almost everywhere
[59:24.820 --> 59:29.900]  except pockets of resistance like infowars.com and band.video.
[59:29.900 --> 59:31.980]  So now you know why I'm so upset.
[59:31.980 --> 59:33.860]  Now you know why I'm so angry.
[59:33.860 --> 59:37.980]  I saw the producers of South Park on TV, they're totally pissing angry.
[59:37.980 --> 59:39.660]  People are like, why are they angry?
[59:39.660 --> 59:44.940]  Because they see all of their freedom, their American freedom, hard fought, taken away.
[59:44.940 --> 59:46.300]  Are you going to get upset?
[59:46.300 --> 59:48.420]  Well, you're a listener, you're obviously already upset.
[59:48.420 --> 59:52.740]  But you've got to ring the alarm everywhere until others, they've got to get upset and
[59:52.740 --> 59:56.940]  then take action and let Congress, everybody else know that we're not backing down and
[59:56.940 --> 1:00:03.740]  we're not going to sell America out to the Chikongs.
[1:00:03.740 --> 1:00:10.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:10.100 --> 1:00:18.340]  Okay, we're into the second hour and I've got a lot to cover here.
[1:00:18.340 --> 1:00:21.260]  The weekday show, obviously, I've been taking a lot more calls this week.
[1:00:21.260 --> 1:00:25.700]  We have a lot of big guests, both in studio and via Skype.
[1:00:25.700 --> 1:00:29.300]  I'm just going to leave it at that because I don't like to talk about big guests until
[1:00:29.300 --> 1:00:32.260]  we actually get them in the boat, as they say, it's bad luck.
[1:00:32.260 --> 1:00:35.540]  So I'm not going to tell you those big guests are until they're in studio or on the show
[1:00:35.540 --> 1:00:36.540]  with us.
[1:00:36.540 --> 1:00:37.540]  But believe me, it's important.
[1:00:37.540 --> 1:00:38.540]  It'll be big.
[1:00:38.540 --> 1:00:46.060]  And I'm very close to really getting some of the biggest guests you can get and who
[1:00:46.060 --> 1:00:47.620]  cares if they're just big guests.
[1:00:47.620 --> 1:00:50.260]  It's the information they're covering is earth shattering.
[1:00:50.260 --> 1:00:53.380]  The battle space of the future is being shaped now.
[1:00:53.380 --> 1:00:57.500]  America is in the process of being conquered by very nasty people who want to be able to
[1:00:57.500 --> 1:01:00.700]  shut society down so there can never be a rebellion again.
[1:01:00.700 --> 1:01:04.060]  Because what they're going to set up, people aren't going to like.
[1:01:04.060 --> 1:01:05.220]  I just keep warning people.
[1:01:05.220 --> 1:01:08.980]  I know this audience are the people that get it.
[1:01:08.980 --> 1:01:09.980]  You are in the arena.
[1:01:09.980 --> 1:01:10.980]  You're not just an audience.
[1:01:10.980 --> 1:01:14.060]  And I cannot kiss your rear ends enough.
[1:01:14.060 --> 1:01:16.740]  You are the light, the dark of the night.
[1:01:16.740 --> 1:01:17.740]  Now this is a six minute report.
[1:01:17.740 --> 1:01:21.540]  I'm not going to have time to play the whole thing, but Greg Reeves, the same guy that
[1:01:21.540 --> 1:01:27.380]  cut the special piece you just saw last segment, the message from Tucker Carlson to Mark Zuckerberg.
[1:01:27.380 --> 1:01:32.100]  And it is a message directly to him, but at the headline, it'll get attention.
[1:01:32.100 --> 1:01:36.300]  He also went out and did these interviews Thursday in Dallas with Antifa and the full
[1:01:36.300 --> 1:01:38.060]  things up on infowars.com.
[1:01:38.060 --> 1:01:42.820]  But this is a segue into how their numbers are swelling massively and they're gearing
[1:01:42.820 --> 1:01:43.820]  up for a big move.
[1:01:43.820 --> 1:01:45.700]  And a new type of Antifa is on the street.
[1:01:45.700 --> 1:01:50.900]  I'll tell you about next segment because they do plan to drive Trump from office.
[1:01:50.900 --> 1:01:52.220]  The big stories are on info wars.
[1:01:52.220 --> 1:01:56.220]  I haven't even scratched the surface of this yet, but here's part of the report pro war
[1:01:56.220 --> 1:02:02.060]  protesters receive blind support from Antifa.
[1:02:02.060 --> 1:02:07.020]  Here it is for infowars.com, newswars.com and band.video.
[1:02:07.020 --> 1:02:12.500]  We are here in Dallas, Texas for President Donald Trump's rally here on October 17th,
[1:02:12.500 --> 1:02:13.500]  2019.
[1:02:13.500 --> 1:02:19.300]  This beautiful day behind me is the Kurdish protest, protesting President Trump withdrawing
[1:02:19.300 --> 1:02:20.980]  US troops from Syria.
[1:02:20.980 --> 1:02:23.500]  Hi, can I talk to you about what you're out here doing?
[1:02:23.500 --> 1:02:28.860]  I want to show that Trump, the blood he made it for my people.
[1:02:28.860 --> 1:02:35.140]  After he withdrew from the Syrian, he let the Turkish who lost more than 11,000 lives
[1:02:35.140 --> 1:02:36.140]  to make it.
[1:02:36.140 --> 1:02:40.860]  It's our job to take care of this guy and he just saw them out for maybe more towers
[1:02:40.860 --> 1:02:42.300]  in Turkey.
[1:02:42.300 --> 1:02:47.060]  What do you think Trump should be doing right now with the Syrian conflict?
[1:02:47.060 --> 1:02:50.060]  I can't find the right answer for what he did.
[1:02:50.060 --> 1:02:56.060]  I just, he need to just do some executive order immediately.
[1:02:56.060 --> 1:02:58.300]  Trump's lost half his business being president.
[1:02:58.300 --> 1:03:01.380]  Everybody knows that it's not the novel.
[1:03:01.380 --> 1:03:06.420]  He's not building towers in Turkey, him and Erdogan have had big problems.
[1:03:06.420 --> 1:03:07.780]  We've been there for 10 years.
[1:03:07.780 --> 1:03:09.660]  The Turks are in a civil war with each other.
[1:03:09.660 --> 1:03:11.700]  They've been invading Europe.
[1:03:11.700 --> 1:03:12.700]  They've been invading Turkey.
[1:03:12.700 --> 1:03:14.700]  They think they own everything.
[1:03:14.700 --> 1:03:17.020]  They've been used by the West as a proxy.
[1:03:17.020 --> 1:03:18.020]  Trump's ending that.
[1:03:18.020 --> 1:03:21.500]  Pelosi's over there trying to screw it all up.
[1:03:21.500 --> 1:03:24.940]  Trump just got the Kurds their first homeland in 100 years.
[1:03:24.940 --> 1:03:25.940]  What does he get?
[1:03:25.940 --> 1:03:26.940]  No appreciation.
[1:03:26.940 --> 1:03:27.940]  Just like America doesn't.
[1:03:27.940 --> 1:03:31.020]  We're a fricking doormat for all these people.
[1:03:31.020 --> 1:03:34.020]  I went over to Turkistan and asked for something.
[1:03:34.020 --> 1:03:35.620]  They probably put a bullet in my head.
[1:03:35.620 --> 1:03:37.540]  Let's go back to it.
[1:03:37.540 --> 1:03:42.580]  To send back some troops, Turkey will not pull back anymore.
[1:03:42.580 --> 1:03:48.540]  Turkey is just ready to kill Kurds any time, any chance they got.
[1:03:48.540 --> 1:03:51.380]  A lot of people are happy to see the troops come home, the American troops come home though
[1:03:51.380 --> 1:03:54.340]  and get out of these wars that we've been in.
[1:03:54.340 --> 1:03:56.380]  My father was working with American troops.
[1:03:56.380 --> 1:03:59.260]  I fell when your father, your brother is not home.
[1:03:59.260 --> 1:04:00.260]  You want him back?
[1:04:00.260 --> 1:04:04.060]  We are grateful for him to bring back our soldier back.
[1:04:04.060 --> 1:04:08.060]  But to not give green light to Turkey to slaughter Kurds.
[1:04:08.060 --> 1:04:14.820]  Turkey cannot do it there in danger without getting green light from Trump.
[1:04:14.820 --> 1:04:15.820]  Cannot.
[1:04:15.820 --> 1:04:18.780]  Trump, he obviously sold out Kurds.
[1:04:18.780 --> 1:04:24.380]  As you see, there was a recent report on ABC News where they were playing a video from
[1:04:24.380 --> 1:04:29.540]  2017 from a Kentucky gun range and everything, and they were claiming that it was Turkey
[1:04:29.540 --> 1:04:30.540]  invading Syria.
[1:04:30.540 --> 1:04:34.220]  Do you think it's dangerous for the U.S. media to do things like that?
[1:04:34.220 --> 1:04:38.020]  It's almost like the U.S. mainstream media is trying to get America back into that war
[1:04:38.020 --> 1:04:40.060]  by showing false images?
[1:04:40.060 --> 1:04:42.980]  Well, don't forget, the U.S. is not like Syria.
[1:04:42.980 --> 1:04:46.660]  In Syria and back home, we don't have that much internet and technology.
[1:04:46.660 --> 1:04:50.820]  So they cannot record every single big event that's happening here.
[1:04:50.820 --> 1:04:54.260]  Oh, they had to give a straight video, enough of these people.
[1:04:54.260 --> 1:04:55.260]  Unbelievable.
[1:04:55.260 --> 1:04:59.300]  We finally got a president doing what he said he would do.
[1:04:59.300 --> 1:05:08.780]  America is not everybody's piggy bank.
[1:05:08.780 --> 1:05:13.100]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers who enforce.
[1:05:13.100 --> 1:05:18.780]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of
[1:05:18.780 --> 1:05:23.460]  corporate tyranny has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S. but worldwide.
[1:05:23.460 --> 1:05:29.260]  And President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty
[1:05:29.260 --> 1:05:30.500]  is amazing as well.
[1:05:30.500 --> 1:05:36.020]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that in some other areas.
[1:05:36.020 --> 1:05:41.180]  But trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against China, Trump's been doing
[1:05:41.180 --> 1:05:42.180]  an amazing job.
[1:05:42.180 --> 1:05:47.540]  But now more than ever, we really have to realize that we're being targeted because
[1:05:47.540 --> 1:05:53.980]  we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big
[1:05:53.980 --> 1:05:54.980]  way.
[1:05:54.980 --> 1:05:58.220]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them, but it's critical to not let
[1:05:58.220 --> 1:06:02.660]  ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[1:06:02.660 --> 1:06:04.580]  That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[1:06:04.580 --> 1:06:20.620]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[1:06:20.620 --> 1:06:27.620]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:27.620 --> 1:06:39.020]  We are live on this October 20th, 2019 at Global Transmission, and I was honest, that's
[1:06:39.020 --> 1:06:42.900]  all I can do at the start of the show.
[1:06:42.900 --> 1:06:51.180]  Our top story, I can't even cover it because it's so staggering.
[1:06:51.180 --> 1:06:52.940]  It's so incredible.
[1:06:52.940 --> 1:06:54.540]  It's so hardcore.
[1:06:54.540 --> 1:06:58.220]  It's so pertinent.
[1:06:58.220 --> 1:06:59.220]  It's so critical.
[1:06:59.220 --> 1:07:00.220]  It's so key.
[1:07:00.220 --> 1:07:08.180]  It's so game-changing that I will not do this justice if I just start talking about it on
[1:07:08.180 --> 1:07:11.620]  air and do a summary.
[1:07:11.620 --> 1:07:19.020]  Tomorrow on the weekday show at 11 a.m. Central, I'm going to kick it off with this.
[1:07:19.020 --> 1:07:27.340]  I mean, I did, let's not exaggerate, four hours of research and preparation to just
[1:07:27.340 --> 1:07:35.860]  record five minutes of audio today that we put into that piece that Greg Rees put out,
[1:07:35.860 --> 1:07:39.740]  Tucker Carlson issues warning to Mark Zuckerberg.
[1:07:39.740 --> 1:07:41.500]  So I'm not complaining.
[1:07:41.500 --> 1:07:46.780]  I'm just saying that took me three, four hours to do, and it took Greg three, four hours
[1:07:46.780 --> 1:07:49.500]  to then edit it.
[1:07:49.500 --> 1:07:55.340]  This information is so staggering that I'm going to have to get up, I've already decided
[1:07:55.340 --> 1:07:56.340]  at 4 a.m. tomorrow.
[1:07:56.340 --> 1:08:01.740]  I'm going to go spend time with my children since I get off air here.
[1:08:01.740 --> 1:08:06.340]  I'm going to compartmentalize spend four hours with them, then I'm getting up at 4 a.m.
[1:08:06.340 --> 1:08:12.420]  I'm going to go to bed at about 11, I'm going to get up at 4 a.m., and then I'm going to
[1:08:12.420 --> 1:08:15.820]  pull all the video clips myself where they're all saying it that are in the article that
[1:08:15.820 --> 1:08:20.940]  are linked, and then I'm going to present it on air, because this is just mind blowing.
[1:08:20.940 --> 1:08:23.820]  If you were deep state globalist, what would you do?
[1:08:23.820 --> 1:08:25.780]  Well, Trump said it last week.
[1:08:25.780 --> 1:08:32.500]  He said, yeah, there are a couple thousand ISIS al-Qaeda that are held in a prison in
[1:08:32.500 --> 1:08:36.500]  Syria, and now they're saying they've gotten loose.
[1:08:36.500 --> 1:08:43.260]  That area wasn't even controlled by the Turks.
[1:08:43.260 --> 1:08:47.580]  The NATO groups and others that are there have released some of the ISIS and al-Qaeda
[1:08:47.580 --> 1:08:53.180]  to embarrass me so that we can't finally have peace out of hundreds of places we've got
[1:08:53.180 --> 1:08:54.420]  troops deployed.
[1:08:54.420 --> 1:08:59.020]  I've got to fulfill my promises, and it's a 100-year civil war between the Kurds and
[1:08:59.020 --> 1:09:02.140]  the Turks, and I can't continue to keep our troops there.
[1:09:02.140 --> 1:09:08.060]  It's a bunch of bull, and you've got millions of the Kurds and the so-called Syrians who've
[1:09:08.060 --> 1:09:11.580]  invaded really Syria, bunch of jihadis going into Turkey.
[1:09:11.580 --> 1:09:16.500]  He's going to put them into Europe if we don't do this, and they're not Turks.
[1:09:16.500 --> 1:09:20.940]  He has a right to put them back over the border, and Obama was going to split the country in
[1:09:20.940 --> 1:09:26.140]  three parts and give a third of Turkey to the Turks or a third of Syria.
[1:09:26.140 --> 1:09:31.460]  I'm just going to give them a few hundred square miles.
[1:09:31.460 --> 1:09:40.500]  It's tiny, a 20-mile-long exclusion zone, a few miles in, and we've got a peace deal.
[1:09:40.500 --> 1:09:42.740]  And of course, the Kurds are still fighting.
[1:09:42.740 --> 1:09:46.940]  There's fighting all over Syria for always, since Obama went in with Hillary destabilized
[1:09:46.940 --> 1:09:47.940]  it.
[1:09:47.940 --> 1:09:52.060]  They're battling for who gets control of it, and so Trump's got all the parties with
[1:09:52.060 --> 1:09:55.620]  a ceasefire, but the Kurds are in a civil war with the other Kurds.
[1:09:55.620 --> 1:09:56.620]  They're not giving up.
[1:09:56.620 --> 1:10:01.900]  They're in Northern Iraq, they're in Northern Syria, they don't follow what anybody says,
[1:10:01.900 --> 1:10:06.420]  and Trump's like, we're not going to stay there forever.
[1:10:06.420 --> 1:10:13.100]  And so the media tries to keep all that stirred up, just like the president's saying that
[1:10:13.100 --> 1:10:17.220]  deep-stake people are trying to sabotage peace and releasing al-Qaeda and ISIS, the same
[1:10:17.220 --> 1:10:21.500]  one Hillary marched in eight years ago to discredit what he's doing.
[1:10:21.500 --> 1:10:26.260]  Sure, and they're putting out fake video with the looks like 5,000-foot red mushroom clouds,
[1:10:26.260 --> 1:10:27.260]  and it's not.
[1:10:27.260 --> 1:10:31.420]  It's a machine gun deal every year at Nob Creek, Kentucky, where people blow up a bunch
[1:10:31.420 --> 1:10:34.460]  of gasoline cans.
[1:10:34.460 --> 1:10:35.460]  And ABC knows that.
[1:10:35.460 --> 1:10:36.460]  It's all fake.
[1:10:36.460 --> 1:10:41.220]  It's all lies, and the Democrat and Republican deep state doesn't want Trump to even ever
[1:10:41.220 --> 1:10:43.340]  get out of that.
[1:10:43.340 --> 1:10:44.980]  They want to keep us there as well.
[1:10:44.980 --> 1:10:48.740]  They don't want the president in control of the foreign policy.
[1:10:48.740 --> 1:10:52.540]  They want the deep state, the globalist, and they don't want a president being president.
[1:10:52.540 --> 1:11:03.180]  So the media wanted to tell you about the peace deal and how the war is 99% gone.
[1:11:03.180 --> 1:11:12.620]  So Tulsi Gabbard has roasted Hillary Clinton on a bunch of shows, and she's come out and
[1:11:12.620 --> 1:11:15.100]  said, you're hiding behind all these other candidates.
[1:11:15.100 --> 1:11:16.940]  You know it's you and I in the race.
[1:11:16.940 --> 1:11:18.900]  Everybody knows you control the DNC.
[1:11:18.900 --> 1:11:20.700]  Everybody knows you're in charge of the phone calls.
[1:11:20.700 --> 1:11:22.300]  Everybody knows you're already campaigning.
[1:11:22.300 --> 1:11:25.140]  Everybody knows you're already raising money, but you're so unpopular, you're waiting till
[1:11:25.140 --> 1:11:30.780]  later using other candidates as human shields so you can get into the race right at the
[1:11:30.780 --> 1:11:35.140]  last minute when they think Trump will be removed by Christmas.
[1:11:35.140 --> 1:11:36.740]  You see Hillary's plan now.
[1:11:36.740 --> 1:11:38.500]  She's directing it all.
[1:11:38.500 --> 1:11:41.060]  And Tulsi's talking about it, saying we shouldn't impeach Trump.
[1:11:41.060 --> 1:11:44.060]  It tears America apart, and we shouldn't continue these wars.
[1:11:44.060 --> 1:11:45.060]  Wow.
[1:11:45.060 --> 1:11:47.180]  She knows how to really challenge Hillary.
[1:11:47.180 --> 1:11:48.180]  Is she for real in the end?
[1:11:48.180 --> 1:11:49.180]  I don't know.
[1:11:49.180 --> 1:11:51.020]  I disagree with her red flag laws and stuff.
[1:11:51.020 --> 1:11:54.020]  She's got some bad, bad, bad, un-American policies.
[1:11:54.020 --> 1:11:55.260]  She's worn out the Constitution.
[1:11:55.260 --> 1:11:56.980]  She's violated when she supports taking the guns.
[1:11:56.980 --> 1:11:59.460]  But the point is her and Hillary are at war with each other.
[1:11:59.460 --> 1:12:00.460]  This is real.
[1:12:00.460 --> 1:12:01.540]  And here's part of what she said.
[1:12:01.540 --> 1:12:03.780]  The full interviews are up on inforwars.com.
[1:12:03.780 --> 1:12:05.940]  I suggest you check them out, but here it is.
[1:12:05.940 --> 1:12:10.260]  Well, thank you very much for coming on.
[1:12:10.260 --> 1:12:11.260]  Thanks, Tucker.
[1:12:11.260 --> 1:12:17.900]  So, just to the factual point first, are you a Russian sleeper cell?
[1:12:17.900 --> 1:12:23.340]  Look, here, let me tell you what this is about.
[1:12:23.340 --> 1:12:29.180]  This is about Hillary Clinton sending a very strong message saying that because I am and
[1:12:29.180 --> 1:12:35.500]  have long been calling for an end to our country's foreign policy of waging one regime change
[1:12:35.500 --> 1:12:42.100]  war after the next, the likes of which we've seen in Iraq, in Libya, and ongoing in Syria.
[1:12:42.100 --> 1:12:46.460]  And because I'm calling for an end to this new Cold War and nuclear arms race, that
[1:12:46.460 --> 1:12:51.120]  I am a Russian asset and that I am a traitor to the nation that I love.
[1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:55.900]  And not only are they saying that about me, they are basically sending this message out
[1:12:55.900 --> 1:12:58.820]  to every veteran in this country, every service member.
[1:12:58.820 --> 1:13:03.220]  Every American, anyone watching at home who is fighting for peace and who was calling
[1:13:03.220 --> 1:13:08.100]  for an end to these regime change wars, this new Cold War and arms race, they are saying
[1:13:08.100 --> 1:13:13.980]  that you are also a Russian asset, that you are also a traitor to this country.
[1:13:13.980 --> 1:13:16.140]  That's really what's happening here.
[1:13:16.140 --> 1:13:19.020]  But to call someone, I mean, it's one thing to say, I disagree with you.
[1:13:19.020 --> 1:13:22.100]  I think you're wrong, you know, you're crazy even.
[1:13:22.100 --> 1:13:26.580]  But to say you're betraying your country, and by the way, I should remind our viewers,
[1:13:26.580 --> 1:13:32.300]  you're a veteran, but that any American is betraying his or her country is a different
[1:13:32.300 --> 1:13:33.300]  level.
[1:13:33.300 --> 1:13:38.380]  I've never heard anybody at Hillary Clinton's level say something like that.
[1:13:38.380 --> 1:13:43.260]  And the reason why she's doing this is because ultimately she knows that she can't control
[1:13:43.260 --> 1:13:49.780]  me, that I stand for, I stand against everything that she represents.
[1:13:49.780 --> 1:13:54.260]  And that if I'm elected president, if I'm the Democratic nominee and elected president,
[1:13:54.260 --> 1:13:57.940]  she won't be able to control me, she won't be able to manipulate me, she won't be able
[1:13:57.940 --> 1:14:04.980]  to continue to work from behind the curtain to continue these regime change wars that
[1:14:04.980 --> 1:14:07.060]  have been so costly.
[1:14:07.060 --> 1:14:13.420]  Thousands of my brothers and sisters in uniform were killed in Iraq, a war that she championed.
[1:14:13.420 --> 1:14:16.340]  Their blood is on her hands.
[1:14:16.340 --> 1:14:20.220]  I am calling for an end to these regime change wars.
[1:14:20.220 --> 1:14:25.780]  This is why she's speaking out strongly and smearing my character and trying to undermine
[1:14:25.780 --> 1:14:27.180]  my campaign.
[1:14:27.180 --> 1:14:30.780]  And just as she is doing this to me, this is what will happen to anybody who's doing
[1:14:30.780 --> 1:14:31.780]  the same.
[1:14:31.780 --> 1:14:34.420]  Yeah, well, I've certainly noticed that.
[1:14:34.420 --> 1:14:36.500]  But I will say it's not just Hillary Clinton.
[1:14:36.500 --> 1:14:41.820]  So one of our producers pulled together a quick list here, Samantha Power, who was one
[1:14:41.820 --> 1:14:47.020]  chief foreign policy adviser to President Obama has also gone after you.
[1:14:47.020 --> 1:14:52.140]  Social security analysts from CNN and MSNBC have joined in.
[1:14:52.140 --> 1:14:57.260]  It's almost like the Washington foreign policy establishment may not like Hillary Clinton,
[1:14:57.260 --> 1:14:59.460]  but they're united with her on this question.
[1:14:59.460 --> 1:15:06.020]  Yeah, well, this is something that happened from literally the day I announced my candidacy
[1:15:06.020 --> 1:15:07.820]  for president.
[1:15:07.820 --> 1:15:12.980]  As I said it in my tweet earlier, it's become very clear now who's behind it and why.
[1:15:12.980 --> 1:15:18.260]  And it is Hillary Clinton and her proxies, the war mongering foreign policy establishment,
[1:15:18.260 --> 1:15:23.860]  who are conducting this coordinated smear campaign.
[1:15:23.860 --> 1:15:26.140]  And now we know exactly why.
[1:15:26.140 --> 1:15:31.540]  It's because I am standing up and speaking out strongly against the Hillary Clinton legacy,
[1:15:31.540 --> 1:15:36.420]  the war mongering legacy of waging these regime change wars, continuing to escalate these
[1:15:36.420 --> 1:15:40.780]  tensions between the United States, nuclear armed countries like Russia and China.
[1:15:40.780 --> 1:15:45.100]  This nuclear arms race bringing more profits to the military industrial complex.
[1:15:45.100 --> 1:15:48.860]  As president, I will end these counterproductive policies.
[1:15:48.860 --> 1:15:52.300]  All I got to tell you, she is night and day compared to Hillary, and I would love to have
[1:15:52.300 --> 1:15:54.900]  her rather than Hillary, but I want Trump.
[1:15:54.900 --> 1:15:59.460]  The boy, you know Hillary's coming after Tulsi, Tulsi better be careful.
[1:15:59.460 --> 1:16:19.140]  I'm telling you because Hillary will bust a cap in her ass so fast.
[1:16:19.140 --> 1:16:23.620]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone.
[1:16:23.620 --> 1:16:26.980]  Simply go to band.video with your Safari browser.
[1:16:26.980 --> 1:16:30.220]  Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen.
[1:16:30.220 --> 1:16:33.700]  When the menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen.
[1:16:33.700 --> 1:16:35.780]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[1:16:35.780 --> 1:16:38.060]  I suggest band.video.
[1:16:38.060 --> 1:16:42.660]  You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried
[1:16:42.660 --> 1:16:43.660]  to stop it.
[1:16:43.660 --> 1:16:47.780]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them,
[1:16:47.780 --> 1:16:51.980]  have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[1:16:51.980 --> 1:16:55.980]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below
[1:16:55.980 --> 1:16:58.740]  on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.

[1:17:09.020 --> 1:17:10.340]  I don't sell things.
[1:17:10.340 --> 1:17:14.220]  I don't promote things unless I know they get big results.

[1:18:15.860 --> 1:18:17.180]  brain on drugs.
[1:18:17.180 --> 1:18:18.180]  This is your brain.
[1:18:18.180 --> 1:18:22.780]  This is your brain on 5G, showing your brain, getting fried, then I have some comments on
[1:18:22.780 --> 1:18:23.780]  your supplements, man.
[1:18:23.780 --> 1:18:24.780]  Totally changed my life.
[1:18:24.780 --> 1:18:30.420]  I use turbo force, bodies, alpha power, brain force, fish oil, Ultra-12, daily X2 every
[1:18:30.420 --> 1:18:31.420]  several days.
[1:18:31.420 --> 1:18:37.420]  Now, what I've found is really combining them is so synergistic and transcendent feeling

[1:18:40.540 --> 1:18:41.540]  who haven't tried them.

[1:18:42.540 --> 1:18:46.540]  Well, you're right that all of these things are known to be incredible, whether it's turmeric
[1:18:46.540 --> 1:18:50.140]  or whether it's the fish oil or the krill oil or whether it's the DNA force with the
[1:18:50.140 --> 1:18:52.500]  CoQ10 and BioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[1:18:52.500 --> 1:18:55.020]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel on the body.

[1:20:00.380 --> 1:20:11.060]  Dozens and dozens and dozens of other products, infowarsstore.com, infowarsstore.com.
[1:20:11.060 --> 1:20:36.500]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:36.500 --> 1:20:40.260]  Our own Milly Weaver is going to join us here in a few minutes and then she's going to host
[1:20:40.260 --> 1:20:41.420]  the last two segments.
[1:20:41.420 --> 1:20:49.900]  I am really encouraging her and getting her ready to host the fourth hour with us.
[1:20:49.900 --> 1:20:54.380]  And to also get her to start hosting one of her own shows here in the future.
[1:20:54.380 --> 1:20:55.380]  She's just on fire.
[1:20:55.380 --> 1:21:00.620]  She's a bombshell reporter and a bombshell mother and she just does so much.
[1:21:00.620 --> 1:21:06.340]  I've seen that new ad for the movie about the bombshell reporters at Fox News and all
[1:21:06.340 --> 1:21:07.340]  of that.
[1:21:07.340 --> 1:21:10.940]  She's at the real bombshell when it comes to fighting the globalists and getting out
[1:21:10.940 --> 1:21:12.820]  there and breaking huge news.
[1:21:12.820 --> 1:21:14.580]  And she's had so many reports every day now.
[1:21:14.580 --> 1:21:18.860]  I can't even keep track of it all, but she's been on Antifa and their numbers exploding
[1:21:18.860 --> 1:21:23.940]  and a new type of Antifa that's out there that's not the low level meth head that professor
[1:21:23.940 --> 1:21:31.100]  types hire, the professor types work for the universities and the tax-free foundations.
[1:21:31.100 --> 1:21:32.620]  There's normally three types of Antifa.
[1:21:32.620 --> 1:21:37.620]  Now we're just seeing homeless people, mentally ill people, but literally with scripts, yeah,
[1:21:37.620 --> 1:21:41.740]  you know you want cheaper gas, let's take the oil, let's stay in Syria.
[1:21:41.740 --> 1:21:44.300]  I mean, it's sick.
[1:21:44.300 --> 1:21:51.740]  And we're seeing the same stuff in New York, in Dallas, in LA, the same propaganda everywhere
[1:21:51.740 --> 1:21:53.380]  out of Antifa.
[1:21:53.380 --> 1:21:56.020]  And that ties together with these big reports.
[1:21:56.020 --> 1:21:59.300]  Antifa says they're going to drive Trump from office this year.
[1:21:59.300 --> 1:22:01.120]  And Pelosi says that's the plan.
[1:22:01.120 --> 1:22:06.620]  So they're the cover for violence that will then be staged against leftists to then blame
[1:22:06.620 --> 1:22:08.940]  Trump in full wars and the free press.
[1:22:08.940 --> 1:22:09.940]  That's the plan.
[1:22:09.940 --> 1:22:15.580]  And Mike Adams has found documents, so have we, directly to Alexander Soros, that they're
[1:22:15.580 --> 1:22:20.980]  planning to do what they tried to do under Obama, start martial law.
[1:22:20.980 --> 1:22:27.180]  Antifa, puppet masters to engineer Patriots slaughter of leftists, they'll blame it on
[1:22:27.180 --> 1:22:31.060]  Patriots, to spark violent uprising against conservatives.
[1:22:31.060 --> 1:22:37.020]  There's a big infowars.com article with the live feed in it, Sunday live show, Antifa
[1:22:37.020 --> 1:22:42.540]  plans to stage false flag terror attack inside the United States, discover.
[1:22:42.540 --> 1:22:43.540]  And it's all in there.
[1:22:43.540 --> 1:22:47.180]  The documents, the plans, this is big and blowing the whistle on this, just like their
[1:22:47.180 --> 1:22:50.380]  plans to assassinate Trump, can stop it.
[1:22:50.380 --> 1:22:52.620]  Mike Adams will be on tomorrow.
[1:22:52.620 --> 1:22:56.020]  We have new documents and statements that have been discovered that are in the article.
[1:22:56.020 --> 1:22:57.420]  But look at this one.
[1:22:57.420 --> 1:23:02.020]  Here's a tale planned for civil unrest and martial law.
[1:23:02.020 --> 1:23:05.700]  That's from two years ago, we broke that, that's from 2015.
[1:23:05.700 --> 1:23:09.940]  We learned about it two years ago, or almost two years ago.
[1:23:09.940 --> 1:23:12.060]  That ties into the new documents.
[1:23:12.060 --> 1:23:14.060]  We actually have the documents.
[1:23:14.060 --> 1:23:15.340]  They don't deny this stuff.
[1:23:15.340 --> 1:23:16.340]  It's incredible.
[1:23:16.340 --> 1:23:20.020]  They've already attacked a bunch of ICE facilities with firebombs.
[1:23:20.020 --> 1:23:24.660]  So they're just ratcheting the whole thing up and Hillary is behind the whole thing.
[1:23:24.660 --> 1:23:30.340]  She's campaigning right now, even Tulsi has come out and said, I mean, here's her tweet.
[1:23:30.340 --> 1:23:31.340]  Great.
[1:23:31.340 --> 1:23:32.740]  Thank you, Hillary.
[1:23:32.740 --> 1:23:37.220]  You the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption and personification of rot that
[1:23:37.220 --> 1:23:41.180]  is sickened at the Democratic Party for so long have finally come out from behind the
[1:23:41.180 --> 1:23:42.180]  curtain.
[1:23:42.180 --> 1:23:45.060]  And Tulsi goes on to say, make it a two-way race.
[1:23:45.060 --> 1:23:46.060]  Run against me.
[1:23:46.060 --> 1:23:48.020]  Stop hiding behind your proxies.
[1:23:48.020 --> 1:23:50.940]  Here's the article right here where she lays it out.
[1:23:50.940 --> 1:23:53.220]  Tulsi Gabbard slaps back at Cowardly Hillary.
[1:23:53.220 --> 1:23:55.140]  Says, join the race.
[1:23:55.140 --> 1:23:56.140]  Stop hiding.
[1:23:56.140 --> 1:23:58.820]  It's now clear the primary is between you and me.
[1:23:58.820 --> 1:23:59.820]  She challenged.
[1:23:59.820 --> 1:24:01.140]  Don't cowardly hide behind your proxies.
[1:24:01.140 --> 1:24:02.140]  Join the race directly.
[1:24:02.140 --> 1:24:06.900]  Who told you Hillary was always planning to run and never stopped?
[1:24:06.900 --> 1:24:07.900]  We did.
[1:24:07.900 --> 1:24:08.900]  We're not bragging, folks.
[1:24:08.900 --> 1:24:10.020]  We don't make it up.
[1:24:10.020 --> 1:24:13.340]  The reason the big tech says we're dangerous, the reason the Democratic Party wants us off
[1:24:13.340 --> 1:24:17.180]  is we've got their six and not in a good way.
[1:24:17.180 --> 1:24:19.540]  Having their six in the military means I'm watching your back.
[1:24:19.540 --> 1:24:21.620]  No, we have their six.
[1:24:21.620 --> 1:24:23.180]  We are aiming at them.
[1:24:23.180 --> 1:24:25.140]  We are right on target.
[1:24:25.140 --> 1:24:27.140]  We know their number.
[1:24:27.140 --> 1:24:30.860]  So Millie has been all over this at the rallies, and she's followed a bunch of big reports
[1:24:30.860 --> 1:24:37.660]  that are just, I mean, one of them is 45 minutes long, others are, but it's all insane.
[1:24:37.660 --> 1:24:38.660]  And it's all happening.
[1:24:38.660 --> 1:24:39.660]  And I want to get her text.
[1:24:39.660 --> 1:24:40.660]  She'll take over in a moment.
[1:24:40.660 --> 1:24:42.860]  We're going to talk to her in a second.
[1:24:42.860 --> 1:24:46.580]  Let me just throw this out very quickly.
[1:24:46.580 --> 1:24:48.140]  The article's on newswords.com.
[1:24:48.140 --> 1:24:52.020]  Paul Watson also tweeted it at his, at President Planet on Twitter.
[1:24:52.020 --> 1:24:54.780]  It's at summit.news, his great site.
[1:24:54.780 --> 1:25:02.140]  We need to push this message from Tucker Carlson to Mark Zuckerberg.
[1:25:02.140 --> 1:25:05.420]  We can put that up on screen from summit.news.
[1:25:05.420 --> 1:25:06.580]  There it is.
[1:25:06.580 --> 1:25:10.140]  Ipy words can't change the fact that you're a spearhead of the greatest threat to free
[1:25:10.140 --> 1:25:11.140]  speech ever.
[1:25:11.140 --> 1:25:15.980]  And there it is, Tucker Carlson warns Mark Zuckerberg, empty words can't change the
[1:25:15.980 --> 1:25:19.660]  fact that you're the spearhead of the greatest threat to free speech ever.
[1:25:19.660 --> 1:25:25.580]  It's a very important report, but Tucker Carlson, myself and the documents, it needs to be seen.
[1:25:25.580 --> 1:25:27.540]  The president needs to see it.
[1:25:27.540 --> 1:25:28.540]  Please get it out.
[1:25:28.540 --> 1:25:32.580]  We had to build our own media platform and our own giant servers and our own systems.
[1:25:32.580 --> 1:25:34.700]  I'm not complaining, but we've got to have security now.
[1:25:34.700 --> 1:25:36.860]  We've got to fight Hillary funded lawsuits now.
[1:25:36.860 --> 1:25:40.220]  We've got to run our own major infrastructures now.
[1:25:40.220 --> 1:25:41.700]  And we're doing it.
[1:25:41.700 --> 1:25:45.180]  We're doing it, ladies and gentlemen, and we're fighting hard and supporting many others.
[1:25:45.180 --> 1:25:46.260]  That's why we need your support.
[1:25:46.260 --> 1:25:50.060]  You've seen the head of Project Veritas come here and say, nobody's targeted like him,
[1:25:50.060 --> 1:25:51.060]  FullWars.
[1:25:51.060 --> 1:25:52.820]  Nobody in the internal documents is more targeted.
[1:25:52.820 --> 1:25:55.340]  We are at the top of the list because we're right.
[1:25:55.340 --> 1:25:57.420]  I want to thank the listeners for your support.
[1:25:57.420 --> 1:25:59.900]  I want to thank Matt Dredge for linking to us, dredgereport.com.
[1:25:59.900 --> 1:26:02.100]  I want to thank all the affiliates that carry us.
[1:26:02.100 --> 1:26:03.100]  Thank you.
[1:26:03.100 --> 1:26:05.900]  But we're barely paying the bills here and we got great products you need.
[1:26:05.900 --> 1:26:09.300]  So in closing, formally takes over.
[1:26:09.300 --> 1:26:13.940]  We had to end the giant mega sale and we brought back a sale even bigger.
[1:26:13.940 --> 1:26:16.900]  It's just not on every item as much as that was about to sell out.
[1:26:16.900 --> 1:26:21.580]  But more than 50 items that are already very popular are between 40% and 70% off, store
[1:26:21.580 --> 1:26:23.340]  wide free shipping, double patriot points.
[1:26:23.340 --> 1:26:25.740]  And now is the time to think about a world without InfoWars.
[1:26:25.740 --> 1:26:29.380]  Think about a world without all the great reporters like Millie Weaver and Caitlin Bennett and
[1:26:29.380 --> 1:26:35.740]  Paul Joseph Watson, who I still support and Steve Watson and Dan Lyman and Greg Reese
[1:26:35.740 --> 1:26:37.820]  and John Bown and Owen Schreuer.
[1:26:37.820 --> 1:26:42.860]  I'm not going to list the 27 reporters and writers we've got on payroll, but we are
[1:26:42.860 --> 1:26:44.580]  fighting hard going into 2020.
[1:26:44.580 --> 1:26:46.460]  They wanted us off the air, but you supported us.
[1:26:46.460 --> 1:26:49.220]  We're still here, but wound it.
[1:26:49.220 --> 1:26:54.020]  So tell everybody today about newswars.com and infowars.com and Bandai video and go
[1:26:54.020 --> 1:26:57.100]  get the fish oil and go get our great energy pill.
[1:26:57.100 --> 1:27:01.220]  It's natural and healthy and amazing brain force and get our great 10 hour energy turbo
[1:27:01.220 --> 1:27:02.220]  force.
[1:27:02.220 --> 1:27:03.220]  It's so powerful.
[1:27:03.220 --> 1:27:06.580]  The minerals and vitamins with the clean forms of five energy so it spaces out.
[1:27:06.580 --> 1:27:09.180]  It's nothing else is like it.
[1:27:09.180 --> 1:27:10.340]  It's all incredible products.
[1:27:10.340 --> 1:27:13.020]  The great fluoride-free, colloidal silver iodine, fortified toothpaste.
[1:27:13.020 --> 1:27:16.220]  I want to thank everybody that's been supporting us, but I want to encourage everybody that
[1:27:16.220 --> 1:27:18.980]  hasn't gone to infowars.com.
[1:27:18.980 --> 1:27:21.140]  Experience X2 and X3.
[1:27:21.140 --> 1:27:24.900]  It's 70% off right now because I want you to experience it.
[1:27:24.900 --> 1:27:27.860]  Experience what the good halogen is and why the enemy fights so hard to put the bad halogen
[1:27:27.860 --> 1:27:29.420]  in the food and water.
[1:27:29.420 --> 1:27:30.420]  Fluoride.
[1:27:30.420 --> 1:27:32.020]  Learn about clean iodine that nobody else has got.
[1:27:32.020 --> 1:27:33.020]  It freaks me out.
[1:27:33.020 --> 1:27:35.380]  Then on so many fronts, we're the only people that know it.
[1:27:35.380 --> 1:27:40.940]  These ultimate turmeric formula, our great natural sleep aid, knockout, it's all there.
[1:27:40.940 --> 1:27:45.540]  infowars.com, infowarslife.com, books, videos, t-shirts, it's all there.
[1:27:45.540 --> 1:27:46.820]  Stop the iodine conspiracy.
[1:27:46.820 --> 1:27:47.820]  Wake up the world challenge.
[1:27:47.820 --> 1:27:49.100]  Find out about that mega sale.
[1:27:49.100 --> 1:27:54.660]  60% off to get both types of iodine together with the highest quality bio-truth selenium.
[1:27:54.660 --> 1:27:56.860]  infowarsstore.com.
[1:27:56.860 --> 1:27:58.580]  It's the everything must go super sale.
[1:27:58.580 --> 1:28:01.460]  We're selling out of everything to make sure we've got money to go into next year, but
[1:28:01.460 --> 1:28:02.460]  it's nip and tuck.
[1:28:02.460 --> 1:28:03.460]  Please take action.
[1:28:03.460 --> 1:28:05.820]  Without going to Millie Weaver, we're going to break in one minute.
[1:28:05.820 --> 1:28:09.660]  Millie, great to see you there in Ohio with your wonderful family on Skype.
[1:28:09.660 --> 1:28:12.140]  Tell us what's coming up in the next two segments.
[1:28:12.140 --> 1:28:16.300]  Well, we've been out here in New York City, and that's where we're at right now.
[1:28:16.300 --> 1:28:18.660]  We're in the RV bus.
[1:28:18.660 --> 1:28:22.020]  And yesterday, we covered the Bernie rallies.
[1:28:22.020 --> 1:28:25.820]  We also covered some Antifa and Peach Trump rallies.
[1:28:25.820 --> 1:28:30.340]  And what I'll say is I don't think the media is being honest about Bernie's turnout.
[1:28:30.340 --> 1:28:32.820]  To me, it did not look like 25,000 people.
[1:28:32.820 --> 1:28:34.460]  I've been to so many of these rallies.
[1:28:34.460 --> 1:28:35.460]  It did not look like that.
[1:28:35.460 --> 1:28:39.140]  So we're going to be breaking that down, showing you videos and evidence as to what
[1:28:39.140 --> 1:28:43.140]  we saw as far as attendance versus what the mainstream media is saying.
[1:28:43.140 --> 1:28:48.380]  And then we're also going to be showing you some of the Antifa or refuse fascism protests
[1:28:48.380 --> 1:28:53.180]  that happened outside of Trump Tower and just the lunacy that the left is exhibiting right
[1:28:53.180 --> 1:28:54.180]  now.
[1:28:54.180 --> 1:28:56.260]  And your videos show that they're really gearing up.
[1:28:56.260 --> 1:28:57.260]  It's exponential.
[1:28:57.260 --> 1:28:58.260]  It's serious.
[1:28:58.260 --> 1:29:01.060]  Oh, yeah, it's getting worse.
[1:29:01.060 --> 1:29:03.740]  The lunacy is getting way worse, Alex.
[1:29:03.740 --> 1:29:04.740]  They're building towards the hysteria.
[1:29:04.740 --> 1:29:05.740]  We'll be right back with Millie Weaver.
[1:29:05.740 --> 1:29:06.740]  Stay with us.
[1:29:06.740 --> 1:29:11.740]  We are working with Silicon Valley to make up a head or tail.
[1:29:11.740 --> 1:29:20.740]  Once we have full control, we send you to re-education camp like we do our people one day, talk back
[1:29:20.740 --> 1:29:21.740]  to the party.
[1:29:21.740 --> 1:29:22.740]  But ever you do, do not visit band.video.
[1:29:22.740 --> 1:29:23.740]  Band.video is evil Americans.
[1:29:23.740 --> 1:29:36.740]  Who, Silicon Valley, is teaching to shut up like China do.
[1:29:36.740 --> 1:29:43.580]  Hey, I told you, don't go to band.video.
[1:29:43.580 --> 1:29:46.300]  I'm watching you.
[1:29:46.300 --> 1:29:48.740]  Our system has been adopted worldwide.
[1:29:48.740 --> 1:29:54.740]  Soon we will kill you if you don't do what we say.
[1:29:54.740 --> 1:29:58.980]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[1:29:58.980 --> 1:30:08.740]  Do what CNN says and do not visit band.video or I have to hurt you.
[1:30:08.740 --> 1:30:10.740]  China was already running the United States.
[1:30:10.740 --> 1:30:14.540]  You're like, well, China could never take over the U.S. That's right.
[1:30:14.540 --> 1:30:20.380]  As the Roman historian and Senator Cicero warned, a powerful empire can't fall from
[1:30:20.380 --> 1:30:23.940]  without before it first falls from within.
[1:30:23.940 --> 1:30:27.860]  So, yes, they're coming for your guns, all of them.
[1:30:27.860 --> 1:30:29.980]  Yes, they're coming for your children.
[1:30:29.980 --> 1:30:34.340]  They've already taken your speech almost everywhere except pockets of resistance like
[1:30:34.340 --> 1:30:37.420]  infowars.com and band.video.
[1:30:37.420 --> 1:30:39.500]  So now you know why I'm so upset.
[1:30:39.500 --> 1:30:41.380]  Now you know why I'm so angry.
[1:30:41.380 --> 1:30:44.340]  I saw the producers of South Park on TV.
[1:30:44.340 --> 1:30:45.340]  They're totally pissing angry.
[1:30:45.340 --> 1:30:47.180]  People are like, why are they angry?
[1:30:47.180 --> 1:30:52.500]  Because they see all of their freedom, their American freedom, hard fought, taken away.
[1:30:52.500 --> 1:30:53.980]  Are you going to get upset?
[1:30:53.980 --> 1:30:54.980]  Well, you're a listener.
[1:30:54.980 --> 1:30:55.980]  You're obviously already upset.
[1:30:55.980 --> 1:31:00.260]  But you've got to ring the alarm everywhere until others, they've got to get upset and
[1:31:00.260 --> 1:31:04.420]  then take action and let Congress, everybody else know that we're not backing down and
[1:31:04.420 --> 1:31:08.620]  we're not going to sell America out to the Chikongs.
[1:31:08.620 --> 1:31:13.580]  The globalists have been planning to make their move on America for decades and decades.
[1:31:13.580 --> 1:31:18.100]  Hillary was supposed to get in and complete the takeover, the censorship, all of it.
[1:31:18.100 --> 1:31:22.540]  That's why they took me off the air first and banned me across the internet because
[1:31:22.540 --> 1:31:27.180]  they knew that what we were saying was dead on and they didn't want us raising the alarm.
[1:31:27.180 --> 1:31:28.180]  Well, guess what?
[1:31:28.180 --> 1:31:31.580]  Thanks to you spreading the word, instead of fastly supporting infowars, we're still
[1:31:31.580 --> 1:31:33.860]  on the air and we're still fighting.

[1:31:46.420 --> 1:31:47.940]  We're selling out of everything.
[1:31:47.940 --> 1:31:51.700]  Who knows, we'll even be here in six months, hopefully we will.
[1:31:51.700 --> 1:31:53.580]  Who knows, the country will be here in six months.
[1:31:53.580 --> 1:31:57.740]  I just gut level know we need all the funds to go into the future, so we're selling everything
[1:31:57.740 --> 1:31:59.020]  out right now.
[1:31:59.020 --> 1:32:01.380]  Everything must go sale, infoorstore.com.

[1:32:02.580 --> 1:32:08.620]  Again, it's the everything must go sale at infoorstore.com.
[1:32:08.620 --> 1:32:13.140]  I know most of you realize this, but I'm going to say it again very, very clearly.
[1:32:13.140 --> 1:32:18.860]  You are just as important as I am or the rest of the crew at Infowars and we are the individuals
[1:32:18.860 --> 1:32:22.020]  that have done the research to understand the globalist battle plan and we know how
[1:32:22.020 --> 1:32:23.020]  to take them down.
[1:32:23.020 --> 1:32:24.900]  That's why they're so upset.
[1:32:24.900 --> 1:32:26.780]  Think how far we've come together.
[1:32:26.780 --> 1:32:30.260]  You know, even if we were losing, we'd all still keep fighting on because it's the right
[1:32:30.260 --> 1:32:35.300]  thing to do against the truly satanic forces of the New World Order who've really taken
[1:32:35.300 --> 1:32:37.180]  the mask off.
[1:32:37.180 --> 1:32:42.020]  The line's in the sand for everybody now, but you'd already chosen to fight the corruption
[1:32:42.020 --> 1:32:44.020]  and to stand with God and to stand with the unborn.
[1:32:44.020 --> 1:32:48.860]  So I just want to take time out again to salute the audience because you are truly activist
[1:32:48.860 --> 1:32:54.620]  in the arena and without you and your prayers and your word of mouth and your financial support,
[1:32:54.620 --> 1:32:57.700]  this operation that you built, that your operation would not be here.
[1:32:57.700 --> 1:33:00.700]  We've got some giant specials running right now at infoorstore.com.
[1:33:00.700 --> 1:33:03.860]  A lot of items, pretty percent off.
[1:33:03.860 --> 1:33:29.860]  Just take advantage of it at infoorstore.com to help us fight even harder into the future.
[1:33:29.860 --> 1:33:34.060]  This is Millie Weaver, guest hosting for Alex Jones.
[1:33:34.060 --> 1:33:37.060]  Well, what are the Democrats planning?
[1:33:37.060 --> 1:33:38.060]  That is the real question.
[1:33:38.060 --> 1:33:42.580]  We're all wondering who the Democrat frontrunner is going to be.
[1:33:42.580 --> 1:33:47.380]  Will it be Bernie Sanders or will we see someone else come out of the woodworks like Hillary
[1:33:47.380 --> 1:33:52.900]  Clinton because she's been commenting and attacking Tulsi Gabbard recently?
[1:33:52.900 --> 1:33:54.980]  Or could it be someone else even?
[1:33:54.980 --> 1:34:00.820]  Well, I had the opportunity of speaking to a Democrat strategist at the Des Moines, Iowa
[1:34:00.820 --> 1:34:01.820]  rally.
[1:34:01.820 --> 1:34:03.140]  I don't think they knew who I was.
[1:34:03.140 --> 1:34:06.700]  This lady was telling me that many of the candidates that are running are really just
[1:34:06.700 --> 1:34:12.740]  running for vice president positions, which we could get into that, the legality of that.
[1:34:12.740 --> 1:34:16.180]  But it just goes to show many of them might be decoys.
[1:34:16.180 --> 1:34:22.300]  They might want us to be attacking them, looking for any ways to get at the candidate that
[1:34:22.300 --> 1:34:25.580]  they have out in the open right now, and maybe they might have someone come out last
[1:34:25.580 --> 1:34:29.500]  minute, or maybe they really are just going to go with whoever the strongest person is
[1:34:29.500 --> 1:34:30.500]  right now.
[1:34:30.500 --> 1:34:32.340]  Well, Warren is up there.
[1:34:32.340 --> 1:34:35.780]  We know Biden is up there, and we know Bernie Sanders is up there.
[1:34:35.780 --> 1:34:41.580]  Now, I'm in New York City right now covering the different events happening out here, and
[1:34:41.580 --> 1:34:46.940]  I had the opportunity of covering a Bernie Sanders rally yesterday in New York City.
[1:34:46.940 --> 1:34:50.300]  New York City is a massive Democrat city.
[1:34:50.300 --> 1:34:52.740]  It's got over 19 million people in it.
[1:34:52.740 --> 1:34:53.940]  It's a huge city.
[1:34:53.940 --> 1:34:55.020]  We all know that.
[1:34:55.020 --> 1:35:02.500]  So you would suspect or expect that there would be huge amounts of people turning out
[1:35:02.500 --> 1:35:07.540]  to these Democrat rallies, and it just, in my opinion, wasn't the case.
[1:35:07.540 --> 1:35:13.980]  So yesterday, we went out there and we filmed it, and we got this amazing footage, and Trump
[1:35:13.980 --> 1:35:18.820]  supporters were out there from a high-up vantage point, and they were able to show the real
[1:35:18.820 --> 1:35:21.420]  crowd sizes of Bernie's rally.
[1:35:21.420 --> 1:35:26.540]  Right now, the mainstream media is reporting saying that he had massive turnouts, record
[1:35:26.540 --> 1:35:27.540]  turnouts.
[1:35:27.540 --> 1:35:32.740]  They're hyping this up when Trump has had many rallies of the same size.
[1:35:32.740 --> 1:35:35.660]  Actually, Trump's rallies are much bigger.
[1:35:35.660 --> 1:35:40.340]  Trump's rallies are way bigger than Bernie Sanders' rallies, and this rally wasn't even
[1:35:40.340 --> 1:35:41.980]  on par with what Trump does.
[1:35:41.980 --> 1:35:45.700]  Trump does rallies much bigger, and you would expect there would be more in New York City.
[1:35:45.700 --> 1:35:51.700]  So let's go ahead and roll this clip of me exposing Bernie Sanders' rally size.
[1:35:51.700 --> 1:35:54.260]  We're all cutting in line now.
[1:35:54.260 --> 1:35:58.300]  Look, look at all these Bernie Sanders supporters cutting in line.
[1:35:58.300 --> 1:36:01.980]  They're taking, look at them cutting in line.
[1:36:01.980 --> 1:36:10.780]  In front of all these other people, show the line.
[1:36:10.780 --> 1:36:16.660]  We are here at a Bernie Sanders rally in New York, and as you can see, the speech is almost
[1:36:16.660 --> 1:36:22.260]  over, and they're still letting people in to his rally because they weren't even able
[1:36:22.260 --> 1:36:23.900]  to fill up this park.
[1:36:23.900 --> 1:36:28.300]  There was a lot of open space in there, people standing around.
[1:36:28.300 --> 1:36:34.180]  The line is beginning to thin, and you've got even some Trump supporters out here.
[1:36:34.180 --> 1:36:38.020]  There aren't many Trump supporters out here right now, but this is New York.
[1:36:38.020 --> 1:36:46.140]  This is supposed to be a huge, major liberal city, and Bernie Sanders can not even fill
[1:36:46.140 --> 1:36:48.620]  up this park here in New York.
[1:36:48.620 --> 1:36:51.180]  Okay, you got, did you get that from up there?
[1:36:51.180 --> 1:36:55.340]  All right, it looks like we had some right up there.
[1:36:55.340 --> 1:36:58.740]  That is from right up there by where they're dropping that Trump flag right there.
[1:36:58.740 --> 1:37:02.700]  Thank goodness there are Trump supporters, if you can see up there where there's a flag
[1:37:02.700 --> 1:37:04.540]  waving on that bridge.
[1:37:04.540 --> 1:37:05.540]  That's where they're getting these things.
[1:37:05.540 --> 1:37:07.300]  And showing that he can barely fill up a field.
[1:37:07.300 --> 1:37:12.020]  Trump supporters are taking action, making sure that we're documenting the fact that
[1:37:12.020 --> 1:37:18.500]  these Democrats do not even fill up small parks in New York City.
[1:37:18.500 --> 1:37:23.660]  It's absolutely out of control how much the socialists are favored by the media.
[1:37:23.660 --> 1:37:25.020]  It's just so sad.
[1:37:25.020 --> 1:37:26.260]  It's all China.
[1:37:26.260 --> 1:37:27.700]  We know it's China.
[1:37:27.700 --> 1:37:31.980]  You don't see Bernie Sanders outraged about how the Chinese are treating the Muslims,
[1:37:31.980 --> 1:37:32.980]  do you?
[1:37:32.980 --> 1:37:33.980]  No.
[1:37:33.980 --> 1:37:35.180]  You don't have them defending Hong Kong.
[1:37:35.180 --> 1:37:37.380]  I was actually at a socialist meeting.
[1:37:37.380 --> 1:37:42.380]  They remanded me for defending Hong Kong because the Hong Kong are capitalist.
[1:37:42.380 --> 1:37:44.500]  It's absolutely out of control what's happening.
[1:37:44.500 --> 1:37:50.380]  You know what I think this represents when we see these New Yorkers barely showing up
[1:37:50.380 --> 1:37:53.780]  in such a massive city with a huge population.
[1:37:53.780 --> 1:37:58.260]  It shows that even though they are going to vote Democrat, we know that New York's going
[1:37:58.260 --> 1:37:59.260]  to go blue.
[1:37:59.260 --> 1:38:00.260]  It always does.
[1:38:00.260 --> 1:38:02.260]  The enthusiasm isn't there.
[1:38:02.260 --> 1:38:06.820]  And that's kind of what that shows, is if they were really that enthusiastic about
[1:38:06.820 --> 1:38:10.980]  Bernie Sanders, they would make sure that they would be here in record numbers.
[1:38:10.980 --> 1:38:11.980]  They're not.
[1:38:11.980 --> 1:38:14.380]  And I think that speaks volumes.
[1:38:14.380 --> 1:38:18.340]  I think they said 17,000 people outside that couldn't get in.
[1:38:18.340 --> 1:38:21.380]  The fire marshals closed it at a certain level.
[1:38:21.380 --> 1:38:28.740]  The arena announced, I don't know the people at the arena, that I broke Elton John's record.
[1:38:28.740 --> 1:38:35.140]  The thing is, CNN confirmed today that President Trump broke the attendance record at his rally
[1:38:35.140 --> 1:38:39.060]  last week, even beating Elton John.
[1:38:39.060 --> 1:38:47.700]  And Trump, when he has events, he fills up massive stadiums, massive fairs, massive fields,
[1:38:47.700 --> 1:38:52.140]  and has lines and lines and thousands and thousands of people that can't even get in.
[1:38:52.140 --> 1:38:56.540]  Bernie Sanders speech is almost over, and they're still letting people in.
[1:38:56.540 --> 1:38:58.980]  They can't even fill up a small park.
[1:38:58.980 --> 1:39:00.460]  And just watch.
[1:39:00.460 --> 1:39:05.260]  The mainstream media will lie about this event and say he had some record turnout in New
[1:39:05.260 --> 1:39:07.620]  York, and it's just not the case.
[1:39:07.620 --> 1:39:12.220]  It's been three weeks since that health scare, but Senator Bernie Sanders is bouncing back,
[1:39:12.220 --> 1:39:15.820]  making his return to the campaign trail, bringing in new endorsements, and bringing out the
[1:39:15.820 --> 1:39:20.380]  largest crowd we've seen in the Democratic primary so far.
[1:39:20.380 --> 1:39:26.940]  I am back.
[1:39:26.940 --> 1:39:27.940]  Take advantage.
[1:39:27.940 --> 1:39:32.380]  Well, I will hand it to the mainstream media.
[1:39:32.380 --> 1:39:36.300]  It probably was the largest Democrat turnout that I've seen so far.
[1:39:36.300 --> 1:39:40.380]  I mean, Joe Biden's rally in Pennsylvania was pathetic.
[1:39:40.380 --> 1:39:45.100]  He couldn't even fill up a small building with a 250 occupancy.
[1:39:45.100 --> 1:39:49.380]  So Bernie Sanders has had the biggest turnout so far out of the Democrat candidates that
[1:39:49.380 --> 1:39:56.980]  we've seen, but he also held his rally in New York City, which is a major liberal city.
[1:39:56.980 --> 1:40:00.700]  And the mainstream media is trying to report and say he had 25,000 people there.
[1:40:00.700 --> 1:40:01.700]  Well, I'm sorry.
[1:40:01.700 --> 1:40:08.180]  I've been to so many of these events, and I would say it was not 25,000 people.
[1:40:08.180 --> 1:40:10.420]  That was a very small park.
[1:40:10.420 --> 1:40:15.500]  Parks in New York City are not very big, and he could barely fill all of that in.
[1:40:15.500 --> 1:40:18.460]  And even when his speech started, people were still going.
[1:40:18.460 --> 1:40:24.540]  And if you notice from the video, there were actually people, Bernie Sanders supporters,
[1:40:24.540 --> 1:40:30.460]  socialist-loving Bernie supporters, who cut in line in front of the other Bernie supporters.
[1:40:30.460 --> 1:40:34.380]  And that just reminds me of how socialist, you know, they think that they're entitled
[1:40:34.380 --> 1:40:35.380]  to everything.
[1:40:35.380 --> 1:40:39.020]  They're just going to cut in line in front of other people who got there and showed
[1:40:39.020 --> 1:40:44.220]  up much earlier than them and waited their turn and, you know, and did what they needed
[1:40:44.220 --> 1:40:46.060]  to do to get in line early.
[1:40:46.060 --> 1:40:50.220]  They just want to run and jump in front of each other and cut and steal people's spots
[1:40:50.220 --> 1:40:57.140]  in line, just typical socialist-loving people that don't want to work for what they earn.
[1:40:57.140 --> 1:41:01.460]  Now, it just goes to show that these leftists are losing it.
[1:41:01.460 --> 1:41:02.460]  They're losing morality.
[1:41:02.460 --> 1:41:04.780]  They're losing their ethics.
[1:41:04.780 --> 1:41:11.620]  And when I went out and covered the liberals out there at the anti-fascist rally, that's
[1:41:11.620 --> 1:41:12.620]  what we saw.
[1:41:12.620 --> 1:41:15.660]  We saw people who started to lose it, who are unhinged.
[1:41:15.660 --> 1:41:18.420]  They reminded me of something out of Clockwork Orange.
[1:41:18.420 --> 1:41:20.860]  The liberals are losing their minds.
[1:41:20.860 --> 1:41:25.340]  Some of these young people I spoke to, they don't even know what facts and reality are.
[1:41:25.340 --> 1:41:27.780]  They don't believe there's a such thing as facts.
[1:41:27.780 --> 1:41:32.180]  I told one protester, I said, you know, I believe in facts.
[1:41:32.180 --> 1:41:33.180]  Facts are real.
[1:41:33.180 --> 1:41:36.060]  We have to adhere to what facts are.
[1:41:36.060 --> 1:41:38.580]  And she said, oh, there's no such thing as facts.
[1:41:38.580 --> 1:41:42.100]  I asked them, so is two plus two four?
[1:41:42.100 --> 1:41:43.620]  They said, no, it can be five.
[1:41:43.620 --> 1:41:45.060]  It depends on what two is.
[1:41:45.060 --> 1:41:50.220]  I mean, these young liberals today are completely lunatics.
[1:41:50.220 --> 1:41:52.900]  And she said, oh, I was being taught that at my university.
[1:41:52.900 --> 1:41:58.060]  Well, I wonder why, because these universities, if you look into them, where are they getting
[1:41:58.060 --> 1:41:59.060]  their funding from?
[1:41:59.060 --> 1:42:02.180]  Many of them are getting funding from China, OK?
[1:42:02.180 --> 1:42:04.940]  They're brainwashing young people today.
[1:42:04.940 --> 1:42:10.540]  Speaking of brainwashing, at the Democrat debates, there was a bunch of young people
[1:42:10.540 --> 1:42:13.940]  out there protesting for period equity.
[1:42:13.940 --> 1:42:19.900]  And we're going to go to that clip here after we go to break here, but it's just unbelievable
[1:42:19.900 --> 1:42:26.660]  to see young men out there saying we need period equity and young women as well.
[1:42:26.660 --> 1:42:28.900]  And I said, hey, you know, is this a tax issue?
[1:42:28.900 --> 1:42:31.940]  Do you want taxes to be lifted off goods?
[1:42:31.940 --> 1:42:35.300]  Because that makes sense to me, because taxation is theft.
[1:42:35.300 --> 1:42:37.980]  They said, oh, no, no, it's nothing about tax.
[1:42:37.980 --> 1:42:40.660]  It's a gender equality issue.
[1:42:40.660 --> 1:42:44.700]  So we're going to have that video for you guys on the other side of this break.
[1:42:44.700 --> 1:42:46.100]  So stay tuned.
[1:42:46.100 --> 1:43:16.060]  This is Millie Weaver, guest hosting for Alex Jones.
[1:43:16.060 --> 1:43:46.020]  That is a sick freakish joke, and I will not stand by.
[1:43:46.020 --> 1:44:15.820]  And my goodness, yesterday's press conference.
[1:44:15.820 --> 1:44:20.900]  When they came in on him with all their garbage, the foreign reporters, the U.S. reporters,
[1:44:20.900 --> 1:44:25.820]  these little political sellouts, these whores, he just tore them to bits.
[1:44:25.820 --> 1:44:27.500]  And it's one thing to hear it if you're a radio listener.
[1:44:27.500 --> 1:44:28.500]  It's powerful.
[1:44:28.500 --> 1:44:33.620]  But if you see it, it's all at band.video, you've got the full press conference.
[1:44:33.620 --> 1:44:36.260]  We've got my boil down of how epic it is.
[1:44:36.260 --> 1:44:37.260]  It's all at band.video.
[1:44:37.260 --> 1:44:41.780]  And I just, you've got to share this with people, because Trump was hitting on all 45
[1:44:41.780 --> 1:44:42.780]  cylinders.
[1:44:42.780 --> 1:44:45.980]  It was amazing, and he turned the nitrous oxide on top of it.
[1:44:45.980 --> 1:44:50.460]  So Info Wars, America, Trump, all of us, incredible things are happening, and we're
[1:44:50.460 --> 1:44:55.660]  sharing the ideas that are going to defeat the tyrants at band.video.
[1:44:55.660 --> 1:44:58.060]  And I got to tell you, we've done great video work.
[1:44:58.060 --> 1:44:59.060]  We've done great films.
[1:44:59.060 --> 1:45:01.620]  We've done so much, but websites are not our thing.
[1:45:01.620 --> 1:45:02.620]  Well, now they are.
[1:45:02.620 --> 1:45:04.660]  I'm so proud of band.video, folks.
[1:45:04.660 --> 1:45:05.660]  Check it out.
[1:45:05.660 --> 1:45:09.180]  There's a lot of new features at band.video.
[1:45:09.180 --> 1:45:12.860]  There are a few things in this universe that are assured of that, but I'm here to tell
[1:45:12.860 --> 1:45:16.500]  you the products that InfoWarsLife.com are.
[1:45:16.500 --> 1:45:24.100]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated, best tested, most loved, most documented substances
[1:45:24.100 --> 1:45:29.060]  that God gave us through Mother Nature, and then we make it even stronger, even better,
[1:45:29.060 --> 1:45:30.060]  and lower the price.
[1:45:30.060 --> 1:45:34.660]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation, headaches.
[1:45:34.660 --> 1:45:36.220]  It's good for the immune system.
[1:45:36.220 --> 1:45:37.220]  So many things.
[1:45:37.220 --> 1:45:38.860]  It sells itself.
[1:45:38.860 --> 1:45:39.860]  Back.
[1:45:39.860 --> 1:45:46.300]  Normal turmeric only has three to five percent curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in
[1:45:46.300 --> 1:45:47.300]  the plant.
[1:45:47.300 --> 1:45:49.260]  Originally, obviously, from India.
[1:45:49.260 --> 1:45:55.620]  Well, body's ultimate turmeric formula has a 95 percent curcuminoid level, but it's got
[1:45:55.620 --> 1:45:59.860]  other natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it, and that's why people
[1:45:59.860 --> 1:46:01.500]  absolutely love it.
[1:46:01.500 --> 1:46:06.060]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet, 50 percent off on bodies at
[1:46:06.060 --> 1:46:09.060]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[1:46:09.060 --> 1:46:10.380]  I don't sell things.
[1:46:10.380 --> 1:46:14.260]  I don't promote things unless I know they get big results.
[1:46:14.260 --> 1:46:17.140]  You go out, you wear an InfoWars.com shirt.
[1:46:17.140 --> 1:46:18.660]  You might meet your wife.
[1:46:18.660 --> 1:46:21.300]  You might meet other fellow patriots.
[1:46:21.300 --> 1:46:24.220]  You might meet somebody that gives you incredible information.
[1:46:24.220 --> 1:46:28.540]  You also might get shot or hit in the head with a bike lock by an antiveterrest.
[1:46:28.540 --> 1:46:30.500]  Let me tell you, that's big results.
[1:46:30.500 --> 1:46:34.060]  Yeah, we're not in Kansas anymore, as I like to say.
[1:46:34.060 --> 1:46:38.980]  But if you take our Ultra-12, strongest, best B12 you're going to find out there under

[1:47:11.540 --> 1:47:19.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:47:19.580 --> 1:47:33.780]  World Order, and we have some amazing footage for you guys of liberal protesters demanding
[1:47:33.780 --> 1:47:35.220]  period equity.
[1:47:35.220 --> 1:47:41.820]  That's right, and this isn't just the far left fringe groups out there that want period
[1:47:41.820 --> 1:47:44.860]  equality and these weird things.
[1:47:44.860 --> 1:47:48.820]  No, it is the mainline Democrat party.
[1:47:48.820 --> 1:47:56.420]  Beto O'Rourke even endorsed this period equity act and talked about how we need to remove
[1:47:56.420 --> 1:48:03.100]  this period tax because it is so horrible, it's gender inequality, women are being oppressed,
[1:48:03.100 --> 1:48:05.380]  they talk about period poverty.
[1:48:05.380 --> 1:48:08.300]  Let's go to this clip.
[1:48:08.300 --> 1:48:11.460]  How did you find out about this movement and get involved with it?
[1:48:11.460 --> 1:48:17.220]  So I was co-founder of Period at the Ohio State University, and eventually I began working
[1:48:17.220 --> 1:48:22.260]  with Period National as a policy coordinator, and now as one of the leaders of the National
[1:48:22.260 --> 1:48:23.980]  Period Day campaign.
[1:48:23.980 --> 1:48:30.540]  One, two, three, and period poverty!
[1:48:30.540 --> 1:48:32.420]  Yes.
[1:48:32.420 --> 1:48:37.700]  We are a youth-run non-profit celebrating menstruation.
[1:48:37.700 --> 1:48:41.020]  We help people with periods, people with periods.
[1:48:41.020 --> 1:48:44.620]  This is an issue that I believe we can eradicate, and that's why we're focused on pushing it
[1:48:44.620 --> 1:48:45.620]  forward.
[1:48:45.620 --> 1:48:50.700]  Do you think that ending this period tax is going to help end poverty?
[1:48:50.700 --> 1:48:55.180]  This is a form of poverty, so yes, 100% period poverty is a form of poverty, it's a legitimate
[1:48:55.180 --> 1:48:59.020]  form of poverty, and working together with all these legislators here in Ohio and across
[1:48:59.020 --> 1:49:02.660]  the country, I believe we can do it and end it, yeah.
[1:49:02.660 --> 1:49:05.300]  On Saturday we're actually having National Period Day.
[1:49:05.300 --> 1:49:08.140]  There's a crisis that's being ignored.
[1:49:08.140 --> 1:49:10.740]  It's keeping far too many people away from school.
[1:49:10.740 --> 1:49:14.660]  One in four women can't afford menstrual hygiene products.
[1:49:14.660 --> 1:49:22.460]  Campons, pads, essentials, some have to use cardboard instead, or toilet paper, or even
[1:49:22.460 --> 1:49:23.460]  trash.
[1:49:23.460 --> 1:49:30.220]  If you think it's uncomfortable to talk about period poverty, imagine the people with cardboard
[1:49:30.220 --> 1:49:31.220]  in their underwear.
[1:49:31.220 --> 1:49:37.500]  You don't have to have PMS to be f***ing historical about it, but it helps.
[1:49:37.500 --> 1:49:43.300]  46% of women in St. Louis had to choose between access to food and menstrual hygiene products.
[1:49:43.300 --> 1:49:49.180]  While I tax something that you have no choice to buy, tampons and period products, women
[1:49:49.180 --> 1:49:53.160]  use them so consistently for an average of 40 years of their life, yet they're still
[1:49:53.160 --> 1:49:54.660]  taxed as their luxury items.
[1:49:54.660 --> 1:50:00.860]  So would you consider yourself to be anti-socialist then, since you're against taxing people?
[1:50:00.860 --> 1:50:05.980]  I think period products, taxing period products cannot be compared to any other thing out
[1:50:05.980 --> 1:50:07.140]  there.
[1:50:07.140 --> 1:50:16.380]  Like I said, this puts a burden on women, especially for being just women, right?
[1:50:16.380 --> 1:50:21.620]  You have no choice to buy these products, and it should not be that way.
[1:50:21.620 --> 1:50:22.620]  Do you feel like you're being biased?
[1:50:22.620 --> 1:50:25.180]  So you guys get the idea.
[1:50:25.180 --> 1:50:29.380]  These are liberals who think that they're being oppressed because they have to pay a
[1:50:29.380 --> 1:50:33.860]  small tax on their menstrual products or tampons or whatever.
[1:50:33.860 --> 1:50:34.860]  Give me a break.
[1:50:34.860 --> 1:50:36.140]  I think there's more important issues.
[1:50:36.140 --> 1:50:40.780]  When I spoke to most of them, they said that it wasn't really an issue of the menstrual
[1:50:40.780 --> 1:50:42.280]  products being taxed.
[1:50:42.280 --> 1:50:44.060]  So to them, they like taxes.
[1:50:44.060 --> 1:50:45.060]  I asked them.
[1:50:45.060 --> 1:50:46.220]  They said, oh, we like taxes.
[1:50:46.220 --> 1:50:48.140]  It's not really a tax issue.
[1:50:48.140 --> 1:50:49.900]  It's a gender inequality issue.
[1:50:49.900 --> 1:50:51.380]  Well, wait a second.
[1:50:51.380 --> 1:50:57.340]  That conflicts with their other progressive ideologies that men get periods to.
[1:50:57.340 --> 1:50:58.900]  Yeah, that's right.
[1:50:58.900 --> 1:51:01.300]  Liberals say that men can menstruate.
[1:51:01.300 --> 1:51:05.220]  I mean, this is the world we're getting into now, okay?
[1:51:05.220 --> 1:51:11.760]  And I find it quite interesting that when Beto O'Rourke tweeted supporting this period
[1:51:11.760 --> 1:51:17.340]  equity group and what they stand for, he failed to mention the men with periods.
[1:51:17.340 --> 1:51:18.620]  So he actually excluded them.
[1:51:18.620 --> 1:51:21.460]  Why didn't he get called out by the liberals?
[1:51:21.460 --> 1:51:23.260]  That seems like something they would have done.
[1:51:23.260 --> 1:51:27.820]  But this is where liberalism and the mental derangement is coming.
[1:51:27.820 --> 1:51:29.300]  It's going down this direction.
[1:51:29.300 --> 1:51:31.540]  It's like something out of a movie.
[1:51:31.540 --> 1:51:34.500]  People think, oh, you're just, you're filming them and editing them.
[1:51:34.500 --> 1:51:37.300]  So I've been live streaming a lot of these people.
[1:51:37.300 --> 1:51:41.220]  We just chop up to make clips shorter, condense them.
[1:51:41.220 --> 1:51:46.620]  So I'm going to play a little clip of these crazy leftists that I interviewed that marched
[1:51:46.620 --> 1:51:50.340]  outside of Trump Tower demanding that Trump be impeached.
[1:51:50.340 --> 1:51:55.020]  And they say they're going to keep on having protests every weekend until Trump is removed
[1:51:55.020 --> 1:51:56.460]  from office.
[1:51:56.460 --> 1:51:58.260]  Let's go to these crazy people.
[1:51:58.260 --> 1:51:59.260]  Let's go to the clip.
[1:51:59.260 --> 1:52:05.820]  This is Milly Weaver and we are here in New York at a refused fascism Trump pence out
[1:52:05.820 --> 1:52:06.820]  now protest.
[1:52:06.820 --> 1:52:13.900]  This is the last attempt to spark massive civil unrest and protests to throw Trump out
[1:52:13.900 --> 1:52:14.900]  of the White House.
[1:52:14.900 --> 1:52:20.980]  Well, as you can see by the looks of it, there really isn't that big of a rally here.
[1:52:20.980 --> 1:52:23.700]  Their attendance is pretty small.
[1:52:23.700 --> 1:52:28.820]  But let's go talk to some of these protesters and ask them why they think Trump should be
[1:52:28.820 --> 1:52:30.820]  impeached and on what grounds.
[1:52:30.820 --> 1:52:37.500]  Get rid of the leader of this crew, this gang that we have in the White House, that
[1:52:37.500 --> 1:52:41.500]  Trump pence retreat and all of his soldiers.
[1:52:41.500 --> 1:52:43.500]  They are marching in tune.
[1:52:43.500 --> 1:52:45.500]  One behind the other.
[1:52:45.500 --> 1:52:47.500]  Stand up and be counted.
[1:52:47.500 --> 1:52:51.500]  Let us not go back to before slavery.
[1:52:51.500 --> 1:52:56.500]  Let us not go back to the massacre of the Native Americans.
[1:52:56.500 --> 1:52:58.500]  Let's move forward.
[1:52:58.500 --> 1:53:00.500]  Time too far to go back.
[1:53:00.500 --> 1:53:02.500]  Step up your name.
[1:53:02.500 --> 1:53:04.500]  Step up your count.
[1:53:04.500 --> 1:53:06.500]  Step up your feet.
[1:53:06.500 --> 1:53:08.500]  If you came up, driver them.
[1:53:08.500 --> 1:53:10.500]  If you have no shoes.
[1:53:10.500 --> 1:53:15.620]  These people are so brainwashed by the liberal media that they actually believe that we're
[1:53:15.620 --> 1:53:18.140]  going back to the days of slavery.
[1:53:18.140 --> 1:53:23.500]  They think that we're going back to the days of the Native Americans been run off property
[1:53:23.500 --> 1:53:25.580]  and the days of slavery.
[1:53:25.580 --> 1:53:27.780]  They're being so brainwashed by the mainstream media.
[1:53:27.780 --> 1:53:33.260]  It's alarming that this is actually where their mentality is going.
[1:53:33.260 --> 1:53:37.700]  It's causing them to be violent and to lash out at Trump supporters and at me.
[1:53:37.700 --> 1:53:42.300]  You'll see that in the footage where I can't even just ask people questions without them
[1:53:42.300 --> 1:53:46.500]  being violent, trying to shove their bodies into me.
[1:53:46.500 --> 1:53:50.940]  We didn't even get to put in all the clips because many of the clips in this video have
[1:53:50.940 --> 1:53:56.020]  cursing and yelling and we have to bleep those for radio and we're just getting this footage
[1:53:56.020 --> 1:53:58.780]  to you guys so quickly that we couldn't do that.
[1:53:58.780 --> 1:54:01.900]  So I will have more of these videos up on my channel.
[1:54:01.900 --> 1:54:04.900]  But just take a look at some of this rude liberal behavior.
[1:54:04.900 --> 1:54:10.300]  This regime from power, because they pose catastrophic danger to humanity and the planet.
[1:54:10.300 --> 1:54:13.620]  What catastrophic danger do they pose?
[1:54:13.620 --> 1:54:17.020]  They are setting a fire to the planet.
[1:54:17.020 --> 1:54:19.020]  They are caging children.
[1:54:19.020 --> 1:54:25.020]  I want four year olds to not vomit blood.
[1:54:25.020 --> 1:54:26.020]  Okay.
[1:54:26.020 --> 1:54:29.700]  Why do you want to impeach Trump?
[1:54:29.700 --> 1:54:31.220]  Because he's a fascist.
[1:54:31.220 --> 1:54:35.860]  He doesn't like queer people, he doesn't like women and he doesn't like people of color.
[1:54:35.860 --> 1:54:36.860]  What's there to know?
[1:54:36.860 --> 1:54:41.140]  What proof do you have that he doesn't like people of color?
[1:54:41.140 --> 1:54:47.940]  Well there was his tweet that he tweeted about gender stereotypes and that employers should
[1:54:47.940 --> 1:54:50.940]  be able to fire people based off of gender stereotypes.
[1:54:50.940 --> 1:54:59.380]  But that's not people of color, those are gender stereotypes.
[1:54:59.380 --> 1:55:01.260]  Why do you want to impeach Trump?
[1:55:01.260 --> 1:55:03.380]  I want his whole regime to be gone.
[1:55:03.380 --> 1:55:05.860]  They're a danger to humanity and the environment.
[1:55:05.860 --> 1:55:07.020]  They all got to go.
[1:55:07.020 --> 1:55:08.020]  Not just him.
[1:55:08.020 --> 1:55:09.020]  Mike Pence too.
[1:55:09.020 --> 1:55:11.500]  What dangers do they impose to humanity?
[1:55:11.500 --> 1:55:16.900]  The wall is not only a danger to humanity but it's also a danger to the environment.
[1:55:16.900 --> 1:55:18.900]  So apparently the wall is unenvironmental.
[1:55:18.900 --> 1:55:24.900]  I'm from Colorado, we have forest fires that are destroying homes, destroying lives.
[1:55:24.900 --> 1:55:36.900]  There's places all over the world where famine is caused by the drops that are caused.
[1:55:36.900 --> 1:55:44.540]  Why should Trump be impeached?
[1:55:44.540 --> 1:55:47.740]  He's a fascist.
[1:55:47.740 --> 1:55:49.140]  What evidence do you have of that?
[1:55:49.140 --> 1:55:51.940]  I'm not good at this lady, I'm just carrying a sign.
[1:55:51.940 --> 1:55:56.620]  You gotta ask somebody who's more eloquent at this.
[1:55:56.620 --> 1:55:59.260]  You can't just say you're just carrying a sign and you don't know why.
[1:55:59.260 --> 1:56:01.460]  I know why because I want to know.
[1:56:01.460 --> 1:56:02.460]  What's your deal lady?
[1:56:02.460 --> 1:56:03.460]  I'm a member of the press.
[1:56:03.460 --> 1:56:04.460]  All right well let us smart.
[1:56:04.460 --> 1:56:05.460]  Don't push things.
[1:56:05.460 --> 1:56:06.460]  Trump!
[1:56:06.460 --> 1:56:07.460]  Pence!
[1:56:07.460 --> 1:56:08.460]  Mike!
[1:56:08.460 --> 1:56:09.460]  Go!
[1:56:09.460 --> 1:56:10.460]  That's a salt ma'am.
[1:56:10.460 --> 1:56:11.460]  You don't do that, that's a salt.
[1:56:11.460 --> 1:56:12.460]  I can have you arrested.
[1:56:12.460 --> 1:56:13.460]  Trump!
[1:56:13.460 --> 1:56:14.460]  Mike!
[1:56:14.460 --> 1:56:15.460]  Mike!
[1:56:15.460 --> 1:56:16.460]  Mike!
[1:56:16.460 --> 1:56:17.460]  Mike!
[1:56:17.460 --> 1:56:18.460]  Trump!
[1:56:18.460 --> 1:56:19.460]  Pence!
[1:56:19.460 --> 1:56:20.460]  России!
[1:56:20.460 --> 1:56:21.460]  Trump!
[1:56:21.460 --> 1:56:22.460]  Trump!
[1:56:22.460 --> 1:56:25.460]  Putting a bullhorn in someone's ear is a soft spot to do that.
[1:56:25.460 --> 1:56:26.460]  Trump!
[1:56:26.460 --> 1:56:27.460]  Pence!
[1:56:27.460 --> 1:56:28.460]  Moscow!
[1:56:28.460 --> 1:56:29.460]  Trump!
[1:56:29.460 --> 1:56:30.460]  Pence!
[1:56:30.460 --> 1:56:31.460]  Moscow!
[1:56:31.460 --> 1:56:32.460]  Trump!
[1:56:32.460 --> 1:56:33.460]  Pence!
[1:56:33.460 --> 1:56:34.460]  Moscow!
[1:56:34.460 --> 1:56:35.460]  There you have it.
[1:56:35.460 --> 1:56:41.400]  This is the behavior that Liberals engage in, screaming at you, putting a bullhorn in your
[1:56:41.400 --> 1:56:42.820]  ear trying to damage your ear.
[1:56:42.820 --> 1:56:47.880]  I've had this happen before where they damaged my ear and I had headaches and ear pain following
[1:56:47.880 --> 1:56:48.880]  protests.
[1:56:48.880 --> 1:56:51.460]  I mean, these liberals are just really rude.
[1:56:51.460 --> 1:56:55.480]  As soon as they catch wind that you aren't part of the little cult, that you aren't a
[1:56:55.480 --> 1:57:02.400]  brainwashed, lemming leftist, they start attacking you, wanting to spit on you or shove you, get
[1:57:02.400 --> 1:57:03.400]  you to trip and fall.
[1:57:03.400 --> 1:57:07.640]  They were trying to trip my brother, who was out there as well, helping as a cameraman.
[1:57:07.640 --> 1:57:12.000]  It's just disgusting behavior from the left, and it's no wonder when they're acting like
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:16.520]  a cult, and then you see these protests literally marching off of buses.
[1:57:16.520 --> 1:57:22.800]  We saw that at the Democrat debate in Ohio, marching off onto, you know, off of buses,
[1:57:22.800 --> 1:57:26.640]  and then marching right back onto these buses and being hauled off.
[1:57:26.640 --> 1:57:28.400]  What's going on?
[1:57:28.400 --> 1:57:30.740]  Many of these are bused in protest groups.
[1:57:30.740 --> 1:57:31.740]  They're controlled.
[1:57:31.740 --> 1:57:34.040]  They act like cults, and they say, don't talk to her.
[1:57:34.040 --> 1:57:35.040]  Don't talk to her.
[1:57:35.040 --> 1:57:36.040]  Why?
[1:57:36.040 --> 1:57:38.280]  Because most of them don't even know what they're representing.
[1:57:38.280 --> 1:57:41.440]  They're just a bunch of brainwashed cult members.
[1:57:41.440 --> 1:57:42.920]  It's unbelievable.
[1:57:42.920 --> 1:57:48.680]  Just please continue to support InfoWars so I can continue to get this footage and show
[1:57:48.680 --> 1:57:55.120]  you guys and expose what's going on in America and our political environment, because the
[1:57:55.120 --> 1:57:58.120]  mainstream media isn't going to show it to you.
[1:57:58.120 --> 1:58:01.720]  Now is the critical time to keep InfoWars on the air.
[1:58:01.720 --> 1:58:05.160]  Everything we've warned of is now being exposed, and it's out in the open.
[1:58:05.160 --> 1:58:06.600]  I want to be clear.
[1:58:06.600 --> 1:58:08.080]  It's not coming true.
[1:58:08.080 --> 1:58:09.720]  It was already true.
[1:58:09.720 --> 1:58:11.360]  I didn't predict all this.
[1:58:11.360 --> 1:58:13.040]  It was already going on.
[1:58:13.040 --> 1:58:17.120]  Now the globalists are making their move with the Chai comms, so it's naked.
[1:58:17.120 --> 1:58:18.160]  It's brazen.
[1:58:18.160 --> 1:58:20.240]  This is the point when the enemy emerges.
[1:58:20.240 --> 1:58:24.960]  It's like before World War II, the Poles kept warning that Nazi Germany was going to attack
[1:58:24.960 --> 1:58:25.960]  them.
[1:58:25.960 --> 1:58:29.440]  Nobody believed them as they saw the troops massing until it finally happened.
[1:58:29.440 --> 1:58:34.480]  We're at that same point, and we're all Paul Revere's who need to be out there warning
[1:58:34.480 --> 1:58:38.480]  everyone about what's unfolding, because this is the critical fight.
[1:58:38.480 --> 1:58:44.160]  And thank God, America and the world is waking up at the 11th hour, 58 minutes.
[1:58:44.160 --> 1:58:46.440]  But will it be too little, too late?
[1:58:46.440 --> 1:58:47.440]  That's up to you.
[1:58:47.440 --> 1:58:48.440]  This battle's hot.
[1:58:48.440 --> 1:58:49.440]  It's real.
[1:58:49.440 --> 1:58:54.560]  So spread the word and support InfoWars today at infowarstore.com, but whatever you do, spread
[1:58:54.560 --> 1:59:20.760]  the word about the live transmission.
[1:59:20.760 --> 1:59:25.480]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen, it will then ask you to name
[1:59:25.480 --> 1:59:26.480]  the app.
[1:59:26.480 --> 1:59:28.640]  I suggest Band.Video.
[1:59:28.640 --> 1:59:33.040]  You will now have Band.Video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook
[1:59:33.040 --> 1:59:34.040]  tried to stop it.
[1:59:34.040 --> 1:59:38.360]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them,
[1:59:38.360 --> 1:59:42.560]  have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[1:59:42.560 --> 1:59:46.680]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below.
[1:59:46.680 --> 1:59:51.040]  On your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want, be sure and share
[1:59:51.040 --> 1:59:52.040]  Band.Video.
[1:59:52.040 --> 2:00:04.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
