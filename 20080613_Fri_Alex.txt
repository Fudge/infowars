[00:00.000 --> 00:02.840]  What it sees is a little too revealing.
[00:02.840 --> 00:06.280]  Jack Fink live for us tonight at the airport to give us a closer look at this.
[00:06.280 --> 00:07.280]  Jack?
[00:07.280 --> 00:11.360]  Doug, they started using two body scanning machines here at the international terminal
[00:11.360 --> 00:12.360]  two days ago.
[00:12.360 --> 00:14.560]  They'll officially be launched on Friday.
[00:14.560 --> 00:20.720]  And while some passengers raise privacy concerns, most we spoke with, say, Safety First.
[00:20.720 --> 00:23.000]  Melanie Martin flies about twice a month.
[00:23.000 --> 00:27.680]  She's not comfortable with the new body scanning machines installed at DFW airport and others
[00:27.680 --> 00:29.280]  across the country.
[00:29.280 --> 00:32.200]  The devices reveal your body's intimate parts.
[00:32.200 --> 00:34.440]  We've shaded these pictures off TSA's website.
[00:34.440 --> 00:36.440]  I think it's kind of creepy.
[00:36.440 --> 00:37.440]  Why?
[00:37.440 --> 00:40.920]  Well, it's an invasion of privacy.
[00:40.920 --> 00:44.880]  But TSA says it's taken your privacy into consideration.
[00:44.880 --> 00:48.560]  Even though the screener can see your body when you go through the machines, your face
[00:48.560 --> 00:52.400]  is shaded, so the screener cannot identify you.
[00:52.400 --> 00:56.440]  And because of that, the screener doesn't have to be the same sex as the passenger
[00:56.440 --> 00:58.240]  being screened.
[00:58.240 --> 01:02.160]  Once the image is taken, TSA says it cannot be stored.
[01:02.160 --> 01:05.720]  One screener is in a room out of the public's view.
[01:05.720 --> 01:06.720]  I have an issue with that.
[01:06.720 --> 01:09.480]  I think safety has to come first and foremost.
[01:09.480 --> 01:13.120]  TSA says the machines give off harmless millimeter waves.
[01:13.120 --> 01:17.000]  They can detect concealed weapons, bombs and other explosives.
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.160]  Past surprise government inspections have shown, screeners have repeatedly failed to
[01:21.160 --> 01:23.240]  catch explosives and weapons.
[01:23.240 --> 01:27.160]  I have no problem with them doing what they need to do to keep it safe over flying.
[01:27.160 --> 01:29.000]  I have no problems with it.
[01:29.000 --> 01:34.040]  TSA says the machines will be used as a secondary screening at some airports and at random at
[01:34.040 --> 01:35.320]  DFW.
[01:35.320 --> 01:37.480]  The machines are optional.
[01:37.480 --> 01:40.160]  Passengers can still choose a traditional pat-down.
[01:40.160 --> 01:43.120]  And TSA says most choose the machines.
[01:43.120 --> 01:48.680]  I think it's less invasive than somebody having to touch you to pat you down, so I would
[01:48.680 --> 01:50.600]  prefer it.
[01:50.600 --> 01:53.920]  And again, TSA says these machines are safe to your body.
[01:53.920 --> 01:58.800]  In fact, they say it gives off a lot less energy than even your cell phone.
[01:58.800 --> 02:04.000]  Live at DFW International Airport, Jack Fink.
[02:04.000 --> 02:08.760]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:08.760 --> 02:09.760]  You want answers?
[02:09.760 --> 02:11.920]  Well, so does he.
[02:11.920 --> 02:16.080]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:16.080 --> 02:20.560]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:20.560 --> 02:24.520]  The criminals that run the world government are going for broke.
[02:24.520 --> 02:28.600]  They're wildly destroying all liberty.
[02:28.600 --> 02:30.520]  Police checkpoints federally funded.
[02:30.520 --> 02:37.680]  Suck blood out of your veins on dark highways in the middle of the night at warrantless checkpoints.
[02:37.680 --> 02:43.400]  Body scanners that give you a total 360 view of your naked body, your genitalia, and all
[02:43.400 --> 02:44.400]  details.
[02:44.400 --> 02:47.720]  They make the sick joke of, don't worry, we blur your face out and they lie and say
[02:47.720 --> 02:48.880]  they don't save it.
[02:48.880 --> 02:52.360]  I have the company data, they record it all onto hard drives.
[02:52.360 --> 02:53.720]  This is the humiliation.
[02:53.720 --> 02:55.800]  I have stacks of news.
[02:55.800 --> 02:56.800]  We are changed.
[02:56.800 --> 02:58.760]  People being arrested, detained.
[02:58.760 --> 03:02.200]  People being grabbed in downtown Denver for handing out DVDs.
[03:02.200 --> 03:06.920]  The police say you're not allowed to hand these DVDs out wall-to-wall insanity, ladies
[03:06.920 --> 03:08.000]  and gentlemen.
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.000]  We have a huge broadcast lined up for you on this Friday edition.
[03:12.000 --> 03:15.280]  Dennis Kasenich, you've introduced 35 articles of impeachment.
[03:15.280 --> 03:18.720]  We'll be joining us in T-minus 30 minutes.
[03:18.720 --> 03:23.480]  We've got Keith Byrne fighting the EU expansion into Ireland.
[03:23.480 --> 03:25.440]  Looks like it's neck and neck.
[03:25.440 --> 03:27.280]  The news is saying it may have failed.
[03:27.280 --> 03:31.600]  We won't know for the next four or five hours, but by the end of the show, we should know
[03:31.600 --> 03:33.480]  we have four hours ahead of us.
[03:33.480 --> 03:37.480]  Barbara Lowe Fisher, president of the National Vaccine Information Center, will come on and
[03:37.480 --> 03:41.280]  talk about the basics and how the government admits that mercury caused brain damage in
[03:41.280 --> 03:43.040]  millions of American children.
[03:43.040 --> 03:47.560]  Meanwhile, the media viciously attacks Charlie Sheen saying he's crazy that he's trying
[03:47.560 --> 03:52.680]  to get injunctions against his wife, his ex-wife, vaccinating his children.
[03:52.680 --> 03:56.840]  Ralph Nader scheduled to be joining us, Green Party presidential candidate.
[03:56.840 --> 04:01.920]  We've got Michael Reagan calling for the murder, the firing squad death of Mark Dice for calling
[04:01.920 --> 04:05.280]  for giving 9-11 truth DVDs to troops.
[04:05.280 --> 04:07.720]  And then we have David Edwards popping in as well.
[04:07.720 --> 04:13.520]  This is the ultra-massive Friday broadcast that we have lined up for you with tons of
[04:13.520 --> 04:21.200]  incredibly important news like this headline, Central Bank Body, Warns of Great Depression.
[04:21.200 --> 04:26.000]  Families face 1,000-pound bedroom tax before councils give permission for people to extend
[04:26.000 --> 04:31.320]  their homes under new rules, under greenhouse gas emission, lack of sun activity could bring
[04:31.320 --> 04:36.320]  new ice age reported, airport scanners to go on the streets as well.
[04:36.320 --> 04:37.760]  It is all coming up.
[04:37.760 --> 04:41.720]  Very important broadcast lined up for you on this Friday edition.
[04:41.720 --> 04:46.240]  Again, Dennis Kosinich to be joining us coming up, very important show, call everybody you
[04:46.240 --> 04:53.600]  know, tell them to tune in now, stay with us, we'll be right back.
[04:53.600 --> 04:55.560]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[04:55.560 --> 05:00.040]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest
[05:00.040 --> 05:01.600]  hour there is hope.
[05:01.600 --> 05:04.640]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[05:04.640 --> 05:08.880]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New
[05:08.880 --> 05:10.400]  World Order master plan.
[05:10.400 --> 05:14.640]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[05:14.640 --> 05:20.000]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.TV is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[05:20.000 --> 05:22.880]  PrisonPlanet.TV is a vault of forbidden information.
[05:22.880 --> 05:27.440]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly
[05:27.440 --> 05:30.480]  to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[05:30.480 --> 05:34.640]  Thousands of special video reports from tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this
[05:34.640 --> 05:36.080]  online video library.
[05:36.080 --> 05:40.920]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews and so much more.
[05:40.920 --> 05:47.000]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free, join PrisonPlanet.TV, burn the info bombs
[05:47.000 --> 05:54.040]  to disc, put them on the file sharing networks, bring down the New World Order, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[05:54.040 --> 05:58.160]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that
[05:58.160 --> 06:02.160]  you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking
[06:02.160 --> 06:03.160]  the water?
[06:03.160 --> 06:07.040]  Yes, because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into
[06:07.040 --> 06:08.040]  the skin.
[06:08.040 --> 06:12.680]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to
[06:12.680 --> 06:18.200]  reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold,
[06:18.200 --> 06:19.520]  algae and fungus.
[06:19.520 --> 06:24.400]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever
[06:24.400 --> 06:25.400]  comes first.
[06:25.400 --> 06:29.560]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[06:29.560 --> 06:31.640]  iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[06:31.640 --> 06:32.640]  What about you?
[06:32.640 --> 06:37.960]  You can order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with
[06:37.960 --> 06:39.120]  free shipping.

[06:53.520 --> 06:58.160]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[06:58.160 --> 07:02.920]  Chlorine fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[07:02.920 --> 07:04.640]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[07:04.640 --> 07:08.280]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calben Pure Soaps?

[07:54.720 --> 08:01.280]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the Information War continues.
[08:01.280 --> 08:11.040]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[08:11.040 --> 08:16.080]  From Canada to the United States, we are changed as being arrested.
[08:16.080 --> 08:22.760]  We're handing out DVDs on street corners, we're talking.
[08:22.760 --> 08:29.000]  That's just incredible, tyranny everywhere is exploding, growing out of control, lawlessness
[08:29.000 --> 08:30.000]  by government.
[08:30.000 --> 08:35.160]  I mean this morning I was reminded by the London Guardian article where John McCain publicly
[08:35.160 --> 08:40.760]  went to England, met at the Rothschild's house, raised hundreds of thousands of dollars illegally.
[08:40.760 --> 08:44.600]  The law is clear, it's illegal to take money from foreigners, much less have fundraisers
[08:44.600 --> 08:46.760]  on foreign soils.
[08:46.760 --> 08:49.960]  And McCain just said, so what, there's nothing you can do about it.
[08:49.960 --> 08:56.160]  I mean that's what I mean, the government is just insane, it just does whatever it wants.
[08:56.160 --> 09:02.080]  And then at the start of the show I played this newscast out of Dallas where they just
[09:02.080 --> 09:09.480]  calmly announce that airports all over the country now, they are going to send just through
[09:09.480 --> 09:14.840]  domestic flights as well, 214 of these scanners, every major airport.
[09:14.840 --> 09:17.720]  And that's it, I'm not going to go through one, I'm not.
[09:17.720 --> 09:22.960]  I mean I told you about this five years ago, they put them in four airports and it shows
[09:22.960 --> 09:25.040]  a total color image.
[09:25.040 --> 09:30.480]  I mean you are naked and then they have that psychological warfare piece, you can analyze
[09:30.480 --> 09:34.960]  each part of it about don't worry, we brought your face out, don't worry, we're not recording
[09:34.960 --> 09:35.960]  it.
[09:35.960 --> 09:40.320]  When they are recording it onto a hard drive and they're going to march you through and
[09:40.320 --> 09:44.200]  then they have all these sheepish like people sitting there saying, oh I like it, oh it's
[09:44.200 --> 09:47.440]  good, oh safety comes first.
[09:47.440 --> 09:51.800]  And the metal detectors would quote pick up guns or weapons when we know the terrorism
[09:51.800 --> 09:55.800]  is being staged by the government, the vast majority of it.
[09:55.800 --> 09:58.520]  And then now they are announcing that in the US and England they are going to have mobile
[09:58.520 --> 10:03.120]  scan trucks and feed citizens on the side of the street through them and they are announcing
[10:03.120 --> 10:06.480]  they are going to have metal detectors in shopping malls and random and they are taking
[10:06.480 --> 10:11.840]  blood at random checkpoints, it is driving me completely insane.
[10:11.840 --> 10:15.780]  I want to play this little two minute news clip again and I want to stop it and comment
[10:15.780 --> 10:17.520]  as we play it, here it is.
[10:17.520 --> 10:21.920]  DFW airport is about to take a much closer look at its passengers, a new body scan screener
[10:21.920 --> 10:26.840]  is being put into place but some say what it sees is a little too revealing.
[10:26.840 --> 10:28.160]  Stop there.
[10:28.160 --> 10:35.880]  Some say what it sees is a little too revealing, a color image of your genitalia of a woman's
[10:35.880 --> 10:41.640]  breast, this is a strip search and the federal government says they want to replace all the
[10:41.640 --> 10:46.840]  major scanners to where you will not just have the metal detector or run your bags and
[10:46.840 --> 10:52.960]  now all of us, when they are done within two years according to their timetable, they will
[10:52.960 --> 10:57.520]  make everyone go through this, that is it, I am not flying.
[10:57.520 --> 11:01.960]  Meanwhile all of the commercial aviation, all the private aviation they just drive up,
[11:01.960 --> 11:04.760]  pull in, walk in, get on their plane and go.
[11:04.760 --> 11:10.240]  This is training you how to be a slave and then they say don't worry we blur your face
[11:10.240 --> 11:16.280]  out and it shows it on the news and you can see they even show you the video, the scan
[11:16.280 --> 11:22.440]  and you can, they have to blur out the genitals and it says don't worry only the staff sees
[11:22.440 --> 11:26.960]  it and then it says they don't know who is in the scanner when you walk into it right
[11:26.960 --> 11:29.480]  in front of them and it shows it on the news.
[11:29.480 --> 11:33.440]  That is kind of like when HEB started putting thumb scanners in at the self checkout lanes
[11:33.440 --> 11:38.200]  in some stores and then got rid of service checkout all together so you had to go through
[11:38.200 --> 11:41.960]  it and they said don't worry it is not your thumb print that they matched with the drivers
[11:41.960 --> 11:45.600]  license here in the state under federal rules.
[11:45.600 --> 11:49.680]  They said no, no it is a group of numbers, well that is a sick joke, yes they reconfigure
[11:49.680 --> 11:55.440]  the numbers for the image, a digital photo is zeros and ones but you configure it and
[11:55.440 --> 12:00.600]  put it back together and it is a photo, I mean it is just endless lying.
[12:00.600 --> 12:03.920]  This is a government that tells you it is the law you have got to take vaccines when
[12:03.920 --> 12:08.360]  there is no law, it is gone rogue, back to the tape.
[12:08.360 --> 12:12.120]  Jack Fink live for us tonight at the airport to give us a closer look at this, Jack.
[12:12.120 --> 12:16.720]  Doug they started using two body scanning machines here at the international terminal
[12:16.720 --> 12:21.360]  two days ago, they will officially be launched on Friday and while some passengers raised
[12:21.360 --> 12:26.080]  privacy concerns, most we spoke with say safety first.
[12:26.080 --> 12:30.720]  Melanie Martin flies about twice a month, she is not comfortable with the new body scanning
[12:30.720 --> 12:34.640]  machines installed at DFW airport and others across the country.
[12:34.640 --> 12:39.880]  The devices reveal your body's intimate parts, we have shaded these pictures off TSA's website.
[12:39.880 --> 12:46.280]  I think it is kind of creepy, well it is an invasion of privacy.
[12:46.280 --> 12:51.000]  But TSA says it has taken your privacy into consideration, even though the screener can
[12:51.000 --> 12:56.040]  see your body when you go through the machines, your face is shaded so the screener cannot
[12:56.040 --> 12:57.040]  identify you.
[12:57.040 --> 13:02.960]  Alright stop that, that is another sick joke as if there wasn't a weapon or something as
[13:02.960 --> 13:05.120]  if they wouldn't identify who you were.
[13:05.120 --> 13:09.000]  Just a ball face line like saying we don't take your thumb print, we just scan your thumb
[13:09.000 --> 13:10.480]  print.
[13:10.480 --> 13:17.920]  And then saying we cover your face and then right there on the news you can see the genitals.
[13:17.920 --> 13:22.400]  You can see a male and a female and you can see their genitals.
[13:22.400 --> 13:28.640]  Now when they first announced this five years ago in 2002 and put them in in four airports
[13:28.640 --> 13:32.760]  I remember CBS News and I went and pulled up the company's big defense contractors put
[13:32.760 --> 13:38.000]  out several different models and it showed it and they bragged that it is an even clearer
[13:38.000 --> 13:44.200]  image than the human eye normally picks up because it even shows all of your pores.
[13:44.200 --> 13:49.400]  And it said that they record it and then now for fitting stores they basically put the
[13:49.400 --> 13:54.380]  same system in so you get the ultimate suit fit and a bunch of different high end clothing
[13:54.380 --> 13:57.080]  lines you go in and it biometrically scans you.
[13:57.080 --> 14:02.240]  That's how detailed it is, they use it to give you a super fit with a suit because it
[14:02.240 --> 14:07.160]  fits your body and then the computer calculates how to do it.
[14:07.160 --> 14:09.640]  It is just so incredible.
[14:09.640 --> 14:16.040]  Do you understand ladies and gentlemen that they say in army documents that are in my
[14:16.040 --> 14:19.520]  book to send the tyranny that we've covered here that they are going to do this by degree
[14:19.520 --> 14:22.880]  to prepare you for invasive procedures?
[14:22.880 --> 14:25.480]  This is to prepare you for medical procedures.
[14:25.480 --> 14:28.000]  If they can invasively scan your neck and body.
[14:28.000 --> 14:32.520]  If they can invasively take your blood on the side of a moonlit street.
[14:32.520 --> 14:37.120]  If they can invasively try to tell you got to take vaccines they can do it all.
[14:37.120 --> 14:39.000]  That's what national healthcare is about.
[14:39.000 --> 14:40.120]  Back to the tape.
[14:40.120 --> 14:44.440]  And because of that the screener doesn't have to be the same sex as the passenger being
[14:44.440 --> 14:45.960]  screened.
[14:45.960 --> 14:49.880]  Once the image is taken TSA says it cannot be stored.
[14:49.880 --> 14:53.440]  One screener is in a room out of the public's view.
[14:53.440 --> 14:54.440]  Have an issue with that.
[14:54.440 --> 14:57.200]  I think safety has to come first and foremost.
[14:57.200 --> 15:00.800]  TSA says the machines give off harmless millimetre waves.
[15:00.800 --> 15:02.240]  Let's stop there.
[15:02.240 --> 15:08.840]  See they make it about safety and about oh it's harmless millimetre waves.
[15:08.840 --> 15:15.560]  And by the way it is a sonar slash radar but they describe the technology as a sonar.
[15:15.560 --> 15:20.280]  Because it's meant to go through solid things and it's hitting your body.
[15:20.280 --> 15:29.800]  Now understand it goes around you and gives them a 360 biometric scan and they are saving
[15:29.800 --> 15:34.440]  it and it is attached to your name.
[15:34.440 --> 15:38.520]  Now they're talking about putting them in schools next and on the streets.
[15:38.520 --> 15:39.760]  In fact I have articles today.
[15:39.760 --> 15:47.800]  In fact let me just get to the article here because I am mentioning this now.
[15:47.800 --> 15:52.400]  Listen to this.
[15:52.400 --> 15:56.040]  Scanners that see through clothing installed in U.S. airports AFP.
[15:56.040 --> 15:58.320]  Here's one out of CNN AP.
[15:58.320 --> 16:00.840]  Airport style scanners on London streets.
[16:00.840 --> 16:04.040]  Now two years ago in London they have mobile trucks.
[16:04.040 --> 16:08.680]  Last time I saw there were 22 of them and they randomly drive around and they randomly
[16:08.680 --> 16:13.320]  make people just they order you and the people submit and they walk through it and they go
[16:13.320 --> 16:16.120]  into a truck and then it scans them inside.
[16:16.120 --> 16:22.320]  They also said that they make clubgoers now all over England and Germany take a DNA swab
[16:22.320 --> 16:25.800]  of their cheek tissue as authorization to go in a bar.
[16:25.800 --> 16:28.040]  If you say no they tackle you and arrest you.
[16:28.040 --> 16:30.480]  That was in the news one month ago.
[16:30.480 --> 16:32.840]  I'm not kidding we can play the clip.
[16:32.840 --> 16:33.840]  We did.
[16:33.840 --> 16:36.280]  I mean it's just off the charts.
[16:36.280 --> 16:39.720]  This is worse than anything 1984 ever thought of.
[16:39.720 --> 16:45.120]  Hundreds of school districts that we know of have cameras in the bathrooms in the stalls
[16:45.120 --> 16:51.240]  videotaping urination and defecation in school showers.
[16:51.240 --> 16:58.760]  That was in Tennessee and they wire it in from Sacramento Tennessee to Dallas Texas
[16:58.760 --> 17:01.800]  into the police department live time.
[17:01.800 --> 17:05.560]  Your children are prisoners.
[17:05.560 --> 17:08.560]  And that guy sitting there saying I have a problem with that I have a problem people
[17:08.560 --> 17:14.720]  not liking this safety comes first you cowardly wimps do you understand the greatest danger
[17:14.720 --> 17:19.600]  to you is the government throughout history is elites because they can use government
[17:19.600 --> 17:24.120]  to take everything you've got to use you as slaves to use you as military cannon fodder
[17:24.120 --> 17:25.560]  with a draft.

[34:04.120 --> 34:10.240]  i just get more and more respect for uh... dennis kasinich i have to say really is the
[34:10.240 --> 34:15.480]  leader now against this tyranny i have to say that ron paul isn't even as strong as
[34:15.480 --> 34:20.200]  he is when it comes to speaking out ron paul did sign on to the 35 articles of impeachment
[34:20.200 --> 34:25.760]  we salute him for that i'm about to tell you dennis kasinich uh... in this very dark climate
[34:25.760 --> 34:32.220]  has courage that no one else in congress i i i not seen it and i sure you need our prayers
[34:32.220 --> 34:39.380]  because this is a very wicked group and uh... the mainstream media tried to ignore it
[34:39.380 --> 34:46.760]  and others on uh... cnn and ms mbc with some of the other shows like countdown on government
[34:46.760 --> 34:51.600]  have been calling for impeachment but not really talking about the fact uh... that dennice
[34:51.600 --> 34:55.500]  kasinich is pushing for it the congressman joint is very busy he's with us for the next
[34:55.500 --> 35:01.780]  25 minutes for the rest of this hour. You can go to casinich.house.gov and read the
[35:01.780 --> 35:06.500]  35 articles of impeachment. You can also go to infowars.com and see the YouTube clips
[35:06.500 --> 35:13.020]  of his speech he gave a few days ago. Dennis Kasinich, I just absolutely want to praise
[35:13.020 --> 35:18.740]  what you're doing for the Republic. It's just you really are doing something, as you
[35:18.740 --> 35:20.740]  know, that takes a lot of courage.
[35:20.740 --> 35:28.740]  Alex, thank you very much for those kind words and for the honor of being on your show. Your
[35:28.740 --> 35:35.340]  listeners are particularly attuned to the erosion of democratic principles, and what
[35:35.340 --> 35:45.300]  led me to finally introduce these articles was the totality of the offenses and the ongoing
[35:45.300 --> 35:52.820]  violations and the possibility that we could even end up in another war. Based on lies,
[35:52.820 --> 35:58.740]  we are losing our country to lies, to erosion of our civil liberties. We've moved into direction
[35:58.740 --> 36:04.500]  as profoundly anti-democratic and Congress has a constitutional responsibility to put
[36:04.500 --> 36:08.900]  a check on an executive abuse of power. That's what these articles of impeachment will do,
[36:08.900 --> 36:16.500]  and they not only set an historic benchmark and an historic record for future generations,
[36:16.500 --> 36:23.020]  but they also send a message to whoever would be the next president that such usurpations
[36:23.020 --> 36:25.660]  and abuses are not going to be tolerated.
[36:25.660 --> 36:29.620]  Congressman, just to break down for those that don't know the process, you basically
[36:29.620 --> 36:34.260]  have brought charges to the equivalent of the grand jury, which is the House, which
[36:34.260 --> 36:39.060]  will then decide whether or not to indict, then it will go to a trial in the Senate.
[36:39.060 --> 36:44.500]  If Richard Nixon, who did one-one-hundredth literally of what Bush and his crime syndicate
[36:44.500 --> 36:49.900]  have done, and if Clinton deserved for what he did to be indicted in the House, there
[36:49.900 --> 36:55.940]  is no doubt that George Bush and his group of cronies must be indicted just to get our
[36:55.940 --> 36:59.540]  country's name back and to let the police and military know that what they've been
[36:59.540 --> 37:04.100]  ordered to do is illegal, because now we see the president set for all forms of tyranny.
[37:04.100 --> 37:08.020]  Can you walk through how important it is that people get behind this process and how do
[37:08.020 --> 37:13.140]  we, you know, A, what has Bush and his crime syndicate done, B, how do we help you get
[37:13.140 --> 37:14.140]  this done?
[37:14.140 --> 37:19.220]  Alex, the first thing that I want to say after listening to the way that you provided a capsule
[37:19.220 --> 37:28.100]  summary is that you yourself are someone who needs to be appreciated for your understanding
[37:28.100 --> 37:32.780]  what's happening, your willingness to communicate it to people, so I thank you for understanding.
[37:32.780 --> 37:37.620]  I thank you for understanding the scope of the challenge that we face and for outlining
[37:37.620 --> 37:43.860]  it in a way that you have, because essentially we, you know, these charges have to be presented
[37:43.860 --> 37:49.860]  to the Judiciary Committee, which then will hopefully hold a hearing and send it to the
[37:49.860 --> 37:55.700]  House with a report, which then will be voted on, and if the president is impeached in the
[37:55.700 --> 38:03.020]  House, he would go on trial in the Senate, this whole, this is a moment where we have
[38:03.020 --> 38:06.220]  the opportunity to reclaim our government and to reclaim all that's good and right in
[38:06.220 --> 38:11.260]  America and what we stand for, not only with respect to each other, but what we stand for
[38:11.260 --> 38:12.820]  in the world.
[38:12.820 --> 38:13.980]  I love this country.
[38:13.980 --> 38:20.460]  I, you know, I get chills when I watch the flag pass by in a parade.
[38:20.460 --> 38:27.420]  I feel, I wear an American flag because, and it has a blind person gave it to me because
[38:27.420 --> 38:31.420]  it has USA and Braille on it, so then even a blind person would know I'm wearing this
[38:31.420 --> 38:33.140]  flag because I love this country.
[38:33.140 --> 38:34.140]  I love the flag.
[38:34.140 --> 38:40.420]  I love what America has historically stood for, but I see our country as being destroyed
[38:40.420 --> 38:44.220]  by people who don't want to obey the law and just want to be a law to themselves.
[38:44.220 --> 38:50.060]  That's why there's got to be an accounting for the loss of lives of our soldiers that
[38:50.060 --> 38:54.740]  have been, uh, were sent there on a, on a mission that was not based in truth.
[38:54.740 --> 38:57.100]  There's got to be an accounting for the injuries to them.
[38:57.100 --> 39:01.780]  There's got to be an accounting for the innocent Iraqis who have died for the, for the huge
[39:01.780 --> 39:06.260]  amounts of money that were borrowing to be able to keep this war going and, and every
[39:06.260 --> 39:13.020]  other president who has been held to, uh, uh, a measure of accounting, uh, their offenses
[39:13.020 --> 39:18.460]  pale in comparison to the offenses of this president.
[39:18.460 --> 39:23.220]  And you've put out 35, let's just cover five or six of what you think are most important.
[39:23.220 --> 39:27.700]  And they're all very important, uh, of those 35 Congressman Dennis Kosenich.
[39:27.700 --> 39:33.180]  Well, you know, the, the ones that deal with Iraq really talk about manufacturing a false
[39:33.180 --> 39:34.180]  case for war.
[39:34.180 --> 39:38.260]  And then it's been just demonstrated over and over that all the representations that
[39:38.260 --> 39:42.780]  were made, uh, that Iraq, uh, supposedly had weapons of mass destruction posing a
[39:42.780 --> 39:48.700]  minimum threat, uh, that, uh, it had something to do with 9-11 or okay to roll 9-11.
[39:48.700 --> 39:52.940]  All of those, uh, attempts to try to get the American people to believe that and an organized
[39:52.940 --> 39:53.940]  effort was made.
[39:53.940 --> 39:59.580]  In fact, we're based in falsehood, uh, and it was so, uh, a war of aggression was begun
[39:59.580 --> 40:01.900]  against a country that did not attack us.
[40:01.900 --> 40:10.460]  Uh, and such a war is in violation of international law, uh, the, uh, which puts George Bush with
[40:10.460 --> 40:13.620]  in the reach of an international tribunal.
[40:13.620 --> 40:15.820]  This is why Congress needs to become involved.
[40:15.820 --> 40:22.300]  We cannot let other governments or other jurisdictions, uh, do our work for us.
[40:22.300 --> 40:28.420]  We need to, uh, look at the record and recognize that law has been violated and it has to be
[40:28.420 --> 40:31.180]  come a matter of a systematic public examination.
[40:31.180 --> 40:35.100]  When that happens, uh, you know, it said that you shall know the truth and the truth shall
[40:35.100 --> 40:36.100]  set you free.
[40:36.100 --> 40:41.580]  Because this country will begin to be freed from the grip of fear, which has, uh, which
[40:41.580 --> 40:48.660]  has been placed its clammy hold on us, uh, since 9-11 and the capitalization on the
[40:48.660 --> 40:53.460]  events of 9-11 for political purposes will end and, and we'll merit, we'll get our
[40:53.460 --> 40:54.460]  country back.
[40:54.460 --> 40:58.420]  This is about getting our country back, uh, reestablishing the rule of law and getting
[40:58.420 --> 41:04.260]  back our civil liberties, putting aside, you know, enforcing posse comatotus, uh, making
[41:04.260 --> 41:08.460]  sure there's no more torture or wiretapping or eavesdropping or, uh, you know, any of
[41:08.460 --> 41:13.500]  the things that, that are un-American, we're, we're going to, we're going to reclaim America
[41:13.500 --> 41:21.420]  and the impeachment resolution and the 35 articles are intent on doing just that.
[41:21.420 --> 41:24.220]  You've got quite a few co-sponsors just a few days into this.
[41:24.220 --> 41:26.180]  Tell us about that process, sir.
[41:26.180 --> 41:32.700]  Uh, well, the bill just went to judiciary yesterday and Congress adjourned for the week
[41:32.700 --> 41:34.460]  early in the day.
[41:34.460 --> 41:40.380]  Uh, we have four, uh, now three co-sponsors, uh, Congressman Wexler, Congresswoman Lee
[41:40.380 --> 41:42.620]  and Woolsey have co-sponsored.
[41:42.620 --> 41:48.780]  Uh, next week will be an opportunity for people to, uh, become co-sponsors.
[41:48.780 --> 41:54.220]  I would ask your listeners to please call their member of Congress and indicate your
[41:54.220 --> 41:55.780]  support for co-sponsorship.
[41:55.780 --> 42:00.140]  I would ask everyone who's listening, please read the articles of impeachment because the
[42:00.140 --> 42:05.460]  more conversant you are, the more fluent you'll be in talking to congressional staff about
[42:05.460 --> 42:08.220]  the urgency of members of Congress getting onto it.
[42:08.220 --> 42:14.620]  Um, my, uh, information is available on my website at Cassinage.us and certainly, uh,
[42:14.620 --> 42:19.220]  you know, if you check there, there's a hundred thousand places on the web by now that, uh,
[42:19.220 --> 42:23.300]  have information about the articles of impeachment, uh, you know, this is a time for us all to
[42:23.300 --> 42:24.300]  get involved.
[42:24.300 --> 42:28.940]  And so what you can do is, is learn about it, read about it, be conversant in it, contact
[42:28.940 --> 42:32.780]  a member of Congress, make sure that they've read it, ask them to support the resolution
[42:32.780 --> 42:37.340]  HR, uh, 12, 58, and then demand hearings.
[42:37.340 --> 42:38.260]  We have to have hearings.
[42:38.260 --> 42:40.860]  We cannot avert our eyes.
[42:40.860 --> 42:41.860]  So that's the key.
[42:41.860 --> 42:44.540]  The, the hearings will open up this evidence.
[42:44.540 --> 42:48.060]  It will become a televised spectacle, which is what we need.
[42:48.060 --> 42:50.620]  So more people learn about the crimes that have committed.
[42:50.620 --> 42:53.980]  And by the way, you had to stop at 35, uh, there were, I mean, what about a million debt
[42:53.980 --> 42:54.980]  Iraqis?
[42:54.980 --> 42:58.580]  Uh, what about, I mean, when you add it all together, frankly, I've got to say that yours
[42:58.580 --> 43:03.380]  is very measured and I would call even conservative as bad as the 35 are.
[43:03.380 --> 43:08.260]  Now I had read that 25 congressmen and women had quote signed onto it.
[43:08.260 --> 43:12.580]  I'd seen a media blurb is it, I guess that means they have publicly said they're supporting
[43:12.580 --> 43:13.580]  it.
[43:13.580 --> 43:14.580]  They just haven't had it.
[43:14.580 --> 43:15.580]  They may be confused about that.
[43:15.580 --> 43:17.980]  That may have related to the Cheney impeachment.
[43:17.980 --> 43:23.500]  I'm not aware that we have 25 co-sponsors, uh, but I will find that out immediately.
[43:23.500 --> 43:30.660]  All right, um, how soon until we'll find out if we're able to force hearings in the house?
[43:30.660 --> 43:32.940]  Well, here's, here's what I've said.
[43:32.940 --> 43:38.180]  Uh, we, we need to start making calls and all next week we need to be calling members
[43:38.180 --> 43:41.380]  of Congress and encouraging them to sign on.
[43:41.380 --> 43:46.740]  Uh, and, um, and also encouraging them to ask for hearings and judiciary.
[43:46.740 --> 43:50.820]  Um, I'm going to be meeting with the chairman of judiciary and also with members of the
[43:50.820 --> 43:55.420]  judiciary committee, providing them with backup documentation for the charges that are in
[43:55.420 --> 43:56.420]  the articles.
[43:56.420 --> 44:01.300]  Uh, I'm, uh, you know, and I feel it's, it's important that they have, uh, some, a little
[44:01.300 --> 44:04.900]  bit of time to be able to read them and digest them and make a decision.
[44:04.900 --> 44:09.940]  I've made it clear though that in the face of statements by the house leadership that
[44:09.940 --> 44:15.460]  this thing is dead on arrival, that unlike other resolutions where in fact, if you introduce
[44:15.460 --> 44:18.660]  a bill and it goes to committee, they don't hold hearings, it is dead.
[44:18.660 --> 44:22.500]  A privilege resolution is one that you can bring back again.
[44:22.500 --> 44:26.420]  So I've made it very clear if there's no action within 30 days, I will come back with
[44:26.420 --> 44:34.020]  60 articles of impeachment and, uh, and, and stand on the house floor for eight hours and
[44:34.020 --> 44:35.020]  read them.
[44:35.020 --> 44:39.100]  And so that the nation can once again hear what's going on.
[44:39.100 --> 44:44.980]  Congressman, I could never imagine reading these 35 articles of impeachment a more provable
[44:44.980 --> 44:45.980]  case.
[44:45.980 --> 44:51.380]  And their own memos, their own executive orders, their own Pentagon battle plans, this, uh,
[44:51.380 --> 44:55.780]  the fake newscast, uh, paying for fake media agents of influence.
[44:55.780 --> 45:00.740]  I mean, I mean, here's an example this morning, I ran across a story, I had forgotten about
[45:00.740 --> 45:05.300]  from a few months ago, London Guardian, Associated Press where John McCain went to a fundraiser
[45:05.300 --> 45:09.260]  in London, raised hundreds of thousands of dollars, admitted it was illegal.
[45:09.260 --> 45:12.140]  There's no debating each count as a felony.
[45:12.140 --> 45:13.460]  And then he just said, so what?
[45:13.460 --> 45:18.180]  I mean, that's just another example of the government on every level is just going completely
[45:18.180 --> 45:19.180]  lawless.
[45:19.180 --> 45:20.180]  It, it, what has happened?
[45:20.180 --> 45:27.300]  It's like a, well, well, let me tell you, um, people who are, are us expatriates, people
[45:27.300 --> 45:34.500]  who live in, in another country, but our citizens of the United States, uh, can contribute to,
[45:34.500 --> 45:37.100]  to the campaign of a federal candidate.
[45:37.100 --> 45:40.460]  But they admitted these weren't us citizens or that's a whole different deal.
[45:40.460 --> 45:41.460]  I mean, I don't know.
[45:41.460 --> 45:42.460]  I had this first I've heard of it.
[45:42.460 --> 45:44.580]  That was the Rothschild meeting as well.
[45:44.580 --> 45:51.100]  Well, look, but you know, my, my concern here is that in upholding the rule of law, uh,
[45:51.100 --> 45:57.140]  we are basically correcting, you know, correcting the direction of our ship of state.
[45:57.140 --> 45:58.140]  That's it.
[45:58.140 --> 45:59.140]  We're complicit.
[45:59.140 --> 46:02.660]  If we don't do what you're doing right now, we have a moral obligation to get behind Dennis
[46:02.660 --> 46:03.660]  Kosenich.
[46:03.660 --> 46:04.660]  Yeah.
[46:04.660 --> 46:06.460]  Alex, I appreciate that.
[46:06.460 --> 46:11.980]  I also want to say that I've just had my office check the, uh, impeachment resolution
[46:11.980 --> 46:17.540]  with respect to, uh, vice president Cheney at 27 coast parties, our bill that we've
[46:17.540 --> 46:22.300]  just introduced, uh, and, and people had to put their name in as they, you know, we're
[46:22.300 --> 46:25.180]  leaving for the break for the weekend.
[46:25.180 --> 46:26.180]  We have three.
[46:26.180 --> 46:31.780]  So that it, it'll, it'll, by next week, I'm confident as people here from their constituents
[46:31.780 --> 46:36.780]  around the country that they'll come back and sign on congressman with trillions missing
[46:36.780 --> 46:39.520]  from the Pentagon, three trillions spent on the war.
[46:39.520 --> 46:43.740]  You haven't heard the clip that we played it earlier of Michael Reagan saying that 9-11
[46:43.740 --> 46:47.700]  truth, there should be taken out summer early and killed without trials.
[46:47.700 --> 46:49.900]  And he said, I will pay for the bullets.
[46:49.900 --> 46:53.780]  And I've seen similar rhetoric from these neocons and talk radio.
[46:53.780 --> 46:57.860]  I, it seems like they're cornered now and that they're more dangerous than ever.
[46:57.860 --> 46:58.860]  Can you speak?
[46:58.860 --> 46:59.860]  I mean, are you getting a sense?
[46:59.860 --> 47:03.660]  Cause you're up there in the catbird seat in Congress that, that things are coming to
[47:03.660 --> 47:06.940]  a head right now.
[47:06.940 --> 47:11.780]  We, you know, our country, just these events over the last seven years have really divided
[47:11.780 --> 47:15.500]  our country and, and we need to find a way to unite.
[47:15.500 --> 47:18.140]  We can unite in truth.
[47:18.140 --> 47:23.500]  We, we need to understand it, that there's just deep concern that people have an all
[47:23.500 --> 47:29.300]  sides that, that there's, that things are unfair and that people are being unfairly
[47:29.300 --> 47:30.300]  accused.
[47:30.300 --> 47:32.220]  Well, that's why we need hearings to bring it all out.
[47:32.220 --> 47:36.300]  Well, you've been championing the, the, the fact that we have the E-Pay report that the
[47:36.300 --> 47:38.260]  dust was deadly and they covered it up.
[47:38.260 --> 47:42.500]  Now they've had to basically admit a lot of that in scientific studies and, and we're
[47:42.500 --> 47:46.300]  called traders for even saying we should give healthcare to the firemen and police.
[47:46.300 --> 47:50.500]  Well, I, I felt very, you're correct in what you just said, but I will take, I will say
[47:50.500 --> 47:58.620]  this, that I feel strongly enough about bringing out the truth about 9-11 that I brought forth
[47:58.620 --> 48:11.900]  to articles that, that for the first time make 9-11 truth a, a, a, a serious discussion
[48:11.900 --> 48:19.660]  in the articles of impeachment, the, the obstruction of, of the investigation into the attacks
[48:19.660 --> 48:28.340]  in 9-11, the, the fact that the, the administration repeatedly ignored and failed to respond to
[48:28.340 --> 48:31.540]  the high, high level intelligence warnings of a planned attack.
[48:31.540 --> 48:33.940]  You've got them there and they were caught lying to Congress on that.
[48:33.940 --> 48:34.940]  Yeah.
[48:34.940 --> 48:44.540]  And, and the fact that the 9-11, those who responded to 9-11 were not told of the, of
[48:44.540 --> 48:46.540]  the dangers to their health and so forth.
[48:46.540 --> 48:50.140]  And so they were encouraged to go forward without providing adequate protection.
[48:50.140 --> 48:54.380]  And that's an article as well, in danger in health and 9-11, uh, first responders.
[48:54.380 --> 48:55.380]  So Congressmen shifting gears.
[48:55.380 --> 48:56.380]  We don't have a lot of time.
[48:56.380 --> 49:00.820]  We've just got the next segment, um, I know you're a confident, you know, manly guy.
[49:00.820 --> 49:05.220]  You don't like to talk about issues like this, but we know that we've had a lot of suspicious
[49:05.220 --> 49:10.260]  planes blowing up, people committing suicide, people falling downstairs who exposed different
[49:10.260 --> 49:15.240]  crime syndicates during our, in contra during this administration, during other administrations.
[49:15.240 --> 49:20.340]  Are you worried about your safety bringing out impeachment now against Cheney and, uh,
[49:20.340 --> 49:21.340]  Bush?
[49:21.340 --> 49:23.340]  I mean, can you speak to that?
[49:23.340 --> 49:31.060]  Um, you know, in the 23rd Psalm, uh, which is always worth reading, it says, though I
[49:31.060 --> 49:35.500]  walk through the valley of shadows, I will fear no evil for thou out with me.
[49:35.500 --> 49:42.380]  And I think we have to have confidence that, uh, that there is a spiritual dimension in
[49:42.380 --> 49:47.860]  life, which is always, you know, that we always move in.
[49:47.860 --> 49:53.300]  And when we do that, it's like whatever, whatever the, whatever the will of, of, of
[49:53.300 --> 49:59.020]  that, of that spiritual dimension is some call it God and I, and I'll call it God, whatever
[49:59.020 --> 50:04.900]  the will of God is, uh, is something that whatever will be, will be, but I don't worry
[50:04.900 --> 50:05.900]  about that.
[50:05.900 --> 50:07.220]  I never, I never worry about it.
[50:07.220 --> 50:10.180]  Congressman, I'm getting from you that you're committed, that you're just going to do your
[50:10.180 --> 50:13.580]  duty and the consequences belong to God.
[50:13.580 --> 50:23.260]  I think, I think we are here on this planet to, to do, uh, the work of God, that we,
[50:23.260 --> 50:29.580]  uh, and, and you know, now some people will, will, uh, talk about it in a spiritual sense.
[50:29.580 --> 50:32.180]  Others will, will say we're aligning with a higher purpose.
[50:32.180 --> 50:37.180]  Well, however you want to describe it, I think that, uh, we're here for a higher purpose.
[50:37.180 --> 50:42.660]  And so I try to live that and, uh, each of us has an opportunity to do it every day in
[50:42.660 --> 50:44.140]  the work that we do.
[50:44.140 --> 50:46.340]  Congressman, final segment with you straight ahead.
[50:46.340 --> 50:48.720]  We'll be back in about two minutes, ladies and gentlemen.
[50:48.720 --> 50:50.220]  This is history you're seeing.
[50:50.220 --> 50:54.300]  We've all got to pray for the congressman.
[50:54.300 --> 50:58.780]  Now from the makers of loose change, the most downloading film in internet history comes

[51:11.780 --> 51:14.580]  family members receive answers to their questions.
[51:14.580 --> 51:18.580]  And the true perpetrators of the surrender's crime are brought to justice.
[51:18.580 --> 51:23.500]  Loose change final cut is the ultimate 9 11 expose from hijackers being trained at us

[51:45.340 --> 51:48.220]  We're in a no holds bar information war.

[51:52.660 --> 52:14.780]  to big brother.
[52:14.780 --> 52:19.980]  This is a story actually a horrible story, a horrible historic story that took place
[52:19.980 --> 52:23.340]  with the pilgrims in the 1600s.
[52:23.340 --> 52:28.460]  The pilgrim leader William Bradford governor of Plymouth Colony called the father of American
[52:28.460 --> 52:31.560]  history told of and wrote of this story.
[52:31.560 --> 52:37.580]  He called it a horrible case of and we just won't yet tell you what it was a horrible
[52:37.580 --> 52:39.260]  case of.
[52:39.260 --> 52:45.020]  It was a crime committed by a young 16 year old boy in the colony by the name of Thomas
[52:45.020 --> 52:51.220]  Gregor a crime in the area of shall we say of a sexual nature, maybe we should say of
[52:51.220 --> 52:53.140]  a sexual perversion.
[52:53.140 --> 52:56.700]  He was caught convicted, even admitted guilt.
[52:56.700 --> 53:00.500]  What were they to do as a Christian civil body politic?
[53:00.500 --> 53:06.180]  What they did compared to what so called Christians today would do shows that what is called and
[53:06.180 --> 53:13.020]  pawned off as Christianity today was not what existed in that Christian colony of yesterday's
[53:13.020 --> 53:14.580]  1600s.
[53:14.580 --> 53:19.020]  What was young Thomas Gregor caught doing and what did those real Christian men in their
[53:19.020 --> 53:20.900]  society do about it?
[53:20.900 --> 53:24.180]  Find out by going to another untold story dot com.
[53:24.180 --> 53:27.140]  Learn of this horrible story and what was done about it.
[53:27.140 --> 53:30.700]  Most today would call what was done horrible, but they did it.
[53:30.700 --> 54:00.260]  Learn about it at another untold story dot com.
[54:00.260 --> 54:10.740]  All right, final segment with Congressman Cassinage.
[54:10.740 --> 54:11.740]  We salute him.
[54:11.740 --> 54:13.060]  We want to support his impeachment.
[54:13.060 --> 54:18.140]  Go learn the 35 articles, learn what is documented and what's happening.
[54:18.140 --> 54:22.020]  Just amazing the courage he's got and we were talking during the break just about how he's
[54:22.020 --> 54:24.940]  committed and that's just the end of it.
[54:24.940 --> 54:26.100]  We got about four minutes.
[54:26.100 --> 54:29.740]  Anything else you think is key that people should know, Congressman?
[54:29.740 --> 54:35.180]  But we're in a period where we need to reclaim our country and that we cannot put on hold,
[54:35.180 --> 54:38.260]  domestic law, international law, or constitutional law.
[54:38.260 --> 54:48.260]  There's no logical explanation for this impeachment being put on the table or put off the table.
[54:48.260 --> 54:54.220]  This impeachment process can be very good for our country and recalibrating our moral
[54:54.220 --> 54:58.460]  compass and helping to educate people as to what's going on and bringing about a consciousness
[54:58.460 --> 55:02.900]  shift that aligns us again with our basic principles by which this country was founded.
[55:02.900 --> 55:08.540]  We got to break this Washington mindset of insularity and unaccountability and reach
[55:08.540 --> 55:12.420]  out and reconnect with each other and with people all over the globe.
[55:12.420 --> 55:14.180]  This isn't about Democrat or Republican.
[55:14.180 --> 55:16.180]  It's not about right or left.
[55:16.180 --> 55:19.340]  It's about the truth and the truth doesn't have a political party.
[55:19.340 --> 55:23.380]  Well, Congressman, I totally agree with you on that.
[55:23.380 --> 55:27.220]  We were talking in the break about how they're acting like cornered rats, but that shows
[55:27.220 --> 55:32.340]  that we're really having success here, and when you talk about how this is the right
[55:32.340 --> 55:35.460]  thing to do, it is a fight between good and evil.
[55:35.460 --> 55:40.100]  There's no doubt true evil has reared its head in our time and our country, and I don't
[55:40.100 --> 55:42.900]  see how anybody out there would not get off the fence.
[55:42.900 --> 55:46.820]  What are some of the basic things that Average Joe's can do?
[55:46.820 --> 55:49.900]  I mean, go when their congressman or woman is in the local district.
[55:49.900 --> 55:55.980]  First, it is important that everyone reads these articles because we need to be conversant
[55:55.980 --> 55:58.300]  in what the issues are.
[55:58.300 --> 56:04.740]  The next thing is, call your member of Congress and ask that member to read the articles,
[56:04.740 --> 56:12.820]  and after doing so, to sign on to House Resolution 1258, and then encourage also the hearings
[56:12.820 --> 56:13.820]  and judiciary.
[56:13.820 --> 56:16.900]  Now, I have said, people have said, well, this thing, they're not going to hold any
[56:16.900 --> 56:17.900]  hearings.
[56:17.900 --> 56:18.900]  This thing is a dead deal.
[56:18.900 --> 56:23.820]  I have said that I'll be back with 60 articles in a month if they don't hold any hearings.
[56:23.820 --> 56:24.820]  We're not going to let this go.
[56:24.820 --> 56:26.260]  This is not going to go away.
[56:26.260 --> 56:33.580]  We're going to continue in our efforts to save this country from this calamity of deception
[56:33.580 --> 56:40.820]  and of anti-democratic behavior and destruction of the law, international law, as well as
[56:40.820 --> 56:43.340]  domestic, and the destruction of our Constitution.
[56:43.340 --> 56:44.500]  I believe in America.
[56:44.500 --> 56:45.500]  I love this country.
[56:45.500 --> 56:46.500]  I do, too.
[56:46.500 --> 56:50.900]  Congressman, in closing, I would liken this to a new Declaration of Independence, and
[56:50.900 --> 56:53.740]  people will rally to it and push it and expose it.
[56:53.740 --> 56:57.940]  If we can get hearings, they will be brought down, and we can get our name back.
[56:57.940 --> 56:59.340]  Do you agree with that statement?
[56:59.340 --> 57:01.820]  I think that's right.
[57:01.820 --> 57:02.820]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[57:02.820 --> 57:03.820]  Thank you, Congressman.
[57:03.820 --> 57:04.820]  Well, give out.
[57:04.820 --> 57:05.820]  You've got several websites.
[57:05.820 --> 57:06.820]  Which one should we visit?
[57:06.820 --> 57:07.820]  Cassinich.us.
[57:07.820 --> 57:08.820]  Cassinich.us.
[57:08.820 --> 57:11.660]  And go in there.
[57:11.660 --> 57:12.980]  That's my website.
[57:12.980 --> 57:16.460]  If you sign up, we'll keep you posted on events as they unfold.
[57:16.460 --> 57:17.700]  I know you're a very busy man.
[57:17.700 --> 57:19.580]  We've got about a minute left with you.
[57:19.580 --> 57:22.380]  Can we get you back on in the next few weeks to give us a...
[57:22.380 --> 57:23.380]  Yeah, we should try.
[57:23.380 --> 57:28.820]  It would be good if we talked in another week or so so we could bring you up to date.
[57:28.820 --> 57:30.900]  Maybe we should do it just before the 4th of July.
[57:30.900 --> 57:31.900]  That would be great.
[57:31.900 --> 57:32.900]  All right.
[57:32.900 --> 57:36.380]  Congressman, thank you so much, and again, we salute you.
[57:36.380 --> 57:40.140]  We're all behind you and right beside you, and say hi to your wife and great staff for
[57:40.140 --> 57:41.140]  us.
[57:41.140 --> 57:42.140]  So thanks for coming on.
[57:42.140 --> 57:43.140]  Thanks to you and your listeners, Alex.
[57:43.140 --> 57:44.140]  Thank you.
[57:44.140 --> 57:45.140]  Wow.
[57:45.140 --> 57:46.140]  There goes Congressman Dennis Cassinich.
[57:46.140 --> 57:49.340]  And folks, I have criticized him on a few issues, but the guy is genuine.
[57:49.340 --> 57:51.620]  The guy is real.
[57:51.620 --> 57:53.460]  He is such a great speaker.
[57:53.460 --> 57:58.860]  He speaks from the heart and from history, and the enemy is completely out of control
[57:58.860 --> 57:59.860]  right now.
[57:59.860 --> 58:01.020]  They are very dangerous.
[58:01.020 --> 58:02.700]  They know they've wrecked this country.
[58:02.700 --> 58:04.340]  They know they've tripled the size of government.
[58:04.340 --> 58:07.460]  They know they've committed all these crimes, and they're going for broke.
[58:07.460 --> 58:10.180]  And I don't know what new events they're going to stage or what.
[58:10.180 --> 58:12.380]  We've got to keep them off balance.
[58:12.380 --> 58:15.660]  We've got to continue to expose the left-right paradigm.
[58:15.660 --> 58:23.460]  I mean, just the economic crises is looming depression, mainstream news.

[58:34.180 --> 58:45.860]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.

[58:50.380 --> 58:51.900]  hour there is hope.
[58:51.900 --> 58:54.980]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[58:54.980 --> 58:59.180]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New

[1:00:08.300 --> 1:00:16.180]  From Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:16.180 --> 1:00:21.700]  This isn't a game to me, my life was on the line, my family's on the line, I put my family
[1:00:21.700 --> 1:00:27.260]  in harm's way to do what I'm doing here.
[1:00:27.260 --> 1:00:33.020]  Tears my heart out to know the type of evil we face and to know it's legion, it's growing.
[1:00:33.020 --> 1:00:38.260]  We are entering the darkest time in this country's history, there is no debating that fact.
[1:00:38.260 --> 1:00:41.740]  The tyranny is enveloping the planet, but I couldn't turn down that opportunity last
[1:00:41.740 --> 1:00:46.700]  week to bullhorn and literally shut down their internal conference at Bilderberg, it turned
[1:00:46.700 --> 1:00:50.020]  out that, I just can't believe we did it.
[1:00:50.020 --> 1:00:52.620]  But with the opportunity, I couldn't turn it down because I'm committed, it's like
[1:00:52.620 --> 1:00:58.380]  I'm in a stream, I'm in a river, going downstream, I don't even control myself anymore.
[1:00:58.380 --> 1:01:02.460]  I am just completely controlled by the mission, I am completely turned over to it.
[1:01:02.460 --> 1:01:07.700]  I am not in fear of the New World Order, I am so sad that our fellow Americans, many
[1:01:07.700 --> 1:01:11.940]  of them don't know what's happening, I mean, I study this countless hours a day and I can
[1:01:11.940 --> 1:01:18.140]  barely grasp the full magnitude of their scientific evil, the ultimate evil, I mean, they say
[1:01:18.140 --> 1:01:25.900]  that on the Isle of Patmos, John the Revelator, marveled at it and when you truly fight evil
[1:01:25.900 --> 1:01:29.620]  ladies and gentlemen, you heard Dennis Kucinich talking about it, spiritual battle, I've never
[1:01:29.620 --> 1:01:35.420]  heard him talk like that because he knows, I can tell, he has gone over the threshold.
[1:01:35.420 --> 1:01:39.180]  Just like when I bullhorned Billerberg the first time, this time, the only part of the
[1:01:39.180 --> 1:01:45.020]  conference building was the only part of the hotel, Billerberg, where they were meeting
[1:01:45.020 --> 1:01:50.940]  in Chantilly at the Marriott, was the part that was only 25 yards from the road where
[1:01:50.940 --> 1:01:55.220]  I could bullhorn them and it shut down their meeting, Richard and Haas came out, I passed
[1:01:55.220 --> 1:01:59.100]  another threshold there, I mean, I could see the danger, I knew that doing that would put
[1:01:59.100 --> 1:02:02.780]  me into a whole other level on their radar, Rothkopf, the head of the Kissinger Group,
[1:02:02.780 --> 1:02:06.500]  the head of the Carnegie Endowment, wrote in his book, attacking me, I mean, they know
[1:02:06.500 --> 1:02:12.260]  who I am and that's why I'm begging you to support us, I'm begging you to spread the
[1:02:12.260 --> 1:02:18.340]  word about this show because we are sacrificing everything to bring you this, we are, and
[1:02:18.340 --> 1:02:22.460]  I am blessed to be doing this, I am blessed to be at the tip of the spear, you know, you
[1:02:22.460 --> 1:02:27.140]  heard Dennis Kucinich on air and off air saying, he knows that we are right on the
[1:02:27.140 --> 1:02:32.140]  tip of the spear, that they are upset by us, we are hurting them, you are hurting them,
[1:02:32.140 --> 1:02:36.300]  we are giving this evil a fight, ladies and gentlemen, we are not going quietly into the
[1:02:36.300 --> 1:02:42.460]  night, we are resisting and I just pray that our Heavenly Father put up a hedge of protection
[1:02:42.460 --> 1:02:47.300]  around all patriots and lovers of liberty, I pray that people will feel the spirit of
[1:02:47.300 --> 1:02:51.420]  love and goodness come into their hearts, I pray that police and military that have
[1:02:51.420 --> 1:02:56.460]  served evil and who know they're in the wrong and still have a small conscience left who
[1:02:56.460 --> 1:03:01.260]  still have some soul left, who still have one little pink area of their black hearts
[1:03:01.260 --> 1:03:06.300]  to let that pink loving area of their heart grow and take their whole heart and soul and
[1:03:06.300 --> 1:03:13.820]  gut back over and that they would join us in this epic struggle against tyranny.
[1:03:13.820 --> 1:03:17.660]  It is so important.
[1:03:17.660 --> 1:03:22.580]  We are at the crossroads, this is the historical crossroads, the elite want to wall society
[1:03:22.580 --> 1:03:28.180]  off into a eugenics, technocracy of death and disease and war and lies and destruction
[1:03:28.180 --> 1:03:32.500]  and anguish and pain where the innocent and the beautiful and the honorable are crushed
[1:03:32.500 --> 1:03:36.780]  and ripped and destroyed.
[1:03:36.780 --> 1:03:40.340]  There is so much, so many things I want to tell you, so many things I've discovered
[1:03:40.340 --> 1:03:46.060]  and understand and so many complex thought processes and algorithms that the mind God
[1:03:46.060 --> 1:03:50.980]  gave me is able to understand that I can't with human words articulate.
[1:03:50.980 --> 1:03:55.340]  There's so much I want you to know, even those of you that are awake, so much that I'm learning
[1:03:55.340 --> 1:03:57.580]  every day.
[1:03:57.580 --> 1:04:01.060]  There are huge developments right now with the Lisbon Treaty.
[1:04:01.060 --> 1:04:05.820]  It now appears that it may go down by narrow defeat, we'll learn in the next few hours.
[1:04:05.820 --> 1:04:10.580]  The news reporting this morning and this afternoon is that it's probably going down a defeat,
[1:04:10.580 --> 1:04:14.940]  but EU dictators may ram through Lisbon Treaty despite iris rejection.
[1:04:14.940 --> 1:04:18.460]  It's like England was never allowed to have a vote on it and they brought in part of it
[1:04:18.460 --> 1:04:22.820]  under a judicial court a treaty.
[1:04:22.820 --> 1:04:28.940]  No Watson will join us from the UK along with We Are Change Ireland Keith Byrne on the other
[1:04:28.940 --> 1:04:32.380]  side of this quick break.
[1:04:32.380 --> 1:04:40.020]  This is it, you're seeing history, you're seeing ragtag group of patriots standing up against
[1:04:40.020 --> 1:04:45.540]  the greatest of mass level of evil ever seen on this planet.
[1:04:45.540 --> 1:04:50.820]  We go with the torch of truth and the light of God in our eyes trusting in him.
[1:04:50.820 --> 1:04:55.060]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[1:04:55.060 --> 1:04:59.620]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:04:59.620 --> 1:05:02.140]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[1:05:02.140 --> 1:05:05.620]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[1:05:05.620 --> 1:05:08.740]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[1:05:08.740 --> 1:05:14.660]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[1:05:14.660 --> 1:05:19.140]  of humanity is at hand.
[1:05:19.140 --> 1:05:24.620]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:05:24.620 --> 1:05:28.460]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:05:28.460 --> 1:05:31.140]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[1:05:31.140 --> 1:05:34.300]  Most people have no idea they're not after money, they have all the money they need.
[1:05:34.300 --> 1:05:36.500]  They're after power, that's their after easy.

[1:05:47.940 --> 1:05:49.940]  You have been warned.
[1:05:49.940 --> 1:05:51.500]  Wake up Protestant America.
[1:05:51.500 --> 1:05:55.220]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[1:05:55.220 --> 1:05:59.500]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics and Protestant denominations will form one
[1:05:59.500 --> 1:06:01.220]  huge political voting block.
[1:06:01.220 --> 1:06:05.260]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[1:06:05.260 --> 1:06:09.060]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom, liberty
[1:06:09.060 --> 1:06:10.260]  of conscience.
[1:06:10.260 --> 1:06:13.700]  History and the Bible proved to them that these two systems, church and state, must be
[1:06:13.700 --> 1:06:14.700]  kept separate.
[1:06:14.700 --> 1:06:18.860]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[1:06:18.860 --> 1:06:21.420]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[1:06:21.420 --> 1:06:25.900]  From history we saw that when church and state united, known as papal Rome, religious intolerance
[1:06:25.900 --> 1:06:26.900]  resulted.
[1:06:26.900 --> 1:06:30.620]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[1:06:30.620 --> 1:06:33.380]  America and papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[1:06:33.380 --> 1:06:35.860]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late.
[1:06:35.860 --> 1:06:37.700]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling.
[1:06:37.700 --> 1:06:39.460]  Jesus is coming soon.
[1:06:39.460 --> 1:06:46.700]  Our free materials call 888-211-1715 or write the Bible says Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee
[1:06:46.700 --> 1:06:49.700]  37771.
[1:06:49.700 --> 1:06:52.620]  Are you concerned about cholesterol, blood pressure?
[1:06:52.620 --> 1:06:54.660]  Are you experiencing chest pain?
[1:06:54.660 --> 1:06:59.180]  Are you looking for a more natural method to help improve your health issues?
[1:06:59.180 --> 1:07:02.780]  My husband has had lots of blood pressure problems.
[1:07:02.780 --> 1:07:08.060]  It would just be really high that doctor had worked with him and he'd give him some medication
[1:07:08.060 --> 1:07:12.700]  for a little while, it would maybe work, and then it wouldn't.
[1:07:12.700 --> 1:07:16.740]  He was going back and forth and my husband's not the time that he wants to go to the doctor
[1:07:16.740 --> 1:07:17.740]  anyway.
[1:07:17.740 --> 1:07:19.540]  He'll wait till he is in major problems.
[1:07:19.540 --> 1:07:25.780]  So a friend gave us a bottle of Cotavite and he started on it and within a very short
[1:07:25.780 --> 1:07:30.740]  time, I'm going to say two weeks at the most, it was just leveling out and as long as he's
[1:07:30.740 --> 1:07:33.340]  been on these, it has literally saved his life.

[1:07:45.740 --> 1:08:00.180]  He's the T-Rex of Political Talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:00.180 --> 1:08:01.180]  Welcome back.
[1:08:01.180 --> 1:08:04.540]  I'm Keith Byrne, we are Change Ireland.
[1:08:04.540 --> 1:08:10.580]  The polls showed that we're going to win the Lisbon Treaty a few months ago, but we are
[1:08:10.580 --> 1:08:12.180]  Change Ireland energized.
[1:08:12.180 --> 1:08:18.980]  They made a film using a lot of in-game and with number one in Ireland, Google, millions
[1:08:18.980 --> 1:08:25.560]  saw it, millions and they are credited even by mainstream press is helping mobilize people
[1:08:25.560 --> 1:08:26.560]  against it.
[1:08:26.560 --> 1:08:30.180]  It looks like it's going down into feet as of right now.
[1:08:30.180 --> 1:08:34.780]  A lot of people on the streets, I've talked to Keith and others when we are Change Ireland
[1:08:34.780 --> 1:08:38.940]  and they're saying 10 to 1, taxi cab drivers say they're asking all their fares, they're
[1:08:38.940 --> 1:08:43.220]  saying 10 to 1 against it, so there's definitely election fraud, but it looks like that the
[1:08:43.220 --> 1:08:48.340]  landslide against it is so huge that they may not be able to cheat and say that the
[1:08:48.340 --> 1:08:49.340]  treaty went through.
[1:08:49.340 --> 1:08:50.340]  Now, let's explain.
[1:08:50.340 --> 1:08:55.120]  In 50 years, the European Union, which they didn't announce that it existed until 2000,
[1:08:55.120 --> 1:08:59.380]  but they had the 50th anniversary in 2007.
[1:08:59.380 --> 1:09:03.060]  They have only allowed three referendums.
[1:09:03.060 --> 1:09:08.140]  The one in France and the other there in Europe failed.
[1:09:08.140 --> 1:09:11.660]  That was in 2005, big defeat.
[1:09:11.660 --> 1:09:14.500]  They're already under the euro, but that was to get rid of any national sovereignty and
[1:09:14.500 --> 1:09:18.300]  any power their government's had and make the EU president basically a dictator and that's
[1:09:18.300 --> 1:09:20.380]  mainstream news saying that.
[1:09:20.380 --> 1:09:25.820]  It's in paper that they run everything, total regulation, total taxes, greenhouse taxes,
[1:09:25.820 --> 1:09:30.660]  total micromanagement, hellish control, attacking free speech, everything.
[1:09:30.660 --> 1:09:36.820]  Now, they've been propagandizing for about four years in Ireland in the buildup to this
[1:09:36.820 --> 1:09:40.620]  and they're now reporting, I want to go to Paul Watson first, then we'll go to Ireland,
[1:09:40.620 --> 1:09:45.100]  but I want to go to the UK first because the UK wasn't allowed to vote on this either.
[1:09:45.100 --> 1:09:49.460]  They're trying to bring it in there by stealth so we can understand what's being announced.
[1:09:49.460 --> 1:09:53.820]  Incredible headline, amazing analysis up on PrisonPlanet.com, get it out to everyone
[1:09:53.820 --> 1:09:54.820]  right now.
[1:09:54.820 --> 1:10:00.100]  The EU dictators may ram through Lisbon treaty, despite Irish rejection, EU risk losing all
[1:10:00.100 --> 1:10:06.060]  legitimacy by circumventing its own laws in pursuit of federal super state and we go to
[1:10:06.060 --> 1:10:13.300]  Paul Watson from the UK, literally from the hometown of Robin Hood there in Sheffield to
[1:10:13.300 --> 1:10:20.540]  tell us what's happening as we fight this modern day Prince John type activity.
[1:10:20.540 --> 1:10:22.020]  Paul Watson, tell us what's happening.
[1:10:22.020 --> 1:10:23.020]  Hello.
[1:10:23.020 --> 1:10:24.020]  All right.
[1:10:24.020 --> 1:10:33.940]  Yeah, basically what's happening is that the EU, as it's always been about, are continuing
[1:10:33.940 --> 1:10:40.340]  to pursue this federal super state no matter what referendum or treaty gets rejected by
[1:10:40.340 --> 1:10:48.900]  its own member states because under EU laws, even if one of its member states rejects a
[1:10:48.900 --> 1:10:57.020]  treaty or a constitution as is happened today, the EU under its own laws is mandate to scrap
[1:10:57.020 --> 1:10:58.020]  the bill.
[1:10:58.020 --> 1:11:06.140]  But in 2001, when the Irish voted on me and rejected it, which was similar to Lisbon treaty,
[1:11:06.140 --> 1:11:09.940]  they simply had another referendum a year later until they got the result that they
[1:11:09.940 --> 1:11:10.940]  wanted.
[1:11:10.940 --> 1:11:16.100]  But this time it appears that if they're even going to go a step further, it's been that
[1:11:16.100 --> 1:11:22.180]  they simply ignore the Irish rejection of the Lisbon treaty today and push ahead and
[1:11:22.180 --> 1:11:24.020]  run through with it anyway.
[1:11:24.020 --> 1:11:28.620]  Paul, go through the details of why they're beginning to make noises that this is the
[1:11:28.620 --> 1:11:30.380]  case to tell your story.
[1:11:30.380 --> 1:11:36.540]  Well, the BBC's reporting close to British government is expected to continue ratifying
[1:11:36.540 --> 1:11:39.820]  the EU treaty despite rejection by Irish voters.
[1:11:39.820 --> 1:11:47.180]  Now, I remember it was the Labour Party under Blair in their own manifesto that promised
[1:11:47.180 --> 1:11:55.620]  that any EU constitution or EU treaty, which would mean further integration with the EU,
[1:11:55.620 --> 1:11:58.300]  would be put to a referendum in the UK.
[1:11:58.300 --> 1:11:59.740]  It never happened.
[1:11:59.740 --> 1:12:01.100]  Brown never followed up on it.
[1:12:01.100 --> 1:12:02.620]  He was a complete liar.
[1:12:02.620 --> 1:12:08.740]  So they're saying that it's going to go through in the British Parliament anyway.
[1:12:08.740 --> 1:12:15.980]  And the Guardian's reporting today that Gordon Brown actually phoned the French president
[1:12:15.980 --> 1:12:21.620]  Nicolas Sarkozy, quote, to assure him that the British ratification would continue.
[1:12:21.620 --> 1:12:26.940]  Yeah, under EU laws, it's supposed to completely annul the treaty if one member state rejects
[1:12:26.940 --> 1:12:33.620]  it, but Sarkozy and Brown are going to go ahead with it anyway, as is the president
[1:12:33.620 --> 1:12:39.740]  Barroso, who, quote, urged member states to continue ratifying the treaty insisting it
[1:12:39.740 --> 1:12:43.300]  was alive and we should now try to find a solution.
[1:12:43.300 --> 1:12:49.700]  So they're saying, we're not going to kill it, we're going to push it through anyway.
[1:12:49.700 --> 1:12:55.620]  Showing that they are complete and total tyrants, Paul, shifting gears, we're going to go to
[1:12:55.620 --> 1:12:56.620]  Ireland.
[1:12:56.620 --> 1:12:57.620]  We are changing.
[1:12:57.620 --> 1:12:58.620]  Keep you on with us, Paul.
[1:12:58.620 --> 1:13:02.660]  One of the main leaders of the Tories resigned saying that he's discovered, and we bled the
[1:13:02.660 --> 1:13:08.540]  audio, that they're trying to set up a dictatorship, that it is martial law, that it is a control
[1:13:08.540 --> 1:13:09.540]  grid.
[1:13:09.540 --> 1:13:10.540]  This is not a stunt.
[1:13:10.540 --> 1:13:12.540]  He, I mean, it's incredible.
[1:13:12.540 --> 1:13:15.300]  He's saying the government's tyrannical, they're taking over.
[1:13:15.300 --> 1:13:19.020]  He's resigning one of the top positions in the parliament, one of the main leaders of
[1:13:19.020 --> 1:13:20.020]  the Tories.
[1:13:20.020 --> 1:13:22.020]  Tell us about this development.
[1:13:22.020 --> 1:13:30.700]  Yeah, that's David, who were the 42 day law, who were detained people without trial for
[1:13:30.700 --> 1:13:38.700]  42 days, was passed by Gordon Brown and the Labour Party yesterday after a bunch of backroom
[1:13:38.700 --> 1:13:41.540]  deals that they managed to pull off.
[1:13:41.540 --> 1:13:47.340]  And David, who was on the Conservative Party, just said, that's it, I'm resigning as a moral
[1:13:47.340 --> 1:13:49.660]  reaction to what went down.
[1:13:49.660 --> 1:13:55.740]  And so now there's a national media demonization against David because he's going to try and
[1:13:55.740 --> 1:14:01.860]  rerun for his seat, so there's a big media demonization campaign against him, because
[1:14:01.860 --> 1:14:08.180]  what he's talking about is not just the fact that detaining people without trial for 42
[1:14:08.180 --> 1:14:13.860]  days is a complete abomination, abomination to any notion of a free society, but he's
[1:14:13.860 --> 1:14:20.860]  also talking about the control factor of what's going on in the UK with the surveillance cameras.
[1:14:20.860 --> 1:14:25.700]  He's talking about the fact that we live in a highly regulated society and it's becoming
[1:14:25.700 --> 1:14:27.700]  increasingly insane.
[1:14:27.700 --> 1:14:32.740]  And for his own moral reasons, he chose to stand down as a form of protest, so obviously
[1:14:32.740 --> 1:14:38.340]  the mass media is now demonizing him in lockstep with Gordon Brown.
[1:14:38.340 --> 1:14:40.620]  Let me ask you another issue.
[1:14:40.620 --> 1:14:44.780]  You know, a bunch of We Are Changed people have been arrested, detained for filming,
[1:14:44.780 --> 1:14:51.260]  for handing out videos on major street corners in Denver, in Canada, in the US and Canada.
[1:14:51.260 --> 1:14:54.700]  And now, and this is huge news, Mark Dice is coming up later.
[1:14:54.700 --> 1:14:58.860]  Mark Dice has the idea of mailing the troops, and we know the neocons have programs where
[1:14:58.860 --> 1:15:04.180]  they mail pro-war books, pro-propaganda, they have these advertisement sites where you go
[1:15:04.180 --> 1:15:08.780]  and then they give you a member of the military to send packages to.
[1:15:08.780 --> 1:15:15.580]  And Mark Dice said, this is on Monday, he said, let's send documents, let's send Operation
[1:15:15.580 --> 1:15:20.820]  Northwoods, Operation Ajax, let's send Terror Storm videos to the troops, which is this
[1:15:20.820 --> 1:15:28.620]  first amendment right, and the most amazing clip, in fact, queue it up, John, right where
[1:15:28.620 --> 1:15:32.820]  he talks about, we need to take Mark Dice and these other 9-11 truthers out and kill
[1:15:32.820 --> 1:15:35.020]  them, no trial, and that he'll pay for the bullets.
[1:15:35.020 --> 1:15:37.780]  He is calling for our murder.
[1:15:37.780 --> 1:15:42.700]  Michael Savage, the fake conservative top-beatnik of the 60s, always an operative, is calling
[1:15:42.700 --> 1:15:44.860]  for us to be put in forced labor camps.
[1:15:44.860 --> 1:15:50.620]  I mean, the fact that they're doing this means they are really serious about coming after
[1:15:50.620 --> 1:15:55.980]  us and doesn't scare me, it means we're hurting them and showing that they're really destroying
[1:15:55.980 --> 1:15:57.780]  this country and they're not real conservatives.
[1:15:57.780 --> 1:15:59.780]  But Paul, your take on that.
[1:15:59.780 --> 1:16:07.580]  Well, I mean, it all stems from that 2006 White House memo, I mean, that before all
[1:16:07.580 --> 1:16:13.740]  the white al-Qaeda propaganda that started coming out at the end of last year and early
[1:16:13.740 --> 1:16:20.100]  this year, you had a 2006 White House memo that said, the conspiracy theories promulgated
[1:16:20.100 --> 1:16:28.540]  by the internet and DVDs are a wellspring of terrorist influence with the effects and
[1:16:28.540 --> 1:16:29.540]  paraphrases.
[1:16:29.540 --> 1:16:33.260]  And now they've had the congressional hearings where they showed architects and engineers
[1:16:33.260 --> 1:16:38.060]  for 9-11 truth just covering the basic math and physics, saying they're with al-Qaeda
[1:16:38.060 --> 1:16:44.500]  with no evidence, total slander, and that's right, Michael Reagan's been invited to the
[1:16:44.500 --> 1:16:48.340]  White House publicly to get his talking points.
[1:16:48.340 --> 1:16:52.140]  Others understand, we are now being attacked, we've had them come out and say 9-11 truthers
[1:16:52.140 --> 1:16:57.180]  are behind bombings and attacks that we should be tased, taken to, quote, secret prisons,
[1:16:57.180 --> 1:16:58.820]  MSNBC, others.
[1:16:58.820 --> 1:17:03.740]  I mean, Paul, they would, we are now the main focus of the criminals that run the government.
[1:17:03.740 --> 1:17:07.420]  I hope the listeners realize this, I mean, I keep pointing this out because we need support
[1:17:07.420 --> 1:17:08.900]  to continue here.
[1:17:08.900 --> 1:17:17.300]  That's right, they're turning the anti-terror apparatus around the face of us and the media
[1:17:17.300 --> 1:17:21.340]  has just gone crazy in identifying anything as terrorism.
[1:17:21.340 --> 1:17:30.220]  They even had Fox News, when Obama gave his victory speech the other week, Fox News said
[1:17:30.220 --> 1:17:35.420]  that the fifth bump he did with his wife was the terrorist Hezbollah signal.
[1:17:35.420 --> 1:17:41.100]  So, I mean, that's the level of insanity that they can get away with claiming.
[1:17:41.100 --> 1:17:45.540]  And then, yeah, they claim that 9-11 truth is a dangerous possibility.
[1:17:45.540 --> 1:17:50.220]  Well, they make women who aren't even Muslim who wear a scarf now, Dunkin' Donuts take
[1:17:50.220 --> 1:17:53.820]  TV ads off because wearing a scarf shows you're al-Qaeda.
[1:17:53.820 --> 1:17:58.340]  This is an insane paranoia when they are al-Qaeda, the government carried out the attacks.
[1:17:58.340 --> 1:18:06.020]  Let's go to Keith Byrne, we are Change Ireland, give us a report.
[1:18:06.020 --> 1:18:07.860]  Is it officially being defeated?
[1:18:07.860 --> 1:18:09.660]  They're saying they believe it's been defeated.
[1:18:09.660 --> 1:18:13.580]  The Lisbon Treaty to bring you into the EU tyranny has been defeated.
[1:18:13.580 --> 1:18:15.580]  What's your take on what's happening from Ireland?
[1:18:15.580 --> 1:18:19.260]  Well, Alex, the way we look at it is it's a no-vo here.
[1:18:19.260 --> 1:18:24.100]  The actual government have said unofficially that they have been defeated in the Lisbon
[1:18:24.100 --> 1:18:25.100]  Treaty.
[1:18:25.100 --> 1:18:29.460]  And I think it was the minister of, I think it was the minister of justice who said that
[1:18:29.460 --> 1:18:32.860]  it was disappointing and that they didn't get the result that they wanted.
[1:18:32.860 --> 1:18:34.980]  So it actually is a victory here right now.
[1:18:34.980 --> 1:18:38.660]  And I think it's time that we can celebrate a little, but they are going to come back
[1:18:38.660 --> 1:18:40.340]  again somehow, we believe.
[1:18:40.340 --> 1:18:42.140]  Well, another great victory.
[1:18:42.140 --> 1:18:45.780]  This is three defeats in a row because you've still got, now they're going to try to put
[1:18:45.780 --> 1:18:48.220]  an electronic voting which we're doing in England.
[1:18:48.220 --> 1:18:51.300]  But again, showing their dictator, showing their tyrants.
[1:18:51.300 --> 1:18:53.380]  Are you excited right now, Mr. Byrne?
[1:18:53.380 --> 1:18:57.260]  Oh, yeah, Alex, we're all excited here and I've brought with our members of the Change
[1:18:57.260 --> 1:19:01.300]  Chapter here in Ireland and, you know, we can all speak to you and give our personal stories
[1:19:01.300 --> 1:19:04.300]  of the journey throughout the campaign.
[1:19:04.300 --> 1:19:05.800]  Absolutely.
[1:19:05.800 --> 1:19:06.800]  This is very exciting.
[1:19:06.800 --> 1:19:09.300]  What's the spirit out there on the streets in Ireland?
[1:19:09.300 --> 1:19:13.900]  Well, I'm not too sure, like I was in town and I was pretty excited myself.
[1:19:13.900 --> 1:19:19.540]  I didn't really get to go out to where the ballots were being counted, but I went up
[1:19:19.540 --> 1:19:23.420]  to another campaign in office and the atmosphere there was electric.
[1:19:23.420 --> 1:19:24.420]  People were very excited.
[1:19:24.420 --> 1:19:28.340]  Well, I'm going to continue the discussion for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[1:19:28.340 --> 1:19:30.820]  We're streaming live right now and on my internet streams.
[1:19:30.820 --> 1:19:31.820]  This is too important.
[1:19:31.820 --> 1:19:35.140]  I've got about six other guests coming up, Ralph Nader included.
[1:19:35.140 --> 1:19:37.100]  So Paul Watson, stay there.

[1:19:47.100 --> 1:19:48.100]  We'll be back for everybody else.

[1:20:50.220 --> 1:20:53.300]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[1:20:53.300 --> 1:20:57.420]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, and investment advisors won't talk about
[1:20:57.420 --> 1:20:59.420]  gold for your IRA?
[1:20:59.420 --> 1:21:00.420]  That's right.
[1:21:00.420 --> 1:21:03.740]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[1:21:03.740 --> 1:21:08.980]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets
[1:21:08.980 --> 1:21:10.460]  for your retirement.
[1:21:10.460 --> 1:21:15.700]  The truth be told, gold and silver is outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and
[1:21:15.700 --> 1:21:18.580]  CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[1:21:18.580 --> 1:21:22.740]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping
[1:21:22.740 --> 1:21:24.060]  you in paper.
[1:21:24.060 --> 1:21:29.980]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[1:21:29.980 --> 1:21:34.500]  Look at left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[1:21:34.500 --> 1:21:37.340]  Call 800-686-2237.
[1:21:37.340 --> 1:21:39.860]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[1:21:39.860 --> 1:21:43.300]  Call 800-686-2237.
[1:21:43.300 --> 1:21:50.700]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[1:21:50.700 --> 1:21:54.540]  It is now time to rein in evil and bring them to justice.
[1:21:54.540 --> 1:21:59.500]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[1:21:59.500 --> 1:22:03.980]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population
[1:22:03.980 --> 1:22:04.980]  of the U.S.
[1:22:04.980 --> 1:22:08.880]  Though the people of the U.S. where their numbers and influence are strongest have primary
[1:22:08.880 --> 1:22:13.740]  responsibility for reigning the men and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate
[1:22:13.740 --> 1:22:15.940]  since they reside the world over.
[1:22:15.940 --> 1:22:20.340]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[1:22:20.340 --> 1:22:23.120]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:22:23.120 --> 1:22:27.620]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago, everything they have built
[1:22:27.620 --> 1:22:31.780]  over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established,
[1:22:31.780 --> 1:22:36.660]  the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind, we will undo through
[1:22:36.660 --> 1:22:39.620]  the authority that has now been delegated to us.
[1:22:39.620 --> 1:22:48.260]  Visit our website at unveilingthem.com, that's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G them.com, the message of
[1:22:48.260 --> 1:22:50.140]  his kingdom.
[1:22:50.140 --> 1:22:54.540]  When I learned that the accumulation of acidic waste was the likely cause of my painful joints,
[1:22:54.540 --> 1:22:58.900]  lack of energy and weight gain, I knew I would have to change to a more alkaline diet, but
[1:22:58.900 --> 1:23:00.900]  it just seems so difficult.
[1:23:00.900 --> 1:23:06.020]  Then a friend suggested I try a Jupiter water ionizer from SnyderHealth.com and detox my
[1:23:06.020 --> 1:23:10.900]  body even before I changed my diet by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[1:23:10.900 --> 1:23:11.900]  Drinking water?
[1:23:11.900 --> 1:23:13.580]  Now that's something I can handle.
[1:23:13.580 --> 1:23:17.020]  The guys at SnyderHealth took the time to explain all of the different options and helped me
[1:23:17.020 --> 1:23:19.140]  choose the ionizer that was right for me.
[1:23:19.140 --> 1:23:23.460]  I used my new Jupiter ionizer for everything, for drinking, for cooking, and since I've
[1:23:23.460 --> 1:23:28.020]  been drinking the water, I have more energy, my joint pains are gone, and I already lost
[1:23:28.020 --> 1:23:31.460]  7 pounds and my skin looks great.
[1:23:31.460 --> 1:23:38.380]  Give them a call today at 877-356-2508 to find out which ionizer is right for you.
[1:23:38.380 --> 1:23:42.380]  They offer a full 30-day money-back guarantee and free shipping, so there's absolutely
[1:23:42.380 --> 1:23:43.380]  no risk.
[1:23:43.380 --> 1:23:55.180]  You can visit them on the web at SnyderHealth.com, that's S-N-Y-D-E-R-Health.com.
[1:23:55.180 --> 1:23:58.460]  All right, we've got about 5 minutes left with Paul Watson and of course Keith Byrne
[1:23:58.460 --> 1:24:02.660]  from We Are Change Ireland, Paul joins us from England, he's the editor and head honcho
[1:24:02.660 --> 1:24:08.100]  over at PrisonPlanet.com with his brother Steve Watson.
[1:24:08.100 --> 1:24:14.900]  Gentlemen, during the behind the scenes, PrisonPlanet.tv, four minutes we were just doing for the
[1:24:14.900 --> 1:24:19.580]  main listeners, they are officially saying now in the towns, the news is saying yes,
[1:24:19.580 --> 1:24:23.820]  it was beaten, they're coming back now, they're going to use the bureaucracies to try to just
[1:24:23.820 --> 1:24:28.020]  force it by fiat, just like our North American Union, but in that is their defeat.
[1:24:28.020 --> 1:24:32.980]  They have to show now that in the US, in Ireland, in England, in Germany, in France, in the
[1:24:32.980 --> 1:24:37.660]  Netherlands, that they don't do the will of the people, they don't follow the Constitution,
[1:24:37.660 --> 1:24:41.260]  they let you vote and then if they don't like what you did, they just go and do it anyways.
[1:24:41.260 --> 1:24:45.100]  That's why they need a police state and restrict free speech and have all this because they're
[1:24:45.100 --> 1:24:47.540]  now just taking the gloves off and going into tyranny.
[1:24:47.540 --> 1:24:51.740]  Now we have to decide if we're going to speak up and come out of the woodwork to expose the
[1:24:51.740 --> 1:24:54.940]  fact that they've lost the moral high ground and discredit them or are we going to let
[1:24:54.940 --> 1:24:56.780]  them come in with tyranny.
[1:24:56.780 --> 1:24:57.780]  Go ahead Paul Watson.
[1:24:57.780 --> 1:25:03.140]  Well, yeah, that means and that's what the EU is designed to be all along.
[1:25:03.140 --> 1:25:08.940]  You know that as far back as the 50s when Bilderberg was first meeting, they were talking about
[1:25:08.940 --> 1:25:15.140]  a European Union and a single currency and then I did an article a few days ago highlighting
[1:25:15.140 --> 1:25:22.100]  what Vladimir Bukovsky, the Soviet dissident who first revealed the psychiatric torture
[1:25:22.100 --> 1:25:24.340]  camps that the Soviets were running.
[1:25:24.340 --> 1:25:32.180]  He saw a document in the 80s about how the European Union was designed to turn into what
[1:25:32.180 --> 1:25:36.900]  he called the E-U-S-S-R, a totalitarian federal state.
[1:25:36.900 --> 1:25:38.540]  And again, the bankers want that.
[1:25:38.540 --> 1:25:41.700]  They want, quote, easy administrative control.
[1:25:41.700 --> 1:25:44.580]  As Carol quickly wrote, call it fascists, call it communists.
[1:25:44.580 --> 1:25:49.100]  They want top down and they're going to use the green revolution as their excuse to cover
[1:25:49.100 --> 1:25:53.860]  up for the new consolidation and transfer of wealth for the middle class to the elites.
[1:25:53.860 --> 1:25:57.620]  Let's go back to Mr. Byrne from We Are a Change Ireland.
[1:25:57.620 --> 1:25:58.620]  Any other points you want to add?
[1:25:58.620 --> 1:26:01.820]  I mean, I just want to celebrate here, you know, they're going to come back at us.
[1:26:01.820 --> 1:26:03.460]  But again, we've had another major victory here.
[1:26:03.460 --> 1:26:07.980]  Yeah, Alex, another major victory and I couldn't have been done any better with all the campaigners
[1:26:07.980 --> 1:26:10.980]  and all the groups and all the activists that were out on the streets.
[1:26:10.980 --> 1:26:14.020]  Alex, do you want to speak to some of the members that helped out?
[1:26:14.020 --> 1:26:19.380]  These are the real guys that are on the streets till 10 p.m., a lot of nights, most days during
[1:26:19.380 --> 1:26:20.380]  the week.
[1:26:20.380 --> 1:26:21.380]  We have a few members.
[1:26:21.380 --> 1:26:22.380]  Are they there now?
[1:26:22.380 --> 1:26:23.380]  They're here right now.
[1:26:23.380 --> 1:26:24.380]  Okay.
[1:26:24.380 --> 1:26:27.820]  I'm going to have to get my next guest, Barbara Lowe Fisher, about the vaccines on about
[1:26:27.820 --> 1:26:28.820]  10 minutes late.
[1:26:28.820 --> 1:26:31.900]  I'm going to call her and let her know we're going to call her at 38 after then we got a
[1:26:31.900 --> 1:26:32.900]  Ralph Nader coming on.
[1:26:32.900 --> 1:26:38.100]  Mark Dice, David Edwards, about death squads in the U.S., top expert, academic on that
[1:26:38.100 --> 1:26:39.100]  subject.
[1:26:39.100 --> 1:26:42.100]  But yes, go ahead and introduce.
[1:26:42.100 --> 1:26:43.100]  Who else do we have there?
[1:26:43.100 --> 1:26:47.100]  Alex, we have Derek, we have Johnny, we have a guy called Brendan.
[1:26:47.100 --> 1:26:49.700]  Okay, give it to whoever you'd like.
[1:26:49.700 --> 1:26:51.180]  Two months ago.
[1:26:51.180 --> 1:26:54.180]  Hello, Alex, can you hear me?
[1:26:54.180 --> 1:26:55.180]  Yes, tell us what happened.
[1:26:55.180 --> 1:26:56.180]  Tell us who you are.
[1:26:56.180 --> 1:26:59.980]  My name is Brendan, it's a great victory for the Irish, it's a great victory for all the
[1:26:59.980 --> 1:27:00.980]  peoples in Europe.
[1:27:00.980 --> 1:27:04.100]  This has defeated the European drill class.
[1:27:04.100 --> 1:27:05.460]  They had that big project.
[1:27:05.460 --> 1:27:09.460]  They had a big project that was so great, they even called that Constitution.
[1:27:09.460 --> 1:27:13.020]  When the French rejected it and the Dutch rejected it, they used every dirty trick in
[1:27:13.020 --> 1:27:14.500]  the book to try and push it through.
[1:27:14.500 --> 1:27:18.540]  They changed the name, they changed the language, but they didn't change the intention and that's
[1:27:18.540 --> 1:27:19.540]  what the Irish realized.
[1:27:19.540 --> 1:27:23.620]  They realized what these people were up to and they voted no.
[1:27:23.620 --> 1:27:25.900]  Well, it sounds like you're excited there.
[1:27:25.900 --> 1:27:27.420]  What's the mood on the streets?
[1:27:27.420 --> 1:27:33.500]  Well, apparently the turnout was, let's say not the best, we're talking about a 44% turnout.
[1:27:33.500 --> 1:27:36.900]  Too many people just didn't understand what the hell was going on, but that was one of
[1:27:36.900 --> 1:27:37.900]  their dirty tricks.
[1:27:37.900 --> 1:27:42.420]  Sir, I understand you're excited, but you're over driving the microphone on the phone.
[1:27:42.420 --> 1:27:43.900]  Just bring the volume down a bit.
[1:27:43.900 --> 1:27:44.900]  Say that again.
[1:27:44.900 --> 1:27:45.900]  Okay.
[1:27:45.900 --> 1:27:49.820]  And the Irish people themselves, a lot of them just didn't understand what was going
[1:27:49.820 --> 1:27:50.820]  on.
[1:27:50.820 --> 1:27:54.540]  They were deliberately confused by the people in Brussels and their treaty.
[1:27:54.540 --> 1:27:58.380]  So a lot of the people who are active in the movement, certainly, they're very excited
[1:27:58.380 --> 1:27:59.380]  by the possibilities.
[1:27:59.380 --> 1:28:02.180]  I think it's going to take a while before the Irish fully realize exactly what this
[1:28:02.180 --> 1:28:03.180]  means.
[1:28:03.180 --> 1:28:04.180]  Absolutely.
[1:28:04.180 --> 1:28:08.140]  Great talking to you, sir, and I want to give credit where credit's due.
[1:28:08.140 --> 1:28:12.740]  You guys made a film, number one on Google video in Ireland for months and months and
[1:28:12.740 --> 1:28:16.340]  months, and I think that really helped turn the tide.
[1:28:16.340 --> 1:28:20.740]  Yeah, Alex, and it couldn't have been done any better with two members, Dave and Anthony.
[1:28:20.740 --> 1:28:21.740]  They really put that together.
[1:28:21.740 --> 1:28:24.740]  But Alex, I'll introduce you to Derek.
[1:28:24.740 --> 1:28:27.980]  Derek is a very hard street activist who likes to act.
[1:28:27.980 --> 1:28:28.980]  Derek, tell us.
[1:28:28.980 --> 1:28:29.980]  Derek, we're about to break.
[1:28:29.980 --> 1:28:30.980]  Tell us what happened.
[1:28:30.980 --> 1:28:31.980]  Tell us what you're doing.
[1:28:31.980 --> 1:28:32.980]  Hi, Alex.
[1:28:32.980 --> 1:28:37.740]  Basically, for the last few months, I've been out as much as I can.
[1:28:37.740 --> 1:28:41.580]  Cams in, leaflets, pump, bumper stickers on taxi driver's cars.
[1:28:41.580 --> 1:28:44.500]  Now, talking to the taxi drivers, they're telling me how they're living.
[1:28:44.500 --> 1:28:46.020]  No, they can't afford to live.
[1:28:46.020 --> 1:28:47.340]  They can't afford to make money.
[1:28:47.340 --> 1:28:52.340]  So, thanks to the EU, controlled regulations and that.
[1:28:52.340 --> 1:28:53.340]  Ingenious.
[1:28:53.340 --> 1:28:56.180]  So, basically, a lot of people are away to it.
[1:28:56.180 --> 1:28:59.100]  They just don't see the big picture, but they can feel it in the pocket already.
[1:28:59.100 --> 1:29:02.580]  They feel it with the mortgage rates going up, you know, the cost of living, the rates
[1:29:02.580 --> 1:29:08.380]  to the bottom of wages, influx of mass immigration, which is, you know, it's driving undercourt
[1:29:08.380 --> 1:29:12.620]  and Irish workers, and it's exploiting the foreign nationals coming in.
[1:29:12.620 --> 1:29:14.620]  It's international, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:29:14.620 --> 1:29:17.220]  We're going to come back to you guys in a moment, put you on hold now.
[1:29:17.220 --> 1:29:21.620]  It is international, the globalist ring in an international grid of tyranny, but all
[1:29:21.620 --> 1:29:26.660]  of us worldwide are brought together for liberty, from England to Ireland, to Germany, to Japan,
[1:29:26.660 --> 1:29:31.940]  from Russia to Mexico, from Chile to Greenland, the resistance marches on.
[1:29:31.940 --> 1:29:37.260]  Paul Watson from the UK, prison-planet editor, and more with We Are Change Ireland, a great
[1:29:37.260 --> 1:29:40.980]  victory against the New World Order when we get back.
[1:29:40.980 --> 1:29:44.660]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[1:29:44.660 --> 1:29:50.860]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:50.860 --> 1:29:55.300]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history comes
[1:29:55.300 --> 1:30:01.540]  the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely
[1:30:01.540 --> 1:30:04.020]  destroys the official fable forever.
[1:30:04.020 --> 1:30:08.300]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which
[1:30:08.300 --> 1:30:13.100]  family members receive answers to their questions, and the true perpetrators of the horrendous
[1:30:13.100 --> 1:30:14.940]  crime are brought to justice.
[1:30:14.940 --> 1:30:20.060]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose, from hijackers being trained at US
[1:30:20.060 --> 1:30:22.460]  military bases to bombs in the buildings.
[1:30:22.460 --> 1:30:26.220]  Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[1:30:26.220 --> 1:30:31.820]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.
[1:30:31.820 --> 1:30:35.700]  While you're visiting the online video store, be sure to check out the huge discounts on
[1:30:35.700 --> 1:30:40.820]  films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds
[1:30:40.820 --> 1:30:41.820]  of other titles.
[1:30:41.820 --> 1:30:44.780]  We're in a no-holds-far information war.
[1:30:44.780 --> 1:30:49.180]  Truth is our weapon, and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back
[1:30:49.180 --> 1:30:50.180]  to Big Brother.
[1:30:50.180 --> 1:30:51.180]  Hi, neighbor.
[1:30:51.180 --> 1:30:55.780]  They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[1:30:55.780 --> 1:30:59.060]  Certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was
[1:30:59.060 --> 1:31:00.860]  none left at any price.
[1:31:00.860 --> 1:31:04.580]  We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for those
[1:31:04.580 --> 1:31:06.600]  unable to care for themselves.
[1:31:06.600 --> 1:31:10.780]  We would intend not to be standing in the breadline with the ignorant and the foolish
[1:31:10.780 --> 1:31:14.180]  who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue.
[1:31:14.180 --> 1:31:19.940]  If the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence, the breadline may have no bread.
[1:31:19.940 --> 1:31:24.300]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place, the good intentions
[1:31:24.300 --> 1:31:27.660]  alone to get a supply of food will not feed us.
[1:31:27.660 --> 1:31:32.740]  Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future.
[1:31:32.740 --> 1:31:36.220]  Call 800-409-5633.
[1:31:36.220 --> 1:31:39.540]  800-409-5633.
[1:31:39.540 --> 1:31:47.020]  On the web, eFoodsDirect.com, who am I, nobody, Steve Shank, someone who cares.
[1:32:27.300 --> 1:32:31.020]  without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[1:32:31.020 --> 1:32:33.700]  Laser technology at its best.
[1:32:33.700 --> 1:32:47.500]  For more information, call 702-953-0267 or visit www.LASEMEDINC.com.
[1:32:47.500 --> 1:32:50.500]  Call 702-953-Z.
[1:32:59.220 --> 1:33:01.220]  I salute Ireland.
[1:33:01.220 --> 1:33:06.660]  I salute the Netherlands, I salute France.
[1:33:06.660 --> 1:33:09.580]  Over there, they don't deny that you exist.
[1:33:09.580 --> 1:33:16.180]  They admit it, but they didn't for the first 40-plus years of its embryonic growth.
[1:33:16.180 --> 1:33:18.940]  Now everything is compounded, accelerated, telescoped.
[1:33:18.940 --> 1:33:22.820]  What would happen in 50 years is happening in two years now.
[1:33:22.820 --> 1:33:24.420]  We are going under international regulation.
[1:33:24.420 --> 1:33:25.420]  I have a business.
[1:33:25.420 --> 1:33:29.260]  I get all of the North American Union documents telling me I'm under their control.
[1:33:29.260 --> 1:33:33.420]  I show them to you on TV, show them to you on the web.
[1:33:33.420 --> 1:33:39.940]  Oh man, I'm going to play out the rest of this song and then we'll go back and say
[1:33:39.940 --> 1:33:44.020]  bye to We Are Change UK and Paul Watson.
[1:33:44.020 --> 1:34:01.820]  The rest of this song is for you.
[1:34:01.820 --> 1:34:04.860]  I tell you what, cue up the bandit.
[1:34:04.860 --> 1:34:05.860]  Because that song is ending.
[1:34:05.860 --> 1:34:07.860]  I'm going to play a couple minutes of Smoky and the Bandit.
[1:34:07.860 --> 1:34:08.860]  John, you got that?
[1:34:08.860 --> 1:34:09.860]  Yeah.
[1:34:09.860 --> 1:34:15.140]  Tell me when you get that cued up and as we say bye to them, we'll go out with Smoky
[1:34:15.140 --> 1:34:16.140]  and the bandit.
[1:34:16.140 --> 1:34:17.140]  You were on vacation, John.
[1:34:17.140 --> 1:34:19.940]  That was sent up last week and on Monday.
[1:34:19.940 --> 1:34:24.300]  Going back to We Are Change Ireland, anything else you guys want to add, anybody else from
[1:34:24.300 --> 1:34:28.500]  We Are Change Ireland there who wants to jump on the phone and talk to us worldwide right
[1:34:28.500 --> 1:34:29.500]  now?
[1:34:29.500 --> 1:34:30.500]  No problem, Alex.
[1:34:30.500 --> 1:34:31.500]  Here's Johnny over.
[1:34:31.500 --> 1:34:32.500]  Hey Alex.
[1:34:32.500 --> 1:34:40.260]  A very hard few months there, just want to say thanks to all the groups and all the activists
[1:34:40.260 --> 1:34:45.060]  and especially thanks to yourself and other We Are Change groups for giving me the inspiration
[1:34:45.060 --> 1:34:48.740]  to do what I'm doing and also thanks to the people who've listened to us because it really
[1:34:48.740 --> 1:34:52.620]  takes two people to tell the truth, the speaker and the listener, you know.
[1:34:52.620 --> 1:34:56.460]  Just want to say thanks very much.
[1:34:56.460 --> 1:34:58.660]  Well my friend, I just want to thank all of you.
[1:34:58.660 --> 1:35:03.740]  Anybody else there from We Are Change UK, tip of the spear, Defeater and Lisbon Treaty?
[1:35:03.740 --> 1:35:04.740]  No one else here, Alex.
[1:35:04.740 --> 1:35:07.580]  Just thought that everybody you've spoken to, that's very...
[1:35:07.580 --> 1:35:09.380]  All right, gentlemen.
[1:35:09.380 --> 1:35:10.380]  Thank you so much.
[1:35:10.380 --> 1:35:15.220]  I'll check in with you next week as this unfolds and I appreciate you coming on with us.
[1:35:15.220 --> 1:35:16.220]  No problem, Alex.
[1:35:16.220 --> 1:35:18.540]  Have a pint of Guinness on us.
[1:35:18.540 --> 1:35:21.100]  Oh man, take care guys.
[1:35:21.100 --> 1:35:22.420]  We love you over there.
[1:35:22.420 --> 1:35:27.540]  Going to Paul Watson, enclosing Paul, reassessing, recapping, anything else you need to add?
[1:35:27.540 --> 1:35:30.580]  Well, they say you can't fight the city hall.
[1:35:30.580 --> 1:35:32.820]  The media tells us we can't make a difference.
[1:35:32.820 --> 1:35:38.060]  Here's an example of a small group of committed individuals who have picked a topic.
[1:35:38.060 --> 1:35:44.420]  It was a close vote despite the vote fraud and the few percentage points that won it,
[1:35:44.420 --> 1:35:48.740]  the sovereignty could have been the thousands of people that they woke up so you can't
[1:35:48.740 --> 1:35:52.060]  fight the city hall, you can't make a difference.
[1:35:52.060 --> 1:35:58.180]  You've got continual reporting at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com as all of this unfolds with
[1:35:58.180 --> 1:36:03.180]  the Lisbon Treaty as the enemy regroups and comes in with a bureaucratic implementation
[1:36:03.180 --> 1:36:07.740]  by stealth as their North American Union documents state.
[1:36:07.740 --> 1:36:11.780]  Just absolutely historical things that we see unfolding here.
[1:36:11.780 --> 1:36:12.780]  We are the people.
[1:36:12.780 --> 1:36:13.780]  We have the will of the people.
[1:36:13.780 --> 1:36:14.780]  We have common sense.
[1:36:14.780 --> 1:36:19.100]  We have due process, the Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence,
[1:36:19.100 --> 1:36:20.300]  the organic law.
[1:36:20.300 --> 1:36:21.300]  We're the good guys.
[1:36:21.300 --> 1:36:25.780]  The government is owned by foreign corporations that are playing God and trying to piratically
[1:36:25.780 --> 1:36:27.260]  seize our society.
[1:36:27.260 --> 1:36:28.780]  Paul Watson, God bless you.
[1:36:28.780 --> 1:36:30.100]  Paul Watson, God bless you.
[1:36:30.100 --> 1:36:31.100]  You bet.
[1:36:31.100 --> 1:36:34.820]  I'm going to go ahead now as we get our next guest lined up and play Smoky in the Bandit.
[1:36:34.820 --> 1:36:39.320]  This was our theme song when we were out on the road in Bilderberg being followed by
[1:36:39.320 --> 1:36:45.380]  secret police being chased, being surveilled and I think this song says it all, ladies
[1:36:45.380 --> 1:36:52.380]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are the rag tag and we are going to win with God's help here it is.
[1:37:38.380 --> 1:37:40.380]  And it's show time to get there.
[1:37:41.380 --> 1:37:43.380]  Just watch your bandit run.
[1:37:43.380 --> 1:37:44.380]  We're on the side of right.
[1:37:44.380 --> 1:37:45.380]  We're going to win.
[1:37:45.380 --> 1:37:47.380]  We're never going to stop.
[1:37:47.380 --> 1:37:48.380]  We're never going to back down.
[1:37:48.380 --> 1:37:49.380]  We're committed.
[1:37:49.380 --> 1:37:50.380]  Whatever you do to us.
[1:37:50.380 --> 1:37:51.380]  Whatever you try.
[1:37:51.380 --> 1:37:53.380]  We've got the initiative.
[1:37:53.380 --> 1:37:54.380]  We've got the focus.
[1:37:54.380 --> 1:37:55.380]  We've got the will.
[1:37:55.380 --> 1:37:56.380]  Tiredness.
[1:37:56.380 --> 1:38:00.380]  And I'm telling everybody who's been on the fence, choose sides now.
[1:38:00.380 --> 1:38:02.380]  Get on our team now.
[1:38:02.380 --> 1:38:05.380]  Come in for the big win against the New World Order.
[1:38:05.380 --> 1:38:07.380]  Woo, I love it.
[1:38:07.380 --> 1:38:10.380]  I'm so excited they shot down the Lipsid Treaty.
[1:38:10.380 --> 1:38:11.380]  Woo, yeah.
[1:38:11.380 --> 1:38:15.380]  And now they're going to try to bring it in through tyranny and show everybody who they are.
[1:38:15.380 --> 1:38:17.380]  This song's for you, UK.
[1:38:17.380 --> 1:38:19.380]  This song's for you, Ireland.
[1:38:19.380 --> 1:38:22.380]  This song's for all of you fighting North American Union.
[1:38:22.380 --> 1:38:24.380]  Oh, Smokey's got his ears on.
[1:38:24.380 --> 1:38:26.380]  And he's hot on our trail.
[1:38:26.380 --> 1:38:28.380]  Yeah, we're going to beat him, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:38:28.380 --> 1:38:54.380]  Here it is.
[1:38:54.380 --> 1:38:58.380]  So you've got the dodging, you've got the ducking, you've got to keep that diesel truckin'.
[1:38:58.380 --> 1:39:02.380]  Just put that hammer down and give it here.
[1:39:02.380 --> 1:39:06.380]  He's found it down, load it up and truck it.
[1:39:06.380 --> 1:39:09.380]  Are we going to do what they say can't be done?
[1:39:09.380 --> 1:39:12.380]  We've got a long way to go.
[1:39:12.380 --> 1:39:14.380]  And it's your time to get there.
[1:39:14.380 --> 1:39:28.380]  Yeah, don't touch the brakes.
[1:39:28.380 --> 1:39:32.380]  Just drop that hammer down and go all the way.
[1:39:32.380 --> 1:39:33.380]  Be part of history, folks.
[1:39:33.380 --> 1:39:34.380]  You're only alive once.
[1:39:34.380 --> 1:39:35.380]  This is history.
[1:39:35.380 --> 1:39:37.380]  Are you part of the fight against the New World Order?
[1:39:37.380 --> 1:39:39.380]  Are you coming in for the big win?
[1:39:39.380 --> 1:39:41.380]  That's a question you've got to ask yourselves.
[1:39:41.380 --> 1:39:42.380]  This is life and death.
[1:39:42.380 --> 1:39:44.380]  The enemy's given us no quarter.
[1:39:44.380 --> 1:39:46.380]  We are kicking their butt every time we take the field.
[1:39:46.380 --> 1:39:49.380]  But most of us don't take the field.
[1:39:49.380 --> 1:39:52.380]  Most of you don't know the historical things that are happening,
[1:39:52.380 --> 1:39:54.380]  the things that are going on around you.
[1:39:54.380 --> 1:39:56.380]  And just how amazing they are.
[1:39:56.380 --> 1:39:59.380]  Do we have our next guest?
[1:39:59.380 --> 1:40:02.380]  Folks, this is a perfect time to have this guest on in the next 20 minutes.
[1:40:02.380 --> 1:40:04.380]  And I want to have her back up for a couple of hours in their future.
[1:40:04.380 --> 1:40:08.380]  They've got the site, the organization, the group that really understands what's happening with the vaccines,
[1:40:08.380 --> 1:40:10.380]  the eugenics program.
[1:40:10.380 --> 1:40:15.380]  In 2000, Congressman Dan Burton sent in federal investigators with a congressional subpoena,
[1:40:15.380 --> 1:40:20.380]  seized documents from the CDC, the EPA, the FDA.
[1:40:20.380 --> 1:40:25.380]  And in their own documents, they admitted that millions have been brain damaged by mercury in the vaccines.
[1:40:25.380 --> 1:40:27.380]  Then the media lied and said there was no mercury in it.
[1:40:27.380 --> 1:40:28.380]  Now they've had to admit it's in there.
[1:40:28.380 --> 1:40:29.380]  They've had to admit.
[1:40:29.380 --> 1:40:30.380]  Federal courts have admitted.
[1:40:30.380 --> 1:40:33.380]  Doctors at Blue Ribbon Panel had to admit it caused brain damage.
[1:40:33.380 --> 1:40:35.380]  We've been right again.
[1:40:35.380 --> 1:40:39.380]  Now Charlie Sheen, my friend, and his ex-wife,
[1:40:39.380 --> 1:40:40.380]  he's been to court.
[1:40:40.380 --> 1:40:43.380]  He's been fighting, trying to keep her from vaccinating his children.
[1:40:43.380 --> 1:40:46.380]  The news is demonizing him, attacking him.
[1:40:46.380 --> 1:40:49.380]  They put a crazy looking picture of him up on the web on TMZ yesterday.
[1:40:49.380 --> 1:40:53.380]  Charlie Sheen tells Denise Richards, don't stick my kids.
[1:40:53.380 --> 1:40:57.380]  And there's the article where folks watching on prisonplanet.tv right now.
[1:40:57.380 --> 1:41:00.380]  And it says, Charlie Sheen thinks vaccinations are poison.
[1:41:00.380 --> 1:41:01.380]  He doesn't think.
[1:41:01.380 --> 1:41:03.380]  He knows this guy's obsessed with researching things.
[1:41:03.380 --> 1:41:04.380]  That's all he does.
[1:41:04.380 --> 1:41:05.380]  He does like 10 hours a day.
[1:41:05.380 --> 1:41:06.380]  It's incredible.
[1:41:06.380 --> 1:41:09.380]  That's the guy that doesn't party, doesn't play around, doesn't just...
[1:41:09.380 --> 1:41:11.380]  He drinks black coffee and studies the New World Order.
[1:41:11.380 --> 1:41:13.380]  I've got a chance to meet his mother a couple of times.
[1:41:13.380 --> 1:41:16.380]  Sheen, they've been known all about their whole life.
[1:41:16.380 --> 1:41:17.380]  Great people.
[1:41:17.380 --> 1:41:21.380]  So do a lot of other celebrities, including Jenny McCarthy and her boyfriend Jim Carrey.
[1:41:21.380 --> 1:41:27.380]  But his ex-wives and these Richards apparently thinks that both reality TV shows and vaccinations are safe for kids.
[1:41:27.380 --> 1:41:29.380]  So naturally there's a big battle brewing.
[1:41:29.380 --> 1:41:35.380]  TMZ reports that Sheen sent a legal letter to the girl's physician stating the lack of consent for doctors to treat the daughters.
[1:41:35.380 --> 1:41:39.380]  And then they go into the media demonizing him for doing something that he's been proven right.
[1:41:39.380 --> 1:41:45.380]  I want to now bring you Barbara Lowe Fisher, president of the National Vaccine Information Center.
[1:41:45.380 --> 1:41:46.380]  We'll give you out the website.
[1:41:46.380 --> 1:41:48.380]  But you've got about 20 minutes, ma'am.
[1:41:48.380 --> 1:41:52.380]  We appreciate you breaking down the group, what we're facing, what's in the vaccines.
[1:41:52.380 --> 1:41:58.380]  And there is no law we've got to take them, though New Jersey and New York are trying to pass laws to do that right now.
[1:41:58.380 --> 1:41:59.380]  You're on the year.
[1:41:59.380 --> 1:42:09.380]  Okay, well, I've been doing this for 26 years, fighting this fight to inform the public about the truth about vaccination, the risks associated with vaccination.
[1:42:09.380 --> 1:42:17.380]  And fighting for the freedom in this country to be able to choose which vaccines we want to use or not use any vaccines.
[1:42:17.380 --> 1:42:25.380]  In other words, I think it is a human right to be able to choose what to decide what you're willing to risk your life or your child's life for.
[1:42:25.380 --> 1:42:28.380]  Vaccines carry a risk of injury or death.
[1:42:28.380 --> 1:42:31.380]  And that risk can be greater for some than others.
[1:42:31.380 --> 1:42:40.380]  But over the last 25 years, we've seen the government recommend twice as many vaccines and three times as many doses of vaccines.
[1:42:40.380 --> 1:42:47.380]  They're up to 50 something now, and if people were to listen to you and the medical doctors who warned 25 years ago, we wouldn't have millions and millions of autistic children.
[1:42:47.380 --> 1:42:48.380]  Absolutely.
[1:42:48.380 --> 1:42:53.380]  We warned back in the 1980s about DPT vaccine that was brain damaging children.
[1:42:53.380 --> 1:42:58.380]  And Congress finally said, wait a minute, we can't have all these lawsuits, we're going to have to pass a law.
[1:42:58.380 --> 1:43:06.380]  And they did in 1986, protecting the manufacturers and the doctors and liability because the truth was getting out and people were going to court.
[1:43:06.380 --> 1:43:10.380]  And the vaccine manufacturers said, we're going to leave this country without any vaccine.
[1:43:10.380 --> 1:43:12.380]  So the government says we're going to protect you.
[1:43:12.380 --> 1:43:15.380]  Well, since then, we have seen an addition of so many vaccines.
[1:43:15.380 --> 1:43:26.380]  In fact, with the CDC's latest recommendation of a flu shot for every child from six months to 18 years old, we're up to 69 doses of 16 vaccines.
[1:43:26.380 --> 1:43:29.380]  The government recommends for our kids through age 18.
[1:43:29.380 --> 1:43:36.380]  And they simply have not done the scientific studies to prove that this kind of manipulation of the immune system is safe.
[1:43:36.380 --> 1:43:45.380]  And here's a microcosm on their own Gardasil insert go to Gardasil's website, Merck folks brought you by ox and all the heart attacks.
[1:43:45.380 --> 1:43:48.380]  You go there and they say this probably doesn't even protect you.
[1:43:48.380 --> 1:43:49.380]  There's hundreds of screens.
[1:43:49.380 --> 1:43:51.380]  This only covers four to six.
[1:43:51.380 --> 1:43:56.380]  If you already have the virus as most Americans have, it gives you a 45% increase in actually getting cancer.
[1:43:56.380 --> 1:43:58.380]  But it doesn't matter.
[1:43:58.380 --> 1:43:59.380]  People think it's a cancer cure.
[1:43:59.380 --> 1:44:01.380]  They're out taking it.
[1:44:01.380 --> 1:44:03.380]  Yeah, that's a vaccine, the newest vaccine.
[1:44:03.380 --> 1:44:08.380]  They've only studied that vaccine in fewer than 1200 little girls under the age of 16.
[1:44:08.380 --> 1:44:10.380]  And there are a bunch of deaths and they still approved it.
[1:44:10.380 --> 1:44:13.380]  And they still approved it and they targeted 11 year old girls.
[1:44:13.380 --> 1:44:16.380]  They'd only studied it in about 111 year old girls.
[1:44:16.380 --> 1:44:31.380]  The government said every little 11 year old girl should take it and Merck, within six months of licensure by the FDA, went through all of the states trying to ram vaccine mandates in, you know, so that all six grade girls would have to get it.
[1:44:31.380 --> 1:44:38.380]  And the thing Perry to sign on to it, it kicked in vaccine liability because they knew it was a dangerous vaccine.
[1:44:38.380 --> 1:44:42.380]  And so now we, the taxpayer pays for all the damage, but nobody ever hears about it.
[1:44:42.380 --> 1:44:51.380]  But we did organize a national effort to, and parents went into their legislatures in the states and they opposed this vaccine being mandated.
[1:44:51.380 --> 1:44:56.380]  And for the first time in a quarter century, we beat back a government mandate.
[1:44:56.380 --> 1:45:00.380]  And so what you said at the top of your show of this segment, you are right.
[1:45:00.380 --> 1:45:07.380]  If people will stand up for their right to be free to make these kinds of choices, they can make a difference.
[1:45:07.380 --> 1:45:12.380]  But they have to get out of being apathetic and they have to stand up and be counted.
[1:45:12.380 --> 1:45:15.380]  Absolutely. This is all about setting precedence.
[1:45:15.380 --> 1:45:29.380]  Continue to break down the types of, I mean, they admit all these different types of cancer viruses found in vaccines, all the mercury, all the DNA fragments, all the toxins, all the different chemicals, the different funguses,
[1:45:29.380 --> 1:45:31.380]  the different bacteria.
[1:45:31.380 --> 1:45:35.380]  I mean, they forced the anthrax shot, later admitting that it killed a bunch of the troops.
[1:45:35.380 --> 1:45:39.380]  They forced smallpox shots that they had to suspend it because it was killing so many people.
[1:45:39.380 --> 1:45:41.380]  But it always is in the back of the paper.
[1:45:41.380 --> 1:45:43.380]  I mean, this is a holocaust.
[1:45:43.380 --> 1:45:48.380]  No, the people just generally do not understand what are the components of vaccines.
[1:45:48.380 --> 1:45:51.380]  There's aluminum. Yes, there's mercury.
[1:45:51.380 --> 1:45:57.380]  They've taken mercury out of some of the vaccines, but they've left it in the flu vaccine, for example, that we're trying to give every kid.
[1:45:57.380 --> 1:45:59.380]  They're saying every kid has to get every year.
[1:45:59.380 --> 1:46:01.380]  There's phenoxyethanol.
[1:46:01.380 --> 1:46:07.380]  There's avatitious agent contamination with virus DNA from viruses and bacteria they can't screen for.
[1:46:07.380 --> 1:46:13.380]  There is, you know, it's plus lab altered viruses and bacteria.
[1:46:13.380 --> 1:46:26.380]  So, you know, when you manipulate the immune system over and over again, typically by injecting into the body these components and these lab altered viruses and bacteria, you have no idea what is going to happen,
[1:46:26.380 --> 1:46:36.380]  particularly if you are a person who has, for example, in the family, a history of autoimmunity like thyroid disease or rheumatoid arthritis or asthma or severe allergies,
[1:46:36.380 --> 1:46:43.380]  which a lot of us have, that we may already be predisposed to kind of having a hypersensitive immune system.
[1:46:43.380 --> 1:46:48.380]  If you keep hitting a kid over and over again, sometimes with eight to ten vaccines on one day repeatedly,
[1:46:48.380 --> 1:46:59.380]  you are going to have a greater number of people who would ordinarily not have expressed that autoimmunity become damaged, brain and immune system damaged.
[1:46:59.380 --> 1:47:01.380]  Give out the website for your organization.
[1:47:01.380 --> 1:47:09.380]  We have the website is www.nvic.org for National Vaccine Information Center.org.
[1:47:09.380 --> 1:47:13.380]  We also have a new website, standupbcannot.org.
[1:47:13.380 --> 1:47:25.380]  Okay, we're talking to the president of the National Vaccine Information Center, the biggest advocacy group for choice for people having their right to not be medicated against their will and to inform the public about what's happening.
[1:47:25.380 --> 1:47:27.380]  I don't normally get in Charlie Sheen's business.
[1:47:27.380 --> 1:47:36.380]  I'm good friends with him and he, you know, privately in the past before this was all public, even when she divorced him, she brought up these issues saying he's crazy.
[1:47:36.380 --> 1:47:38.380]  He believes vaccines are dangerous.
[1:47:38.380 --> 1:47:47.380]  Meanwhile, Jamie McCarthy's on Oprah, it's all over the news, Larry King Live's admitting it, the government's admitting it, and then now she's attacking him in the media again, trying to medicate.
[1:47:47.380 --> 1:47:51.380]  I think we're going to make a YouTube video of this and I'll send it to Charlie and he might give it to her.
[1:47:51.380 --> 1:47:54.380]  He's nicely tried to educate her for years.
[1:47:54.380 --> 1:47:59.380]  This is one of the reasons they actually split up because he cares about his daughters so much.
[1:47:59.380 --> 1:48:03.380]  And we can probably get this to Denise and you don't have a dog in this fight.
[1:48:03.380 --> 1:48:06.380]  Would you like to talk to Denise Richards for a minute or two?
[1:48:06.380 --> 1:48:09.380]  If you had a minute or two to talk to her, this will probably get to her.
[1:48:09.380 --> 1:48:10.380]  What would you say to Denise?
[1:48:10.380 --> 1:48:12.380]  She needs to become educated.
[1:48:12.380 --> 1:48:13.380]  This is a very serious issue.
[1:48:13.380 --> 1:48:17.380]  I actually, many years ago, had a talk with Charlie Sheen about this.
[1:48:17.380 --> 1:48:19.380]  I tell you, Charlie is a freedom fighter.
[1:48:19.380 --> 1:48:24.380]  He's an incredible guy and he is educated about this issue.
[1:48:24.380 --> 1:48:34.380]  She really needs to open up her eyes, take another look at it and do it because she needs to protect her children just in case they may be at high risk for having vaccine reactions.
[1:48:34.380 --> 1:48:41.380]  How could she say he's crazy when he's given her the research and it's all over the news that it's causing problems?
[1:48:41.380 --> 1:48:43.380]  I don't know.
[1:48:43.380 --> 1:48:46.380]  I don't know that personal situation.
[1:48:46.380 --> 1:48:49.380]  I only know that Charlie has educated himself.
[1:48:49.380 --> 1:48:51.380]  He has done a lot of research.
[1:48:51.380 --> 1:48:52.380]  I agree with you.
[1:48:52.380 --> 1:48:56.380]  He is very articulate about the subject.
[1:48:56.380 --> 1:49:01.380]  I think that mothers and fathers, whether they're together in a marriage together or whether they split up,
[1:49:01.380 --> 1:49:09.380]  they really need to take this issue seriously and not make it a battleground for who gets custody or whether one person is a better parent than another.
[1:49:09.380 --> 1:49:10.380]  This is serious stuff.
[1:49:10.380 --> 1:49:18.380]  These vaccines can impact on brain and immune system function and everybody needs to get educated about it before they get one more vaccine.
[1:49:18.380 --> 1:49:27.380]  They're also tied into autoimmune diseases causing cancers and they found so many, not just SV40 but so many other cancer viruses in every major vaccine line.
[1:49:27.380 --> 1:49:32.380]  This is the situation with, for example, polio vaccine.
[1:49:32.380 --> 1:49:40.380]  A lot of people don't know that that vaccine was contaminated with SV40, which is a cancer-causing virus.
[1:49:40.380 --> 1:49:49.380]  They now have found SV40 DNA in the bone, brain and lung cancers of both children and adults.
[1:49:49.380 --> 1:49:57.380]  It also, those vaccines were contaminated with SIV, Simeon Immune Efficiency Virus, which has been associated with HIV.
[1:49:57.380 --> 1:50:05.380]  There is a tremendous under, you know, a lot of people, yeah, there is a potential HIV connection to the polio vaccines.
[1:50:05.380 --> 1:50:12.380]  Well, Dr. Salk has now admitted that the monkeys they used for the polio vaccine have been used in bio weapons tests in Africa.
[1:50:12.380 --> 1:50:19.380]  Yeah, that's the connection is the experimental polio vaccine campaigns in Africa in the 1950s and 60s.
[1:50:19.380 --> 1:50:23.380]  And over 100 million Americans got inoculations from those batches.
[1:50:23.380 --> 1:50:24.380]  Correct.
[1:50:24.380 --> 1:50:25.380]  Stay there, we'll be right back.
[1:50:25.380 --> 1:50:27.380]  Hey, sorry Denise, we just know the facts.
[1:50:27.380 --> 1:50:33.380]  Your ex-husband knows the facts and I'm tired of you picking on Charlie and being ignorant.
[1:50:33.380 --> 1:50:39.380]  And you've made this a public issue on your stupid reality show to torture him and we're sick of it.
[1:50:39.380 --> 1:50:47.380]  So his friends are weighing in and telling you, stop doing this to your children just to make fun of your husband who happens to know what's going on, your ex-husband.
[1:50:47.380 --> 1:51:10.380]  We'll be right back with our guest.

[1:51:50.380 --> 1:51:52.380]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[1:51:52.380 --> 1:51:56.380]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[1:51:56.380 --> 1:51:58.380]  But in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope.
[1:51:58.380 --> 1:52:01.380]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[1:52:01.380 --> 1:52:07.380]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[1:52:07.380 --> 1:52:11.380]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[1:52:50.380 --> 1:52:56.380]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[1:52:56.380 --> 1:53:01.380]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for the American Empire instead of what's fair for the American people.
[1:53:01.380 --> 1:53:07.380]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism, which is why you should be reading The Nationalist Times each month.

[1:53:50.380 --> 1:54:01.380]  Ralph Nader's schedule to be calling in in the next 10 minutes, and Mark Dice being death-threaded on National Radio by Michael Reagan.
[1:54:01.380 --> 1:54:03.380]  This is serious.
[1:54:03.380 --> 1:54:06.380]  Totally jam-packed Friday transmission here, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:54:06.380 --> 1:54:08.380]  Lisbon treaty going down in flames.
[1:54:08.380 --> 1:54:12.380]  EU swears to try to ram it through now, through the bureaucracy illegally.
[1:54:12.380 --> 1:54:15.380]  We are talking to Barbara Lowe Fisher.
[1:54:15.380 --> 1:54:21.380]  I didn't mean to bring Charlie Sheen into this, but the point he's being attacked in national media right now, all the evidence is on his side.
[1:54:21.380 --> 1:54:27.380]  He told me he'd done hundreds of hours of research, and I was just talking to Barbara Lowe Fisher.
[1:54:27.380 --> 1:54:31.380]  She said, Charlie called her years ago and did an hour and a half research with her on the phone.
[1:54:31.380 --> 1:54:33.380]  I mean, that's an example.
[1:54:33.380 --> 1:54:39.380]  I didn't even know she knew Charlie, and here he is with another activist group with scientists and doctors on their group doing research.
[1:54:39.380 --> 1:54:51.380]  And then Denise does no research, like so many other mothers and fathers out there who then just say, Barbara, they lied for years and said that we were lying that Mercury was even in the vaccines.
[1:54:51.380 --> 1:54:53.380]  Or then they said Mercury was good for you.
[1:54:53.380 --> 1:54:55.380]  In fact, John, cue that Mercury, good for you, clip up.
[1:54:55.380 --> 1:55:02.380]  Your comments on the amount of deception they put out, and then now all over the country at the start of the school year, they announce it's the law.
[1:55:02.380 --> 1:55:07.380]  Come to the courthouse, come to the sports stadium, be inoculated, or you'll be arrested, and there's no law.
[1:55:07.380 --> 1:55:09.380]  Then you've got that mass fraud.
[1:55:09.380 --> 1:55:11.380]  I mean, this is so incredible, Barbara.
[1:55:11.380 --> 1:55:13.380]  They're trying to do in New York.
[1:55:13.380 --> 1:55:24.380]  They're trying to ram through legislation that would make the CDC a de facto lawmaking body, that every time the CDC recommends a new vaccine, it would be automatically added to the state laws in New York.
[1:55:24.380 --> 1:55:36.380]  And they want to do this in every state, and they're even going so far as to say every new vaccine for a sexually transmitted disease like HPV or hepatitis B would be given to children without their parents' permission.
[1:55:36.380 --> 1:55:40.380]  Now, they're really, really going beyond the line.
[1:55:40.380 --> 1:55:45.380]  And I think that people don't realize that these laws get passed, and they never even know about it.
[1:55:45.380 --> 1:55:48.380]  And they need to stay, they need to get on our website.
[1:55:48.380 --> 1:55:59.380]  They need to sign up for the vaccine e-news I put out every week that alerts people about paying attention to what's happening in their state, because they're going to wake up one day and they're not going to be able to say no to that.
[1:55:59.380 --> 1:56:07.380]  There are hundreds of vaccines in more than 2,000 clinical trials around the world that are being created by Big Pharma.
[1:56:07.380 --> 1:56:10.380]  And then Big Pharma comes in and makes your government make you take it.
[1:56:10.380 --> 1:56:17.380]  Let's play this local CBS clip, but the similar news copy was read all over the country saying Mercury is actually good for your brain.
[1:56:17.380 --> 1:56:18.380]  Here it is.
[1:56:18.380 --> 1:56:31.380]  Mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics. There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives and vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[1:56:31.380 --> 1:56:38.380]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[1:56:38.380 --> 1:56:51.380]  But if you read the study, it just claimed, it wasn't even related to that. It was pure deception. Up on the screen, I have TMZ with a crazy looking screenshot of Charlie, like he's bad.
[1:56:51.380 --> 1:56:55.380]  I mean, this is so insane. Give out the organization's website again.
[1:56:55.380 --> 1:57:04.380]  www.nvic.org or standupbcounted.org.
[1:57:04.380 --> 1:57:07.380]  In the minute we've got left, any other key points that need to be added, Barbara?
[1:57:07.380 --> 1:57:15.380]  Well, on the mercury issue, I mean, it kills brain cells. Aluminum that's in vaccine is also known to kill brain cells.
[1:57:15.380 --> 1:57:23.380]  I mean, that's just known in the medical literature. So for someone to stand up and say that mercury is good for you is just ridiculous.
[1:57:23.380 --> 1:57:32.380]  People need to get educated about these vaccines and not assume they're like taking a drink of water. They have profound effects on brain and immune function.
[1:57:32.380 --> 1:57:36.380]  And so they need to get educated and then make an informed decision.
[1:57:36.380 --> 1:57:44.380]  In the past, when they only wanted to take a few dozen vaccines, they could buffalo people and lie and say they had to take it now that it's 60 plus shots and then it'll be 100 the next year.
[1:57:44.380 --> 1:57:53.380]  As you said, the people are finally saying no. So now the government's trying to come in with actual laws to forcibly medicate people with deadly poisons.
[1:57:53.380 --> 1:57:59.380]  And we just salute you and your organization. I would imagine, is your group growing like never before?
[1:57:59.380 --> 1:58:13.380]  Our website is getting more than a million hits now a year. I mean, we're growing. Yeah, a lot of people, if you go on Google search and Google a vaccine copy like vaccine information, we come up number one or two, our website and the blog that I have.
[1:58:13.380 --> 1:58:23.380]  So I would really encourage people to not stick their heads in the sand. Don't believe everything your doctor tells you. Check it out for yourself. Stand up for your rights.
[1:58:23.380 --> 1:58:24.380]  All right.
[1:58:24.380 --> 1:58:26.380]  Okay. Thank you so much.
[1:58:26.380 --> 1:58:31.380]  Barbara Lowe Fisher will talk to you soon.
[1:58:31.380 --> 1:58:40.380]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:40.380 --> 1:58:45.380]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[1:58:45.380 --> 1:58:50.380]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:58:50.380 --> 1:58:56.380]  It's known as the Builder Bird. Both their objective being world domination.
[1:58:56.380 --> 1:59:09.380]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:59:09.380 --> 1:59:19.380]  For the first time in history, the elites plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[1:59:19.380 --> 1:59:21.380]  Great progress for the world government.
[1:59:21.380 --> 1:59:26.380]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their affidavit.
[1:59:26.380 --> 1:59:35.380]  Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:59:35.380 --> 1:59:50.380]  In-game blueprint for global enslaved. You have been warned.
[1:59:50.380 --> 2:00:14.380]  Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:14.380 --> 2:00:26.380]  Well, for the next 20 minutes, we have presidential candidate running as an independent, not as a green this time. Ralph Nader, famous anti-corruption consumer advocate.
[2:00:26.380 --> 2:00:38.380]  And he is with us now running for president. The Democrats could argue that, you know, it was bad for him to run as a green and maybe it made Al Gore lose or this or that or some other candidate.
[2:00:38.380 --> 2:00:47.380]  But in the final equation now, what difference is there with Barack Obama and John McCain? And we'll ask Ralph Nader his take on that.
[2:00:47.380 --> 2:00:54.380]  Talk about his campaign and what his party platform is running as an independent. Mr. Nader, thank you for spending time with us.
[2:00:54.380 --> 2:00:56.380]  Thank you, Alex. Thank you, listeners.
[2:00:56.380 --> 2:01:01.380]  What's most important for my listeners to know? And why are you running for president?
[2:01:01.380 --> 2:01:17.380]  Well, we need someone who has stood for the people and not for big business and their government minions in Washington. And it's quite clear after working here for so many years that every department agency in Washington, D.C. is overwhelmingly controlled by corporate power.
[2:01:17.380 --> 2:01:27.380]  The big banks and financial institutions control department treasury and the Federal Reserve. The big defense manufacturers control the Department of Defense more than the people.
[2:01:27.380 --> 2:01:39.380]  There's not much left for people to decide anymore, Alex. Not much left at all. The Constitution still starts with we the people. But the way the judges are reading it, it sounds more like we the corporation.
[2:01:39.380 --> 2:01:50.380]  So on our website, VoteNader.org. And I really urge you to connect with that vibrant website from time to time, folks. And also, regardless of where you're going to vote or who you're going to vote for,
[2:01:50.380 --> 2:02:03.380]  log into our email at votenader.org and you'll get regular missives and announcements. It gives you a different take than the mainstream media does on the presidential campaign.
[2:02:03.380 --> 2:02:21.380]  The thing is, people who believe the taxpayer dollar is a sacred trust have got to challenge the waste in Washington. And the biggest waste is in that bloated wasteful military budget that now takes one half of the federal government's
[2:02:21.380 --> 2:02:36.380]  completely operating expenditures. And there's no more Soviet Union. So it's obviously a huge contract bonanza for these big defense companies whose lobbies swarm over Washington, whose political acting committees cash register politics,
[2:02:36.380 --> 2:02:44.380]  and as executives go into the Pentagon, telling generals and admirals what they can do at the top.
[2:02:44.380 --> 2:02:55.380]  Senator, I want to go back to what you first said, describing how global corporations have come in and taken over the decision making process of government to where government is just their vehicle.
[2:02:55.380 --> 2:02:59.380]  How would you describe that system? Is that fascism?
[2:02:59.380 --> 2:03:10.380]  Yeah. Well, Franklin Roosevelt said it in 1938, a message to Congress. He said, when our government is taken over by private economic power, that's fascism. He used that exact words, Alex.
[2:03:10.380 --> 2:03:11.380]  What do you...
[2:03:11.380 --> 2:03:13.380]  And of course, it's never been worse.
[2:03:13.380 --> 2:03:15.380]  What do you have to do with this campaign?
[2:03:15.380 --> 2:03:29.380]  Well, look what we've got to do. First of all, these global trade agreements are more than trade agreements. They basically allow communists and fascist dictators abroad who receive the global corporations jobs and industries and
[2:03:29.380 --> 2:03:43.380]  pummel their workers down to 20, 30, 40 cents an hour, et cetera. They allow these fascist and communist regimes to pull down the standard of living for the American worker. That's what the whole point of NAFTA and WTO are.
[2:03:43.380 --> 2:03:54.380]  It's to open up very low-cost areas abroad, and these are dictatorially repressed costs. They are not market costs in places like China.
[2:03:54.380 --> 2:04:08.380]  And so they say, okay, we're open for business. So, you know, General Electric, General Motors, all these companies move their industries, lay off their workers, hollow communities in downtown USA, around the country, the
[2:04:08.380 --> 2:04:28.380]  electronics industry, the auto supply industry, you know, they're all moving over there. And then they use this hard-working Chinese labor at 30, 40, 50 cents an hour with modern capital equipment, ship the products back to the U.S. And in the meantime, workers and companies playing by the rules here can't compete.
[2:04:28.380 --> 2:04:40.380]  And not only that, but a lot of the food you're getting, especially a farm-bread fish, for example, from China is contaminated. The blood thinner heparin has just been documented to 120 deaths in America.
[2:04:40.380 --> 2:04:41.380]  Mr. Native.
[2:04:41.380 --> 2:04:43.380]  So we've got to turn this quite right around. We've got...
[2:04:43.380 --> 2:04:59.380]  Yes, sir. Got a break. Got a break. We're going to continue talking on the Internet side.
[2:05:34.380 --> 2:05:35.380]  Knowledge is power.
[2:05:35.380 --> 2:05:46.380]  And the information you need to effectively wake up your fellow man and fight the New World Order is available right now at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.tv. Join the Info War today.
[2:05:46.380 --> 2:06:01.380]  This is Steve Shank, J. Michael Stevens Group. Let's get real. Flour is already being rationed. Prices on food are getting so high, warehouses are installing security systems and guards. You can expect soon to see criminal activity in food.
[2:06:01.380 --> 2:06:13.380]  We're all in a foot race as to whether the food will become so expensive we can't afford it or there will be no food at any price. We can't grow enough of our own food even with genetically altered trash.
[2:06:13.380 --> 2:06:21.380]  It will give you the opportunity to eat perfectly engineered food. They think God didn't get it right, so Monsanto had to step in.
[2:06:21.380 --> 2:06:39.380]  If you think it's a little bit crazy to put in a supply of food, it's okay. We won't tell. Call 800-409-5633 on the web, efoodsdirect.com. That's 800-409-5633. It may be a little bit crazy. That's okay.
[2:06:39.380 --> 2:06:47.380]  Because there is no such thing as a little bit dead.
[2:06:47.380 --> 2:06:56.380]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap or detergent? How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes and more?
[2:06:56.380 --> 2:07:03.380]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic. Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[2:07:03.380 --> 2:07:12.380]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin and mucous membranes.

[2:08:30.380 --> 2:08:33.380]  Well, not only am I supportive, but about three weeks ago,
[2:08:33.380 --> 2:08:47.380]  I stood in front of the White House with a terrorist smilling around and made a 45-minute case for the impeachment of Bush Cheney or their resignation, the way Nixon and Agnew had to resign, or their subsequent prosecution once they leave office.
[2:08:47.380 --> 2:08:54.380]  I mean, there are at least five serious repeated daily high crimes and misdemeanors, as our Constitution puts it, for impeachment.
[2:08:54.380 --> 2:09:02.380]  One is a criminal war of aggression against Iraq based on a platform of lies, deceptions and cover-ups that have been hugely documented.
[2:09:02.380 --> 2:09:10.380]  The second is systemic torture that violates the U.S. Army Field Manual, federal statutes, our Constitution and the Geneva Conventions.
[2:09:10.380 --> 2:09:19.380]  The third is arresting thousands of Americans and throwing them in jail without preferring charges and allowing them to have attorneys.
[2:09:19.380 --> 2:09:36.380]  Excuse me. The fourth is the spying on thousands of Americans whose push is admitted more than once without a judicial warrant. That's a five-year jail term, first class felony under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
[2:09:36.380 --> 2:09:50.380]  And the fifth is this outlaw president, this King George IV, has had 800 signing statements, signing bills enacted by Congress, and he basically says, I'll decide whether or not I'm going to obey them.
[2:09:50.380 --> 2:09:56.380]  And that's more signing statements than all the presidents from George Washington to Clinton put together.
[2:09:56.380 --> 2:10:07.380]  So all five, and they go on every day, they're not like Alex Johnson, not like a one-time Watergate situation, not like lying under oaths about sex involving Clinton for which he was impeached.
[2:10:07.380 --> 2:10:14.380]  And I think we should all support Dennis Kucinich. You notice that the mainstream media has pretty much blacked them out.
[2:10:14.380 --> 2:10:24.380]  And here he is, an upstanding member of the House, right on the House floor, and they got reporters all over the place and suddenly they put away their pens, huh?
[2:10:24.380 --> 2:10:35.380]  So it is important to get Chairman John Conyers and Speaker Nancy Pelosi to hold this President and Vice President accountable for their high crimes and misdemeanors.
[2:10:35.380 --> 2:10:44.380]  You know, Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, put it very well the other day. He said, quote, we tried a monarchy once, but it didn't work.
[2:10:44.380 --> 2:10:51.380]  Ralph Nader, Ralph Nader presidential candidate, is our guest. We'll tell you about the websites and the campaign before he leaves us hearing about it.
[2:10:51.380 --> 2:11:06.380]  Alex, just to finish, I was up in Kennebunkport where the Bushes have their palatial estate, and I made the same point on impeachment, and that's up on our website, votenader.org.
[2:11:06.380 --> 2:11:15.380]  Anybody who wants to see that statement across the Cove from the Bush family compound can look up votenader.org.
[2:11:15.380 --> 2:11:17.380]  It's been getting a lot of attention.
[2:11:17.380 --> 2:11:19.380]  Mr. Nader, I've got to ask you a list of questions here.
[2:11:19.380 --> 2:11:25.380]  First off, you've been around a long time. You've seen a lot of corruption, one of the foremost corruption fighters out there, and we support you in that.
[2:11:25.380 --> 2:11:32.380]  But, you know, in your life studying this and seeing different personalities, I mean, here's just one small, tiny example.
[2:11:32.380 --> 2:11:38.380]  You have John McCain goes over to England. He has hundreds of donors to a campaign dinner. None of them are U.S. citizens.
[2:11:38.380 --> 2:11:43.380]  They admit it's all felonies. The London Guardian and AP report on it, but no other press.
[2:11:43.380 --> 2:11:51.380]  And John McCain just says, I don't care. I'll commit crimes if I want to. We have the White House memos with Gonzalez and you saying they can torture children with pliers.
[2:11:51.380 --> 2:11:58.380]  I mean, what has happened? It's more than just corruption. It's like insanity. Like, they're trying to break every rule.
[2:11:58.380 --> 2:12:03.380]  They're trying. Even the Nazis didn't admit they tortured people. They just did it in secret.
[2:12:03.380 --> 2:12:09.380]  I mean, the mindset of these people, I'm worried they may stage a vent. They may start another war with Iran.
[2:12:09.380 --> 2:12:14.380]  I mean, they're building FEMA camps. That's now in the newspapers. They're setting up private death squads.
[2:12:14.380 --> 2:12:23.380]  I mean, can you just speak to what we've seen? I mean, not just the Articles of Impeachment, but just the total lawlessness and why you think they're doing it,
[2:12:23.380 --> 2:12:26.380]  because there's got to be some method to this, or is it just total megalomania?
[2:12:26.380 --> 2:12:33.380]  Lawlessness is the right word. This is an outlaw presidency. This is the president thinks he's above the law, beyond the law.
[2:12:33.380 --> 2:12:41.380]  He can do anything he wants. He can arrest and throw in prison anybody he wants. He can invade and attack any country in the world that he wants.
[2:12:41.380 --> 2:12:47.380]  And he effectively said that. And he can violate any constitutional provision or federal law that he wants.
[2:12:47.380 --> 2:12:51.380]  Now, how does he get away with it? Because there's no opposition party to speak of.
[2:12:51.380 --> 2:12:58.380]  The Democratic Party have just lain down on the job. They control Congress, but they refuse to have impeachment hearings.
[2:12:58.380 --> 2:13:05.380]  They even refuse to have hearings on the constitutional and statutory crimes of the Bush Cheney regime.
[2:13:05.380 --> 2:13:17.380]  And I notice a real tone of urgency in your voice, Alec, and it's well-merited, because this is a subversion of everything our founding fathers ever dreamed of for our country.
[2:13:17.380 --> 2:13:24.380]  And we've got to do something about it. We've got to contact our senators and representatives, and when they come home in August,
[2:13:24.380 --> 2:13:30.380]  I mean, surround their auditoriums with protesters and say, you've got to do something. Don't tell us that.
[2:13:30.380 --> 2:13:35.380]  Well, and then the police, then the police show up and say no protest allowed.
[2:13:35.380 --> 2:13:42.380]  Activists being arrested everywhere, building more prisons everywhere. I mean, it looks like this regime backed up by the corporations is going for broke.
[2:13:42.380 --> 2:13:45.380]  What do you think their in game is?
[2:13:45.380 --> 2:13:57.380]  Well, I mean, their in game is basically corporate fascism. That's what it is. The merger of government and big business for criminal purposes.
[2:13:57.380 --> 2:14:09.380]  And you'll notice that on our website, one of the issues on our table there off the table for Obama McCain is an aggressive crackdown on corporate crime and corporate subsidies of the taxpayer dollar.
[2:14:09.380 --> 2:14:17.380]  And you know, this corporate crime has looted and drained millions of pensions of workers, small investors, laid off workers, nobody's working for Enron anymore.
[2:14:17.380 --> 2:14:22.380]  Wall Street is a hotbed of crookery and crime, and you've got a war criminal in the White House.
[2:14:22.380 --> 2:14:23.380]  Oh my God.
[2:14:23.380 --> 2:14:28.380]  The shocking thing of it is, Alec, is how much are the American people going to take?
[2:14:28.380 --> 2:14:36.380]  Well, that's my point, sir, is that they look like they're accelerating it, and I'm worried that they'll even leave office.
[2:14:36.380 --> 2:14:38.380]  I mean, are you worried they might stage something?
[2:14:38.380 --> 2:14:45.380]  I'm worried they might attack Iran. Yeah, I mean, that's it. You know, that way he shuts up the press, most of the press.
[2:14:45.380 --> 2:14:51.380]  He chills out the Democrats. He stifles dissent and concentrates more power in his hands.
[2:14:51.380 --> 2:15:00.380]  I think the hope for the country are these retired generals, admirals, national security types, the diplomats who have spoken out against the war,
[2:15:00.380 --> 2:15:09.380]  but they haven't organized into a powerful lobby against the war, against this kind of criminality, although when you talk to them, when you read their op-eds and their statements,
[2:15:09.380 --> 2:15:17.380]  they're just terrific patriots, but one at a time doesn't do it. They've got to all organize, and that'll turn Congress around.
[2:15:17.380 --> 2:15:28.380]  Let me tell you, when you get all these heroes and patriots with the ribbons and where they've served all over the country, up against these draft dodgers called George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, it's no contest.
[2:15:28.380 --> 2:15:33.380]  Well, it is a going for broke, and you're right. There's all these great patriots fighting back against them.
[2:15:33.380 --> 2:15:41.380]  Shifting gears into another subject, GMO. I mean, I've had the scientists who worked at the companies where all the rats would die when they'd get feed them a potato over a few months,
[2:15:41.380 --> 2:15:47.380]  and then they put that on our table. I mean, again, it's like the corporations have gone insane. I don't mean your mom and Poppins listeners.
[2:15:47.380 --> 2:15:54.380]  I mean, the big fortune one, yeah, like Monsanto and others. What would you do as president against these GMOs?
[2:15:54.380 --> 2:16:11.380]  Well, first of all, suspend any further GMO foods in the marketplace. They are not labeled. 95% of American people, when they go into supermarket, they've said they want genetically modified foods and packages and elsewhere labeled.
[2:16:11.380 --> 2:16:18.380]  And Monsanto says no. The people say yes. Monsanto wins. The people lose. No democracy there.
[2:16:18.380 --> 2:16:30.380]  Also, there's a very good group in Cambridge started by Harvard and MIT scientists called Council for Responsible Genetics, and the website is genewatch.org.
[2:16:30.380 --> 2:16:37.380]  That's G-E-N-E, watch.org. You get good information there. There's been at least some progress.
[2:16:37.380 --> 2:16:46.380]  Congress about the ban of employers from deploying DNA information in order to decide whether a higher or a higher.
[2:16:46.380 --> 2:16:52.380]  Another issue, what about police all over the country under federal grants taking blood at checkpoints without warrants?
[2:16:52.380 --> 2:16:58.380]  There's body scanners going in the airports that literally scan your neck and body and save the images. What would you do to that?
[2:16:58.380 --> 2:17:05.380]  Well, I'd stop that because, first of all, there are some things in people's packages that these body scanners don't catch to begin with.
[2:17:05.380 --> 2:17:13.380]  And it's amazing how they want to have these body scanners, but the cargo is still very little examined of the passage.
[2:17:13.380 --> 2:17:22.380]  There are 100 on the cargo ships. I am closing Ralph Nader running for president. What is the strategy? How do we help force you into the debates?
[2:17:22.380 --> 2:17:31.380]  Well, Google, at their headquarters the other week, wants to do their own debates. You know, with YouTube, as they're subsidiary, they can pull it off.
[2:17:31.380 --> 2:17:37.380]  They want to start one in New Orleans, and they can deliver an audience that doesn't rely on NBC, ABC, and CBS. That's one.
[2:17:37.380 --> 2:17:45.380]  And the second is, really protest this debate commission. You can get the way to protest, go to the website, opendebates.org.
[2:17:45.380 --> 2:17:46.380]  Opendebates.org.
[2:17:46.380 --> 2:17:54.380]  Yeah, and you ought to have this guy, George Farron, your program. He's the expert critic, Harvard Law grad. He's the expert critic on the debate.
[2:17:54.380 --> 2:17:58.380]  Yeah, we have these private corporate hijackings of the process. Hey, listen, here's an idea, and I'm sure you've thought of it.
[2:17:58.380 --> 2:18:07.380]  Even if ABC, CBS, Fox won't let you in the debates, how about we have the real third party, the real independents, have a real Google debate, even if they won't show up?
[2:18:07.380 --> 2:18:15.380]  Exactly, and have empty chairs where these cowards are afraid to show up. Other Western countries have five, six people on the debates.
[2:18:15.380 --> 2:18:19.380]  These guys want it all to themselves, and they own the corporation.
[2:18:19.380 --> 2:18:23.380]  Ralph Nader, one minute closing statement. We're out of time, sir.
[2:18:23.380 --> 2:18:35.380]  All right. For 40 years, I've worked for the American people. You've got safer cars, and we've had drinking water, safety food, safety free information, so you know what's going on.
[2:18:35.380 --> 2:18:42.380]  You can sue the government to get information. We're opposed to subsidies, handouts, giveaways, and your tax dollars to corporations.
[2:18:42.380 --> 2:18:54.380]  We want to put the corporate crime wave under the rule of law and prosecute these crooks, business crooks, put them in jail. After they're convicted, it'll improve prison conditions.
[2:18:54.380 --> 2:19:05.380]  We want to reverse U.S. policy in the Middle East, impeach Bush and Cheney, repeal anti-union laws, adopt a security speculation tax on Wall Street so they can reduce taxes on you as a worker,
[2:19:05.380 --> 2:19:15.380]  put an end to the ballot access obstructionism that keeps dissent from getting into the arena, and dissent is the mother of all us, then.
[2:19:15.380 --> 2:19:22.380]  And open up the question is, why do corporations as artificial entities have the same constitutional rights as you real people do?
[2:19:22.380 --> 2:19:28.380]  And if they continue to do that, there's no such thing as equal justice under the law between you and ExxonMobil.
[2:19:28.380 --> 2:19:40.380]  So log in to votenator.org, sign on to our email list right away, and you will get a real refreshing view of what this presidential race should be all about.
[2:19:40.380 --> 2:19:44.380]  Presidential candidate Ralph Nader, thanks for joining us. Will you check back in when this is just develops?
[2:19:44.380 --> 2:19:47.380]  We'll do, miss you since I saw you at Crawford the other day.
[2:19:47.380 --> 2:20:01.380]  Take care, sir. Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in Internet history comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[2:20:01.380 --> 2:20:12.380]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions, and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[2:20:12.380 --> 2:20:23.380]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose. From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases, to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[2:20:39.380 --> 2:20:47.380]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war. Truth is our weapon, and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[2:20:47.380 --> 2:20:54.380]  Hello, Ted Anderson. Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[2:20:54.380 --> 2:21:02.380]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[2:21:02.380 --> 2:21:15.380]  The Federal Reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal. Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run, followed by a depressed economy.
[2:21:15.380 --> 2:21:26.380]  A current effort is underway by the Fed, along with other central banks, to increase liquidity for depositors. However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation.
[2:21:26.380 --> 2:21:33.380]  With strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[2:21:33.380 --> 2:21:40.380]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[2:21:40.380 --> 2:21:47.380]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237. That's 1-800-686-2237.
[2:21:47.380 --> 2:21:57.380]  If your body isn't feeling too well these days, you're going to start taking this hemp, I say, go to hempusa.org.
[2:21:57.380 --> 2:22:07.380]  You may not like what I'm about to say, but you know I'm going to say it anyway. The government doesn't want the best for you. They keep you down. They keep you blue.
[2:22:07.380 --> 2:22:12.380]  They starve your body for all its nutrients.
[2:22:12.380 --> 2:22:21.380]  If you want to let your grow industrial hemp, it really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[2:22:21.380 --> 2:22:31.380]  I hope Mr. Busch will hear this song for the heart of America wants this one. Go to hempusa.org.
[2:22:31.380 --> 2:22:40.380]  If you're a true thur and anarchist or renegade, you only want things that God has made. Go to hempusa.org.

[2:33:04.380 --> 2:33:20.380]  His big hands, I recall, impressed me most of all when Dad was around.
[2:33:20.380 --> 2:33:46.380]  Doin' the chores, gettin' fangs at the stores, a huntin' fishin' as five than eleven. His big hands in those days showed me all of his ways, oh when Dad was around.
[2:33:46.380 --> 2:34:12.380]  From twelve to twenty, we were happy had twenty when Dad was around. His big hands were still guiding in each other confiding when Dad was around.
[2:34:12.380 --> 2:34:20.380]  We had to find the people who were doing this, take them out and shoot them.
[2:34:20.380 --> 2:34:30.380]  Really, just find the people who are sending those later to our troops to demoralize our troops and do what they're doing. You take them out, they are traitors of this country and shoot them.
[2:34:30.380 --> 2:34:41.380]  You have a problem with that? Deal with it. But anybody who would do that doesn't deserve to live. You shoot them. You call them traitors, that's what they are.
[2:34:41.380 --> 2:34:47.380]  And you shoot them dead. I'll pay for the bullet.
[2:34:47.380 --> 2:35:00.380]  Mark Dice, the founder of The Resistance, which he calls a media watchdog group, says that the U.S. government was responsible for the September 11 terrorist attacks and that the armed forces should know it.
[2:35:00.380 --> 2:35:11.380]  People want the facts, the Marines are hungry for the truth, what got them there in Iraq, why are they risking their lives and we're going to help them understand that.
[2:35:11.380 --> 2:35:25.380]  So he's going to send letters and declassify government documents that he says can prove the government's responsibility for the terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people and he's urging others to do the same.
[2:35:25.380 --> 2:35:33.380]  Now, Captain Pete Hexeth, executive director of Vets for Freedom, you ought to get him on too, Brad.
[2:35:33.380 --> 2:35:34.380]  I'm on it.
[2:35:34.380 --> 2:35:45.380]  It says, you know something, these are going to end up in the trash or they're going to end up in the toilet or they're going to end up on the firing range.
[2:35:45.380 --> 2:35:56.380]  How about you take Mark Dice out and put him in the middle of the firing range, tie him to a post, don't blindfold him, let it rip and have some fun with Mark Dice.
[2:35:56.380 --> 2:35:59.380]  These people are just folks, I'm telling you, outrageous.
[2:35:59.380 --> 2:36:02.380]  Now we know where the Ron Paul supporters went.
[2:36:02.380 --> 2:36:03.380]  All right.
[2:36:03.380 --> 2:36:06.380]  Now that is who is outrageous.
[2:36:06.380 --> 2:36:09.380]  Who you were just hearing there is who is outrageous.
[2:36:09.380 --> 2:36:18.380]  We have a constitutional right to the First Amendment, we had We Are Change arrested and ticketed in Denver for on the streets of Denver handing out DVDs yesterday.
[2:36:18.380 --> 2:36:20.380]  We're going to be getting them on Sunday.
[2:36:20.380 --> 2:36:24.380]  We had We Are Change videotaping outside a event with Colin Powell.
[2:36:24.380 --> 2:36:28.380]  They arrested them and charged them with trespassing for being on the city sidewalk.
[2:36:28.380 --> 2:36:32.380]  They are openly calling to put us in camps, beat us, send us to secret camps.
[2:36:32.380 --> 2:36:35.380]  They said that on the morning, Joe with Joe Scarborough.
[2:36:35.380 --> 2:36:38.380]  These are serious people, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:36:38.380 --> 2:36:43.380]  They are trying to say that we're involved in bombings and terrorism, just making it up.
[2:36:43.380 --> 2:36:47.380]  Mark Dice had the great idea earlier this week.
[2:36:47.380 --> 2:36:53.380]  And Fox had the headline, 9-11 truthers go postal.
[2:36:53.380 --> 2:36:59.380]  And then it went to say we want to mail them to the post office, but the headline implies we're killing people while they say they want to kill us.
[2:36:59.380 --> 2:37:07.380]  Mark, you have to take legal action on Michael Reagan because this is what the Nazis did the first few years beating people up, calling for violence, saying we should be killed.
[2:37:07.380 --> 2:37:13.380]  I mean, he's the guy with the party who helped destroy the borders, who helped triple the size of government.
[2:37:13.380 --> 2:37:14.380]  They're not conservatives.
[2:37:14.380 --> 2:37:15.380]  They lied to us.
[2:37:15.380 --> 2:37:18.380]  We know the Republican memos say they want more 9-11s.
[2:37:18.380 --> 2:37:20.380]  They wanted 9-11 before it happened.
[2:37:20.380 --> 2:37:23.380]  PNAC said September 2000, rebuilding America's defenses.
[2:37:23.380 --> 2:37:25.380]  You're getting all these threats.
[2:37:25.380 --> 2:37:26.380]  I'm getting threats.
[2:37:26.380 --> 2:37:28.380]  And this guy is on hundreds of stations.
[2:37:28.380 --> 2:37:30.380]  I know he's on San Antonio right here.
[2:37:30.380 --> 2:37:34.380]  We can hear him in Austin calling for your murder.
[2:37:34.380 --> 2:37:37.380]  I mean, there's no doubt that they want tyranny in this country.
[2:37:37.380 --> 2:37:39.380]  Mark Dice, what was it like for you to learn of this?
[2:37:39.380 --> 2:37:40.380]  Pretty shocking.
[2:37:40.380 --> 2:37:43.380]  I actually contacted the FBI, filed a report with them.
[2:37:43.380 --> 2:37:50.380]  The agent on the case got back with me shortly after asking me to forward the death threats that I've been getting in the email.
[2:37:50.380 --> 2:37:52.380]  I've contacted the FCC.
[2:37:52.380 --> 2:37:59.380]  I've sent out a press release to every major news agency about this, demanding that he be fired and legal action be taken.
[2:37:59.380 --> 2:38:05.380]  You can go to markdice.com and get a copy of the press release and just want to ask everybody to send it out to all the media.
[2:38:05.380 --> 2:38:06.380]  This is completely unacceptable.
[2:38:06.380 --> 2:38:08.380]  This is beyond the pale.
[2:38:08.380 --> 2:38:10.380]  He's more than crossed the line.
[2:38:10.380 --> 2:38:12.380]  They are the terrorists.
[2:38:12.380 --> 2:38:15.380]  And I'm going to pursue as much legal action as I can.
[2:38:15.380 --> 2:38:20.380]  Well, there's a lot of weak-minded and nutcases that love the New World Order, and they may kill you.
[2:38:20.380 --> 2:38:25.380]  I mean, they may take a shot at you, Mark, and then that son of a bitch is definitely going to go to prison.
[2:38:25.380 --> 2:38:29.380]  And not only that, he wants to pay for the bullet, too.
[2:38:29.380 --> 2:38:30.380]  He is calling for murder.
[2:38:30.380 --> 2:38:33.380]  He contracted murder on air.
[2:38:33.380 --> 2:38:34.380]  And we got the whole tape.
[2:38:34.380 --> 2:38:36.380]  He didn't say it was a joke.
[2:38:36.380 --> 2:38:37.380]  He called.
[2:38:37.380 --> 2:38:39.380]  He solicited murder.
[2:38:39.380 --> 2:38:42.380]  He solicited premeditated capital murder.
[2:38:42.380 --> 2:38:44.380]  I hope you put that in your press release.
[2:38:44.380 --> 2:38:45.380]  In fact, that's the headline.
[2:38:45.380 --> 2:38:46.380]  We should have it, infowars.com.
[2:38:46.380 --> 2:38:47.380]  I know there's some stories.
[2:38:47.380 --> 2:38:49.380]  Kurt Nemo's already gotten up there.
[2:38:49.380 --> 2:38:53.380]  But Michael Reagan, son of the president, contracts for murder on air.
[2:38:53.380 --> 2:38:54.380]  He was serious.
[2:38:54.380 --> 2:38:59.380]  He called for your murder three separate times and offered to pay for it.
[2:38:59.380 --> 2:39:00.380]  Yeah.
[2:39:00.380 --> 2:39:04.380]  Now, there's another talk show host, Amok, in a name that has called for the murder of judges in the past.
[2:39:04.380 --> 2:39:06.380]  And people have went out.
[2:39:06.380 --> 2:39:08.380]  His listeners have went out and murdered them.
[2:39:08.380 --> 2:39:11.380]  This is very serious, which is why I contacted the FBI.
[2:39:11.380 --> 2:39:15.380]  And we're going to do everything that we can to take all the legal recourse against this.
[2:39:15.380 --> 2:39:19.380]  This is very sad, very shocking.
[2:39:19.380 --> 2:39:21.380]  They've crossed a new line here now.
[2:39:21.380 --> 2:39:23.380]  No, no, they're desperate.
[2:39:23.380 --> 2:39:28.380]  My family's getting threats after they tried to call my wife as I was leaving Bilderberg
[2:39:28.380 --> 2:39:32.380]  and say that I'd gotten a woman pregnant and, of course, was made up to freak her out.
[2:39:32.380 --> 2:39:35.380]  Then stuff about burning my house down, going after my children.
[2:39:35.380 --> 2:39:38.380]  I mean, these are the scum of the earth.
[2:39:38.380 --> 2:39:41.380]  And even if it's not a government job, by putting the word out there,
[2:39:41.380 --> 2:39:44.380]  by encouraging that some psycho, some mentally unstable person,
[2:39:44.380 --> 2:39:48.380]  what they're hoping is will track us down and do their dirty work for them.
[2:39:48.380 --> 2:39:49.380]  And he needs to be held accountable.
[2:39:49.380 --> 2:39:53.380]  I'll keep everybody informed on what's going on with the case here.
[2:39:53.380 --> 2:39:57.380]  And please go to markdice.com, get the press release that I have posted there.
[2:39:57.380 --> 2:40:02.380]  It has a link to his statements in there and email it to all the major media institutions.
[2:40:02.380 --> 2:40:04.380]  Let's get this man fired.
[2:40:04.380 --> 2:40:06.380]  Well, I want to say this to everybody out there.
[2:40:06.380 --> 2:40:09.380]  I got a Second Amendment right to defend myself and my family.
[2:40:09.380 --> 2:40:11.380]  And so I'm going to put the warning out.
[2:40:11.380 --> 2:40:14.380]  When we go to events, we have off-duty police officers there.
[2:40:14.380 --> 2:40:16.380]  I've never told anybody that before.
[2:40:16.380 --> 2:40:19.380]  And I just want people to understand something. We have concealed carry permit people.
[2:40:19.380 --> 2:40:21.380]  And we are not going to put up people's crap.
[2:40:21.380 --> 2:40:23.380]  We will defend ourselves 110%.
[2:40:23.380 --> 2:40:24.380]  Mark, what about you?
[2:40:24.380 --> 2:40:27.380]  Listen, I'm six foot three. I'm 210 pounds.
[2:40:27.380 --> 2:40:30.380]  I'm trained in martial arts. I have firearms.
[2:40:30.380 --> 2:40:35.380]  I will take all the legal duties to defend myself and my family and my property.
[2:40:35.380 --> 2:40:37.380]  And they demonize the Black Panthers. That's all they said.
[2:40:37.380 --> 2:40:39.380]  They said we will protect ourselves.
[2:40:39.380 --> 2:40:41.380]  This is strictly in self-defense.
[2:40:41.380 --> 2:40:43.380]  We're not an offensive movement.
[2:40:43.380 --> 2:40:48.380]  This is an information outreach. And now they're threatening us with contract killings, with murder.
[2:40:48.380 --> 2:40:50.380]  This is just absolutely ridiculous.
[2:40:50.380 --> 2:40:52.380]  I don't even know what else to say.
[2:40:52.380 --> 2:40:53.380]  I'm just so pissed.
[2:40:53.380 --> 2:40:56.380]  I'm trying not to just yell on the phone and get out of control.
[2:40:56.380 --> 2:40:57.380]  No, go ahead. Get out of control.
[2:40:57.380 --> 2:41:00.380]  What's going to take to get this country back?
[2:41:00.380 --> 2:41:01.380]  Oh, I know, man.
[2:41:01.380 --> 2:41:05.380]  You know, I put the phone number for his network, for his studio on there.
[2:41:05.380 --> 2:41:06.380]  I want everybody to call that.
[2:41:06.380 --> 2:41:08.380]  There's an email link to the FCC.
[2:41:08.380 --> 2:41:10.380]  You can file a complaint with him.
[2:41:10.380 --> 2:41:15.380]  I have information for the date of the broadcast and just include maybe my press release.
[2:41:15.380 --> 2:41:16.380]  Yeah, when was the date of this?
[2:41:16.380 --> 2:41:17.380]  Was this yesterday?
[2:41:17.380 --> 2:41:23.380]  This was Tuesday, June 10th, during the second hour of his program, which is nationally syndicated.
[2:41:23.380 --> 2:41:24.380]  I believe he has millions of listeners.
[2:41:24.380 --> 2:41:26.380]  This is a talking head that's been on Fox News.
[2:41:26.380 --> 2:41:29.380]  He's the adopted son of Ronald Reagan.
[2:41:29.380 --> 2:41:31.380]  And well, you know, I don't know much about Ronald Reagan.
[2:41:31.380 --> 2:41:34.380]  We know he was involved with Iran Contra and the Bohemian Grove.
[2:41:34.380 --> 2:41:39.380]  But his contract killings were at least done in private.
[2:41:39.380 --> 2:41:40.380]  Well, we're not going to put up with this.
[2:41:40.380 --> 2:41:42.380]  He needs to be arrested immediately.
[2:41:42.380 --> 2:41:45.380]  And it's time for these terrorists to be brought to justice.
[2:41:45.380 --> 2:41:48.380]  How dare them threaten my wife and my children?
[2:41:48.380 --> 2:41:49.380]  How dare them do this?
[2:41:49.380 --> 2:41:51.380]  How dare them do this to you, Mark?
[2:41:51.380 --> 2:41:55.380]  The agent that I talked to, I mean, we know that there's corrupt elements within the FBI,
[2:41:55.380 --> 2:41:56.380]  but they do a lot of good work.
[2:41:56.380 --> 2:42:01.380]  They do a lot of legitimate investigations, same with the police and the military.
[2:42:01.380 --> 2:42:06.380]  And so we can only hope that the agents on this case are legitimate and are going to fight for the Constitution.
[2:42:06.380 --> 2:42:08.380]  They're going to fight for my civil rights.
[2:42:08.380 --> 2:42:13.380]  They're going to hold Michael Reagan fully responsible.
[2:42:13.380 --> 2:42:16.380]  In case there's any questions about it, tell us in a minute.
[2:42:16.380 --> 2:42:17.380]  Let's just play the whole clip right now.
[2:42:17.380 --> 2:42:18.380]  Go ahead and roll it.
[2:42:18.380 --> 2:42:19.380]  It's about two minutes.
[2:42:19.380 --> 2:42:20.380]  Here it is.
[2:42:20.380 --> 2:42:27.380]  This is the contract killing, the call for a contract killing, soliciting capital murder to...
[2:42:27.380 --> 2:42:28.380]  He's in the top 10.
[2:42:28.380 --> 2:42:32.380]  He's the ninth-largest host in the country, rated at four million listeners per day.
[2:42:32.380 --> 2:42:37.380]  This is four million people hearing for the contract murder of Mark Dice for engaging in the First Amendment.
[2:42:37.380 --> 2:42:42.380]  We ought to find the people who are doing this, take them out and shoot them.
[2:42:42.380 --> 2:42:49.380]  Really, just find the people who are sending those later to our troops to demoralize our troops and do what they're doing.
[2:42:49.380 --> 2:42:50.380]  You take them out.
[2:42:50.380 --> 2:42:53.380]  They are traitors of this country and shoot them.
[2:42:53.380 --> 2:42:55.380]  You have a problem with that?
[2:42:55.380 --> 2:42:57.380]  Deal with it.
[2:42:57.380 --> 2:43:01.380]  But anybody who would do that doesn't deserve to live.
[2:43:01.380 --> 2:43:02.380]  You shoot them.
[2:43:02.380 --> 2:43:03.380]  You call them traitors.
[2:43:03.380 --> 2:43:04.380]  That's what they are.
[2:43:04.380 --> 2:43:07.380]  And you shoot them dead.
[2:43:07.380 --> 2:43:10.380]  I'll pay for the bullet.
[2:43:10.380 --> 2:43:18.380]  Mark Dice, the founder of The Resistance, which he calls a media watchdog group, says that the U.S.
[2:43:18.380 --> 2:43:23.380]  government was responsible for the September 11 terrorist attacks and that the armed forces should know it.
[2:43:23.380 --> 2:43:25.380]  People want the facts.
[2:43:25.380 --> 2:43:27.380]  The Marines are hungry for the truth.
[2:43:27.380 --> 2:43:29.380]  What got them there in Iraq?
[2:43:29.380 --> 2:43:35.380]  Why are they risking their lives and we're going to help them understand that?
[2:43:35.380 --> 2:43:46.380]  So he's going to send letters and declassify government documents that he says can prove the government's responsibility for the terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people.
[2:43:46.380 --> 2:43:49.380]  And he's urging others to do the same.
[2:43:49.380 --> 2:43:56.380]  Now, Captain Pete Hexeth, executive director of Vets for Freedom, you ought to get him on too, Brad.
[2:43:56.380 --> 2:43:58.380]  I'm on it.
[2:43:58.380 --> 2:44:00.380]  Well, it says, you know something?
[2:44:00.380 --> 2:44:09.380]  These are going to end up in the trash or they're going to end up in the toilet or they're going to end up on the firing range.
[2:44:09.380 --> 2:44:14.380]  How about you take Mark Dice out and put him in the middle of the firing range?
[2:44:14.380 --> 2:44:15.380]  Time to abose.
[2:44:15.380 --> 2:44:16.380]  Post.
[2:44:16.380 --> 2:44:17.380]  Don't blindfold him.
[2:44:17.380 --> 2:44:20.380]  Let it rip and have some fun with Mark Dice.
[2:44:20.380 --> 2:44:22.380]  These people are just folks.
[2:44:22.380 --> 2:44:23.380]  I'm telling you outrageous.
[2:44:23.380 --> 2:44:25.380]  Now we know where the Ron Paul supporters went.
[2:44:25.380 --> 2:44:27.380]  Oh, my God.
[2:44:27.380 --> 2:44:29.380]  That was a mean thing to say, Brad.
[2:44:29.380 --> 2:44:30.380]  That was a mean thing.
[2:44:30.380 --> 2:44:31.380]  I mean, that was the same.
[2:44:31.380 --> 2:44:32.380]  I'm sorry if I offended Mark.
[2:44:32.380 --> 2:44:34.380]  They hate real constitutionalists.
[2:44:34.380 --> 2:44:40.380]  You know, I also want to urge everybody too, for those who didn't know about the campaign, the operation and form the soldiers,
[2:44:40.380 --> 2:44:42.380]  information's on markdice.com about that.
[2:44:42.380 --> 2:44:47.380]  Yeah, this is only going to make us send out more now that they've engaged in this treason, this crime.
[2:44:47.380 --> 2:44:52.380]  You know, Mark, this is so amazing that he would seriously do this.
[2:44:52.380 --> 2:44:54.380]  And there's more at the first of it.
[2:44:54.380 --> 2:44:55.380]  There's more.
[2:44:55.380 --> 2:44:57.380]  There's more on infowars.com right now.
[2:44:57.380 --> 2:45:01.380]  It's up at markdice.com, theresistancemanifesto.com.
[2:45:01.380 --> 2:45:04.380]  People have to get behind you, Mark, and us, like never before.
[2:45:04.380 --> 2:45:11.380]  These sudden threats, these, you know, saying we should all go to FEMA camps, be tortured to death on MSNBC, on CNN, on Fox,
[2:45:11.380 --> 2:45:14.380]  saying we're criminals, we need to be arrested.
[2:45:14.380 --> 2:45:15.380]  I mean, we're hurting them.
[2:45:15.380 --> 2:45:18.380]  Make no mistake, listeners, it's you doing and getting the word out.
[2:45:18.380 --> 2:45:19.380]  They're getting desperate.
[2:45:19.380 --> 2:45:20.380]  Mark Dice, your take on that.
[2:45:20.380 --> 2:45:24.380]  You can hear the anger and the hatred in his voice, and everybody knows this.
[2:45:24.380 --> 2:45:29.380]  That's because they know that we know that the globalists did 9-11, and they've been defending this system,
[2:45:29.380 --> 2:45:31.380]  and they're getting scared they're going to go to prison.
[2:45:31.380 --> 2:45:35.380]  I was on the biggest talk show in Los Angeles, KFI 640 yesterday with Bill Handel,
[2:45:35.380 --> 2:45:39.380]  and he knew and he acknowledged that a third of the American people believe 9-11's an inside job.
[2:45:39.380 --> 2:45:41.380]  I believe that's a third as a few years ago.
[2:45:41.380 --> 2:45:42.380]  So we should all be shocked, though.
[2:45:42.380 --> 2:45:45.380]  36% of us believe total inside job, 84%.
[2:45:45.380 --> 2:45:48.380]  Angus and Reed, New York Times poll believe they may have carried it out.
[2:45:48.380 --> 2:45:50.380]  84% of us need to be killed.
[2:45:50.380 --> 2:45:54.380]  Listen, if you don't want to spend the money to send the troops letters and DVDs,
[2:45:54.380 --> 2:45:57.380]  there's also programs where you can email the troops, which is free.
[2:45:57.380 --> 2:46:01.380]  Go to my press release, and there's a couple websites on there where you can sign up for free
[2:46:01.380 --> 2:46:04.380]  and email back and forth with the troops, and let's email them links.
[2:46:04.380 --> 2:46:09.380]  And they're going to put spooks on trying to stop those, so send it under other names, other places,
[2:46:09.380 --> 2:46:11.380]  but also do it through churches.
[2:46:11.380 --> 2:46:14.380]  There's thousands of groups doing this so that they can't coordinate stopping us,
[2:46:14.380 --> 2:46:19.380]  and they're worried because tyranny comes to your door in the form of a uniform or as military or police.
[2:46:19.380 --> 2:46:22.380]  If we're able to wake all of them up, that's what Jack McClamm has been doing for 27 years,
[2:46:22.380 --> 2:46:24.380]  that is game over for them.
[2:46:24.380 --> 2:46:28.380]  I'm sending my material through a surrogate just because I'm sure that my name has been flagged,
[2:46:28.380 --> 2:46:31.380]  and any material that I send is probably not going to make it through.
[2:46:31.380 --> 2:46:37.380]  But if we get thousands of people to at least send emails with links and documents and YouTube videos,
[2:46:37.380 --> 2:46:41.380]  the troops will get it, they'll read it, and I'm sure that a lot of the troops are going to appreciate it
[2:46:41.380 --> 2:46:44.380]  and are going to send us back emails saying that they understand.
[2:46:44.380 --> 2:46:47.380]  I want to say something, Mark, to the military and police and the Cigar police
[2:46:47.380 --> 2:46:51.380]  that were following me in Virginia last week, admittedly, in the video we got out of it.
[2:46:51.380 --> 2:46:53.380]  You know the government's bad. You know you're doing wrong.
[2:46:53.380 --> 2:46:55.380]  You know torture of children's wrong and memos.
[2:46:55.380 --> 2:46:58.380]  You know the rape of women in front of their husbands is wrong.
[2:46:58.380 --> 2:47:02.380]  You know sniping families off the side of the road for target practice and laughing is wrong.
[2:47:02.380 --> 2:47:05.380]  You know calling for US citizens' murder is wrong.
[2:47:05.380 --> 2:47:09.380]  You know it's wrong. You know the pension funds being robbed are wrong.
[2:47:09.380 --> 2:47:12.380]  You know the NAU is wrong. You know the open borders are wrong.
[2:47:12.380 --> 2:47:15.380]  You know trillions missing from the Pentagon is wrong.
[2:47:15.380 --> 2:47:17.380]  You know you're in the wrong.
[2:47:17.380 --> 2:47:20.380]  And I want to tell people in the government engaged in crimes,
[2:47:20.380 --> 2:47:23.380]  if you won't join us, at least stand down and commit in crimes.
[2:47:23.380 --> 2:47:26.380]  Because Mark, I mean, he admittedly got White House talking points.
[2:47:26.380 --> 2:47:28.380]  He's one of the guys that goes to the White House and has those public meetings.
[2:47:28.380 --> 2:47:30.380]  This is a White House threat.
[2:47:30.380 --> 2:47:33.380]  This is we are going to kill you.
[2:47:33.380 --> 2:47:36.380]  And my whole point is we're committed. We're not stopping.
[2:47:36.380 --> 2:47:39.380]  I told people this week I felt the threshold go up to a whole new level.
[2:47:39.380 --> 2:47:43.380]  Mark, are you committed? You're never stopping. That's the key.
[2:47:43.380 --> 2:47:45.380]  And the world is changing.
[2:47:45.380 --> 2:47:47.380]  I don't think we're going to stop and do all that with those criminals.
[2:47:47.380 --> 2:47:49.380]  They can't stop us all.
[2:47:49.380 --> 2:47:51.380]  No, the can of worms I opened is out.
[2:47:51.380 --> 2:47:54.380]  My friends and family have your numbers, Alex and others.
[2:47:54.380 --> 2:47:56.380]  And if anything happens to me, they're going to contact you immediately.
[2:47:56.380 --> 2:47:59.380]  They also have other radio stations, other courses of action that will be taken.
[2:47:59.380 --> 2:48:01.380]  If anything happens. Any funny business.
[2:48:01.380 --> 2:48:04.380]  So they can't stop us.
[2:48:04.380 --> 2:48:07.380]  And they're getting so angry that their...
[2:48:07.380 --> 2:48:09.380]  I don't think that they know what to do.
[2:48:09.380 --> 2:48:11.380]  They're just speaking on the top of their head.
[2:48:11.380 --> 2:48:15.700]  When they threaten my family and other people, they change the rules of war, and they need
[2:48:15.700 --> 2:48:18.580]  to know that I'm on air telling everybody, don't be violent.
[2:48:18.580 --> 2:48:21.700]  They need to understand something happens to Mark Dye, something happens to you.
[2:48:21.700 --> 2:48:24.020]  This is a, maybe it's what they want is an escalation.
[2:48:24.020 --> 2:48:29.540]  But the whole point is, is that they're crossing lines that they shouldn't be crossing.
[2:48:29.540 --> 2:48:34.180]  And my God, Michael Reagan has really, I mean, coming out saying you need to be murdered,
[2:48:34.180 --> 2:48:37.780]  he better hope and pray civilly, criminally, and also with retribution.
[2:48:37.780 --> 2:48:40.460]  There's a lot of unstable people that listen to this show.
[2:48:40.460 --> 2:48:44.180]  I mean, there are hundreds of thousands of hardcore special ops, retired vets, people
[2:48:44.180 --> 2:48:49.020]  in there, and they are just, they know folks, and I'm a law abiding citizen, you're a law
[2:48:49.020 --> 2:48:50.020]  abiding citizen.
[2:48:50.020 --> 2:48:55.380]  We're, we're a nonviolent informational outreach, self-defense is our legal right.
[2:48:55.380 --> 2:48:59.780]  And if your life or somebody else's life is in immediate danger, you have the legal right
[2:48:59.780 --> 2:49:03.740]  to take the course of action that will protect that individual, even if that results in the
[2:49:03.740 --> 2:49:04.740]  attacker's death.
[2:49:04.740 --> 2:49:08.420]  And I want to make that clear that we know our rights, we're law abiding citizens and
[2:49:08.420 --> 2:49:12.620]  that we're nonviolent, but we're not going to just stand by and let ourselves be attacked
[2:49:12.620 --> 2:49:15.380]  or, or harmed in any way.
[2:49:15.380 --> 2:49:17.500]  Amen to that.
[2:49:17.500 --> 2:49:22.620]  I mean, this is un, Mark, I'm just speechless right now hearing that.
[2:49:22.620 --> 2:49:23.620]  I don't know what to do.
[2:49:23.620 --> 2:49:27.540]  And you know, at first I was so in shock and then I started really thinking about the ramifications
[2:49:27.540 --> 2:49:29.340]  of this, which is why I contacted the FBI.
[2:49:29.340 --> 2:49:33.420]  I've been in contact with this agent and we're going to see what we can do with taking all
[2:49:33.420 --> 2:49:37.780]  the legal action that we can to the, to the FCC, to the press.
[2:49:37.780 --> 2:49:41.940]  And we're going to, we're going to send a message that this is not tolerable, that they
[2:49:41.940 --> 2:49:42.940]  are the terrorists.
[2:49:42.940 --> 2:49:47.260]  They're, they're the anti-Americans, they're trying to eliminate our constitutional rights,
[2:49:47.260 --> 2:49:48.260]  our second amendment.
[2:49:48.260 --> 2:49:52.940]  And I want to just, our, our first amount, I would just make this clear that the constitution
[2:49:52.940 --> 2:49:55.300]  lists the amendments in the order of importance.
[2:49:55.300 --> 2:49:59.540]  The first one is the right to freedom of speech and the second one is the right to bear arms.
[2:49:59.540 --> 2:50:00.540]  It defends the first.
[2:50:00.540 --> 2:50:06.420]  I also want to make everybody, everybody clear that, that Jesus himself said to sell your
[2:50:06.420 --> 2:50:10.700]  clothes and sell your, sell your goods and buy a sword.
[2:50:10.700 --> 2:50:12.940]  Yeah, there's, there's no doubt.
[2:50:12.940 --> 2:50:16.900]  These are rogue criminals, mad dog killers out of control who are so criminal.
[2:50:16.900 --> 2:50:18.500]  They just think they can let it all hang out.
[2:50:18.500 --> 2:50:20.460]  And I think they've way over reached here, Mark.
[2:50:20.460 --> 2:50:21.460]  Stay there for a final segment.
[2:50:21.460 --> 2:50:26.460]  I want to give out the number to the neocon, a fake conservative anti-American network
[2:50:26.460 --> 2:50:27.660]  he's on.
[2:50:27.660 --> 2:50:30.460]  And then you look, you fake conservatives, the jigs up.
[2:50:30.460 --> 2:50:31.780]  You've attacked Ron Paul, everybody else.
[2:50:31.780 --> 2:50:32.780]  Your name is mud.
[2:50:32.780 --> 2:50:33.780]  Your ratings are plummeting.
[2:50:33.780 --> 2:50:34.780]  You're falling apart.
[2:50:34.780 --> 2:50:37.260]  We will not sit here and take your crime anymore.
[2:50:37.260 --> 2:50:39.900]  We will not take your criminal activity anymore.
[2:50:39.900 --> 2:50:40.900]  You're on the losing side.
[2:50:40.900 --> 2:50:41.900]  You're on the wrong side.
[2:50:41.900 --> 2:50:45.660]  We're going to give out phone number to these criminals and to the FCC on the other side
[2:50:45.660 --> 2:50:46.660]  with Mark Dye.
[2:50:46.660 --> 2:50:48.540]  Stay with us.
[2:50:48.540 --> 2:50:52.780]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced
[2:50:52.780 --> 2:50:53.780]  alkaline environment.
[2:50:53.780 --> 2:50:59.460]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet and lack of exercise.
[2:50:59.460 --> 2:51:05.180]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention
[2:51:05.180 --> 2:51:06.180]  of disease.
[2:51:06.180 --> 2:51:09.700]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity and
[2:51:09.700 --> 2:51:10.780]  loss of weight.
[2:51:10.780 --> 2:51:13.780]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water.
[2:51:13.780 --> 2:51:16.980]  But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[2:51:16.980 --> 2:51:20.900]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[2:51:20.900 --> 2:51:25.220]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize
[2:51:25.220 --> 2:51:26.220]  it.
[2:51:26.220 --> 2:51:27.220]  Do your part.
[2:51:27.220 --> 2:51:29.420]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[2:51:29.420 --> 2:51:34.420]  Alkavision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH
[2:51:34.420 --> 2:51:38.580]  of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.
[2:51:38.580 --> 2:51:45.180]  Order your bottle of Alkavision plasma pH drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.
[2:51:45.180 --> 2:51:48.020]  Again that's alkavision.com.
[2:51:48.020 --> 2:51:52.260]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[2:51:52.260 --> 2:51:56.620]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:51:56.620 --> 2:51:59.620]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[2:51:59.620 --> 2:52:02.780]  Could their objective be world domination?
[2:52:02.780 --> 2:52:05.940]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:52:05.940 --> 2:52:11.860]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[2:52:11.860 --> 2:52:16.300]  of humanity is at hand.
[2:52:16.300 --> 2:52:21.260]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:52:21.260 --> 2:52:25.660]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[2:52:25.660 --> 2:52:50.140]  If you're an adult male, you need to listen to this information.
[2:52:50.140 --> 2:52:54.260]  By the age of 60, half of all men have a prostate related problem.
[2:52:54.260 --> 2:52:58.740]  In the past, many men have turned to sa pometo to support prostate health.
[2:52:58.740 --> 2:53:00.900]  But now there's something much better.
[2:53:00.900 --> 2:53:02.660]  It's called beta prostate.
[2:53:02.660 --> 2:53:08.020]  Beta prostate contains 3,000 times more healthy plant sterols than ordinary sa pometo.
[2:53:08.020 --> 2:53:12.900]  In fact, you'd have to take 100 sa pometo capsules to get the same benefits of one dose
[2:53:12.900 --> 2:53:14.260]  of beta prostate.
[2:53:14.260 --> 2:53:18.820]  It's guaranteed to provide noticeable support even if you're already having prostate related
[2:53:18.820 --> 2:53:19.940]  health issues.
[2:53:19.940 --> 2:53:24.060]  Now you can get Roger Mason's beta prostate formula through this special offer.
[2:53:24.060 --> 2:53:27.780]  And if you call now, you'll learn how to get a free bottle of beta prostate with your
[2:53:27.780 --> 2:53:28.780]  order.
[2:53:28.780 --> 2:53:30.620]  Feel a difference or your money back.

[2:53:43.340 --> 2:53:53.140]  That's 1-800-457-9914.
[2:53:53.140 --> 2:54:00.140]  Cyrus Jones lived to be 103, you're just a little kid, 103's forever.
[2:54:00.140 --> 2:54:11.140]  Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1913 made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to 103.
[2:54:11.140 --> 2:54:21.620]  103 is forever when you're just a little kid, so Cyrus Jones lived forever.
[2:54:21.620 --> 2:54:32.660]  When you dig my grave, when you dig my grave, when you make it just shallow.
[2:54:32.660 --> 2:54:40.700]  German defense minister Willie Nelson, Governor Ventura, architects, engineers, scientists,
[2:54:40.700 --> 2:54:42.700]  they've all come out and said it's an inside job.
[2:54:42.700 --> 2:54:46.700]  They're not going to stop us.
[2:54:46.700 --> 2:54:47.700]  The song's for you, Mark.
[2:54:47.700 --> 2:54:49.940]  We're all going to die someday.
[2:54:49.940 --> 2:54:53.220]  Coming down in history will be remembered, standing up for the little guy.
[2:54:53.220 --> 2:54:58.220]  You should never have to watch your own little children lower than the ground.
[2:54:58.220 --> 2:55:02.940]  I mean, you should never have to bury your own babies.
[2:55:02.940 --> 2:55:03.940]  Grave digger.
[2:55:03.940 --> 2:55:04.940]  Grave digger.
[2:55:04.940 --> 2:55:05.940]  When you dig my grave.
[2:55:05.940 --> 2:55:10.940]  The political system of the New World Order is going to be destroyed.
[2:55:10.940 --> 2:55:17.980]  I want to hold Mark five minutes over to the next hour, then we have Dave Edwards about
[2:55:17.980 --> 2:55:19.620]  domestic death squads.

[2:55:23.620 --> 2:55:26.780]  Yeah, let's play this little part.
[2:55:26.780 --> 2:55:28.180]  The New World Order is scared of dying.
[2:55:28.180 --> 2:55:29.180]  We're not.
[2:55:29.180 --> 2:55:30.180]  We're committed.
[2:55:30.180 --> 2:55:35.380]  We're going to live as long as we can, but we're committed.
[2:55:35.380 --> 2:55:38.940]  Doesn't matter what you do, we're not going to shut up.
[2:55:38.940 --> 2:55:46.180]  We've had enough of your murder, enough of your crime, enough of you destroying our
[2:55:46.180 --> 2:55:50.460]  name, Grave digger.
[2:55:50.460 --> 2:55:52.460]  You know we're going to beat you.
[2:55:52.460 --> 2:55:58.380]  Deciding to pass things in the last 15 years, movements you can control, you're not going
[2:55:58.380 --> 2:55:59.380]  to stop us.
[2:55:59.380 --> 2:56:06.380]  People are going to be part of history, part of bringing you down.
[2:56:06.380 --> 2:56:30.380]  We'll be remembered.
[2:56:30.380 --> 2:56:40.180]  All the torture, all the stage terror, it's all coming out.
[2:56:40.180 --> 2:56:44.460]  I can feel the rain.
[2:56:44.460 --> 2:56:46.780]  Let's go back to Mark Dice.
[2:56:46.780 --> 2:56:51.100]  Mark, give us the numbers to his syndicator.
[2:56:51.100 --> 2:56:53.460]  Give us the numbers to the FCC.
[2:56:53.460 --> 2:56:54.460]  Give us the numbers.
[2:56:54.460 --> 2:56:56.060]  Mark Dice, death threat.
[2:56:56.060 --> 2:57:07.780]  His syndicator is radioamerica.org, the phone number is 703-302-1000, demanding that he
[2:57:07.780 --> 2:57:09.380]  be fired immediately.
[2:57:09.380 --> 2:57:11.380]  Give the number out again.
[2:57:11.380 --> 2:57:19.700]  703-302-1000, also available on markdice.com.
[2:57:19.700 --> 2:57:22.140]  Let me stop you because we're going to hold you over.
[2:57:22.140 --> 2:57:23.140]  You need to go.
[2:57:23.140 --> 2:57:24.140]  It'll probably only cost you $3,000, $4,000.
[2:57:24.140 --> 2:57:26.940]  If you need the money, I'll spot it to you because I know you're broke, Mark.
[2:57:26.940 --> 2:57:32.140]  You need to get an injunction file in your local state or federal court against further
[2:57:32.140 --> 2:57:34.700]  death threats and further solicitation to murder.
[2:57:34.700 --> 2:57:39.300]  Any judge you bring that before and play it under rules of evidence will put an injunction
[2:57:39.300 --> 2:57:40.300]  on him.
[2:57:40.300 --> 2:57:44.020]  That will then get the news and then pressure will be brought and we can get this guy fired.
[2:57:44.020 --> 2:57:45.020]  Go ahead.
[2:57:45.020 --> 2:57:57.260]  Also, the FCC's phone number, 1-888-CALL-FCC, 1-888-CAL-L-FCC.

[2:58:05.980 --> 2:58:07.500]  broadcast as well.
[2:58:07.500 --> 2:58:08.500]  And when is that cretin on?
[2:58:08.500 --> 2:58:11.020]  He's on in a few hours, isn't he?
[2:58:11.020 --> 2:58:13.180]  I think he's on in about three hours.
[2:58:13.180 --> 2:58:18.020]  Yeah, we need everybody to call into the show, act like stupid neocons or dumb liberals
[2:58:18.020 --> 2:58:19.020]  and you can get on.
[2:58:19.020 --> 2:58:20.860]  We're not dumb liberals or dumb neocons.

[3:24:48.520 --> 3:24:52.360]  i've always told myself that if i had the opportunity to
[3:24:52.360 --> 3:24:56.200]  speak with you i just wanted to tip my hat to you and your work
[3:24:56.200 --> 3:25:03.880]  surrounding the bohemian grove um i had a very um interesting experience i'm
[3:25:03.880 --> 3:25:08.600]  30 years ago um as i started to realize that uh
[3:25:08.600 --> 3:25:11.880]  my own father was a member of the bohemian club
[3:25:11.880 --> 3:25:14.920]  as he had related to me and what exactly that meant
[3:25:14.920 --> 3:25:19.320]  um and i went for years really not understanding
[3:25:19.320 --> 3:25:24.760]  uh what all that meant until um i was able to go to your website
[3:25:24.760 --> 3:25:29.880]  sometime late in 2000 and actually found video streaming
[3:25:29.880 --> 3:25:37.320]  so that really changed my life i just wanted to thank you for that
[3:25:37.320 --> 3:25:39.720]  are you there
[3:25:40.840 --> 3:25:43.240]  hello
[3:25:44.840 --> 3:25:50.120]  oh okay um anyway as it is um i thought that it would be
[3:25:50.120 --> 3:25:54.360]  really fairly and just trying to get a grasp of the moment and
[3:25:54.360 --> 3:25:58.200]  thinking about you know what's happened in the last few years and
[3:25:58.200 --> 3:26:02.920]  what's um taking place right now i just was going to read very quickly
[3:26:02.920 --> 3:26:06.600]  um one of the documents that was uh discovered among
[3:26:06.600 --> 3:26:13.640]  some of the former italian fascist uh gladio warriors and undoubtedly
[3:26:13.640 --> 3:26:17.560]  having emanated from the nato supreme command
[3:26:17.560 --> 3:26:20.840]  describing the strategy attention and just very
[3:26:20.840 --> 3:26:25.560]  clearly um talking about what our moment is right now
[3:26:25.560 --> 3:26:29.720]  so i'm going to just read that really quickly um
[3:26:29.720 --> 3:26:33.480]  our belief is that and again i'm quoting our belief is that the first
[3:26:33.480 --> 3:26:38.760]  phase of political activity ought to be to create the conditions favoring
[3:26:38.760 --> 3:26:42.600]  the installation of chaos in all of the regime
[3:26:42.600 --> 3:26:46.200]  structures and this is talking about any regime
[3:26:46.200 --> 3:26:50.680]  that uh the gladio system or the condo system for that matter which
[3:26:50.680 --> 3:26:57.000]  was a subset of the gladio operations um any regime that the system would
[3:26:57.000 --> 3:27:01.480]  target this should necessarily begin with the undermining of the state
[3:27:01.480 --> 3:27:06.520]  economy so as to arrive at confusion throughout the whole legal apparatus
[3:27:06.520 --> 3:27:10.360]  this leads on to a situation of strong political tension
[3:27:10.360 --> 3:27:14.040]  fair in the world of industry and hostility toward the government
[3:27:14.040 --> 3:27:18.600]  and the political parties in our view the first move we should make is to
[3:27:18.600 --> 3:27:21.160]  destroy the structure of the democratic state
[3:27:21.160 --> 3:27:24.760]  under the cover of communist and pro-chinese activities
[3:27:24.760 --> 3:27:28.120]  moreover we have people who have infiltrated these groups
[3:27:28.120 --> 3:27:32.440]  and obviously we will have to tailor our actions to the ethos of the milieu
[3:27:32.440 --> 3:27:35.000]  depending on what the culture of that particular
[3:27:35.000 --> 3:27:40.360]  uh country or regime might be propaganda and action of a sort which will
[3:27:40.360 --> 3:27:43.560]  seem to have emanated from our communist adversaries
[3:27:43.560 --> 3:27:46.200]  and pressure brought to bear on people in whom
[3:27:46.200 --> 3:27:50.040]  power is invested at every level that will create a feeling of hostility
[3:27:50.040 --> 3:27:53.400]  toward those who threaten the peace of each and every nation
[3:27:53.400 --> 3:27:56.840]  and at the same time we must raise up a defender of the citizenry
[3:27:56.840 --> 3:27:59.960]  against the disintegration brought about by terrorism
[3:27:59.960 --> 3:28:05.480]  and subversion and what we see here in just this little microscopic
[3:28:05.480 --> 3:28:10.120]  event with mark is that obviously that strategy of tension
[3:28:10.120 --> 3:28:13.400]  is being turned on him and he's being depicted
[3:28:13.400 --> 3:28:16.920]  as being subversive as being then quote unquote
[3:28:16.920 --> 3:28:21.960]  a terrorist which is what they do and then writing in on the white horse
[3:28:21.960 --> 3:28:28.760]  um uh in the microcosm um is this uh Reagan fellow who's um basically saying
[3:28:28.760 --> 3:28:32.440]  we're going to go ahead and defend our country defend our troops against this
[3:28:32.440 --> 3:28:34.920]  subversion

[3:33:03.640 --> 3:33:06.840]  that are gutting this country setting it up to take the pension funds

[3:33:15.240 --> 3:33:20.200]  we were just talking to this academic they're working for the Smithsonian
[3:33:20.200 --> 3:33:23.800]  they tried to recruit him into covert operations he spoke out against it
[3:33:23.800 --> 3:33:27.080]  exposed it trying to kill him
[3:33:27.400 --> 3:33:30.840]  and they try to run him down with a semi to see the black cop high and tight

[3:33:45.320 --> 3:33:51.800]  but it doesn't matter my missiles in the info war fired my payload is dropped

[3:33:59.720 --> 3:34:02.920]  millions you my listeners have done the same thing
[3:34:02.920 --> 3:34:06.360]  and i know i've done the right thing and i know
[3:34:06.360 --> 3:34:10.200]  that i i'm declaring the victory right now you can't take away what we've done
[3:34:10.200 --> 3:34:14.280]  going back to you sir we got about uh 12 minutes before ron paul's
[3:34:14.280 --> 3:34:17.880]  and half the time his campaign head is just so busy he'll end up he wanted on
[3:34:17.880 --> 3:34:20.360]  but he'll end up not calling in so maybe to the end of the hour but
[3:34:20.360 --> 3:34:23.880]  we'll see what happens are we calling ron paul's god jessie benner is he calling
[3:34:23.880 --> 3:34:27.320]  us john okay we'll call him in about 45 after
[3:34:27.320 --> 3:34:30.680]  uh you've got the floor for the last time that we've got to have you back up
[3:34:30.680 --> 3:34:33.480]  in the next few weeks for two hours this is too important
[3:34:33.480 --> 3:34:36.360]  uh but i continue you earlier you're reading their own government documents
[3:34:36.360 --> 3:34:39.800]  declassified about how they control the communists the fascists it's all
[3:34:39.800 --> 3:34:44.600]  stage continue um thanks a lot alex well
[3:34:44.600 --> 3:34:48.280]  one of the things that um you know referencing back to
[3:34:48.280 --> 3:34:52.120]  um operation condor which many people don't realize
[3:34:52.120 --> 3:34:56.840]  um operation condor was a subset of operation gladeo
[3:34:56.840 --> 3:35:01.080]  and oftentimes you had gladeo warriors and i'm talking about
[3:35:01.080 --> 3:35:04.440]  ex-nazi commando that that could stop oh
[3:35:04.440 --> 3:35:07.560]  as well as italian black shirt fascist
[3:35:07.560 --> 3:35:11.880]  um and the other sort of paramilitaries that were developed
[3:35:11.880 --> 3:35:17.960]  by um by nato by the cia after world war two would come from europe
[3:35:17.960 --> 3:35:21.960]  go into latin america and and participate lead
[3:35:21.960 --> 3:35:28.840]  uh trained organized um death squad torture cells and um
[3:35:28.840 --> 3:35:33.160]  and so it operation condor was definitely a subset of
[3:35:33.160 --> 3:35:37.160]  of operation gladeo and now they're using the cadres they trained tens of
[3:35:37.160 --> 3:35:40.520]  thousands and it's now mainstream news reported to years before it came out
[3:35:40.520 --> 3:35:44.360]  in iraq and now they're trying to figure bringing that up alex that
[3:35:44.360 --> 3:35:48.920]  that's exactly i just wanted to sort of trace that genealogy really quickly that
[3:35:48.920 --> 3:35:51.880]  one of the some of one of the things that people don't
[3:35:51.880 --> 3:35:55.720]  generally understand is that operation condor which was
[3:35:55.720 --> 3:35:59.800]  basically a south american phenomenon was then
[3:35:59.800 --> 3:36:03.560]  brought up into central america in the 1980s in oliver north and
[3:36:03.560 --> 3:36:10.040]  all of the iran contra villains were involved in um an operation condor
[3:36:10.040 --> 3:36:13.640]  uh operation in central america in the honduras
[3:36:13.640 --> 3:36:18.440]  salvador el Salvador nicaragua guatemala guatemala and the
[3:36:18.440 --> 3:36:24.440]  massacre of you know uh about 150 000 guatemala mayo
[3:36:24.440 --> 3:36:27.960]  was a condor operation and oliver north
[3:36:27.960 --> 3:36:32.520]  and the different uh condor commandos who were
[3:36:32.520 --> 3:36:39.160]  working in central america then later on and and as well as the south american
[3:36:39.160 --> 3:36:43.720]  condorites did organize themselves into private security firms that are being
[3:36:43.720 --> 3:36:49.080]  contracted as you were saying um into iraq as well as
[3:36:49.080 --> 3:36:53.080]  in operation throughout north and south america so
[3:36:53.080 --> 3:36:58.120]  you're basically you have here a cadre of tens of thousands of
[3:36:58.120 --> 3:37:03.560]  private security um employees who have been trained either directly or
[3:37:03.560 --> 3:37:09.400]  indirectly literally by nazis in train in and now it's come out
[3:37:09.400 --> 3:37:13.240]  mainstream news that the that the army training schools teach them how to
[3:37:13.240 --> 3:37:18.120]  torture people now it's not even hidden what went on at the school of americas
[3:37:18.120 --> 3:37:23.240]  that's exactly right in this and that entire complex of the school of americas
[3:37:23.240 --> 3:37:30.520]  and operation condor um had as its genesis um the bringing over of the
[3:37:30.520 --> 3:37:35.880]  nazis um into south america back in the late 40s and the 50s and really this
[3:37:35.880 --> 3:37:39.720]  is private corporate interests with drug dealing murdering torture teams
[3:37:39.720 --> 3:37:43.800]  that just said why not take the us over to and they're arrogant haughty
[3:37:43.800 --> 3:37:47.080]  uh north and his and his buddies like uh
[3:37:47.080 --> 3:37:49.800]  reagan they just know it they mean they all brag about it
[3:37:49.800 --> 3:37:52.600]  they get to act like they're patriotic while they suck the country dry and they
[3:37:52.600 --> 3:37:55.480]  prance around and don't think the left's going to save you they're just as
[3:37:55.480 --> 3:37:58.920]  involved now this thing transcends parties doesn't it now
[3:37:58.920 --> 3:38:03.160]  well that's exactly right every everything the one of the things that i
[3:38:03.160 --> 3:38:06.920]  definitely wanted to say today was that unfortunately
[3:38:06.920 --> 3:38:10.280]  um one of the big pysops is that we
[3:38:10.280 --> 3:38:17.880]  um we currently um live in a fascist state and the pysop is that
[3:38:17.880 --> 3:38:22.680]  the all of the facades of american republican
[3:38:22.680 --> 3:38:27.400]  democracy um you know continue to exist when in fact they do not
[3:38:27.400 --> 3:38:30.920]  and that's the appeal that i was hearing today about
[3:38:30.920 --> 3:38:34.520]  you know appealing to the judicial system and everything which
[3:38:34.520 --> 3:38:38.600]  undoubtedly at the lower levels the last bastion of
[3:38:38.600 --> 3:38:41.720]  of constitutional democracy here in this country
[3:38:41.720 --> 3:38:45.480]  and yet still um we really don't have
[3:38:45.480 --> 3:38:49.720]  anything but a hollow shell of the of the constitutional government that we
[3:38:49.720 --> 3:38:55.640]  have been raised to believe in so the problem here is that
[3:38:55.640 --> 3:38:58.920]  um now when they start to get a more overt like this
[3:38:58.920 --> 3:39:03.640]  which is exactly what they did in south america during in the condor years
[3:39:03.640 --> 3:39:06.680]  uh i think basically what they're basically saying is
[3:39:06.680 --> 3:39:09.800]  we're going to go ahead we're going to do what we want to do
[3:39:09.800 --> 3:39:16.040]  and you just watch we can do this with impunity
[3:39:16.040 --> 3:39:19.480]  yeah well there are a lot of people in this country who aren't poor
[3:39:19.480 --> 3:39:26.280]  starving unarmed um meso american populations and it's going to get bad
[3:39:26.280 --> 3:39:30.120]  my god now the good news is this has been going on so
[3:39:30.120 --> 3:39:32.920]  long too that's part one i want you to answer that but then part two
[3:39:32.920 --> 3:39:35.640]  look at the intelligence community speaking out look at all the generals
[3:39:35.640 --> 3:39:38.120]  coming out look at people saying no to torture
[3:39:38.120 --> 3:39:40.760]  i mean i want people to know we've got a fighting chance here they may be able
[3:39:40.760 --> 3:39:42.680]  to kill a few of us and try to scare everybody
[3:39:42.680 --> 3:39:45.720]  you got to get more vocal if that happens folks don't let us die in vain if
[3:39:45.720 --> 3:39:47.960]  that is to happen and god forbid it i love my life and
[3:39:47.960 --> 3:39:51.560]  wanted to continue on but go ahead and comment on that
[3:39:51.560 --> 3:39:54.920]  well i i i think i'm going to come at this from a very
[3:39:54.920 --> 3:39:59.240]  a very different angle uh one of the other things that i did want to
[3:39:59.240 --> 3:40:04.040]  want to communicate today was that um i am a cultural anthropologist and i'm
[3:40:04.040 --> 3:40:08.040]  currently working with um the more traditional and the more religious
[3:40:08.040 --> 3:40:12.760]  hopi indians and um just in the course of events i did
[3:40:12.760 --> 3:40:16.280]  share some of the uh some of the information that i'd
[3:40:16.280 --> 3:40:21.240]  been able to uh discover in the last seven or eight years and
[3:40:21.240 --> 3:40:24.440]  just talking to them about nine eleven and that type of thing and
[3:40:24.440 --> 3:40:28.440]  and surprisingly um the hopi indians actually have
[3:40:28.440 --> 3:40:31.800]  a number of prophecies to directly address
[3:40:31.800 --> 3:40:35.400]  um the current situation that we're in right now and
[3:40:35.400 --> 3:40:39.160]  while i can't be exactly specific one of the things that
[3:40:39.160 --> 3:40:43.640]  they do say is that um there will be um
[3:40:43.640 --> 3:40:46.520]  something that will make the 1860s in this country
[3:40:46.520 --> 3:40:50.600]  just look like nothing but there is going to be a huge conflict
[3:40:50.600 --> 3:40:55.320]  within this country enough very large like loss of life
[3:40:55.320 --> 3:40:59.800]  well just geopolitically i can look at that from a sociological perspective
[3:40:59.800 --> 3:41:03.640]  and you know these young guys on power trips that have tortured they've
[3:41:03.640 --> 3:41:06.280]  wedded themselves to evil they've committed to what they're doing because
[3:41:06.280 --> 3:41:10.120]  they've had to rationalize it some are just psychopaths
[3:41:10.120 --> 3:41:13.560]  i want you to address the point they are losing the moral ground a lot of
[3:41:13.560 --> 3:41:16.120]  their people do not like what's happening now it's one thing to go down
[3:41:16.120 --> 3:41:18.600]  there and kill quote foreigners it's another thing to come here and do it's
[3:41:18.600 --> 3:41:21.720]  what i'm saying well that's exactly that and that very
[3:41:21.720 --> 3:41:25.880]  much mirrors when you when you talk about the retired
[3:41:25.880 --> 3:41:30.600]  um the retired uh intelligence community the retired
[3:41:30.600 --> 3:41:34.520]  military all these generals leaving this is exactly what happened in all of the
[3:41:34.520 --> 3:41:40.040]  south american countries um more condor existed which is basically all of them
[3:41:40.040 --> 3:41:44.680]  um but brazil uruguay pataguay um argentina
[3:41:44.680 --> 3:41:49.720]  um peru bolivia ecuador you you name it um
[3:41:49.720 --> 3:41:53.400]  and in chile obviously but in all of those countries
[3:41:53.400 --> 3:42:00.600]  um you have this small fascist elite who then went after what they called
[3:42:00.600 --> 3:42:04.520]  the constitutionalists and that included generals and
[3:42:04.520 --> 3:42:08.760]  politicians and and they much of what condor was about
[3:42:08.760 --> 3:42:13.320]  was identifying the opposition in in the regular
[3:42:13.320 --> 3:42:16.600]  hierarchy of the military and the political world
[3:42:16.600 --> 3:42:20.520]  and and and murdering those people and eliminating them
[3:42:20.520 --> 3:42:25.160]  so that they could silence all official or legitimate
[3:42:25.160 --> 3:42:27.960]  um voices of opposition to this program so
[3:42:27.960 --> 3:42:32.280]  they start out as a very small tight elite cadre
[3:42:32.280 --> 3:42:38.440]  and then they go about eliminating all of the significant legitimate voices
[3:42:38.440 --> 3:42:41.720]  but again i've analyzed the history i mean you're an expert in this but you
[3:42:41.720 --> 3:42:44.680]  recognize i've read quite a bit about it myself and had a lot of other experts
[3:42:44.680 --> 3:42:48.040]  on i see a different sociological makeup here
[3:42:48.040 --> 3:42:50.840]  and and they even admit a lot of their own documents that it's not going to be
[3:42:50.840 --> 3:42:54.840]  as easy here as it was in latin america and a lot of them
[3:42:54.840 --> 3:42:58.040]  um i mean people are going to strike back as my point
[3:42:58.040 --> 3:43:02.440]  this is not yes and i've i've had conversations with um
[3:43:02.440 --> 3:43:06.920]  i think one of the things that they've actually you know now try to avoid
[3:43:06.920 --> 3:43:10.360]  but uh i think the vietnam war actually comes into play here because
[3:43:10.360 --> 3:43:14.760]  dragging there you had a very large a group of uh
[3:43:14.760 --> 3:43:18.440]  of uh citizen vets who have now come back and
[3:43:18.440 --> 3:43:21.800]  who are who understand how to handle themselves etc
[3:43:21.800 --> 3:43:26.040]  and i have actually had conversations with with vets who
[3:43:26.040 --> 3:43:29.560]  um who say to me you know if what you say
[3:43:29.560 --> 3:43:35.000]  is true about 9-11 and and all of this what they say is that there are 500
[3:43:35.000 --> 3:43:39.640]  thousand people who would in fact fight against something
[3:43:39.640 --> 3:43:44.440]  like that if what you're saying is true well that's the bottom line i think
[3:43:44.440 --> 3:43:47.640]  they really are starting to fight with a tiger and they're a mouse
[3:43:47.640 --> 3:43:53.640]  and i just hope to god they stop i mean i i hope to god they slow down but the
[3:43:53.640 --> 3:43:56.920]  signs are folks this is the end game we told you this was real we told you
[3:43:56.920 --> 3:44:00.200]  they were building camps we told and you're the main target american people
[3:44:00.200 --> 3:44:03.000]  you know it's not just us at the forefront fighting them
[3:44:03.000 --> 3:44:06.280]  and i i'm at the point of return a long time ago i'm committed to this and i'm
[3:44:06.280 --> 3:44:10.920]  at peace with that uh it's just so sad that good more good people didn't
[3:44:10.920 --> 3:44:14.440]  stand up earlier before this probably unfolds
[3:44:14.440 --> 3:44:18.920]  um it's it's it's it's it's just so sad
[3:44:18.920 --> 3:44:22.840]  caught it so and as you know i'm i'm working with peterdale scott on this
[3:44:22.840 --> 3:44:26.120]  on this book and he is one of the foremost
[3:44:26.120 --> 3:44:29.800]  um voices in terms of trying to bring to light
[3:44:29.800 --> 3:44:33.320]  what it is that they've been doing ever since the 1980s in the development of
[3:44:33.320 --> 3:44:36.760]  continuity of government in terms of the internment camp
[3:44:36.760 --> 3:44:40.280]  and one of the things that again one of the things that people don't realize is
[3:44:40.280 --> 3:44:44.360]  that the internment camps concentration camps torture camps
[3:44:44.360 --> 3:44:48.040]  were a very huge part of the apparatus of operation condor
[3:44:48.040 --> 3:44:51.480]  god i think about all the admitted crimes how they would enjoyably murder
[3:44:51.480 --> 3:44:56.120]  children and torture them to death i i just can't believe that's who we are
[3:44:56.120 --> 3:44:59.240]  and i can't believe that they somehow sold a bunch of mainline conservatives
[3:44:59.240 --> 3:45:05.160]  that's manly god help them all god help them all god help them
[3:45:05.160 --> 3:45:08.360]  well you know alex one other thing that i really did want to share
[3:45:08.360 --> 3:45:12.120]  today before we ran out of time was that you know when we start talking about
[3:45:12.120 --> 3:45:17.240]  our political leadership you know one has to realize that um
[3:45:17.240 --> 3:45:21.000]  just give you one example let me say this there's a there's a reason congress
[3:45:21.000 --> 3:45:25.000]  doesn't impeach there's a reason they're all scared too they know
[3:45:25.000 --> 3:45:32.600]  well as as early as 1979 there was a secret classified senate report
[3:45:32.600 --> 3:45:39.320]  that talked about the fact that the cia was running operation condor
[3:45:39.320 --> 3:45:45.880]  with the full participation of of nazi gestapo ss
[3:45:45.880 --> 3:45:49.080]  cadres you know maybe perhaps even numbering
[3:45:49.080 --> 3:45:53.240]  into the tens of thousands and that was a secret classified
[3:45:53.240 --> 3:45:57.480]  senate report it still classified jack anderson got his hand on it
[3:45:57.480 --> 3:46:01.720]  and started reporting on it in august of 1979 we got to let you go because
[3:46:01.720 --> 3:46:04.920]  we've got the ron paul can ban here but i'll say this my grandfather was a
[3:46:04.920 --> 3:46:07.480]  you know worked in the oil fields and was a lease hound and when he was out in
[3:46:07.480 --> 3:46:11.560]  midland texas he said that he'd go into the military slash you know
[3:46:11.560 --> 3:46:16.520]  uh oil field worker bar restaurants and he'd see a bunch of germans there
[3:46:16.520 --> 3:46:20.760]  in u.s military uniforms this wasn't with nasa so it's just it's just everywhere
[3:46:20.760 --> 3:46:23.640]  give out some websites real fast and then we're gonna have you back up in the

[3:46:58.120 --> 3:47:01.800]  of the show coming up with ron paul's announcement uh he never really even
[3:47:01.800 --> 3:47:05.400]  said he was dropping out of the campaign last night but the website said that
[3:47:05.400 --> 3:47:08.840]  so to be specific what is going on jessie benton

[3:47:19.320 --> 3:47:22.600]  republic and take back our constitution and if you just look at the
[3:47:22.600 --> 3:47:26.520]  incredible expansion of liberty minded people and the way the
[3:47:26.520 --> 3:47:30.760]  message spread during the past 17 months the pcc it's been incredible and it's
[3:47:30.760 --> 3:47:33.240]  all because of the grassroots supporters out there
[3:47:33.240 --> 3:47:37.480]  and now uh what dr paul has legally ended the pcc
[3:47:37.480 --> 3:47:41.000]  but that's just to get the fbc off our backs so we can really do the work that

[3:49:07.400 --> 3:49:09.960]  and then we think we have dozens and dozens more
