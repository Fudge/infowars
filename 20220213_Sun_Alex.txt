[00:00.000 --> 00:29.320]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this live Sunday, February 13th edition of
[00:29.320 --> 00:31.320]  the Alex Jones Show.
[00:31.320 --> 00:38.920]  Myself, Jason Burmeson, and I will be here for the next four hours of live transmission
[00:38.920 --> 00:42.640]  blasting out across the United States and the world.
[00:42.640 --> 00:47.400]  Well, almost every broadcast I begin now, I say this is the biggest news day ever because
[00:47.400 --> 00:51.040]  the world is just getting more and more intense, I don't think anybody disagrees with that
[00:51.040 --> 00:56.280]  statement, but let me just in this first five minutes tell you what's coming up, ladies
[00:56.280 --> 01:00.640]  and gentlemen, right now.
[01:00.640 --> 01:05.920]  You have the whole Durham investigation that's been going on for now three years, and it's
[01:05.920 --> 01:12.240]  had some indictments against FBI agents that falsified or just department agents that falsified
[01:12.240 --> 01:14.440]  emails on Russiagate and things like that.
[01:14.440 --> 01:21.240]  We've also had Hillary Clinton's lawyer indicted her main lawyer, and now they in the investigation
[01:21.240 --> 01:26.760]  have the documents and have released them where they did infiltrate when he was a candidate
[01:26.760 --> 01:35.000]  and when he was president, the Trump Tower, the White House, the president's phones, everything.
[01:35.000 --> 01:37.960]  I mean, this is just unbelievable, but we already knew this.
[01:37.960 --> 01:47.880]  Remember, I told you this in 2016, and we knew that because of Sheriff Arpaio and the
[01:47.880 --> 01:54.480]  DEA came to him and gave him hundreds of thousands of names being spied on in a database they
[01:54.480 --> 02:00.080]  were able to get into that was a CIA Justice Department database, and we were the only
[02:00.080 --> 02:02.040]  show that would put it on air.
[02:02.040 --> 02:08.600]  And let me tell you, all hell broke loose when we did that in 2016 and then 2017.
[02:08.600 --> 02:15.560]  And the reason I knew the documents were real, they had an old office landline that I used
[02:15.560 --> 02:20.160]  to a lot of radio interviews on, but hadn't used in years that no one knew I had, and
[02:20.160 --> 02:21.720]  it was that number.
[02:21.720 --> 02:26.840]  And then it was Trump's private Marlago number that I knew was real that nobody else, various
[02:26.840 --> 02:29.800]  people had in his private apartment.
[02:29.800 --> 02:35.560]  And that really freaked me out, ladies and gentlemen, that they were spying on me illegally.
[02:35.560 --> 02:41.160]  And the DEA actually gave us the information through the sheriff who they then indicted,
[02:41.160 --> 02:46.640]  not for that, but for other BS, and Trump had to give him a pardon.
[02:46.640 --> 02:55.440]  So this is very serious business, and my memory is good, but there's so much going on that
[02:55.440 --> 02:56.440]  sometimes I forget.
[02:56.440 --> 03:00.200]  So I called Roger Stone, who's got laryngitis, but he's still going to come on last segment
[03:00.200 --> 03:01.760]  of this hour, only one segment.
[03:01.760 --> 03:05.600]  And I said, I can't exactly remember other than the DEA documents, how we knew Trump
[03:05.600 --> 03:06.840]  was being spied on.
[03:06.840 --> 03:11.740]  He said, well, they remember, they bragged during the campaign, and then once he got
[03:11.740 --> 03:17.240]  elected that, oh, we had him under surveillance, Clinton bragged, we know he's a Russian.
[03:17.240 --> 03:22.640]  So they had bragged they had him under surveillance, and then Judge Napolitano had a lot of sources
[03:22.640 --> 03:26.720]  and does, we should get him on this week, and he came out and said, indeed, he talked
[03:26.720 --> 03:31.280]  to people in the justice department, and they said, no, Hillary was illegally spying.
[03:31.280 --> 03:37.800]  He got suspended, if you remember, for a while over that, in 2017.
[03:37.800 --> 03:47.920]  And the leftist media, what that was in March, in March of 2017, went completely bonkers.
[03:47.920 --> 03:49.960]  That's when all the lawsuits got filed against us.
[03:49.960 --> 03:52.360]  They started having helicopters over the office.
[03:52.360 --> 03:58.000]  They sent in CIA infiltrators, literally folks, to try to infiltrate my family and business.
[03:58.000 --> 03:59.800]  It was not fun.
[03:59.800 --> 04:03.360]  But the people were so scummy, you could spot them quickly.
[04:03.360 --> 04:04.360]  They did infiltrate.
[04:04.360 --> 04:08.520]  They did pay some people off to go lie about us, but nobody believed it.
[04:08.520 --> 04:12.400]  So when I tell you all this, I've been living it.
[04:12.400 --> 04:15.600]  And those Judge Arpaio interviews are out there.
[04:15.600 --> 04:19.000]  We redacted most of the names and just put out Trump's name and my name and some phone
[04:19.000 --> 04:23.840]  numbers blacked out partially to prove this was happening.
[04:23.840 --> 04:30.160]  And so not only was I exposing illegal spying, I was exposing what was being done to me.
[04:30.160 --> 04:35.360]  It was all my numbers, by the way, my cell phone numbers, office numbers.
[04:35.360 --> 04:39.760]  But it was that landline that nobody had, that I just kind of left on.
[04:39.760 --> 04:44.920]  So I got all the CNN articles, New York Times, Alex Jones as a liar, nobody spying on Trump.
[04:44.920 --> 04:49.480]  And of course, we were next year's news today, or five years from now today.
[04:49.480 --> 04:50.480]  We nailed all of it.
[04:50.480 --> 04:51.480]  We'll be right back with that.
[04:51.480 --> 04:52.480]  And even bigger news.
[04:52.480 --> 05:01.200]  Stay with us.
[05:01.200 --> 05:02.760]  Sold out for months.
[05:02.760 --> 05:08.080]  X3 is now back in stock, ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing,
[05:08.080 --> 05:12.480]  our products are game changing and so many people are deficient in iodine.
[05:12.480 --> 05:14.800]  It's not the soil anymore.
[05:14.800 --> 05:16.720]  Most of the ocean is contaminated.
[05:16.720 --> 05:22.080]  But when you get high quality tri iodine, all three of the healthy types together, it
[05:22.080 --> 05:26.720]  does amazing things for your stamina, your libido, but most importantly, your immune
[05:26.720 --> 05:27.720]  system.
[05:27.720 --> 05:33.720]  So, X3, the only tri iodine on the market, highest grade, is now exclusively available
[05:33.720 --> 05:37.360]  again at 50% off at mforwardstore.com.
[05:37.360 --> 05:41.200]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body, it takes about
[05:41.200 --> 05:45.560]  two weeks to get on average, you really need to experience X3.
[05:45.560 --> 05:48.360]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.
[05:48.360 --> 05:52.440]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing
[05:52.440 --> 05:53.440]  what does for your body.
[05:53.440 --> 05:58.160]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds the info or a true 360 win.
[05:58.160 --> 06:11.000]  So again, X3, back in stock.
[06:11.000 --> 06:15.840]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[06:15.840 --> 06:22.560]  If you want to stop tyranny, well, so does he live from the info wars.com studios.
[06:22.560 --> 06:33.200]  It's Alex Jones Sunday live, deep state caught illegally spying on President Trump.
[06:33.200 --> 06:39.240]  Tune in for exclusive details and boy, let me tell you exclusive because I was part of
[06:39.240 --> 06:45.240]  the same illegal spy operation and that was why we were given the information by the DEA
[06:45.240 --> 06:46.240]  and broke it.
[06:46.240 --> 06:50.200]  And I went from a threat to the globalist to like the top threat level, and they actually
[06:50.200 --> 06:55.360]  turned their leftist arms of the CIA and others against us through all these law firms and
[06:55.360 --> 06:56.360]  groups.
[06:56.360 --> 06:57.360]  And it's been crazy.
[06:57.360 --> 07:01.600]  But to watch their whole thing start to fall apart right before our eyes is incredible.
[07:01.600 --> 07:02.600]  That's coming up.
[07:02.600 --> 07:06.600]  A Justice Department's release documents they got when they raided Hillary's top lawyer,
[07:06.600 --> 07:08.080]  and they were spying on Trump Tower.
[07:08.080 --> 07:09.520]  They were spying on his cell phones.
[07:09.520 --> 07:13.880]  They were spying once he was the president, of course they had spies inside the White
[07:13.880 --> 07:15.760]  House.
[07:15.760 --> 07:16.760]  This is totally illegal.
[07:16.760 --> 07:24.720]  I mean this is like 50,000 times worse than Richard Nixon spying on the other candidate
[07:24.720 --> 07:27.320]  and having people break into a psychiatrist office.
[07:27.320 --> 07:32.000]  This is spying on the candidate and then the president of the United States for the other
[07:32.000 --> 07:35.880]  political party, and of course Seth Rich and all the rest of it.
[07:35.880 --> 07:39.320]  It's just history, what happened to those that tried to get that information out.
[07:39.320 --> 07:44.120]  And the system has been so incredibly scared and hasn't known what to do.
[07:44.120 --> 07:54.240]  So we have that massive, massive, massive news dealing with Brennan and Obama.
[07:54.240 --> 07:58.440]  And they're trying to hang Hillary out right now, but she was part of it, but this is very
[07:58.440 --> 07:59.440]  dangerous stuff.
[07:59.440 --> 08:03.000]  And the only reason I'm not in prison or dead right now is by the grace of Jesus and your
[08:03.000 --> 08:04.000]  prayers and support.
[08:04.000 --> 08:09.440]  And let me tell you, we have been in the lion's den for six years in this fight.
[08:09.440 --> 08:11.000]  And it's just getting more intense by the minute.
[08:11.000 --> 08:13.160]  So Roger Stone joins us for one segment.
[08:13.160 --> 08:15.480]  The end of the hour, he's got laryngitis, but he's still going to come on about this
[08:15.480 --> 08:19.000]  because we have all the articles, New York Times, Washington Post attacking us.
[08:19.000 --> 08:20.960]  Jones and Stone are insane.
[08:20.960 --> 08:23.240]  No one was spying on Trump Tower.
[08:23.240 --> 08:24.840]  No one was spying on the White House.
[08:24.840 --> 08:26.480]  We knew exactly who was doing it.
[08:26.480 --> 08:29.840]  We blew their moles inside Fiona Hill and others.
[08:29.840 --> 08:34.680]  But that 60 minute shows about what victims they are and I'm so bad that she doesn't know
[08:34.680 --> 08:35.680]  anything about George Soros.
[08:35.680 --> 08:39.520]  She just ran his foundation because they just gaslight you as their enemy.
[08:39.520 --> 08:41.480]  They just hate your guts.
[08:41.480 --> 08:45.120]  Five seconds of research will discover they're lying to you.
[08:45.120 --> 08:46.280]  So that's all coming up.
[08:46.280 --> 08:49.360]  That is a huge, huge, huge thing.
[08:49.360 --> 08:52.080]  In fact, let me just go ahead and play 60 minutes.
[08:52.080 --> 08:53.320]  This did not age well.
[08:53.320 --> 08:56.000]  So it turns out they interviewed Trump on Friday.
[08:56.000 --> 09:01.920]  They were going to air this on Sunday and it had just broken Friday that Durham had
[09:01.920 --> 09:07.160]  released part of these documents proving that indeed the Clintons and others were illegally
[09:07.160 --> 09:13.040]  using the Justice Department and fake information they gave the Justice Department that Trump
[09:13.040 --> 09:16.760]  was a Russian agent and all this to spy on them.
[09:16.760 --> 09:20.160]  And once that was opened up, then the CIA could come involved saying it was a foreign
[09:20.160 --> 09:21.160]  intelligence operation.
[09:21.160 --> 09:23.360]  Of course, they were involved the whole time.
[09:23.360 --> 09:29.720]  And so that's huge, but Stahl just told Trump he was a liar, even though it had already broken
[09:29.720 --> 09:31.200]  that morning.
[09:31.200 --> 09:33.760]  We learned they interviewed Trump in the afternoon.
[09:33.760 --> 09:37.120]  He was offering to give it to her and she said, you're full of it and they're going
[09:37.120 --> 09:38.120]  to air it tonight.
[09:38.120 --> 09:44.160]  I think it airs now or what is it next hour depends on the time zone saying he's full
[09:44.160 --> 09:45.160]  of crap.
[09:45.160 --> 09:46.160]  Here it is.
[09:46.160 --> 09:52.600]  So the biggest scandal was when they spy to my campaign.
[09:52.600 --> 09:53.600]  They spy to my campaign.
[09:53.600 --> 09:55.560]  There's no real evidence of that.
[09:55.560 --> 09:56.560]  Of course there is.
[09:56.560 --> 09:57.560]  It's all over the place.
[09:57.560 --> 10:00.600]  Leslie, they spy to my campaign and they got caught.
[10:00.600 --> 10:02.240]  Can I say something?
[10:02.240 --> 10:07.160]  You know, this is 60 minutes and we can't put on things we can't verify.
[10:07.160 --> 10:09.000]  You won't put it on because it's bad for Biden.
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.200]  We can't put on things we can't verify.
[10:11.200 --> 10:12.840]  Leslie, they spy to my campaign.
[10:12.840 --> 10:13.840]  Well, we can't verify that.
[10:13.840 --> 10:16.040]  It's been totally verified.
[10:16.040 --> 10:18.600]  It's been just go down and get the papers.
[10:18.600 --> 10:21.400]  They spy to my campaign, they got caught.
[10:21.400 --> 10:24.560]  And then they went much further than that and they got caught.
[10:24.560 --> 10:26.120]  And you will see that, Leslie.
[10:26.120 --> 10:28.600]  And you know that, but you just don't want to put it on.
[10:28.600 --> 10:31.880]  As a matter of fact, I don't know that.
[10:31.880 --> 10:37.120]  This is the definition of something blowing up in your face.
[10:37.120 --> 10:41.320]  I mean, it's the Justice Department put this out and it's not like it's their normal made
[10:41.320 --> 10:42.320]  up stuff.
[10:42.320 --> 10:48.000]  Oh, there's record white supremacists and, you know, anti-vaxxers are white supremacists.
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.840]  Not the leftist PR stuff, the actual documents that they have now released from what the
[10:52.840 --> 10:57.680]  Clinton campaign was doing, filing false reports and data and involved in a bunch of other
[10:57.680 --> 11:03.640]  criminal activity and hiring private groups to hack in and break in to the Trump campaign,
[11:03.640 --> 11:07.360]  to Trump Tower and later, obviously, the White House and it's all coming down.
[11:07.360 --> 11:08.360]  Talk about a house of cards.
[11:08.360 --> 11:10.400]  This is historic.
[11:10.400 --> 11:15.120]  This is literally just isn't even in the same ballpark as Watergate.
[11:15.120 --> 11:18.520]  I think Nixon, what he did at Watergate was wrong.
[11:18.520 --> 11:24.120]  That is like stealing a stick of bubblegum or a candy bar when you're five years old
[11:24.120 --> 11:30.880]  versus raping an old lady in the alleyway is, I mean, the intelligence agencies spying
[11:30.880 --> 11:32.680]  on the candidate and then the president.
[11:32.680 --> 11:37.080]  I mean, that is just over the top illegal.
[11:37.080 --> 11:40.600]  And obviously they're all connected to China and Russia and that's coming out, too.
[11:40.600 --> 11:41.680]  And we're selling the data.
[11:41.680 --> 11:44.080]  In fact, Liz Cheney is the bag lady.
[11:44.080 --> 11:45.080]  That's coming out.
[11:45.080 --> 11:50.320]  Man, I'm having a little bit of a little bit of an anxiety attack.
[11:50.320 --> 11:52.120]  I mean, this is just this is so insane.
[11:52.120 --> 11:55.440]  So we're going to be talking about this obviously a lot.
[11:55.440 --> 11:58.320]  And then here's the next big thing.
[11:58.320 --> 12:00.720]  Here's the next big thing.
[12:00.720 --> 12:08.560]  Russia just pulled today all of their personnel out of their Ukrainian embassy and more US
[12:08.560 --> 12:11.440]  troops and more equipment and NATO troops are moving in.
[12:11.440 --> 12:14.320]  And so Russia on their news is saying, you're building up troops.
[12:14.320 --> 12:16.920]  You're giving them heavy weapons, anti-tank, anti-aircraft.
[12:16.920 --> 12:19.520]  We don't want to invade, but don't take Ukraine.
[12:19.520 --> 12:23.840]  It's what it looks like is NATO is going to fully take Ukraine.
[12:23.840 --> 12:29.800]  The Western Ukrainian forces are now moving into the East in larger numbers and taking
[12:29.800 --> 12:35.360]  those buffer zones that have historically been Russian away.
[12:35.360 --> 12:40.360]  They're even talking about taking the Crimea away that was annexed in 2014 by Russia that
[12:40.360 --> 12:43.520]  is the historic birthplace of Russia.
[12:43.520 --> 12:45.440]  This is huge, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:45.440 --> 12:50.520]  And so what it looks like is the globalists are going to start a war and say the Russians
[12:50.520 --> 12:52.280]  started it.
[12:52.280 --> 12:57.200]  And of course, we've got this addled Crip Keeper president pumping in there and this
[12:57.200 --> 13:00.680]  whole thing is just a complete and total disaster.
[13:00.680 --> 13:02.440]  And we just pray for peace.
[13:02.440 --> 13:08.360]  But this could turn into a major regional conflict, not just a proxy war and potentially
[13:08.360 --> 13:13.840]  a nuclear war, as even Biden said on television while he was stuttering Friday.
[13:13.840 --> 13:17.480]  So this is just unbelievable information.
[13:17.480 --> 13:20.200]  So we have that.
[13:20.200 --> 13:25.640]  Then we have all of the insane COVID-19 information.
[13:25.640 --> 13:32.920]  I mean, one of these articles is so huge that when I got up this morning and saw it and
[13:32.920 --> 13:38.640]  read it, I just was speechless.
[13:38.640 --> 13:45.840]  My mouth was hanging open because I knew instantly when I saw the headline what the video was
[13:45.840 --> 13:48.920]  going to say because I already knew what they were doing and I predicted this and then they
[13:48.920 --> 13:49.920]  did it.
[13:49.920 --> 13:54.880]  I mean, it sure as hell I watched the video of the CEO of Pfizer hiding in plain view
[13:54.880 --> 14:02.080]  in a TV interview that, oh, we created COVID-19 in a lab and it's no big deal.
[14:02.080 --> 14:03.080]  That's not illegal.
[14:03.080 --> 14:04.080]  We do this all the time.
[14:04.080 --> 14:07.120]  We create all these new deadly viruses so we can make vaccines.
[14:07.120 --> 14:08.120]  We made it in the lab.
[14:08.120 --> 14:12.320]  It's purely synthetic, admitting beyond gain of function.
[14:12.320 --> 14:18.040]  Ever notice how they'll have one drug and then it's a new molecule so it takes the government
[14:18.040 --> 14:22.680]  a time to pass a law to then make that new substance illegal so they'll make different
[14:22.680 --> 14:25.840]  variants of, say, ecstasy or different variants of whatever.
[14:25.840 --> 14:26.840]  You read about synthetic drugs.
[14:26.840 --> 14:27.840]  Well, it's the same thing.
[14:27.840 --> 14:32.280]  He's saying, oh, this isn't gain of function because we made the whole thing.
[14:32.280 --> 14:36.960]  We went and studied and scanned wild viruses then made our own synthetic ones and spliced
[14:36.960 --> 14:37.960]  those.
[14:37.960 --> 14:38.960]  He said that.
[14:38.960 --> 14:43.560]  I have the video and the average person just hears it goes, oh, you're making purely synthetic
[14:43.560 --> 14:44.560]  viruses.
[14:44.560 --> 14:47.440]  How many times have I told you that's what this is because the top scientists scanned
[14:47.440 --> 14:52.000]  the virus two years ago who didn't work at Wuhan that Pfizer and others through Peter
[14:52.000 --> 14:58.080]  Dazik and Fauci were using to illegally do this crap and the scientists in India and
[14:58.080 --> 15:01.720]  Australia who have CRISPR scanners, multi-billion dollar pieces of equipment, looked at it
[15:01.720 --> 15:04.520]  and said, we can see the insertion points.
[15:04.520 --> 15:08.520]  These aren't just wild viruses that were spliced together in a lab.
[15:08.520 --> 15:14.520]  It appears to be purely synthetic, including the spike protein patented by Bill Gates and
[15:14.520 --> 15:15.520]  Fauci.
[15:15.520 --> 15:16.520]  Oh, yeah.
[15:16.520 --> 15:21.920]  I mean, it's like a serial number on a gun or a serial number where it was made and
[15:21.920 --> 15:28.040]  what on a carburetor or in a fuel injector system or, I mean, it has just like in Blade
[15:28.040 --> 15:35.760]  Runner folks where they go, oh, this snake, superior craftsmanship, it's got fricking
[15:35.760 --> 15:37.320]  numbers on it basically.
[15:37.320 --> 15:40.560]  I mean, they know it's synthetic.
[15:40.560 --> 15:41.560]  And so they know that's coming out.
[15:41.560 --> 15:45.920]  So they're like, oh, yeah, let me just come on a Sunday news show and tell you it's no
[15:45.920 --> 15:46.920]  big deal.
[15:46.920 --> 15:48.920]  We're making synthetic viruses, but it's not illegal.
[15:48.920 --> 15:54.920]  It's not going to function because we completely made new ones by scanning real ones.
[15:54.920 --> 16:00.520]  We'll be right back.
[16:00.520 --> 16:07.960]  The globalist social insiders always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[16:07.960 --> 16:11.160]  until the populations rebelled.
[16:11.160 --> 16:16.680]  They would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting
[16:16.680 --> 16:19.680]  anybody that speaks out against their lives.
[16:19.680 --> 16:25.120]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and
[16:25.120 --> 16:30.800]  whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[16:30.800 --> 16:35.080]  that it is a world government corporate takeover.
[16:35.080 --> 16:38.400]  And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever.
[16:38.400 --> 16:42.760]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[16:42.760 --> 16:49.120]  Like Canada, where they now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario and other
[16:49.120 --> 16:51.440]  areas of the world are following suit like Australia.
[16:51.440 --> 16:53.360]  So pray for these folks big time.
[16:53.360 --> 16:58.680]  It's a very serious situation and stay tuned into infowars.com because truth is absolutely
[16:58.680 --> 16:59.680]  paramount.
[16:59.680 --> 17:12.200]  If you only knew the power of the downside, join Bill Gates and together we will defeat
[17:12.200 --> 17:13.200]  humanity.
[17:13.200 --> 17:20.520]  Then our gods will reward us with eternal life.
[17:20.520 --> 17:24.960]  That's basically the ethos of the globalists.
[17:24.960 --> 17:31.040]  They must first play God, they must first prove that they are the fittest in their social
[17:31.040 --> 17:32.040]  Darwinistic system.
[17:32.040 --> 17:38.200]  And in a way they're right, if we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us and
[17:38.200 --> 17:42.880]  destroy our children's futures, the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open we really
[17:42.880 --> 17:45.600]  deserve what's happened to us.
[17:45.600 --> 17:51.960]  So I ask you now, are you going to step up and expose the dual war even more?
[17:51.960 --> 17:55.760]  I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts.
[17:55.760 --> 18:00.480]  The front lines of the fight is infowars.com.

[18:59.760 --> 19:01.280]  Mike in California, thanks for calling.
[19:01.280 --> 19:05.520]  I think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain of function research.
[19:05.520 --> 19:11.120]  Now if you read the actual you know 2014 legislation, the US government gain of function deliberative
[19:11.120 --> 19:16.920]  process and research funding pause on selected gain of function research involving influenza
[19:16.920 --> 19:18.120]  and MERS and ZARS viruses.
[19:18.120 --> 19:22.360]  There's nothing about ZARS like viruses and it's a research funding pause.
[19:22.360 --> 19:23.360]  It's not a stop.
[19:23.360 --> 19:24.360]  It's not a prohibition.
[19:24.360 --> 19:27.680]  It's when you come to a four-way intersection, there's the stop sign.
[19:27.680 --> 19:28.680]  You stop.
[19:28.680 --> 19:29.680]  You look both ways.
[19:29.680 --> 19:34.080]  There's no speed and so it's also it doesn't pause all gain of function just selected gain
[19:34.080 --> 19:38.600]  of function but they'll argue that this is actually characterization and qualification
[19:38.600 --> 19:42.720]  research so you know Rand and others you know maybe Fauci was right they don't quite know
[19:42.720 --> 19:45.800]  what they're talking about calling it gain of function you know that's why he didn't
[19:45.800 --> 19:46.800]  perjure himself.
[19:46.800 --> 19:50.160]  That's why he hasn't been arrested because they're literally creating new synthetic
[19:50.160 --> 19:54.720]  life forms that mimic what the viruses do but in the main definition it's still a gain
[19:54.720 --> 19:55.720]  of function.
[19:55.720 --> 19:58.240]  They're making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people.
[19:58.240 --> 19:59.240]  Thank you Mike.
[19:59.240 --> 20:00.240]  Thank you.
[20:00.240 --> 20:10.240]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:10.240 --> 20:24.640]  It's trending at the top of Twitter right now.
[20:24.640 --> 20:25.640]  It just broke.
[20:25.640 --> 20:30.440]  Roger Stone's joining us coming up last second of the hour a new version of the Mueller report
[20:30.440 --> 20:34.640]  has been released and reveals that Mueller declined to charge Donald Trump, Jr. and Roger
[20:34.640 --> 20:38.800]  Stone computer crimes because what they've been told and what the FBI had been given
[20:38.800 --> 20:44.720]  was a bunch of damn lies but the left had that all cut out of the report because it
[20:44.720 --> 20:51.480]  exonerated President Trump and Don Jr. who I can tell you Trump's got some problems and
[20:51.480 --> 20:56.400]  gets fooled and gets stabbed in the back but he's not a bad person and he's certainly not
[20:56.400 --> 20:58.720]  involved in sophisticated computer crimes.
[20:58.720 --> 21:00.000]  I can tell you that.
[21:00.000 --> 21:02.000]  I know what's going on.
[21:02.000 --> 21:06.000]  Who is involved in it is the deep state and the Democratic Party and the Soros affiliated
[21:06.000 --> 21:07.560]  groups and that's coming up.
[21:07.560 --> 21:08.560]  This is just huge.
[21:08.560 --> 21:09.560]  Okay.
[21:09.560 --> 21:11.720]  Let me get back to the COVID news here.
[21:11.720 --> 21:12.720]  Okay.
[21:12.720 --> 21:19.160]  And obviously tomorrow on the weekday show I'm going to drill into this in massive detail
[21:19.160 --> 21:24.160]  but go see the full video at infowars.com and article by Jamie White.
[21:24.160 --> 21:29.560]  Jamie has been working so hard to get all this out for you all weekend long.
[21:29.560 --> 21:38.360]  Bombshell, Pfizer CEO admits to COVID-19 created in lab and if you know the whole background
[21:38.360 --> 21:42.360]  it's got links to Peter Dazik in 2019 saying, oh we went and got all these viruses in the
[21:42.360 --> 21:48.240]  wild, coded them, then sent the codes back to Big Pharma so they could artificially
[21:48.240 --> 21:50.480]  create them.
[21:50.480 --> 21:51.720]  That's how high tech this is.
[21:51.720 --> 21:59.640]  Remember that cheesy 1990 movie Species where the radio telescope, SETI picks up a transmission
[21:59.640 --> 22:04.720]  that is how to create a genome of a certain type of creature in a human and so they make
[22:04.720 --> 22:11.920]  a gene change in a human and it looks like a normal human baby when it's born but it's
[22:11.920 --> 22:12.920]  not.
[22:12.920 --> 22:13.920]  It's an alien.
[22:13.920 --> 22:17.480]  Well that's a movie ladies and gentlemen.
[22:17.480 --> 22:19.120]  This is what they really do.
[22:19.120 --> 22:22.960]  They can now encode it, have the pieces of the virus, mix them however they want and
[22:22.960 --> 22:30.800]  then make new ones and then own the damn patent on it, Fauci, look it up, for HIV delivery
[22:30.800 --> 22:36.720]  system, put that as the rhinoceros horn on the virus they've created.
[22:36.720 --> 22:43.440]  It's totally synthetic and then claim it comes out of a wet market from some bats and somebody
[22:43.440 --> 22:48.480]  had sex with a turtle or something.
[22:48.480 --> 22:49.480]  This is so huge.
[22:49.480 --> 22:50.480]  So we have that.
[22:50.480 --> 22:55.160]  That's one article I could talk for five hours on that alone.
[22:55.160 --> 22:56.560]  This is so criminal.
[22:56.560 --> 23:02.000]  LinkedIn blocked links to natural immunity data including mainstream university studies
[23:02.000 --> 23:09.040]  on zinc, vitamin D, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, you name it.
[23:09.040 --> 23:15.280]  And the FBI even rated medical doctors prescribing vitamin C to people as a preventative.
[23:15.280 --> 23:16.520]  Wow.
[23:16.520 --> 23:19.040]  Talk about murdering people by keeping information away from them.
[23:19.040 --> 23:20.720]  Yeah, what's next, LinkedIn?
[23:20.720 --> 23:24.120]  If somebody says humans need oxygen, will you ban that?
[23:24.120 --> 23:28.080]  If Pfizer says oxygen is a bad substance, will the FBI rate us for it?
[23:28.080 --> 23:31.560]  Hell, you're already starting to ban carbon dioxide, the other life giving gas, I guess
[23:31.560 --> 23:32.560]  so.
[23:32.560 --> 23:36.440]  Man, these people are criminal.
[23:36.440 --> 23:42.000]  From updates, police forces attack and arrest convoy, freedom protesters around the world
[23:42.000 --> 23:48.160]  in France, in Australia, in New Zealand, and on the Big Ambassador Bridge from Detroit
[23:48.160 --> 23:49.880]  going into Canada.
[23:49.880 --> 23:53.320]  They cleaned that whole thing out, attacking people, then dragging them away.
[23:53.320 --> 23:57.400]  But most folks had left by the time they'd made their point being there over a week.
[23:57.400 --> 24:01.600]  They have not attacked the main peaceful group of tens of thousands of folks there in the
[24:01.600 --> 24:05.720]  capital of Ottawa who turned into a beautiful party and had their children with them, but
[24:05.720 --> 24:10.080]  I wouldn't put it past the wicked Trudeau to bring in outside forces and mercenaries
[24:10.080 --> 24:11.160]  to it.
[24:11.160 --> 24:16.760]  The police are in trouble for high-fiving and off-duty drinking beer and eating donuts
[24:16.760 --> 24:21.120]  and hot tubbing and bouncy castling with their fellow Canadians.
[24:21.120 --> 24:27.760]  But in places like France, brutal footage of people even in cafes being hit with tear
[24:27.760 --> 24:33.400]  gas and children getting hurt and armored vehicles slamming into people, there is just
[24:33.400 --> 24:39.280]  so much of that unfolding.
[24:39.280 --> 24:44.720]  Continuing, police arrest protesters blocking key border crossing between the U.S. and Canada
[24:44.720 --> 24:47.520]  nearing an end to the economic crisis.
[24:47.520 --> 24:49.520]  Again, amazing video.
[24:49.520 --> 24:54.680]  It's all in infowars.com, Australian police assault, pepper spray, Mad Max convoy driver.
[24:54.680 --> 24:57.680]  Not a lot to honk your horn.
[24:57.680 --> 25:00.080]  This is a very important video I'm going to play right now.
[25:00.080 --> 25:07.400]  Ian Paul encourages truckers to clog up cities as DHS scrambles to stop convoy from disrupting
[25:07.400 --> 25:08.400]  Super Bowl.
[25:08.400 --> 25:09.400]  And what'd he say?
[25:09.400 --> 25:13.600]  From slavery to civil rights to women's rights to everything.
[25:13.600 --> 25:16.640]  People are supposed to have civil disobedience when you're told we're going to put something
[25:16.640 --> 25:20.360]  in your body, we're going to track where you go, we're going to control what you're doing,
[25:20.360 --> 25:23.600]  we're going to illegally spy on you, we're going to destroy your borders, we're going
[25:23.600 --> 25:27.560]  to devalue your dollar, we're going to sell you out to foreign powers.
[25:27.560 --> 25:33.080]  People are supposed to do nonviolent things that let the system know we're in charge.
[25:33.080 --> 25:36.520]  But the globalists are so scared of this, so we need to have Rand Paul.
[25:36.520 --> 25:37.680]  Good job, Rand Paul.
[25:37.680 --> 25:41.360]  And other American leaders come out in defense of the truckers.
[25:41.360 --> 25:44.120]  We need shirts that say, I love the truckers.
[25:44.120 --> 25:46.040]  On the back, arrest Bill Gates.
[25:46.040 --> 25:47.040]  Here's Senator Paul.
[25:47.040 --> 25:51.960]  I also love to talk about this freedom convoy, the Canadian truckers who are protesting vaccine
[25:51.960 --> 25:54.760]  mandates for drivers will be crossing the border.
[25:54.760 --> 25:58.080]  We just heard this morning that there's a potential that there will be such a convoy
[25:58.080 --> 26:02.880]  in Los Angeles about the Super Bowl and perhaps one later in D.C.
[26:02.880 --> 26:04.080]  What do you make of all this?
[26:04.080 --> 26:05.080]  I'm all for it.
[26:05.080 --> 26:06.080]  Civil disobedience.
[26:06.080 --> 26:11.760]  Civil disobedience is a time-honored tradition in our country from slavery to civil rights
[26:11.760 --> 26:17.680]  to you name it, peaceful protest, clog things up, make people think about the mandates.
[26:17.680 --> 26:18.840]  And some of this we started.
[26:18.840 --> 26:22.600]  We put mandates on truckers coming across the border from Canada, so then they put mandates
[26:22.600 --> 26:23.600]  on.
[26:23.600 --> 26:24.600]  And the truckers are annoyed.
[26:24.600 --> 26:29.560]  They're invited in a cab by themselves, most of them, you know, for eight, 10-hour long
[26:29.560 --> 26:32.520]  halls and they just want to do what they want to do.
[26:32.520 --> 26:34.240]  It's their own business.
[26:34.240 --> 26:35.640]  And that's what healthcare used to be.
[26:35.640 --> 26:39.000]  It used to be your own business, what you and your doctor talked about or what medications
[26:39.000 --> 26:40.000]  you took.
[26:40.000 --> 26:41.000]  It wasn't anybody else's business.
[26:41.000 --> 26:44.720]  And it turns out that these injections don't work other than erasing your immune system
[26:44.720 --> 26:47.360]  and making you super sick.
[26:47.360 --> 26:55.160]  Meanwhile, Trudeau convenes incident response group for illegal blockades and occupiers.
[26:55.160 --> 26:57.040]  But what is the great reset?
[26:57.040 --> 26:58.040]  It's a blockade.
[26:58.040 --> 27:02.400]  It's a siege to shut down small businesses and to shut down churches and only let big
[27:02.400 --> 27:04.000]  box stores operate.
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.240]  It's corporate terrorism.
[27:06.240 --> 27:10.880]  And if you don't show your papers in French or German cafes, you get tear gas.
[27:10.880 --> 27:12.960]  You get attacked.
[27:12.960 --> 27:17.520]  This is the system trying to enforce the mark of the beast, and I don't have time to
[27:17.520 --> 27:21.160]  play all this, but you got to go look at this article on infowars.com.
[27:21.160 --> 27:23.600]  There's a bunch of videos and a bunch of photos.
[27:23.600 --> 27:24.600]  But look at this one.
[27:24.600 --> 27:28.800]  It says right here that kill the unvaccinated.
[27:28.800 --> 27:31.200]  And there's videos of this and communist flags.
[27:31.200 --> 27:35.720]  And you want to see the scum of the earth.
[27:35.720 --> 27:38.480]  Go look at the few thousand leftist commie government workers.
[27:38.480 --> 27:41.560]  I'm not saying all government workers are bad, but these are admittedly most government
[27:41.560 --> 27:47.200]  workers calling for an endless lockdown and saying they want masks on children forever.
[27:47.200 --> 27:48.680]  What a sick cult.
[27:48.680 --> 27:51.400]  And this is a really powerful article from BuzzFeed.
[27:51.400 --> 27:54.720]  I don't normally promote them, but it's so true and they're panicked.
[27:54.720 --> 27:57.320]  The Ottawa truckers have shown how to occupy a city.
[27:57.320 --> 28:02.080]  Now their movement's expanding worldwide, and he admits that this is how you do it.
[28:02.080 --> 28:08.240]  Not shooting people, not smoking crack, not setting up your communist utopia, but having
[28:08.240 --> 28:14.240]  a good time and peacefully occupying and they just, they're totally upset saying we don't
[28:14.240 --> 28:18.600]  know how to shut these people down.
[28:18.600 --> 28:22.560]  Ottawa police dealing with aggressive illegal behavior among anti-vaccine protesters, and
[28:22.560 --> 28:24.960]  then there's no evidence they're just making it up.
[28:24.960 --> 28:25.960]  Japan Times gets it right.
[28:25.960 --> 28:30.760]  The era of pandemic restrictions is fast coming to an end because the people have said they're
[28:30.760 --> 28:32.400]  not going to take it anymore.
[28:32.400 --> 28:39.280]  All drinking their delicious Canadian beer in makeshift hot tubs.
[28:39.280 --> 28:42.520]  All right, folks.
[28:42.520 --> 28:46.320]  By the way, Bill Maher has come out and said that Justin Trudeau is the new Hitler, and
[28:46.320 --> 28:48.400]  that what he's doing is Hitler-like.
[28:48.400 --> 28:49.400]  Yes!
[28:49.400 --> 28:50.400]  Yes!
[28:50.400 --> 28:52.080]  People are getting it now.
[28:52.080 --> 28:53.560]  Infowars.com.
[28:53.560 --> 28:55.000]  Tomorrow's news today.
[28:55.000 --> 28:59.840]  Stay with us.
[28:59.840 --> 29:07.280]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[29:07.280 --> 29:10.480]  until the populations rebelled.
[29:10.480 --> 29:16.000]  They would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting
[29:16.000 --> 29:18.840]  anybody that speaks out against their laws.
[29:18.840 --> 29:24.440]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and
[29:24.440 --> 29:30.120]  whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[29:30.120 --> 29:36.600]  that it is a world-government corporate takeover, and so it's pulling back the curtain now more
[29:36.600 --> 29:37.600]  than ever.
[29:37.600 --> 29:42.080]  The problem is some globalist-controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[29:42.080 --> 29:48.480]  Like Canada, they've now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario and other
[29:48.480 --> 29:50.840]  areas of the world are following suit, like Australia.
[29:50.840 --> 29:55.560]  So pray for these folks big time, this is a very serious situation, and stay tuned into
[29:55.560 --> 29:59.760]  Infowars.com because truth is absolutely paramount.
[29:59.760 --> 30:09.400]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the change
[30:09.400 --> 30:13.800]  that the medical tyranny combine controlled by the global private corporations has put
[30:13.800 --> 30:14.800]  in place.
[30:14.800 --> 30:20.960]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[30:20.960 --> 30:25.800]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal
[30:25.800 --> 30:28.720]  faces from the light of the sun.
[30:28.720 --> 30:36.880]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[30:36.880 --> 30:41.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now.
[30:41.280 --> 30:44.800]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[30:44.800 --> 30:48.200]  Clouds swab and the human admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of
[30:48.200 --> 30:51.040]  the world ID in carbon taxes.
[30:51.040 --> 30:53.200]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[30:53.200 --> 30:56.600]  They only get better if we resist and say no.
[30:56.600 --> 30:58.600]  Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[30:58.600 --> 31:02.080]  With the world awakening, I think what's important that we were on the momentum right
[31:02.080 --> 31:05.600]  now, take advantage of this moment, and I have all of an idea that something everybody
[31:05.600 --> 31:09.120]  can do, that every listener can do, I think it could be powerful and effective for us
[31:09.120 --> 31:11.560]  to, you know, hang the banners over highways.
[31:11.560 --> 31:15.920]  Imagine if you're not being an artiste in Atlanta, it says Alex Jones is right in the
[31:15.920 --> 31:19.720]  war stop farm where we stand with the truckers or rest out or whatever it is that they did.
[31:19.720 --> 31:22.160]  Brother, I'm so glad you called elaborate on this.
[31:22.160 --> 31:23.160]  Yes.
[31:23.160 --> 31:26.640]  Now is the time in your small town or your big city to write something on the bathroom
[31:26.640 --> 31:32.440]  wall or to put a sticker on your car or banner hangs over highways and it will be a chain
[31:32.440 --> 31:33.440]  reaction.
[31:33.440 --> 31:35.320]  What do you recommend people say on these banner hangs?
[31:35.320 --> 31:40.320]  I have a few ideas, first of all, Alex Jones is right in the war stop farm, rest out, rest
[31:40.320 --> 31:41.320]  out, swap.
[31:41.320 --> 31:42.320]  The vaccine is poison.
[31:42.320 --> 31:43.320]  There's kinds of things.
[31:43.320 --> 31:45.320]  I say just keep it short, keep it concise.
[31:45.320 --> 31:46.320]  No, I agree.
[31:46.320 --> 31:47.320]  Arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates.
[31:47.320 --> 31:48.920]  The COVID-19 vaccine is poison.
[31:48.920 --> 31:49.920]  Beautiful.
[31:49.920 --> 31:50.920]  Yeah.
[31:50.920 --> 31:52.920]  There's ways that we could all be involved and we could all be effective though.
[31:52.920 --> 31:53.920]  That's what I'm calling about.
[31:53.920 --> 31:54.920]  God bless you, Chris.
[31:54.920 --> 31:58.160]  In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today.
[31:58.160 --> 32:06.520]  Thank you so much.
[32:06.520 --> 32:12.480]  From the words of Chuck Paul and Eke's Fight Club, dear globalist leaders of the Great
[32:12.480 --> 32:17.160]  Reset, the people you're trying to step on, we're everyone you depend on.
[32:17.160 --> 32:21.520]  We're the people who do your laundry and cook your food and serve your dinner.
[32:21.520 --> 32:26.720]  We make your bed, we guard you while you're asleep, we drive the ambulances, we direct
[32:26.720 --> 32:27.720]  your call.
[32:27.720 --> 32:31.760]  We are cooks and we are taxi drivers and we know everything about you.
[32:31.760 --> 32:35.080]  We process your insurance claims and credit card charges.
[32:35.080 --> 32:37.880]  We control every part of your life.
[32:37.880 --> 32:42.560]  We are the middle children of history, raised by television to believe that someday we'll
[32:42.560 --> 32:44.920]  be millionaires and movie stars.
[32:44.920 --> 32:45.920]  But we won't.
[32:45.920 --> 32:46.920]  And we're just learning this fact.
[32:46.920 --> 32:47.920]  So don't f**k with us.
[32:47.920 --> 33:01.240]  Support independent media at infoorstore.com.
[33:01.240 --> 33:18.760]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:18.760 --> 33:24.720]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, we now take you live to the Central Texas
[33:24.720 --> 33:31.720]  Command Center and the heart of the resistance, it's Alex Jones.
[33:31.720 --> 33:35.320]  All right, I did a three hour special Saturday show here today.
[33:35.320 --> 33:36.320]  It's really powerful.
[33:36.320 --> 33:42.520]  It's posted at man.video, talked to actually one of the top reporters in Russia who's got
[33:42.520 --> 33:46.400]  family in Ukraine about what's really happening there, need to go watch it later.
[33:46.400 --> 33:52.080]  I was going to take today off and take care of a lot of accounting and business I have.
[33:52.080 --> 33:55.520]  That's what I do most of the time when I take it off the show is take care of planning and
[33:55.520 --> 33:59.320]  a lot of new projects we're working on that are very close to being done, but we're behind
[33:59.320 --> 34:00.320]  a few months on.
[34:00.320 --> 34:02.080]  So I'm a very busy person.
[34:02.080 --> 34:05.000]  I appreciate all your support and prayers to give me the energy to get that done.
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.880]  I can fill your prayers and your support.
[34:07.880 --> 34:09.840]  You're the wind in our sails.
[34:09.840 --> 34:12.440]  But I had to come in tonight because of all this news.
[34:12.440 --> 34:15.040]  I won't get to it all, but tomorrow I will.
[34:15.040 --> 34:16.960]  Jason Burmos was loaded for bear.
[34:16.960 --> 34:18.320]  He really prepares for shows.
[34:18.320 --> 34:19.320]  It's first rate.
[34:19.320 --> 34:25.840]  He'll host the second hour when Owen wants to come in tonight as well for Sunday Live
[34:25.840 --> 34:27.120]  and that is 6 to 8 p.m.
[34:27.120 --> 34:29.920]  So get ready for all of that.
[34:29.920 --> 34:35.800]  I mean, seriously, there's no way to do any of this justice, the stuff that's coming
[34:35.800 --> 34:36.800]  out.
[34:36.800 --> 34:41.320]  Let me shift gears back to what we were just covering last segment.
[34:41.320 --> 34:44.840]  So Senator Paul comes out and many others do and say, this is good civil disobedience.
[34:44.840 --> 34:49.080]  This is good to say we're sick of government locking us down, bankrupting us, trying to
[34:49.080 --> 34:50.560]  put things in our body.
[34:50.560 --> 34:52.360]  That's tyranny.
[34:52.360 --> 34:55.960]  And then we've got all the compilations of mainstream corporate news calling them terrorists
[34:55.960 --> 35:02.120]  and traitors and arrest them and slash their tires and burn them down and shoot them and
[35:02.120 --> 35:07.680]  just crazy leftist garbage foaming at the mouth.
[35:07.680 --> 35:11.280]  But then when they burn down, billions of dollars of stuff kill dozens of people, kill
[35:11.280 --> 35:16.840]  five cops in the summer of rage in 2000, it's a good thing.
[35:16.840 --> 35:26.720]  And then the vice presidential candidate bails murderers out of jail, a murderer in one case.
[35:26.720 --> 35:28.880]  So look at what's currently happening.
[35:28.880 --> 35:33.520]  Suspected antifa activists busted with pipe bomb with direct action plan written down
[35:33.520 --> 35:42.920]  and the bombs planning to go to a Jan 6 rally and bomb people, the Soros DA has let him out
[35:42.920 --> 35:43.920]  of jail on bond.
[35:43.920 --> 35:48.880]  So that's what's going on there.
[35:48.880 --> 35:49.880]  And why is that important?
[35:49.880 --> 35:52.400]  Well, that ties into the larger picture of what's going on.
[35:52.400 --> 35:59.760]  Here's his actual bond released on his own recognizance, no money put down.
[35:59.760 --> 36:04.440]  People that walked into the Capitol peacefully, still in solitary confinement in some cases.
[36:04.440 --> 36:07.040]  People that were outside the Capitol like the Green Beret guy that tried to stop the
[36:07.040 --> 36:08.040]  violence.
[36:08.040 --> 36:09.040]  He's in solitary confinement.
[36:09.040 --> 36:10.040]  Look at this.
[36:10.040 --> 36:16.720]  Austin is the Fox News today, Austin DA launches over 20 grand jury cases against cops who responded
[36:16.720 --> 36:19.480]  during George Floyd riots in Austin.
[36:19.480 --> 36:21.160]  I was here.
[36:21.160 --> 36:27.280]  They weren't just shutting down I-35 like the truckers do peacefully.
[36:27.280 --> 36:32.000]  They were running out in front of cars, aiming guns at people and beating people up and burning
[36:32.000 --> 36:35.640]  cars and burning homeless encampments.
[36:35.640 --> 36:44.160]  The police shot them with beanbags and the DA literally put in an office by Soros by $800,000
[36:44.160 --> 36:49.320]  is trying to put 20 police in prison.
[36:49.320 --> 36:55.200]  Oh, by the way, they were shooting fireworks, those big explosive mortars at the police as
[36:55.200 --> 36:56.200]  well.
[36:56.200 --> 37:00.520]  So just remember that and let all that sink in.
[37:00.520 --> 37:07.320]  Okay, ahead of Roger Stone joining us in the next segment on the huge illegal spying against
[37:07.320 --> 37:11.560]  Trump himself, myself and all the documents, they're coming out via the Justice Department
[37:11.560 --> 37:12.560]  of all places.
[37:12.560 --> 37:13.560]  Good.
[37:13.560 --> 37:15.600]  I'm glad they're doing the right thing.
[37:15.600 --> 37:19.640]  But even the people in corrupt government circles know, I mean, you can't have the CIA
[37:19.640 --> 37:25.680]  and the FBI and private intelligence groups spying on the president and candidate president
[37:25.680 --> 37:26.680]  and the president.
[37:26.680 --> 37:29.040]  I mean, it's just next level, folks.
[37:29.040 --> 37:32.280]  It's an internal, deep state coup and it proves it all.
[37:32.280 --> 37:33.280]  That's coming up.
[37:33.280 --> 37:38.280]  But I wanted to play this short little clip because it's so informative and it's also
[37:38.280 --> 37:39.280]  a trend.
[37:39.280 --> 37:40.280]  It's bigger than Alex Jones.
[37:40.280 --> 37:42.760]  When you stand up for Alex Jones, when you stand up for Tucker Carlson, when you stand
[37:42.760 --> 37:46.200]  up for Joe Rogan, you stand up for everybody's free speech and nobody's more canceled than
[37:46.200 --> 37:47.200]  I am.
[37:47.200 --> 37:51.360]  And so there's a trend of really prominent people coming out saying Alex Jones isn't
[37:51.360 --> 37:52.360]  a bad guy.
[37:52.360 --> 37:54.440]  In fact, he's better than the mainstream media.
[37:54.440 --> 37:58.680]  He gets things wrong sometimes and apologizes, but it's right most of the time.
[37:58.680 --> 38:01.760]  The corporate media is lying on purpose.
[38:01.760 --> 38:04.800]  So this is a lot bigger than Alex Jones.
[38:04.800 --> 38:09.080]  I'm not up there playing this clip because Marjorie Taylor Greene went and visited Tim
[38:09.080 --> 38:11.840]  Poole and talked about Alex Jones.
[38:11.840 --> 38:17.640]  I'm playing it because they get the trend of defending people that are marked and targeted
[38:17.640 --> 38:19.800]  is defending themselves.
[38:19.800 --> 38:21.240]  And so I defend MTG.
[38:21.240 --> 38:24.760]  I defend Tim Poole when they're trying to cancel him, which they've been doing.
[38:24.760 --> 38:27.480]  We all defend each other in our right to free speech.
[38:27.480 --> 38:33.080]  Even if we disagree with what we say to each other or to others sometime, that's the American
[38:33.080 --> 38:34.080]  way.
[38:34.080 --> 38:35.360]  And I know as an audience, you get that.
[38:35.360 --> 38:39.480]  What I'm saying is we've got to stand up now and say no to the cancel culture and the
[38:39.480 --> 38:42.680]  dying corporate media that wants to be able to shut down all their competition because
[38:42.680 --> 38:45.720]  being able to communicate with each other is paramount.
[38:45.720 --> 38:46.880]  Here's part of the clip.
[38:46.880 --> 38:49.200]  See the full clip at infowars.com.
[38:49.200 --> 38:52.480]  Who canceled today that you had to invite Marjorie and I?
[38:52.480 --> 38:53.480]  Who canceled?
[38:53.480 --> 38:54.480]  We canceled them?
[38:54.480 --> 38:57.480]  We were like, everyone get out, Marjorie and Thomas are coming.
[38:57.480 --> 38:58.480]  It was Alex Jones.
[38:58.480 --> 38:59.480]  No, it wasn't.
[38:59.480 --> 39:00.480]  I love Alex.
[39:00.480 --> 39:01.480]  I love Alex.
[39:01.480 --> 39:02.480]  I love him.
[39:02.480 --> 39:03.480]  Alex Jones is the greatest.
[39:03.480 --> 39:04.480]  Dude, he's such a kind man.
[39:04.480 --> 39:05.480]  He has been so canceled.
[39:05.480 --> 39:06.480]  Oh yeah.
[39:06.480 --> 39:09.480]  He's a wild entertainer and a brilliant man.
[39:09.480 --> 39:10.480]  Isn't he fantastic?
[39:10.480 --> 39:11.480]  And no one is perfect.
[39:11.480 --> 39:12.480]  No one is perfect.
[39:12.480 --> 39:14.880]  And everyone is capable of incredible violence and incredible love.
[39:14.880 --> 39:15.880]  So yeah.
[39:15.880 --> 39:17.360]  Shout out to Alex Jones.
[39:17.360 --> 39:18.360]  We love you.
[39:18.360 --> 39:23.920]  And I have no problem like they try and I don't know what these leftist media personalities
[39:23.920 --> 39:28.200]  think they're getting by trying to insult me or, you know, accuse me of things because
[39:28.200 --> 39:30.960]  I literally don't care and it's not going to change my, I'm never going to bend the
[39:30.960 --> 39:33.400]  knee to their stupid whims or whatever.
[39:33.400 --> 39:35.600]  Alex Jones is a journalist and member of the media.
[39:35.600 --> 39:36.600]  End of story.
[39:36.600 --> 39:37.760]  You don't, you can say he's wrong.
[39:37.760 --> 39:38.840]  You can say he's fake news.
[39:38.840 --> 39:41.280]  You could accuse him of being incorrect and not fact checking.
[39:41.280 --> 39:45.400]  And I think there's valid criticism in a lot of what Alex Jones says absolutely.
[39:45.400 --> 39:47.040]  But he runs a media organization.
[39:47.040 --> 39:52.560]  And so when the January 6th committee subpoenas him, they're basically violating our first
[39:52.560 --> 39:54.200]  amendment protections.
[39:54.200 --> 39:59.120]  The press isn't supposed to be, you know, the press can say what they want to say.
[39:59.120 --> 40:03.320]  And, and, and, you know, I love this was really going to offend them all.
[40:03.320 --> 40:09.840]  Alex Jones is a journalist the same as Brian Stelter and Jake Tapper and Don Lemon are.
[40:09.840 --> 40:10.840]  Absolutely.
[40:10.840 --> 40:11.840]  I was about to say the same thing.
[40:11.840 --> 40:14.040]  But some people are going to be like, don't insult Alex that way.
[40:14.040 --> 40:16.280]  Well, yeah, yeah, Alex Jones never lied us into a war.
[40:16.280 --> 40:17.280]  Right, right, right.
[40:17.280 --> 40:18.280]  That's true.
[40:18.280 --> 40:22.520]  And why does the New York Times and CNN get to say that Trump is guilty?
[40:22.520 --> 40:23.520]  Of Russia collusion?
[40:23.520 --> 40:24.520]  Yes.
[40:24.520 --> 40:25.520]  When it was never proven.
[40:25.520 --> 40:27.520]  That was a real conspiracy theory.
[40:27.520 --> 40:28.520]  Yeah.
[40:28.520 --> 40:29.520]  I want to make a point.
[40:29.520 --> 40:33.040]  You don't have to try and prove you're a journalist to enjoy First Amendment protection.
[40:33.040 --> 40:34.040]  Also.
[40:34.040 --> 40:35.040]  Yeah, exactly.
[40:35.040 --> 40:38.120]  There are occasionally, you know, the big newspapers will come to Congress with suggestions
[40:38.120 --> 40:41.280]  for extra protections that they might receive.
[40:41.280 --> 40:46.520]  And it should extend to anybody, whether there's one person listening to your podcast or whether
[40:46.520 --> 40:52.560]  there are 10 million people subscribing to your newspaper.
[40:52.560 --> 40:53.800]  And that's exactly what's going on.
[40:53.800 --> 40:58.280]  So the reason I raise this is here's a big article out of the Guardian of all places
[40:58.280 --> 41:02.440]  who just as discredited, just as bad as CNN, who lie on purpose.
[41:02.440 --> 41:03.600]  I don't lie on purpose.
[41:03.600 --> 41:08.760]  I get things wrong, though, scandals, firings and tabloid like news.
[41:08.760 --> 41:10.760]  What is happening at CNN?
[41:10.760 --> 41:13.920]  I mean, even though I was a sociopath, I'd want to tell you the truth and be ahead of
[41:13.920 --> 41:14.920]  the news.
[41:14.920 --> 41:17.800]  I'm not a sociopath, but I mean, that's how you get popular.
[41:17.800 --> 41:21.120]  People like you when you give them good tips, when you're accurate, when you know what you're
[41:21.120 --> 41:22.120]  talking about.
[41:22.120 --> 41:24.880]  Not when you're lying to them on purpose.
[41:24.880 --> 41:25.880]  People want justice.
[41:25.880 --> 41:26.960]  They want truth.
[41:26.960 --> 41:30.360]  And I'm trying to deliver it as best I can, though I'm an imperfect soul like everybody
[41:30.360 --> 41:31.360]  else.
[41:31.360 --> 41:34.000]  But it goes over the whole collapse of CNN and how it's collapsing.
[41:34.000 --> 41:38.200]  I mean, you talk about tomorrow's news today.
[41:38.200 --> 41:41.480]  Nobody's been more accurate on the real stuff going on in the world than we have.
[41:41.480 --> 41:42.480]  And that's all by the grace of God.
[41:42.480 --> 41:45.720]  So look at this latest video on infowars.com and band off video.
[41:45.720 --> 41:53.760]  Going back to April, May, June and July of 2020, lockdowns will loosen then tighten again.
[41:53.760 --> 41:57.440]  And I predict everything that happened in the next two years perfectly because I know
[41:57.440 --> 42:01.280]  the enemy.
[42:01.280 --> 42:06.000]  Just like I, it's not about me, me, me, but it's about we know what we're talking about
[42:06.000 --> 42:09.640]  when they're trying to shut us down saying we're liars or we're wrong or we're stupid.
[42:09.640 --> 42:14.280]  Just like we told you exactly how they were spying on Trump and exactly who was doing
[42:14.280 --> 42:16.160]  it and who the organizations were.
[42:16.160 --> 42:17.640]  And how did we do that?
[42:17.640 --> 42:22.920]  I'll tell you how we did it when we come back with Roger Stone.
[42:22.920 --> 42:23.920]  This is a big deal.
[42:23.920 --> 42:28.440]  Please don't forget, it's the last couple of days to get 25% off on super high quality
[42:28.440 --> 42:30.680]  swarable food that's ready to ship to you right now.
[42:30.680 --> 42:32.720]  We haven't done 25% off in four years.
[42:32.720 --> 42:33.720]  It's fresh.
[42:33.720 --> 42:34.720]  It's quality.
[42:34.720 --> 42:35.720]  It's the best deal you're going to get.
[42:35.720 --> 42:41.400]  So go to infowarstore.com or preparewithalex.com, take you to the same sub-site on the page
[42:41.400 --> 42:43.640]  and that funds our operation as well.
[42:43.640 --> 42:44.640]  Everybody needs to get prepared.
[42:44.640 --> 42:50.360]  And X3 is 50% off the good deep earth crystal iodine with two other types.
[42:50.360 --> 42:51.360]  You can't beat it.

[42:52.360 --> 43:00.240]  Take your immune system to the next level and more with X3 at infowarstore.com.
[43:00.240 --> 43:04.360]  Sold out for months, X3 is now back in stock.
[43:04.360 --> 43:08.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing, our products are game changing
[43:08.240 --> 43:11.800]  and so many people are deficient in iodine.
[43:11.800 --> 43:13.840]  It's not the soil anymore.
[43:13.840 --> 43:15.760]  Most of the ocean is contaminated.
[43:15.760 --> 43:21.120]  But when you get high quality tri-iodine, all three of the healthy types together, it
[43:21.120 --> 43:25.720]  does amazing things for your stamina, your libido, but most importantly your immune
[43:25.720 --> 43:26.720]  system.

[43:32.720 --> 43:36.400]  again at 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[43:36.400 --> 43:40.240]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body takes about
[43:40.240 --> 43:44.600]  two weeks to get on average, you really need to experience X3.
[43:44.600 --> 43:47.320]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, they're going to be reordering it.
[43:47.320 --> 43:51.360]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing
[43:51.360 --> 43:52.360]  what it does for your body.
[43:52.360 --> 43:57.080]  It's the good halogen, the bad halogen, and it funds the info or a true 360 win.
[43:57.080 --> 44:00.720]  So again, X3, back in stock, 50% off for a limited time.
[44:00.720 --> 44:05.600]  With all the craziness going on in the world, with the globalists plotting their next big
[44:05.600 --> 44:10.840]  lockdown, with the next phase of the Great Reset being a stage-cyber attack, with the
[44:10.840 --> 44:17.400]  deep state pushing a civil war, not just here, but in Europe and war with Russia, with the
[44:17.400 --> 44:23.200]  massive inflation and all the other garbage that's taking place, like supply chain breakdowns,
[44:23.200 --> 44:29.480]  you need to get prepared now with high-quality, storeable food that is ready to ship.
[44:29.480 --> 44:34.560]  And it's been four years since my Patriot supply at PrepareWithAlex.com has offered their
[44:34.560 --> 44:39.480]  storeable food at 25% off, four years.
[44:39.480 --> 44:45.840]  But right now, it's 25% off until February 13th, 2022, a little over two weeks from the
[44:45.840 --> 44:54.160]  time I'm cutting this to get 25% off at PrepareWithAlex.com on the entire catalog of my Patriot supply.
[44:54.160 --> 44:56.160]  Act now, get prepared now.
[44:56.160 --> 45:01.960]  This is absolutely essential for everybody that wants to be self-sufficient.
[45:01.960 --> 45:08.640]  Something very rare is going on, and it ends in just three days, as of the time I'm taping
[45:08.640 --> 45:12.080]  this announcement on Thursday afternoon.
[45:12.080 --> 45:17.720]  Coming up this Monday, the biggest sale in four years of high-quality, storeable foods
[45:17.720 --> 45:20.720]  at PrepareWithAlex.com will end.
[45:20.720 --> 45:22.240]  That's 25% off.
[45:22.240 --> 45:27.520]  Already the lowest prices are going to find on high-quality, storeable food at infoarstore.com.
[45:27.520 --> 45:36.200]  Again, you can go to PrepareWithAlex.com or infoarstore.com, and it takes you to the same
[45:36.200 --> 45:37.200]  place.
[45:37.200 --> 45:45.920]  50% off as well from super-high-quality products like X3, The Deep Earth, Crystal Eye and Eye.
[45:45.920 --> 45:48.120]  That sale is going on as well.
[45:48.120 --> 45:49.120]  It doesn't end on Monday.
[45:49.120 --> 45:53.040]  It'll end in a few weeks, and we're almost sold out of the product.
[45:53.040 --> 45:56.760]  Everybody needs to have storeable food, be prepared, so become self-sufficient now, and
[45:56.760 --> 46:00.080]  the best high-quality food at the lowest prices at infoarstore.com.
[46:00.080 --> 46:07.400]  Cobra Commander here, with an important message to humanity.
[46:07.400 --> 46:15.080]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection, so that you will be safe.
[46:15.080 --> 46:18.080]  But the injection is not ready yet.
[46:18.080 --> 46:27.520]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the cans.
[46:27.520 --> 46:36.000]  I also need you to wear masks, and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[46:36.000 --> 46:42.920]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that
[46:42.920 --> 46:46.320]  only I own profitable.
[46:46.320 --> 46:53.680]  You will then be my slave, oh, and then you'll get that special shot of freedom from Cobra,
[46:53.680 --> 47:00.280]  it will remove your immune system, so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable
[47:00.280 --> 47:01.280]  lives.
[47:01.280 --> 47:18.840]  The leading of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:18.840 --> 47:25.120]  Wow, you talk about super quadruple vindication.
[47:25.120 --> 47:32.040]  Roger's going to join us for a whole hour tomorrow, because we're going to unpack this.
[47:32.040 --> 47:36.520]  Napolitano's vindicated, I'm vindicated, Roger's vindicated.
[47:36.520 --> 47:39.600]  We now learn that they scrubbed the Mueller report that they knew Roger was innocent,
[47:39.600 --> 47:40.600]  basically.
[47:40.600 --> 47:44.720]  So much is breaking, but illegally spying on the candidate and when he was president.
[47:44.720 --> 47:48.480]  How did Roger Stone and I know that, and how did Napolitano know that?
[47:48.480 --> 47:52.440]  Because he checked from our sources and his after we broke it and confirmed it.
[47:52.440 --> 47:54.600]  We'll tell you in a moment.
[47:54.600 --> 47:58.360]  But first, here's Leslie Stahl on 60 Minutes, interviews Trump Friday.
[47:58.360 --> 48:02.880]  This is breaking then, he brings it up, she says it's a lie, and now the details are out
[48:02.880 --> 48:07.480]  with the documents from the raid on Hillary's former chief lawyer that they were running
[48:07.480 --> 48:12.400]  private groups worse than the plumbers breaking in to the president's computers.
[48:12.400 --> 48:13.400]  This is huge.
[48:13.400 --> 48:14.400]  Here's the clip.
[48:14.400 --> 48:18.240]  So the biggest scandal was when they spied on my campaign.
[48:18.240 --> 48:19.240]  They spied on my campaign.
[48:19.240 --> 48:21.240]  Yeah, there's no real evidence of that.
[48:21.240 --> 48:22.240]  Of course there is.
[48:22.240 --> 48:23.240]  It's all over the place.
[48:23.240 --> 48:24.240]  Leslie.
[48:24.240 --> 48:25.240]  It's all over.
[48:25.240 --> 48:26.240]  They spied on my campaign and they got caught.
[48:26.240 --> 48:32.640]  Can I say something, you know, this is 60 Minutes and we can't put on things we can't
[48:32.640 --> 48:33.640]  verify.
[48:33.640 --> 48:34.640]  You won't put it on because it's bad for Biden.
[48:34.640 --> 48:36.920]  We can't put on things we can't verify.
[48:36.920 --> 48:38.600]  Leslie, they spied on my campaign.
[48:38.600 --> 48:39.600]  Well, we can't verify that.
[48:39.600 --> 48:41.680]  It's been totally verified.
[48:41.680 --> 48:44.260]  It's been just go down and get the papers.
[48:44.260 --> 48:46.520]  They spied on my campaign, they got caught.
[48:46.520 --> 48:47.520]  No.
[48:47.520 --> 48:50.200]  And then they went much further than that and they got caught.
[48:50.200 --> 48:53.680]  And you will see that Leslie, and you know that, but you just don't want to put it on
[48:53.680 --> 48:54.680]  the campaign.
[48:54.680 --> 48:56.920]  As a matter of fact, I don't know that.
[48:56.920 --> 48:59.000]  Talk about having something blow up in your face.
[48:59.000 --> 49:02.280]  They run this promo all weekend knowing what he said is true.
[49:02.280 --> 49:06.360]  Now reportedly the show's out and they attacking more saying it's not true.
[49:06.360 --> 49:07.360]  These people are crazy.
[49:07.360 --> 49:10.360]  Roger Stone, how big a deal is this?
[49:10.360 --> 49:12.720]  Alex, this is enormous.
[49:12.720 --> 49:20.280]  First of all, Special Counsel John Durham says in his latest filings, how's that Leslie?
[49:20.280 --> 49:25.440]  Here's your proof right there in a federal court filing by a special counsel who says
[49:25.440 --> 49:31.240]  definitively that Trump was being spied on at the Trump Tower during the time he was
[49:31.240 --> 49:32.240]  running for president.
[49:32.240 --> 49:36.840]  Now, correct me if I'm wrong, Alex, wasn't that what Watergate was all about?
[49:36.840 --> 49:37.840]  Yes.
[49:37.840 --> 49:42.800]  Wasn't that about Nixon's plumbers breaking into the Watergate to spy on the Democrats
[49:42.800 --> 49:44.520]  and the McGovern campaign?
[49:44.520 --> 49:48.160]  So this is a scandal far bigger than Watergate.
[49:48.160 --> 49:55.360]  It is nothing less than the use of the full legal authority and the extraordinary capabilities
[49:55.360 --> 50:00.440]  of our intelligence agencies to spy on the Republican candidate for president.
[50:00.440 --> 50:01.600]  And now they are busted.
[50:01.600 --> 50:02.960]  They are caught red-handed.
[50:02.960 --> 50:06.440]  Leslie Stahl owes the American people an apology.
[50:06.440 --> 50:08.360]  You see, we're info wars.
[50:08.360 --> 50:13.360]  We can't just put stuff on the air that we can't prove and we just proved this.
[50:13.360 --> 50:15.920]  Roger, I'm going to have the clips tomorrow.
[50:15.920 --> 50:21.120]  We already found some because of time, CNN, ABC News, New York Times attacking us by name
[50:21.120 --> 50:25.720]  saying we were insane liars, that no one infiltrated the servers at Trump Tower, that
[50:25.720 --> 50:28.360]  no one was spying on him as a candidate or president.
[50:28.360 --> 50:33.880]  But I remember they bragged that there was a national security investigation during the
[50:33.880 --> 50:38.680]  end of the campaign and said they had proof from wiretaps he was a Russian agent using
[50:38.680 --> 50:39.680]  the archaic term.
[50:39.680 --> 50:41.040]  And then we checked with a lot of sources.
[50:41.040 --> 50:44.440]  They said, indeed, it was going on and illegal and came up empty.
[50:44.440 --> 50:48.120]  So first they admit the illegal spying, then they said they never said that and now they're
[50:48.120 --> 50:49.600]  caught red-handed doing it.
[50:49.600 --> 50:50.600]  This is insane, Roger.
[50:50.600 --> 50:53.920]  Yeah, it is absolutely enormous.
[50:53.920 --> 50:55.920]  This is a bombshell.
[50:55.920 --> 51:01.400]  And the president is completely vindicated by friend Judge Napolitano, who said this
[51:01.400 --> 51:04.240]  and was vilified by the mainstream media.
[51:04.240 --> 51:05.960]  He is now vindicated.
[51:05.960 --> 51:12.480]  Yesterday, and we'll talk about this tomorrow, they released their final secret report that
[51:12.480 --> 51:17.120]  said that I was spared charges in the Russian hacking case.
[51:17.120 --> 51:22.080]  That's because there was no evidence of my involvement whatsoever in the Russian hacking
[51:22.080 --> 51:23.080]  case.
[51:23.080 --> 51:27.200]  So no charges, pardon me, no evidence, no crime, no charges.
[51:27.200 --> 51:28.700]  Why did they release this?
[51:28.700 --> 51:35.280]  They released this to blunt this news today, which definitively proves that the Obama
[51:35.280 --> 51:40.600]  administration was spying on the candidate Donald Trump in 2016.
[51:40.600 --> 51:43.160]  A crime far bigger than Watergate.
[51:43.160 --> 51:48.880]  They just dwarfs Watergate, and they are completely busted.
[51:48.880 --> 51:53.600]  They are here some of the headlines Clinton campaign paid to infiltrate Trump Tower White
[51:53.600 --> 51:58.400]  House servers to link Trump to Russian, says federal filings they have the documents.
[51:58.400 --> 52:03.120]  Bigger than Watergate, Trump furious at Redurham spy scandal bombshell demands prosecutions,
[52:03.120 --> 52:04.120]  reparations.
[52:04.120 --> 52:06.640]  I hope Donald Trump sues them all for everything.
[52:06.640 --> 52:09.920]  This is the biggest scandal we've ever seen.
[52:09.920 --> 52:11.960]  Dylan Greenwald says the same thing.
[52:11.960 --> 52:16.920]  Durham says Democrat allied tech executive spied on Trump's White House office.
[52:16.920 --> 52:21.800]  Trump responds, punishable by death he's saying it is treason to spy on the president.
[52:21.800 --> 52:26.360]  Clinton allies spied on Trump White House, internet traffic Durham confirms.
[52:26.360 --> 52:29.520]  Gates predicts Jan 6 committee will try to disqualify Trump.
[52:29.520 --> 52:30.960]  What does this do now though?
[52:30.960 --> 52:34.080]  And then it just goes on and on from there.
[52:34.080 --> 52:39.000]  Evidence shows Hillary team paid tech company to infiltrate servers in Trump Tower and
[52:39.000 --> 52:45.040]  later in the White House, continuing Liz Cheney's husband is partner at the place that runs
[52:45.040 --> 52:49.560]  on behalf of the companies like the China's military and individual connected spying on
[52:49.560 --> 52:50.560]  President Trump.
[52:50.560 --> 52:51.920]  I mean, this is a mess.
[52:51.920 --> 52:57.960]  And then here's the articles with Alex Jones and Roger Stone demonized back in 2017.
[52:57.960 --> 52:59.360]  Did Obama wiretap Trump?
[52:59.360 --> 53:00.360]  No.
[53:00.360 --> 53:05.160]  But it was just one of the president's and GOP's top conspiracy theories in 17.
[53:05.160 --> 53:06.160]  Boom.
[53:06.160 --> 53:11.640]  It shows full Alex Jones, a spy gate falls apart, Vanity Fair, Trump media allies push
[53:11.640 --> 53:16.160]  spy gate conspiracy, Alex Jones, Boston Globe reports, and of course, you're in all these
[53:16.160 --> 53:19.000]  articles, Roger Fox News, all of it.
[53:19.000 --> 53:20.680]  Are we not completely vindicated?
[53:20.680 --> 53:22.800]  I mean, this is just gigantic.
[53:22.800 --> 53:24.440]  How much this discredits them?
[53:24.440 --> 53:27.320]  You're absolutely right, Alex.
[53:27.320 --> 53:29.360]  They are busted big time.
[53:29.360 --> 53:32.200]  Now watch them try to bury this immediately.
[53:32.200 --> 53:35.520]  See that's how that's how the mainstream media works.
[53:35.520 --> 53:37.640]  And they are caught red handed.
[53:37.640 --> 53:40.200]  They will come up with some new scandal.
[53:40.200 --> 53:41.440]  So this is yesterday.
[53:41.440 --> 53:47.160]  Their big story was they could have indicted Donald Trump Jr. for using a password and
[53:47.160 --> 53:52.280]  looking up WikiLeaks, which is nonsensical because there's no crime there either.
[53:52.280 --> 53:54.120]  But that's the counter narrative.
[53:54.120 --> 53:57.040]  They're very good at the counter narrative.
[53:57.040 --> 54:00.080]  They are just as busted as can be.
[54:00.080 --> 54:04.160]  And it had this been known at the time, Obama would have been impeached.
[54:04.160 --> 54:05.640]  Let's be very clear.
[54:05.640 --> 54:08.480]  They spied on candidate Donald Trump.
[54:08.480 --> 54:11.700]  They spied on president Donald Trump.
[54:11.700 --> 54:18.040]  This is an abuse of power, again, that makes Watergate look like small potatoes.
[54:18.040 --> 54:24.960]  And it is now watch in the 24 hour news cycle, particularly on Super Bowl Sunday.
[54:24.960 --> 54:28.360]  They will do everything possible to bury this.
[54:28.360 --> 54:32.480]  Thank God that there's an info wars because we won't let it be buried.
[54:32.480 --> 54:36.480]  Totally, Roger, and of course, tied to this notice on Friday, they come out with a story
[54:36.480 --> 54:40.360]  that vindicates you, but they spin it like, oh, look, there was a secret report.
[54:40.360 --> 54:45.240]  He and Don Jr., meaning you and Don Jr. almost got indicted for computer crimes.
[54:45.240 --> 54:48.080]  But then they didn't do it because there wasn't evidence of it.
[54:48.080 --> 54:49.080]  That's exculpatory.
[54:49.080 --> 54:51.840]  But the media spins it like, oh, look, here's the proof.
[54:51.840 --> 54:53.720]  What the hell are they trying there?
[54:53.720 --> 55:00.200]  Yeah, actually Buzzfeed, when this story first broke on November 3rd, 2020, the Department
[55:00.200 --> 55:06.640]  of Justice actually put out a press release at midnight on election day, the busiest media
[55:06.640 --> 55:11.080]  day of the year, and even they admitted that I was vindicated.
[55:11.080 --> 55:15.720]  Again, I had no connection to the Russian hacking if it even took place.
[55:15.720 --> 55:21.840]  See, I wanted to prove at my trial with the use of forensic evidence and expert testimony
[55:21.840 --> 55:27.000]  that there was no online hack of the Democratic National Committee, not by the Russians or
[55:27.000 --> 55:32.480]  anyone else, that the information stolen had been downloaded to some kind of a portable
[55:32.480 --> 55:33.480]  drive.
[55:33.480 --> 55:38.040]  All of the experts, such as Bill Binney, were prepared to testify to that extent, but the
[55:38.040 --> 55:39.880]  judge would not allow it.
[55:39.880 --> 55:42.880]  Their entire narrative has now just blown up.
[55:42.880 --> 55:49.760]  The only people that were spying, the only people that were engaged in cyber crimes were
[55:49.760 --> 55:51.440]  Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.
[55:51.440 --> 55:58.840]  So we now know Hillary Clinton and her lawyers paid for the dirty dossier, the phony dossier.
[55:58.840 --> 56:05.040]  We now know that the crowd strikes report that alleged that the Democratic National
[56:05.040 --> 56:09.480]  Committee was hacked by Russian intelligence, and that information was somehow given to
[56:09.480 --> 56:11.160]  the Trump administration.
[56:11.160 --> 56:16.800]  That was proven in the declassified documents unearthed by Rick Rennell when he was the
[56:16.800 --> 56:19.480]  acting director of national intelligence.
[56:19.480 --> 56:22.360]  So their entire narrative has fallen apart.
[56:22.360 --> 56:23.760]  Well, Roger, let me ask you this.
[56:23.760 --> 56:24.760]  You've got to go.
[56:24.760 --> 56:28.240]  You'll be back with us tomorrow for a full hour.
[56:28.240 --> 56:29.240]  What happens next?
[56:29.240 --> 56:30.840]  I mean, does this say Durham's actually got teeth?
[56:30.840 --> 56:32.240]  Because this is a big deal.
[56:32.240 --> 56:35.280]  I don't see how they put the genie back in the bottle.
[56:35.280 --> 56:37.480]  Well, Durham has the bully pulpit.
[56:37.480 --> 56:40.040]  I remember he does work for Merrick Garland.
[56:40.040 --> 56:45.280]  He would have to have the approval of the Attorney General to bring any indictment.
[56:45.280 --> 56:48.240]  But it is very clear that he is hot on their trail.
[56:48.240 --> 56:54.720]  It is very clear that he is loading more and more of the criminal conspiracies of the Clinton
[56:54.720 --> 56:55.720]  campaign.
[56:55.720 --> 56:58.840]  He has a terrific reputation for integrity.
[56:58.840 --> 56:59.840]  We shall see.
[56:59.840 --> 57:00.840]  We shall see.
[57:00.840 --> 57:03.960]  Roger, how do people find you?
[57:03.960 --> 57:07.680]  You have great t-shirts, great books, great information, and it's stuff the left doesn't
[57:07.680 --> 57:08.680]  want people to have.
[57:08.680 --> 57:10.720]  We need to keep you fighting.
[57:10.720 --> 57:12.600]  How do folks support the great worker, Roger Stone?
[57:12.600 --> 57:20.640]  Well, I still am fighting six ongoing harassment legal suits against me, all frivolous, all
[57:20.640 --> 57:21.640]  defamatory.
[57:21.640 --> 57:25.640]  Go to StoneDefenseFund.com, StoneDefenseFund.com.
[57:25.640 --> 57:30.160]  I'm ready to keep fighting, and now, Alex, I'm looking at whether I can sue.
[57:30.160 --> 57:32.880]  I need to get back some of what they took from me and my wife.
[57:32.880 --> 57:33.880]  Oh, absolutely.
[57:33.880 --> 57:34.880]  Me too.
[57:34.880 --> 57:35.880]  All right.
[57:35.880 --> 57:36.880]  God bless you, Roger Stone.
[57:36.880 --> 57:37.880]  Great job.
[57:37.880 --> 57:38.880]  Let's see.
[57:38.880 --> 57:39.880]  All right.
[57:39.880 --> 57:40.880]  Big second hour.
[57:40.880 --> 57:41.880]  Totally loaded with critical info.
[57:41.880 --> 57:42.880]  That's all we have.
[57:42.880 --> 57:43.880]  It's coming up.
[57:43.880 --> 57:44.880]  Have you shared Info Wars link today?
[57:44.880 --> 57:45.880]  You're how we defeat the New World Order.
[57:45.880 --> 57:46.880]  Stay with us.
[57:46.880 --> 57:52.040]  Two-in-run contact tracers aren't coming.
[57:52.040 --> 57:57.200]  They're here all over the world, from Australia to the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[57:57.200 --> 58:00.680]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go, and then coming to your
[58:00.680 --> 58:06.400]  house and threatening, in some cases, actually taking people away into the night to their
[58:06.400 --> 58:07.400]  facilities.
[58:07.400 --> 58:12.000]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process, where they come and
[58:12.000 --> 58:16.160]  take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[58:16.160 --> 58:17.960]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[58:17.960 --> 58:22.200]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high-quality Faraday cages, many
[58:22.200 --> 58:26.480]  of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military
[58:26.480 --> 58:29.080]  grade at InfoWarsStore.com.

[58:33.960 --> 58:39.440]  Again, we have big backpacks, we have special dry bags, we've got them for cell phones,
[58:39.440 --> 58:42.080]  we've got them for laptops, we've got them for iPads.

[58:50.440 --> 58:55.840]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[58:55.840 --> 58:57.320]  a healthier life.
[58:57.320 --> 59:01.720]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you're getting enough in your system with a supplement
[59:01.720 --> 59:03.340]  that contains both.
[59:03.340 --> 59:08.320]  This InfoWars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase
[59:08.320 --> 59:09.920]  from the InfoWarsStore.
[59:09.920 --> 59:14.760]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[59:14.760 --> 59:17.440]  contain the rose plant seeds.
[59:17.440 --> 59:22.640]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[59:22.640 --> 59:27.000]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[59:27.000 --> 59:28.000]  shown.
[59:28.000 --> 59:32.480]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role
[59:32.480 --> 59:36.840]  in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[59:36.840 --> 59:41.960]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations
[59:41.960 --> 59:42.960]  like here in America.
[59:42.960 --> 59:47.800]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InfoWarsStore.com where we promise
[59:47.800 --> 59:51.880]  our rose hips don't lie.
[59:51.880 --> 1:00:13.360]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:13.360 --> 1:00:18.360]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:18.360 --> 1:00:23.000]  All right, folks, while we're busy, we'll look at the Durham investigation and the
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:27.280]  illegal spying on Trump that we told you was going on, because what's happening to us five
[1:00:27.280 --> 1:00:30.440]  years ago, four years ago, that's big.
[1:00:30.440 --> 1:00:32.920]  The fies are coming out and just hiding in plain view.
[1:00:32.920 --> 1:00:35.360]  Oh, yeah, we get synthetic viruses in the lab.
[1:00:35.360 --> 1:00:36.360]  We made COVID-19.
[1:00:36.360 --> 1:00:37.720]  We made our own version of it.
[1:00:37.720 --> 1:00:38.720]  Totally illegal.
[1:00:38.720 --> 1:00:39.720]  They just admit it.
[1:00:39.720 --> 1:00:46.480]  To just this that I didn't get to, in reversal, FDA puts breaks of its shots for kids.
[1:00:46.480 --> 1:00:50.000]  The whole house of cards is coming down, and that's only the tip of the iceberg.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  This is mind-blowing.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:58.320]  Bill comes out and says, Trudeau is acting and sounding like Hitler.
[1:00:58.320 --> 1:00:59.920]  This isn't a liberal conservative thing, folks.
[1:00:59.920 --> 1:01:01.520]  It's a self-preservation thing.
[1:01:01.520 --> 1:01:04.440]  When people finally get, do I really want to live in a surveillance state?
[1:01:04.440 --> 1:01:07.440]  Do I really want big pharma people to put in my body, whatever they want?
[1:01:07.440 --> 1:01:12.720]  Do I really want Google and Facebook and Twitter and LinkedIn and all of them to ban being able
[1:01:12.720 --> 1:01:19.920]  to go visit mainline medical sites that talk about vitamin C and vitamin D helping you?
[1:01:19.920 --> 1:01:21.000]  They want you hopeless.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:25.920]  They want you under their control as the Facebook documents that came out years ago showed.
[1:01:25.920 --> 1:01:32.000]  Hopeless and alone, so they could exploit you, but you exploit people and it blows back
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  on you.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.200]  You don't want to build a world like that.
[1:01:35.200 --> 1:01:36.200]  So crazy.
[1:01:36.200 --> 1:01:38.640]  So I'll be back tomorrow, Lord willing, 11 a.m.
[1:01:38.640 --> 1:01:39.800]  I wasn't going to be here today.
[1:01:39.800 --> 1:01:42.760]  I was excited, Jason Bergman was going to host the first two hours, Owen takes over
[1:01:42.760 --> 1:01:45.440]  Sunday Live, but this was so big.
[1:01:45.440 --> 1:01:50.480]  All this coming out, I had to be here, but while we're busy watching all this, the Russians
[1:01:50.480 --> 1:01:55.000]  evacuating their embassy is the biggest deal and then NATO's pouring troops in, pouring
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  weapons in.
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:00.200]  I'm not saying the Russians are perfect either, but our media doesn't talk about how the Russians
[1:02:00.200 --> 1:02:02.320]  say stop pouring troops onto our border.
[1:02:02.320 --> 1:02:05.920]  So they put more troops on their border and then the West goes, oh my God, you're about
[1:02:05.920 --> 1:02:06.920]  to attack us.
[1:02:06.920 --> 1:02:11.840]  Last time I checked, Russia's not attacking anybody except al-Qaeda and worked with their
[1:02:11.840 --> 1:02:17.320]  own military to get rid of them in Syria, something good that happened that Trump did
[1:02:17.320 --> 1:02:18.320]  and that Russia did.
[1:02:18.320 --> 1:02:20.640]  So this is just crazy.
[1:02:20.640 --> 1:02:25.160]  And them saying that Russia's going to stage a false flag, the globalists have a lot bigger
[1:02:25.160 --> 1:02:26.160]  history of doing that.
[1:02:26.160 --> 1:02:31.760]  I'm saying anything's possible, but we're on the eve of a major escalation from a proxy
[1:02:31.760 --> 1:02:41.720]  war, NA, what do they call it, they've got a term for it here, where they call it a hybrid
[1:02:41.720 --> 1:02:42.720]  war.
[1:02:42.720 --> 1:02:44.560]  Well, what do you think a proxy war is?
[1:02:44.560 --> 1:02:51.360]  Of course, a hybrid war's been going since before 2014 because the Ukrainian government
[1:02:51.360 --> 1:02:55.600]  started trying to take the Russian-held areas that Russians had for a thousand years.
[1:02:55.600 --> 1:02:57.800]  So all of this is very, very serious.
[1:02:57.800 --> 1:02:59.800]  Separately, I've got to make a correction.
[1:02:59.800 --> 1:03:02.880]  When I get stuff wrong, I make a correction, and I didn't really get it super wrong.
[1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:07.560]  I just went off the news yesterday during the Saturday show, hadn't talked to Joe, and
[1:03:07.560 --> 1:03:14.120]  it said, oh, he's not speaking at UFC, not doing the commentating at UFC 271 because
[1:03:14.120 --> 1:03:16.840]  Disney controls it and didn't let him.
[1:03:16.840 --> 1:03:19.280]  Dana White came out and Joe's also said that it's pure bull.
[1:03:19.280 --> 1:03:22.600]  He's just busy taking care of stuff in his comedy shows, his podcasts.
[1:03:22.600 --> 1:03:24.720]  He decided not to go host that.
[1:03:24.720 --> 1:03:26.560]  They didn't have him host every one of them he wanted to.
[1:03:26.560 --> 1:03:28.040]  He's a busy guy.
[1:03:28.040 --> 1:03:30.680]  And so Joe decided not to host that.
[1:03:30.680 --> 1:03:34.640]  And we had reported what the national news had said, and so we got something wrong by
[1:03:34.640 --> 1:03:37.880]  going off the national news as a source.
[1:03:37.880 --> 1:03:43.640]  So the good news is he was not canceled off of the UFC.
[1:03:43.640 --> 1:03:47.080]  So that is some positive news on that front.
[1:03:47.080 --> 1:03:49.440]  And then we're going to cover this tomorrow.
[1:03:49.440 --> 1:03:51.160]  I mean, there's so much news here.
[1:03:51.160 --> 1:03:56.800]  World Economic Forum insane pro-CRT propaganda draws sharp rebuke.
[1:03:56.800 --> 1:04:01.160]  Who do you think's running all the CRT crap that America and Europe's evil and racist
[1:04:01.160 --> 1:04:02.800]  and white people are bad?
[1:04:02.800 --> 1:04:06.800]  The Debo's group and the Communist Chinese, because they're undermining former Western
[1:04:06.800 --> 1:04:13.320]  free countries because our free systems challenge their authoritarian systems and make them
[1:04:13.320 --> 1:04:14.320]  look bad.
[1:04:14.320 --> 1:04:19.040]  And the globalists are wrapping their agenda in blackface saying, except our new world order,
[1:04:19.040 --> 1:04:23.800]  except our open borders, except our carbon taxes, except our universal basic incomes
[1:04:23.800 --> 1:04:27.640]  are your racist and people have to reject this and see through it.
[1:04:27.640 --> 1:04:34.640]  The corporate media ally with the big banks is using race as their cover and it's disgusting.
[1:04:34.640 --> 1:04:40.680]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today, tomorrow marks the day of the end of 25% off on storeable
[1:04:40.680 --> 1:04:46.920]  food ready to ship to you right now at infowarstore.com and prepare with Alex.com and X3, the incredible
[1:04:46.920 --> 1:04:50.480]  deep earth tri iodine is back in stock 50% off.
[1:04:50.480 --> 1:04:58.480]  Jason Burmans takes it over, stay with us.
[1:04:58.480 --> 1:05:04.000]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:09.720]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[1:05:09.720 --> 1:05:13.920]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[1:05:13.920 --> 1:05:19.040]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population
[1:05:19.040 --> 1:05:23.880]  hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[1:05:23.880 --> 1:05:28.320]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's
[1:05:28.320 --> 1:05:33.200]  unbelievably unsettling to see, but there is only two things to do.
[1:05:33.200 --> 1:05:36.320]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[1:05:36.320 --> 1:05:39.680]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[1:05:39.680 --> 1:05:44.320]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to
[1:05:44.320 --> 1:05:45.320]  an end.
[1:05:45.320 --> 1:05:51.120]  So we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival
[1:05:51.120 --> 1:05:57.600]  gear, seeds, shortwave radios and life saving knowledge at infoorstore.com.
[1:05:57.600 --> 1:06:20.640]  Hey everybody, Jason Bomas here, and I am so happy to be with you guys on this Super
[1:06:20.640 --> 1:06:30.200]  Bowl Sunday, the bread and circus day that America treats like a religious experience,
[1:06:30.200 --> 1:06:35.680]  and hopefully you're buckled in for some hardcore information.
[1:06:35.680 --> 1:06:39.840]  Because what we're going to be talking about today is actually going to be a microcosm
[1:06:39.840 --> 1:06:47.520]  for what you're seeing with the gaslighting and the lying and the no, no of Leslie to
[1:06:47.520 --> 1:06:48.520]  Donald Trump.
[1:06:48.520 --> 1:06:54.840]  We played that clip probably about 20 plus times on my program, it became a running joke.
[1:06:54.840 --> 1:06:59.480]  Because the information that Alex just went over, although it has now been thoroughly
[1:06:59.480 --> 1:07:03.240]  vindicated, was out there and obvious.
[1:07:03.240 --> 1:07:06.840]  And again, she was just saying no to reality.
[1:07:06.840 --> 1:07:13.520]  And we've seen that on a massive level over the last two years.
[1:07:13.520 --> 1:07:21.160]  But what we're going to be focusing on is actually a story that I started doing probably
[1:07:21.160 --> 1:07:27.760]  about three years ago, a little bit over three years ago that still has not made its way
[1:07:27.760 --> 1:07:30.520]  into the mainstream.
[1:07:30.520 --> 1:07:35.640]  And it's actually going to kind of coincide with Joe Rogan and Disney.
[1:07:35.640 --> 1:07:41.520]  And although I'm very happy to hear that, for instance, Joe Rogan was not canceled by
[1:07:41.520 --> 1:07:42.520]  Disney.
[1:07:42.520 --> 1:07:46.200]  And I just want to point out because I am an MMA fan and I was looking forward to Rogan.
[1:07:46.200 --> 1:07:47.840]  I did follow this.
[1:07:47.840 --> 1:07:54.840]  And even last night at the presser, Dana White actually said, uh-uh, bullshiz on the
[1:07:54.840 --> 1:07:56.760]  scheduling conflict.
[1:07:56.760 --> 1:07:59.800]  So you know, to be told.
[1:07:59.800 --> 1:08:03.080]  But let me say this about Disney, okay?
[1:08:03.080 --> 1:08:04.960]  The magical mouse himself.
[1:08:04.960 --> 1:08:05.960]  There he is, huh?
[1:08:05.960 --> 1:08:06.960]  When you wish upon a star.
[1:08:06.960 --> 1:08:09.520]  Kind of wonder what that star is these days.
[1:08:09.520 --> 1:08:11.400]  I mean, what kind of star are we talking about?
[1:08:11.400 --> 1:08:13.640]  Mickey, a pinnacle, a pentagram, I don't know.
[1:08:13.640 --> 1:08:15.400]  I don't know.
[1:08:15.400 --> 1:08:25.520]  But they sure seem to be at the forefront of inverting reality via mainstream media that
[1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:28.760]  goes well beyond cartoons at this point.
[1:08:28.760 --> 1:08:35.560]  And a plethora of people have done video after video after video of the trauma many Disney
[1:08:35.560 --> 1:08:43.080]  kids have taken after the fact, becoming big stars, a Britney Spears, right?
[1:08:43.080 --> 1:08:48.920]  Meanwhile, having these really traumatic events happening to them, but that's again, just
[1:08:48.920 --> 1:08:51.880]  a microcosm for what we're going to talk about.
[1:08:51.880 --> 1:08:54.520]  Disney is also a Leviathan, all right?
[1:08:54.520 --> 1:09:00.720]  It owns so many properties now, such as the Star Wars property, beloved as a child, the
[1:09:00.720 --> 1:09:07.440]  Simpsons property, beloved as a child, that's gotten more and more and more what, censored,
[1:09:07.440 --> 1:09:11.000]  edited, and bending the knee to the mob.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:15.320]  They took a poo off that program.
[1:09:15.320 --> 1:09:22.000]  Now as somebody who watches that show and loves that show, I don't understand the negative
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:29.960]  impact of a man who owned his own business, was one of the more three dimensional characters
[1:09:29.960 --> 1:09:36.040]  out of the gates, was a good friend to Homer, helped enlighten his life, got married, had
[1:09:36.040 --> 1:09:38.360]  a bunch of children, took care of them.
[1:09:38.360 --> 1:09:40.840]  I mean, bad, we can't have that.
[1:09:40.840 --> 1:09:41.840]  That's real diversity.
[1:09:41.840 --> 1:09:44.440]  Nope, we're going to cancel that.
[1:09:44.440 --> 1:09:46.880]  And that's the whole thing.
[1:09:46.880 --> 1:09:49.740]  Disney is not about family entertainment.
[1:09:49.740 --> 1:09:56.640]  It's about money, money, money, control, control, control, and a narrative pushed.
[1:09:56.640 --> 1:10:06.600]  And now with Disney and ESPN and others out there kind of acting as this pseudo-techno-fascist
[1:10:06.600 --> 1:10:13.040]  arm of censorship, you're seeing it with Twitter and Google, you saw it with Roseanne
[1:10:13.040 --> 1:10:14.040]  Barr, for instance.
[1:10:14.040 --> 1:10:18.840]  It's not about how much money entertainment can make, okay?
[1:10:18.840 --> 1:10:21.000]  No, no, no.
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:23.480]  It's about the narrative at the end and bending the knee.
[1:10:23.480 --> 1:10:30.440]  So sometimes you decide what you're going to actually be outraged about.
[1:10:30.440 --> 1:10:34.480]  It's called manufactured outrage selective enforcement.
[1:10:34.480 --> 1:10:40.520]  And the very truth of the matter is that Disney also owns another property, okay?
[1:10:40.520 --> 1:10:45.560]  And that property happens to be ESPN, that's why we're talking about it, okay?
[1:10:45.560 --> 1:10:55.920]  ESPN and Disney have done their best to manage information about a guy named Connor McGregor.
[1:10:55.920 --> 1:11:05.400]  So much so that three years ago, this is McGregor being presented as a family man, okay?
[1:11:05.400 --> 1:11:11.640]  Oh, he's a family man with his young son at the Super Bowl, hmm?
[1:11:11.640 --> 1:11:17.760]  And when this happened, I was very upset, I did a whole video about it.
[1:11:17.760 --> 1:11:23.560]  And the reason I did a video about it is what I'm going to present to you through this video
[1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:25.480]  is disturbing information.
[1:11:25.480 --> 1:11:28.200]  It's stuff I'd rather not go over.
[1:11:28.200 --> 1:11:30.880]  I'm a huge fan of MMA.
[1:11:30.880 --> 1:11:37.200]  In fact, I actually call pro fights not only with people like Jens Pulver, who are pioneers
[1:11:37.200 --> 1:11:38.680]  of the sport, okay?
[1:11:38.680 --> 1:11:42.880]  But Pat Militich, UFC Hall of Famer and UFC Hall of Fame coach.
[1:11:42.880 --> 1:11:46.600]  By the way, I'm going to be calling three of those fights coming up in March live.
[1:11:46.600 --> 1:11:50.280]  You can get the pay-per-view, but I encourage you to come to the Quad Cities, Iowa and check
[1:11:50.280 --> 1:11:51.680]  them out in person.
[1:11:51.680 --> 1:11:53.880]  That's how much I love the sport, okay?
[1:11:53.880 --> 1:12:01.880]  But the fact of the matter is that they have been covering up information that is publicly
[1:12:01.880 --> 1:12:07.320]  available that suggests I'm going to be very careful about everything I show and read to
[1:12:07.320 --> 1:12:09.960]  you today, okay?
[1:12:09.960 --> 1:12:18.160]  That Conor McGregor is a violent, brutal, serial rapist.
[1:12:18.160 --> 1:12:25.520]  And right now, he still has at least one case in civil court that in my opinion, when you
[1:12:25.520 --> 1:12:32.040]  see the evidence that I am going to present to you, should have absolutely been tried
[1:12:32.040 --> 1:12:33.840]  in a criminal court.
[1:12:33.840 --> 1:12:40.320]  And then you say to me, well, Jason, why wasn't it tried in a criminal court?
[1:12:40.320 --> 1:12:47.320]  Well, as the media in Ireland, number one, was not even allowed to name McGregor as a
[1:12:47.320 --> 1:12:53.040]  suspect, and they had to constantly refer to him as an Irish sports star.
[1:12:53.040 --> 1:12:59.240]  In fact, this news actually came out via the New York Times many, many months after I was
[1:12:59.240 --> 1:13:05.080]  reporting on it, and the details of which were hidden from the public.
[1:13:05.080 --> 1:13:11.800]  When you read this article, shock stats, okay, shock stats, in Ireland, I want people to
[1:13:11.800 --> 1:13:22.880]  perceive this, only 8% of reported rates result in convictions, figures reveal.
[1:13:22.880 --> 1:13:24.480]  That's a wow.
[1:13:24.480 --> 1:13:25.480]  That's a wow.
[1:13:25.480 --> 1:13:34.240]  We're going to go deep on this one incident that occurred allegedly in December of 2018,
[1:13:34.240 --> 1:13:40.120]  but that's not even where we're going to start, because when I said serial, I meant it.
[1:13:40.120 --> 1:13:47.240]  There are so many other allegations and even arrests, which did not result in convictions
[1:13:47.240 --> 1:13:49.520]  of this type of behavior.
[1:13:49.520 --> 1:13:58.320]  I want you to right now look to your mother, your wife, your sister, your nieces, your daughter,
[1:13:58.320 --> 1:14:07.640]  and ask yourself, if in fact this is true, and he is being promoted by Disney of all
[1:14:07.640 --> 1:14:11.600]  people, why is it not in the public arena?
[1:14:11.600 --> 1:14:13.080]  Why don't you know about it?
[1:14:13.080 --> 1:14:23.080]  Why is he in Reebok commercials as a toy for children in a playroom being promoted
[1:14:23.080 --> 1:14:25.080]  as a family man?
[1:14:25.080 --> 1:14:30.520]  Well, folks, it is because, again, we live in an inverted reality, and the fact of the
[1:14:30.520 --> 1:14:34.240]  matter is, Disney does like profits.
[1:14:34.240 --> 1:14:36.680]  They're not really concerned about morality.
[1:14:36.680 --> 1:14:41.160]  Again, we talked about all those childhood stars, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:14:41.160 --> 1:14:47.760]  Connor McGregor, who is not even a winner at this point, is the biggest financial draw
[1:14:47.760 --> 1:14:49.160]  they have.
[1:14:49.160 --> 1:14:58.400]  What Connor McGregor gets reported that he actually earns is a fraction of what Disney
[1:14:58.400 --> 1:15:08.720]  is actually earning on the back of that persona, that image, that Bernaysian prop up, the notorious,
[1:15:08.720 --> 1:15:11.840]  oh boy!
[1:15:11.840 --> 1:15:17.800]  So it's not about love, it's not about family, it's not about togetherness and life lessons.
[1:15:17.800 --> 1:15:20.960]  That's not what Disney is about, okay?
[1:15:20.960 --> 1:15:28.640]  It's about profits, control, narrative management, and so much more, and in this case, we are
[1:15:28.640 --> 1:15:34.000]  going to show you guys some not only disturbing evidence of what I've talked about, but a
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:39.880]  disturbing behavior from McGregor of doing these things over a long period of time.

[1:19:03.360 --> 1:19:08.640]  empowering, and fulfilling, it's going to be hard to attain.
[1:19:08.640 --> 1:19:11.360]  And when it comes to information, boy is that true.
[1:19:11.360 --> 1:19:18.880]  And we see the entire global corrupt into human depopulation, great reset combine, trying
[1:19:18.880 --> 1:19:25.520]  to collapse our society, to build on its ashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision, suppressing
[1:19:25.520 --> 1:19:32.000]  the voices of good people all around the world, and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:37.840]  that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria, their world's going to end in 2030,
[1:19:37.840 --> 1:19:40.760]  carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[1:19:40.760 --> 1:19:45.960]  And none of it can succeed, none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is
[1:19:45.960 --> 1:19:48.000]  silenced and gas lit.
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:52.040]  That's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence, and that's
[1:19:52.040 --> 1:19:55.920]  why it's hard to share M4 Wars links and band up video links.
[1:19:55.920 --> 1:19:58.880]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[1:19:58.880 --> 1:20:16.760]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:16.760 --> 1:20:22.600]  Hey everybody, Jason Vermus back here in the second hour of the Sunday show of Alex Jones
[1:20:22.600 --> 1:20:26.240]  and Alex was on fire today, folks.
[1:20:26.240 --> 1:20:35.720]  I was so happy to see him play that clip of media lying to you and straight face lying.
[1:20:35.720 --> 1:20:43.520]  This story is again showing you how the media is controlled not only on a national level
[1:20:43.520 --> 1:20:51.120]  when you're talking about the deep state and elections, but on a corporate level as well.
[1:20:51.120 --> 1:20:59.600]  These are narratives that empower people to again control our lives on a mass level and
[1:20:59.600 --> 1:21:05.080]  some of that is through entertainment and of course sports today is the day to focus
[1:21:05.080 --> 1:21:06.080]  on that.
[1:21:06.080 --> 1:21:07.800]  So where do we leave off?
[1:21:07.800 --> 1:21:16.080]  We looked at this statistic that in Ireland, only 8% of reported rapes result in convictions.
[1:21:16.080 --> 1:21:23.800]  Now number one, we already know through numerous studies that women who are sexually assaulted
[1:21:23.800 --> 1:21:29.000]  a lot of the time, in fact, in a majority of cases don't even report it out of shame.
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:36.280]  And then you're going to tell me that you're going to get less than one and 10 in convictions.
[1:21:36.280 --> 1:21:41.080]  I mean, in Ireland it said, so if you had one of the members of a parliament, again
[1:21:41.080 --> 1:21:48.360]  without having to name the gentleman, referring to him as an Irish sports star, going around,
[1:21:48.360 --> 1:21:51.840]  let's just say assaulting with impunity.
[1:21:51.840 --> 1:22:01.000]  And before again, we even get to the 2018 incident that is repugnant and beyond reproach.
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:05.200]  Okay, I want to show you and make sure that you understand this woman wasn't in it for
[1:22:05.200 --> 1:22:06.440]  the money.
[1:22:06.440 --> 1:22:12.640]  She was a family friend by many of the media accounts and she was offered over a million
[1:22:12.640 --> 1:22:19.520]  plus, but rejected it in hopes of getting the criminal trial, which she already knew
[1:22:19.520 --> 1:22:24.440]  had about an 8% chance of success.
[1:22:24.440 --> 1:22:26.840]  Just let that sink in for a moment.
[1:22:26.840 --> 1:22:31.640]  So let's move on to some of the other things that McGregor was arrested for and got off
[1:22:31.640 --> 1:22:32.640]  for.
[1:22:32.640 --> 1:22:34.280]  Okay, let's start here.
[1:22:34.280 --> 1:22:43.240]  He did not get charged in 2020 over allegedly cornering a woman who was married in a bathroom
[1:22:43.240 --> 1:22:50.040]  while he was in town in France, Corsica, for some kind of a charity event.
[1:22:50.040 --> 1:22:53.560]  I think it was the Princess of Monaco was running that.
[1:22:53.560 --> 1:23:00.200]  So he was in a bar and he took his security allegedly, cornered a woman, decided he was
[1:23:00.200 --> 1:23:09.200]  going to whip out his Johnny Mandangle and basically say, here you go, arrested for that,
[1:23:09.200 --> 1:23:10.200]  not charged.
[1:23:10.200 --> 1:23:12.720]  Okay, that's a 2020 incident.
[1:23:12.720 --> 1:23:19.360]  Okay, McGregor and his entourage accused of forcing a nightclub bottle service into
[1:23:19.360 --> 1:23:20.360]  a car.
[1:23:20.360 --> 1:23:22.960]  Okay, and they say his entourage, no, he was with them.
[1:23:22.960 --> 1:23:24.600]  You read the article.
[1:23:24.600 --> 1:23:32.160]  Now Charlie Ward claims he just made out with the girl consensually, but this was an incident
[1:23:32.160 --> 1:23:38.360]  I believe in 2016, perhaps 17, maybe 2017.
[1:23:38.360 --> 1:23:43.000]  This was one in California, there it is, December of 2016, California.
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:46.280]  Okay, we've got a couple incidents here.
[1:23:46.280 --> 1:23:49.680]  Let's continue.
[1:23:49.680 --> 1:23:55.720]  So this happened about I believe six months, actually a little bit longer because it was
[1:23:55.720 --> 1:24:02.280]  October, so almost 10 months after the 2018 incident where he was alleged to, where they
[1:24:02.280 --> 1:24:09.480]  investigated him for dragging a woman into a car outside of a bar and forcing, we'll
[1:24:09.480 --> 1:24:10.480]  just say oral.
[1:24:10.480 --> 1:24:17.160]  Okay, again, not a serial waiver, wait till you see the evidence for the 2018 incident
[1:24:17.160 --> 1:24:20.200]  and how it's been managed because that's where we're going to go.
[1:24:20.200 --> 1:24:25.320]  So right now pinned at Jason Burmus, if you want to follow me on Twitter, there's a video
[1:24:25.320 --> 1:24:31.000]  on top, but instead of the video, we're going to go article by article to understand I had
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:36.160]  nothing to do with this reporting, but at the end of the day, when you look at the evidence,
[1:24:36.160 --> 1:24:42.040]  not only does it contain all of these articles and media reports, but actually leaked WhatsApp
[1:24:42.040 --> 1:24:48.000]  messages between journalists behind the scenes that had access to police sources.
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:55.720]  Okay, so this first one right here, okay, it is, uh, Iris Central, woman too afraid to
[1:24:55.720 --> 1:25:00.840]  give statement on alleged, you know what, by Irish sports star.
[1:25:00.840 --> 1:25:06.200]  Okay, now I want you to think about this for a moment.
[1:25:06.200 --> 1:25:11.640]  Later on, when we read these messages, this person actually showed up according to these
[1:25:11.640 --> 1:25:18.680]  reporters to the police station with his lawyers saying it was consensual then, but she was
[1:25:18.680 --> 1:25:24.400]  so scared as we're going to show you for weeks on end after it happened because it was so
[1:25:24.400 --> 1:25:27.320]  brutal that she didn't name him.
[1:25:27.320 --> 1:25:31.080]  Again, does this sound like somebody who was in it for a payday?
[1:25:31.080 --> 1:25:35.440]  You read what it said, the quote is, at the end of the day, there is no doubt that this
[1:25:35.440 --> 1:25:42.440]  young lady suffered a horrendous ordeal, the examinations and all of the evidence, all
[1:25:42.440 --> 1:25:48.000]  of it, which is going to include eyewitness accounts of the evening, CCTV camera footage
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:51.120]  and people actually being in the room as it began to take place.
[1:25:51.120 --> 1:25:59.240]  Okay, and forensics, okay, all of the evidence shows that she was raped and very badly assaulted
[1:25:59.240 --> 1:26:01.320]  in that penthouse suite.
[1:26:01.320 --> 1:26:05.320]  Again, I don't write for these media organizations.
[1:26:05.320 --> 1:26:07.120]  Number two, let's go down.
[1:26:07.120 --> 1:26:08.520]  She was a mother.
[1:26:08.520 --> 1:26:11.280]  Again, she was a mom.
[1:26:11.280 --> 1:26:17.840]  I want people to have this thinking, this is a person that they parade around as a hero,
[1:26:17.840 --> 1:26:22.440]  that they promote, that has his own brand of whiskey.
[1:26:22.440 --> 1:26:27.240]  His whiskey brand is worth billions at this point.
[1:26:27.240 --> 1:26:33.280]  It really turns my stomach and I hope after this broadcast, you other info warriors are
[1:26:33.280 --> 1:26:38.240]  going to go check this out and understand that I didn't make any of this off.
[1:26:38.240 --> 1:26:41.160]  I don't have anything to gain.
[1:26:41.160 --> 1:26:47.840]  Again, it's a microcosm of how if this were to come out on a mass level, they would manage
[1:26:47.840 --> 1:26:50.200]  it and they have managed it in the past.
[1:26:50.200 --> 1:26:54.280]  When it started to come out in the United States, they had pre-taped interviews, they
[1:26:54.280 --> 1:26:59.200]  shut down reporters at press conferences, they managed the information.
[1:26:59.200 --> 1:27:06.880]  You see the same kind of playbook, what, with the war on terror, the Iraq war, Syria, COVID-19,
[1:27:06.880 --> 1:27:10.440]  1984, the list goes on.
[1:27:10.440 --> 1:27:18.440]  This article here, here's the headline, right, mom who accused Irish sports star of rape
[1:27:18.440 --> 1:27:24.160]  was found battered and bruised and also had bloody clothing, of course.
[1:27:24.160 --> 1:27:29.080]  When you go through these things, it gives you the down and everybody's at a bar and
[1:27:29.080 --> 1:27:33.840]  there's cocaine involved and I certainly don't suggest going out and getting wasted
[1:27:33.840 --> 1:27:35.120]  and doing cocaine.
[1:27:35.120 --> 1:27:38.160]  Bad decisions are made, okay?
[1:27:38.160 --> 1:27:44.760]  Bad decisions are made, but this woman certainly from all the evidence I've seen did not think
[1:27:44.760 --> 1:27:50.560]  she was putting herself in a situation where she was going to be brutally beaten and sexually
[1:27:50.560 --> 1:27:56.760]  assaulted on a level that when we get to the actual WhatsApp messages between these journalists
[1:27:56.760 --> 1:27:59.360]  is very, very hard to stomach.
[1:27:59.360 --> 1:28:03.000]  Okay, so let's go down to one more article before the break.
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:07.040]  Woman allegedly raped by Irish sports star was choked during ordeal.
[1:28:07.040 --> 1:28:10.640]  There were clear marks of choking around the woman's neck shortly after the incident on
[1:28:10.640 --> 1:28:11.760]  Monday morning.
[1:28:11.760 --> 1:28:17.760]  The woman resisted and bit the man in question, actually had a bite mark, okay, again, again,
[1:28:17.760 --> 1:28:24.200]  somebody who allegedly showed up at the police station to turn himself in and say it was
[1:28:24.200 --> 1:28:27.680]  consensual at the time and they sent him on his way.
[1:28:27.680 --> 1:28:33.360]  We are going to get to all the other details of this incident, why it's being covered up,
[1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:40.400]  who's behind it, not just Disney, WME Entertainment, Endeavor, Ari Emanuel, Rom's brother, you
[1:28:40.400 --> 1:28:41.400]  bet.
[1:28:41.400 --> 1:28:47.760]  Now is the time to go to infowarstore.com, make those purchases, go check out COVID land
[1:28:47.760 --> 1:28:54.760]  2, the mass by Paul Wittenberger and so much more, support Alex Jones and infowarstore.com.
[1:29:47.760 --> 1:30:03.440]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[1:30:03.440 --> 1:30:05.480]  a healthier life.
[1:30:05.480 --> 1:30:08.680]  Info wars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with
[1:30:08.680 --> 1:30:10.960]  a supplement that contains both.
[1:30:10.960 --> 1:30:15.920]  This info wars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase
[1:30:15.920 --> 1:30:17.520]  from the info wars store.
[1:30:17.520 --> 1:30:22.360]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[1:30:22.360 --> 1:30:25.080]  contain the rose plant seeds.
[1:30:25.080 --> 1:30:29.880]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[1:30:29.880 --> 1:30:34.600]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[1:30:34.600 --> 1:30:35.600]  shown.
[1:30:35.600 --> 1:30:39.880]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important
[1:30:39.880 --> 1:30:44.480]  role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[1:30:44.480 --> 1:30:49.560]  But it has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations
[1:30:49.560 --> 1:30:50.560]  like here in America.
[1:30:50.560 --> 1:30:55.600]  So next time you visit be sure to check it out at infowarstore.com where we promise our
[1:30:55.600 --> 1:30:57.520]  rose hips don't lie.

[1:31:02.440 --> 1:31:07.680]  lockdown, with the next phase of the great reset being a stage cyber attack, with the
[1:31:07.680 --> 1:31:14.120]  deep state pushing a civil war not just here but in Europe and war with Russia.
[1:31:14.120 --> 1:31:19.000]  With the massive inflation and all the other garbage that's taking place like supply chain

[1:32:58.320 --> 1:33:15.560]  Reading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:15.560 --> 1:33:21.920]  We are back at the Alex Jones show, I am sitting in for the second hour and before we get to
[1:33:21.920 --> 1:33:29.720]  more of the very hard to read and listen to information about the evidence pertaining
[1:33:29.720 --> 1:33:38.120]  to again, Connor McGregor, somebody who is celebrated in this infotainment celebrity
[1:33:38.120 --> 1:33:48.760]  obsessed culture is indeed a violent, violent person who what sexually assaults women and
[1:33:48.760 --> 1:33:54.920]  when I say that I'm not saying it in a light manner, a lot of people ask me, Jason, how
[1:33:54.920 --> 1:34:01.720]  is it that we live in a world where somebody like Dennis Hasser, who allegedly was raping
[1:34:01.720 --> 1:34:09.480]  young boys when he was a gym teacher and wrestling coach, we're talking about kids who were ten
[1:34:09.480 --> 1:34:15.520]  years old in the fourth grade, according to some of the court documents, how is it that
[1:34:15.520 --> 1:34:21.480]  guy not only never goes to jail for that, even though he was labeled by a judge, a serial
[1:34:21.480 --> 1:34:28.840]  child molester, but goes all the way up to the Senate and is the majority leader.
[1:34:28.840 --> 1:34:35.800]  And I say to them, it's because evil does have a very real power, okay?
[1:34:35.800 --> 1:34:42.000]  And those that embrace that evil, I mean, Star Wars is an allegory, kills me that Disney
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:50.080]  owns it for, for how much power you can actually have when you are that sociopathic and empowered
[1:34:50.080 --> 1:34:51.080]  by darkness.
[1:34:51.080 --> 1:34:57.120]  All right, that is about as dark as it gets Dennis Hasser, by the way, not in jail.
[1:34:57.120 --> 1:35:04.400]  And another reason is because we've kind of accepted these things in society and we have
[1:35:04.400 --> 1:35:10.920]  refused to demand justice for so long, it's not just America, again, you just saw the
[1:35:10.920 --> 1:35:13.800]  numbers in Ireland, 8% conviction rate.
[1:35:13.800 --> 1:35:20.480]  Again, what if that was your mother or your sister or your wife, God forbid, or your daughter?
[1:35:20.480 --> 1:35:22.840]  I got two little girls upstairs.
[1:35:22.840 --> 1:35:28.000]  I can't imagine, I mean, I don't know how I'd be able to control myself and maintain
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:31.760]  myself if something like that were to happen to them.
[1:35:31.760 --> 1:35:35.800]  And instead, I see the guy's trending right now on Twitter, I don't know why, I would
[1:35:35.800 --> 1:35:41.160]  assume it's some kind of a Super Bowl, either commercial or he's there or something that's
[1:35:41.160 --> 1:35:48.680]  totally and completely divested from reality or things that matter, okay?
[1:35:48.680 --> 1:35:53.040]  So let's start going back through this, all right?
[1:35:53.040 --> 1:35:58.040]  And we talk about how brutal this was and how she was choked during the ordeal and how
[1:35:58.040 --> 1:36:01.920]  she bit the man in question, okay?
[1:36:01.920 --> 1:36:07.160]  She was left with bruising after the alleged attack while there was also suggestions of
[1:36:07.160 --> 1:36:08.160]  bleeding.
[1:36:08.160 --> 1:36:17.160]  When we read the WhatsApp messages, it said he had her in pieces and it's worse than that,
[1:36:17.160 --> 1:36:18.160]  folks.
[1:36:18.160 --> 1:36:21.760]  It's something I really don't want to read on air, but we're going to read it on air.
[1:36:21.760 --> 1:36:27.040]  Oh yeah, and he had been accused of this before.
[1:36:27.040 --> 1:36:34.040]  He was previously accused of attacking another woman in recent months at a separate venue.
[1:36:34.040 --> 1:36:38.880]  So over all the other things we just showed you from 2020 when he got arrested and not
[1:36:38.880 --> 1:36:42.120]  charged, okay, for whatever happened in Frisco.
[1:36:42.120 --> 1:36:46.160]  That's not even what we're discussing here, okay?
[1:36:46.160 --> 1:36:53.120]  It's not even what we're talking about other ones within the past few months.
[1:36:53.120 --> 1:36:55.560]  Please read these articles.
[1:36:55.560 --> 1:37:00.240]  Please understand that these are actually thorough articles, all right, and instead what we're
[1:37:00.240 --> 1:37:07.280]  going to get now as this progresses is a hit piece that tries to, you know, of course
[1:37:07.280 --> 1:37:13.400]  say there was no criminal charges, no criminal charges again in a country where they didn't
[1:37:13.400 --> 1:37:19.160]  even name the guy and they have an 8% conviction rate, just point that out, okay?
[1:37:19.160 --> 1:37:25.840]  And he was not just accused of one other assault, but several, several prior to December 2018.
[1:37:25.840 --> 1:37:28.960]  Okay, and again, all these articles, they're up there.
[1:37:28.960 --> 1:37:30.760]  Police source.
[1:37:30.760 --> 1:37:35.920]  There are reports of previous incidents that happened also involving the sports star and
[1:37:35.920 --> 1:37:38.640]  members of his entourage in Ireland.
[1:37:38.640 --> 1:37:41.600]  These also may be revisited.
[1:37:41.600 --> 1:37:48.760]  And still by this time, all right, now you're well into December.
[1:37:48.760 --> 1:37:50.940]  You'll see it gets all the way into January.
[1:37:50.940 --> 1:37:55.280]  She is in a deep state of distress and she is absolutely terrified.
[1:37:55.280 --> 1:37:59.760]  She has allegedly been beaten by viciously during the incident.
[1:37:59.760 --> 1:38:01.640]  And she is terrified for her life.
[1:38:01.640 --> 1:38:03.720]  She is in absolute fear.
[1:38:03.720 --> 1:38:10.840]  Part of the problem is the sports star is linked to people who are dangerous, okay?
[1:38:10.840 --> 1:38:12.000]  What's that mean?
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:15.120]  Oh, I'll tell you what it means.
[1:38:15.120 --> 1:38:20.080]  He's mobbed up, not only mobbed up, but on a national level, why wouldn't you want this
[1:38:20.080 --> 1:38:22.000]  to come out?
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:25.520]  And I'm also going to show how the media are cowards on this one.
[1:38:25.520 --> 1:38:31.680]  Ari Emanuel, who is the guy that was presented in entourage by, as Jeremy Piven, that's the
[1:38:31.680 --> 1:38:33.200]  real guy, to his right.
[1:38:33.200 --> 1:38:40.280]  That's his brother, Rahm, you know, Obama Rahm, Chicago Rahm, good guy Rahm, all right?
[1:38:40.280 --> 1:38:43.760]  He wants to buy all of the UFC.
[1:38:43.760 --> 1:38:51.800]  Ari Emanuel actually negotiated a deal before the big sell, because right now, only half
[1:38:51.800 --> 1:38:54.840]  of it is owned by Endeavor, right?
[1:38:54.840 --> 1:39:00.600]  He negotiated a deal after the Khashoggi incident where the Saudi Arabians who'd already bought
[1:39:00.600 --> 1:39:08.400]  into the UFC and, you know, stood to gain financially just incredibly from a deal like
[1:39:08.400 --> 1:39:09.400]  that.
[1:39:09.400 --> 1:39:10.760]  They had to give back their state.
[1:39:10.760 --> 1:39:13.640]  They just had to give it back for the money they spent.
[1:39:13.640 --> 1:39:16.360]  They had no rights to it because of the Khashoggi deal.
[1:39:16.360 --> 1:39:19.080]  That's how crazy the world is, and Ari Emanuel knows it.
[1:39:19.080 --> 1:39:20.800]  Ari Emanuel knows all this stuff.
[1:39:20.800 --> 1:39:26.440]  In fact, you know, before we continue on, I want to point out this guy right here, ESPN.
[1:39:26.440 --> 1:39:28.560]  This is a TSN broadcaster.
[1:39:28.560 --> 1:39:31.240]  That's the Canadian ESPN.
[1:39:31.240 --> 1:39:38.560]  And Mr. Braunstetter, he got ahold of my threads and my information and my videos, and he started
[1:39:38.560 --> 1:39:39.760]  retweeting them.
[1:39:39.760 --> 1:39:44.280]  Well, that happened for about four or five hours, maybe even less, before he had to stop
[1:39:44.280 --> 1:39:45.280]  doing that.
[1:39:45.280 --> 1:39:46.480]  He knows what he did.
[1:39:46.480 --> 1:39:48.480]  He knows about McGregor.
[1:39:48.480 --> 1:39:49.480]  Okay?
[1:39:49.480 --> 1:39:51.480]  Kevin, I only know about McGregor.
[1:39:51.480 --> 1:39:56.080]  All the people that are in the press corps, they all know this, okay?
[1:39:56.080 --> 1:39:58.040]  And they're all hush-hush about it.
[1:39:58.040 --> 1:40:00.040]  They're all acting like it's no big deal.
[1:40:00.040 --> 1:40:04.520]  It's a big deal to me, and it shows, again, media management.
[1:40:04.520 --> 1:40:09.280]  So just to let everybody know, again, extensive reporting on this.
[1:40:09.280 --> 1:40:14.440]  Forensically, the hotel room has been identified and examined by forensic experts.
[1:40:14.440 --> 1:40:17.600]  CCTV has been downloaded, and we have spoken to staff.
[1:40:17.600 --> 1:40:22.200]  The woman has handed over bloodstained clothing to the police.
[1:40:22.200 --> 1:40:23.280]  That's Garde.
[1:40:23.280 --> 1:40:26.960]  And that is now being examined, all right?
[1:40:26.960 --> 1:40:34.320]  She's still too afraid to make a statement after Christmas, okay, weeks after the incident.
[1:40:34.320 --> 1:40:36.720]  Because again, she's been beaten.
[1:40:36.720 --> 1:40:40.320]  When you read the account, she doesn't remember much until she was actually on the way to
[1:40:40.320 --> 1:40:41.320]  the hospital.
[1:40:41.320 --> 1:40:44.880]  I mean, this is a serious incident.
[1:40:44.880 --> 1:40:53.000]  So finally, when he is arrested, okay, I believe it was on mid-January, a little bit after.
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:56.720]  He goes in, and he just tells the police it was consensual.
[1:40:56.720 --> 1:41:01.400]  They interviewed him, and then they let him go, and that's it.
[1:41:01.400 --> 1:41:02.400]  That's a wrap show.
[1:41:02.400 --> 1:41:04.080]  They waited, and waited, and waited.
[1:41:04.080 --> 1:41:06.040]  They waited, I think, over a year.
[1:41:06.040 --> 1:41:10.840]  Even a year and a half before they said they were not even going to criminally prosecute
[1:41:10.840 --> 1:41:13.600]  this, okay?
[1:41:13.600 --> 1:41:16.120]  And now we're going to get hardcore.
[1:41:16.120 --> 1:41:19.760]  Now we're going to show you these WhatsApp messages.
[1:41:19.760 --> 1:41:25.280]  Now I did, people, first of all, were saying it was a hoax, okay?
[1:41:25.280 --> 1:41:30.820]  But the bottom line was that eventually after he was arrested, even though it was illegal
[1:41:30.820 --> 1:41:37.120]  to do so, and this is on the 18th, RTE, which is a huge international news organization,
[1:41:37.120 --> 1:41:42.120]  somebody inside leaked that it was McGregor who had actually been arrested, and still
[1:41:42.120 --> 1:41:46.200]  the U.S. media, they didn't report it.
[1:41:46.200 --> 1:41:47.200]  Think about that.
[1:41:47.200 --> 1:41:53.120]  The U.S. media on top of Disney is also covering up for a sports figure.
[1:41:53.120 --> 1:41:55.320]  Why would they be doing that?
[1:41:55.320 --> 1:42:00.960]  And RTE was threatened with, like, a quarter million dollar fine for that leak.
[1:42:00.960 --> 1:42:05.440]  And then you look at this, and these, let's just say these numbers and otherwise were
[1:42:05.440 --> 1:42:09.320]  connected to journalists, were connected to sources, and we're going to read them on the
[1:42:09.320 --> 1:42:10.680]  other side.
[1:42:10.680 --> 1:42:17.320]  And if you hear this information and you are not completely and utterly repulsed at the
[1:42:17.320 --> 1:42:24.440]  situation we're currently in, and every time you see that person afterwards, I don't know
[1:42:24.440 --> 1:42:25.800]  what to tell you.
[1:42:25.800 --> 1:42:27.720]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[1:42:27.720 --> 1:42:34.040]  You need to support infowars.com, go to infowarsstore.com, pick up the latest and greatest video they
[1:42:34.040 --> 1:42:35.720]  got out there, COVID land.
[1:42:35.720 --> 1:42:44.160]  I know it comes with two other great films, Bohemian Grove, and listen, Order of Death.
[1:42:44.160 --> 1:42:48.480]  It's a film I used to show other people because it's so important to find out about these
[1:42:48.480 --> 1:42:49.480]  networks.
[1:42:49.480 --> 1:42:55.280]  The nepotism and the real power structure behind the scenes will see you for one more segment
[1:42:55.280 --> 1:42:57.200]  on the flip.
[1:42:57.200 --> 1:43:04.640]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[1:43:04.640 --> 1:43:07.200]  until the populations rebelled.
[1:43:07.200 --> 1:43:13.360]  They would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting
[1:43:13.360 --> 1:43:16.320]  anybody that speaks out against their laws.
[1:43:16.320 --> 1:43:21.840]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and
[1:43:21.840 --> 1:43:27.520]  whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[1:43:27.520 --> 1:43:34.000]  that it is a world government corporate takeover, and so it's pulling back the curtain now more
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:35.000]  than ever.
[1:43:35.000 --> 1:43:39.480]  The problem is some globalist-controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[1:43:39.480 --> 1:43:45.600]  Like Canada, where they've now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario and
[1:43:45.600 --> 1:43:48.600]  other areas of the world are following suit like Australia.
[1:43:48.600 --> 1:43:50.120]  So pray for these folks big time.
[1:43:50.120 --> 1:43:51.760]  This is a very serious situation.
[1:43:51.760 --> 1:43:56.400]  And stay tuned into Infowars.com because truth is absolutely paramount.
[1:43:56.400 --> 1:43:58.040]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome.
[1:43:58.040 --> 1:43:59.040]  Go ahead.
[1:43:59.040 --> 1:44:00.040]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[1:44:00.040 --> 1:44:01.040]  Good, bro.
[1:44:01.040 --> 1:44:02.040]  It's great last fall.
[1:44:02.040 --> 1:44:04.040]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplements.
[1:44:04.040 --> 1:44:12.040]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization, and
[1:44:12.040 --> 1:44:13.040]  absurdity.
[1:44:13.040 --> 1:44:15.840]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[1:44:15.840 --> 1:44:16.840]  All right.
[1:44:16.840 --> 1:44:17.840]  Eric in New Hampshire.
[1:44:17.840 --> 1:44:18.840]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[1:44:18.840 --> 1:44:19.840]  Go ahead.
[1:44:19.840 --> 1:44:20.840]  Hey, Alex.
[1:44:20.840 --> 1:44:21.840]  Thanks for taking my call.
[1:44:21.840 --> 1:44:22.840]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[1:44:22.840 --> 1:44:23.840]  The XQ does wonders.
[1:44:23.840 --> 1:44:24.840]  They recommend it to everybody.
[1:44:24.840 --> 1:44:25.840]  You're on the fence about it.
[1:44:25.840 --> 1:44:26.840]  Get off the fence.
[1:44:26.840 --> 1:44:27.840]  Get the product.
[1:44:27.840 --> 1:44:28.840]  Support the Infowars.
[1:44:28.840 --> 1:44:29.840]  Tyler in Maine.
[1:44:29.840 --> 1:44:30.840]  You're on the air.
[1:44:30.840 --> 1:44:31.840]  Thanks for rolling.
[1:44:31.840 --> 1:44:32.840]  Go ahead.
[1:44:32.840 --> 1:44:33.840]  Hey, Alex.
[1:44:33.840 --> 1:44:34.840]  It's great to be on with you.
[1:44:34.840 --> 1:44:35.840]  It's an honor.
[1:44:35.840 --> 1:44:36.840]  Honored to talk to you.
[1:44:36.840 --> 1:44:37.840]  Awesome.
[1:44:37.840 --> 1:44:43.320]  The first thing I wanted to do was say I love the products, Alpha Power, even at 29.
[1:44:43.320 --> 1:44:48.240]  If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom, so just number one
[1:44:48.240 --> 1:44:49.240]  for a few of us there.
[1:44:49.240 --> 1:44:50.240]  It definitely works.
[1:44:50.240 --> 1:44:51.240]  It's not a joke.

[1:45:29.840 --> 1:45:30.840]  tribes for centuries.

[1:45:56.840 --> 1:45:59.840]  With the world awakening, I think what's important that we were on the momentum right
[1:45:59.840 --> 1:46:02.840]  now, take advantage of this moment, and I have always had an idea that something everybody
[1:46:02.840 --> 1:46:06.840]  can do, that every listener can do, I think it could be powerful and effective for us
[1:46:06.840 --> 1:46:08.840]  to, you know, hang banners over highways.
[1:46:08.840 --> 1:46:13.840]  Imagine, you know, trying to be an artiste in a way that says Alex Jones is right in
[1:46:13.840 --> 1:46:16.840]  the war stop farm, or we stand with the truckers, or rest out, or whatever.
[1:46:16.840 --> 1:46:19.840]  Brother, I'm so glad you called, elaborate on this.
[1:46:19.840 --> 1:46:23.840]  Yes, now is the time in your small town or your big city to write something on the bathroom
[1:46:23.840 --> 1:46:28.840]  wall, or to put a sticker on your car, or banner hangs over highways, and it will be a
[1:46:28.840 --> 1:46:29.840]  chain reaction.
[1:46:29.840 --> 1:46:32.840]  What do you recommend people say on these banner hangs?
[1:46:32.840 --> 1:46:33.840]  I have a few ideas.
[1:46:33.840 --> 1:46:37.840]  First of all, help just as many people as possible to farm, rest out, rest while swap.
[1:46:37.840 --> 1:46:38.840]  The vaccine is poison.
[1:46:38.840 --> 1:46:39.840]  There's tons of things.
[1:46:39.840 --> 1:46:41.840]  I say just keep it short, keep it concise.
[1:46:41.840 --> 1:46:42.840]  No, I agree.
[1:46:42.840 --> 1:46:44.840]  Arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates.
[1:46:44.840 --> 1:46:45.840]  The COVID backs is poison.
[1:46:45.840 --> 1:46:46.840]  Beautiful.
[1:46:46.840 --> 1:46:49.840]  Yeah, there's ways that we could all be involved if we could all be effective though.
[1:46:49.840 --> 1:46:50.840]  That's what I'm calling about.
[1:46:50.840 --> 1:46:51.840]  God bless you, Chris.
[1:46:51.840 --> 1:46:54.840]  In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today.
[1:46:54.840 --> 1:46:57.840]  Thank you so much.
[1:46:57.840 --> 1:46:58.840]  Thank you.
[1:46:58.840 --> 1:47:15.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:15.840 --> 1:47:21.840]  Final segment of the Alex Jones show, I am Jason Burmes, and we're going to go deep into
[1:47:21.840 --> 1:47:28.840]  media management in this final segment via this McGregor information.
[1:47:28.840 --> 1:47:29.840]  Why media management?
[1:47:29.840 --> 1:47:37.840]  Well, Disney itself has had a long standing relationship with the media military industrial
[1:47:37.840 --> 1:47:38.840]  complex.
[1:47:38.840 --> 1:47:39.840]  What do you mean, Jason?
[1:47:39.840 --> 1:47:40.840]  Well, think about it.
[1:47:40.840 --> 1:47:47.840]  Disney was heavy, heavy media, especially for children and adults back in the day, and
[1:47:47.840 --> 1:47:51.840]  they worked vigorously with our military during World War II.
[1:47:51.840 --> 1:47:56.840]  You can watch those old propaganda cartoons with Donald Duck and others.
[1:47:56.840 --> 1:47:58.840]  That's just one aspect of it.
[1:47:58.840 --> 1:48:03.840]  When they wanted to buy up the land in Florida for their home base, what happened?
[1:48:03.840 --> 1:48:12.840]  The CIA created shell companies and then bought that land up at a fraction of the cost on
[1:48:12.840 --> 1:48:18.840]  behalf of this same agenda, and we're seeing more and more and more of that.
[1:48:18.840 --> 1:48:20.840]  I talk about signature reduction.
[1:48:20.840 --> 1:48:27.840]  I talk about the fact that these organizations like Google, YouTube, really alphabet, all
[1:48:27.840 --> 1:48:33.840]  of them, they are Trojan Horse civilian systems for a larger agenda.
[1:48:33.840 --> 1:48:39.840]  What we're going to look at here via McGregor and these WhatsApp messages is small time
[1:48:39.840 --> 1:48:41.840]  media management.
[1:48:41.840 --> 1:48:48.840]  The first thing that is being discussed, okay, not whether he's guilty or not, none of those
[1:48:48.840 --> 1:48:53.840]  things, or who's going to really break the story and be brave and put this out there.
[1:48:53.840 --> 1:48:54.840]  No, no, no.
[1:48:54.840 --> 1:49:00.840]  The first thing they're talking about is that the male in the UK is going to do the story,
[1:49:00.840 --> 1:49:03.840]  again, not naming him, saying, Irish sports star.
[1:49:03.840 --> 1:49:07.840]  Okay, but they had to get pulled into a massive meeting about it.
[1:49:07.840 --> 1:49:09.840]  We need to, what?
[1:49:09.840 --> 1:49:11.840]  To manage this information.
[1:49:11.840 --> 1:49:15.840]  McGregor getting named for the rape either today or tomorrow.
[1:49:15.840 --> 1:49:22.840]  The male UK and Ireland pulled all of their staff into a massive meeting about it last
[1:49:22.840 --> 1:49:23.840]  night.
[1:49:23.840 --> 1:49:24.840]  Now think about this.
[1:49:24.840 --> 1:49:25.840]  This is a sexual assault case.
[1:49:25.840 --> 1:49:34.840]  Can you imagine what we're talking about when we're talking about COVID-19, 84, viruses,
[1:49:34.840 --> 1:49:36.840]  lockdowns, shots?
[1:49:36.840 --> 1:49:37.840]  Oh my.
[1:49:37.840 --> 1:49:38.840]  Can you imagine?
[1:49:38.840 --> 1:49:41.840]  So let's move through this a little bit.
[1:49:41.840 --> 1:49:49.840]  Okay, so this person talks about how this might not be 100% truth, but it goes into the fact
[1:49:49.840 --> 1:49:56.840]  that this woman knows a friend of the family, okay, goes and starts talking to the entourage,
[1:49:56.840 --> 1:49:58.840]  and they're having a big laugh about it.
[1:49:58.840 --> 1:50:01.840]  He says that basically he's going to be with her later.
[1:50:01.840 --> 1:50:03.840]  She says no in front of everybody.
[1:50:03.840 --> 1:50:04.840]  Okay.
[1:50:04.840 --> 1:50:10.840]  And then they get back to the Beacon Hotel, and basically he's trying to get on with her,
[1:50:10.840 --> 1:50:14.840]  and she's like, get off, and he starts getting handsy and physical with her.
[1:50:14.840 --> 1:50:16.840]  I want to be really careful about reading this.
[1:50:16.840 --> 1:50:17.840]  Okay.
[1:50:17.840 --> 1:50:18.840]  Let's see.
[1:50:18.840 --> 1:50:19.840]  Yes.
[1:50:19.840 --> 1:50:28.840]  She ends up slapping him, and he flips and beats her up and holds her down and rapes her.
[1:50:28.840 --> 1:50:32.840]  She's on her flowers, which means her period.
[1:50:32.840 --> 1:50:37.840]  So he actually rapes her, you know where, afterwards.
[1:50:37.840 --> 1:50:42.840]  She's obviously distraught and goes straight to the SATU in Rotunda, where they arrive
[1:50:42.840 --> 1:50:47.840]  and try to find out what really happens, but don't get a lot out of her.
[1:50:47.840 --> 1:50:54.840]  Now, you get into this right here, and it gets even more disturbing, again, with these
[1:50:54.840 --> 1:50:56.840]  journalists talking to each other.
[1:50:56.840 --> 1:50:57.840]  He didn't use a condom.
[1:50:57.840 --> 1:50:59.840]  He came inside her.
[1:50:59.840 --> 1:51:05.840]  He left her covered in bruises, and she had throat injuries, which were consistent with
[1:51:05.840 --> 1:51:09.840]  someone held in a chokehold like the ones he applied in the ring.
[1:51:09.840 --> 1:51:12.840]  His DNA was all over her.
[1:51:12.840 --> 1:51:17.840]  He tried to ride her vaginally and rammed her tampon up into her cervix, so she had to
[1:51:17.840 --> 1:51:22.840]  have it surgically removed.
[1:51:22.840 --> 1:51:29.840]  And again, what does she get for trying to bring this guy to justice?
[1:51:29.840 --> 1:51:37.840]  Maybe she'll get some financial justice in March of this year, when the civil suit will
[1:51:37.840 --> 1:51:39.840]  finally continue.
[1:51:39.840 --> 1:51:41.840]  Let that sink in.
[1:51:41.840 --> 1:51:49.840]  Let that story sink in, that that's been held from the public eye, that Disney is making
[1:51:49.840 --> 1:51:56.840]  all sorts of money off of McGregor and his name and his image.
[1:51:56.840 --> 1:52:03.840]  And how that, again, is just a small microcosm for how the world actually works, and that's
[1:52:03.840 --> 1:52:10.840]  why information is power, because they couldn't get away with that if more people were informed
[1:52:10.840 --> 1:52:15.840]  and knew that these articles existed, that the evidence existed.
[1:52:15.840 --> 1:52:22.840]  And you could get into a plethora of other topics in which this is the case, almost everything
[1:52:22.840 --> 1:52:25.840]  at this point, right?
[1:52:25.840 --> 1:52:32.840]  And that's why it's so important that we not look to China and what they're doing, other
[1:52:32.840 --> 1:52:38.840]  than to use them as an example as what not to do, because we need to clean up our own
[1:52:38.840 --> 1:52:39.840]  backyard.
[1:52:39.840 --> 1:52:42.840]  Let me give you another instance of Mickey and the gang here.
[1:52:42.840 --> 1:52:44.840]  Mickey.
[1:52:44.840 --> 1:52:51.840]  Pre-COVID 1984, South Park, who I don't always agree with, who's actually attacked the 9-11
[1:52:51.840 --> 1:52:58.840]  Truth movement and myself personally, okay, puts out a stellar season going after Disney
[1:52:58.840 --> 1:53:05.840]  and China, and they use Winnie the Pooh, and it's pure golden sunshine with laughter mixed
[1:53:05.840 --> 1:53:07.840]  in between.
[1:53:07.840 --> 1:53:15.840]  And there, they have such a tight authoritarian grip that within days of the broadcast in
[1:53:15.840 --> 1:53:23.840]  which their great leader, Xi Jinping, is compared to Winnie the Pooh and Randy Marsh on behalf
[1:53:23.840 --> 1:53:32.840]  of a Disney deal to have weed legalized in China, ironically, kills Winnie the Pooh, okay?
[1:53:32.840 --> 1:53:36.840]  They canceled not only that episode, but South Park.
[1:53:36.840 --> 1:53:37.840]  Now, you repeat that.
[1:53:37.840 --> 1:53:40.840]  They canceled not only that episode, but South Park altogether.
[1:53:40.840 --> 1:53:43.840]  No, no, they didn't stop the show from running.
[1:53:43.840 --> 1:53:44.840]  They canceled it.
[1:53:44.840 --> 1:53:53.840]  They took the show away 20-plus years of satire, comedy, and commentary gone.
[1:53:53.840 --> 1:53:54.840]  See ya.
[1:53:54.840 --> 1:53:55.840]  We'll see ya.
[1:53:55.840 --> 1:53:57.840]  See ya.
[1:53:57.840 --> 1:54:00.840]  And now, that's done by the state.
[1:54:00.840 --> 1:54:03.840]  But more and more, what are we seeing?
[1:54:03.840 --> 1:54:11.840]  In this country, we have it done by these Trojan Horse civilian systems, the Googles, the Facebooks,
[1:54:11.840 --> 1:54:13.840]  the Twitters, right?
[1:54:13.840 --> 1:54:22.840]  The Disney's that are now in control of large sports operations, okay?
[1:54:22.840 --> 1:54:27.840]  Because ESPN and the UFC, they're like peanut butter and jelly right now, guys.
[1:54:27.840 --> 1:54:29.840]  You know, that's big money hustling.
[1:54:29.840 --> 1:54:34.840]  All the UFC pay-per-view rights in the United States, okay?
[1:54:34.840 --> 1:54:40.840]  Yeah, I don't have ESPN Plus for $7.99 or whatever they're charging me at this point,
[1:54:40.840 --> 1:54:44.840]  because I care about anything else but the UFC.
[1:54:44.840 --> 1:54:48.840]  In fact, I can't even purchase a pay-per-view anymore in this country
[1:54:48.840 --> 1:54:52.840]  without having to bend the knee a little bit to Disney.
[1:54:52.840 --> 1:54:54.840]  Boy, that makes me upset.
[1:54:54.840 --> 1:54:56.840]  God, that gets me angry.
[1:54:56.840 --> 1:55:00.840]  So, again, it's up to you guys, get this information out to people,
[1:55:00.840 --> 1:55:09.840]  and maybe just maybe not only will Disney be held accountable for associating themselves with somebody like that,
[1:55:09.840 --> 1:55:17.840]  but in the bigger picture, maybe Conor McGregor could be held criminally responsible for what he's actually done.
[1:55:17.840 --> 1:55:25.840]  Again, a microcosm for everything we talk about at InfoWars and on my broadcast is we want accountability.
[1:55:25.840 --> 1:55:32.840]  I'd love to see a fair trial where Fauci and the gang, where Andrew Capo, Cuomo, and Crue
[1:55:32.840 --> 1:55:40.840]  are actually tried for their crimes and then hopefully convicted and put in prison for the rest of their lives.
[1:55:40.840 --> 1:55:44.840]  In my opinion, the same thing needs to be done to Conor McGregor.
[1:55:44.840 --> 1:55:47.840]  Did you just hear what I read to you?
[1:55:47.840 --> 1:55:50.840]  Did you just see all of that evidence?
[1:55:50.840 --> 1:55:52.840]  I hope you did.
[1:55:52.840 --> 1:55:59.840]  Folks, I am Jason Bermas. Although I have a thing called a YouTube or whatever, they constantly take that from me.
[1:55:59.840 --> 1:56:02.840]  I'm sure you're looking behind me and going, what the heck is Rockfin?
[1:56:02.840 --> 1:56:05.840]  That's if you're watching the broadcast and not listening.
[1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:09.840]  Rockfin, R-O-K-F-I-N dot com slash Jason Bermas.
[1:56:09.840 --> 1:56:14.840]  That's where you can find all of my stuff, 100% completely uncensored.
[1:56:14.840 --> 1:56:16.840]  That's also how you can support my broadcast.
[1:56:16.840 --> 1:56:21.840]  If you do become a premium member over there, you get everybody else's premium stuff.
[1:56:21.840 --> 1:56:23.840]  Great other independent journalists over there.
[1:56:23.840 --> 1:56:26.840]  A lot of them on the left side, a lot of them on the right side.
[1:56:26.840 --> 1:56:29.840]  You know, Cernovich, who comes on this broadcast, he's over there.
[1:56:29.840 --> 1:56:31.840]  Jimmy Dore, he's over there.
[1:56:31.840 --> 1:56:34.840]  And of course, you get a whole lot of Jason Bermas and others.
[1:56:34.840 --> 1:56:41.840]  But most importantly, infowars.com constantly needs your support.
[1:56:41.840 --> 1:56:45.840]  They are under fire not only from the mainstream media, okay?
[1:56:45.840 --> 1:56:51.840]  Not only from the U.S. government, but really the predator class themselves
[1:56:51.840 --> 1:56:57.840]  that would like nothing more to have their great narrative control in a post-truth world
[1:56:57.840 --> 1:57:02.840]  where places like infowars.com and Alex Jones do not exist.
[1:57:02.840 --> 1:57:07.840]  So please, please, please consider getting in there over at infowarsstore.com
[1:57:07.840 --> 1:57:11.840]  buying a bunch of DVDs by every DVD they got.
[1:57:11.840 --> 1:57:16.840]  Make copies, hand them out, have those human experiences with your neighbors,
[1:57:16.840 --> 1:57:20.840]  friends, and family, and say, look, it's not about right or left.
[1:57:20.840 --> 1:57:21.840]  It's always about right and wrong.
[1:57:21.840 --> 1:57:23.840]  There is a predator class.
[1:57:23.840 --> 1:57:28.840]  They are making their move now, and we have to be very aware of that.
[1:57:28.840 --> 1:57:31.840]  Owen Schreuer is up next with The War Room.
[1:57:31.840 --> 1:57:32.840]  I hope you stick around.
[1:57:32.840 --> 1:57:33.840]  Check that out.
[1:57:33.840 --> 1:57:40.840]  And again, do everything you possibly can to support this operation, infowars.com.
[1:57:40.840 --> 1:57:44.840]  Alex Jones, freedom, truth, and independent journalism in general.
[1:57:44.840 --> 1:58:13.840]  Love you guys.
[1:58:14.840 --> 1:58:40.840]  Thank you.
[1:58:40.840 --> 1:59:06.840]  Thank you.
[1:59:06.840 --> 1:59:32.840]  Thank you.
[1:59:32.840 --> 1:59:57.840]  Thank you.
