[00:00.000 --> 00:12.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.600 --> 00:21.400]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:21.400 --> 00:32.040]  there's a million different ways I could open this broadcast up with and in my 20
[00:32.040 --> 00:37.280]  years on air maybe once or twice a year in the first decade I would say this is
[00:37.280 --> 00:41.640]  some of the craziest news I've ever seen and then the last four or five years I
[00:41.640 --> 00:47.080]  seem to say that every week or so because it just gets wilder and more
[00:47.080 --> 00:57.160]  obvious and more insane by the minute look at these headlines right now upon
[00:57.160 --> 01:03.120]  drudge report dot com congressional review of copyright may threaten drudge
[01:03.120 --> 01:09.600]  report and that's basically Congress admitting that Salman Rushdie the Nobel
[01:09.600 --> 01:17.880]  Peace Prize winner warns of new dangers to free speech in the West didn't rush
[01:17.880 --> 01:21.360]  he went one for literature I'm going from memory check it for me the point is
[01:21.360 --> 01:26.000]  award-winning author of the satanic verses which which aren't actually
[01:26.000 --> 01:29.200]  satanic he was just criticising erotica-lislam so he has a fought to
[01:29.200 --> 01:33.640]  wow if we're going to be killed I mean all the real liberals are coming out and
[01:33.640 --> 01:40.720]  saying we're in trouble fact there's an Atlantic monthly article that I'm going
[01:40.720 --> 01:44.440]  to be getting to in the next hour dealing with political correctness but I
[01:44.440 --> 01:49.560]  want to basically try to read the whole article because I'm about 60% decided
[01:49.560 --> 01:54.200]  that the author knows full well what's happening and is bringing people to the
[01:54.200 --> 01:57.320]  next level of tyranny but but maybe they're just ignorant so I want to speak
[01:57.320 --> 02:03.520]  directly to the Democratic Party elites main internal mouthpiece Atlantic
[02:03.520 --> 02:08.240]  monthly it's one of the most important publications to that group and they just
[02:08.240 --> 02:13.960]  decry the mass mental illness of political correctness well it's not a
[02:13.960 --> 02:19.080]  mass mental illness from the top it's directed the coddling of the American
[02:19.080 --> 02:23.200]  mind and how they're arresting development by design and turning people
[02:23.200 --> 02:27.120]  into gibbering minions of course they don't say that they say we don't know
[02:27.120 --> 02:32.000]  why there's such a great tyranny on the campuses did you hear of the cultural
[02:32.000 --> 02:36.120]  revolution cooked up at the Ford Foundation deployed through a mouse a
[02:36.120 --> 02:40.720]  tongue and the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation I mean I got David Rockefeller
[02:40.720 --> 02:47.000]  in the New York Times in 1977 bragging about how he was involved in all of it
[02:47.440 --> 02:56.800]  that's what they do is take a bunch of young spoiled stupid soft people and
[02:56.800 --> 03:00.040]  tell them you're gonna be the new authorities and find out which ones are
[03:00.040 --> 03:03.920]  the most diabolical and sick then they get foundation government funding and
[03:03.920 --> 03:12.160]  then get put in positions of power over us so they're now pointing at what
[03:12.160 --> 03:18.440]  they've created and they're doing that for a reason they know that the mainline
[03:18.440 --> 03:22.960]  liberals who have some classical liberal traits Jeffersonian traits are
[03:22.960 --> 03:27.160]  really starting to freak out and so they want to make you feel comfortable oh
[03:27.160 --> 03:32.720]  it's okay yeah oh the Democrats are upset Obama you know he goes and gives
[03:32.720 --> 03:39.520]  speeches and tells campuses you should have free speech while the people they're
[03:39.520 --> 03:49.520]  funding and the curriculum they're driving is the totalitarianism so we're
[03:49.520 --> 03:52.640]  gonna be looking at all that and it ties into a story that when I read it
[03:52.640 --> 03:57.760]  yesterday I had to read it two more times and then I actually went to the
[03:57.760 --> 04:03.680]  Georgia newspapers and actually went to the court filings at the smoking gun
[04:03.680 --> 04:08.920]  and other places I mean I did like an hour research on this I was reading this
[04:08.920 --> 04:15.160]  at lunch on my iPhone and I couldn't believe it and I thought about how
[04:15.160 --> 04:19.040]  surreal it was going to be to come here and go on air and discuss this and then
[04:19.040 --> 04:23.600]  I of course went and saw some of the videos of the confrontation and then I
[04:23.600 --> 04:27.800]  talked to people I know who are awake and and we're all so conditioned to living
[04:27.800 --> 04:38.320]  in tyranny that we just accepted it went on drinking our IFT and that's the
[04:38.320 --> 04:42.840]  little death right there that's when you start dying inside when we come back I'm
[04:42.840 --> 04:46.400]  gonna get to it Confederate flag supporters indicted under Georgia
[04:46.400 --> 04:52.400]  terrorism law they face decades in present for flying the rebel flag this

[08:01.000 --> 08:09.920]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[08:09.920 --> 08:18.720]  don't tread on me we're here live ladies and gentlemen on this Wednesday the
[08:18.720 --> 08:25.680]  14th day already of October 2015 we're going to have wide open phones
[08:25.680 --> 08:32.800]  throughout the broadcast today and cover some of the most revealing news that
[08:32.800 --> 08:37.640]  we've ever covered because there is a mass awakening happening while at the
[08:37.640 --> 08:42.400]  other side people are being polarized to new forms of totalitarian mental
[08:42.400 --> 08:47.760]  illness and I have six or seven articles on this front today we're going to be
[08:47.760 --> 08:54.200]  going over Salman Rushdie the Nobel Prize winner for literature warns of new
[08:54.200 --> 08:58.480]  dangers to free speech in the West and violence against writers and misplaced
[08:58.480 --> 09:02.040]  sense of political correctness poses new dangers to freedom of speech in the
[09:02.040 --> 09:10.080]  West he now published yesterday that dovetails with this Atlantic monthly
[09:10.080 --> 09:15.360]  article the coddling of the American mind and it basically says that young
[09:15.360 --> 09:19.520]  people on campuses are part of a mass mental illness of vindictive
[09:19.520 --> 09:26.880]  totalitarianism known as political correctness and they ask how did we get
[09:26.880 --> 09:30.680]  there and then the answer is massive mental health so they turn people into
[09:30.680 --> 09:36.880]  gibbering panic-stricken mentally ill people that are threatened by words by
[09:36.880 --> 09:42.480]  culture by conversation and then the very engineers of it after they've chopped
[09:42.480 --> 09:50.240]  off your legs give you a wheelchair for the price of your soul of course I mean
[09:50.240 --> 10:02.880]  I read this whole thing yesterday it's like 24 paid 27 pages long and if you
[10:02.880 --> 10:05.760]  understand this this is one of those Rosetta Stone things you understand
[10:05.760 --> 10:12.000]  everything I mean I'm sure this writer does full well as a social engineer what's
[10:12.000 --> 10:19.520]  going on and then sits there and goes what is this new totalitarianism that's
[10:19.520 --> 10:27.800]  what the Communist Party in China did to the youth corps and the youth brigades
[10:27.800 --> 10:34.240]  at the colleges and the high schools they they sat back and said oh it's
[10:34.240 --> 10:38.920]  terrible the young party officials children they're out burning and
[10:38.920 --> 10:46.280]  murdering and killing people oh the party didn't do it this is classic
[10:46.280 --> 10:52.640]  communist brainwashing and then now they've created this giant mass of
[10:52.640 --> 10:58.480]  petulant hateful power-crazed demons the type of folks you saw when we
[10:58.480 --> 11:01.800]  protested at Planned Parenthood a few months ago that crawled out from under
[11:01.800 --> 11:06.840]  rocks screaming we love Satan we're ugly we want to kill babies death murder
[11:06.840 --> 11:11.840]  Satan Satan and then chanting at the Capitol running around in circles is
[11:11.840 --> 11:20.080]  oh we love you Satan they they have no conscience they have no mind they were
[11:20.080 --> 11:23.960]  brought up by televisions they watched 40 plus thousand murders a year on
[11:23.960 --> 11:27.640]  television as children they're desensitized they're not real people
[11:27.640 --> 11:39.120]  their brains are wired wrong they're gone they're absolutely gone and it's
[11:39.120 --> 11:47.640]  very very sad and I'm not being negative I'm not exaggerating here you have to
[11:47.640 --> 11:58.160]  understand you have to understand folks this is scientific and I told you a
[11:58.160 --> 12:04.160]  few months ago you're gonna start seeing the left come out and decry political
[12:04.160 --> 12:10.640]  correctness of its extreme so they can control the debate and confuse people
[12:10.640 --> 12:15.560]  about what it really is now that there's a massive resistance to this Soviet
[12:15.560 --> 12:20.840]  technology transplanted here to the West now that Germans are being arrested
[12:20.840 --> 12:27.360]  mass if they protest thousands of Chechen men with pipes clubs and burning
[12:27.360 --> 12:31.760]  torches marching through German cities there's video of that on info wars.com
[12:31.760 --> 12:35.840]  now that people are waking up they're going to have to come in to lead the
[12:35.840 --> 12:40.360]  opposition and tell us what the good political correctness is that's already
[12:40.360 --> 12:45.280]  way more radical than what we currently live under but will sound like they're
[12:45.280 --> 12:50.040]  moderates compared to what their vanguard has basically announced no
[12:50.040 --> 12:56.000]  father no mother no boy no girl no single family dwellings no private
[12:56.000 --> 13:03.120]  property languages the enemy only approved language can be used oh we're
[13:03.120 --> 13:06.400]  going to be moderate and give you more reasonable things that are banned and
[13:06.400 --> 13:12.760]  this is how they move the Overton window incrementally where they wanted to go and
[13:12.760 --> 13:16.840]  I've read their PhD papers on it we've had guests on we've had sociologists on
[13:16.840 --> 13:22.600]  I mean Paul Watson had one on yesterday this is a known science of screwing
[13:22.600 --> 13:28.680]  people over and turning them into identity politics types who have no
[13:28.680 --> 13:34.360]  personal identity who are not individuals but our group think like
[13:34.360 --> 13:37.480]  lemmings or piranhas
[13:39.680 --> 13:42.680]  pack animals
[13:44.080 --> 13:48.560]  humans are extremely versatile and can be adapted to be the most amazing
[13:48.560 --> 13:51.640]  beautiful creatures we could ever imagine we can also be turned into the
[13:51.640 --> 13:58.080]  ugliest of monsters and the establishment is using humanity like a
[13:58.080 --> 14:05.440]  palette of different colors to paint a very ugly monstrosity let me just do
[14:05.440 --> 14:08.640]  this you can get why I'm so freaked out let me let me just read you these
[14:08.640 --> 14:16.120]  headlines okay rusty warns of new dangers of free speech in the West as the
[14:16.120 --> 14:20.960]  free speech is being banned the coddling of America daily call our
[14:20.960 --> 14:24.440]  congressional review of copyright law may threaten drudge report that's what
[14:24.440 --> 14:27.600]  congressmen are openly saying is being debated Supreme Court justices have told
[14:27.600 --> 14:30.200]  drudge they're coming for the free speech they've already done it in
[14:30.200 --> 14:35.120]  Australia and the UK and everywhere else I mean if Paul Watson wants to go out
[14:35.120 --> 14:40.800]  and demonstrate against radical Islam he will be arrested at the train station
[14:40.800 --> 14:46.480]  when he gets off every day in the news they arrest writers and journalists and
[14:46.480 --> 14:50.800]  anyone who criticizes radical Islam if you credit remember five years ago
[14:50.800 --> 14:57.400]  they banned Michael Savage go into England because he'd criticize radical
[14:57.400 --> 15:01.640]  Islam everybody said well that's just Michael Savage no it's not just Michael
[15:01.640 --> 15:07.920]  Savage it's gonna end up being everybody this is totalitarianism look at
[15:07.920 --> 15:11.680]  this next headline EU diplomat my government believes Obama is quite
[15:11.680 --> 15:18.280]  mentally ill big story up on drudge report calm from info wars calm I'm
[15:18.280 --> 15:22.120]  going to get to this story that is one of the most important articles dealing
[15:22.120 --> 15:24.880]  with the attack on free speech and I'll get into all the other geopolitical
[15:24.880 --> 15:32.480]  world news astrophysics news is over the top Wall Street declines on China fears
[15:32.480 --> 15:36.800]  weak profit expectations Walmart plunges after predicting decline in annual
[15:36.800 --> 15:45.200]  earnings and we always knew the Walmart economy would end up destroying
[15:45.200 --> 15:56.080]  Walmart but that's part of the plan I'll use the science fiction parallel of
[15:56.080 --> 16:03.600]  oblivion where the operatives think they're running one mission to resupply
[16:03.600 --> 16:07.400]  a space mission their compartmentalized on the earth they don't know they're
[16:07.400 --> 16:13.880]  working for a silicon advanced deep space life form that's actually draining
[16:13.880 --> 16:19.480]  the earth's oceans to power its hydrogen converters and go move on to the next
[16:19.480 --> 16:21.680]  planet
[16:26.680 --> 16:32.080]  and it's the same thing when people think globalism is going to eat itself it's
[16:32.080 --> 16:36.960]  designed to it's designed to suck up the resources consolidate them and turn it
[16:36.960 --> 16:41.920]  off it's a scientific plan on record
[16:41.920 --> 16:46.880]  I mean who wants to take part in a plan to do this but let me get to the story
[16:46.880 --> 16:53.840]  that was so incredible yesterday that I spent well over an hour researching and
[16:53.840 --> 16:59.920]  I couldn't believe it when I saw the Fox News headline Buckley texted it to me
[16:59.920 --> 17:06.280]  Confederate flag supporters indicted under Georgia terrorism law now have you
[17:06.280 --> 17:10.840]  grown up anywhere in the South or in East Texas on different Confederate
[17:10.840 --> 17:16.360]  holidays people getting their big four-wheel drive trucks they drive around
[17:16.360 --> 17:21.040]  with rebel flags and American flags if they do it at the beach if you're in
[17:21.040 --> 17:24.280]  Florida or Louisiana Mississippi Texas I mean this is just what you grow up
[17:24.280 --> 17:32.520]  around I have a complex historical view of it very very sad when I see it because
[17:32.520 --> 17:36.080]  I really know what it represents it represents the South being completely
[17:36.080 --> 17:41.680]  set up and being fools and I'm going to get to that here in just a minute but
[17:41.680 --> 17:46.440]  separate from that it is their free speech and the Confederate battle flag
[17:46.440 --> 17:49.760]  does not represent slavery other than the fact that some bad people have
[17:49.760 --> 17:54.120]  expropriated it but if you're able to ban the Confederate flag you're able to
[17:54.120 --> 17:58.880]  ban everything it will be right where Germany is where they take your
[17:58.880 --> 18:02.560]  children if you criticize the government socialism global warming that's in the
[18:02.560 --> 18:06.480]  news today they now arrest you in Germany for it they're trying to make it EU wide
[18:06.480 --> 18:11.760]  the UN wants it worldwide that's mainstream news today illegal to say
[18:11.760 --> 18:17.920]  that the carbon tax and global warming and all this is a fraud of course
[18:17.920 --> 18:22.280]  climate change is happening it's always happened this is the precipice we've
[18:22.280 --> 18:30.320]  reached and in Georgia they're in the whole Confederate flag fight where they
[18:30.320 --> 18:35.040]  put the guilt of 10 poor black people killed by mentally ill white
[18:35.040 --> 18:38.560]  supremacist onto anyone that supported southern heritage or anything else or
[18:38.560 --> 18:42.000]  Robert E. Lee who was an amazing individual according to the northern
[18:42.000 --> 18:46.360]  historians didn't own slaves Ulysses Grant did the northern general it's just
[18:46.360 --> 18:55.160]  all bull was the north wrong from a southern perspective yes but both sides
[18:55.160 --> 19:01.720]  were fools and I'm going to break that down because people need to know the
[19:01.720 --> 19:05.080]  full story and not have identity politics of you're a Yankee or you're a
[19:05.080 --> 19:08.760]  Southerner you need to understand the real paradigm and understand that we can
[19:08.760 --> 19:15.800]  go back to president Andrew Jackson 30 years before the Civil War when it
[19:15.800 --> 19:21.840]  almost happened before and his protoge Sam Houston who tried to stop the Civil
[19:21.840 --> 19:29.360]  War and was removed and was spit on and had things thrown at him in Texas because
[19:29.360 --> 19:33.960]  he said you're being set up by British intelligence of course he was right but
[19:33.960 --> 19:40.480]  that's a separate history lesson we come back imagine four or five trucks
[19:40.480 --> 19:45.000]  driving around with rebel flags on them black folks are all angry the media told
[19:45.000 --> 19:49.520]  them it's a symbol of killing black people they throw some bottles the police
[19:49.520 --> 19:54.040]  come no one's arrested and then the state indicts the people for the rebel
[19:54.040 --> 19:58.360]  flags saying that it was an act of terror that's saying free speech is an
[19:58.360 --> 20:03.080]  act of terror my name is Bill Bonner and I'm the president of the largest
[20:03.080 --> 20:07.520]  private news and research network in the world and I paid for this airtime
[20:07.520 --> 20:12.240]  because I have an important message to the American people there's a change
[20:12.240 --> 20:17.720]  coming that the government isn't telling you about this change has deep
[20:17.720 --> 20:23.080]  implications for life in America from where you shop to the doctors you visit
[20:23.080 --> 20:28.040]  and the family you want to protect look I've made predictions like this before
[20:28.040 --> 20:34.600]  thing is I was right then too a few years ago I warned that housing prices
[20:34.600 --> 20:40.840]  would collapse they did before that I warned that dot-com companies would
[20:40.840 --> 20:47.480]  crash they did those who listened had a chance to save themselves but this has

[24:15.360 --> 24:22.200]  exercised in communist China and now in Europe use coming here and is already
[24:22.200 --> 24:27.520]  here they use peer pressure they use bullying they use lawsuits now they're
[24:27.520 --> 24:30.600]  trying to pass laws federally and at the state level and are having some
[24:30.600 --> 24:37.520]  success saying that if what you speak hurts someone's feelings it's banned
[24:37.520 --> 24:42.800]  Facebook put out new rules two weeks ago and actually said if you disagree with
[24:42.800 --> 24:46.520]  someone you can be banned Twitter said the same thing
[24:46.520 --> 24:52.080]  communist China's internet czar over censorship met five months ago six months
[24:52.080 --> 24:57.800]  ago with Zuckerberg of Facebook to decide how to bring their systems to
[24:57.800 --> 25:03.160]  Europe the United States now China has announced they are heading up the UN
[25:03.160 --> 25:09.200]  body that will create a internet code of conduct
[25:09.920 --> 25:15.680]  Zuckerberg is caught on tape two weeks ago with Merkel at the UN saying I'm
[25:15.680 --> 25:20.360]  gonna restrict free speech they hire former Stasi to report on Germans and
[25:20.360 --> 25:26.360]  have them arrested you notice our media never criticizes China for organs
[25:26.360 --> 25:32.240]  anymore never criticizes China for banning free speech for because the move
[25:32.240 --> 25:37.920]  is being made to go to totalitarianism Cameron has gone public saying they're
[25:37.920 --> 25:41.320]  gonna restrict free speech in England and they are and saying our priority is
[25:41.320 --> 25:47.920]  not freedom anymore do you understand and I'm not trying to scare people it's
[25:47.920 --> 25:59.760]  here they're making their move they're making their move and then there's the
[25:59.760 --> 26:06.160]  video the best the Southern Poverty Law Center has is white people talking to
[26:06.160 --> 26:15.240]  black people and obviously I've I've been in East Texas walking out of a
[26:15.240 --> 26:19.360]  Dairy Queen when ten guys drive through in big jacked-up trucks and they're on
[26:19.360 --> 26:23.880]  their own little local gang and one of them looks at you because you're good
[26:23.880 --> 26:26.640]  looking you got a good-looking girl on your arm that's what it happens they go
[26:26.640 --> 26:30.000]  they you know they're like 18 got a beard already they're like what are you
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.400]  doing he ain't here and here well that's not what most people are like in the
[26:33.400 --> 26:41.560]  South and East Texas is the South the rest of Texas isn't and when you run into
[26:41.560 --> 26:45.080]  those folks they're just like running into a black gang in inner city that if
[26:45.080 --> 26:47.320]  you're a black guy they don't know they might say what are you doing around here
[26:47.320 --> 26:52.720]  boy it's just human territorialism and so yeah I've read all the angles all the
[26:52.720 --> 26:56.280]  articles both sides some people driving around with their trucks drove by some
[26:56.280 --> 27:00.680]  black people they got mad sort of throwing stuff at them and it was
[27:00.680 --> 27:06.840]  basically a just gang racial idiocy by both sides the police couldn't ask
[27:06.840 --> 27:10.560]  say any threats were made the videos don't show it but the state still
[27:10.560 --> 27:17.680]  indicted them in Georgia for flying what was the state flag just a few months
[27:17.680 --> 27:24.760]  ago and once the precedent is set on that the precedent is set for
[27:24.760 --> 27:31.200]  everything I mean I can't tell you how many times in high school or even
[27:31.200 --> 27:34.640]  college I'd be down at Corpus Christi or Shelf Padre and there's all these cars
[27:34.640 --> 27:37.600]  and trucks driving back and forth and then every 10th car would have a
[27:37.600 --> 27:44.000]  Confederate flag and you know they were a lot of times looking for trouble I
[27:44.000 --> 27:47.480]  mean you'd be at your bonfire or whatever and they pulled the what do you
[27:47.480 --> 27:51.560]  you know bleepers do it and if you said well get out of that car I'll stomp
[27:51.560 --> 27:55.160]  your head in the ground then they go no no we got beer let's party I mean it's
[27:55.160 --> 27:58.440]  that's not what all these people are like but the average Southerner is not
[27:58.440 --> 28:02.640]  driving around doing that so I've personally experienced stuff like this
[28:02.640 --> 28:10.520]  but is it terrorism absolutely not and I'm giving these black folks a benefit
[28:10.520 --> 28:15.160]  of the doubt and and saying maybe something happened to them because the
[28:15.160 --> 28:19.880]  media was invoking anybody that's got a Confederate flag wants to murder black
[28:19.880 --> 28:23.680]  people and you got black folks climbing in backyards front yards pulling down
[28:23.680 --> 28:27.280]  flags I mean you got the illegal aliens pulling down American flags at post
[28:27.280 --> 28:30.320]  offices now you got American flags banned all over the place in schools
[28:30.320 --> 28:36.480]  you've got the Union Jack being banned from the police to use it in the UK in
[28:36.480 --> 28:46.520]  England so it's here folks but when we come back I'll play the clip a Georgia
[28:46.520 --> 28:49.760]  grand jury charged 15 members of a group supporting the Confederate flag on
[28:49.760 --> 28:53.720]  terror charges following a July confrontation with a black family was
[28:53.720 --> 28:57.320]  celebrating a child's birthday according to the end indictment I can't
[28:57.320 --> 29:01.320]  believe it the indictment released Monday Douglas County District Attorney
[29:01.320 --> 29:06.320]  Brian Fortuner said members of the respect the flag group violated the
[29:06.320 --> 29:10.720]  state street gang terrorism and prevention act see they're not saying
[29:10.720 --> 29:14.480]  street gangs are terrorists and made terrorist threats when their caravan of
[29:14.480 --> 29:18.520]  vehicles bearing the rebel flag drove past the neighborhood and then they go
[29:18.520 --> 29:22.840]  and describe the flags and the group were meant to intimidate so it's
[29:22.840 --> 29:27.000]  terrorism I mean let me tell you when they have anti-gun rallies I get out
[29:27.000 --> 29:30.520]  there and bullhorn them and screaming people's faces and that's what a
[29:30.520 --> 29:33.360]  demonstration is to let them know we're not putting up with it are they gonna say
[29:33.360 --> 29:37.760]  I'm a terrorist because I fly the don't tread on me coal pepper militia flag
[29:37.760 --> 29:44.840]  because they're saying that's racist too the Marine Corps has banned it that was
[29:44.840 --> 29:49.760]  the Marine Corps flag before they even officially formed we're on the March the

[30:29.800 --> 30:34.800]  the outside it's rather a student in the classroom or more likely a student in my

[35:50.760 --> 35:54.320]  people yelling at each other over the national debate about the Confederate
[35:54.320 --> 36:02.360]  flag and so the white people are indicted on terrorism and face decades in
[36:02.360 --> 36:12.000]  prison if convicted and let me tell you the south a lot of demographers a lot of
[36:12.000 --> 36:15.240]  sociologists will tell you the north I'm not bachelor nor is just a fact is more
[36:15.240 --> 36:22.920]  racist on average widespread than the south and that's for a lot of
[36:22.920 --> 36:25.800]  sociological reasons there were not really black people in the north till
[36:25.800 --> 36:29.880]  the end of the civil war you had a bunch of other tribal groups you know dozens
[36:29.880 --> 36:32.920]  of different racial groups we're all fighting with each other already in the
[36:32.920 --> 36:37.000]  north people are already very racially based and religiously based in New York
[36:37.000 --> 36:43.760]  in Chicago and cities like that and so that's where you see a lot of that
[36:43.760 --> 36:52.800]  happening and taking place and in the south you have projected guilt by
[36:52.800 --> 36:56.800]  mainly the preachers on to whites in general even though two percent of
[36:56.800 --> 37:02.400]  whites had slaves to where it is a kind of kill a mockingbird syndrome where
[37:02.400 --> 37:09.840]  people in the south that I grew up around absolutely 100% had a guilt
[37:09.840 --> 37:17.040]  complex and were bought in you're buying into the modern liberal mindset
[37:17.040 --> 37:24.800]  because of that and so I would expect the juries will put these people under
[37:24.800 --> 37:32.880]  the jail and feel real good about themselves when they send these 15
[37:32.880 --> 37:39.160]  people to prison and the police got there talked to both sides conflicting
[37:39.160 --> 37:44.200]  stories basically people yelling at each other some of the folks at the
[37:44.200 --> 37:47.880]  birthday party some of the black folks reportedly throwing plastic bottles and
[37:47.880 --> 37:52.800]  things and yelling that's not terrorism that's just people getting hot emotions
[37:52.800 --> 37:57.480]  nobody's hurt nobody needs to be arrested well the state got involved the
[37:57.480 --> 38:00.880]  county got involved they want to show off to everybody like all these Republican
[38:00.880 --> 38:04.760]  governors taking down the Confederate flag and now folks are saying take down
[38:04.760 --> 38:16.160]  the American flag they are also flying American flags and I saw these idiots in
[38:16.160 --> 38:20.360]  the comments going where you fly and both the flags well both the flags were
[38:20.360 --> 38:24.800]  pretty honorable and the south of the north fought together against the
[38:24.800 --> 38:30.120]  British and we're all brothers and sisters as Americans and it just we've
[38:30.120 --> 38:34.120]  all been through this experience together and I want to get to other news
[38:34.120 --> 38:38.040]  it's just this is so important let's let's go and play the terrorism here's
[38:38.040 --> 38:41.840]  the terrorism not not funding ISIS like her government's doing not turning them
[38:41.840 --> 38:46.040]  loose all over the Middle East and Africa not opening our borders up not
[38:46.040 --> 38:48.840]  not doing all this no that's not the terrorism not shipping guns into
[38:48.840 --> 38:52.400]  Mexico to blame the Second Amendment fast and furious not having the IRS
[38:52.400 --> 38:56.440]  terrorized Christians and conservatives libertarians and veterans groups no no
[38:56.440 --> 39:02.520]  the terrorism is going out in Georgia with rebel flags and saying this is our
[39:02.520 --> 39:07.400]  heritage we're not giving it up and arguing with people heritage not hate
[39:07.400 --> 39:12.320]  and all the rest of it I'm gonna tell you the real heritage of the Confederate
[39:12.320 --> 39:17.960]  flag here in just a moment and you want the real history just a snapshot but
[39:17.960 --> 39:20.880]  still deeper than anything anybody's ever heard on the subject at least what I've
[39:20.880 --> 39:24.680]  heard on talk radio I'm gonna give it to you just briefly but let's go ahead and
[39:24.680 --> 39:33.880]  go to this club here this
[39:54.680 --> 40:19.760]  oh don't worry they've been indicted that's a threat that's a threat he
[40:19.760 --> 40:23.880]  talked to you that's a threat under political correctness it is they feel
[40:23.880 --> 40:27.840]  threatened anything that someone feel threatened by can selectively be enforced
[40:27.840 --> 40:33.480]  you're indicted for terrorism so you've got these overweight hillbillies classic
[40:33.480 --> 40:44.400]  whether cigarettes driving around with their flags flying it'd be one thing if
[40:44.400 --> 40:48.960]  they had a second federal flag on the front of a tank or something you know
[40:48.960 --> 40:53.320]  meaning not losing wars not backing down not you know not surrendering if it was
[40:53.320 --> 40:57.640]  honorable I don't think people like that running around acting like fools
[40:57.640 --> 41:02.600]  stirring up trouble you people disgrace the Confederate battle flag the way you
[41:02.600 --> 41:04.760]  act
[41:08.920 --> 41:13.240]  but this is what happens you get a bunch of people after ten black folks get
[41:13.240 --> 41:19.200]  killed rubbing in the pain rubbing in this flag means we're gonna murder you
[41:19.200 --> 41:22.840]  and you go to a shitty park and some black people start shooting their mouths
[41:22.840 --> 41:27.360]  off at you vice versa back and forth and you played right on the trap now does
[41:27.360 --> 41:32.000]  that mean you should be indicted for terrorism absolutely not now here's a
[41:32.000 --> 41:36.640]  quick snapshot of the Civil War and it's very complex I'm not gonna spend all
[41:36.640 --> 41:40.240]  day on it but this is this is what's in the mainline history books deep in there
[41:40.240 --> 41:46.640]  and it's what happened the south was agrarian the north was industrial the
[41:46.640 --> 41:50.280]  north had about four times the population of the south about three and a half
[41:50.280 --> 42:00.200]  times the north put internal tariffs on products for the South ship tobacco
[42:00.200 --> 42:08.160]  cotton wheat corn you name it to Europe but didn't put tariffs on
[42:08.160 --> 42:14.320]  manufactured goods out of the country this was going on since the 20s they
[42:14.320 --> 42:18.760]  almost had a civil war with Andrew Jackson but he was from the south he was
[42:18.760 --> 42:22.920]  able to stop it but the south was already mobilizing troops and he had to
[42:22.920 --> 42:27.040]  send them a letter and he called the southern delegation to dinner with him
[42:27.040 --> 42:31.600]  at the winehouse and he said I'm going to lead an army down there to defeat you
[42:31.600 --> 42:36.040]  right now you're not gonna do this and break the country up and they got some
[42:36.040 --> 42:43.560]  of the tariffs cut on the south so the south was getting fed on by the north to
[42:43.560 --> 42:52.840]  a certain extent British intelligence wanted to control Western expansion the
[42:52.840 --> 42:58.800]  United States was only out as far as the Midwest and Texas is that at that
[42:58.800 --> 43:06.440]  point a little bit west of the Louisiana purchase the British wanted to get back
[43:06.440 --> 43:12.360]  in there and wanted to break the south off from the north and basically make a
[43:12.360 --> 43:19.040]  treaty the British did sign interim agreement treaties with the south to
[43:19.040 --> 43:24.960]  supply them with weapons and armaments and to blockade and engage in ship
[43:24.960 --> 43:32.520]  warfare with the north British and this has all been written about in history
[43:32.520 --> 43:36.760]  books has been declassified decades later just like they had a secret treaty
[43:36.760 --> 43:40.520]  with the Nazis if they invaded the Soviet Union of course didn't follow the
[43:40.520 --> 43:46.680]  treaty in World War two British did not go along with their treaty with the
[43:46.680 --> 43:53.080]  south and let what Operation Ataconda not the one from Iraq but another one the
[43:53.080 --> 44:00.000]  north put a blockade all the way from Texas in the Gulf of Mexico all the way
[44:00.000 --> 44:09.040]  up to pass Virginia into Maryland and they cut the south off and many southern
[44:09.040 --> 44:13.880]  and western statesmen who were the real patriots said do not be part of this
[44:13.880 --> 44:18.760]  Robert E. Lee was against war with the north and said we that shouldn't happen
[44:18.760 --> 44:25.760]  and he was offered the command of the northern armies and when he refused to
[44:25.760 --> 44:29.760]  join the war in the south he was then offered command of the northern armies
[44:29.760 --> 44:35.320]  and it was such an insult because he was from Virginia and of course his father
[44:35.320 --> 44:40.120]  had been Light Horse Lee one of the main generals under George Washington and
[44:40.120 --> 44:46.800]  given the farewell speech at Washington's funeral first in war first in
[44:46.800 --> 44:52.400]  peace first in the hearts of his countrymen and he was just so blown away
[44:52.400 --> 44:59.280]  that he had to go with the states because he was a constitutionalist he did
[44:59.280 --> 45:03.280]  not own slaves the head of the northern armies later of course Ulysses S. Grant
[45:03.280 --> 45:09.200]  did so there is incredible ignorance when you see the demonization of the
[45:09.200 --> 45:20.040]  Confederate battle flag it's the flag basically a Robert E. Lee but here from
[45:20.040 --> 45:26.680]  the handbook of Texas State Historical Association from the state website you
[45:26.680 --> 45:31.120]  can go and read the quotes and the statements by Sam Houston you know
[45:31.120 --> 45:38.600]  Houston's named after him the father of Texas sent here by President Andrew
[45:38.600 --> 45:48.480]  Jackson in the early 1930s 1830s to basically set up the movement that would
[45:48.480 --> 45:56.920]  then be the takeover of Texas from Mexico and he said in public letters when
[45:56.920 --> 45:59.560]  he was governor this is after he'd been president and they had President Jones
[45:59.560 --> 46:04.960]  and then it became a state the Lone Star State by treaty and then he became
[46:04.960 --> 46:10.600]  governor he said this is as governor he said to secede from the Union and set up
[46:10.600 --> 46:15.120]  another government would cause war if you go to war with the United States you
[46:15.120 --> 46:19.120]  will never conquer her as she has the money and the men if she does not whip
[46:19.120 --> 46:22.720]  you by guns powder and steel she will starve you to death that's what she did
[46:22.720 --> 46:27.000]  it will take the flower of the country the young men in the name of the
[46:27.000 --> 46:31.840]  Constitution of Texas which has been trampled upon I refused to take this
[46:31.840 --> 46:36.180]  oath it was a loyalty oath I love Texas too well to bring civil strife and blood
[46:36.180 --> 46:43.360]  shed upon her I declare that civil war is inevitable and is near in hand when it
[46:43.360 --> 46:47.280]  comes the descendants of the heroes of Lexington and Bunker Hill will have
[46:47.280 --> 46:51.240]  found equal in patriotism courage and heroic endurance with the descendants of
[46:51.240 --> 46:56.720]  the heroes of cow pens and Yorktown for this reason I predict the civil war
[46:56.720 --> 47:04.240]  which is now in hand will be stubborn and of long duration I mean this is this
[47:04.240 --> 47:08.040]  is what this guy was like Davey Crockett been in hundreds of hardcore battles
[47:08.040 --> 47:11.480]  there was one account we have like five arrows sticking out of him in Tennessee
[47:11.480 --> 47:18.960]  and they spit at him they laughed at him they they ran around who we're gonna
[47:18.960 --> 47:22.160]  beat everybody's but we're gonna be everybody's but and and and see that's
[47:22.160 --> 47:26.680]  why the civil war is a great defeat of this Republic a very sad disgusting of
[47:26.680 --> 47:32.320]  them and the north came in at horrible atrocities and just the carpet
[47:32.320 --> 47:38.160]  baggers the scallywags it was terrible and a great federal tyranny was founded
[47:38.160 --> 47:45.600]  out of it that we live under now today and so that's the reality here it is
[47:45.600 --> 47:49.520]  from the state historical society about Sam Houston but when he refused to take
[47:49.520 --> 47:52.320]  the other loyalty the newly formed Confederacy's of America the Texas
[47:52.320 --> 47:56.040]  convention removed him from office on March 16th and replaced him with
[47:56.040 --> 48:02.360]  Lieutenant Governor Edward Clark two days later reportedly during these
[48:02.360 --> 48:05.680]  traumatic days President Lincoln twice offered Houston the use of federal
[48:05.680 --> 48:10.120]  troops to keep him in office in Texas in the Union offers that Houston declined
[48:10.120 --> 48:13.560]  again to avoid making Texas a scene of violence yeah he just he couldn't
[48:13.560 --> 48:16.880]  betray Texas he couldn't betray him the United States he couldn't he just
[48:16.880 --> 48:21.040]  couldn't be an idiot and you can read there are literally dozens of his letters
[48:21.040 --> 48:25.640]  about we're being manipulated by foreign powers we are we really this stupid we
[48:25.640 --> 48:29.080]  need to do what Jackson did we need to stop this right now that you're being
[48:29.080 --> 48:39.240]  manipulated into war and it was done and now a hundred and sixty years later a
[48:40.920 --> 48:45.720]  hundred and fifty five years later they will arrest you and charge you for
[48:45.720 --> 48:54.280]  terrorism if you fly the Confederate flag and people's feelings get hurt so you
[48:54.280 --> 48:57.040]  can see where political correctness goes they wind up all the so-called
[48:57.040 --> 49:01.360]  minorities to see racism and hate everywhere when they get upset you get
[49:01.360 --> 49:08.080]  arrested and when that precedent is set it's gonna be everybody I mean you
[49:08.080 --> 49:11.000]  understand folks what's happening in Europe is now happening here where they
[49:11.000 --> 49:16.560]  arrest you for demonstrating I don't agree with the Ku Klux Klan but they have

[54:59.400 --> 55:03.720]  nation's copyright laws and then it goes through the House Judiciary Committee
[55:03.720 --> 55:10.160]  with 20 hearings and the statements that political news such as the drudge
[55:10.160 --> 55:17.920]  report could be seen as political speech and could be restricted and then it goes
[55:17.920 --> 55:20.320]  on the daily caller to link to his interview from last week saying drudge
[55:20.320 --> 55:24.240]  report site owner Matt Drudge told Alex Jones of info wars last week the

[55:44.240 --> 55:48.600]  by the two former heads of special forces for the army the heads of special
[55:48.600 --> 55:54.760]  forces being told stuff by members of Congress being told stuff by a vice

[56:03.120 --> 56:11.840]  the specifics but it's got all the quotes with the Democratic Ranking Member
[56:11.840 --> 56:17.240]  John Conyers openly making statements about restricting free speech and
[56:17.240 --> 56:22.360]  bringing back the fairness doctrine for talk radio they mean business folks they
[56:22.360 --> 56:26.120]  mean business and I'm going to cover this after we open the phones up in the

[56:57.720 --> 57:03.240]  like to get international laws in place where you can be arrested well that's

[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:09.080]  here's the deal Europe basically follows in a consensus the directives of NATO
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:17.360]  in the United States it's all one big crew and a lot of Europeans do not want
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:22.480]  to have war with Russia they've got a recent memory how that was you know how
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:25.520]  it's 20 million dead Germans that that'll make you know I'm getting those
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:32.400]  fights 20 million Russians died too that'll that's that's not very fun is

[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:45.640]  a hand at our war makers man they knew how to put us in machines and an
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:49.040]  aircraft and use machines to do a killing the Russians just did it with
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:02:03.400]  rifles but this is a big deal and Obama is mentally ill dr. Pachinic is a
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:09.440]  Harvard psychiatrist MIT scientist one of the fathers of modern psych warfare
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:13.160]  the Pentagon he's been wanting to come on we're gonna him on but he says Obama's
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:19.640]  mentally ill and he says most these people are mentally ill and I tend to
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:24.160]  agree with it I mean you've got to be really mentally ill don't want to shut
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:30.360]  down our coal power plants that are completely clean you've got to be
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:35.360]  mentally ill as an elite when you run the world basically to want to turn the
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:39.720]  power off and jack with humanity and dumb people down you've got to be really

[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:57.200]  humanity's destiny is truly unlimited and we've got to make it off-world we've
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:08.680]  got to transcend and and really take on God's promises and we've got to
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:11.840]  realize there are people that want to control the future destiny of humanity
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:17.320]  and want to shutter the mind of perception the windows of perception the
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:26.160]  doors of perception because they are so insecure they have knowledge of how
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:35.320]  humans operate but instead of letting the bird fly they want to cage it so we're
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:40.060]  gonna be covering that video mass migrants chanting Allah Akbar rally in

[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:46.960]  yawn by most in two months that is huge EPA spent 75 million to equip 200
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:51.880]  special agents with drones night vision goggles guns and assault ships assault
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:56.480]  ships all right that's just some of the news there I also want to go over 36 facts
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:59.640]  that prove that the United States of America is an exceptional nation but
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:04.680]  it's very sarcastic stop on infowars.com by Michael Schneider I want to get on
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:10.680]  the show and it goes over the 30 plus things that were exceptional in and you
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:20.320]  guessed it it's low test scores obesity low IQs our IQs have dropped more than
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:25.800]  14 points since 1955 just type that in you can look it up yourself
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:32.680]  physically it's not education physically we're getting dumber well yeah you also
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:40.200]  read the Harvard study on fluoride what does it say a 10 to 14 drop at 1.3
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:45.320]  parts per million after five years exposure as an adolescent or as a child
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:54.240]  to hydrofluorosalic acid 14 IQ point drop oh and our IQ drop 14 points oh
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:59.000]  I mean you know it's like you got a whole thing of keys you go up to some
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.080]  rent house you start sticking keys in and finally one of them opens the door
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:06.400]  that's the key that opens the door the IQs down 14 points since they try to put
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:16.840]  in fluoride in the water the key goes in the door and then I could show you
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:20.160]  eco science wide-out science are countless documents where they go yeah we
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:24.720]  put hydrofluorosalic acid in the water to lower IQ lower fertility and it also
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:29.040]  works as an adjuvant so that all the other drugs they add to the water oh
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:35.320]  believe me they add them I had a high-level Republican one time tell me a
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:39.840]  top computer programmer that he was gonna come he has a TV show leave it at
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:44.760]  that but he was gonna come on the show and expose that when he did two years of
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:54.040]  work in a Pacific Asian nation Singapore that he was met with the
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:56.760]  government ministers and all that and that they actually put drugs in the
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:02.120]  water depending on what section of the city people are in and that's how
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:05.760]  controlled and tested it was and then he was putting in these computer
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:10.840]  algorithms to basically study the statistics after it and then he
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:15.560]  chickened out wouldn't come on the show and never talked to me again I mean I
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:22.480]  just find it interesting I mean we're not in Kansas anymore do you think they
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:28.840]  just sell body parts of babies illegally do you think they just stop there they
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:34.520]  see you as dumb cattle and guess what a lot of you act like it so that's coming
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:43.960]  up and then this report I'm gonna hit this in the last segment of this hour
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:48.280]  daily mail it's up on info wars comm as well have researchers discovered an
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:53.440]  alien megastructure bizarre star could be surrounded by a dyson sphere built by
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:56.880]  extraterrestrials researchers claim
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:05.640]  KIC 8462852 located 1,489 years away was monitored by the Kepler space
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:08.920]  telescope for more than four years beginning in 2009 oh they just now
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:13.680]  tell us about it now researchers say they cannot explain strange fluctuations
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:18.120]  in light it emits leading some to claim it could have a huge alien
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:24.280]  megastructure in front of it yeah it looks like it's behind a lens we've
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:31.240]  never seen anything like this star and it goes on from there
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:39.760]  can you imagine the stuff we don't know about and we're busy looking at Hilary
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:48.520]  Clinton during the debates all right I'm going to go to Chavon Allen Simon
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:56.320]  Curtis Bill and others here in just a moment 800 25 9 9 2 3 1 Democrats score
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:00.280]  9 million less viewers than Republicans in their mindless debate last night
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:03.560]  about who could give away the most goodies
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:11.920]  and then I think about Jeb Bush caught with a pro-life senator's aid with her
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:16.800]  hands on her hips bugging her eyes out like how dare you not like women just
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:21.960]  all in grandstanding to manipulate women to make a national issue just see
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:28.440]  that woman stand up to him all theater all posing meeting with behavioral
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:33.040]  psychologists had to put her hands on her hips look at him with pure hatred and
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:39.000]  CNN goes did your mother ever look at you like that Trump this is how they
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:48.120]  stage stuff this is how dumb they think we are and whether Trump's a good guy
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:53.640]  or not this is how they pull these scams it's like Michelle Malcolm I'm not
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:16:00.520]  against Michelle Malcolm I agree with her almost up she said that I was a liar
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:08.760]  years ago and said it was a robot dog that Marines threw off a cliff I'm not
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:11.680]  against the Marines I'm against the defense of that type of behavior killing
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:22.120]  a puppy for no reason and enjoying and she went out and wrote an article and
[01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:26.480]  said I was liar now the Marines had even come out and said we discipline them it
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:34.320]  was a real dog and then she had guys with her yelling kill Michelle Malcolm
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:38.880]  leaning down behind me with cameras on me yelling kill Michelle Malcolm and they
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:44.760]  ran a national hoax that day hard copy extra NBC News CBS News it was all over
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:49.560]  I got calls from National Talk Show host saying Alex you may be over for you
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:54.640]  saying kill a woman beat up a little woman and we got our video our video
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:58.440]  showed they were doing it thank God we have a video from behind but this is the
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:02.280]  type of stuff they can pull I'm not saying that Howard Dean was a good guy
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:06.880]  but he was going to end up basically beating Hillary beating Obama he was a
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:16.160]  popular guy and so they ran that hoax where they you know isolated the
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:20.040]  microphone that was a corduroy not corduroy how do you how do you pronounce
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:24.200]  it Cordus microphone cardioid cardioid that said I'm having a moment
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:27.920]  cardioid where it only picks up what singers use you in a rock band or
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:30.680]  whatever only picks up what's right in front of it not the background which
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:34.760]  sounds like he's screaming everybody's howling and they go all the scream and
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:39.960]  again those type of stunts they try to do that with Trump right there and when
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:47.160]  you've experienced them running a national stunt on you it's not fun but
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:54.040]  we survived that Malcolm deal because we had the proof and because I didn't
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:58.440]  apologize but I mean it was in the Denver Post the Dallas Morning News it was
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:03.800]  on Rush Limbaugh he wasn't on then it was a guest host I mean by the next day it
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:07.120]  was in hundreds of publications that I wanted to kill a woman and then I said
[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:10.560]  kill her with a crowd and tried to kill her

[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:23.480]  thank you for calling thank you for having me on how are you I'm good ma'am I
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:29.280]  am calling to touch base on a couple of things in regarding African-Americans and
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:37.080]  their involvement not only in racism but amongst the way society see us I was
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:43.400]  raised partially north and south and I spent 13 years up north and I see things
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:48.600]  that people don't want to talk about and people don't want to acknowledge first
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:54.320]  of all I know for a fact that there are more black people than white people that
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:59.360]  teach their children hatred that teach their children that society owe them
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:04.560]  something that if anything don't go their way it's because of what somebody
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:09.680]  else has done we no longer unfortunately teach our children
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:15.960]  accountability and responsibility and that is not only a big part of the
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:21.240]  problem but that will continue to be a big part of the problem because we don't
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:24.920]  want to we don't want to take responsibility well it's political
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:29.200]  correctness ma'am I mean my dad said growing up black people were like the
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:33.520]  most honorable upright people he knew and then he would just marvel living in
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:37.600]  Dallas the crime and the and the craziness but that is what breaking up
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:42.600]  the family did that's what they're now doing to everybody's culture and it's
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:46.800]  this victimology that people are given and you can really see the divide and
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:52.120]  conquer is there any way to try to reverse that there is one way in a lady
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:56.240]  told me when we got into a discussion about this one day that in order for
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:26:02.120]  things to change all the older people whether they're hurt into anybody with
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:07.800]  a thought process of it's not my fault it's their fault anybody black or white
[01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:13.640]  need to just go and in order that I told her in order for that to change we
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:18.520]  got to change what we're teaching our children if we I don't care what color
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:23.400]  you are if you're not teaching your child accountability and responsibility
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:28.240]  and quit putting the blame and the focus that if something don't go my way that
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:33.160]  is somebody else's fault no no matter what another person does you have
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:37.160]  choices and you have to be held accountable for your choices a person
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:40.640]  can sit there and call me whatever because I have the rebel flag I'm married
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:47.680]  to a white man okay I can choose how I respond to you and I teach our children
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:51.960]  that life is about the choices you make it don't matter what another person do
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:56.160]  if you can choose how you react or deal with that situation but you got to be
[01:26:56.160 --> 01:27:00.720]  prepared for the consequences of your choices that's right you're absolutely
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:04.800]  you're absolutely right ma'am God bless you I appreciate your call that's what
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:09.480]  it comes down to and the globalist want to make us dependent so that paradigm
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:13.800]  becomes true that we're not responsible for ourselves and then we're slaves
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:18.080]  that's why they don't want individualism because it doesn't fit in a corporate box
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:22.920]  they can control great points ma'am thank you Curtis in Wisconsin you're on the
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:27.040]  here go ahead Curtis yeah it's good to finally talk with you Alex you're a
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:34.200]  difficult man to reach welcome um thank you my I have one point is a good thing
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:39.720]  is diet Pepsi removed aspartame out of the 20 ounce and cans that's pretty good

[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:52.900]  myself alone I've worked like woke up many people to a lot of the issues and
[01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:58.200]  at first they you know call me crazy and like oh you're an anti-vacciner but now
[01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:03.320]  they're really starting to get it you know that's what I found is I almost
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:06.800]  heard about it I talked to his anti-vaccine unless they're old and I
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:10.640]  see the sickest people lined up when you go to Walgreens or whatever you know
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:14.200]  get a prescription there's like 10 people lined up to the nurse off in a
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:19.000]  cubby-hole to get shots and I've gone over Leanne McAdoo to an undercover
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.240]  report last year where they're not giving you the inserts they're telling
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:25.440]  you everything's safe and effective they're not giving you the insert
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:32.640]  they're not telling you go ahead yeah it's pretty sick man um is I have a
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:37.120]  question for like the iodine in the winter sun I'm a big I love that stuff

[01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:50.720]  dose to a 22 month old sir I am not a medical doctor and so I'm not gonna
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:57.800]  advise you on that I would talk to a healthcare practitioner that you trust
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:03.280]  and like I personally according to body weight of doctor group and a couple
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:09.720]  times a week in water with vitamin B12 and with winter sun I put it in the
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:15.840]  water even though it's not absorbable the kids like it it tastes good B12 and
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:20.680]  these things mixed together have a nice flavor and the children drink that
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:28.280]  that's what I personally do and they've been a lot healthier but I cannot advise
[01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:32.960]  you on what you should do for yourself you see what I'm saying yep exactly thank
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:36.240]  you very much on making that pretty clear thank you and then I have one more
[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:39.760]  point of both the democratic debate I watched that last sure stay there we're
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:42.680]  gonna come back to you Curtis I don't want to cut you short everybody stay
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:47.240]  there we'll be back I got some clips of the debate coming up to
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:54.640]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:57.080]  network
[01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:03.680]  kit Daniels info wars.com did you know that guns are less deadly than alcohol
[01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:07.720]  at least 88,000 deaths per year are attributed to alcohol abuse and 30
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:11.920]  people per day die in alcohol related auto accidents in the US alone heavy
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:16.200]  drinkers are also more prone to violence suicide and risky sexual behavior in
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:20.160]  comparison there were 36,000 gun related deaths including suicides and
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:24.920]  accidents in the US in 2013 and as a percentage of all causes of death alcohol
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:28.600]  related deaths are over twice as common as deaths involving firearms even more
[01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:32.360]  interesting one-third of gun deaths are alcohol related so according to gun
[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:35.880]  control logic we could eliminate one-third of gun related deaths overnight by
[01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:39.480]  banning alcohol yet you'll notice that mom's maned action and other Bloomberg
[01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:43.000]  back groups aren't demanding we ban booze and beer that's because the true
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.520]  agenda behind gun control is to control the population because the government
[01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:49.680]  can only expand at the expense of individual rights such as the Second
[01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:52.840]  Amendment Rodney MacKin of the Mises Institute wrote an excellent article
[01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:56.280]  breaking all of this down including the statistics I cited so check it out at
[01:30:56.280 --> 01:31:03.840]  infoworse.com and once again this is Kit Daniels and it's that type of behavior
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:08.440]  that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:13.120]  that was designed to smooth out and help children focus all of our children are
[01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:18.160]  hit with modern mind control television music fast food GMOs sugars you name it
[01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:21.600]  young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being
[01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:26.600]  hammered daily by globalist concoctions it's no wonder they can't focus and
[01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:30.720]  calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs working with my team

[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.280]  guys my age were freighter girls I would I remember just listening to songs they
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:45.240]  played it like every 20 minutes
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:49.080]  bring it up I love it
[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:53.080]  I've done Randy Rhodes on guitar
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:34:07.480]  okay I'm going to get into America number one 36 facts that prove the
[01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:11.160]  United States is an exceptional nation but not the way you think and the
[01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:14.040]  economy after I run through some more of these calls these are some really good
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:20.560]  calls let's talk to Curtis in Wisconsin you had one more point go ahead yep the
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:24.800]  Democratic debate where Hillary said she'd support any state with free
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:30.320]  schooling for undocumented citizens was pretty much the sickest thing I've
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:34.520]  ever seen in my life it just made me upset to see I was like I'm gonna shut
[01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:39.600]  it off yeah I watched some of our coverage of it our crew did a great
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:45.480]  job and it was just like a feeding frenzy of the goodies they're gonna give
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:50.920]  people for free that's taken from someone else and then you realize they're
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:55.400]  trying to cut the economy off so only they can give you stuff to totally
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:59.800]  control you that's the really big crime I mean socialism itself is bad enough and
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:06.840]  Bernie Sanders explaining how socialism will save capitalism truly sickening I
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:09.600]  appreciate your call that we're gonna play some of those clips thank you have
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:13.120]  Bernie Sanders on socialism I know we had that can we can we cue that up and
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:24.120]  play that it is really hard to even look at Bernie Sanders who let me define
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:29.040]  socialism for you ultra reds robber barons want to get rid of the free
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:33.440]  market and competition they domesticate the public they take most of what you
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:36.880]  produce they give you part of it back and then they keep the lion's share for
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:41.000]  select insider corporations that then take over the economy in the words of
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:44.280]  the founder of the Rockefeller dynasty
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:50.480]  competition is a sin and that's why you always have the elites funding it and
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:59.440]  I'm so tired of it it's rule by gangs it kills the free market it kills being
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:05.440]  able to vote with your dollars it is an abomination let's go to the club you
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:09.120]  call yourself a democratic socialist how can any kind of socialist win a
[01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:12.960]  general election in the United States well we're gonna win because first we're
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:17.400]  gonna explain what democratic socialism is and what democratic socialism is
[01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:22.800]  about is saying that it is immoral and wrong that the top one-tenth of 1% in
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:28.760]  this country own almost 90% almost own almost as much wealth as the bottom
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:35.760]  90% that it is wrong today in the world economy that 57% of all new income is
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:41.400]  going to the top 1% that when you look around the world you see every other
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:47.440]  major country providing health care to all people as a right except the United
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:52.960]  States you see every other major country saying to moms that when you have a baby
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:57.320]  we're not gonna separate you from your newborn baby because we are going to
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:03.760]  have but we are gonna have that medical and family paid like every other
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:10.840]  country on earth those are some of the problems that I believe in people from
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:14.240]  the UK come here to get health care and our health care screwed up people from
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:18.040]  Canada come here he just sit there goes everywhere else is a totally wonderful
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:26.800]  place welcome to McDonald may I help you I'm any sign dance I have a 70 IQ I mean
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:35.520]  it's truly disgusting my name Bill I work McDonald thank you I'd like to do it
[01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:42.840]  he just sits there shoveling those lies I thought we got free health care I
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:47.080]  thought Obamacare did that Bernie oh we need bigger government it'll finally be
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:51.240]  delivered to us right right
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:57.760]  yeah they've got more doctors any other country in the world in Cuba and you
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:06.000]  can't get heart surgery there basically need eye surgery here's a cane need knee
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:15.520]  surgery here's a cane I was watching a great film that strangely enough ends
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:21.400]  with yours truly about a month ago about William F. Buckley and Gorba doll and
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:26.840]  I've talked about it here on air someone belaborate the best of enemies and in
[01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:31.240]  it it shows like 20 minutes and two hours or more of the seven debates they
[01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:39.560]  had on NBC News during those you know early 1970s debates and Gorba dolls going
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:44.680]  over the numbers the same class warfare stuff to William F. Buckley of National
[01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:48.360]  Review and he's saying under the exact numbers but I'm not another number from
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:50.880]  the time but again you can go watch the film and see the actual numbers but he's
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:39:00.080]  like 10% remember that 10% have got 45% of the wealth in this country and that's
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:06.760]  wrong and we're gonna redistribute it and that's fair and Buckley's like you
[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:10.280]  can't ever make everyone equal well now that we've got a robber baron
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:16.440]  collectivist crony capitalism it is 2% with about 87% it's not 90 like
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:26.120]  Sanders said now that's a lie too it's not 2% that have 87% about to be 90%
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:32.880]  a few years we did the math one day of the 6,000 superclass that even the
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:37.240]  Kissinger group estimates really run things and have most the wealth it was
[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:44.320]  going from memory here if you divide 6,000 do it again guys 6,000 in the 7
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:50.160]  and a half billion it was point zero zero zero zero zero zero was six zeros
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:56.080]  one point zero zero zero zero zero zero two four if memory serves I'm going
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:40:00.880]  from memory like 11 zeros I'm sorry okay CJ did at the time was 11 zeros I'm
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:03.480]  just going from here well can we just put that on screen maybe and do it for
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:11.760]  folks here because it's point a whole bunch of zeros and then a 2-4 I remember
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:21.000]  that they've done the numbers you could take all the wealth of people making a
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.200]  million dollars a year down to about a hundred thousand the upper middle class
[01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:31.000]  and wealthy and it wouldn't pay the national debt for one year we've gone
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:36.280]  from the biggest creditor biggest saving nation in the world to the biggest
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:39.680]  debtor nation under under socialism under globalism and of course you need a
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:44.160]  bunch of ignorant people that don't know what's going on that don't know what
[01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:47.600]  inflation is that don't know why they can't get ahead and then they have no
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:54.080]  hope because the whole system so game in the service economy that they really
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:58.320]  think Bernie Sanders is going to give them something does anyone have any
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:02.640]  idea how hellish socialist and communist countries are I mean they're hell
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:11.600]  on earth child labor slavery corruption you I mean you think free market
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:18.560]  creates wealth the problem is it creates spoiled rotten brats two three
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:21.720]  generations down the road I don't care if you're Hispanic black white mixed
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:30.480]  whatever you are our poorest Americans are wealthier than people in the third
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:34.080]  world who are middle class and they've been caught taught to have chips on
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:43.720]  their shoulders and to run around and be so angry and not feel adequate I sit
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:47.920]  there and I people watch how insecure folks are how they are all scared to
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:51.600]  talk and they're looking back and forth I mean people have not had any real
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:42:02.480]  experiences and that's what this big Atlantic monthly article gets into we'll
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:08.800]  put it up on screen if we can about the coddling of America to where they
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:14.160]  basically think that what's happening on college campuses is people are having
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:19.200]  anxiety disorders the coddling of the American mind and it goes on to admit
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:23.640]  mass political correctness is total mental illness and totalitarianism and
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:32.600]  that they want words now like black band but this is your children this is what
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:35.880]  you created they don't know how to build they don't know how to dream they
[01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:38.360]  don't know how to write they don't know how to work they don't know how to
[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:44.480]  strive they know how to get in groups and invent how they've been oppressed as
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:48.720]  they're being inducted into huge debts where there'll be no job for them in
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:58.120]  the future unless it's in government or a select corporation and they marvel it
[01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:10.200]  hell it's a tyranny well that's who you are that's what you've created and so

[01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:47.240]  with that little bit absence oh but still it did work perfect I even though I
[01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:50.680]  believe you guys I just I couldn't believe until I actually see no listen
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:54.440]  listen I believe group in Anthony Uchi already two three years ago I just kept
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:57.800]  saying no no no give me a break I'm gonna this this regiment wasn't that hard and
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:01.400]  then didn't happen for me the next morning it happened the next night like
[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:06.800]  like two days later day and a half later and I was just like I mean it's like a
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:10.160]  movie it's like aliens coming out of here somebody's like you like that was in
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:15.520]  my that was in my body it is so so without getting too graphic since you
[01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:19.640]  called in on a gone trade agreement I don't need to get graphic but did did
[01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:24.680]  did what we described happen it is exactly how you described and I tell
[01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:28.040]  everybody about it like me I'm lucky it was only the green balls that came out
[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:32.520]  so I wasn't like super super toxic like some people are but still I just to see
[01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:37.400]  it was I couldn't believe myself I just can't believe that it's like not like
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:42.040]  national infomercials and that big big companies aren't doing this I mean I
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:46.360]  you know I just can't believe that no one knows about this because I was ignorant
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:51.200]  too you don't believe that that there's all these balls in your you know gall
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:55.040]  bladder and liver you don't but you don't believe that till I don't even I
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:58.400]  can't let me talk about it on air but it's true I'm a private guy but it's
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:04.200]  too dramatic to not talk about go ahead I'm sorry yeah no it was like I said I
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:08.880]  tell everybody about it I even took a picture and like you said it's
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:13.360]  graphic but it you have to take it to show people like I told my mom about it
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:16.840]  she couldn't believe me she thought that as soon as you drop oil into water that
[01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:20.600]  turning turns into balls I was like I tried to explain her no mom that's not
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:24.480]  where these are actually like hard balls that are sitting in your belt like she
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:29.040]  had to get her removed because obviously it was too toxic but well that's the
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:32.440]  thing and you know sometimes you do need a surgery I mean I'm not against
[01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:36.240]  Western medicine entirely it's great we got a broken leg or a hernia or a tooth
[01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:41.080]  you got to get worked on it's just that they just want to slice something out or
[01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:44.880]  take it out they won't ever tell you that like changing your oil or flushing your
[01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:48.560]  fuel system you can do that with your body if you aren't too far gone now what
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:52.000]  was your point on the trade agreement now I want to I just want to ask you a
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.200]  quick question because if anybody knows we're having our elections here in
[01:48:55.200 --> 01:49:00.080]  Canada actually there are October 19 and it seems like Harper is the only one
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:05.000]  like he supports the TPP and it just seems like any other people that we can
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:08.920]  vote for is either socialist or you know he's basically the only one thing he's
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:13.360]  not going to raise our taxes and I also heard that it was that he called this
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:17.280]  election early because he knows that they're gonna be ratifying this in
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:21.440]  December in the UN or something like that so he wanted to make sure he was in
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:26.320]  you know I'm confirmed those sources but that's all true and Canada is one of
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:30.120]  the key votes on it was one of the deciding votes finally getting it through
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:36.480]  and notice it was signed a week and a half ago we still can't see it all we
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:39.840]  got was three sections leaked by WikiLeaks and the three sections we've
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:43.600]  got are Sodor County into free speech free trade everything I mean it is a
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:50.160]  global treaty they call a trade deal and it's global government and it's being
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:54.160]  kept secret from the American people and it's been kept secret from the
[01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:59.760]  Canadian people and they mainly have conservatives in Europe Canada Australia
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:03.360]  you name it pushing it like hey it's trade it's business it's good for
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:07.560]  business and then they've got leftist like Bernie Sanders opposing it which
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:12.640]  then makes conservatives think it must be good no no it is obama trade and it's
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:17.760]  secret so it shouldn't be signed and I mean what else do you say about it again
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:22.440]  it's so over the top it's like saying 15 Georgians were arrested for flying
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:28.160]  Confederate flags for terrorism I mean you don't even I don't believe that when
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:32.240]  I said myself but it happened it's like secret treaties are being signed
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:35.760]  sections of it show the end of free speech the takeover of factories and
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:39.600]  businesses and allows multinationals to shut down any corporate I mean it's just
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:48.200]  so crazy that we're already in the global government and the general public
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:52.200]  isn't politically aware enough to understand that thank you Alan we're

[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:53.400]  there to certain point that's what it's meant to do it's a consolidation curve

[01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:52.960]  have vestiges of greatness in my view folks we still have the seeds that can
[01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:56.680]  make us great but we are exceptionally nasty and exceptionally stupid and
[01:57:56.680 --> 01:58:02.920]  exceptionally evil and we have exceptionally bad people running us he

[01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:04.840]  X2 it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred
[01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:09.120]  years the federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine
[01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:12.640]  accrued form of it be added to table salt because of the incredible health

[02:08:03.160 --> 02:08:10.840]  resistance to tyrants his obedience to God it's Alex Jones you can run on you
[02:08:10.840 --> 02:08:19.640]  can run on for a long time run on for a long time run on for a long time
[02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:25.240]  sooner or later you gotta put you down new report out this is the London Guardian
[02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:31.480]  Christianity under global threat due to persecution says report in places like
[02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:36.720]  North Korea China but also at the hands of radical Muslims but when Christians
[02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:40.480]  get put to death by the tens of thousands of years just the Middle East and
[02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:48.560]  North Africa alone you don't hear a word out of the left and even the UN's own
[02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:51.920]  report earlier this year admitted that persecution against Christians has
[02:08:51.920 --> 02:08:58.520]  doubled in the last five years and that Christians now are more persecuted than
[02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:11.280]  all other groups combined combined and you turn on the news you can see the
[02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:15.720]  persecution of Christianity and they've persecuted it more than just attacking
[02:09:15.720 --> 02:09:19.400]  it and they've they've been taxing it they've been regulating it they've been
[02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:25.200]  harassing it they've been irasing it but more importantly they've been coming
[02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:30.400]  in to the World Council the National Council of Churches and the Ecumenical
[02:09:30.400 --> 02:09:35.560]  Movement and turning the Catholic Church Protestant Church you name it into
[02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:42.760]  social engineers into globalist behavioral modification experts and if
[02:09:42.760 --> 02:09:46.560]  the public would just wake up to the fact that you are under psychological
[02:09:46.560 --> 02:09:51.920]  warfare attack I mean it's been going on for a long time but they've now
[02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:56.320]  admitted it and they admit it's domestically run by the Central
[02:09:56.320 --> 02:10:06.800]  Intelligence Agency that's right they estimate 80% of all acts of religious
[02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:16.600]  discrimination in the world or against Christians now continuing you have to
[02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:21.520]  ask yourself why is that because the UN doesn't care about other religions they
[02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:27.200]  want to keep those going they don't like Christianity and it's because real
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:33.400]  Christianity cares about the individual cares about the soul cares about the
[02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:38.440]  unborn real Christianity ended slavery real Christianity tried to empower
[02:10:38.440 --> 02:10:42.960]  people I grew up a Christian had a relationship with Christ I've been born
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:47.680]  against I was about five six years old but I question my faith not intensely
[02:10:47.680 --> 02:10:53.520]  but I did let people question it I did research it maybe when I was 18 19 years
[02:10:53.520 --> 02:11:00.520]  old but then in a worldly way researching though how things really
[02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:06.000]  work I discovered the globalist are heavily into the dark side of the
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:17.000]  occult I've never met a globalist that was an atheist and they're all very
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:25.680]  superstitious very religious and they all are into what you'd call classical
[02:11:25.680 --> 02:11:36.400]  Western black magic and you can say well what is that humans are incredibly
[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:41.640]  powerful what we envisioned a hundred years ago 20 years ago 10 years ago is
[02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:50.000]  now reality look at how far we've come from caves and sticks and stones to
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:53.920]  today and then ask yourself how much further we could go we've already
[02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:59.080]  traveled the equivalent of thousands of light years up the developmental chain
[02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:09.320]  the next jumps are going to be limitless and so that's the big crown that's the
[02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:12.880]  brass ring that's the
[02:12:12.880 --> 02:12:24.920]  ultimate goal of the globalist is to attain that race to the singularity and
[02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:40.120]  to not let the profane the uninitiated cross into that new level and so while
[02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:45.640]  we're obese while we're watching football and while we're in this fake
[02:12:45.640 --> 02:12:52.080]  plastic artificial TV culture and while men run around totally frantic not
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:54.800]  knowing how to be men and women run around frantic not knowing how to be
[02:12:54.800 --> 02:12:59.760]  women and while the society unravels the social engineers are there laughing the
[02:12:59.760 --> 02:13:04.320]  minute people realize this engineering's going on the minute people are aware of
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:10.040]  the attack we're designed to respond to it and overcome it and deal with it but
[02:13:10.040 --> 02:13:18.440]  they've gotten people in an arrested development unconscious insecure mode
[02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:28.880]  where people are extremely lazy and they don't understand that it's an
[02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:34.600]  animating contest of life and that it's fulfilling to be informed it's fulfilling
[02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:39.920]  to be involved it's fulfilling to know what you're talking about it's also
[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:45.320]  monetarily successful it's culturally successful I can tell you rich and
[02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:51.360]  powerful people successful people honorable people cool people want to be
[02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:58.960]  around other thinkers and they want to build up other people the general public
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:03.800]  thinks if somebody else gets ahead they're behind and the elite think that
[02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:12.400]  to and the top elite have succeeded in turning the general public into something
[02:14:12.400 --> 02:14:24.760]  very akin to them and it's a very explosive combination when it begins to
[02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:29.440]  unravel and it is unraveling now and it's designed to unravel and rock and
[02:14:29.440 --> 02:14:37.360]  slowly collapse into the new system and then out of that comes the false new
[02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:43.800]  Atlantis that the elite are building all around us with our treasure our name our
[02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:51.720]  blood our ingenuity our minds our creativity when the truth is the United
[02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:58.480]  States of America according to the founding fathers and Francis Bacon and
[02:14:58.480 --> 02:15:06.280]  all those that came before him is the new Atlantis that's why we lead the world
[02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:11.760]  and we've been captured by a spirit of evil that wants to use us to take over
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:18.000]  the world while destroying us we're having our birthright to be the new
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:29.920]  Atlantis stolen from us your birthright robbed from you and your family as we
[02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:38.240]  disintegrate the reality is so big so beautiful so compelling that you could
[02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:47.120]  join the fight against dehumanization you could be part of truly building a
[02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:54.200]  powerful world and a lot of you are part of that but you've got to realize
[02:15:54.200 --> 02:15:58.200]  you're greater destiny and just how amazing you are and to do that you've
[02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:01.400]  got to understand and do what I've done the last five years and I'm certainly
[02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:07.080]  not perfect but I've lost nearly 70 pounds you can I don't even tell you guys
[02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:10.320]  I was gonna do this but you can pull up the before and after photos I haven't
[02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:12.960]  taken a photo in like three four months I've lost even more weight I now
[02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:19.640]  standing up straight have a six pack with a tiny bit of fat I mean my my
[02:16:19.640 --> 02:16:24.640]  belly is 95% gone it was huge at like 30 pounds of fat 40 pounds just on my
[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:31.480]  belly and I've done it by saving my exercise I was just getting healthy not
[02:16:31.480 --> 02:16:37.400]  eating GMO taking supplements and that's why Dr. Group joins us right now to
[02:16:37.400 --> 02:16:47.200]  talk about the move the war against our fertility and again what we're showing is
[02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:51.600]  just me earlier this year and then 45 days later I'd already lost like 60
[02:16:51.600 --> 02:16:56.600]  pounds there I just lost another seven or eight by the end of that one month you
[02:16:56.600 --> 02:16:59.680]  can pull up you know shots of me three years ago four years ago at Goldberg in
[02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:07.000]  England that's where I got my fattest about 280 but but I'm digressing I'm
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:10.840]  gonna skip this network break we're on a Dr. Group of the Global Healing Center
[02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:14.120]  one of the main formulators and designers of a lot of the products this is
[02:17:14.120 --> 02:17:17.400]  not an infomercial today we're gonna plug a few things to supermail is in the
[02:17:17.400 --> 02:17:20.720]  truck it's it's you can order it now it's basically back in it gets here Monday
[02:17:20.720 --> 02:17:24.880]  so when I get that first it's back in but he's here to talk about this because
[02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:28.120]  I said what is the most important thing in the world he said the attack on the
[02:17:28.120 --> 02:17:31.760]  human species it is scientific you're absolutely right here's the London
[02:17:31.760 --> 02:17:40.120]  Telegraph why is male fertility so under so under researched the problem with
[02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:43.600]  conventional medicine treatment of menstrual symptoms and female infertility
[02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:47.960]  declining male fertility rates due to excess chemical exposure research shows
[02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:52.320]  Fox News scientists grow human sperm and lab cure for infertility see they're
[02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:55.440]  gonna make you where you don't work so you've got to go to the system to
[02:17:55.440 --> 02:18:01.400]  survive it's to make you unnatural and take over your innate power the attack
[02:18:01.400 --> 02:18:06.440]  on men and women coming together in passion and love and creating a new
[02:18:06.440 --> 02:18:11.680]  human and that bond with that little sweetie cake baby the attack on that the
[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:18.680]  attack on the male and female is a demonic abomination the state and
[02:18:18.680 --> 02:18:22.840]  groups getting in between a man and a woman and their life together and acting
[02:18:22.840 --> 02:18:27.560]  like that's some big fight and that's some big war is the ultimate attack on
[02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:35.480]  the species it's what aliens would do if they wanted to slowly kill off humans
[02:18:36.120 --> 02:18:39.800]  they do it chemically they do it culturally they do it spiritually and
[02:18:39.800 --> 02:18:48.160]  they've done it and Dr. Group joins us to break down this war and some of the
[02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:51.920]  things that are admitted in mainline literature that can't reverse at all
[02:18:51.920 --> 02:18:56.720]  anybody that says that's unless you catch this stuff really early but can
[02:18:56.720 --> 02:19:00.960]  certainly jumpstart get around the chemicals that turn off your switches
[02:19:00.960 --> 02:19:04.480]  and do other things and that's basically what I've done part of being fertile is
[02:19:04.480 --> 02:19:11.520]  your healthy your skin's healthier your eyes are sparkly you're alive and with
[02:19:11.520 --> 02:19:17.200]  natural compounds exercise pure water meditation prayer a lot of things you
[02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:25.920]  can reduce some of the damage that's been done but if you don't respond and if
[02:19:25.920 --> 02:19:28.880]  you're not aware you're really in trouble and by the way knowing you're
[02:19:28.880 --> 02:19:33.960]  under attack is also half the battle Dr. Group thank you so much for joining us
[02:19:33.960 --> 02:19:37.680]  today great to have you with us my friend hey it's great to be on and
[02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:41.320]  congratulations I know you've been working really hard at getting yourself
[02:19:41.320 --> 02:19:46.960]  back in shape and getting healthy and really it all comes down to in men
[02:19:46.960 --> 02:19:52.640]  especially we lose we start losing our hormones and infertility
[02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:58.760]  sterility the attack that we have on the population the globe it really comes
[02:19:58.760 --> 02:20:03.640]  down to endocrine disrupting chemicals and a hormone imbalance that's being
[02:20:03.640 --> 02:20:09.680]  caused by many things that we talk about fluoride the phthalates the the BPH but
[02:20:09.680 --> 02:20:14.720]  more and more we're seeing individuals that are having problems getting
[02:20:14.720 --> 02:20:19.040]  pregnant I mean it's really hard for someone to bring a baby into this world
[02:20:19.040 --> 02:20:23.120]  these days and that's all done by design to with the population control
[02:20:23.120 --> 02:20:27.680]  situation but hormones are nothing more than chemical messengers in your body
[02:20:27.680 --> 02:20:31.640]  that allow for different systems and glands in your body to communicate with
[02:20:31.640 --> 02:20:36.240]  each other and as I started doing more research by the way I had a book on
[02:20:36.240 --> 02:20:41.040]  getting pregnant and natural fertility that the FDA came in and made me take
[02:20:41.040 --> 02:20:47.520]  down so I know firsthand that they're trying to keep this information to
[02:20:47.520 --> 02:20:52.040]  themselves and trying to restrict people from getting pregnant and using
[02:20:52.040 --> 02:20:56.640]  science these scientific methods these devices they're trying exactly what you
[02:20:56.640 --> 02:21:01.640]  said they're instigating divorce they're instigating instigating
[02:21:01.640 --> 02:21:06.000]  pornography they're trying to separate the male and the woman they're trying to
[02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:11.600]  separate those feelings of love and affection and natural childbirth they've
[02:21:11.600 --> 02:21:16.080]  been doing that when they also went to cesarean sections instead of natural
[02:21:16.080 --> 02:21:21.280]  childbirth now more than half in the US are cesarean that's right there's a lot
[02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:25.560]  more money and a lot less time involved with cesarean they and then they're
[02:21:25.560 --> 02:21:29.640]  also contaminating everybody pregnant women now especially with flu shots and
[02:21:29.640 --> 02:21:34.000]  vaccinations so I wanted to come on today and talk about some natural methods
[02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:41.360]  people can use and you mentioned also some of the robotic or futuristic
[02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:47.640]  techniques of what we're looking into and that's something that you know we
[02:21:47.640 --> 02:21:50.520]  haven't even talked about you've talked about the spider goats but that's
[02:21:50.520 --> 02:21:56.320]  transgenics and transgenics is actually an organism whose genomes have been
[02:21:56.320 --> 02:22:01.760]  altered by a gene from another species and talking about fertility this goes
[02:22:01.760 --> 02:22:07.840]  hand-in-hand because DARPA has been funding not only DARPA but you the all
[02:22:07.840 --> 02:22:14.480]  of the military the army navy marines and big pharma to test drugs using
[02:22:14.480 --> 02:22:19.760]  animals with human genes to bypass some of the FDA human clinical trot studies
[02:22:19.760 --> 02:22:25.680]  to test drugs safely and now we even have transhumanist association here and
[02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:29.320]  and there are animal rights there are human rights lobbies there is no
[02:22:29.320 --> 02:22:34.000]  transgenetic lobby so they say a cow that's part human doesn't have any rights
[02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:38.160]  and human Z's even the Washington Post invented a decade ago they have in
[02:22:38.160 --> 02:22:43.040]  China and places like that but also in Costa Rica of all places in government
[02:22:43.040 --> 02:22:47.960]  labs these are almost completely human but because they've added some some
[02:22:47.960 --> 02:22:52.880]  chimpanzee genes they claim that they have no rights because they're not
[02:22:52.880 --> 02:22:57.280]  chimpanzee they're not human and notice you don't hear PETA or anybody even talk
[02:22:57.280 --> 02:23:01.000]  about this this just just like I knew 20 years ago that Planned Parenthood was
[02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:04.480]  selling baby parts and it was admitted in lawsuits then now everybody knows
[02:23:04.480 --> 02:23:10.160]  well there are human Z's and and other human primate crosses all over the
[02:23:10.160 --> 02:23:15.240]  place and they're doing unspeakable horrors to these humanoids this is
[02:23:15.240 --> 02:23:19.560]  something that it nobody really knows is going on and there's billions and
[02:23:19.560 --> 02:23:24.120]  trillions of dollars being funded I mean even it's a giant Manhattan project on
[02:23:24.120 --> 02:23:29.600]  steroids yeah in 2006 the Department of Health funded case law school it was
[02:23:29.600 --> 02:23:34.880]  close to $800,000 to develop guidelines for how to deal with human
[02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:39.440]  enhancement in the future you're having part human part animal or a part animal
[02:23:39.440 --> 02:23:45.160]  part human and at what point is it 25% human that that they fall under
[02:23:45.160 --> 02:23:51.640]  constitutional rights so this is this amount of money that was given to case
[02:23:51.640 --> 02:23:58.600]  law school was for them to develop government policy that can be extended to
[02:23:58.600 --> 02:24:02.920]  transhumanist that's how the Constitution will affect a part human
[02:24:02.920 --> 02:24:06.760]  entity so this stuff's been going on for a long time and there's a race it's like
[02:24:06.760 --> 02:24:11.520]  a nuclear race that we had with Russia back in the day sure they're going to
[02:24:11.520 --> 02:24:14.120]  find when they believe the keys to immortality you just put the article on
[02:24:14.120 --> 02:24:18.280]  screen for viewers this is all being documented by dr. group right now and so
[02:24:18.280 --> 02:24:21.680]  this is the future this is the world this is why they act like we don't exist
[02:24:21.680 --> 02:24:26.440]  now while we're watching football and acting cool the elite know what the real
[02:24:26.440 --> 02:24:31.040]  discoveries are just what we know is incredible that that's not secret how
[02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:37.040]  advanced dr. group do you really think all this is well then I know for a fact
[02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:44.000]  that they've been able to use up to 50% human DNA right now that has been
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:49.320]  documented there's a transgenic facility at Arizona State University there's a
[02:24:49.320 --> 02:24:55.000]  transgenic transhumanism organization at Stanford University I think they're
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:58.800]  highly advanced and I think a lot of the testing is underground when you look at
[02:24:58.800 --> 02:25:06.280]  all of the black ops testing and genetic stuff most of it I think is
[02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:11.520]  underground my dad was one of the first dentists to do implants in the early
[02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:16.400]  80s and it wasn't just him a bunch of the dentists he knew that were you know
[02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:21.120]  doing implants they tried to hire him to take him to Maryland to an quote
[02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:25.160]  underground operation he had been paid like double what he was making then I
[02:25:25.160 --> 02:25:27.720]  remember the discussions around the table he couldn't tell my mom cuz some of
[02:25:27.720 --> 02:25:30.800]  it was secret and he won't even tell me something about it today cuz you know
[02:25:30.800 --> 02:25:35.760]  obviously he signed stuff but just to discuss it and it was ciphers cyborgs it
[02:25:35.760 --> 02:25:38.680]  was cybernetics and imagine if they were he would they were trying to hire a
[02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:43.040]  bunch of dentist in Dallas and in oral surgeons can you imagine how big these
[02:25:43.040 --> 02:25:49.560]  projects are even like 1982 83 this was going on imagine how big it is now Dr.
[02:25:49.560 --> 02:25:57.360]  Group there's nothing bigger right now with taking the most funding from our
[02:25:57.360 --> 02:26:01.760]  taxpayer dollars believe it or not because Obama is the one that overturned
[02:26:01.760 --> 02:26:07.280]  the restriction that Bush had signed the taxpayer money couldn't be used to
[02:26:07.280 --> 02:26:14.160]  fund stuff like stem cell research and transhumanism and gene transgenic
[02:26:14.160 --> 02:26:20.440]  operations so thanks to Obama now are a good percentage of our taxpayer money is
[02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:26.000]  going to these organizations and that's not even including the black up private
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:30.280]  funded operations I mean we are in a race with China right now and with
[02:26:30.280 --> 02:26:35.800]  Russian there's no stopping it I it's it's crazy to think that I mean they're
[02:26:35.800 --> 02:26:43.560]  merging the vision of wolves into humans for performance warfighters in DARPA
[02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:47.480]  even they took their information down but they had it on their site talking
[02:26:47.480 --> 02:26:52.400]  about investing billions into extended performance warfighters and that's been
[02:26:52.400 --> 02:27:00.080]  going on like you said since you know the early 2000s even back to 1970 so
[02:27:00.080 --> 02:27:04.680]  that's something that you know we're talking about fertility and we're talking
[02:27:04.680 --> 02:27:08.400]  about hormones but what's really going on there's always something going on
[02:27:08.400 --> 02:27:13.280]  behind the scenes is we're looking at these transgenic humans and now they're
[02:27:13.280 --> 02:27:17.000]  even talking about what to do and how they're going to put kill switches into
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:23.200]  these different types of humanoids and you see you can look online right now
[02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:29.400]  there's a big movement for homo sapien 2.0 or modified humans to where you can
[02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:34.600]  learn learn faster your vision can become better you're becoming mortal you
[02:27:34.600 --> 02:27:39.600]  don't die but here's the problem everything we're given has back doors
[02:27:39.600 --> 02:27:45.640]  and trojan horses and all the tech is making a stupider slower all the studies
[02:27:45.640 --> 02:27:50.920]  show it it's not empowering us what we're being given is enslaving us it's
[02:27:50.920 --> 02:27:56.520]  enslaving us it's how to control us and it's taking away it's it's you're
[02:27:56.520 --> 02:28:03.040]  creating something by man instead of what was given to you by God and the same
[02:28:03.040 --> 02:28:06.640]  things happening in the agricultural with genetically modified organisms and
[02:28:06.640 --> 02:28:15.520]  basically we're taking a soul a human soul and we're bringing in man-made
[02:28:15.520 --> 02:28:23.120]  science and man is starting to create different types of genetically modified
[02:28:23.120 --> 02:28:30.760]  plants and genetically modified humans and where this is going is not going to
[02:28:30.760 --> 02:28:34.040]  be good well we know exactly where it's going there they've already introduced
[02:28:34.040 --> 02:28:39.680]  chemicals viruses into the food chain and the water supply and the vaccines to
[02:28:39.680 --> 02:28:43.040]  where soon no one will be able to have children it'll be very very rare the
[02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:47.080]  children of men's scenario but don't worry it won't work with two parents it
[02:28:47.080 --> 02:28:51.760]  works with three parents we will come and design your baby for you now but of
[02:28:51.760 --> 02:28:54.760]  course it will have all the kill switches built into it it's like all the new
[02:28:54.760 --> 02:28:59.080]  cars repo men are going out of business because the cars all just have kill
[02:28:59.080 --> 02:29:02.400]  switches on them and even after you pay off your car the kill switch is still
[02:29:02.400 --> 02:29:07.520]  there now the cops just get your license number and they just issue a code from
[02:29:07.520 --> 02:29:11.400]  a helicopter and your car stops and people say oh that's great that keeps
[02:29:11.400 --> 02:29:17.000]  us safe no we're having this electronic skin these tentacles wire into
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:24.600]  everything for this takeover and and this is the most incredible time ever to
[02:29:24.600 --> 02:29:30.320]  be alive folks because here is the final equation the people running with
[02:29:30.320 --> 02:29:35.320]  show think we're a scourge say we're ugly and want to wipe everybody out
[02:29:35.320 --> 02:29:40.840]  except themselves you're living in a science fiction movie so am I it's real
[02:29:40.840 --> 02:29:44.960]  it's happening we're here raising the alarm for the new renaissance against
[02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:49.280]  the new dark age we'll be back with dr. group on all shows we're on the march
[02:29:49.280 --> 02:30:00.600]  the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network yet another land
[02:30:00.600 --> 02:30:05.240]  grab the BLM the Bureau of Land Management is ignoring the real estate
[02:30:05.240 --> 02:30:09.760]  title given by the state of Texas 74 years ago to a farmer now the same
[02:30:09.760 --> 02:30:13.160]  bureaucracy that has ignored property rights for ranchers like Cliven Bundy
[02:30:13.160 --> 02:30:16.800]  and Nevada ignored property rights for minors in Oregon and elsewhere is
[02:30:16.800 --> 02:30:20.880]  coming after the property of a Texas farmer the BLM has decided they will
[02:30:20.880 --> 02:30:25.120]  move the boundary take half his land and his house Congress has allowed
[02:30:25.120 --> 02:30:29.360]  bureaucracies to grow unchecked because Congress doesn't like to pass laws they
[02:30:29.360 --> 02:30:33.120]  have abdicated their constitutional duty to bureaucracies who not only write
[02:30:33.120 --> 02:30:37.080]  the law but often act as their own police force and run their own court no
[02:30:37.080 --> 02:30:41.480]  one in either party in Washington wants to change it these bureaucracies will
[02:30:41.480 --> 02:30:45.560]  destroy every last remnant of your God given constitutionally protected rights

[02:33:33.760 --> 02:33:38.400]  friend of mine Patriot former Army Special Operations the dad famous chemist
[02:33:38.400 --> 02:33:42.080]  helped develop bisphenol a and the rest of it I've got all the mainstream
[02:33:42.080 --> 02:33:46.160]  articles here admitting what group and others said you know 15 20 years ago that
[02:33:46.160 --> 02:33:50.080]  it was bisphenol a and chemicals that are killing the sperm the fluoride
[02:33:50.080 --> 02:33:54.840]  women's infertility is off the chart and Dr. group I want to go over some of
[02:33:54.840 --> 02:33:58.480]  things that we know do boost fertility and men and women there's some of the
[02:33:58.480 --> 02:34:03.200]  basic things but I'm not saying this because we sell probably what's one of
[02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:07.840]  the best pure iodine's out there I mean we know it's the purest we can find the
[02:34:07.840 --> 02:34:11.400]  person anybody's got that we know of we get even pure if we could the survival
[02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:18.560]  shield x2 but just from my own research and of course your research you die
[02:34:18.560 --> 02:34:22.120]  without iodine but in the government used to say put it in the salt since the
[02:34:22.120 --> 02:34:25.480]  70s it's been out that was even a crude form it's hard for the body to absorb but
[02:34:25.480 --> 02:34:33.840]  better than nothing how does iodine come in for fertility well iodine is
[02:34:33.840 --> 02:34:38.160]  extremely important for fertility it's probably one of the first and foremost
[02:34:38.160 --> 02:34:42.520]  things because it's balancing out the endocrine system when you look at the
[02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:47.960]  endocrine system which contains multiple glands and really the endocrine system
[02:34:47.960 --> 02:34:53.000]  is nothing more than glands that produce and regulate hormone secretions and
[02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:58.440]  whenever you have hormone balance you're in health whenever your hormones are out
[02:34:58.440 --> 02:35:04.520]  of whack you're going to be suffering from fatigue pains everywhere infertility
[02:35:04.520 --> 02:35:09.960]  sterility I mean you could probably link practically every single disease
[02:35:09.960 --> 02:35:16.040]  mechanism to a hormone imbalance but iodine is one of the one of the
[02:35:16.040 --> 02:35:20.120]  substances that's missing in practically everybody we there's been massive
[02:35:20.120 --> 02:35:27.200]  studies that show iodine deficiency linked to infertility brain health lower
[02:35:27.200 --> 02:35:33.600]  IQ and not only that it's an endocrine system balancer so what iodine does is
[02:35:33.600 --> 02:35:38.120]  help balance out your endocrine system which is all your glands including your
[02:35:38.120 --> 02:35:42.040]  gut which is the number one endocrine gland in the body the biggest and
[02:35:42.040 --> 02:35:48.160]  largest and it helps not only balance out and in iodine is also by the way
[02:35:48.160 --> 02:35:55.760]  necessary for hormone production but it also helps detoxify the other toxic
[02:35:55.760 --> 02:36:00.120]  halogens like fluoride and chlorine and bromine from the body so I mean I cannot
[02:36:00.120 --> 02:36:04.200]  tell people I mean people can either have used m4slife.com just getting off
[02:36:04.200 --> 02:36:09.520]  this for a moment I cannot tell people because I remember growing up and
[02:36:09.520 --> 02:36:13.640]  seeing like health nut hippies master swimmers people I knew my mom's friends
[02:36:13.640 --> 02:36:17.160]  and I'd see like a jug of water with a little bit of pink in it and I'd say
[02:36:17.160 --> 02:36:20.760]  what's that and they were just putting raw you know cruddy iodine and these
[02:36:20.760 --> 02:36:24.280]  people look great they're like iodine man you got to have it so I know the
[02:36:24.280 --> 02:36:31.320]  hippies always knew this or you know kind of the health nuts but it's just so
[02:36:31.320 --> 02:36:35.320]  incredible that you said watch out you may have a you know detoxifying event
[02:36:35.320 --> 02:36:38.320]  within three to four weeks about three weeks later I felt crappy for about five
[02:36:38.320 --> 02:36:42.240]  days and then I don't want to get gross but all this stuff was coming out of my
[02:36:42.240 --> 02:36:48.160]  skin other things why was it doing that dr. group from your research well from
[02:36:48.160 --> 02:36:52.680]  our research it pulls out the toxic halogens like bromine chlorine and
[02:36:52.680 --> 02:36:58.040]  fluorine and so you feel bad a few weeks in you start sloughing it well not
[02:36:58.040 --> 02:37:01.960]  only that there it'll also start pulling out some of the other chemicals and
[02:37:01.960 --> 02:37:05.640]  toxins and it'll start pulling it out from the thyroid and all the other cells
[02:37:05.640 --> 02:37:10.240]  in the body and especially if you have you know back then you were also 40 pounds
[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:15.880]  heavier so when you're because iodine is absorbed by all the fat cells and fat
[02:37:15.880 --> 02:37:19.840]  cells actually store toxins whether it's phthalates I mean we could list a
[02:37:19.840 --> 02:37:24.520]  million toxins but everybody's different you might have more phthalates stored or
[02:37:24.520 --> 02:37:29.040]  somebody else might have more phytoestrogens or xenoestrogens or
[02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:33.840]  something like that or pesticides insecticides herbicides it just depends
[02:37:33.840 --> 02:37:37.560]  on and when you start pulling out all those chemicals and toxins from all the
[02:37:37.560 --> 02:37:41.640]  cells then they go back into your bloodstream and that causes a herxima
[02:37:41.640 --> 02:37:46.200]  reaction and then you can be have headaches you could be more fatigued for
[02:37:46.200 --> 02:37:50.400]  a few days and that's why we recommend drinking a lot of water usually people
[02:37:50.400 --> 02:37:57.160]  that are a little bit overweight the heavier you are the more chances are
[02:37:57.160 --> 02:38:01.640]  that you're going to experience a herxima reaction and let's be clear
[02:38:01.640 --> 02:38:04.760]  everybody's different if somebody's thyroid is already really screwed up
[02:38:04.760 --> 02:38:08.440]  already having problems and you push this and it starts pushing out bad
[02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:12.360]  halogens that had it filled that you might something bad might happen I mean
[02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:15.440]  people really should talk to their physician before taking x2 shouldn't
[02:38:15.440 --> 02:38:20.080]  they Dr. Group yeah they should no doubt about it but that's also why talking
[02:38:20.080 --> 02:38:24.400]  about infertility and one of the main causes for women actually is is
[02:38:24.400 --> 02:38:31.080]  polycystic ovarian and cysts everywhere and we know that the accumulation of
[02:38:31.080 --> 02:38:35.200]  cysts whether it's in men or women it's epidemic women almost every woman I
[02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:38.240]  know is getting cysts even at young ages on their ovaries you name it what's
[02:38:38.240 --> 02:38:42.200]  going on and thyroid to people are being diagnosed with thyroid cysts and
[02:38:42.200 --> 02:38:46.920]  everybody's being diagnosed with hyper hypo or Hashimoto's thyroid
[02:38:46.920 --> 02:38:52.040]  disorders and that's all linked specifically to an iodine deficiency and
[02:38:52.040 --> 02:38:57.920]  I'm not you know one that promotes you being on 30 40 different supplements
[02:38:57.920 --> 02:39:03.800]  every single day but iodine there's no doubt that children and adults in my
[02:39:03.800 --> 02:39:07.440]  opinion like you said talk to your natural or your health care practitioner
[02:39:07.440 --> 02:39:11.840]  but that's something that you're just not going to get in your and let's
[02:39:11.840 --> 02:39:15.880]  explain if you don't have iodine your body will absorb the bad halogens to
[02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:20.200]  run and operate and then that's when this stuff starts up I mean when you the
[02:39:20.200 --> 02:39:24.080]  bromide the bromine the chlorine the fluoride that's in the same family that's
[02:39:24.080 --> 02:39:30.560]  what goes in there that's right and iodine is actually toxic in itself when
[02:39:30.560 --> 02:39:35.360]  it comes from the earth we have to take it through a detoxification process to
[02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:41.400]  where it's already broken down into the iodine that's naturally broken down and
[02:39:41.400 --> 02:39:45.920]  let's say plants like kelp so that's why ours turns purple and all the other
[02:39:45.920 --> 02:39:50.520]  dark blue on paper others turn red because what it's still bound or explain
[02:39:50.520 --> 02:39:57.360]  that to me well it's in a mono atomic state basically it's iodine in its
[02:39:57.360 --> 02:40:01.440]  natural crystalline form if you take it from the earth it's going to gas out and
[02:40:01.440 --> 02:40:05.400]  if you breathe that gas in it can it can be toxic to you it can burn the tissues
[02:40:05.400 --> 02:40:10.440]  and and work as an oxidant so what we do is we use a proprietary technique to
[02:40:10.440 --> 02:40:16.120]  where we almost simulate it going through the processes in the body to where we
[02:40:16.120 --> 02:40:22.080]  it has a negative charge on it to where it's a monatomic form of iodine exactly
[02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:27.640]  what would happen if it was broken down in your liver that's also another reason
[02:40:27.640 --> 02:40:31.640]  why we recommend doing liver cleansing and then also doing intestinal cleansing
[02:40:31.640 --> 02:40:35.520]  as well to get everything working properly in your body so your body can
[02:40:35.520 --> 02:40:41.040]  actually eliminate the chemicals and toxins that you're pulling out of the
[02:40:41.040 --> 02:40:46.500]  tissues properly well I just wish I'd known all this earlier it is a game
[02:40:46.500 --> 02:40:49.520]  changer to know my hormones have been manipulated by the globalist through the
[02:40:49.520 --> 02:40:53.080]  food the water the rest of it and that there are these natural compounds I want
[02:40:53.080 --> 02:40:56.560]  to go to some phone calls across the board a bunch of different issues political
[02:40:56.560 --> 02:41:00.920]  you name it but but doctor group also what are some of the other game
[02:41:00.920 --> 02:41:06.160]  changers that people aren't aware of for male and female fertility I mean what
[02:41:06.160 --> 02:41:11.440]  can males do with an 87 90% sperm drop across the Western world because of our
[02:41:11.440 --> 02:41:15.720]  loving friends the New World Order is there any way to counter that yes there
[02:41:15.720 --> 02:41:19.360]  is I mean it's balancing your hormones naturally and the first thing you want
[02:41:19.360 --> 02:41:24.480]  to do is try to avoid as many of the harmful hormone disrupting chemicals
[02:41:24.480 --> 02:41:28.200]  and endocrine disrupting chemicals out there which are going to be your
[02:41:28.200 --> 02:41:31.680]  fluoride your vaccine so don't get TV dinners and put them in the microwave
[02:41:31.680 --> 02:41:34.960]  which heats up the Bisfree and all a and basically gives you a sterile it
[02:41:34.960 --> 02:41:41.200]  does yeah but I tell you one and that's the reason why I develop and you

[02:41:55.760 --> 02:42:00.240]  things that restrict hormones and how hormones get out of balance and you can
[02:42:00.240 --> 02:42:06.920]  eliminate those things but especially with males males are really affected
[02:42:06.920 --> 02:42:11.760]  these days 50% of the infertility problems have to do with males these
[02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:17.520]  days and so it's not just the females like we thought years ago so now that's
[02:42:17.520 --> 02:42:23.840]  why we came out with you exclusive unique formulas that we can balance or
[02:42:23.840 --> 02:42:32.160]  help the body naturally balance the hormone levels to increase the body's

[02:42:58.480 --> 02:43:04.560]  the other things that we've talked about so what it's not if you have a hormone
[02:43:04.560 --> 02:43:10.200]  imbalance or not 10 out of 10 people right now over the age of 28 have
[02:43:10.200 --> 02:43:15.200]  hormone imbalance the horn that's why the adrenal glands get affected that's
[02:43:15.200 --> 02:43:19.120]  why people are having thyroid problems that's why people are having mood
[02:43:19.120 --> 02:43:22.920]  swings that's why you have so many people suffering from depression and
[02:43:22.920 --> 02:43:27.760]  because modern society is so unnatural so toxic right and if you have a
[02:43:27.760 --> 02:43:32.480]  solution for that by cleansing the body cleansing the liver utilizing those

[02:44:49.480 --> 02:44:54.480]  doesn't matter there's a solution or toxins in the air on how you can purify
[02:44:54.480 --> 02:44:59.120]  your own air but once you reduce the amount of chemicals and toxins coming
[02:44:59.120 --> 02:45:04.080]  into your body on a regular basis then your body self-healing mechanism can
[02:45:04.080 --> 02:45:08.600]  activate again and it's something especially with a super male and super
[02:45:08.600 --> 02:45:16.000]  female vitality that I take my wife takes the older we get and nowadays you
[02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:21.240]  have women and men that wanted to wait till they were 35 or 40 years old before
[02:45:21.240 --> 02:45:25.240]  they have a child and they're running into the situation where the males
[02:45:25.240 --> 02:45:31.640]  hormones are decreased the woman's has high estrogen content and low progesterone
[02:45:31.640 --> 02:45:35.960]  and their hormones are out of balance the woman is suffering from ovarian
[02:45:35.960 --> 02:45:42.440]  cyst or polycystic ovary disease and what is modern medicine doing for that
[02:45:42.440 --> 02:45:46.480]  they're obviously not telling them that they need to clean their body and
[02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:51.120]  besides that wouldn't you want to have a clean healthy body before you want to
[02:45:51.120 --> 02:45:55.640]  concede well yeah I mean people ought to at least try it I mean that's what I'm

[02:46:44.080 --> 02:46:48.160]  ISIS targets and now already driving them out of many areas turning the ISIS
[02:46:48.160 --> 02:46:52.840]  Saudi Arabian Western back defensive Russia's tried to come to the US to have
[02:46:52.840 --> 02:46:57.520]  meetings with the Defense Department about coordinated strikes they're trying
[02:46:57.520 --> 02:47:01.160]  to meet with US diplomats this only happens for folks that don't know at
[02:47:01.160 --> 02:47:06.160]  the beginning of World War two the Japanese stop seeing their diplomatic
[02:47:06.160 --> 02:47:10.960]  counterparts two days before Pearl Harbor so it's unprecedented that
[02:47:10.960 --> 02:47:18.480]  diplomatic connections even in the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1961 1962 we're
[02:47:18.480 --> 02:47:23.120]  going on diplomatic connections have now been severed Russia's been kicked out of
[02:47:23.120 --> 02:47:27.640]  the G8 I don't think for another audience is very smart but for the general
[02:47:27.640 --> 02:47:32.560]  public I don't think they realize doctor group this is unprecedented well
[02:47:32.560 --> 02:47:36.080]  there's no doubt about that we've been talking about all the events that have
[02:47:36.080 --> 02:47:40.360]  been happening and it's just a hundred fold it seems like since let's say
[02:47:40.360 --> 02:47:47.240]  July of this year I mean coming into August September October we can feel it
[02:47:47.240 --> 02:47:51.920]  we talked about it the dread yeah right it's just an accumulation of
[02:47:51.920 --> 02:47:56.080]  everything it's not you know I I'm not the type of guy I meditate every single
[02:47:56.080 --> 02:48:00.760]  day that has anxiety but I've been feeling just this anxiety just coming
[02:48:00.760 --> 02:48:04.840]  over me and it's so strange because usually I keep myself pretty calm all
[02:48:04.840 --> 02:48:09.200]  these things that are happening in Russia and all over the world it's creating
[02:48:09.200 --> 02:48:15.960]  an extreme amount of fear and anxiety I mean when that's all that people you know
[02:48:15.960 --> 02:48:21.760]  you got a still 90% of the world's population watches mainstream media
[02:48:21.760 --> 02:48:26.520]  hopefully it's less than that by now but you can almost look at people walking
[02:48:26.520 --> 02:48:31.280]  around and tell you just suck in their anxiety or something I'll try to like
[02:48:31.280 --> 02:48:36.160]  put a force field around myself or something because it's crazy it's just
[02:48:36.160 --> 02:48:41.160]  this so incredibly unconscious and stupid so they're just being fed
[02:48:41.160 --> 02:48:45.760]  everything to their subconscious they have no shield and and you're also
[02:48:45.760 --> 02:48:49.480]  picking up the fact that the public's turning evil not everybody folks are
[02:48:49.480 --> 02:48:52.560]  getting better they're getting worse I don't think there's an in-between now but
[02:48:52.560 --> 02:48:55.920]  people are also just buying into the spirit of the world people are hating
[02:48:55.920 --> 02:49:01.360]  each other and it's just very wicked it's being programmed so we don't stand up
[02:49:01.360 --> 02:49:02.920]  for each other when they pull the switch
[02:49:02.920 --> 02:49:07.120]  Simon in Florida on the Russian Ministry briefing this morning Simon go ahead

[02:50:06.400 --> 02:50:10.200]  was the YouTube one was attack on Russian embassy in Syria a result of

[02:55:12.720 --> 02:55:16.320]  know that we get that I could say that there is such thing as political
[02:55:16.320 --> 02:55:23.480]  correctness right now you know what I'm trying to do and what I've been focusing
[02:55:23.480 --> 02:55:27.520]  on is not really paying too much attention to what's going on there and
[02:55:27.520 --> 02:55:31.880]  trying to help as many people as I can with the stress that they're under I

[02:57:42.800 --> 02:57:49.160]  going up their rent goes up their food and and all that but you know they don't
[02:57:49.160 --> 02:57:53.000]  deserve a raise because gas is down that's not fair to the old people

[02:59:50.040 --> 02:59:55.520]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[03:00:00.880 --> 03:00:06.680]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[03:00:06.680 --> 03:00:13.200]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[03:00:14.680 --> 03:00:20.600]  highly respected NSA whistleblower journalist John Schindler a security
[03:00:20.600 --> 03:00:27.880]  expert who now writes the Daily Beast says that a senior EU official said
[03:00:27.880 --> 03:00:32.680]  that governments across the board believe that Obama is mentally ill and
[03:00:32.680 --> 03:00:38.480]  then gets into why they believe that and I've heard that from a lot of
[03:00:38.480 --> 03:00:43.280]  insiders that Obama is completely delusional thinks he's God thinks he's
[03:00:43.280 --> 03:00:51.600]  invincible all I know is it's really evil to take radical Muslims and inject
[03:00:51.600 --> 03:00:54.880]  them into non-radical areas to kill everybody and then protect them and then
[03:00:54.880 --> 03:00:59.480]  give them everything free and I just wonder where this is all going I mean
[03:00:59.480 --> 03:01:03.960]  the economy's unraveling just like our experts said it would by now there's
[03:01:03.960 --> 03:01:07.560]  all these preparations going on for tyranny there's all these attacks on
[03:01:07.560 --> 03:01:12.360]  free speech I think the system's doing this talk to the group because they
[03:01:12.360 --> 03:01:16.080]  know they've lost the confidence of the people they know there's a major
[03:01:16.080 --> 03:01:22.000]  backlash against them forming worldwide and the numbers show that what does
[03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:28.000]  your intellect or gut tell you my gut tells me that people are waking up and
[03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:32.320]  they're not believing as much the mainstream media and we have more and
[03:01:32.320 --> 03:01:39.880]  more people every single day that are just you know realizing and starting to
[03:01:39.880 --> 03:01:45.000]  understand more truth out there as people become healthy as people detoxify
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:50.200]  their body they start opening up and they start their consciousness rises and
[03:01:50.200 --> 03:01:55.960]  we're seeing this mass consciousness come into effect right now and you know
[03:01:55.960 --> 03:02:00.200]  they're sick and tired of hearing all the lies and reading about all the lies and
[03:02:00.200 --> 03:02:04.760]  the government and all a lot of these you know secret organizations and
[03:02:04.760 --> 03:02:11.560]  everything are starting to become exposed now and you know with time you're I
[03:02:11.560 --> 03:02:16.640]  think that we are seeing a progression of good at the same time so it's not all
[03:02:16.640 --> 03:02:23.520]  negative I know a lot of there's a lot of people out there that are you know
[03:02:23.520 --> 03:02:28.960]  really fighting to educate the masses as to the truth so I mean I do see some
[03:02:28.960 --> 03:02:33.440]  positive in all of it all I know is a lot of people say this is an incredibly
[03:02:33.440 --> 03:02:36.600]  boring time the more TV you watch the more you're into mainstream media these
[03:02:36.600 --> 03:02:41.040]  people are so unhappy all the big studies show it I am incredibly fulfilled
[03:02:41.040 --> 03:02:46.920]  my life is just like unbelievably exciting and cool and scary and dangerous
[03:02:46.920 --> 03:02:55.000]  and vivid and I just can't imagine all these timid souls that live in their
[03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:59.040]  rooms watching television I mean I can't watch more than like 30 minutes of TV a
[03:02:59.040 --> 03:03:04.040]  day I can go see movies and stuff I I mean I just it's just such a bombarding
[03:03:04.040 --> 03:03:07.800]  garbage you know I want to go to all these calls and so sometimes I segue in
[03:03:07.800 --> 03:03:11.680]  with the guest host in the fourth hour I'm gonna go to 20 after with Leanne
[03:03:11.680 --> 03:03:16.240]  McAdoo and Dr. Group if you can do it Dr. Group so we can talk to Rich Dante
[03:03:16.240 --> 03:03:19.240]  Mike Brandon and Steve and then we'll throw everything to Leanne she's got a
[03:03:19.240 --> 03:03:22.320]  bunch of news coming up and it's gonna be breaking down more of the Democrat
[03:03:22.320 --> 03:03:28.320]  debate but Obama bemoans Dr. Group that people don't trust the government anymore
[03:03:28.320 --> 03:03:31.680]  and you're gonna make things collapse if you don't trust us well if the
[03:03:31.680 --> 03:03:35.200]  government's run by globalists that want to collapse things to control us in
[03:03:35.200 --> 03:03:40.400]  their own words if it's illegitimate isn't it our duty to not trust them and
[03:03:40.400 --> 03:03:45.120]  go along with them I mean that's common sense so so I really see their
[03:03:45.120 --> 03:03:51.440]  desperation Dr. Group I think we're coming to that tipping point right I
[03:03:51.440 --> 03:03:55.880]  agree I think we're coming to that tipping point too it's it's like a last-ditch
[03:03:55.880 --> 03:04:02.840]  effort that the globalists are pulling out right now and you know I hope and I
[03:04:02.840 --> 03:04:06.960]  pray that we're coming into the next golden age it's it's gonna be a rough
[03:04:06.960 --> 03:04:14.280]  ride but you definitely do see progress you know people have woken up about the
[03:04:14.280 --> 03:04:18.240]  genetically modified organisms I mean we people are fighting against fluoride
[03:04:18.240 --> 03:04:23.160]  in the system people are standing up and trying to be more they're taking the
[03:04:23.160 --> 03:04:26.200]  fluoride out they're cutting it they have they admit we're right they admit
[03:04:26.200 --> 03:04:29.880]  9-11 was an inside job now and then our government stood down bare minimum
[03:04:29.880 --> 03:04:34.560]  we're right again Dr. Group yeah people are realizing that the government has
[03:04:34.560 --> 03:04:39.880]  been up to a lot of shady things over the last hundred years and so they're
[03:04:39.880 --> 03:04:42.480]  they're starting to wake up which is great I mean that's been the whole
[03:04:42.480 --> 03:04:46.000]  mission to wake everybody up wake them up you know I've been focusing on
[03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:49.280]  waking people up to the health care and the diversion sure and they know we're
[03:04:49.280 --> 03:04:52.320]  waking up so they want to start having everybody kill cops start a civil war so
[03:04:52.320 --> 03:04:55.400]  we all kill each other like morons and the answer is we're not gonna do we're
[03:04:55.400 --> 03:05:02.800]  not gonna repeat 1860s and yet another land grab the BLM the Bureau of Land
[03:05:02.800 --> 03:05:07.320]  Management is ignoring the real estate title given by the state of Texas 74
[03:05:07.320 --> 03:05:11.360]  years ago to a farmer now the same bureaucracy that has ignored property
[03:05:11.360 --> 03:05:14.880]  rights for ranchers like Clive and Bundy in Nevada ignored property rights for
[03:05:14.880 --> 03:05:19.200]  minors in Oregon and elsewhere is coming after the property of a Texas farmer
[03:05:19.200 --> 03:05:23.280]  the BLM has decided they will move the boundary take half his land and his
[03:05:23.280 --> 03:05:27.640]  house Congress has allowed bureaucracies to grow unchecked because Congress
[03:05:27.640 --> 03:05:31.440]  doesn't like to pass laws they have abdicated their constitutional duty to
[03:05:31.440 --> 03:05:35.280]  bureaucracy who not only write the law but often act as their own police force
[03:05:35.280 --> 03:05:39.560]  and run their own court no one in either party in Washington wants to change it
[03:05:39.560 --> 03:05:43.880]  these bureaucracies will destroy every last remnant of your God given
[03:05:43.880 --> 03:05:47.840]  constitutionally protected rights including your property rights unless
[03:05:47.840 --> 03:05:54.680]  they are stopped by you by the people at the state and the local level for more

[03:07:12.120 --> 03:07:15.520]  has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years the federal government
[03:07:15.520 --> 03:07:20.160]  mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine accrued form of it be added to
[03:07:20.160 --> 03:07:24.160]  table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency

[03:08:24.640 --> 03:08:29.200]  texas and so this is a big fourth hour lined up I want to do one more segment
[03:08:29.200 --> 03:08:33.760]  to go to rich gante mike brandon and steve real quick but leon macadoo and
[03:08:33.760 --> 03:08:37.120]  david night I want to get into some of the topics you're going to be covering
[03:08:37.120 --> 03:08:42.400]  in the shower after this segment but also some of the news where there are 15
[03:08:42.400 --> 03:08:46.840]  people arrested for terrorism for driving around with rebel flags secretive
[03:08:46.840 --> 03:08:51.640]  un legal conference wants to outlaw climate change denial I mean this is
[03:08:51.640 --> 03:08:55.680]  getting really totalitarian they're arresting Germans that criticize open
[03:08:55.680 --> 03:08:59.760]  borders it looks like the totalitarians are moving into high gear leon macadoo
[03:08:59.760 --> 03:09:04.000]  david night your take on that well and they're openly now talking about how
[03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:08.000]  they're going to be censoring people arresting people I mean you can't do
[03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:14.440]  anything you can't have an opinion that is intolerable to the minority actually
[03:09:14.440 --> 03:09:19.600]  it's the minority now ruling over everyone tyrannically you called it you
[03:09:19.600 --> 03:09:22.360]  know Alex one of the things we're going to talk about is this story that was
[03:09:22.360 --> 03:09:25.600]  covered by grudge yesterday that a dime sell is our dead the Texas rancher
[03:09:25.600 --> 03:09:29.200]  fighting back against BLM land grabs this is something that they've been
[03:09:29.200 --> 03:09:33.520]  working at for a while they've moved the boundaries in the Red River Valley area
[03:09:33.520 --> 03:09:37.760]  this is exactly what's happening they're moving the boundaries on all of our
[03:09:37.760 --> 03:09:41.040]  rights we have to understand that our civil liberties as well as our property
[03:09:41.040 --> 03:09:45.080]  rights those are all property of ours and so when they take our they're
[03:09:45.080 --> 03:09:48.720]  claiming hundreds and sometimes thousands of yards on every side of rivers
[03:09:48.720 --> 03:09:53.040]  and creeks nationwide yes and they're starting with Texas and Oklahoma just
[03:09:53.040 --> 03:09:57.680]  grabbing hundreds of thousands of acres with people's land that have fences
[03:09:57.680 --> 03:10:01.400]  they've owned for over a hundred years it's unprecedented and it's not just a
[03:10:01.400 --> 03:10:04.600]  BLM of course we're going to talk about the fact that it's the EPA as well the
[03:10:04.600 --> 03:10:09.440]  IRS is operate this way right all of the government operates essentially as
[03:10:09.440 --> 03:10:12.800]  blackmailing and thievery this is something that started with the war on
[03:10:12.800 --> 03:10:16.680]  drugs that is metastasized to all these different agencies they no longer
[03:10:16.680 --> 03:10:20.320]  respect the rule of law they no longer respect property they don't respect our
[03:10:20.320 --> 03:10:24.280]  rights and this is a very serious situation the bureaucracies are out of
[03:10:24.280 --> 03:10:27.800]  control that's right it's a power grab I mean everything Leanne do you think
[03:10:27.800 --> 03:10:31.160]  they're accelerating everything because they're behind schedule or because they
[03:10:31.160 --> 03:10:34.760]  just don't care anymore or they want to start a civil war I mean it's just on
[03:10:34.760 --> 03:10:38.520]  every front it is just they're arming to the teeth they're training to fight us
[03:10:38.520 --> 03:10:42.360]  they're saying we're the enemy but the paradox is it's woken up the military
[03:10:42.360 --> 03:10:47.720]  and police because they now know the patriots like Ron Paul and ourselves and
[03:10:47.720 --> 03:10:51.720]  many others were right about this warning about it right well and obviously
[03:10:51.720 --> 03:10:56.600]  the internet had a big deal and helping to wake people up you can get instant
[03:10:56.600 --> 03:10:59.880]  access to information it's a lot harder for them to hide the things that they're
[03:10:59.880 --> 03:11:03.640]  doing you know obviously with the Clive and Bundy thing I mean that just took
[03:11:03.640 --> 03:11:09.200]  off when people saw the blatant disregard for constitutional rights so
[03:11:09.200 --> 03:11:12.720]  so many people were able to rally around that where without the internet they
[03:11:12.720 --> 03:11:16.040]  might never have even known this was going on so I think that's one of the
[03:11:16.040 --> 03:11:20.800]  reasons why they're really accelerating this having to kind of move their plans
[03:11:20.800 --> 03:11:25.040]  a little bit forward but it's interesting that they have a democratic
[03:11:25.040 --> 03:11:31.720]  socialist as a serious contender for the presidency basically saying you don't
[03:11:31.720 --> 03:11:34.920]  need property you don't need these rights the government will take care of
[03:11:34.920 --> 03:11:37.960]  everything the government's gonna own all that land so don't worry about it
[03:11:37.960 --> 03:11:41.320]  not selling freedom he's selling freebies right that's the difference between
[03:11:41.320 --> 03:11:46.160]  libertarians and socialists it's truly sick though it's so premeditated to have
[03:11:46.160 --> 03:11:51.920]  the robber barons funding all of this and just to see the hopelessness of the
[03:11:51.920 --> 03:11:56.080]  TV heads Dr. Group I want to go to some of these phone calls and all of us can
[03:11:56.080 --> 03:12:00.440]  chime in on these Dante's calling from California he says he disagrees on race
[03:12:00.440 --> 03:12:05.840]  issue I don't know what race issue that was can you tell me Dante specifically
[03:12:05.840 --> 03:12:10.240]  what you disagree with well I want people to have a strong understanding of
[03:12:10.240 --> 03:12:14.640]  their power and their identity and so when I want people to hear what I'm
[03:12:14.640 --> 03:12:18.720]  about to say it's about first you got to tell me what you disagree with sir I
[03:12:18.720 --> 03:12:23.840]  agree with how you're outlook on race I think that you think race exists and I
[03:12:23.840 --> 03:12:28.720]  think it doesn't exist now I think it's wrong to look at race is something that
[03:12:28.720 --> 03:12:32.360]  is a reality consider yourself to be a modern liberal because that's a very
[03:12:32.360 --> 03:12:36.800]  ignorance it's like listen there's a race of hold on a minute there's a race of
[03:12:36.800 --> 03:12:41.360]  canines all dogs wolves are basically the same thing but there's different
[03:12:41.360 --> 03:12:46.000]  there's different variants there's different flavors you know somebody in
[03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:49.480]  North Africa is different somebody in South Africa somebody in the Congo is
[03:12:49.480 --> 03:12:54.360]  ever there's somebody in in you know Libya so it's in of course there's
[03:12:54.360 --> 03:12:58.700]  variants within all of those groups but there is the human race but then there
[03:12:58.700 --> 03:13:03.400]  is different varieties different variants different different things that
[03:13:03.400 --> 03:13:08.600]  are atypical in a group so you just built a total straw man and said that I
[03:13:08.600 --> 03:13:14.120]  believe there are quote races which is not even a statement I made which is
[03:13:14.120 --> 03:13:17.840]  which is I love most time people disagree they just make something up and
[03:13:17.840 --> 03:13:23.480]  then apply it to me and then most people don't even know about politics or you
[03:13:23.480 --> 03:13:27.120]  know spaces spaces or anything they just know about I'm offended because you
[03:13:27.120 --> 03:13:31.400]  don't like my selfie you're a sexist or I mean people's literacy is obsessing
[03:13:31.400 --> 03:13:35.120]  over mindless race issues so I wanted to hear what you disagreed with I'll go
[03:13:35.120 --> 03:13:40.800]  ahead it's not about you Alex Jones it's just about the race issue okay so why
[03:13:40.800 --> 03:13:45.600]  I have a black person my skin color is what is considered black in America I
[03:13:45.600 --> 03:13:50.840]  just like to tell people though that I am not a black person I'm an American and
[03:13:50.840 --> 03:13:54.740]  what makes me so stronger than American is that I know my fellow rights in my
[03:13:54.740 --> 03:13:58.280]  constitution I agree with that you're talking like John Wayne you're not a
[03:13:58.280 --> 03:14:02.840]  hyphenated American no exactly I'm not a hyphenated American I want people to
[03:14:02.840 --> 03:14:06.040]  understand that you can I get away from this identity of being black I know but
[03:14:06.040 --> 03:14:08.840]  we have to address it within the identity politics that's what they've
[03:14:08.840 --> 03:14:14.040]  created I agree with you that there's positive racism a lot of people think
[03:14:14.040 --> 03:14:18.320]  that all racism is bad no there's positive racism when people have that
[03:14:18.320 --> 03:14:22.720]  positive feelings about the color of their skin they attribute it back to
[03:14:22.720 --> 03:14:26.840]  culture sure sure I mean everybody should be proud of themselves Dr. Group
[03:14:26.840 --> 03:14:30.000]  you want to say anything to this I mean the fact that all Americans do is talk
[03:14:30.000 --> 03:14:34.920]  about race we're forced to cover it all day but it just shows the the general
[03:14:34.920 --> 03:14:40.320]  illiteracy we know how to obsess on things that don't matter as the world
[03:14:40.320 --> 03:14:46.760]  is stolen from us by the globalist Dr. Group well I mean I don't I don't look
[03:14:46.760 --> 03:14:52.440]  at race when I when I look at Americans because we are a force I mean if
[03:14:52.440 --> 03:14:57.360]  you're a true American you know we're a force that will continue to shake our
[03:14:57.360 --> 03:15:01.080]  nation right we're under attack because we did have the free market we did have
[03:15:01.080 --> 03:15:04.140]  the guns we were the best they've deliberately turned us into a bunch of
[03:15:04.140 --> 03:15:08.600]  idiots to take us down go ahead Dr. Group I'm just saying it's the American
[03:15:08.600 --> 03:15:12.560]  lawmakers that need to wake up and speak for the citizens that they represent
[03:15:12.560 --> 03:15:18.920]  I mean it's it's almost like who we put in office are you know racist against us
[03:15:18.920 --> 03:15:22.960]  or something it's and and they need to represent us not the corporate giants who
[03:15:22.960 --> 03:15:27.360]  contributed to their campaign so it's you know we the people really I mean
[03:15:27.360 --> 03:15:31.760]  there is no racism and we the people and if we ever come together around our
[03:15:31.760 --> 03:15:35.000]  basic freedoms like this caller said so I apologize caller get your point now
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:38.900]  thank you Dante and we ever get up stand up for each other's rights it's game
[03:15:38.900 --> 03:15:42.120]  over for the globalists that's why they divide and conquer and people say I'm
[03:15:42.120 --> 03:15:45.640]  dividing and conquering when I point out they're shipping millions of radical
[03:15:45.640 --> 03:15:50.280]  islamic sin to give them everything free well I'm not against those people per
[03:15:50.280 --> 03:15:53.840]  say but they're being brought in to create the class of civilization to then
[03:15:53.840 --> 03:15:57.280]  tell Europeans you've got to give your rights up because you're offending the
[03:15:57.280 --> 03:16:01.760]  outsider so I have to oppose the globalist policies because they create
[03:16:01.760 --> 03:16:05.480]  the divide and conquer to control us so we shouldn't allow the climate that
[03:16:05.480 --> 03:16:10.160]  that that makes it easier for them day-to-night Liam McAdoo any comments
[03:16:10.160 --> 03:16:14.040]  on that last caller well Alex I would say that you know the Bible talks about
[03:16:14.040 --> 03:16:17.240]  us all being of one blood to talk about the commonality of the human
[03:16:17.240 --> 03:16:20.320]  experience it does talk about the differences however in terms of nations
[03:16:20.320 --> 03:16:24.120]  tongues and tribes and so we understand that there is a cultural difference we
[03:16:24.120 --> 03:16:27.360]  understand there's a difference in the way people organize themselves and the
[03:16:27.360 --> 03:16:31.320]  way that they view the world that's what the fight is about but you know we let
[03:16:31.320 --> 03:16:38.320]  the left rule us by using semantics and that's a tool of control and I think we
[03:16:38.320 --> 03:16:43.440]  need to pull back and look at how they use language and we saw a lot of that
[03:16:43.440 --> 03:16:47.760]  last night that was in abundance the way they used language to put out different
[03:16:47.760 --> 03:16:52.880]  ideas to talk about how we were going to get the get the money out of politics
[03:16:52.880 --> 03:16:56.800]  well you know what we need to get the politics out of money the the socialists
[03:16:56.800 --> 03:17:00.240]  like Bernie Sanders are never going to talk about the Federal Reserve because
[03:17:00.240 --> 03:17:04.600]  that's given them a lot of smoke and mirrors that's given them fantasy money
[03:17:04.600 --> 03:17:07.120]  that they can use to run these entitlement programs and of course
[03:17:07.120 --> 03:17:10.240]  Republicans don't want to do it either because they have a massive military
[03:17:10.240 --> 03:17:14.000]  empire that they want to run with that same fantasy money so they want to talk
[03:17:14.000 --> 03:17:16.680]  about Wall Street but they don't want to talk about the real core issue which is
[03:17:16.680 --> 03:17:20.240]  the Federal Reserve that's the way they use semantics that's the way they don't
[03:17:20.240 --> 03:17:23.840]  talk about the class envy of select banking families getting free trillions
[03:17:23.840 --> 03:17:26.920]  that we have to back up that's right they just all day get mad because your
[03:17:26.920 --> 03:17:30.040]  neighbors got a better car than them Leigh Ann well don't forget Hillary
[03:17:30.040 --> 03:17:34.640]  Clinton said she marched down to Wall Street and told him to cut it out so
[03:17:34.640 --> 03:17:38.800]  that's how she's gonna have a talk to us like we're five yeah I mean that's how
[03:17:38.800 --> 03:17:41.760]  she's gonna handle Wall Street make me come down there Leigh Ann can you put
[03:17:41.760 --> 03:17:46.240]  your hands on your hips like the stage deal of a jeb bushes operative and like
[03:17:46.240 --> 03:17:52.840]  look at Donald Trump angry I think you're against woman yes like I've got
[03:17:52.840 --> 03:17:56.080]  makeup on my hair is done no no but put your hands on your sides come on like
[03:17:56.080 --> 03:18:01.400]  you're a wonder woman wonder woman the whole world is waiting for you and the
[03:18:01.400 --> 03:18:08.840]  power I'm just not that angry you know Leigh Ann is Wonder Woman can we come in

[03:24:36.520 --> 03:24:41.720]  overdrive contrary to that intro music it is not Wonder Woman it is Leanne
[03:24:41.720 --> 03:24:47.320]  Macadoo I am also joined here with David Knight and we were just during the break
[03:24:47.320 --> 03:24:53.600]  we were talking about the absolute ludicrousness that is the EPA they are
[03:24:53.600 --> 03:25:00.640]  spending 75 million dollars a year arming special agents with drones night
[03:25:00.640 --> 03:25:06.120]  vision goggles guns and assault ships they are equipping their very own army to
[03:25:06.120 --> 03:25:11.440]  deal with polluters so talk about the green police is now our environmental
[03:25:11.440 --> 03:25:15.400]  protection agency so we're going to talk about that in a little bit coming up
[03:25:15.400 --> 03:25:20.840]  but I wanted to go ahead and preview this tech report we've been working on
[03:25:20.840 --> 03:25:24.240]  this tech report for about a month now Rob Jacobson has been working really
[03:25:24.240 --> 03:25:29.080]  hard putting it together and it's going to be about a 40-minute piece in its
[03:25:29.080 --> 03:25:33.800]  entirety we'll probably be playing portions of it on the info wars nightly
[03:25:33.800 --> 03:25:40.520]  news next week but it's kind of ties in to this article out of the Daily Mail
[03:25:40.520 --> 03:25:46.200]  could your views on God and immigration be changed by using magnets so now
[03:25:46.200 --> 03:25:51.280]  they're still working on these studies of how to alter the human brain the
[03:25:51.280 --> 03:25:54.880]  scientists use magnetic stimulation to shut down parts of people's brains
[03:25:54.880 --> 03:25:59.440]  specifically targeting the posterior medial frontal cortex which is
[03:25:59.440 --> 03:26:04.280]  associated with how the brain detects and solves problems and threats participants
[03:26:04.280 --> 03:26:08.760]  reported that their belief in God dropped by a third in tests there was
[03:26:08.760 --> 03:26:14.720]  also a 28% increase in positive feelings towards immigrants so here they're I
[03:26:14.720 --> 03:26:19.560]  guess they're probably trying to foster their argument that God is just a
[03:26:19.560 --> 03:26:23.200]  figment of people's imaginations and that they can be tweaked with a little
[03:26:23.200 --> 03:26:29.200]  bit of magnetic stimulation here and so speaking of mind control now this
[03:26:29.200 --> 03:26:32.840]  tech report kind of touches on Ray Kurzweil and his obsession with Ted
[03:26:32.840 --> 03:26:37.720]  Kaczynski the unabomber I've talked about this before before he was the
[03:26:37.720 --> 03:26:42.880]  unabomber he was a child prodigy accepted into Harvard College at 16 he was
[03:26:42.880 --> 03:26:48.040]  among 22 students who were research subjects in brutalizing psychological
[03:26:48.040 --> 03:26:53.760]  experiments that were rumored to be part of MK ultra and he talks about that in
[03:26:53.760 --> 03:26:58.520]  his manifesto about the electrical stimulation of appropriate parts of the
[03:26:58.520 --> 03:27:03.160]  brain and how memories can be destroyed they could damage parts of the brain
[03:27:03.160 --> 03:27:08.840]  they could be brought to the surface all by electrical stimulation so why are
[03:27:08.840 --> 03:27:12.040]  they still using this why are they trying to tweak the way people feel
[03:27:12.040 --> 03:27:17.560]  about God or their views on immigration where could this sort of thing be used
[03:27:17.560 --> 03:27:22.840]  of course so let's go ahead and play this little teaser trailer for this in
[03:27:22.840 --> 03:27:29.680]  depth tech report it's on the occulted history of technology
[03:27:35.280 --> 03:27:40.760]  if the elite are ruthless they may simply decide to exterminate the mass of
[03:27:40.760 --> 03:27:45.960]  humanity if they are humane they may use propaganda or other psychological or
[03:27:45.960 --> 03:27:50.400]  biological techniques to reduce the birth rate until the mass of humanity
[03:27:50.400 --> 03:27:57.320]  becomes extinct leaving the world to the elite in April of 2000 Wired magazine
[03:27:57.320 --> 03:28:02.720]  published an article why the future doesn't need us what makes this article
[03:28:02.720 --> 03:28:07.560]  and quote even more interesting is the footnote at the bottom of the article
[03:28:07.560 --> 03:28:12.680]  why would tech industry leaders go out of their way to quote Ted Kaczynski's
[03:28:12.680 --> 03:28:19.720]  unabomber manifesto in not one but two separate publications as experimenters
[03:28:19.720 --> 03:28:25.280]  have demonstrated feelings such as hunger, pleasure, anger and fear can be
[03:28:25.280 --> 03:28:29.440]  turned on and off by electrical stimulation of appropriate parts of the
[03:28:29.440 --> 03:28:34.960]  brain brainwashing and mind-reading devices seem like something directly out
[03:28:34.960 --> 03:28:42.760]  of a fictional novel robots cyborgs and life extension technology now to some
[03:28:42.760 --> 03:28:47.120]  disbelief these technologies are a science reality
[03:28:47.120 --> 03:28:51.560]  during the Clinton administration admitted over a half a million Americans
[03:28:51.560 --> 03:28:55.480]  were used as experimental guinea pigs but of course what medical research is
[03:28:55.480 --> 03:29:02.200]  focused on the disease and disabilities of all day all these new things that are
[03:29:02.200 --> 03:29:06.520]  now at the forefront of technology and philosophy and which is you know
[03:29:06.520 --> 03:29:10.920]  combined we find the good transhumanism many feel that technology will advance
[03:29:10.920 --> 03:29:15.360]  and there's not much anyone can do to prevent that so what's the point but is
[03:29:15.360 --> 03:29:21.840]  this really the world we want to live in is there another way all right so that
[03:29:21.840 --> 03:29:25.680]  will be coming soon to infowars.com we're going to be premiering that on the
[03:29:25.680 --> 03:29:29.640]  info wars nightly news probably next Tuesday so be sure to stick around for
[03:29:29.640 --> 03:29:34.600]  that it's filled with a host of experts talking about technologies occulted
[03:29:34.600 --> 03:29:38.520]  roots coming back with David Knight we're going to be giving you our take on
[03:29:38.520 --> 03:29:43.400]  the BLM's latest land grab and what are we going to do about all these rogue
[03:29:43.400 --> 03:29:46.840]  agencies and of course why didn't they talk about that in the debates that's
[03:29:46.840 --> 03:29:53.480]  coming up we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[03:29:53.480 --> 03:29:57.080]  G-C-N radio network
[03:29:58.880 --> 03:30:04.920]  yet another land grab the BLM the Bureau of Land Management is ignoring the real
[03:30:04.920 --> 03:30:09.720]  estate title given by the state of Texas 74 years ago to a farmer now the same
[03:30:09.720 --> 03:30:12.880]  bureaucracy that has ignored property rights for ranchers like Clive and
[03:30:12.880 --> 03:30:16.800]  Bundy in Nevada ignored property rights for miners in Oregon and elsewhere is
[03:30:16.800 --> 03:30:20.840]  coming after the property of a Texas farmer the BLM has decided they will
[03:30:20.840 --> 03:30:25.120]  move the boundary take half his land and his house Congress has allowed
[03:30:25.120 --> 03:30:29.320]  bureaucracies to grow unchecked because Congress doesn't like to pass laws they
[03:30:29.320 --> 03:30:33.280]  have abdicated their constitutional duty to bureaucracies who not only write the
[03:30:33.280 --> 03:30:37.240]  law but often act as their own police force and run their own court no one
[03:30:37.240 --> 03:30:41.440]  in either party in Washington wants to change it these bureaucracies will
[03:30:41.440 --> 03:30:45.320]  destroy every last remnant of your God-given constitutionally protected

[03:33:41.080 --> 03:33:46.200]  let's talk about this latest BLM land grab now this is happening in texas a
[03:33:46.200 --> 03:33:50.640]  texas rancher is now fighting to get back some land that's been in his family
[03:33:50.640 --> 03:33:55.640]  for over half a century it's suddenly being targeted by the Bureau of Land
[03:33:55.640 --> 03:34:00.480]  Management of course the same agency that went after cliven bundy yeah of
[03:34:00.480 --> 03:34:03.800]  course we've seen this over and over again whether it's the novata ranchers
[03:34:03.800 --> 03:34:06.600]  and of course it wasn't just cliven bundy he was the last rancher they put
[03:34:06.600 --> 03:34:09.240]  all the rest of ranchers out of business and these are people who had
[03:34:09.240 --> 03:34:12.440]  property rights they were surface rights they were grazing rights they were
[03:34:12.440 --> 03:34:18.240]  water rights we had miners in oregon who had mineral rights that the BLM came
[03:34:18.240 --> 03:34:21.920]  after recently and as we said throughout all of this they're going to come
[03:34:21.920 --> 03:34:27.840]  after the land rights the deed to your home to the actual land itself those
[03:34:27.840 --> 03:34:30.800]  are different kinds of property rights a lot of people didn't really understand
[03:34:30.800 --> 03:34:34.560]  that and so they were saying well these are just rich ranchers or miners or
[03:34:34.560 --> 03:34:37.360]  whatever we don't really appreciate that i said they're gonna come for your
[03:34:37.360 --> 03:34:40.120]  home well they're coming for this fellow's home at the time that the
[03:34:40.120 --> 03:34:44.280]  Bundy Ranchers going on right after that there was talk about about 90,000
[03:34:44.280 --> 03:34:49.000]  acres this is the Red River that's the boundary between Texas and Oklahoma the
[03:34:49.000 --> 03:34:53.280]  EPA is playing games with the boundaries just to confiscate property
[03:34:53.280 --> 03:34:57.760]  because you gotta understand that Texas is one of the few western states that
[03:34:57.760 --> 03:35:03.080]  the federal government did not claim to have massive property ownership Texas is
[03:35:03.080 --> 03:35:07.280]  mostly privately owned because it was Republic of Texas and then became a
[03:35:07.280 --> 03:35:12.240]  state after that in most of these areas they did not turn over however after
[03:35:12.240 --> 03:35:15.360]  they became states after the civil war there was a change in the way the
[03:35:15.360 --> 03:35:19.120]  government operated previously in the eastern states they would turn that land
[03:35:19.120 --> 03:35:23.120]  over to individuals privately that's the way it's supposed to be the federal
[03:35:23.120 --> 03:35:27.240]  government is not supposed to be a landowner they were granted the district
[03:35:27.240 --> 03:35:30.360]  of Columbia they're not supposed to own the land that's supposed to be in
[03:35:30.360 --> 03:35:33.680]  private hands but they have no respect for our property just like they have no
[03:35:33.680 --> 03:35:37.840]  respect for our other rights a property rights are rights just like our rights
[03:35:37.840 --> 03:35:41.240]  that are violated at the airport our rights that are violated by the NSA and
[03:35:41.240 --> 03:35:44.440]  of course last night you didn't hear anybody talking about liberty except
[03:35:44.440 --> 03:35:48.600]  within the very narrow constructs of civil liberties being violated by the
[03:35:48.600 --> 03:35:52.160]  NSA about the Snowden whistleblowers but this is something that is very
[03:35:52.160 --> 03:35:54.920]  important you're not gonna hear the Democrats talk about it unfortunately you
[03:35:54.920 --> 03:35:58.200]  won't really hear the Republicans talk about this either the Republicans will
[03:35:58.200 --> 03:36:03.280]  occasionally get upset about the fact of the IRS will use asset forfeiture but
[03:36:03.280 --> 03:36:06.800]  they won't talk about the war on drugs which is where this really came from if
[03:36:06.800 --> 03:36:11.280]  we go back to 1984 they passed the comprehensive crime control act of 1984
[03:36:11.280 --> 03:36:15.280]  this is under Ronald Reagan it was pushed by prominent Republicans like Strom
[03:36:15.280 --> 03:36:21.040]  Thurman or in Hatch at the time it was signed by the sainted patriarch of the
[03:36:21.040 --> 03:36:25.640]  GOP Ronald Reagan and what they did with this was they essentially destroyed
[03:36:25.640 --> 03:36:30.760]  property rights why aren't Republicans concerned about that over and above the
[03:36:30.760 --> 03:36:34.960]  issue of the drug war they called it civil asset forfeiture because by calling
[03:36:34.960 --> 03:36:38.560]  it civil they don't have to give you your due process if they called it criminal
[03:36:38.560 --> 03:36:40.960]  you would have the presumption of innocence you would have a jury trial
[03:36:40.960 --> 03:36:44.280]  you'd have all these other prohibitions that are in the Constitution that they
[03:36:44.280 --> 03:36:48.800]  would have to overtly ignore but by calling it civil which is a lie they
[03:36:48.800 --> 03:36:52.200]  can confiscate your property they don't ever have to convict you of a crime they
[03:36:52.200 --> 03:36:55.680]  don't even have to charge you with a crime what they say is that your property
[03:36:55.680 --> 03:36:59.280]  committed a crime and then if you want to get that back because it's civil you
[03:36:59.280 --> 03:37:02.960]  have to sue them in court so most people can't afford to do that so people
[03:37:02.960 --> 03:37:05.640]  have lost their property through this over the years and I think it's
[03:37:05.640 --> 03:37:09.600]  interestingly and that at the same time they were doing this this was passed in
[03:37:09.600 --> 03:37:14.360]  the fall of 1984 a program that had started just a month before was Miami
[03:37:14.360 --> 03:37:20.040]  Vice what was the key thing about Miami Vice these cool Miami cops running this
[03:37:20.040 --> 03:37:24.120]  drug war and they got to do all kind of their writing in these fancy boats these
[03:37:24.120 --> 03:37:28.040]  fancy cars that they had stolen they were teaching the American public
[03:37:28.040 --> 03:37:32.000]  especially law enforcement they were teaching the local police to become
[03:37:32.000 --> 03:37:37.360]  thieves to become blackmailers to steal cars boats and other property that was
[03:37:37.360 --> 03:37:41.360]  the the Psyop that they did they had this thing rolling it out because Ronald
[03:37:41.360 --> 03:37:45.160]  Reagan had been in office for four years they were very excited about this the
[03:37:45.160 --> 03:37:49.720]  Attorney General at the time Richard Thornberg said after five years after
[03:37:49.720 --> 03:37:53.560]  they'd done this I said now we can have forfeiture finance prisons where we put
[03:37:53.560 --> 03:37:58.600]  people who are agents who are driving forfeiture confiscated cars can work in
[03:37:58.600 --> 03:38:02.440]  a forfeiture funded sting operation they're funding all the law enforcement
[03:38:02.440 --> 03:38:07.960]  by outright theft and now we see that it's it's not just the BLM all of these
[03:38:07.960 --> 03:38:12.760]  agencies are acting as their own little empires the Congress abdicates its
[03:38:12.760 --> 03:38:15.880]  authority they don't want to pass all these laws that's why it was perfectly
[03:38:15.880 --> 03:38:19.200]  natural for Nancy Pelosi to say we have to pass it so we can find out what's in
[03:38:19.200 --> 03:38:23.200]  it they create these broad guidelines whether it's the Dodd-Frank bill or these
[03:38:23.200 --> 03:38:26.600]  other things they create these agencies as the Dodd-Frank bill did and then they
[03:38:26.600 --> 03:38:30.440]  set back and wait for them to write laws for a couple years and the Congress
[03:38:30.440 --> 03:38:34.480]  looks at it and then they can if they get if it gets too authoritarian then
[03:38:34.480 --> 03:38:38.120]  they can come in like they're rescuing us from this but these agencies write the
[03:38:38.120 --> 03:38:41.920]  laws not the Congress then they have their own armies as you're talking
[03:38:41.920 --> 03:38:45.400]  about this article that came out today with the EPA they have their own armies
[03:38:45.400 --> 03:38:50.320]  they have their own courts they ignore our due process we have multiple empires
[03:38:50.320 --> 03:38:55.120]  being built in Washington right that is the real danger that we see with us and
[03:38:55.120 --> 03:39:00.000]  people really need to care about this because a lot of people when the whole
[03:39:00.000 --> 03:39:03.080]  thing happened with Clive and Bundy they were like oh he it's just a white
[03:39:03.080 --> 03:39:07.280]  privilege you know the white guy he's just a rich cattle rancher it doesn't
[03:39:07.280 --> 03:39:12.760]  matter here we have this other this other guy in Wyoming they're 16 million
[03:39:12.760 --> 03:39:17.520]  dollars in fines they're saying because he built a stockpond which is actually
[03:39:17.520 --> 03:39:22.360]  good for the environment has no jurisdiction over stockponds exactly
[03:39:22.360 --> 03:39:27.000]  he's a welder right he's got eight acres he got it approved by the state and local
[03:39:27.000 --> 03:39:32.200]  authorities to build a self-contained pond on his little eight acres and then
[03:39:32.200 --> 03:39:36.200]  the EPA comes in and says we own all the water in the world and they start
[03:39:36.200 --> 03:39:38.880]  finding him initially it was going to be seventy five thousand dollars David then
[03:39:38.880 --> 03:39:41.960]  they took it down for it somehow it went down to thirty seven thousand five
[03:39:41.960 --> 03:39:45.040]  hundred it's a deal you know hey only thirty seven thousand five hundred a day
[03:39:45.040 --> 03:39:49.200]  but now they've accumulated fines of 16 million dollars and Leanne when this was
[03:39:49.200 --> 03:39:53.520]  happening with Clive and Bundy you had all these people on the left the press
[03:39:53.520 --> 03:39:57.840]  saying ah he owes millions of dollars you know he owns that to the government
[03:39:57.840 --> 03:40:01.560]  that means he owns it to me because that's a socialist mentality oh he's a
[03:40:01.560 --> 03:40:05.320]  rich rancher I can tell you I was there the Bundy's are not rich okay they're
[03:40:05.320 --> 03:40:09.280]  able to support themselves but they are far far far from rich and this guy is
[03:40:09.280 --> 03:40:13.760]  not rich because he owes a 16 million dollar fine the EPA claims that they're
[03:40:13.760 --> 03:40:17.280]  just laying fines on him every single day and you're absolutely right that was
[03:40:17.280 --> 03:40:21.800]  a talking point that was used oh well that's tax dollars that if you owe 16
[03:40:21.800 --> 03:40:25.240]  million dollars feeling that rich well they're robbing that from you the tax
[03:40:25.240 --> 03:40:29.600]  payer that privileged white guy and that's I mean that you're absolutely
[03:40:29.600 --> 03:40:33.840]  right that was the talking point that was used and now can you imagine if the
[03:40:33.840 --> 03:40:39.600]  EPA drops in there rolls in there with with their assault ships yes I mean
[03:40:39.600 --> 03:40:43.640]  what is that you know it's interesting when we look at this massive military
[03:40:43.640 --> 03:40:47.960]  militarization of the environmental protection agency when we look at this
[03:40:47.960 --> 03:40:53.720]  it's a dangerous field to be in yeah literally a field a few years ago the
[03:40:53.720 --> 03:40:57.640]  the Washington Post noticed that there was an RFP just like we noticed these
[03:40:57.640 --> 03:41:01.360]  RFPs Paul Joseph Watson did about all the ammunition purchases right they
[03:41:01.360 --> 03:41:04.960]  noticed they said why is the Department of Education putting out this stuff for
[03:41:04.960 --> 03:41:09.360]  shotguns and vehicles and ammunition all this kind of why why is the Department
[03:41:09.360 --> 03:41:13.480]  of Education need that well with in less than a year you had a situation where a
[03:41:13.480 --> 03:41:18.400]  family the mother was behind in her school loan and in the middle of the
[03:41:18.400 --> 03:41:23.080]  night the EPA comes in and does a SWAT raid on the family they drag out the
[03:41:23.080 --> 03:41:27.240]  husband they drag out the children face down in the ground knees on their back
[03:41:27.240 --> 03:41:32.360]  guns to their heads because the mother who has left the family is behind on her
[03:41:32.360 --> 03:41:36.160]  student loan that's the kind of over the top authoritarian government that we
[03:41:36.160 --> 03:41:39.800]  have to stop we're not going to stop it in Washington nobody in Washington wants
[03:41:39.800 --> 03:41:44.040]  to stop this nobody but Rand Paul has introduced anything to stop civil
[03:41:44.040 --> 03:41:47.880]  asset forfeiture he introduces it over and over again he's got a co-sponsor in
[03:41:47.880 --> 03:41:51.480]  the House but the rest of the Senate Republican and Democrat can care less
[03:41:51.480 --> 03:41:54.520]  the rest of their presidential candidates Republican and Democrat can care less
[03:41:54.520 --> 03:41:58.080]  there's no consensus for this it's going to have to be stopped at the state at the
[03:41:58.080 --> 03:42:02.440]  local level and it's going to have to be us doing it because our elected
[03:42:02.440 --> 03:42:06.320]  political leaders can't be bothered they love this system right I know they absolutely
[03:42:06.320 --> 03:42:11.280]  love it to rule over this type of tyranny and I know that we can kind of
[03:42:11.280 --> 03:42:14.800]  switch now talking about the debates that was sort of one of the things they
[03:42:14.800 --> 03:42:19.000]  said do black lives matter or do all lives matter and that was a really a
[03:42:19.000 --> 03:42:24.880]  pivotal point here in our country where the the world really was rallying around
[03:42:24.880 --> 03:42:29.140]  what was going on in Ferguson saying finally Americans are waking up to the
[03:42:29.140 --> 03:42:32.720]  fact that they live in a police state everyone was like yes yeah stand up
[03:42:32.720 --> 03:42:37.720]  against this police state this is out of control and then the Soros backed groups
[03:42:37.720 --> 03:42:41.640]  move in there and create it no it's only the black people that are being attacked
[03:42:41.640 --> 03:42:45.040]  by these vicious cops and I'm not saying that they're not being targeted I'm not
[03:42:45.040 --> 03:42:50.520]  making an argument but then it divided everyone then people say fine then
[03:42:50.520 --> 03:42:55.120]  you're on your own against and now we're not doing anything about this police
[03:42:55.120 --> 03:42:59.320]  force that is out of control well it definitely seems like racism has grown in
[03:42:59.320 --> 03:43:02.880]  the last year year and a half since all that happened it's gotten worse in a
[03:43:02.880 --> 03:43:06.080]  sense oh it's actually with the youth I mean they think that everyone's out to
[03:43:06.080 --> 03:43:10.160]  get each other were they've created this division where you people are starting
[03:43:10.160 --> 03:43:13.240]  to separate and go into these different clicks and now we're going after
[03:43:13.240 --> 03:43:17.040]  everybody go to yoga class if you're you're white in Seattle you know they
[03:43:17.040 --> 03:43:21.280]  want to take statues down because that's racist they want to ban flags they
[03:43:21.280 --> 03:43:25.160]  want to do all this stuff it's completely and totally just mind-blowing that this
[03:43:25.160 --> 03:43:28.520]  stuff keeps happening and people are waking up to it it's controlled this is
[03:43:28.520 --> 03:43:33.400]  what they want right what that to happen how can people take seriously a group
[03:43:33.400 --> 03:43:38.320]  that wants to take down the Confederate flag ban this Confederate it's a sign of
[03:43:38.320 --> 03:43:43.320]  oppression and then they want to raise the hammer and sickle in its place I
[03:43:43.320 --> 03:43:46.760]  mean that does not even make sense to me do you know your history when we go
[03:43:46.760 --> 03:43:50.920]  back to the black lives matter issue you can play you can look at the
[03:43:50.920 --> 03:43:53.800]  metrics the statistics a number of different ways you can say well there's
[03:43:53.800 --> 03:43:58.960]  more people who are white who are being hit by the police brutality or you
[03:43:58.960 --> 03:44:02.040]  could say that there is a higher percentage of the black community that's
[03:44:02.040 --> 03:44:05.040]  being hit than a percentage of the white community so both of those are true
[03:44:05.040 --> 03:44:09.120]  but here's the fundamental thing Leanne if you're going to stop this we have to
[03:44:09.120 --> 03:44:12.560]  understand that we're all in this together and that's why they start this
[03:44:12.560 --> 03:44:16.400]  divide and conquer if you're a minority if you're black and you feel like you're
[03:44:16.400 --> 03:44:20.280]  being unfairly targeted at a disproportionate rate why wouldn't you
[03:44:20.280 --> 03:44:24.960]  want to make common cause with the larger population out there and say this is
[03:44:24.960 --> 03:44:28.560]  something that affects all of us not just me not just me because I'm a
[03:44:28.560 --> 03:44:32.760]  minority and I may not be able to have enough power to get this stop that's
[03:44:32.760 --> 03:44:36.640]  why we all need to stand together we need to stand together against these out
[03:44:36.640 --> 03:44:40.200]  of control empires that are called bureaucracies and we need to stand
[03:44:40.200 --> 03:44:44.120]  together against these rules of engagement if you will because it is a
[03:44:44.120 --> 03:44:47.240]  militarization of our police they've turned them into thieves they've told in
[03:44:47.240 --> 03:44:51.480]  the disregard the rule of law with these civil asset forfeiture issues and now
[03:44:51.480 --> 03:44:54.320]  they're doing the same thing with the bureaucracies we need to stand together
[03:44:54.320 --> 03:44:58.640]  as one as people and we need to say this affects all of us and the black
[03:44:58.640 --> 03:45:01.480]  people need to understand that more than anybody because they're the smaller
[03:45:01.480 --> 03:45:05.080]  minority they need to stand and they need to make consensus with the larger
[03:45:05.080 --> 03:45:08.880]  group and if they're going to survive but that's the black leaders are being
[03:45:08.880 --> 03:45:12.720]  run by George Soros and these other people who want a divide and conquer they
[03:45:12.720 --> 03:45:16.880]  want to subject them they want to be race pimps for these people just like we've
[03:45:16.880 --> 03:45:19.640]  seen in the past with the race leaders right and well and they give them the
[03:45:19.640 --> 03:45:23.000]  audience with Hillary Clinton and with all of these other presidential candidates
[03:45:23.000 --> 03:45:27.960]  so that they feel okay now we have power this is working this separating
[03:45:27.960 --> 03:45:32.200]  ourselves from the larger group isn't we are having the power now now we're
[03:45:32.200 --> 03:45:36.840]  going to take down the white privilege and all that dismantle all of that when
[03:45:36.840 --> 03:45:39.800]  it's it's become this divide and conquer thing and rather than all of us
[03:45:39.800 --> 03:45:44.840]  working together toward the common cause I'm trying to educate white people
[03:45:44.840 --> 03:45:49.160]  about the evils of the military police state about the evils of the drug war the
[03:45:49.160 --> 03:45:52.720]  black community has seen this far more than the white community has I would
[03:45:52.720 --> 03:45:56.440]  like for the black people to help me in this to help me to convince the white
[03:45:56.440 --> 03:46:00.200]  people that this is something they're coming for you next folks right okay
[03:46:00.200 --> 03:46:04.760]  let's all stand together to stop this instead we see George Soros and company
[03:46:04.760 --> 03:46:09.280]  paying these people to peel them off to take them out of the fight to make this
[03:46:09.280 --> 03:46:13.280]  about white versus black so we can't convince the white people that the
[03:46:13.280 --> 03:46:17.360]  police really aren't on their side with these kinds of rules of engagement they
[03:46:17.360 --> 03:46:21.240]  need to understand this before it is too late the what the police are being
[03:46:21.240 --> 03:46:25.600]  driven by the federal government to become militarized bullies and they're
[03:46:25.600 --> 03:46:30.080]  shooting as a shoot first curriculum we've shown this in various places in
[03:46:30.080 --> 03:46:34.800]  Nevada the the instructor who at the state academy the state police academy
[03:46:34.800 --> 03:46:39.080]  resigned rather than teach this he said this is a shoot first curriculum it's
[03:46:39.080 --> 03:46:42.760]  being driven by the federal government it's being driven by this racism right
[03:46:42.760 --> 03:46:47.000]  and that's why yeah and that's why you'll see such a difference between the
[03:46:47.000 --> 03:46:52.920]  police officers who have been the older police officers yes yes the newer
[03:46:52.920 --> 03:46:57.040]  younger trained and they're getting six months of training to learn the law so
[03:46:57.040 --> 03:47:01.240]  don't argue with them over the law like you've told me you know you can beat the
[03:47:01.240 --> 03:47:05.120]  rap but you can't beat the ride the police officers like Frank Serpica said
[03:47:05.120 --> 03:47:09.280]  we did everything to avoid using our weapon everything but these guys pull
[03:47:09.280 --> 03:47:11.880]  out the weapon and shoot before anything happens and that's the way they read
[03:47:11.880 --> 03:47:14.960]  that's the training that they're being given that's being directed by the
[03:47:14.960 --> 03:47:19.400]  federal government and we need the black people to stand with us and to help
[03:47:19.400 --> 03:47:23.480]  educate the larger white group about this because the white people are the
[03:47:23.480 --> 03:47:27.520]  ones who don't see it at this point just watch this one of the bows yes driving
[03:47:27.520 --> 03:47:31.240]  down the road police officer comes over pulls him over sir you're missing your
[03:47:31.240 --> 03:47:34.320]  front license plate you know and the next thing you know it escalates within
[03:47:34.320 --> 03:47:38.000]  seconds the officer's lies said that he was dragged down the road by the vehicle
[03:47:38.000 --> 03:47:41.040]  when actuality this cop pulled out a gun and shot him in his head blew his
[03:47:41.040 --> 03:47:45.240]  brains up for missing a license plate right so what if the guy takes off
[03:47:45.240 --> 03:47:48.560]  we've already got his rear license plate number you can find him down the road
[03:47:48.560 --> 03:47:53.880]  that radio is ten times quicker than you can be yes right sit back take a deep
[03:47:53.880 --> 03:47:58.200]  breath reevaluate the situation and look at it from that point of view it's not
[03:47:58.200 --> 03:48:02.880]  worth killing somebody over a death sentence is not you shouldn't die
[03:48:02.880 --> 03:48:05.600]  because of something like that like you said when you get the older police
[03:48:05.600 --> 03:48:08.640]  officers you get the combat vets who then go in and become police officers
[03:48:08.640 --> 03:48:12.000]  these guys have had life experience they've seen things they know how to
[03:48:12.000 --> 03:48:16.960]  de-escalate a situation right sit back and try to use risk management and all
[03:48:16.960 --> 03:48:21.200]  this you know fast in their head and not just go for the gun and time and time
[03:48:21.200 --> 03:48:24.880]  again we keep seeing this pops are just shooting people for no reason and then
[03:48:24.880 --> 03:48:28.080]  it goes to court and they have these people who are bought out and cops get
[03:48:28.080 --> 03:48:31.240]  let off there's some kind of tech now you know technicality and you have another
[03:48:31.240 --> 03:48:36.320]  riot and then it creates more division and segregation it's police people at
[03:48:36.320 --> 03:48:39.320]  the top whether it's the government where there's the police whether it's the
[03:48:39.320 --> 03:48:43.040]  black community leaders they don't want to solve the problem that's the problem
[03:48:43.040 --> 03:48:48.480]  and the white people that I talked to by and large don't get it and every time
[03:48:48.480 --> 03:48:52.520]  you have these the black lives matters comes out here every time they have
[03:48:52.520 --> 03:48:56.840]  someone who shoots a police officer who's not doing anything to anybody then
[03:48:56.840 --> 03:49:01.040]  that reinforces this narrative of the white community that the black
[03:49:01.040 --> 03:49:05.320]  community is just violent they're the source of the problem it isn't the rules
[03:49:05.320 --> 03:49:10.120]  of engagement that are being redefined by the federal government and that's the
[03:49:10.120 --> 03:49:14.880]  issue and that's why we need to come together as one as the people right in
[03:49:14.880 --> 03:49:18.000]  this area and and get rid of this division and that's what's keeping us
[03:49:18.000 --> 03:49:21.360]  from getting anything done about this right and obviously coming up next now
[03:49:21.360 --> 03:49:25.480]  with all of this illegal immigration and we saw that in in the debate last night
[03:49:25.480 --> 03:49:31.200]  where everything was about giving away free stuff and new agencies new
[03:49:31.200 --> 03:49:35.120]  government programs to deal with this it's all free free free free it's not
[03:49:35.120 --> 03:49:38.960]  freedom it's freebies they didn't say anything about the veterans they didn't
[03:49:38.960 --> 03:49:41.880]  know that's one of the things that really pissed me off you know we're
[03:49:41.880 --> 03:49:46.120]  willing to take in people from all over the world we have problems here we have
[03:49:46.120 --> 03:49:49.480]  people here have fought for this country who've tried to do what they can to make
[03:49:49.480 --> 03:49:53.000]  changes throughout this country people who actually believe in the country like
[03:49:53.000 --> 03:49:57.520]  me other veterans who really went in with a pure thought that hey I really want
[03:49:57.520 --> 03:50:00.640]  to make some kind of change I want to make America better than what it is and
[03:50:00.640 --> 03:50:03.840]  I'm willing to put my life on the line and then you come back home and then you
[03:50:03.840 --> 03:50:07.000]  see some guy that's just jumped over or come through a canal or something like
[03:50:07.000 --> 03:50:10.400]  that he's getting free college free health care getting taken care of
[03:50:10.400 --> 03:50:14.280]  meanwhile me and my brothers are either homeless they can't get any kind of
[03:50:14.280 --> 03:50:17.640]  health care whatsoever they're treated like garbage like you know just trash
[03:50:17.640 --> 03:50:20.840]  on the ground so you're a danger to them because you've already been through the
[03:50:20.840 --> 03:50:23.680]  system and you've already seen the government lie to you these people that
[03:50:23.680 --> 03:50:27.640]  they're bringing in are fresh new recruits they're recruiting use as
[03:50:27.640 --> 03:50:31.400]  government ponds right and that's why they're bringing them in that's why they
[03:50:31.400 --> 03:50:35.640]  want to have kindergarten through postgraduate school all paid for by
[03:50:35.640 --> 03:50:39.240]  the government because that's how they control people through the educational
[03:50:39.240 --> 03:50:43.200]  system absolutely and of course they can earn their citizenship by joining the
[03:50:43.200 --> 03:50:48.080]  army so absolutely new recruits well thank you guys so much for joining me in
[03:50:48.080 --> 03:50:51.880]  studio very enlightening there on all of that coming up after the break Paul

[03:53:58.640 --> 03:54:13.040]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show we are wrapping up the fourth hour overdrive
[03:54:13.040 --> 03:54:18.760]  here I'm Leanne McAdoo joining me in studio is Paul Joseph Watson our red
[03:54:18.760 --> 03:54:22.800]  coat here so you're gonna be hosting the nightly news tonight's always very
[03:54:22.800 --> 03:54:27.440]  exciting what do you got coming up there's a university in Toronto University
[03:54:27.440 --> 03:54:31.800]  of Toronto they did a gender neutral bathroom experiment so basically you
[03:54:31.800 --> 03:54:37.760]  know pro transgender gender neutral and basically what happened was all the men
[03:54:37.760 --> 03:54:42.200]  all the young men with hormones raging went in there claimed that they felt
[03:54:42.200 --> 03:54:46.480]  like they were women today because they were transgender for the day and took
[03:54:46.480 --> 03:54:51.760]  pictures on their cell phones of naked women in the shower wow so see that one
[03:54:51.760 --> 03:54:56.600]  coming didn't go quite well so again you know these universities these colleges
[03:54:56.600 --> 03:55:01.720]  they're warning about rape culture while allowing men to fill naked women so
[03:55:01.720 --> 03:55:06.320]  the experiment failed completely but they're gonna continue with it anyway
[03:55:06.320 --> 03:55:12.840]  right I mean so you're you're expecting young hormonal people to behave
[03:55:12.840 --> 03:55:18.920]  themselves and right so obviously failed right total failure and I'm sure that
[03:55:18.920 --> 03:55:23.800]  this is going to be the a test pod for other university but they say they're
[03:55:23.800 --> 03:55:26.560]  just gonna continue with it they're not even gonna change the policy so
[03:55:26.560 --> 03:55:32.320]  complete insanity migrant crisis there's a town in Germany lower Saxony a
[03:55:32.320 --> 03:55:37.880]  village with a hundred residents and they're gonna take in 1000 immigrants
[03:55:37.880 --> 03:55:43.040]  wow so they had a meeting in the local town hall and the mayor was like I can't
[03:55:43.040 --> 03:55:47.160]  believe that the citizens would even complain about this 100 people in a
[03:55:47.160 --> 03:55:51.160]  village about to be overwhelmed by a thousand migrants and that's not gonna
[03:55:51.160 --> 03:55:56.080]  be a problem their entire town is gonna be completely transformed exactly
[03:55:56.080 --> 03:56:00.240]  completely transformed and Sweden is now gonna fly migrants directly into the
[03:56:00.240 --> 03:56:04.160]  country via airliners so they've just dispensed with it what did you think
[03:56:04.160 --> 03:56:09.240]  about the article we covered yesterday the 20 migrants suing because they
[03:56:09.240 --> 03:56:12.440]  didn't receive their welfare checks fast enough they had to wait more than a
[03:56:12.440 --> 03:56:16.680]  week well the migrants are complaining at camps in the Netherlands that the
[03:56:16.680 --> 03:56:21.280]  internet is not fast enough because they're not Syrian refugees right only
[03:56:21.280 --> 03:56:24.840]  one in five are so they're fleeing to a higher standard of living they're not
[03:56:24.840 --> 03:56:28.520]  fleeing from war and persecution so we're gonna cover that we're gonna cover
[03:56:28.520 --> 03:56:34.240]  school bands pro-life club posters basically this pro-life group had posters
[03:56:34.240 --> 03:56:38.880]  which said save the baby humans with a picture of a panda or a whale this was
[03:56:38.880 --> 03:56:43.520]  deemed too controversial by this Kentucky school and basically there's a huge
[03:56:43.520 --> 03:56:48.320]  legal fight so you know you can have posters that say using certain words is
[03:56:48.320 --> 03:56:52.080]  as bad as sexual assault again going back to the college rape crisis myth but
[03:56:52.080 --> 03:56:56.880]  having a picture of a panda which says save the baby humans that's too
[03:56:56.880 --> 03:57:01.400]  controversial that's not allowed because it's politically incorrect right I mean
[03:57:01.400 --> 03:57:05.760]  that's it's just so crazy to me how that's the one thing that anyone can
[03:57:05.760 --> 03:57:12.080]  rally around how dare you want to save unborn children from being dissected
[03:57:12.080 --> 03:57:19.120]  into a Petri dish exactly and we're also gonna cover this NSA intelligence
[03:57:19.120 --> 03:57:22.840]  analyst who came out and said that you know a senior European diplomat told him
[03:57:22.840 --> 03:57:26.600]  the entire government the entire government of a European country
[03:57:26.600 --> 03:57:33.120]  considers Obama to be mentally unwell well let's not Obama is also a huge fan
[03:57:33.120 --> 03:57:37.800]  of selfies which they also came out with a study before that said that that was a
[03:57:37.800 --> 03:57:43.760]  sign of you know a little psychosis there as well so he's our selfie king of
[03:57:43.760 --> 03:57:48.280]  self yes King selfie which actually Kit Daniels got has an article MTV says
[03:57:48.280 --> 03:57:53.760]  you're sexist if you hate selfies basically saying that we're talking
[03:57:53.760 --> 03:57:57.800]  about coded conversation about young women who take these selfies in your
[03:57:57.800 --> 03:58:02.440]  sexist but really I it it really enrages me more when I see young men
[03:58:02.440 --> 03:58:08.840]  taking these selfies especially at the gym especially after doing two curl ups
[03:58:08.840 --> 03:58:13.960]  there and then they're like well that's that's what they said they didn't
[03:58:13.960 --> 03:58:17.960]  mention that you know being critical of men taking selfies it was all about
[03:58:17.960 --> 03:58:21.200]  women so again there's no balance with this political correctness well because
[03:58:21.200 --> 03:58:26.040]  it's a war on women so stop being racist and sexist and homophobic Paul all
[03:58:26.040 --> 03:58:30.880]  right well Paul Joseph Watson will be on the Info Wars Nightly News tonight 7
