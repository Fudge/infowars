[08:45.720 --> 08:50.680]  Doug Rocky joining us who was the former head of the Pentagon's depleted
[08:50.680 --> 08:56.240]  uranium weapons program and he wrote the main studies on it and had minimal had
[08:56.240 --> 08:59.520]  him on the last six months or so because he's been in and out getting medical
[08:59.520 --> 09:04.240]  treatment last time I checked he's had over 35 surgeries a lot of his team that
[09:04.240 --> 09:09.440]  was involved just studying do you has died some of them young men and he will
[09:09.440 --> 09:13.560]  break down what do you is doing to our troops and how that dovetails in with
[09:13.560 --> 09:20.080]  Fukushima radiation levels now for eight plus months have been off the charts in
[09:20.080 --> 09:23.800]  many areas of the United States different isotopes readings in the milk in
[09:23.800 --> 09:28.040]  the vegetables that are grown on the surface cows then of course eat the
[09:28.040 --> 09:31.920]  grass off the surface and it bio accumulates in some cases milk has had
[09:31.920 --> 09:35.640]  over a hundred times what they say is normal or safe levels in it but now
[09:35.640 --> 09:40.080]  they just wave magic wands and raise the isotope levels and say it's safe
[09:40.080 --> 09:44.760]  wasn't safe in 86 with Chernobyl now they just wave magic wands and they
[09:44.760 --> 09:50.120]  wave magic trendy wands because of the New York Times or Michael Medved say so
[09:50.120 --> 09:54.120]  you know it's good for you it's like the London Guardian now says it's trendy and
[09:54.120 --> 09:58.400]  radiation is good for you George Monbiot actually said it's wonderful anyone
[09:58.400 --> 10:03.720]  that doesn't like it is insane and you just wave a trendy know-it-all bossy
[10:03.720 --> 10:07.760]  wand and everyone is supposed to listen to you kind like Ron Paul they wave a
[10:07.760 --> 10:11.200]  magic wand and say he can't win you're not supposed to vote for him he's
[10:11.200 --> 10:15.400]  dangerous he's evil he's bad and you're supposed to get in line and say oh my
[10:15.400 --> 10:21.560]  gosh a group of confirmed deceivers and manipulators and preemptive warmongers
[10:21.560 --> 10:26.760]  who've helped turn America into a bankrupt cesspit of global tyranny are
[10:26.760 --> 10:31.480]  now telling me new lies it'd be like getting at the end of a sewage pipe and
[10:31.480 --> 10:36.120]  watching all the horrible affluent the detritus come out and then and then
[10:36.120 --> 10:39.800]  somebody says you know I wouldn't sit there and get a spoon and eat what's
[10:39.800 --> 10:43.200]  coming out of the end of that and you see all this black sludge coming out and
[10:43.200 --> 10:48.240]  they look at you and say your conspiracy theory this is a apple pie because
[10:48.240 --> 10:52.840]  the government and run media said so they're like but it stinks it's coming
[10:52.840 --> 10:55.880]  out the end of a sewage pot and they're like shut up conspiracy theorist
[10:55.880 --> 11:00.880]  conspiracy theory is thinking and asking questions and not believing out of
[11:00.880 --> 11:06.080]  hand what confirmed known liars say and so I am a conspiracy theorist I'm
[11:06.080 --> 11:10.200]  going to admit it right now we've had a bunch of top scientists on probably more
[11:10.200 --> 11:14.920]  than I don't know 20 or so in the last nine months since Fukushima happened and
[11:14.920 --> 11:21.800]  the fastest currents from Japan go up to Alaska in northern Canada and they
[11:21.800 --> 11:26.040]  reported just a few months into it a massive increases in radiation levels
[11:26.040 --> 11:32.800]  in the fish and in seals and now MSNBC is reporting scientists test sick
[11:32.800 --> 11:38.320]  Alaska seals for radiation and it looks like they're dying of radiation
[11:38.320 --> 11:42.000]  poisoning nothing like seal teeth falling out nothing like their hair
[11:42.000 --> 11:46.280]  falling out nothing like blood coming out of them as if all the fast-growing
[11:46.280 --> 11:52.040]  tissue dies you get hit with radiation that's what happens your gums die and
[11:52.040 --> 11:55.880]  start bleeding fast-growing cells are hit that's why children are so susceptible
[11:55.880 --> 11:59.520]  because they're they're fast-growing cells everything in their body is a
[11:59.520 --> 12:05.040]  fast-growing cell except for eggs in a child's ovaries if it's a girl and your
[12:05.040 --> 12:10.280]  eyeballs that's it everything else is changing and growing and you get hit
[12:10.280 --> 12:13.640]  with radiation it's much worse but an adult only thing that's really fast
[12:13.640 --> 12:18.560]  growing is your skin your gums your mucous membranes your intestines and a
[12:18.560 --> 12:22.840]  few other things and boy when you get hit with radiation bye-bye in testing
[12:22.840 --> 12:27.600]  lining bye-bye teeth and that's happening to the seals bye-bye but it
[12:27.600 --> 12:32.680]  doesn't matter because the government waves a trendy wand trendy wand we said
[12:32.680 --> 12:36.440]  it's good oh I have hundreds of articles here where the mainstream media is
[12:36.440 --> 12:40.240]  even admitting world government is the answer they say and here's the Economist
[12:40.240 --> 12:45.320]  magazine top globalist publication last month calling for an end of elected
[12:45.320 --> 12:48.360]  governments running anything and unelected technocracies I showed you the
[12:48.360 --> 12:52.800]  article and a global government run by private banks that's what we've always
[12:52.800 --> 12:56.120]  said the trilateral Commission publicly wrote about and their answers have the
[12:56.120 --> 13:00.480]  New York Times go Alex Jones and Ron Paul are insane doesn't matter if I play
[13:00.480 --> 13:04.440]  Herman von Roepe the head of the EU unelected bureaucrat doesn't matter if I
[13:04.440 --> 13:07.640]  play the former British Prime Minister calling for world government to the
[13:07.640 --> 13:12.320]  crisis and the G20 it doesn't matter if I show you the editor of the Financial
[13:12.320 --> 13:16.760]  Times of London the their foreign desk editor saying and now for world
[13:16.760 --> 13:20.680]  government and saying yes we're authoritarian yes we kept it in secret
[13:20.680 --> 13:25.200]  and yes we're gonna take over and it's for your own good and time magazine Bank
[13:25.200 --> 13:30.360]  of the World time literally hundreds of articles a month you could pull up any
[13:30.360 --> 13:34.840]  and admitting world government is exactly what we said but it didn't matter
[13:34.840 --> 13:39.320]  there were in a week's period hundreds of articles last year in the week that
[13:39.320 --> 13:44.280]  the G20 was meeting just so happen nightlines and ABC news anchor of the
[13:44.280 --> 13:50.120]  ABC nightly news came down here okay and I and he said okay you you you you
[13:50.120 --> 13:53.720]  imagine this world government and I took him in the office and I said okay
[13:53.720 --> 13:57.880]  here's clips of world government here's world leaders saying what the world
[13:57.880 --> 14:02.160]  government is and here's how they're setting it up and he said well that's
[14:02.160 --> 14:05.880]  your interpretation I said no they just said that none of it was in their
[14:05.880 --> 14:11.000]  report and then I went out to dinner with them they took me out to dinner it
[14:11.000 --> 14:16.720]  fell good a child here locally the the the reporter and the producer and we're
[14:16.720 --> 14:21.160]  nice guys and pretty much you know said oh we know a lot of this is true but
[14:21.160 --> 14:28.600]  what are you gonna do I mean talk about mercenaries and to them they really
[14:28.600 --> 14:33.200]  appreciated after the interview I said and they put it on the nightly news where
[14:33.200 --> 14:36.880]  I said you know I'm on my side of the picket line and you're the other people
[14:36.880 --> 14:41.160]  on the other side you know you're just doing your job I'm doing mine and they
[14:41.160 --> 14:50.440]  put that on the news because it's all a big joke they sit there and they tell
[14:50.440 --> 14:55.640]  their viewers and ABC was much nicer than MedVin in the New York Times and
[14:55.640 --> 14:59.680]  all these daily beast and you know Newsweek garbage I mean they actually
[14:59.680 --> 15:04.640]  were somewhat friendly but just you know just said it's my opinion and tried to
[15:04.640 --> 15:08.240]  make me look a little kooky you know that's nice compared to the other stuff
[15:08.240 --> 15:14.720]  they do the other things that the establishment neocons are up to but they
[15:14.720 --> 15:18.960]  know that their audience is just kind of a halfway awake so busy in the rat race
[15:18.960 --> 15:22.200]  that they just kind of halfway read the news or kind of while you're cooking
[15:22.200 --> 15:25.800]  dinner or doing laundry or whatever you got the TV on the background like we
[15:25.800 --> 15:30.000]  all do and you're just halfway kind of listening and everything this system
[15:30.000 --> 15:35.360]  targets people with backfires on them if you can get people to really look at it
[15:35.360 --> 15:39.680]  and go no wait a minute they're saying Ron Paul is nuts and I've got the quotes
[15:39.680 --> 15:45.720]  here and crazy and I'm crazy because we say that there's a plan to reduce world
[15:45.720 --> 15:54.160]  population but I mean when you read what they say that I believe George Bush has
[15:54.160 --> 16:01.280]  a plan to kill us all I never said that that's a strong man that's like what
[16:01.280 --> 16:06.040]  CBS News and Weekly Standard all these publications the last two weeks hundreds
[16:06.040 --> 16:09.560]  of them went with the talking point Alex Jones says they put chemicals in your
[16:09.560 --> 16:13.440]  water to make you gay now I was reading Planned Parenthood UN documents saying
[16:13.440 --> 16:18.320]  we'll put things in the water to reduce fertility and confuse sexual orientation
[16:18.320 --> 16:23.160]  to get rid of the family and then I showed London Guardian where the Pentagon
[16:23.160 --> 16:30.000]  developed gay bombs okay I mean all I mean it's been declassified the CIA
[16:30.000 --> 16:34.560]  developed fast-acting cancers that you can just spray over somebody's house
[16:34.560 --> 16:39.760]  virally and they're gonna get cancer doesn't matter how young or how old they
[16:39.760 --> 16:44.280]  are but see because the public doesn't know about that they just make a little
[16:44.280 --> 16:49.760]  joke and don't point out that I'm actually sourcing what I covered from
[16:49.760 --> 16:55.600]  original direct sources here's an example of this before I get into the New York
[16:55.600 --> 17:00.840]  Times attack pieces and the rest of it this is out of Yahoo news Reuters Yahoo
[17:00.840 --> 17:06.680]  carried Reuters I'm so hyped up to fight these people I'm snorting like a wild
[17:06.680 --> 17:11.200]  horse Venezuela Chavez and again I'm not saying Chavez is even a great guy
[17:11.200 --> 17:15.880]  he's a quasi dictator who probably rigged elections and changed the rules
[17:15.880 --> 17:22.920]  and he's his own brand of trouble but Chavez is not in the main New World Order
[17:22.920 --> 17:27.440]  and it's true every Latin American leader no matter how old or how young
[17:27.440 --> 17:33.280]  that's now opposing the globalist has come down with cancer and the CIA it
[17:33.280 --> 17:37.120]  turned out in the 50s and 60s and 70s I mean I happen to know from insiders right
[17:37.120 --> 17:42.320]  out here at the MD Anderson mouse facility in in Smithville they're in

[18:01.200 --> 18:06.800]  80s 90s and right through to today it doesn't just have SV 40 which is a death
[18:06.800 --> 18:12.600]  sentence in beds in the cell walls hormone levels lower it triggers and
[18:12.600 --> 18:16.440]  it's designed that's why they picked it and weaponized it to kill you at around

[18:48.120 --> 18:52.800]  confirmation of the weaponized cancer and then SV 40 in the vaccines not just

[18:56.400 --> 19:00.760]  thousand percentage points 30 years ago to find a child with cancer was like

[24:20.200 --> 24:26.960]  okay I am ranting here because you should be ranting I mean it's an
[24:26.960 --> 24:31.600]  absolute fact they put cancer viruses in many of the vaccines I've dug up the
[24:31.600 --> 24:35.480]  news articles the documents I've shown them to you ad infinitum I'll do another
[24:35.480 --> 24:40.680]  report on it tonight but I mean here it is Reuters Venezuela Chavez did US give
[24:40.680 --> 24:45.080]  Latin American leaders cancer well it's declassified they developed it and
[24:45.080 --> 24:49.880]  tried to get it into Castro but couldn't Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez
[24:49.880 --> 24:53.160]  speculated on Wednesday that the United States might have developed a way to give
[24:53.160 --> 24:56.240]  Latin American leaders cancer why don't you do some research Chavez you can
[24:56.240 --> 24:59.280]  actually dig up the documents that is speculating of course who knows he might
[24:59.280 --> 25:01.760]  have actually given the evidence and Reuters wouldn't give it they always
[25:01.760 --> 25:07.120]  act like you just say things after Argentina's Christina Fernandez joined
[25:07.120 --> 25:11.560]  the list of presidents diagnosed with a disease it was a typically
[25:11.560 --> 25:15.440]  controversial statement by Venezuela's socialist leader who underwent surgery in
[25:15.440 --> 25:19.520]  June to remove a tumor from his pelvis but he stressed that he was not making
[25:19.520 --> 25:23.240]  any accusations just thinking along it would not be strange they developed the
[25:23.240 --> 25:27.280]  technology and his cancer and nobody knew about it until now this is possibly
[25:27.280 --> 25:31.080]  off his TV show he does once a week hey Chavez it's on record I'll show it
[25:31.080 --> 25:36.160]  tonight and is everybody ignorant see what happens is folks who probably tried
[25:36.160 --> 25:39.800]  to bring him documents and the doctors have probably told him this and then he
[25:39.800 --> 25:44.440]  just you know that it's always a rumor it was for 40 years it was a rumor that
[25:44.440 --> 25:49.240]  Gulf of Tonkin was staged no it was in the San Diego Herald Tribune the ships
[25:49.240 --> 25:54.200]  came back after the Gulf of Tonkin months later and even first officers went
[25:54.200 --> 25:58.480]  public and said we were not attacked it was made up we were told to shut up and
[25:58.480 --> 26:02.440]  then they always call everybody conspiracy theorist because it became a
[26:02.440 --> 26:08.640]  rumor because people didn't have that original article until 40 years later in
[26:08.640 --> 26:15.400]  2004 they declassified the 1964 incident that God is completely in the
[26:15.400 --> 26:20.320]  Vietnam and the release the tapes of McNamara Secretary of Defense sec
[26:20.320 --> 26:26.360]  death on the stinking telephone from DC to the to the ranch outside Austin with
[26:26.360 --> 26:31.760]  LBJ at the LBJ ranch and him telling him that it was staged and they had to go
[26:31.760 --> 26:39.000]  give press conferences and go along with it boom fact not rumor it's the same
[26:39.000 --> 26:44.880]  thing almost everybody goes off what they heard and I understand because you
[26:44.880 --> 26:48.400]  can always have the documents in front of you it was yesterday and the day
[26:48.400 --> 26:53.160]  before I showed you documents and mainstream news and CDC admitting that
[26:53.160 --> 26:58.920]  between all a and almost all products printer ink packaging glasses Coca-Cola
[26:58.920 --> 27:04.920]  can linings all the coke can linings juice boxes for kids is massively
[27:04.920 --> 27:10.120]  reducing fertility in men making men feminine hyper feminizing women and
[27:10.120 --> 27:13.400]  accelerating the aging process and sexual tissues and causing massive
[27:13.400 --> 27:17.760]  increases in cancer I showed it all to you we've got the reports posted with the
[27:17.760 --> 27:23.120]  documents and I showed you the Planned Parenthood UN documents about one-shot
[27:23.120 --> 27:27.200]  policy sterilizing forced abortion putting drugs in the water to make you
[27:27.200 --> 27:33.160]  asexual but today I'm just mentioning it so somebody watching could say I just
[27:33.160 --> 27:37.440]  made that up you have to go out and find that we have another big report
[27:37.440 --> 27:40.320]  convincing an all-down coming out either the night or tomorrow Aaron was up
[27:40.320 --> 27:42.640]  late last night he's not here yet I'm gonna find out soon when that reports
[27:42.640 --> 27:49.640]  coming out again it's just condensing more reports we've already done but here
[27:49.640 --> 27:54.360]  it is it would not be strange if they develop the technology to induce cancer
[27:54.360 --> 27:58.760]  and nobody knew about it until now we all we know all about it sharp as I don't
[27:58.760 --> 28:01.680]  know I'm just reflecting he said and televised speech to troops in the
[28:01.680 --> 28:05.520]  military base but this isn't very very very strange it's a bit difficult to
[28:05.520 --> 28:09.280]  explain this to reason it including using the law of probabilities see his
[28:09.280 --> 28:13.320]  doctors have undoubtedly told him because they can go do biopsy and they've
[28:13.320 --> 28:17.640]  removed tumors out of his out of his body and they can tell you all these rare
[28:17.640 --> 28:22.680]  cancers but I got to pull the polio admissions the US government admits
[28:22.680 --> 28:27.840]  over 100 million Americans develop cancer and many of them died from the
[28:27.840 --> 28:34.360]  SV 40 that is in congressional reports from the stinking 1970s just type in
[28:34.360 --> 28:39.880]  you congressional report on SV 40 Americans exposed in polio inoculation
[28:39.880 --> 28:44.400]  you'll get it you'll get the photocopy congressional reports don't believe me
[28:44.400 --> 28:52.520]  go look it up go look it up find out yes your mommy your daddy your son your
[28:52.520 --> 28:57.920]  daughter chances are the scumbags that run things killed them take it
[28:57.920 --> 29:03.040]  personal but more importantly expose these people so we can get them out of
[29:03.040 --> 29:06.600]  office and get them out of control of DARPA and all these systems so they're
[29:06.600 --> 29:11.240]  not there jacking our food and our water with hundreds of chemicals not just
[29:11.240 --> 29:15.760]  BPA not just you know the bisphenol a not just the melamine not just the
[29:15.760 --> 29:19.360]  fluoride not just the radioactive isotopes again all you got to do is
[29:19.360 --> 29:23.960]  type in state of Texas covered up radiation in water and then the whole
[29:23.960 --> 29:27.360]  thing can begin there you're a police officer listing for the first time you
[29:27.360 --> 29:30.680]  think this is crazy just type in government covered up radioactive
[29:30.680 --> 29:34.840]  isotopes and water that will you will go down the rabbit hole there and then
[29:34.840 --> 29:38.640]  you'll discover they're putting it in the water they're assaulting you and your
[29:38.640 --> 29:43.880]  family they're scum they're criminals and as long as you're unconscious to it
[29:43.880 --> 29:51.200]  or as long as you're naive they can go on hurting you we're on the march the
[29:51.200 --> 30:01.400]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with
[30:01.400 --> 30:05.160]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[30:05.160 --> 30:08.920]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[30:08.920 --> 30:13.440]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[30:13.440 --> 30:17.680]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[30:17.680 --> 30:22.280]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[30:22.280 --> 30:26.240]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[30:26.240 --> 30:30.400]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[30:30.400 --> 30:34.360]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[30:34.360 --> 30:38.080]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[30:38.080 --> 30:42.000]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in

[32:00.360 --> 32:05.160]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[32:05.160 --> 32:09.720]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[32:09.720 --> 32:13.680]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have
[32:13.680 --> 32:18.720]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[32:18.720 --> 32:24.000]  the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[32:24.000 --> 32:28.000]  attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the
[32:28.000 --> 32:33.200]  criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[32:33.200 --> 32:36.880]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists
[32:36.880 --> 32:40.360]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[32:40.360 --> 32:45.600]  checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[32:45.600 --> 32:51.280]  have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD

[33:20.560 --> 33:30.240]  all right here's the deal all these mainline politicians and people they're
[33:30.240 --> 33:35.440]  window dressing and I know you know that but we've got to get out to the general
[33:35.440 --> 33:41.440]  public who's finally awake but awake doesn't mean you know the full the full
[33:41.440 --> 33:46.400]  story I mean I've used the analogy many times of I sleep like the dead at my
[33:46.400 --> 33:51.200]  house but when I'm out on the road or at a hotel in a big city with honking
[33:51.200 --> 33:55.640]  horns or whatever outside I tend to wake up three or four times and I'll wake
[33:55.640 --> 34:00.200]  up and know I'm somewhere else and sometimes have to get up out of the bed
[34:00.200 --> 34:07.640]  and look out the window to realize where I am but even though you're awake you
[34:07.640 --> 34:13.080]  don't know where you are and so America was in a deep sleep the world was in a
[34:13.080 --> 34:18.040]  deep sleep to a great extent now it has awakened politically as the big new
[34:18.040 --> 34:23.400]  Brzezinski said in the middle of 2010 a year and a half ago to the council on
[34:23.400 --> 34:26.920]  foreign relations he said the ruling elite we played the clip many times you
[34:26.920 --> 34:30.480]  can pull it up are very concerned because the for the first time in all of
[34:30.480 --> 34:37.800]  history the entire world is awake politically and realizing that the
[34:37.800 --> 34:41.280]  politicians and the main parties are bought and paid for and there's the
[34:41.280 --> 34:47.480]  illusion of choice the ruling class knows that they know that and who is this
[34:47.480 --> 34:52.080]  ruling class it's not like the British Empire 250 years ago they just wanted to
[34:52.080 --> 34:58.880]  dominate and take over places it is a eugenics Empire Hitler was trying to set
[34:58.880 --> 35:04.360]  up a eugenics Empire it is a genetic engineering control freak elite playing
[35:04.360 --> 35:11.680]  God system that you can't bargain with you can't reason with it scientifically
[35:11.680 --> 35:16.760]  has studied humans it plays psych warfare games and it isn't going to give up
[35:16.760 --> 35:23.360]  and go away it isn't going to stop and it runs off of you being unconscious it
[35:23.360 --> 35:29.240]  runs off you being in a trance it runs off you buying into it you must
[35:29.240 --> 35:34.360]  absolutely realize it is a false projection and when you start looking at
[35:34.360 --> 35:40.800]  it from that perspective and you realize my gosh this this propaganda is tailored
[35:40.800 --> 35:48.400]  for unconscious five-year-olds and it's laughable when you're informed it is so
[35:48.400 --> 35:52.400]  incredibly ridiculous but instead of calling those that are in a zombie
[35:52.400 --> 35:57.280]  state idiots and morons and sheeple and I've done it myself I'm as guilty as
[35:57.280 --> 36:02.880]  anybody or more so because it's frustrating we've got to realize that
[36:02.880 --> 36:14.320]  they are in a trance I'll never forget I was six months out of high school and I
[36:14.320 --> 36:19.080]  just wanted to sound reasonable in art class at Austin Community College was
[36:19.080 --> 36:24.440]  taking an art elective or whatever they call them and I was sitting in there we
[36:24.440 --> 36:29.320]  were talking about politics and they said yeah they're they're getting ready to
[36:29.320 --> 36:35.120]  put thumb scanners in to get driver's license and it's wrong and I had heard
[36:35.120 --> 36:38.160]  him pushing it saying was gonna stop illegal immigration I said well you
[36:38.160 --> 36:40.880]  know they need that to track people because of criminals and the guys snap
[36:40.880 --> 36:44.160]  back at me one people in the class he goes listen buddy it's all about tracking
[36:44.160 --> 36:47.360]  and controlling people you've got to understand these systems are designed to
[36:47.360 --> 36:51.200]  be abused and I was like actually you're right I don't know why I just said that
[36:51.200 --> 37:01.720]  I was like 18 years old and it takes people saying you're wrong it takes you
[37:01.720 --> 37:08.000]  double-checking people it takes getting in their face when a cop pulls you over
[37:08.000 --> 37:13.000]  starts asking to search your car you need to not be afraid of them need to be
[37:13.000 --> 37:18.280]  righteous in your indignation and say listen here buddy do I look like a
[37:18.280 --> 37:22.120]  somebody you're looking for oh I forgot you don't actually profile or really look
[37:22.120 --> 37:24.760]  for people that are one of these days much anymore you're just here to
[37:24.760 --> 37:28.360]  revenue generate aren't you well we're just doing the law yeah yeah yeah did you
[37:28.360 --> 37:31.120]  know that the debts are so big we've been signed on to it's impossible to pay
[37:31.120 --> 37:34.640]  them off and you're told raise more money or you'll lose your job your pension
[37:34.640 --> 37:40.120]  it's a bunch of baloney buddy boy I bet you think I'm a cook because there's
[37:40.120 --> 37:43.480]  poison in your water did you know in Austin they had radioactive isotopes
[37:43.480 --> 37:47.680]  to the water don't sit there and laugh at me don't sit there and try to
[37:47.680 --> 37:52.600]  intimidate me I don't care what you do to me anymore I'm beyond all this ball
[37:52.600 --> 37:58.520]  that's what it's gonna take to wake these people up okay I'm gonna settle down
[37:58.520 --> 38:05.800]  right now everything happening has confirmed my worst analysis everything
[38:05.800 --> 38:09.640]  we've seen unfold you think that makes me happy that our show is exploding inside
[38:09.640 --> 38:15.320]  in size and that people are listening more and more to us that is a good thing
[38:15.320 --> 38:20.720]  at least but it's a silver lining in an otherwise dark cloud I wish I was wrong
[38:20.720 --> 38:28.600]  every day I wish it wasn't true I wish I wish but you know what wishing doesn't
[38:28.600 --> 38:33.440]  do it ladies and gentlemen reality is still there at point blank range
[38:33.440 --> 38:37.280]  attacking us and you know what this is a beautiful planet and it's full of great
[38:37.280 --> 38:42.400]  people and it's full of mystery and wonder and goodness and honor and
[38:42.400 --> 38:47.920]  unlimited beauty I was driving to work this morning listening to music and it
[38:47.920 --> 38:56.360]  was a song about you know about even though life is boring now and it's lost
[38:56.360 --> 39:01.240]  its wonder you know life goes on and I was thinking life goes on it loses its
[39:01.240 --> 39:06.280]  wonder the wonderment intensifies as you discover more mysteries as you
[39:06.280 --> 39:10.640]  understand more as your knowledge increases it gets more colorful more
[39:10.640 --> 39:18.320]  vibrant more wild more fulfilling reality is fulfilling facing your fear is
[39:18.320 --> 39:23.000]  fulfilling facing these little magicians and trying to manipulate reality and
[39:23.000 --> 39:28.800]  keep blinders on people unlocking blinders unlocking minds that is treasure
[39:28.800 --> 39:34.400]  that is a trillion times greater than gold and all the treasure in the world
[39:34.400 --> 39:39.960]  being honorable having friends having your ancestors be proud of you having
[39:39.960 --> 39:44.840]  your progeny to come be proud of you being part of what's made humanity good
[39:44.840 --> 39:53.080]  versus what's made humanity bad that is the great secret to everything and so I
[39:53.080 --> 40:00.160]  can't get angry at people who are in mind control who are unconscious but I do
[40:00.160 --> 40:07.040]  get angry at those who clearly know the truth and get off on deceiving people
[40:07.040 --> 40:12.920]  that's the equivalent of some 250 pound power lifter who's an expert in
[40:12.920 --> 40:21.960]  jujitsu beating up a infant oh this is a really fair fight this is this is it's
[40:21.960 --> 40:28.520]  like beating up someone in a coma the propaganda the way these propagandist
[40:28.520 --> 40:32.760]  target people you think this is so ham-fisted this is so dumbed down this
[40:32.760 --> 40:37.400]  is so pathetic no it's not Joseph Gerbil said the Nazi propaganda minister
[40:37.400 --> 40:42.960]  the best propaganda is dumbed down is simple to up to to target the lowest
[40:42.960 --> 40:48.120]  common denominator so they just begin chirping it and repeating it and so then
[40:48.120 --> 40:53.040]  those that are more awake still go along with it just because the crowd is
[40:53.040 --> 40:59.920]  saying it they beat a drum they know about that harmonic power of repeating
[40:59.920 --> 41:04.800]  the lie over and over again and they consciously I mean when I ran into
[41:04.800 --> 41:09.040]  Michael Medved just a nothing talk show host hardly any audience a legend in his
[41:09.040 --> 41:14.840]  own mind but part of a constellation of these these these these carrying crows
[41:14.840 --> 41:18.760]  that sit up in their trees by the thousands and chirp the same talking
[41:18.760 --> 41:23.800]  point over and over again with their sinister eyes that just predatorily I
[41:23.800 --> 41:27.800]  mean I've watched Medved at different events and and and seen him on TV it's
[41:27.800 --> 41:32.280]  this relishing that people are in the dark relishing that you can dominate
[41:32.280 --> 41:36.880]  them relishing that you can lead people who are basically spiritual children
[41:36.880 --> 41:41.160]  over the edge of cliffs that that like vampires they can perch on people in
[41:41.160 --> 41:48.080]  comas and drink their essence I mean it is weak these people are weak but only
[41:48.080 --> 41:54.080]  only made strong by you being unconscious break the mental chains you
[41:54.080 --> 41:58.640]  don't have to believe what I believe in what I discovered what I know all you
[41:58.640 --> 42:03.240]  have to do is realize there's big agendas afoot there's a lot of things
[42:03.240 --> 42:07.640]  happening in this world and get past the jingoism and the slogans and get into
[42:07.640 --> 42:14.480]  real history real primal humanity and realize we are in a scientific
[42:14.480 --> 42:19.480]  dictatorship that is very deep into its phases and the next few phases are not
[42:19.480 --> 42:24.520]  going to be pretty everything that you've seen so far is the preparation for
[42:24.520 --> 42:29.400]  the main event it's the five or six little bouts before the heavyweight
[42:29.400 --> 42:34.960]  championship the 200 plus million killed by governments the last century
[42:34.960 --> 42:40.000]  financed by globalist bankers was only a hors d'oeuvre was only a glass of
[42:40.000 --> 42:45.360]  champagne before the meal it's the vampires having an apple before they
[42:45.360 --> 42:58.400]  devour the stuffed hog those of you who are cowards enjoying this system because
[42:58.400 --> 43:01.760]  there are some that get off on the power manipulation and are camp followers of
[43:01.760 --> 43:06.600]  this demonic system they ride the dragon's tail but there are others who
[43:06.600 --> 43:14.480]  through fear kneel before this system and you will not escape pain you will
[43:14.480 --> 43:23.440]  not escape terror by bowing your knees to this dark general you will destroy
[43:23.440 --> 43:30.320]  yourself and your family and your house there is no making a deal with the new
[43:30.320 --> 43:36.680]  world order and when you realize that you understand that there is not even a
[43:36.680 --> 43:44.680]  choice the only choice is to join the side of light the only choice is to
[43:44.680 --> 43:49.520]  throw yourself against the evil the only choice is to stand before the juggernaut
[43:49.520 --> 43:53.360]  of the new world order and all of us against its treads are an unstoppable
[43:53.360 --> 43:58.480]  force that will defeat this system if you only have faith and stand against the
[43:58.480 --> 44:07.120]  enemy but if you won't do that well you are amongst those timid souls and
[44:07.120 --> 44:11.040]  forget that you are our countrymen forget that you were part of patriots
[44:11.040 --> 44:18.240]  worldwide who love human liberty may your chain sit lightly upon you
[44:18.240 --> 44:28.520]  crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you fetid poisoned meat the meat of old
[44:28.520 --> 44:36.000]  women the meat of downtrodden children the meat of poverty and degradation and
[44:36.000 --> 44:41.240]  humiliation and even more importantly soul-sucked creatures that would riot
[44:41.240 --> 44:48.000]  for some stupid plastic tennis shoes made by Chinese slaves as if that was the
[44:48.000 --> 44:52.840]  ultimate goal in life instead of two nights ago driving home at like nine
[44:52.840 --> 45:00.360]  o'clock seeing on the horizon a giant crescent moon blood red setting dead
[45:00.360 --> 45:07.720]  ahead in the highway magnified by the atmosphere to giant proportions it was
[45:07.720 --> 45:11.160]  stunning and its beauty and my wife was ahead of me as we gone out to dinner
[45:11.160 --> 45:15.120]  after work and she called me and I said you called about the moon didn't you she
[45:15.120 --> 45:21.240]  said look at that beauty that that is something I'd riot for but you don't have
[45:21.240 --> 45:26.520]  to riot you can walk outside smell the oak trees smell the grass you can walk
[45:26.520 --> 45:33.120]  down to a brook and see that sapphire water pour and the sound most beautiful
[45:33.120 --> 45:39.640]  music like a compendium of a trillion symphonies playing in the universe with
[45:39.640 --> 45:48.360]  that beauty that would never end and transcends all pain yes I lie down by
[45:48.360 --> 45:57.920]  still waters on cool green grass that's where my soul lies and that is where it
[45:57.920 --> 46:04.600]  will forever be but you must make the decision to be conscious you must make
[46:04.600 --> 46:10.440]  the spiritual and mental decision in your gut in your heart in your mind in
[46:10.440 --> 46:17.640]  your soul to simply say I open my mind to reality your mind your subconscious
[46:17.640 --> 46:23.680]  already knows the truth you simply must make the decision the truth is knocking
[46:23.680 --> 46:29.400]  at the door you have to open it just like the devil's counterfeit has to be
[46:29.400 --> 46:37.200]  asked in needs to be invited in God has to be invited in as well because in this
[46:37.200 --> 46:46.560]  universe free will is paramount that's why the globalist always tell you what
[46:46.560 --> 46:49.480]  they're gonna do to you before they do it all right let me hit the news quickly
[46:49.480 --> 46:52.880]  before Doug Rocky comes up and then your calls in the third hour and looks like I
[46:52.880 --> 46:56.440]  was wrong Aaron was getting something to eat Aaron has not slept in 30 something

[47:04.520 --> 47:08.320]  food and water total documentation total information warfare against the
[47:08.320 --> 47:18.800]  globalist with our weapon the truth that smashes their black mountains of lies if
[47:18.800 --> 47:21.560]  not it will premiere on the nightly news tonight and then be disseminated to
[47:21.560 --> 47:34.000]  everyone tomorrow okay look at this look at this this is out of the Newsweek
[47:34.000 --> 47:41.280]  publication the Daily Beast properly named Ron Paul's rise hurts the GOP and
[47:41.280 --> 47:45.680]  helps Obama oh and it's one of the good little conservatives in the super trendy
[47:45.680 --> 47:51.680]  liberal Newsweek to destroy true conservatism these guys always pose as
[47:51.680 --> 47:54.960]  conservatives like Newt Enrich like the rest of them when he's not writing a
[47:54.960 --> 47:58.680]  Luminati treatises about the end of the family the end of America global
[47:58.680 --> 48:03.320]  government cybernetic takeover he's prancing around saying I'm conservative
[48:03.320 --> 48:09.080]  Obamacare I'm conservative open borders I'm conservative abortion I'm
[48:09.080 --> 48:14.440]  conservative carbon taxes just like Mitt Romney they're now running the spin
[48:14.440 --> 48:18.280]  that he's taking the lead in some polls which neck and neck with Ron Paul pure
[48:18.280 --> 48:28.800]  bull Mitt Romney same guy just not as ugly as Newt Enrich okay he watches his
[48:28.800 --> 48:34.480]  diet and exercises only efforts that's it but Republicans like to feel like
[48:34.480 --> 48:38.920]  they're betting on a winner like I saw Neocon site making fun of Ron Paul's
[48:38.920 --> 48:44.480]  teeth yeah he's not vain he likes his original teeth just like I did I even
[48:44.480 --> 48:47.240]  got a chip in my front tooth I kind of like it I don't think I'll have it
[48:47.240 --> 48:52.000]  fixed I kind of like my aging body I kind of like my wrinkles I kind of like
[48:52.000 --> 48:55.920]  my hair falling out I like it understand that because I'm not vain
[48:55.920 --> 49:07.600]  it's the opposite I like the process I'm like a streambed carved by water it's
[49:07.600 --> 49:14.120]  beautiful old woman's beautiful if she's not been turned over to evil an old
[49:14.120 --> 49:16.920]  man is beautiful if they've not been turned over to evil but there's nothing
[49:16.920 --> 49:20.720]  uglier than an old evil person
[49:26.960 --> 49:32.240]  look at this one and we got the New York Times attack piece Ron Paul's rise
[49:32.240 --> 49:39.040]  hurts the GOP and helps Obama the greater Ron Paul's success the better
[49:39.040 --> 49:43.640]  chance the Democrats have of using his crackpot notions to characterize all of
[49:43.640 --> 49:46.880]  the GOP now I told you that two weeks ago that's the new talking point by the
[49:46.880 --> 49:50.600]  Iowa governor and others this he'll discredit us conservatives you mean the
[49:50.600 --> 49:53.800]  ones that torture and secret arrest and bankrupt the country along with Obama
[49:53.800 --> 49:57.040]  the ones bought and paid for by the same mega banks the ones part of getting
[49:57.040 --> 50:00.360]  rid of Glass-Steagall but you you mean the people that did this to America and
[50:00.360 --> 50:04.080]  then Ron Paul the one that in the polls beats Obama better than any other
[50:04.080 --> 50:10.480]  candidate you mean that guy so so that's the new talking point and then they
[50:10.480 --> 50:17.280]  have this out of the establishment liberal Newsweek Daily Beast and then
[50:17.280 --> 50:23.400]  Michael Medved continues in here to basically say that Ron Paul's a 9-11
[50:23.400 --> 50:26.920]  truther and then to go after yours truly and we come back from break I'm
[50:26.920 --> 50:30.280]  gonna hit this and then we've got Ron Paul's world there's a whole bunch of
[50:30.280 --> 50:37.840]  these out of the New York Times and I want to get this James Kurchick on talk

[55:12.520 --> 55:17.480]  Ron Paul truly dangerous no people like you that have gone along with the
[55:17.480 --> 55:21.360]  global crime syndicate and gone along with all the lies and the and the
[55:21.360 --> 55:26.560]  tyranny and and and given it a air of respectability you are the people that
[55:26.560 --> 55:31.200]  are truly dangerous those of us that can face the true horror of what all you
[55:31.200 --> 55:36.720]  yes men have helped create nodding to whatever the greatest evil is you are
[55:36.720 --> 55:40.920]  the people that are dangerous and I like to get to this later after our guest is
[55:40.920 --> 55:45.120]  on with us but I mean here is this article out of the New York Times and
[55:45.120 --> 55:50.520]  it's the new talking point that not only is Ron Paul racist because out of tens
[55:50.520 --> 55:54.600]  of thousands of newsletters there were four or five examples in promo ads that
[55:54.600 --> 55:58.880]  were sent out you know that were I guess you could say mildly racist or
[55:58.880 --> 56:02.640]  something which even though you have speeches of Ron Paul back at the time
[56:02.640 --> 56:08.200]  praising Martin Luther King and people and he is who he is let's just ignore
[56:08.200 --> 56:11.960]  that and always chirp about race all day and when Obama you know increases
[56:11.960 --> 56:15.760]  funding to forcibly abort black Africans and that's loving and trendy
[56:15.760 --> 56:20.680]  because after all he's supposedly black so again it's all about ninnying and
[56:20.680 --> 56:25.480]  obsessing over things they say the real issue is he said on C-span there was a
[56:25.480 --> 56:30.600]  New World Order doesn't matter that literally we have books and globalist
[56:30.600 --> 56:34.200]  documents and statements about a New World Order being a global corporate
[56:34.200 --> 56:39.080]  fascist system now openly running Europe and bankrupting the U.S. to spring in
[56:39.080 --> 56:42.360]  the same system they just come out and tell the readers of the New York Times
[56:42.360 --> 56:48.880]  with total disdain for them talking to them like they're mentally handicapped
[56:48.880 --> 56:53.040]  three-year-olds and telling them this doesn't exist and then they get into
[56:53.040 --> 56:58.520]  attacking Alex Jones and they say Ron Paul did say there's a plan to set up a
[56:58.520 --> 57:02.160]  global government and it's just in that the Rockefeller family's involved oh my
[57:02.160 --> 57:08.440]  goody goody gum drops the Rockefeller for five years ago publishes memoir on
[57:08.440 --> 57:12.960]  page 400 and something we've shown it many times here he said yeah there are
[57:12.960 --> 57:15.040]  people that say we want to get rid of sovereignty set up a world government
[57:15.040 --> 57:20.720]  well I say guilty is charged but see they count on you not reading that and
[57:20.720 --> 57:23.920]  Rockefeller thanks the media for helping to suppress this saying we
[57:23.920 --> 57:27.320]  couldn't have done this without you in the last 50 years suppressing it I mean
[57:27.320 --> 57:32.120]  they invite the New York Times editor in Washington Post to Bilderberg and pat
[57:32.120 --> 57:38.960]  them on the head and say you're a good little deceiver good job and they go on
[57:38.960 --> 57:45.480]  to attack him and they say Paul knows where his bread is buttered he regularly
[57:45.480 --> 57:49.120]  appears on the radio program of Alex Jones a vocal 9-11 and New World Order
[57:49.120 --> 57:53.000]  conspiracy theorist oh I'm a critical thinker actually read global's documents
[57:53.000 --> 57:58.160]  in his home state of Texas on Jones show earlier this month Paul alleged the
[57:58.160 --> 58:02.280]  Iranian plot that was on hundreds of different channels I mean mainline TV
[58:02.280 --> 58:07.480]  said that to kill the Saudi ambassador of the United States soil was a
[58:07.480 --> 58:12.520]  propaganda stunt perpetrated by the Obama administration and they linked
[58:12.520 --> 58:17.440]  info wars.com an article were exposing fast and furious as a false flag I
[58:17.440 --> 58:21.600]  guess that's crazy too you know it's admitted the CBS News got the documents
[58:21.600 --> 58:23.920]  where they said they were gonna blame it on the Second Amendment and then it goes
[58:23.920 --> 58:27.360]  into more of it I'm gonna cover more of this later than you got Medved I mean
[58:27.360 --> 58:32.040]  who is I mean I understand why why Medved works for the dark side because
[58:32.040 --> 58:36.760]  it's of his nature he loves it I mean it's just it's like a golem like

[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:40.200]  an embarrassing person coming out and talking about embarrassing candidates
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:45.200]  Ron Paul is embarrassing them he he's against all the corporate welfare he
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:48.440]  actually doesn't want to be you know he wants to keep the Constitution not have
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:51.360]  military on the streets although but like the New York Times and others say
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:55.080]  it's kooky that Ron Paul's worried about troops on the streets even as they set
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:59.240]  up checkpoints all over the country local newspapers are reporting others
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:03.760]  military checkpoints oh oh drones are tracking citizens now in North
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:12.240]  Dakota oh but but it's still kooky it is and I don't think I can be explained by
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:17.040]  anything that the president has done in a positive way syndicated columns Kraut

[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:44.040]  arm yesterday I knew you weren't sure when you could call in but I wanted to
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:47.040]  get into Ron Paul with you since we were talking about him yesterday on the phone
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:51.000]  well why don't you go to break like you're supposed to and come back and
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  we'll talk around Paul that's awesome we got a few minutes right now I mean
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  let's go ahead and kick the ball off right now while the system is in panic
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:05.560]  mode over him absolutely and I'll tell you why he's the only candidate out
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:10.000]  there including president Obama who naturally is going to represent the
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.600]  Democrats of course and all of these Republican candidates he is the only
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:19.600]  candidate that is anti-war and this country better wake up to the fact that
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:25.720]  we've you know Alex I'm 60 years old now and we have been at war for over half of
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:34.800]  my life and they act like it's bizarre and behavior newt English says he's out
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:41.240]  of mainstream this guy's out of touch well if he is then we are a country of
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:46.040]  war but I don't believe so I believe there's an underlying unrest in this
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:50.760]  country right now that we're tired of war we're sick of it and I guarantee you
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:55.120]  pretty much if any of these other guys get elected you're gonna see a war with
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:04:01.560]  Iran oh you're right and I want you to repeat all this recap and expand on it
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:05.640]  this is about the heart and soul of America another preemptive war lying
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:10.400]  and saying another country has nukes it's a total replay of what we saw with
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:15.280]  Iraq and Ron Paul is just talking total common sense and they're acting like
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:20.600]  that's bizarre kind of like somebody I guess in 1939 if you criticize Hitler I
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:24.720]  can't believe I watched the debates and it was interesting a couple weeks ago
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:29.640]  where he got into a battle with Michelle Bachman and Ron told me the great
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:36.600]  statement he said imagine where would we be today had John F Kennedy not talked
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:41.120]  to Nikita Khrushchev during the Cuban Missile Crisis by the way that was when
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:46.960]  Ron Paul was serving in the Navy and had those two not spoken during that
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:53.960]  crisis and work things out talking we probably would not exist today let's
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:56.520]  start over right there governor and we've only got it for 10 minutes on the

[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:30.480]  Ventura is getting ready to go down to Mexico so he's in a hurry but I was
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:33.680]  talking to him privately yesterday about what's happening in the world trying to
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:38.920]  find out if he's gonna be running for libertarian and he just wanted to talk
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:43.160]  about Ron Paul so he's here to talk about Ron Paul in this one segment the
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:47.760]  Dr. Doug Rocky joins us former Minnesota governor host of the hit TV show on
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:53.200]  true TV conspiracy theory bestselling author Jesse Ventura joins us for one
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:09:00.240]  segment governor we have both parties hundreds of publications New York
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:05.680]  Times CBS Nightly News all attacking Ron Paul and saying he's nuts because he
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:10.720]  doesn't want to attack more countries with made-up WMD stories they're openly
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:13.760]  have gotten rid of Posse commentators that are announcing secret arrest of
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:18.240]  citizens with the NDAA they're in the news saying it's insane that he doesn't
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:23.440]  want troops on the streets all of this is happening and it's like the twilight
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:29.000]  zone and Ron Paul is just a mainline old-fashioned American and then we've
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.360]  got the crazies telling us that we're crazy because we don't support total
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:37.160]  tyranny governor give us your breakdown on this
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:42.960]  simple as this I think if people truly are looking for an attempt at change in
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:48.840]  this country changing our where we are and what we will be in the future then
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:53.720]  there's only one candidate and that is what a congressman Ron Paul he's the
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:57.480]  only candidate that wants to audit the Federal Reserve you notice that the
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:01.720]  other candidates won't even talk about the Federal Reserve he's the only
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:07.120]  candidate that wants to talk rather than wage war so I think this will truly be
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:12.240]  an agenda for the United States of America an agenda determined to
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:17.320]  determine what we stand for do we stand for being the most aggressive warm
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:22.520]  ongoing country in the world who's all set to now to go to war as I ran to
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:27.400]  or are we going to be a country that stands for peace you know let's remember
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:31.840]  the last president that wanted peace and was attempting to get it there would
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:36.840]  have been no Vietnam the Cold War would have been ended by 65 was president
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:42.360]  John F Kennedy and there has not been a president in this country since Kennedy
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:48.240]  who has truly strived for peace but Ron Paul is that candidate and I think about
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:54.080]  it for a minute I'm 60 years old now I was born in 1951 and this country has
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:11:02.960]  been at war for over 30 years ago 60 years we've been at war and if you look
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:08.520]  at the other candidates Ron Paul served in the Navy during the Cuban missile but
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:13.200]  you look at the other candidates did any of them ever serve did any of them ever
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:18.200]  put their butts on the line did they ever go in the military I don't think so
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:22.400]  you know I don't know for sure but I don't I you know I'd love to see them
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:28.800]  with the military backgrounds at Gingrich and the guy from Massachusetts
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:35.440]  Romney and you know right on down the line with all of them and the point of
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:40.800]  the matter is they call Ron Paul's foreign policy scary I call our foreign
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:46.720]  policy scary but it's on right now because all we do is go to war one after
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:51.320]  another after another and I'm one of the people being a veteran who says stop it
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:55.600]  that's enough of this well polls show that upwards of 70% of Americans are
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:59.960]  against all of this the troops give more money to Ron Paul that all of the
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:04.600]  Republican candidates combined and Obama combined and the media spins it and
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:10.000]  says Ron Paul just graces the troops the troops don't like Ron Paul it's all a
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.560]  hoax and more and more the so-called mainstream media is being exposed as a
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:20.880]  bunch of political prostitutes who are losing all their readers and viewers
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:25.200]  well if it's the truth I mean if you look at how they avoid talking about
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:30.640]  Dr. Paul he can be leading in the polls and they don't do in-depth stories on
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:36.440]  him nothing like that the media is in the back pocket of the status quo and I
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:42.240]  can't emphasize more if people in this country want a revolution and a
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:46.480]  revolution doesn't have to be violent but if they want a revolution if they
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:51.840]  want to change in direction truly of the of where this country's headed then Ron
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:56.320]  Paul is the only choice out there right now out of the current candidates in the
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:02.160]  Republican and Democratic field he is the only only one he's the only one that
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:08.040]  says we ought to talk before we shoot talk first shoot second we seem to be
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:13.760]  living if you don't do it our way well then our way will be we will wage war on
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:17.800]  you I mean look what they're doing in this little strip of ocean over there
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:22.920]  Iran threatening to block it off and the US is already threatened if Iran does
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:26.880]  that we're gonna go to war with them basically and and look what's happening
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:31.240]  Iran who imports 50 plus percent of its gasoline they don't have the
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:34.920]  refineries is it's been announced they're gonna shut that off to them
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:39.240]  devastating them and they say okay have you shut us off we'll shut off our
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:44.560]  territorial waters so yesterday they sent a US aircraft carrier through the
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:51.920]  giant Iranian drill as a provocation and the the Pentagon has said if you block
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:56.840]  it we will attack you but but the West as Ron Paul has said is already putting
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:01.040]  these sanctions on and blockades you're an AV guy and Ron Paul's pointed it out
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:06.360]  that is a act of war right there a blockade absolutely and what it does if
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:12.720]  people go back in history we did the same thing to Japan they blockaded Japan
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:17.600]  they stopped all you know a total blockade of the country Japan which
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:23.000]  forced Japan truly to then attack us they were left with two choices surrender
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:28.600]  or attack Japan chose the latter they chose to attack us at Pearl Harbor but a
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:32.920]  lot of people forget we forced their hand at Pearl Harbor by the blockade we
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:38.080]  had against them and the same holds true with Iran now we're blockading them
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:42.280]  we're forcing their hand and they're to you know all of these candidates just
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:48.120]  wait and hope that Iran will do something that Iran will respond so that
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:53.080]  then they can all stand up there and say see we told you all the problems of the
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:58.120]  world that because of Iran and now we're you know now we're getting them meanwhile
[01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:02.240]  our government as you know is overthrown them at least two times evidence of a
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:05.800]  third as well shifting gears here because it's the top of drugs report
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:10.400]  right now Kelly Clarkson the American Idol winner which is about as big as it
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:15.120]  gets nowadays in America says she loves Ron Paul it's a big deal when
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:18.760]  prominent celebrities not just governors that's even more important endorse
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:24.560]  Ron Paul I haven't seen any news where they've been you know given your support
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:28.360]  to Ron Paul do you want to publicly state Governor Ventura that you are
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:33.960]  endorsing Ron Paul absolutely if I mean I'm an independent and I don't you know
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:39.320]  get involved with either political party because I despise both of them but
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:43.760]  out of all the candidates out there in these two major parties right now that's
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:48.640]  the president with the Democrats and the seven or eight Republicans whoever they are
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:53.600]  are I mean I know who they are but why list them Ron Paul has governor Jesse
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:59.280]  Ventura's embarrassment without a doubt it's not even close because I want a new
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:03.160]  president that's going to change the direction of this country I want a new
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:07.280]  president that's going to follow the Constitution I want a new president that's
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:12.160]  going to believe in states rights I want a new president I want somebody that will
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:17.880]  shock the status quo yes and Ron Paul will do that then the only thing we have
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:22.560]  to worry about is keeping him alive but what a dangerous precedent where both
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:27.880]  political party leadership say anybody who could ever potentially be a threat
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:31.920]  we've got to preemptively attack them that's what Hitler said he said I've
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:36.600]  got to attack France and and I've got to attack Poland and I've got to attack
[01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:40.280]  England and the Russians because they might attack us I mean that's what
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:45.680]  tyrants always say let me give this one out to you hypothetical hypothetical
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:50.840]  situation Alex for all you and your listeners let's say Hugo Chavez down in
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:55.600]  Venezuela who's got a lot of money and he fears the United States because of
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:17:00.200]  our military build up and all this and he fears that we could attack them at any
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:05.440]  moment because he kicked out Exxon well what if Hugo Chavez went and got one of
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:11.520]  these unmanned drones and what if Hugo Chavez flew that unmanned drone over
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:16.600]  United States airspace seeking to get intelligence about our war machine and
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:21.920]  what if that drone crashed in our country I would like to pose the question to
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:26.240]  every one of these Republican candidates and state this if you were the
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:31.080]  president what would you do if that happened and I'll bet you their response
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:36.440]  would sound very Iranian wouldn't it oh well they would probably actually say
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:40.480]  attack the country the Iranians agree I think that the United States of an
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:45.760]  unmanned drone flew over our airspace with surveillance using it for
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:51.160]  surveillance on us and crashed here in our country just as we did in Iran we
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:55.320]  would declare war on whatever country that wasn't to take immediate military
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:18:01.280]  response and it just it just don't nobody asked the question what gives us the
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:07.960]  right to fly unmanned drones over other countries to seek intelligence when we
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:12.880]  certainly would not allow it here the hypocrisy of the United States is so
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:18.840]  ridiculous today Alex that's why I want Ron Paul because Ron Paul will end
[01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:25.920]  United States hypocrisy well you're right governor expanding on that we've
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:29.160]  got to continue to vote for him in supporting because that keeps him at
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:33.640]  the top of the polls and allows him to inject real issues but now they claim
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:38.040]  hackers are going to attack and I predicted this last week so now the
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:42.240]  Republicans are going to take all the Iowa votes and count them in secret that
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:47.360]  CBS News reporting that it's now going to be secret and then and the feds are
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:55.080]  going to come in and help and it sounds like weapons of mass destruction and
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:19:02.240]  ties to al-Qaeda in Iraq you know that's a big load of BS you know they what
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:07.240]  needs to happen in this country is very simple we need to get rid of electronic
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:12.200]  voting machines and we need to go back to paper ballots that can be counted if
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:16.680]  you're not capable of filling in the blank which you've been doing since
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:21.880]  first or second grade in grade school every time you take a test you have to
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:27.120]  do you have to fill in that little circle if the voters not capable of doing
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:30.880]  that they shouldn't even be voting well I've only got a few minutes left governor
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:34.240]  and we won't get to talk to you to your back from Mexico and obviously when you
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:38.600]  get back with a new book coming out in the next next roll out of the next
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:42.560]  season of the TV show but that's why I'm bailing out I want to get out of here
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:47.800]  before the TV show rolls I'll be on the hit list when it rolls this year well
[01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:52.120]  I want to talk about that to get a spy out of this country as I can because they're
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:57.000]  going to be after me what about you know Gary Johnson now is going to seek the
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.200]  libertarian ticket and that's good because he can inject some good ideas
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:04.040]  there but obviously you would be a superstar if you ran and I know the
[01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:06.800]  libertarians now you know I've talked to you and said well seek it because it
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:11.640]  comes out of the state level obviously but you're not going to be throwing your
[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:17.360]  hat in the 2012 race sir I don't think so at this time I don't think that I'm
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:22.440]  mentally ready to seek the presidency at this point in time I would still
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:28.120]  consider a VP shot you know if somebody else if Ron Paul or Gary Johnson or
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:32.280]  whatever I would give that due consideration but if I were to go for
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:37.720]  president I like to insure I go after it to win Alex and as a third party
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:44.040]  candidate it's very difficult to win when you have an incumbent so 2016 suits me
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:49.680]  far better than 2012 does personally well you're working out you're in great
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:54.320]  shape so we know you're gonna be around then Lord well I hope so anyway but
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:59.680]  anyway Alex again I encourage all your listeners if you truly want resolution
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:03.320]  and change in this country there's only one candidate out there in the two
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:07.360]  major parties that's going to give that to you and that's congressman Ron Paul
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:13.480]  of Texas I can't emphasize it more and don't listen to mainstream media Ron
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:19.040]  Paul is achieving huge success with mainstream media against him the status
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:23.960]  quo against him both parties against him that has to tell the American people
[01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:29.200]  something because always remember we're in the predicament we're in today because
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:33.840]  of the Democrats and Republicans they cannot deny it they've been in charge
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:40.560]  there's 100 years now they are the fault they are the problem and the only way
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:45.280]  out of this problem is by electing someone like Ron Paul he's the only way
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:50.160]  out any of these other guys it's going to be business as usual people you're
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:54.440]  gonna have the same government that you've had for the last 50 years if you
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:58.080]  elect anyone for Ron Paul well governor that's my final question and I wanted you
[01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.640]  to make a point on and then I even got to leave us we appreciate you coming on
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:06.280]  the day right before you leave town but looking at this normally the so-called
[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:10.560]  mainstream dinosaur media who's been caught lying thousands of times and is
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:15.480]  totally discredited could demonize somebody and it would work but now even
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:19.600]  with his son Rand Paul the more they demonize it actually helps them and so
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:24.320]  the system's got to understand that this shows that the awakening thanks to your
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:28.440]  work and Ron Paul's work and my work and many others is really starting to have
[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:32.760]  an effect and so now the inventors of the internet have gone public and said
[01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:37.600]  yes this new bill so pa does shut down free speech and selectively allows them
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:41.720]  to shut people down for no reason and the government says they want Pentagon on
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:45.280]  the streets and to secretly arrest Americans I mean everything we've
[01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:51.120]  warned about is now manifesting and that shows the system is panicking and
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:55.240]  taking that velvet glove off the iron fist I mean is it really what is it
[01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:58.960]  like to have everything you've warned about now being vindicated and validated
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:03.400]  governor well it's not a good feeling I mean I like to know that I'm right but
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:09.120]  I wish I was wrong I hear you I was completely wrong on this but people need
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:14.400]  again I can't emphasize it enough they're great you know they passed this
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:20.440]  1768 bill that you're talking about that's gonna put American troops inside
[01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:26.080]  our country arresting people let's remember every member of Congress every
[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:30.320]  member of the Senate and Congress and the president including all of our
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:36.680]  military personnel now and before we all have one thing in common we all took
[01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:43.000]  an oath and in that oath we swear to protect the Constitution against all
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:49.240]  enemies foreign and today domestic and I believe every one of these Republican
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:55.520]  candidates is opposed if they voted for that bill then they took a vote against
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:59.600]  the Constitution and they should be impeached for it well I agree they all
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:03.040]  supported it even if they weren't in Congress that they all said yes
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:16.120]  secretly arrest Americans and then they had the Republican candidates they all
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:21.840]  endorsed it except for Ron Paul exactly exactly so if you people believe that
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:25.360]  I'm listening out there believe in your Constitution believe in your bill of
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:28.920]  rights and you believe that these are the founding documents that our country
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:34.280]  should be based upon every one of those candidates is a traitor for having
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:38.120]  supported the bill that will put American troops on the streets arresting
[01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:42.800]  American citizens and then you find out the whole Homeland Security situation
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:47.720]  is for the American people even the LA Times last week had the headline TSA not
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:51.960]  just for airports and they said shopping malls highways they tripled their
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:56.240]  funding governor and they said all 50 states and they said you're gonna get
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:20.480]  Pat Downs everything governor all right sir well thank you so much for spending

[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:36.520]  joins us he hadn't been on in a while I know he's had some health issues you know
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:42.440]  from the du again a lot of his team has died from it and the point is 20 years
[01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:48.360]  ago they wouldn't let the troops 22 years ago or so use this now there's
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:53.520]  just no pretense of control and it's a death sentence and it also is causing

[01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:02.640]  want to ask him in light of Fukushima the FDA of course raised different

[01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:12.480]  what they previously said was safe because as the ongoing meltdown hit the
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:17.200]  US they just said well we say it's okay now go ahead and drink the milk eat the
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:23.000]  food so there's this new attitude that just don't worry about it and it's
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.200]  unprecedented dr. Doug rocky great to have you here with us sir what an honor

[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:54.200]  talking off here about his book and and the fact that his book breaks down the

[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:51.400]  than most national news shows and you're talking to three million people which you
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:56.400]  are a lot of them new listeners what do they need to know about do you why is it
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:01.200]  important what's the story of it you know what happened to you in in in five
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:05.200]  minutes boil it down then we'll get into more detail depleted uranium is the
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:10.480]  United States military owned dirty bomb it is the best weapon ever developed by
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:15.760]  the US military and the German military to destroy and kill everything it's
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:19.240]  absolutely the best there is and as a consequence we've used in military
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:23.800]  operations we're handing it out to all of our so-called friends all over the
[01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:28.880]  world to use as they see fit a lot of other nations have decided they can't
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:31.960]  use it because of the known adverse health and environmental effects that
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:36.320]  have always been known and yet just like Agent Orange and everything else we are
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:41.520]  so arrogant and so intent on killing and destroying that we totally disregard the
[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:45.120]  health and environmental effects on our own people our own military person our
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:50.320]  own sons and daughters and we completely totally totally disregard the health
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:55.800]  and environmental effect on all of God's sons and daughters around the world and
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:37:00.720]  all of his animals because we just want to kill and destroy and even though all
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:04.040]  the medical directors have been out there from day one and during desert storm I
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:08.120]  issued the original medical directive and that was followed up by the theater
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:12.160]  medical command director for third U.S. Army Medical Command and then now they've
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:17.760]  got a brand new medical order Mandy medical care for DU it was just issued
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:23.880]  here on June 10th of this year and yet is totally ignored totally totally ignored
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:27.200]  just like the health and environmental effects of Agent Orange are totally
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:32.120]  ignored because we're the bad guys we messed it up we are using it we're
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:36.080]  going to continue to use it with a total disregard for all the health and
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:40.880]  environmental effects and what we need now is we got a million casualties one
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:45.360]  million U.S. sons and daughter casualties out of the nonsense in the Persian
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:52.360]  Gulf in Afghanistan and they can't get propped up medical care and it's coming
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:56.200]  back to haunt all our communities and they're not employable the families
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:38:00.800]  have been disintegration and there's nobody out there nobody out there
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:05.240]  offering help I mean we're young at the top of our heads and God bless Jesse man
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:09.800]  he's written and yelling at the top is long but there ain't many of us trying
[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:16.640]  to do what's right well dr. Rocky what's what's crazy here and I know you've got
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:21.240]  the numbers I want you to break it down as a top expert as you said 25 years
[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:25.520]  ago they were this was four of the Russians poured across 10 to 1 superiority
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:29.680]  into Germany it was a last-ditch weapon to use once nuclear war was already
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:34.680]  happening it was a force multiplier a secret weapon then the Gulf War comes
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:37.800]  along they go we're just gonna go ahead and use it on Saddam and then they have
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:41.760]  the troops go into the areas that have been hit with it and but still they did
[01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:45.160]  some fake you know decontamination which they sent you in for to quote study
[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:50.720]  which was you know devastating for your health and now it's on record they don't
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:56.280]  they just they they say don't worry about it you have no safety and and now
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:59.360]  they're using it not just at big proofing grounds as you know sir they're
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:02.800]  using them at regular shooting ranges at bases they're using them near
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:07.240]  population centers so explain to people why do you is so deadly well what
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:11.840]  happens is do you is again the primary byproduct of the radio actor
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:16.440]  enrichment process for the US Department of Energy if we're gonna make nuclear
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:20.400]  fuel for our reactors okay generate electricity or we need to make new
[01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:24.280]  nuclear weapons they have to understand we're making new ones all the time okay
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:27.880]  better and better nuclear weapons all the time and we're developing better and
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:33.040]  better dehumidification every day of the week and what happens 99% of
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:38.320]  everything that goes into this process is pure waste if you had any other
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:44.120]  industrial process where 99% of the stuff that goes into it is pure waste you
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:48.640]  would never consider it and so we have uranium hexafluoride and the Department
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:53.600]  of Energy in the military came up with you rid of it number one is the dehumidification
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:58.520]  absolutely incredible number two we use it in ballast and commercial aircraft
[01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:02.160]  and everything else under the thing in other words we need in a forklift
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:06.680]  truck it's heavy but the other thing to this hit hit the scene here in the last
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:11.280]  couple of weeks heavily is they put in the DU creed DU egg in other words are
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:16.160]  mixing the uranium hexafluoride the DU metal in the concrete to reinforce
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:19.800]  concrete structures and everything else and the health facts that we're seeing
[01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:24.200]  right now I mean our depth-stating on the road crews and everybody else much
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:29.520]  less military so we got a total nightmare you can't take radioactive
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:34.760]  materials put it into the environment where everybody can breathe it in
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:38.720]  absorb it through their skin get it in through cuts or get it in through
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:43.720]  digestion and not expect to help the problem to occur and everything we have
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:49.080]  predicted everything we've been predicted and everything that was stated
[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:52.840]  would occur in the Department of Defense's own documents going back that I
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:41:01.400]  can find 70 years has come true and now Pukiyama the catastrophe in Japan well
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:05.120]  you know the levels to clean up all that stuff again how you clean that up
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:09.440]  clean that mess up is exactly that army regulation you already said that my team
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:13.240]  wrote in the TV that gives you the guidelines but you can't clean it up
[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:16.360]  and that's what I found at the Nevada test site when I was director and blow
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:21.600]  everything up you can't clean it up and there is no medical care so all you do
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:28.880]  is wait and get sick and suffer and you die like Jim Rungy I'm just corny
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:33.640]  goodbye well sir I mean I think the best way for you to break this down for
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:37.560]  people is is what's personally happened to you and your team I know we were
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:41.080]  unable to get you on a few months ago you were at the VA I guess they're in
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:44.280]  Virginia I mean I know you don't like to talk about yourself your old warrior
[01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:48.480]  going back to Vietnam but describe to people what you and and folks that have
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:53.080]  worked around do you have gone through well what we've gone into and I mean I
[01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:57.600]  just go back and it's so easy to decide the exact medical problems because the
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:03.520]  Department of Veterans Affairs in their criteria that they have sent out telling
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:11.400]  their positions okay what are the health effects of depleted uranium okay and I
[01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:15.240]  want to quote this verbatim so I don't make any errors okay so I'm pulling it
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:19.880]  all up I don't I'd want to you know miss it on this thing in the Department of
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:26.640]  Veteran Affairs okay the United States and this I'm just a direct quote okay
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:31.840]  United States Department of Veteran Affairs vision 11 this is quote some
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:36.000]  things you need to know about veterans a clinician to guide to veteran
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  specific issues okay so this is the VA's publication to the positions
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:47.880]  providing care telling them what the medical problems are from DU now these
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:52.440]  are exactly what I have and you know when you call that day I'm at the main VA
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:56.240]  with the at the War Industries Clinic in Washington DC they were freaking out when
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:42:59.080]  you guys called that day because they knew what I was there for and all the
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:02.240]  problems are there and the fact that you had found me and what needed to talk
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:07.720]  about it they freaked out anyhow here is exact quote physical symptoms which may
[01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:13.480]  occur as result of exposure to depleted uranium are sleep problems totally
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:18.160]  confirmed on all of us mood swings oh I mean irritability is incredible when
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:23.120]  that weather changes symptoms in the upper and lower respiratory system well
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:27.880]  my doctors are trying to stabilize my respiratory through all kinds of
[01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:32.560]  medications and everything else that control neuropsychological symptoms
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:37.800]  including memory loss that's horrific chronic fatigue immune system
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:44.000]  dysfunction skin rashes you don't want to look at my skin rash when it breaks out
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:50.560]  unusual air loss aching joints headaches abdominal pain sensitivity to
[01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:57.120]  light blurred vision now I'm menstrual disorders I have got that but female is
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:01.800]  horrible and incredible problem where they have to have earliest direct gastro
[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:06.160]  intestinal symptoms where you go between diarrhea and constipation you never
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:10.680]  know nervous system disorders such as numbness and a limb that's happening me
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:16.920]  right now multiple chemical sensitivity and all of the birth effects in whoa that
[01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:21.120]  is what the VA directors have told their positions are the health problems
[01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:26.280]  associated with that when you go to the internal memorandum for the department of
[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:35.440]  defense and this is put together by colonel J. Edgar Wachiyama this was the
[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:39.040]  beginning deserts golf or you know operation Iraqi freedom and direct
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:45.120]  freedom well he stated very clearly told everybody all senior leaderships on the
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:51.600]  medical problems associated with DU whoa the alpha particle taken inside the
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:56.240]  body as large doses has produced and cell damage and cancer lung cancer as well
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:59.520]  documented well yeah because I've had people you know they call me and they
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:03.760]  go hey they don't wear radiation badges and if they did you know this type
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:07.840]  doesn't affect that this isn't like the hot radiation to use layman terms it
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:13.160]  sits in your body at point blank range not only is it radioactive destroying the
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:17.600]  cell DNA but it's toxic correct doctor absolutely because once it gets into the
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:20.360]  body it's right next to the cell destroying everything and tearing up
[01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:23.440]  everything so it's a big difference you know when you're talking through
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:27.400]  different radioactivity again we have to look at do we have internalized do we
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:31.360]  have particulars or do we have like a light bulb where you have the stuff you
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:34.240]  start getting the gamma rays nuclear bombs and everything else like the
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:37.640]  reactor out there that's the hot stuff where you can't get near it this stuff
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:43.240]  is inside the body so the radioactivity which you can't measure with Geiger
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:47.160]  counters and all the other chemical toxicity once it gets into the body
[01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:52.680]  tears it apart quote the beta particle tazer to skin in the lens of the eye I'm
[01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:56.880]  tired eye surgery said I'm tired of the doctors at the VA canceling eye surgery
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:01.640]  because they don't know the outcome for me and then everybody else okay we
[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:09.680]  continue on direct boats okay I mean it just it just goes on and on now I know
[01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:13.320]  you're going from their own documents but specifically we can pull up mainstream
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:18.920]  articles where they admit 12 14 16 times the Burt defects in areas like
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:24.440]  Fallujah I mean even a decade ago live magazine you know admitted massive
[01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:30.320]  birth defect increases and now it's like a curse on our troops and everybody
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:32.880]  claims they want to support the troops but as soon as they have to form
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:37.800]  children or as soon as they get ill it's like your garbage get away from us look
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:42.760]  at the baby second airborne out of poor break North Carolina the children are
[01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:46.760]  being born they're not viable the birth the picture be incredibly high the child
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:51.560]  the the I mean you know spontaneous abortions before the child is born all
[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:56.400]  over in our military you're staggering special for break North Carolina and the
[01:46:56.400 --> 01:47:01.160]  suicides are the greatest record level ever what was it seven times the
[01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:05.360]  previous record the military knows and so now we get the homeland security
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:08.960]  documents and the whole federal government's preparing for war with
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:12.680]  veterans because they're getting ready to take the pensions go ahead you know
[01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:16.640]  exactly right so I mean you know we're looking at the whole thing the DU has
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:20.760]  incredible neurotoxicity effect just like all the pesticides and the burn pit
[01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:26.160]  stuff and all of the immunization so what happens is the PTSD that everybody
[01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:31.080]  experiences a function of three things number one incredible neurotoxicities
[01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:36.960]  number two fear beyond comprehension you go for complete tranquility to share
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:41.120]  chair in a nanosecond and Jesse Ventura is probably one of the world's leading
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:45.080]  experts on that because of what he did for real and then you have the other
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:50.440]  thing too is the realization all of this stuff is lies recently the chief of
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:53.640]  chaplains at Danville VA sent me an article that it showed up after we were
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:57.440]  talking to show up at his desk where they're finally acknowledging that when
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:02.080]  moral dilemmas are created incredible PTSD problems finally one of the good
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:05.600]  egg myth that acknowledges and all of us that have been this have known this
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:10.400]  for you know from antiquity but nobody wants to admit it so when we look at the
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:14.680]  incredible toxic effects of everything we've done and DU is the leading list of
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:20.280]  our munitions because it's the United States dirty bomb radioactive dirty bomb
[01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:24.160]  that we spread all over the world and blow everything up and it's a good it's
[01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:28.400]  like a gun that you kill your enemy but then it delays the killing of you it's
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:31.560]  like a gun that you pull the trigger and it shoots you too well we know that
[01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:34.240]  happens because when we did all the research is the guys that are in the
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:37.760]  tanks that are firing all the stuff came back on to them and to this day you
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:41.380]  have to understand to this day I still can't get medical care for desert
[01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:45.640]  storm friendly fire guys and what happened and this absolutely happened
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:49.120]  this would be an incredible interview to happen one of my guys that today became
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:53.520]  a critical care nurse okay he was DU friendly fire and desert storm they took
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:56.800]  him up to Washington to the main hospital up there you know for medical
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:00.800]  care because I finally got accepted to take him in for care he had DU
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:04.720]  shramble in them they put him in the MRI moved the DU shramble and they put him
[01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:10.480]  in the paraplegic condition really and it was I mean it was just kind of like
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:14.680]  how much worse does it get and then when I also they moved it in his spine and
[01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:19.720]  paralyzed him correct and then and then so they don't provide the care now with
[01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:24.720]  a brand new medical directives June of this year medical directive that's been
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:28.120]  put out to provide medical care for D what they don't tell everybody is your
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:31.600]  original medical directive that we wrote you guys got copies all this that it's
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:35.520]  in beyond treason Gary know it's all over the place Congress has it the
[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:40.240]  military has it you have to do the testing within 72 hours of the initial
[01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:47.040]  exposure and after 30 days post exposure in other words if you're exposed on
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:54.440]  November 1st on December 1st of the following month or November 30th what
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:58.000]  would be in the body that you could ever found as less of one one thousandth of
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:01.720]  what has to get the body and so therefore the testing that they have
[01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:07.080]  will never find it so you're seeing all the physiological effects of psychological
[01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:11.440]  effects and there is no medical evidence that the military will accept the
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:17.600]  Department of Veterans will accept and now they're proliferating its use I've
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:21.880]  seen the numbers it's just exponentially more they're using absolutely
[01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:25.720]  because it's effective at killing a destroy and what scares the bejesus out
[01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:30.360]  of me okay I mean we're so close to war right now I mean just think about this
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:35.280]  all we have to do is have the Iranians say that's it and they sink one ship in
[01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:40.200]  the straight-to-air motion we're gonna do for war and we're gonna have being
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:43.360]  flying all over the place because all the ships and everything else in the
[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:46.960]  aircraft that's how they should but that's okay they'll just tell the troops
[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:50.520]  as they have deformed and dead babies and as the troops died that it's all
[01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:55.320]  right they'll just you know here in the US they just said radiation is good for

[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:33.760]  as garbage so why not kill us they're beyond evil here's a few articles and
[01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:37.560]  info works calm right now New York Times attacks Ron Paul for living in the
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:41.920]  real world they also attack us it's a key article breaking it down they still
[01:54:41.920 --> 01:54:44.760]  say you're crazy if you talk about world government even as it's announced on the
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:50.240]  news CNN poll fundamentally flawed Romney is not leading Ron Paul in Iowa get
[01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:54.880]  that article out to everybody especially Iowa New Hampshire voters saber

[01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:03.160]  straight of our moose yesterday didn't get any news attention here but it was in
[01:55:03.160 --> 01:55:06.960]  the foreign press the US government I guess run by the bankers sent an
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:11.040]  aircraft carrier through the Iranian drill a huge provocation trying to get
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:17.640]  them to do something so it is all just wild and it's all up at info wars dot
[01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:22.200]  com and more TSA confiscates cupcakes and candy allows man to walk through
[01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:27.440]  checkpoint with sword this is a short segment Dr. Rocky I want to come back
[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:30.120]  and more to do in the next hour but let me just talk about the world in general
[01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:34.960]  as a veteran as a patriot they're openly announcing with the NDA they want
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:40.240]  troops on the streets secret arrest of Americans that's mainline news openly
[01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:44.840]  want internet censorship a White House regulations ours calling for arresting
[01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:49.160]  people the criticized government the neocons are doing it I mean America is
[01:55:49.160 --> 01:55:53.280]  really going authoritarian MF global head you know steals a billion plus bucks
[01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:57.440]  gets caught lying doesn't get in trouble I mean the corruption has reached
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:02.560]  insane levels and so why shouldn't the bankers care they'll they'll they'll get
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:08.320]  money off contracts let the troops use DU kills their enemies kills the troops
[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:12.240]  like that peace and Braveheart you know based on a composite of true stories
[01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:16.800]  where the king is attacking you know Braveheart and the Scots and he says
[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:20.640]  okay have the archers fire into the battle and they say but sire will kill
[01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:25.280]  our own troops and he says but we'll we'll kill some of theirs as well and
[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:31.840]  it's just it's like Henry Kissinger in a quoted as calling troops dumb animals
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:37.440]  cannon fodder and it shows there I mean this shows the mindset doctor doesn't
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:41.400]  it that they know DU's deadly our military wouldn't allow it to be used as
[01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:45.080]  you mentioned they had it in the 50s they had reports in the late 40s about it
[01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:51.680]  they never let it be used until until 1991 because something changed even in
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:56.880]  the ruling elite your comments it's total insanity I mean you know we totally
[01:56:56.880 --> 01:57:01.080]  ignore the rules of war we totally ignore the health and environmental
[01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:05.720]  effects of war for economic gain and everything today has become economic
[01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:09.640]  gain when you look at the members of members of Congress use insider
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:13.640]  trader information to make billions dollars that anybody else did would put
[01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:17.760]  them in jail you know it's broken when you have all the bell wave bandits and
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:21.760]  they have to understand man I put myself in complete danger every time I talk
[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:25.480]  because I reveal information they don't want out you know when you look at this
[01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:29.160]  stuff we've been putting together all of these plans on mount operations where
[01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:34.080]  we insert military units to take over civilian government for years you know
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:38.160]  all that operations that plan is totally in place the presidential decision
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:42.600]  directives that put this in place are up and be a congressional review in
[01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:46.520]  other words Congress has no ability to review a presidential decision directive
[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:50.800]  just like the Supreme Court doesn't so you should these directives and
[01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:55.560]  everything else goes on I just finished a book on Abraham Lincoln and what he
[01:57:55.560 --> 01:57:59.120]  had done suspension to Pabius Corpus and everything else and all the civil
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:06.360]  rights violations they did during you know the American Civil War and at the
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:09.920]  end of the book well we're doing it worse today but it's up for us to make the
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:14.840]  decision what we have we either live by the rule of the law or we don't we
[01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:20.400]  either comply with the rule of law and do what's right under God or we don't we
[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:25.560]  can't have it both ways and we can't continue to kill destroy and take over
[01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:29.600]  economic gain while people stuff beautifully said back in 60 seconds I
[01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:32.600]  want you to continue right there because look at what getting rid of the
[01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:36.280]  Bill of Rights and Constitution is done it's allowed the devils to come in and

[02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:33.360]  New York Times it's everywhere NDAA National Defense Authorization Act
[02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:38.320]  establishes martial law in this country and now you're hearing OTSA is going to
[02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:42.200]  be on your streets the army ish none of this has to do with some quote Al Qaeda
[02:00:42.200 --> 02:00:46.640]  threat which is a funny $3 bill anyways it's all aimed at us it's always been
[02:00:46.640 --> 02:00:51.640]  aimed at us by the crooks that took over the country Ponzi scheme operators and
[02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:55.880]  have gotten us to sign on as their slaves now dr. Doug Rocky we're getting
[02:00:55.880 --> 02:00:58.520]  into the decision we have to make and all the police and military you've
[02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:01.700]  trained over the years and you know you said boy I'm putting my life on the
[02:01:01.700 --> 02:01:04.960]  line saying this obviously you know a lot of classified stuff but so much of
[02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:08.280]  this is now out in the open when you talk to police and military from when
[02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:12.120]  I've seen they're really starting to wake up they're like wow I always heard
[02:01:12.120 --> 02:01:16.520]  this but now it's true are you seeing an awakening happening I mean how can they
[02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:21.400]  abuse their own enforcers like this and think they're gonna get away with it and
[02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:26.840]  have some new crop of kids to deal with the old guys it's not gonna work well
[02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:30.520]  it's not because people are waking up I mean go to the Army Times website right
[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:34.560]  now the military is announced they're gonna monitor all communications with
[02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:38.440]  individuals in the military so your emails your letters they're just gonna
[02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:43.080]  automatically monitor it now there there reason is well we don't want the
[02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:46.960]  classified information to get out let me tell you I never have I never will and
[02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:50.280]  I'm not gonna discuss classified information outside of my combat
[02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:54.440]  operations there I don't have to I weren't doing this wrong but what they're
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:58.080]  doing right now is they don't want any discussion or debate about what we're
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:02.120]  doing or how we're doing it that affect men women and children when there's no
[02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:05.960]  viable threat if we have a viable threat baby I'm gonna be the first one to
[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:10.120]  much in the military always been in the military and Jesus Christ I'm only 18
[02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:15.000]  years out of my over 60 years of my life that I haven't been in the military you
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:19.560]  know you're always gonna do it so the whole thing comes on down to what is
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:25.320]  right and what is wrong and what shall we do under a nation of God according
[02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:29.720]  to our Constitution according to our Bill of Rights according to what we did
[02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:34.320]  establish many many years ago but we have forgotten what is right because the
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:38.720]  economic game I mean that's what's about so when somebody says well we got to
[02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:44.360]  attack this nation just like Olivia or a Yemen or you know all the other ones
[02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:48.280]  are Iraq and Canada they posted it right to us no they never have never will well
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:52.880]  what about how they're publicly using al-Qaeda to overthrow the countries well
[02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:57.400]  al-Qaeda has been you know kind of like it was one of ours originally you know I
[02:02:57.400 --> 02:03:00.920]  have to understand how all that came about as a conflict comes a desert
[02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:04.520]  storm and what we have been in disrupting and try to take over all their
[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:08.440]  nations and controlled everything al-Qaeda was a response of bed line was
[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:12.520]  responsible what we had done in their nation to disrupt their way of life to
[02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:17.240]  take over everything so it's again we triggered this now they're pissed off and
[02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:21.080]  they have no other way to counter but do they have does al-Qaeda or anybody have
[02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:24.360]  other in a minor skirmish here or something have any way to suspend our
[02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:27.560]  Bill of Rights versus spend our presidency over through our White House
[02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:32.880]  absolutely not not now never could never will and as long as we have our
[02:03:32.880 --> 02:03:36.160]  Second Amendment rights and we have our freedom of speech and everything else
[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:39.680]  where we speak up and do what's right according to law and acquire a

[02:06:01.240 --> 02:06:04.920]  Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:09.080]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[02:06:09.080 --> 02:06:13.360]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:17.360]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:21.760]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[02:06:21.760 --> 02:06:26.040]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:29.800]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:06:29.800 --> 02:06:33.880]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:06:33.880 --> 02:06:37.840]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:41.680]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[02:06:41.680 --> 02:06:44.400]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:50.400]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:05.360]  hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs
[02:07:05.360 --> 02:07:10.120]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[02:07:10.120 --> 02:07:14.040]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[02:07:14.040 --> 02:07:17.880]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:22.400]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory
[02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:27.720]  system with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the
[02:07:27.720 --> 02:07:32.000]  silver nano particles instantly into the bloodstream with continued
[02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:36.160]  legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce
[02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:41.560]  pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to
[02:07:41.560 --> 02:07:45.400]  follow step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and
[02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:51.520]  simple go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough
[02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:58.440]  technology of the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[02:08:01.640 --> 02:08:06.720]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the
[02:08:06.720 --> 02:08:14.160]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network we're
[02:08:14.160 --> 02:08:19.360]  gonna premiere here for radio listeners and for present planet TV viewers a
[02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:23.240]  15-minute special report that we've been working on all week Aaron Dyke's
[02:08:23.240 --> 02:08:29.600]  denying dealing with eugenics bisphenol a other chemicals purposefully designed
[02:08:29.600 --> 02:08:36.240]  into our society to reduce our fertility and to increase cancer and to confuse
[02:08:36.240 --> 02:08:40.960]  the gender and we happen to have dug up the UN Planned Parenthood documents on
[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:46.560]  it this is devastating information so that's coming up because there's a
[02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:52.800]  method to the madness yes the ruling elite are insane like Hitler he was
[02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:59.480]  just an extension of eugenicist but there's blowback even on them the truth
[02:08:59.480 --> 02:09:02.680]  is they're just psychopaths that love to hurt people and they've created a
[02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:07.920]  cosmology around which the scientific system basically executes this through
[02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:11.960]  compartmentalization but now things are not compartmentalized dr. Doug Rocky
[02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:18.520]  during the break was getting into the fact that this empire this republic is
[02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:22.560]  not gonna fall from without but from within well let's continue with how
[02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:26.680]  they treat people from DU poisoning and and and from your research how much
[02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:31.560]  it's proliferating in its use dr. Rocky because people claim all day you were
[02:09:31.560 --> 02:09:35.440]  mentioning as we went to break the troops everybody's like oh we love the
[02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:41.840]  troops and oh there was a casket of a guy killed by a Air Force MP killed
[02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:48.880]  by a improvised explosive device in Iraq and his buddy another MP captain was on
[02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:53.240]  the plane and we were told to wait while he got off and then everybody stood up
[02:09:53.240 --> 02:09:57.840]  in the plane and old ladies were saluting as the Boston police picked up
[02:09:57.840 --> 02:10:02.360]  the casket and we all waited for 20 minutes till we got off and people were
[02:10:02.360 --> 02:10:06.680]  crying but it was almost like it was eating popcorn or something it was
[02:10:06.680 --> 02:10:11.720]  entertainment it was all just some new emotional thrill to live vicariously
[02:10:11.720 --> 02:10:16.280]  through the dead hero I mean how about you actually don't put them in fraudulent
[02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:21.920]  wars how about you for opium or for weapons sales or no big contracts how
[02:10:21.920 --> 02:10:27.120]  about you actually give them treatment how about you don't have them use DU so
[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:30.360]  oh but see they don't want that actual casually number where they die right
[02:10:30.360 --> 02:10:34.920]  there they'd rather you die in 15 20 years after decades of torturous pain
[02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:41.280]  and to form children it's creeping death it's slow motion genocide dr. Rocky
[02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:44.760]  you were talking about going to local veterans groups and saying okay help our
[02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:48.880]  dead and dying soldiers and they said take a flying leap into the ocean pal
[02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:54.040]  we just want some cash off well-meaning gullible citizens break it down well
[02:10:54.040 --> 02:10:57.600]  let's talk about reality casualty now you have these reports and you've had them
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:11:03.560]  you've updated you can post it here is the real casualties as of October of this
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:11.400]  year 107,256 individuals have infectious and parasite disease 9,367
[02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:20.480]  individuals with malignant cancer 44,290 with benign cancers 220,268
[02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:26.680]  individuals with diseases the endocrine nutritional metabolic system 24,894
[02:11:26.680 --> 02:11:36.960]  cases of leukemia 367,749 with PTSD 310,360 individuals serious
[02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:47.200]  neurological problems 147,267 individuals with cardiac problems 182,783
[02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:57.040]  individuals serious respiratory problems 253,450 450 individuals with digestive
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:12:04.840]  problems 102,661 with serious general unitary 147,617
[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:14.360]  individuals serious rashes 396,552 of us with serious muscular
[02:12:14.360 --> 02:12:22.280]  skeletal problems 359,998 of us with serious field-defying conditions and
[02:12:22.280 --> 02:12:30.280]  200 and 200,846 with serious poisoning that is the reality of casualties just
[02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:34.160]  from OI up and OEF now the numbers for desert storm
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:38.920]  mirrored the percentages mirrored exactly the same that is the real
[02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:44.080]  casually numbers from the nonsense over no threat to the United States but the
[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:49.480]  real casualties and the guys cannot get prompt and optimal medical care and the
[02:12:49.480 --> 02:12:55.200]  problem is there really is no real good medical care to resolve these serious
[02:12:55.200 --> 02:13:00.960]  confirmed medical problems that's a reality isn't nobody wants to discuss it
[02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:04.760]  there's not a mention on the mainstream media there's not a mention in the
[02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:08.920]  newspaper or magazine about the real numbers of casualties delayed in diet
[02:13:08.920 --> 02:13:13.160]  medical care or the fact that there is no effective medical care to treat these
[02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:16.440]  well doctor and again this is one of the biggest cover-ups obviously ever and
[02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:20.040]  you've been tireless exposing it and how many surgeries have you had yourself
[02:13:20.040 --> 02:13:25.320]  to stay alive because of this well I was an active duty as the director of the
[02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:28.480]  depleted uranium project doing the research for the army with the UI had
[02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:34.200]  20 kidney surgeries as the time I was director there's a how are you doing the
[02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:37.960]  research at service director when you're so sick or in out of the hospital in
[02:13:37.960 --> 02:13:42.880]  search after surgery when we were out in the vat a test site blowing the stuff
[02:13:42.880 --> 02:13:47.080]  up to confirm that procedures and other than to write the army regulations I
[02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:54.400]  was literally passing blood and I was having respiratory problems and our
[02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:57.880]  rest of our team wasn't everybody's going my god the department energy
[02:13:57.880 --> 02:14:01.480]  scientists are out there guy what's wrong with you guys you guys should be in
[02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:05.880]  the hospital in an intensive care unit and you're in the field doing research
[02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:09.520]  and blowing the shit up and I go that's right because we have to figure out how
[02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:14.200]  do you protect and clean it all up and we learned you can't do and you can't use
[02:14:14.200 --> 02:14:19.600]  it so the chicken neck bankers the little ivy league punks send the troops
[02:14:19.600 --> 02:14:24.280]  off with a weapon that they know as a death sentence and then they sell their
[02:14:24.280 --> 02:14:28.800]  new wars and their tyranny as if the troops wanted oh don't in the wars the
[02:14:28.800 --> 02:14:34.120]  troops want to keep them going but it's all pure bull and they call Ron Paul
[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:39.840]  insane for not wanting new wars you know what they happen they don't provide the
[02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:44.720]  information of the troops and I mean if they understand Christmas okay you know
[02:14:44.720 --> 02:14:50.520]  I have been dealing with Christmas a horrific thing now for since 1967 okay
[02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:55.040]  because I went on active duty in December 1967 and I was down down at
[02:14:55.040 --> 02:15:00.880]  Lackland Air Force Base we had the meningitis outbreak of 67 in December
[02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:05.680]  1967 I saw people die from meningitis but all this happened in everything else
[02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:12.280]  and so what happens I had five calls over Christmas from Christmas Eve from
[02:15:12.280 --> 02:15:19.520]  Christmas Eve through Christmas five calls for screams for help because over
[02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:23.800]  the holidays all of the problems are intensified now I can't solve these
[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:27.120]  problems all I can do is provide information I could call the VA call the
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:30.400]  department events like talk to my friends and watch it didn't they take care of
[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:34.040]  them take care of them take care of them but when they refuse to do so and they
[02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:39.320]  know they're required to do so because they don't care because they can't admit
[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:42.560]  what we have done to the American sons and daughters of words we sent that's
[02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:45.760]  right I remember the congressional hearings in the mid 90s where it would
[02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:49.320]  show them a marine captain you know photos before totally healthy and the
[02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:52.120]  DU killing him and the guy in a wheelchair and then dying a few months
[02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:56.720]  later and it's it's not patriotic according to the bankers to actually
[02:15:56.720 --> 02:16:00.120]  care about the troops now now before I went to break I want you to you know talk
[02:16:00.120 --> 02:16:04.600]  about this talk about the groups you've gone to to try to help you help dead and
[02:16:04.600 --> 02:16:08.480]  dying trips and get them to the hospital and stuff and what the so-called
[02:16:08.480 --> 02:16:12.160]  veterans groups tell you they don't want to hear it I mean the American
[02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:16.200]  Legion and BFW won't post the information they won't post the casualty data they
[02:16:16.200 --> 02:16:20.160]  won't post the medical directors they won't post the mandatory post
[02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:23.920]  deployment physical assessment form that is supposed to be filled out by every
[02:16:23.920 --> 02:16:27.600]  troop when they're deployed and come back and sometimes they do it most of
[02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:31.280]  time they're not and we know they're disappearing in the official files they
[02:16:31.280 --> 02:16:36.160]  won't help us I can't even get the local American Legion to transport guys with
[02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:42.640]  no legs 30 miles no they just most of them want to go get drunk and watch UFC
[02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:47.320]  and talk about how they love killing Arabs all day and then you're like hey
[02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:50.920]  let's help guys with no legs and they're like eh but I guarantee you their cars
[02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:55.280]  have got American flag and and and veteran stickers all over them well they
[02:16:55.280 --> 02:16:59.360]  always do you know it never ends you know so all these veterans organizations
[02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:03.000]  all you have to do go to any of these organizations that demand money okay
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:07.080]  is the medical directive up there mandate medical care for D is that the
[02:17:07.080 --> 02:17:10.800]  Army pamphlet up there confirming all of the physiological effects of the
[02:17:10.800 --> 02:17:15.440]  medical care required for all the burn pit exposures is the stuff up there on
[02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:19.880]  immunization is the stuff up there that confirms all the health doc the New
[02:17:19.880 --> 02:17:24.080]  York Post this year when Congress was trying to get medical care for people
[02:17:24.080 --> 02:17:27.520]  that's best is poisoning that all the major scientists said yeah we can't
[02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:32.760]  scan their lungs the police the military the firefighters they've all got it the
[02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:37.280]  New York Post and others called the called the veterans of 9-11 ambulance

[02:24:38.760 --> 02:24:42.840]  patriot and a great American who's helped so many countless thousands of
[02:24:42.840 --> 02:24:46.160]  people finishing up with the 9-11 first responders when we come back with a
[02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:51.400]  special report but here's that here's that quote from Cicero back during the
[02:24:51.400 --> 02:24:55.920]  takeover of Julius Caesar a nation can survive its fools and even the
[02:24:55.920 --> 02:25:01.240]  ambitious but it cannot survive treason from within an enemy at the gates is
[02:25:01.240 --> 02:25:05.880]  less formidable for he is known and carries his banner openly but the
[02:25:05.880 --> 02:25:11.360]  traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely his sly whispers rustling
[02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:15.160]  through the alleys heard in the very halls of government itself for the
[02:25:15.160 --> 02:25:18.720]  traitor appears not as a traitor he speaks in accents familiar to his
[02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:23.940]  victims and he wears at their face and their arguments he appeals to the
[02:25:23.940 --> 02:25:28.120]  baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men he rots the soul of a nation
[02:25:28.120 --> 02:25:33.200]  he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the
[02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:38.920]  city he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist a murderer is
[02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:45.320]  less to fear the traitor is the plague that's Marcus Julius Cicero ancient
[02:25:45.320 --> 02:25:50.720]  Roman lawyer writer scholar orator statesman philosopher going back to Doug
[02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:54.200]  Rocky in the few minutes we have left doc that's the point we're making earlier
[02:25:54.200 --> 02:25:58.160]  but you were getting into being the keynote speaker up there as the cover
[02:25:58.160 --> 02:26:02.560]  up of the deadly dust came out please continue what happened there was a
[02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:06.280]  conference calls at the EPA center was going to help the environmental effects
[02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:11.560]  and all this stuff at Cincinnati Ohio I mean we went through so many closed
[02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:15.720]  doors and locked doors we get into the conference room and there was a total
[02:26:15.720 --> 02:26:19.600]  discussion about all the known all the documented evidence from the EPA that
[02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:23.040]  they had found immediately about the horrible health and environmental
[02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:27.760]  consequences of both all of the explosives and the when everything used
[02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:32.320]  at the World Trade Center 9-1-1 and the same thing at the Pentagon and how they
[02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:35.600]  had known from immediately what the problems were again we've called them
[02:26:35.600 --> 02:26:41.280]  that they knew already and that the EPA chief Christine I remember last day was
[02:26:41.280 --> 02:26:46.560]  ordered to lie cheap to steal the covered all up I mean it wasn't box cutters
[02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:49.840]  it caused all the health and environmental effects up there it was
[02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:54.640]  explosives there's no two ways about the same explosives we use all over the
[02:26:54.640 --> 02:26:58.440]  military operations and the same affection everybody so when you look at
[02:26:58.440 --> 02:27:02.720]  what happened with the explosions World Trade Center before you direct it it was
[02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:06.840]  all set up and it continued on and the same thing at the Pentagon there was
[02:27:06.840 --> 02:27:12.320]  absolutely I mean when you look at the Pentagon building performance report and
[02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:16.920]  you really studied it look at the photos and look at the video and then read the
[02:27:16.920 --> 02:27:22.520]  dot read their statements you realize none of it happened and so what we have
[02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:25.280]  is a horrible health and environmental effects and the people in both the
[02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:28.960]  World Trade Center and the Pentagon this day my friends can't get medical care
[02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:33.360]  they can't get medical care and what was in the newspaper the other day they
[02:27:33.360 --> 02:27:36.600]  were told you take it or leave it you got your last option now it's been
[02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:42.080]  ten years that's how we treat those and the way we treat our military personnel
[02:27:42.080 --> 02:27:46.240]  with a million casualties it's horrific and the plague waivers are out there
[02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:50.360]  you know most people they want a six pack of beer and watch a ball game that
[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:53.240]  for them is what it is because they have to take action they have to do
[02:27:53.240 --> 02:27:56.840]  something to help somebody they have to make a commitment that will disrupt
[02:27:56.840 --> 02:28:01.960]  their way of life and maybe affect their income and affect their health but you
[02:28:01.960 --> 02:28:06.080]  know if some of us have to do what's right it's sort of like Cyhurst we did a
[02:28:06.080 --> 02:28:10.520]  book against many book years ago dealing with all the health and environmental
[02:28:10.520 --> 02:28:14.840]  effects of operation deserts or what don't go up or illness and the title of
[02:28:14.840 --> 02:28:19.680]  book the side came up with against all enemies many of us took an oath to
[02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:23.680]  defend the Constitution United States against all enemies both foreign and
[02:28:23.680 --> 02:28:31.960]  domestic well all these scum for power and money that will do anything and and
[02:28:31.960 --> 02:28:35.440]  and will sell out their own mother for a stick of bubblegum they are destroying
[02:28:35.440 --> 02:28:39.920]  our society and all these people they're demonizing Ron Paul and lying about him
[02:28:39.920 --> 02:28:43.560]  all these people trying to keep folks in the dark all these people trying to
[02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:49.200]  prop up this evil when this is all defeated I'm gonna do my best if I'm

[02:30:28.560 --> 02:30:33.840]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on

[02:31:07.600 --> 02:31:11.080]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[02:31:11.080 --> 02:31:14.720]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about perform even gold and

[02:35:25.920 --> 02:35:29.840]  than I can even describe to you here is the special report get it out to
[02:35:29.840 --> 02:35:37.240]  everybody we are under chemical and biological attack the scientific
[02:35:37.240 --> 02:35:42.320]  dictatorship sought to not only overthrow nation states but to destroy
[02:35:42.320 --> 02:35:48.680]  the family and the human species itself all of us are under attack the global
[02:35:48.680 --> 02:35:54.120]  technocrats launch their assaults through covert means through our water and
[02:35:54.120 --> 02:36:00.280]  food supplies as well as household items food packaging prescription and
[02:36:00.280 --> 02:36:05.480]  over-the-counter drugs all of these systems used to deliver their covert
[02:36:05.480 --> 02:36:11.120]  Trojan horse payloads of control if we are unsuccessful in stopping these
[02:36:11.120 --> 02:36:17.280]  technocratic madmen humanity as we know it is a thing of the past the report
[02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:22.400]  that you're about to see documents this horrific fact in detail what you do with
[02:36:22.400 --> 02:36:29.480]  the information is up to you you have been warned the information that you are
[02:36:29.480 --> 02:36:36.040]  about to see and hear is some of the most important info that you will ever
[02:36:36.040 --> 02:36:44.360]  witness in your life I can say that unequivocally and I am begging you for
[02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:50.920]  the sake of you and your family and for our human family to please take notes to
[02:36:50.920 --> 02:36:54.640]  check the different documents and news articles that we're going to show you
[02:36:54.640 --> 02:37:00.760]  here today and prove to yourself that we're telling you the truth in fact
[02:37:00.760 --> 02:37:06.760]  we're only scratching the surface there is a private global corporate government
[02:37:06.760 --> 02:37:16.360]  now operating in the open that is based on the quack science of eugenics and to
[02:37:16.360 --> 02:37:21.200]  put that in a pop culture context or something the general public will
[02:37:21.200 --> 02:37:27.280]  understand Hitler was a eugenicist and he got his ideas from scientists in
[02:37:27.280 --> 02:37:31.760]  England and the United States now the robber barons like the Rockefellers
[02:37:31.760 --> 02:37:38.160]  that funded Hitler early on in the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute still control
[02:37:38.160 --> 02:37:44.000]  this nation and much of the world today and the entire development of modern
[02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:48.840]  sciences through large tax-free foundations and government funding and
[02:37:48.840 --> 02:37:54.840]  DARPA that president Eisenhower warned us about has been in the direction of
[02:37:54.840 --> 02:38:00.240]  basically creating an artificial habitat an artificial system where the
[02:38:00.240 --> 02:38:06.800]  scientific dictators or the technocrats as they call themselves play God over us
[02:38:06.800 --> 02:38:13.720]  and manipulate us they see us as lab rats as guinea pigs now in the last
[02:38:13.720 --> 02:38:18.400]  decade I've talked a lot about eugenics really for more than 16 years on air but
[02:38:18.400 --> 02:38:22.480]  intensely for 10 years or more and in the different documents that we're going
[02:38:22.480 --> 02:38:28.000]  to show you here we found the UN documents the Planned Parenthood documents
[02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:33.640]  the world population organization documents where they openly discussed
[02:38:33.640 --> 02:38:39.160]  breaking up the family getting rid of the quote arcane institution so they
[02:38:39.160 --> 02:38:43.080]  could have their international collectivist system shutting down all
[02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:48.960]  competition against the ultra-rich that is the system that we face as a
[02:38:48.960 --> 02:38:52.680]  society I'm gonna go over some of those documents but up front I want to just say
[02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:58.760]  this the system is scared to death of this information three years ago they
[02:38:58.760 --> 02:39:03.240]  had a bunch of different George Soros affiliated Democratic Party affiliated
[02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:09.880]  groups come out against me and really simplify the straw man that they built
[02:39:09.880 --> 02:39:15.040]  and go after me by saying Alex Jones says the government is putting chemicals
[02:39:15.040 --> 02:39:22.120]  in your food and water to make UK what I had actually said was this phenol A
[02:39:22.120 --> 02:39:30.360]  alone that's in thousands of plastic products printer ink you name it is
[02:39:30.360 --> 02:39:36.480]  lowering male fertility is a estrogen mimiker and is feminizing boys and men
[02:39:36.480 --> 02:39:41.560]  and hyper feminizing women and has been linked in major studies to breast cancer
[02:39:41.560 --> 02:39:48.920]  and other cancers it is devastating our society and these heart hormonal
[02:39:48.920 --> 02:39:57.360]  disruptors are actually running off into the lakes streams and rivers and
[02:39:57.360 --> 02:40:05.880]  confusing the sexual reproduction of nutria rats rodents fish turtles you
[02:40:05.880 --> 02:40:14.040]  name it this is a toxic waste and it is added to our water it is added to our
[02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:20.160]  food it is added through the plastics that are in almost everything to our
[02:40:20.160 --> 02:40:26.400]  daily lives to reduce our fertility now I want to show you first this
[02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:32.160]  document this is from Planned Parenthood to the president of the
[02:40:32.160 --> 02:40:36.840]  population council that was tied in with the United Nations and in it they
[02:40:36.840 --> 02:40:43.640]  break down in 1969 plans to lower population and destroy the family a
[02:40:43.640 --> 02:40:49.360]  postpone or avoid marriage be alter image of ideal family size demonize
[02:40:49.360 --> 02:40:53.400]  having more than one child compulsory education of children they mean
[02:40:53.400 --> 02:40:58.640]  brainwashing listen to this one encourage increased homosexuality
[02:40:58.640 --> 02:41:04.520]  there's another one educate for family limitation fertility control agents in
[02:41:04.520 --> 02:41:09.200]  water supply and the current White House science are John P. Holdren is on
[02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:13.160]  record in multiple books calling for this as well and I got news for you it's
[02:41:13.160 --> 02:41:21.280]  going on now you are being forcibly drugged with toxic chemicals hundreds
[02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:25.240]  of them are added to the water supply including radioactive isotopes not just
[02:41:25.240 --> 02:41:29.360]  sodium chloride that gives you a seven-fold increase in cancer they have
[02:41:29.360 --> 02:41:35.160]  gone absolutely ape over the fact that I'm talking about this because it hits
[02:41:35.160 --> 02:41:41.200]  at the core of how these scientists are playing God okay this is not saying that
[02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:44.840]  people in the Roman times some of them weren't gay or whatever this is not
[02:41:44.840 --> 02:41:51.520]  about a moral issue this is about to reduce population giving men estrogen
[02:41:51.520 --> 02:41:55.680]  mimickers so that they're not attracted to women and so they are less fertile or
[02:41:55.680 --> 02:42:00.760]  infertile but on the other side it's making girls go into puberty at nine
[02:42:00.760 --> 02:42:05.960]  ten years old many of them now at five I've seen some articles as young as three
[02:42:05.960 --> 02:42:10.200]  this is all over the Western world the United States has the highest cancer
[02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:17.160]  rates especially in women and breast cancer it basically accelerates the
[02:42:17.160 --> 02:42:21.280]  aging process to simplify it does a bunch of other horrible things as well
[02:42:21.280 --> 02:42:27.320]  that causes deformities in utero causes more abortions women to have miscarriages
[02:42:27.320 --> 02:42:33.240]  and that's what this document gets into it says compulsory abortion or out of
[02:42:33.240 --> 02:42:37.200]  wedlock pregnancies compulsory sterilization of all who have had two
[02:42:37.200 --> 02:42:41.400]  children what do you see in China our government went over there in the 70s
[02:42:41.400 --> 02:42:47.000]  made a deal with the US government the UN to industrialize China and finance
[02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.600]  them if they do this and now I see articles where they have forced
[02:42:49.600 --> 02:42:53.120]  abortions where they're arresting people are taking their property if they
[02:42:53.120 --> 02:42:57.920]  have more children in the state says they can have that China is the model of
[02:42:57.920 --> 02:43:02.800]  the world break out of this matrix realize that you live in a controlled
[02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:08.400]  society and an artificially constructed civilization that is designed to
[02:43:08.400 --> 02:43:13.120]  dehumanize you and strip you of what it is to be a human taking over our very
[02:43:13.120 --> 02:43:18.600]  reproductive process chemically altering men and women in an early age and even
[02:43:18.600 --> 02:43:23.200]  in utero and what happens when I point this out how does the establishment the
[02:43:23.200 --> 02:43:29.640]  mainstream media these corporate dinosaur mercenaries of propaganda these
[02:43:29.640 --> 02:43:34.520]  prostitutes how do they respond same what they've done for years last week
[02:43:34.520 --> 02:43:42.360]  there were articles in CBS news ABC news you name it attacking myself and Ron
[02:43:42.360 --> 02:43:48.240]  Paul saying Ron Paul goes on Alex Jones a show and Alex Jones says the
[02:43:48.240 --> 02:43:53.320]  government's putting chemicals in your food and water to make you gay you see
[02:43:53.320 --> 02:43:57.080]  they know people are reading that and so they take all this research and they
[02:43:57.080 --> 02:44:00.640]  just turn it into Alex says they want to make you gay and look Ron Paul goes on
[02:44:00.640 --> 02:44:05.280]  their show when what I've really shown here is this is being done to reduce
[02:44:05.280 --> 02:44:11.520]  fertility to increase cancer and to destroy our normal gender roles you're
[02:44:11.520 --> 02:44:16.960]  taking people's choices to have children away you're taking people's choices to
[02:44:16.960 --> 02:44:21.200]  choose their sexual preference away you know they spend it and say you're born
[02:44:21.200 --> 02:44:25.360]  this way and certainly there's different variants of it some of it is natural but
[02:44:25.360 --> 02:44:30.640]  they're artificially adding chemicals that are making rats be confused about
[02:44:30.640 --> 02:44:34.280]  their gender male and female you're being chemically altered here are the
[02:44:34.280 --> 02:44:37.440]  documents here's the White House science are calling for adding stuff to the
[02:44:37.440 --> 02:44:42.640]  water and their answer is oh Alex doesn't like gay people that has nothing to do
[02:44:42.640 --> 02:44:47.720]  with this this is about science and being manipulated by a technocracy that's
[02:44:47.720 --> 02:44:53.000]  playing God the Centers for Disease Control has come out after public
[02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:56.400]  pressure and after scientific pressure and admitted that what's in the printer
[02:44:56.400 --> 02:45:02.760]  ink and the receipt ink and on the money and in thousands of products TV dinners
[02:45:02.760 --> 02:45:09.040]  you name it toilet paper that people are touching is an estrogen mimicker and
[02:45:09.040 --> 02:45:13.920]  was chosen out of thousands of different varieties to be a chemical in the
[02:45:13.920 --> 02:45:20.320]  environment to reduce fertility and to basically turn men into servile creatures
[02:45:20.320 --> 02:45:24.200]  the globalists just want to subdue the population so they can engage in
[02:45:24.200 --> 02:45:29.320]  chemical and biological warfare against us our water our food it's all being
[02:45:29.320 --> 02:45:34.360]  manipulated and it's admitted now that the majority of water supplies in the
[02:45:34.360 --> 02:45:40.200]  US have high levels of Prozac high levels of female hormones high levels of
[02:45:40.200 --> 02:45:44.000]  hundreds and hundreds of other chemicals that are quote runoff the problem is I've
[02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:48.840]  seen the major studies in some cases this stuff is 200 300 400 times higher
[02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:54.760]  than it could be from sewage runoff it's being added to the water there's a
[02:45:54.760 --> 02:45:58.840]  reason the American people and the people of Western Europe will put up with
[02:45:58.840 --> 02:46:03.160]  such incredible tyranny it's because we've been chemically and biologically
[02:46:03.160 --> 02:46:08.280]  manipulated and you find out what it's doing to people it is mind-boggling this
[02:46:08.280 --> 02:46:15.040]  is a holocaust that's going on this is an attack on the human species itself so
[02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:18.480]  these eugenicists can bring in their world government look at this headline
[02:46:18.480 --> 02:46:24.000]  between all a now linked to male infertility and gender confusion here's
[02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:28.280]  another one sperm counts continue to plummet say researchers connected to
[02:46:28.280 --> 02:46:33.560]  Bisphenol a green piece finds toxic chemicals in branded clothing canned
[02:46:33.560 --> 02:46:39.800]  food may expose people to BPA the little juice box liners Canada declares BPA
[02:46:39.800 --> 02:46:44.920]  toxic set stage for more bands FDA faulted for stance on chemicals in
[02:46:44.920 --> 02:46:50.000]  plastics here's the good news a decade ago when you talked about Bisphenol a
[02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:56.720]  and other issues similar to it you were laughed at that isn't happening now the
[02:46:56.720 --> 02:46:59.840]  Canadian government different European governments have moved the last four
[02:46:59.840 --> 02:47:04.840]  years to have it removed by law here in the United States retailers have come
[02:47:04.840 --> 02:47:09.000]  out and advertise that they're Bisphenol a free but the establishment and the
[02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:13.480]  eugenicists have struck back they're now having an added to literally thousands
[02:47:13.480 --> 02:47:17.320]  of different products as I mentioned earlier even toilet paper so that it's
[02:47:17.320 --> 02:47:22.720]  incredibly hard to avoid this stuff these nasty little globalist control freaks
[02:47:22.720 --> 02:47:27.640]  count on you being lazy count on you being trusting they count on you not
[02:47:27.640 --> 02:47:31.760]  researching and finding out the full horror of what they're involved in this
[02:47:31.760 --> 02:47:36.920]  is a total takeover of the biosphere of our planet just like Monsanto's coming
[02:47:36.920 --> 02:47:40.840]  out with seeds the Terminator seeds that don't reproduce you've got to go to
[02:47:40.840 --> 02:47:45.160]  them each time there's a new report out International Journal of Biomedical
[02:47:45.160 --> 02:47:50.600]  Sciences very prestigious Monsanto GMO corn linked to organ failure when you
[02:47:50.600 --> 02:47:55.480]  read deeper in the study it's causing massive infertility in all mammal
[02:47:55.480 --> 02:48:00.400]  species and within three generations near total infertility and guinea pigs
[02:48:00.400 --> 02:48:05.000]  rats there are no human studies you understand we're already a generation
[02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:09.360]  and a half or so into this and we see fertility plummeting within three
[02:48:09.360 --> 02:48:14.520]  generations in all mammal species they tested in 99% infertility and incredible
[02:48:14.520 --> 02:48:18.560]  deformities and now because there's such incredible infertility the globalist
[02:48:18.560 --> 02:48:22.160]  are coming out with the infertility treatments which they sell at incredible
[02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:26.160]  cost to the public they add things to the water add things to the food add
[02:48:26.160 --> 02:48:31.000]  things to the packaging chain by design through these global combines through
[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:34.600]  these agreements and then when you're sterile they come back and for millions
[02:48:34.600 --> 02:48:38.200]  of dollars you go to them for these expensive genetic treatments so you can
[02:48:38.200 --> 02:48:42.320]  have children but they're now designer and the companies can build whatever
[02:48:42.320 --> 02:48:46.120]  trojan horses they want into the back end and then they will have the high tech
[02:48:46.120 --> 02:48:50.840]  treatments that are able to unlock our genetic code and allow us to reproduce
[02:48:50.840 --> 02:48:55.040]  again once the world government's in place in all their own UN and Club of
[02:48:55.040 --> 02:49:01.080]  Rome documents they're talking about an 80% world population reduction that's
[02:49:01.080 --> 02:49:05.000]  what their world government is about that's why the big mega banks that run
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:08.600]  this system want to destroy the world economy so that everybody is dependent
[02:49:08.600 --> 02:49:12.360]  on government they don't want you to be self-sufficient they want you to be
[02:49:12.360 --> 02:49:16.160]  dumbed down and controlled but if you're aware of the chemical and biological
[02:49:16.160 --> 02:49:20.280]  cocktails that are assaulting you we can fight our way out of this by making
[02:49:20.280 --> 02:49:25.200]  choices that limit the amount of exposure we have to this form of warfare
[02:49:25.200 --> 02:49:31.240]  there's a reason all these diseases are increasing because we are being slow
[02:49:31.240 --> 02:49:36.000]  killed we are being soft killed we are being murdered by a cocktail of
[02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:40.520]  poisons this is the ultimate revolution this is the human revolution
[02:49:40.520 --> 02:49:45.320]  against a technocratic psychopathic control freak elite who are playing God
[02:49:45.320 --> 02:49:50.320]  warn everyone you know about this phenol a it's in almost everything clothes
[02:49:50.320 --> 02:49:56.480]  printer ink packaging it's everywhere and retail workers and factory workers
[02:49:56.480 --> 02:50:00.640]  that are around this are being devastated by it let's reclaim our
[02:50:00.640 --> 02:50:04.880]  humanity together don't let them use little cliches about over bashing gay
[02:50:04.880 --> 02:50:09.560]  people or over conspiracy theorist when these criminals attack us with
[02:50:09.560 --> 02:50:13.680]  propaganda we need to shove the facts right back in their face and say we see
[02:50:13.680 --> 02:50:18.320]  you we know what you're doing we've got the facts and we're not laying down and
[02:50:18.320 --> 02:50:23.800]  taking it anymore humanity is awakening to the crimes that you the
[02:50:23.800 --> 02:50:28.440]  eugenicists have been committing against us and you will be brought to

[02:54:13.840 --> 02:54:17.920]  killed by the globalists and we've got to turn this around
[02:54:18.880 --> 02:54:23.840]  truth is a much stranger than fiction
[02:54:23.840 --> 02:54:31.000]  I make a living off the land I ride a John Deere tractor I'm a liberated man
[02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:38.160]  the rain it hasn't fallen since the middle of July and if it don't come soon
[02:54:38.160 --> 02:54:43.160]  my crops will die the bankman says he likes me the bankman says he likes me
[02:54:43.160 --> 02:54:49.160]  but there's nothing he can do he tells me that he's coming but the clouds are
[02:54:49.160 --> 02:54:59.120]  coming to be my friend and I'll ride again and I'll ride again now that 15
[02:54:59.120 --> 02:55:05.720]  minute report that you just heard is what this entire broadcast is about
[02:55:05.720 --> 02:55:10.600]  incredible job by Aaron Dykes incredible documentation if you're a radio
[02:55:10.600 --> 02:55:14.800]  listener and heard it it's powerful but the video makes it many times more
[02:55:14.800 --> 02:55:20.320]  powerful it's gonna go live at info wars.com which is premiered here in the
[02:55:20.320 --> 02:55:24.320]  next 30 minutes or so Aaron is been up for over a day even though I told him
[02:55:24.320 --> 02:55:28.040]  he can have it ready on Friday he wanted to get it done now because once you see
[02:55:28.040 --> 02:55:33.360]  this information you you can't sleep I understand the dedication if more had
[02:55:33.360 --> 02:55:37.240]  that dedication we'd fix this very quickly our problems will be over very
[02:55:37.240 --> 02:55:41.840]  very fast now because some of us are so lazy others of us have to put in the
[02:55:41.840 --> 02:55:47.840]  full the full measure but that is where you find the great dedications the
[02:55:47.840 --> 02:55:52.800]  great challenges of life there in the arena and never let it be said that we
[02:55:52.800 --> 02:55:57.560]  are those timid souls who sat on the sidelines while history was taking place
[02:55:57.560 --> 02:56:01.720]  evil men and tyrants flourish when good men and women do nothing well we're
[02:56:01.720 --> 02:56:08.720]  taking action and you notice we're having an effect but I think I'm gonna name it
[02:56:08.720 --> 02:56:13.960]  that call Aaron back in here I know he's in there uploading and I'm I just
[02:56:13.960 --> 02:56:19.720]  finally settled on a headline and I didn't write it down and I'm now I think
[02:56:19.720 --> 02:56:28.600]  the headline I'm going with is slow kill holocaust and then the sub headline
[02:56:28.600 --> 02:56:34.200]  proof the government is killing you I mean because these are issues where you
[02:56:34.200 --> 02:56:41.320]  can't you can't find words strong enough so that article will be up the next
[02:56:41.320 --> 02:56:46.720]  30 minutes or so with the video at info wars com get it out to everybody you
[02:56:46.720 --> 02:56:52.680]  know and on tonight's nightly news because Hugo Chavez is saying he thinks
[02:56:52.680 --> 02:56:59.160]  Latin American leaders are being given cancer on purpose I'll go over mainstream
[02:56:59.160 --> 02:57:03.640]  news admitting the government put cancer viruses in vaccines and also I've
[02:57:03.640 --> 02:57:07.880]  pulled up some of the admissions of the CIA developing weaponized cancer so we'll
[02:57:07.880 --> 02:57:13.920]  go from rumor to fact tonight on the nightly news for those of you that are
[02:57:13.920 --> 02:57:17.600]  prison planet TV viewers and members and then by tomorrow or Saturday it'll be
[02:57:17.600 --> 02:57:21.280]  dispersed from everybody else you finance this operation and the tens of
[02:57:21.280 --> 02:57:24.880]  millions we reach those of you that are prison planet TV members we couldn't do
[02:57:24.880 --> 02:57:28.200]  it without you and I couldn't do it without the amazing in full wars crew
[02:57:28.200 --> 02:57:32.920]  please pray for us it wouldn't be alive it wasn't for your prayers and our
[02:57:32.920 --> 02:57:37.760]  guardian angels please pray for the crew and pray that America and the rest of
[02:57:37.760 --> 02:57:41.720]  the world will awaken from this trance and face the evil that we're dealing
[02:57:41.720 --> 02:57:48.000]  with and if you don't believe in God at least reach out to people about this
[02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:51.760]  evil but I found it's people that do have a relationship with the creator that
[02:57:51.760 --> 02:57:56.080]  do tend to care I don't have all those fake churchgoers that are just there
[02:57:56.080 --> 02:57:59.520]  praising the end of the world as I get their emails praise God it's getting so
[02:57:59.520 --> 02:58:03.880]  evil that means the end of the world's coming soon this is great yeah yeah sure
[02:58:03.880 --> 02:58:08.560]  it is the same groups always think it's the end of the world and never stand up
[02:58:08.560 --> 02:58:12.720]  and fight corruption because they want to sit there on their romps sucking their
[02:58:12.720 --> 02:58:19.720]  thumbs like a some kind of ostrich creature all right again we're about to
[02:58:19.720 --> 02:58:23.440]  close out 2011 I'll be back live tomorrow I'm still debating I'm gonna be
