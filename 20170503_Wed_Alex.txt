[00:00:12.023 --> 00:00:18.631]  It's time for the big kickoff of the 30-hour global transmission against tyranny in defense of free speech and the West.
[00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:20.153]  It's 11 a.m.
[00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:27.521]  Central Standard Time from the Infowars News Centers in Austin, Texas on Wednesday, May 3rd, 2017.
[00:00:27.521 --> 00:00:31.346]  Start your engines and get ready to rumble!
[00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:34.189]  We are the resistance.
[00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:38.593]  We stand against globalism and worldwide unelected corporate tyranny.
[00:00:38.593 --> 00:00:41.035]  We stand for free market capitalism.
[00:00:41.035 --> 00:00:42.796]  We stand for religious freedom.
[00:00:42.796 --> 00:00:44.418]  We stand for sovereignty.
[00:00:44.418 --> 00:00:45.819]  We stand for the family.
[00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:48.301]  We stand for the individual right to self-defense.
[00:00:48.301 --> 00:00:54.666]  We stand in defense of the Renaissance and the West as it is under massive, globalist, sustained siege.
[00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:55.827]  We are the Infowar.
[00:01:02.517 --> 00:01:11.493]  Wednesday, already the third day of May 2017, as the enemy media attacks us at record levels.
[00:01:11.493 --> 00:01:13.718]  It's only intensified.
[00:01:13.718 --> 00:01:14.820]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:01:16.698 --> 00:01:18.559]  We'll be here for the next 30 hours.
[00:01:18.559 --> 00:01:27.826]  In fact, I left my list in my little office over there of all the guest hosts, all the guests that are going to be joining us coming up in just the next few hours.
[00:01:27.826 --> 00:01:41.136]  Dr. Ron Paul, Dr. Jerome Corsi with Huge Breaking News, Dr. Edward Group, Katherine Austin-Fitz, banking expert from the Clinton administration, Mike Cernovich, and so much more today.
[00:01:42.295 --> 00:01:43.676]  I'll be going over the big list.
[00:01:43.676 --> 00:01:49.681]  Infowars.com forward slash show has the 30 hour feed that we just kicked off a minute and a half ago.
[00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:54.205]  And you can also share that feed to Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:01:54.205 --> 00:02:01.351]  That's what this is really all about is defeating their technocracy, defeating their bots, defeating their computers.
[00:02:01.351 --> 00:02:03.613]  They claim that we've got Russian bots.
[00:02:03.613 --> 00:02:04.894]  What a load of malarkey.
[00:02:04.894 --> 00:02:07.376]  We have the American people and the people of the world.
[00:02:08.353 --> 00:02:09.933]  I don't want to expose globalism.
[00:02:09.933 --> 00:02:13.814]  I've got this to say, Trump is really going off his trajectory more and more.
[00:02:13.814 --> 00:02:21.976]  Even Limbaugh came out, I'm going to play the clip coming up, and said, we sent you to drain the swamp.
[00:02:21.976 --> 00:02:26.897]  And you're not quite doing that with this new spending bill and a few other things you're doing.
[00:02:26.897 --> 00:02:28.117]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:02:28.117 --> 00:02:31.638]  Trump is draining the swamp.
[00:02:31.638 --> 00:02:32.958]  But it's like it's a video game.
[00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:36.259]  He's like fighting the big crime boss at the end of the level.
[00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:41.198]  And the power level of the boss is going down.
[00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.912]  But as Trump battles the globalist, he's looking into the eyes of the devil.
[00:02:47.912 --> 00:02:50.253]  He is slowly becoming them.
[00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:54.495]  So he's doing all these great things, but at first he was 100% the first 30 days.
[00:02:54.495 --> 00:02:56.096]  Then 60 days later, he was at 98%.
[00:02:56.096 --> 00:02:57.097]  Then 70 days later, it was at 95%.
[00:02:57.097 --> 00:02:58.137]  And then now he's at like 70%.
[00:02:58.137 --> 00:02:59.178]  Hell, he was at like 80% a few days ago.
[00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:00.058]  Trump is unraveling quickly.
[00:03:00.058 --> 00:03:01.579]  I will just tell you that.
[00:03:10.097 --> 00:03:11.258]  And I think everybody can see it.
[00:03:11.258 --> 00:03:13.619]  Now, he wouldn't have done all the things he did if he wasn't for real.
[00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:16.020]  These are devastating blows.
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.702]  Devastating blows against the globalists.
[00:03:18.702 --> 00:03:20.023]  These are real things.
[00:03:20.023 --> 00:03:36.352]  Declaring sovereignty, getting big banks to loan to small businesses, killing TPP, making better trade deals with China, Mexico, beginning to build the wall, even though the funding's not there, but not killing Obamacare when they had the conservative votes, bringing up that
[00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:42.481]  Watered down version, well wasn't as bad as Obamacare, but wasn't what he promised.
[00:03:42.481 --> 00:03:47.786]  This new spending bill that doesn't have the money for the wall, and increases a bunch of Democratic programs.
[00:03:47.786 --> 00:03:49.047]  I understand he's got a compromise.
[00:03:49.047 --> 00:03:51.609]  I understand they want to shut down the government and blame him.
[00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.812]  I get what Trump's doing.
[00:03:54.812 --> 00:04:02.638]  But the purest vision of Trump and Stephen Bannon since Bannon 72 days ago, or 72 days in,
[00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:13.099]  36 days ago or so, or whatever it was, 70-something days in, when Bannon got demoted, he really got demoted.
[00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:18.364]  And you can really see that behind the scenes with this whiteboard that had all their goals and all their ideas and all their strategies.
[00:04:19.315 --> 00:04:23.598]  It's now gotten leaked because he posed with a staffer in front of the whiteboard, not meaning for it to get out.
[00:04:23.598 --> 00:04:25.039]  That's out in the news today.
[00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.661]  You look at what's on that whiteboard, that's what they did.
[00:04:27.661 --> 00:04:30.724]  In just 70 days, Trump over-delivered.
[00:04:30.724 --> 00:04:31.905]  It was beautiful.
[00:04:31.905 --> 00:04:33.666]  Yeah, that story's up on drivesreport.com.
[00:04:33.666 --> 00:04:36.388]  Bannon planning whiteboard accidentally revealed.
[00:04:36.388 --> 00:04:40.892]  Let's tweet that out right now at Real Alex Jones, so people can see that image.
[00:04:40.892 --> 00:04:43.193]  It's out of the Telegraph today.
[00:04:43.193 --> 00:04:45.075]  Show, it's all coming up.
[00:04:46.092 --> 00:04:49.955]  They want to try to censor M4s, they want to try to block us on Google, they want to try to do all this.
[00:04:49.955 --> 00:04:52.597]  They can't stop you spreading the articles, the videos.
[00:04:52.597 --> 00:04:56.520]  They can't stop you spreading the word about local MNFM stations.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:04.626]  Get ready, we've got so much news to cover on North Korea, the economy, Hillary Clinton, the FBI, the Director testifying, and so much more.
[00:05:06.374 --> 00:05:12.480]  Prepping for disaster and societal unrest has now gone so mainstream that even Realtor.com is writing about it.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:21.730]  But the Realtors are still embarrassed to cover the subject and eager to set themselves apart from what they call Uncle Travis' guns and canned foods militia vision of preparedness.
[00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.072]  Well, the ants may have the last laugh
[00:05:24.272 --> 00:05:25.453]  On the grasshoppers.
[00:05:25.453 --> 00:05:28.694]  But the grasshoppers will still sing the tune if they can make money.
[00:05:28.694 --> 00:05:35.377]  But maybe you don't have a Hollywood mansion where you can drop another million dollars to turn your home theater into a radiation-proof bunker.
[00:05:35.377 --> 00:05:39.859]  There are still very effective, low-tech, low-cost things you can do to prepare.
[00:05:39.859 --> 00:05:47.283]  In fact, even realizing that there's a need to prepare and doing anything to act on that realization increases your chances of survival.
[00:05:47.643 --> 00:05:56.106]  Things that you do to prepare for an Armageddon scenario will help you to weather storms, to absorb an economic shock, or to protect you from home invasion.
[00:05:56.106 --> 00:06:02.089]  Prepare for the worst-case scenario while you educate yourself and others and work for the best-case scenario.
[00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:04.970]  Get more information at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:05.510]  I'm David Knight.
[00:06:06.482 --> 00:06:08.323]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:06:08.323 --> 00:06:14.926]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:06:14.926 --> 00:06:18.087]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:18.087 --> 00:06:27.871]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:06:27.871 --> 00:06:28.712]  Caveman.
[00:06:28.712 --> 00:06:33.774]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:06:33.774 --> 00:06:35.895]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:39.336]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:06:39.336 --> 00:06:44.478]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:06:44.478 --> 00:06:52.621]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:06:52.621 --> 00:07:00.564]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:07:00.564 --> 00:07:05.226]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself in 4WarsLife.com today.

[00:07:40.615 --> 00:07:45.341]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.

[00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:54.334]  But it also assists with many other functions of the body.

[00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:27.241]  We came, you saw, you died.
[00:08:27.241 --> 00:08:30.507]  We came, you saw, you died.
[00:09:02.505 --> 00:09:04.251]  It's not a laughing matter.
[00:09:04.251 --> 00:09:05.976]  I take it really seriously.
[00:09:14.574 --> 00:09:29.637]  A woman running to be the first woman president.
[00:09:29.637 --> 00:09:33.437]  I cannot imagine anyone being more of an outsider than the first woman president.
[00:09:33.437 --> 00:09:35.218]  Who can be more of an outsider than a woman president?
[00:09:35.218 --> 00:09:39.359]  Well, I can't think of anything more of an outsider than electing the first woman president.
[00:09:39.359 --> 00:09:42.119]  A woman president of the United States of America!
[00:09:46.959 --> 00:09:57.806]  Occasionally we have to bring the Gorgon back from her crypt to just remind everybody the Medusa-like creature that we dodged
[00:10:14.639 --> 00:10:15.900]  Last year on November 8th.
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.742]  Does that mean Donald Trump's perfect?
[00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:18.382]  Absolutely not.
[00:10:18.382 --> 00:10:21.065]  Does that mean we won't hold his feet to the fire?
[00:10:21.065 --> 00:10:22.846]  Absolutely we will.
[00:10:22.846 --> 00:10:24.168]  But Trump's done a lot of good.
[00:10:24.168 --> 00:10:26.850]  He's also starting to do some pretty bad stuff.
[00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.872]  And I expected this earlier, actually.
[00:10:28.872 --> 00:10:33.196]  I said if he got 30-40% done when he claimed he did, that he'd be legendary.
[00:10:33.196 --> 00:10:35.017]  He's already pretty much gotten that done.
[00:10:35.017 --> 00:10:36.198]  He's gotten so much done.
[00:10:36.198 --> 00:10:38.260]  But it's still sad.
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.823]  And quite frankly, even more painful.
[00:10:41.974 --> 00:10:55.919]  To try to figure out how he could be so good and do so much good for the average person and for national sovereignty and so much to expose political correctness and the United Nations and globalism and then start going sideways.
[00:10:55.919 --> 00:11:03.821]  It makes it even worse at a cellular gut level, doesn't it?
[00:11:03.821 --> 00:11:05.622]  I kicked off today with Hillary Clinton.
[00:11:07.881 --> 00:11:10.321]  Because she's all over the news, obviously.
[00:11:10.321 --> 00:11:12.462]  Blaming Comey that she didn't win.
[00:11:12.462 --> 00:11:16.983]  Comey completely covered up Hillary's crimes and did nothing to stop her.
[00:11:16.983 --> 00:11:23.484]  When she openly had 30-something thousand illegal emails on the illegal server and got money from the Russians and the Chinese.
[00:11:23.484 --> 00:11:24.804]  I mean, it's a joke.
[00:11:24.804 --> 00:11:28.385]  The Clintons have been protected for 30 plus years.
[00:11:28.385 --> 00:11:33.606]  And then she turns around and says she lost because of Comey.
[00:11:33.606 --> 00:11:36.087]  She almost won because of Comey.
[00:11:36.087 --> 00:11:37.607]  And Loretta Lynch and all the rest of it.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:45.902]  And then she says in interviews yesterday that she lost because she was a woman.
[00:11:45.902 --> 00:11:47.703]  I thought she was going to win because she was a woman.
[00:11:47.703 --> 00:11:49.463]  It had nothing to do with it.
[00:11:49.463 --> 00:11:58.406]  Men are overwhelmingly reportedly going to vote for Le Pen in France because they like her policies of sovereignty and French culture and lower taxes.
[00:11:59.912 --> 00:12:07.196]  Comey's testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee right now and we'll be breaking down some of the highlights of that as it unfolds here today at 12-12 Eastern, 11-12 Central.
[00:12:12.537 --> 00:12:21.121]  But also, Comey has now said that classified Clinton emails were forwarded to Anthony Weiner and Uma Abedin, which we already knew and reported last year.
[00:12:21.121 --> 00:12:28.144]  But here it is, new Uma Abedin emails revealed 29 previously undisclosed Clinton emails with classified information.
[00:12:28.144 --> 00:12:32.686]  Hillary said first her emails were never hacked, then she said there was no classified info.
[00:12:32.686 --> 00:12:34.687]  Liar, liar.
[00:12:34.687 --> 00:12:35.748]  But it's okay, as long as
[00:12:36.755 --> 00:12:44.740]  She wears a Mao Zedong, you know, Chinese-style communist outfit like she always does, and walks around with her Islamic girlfriend.
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.641]  Everything's fine.
[00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:51.304]  Hillary Clinton, I was on the way to winning until Comey and Russian WikiLeaks.
[00:12:51.304 --> 00:12:52.365]  Yes.
[00:12:52.365 --> 00:12:54.847]  Yes, the Russians released your crimes.
[00:12:54.847 --> 00:12:57.408]  The Russians weren't the WikiLeaks people on that.
[00:12:57.408 --> 00:12:58.389]  It was the CIA.
[00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:59.029]  It was the Pentagon.
[00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:00.330]  Everybody knows that.
[00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:00.851]  It was U.S.
[00:13:00.851 --> 00:13:01.251]  leakers.
[00:13:01.251 --> 00:13:03.252]  British ambassadors have gone public.
[00:13:03.252 --> 00:13:05.914]  Our sources have gone public about the fact that they know the sources.
[00:13:07.162 --> 00:13:22.510]  But it's the Russians, they're the reason we didn't want an old, evil, twisted maven of corruption and oppression and evil, who cackles like a witch.
[00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.431]  So let's go ahead and start going through some of these clips.
[00:13:25.431 --> 00:13:30.314]  Here's Hillary Clinton, includes herself as part of the resistance.
[00:13:30.314 --> 00:13:34.876]  Ever since they lost in November of last year, seven months ago,
[00:13:36.835 --> 00:13:43.562]  They have been calling themselves the Resistance.
[00:13:43.562 --> 00:13:45.144]  I'm Stephen Colbert.
[00:13:45.144 --> 00:13:48.448]  And if you're watching this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[00:13:48.448 --> 00:13:49.769]  I'm Keith Oberman.
[00:13:49.769 --> 00:13:50.690]  Russian scum!
[00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:51.671]  Russian scum!
[00:13:51.671 --> 00:13:53.133]  By the way, I'm Keith Oberman.
[00:13:53.133 --> 00:13:55.315]  I'm the Resistance against the Russian takeover.
[00:13:58.479 --> 00:14:05.943]  That's what the establishment calls themselves is the resistance now, because they're the globalists that have hijacked the government, taken over.
[00:14:05.943 --> 00:14:11.925]  Trump was a beachhead of the resistance, a manifestation of how strong the nationalistic awakening is.
[00:14:11.925 --> 00:14:27.293]  Whether he is totally real, goes sideways, or turns on us, which I don't think he'll do, doesn't matter in the final equation, because we've gone from being obscure, in the closet, demonized, the red-headed stepchild, to
[00:14:29.807 --> 00:14:36.690]  The paramount, fastest-growing global movement in the world against unelected, worldwide tyranny known as globalism.
[00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.051]  So think about how the Federal Reserve is exposed.
[00:14:39.051 --> 00:14:45.814]  How they've got to have a Federal Reserve of New York board members sue me with the law firm started by George Soros.
[00:14:45.814 --> 00:14:48.054]  Can't make that up.
[00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:54.097]  Oh, they're not laughing now at Nigel Farage, or Marie Le Pen, or Ron Paul, or Alex Jones, or Matt Drudge.
[00:14:58.413 --> 00:15:05.378]  And it's the Matt Drudges and the Alex Joneses and the Jerome Corsis and the Pat Buchanans.
[00:15:05.378 --> 00:15:06.659]  We're not giving credit here.
[00:15:06.659 --> 00:15:18.987]  We're scientifically, historically laying out, and where we came from nothing, but with the truth, going back to Barry Goldwater and Phyllis Schlafly, 60, 70 years ago.
[00:15:18.987 --> 00:15:22.990]  Phyllis Schlafly just died a month or so ago at what, 97 years old?
[00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:26.953]  She was fighting when she was 25 years old as a young law graduate.
[00:15:28.134 --> 00:15:29.795]  Talk about breaking the glass ceilings.
[00:15:29.795 --> 00:15:31.817]  That lady did it.
[00:15:31.817 --> 00:15:37.280]  And then led the Americana movement after Barry Goldwater's death.
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.761]  So we stand on their shoulders.
[00:15:38.761 --> 00:15:41.423]  They were the first wave in the modern wave of reawakening.
[00:15:41.423 --> 00:15:44.925]  Then, the Ron Polls and the Ronald Reagans were the second wave.
[00:15:44.925 --> 00:15:48.008]  Didn't mean they were perfect, but they were the opposition to globalism.
[00:15:48.008 --> 00:15:49.909]  They kept the flame alive.
[00:15:49.909 --> 00:15:52.391]  Showed what real prosperity was in free market.
[00:15:52.391 --> 00:15:54.272]  Then you come into the third wave.
[00:15:54.272 --> 00:15:55.593]  Matt Drudge, Alex Jones.
[00:15:57.534 --> 00:16:01.115]  And then you come into the fourth wave.
[00:16:01.115 --> 00:16:04.636]  Le Pen, whose dad was first wave.
[00:16:04.636 --> 00:16:06.296]  She's in the third wave.
[00:16:06.296 --> 00:16:11.378]  And Donald Trump's.
[00:16:11.378 --> 00:16:13.578]  The Nigel Farage's.
[00:16:13.578 --> 00:16:17.239]  He's been around 20-something years, but he really peaked now in this third wave.
[00:16:17.239 --> 00:16:20.120]  And then the fourth wave.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.901]  It's a very, very, very exciting time to be part of this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:24.577 --> 00:16:31.639]  I sat around as a child and heard my dad and his friends talk about everything that later happened.
[00:16:31.639 --> 00:16:34.539]  And how we should form a resistance against it and get the truth out.
[00:16:34.539 --> 00:16:37.500]  Because a tyranny like this would never succeed if we were there exposing it.
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.340]  And it happened.
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:43.021]  And now Hillary has the nerve to call herself the resistance.
[00:16:43.021 --> 00:16:46.462]  I guess they are the globalist resistance to humanity awakening.
[00:16:46.462 --> 00:16:46.942]  Here's Hillary.
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.142]  I can't be anything other than who I am.
[00:16:52.142 --> 00:17:01.510]  And I spent decades learning about what it would take to move our country forward, including people who, you know, clearly didn't vote for me.
[00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:18.343]  To try to make sure that we dealt with a lot of these hard issues that are right around the corner, like robotics and artificial intelligence, and things that are really going to be upending the economy for the vast majority of Americans, to say nothing of the rest of the world.
[00:17:19.624 --> 00:17:27.829]  You know, I'm now back to being an activist citizen and part of the resistance.
[00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:28.510]  Yay!
[00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:31.712]  The globalists have decided to build a future where people aren't needed.
[00:17:31.712 --> 00:17:34.293]  They've written the white papers, the books, it's all out there.
[00:17:34.293 --> 00:17:42.599]  We're ugly, we're bad, kill the public, get the freeway moving, a la... Bill Maher.
[00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:46.751]  A la Bill Nye, the science guy.
[00:17:46.751 --> 00:17:48.252]  Don't have more than one kid.
[00:17:48.252 --> 00:17:50.413]  Have a super state that controls you.
[00:17:50.413 --> 00:18:02.560]  And then Hillary, who's given awards to China, been part of the UN Women's Group, who pushes the robotics replacing us, who pushes a system of not having a future for humanity, of cutting our resources off.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:07.843]  Her and Bill Gates and others are now warning you about the technocracy that's about to make you obsolete.
[00:18:09.585 --> 00:18:11.506]  Because the technocrats have decided to do that.
[00:18:11.506 --> 00:18:25.977]  If we keep voting with our dollars, and don't go along with these systems, and don't go along with the smart homes, and don't go along with the surveillance grid, and don't go along with the Amazons of the world, the Amazon.com's, then their program is dead on arrival.
[00:18:25.977 --> 00:18:35.485]  That's why globalism is falling right now, and they're pivoting, trying to act like they're the anti-globalists in some cases, to try to somehow control the opposition.
[00:18:35.485 --> 00:18:37.126]  And some people could argue that's what
[00:18:39.036 --> 00:18:40.837]  President Trump is.
[00:18:40.837 --> 00:18:42.158]  Trump believed in it.
[00:18:42.158 --> 00:18:43.158]  He believes in America.
[00:18:43.158 --> 00:18:43.979]  He wants it.
[00:18:43.979 --> 00:18:47.741]  But he's got people in there trying to co-opt him right now.
[00:18:47.741 --> 00:18:49.882]  And I'm not lionizing Trump saying he's perfect.
[00:18:49.882 --> 00:18:52.424]  He wouldn't have done the things he did if he wasn't for real.
[00:18:52.424 --> 00:18:54.525]  They were coffin nails to this.
[00:18:54.525 --> 00:18:59.348]  But his course, 35 days ago when Bannon got demoted, basically sidelined,
[00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:05.192]  Has started going off to the side, and it's deteriorating quickly.
[00:19:05.192 --> 00:19:09.356]  So we're going to play clips of Limbaugh saying, hey, drain the swamp.
[00:19:09.356 --> 00:19:12.438]  When Vice President Pence was on here yesterday, we've got a bunch of other clips.
[00:19:12.438 --> 00:19:16.421]  We've got Joe Biden saying Hillary lost because she's a woman.
[00:19:16.421 --> 00:19:20.705]  Record numbers of women voted for Donald Trump, and you know that.
[00:19:20.705 --> 00:19:24.488]  This has nothing to do with what is between somebody's legs.
[00:19:24.488 --> 00:19:25.829]  It's what's between their ears.
[00:19:27.608 --> 00:19:38.079]  And it shows the arrogance and the bravado and the hubris of the elite to try to sell a drugged out evil crone with all of her evil record on the American people.
[00:19:38.079 --> 00:19:39.821]  It's like they tried to sell Bush.
[00:19:39.821 --> 00:19:42.984]  Jeb Bush was the number one guy of the Republican establishment, Bush.
[00:19:42.984 --> 00:19:43.725]  Don't you get it?
[00:19:43.725 --> 00:19:45.206]  We don't want these
[00:19:46.387 --> 00:19:47.588]  Operatives anymore.
[00:19:47.588 --> 00:19:49.490]  And if Trump isn't perfect, doesn't matter.
[00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:52.872]  We still went for the package labeled Patriot.
[00:19:52.872 --> 00:19:54.333]  Labeled Renaissance.
[00:19:54.333 --> 00:19:56.074]  Labeled Nationalism.
[00:19:56.074 --> 00:20:01.458]  And it shows the awakening and it's a very positive thing in a very, very negative world.
[00:20:01.458 --> 00:20:02.259]  We'll be back.
[00:20:02.259 --> 00:20:04.461]  The 30-hour special transmission has now launched.
[00:20:06.438 --> 00:20:07.699]  Maybe not today.
[00:20:07.699 --> 00:20:08.980]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:12.722]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[00:20:12.722 --> 00:20:13.802]  Forget bunkers.
[00:20:13.802 --> 00:20:15.643]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[00:20:15.643 --> 00:20:17.344]  You need Survivalist Camps.
[00:20:17.344 --> 00:20:25.148]  The ultimate, fully functional, off-the-grid, mobile survival bug-out house that's well-equipped and custom-built to outlast any other RV or trailer.
[00:20:25.148 --> 00:20:26.149]  Bold statement?
[00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:27.149]  You bet.
[00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:29.631]  See them now at survivalistcamps.com.
[00:20:29.631 --> 00:20:31.852]  That's survivalistcamps.com.

[00:20:35.954 --> 00:20:38.795]  Many books have been written regarding the Law of Attraction.
[00:20:38.795 --> 00:20:45.298]  But what if all these books are missing the most important information we can use when it comes to activating this law in our lives?
[00:20:45.298 --> 00:20:55.703]  The new book, It's Time to Align, the most powerful self-help book ever written by Alan Lautinger, takes a look at how the Law of Attraction really works and how it is being suppressed in our lives.
[00:20:55.703 --> 00:21:01.385]  Learn how to overcome this manipulation and how to experience alignment with the creative power of the universe.
[00:21:01.385 --> 00:21:04.867]  Get the new book, It's Time to Align, available at Amazon.com.
[00:21:06.041 --> 00:21:07.862]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:21:07.862 --> 00:21:14.445]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:21:14.445 --> 00:21:17.587]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[00:21:17.587 --> 00:21:27.311]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:21:27.311 --> 00:21:28.172]  Caveman.
[00:21:28.172 --> 00:21:33.214]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:21:33.214 --> 00:21:35.315]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:21:35.615 --> 00:21:38.756]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:21:38.756 --> 00:21:43.857]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:21:43.857 --> 00:21:51.979]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:21:51.979 --> 00:21:59.882]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:21:59.882 --> 00:22:04.523]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself in 4WarsLife.com today.

[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:40.081]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[00:22:40.081 --> 00:22:45.783]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.

[00:24:00.027 --> 00:24:03.070]  That's ProFlowers.com secret code 1616.
[00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:08.215]  It wasn't a perfect campaign.
[00:24:09.176 --> 00:24:12.238]  There is no such thing.
[00:24:12.238 --> 00:24:28.468]  But I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28th and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me but got scared off.
[00:24:28.468 --> 00:24:30.209]  And the evidence for that
[00:24:31.832 --> 00:24:39.717]  intervening event is, I think, compelling, persuasive.
[00:24:39.717 --> 00:24:42.839]  And so we overcame a lot in the campaign.
[00:24:42.839 --> 00:24:48.083]  We overcame an enormous barrage of negativity.
[00:24:51.505 --> 00:25:04.914]  Um, but, as Nate Silver, uh, the former Community Independent, uh, Analyst, but one that's, uh, also reliable, you know, has concluded, you know, if the election had been on October 27th, I'd be your president.
[00:25:04.914 --> 00:25:05.474]  And it wasn't.
[00:25:05.474 --> 00:25:09.557]  It was on October 28th, and there was just a lot of funny business going on around that.
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:25.023]  Thank you so much for joining us today during the 30-hour global transmission we just kicked off.
[00:25:25.023 --> 00:25:32.327]  What an incredible sore loser we just witnessed in Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[00:25:32.327 --> 00:25:34.849]  They were rigging the debates.
[00:25:34.849 --> 00:25:36.950]  They were rigging the questions.
[00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:38.171]  They were manipulating the media.
[00:25:38.171 --> 00:25:40.112]  It's in thousands of the WikiLeaks.
[00:25:40.112 --> 00:25:42.954]  They were trying to keep us desperate in the dark needing them.
[00:25:46.055 --> 00:25:47.456]  They were doing all of this.
[00:25:47.456 --> 00:25:49.537]  They had the whole system fixed.
[00:25:49.537 --> 00:25:50.958]  They were trying to steal the election.
[00:25:50.958 --> 00:25:52.899]  They did in at least five states.
[00:25:52.899 --> 00:25:54.180]  Massive evidence of that.
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.662]  Tried to break into computers and six others.
[00:25:56.662 --> 00:25:59.023]  But they failed!
[00:25:59.023 --> 00:26:03.686]  They had polls on average adding 15 points more to Hillary.
[00:26:03.686 --> 00:26:05.707]  So that she looked like a winner.
[00:26:05.707 --> 00:26:10.490]  CNN in some polls added over 30%.
[00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:13.432]  Trump won in a giant landslide.
[00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:29.152]  So let's just remember, as we see Trump begin to waffle some, that we should hold his feet to the fire and be very, very aggressive about it.
[00:26:29.152 --> 00:26:34.714]  But we had a victory in Trump, and we had a major victory in nationalism.
[00:26:34.714 --> 00:26:45.056]  Now, I've got some other Hillary Clinton clips I want to play, but coming up in the next segment, this is all over CNBC, it's all over the Wall Street Journal, it's all over the New York Times.
[00:26:45.056 --> 00:26:46.876]  Some of them even give us credit.
[00:26:48.456 --> 00:26:55.418]  Well, they want to say we're fake news because they're scared of us, because they know we can force big stories out.
[00:26:55.418 --> 00:27:02.599]  One of Corsi's White House sources, and I don't even know his sources, but they're very good.
[00:27:02.599 --> 00:27:04.760]  Here it is.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.720]  From Market Watch and Fox Business.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:11.062]  Munition on Fannie and Freddie Mae funds used to pay for Obamacare.
[00:27:11.062 --> 00:27:12.182]  It's true.
[00:27:12.182 --> 00:27:14.062]  We broke this.
[00:27:14.062 --> 00:27:16.563]  This broke on May 1st, two days ago.
[00:27:17.995 --> 00:27:18.615]  It's May 3rd today.
[00:27:18.615 --> 00:27:21.436]  Everybody started pointing this out to me yesterday.
[00:27:21.436 --> 00:27:23.357]  Did you know the news gave you credit?
[00:27:23.357 --> 00:27:25.438]  Here's Dr. Corsi's article from yesterday.
[00:27:25.438 --> 00:27:34.322]  Treasury Secretary confirms Infowars.com reporting on Obama theft of Fannie and Freddie May, close to $300 billion we know of.
[00:27:34.322 --> 00:27:37.783]  That's just the documents that have been released from four years of Obama.
[00:27:37.783 --> 00:27:39.604]  They still haven't released the others.
[00:27:39.604 --> 00:27:43.926]  Corsi got these through lawsuits that the White House directed into by private companies.
[00:27:45.302 --> 00:27:48.283]  Here it is, Fannie Freddie profit payments should continue.
[00:27:48.283 --> 00:27:50.303]  Treasury says, oh.
[00:27:50.303 --> 00:27:53.424]  And here's the original article we put out.
[00:27:53.424 --> 00:27:56.265]  February 27th.
[00:27:56.265 --> 00:27:58.046]  That's two months ago.
[00:27:58.046 --> 00:27:58.786]  Exclusive!
[00:27:58.786 --> 00:28:03.027]  Obama literally robbed Fannie Freddie to fund Obamacare.
[00:28:03.027 --> 00:28:06.648]  Exclusive!
[00:28:06.648 --> 00:28:10.209]  Just like we told you last week that they had a big meeting on Friday.
[00:28:12.475 --> 00:28:22.847]  Morning at the White House with McMaster, the National Security Advisor, saying he wants to increase troops in Afghanistan and boost it up to 30 plus billion, and that all broke on Bloomberg on Monday.
[00:28:25.848 --> 00:28:30.931]  And the Soros Group put out its articles for Media Matters saying, find the leak and shut it down.
[00:28:30.931 --> 00:28:36.034]  And I got to correct something, because I saw the show today, and I kind of conflate things, not on purpose, but I talk fast.
[00:28:36.034 --> 00:28:39.016]  I got guests coming up, I mix things together.
[00:28:39.016 --> 00:28:40.657]  Cernovich has a bunch of sources.
[00:28:40.657 --> 00:28:42.478]  I know that Don Jr.
[00:28:42.478 --> 00:28:44.179]  says he shouldn't be giving the Pulitzer Prize.
[00:28:44.179 --> 00:28:44.900]  I agree he should.
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:48.402]  So should Paul Watson, Dr. Corsi, and many others.
[00:28:48.402 --> 00:28:51.324]  If it was a real prize, instead of, you know, giving it to Globalist.
[00:28:53.095 --> 00:28:57.196]  And that he's a great source of info on what he says.
[00:28:57.196 --> 00:28:59.017]  He is not Cernovich's source.
[00:28:59.017 --> 00:29:02.017]  I happen to know one of the sources he has that's in the White House.
[00:29:02.017 --> 00:29:03.298]  It's not Don Jr.'s.
[00:29:03.298 --> 00:29:04.498]  It'll become a big investigation.
[00:29:04.498 --> 00:29:05.518]  Stop Don Jr.
[00:29:05.518 --> 00:29:06.839]  from leaking information.
[00:29:06.839 --> 00:29:09.239]  And I kind of conflated those two.
[00:29:09.239 --> 00:29:11.200]  My point is the two, you know, obviously
[00:29:12.458 --> 00:29:14.019]  Like each other, I'll just leave it at that.
[00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:36.853]  You know, of course, he's got three number one New York Times bestseller books.
[00:29:36.853 --> 00:29:42.357]  He's probably changed the course of at least one election, probably two, with his Swift Boat book.
[00:29:42.357 --> 00:29:45.980]  And he's got a PhD in banking and is willing to expose all this.
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.601]  So another big giant story we broke.
[00:29:47.601 --> 00:29:48.222]  That's coming up.
[00:29:48.222 --> 00:29:49.303]  Then Ron Paul.
[00:29:49.303 --> 00:29:55.287]  Stay with us.
[00:29:55.287 --> 00:29:56.689]  We're on the march.
[00:29:56.689 --> 00:29:59.211]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:59.211 --> 00:30:01.913]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:06.365 --> 00:30:16.815]  It was Thomas Jefferson who once said that our country is now taking such steady a course as to show by what road it will pass to destruction to wit, by consolidation of power first and then corruption its necessary consequence.
[00:30:16.815 --> 00:30:24.202]  Jefferson was warning us about the global elite, the 1% of the 1%, consolidating the world's wealth and subverting the people's voice in government.
[00:30:24.202 --> 00:30:26.163]  Unfortunately, we didn't heed his advice.
[00:30:26.163 --> 00:30:32.209]  We now live in a neo-feudalistic society in which we're treated as indentured servants who only exist to serve the needs of the establishment.
[00:30:32.409 --> 00:30:39.913]  Political office no longer represents the voice of the people, but rather the initiation process politicians go through to gain acceptance into the aristocracy.
[00:30:39.913 --> 00:30:47.737]  Simply put, we the people are responsible for civilization and culture, yet we're suppressed by a tiny elite who have organized into criminal gangs that operate governments around the world.
[00:30:47.737 --> 00:30:56.022]  We falsely believe that everything is simply black and white, one extreme against the other, conservative versus liberal, but things will change once more of us realize this truth.
[00:30:56.022 --> 00:31:02.005]  As Thomas Jefferson also said, enlighten the people generally, and tyranny and oppressions of the body and mind will vanish like evil
[00:31:02.005 --> 00:31:02.505]  I think so.
[00:31:23.985 --> 00:31:24.746]  And the best part?
[00:31:24.746 --> 00:31:27.607]  You'll be helping your friends and family along the way.

[00:32:03.114 --> 00:32:04.415]  Check it out for yourself today.
[00:32:05.991 --> 00:32:11.454]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:32:11.454 --> 00:32:13.555]  Research across the board is clear.
[00:32:13.555 --> 00:32:18.837]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:32:18.837 --> 00:32:22.599]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that
[00:32:22.699 --> 00:32:26.141]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[00:32:26.141 --> 00:32:29.323]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[00:32:29.323 --> 00:32:33.205]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[00:32:33.205 --> 00:32:40.370]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:45.753]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[00:32:45.933 --> 00:32:46.774]  We're good to go.
[00:33:10.083 --> 00:33:12.346]  This is the defense of the West.
[00:33:12.346 --> 00:33:14.568]  This is the defense of free speech.
[00:33:14.568 --> 00:33:17.752]  This is the defense of capitalism and free market.
[00:33:17.752 --> 00:33:24.459]  This is the defense of freedom, of prosperity, and the human spirit that refuses to submit.
[00:33:24.459 --> 00:33:29.024]  Coming up in the order they will appear in the next 30 hours of this historic broadcast.
[00:33:29.705 --> 00:33:54.114]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, Dr. Ron Paul, Dr. Group, Catherine Austin-Fitz, Mike Cernovich, Craig Sawyer, Anthony Cumia, Roger Stone, Ben Garrison, Leanne McAdoo, Samantha Scarlett, Lionel, Gerald Salente, Rob Duke, Michael Zimmerman, David Knight, John Rappaport, a huge roundtable discussion of journalists, surprise guests, and so much more.
[00:33:54.794 --> 00:34:06.145]  But most importantly, it's you the listeners, you the viewers, you the enemy of the globalists, who the New World Order hopes to shut down, hopes to gag, and hopes to silence.
[00:34:06.145 --> 00:34:11.330]  If you simply go to InfoWars.com and spread the link, InfoWars.com forward slash show,
[00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:19.316]  And spread our live YouTube and Facebook feeds, as well as tell friends, family, and neighbors about the local AM and FM stations you're listening on.
[00:34:19.316 --> 00:34:38.089]  We will gain millions of new listeners today during this special global transmission of mass human awakening and the overthrow of the new world order technotronic hell-bent globalist technocracy.
[00:34:38.089 --> 00:34:40.471]  Who is that voiceover man?
[00:34:43.812 --> 00:34:48.173]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:34:48.173 --> 00:35:03.377]  We're getting Dr. Jerome Corsi lined up on the Skype as we speak right now, investigative journalist, who broke a month ago that close to $300 billion just in the four years they were able to get into via our White House Treasury connections.
[00:35:03.377 --> 00:35:05.317]  Close to $300 billion.
[00:35:05.317 --> 00:35:08.958]  Now, we have only gotten a portion of the documents.
[00:35:08.958 --> 00:35:09.999]  It's probably gonna be a lot bigger.
[00:35:09.999 --> 00:35:10.779]  And then Mnuchin,
[00:35:11.836 --> 00:35:16.737]  The Treasury Secretary and others got asked about it on mainstream TV and they said, no, it's true.
[00:35:16.737 --> 00:35:18.538]  Infowars is right.
[00:35:18.538 --> 00:35:19.618]  Well, of course we're right.
[00:35:19.618 --> 00:35:22.539]  We got it from our sources.
[00:35:22.539 --> 00:35:25.699]  And of course he has a Harvard degree in finance.
[00:35:25.699 --> 00:35:28.020]  He's worked with Donald Trump.
[00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:29.760]  He's an expert.
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:30.701]  That's why they hate us.
[00:35:30.701 --> 00:35:35.742]  In fact, I've been told it's this story and bashing the radical Muslims that has them after me.
[00:35:35.742 --> 00:35:39.723]  They have the Federal Reserve of New York board member suing me right now.
[00:35:41.021 --> 00:35:45.082]  And I've been told, stop getting into Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac.
[00:35:45.082 --> 00:35:47.622]  Stop getting into the Muslims.
[00:35:47.622 --> 00:35:48.903]  Back off.
[00:35:48.903 --> 00:35:54.064]  Back off or you'll be destroyed.
[00:35:54.064 --> 00:35:57.504]  I'll tell you, it feels really good because it took him two months to get this stuff to break.
[00:35:57.504 --> 00:36:03.666]  And of course, he probably wrote seven articles on this.
[00:36:03.666 --> 00:36:04.386]  And I'd call him.
[00:36:04.386 --> 00:36:05.626]  He's our Washington bureau head.
[00:36:05.626 --> 00:36:06.786]  He's hiring folks right now.
[00:36:06.786 --> 00:36:10.307]  We've got our offices in just a block and a half away from the Capitol.
[00:36:11.454 --> 00:36:15.296]  Overlooking the Capitol and no one else will report this.
[00:36:15.296 --> 00:36:17.137]  They're too scared.
[00:36:17.137 --> 00:36:29.543]  People are too scared to report that McMaster was in there and prevailed with Trump last Friday to up troops in Afghanistan and spend hundreds of billions of dollars over the next four years on it.
[00:36:29.543 --> 00:36:31.384]  It's crazy.
[00:36:31.384 --> 00:36:33.846]  But we broke it with Cernovich and it was announced on Monday.
[00:36:34.901 --> 00:36:42.682]  So that's why they're so upset with us, that's why they're so angry with us, because we're going to tell you what's going on and we can't be bought off, we can't be intimidated.
[00:36:42.682 --> 00:36:58.925]  But I'll tell you, it's very paradoxical, best of times, worst of times, that I just love Trump and what he's doing on the economy and Americana and sovereignty and battling ISIS and bringing jobs back.
[00:36:58.925 --> 00:37:00.646]  I just get chills.
[00:37:00.646 --> 00:37:01.906]  And then it makes it worse.
[00:37:03.063 --> 00:37:07.105]  Because if you already hate somebody, they do bad stuff, it doesn't really hurt you, you just fight them.
[00:37:07.105 --> 00:37:20.093]  But when you really care about somebody, and you know what they're up against, you know they're getting threatened, you know they're surrounded, you know people aren't doing what he says, and then to see him start to capitulate and bring in globalists because they just weren't letting the government move.
[00:37:20.093 --> 00:37:23.154]  They had him in stalemate.
[00:37:23.154 --> 00:37:25.776]  They had him deadlocked.
[00:37:25.776 --> 00:37:29.238]  And so he's now dealing with them and getting us something, but giving up something.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:31.961]  People aren't going to put up with that.
[00:37:31.961 --> 00:37:35.884]  They expect stuff he can't deliver.
[00:37:35.884 --> 00:37:38.746]  Our listeners want me, a lot of them, to tear into Trump.
[00:37:38.746 --> 00:37:39.526]  I'm just being a realist.
[00:37:39.526 --> 00:37:42.849]  I'm not endorsing what he's done.
[00:37:42.849 --> 00:37:46.031]  But I'm not as quick as, you know, even Limbaugh to start tearing into him.
[00:37:46.031 --> 00:37:48.373]  Because even Limbaugh's listeners are upset.
[00:37:48.373 --> 00:37:50.034]  Limbaugh's saying, hey, we hired you to drain the swamp.
[00:37:50.034 --> 00:37:50.454]  What are you doing?
[00:37:50.454 --> 00:37:53.537]  What are you doing working with Paul Ryan?
[00:37:53.537 --> 00:37:57.820]  And it all started with 70, you know, day 70 or so with that health care bill they went along with.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:04.344]  So those videos are all up on InfoWars.com.
[00:38:04.344 --> 00:38:10.488]  I'm going to be playing some of those Limbaugh clips.
[00:38:10.488 --> 00:38:15.111]  Let's, you know, speak of the devil, let's go ahead and play a clip of Rush Limbaugh while we're getting Dr. Corsi on the line.
[00:38:15.111 --> 00:38:15.371]  Here it is.
[00:38:16.431 --> 00:38:20.215]  Why is the president now suggesting a budget shutdown in September or October?
[00:38:20.215 --> 00:38:23.077]  If it's no good now, why is it good then?
[00:38:23.077 --> 00:38:26.601]  You guys were sent there to drain the swamp.
[00:38:26.601 --> 00:38:29.884]  There's a clear Trump agenda that just isn't seeable.
[00:38:29.884 --> 00:38:33.307]  It's not visible in this budget.
[00:38:33.307 --> 00:38:39.613]  And some people are getting concerned that there's more concern for bipartisanship and crossing the aisle working with Democrats.
[00:38:41.054 --> 00:38:53.543]  Than there is in draining the swamp and actually peeling away all of the roughage that is preventing actually moving forward here on so many of these issues that affect people domestically.
[00:38:53.543 --> 00:38:58.087]  Yeah, but well, I think I think people look at look at the efforts of the last hundred days.
[00:38:58.087 --> 00:39:01.209]  I was with the president in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Saturday.
[00:39:01.209 --> 00:39:06.913]  It took him an hour just to outline the highlights of the last hundred days.
[00:39:06.913 --> 00:39:09.035]  I mean he signed more bills into law than
[00:39:09.514 --> 00:39:12.596]  More than any president in the first 100 days since Harry Truman.
[00:39:12.596 --> 00:39:19.801]  He's 13 different bills rolling back an avalanche of regulation and red tape on businesses across this country.
[00:39:19.801 --> 00:39:24.504]  500,000 jobs have been created since the first of the year.
[00:39:24.504 --> 00:39:26.205]  And you mentioned the Planned Parenthood issue.
[00:39:26.205 --> 00:39:27.446]  I know that's emerged.
[00:39:27.446 --> 00:39:30.428]  You know, the president recently signed a bill into law
[00:39:31.168 --> 00:39:36.370]  That ends the Obama-era regulation that blocked states from banning Planned Parenthood funding.
[00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:41.672]  Now states can ban Planned Parenthood funding like we tried to do in the state of Indiana.
[00:39:41.672 --> 00:39:50.476]  And of course, the health care bill that we hope comes up soon actually defunds Planned Parenthood altogether while we repeal and replace
[00:39:51.056 --> 00:39:51.676]  Yeah, I agree with Pence.
[00:39:51.676 --> 00:39:53.437]  It's just a fact that he's going to have to make deals with the Democrats.
[00:39:53.437 --> 00:39:56.718]  Ali Pak, who I really respect, has unendorsed him on some of the immigration issues.
[00:39:56.718 --> 00:39:58.139]  Trump was always going to reform immigration.
[00:40:19.571 --> 00:40:27.114]  But he's not going to let criminals and la reconquista, anti-American, islamicists, you name it, come in.
[00:40:27.114 --> 00:40:29.595]  But we killed half our kids with abortion in this country.
[00:40:29.595 --> 00:40:31.656]  We're going to have to replace the population.
[00:40:31.656 --> 00:40:35.757]  We need to do it with people that are integrated into the Americana system.
[00:40:35.757 --> 00:40:41.339]  And he's building the wall, and he is, you know, going after people that are hurting legally.
[00:40:41.339 --> 00:40:45.201]  But he's not what the media claimed he was, some racist that hates everybody.
[00:40:46.661 --> 00:40:54.068]  So, just like a lot of Christians, and I'm a Christian myself, got mad at him that he's not anti-gay once he got in.
[00:40:54.068 --> 00:40:56.591]  That was the media saying Trump was anti-gay.
[00:40:56.591 --> 00:40:59.774]  And so a lot of super right-wingers said, oh great, we love Trump.
[00:40:59.774 --> 00:41:03.337]  And I was like, hey guys, did you see the convention?
[00:41:03.337 --> 00:41:07.842]  With Trump saying let's be inclusive to everybody?
[00:41:07.842 --> 00:41:10.504]  Trump's a big tent guy.
[00:41:10.504 --> 00:41:10.865]  And so,
[00:41:12.366 --> 00:41:18.952]  That's the bottom line here, is that we have a president for the whole country, not just for certain groups or for small subsections.
[00:41:18.952 --> 00:41:20.333]  Now, him wanting to go after Assange?
[00:41:20.333 --> 00:41:22.816]  Absolutely terrible.
[00:41:22.816 --> 00:41:25.258]  He told Assange and others, if you got more WikiLeaks, release them.
[00:41:27.039 --> 00:41:28.540]  You want to indict Assange, President Trump?
[00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:29.841]  Indict yourself then.
[00:41:29.841 --> 00:41:31.342]  That's ridiculous.
[00:41:31.342 --> 00:41:33.003]  That's outrageous.
[00:41:33.003 --> 00:41:38.307]  And I know all the neocons and rhinos are pushing you for it, because then McCain will get off your back about Russia.
[00:41:38.307 --> 00:41:40.108]  He'll never get off your back!
[00:41:40.108 --> 00:41:42.530]  McCain funded the radical jihadis!
[00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:44.271]  McCain is the problem!
[00:41:44.271 --> 00:41:48.454]  You don't need to have him lead you around by the nose and have the tail wag the dog.
[00:41:48.454 --> 00:41:51.617]  Now we're going to Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:42:08.815]  Here in just a moment, but before I do that, we have kicked off and we've gone into the first 41 minutes here, ladies and gentlemen, of our global broadcast that we will do for 30 hours.
[00:42:08.815 --> 00:42:10.997]  What, until 5, 6 o'clock tomorrow?
[00:42:12.062 --> 00:42:15.345]  To raise awareness and to raise capital and to reach new people.
[00:42:15.345 --> 00:42:36.725]  The three goals are to rally our millions of radio listeners and millions of TV viewers and listeners online to really commit every day on email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, in person, at the grocery store, at church, at the synagogue, at the Rotary Club, at the golf course, at the shop with your buddies, or out hunting, whatever it is.
[00:42:37.898 --> 00:42:40.601]  To say this country's in trouble, but we're starting to turn the tide.
[00:42:40.601 --> 00:42:45.405]  Globalism is in decline, but they're trying to destroy Alex Jones.
[00:42:45.405 --> 00:42:49.529]  They're trying to destroy the few other outlets out there that'll tell the truth.
[00:42:49.529 --> 00:42:52.852]  We're under attack, so we need to spread the word about InfoWars.
[00:42:52.852 --> 00:42:56.696]  We need to spread the word about the articles and the videos and realize every day
[00:42:57.987 --> 00:43:08.092]  You see news we broke a week before, a month before, a year before, word-for-word on CNN, ABC News, CBS, Wall Street Journal.
[00:43:08.092 --> 00:43:09.993]  Word-for-word.
[00:43:09.993 --> 00:43:21.358]  Two months ago, two and a half months ago, he publishes five, six articles since then with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, with the documents, looting up to $300 billion.
[00:43:21.358 --> 00:43:22.859]  That's only limited documents he got.
[00:43:22.859 --> 00:43:23.239]  It's bigger.
[00:43:23.239 --> 00:43:25.120]  We're going to course you in a minute.
[00:43:26.078 --> 00:43:28.321]  And it all comes out in mainstream news.
[00:43:28.321 --> 00:43:32.425]  I'm going to play the clips exactly as we said with the Treasury Secretary saying.
[00:43:33.382 --> 00:43:37.483]  We're right, and Infowars getting credit because of Dr. Corsi, our D.C.
[00:43:37.483 --> 00:43:38.103]  Bureau Chief.
[00:43:38.103 --> 00:43:39.704]  They are so scared of him.
[00:43:39.704 --> 00:43:42.585]  And I've been told, shut up about this or we'll be destroyed.
[00:43:42.585 --> 00:43:48.247]  They've got six, seven, eight investigative journalists on me at all times making up crap right now.
[00:43:48.247 --> 00:43:50.167]  They're trying to destroy my family right now.
[00:43:50.167 --> 00:43:57.129]  They have the Federal Reserve Board of New York suing me right now with George Soros' law firm because they're scared of that guy in D.C.
[00:43:57.129 --> 00:43:59.170]  full-time hiring a team.
[00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:01.551]  One guy's already torn him up.
[00:44:01.551 --> 00:44:02.271]  Now, let's continue.
[00:44:03.524 --> 00:44:10.287]  They're scared of Infowars, they're scared of Paul Watson, they're scared of all my reporters, they're scared of the crew back there, they're scared of you!
[00:44:10.287 --> 00:44:15.530]  Because we are a focal point, like Ron Paul would always say, don't give him credit, he's just a focal point, he's coming up in about 20 minutes.
[00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:17.291]  We're gonna go to Corsi in a moment.
[00:44:17.291 --> 00:44:22.874]  But we're running a special today to raise capital, huge discounts as well.
[00:44:22.874 --> 00:44:26.836]  It's a product bomb, basically, of super high quality products, like a money bomb.

[00:44:45.216 --> 00:44:48.199]  They're coming after us because they can see our growth curve.
[00:44:48.199 --> 00:44:49.900]  If they don't take us out, we're going to bring them down.
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:50.741]  You're going to bring them down.

[00:46:25.379 --> 00:46:27.980]  I personally am not going to wear a guy on my shirt, but that's what women are mainly buying.
[00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:29.321]  And it says,
[00:46:30.441 --> 00:46:32.422]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:46:32.422 --> 00:46:33.263]  It's an awesome shirt.
[00:46:33.263 --> 00:46:34.824]  Infowars.com on the back.
[00:46:34.824 --> 00:46:36.245]  Really looks good on the ladies.

[00:46:41.428 --> 00:46:42.528]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:46:46.767 --> 00:46:47.568]  Word of mouth.
[00:46:47.568 --> 00:46:47.888]  All of it.
[00:46:47.888 --> 00:46:49.449]  Spread the word about this particular broadcast.
[00:46:49.449 --> 00:46:56.455]  They see the special 30-hour live transmission of a media outlet they're trying to shut down.
[00:46:56.455 --> 00:47:00.899]  Of a system of journalists they're trying to shut up because we're changing the world.
[00:47:00.899 --> 00:47:01.079]  Now.
[00:47:03.097 --> 00:47:05.099]  Let's go to Dr. Jerome Corsi, our D.C.
[00:47:05.099 --> 00:47:06.020]  Bureau head.
[00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:08.202]  We've got the offices, he's hiring the crew right now.
[00:47:08.202 --> 00:47:13.246]  He's doing so much more to help capitalize the operation, help us go to the next level.
[00:47:13.246 --> 00:47:21.674]  Dr. Corsi, Ph.D., Harvard in finance, worked with the State Department in clandestine operations, friends with Donald Trump, three times number one New York Times bestseller.
[00:47:21.674 --> 00:47:23.155]  That's all you need to know, a game changer.
[00:47:23.155 --> 00:47:28.980]  He reported in a slew of articles in February and in April
[00:47:29.915 --> 00:47:30.295]  It's
[00:47:47.382 --> 00:47:49.163]  And again, this is one reason they're coming after us.
[00:47:49.163 --> 00:47:53.586]  A month later, minutiae on Fannie and Freddie funds used to pay for Obamacare.
[00:47:53.586 --> 00:47:54.546]  It's true.
[00:47:54.546 --> 00:47:57.047]  Fox Business, Wall Street Journal.
[00:47:57.047 --> 00:48:05.032]  In his new article out yesterday, Treasury Secretary confirms Infowars.com reporting on Obama theft of Fannie and Freddie, Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[00:48:05.512 --> 00:48:07.112]  This is hard news.
[00:48:07.112 --> 00:48:16.195]  This is hard criminal looting that could bring down the entire Democratic power structure, and this is why the Republican establishment is out to get us as well, because they're part of it.
[00:48:16.195 --> 00:48:17.316]  So, Dr. Corsi, thank you.
[00:48:17.316 --> 00:48:22.457]  Let's recap what happened and how big this is, that after two-plus months, it's finally broken.
[00:48:22.457 --> 00:48:34.181]  Well, Alex, it's been a story we've been working on because it's, you know, we found out that Fannie and Freddie, the two mortgage giants, government-sponsored entities, in August 2012,
[00:48:36.309 --> 00:48:42.692]  The Obama administration began taking all the profits from Fannie and Freddie and confiscating them.
[00:48:42.692 --> 00:48:45.373]  It's called the Net Worth Sweep.
[00:48:45.373 --> 00:48:47.354]  It's a complicated operation.
[00:48:47.354 --> 00:49:05.201]  And I got in the middle of it and realized that what was happening was that Congress, the House specifically, had refused to fund the insurance premiums, the subsidies for low-income families and individuals under Obamacare.
[00:49:05.934 --> 00:49:08.475]  And so Obamacare in 2012 was going to tank.
[00:49:08.475 --> 00:49:13.238]  It was going to be completely bankrupt and wasn't going to work.
[00:49:13.238 --> 00:49:27.726]  And so what the Obama administration did was they took this money from Fannie and Freddie and diverted it, without announcing it illegally, into paying the Obamacare insurance subsidies.
[00:49:27.726 --> 00:49:28.567]  And that's amazing!
[00:49:28.567 --> 00:49:31.128]  Obamacare was what, a year old then and it was still going to fail?
[00:49:31.724 --> 00:49:40.871]  Yeah, so it was in the process of failing because the House refused to appropriate the money to pay these subsidies without being able to pay the insurance companies.
[00:49:40.871 --> 00:49:43.893]  So they looted the taxpayer-backed system for homeowning.
[00:49:43.893 --> 00:49:45.174]  That is incredible.
[00:49:45.174 --> 00:49:46.035]  That's what they did.
[00:49:46.035 --> 00:49:52.500]  And when I first published this and started breaking the news, we were denounced in the mainstream media.
[00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:53.981]  We were ridiculed.
[00:49:53.981 --> 00:49:56.143]  Even the Washington Examiner did a story.
[00:49:56.143 --> 00:50:00.306]  We had a story ridiculing us that was published even in Breitbart.
[00:50:01.198 --> 00:50:24.743]  And what I did was I went into the Treasury Department financial reports, specifically their balance sheet, and was able to prove, through an analysis of the financial records, that in fact the money had been diverted by the Treasury from Fannie and Freddie, the mortgage giants, to pay these insurance subsidiaries, to pay the insurance costs under Obamacare,
[00:50:25.689 --> 00:50:40.448]  And the House of Representatives filed a federal district court suit against the Department of Health and Human Services, and a judge in 2016, it was Judge Rosemary Cloyer,
[00:50:41.247 --> 00:50:46.551]  ...said that the House could no longer divert... I mean, the Obama administration could no longer divert money... All right, stay right there.
[00:50:46.551 --> 00:50:49.473]  So we've got judges, we've got Congress, no one will report it.
[00:50:49.473 --> 00:50:54.376]  Even conservative media is saying we're liars when you've got sources in Treasury, in the White House, and the documents.
[00:50:54.376 --> 00:50:56.797]  And now, two months later, we're totally vindicated.
[00:50:56.797 --> 00:50:59.779]  Where are the retractions by Breitbart and the Washington Examiner?
[00:50:59.779 --> 00:51:02.201]  Come on, guys, let's pull together in the same direction.
[00:51:02.201 --> 00:51:03.742]  I'm not in competition with you.

[00:54:22.294 --> 00:54:27.398]  Alright, here is the Treasury Secretary Mnuchin on Fox Business.
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:44.006]  A day ago, saying that Dr. Jerome Corsi is absolutely on target, that indeed Obama was looting the money from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac illegally, because Congress wouldn't fund it to fund Obamacare in the second year of the program, before it was even implemented fully.
[00:54:44.006 --> 00:54:44.407]  Here it is.
[00:54:44.407 --> 00:54:55.071]  There's a conversation going on on Twitter, and it has been for a long time, about how President Obama needed money for Obamacare and would take from all of the agencies, and he took from Fannie and Freddie.
[00:54:57.807 --> 00:54:58.529]  We're good to go.
[00:55:04.088 --> 00:55:09.931]  And also, I understand that Fannie and Freddie were not, they were exempt from the Freedom of Information Act.
[00:55:09.931 --> 00:55:17.796]  Just last week, I understand that the bill that Kevin Brady, I'm sorry, Kevin McCarthy was pushing through, is about taking them out of being exempt.
[00:55:17.796 --> 00:55:21.098]  The full clips in Dr. Corsi's article on Infowars.com.
[00:55:21.098 --> 00:55:22.739]  But notice, we're not getting credit.
[00:55:22.739 --> 00:55:24.700]  I mean, some of the financial papers were getting credit.
[00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:26.421]  They're saying, okay, they first appeared at Infowars.
[00:55:26.421 --> 00:55:28.122]  You're a respected journalist.
[00:55:28.122 --> 00:55:31.144]  You've had three number one New York Times bestselling political books.
[00:55:32.065 --> 00:55:35.127]  They admit you changed the course of at least one presidential election.
[00:55:35.127 --> 00:55:36.228]  You have all the sources.
[00:55:36.228 --> 00:55:37.669]  You got this.
[00:55:37.669 --> 00:55:41.191]  I mean, the White House has been trying to get others to report on this, obviously, for months.
[00:55:41.191 --> 00:55:43.432]  We had the courage to do it.
[00:55:43.432 --> 00:55:52.898]  And so I'm so ashamed of the other so-called conservative media who we defend, Breitbart and others, when they're under censorship, that they wrote articles saying we were full of crap.
[00:55:52.898 --> 00:55:53.739]  What is their problem?
[00:55:54.916 --> 00:56:10.483]  Well, the problem, Alex, I think is simple, that the mainstream media and even some of our competitors that we're working with want to support on the conservative side have a hard time acknowledging that InfoWars is publishing the truth.
[00:56:10.483 --> 00:56:16.465]  And here we have the Secretary of Treasury confirming the reporting that we did.
[00:56:16.465 --> 00:56:19.486]  And I can show you the articles where we were abused.
[00:56:19.486 --> 00:56:20.487]  Washington Examiner.
[00:56:20.487 --> 00:56:21.067]  I saw them.
[00:56:21.067 --> 00:56:22.067]  Even on Breitbart.
[00:56:24.332 --> 00:56:40.985]  And suddenly we get this confirmation from the Secretary of the Treasury that our reporting was correct from the beginning that the Obama administration was stealing from Fannie and Freddie illegally to pay subsidies in Obamacare that the Congress would not fund.
[00:56:40.985 --> 00:56:42.947]  But if you look down in the
[00:56:45.049 --> 00:56:50.012]  Deeper sources, the articles reporting on this, we're getting full credit for it.
[00:56:50.012 --> 00:57:00.418]  But at the top level, mainstream media, top level in the, even in conservative press, they're not giving kudos to InfoWars for having broken the story.
[00:57:00.418 --> 00:57:02.119]  And we broke the story for months, it was very...
[00:57:02.239 --> 00:57:06.260]  Very hard reporting and we were abused for reporting the story.
[00:57:06.260 --> 00:57:07.820]  Everybody said it wasn't true.
[00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:13.762]  Now it's confirmed and yet they're not acknowledging that InfoWars was the one who broke the story.
[00:57:13.762 --> 00:57:21.104]  Except on the internet and except on sources that really know what they're doing and are doing in-depth reporting on the question.
[00:57:21.104 --> 00:57:22.044]  There we're getting credit.
[00:57:23.706 --> 00:57:26.648]  And again, it's not about us tooting our horns saying we were right, we were right.
[00:57:26.648 --> 00:57:33.373]  I mean, a lot of financial publications did pick it up like ValueWalk and others did show that we reported it first.
[00:57:33.373 --> 00:57:41.418]  It's just what's frustrating is we do this, we get attacked, the system knows we're telling the truth, they try to destroy us, people need to know.
[00:57:42.239 --> 00:57:47.422]  The reason other people won't report this is they know that they come after you.
[00:57:47.422 --> 00:57:49.123]  So that's what we're telling listeners.
[00:57:49.123 --> 00:57:51.024]  You want somebody to fight hard.
[00:57:51.024 --> 00:57:52.865]  You want somebody to be a hard charger.
[00:57:52.865 --> 00:57:54.286]  You want somebody to not compromise.
[00:57:54.286 --> 00:57:56.347]  You want somebody to actually risk their lives.
[00:57:56.347 --> 00:57:58.468]  They're killing people in D.C.
[00:57:58.468 --> 00:57:59.889]  that are exposing stuff like this.
[00:57:59.889 --> 00:58:03.471]  They're exposing, you know, the Democrats trying to steal the election and things like that.
[00:58:03.471 --> 00:58:05.152]  Folks are getting shot in the back.
[00:58:05.152 --> 00:58:06.413]  They're getting their kids taken away.
[00:58:06.653 --> 00:58:09.197]  They're getting sued by the Federal Reserve of New York.
[00:58:09.197 --> 00:58:10.138]  This isn't a game.
[00:58:10.138 --> 00:58:12.841]  And so I'm just letting people know, this is a serious fight.
[00:58:12.841 --> 00:58:16.206]  And Dr. Corsi has been proven again, absolutely on target.
[00:58:16.206 --> 00:58:18.830]  I don't think I've ever seen Dr. Corsi be wrong yet.
[00:58:20.635 --> 00:58:29.359]  Well, Alex, the reason we get attacked so hard is because the mainstream media is afraid of us getting the truth out.
[00:58:29.359 --> 00:58:39.804]  They have to lie and say that, you know, Infowars is fake news because the truth is it's the mainstream media that wants to protect their fake narrative.
[00:58:39.804 --> 00:58:40.144]  That's right.
[00:58:40.144 --> 00:58:42.905]  They're the ones that are fake and won't run Trump ads exposing it.
[00:58:42.905 --> 00:58:46.967]  Back in 70 seconds to finish up, then Dr. Ron Paul's joining us with big news.
[00:58:46.967 --> 00:58:47.888]  Stay with us.
[00:58:47.888 --> 00:58:48.508]  Five more with Corsi.
[00:58:50.049 --> 00:58:52.263]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[00:58:56.266 --> 00:58:58.207]  Dr. Grimm, you developed Living Defense for us.
[00:58:58.207 --> 00:58:59.548]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:58:59.548 --> 00:59:00.769]  Why is this so good?
[00:59:00.769 --> 00:59:06.053]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:59:06.053 --> 00:59:19.603]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:59:19.603 --> 00:59:20.964]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:59:21.744 --> 00:59:23.365]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[00:59:23.365 --> 00:59:25.947]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:59:25.947 --> 00:59:27.248]  These are all parasites.
[00:59:27.248 --> 00:59:28.369]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:59:28.369 --> 00:59:29.690]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:34.213]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:59:34.213 --> 00:59:37.375]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:59:37.415 --> 00:59:40.516]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:59:40.516 --> 00:59:41.577]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:59:41.577 --> 00:59:43.518]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:43.518 --> 00:59:44.538]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:59:44.538 --> 00:59:47.219]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:59:47.219 --> 00:59:50.501]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:50.501 --> 00:59:52.742]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:59:52.742 --> 00:59:58.765]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:59:58.765 --> 01:00:01.406]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:10.942 --> 01:00:14.406]  Thunder struck with the truth like a lightning bolt from hell.
[01:00:14.406 --> 01:00:16.168]  Wednesday, May 3rd, 2017.
[01:00:16.168 --> 01:00:25.858]  And we've just kicked off a 30-hour transmission in defense of free speech and the West that are both under attack by globalist forces.
[01:00:26.579 --> 01:00:29.942]  The globalists have made a deadly miscalculation.
[01:00:29.942 --> 01:00:37.969]  They're attempting to openly shut down conservative, libertarian, and nationalist news on talk radio, in print, and on the internet.
[01:00:37.969 --> 01:00:49.838]  If we simply redouble our efforts, this will blow up in their face, and the population of the world will flock towards the forbidden information that holds the keys to humanity's empowerment and the stars.
[01:00:49.838 --> 01:00:51.580]  This is the defense of the West.
[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:54.281]  This is the defense of free speech.
[01:00:54.281 --> 01:00:57.481]  This is the defense of capitalism and free market.
[01:00:57.481 --> 01:01:06.284]  This is the defense of freedom, of prosperity, and the human spirit that refuses to submit.
[01:01:06.284 --> 01:01:08.444]  Dr. Corsi, Infowars.com, D.C.
[01:01:08.444 --> 01:01:08.964]  Bureau Chief.
[01:01:08.964 --> 01:01:09.625]  We've got the offices.
[01:01:09.625 --> 01:01:11.645]  He's getting the people hired thanks to your support.
[01:01:11.645 --> 01:01:14.666]  And big national news that nobody else would tell you.
[01:01:14.666 --> 01:01:16.906]  The White House was giving this to other people.
[01:01:16.906 --> 01:01:18.847]  We were some of the first, but nobody else would run with it.
[01:01:20.049 --> 01:01:30.012]  The documents, the lawsuits, the congressional investigations that were all secret, about $290-something billion, now more numbers are coming out, of looted taxpayer money.
[01:01:30.012 --> 01:01:37.394]  And two months later, after we break it, Steve Mnuchin, Treasury Secretary, comes out and says, we've got to put more money into Fannie and Freddie because they looted it.
[01:01:37.394 --> 01:01:38.395]  Obama really looted it.
[01:01:38.395 --> 01:01:39.515]  Here's that Fox Business clip.
[01:01:40.418 --> 01:01:50.182]  There's a conversation going on on Twitter, and it has been for a long time, about how President Obama needed money for Obamacare and would take from all of the agencies, and he took from Fannie and Freddie.
[01:01:50.182 --> 01:01:50.762]  Is that true?
[01:01:50.762 --> 01:01:51.842]  It is true.
[01:01:51.842 --> 01:01:59.145]  They used the profits of Fannie and Freddie to pay for other parts of the government, while they kept taxpayers at risk.
[01:01:59.145 --> 01:02:01.766]  And also, I understand that Fannie and Freddie...
[01:02:02.139 --> 01:02:03.980]  Again, Dr. Corsi, thanks for coming on.
[01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:05.360]  I want to get you on later today if you can do it.
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.721]  We've got a 30-hour broadcast going for a full 30 minutes an hour.
[01:02:07.721 --> 01:02:09.581]  Let us know what time you have this evening.
[01:02:09.581 --> 01:02:13.883]  I know you're really busy reporting and getting crew hired, but I want you to come on for a full 30 minutes an hour.
[01:02:13.883 --> 01:02:20.685]  We've only got a few minutes before Dr. Paul joins us, but the last numbers I had were almost 300 billion, but you were saying you were getting more documents.
[01:02:20.685 --> 01:02:22.386]  It was much larger a few weeks ago.
[01:02:22.386 --> 01:02:23.406]  Have you discovered anything new?
[01:02:24.286 --> 01:02:25.526]  Well, it's increasing.
[01:02:25.526 --> 01:02:35.570]  I mean, this is something that the Trump administration needs to stop, because in the first quarter, the Trump administration allowed the net worth sweep to go on.
[01:02:35.570 --> 01:02:40.592]  This is stealing money from the stockholders in spending.
[01:02:40.592 --> 01:02:42.853]  Wow, so Trump is continuing?
[01:02:42.853 --> 01:02:43.433]  It continued.
[01:02:43.433 --> 01:02:47.134]  First quarter, the Trump administration continued it.
[01:02:47.134 --> 01:02:51.516]  And right now, I'll be writing a story for tomorrow where the regulators of
[01:02:57.341 --> 01:03:07.525]  So this is a developing story, and again I think we'll be the first to publish that the regulators... Wilder's with the Trump administration, give us this intel, and then with the other hand it's still ongoing.
[01:03:07.525 --> 01:03:10.926]  I think that shows how divided the Trump administration is.
[01:03:10.926 --> 01:03:13.427]  The last minute we have, what do you make of Trump 104 days in?
[01:03:15.191 --> 01:03:30.304]  Well, I'm still very impressed with what he has accomplished and how hard it is fighting the Democrats, fighting the mainstream media, I think on a lot of fronts, jobs, closing the border, getting immigration under control, rolling back regulations.
[01:03:30.304 --> 01:03:34.988]  There's a lot of wins, but I've got confidence in President Trump.
[01:03:34.988 --> 01:03:40.232]  He's got a lot of obstacles, but I believe he's succeeding and he's going to succeed tremendously.
[01:03:40.232 --> 01:03:41.733]  I've been very close to President Trump.
[01:03:43.235 --> 01:03:51.943]  I've known him for 40 years, and I've never seen him fail, and he's on the same track I've seen before of success, and I'm 100% confident he's going to succeed.
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:08.785]  The White House was saying all we have to do is stop funding Obamacare.
[01:04:08.785 --> 01:04:11.648]  That was because of our reporting.
[01:04:11.648 --> 01:04:23.401]  We reported that all that President Trump would have to do is drop the appeal on this Burwell case and the fact that you can't divert money to pay for Fannie and Freddie when Congress wouldn't fund it.
[01:04:24.665 --> 01:04:28.287]  You know what?
[01:04:28.287 --> 01:04:32.449]  When can you come on later for 30 minutes today and really directly speak to Trump?
[01:04:32.449 --> 01:04:36.972]  Because I know they're listening to you because you're an expert from Harvard on this, on finance, how he can kill it.
[01:04:36.972 --> 01:04:39.913]  Because I see them mirroring what you're saying and then in consultation.
[01:04:39.913 --> 01:04:40.974]  When can you come back on today?
[01:04:41.722 --> 01:04:42.522]  Anytime you want me.
[01:04:42.522 --> 01:04:43.383]  I'm available all day.
[01:04:43.383 --> 01:04:48.364]  Okay, I'm gonna have Nico find a slot for you because I want you to really have the floor and break this down so we can announce it and tweet it.
[01:04:48.364 --> 01:04:50.485]  Great job on your investigative journalism.
[01:04:50.485 --> 01:04:52.385]  Every week you are just breaking huge news.
[01:04:52.385 --> 01:04:54.846]  I'm so proud to have you part of the operation, sir.
[01:04:54.846 --> 01:04:56.627]  I'm proud to be part of the operation.
[01:04:56.627 --> 01:04:57.247]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:04:57.247 --> 01:04:58.227]  Thank you.
[01:04:58.227 --> 01:05:01.568]  Alright, Congressman Ron Paul, former congressman, medical doctors joining us.
[01:05:01.568 --> 01:05:03.149]  Let's talk about the state of the world straight ahead.
[01:05:06.312 --> 01:05:08.414]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[01:05:08.414 --> 01:05:10.736]  Today I want to talk to you about guns.
[01:05:10.736 --> 01:05:11.777]  Why we have them.
[01:05:11.777 --> 01:05:15.160]  Why the Bill of Rights guarantees that we can have them.
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:20.665]  And why my right to have a gun is more important than your right to rail against it in the press.
[01:05:20.665 --> 01:05:27.591]  I believe every good journalist needs to know why the Second Amendment must be considered more essential than the First Amendment.
[01:05:27.691 --> 01:05:38.436]  This may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the right to keep and bear arms is not an outdated, dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the Redcoats.
[01:05:38.436 --> 01:05:41.898]  No, it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[01:05:43.979 --> 01:05:51.123]  The original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contain ten of what the constitutional framers termed unalienable rights.
[01:05:51.123 --> 01:05:53.785]  The Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on.
[01:05:53.785 --> 01:05:56.647]  It doesn't recognize color, or class, or wealth.
[01:05:56.647 --> 01:06:03.231]  It protects not just the rights of actors, or editors, or reporters, but extends even to those we love to hate.
[01:06:03.231 --> 01:06:06.073]  This is a small excerpt from Charlton Heston.
[01:06:06.073 --> 01:06:08.234]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue
[01:06:09.915 --> 01:06:14.316]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[01:06:14.316 --> 01:06:16.297]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[01:06:16.297 --> 01:06:21.318]  And since then, people are beating down our doors wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[01:06:21.318 --> 01:06:23.419]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:06:23.419 --> 01:06:24.699]  In fact, it's certified.
[01:06:24.699 --> 01:06:29.821]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:06:29.821 --> 01:06:33.182]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[01:06:33.322 --> 01:06:36.703]  That your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:06:36.703 --> 01:06:39.685]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:06:39.685 --> 01:06:43.386]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:06:43.386 --> 01:06:50.289]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:06:50.289 --> 01:06:57.792]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.
[01:06:57.792 --> 01:07:00.673]  Learn more about InfoWars Life Super Blue Toothpaste.
[01:07:00.933 --> 01:07:01.473]  We're good to go.
[01:07:20.623 --> 01:07:25.147]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium.
[01:07:25.147 --> 01:07:30.291]  But BioTrue Selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[01:07:30.291 --> 01:07:33.774]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[01:07:33.774 --> 01:07:37.798]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight.
[01:07:37.918 --> 01:07:46.002]  BioTrue Selenium is also the perfect supercharger to Survival Shield X2 Basin Iodine, as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[01:07:46.002 --> 01:07:50.905]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to order your bottle of BioTrue Selenium before we sell it again.
[01:07:50.905 --> 01:07:59.410]  That's InfoWarsLife.com to secure your selenium and other key products that don't only help yourself and your family, but also fund our operation against the globalists.
[01:07:59.410 --> 01:07:59.970]  A 360 win.
[01:07:59.970 --> 01:08:02.051]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[01:08:02.051 --> 01:08:03.552]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[01:08:03.552 --> 01:08:04.713]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:08:07.925 --> 01:08:14.253]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:08:27.868 --> 01:08:29.009]  It is a paradox.
[01:08:29.009 --> 01:08:31.790]  The best of times, the worst of times.
[01:08:31.790 --> 01:08:34.671]  Ron Paul ran for president back in the 90s and failed.
[01:08:34.671 --> 01:08:37.773]  Maybe one out of a hundred people knew the Federal Reserve was private.
[01:08:37.773 --> 01:08:39.273]  Today everybody knows it.
[01:08:39.273 --> 01:08:42.615]  Globalism is openly hated and is in decline around the world.
[01:08:43.746 --> 01:08:52.850]  The problem is we're still left with the same old corrupt political systems, and I had really hoped that Trump would be a paragon of true liberty.
[01:08:52.850 --> 01:09:00.493]  He's done a lot of good things like TPP and trying to get jobs back, but I gotta tell you, the healthcare bill he supported, bad.
[01:09:00.493 --> 01:09:02.374]  This new spending bill, bad.
[01:09:02.374 --> 01:09:08.516]  A lot of the things he's doing, going after Julian Assange, when he said, Julian, release it all!
[01:09:08.516 --> 01:09:12.498]  If we were gonna indict Julian Assange, who's a hero, or Snowden, who I think's a hero,
[01:09:14.093 --> 01:09:16.896]  Then we've got to have Trump call for his own indictment.
[01:09:16.896 --> 01:09:25.165]  And somebody who's really been warning of that is former congressman and of course medical doctor Ron Paul, who is undoubtedly the greatest living...
[01:09:26.622 --> 01:09:30.405]  Granddaddy of the liberty movement worldwide that we see just exploding.
[01:09:30.405 --> 01:09:32.787]  So again, a lot of good things happening, a lot of bad things happening.
[01:09:32.787 --> 01:09:43.296]  But the fact that even Trump would get elected as a patriot, as a nationalist, as kind of a libertarian, whether he ends up delivering on that or not, it shows how far we've come.
[01:09:43.296 --> 01:09:46.039]  But as Ron Paul always said, he had some chances to win the presidency.
[01:09:46.039 --> 01:09:47.020]  He was leading in many states.
[01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:50.171]  He said, when I get in, I'm not going to be a dictator.
[01:09:50.171 --> 01:09:50.992]  I can't fix it all.
[01:09:50.992 --> 01:09:52.012]  It's a cultural thing.
[01:09:52.012 --> 01:09:53.534]  But I think we've hit bottom.
[01:09:53.534 --> 01:09:54.414]  I think we're coming back.
[01:09:54.414 --> 01:09:55.035]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[01:09:55.035 --> 01:10:02.960]  We'll see what Ron Paul, with his great Liberty Report, reaching millions every day on radio and TV, joining us from Houston, has to say.
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:04.701]  But wow, so much to cover.
[01:10:04.701 --> 01:10:07.803]  What do you want to tackle first, sir?
[01:10:07.803 --> 01:10:08.964]  Well, nothing in particular.
[01:10:08.964 --> 01:10:11.926]  Whatever's in the events.
[01:10:11.926 --> 01:10:15.148]  Well, you may be having some technical difficulties.
[01:10:15.148 --> 01:10:16.969]  We'll work on that for just a second.
[01:10:16.969 --> 01:10:17.410]  An echo.
[01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:20.252]  I think he's getting a bad feedback.
[01:10:20.252 --> 01:10:22.834]  We'll work on that with the congressman here for just a second.
[01:10:22.834 --> 01:10:24.776]  You have the wonders of TV studios.
[01:10:24.776 --> 01:10:29.121]  This happens even on Fox News and CNN.
[01:10:29.121 --> 01:10:29.982]  Dr. Paul, can you hear me now?
[01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:31.960]  I can hear you.
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:32.640]  Let's try it.
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:36.822]  The trouble is my voice is way too loud.
[01:10:36.822 --> 01:10:40.403]  You know, I know what it's like when you're on Skype and your voice is coming back to you.
[01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:43.144]  It's very hard when it comes back delayed and really loud.
[01:10:43.144 --> 01:10:43.924]  It's crazy.
[01:10:43.924 --> 01:10:44.944]  Let's just begin with this.
[01:10:44.944 --> 01:10:45.905]  We'll give it a try.
[01:10:45.905 --> 01:10:46.845]  We'll try it.
[01:10:46.845 --> 01:10:47.525]  We'll give it a try.
[01:10:47.525 --> 01:10:48.846]  I know it's annoying.
[01:10:48.846 --> 01:10:52.087]  What do you make of Donald Trump so far?
[01:10:52.087 --> 01:10:56.068]  It does appear that he's really starting to go off track of what he said he was going to do.
[01:10:58.188 --> 01:11:01.972]  Well, I think people are starting to recognize that now.
[01:11:01.972 --> 01:11:11.641]  Our biggest problem in evaluating Trump is we don't know what he'll say tomorrow or the day before yesterday because it's back and forth.
[01:11:11.641 --> 01:11:16.225]  You know, we sort of liked him before he was elected because searching for things that I liked.
[01:11:16.225 --> 01:11:19.709]  I liked the fact that he thought we ought to be more reasonable dealing with Russia.
[01:11:20.249 --> 01:11:21.169]  Well, I agree.
[01:11:21.169 --> 01:11:21.470]  You wrote
[01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:54.285]  On your Liberty Report last week about, you know, here's President Trump saying, I love WikiLeaks, give him a medal, and then now he's saying arrest WikiLeaks.
[01:11:54.285 --> 01:11:58.668]  I mean, that is a real betrayal when WikiLeaks was exposing criminal activity.
[01:11:58.668 --> 01:12:03.090]  There's your headline, Candidate Trump, I love WikiLeaks, President Trump arrests Assange.
[01:12:03.090 --> 01:12:06.792]  Trump claims he's all about loyalty, and I've seen that in his past.
[01:12:06.792 --> 01:12:08.573]  Do you think the deep state has gotten to him?
[01:12:10.695 --> 01:12:12.436]  Oh, you know, it's hard for me to figure out.
[01:12:12.436 --> 01:12:16.978]  We can say what he has done, but we can't really read his mind on what's going on.
[01:12:16.978 --> 01:12:22.940]  I don't think he approaches things as so many of us try to do from a philosophic principle.
[01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:28.283]  I think his principle is pragmatism and do what you have to do or whatever crosses your mind at the moment.
[01:12:28.883 --> 01:12:37.326]  But it would be very, very disappointing if he was calling everybody's bluff, that he was saying everything intentionally.
[01:12:37.326 --> 01:12:40.787]  I'm going to get in office and I'm going to be the best neocon ever.
[01:12:40.787 --> 01:12:41.927]  You know, this sort of thing.
[01:12:41.927 --> 01:12:44.648]  That would be the most distasteful.
[01:12:44.648 --> 01:12:50.150]  The best excuse I can give him is that he doesn't come from a firm set of principles.
[01:12:50.150 --> 01:12:54.391]  And then he does yield to the political pressures because he does express things like,
[01:12:54.731 --> 01:12:56.472]  I didn't know this was so complicated.
[01:12:56.472 --> 01:12:57.913]  And that is true.
[01:12:57.913 --> 01:13:01.036]  He didn't know too much about how things worked in Washington.
[01:13:01.036 --> 01:13:04.518]  And you can't run Washington like you run a business.
[01:13:04.518 --> 01:13:10.783]  And that's always been a mistake, to think that you can, because it isn't a business.
[01:13:10.783 --> 01:13:13.105]  A business is run efficiently.
[01:13:13.105 --> 01:13:14.666]  Governments are inefficient.
[01:13:14.906 --> 01:13:20.887]  And that is the reason you want very little government, because they can't manage healthcare.
[01:13:20.887 --> 01:13:24.688]  It isn't the mismanagement, it's the fact that they're trying to manage healthcare.
[01:13:24.688 --> 01:13:32.670]  So that's the way it is with government, and now he's recognized this, and he can't bully his way through that and just say, I am the boss, you know, and this is what's gonna happen.
[01:13:32.670 --> 01:13:42.212]  There are too many other, everybody's in Washington thinks they're the boss, and they like to play this game, and they don't come from the position of what we really want is a lot less
[01:13:42.392 --> 01:13:42.933]  Government.
[01:13:42.933 --> 01:13:52.421]  So when he talks about draining the swamp, some of us have in our minds, oh, that means he's going to have a lot less, you know, government spending.
[01:13:52.421 --> 01:13:54.363]  But the spending, it's the same old stuff.
[01:13:54.363 --> 01:13:57.846]  The spending is going to go up and the militarism is going to go up.
[01:13:57.846 --> 01:14:03.991]  So and our First Amendments are going to be attacked and Planned Parenthood is going to get their money plus a little.
[01:14:03.991 --> 01:14:08.515]  So that has to be discouraging to a lot of people who had supported Trump.
[01:14:08.835 --> 01:14:11.316]  So the swamp really isn't getting drained.
[01:14:11.316 --> 01:14:12.537]  I mean, I guess it's getting drained a little bit.
[01:14:12.537 --> 01:14:15.899]  What's happening is Trump's getting drained.
[01:14:15.899 --> 01:14:16.979]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:14:16.979 --> 01:14:20.781]  I mean, there's a bit of realism there for him.
[01:14:20.781 --> 01:14:28.526]  But I think, you know, it was unrealistic to say that, you know, just look at me and I can do this, this, this.
[01:14:28.526 --> 01:14:33.068]  I mean, there was a lot of positive things, but people wanted the positive things.
[01:14:33.068 --> 01:14:36.370]  You know, one of the characteristics of Ronald Reagan was that people saw him
[01:14:36.770 --> 01:14:39.794]  As being very positive and not talking about the problems.
[01:14:39.794 --> 01:14:48.144]  Sometimes what I'm amazed at is over the years I've talked about all the problems and I feel like, oh, I'm too negative.
[01:14:48.144 --> 01:14:55.854]  But the one thing is, is so many young people, if they listen to our message and you come up with just a hint.
[01:14:56.494 --> 01:14:58.076]  This doesn't have to be this way.
[01:14:58.076 --> 01:14:59.478]  There are answers.
[01:14:59.478 --> 01:15:06.828]  Actually, describing something as negative is a blessing and it's a positive because you're telling them the truth and they recognize it.
[01:15:06.828 --> 01:15:11.535]  But to say that everything is rosy without really describing it and what you're going to do, it's all.
[01:15:11.875 --> 01:15:27.957]  I feel very comfortable in describing the problems of the Federal Reserve and the budget spending and the foreign policy and the attack on civil liberties, but then to come up with the answer, which is a constitutional answer, as well as an answer that is embedded with the principles of liberty.
[01:15:28.597 --> 01:15:32.140]  And that if you're looking for peace and prosperity, you go in that direction.
[01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:34.242]  So it's a very positive message.
[01:15:34.242 --> 01:15:38.585]  And I think you've recognized this over the year that people like to hear that.
[01:15:38.585 --> 01:15:45.691]  And you can still talk about the negatives, but it comes across as telling the truth rather than just saying it.
[01:15:45.751 --> 01:15:45.971]  Absolutely.
[01:16:02.102 --> 01:16:07.904]  Dr. Ron Paul, you mentioned attacks on free speech, and I want to get into that in a moment, because you've had that happen, I've had that happen.
[01:16:07.904 --> 01:16:11.165]  But I happen to know the President does respect you, he says he respects you.
[01:16:11.165 --> 01:16:18.387]  He's getting along with Rand now, and is hopefully listening to him about getting a better bill to replace Obamacare, not just have Obamacare light.
[01:16:18.387 --> 01:16:23.108]  So it's good to see Rand, who I think is the best Senator in Congress.
[01:16:23.108 --> 01:16:25.849]  Matt Drudge agrees with that, and obviously met with him a month ago or so.
[01:16:26.269 --> 01:16:31.272]  He said he is the best senator, obviously from your tutelage and his own research and life.
[01:16:31.272 --> 01:16:33.034]  He does have the grasp on that.
[01:16:33.034 --> 01:16:40.699]  I would hope that the president would get closer to Rand and obviously get more of his advice, because your son is more of a purist Americana.
[01:16:40.699 --> 01:16:47.783]  But separately from that, just spend a few minutes on advice to the president, because I know he does actually tune into the show.
[01:16:47.783 --> 01:16:50.425]  He does actually crave what the public thinks.
[01:16:50.425 --> 01:16:51.486]  He respects you.
[01:16:51.486 --> 01:16:54.828]  Just spend a few minutes on what you would say to the president.
[01:16:56.345 --> 01:17:03.352]  Well, of course, you know, if it's not, if you're not invited, it doesn't do much good, but I can try to accommodate what you're saying.
[01:17:03.352 --> 01:17:09.098]  But it's very rare that people in Washington really want your advice.
[01:17:09.098 --> 01:17:13.323]  I was always told is study hard, understand it, present your case.
[01:17:14.163 --> 01:17:19.487]  And somebody will come to you, and there will be a job for you, and you present your case.
[01:17:19.487 --> 01:17:28.372]  And on a few occasions in Washington, I had other members come up that were very serious, you know, and they did a bit of a conversion, you know, say on foreign policy or something.
[01:17:28.372 --> 01:17:31.194]  So that is always possible.
[01:17:31.194 --> 01:17:36.637]  But to just decide you're going to advise somebody, it's not real practical.
[01:17:36.637 --> 01:17:38.018]  They're not going to pay a lot of attention.
[01:17:38.018 --> 01:17:40.219]  But indeed... Sure, what should Trump do then?
[01:17:40.219 --> 01:17:41.200]  I mean, he does listen to you.
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:42.400]  He says he respects you.
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:43.101]  He's tweeted that.
[01:17:43.821 --> 01:17:44.622]  He will listen to you.
[01:17:44.622 --> 01:17:45.482]  I mean, what do you think?
[01:17:45.482 --> 01:17:46.463]  Trump's done good.
[01:17:46.463 --> 01:17:48.504]  What's he done bad?
[01:17:48.504 --> 01:17:53.467]  Well, I think he's backed down on, you know, the spending and all.
[01:17:53.467 --> 01:17:56.969]  And if my advice would be, let the Congress go ahead and pass these bills.
[01:17:56.969 --> 01:18:01.992]  Tell them what you want, let them pass it, and then veto the bill.
[01:18:01.992 --> 01:18:05.334]  But try not to be flip-flopping all over the place.
[01:18:05.334 --> 01:18:10.677]  You know, some of us really want him to do what he claimed he was going to do.
[01:18:10.677 --> 01:18:13.079]  But you know, when I look at it, then all of a sudden I see, well,
[01:18:13.439 --> 01:18:22.145]  All the presidents said in recent years the one that is a little less militant is usually the one that wins the election and Trump was less militant.
[01:18:22.145 --> 01:18:30.230]  So I would say work toward consistency and get rid of the flip-flopping and if you believe in less government stick to that.
[01:18:30.230 --> 01:18:40.177]  But you can't pretend to hold on to people who want less government and you're increasing the budget and you spend more money and say you want to spend it on such and such.
[01:18:40.177 --> 01:18:41.358]  Oh well we'll give you that.
[01:18:41.358 --> 01:18:42.478]  Well let me ask you this then.
[01:18:43.679 --> 01:18:44.900]  Where do you think it's going?
[01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:53.065]  Because he did some good things, like TPP and a lot of other things, but then suddenly it seemed by day 70 really went off trajectory.
[01:18:53.065 --> 01:18:54.846]  I think that's part of that coup against Bannon.
[01:18:54.846 --> 01:18:58.148]  As soon as Bannon was demoted, we saw the trajectory change.
[01:18:58.148 --> 01:19:00.630]  Is there any way in your mind to get him back on trajectory?
[01:19:01.852 --> 01:19:12.536]  Yeah, well I think it's very secondary to what's going on because, you know, they say tomorrow there's a beginning of an economic bust like it happened in 2008.
[01:19:12.536 --> 01:19:18.238]  Trump's not responsible for that, but he'll get blamed for it, that sort of thing.
[01:19:18.238 --> 01:19:19.379]  So I think things are...
[01:19:20.259 --> 01:19:23.501]  Out of control of an individual like this.
[01:19:23.501 --> 01:19:26.282]  So it's not what should Trump do.
[01:19:26.282 --> 01:19:28.002]  The country is bankrupt.
[01:19:28.002 --> 01:19:39.607]  And doing what they're doing, the establishment, Republicans and Democrats, I mean, they have always gotten together with these omnibus bills and these continuing resolutions.
[01:19:39.607 --> 01:19:41.248]  And they always spend more money.
[01:19:41.248 --> 01:19:43.069]  They endorse intervention overseas.
[01:19:43.069 --> 01:19:45.790]  They endorse the financial system, the Federal Reserve.
[01:19:45.790 --> 01:19:47.610]  They're not opposed to- More of the same.
[01:19:49.211 --> 01:19:53.994]  But it's not because all of a sudden Trump isn't sticking to his word.
[01:19:53.994 --> 01:19:57.977]  It's the fact that the country is addicted to spending.
[01:19:57.977 --> 01:20:07.003]  I was about to say, we saw federal agencies just ignore him when he was trying to do the right thing and just basically the deep state refusing, something you've talked a lot about.
[01:20:07.003 --> 01:20:07.943]  So let's speak to that.
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:14.802]  But the people, the people are responsible too.
[01:20:14.802 --> 01:20:16.943]  Congress is a mess.
[01:20:16.943 --> 01:20:32.531]  But the people, you know, why they had to back off, why the Republican leadership backed off on Obamacare is the yelling and screaming and the noise that was made by people saying, I have a right to medical care, I want free medical care, and you can't take it away from us.
[01:20:32.531 --> 01:20:35.812]  So there's still a lot of people out there are still believing in fascism.
[01:20:35.812 --> 01:20:39.094]  So it doesn't matter if it bankrupts our health care, they want something quote free today.
[01:20:40.296 --> 01:20:45.622]  Right, and that's the bigger problem compared to what's Trump going to do tomorrow versus yesterday.
[01:20:45.622 --> 01:20:46.903]  Sure, where's the problem, Arteko?
[01:20:50.849 --> 01:20:57.152]  Unless you accept a different position on the role of government, none of this is going to be solved.
[01:20:57.152 --> 01:21:05.696]  And I don't think, I think that no matter what we put up in Washington, we're going into a very, very dire economic problem.
[01:21:05.696 --> 01:21:08.978]  And I think our empire is going to end.
[01:21:08.978 --> 01:21:12.780]  And unfortunately, the whistleblowers are going to be attacked more than ever.
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:22.405]  But in the end, what we need is a whole generation of people advocating and understanding what liberty is all about.
[01:21:22.405 --> 01:21:25.587]  That's what happened during our original revolution.
[01:21:25.587 --> 01:21:31.471]  And now, we don't need the old revolution, we need the expansion of those views that were held by the founders.
[01:21:31.471 --> 01:21:38.615]  And it has to be endorsed, not just by a few of us, we need more people to the point where every TV now supports the state.
[01:21:41.977 --> 01:21:45.279]  The Republican TV is not much better than the Democrat TV.
[01:21:45.279 --> 01:21:46.700]  So we need 1776 2.0.
[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:49.962]  So in the few minutes we have left, let me bring this up to you.
[01:21:49.962 --> 01:21:54.505]  I don't know if you saw it, but it was in national news.
[01:21:54.505 --> 01:22:00.248]  I got the secret documents through Mike Cernovich that Google was spending millions of dollars to delist InfoWars.
[01:22:00.248 --> 01:22:05.612]  And they listed, because I played clips of Ron Paul saying this is probably a false flag in Syria.
[01:22:06.152 --> 01:22:17.842]  And because I played Putin, and because I played some army colonels, and they said, this is an example of fake news, so delist Alex Jones, and have an army of trolls go out and start voting him down.
[01:22:17.842 --> 01:22:20.865]  Now, because we published the document, two days later they said, okay,
[01:22:21.505 --> 01:22:22.826]  Rogue contractors did that.
[01:22:22.826 --> 01:22:24.207]  We're going to stop now.
[01:22:24.207 --> 01:22:25.808]  But it wasn't because you were fake news.
[01:22:25.808 --> 01:22:31.573]  They admitted in 2013-2016 that the rebels got caught launching fake attacks.
[01:22:31.573 --> 01:22:33.254]  We had this rush to judgment.
[01:22:33.254 --> 01:22:35.696]  The British ambassador says it's clearly the rebels.
[01:22:35.696 --> 01:22:39.919]  It sets a precedent where the rebels can stage events and then we rush to judgment.
[01:22:39.919 --> 01:22:46.544]  Your son helped lead the move in the Senate to not have a rush to judgment in 2013 and be Al Qaeda slash ISIS's air force.
[01:22:46.544 --> 01:22:48.025]  So we've now gotten to the point where
[01:22:48.946 --> 01:22:52.428]  I have a member of the Federal Reserve Board of New York suing me.
[01:22:52.428 --> 01:22:53.529]  I've been told shut up.
[01:22:53.529 --> 01:22:55.450]  I have George Soros' firm suing me.
[01:22:55.450 --> 01:23:00.694]  I have Dr. Corsi breaking that Obama looted $300 billion out of Fannie Mae Freddie Mac for Obamacare.
[01:23:00.694 --> 01:23:04.076]  I've been told shut up about that or we'll destroy you.
[01:23:04.076 --> 01:23:07.378]  So that's the type of stuff, the type of messages that I've got now.
[01:23:07.378 --> 01:23:11.841]  I know as a congressman you probably got threats too, but I've never had it at this level.
[01:23:11.841 --> 01:23:16.605]  What do you make of that and why do you think they were so scared of me?
[01:23:16.605 --> 01:23:18.686]  They listed playing Ron Paul clip.
[01:23:20.427 --> 01:23:27.794]  Well, they're protecting the state, and they're protecting the deep state as well.
[01:23:27.794 --> 01:23:38.023]  Two individuals that went to prison that were in Congress, for one major reason, they were both very, very strong anti-IRS and wrote books against them.
[01:23:38.023 --> 01:23:40.325]  I think that was their major problem.
[01:23:40.325 --> 01:23:46.330]  And the same way, what we have developed here is sort of a fascist system.
[01:23:46.690 --> 01:23:53.572]  You know, the government doesn't own Google and all this social media, but they have control over it.
[01:23:53.572 --> 01:23:57.634]  And they've sold out to the government because they're collecting all the information.
[01:23:57.634 --> 01:24:05.076]  And, oh, the government doesn't collect this, but if we need it, Google will give it to us, and all these organizations, Facebook, they'll give it to them because
[01:24:05.396 --> 01:24:07.137]  They're exempt from any liability.
[01:24:07.137 --> 01:24:09.257]  The Congress gave them the exemption.
[01:24:09.257 --> 01:24:15.460]  That you can't go and if somebody in social media has turned over your information, they're not liable.
[01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:17.380]  But the Congress gave them that.
[01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:29.885]  So it's a mixture of big business and big government and it's a terrible thing and there's big money involved that has nothing to do with helping the poor people or helping the middle class get medical care.
[01:24:30.485 --> 01:24:39.089]  Uh, it's, uh, it's power, and it's control, and it's protection of the state, and that's why whistleblowers are the greatest enemies of this, you know.
[01:24:39.089 --> 01:24:41.950]  Truth becomes treason when you have an empire.
[01:24:41.950 --> 01:24:49.254]  We have an empire, so anybody who tells the truth, and it would be in relative levels, they're going to go after those individuals.
[01:24:49.654 --> 01:24:51.775]  So that's what we're up against.
[01:24:51.775 --> 01:25:00.177]  When I left the Congress this past time, I listed some of the concerns and my number one concern was the destruction of the First Amendment to speak out.
[01:25:00.177 --> 01:25:14.862]  Believing sincerely, if you and I still have the privilege, the right to speak out without the government coming down on us, that we could change the system because ideas have consequences and they're more powerful than armies.
[01:25:15.342 --> 01:25:20.285]  But our enemies, the opposition, understands this.
[01:25:20.285 --> 01:25:25.108]  Because if we can silence people, we can silence those ideas.
[01:25:25.108 --> 01:25:26.629]  I don't think they can.
[01:25:26.629 --> 01:25:29.971]  Ideas can't be stopped by armies, and we know that.
[01:25:29.971 --> 01:25:37.876]  So I think the ideology is where the battle has to be, not with what Trump is going to do tomorrow.
[01:25:37.876 --> 01:25:38.376]  I agree.
[01:25:38.376 --> 01:25:39.737]  Let me just say this in closing.
[01:25:40.077 --> 01:25:42.638]  I am very honored to be demonized like you have been over the years.
[01:25:42.638 --> 01:25:44.299]  I'm very honored to join that exclusive club.
[01:25:44.299 --> 01:25:50.742]  It's just crazy the way they lie, the way they twist, the way they call us racist, when we're the total opposite of that, promoting Martin Luther King.
[01:25:50.742 --> 01:25:58.105]  And I just see, as you say, all the economists saying, if we don't turn things around soon, we're going to implode into a worldwide depression.
[01:25:58.105 --> 01:26:00.747]  And I just feel sorry for the people in the establishment.
[01:26:00.747 --> 01:26:05.589]  Most media admits that they're not really against us, but they will lose their job if they don't attack us.
[01:26:06.169 --> 01:26:10.595]  And so, you know, there's got to be some way that we all just speak out and kind of turn the tide here.
[01:26:10.595 --> 01:26:14.841]  But in closing, do you think there's any way to turn around economic collapse now?
[01:26:14.841 --> 01:26:17.946]  And where do you see all this militarism going?
[01:26:17.946 --> 01:26:19.248]  Where do you see this planet going?
[01:26:20.578 --> 01:26:22.900]  Well, in theory you can.
[01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:29.327]  I mean, if you had the right people in the right places and in the Congress, you could devise a transition, actually.
[01:26:29.327 --> 01:26:36.534]  And that's what I talked about in the presidential races, where you could do it as a transition, but you would have to systematically cut back.
[01:26:36.534 --> 01:26:39.757]  The odds of that happening are essentially nil.
[01:26:39.757 --> 01:26:42.200]  So what we have to do is continue
[01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:43.540]  The old empire has fell.
[01:27:00.405 --> 01:27:01.525]  We built more weapons.
[01:27:01.525 --> 01:27:03.306]  It was a flawed system.
[01:27:03.306 --> 01:27:04.286]  Our system is flawed.
[01:27:04.286 --> 01:27:05.626]  It will collapse.
[01:27:05.626 --> 01:27:14.648]  We probably won't have enough good sense to just cut back because the people who are dependent on the government, and like I said, the rich and the poor, become dependent.
[01:27:14.648 --> 01:27:26.930]  So when the collapse comes, we have to have enough people understanding what true liberty is all about, and we have to advance the cause of liberty more so than even the advancement we had at the time of our revolution.
[01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:28.350]  So you think it's fair to say Trump
[01:27:28.450 --> 01:27:30.531]  Is not averting the collapse and it's closer than ever?
[01:27:30.531 --> 01:27:34.832]  Well, I think it's not relevant.
[01:27:34.832 --> 01:27:47.097]  I don't think anybody in Washington at the moment is very relevant because I think what people are thinking and learning in their schools and where they're getting their information, that is relevant.
[01:27:48.437 --> 01:27:54.324]  And trying to get some young people to be involved to help, you know, with the replacement.
[01:27:54.324 --> 01:27:55.605]  Sure, then last question.
[01:27:55.605 --> 01:28:03.694]  Aren't you concerned, historically as a historian, not just a doctor and a former congressman, but I know you're, you know, with the Von Mises Institute as an economist and historian.
[01:28:04.255 --> 01:28:08.299]  Dope governments and empires almost always launch a war before they let themselves fall.
[01:28:08.299 --> 01:28:09.179]  China's teetering.
[01:28:09.179 --> 01:28:11.081]  The EU's teetering even worse than us.
[01:28:11.081 --> 01:28:12.402]  We're teetering.
[01:28:12.402 --> 01:28:14.484]  You know, we're the best house in a bad neighborhood.
[01:28:14.484 --> 01:28:20.129]  This just, if you look at this historically and project forward, this is like a dystopic novel what we're going into.
[01:28:20.822 --> 01:28:24.946]  Yeah, well, I don't know whether it's that deliberate, but the war is related.
[01:28:24.946 --> 01:28:33.213]  I think the wars bring you to the destruction, and we've been involved for all these years, and we're involved steadily right now, and that's totally out of control.
[01:28:33.213 --> 01:28:34.233]  So that will bring it.
[01:28:34.233 --> 01:28:35.915]  Yeah, they might.
[01:28:36.415 --> 01:28:42.177]  Try to make a bigger war, but by the time it's recognized how bad off we are, they won't be able to.
[01:28:42.177 --> 01:28:52.241]  So war is related, but the wars have already been there, and that's, you know, hurrying up the destruction of the economy, and it will bring us down economically.
[01:28:52.241 --> 01:28:52.621]  Sure.
[01:28:52.621 --> 01:28:55.682]  Well, your son's teaching a course on dystopia, and the left's mad at him.
[01:28:55.682 --> 01:29:01.645]  It seems like they think, on May Day, that communism's great, but look at Venezuela, look at everywhere else.
[01:29:01.645 --> 01:29:04.005]  Is the best website RonPaulLibertyReport.com?
[01:29:04.005 --> 01:29:05.126]  Because you've got a lot of websites.
[01:29:06.184 --> 01:29:15.972]  Yeah, I know, the littlebittyreport.com is the one that we're working the hardest on, and that's where our program comes out every day at 11 o'clock Central Time.
[01:29:15.972 --> 01:29:23.219]  It's live, but it's been very successful, it's growing, and the more people that can join us there, the happier we'll be.
[01:29:23.219 --> 01:29:34.008]  Alright, well thank you for the time, and I gotta say it again, you used to work yourself to death and you looked great, but for your age, you look like 10 years younger now, so let me guess, you like being a journalist now?
[01:29:35.706 --> 01:29:47.953]  Well, I don't think of myself as anything in particularly other than trying to fully understand what liberty means, who benefits, and a better way to present it to the people who are interested in learning.
[01:29:47.953 --> 01:29:50.574]  A true watchman on the wall, a 21st century Paul Revere.
[01:29:50.574 --> 01:29:51.595]  Thank you, Dr. Paul.
[01:29:51.595 --> 01:29:53.036]  Have a great week coming up, sir.
[01:29:53.036 --> 01:29:55.337]  Thank you.
[01:29:55.337 --> 01:29:56.718]  We're on the march.
[01:29:56.718 --> 01:29:59.259]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:59.259 --> 01:30:01.941]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:06.733 --> 01:30:19.815]  Police departments across the country are now using an invasive surveillance tool called stingrays, which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and text messages without warrants.
[01:30:21.107 --> 01:30:33.090]  The technology comes courtesy of the FBI, who have forced our nation's police departments into signing non-disclosure agreements, forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology.
[01:30:33.090 --> 01:30:49.374]  Needless to say, this is a direct violation of our Fourth Amendment, and they have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying, where we now know that police are collecting information on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes.
[01:30:49.834 --> 01:30:54.841]  Once again, more evidence that the police state isn't coming, it's already here.
[01:30:54.841 --> 01:30:59.066]  This is Darren McBreen and I invite you to join the resistance.
[01:30:59.066 --> 01:31:00.448]  InfoWars.com.
[01:31:05.407 --> 01:31:06.227]  Hey, everyone!
[01:31:06.227 --> 01:31:08.508]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[01:31:08.508 --> 01:31:12.348]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:31:12.348 --> 01:31:14.429]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:31:14.429 --> 01:31:24.711]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:31:24.711 --> 01:31:30.692]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:31:31.172 --> 01:31:46.101]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[01:31:46.121 --> 01:31:46.702]  I think so.
[01:32:05.311 --> 01:32:13.295]  InfoWars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:32:13.295 --> 01:32:19.938]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[01:32:19.938 --> 01:32:28.222]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[01:32:28.522 --> 01:32:37.535]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[01:32:37.535 --> 01:32:43.284]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[01:32:43.604 --> 01:32:44.385]  It works.
[01:32:44.385 --> 01:32:52.832]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[01:32:52.832 --> 01:33:02.600]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the globalists all at the same time.
[01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:03.060]  A total 360 win.
[01:33:20.209 --> 01:33:24.337]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:50.365 --> 01:33:55.871]  Hey!
[01:33:55.871 --> 01:34:00.756]  Hollywood Babylon, baby.
[01:34:00.756 --> 01:34:04.159]  We've got Katherine Austen-Fitts, who worked in the Clinton administration.
[01:34:04.159 --> 01:34:10.165]  She did all the corruption, the banking, HUD, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, so much more.
[01:34:10.165 --> 01:34:10.966]  Always great to have her on.
[01:34:10.966 --> 01:34:11.666]  Mike Cernovich.
[01:34:13.032 --> 01:34:16.875]  We've got so many people coming up in this 30-hour global transmission.
[01:34:16.875 --> 01:34:20.997]  A bunch of clips, a bunch of military news, a bunch of really important stuff I have to get to.
[01:34:20.997 --> 01:34:24.840]  Civil defense expert, white genocide imminent in South Africa.
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:34.607]  And that's happened in the Congo, it's happened in Rhodesia, it's happened basically everywhere in Africa to the point of pure starvation when the white farmers and the infrastructure get driven out.
[01:34:35.307 --> 01:34:37.370]  It's happened with Robert Mugabe.
[01:34:37.370 --> 01:34:37.850]  It's a fact.
[01:34:37.850 --> 01:34:39.372]  That story's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:34:39.372 --> 01:34:40.654]  Very, very sad.
[01:34:40.654 --> 01:34:41.855]  But that's what ends up happening.
[01:34:41.855 --> 01:34:43.417]  And, you know, that happens in any tribal culture.
[01:34:43.417 --> 01:34:46.722]  The Africans are always genociding each other, depending on tribal lines.
[01:34:47.534 --> 01:34:51.337]  You know, depending on what animus group you're in, or what Muslim group you're in, or what Christian group you're in.
[01:34:51.337 --> 01:34:55.101]  Tribes, even if they're the same tribe, kill each other routinely.
[01:34:55.101 --> 01:34:56.742]  So, just imagine.
[01:34:56.742 --> 01:35:01.387]  That's a conquest-based economy, not a resource-based economy, more and more.
[01:35:01.387 --> 01:35:05.951]  Now that Libya has been destroyed, South Africa has gone from one tyranny to another.
[01:35:05.951 --> 01:35:08.133]  It's all just sinking back into the jungle.
[01:35:08.133 --> 01:35:09.754]  Very, very sad to see that unfolding.
[01:35:10.775 --> 01:35:20.023]  Macron camp, that's the globalist running against Marie Le Pen, fear high French abstention, people not voting, rate could damage their chances.
[01:35:20.023 --> 01:35:23.966]  So they're getting everybody ready for a loss on that front, even though they're trying to cheat it.
[01:35:23.966 --> 01:35:31.372]  Paradise lost, idyllic French villages turned to far right, which just means they think a million or two new Islamists every few years is enough.
[01:35:31.372 --> 01:35:35.335]  They don't like having their neighborhoods burned down, so they're far right, because they have a survival mechanism.
[01:35:37.259 --> 01:35:43.022]  And Putin yesterday discussed Syrian cooperation in phone call and a ceasefire they hope to develop.
[01:35:43.022 --> 01:35:43.242]  U.S.
[01:35:43.242 --> 01:35:47.264]  and Russian leader reportedly agreed to meet during G20 and not have their own meeting.
[01:35:47.264 --> 01:35:53.546]  So Trump's been effectively intimidated by the media and John McCain not to meet with his Russian counterpart.
[01:35:53.546 --> 01:35:55.547]  Not a good thing, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:55.547 --> 01:35:57.028]  Not a good thing.
[01:35:57.028 --> 01:35:57.928]  Trump fires back.
[01:35:57.928 --> 01:35:58.128]  U.S.
[01:35:58.128 --> 01:36:03.211]  launches nuke missiles just days after Kim's nightmare firing of another missile.
[01:36:04.292 --> 01:36:04.573]  U.S.
[01:36:04.573 --> 01:36:09.240]  is testing ICBMs and now we have U.S.
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:11.604]  commandos at the counter North Korean nuclear sites.
[01:36:12.952 --> 01:36:14.613]  Set to go in and take those out on the ground.
[01:36:14.613 --> 01:36:16.054]  Talk about a dangerous mission.
[01:36:16.054 --> 01:36:17.295]  In order to do so, the U.S.
[01:36:17.295 --> 01:36:23.060]  is flying B-2 bombers over North Korea in nuke attack runs, test runs.
[01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:25.962]  China urges citizens in North Korea to return home.
[01:36:25.962 --> 01:36:27.103]  So has Japan.
[01:36:27.103 --> 01:36:29.905]  So things are escalating very, very quickly.
[01:36:29.905 --> 01:36:32.747]  China clamps on online news with new security rules.
[01:36:32.747 --> 01:36:36.590]  Fox News reports we're getting more and more clampdowns here as well.
[01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:37.831]  So that's just some of what's happening.
[01:36:37.831 --> 01:36:40.873]  We told you about this months ago, but it's now in the New York Post.
[01:36:40.873 --> 01:36:42.235]  So it's big breaking news here.
[01:36:43.214 --> 01:36:44.334]  Again, Infowars.
[01:36:44.334 --> 01:36:47.795]  Get your news years, months, or days before anybody else.
[01:36:47.795 --> 01:36:50.676]  People keep asking, what's our slogan?
[01:36:50.676 --> 01:36:55.677]  Frontlines of truth journalism, you know, battling the establishment, trying to overthrow the corrupt establishment.
[01:36:55.677 --> 01:36:58.218]  You know, Breitbart has all our terms that we've used.
[01:36:58.218 --> 01:36:59.098]  We are the resistance.
[01:36:59.098 --> 01:37:00.458]  Democrats now use that.
[01:37:00.458 --> 01:37:03.439]  Everything we do is copied precisely, but then twisted.
[01:37:03.439 --> 01:37:06.520]  Let me give you the new slogan for Twitter, for Facebook.
[01:37:07.981 --> 01:37:16.803]  For all our sites, I'm going to have them redesigned, all our pages, our new tagline isn't just a war on for your mind, that'll always be our original, because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:37:16.803 --> 01:37:18.283]  Info Wars.
[01:37:18.283 --> 01:37:20.624]  Notice that's the term of the last few years is Info War.
[01:37:20.624 --> 01:37:22.044]  I'm not bragging, it's just that's why they hate us.
[01:37:22.044 --> 01:37:32.187]  We're trailblazing because we're digging up the old technologies of humanity, the old social systems, the old understandings that they hope you forget, because those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[01:37:32.187 --> 01:37:32.827]  You notice that
[01:37:35.185 --> 01:37:37.970]  The enemy's coming after us because they know we're trailblazers.
[01:37:37.970 --> 01:37:45.164]  So really, our new slogan is, get your news years, months, or days before anybody else.
[01:37:45.164 --> 01:37:46.146]  Infowars.com.
[01:37:46.952 --> 01:37:49.453]  InfoWars.com, you heard it here first.
[01:37:49.453 --> 01:37:51.593]  InfoWars.com, the rest of the story.
[01:37:51.593 --> 01:37:54.394]  Let's rip off Paul Harvey, good day.
[01:37:54.394 --> 01:37:57.195]  No, InfoWars.com is getting to the bottom of the story.
[01:37:57.195 --> 01:38:00.436]  There you go, InfoWars.com, to get to the bottom of the story.
[01:38:00.436 --> 01:38:01.376]  There's one.
[01:38:01.376 --> 01:38:03.457]  InfoWars, I'm gonna have liners for this.
[01:38:03.457 --> 01:38:09.378]  InfoWars.com, get your news days, weeks, or years ahead of anybody else.
[01:38:09.378 --> 01:38:10.359]  That's the reality.
[01:38:10.359 --> 01:38:11.559]  So, we told you about Kushner.
[01:38:13.499 --> 01:38:20.302]  Jared Kushner left a law office financial disclosure funded by George Soros, funded by Goldman Sachs, New York Post.
[01:38:20.302 --> 01:38:26.664]  Just like last hour, I had Dr. Corsi on, but they had the Treasury confirming our two-month-plus-old story that we broke exclusively.
[01:38:26.664 --> 01:38:37.748]  We're actually getting credit that with the documents, of course it was real, that they stole upwards of $300 billion from taxpayers to fund Obamacare out of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac.
[01:38:37.748 --> 01:38:38.589]  Boom!
[01:38:38.589 --> 01:38:39.849]  Took all the profit out of it.
[01:38:39.849 --> 01:38:41.450]  Stole it!
[01:38:41.450 --> 01:38:41.790]  Illegal!
[01:38:42.742 --> 01:38:45.244]  Not supposed to do that!
[01:38:45.244 --> 01:38:47.386]  Again, I'm not sitting here tooting our horn about all the stuff we break.
[01:38:47.386 --> 01:38:50.768]  Normally, I'm just breaking the next story so fast I don't even give ourselves credit.
[01:38:50.768 --> 01:38:51.949]  But we're fake!
[01:38:51.949 --> 01:38:52.530]  We're evil!
[01:38:52.530 --> 01:38:53.070]  I'm an actor!
[01:38:53.070 --> 01:38:53.971]  I don't mean what I'm saying!
[01:38:53.971 --> 01:39:07.882]  I guess that was a psychic oracle, then, the actor I play, when we said Commissioner's on the payroll of the Communist Chinese and the Goldman Sachs and, of course, George Soros, the 200-plus mil, just from Soros-y.
[01:39:09.028 --> 01:39:12.690]  And I guess we're just psychic getting those bank documents and those lawsuit seal documents.
[01:39:12.690 --> 01:39:16.952]  I guess we just magically, that was just another thing I made up.
[01:39:16.952 --> 01:39:20.993]  Last Friday, telling you that they had a meeting that day, deciding to up the war in Afghanistan.
[01:39:20.993 --> 01:39:22.294]  It broke on Monday.
[01:39:22.294 --> 01:39:23.074]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:39:23.074 --> 01:39:35.280]  We're telling you, with our guest, another great investigative journalist like Cernovich, that it was Powers and others that were over there leaking the information.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.081]  It just goes on and on and on.
[01:39:39.081 --> 01:39:42.682]  Now I'm going to go to our next guest, so I appreciate joining us here just a moment.
[01:39:42.682 --> 01:39:45.383]  But first off, we're doing a 30-hour broadcast.
[01:39:45.383 --> 01:39:47.744]  We're an hour and 39 minutes into it right now.
[01:39:47.744 --> 01:39:52.366]  We're going right through 5, 6 o'clock tomorrow, because Google
[01:39:53.524 --> 01:39:57.687]  When AdRoll delisted us, we brought in $3.3 million.
[01:39:57.687 --> 01:39:58.447]  Sounds like a lot.
[01:39:58.447 --> 01:40:04.151]  You got 60, 70 people, a bunch of reporters, airline tickets, servers, legal, stuff like that.
[01:40:04.151 --> 01:40:04.891]  It's nothing.
[01:40:04.891 --> 01:40:07.293]  We brought in $3.3 million last year.
[01:40:07.293 --> 01:40:13.016]  It was set via AdRoll on the graphs to be $5 million this year.
[01:40:13.016 --> 01:40:14.557]  Off outside advertising.
[01:40:14.557 --> 01:40:20.781]  Advertising products I sell on the internet to fund this operation.
[01:40:20.781 --> 01:40:21.302]  They took it away.
[01:40:22.825 --> 01:40:34.112]  The 3.3 million, strangely enough, was about 3.5 is what we had budgeted this year to expand and set up a DC Bureau, a London Bureau, hire six, seven more people here, put in the infrastructure.
[01:40:34.112 --> 01:40:34.832]  They took that away.
[01:40:34.832 --> 01:40:37.854]  We've been trying the last four months since that happened to get that money back.
[01:40:37.854 --> 01:40:39.855]  We still haven't quite gotten there, but we're close.
[01:40:39.855 --> 01:40:49.301]  But as I knew, they hit us with the Federal Reserve Board member lawsuit funded by and run by George Soros' founded law firm.
[01:40:50.285 --> 01:40:54.489]  Now, my lawyers say it's just purely to weigh us down in a publicity stunt, but I've still got to defend against it.
[01:40:54.489 --> 01:40:56.872]  And they let me know, too, others are on the way.
[01:40:56.872 --> 01:40:58.133]  More missiles are on their way.
[01:40:58.133 --> 01:41:03.539]  Well, we expect that because we are death-dealing in the info war of these people.
[01:41:03.539 --> 01:41:04.960]  We are dominating them.
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:06.322]  We are annihilating them.
[01:41:06.322 --> 01:41:09.285]  We are crushing these Nazi collaborators like Soros.
[01:41:11.414 --> 01:41:14.035]  They just can't believe someone will actually call their bluff and stand up against them.

[01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:34.401]  It's got to be somewhere on there.
[01:41:34.401 --> 01:41:35.602]  People tell me they can't find it.

[01:42:36.658 --> 01:42:41.962]  It's so limited, the amounts of this, the BioPQQ we can get, that it is a limited run and will sell out again.
[01:42:41.962 --> 01:42:43.122]  That's a big problem.

[01:42:59.653 --> 01:43:00.214]  Don't wait.
[01:43:00.214 --> 01:43:01.455]  Don't hold back.
[01:43:01.455 --> 01:43:02.315]  Take action.
[01:43:02.315 --> 01:43:06.258]  Now, I'm always interrupting Dr. Grew, so I'm going to let him talk for about 10 minutes before I interrupt him.
[01:43:06.858 --> 01:43:17.864]  With all the big topics, all the big stories that are taking place, all the big developments in nutraceuticals, all the different developments in the world, just everything he's talked about for decades is now coming out in the news.
[01:43:17.864 --> 01:43:19.264]  It's amazing.
[01:43:19.264 --> 01:43:26.908]  So I wanted to have Dr. Group on just to talk about some of the basic developments in the world today, and then in the next hour we've got a bunch of guests as well.
[01:43:26.908 --> 01:43:29.990]  But Dr. Group, I'm going to give you the floor until we've got a break.
[01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:31.571]  What's front and center on your screen today?
[01:43:32.813 --> 01:43:46.135]  Well, because you're doing your 30 hour special, you know, looking back I was just thinking how much free speech has been suppressed in the natural medicine industry.
[01:43:46.135 --> 01:44:00.618]  Going back to the AMA, the creation of the American Medical Association, all of the corruption within the FDA, the Federal Drug Administration, all of the lobbying that's there, the suppression of natural medicine,
[01:44:01.698 --> 01:44:28.114]  The attack on doctors all across the world who have developed complete remission programs, whether it's one product or whether it's a system of detoxification, talking with these doctors all for years, for 20 years, you talking with the doctors for over 20 years, to seeing the amount of pressure on free speech, being able to say,
[01:44:28.934 --> 01:44:36.040]  We've worked with thousands of patients with this protocol and we've gotten 89, 90% success rates.
[01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:43.466]  Why on earth aren't these technologies, aren't these systems being placed in all hospitals today?
[01:44:43.466 --> 01:44:47.129]  Why aren't doctors being educated on natural medicine?
[01:44:47.129 --> 01:44:49.211]  Why is there such a suppression?
[01:44:49.211 --> 01:44:51.512]  Why is there such an attack from the FTC?
[01:44:52.553 --> 01:45:01.680]  On regular consumers out there that are using products, not necessarily product manufacturing companies, but consumers.
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:18.453]  I mean, companies are now the FDA is actually issuing warning letters to companies because consumers are going online and placing five star reviews and talking about the success that they had using the product.
[01:45:18.453 --> 01:45:21.295]  I mean, in being censored from that is
[01:45:23.336 --> 01:45:34.407]  You know, doctors have been killed, doctors have been put out of business, doctors are in massive amounts of lawsuits, just like it is with the independent media out there.
[01:45:34.407 --> 01:45:44.897]  But natural medicine, chiropractic, massage therapy, colon hydrotherapy, all of the springs, the healing springs and spas that were closed down in the
[01:45:46.408 --> 01:45:57.656]  Early 1900s that were used where people would go and drink pure clean water and fast for a few days to get rid of whatever condition they were suffering from, you know, all of these things are being suppressed.
[01:45:57.656 --> 01:46:12.027]  Of course we know why they're being suppressed because there's so much money in pharmaceuticals and that's what I was really hoping that this administration would do something about that, would address the root cause of the problem, but
[01:46:12.467 --> 01:46:14.489]  Alex, you know, it's always been we the people.
[01:46:14.489 --> 01:46:30.479]  If you look at all of the change that's taken place in the last 15, 20 years, all of your listeners that continue to grow on a daily basis, you know, all the attacks that we're getting on a daily, weekly basis, it is becoming mainstream.
[01:46:30.479 --> 01:46:35.223]  And thank God that people are waking up and they are looking for answers.
[01:46:35.843 --> 01:46:37.764]  They've seen their grandparents die.
[01:46:37.764 --> 01:46:41.447]  They've seen their parents that are on multiple pharmaceuticals.
[01:46:41.447 --> 01:46:47.690]  And it's all about addressing the root cause of the problem, which we try to lay out to people.
[01:46:47.690 --> 01:46:53.494]  If you understand that there's fluoride and chlorine and bromine and a million other chemicals in the water supply,
[01:46:53.994 --> 01:46:58.395]  You know that you need to either get a filtration system or drink clean water.
[01:46:58.395 --> 01:47:13.640]  You know that the food supply is contaminated because we've gone over in detail all of the compounds that are in the food that you need to look out for the artificial colors and sweeteners and high fructose corn syrup and the genetically modified foods and you can make those conscious decisions.
[01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:20.528]  Start making those decisions and implementing those things into your life on a regular basis.
[01:47:20.528 --> 01:47:25.734]  Just every single decision that you make, it's a combination of all those
[01:47:28.294 --> 01:47:35.923]  20, 30, 40 health giving decisions that are going to lead up to the big changes that take place in your life.
[01:47:44.833 --> 01:47:45.033]  Yeah.
[01:48:05.768 --> 01:48:13.294]  You know, in your cancer clinics 20 years ago is about vitamin C intravenously, ozone intravenously, stuff you were pioneering.
[01:48:13.294 --> 01:48:19.398]  The media makes fun of you and only looks at one of your certificates for chiropractic, not all the others, as if chiropractic is bad.
[01:48:19.398 --> 01:48:25.843]  Everything you've been talking about for 20 years is now the mainline elite clinics that the MDs are using with three degrees.
[01:48:27.805 --> 01:48:30.368]  That's right, and that's the good news.
[01:48:30.368 --> 01:48:48.068]  The question is, at what point are they going to lay off or what point are they going to be letting people, individual consumers, talk about how they've gotten better through detoxification and through cleansing and through reactivating their body's self-healing mechanism.
[01:48:48.829 --> 01:48:58.478]  Through taking the supplements that InfoWars Life Supplements are not just supplements that we go out and we copy everybody else online about.
[01:48:58.478 --> 01:49:05.524]  When we looked at the root cause of disease and we still study that 20 years later, it's all about that.
[01:49:05.524 --> 01:49:07.526]  No one else is out there doing that.
[01:49:07.526 --> 01:49:10.229]  The research companies that are out there researching
[01:49:10.569 --> 01:49:12.531]  Pharmaceutical man-made compounds.
[01:49:12.531 --> 01:49:20.317]  What we're looking at is how does the body heal naturally through sunlight, through clean water, through clean food, through boosting the immune system.
[01:49:20.317 --> 01:49:28.124]  Now the University of California out there came out and said fasting for 72 hours completely regenerates.
[01:49:28.124 --> 01:49:30.266]  You always said do it for three to four days and let me expand.
[01:49:30.626 --> 01:49:32.748]  I've lost almost 70, 80 pounds.
[01:49:32.748 --> 01:49:34.249]  I still have a super stressful life.
[01:49:34.249 --> 01:49:36.330]  I work out less and I'm in better shape.
[01:49:36.330 --> 01:49:40.673]  I never say I'm a beach boy, but I look like a beach boy compared to the way I looked four or five years ago.
[01:49:40.673 --> 01:49:47.758]  And it was all the nutraceuticals and people get them and we get five star reviews by the thousands and then we get complaints, you know, in New York and stuff to their
[01:49:48.198 --> 01:50:01.749]  Inspector General calling the big third-party sites that are respected and they just laugh because we really do have thousands of five-star reviews per product and it totally freaks people out that they can't believe that Mother Nature is this powerful.
[01:50:01.749 --> 01:50:14.238]  I mean they are so upset at this Dr. Group that you know that I've gone from looking like Jabba the Hutt five years ago till you know when I'm sitting there with my shirt off I look like I look like Fred Flintstone but my belly's 10% of what it used to be.
[01:50:14.238 --> 01:50:14.999]  It's almost gone.
[01:50:16.872 --> 01:50:28.036]  Well, it's identifying, what we do is we identify what's currently going on in politics and behind the scenes in the government and what's going on with the suppression of natural medicine.
[01:50:28.036 --> 01:50:36.239]  And we look at what we're seeing major, I just say epidemic all the time, but just what massive amounts of people are suffering from.
[01:50:36.239 --> 01:50:42.802]  So you identify the fact that there's massive amounts of fluoride and chlorine and bromine in the food, and what does that lead to?
[01:50:42.802 --> 01:50:45.983]  It leads to massive iodine deficiency all over the globe.
[01:50:46.243 --> 01:50:48.485]  And people that have that tend to be obese.
[01:50:48.485 --> 01:50:51.588]  Why is being toxic tend to make you so obese and blow up?
[01:50:51.588 --> 01:50:54.691]  Is that your cells trying to hold water so they don't get toxified?
[01:50:54.691 --> 01:50:55.392]  Explain that to me.
[01:50:55.392 --> 01:50:59.395]  And why are allergies globally off the charts and only getting worse?
[01:50:59.395 --> 01:51:01.778]  I mean, they're getting crippling for most people I know.
[01:51:01.778 --> 01:51:02.698]  Stay there, Dr. Group.

[01:54:42.664 --> 01:54:44.887]  When a new host comes on, go to the next fresh group.
[01:54:44.887 --> 01:54:47.891]  I'm going to really try to take a lot of calls coming up at the bottom of the next hour.
[01:54:49.130 --> 01:55:05.946]  I want to get back on soon and take your call specifically on all this, but when I set out to put out nutraceuticals and supplements, I did research and I went on the online big health sites and I looked for who was the most respected and who advised big companies on product lines.
[01:55:06.752 --> 01:55:08.674]  Whole Foods, you name it.
[01:55:08.674 --> 01:55:11.877]  And Group, as the media says, is not the only guy that advises us.
[01:55:11.877 --> 01:55:14.380]  We have three of the biggest organic makers in the country.
[01:55:14.380 --> 01:55:20.746]  A lot of our products are just private-labeled, best-selling brands that are sold in health food storage for decades.
[01:55:20.746 --> 01:55:26.232]  Like our Child Ease is just private-labeled Calm Child.
[01:55:26.232 --> 01:55:26.833]  Things like that.
[01:55:28.092 --> 01:55:29.413]  Knockout is something I came up with.
[01:55:29.413 --> 01:55:46.588]  I said, is it safe, Dr. Gripp, to take L-tryptophan, valerian root, melatonin, lemon balm, chamomile, and a few other known ingredients in Mother Nature that are associated with better sleep, fuse them together in one pill, sell it for the same price as a bottle of melatonin that's the same dose?
[01:55:47.409 --> 01:55:48.290]  For a little bitty pill.
[01:55:48.290 --> 01:55:50.652]  We have the same dose in there, but it's a big pill.
[01:55:50.652 --> 01:55:52.254]  And it's revolutionized.
[01:55:52.254 --> 01:55:57.779]  It doesn't make us a lot of money because it's so low in price, but we sell a ton of it.
[01:55:57.779 --> 01:55:59.380]  And people are crazy about it.
[01:55:59.380 --> 01:56:03.384]  So some of the stuff I came up with, checked with group, he goes, oh no, they all work together naturally.
[01:56:03.384 --> 01:56:07.348]  Because I thought if I took L-Tryptophan and
[01:56:09.196 --> 01:56:09.616]  I don't
[01:56:30.128 --> 01:56:32.109]  But everything is 20 to 30% off today.
[01:56:32.109 --> 01:56:33.931]  A lot of items have free shipping.
[01:56:33.931 --> 01:56:34.711]  Check it all out.
[01:56:34.711 --> 01:56:38.694]  InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:56:38.694 --> 01:56:41.977]  Dr. Group, where do you see this going?
[01:56:41.977 --> 01:56:43.238]  They're trying to censor us.
[01:56:43.238 --> 01:56:44.779]  They're openly trying to shut down InfoWars.
[01:56:44.779 --> 01:56:45.920]  They've tried to shut you down before.
[01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:49.702]  But everything you've talked about literally is being admitted now.
[01:56:49.702 --> 01:56:54.706]  I think we've already kind of passed the tipping point and the dinosaur system doesn't realize it's dead already.
[01:56:54.706 --> 01:56:55.827]  Or am I being too optimistic?
[01:56:57.588 --> 01:56:59.289]  Well, it's always good to be optimistic.
[01:56:59.289 --> 01:57:01.071]  You know, we have to stay optimistic.
[01:57:01.071 --> 01:57:15.302]  And I think that the more education that we give people, the more people wake up and the more people realize that it's the people that are going to create the change, just like what happened with the labeling of the GMOs.
[01:57:15.302 --> 01:57:21.187]  And recently I was on the show and we were talking about the fungus epidemic and we both got, you know, blasted for that.
[01:57:21.647 --> 01:57:28.737]  Well just yesterday the Philadelphia Tribune came out with a main article that said fatal fungus linked to death.
[01:57:28.737 --> 01:57:37.709]  What you need to know and anyone can now go on the CDC website and the CDC is now claiming that there's a new strain of a drug-resistant yeast infection that's been
[01:57:38.490 --> 01:57:40.371]  Let me just stop you.
[01:57:40.371 --> 01:57:41.191]  Let me just stop you.
[01:57:41.191 --> 01:57:47.333]  It's known at clinics and doctors I know everywhere that fungus and mold is killing everybody in Austin.
[01:57:47.333 --> 01:57:48.434]  It's blowing around everywhere.
[01:57:48.434 --> 01:57:49.854]  It's out of control.
[01:57:49.854 --> 01:57:56.217]  I met two cops, one of which died, the other which had medical retirement but still did bodyguard work.
[01:57:56.217 --> 01:58:00.959]  They went in one crack house that had a deadly mold in it and it almost killed them both.
[01:58:00.959 --> 01:58:02.359]  One exposure.
[01:58:02.359 --> 01:58:04.280]  And again, it's mutating.
[01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:05.741]  Do we know why it's mutating?
[01:58:06.821 --> 01:58:10.470]  I read all the time about people getting brain tumors from mold or fungus now.
[01:58:10.470 --> 01:58:11.312]  What is going on?
[01:58:13.223 --> 01:58:16.045]  Well, we just know that it can travel long distances.
[01:58:16.045 --> 01:58:21.988]  Some of it is a spore, so it can sit dormant for a long period of time.
[01:58:21.988 --> 01:58:25.150]  I don't think anybody really knows the true answer to why that's taking place.
[01:58:25.150 --> 01:58:25.790]  It's killing all the bats.
[01:58:25.790 --> 01:58:26.070]  Stay there.
[01:58:26.070 --> 01:58:26.711]  We're back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:26.711 --> 01:58:28.072]  Two, five more minutes, and I'm going to shut up.
[01:58:28.072 --> 01:58:30.173]  I want to ask you, because you just mentioned the Philadelphia news.
[01:58:30.173 --> 01:58:30.993]  We just pulled it up.
[01:58:30.993 --> 01:58:31.614]  Just what you said.
[01:58:31.614 --> 01:58:34.195]  It's in the news 50 times a day.
[01:58:34.195 --> 01:58:35.996]  Scientists saying it's mutating.
[01:58:35.996 --> 01:58:36.797]  It's killing people.
[01:58:36.797 --> 01:58:38.077]  It's killing animals.
[01:58:38.077 --> 01:58:38.958]  What is going on?
[01:58:38.958 --> 01:58:40.139]  It's hurting me.
[01:58:41.119 --> 01:58:45.806]  I mean, I want, and then the media, yeah, wrote big hit pieces saying we're kooks because we don't want to die.
[01:58:45.806 --> 01:58:50.051]  I mean, you know, and we sell an antifungal that's just like a probiotic.
[01:58:50.051 --> 01:58:53.636]  That, by the way, I've got a bunch of crew members that had irritable bowel until they took it.
[01:58:53.636 --> 01:58:54.096]  It's gone.
[01:58:56.482 --> 01:58:58.303]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[01:58:58.303 --> 01:59:04.906]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[01:59:04.906 --> 01:59:08.067]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:08.067 --> 01:59:17.851]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[01:59:17.851 --> 01:59:18.692]  Caveman.
[01:59:18.692 --> 01:59:23.774]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[01:59:23.774 --> 01:59:25.875]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[01:59:26.175 --> 01:59:29.316]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[01:59:29.316 --> 01:59:34.457]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[01:59:34.457 --> 01:59:42.519]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[01:59:42.519 --> 01:59:50.462]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[01:59:50.462 --> 01:59:55.203]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and fullworldslife.com today.
[01:59:58.755 --> 02:00:01.339]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:16.946 --> 02:00:21.290]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:21.290 --> 02:00:23.652]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:00:42.782 --> 02:00:46.603]  I'd go to an allergy doctor, because Austin's the capital of allergies.
[02:00:46.603 --> 02:00:49.744]  Tennessee's real bad too, areas of Tennessee like Knoxville.
[02:00:49.744 --> 02:00:54.685]  But you can debate it, but they say Austin's the worst in the country because there's so many different types of plants.
[02:00:54.685 --> 02:01:03.027]  And in the buildings, in the big cities next to the jungle that Austin is, mold and fungus are just breeding, mutating.
[02:01:03.027 --> 02:01:08.729]  They believe GMO crops are mutating with it, that's been confirmed, with the different floras now mixing together.
[02:01:10.043 --> 02:01:17.208]  Because you start splicing other plants and animals with other plants, it opens them up out of their species to be able to basically mutate faster.
[02:01:17.208 --> 02:01:20.711]  But there's the Philadelphia Tribune, fungus linked to deaths, what you need to know.
[02:01:20.711 --> 02:01:22.132]  I mean, it's everywhere.
[02:01:22.132 --> 02:01:26.796]  And I go to the clinic and it's people basically almost dying from fungus.
[02:01:26.796 --> 02:01:30.879]  And when the mold goes up, almost everybody I know has huge headaches, you can't breathe.
[02:01:30.879 --> 02:01:31.819]  I've talked about this.
[02:01:31.819 --> 02:01:38.965]  Then they have Vox and others say, Jones and his doctor group make up a fungus epidemic and have to have a pill to treat it.
[02:01:39.844 --> 02:01:40.785]  What?
[02:01:40.785 --> 02:01:41.886]  Just like probiotics.
[02:01:41.886 --> 02:01:43.447]  Yeah, we sell a high-quality probiotic.
[02:01:43.447 --> 02:01:44.448]  Things we need.
[02:01:44.448 --> 02:01:45.349]  Things we use.
[02:01:45.349 --> 02:01:52.175]  And then they make a joke about antifungal when Bill Gates admits most of his new funding is into antifunguses for the gut.
[02:01:52.175 --> 02:01:55.939]  He believes drugs in that area will be the biggest seller in the future.
[02:01:55.939 --> 02:01:57.460]  So Bill Gates does it, and it's okay.
[02:01:57.460 --> 02:01:58.521]  But we do.
[02:01:58.521 --> 02:01:59.843]  We're bad, Dr. Group.
[02:01:59.843 --> 02:02:01.844]  What is causing it to get so crazy?
[02:02:01.844 --> 02:02:04.186]  I mean, 20 years ago, almost nobody had allergies.
[02:02:04.186 --> 02:02:04.927]  Now it's epidemic.
[02:02:04.927 --> 02:02:05.568]  What's going on?
[02:02:07.272 --> 02:02:09.133]  Well, I'll try to look at that.
[02:02:09.133 --> 02:02:10.694]  I think a lot of different factors.
[02:02:10.694 --> 02:02:13.395]  Number one, people's bodies are toxic.
[02:02:13.395 --> 02:02:17.017]  Their pH levels are off, which means their body is ripe.
[02:02:17.017 --> 02:02:17.758]  It's damp.
[02:02:17.758 --> 02:02:19.519]  It's diseased.
[02:02:19.519 --> 02:02:20.199]  It's dark.
[02:02:20.199 --> 02:02:23.040]  They have a lot of cells that aren't working at 100%.
[02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:27.062]  Their immune systems are suppressed because of everything that they're exposed to.
[02:02:27.062 --> 02:02:27.563]  We're rundown.
[02:02:28.303 --> 02:02:29.344]  So yeah, exactly.
[02:02:29.344 --> 02:02:36.429]  With all the amounts of stress that people are under right now, their immune systems are working at, you know, 30, 40, 50 percent.
[02:02:36.429 --> 02:02:45.637]  So you're not able to attack the fungus, which again leads back to, you know, keeping yourself clean, eating clean food, detoxifying yourself on a regular basis.
[02:02:46.397 --> 02:02:50.765]  The fungus out there, there's a lot of different types that can mix with each other.
[02:02:50.765 --> 02:02:53.870]  It's basically like a plague that's going on.
[02:02:53.870 --> 02:02:57.938]  And really... They admit most of the bats are dying.
[02:02:57.938 --> 02:02:59.500]  Most of the bats are dying from fungus.
[02:03:01.024 --> 02:03:06.270]  And with people, one of the main things we found is that doctors don't know how to diagnose it.
[02:03:06.270 --> 02:03:07.652]  They're not testing for it.
[02:03:07.652 --> 02:03:18.745]  I mean, if there was a standard test that we could run on everybody, a blood test and a urine test, let's say, to test for a broad range of fungus and mold and yeast, I'm sure that the majority of people out there
[02:03:19.326 --> 02:03:19.466]  Yes.
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:41.541]  And then they actually find out that they have it.
[02:03:41.541 --> 02:03:47.343]  But regardless of what anyone's dealing with, Alex, you could pretty much trace everything back to a healthy gut.
[02:03:47.343 --> 02:04:01.489]  And that's why with the Biome Defense, you know, taking care of your endocrine system with the X2, the Biome Defense, all the supplements that you need, the winter sun, vitamin D. Is our micro-ZX any fungal even back in?
[02:04:01.489 --> 02:04:01.869]  What's that?
[02:04:01.869 --> 02:04:03.690]  Are we still sold out of the micro-ZX?
[02:04:05.154 --> 02:04:07.095]  You are sold out of the MEIKO ZX.
[02:04:07.095 --> 02:04:09.196]  We're working as hard as we possibly can.
[02:04:09.196 --> 02:04:11.717]  People are understanding what's out there and people want it.
[02:04:11.717 --> 02:04:12.918]  We're ramping up production.
[02:04:12.918 --> 02:04:23.303]  We're about to move into our new manufacturing facility, are moving in this month, which is going to give us the ability to produce 10 times, 15 times the amount of production.
[02:04:23.303 --> 02:04:25.724]  That's why they're so scared, because we're exploding and they know it.
[02:04:26.874 --> 02:04:34.603]  Right, we're helping people, and helping people wakes people up, because you're decalcifying... Oh, you know how much more people love us when they get X2 and it changes their life?
[02:04:34.603 --> 02:04:36.285]  I mean, this is real stuff!
[02:04:36.285 --> 02:04:38.928]  They're hitting us with all the bad halogens, we've got the good halogen.
[02:04:38.928 --> 02:04:39.569]  It's a win-win!
[02:04:41.331 --> 02:04:45.714]  Right, because you understand what's causing your problem, and that's what should be taught to everybody.
[02:04:45.714 --> 02:04:51.259]  Understand that you do have a self-healing mechanism, that you do not have to run to the doctor's office for every condition.
[02:04:51.259 --> 02:04:54.581]  I've gotten so much better since I took the MycoZx.
[02:04:54.581 --> 02:04:55.502]  It's just amazing.
[02:04:55.502 --> 02:04:58.344]  But I gotta tell you, it hasn't knocked it out of my sinus, though.
[02:04:58.344 --> 02:04:59.605]  So we need to talk about something to do that.
[02:04:59.605 --> 02:05:01.146]  Dr. Group, thank you so much.
[02:05:01.146 --> 02:05:01.667]  We love you.
[02:05:01.667 --> 02:05:02.887]  You're so amazing.
[02:05:02.887 --> 02:05:03.488]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:03.488 --> 02:05:04.128]  Stay with us.
[02:05:04.128 --> 02:05:04.449]  Thank you.
[02:05:06.161 --> 02:05:09.924]  What exactly is political correctness, and why is it being pushed on the American public?
[02:05:09.924 --> 02:05:16.109]  Well, political correctness is simply a form of psychological manipulation the government uses to control public opinion.
[02:05:16.109 --> 02:05:25.056]  By controlling your opinions, the establishment gets you to not only agree with their agenda, but to also ensure that your government-created viewpoint also influences others in a ripple effect.
[02:05:25.276 --> 02:05:27.697]  This is how the power elite and the government stay in power.
[02:05:27.697 --> 02:05:31.560]  They use psychological manipulation to turn the public into obedient sheeple.
[02:05:31.560 --> 02:05:35.242]  And over time, we lose our ability to distinguish reality from deception.
[02:05:35.242 --> 02:05:38.643]  But how does political correctness and other deliberate deceptions work?
[02:05:38.643 --> 02:05:47.188]  Well, first, the establishment saturates mass media with their agenda they're trying to push until it invades every aspect of popular culture and is accepted as truth.
[02:05:47.188 --> 02:05:48.669]  Such as global warming, for example.
[02:05:48.869 --> 02:05:58.036]  Then the establishment suppresses any counter-arguments to their agenda by calling critics kooky, nutjobs, racists, or in the case of man-made climate change, climate deniers.
[02:05:58.036 --> 02:06:04.561]  You can learn more about this tyranny over the minds of men at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and our YouTube channel, Resistance News.
[02:06:04.561 --> 02:06:05.742]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[02:06:06.002 --> 02:06:11.468]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue Fluoride Toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:06:11.468 --> 02:06:13.550]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:06:13.550 --> 02:06:18.835]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:06:18.835 --> 02:06:22.379]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[02:06:22.679 --> 02:06:26.141]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:06:26.141 --> 02:06:29.323]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[02:06:29.323 --> 02:06:33.205]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:06:33.205 --> 02:06:40.370]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:06:40.370 --> 02:06:45.753]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[02:06:46.013 --> 02:06:48.075]  Iodine, nanosilver, and more.
[02:06:48.075 --> 02:06:56.363]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubblegum-flavored Superblue that is Spearmint-free.
[02:06:56.363 --> 02:07:04.671]  Learn more about the new Bubblegum-flavored Superblue toothpaste and more at InfoWarsLife.com and support the Info War while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[02:07:05.700 --> 02:07:07.581]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[02:07:07.581 --> 02:07:09.621]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:07:09.621 --> 02:07:12.522]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:07:12.522 --> 02:07:18.583]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:07:18.583 --> 02:07:27.766]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[02:07:27.766 --> 02:07:32.627]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[02:07:32.847 --> 02:07:35.311]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:07:35.311 --> 02:07:43.342]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:07:43.342 --> 02:07:44.323]  The general public doesn't.
[02:07:45.505 --> 02:07:48.887]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:07:48.887 --> 02:07:53.030]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:07:53.030 --> 02:07:59.735]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:07:59.735 --> 02:08:03.838]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:08:22.993 --> 02:08:28.496]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:28.496 --> 02:08:37.860]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:37.860 --> 02:08:38.540]  Alright!
[02:08:39.642 --> 02:08:45.788]  Catherine Austin Fitts worked at very, very high levels inside the federal government.
[02:08:45.788 --> 02:08:47.269]  I think our computer's having a malfunction.
[02:08:47.269 --> 02:08:48.731]  I don't think we're doing that on purpose there.
[02:08:48.731 --> 02:08:51.834]  It's gonna make me have a seizure here in a second.
[02:08:51.834 --> 02:08:53.355]  But we are in the middle of our
[02:08:54.932 --> 02:09:09.678]  30-hour global live transmission in defense of Western Renaissance, of true liberal Western values, that means low taxes, religious freedom, national sovereignty, against the neocon, rhino, Republican, Democrat establishment.
[02:09:09.678 --> 02:09:24.264]  Donald Trump was doing really good for nationalism, killing TPP, getting us to be proud to be Americans again, and then he started going off sideways around day 70, as soon as Steve Bannon got basically
[02:09:25.612 --> 02:09:26.633]  Taken to the woodshed.
[02:09:26.633 --> 02:09:35.701]  Catherine Austin Fitz is president of Solari Group, publisher of the Solari Report, which is a beautiful magazine and full of information.
[02:09:35.701 --> 02:09:49.813]  She served as a managing director and member of the board of directors of the Wall Street Investment Bank, Dillon Reed & Co, Inc., and assistant secretary of housing and federal housing commissioner at the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development in the first Bush administration and was the president of Hamilton Securities Group.
[02:09:50.413 --> 02:09:59.637]  Catherine has designed and closed over $25 billion in transactions and investments to date, and has a lead portfolio investment strategy of $300 billion of financial assets and liabilities.
[02:09:59.637 --> 02:10:08.681]  Catherine graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and Worlton School, with her MBA, and studied Mandarin Chinese at the Chinese University in Hong Kong.
[02:10:08.681 --> 02:10:10.141]  Solari.com.
[02:10:10.141 --> 02:10:11.362]  I was thinking, we've got to get her on.
[02:10:11.362 --> 02:10:13.643]  It's been a couple of years, as time flashes by.
[02:10:13.643 --> 02:10:16.484]  We need to get her on every month, if she'll do it.
[02:10:16.484 --> 02:10:18.585]  I've sent crew out to interview her, you name it.
[02:10:19.551 --> 02:10:32.000]  But it's great to have her on because just today we've learned that the Treasury Secretary Mnuchin admits that our reports from Dr. Corsi two months ago that they've raided Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under Obama to pay for Obamacare.
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:32.520]  That's true.
[02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:36.283]  She's an expert on that, obviously being with HUD.
[02:10:36.283 --> 02:10:39.125]  And we've got this teetering economy.
[02:10:39.125 --> 02:10:40.686]  We got Trump trying to prop it up.
[02:10:40.686 --> 02:10:44.689]  You've got Jared Kushner on the Soros payroll.
[02:10:44.689 --> 02:10:48.392]  You've got just all this craziness going on, all these talk of war coming up.
[02:10:49.966 --> 02:10:52.628]  It's just a crazy, crazy time to be alive.
[02:10:52.628 --> 02:10:56.091]  So I appreciate her coming on to discuss all this.
[02:10:56.091 --> 02:10:59.674]  Just the state of the world, where she sees this going.
[02:10:59.674 --> 02:11:02.456]  Catherine, great to have you with us.
[02:11:02.456 --> 02:11:03.697]  Alex, it's great to be on.
[02:11:03.697 --> 02:11:05.118]  You're doing great things.
[02:11:05.118 --> 02:11:06.339]  You're doing great things.
[02:11:06.339 --> 02:11:07.240]  Where do you want to start?
[02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:08.861]  I mean, you're the banking expert here.
[02:11:08.861 --> 02:11:12.644]  State of the world, what's happening with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, what you think of Trump.
[02:11:12.644 --> 02:11:14.566]  I mean, what's your view?
[02:11:14.566 --> 02:11:17.108]  So hold up the cover of our wrap-up.
[02:11:18.103 --> 02:11:20.166]  Can you hold up the cover of our wrap-up?
[02:11:20.166 --> 02:11:20.627]  Yes, I can.
[02:11:20.627 --> 02:11:22.109]  It's right here.
[02:11:22.109 --> 02:11:24.953]  Okay, so what's the question it asks?
[02:11:24.953 --> 02:11:31.684]  It asks, can a new administration preserve a prosperous economy without more debt, crime, and war?
[02:11:31.684 --> 02:11:33.006]  With a dove on the front.
[02:11:34.642 --> 02:11:35.883]  Exactly.
[02:11:35.883 --> 02:11:44.446]  So the question is, Donald Trump became president and walked into a machinery that is totally dependent on a war economy.
[02:11:44.446 --> 02:11:54.870]  And what has happened is, you know, he was doing great for about 70 days and now he's done a variety of U-turns and it looks like the war economy has taken over.
[02:11:54.870 --> 02:11:56.951]  Do you remember my red button story?
[02:11:56.951 --> 02:11:58.812]  Yes.
[02:11:58.812 --> 02:12:00.232]  Let's tell the red button story again.
[02:12:00.232 --> 02:12:01.253]  You haven't told it in a few years here.
[02:12:02.799 --> 02:12:21.056]  I was talking to a group of wonderful people called Spiritual Frontiers Foundation International, and this was in 2000, and we were talking about the congressional testimony on allegations of the intelligence agencies selling narcotics into South Central LA.
[02:12:21.056 --> 02:12:22.117]  So I said to them,
[02:12:23.496 --> 02:12:27.939]  You know, at the time, a Department of Justice spokesperson told a report I was working with that the U.S.
[02:12:27.939 --> 02:12:33.464]  economy launders $500 billion to a trillion dollars a year of all dirty money.
[02:12:33.464 --> 02:12:44.312]  So I said to this wonderful group of spiritually evolved people, what would happen if we stopped being the global leader on laundering $500 billion to a trillion dollars a year of money?
[02:12:44.312 --> 02:12:47.815]  And we had a little conversation and they said, we know we have trouble keeping
[02:12:48.275 --> 02:13:03.513]  The stock market up that money would go to London or Zurich or Hong Kong and we have trouble financing the government deficit and I said okay let's pretend there's a big red button up here on the lectern and if you push that button you can stop all hard narcotics trafficking in your county
[02:13:04.073 --> 02:13:11.375]  Your city, your town, your state tomorrow, thus offending the people who control 500 billion to a trillion dollars of all dirty money.
[02:13:11.375 --> 02:13:18.717]  And out of a hundred people dedicated to evolving our society spiritually, the point of the conference, only one would push the button.
[02:13:18.717 --> 02:13:21.618]  So I said to the other 99, now, why would you not push the button?
[02:13:21.618 --> 02:13:24.659]  And they said, we don't want our government checks to stop.
[02:13:24.659 --> 02:13:27.720]  We don't want our taxes to go up and we don't want our IRAs and 401ks to go down.
[02:13:29.648 --> 02:13:38.333]  So the whole issue for the Trump administration is the genius of corruption because they get us into a system like cancer that's into our heart.
[02:13:38.333 --> 02:13:39.954]  You cut it out, you bleed to death.
[02:13:39.954 --> 02:13:44.657]  I mean, that's kind of a layman way of saying it, but it's really the mystery of evil.
[02:13:46.084 --> 02:13:46.704]  The U.S.
[02:13:46.704 --> 02:13:51.766]  economy is addicted to the war economy and to dirty money.
[02:13:51.766 --> 02:13:59.868]  And you can't drain the swamp in Washington unless 3,100 counties in America are willing to drain the swamp one county at a time.
[02:13:59.868 --> 02:14:03.769]  Because the swamp is from sea to shining sea.
[02:14:03.769 --> 02:14:07.971]  So the answer is, this is very profound, we are the swamp.
[02:14:07.971 --> 02:14:10.311]  Drudge says that the swamp is draining Trump.
[02:14:10.311 --> 02:14:12.032]  Isn't it just that we are the swamp?
[02:14:13.459 --> 02:14:15.320]  The swamp is draining Trump.
[02:14:15.320 --> 02:14:21.662]  Trump can drain a lot of swamp from Washington on any issue where he has an 80% or higher consensus.
[02:14:21.662 --> 02:14:27.084]  But he doesn't have an 80% higher consensus, which makes him a prisoner of the machinery.
[02:14:27.084 --> 02:14:29.425]  So the question is, how do you get out of that box?
[02:14:29.425 --> 02:14:30.906]  How do you change things?
[02:14:30.906 --> 02:14:33.287]  The way you get out of it is through the budget.
[02:14:33.287 --> 02:14:41.430]  You delegate the information on the budget to 3,100 counties and 3,100 counties help you re-engineer that budget one county at a time.
[02:14:42.011 --> 02:14:44.432]  You can't re-engineer it in Washington.
[02:14:44.432 --> 02:14:57.380]  So if we take a look at the health care system, if you look at all the constituencies who are subject to the health care budget, none of them are willing to buy into an economic situation or, you know, solution.
[02:14:57.380 --> 02:15:04.844]  So that's why the Senate and the House are just going around and around and around because their constituencies won't buy into something that works.
[02:15:04.844 --> 02:15:05.505]  That's why
[02:15:06.584 --> 02:15:17.509]  If you go to my website, it's Larry.com, I have a new commentary up called That Pesky Constitution about the President's comments on the Constitution earlier this week.
[02:15:17.509 --> 02:15:24.512]  And in it, there's a link to a letter to my Congresswoman, where I basically say, here's what you do.
[02:15:24.512 --> 02:15:32.075]  You tell all the federal agencies to publish all of their budgets on a place-based basis so we can read them by county.
[02:15:32.628 --> 02:15:36.031]  And you start to engage the general population in real solutions.
[02:15:36.031 --> 02:15:42.657]  Now, you've covered this, so you know the number one problem in the budget, what is it?
[02:15:42.657 --> 02:15:45.540]  $11.5 trillion is missing from the federal government.
[02:15:45.540 --> 02:15:46.961]  So let's go back to 1998 for the last
[02:15:49.644 --> 02:15:50.685]  20 plus years.
[02:15:50.685 --> 02:16:01.274]  What we've done, Alex, is the taxpayers have put money in and they've paid, you know, for money disappearing out the back door and those assets are owned by private parties.
[02:16:01.274 --> 02:16:08.820]  Then they've paid $6 trillion for war in the Middle East, but the private assets picked up through that are owned by private parties.
[02:16:08.820 --> 02:16:13.144]  And then finally, they've paid for all this technology through the black budget.
[02:16:13.664 --> 02:16:16.026]  And all that technology is owned by private parties.
[02:16:16.026 --> 02:16:24.592]  So if I keep putting money in a pot, but the money disappears or goes to finance somebody else's assets, I'm never going to be able to get it in balance.
[02:16:24.592 --> 02:16:43.147]  And with $11.5 trillion missing from the federal government and the federal government refusing to comply with the laws about financial statements, we're in a situation now where we've had a financial coup d'etat, the money's stolen, and now everyone in Congress doesn't want to turn to the American people and say, you know something?
[02:16:43.887 --> 02:16:46.890]  The money we're going to use for nursing homes is gone.
[02:16:46.890 --> 02:16:47.431]  Exactly.
[02:16:47.431 --> 02:16:49.773]  So how's the clock ticking?
[02:16:49.773 --> 02:16:51.294]  How long do we have?
[02:16:51.294 --> 02:16:53.216]  What happens if this doesn't fundamentally get changed?
[02:16:56.021 --> 02:16:58.984]  Well, in theory, you can keep this going forever.
[02:16:58.984 --> 02:17:07.473]  It's a matter of, it's a military and intelligence question of whether you can apply enough force domestically and internationally to hold it together forever.
[02:17:07.473 --> 02:17:10.115]  In theory, it's possible.
[02:17:10.115 --> 02:17:13.719]  That's what I've called, they've held it together with what I call the slow burn.
[02:17:13.719 --> 02:17:19.245]  But you're, you're using a system that both internationally and domestically requires more and more and more force.
[02:17:19.963 --> 02:17:23.305]  And as you can see, you're getting pushback all over the world.
[02:17:23.305 --> 02:17:25.227]  That's what the Trump election was about.
[02:17:25.227 --> 02:17:27.008]  That's what Brexit was about.
[02:17:27.008 --> 02:17:31.951]  You're getting pushback, and it's very much draining the productivity and system.
[02:17:31.951 --> 02:17:34.713]  That's why the pushback on the Trump election was so hard.
[02:17:34.713 --> 02:17:42.118]  You basically decimated productivity of individual people and a lot of small business.
[02:17:42.118 --> 02:17:47.782]  People are rebelling against globalism, but then they compromise whoever we put in because the swamp is there.
[02:17:49.548 --> 02:17:52.869]  They're not rebelling against globalization.
[02:17:52.869 --> 02:17:57.691]  Interestingly enough, globalization wants to happen for market purposes.
[02:17:57.691 --> 02:18:01.532]  They are pushing back against a system which is centralizing control.
[02:18:01.532 --> 02:18:07.074]  Sure, I meant the centralized global control system, not true globalism.
[02:18:07.074 --> 02:18:08.054]  Right, exactly.
[02:18:08.054 --> 02:18:11.055]  So what they're against is illegal.
[02:18:11.055 --> 02:18:13.576]  Basically, the federal government... I told you this story.
[02:18:13.576 --> 02:18:18.978]  I went to see the chief of staff to the chairman of the subcommittee that oversees HUD.
[02:18:20.583 --> 02:18:21.544]  And it was, I think, 2001.
[02:18:21.544 --> 02:18:29.792]  And I said to her, this was before the appropriation bills were voted out, and it was somebody I didn't know.
[02:18:29.792 --> 02:18:34.116]  And the person said, what do you think is going on at the Department of Housing and Urban Development?
[02:18:34.116 --> 02:18:35.558]  And I said, I don't know.
[02:18:35.558 --> 02:18:36.759]  What do you think is going on?
[02:18:36.759 --> 02:18:40.863]  And they looked me dead in the eye and said, HUD is being run as the criminal enterprise.
[02:18:40.863 --> 02:18:42.184]  And I said, I don't disagree.
[02:18:43.365 --> 02:18:54.292]  For HUD to be run as a criminal enterprise to engage in all the mortgage fraud that created the housing bubble, it had to be run as a criminal enterprise by the Department of Justice, the U.S.
[02:18:54.292 --> 02:19:00.536]  Treasury, the New York Fed member banks, and the big defense contractors that ran HUD.
[02:19:00.536 --> 02:19:10.202]  So you're talking about a machinery that is engaged in financing a reality which is completely different than the official reality.
[02:19:10.202 --> 02:19:12.423]  And the way I say it is we've got one budget,
[02:19:12.776 --> 02:19:19.363]  That is financing two civilizations and the second civilization is completely invisible and non-transparent.
[02:19:19.363 --> 02:19:20.944]  Exactly!
[02:19:20.944 --> 02:19:27.511]  We've got a breakaway civilization when we come back with Catherine Austin Fitts but the highest level of banking and the whole global system.
[02:19:27.511 --> 02:19:31.154]  I'm going to break down what is that breakaway civilization?
[02:19:31.154 --> 02:19:32.035]  What is its goals?
[02:19:32.035 --> 02:19:33.297]  Because more and more it talks about
[02:19:34.448 --> 02:19:41.693]  Just getting rid of the lower-level civilization, phasing us out with robotics and things, making us obsolete.
[02:19:41.693 --> 02:19:42.914]  I ask, where's all this going?
[02:19:42.914 --> 02:19:45.956]  The globalists have an exit strategy.
[02:19:45.956 --> 02:19:50.239]  And the exit strategy, the endgame, is getting rid of the majority of us.
[02:19:50.239 --> 02:19:54.302]  And a lot of the public acts like they don't care, so maybe the globalists have a right to do it.
[02:19:54.302 --> 02:19:55.363]  I've kind of gotten to that point.
[02:19:55.363 --> 02:19:56.404]  I don't support it.
[02:19:56.404 --> 02:20:01.227]  But if the public wants to be poisoned and destroyed and won't stand up for themselves, then they get what they deserve.
[02:20:01.227 --> 02:20:01.868]  I'll be right back.
[02:20:01.868 --> 02:20:02.268]  Stay with us.
[02:20:06.724 --> 02:20:09.125]  Hiring is the most challenging part of my job.
[02:20:09.125 --> 02:20:10.025]  It's really hard.
[02:20:10.025 --> 02:20:12.146]  The searching, the sorting through resumes.
[02:20:12.146 --> 02:20:14.167]  Most people don't have the right experience.
[02:20:14.167 --> 02:20:17.568]  We started using ZipRecruiter about three months ago.

[02:20:39.697 --> 02:20:42.179]  I don't know how we hired before ZipRecruiter.

[02:23:33.766 --> 02:23:35.086]  It's called the Deep State.
[02:23:35.086 --> 02:23:39.848]  Barack Obama's most loyal aides still hold office and they want to stop President Trump.
[02:23:39.848 --> 02:23:43.929]  Deep State was first revealed in the runaway New York Times bestseller Big Agenda.
[02:23:43.929 --> 02:23:49.551]  David Horowitz's Big Agenda exposes Obama's government in exile and his shocking plan.

[02:24:08.536 --> 02:24:09.897]  Catherine Austen Fitch is our guest.
[02:24:09.897 --> 02:24:11.557]  She's with us about 10 minutes in the next segment.
[02:24:11.557 --> 02:24:15.259]  I'm going to open the phones up on any issue you'd like to discuss with this live Wednesday edition.
[02:24:15.259 --> 02:24:19.521]  Solari is her website, solari.com, her magazine.
[02:24:19.521 --> 02:24:22.402]  The Solari Report is excellent.
[02:24:22.402 --> 02:24:23.262]  She's not left or right.
[02:24:23.262 --> 02:24:31.005]  She's common sense, worked in the administrations, worked at the big federal bodies, seen it all for herself, managed $300 billion.
[02:24:31.005 --> 02:24:36.448]  And everything she's been warning about since she got out of the system decades ago is now coming true.
[02:24:37.304 --> 02:24:40.552]  Reminds me of one of the managing directors at Goldman Sachs, Naomi Prenn.
[02:24:40.552 --> 02:24:42.717]  She's been mourning people for like 15 years.
[02:24:42.717 --> 02:24:45.844]  She was making a lot of money with them, but she just couldn't be part of it because it's so crazy.
[02:24:46.621 --> 02:24:52.786]  Now we see this big Dutch banker coming out and talking about how immoral it is, and how it's like just a total coldness towards humanity.
[02:24:52.786 --> 02:24:56.449]  And she was just getting to two civilizations.
[02:24:56.449 --> 02:25:08.920]  And the elites see it as a breakaway civilization where they siphon off our energy, our money, our inventions, and then build their new system that's basically invisible to us, financially, culturally, you name it, under global corporate national security.
[02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:21.710]  So, Catherine, if you can, let's get a little bit into what this breakaway civilization is doing and the fact that it admits in all its major white papers it's planning on basically replacing us with machines.
[02:25:21.710 --> 02:25:28.236]  Well, what it's trying to do is organize a global currency that
[02:25:28.875 --> 02:25:35.761]  Really impacts or really affects much greater central control through the digital systems.
[02:25:35.761 --> 02:25:46.611]  So you're really looking at a digital system creation that will work globally, primarily through the money, but the surveillance and intelligence systems are exceptionally important.
[02:25:46.611 --> 02:25:49.274]  And I think part of what you're watching going on in North Korea.
[02:25:49.741 --> 02:25:54.704]  And the Middle East is to try and get everybody into what I call the central banking warfare model.
[02:25:54.704 --> 02:25:56.184]  So that's part of it.
[02:25:56.184 --> 02:26:07.210]  The other thing is it's absolutely true that new technology is rolling out that will be as impactful as going from an agricultural society to industrial society.
[02:26:07.210 --> 02:26:10.212]  So many of the jobs we have now will be automated.
[02:26:10.212 --> 02:26:16.575]  And the question is, you know, how do you how do you how do you migrate the opportunities for income
[02:26:17.630 --> 02:26:29.493]  To the sort of the middle class in the developed world, and even globally, if you're pushing for industrializing agriculture and pushing two or three billion people out of the land into the cities, what are those people going to do?
[02:26:29.493 --> 02:26:35.234]  And so, you know, there are many opportunities for all of us to do many other things.
[02:26:35.234 --> 02:26:40.655]  But the entrepreneurial process that needs to happen is being afforded.
[02:26:40.655 --> 02:26:43.516]  That's one of the one of the things that President Trump ran on.
[02:26:43.516 --> 02:26:43.676]  So
[02:26:44.571 --> 02:26:46.552]  You know, I think you're asking the right question.
[02:26:46.552 --> 02:26:47.433]  What is the endgame?
[02:26:47.433 --> 02:26:56.759]  And the way I would say it, and we talk about it in the Solari Report, is we are really at the cusp, Alex, of deciding are we going to be a human civilization or an inhuman civilization?
[02:26:56.759 --> 02:27:05.005]  And it is absolutely imperative for all of us that believe in a human civilization to just stand and turn to this and say, no, we're not.
[02:27:05.005 --> 02:27:05.705]  We're not playing.
[02:27:05.705 --> 02:27:06.606]  We're not going along.
[02:27:08.683 --> 02:27:22.089]  I know there's more debates inside the globalist power structure now about what's actually being built, and there does seem to be more resistance even in the structure towards following through with this, but even the elites that aren't pure evil, they don't know how to get out of it.
[02:27:22.089 --> 02:27:26.171]  Like you said, presidents get captured by it, so even elites get captured by it.
[02:27:26.171 --> 02:27:31.474]  It seems like it's just an out-of-control monster, like Nixon said, it's a wild beast, a machine.
[02:27:33.809 --> 02:27:41.672]  It is a wild beast and machine and it's got its own momentum because the things that have done, you know, I always say crime that pays is crime that stays.
[02:27:41.672 --> 02:27:50.056]  Crime has worked and it has been able, we have been able through keeping this fake news cycle and an absence of financial transparency.
[02:27:50.636 --> 02:27:53.578]  To allow the people doing the crime to be the most admired.
[02:27:53.578 --> 02:27:56.501]  I've watched your frustration during the election with the Clintons.
[02:27:56.501 --> 02:28:10.451]  The Clintons are a perfect example of people who continue to be admired and held up as socially respectable, when if you know what they've really been up to, it's unfathomable that they would be considered socially respectable.
[02:28:10.451 --> 02:28:13.734]  And that's why it's so important you bust the fake news link.
[02:28:13.734 --> 02:28:18.037]  It absolutely can be changed and it absolutely can be stopped, but
[02:28:18.590 --> 02:28:31.653]  It means the rest of us are going to have to focus on what do we do to nurture and build a human civilization and it starts with understanding that we have a group of people who've got the bit in their mouth and they want an inhuman civilization.
[02:28:31.653 --> 02:28:40.294]  It's very hard for many successful particularly business people to understand that it really is that bad and that's part of what's got to be made clear.
[02:28:40.294 --> 02:28:43.675]  It really is that bad and now we have to create the alternatives.
[02:28:43.675 --> 02:28:47.996]  Believe it or not the alternatives are far more wealth creating than what these folks are up to.
[02:28:48.596 --> 02:28:52.601]  It's just more wealth creating for them to own all the wealth.
[02:28:52.601 --> 02:28:57.006]  So they would rather have a smaller pie that they control than a much bigger pie.
[02:28:57.006 --> 02:29:04.074]  And it's contingent on the rest of us to say, wait a minute, you know, there's a plan that includes all of us that has a much bigger pie.
[02:29:05.063 --> 02:29:14.466]  Let me read a quote by one of the bankers that got into the really, really seedy, dark areas of the psychopath's test that they give initiates into this gang.
[02:29:14.466 --> 02:29:20.228]  The people who do not underestimate the severity of this are but few.
[02:29:20.228 --> 02:29:27.671]  Because this is an annihilating force that hates our guts, it hates our creation, it hates life, and it will do anything
[02:29:28.715 --> 02:29:30.536]  To destroy us completely.
[02:29:30.536 --> 02:29:32.978]  And the way to do that is to divide humanity.
[02:29:32.978 --> 02:29:33.798]  Divide and conquer.
[02:29:33.798 --> 02:29:34.999]  Is there truth?
[02:29:34.999 --> 02:29:35.419]  He added.
[02:29:35.419 --> 02:29:37.260]  That's very, very profound.
[02:29:37.260 --> 02:29:40.702]  So there are very few people out there that actually estimate just how bad this is.
[02:29:40.702 --> 02:29:42.103]  I am one of them.
[02:29:42.103 --> 02:29:44.144]  Katherine's one of them because she's been on the inside.
[02:29:44.144 --> 02:29:47.406]  And we'll talk about these two different worldviews.
[02:29:47.406 --> 02:29:50.308]  Pro-death, pro-enslavement, pro-life.
[02:29:50.308 --> 02:29:52.930]  On the other side, InfoWars.com is our website.
[02:29:52.930 --> 02:29:54.070]  They're trying to censor it.
[02:29:54.070 --> 02:29:54.831]  Please spread the link.
[02:29:55.211 --> 02:29:56.615]  We're on the march.
[02:29:56.615 --> 02:29:59.222]  The empire of the 30 hour global transmission.
[02:29:59.222 --> 02:30:01.167]  Tell everybody to tune in.
[02:30:01.167 --> 02:30:02.812]  This is the forbidden truth.
[02:30:06.215 --> 02:30:08.336]  December 23rd, 1776.
[02:30:08.336 --> 02:30:11.679]  These are the times that try men's souls.
[02:30:11.679 --> 02:30:16.682]  The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country.
[02:30:16.682 --> 02:30:21.485]  But he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.
[02:30:21.485 --> 02:30:24.107]  Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered.
[02:30:24.107 --> 02:30:29.130]  Yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
[02:30:29.130 --> 02:30:32.152]  What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly.
[02:30:32.152 --> 02:30:34.794]  It is dearness only that gives everything its value.
[02:30:35.094 --> 02:30:43.818]  Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods, and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.
[02:30:43.818 --> 02:30:52.201]  Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right not only to tax, but to bind us in all cases whatsoever.
[02:30:52.201 --> 02:30:57.444]  And if being bound in that matter is not slavery, then there is no such thing as slavery upon Earth.
[02:30:57.444 --> 02:31:02.426]  Even the expression is impious, for so unlimited a power can only belong to God.
[02:31:03.306 --> 02:31:05.328]  Thomas Paine, The American Crisis.
[02:31:23.444 --> 02:31:28.086]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[02:31:28.086 --> 02:31:29.206]  I don't feel good.
[02:31:29.206 --> 02:31:32.967]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[02:31:32.967 --> 02:31:35.668]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[02:31:35.668 --> 02:31:41.451]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[02:31:41.451 --> 02:31:44.412]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[02:31:44.412 --> 02:31:47.953]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[02:31:47.953 --> 02:31:50.194]  So, obviously the Super Female is amazing.
[02:31:50.194 --> 02:31:50.554]  I love it.
[02:31:50.794 --> 02:31:53.517]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[02:31:53.517 --> 02:31:54.518]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:31:54.518 --> 02:32:00.205]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[02:32:00.205 --> 02:32:02.368]  It's got a five-star rating.
[02:32:02.368 --> 02:32:04.390]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[02:32:06.129 --> 02:32:11.514]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:32:11.514 --> 02:32:14.376]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[02:32:14.376 --> 02:32:16.358]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[02:32:16.358 --> 02:32:21.382]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[02:32:21.382 --> 02:32:23.484]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:32:23.484 --> 02:32:24.765]  In fact, it's certified.
[02:32:24.765 --> 02:32:29.890]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:32:29.890 --> 02:32:33.253]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[02:32:33.393 --> 02:32:36.754]  That your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:32:36.754 --> 02:32:39.755]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[02:32:39.755 --> 02:32:43.436]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:32:43.436 --> 02:32:50.338]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:32:50.338 --> 02:32:57.860]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.
[02:32:57.860 --> 02:33:00.721]  Learn more about InfoWars Life Super Blue Toothpaste.

[02:33:10.768 --> 02:33:14.330]  It's Wednesday, May 3rd, 2017.
[02:33:14.330 --> 02:33:24.557]  We are now initiating the launch of a 30-hour transmission in defense of the West in free speech, which are both under critical historic attack.
[02:33:24.557 --> 02:33:37.405]  If you simply go to InfoWars.com and spread the link, InfoWars.com forward slash show, and spread our live YouTube and Facebook feeds, as well as tell friends, family, and neighbors about the local AM and FM stations you're listening on,
[02:33:37.705 --> 02:33:52.913]  We will gain millions of new listeners today during this special global transmission of mass human awakening and the overthrow of the new world order technotronic hell-bent globalist technocracy.
[02:33:52.913 --> 02:33:58.015]  That's the little cut I did this morning before the live broadcast that we're now 2 hours 33 minutes and 55 seconds into.
[02:34:00.998 --> 02:34:04.841]  The media makes a joke and says I sound like a professional wrestler while my voice is shot.
[02:34:04.841 --> 02:34:09.305]  Professional wrestling is a facsimile of men upset fighting over something.
[02:34:09.305 --> 02:34:10.206]  That's the acting.
[02:34:10.206 --> 02:34:11.007]  This isn't an act.
[02:34:11.007 --> 02:34:17.792]  I have a shot larynx, blown out voice like a 75-year-old man, 75-year-old drill sergeant.
[02:34:17.792 --> 02:34:19.974]  But these are epic things that are happening.
[02:34:19.974 --> 02:34:23.037]  Le Pen and the Brexit and Trump.
[02:34:23.037 --> 02:34:28.722]  And even if those things don't go perfectly our way, it is a manifestation of people being upset about what's going on.
[02:34:29.798 --> 02:34:32.039]  I see it overall as very, very positive.
[02:34:32.039 --> 02:34:33.300]  And people are waking up.
[02:34:33.300 --> 02:34:38.503]  And the fact that the system scared a little old me shows really how pathetic they are.
[02:34:38.503 --> 02:34:53.091]  But once the people realize there's a private, global, corporate government that's above the law, tax-exempt, the diplomatic community, once they learn there's this breakaway system, in the elite's own words, then we can start a real debate about it.
[02:34:53.091 --> 02:34:55.232]  The movie that came closest to this would be Elysium.
[02:34:56.305 --> 02:34:59.227]  But then that kind of had a socialist view of how to fix it.
[02:34:59.227 --> 02:35:00.588]  And an open borders view.
[02:35:00.588 --> 02:35:05.711]  The globalists are imploding the third world, using the giant third world populations and then bring down the first world.
[02:35:05.711 --> 02:35:13.296]  Because the first world is already a breakaway civilization that the super breakaway civilization wants to get rid of as well.
[02:35:13.296 --> 02:35:21.962]  They want to go back to city-states, corporate city-states, totally new cities built in rural areas, if you read UN and globalist writings, where only the elite live.
[02:35:23.228 --> 02:35:27.113]  Under high security, this is the new system we're going into.
[02:35:27.113 --> 02:35:29.516]  The future's here, it's just not equally distributed.
[02:35:29.516 --> 02:35:31.159]  That's been said by many people in different ways.
[02:35:32.435 --> 02:35:36.016]  We're running some of the biggest specials of the year at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:35:36.016 --> 02:35:37.016]  They're trying to shut us down.
[02:35:37.016 --> 02:35:38.176]  They're going after our sponsors.
[02:35:38.176 --> 02:35:40.417]  A member of the New York Federal Reserve Board is suing me.
[02:35:40.417 --> 02:35:43.538]  I mean, they're coming after us.

[02:36:15.693 --> 02:36:20.177]  Let me read you a review of BrainForce by Lineman101 in 84 PA.
[02:36:23.544 --> 02:36:24.524]  They're telling you the truth.
[02:36:24.524 --> 02:36:26.305]  This supplement really is amazing.
[02:36:26.305 --> 02:36:29.245]  Giving me positive, high-focus attitude throughout the day.
[02:36:29.245 --> 02:36:34.346]  Excellent memory recall and smooth, consistent thought process to multitask different projects simultaneously.
[02:36:34.346 --> 02:36:41.168]  All of this without the crash you get, that's what we wanted to develop, with caffeine and without the next day fog with some other supplements.
[02:36:41.168 --> 02:36:45.489]  I have and will continue to recommend Rainforest Plus, everyone I know, now with 20% more in each bottle.
[02:36:48.075 --> 02:36:49.996]  So many other five-star reviews.
[02:36:49.996 --> 02:36:51.257]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:36:51.257 --> 02:36:57.562]  And when you fund us, it is a serious move towards their system being brought down.
[02:36:57.562 --> 02:37:12.192]  When you go to farmers markets, when you start a local truck farm, when you start a blacksmith shop, when you spend time with your family, when you create your own literature or art or your own music that is outside the corporate system, it brings them down.
[02:37:12.192 --> 02:37:13.453]  It's not about left or right, folks.
[02:37:13.453 --> 02:37:13.794]  It's about
[02:37:14.494 --> 02:37:16.436]  Building pro-human systems.
[02:37:16.436 --> 02:37:20.519]  And Katherine Austen-Fitz of Solari.com is an expert on that.
[02:37:20.519 --> 02:37:23.261]  Her amazing magazine is the Solari Report.
[02:37:23.261 --> 02:37:25.202]  You definitely want to get this.
[02:37:25.202 --> 02:37:26.303]  It's a beautiful magazine.
[02:37:26.303 --> 02:37:30.847]  You may think you know all of this, but you don't.
[02:37:30.847 --> 02:37:33.409]  And it's great to give as a gift to others.
[02:37:34.980 --> 02:37:37.862]  And she's got a new report card for them in the first 70 days.
[02:37:37.862 --> 02:37:42.566]  I thought it was pretty good in the first 70, but boy, after that, he really started turning sideways.
[02:37:42.566 --> 02:37:43.367]  Still doing some good.
[02:37:43.367 --> 02:37:47.531]  So in the 10 minutes we've got, Catherine, I really appreciate your time.
[02:37:47.531 --> 02:37:54.676]  I've been asking the questions, and you've already brought up some really thought-provoking, deep information.
[02:37:54.676 --> 02:37:55.817]  How's humanity doing?
[02:37:55.817 --> 02:37:57.479]  Are we doing better than we were five years ago?
[02:37:57.479 --> 02:37:58.580]  Are we doing worse?
[02:37:58.580 --> 02:38:00.902]  What are other big signposts we should look for?
[02:38:00.902 --> 02:38:02.303]  What else do you want to impart to people?
[02:38:04.275 --> 02:38:12.587]  We're doing much better than we were doing five years ago, because I think, especially after the bailouts, more and more people understand something significant has to change.
[02:38:12.587 --> 02:38:14.910]  So transparency is first.
[02:38:14.910 --> 02:38:17.073]  So you have to bring transparency to the problem.
[02:38:17.073 --> 02:38:18.555]  After that, you have to go to work on it.
[02:38:20.959 --> 02:38:32.566]  So I spend every four years really in a state of complete frustration because we keep spending countless hours focused on changing the members of the pro-centralization team in Washington.
[02:38:32.566 --> 02:38:33.707]  That's not going to do it.
[02:38:33.707 --> 02:38:36.968]  You've got to, you know, you've got to drain the swamp one county at a time.
[02:38:36.968 --> 02:38:40.070]  And as I said, the president can do a lot if you have an 80% consensus.
[02:38:41.917 --> 02:38:47.987]  My theory is you've got to turn the red button green, which is you've got to make money pushing the red button.
[02:38:47.987 --> 02:38:55.639]  Because in fact, if you get the local business people, the local banks, the local farmers in a room and start going through
[02:38:56.155 --> 02:39:01.860]  The federal budgets and financial statements for your county, just bring it down to a place-based basis.
[02:39:01.860 --> 02:39:19.175]  But if you go through all the federal money, sources and uses in your county, the credit, the programs, everything else, the local businesses, Alex, can make money and create lots of employment and new entrepreneurial opportunities by getting all that stuff back in a way that's going to help the budget.
[02:39:19.975 --> 02:39:33.559]  When I was at HUD, we used to see people building new HUD housing for $250,000 a unit, when $50,000 would buy and rehab a single-family home in the HUD foreclosed inventory in the same four-block area.
[02:39:33.559 --> 02:39:40.521]  I went to the person who ran that program and I said, look, we could have four or five homes for the price of one.
[02:39:40.521 --> 02:39:43.642]  And they said, but how would we generate fees for our friends?
[02:39:43.642 --> 02:39:46.223]  Now, you know, we're all dependent.
[02:39:46.744 --> 02:39:48.925]  Directly or indirectly on fees for our friends.
[02:39:48.925 --> 02:39:51.766]  And that's why it's so important in every community.
[02:39:51.766 --> 02:39:54.226]  They call it participatory budgeting.
[02:39:54.226 --> 02:40:05.050]  If you can get the business and banking and financial leadership in every community to start looking for opportunities to re-engineer the federal budget, I assure you the thousands of them.
[02:40:05.050 --> 02:40:07.810]  Why is Washington paying a defense contractor $150 an hour?
[02:40:09.851 --> 02:40:13.895]  For something that can be teleported into your community for $25 plus health care.
[02:40:13.895 --> 02:40:29.129]  So draining the swamp means transferring the power back to the people and back to the states but we have to actually be willing to do it and we'd actually get more of our money back and be more prosperous and you know he talked about that in his powerful January 20th State of the Union speech that I thought was pure Americana but then the problem is...
[02:40:30.632 --> 02:40:40.677]  So take all the Bernie Sanders supporters and all the Trump supporters in every county, the ones who want to play, and what you say is, okay, how do we make money draining the swamp?
[02:40:40.677 --> 02:40:52.363]  Because the way you make money draining the swamp is you take all those financial flows that are going to people who are not, you know, sort of on our team and getting them to flow back onto our team.
[02:40:52.363 --> 02:40:53.784]  So we're the honest local banks.
[02:40:54.807 --> 02:40:57.330]  We're the honest businesses who can do a good job.
[02:40:57.330 --> 02:41:03.397]  How do you get the whole contracting flow and the purchase flow and the business flow flowing back to them?
[02:41:03.397 --> 02:41:05.259]  So switch the money.
[02:41:05.259 --> 02:41:06.200]  That's how you do it.
[02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:07.321]  And it's very granular.
[02:41:07.321 --> 02:41:08.463]  You've got to do it bottom up.
[02:41:09.746 --> 02:41:20.869]  If you had a group of Bernie Sanders supporters and Trump supporters working together to plow into the money in every county in America, I assure you Trump would end up... No, I agree, but here's the problem.
[02:41:20.869 --> 02:41:27.650]  The Sanders supporters are right about a lot of corporate greed and corporations being above the law, but then they want socialism, or communism, a lot of them.
[02:41:27.650 --> 02:41:28.310]  Don't they get that?
[02:41:28.310 --> 02:41:30.751]  Look at Venezuela, look at Cuba, look at North Korea.
[02:41:30.751 --> 02:41:35.172]  How do we get them to understand that it is human empowerment and local control that works?
[02:41:35.172 --> 02:41:38.253]  I mean, as we know, communism only works locally as well.
[02:41:38.253 --> 02:41:38.833]  Nothing works
[02:41:39.153 --> 02:41:40.935]  Except local.
[02:41:40.935 --> 02:41:42.796]  You take it local, and here's how.
[02:41:42.796 --> 02:41:45.498]  And you talk money, you don't talk concept.
[02:41:45.498 --> 02:41:53.725]  So I used to be on a great listserv with a community organizer from Ohio, and he and I disagreed on everything.
[02:41:53.725 --> 02:41:58.769]  Whenever we talked ideology, we disagreed on everything, and the fights were bitter.
[02:41:58.769 --> 02:42:05.835]  Every time we talked about what we needed to do in a local neighborhood, and we had a budget, and we had the numbers, we agreed in 95% of the time.
[02:42:07.336 --> 02:42:12.420]  So ideology gets in the way of cold hard facts.
[02:42:12.420 --> 02:42:23.067]  Ideology is a complete divide and conquer tactic to divide people who all agree that the money should be used lawfully.
[02:42:23.067 --> 02:42:36.737]  If you can just agree that the laws of the Constitution and the laws of financial management should be applied to the federal government, then you will get 95% agreement between the Bernie Sanders people and the Donald Trump people
[02:42:37.718 --> 02:42:39.800]  And as long as you keep it local.
[02:42:39.800 --> 02:42:41.201]  And that's the positive view.
[02:42:41.201 --> 02:42:42.762]  Let's look at the globalist view.
[02:42:42.762 --> 02:42:52.552]  They admit they want a neo-feudal system where the people are set in a poor system, they use fake environmentalism to control us, ignore all the real environmental crises.
[02:42:53.112 --> 02:43:02.781]  They have all these UN Agenda 21's written by the big banks, and then we see big mega banks and the ultra-rich promoting communism, and Obama going to Latin America and saying communism's good.
[02:43:02.781 --> 02:43:13.592]  There he is in this whole capitalist system, this sick relationship between crony capitalism and any type of authoritarianism, fascism, oligarchies, communism.
[02:43:13.592 --> 02:43:14.432]  Do you agree with that?
[02:43:14.432 --> 02:43:18.116]  A, and then B, why is that relationship so pervasive?
[02:43:19.232 --> 02:43:23.468]  Right now we have a cycle of disrespect between the leadership and the people.
[02:43:24.344 --> 02:43:35.914]  And one of the reasons the leadership literally engineered a financial coup d'etat is because they couldn't figure out a way to build a constituency for financial responsibility and get the money run clean.
[02:43:35.914 --> 02:43:41.779]  So the United States was built on the principle... By the way, I was told that by the head of one of the biggest banks in the U.S.
[02:43:41.779 --> 02:43:44.221]  on a first-class, you know, flight on American Airlines.
[02:43:44.221 --> 02:43:47.944]  It was all off-record, so I can't say the guy's name, but he basically said, Alex, they're immoral.
[02:43:47.944 --> 02:43:48.965]  They don't want it.
[02:43:48.965 --> 02:43:50.586]  We've already tried it 50 years ago.
[02:43:50.586 --> 02:43:51.387]  We're taking over.
[02:43:53.098 --> 02:43:57.919]  You have a group of people who've had it proved to them again and again, it can't work.
[02:43:57.919 --> 02:44:03.461]  And yes, you absolutely have a group that's immoral, but you have plenty of other people.
[02:44:03.461 --> 02:44:05.401]  You can't run the system.
[02:44:05.401 --> 02:44:05.962]  They can't.
[02:44:05.962 --> 02:44:08.902]  The top guys can't run the system without the establishment.
[02:44:08.902 --> 02:44:13.784]  You have plenty of people in that establishment who would like to see it work, but they don't know how.
[02:44:13.784 --> 02:44:17.245]  And so I've spent a lifetime trying to work out the nuts and bolts.
[02:44:17.245 --> 02:44:18.265]  I know it can work.
[02:44:19.011 --> 02:44:27.278]  The question is, were the people... But as Thomas Jefferson said, if you have an immoral population, you can't have a free country.
[02:44:27.278 --> 02:44:28.139]  I disagree.
[02:44:28.139 --> 02:44:32.763]  You bring enough transparency to their immorality, and I assure you, they will be shunned.
[02:44:32.763 --> 02:44:38.647]  So, this is why transparency is at the very, very heart of what we have to do.
[02:44:38.647 --> 02:44:40.769]  And notice, we're more transparent than ever.
[02:44:40.769 --> 02:44:44.993]  Big corporations, government, the UN, they're absolutely opaque.
[02:44:47.148 --> 02:44:47.948]  Correct.
[02:44:47.948 --> 02:44:50.249]  But they're opaque because we let the money be opaque.
[02:44:50.249 --> 02:44:52.049]  And that's why I keep coming back.
[02:44:52.049 --> 02:44:52.749]  Follow the money.
[02:44:52.749 --> 02:44:54.730]  Don't worry about any of that.
[02:44:54.730 --> 02:44:59.011]  Worry about the money in your county, of every county and every person.
[02:44:59.011 --> 02:45:00.931]  So let me give you an example.
[02:45:00.931 --> 02:45:04.752]  Why is anybody banking at a New York Fed member bank?
[02:45:04.752 --> 02:45:07.073]  Why is any person in America banking?
[02:45:07.073 --> 02:45:15.335]  So if we're going to continue to support in the marketplace and support with our tax dollars and support people who do this,
[02:45:15.615 --> 02:45:21.241]  I mean, this really comes down to who are we going to admire, the lawful or the quote-unquote winner?
[02:45:23.851 --> 02:45:24.532]  Powerful.
[02:45:24.532 --> 02:45:27.234]  Katherine Austin Fitz, I just really admire your work.
[02:45:27.234 --> 02:45:31.517]  I also get your magazine and I watch your videos and then I go, hey, it's been two years since she's on.
[02:45:31.517 --> 02:45:34.139]  You know, life just starts going faster and faster.
[02:45:34.139 --> 02:45:34.940]  Please stay in contact.
[02:45:34.940 --> 02:45:38.242]  Please come on whenever you've got breaking news or you want to talk about a subject.
[02:45:38.242 --> 02:45:46.469]  You've got Nico's info and then Nico, we'll try to get her on every few months, but anytime you want on any of the shows here, any of the broadcasts, please come share your knowledge.
[02:45:46.469 --> 02:45:48.310]  Thank you so much.
[02:45:48.310 --> 02:45:49.952]  Just keep breaking through the ice, Alex.
[02:45:50.805 --> 02:45:54.749]  One last question, and I want your true answer on this.
[02:45:54.749 --> 02:46:00.494]  In your gut, do you think Trump really is a good guy and wanted to fix things?
[02:46:00.494 --> 02:46:08.741]  I think the more Trump worked on the campaign, the more he got interested in real solutions bottom up and saw the possibility.
[02:46:08.741 --> 02:46:17.169]  I think now that he's in the swamp trying to get things done, he realizes how dependent he is on the
[02:46:17.679 --> 02:46:17.999]  We're good
[02:46:37.907 --> 02:46:43.352]  Really a romantic type person and he really does want Americana in the 1950s 2.0.
[02:46:43.352 --> 02:46:44.453]  He does want wealth for everybody.
[02:46:44.453 --> 02:46:51.199]  He's one of the most unracist people out there from people I know behind the scenes that know him and he really wants to get rid of the big giant underclasses.
[02:46:51.199 --> 02:46:55.883]  He's a guy that's based on the service economy so he hates seeing people get poor.
[02:46:56.864 --> 02:46:59.425]  And the word is he's getting pretty demoralized.
[02:46:59.425 --> 02:47:01.786]  The first 70 days he tried to charge in.
[02:47:01.786 --> 02:47:03.247]  They called him a Russian agent.
[02:47:03.247 --> 02:47:04.688]  They tried to shut him down.
[02:47:04.688 --> 02:47:06.248]  All the agencies rebelled against him.
[02:47:06.248 --> 02:47:08.009]  So he started compromising.
[02:47:08.009 --> 02:47:11.091]  He's still trying to get the economy turned back on.
[02:47:11.091 --> 02:47:14.392]  But you can just see the swamp is draining him.
[02:47:14.392 --> 02:47:16.933]  Well, let's look at this in terms of math.
[02:47:19.611 --> 02:47:25.053]  If you look at the total wealth that we have on planet earth right now, it's 1% of what it could be.
[02:47:25.053 --> 02:47:31.816]  So Trump's a money guy and he understands the possibility to dramatically increase the total pie.
[02:47:31.816 --> 02:47:37.179]  What he's up against and starting to understand is the very top of the top don't want
[02:47:37.759 --> 02:47:39.300]  To optimize the total pie.
[02:47:39.300 --> 02:47:44.124]  They want to keep very tight control and continue to run things in secret.
[02:47:44.124 --> 02:47:45.785]  And that's what he's running into.
[02:47:45.785 --> 02:47:50.969]  And why he didn't quite understand that completely when he went in, I'm not sure.
[02:47:50.969 --> 02:47:51.309]  That's right.
[02:47:51.309 --> 02:47:55.192]  That's why you've got his chief of staff and all of them saying, look, we're dealing with a deep state.
[02:47:55.192 --> 02:47:55.972]  They're ignoring us.
[02:47:55.972 --> 02:47:57.753]  And the deep state's bragging about it.
[02:47:57.753 --> 02:47:58.554]  And it's so arrogant.
[02:47:58.554 --> 02:48:00.575]  It's out there trying to organize a violent coup.
[02:48:02.287 --> 02:48:08.531]  I think Trump can't believe that there are that many people willing to go along with something that is inhuman.
[02:48:08.531 --> 02:48:11.272]  That's, that's what he finds befuddling.
[02:48:11.272 --> 02:48:17.976]  Why are so many humans supporting something that will ultimately lead to their demise or their children's demise?
[02:48:17.976 --> 02:48:19.717]  That's what he's struggling to understand.
[02:48:19.717 --> 02:48:28.362]  And that's why you have to get into the whole issue, not only of fake news, but using entrainment and subliminal programming and other kinds of mind control techniques.
[02:48:28.502 --> 02:48:29.083]  Sure, that's it.
[02:48:29.083 --> 02:48:39.953]  I mean, he made a real run at them in the campaign in the first 70, and then he started giving up, and then Bannon got sidelined because they were going to overthrow him, and so I don't think he sold out.
[02:48:39.953 --> 02:48:46.799]  He just compromised and made a deal because he realizes how weak the people are, how weak Congress is, and you're right.
[02:48:46.799 --> 02:48:48.001]  We are all the swamp.
[02:48:48.001 --> 02:48:48.861]  It's an inside job.
[02:48:48.861 --> 02:48:50.203]  We've got to drain ourselves.
[02:48:50.203 --> 02:48:52.305]  Katherine Austin Fitch, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:48:53.840 --> 02:48:55.501]  Have a great day, Alex!
[02:49:24.346 --> 02:49:29.416]  But also, a lie goes halfway around the world before the truth puts his pants on, to quote Mark Twain.
[02:49:29.416 --> 02:49:31.219]  So, this is quite a time to be alive.
[02:49:31.219 --> 02:49:32.341]  Mike Cernovich is coming up.
[02:49:32.341 --> 02:49:34.766]  I want to spend a few minutes with him, because I'm a fan of Mike Cernovich.
[02:49:36.118 --> 02:49:37.919]  And then, of course, I want to take calls.
[02:49:37.919 --> 02:49:40.241]  I'm the worst about it with all these guests not taking calls.
[02:49:40.241 --> 02:49:44.263]  The calls are amazing, especially when I take a lot of them, and the good callers call in.
[02:49:44.263 --> 02:49:44.323]  800-259-9231.
[02:49:44.323 --> 02:49:44.824]  800-259-9231.
[02:49:44.824 --> 02:49:47.765]  I want you to call in.
[02:49:47.765 --> 02:49:51.608]  We're going to have different numbers in different studios.
[02:49:51.608 --> 02:49:53.049]  That's the network number.
[02:49:53.049 --> 02:49:54.590]  We've got the number out of the radio studio.
[02:49:54.590 --> 02:49:55.871]  We've got four studios.
[02:49:56.471 --> 02:50:05.334]  So, we're going to have different numbers throughout the day in different studios, but I want every host that hosts to take at least 15-20 minutes of calls, bam, bam, bam, today.
[02:50:05.334 --> 02:50:08.155]  So, that's right through tomorrow with a 30-hour broadcast.

[02:50:30.276 --> 02:50:35.239]  I've been plugging a couple times an hour now because we've got to make it through the censorship, through getting our funding cut.
[02:50:36.223 --> 02:50:41.985]  Through the Federal Reserve Board of New York's lawsuit, by the Jordan Soros law firm that's hitting us.
[02:50:41.985 --> 02:50:43.865]  We don't have Nazi collaborator money like Soros.

[02:51:04.251 --> 02:51:05.912]  I want to expand, not just hold my ground.

[02:53:05.374 --> 02:53:07.334]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:53:07.334 --> 02:53:14.236]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:53:14.236 --> 02:53:22.578]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[02:53:28.659 --> 02:53:30.260]  My blood pressure has normalized.

[02:53:32.542 --> 02:53:36.946]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:53:36.946 --> 02:53:39.127]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[02:54:22.337 --> 02:54:25.219]  We're good.
[02:54:42.156 --> 02:54:48.261]  Mike Cernovich is going to be hosting for two hours, and myself, Lee Ann McAdoo, and more coming up in the 30-hour global transmission.
[02:54:48.261 --> 02:54:49.782]  Some stations carry the fourth hour.
[02:54:49.782 --> 02:54:55.327]  Obviously, most stations don't carry the 30-hour transmission, when once a month, every few months, we do an extended transmission.
[02:54:55.327 --> 02:55:03.194]  But stations are very welcome to pick up our internet feeds, satellite feeds, you name it, for any of the news that's coming up, and a lot of the big guests.
[02:55:03.194 --> 02:55:05.396]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:55:06.789 --> 02:55:11.690]  Please, in your email, your Facebook, your Twitter, everywhere, of its exponential, say, this is the forbidden information.
[02:55:11.690 --> 02:55:15.711]  This is the guy being sued by George Soros' law firm that he founded.
[02:55:15.711 --> 02:55:19.432]  This is the guy being sued by the New York Federal Reserve that actually runs the country.
[02:55:19.432 --> 02:55:22.273]  That's who actually runs it.
[02:55:22.273 --> 02:55:24.073]  A lot of breaking news at Infowars.com.
[02:55:24.073 --> 02:55:27.294]  Report, Kushner hid ties to George Soros.
[02:55:27.294 --> 02:55:29.795]  Obamacare repeal gains votes and momentum.
[02:55:30.677 --> 02:55:33.678]  A lot of news I'm going to be getting to with Cernovich.
[02:55:33.678 --> 02:55:37.180]  And I want to go to your calls, Uncle Sam and Shane and Nathan, but I got to play this clip.
[02:55:37.180 --> 02:55:40.902]  It's from The Onion, who is more real news than CNN.
[02:55:40.902 --> 02:55:45.244]  And you see on CNN and all these shows, you know, disgruntled Trump supporters.
[02:55:45.244 --> 02:55:46.745]  Trump's having the swamp drain him.
[02:55:46.745 --> 02:55:49.426]  He's done devastating stuff to the globals.
[02:55:49.426 --> 02:55:50.027]  He's a good guy.
[02:55:50.027 --> 02:55:53.949]  You just heard Fitz, who's been known as a pretty famous liberal overall, saying, no, he's for real.
[02:55:53.949 --> 02:55:54.829]  They're coming after him.
[02:55:54.829 --> 02:55:56.030]  It's real.
[02:55:56.030 --> 02:55:57.870]  And we're not backing him enough.
[02:55:57.870 --> 02:55:58.571]  And he's surrounded.
[02:55:59.963 --> 02:56:01.704]  And we are the swamp, not just Trump.
[02:56:01.704 --> 02:56:02.945]  We are the swamp.
[02:56:02.945 --> 02:56:04.246]  I said it, we are the world.
[02:56:04.246 --> 02:56:04.966]  That's a good point.
[02:56:04.966 --> 02:56:07.588]  We are the swamp.
[02:56:07.588 --> 02:56:09.609]  So let's go ahead and play this piece from The Onion.
[02:56:09.609 --> 02:56:10.630]  It's pretty funny.
[02:56:10.630 --> 02:56:13.972]  If you're a radio listener, the video's on Infowars.com.
[02:56:13.972 --> 02:56:16.034]  This is titled, Ronald Trump Supporter.
[02:56:16.034 --> 02:56:17.695]  Here it is.
[02:56:17.695 --> 02:56:19.796]  I voted for Donald Trump.
[02:56:19.796 --> 02:56:23.919]  I voted for Trump because I thought he'd create a better America for everyone.
[02:56:23.919 --> 02:56:29.623]  But after reading 800 or so pages on queer feminist theory, I realize now just how much I've been duped.
[02:56:32.111 --> 02:56:36.314]  You gotta understand, I come from a small steel town in Pennsylvania.
[02:56:36.314 --> 02:56:42.377]  If I had known the foundational texts on intersexual theory, I would have never chanted, Lock her up!
[02:56:42.377 --> 02:56:43.578]  Lock her up!
[02:56:43.578 --> 02:56:44.779]  Lock her up!
[02:56:44.779 --> 02:56:45.179]  Lock her up!
[02:56:46.610 --> 02:57:06.025]  We were told Hillary Clinton was the enemy, but it's clear now that the true enemy is a patriarchal, capitalistic society that maintains its ascendance by making powerful and ambitious women appear threatening, only to protect my status in a system purposefully designed to benefit cissette white men like myself.
[02:57:06.025 --> 02:57:06.466]  Jesus.
[02:57:09.477 --> 02:57:32.290]  When Donald Trump said he would make America great again, it's obvious to me now that he was only trying to play off my own complicity and comfort in an unequal social structure that disproportionately strips women and minorities, particularly trans and genderqueer people of color, of their autonomy and seeks to subjugate them to an invertebrate and intentionally antagonistic andocratic order.
[02:57:32.290 --> 02:57:37.593]  I get that now after I attended a gender-fluid non-binary poetry slam at Swarthmore.
[02:57:37.953 --> 02:57:40.236]  A couple of other guys from work attended it, too.
[02:57:40.236 --> 02:57:42.578]  And now it's all we talk about on the line.
[02:57:42.578 --> 02:57:45.442]  I like Trump because I thought he tells it like it is.
[02:57:45.442 --> 02:57:48.345]  But you know who really tells it like it is?
[02:57:48.345 --> 02:57:49.446]  Judith Butler.
[02:57:49.446 --> 02:57:52.550]  Gender is not to culture as sex is to nature.
[02:57:52.870 --> 02:58:04.361]  Gender is also the discursive cultural means by which sex nature or a natural sex is produced and established as pre-decursive prior to culture.
[02:58:04.361 --> 02:58:08.846]  A politically neutral surface on which culture acts.
[02:58:08.846 --> 02:58:13.610]  If I had just known that back in November, I would have never voted for Trump.
[02:58:13.610 --> 02:58:16.393]  God, how could I have been so stupid?
[02:58:17.654 --> 02:58:21.455]  That's right, gender is an oppressive system, not part of the species.
[02:58:21.455 --> 02:58:29.417]  I gotta hand it to ya, you know the globalists are in trouble when even the leftist foaming at the mouth onion is evacuating the sinking ship.
[02:58:29.417 --> 02:58:38.298]  No, Trump has devastated the New World Order, we have devastated the New World Order, nationalism has devastated it, as Catherine Austen Fitz said, we're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:58:38.298 --> 02:58:45.440]  Mike Cernovich, your phone calls, Leanne McAdoo and a slew of amazing special guests straight ahead in the 30 hour transmission

[02:59:58.134 --> 03:00:00.715]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:17.142 --> 03:00:22.809]  He aligns himself with the truth, but it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:00:22.809 --> 03:00:25.132]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:00:33.835 --> 03:00:35.696]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[03:00:35.696 --> 03:00:37.296]  I'm going to host another 30 minutes with Mike Cernovich.
[03:00:37.296 --> 03:00:41.198]  He's going to host another hour and a half with Leanne McAdoo and other investigative journalists.
[03:00:41.198 --> 03:00:43.019]  Mike Cernovich just last week on this broadcast.
[03:00:43.019 --> 03:00:45.540]  We played it earlier in the week, but we may play it later.
[03:00:45.540 --> 03:00:47.781]  It's on my Twitter account, Real Alex Jones.
[03:00:47.781 --> 03:00:48.462]  We want to go find it.
[03:00:49.162 --> 03:00:54.006]  Said that, hey, they had a meeting today, they're going to increase the boots on the ground and the funding in Afghanistan.
[03:00:54.006 --> 03:00:55.127]  It came out Monday.
[03:00:55.127 --> 03:00:55.888]  Bloomberg.
[03:00:55.888 --> 03:01:06.657]  Of course, we, two months ago, reported that there's lawsuits have confirmed $300 billion of stolen money out of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Mnuchin admitted that two days ago on Fox Business.
[03:01:06.657 --> 03:01:07.979]  So that's another Infowars story.
[03:01:07.979 --> 03:01:09.560]  That's why they hate us.
[03:01:09.560 --> 03:01:12.122]  Now, there's the video, if folks want to look for it.
[03:01:12.122 --> 03:01:13.784]  It's, it's, oh, we have the clip now?
[03:01:15.785 --> 03:01:23.946]  Okay, here is Cernovich, minutes after the meeting was over, breaking what came out three days later, and of course he gets no credit.
[03:01:23.946 --> 03:01:24.227]  Here it is.
[03:01:25.509 --> 03:01:27.490]  So it really is mind-blowing.
[03:01:27.490 --> 03:01:39.815]  So McMaster presented a $35 billion plan for Afghanistan at a principals meeting, which was with the whole National Security Council minus the president was there.
[03:01:39.815 --> 03:01:48.979]  McMaster wants to spend $35 billion in Afghanistan, and he faced a lot of resistance and pushback from various officials there.
[03:01:48.979 --> 03:01:51.721]  McMaster said, I quote, we will create
[03:01:52.521 --> 03:01:55.144]  An inclusive government.
[03:01:55.144 --> 03:02:02.871]  This strategy has not been presented to the President because even the people at the principals meeting think McMaster is out of his mind.
[03:02:02.871 --> 03:02:04.212]  They're saying, what are you talking about?
[03:02:04.212 --> 03:02:06.854]  You want to do $35 billion in Afghanistan?
[03:02:06.854 --> 03:02:07.975]  What is that going to look like?
[03:02:07.975 --> 03:02:10.638]  Are we talking troop surges, another surge?
[03:02:10.638 --> 03:02:14.782]  Now remember McMaster was a protege of David Petraeus and Petraeus is indeed
[03:02:15.522 --> 03:02:21.126]  Pulling the strings of McMaster and Petraeus was a big proponent of the search.
[03:02:21.126 --> 03:02:32.613]  So McMaster is now going to present another massive $35 billion plan to Donald Trump to create a new regime in Afghanistan.
[03:02:32.613 --> 03:02:36.335]  I just noticed Paul, just in his mannerisms, he's a handsome guy.
[03:02:36.335 --> 03:02:39.818]  Looks like a... One of the mammals that are
[03:02:42.501 --> 03:02:44.522]  Amphibians part of the time.
[03:02:44.522 --> 03:02:45.803]  Otters!
[03:02:45.803 --> 03:02:49.185]  Paul looks like an otter with his head sticking out of the water there.
[03:02:49.185 --> 03:02:51.547]  But seriously, I forget the name of the Bloomberg article that was everywhere.
[03:02:51.547 --> 03:02:58.731]  Bloomberg broke it Monday that McMaster wants to increase troops at least 23 billion, maybe 35 billion, just like Cernovich said.
[03:02:58.731 --> 03:03:01.493]  So again, no credit to Cernovich.
[03:03:01.493 --> 03:03:03.354]  Trump said no troops in Syria.
[03:03:03.354 --> 03:03:04.855]  His aides aren't so sure.
[03:03:04.855 --> 03:03:07.216]  No, no, that was when he was right about that weeks ago.
[03:03:07.216 --> 03:03:10.699]  There was another one on Monday, and that's not it, about McMaster.
[03:03:11.579 --> 03:03:17.544]  Wanting to expand troops in Afghanistan, not Syria, and how McMaster won the debate.
[03:03:17.544 --> 03:03:19.466]  And this isn't about tooting our horns here.
[03:03:19.466 --> 03:03:21.608]  It's that every day we're breaking big news.
[03:03:21.608 --> 03:03:23.810]  Here, he'll put it on screen for us as soon as it loads.
[03:03:23.810 --> 03:03:25.051]  We'll get it that way.
[03:03:25.051 --> 03:03:31.156]  But the point is, they cannot stand the fact that we're expanding this and that we're exposing them.
[03:03:31.156 --> 03:03:32.778]  Making Afghanistan great again.
[03:03:32.778 --> 03:03:34.319]  That's the name of the Bloomberg article.
[03:03:34.319 --> 03:03:35.961]  Three days after Sernovich broke it.
[03:03:35.961 --> 03:03:38.363]  So Mike, I mean, I tell you, that's why they want to shut us down, my friend.
[03:03:40.035 --> 03:03:40.996]  Yeah, it was so funny.
[03:03:40.996 --> 03:03:46.804]  I actually, I broke that on your show with Paul LeGray, as we now call him.
[03:03:46.804 --> 03:03:53.212]  And, you know, we're not going to get any credit for it, but the readers know, the listeners know, McMaster, he's just not a control man.
[03:03:53.212 --> 03:03:55.335]  So the latest story about McMaster,
[03:03:57.479 --> 03:04:06.001]  Trump has had enough of him and wants him to get a four-star general position and get him back to be the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army.
[03:04:06.001 --> 03:04:17.524]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, this is so big I want to come back and give you the floor after the break because I know you've got those White House sources and you've got them even better than I do or even people like Roger Stone does.
[03:04:17.524 --> 03:04:21.645]  So when we come back I want to give you the floor to lay this out but when did you get this news?
[03:04:22.836 --> 03:04:24.437]  Oh, just recently, yeah.
[03:04:24.437 --> 03:04:25.677]  Back when I was in D.C.
[03:04:25.677 --> 03:04:27.558]  So are you breaking this right now here?
[03:04:27.558 --> 03:04:28.979]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:04:28.979 --> 03:04:32.241]  Wow, and again, you've got Danger in play, but also you've got your new site.
[03:04:32.241 --> 03:04:33.922]  Tell folks about that.
[03:04:33.922 --> 03:04:36.863]  Yeah, so I've been doing a lot of blogging at Medium.com.
[03:04:36.863 --> 03:04:40.465]  That's where I only do the hard-hitting journalism.
[03:04:40.465 --> 03:04:49.950]  I used to write a lot about lifestyle, mindset, other areas of life, but the real journalism, yeah, we'll talk about a lot of big developments with McMaster, and, you know, after the break, we can talk about that.
[03:04:50.510 --> 03:04:51.251]  It's amazing.
[03:04:51.251 --> 03:04:55.816]  Mike Cernovich is, right now, the hottest investigative journalist in the world.
[03:04:55.816 --> 03:04:58.298]  I mean, forget Glenn Greenwald.
[03:04:58.298 --> 03:05:00.321]  We're not in competition.
[03:05:00.321 --> 03:05:02.543]  It's just that you gotta recognize what's happening here.
[03:05:02.543 --> 03:05:04.245]  He's about to be hosting for two hours.
[03:05:06.152 --> 03:05:11.016]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com with some patriotic quotes by Ron Paul.
[03:05:11.016 --> 03:05:19.743]  The most basic principle to being a free American is the notion that we as individuals are responsible for our own lives and decisions.
[03:05:19.743 --> 03:05:23.967]  We do not have the right to rob our neighbors to make up for our own mistakes.
[03:05:24.167 --> 03:05:30.411]  Neither does our neighbor have any right to tell us how to live, so long as we aren't infringing on their rights.
[03:05:30.411 --> 03:05:34.953]  Freedom to make bad decisions is inherent in the freedom to make good ones.
[03:05:34.953 --> 03:05:38.976]  If we are only free to make good decisions, then we are not really free.
[03:05:38.976 --> 03:05:46.060]  Liberty is lost through complacency and a subservient mindset when we accept or even welcome automobile checkpoints.
[03:05:46.280 --> 03:05:52.406]  Random searches, mandatory identification cards, and paramilitary police in our streets.
[03:05:52.406 --> 03:05:55.529]  We have lost a vital part of our American heritage.
[03:05:55.529 --> 03:06:00.153]  America was born of protests, revolution, and mistrust of government.
[03:06:00.153 --> 03:06:04.177]  Subservient societies neither maintain nor deserve freedom for long.
[03:06:06.058 --> 03:06:07.879]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[03:06:07.879 --> 03:06:14.481]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[03:06:14.481 --> 03:06:17.642]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslives.com.
[03:06:17.642 --> 03:06:27.426]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great-tasting formula.
[03:06:27.426 --> 03:06:28.266]  Caveman.
[03:06:28.266 --> 03:06:33.348]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[03:06:33.348 --> 03:06:35.449]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[03:06:35.749 --> 03:06:38.911]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[03:06:38.911 --> 03:06:44.055]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[03:06:44.055 --> 03:06:52.081]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[03:06:52.081 --> 03:07:00.046]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[03:07:00.046 --> 03:07:04.790]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself in 4WordsLime.com today.
[03:07:05.570 --> 03:07:09.552]  A new shipment of Bio-True Selenium is now available at Infowarslife.com.
[03:07:09.552 --> 03:07:11.033]  We've been sold out for months.
[03:07:11.033 --> 03:07:16.095]  Our one-of-a-kind Infowarslife Bio-True Selenium formula is now back in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[03:07:16.095 --> 03:07:20.237]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[03:07:20.237 --> 03:07:24.779]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium.
[03:07:24.779 --> 03:07:29.922]  But Bio-True Selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[03:07:29.922 --> 03:07:32.383]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium
[03:07:32.543 --> 03:07:32.703]  I think?
[03:07:52.142 --> 03:07:52.603]  We're good.
[03:08:09.083 --> 03:08:10.504]  We are the resistance.
[03:08:10.504 --> 03:08:14.927]  We stand against globalism and worldwide unelected corporate tyranny.
[03:08:14.927 --> 03:08:17.369]  We stand for free market capitalism.
[03:08:17.369 --> 03:08:19.150]  We stand for religious freedom.
[03:08:19.150 --> 03:08:20.751]  We stand for sovereignty.
[03:08:20.751 --> 03:08:22.152]  We stand for the family.
[03:08:22.152 --> 03:08:24.614]  We stand for the individual right to self-defense.
[03:08:24.614 --> 03:08:30.998]  We stand in defense of the Renaissance and the West as it is under massive globalist sustained siege.
[03:08:30.998 --> 03:08:32.279]  We are the Infowar.
[03:08:37.159 --> 03:08:39.741]  Can you keep him in the dark for life?
[03:08:39.741 --> 03:08:47.547]  Can you hide him from the way that world?
[03:08:47.547 --> 03:08:49.588]  Oh, Mother!
[03:08:49.588 --> 03:08:52.670]  Father!
[03:08:52.670 --> 03:08:56.133]  Gonna take your daughter out tonight.
[03:08:56.133 --> 03:08:59.055]  Gonna show her my world!
[03:08:59.055 --> 03:09:01.177]  Yeah, Father!
[03:09:02.381 --> 03:09:03.562]  Yeah!
[03:09:03.562 --> 03:09:05.903]  You wanna bang heads with me?
[03:09:05.903 --> 03:09:07.684]  I can show you what it's like!
[03:09:07.684 --> 03:09:16.148]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, getting fired up as we kick off the fourth hour of worldwide broadcast.
[03:09:19.025 --> 03:09:34.471]  Mike Cernovich, who in the last, he's been around years, doing a great job, I saw his work four or five years ago, just on culture, thought it was excellent, but the last year or so has just exploded in the investigative journalism, the energy, his sources, the guy works 18 hours a day because he loves it.
[03:09:34.471 --> 03:09:41.153]  I mean, he's like I am, but even more, he enjoys the work, he enjoys getting it done, he enjoys winning.
[03:09:41.153 --> 03:09:44.935]  And it's that spirit, it's just absolutely infectious.
[03:09:46.069 --> 03:09:48.774]  And Mike Cernovich has big breaking news.
[03:09:48.774 --> 03:09:49.436]  He just broke...
[03:09:50.336 --> 03:09:56.140]  Three weeks ago, that McMasters did want troops on the ground, and had brought in the Marines and the howitzers.
[03:09:56.140 --> 03:10:02.164]  I talked to my high-level CIA and Defense Department sources, and they said, absolutely, he wants 150,000 troops on the ground.
[03:10:02.164 --> 03:10:02.705]  Their word was 120,000.
[03:10:02.705 --> 03:10:04.746]  It's very much from the White House, 150.
[03:10:04.746 --> 03:10:09.029]  And that they're deceiving Trump, and he is getting pissed.
[03:10:09.029 --> 03:10:12.571]  Then, I talked to somebody very close to Trump a few days later.
[03:10:12.571 --> 03:10:13.512]  Let me just leave it at that.
[03:10:13.512 --> 03:10:16.294]  Last time I talked to that person very close to Trump.
[03:10:16.294 --> 03:10:17.295]  Can't really get much closer.
[03:10:18.035 --> 03:10:20.018]  And it was, don't worry about it.
[03:10:20.018 --> 03:10:21.660]  That's just to be strong in front of the Russians.
[03:10:21.660 --> 03:10:23.283]  We're not going in there on the ground.
[03:10:23.283 --> 03:10:25.245]  We're only there on the ground to take out ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[03:10:25.245 --> 03:10:27.929]  And this is, you know, obviously looks strong for China.
[03:10:29.108 --> 03:10:32.450]  And boom, Trump came out three days later and said exactly that.
[03:10:32.450 --> 03:10:35.672]  Came out that Cernovich was right about McMaster wanting all the troops.
[03:10:35.672 --> 03:10:48.260]  Then he came out Friday, as the meeting had just happened, McMaster wanted 20 to 35 billion more, a year going in, more troops, and Trump is really getting tired of it right now.
[03:10:48.260 --> 03:10:51.762]  So the word is, he wants to start moving him out of that position.
[03:10:51.762 --> 03:10:55.104]  Now, I want Mike Cernovich to lay this out for you from his sources.
[03:10:55.104 --> 03:10:55.685]  This is big.
[03:10:57.014 --> 03:10:57.874]  Right, exactly.
[03:10:57.874 --> 03:11:00.515]  So, a little bit of backstory.
[03:11:00.515 --> 03:11:10.857]  As you know, there's been a lot of personnel shifts within the White House, and there was never really... The Kushner-Bannon drama was overstated by the media.
[03:11:10.857 --> 03:11:14.418]  That was actually fed by Petraeus and McMaster.
[03:11:14.418 --> 03:11:20.839]  The real fight has always been between McMaster and Bannon, because McMaster, he's an interventionist.
[03:11:20.839 --> 03:11:22.620]  In fact, I talk to somebody and I go,
[03:11:23.925 --> 03:11:25.427]  I said, is McMaster evil?
[03:11:25.427 --> 03:11:27.530]  And they go, no, no, no, you don't understand, Sternovich.
[03:11:27.530 --> 03:11:29.833]  He's actually not an evil guy.
[03:11:29.833 --> 03:11:31.955]  He is truly an interventionist.
[03:11:31.955 --> 03:11:32.957]  It's like a religion to him.
[03:11:32.957 --> 03:11:34.639]  It's like a cult.
[03:11:34.639 --> 03:11:40.546]  He thinks that we can go in, and if we just bomb enough people and send enough... He thinks it's a dereliction of duty if you don't go in.
[03:11:41.306 --> 03:11:42.127]  Exactly.
[03:11:42.127 --> 03:11:46.049]  So I'm not saying McMaster, he's a great general.
[03:11:46.049 --> 03:11:47.771]  I'm not here to attack him.
[03:11:47.771 --> 03:11:51.473]  Very well spoken, great tactician, successful in battles.
[03:11:51.473 --> 03:11:52.014]  Exactly.
[03:11:52.014 --> 03:11:53.595]  So I'm not here to attack his character.
[03:11:53.595 --> 03:11:59.519]  I think that he's a good man who has a poisonous ideology and he's a legitimate true believer.
[03:11:59.519 --> 03:12:01.100]  It's like religion.
[03:12:01.100 --> 03:12:07.024]  So Trump wants to get him out because McMaster did another thing recently which nobody knows about.
[03:12:07.024 --> 03:12:08.546]  So I can break two stories right now.
[03:12:09.389 --> 03:12:17.795]  McMaster wanted to bring in Major General Ricky Weidel to be the Deputy National Security Advisor.
[03:12:17.795 --> 03:12:18.996]  Nobody knows this.
[03:12:18.996 --> 03:12:23.900]  So rather than get Trump's permission or talk to Rents or anything, they just gave him an office.
[03:12:24.600 --> 03:12:27.582]  They just gave him an office and said, OK, he's going to do it.
[03:12:27.582 --> 03:12:28.862]  Nobody else has this story.
[03:12:28.862 --> 03:12:32.504]  This hasn't been confirmed yet by anybody because they don't know.
[03:12:32.504 --> 03:12:35.606]  Their sources aren't any good, but this will eventually get around.
[03:12:35.606 --> 03:12:40.229]  So Trump is furious because, as you know, Trump is very much like you.
[03:12:40.229 --> 03:12:41.509]  I'm the boss.
[03:12:41.509 --> 03:12:43.330]  You know, you need to clear things by the boss.
[03:12:43.330 --> 03:12:44.531]  I'll give you a lot of freedom.
[03:12:44.531 --> 03:12:48.893]  But hey, before you hire somebody at that level, maybe you should tell me.
[03:12:48.893 --> 03:12:50.814]  And instead, McMaster just moved him in.
[03:12:50.814 --> 03:12:53.476]  McMaster, I've heard from other sources who know him.
[03:12:54.369 --> 03:12:56.832]  McMaster wants out of the job too.
[03:12:56.832 --> 03:13:03.562]  So what he's doing, he's deliberately antagonizing Trump to make Trump angry, to force Trump's hand.
[03:13:03.562 --> 03:13:06.505]  So Trump being the great tactician that he is.
[03:13:07.901 --> 03:13:21.910]  Trump has talked to the Pentagon, and what they're going to do is they want to give General McMaster his fourth star, pin him that final star, which if you're in the Army, that means way more to you than ever being National Security Advisor.
[03:13:21.910 --> 03:13:24.952]  And then they're going to move him to the Vice Chief of Staff position.
[03:13:24.952 --> 03:13:26.473]  So this is breaking news.
[03:13:26.473 --> 03:13:32.777]  Nobody's confirmed it yet, of course, because, you know, they're always a few days behind, behind Infowars, behind Cernovich, behind Alex Jones.
[03:13:33.878 --> 03:13:43.005]  And so that's what they're doing is they're trying to get, they're trying to have him replace the current Army's Vice Chief of Staff, whose tenure is about up anyway, so you wouldn't have to get rid of the guy.
[03:13:43.005 --> 03:13:46.208]  And then that would be how you're going to get McMaster out of there.
[03:13:46.208 --> 03:13:47.489]  And it's a promotion for him.
[03:13:47.489 --> 03:13:49.871]  So McMaster will be happy.
[03:13:50.231 --> 03:13:55.555]  The media can't really turn this into some big drama about chaos and confusion.
[03:13:55.555 --> 03:13:59.017]  So the media will just say, oh, congratulations, McMaster got the four star here.
[03:13:59.017 --> 03:14:00.278]  And then Trump can give a speech.
[03:14:00.278 --> 03:14:01.819]  Congratulations, General.
[03:14:01.819 --> 03:14:02.639]  Everybody's happy.
[03:14:02.639 --> 03:14:03.620]  It's a win-win.
[03:14:03.620 --> 03:14:07.843]  And then that is how McMaster gets moved out of the position of National Security Advisor.
[03:14:09.500 --> 03:14:10.580]  You know, it's crazy.
[03:14:10.580 --> 03:14:16.943]  Separate from learning this from you, I had Steve Pachinik on who was the head of PsyOps for the CIA.
[03:14:16.943 --> 03:14:25.025]  It's not the State Department and co-wrote Clancy's books and founded Delta Force, but he has his big sources, let's just say, up above him.
[03:14:25.025 --> 03:14:26.446]  And people that are currently in
[03:14:27.526 --> 03:14:42.898]  And he said this on air the other day and also privately related through that, you know, it's McMaster and people that flip the switch on you three weeks ago at national security to have the media go after you and all the rest of it, because at that level, you know, they've got control.
[03:14:42.898 --> 03:14:49.202]  They green lighted that, that they're even trying to basically burn some of Trump's ardent supporters.
[03:14:50.228 --> 03:14:55.430]  Not that they even think we're bad, but just they think of us as like a competing power group, and they just want us discredited.
[03:14:55.430 --> 03:15:04.813]  Not dead, not in prison, but discredited so the Democrats and Soros and all them are kind of in a perfect storm going along these lines.
[03:15:04.813 --> 03:15:07.754]  And just that I should be aware of that, that that's why things have been so bad.
[03:15:07.754 --> 03:15:12.996]  Do you have any intel, not on me specifically, but just on some of the groups that McMaster's working with?
[03:15:13.976 --> 03:15:17.519]  Yeah, it's actually Petraeus and the Saudis behind all of this.
[03:15:17.519 --> 03:15:26.665]  Oh, by the way, I got a call from a New York Times writer, another big writer, and I was told over the weekend, stop talking about the Saudis and the Muslims, or you're going to be destroyed.
[03:15:26.665 --> 03:15:29.667]  And I said, this is my second call, took the second call until I got it.
[03:15:29.667 --> 03:15:31.008]  I said, is this a threat?
[03:15:31.008 --> 03:15:31.809]  Will I be destroyed?
[03:15:31.809 --> 03:15:34.251]  And they said, you've got to stop now.
[03:15:34.251 --> 03:15:39.074]  It was drop the stuff on Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, by the way, and drop that Muslims are bad.
[03:15:39.074 --> 03:15:40.495]  They're good people, Alex.
[03:15:40.495 --> 03:15:41.136]  Just stop.
[03:15:41.696 --> 03:15:48.178]  And I'm being sued by the New York Fed board member who owns the yogurt thing with all this made-up stuff.
[03:15:48.178 --> 03:15:49.319]  I mean, they are really pissed.
[03:15:49.319 --> 03:15:50.599]  Go ahead.
[03:15:50.599 --> 03:16:00.823]  Well, I was actually told by some of the same kinds of people who have been sources to me, and they go, I just want to let you know that you can never be alone now for at least the next year, year and a half.
[03:16:00.823 --> 03:16:01.463]  And I go, what do you mean?
[03:16:01.463 --> 03:16:03.164]  And he said, anybody can be roofied.
[03:16:03.769 --> 03:16:05.490]  And I go, whoa, what are you talking about, man?
[03:16:05.490 --> 03:16:07.191]  He goes, look, you don't have any idea.
[03:16:07.191 --> 03:16:11.433]  He goes, you thought you were just going to come in swinging and it was no big deal.
[03:16:11.433 --> 03:16:15.195]  He goes, you're not dealing with Twitter people, you're dealing with Patrice, you're dealing with Bessaris.
[03:16:15.195 --> 03:16:25.980]  He goes, I'll just tell you right now, you better never be alone where you can't be accounted for, because you will wake up in a room and they will frame you for things they said you have no idea what kind of forces are against you right now.
[03:16:27.295 --> 03:16:27.936]  Well, that's right.
[03:16:27.936 --> 03:16:37.624]  In fact, that's the word is, they will drug you, they will put you in a room with a hooker and a kid or something, and then try to make you a compromised operative.
[03:16:37.624 --> 03:16:38.444]  That's not going to happen.
[03:16:38.444 --> 03:16:40.226]  I don't care what they do, I'm not going along with them.
[03:16:40.226 --> 03:16:41.907]  But that is exactly what's going on.
[03:16:41.907 --> 03:16:53.397]  Our reporters have actually chased Petraeus through the streets of Germany before, and Bilderberg, and the word is Petraeus represents the Saudis and other groups, and McMaster is basically his minion.
[03:16:54.318 --> 03:16:55.519]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[03:16:55.519 --> 03:17:01.002]  So what they're actually calling this now with McMaster is the Afghanistan plan.
[03:17:01.002 --> 03:17:11.327]  I actually have another big story that I can break with you, but I was told I can't break it today because if I broke it today, you know, so we have, man, we're going to have so many stories, you and I are going to believe it.
[03:17:11.327 --> 03:17:17.130]  Because a lot of them you can't, I can't let out right away because it might be something only one person knows.
[03:17:17.130 --> 03:17:19.752]  That's how high level my sources are.
[03:17:19.752 --> 03:17:23.254]  That's right, you've got to wait until the orders are going into the second, third, fourth stratus.
[03:17:23.934 --> 03:17:24.795]  Right, right, exactly.
[03:17:24.795 --> 03:17:26.555]  But we got more big stories for you.
[03:17:26.555 --> 03:17:28.016]  I have to be careful I don't break them right now.
[03:17:28.016 --> 03:17:29.297]  There's so many.
[03:17:29.297 --> 03:17:35.740]  And Petraeus is working for the Saudis, and that's where all those articles in the New York Times are coming out against you and me.
[03:17:35.740 --> 03:17:37.301]  I mean, think about it this way.
[03:17:37.301 --> 03:17:42.704]  Who cares about some random person you talked to 20 years ago, right?
[03:17:42.964 --> 03:17:45.969]  But they've said now they're going to go to a fine-tooth comb.
[03:17:45.969 --> 03:17:51.739]  People that I went to junior high with are actually being called and they're going, did you ever hear a servant say the N-word?
[03:17:51.739 --> 03:17:52.881]  You know, is he a racist?
[03:17:52.881 --> 03:17:53.302]  Is he this?
[03:17:53.302 --> 03:17:55.125]  The exact same thing is going on with me.
[03:17:56.055 --> 03:17:56.836]  Right, exactly.
[03:17:56.836 --> 03:18:07.184]  Well, I was told that they're going after all of us now, and they're going to interview people from 20, 30 years ago and say, give us something on him, even if it's not true, we'll keep it anonymous.
[03:18:07.184 --> 03:18:15.210]  By the way, you told me on air two weeks before you got your sources to give you the info that we were being targeted by Deep State, multi-million dollar campaign to delist us on Google.
[03:18:15.210 --> 03:18:20.034]  Then you got the actual document where it was happening, the info wars, and 48 hours later Google admitted it.
[03:18:20.034 --> 03:18:20.655]  I mean, that's big.
[03:18:21.522 --> 03:18:26.044]  Yeah, yeah, that was another story that we broke for you.
[03:18:26.044 --> 03:18:28.386]  People said, oh no, that isn't how it works.
[03:18:28.386 --> 03:18:35.810]  And then Google actually had to admit that they were targeting you specifically, and of course they're gonna target all of us.
[03:18:35.810 --> 03:18:45.715]  That's the thing, this is a big operation involving the highest levels of people, Petraeus, the Saudis, the New York Times, which of course is basically run by the Saudis now.
[03:18:45.715 --> 03:18:47.536]  They're gonna put whatever they have to.
[03:18:47.536 --> 03:18:50.598]  This is what I've been telling people as I go,
[03:18:51.298 --> 03:18:56.682]  Expect more mean, nasty hit pieces on me, on you, and they know not to believe it.
[03:18:56.682 --> 03:19:02.305]  Well sure, I mean they openly admitted they wanted to ruin my whole life, but what is it, what's up with the Muslims?
[03:19:02.305 --> 03:19:11.351]  I mean, they come in, they run over us, they shoot us, they kill us, and our government backs the most radical, and then they actually think they're going to shut us all up.
[03:19:11.351 --> 03:19:13.693]  But I guess most people do shut up when they get threatened by them.
[03:19:14.465 --> 03:19:23.707]  Well, maybe your producers can pull up that image of the CIA director or somebody in the CIA giving Saudi Arabia a Human Rights Award.
[03:19:23.707 --> 03:19:25.947]  I thought that was a prank when I saw it on Twitter.
[03:19:25.947 --> 03:19:26.927]  That's right.
[03:19:26.927 --> 03:19:29.268]  Brennan and others have gotten awards.
[03:19:29.268 --> 03:19:30.428]  They're Wahhabists.
[03:19:30.428 --> 03:19:35.769]  And they've now put the Saudis on the Women's Rights Council and the Human Rights Council a few years ago.
[03:19:35.769 --> 03:19:38.249]  Now the women's rights, they're going to run the women's rights.
[03:19:38.249 --> 03:19:39.429]  Don't let them drive.
[03:19:39.429 --> 03:19:41.090]  Don't let them go out without an adult.
[03:19:41.090 --> 03:19:43.210]  Beat them with sticks like they're dogs hurting
[03:19:43.750 --> 03:19:53.938]  Yeah, and they got an award for fighting terrorism.
[03:19:53.938 --> 03:19:55.059]  You can't make this stuff up.
[03:19:55.059 --> 03:19:57.400]  Yeah, that's by the CIA director.
[03:19:57.400 --> 03:19:59.862]  Yeah, when I saw the image I thought it was a prank or something.
[03:19:59.862 --> 03:20:01.664]  I go, this can't be real, this is Photoshop.
[03:20:02.597 --> 03:20:03.397]  No, it was real.
[03:20:03.397 --> 03:20:04.817]  So the Saudis do control it.
[03:20:04.817 --> 03:20:07.098]  And if you notice, yeah, this is disgusting.
[03:20:07.098 --> 03:20:08.438]  That actually really happened.
[03:20:08.438 --> 03:20:13.579]  The CIA honored the Saudis for fighting terrorism.
[03:20:13.579 --> 03:20:15.079]  I thought I was being pranked, Alex.
[03:20:15.079 --> 03:20:17.860]  I thought there's no way in the world this is true.
[03:20:17.860 --> 03:20:23.361]  There's no way that this is possibly true, that anybody would honor these terrorist funders.
[03:20:23.361 --> 03:20:25.361]  Well, let me ask you this, and I'm going to skip the break and take some calls.
[03:20:25.361 --> 03:20:27.362]  I'm going to get out here and let you host, because you've got a lot to do here.
[03:20:27.362 --> 03:20:27.942]  But I ran over.
[03:20:29.537 --> 03:20:45.302]  What do you make of Trump saying, I love Assange, he's great, release more, and now his Attorney General, who I really like, you know, 90% is doing good stuff, and the CIA Director saying, we need to arrest Assange, he's an enemy foreign intelligence agency, was the exact quote.
[03:20:45.302 --> 03:20:47.903]  No, he's a patriot, and so is Snowden.
[03:20:48.939 --> 03:20:49.739]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:20:49.739 --> 03:20:53.181]  I've said that if they go after Assange, I'll lead a march on D.C.
[03:20:53.181 --> 03:20:57.504]  And I'll just tell the Bernie people, I'll say, look, let's set aside our differences.
[03:20:57.504 --> 03:20:59.345]  We're going to march to D.C.
[03:20:59.345 --> 03:21:00.566]  That will not stand.
[03:21:00.566 --> 03:21:02.066]  That will not stand at all.
[03:21:02.066 --> 03:21:02.927]  They are patriots.
[03:21:02.927 --> 03:21:06.029]  This journalism in its purest form, they are patriots.
[03:21:06.029 --> 03:21:09.951]  And if they go after them, they're going to realize there's going to be an incredible pushback.
[03:21:09.951 --> 03:21:10.711]  And it was U.S.
[03:21:10.711 --> 03:21:12.592]  intelligence that gave everything to Wikileaks.
[03:21:12.592 --> 03:21:13.573]  It wasn't the Russians.
[03:21:14.807 --> 03:21:16.088]  Yeah, it might have been Seth Rich, too.
[03:21:33.908 --> 03:21:44.401]  Right, exactly, and that is why getting McMaster his four-star general position, we just have to hold our nose and congratulate him and say, thank you sir, you're an American hero, and then get somebody in.
[03:21:44.401 --> 03:21:50.088]  But that's the problem, he went to four other people after they got rid of Flynn, they all said no, until he hit McMaster.
[03:21:50.689 --> 03:21:53.471]  And I'll tell you why, too.
[03:21:53.471 --> 03:22:00.174]  One of the appointees, I can't tell you who, he was actually told he had a very unconventional personal life.
[03:22:00.174 --> 03:22:01.095]  And we'll just leave it at that.
[03:22:01.095 --> 03:22:08.279]  It wasn't anything illegal or shady, but he just had an unconventional arrangement with consenting adults and everything.
[03:22:08.279 --> 03:22:15.063]  And he was told by the New York Times, if you accept this position, we'll expose all of your secrets to the whole world.
[03:22:15.063 --> 03:22:19.646]  And he was, you know, he would have destroyed his family and messed up a lot of things, even though it was nothing illegal.
[03:22:20.646 --> 03:22:21.847]  The way he was living his life.
[03:22:21.847 --> 03:22:32.739]  So the media is actually now telling people, if you accept a position with Trump, we will dig up every detail about your personal life, no matter how embarrassing, even if we have to make it up, and we'll destroy your reputation.
[03:22:32.739 --> 03:22:34.981]  We'll go full on character assassination.
[03:22:34.981 --> 03:22:36.222]  That's why it's so important.
[03:22:36.843 --> 03:22:45.289]  For everybody listening to support the Freedom Fighters, you know, take the caveman bra off, take the supplements, buy the toothpaste, because they don't get it.
[03:22:45.289 --> 03:22:49.232]  Every day of our lives, there are people talking to people who know us in junior high.
[03:22:49.232 --> 03:22:51.713]  My God, who knows what is going to be out there?
[03:22:51.713 --> 03:22:54.936]  And most people can't withstand that type of character assassination.
[03:22:55.977 --> 03:22:57.037]  That's right.
[03:22:57.037 --> 03:22:59.739]  They're putting out the message that if you expose us, we're going to destroy you.
[03:22:59.739 --> 03:23:03.863]  It doesn't matter if they fail destroying Cernovich or Drudge or myself or anybody else.
[03:23:03.863 --> 03:23:05.084]  They want to scare all the sheep.
[03:23:05.084 --> 03:23:07.465]  Sheep, you should be afraid of not taking action.
[03:23:07.465 --> 03:23:11.409]  I know our audience are not the sheep, but I'm talking to the few sheep that might be tuned in right now.
[03:23:11.409 --> 03:23:19.074]  That's why we're running a big specials today where we direct sell high quality products to you that you need like high quality non-fluoride toothpaste with
[03:23:19.955 --> 03:23:25.440]  All the great iodine and colloidal silver and tea tree oil and peppermint in it, that's back in stock.
[03:23:25.440 --> 03:23:29.583]  30% off on that, 30% off on so many other great products.
[03:23:29.583 --> 03:23:36.949]  During the 30-hour broadcast that runs through tomorrow, DNA Force is now finally back in stock, but such a limited supply will be gone in a few days.
[03:23:36.949 --> 03:23:43.715]  Unfortunately, 30% off Brain Force, 20% off Secret 12, Vitamin B12, Knockout Sleep Aid Formula, 20% off Winter Sun, Vitamin D.
[03:23:44.395 --> 03:23:53.038]  20% off Prostagard, 20% off BioPCA for your nails and hair, 20% off Biome Defense Probiotic, 20% off Living Defense.
[03:23:53.038 --> 03:23:54.818]  It's all there, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:23:54.818 --> 03:23:56.359]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:23:56.359 --> 03:24:00.300]  The books, the t-shirts, the videos, the water filters, all top of the line.
[03:24:00.660 --> 03:24:03.943]  High quality stuff you need that then helps fund this operation.
[03:24:03.943 --> 03:24:08.266]  Let's take a few calls and then I'm gonna get out of here and let Mike Cernovich take over.
[03:24:08.266 --> 03:24:11.609]  Let's go ahead right now and let's go to Uncle Sam.
[03:24:11.609 --> 03:24:15.792]  Says he has a clip of a teacher who wants Alex Jones taken down.
[03:24:15.792 --> 03:24:20.356]  We've all seen teachers saying kill Trump, but what's going on Uncle Sam from Louisiana?
[03:24:21.792 --> 03:24:23.174]  Hi Alex.
[03:24:23.174 --> 03:24:29.164]  First I want to thank you for having my good friend Professor Iris Mack on after she appeared on your show.
[03:24:29.164 --> 03:24:34.112]  Her book, A Wall Street Bailout from Main Street, shot up to number one.
[03:24:34.841 --> 03:24:39.284]  So that's a testament to your power of your broadcast.
[03:24:39.284 --> 03:24:46.349]  And I also want to say, at 69 years of age, I could not do what I'm doing if I wasn't taking your supplements.
[03:24:46.349 --> 03:24:48.650]  I applaud Caveman.
[03:24:48.650 --> 03:24:52.373]  I'm telling you, it gives me the strength to pull the Infowar wagon.
[03:24:52.373 --> 03:24:55.995]  Thank you, brother.
[03:24:55.995 --> 03:25:03.681]  Now, the other day, this giant of a man, 6'5", maybe 240 pounds, and his wife come walking up to the Infowar wagon.
[03:25:04.401 --> 03:25:07.623]  And she notices, of course, the ample war sign.
[03:25:07.623 --> 03:25:09.204]  And she goes, you listen to him?
[03:25:09.204 --> 03:25:11.885]  I go, yes, because he ought to be killed.
[03:25:11.885 --> 03:25:13.446]  I go, excuse me?
[03:25:13.446 --> 03:25:25.233]  And she goes on for five minutes as I'm trying to ask her to explain herself how she reconciled want the journalist killed and at the same time support the First Amendment.
[03:25:25.233 --> 03:25:30.536]  She goes on for five minutes in the most unbelievable twisted logic.
[03:25:31.587 --> 03:25:44.352]  You have a bicycle, I think it is, and you drag around these huge Jumbotron TVs educating people about freedom and playing clips of my show in New Orleans.
[03:25:44.352 --> 03:25:45.492]  You have a great effect, right?
[03:25:45.492 --> 03:25:45.932]  That's you.
[03:25:45.932 --> 03:25:48.553]  That's correct.
[03:25:48.553 --> 03:25:50.994]  And so tell people your YouTube channel again, Uncle Sam.
[03:25:52.506 --> 03:26:02.554]  Yeah, it's under my name, Michael D. Barry, that's M-I-C-H-A-L, of course, D. Barry, D-I, capital B-A-R-I.
[03:26:02.554 --> 03:26:08.418]  Okay, and you say you have a tape of this lady saying I need to be killed?
[03:26:08.418 --> 03:26:16.304]  Five minutes and 17 seconds of this woman, and it's called, Teacher Wants Alex Jones Killed.
[03:26:17.173 --> 03:26:19.114]  Okay, we will get it and put it up on YouTube.
[03:26:19.114 --> 03:26:21.695]  You've shown us a lot of viral videos over the years.
[03:26:21.695 --> 03:26:22.155]  Amazing.
[03:26:22.155 --> 03:26:30.779]  What do you make of one of the Federal Reserve Board of New York, that runs the whole Federal Reserve, a foreigner, suing me, and it's George Soros' founded law firm.
[03:26:30.779 --> 03:26:33.740]  He founded it with his money, suing me.
[03:26:33.740 --> 03:26:35.961]  What do you make of that?
[03:26:35.961 --> 03:26:37.442]  You can't make this stuff up.
[03:26:38.248 --> 03:26:50.431]  I mean, if you were to write a script of what's going on and took it into a producer and told them that this is the script, they'd throw you out of there.
[03:26:50.431 --> 03:26:53.092]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[03:26:53.092 --> 03:27:00.794]  But of course, you obviously are right over the target now because you've got the biggest guns on the ship aiming at you.
[03:27:01.394 --> 03:27:03.436]  Well, absolutely, and it's what we represent.
[03:27:03.436 --> 03:27:07.801]  They just think they can destroy us, intimidate us, and they intimidate the Mike Cernovich's of the world, which aren't going to happen.
[03:27:07.801 --> 03:27:08.782]  God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[03:27:08.782 --> 03:27:12.546]  I'm going to come back to Eileen, Jessica, Nathan, and Shane's calls real quick, then I'm out of here.
[03:27:12.546 --> 03:27:14.808]  But Mike, they just brought this in.
[03:27:14.808 --> 03:27:19.313]  Obviously, I've said publicly, I'm going to add probably 10, 12 hours of broadcast a day.
[03:27:19.313 --> 03:27:20.835]  If GCN wants to work with me, that's fine.
[03:27:20.835 --> 03:27:23.317]  If not, I've got my own radio satellites, but I'm sure they will.
[03:27:23.317 --> 03:27:23.898]  But we need to get
[03:27:24.258 --> 03:27:29.239]  Mike Stern has been showing me how to get other people to round table shows so that people can sometimes be out of town if they want.
[03:27:29.239 --> 03:27:34.881]  But I'm going to have shows where three people, three men and women, host the shows and that way there's always two of them there.
[03:27:34.881 --> 03:27:37.882]  TV slash radio, we have affiliates everywhere begging for it.
[03:27:37.882 --> 03:27:41.543]  And so Mike's announcing he's going to be hosting one hour a week while he gets ready for it the next few months.
[03:27:43.183 --> 03:27:45.844]  We're going to be launching all of this, and I'm hiring more crew to do it.
[03:27:45.844 --> 03:27:47.465]  That's why we need the funding.
[03:27:47.465 --> 03:27:49.627]  And now, it's top story on CNN.
[03:27:49.627 --> 03:27:54.189]  Right-wing troll Mike Cernovich goes professional with new hosting gig at Impor.
[03:27:54.189 --> 03:27:57.571]  So, he wasn't professional with millions of readers five years ago.
[03:27:57.571 --> 03:28:00.192]  He wasn't professional with a best-selling book years ago.
[03:28:00.192 --> 03:28:04.875]  He wasn't professional breaking all these huge stories, and Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr.
[03:28:04.875 --> 03:28:07.356]  tweeting him all the time, and breaking all this news.
[03:28:07.356 --> 03:28:11.699]  They admit, Bloomberg admits, they all admit, no, no, no, he's not professional.
[03:28:12.579 --> 03:28:26.714]  And then they go on to say, in the article, in the third to the last paragraph, while most of the reports may not be accurate, they can point to legitimate scoops corroborated by mainstream news outlets as evidence they should be trusted on everything else they report.
[03:28:26.714 --> 03:28:28.756]  But they don't show what it is they say is fake, Mike.
[03:28:30.424 --> 03:28:31.665]  Yeah, they never do.
[03:28:31.665 --> 03:28:35.287]  That's that low-key shade kind of stuff.
[03:28:35.287 --> 03:28:45.353]  I always tell them, show me... For example, you and I both reported that Anthony Weiner was a child pornographer and that his wife, Uma, arranged perhaps underage girls.
[03:28:45.353 --> 03:28:50.996]  Comey admitted today that Uma was sending emails to Anthony Weiner, a child pornographer.
[03:28:50.996 --> 03:28:52.957]  The FBI verified it today.
[03:28:52.957 --> 03:28:55.338]  And that Hillary was sending classified to Uma.
[03:28:55.338 --> 03:28:56.059]  We all broke that.
[03:28:56.874 --> 03:28:57.895]  Right, exactly.
[03:28:57.895 --> 03:29:05.624]  So, the problem is that their sources in the conventional media are so low-level, all they do is they read Twitter.
[03:29:05.624 --> 03:29:08.167]  Yeah, no one trusts mainstream news.
[03:29:08.167 --> 03:29:09.128]  No one talks to them.
[03:29:09.128 --> 03:29:10.389]  The Trump people don't talk to them.
[03:29:10.389 --> 03:29:11.571]  And that's what they can't stand.
[03:29:12.571 --> 03:29:13.472]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:29:13.472 --> 03:29:18.296]  So a lot of stuff we report is not proven until years later.
[03:29:18.296 --> 03:29:21.099]  So the UMA thing you were all over, I was on it.
[03:29:21.099 --> 03:29:23.581]  We all said Anthony Weiner.
[03:29:23.581 --> 03:29:26.363]  I even went back and found old tweets of mine from a year ago.
[03:29:26.363 --> 03:29:34.210]  The FBI had told me Anthony Weiner actually had the full computer with every email on it.
[03:29:34.210 --> 03:29:35.712]  Comey confirmed that today.
[03:29:35.712 --> 03:29:36.853]  Now, he didn't say all of them.
[03:29:37.133 --> 03:29:38.934]  But he goes, there were thousands.
[03:29:38.934 --> 03:29:42.437]  No, there were 33,000, Comey, and Comey is a freakin' traitor.
[03:29:42.437 --> 03:29:44.279]  I gotta watch my language.
[03:29:44.279 --> 03:29:46.981]  All 33,000, Wiener has them all.
[03:29:46.981 --> 03:29:51.224]  Alright, we're gonna come right back with Mike Cernovich, the wrecking ball of the New World Order.
[03:29:51.224 --> 03:29:53.446]  Super accurate, so they call him super fake.
[03:29:53.446 --> 03:29:56.529]  We'll be right back with Nathan, Jesse, Eileen, Shane, Lynch.
[03:29:56.529 --> 03:29:59.071]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:59.071 --> 03:30:01.733]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:07.482 --> 03:30:21.365]  All the perplexities, the confusion and distress in America arise not from objects in their Constitution or Confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.
[03:30:21.365 --> 03:30:25.646]  Those are the words of John Adams, the second President of the United States.
[03:30:25.646 --> 03:30:27.607]  Are you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve?
[03:30:28.207 --> 03:30:30.350]  Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency?
[03:30:30.350 --> 03:30:37.538]  Do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles and to profit from it?
[03:30:37.538 --> 03:30:42.283]  What kind of leverage do these people in the Federal Reserve have over the American people?
[03:30:42.283 --> 03:30:46.028]  Or for that matter, what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money?
[03:30:46.588 --> 03:30:49.070]  Will you be a slave or will you be free?
[03:30:49.070 --> 03:30:54.074]  Adams also said, liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people.

[03:32:05.803 --> 03:32:11.266]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:32:11.266 --> 03:32:13.347]  Research across the board is clear.
[03:32:13.347 --> 03:32:18.630]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[03:32:18.630 --> 03:32:22.412]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants that
[03:32:22.492 --> 03:32:25.935]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[03:32:25.935 --> 03:32:29.117]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[03:32:29.117 --> 03:32:33.001]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[03:32:33.001 --> 03:32:40.166]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[03:32:40.166 --> 03:32:45.571]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[03:32:45.831 --> 03:32:47.874]  Iodine, nano, silver, and more.
[03:32:47.874 --> 03:32:56.164]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we've created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is Spearmint free.
[03:32:56.164 --> 03:33:04.475]  Learn more about the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at InfoWarsLife.com and support the Info War while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[03:33:11.622 --> 03:33:14.744]  Mike Cernovich, coming to you from Southern California.
[03:33:14.744 --> 03:33:16.325]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[03:33:16.325 --> 03:33:19.868]  We'll be hosting the next hour and a half after we finish a few phone calls.
[03:33:19.868 --> 03:33:26.612]  If you're receiving this transmission... If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:26.612 --> 03:33:32.576]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:32.576 --> 03:33:35.298]  Revolution in their heart!
[03:33:35.298 --> 03:33:36.579]  Children start to march!
[03:33:50.167 --> 03:33:51.718]  They just can't stand it at CNN.
[03:33:54.034 --> 03:33:58.958]  There's dynamos out there like Mike Cernovich and then Matt Drudge has 20 times the traffic they've got.
[03:33:58.958 --> 03:34:01.640]  Just blast stuff right through their blockades.
[03:34:01.640 --> 03:34:02.580]  At DrudgeReport.com.
[03:34:02.580 --> 03:34:04.522]  They can't stand Infowars.com.
[03:34:04.522 --> 03:34:05.563]  They can't stand you.
[03:34:05.563 --> 03:34:07.144]  They don't want you to have a voice.
[03:34:07.144 --> 03:34:08.004]  They're better than you.
[03:34:08.004 --> 03:34:09.165]  Now let's take four or five calls quick.
[03:34:09.165 --> 03:34:12.908]  I gotta get out of here because I want to get Cernovich here hosting.
[03:34:12.908 --> 03:34:14.909]  I just promised to take phone calls.
[03:34:14.909 --> 03:34:20.473]  Mike, let's take a call here from Nathan in Kansas to get your take on his question or comment.
[03:34:20.473 --> 03:34:21.074]  Go ahead, Nathan.
[03:34:22.882 --> 03:34:27.205]  Yeah, hey Alex, it's great talking to you and it's great to be in your company as well, Mike.
[03:34:27.205 --> 03:34:29.867]  Thank you.
[03:34:29.867 --> 03:34:34.149]  It sounds like the wind's kind of out of your sails as far as Trump's concerned?
[03:34:34.149 --> 03:34:36.591]  A little bit, maybe?
[03:34:36.591 --> 03:34:39.833]  I mean, Trump's starting to go a little bit off trajectory.
[03:34:39.833 --> 03:34:41.474]  I'm surprised he's gotten this much done.
[03:34:41.474 --> 03:34:43.255]  I mean, as surrounded as he is, but let's get
[03:34:44.286 --> 03:34:46.669]  I mean, are you saying are we disenchanted with Trump?
[03:34:46.669 --> 03:34:46.909]  No.
[03:34:46.909 --> 03:34:49.292]  I mean, I know he's for real.
[03:34:49.292 --> 03:34:53.577]  It's just that I can barely run my own little operation with 65 employees.
[03:34:53.577 --> 03:34:55.960]  Imagine what Trump's doing and he's trying to get stuff done.
[03:34:55.960 --> 03:34:57.422]  He has to compromise.
[03:34:57.422 --> 03:34:57.622]  Mike?
[03:34:58.686 --> 03:34:59.007]  Right.
[03:34:59.007 --> 03:35:02.131]  The thing that I want to make clear is Alex Jones is a journalist.
[03:35:02.131 --> 03:35:03.874]  Mike Cernovich is a journalist.
[03:35:03.874 --> 03:35:05.897]  Our job is to report the truth, whatever it is.
[03:35:05.897 --> 03:35:13.188]  So even though we're pro-Trump, and we're honest about that, when the news breaks, we still owe it to our readers.
[03:35:13.188 --> 03:35:13.969]  Because remember,
[03:35:14.750 --> 03:35:19.194]  The people listening in, the freedom fighters, they're going to be around when I'm gone.
[03:35:19.194 --> 03:35:22.717]  They're going to be around when Alex is gone, when Trump is gone, when everybody's gone.
[03:35:22.717 --> 03:35:26.921]  We have to serve you the truthful information and give you all the real news.
[03:35:26.921 --> 03:35:27.522]  Exactly!
[03:35:27.522 --> 03:35:32.006]  Even if we don't like something Trump's doing, we report it because we're not the Democrats or CNN.
[03:35:32.006 --> 03:35:33.187]  We're going to tell you what's going on.
[03:35:34.119 --> 03:35:34.639]  Exactly.
[03:35:34.639 --> 03:35:38.460]  We don't cover up for something that Trump's administration does.
[03:35:38.460 --> 03:35:42.041]  So a lot of people get confused because they go, but wait a minute, I thought you liked Trump.
[03:35:42.041 --> 03:35:43.641]  We're not political operatives.
[03:35:43.641 --> 03:35:44.202]  Exactly.
[03:35:44.202 --> 03:35:45.782]  You're so smart the way you put it.
[03:35:45.782 --> 03:35:47.082]  I wish I... That's it.
[03:35:47.082 --> 03:35:49.403]  People keep saying, well, wait, this article's pro-Trump.
[03:35:49.403 --> 03:35:50.843]  This article's anti-Trump.
[03:35:50.843 --> 03:35:52.444]  Yeah, it's wrong to want to arrest Assange.
[03:35:52.444 --> 03:35:53.204]  We say that.
[03:35:53.204 --> 03:35:55.684]  It's right to want to cut taxes.
[03:35:55.684 --> 03:35:57.465]  It's right to take out ISIS.
[03:35:57.465 --> 03:35:58.725]  It's right to kill TPP.
[03:35:58.725 --> 03:36:01.926]  I mean, don't people understand you can have multi, you know, different issues?
[03:36:03.032 --> 03:36:09.154]  Well, they're so used to conventional media where they're all in bed with the Democrats, right?
[03:36:09.154 --> 03:36:28.601]  They won't tell the truth about Anthony Weiner being a child pornographer, about how he told... This is so... What Anthony Weiner said is so out of line that I have to be careful when I say I'm family-friendly, but he told this 15-year-old girl, basically, that I would be so intimate with you, so vigorously, that you wouldn't be able to walk for a week.
[03:36:28.601 --> 03:36:29.662]  This is a true story.
[03:36:30.282 --> 03:36:37.846]  That's Uma's husband, and he read Hillary Clinton's emails, all these classified emails, and James Comey's talking about Russia.
[03:36:37.846 --> 03:36:39.026]  What about the Muslim Brotherhood?
[03:36:39.026 --> 03:36:40.767]  What about the Mojave terrorists?
[03:36:40.767 --> 03:36:44.929]  Uma's family is connected to a pro-Syria law journal.
[03:36:44.929 --> 03:36:47.931]  Uma was an editor at a pro-Syria law journal.
[03:36:47.931 --> 03:36:51.393]  Her mother is the leading genital mutilation pusher in the world.
[03:36:52.233 --> 03:36:52.714]  Here it is.
[03:36:52.714 --> 03:36:55.896]  Comey says classified Clinton emails were forwarded to Anthony Weiner.
[03:36:55.896 --> 03:36:56.477]  Here's another one.
[03:36:56.477 --> 03:36:58.118]  New Uma Abedin emails.
[03:36:58.118 --> 03:37:00.980]  29 previously undisclosed Clinton emails with classified information.
[03:37:00.980 --> 03:37:03.062]  But Hillary says she didn't win because she's a woman.
[03:37:05.526 --> 03:37:13.471]  Yeah, Russia, I'm a woman, WikiLeaks, misogyny, and then she even said at one point, well, there are people you can't even get cell phone reception.
[03:37:13.471 --> 03:37:15.333]  It's such a joke.
[03:37:15.333 --> 03:37:16.073]  Yeah, there you go.
[03:37:16.073 --> 03:37:18.014]  May 3rd, 2017.
[03:37:18.014 --> 03:37:22.757]  But if you go on InfoWars.com or if you go on my Twitter, we told you this
[03:37:23.838 --> 03:37:28.402]  Over a year ago because our sources in the FBI had told us this information.
[03:37:28.402 --> 03:37:40.511]  So for a year people go, because I reported that the FBI had Hillary's lost 33,000 emails and that Wiener had them on the laptop and people go, oh Cernovich, that's not right.
[03:37:40.511 --> 03:37:42.233]  Well Comey is now confirming it.
[03:37:42.873 --> 03:37:45.634]  But he won't confirm it all away because he is embedded.
[03:37:45.634 --> 03:37:48.995]  But the more everything we say is confirmed, the more we're fake.
[03:37:48.995 --> 03:37:50.696]  But it doesn't work anymore because the people know.
[03:37:50.696 --> 03:37:51.936]  So where do you see this?
[03:37:51.936 --> 03:37:52.596]  Thank you, Nathan.
[03:37:52.596 --> 03:37:53.576]  A good question.
[03:37:53.576 --> 03:38:00.839]  Where do you see this confluence of them losing credibility, the independent media gaining credibility because we tell the truth and want to be free.
[03:38:00.839 --> 03:38:03.700]  I mean, and plus you get more listeners doing the right thing.
[03:38:03.700 --> 03:38:03.760]  Wow.
[03:38:04.820 --> 03:38:08.043]  Imagine, you know, good service, good food, a restaurant, more people come.
[03:38:08.043 --> 03:38:10.244]  Yeah, bad service, bad food, nobody comes.
[03:38:10.244 --> 03:38:12.846]  I mean, we have an incentive to tell the truth, too.
[03:38:12.846 --> 03:38:16.068]  They have an incentive to lie, because they're not about news, they're about propaganda.
[03:38:16.068 --> 03:38:18.650]  How do these two forces come together?
[03:38:18.650 --> 03:38:25.816]  Right, well, the good thing that is, and this is why they're going after people's, well, I mean, as you know, they're going after you hard, they're trying to bankrupt you, which is
[03:38:26.730 --> 03:38:30.355]  You and I, we don't have billionaire sugar daddy backers.
[03:38:30.355 --> 03:38:32.037]  We have to be backed by the people.
[03:38:32.037 --> 03:38:41.169]  You know, every dollar, every five dollars, every little thing from the people helps because we're crowdfunding and that is the big revolution of new media.
[03:38:41.730 --> 03:38:44.033]  We're not beholden to George Sosa's world.
[03:38:44.033 --> 03:38:46.857]  The Chobani guy, we're not beholden to him.
[03:38:46.857 --> 03:38:49.000]  All these billionaires, they want to fund fake news.
[03:38:49.000 --> 03:38:55.568]  Chris Thaka, actually, is leaving now Venture Capital, become a full-time social justice lawyer.
[03:38:55.568 --> 03:38:58.532]  So all these billionaires are funding propaganda outlets.
[03:38:59.193 --> 03:39:02.415]  They're all getting recruited because they're all cronies.
[03:39:02.415 --> 03:39:03.496]  Take the Shabani guy.
[03:39:03.496 --> 03:39:06.258]  He gets his money by a monopoly on the school lunch program.
[03:39:06.258 --> 03:39:07.899]  He's on the Federal Reserve Board.
[03:39:07.899 --> 03:39:08.920]  He's in with Soros.
[03:39:08.920 --> 03:39:10.981]  He's pushing all this stuff.
[03:39:10.981 --> 03:39:16.605]  And then he's suing me saying I said immigrant Muslims without vetting bring tuberculosis.
[03:39:16.605 --> 03:39:20.788]  It's mainstream news, the town he brought all the people into or pushed to be brought in.
[03:39:20.788 --> 03:39:22.769]  I have a 500% increase.
[03:39:22.769 --> 03:39:27.492]  I'm not saying he consciously did that, but it's a fact that a lot of these Islamists coming in have TB.
[03:39:27.492 --> 03:39:28.073]  That's a fact!
[03:39:29.039 --> 03:39:37.143]  Yeah, that lawsuit I think is a big mistake because in discovery, you're going to want to get emails, employer records, how does he know George Soros?
[03:39:37.143 --> 03:39:40.745]  I don't know what he's doing with that, but that was a very bad... Well, let me expand.
[03:39:40.745 --> 03:39:44.107]  You read the lawsuit before I even did because I heard about the suit in the news.
[03:39:44.107 --> 03:39:45.928]  It was two days until I got it.
[03:39:45.928 --> 03:39:50.210]  You went online as a lawyer, found it, sent it to me, and you said this is a total joke.
[03:39:50.210 --> 03:39:54.492]  I've had five law firms look at it because I don't want to just believe that.
[03:39:54.492 --> 03:39:55.112]  They're good law firms.
[03:39:55.112 --> 03:39:57.934]  Some of them are the top people in the country that have fought these folks before and won.
[03:39:59.386 --> 03:40:01.668]  I got the top Utah guy, I got the top D.C.
[03:40:01.668 --> 03:40:02.790]  guys, that's what I've got.
[03:40:02.790 --> 03:40:08.796]  The people that represent the Boston Herald, you know, had a similar group come after him and they beat him and got money back.
[03:40:08.796 --> 03:40:13.601]  But the point is, is that, they said, we can't believe how bad this suit is.
[03:40:13.601 --> 03:40:17.045]  It's all written wrong, it was delivered wrong, all the stuff they say isn't right.
[03:40:17.045 --> 03:40:18.706]  I mean, they don't even know why they did it.
[03:40:18.706 --> 03:40:21.630]  They think maybe a publicity stunt, I mean, what do you think they did it for?
[03:40:22.403 --> 03:40:26.866]  Yeah, I think what they did as a publicity stunt, they expected you to back down.
[03:40:26.866 --> 03:40:38.374]  Because something, too, that the media tries to tell about us, which is an absolute lie, is you and I both did the right thing when a certain person, when a story took a different direction than it should have.
[03:40:38.894 --> 03:40:42.118]  You know, you and I, we talk about pedophilia, it's the elite pedophilia.
[03:40:42.118 --> 03:40:48.507]  There's actually, the Associated Press is breaking a story about how children are being smuggled into Iraq.
[03:40:48.507 --> 03:40:50.670]  You can probably find that in the AP's Twitter page.
[03:40:50.670 --> 03:40:53.754]  An AP just broke the UN, 2,000 kids raped, many of them killed.
[03:40:55.035 --> 03:41:05.858]  In Haiti, we had a crew there just last year, Zimmerman, saying that a year before the AP, but we halfway go off on other reports about a pizza place, then they say we're the creators of the story.
[03:41:05.858 --> 03:41:10.080]  We say, oh no, we'll correct where we were wrong, and then they say, oh, we admit we're fake.
[03:41:10.080 --> 03:41:10.900]  No, we don't.
[03:41:10.900 --> 03:41:14.361]  When something in the media turns out to not be accurate, we correct it because we're real.
[03:41:15.342 --> 03:41:16.082]  Right, exactly.
[03:41:16.082 --> 03:41:20.765]  So what happened is because you did the right thing, this Chobani guy thought you looked weak.
[03:41:20.765 --> 03:41:24.467]  He didn't realize you're just one of the only honest men in journalism.
[03:41:24.467 --> 03:41:26.028]  Honest men or women.
[03:41:26.028 --> 03:41:28.589]  And he goes, oh wow, this Jones is weak.
[03:41:28.589 --> 03:41:35.033]  I'm just gonna bully him and I'm gonna shut him down and I'm gonna make him grovel before me and kiss my feet.
[03:41:35.033 --> 03:41:38.515]  Because ultimately, Islam means submission.
[03:41:38.515 --> 03:41:42.237]  And he wants, under his religion, he has to make you an infidel submit to him.
[03:41:43.390 --> 03:41:51.797]  That's right, and we got off the story of Pizzagate by December 3rd because I found that we'd run other people's reports with fake menus.
[03:41:51.797 --> 03:41:58.022]  I called people in and I said, I rarely yell, but I said, what on earth are we doing running fake menus?
[03:41:58.022 --> 03:41:59.663]  I went and looked this up, this isn't accurate.
[03:41:59.663 --> 03:42:00.944]  I said, remove it all.
[03:42:00.944 --> 03:42:03.766]  I even have the memos of a few people, they're good folks.
[03:42:03.766 --> 03:42:07.149]  And I said, what is your problem?
[03:42:07.149 --> 03:42:10.652]  And so I went on air and said, I think this is a distraction, get off of it.
[03:42:11.920 --> 03:42:18.282]  Weeks later, a guy goes in, nobody sees him shoot a bullet, but he supposedly does, and he's this actor, already indicted and all this weird stuff.
[03:42:18.282 --> 03:42:19.022]  That goes on.
[03:42:19.022 --> 03:42:22.863]  Then they go, oh, he retracted because of the shooting.
[03:42:22.863 --> 03:42:24.584]  Oh, and just made up this whole narrative.
[03:42:24.584 --> 03:42:25.324]  No!
[03:42:25.324 --> 03:42:35.527]  When I found out we were running stuff off other people's reports, and CNN was focusing in on that, saying that there was no pedophilia on earth because of this one story, I said it's a setup.
[03:42:36.601 --> 03:42:42.587]  So beyond being a good guy, it was just, I didn't want to get sucked into a fake story, and I smelled it a mile away, so is it the chicken or the egg?
[03:42:42.587 --> 03:42:45.791]  Is it because I backed off the story because I thought it wasn't accurate?
[03:42:45.791 --> 03:42:48.473]  And they thought that was weak?
[03:42:48.473 --> 03:42:50.395]  Or, I mean, which was it?
[03:42:50.395 --> 03:42:53.579]  Was it that I backed off because it was the right thing to do, and then they picked that up, or what was it?
[03:42:54.192 --> 03:43:01.757]  Well, they're not used to people being honest, so they mistook your integrity as weakness, because these people, they're so diseased.
[03:43:01.757 --> 03:43:07.762]  They're such frauds and liars and thieves and everything, that when an honest man enters the room, they think, well, that's a sucker.
[03:43:07.762 --> 03:43:11.584]  Wow, what kind of weak person would actually have integrity and be honest?
[03:43:11.584 --> 03:43:15.547]  But they underestimated you, they underestimated everybody who supports you.
[03:43:15.547 --> 03:43:16.568]  It was a big mistake.
[03:43:17.028 --> 03:43:21.278]  And back to that Pizza Parlor, Comet Pizza Parlor plea deal.
[03:43:21.278 --> 03:43:25.367]  I've done criminal defense work and I've known criminal defense lawyers for 20 years.
[03:43:26.334 --> 03:43:41.159]  And I said, have you ever heard of a case where as part of the plea deal, the person had to say that they were influenced by fake news and people go, they go, look, man, I'm not, I can't say this in public because I know what people call me, you know, names or whatever.
[03:43:41.159 --> 03:43:43.599]  He goes, that doesn't add up.
[03:43:43.599 --> 03:43:51.002]  There's not a criminal defense lawyer in the world who thinks it makes any sense to have the guy say, I did, I shot my gun.
[03:43:52.422 --> 03:43:53.503]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[03:43:53.503 --> 03:43:55.926]  I called the other day and my phone hung up when I was on hold.
[03:44:14.969 --> 03:44:16.472]  My phone battery died.
[03:44:16.472 --> 03:44:23.403]  And I was really just calling to tell you that you walked in that press conference like a boss and handled the media.
[03:44:23.403 --> 03:44:26.809]  And it was great for us to watch that.
[03:44:26.809 --> 03:44:28.131]  Oh, you're nice to say that, my friend.
[03:44:28.908 --> 03:44:37.975]  Yeah, so, yeah, yeah, did you, um, so did you see that clip, Alex, where I went to a White House press briefing and then after it was over, I asked all the fake news people... Oh, I meant to play that.
[03:44:37.975 --> 03:44:45.120]  In fact, can we cue that up where Mike, uh, a few days ago was at the White House press briefing and he says, why aren't you covering the Antifa violence all over the country and the world?
[03:44:45.120 --> 03:44:45.681]  That's a good point.
[03:44:46.670 --> 03:44:53.093]  Yeah, so as you know, because a lot of people, it makes them angry to know that Infowars can get press credentials whenever they want.
[03:44:53.093 --> 03:44:55.574]  Real journalists like I can get press credentials.
[03:44:55.574 --> 03:44:59.276]  So I did a White House press briefing, and it's just like high school.
[03:44:59.276 --> 03:45:02.877]  They were taking pictures of me and being, you know, they didn't think I was there with anybody.
[03:45:02.877 --> 03:45:08.920]  They don't realize I have tons of friends and people watching me, watching my back wherever I go because of a Saudi threat and a Petraeus threat.
[03:45:08.920 --> 03:45:10.921]  I can never be alone, especially in D.C.
[03:45:10.921 --> 03:45:12.162]  They'd throw me in a bus somewhere.
[03:45:13.162 --> 03:45:16.965]  And I try to buy all the rules out.
[03:45:16.965 --> 03:45:23.489]  So the reason I triggered all these people was because they actually all reported me to the press office.
[03:45:23.489 --> 03:45:25.730]  And the press people go, well, what did you get wrong?
[03:45:25.730 --> 03:45:26.891]  He just asked you a question.
[03:45:26.891 --> 03:45:28.132]  I didn't disrupt the meeting.
[03:45:28.132 --> 03:45:29.132]  I didn't yell at anybody.
[03:45:29.132 --> 03:45:30.193]  I didn't use curse words.
[03:45:30.193 --> 03:45:32.154]  I kept it family friendly.
[03:45:32.154 --> 03:45:34.716]  And they were all triggered because they were like, but, but, but.
[03:45:35.516 --> 03:45:44.445]  The real complaint is how dare, how dare anyone turn a mirror onto the media and ask us why we're not covering something.
[03:45:44.445 --> 03:45:46.347]  How dare he do that?
[03:45:46.347 --> 03:45:51.131]  And they were all triggered and they told the press office that I should never be credentialed again.
[03:45:51.131 --> 03:45:56.937]  And then there's fugitives in conservative media who many of them are actually controlled opposition.
[03:45:56.937 --> 03:45:58.318]  They're taking Saudi money too.
[03:45:59.159 --> 03:46:03.443]  They're all trying to get me banned, but they were told by the press office, Cernovich didn't break any rules.
[03:46:03.443 --> 03:46:05.205]  He was very respectful, very courteous.
[03:46:05.205 --> 03:46:06.907]  Yeah, they're trying to find the video.
[03:46:06.907 --> 03:46:07.587]  What was the headline?
[03:46:07.587 --> 03:46:12.032]  It's Cernovich challenges media to report on Antifa violence, right?
[03:46:12.748 --> 03:46:18.232]  Yeah, you can find it on YouTube and you can also find, you can find it on my Twitter.
[03:46:18.232 --> 03:46:25.276]  So if they search, if they just search here, I'll retweet at the top of my timeline and then they can find the Twitter video clip.
[03:46:25.276 --> 03:46:25.957]  Yeah, we'll play that.
[03:46:25.957 --> 03:46:26.537]  Well, here it is.
[03:46:26.537 --> 03:46:28.939]  Let's back it up and play the audio.
[03:46:28.939 --> 03:46:31.881]  This is from Very Fake News.
[03:46:31.881 --> 03:46:33.802]  I guess that's, tell me about that group.
[03:46:33.802 --> 03:46:35.263]  That's a cool sounding name.
[03:46:35.263 --> 03:46:36.404]  And let's go ahead and roll this.
[03:46:36.404 --> 03:46:42.048]  Here's Mike Cernovich at the White House press briefing challenging the real enemy of America that Trump's pointed out the media.
[03:46:42.048 --> 03:46:42.328]  Here it is.
[03:46:43.589 --> 03:46:46.671]  Why will nobody here cover the violence against Trump supporters?
[03:46:46.671 --> 03:46:55.377]  And why will you demand that leaders of the Democrats disavow the violence in the Kifa the way you demanded Trump disavow violence from his supporters?
[03:46:55.377 --> 03:46:57.418]  This is being completely covered up.
[03:46:57.418 --> 03:46:58.339]  You have no answer.
[03:46:59.419 --> 03:47:01.081]  I am, Adam.
[03:47:01.081 --> 03:47:01.521]  I am.
[03:47:01.521 --> 03:47:02.141]  I am a reporter.
[03:47:02.141 --> 03:47:03.683]  I'm a documentary filmmaker.
[03:47:03.683 --> 03:47:12.830]  And I want to know why nobody will demand that the Democrats disavow Antifa violence, terrorism against women happening in America.
[03:47:12.830 --> 03:47:16.373]  Nobody will demand- I realize, of course, this is a Republican president.
[03:47:16.373 --> 03:47:18.474]  We will ask Democrats- Where?
[03:47:18.474 --> 03:47:23.338]  Where's the interview with you demanding that Bernie Sanders disavow Antifa?
[03:47:23.338 --> 03:47:24.839]  Disavow Antifa.
[03:47:24.839 --> 03:47:25.660]  Disavow Antifa.
[03:47:25.660 --> 03:47:27.882]  You're not making his demands the way you did with Trump.
[03:47:28.762 --> 03:47:31.724]  So it's unfair and it's very important that this get out there.
[03:47:31.724 --> 03:47:32.485]  Thank you.
[03:47:32.485 --> 03:47:35.147]  I love how Trump called it seen in very fake news.
[03:47:35.147 --> 03:47:35.987]  I just love that name.
[03:47:35.987 --> 03:47:39.490]  Is very fake news yours or somebody else that shot that?
[03:47:39.490 --> 03:47:46.115]  No, I shot that and look at how angry this MSNBC person, they can find the footage on my media clip too.
[03:47:46.115 --> 03:47:48.296]  Just look at that anger.
[03:47:48.296 --> 03:47:50.298]  These are people, they're not well Alex.
[03:47:50.298 --> 03:47:54.181]  Well, let me expand on that because as you said, they try to get you thrown out.
[03:47:54.181 --> 03:47:54.781]  You just talked
[03:47:54.861 --> 03:47:58.484]  ...to them in a normal tone, like you're talking to a group of people, and they just can't stand it.
[03:47:58.484 --> 03:48:09.451]  They're a bunch of cowards that are given their marching orders to go out with a certain angle, and they're disgusting, and they hardly make any money now, and no one likes them, and they're all just... Those are dinosaurs!
[03:48:09.451 --> 03:48:12.173]  Those are like dodo birds when the sailors arrive.
[03:48:12.173 --> 03:48:13.374]  I mean, they just don't get it, do they?
[03:48:14.286 --> 03:48:15.127]  No, exactly.
[03:48:15.127 --> 03:48:19.709]  And again, thank God for streaming video.
[03:48:19.709 --> 03:48:25.112]  If we didn't have streaming videos and I didn't have somebody periscope, they would have lied.
[03:48:25.112 --> 03:48:26.533]  They would have completely fabricated.
[03:48:26.533 --> 03:48:28.774]  They would have attacked you like a group of vampires.
[03:48:28.774 --> 03:48:30.815]  And you know, you were a baby they snatched out of the forest.
[03:48:30.815 --> 03:48:33.317]  I mean, they would have just come upon you like a bunch of rats.
[03:48:34.284 --> 03:48:35.605]  Yeah, and they couldn't do anything.
[03:48:35.605 --> 03:48:41.147]  So if the, um, you can see that screencap of the image and these people, they're so angry.
[03:48:41.147 --> 03:48:43.328]  They're, they're very toxic people.
[03:48:43.328 --> 03:48:47.510]  And I'm glad I got to show the American people and the freedom fighters who are listening.
[03:48:47.510 --> 03:48:48.050]  Look at that.
[03:48:48.050 --> 03:48:50.671]  That is, that is not a healthy person.
[03:48:50.671 --> 03:48:52.012]  That person right there.
[03:48:52.012 --> 03:48:57.334]  How dare you speak bad of the loving Antifa, who are running around stabbing and shooting and bombing people.
[03:48:57.334 --> 03:48:58.295]  Oh my gosh.
[03:48:59.215 --> 03:49:03.017]  They incite violence against Trump supporters.
[03:49:03.017 --> 03:49:03.617]  Look at that!
[03:49:03.617 --> 03:49:05.939]  Wow!
[03:49:05.939 --> 03:49:08.340]  I mean, she looks like you just killed her baby.
[03:49:08.340 --> 03:49:10.481]  Yeah.
[03:49:10.481 --> 03:49:11.261]  That is evil.
[03:49:11.261 --> 03:49:12.662]  That is the look of an evil person.
[03:49:12.662 --> 03:49:14.823]  Why couldn't she just come over and argue with you?
[03:49:14.823 --> 03:49:17.585]  Yeah, that's a satanic look.
[03:49:17.585 --> 03:49:20.546]  I mean, you can look at that person and just tell that as a sociopath.
[03:49:24.676 --> 03:49:31.482]  Yeah, she's a Damien, like a Damien creature you're waiting for some... Your mother sucks, you know what in hell.
[03:49:31.482 --> 03:49:32.644]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:49:32.644 --> 03:49:36.267]  And that's what they go, but they laughed.
[03:49:36.267 --> 03:49:39.290]  They laughed when I brought up political violence against Trump supporters.
[03:49:39.290 --> 03:49:40.691]  They incited Alex.
[03:49:40.691 --> 03:49:41.352]  They want us.
[03:49:41.932 --> 03:49:43.612]  Women get pepper sprayed for them?
[03:49:43.612 --> 03:49:47.133]  I honestly believe that is their form of pornography.
[03:49:47.133 --> 03:49:48.233]  Well, sure, women getting hurt.
[03:49:48.233 --> 03:49:50.334]  That's why they would pay women to go get hurt at Trump rallies.
[03:49:50.334 --> 03:49:51.154]  Their own people beat them up.
[03:49:51.154 --> 03:49:51.994]  That came out in WikiLeaks.
[03:49:51.994 --> 03:49:56.515]  We first broke that from the Chicago PD and then it all turned out to be accurate from our local affiliate.
[03:49:56.515 --> 03:49:57.955]  Had contact with the Chicago PD.
[03:49:57.955 --> 03:49:59.075]  Was there with his kids.
[03:49:59.075 --> 03:50:01.716]  The Chicago PD letter said, no, they were brought here by Hillary.
[03:50:01.716 --> 03:50:04.036]  We have the documents and made to wear Bernie shirts.
[03:50:04.036 --> 03:50:07.037]  That way they took out Bernie and Trump at the same time, at least they thought.
[03:50:07.037 --> 03:50:08.937]  But expanding on that, we'll take a few more calls here.
[03:50:09.557 --> 03:50:21.651]  Can we get the video cut down of Colbert talking about Donald Trump and the fact that he is doing fellatio on Vladimir Putin?
[03:50:21.651 --> 03:50:23.513]  Because they called me anti-gay.
[03:50:24.554 --> 03:50:36.846]  When I said that Congressman Peter Schiff, the head of the House Intelligence Committee on the Democratic side, was sucking globalist wee-wee, and this is a family show, but I said that late at night, Colbert faces growing backlash.
[03:50:36.846 --> 03:50:38.408]  That's on DrudgeReport.com.
[03:50:38.408 --> 03:50:41.691]  I haven't really gotten into this a lot yet, but Fox News and all of it.
[03:50:41.691 --> 03:50:42.712]  Yeah, we can talk about that.
[03:50:42.712 --> 03:50:47.857]  Well, I want to talk about it because I'm not defending him because he's lied about me and my family and done some stuff, but here's the deal.
[03:50:49.059 --> 03:50:57.529]  I'm not saying it's okay, but when I said it, it was in the context of not being anti-anything, it was being he's subservient, like he's a brown-noser.
[03:50:57.529 --> 03:51:05.097]  And I think that's what he meant, lying about Trump, saying he's a Russian agent, you know, saying that Trump is a holster for Putin's wee-wee.
[03:51:05.097 --> 03:51:06.258]  I mean, what's your view on that?
[03:51:06.258 --> 03:51:09.142]  I think this is hyper-political correctness eating their own, Cernovich.
[03:51:09.775 --> 03:51:10.996]  Right, that's exactly right.
[03:51:10.996 --> 03:51:19.324]  So, the context is that if a man puts another man's member in his mouth, why is that degrading?
[03:51:19.324 --> 03:51:22.307]  Those are two adults, you know, why is that your insult?
[03:51:22.307 --> 03:51:27.071]  Your insult is, basically it means, the insult is you're a gay person.
[03:51:27.071 --> 03:51:29.113]  And that isn't what you intended to mean.
[03:51:29.113 --> 03:51:33.077]  It's just an expression that we all use, you know, at, you know, suck me off, you know.
[03:51:34.959 --> 03:51:36.861]  It's meaning that he's his boy.
[03:51:36.861 --> 03:51:38.442]  He's serving him.
[03:51:38.442 --> 03:51:39.864]  I mean, it doesn't mean anything.
[03:51:39.864 --> 03:51:51.056]  It's a figure of speech that's not... but again, they always want to expand what's hateful, where I have a right to be hateful if I want, but I'm not being, and then they turn it into, now even Colbert is being destroyed by this.
[03:51:51.974 --> 03:52:03.607]  Which is great because I was one of the people who led the campaign actually when it happened because I remember they went after you for that Adam Schiff comment and I go, hey, we're going to apply.
[03:52:03.607 --> 03:52:10.955]  People have called me a Saul Alinsky to the right because I say, hey, if you're going to go after Alex Jones like that, we're going to hold Colbert.
[03:52:11.556 --> 03:52:13.798]  To the same standard you're going to hold us to.
[03:52:13.798 --> 03:52:16.700]  And so I actually got people calling CBS.
[03:52:16.700 --> 03:52:22.305]  I let a big campaign ride when I saw it because I immediately go, wait, I remember what they did with Alex.
[03:52:22.305 --> 03:52:23.526]  Here's what I want.
[03:52:23.526 --> 03:52:26.628]  Fair, equal treatment, the same rules.
[03:52:26.628 --> 03:52:30.471]  So if they're going to go after you for doing it, then I said, we're going to go after Colbert.
[03:52:30.471 --> 03:52:34.174]  So I'm actually the person who initiated that attack on Colbert.
[03:52:34.174 --> 03:52:34.715]  Oh, really?
[03:52:34.715 --> 03:52:35.355]  I didn't even know that.
[03:52:35.355 --> 03:52:36.316]  There you go again, sir.
[03:52:36.316 --> 03:52:38.158]  In fact, wasn't the hashtag fire Colbert?
[03:52:38.973 --> 03:52:39.874]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[03:52:39.874 --> 03:52:43.820]  So I didn't start that specific hashtag, but I started the meme.
[03:52:43.820 --> 03:52:47.925]  I started the meme right when it happened, because right when I saw Colbert do that on TV.
[03:52:47.925 --> 03:52:51.190]  And we could call for his firing because he's a hypocrite, he deserves it.
[03:52:51.190 --> 03:52:53.172]  We're not saying we even agree with the political correctness.
[03:52:53.172 --> 03:52:53.973]  We're simply saying...
[03:52:54.594 --> 03:52:58.916]  This is a modern way, just like you see Robert De Niro in so many movies.
[03:52:58.916 --> 03:53:07.779]  If somebody screws somebody over, or somebody's a weasel, you say, that bleeping, bleeping sucker is nothing to do with gay people.
[03:53:07.779 --> 03:53:11.040]  It's saying, this person is subservient.
[03:53:11.040 --> 03:53:14.401]  It's the same thing as saying, butt kisser, when I say that.
[03:53:14.401 --> 03:53:15.222]  I mean, don't you agree?
[03:53:15.222 --> 03:53:16.102]  That's how I mean it!
[03:53:17.096 --> 03:53:26.915]  Right, and that's the first time, right when I saw the Daily Beast headline, that's when I go, oh, homophobia and sexual harassment is okay when the left does it.
[03:53:26.915 --> 03:53:28.638]  Let's pull his Twitter up so we can show people the HD.
[03:53:29.833 --> 03:53:30.413]  Absolutely.
[03:53:30.413 --> 03:53:34.336]  Yes, I can text this tweet here to the production guys.
[03:53:34.336 --> 03:53:40.039]  So yeah, that was the whole point is right when I saw that I go, I go, okay, we're going to hold them to the same rule.
[03:53:40.039 --> 03:53:50.046]  And then what it turned out actually, that he Colbert had said the same thing a year ago, they go Colbert, if you have one question for Trump, what would it be?
[03:53:50.046 --> 03:53:54.748]  And they go, I would ask Trump, how does Putin's you know what taste?
[03:53:54.748 --> 03:53:56.790]  So Colbert has now said this twice.
[03:53:57.748 --> 03:54:03.295]  Now, so if it's wrong when you do it, fine, then they better play by the same rules.
[03:54:03.295 --> 03:54:09.343]  In fact, Google Alex Jones' homophobic rant about Congressman Schiff, and I said the exact same thing.
[03:54:10.222 --> 03:54:11.343]  Right, exactly.
[03:54:11.343 --> 03:54:18.926]  So, in my world, and this is why conservatives lose all the time, in a perfect world... We always apologize and back down.
[03:54:18.926 --> 03:54:19.446]  Yeah.
[03:54:19.446 --> 03:54:22.648]  In a perfect world, let's just go, you know, give everybody breathing room.
[03:54:22.648 --> 03:54:26.770]  We shouldn't hold people accountable for a few, you know, loose things here and there.
[03:54:26.770 --> 03:54:32.092]  But, if the left is going to go after us, then I'm not going to say, oh, I'm going to take the high road, Namaste.
[03:54:32.092 --> 03:54:34.093]  No, let's use their own weapons against them.
[03:54:34.093 --> 03:54:34.893]  Exactly.
[03:54:34.893 --> 03:54:36.134]  That is how you lose.
[03:54:36.134 --> 03:54:37.795]  You lose by letting the enemy...
[03:54:39.938 --> 03:54:41.899]  Folks, you can follow me at RealAlexJones on Twitter.
[03:54:41.899 --> 03:54:44.100]  You can follow Paul Watson at Prison Planet.
[03:54:44.100 --> 03:54:46.442]  You can follow Cernovich at Cernovich.
[03:54:46.442 --> 03:54:47.162]  They try to censor us.
[03:54:47.162 --> 03:54:47.682]  They try to blog us.
[03:54:47.682 --> 03:54:48.683]  We don't have fake Twitter followers.
[03:54:48.683 --> 03:54:49.523]  We have real people.
[03:54:49.523 --> 03:54:50.184]  Please retweet us.
[03:54:50.184 --> 03:54:51.584]  Please follow us all.
[03:54:51.584 --> 03:54:52.925]  Please retweet.
[03:54:52.925 --> 03:54:54.386]  I've challenged Colbert to debate me.
[03:54:54.386 --> 03:54:59.088]  He'd rather just lie about who I am and pose as if he's a news reporter doing these comedy pieces, but it's fine.
[03:54:59.088 --> 03:55:00.189]  He does have an audience.
[03:55:00.189 --> 03:55:01.529]  Our audience is swelling.
[03:55:01.529 --> 03:55:04.871]  They don't get the fact that people come to us and find the truth.
[03:55:04.871 --> 03:55:06.832]  These attacks only send people to us.
[03:55:06.832 --> 03:55:08.893]  I want to go to Eileen in California briefly, but
[03:55:09.393 --> 03:55:14.279]  In a moment, but please, we're running huge specials at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:55:14.279 --> 03:55:18.484]  We have to make back money since Google banned us advertising through AdRoll.
[03:55:18.484 --> 03:55:20.746]  We lost all our extra budget for this year.
[03:55:20.746 --> 03:55:21.888]  We really want to expand.
[03:55:21.888 --> 03:55:24.831]  We don't want to just back down and big fish eat little fish.
[03:55:24.831 --> 03:55:26.233]  We're either going to expand or we're going to implode.
[03:55:26.593 --> 03:55:26.873]  That's right.
[03:55:45.221 --> 03:55:46.802]  Can I say something real quick Alex?
[03:56:09.693 --> 03:56:20.779]  You know, I just want to tell the people listening in that when I went and toured the compound, there's, whatever they think of Infowars now, I saw you're going to double your studio, right?
[03:56:20.779 --> 03:56:25.242]  You can show the people, actually, the big green screens, the rooms that aren't being used.
[03:56:25.242 --> 03:56:28.904]  So this isn't some kind of thing like, oh, you know, we're trying to expand.
[03:56:28.904 --> 03:56:34.226]  I saw it in real life because I wanted to bring my daughter, actually, and, you know, to meet you and everything there in the studio.
[03:56:34.226 --> 03:56:36.448]  And I wanted to bring Shauna, my wonderful, intelligent wife.
[03:56:37.208 --> 03:56:44.094]  And actually they told me no no there's dust because we're doing so much construction non-stop it would be bad for the baby.
[03:56:44.094 --> 03:56:52.021]  Absolutely there's a lot of insulation and stuff this is not that old of a building but still the dust isn't good it's been really making me sneeze and yeah you saw it there's a whole new studio twice the size
[03:56:52.742 --> 03:56:55.144]  No, it's one and a half times.
[03:56:55.144 --> 03:56:56.685]  No, it's almost twice the size.
[03:56:56.685 --> 03:56:57.765]  The ceilings are higher.
[03:56:57.765 --> 03:56:58.846]  Huge studio getting built.
[03:56:58.846 --> 03:57:00.447]  Even more state of the art than this.
[03:57:00.447 --> 03:57:03.029]  Other radio studios being put in to fire up.
[03:57:03.029 --> 03:57:04.169]  I'm going to work with GCN.
[03:57:04.169 --> 03:57:06.411]  You know, Ted's a great guy if he wants to.
[03:57:06.411 --> 03:57:08.352]  But I'm planning to have stuff from like 5 a.m.
[03:57:08.352 --> 03:57:10.894]  in the morning right through to basically midnight.
[03:57:11.394 --> 03:57:17.497]  And we're going to have roundtable shows, high-energy calls, video, articles, breaking news.
[03:57:17.497 --> 03:57:20.358]  And, you know, Cernovich can do three hours a day every once or one hour.
[03:57:20.358 --> 03:57:23.439]  But it's going to be your show, however you want to model it.
[03:57:23.439 --> 03:57:25.820]  I'm getting more crew hired the next month.
[03:57:25.820 --> 03:57:28.861]  So in about the next month and a half, we're going to start launching more shows.
[03:57:28.861 --> 03:57:30.022]  And you're going to see Mike Cernovich.
[03:57:30.022 --> 03:57:32.263]  You're going to see a bunch of other people from all over the country.
[03:57:32.263 --> 03:57:35.124]  You've got to send them better, obviously, better microphones, equipment, acoustics.
[03:57:35.124 --> 03:57:38.025]  I'll probably pay wherever he lives to put in maybe a sound booth or something.
[03:57:38.025 --> 03:57:39.626]  And I'm going to send the equipment to all the hosts.
[03:57:40.006 --> 03:57:41.667]  Other people actually are already on local radios.
[03:57:41.667 --> 03:57:45.530]  We're going to simulcast with them, and I'm going to fire up and go in the face of them.
[03:57:45.530 --> 03:57:49.333]  I was only going to add one or two other shows, but when they try to shut me down, I'm just going to expand.
[03:57:49.333 --> 03:57:50.374]  Don't you think that's the answer, Mike?
[03:57:51.291 --> 03:57:59.637]  Yeah, actually, when they go after me harder, and we talked about this actually in Austin, is my answer to that is I'm going to double down.
[03:57:59.637 --> 03:58:01.018]  You're going to try to bankrupt me.
[03:58:01.018 --> 03:58:03.379]  You're going to try to destroy my life and reputation.
[03:58:03.379 --> 03:58:08.763]  All that does is make me more excited, and I'm going to go even harder.
[03:58:08.763 --> 03:58:14.107]  I've always told them, and you're the same way, is if they want to get rid of us, they should just be nice to us.
[03:58:14.867 --> 03:58:17.109]  But the more they attack, the harder we fight.
[03:58:17.109 --> 03:58:17.629]  Exactly.
[03:58:17.629 --> 03:58:18.470]  All right.
[03:58:18.470 --> 03:58:22.753]  If you want to go to Eileen, who's a great lady, I'm sure Glenn and Jesse and Michael and Wylde, you can.
[03:58:22.753 --> 03:58:23.894]  I know you got a lot to break.
[03:58:23.894 --> 03:58:24.494]  Huge stuff.
[03:58:24.494 --> 03:58:26.536]  If you want to bam, bam, bam, take those, it's up to you.
[03:58:26.536 --> 03:58:30.919]  Sarnovich and Leanne McAdoo and others are back here in just a few minutes.
[03:58:30.919 --> 03:58:33.041]  Of course, they're in a different studio, so we'll see if this can happen.
[03:58:33.041 --> 03:58:35.122]  But regardless, I'll be back tonight, 7 o'clock.
[03:58:35.122 --> 03:58:36.603]  30-hour broadcast.
[03:58:36.603 --> 03:58:37.204]  Spread the link.
