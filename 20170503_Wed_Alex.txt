[00:00.000 --> 00:16.800]  It's time for the big kickoff of the 30-hour global transmission against tyranny in defense
[00:16.800 --> 00:18.800]  of free speech and the West.
[00:18.800 --> 00:25.080]  It's 11 a.m. Central Standard Time on the M4 Wars News Centers in Austin, Texas.
[00:25.080 --> 00:32.080]  On Wednesday, May 3rd, 2017, start your engines and get ready to rumble.
[00:32.080 --> 00:34.080]  We are the resistance.
[00:34.080 --> 00:38.080]  We stand against globalism and worldwide unelected corporate tyranny.
[00:38.080 --> 00:41.080]  We stand for free market capitalism.
[00:41.080 --> 00:43.080]  We stand for religious freedom.
[00:43.080 --> 00:44.080]  We stand for sovereignty.
[00:44.080 --> 00:46.080]  We stand for the family.
[00:46.080 --> 00:48.080]  We stand for the individual right to self-defense.
[00:48.080 --> 00:54.080]  We stand in defense of the Renaissance and the West as it is under massive globalist sustained siege.
[00:54.080 --> 00:56.080]  We are the info war.
[00:56.080 --> 00:59.080]  We are the resistance.
[00:59.080 --> 01:01.080]  We stand for the resistance.
[01:01.080 --> 01:03.080]  Wednesday.
[01:03.080 --> 01:13.080]  On the third day of May 2017, as the enemy media attacks us at record levels, it's only intensifying.
[01:13.080 --> 01:15.080]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:15.080 --> 01:18.080]  We'll be here for the next 30 hours.
[01:18.080 --> 01:25.080]  In fact, I left my list in my little office over there of all the guest hosts and all the guests that are going to be joining us.
[01:25.080 --> 01:34.080]  Coming up in just the next few hours, Dr. Ron Paul, Dr. Jerome Corsi with huge breaking news, Dr. Edward Group, Catherine Austin Fitz,
[01:34.080 --> 01:41.080]  banking expert from the Clinton administration, Mike Cernovich, and so much more today.
[01:41.080 --> 01:43.080]  I'll be going over the big list.
[01:43.080 --> 01:50.080]  Infowars.com forward slash show has the 30 hour feed that we just kicked off a minute and a half ago.
[01:50.080 --> 01:54.080]  You can also share that feed info wars.com forward slash show.
[01:54.080 --> 02:01.080]  That's what this is really all about is defeating their technocracy, defeating their bots, defeating their computers.
[02:01.080 --> 02:03.080]  They claim that we've got Russian bots.
[02:03.080 --> 02:05.080]  What a load of malarkey.
[02:05.080 --> 02:10.080]  We have the American people and the people of the world that want to expose globalism.
[02:10.080 --> 02:14.080]  We've got this to say, Trump is really going off his trajectory more and more.
[02:14.080 --> 02:15.080]  Even Limbaugh came out.
[02:15.080 --> 02:22.080]  I'm going to play the clip coming up and said, we sent you to drain the swamp.
[02:22.080 --> 02:27.080]  And you're not quite doing that with this new spending bill and a few other things you're doing.
[02:27.080 --> 02:28.080]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:28.080 --> 02:33.080]  Trump is draining the swamp, but it's like it's a video game.
[02:33.080 --> 02:39.080]  He's like fighting the big crime boss at the end of the level.
[02:39.080 --> 02:42.080]  The power level of the boss is going down.
[02:42.080 --> 02:47.080]  But as Trump battles the globalist, he's looking into the eyes of the devil.
[02:47.080 --> 02:50.080]  He is slowly becoming them.
[02:50.080 --> 02:52.080]  So he's doing all these great things.
[02:52.080 --> 02:55.080]  But at first he was 100% the first 30 days.
[02:55.080 --> 02:58.080]  And then 60 days later it was at 98%.
[02:58.080 --> 03:00.080]  Then 70 days later it was at 95%.
[03:00.080 --> 03:02.080]  And then now he's at like 70%.
[03:02.080 --> 03:05.080]  Hell, he was at like 80% a few days ago.
[03:05.080 --> 03:07.080]  Trump is unraveling quickly.
[03:07.080 --> 03:09.080]  I will just tell you that.
[03:09.080 --> 03:11.080]  And I think everybody can see it.
[03:11.080 --> 03:13.080]  Now he wouldn't have done all the things he did if he wasn't for real.
[03:13.080 --> 03:15.080]  These are devastating blows.
[03:15.080 --> 03:17.080]  Devastating blows against the globalists.
[03:17.080 --> 03:19.080]  These are real things.
[03:19.080 --> 03:25.080]  Declaring sovereignty, getting big banks to loan to small businesses, killing TPP,
[03:25.080 --> 03:29.080]  making better trade deals with China, Mexico, beginning to build the wall.
[03:29.080 --> 03:31.080]  Email the funding is not there.
[03:31.080 --> 03:35.080]  But not killing Obamacare when they had the conservative votes.
[03:35.080 --> 03:38.080]  Bringing up that watered down version.
[03:38.080 --> 03:42.080]  Well, it wasn't as bad as Obamacare but wasn't what he promised.
[03:42.080 --> 03:45.080]  This new spending bill that doesn't have the money for the wall
[03:45.080 --> 03:47.080]  and increases much democratic programs.
[03:47.080 --> 03:49.080]  I understand he's got to compromise.
[03:49.080 --> 03:51.080]  I understand they want to shut down the government and blame him.
[03:51.080 --> 03:54.080]  I get what Trump's doing.
[03:54.080 --> 04:00.080]  But the purest vision of Trump and Stephen Bannon,
[04:00.080 --> 04:04.080]  since Bannon 72 days ago, or 72 days in,
[04:04.080 --> 04:07.080]  36 days ago or so, or whatever it was,
[04:07.080 --> 04:12.080]  70-something days in when Bannon got demoted, he really got demoted.
[04:12.080 --> 04:15.080]  And you can really see that behind the scenes with his whiteboard
[04:15.080 --> 04:18.080]  that had all their goals and all their ideas and all their strategies.
[04:18.080 --> 04:22.080]  It's now gotten leaked because he posed with a staffer in front of the whiteboard
[04:22.080 --> 04:23.080]  not meaning for it to get out.
[04:23.080 --> 04:24.080]  That's how in the news today.
[04:24.080 --> 04:27.080]  You look at what's on that whiteboard, that's what they did.
[04:27.080 --> 04:30.080]  In just 70 days, Trump over delivered.
[04:30.080 --> 04:31.080]  It was beautiful.
[04:31.080 --> 04:35.080]  Now that story's up on DrudgeReport.com. Bannon planning whiteboard
[04:35.080 --> 04:36.080]  accidentally reveal.
[04:36.080 --> 04:40.080]  Let's tweet that out right now at Real Alex Jones so people can see that image.
[04:40.080 --> 04:42.080]  It's out of the telegraph today.
[04:42.080 --> 04:45.080]  So it's all coming up.
[04:45.080 --> 04:47.080]  They want to try to censor M4s.
[04:47.080 --> 04:48.080]  They want to try to block us on Google.
[04:48.080 --> 04:49.080]  They want to try to do all this.
[04:49.080 --> 04:52.080]  They can't stop you spreading the articles, the videos.
[04:52.080 --> 04:56.080]  They can't stop you spreading the word about local M&F stations.
[04:56.080 --> 04:57.080]  Get ready.
[04:57.080 --> 05:02.080]  We've got so much news to cover on North Korea, the economy, the Hillary Clinton,
[05:02.080 --> 05:28.080]  the FBI, director testifying and so much more.
[06:02.080 --> 06:04.080]  Get more information at infowars.com.
[06:04.080 --> 06:33.080]  I'm David Knight.
[06:34.080 --> 06:53.080]  I'm David Knight.
[06:53.080 --> 07:03.080]  I'm David Knight.
[07:03.080 --> 07:04.080]  I'm David Knight.
[07:33.080 --> 07:34.080]  I'm David Knight.
[08:03.080 --> 08:05.080]  I'm David Knight.
[08:05.080 --> 08:27.300]  We came, you saw, you died.
[08:27.300 --> 08:31.440]  We came, you saw, you died.
[08:31.440 --> 08:37.440]  We came, you saw, you died.
[08:37.440 --> 08:47.440]  We came, you saw, you died.
[08:47.440 --> 09:03.440]  We came, you saw, you died.
[09:03.440 --> 09:13.440]  We came, you saw, you died.
[09:13.440 --> 09:23.440]  We came, you saw, you died.
[09:23.440 --> 09:33.440]  We came, you saw, you died.
[09:33.440 --> 09:57.440]  We came, you saw, you died.
[09:57.440 --> 10:05.440]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[10:05.440 --> 10:15.440]  Occasionally we have to bring the Gorgon back from her crypt to just remind everybody the Medusa-like creature that we dodged last year on November 8th.
[10:15.440 --> 10:22.440]  Does that mean Donald Trump's perfect? Absolutely not. Does that mean we won't hold his feet to the fire? Absolutely we will.
[10:22.440 --> 10:28.440]  But Trump's done a lot of good. He's also starting to do some pretty bad stuff. And I expected this earlier, actually.
[10:28.440 --> 10:34.440]  I said if he got 30-40% done when he claimed he did, that he'd be legendary. He's already pretty much gotten that done.
[10:34.440 --> 10:46.440]  He's gotten so much done. But it's still sad and quite frankly even more painful to try to figure out how he could be so good and do so much good for the average person
[10:46.440 --> 10:55.440]  and for national sovereignty and so much to expose political correctness and the United Nations and globalism and then start going sideways.
[10:55.440 --> 11:03.440]  It makes it even worse at a cellular gut level, doesn't it?
[11:03.440 --> 11:12.440]  I kicked off today with Hillary Clinton because she's all over the news, obviously, blaming Comey that she didn't win.
[11:12.440 --> 11:17.440]  Comey completely covered up Hillary's crimes and did nothing to stop her.
[11:17.440 --> 11:24.440]  When she openly had 30-something thousand illegal emails on the legal server and got money from the Russians and the Chinese, I mean, it's a joke.
[11:24.440 --> 11:33.440]  The Clinton's had been protected for 30-plus years. And then she turns around and says she lost because of Comey.
[11:33.440 --> 11:39.440]  She almost won because of Comey and Loretta Lynch and all the rest of it.
[11:39.440 --> 11:45.440]  And then she says in interviews yesterday that she lost because she was a woman.
[11:45.440 --> 11:49.440]  I thought she was going to win because she was a woman. It had nothing to do with it.
[11:49.440 --> 11:59.440]  Men are overwhelmingly reportedly going to vote for Le Pen in France because they like her policies of sovereignty and French culture and lower taxes.
[11:59.440 --> 12:12.440]  Comey's testifying before the Senate's discerning committee right now will be breaking down some of the highlights of that as it unfolds here today at 1212 Eastern, 1112 Central.
[12:12.440 --> 12:20.440]  But also, Comey has now said that classified Clinton emails were forwarded to Anthony Weiner and Uma Abadine, which we already knew and reported last year.
[12:20.440 --> 12:27.440]  But here it is. New Uma Abadine emails revealed 29 previously undisclosed Clinton emails with classified information.
[12:27.440 --> 12:33.440]  Hillary said first her emails were never hacked. Then she said there was no classified info. Liar, liar.
[12:33.440 --> 12:45.440]  But it's okay. As long as she wears a Mao Zedong, you know, Chinese style communist outfit like she always does and walks around with her Islamic girlfriend, everything's fine.
[12:45.440 --> 12:54.440]  Hillary Clinton, I was on the way to winning until Comey and Russian WikiLeaks. Yes. Yes, the Russians released your crimes.
[12:54.440 --> 12:59.440]  The Russians weren't the WikiLeaks people on that. It was the CIA. It was the Pentagon. Everybody knows that.
[12:59.440 --> 13:06.440]  It was U.S. leakers. British ambassadors have gone public. Our sources have gone public about the fact that they know the sources.
[13:06.440 --> 13:21.440]  But it's the Russians. They're the reason we didn't want an old, evil, twisted maven of corruption and oppression and evil who cackles like a witch.
[13:21.440 --> 13:25.440]  So let's go ahead and start going through some of these clips.
[13:25.440 --> 13:41.440]  Here's Hillary Clinton includes herself as part of the resistance. Ever since they lost in November of last year, seven months ago, they have been calling themselves the resistance.
[13:41.440 --> 13:47.440]  I'm Stephen Colbert. And if you're watching this transmission, you are the resistance.
[13:47.440 --> 13:58.440]  I'm Keith Oberman, Russian scum, Russian scum. By the way, I'm Keith Oberman. I'm the resistance against the Russian takeover.
[13:58.440 --> 14:05.440]  That's what the establishment calls themselves is the resistance now because they're the globalists that have hijacked the government taken over.
[14:05.440 --> 14:11.440]  Trump was a beachhead of the resistance, a manifestation of how strong the nationalistic awakening is.
[14:11.440 --> 14:36.440]  Whether he is totally real, goes sideways or turns on us, which I don't think you'll do, doesn't matter in the final equation because we've gone from being obscure in the closet, demonized, the redheaded stepchild to the paramount, fastest growing global movement in the world against unelected worldwide tyranny known as globalism.
[14:36.440 --> 14:47.440]  So think about how the Federal Reserve is exposed, how they've got to have a Federal Reserve of New York board members sue me with the law firm started by George Soros. Can't make that up.
[14:47.440 --> 14:58.440]  Oh, they're not laughing now at Nigel Farage or Marie Le Pen or Ron Paul or Alex Jones or Matt Drudge.
[14:58.440 --> 15:11.440]  And it's the Matt Drudges and the Alex Joneses and the Jerome Corsies and the Pat Buchanan's. We're not giving credit here. We're scientifically historically laying out and where we came from nothing.
[15:11.440 --> 15:23.440]  But with the truth, going back to Barry Goldwater and Phyllis Schlafly, 60, 70 years ago, Phyllis Schlafly just died a month or so ago at what, 90 something years old.
[15:23.440 --> 15:37.440]  She was fighting when she was 25 years old as a young law graduate. Talk about breaking the glass ceilings. That lady did it and then led the Americana movement after Barry Goldwater's death.
[15:37.440 --> 15:48.440]  So we stand on their shoulders. They were the first wave in the modern wave of reawakening. Then the Ron Pauls and the Ronald Reagan's were the second wave. Didn't mean they were perfect, but they were the opposition to globalism.
[15:48.440 --> 15:57.440]  The flame alive showed what real prosperity was in free market. Then you come into the third wave, Matt Drudge, Alex Jones.
[15:57.440 --> 16:11.440]  And then you come into the fourth wave, Le Pen. His dad was first wave. She's in the third wave and Donald Trump's.
[16:11.440 --> 16:20.440]  He's in Nigel Farage's. He's been around 20 something years, but he really peaked now in this third wave. And then the fourth wave.
[16:20.440 --> 16:31.440]  It's a very, very, very exciting time to be part of this, ladies and gentlemen. I sat around as a child and heard my dad and his friends talk about everything that later happened.
[16:31.440 --> 16:38.440]  And how we should form a resistance against it and get the truth out because a tyranny like this would never succeed if we were there exposing it. And it happened.
[16:38.440 --> 16:49.440]  Now, Hillary has the nerve to call herself the resistance. I guess they are the globalist resistance to humanity awakening. Here's Hillary.
[16:49.440 --> 17:01.440]  I can't be anything other than who I am. And I spent decades learning about what it would take to move our country forward, including people who, you know, clearly didn't vote for me.
[17:01.440 --> 17:18.440]  To try to make sure that we dealt with a lot of these hard issues that are right around the corner, like robotics and artificial intelligence and things that are really going to be upending the economy for the vast majority of Americans to say nothing of the rest of the world.
[17:18.440 --> 17:27.440]  So, you know, I'm now back to being an activist citizen and part of the resistance.
[17:27.440 --> 17:38.440]  Hey, the globalists have decided to build a future where people aren't needed. They've written the white papers, the books. It's all out there. We're ugly. We're bad. Kill the public. Get the freeway moving.
[17:38.440 --> 17:59.440]  Allah Bill Maher. Allah Bill Nye, the science guy. Don't have more than one kid. Have a superstate that controls you. And then Hillary, who's given awards to China, been part of the UN Women's Group, who pushes the robotics replacing us, who pushes a system of not having a future for humanity,
[17:59.440 --> 18:11.440]  of cutting our resources off. Her and Bill Gates and others are now warning you about the technocracy that's about to make you obsolete because the technocrats have decided to do that.
[18:11.440 --> 18:23.440]  If we keep voting with our dollars and don't go along with these systems and don't go along with the smart homes and don't go along with the surveillance grid and don't go along with the Amazons of the world, the amazon.coms,
[18:23.440 --> 18:35.440]  then their program is dead on arrival. That's why globalism is falling right now. And they're pivoting, trying to act like they're the anti-globalists in some cases, to try to somehow control the opposition.
[18:35.440 --> 18:47.440]  And some people could argue that's what President Trump is. Trump believed in it. He believes in America. He wants it. But he's got people in there trying to co-opt him right now.
[18:47.440 --> 18:54.440]  And I'm not lionizing Trump saying he's perfect. He wouldn't have done the things he did if he wasn't for real. They were coffin nails to this.
[18:54.440 --> 19:05.440]  But his course, 35 days ago when Bannon got demoted, basically sidelined, has started going off to the side and it's deteriorating quickly.
[19:05.440 --> 19:12.440]  So we're going to play clips of Limbaugh saying, hey, drain the swamp. When Vice President Pence was on yesterday, we've got a bunch of other clips.
[19:12.440 --> 19:20.440]  We've got Joe Biden saying Hillary lost because she's a woman. Record numbers of women voted for Donald Trump and you know that.
[19:20.440 --> 19:27.440]  This has nothing to do with what is between somebody's legs. It's what's between their ears.
[19:27.440 --> 19:38.440]  And it shows the arrogance and the bravada and the hubris of the elite to try to sell a drugged out evil crone with all of her evil record on the American people.
[19:38.440 --> 19:47.440]  We've got to sell Bush. Jeb Bush was the number one guy in the Republican establishment, Bush. Don't you get it? We don't want these operatives anymore.
[19:47.440 --> 19:56.440]  And if Trump isn't perfect, doesn't matter, we still went for the package labeled patriot, labeled renaissance, labeled nationalism.
[19:56.440 --> 20:01.440]  And it shows the awakening and it's a very positive thing in a very, very negative world.
[20:01.440 --> 20:05.440]  We'll be back. The 30 hour special transmission has now launched.
[20:05.440 --> 20:15.440]  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon you'll need a plan and place to survive. Forget bunkers. You're not a live underground gopher.
[20:15.440 --> 20:24.440]  You need survivalist camps, the ultimate fully functional off the grid mobile survival bug outhouse that's well equipped and custom built to outlast any other RV or trailer.
[20:24.440 --> 20:31.440]  Bold statement, you bet. See him now at survivalistcamps.com. That's survivalistcamps.com.
[20:31.440 --> 20:35.440]  Trust your family survival to survivalistcamps.com.
[21:02.440 --> 21:14.440]  Today we call it Bone Broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diet, a processed junk.
[21:14.440 --> 21:27.440]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfoWarsLive.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[21:27.440 --> 21:35.440]  Caveman, it's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture them.
[21:35.440 --> 21:43.440]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal. You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[21:43.440 --> 21:51.440]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[21:51.440 --> 21:59.440]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it.

[24:07.440 --> 24:12.440]  It wasn't a perfect campaign. There is no such thing.
[24:12.440 --> 24:28.440]  But I was on the way to winning until the combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me but got scared off.
[24:28.440 --> 24:39.440]  And the evidence for that intervening event is, I think, compelling, persuasive.
[24:39.440 --> 24:48.440]  And so we overcame a lot in the campaign. We overcame an enormous barrage of negativity.
[24:48.440 --> 24:58.440]  We overcame an enormous barrage of negativity.
[24:58.440 --> 25:08.440]  We overcame an enormous barrage of negativity.
[25:08.440 --> 25:19.440]  That was planted in my brain, still remains within the cell.
[25:19.440 --> 25:24.440]  Thank you so much for joining us today during the 30 hour global transmission. We just kicked off.
[25:24.440 --> 25:31.440]  What an incredible sore loser we just witnessed in Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[25:31.440 --> 25:39.440]  They were rigging the debates. They were rigging the questions. They were manipulating the media. It's in thousands of the WikiLeaks.
[25:39.440 --> 25:45.440]  They were trying to keep us desperate in the dark, needing them.
[25:45.440 --> 25:50.440]  They were doing all of this. They had the whole system fixed. They were trying to steal the election.
[25:50.440 --> 25:58.440]  They didn't at least five states, massive evidence of that, tried to break into computers and six others, but they failed.
[25:58.440 --> 26:05.440]  They had polls on average, adding 15 points more to Hillary, so that she looked like a winner.
[26:05.440 --> 26:17.440]  CNN in some polls added over 30%. Trump won in a giant landslide.
[26:17.440 --> 26:29.440]  Let's just remember, as we see Trump begin to waffle some, that we should hold his feet to the fire and be very, very aggressive about it.
[26:29.440 --> 26:35.440]  But we had a victory in Trump, and we had a major victory in nationalism.
[26:35.440 --> 26:41.440]  Now, I've got some other Hillary Clinton clips I want to play, but coming up in the next segment, this is all over CNBC.
[26:41.440 --> 26:48.440]  It's all over the Wall Street Journal. It's all over the New York Times. Some of them even give us credit.
[26:48.440 --> 26:55.440]  Well, they want to say we're fake news because they're scared of us because they know we can force big stories out.
[26:55.440 --> 27:02.440]  One of Corsi's White House sources, and I don't even know his sources, but they're very good.
[27:02.440 --> 27:11.440]  Here it is from MarketWatch and Fox Business. Unention on Fannie and Freddie May funds used to pay for Obamacare. It's true.
[27:11.440 --> 27:17.440]  We broke this. This broke on May 1st two days ago.
[27:17.440 --> 27:20.440]  It's May 3rd today. Everybody started pointing this out to me yesterday.
[27:20.440 --> 27:25.440]  Did you know the news gave you credit? Here's Dr. Corsi's article from yesterday.
[27:25.440 --> 27:34.440]  Treasury Secretary confirms in FullWars.com reporting on Obama theft of Fannie and Freddie May, close to $300 billion we know of.
[27:34.440 --> 27:39.440]  That's just the documents that have been released from four years of Obama. They still haven't released the others.
[27:39.440 --> 27:45.440]  Corsi got these through lawsuits that the White House directed into by private companies.
[27:45.440 --> 27:53.440]  Here it is. Fannie, Freddie, profit payments should continue. Treasury says, oh, and here's the original article we put out.
[27:53.440 --> 27:57.440]  It's February 27th. That's two months ago.
[27:57.440 --> 28:06.440]  Exclusive Obama literally robbed Fannie and Freddie to fund Obamacare. Exclusive.
[28:06.440 --> 28:15.440]  Just like we told you last week that they had a big meeting on Friday morning at the White House with McMaster, the National Security Advisor,
[28:15.440 --> 28:25.440]  saying he wants to increase troops in Afghanistan and boost it up to $30 plus billion, and that all broke on Bloomberg on Monday.
[28:25.440 --> 28:30.440]  And the Soros Group put out its articles through Media Matters saying, find the leak and shut it down.
[28:30.440 --> 28:35.440]  And I got to correct something because I saw the show yesterday and I kind of conflate things not on purpose, but I talked fast.
[28:35.440 --> 28:38.440]  I got guests coming up. I mixed things together.
[28:38.440 --> 28:45.440]  Cernovich has a bunch of sources. I know that Don Jr. says he should be given the Pulitzer Prize. I agree he should.
[28:45.440 --> 28:48.440]  So should Paul Watson. Dr. Corsi and many others.
[28:48.440 --> 28:52.440]  If it was a real prize, give me it to globalist.
[28:52.440 --> 28:58.440]  And that he's a great source of info on what he says. He is not Cernovich's source.
[28:58.440 --> 29:03.440]  I happen to know one of the sources he has. It's in the White House. It's not Don Jr.
[29:03.440 --> 29:08.440]  who became a big investigation stop Don Jr. from leaking information. And I kind of conflated those two.
[29:08.440 --> 29:13.440]  My point is the two obviously like each other. I'll just leave it at that.
[29:13.440 --> 29:18.440]  That is not our source on much of this. And it's not our source on what happened in the Treasury Department.
[29:18.440 --> 29:23.440]  I can tell you that it's from the Treasury Department because this is known in the White House.
[29:23.440 --> 29:28.440]  The White House wants this stuff out and Fox News and CNN won't report it.
[29:28.440 --> 29:33.440]  So they give it to the big evil Alex Jones. The big evil Dr. Corsi.
[29:33.440 --> 29:36.440]  You know Corsi's got three number one New York Times seller books.
[29:36.440 --> 29:41.440]  He's probably changed the course of at least one election. Probably two with a Swiss boat book.
[29:41.440 --> 29:45.440]  And he's got a PhD in banking and is willing to expose all this.
[29:45.440 --> 30:05.440]  So another big giant story we broke that's coming up in Ron Paul. Stay with us.
[30:05.440 --> 30:12.440]  It was Thomas Jefferson who once said that our country is now taking so steady a course as to show by what road it will pass to destruction to wit.
[30:12.440 --> 30:16.440]  By consolidation of power first and then corruption. It's necessary consequence.
[30:16.440 --> 30:23.440]  Jefferson was warning us about the global elite. The 1% of the 1% consolidating the world's wealth and subverting the people's voice in government.
[30:23.440 --> 30:25.440]  Unfortunately, we didn't heed his advice.
[30:25.440 --> 30:31.440]  We now live in a neo feudalistic society in which we're treated as indentured servants who only exist to serve the needs of the establishment.
[30:31.440 --> 30:39.440]  Political office no longer represents the voice of the people but rather the initiation process politicians go through to gain acceptance into the aristocracy.
[30:39.440 --> 30:47.440]  Simply put, we the people are responsible for civilization and culture, yet we're suppressed by a tiny elite who have organized into criminal gangs that operate governments around the world.
[30:47.440 --> 30:55.440]  We falsely believe that everything is simply black and white, one extreme against the other, conservative versus liberal, but things will change once more of us realize this truth.
[30:55.440 --> 31:03.440]  As Thomas Jefferson also said, enlighten the people generally and tyranny and oppressions of the body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day.
[31:03.440 --> 31:05.440]  This is Kit Daniels within FullWars.com.

[34:37.440 --> 34:40.440]  Who is that voiceover man?
[34:40.440 --> 34:47.440]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[34:47.440 --> 35:05.440]  We're getting Dr. Jerome Corsi lined up on the Skype as we speak right now, investigative journalist, who broke a month ago that close to 300 billion just in the four years they were able to get into via our White House Treasury Connections, close to $300 billion.
[35:05.440 --> 35:15.440]  Now we have only gotten a portion of the documents, it's probably going to be a lot bigger and then Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary and others got asked about it on mainstream TV and they said no, it's true.
[35:15.440 --> 35:17.440]  Infowars is right.
[35:17.440 --> 35:21.440]  Well of course we're right, we got it from our sources.
[35:21.440 --> 35:25.440]  And Dr. Corsi has a Harvard degree in finance.
[35:25.440 --> 35:27.440]  He's worked with Donald Trump.
[35:27.440 --> 35:29.440]  He's an expert.
[35:29.440 --> 35:35.440]  That's why they hate us, in fact I've been told it's this story and bashing the radical Muslims that has them after me.
[35:35.440 --> 35:40.440]  They have the Federal Reserve of New York board member suing me right now.
[35:40.440 --> 35:53.440]  And I've been told stop getting into Fannie Mae Freddie Mac, stop getting into the Muslims back off, back off or you'll be destroyed.
[35:53.440 --> 36:03.440]  I'll tell you, it feels really good because it took him two months to get this stuff to break and Corsi probably wrote seven articles on this.
[36:03.440 --> 36:16.440]  And I'd call him, he's our Washington bureau head, he's hiring folks right now, we've got our offices in, just a block and a half away from the Capitol, overlooking the Capitol and no one else will report this, they're too scared.
[36:16.440 --> 36:30.440]  People are too scared to report that McMaster was in there and prevailed with Trump last Friday to up troops in Afghanistan and spend hundreds of billions of dollars over the next four years on it, it's crazy.
[36:30.440 --> 36:34.440]  But we broke it with Cernovich and it was announced on Monday.
[36:34.440 --> 36:44.440]  So that's why they're so upset with us, that's why they're so angry with us because we're going to tell you what's going on and we can't be bought off, we can't be intimidated.
[36:44.440 --> 37:00.440]  I'll tell you, it's very paradoxical, best of times, worst of times, that I just love Trump and what he's doing on the economy and Americana and sovereignty and battling ISIS and bringing jobs back, I just get chills.
[37:00.440 --> 37:02.440]  And then it makes it worse.
[37:02.440 --> 37:06.440]  Because if you already hate somebody, they do bad stuff, it doesn't really hurt you, you just fight them.
[37:06.440 --> 37:13.440]  But when you really care about somebody and you know what they're up against, you know they're getting threatened, you know they're surrounded, you know people aren't doing what he says.
[37:13.440 --> 37:20.440]  And then to see him start to capitulate and bring in globalists because they just weren't letting the government move.
[37:20.440 --> 37:25.440]  They had him in stalemate, they had him deadlocked.
[37:25.440 --> 37:35.440]  And so he's now dealing with them and getting us something but giving up something and people aren't going to put up with that, they expect stuff he can't deliver.
[37:35.440 --> 37:38.440]  Our listeners want me a lot, I'm going to tear into Trump.
[37:38.440 --> 37:42.440]  I'm just being a realist, I'm not endorsing what he's done.
[37:42.440 --> 37:47.440]  But I'm not as quick as even Limbaugh to start tearing into him because even Limbaugh's listeners are upset.
[37:47.440 --> 37:51.440]  Limbaugh's saying, hey, we hired you to drain the swamp, what are you doing?
[37:51.440 --> 37:53.440]  What are you doing with Paul Ryan?
[37:53.440 --> 37:58.440]  And it all started with 70, you know day 70 or so with that healthcare bill they went along with.
[37:58.440 --> 38:03.440]  So those videos are all up on infowords.com.
[38:03.440 --> 38:10.440]  I'm going to be playing some of those Limbaugh clips.
[38:10.440 --> 38:15.440]  Let's, you know, speak of the devil, let's go ahead and play a clip of Rush Limbaugh while we're getting Dr. Corsi on the line.
[38:15.440 --> 38:16.440]  Here it is.
[38:16.440 --> 38:20.440]  Why is the president now suggesting a budget shutdown in September or October?
[38:20.440 --> 38:23.440]  If it's no good now, why is it good then?
[38:23.440 --> 38:26.440]  You guys were sent there to drain the swamp.
[38:26.440 --> 38:29.440]  There's a clear Trump agenda that just isn't seeable.
[38:29.440 --> 38:39.440]  It's not visible in this budget and some people are getting concerned that there's more concern for bipartisanship and crossing the aisle working with Democrats.
[38:39.440 --> 38:53.440]  Then there is in draining the swamp and actually peeling away all of the roughage that is preventing actually moving forward here on so many of these issues that affect people domestically.
[38:53.440 --> 38:57.440]  Yeah, well I think people look at the efforts of the last 100 days.
[38:57.440 --> 39:01.440]  I was with the president in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Saturday.
[39:01.440 --> 39:06.440]  It took him an hour just to outline the highlights of the last 100 days.
[39:06.440 --> 39:12.440]  I mean, he signed more bills into law than any president in the first 100 days since Harry Truman.
[39:12.440 --> 39:19.440]  He's 13 different bills rolling back an avalanche of regulation and red tape on businesses across this country.
[39:19.440 --> 39:23.440]  500,000 jobs have been created since the first of the year.
[39:23.440 --> 39:25.440]  And you mentioned the Planned Parenthood issue.
[39:25.440 --> 39:27.440]  I know that's emerged.
[39:27.440 --> 39:36.440]  You know, the president recently signed a bill into law that ends the Obama era regulation that blocks states from banning Planned Parenthood funding.
[39:36.440 --> 39:41.440]  Now states can ban Planned Parenthood funding like we tried to do in the state of Indiana.
[39:41.440 --> 39:51.440]  And of course, the health care bill that we hope comes up soon actually defunds Planned Parenthood altogether while we repeal and replace Obamacare.
[39:51.440 --> 39:57.440]  I did hear that. I heard that this president is fighting every single day to advance his agenda.
[39:57.440 --> 40:01.440]  And I couldn't be more proud to be standing shoulder to shoulder with him.
[40:01.440 --> 40:09.440]  I agree with Pence. It's just a fact that he's going to have to make deals with the Democrats.
[40:09.440 --> 40:14.440]  Ali Paco, I really respect, has unendorsed him on some of the immigration issues.
[40:14.440 --> 40:26.440]  Trump was always going to reform immigration, but he's not going to let criminals and low recon quay stay anti-American Islamists, you name it, come in.
[40:26.440 --> 40:29.440]  But we killed half our kids with abortion in this country.
[40:29.440 --> 40:31.440]  We're going to have to replace the population.
[40:31.440 --> 40:35.440]  We need to do it with people that are integrated into the Americana system.
[40:35.440 --> 40:40.440]  And he's building the wall and he is, you know, going after people that are here illegally.
[40:40.440 --> 40:46.440]  But he's not what the media claimed he was, some racist that hates everybody.
[40:46.440 --> 40:54.440]  So, just like a lot of Christians, and I'm a Christian myself, got mad at him that he's not anti-gay once he got in.
[40:54.440 --> 40:56.440]  That was the media saying Trump was anti-gay.
[40:56.440 --> 40:59.440]  And so a lot of super right-wingers said, oh great, we love Trump.
[40:59.440 --> 41:07.440]  And I was like, hey guys, did you see the convention with Trump saying let's be inclusive to everybody?
[41:07.440 --> 41:10.440]  Trump's a big tent guy.
[41:10.440 --> 41:18.440]  And so that's the bottom line here is that we have a president for the whole country, not just for certain groups or for small subsections.
[41:18.440 --> 41:22.440]  Now, him wanting to go after Assange, absolutely terrible.
[41:22.440 --> 41:26.440]  He told Assange and others, if you've got more WikiLeaks, release him.
[41:26.440 --> 41:29.440]  You want to indict Assange President Trump? Indict yourself then.
[41:29.440 --> 41:32.440]  That's ridiculous. That's outrageous.
[41:32.440 --> 41:38.440]  And I know all the neocons and rhinos are pushing you for it, because then McCain will get off your back about Russia.
[41:38.440 --> 41:42.440]  He'll never get off your back. McCain funded the radical jihadis.
[41:42.440 --> 41:44.440]  McCain is the problem.
[41:44.440 --> 41:48.440]  You don't need to have him lead you around by the nose and have the tail wag the dog.
[41:48.440 --> 41:54.440]  Now we're going to Dr. Jerome Corsi here in just a moment.
[41:54.440 --> 42:08.440]  But before I do that, we have kicked off and we've gone into the first 41 minutes here, ladies and gentlemen, of our global broadcast that we will do for 30 hours,
[42:08.440 --> 42:15.440]  what until five, six o'clock tomorrow to raise awareness and to raise capital and to reach new people.
[42:15.440 --> 42:24.440]  Three goals are to rally our millions of radio listeners and millions of TV viewers and listeners online to really commit every day on email,
[42:24.440 --> 42:33.440]  on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, in person, at the grocery store, at church, at the synagogue, at the Rotary Club, at the golf course,
[42:33.440 --> 42:37.440]  at the shop with your buddies or out hunting, whatever it is.
[42:37.440 --> 42:45.440]  To say this country's in trouble, but we're starting to turn the tide. Globalism is in decline, but they're trying to destroy Alex Jones.
[42:45.440 --> 42:50.440]  They're trying to destroy the few other outlets out there that will tell the truth. We're under attack.
[42:50.440 --> 42:57.440]  So we need to spread the word about info wars. We need to spread the word about the articles and the videos and realize every day,
[42:57.440 --> 43:09.440]  you see news we broke a week before, a month before, a year before word for word on CNN, ABC News, CBS Wall Street Journal, word for word.
[43:09.440 --> 43:20.440]  Two months ago, two and a half months ago, he publishes five, six articles since then with Fannie Mae Freddie Mac with the documents looting up to $300 billion.
[43:20.440 --> 43:28.440]  That's only limited documents he got. It's bigger. We're on a course in a minute, and it all comes out in mainstream news.
[43:28.440 --> 43:35.440]  I'm going to play the clips exactly as we said with the Treasury Secretary saying, we're right and info wars getting credit.
[43:35.440 --> 43:42.440]  This is Dr. Corsi, our DC bureau chief. They are so scared of him. And I've been told, shut up about this or we'll be destroyed.
[43:42.440 --> 43:48.440]  They've got six, seven, eight investigative journalists on me at all times making up crap right now.
[43:48.440 --> 43:59.440]  They're trying to destroy my family right now. They have the Federal Reserve Board of New York suing me right now with George Soros' law firm because they're scared of that guy in DC full time hiring a team.
[43:59.440 --> 44:07.440]  One guy's already torn them up. Now, let's continue. They're scared of info wars. They're scared of Paul Watson. They're scared of all my reporters.
[44:07.440 --> 44:14.440]  They're scared of the crew back there. They're scared of you because we are a focal point like Ron Paul would always say, don't give him credit.
[44:14.440 --> 44:22.440]  He's coming up about 20 minutes. We're going to go to Corsi in a moment. But we're running a specials today to raise capital, huge discounts as well.

[46:53.440 --> 47:02.440]  They're trying to shut down of a system of journalists. They're trying to shut up because we're changing the world now.
[47:02.440 --> 47:08.440]  Let's go to Dr. Jerome Corsi, our DC bureau head. We've got the offices. He's hiring the crew right now.
[47:08.440 --> 47:19.440]  He's doing so much more to help capitalize the operation, help us go to the next level. Dr. Corsi, PhD, Harvard and finance work with the state department and clandestine operations friends with Donald Trump.
[47:19.440 --> 47:23.440]  Three times number one New York Times bestseller. That's all you need to know a game changer.
[47:23.440 --> 47:36.440]  He reported in a slew of articles in February and in April and in March, exclusive Obama literally robbed Fannie and Freddie to fund Obamacare.
[47:36.440 --> 47:42.440]  He got the sealed lawsuits that the Winehouse sources directed us to of just some of the looting close to 300 billion.
[47:42.440 --> 47:48.440]  Now we've learned more. All of this is now confirmed. And again, this is one reason they're coming after us.
[47:48.440 --> 47:56.440]  A month later, Mnuchin on Fannie and Freddie funds used to pay for Obamacare. It's true. Fox Business Wall Street Journal.
[47:56.440 --> 48:03.440]  In his new article out yesterday, Treasury Secretary confirms infowarstore.com reporting on Obama theft of Fannie and Freddie.
[48:03.440 --> 48:11.440]  Dr. Jerome Corsi. This is hard news. This is hard criminal looting that could bring down the entire Democratic power structure.
[48:11.440 --> 48:15.440]  And this is why the Republican establishment is out to get us as well because they're part of it.
[48:15.440 --> 48:21.440]  So Dr. Corsi, thank you. Let's recap what happened and how big this is that after two plus months, it's finally broken.
[48:21.440 --> 48:31.440]  Well, it's been a story we've been working on because it's we found out that Fannie and Freddie, the two mortgage giants, government sponsored entities
[48:31.440 --> 48:42.440]  in August 2012, the Obama administration began taking all the profits from Fannie and Freddie and confiscating them.
[48:42.440 --> 48:51.440]  It's called the net worth sweep. It's a complicated operation. And I got in the middle of it and realized that what was happening was that
[48:51.440 --> 49:05.440]  Congress, the House specifically had refused to fund the insurance premiums, the subsidies for low income families and individuals under Obamacare.
[49:05.440 --> 49:12.440]  And so Obamacare in 2012 was going to tank. It was going to be completely bankrupt and wasn't going to work.
[49:12.440 --> 49:22.440]  And so what the Obama administration did was they took this money from Fannie and Freddie and diverted it without announcing it illegally
[49:22.440 --> 49:27.440]  into paying the Obamacare insurance subsidies.
[49:27.440 --> 49:31.440]  And that's amazing. Obamacare was what, a year old then and it was still going to fail.
[49:31.440 --> 49:40.440]  Yes, it was in the process of failing because the House refused to appropriate the money to pay these subsidies without being able to pay the insurance company.
[49:40.440 --> 49:44.440]  So they looted the taxpayer back system for home owning. That is incredible.
[49:44.440 --> 49:52.440]  That's what they did. And when I first published this and started breaking the news, we were denounced in the mainstream media.
[49:52.440 --> 50:00.440]  We were ridiculed. Even the Washington Examiner did a story. We had a story ridiculing us that was published even in Breitbart.
[50:00.440 --> 50:12.440]  And what I did was I went into the Treasury Department financial reports, specifically their balance sheet, and was able to prove through an analysis of the financial records
[50:12.440 --> 50:21.440]  that in fact the money had been diverted by the Treasury from Fannie and Freddie, the mortgage giants, to pay these insurance subsidiaries,
[50:21.440 --> 50:34.440]  to pay the insurance costs under Obamacare. And the House of Representatives filed a federal district court suit against the Department of Health and Human Services.
[50:34.440 --> 50:43.440]  And a judge in 2016, it was Judge Rosemary Clawyer, said that the House could no longer divert.
[50:43.440 --> 50:45.440]  I mean, the Obama administration could no longer divert money.
[50:45.440 --> 50:51.440]  All right, stay right there. So we've got judges. We've got Congress. No one will report it. Even conservative media is saying we're liars.
[50:51.440 --> 50:56.440]  When you've got sources in Treasury in the White House and the documents, and now two months later, we're totally vindicated.
[50:56.440 --> 51:02.440]  Where are the retractions by Breitbart and the Washington Examiner? Come on, guys, let's pull together in the same direction.
[51:02.440 --> 51:05.440]  I'm not in competition with you. We're trying to defeat the globalists.

[54:04.440 --> 54:21.440]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now.
[54:21.440 --> 54:44.440]  All right, here is the Treasury Secretary Mnuchin on Fox Business a day ago saying that Dr. Jerome Corsi is absolutely on target that, indeed, Obama was looting the money from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac illegally because Congress wouldn't fund it to fund Obamacare in the second year of the program before it was even implemented fully.
[54:44.440 --> 54:55.440]  There's a conversation going on on Twitter and it has been for a long time about how President Obama needed money for Obamacare and would take from all of the agencies and he took from Fannie and Freddie. Is that true?
[54:55.440 --> 55:03.440]  It is true. They used the profits of Fannie and Freddie to pay for other parts of the government while they kept taxpayers at risk.
[55:03.440 --> 55:17.440]  And also, I understand that Fannie and Freddie were exempt from the Freedom of Information Act just last week. I understand that the bill that Kevin McCarthy was pushing through is about taking them out of being exempt.
[55:17.440 --> 55:31.440]  The full clips in Dr. Corsi's article on M4Wars.com. But notice, we're not getting credit. In some of the financial papers, we're getting credit. They're saying, okay, first period M4Wars, you're a respected journalist. You've had three number one New York Times bestselling political books.
[55:31.440 --> 55:42.440]  They admit you changed the course of at least one presidential election. You have all the sources. You got this. I mean, the White House has been trying to get others to report on this. Obviously, for months, we had the courage to do it.
[55:42.440 --> 55:54.440]  And so I'm so ashamed of the other so-called conservative media who we defend, Breitbart and others, when they're under censorship, that they wrote articles saying we were full of crap. What is their problem?
[55:54.440 --> 56:16.440]  Well, the problem, Alex, I think is simple, that the mainstream media and even some of our competitors that we're working with want to support on the conservative side have a hard time acknowledging that M4Wars is publishing the truth. And here we have the Secretary at Treasury confirming the reporting that we did.
[56:16.440 --> 56:38.440]  And I can show you the articles where we were abused Washington Examiner, even on Breitbart. And suddenly we get this confirmation from the Secretary of the Treasury that our reporting was correct from the beginning, that the Obama administration was stealing from Fannie and Freddie illegally to pay subsidies in Obamacare,
[56:38.440 --> 57:00.440]  that the Congress would not fund. But if you look down in the deeper sources, the articles reporting on this, we're getting full credit for it. But at the top level, mainstream media, top level in the even in conservative press, they're not giving kudos to InfoWars for having broken this story.
[57:00.440 --> 57:20.440]  And we broke the story for months, it was very hard reporting, and we were abused for reporting the story. Everybody said it wasn't true. Now it's confirmed, and yet they're not acknowledging that InfoWars was the one who broke the story, except on the internet and except on sources that really know what they're doing and are doing in depth reporting on the question.
[57:20.440 --> 57:23.440]  There we're getting credit.
[57:23.440 --> 57:33.440]  And again, it's not about us tuning our horns saying we were right, we were right. I mean a lot of financial publications did pick it up like Value Walk and others did show that we reported it first.
[57:33.440 --> 57:47.440]  It's just what's frustrating is we do this, we get attacked, the system knows we're telling the truth, they try to destroy us, people need to know, the reason other people won't report this is they know that they come after you.
[57:47.440 --> 57:56.440]  So that's what we're telling listeners, you want somebody to fight hard, you want somebody to be a hard charger, you want somebody to not compromise, you want somebody to actually risk their lives.
[57:56.440 --> 58:09.440]  They're killing people in DC that are exposing stuff like this or exposing, you know, the Democrats trying to steal the election and things like that. Folks are getting shot in the back, they're getting their kids taken away, they're getting sued by the fellow reserve of New York.
[58:09.440 --> 58:20.440]  They're getting sued in the game and so I'm just letting people know this is a serious fight and Dr. Corsi has been proven again absolutely on target. I don't think I've ever seen Dr. Corsi be wrong yet.
[58:20.440 --> 58:29.440]  Well, and this Alex, the reason we get to attack so hard is because the mainstream media is afraid of us getting the truth out.
[58:29.440 --> 58:39.440]  They have to lie and say that, you know, Info Wars is fake news because the truth is it's the mainstream media that wants to protect their fake narrative.
[58:39.440 --> 58:47.440]  That's right, they're the ones that are fake and won't run Trump ads exposing it. Back in 70 seconds to finish up, then Dr. Ron Paul's joining us with big news. Stay with us.
[58:47.440 --> 58:49.440]  Five more with Corsi.
[58:49.440 --> 58:55.440]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:55.440 --> 59:00.440]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[59:00.440 --> 59:11.440]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[59:11.440 --> 59:19.440]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[59:19.440 --> 59:27.440]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites.
[59:27.440 --> 59:29.440]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[59:29.440 --> 59:37.440]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[59:37.440 --> 59:43.440]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, InfoWarsLive.com.
[59:43.440 --> 59:50.440]  And folks, you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period. And you support the broadcast, InfoWarsLive.com.
[59:50.440 --> 59:58.440]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[59:58.440 --> 1:00:07.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:07.440 --> 1:00:16.440]  Thunder struck with the truth, like a lightning bolt from head Wednesday, May 3rd, 2017.
[1:00:16.440 --> 1:00:26.440]  And we've just kicked off a 30-hour transmission in defense of free speech and the West that are both under attack by globalist forces.
[1:00:26.440 --> 1:00:29.440]  The globalists have made a deadly miscalculation.
[1:00:29.440 --> 1:00:37.440]  They are attempting to openly shut down conservative, libertarian, and nationalist news on talk radio, imprint, and on the Internet.
[1:00:37.440 --> 1:00:49.440]  If we simply redouble our efforts, this will blow up in their face, and the population of the world will flock towards the forbidden information that hold the keys to humanity's empowerment and the stars.
[1:00:49.440 --> 1:00:57.440]  This is the defense of the West. This is the defense of free speech. This is the defense of capitalism and free market.
[1:00:57.440 --> 1:01:05.440]  This is the defense of freedom, of prosperity, and the human spirit that refuses to submit.
[1:01:05.440 --> 1:01:11.440]  Dr. Corsi, InfoWars.com DC Bureau Chief. We've got the offices to get the people hired. Thanks for your support.
[1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:16.440]  And big national news that nobody else would tell you. The White House was giving this to other people.
[1:01:16.440 --> 1:01:19.440]  We were some of the first, but nobody else would run with it.
[1:01:19.440 --> 1:01:29.440]  The documents, the lawsuits, the congressional investigations that were all secret, about 290-something billion, now more numbers are coming out, of looted taxpayer money.
[1:01:29.440 --> 1:01:36.440]  And two months later, after we break it, Steve Mnuchin, Treasury Secretary, comes out and says, we've got to put more money into Fannie and Freddie because they looted it.
[1:01:36.440 --> 1:01:39.440]  Obama really looted it. Here's that Fox Business clip.
[1:01:39.440 --> 1:01:50.440]  There's a conversation going on on Twitter, and it has been for a long time, about how President Obama needed money for Obamacare and would take from all of the agencies, and he took from Fannie and Freddie. Is that true?
[1:01:50.440 --> 1:01:58.440]  It is true. They used the profits of Fannie and Freddie to pay for other parts of the government while they kept taxpayers at risk.
[1:01:58.440 --> 1:02:01.440]  And also, I understand that Fannie and Freddie were...
[1:02:01.440 --> 1:02:09.440]  Again, Dr. Corsi, thanks for coming on. I want to get you on later today. If you can do it, we've got a 30-hour broadcast going for a full 30 minutes an hour. Let us know what time you have this evening.
[1:02:09.440 --> 1:02:15.440]  I know you're really busy reporting and getting crew hired, but I want you to come home for a full 30 minutes an hour. We've only got a few minutes for Dr. Paul to join us.
[1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:23.440]  The last numbers I had were almost 300 billion, but you were saying you were getting more documents that was much larger a few weeks ago. Have you discovered anything new?
[1:02:23.440 --> 1:02:35.440]  Well, it's been increasing. I mean, this is something that the Trump administration needs to stop, because in the first quarter, the Trump administration allowed the network sweep to go on.
[1:02:35.440 --> 1:02:40.440]  This is stealing money from the stockholders in Fannie and Freddie.
[1:02:40.440 --> 1:02:42.440]  Wow, so Trump is continuing?
[1:02:42.440 --> 1:02:52.440]  It continued. First quarter, the Trump administration continued it. And right now, I'll be writing a story for tomorrow where the regulators of Fannie and Freddie are asking
[1:02:52.440 --> 1:03:02.440]  President Trump to stop taking the money out of Fannie and Freddie. So this is a good developing story. And again, I think we'll be the first to publish.
[1:03:02.440 --> 1:03:11.440]  Why on earth would the Trump administration give us this intel, and then with the other hand, it's still ongoing? I think that shows how divided the Trump administration is in the last minute we have.
[1:03:11.440 --> 1:03:14.440]  What do you make of Trump 104 days in?
[1:03:14.440 --> 1:03:23.440]  Well, I'm still very impressed with what he has accomplished and how hard it is fighting the Democrats, fighting the mainstream media bureaucracy.
[1:03:23.440 --> 1:03:31.440]  I think a lot of fronts, jobs, closing the border, getting immigration under control, rolling back regulations. There's a lot of wins.
[1:03:31.440 --> 1:03:39.440]  But I've got confidence in President Trump. He's got a lot of obstacles, but I believe he's succeeding and he's going to succeed tremendously.
[1:03:39.440 --> 1:03:49.440]  I've been very close to President Trump. You know, I've known him for 40 years, and I've never seen him fail. And he's on the same track I've seen before of success.
[1:03:49.440 --> 1:03:52.440]  I'm 100% confident he's going to succeed.
[1:03:52.440 --> 1:04:00.440]  So this is, I mean, obviously, I don't want to get into sources, but the White House wanted this to come out. So it's like it's still going on showing how the bureaucracy just does what it wants.
[1:04:00.440 --> 1:04:11.440]  Well, and also, we realized, Alex, that when the White House was saying all we have to do is stop funding Obamacare, that was because of our reporting.
[1:04:11.440 --> 1:04:23.440]  We reported that all that President Trump would have to do is drop the appeal on this Burwell case and the fact that you can't divert money to pay for Fannie and Freddie when Congress wouldn't fund it.
[1:04:23.440 --> 1:04:28.440]  Stan, and the Trump administration was picking up on our report.
[1:04:28.440 --> 1:04:32.440]  When can you come on later for 30 minutes today and really directly speak to Trump?
[1:04:32.440 --> 1:04:41.440]  Because I know they're listening to you because you're an expert from Harvard on this, on finance, how he can kill it, because I see them mirroring what you're saying and then in consultation. When can you come back on today?
[1:04:41.440 --> 1:04:43.440]  Any time you want me. I'm available all day.
[1:04:43.440 --> 1:04:48.440]  Okay, I'm going to have Nico find a slot for you because I want you to really have the floor and break this down so we can announce it and tweet it.
[1:04:48.440 --> 1:04:54.440]  Great job on your investigative journalism. Every week you are just breaking huge news. I'm so proud to have you part of the operation, sir.
[1:04:54.440 --> 1:04:57.440]  I'm proud to be part of the operation. Thank you, Alex.
[1:04:57.440 --> 1:05:03.440]  Thank you. All right, Congressman Ron Paul, former congressman, medical doctors joining us to talk about the state of the world straight ahead.
[1:05:27.440 --> 1:05:38.440]  This may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the right to keep in bare arms is not an outdated, dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the Redcoats.
[1:05:38.440 --> 1:05:43.440]  No, it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[1:05:43.440 --> 1:05:50.440]  The original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contained 10 of what the constitutional framers termed unalienable rights.
[1:05:50.440 --> 1:05:53.440]  The Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on.
[1:05:53.440 --> 1:06:02.440]  It doesn't recognize color or class or wealth. It protects not just the rights of actors or editors or reporters, but extends even to those we love to hate.
[1:06:02.440 --> 1:06:24.440]  This is a small excerpt from Charlton Heston.
[1:06:33.440 --> 1:06:36.440]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[1:06:36.440 --> 1:06:39.440]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[1:06:39.440 --> 1:06:43.440]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine, some of the bad halogen fluoride.
[1:06:43.440 --> 1:06:50.440]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used in biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[1:06:50.440 --> 1:06:57.440]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.
[1:06:57.440 --> 1:07:05.440]  Learn more about InfoWarsLife super blue toothpaste at InfoWarsLife.com and support the InfoWars while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[1:07:05.440 --> 1:07:09.440]  A new shipment of Biotrusillinium is now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[1:07:09.440 --> 1:07:11.440]  We've been sold out for months.
[1:07:11.440 --> 1:07:16.440]  Our one-of-a-kind InfoWarsLife Biotrusillinium formula is now back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[1:07:16.440 --> 1:07:20.440]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the pharmaceutical industry to its core.
[1:07:20.440 --> 1:07:24.440]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium.
[1:07:24.440 --> 1:07:29.440]  But Biotrusillinium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[1:07:29.440 --> 1:07:33.440]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[1:07:33.440 --> 1:07:37.440]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight.
[1:07:37.440 --> 1:07:42.440]  Biotrusillinium is also the perfect supercharger, a survival shield X2 nascent iodine,
[1:07:42.440 --> 1:07:45.440]  as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[1:07:45.440 --> 1:07:50.440]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to order your bottle of Biotrusillinium before we sell out again.
[1:07:50.440 --> 1:07:55.440]  That's InfoWarsLife.com to secure your selenium and other key products that don't only help yourself and your family,
[1:07:55.440 --> 1:07:59.440]  but also fund our operation against the globalist, A360W.
[1:07:59.440 --> 1:08:01.440]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[1:08:01.440 --> 1:08:27.440]  This is the time to support InfoWars. That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[1:08:27.440 --> 1:08:31.440]  It is a paradox, the best of times, the worst of times.
[1:08:31.440 --> 1:08:34.440]  Ron Paul ran for president back in the 90s and failed.
[1:08:34.440 --> 1:08:37.440]  Maybe one out of 100 people knew the Federal Reserve was private.
[1:08:37.440 --> 1:08:43.440]  Today everybody knows it. Globalism is openly hated and is in decline around the world.
[1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:46.440]  But the problem is we're still left with the same old corrupt political systems.
[1:08:46.440 --> 1:08:52.440]  And I had really hoped that Trump would be a paragon of true liberty.
[1:08:52.440 --> 1:08:57.440]  He's done a lot of good things like TPP and trying to get jobs back.
[1:08:57.440 --> 1:09:00.440]  But I got to tell you, the healthcare bill he supported, bad.
[1:09:00.440 --> 1:09:03.440]  This new spending bill, bad.
[1:09:03.440 --> 1:09:08.440]  A lot of the things he's doing, going after Julian Assange, when he said Julian, release it all.
[1:09:08.440 --> 1:09:13.440]  If we were going to indict Julian Assange, who's a hero, or Snowden, who I think is a hero,
[1:09:13.440 --> 1:09:16.440]  then we've got to have Trump call for his own indictment.
[1:09:16.440 --> 1:09:22.440]  And somebody who's really been warning of that is former congressman and, of course, medical doctor Ron Paul,
[1:09:22.440 --> 1:09:30.440]  who is undoubtedly the greatest living granddaddy of the liberty movement worldwide that we see just exploding.
[1:09:30.440 --> 1:09:32.440]  So again, a lot of good things happening, a lot of bad things happening.
[1:09:32.440 --> 1:09:38.440]  But the fact that even Trump would get elected as a patriot, as a nationalist, as kind of a libertarian,
[1:09:38.440 --> 1:09:43.440]  whether he ends up delivering on that or not, it shows how far we've come.
[1:09:43.440 --> 1:09:48.440]  As Ron Paul always said, he had some chances to win the presidency. He was leading in many states.
[1:09:48.440 --> 1:09:52.440]  He said, when I get in, I'm not going to be a dictator. I can't fix it all. It's a cultural thing.
[1:09:52.440 --> 1:09:55.440]  But I think we've hit bottom. I think we're coming back. Maybe I'm wrong.
[1:09:55.440 --> 1:10:00.440]  We'll see what Ron Paul, with his great liberty report, reaching millions every day on radio and TV,
[1:10:00.440 --> 1:10:04.440]  joining us from Houston, has to say, but wow, so much to cover.
[1:10:04.440 --> 1:10:07.440]  What do you want to tackle first, sir?
[1:10:07.440 --> 1:10:11.440]  Well, nothing in particular, whatever is in the events.
[1:10:11.440 --> 1:10:16.440]  Well, you maybe having some technical difficulties. We'll work on that for just a second.
[1:10:16.440 --> 1:10:18.440]  An echo.
[1:10:18.440 --> 1:10:22.440]  I think he's getting a bad feedback. We'll work on that with the congressman here for just a second.
[1:10:22.440 --> 1:10:28.440]  The wonders of TV studios. This happens even on Fox News and CNN.
[1:10:28.440 --> 1:10:30.440]  Dr. Paul, can you hear me now?
[1:10:30.440 --> 1:10:36.440]  I can hear you. Let's try it. The trouble is, is my voice is way too loud.
[1:10:36.440 --> 1:10:41.440]  You know, I know what it's like when you're on Skype and your voice is coming back to you and it's very hard
[1:10:41.440 --> 1:10:45.440]  when it comes back delayed and really loud. It's crazy. Let's just begin with this.
[1:10:45.440 --> 1:10:47.440]  We'll give it a try. We'll try it.
[1:10:47.440 --> 1:10:52.440]  We'll give it a try. I know it's annoying. What do you make of Donald Trump so far?
[1:10:52.440 --> 1:10:57.440]  It does appear that he's really starting to go off track of what he said he was going to do.
[1:10:57.440 --> 1:11:01.440]  Well, I think people are starting to recognize that now.
[1:11:01.440 --> 1:11:09.440]  Our biggest problem in evaluating Trump is we don't know what he'll say tomorrow or the day before yesterday
[1:11:09.440 --> 1:11:14.440]  because it's back and forth. You know, we sort of liked him before he was elected
[1:11:14.440 --> 1:11:20.440]  because searching for things that I liked, I liked the fact that he thought we ought to be more reasonable dealing with Russia.
[1:11:20.440 --> 1:11:27.440]  And then he changed all of a sudden, but just recently again, he's talking about, hey, we better lay off Russia.
[1:11:27.440 --> 1:11:32.440]  It's this lack of understanding of what his real policies are
[1:11:32.440 --> 1:11:41.440]  means that the unpredictability of this is very disturbing. We ought to at least know where people stand.
[1:11:41.440 --> 1:11:50.440]  Well, I agree. You wrote on your Liberty Report last week about, you know, here's President Trump saying,
[1:11:50.440 --> 1:11:58.440]  I love WikiLeaks, give him a medal, and then now he's saying arrest WikiLeaks. I mean, that is a real betrayal when WikiLeaks was exposing criminal activity.
[1:11:58.440 --> 1:12:02.440]  There's your headline candidate, Trump. I love WikiLeaks. President Trump, arrest Assange.
[1:12:02.440 --> 1:12:09.440]  Trump claims he's all about loyalty, and I've seen that in his past. Do you think the deep state has gotten to him?
[1:12:09.440 --> 1:12:16.440]  Oh, you know, it's hard for me to figure out. We can say what he has done, but we can't really read his mind on what's going on.
[1:12:16.440 --> 1:12:22.440]  I don't think he approaches things, as so many of us try to do, from a philosophic principle.
[1:12:22.440 --> 1:12:28.440]  I think his principle is pragmatism and do what you have to do or whatever crosses your mind at the moment.
[1:12:28.440 --> 1:12:37.440]  But it would be very, very disappointing if he was calling everybody's bluff, that when he was saying everything intentionally,
[1:12:37.440 --> 1:12:41.440]  I'm going to get in office and I'm going to be the best neocon ever, you know, this sort of thing.
[1:12:41.440 --> 1:12:49.440]  That would be the most distasteful. The best excuse I can give him is that he doesn't come from a firm set of principles,
[1:12:49.440 --> 1:12:54.440]  and then he does yield to the political pressures, because he does express things like,
[1:12:54.440 --> 1:13:00.440]  oh, I didn't know this was so complicated, and that is true. He didn't know too much about how things worked in Washington,
[1:13:00.440 --> 1:13:08.440]  and you can't run Washington like you run a business, and that's always been a mistake to think that you can,
[1:13:08.440 --> 1:13:14.440]  because it isn't a business. A business that run efficiently and governs are inefficient,
[1:13:14.440 --> 1:13:20.440]  and that is the reason you want very little government, because they can't manage health care.
[1:13:20.440 --> 1:13:24.440]  It isn't the mismanagement, it's the fact that they're trying to manage health care.
[1:13:24.440 --> 1:13:29.440]  So that's the way it is with government, and now he's recognized this, and he can't bully his way through that
[1:13:29.440 --> 1:13:32.440]  and just say, I am the boss, you know, and this is what's going to happen.
[1:13:32.440 --> 1:13:38.440]  There are too many other, everybody in Washington thinks they're the boss, and they like to play this game,
[1:13:38.440 --> 1:13:43.440]  and they don't come from the position of what we really want is a lot less government.
[1:13:43.440 --> 1:13:47.440]  So when he talks about draining the swamp, or some of us have in our minds,
[1:13:47.440 --> 1:13:52.440]  oh, that means he's going to have a lot less, you know, government spending.
[1:13:52.440 --> 1:13:58.440]  But the spending is the same. Well, stuff, the spending is going to go up, and the militarism is going to go up,
[1:13:58.440 --> 1:14:03.440]  and our first amendments are going to be attacked, and Planned Parenthood is going to get their money plus a little.
[1:14:03.440 --> 1:14:08.440]  So that has to be discouraging to a lot of people who had supported Trump.
[1:14:08.440 --> 1:14:12.440]  So the swamp really isn't getting drained. I mean, I guess it's getting drained a little bit.
[1:14:12.440 --> 1:14:15.440]  What's happening is Trump's getting drained.
[1:14:15.440 --> 1:14:20.440]  Yeah, I think so. I mean, there's a bit of realism there for him.
[1:14:20.440 --> 1:14:28.440]  But I think, you know, it was unrealistic to say that, you know, just look at me, and I can do this, this, this.
[1:14:28.440 --> 1:14:32.440]  I mean, there was a lot of positive things, but people wanted the positive things.
[1:14:32.440 --> 1:14:39.440]  You know, one of the characteristics of Ronald Reagan was that people saw him as being very positive and not talking about the problems.
[1:14:39.440 --> 1:14:47.440]  Sometimes what I'm amazed at is over the years, I've talked about all the problems, and I feel like, oh, I'm too negative.
[1:14:47.440 --> 1:14:55.440]  But the one thing is, is so many young people, if they listen to our message and you come up with just a hint,
[1:14:55.440 --> 1:14:58.440]  this doesn't have to be this way. There are answers.
[1:14:58.440 --> 1:15:06.440]  Actually, describing something as negative is a blessing, and it's a positive because you're telling them the truth and they recognize it.
[1:15:06.440 --> 1:15:10.440]  But to say that everything is rosy without really describing it and what you're going to do.
[1:15:10.440 --> 1:15:18.440]  So I feel very comfortable in describing the problems of the Federal Reserve and the budget spending and the foreign policy and the attack on civil liberties.
[1:15:18.440 --> 1:15:27.440]  But then to come up with the answer, which is a constitutional answer, as well as an answer that is embedded with the principles of liberty,
[1:15:27.440 --> 1:15:31.440]  and that if you're looking for peace and prosperity, you go in that direction.
[1:15:31.440 --> 1:15:37.440]  So it's a very positive message, and I think you've recognized this over the year that people like to hear that.
[1:15:37.440 --> 1:15:45.440]  And you can still talk about the negatives, but it comes across as telling the truth rather than just saying,
[1:15:45.440 --> 1:15:50.440]  everything is wrote hunky dory, all we have to do is ABC, and everything is going to be perfect again.
[1:15:50.440 --> 1:15:53.440]  See, after a while, that is not believable.
[1:15:53.440 --> 1:15:54.440]  Absolutely.
[1:15:54.440 --> 1:15:56.440]  I guess what's happening, that's what's happening right now.
[1:15:56.440 --> 1:16:01.440]  People are realizing that the rhetoric is as far surpassed the results.
[1:16:01.440 --> 1:16:07.440]  Dr. Ron Paul, you mentioned attacks on free speech, and I want to get into that in a moment because you've had that happen, I've had that happen.
[1:16:07.440 --> 1:16:12.440]  But I happen to know the President does respect you, he says he respects you, and he's getting along with Rand now,
[1:16:12.440 --> 1:16:18.440]  and it's hopefully listening to him about getting a better bill to replace Obamacare, not just have Obamacare light.
[1:16:18.440 --> 1:16:22.440]  So it's good to see Rand, who I think is the best senator in Congress.
[1:16:22.440 --> 1:16:27.440]  Matt Drudge agrees with that, and obviously met with him a month ago or so and said he is the best senator,
[1:16:27.440 --> 1:16:32.440]  obviously from your tutelage and his own research and life, he does have the grasp on that.
[1:16:32.440 --> 1:16:37.440]  I would hope that the President would get closer to Rand, and obviously get more of his advice,
[1:16:37.440 --> 1:16:42.440]  because your son is more of a purist Americana, but separately from that,
[1:16:42.440 --> 1:16:47.440]  just spend a few minutes on advice to the President, because I know he does actually tune into the show,
[1:16:47.440 --> 1:16:51.440]  he does actually crave what the public thinks, he respects you.
[1:16:51.440 --> 1:16:55.440]  Just spend a few minutes on what you would say to the President.
[1:16:55.440 --> 1:17:00.440]  Well, of course, you know, if it's not, if you're not invited, it doesn't do much good,
[1:17:00.440 --> 1:17:07.440]  but I can try to accommodate what you're saying, but it's very rare that people in Washington really want your advice.
[1:17:07.440 --> 1:17:15.440]  I was always told is study hard, understand it, present your case, and somebody will come to you,
[1:17:15.440 --> 1:17:20.440]  and there will be a job for you, and you present your case, and on a few occasions in Washington,
[1:17:20.440 --> 1:17:25.440]  I had other members that were very serious, you know, and they did a bit of a conversion,
[1:17:25.440 --> 1:17:30.440]  you know, say on foreign policy or something, so that is always possible,
[1:17:30.440 --> 1:17:37.440]  but to just decide you're going to advise somebody, it's not real practical, they're not going to pay a lot of attention,
[1:17:37.440 --> 1:17:38.440]  but indeed...
[1:17:38.440 --> 1:17:42.440]  Sure, what should Trump do? I mean, he does listen to you, he says he respects you, he's tweeted that,
[1:17:42.440 --> 1:17:47.440]  I mean, he will listen to you, I mean, what do you think Trump's done good, what's he done bad?
[1:17:47.440 --> 1:17:52.440]  Well, I think he's backed down on, you know, the spending and all,
[1:17:52.440 --> 1:17:57.440]  and if my advice would be let the Congress go ahead and pass these bills, tell them what you want,
[1:17:57.440 --> 1:18:04.440]  let them pass it, and then veto the bill, you know, but try not to be flip-flopping all over the place,
[1:18:04.440 --> 1:18:10.440]  you know, some of us really want him to do what he claimed he was going to do,
[1:18:10.440 --> 1:18:14.440]  but you know, when I look at it, then all of a sudden I see, well, all the presidents said,
[1:18:14.440 --> 1:18:20.440]  in recent years, the one that is a little less militant is usually the one that wins the election,
[1:18:20.440 --> 1:18:26.440]  and Trump was less militant, so I would say work toward consistency and get rid of the flip-flopping,
[1:18:26.440 --> 1:18:34.440]  and if you believe in less government, stick to that, but you can't pretend to hold on to people who want less government,
[1:18:34.440 --> 1:18:39.440]  and you're increasing the budget, and you spend more money and say you want to spend it on such and such,
[1:18:39.440 --> 1:18:44.440]  well, we'll give you that. Well, let me ask you this then. Where do you think it's going?
[1:18:44.440 --> 1:18:52.440]  Because he did some good things like TPP and a lot of other things, but then suddenly it seemed by day 70 really went off trajectory.
[1:18:52.440 --> 1:18:57.440]  I think that's part of that coup against Bannon. As soon as Bannon was demoted, we saw the trajectory change.
[1:18:57.440 --> 1:19:04.440]  Is there any way in your mind to get him back on trajectory? Yeah, well, I think it's very secondary to what's going on,
[1:19:04.440 --> 1:19:13.440]  because, you know, let's say tomorrow there's a beginning of an economic bust like it happened in 2008.
[1:19:13.440 --> 1:19:17.440]  Trump's not responsible for that, but he'll get blamed for it, that sort of thing.
[1:19:17.440 --> 1:19:25.440]  So I think things are out of control of an individual like this, so it's not what should Trump do.
[1:19:25.440 --> 1:19:32.440]  The country's bankrupt, and doing what they're doing, the establishment Republicans and Democrats,
[1:19:32.440 --> 1:19:39.440]  I mean, they have always gotten together with these on-the-bus bills and these continuing resolutions,
[1:19:39.440 --> 1:19:45.440]  and they always spend more money. They endorse intervention overseas. They endorse the financial system, the Federal Reserve.
[1:19:45.440 --> 1:19:53.440]  They're not opposed to... More of the same. But it's not because all of a sudden Trump is sticking to his word.
[1:19:53.440 --> 1:20:01.440]  It's the fact that the country is addicted to spending. I was about to say, we saw federal agencies just ignoring him
[1:20:01.440 --> 1:20:05.440]  when he was trying to do the right thing, and just basically the deep state refusing,
[1:20:05.440 --> 1:20:08.440]  something you've talked a lot about, so let's speak to that.
[1:20:08.440 --> 1:20:11.440]  Sorry, go ahead.
[1:20:11.440 --> 1:20:16.440]  But the people are responsible too. Congress is a mess.
[1:20:16.440 --> 1:20:23.440]  But the people, you know, why they had to back off, why the Republican leadership backed off on Obamacare,
[1:20:23.440 --> 1:20:26.440]  is the yelling and screaming and the noise that was made by people saying,
[1:20:26.440 --> 1:20:32.440]  I have a right to medical care, I want free medical care, and you can't take it away from it.
[1:20:32.440 --> 1:20:37.440]  So there's still a lot of people out there who still believe in the financial system.
[1:20:37.440 --> 1:20:39.440]  They want something, quote, free today.
[1:20:39.440 --> 1:20:45.440]  Right, and that's the bigger problem compared to what's Trump going to do tomorrow versus yesterday.
[1:20:45.440 --> 1:20:50.440]  Sure, we're the problem. Our decade of population is a problem.
[1:20:50.440 --> 1:20:55.440]  Unless you accept a different position on the role of government, none of this is going to be solved.
[1:20:55.440 --> 1:20:56.440]  Sure, it's fundamental.
[1:20:56.440 --> 1:21:00.440]  And I don't think, I think that no matter what we put up in Washington,
[1:21:00.440 --> 1:21:05.440]  we're going into a very, very dire economic problem.
[1:21:05.440 --> 1:21:12.440]  And I think our empire is going to end, and unfortunately the whistleblowers are going to be attacked more than ever.
[1:21:12.440 --> 1:21:21.440]  But in the end, what we need is a whole generation of people advocating and understanding what liberty is all about.
[1:21:21.440 --> 1:21:27.440]  That's what happened during our original revolution, and now we don't need the old revolution.
[1:21:27.440 --> 1:21:32.440]  We need the expansion of those views that were held by the founders, and it has to be endorsed.
[1:21:32.440 --> 1:21:40.440]  Not just by a few of us, we need more people to the point where not every TV now supports the state.
[1:21:40.440 --> 1:21:44.440]  You know, the Republican TV is not much better than the Democratic TV.
[1:21:44.440 --> 1:21:49.440]  So we need 1776, 2.0. So in the few minutes we have left, let me bring this up to you.
[1:21:49.440 --> 1:21:53.440]  I don't know if you saw it, but it was in National News.
[1:21:53.440 --> 1:21:59.440]  I got the secret documents through Mike Cernovich that Google was spending millions of dollars to delist info wars.
[1:21:59.440 --> 1:22:05.440]  And they listed because I played clips of Ron Paul saying this is probably a false flag in Syria,
[1:22:05.440 --> 1:22:09.440]  and because I played Putin, and because I played some army colonels.
[1:22:09.440 --> 1:22:12.440]  And they said, this is an example of fake news.
[1:22:12.440 --> 1:22:17.440]  So delist Alex Jones and have an army of trolls go out and start voting him down.
[1:22:17.440 --> 1:22:22.440]  Now, because we published the document two days later, they said, OK, rogue contractors did that.
[1:22:22.440 --> 1:22:25.440]  We're going to stop now. But it wasn't because you were fake news.
[1:22:25.440 --> 1:22:31.440]  They admitted in 2013, 2016 that the rebels got caught launching fake attacks.
[1:22:31.440 --> 1:22:35.440]  We had this rush to judgment. The British ambassador says it's clearly the rebels.
[1:22:35.440 --> 1:22:39.440]  It sets a precedent where the rebels can stage events, and then we rushed to judgment.
[1:22:39.440 --> 1:22:46.440]  Your son helped lead the move in the Senate to not have a rush to judgment in 2013 and be Al Qaeda slash ISIS's Air Force.
[1:22:46.440 --> 1:22:51.440]  So we've now gotten to the point where I have a member of the Federal Reserve Board of New York suing me.
[1:22:51.440 --> 1:22:55.440]  I've been told shut up. I have George Soros's firm suing me.
[1:22:55.440 --> 1:23:00.440]  I have Dr. Corsi breaking that Obama looted 300 billion out of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac for Obamacare.
[1:23:00.440 --> 1:23:03.440]  I've been told shut up about that or we'll destroy you.
[1:23:03.440 --> 1:23:07.440]  So that's the type of stuff, the type of messages that I've got now.
[1:23:07.440 --> 1:23:11.440]  I know as a congressman, you probably got threats too, but I've never had it at this level.
[1:23:11.440 --> 1:23:16.440]  What do you make of that? And why do you think they were so scared of me?
[1:23:16.440 --> 1:23:19.440]  They listed playing Ron Paul clips.
[1:23:19.440 --> 1:23:26.440]  Well, they're protecting the state and they're protecting the deep state as well.
[1:23:26.440 --> 1:23:34.440]  Two individuals that went to prison that were in Congress for one major reason.
[1:23:34.440 --> 1:23:37.440]  They were both very, very strong anti IRS and wrote books against them.
[1:23:37.440 --> 1:23:46.440]  I think that was their major problem. And the same way, what we have developed here is sort of a fascist system.
[1:23:46.440 --> 1:23:53.440]  You know, the government doesn't own Google and all this social media, but they have control over it.
[1:23:53.440 --> 1:23:57.440]  And they've sold out to the government because they're collecting all the information.
[1:23:57.440 --> 1:24:03.440]  Oh, the government doesn't collect this, but if we need it, Google will give it to us and all these organizations on Facebook,
[1:24:03.440 --> 1:24:06.440]  they'll give it to them because they're exempt from any liability.
[1:24:06.440 --> 1:24:13.440]  The Congress gave them the exemption that you can't go and if somebody in social media has turned over your information,
[1:24:13.440 --> 1:24:16.440]  they're not liable, but the Congress gave them that.
[1:24:16.440 --> 1:24:22.440]  So it's a mixture of big business and big government and it's a terrible thing.
[1:24:22.440 --> 1:24:29.440]  And there's big money involved that has nothing to do with helping the poor people or helping the middle class get medical care.
[1:24:29.440 --> 1:24:38.440]  It's power and it's control and it's the protection of the state and that's why whistleblowers are the greatest enemies of this.
[1:24:38.440 --> 1:24:42.440]  You know, truth becomes treason when you have an empire and we have an empire.
[1:24:42.440 --> 1:24:49.440]  So anybody who tells the truth and it would be in relative levels, they're going to go after those individuals.
[1:24:49.440 --> 1:24:51.440]  So that's what we're up against.
[1:24:51.440 --> 1:24:55.440]  When I left the Congress this past time, I listed some of the concerns.
[1:24:55.440 --> 1:25:01.440]  And my number one concern was the destruction of the First Amendment to speak out, believing sincerely.
[1:25:01.440 --> 1:25:09.440]  If you and I still have the privilege, the right to speak out without the government coming down on us,
[1:25:09.440 --> 1:25:14.440]  that we could change the system because ideas have consequences and they're more powerful than armies.
[1:25:14.440 --> 1:25:24.440]  But our enemies, the opposition understands this because if we can silence people, we can silence those ideas.
[1:25:24.440 --> 1:25:26.440]  I don't think they can.
[1:25:26.440 --> 1:25:29.440]  Ideas can't be stopped by the armies and we know that.
[1:25:29.440 --> 1:25:37.440]  So I think the ideology is where the battle has to be, not with what Trump is going to do tomorrow.
[1:25:37.440 --> 1:25:39.440]  I agree. Let me just say this in closing.
[1:25:39.440 --> 1:25:42.440]  I am very honored to be demonized like you have been over the years.
[1:25:42.440 --> 1:25:44.440]  I'm very honored to join that exclusive club.
[1:25:44.440 --> 1:25:47.440]  It's just crazy the way they lie, the way they twist, the way they call us racist,
[1:25:47.440 --> 1:25:50.440]  when we're the total opposite of that, promoting Martin Luther King.
[1:25:50.440 --> 1:25:55.440]  And I just see, as you say, all the economists saying if we don't turn things around soon,
[1:25:55.440 --> 1:25:57.440]  we're going to implode into a worldwide depression.
[1:25:57.440 --> 1:26:00.440]  And I just feel sorry for the people in the establishment.
[1:26:00.440 --> 1:26:05.440]  Most media admits that they're not really against us, but they will lose their job if they don't attack us.
[1:26:05.440 --> 1:26:10.440]  And so there's got to be some way that we all just speak out and kind of turn the tide here.
[1:26:10.440 --> 1:26:14.440]  But in closing, do you think there's any way to turn around economic collapse now?
[1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:17.440]  And where do you see all this militarism going?
[1:26:17.440 --> 1:26:19.440]  Where do you see this planet going?
[1:26:19.440 --> 1:26:22.440]  Well, in theory, you can.
[1:26:22.440 --> 1:26:26.440]  I mean, if you had the right people in the right places and in the Congress,
[1:26:26.440 --> 1:26:28.440]  you could devise a transition.
[1:26:28.440 --> 1:26:31.440]  Actually, and that's what I talked about in the presidential races,
[1:26:31.440 --> 1:26:36.440]  where you could do it as a transition, but you would have to systematically cut back.
[1:26:36.440 --> 1:26:39.440]  The odds of that happening are essentially nil.
[1:26:39.440 --> 1:26:45.440]  So what we have to do is continue to present the case for the cause of liberty
[1:26:45.440 --> 1:26:48.440]  to replace the system that will self-destruct.
[1:26:48.440 --> 1:26:55.440]  I mean, there was no self-planning about how to get rid of communism in the communist system.
[1:26:55.440 --> 1:26:57.440]  The old empire just fell.
[1:26:57.440 --> 1:27:01.440]  It just happened. It fell apart, and it wasn't because we built more weapons.
[1:27:01.440 --> 1:27:03.440]  It was a flawed system.
[1:27:03.440 --> 1:27:05.440]  Our system is flawed. It will collapse.
[1:27:05.440 --> 1:27:11.440]  We probably won't have enough good sense to just cut back because the people who are dependent on the government,
[1:27:11.440 --> 1:27:14.440]  and like I said, the rich and the poor, become dependent.
[1:27:14.440 --> 1:27:19.440]  So when the collapse comes, we have to have enough people understanding what true liberty is all about,
[1:27:19.440 --> 1:27:26.440]  and we have to advance the cause of liberty more so than even the advancement we had at the time of our revolution.
[1:27:26.440 --> 1:27:31.440]  So you think it's fair to say Trump is not averting the collapse and it's closer than ever?
[1:27:31.440 --> 1:27:34.440]  Well, I think it's not relevant.
[1:27:34.440 --> 1:27:38.440]  I don't think anybody in Washington at the moment is very relevant,
[1:27:38.440 --> 1:27:46.440]  because I think what people are thinking and learning in their schools and where they're getting their information,
[1:27:46.440 --> 1:27:48.440]  that is relevant.
[1:27:48.440 --> 1:27:54.440]  And trying to get some young people to be involved to help with the replacement.
[1:27:54.440 --> 1:27:59.440]  Sure, the last question. Aren't you concerned historically as a historian, not just a doctor and a former congressman,
[1:27:59.440 --> 1:28:04.440]  but I know you're with the Von Mies Institute as an economist and historian,
[1:28:04.440 --> 1:28:08.440]  but what governments and empires almost always launch a war before they let themselves fall,
[1:28:08.440 --> 1:28:12.440]  China's teetering, the EU's teetering even worse than us, we're teetering,
[1:28:12.440 --> 1:28:14.440]  you know, we're the best house in a bad neighborhood.
[1:28:14.440 --> 1:28:20.440]  This just, if you look at this historically and project forward, this is like a dystopic novel, what we're going into.
[1:28:20.440 --> 1:28:25.440]  Yeah, well, I don't know whether it's that deliberate, but the war is related.
[1:28:25.440 --> 1:28:31.440]  I think the war is bringing you to the destruction and we've been involved for all these years and we're involved steadily right now,
[1:28:31.440 --> 1:28:34.440]  and that's totally out of control, so that will bring it.
[1:28:34.440 --> 1:28:41.440]  Yeah, they might try to make a bigger war, but by the time it's recognized how bad off we are, they won't be able to.
[1:28:41.440 --> 1:28:46.440]  So war is related, but the wars have already been there and that's, you know,
[1:28:46.440 --> 1:28:52.440]  hurrying up the destruction of the economy and it will bring us down economically.
[1:28:52.440 --> 1:28:55.440]  Sure. Well, your son's teaching a course on dystopia and the left's mad at him.
[1:28:55.440 --> 1:29:01.440]  It seems like they think on May Day that communism is great, but look at Venezuela, look at everywhere else.
[1:29:01.440 --> 1:29:05.440]  Is the best website, RonPaulLibertyReport.com, because you've got a lot of websites.
[1:29:05.440 --> 1:29:10.440]  Yeah, I know, the LibertyReport.com is the one that we're working the hardest on,
[1:29:10.440 --> 1:29:15.440]  and that's where our program comes out every day at 11 o'clock Central Time.
[1:29:15.440 --> 1:29:19.440]  It's live, but it's been very successful.
[1:29:19.440 --> 1:29:23.440]  It's growing and the more people that can join us there, the happier we'll be.
[1:29:23.440 --> 1:29:26.440]  All right, well, thank you for the time and I got to say it again.
[1:29:26.440 --> 1:29:31.440]  You used to work yourself to death and you look great, but for your age, you look like 10 years younger now.
[1:29:31.440 --> 1:29:35.440]  So let me guess, you like being a journalist now?
[1:29:35.440 --> 1:29:42.440]  Well, I don't think of myself as anything in particularly other than trying to fully understand what Liberty means,
[1:29:42.440 --> 1:29:47.440]  who benefits, and a better way to present it to the people who are interested in learning.
[1:29:47.440 --> 1:29:51.440]  A true watchman on the wall, a 21st century Paul Revere. Thank you, Dr. Paul.
[1:29:51.440 --> 1:29:54.440]  Have a great week coming up, sir.
[1:29:54.440 --> 1:29:55.440]  Thank you.
[1:29:55.440 --> 1:29:58.440]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:58.440 --> 1:30:24.440]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:29.440 --> 1:30:32.440]  Forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology.
[1:30:32.440 --> 1:30:40.440]  Needless to say, this is a direct violation of our fourth amendment and they have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying,
[1:30:40.440 --> 1:30:49.440]  where we now know that police are collecting information on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes.
[1:30:49.440 --> 1:30:54.440]  Once again, more evidence that the police state isn't coming. It's already here.
[1:30:54.440 --> 1:31:01.440]  This is Darren McBreen and I invite you to join the resistance. Infowars.com.

[1:32:28.440 --> 1:32:34.440]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene,
[1:32:34.440 --> 1:32:40.440]  Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight. There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender
[1:32:40.440 --> 1:32:44.440]  to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor. It works.
[1:32:44.440 --> 1:32:50.440]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification
[1:32:50.440 --> 1:32:56.440]  from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory. Defender Body Armor is now available through InfowarsStore.com
[1:32:56.440 --> 1:33:02.440]  so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Infowar against the globalists all at the same time.
[1:33:02.440 --> 1:33:27.440]  A total 361.
[1:33:32.440 --> 1:34:00.440]  Hollywood Babylon, baby.
[1:34:00.440 --> 1:34:06.440]  We've got Katherine Austin Fitz who worked in the Clinton administration. She did all the corruption.
[1:34:06.440 --> 1:34:12.440]  The banking HUD, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, so much more. Always great to have her on Mike Sternovich.
[1:34:12.440 --> 1:34:16.440]  We've got so many other people coming up in this 30-hour global transmission.
[1:34:16.440 --> 1:34:21.440]  A bunch of clips, a bunch of military news, a bunch of really important stuff I have to get to.
[1:34:21.440 --> 1:34:26.440]  Sybil Defense Expert, White Genocide Eminent in South Africa. And that's happened in the Congo.
[1:34:26.440 --> 1:34:31.440]  It's happened in Rhodesia. It's happened basically everywhere in Africa to the point of pure starvation
[1:34:31.440 --> 1:34:36.440]  when the white farmers and the infrastructure get driven out. It's happened with Robert Mugabe.
[1:34:36.440 --> 1:34:41.440]  It's a fact that stories up on Infowars.com are very, very sad, but that's what ends up happening.
[1:34:41.440 --> 1:34:46.440]  And that happens in any tribal culture. The Africans are always genociding each other depending on tribal lines,
[1:34:46.440 --> 1:34:51.440]  depending on what animus group you're in or what Muslim group you're in or what Christian group you're in.
[1:34:51.440 --> 1:34:56.440]  Tribes, even in the same tribe, kill each other routinely. So just imagine.
[1:34:56.440 --> 1:35:00.440]  That's a conquest-based economy, not a resource-based economy, more and more.
[1:35:00.440 --> 1:35:05.440]  Now that Libya has been destroyed, South Africa has been gone from one tyranny to another.
[1:35:05.440 --> 1:35:10.440]  It's all just sinking back into the jungle. Very, very sad to see that unfolding.
[1:35:10.440 --> 1:35:17.440]  Macron Camp, that's the globalist running against Marie Le Pen. Fear, high French abstention, people not voting.
[1:35:17.440 --> 1:35:23.440]  Rate could damage their chances, so everybody ready for a loss on that front, even though they're trying to cheat it.
[1:35:23.440 --> 1:35:28.440]  Paradise loss, idyllic French villages turned to far right, which just means they think a million or two
[1:35:28.440 --> 1:35:32.440]  new Islamists have every few years is enough. They don't like having their neighborhoods burned down,
[1:35:32.440 --> 1:35:35.440]  so they're far right because they have a survival mechanism.
[1:35:35.440 --> 1:35:42.440]  Trump and Putin yesterday discussed Syrian cooperation in phone call and a ceasefire they hope to develop.
[1:35:42.440 --> 1:35:47.440]  U.S. and Russian leader reportedly agreed to meet during G-20 and not have their own meeting.
[1:35:47.440 --> 1:35:53.440]  So Trump's been effectively intimidated by the media and John McCain not to meet with his Russian counterpart.
[1:35:53.440 --> 1:35:56.440]  Not a good thing, ladies and gentlemen. Not a good thing.
[1:35:56.440 --> 1:36:03.440]  Trump fires back. U.S. launches nuke missiles just days after Kim's nightmare firing of another missile.
[1:36:03.440 --> 1:36:12.440]  U.S. is testing ICBMs, and now we have U.S. commandos set to counter North Korean nuclear sites.
[1:36:12.440 --> 1:36:15.440]  Set to go in and take those out on the ground, talk about a dangerous mission.
[1:36:15.440 --> 1:36:22.440]  In order to do so, the U.S. is flying B-2 bombers over North Korea in nuke attack runs, test runs.
[1:36:22.440 --> 1:36:29.440]  China urges citizens in North Korea to return home, so has Japan, so things are escalating very, very quickly.
[1:36:29.440 --> 1:36:33.440]  China clamps on online news with new security rules, Fox News reports.
[1:36:33.440 --> 1:36:36.440]  We're getting more and more clamped-downs here as well.
[1:36:36.440 --> 1:36:39.440]  So that's just some of what's happening. We told you about this months ago.
[1:36:39.440 --> 1:36:42.440]  It's now the New York Post, so it's big breaking news here.
[1:36:42.440 --> 1:36:47.440]  Again, info wars. Get your news years, months or days before anybody else.
[1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:50.440]  People keep asking, what's our slogan?
[1:36:50.440 --> 1:36:55.440]  Frontlines of truth journalism, battling the establishment, trying to overthrow the corrupt establishment.
[1:36:55.440 --> 1:36:59.440]  Breitbart has all our terms that we've used. We are the resistance. Democrats now use that.
[1:36:59.440 --> 1:37:02.440]  Everything we do is copied precisely, but then twisted.
[1:37:02.440 --> 1:37:08.440]  Let me give you the new slogan for Twitter, for Facebook, for all our sites.
[1:37:08.440 --> 1:37:10.440]  I'm going to have them redesigned, all our pages.
[1:37:10.440 --> 1:37:14.440]  Our new tagline isn't just a war on for your mind. That'll always be our original.
[1:37:14.440 --> 1:37:17.440]  Because there's a war on for your mind. Info wars.
[1:37:17.440 --> 1:37:20.440]  Notice that's the term in the last few years is info war.
[1:37:20.440 --> 1:37:24.440]  I'm not bragging, it's just that's why they hate us. We're trailblazing because we're digging up the old technologies of humanity.
[1:37:24.440 --> 1:37:28.440]  The old social systems, the old understandings that they hope you forget.
[1:37:28.440 --> 1:37:31.440]  Because those that don't know history are going to repeat it.
[1:37:31.440 --> 1:37:37.440]  You notice that the enemies coming after us because they know we're trailblazers.
[1:37:37.440 --> 1:37:44.440]  So really our new slogan is get your news years, months or days before anybody else.
[1:37:44.440 --> 1:37:48.440]  Info wars.com. Info wars.com. You heard it here first.
[1:37:48.440 --> 1:37:53.440]  Info wars.com. The rest of the story. Let's rip off Paul Harvey. Good day.
[1:37:53.440 --> 1:37:57.440]  Info wars.com is getting to the bottom of the story. There you go.
[1:37:57.440 --> 1:38:00.440]  Info wars.com. To get to the bottom of the story. There's one.
[1:38:00.440 --> 1:38:08.440]  Info wars. I'm going to have liners for this. Info wars.com. Get your news days, weeks or years ahead of anybody else.
[1:38:08.440 --> 1:38:11.440]  That's the reality. So we told you about Kushner.
[1:38:11.440 --> 1:38:19.440]  Jared Kushner left a lot of his financial disclosure funded by George Soros, funded by Goldman Sachs, New York Post.
[1:38:19.440 --> 1:38:26.440]  Just like last hour I had Dr. Corsi on, but they had the Treasury confirming our two month plus old story that we broke exclusively.
[1:38:26.440 --> 1:38:36.440]  We're actually getting credit that with the documents, of course it was real, that they stole upwards of $300 billion from taxpayers to fund Obamacare out of Fannie Mae Freddie Mac.
[1:38:36.440 --> 1:38:44.440]  Boom. Took all the profit out of it. Stole it. Illegal. Not supposed to do that.
[1:38:44.440 --> 1:38:49.440]  Again, I'm not sitting or tooting our horn about all the stuff we break. Normally I'm just breaking the next story so fast.
[1:38:49.440 --> 1:38:54.440]  I don't even give ourselves credit, but we're fake. We're evil. I'm an actor. I don't mean what I'm saying.
[1:38:54.440 --> 1:39:08.440]  I guess that was a psychic oracle than the actor I play when we said Kushner's on the payroll of the Communist Chinese and the Goldman Sachs and of course George Soros, 200 plus mill, just from Sorosy.
[1:39:08.440 --> 1:39:15.440]  And I guess we're just psychic, getting those bank documents and those lawsuit sealed documents. I guess we just magically, that was just another thing I made up.
[1:39:15.440 --> 1:39:21.440]  Last Friday, telling you that they had a meeting that day, deciding to up the war in Afghanistan. It broke on Monday.
[1:39:21.440 --> 1:39:36.440]  Oh, I'm sorry. We're telling you with our guest, another great investigative journalist like Cernovich, that it was powers and others that were over there leaking the information.
[1:39:36.440 --> 1:39:42.440]  It just goes on and on and on. Now I'm going to go to our next guest, so I appreciate joining us here just a moment.
[1:39:42.440 --> 1:39:55.440]  But first off, we're doing a 30 hour broadcast. We're an hour and 39 minutes into it right now. We're going right through five, six o'clock tomorrow because Google and Adroll delisted us.
[1:39:55.440 --> 1:40:04.440]  We brought in $3.3 million. Sounds like a lot. You got 60, 70 people, a bunch of reporters, airline tickets, servers, legal stuff like that. It's nothing.
[1:40:04.440 --> 1:40:12.440]  We brought in $3.3 million last year. It was set via Adroll on the graphs to be $5 million this year.
[1:40:12.440 --> 1:40:20.440]  Off outside advertising, advertising products I sell on the internet to fund this operation.
[1:40:20.440 --> 1:40:25.440]  They took it away. That was the $3.3 million strangely enough. It was about $3.5.
[1:40:25.440 --> 1:40:33.440]  It was what we had budgeted this year to expand and set up a DC bureau, a London bureau, hire six, seven more people here, put in the infrastructure.
[1:40:33.440 --> 1:40:39.440]  They took that away. We've been trying the last four months since that happened to get that money back. We still haven't quite gotten there, but we're close.
[1:40:39.440 --> 1:40:49.440]  But as I knew, they hit us with the Federal Reserve board member lawsuit funded by and run by George Soros's founded law firm.
[1:40:49.440 --> 1:40:54.440]  Now, my lawyers say it's just purely to weigh us down and a policy stuff. I still got to defend against it.
[1:40:54.440 --> 1:40:57.440]  And they let me know too, others are on the way. More missiles are on their way.
[1:40:57.440 --> 1:41:03.440]  But we expect that because we are death dealing in the info order of these people.
[1:41:03.440 --> 1:41:10.440]  We are dominating. We are annihilating them. We are crushing these Nazi collaborators like Soros.
[1:41:10.440 --> 1:41:13.440]  They just can't believe someone will actually call their bluff and stand up against them.
[1:41:13.440 --> 1:41:18.440]  So the way you fund this is infowarstore.com. We have $5, $10, $20, $30.

[1:42:33.440 --> 1:42:41.440]  And DNA force is back in stock, but it's so limited the amounts of this, the BioPQQ we can get that it is a limited run and will sell out again.

[1:43:03.440 --> 1:43:09.440]  So I'm going to let him talk for about 10 minutes before I interrupt him with all the big topics, all the big stories that are taking place,
[1:43:09.440 --> 1:43:14.440]  all the big developments in nutraceuticals, all the different developments in the world.
[1:43:14.440 --> 1:43:18.440]  Just everything he's talked about for decades is now coming out in the news. It's amazing.
[1:43:18.440 --> 1:43:24.440]  So I wanted to have Dr. Grip on just to talk about some of the basic developments in the world today.
[1:43:24.440 --> 1:43:29.440]  And then in the next hour, we got a bunch of guests as well. But Dr. Grip, I'm going to give you the floor until we go to break.
[1:43:29.440 --> 1:43:32.440]  What's front and center on your screen today?
[1:43:32.440 --> 1:43:45.440]  Well, because you're doing your 30 hour special, you know, looking back, I was just thinking how much free speech has been suppressed in the natural medicine industry.
[1:43:45.440 --> 1:43:55.440]  Going back to the AMA, the creation of the American Medical Association, all of the corruption within the FDA, the Federal Drug Administration,
[1:43:55.440 --> 1:44:10.440]  all of the lobbying that's there, the suppression of natural medicine, the attack on doctors all across the world who have developed complete remission programs,
[1:44:10.440 --> 1:44:18.440]  whether it's one product or whether it's a system of detoxification, talking with these doctors all for years, for 20 years,
[1:44:18.440 --> 1:44:26.440]  you talking with the doctors for over 20 years, to seeing the amount of pressure on free speech,
[1:44:26.440 --> 1:44:35.440]  being able to say, we've worked with thousands of patients with this protocol and we've gotten 89, 90% success rates.
[1:44:35.440 --> 1:44:43.440]  Why on earth aren't these technologies, aren't these systems being placed in all hospitals today?
[1:44:43.440 --> 1:44:46.440]  Why aren't doctors being educated on natural medicine?
[1:44:46.440 --> 1:44:48.440]  Why is there such a suppression?
[1:44:48.440 --> 1:44:59.440]  Why is there such an attack from the FTC on regular consumers out there that are using products, not necessarily product manufacturing companies,
[1:44:59.440 --> 1:45:10.440]  but consumers, I mean companies are now, the FDA is actually issuing warning letters to companies because consumers are going online
[1:45:10.440 --> 1:45:18.440]  and placing five-star reviews and talking about the success that they had using the product.
[1:45:18.440 --> 1:45:26.440]  I mean, and being censored from that is, you know, doctors have been killed, doctors have been put out of business,
[1:45:26.440 --> 1:45:34.440]  doctors are in massive amounts of lawsuits, just like it is with the independent media out there,
[1:45:34.440 --> 1:45:39.440]  but natural medicine, chiropractic, massage therapy, colon hydro therapy,
[1:45:39.440 --> 1:45:47.440]  all of the springs, the healing springs and spas that were closed down in the early 1900s
[1:45:47.440 --> 1:45:55.440]  that were used where people would go and drink pure clean water and fast for a few days to get rid of whatever condition they were suffering from.
[1:45:55.440 --> 1:45:57.440]  You know, all of these things are being suppressed.
[1:45:57.440 --> 1:46:03.440]  Of course, we know why they're being suppressed because there's so much money in pharmaceuticals,
[1:46:03.440 --> 1:46:11.440]  and that's what I was really hoping that this administration would do something about that, would address the root cause of the problem.
[1:46:11.440 --> 1:46:14.440]  But Alex, you know, it's always been we the people.
[1:46:14.440 --> 1:46:18.440]  If you look at all of the change that's taken place in the last 15, 20 years,
[1:46:18.440 --> 1:46:22.440]  all of your listeners that continue to grow on a daily basis,
[1:46:22.440 --> 1:46:30.440]  you know, all the attacks that we're getting on a daily, weekly basis, it is becoming mainstream.
[1:46:30.440 --> 1:46:35.440]  And thank God that people are waking up and they are looking for answers.
[1:46:35.440 --> 1:46:37.440]  They've seen their grandparents die.
[1:46:37.440 --> 1:46:41.440]  They've seen their parents that are on multiple pharmaceuticals,
[1:46:41.440 --> 1:46:47.440]  and it's all about addressing the root cause of the problem, which we try to lay out to people.
[1:46:47.440 --> 1:46:53.440]  If you understand that there's fluoride and chlorine and bromine and a million other chemicals in the water supply,
[1:46:53.440 --> 1:46:58.440]  you know that you need to either get a filtration system or drink clean water.
[1:46:58.440 --> 1:47:04.440]  You know that the food supply is contaminated because we've gone over in detail all of the compounds that are in the food
[1:47:04.440 --> 1:47:10.440]  that you need to look out for, the artificial colors and sweeteners and high fructose corn syrup and then genetically modified foods.
[1:47:10.440 --> 1:47:19.440]  And you can make those conscious decisions, start making those decisions and implementing those things into your life on a regular basis.
[1:47:19.440 --> 1:47:30.440]  Just every single decision that you make, it's a combination of all those 20, 30, 40 health giving decisions
[1:47:30.440 --> 1:47:35.440]  that are going to lead up to the big changes that take place in your life.
[1:47:35.440 --> 1:47:41.440]  And by the way, I don't want to be too negative all the time. We suddenly see Forbes, Wall Street Journal admitting,
[1:47:41.440 --> 1:47:44.440]  diet drinks make you fat, eat your brain.
[1:47:44.440 --> 1:47:50.440]  Serotonin reuptake inhibitors, Prozac type drugs, eat your brain, cause aneurysms, cranial bleeding.
[1:47:50.440 --> 1:47:54.440]  It's suddenly everything you've been talking about, and Dr. Blalock's been talking about,
[1:47:54.440 --> 1:48:00.440]  and Dr. Wallach saying, have uncooked fat diets. It's burned fat that's deadly, trans fat,
[1:48:00.440 --> 1:48:04.440]  and it makes you smarter, your brain lasts longer, you don't have the arterial problems.
[1:48:04.440 --> 1:48:08.440]  And everything you were saying, you know, in your cancer clinics 20 years ago,
[1:48:08.440 --> 1:48:13.440]  is about vitamin C intervenously, ozone intervenously, stuff you were pioneering.
[1:48:13.440 --> 1:48:18.440]  The media makes fun of you and only looks at one of your certificates for chiropractic, not all the others,
[1:48:18.440 --> 1:48:24.440]  as if chiropractic is bad. Everything you've been talking about for 20 years is now the mainline elite clinics
[1:48:24.440 --> 1:48:27.440]  that the MDs are using with three degrees.
[1:48:27.440 --> 1:48:34.440]  That's right, and that's the good news. The question is, are they, you know, at what point are they going to lay off,
[1:48:34.440 --> 1:48:42.440]  or what point are they going to be letting people, individual consumers, talk about how they've gotten better
[1:48:42.440 --> 1:48:47.440]  through detoxification, and through cleansing, and through reactivating their body's self-healing mechanism,
[1:48:47.440 --> 1:48:54.440]  and through taking the supplements that InfoWars life supplements are not just supplements that we go out
[1:48:54.440 --> 1:48:58.440]  and we copy everybody else online about.
[1:48:58.440 --> 1:49:05.440]  When we look at the root cause of disease, and we still study that 20 years later, it's all about that.
[1:49:05.440 --> 1:49:12.440]  No one else is out there doing that. The research companies that are out there researching pharmaceutical man-made compounds,
[1:49:12.440 --> 1:49:18.440]  what we're looking at is how does the body heal naturally through sunlight, through clean water, through clean food,
[1:49:18.440 --> 1:49:24.440]  through boosting the immune system. Now the University of California out there came out and said,
[1:49:24.440 --> 1:49:27.440]  fasting for 72 hours, completely regenerated.
[1:49:27.440 --> 1:49:32.440]  You always said do it for three to four days, and let me expand. I've lost almost 70, 80 pounds.
[1:49:32.440 --> 1:49:36.440]  I still have a super stressful life. I work out less and am in better shape.
[1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:40.440]  I never say I'm a beach boy, but I look like a beach boy compared to what I looked for four or five years ago,
[1:49:40.440 --> 1:49:44.440]  and it was all the nutraceuticals, and people get them, and we get five star reviews by the thousands,
[1:49:44.440 --> 1:49:51.440]  and then we get complaints in New York and stuff to their expector general, calling the big third party sites that are respected,
[1:49:51.440 --> 1:49:55.440]  and they just laugh because we really do have thousands of five star reviews per product,
[1:49:55.440 --> 1:50:01.440]  and it totally freaks people out that they can't believe that Mother Nature is this powerful.
[1:50:01.440 --> 1:50:06.440]  They are so upset at this, Dr. Group, that I've gone from looking like Jabba the Hutt five years ago,
[1:50:06.440 --> 1:50:13.440]  to when I'm sitting there with my shirt off, I look like Fred Flintstone, but my belly's 10% of what it used to be.
[1:50:13.440 --> 1:50:16.440]  It's almost gone.
[1:50:16.440 --> 1:50:24.440]  Well, it's identifying, what we do is we identify what's currently going on in politics and behind the scenes in the government,
[1:50:24.440 --> 1:50:30.440]  and what's going on with the suppression of natural medicine, and we look at what we're seeing major,
[1:50:30.440 --> 1:50:35.440]  I just say epidemic all the time, but just what massive amounts of people are suffering from.
[1:50:35.440 --> 1:50:41.440]  So you identify the fact that there's massive amounts of fluoride and chlorine and bromine in the food,
[1:50:41.440 --> 1:50:46.440]  and what does that lead to? It leads to massive iodine deficiency all over the globe.
[1:50:46.440 --> 1:50:48.440]  And people that have that tend to be obese.
[1:50:48.440 --> 1:50:51.440]  Why is being toxic tend to make you so obese and blow up?
[1:50:51.440 --> 1:50:54.440]  Is that your cells trying to hold water so they don't get toxified?
[1:50:54.440 --> 1:50:59.440]  Explain that to me, and why are allergies globally off the charts and only getting worse?
[1:50:59.440 --> 1:51:01.440]  I mean, they're getting crippling for most people I know.
[1:51:01.440 --> 1:51:12.440]  Stay there, Dr. Grubs. Stay with us.

[1:54:18.440 --> 1:54:21.440]  Dr. Group of the Global Healing Center is our guest.
[1:54:21.440 --> 1:54:24.440]  Amazing guy, GlobalHealingCenter.com.
[1:54:24.440 --> 1:54:26.440]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[1:54:55.440 --> 1:54:59.440]  I did research and I went on the online big health sites
[1:54:59.440 --> 1:55:06.440]  and I looked for who was the most respected and who advised big companies on product lines.
[1:55:06.440 --> 1:55:08.440]  Whole Foods, you name it.
[1:55:08.440 --> 1:55:11.440]  And Group, as the media says, is not the only guy that advises us.
[1:55:11.440 --> 1:55:14.440]  We have three of the biggest organic makers in the country.
[1:55:14.440 --> 1:55:20.440]  A lot of our products are just private labeled, best-selling brands that are sold in health food stores for decades.
[1:55:20.440 --> 1:55:25.440]  Like our child ease is just private labeled, calm child.
[1:55:25.440 --> 1:55:27.440]  Things like that.
[1:55:27.440 --> 1:55:29.440]  Knockout is something I came up with.
[1:55:29.440 --> 1:55:36.440]  I said, is it safe Dr. Group to take L-trip to fan, malaria in root, melatonin, lemon balm, chamomile,
[1:55:36.440 --> 1:55:41.440]  and a few other known ingredients in Mother Nature that are associated with better sleep,
[1:55:41.440 --> 1:55:45.440]  fuse them together in one pill, sell it for the same price as a bottle of melatonin,
[1:55:45.440 --> 1:55:48.440]  that's the same dose for a little bit of pill.
[1:55:48.440 --> 1:55:52.440]  We have the same dose in there, but it's a big pill and it's revolutionized.
[1:55:52.440 --> 1:55:59.440]  It doesn't make us a lot of money because it's so low in price, but we sell a ton of it and people are crazy about it.
[1:55:59.440 --> 1:56:05.440]  So some of the stuff I came up with, checked with Group, he goes, oh no, they all work together naturally.
[1:56:05.440 --> 1:56:12.440]  Because I found out I took L-trip to fan and melatonin helped me and I said, why not put seven other things with it?
[1:56:12.440 --> 1:56:14.440]  So it really, really works great.
[1:56:14.440 --> 1:56:17.440]  Obviously this is all seen as safe, but consult your physician for you to take any of this.
[1:56:17.440 --> 1:56:22.440]  There are a lot of game changers, but a lot of it Group developed the Special X2, other products,
[1:56:22.440 --> 1:56:25.440]  and we've done all this together and it helps funder operation.
[1:56:25.440 --> 1:56:32.440]  Knockouts $15, folks, at $19.95, it's a crazy special, but everything is 20% to 30% off today.
[1:56:32.440 --> 1:56:38.440]  A lot of items have free shipping. Check it all out, infowarstore.com or AAA-2533139.
[1:56:38.440 --> 1:56:42.440]  Dr. Group, where do you see this going?
[1:56:42.440 --> 1:56:46.440]  They're trying to censor us, they're openly trying to shut down InfoWars, they've tried to shut you down before,
[1:56:46.440 --> 1:56:49.440]  everything you've talked about literally is being admitted now.
[1:56:49.440 --> 1:56:54.440]  I think we've already kind of passed the tipping point and the dinosaur system doesn't realize it's dead already.
[1:56:54.440 --> 1:56:57.440]  Or am I being too optimistic?
[1:56:57.440 --> 1:57:00.440]  Well, it's always good to be optimistic, you know, we have to stay optimistic.
[1:57:00.440 --> 1:57:08.440]  And I think that the more education that we give people, the more people wake up and the more people realize
[1:57:08.440 --> 1:57:14.440]  that it's the people that are going to create the change, just like what happened with the labeling of the GMOs.
[1:57:14.440 --> 1:57:21.440]  And recently, I was on the show and we were talking about the fungus epidemic and we both got, you know, blasted for that.
[1:57:21.440 --> 1:57:29.440]  Well, just yesterday, the Philadelphia Tribune came out with a main article that said fatal fungus linked to death, what you need to know.
[1:57:29.440 --> 1:57:39.440]  And anyone can now go on the CDC website and the CDC is now claiming that there's a new strain of a drug-resistant yeast infection that's been spreading below.
[1:57:39.440 --> 1:57:47.440]  Well, let me just stop you. Let me just stop you. It's known at clinics and doctors I know everywhere that fungus and mold is killing everybody in Austin.
[1:57:47.440 --> 1:57:56.440]  It's blowing around everywhere. It's out of control. I met two cops, one of which died, the other which had medical retirement but still did bodyguard work.
[1:57:56.440 --> 1:58:02.440]  They went in one crack house that had a deadly mold in it and it almost killed them both, one exposure.
[1:58:02.440 --> 1:58:10.440]  And again, it's mutating. Do we know why it's mutating? Because I read all the time about people getting brain tumors from mold or fungus now.
[1:58:10.440 --> 1:58:13.440]  What is going on?
[1:58:13.440 --> 1:58:20.440]  Well, we just know that it can travel long distances. Some of it is a spore so it can sit dormant for a long period of time.
[1:58:20.440 --> 1:58:25.440]  I don't think anybody really knows the true answer to why that's taking place.
[1:58:25.440 --> 1:58:28.440]  It's killing all the bats. Stay there. We're back at 70 seconds. Two fiber minutes and I'm going to shut up.
[1:58:28.440 --> 1:58:32.440]  I'm going to ask you because you just mentioned the Philadelphia news. We just pulled it up. Just what you said.
[1:58:32.440 --> 1:58:39.440]  It's in the news 50 times a day. Scientists saying it's mutating. It's killing people. It's killing animals. What is going on?
[1:58:39.440 --> 1:58:46.440]  It's hurting me. I mean, I want and then the media, yeah, wrote big hit pieces saying we're cooks because we don't want to die.
[1:58:46.440 --> 1:58:50.440]  I mean, you know, and we sell an antifungal that's just like a probiotic.
[1:58:50.440 --> 1:58:56.440]  That by the way, I've got a bunch of crew members that had irritable bowel till they took it. It's gone.
[1:58:56.440 --> 1:59:03.440]  Today we call it bone broth. And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets.
[1:59:03.440 --> 1:59:07.440]  A processed junk. We are now introducing caveman by infolwarslife.com.
[1:59:07.440 --> 1:59:17.440]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom and seven total primal super foods in a single great tasting formula.
[1:59:17.440 --> 1:59:23.440]  Caveman. It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[1:59:23.440 --> 1:59:29.440]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture them. Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[1:59:29.440 --> 1:59:34.440]  You use the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you use the bones for strength.
[1:59:34.440 --> 1:59:39.440]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[1:59:39.440 --> 1:59:42.440]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[1:59:42.440 --> 1:59:49.440]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were.
[1:59:49.440 --> 1:59:55.440]  And this is a big part of it. I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself at infolwarslife.com today.
[1:59:58.440 --> 2:00:01.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:01.440 --> 2:00:05.440]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[2:00:31.440 --> 2:00:49.440]  I go to an allergy doctor because Austin is the capital of allergies. Tennessee is real bad to areas of Tennessee like Knoxville.
[2:00:49.440 --> 2:00:54.440]  But you can debate it, but they say Austin is the worst in the country because there are so many different types of plants.
[2:00:54.440 --> 2:01:02.440]  And in the buildings in the big cities next to the jungle that Austin is, mold and fungus are just breeding, mutating.
[2:01:02.440 --> 2:01:09.440]  They believe GMO crops are mutating with it. That's been confirmed with the different floras now mixing together.
[2:01:09.440 --> 2:01:12.440]  Because you start splicing other plants and animals with other plants.
[2:01:12.440 --> 2:01:17.440]  It opens them up out of their species to be able to basically mutate faster.
[2:01:17.440 --> 2:01:20.440]  But there's a Philadelphia Tribune fungus linked to deaths, what you need to know.
[2:01:20.440 --> 2:01:26.440]  I mean, it's everywhere and I go to the clinic and it's people basically almost dying from fungus.
[2:01:26.440 --> 2:01:30.440]  And when the mold goes up almost everybody I know has huge headaches. You can't breathe.
[2:01:30.440 --> 2:01:39.440]  I've talked about this. Then they have Vox and others say, Jones and his doctor group make up a fungus epidemic and happen to have a pill to treat it.
[2:01:39.440 --> 2:01:45.440]  What? Just like probiotics. Yeah, we sell a high quality probiotic. Things we need, things we use.
[2:01:45.440 --> 2:01:52.440]  And then they make a joke about antifungal when Bill Gates admits most of his new funding is into antifunguses for the gut.
[2:01:52.440 --> 2:01:55.440]  He believes drugs in that area will be the biggest seller in the future.
[2:01:55.440 --> 2:02:01.440]  So Bill Gates does it and it's okay. But we do. We're bad, Dr. Group. What is causing it to get so crazy?
[2:02:01.440 --> 2:02:06.440]  I mean, 20 years ago, almost nobody had allergies. Now it's epidemic. What's going on?
[2:02:06.440 --> 2:02:10.440]  Well, I try to look at that. I think a lot of different factors.
[2:02:10.440 --> 2:02:16.440]  Number one, people's bodies are toxic. Their pH levels are off, which means their body is ripe.
[2:02:16.440 --> 2:02:22.440]  It's damp. It's diseased. It's dark. They have a lot of cells that aren't working at 100%.
[2:02:22.440 --> 2:02:26.440]  Their immune systems are suppressed because of everything that they're exposed to.
[2:02:26.440 --> 2:02:27.440]  We're rundown.
[2:02:27.440 --> 2:02:36.440]  So yeah, exactly. With all the amounts of stress that people are under right now, their immune systems are working at 30, 40, 50%.
[2:02:36.440 --> 2:02:45.440]  So you're not able to attack the fungus, which again leads back to keeping yourself clean, eating clean food, detoxifying yourself on a regular basis.
[2:02:45.440 --> 2:02:50.440]  The fungus out there, there's a lot of different types that can mix with each other.
[2:02:50.440 --> 2:02:54.440]  It's basically like a plague that's going on.
[2:02:54.440 --> 2:03:00.440]  They admit most of the bats are dying from fungus.
[2:03:00.440 --> 2:03:06.440]  And with people, one of the main things we found is that doctors don't know how to diagnose it.
[2:03:06.440 --> 2:03:12.440]  They're not testing for it. I mean, if there was a standard test that we could run on everybody, a blood test and a urine test, let's say,
[2:03:12.440 --> 2:03:20.440]  to test for a broad range of fungus and mold and yeast, I'm sure that the majority of people out there would come back positive,
[2:03:20.440 --> 2:03:23.440]  especially for Candida species and other species out there.
[2:03:23.440 --> 2:03:25.440]  So I think it's just not being tested for.
[2:03:25.440 --> 2:03:32.440]  Most people that I talk to never even know they have it. They suffer for years and years and years and years.
[2:03:32.440 --> 2:03:41.440]  And they go through massive amounts of different pharmaceuticals, antibiotic regimens, and then they actually find out that they have it.
[2:03:41.440 --> 2:03:46.440]  But regardless of what anyone's dealing with, Alex, you could pretty much trace everything back to a healthy gut.
[2:03:46.440 --> 2:03:53.440]  And that's why with the biome defense, taking care of your endocrine system with the X2, the biome defense,
[2:03:53.440 --> 2:03:57.440]  all of the supplements that you need, the winter sun, vitamin D.
[2:03:57.440 --> 2:04:00.440]  Is our micro ZX any fun even back in?
[2:04:00.440 --> 2:04:01.440]  What's that?
[2:04:01.440 --> 2:04:04.440]  Are we still sold out of the micro ZX?
[2:04:04.440 --> 2:04:08.440]  You are sold out of the micro ZX. We're working as hard as we possibly can.
[2:04:08.440 --> 2:04:11.440]  People are understanding what's out there and people want it.
[2:04:11.440 --> 2:04:15.440]  We're ramping up production. We're about to move into our new manufacturing facility.
[2:04:15.440 --> 2:04:23.440]  Our moving in this month, which is going to give us the ability to produce 10 times, 15 times the amount of production.
[2:04:23.440 --> 2:04:26.440]  That's why they're so scared because we're exploding and they know it.
[2:04:26.440 --> 2:04:31.440]  Right. We're helping people and helping people wakes people up because you're decalcified.
[2:04:31.440 --> 2:04:34.440]  Oh, you know how much more people love us when they get X2 and it changes their life?
[2:04:34.440 --> 2:04:40.440]  I mean, this is real stuff. They're hitting us with all the bad halogens. We've got the good halogen. It's a win-win.
[2:04:40.440 --> 2:04:45.440]  Right. Because you understand what's causing your problem and that's what should be taught to everybody.
[2:04:45.440 --> 2:04:51.440]  Understand that you do have a self-healing mechanism that you do not have to run to the doctor's office for everything.
[2:04:51.440 --> 2:04:55.440]  I've gotten so much better since I took the micro ZX. It's just amazing.
[2:04:55.440 --> 2:04:59.440]  But I gotta tell you, it hasn't knocked it out of my sinus though. So we need to talk about something to do that.
[2:04:59.440 --> 2:05:02.440]  Dr. Group, thank you so much. We love you. You're so amazing.
[2:05:02.440 --> 2:05:05.440]  We'll be right back. Stay with us. Thank you.
[2:05:05.440 --> 2:05:09.440]  What exactly is political correctness and why is it being pushed on the American public?
[2:05:09.440 --> 2:05:15.440]  Well, political correctness is simply a form of psychological manipulation the government uses to control public opinion.
[2:05:15.440 --> 2:05:19.440]  By controlling your opinions, the establishment gets you to not only agree with their agenda,
[2:05:19.440 --> 2:05:24.440]  but to also ensure that your government-created viewpoint also influences others in ripple effect.
[2:05:24.440 --> 2:05:27.440]  And this is how the power elite and the government stay in power.
[2:05:27.440 --> 2:05:31.440]  They use psychological manipulation to turn the public into obedient sheeple.
[2:05:31.440 --> 2:05:34.440]  And over time, we lose our ability to distinguish reality from deception.
[2:05:34.440 --> 2:05:38.440]  But how does political correctness and other deliberate deceptions work?
[2:05:38.440 --> 2:05:42.440]  Well, first, the establishment saturates mass media with their agenda they're trying to push
[2:05:42.440 --> 2:05:48.440]  until it invades every aspect of popular culture and is accepted as truth, such as global warming, for example.
[2:05:48.440 --> 2:05:52.440]  Then the establishment suppresses any counterarguments through their agenda by calling critics
[2:05:52.440 --> 2:05:57.440]  kooky, nutjobs, racists, or, in the case of man-made climate change, climate deniers.
[2:05:57.440 --> 2:06:02.440]  You can learn more about this tyranny over the minds of men at infowars.com, PrismPlanet.tv,
[2:06:02.440 --> 2:06:05.440]  and our YouTube channel, Resistance News. This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[2:06:05.440 --> 2:06:11.440]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at infowars.com.
[2:06:11.440 --> 2:06:16.440]  Research across the board is clear. When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream
[2:06:16.440 --> 2:06:18.440]  and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[2:06:18.440 --> 2:06:23.440]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health
[2:06:23.440 --> 2:06:25.440]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[2:06:25.440 --> 2:06:29.440]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[2:06:29.440 --> 2:06:32.440]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide, instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[2:06:32.440 --> 2:06:36.440]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times
[2:06:36.440 --> 2:06:39.440]  to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[2:06:39.440 --> 2:06:44.440]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol,
[2:06:44.440 --> 2:06:48.440]  peppermint oil, iodine, nano-silver, and more, due to requests from listers
[2:06:48.440 --> 2:06:52.440]  who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.
[2:06:52.440 --> 2:06:55.440]  We have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is spearmint-free.
[2:06:55.440 --> 2:06:59.440]  Learn more about the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more

[2:07:29.440 --> 2:07:34.440]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older,
[2:07:34.440 --> 2:07:37.440]  more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[2:07:37.440 --> 2:07:41.440]  The best job you can to purify your air is to purify your air.
[2:07:41.440 --> 2:07:45.440]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things
[2:07:45.440 --> 2:07:49.440]  that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[2:07:49.440 --> 2:07:51.440]  The general public doesn't.
[2:07:51.440 --> 2:07:55.440]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[2:07:55.440 --> 2:07:59.440]  Replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.

[2:08:38.440 --> 2:08:45.440]  Alright, Catherine Austin Fitz worked at very, very high levels inside the federal government.
[2:08:45.440 --> 2:08:47.440]  I think our computer is having a malfunction.
[2:08:47.440 --> 2:08:49.440]  I think we're doing that on purpose there.
[2:08:49.440 --> 2:08:51.440]  It's going to make me have a seizure here in a second.
[2:08:51.440 --> 2:08:59.440]  But we are in the middle of our 30-hour global live transmission in defense of western renaissance,
[2:08:59.440 --> 2:09:05.440]  of true liberal western values, that means low taxes, religious freedom, national sovereignty,
[2:09:05.440 --> 2:09:09.440]  against the neocon, rhino-republican Democrat establishment.
[2:09:09.440 --> 2:09:13.440]  Donald Trump was doing really good for nationalism, killing TPP,
[2:09:13.440 --> 2:09:19.440]  getting us to be proud to be Americans again, and then he started going off sideways around day 70
[2:09:19.440 --> 2:09:26.440]  as soon as Steve Bannon got basically taken to the woodshed.
[2:09:26.440 --> 2:09:31.440]  Catherine Austin Fitz is president of Solari Group, publisher of the Solari Report,
[2:09:31.440 --> 2:09:35.440]  which is a beautiful magazine and then full of information.
[2:09:35.440 --> 2:09:39.440]  She served as a managing director and member of the board of directors of the Wall Street Investment Bank,
[2:09:39.440 --> 2:09:43.440]  Dylan Reed and Co. Inc., an assistant secretary of housing and federal housing commissioner
[2:09:43.440 --> 2:09:47.440]  at the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development in the first Bush administration
[2:09:47.440 --> 2:09:49.440]  and was the president of Hamilton Securities Group.
[2:09:49.440 --> 2:09:54.440]  Catherine has designed and closed over $25 billion of transactions and investments to date
[2:09:54.440 --> 2:09:59.440]  and has led portfolio investment strategy of $300 billion of financial assets and liabilities.
[2:09:59.440 --> 2:10:04.440]  Catherine graduated from University of Pennsylvania and Warlton School with her MBA
[2:10:04.440 --> 2:10:09.440]  and studied Mandarin Chinese at the Chinese University in Hong Kong, Solari.com.
[2:10:09.440 --> 2:10:14.440]  I was thinking, we got to get her on. It's been a couple of years, just time flashes by.
[2:10:14.440 --> 2:10:19.440]  Can you get her on every month if she'll do it? I sent crew out to interview her. You name it.
[2:10:19.440 --> 2:10:24.440]  But it's great to have her on because just today we've learned that this Treasury Secretary,
[2:10:24.440 --> 2:10:28.440]  Mnuchin, admits that our reports from Dr. Corsi two months ago
[2:10:28.440 --> 2:10:32.440]  that they've raided Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under Obama to pay for Obamacare.
[2:10:32.440 --> 2:10:36.440]  That's true. She's an expert on that, obviously being with HUD.
[2:10:36.440 --> 2:10:40.440]  And we've got this teetering economy. We've got Trump trying to prop it up.
[2:10:40.440 --> 2:10:46.440]  You've got Jared Kushner on the Soros payroll. You've got just all this craziness going on,
[2:10:46.440 --> 2:10:52.440]  all these talk of war coming up. It's just a crazy, crazy time to be alive.
[2:10:52.440 --> 2:10:59.440]  So I appreciate her coming on to discuss all this, just the state of the world, where she sees this going.
[2:10:59.440 --> 2:11:01.440]  Catherine, great to have you with us.
[2:11:01.440 --> 2:11:04.440]  Alex, it's great to be on. You're doing great things.
[2:11:04.440 --> 2:11:08.440]  You're doing great things. Where do you want to start? I mean, you're the banking expert here.
[2:11:08.440 --> 2:11:12.440]  State of the world, what's happening with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, what you think of Trump?
[2:11:12.440 --> 2:11:14.440]  I mean, what's your view?
[2:11:14.440 --> 2:11:19.440]  So hold up the cover of our wrap up. Can you hold up the cover of our wrap up?
[2:11:19.440 --> 2:11:21.440]  Yes, I can. It's right here.
[2:11:21.440 --> 2:11:24.440]  Okay. So what's the question it asks?
[2:11:24.440 --> 2:11:34.440]  It asks, can a new administration preserve a prosperous economy without more debt, crime, and war with a dove on the front?
[2:11:34.440 --> 2:11:44.440]  Exactly. So the question is, Donald Trump became president and walked into a machinery that is totally dependent on a war economy.
[2:11:44.440 --> 2:11:52.440]  And what has happened is, you know, he was doing great for about 70 days and now he's done a variety of U-turns.
[2:11:52.440 --> 2:11:58.440]  And it looks like the war economy has taken over. Do you remember my red button story?
[2:11:58.440 --> 2:12:02.440]  Yes. Let's tell the red button story again. You haven't told it in a few years here.
[2:12:02.440 --> 2:12:09.440]  I was talking to a group of wonderful people called Spiritual Frontiers Foundation International, and this was in 2000.
[2:12:09.440 --> 2:12:20.440]  And we were talking about the congressional testimony on allegations of the intelligence agencies selling narcotics into South Central LA.
[2:12:20.440 --> 2:12:32.440]  So I said to them, you know, at the time, a Department of Justice spokesperson told a report I was working with that the U.S. economy launders $500 billion to a trillion a year of all dirty money.
[2:12:32.440 --> 2:12:43.440]  So I said to this wonderful group of spiritually evolved people, what would happen if we stopped being the global leader on laundering $500 billion to a trillion a year of money?
[2:12:43.440 --> 2:12:51.440]  And we had a little conversation and they said, we know we have trouble keeping the stock market up. That money would go to London or Zurich or Hong Kong.
[2:12:51.440 --> 2:12:58.440]  And we have trouble financing the government deficit. And I said, okay, let's pretend there's a big red button up here on the lectern.
[2:12:58.440 --> 2:13:10.440]  And if you push that button, you can stop all hard narcotics trafficking in your county, your city, your town, your state tomorrow, thus offending the people who control $500 billion to a trillion of all dirty money.
[2:13:10.440 --> 2:13:17.440]  And out of 100 people dedicated to evolving our society spiritually, the point of the conference, only one would push the button.
[2:13:17.440 --> 2:13:23.440]  So I said to the other 99 now, why would you not push the button? And they said, we don't want our government checks to stop.
[2:13:23.440 --> 2:13:28.440]  We don't want our taxes to go up and we don't want our IRAs and 401Ks to go down.
[2:13:28.440 --> 2:13:37.440]  So the whole issue for the Trump administration is the genius of corruption because they get us into a system like cancer that's into our heart.
[2:13:37.440 --> 2:13:45.440]  You cut it out, you bleed to death. I mean, that's kind of a layman way of saying it, but it's really the mystery of evil.
[2:13:45.440 --> 2:13:59.440]  The U.S. economy is addicted to the war economy and to dirty money. And you can't drain the swamp in Washington unless 3100 counties in America are willing to drain the swamp one county at a time.
[2:13:59.440 --> 2:14:02.440]  Because the swamp is from sea to shining sea.
[2:14:02.440 --> 2:14:12.440]  So the answer is this is very profound. We are the swamp. Drudge says that the swamp is draining Trump. Isn't it just that we are the swamp?
[2:14:12.440 --> 2:14:21.440]  The swamp is draining Trump. Trump can drain a lot of swamp from Washington on any issue where he has an 80% or higher consensus.
[2:14:21.440 --> 2:14:26.440]  But he doesn't have an 80% higher consensus, which makes him a prisoner of the machinery.
[2:14:26.440 --> 2:14:36.440]  So the question is how do you get out of that box? How do you change things? The way you get out of it is through the budget, you delegate the information on the budget to 3100 counties,
[2:14:36.440 --> 2:14:43.440]  and 3100 counties help you re-engineer that budget one county at a time. You can't re-engineer it in Washington.
[2:14:43.440 --> 2:14:54.440]  So if we take a look at the healthcare system, if you look at all the constituencies who are subject to the healthcare budget, none of them are willing to buy into an economic situation
[2:14:54.440 --> 2:15:04.440]  or solution. So that's why the Senate and the House are just going around and around and around, because their constituencies won't buy into something that works.
[2:15:04.440 --> 2:15:17.440]  That's why if you go to my website at Salaria.com, I have a new commentary up called That Pesky Constitution about the President's comments on the Constitution earlier this week.
[2:15:17.440 --> 2:15:32.440]  And in it, there's a link to a letter to my Congresswoman where I basically say, here's what you do. You tell all the federal agencies to publish all of their budgets on a place-based basis so we can read them by county,
[2:15:32.440 --> 2:15:41.440]  and you start to engage the general population in real solutions. Now, you've covered this so you know. The number one problem in the budget, what is it?
[2:15:41.440 --> 2:15:58.440]  $11.5 trillion is missing from the federal government. So let's go back to 1998. For the last 20-plus years, what we've done, Alex, is the taxpayers have put money in and they've paid, you know, for money disappearing out the back door,
[2:15:58.440 --> 2:16:08.440]  and those assets are owned by private parties. Then they've paid $6 trillion for war in the Middle East, but the private assets picked up through that are owned by private parties.
[2:16:08.440 --> 2:16:16.440]  And then finally, they've paid for all this technology through the black budget, and all that technology is owned by private parties.
[2:16:16.440 --> 2:16:24.440]  So if I keep putting money in a pot but the money disappears or goes to finance somebody's else's assets, I'm never going to be able to get it in balance.
[2:16:24.440 --> 2:16:38.440]  And with $11.5 trillion missing from the federal government and the federal government refusing to comply with the laws about financial statements, we're in a situation now where we've had a financial coup d'etat, the money's stolen,
[2:16:38.440 --> 2:16:46.440]  and now everyone in Congress doesn't want to turn to the American people and say, you know something, the money we're going to use for nursing homes, it's gone.
[2:16:46.440 --> 2:16:55.440]  Exactly. So how's the clock ticking? How long do we have? What happens if this doesn't fundamentally get changed?
[2:16:55.440 --> 2:17:07.440]  Well, in theory, you can keep this going forever. It's a matter of, it's a military and intelligence question of whether you can apply enough force domestically and internationally to hold it together forever.
[2:17:07.440 --> 2:17:19.440]  In theory, it's possible. That's what I've called, they've held it together with what I call the slow burn, but you're using a system that both internationally and domestically requires more and more and more force.
[2:17:19.440 --> 2:17:26.440]  And as you can see, you're getting a pushback all over the world. That's what the Trump election was about. That's what Brexit was about.
[2:17:26.440 --> 2:17:41.440]  You're getting pushback and it's very much draining the productivity and system. That's why the pushback on the Trump election was so hard. You basically decimated productivity of individual people and a lot of small business.
[2:17:41.440 --> 2:17:48.440]  Sure, so people are rebelling against globalism, but then they compromise whoever we put in because, you know, the swamp is there.
[2:17:48.440 --> 2:18:01.440]  They're not, they're not rebelling about against globalization. Interestingly enough, globalization wants to happen for market purposes. They're, they are pushing back against the system, which is centralizing control.
[2:18:01.440 --> 2:18:06.440]  Sure, I meant since the centralized global control system, not through globalism.
[2:18:06.440 --> 2:18:19.440]  Right, exactly. So, so what they're against is illegal. Basically, the federal government, I told you the story, I went to see the chief of staff to the chairman of the subcommittee that oversees HUD.
[2:18:19.440 --> 2:18:27.440]  And it was, I think, 2001. And I said to her, this is before the appropriation bills were voted out.
[2:18:27.440 --> 2:18:36.440]  And it was somebody I didn't know and the person said, what do you think is going on at the Department of Housing and Agriculture Development? And I said, I don't know. What do you think is going on?
[2:18:36.440 --> 2:18:42.440]  And they looked me dead in the eye and said, HUD is being run as a criminal enterprise. And I said, I don't disagree.
[2:18:42.440 --> 2:18:55.440]  But for HUD to be run as a criminal enterprise to engage in all the mortgage fraud that created the housing bubble, it had to be run as a criminal enterprise by the Department of Justice, the U.S. Treasury,
[2:18:55.440 --> 2:19:00.440]  the New York Fed member banks and the big defense contractors that ran HUD.
[2:19:00.440 --> 2:19:10.440]  So you're talking about a machinery that is engaged in financing a reality which is completely different than the official reality.
[2:19:10.440 --> 2:19:19.440]  And the way I say it is, we've got one budget that is financing two civilizations and the second civilization is completely invisible and non-transparent.
[2:19:19.440 --> 2:19:27.440]  Exactly. We've got a breakaway civilization when we come back with Catherine Ross and Fisk but the highest level of banking and the whole global system.
[2:19:27.440 --> 2:19:41.440]  I'm going to break down, what is that breakaway civilization? What is its goals? Because more and more it talks about just getting rid of the lower level civilization and phasing us out with robotics and things, making us obsolete.
[2:19:41.440 --> 2:19:49.440]  I ask, where's all this going? The globalists have an exit strategy and the exit strategy, the end game, is getting rid of the majority of us.
[2:19:49.440 --> 2:19:55.440]  And a lot of the public acts like they don't care. So maybe the globalists have a right to do it. I've kind of gotten to that point.
[2:19:55.440 --> 2:20:13.440]  If they don't support it, if the public wants to be poisoned and destroyed and won't stand up for themselves, then they get what they deserve. I'll be right back. Stay with us.

[2:23:29.440 --> 2:23:43.440]  It's called the Deep State. Barack Obama's most loyal aides still hold office and they want to stop President Trump. Deep State was first revealed in the runaway New York Times bestseller Big Agenda.
[2:23:43.440 --> 2:24:05.440]  David Horowitz's Big Agenda exposes Obama's government in exile and his shocking plan. Newsmax, Lutobs, and Coulter all say you must read Big Agenda at bookstores everywhere. Or check out our free offer. Call 800 Newsmax, 800 Newsmax, or go to bigagenda411.com. That's bigagenda411.com.
[2:24:05.440 --> 2:24:13.440]  Catherine Austin fits us our guests. She's with us about 10 minutes in the next segment. I'm going to open the phones up on any issue you'd like to discuss.
[2:24:13.440 --> 2:24:28.440]  It was live Wednesday edition. Salari is her website, salari.com. Her magazine, The Salari Report, is excellent. She's not left or right. She's common sense, worked in the administrations, worked at the big federal bodies.
[2:24:28.440 --> 2:24:36.440]  She's seen it all for herself, managed $300 billion. And everything she's been warning about since she got out of the system decades ago is now coming true.
[2:24:36.440 --> 2:24:46.440]  Reminds me of one of the managing directors at Goldman Sachs. Naomi Prens has been warning people for like 15 years. She was making a lot of money with them, but she just couldn't be part of it because it's so crazy.
[2:24:46.440 --> 2:24:52.440]  Now we see this big Dutch banker coming out and talking about how immoral it is. And now it's like just a total coldness towards humanity.
[2:24:52.440 --> 2:25:01.440]  And she was just getting to two civilizations. And the elite see it as a breakaway civilization where they siphon off our energy, our money, our inventions.
[2:25:01.440 --> 2:25:09.440]  And then build their new system that's basically invisible to us financially, culturally, you name it, under global corporate national security.
[2:25:09.440 --> 2:25:21.440]  So Catherine, if you can, let's get a little bit into what this breakaway civilization is doing. And the fact that it admits in all its major white papers, it's planning on basically replacing us with machines.
[2:25:21.440 --> 2:25:35.440]  Well, what it's trying to do is organize a global currency that really impacts or really affects much greater central control through the digital systems.
[2:25:35.440 --> 2:25:46.440]  So you're really looking at a digital system creation that will work globally, primarily through the money, but the surveillance and intelligence systems are exceptionally important.
[2:25:46.440 --> 2:25:54.440]  And I think part of what you're watching going on in North Korea and the Middle East is to try and get everybody into what I call the central banking warfare model.
[2:25:54.440 --> 2:26:06.440]  So that's part of it. The other thing is it's absolutely true that new technology is rolling out that will be as impactful as going from an agricultural society to industrial society.
[2:26:06.440 --> 2:26:20.440]  So many of the jobs we have now will be automated. And the question is, you know, how do you, how do you, how do you migrate the opportunities for income to the middle class in the developed world?
[2:26:20.440 --> 2:26:29.440]  And even globally, if you're pushing, if you're industrializing agriculture and pushing two or three billion people out of the land into the cities, what are those people going to do?
[2:26:29.440 --> 2:26:40.440]  And so, you know, there are many opportunities for all of us to do many other things, but the entrepreneurial process that needs to happen is being afforded.
[2:26:40.440 --> 2:26:43.440]  That's one of the, one of the things that President Trump ran on.
[2:26:43.440 --> 2:26:48.440]  So, you know, I think you're asking the right question, what is the end game and the way I would say it.
[2:26:48.440 --> 2:26:56.440]  And we talk about it in the Salary Report is we are really at the cusp, Alex, of deciding are we going to be a human civilization or an inhuman civilization.
[2:26:56.440 --> 2:27:05.440]  And it is absolutely imperative for all of us that believe in a human civilization to just stand and turn to this and say, no, we're not, we're not playing.
[2:27:05.440 --> 2:27:08.440]  We're not going along.
[2:27:08.440 --> 2:27:12.440]  I know there's more debates inside the globalist power structure now about what's actually being built.
[2:27:12.440 --> 2:27:18.440]  And there does seem to be more resistance, even in the structure towards following through with this.
[2:27:18.440 --> 2:27:21.440]  But even the elites that aren't pure evil, they don't know how to get out of it.
[2:27:21.440 --> 2:27:26.440]  Like you said, presidents get captured by it, so even elites get captured by it.
[2:27:26.440 --> 2:27:28.440]  It seems like it's just an out of control monster.
[2:27:28.440 --> 2:27:33.440]  Like Nixon said, it's a wild beast, a machine.
[2:27:33.440 --> 2:27:41.440]  It is a wild beast and machine and it's got its own momentum because the things that have done, you know, I always say crime that pays is crime that stays.
[2:27:41.440 --> 2:27:53.440]  Crime has worked and it has been able, we have been able through keeping this fake news cycle and an absence of financial transparency to allow the people doing the crime to be the most admired.
[2:27:53.440 --> 2:27:56.440]  I've watched your frustration during the election with the Clintons.
[2:27:56.440 --> 2:28:10.440]  The Clintons are a perfect example of people who continue to be admired and held up as socially respectable when, if you know what they've really been up to, it's unfathomable that they would be considered socially respectable.
[2:28:10.440 --> 2:28:13.440]  And that's why it's so important you bust the fake news link.
[2:28:13.440 --> 2:28:25.440]  It absolutely can be changed and it absolutely can be stopped, but it means the rest of us are going to have to focus on what do we do to nurture and build a human civilization.
[2:28:25.440 --> 2:28:31.440]  And it starts with understanding that we have a group of people who've got the bit in their mouth and they want an inhuman civilization.
[2:28:31.440 --> 2:28:39.440]  It's very hard for many successful, particularly business people to understand that it really is that bad and that's part of what's got to be made clear.
[2:28:39.440 --> 2:28:43.440]  It really is that bad and now we have to create the alternatives.
[2:28:43.440 --> 2:28:47.440]  Believe it or not, the alternatives are far more wealth creating than what these folks are up to.
[2:28:47.440 --> 2:28:52.440]  It's just more wealth creating for them to own all the wealth.
[2:28:52.440 --> 2:28:56.440]  So they would rather have a smaller pie that they control than a much bigger pie.
[2:28:56.440 --> 2:29:04.440]  And it's contingent on the rest of us to say, wait a minute, there's a plan that includes all of us that has a much greater pie.
[2:29:04.440 --> 2:29:14.440]  Let me read a quote by one of the bankers that got into the really, really seedy, dark areas of the psychopath test that they give initiatives into this gang.
[2:29:14.440 --> 2:29:24.440]  The people who do not underestimate the severity of this are but few because this is an annihilating force that hates our guts.
[2:29:24.440 --> 2:29:25.440]  It hates our creation.
[2:29:25.440 --> 2:29:30.440]  It hates life and it will do anything to destroy us completely.
[2:29:30.440 --> 2:29:35.440]  And the way to do that is to divide humanity, divide and conquer is their truth he added.
[2:29:35.440 --> 2:29:36.440]  That's very, very profound.
[2:29:36.440 --> 2:29:40.440]  So there are very few people out there that actually estimate just how bad this is.
[2:29:40.440 --> 2:29:41.440]  I am one of them.
[2:29:41.440 --> 2:29:49.440]  Catherine's one of them because she's been on the inside and we'll talk about these two different worldviews, pro-death, pro-enslavement, pro-life.
[2:29:49.440 --> 2:29:52.440]  On the other side, infowars.com is our website.
[2:29:52.440 --> 2:29:53.440]  They're trying to censor it.
[2:29:53.440 --> 2:29:54.440]  Please spread the link.
[2:29:54.440 --> 2:29:55.440]  We're on the march.
[2:29:55.440 --> 2:29:56.440]  The Empire is on the march.
[2:29:56.440 --> 2:29:58.440]  Part of a 30 hour global transmission.
[2:29:58.440 --> 2:30:03.440]  This is the Forbidden Truth.
[2:30:28.440 --> 2:30:31.440]  What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly.
[2:30:31.440 --> 2:30:34.440]  It is dearness only that gives everything its value.
[2:30:34.440 --> 2:30:37.440]  Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods.
[2:30:37.440 --> 2:30:43.440]  And it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.
[2:30:43.440 --> 2:30:51.440]  Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right not only to tax, but to bind us in all cases whatsoever.
[2:30:51.440 --> 2:30:56.440]  And if being bound in that matter is not slavery, then there is no such thing as slavery upon Earth.
[2:30:56.440 --> 2:31:02.440]  Even the expression is impious, for so unlimited a power can only belong to God.
[2:31:02.440 --> 2:31:27.440]  Thomas Paine, The American Crisis.
[2:31:27.440 --> 2:31:32.440]  What is the difference? I don't feel good. The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[2:31:32.440 --> 2:31:35.440]  Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my super female.
[2:31:35.440 --> 2:31:40.440]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[2:31:40.440 --> 2:31:43.440]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[2:31:43.440 --> 2:31:47.440]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[2:31:47.440 --> 2:31:50.440]  So obviously the super female is amazing. I love it.
[2:31:50.440 --> 2:32:00.440]  Nascent iodine is essential. Survival Shield X2. If there's one product that I would say is life changing, that I would suggest it's nascent iodine Survival Shield X2.
[2:32:00.440 --> 2:32:21.440]  It's got a five star rating. It's a win-win.
[2:32:21.440 --> 2:32:24.440]  Research across the board is clear. In fact, it's certified.
[2:32:24.440 --> 2:32:30.440]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[2:32:30.440 --> 2:32:36.440]  That's why the last surgeon general's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[2:32:36.440 --> 2:32:39.440]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[2:32:39.440 --> 2:32:43.440]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine, instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[2:32:43.440 --> 2:32:50.440]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[2:32:50.440 --> 2:32:57.440]  Some of the ingredients in super blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.
[2:32:57.440 --> 2:33:10.440]  Learn more about InfoWarsLife Super Blue Toothpaste and InfoWarsLife.com and support the InfoWars while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[2:33:10.440 --> 2:33:24.440]  It's Wednesday, May 3, 2017. We are now initiating the launch of a 30-hour transmission in defense of the West in free speech, which are both under critical historic attack.
[2:33:24.440 --> 2:33:37.440]  If you simply go to InfoWars.com and spread the link, InfoWars.com forward slash show and spread our live YouTube and Facebook feeds as well as tell friends, family and neighbors about the local AM and FM stations they're listening on.
[2:33:37.440 --> 2:33:50.440]  We will gain millions of new listeners today during this special global transmission of mass human awakening and the overthrow of the new world order technotronic hell-bit globalist technocracy.
[2:33:50.440 --> 2:34:00.440]  That's a little cut I did this morning before the live broadcast that we're now 2 hours 33 minutes and 55 seconds into.
[2:34:00.440 --> 2:34:04.440]  The media makes a joke and says, I sound like a professional wrestler while my voice is shot.
[2:34:04.440 --> 2:34:17.440]  Professional wrestling is a facsimile of men upset fighting over something. That's the acting. This isn't an act. I have a shot larynx blown out voice like a 75 year old man, 75 year old drill sergeant.
[2:34:17.440 --> 2:34:29.440]  But these are epic things that are happening. Le Pen and the Brexit and Trump and even if those things don't go perfectly our way, it is a manifestation of people being upset about what's going on.
[2:34:29.440 --> 2:34:38.440]  I see it overall is very, very positive and people are waking up and the fact that the system scared a little old me shows really how pathetic they are.
[2:34:38.440 --> 2:34:45.440]  But once the people realize there's a private global corporate government that's above the law tax exempt, the diplomatic immunity.
[2:34:45.440 --> 2:34:52.440]  Once they learn there's this breakaway system in the elites own words, then we can start a real debate about it.
[2:34:52.440 --> 2:35:00.440]  The movie that came closest to this would be Elysium, but then that kind of had a socialist view of how to fix it and an open borders view.
[2:35:00.440 --> 2:35:12.440]  The globalists are imploding the third world using the giant third world populations and then bring down the first world because the first world is already a breakaway civilization that the super breakaway civilization wants to get rid of as well.
[2:35:12.440 --> 2:35:23.440]  They want to go back to city states, corporate city states, totally new cities built in rural areas, if you read UN and globalist writings, where only the elite live under high security.
[2:35:23.440 --> 2:35:31.440]  This is the new system we're going into. The future is here. It's just not equally distributed. That's been said by many people in different ways.
[2:35:31.440 --> 2:35:36.440]  We're running some of the biggest specials of the year at infowarstore.com. They're trying to shut us down.
[2:35:36.440 --> 2:35:42.440]  They're going to have sponsors, a member of the New York fellow reserve board suing me. They're coming after us.
[2:35:42.440 --> 2:35:56.440]  So 30% off brain force are great new tropic, 20% off secret 12, mythical bottom and vitamin B12, 20% off our sleep aid, knockout, 20% off winter sun, 20% off prostate guard, 20% off bio PCA, 20% off biome defense.
[2:35:56.440 --> 2:35:59.440]  We have a DNA forces back in stock, but not for long.
[2:35:59.440 --> 2:36:08.440]  I want to thank you all for your support. Defend free speech at mega special, get brain force plus again for 30% off at infowarslife.com.
[2:36:08.440 --> 2:36:15.440]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste with coil silver and iodine is back in stock. It's also 33% off right now.
[2:36:15.440 --> 2:36:22.440]  Let me read you a review of brain force by lineman 101 in 84 PA.
[2:36:22.440 --> 2:36:29.440]  They're telling you the truth. The supplement really is amazing, giving me positive high focus attitudes throughout the day.
[2:36:29.440 --> 2:36:34.440]  Excellent memory call and smooth consistent thought process to multitask different projects simultaneously.
[2:36:34.440 --> 2:36:40.440]  All of this without the crash you get. That's what we wanted to develop with caffeine and without the next day fog.
[2:36:40.440 --> 2:36:47.440]  Some other supplements I have and will continue to recommend brain force plus everyone I know now with 20% more in each bottle.
[2:36:47.440 --> 2:36:57.440]  So many other five star reviews infowarslife.com and when you fund us, it is a serious move towards the globalist towards their system being brought down.
[2:36:57.440 --> 2:37:06.440]  When you go to farmers markets, when you start a local truck farm, when you start a black Smith shop, when you spend time with your family,
[2:37:06.440 --> 2:37:12.440]  when you create your own literature or art or your own music that is outside the corporate system, it brings them down.
[2:37:12.440 --> 2:37:20.440]  It's about left or right folks. It's about building pro human systems and Catherine Austin Fitz of Solari.com is an expert on that.
[2:37:20.440 --> 2:37:26.440]  Her amazing magazine is the Solari report. You definitely want to get this. It's a beautiful magazine.
[2:37:26.440 --> 2:37:34.440]  You may think you know all of this, but you don't and it's great to give as a gift to others.
[2:37:34.440 --> 2:37:39.440]  And she's got a new report card for them in the first 70 days. I thought it was pretty good in the first 70.
[2:37:39.440 --> 2:37:43.440]  But boy, after that, he really started turning sideways, still doing some good.
[2:37:43.440 --> 2:37:47.440]  So in the 10 minutes we've got Catherine, I really appreciate your time.
[2:37:47.440 --> 2:37:54.440]  I've been asking the questions you've already brought up some really thought provoking deep information.
[2:37:54.440 --> 2:37:58.440]  How's humanity doing? Are we doing better than we were five years ago? Are we doing worse?
[2:37:58.440 --> 2:38:04.440]  What are other big signposts we should look for? What else do you want to impart to people?
[2:38:04.440 --> 2:38:12.440]  We're doing much better than we were doing five years ago because I think especially after the bailouts, more and more people understand something significant has to change.
[2:38:12.440 --> 2:38:20.440]  So transparency is first. So you have to be transparency the problem. After that, you have to go to work on it, but you have to break it down.
[2:38:20.440 --> 2:38:32.440]  So I spend every four years really in a state of complete frustration because we keep spending countless hours focused on changing the members of the pro-centralization team in Washington.
[2:38:32.440 --> 2:38:37.440]  That's not going to do it. You've got to drain the swamp one county at a time.
[2:38:37.440 --> 2:38:41.440]  And as I said, the president can do a lot if you have an 80% consensus.
[2:38:41.440 --> 2:38:48.440]  So my theory is you've got to turn the red button green, which is you've got to make money pushing the red button.
[2:38:48.440 --> 2:38:59.440]  Because in fact, if you get the local business people, the local banks, the local farmers in a room and start going through the federal budgets and financial statements for your county,
[2:38:59.440 --> 2:39:07.440]  just bring it down to a place-based basis. But if you go through all the federal money sources and uses in your county, the credit, the programs, everything else,
[2:39:07.440 --> 2:39:19.440]  the local businesses, Alex, can make money and create lots of employment and new entrepreneurial opportunities by getting all that stuff back in a way that's going to help the budget.
[2:39:19.440 --> 2:39:33.440]  So when I was at HUD, we used to see people building new HUD housing for $250,000 a unit when $50,000 would buy and rehab a single-family home in the HUD foreclose inventory in the same four-block area.
[2:39:33.440 --> 2:39:40.440]  And I went to the person who ran that program and I said, look, we could have four or five homes for the price of one.
[2:39:40.440 --> 2:39:43.440]  And they said, but how would we generate fees for our friends?
[2:39:43.440 --> 2:39:51.440]  Now, you know, we're all dependent directly or indirectly on fees for our friends, and that's why it's so important in every community.
[2:39:51.440 --> 2:40:02.440]  They call it participatory budgeting. If you can get the business and banking and financial leadership in every community to start looking for opportunities to re-engineer the federal budget,
[2:40:02.440 --> 2:40:04.440]  I assure you the thousands of them.
[2:40:04.440 --> 2:40:13.440]  Why is Washington paying a defense contractor $150 an hour for something that can be teleported into your community for $25 was felt?
[2:40:13.440 --> 2:40:19.440]  So draining the swamp means transferring the power back to the people and back to the states, but we have to actually be willing to do it.
[2:40:19.440 --> 2:40:22.440]  And we'd actually get more of our money back and be more prosperous.
[2:40:22.440 --> 2:40:27.440]  And, you know, he talked about that in his powerful January 20th State of the Union speech that I thought was pure Americana.
[2:40:27.440 --> 2:40:36.440]  But then the problem is to take all the Bernie Sanders supporters and all the Trump supporters in every county, the ones who want to play.
[2:40:36.440 --> 2:40:40.440]  And what you say is, okay, how do we make money draining the swamp?
[2:40:40.440 --> 2:40:52.440]  Because the way you make money draining the swap is you take the all those financial flows that are going to people who are not, you know, sort of on our team and getting them to flow back on our team.
[2:40:52.440 --> 2:40:57.440]  So where are the honest local banks, where are the honest businesses who can do a good job?
[2:40:57.440 --> 2:41:03.440]  How do you get the whole contracting flow and the purchase flow and the business flow flowing back to them?
[2:41:03.440 --> 2:41:05.440]  So switch the money.
[2:41:05.440 --> 2:41:06.440]  That's how you do it.
[2:41:06.440 --> 2:41:07.440]  And it's very granular.
[2:41:07.440 --> 2:41:09.440]  You've got to do it bottom up.
[2:41:09.440 --> 2:41:19.440]  If you had a group of Bernie Sanders supporters and Trump supporters working together to plow into the money in every county in America, I assure you Trump would end up.
[2:41:19.440 --> 2:41:20.440]  No, I agree.
[2:41:20.440 --> 2:41:27.440]  That's the problem. The Sanders supporters are right about a lot of corporate greed and corporations being above the law, but then they want socialism, don't our communism, a lot of them.
[2:41:27.440 --> 2:41:30.440]  Don't they get to look at Venezuela, look at Cuba, look at North Korea.
[2:41:30.440 --> 2:41:35.440]  How do we get them to understand that it is human empowerment and local control that works?
[2:41:35.440 --> 2:41:38.440]  I mean, as we know, communism only works locally as well.
[2:41:38.440 --> 2:41:40.440]  Nothing works except local.
[2:41:40.440 --> 2:41:42.440]  You take it local and here's how.
[2:41:42.440 --> 2:41:43.440]  And you talk money.
[2:41:43.440 --> 2:41:45.440]  You don't talk concept.
[2:41:45.440 --> 2:41:53.440]  So I used to be on a great list of with a community organizer from Ohio and he and I agree, disagreed on everything.
[2:41:53.440 --> 2:41:58.440]  Whenever we talked ideology, we disagreed on everything and the fights were bitter.
[2:41:58.440 --> 2:42:07.440]  Every time we talked about what we needed to do in a local neighborhood and we had a budget, we had the numbers, we agreed in 95% of the time.
[2:42:07.440 --> 2:42:12.440]  So you know, ideology gets in the way of cold hard facts.
[2:42:12.440 --> 2:42:22.440]  Ideology is a complete divide and conquer tactic to divide people who all agree that the money should be used lawfully.
[2:42:22.440 --> 2:42:36.440]  If you can just agree that the laws of the Constitution and the laws of financial management should be applied to the federal government, then you will get 95% agreement between the Bernie Sanders people and the Donald Trump people.
[2:42:36.440 --> 2:42:39.440]  And as long as you keep it local.
[2:42:39.440 --> 2:42:42.440]  And that's the positive view. Let's look at the globalist view.
[2:42:42.440 --> 2:42:48.440]  They admit they want a neo feudal system where the people are set in in a poor system.
[2:42:48.440 --> 2:42:50.440]  They use fake environmentalism to control us.
[2:42:50.440 --> 2:42:52.440]  Ignore all the real environmental crises.
[2:42:52.440 --> 2:42:55.440]  They have all these UN agenda 21s written by the big banks.
[2:42:55.440 --> 2:43:02.440]  And then we see big mega banks and the ultra rich promoting communism and Obama going to Latin America and saying communism is good.
[2:43:02.440 --> 2:43:13.440]  There he is in this whole capitalist system, this sick relationship between crony capitalism and any type of authoritarianism fascism oligarchy is communism.
[2:43:13.440 --> 2:43:18.440]  Do you agree with that a and then be why is that relationship so so so pervasive.
[2:43:18.440 --> 2:43:23.440]  Right now we have a cycle of disrespect between the leadership and the people.
[2:43:23.440 --> 2:43:35.440]  And one of the reasons the leadership literally engineered a financial coup d'etat is because they couldn't figure out a way to build a constituency for financial responsibility and get the money run clean.
[2:43:35.440 --> 2:43:38.440]  So the United States was built on the principle.
[2:43:38.440 --> 2:43:43.440]  By the way, I was told that by the head of one of the biggest banks in the US on a first class, you know, flight on American Airlines.
[2:43:43.440 --> 2:43:44.440]  It was all of records.
[2:43:44.440 --> 2:43:47.440]  I can't say the guy's name, but he basically said Alex, they're immoral.
[2:43:47.440 --> 2:43:48.440]  They don't want it.
[2:43:48.440 --> 2:43:50.440]  We've already tried it 50 years ago.
[2:43:50.440 --> 2:43:52.440]  We're taking over.
[2:43:52.440 --> 2:43:56.440]  You have you have a group of people who've had it proved to them again and again.
[2:43:56.440 --> 2:43:57.440]  It can't work.
[2:43:57.440 --> 2:44:04.440]  And and yes, you have you absolutely have a group that's immoral, but you have plenty of other people who you can't run the system.
[2:44:04.440 --> 2:44:05.440]  They can't.
[2:44:05.440 --> 2:44:08.440]  The top guys can't run the system without the establishment.
[2:44:08.440 --> 2:44:13.440]  You have plenty of people in that establishment who would like to see it work, but they don't know how.
[2:44:13.440 --> 2:44:16.440]  And so I spent a lifetime trying to work out the nuts and bolts.
[2:44:16.440 --> 2:44:18.440]  I know it can work.
[2:44:18.440 --> 2:44:20.440]  The question is where the people.
[2:44:20.440 --> 2:44:26.440]  But as Thomas Jefferson said, if you have an immoral population, you can't have a free country.
[2:44:26.440 --> 2:44:27.440]  I disagree.
[2:44:27.440 --> 2:44:32.440]  You bring enough transparency to their immorality and I assure you they will be shunned.
[2:44:32.440 --> 2:44:38.440]  So this is why transparency is at the very, very heart of what we need to we have to do.
[2:44:38.440 --> 2:44:40.440]  And notice we're more transparent than ever.
[2:44:40.440 --> 2:44:46.440]  But big corporations, government, the UN, they're they're they're absolutely opaque.
[2:44:46.440 --> 2:44:47.440]  Correct.
[2:44:47.440 --> 2:44:50.440]  But they're opaque because we let the money be opaque.
[2:44:50.440 --> 2:44:51.440]  And that's why I keep coming back.
[2:44:51.440 --> 2:44:52.440]  Follow the money.
[2:44:52.440 --> 2:44:54.440]  Don't worry about any of that.
[2:44:54.440 --> 2:44:58.440]  Worry about the money in your county of every county and every person.
[2:44:58.440 --> 2:45:00.440]  So let me give you an example.
[2:45:00.440 --> 2:45:04.440]  Why is anybody banking at a New York Fed member bank?
[2:45:04.440 --> 2:45:06.440]  Why is any person in America banking?
[2:45:06.440 --> 2:45:15.440]  So if we're going to continue to support in the marketplace and support with our tax dollars and support people who do this.
[2:45:15.440 --> 2:45:23.440]  I mean, this really comes down to who are we going to admire the lawful or the quote unquote winner.
[2:45:23.440 --> 2:45:24.440]  Powerful.
[2:45:24.440 --> 2:45:25.440]  Catherine Austin fits.
[2:45:25.440 --> 2:45:26.440]  I just really admire your work.
[2:45:26.440 --> 2:45:33.440]  I also get your magazine and I watch your videos and then I go, hey, it's been two years since she's on, you know, life just starts going faster and faster.
[2:45:33.440 --> 2:45:34.440]  Please stay in contact.
[2:45:34.440 --> 2:45:37.440]  Please come on whenever you've got breaking news or you want to talk about a subject.
[2:45:37.440 --> 2:45:41.440]  You've got Nico's info and then Nico, try to get her on every few months.
[2:45:41.440 --> 2:45:46.440]  But anytime you want on any of the shows here, any of the broadcast, please come share your knowledge.
[2:45:46.440 --> 2:45:47.440]  Thank you so much.
[2:45:47.440 --> 2:45:50.440]  Just keep breaking through the ice, Alex.
[2:45:50.440 --> 2:45:52.440]  One last question.
[2:45:52.440 --> 2:45:55.440]  And I want your true answer on this in your gut.
[2:45:55.440 --> 2:46:00.440]  Do you think Trump really is a good guy and wanted to fix things?
[2:46:00.440 --> 2:46:09.440]  I think the more Trump worked on the campaign, the more he got interested in real solutions bottom up and saw the possibility.
[2:46:09.440 --> 2:46:18.440]  I think now that he's in the swamp trying to get things done, he realizes how dependent he is on the machinery.
[2:46:18.440 --> 2:46:24.440]  He's very frustrated and I think he would like to, you know, he sees the opportunity to make it positive.
[2:46:24.440 --> 2:46:31.440]  He's trying to find a way, but he's getting very, very frustrated and their carrot is sticking into debt.
[2:46:31.440 --> 2:46:33.440]  Man, you are so on target.
[2:46:33.440 --> 2:46:36.440]  That is exactly from my sources and everything.
[2:46:36.440 --> 2:46:43.440]  He is really a romantic type person and he really does want Americana in the 1950s, 2.0.
[2:46:43.440 --> 2:46:44.440]  He does want wealth for everybody.
[2:46:44.440 --> 2:46:48.440]  He's one of the most unracist people out there from people I know behind the scenes that know him.
[2:46:48.440 --> 2:46:51.440]  And he really wants to get rid of the big giant underclasses.
[2:46:51.440 --> 2:46:54.440]  He's a guy that's based on the service economy.
[2:46:54.440 --> 2:46:59.440]  So he hates seeing people get poor and the word is he's getting pretty demoralized.
[2:46:59.440 --> 2:47:01.440]  The first 70 days he tried to charge in.
[2:47:01.440 --> 2:47:03.440]  They called him a Russian agent.
[2:47:03.440 --> 2:47:04.440]  They tried to shut him down.
[2:47:04.440 --> 2:47:06.440]  All the agencies rebelled against him.
[2:47:06.440 --> 2:47:07.440]  So he started compromising.
[2:47:07.440 --> 2:47:13.440]  He's still trying to get the economy turned back on, but you can just see the swamp is draining him.
[2:47:13.440 --> 2:47:15.440]  Well, here's the here.
[2:47:15.440 --> 2:47:19.440]  Let's look at this in terms of math.
[2:47:19.440 --> 2:47:24.440]  If you look at the total wealth that we have on planet Earth right now, it's 1% of what it could be.
[2:47:24.440 --> 2:47:31.440]  So Trump's a money guy and he understands the possibility to dramatically increase the total pie.
[2:47:31.440 --> 2:47:38.440]  What he's up against and starting to understand is the very top of the top don't want to optimize the total pie.
[2:47:38.440 --> 2:47:43.440]  They want to keep very tight control and continue to run things in secret.
[2:47:43.440 --> 2:47:49.440]  And that's what he's running into and why he didn't quite understand that completely when he went in.
[2:47:49.440 --> 2:47:50.440]  I'm not sure.
[2:47:50.440 --> 2:47:51.440]  That's right.
[2:47:51.440 --> 2:47:54.440]  That's why you've got his chief of staff and all of them saying, look, we're dealing with a deep state.
[2:47:54.440 --> 2:47:57.440]  They're ignoring us and the deep state's bragging about it.
[2:47:57.440 --> 2:48:00.440]  It's so erring and it's out there trying to organize a violent coup.
[2:48:00.440 --> 2:48:08.440]  I think Trump can't believe that there are that many people willing to go along with something that is inhuman.
[2:48:08.440 --> 2:48:11.440]  That's what he finds befuddling.
[2:48:11.440 --> 2:48:17.440]  Why are so many humans supporting something that will ultimately lead to their demise or their children's demise?
[2:48:17.440 --> 2:48:19.440]  That's what he's struggling to understand.
[2:48:19.440 --> 2:48:28.440]  And that's why you have to get into the whole issue, not only of fake news, but using entrainments of liberal programming and other kinds of mind control techniques.
[2:48:28.440 --> 2:48:33.440]  Sure. That's it. I mean, he made a real run at him in the campaign in the first 70.
[2:48:33.440 --> 2:48:38.440]  And then he started giving up and then Bannon got sidelined because they were going to overthrow him.
[2:48:38.440 --> 2:48:40.440]  And so I don't think he sold out.
[2:48:40.440 --> 2:48:46.440]  He just compromised and made a deal because he realizes how weak the people are, how weak Congress is.
[2:48:46.440 --> 2:48:47.440]  And you're right.
[2:48:47.440 --> 2:48:48.440]  We are all the swamp.
[2:48:48.440 --> 2:48:49.440]  It's an inside job.
[2:48:49.440 --> 2:48:50.440]  We've got to drain ourselves.
[2:48:50.440 --> 2:48:53.440]  Catherine Austin Fitz, thank you so much for joining us.
[2:48:53.440 --> 2:48:55.440]  Have a great day, Alex.
[2:48:55.440 --> 2:48:56.440]  That lady is so on target.
[2:48:56.440 --> 2:48:58.440]  I mean, she can just crystallize things down, down to it.
[2:48:58.440 --> 2:49:01.440]  She's got a lot of liberals that absolutely love her and conservatives.
[2:49:01.440 --> 2:49:02.440]  Really, really smart lady.
[2:49:02.440 --> 2:49:03.440]  The Solari report.
[2:49:03.440 --> 2:49:05.440]  Talk about it at Solari.com.
[2:49:05.440 --> 2:49:07.440]  And folks, you may know everything about this.
[2:49:07.440 --> 2:49:08.440]  I know a lot about it.
[2:49:08.440 --> 2:49:10.440]  You've got to support people like her.
[2:49:10.440 --> 2:49:12.440]  You've got to give this to other people.
[2:49:12.440 --> 2:49:14.440]  You've got to leave it at coffee shops.
[2:49:14.440 --> 2:49:18.440]  You've got to leave it at the barbershop, the salon, at church, whatever.
[2:49:18.440 --> 2:49:23.440]  We've got to get this out because a grain of truth can abolish a mountain of lies.
[2:49:23.440 --> 2:49:28.440]  But also, a lie goes halfway around the world before the truth puts its pants on, to quote
[2:49:28.440 --> 2:49:29.440]  Mark Twain.
[2:49:29.440 --> 2:49:31.440]  So this is quite a ton of you live.
[2:49:31.440 --> 2:49:32.440]  Mike Cernovich is coming up.
[2:49:32.440 --> 2:49:33.440]  I'm going to spend a few minutes with him.
[2:49:33.440 --> 2:49:35.440]  So I'm a fan of Mike Cernovich.
[2:49:35.440 --> 2:49:37.440]  And then, of course, I want to take calls.
[2:49:37.440 --> 2:49:40.440]  I'm the worst about it with all these, yes, not taking calls.
[2:49:40.440 --> 2:49:43.440]  The calls are amazing, especially when I take a lot of them, then the good callers call in.
[2:49:43.440 --> 2:49:47.440]  800-25-99-231-800-2599-231.
[2:49:47.440 --> 2:49:49.440]  I want you to call in.
[2:49:49.440 --> 2:49:51.440]  We're going to have different numbers in different studios.
[2:49:51.440 --> 2:49:53.440]  That's the network number.
[2:49:53.440 --> 2:49:55.440]  We've got the number out of the radio studio, the numbers.
[2:49:55.440 --> 2:49:56.440]  We've got four studios.
[2:49:56.440 --> 2:49:59.440]  So we're going to have different numbers throughout the day in different studios.
[2:49:59.440 --> 2:50:05.440]  But I want every host that hosts to take at least 15, 20 minutes of calls, bam, bam, bam, today.
[2:50:05.440 --> 2:50:08.440]  So that's right through tomorrow of the 30-hour broadcast.
