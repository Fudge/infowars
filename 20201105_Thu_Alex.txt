[00:00.000 --> 00:19.280]  What I'm about to tell you is not an exaggeration, it is exactly what's happening, and only
[00:19.280 --> 00:25.780]  by being a realist and facing it we have any chance of not going into hardcore bondage
[00:25.780 --> 00:31.040]  and the complete destruction of the republic as we know it, our children's futures, hanging
[00:31.040 --> 00:36.200]  the balance, all of humanity hangs the balance because once they've taken the U.S. over,
[00:36.200 --> 00:42.360]  imagine what the same satanic forces did when they captured Russia in 1917, 1918, imagine
[00:42.360 --> 00:46.840]  what they'll do with the U.S. fully under their satanic control.
[00:46.840 --> 00:52.360]  America is fighting for its very life, the Democratic Party is not a party, it is a criminal
[00:52.360 --> 00:59.160]  organization working for multinational crime syndicate and the Chinese Communist, and
[00:59.160 --> 01:04.040]  the headline at infowars.com for this live show is deadly accurate.
[01:04.040 --> 01:12.280]  Communist China is overthrowing the United States of America and replacing it with a
[01:12.280 --> 01:15.960]  puppet government, just like when the Nazis took over France, they already bought off
[01:15.960 --> 01:20.680]  the military leaders, they stood down and they set up a puppet VC French in the south
[01:20.680 --> 01:23.200]  of France.
[01:23.200 --> 01:27.160]  This is history, this is real, and the CFR and others brag they're doing this, three
[01:27.160 --> 01:28.920]  years ago at Davos they said G.G.
[01:28.920 --> 01:32.000]  Ping would crush America and defeat Trump.
[01:32.000 --> 01:38.080]  This is total criminal activity, we have all the proof, I'll cover it, of fraud, pillar
[01:38.080 --> 01:44.960]  to post, the entire chain of fraud in Michigan, in Wisconsin, in Pennsylvania, in Georgia,
[01:44.960 --> 01:49.520]  in Arizona, in Nevada, and so people ask, where is Trump?
[01:49.520 --> 01:53.880]  I was asking that question, well it's up to us now, he knows that, here's Tucker Carlson
[01:53.880 --> 02:00.320]  laying it out and then we'll be back and we will tell you the ugly truth.
[02:00.320 --> 02:04.520]  In a lot of ways, unfortunately, what happened last night could not have been worse for this
[02:04.520 --> 02:07.800]  country, for our children, for our grandchildren, for our future.
[02:07.800 --> 02:11.480]  The outcome of our presidential election was seized from the hands of voters, where of
[02:11.480 --> 02:16.640]  course it rightly belongs, and now resides in the control of lawyers and courts and highly
[02:16.640 --> 02:19.840]  partisan, clearly corrupt big city bureaucrats.
[02:19.840 --> 02:23.080]  So no matter what happens next, that is a tragedy.
[02:23.080 --> 02:27.480]  Many Americans will never again accept the results of a presidential election.
[02:27.480 --> 02:31.280]  That story is still unfolding tonight, obviously, and we're going to follow it as honestly as
[02:31.280 --> 02:34.440]  we can wherever it leads, we'll begin with that in just a minute.
[02:34.440 --> 02:38.320]  But first, we want to acknowledge the good news, and believe it or not there is some
[02:38.320 --> 02:43.720]  good news, regardless of everything else that has happened, and here it is, America remains,
[02:43.720 --> 02:46.760]  it's still here, that's the first and most important thing.
[02:46.760 --> 02:50.080]  And it's not a foregone conclusion, we almost lost it.
[02:50.080 --> 02:53.800]  Democrats told us they wanted to beat Donald Trump, they spent more money than anyone ever
[02:53.800 --> 02:57.980]  has in any election in history to do that.
[02:57.980 --> 03:00.400]  But there was a lot more going on.
[03:00.400 --> 03:04.280]  Democrats didn't harness the full power of big tech and the billionaire class simply
[03:04.280 --> 03:07.160]  to make Joe Biden president, no.
[03:07.160 --> 03:10.880]  What they really wanted was total control over everything.
[03:10.880 --> 03:15.920]  No more democracy, no more dissent, permanent obedience from the rest of us.
[03:15.920 --> 03:18.800]  And they came shockingly close to getting that.
[03:18.800 --> 03:22.480]  If Democrats had won the White House and the Senate last night, the country as we know
[03:22.480 --> 03:27.000]  it would have ended, not because Democrats have bad ideas, though they do, but because
[03:27.000 --> 03:33.880]  Democrats plan to impose an entirely new system on our country, not an agenda, a system.
[03:33.880 --> 03:38.280]  With nothing to check their power, the left fully intended to eliminate the traditional
[03:38.280 --> 03:42.360]  American balances within our government, along with the Constitution and the Bill of
[03:42.360 --> 03:44.200]  Rights that constrain their power.
[03:44.200 --> 03:46.360]  We're not overstating this.
[03:46.360 --> 03:51.760]  Joe Biden's party planned to turn our highest court into a partisan political weapon.
[03:51.760 --> 03:52.840]  They admitted that.
[03:52.840 --> 03:56.520]  They wrote magazine articles about how they planned to do it.
[03:56.520 --> 04:00.120]  Then they planned to pack the Congress of the United States, a legislative branch, by
[04:00.120 --> 04:04.960]  adding new states to our union purely for the Senate seats.
[04:04.960 --> 04:06.240]  We're not speculating there either.
[04:06.240 --> 04:08.360]  They admitted that too.
[04:08.360 --> 04:14.000]  Then they planned to pack the electorate itself, the ultimate corruption in a democracy.
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.160]  Twenty million foreign nationals added to our voter rolls overnight.
[04:19.160 --> 04:20.600]  That was their agenda.
[04:20.600 --> 04:23.800]  How would any of that improve the United States of America?
[04:23.800 --> 04:26.640]  Well, they never claimed that it would.
[04:26.640 --> 04:29.400]  Making this country better was never the point.
[04:29.400 --> 04:35.320]  The point was to create a permanent Democratic majority, a one-party state, with complete
[04:35.320 --> 04:38.120]  control over the population.
[04:38.120 --> 04:43.080]  Never in our history has any mainstream political party proposed an agenda more radical than
[04:43.080 --> 04:44.080]  this.
[04:44.080 --> 04:45.240]  They didn't talk about it much.
[04:45.240 --> 04:47.080]  There's a reason for that, of course.
[04:47.080 --> 04:48.600]  They didn't want to scare you.
[04:48.600 --> 04:51.000]  But it was entirely real.
[04:51.000 --> 04:54.120]  And last night, it came very close to happening.
[04:54.120 --> 04:59.200]  We should all be deeply grateful that it didn't.
[04:59.200 --> 05:03.560]  I get asked all the time by the listeners, by the media, what am I most proud of when
[05:03.560 --> 05:07.960]  it comes to the show, and it's the fact that info wars more than 25 years ago, doing basic
[05:07.960 --> 05:12.920]  research with what the club of Rome and the CFR and others were actually saying, developed
[05:12.920 --> 05:17.520]  the hypothesis that the Communist China had been set up to take our jobs and transfer
[05:17.520 --> 05:21.720]  them to China and then make us economically destitute and position us into debt.
[05:21.720 --> 05:26.800]  Well, now China owns the debt, now China owns Hollywood, all the one-sided trading deals.
[05:26.800 --> 05:29.320]  It turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on.
[05:29.320 --> 05:35.400]  Again, it wasn't that hard, the CFR and others admitted what they were doing, but still others
[05:35.400 --> 05:37.080]  didn't want to focus on that issue.
[05:37.080 --> 05:38.080]  We did.
[05:38.080 --> 05:41.160]  And you focused on it by supporting us at info wars.
[05:41.160 --> 05:45.520]  So when you go to infowarstore.com and get all the great supplements, books, t-shirts,
[05:45.520 --> 05:49.640]  films, water filtration, air filtration, all of it, you're funding the organization that
[05:49.640 --> 05:52.280]  literally helped make up the world what's really happening.
[05:52.280 --> 05:54.240]  So that's a big accomplishment for all of you.
[05:54.240 --> 06:01.240]  I want to thank you for your support.
[06:36.160 --> 06:42.640]  The type of blue skies we want, these are the blue waves of the blue blood globalist
[06:42.640 --> 06:48.440]  destroying our once vibrant free republic because you can't have an open free society
[06:48.440 --> 06:52.600]  with uppity individuals that have a right to property and a right to their second amendment
[06:52.600 --> 06:56.800]  and a right to not kill their children and a right to not have their sons attacked by
[06:56.800 --> 06:59.800]  the system and domesticated and emasculated.
[06:59.800 --> 07:02.040]  No, you can't have that.
[07:02.040 --> 07:08.600]  And so we have systematic, massive total fraud, nakedly out on the open.
[07:08.600 --> 07:10.520]  We're going to walk through all of it here today.
[07:10.520 --> 07:16.920]  I am Alan Jones, your host, but let me just state this right up front for everybody.
[07:16.920 --> 07:19.160]  People finally get it.
[07:19.160 --> 07:22.160]  We're having our free speech online disenfranchised.
[07:22.160 --> 07:24.920]  Now they're stealing our vote and disenfranchising it.
[07:24.920 --> 07:29.120]  They're devaluing our currency and disenfranchising our financial future.
[07:29.120 --> 07:33.080]  They are poisoning the weaker minds in the country with division and racism in the name
[07:33.080 --> 07:34.400]  of fighting it.
[07:34.400 --> 07:38.920]  They're attacking the very foundations of our republic and are at war with the social
[07:38.920 --> 07:47.440]  contract in incredibly arrogant, hateful coalition of big tech vacuuming up the economy
[07:47.440 --> 07:50.320]  at a level never before seen.
[07:50.320 --> 07:56.680]  And then the commanders of big tech and the big banks that financed them openly say they're
[07:56.680 --> 08:01.240]  building a post-human world and openly say they're going to make us so poor that they
[08:01.240 --> 08:05.920]  will be able to dictate that we be sterilized and take force inoculations.
[08:05.920 --> 08:10.960]  You notice I just warned of this and warned of this for decades and now it's here because
[08:10.960 --> 08:13.200]  I was reading their plans.
[08:13.200 --> 08:18.960]  Now let me give you the big announcement here.
[08:18.960 --> 08:25.600]  If Joe Biden gets in, they're never getting rid of the lockdown.
[08:25.600 --> 08:27.760]  Think about that.
[08:27.760 --> 08:31.400]  It's a lot bigger than just kicking Trump out and flooding everything with fake ballots
[08:31.400 --> 08:34.200]  using the lockdown as the cover for it.
[08:34.200 --> 08:38.800]  They want to bankrupt us and then have us have an app to be able to leave our front
[08:38.800 --> 08:41.360]  door and step one foot outside of our house.
[08:41.360 --> 08:44.400]  That is the admitted globalist CHICOM plan.
[08:44.400 --> 08:46.400]  We're being given tracker systems.
[08:46.400 --> 08:47.800]  We're being taught to stay in our houses.
[08:47.800 --> 08:49.320]  We're being taught we're not essential.
[08:49.320 --> 08:52.880]  We're being marinated in martial law.
[08:52.880 --> 08:57.080]  That's what we've been in with big tech and the universities and the blue cities and the
[08:57.080 --> 09:03.960]  blue states and the UN and the CHICOMs, monkey see monkey do with this lockdown.
[09:03.960 --> 09:07.320]  And they're just going to start there and they're going to hype up more that the police
[09:07.320 --> 09:11.120]  are racist to take the police over and turn them into political officers like they've
[09:11.120 --> 09:14.520]  done in the UK and Europe.
[09:14.520 --> 09:20.600]  Now, foreign powers are openly involved, not just China, but India has been hired and others
[09:20.600 --> 09:25.000]  to flood the internet with disinfo and to put Biden in.
[09:25.000 --> 09:28.360]  They've disenfranchised our votes.
[09:28.360 --> 09:29.960]  They're turning us against each other.
[09:29.960 --> 09:30.960]  It's illegitimate.
[09:30.960 --> 09:37.600]  It's backed by foreign powers and even if he legitimately won the votes, which obviously
[09:37.600 --> 09:41.400]  you see the evidence of fraud everywhere, if that's not true, if it's far and backed,
[09:41.400 --> 09:42.720]  it's illegitimate.
[09:42.720 --> 09:48.480]  So exactly what they said Trump got in with is not true.
[09:48.480 --> 09:52.400]  It's how they are intending to get in.
[09:52.400 --> 09:58.280]  And there are armies, as I told you, of communist Chinese agents in the United States and there's
[09:58.280 --> 10:04.240]  videos of what appear to be Chinese individuals in Michigan arriving with those ballots at
[10:04.240 --> 10:10.760]  4 a.m. illegally and going into the buildings with ballot boxes that then were all for Biden.
[10:10.760 --> 10:19.360]  The arrogance level is so atrocious, is so mega-massive that they're not even trying
[10:19.360 --> 10:20.360]  to hide it.
[10:20.360 --> 10:27.600]  So let me just quantify this for you right now, then we'll come back and show you all
[10:27.600 --> 10:30.480]  the videos and go over all the evidence.
[10:30.480 --> 10:34.960]  America is under multinational consortium attack.
[10:34.960 --> 10:39.560]  Our government and our system is in the process of being overthrown.
[10:39.560 --> 10:43.160]  It's not just a political party that wants an agenda.
[10:43.160 --> 10:46.840]  They want a whole new system and they've set it.
[10:46.840 --> 10:54.240]  They are involved in a revolution fully conquering the United States and killing our republic
[10:54.240 --> 11:00.560]  and they're hammering the last nails in to the damn coffin to bury us alive as slaves
[11:00.560 --> 11:01.880]  of their system.
[11:01.880 --> 11:04.440]  So I'm not a macho guy.
[11:04.440 --> 11:07.680]  I don't say things just to say them, but I'll tell you this.
[11:07.680 --> 11:15.680]  I'm not going to launch any offensive violence at this point because I've not had time to
[11:15.680 --> 11:19.760]  really think about the right course in history.
[11:19.760 --> 11:21.560]  But I know this.
[11:21.560 --> 11:25.640]  If we let them steal the selection and we let them put a Chinese communist agent who's
[11:25.640 --> 11:31.080]  fully compromised with all the proof in there to have control of the nuclear codes, all
[11:31.080 --> 11:35.880]  of us are aiding and abetting the destruction of our country and the handover of the most
[11:35.880 --> 11:39.160]  authoritarian nation the world's ever seen, communist China.
[11:39.160 --> 11:44.560]  And I will not be an accomplice and I will not aid and abet this type of takeover.
[11:44.560 --> 11:49.080]  If it was just a bunch of thug Democrats taken over so they could steal money and stuff,
[11:49.080 --> 11:53.200]  but they weren't trying to literally end civilizations, we know it, and literally targeting our children,
[11:53.200 --> 11:59.080]  I would not risk my life and I would not be thinking about such draconian things.
[11:59.080 --> 12:00.880]  But they're building an army of violent people.
[12:00.880 --> 12:01.880]  They've been attacking us.
[12:01.880 --> 12:03.320]  They've been bullying us.
[12:03.320 --> 12:07.160]  They have been censoring us and they say they're coming after us and they're licking their
[12:07.160 --> 12:14.880]  lips and they are salivating, salivating over all of this.
[12:14.880 --> 12:19.960]  So all I'm telling everybody is we're in a new ball game and we knew this was coming.
[12:19.960 --> 12:22.640]  The globe was proposed this.
[12:22.640 --> 12:25.280]  They've overthrown many, many other countries.
[12:25.280 --> 12:29.560]  They've used similar formulas and they have demoralized us.
[12:29.560 --> 12:36.480]  They have absolutely gutted this republic and it's so sad that more people aren't resisting
[12:36.480 --> 12:37.480]  and saying no.
[12:37.480 --> 12:40.920]  There's a lot of people that are angry, a lot of people that are upset, a lot of people
[12:40.920 --> 12:46.080]  that are concerned, and there's a big wake-up happening right now.
[12:46.080 --> 12:47.480]  But it's not enough.
[12:47.480 --> 12:51.080]  People need to take this deadly, deadly serious.
[12:51.080 --> 12:53.560]  We're also entering the wheelhouse of false flags.
[12:53.560 --> 12:57.480]  Well they will target offensively an innocent group, they'll make it a racial attack to
[12:57.480 --> 13:00.680]  demonize all opposition to this communist globalist takeover.
[13:00.680 --> 13:06.400]  This is a corporate system, a fascist offshore tax exempt, but they're using a communist playbook
[13:06.400 --> 13:12.960]  to take over the population as the management system because it's worked everywhere else.
[13:12.960 --> 13:13.960]  There's the headline.
[13:13.960 --> 13:14.960]  Please put it back up.
[13:14.960 --> 13:16.360]  America is at war.
[13:16.360 --> 13:22.880]  Communist China is in the process of overthrowing the United States and installing a puppet
[13:22.880 --> 13:24.720]  government.
[13:24.720 --> 13:28.320]  That is literally happening.
[13:28.320 --> 13:31.120]  There is a coalition of corporations and authoritarian states.
[13:31.120 --> 13:38.120]  But China is the engine room, the laboratory, the testing ground, the power projection
[13:38.120 --> 13:44.920]  point of the whole future in all their white papers, the CFR, Trilateral Commission, Davos.
[13:44.920 --> 13:51.080]  They openly brag and crow that GG Ping is going to smash us.
[13:51.080 --> 13:57.040]  When you see the left, I mean one of our oldest crew members, been here 16 years, his sister
[13:57.040 --> 14:03.920]  is now basically a communist and says he loves GG Ping and wants him to crush Trump.
[14:03.920 --> 14:09.600]  No sense, total Stockholm syndrome, total mental illness, this is what they've done
[14:09.600 --> 14:15.840]  to our people, how they've pimped their brains out and turned them against their own families.
[14:15.840 --> 14:17.800]  We are in grievous danger.
[14:17.800 --> 14:21.640]  We are in grave danger, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:21.640 --> 14:27.720]  And so there's Trump up front, hey they stole this, we're not going to let them do it.
[14:27.720 --> 14:30.280]  And then the evidence is just founting out.
[14:30.280 --> 14:34.480]  But you turn on Fox News, Trump's not shown any proof there's election fraud.
[14:34.480 --> 14:39.240]  He and Giuliani have to show it and then they won't let state reps, they won't let citizens
[14:39.240 --> 14:42.960]  in, they won't let under law in Michigan or in Arizona.
[14:42.960 --> 14:46.840]  They're telling US representatives they can't go in and see the vote.
[14:46.840 --> 14:52.320]  And police with guns are telling them you can't come in here, that's Maricopa County,
[14:52.320 --> 14:58.520]  that's the same Democrats that tried to put Sheriff Arpaio in prison for no reason.
[14:58.520 --> 15:03.040]  No jury trial, for quote, being contempt of that judge.
[15:03.040 --> 15:05.480]  They're making their move.
[15:05.480 --> 15:11.200]  They think we're going to go along with it because they've never had push back.
[15:11.200 --> 15:16.160]  These are arrogant lawyers, these are criminals that have brokered the sellout of America
[15:16.160 --> 15:19.360]  and they want to position in the global government.
[15:19.360 --> 15:25.400]  And they want to atomize the family and domesticate us so we can never rise again and never resist
[15:25.400 --> 15:29.560]  the nightmare future they've got for all of us.
[15:29.560 --> 15:31.880]  The chains are going on right now.
[15:31.880 --> 15:33.920]  You're being disenfranchised, all of us are.
[15:33.920 --> 15:39.240]  So we better work peacefully now so that war does not become inevitable.
[15:39.240 --> 15:43.440]  But we are now entering the season of war.
[15:43.440 --> 15:45.760]  Our country is at war for its very life.
[15:45.760 --> 15:49.360]  You are under attack, you are being conquered, you are being taken over.
[15:49.360 --> 15:54.480]  We are in the midst of a chai combat, attempted takeover of the country and we're losing
[15:54.480 --> 15:57.400]  right now.
[15:57.400 --> 16:02.600]  Much of the time on big issues and societal developments, Info Wars is many, many years
[16:02.600 --> 16:03.600]  ahead.
[16:03.600 --> 16:08.640]  And almost all the time we are tomorrow's news today, but there's a blind spot that
[16:08.640 --> 16:09.640]  Info Wars has.
[16:09.640 --> 16:12.400]  I've noticed that really informed people have this as well.
[16:12.400 --> 16:15.880]  I know a lot of you tuning in are some of the most formidable out there, so I want you
[16:15.880 --> 16:20.240]  to be retrospective and kind of examine yourself because that's what I do every day.
[16:20.240 --> 16:26.520]  This hunter by laptop is important, but the new audio confirmed to be him, where he admits
[16:26.520 --> 16:31.160]  he works under the communist Chinese spy sheaf, he should be arrested right now.
[16:31.160 --> 16:33.600]  That is so huge.
[16:33.600 --> 16:38.120]  That is hiding in plain view and it's getting almost no attention.
[16:38.120 --> 16:40.160]  We have to get that information out to everybody.
[16:40.160 --> 16:45.760]  It's all posted on InfoWars.com, so many other major patriotic sites.
[16:45.760 --> 16:49.600]  But we need to get it out to everybody and remember that we know all of this.
[16:49.600 --> 16:50.600]  We knew it a long time ago.
[16:50.600 --> 16:53.840]  So when it breaks now, we kind of go, okay, tell us something we didn't know.
[16:53.840 --> 16:57.200]  The point is now it's documented, now it's proven.
[16:57.200 --> 17:02.320]  Election 2020 is here and whether Trump wins or loses, we have all won by exposing the
[17:02.320 --> 17:08.280]  communist Chinese, by exposing the globalist, by exposing the pedophile rings, by exposing
[17:08.280 --> 17:11.400]  the fact this is really a fight between good versus evil.
[17:11.400 --> 17:15.440]  Now I'm personally a Christian and I believe in God and I know God's real and I've experienced
[17:15.440 --> 17:16.440]  it in my life.
[17:16.440 --> 17:20.160]  But even if you don't believe in God, it's important to recognize that there is good
[17:20.160 --> 17:21.640]  in this world, there is evil.
[17:21.640 --> 17:26.160]  And there are people out there that want to do you harm because they enjoy doing that.
[17:26.160 --> 17:31.560]  And what I see happening across the spectrum of different political views is people finally
[17:31.560 --> 17:36.160]  get that, they finally understand that they're not being naive anymore.
[17:36.160 --> 17:41.960]  Don't ever project your decency and your goodness onto other people until they've proven what
[17:41.960 --> 17:45.240]  they stand for and who they are, or you're going to get hurt.
[17:45.240 --> 17:48.360]  But those of you out there that have done your own research and discovered who's good
[17:48.360 --> 17:52.480]  and who is faithful will then come together with those organizations and support them
[17:52.480 --> 17:53.480]  like InfoWars.
[17:53.480 --> 18:20.480]  And without your support, InfoWars would not exist.
[18:20.480 --> 18:41.200]  Welcome back, I'm your host Alex Jones and as I've been pointing out, the laws of nature,
[18:41.200 --> 18:48.440]  the laws of history are that if corrupt forces don't ever get in trouble for what they're
[18:48.440 --> 18:56.680]  doing, they will get more criminal, more abusive, more bold, their capers, their heist, their
[18:56.680 --> 19:02.760]  conspiracies will get larger until they take over your civilization and loot the living
[19:02.760 --> 19:10.880]  snot out of it and then move to Switzerland and you collapse like Venezuela or so many
[19:10.880 --> 19:11.880]  other countries.
[19:11.880 --> 19:13.680]  And that's where we are, the exact same playbook.
[19:13.680 --> 19:16.520]  And you ask, why would they be running a communist playbook?
[19:16.520 --> 19:22.120]  Because the thing works, folks, human nature is human nature, people are people.
[19:22.120 --> 19:26.040]  They can be brown people in Central America or South America, they can be white people
[19:26.040 --> 19:29.760]  in Europe, they can be black people in Africa, they can be yellow people in Asia.
[19:29.760 --> 19:36.040]  We all pretty much act the same at the end of the day.
[19:36.040 --> 19:41.840]  And folks only learn through experience, it seems, they can't learn through history,
[19:41.840 --> 19:51.040]  by education, three forms of learning, by revelation, by experience, or by education.
[19:51.040 --> 19:56.200]  And boy, are people about to get experience.
[19:56.200 --> 20:00.040]  The problem is going into the normalization of a communist takeover, it'll take them a
[20:00.040 --> 20:04.080]  good five years to loot everything and totally collapse it and the average person has such
[20:04.080 --> 20:08.960]  a low attention span, they'll think because Americans aren't turning over all their property
[20:08.960 --> 20:13.640]  and their children and aren't submitting, that's why the utopia didn't appear.
[20:13.640 --> 20:20.480]  It's always more, more, more, more, give us more, more regulations, more control.
[20:20.480 --> 20:25.360]  You've got all the sycophants of the ruling party that again, censors its opposition and
[20:25.360 --> 20:29.240]  begins to ban the party leaders of any other opposition.
[20:29.240 --> 20:33.640]  All of this is being said by the Democrats, reconciliation commissions, right out of South
[20:33.640 --> 20:41.600]  Africa, communist tactics, we're now in public schools, colleges, if you're white, you get
[20:41.600 --> 20:44.960]  up in front of the class and you tell them how you're bad and you apologize.
[20:44.960 --> 20:55.840]  This is Maoist programming spread across the world here now.
[20:55.840 --> 21:08.480]  You know, used to, we fought communism, but now we get on our knees and we worship it.
[21:08.480 --> 21:15.000]  And they're going to take everybody's bank accounts and everybody's jobs until you submit
[21:15.000 --> 21:20.120]  and then when you go on your little reconciliation commission and you apologize for your existence,
[21:20.120 --> 21:24.760]  they'll reward some of those people up front because America is now a giant open air re-education
[21:24.760 --> 21:25.760]  camp.
[21:25.760 --> 21:31.320]  And then it'll be more and more, they demand, you say, until you're in front of people saying
[21:31.320 --> 21:35.560]  you're the villain, just like Twitter makes you go and they say, we're going to ban you
[21:35.560 --> 21:38.360]  if you don't go to leak this tweet.
[21:38.360 --> 21:42.760]  They make you go up to the chalkboard and right in front of the class that you're bad.
[21:42.760 --> 21:50.160]  All of this is cult programming, Kool-Aid drinking drills, Jim Jones stuff.
[21:50.160 --> 21:54.840]  This is bonafide, if this was an alcohol, it's 200 proof ever clear.
[21:54.840 --> 21:55.840]  It's pure.
[21:55.840 --> 21:57.640]  It's moonshine.
[21:57.640 --> 21:59.960]  It's 100% tyrant.
[21:59.960 --> 22:08.440]  It's the nastiest, stinkiest, most horrid thing I've ever seen crawl out from under a rock.
[22:08.440 --> 22:12.840]  So and again, the globalists, I was told to the grapevine 10 years ago, like, we're not
[22:12.840 --> 22:13.840]  worried about Jones.
[22:13.840 --> 22:15.280]  He scares people for us.
[22:15.280 --> 22:17.840]  Well, I bet on the public and thought they're not going to get scared.
[22:17.840 --> 22:20.080]  They're going to get pissed if I tell them what's happening.
[22:20.080 --> 22:21.200]  I'm not trying to scare you.
[22:21.200 --> 22:22.200]  I believe in you.
[22:22.200 --> 22:24.520]  But I'm here to tell you, look at the headline on infowords.com.
[22:24.520 --> 22:25.520]  One more time for yourselves.
[22:25.520 --> 22:26.520]  Look at it one more time.
[22:26.520 --> 22:29.960]  Look at it long and hard.
[22:29.960 --> 22:33.680]  America is at war.
[22:33.680 --> 22:38.080]  Think about those words, America is at war.
[22:38.080 --> 22:39.760]  Who are we at war with?
[22:39.760 --> 22:47.960]  Communist China and its allies are in the process of overthrowing the United States.
[22:47.960 --> 22:54.920]  We the people, our vote, our speech, our communication, and installing a puppet government.
[22:54.920 --> 23:01.840]  Do you understand the parallel to this is the Blitzkrieg and the invasion of France
[23:01.840 --> 23:08.800]  and the French just gave up because the generals were paid off.
[23:08.800 --> 23:12.560]  And then Hitler thought he had this big victory until he actually went and fought people
[23:12.560 --> 23:15.880]  that didn't give up a little bit different.
[23:15.880 --> 23:17.280]  Well, I promise you this.
[23:17.280 --> 23:24.800]  I'm not giving up ever because I know the more I bend over, the worse stuff gets.
[23:24.800 --> 23:27.840]  And I will not sit here and be part of this.
[23:27.840 --> 23:31.200]  Now that doesn't mean they blow something up and say I did it.
[23:31.200 --> 23:32.880]  I'd never do that.
[23:32.880 --> 23:37.560]  I'm saying that they are violently taking our rights.
[23:37.560 --> 23:39.720]  They are violently taking over our society.
[23:39.720 --> 23:43.480]  They've got brown shirt thugs on the street stabbing and shooting and murdering people.
[23:43.480 --> 23:45.200]  They're overthrowing our local governments.
[23:45.200 --> 23:51.680]  They are involved in a classic authoritarian textbook takeover.
[23:51.680 --> 23:57.680]  And I'm going to say this very, very slowly.
[23:57.680 --> 24:01.440]  I know a lot of people that have been stabbed and shot at and had their ribs broken.
[24:01.440 --> 24:07.120]  I mean, Enrique Tarrio got stabbed with a bunch of people in D.C.
[24:07.120 --> 24:12.680]  Rand Paul got his ribs broken, his lungs punctured, beat up, the media praised it.
[24:12.680 --> 24:14.640]  They're shooting members of Congress.
[24:14.640 --> 24:17.760]  They've already been attacking us and attacking us, but they know we're conservatives.
[24:17.760 --> 24:18.760]  We're nationalists.
[24:18.760 --> 24:19.760]  We're patriots.
[24:19.760 --> 24:21.120]  They know we don't, we don't complain or whine.
[24:21.120 --> 24:23.000]  They're like, I just suck it up.
[24:23.000 --> 24:31.240]  Yeah, we're coming to castrate your little boys too, but just suck it up.
[24:31.240 --> 24:36.800]  This is a bold, savage criminal takeover.
[24:36.800 --> 24:40.320]  And President Trump came out and told the truth about what they're doing.
[24:40.320 --> 24:47.880]  You know, my brother-in-law, my sister's husband called me up voice-shaking the other
[24:47.880 --> 24:48.880]  day.
[24:48.880 --> 24:49.880]  He's not a guy that usually is angry.
[24:49.880 --> 24:53.840]  And he said, I was just at the post office, saw a guy with like 50 ballots, put his name
[24:53.840 --> 24:56.000]  on them and mailing them.
[24:56.000 --> 24:57.640]  And this is like the day after the election.
[24:57.640 --> 25:02.760]  Well, that's because we now know from the Project Veritas whistleblowers that they're
[25:02.760 --> 25:05.560]  post-dating stuff back before the election.
[25:05.560 --> 25:06.560]  And then they're delivering them.
[25:06.560 --> 25:14.680]  And we have the videos all over from Michigan to Wisconsin to Pennsylvania and other states
[25:14.680 --> 25:21.360]  of it, 4 a.m., at 5 a.m., trucks pull up, cars pull up.
[25:21.360 --> 25:22.800]  They're not government quote officials.
[25:22.800 --> 25:23.800]  The polls are closed.
[25:23.800 --> 25:25.680]  It's illegal what they're doing.
[25:25.680 --> 25:28.520]  They just so happen to be Chinese.
[25:28.520 --> 25:31.520]  It's in several of the videos, but of course they've got masks on.
[25:31.520 --> 25:33.000]  It's all perfect cover.
[25:33.000 --> 25:37.400]  And they load up what are the same ballot boxes that are put in behind the machines
[25:37.400 --> 25:38.400]  that you feed them into.
[25:38.400 --> 25:39.400]  It's the official.
[25:39.400 --> 25:40.400]  They've checked.
[25:40.400 --> 25:41.880]  It's the Michigan systems.
[25:41.880 --> 25:43.800]  And they take them into the voting center in Detroit.
[25:43.800 --> 25:48.320]  And then they've got witnesses inside that are lawyers that are thrown out and members
[25:48.320 --> 25:50.560]  of Congress show up and say, I want to see what's happening.
[25:50.560 --> 25:52.040]  Oh, no, you can't.
[25:52.040 --> 25:54.640]  But a random dude with a mask on, he can.
[25:54.640 --> 26:00.120]  He can come on in.
[26:00.120 --> 26:01.120]  And why not?
[26:01.120 --> 26:06.560]  They run government pedophile rings with the Democrats and then they don't get in trouble.
[26:06.560 --> 26:08.640]  I mean, they've gotten away with so much.
[26:08.640 --> 26:13.440]  Why wouldn't they just do this to us?
[26:13.440 --> 26:15.800]  Because we take it.
[26:15.800 --> 26:22.360]  Well, people are getting to the point of not taking it.
[26:22.360 --> 26:27.240]  And the enemy's next phase will be to frame us as terrorists or evil.
[26:27.240 --> 26:33.320]  And they will stage terror attacks and blame it on us to then discredit any resistance.
[26:33.320 --> 26:35.240]  But we need to be ahead of that and understand that.
[26:35.240 --> 26:40.440]  And there are other forms of civil disobedience and things in the threat continuum of projection
[26:40.440 --> 26:41.440]  before we to that point.
[26:41.440 --> 26:42.880]  But it is our right.
[26:42.880 --> 26:48.680]  It is our duty to resist this by every means necessary.
[26:48.680 --> 26:51.480]  And we are now at war for our very existence.
[26:51.480 --> 27:00.680]  America is on the edge of death, it's all on record, Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford.
[27:00.680 --> 27:06.480]  They were all hired a year ago and then again, six months ago to war game, how to get the
[27:06.480 --> 27:11.480]  public to stay locked down during a pandemic and how to get the public to take inoculations.
[27:11.480 --> 27:14.600]  And they talk about calling people heroes that do it.
[27:14.600 --> 27:16.920]  They talk about shaming those that don't.
[27:16.920 --> 27:19.120]  This is all been psychologically tested.
[27:19.120 --> 27:24.360]  It's all been psychologically prepared and once they get a lock down for 15 days, you
[27:24.360 --> 27:26.360]  notice now they say it's permanent.
[27:26.360 --> 27:27.360]  That's how it works.
[27:27.360 --> 27:31.720]  Oh, just put these handcuffs on, the serial killer says the woman in the parking lot and
[27:31.720 --> 27:33.400]  everything will be all right.
[27:33.400 --> 27:34.400]  No.
[27:34.400 --> 27:38.360]  Now we've already put the handcuffs on and we're in the serial killer's van.
[27:38.360 --> 27:43.120]  He's taking us to his shack in the woods to slowly torture us to death.
[27:43.120 --> 27:44.520]  That's the allegory.
[27:44.520 --> 27:45.960]  We got to bust out of this thing now.
[27:45.960 --> 27:47.440]  We got to say no now.
[27:47.440 --> 27:49.720]  We got to make a run for it now and we still can.
[27:49.720 --> 27:53.040]  Once he gets us in that basement, it's going to get a lot, lot worse, folks.
[27:53.040 --> 27:55.720]  So stop submitting DNA Force Plus.
[27:55.720 --> 28:00.000]  If you did one thing for your immune system, it would be get all the essential things.
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.480]  And that's the clean I-9 X2 or X3.
[28:02.480 --> 28:06.000]  That's the bio tricillinium that is the vitamin D3.
[28:06.000 --> 28:07.200]  That is the C that is the zinc.
[28:07.200 --> 28:10.160]  There's 13 vitamins and minerals that are essential that you die and studies show you
[28:10.160 --> 28:11.160]  really need the other ones too.
[28:11.160 --> 28:12.640]  But DNA Force goes beyond that.
[28:12.640 --> 28:17.000]  It helps get all that in the cells and out the cells with PQQ and CoQ10 of the highest
[28:17.000 --> 28:22.440]  quality sources with other ingredients that clean out the cells, that unclog them so all
[28:22.440 --> 28:24.200]  that stuff can get in.
[28:24.200 --> 28:25.200]  Viruses don't get in.
[28:25.200 --> 28:26.200]  The good stuff gets in.
[28:26.200 --> 28:29.760]  Because the NIH website says that if you have all the proper things, they can't replicate
[28:29.760 --> 28:30.760]  like they could.
[28:30.760 --> 28:33.040]  But I do this because it's essential, like oxygen, like water.
[28:33.040 --> 28:36.400]  DNA Force sold out for months 50% off out of the gates.

[28:39.400 --> 28:41.200]  DNA Force, election special.
[28:41.200 --> 28:43.400]  That's going to have to end in a week because we've got a limited supply and it was very
[28:43.400 --> 28:44.840]  hard to get the PQQ this time.
[28:44.840 --> 28:48.000]  A lot of our stuff can't get any more, a lot of our products, because the supply chain
[28:48.000 --> 28:49.000]  is broken down.
[28:49.000 --> 28:50.000]  That's part of the global's plan.

[28:51.000 --> 28:52.000]  I want to thank you all for tuning in.
[28:52.000 --> 28:53.000]  The days of hell.
[28:53.000 --> 28:54.000]  The nightmare is here.
[28:54.000 --> 29:07.000]  79 days of hell has begun.
[29:07.000 --> 29:14.080]  Multinational corporations, the mainstream media apparatus and social media tech giants
[29:14.080 --> 29:20.480]  are all now being deployed by the archaic, inbred, crooked establishment to interfere
[29:20.480 --> 29:27.480]  with the 2020 U.S. elections, remove the populist champion of the people, Donald J. Trump, and
[29:27.480 --> 29:34.320]  install the decrepit, perverted, traitorous establishment puppet, Joe Biden, along with
[29:34.320 --> 29:38.400]  rabid radical hag, Kamala Harris.
[29:38.400 --> 29:47.640]  Keep your heads on a swivel and tune in to 79days.news for tomorrow's news today.
[29:47.640 --> 30:06.320]  79days.news, America's last stand, 79days.news.
[30:06.320 --> 30:22.840]  America's last stand, and if we're able to get Trump in despite this mountain of fraud,
[30:22.840 --> 30:28.480]  all these thugs and criminals, we have to go on the offensive around these globalist
[30:28.480 --> 30:29.480]  chai-coms out.
[30:29.480 --> 30:39.160]  But I know this, I can't look at myself in the mirror if I don't resist these people.
[30:39.160 --> 30:45.840]  I've got to do a lot of thinking and a lot of praying, but I'll just tell the power
[30:45.840 --> 30:50.480]  structure in the system, those that are on the fence, you have miscalculated, you will
[30:50.480 --> 30:55.920]  not sign on with the chai-coms, you will not allow this to happen, you will not execute
[30:55.920 --> 31:00.160]  this, to stop it now.
[31:00.160 --> 31:05.640]  It's not a warning, it's not a threat, it's a statement of common damn sense.
[31:05.640 --> 31:09.320]  Are you crazy?
[31:09.320 --> 31:17.160]  All of these disconnected billionaires that control trillions like Bezos and Gates, they're
[31:17.160 --> 31:21.200]  just all China files.
[31:21.200 --> 31:26.240]  The CFR has a religion of worshiping China, and how it's going to replace us, and how
[31:26.240 --> 31:30.640]  we're bad, and how we suck, and they let them ship in fentanyl.
[31:30.640 --> 31:38.520]  One shipment they got was enough to kill everybody in America seven times over.
[31:38.520 --> 31:50.760]  We're under military attack, and they've gotten so used to censorship, so accustomed
[31:50.760 --> 31:59.160]  to being slapped around, that now they're engaged in massive fraud on every front, and
[31:59.160 --> 32:03.400]  I watch CNN, I watch Fox, and they're not saying a damn word.
[32:03.400 --> 32:08.480]  Oh, there's crazy people that say that they found 130 something thousand ballots that
[32:08.480 --> 32:09.760]  were all for Joe Biden.
[32:09.760 --> 32:15.280]  I go to the Secretary of State's office, I look at it, they were all for Biden.
[32:15.280 --> 32:24.840]  They find 20 plus thousand ballots in one area of Philadelphia, and every one of them
[32:24.840 --> 32:26.720]  was for Biden.
[32:26.720 --> 32:28.800]  They don't even mix in some Trump ones.
[32:28.800 --> 32:29.800]  That's impossible.
[32:29.800 --> 32:35.160]  If you had a hundred ballot show up that were just for Biden, you'd know there was rigged.
[32:35.160 --> 32:40.000]  20 plus thousand?
[32:40.000 --> 32:42.280]  And what did I say election night?
[32:42.280 --> 32:46.080]  I said, you got to stake out these polling places where they do the main tabulation
[32:46.080 --> 32:47.080]  centers.
[32:47.080 --> 32:49.840]  You're going to catch them showing up at 4 or 5 a.m. when everybody else is left, and
[32:49.840 --> 32:57.640]  the polls are closed, stuffing them, and oh, videos in Philadelphia, videos in Detroit,
[32:57.640 --> 33:00.720]  videos in Nevada, and who is it?
[33:00.720 --> 33:03.840]  It's mainly female lawyers, good for them.
[33:03.840 --> 33:08.560]  I guess men are too busy playing fantasy football or whatever, so it's female lawyers
[33:08.560 --> 33:14.680]  just staked out by themselves in places like Detroit at 4 a.m.
[33:14.680 --> 33:20.400]  Oh, by the way, these lawyers are being thrown out, too, even though state laws say they're
[33:20.400 --> 33:23.600]  supposed to be there as poll watchers, some are even Republican officials.
[33:23.600 --> 33:28.000]  Hell, some are state reps, some are U.S. reps, like Gozer.
[33:28.000 --> 33:33.560]  No, not Gozer the Traveler from Ghostbusters, Congressman Gozer from Arizona.
[33:33.560 --> 33:36.200]  This is really happening.
[33:36.200 --> 33:43.520]  An orgy, a smorgasbord, a sea, a plethora, a cornucopia, a wide spectrum of certified
[33:43.520 --> 33:52.880]  fraud at every level, and then my own brother-in-law, who I've never seen get mad in the many years
[33:52.880 --> 33:58.160]  of noting, calls up shaking yesterday.
[33:58.160 --> 33:59.160]  I go, what's wrong?
[33:59.160 --> 34:05.440]  He goes, I just, I had 50 ballots, he's down here at Congress, post office, he had 50.
[34:05.440 --> 34:07.680]  He was filling them out as a name, they were taking them, they didn't do anything.
[34:07.680 --> 34:09.000]  I said, why don't you videotape it?
[34:09.000 --> 34:11.400]  Well, I'm in the post office, it's a federal thing if you do that.
[34:11.400 --> 34:15.080]  I mean, he knows the law, but I mean, see, we follow the law, they don't.
[34:15.080 --> 34:18.760]  And he was shaking with anger, I said, come on the air, he goes, well, I don't really
[34:18.760 --> 34:22.320]  want to do that, I don't want to be on TV, but I said, cut an audio piece.
[34:22.320 --> 34:25.440]  Send me a voicemail, he did, we'll play it next segment.
[34:25.440 --> 34:30.800]  You can hear he's upset because he saw himself being robbed, not a car, not a TV set, you
[34:30.800 --> 34:36.960]  can replace that, but of his future and his wife's future and his future children's future,
[34:36.960 --> 34:42.840]  he saw his birthright being robbed right in front of him and that they were doing nothing
[34:42.840 --> 34:49.280]  to ask, why are you filling out 50 ballots with your name on them?
[34:49.280 --> 34:55.800]  He's watched them filling ballot after ballot out, saw the stack of them, saw him fill out
[34:55.800 --> 34:59.960]  multiple ballots.
[34:59.960 --> 35:05.760]  And now we know, we have the Project Veritas video next segment where the USPS person says,
[35:05.760 --> 35:11.040]  we're told to bat date these, if something comes in on November 4th, we say November
[35:11.040 --> 35:13.360]  2nd, so it gets counted.
[35:13.360 --> 35:17.360]  And that's what they're doing, busy beaver, he'll wise it in Texas, he's mailing them
[35:17.360 --> 35:23.680]  out to another state, guaranteed it's going to be absentees for somebody, what, Philadelphia,
[35:23.680 --> 35:24.680]  Detroit, yeah.
[35:24.680 --> 35:28.360]  And I'm not mad at Austin for not recording it, but I mean, because we already know,
[35:28.360 --> 35:33.920]  we have other people have caught this, but the big story is the news, the controlled
[35:33.920 --> 35:40.800]  corporate press, the lap dogs of our enemies, they are saying on Fox News, there's no proof
[35:40.800 --> 35:46.200]  of anything.
[35:46.200 --> 35:50.640]  And Tucker Carlson knocked it out of the park.
[35:50.640 --> 35:54.360]  He explained to the world what was going on, that they're not just trying to get their
[35:54.360 --> 35:59.520]  agenda through, they're not an American party, they want to end the system as it's known
[35:59.520 --> 36:01.800]  and create a one-party dictatorship.
[36:01.800 --> 36:06.800]  And then Tucker Carlson goes through and lists all the things they're doing, all the things
[36:06.800 --> 36:11.440]  they're announcing, packing the court, creating new states that are Democrat, like Puerto
[36:11.440 --> 36:19.400]  Rico and others, so that they can override and get new Senate seats.
[36:19.400 --> 36:30.520]  Commission commissions, endless lockdowns, IDs to travel, medical IDs.
[36:30.520 --> 36:35.200]  And then you see the graphs in all these swing states that were going for Trump and they
[36:35.200 --> 36:41.400]  closed the polls prematurely and then bam, not organic bumpy lines, but straight up perfect
[36:41.400 --> 36:46.240]  mechanical lines because they want you to know they're disenfranchising you.
[36:46.240 --> 36:50.480]  They want you to know they're going to walk right in with people that no one knows who
[36:50.480 --> 36:56.160]  they are with a passcode, but with a swipe card at 4 a.m. and come in with those ballots
[36:56.160 --> 36:58.320]  and go jam them down your throat, America.
[36:58.320 --> 37:02.480]  But when your U.S. rep shows up, the police are there, they're good Democrat operatives
[37:02.480 --> 37:05.880]  in Maricopa, they walk up with their hands on their guns and they say, I don't care what
[37:05.880 --> 37:13.440]  you say, Congressman, back off because they've seized control of the Republic.
[37:13.440 --> 37:20.960]  I'm playing all the clips when we come back, but I'm going to say this right now, whatever
[37:20.960 --> 37:24.400]  happens with Trump, he's done the right thing fighting this, but he didn't fight the censorship
[37:24.400 --> 37:28.320]  like he should have, but we're in the bed, we're in now, we're going to have to sleep
[37:28.320 --> 37:29.760]  in it.
[37:29.760 --> 37:33.200]  But if we get the point out that it's a chai con globalist takeover and it's the end
[37:33.200 --> 37:37.120]  of the country as we know it, and that it's illegal, not just that they're stealing the
[37:37.120 --> 37:41.440]  election, but when you have Chinese and foreign backing, it nullifies what's happened.
[37:41.440 --> 37:46.320]  And if we stand on that and say, you try to nullify Trump saying he was a Russian with
[37:46.320 --> 37:51.840]  no proof, we're going to nullify Biden 100%, we're going to demand Mitch McConnell, all
[37:51.840 --> 37:58.160]  of them do it and not have a fake investigation because we've got him red-handed being a chai
[37:58.160 --> 38:01.400]  con Asian, and that's what's so dangerous.
[38:01.400 --> 38:05.640]  They are going to control him and they want to scuttle this country, so Biden will definitely
[38:05.640 --> 38:10.840]  do things that screw the country up and break it up further because he's blackmailed.
[38:10.840 --> 38:16.840]  And so we cannot allow someone controlled by a foreign power to be the president.
[38:16.840 --> 38:21.040]  If you ever wanted, listen to me carefully, if you ever wanted to war game and imagine
[38:21.040 --> 38:26.080]  the end of America, this is yet, all the old timers said it was coming, all of them said
[38:26.080 --> 38:31.840]  they'd take us over with the UN, the weather underground dreamed about China occupying
[38:31.840 --> 38:36.680]  the US once they got a communist Democrat in who would trigger a race war and then China
[38:36.680 --> 38:41.280]  would come in with Latin American communists and take over a real red dawn scenario, not
[38:41.280 --> 38:43.160]  Russians but Chinese.
[38:43.160 --> 38:49.160]  And now we're literally having Democrats in the New York Times saying we want communist
[38:49.160 --> 38:54.680]  China to take over the United States.
[38:54.680 --> 39:00.800]  We want the UN to oversee our election so that if Trump refuses and can test what we
[39:00.800 --> 39:08.960]  do, we want the UN to come in and occupy America, that's now in the news.
[39:08.960 --> 39:15.800]  And what do the Antifa do all over New York, all over Oregon, all over Washington state,
[39:15.800 --> 39:26.480]  they march with communist flags, with Chinese flags, their ally and they say death to America.
[39:26.480 --> 39:30.120]  A people that will do that will do anything.
[39:30.120 --> 39:35.920]  So there's now folks surrounding these polling places everywhere, Antifa's been running
[39:35.920 --> 39:40.840]  around shooting at people and burning things and stabbing people.
[39:40.840 --> 39:45.560]  It's all coming up but you have lived to see it, I have lived to see it, the fabled world
[39:45.560 --> 39:50.920]  government UN takeover, we're under COVID lockdown, I mean it's all there, we're under
[39:50.920 --> 40:03.480]  martial law, put in place by them.
[40:03.480 --> 40:06.800]  The controlled media will talk about a few mistakes I've made over the years and obsess
[40:06.800 --> 40:11.200]  over it and say see he's a liar on purpose even though our success rate, our accuracy
[40:11.200 --> 40:16.200]  rate is way, way better than theirs, we try to tell the truth, they try to lie, they try
[40:16.200 --> 40:17.200]  to deceive.
[40:17.200 --> 40:21.720]  I'm trying to get people to realize that the globalists operate how they manipulate, how
[40:21.720 --> 40:27.520]  they bamboozle the public, I'm trying to get the public to ask questions and to not
[40:27.520 --> 40:29.240]  believe what they're told in the face.
[40:29.240 --> 40:35.120]  I'm trying to get people to research for themselves, the globalists in their controlled
[40:35.120 --> 40:40.200]  corporate press say that researching and not trusting media is evil and is a conspiracy
[40:40.200 --> 40:44.560]  theory, but again on its face that is a fraud.
[40:44.560 --> 40:48.560]  Learn everything, question info wars, add your own research to it and then decide what
[40:48.560 --> 40:52.080]  you're going to promote to others and what news sources are accurate, I believe info
[40:52.080 --> 40:54.480]  wars is the best source out there.
[40:54.480 --> 41:00.440]  I once saw a bumper sticker that read, if you want your children to listen to you, whisper
[41:00.440 --> 41:05.880]  and it's true, a lot of times if somebody's shouting and yelling, even if what they're
[41:05.880 --> 41:10.600]  talking about is important, people tend to tune it out, you know why I know that, because
[41:10.600 --> 41:15.800]  I'm Alex Jones and I've been pretty obnoxious over the years because I'm worried about
[41:15.800 --> 41:20.520]  the new world order and I read about all their plans to lock down civilization, start
[41:20.520 --> 41:24.000]  the third world and then enslave the first world.
[41:24.000 --> 41:28.160]  So I've been really, really loud and really, really aggressive and we've had a big effect
[41:28.160 --> 41:33.560]  but now it's time to think about every different angle and every different way where you get
[41:33.560 --> 41:39.240]  people to think for themselves before it's too late, the lockdown, social distancing,
[41:39.240 --> 41:46.800]  the mask is meant to end human civilization, we are under a civilization collapse weapon.
[41:46.800 --> 41:51.960]  So this is live and death, please share info wars.com and band our video and watch our
[41:51.960 --> 41:55.320]  live election coverage.
[41:55.320 --> 41:59.800]  Two info wars best selling products are now back in stock for being sold out for months.
[41:59.800 --> 42:05.000]  Biotree Selenium from the mustard seed, essential in all electrochemical activity in the cells

[42:55.080 --> 43:00.560]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your GPS
[43:00.560 --> 43:01.560]  location.
[43:01.560 --> 43:07.520]  I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-American.
[43:07.520 --> 43:12.480]  Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and on
[43:12.480 --> 43:17.720]  droids, don't just track your location, but your surfing history, where you go, who you
[43:17.720 --> 43:22.640]  talk to, your relationships and they all share the data with each other of what you're
[43:22.640 --> 43:28.280]  doing on the apps as well, including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying
[43:28.280 --> 43:34.320]  just like Siri or Alexa do and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say
[43:34.320 --> 43:36.840]  into those systems to be saved forever.
[43:36.840 --> 43:41.040]  Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based
[43:41.040 --> 43:42.160]  on information.
[43:42.160 --> 43:46.720]  This is the global Chinese communist social credit score, get your protection privacy

[44:47.400 --> 44:49.160]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[44:49.160 --> 44:50.160]  Thank you again for joining us.
[44:50.160 --> 44:53.160]  I don't know how long we're going to be on the air here.
[44:53.160 --> 44:57.640]  We're being gutted by a foreign corporate consortium backed up by a communist dictatorship
[44:57.640 --> 45:01.000]  that has a billion, 400 million slaves.
[45:01.000 --> 45:05.440]  They have millions and millions of people in death camps that Apple gets components made
[45:05.440 --> 45:07.920]  in and the news admits it and the left goes good.
[45:07.920 --> 45:08.920]  We got death camps.
[45:08.920 --> 45:14.280]  We're going to put you in them and they've got all these blue haired, green haired, pink
[45:14.280 --> 45:22.080]  haired devil worshiping, pedophile loving slobs running around on methamphetamine glowing
[45:22.080 --> 45:28.240]  in the dark, having no jobs, living off welfare, thinking the chai comms are going to give
[45:28.240 --> 45:32.480]  them a biscuit or a treat when they overthrow the United States.
[45:32.480 --> 45:39.680]  Yes, good people have stood down so long that you are now witnessing the end of the republic.
[45:39.680 --> 45:43.400]  That was a very powerful video.
[45:43.400 --> 45:48.320]  We're going to air here in a few minutes by one of the president Trump's advisor, Steve
[45:48.320 --> 45:49.320]  Cortez.
[45:49.320 --> 45:57.280]  He heads up Trump's Hispanic outreach system, says the actual math points to an Arizona
[45:57.280 --> 45:59.160]  win for President Trump.
[45:59.160 --> 46:03.840]  We're going to be getting to some of that for you here in just a little while.
[46:03.840 --> 46:09.440]  But let's just go through this stack right now and I'm going to play Congressman Gozer
[46:09.440 --> 46:11.600]  here in a moment.
[46:11.600 --> 46:18.680]  And the fact that he wasn't allowed in America County in Phoenix, but the Democrat operatives
[46:18.680 --> 46:21.700]  are in there running everything, laughing at him, in violation of federal and state
[46:21.700 --> 46:31.920]  law, by the way, suitcases with coolers rolled into Detroit Voting Center at 4 a.m., brought
[46:31.920 --> 46:40.200]  into secure voting, brought into secure voting here, amazing.
[46:40.200 --> 46:50.400]  Meanwhile, Biden Harris launched transition team website despite ballots still being counted.
[46:50.400 --> 46:55.800]  But when Trump says he's won, he's bad, but Biden's allowed to communicate online because
[46:55.800 --> 47:00.320]  he's working with the big multinational consortium that's taking over.
[47:00.320 --> 47:06.400]  You could not have a more underdog America surrounded by its enemies overwhelmed a whole
[47:06.400 --> 47:12.400]  constellation of academia and Hollywood and radical Islam and the squad and the chai comps
[47:12.400 --> 47:17.320]  and the EU all trying to bring us down.
[47:17.320 --> 47:21.400]  And a good third of Americans actually thinking they're on the winning team and rooting for
[47:21.400 --> 47:26.040]  Gigi Ping to quote, destroy Trump and save America.
[47:26.040 --> 47:28.040]  Oh, yes.
[47:28.040 --> 47:31.880]  Breaking Trump declares victory in Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, and Michigan.
[47:31.880 --> 47:36.360]  They called it fake news and blocked it last night when he said that Biden said he's
[47:36.360 --> 47:37.560]  going to win.
[47:37.560 --> 47:39.480]  That's okay.
[47:39.480 --> 47:42.520]  Protesters mobilized the pressure Trump to concede election.
[47:42.520 --> 47:47.920]  They call them protesters for stabbing and burning and doing all their regular stuff
[47:47.920 --> 47:48.920]  as well.
[47:48.920 --> 47:54.600]  There's another key article, exclusive international audit executive based on results and a review
[47:54.600 --> 47:56.120]  of numerous activities.
[47:56.120 --> 48:01.480]  The 2020 presidential election was materially corrupted in favor of Democrat Joe Biden.
[48:01.480 --> 48:06.960]  Yeah, how about we just have a redo and none of this COVID garbage.
[48:06.960 --> 48:09.360]  That was the cover for the whole thing.
[48:09.360 --> 48:10.760]  And here's the video.
[48:10.760 --> 48:16.000]  Representative Gozer joins Arizona pro Trump protest Biden and his thugs will not steal
[48:16.000 --> 48:17.000]  this election.
[48:17.000 --> 48:23.760]  And I, I like the image of hundreds of armed citizens peacefully exercising their second
[48:23.760 --> 48:32.240]  amendment demanding that people be given access like our congressman to that facility
[48:32.240 --> 48:37.680]  in the face of that horrible, evil Democrat regime that has seized control of Phoenix.
[48:37.680 --> 48:43.240]  It's that good equalization of powers, not a monopoly of power by the state.
[48:43.240 --> 48:47.920]  The UN says that civilian ownership of firearms threatens the power monopoly of the state.
[48:47.920 --> 48:49.400]  Well, power monopoly is a dictator.
[48:49.400 --> 48:52.000]  We don't want a power monopoly of the state here.
[48:52.000 --> 48:56.840]  We want checks and balances and we want the armed people inside to know what they're doing
[48:56.840 --> 49:03.000]  is illegal and let them understand that the second amendment is there for a reason.
[49:03.000 --> 49:07.080]  We don't want to use it yet, but we are not going to roll over to the new world order.
[49:07.080 --> 49:08.200]  We are not going to bow to them.
[49:08.200 --> 49:15.800]  We are not going to sell out future generations to a fate worse than death.
[49:15.800 --> 49:19.520]  That's why we have those checks and balances and a right that's not openly exercised will
[49:19.520 --> 49:21.720]  be lost.
[49:21.720 --> 49:25.600]  They're already taking our speech, they're already taking our vote away, they're already
[49:25.600 --> 49:29.600]  taking our currency away, they've already said we're not essential and they're run
[49:29.600 --> 49:31.600]  by a communist dictatorship.
[49:31.600 --> 49:34.280]  That's the team they bat for.
[49:34.280 --> 50:00.280]  Here's what those are had to say.
[50:00.280 --> 50:24.480]  Here's Steve Cortez and he's breaking down what other even nonpartisan political analysts
[50:24.480 --> 50:28.640]  are saying about the numbers from the counties they're coming in from and what they're seeing
[50:28.640 --> 50:34.760]  in the trends, this being a Republican victory, a Trump victory in Arizona.
[50:34.760 --> 50:38.240]  The actual math points to an Arizona win for President Trump.
[50:38.240 --> 50:39.240]  Here are the numbers.
[50:39.240 --> 50:41.920]  Patriots, stay confident and stay the course.
[50:41.920 --> 50:43.520]  Here it is.
[50:43.520 --> 50:47.440]  Let's talk the actual math of the Arizona vote, where it stands right now and what the
[50:47.440 --> 50:48.440]  trends are.
[50:48.440 --> 50:52.880]  There's 605,000 outstanding votes, an enormous amount of votes still to be cast.
[50:52.880 --> 50:55.680]  Right now, we have a deficit of 93,000 votes.
[50:55.680 --> 51:00.480]  Biden is clearly leading, but here's the thing, these votes that are outstanding are mostly
[51:00.480 --> 51:02.840]  election day votes.
[51:02.840 --> 51:07.640]  POTUS needs to win 58% of these remaining votes to make up for this deficit.
[51:07.640 --> 51:11.840]  Here's the election day trend in Maricopa County, which is by far the biggest county
[51:11.840 --> 51:13.920]  where Phoenix is, 62%.
[51:13.920 --> 51:18.400]  So it's very likely that we're going to eclipse the level we need and actually substantially
[51:18.400 --> 51:22.440]  win Arizona, but in addition to that, these votes are not all from Maricopa, they're also
[51:22.440 --> 51:26.840]  from the rural counties of Arizona, where we're doing much better than 62%, even into
[51:26.840 --> 51:27.920]  the 70s.
[51:27.920 --> 51:33.640]  So the math suggests strongly that we are going to win Arizona and we will know as soon
[51:33.640 --> 51:34.920]  as Friday.
[51:34.920 --> 51:39.600]  Because of that, it's reprehensible for any news organization, Fox or AP, to call this
[51:39.600 --> 51:42.000]  state at this premature juncture.
[51:42.000 --> 52:04.400]  The president is going to win Arizona.
[52:04.400 --> 52:08.280]  Because they use the U.S. Postal Service to backdate that in next segment.
[52:08.280 --> 52:12.800]  We have the key to all this, the whistleblower from the USPS saying it.
[52:12.800 --> 52:19.520]  But my brother-in-law, who is a great chemist, a good friend of mine, a very quiet person,
[52:19.520 --> 52:25.720]  I've never seen him get angry, he was visibly, audibly over the phone yesterday.
[52:25.720 --> 52:27.640]  He was in Austin, very upset.
[52:27.640 --> 52:36.080]  I asked him to tell a testimony, so Austin Rivera goes into the main big post office of
[52:36.080 --> 52:40.920]  South Congress in Austin, and he witnesses this.
[52:40.920 --> 52:41.920]  Here it is.
[52:41.920 --> 52:48.000]  I went to the post office today to drop off some packages with some products, and there's
[52:48.000 --> 52:53.160]  this guy there, real sketchy looking, and he had a grocery bag filled up with about
[52:53.160 --> 52:55.520]  50 million ballots.
[52:55.520 --> 52:59.360]  And he was taking pictures of them, taking pictures of himself and filling them out right
[52:59.360 --> 53:01.160]  there on the counter.
[53:01.160 --> 53:05.480]  And I can only see the ballot that he had in front of him on the counter and the one
[53:05.480 --> 53:10.440]  on the top of the bag, but they had the same signatures, same information on him, and he
[53:10.440 --> 53:16.320]  was just taking pictures, doing one last check, marking some things, and then putting them
[53:16.320 --> 53:18.520]  straight in the ballot box.
[53:18.520 --> 53:21.960]  Right in front of everyone, right on the counter, and no one did anything.
[53:21.960 --> 53:25.800]  And I was thinking about doing something, but all I could think about was me getting
[53:25.800 --> 53:30.280]  some kind of federal charge for interfering with the election.
[53:30.280 --> 53:36.560]  With this guy putting in, you know, 50 ballots late, because I don't think they're supposed
[53:36.560 --> 53:40.800]  to accept them now, but I mean, if you have a lot of these people doing that, it's going
[53:40.800 --> 53:41.800]  to add up.
[53:41.800 --> 53:47.800]  And the only reason you would do it is to try to overturn what the state has already
[53:47.800 --> 53:49.480]  decided in Texas is red.
[53:49.480 --> 53:54.600]  So one can only assume that these votes, all 50 of them, are going to Joe Biden.
[53:54.600 --> 54:00.160]  And I know my brother-in-law, he's very upset right there, because his whole future.
[54:00.160 --> 54:04.280]  His destiny, my destiny, his wife's destiny, it's all been stolen right in front of us,
[54:04.280 --> 54:05.280]  and we have to do something.
[54:05.280 --> 54:07.440]  That's what I'm telling the system is people are pissed.
[54:07.440 --> 54:12.360]  There's a new level of anger, and just a determination now.
[54:12.360 --> 54:16.480]  I mean, I'm so determined now, I've never felt this determined.
[54:16.480 --> 54:19.400]  I mean, it'd be one thing if this was just the Democrats stealing an election, but they're
[54:19.400 --> 54:24.240]  dirty Chinese commies, I just, I feel so ashamed of this country.
[54:24.240 --> 54:28.160]  I'm so proud of the good Americans that are left, but I am so ashamed of what we've become.
[54:28.160 --> 54:29.160]  This is pathetic.
[54:29.160 --> 54:34.120]  We've been conquered, like the Russians were in 1917, and I will not sit here and take
[54:34.120 --> 54:35.120]  it.
[54:35.120 --> 54:36.120]  You know why he was taking photos of himself?
[54:36.120 --> 54:39.160]  That's just like what Project Veritas found in Minnesota.
[54:39.160 --> 54:44.000]  He's getting paid for every one of them.
[54:44.000 --> 54:49.560]  We are only here on air facing the globalist onslaught, the DNC funded lawsuits, and everything
[54:49.560 --> 54:50.720]  that's happening because of you.
[54:50.720 --> 54:56.080]  We built the only truly multimedia independent radio TV print film organization in the world
[54:56.080 --> 54:58.040]  that promotes the truth against the globalists.
[54:58.040 --> 55:02.280]  We've had a devastating effect, we're a national treasure, you're a national treasure for supporting
[55:02.280 --> 55:03.280]  us.
[55:03.280 --> 55:06.360]  And so go get a t-shirt, go get a historic t-shirt.
[55:06.360 --> 55:10.520]  We've got a funny one that's the Biden groping a woman, it's a woman's design shirt.
[55:10.520 --> 55:11.520]  My wife really likes it.
[55:11.520 --> 55:12.520]  She sent me this gift.
[55:12.520 --> 55:13.520]  It's pretty cute.
[55:13.520 --> 55:14.520]  Here it is.
[55:14.520 --> 55:15.520]  And it's just, you know, it's a little historic thing.
[55:15.520 --> 55:18.880]  I think Trump's gonna win, but if Biden's able to steal it, we'll be probably shut down
[55:18.880 --> 55:19.880]  pretty quick.
[55:19.880 --> 55:20.880]  So it'll be historic thing to have.
[55:20.880 --> 55:24.920]  You'll be able to fight them in the third dimension on the street with graffiti, with
[55:24.920 --> 55:29.320]  handbills you hand out and with non-compliance, not paying taxes and pulling your kids out
[55:29.320 --> 55:34.360]  of the schools and just making it a full-time job to expose and fight and obstruct the criminal
[55:34.360 --> 55:36.120]  foreign takeover of America.
[55:36.120 --> 55:37.120]  We've gotten to that point.
[55:37.120 --> 55:38.240]  Biden's we're nursing home.
[55:38.240 --> 55:40.640]  I hope to retire Biden and that'd be a collector's item.
[55:40.640 --> 55:41.640]  Get it while you still can.
[55:41.640 --> 55:42.640]  We're not ordering more.
[55:42.640 --> 55:45.640]  infowarstore.com
[55:45.640 --> 55:49.960]  I get asked all the time by listeners and by the media, what am I most proud of when
[55:49.960 --> 55:50.960]  it comes to the show?
[55:50.960 --> 55:55.520]  I guess the fact that info war is more than 25 years ago, doing basic research with what
[55:55.520 --> 56:00.400]  the club of Rome and the CFR and others were actually saying, developed the hypothesis
[56:00.400 --> 56:04.960]  that the communist China had been set up to take our jobs and transfer them to China and
[56:04.960 --> 56:08.120]  then make us economically destitute and position us into debt.
[56:08.120 --> 56:13.240]  Well, now China owns the debt, now China owns Hollywood, all the one side of trading deals.
[56:13.240 --> 56:17.880]  It turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on, but again, it wasn't that hard.
[56:17.880 --> 56:22.800]  The CFR and others admitted what they were doing, but still others didn't want to focus
[56:22.800 --> 56:23.800]  on that issue.
[56:23.800 --> 56:24.800]  We did.
[56:24.800 --> 56:27.600]  And you focused on it by supporting us and info wars.
[56:27.600 --> 56:32.160]  So when you go to infowarstore.com and get all the great supplements, books, t-shirts,
[56:32.160 --> 56:36.080]  films, water filtration, air filtration, all of it, you're funding the organization that
[56:36.080 --> 56:38.160]  literally helped make up the world.
[56:38.160 --> 56:39.160]  What's really happening?
[56:39.160 --> 56:40.680]  So that's a big accomplishment for all of you.
[56:40.680 --> 56:47.600]  I want to thank you for your support.
[56:47.600 --> 56:56.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[56:56.240 --> 57:16.360]  As expected, tensions were high in Washington D.C.
[57:16.360 --> 57:23.560]  Their anti BLM mural activist, Bevelan Beatty was stabbed along with multiple proud boys,
[57:23.560 --> 57:29.280]  including proud boys leader, Enrique Tario, resulting in hospitalization due to serious
[57:29.280 --> 57:30.280]  injuries.
[57:30.280 --> 57:37.760]  Girl, they tried to, he tried to stab you stab me or stab me really badly.
[57:37.760 --> 57:40.160]  They stabbed Bevelan Beatty right now.
[57:40.160 --> 57:45.280]  Election day had been plentiful with incidents of violence and voter fraud.
[57:45.280 --> 57:47.520]  We asked to stop filming.
[57:47.520 --> 57:48.520]  To stop filming.
[57:48.520 --> 57:49.520]  Walk away.
[57:49.520 --> 57:50.520]  Walk away.
[57:50.520 --> 57:51.520]  Walk away.
[57:51.520 --> 57:52.520]  Walk away.
[57:52.520 --> 57:53.520]  Walk away.
[57:53.520 --> 57:54.520]  Walk away.
[57:54.520 --> 57:55.520]  Walk away.
[57:55.520 --> 58:00.760]  They called the sheriffs and told us to stop handing out the ballpoint pens, in which
[58:00.760 --> 58:03.720]  case those are the only ones that are actually being counted invalidated.
[58:03.720 --> 58:07.600]  I use your pen and then I put it back to you and I said, this is somebody can do it.
[58:07.600 --> 58:08.600]  Yes.
[58:08.600 --> 58:09.600]  Yes.
[58:09.600 --> 58:11.800]  And so we know that and we've been telling them you need to use a ballpoint pen, not the
[58:11.800 --> 58:14.800]  sharpie, and now those are getting invalidated.
[58:14.800 --> 58:19.360]  So people are coming here to vote for Donald Trump and those votes are all getting invalidated.
[58:19.360 --> 58:20.560]  That's what's going on.
[58:20.560 --> 58:26.120]  Voter machines were down in Scranton, Pennsylvania and an unidentified man was filmed taking
[58:26.120 --> 58:30.600]  an official ballot box away from a polling place in Philadelphia.
[58:30.600 --> 58:36.160]  And as the votes were tallied, Biden's states were easily called while Trump's hung in
[58:36.160 --> 58:38.040]  the balance for hours.
[58:38.040 --> 58:43.640]  And as a victory looked obvious for Trump, rather than count the votes, Democrat turf
[58:43.640 --> 58:49.600]  in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota called it a night while Arizona
[58:49.600 --> 58:54.360]  controversially flipped to Biden warranting reactions from both parties.
[58:54.360 --> 58:55.360]  Keep the faith guys.
[58:55.360 --> 58:56.360]  We're going to win this.
[58:56.360 --> 58:57.360]  Thank you.
[58:57.360 --> 58:58.360]  Thank you.
[58:58.360 --> 58:59.360]  Thank you.
[58:59.360 --> 59:00.360]  Your faces is great.
[59:00.360 --> 59:01.360]  Let's walk over here.
[59:01.360 --> 59:14.880]  So if you look and you see Arizona, we have a lot of life in that and somebody said somebody
[59:14.880 --> 59:20.040]  declared that it was a victory for and maybe it will be, I mean, that's possible.
[59:20.040 --> 59:24.440]  But certainly there were a lot of votes out there that we could get because we're now
[59:24.440 --> 59:27.000]  just coming into what they call Trump territory.
[59:27.000 --> 59:28.200]  I don't know what you call it.
[59:28.200 --> 59:32.560]  But these were friendly Trump voters and that could be overturned.
[59:32.560 --> 59:35.080]  The gentleman that called it, I watched tonight.
[59:35.080 --> 59:38.320]  He said, well, we think it's fairly unlikely that he could catch.
[59:38.320 --> 59:40.880]  Well, fairly unlikely.
[59:40.880 --> 59:46.880]  And the mockingbird media immediately reacted, spinning webs of propaganda against Trump's
[59:46.880 --> 59:48.640]  legitimate concerns.
[59:48.640 --> 59:53.840]  If somehow they managed to stumble into the Supreme Court, did any of you guys trust Uncle
[59:53.840 --> 59:59.360]  Clarence and Amy Coney Barrett and those guys to actually follow the letter of the law?
[59:59.360 --> 1:00:00.360]  No.
[1:00:00.360 --> 1:00:05.120]  I mean, it is a completely politicized Supreme Court that you can't just trust that they're
[1:00:05.120 --> 1:00:06.360]  going to do the right thing.
[1:00:06.360 --> 1:00:12.200]  This is a mostly meaningless event tonight that is as dark as everyone has said it is.
[1:00:12.200 --> 1:00:15.240]  It is as disgraceful as everyone has said it is.
[1:00:15.240 --> 1:00:19.440]  But like so much of Trump, it is mostly meaningless.
[1:00:19.440 --> 1:00:22.920]  I think one thing that's underappreciated about what the president is doing here is that the
[1:00:22.920 --> 1:00:26.400]  president would not have to do that if he thought he was going to win the election.
[1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:30.720]  The only reason you come out and say, I'm winning Georgia, I won North Carolina, I won
[1:00:30.720 --> 1:00:34.160]  Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, all these places, is because you haven't.
[1:00:34.160 --> 1:00:37.080]  And you have to assert it because it's not otherwise true.
[1:00:37.080 --> 1:00:42.360]  And as America slept, hundreds of thousands of votes were dumped in Biden's favor.
[1:00:42.360 --> 1:00:48.200]  In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the count was delayed until 3.30 a.m. and President Trump
[1:00:48.200 --> 1:00:52.880]  had a healthy lead, suddenly Biden had a 4.1 lead.
[1:00:52.880 --> 1:00:55.320]  It suddenly appeared on a zip drive.
[1:00:55.320 --> 1:01:04.560]  Give it an accuracy, and transparency.
[1:01:04.560 --> 1:01:11.360]  And in Michigan, over 100,000 votes went to Biden, while zero went to any other presidential
[1:01:11.360 --> 1:01:17.440]  contender, including Donald Trump, statistical impossibilities, stinking of fraud.
[1:01:17.440 --> 1:01:23.400]  They would all have you believe that the phishing for ballot scam is just business as usual.
[1:01:23.400 --> 1:01:30.280]  But even the closest election in modern history between JFK and Nixon in 1960 was called by
[1:01:30.280 --> 1:01:32.360]  7 a.m. the next morning.
[1:01:32.360 --> 1:01:38.120]  And even that race was marred by fraud, but nowhere near the presidential election of
[1:01:38.120 --> 1:01:52.960]  2020, John Bowne reporting.
[1:01:52.960 --> 1:02:11.880]  The
[1:02:11.880 --> 1:02:16.400]  in the cells and out the cells with PQQ and CoQ10 of the highest quality sources with
[1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:21.640]  other ingredients that clean out the cells, that unclog them so all that stuff can get
[1:02:21.640 --> 1:02:22.640]  in.
[1:02:22.640 --> 1:02:23.640]  Viruses don't get in.
[1:02:23.640 --> 1:02:24.640]  The good stuff gets in.
[1:02:24.640 --> 1:02:27.960]  As the NIH website says, that if you have all the proper things, they can't replicate
[1:02:27.960 --> 1:02:28.960]  like they could.
[1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:31.240]  But I do this because it's essential, like oxygen, like water.
[1:02:31.240 --> 1:02:35.640]  DNA Force sold out for months, 50% off out of the gates, triple Patriot points, free
[1:02:35.640 --> 1:02:37.640]  shipping, infowarstore.com.
[1:02:37.640 --> 1:02:40.840]  DNA Force, election special, that's going to have to end in a week because we had a
[1:02:40.840 --> 1:02:43.120]  supply and it was very hard to get the PQQ this time.
[1:02:43.120 --> 1:02:46.240]  A lot of our stuff can't get any more out of our products because the supply chain's
[1:02:46.240 --> 1:02:50.840]  broken down, that's part of the global's plan, infowarstore.com or CRIPLE-8253-3139.
[1:02:50.840 --> 1:02:52.840]  I want to thank you all for tuning in.
[1:02:52.840 --> 1:03:12.840]  Well, Amanda Milius is here with us for the rest of the hour and I'm a big fan of her
[1:03:12.840 --> 1:03:13.840]  dad.
[1:03:13.840 --> 1:03:16.840]  I'm not starstruck about anybody in Hollywood.
[1:03:16.840 --> 1:03:17.840]  I can't stand any of it.
[1:03:17.840 --> 1:03:22.600]  Except I like Stanley Kubrick and I really like your dad and I like the great work you've
[1:03:22.600 --> 1:03:25.600]  done in the Trump administration and this new film you've made.
[1:03:25.600 --> 1:03:29.760]  That's why we played the Anvil of Crom coming in, not the second tone-an movie, but the
[1:03:29.760 --> 1:03:33.280]  first one your dad made that they call fascist and politically incorrect.
[1:03:33.280 --> 1:03:35.240]  It's a beautiful film, a true masterpiece.
[1:03:35.240 --> 1:03:38.480]  I know that Alderstone was the main writer on that.
[1:03:38.480 --> 1:03:39.480]  But go ahead.
[1:03:39.480 --> 1:03:41.320]  Well, I mean, that's debatable.
[1:03:41.320 --> 1:03:42.320]  We like to...
[1:03:42.320 --> 1:03:43.320]  You're the expert.
[1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:44.320]  You're the expert.
[1:03:44.320 --> 1:03:46.840]  We love all of her, but yeah, I know my dad...
[1:03:46.840 --> 1:03:48.480]  I think you're more definitive on this than me.
[1:03:48.480 --> 1:03:49.480]  I've got...
[1:03:49.480 --> 1:03:51.480]  I have, I suppose, an agenda, though.
[1:03:51.480 --> 1:03:56.680]  I mean, I'm very promilius in this fight, but no, they're funny guys, Oliver and my
[1:03:56.680 --> 1:03:57.680]  dad.
[1:03:57.680 --> 1:04:00.680]  I'm glad your boyfriend corrected me, because I'm always saying jealous.
[1:04:00.680 --> 1:04:02.840]  If I'm such a big fan, I should know it's milious.
[1:04:02.840 --> 1:04:03.840]  Yes, it's milious.
[1:04:03.840 --> 1:04:05.480]  It's a hard time with it, but...
[1:04:05.480 --> 1:04:07.120]  Well, we're here on a hellish day.
[1:04:07.120 --> 1:04:08.120]  Yes.
[1:04:08.120 --> 1:04:12.400]  A day of doom is here, false of doom, but his name is Joe Biden.
[1:04:12.400 --> 1:04:16.840]  And you have just filmed this film that they tried to censor on Amazon a bunch of places.
[1:04:16.840 --> 1:04:19.800]  It's the plot against the president, which is a plot against America.
[1:04:19.800 --> 1:04:22.640]  Here is the trailer.
[1:04:22.640 --> 1:04:25.480]  But you can make a whole movie on the Russiagate hoax.
[1:04:25.480 --> 1:04:32.480]  It's all documented.
[1:04:32.480 --> 1:04:36.120]  There was an illusion being created using the most awesome tools and the greatest tricks
[1:04:36.120 --> 1:04:39.720]  that the American intelligence community had learned to use against our enemies.
[1:04:39.720 --> 1:04:42.680]  Now it was being deployed against the American people and our president.
[1:04:42.680 --> 1:04:48.440]  This is the biggest political scandal in modern history, which makes Watergate look like a
[1:04:48.440 --> 1:04:49.440]  tiff.
[1:04:49.440 --> 1:04:51.800]  The FBI director has no credibility.
[1:04:51.800 --> 1:04:56.920]  The left used to not trust the FBI, and now they love them.
[1:04:56.920 --> 1:04:59.560]  This can happen to General Michael T. Flynn.
[1:04:59.560 --> 1:05:03.720]  Imagine what they do to anybody who has a single strike against them.
[1:05:03.720 --> 1:05:06.120]  35 Russian diplomats in the U.S. expelled.
[1:05:06.120 --> 1:05:10.440]  The prosecution of General Flynn wasn't a pursuit of criminal activity.
[1:05:10.440 --> 1:05:11.960]  It was a setup.
[1:05:11.960 --> 1:05:17.080]  Flynn actually had details, so he was talking about going after people's budgets.
[1:05:17.080 --> 1:05:18.640]  They were terrified.
[1:05:18.640 --> 1:05:20.760]  It didn't start as neutral.
[1:05:20.760 --> 1:05:23.520]  Media hasn't been neutral all its life.
[1:05:23.520 --> 1:05:27.840]  The two faces of Hillary Clinton are coming out, in fact, through WikiLeaks, that she
[1:05:27.840 --> 1:05:32.400]  says one thing, and, oh, no.
[1:05:32.400 --> 1:05:36.360]  They worked hand in glove with Comey to try to delegitimize Trump.
[1:05:36.360 --> 1:05:38.160]  They were not there to tell the truth.
[1:05:38.160 --> 1:05:41.880]  A political dirty trick is being carried out by our intelligence community.
[1:05:41.880 --> 1:05:46.880]  Honestly, none of us really know, sort of holistically, what you think about this dossier.
[1:05:46.880 --> 1:05:47.880]  They went into Congress.
[1:05:47.880 --> 1:05:49.760]  They said, there's nothing here.
[1:05:49.760 --> 1:05:50.760]  Doesn't matter.
[1:05:50.760 --> 1:05:52.080]  We'll keep going with FISA.
[1:05:52.080 --> 1:05:54.040]  We'll keep going with the investigation.
[1:05:54.040 --> 1:05:59.320]  And more importantly, we will go on TV, day in and day out, and lie to the American people
[1:05:59.320 --> 1:06:01.760]  to their face, and nothing's going to happen to us.
[1:06:01.760 --> 1:06:06.400]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread, and the military apparatus of this
[1:06:06.400 --> 1:06:12.920]  country is about to be handed over to SCUM, who are beholden to SCUM, Russian SCUM.
[1:06:12.920 --> 1:06:19.040]  We had not one person claim that they had or had seen evidence of Trump colluding with
[1:06:19.040 --> 1:06:20.040]  the Russians.
[1:06:20.040 --> 1:06:23.000]  Devin Nunes was the hero in the forest.
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:24.360]  He was alone.
[1:06:24.360 --> 1:06:25.360]  He was mocked.
[1:06:25.360 --> 1:06:26.360]  He was attacked.
[1:06:26.360 --> 1:06:31.640]  Devin Nunes was subject to such scorn for saying the conclusions that we brought forth
[1:06:31.640 --> 1:06:34.440]  in that report, which all proved to be true.
[1:06:34.440 --> 1:06:40.080]  Russiagate was a false story to target their political opposition, to carry out their insurance
[1:06:40.080 --> 1:06:41.080]  policies.
[1:06:41.080 --> 1:06:42.440]  I believe this is a conspiracy.
[1:06:42.440 --> 1:06:46.240]  These guys have perpetrated the greatest crime against the American people ever seen.
[1:06:46.240 --> 1:06:47.760]  It was a coup d'etat.
[1:06:47.760 --> 1:06:50.000]  This is how sick and twisted these people are.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:54.800]  I recently confirmed that on numerous occasions, the intelligence community incidentally collected
[1:06:54.800 --> 1:06:58.680]  information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition.
[1:06:58.680 --> 1:07:04.640]  It was shocking to see some of the overclassification that was done to hide either corruption or
[1:07:04.640 --> 1:07:09.920]  abuse of authority, and just to make sure certain agencies didn't look bad.
[1:07:09.920 --> 1:07:13.680]  We have a peaceful transition of power process.
[1:07:13.680 --> 1:07:14.680]  That's not what happened.
[1:07:14.680 --> 1:07:15.680]  There were more meetings.
[1:07:15.680 --> 1:07:16.680]  There were more leaks.
[1:07:16.680 --> 1:07:18.440]  There were more attacks.
[1:07:18.440 --> 1:07:23.640]  The thing that they were investigating the Trump campaign for is what they themselves
[1:07:23.640 --> 1:07:28.000]  were doing, not just the Democratic Party and their operatives, but also the FBI.
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:32.320]  I were writing about the timeframe that we lived in, that we're living in now.
[1:07:32.320 --> 1:07:34.840]  I would say it wasn't supposed to happen.
[1:07:34.840 --> 1:07:36.720]  They weren't supposed to know.
[1:07:36.720 --> 1:07:41.240]  The entire time this was going on, they thought this was going to be what sunk the Donald
[1:07:41.240 --> 1:07:45.360]  Trump presidency, and they were just looking for the golden goose, and they still haven't
[1:07:45.360 --> 1:07:47.800]  found it because it doesn't exist.
[1:07:47.800 --> 1:07:50.840]  Amanda Milius is here with us.
[1:07:50.840 --> 1:07:53.960]  She's worked for the Trump administration, state department, or dad as one of the most
[1:07:53.960 --> 1:08:01.000]  conservative best directors out there, and the Dirty Harry movies, Red Dawn, the original
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:02.720]  Conan, and so much more.
[1:08:02.720 --> 1:08:08.640]  I know later he's going to be watching this once we're not live, because I guess you tell
[1:08:08.640 --> 1:08:13.200]  me he doesn't know how to work the machine, but here we are in the middle of this insanity.
[1:08:13.200 --> 1:08:14.440]  This is a microcosm.
[1:08:14.440 --> 1:08:16.440]  Some could say, well, the whole Russiagate thing is old news.
[1:08:16.440 --> 1:08:17.440]  No, it's not.
[1:08:17.440 --> 1:08:21.200]  You have the Comey rule with a huge $100 million budget or whatever it is.
[1:08:21.200 --> 1:08:22.200]  No one watched it.
[1:08:22.200 --> 1:08:24.800]  Your film that they tried to block on Amazon is now number one.
[1:08:24.800 --> 1:08:29.040]  It's probably already had more viewers that puts out the true story than the very same
[1:08:29.040 --> 1:08:34.040]  corrupt intelligence agencies that are globalists that sold us out to China are now engaged
[1:08:34.040 --> 1:08:35.280]  in the giant steal right now.
[1:08:35.280 --> 1:08:36.760]  So where do you want to take this?
[1:08:36.760 --> 1:08:38.280]  I love having you here in studio.
[1:08:38.280 --> 1:08:39.680]  Well, thank you so much for having me.
[1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:43.440]  And yes, I mean, it is relevant now because basically we're watching the exact same thing
[1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:44.440]  unfold.
[1:08:44.440 --> 1:08:50.360]  If you look at the motivations behind Russiagate and what's happening right now, it's always
[1:08:50.360 --> 1:08:52.080]  an effort to delegitimize.
[1:08:52.080 --> 1:08:53.960]  I actually have a weird point of view on this.
[1:08:53.960 --> 1:08:58.240]  I actually think that what's happening is essentially, I think a lot of this is about
[1:08:58.240 --> 1:09:00.080]  trying to get their side angry.
[1:09:00.080 --> 1:09:01.880]  I know a lot of our people are freaked out.
[1:09:01.880 --> 1:09:03.080]  People are like, what's going to happen?
[1:09:03.080 --> 1:09:07.840]  I think that this is the step one into delegitimizing the second Trump term.
[1:09:07.840 --> 1:09:12.440]  I think that they want it to make it look like we stole it when really they're the ones
[1:09:12.440 --> 1:09:14.920]  doing all the fraud and they're the ones trying to do all that.
[1:09:14.920 --> 1:09:15.920]  That's right.
[1:09:15.920 --> 1:09:17.520]  It's a moment he's about to go up to 270.
[1:09:17.520 --> 1:09:22.520]  They block it with Biden way ahead of him to create the perception so that when Trump
[1:09:22.520 --> 1:09:27.080]  with proof shows the fraud, takes the fraud away from them in a tug of war, they go totally
[1:09:27.080 --> 1:09:28.080]  crazy.
[1:09:28.080 --> 1:09:31.760]  There's a reason all the cities are boarded up and it's not for our people.
[1:09:31.760 --> 1:09:34.360]  We've got, stop the steal is happening right now.
[1:09:34.360 --> 1:09:38.360]  All the influencers, all the MAGA influencers are coming together and getting along.
[1:09:38.360 --> 1:09:41.680]  Everybody's coming together and showing up in all the different contested states around
[1:09:41.680 --> 1:09:47.240]  the country and bringing huge crowds with them that demand a clean election.
[1:09:47.240 --> 1:09:48.240]  Nobody's hurting anybody.
[1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:49.960]  Nobody's lighting anything on fire.
[1:09:49.960 --> 1:09:50.960]  Nobody's doing that.
[1:09:50.960 --> 1:09:55.120]  The boarded up windows and stores are because of what's going to happen next.
[1:09:55.120 --> 1:09:57.320]  I think that that's what they're anticipating.
[1:09:57.320 --> 1:10:02.240]  Because your dad, who I guess envisioned and predicted all this because I saw the documentary
[1:10:02.240 --> 1:10:03.240]  about him years ago.
[1:10:03.240 --> 1:10:04.240]  It's amazing.
[1:10:04.240 --> 1:10:07.600]  It's just called Milius where he really was worried about all this and saw this, I guess
[1:10:07.600 --> 1:10:10.240]  because he was out in California around the commies or in Hollywood.
[1:10:10.240 --> 1:10:14.800]  How the hell was he obsessed with this, the takedown of America and things and it was
[1:10:14.800 --> 1:10:16.960]  proven like 30 years before he was right?
[1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:20.920]  Well, I mean, Red Dawn is what, you know, it's him filmed from the 80s that everybody
[1:10:20.920 --> 1:10:26.920]  is even in the last year, it's had this total nostalgic resurgence because people feel like
[1:10:26.920 --> 1:10:30.760]  in 2020, we're living in Red Dawn, we're fighting for our country down to like tooth
[1:10:30.760 --> 1:10:31.760]  and nail.
[1:10:31.760 --> 1:10:36.440]  I mean, I think a lot of people in their minds when they envision the future and they're
[1:10:36.440 --> 1:10:42.160]  like, see the direction things are going, they imagine a kind of 2020 Red Dawn scenario.
[1:10:42.160 --> 1:10:46.640]  I think it's very, I mean, it's pressing and of course, if you're, if you're living in
[1:10:46.640 --> 1:10:50.840]  and you know, it's weird, that jacket back in the two seconds that I had, I'm not into
[1:10:50.840 --> 1:10:51.840]  memorabilia.
[1:10:51.840 --> 1:10:53.080]  I was given that very jacket right there.
[1:10:53.080 --> 1:10:54.080]  We'll bring in our next segment.
[1:10:54.080 --> 1:10:58.520]  So it's, it's like weird, the synchronicity, synchronicity.
[1:10:58.520 --> 1:10:59.520]  It's synchronicity.
[1:10:59.520 --> 1:11:03.840]  I mean, you were a huge part of why I left Hollywood.
[1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:08.000]  I was listening to Info Wars all the time and I left and I went and I volunteered in
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  2016 in Nevada, which by the way, Nevada is, is a huge battleground for us right now in
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:17.360]  Nevada is where everything's happening and, and, and, and I ended up leaving Hollywood
[1:11:17.360 --> 1:11:20.560]  completely and joining the Trump administration, working at the State Department and a lot
[1:11:20.560 --> 1:11:21.560]  of proud is your family.
[1:11:21.560 --> 1:11:25.160]  And they're, they're, they're pretty happy, you had some, you already been successful
[1:11:25.160 --> 1:11:26.160]  in Hollywood.
[1:11:26.160 --> 1:11:28.760]  I admire the fact that you, you, you, you, you cut bait with those guys.
[1:11:28.760 --> 1:11:30.560]  I did because who could possibly serve.
[1:11:30.560 --> 1:11:32.320]  I mean, I would never go back to Los Angeles.
[1:11:32.320 --> 1:11:34.160]  It's just, we've, we've got to build the wall.
[1:11:34.160 --> 1:11:35.160]  You escaped early.
[1:11:35.160 --> 1:11:36.160]  You were smart.
[1:11:36.160 --> 1:11:37.160]  Yeah.
[1:11:37.160 --> 1:11:38.160]  I got out in 2016.
[1:11:38.160 --> 1:11:39.160]  Women's intuition.
[1:11:39.160 --> 1:11:40.160]  It's women's intuition and a lot of Info Wars.
[1:11:40.160 --> 1:11:44.200]  But that's my point in saying that is that there's a reason that they're so afraid of
[1:11:44.200 --> 1:11:48.960]  you and that they were so hell bent on silencing you, pulling you off as many social media
[1:11:48.960 --> 1:11:52.840]  platforms as possible, you and people that motivate other people.
[1:11:52.840 --> 1:11:53.840]  You know why?
[1:11:53.840 --> 1:11:57.360]  Because of this moment we're in right now because my whole life has been since I was
[1:11:57.360 --> 1:11:59.960]  politically aware of 30 years, building to this point.
[1:11:59.960 --> 1:12:00.960]  Yes, that's right.
[1:12:00.960 --> 1:12:03.880]  And, and, and all of us now, I mean, we are now in the zeitgeist.
[1:12:03.880 --> 1:12:04.880]  We're in the fulcrum.
[1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:05.880]  This is the day.
[1:12:05.880 --> 1:12:08.640]  That's, this is, this is why I kind of can't even believe it's the synchronicity of being
[1:12:08.640 --> 1:12:11.480]  on with you today because this is the moment because you couldn't, you were going to come
[1:12:11.480 --> 1:12:13.480]  a few weeks ago when the film first came out, right?
[1:12:13.480 --> 1:12:14.480]  Couldn't.
[1:12:14.480 --> 1:12:15.480]  And now it's the perfect time.
[1:12:15.480 --> 1:12:16.480]  It's literally perfect timing.
[1:12:16.480 --> 1:12:18.680]  I was in Texas for an election thing and here we are.
[1:12:18.680 --> 1:12:24.800]  So, I mean, it's, yeah, it's, it's very interesting that all of the people who, who could bring
[1:12:24.800 --> 1:12:29.560]  the biggest crowds who on the right, the people who could motivate the MAGA community, those
[1:12:29.560 --> 1:12:32.800]  are the people that the sensors and the tech giants went after first.
[1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:37.400]  And now we see why now we, now I've got, you know, a lot of people have told me, you know,
[1:12:37.400 --> 1:12:38.400]  you're going on info worse tomorrow.
[1:12:38.400 --> 1:12:40.480]  There's a lot of messages we need to get out to people.
[1:12:40.480 --> 1:12:46.440]  For example, people need to get their friends and their, their like-minded on alternative
[1:12:46.440 --> 1:12:47.940]  social media platforms.
[1:12:47.940 --> 1:12:49.520]  Let's talk about how we fight back down.
[1:12:49.520 --> 1:12:50.520]  It's going to be hard.
[1:12:50.520 --> 1:12:51.520]  We're the man.
[1:12:51.520 --> 1:13:06.000]  The days of hell, the nightmare is here 79 days of hell has begun multinational corporations,
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:13.080]  the mainstream media apparatus and social media tech giants are all now being deployed
[1:13:13.080 --> 1:13:20.440]  by the archaic inbred crooked establishment to interfere with the 2020 US elections, remove
[1:13:20.440 --> 1:13:26.840]  the populist champion of the people, Donald J. Trump and install the decrepit perverted
[1:13:26.840 --> 1:13:35.280]  traitorous establishment puppet Joe Biden along with rabid radical hag Kamala Harris.
[1:13:35.280 --> 1:13:44.560]  Keep your heads on a swivel and tune in to 79 days.news for tomorrow's news today 79
[1:13:44.560 --> 1:13:52.000]  days.news America's last stand 79 days.news.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  Look it up for yourself.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:58.080]  The head of the Davos group issued a report more than six months ago calling for world
[1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:03.680]  government to be openly established to respond to COVID-19 and the COVID-19 was a blessing
[1:14:03.680 --> 1:14:06.960]  to lower the planet's carbon footprint.
[1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:12.640]  Since then Prince Charles and countless others have come out and said the exact same thing.
[1:14:12.640 --> 1:14:19.480]  The most ancient form of total war is called siege and that's when you cut people off from
[1:14:19.480 --> 1:14:20.480]  their resources.
[1:14:20.480 --> 1:14:25.480]  That's when you lock them down and this isn't siege to make us capitulate to the globalist
[1:14:25.480 --> 1:14:26.680]  or just get rid of Donald Trump.
[1:14:26.680 --> 1:14:27.680]  That's only part of it.
[1:14:27.680 --> 1:14:31.880]  This is siege to literally train us to be poor and to get us into deep debt.
[1:14:31.880 --> 1:14:37.720]  So then the globalist social engineers can dictate how we live our lives with the social
[1:14:37.720 --> 1:14:39.800]  credit score surveillance grid.
[1:14:39.800 --> 1:14:43.800]  You've heard the U.S. Army saying our job is to kill people and break things.
[1:14:43.800 --> 1:14:45.520]  Well that's what the lockdown's doing.
[1:14:45.520 --> 1:14:49.040]  It's starving the third world, millions and millions of debt, it's breaking down the supply
[1:14:49.040 --> 1:14:50.040]  chain in society.
[1:14:50.040 --> 1:15:19.040]  That's what it's about, it's their mission.
[1:15:19.040 --> 1:15:24.400]  And that was her father who came out with the film, John Melis.
[1:15:24.400 --> 1:15:26.640]  And she's here with us, Amanda Milius.
[1:15:26.640 --> 1:15:32.600]  Right now let's go ahead and play a clip from that famous film where we now see China backing
[1:15:32.600 --> 1:15:36.800]  a political takeover by stealing an election, something they couldn't do militarily, they're
[1:15:36.800 --> 1:15:52.840]  doing through economic and cultural and political fraud.
[1:15:52.840 --> 1:16:22.400]  Hey, could you find my dad Tom Eckerd, I'm Jett.
[1:16:22.400 --> 1:16:39.840]  This is the man who's watching there, and we're joking around, they want this for America.
[1:16:39.840 --> 1:16:57.200]  Get him out.
[1:16:57.200 --> 1:17:04.600]  Oh, it's going to be great.
[1:17:04.600 --> 1:17:06.880]  Daddy!?
[1:17:06.880 --> 1:17:10.880]  Maddie, yet?
[1:17:10.880 --> 1:17:14.880]  Daddy?
[1:17:14.880 --> 1:17:18.880]  Don't talk, don't say anything.
[1:17:18.880 --> 1:17:22.880]  Let me look at you.
[1:17:22.880 --> 1:17:25.880]  Yeah, I knew I was right.
[1:17:25.880 --> 1:17:29.880]  I knew it. You're alive.
[1:17:29.880 --> 1:17:32.880]  I was tough on both of you.
[1:17:32.880 --> 1:17:36.880]  I did things that made you...
[1:17:36.880 --> 1:17:39.880]  that made you hate me sometimes.
[1:17:39.880 --> 1:17:43.880]  But you understand now, don't you?
[1:17:43.880 --> 1:17:46.880]  What happened, Dad?
[1:17:46.880 --> 1:17:48.880]  Why are you here? What'd they do?
[1:17:48.880 --> 1:17:52.880]  It doesn't matter.
[1:17:52.880 --> 1:17:55.880]  One way or another.
[1:17:55.880 --> 1:17:58.880]  One reason or another. We're all gone.
[1:17:58.880 --> 1:18:03.880]  It's all gone.
[1:18:03.880 --> 1:18:06.880]  Remember?
[1:18:06.880 --> 1:18:11.880]  Remember when you used to go in the park and play?
[1:18:11.880 --> 1:18:14.880]  I used to put you on the swings.
[1:18:14.880 --> 1:18:17.880]  And both of you were...
[1:18:17.880 --> 1:18:24.880]  so damn little, Dad.
[1:18:24.880 --> 1:18:28.880]  I remember. I remember all of it.
[1:18:28.880 --> 1:18:31.880]  Well, I ain't gonna be around to pick you up when you fall now.
[1:18:31.880 --> 1:18:36.880]  Both of you gotta take care of each other now.
[1:18:36.880 --> 1:18:38.880]  I'm never seeing you, Dad.
[1:18:38.880 --> 1:18:41.880]  Yes, you will. I don't want to hear that, Maddie.
[1:18:41.880 --> 1:18:55.880]  What happened to Mom, Dad? Where is she?
[1:18:55.880 --> 1:18:58.880]  I can't afford to be crying anymore now.
[1:18:58.880 --> 1:19:03.880]  I won't either one of you ever, ever cry for me again.
[1:19:03.880 --> 1:19:08.880]  I'll ever do it. Not as long as you live.
[1:19:08.880 --> 1:19:13.880]  Where's my dad, Mr. Eckhart?
[1:19:13.880 --> 1:19:20.880]  I don't know, son.
[1:19:20.880 --> 1:19:23.880]  Don't get going now.
[1:19:23.880 --> 1:19:33.880]  Get out before they find you.
[1:19:33.880 --> 1:19:36.880]  I love you.
[1:19:36.880 --> 1:19:57.880]  I know you do, son. I love you, too.
[1:19:57.880 --> 1:20:07.880]  I love you.
[1:20:07.880 --> 1:20:12.880]  Now, that's a dystopic vision of John Milius, your incredibly patriotic father.
[1:20:12.880 --> 1:20:14.880]  I mean, is there anybody more right-wing?
[1:20:14.880 --> 1:20:16.880]  I mean, Tom Selleck was kind of halfway.
[1:20:16.880 --> 1:20:20.880]  I mean, you were the only guy that was ever patriotic in modern history in Hollywood.
[1:20:20.880 --> 1:20:23.880]  Absolutely. And, you know, I think he...
[1:20:23.880 --> 1:20:27.880]  There was a different time. I mean, people always...
[1:20:27.880 --> 1:20:29.880]  There was a lot of tension between his politics and mainstream Hollywood, obviously.
[1:20:29.880 --> 1:20:32.880]  But he still made movies. These days, none of those movies would be made,
[1:20:32.880 --> 1:20:34.880]  because he would have been completely canceled.
[1:20:34.880 --> 1:20:37.880]  I mean, frankly, he was pretty canceled after Red Dawn.
[1:20:37.880 --> 1:20:38.880]  I mean, he was the most...
[1:20:38.880 --> 1:20:40.880]  Now, let's pull up some photos of John Milius.
[1:20:40.880 --> 1:20:41.880]  Oh, Lord.
[1:20:41.880 --> 1:20:45.880]  With guns, and Schwarzenegger, and Clint Eastwood. They're amazing photos.
[1:20:45.880 --> 1:20:47.880]  I mean, I am a fan of your dad. I am a big fan.
[1:20:47.880 --> 1:20:50.880]  I can't wait to get you guys together, because it's going to be like the singularity.
[1:20:50.880 --> 1:20:53.880]  It's going to be like the same guy in the mirror. It's...
[1:20:53.880 --> 1:20:55.880]  He loves you. He loves you.
[1:20:55.880 --> 1:20:57.880]  Anytime we get in the car, he wants to listen to all of us.
[1:20:57.880 --> 1:20:59.880]  But all the stuff he wrote, dirty, hairy, all of us, just a great patriot.
[1:20:59.880 --> 1:21:02.880]  Yes, absolutely. And I mean, and so in recent years,
[1:21:02.880 --> 1:21:06.880]  what you realize is that all of these amazing movies that have motivated so many people...
[1:21:06.880 --> 1:21:08.880]  Again, it's the motivation factor.
[1:21:08.880 --> 1:21:12.880]  So many people said that they joined the armed forces because of a movie that my dad made,
[1:21:12.880 --> 1:21:16.880]  or, you know, that that turned them on to politics or whatever it was.
[1:21:16.880 --> 1:21:20.880]  And that's what they want to do. They want to silence anybody that's good at communicating
[1:21:20.880 --> 1:21:23.880]  with America and with that Americana spirit.
[1:21:23.880 --> 1:21:24.880]  They're scared of that power.
[1:21:24.880 --> 1:21:25.880]  Yes.
[1:21:25.880 --> 1:21:27.880]  Because that's an alternate system of their globalist system.
[1:21:27.880 --> 1:21:29.880]  Exactly. Yeah, and he was the one...
[1:21:29.880 --> 1:21:32.880]  When I was a kid, I watched the Chinese Takeover of Hollywood,
[1:21:32.880 --> 1:21:35.880]  and probably that'll have something to do with the next documentary that I do
[1:21:35.880 --> 1:21:38.880]  after Plot Against the President kind of runs its course.
[1:21:38.880 --> 1:21:41.880]  But the China influence I saw, because, you know,
[1:21:41.880 --> 1:21:45.880]  he was trying to make Genghis Khan, which is this amazing script that he has,
[1:21:45.880 --> 1:21:49.880]  for years, and I watched, like, them having to have meetings.
[1:21:49.880 --> 1:21:51.880]  This is a long, long time ago.
[1:21:51.880 --> 1:21:54.880]  By the way, it's now admitted that they make U.S. films removing Genghis Khan.
[1:21:54.880 --> 1:21:57.880]  Right. They have a system.
[1:21:57.880 --> 1:22:02.880]  They have rules about how you portray the Genghis Khan's story in China.
[1:22:02.880 --> 1:22:05.880]  And he was just... I remember him walking out of a meeting and just be like,
[1:22:05.880 --> 1:22:07.880]  I've never taken notes on a script.
[1:22:07.880 --> 1:22:09.880]  So that was going on how long ago?
[1:22:09.880 --> 1:22:12.880]  I mean, this had to... When I was a kid, this was a long time ago.
[1:22:12.880 --> 1:22:15.880]  China has been infiltrating Hollywood for a very long time.
[1:22:15.880 --> 1:22:16.880]  So this was 20 years ago?
[1:22:16.880 --> 1:22:19.880]  I mean, 20 years. Sure.
[1:22:19.880 --> 1:22:23.880]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was a long time ago, we don't say.
[1:22:23.880 --> 1:22:27.880]  But that's classified. But it was a long time ago.
[1:22:27.880 --> 1:22:30.880]  But no, it's a really serious problem, and now we see why.
[1:22:30.880 --> 1:22:33.880]  I mean, this moment today, the day we're in right now,
[1:22:33.880 --> 1:22:37.880]  is the reason that they have silenced so many important Americana voices,
[1:22:37.880 --> 1:22:39.880]  like yours, like, frankly, my dad...
[1:22:39.880 --> 1:22:42.880]  Well, your dad totally influenced me because...
[1:22:42.880 --> 1:22:45.880]  And you look at San Francisco, put a red diaper, doper baby,
[1:22:45.880 --> 1:22:50.880]  son of the weatherman in, and Soros, those movies were like visionary,
[1:22:50.880 --> 1:22:52.880]  where communists get put in control of cities,
[1:22:52.880 --> 1:22:55.880]  and I guess that must have already been going on.
[1:22:55.880 --> 1:22:58.880]  How did your dad come up with all that? Psychic?
[1:22:58.880 --> 1:23:02.880]  I mean, I think maybe it was being a conservative in ultra-left LA,
[1:23:02.880 --> 1:23:05.880]  and that sort of... You know, I mean, LA does actually weirdly breathe
[1:23:05.880 --> 1:23:08.880]  some really tough conservatives. You know, you've got Steve Bannon,
[1:23:08.880 --> 1:23:12.880]  who was in Brentwood, very close to my dad, Steven Miller.
[1:23:12.880 --> 1:23:16.880]  I came from there, Andrew Breitbart, was stomping around a block...
[1:23:16.880 --> 1:23:19.880]  So when you're in a stew of commies, it wakes you up?
[1:23:19.880 --> 1:23:21.880]  Yeah, and you're tough. You're used to fighting.
[1:23:21.880 --> 1:23:23.880]  Like, you're not going to back down.
[1:23:23.880 --> 1:23:25.880]  Like, when I went to go work in the Trump administration with a bunch of bureaucrats,
[1:23:25.880 --> 1:23:30.880]  you know, as one of the only politicals in an office full of 400 deep-saters,
[1:23:30.880 --> 1:23:32.880]  it doesn't scare me, it doesn't bother me,
[1:23:32.880 --> 1:23:34.880]  because I'm used to being in Los Angeles,
[1:23:34.880 --> 1:23:36.880]  and you're like, okay, well, we're just going to fight this out.
[1:23:36.880 --> 1:23:38.880]  We're going to be right back on the same enemy swamp.
[1:23:38.880 --> 1:23:41.880]  Right, exactly, except these ones are less glamorous.
[1:23:41.880 --> 1:23:43.880]  Amanda Mellius, you're on fire.
[1:23:43.880 --> 1:23:45.880]  The plot against the president is the film.
[1:23:45.880 --> 1:23:47.880]  Number one on Amazon, we'll be right back.
[1:23:47.880 --> 1:23:50.880]  And we've got Ollie Alexander leading the rebellion.
[1:23:50.880 --> 1:23:55.880]  It's all on record. Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford,
[1:23:55.880 --> 1:23:59.880]  they were all hired a year ago, and then again six months ago,
[1:23:59.880 --> 1:24:04.880]  to war game how to get the public to stay locked down during a pandemic,
[1:24:04.880 --> 1:24:06.880]  the public to take inoculations.
[1:24:06.880 --> 1:24:09.880]  And they talk about calling people heroes that do it.
[1:24:09.880 --> 1:24:11.880]  They talk about shaming those that don't.
[1:24:11.880 --> 1:24:14.880]  This has all been psychologically tested.
[1:24:14.880 --> 1:24:16.880]  They told it psychologically prepared,
[1:24:16.880 --> 1:24:18.880]  and once they get a lock down for 15 days,
[1:24:18.880 --> 1:24:20.880]  you notice now they say it's permanent.
[1:24:20.880 --> 1:24:21.880]  That's how it works.
[1:24:21.880 --> 1:24:23.880]  Oh, just put these handcuffs on.
[1:24:23.880 --> 1:24:27.880]  The serial killer says the woman in the parking lot and everything will be all right.
[1:24:27.880 --> 1:24:28.880]  No.
[1:24:28.880 --> 1:24:30.880]  Now, we've already put the handcuffs on,
[1:24:30.880 --> 1:24:32.880]  and we're in the serial killer's van.
[1:24:32.880 --> 1:24:37.880]  He's taking us to his shack in the woods to slowly torture us to death.
[1:24:37.880 --> 1:24:38.880]  That's the allegory.
[1:24:38.880 --> 1:24:40.880]  We got to bust out of this thing now.
[1:24:40.880 --> 1:24:41.880]  We got to say no now.
[1:24:41.880 --> 1:24:43.880]  We got to make a run for it now, but we still can.
[1:24:43.880 --> 1:24:45.880]  Once he gets us in that basement,
[1:24:45.880 --> 1:24:47.880]  it's going to get a lot, lot worse, folks.
[1:24:47.880 --> 1:24:48.880]  So stop submitting.
[1:24:48.880 --> 1:24:53.880]  The miraculous properties of turmeric have been admired and even worshiped
[1:24:53.880 --> 1:24:56.880]  for thousands of years by ancient civilizations.
[1:24:56.880 --> 1:24:59.880]  With modern science, we know why turmeric is so popular.
[1:24:59.880 --> 1:25:02.880]  It's antioxidant effect.
[1:25:02.880 --> 1:25:04.880]  It's anti-inflammatory effect.
[1:25:04.880 --> 1:25:06.880]  Everything it does is simply amazing.
[1:25:06.880 --> 1:25:10.880]  And most turmerics out there are simply food products.
[1:25:10.880 --> 1:25:13.880]  They're 3% to 5% curcuminoid,
[1:25:13.880 --> 1:25:20.880]  but we have body's ultimate turmeric formula with a 95% curcuminoid level.
[1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:25.880]  And we have other organic products in there that accelerate it and bring it into the cells of the body.
[1:25:25.880 --> 1:25:27.880]  It's been sold out for months.
[1:25:27.880 --> 1:25:29.880]  It's back in stock and despite that,
[1:25:29.880 --> 1:25:35.880]  body's ultimate turmeric formula at infowarstore.com is 50% off with free shipping
[1:25:35.880 --> 1:25:38.880]  and triple-patriot points at infowarstore.com.
[1:25:38.880 --> 1:25:41.880]  It's body's ultimate turmeric formula.

[1:25:46.880 --> 1:25:59.880]  and you can't lose, it funds the infowar.

[1:26:04.880 --> 1:26:07.880]  Simply go to band.video with your Safari browser.
[1:26:07.880 --> 1:26:10.880]  Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen.
[1:26:10.880 --> 1:26:14.880]  When the menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen.
[1:26:14.880 --> 1:26:16.880]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[1:26:16.880 --> 1:26:18.880]  I suggest band.video.
[1:26:18.880 --> 1:26:22.880]  You will now have band.video app on your home screen,
[1:26:22.880 --> 1:26:24.880]  despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[1:26:24.880 --> 1:26:26.880]  The globalists think you're lazy,
[1:26:26.880 --> 1:26:29.880]  but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app,
[1:26:29.880 --> 1:26:32.880]  and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[1:26:32.880 --> 1:26:35.880]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech
[1:26:35.880 --> 1:26:39.880]  and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[1:26:39.880 --> 1:26:51.880]  However you want, be sure and share band.video.
[1:26:51.880 --> 1:27:03.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:03.880 --> 1:27:10.880]  Allie Alexander is a real visionary.
[1:27:10.880 --> 1:27:13.880]  We've been tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick,
[1:27:13.880 --> 1:27:15.880]  but it's up at the top.
[1:27:15.880 --> 1:27:18.880]  All of a sudden it's free fall and I never made the point.
[1:27:18.880 --> 1:27:20.880]  And then Amanda Mellius,
[1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:22.880]  an amazing state department,
[1:27:22.880 --> 1:27:24.880]  patriot filmmaker has a new big hit,
[1:27:24.880 --> 1:27:26.880]  film out plotting as the president,
[1:27:26.880 --> 1:27:28.880]  she said, you know the allegory is a roller coaster,
[1:27:28.880 --> 1:27:30.880]  and we just went over the top.
[1:27:30.880 --> 1:27:32.880]  So you can introduce her better than I can.
[1:27:32.880 --> 1:27:33.880]  I love Allie Alexander.
[1:27:33.880 --> 1:27:35.880]  He's been on fire a long time,
[1:27:35.880 --> 1:27:38.880]  but you were talking about how he just suddenly brought all this together
[1:27:38.880 --> 1:27:40.880]  and then reached out as a catalyst.
[1:27:40.880 --> 1:27:42.880]  He months ago was saying stop is still getting it ready,
[1:27:42.880 --> 1:27:44.880]  but he is an example to others.
[1:27:44.880 --> 1:27:46.880]  He just reached out, got a bunch of key people together,
[1:27:46.880 --> 1:27:48.880]  and now this is a super viral movement.
[1:27:48.880 --> 1:27:50.880]  Well, what's crazy is from what I understand,
[1:27:50.880 --> 1:27:52.880]  and Allie can explain it the best himself,
[1:27:52.880 --> 1:27:56.880]  but we were all hanging out in Dallas doing the election event that he put together,
[1:27:56.880 --> 1:27:59.880]  and I flew out and I just heard the story from these guys,
[1:27:59.880 --> 1:28:01.880]  because we were all hanging out together the next day.
[1:28:01.880 --> 1:28:03.880]  Everybody didn't know what to do,
[1:28:03.880 --> 1:28:05.880]  and all of a sudden, all of the MAGA influencers,
[1:28:05.880 --> 1:28:07.880]  and remember, on the right,
[1:28:07.880 --> 1:28:10.880]  we all argue amongst ourselves everybody's got ego, whatever.
[1:28:10.880 --> 1:28:12.880]  All of a sudden, that disappears.
[1:28:12.880 --> 1:28:15.880]  All the disparate factions, they're all calling Allie.
[1:28:15.880 --> 1:28:17.880]  They're all calling Allie,
[1:28:17.880 --> 1:28:19.880]  and the stop the steel comes off the ground.
[1:28:19.880 --> 1:28:22.880]  So tell us about Allie. We love you, brother.
[1:28:22.880 --> 1:28:24.880]  Well, you guys too. I mean, two friends.
[1:28:24.880 --> 1:28:28.880]  It's an honor to be here for a short segment.
[1:28:28.880 --> 1:28:30.880]  Yeah, I know you've been too busy to come on.
[1:28:30.880 --> 1:28:32.880]  I'm glad you're a general up there on the front lines of the fight,
[1:28:32.880 --> 1:28:34.880]  but she said, man, you got to get Allie on.
[1:28:34.880 --> 1:28:36.880]  We called, you're able to go on now. Tell us what's happening.
[1:28:36.880 --> 1:28:38.880]  Tell us the latest, and thank God, Trump's not conceding.
[1:28:38.880 --> 1:28:41.880]  Clearly, they're catching them red-handed in fraud.
[1:28:41.880 --> 1:28:43.880]  China's involved. This is insane.
[1:28:43.880 --> 1:28:45.880]  We are catching them red-handed.
[1:28:45.880 --> 1:28:48.880]  Look, Alex, there are people organizing everywhere,
[1:28:48.880 --> 1:28:51.880]  but like Amanda said, there's an ego death going on.
[1:28:51.880 --> 1:28:55.880]  You know, I had Walk-Aways, Walk-Away, Brandon Schraka,
[1:28:55.880 --> 1:28:58.880]  contacted me, Scott Pressler contacted me.
[1:28:58.880 --> 1:29:00.880]  Mike Cernovich was in Phoenix last night.
[1:29:00.880 --> 1:29:04.880]  Jack Pasopic is in Philadelphia.
[1:29:04.880 --> 1:29:07.880]  We have activists right now in seven different states.
[1:29:07.880 --> 1:29:09.880]  Everyone's buying their own plane tickets.
[1:29:09.880 --> 1:29:11.880]  People are randomly donating.
[1:29:11.880 --> 1:29:13.880]  It's really a patriot-led effort.
[1:29:13.880 --> 1:29:15.880]  And what you're seeing from the Democrats
[1:29:15.880 --> 1:29:18.880]  is that they're closing down the counting centers.
[1:29:18.880 --> 1:29:21.880]  So in Philly, they're keeping out the Republican lawyers
[1:29:21.880 --> 1:29:25.880]  that have a court order to be in there and monitor.
[1:29:25.880 --> 1:29:28.880]  In Maricopa County, Arizona, they stopped counting
[1:29:28.880 --> 1:29:31.880]  because 200 peaceful protesters showed up
[1:29:31.880 --> 1:29:34.880]  outside the tabulation center in Fulton County
[1:29:34.880 --> 1:29:36.880]  where we only had 25 people,
[1:29:36.880 --> 1:29:38.880]  but three local news stations last night.
[1:29:38.880 --> 1:29:41.880]  Just to plan a flag, today they have closed down
[1:29:41.880 --> 1:29:43.880]  that entire parking garage where people
[1:29:43.880 --> 1:29:45.880]  were peacefully assembling.
[1:29:45.880 --> 1:29:48.880]  The Democrats are responding because they want to hide
[1:29:48.880 --> 1:29:51.880]  their ballot rigging, their ballot counting rigging
[1:29:51.880 --> 1:29:53.880]  from the people, but we're not going to let them.
[1:29:53.880 --> 1:29:55.880]  They're utterly transparent.
[1:29:55.880 --> 1:29:57.880]  They're losing. All the states they win go no problems.
[1:29:57.880 --> 1:29:59.880]  The ones they're losing, they shut down
[1:29:59.880 --> 1:30:02.880]  and they're caught shipping ballots in, in Philadelphia,
[1:30:02.880 --> 1:30:04.880]  in Detroit. I mean, they've really,
[1:30:04.880 --> 1:30:06.880]  I think they've jumped the shark.
[1:30:06.880 --> 1:30:09.880]  What are they going to do when it comes out Trump won?
[1:30:09.880 --> 1:30:11.880]  Or how do they run a scam and have, say, Nevada announce
[1:30:11.880 --> 1:30:13.880]  that Trump wins and then put him over the top?
[1:30:13.880 --> 1:30:15.880]  What are you thinking, Ollie?
[1:30:15.880 --> 1:30:18.880]  Well, look, I think that we are going to secure Arizona.
[1:30:18.880 --> 1:30:21.880]  Arizona is our path to victory.
[1:30:21.880 --> 1:30:23.880]  Unfortunately, even winning Nevada
[1:30:23.880 --> 1:30:25.880]  wouldn't put us over the top.
[1:30:25.880 --> 1:30:27.880]  That puts us at 265 or 266.
[1:30:27.880 --> 1:30:29.880]  We have to win Pennsylvania.
[1:30:29.880 --> 1:30:31.880]  And look, I know it's not popular.
[1:30:31.880 --> 1:30:33.880]  The Republican Party doesn't want me to say this,
[1:30:33.880 --> 1:30:35.880]  but we need to revote in Wisconsin
[1:30:35.880 --> 1:30:37.880]  and we need to revote in Michigan.
[1:30:37.880 --> 1:30:39.880]  The fraud is so wrought there and we are going
[1:30:39.880 --> 1:30:41.880]  to get a recount in, in Wisconsin.
[1:30:41.880 --> 1:30:43.880]  But here's what I'm afraid of, Alex.
[1:30:43.880 --> 1:30:47.880]  I think the Democrats have baited us into a rigged recount.
[1:30:47.880 --> 1:30:49.880]  So the Republicans cannot get in the mindset
[1:30:49.880 --> 1:30:51.880]  that these people have not game-theoried out
[1:30:51.880 --> 1:30:53.880]  our destruction.
[1:30:53.880 --> 1:30:55.880]  I believe that they have.
[1:30:55.880 --> 1:30:57.880]  Oh, very choreographed. I agree.
[1:30:57.880 --> 1:30:59.880]  So I think we just call for a new election.
[1:30:59.880 --> 1:31:01.880]  And then say, okay,
[1:31:01.880 --> 1:31:03.880]  but we're not going to have the COVID fake ballots
[1:31:03.880 --> 1:31:05.880]  and now we know what to look for.
[1:31:05.880 --> 1:31:07.880]  Exactly, exactly.
[1:31:07.880 --> 1:31:09.880]  I mean, the same day registration
[1:31:09.880 --> 1:31:11.880]  bump in Wisconsin
[1:31:11.880 --> 1:31:13.880]  and parts of these other states,
[1:31:13.880 --> 1:31:15.880]  it's in Nevada are 200%.
[1:31:15.880 --> 1:31:17.880]  I mean, it's insane.
[1:31:17.880 --> 1:31:19.880]  It's never happened in political history.
[1:31:19.880 --> 1:31:21.880]  They find 20,000 plus ballots.
[1:31:21.880 --> 1:31:23.880]  Everyone's for Biden. That's impossible.
[1:31:23.880 --> 1:31:25.880]  And in other countries,
[1:31:25.880 --> 1:31:27.880]  when an election is clearly fraudulent, they redo it.
[1:31:27.880 --> 1:31:29.880]  And, you know what?
[1:31:29.880 --> 1:31:31.880]  We, as the United States, usually calls them out for it.
[1:31:31.880 --> 1:31:33.880]  That's the funny thing.
[1:31:33.880 --> 1:31:35.880]  Having just spent four years in the State Department
[1:31:35.880 --> 1:31:37.880]  where one of the things we're constantly harping on
[1:31:37.880 --> 1:31:39.880]  is the free and fair elections of whatever,
[1:31:39.880 --> 1:31:41.880]  you know, Third World Hell Hall
[1:31:41.880 --> 1:31:43.880]  they're paying attention to that day.
[1:31:43.880 --> 1:31:45.880]  And then look what they're doing in our own country.
[1:31:45.880 --> 1:31:47.880]  That's, again, tying it back
[1:31:47.880 --> 1:31:49.880]  to plot against the president.
[1:31:49.880 --> 1:31:51.880]  One of the reasons I made the movie
[1:31:51.880 --> 1:31:53.880]  is because these people that want to be our overlords
[1:31:53.880 --> 1:31:55.880]  that are so obsessed with this
[1:31:55.880 --> 1:31:57.880]  disinfo and all the thought policing
[1:31:57.880 --> 1:31:59.880]  that they like to do,
[1:31:59.880 --> 1:32:01.880]  those institutions, oh, Trump's bad for our institutions,
[1:32:01.880 --> 1:32:03.880]  those institutions are bad for our institutions.
[1:32:03.880 --> 1:32:05.880]  Nobody has hurt
[1:32:05.880 --> 1:32:07.880]  our national security infrastructure
[1:32:07.880 --> 1:32:09.880]  more than our intelligence community.
[1:32:09.880 --> 1:32:11.880]  Because these are bureaucrats that sold America out.
[1:32:11.880 --> 1:32:13.880]  That's right.
[1:32:13.880 --> 1:32:15.880]  And I've seen it up close.
[1:32:15.880 --> 1:32:17.880]  And you were right about everything.
[1:32:17.880 --> 1:32:19.880]  I'm sure you're getting sick of hearing that this week,
[1:32:19.880 --> 1:32:21.880]  but I bet a lot of people are calling you
[1:32:21.880 --> 1:32:23.880]  and saying, Alex Jones, you were right about everything.
[1:32:23.880 --> 1:32:25.880]  Well, I wish I wasn't wrong about it.
[1:32:25.880 --> 1:32:27.880]  I'd love to be wrong about this.
[1:32:27.880 --> 1:32:29.880]  Because you know what's going to happen if they get in power?
[1:32:29.880 --> 1:32:31.880]  They're going to have a scorched earth policy.
[1:32:31.880 --> 1:32:33.880]  I want to be friends when I get in.
[1:32:33.880 --> 1:32:35.880]  That tells you they're coming after everybody.
[1:32:35.880 --> 1:32:37.880]  Well, thank God for patriots like Ali Alexander
[1:32:37.880 --> 1:32:39.880]  and you, everybody's been warned.
[1:32:39.880 --> 1:32:41.880]  Now we know what to do.
[1:32:41.880 --> 1:32:43.880]  I mean, like I said, it was just an amazing thing to see.
[1:32:43.880 --> 1:32:45.880]  All of these patriots, everybody turned to Ali.
[1:32:45.880 --> 1:32:47.880]  And they were like,
[1:32:47.880 --> 1:32:49.880]  Ali, the reason I got going is we know about the fraud.
[1:32:49.880 --> 1:32:51.880]  We're going to go over it with her.
[1:32:51.880 --> 1:32:53.880]  And one at a time you have, you're helping lead a movement
[1:32:53.880 --> 1:32:55.880]  to challenge this. She's about to go on a plane.
[1:32:55.880 --> 1:32:57.880]  Should she go to Nevada? Should she go to Georgia?
[1:32:57.880 --> 1:32:59.880]  Listers that want to get behind what you're doing
[1:32:59.880 --> 1:33:01.880]  and others are doing.
[1:33:01.880 --> 1:33:03.880]  Do you notice Trump's sitting back?
[1:33:03.880 --> 1:33:05.880]  I'm like, where is Trump? I think he understands.
[1:33:05.880 --> 1:33:07.880]  Let the people do it. It's up to us now.
[1:33:07.880 --> 1:33:09.880]  He's fought. I think he actually should be doing
[1:33:09.880 --> 1:33:11.880]  the White House addresses and stuff.
[1:33:11.880 --> 1:33:13.880]  But for whatever reason, he's sitting back
[1:33:13.880 --> 1:33:15.880]  making it about the people, we the people.
[1:33:15.880 --> 1:33:17.880]  So what, what are your ideas?
[1:33:17.880 --> 1:33:19.880]  What should we do?
[1:33:19.880 --> 1:33:21.880]  Well, look, we're in Arizona, Pennsylvania,
[1:33:21.880 --> 1:33:23.880]  Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia, Nevada,
[1:33:23.880 --> 1:33:25.880]  and then tomorrow we'll be in North Carolina.
[1:33:25.880 --> 1:33:27.880]  If you're in and around any of these states,
[1:33:27.880 --> 1:33:29.880]  you have to go to stopthesteel.us
[1:33:29.880 --> 1:33:31.880]  and find the address
[1:33:31.880 --> 1:33:33.880]  and show up,
[1:33:33.880 --> 1:33:35.880]  take time off of work, get a hotel,
[1:33:35.880 --> 1:33:37.880]  find a friend, text everyone.
[1:33:37.880 --> 1:33:39.880]  The thing that these bureaucrats
[1:33:39.880 --> 1:33:41.880]  hate the most, that rig elections
[1:33:41.880 --> 1:33:43.880]  is sunlight, and it will stop them in their tracks.
[1:33:43.880 --> 1:33:45.880]  We did this in Florida in 2018
[1:33:45.880 --> 1:33:47.880]  while the Republican Party lost Arizona,
[1:33:47.880 --> 1:33:49.880]  they lost Orange County,
[1:33:49.880 --> 1:33:51.880]  we almost lost Georgia due to some
[1:33:51.880 --> 1:33:53.880]  fraud there. So what we have to do
[1:33:53.880 --> 1:33:55.880]  is we have to physically show up
[1:33:55.880 --> 1:33:57.880]  or the republic's over.
[1:33:57.880 --> 1:33:59.880]  The second thing that people can do is
[1:33:59.880 --> 1:34:01.880]  that they can voice their support for President Trump.
[1:34:01.880 --> 1:34:03.880]  I think that President Trump is waiting
[1:34:03.880 --> 1:34:05.880]  to see if tens of thousands will take to the streets
[1:34:05.880 --> 1:34:07.880]  and then he can direct his DOJ
[1:34:07.880 --> 1:34:09.880]  to actually go into
[1:34:09.880 --> 1:34:11.880]  where they're counting the elections
[1:34:11.880 --> 1:34:13.880]  and monitor them.
[1:34:13.880 --> 1:34:15.880]  You said that two days ago.
[1:34:15.880 --> 1:34:17.880]  Trump is now sending in RMDHS.
[1:34:17.880 --> 1:34:19.880]  This is crime
[1:34:19.880 --> 1:34:21.880]  and the fact that Chinese communists are involved
[1:34:21.880 --> 1:34:23.880]  means it's espionage.
[1:34:23.880 --> 1:34:25.880]  Take the freaking gloves off, man.
[1:34:25.880 --> 1:34:27.880]  I'm not going to be run by the China communists.
[1:34:27.880 --> 1:34:29.880]  Take the gloves off. We know
[1:34:29.880 --> 1:34:31.880]  that that little Chinese spy center,
[1:34:31.880 --> 1:34:33.880]  that big old Chinese spy center
[1:34:33.880 --> 1:34:35.880]  in Houston, was actually
[1:34:35.880 --> 1:34:37.880]  printing fake IDs
[1:34:37.880 --> 1:34:39.880]  for people. Fake IDs
[1:34:39.880 --> 1:34:41.880]  out of Houston. So let me bring that up.
[1:34:41.880 --> 1:34:43.880]  What about the intel that somehow DHS tracks some ballots
[1:34:43.880 --> 1:34:45.880]  and that's about to come out
[1:34:45.880 --> 1:34:47.880]  and you see chai comms
[1:34:47.880 --> 1:34:49.880]  bringing ballots in in Michigan? This is ridiculous.
[1:34:49.880 --> 1:34:51.880]  It's so
[1:34:51.880 --> 1:34:53.880]  it's so systemic, Alex, that they found
[1:34:53.880 --> 1:34:55.880]  about ten different ways to cheat
[1:34:55.880 --> 1:34:57.880]  and it's all in
[1:34:57.880 --> 1:34:59.880]  Democrat governors
[1:34:59.880 --> 1:35:01.880]  or Democrat run counties. Notice that
[1:35:01.880 --> 1:35:03.880]  Republicans control more counties
[1:35:03.880 --> 1:35:05.880]  in the United States than Democrats.
[1:35:05.880 --> 1:35:07.880]  We never seem to have these problems
[1:35:07.880 --> 1:35:09.880]  in Republican counties.
[1:35:09.880 --> 1:35:11.880]  The public has to be made aware
[1:35:11.880 --> 1:35:13.880]  of the math behind- And it's because
[1:35:13.880 --> 1:35:15.880]  Christians and conservatives, we don't break the rules
[1:35:15.880 --> 1:35:17.880]  but at a certain point,
[1:35:17.880 --> 1:35:19.880]  we'll start breaking some skulls here.
[1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:21.880]  Yeah.
[1:35:21.880 --> 1:35:23.880]  Well, we certainly need to use
[1:35:23.880 --> 1:35:25.880]  the full weight of the federal government
[1:35:25.880 --> 1:35:27.880]  and what we got to do
[1:35:27.880 --> 1:35:29.880]  is we the people have to say, you have a mandate to do that.
[1:35:29.880 --> 1:35:31.880]  Trump got more votes than any candidate
[1:35:31.880 --> 1:35:33.880]  in American history.
[1:35:33.880 --> 1:35:35.880]  The idea, just visualize this.
[1:35:35.880 --> 1:35:37.880]  Go to your child and ask him,
[1:35:37.880 --> 1:35:39.880]  do you think that Joe Biden would be the
[1:35:39.880 --> 1:35:41.880]  top vote-getter in American history?
[1:35:41.880 --> 1:35:43.880]  No. Nobody believes that.
[1:35:43.880 --> 1:35:45.880]  And so we know that it's rigged.
[1:35:45.880 --> 1:35:47.880]  They just had a plus one system
[1:35:47.880 --> 1:35:49.880]  rigged in every Republican ballot that came in.
[1:35:49.880 --> 1:35:51.880]  They found a dead person.
[1:35:51.880 --> 1:35:53.880]  They found a COVID ballot.
[1:35:53.880 --> 1:35:55.880]  Somebody did a mail-in ballot and then voted in
[1:35:55.880 --> 1:35:57.880]  on election day two.
[1:35:57.880 --> 1:35:59.880]  They rigged the election. There's nobody
[1:35:59.880 --> 1:36:01.880]  who's going to believe that Joe Biden is the most popular
[1:36:01.880 --> 1:36:03.880]  politician in American history.
[1:36:03.880 --> 1:36:05.880]  I agree with you, so in closing, and join us again tonight
[1:36:05.880 --> 1:36:07.880]  whenever you are live on the street,
[1:36:07.880 --> 1:36:09.880]  we're live up at the late at night.
[1:36:09.880 --> 1:36:11.880]  What are they going to even install Biden?
[1:36:11.880 --> 1:36:13.880]  No one's going to buy it. This is any way you slice it.
[1:36:13.880 --> 1:36:15.880]  The deep state has jumped the shark.
[1:36:15.880 --> 1:36:17.880]  I think they have jumped the shark.
[1:36:17.880 --> 1:36:19.880]  And guess what? God will deliver us
[1:36:19.880 --> 1:36:21.880]  our enemies. These people full of pride
[1:36:21.880 --> 1:36:23.880]  act foolishly.
[1:36:23.880 --> 1:36:25.880]  And I got to tell you, we're optimistic
[1:36:25.880 --> 1:36:27.880]  and I'll just tell your listeners.
[1:36:27.880 --> 1:36:29.880]  Probably shouldn't say this, but I'll tell people
[1:36:29.880 --> 1:36:31.880]  we're a lot more optimistic
[1:36:31.880 --> 1:36:33.880]  than we're all letting on.
[1:36:33.880 --> 1:36:35.880]  And so there's a path to victory.
[1:36:35.880 --> 1:36:37.880]  There's probably two paths to victory.
[1:36:37.880 --> 1:36:39.880]  Maybe two and a half. We can win this
[1:36:39.880 --> 1:36:41.880]  if the people will take to the streets and show up.
[1:36:41.880 --> 1:36:43.880]  If they don't, there's no more republic.
[1:36:43.880 --> 1:36:45.880]  It's really that simple.
[1:36:45.880 --> 1:36:47.880]  It really is. At Ollie on Twitter.
[1:36:47.880 --> 1:36:49.880]  God bless you. We'll be right back with
[1:36:49.880 --> 1:36:51.880]  Amanda Lewis.
[1:36:51.880 --> 1:36:53.880]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue
[1:36:53.880 --> 1:36:55.880]  that's powerful dealing with facts
[1:36:55.880 --> 1:36:57.880]  you refuse to accept.
[1:36:57.880 --> 1:36:59.880]  If you have a family member suffering
[1:36:59.880 --> 1:37:01.880]  from this degenerative mental condition,
[1:37:01.880 --> 1:37:03.880]  buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil
[1:37:03.880 --> 1:37:05.880]  from InfowarsStore.com.
[1:37:05.880 --> 1:37:07.880]  Studies have suggested that
[1:37:07.880 --> 1:37:09.880]  fish oils and fish oil supplementation
[1:37:09.880 --> 1:37:11.880]  can slightly lower blood pressure,
[1:37:11.880 --> 1:37:13.880]  decrease triglyceride levels,
[1:37:13.880 --> 1:37:15.880]  decrease the growth rate of plaque
[1:37:15.880 --> 1:37:17.880]  and provide a soothing reduction
[1:37:17.880 --> 1:37:19.880]  in inflammatory responses
[1:37:19.880 --> 1:37:21.880]  in joints and the digestive system.
[1:37:21.880 --> 1:37:23.880]  Recent studies have suggested
[1:37:23.880 --> 1:37:25.880]  that high EPA and DHA
[1:37:25.880 --> 1:37:27.880]  fish oil can stimulate
[1:37:27.880 --> 1:37:29.880]  immune function by increasing
[1:37:29.880 --> 1:37:31.880]  the concentration and activity
[1:37:31.880 --> 1:37:33.880]  of immune cells.
[1:37:33.880 --> 1:37:35.880]  It worked for my family, and now
[1:37:35.880 --> 1:37:37.880]  I can have a logical and calm
[1:37:37.880 --> 1:37:39.880]  discussion about actual facts
[1:37:39.880 --> 1:37:41.880]  that pertain to reality.
[1:37:41.880 --> 1:37:43.880]  Get your ultimate fish oil
[1:37:43.880 --> 1:37:45.880]  for a friend, family member, or yourself
[1:37:45.880 --> 1:37:47.880]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:37:47.880 --> 1:37:49.880]  The problem with social Darwinism is
[1:37:49.880 --> 1:37:51.880]  the so-called elites,
[1:37:51.880 --> 1:37:53.880]  the most cunning, smart,
[1:37:53.880 --> 1:37:55.880]  inventive people
[1:37:55.880 --> 1:37:57.880]  believe that
[1:37:57.880 --> 1:37:59.880]  chivalry doesn't exist anymore.
[1:37:59.880 --> 1:38:01.880]  They don't believe in being aristocrats,
[1:38:01.880 --> 1:38:03.880]  trying to hold up civilization and empower the people.
[1:38:03.880 --> 1:38:05.880]  And once the establishment
[1:38:05.880 --> 1:38:07.880]  has that predatory idea, civilization
[1:38:07.880 --> 1:38:09.880]  collapses very, very quickly. You can't treat
[1:38:09.880 --> 1:38:11.880]  the least of us like garbage
[1:38:11.880 --> 1:38:13.880]  and not treat your own family like that.
[1:38:13.880 --> 1:38:15.880]  And so it is this lack of empathy
[1:38:15.880 --> 1:38:17.880]  that's going to destroy us.
[1:38:17.880 --> 1:38:19.880]  The globalists can try to be heartless devil
[1:38:19.880 --> 1:38:21.880]  worshippers that commit rituals of
[1:38:21.880 --> 1:38:23.880]  all sorts of horrible crimes,
[1:38:23.880 --> 1:38:25.880]  try to get away from humanity, but really
[1:38:25.880 --> 1:38:27.880]  they can't escape the laws of the universe.
[1:38:27.880 --> 1:38:29.880]  They may train themselves to
[1:38:29.880 --> 1:38:31.880]  commit heinous crimes and not feel it
[1:38:31.880 --> 1:38:33.880]  themselves, but the repercussions
[1:38:33.880 --> 1:38:35.880]  of what they commit always comes back
[1:38:35.880 --> 1:38:37.880]  on them and their families and the very structure
[1:38:37.880 --> 1:38:39.880]  itself. Wealth is created
[1:38:39.880 --> 1:38:41.880]  by loving God. Wealth is created
[1:38:41.880 --> 1:38:43.880]  by having a connection with God. God is
[1:38:43.880 --> 1:38:45.880]  the source of all creation, all success, all power.
[1:38:45.880 --> 1:38:47.880]  If you deny that, you'll be destroyed.
[1:38:49.880 --> 1:38:51.880]  DNA Force Plus, if you did one thing
[1:38:51.880 --> 1:38:53.880]  for your immune system, it would be
[1:38:53.880 --> 1:38:55.880]  get all the essential things. And that's the
[1:38:55.880 --> 1:38:57.880]  clean I9, X2 or X3. That's the
[1:38:57.880 --> 1:38:59.880]  bio tricillinium. That is the
[1:38:59.880 --> 1:39:01.880]  vitamin D3. That is the C. That is the zinc.
[1:39:01.880 --> 1:39:03.880]  There's 13 vitamins and minerals that are essential
[1:39:03.880 --> 1:39:05.880]  without them you die. And studies show you really need the other ones too.
[1:39:05.880 --> 1:39:07.880]  But DNA Force goes beyond that. It helps
[1:39:07.880 --> 1:39:09.880]  get all that in the cells and out the cells
[1:39:09.880 --> 1:39:11.880]  with PQQ and CoQ10 of the highest

[1:39:17.880 --> 1:39:19.880]  can get in. Viruses don't get
[1:39:19.880 --> 1:39:21.880]  in. The good stuff gets in, as the NIH
[1:39:21.880 --> 1:39:23.880]  website says, that if you have all the proper things
[1:39:23.880 --> 1:39:25.880]  they can't replicate like they could. But I do this
[1:39:25.880 --> 1:39:27.880]  because it's essential, like oxygen, like water.

[1:41:31.880 --> 1:41:33.880]  and I knew who he was and I saw
[1:41:33.880 --> 1:41:35.880]  documentary a few years before I ran into you in DC
[1:41:35.880 --> 1:41:37.880]  but you were telling us some amazing
[1:41:37.880 --> 1:41:39.880]  inside baseball again Alex Jones show
[1:41:39.880 --> 1:41:41.880]  we just tuned in
[1:41:41.880 --> 1:41:43.880]  farm powers are trying to take over

[1:41:45.880 --> 1:41:47.880]  they're getting caught everywhere
[1:41:47.880 --> 1:41:49.880]  as you said then as Trump challenges it
[1:41:49.880 --> 1:41:51.880]  they're going to claim that he's trying to steal the election
[1:41:51.880 --> 1:41:53.880]  they're going to take over
[1:41:53.880 --> 1:41:55.880]  they're going to activate their terror squads
[1:41:55.880 --> 1:41:57.880]  we'll talk about that in a moment but you were telling
[1:41:57.880 --> 1:41:59.880]  some incredible state department info
[1:41:59.880 --> 1:42:01.880]  you got appointed by
[1:42:01.880 --> 1:42:03.880]  Trump because your background
[1:42:03.880 --> 1:42:05.880]  film making and all the rest of it
[1:42:05.880 --> 1:42:07.880]  into the state department you were there
[1:42:07.880 --> 1:42:09.880]  with Obama's stay behind networks
[1:42:09.880 --> 1:42:11.880]  the headline is hero heads breaks it down
[1:42:11.880 --> 1:42:13.880]  Obama signs executive order
[1:42:13.880 --> 1:42:15.880]  creating domestic propaganda
[1:42:15.880 --> 1:42:17.880]  group
[1:42:17.880 --> 1:42:19.880]  they also described it as
[1:42:19.880 --> 1:42:21.880]  ministry of truth there's one of the headlines
[1:42:21.880 --> 1:42:23.880]  Obama quietly signs into law
[1:42:23.880 --> 1:42:25.880]  the countering disinformation propaganda act
[1:42:25.880 --> 1:42:27.880]  that's their favorite thing
[1:42:27.880 --> 1:42:29.880]  you were inside it
[1:42:29.880 --> 1:42:31.880]  tell people what you witnessed the last four years
[1:42:31.880 --> 1:42:33.880]  well it's totally Orwellian because what you have
[1:42:33.880 --> 1:42:35.880]  is every time you've got a government program
[1:42:35.880 --> 1:42:37.880]  that has anything to do with countering disinfo
[1:42:37.880 --> 1:42:39.880]  or stopping disinfo you might as well
[1:42:39.880 --> 1:42:41.880]  just change the word to promoting disinfo
[1:42:41.880 --> 1:42:43.880]  because that's what they're actually doing
[1:42:43.880 --> 1:42:45.880]  really what it is is a silencing operation
[1:42:45.880 --> 1:42:47.880]  and I can't tell you how many times I would get invited
[1:42:47.880 --> 1:42:49.880]  to these ridiculous think tanks
[1:42:49.880 --> 1:42:51.880]  or we know which God knows I'm not invited
[1:42:51.880 --> 1:42:53.880]  to anymore these crazy think tanks
[1:42:53.880 --> 1:42:55.880]  and these these you know
[1:42:55.880 --> 1:42:57.880]  Washington groups
[1:42:57.880 --> 1:42:59.880]  talking about like how do we deal with this problem
[1:42:59.880 --> 1:43:01.880]  and every single time
[1:43:01.880 --> 1:43:03.880]  you would hear how do we get people like
[1:43:03.880 --> 1:43:05.880]  Alex Jones off the air how do we silence
[1:43:05.880 --> 1:43:07.880]  how do we get how do we label
[1:43:07.880 --> 1:43:09.880]  all of these MAGA
[1:43:09.880 --> 1:43:11.880]  Twitter accounts as bots how do we can we
[1:43:11.880 --> 1:43:13.880]  automate that does anybody have an idea
[1:43:13.880 --> 1:43:15.880]  how to automate that I mean they're literally sitting there
[1:43:15.880 --> 1:43:17.880]  going back and forth figuring out how to automate
[1:43:17.880 --> 1:43:19.880]  silencing American citizens and they would bring
[1:43:19.880 --> 1:43:21.880]  people up like Jack Posovic or Mike
[1:43:21.880 --> 1:43:23.880]  and I'm sitting in the room and I'd be like
[1:43:23.880 --> 1:43:25.880]  those are my friends those aren't bots
[1:43:25.880 --> 1:43:27.880]  those are real people I've met those people
[1:43:27.880 --> 1:43:29.880]  and they and and your name came up
[1:43:29.880 --> 1:43:31.880]  infowars came up over and over again
[1:43:31.880 --> 1:43:33.880]  I mean there was an absolute
[1:43:33.880 --> 1:43:35.880]  interest in silencing that's the government
[1:43:35.880 --> 1:43:37.880]  saying they want to silence people yeah it's
[1:43:37.880 --> 1:43:39.880]  think tanks and then those people are
[1:43:39.880 --> 1:43:41.880]  they it's a revolving door with think tanks
[1:43:41.880 --> 1:43:43.880]  in the government that's the other thing that I
[1:43:43.880 --> 1:43:45.880]  mean then they have those congressional hearings
[1:43:45.880 --> 1:43:47.880]  where they say we want to silence the American people
[1:43:47.880 --> 1:43:49.880]  and the Trump that's one of his failings
[1:43:49.880 --> 1:43:51.880]  why didn't he do more to stop the censorship
[1:43:51.880 --> 1:43:53.880]  I mean because I think you if you could
[1:43:53.880 --> 1:43:55.880]  see what the kind of uphill battle
[1:43:55.880 --> 1:43:57.880]  everything he does they obstruct it was
[1:43:57.880 --> 1:43:59.880]  the you have to remember it's not just
[1:43:59.880 --> 1:44:01.880]  fighting the Democrats the Trump
[1:44:01.880 --> 1:44:03.880]  administration was an outsider to the Republican
[1:44:03.880 --> 1:44:05.880]  establishment as well so we're fighting
[1:44:05.880 --> 1:44:07.880]  everything we need a second
[1:44:07.880 --> 1:44:09.880]  term because we need our first term you know
[1:44:09.880 --> 1:44:11.880]  and that's why they're so desperate
[1:44:11.880 --> 1:44:13.880]  because what would Trump do if he got another term
[1:44:13.880 --> 1:44:15.880]  I I can imagine we would have
[1:44:15.880 --> 1:44:17.880]  the fact that we have as many wins
[1:44:17.880 --> 1:44:19.880]  as we have that there's no new wars
[1:44:19.880 --> 1:44:21.880]  the amazing things they've done on
[1:44:21.880 --> 1:44:23.880]  foreign policy the immigration sick
[1:44:23.880 --> 1:44:25.880]  we're not even talking about immigration in this
[1:44:25.880 --> 1:44:27.880]  in this election we're not even talking about it
[1:44:27.880 --> 1:44:29.880]  it's like it the winds
[1:44:29.880 --> 1:44:31.880]  that we've had against all odds
[1:44:31.880 --> 1:44:33.880]  that they've had I mean I can't I'm not in the
[1:44:33.880 --> 1:44:35.880]  administration anymore but it's
[1:44:35.880 --> 1:44:37.880]  an amazing amazing thing and I mean
[1:44:37.880 --> 1:44:39.880]  they're so afraid of what would happen in a
[1:44:39.880 --> 1:44:41.880]  second term we have to we have
[1:44:41.880 --> 1:44:43.880]  to stay strong we have to stay positive
[1:44:43.880 --> 1:44:45.880]  well that's my point is that I'm not going
[1:44:45.880 --> 1:44:47.880]  to go all Wolverine here we actually have
[1:44:47.880 --> 1:44:49.880]  the original Wolverine from Red Dawn
[1:44:49.880 --> 1:44:51.880]  that your dad produced and directed I'm
[1:44:51.880 --> 1:44:53.880]  so excited I can't believe you have this we got
[1:44:53.880 --> 1:44:55.880]  to compare
[1:44:55.880 --> 1:44:57.880]  I was given this by one of the cast but
[1:44:57.880 --> 1:44:59.880]  you know it's a lot of trouble but before
[1:44:59.880 --> 1:45:01.880]  this he was all sober Charlie Sheen
[1:45:01.880 --> 1:45:03.880]  got a letter from him in there we've got it
[1:45:03.880 --> 1:45:05.880]  hanging up on the wall there the point is just crazy
[1:45:05.880 --> 1:45:07.880]  is the word serendipity or
[1:45:07.880 --> 1:45:09.880]  synchronicity
[1:45:09.880 --> 1:45:11.880]  synchronicity yeah yeah
[1:45:11.880 --> 1:45:13.880]  it is it's total synchronicity I should have
[1:45:13.880 --> 1:45:15.880]  warned my Russian generals had except they'd
[1:45:15.880 --> 1:45:17.880]  find a photo of me in it and and I'd be
[1:45:17.880 --> 1:45:19.880]  in a I'd be in a camp by the end of the day
[1:45:19.880 --> 1:45:21.880]  but though that's it's absolute
[1:45:21.880 --> 1:45:23.880]  synchronicity and you know
[1:45:23.880 --> 1:45:25.880]  like I said I mean you inspired
[1:45:25.880 --> 1:45:27.880]  a lot of people and and I
[1:45:27.880 --> 1:45:29.880]  remember when I was volunteering in Nevada
[1:45:29.880 --> 1:45:31.880]  you'd get bus loads of
[1:45:31.880 --> 1:45:33.880]  people showing up to volunteer and they'd all be
[1:45:33.880 --> 1:45:35.880]  wearing Hillary for prison shirts they'd
[1:45:35.880 --> 1:45:37.880]  all be wearing info war shirts I mean
[1:45:37.880 --> 1:45:39.880]  that spirit needs to come back right
[1:45:39.880 --> 1:45:41.880]  now like we got to deploy out to these
[1:45:41.880 --> 1:45:43.880]  out to these states let's talk
[1:45:43.880 --> 1:45:45.880]  about
[1:45:45.880 --> 1:45:47.880]  what happens if they are able to remove Trump
[1:45:47.880 --> 1:45:49.880]  imagine the nightmare agenda the things
[1:45:49.880 --> 1:45:51.880]  they've said truth and reconciliation commissions
[1:45:53.880 --> 1:45:55.880]  they'll never let us have another election again
[1:45:55.880 --> 1:45:57.880]  that's the thing I remember sitting there in 2016
[1:45:57.880 --> 1:45:59.880]  thinking you know what if we win that means
[1:45:59.880 --> 1:46:01.880]  we really do still have elections
[1:46:01.880 --> 1:46:03.880]  in this country and I didn't know in 2016
[1:46:03.880 --> 1:46:05.880]  I was like well we either do or we don't
[1:46:05.880 --> 1:46:07.880]  I guess we'll find out and the fact that we did
[1:46:07.880 --> 1:46:09.880]  it was such an amazing affair exactly
[1:46:09.880 --> 1:46:11.880]  Trump sucker punched them because they were so arrogant
[1:46:11.880 --> 1:46:13.880]  this time they're not and they they'll bring back
[1:46:13.880 --> 1:46:15.880]  COVID to lock things down we'll be like
[1:46:15.880 --> 1:46:17.880]  Venezuela we'll never have another real election again you are damn right
[1:46:17.880 --> 1:46:19.880]  that's they're gonna arrest their opposition
[1:46:19.880 --> 1:46:21.880]  they're all over the TV saying we're gonna arrest their opposition
[1:46:21.880 --> 1:46:23.880]  and that's the point of the film that we make actually at the
[1:46:23.880 --> 1:46:25.880]  at the end we talk about how the reason
[1:46:25.880 --> 1:46:27.880]  this matters whether you like Trump you don't
[1:46:27.880 --> 1:46:29.880]  like Trump you're Republican or Democrat the
[1:46:29.880 --> 1:46:31.880]  reason that the film really matters and that that
[1:46:31.880 --> 1:46:33.880]  people understand that this lie of
[1:46:33.880 --> 1:46:35.880]  Russiagate happened I mean a lot of people are sitting there
[1:46:35.880 --> 1:46:37.880]  and they're like I've heard about Russiagate I watch
[1:46:37.880 --> 1:46:39.880]  Infowars I know what happened I'm
[1:46:39.880 --> 1:46:41.880]  pretty well read on the issue there's
[1:46:41.880 --> 1:46:43.880]  things you don't know seeing it
[1:46:43.880 --> 1:46:45.880]  on chronological order it's that same
[1:46:45.880 --> 1:46:47.880]  apparatus as the enemy it's not just the
[1:46:47.880 --> 1:46:49.880]  Russia story it's knowing about this
[1:46:49.880 --> 1:46:51.880]  dug in entitled bureaucrats yes that
[1:46:51.880 --> 1:46:53.880]  Trump talks about the middlemen
[1:46:53.880 --> 1:46:55.880]  Trump's like well China's not even that bad
[1:46:55.880 --> 1:46:57.880]  he learned that on the drug deals it's
[1:46:57.880 --> 1:46:59.880]  middlemen making most the money ripping us
[1:46:59.880 --> 1:47:01.880]  off and it's our intel community
[1:47:01.880 --> 1:47:03.880]  communities it's the the intel community
[1:47:03.880 --> 1:47:05.880]  and the overreaching FBI I mean look at what
[1:47:05.880 --> 1:47:07.880]  happened to Roger Stone I mean we go through
[1:47:07.880 --> 1:47:09.880]  all of the abuses that happened in this
[1:47:09.880 --> 1:47:11.880]  film and like I said that the main point
[1:47:11.880 --> 1:47:13.880]  is that that's not American whatever
[1:47:13.880 --> 1:47:15.880]  you think about the president that's
[1:47:15.880 --> 1:47:17.880]  not American that's how third world countries
[1:47:17.880 --> 1:47:19.880]  deal with their problems is they
[1:47:19.880 --> 1:47:21.880]  they arrest their enemies they spy
[1:47:21.880 --> 1:47:23.880]  on their political enemies their political
[1:47:23.880 --> 1:47:25.880]  opposition that is not what we do in the
[1:47:25.880 --> 1:47:27.880]  United States what they've done to general
[1:47:27.880 --> 1:47:29.880]  win is something out of a third
[1:47:29.880 --> 1:47:31.880]  world country it's a show
[1:47:31.880 --> 1:47:33.880]  and people you understand that the good news
[1:47:33.880 --> 1:47:35.880]  is we've drawn out the deep state now
[1:47:35.880 --> 1:47:37.880]  that they're totally unveiled yes so
[1:47:37.880 --> 1:47:39.880]  what are they going to do now
[1:47:39.880 --> 1:47:41.880]  in any way you slice it I was a sick
[1:47:41.880 --> 1:47:43.880]  Machiavellian thinker I don't follow
[1:47:43.880 --> 1:47:45.880]  Machiavellian views but I can do it
[1:47:45.880 --> 1:47:47.880]  them stealing it from Trump and doing
[1:47:47.880 --> 1:47:49.880]  all this will actually hurt them more I
[1:47:49.880 --> 1:47:51.880]  think in the future but they just can't
[1:47:51.880 --> 1:47:53.880]  help themselves well that's what this is
[1:47:53.880 --> 1:47:55.880]  this is an info war what we are in today
[1:47:55.880 --> 1:47:57.880]  is this whole election and the way
[1:47:57.880 --> 1:47:59.880]  that they are that the way that Fox News
[1:47:59.880 --> 1:48:01.880]  called Arizona and then any state
[1:48:01.880 --> 1:48:03.880]  that Trump is obviously going to get
[1:48:03.880 --> 1:48:05.880]  they just delay and delay and delay
[1:48:05.880 --> 1:48:07.880]  that's an info war that's an information
[1:48:07.880 --> 1:48:09.880]  operation that's meant to make both
[1:48:09.880 --> 1:48:11.880]  sides feel something very specific
[1:48:11.880 --> 1:48:13.880]  they're very good at this I got to say
[1:48:13.880 --> 1:48:15.880]  the deep state whatever you want to call
[1:48:15.880 --> 1:48:17.880]  it the whole thing with covid the whole
[1:48:17.880 --> 1:48:19.880]  Russia gate hoax all
[1:48:19.880 --> 1:48:21.880]  of it is very very well done
[1:48:21.880 --> 1:48:23.880]  it's it is done to make people
[1:48:23.880 --> 1:48:25.880]  not pay attention and to have the feelings
[1:48:25.880 --> 1:48:27.880]  that they want they put us into martial
[1:48:27.880 --> 1:48:29.880]  law on on a hoax
[1:48:29.880 --> 1:48:31.880]  when there's a real virus not as bad as the flu
[1:48:31.880 --> 1:48:33.880]  and they all the fake numbers everything
[1:48:33.880 --> 1:48:35.880]  I mean they they showed us
[1:48:35.880 --> 1:48:37.880]  what what else might they try if Trump
[1:48:37.880 --> 1:48:39.880]  beats this fraud I'm kind of concerned
[1:48:39.880 --> 1:48:41.880]  like they're gonna up the ante they're
[1:48:41.880 --> 1:48:43.880]  gonna up the any and we're in it right now they're gonna try
[1:48:43.880 --> 1:48:45.880]  and say that he's the one that was stealing the election
[1:48:45.880 --> 1:48:47.880]  when it was really them one thing
[1:48:47.880 --> 1:48:49.880]  that they're gonna do that I mean to tell everybody
[1:48:49.880 --> 1:48:51.880]  which I was speaking about a little bit which is
[1:48:51.880 --> 1:48:53.880]  everybody needs to find alternate methods
[1:48:53.880 --> 1:48:55.880]  to get your information make
[1:48:55.880 --> 1:48:57.880]  sure that you're signed up for email lists like
[1:48:57.880 --> 1:48:59.880]  info wars and also
[1:48:59.880 --> 1:49:01.880]  with your friends make group chats on signal
[1:49:01.880 --> 1:49:03.880]  because I'm trying we gotta migrate
[1:49:03.880 --> 1:49:05.880]  over to a backup because there
[1:49:05.880 --> 1:49:07.880]  we're already in the
[1:49:07.880 --> 1:49:09.880]  total lockdown everybody's being blocked
[1:49:09.880 --> 1:49:11.880]  everybody's been censored wait till the next few
[1:49:11.880 --> 1:49:13.880]  days we don't they could literally kick
[1:49:13.880 --> 1:49:15.880]  as we've seen they could kick all of the patriots
[1:49:15.880 --> 1:49:17.880]  off Twitter and off of all of the
[1:49:17.880 --> 1:49:19.880]  platforms and we'd have no way of communicating
[1:49:19.880 --> 1:49:21.880]  people need to get ready now they need to
[1:49:21.880 --> 1:49:23.880]  I mean you know who said it as well which is crazy
[1:49:23.880 --> 1:49:25.880]  because of what happened I don't know what happened
[1:49:25.880 --> 1:49:27.880]  to him this year but that amazing episode you had with Matt
[1:49:27.880 --> 1:49:29.880]  Drudge where he said do not get locked in their internet
[1:49:29.880 --> 1:49:31.880]  ghettos that was very that was
[1:49:31.880 --> 1:49:33.880]  very present what happened to Drudge I
[1:49:33.880 --> 1:49:35.880]  you tell me you know I everybody thinks
[1:49:35.880 --> 1:49:37.880]  he was kidnapped and there's somebody else in place
[1:49:37.880 --> 1:49:39.880]  because this is very bizarre his behavior this
[1:49:39.880 --> 1:49:41.880]  year it's very weird is not
[1:49:41.880 --> 1:49:43.880]  helpful is what it is but whatever
[1:49:43.880 --> 1:49:45.880]  his game is I'm not super into it but
[1:49:45.880 --> 1:49:47.880]  but anyway but yet I'm not into it either
[1:49:47.880 --> 1:49:49.880]  I mean was he blackmailed was he
[1:49:49.880 --> 1:49:51.880]  kidnapped I mean they're willing to do anything
[1:49:51.880 --> 1:49:53.880]  no I think
[1:49:53.880 --> 1:49:55.880]  he was at the White House some they didn't
[1:49:55.880 --> 1:49:57.880]  listen to him he saw some of the trails he got
[1:49:57.880 --> 1:49:59.880]  really pissed they weren't standing up against
[1:49:59.880 --> 1:50:01.880]  censorship and
[1:50:01.880 --> 1:50:03.880]  Steve Bannon
[1:50:03.880 --> 1:50:05.880]  through the grapevine told me that
[1:50:05.880 --> 1:50:07.880]  CNN
[1:50:07.880 --> 1:50:09.880]  leased it and that CNN that's what it seems like
[1:50:09.880 --> 1:50:11.880]  that's totally what it seems like
[1:50:11.880 --> 1:50:13.880]  but then I'm like okay I don't
[1:50:13.880 --> 1:50:15.880]  believe Steve Bannon because what Roger Stone said
[1:50:15.880 --> 1:50:17.880]  I'm gonna get the middle of it I think Steve
[1:50:17.880 --> 1:50:19.880]  overall is a good guy I don't want to be mad at him
[1:50:19.880 --> 1:50:21.880]  I don't want to have fights with people I'm not trying to be a Washington
[1:50:21.880 --> 1:50:23.880]  I don't care I don't get the middle of it but then
[1:50:23.880 --> 1:50:25.880]  I look at CNN and then I look
[1:50:25.880 --> 1:50:27.880]  at Drudge and it's
[1:50:27.880 --> 1:50:29.880]  it's their flavor it's their signature it is
[1:50:29.880 --> 1:50:31.880]  it is CNN it matches
[1:50:31.880 --> 1:50:33.880]  very very well Drudge reports now CNN
[1:50:33.880 --> 1:50:35.880]  but however what he said on your show and I
[1:50:35.880 --> 1:50:37.880]  remember listening to that it was a huge deal that show
[1:50:37.880 --> 1:50:39.880]  I mean listen I owe a lot
[1:50:39.880 --> 1:50:41.880]  of our you know Drudge
[1:50:41.880 --> 1:50:43.880]  put us over the top he saved us in so many ways
[1:50:43.880 --> 1:50:45.880]  it's like I love Drudge I really admire
[1:50:45.880 --> 1:50:47.880]  him he's a great guy and then I don't
[1:50:47.880 --> 1:50:49.880]  know it's I have a real I'm a super loyal
[1:50:49.880 --> 1:50:51.880]  person and then but I'm also loyal
[1:50:51.880 --> 1:50:53.880]  to my family and the chai-com
[1:50:53.880 --> 1:50:55.880]  element coming into this now
[1:50:55.880 --> 1:50:57.880]  I just it's all bets are off
[1:50:57.880 --> 1:50:59.880]  but yeah people need to get ready and
[1:50:59.880 --> 1:51:01.880]  to to to be prepared
[1:51:01.880 --> 1:51:03.880]  for people to be kicked off follow people on
[1:51:03.880 --> 1:51:05.880]  their own websites don't don't be
[1:51:05.880 --> 1:51:07.880]  prepared to just watch everybody on your favorite
[1:51:07.880 --> 1:51:09.880]  social media platform
[1:51:09.880 --> 1:51:11.880]  I also got to tell people you got to
[1:51:11.880 --> 1:51:13.880]  watch this movie you think you know rush
[1:51:13.880 --> 1:51:15.880]  again you think you know what happened
[1:51:15.880 --> 1:51:17.880]  going into what we're about to go into right now
[1:51:17.880 --> 1:51:19.880]  the end of this election
[1:51:19.880 --> 1:51:21.880]  you got to be prepared for what they're going to do
[1:51:21.880 --> 1:51:23.880]  prepare yourself because they're using information
[1:51:23.880 --> 1:51:25.880]  warfare systems it's information
[1:51:25.880 --> 1:51:27.880]  never got rid of the stay behind networks he tried
[1:51:27.880 --> 1:51:29.880]  to you can you got to change the law
[1:51:29.880 --> 1:51:31.880]  I mean the the we're we're
[1:51:31.880 --> 1:51:33.880]  let's talk about that yeah
[1:51:33.880 --> 1:51:35.880]  Amanda Milius is our guest on Alex Jones
[1:51:37.880 --> 1:51:39.880]  the control corporate media
[1:51:39.880 --> 1:51:41.880]  are mouthpieces for any big corporation
[1:51:41.880 --> 1:51:43.880]  or government that'll pay them
[1:51:43.880 --> 1:51:45.880]  it's that simple they've used our open free
[1:51:45.880 --> 1:51:47.880]  society against us
[1:51:47.880 --> 1:51:49.880]  the control media will talk about a few
[1:51:49.880 --> 1:51:51.880]  mistakes I've made over the years and obsess over
[1:51:51.880 --> 1:51:53.880]  and say see he's a liar on purpose
[1:51:53.880 --> 1:51:55.880]  even though our success rate our accuracy
[1:51:55.880 --> 1:51:57.880]  rate is way way better than theirs
[1:51:57.880 --> 1:51:59.880]  we try to tell the truth
[1:51:59.880 --> 1:52:01.880]  they try to lie they try to deceive
[1:52:01.880 --> 1:52:03.880]  I'm trying to get people to realize
[1:52:03.880 --> 1:52:05.880]  that the globalist operate how they manipulate
[1:52:05.880 --> 1:52:07.880]  how they
[1:52:07.880 --> 1:52:09.880]  they have booze with the public I'm trying to
[1:52:09.880 --> 1:52:11.880]  get the public to ask the questions
[1:52:11.880 --> 1:52:13.880]  and do not believe what they're told in the face
[1:52:13.880 --> 1:52:15.880]  I'm trying to get people
[1:52:15.880 --> 1:52:17.880]  to research for themselves
[1:52:17.880 --> 1:52:19.880]  the globalist and their control
[1:52:19.880 --> 1:52:21.880]  corporate press say that researching
[1:52:21.880 --> 1:52:23.880]  and not trusting media is
[1:52:23.880 --> 1:52:25.880]  evil and is a conspiracy theory
[1:52:25.880 --> 1:52:27.880]  but again on its face that is a fraud
[1:52:27.880 --> 1:52:29.880]  question everything
[1:52:29.880 --> 1:52:31.880]  question info wars add your own
[1:52:31.880 --> 1:52:33.880]  research to it and then decide what you're going to
[1:52:33.880 --> 1:52:35.880]  promote to others and what new sources are
[1:52:35.880 --> 1:52:37.880]  factoring I believe it for the best source
[1:52:37.880 --> 1:52:39.880]  out there
[1:52:39.880 --> 1:52:41.880]  I once saw a bumper sticker
[1:52:41.880 --> 1:52:43.880]  that read if you want your children
[1:52:43.880 --> 1:52:45.880]  to listen to you whisper
[1:52:45.880 --> 1:52:47.880]  and it's true a lot of
[1:52:47.880 --> 1:52:49.880]  times if somebody's shouting and yelling
[1:52:49.880 --> 1:52:51.880]  even if what they're
[1:52:51.880 --> 1:52:53.880]  talking about is important people tend to tune it
[1:52:53.880 --> 1:52:55.880]  out you know why I know that
[1:52:55.880 --> 1:52:57.880]  because I'm Alex Jones
[1:52:57.880 --> 1:52:59.880]  and I've been pretty obnoxious over the years
[1:52:59.880 --> 1:53:01.880]  because I'm worried about
[1:53:01.880 --> 1:53:03.880]  the new world order and I read about all
[1:53:03.880 --> 1:53:05.880]  their plans to lock down civilization
[1:53:05.880 --> 1:53:07.880]  start the third world and then
[1:53:07.880 --> 1:53:09.880]  enslave the first world
[1:53:09.880 --> 1:53:11.880]  so I've been really really loud and really
[1:53:11.880 --> 1:53:13.880]  really aggressive and we've had a big
[1:53:13.880 --> 1:53:15.880]  effect but but now it's time to think
[1:53:15.880 --> 1:53:17.880]  about every different angle
[1:53:17.880 --> 1:53:19.880]  and every different way we can get people
[1:53:19.880 --> 1:53:21.880]  to think for themselves before
[1:53:21.880 --> 1:53:23.880]  it's too late the lockdown
[1:53:23.880 --> 1:53:25.880]  social distancing the mask
[1:53:25.880 --> 1:53:27.880]  is meant to end human civilization
[1:53:27.880 --> 1:53:29.880]  we are under a civilization
[1:53:29.880 --> 1:53:31.880]  collapse weapon
[1:53:31.880 --> 1:53:33.880]  so this is live and death
[1:53:33.880 --> 1:53:35.880]  please share info wars dot com

[1:53:37.880 --> 1:53:39.880]  election coverage

[1:53:43.880 --> 1:54:09.880]  Alex Jones show
[1:54:09.880 --> 1:54:13.880]  yes she's an amazing lady
[1:54:13.880 --> 1:54:15.880]  I've seen it and you know all this stuff
[1:54:15.880 --> 1:54:17.880]  but you don't you should share the film
[1:54:17.880 --> 1:54:19.880]  with others that are not aware
[1:54:19.880 --> 1:54:21.880]  plot against the president patpmovie.com
[1:54:21.880 --> 1:54:23.880]  this is a short segment long segment
[1:54:23.880 --> 1:54:25.880]  coming out I'm glad you came into Austin

[1:54:27.880 --> 1:54:29.880]  these battles on the ground
[1:54:29.880 --> 1:54:31.880]  this is just it shows
[1:54:31.880 --> 1:54:33.880]  the arrogance of these people that they're actually
[1:54:33.880 --> 1:54:35.880]  trying to to to
[1:54:35.880 --> 1:54:37.880]  execute this and do this
[1:54:37.880 --> 1:54:39.880]  what do you think is going to happen
[1:54:39.880 --> 1:54:41.880]  if they are able to fraudulently remove trump
[1:54:41.880 --> 1:54:43.880]  what are they going to go for
[1:54:43.880 --> 1:54:45.880]  I've been saying to my friends I just hope
[1:54:45.880 --> 1:54:47.880]  we all go to the same reeducation camp
[1:54:47.880 --> 1:54:49.880]  so that I can hang out with them
[1:54:49.880 --> 1:54:51.880]  I don't want to be by myself but no
[1:54:51.880 --> 1:54:53.880]  I mean we make jokes but it's
[1:54:53.880 --> 1:54:55.880]  they were trying to do it while trump was in
[1:54:55.880 --> 1:54:57.880]  office they're talking to hillary said
[1:54:57.880 --> 1:54:59.880]  we need camps for men and now they're saying
[1:54:59.880 --> 1:55:01.880]  we need prison reconciliation
[1:55:01.880 --> 1:55:03.880]  that's a camp I mean we're not going to
[1:55:03.880 --> 1:55:05.880]  the free speech that's out the door
[1:55:05.880 --> 1:55:07.880]  with that goes the whole country
[1:55:07.880 --> 1:55:09.880]  and for example I mean we just found out
[1:55:09.880 --> 1:55:11.880]  right now as we were talking about
[1:55:11.880 --> 1:55:13.880]  the stop the steal movement that's been
[1:55:13.880 --> 1:55:15.880]  taking off in the last two days from Ali
[1:55:15.880 --> 1:55:17.880]  that 350,000 people
[1:55:17.880 --> 1:55:19.880]  overnight had signed up
[1:55:19.880 --> 1:55:21.880]  for their Facebook group and just
[1:55:21.880 --> 1:55:23.880]  now Facebook has deleted it
[1:55:23.880 --> 1:55:25.880]  which is insane
[1:55:25.880 --> 1:55:27.880]  that is huge news so stop the steal
[1:55:27.880 --> 1:55:29.880]  gets organized for citizens to protest
[1:55:29.880 --> 1:55:31.880]  and say we believe there's election
[1:55:31.880 --> 1:55:33.880]  fraud there's overwhelming evidence they'll let the left
[1:55:33.880 --> 1:55:35.880]  organize on there but they will not let
[1:55:35.880 --> 1:55:37.880]  conservatives that's election meddling
[1:55:37.880 --> 1:55:39.880]  yeah it's absolutely and that they do this on everything
[1:55:39.880 --> 1:55:41.880]  and we're so used to it like when we
[1:55:41.880 --> 1:55:43.880]  put the movie out Amazon held it for 12
[1:55:43.880 --> 1:55:45.880]  days for what they called an extended
[1:55:45.880 --> 1:55:47.880]  content review they didn't release the movie
[1:55:47.880 --> 1:55:49.880]  on Amazon until Hollywood Reporter
[1:55:49.880 --> 1:55:51.880]  wrote a story about them blocking
[1:55:51.880 --> 1:55:53.880]  us and then magically that day it goes
[1:55:53.880 --> 1:55:55.880]  out and it becomes in
[1:55:55.880 --> 1:55:57.880]  three days it became the number one documentary on
[1:55:57.880 --> 1:55:59.880]  Amazon but see that's their ignorance
[1:55:59.880 --> 1:56:01.880]  it's not that I'm that good on air they try
[1:56:01.880 --> 1:56:03.880]  to censor me so when I go on Joe Rogan it's
[1:56:03.880 --> 1:56:05.880]  the biggest podcast you've ever done
[1:56:05.880 --> 1:56:07.880]  so they don't get the Streisand effect
[1:56:07.880 --> 1:56:09.880]  but they do they believe they have a
[1:56:09.880 --> 1:56:11.880]  singularity of censorship and finally
[1:56:11.880 --> 1:56:13.880]  shut everything down with their AI
[1:56:13.880 --> 1:56:15.880]  that finally it's gonna work that's the problem
[1:56:15.880 --> 1:56:17.880]  that's what's gonna happen is it'll finally
[1:56:17.880 --> 1:56:19.880]  work right now it's human based
[1:56:19.880 --> 1:56:21.880]  so we're all all of the people
[1:56:21.880 --> 1:56:23.880]  the patriots that are interested in seeing the
[1:56:23.880 --> 1:56:25.880]  movie watching your show doing
[1:56:25.880 --> 1:56:27.880]  you know naturally finding
[1:56:27.880 --> 1:56:29.880]  the truth because it's like water you know
[1:56:29.880 --> 1:56:31.880]  the truth comes out
[1:56:31.880 --> 1:56:33.880]  once it's all machine driven we're gonna
[1:56:33.880 --> 1:56:35.880]  be we're gonna be in trouble and that's why
[1:56:35.880 --> 1:56:37.880]  we've got to keep jumping in front of live news
[1:56:37.880 --> 1:56:39.880]  cameras that queue up that fella
[1:56:39.880 --> 1:56:41.880]  we played yesterday go ask do he has a clip we'll play
[1:56:41.880 --> 1:56:43.880]  it next segment where he's the same guy that
[1:56:43.880 --> 1:56:45.880]  said Bill Clinton's a rapist and triggered it all over
[1:56:45.880 --> 1:56:47.880]  the country one of our listeners forget his name
[1:56:47.880 --> 1:56:49.880]  I've had it here last night he just jumps up
[1:56:49.880 --> 1:56:51.880]  in Phoenix on the TV and says it's a
[1:56:51.880 --> 1:56:53.880]  fraud it's a scam and now that's
[1:56:53.880 --> 1:56:55.880]  chain reactioning they
[1:56:55.880 --> 1:56:57.880]  they want to keep us online
[1:56:57.880 --> 1:56:59.880]  so we don't think about third dimension but if we just hit
[1:56:59.880 --> 1:57:01.880]  the third dimension and then take over
[1:57:01.880 --> 1:57:03.880]  their feeds we can stop them that's why it's
[1:57:03.880 --> 1:57:05.880]  so important to meet up with these groups because
[1:57:05.880 --> 1:57:07.880]  you know what it's taking it out of the online
[1:57:07.880 --> 1:57:09.880]  sphere and into in person and that is
[1:57:09.880 --> 1:57:11.880]  that is part of what they're afraid of because
[1:57:11.880 --> 1:57:13.880]  we can see the numbers you can see people
[1:57:13.880 --> 1:57:15.880]  it ruins and he was supposed to be the
[1:57:15.880 --> 1:57:17.880]  intimidation will shoot you will stab you
[1:57:17.880 --> 1:57:19.880]  right but it's not intimidating it's like when
[1:57:19.880 --> 1:57:21.880]  Hitler was bombing London
[1:57:21.880 --> 1:57:23.880]  most Brits were against the war because they
[1:57:23.880 --> 1:57:25.880]  had World War one but once the Hitler bombed them
[1:57:25.880 --> 1:57:27.880]  over 95% said let's go to war right
[1:57:27.880 --> 1:57:29.880]  they want to fight you Hitler thought
[1:57:29.880 --> 1:57:31.880]  I bombed you you're gonna roll over what was he thinking
[1:57:31.880 --> 1:57:33.880]  well it's it is similar to that because you know
[1:57:33.880 --> 1:57:35.880]  it's pissing off normal people where you
[1:57:35.880 --> 1:57:37.880]  can't take your family and go out to eat
[1:57:37.880 --> 1:57:39.880]  in Washington DC
[1:57:39.880 --> 1:57:41.880]  in a lot of these liberal cities
[1:57:41.880 --> 1:57:43.880]  because you're gonna get attacked by some
[1:57:43.880 --> 1:57:45.880]  crowd of people walking by sitting at your
[1:57:45.880 --> 1:57:47.880]  table and throwing throwing your drink
[1:57:47.880 --> 1:57:49.880]  on you because because they're you know BLM
[1:57:49.880 --> 1:57:51.880]  is coming through I mean that's not getting
[1:57:51.880 --> 1:57:53.880]  anybody that's not getting any hard
[1:57:53.880 --> 1:57:55.880]  to randomly attack people in fact put that
[1:57:55.880 --> 1:57:57.880]  banner back up Antifa says they want
[1:57:57.880 --> 1:57:59.880]  revenge for imperialist
[1:57:59.880 --> 1:58:01.880]  wars Trump's ending that's
[1:58:01.880 --> 1:58:03.880]  oh that drives me so nuts when you
[1:58:03.880 --> 1:58:05.880]  talk to the you're like what happened
[1:58:05.880 --> 1:58:07.880]  to the anti-war faction of
[1:58:07.880 --> 1:58:09.880]  the left all of a sudden they're totally
[1:58:09.880 --> 1:58:11.880]  pro Hillary Clinton and
[1:58:11.880 --> 1:58:13.880]  the Biden's Obama had the exact same foreign
[1:58:13.880 --> 1:58:15.880]  policy by the way as the Bush is
[1:58:15.880 --> 1:58:17.880]  that's the thing that and we we on
[1:58:17.880 --> 1:58:19.880]  our side we need to do better at explaining
[1:58:19.880 --> 1:58:21.880]  that because that anti that
[1:58:21.880 --> 1:58:23.880]  the fact that we haven't started any new wars and the president is
[1:58:23.880 --> 1:58:25.880]  against extending these forever
[1:58:25.880 --> 1:58:27.880]  wars that's why they're really at him because
[1:58:27.880 --> 1:58:29.880]  that's what's funding the machine I know your
[1:58:29.880 --> 1:58:31.880]  listeners know that but it's so true
[1:58:31.880 --> 1:58:33.880]  that's what's funding their whole
[1:58:33.880 --> 1:58:35.880]  listeners know it but they need to tell other people
[1:58:35.880 --> 1:58:37.880]  I'm not bitching at the listeners I'm bitching at myself
[1:58:37.880 --> 1:58:39.880]  we all need to have maximum effort right now
[1:58:39.880 --> 1:58:41.880]  get past the normalcy bias
[1:58:41.880 --> 1:58:43.880]  we are not in a normal position we are in
[1:58:43.880 --> 1:58:45.880]  the attempt at overthrow of our country
[1:58:47.880 --> 1:58:49.880]  there are many references in the holy
[1:58:49.880 --> 1:58:51.880]  Bible to the mustard seed
[1:58:51.880 --> 1:58:53.880]  and why is that it's one of the
[1:58:53.880 --> 1:58:55.880]  tiniest seeds out there but a giant
[1:58:55.880 --> 1:58:57.880]  tree like bush grows from it
[1:58:57.880 --> 1:58:59.880]  that produces more mustard
[1:58:59.880 --> 1:59:01.880]  seeds mustard was
[1:59:01.880 --> 1:59:03.880]  known by the ancients around the world
[1:59:03.880 --> 1:59:05.880]  to have amazing health effects they didn't
[1:59:05.880 --> 1:59:07.880]  know why well with modern science
[1:59:07.880 --> 1:59:09.880]  we know it's one of the purest cleanest
[1:59:09.880 --> 1:59:11.880]  organic forms of

[2:00:17.880 --> 2:00:19.880]  in DC huge fan of her dad
[2:00:19.880 --> 2:00:21.880]  John Milius 30 Harry
[2:00:21.880 --> 2:00:23.880]  Conan the Barbarian
[2:00:23.880 --> 2:00:25.880]  red dawn red dawn I mean the list goes
[2:00:25.880 --> 2:00:27.880]  on and on another great patriot
[2:00:27.880 --> 2:00:29.880]  when the only conservatives in Hollywood
[2:00:29.880 --> 2:00:31.880]  probably the most effective and prominent
[2:00:31.880 --> 2:00:33.880]  the others just kind of like halfway are
[2:00:33.880 --> 2:00:35.880]  he was very strong very intense
[2:00:35.880 --> 2:00:37.880]  and the left tried to censor
[2:00:37.880 --> 2:00:39.880]  his original Conan the Barbarian
[2:00:39.880 --> 2:00:41.880]  that's right and he had they had to create
[2:00:41.880 --> 2:00:43.880]  a new rating for red dawn they've created
[2:00:43.880 --> 2:00:45.880]  the PG 13 rating for it because
[2:00:45.880 --> 2:00:47.880]  they said it was so violent and now you
[2:00:47.880 --> 2:00:49.880]  watch it and it's like it's not even
[2:00:49.880 --> 2:00:51.880]  it's like for kids it's not even it's not even
[2:00:51.880 --> 2:00:53.880]  that violent but yeah I know they've
[2:00:53.880 --> 2:00:55.880]  he's he you know I mean he used to bring
[2:00:55.880 --> 2:00:57.880]  a gun to meetings with these
[2:00:57.880 --> 2:00:59.880]  freaked out leftist executives
[2:00:59.880 --> 2:01:01.880]  and they tried to
[2:01:01.880 --> 2:01:03.880]  mess around with this films and he would just put it
[2:01:03.880 --> 2:01:05.880]  on the table he wouldn't do anything with it but he
[2:01:05.880 --> 2:01:07.880]  would just put it on the table and he was like
[2:01:07.880 --> 2:01:09.880]  okay what are the notes you have on the script
[2:01:09.880 --> 2:01:11.880]  I mean who does that you get
[2:01:11.880 --> 2:01:13.880]  your dad sounds like a fun guy to hang out with
[2:01:13.880 --> 2:01:15.880]  yeah you guys would be outrageous together
[2:01:15.880 --> 2:01:17.880]  and I guess your dad's quite the ladies man too
[2:01:17.880 --> 2:01:19.880]  I mean I suppose
[2:01:19.880 --> 2:01:21.880]  this is something we've been
[2:01:21.880 --> 2:01:23.880]  yeah he's uh
[2:01:23.880 --> 2:01:25.880]  I mean he's like you know there's not that many masculine guys
[2:01:25.880 --> 2:01:27.880]  in the 70s 80s yeah he's so alpha
[2:01:27.880 --> 2:01:29.880]  that that's I was making a joke with Gavin
[2:01:29.880 --> 2:01:31.880]  McGinnis Gavin McGinnis had me on and he said
[2:01:31.880 --> 2:01:33.880]  the nicest thing I've ever heard anyone's ever said to me
[2:01:33.880 --> 2:01:35.880]  which is that he couldn't believe
[2:01:35.880 --> 2:01:37.880]  that my movie was made by a girl
[2:01:37.880 --> 2:01:39.880]  and I was like that's the best thing I've ever heard
[2:01:39.880 --> 2:01:41.880]  and I was like no it's just because my dad
[2:01:41.880 --> 2:01:43.880]  is so alpha that even his daughter can make good movies
[2:01:43.880 --> 2:01:45.880]  well let's talk about that you got
[2:01:45.880 --> 2:01:47.880]  all the top people in your film
[2:01:47.880 --> 2:01:49.880]  tell me about that
[2:01:49.880 --> 2:01:51.880]  well it's focused on the people
[2:01:51.880 --> 2:01:53.880]  who discovered the actual
[2:01:53.880 --> 2:01:55.880]  lie of Russia gate which is Devin Nunes
[2:01:55.880 --> 2:01:57.880]  and his team
[2:01:57.880 --> 2:01:59.880]  a very important guy named Cash Patel
[2:01:59.880 --> 2:02:01.880]  Jack Langer
[2:02:01.880 --> 2:02:03.880]  and then we also have Rick Grinnell
[2:02:03.880 --> 2:02:05.880]  Don Jr. Kimberly Gilfoyle
[2:02:05.880 --> 2:02:07.880]  Jim Jordan Matt Gaetz
[2:02:07.880 --> 2:02:09.880]  Seb Gorka
[2:02:09.880 --> 2:02:11.880]  Mike Sernovich
[2:02:11.880 --> 2:02:13.880]  Jack Pasovic
[2:02:13.880 --> 2:02:15.880]  John Solomon all of the people who were right
[2:02:15.880 --> 2:02:17.880]  a lot of folks asked me they're like oh well it seems
[2:02:17.880 --> 2:02:19.880]  like it's got some really high up government folks in it
[2:02:19.880 --> 2:02:21.880]  why do you have so many
[2:02:21.880 --> 2:02:23.880]  like of the MAGA influencers
[2:02:23.880 --> 2:02:25.880]  like the Pasovics and the Sernovich's
[2:02:25.880 --> 2:02:27.880]  who make the movie I mean they're fantastic
[2:02:27.880 --> 2:02:29.880]  and it's because they were right
[2:02:29.880 --> 2:02:31.880]  and if it wasn't for them and people like you
[2:02:31.880 --> 2:02:33.880]  we wouldn't know that the Russia gate
[2:02:33.880 --> 2:02:35.880]  story was a hoax because the mainstream
[2:02:35.880 --> 2:02:37.880]  media was complicit in that
[2:02:37.880 --> 2:02:39.880]  they wouldn't have been able to pull off Russia gate
[2:02:39.880 --> 2:02:41.880]  or what they're doing right now
[2:02:41.880 --> 2:02:43.880]  if the mainstream media was not complicit in it
[2:02:43.880 --> 2:02:45.880]  that's the other thing I was meant to tell people
[2:02:45.880 --> 2:02:47.880]  today which is
[2:02:47.880 --> 2:02:49.880]  do not listen to
[2:02:49.880 --> 2:02:51.880]  mainstream media I know your audience knows that
[2:02:51.880 --> 2:02:53.880]  but oh my gosh after what we saw with Fox
[2:02:53.880 --> 2:02:55.880]  declaring Arizona early
[2:02:55.880 --> 2:02:57.880]  and all of that
[2:02:57.880 --> 2:02:59.880]  it's Fox
[2:02:59.880 --> 2:03:01.880]  it's CNN, MSNBC you can't trust any of them
[2:03:01.880 --> 2:03:03.880]  but the information that I'm going to believe
[2:03:03.880 --> 2:03:05.880]  is what I hear coming from the president himself
[2:03:05.880 --> 2:03:07.880]  let me ask you this question because you are
[2:03:07.880 --> 2:03:09.880]  an insider for the patriot movement
[2:03:09.880 --> 2:03:11.880]  I was flipping out
[2:03:11.880 --> 2:03:13.880]  the day after the election saying okay
[2:03:13.880 --> 2:03:15.880]  I gave a 3 a.m. speech it was amazing
[2:03:15.880 --> 2:03:17.880]  I want to see him Oval Office
[2:03:17.880 --> 2:03:19.880]  addressing every fraud, fireside chat
[2:03:19.880 --> 2:03:21.880]  graphs showing it
[2:03:21.880 --> 2:03:23.880]  you know gateway pun and I think some of the best job
[2:03:23.880 --> 2:03:25.880]  overall analysis and fours on video the best
[2:03:25.880 --> 2:03:27.880]  but I don't care I just want to win
[2:03:27.880 --> 2:03:29.880]  he should be up there showing it
[2:03:29.880 --> 2:03:31.880]  and dead silent for a day and a half
[2:03:31.880 --> 2:03:33.880]  and then talking to the crew
[2:03:33.880 --> 2:03:35.880]  they all separately I went to different offices
[2:03:35.880 --> 2:03:37.880]  I respect people's actual view
[2:03:37.880 --> 2:03:39.880]  I say I was missing I'm like where is he
[2:03:39.880 --> 2:03:41.880]  he needs to be up front attacking
[2:03:41.880 --> 2:03:43.880]  he's waiting for the people to mobilize
[2:03:43.880 --> 2:03:45.880]  and he's going to see what we do it's now up to us
[2:03:45.880 --> 2:03:47.880]  and I think that clicked
[2:03:47.880 --> 2:03:49.880]  is that an accurate statement
[2:03:49.880 --> 2:03:51.880]  I mean it sounds
[2:03:51.880 --> 2:03:53.880]  like it can't go wrong
[2:03:53.880 --> 2:03:55.880]  so I'm going to say yes I feel the same way
[2:03:55.880 --> 2:03:57.880]  and I ask myself the same questions
[2:03:57.880 --> 2:03:59.880]  I was losing it
[2:03:59.880 --> 2:04:01.880]  when Biden did his
[2:04:01.880 --> 2:04:03.880]  his total
[2:04:03.880 --> 2:04:05.880]  info operation
[2:04:05.880 --> 2:04:07.880]  statement like that was a
[2:04:07.880 --> 2:04:09.880]  he looked more rubber in fact than ever
[2:04:09.880 --> 2:04:11.880]  and here's the thing
[2:04:11.880 --> 2:04:13.880]  that was so planned and rehearsed and timed
[2:04:13.880 --> 2:04:15.880]  because that campaign does not move
[2:04:15.880 --> 2:04:17.880]  sporadically the Trump campaign
[2:04:17.880 --> 2:04:19.880]  they can move on a dime
[2:04:19.880 --> 2:04:21.880]  the president makes decisions things happen just
[2:04:21.880 --> 2:04:23.880]  you know I'm going to make a speech I'm going to say this I'm going to tweet
[2:04:23.880 --> 2:04:25.880]  that Biden campaign
[2:04:25.880 --> 2:04:27.880]  it's like the Hillary campaign
[2:04:27.880 --> 2:04:29.880]  they had it set up for weeks that's what I'm saying
[2:04:29.880 --> 2:04:31.880]  they even had all the jeeps
[2:04:31.880 --> 2:04:33.880]  only jeeps
[2:04:33.880 --> 2:04:35.880]  it's all perfectly clean it was all
[2:04:35.880 --> 2:04:37.880]  scripted for months
[2:04:37.880 --> 2:04:39.880]  they even had like
[2:04:39.880 --> 2:04:41.880]  General Motors paying for it
[2:04:41.880 --> 2:04:43.880]  I got to say that was one of the creepiest moments of this whole election
[2:04:43.880 --> 2:04:45.880]  if we're just going to talk about vibes
[2:04:45.880 --> 2:04:47.880]  when I was watching the news
[2:04:47.880 --> 2:04:49.880]  play that the
[2:04:49.880 --> 2:04:51.880]  the motorcade going to do that I was like
[2:04:51.880 --> 2:04:53.880]  this feels so
[2:04:53.880 --> 2:04:55.880]  long there's something going on here this feels
[2:04:55.880 --> 2:04:57.880]  very very weird this is what it feels like
[2:04:57.880 --> 2:04:59.880]  to watch a coup takes place in real time
[2:04:59.880 --> 2:05:01.880]  well here's the thing I don't have words to describe
[2:05:01.880 --> 2:05:03.880]  in fact I feel guilty every
[2:05:03.880 --> 2:05:05.880]  millisecond Amanda
[2:05:05.880 --> 2:05:07.880]  that I'm not like
[2:05:07.880 --> 2:05:09.880]  going we're under attack it's a
[2:05:09.880 --> 2:05:11.880]  takeover the death of the country because we have a normalcy bias
[2:05:11.880 --> 2:05:13.880]  it's just America and we're fighting the left
[2:05:13.880 --> 2:05:15.880]  right notice how they've escalated the attacks
[2:05:15.880 --> 2:05:17.880]  killing police taking over government
[2:05:17.880 --> 2:05:19.880]  saying they hate America all their
[2:05:19.880 --> 2:05:21.880]  scams all their fraud and we're like
[2:05:21.880 --> 2:05:23.880]  kind of like a beaten
[2:05:23.880 --> 2:05:25.880]  woman or abuse
[2:05:25.880 --> 2:05:27.880]  person that we're just kind of used to being
[2:05:27.880 --> 2:05:29.880]  slapped upside the head
[2:05:29.880 --> 2:05:31.880]  and now we're getting punched we're getting hit with
[2:05:31.880 --> 2:05:33.880]  metal bars or breaking our bones they've
[2:05:33.880 --> 2:05:35.880]  pushed it so that's the frog in the boiling water
[2:05:35.880 --> 2:05:37.880]  they've pushed it and pushed it and pushed it and pushed it
[2:05:37.880 --> 2:05:39.880]  I mean it's again it's another reason why I made that movie
[2:05:39.880 --> 2:05:41.880]  is because you know they want you to forget
[2:05:41.880 --> 2:05:43.880]  this stuff they want they want us to not even
[2:05:43.880 --> 2:05:45.880]  talk about the fact that the last time we had an election
[2:05:45.880 --> 2:05:47.880]  they pretended the president
[2:05:47.880 --> 2:05:49.880]  was a Russian asset and it was
[2:05:49.880 --> 2:05:51.880]  proven that there was no connection whatsoever
[2:05:51.880 --> 2:05:53.880]  and that's what I'm saying is if he won
[2:05:53.880 --> 2:05:55.880]  fair and square I would say it's
[2:05:55.880 --> 2:05:57.880]  naked fraud we've caught them everywhere
[2:05:57.880 --> 2:05:59.880]  and their chai combat with
[2:05:59.880 --> 2:06:01.880]  foreign Indian troll farms
[2:06:01.880 --> 2:06:03.880]  so everything they said about Trump is what
[2:06:03.880 --> 2:06:05.880]  they've done I'm not accepting it
[2:06:05.880 --> 2:06:07.880]  I don't even thank God Trump isn't
[2:06:07.880 --> 2:06:09.880]  but this is going to be spectacular and I agree
[2:06:09.880 --> 2:06:11.880]  with the first thing you said when you got on talk more about that
[2:06:11.880 --> 2:06:13.880]  they're really setting this up to say Trump's
[2:06:13.880 --> 2:06:15.880]  stealing the election that's what I have I mean
[2:06:15.880 --> 2:06:17.880]  obviously look I don't know but I but
[2:06:17.880 --> 2:06:19.880]  what I get this gut feeling is that
[2:06:19.880 --> 2:06:21.880]  this is the extension of the same coup
[2:06:21.880 --> 2:06:23.880]  it's the same people same playbook behind
[2:06:23.880 --> 2:06:25.880]  it's the same playbook which is
[2:06:25.880 --> 2:06:27.880]  I feel like it's possible
[2:06:27.880 --> 2:06:29.880]  that the reason that they're doing this is because
[2:06:29.880 --> 2:06:31.880]  they want to anger and
[2:06:31.880 --> 2:06:33.880]  outrage their side more than
[2:06:33.880 --> 2:06:35.880]  ours this this this crazy
[2:06:35.880 --> 2:06:37.880]  moment we're in right now isn't actually aimed
[2:06:37.880 --> 2:06:39.880]  at us it's aimed at them
[2:06:39.880 --> 2:06:41.880]  because they know that we're going to win that's right
[2:06:41.880 --> 2:06:43.880]  they want to rage and then
[2:06:43.880 --> 2:06:45.880]  we stole it
[2:06:45.880 --> 2:06:47.880]  they're going to say oh look what he did in the courts
[2:06:47.880 --> 2:06:49.880]  it was like it was like Bush v Gore or whatever
[2:06:49.880 --> 2:06:51.880]  and they stole it on all these states are all
[2:06:51.880 --> 2:06:53.880]  knowing that's why the one you know
[2:06:53.880 --> 2:06:55.880]  what told me that when Fox did the Arizona
[2:06:55.880 --> 2:06:57.880]  call there was something I was like wow they're
[2:06:57.880 --> 2:06:59.880]  in on it that is weird it makes
[2:06:59.880 --> 2:07:01.880]  no sense you know I predicted that the day before
[2:07:01.880 --> 2:07:03.880]  you did that's incredible no no no no I know
[2:07:03.880 --> 2:07:05.880]  how they operate it was
[2:07:05.880 --> 2:07:07.880]  they they they they want Fox
[2:07:07.880 --> 2:07:09.880]  to do it so it's not the Democrats that's what I'm saying
[2:07:09.880 --> 2:07:11.880]  it's like word is and then afterwards
[2:07:11.880 --> 2:07:13.880]  exactly and then afterwards when they've got
[2:07:13.880 --> 2:07:15.880]  all their people burning down every single city
[2:07:15.880 --> 2:07:17.880]  they're going to say even Fox
[2:07:17.880 --> 2:07:19.880]  said that it was and Fox is on the side of the
[2:07:19.880 --> 2:07:21.880]  right that left right dichotomy
[2:07:21.880 --> 2:07:23.880]  and that they're always trying to like create for
[2:07:23.880 --> 2:07:25.880]  us even though we know it doesn't it was always a fraud
[2:07:25.880 --> 2:07:27.880]  until Trump came because he was a populist
[2:07:27.880 --> 2:07:29.880]  taking over Republicans yes exactly
[2:07:29.880 --> 2:07:31.880]  and that's and that's what they're going to use
[2:07:31.880 --> 2:07:33.880]  they're going to use this even Republicans
[2:07:33.880 --> 2:07:35.880]  are saying that you know he lost the election
[2:07:35.880 --> 2:07:37.880]  like that's what they're going to use guaranteed
[2:07:37.880 --> 2:07:39.880]  and it's absolutely
[2:07:39.880 --> 2:07:41.880]  not the case the fact that Fox was in on it is
[2:07:41.880 --> 2:07:43.880]  I mean you could see the the announcers
[2:07:43.880 --> 2:07:45.880]  Brett Bayer was shocked I mean
[2:07:45.880 --> 2:07:47.880]  he was sitting there going what is going on why did we call
[2:07:47.880 --> 2:07:49.880]  Trump was ahead when they did it right no
[2:07:49.880 --> 2:07:51.880]  he wasn't ahead but the the margins
[2:07:51.880 --> 2:07:53.880]  basically what you had was that all of the states that Trump
[2:07:53.880 --> 2:07:55.880]  was leading and the margins were
[2:07:55.880 --> 2:07:57.880]  bigger they were like we're not going to know I know a delegate
[2:07:57.880 --> 2:07:59.880]  counts right and that no no but in
[2:07:59.880 --> 2:08:01.880]  in in in votes and then Arizona
[2:08:01.880 --> 2:08:03.880]  it was completely likely
[2:08:03.880 --> 2:08:05.880]  that he would catch up and they were like no called it for
[2:08:05.880 --> 2:08:07.880]  Biden called and CNN hadn't even called
[2:08:07.880 --> 2:08:09.880]  it for Biden I mean it was insane they still haven't
[2:08:09.880 --> 2:08:11.880]  called it I mean what do they do if Trump
[2:08:11.880 --> 2:08:13.880]  defeats this
[2:08:13.880 --> 2:08:15.880]  like a snail on a straight razor to quote
[2:08:15.880 --> 2:08:17.880]  apocalypse now right now and the heart of darkness
[2:08:17.880 --> 2:08:19.880]  what do we
[2:08:19.880 --> 2:08:21.880]  what are they going to do
[2:08:21.880 --> 2:08:23.880]  when Trump wins they're going to burn
[2:08:23.880 --> 2:08:25.880]  everything down I mean there's a wreck I
[2:08:25.880 --> 2:08:27.880]  said there's a reason that they're they're
[2:08:27.880 --> 2:08:29.880]  boarding up the cities and
[2:08:29.880 --> 2:08:31.880]  I mean they're going to do everything they can to drag
[2:08:31.880 --> 2:08:33.880]  this out as long as possible
[2:08:33.880 --> 2:08:35.880]  if Biden had one
[2:08:35.880 --> 2:08:37.880]  we they wouldn't be dragging it out
[2:08:37.880 --> 2:08:39.880]  they'd be they'd be they'd be saying oh it's a slam
[2:08:39.880 --> 2:08:41.880]  down they would be counting as fast as they could
[2:08:41.880 --> 2:08:43.880]  right there and this is being drug out
[2:08:43.880 --> 2:08:45.880]  because they want to drag it out as long as possible
[2:08:45.880 --> 2:08:47.880]  until they can figure out a way to inject as many
[2:08:47.880 --> 2:08:49.880]  fraudulent ballots as many things as they can
[2:08:49.880 --> 2:08:51.880]  do to steal the election well my
[2:08:51.880 --> 2:08:53.880]  my brother in law
[2:08:53.880 --> 2:08:55.880]  a couple days ago was in Austin and there was a guy
[2:08:55.880 --> 2:08:57.880]  just filling out 50 ballots yeah we're just
[2:08:57.880 --> 2:08:59.880]  accepting I mean who knows what they're being nailed but
[2:08:59.880 --> 2:09:01.880]  look at all the stuff that's showing I mean they're doing videos
[2:09:01.880 --> 2:09:03.880]  are coming out like crazy now which again is why
[2:09:03.880 --> 2:09:05.880]  we got to make sure we're following people
[2:09:05.880 --> 2:09:07.880]  and Twitter and Facebook are banning them all
[2:09:07.880 --> 2:09:09.880]  they're going to start banning everything I mean
[2:09:09.880 --> 2:09:11.880]  in fact actually your producers
[2:09:11.880 --> 2:09:13.880]  just brought over the the proof of what we were talking
[2:09:13.880 --> 2:09:15.880]  about a minute ago which was that Facebook
[2:09:15.880 --> 2:09:17.880]  and this is from Ali Alexander that Facebook says
[2:09:17.880 --> 2:09:19.880]  they were 27,000
[2:09:19.880 --> 2:09:21.880]  Ali says there were 27,000 people strong
[2:09:21.880 --> 2:09:23.880]  and that
[2:09:23.880 --> 2:09:25.880]  that was in 36 hours they had that many people for
[2:09:25.880 --> 2:09:27.880]  stop the steal and Facebook just pulled it down
[2:09:27.880 --> 2:09:29.880]  most people they had 270,000
[2:09:29.880 --> 2:09:31.880]  strong let's talk about when we come back
[2:09:31.880 --> 2:09:33.880]  right yeah and then and then now boom
[2:09:33.880 --> 2:09:35.880]  they're all disappeared not
[2:09:35.880 --> 2:09:37.880]  allowing Americans to organize
[2:09:37.880 --> 2:09:39.880]  and demonstrate that's criminal censorship
[2:09:39.880 --> 2:09:41.880]  that's martial law
[2:09:41.880 --> 2:09:43.880]  that's Jeff Zuckerberg
[2:09:43.880 --> 2:09:45.880]  both of them and
[2:09:45.880 --> 2:09:47.880]  introducing info wars life
[2:09:47.880 --> 2:09:49.880]  pure turmeric extract
[2:09:49.880 --> 2:09:51.880]  this is taken under the tongue
[2:09:51.880 --> 2:09:53.880]  it is pure turmeric
[2:09:53.880 --> 2:09:55.880]  it goes together
[2:09:55.880 --> 2:09:57.880]  very well with our body's ultimate
[2:09:57.880 --> 2:09:59.880]  turmeric formula that is taken
[2:09:59.880 --> 2:10:01.880]  as a powdered capsule and absorbed
[2:10:01.880 --> 2:10:03.880]  in the stomach and intestines
[2:10:03.880 --> 2:10:05.880]  this is absorbed under the tongue
[2:10:05.880 --> 2:10:07.880]  into the bloodstream and then the remaining
[2:10:07.880 --> 2:10:09.880]  also is then absorbed by the stomach
[2:10:09.880 --> 2:10:11.880]  so it's more of an intense delivery
[2:10:11.880 --> 2:10:13.880]  system the two formulas
[2:10:13.880 --> 2:10:15.880]  are different but both are concentrates
[2:10:15.880 --> 2:10:17.880]  and our first product got rave reviews
[2:10:17.880 --> 2:10:19.880]  we've now been testing this out for several months
[2:10:19.880 --> 2:10:21.880]  some of our staff like it more than bodies
[2:10:21.880 --> 2:10:23.880]  some like bodies better for me
[2:10:23.880 --> 2:10:25.880]  they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory
[2:10:25.880 --> 2:10:27.880]  action and so much more and they fund the info war
[2:10:27.880 --> 2:10:29.880]  so get our new liquid turmeric
[2:10:29.880 --> 2:10:31.880]  extract exclusively
[2:10:31.880 --> 2:10:33.880]  this is a 360 win
[2:10:37.880 --> 2:10:39.880]  turmeric is renowned for what it does
[2:10:39.880 --> 2:10:41.880]  for all of our bodies for inflammation
[2:10:41.880 --> 2:10:43.880]  and so much more get yours today
[2:10:43.880 --> 2:10:45.880]  at infowarslife.com
[2:10:45.880 --> 2:10:47.880]  look it up for yourself
[2:10:47.880 --> 2:10:49.880]  the head of the devos group issued a report
[2:10:49.880 --> 2:10:51.880]  one six months ago calling for
[2:10:51.880 --> 2:10:53.880]  world government to be openly established
[2:10:53.880 --> 2:10:55.880]  to respond to covid-19
[2:10:55.880 --> 2:10:57.880]  the covid-19 was a blessing
[2:10:57.880 --> 2:10:59.880]  to lower the planet's carbon footprint
[2:10:59.880 --> 2:11:01.880]  since then Prince Charles
[2:11:01.880 --> 2:11:03.880]  and countless others have come out
[2:11:03.880 --> 2:11:05.880]  and said the exact same thing
[2:11:05.880 --> 2:11:07.880]  the most ancient form
[2:11:07.880 --> 2:11:09.880]  of total war is called
[2:11:09.880 --> 2:11:11.880]  siege
[2:11:11.880 --> 2:11:13.880]  that's when you cut people off
[2:11:13.880 --> 2:11:15.880]  from their resources that's when you lock them down
[2:11:15.880 --> 2:11:17.880]  and this isn't siege
[2:11:17.880 --> 2:11:19.880]  to make us capitulate to the globalist
[2:11:19.880 --> 2:11:21.880]  or just get rid of Donald Trump that's only part of it
[2:11:21.880 --> 2:11:23.880]  this is siege to literally train us
[2:11:23.880 --> 2:11:25.880]  to be poor and to get us into deep
[2:11:25.880 --> 2:11:27.880]  debt so then
[2:11:27.880 --> 2:11:29.880]  the globalist social engineers
[2:11:29.880 --> 2:11:31.880]  can dictate how we live our lives
[2:11:31.880 --> 2:11:33.880]  with the social credit score
[2:11:33.880 --> 2:11:35.880]  surveillance grid
[2:11:35.880 --> 2:11:37.880]  so you've heard the US Army saying
[2:11:37.880 --> 2:11:39.880]  our job is to kill people and break things
[2:11:39.880 --> 2:11:41.880]  well that's what the lockdown is doing
[2:11:41.880 --> 2:11:43.880]  it's starving the third world
[2:11:43.880 --> 2:11:45.880]  millions and millions of death
[2:11:45.880 --> 2:11:47.880]  it's breaking down the supply chain in society
[2:11:47.880 --> 2:11:57.880]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:12:17.880 --> 2:12:19.880]  Amanda Millius is our guest
[2:12:19.880 --> 2:12:21.880]  filmmaker
[2:12:21.880 --> 2:12:23.880]  formerly work
[2:12:23.880 --> 2:12:25.880]  Trump State Department
[2:12:25.880 --> 2:12:27.880]  we're showing footage in Atlanta
[2:12:27.880 --> 2:12:29.880]  Georgia where she's about to jump on an airplane
[2:12:29.880 --> 2:12:31.880]  and go next
[2:12:31.880 --> 2:12:33.880]  where they've paid vans
[2:12:33.880 --> 2:12:35.880]  the same vans
[2:12:35.880 --> 2:12:37.880]  black and white vans driving circles
[2:12:37.880 --> 2:12:39.880]  in front of the news cameras
[2:12:39.880 --> 2:12:41.880]  to block citizens protesting
[2:12:41.880 --> 2:12:43.880]  to stop the steal
[2:12:43.880 --> 2:12:45.880]  and now the Democrats have had a press conference
[2:12:45.880 --> 2:12:47.880]  that
[2:12:47.880 --> 2:12:49.880]  Biden has narrowed the Georgia lead
[2:12:49.880 --> 2:12:51.880]  and they're stuffing more ballot boxes
[2:12:51.880 --> 2:12:53.880]  so
[2:12:53.880 --> 2:12:55.880]  Amanda this is a very scary moment
[2:12:55.880 --> 2:12:57.880]  we cannot let these criminals steal the selection
[2:12:57.880 --> 2:12:59.880]  no and like we've been saying
[2:12:59.880 --> 2:13:01.880]  this is exactly what they want to do
[2:13:01.880 --> 2:13:03.880]  they want to send their people out to intimidate
[2:13:03.880 --> 2:13:05.880]  ours they claim that we're the ones doing
[2:13:05.880 --> 2:13:07.880]  the intimidating when we are citizens
[2:13:07.880 --> 2:13:09.880]  gathering and
[2:13:09.880 --> 2:13:11.880]  total grassroots
[2:13:11.880 --> 2:13:13.880]  completely organic
[2:13:13.880 --> 2:13:15.880]  not knowing where to go and what to do the day after the election
[2:13:15.880 --> 2:13:17.880]  and everybody contacting Ali
[2:13:17.880 --> 2:13:19.880]  stop the steal
[2:13:19.880 --> 2:13:21.880]  just blowing up the next day
[2:13:21.880 --> 2:13:23.880]  and then they're going to send these paid vans
[2:13:23.880 --> 2:13:25.880]  to circle and intimidate our
[2:13:25.880 --> 2:13:27.880]  citizen protesters
[2:13:27.880 --> 2:13:29.880]  what is the point of that
[2:13:29.880 --> 2:13:31.880]  hundreds of vans driving in circles
[2:13:31.880 --> 2:13:33.880]  block them from
[2:13:33.880 --> 2:13:35.880]  it's all these white vans
[2:13:35.880 --> 2:13:37.880]  it looks like the white vans
[2:13:37.880 --> 2:13:39.880]  of the deep state coming to throw a bunch of
[2:13:39.880 --> 2:13:41.880]  we're going to grab you
[2:13:41.880 --> 2:13:43.880]  but it's really freaky
[2:13:43.880 --> 2:13:45.880]  it's really weird
[2:13:45.880 --> 2:13:47.880]  show Alex Jones and scanner darkly guys
[2:13:47.880 --> 2:13:49.880]  get grabbed in a van
[2:13:49.880 --> 2:13:51.880]  it's ridiculous
[2:13:51.880 --> 2:13:53.880]  this is the thing
[2:13:53.880 --> 2:13:55.880]  of course the media is not covering that
[2:13:55.880 --> 2:13:57.880]  they're not saying there's all these spontaneous protests
[2:13:57.880 --> 2:13:59.880]  showing up at least they did cover the Cernovich event
[2:13:59.880 --> 2:14:01.880]  in Arizona a little bit
[2:14:01.880 --> 2:14:03.880]  Cernovich got to Arizona in
[2:14:03.880 --> 2:14:05.880]  a couple hours
[2:14:05.880 --> 2:14:07.880]  he was like I'm there, I'm going
[2:14:07.880 --> 2:14:09.880]  and he gathered all those people
[2:14:09.880 --> 2:14:11.880]  what's happening right now is everybody's putting aside
[2:14:11.880 --> 2:14:13.880]  any kind of
[2:14:13.880 --> 2:14:15.880]  critiques of the administration
[2:14:15.880 --> 2:14:17.880]  or whatever's happening and they're just jumping in
[2:14:17.880 --> 2:14:19.880]  because this moment is everything
[2:14:19.880 --> 2:14:21.880]  I agree with you
[2:14:21.880 --> 2:14:23.880]  I'm kind of here in the nerve center
[2:14:23.880 --> 2:14:25.880]  trying to get guests on and cover things
[2:14:25.880 --> 2:14:27.880]  I guess I should go somewhere
[2:14:27.880 --> 2:14:29.880]  should it be Arizona
[2:14:29.880 --> 2:14:31.880]  should it be Georgia
[2:14:31.880 --> 2:14:33.880]  they're going to steal Georgia
[2:14:33.880 --> 2:14:35.880]  I would say Georgia or Arizona
[2:14:35.880 --> 2:14:37.880]  you come with us just jump in
[2:14:37.880 --> 2:14:39.880]  we got a flight just hop in come with us
[2:14:39.880 --> 2:14:41.880]  we'll take the info wars armored car
[2:14:41.880 --> 2:14:43.880]  and we'll just cruise over to Georgia
[2:14:43.880 --> 2:14:45.880]  but no I mean this is really important
[2:14:45.880 --> 2:14:47.880]  like people the reason that as I said before
[2:14:47.880 --> 2:14:49.880]  I mean you were the test run
[2:14:49.880 --> 2:14:51.880]  you have the power to motivate large
[2:14:51.880 --> 2:14:53.880]  groups of people to do things
[2:14:53.880 --> 2:14:55.880]  I remember in 2016
[2:14:55.880 --> 2:14:57.880]  everybody was gathering
[2:14:57.880 --> 2:14:59.880]  in the parking lots handing out Hillary for prison
[2:14:59.880 --> 2:15:01.880]  stickers and it was really
[2:15:01.880 --> 2:15:03.880]  it was like a motivating force and I mean
[2:15:03.880 --> 2:15:05.880]  that's the reason that they came after you first
[2:15:05.880 --> 2:15:07.880]  we were all screaming about it saying
[2:15:07.880 --> 2:15:09.880]  if you kick off people like Alex Jones
[2:15:09.880 --> 2:15:11.880]  and Laura Loomer and all the people
[2:15:11.880 --> 2:15:13.880]  that are actually you know able to
[2:15:13.880 --> 2:15:15.880]  motivate the movement
[2:15:15.880 --> 2:15:17.880]  this is why it's for today
[2:15:17.880 --> 2:15:19.880]  the reason they did it is because
[2:15:19.880 --> 2:15:21.880]  of today by the way Laura didn't
[2:15:21.880 --> 2:15:23.880]  didn't lose running that uphill battle she won
[2:15:23.880 --> 2:15:25.880]  yeah and so we need to get her back
[2:15:25.880 --> 2:15:27.880]  in the field as well it's an absolute victory
[2:15:27.880 --> 2:15:29.880]  I mean the Republicans that basically seeded
[2:15:29.880 --> 2:15:31.880]  that that district I mean it's
[2:15:31.880 --> 2:15:33.880]  it's she should she should get out
[2:15:33.880 --> 2:15:35.880]  and lead the march to one of these
[2:15:35.880 --> 2:15:37.880]  to one of these cities and here's an example
[2:15:37.880 --> 2:15:39.880]  Ali Alexander
[2:15:39.880 --> 2:15:41.880]  270,000 in my eyesight
[2:15:41.880 --> 2:15:43.880]  is right people in just a day
[2:15:43.880 --> 2:15:45.880]  on Facebook saying we're going to
[2:15:45.880 --> 2:15:47.880]  organize we're going to protest we believe there's fraud
[2:15:47.880 --> 2:15:49.880]  that's total protected First Amendment
[2:15:49.880 --> 2:15:51.880]  grass grass roots Facebook
[2:15:51.880 --> 2:15:53.880]  bands it that's election meddling right there
[2:15:53.880 --> 2:15:55.880]  yeah absolutely and
[2:15:55.880 --> 2:15:57.880]  and you know
[2:15:57.880 --> 2:15:59.880]  think about the amount of people that this
[2:15:59.880 --> 2:16:01.880]  time last this time last election
[2:16:01.880 --> 2:16:03.880]  we were able to see what they said every day
[2:16:03.880 --> 2:16:05.880]  on Instagram on Twitter on Facebook
[2:16:05.880 --> 2:16:07.880]  on all these different things and
[2:16:07.880 --> 2:16:09.880]  think about how how many are gone
[2:16:09.880 --> 2:16:11.880]  I mean some of the most entertaining people in
[2:16:11.880 --> 2:16:13.880]  our movement they're just they're just gone off
[2:16:13.880 --> 2:16:15.880]  the internet and that's what they wanted and you have
[2:16:15.880 --> 2:16:17.880]  that's why we were blessed to have AM and FM
[2:16:17.880 --> 2:16:19.880]  radio stations TV stations and hardcore listeners
[2:16:19.880 --> 2:16:21.880]  go to info wars dot com four slash
[2:16:21.880 --> 2:16:23.880]  newsletters we get right to them but as
[2:16:23.880 --> 2:16:25.880]  this desert
[2:16:25.880 --> 2:16:27.880]  of censorship expands these OACs
[2:16:27.880 --> 2:16:29.880]  are more important than ever that's why
[2:16:29.880 --> 2:16:31.880]  keeping info wars on the air as a platform
[2:16:31.880 --> 2:16:33.880]  where everybody's want to thank listeners for
[2:16:33.880 --> 2:16:35.880]  their support I've been so focused the last
[2:16:35.880 --> 2:16:37.880]  few days with it with the
[2:16:37.880 --> 2:16:39.880]  election
[2:16:39.880 --> 2:16:41.880]  we're losing money right now because I've not been plugging stuff but that's okay
[2:16:41.880 --> 2:16:43.880]  it's just this is this is a war
[2:16:43.880 --> 2:16:45.880]  this is not regular times
[2:16:45.880 --> 2:16:47.880]  no this and you predicted this again
[2:16:47.880 --> 2:16:49.880]  you can't say it enough you predicted it
[2:16:49.880 --> 2:16:51.880]  you were right you were absolutely
[2:16:51.880 --> 2:16:53.880]  right again
[2:16:53.880 --> 2:16:55.880]  the Democrats said they were going to do this right
[2:16:55.880 --> 2:16:57.880]  you you just were the only one that would call it out
[2:16:57.880 --> 2:16:59.880]  like I don't know why Republicans are like
[2:16:59.880 --> 2:17:01.880]  saying they're going to do this yeah and then
[2:17:01.880 --> 2:17:03.880]  Republicans wouldn't do anything like oh we're going to win
[2:17:03.880 --> 2:17:05.880]  landslide no it's it's it's unbelievable
[2:17:05.880 --> 2:17:07.880]  I don't know it drove me nuts because you know
[2:17:07.880 --> 2:17:09.880]  we saw a lot of this kind of corruption in
[2:17:09.880 --> 2:17:11.880]  2016 when I was a volunteer in Las Vegas
[2:17:11.880 --> 2:17:13.880]  we saw cars parked in the
[2:17:13.880 --> 2:17:15.880]  middle of dirt parking lots
[2:17:15.880 --> 2:17:17.880]  filled with cartridges and ballots
[2:17:17.880 --> 2:17:19.880]  with the lights on and the doors open
[2:17:19.880 --> 2:17:21.880]  just sitting there and our poll watchers would like
[2:17:21.880 --> 2:17:23.880]  find them or get in car
[2:17:23.880 --> 2:17:25.880]  chases to follow ballots to the
[2:17:25.880 --> 2:17:27.880]  polling obviously this has been going on
[2:17:27.880 --> 2:17:29.880]  Biden has empty parking lots Trump has
[2:17:29.880 --> 2:17:31.880]  100,000 20,000 40,000
[2:17:31.880 --> 2:17:33.880]  obviously it's a giant wall
[2:17:33.880 --> 2:17:35.880]  of fraud and that still wasn't enough and they're
[2:17:35.880 --> 2:17:37.880]  freaked out they want to announce victory
[2:17:37.880 --> 2:17:39.880]  on Tuesday night it didn't happen they're
[2:17:39.880 --> 2:17:41.880]  wrapping their bridges right no and they're
[2:17:41.880 --> 2:17:43.880]  what they're doing is a play we're watching
[2:17:43.880 --> 2:17:45.880]  a play they learned from
[2:17:45.880 --> 2:17:47.880]  the Gore Bush they remember
[2:17:47.880 --> 2:17:49.880]  that they're from the Gore Bush fights
[2:17:49.880 --> 2:17:51.880]  that having him come out early
[2:17:51.880 --> 2:17:53.880]  like that and and say well we're not
[2:17:53.880 --> 2:17:55.880]  going to say anything yet but
[2:17:55.880 --> 2:17:57.880]  we think we can win this and blah blah
[2:17:57.880 --> 2:17:59.880]  blah like coming out first
[2:17:59.880 --> 2:18:01.880]  is a power move that's a
[2:18:01.880 --> 2:18:03.880]  strategic
[2:18:03.880 --> 2:18:05.880]  communication move the other thing it reminds
[2:18:05.880 --> 2:18:07.880]  me and a lot of people forgot about this remember in
[2:18:07.880 --> 2:18:09.880]  2016 when Hillary didn't concede
[2:18:09.880 --> 2:18:11.880]  and Podesta came crawling out
[2:18:11.880 --> 2:18:13.880]  from behind the curtain and was
[2:18:13.880 --> 2:18:15.880]  like a roach
[2:18:15.880 --> 2:18:17.880]  everyone just relax we'll have
[2:18:17.880 --> 2:18:19.880]  something to say to you people tomorrow
[2:18:19.880 --> 2:18:21.880]  like that whole thing that's what it reminded
[2:18:21.880 --> 2:18:23.880]  me of I'm like when's Podesta coming crawling
[2:18:23.880 --> 2:18:25.880]  out of the rock and this time they just
[2:18:25.880 --> 2:18:27.880]  froze the states where Democrats control
[2:18:27.880 --> 2:18:29.880]  things right because they're about to lose
[2:18:29.880 --> 2:18:31.880]  power and they're being promised we're
[2:18:31.880 --> 2:18:33.880]  going to get in the Justice Department will protect you
[2:18:33.880 --> 2:18:35.880]  and that's Trump's failing
[2:18:35.880 --> 2:18:37.880]  with Barr and all of them they never prosecuted
[2:18:37.880 --> 2:18:39.880]  any of these deep staters so they said well let's try
[2:18:39.880 --> 2:18:41.880]  one more really big scam yeah that's why
[2:18:41.880 --> 2:18:43.880]  they're doing people you know what it is people
[2:18:43.880 --> 2:18:45.880]  do what they get away with that that's again
[2:18:45.880 --> 2:18:47.880]  why I made this movie and why it's
[2:18:47.880 --> 2:18:49.880]  so important that people get held
[2:18:49.880 --> 2:18:51.880]  to account plot against the president plot against
[2:18:51.880 --> 2:18:53.880]  the president available on Amazon it's
[2:18:53.880 --> 2:18:55.880]  free on Amazon Prime right now
[2:18:55.880 --> 2:18:57.880]  it's the number one documentary on Amazon it's
[2:18:57.880 --> 2:18:59.880]  shot to the big their algorithm couldn't stop
[2:18:59.880 --> 2:19:01.880]  it below one and a half stars to
[2:19:01.880 --> 2:19:03.880]  and and that's and they like I said they held it
[2:19:03.880 --> 2:19:05.880]  for 12 days which is
[2:19:05.880 --> 2:19:07.880]  unheard of our distributor has over
[2:19:07.880 --> 2:19:09.880]  350 different titles on
[2:19:09.880 --> 2:19:11.880]  I'm sure it's another form of meddling but
[2:19:11.880 --> 2:19:13.880]  yeah it's actually our name it down it
[2:19:13.880 --> 2:19:15.880]  been up there for years right millions
[2:19:15.880 --> 2:19:17.880]  of years I just torched it because
[2:19:17.880 --> 2:19:19.880]  they don't want people to see these kind of
[2:19:19.880 --> 2:19:21.880]  political movies they want them to see this
[2:19:21.880 --> 2:19:23.880]  predicts everything they did 13 years right
[2:19:23.880 --> 2:19:25.880]  all of your documentaries have been extremely
[2:19:25.880 --> 2:19:27.880]  predictive it's time to dust those off and get
[2:19:27.880 --> 2:19:29.880]  those out if we want to know what's about to happen
[2:19:29.880 --> 2:19:31.880]  in the next few days I would say we need to be
[2:19:31.880 --> 2:19:33.880]  that's the secret I was like how do you know this
[2:19:33.880 --> 2:19:35.880]  I've learned the Rockefellers and these
[2:19:35.880 --> 2:19:37.880]  people and they're not playing games man
[2:19:37.880 --> 2:19:39.880]  no they're not David Rockefeller wrote two articles
[2:19:39.880 --> 2:19:41.880]  of the New York Times in the 70s saying
[2:19:41.880 --> 2:19:43.880]  now say tongues wonderful we want to bring this
[2:19:43.880 --> 2:19:45.880]  to America we're going to do it now say tongue
[2:19:45.880 --> 2:19:47.880]  million people I mean I
[2:19:47.880 --> 2:19:49.880]  this is their they're doing it and they want
[2:19:49.880 --> 2:19:51.880]  us to forget they do the absolutely
[2:19:51.880 --> 2:19:53.880]  and and also you know the bushes
[2:19:53.880 --> 2:19:55.880]  are the ones that bridged the brought
[2:19:55.880 --> 2:19:57.880]  China the thing we're suffering under
[2:19:57.880 --> 2:19:59.880]  now really can be traced back to the bushes
[2:19:59.880 --> 2:20:01.880]  it's a cancerous
[2:20:01.880 --> 2:20:03.880]  parasitic communist Chinese are
[2:20:03.880 --> 2:20:05.880]  given one-sided trade deals
[2:20:05.880 --> 2:20:07.880]  and are sucking off us transferring our wealth
[2:20:07.880 --> 2:20:09.880]  and they're our biggest enemy I mean this was
[2:20:09.880 --> 2:20:11.880]  the crazy thing when I was working at the State Department
[2:20:11.880 --> 2:20:13.880]  where we're supposed to have the top experts in
[2:20:13.880 --> 2:20:15.880]  the country deciding our foreign policy
[2:20:15.880 --> 2:20:17.880]  and they're sitting there chasing
[2:20:17.880 --> 2:20:19.880]  Russian collusion around
[2:20:19.880 --> 2:20:21.880]  like it's a real thing it's not real
[2:20:21.880 --> 2:20:23.880]  meanwhile China is eating our lunch and they won't even
[2:20:23.880 --> 2:20:25.880]  call them our enemy I mean it was
[2:20:25.880 --> 2:20:27.880]  it was a man in the Middle East are you

[2:20:41.880 --> 2:20:43.880]  the next week
[2:20:43.880 --> 2:20:45.880]  I get asked all the time by
[2:20:45.880 --> 2:20:47.880]  listeners and by the media what am I
[2:20:47.880 --> 2:20:49.880]  most proud of when it comes to the show
[2:20:49.880 --> 2:20:51.880]  and it's the fact that info wars more than
[2:20:51.880 --> 2:20:53.880]  25 years ago doing basic research
[2:20:53.880 --> 2:20:55.880]  with what the club of Rome and the CFR
[2:20:55.880 --> 2:20:57.880]  and others were actually saying
[2:20:57.880 --> 2:20:59.880]  developed the hypothesis that
[2:20:59.880 --> 2:21:01.880]  communist China had been set up to take
[2:21:01.880 --> 2:21:03.880]  our jobs and transfer them to China
[2:21:03.880 --> 2:21:05.880]  and then make us economically destitute and position us
[2:21:05.880 --> 2:21:07.880]  into debt well now China
[2:21:07.880 --> 2:21:09.880]  owns the debt now China owns Hollywood
[2:21:09.880 --> 2:21:11.880]  all the one-sided trading deals
[2:21:11.880 --> 2:21:13.880]  it turns out our analysis was absolutely
[2:21:13.880 --> 2:21:15.880]  dead on but again it wasn't that hard
[2:21:15.880 --> 2:21:17.880]  the CFR and others admitted
[2:21:17.880 --> 2:21:19.880]  what they were doing but still
[2:21:19.880 --> 2:21:21.880]  others didn't want to focus on that
[2:21:21.880 --> 2:21:23.880]  issue we did and you focused on it
[2:21:23.880 --> 2:21:25.880]  by supporting us and info wars

[2:26:09.880 --> 2:26:11.880]  this is in violation of the law
[2:26:11.880 --> 2:26:13.880]  the appeals court ruled the ballots
[2:26:13.880 --> 2:26:15.880]  have to come in at 8 o'clock on November 3
[2:26:15.880 --> 2:26:17.880]  but he was informed to quote
[2:26:17.880 --> 2:26:19.880]  separate them from the standard letter mail
[2:26:19.880 --> 2:26:21.880]  so they can hand stamp them with yesterday's date
[2:26:21.880 --> 2:26:23.880]  and put them through
[2:26:23.880 --> 2:26:25.880]  Alex this is a postal worker a whistleblower
[2:26:25.880 --> 2:26:27.880]  he interviewed me in the shadows
[2:26:27.880 --> 2:26:29.880]  I know his real name
[2:26:29.880 --> 2:26:31.880]  our journalists are outside
[2:26:31.880 --> 2:26:33.880]  their office there in Michigan
[2:26:33.880 --> 2:26:35.880]  by the inspector general
[2:26:35.880 --> 2:26:37.880]  of the post office called
[2:26:37.880 --> 2:26:39.880]  my lawyer late last night
[2:26:39.880 --> 2:26:41.880]  White House counsel on it
[2:26:41.880 --> 2:26:43.880]  so they're investigating this
[2:26:43.880 --> 2:26:45.880]  but people say there's no fraud
[2:26:45.880 --> 2:26:47.880]  we're talking about back dating ballots
[2:26:47.880 --> 2:26:49.880]  the violation of the law there in Michigan
[2:26:49.880 --> 2:26:51.880]  Alex which is the battleground state
[2:26:51.880 --> 2:26:53.880]  has been called for by them
[2:26:53.880 --> 2:26:55.880]  that's right and now they're closing in
[2:26:55.880 --> 2:26:57.880]  on Georgia we're going to play the video
[2:26:57.880 --> 2:26:59.880]  after you leave us James O'Keefe
[2:26:59.880 --> 2:27:01.880]  I know you're in a cab driving
[2:27:01.880 --> 2:27:03.880]  with folks in the magnitude
[2:27:03.880 --> 2:27:05.880]  and I know you're always about the news
[2:27:05.880 --> 2:27:07.880]  and what you expose
[2:27:07.880 --> 2:27:09.880]  but as a citizen as an American
[2:27:09.880 --> 2:27:11.880]  knowing they're trying to steal this election
[2:27:11.880 --> 2:27:13.880]  knowing they've been caught
[2:27:13.880 --> 2:27:15.880]  just as an American what do you think
[2:27:15.880 --> 2:27:17.880]  other Americans should be doing right now
[2:27:17.880 --> 2:27:19.880]  I think they should be wearing cameras right now
[2:27:19.880 --> 2:27:21.880]  I think we need an army of whistleblowers
[2:27:21.880 --> 2:27:23.880]  again this is a whistleblower
[2:27:23.880 --> 2:27:25.880]  in Michigan a postal worker
[2:27:25.880 --> 2:27:27.880]  who blew the whistle on the fact
[2:27:27.880 --> 2:27:29.880]  they were back dating ballots
[2:27:29.880 --> 2:27:31.880]  even though they were referred
[2:27:31.880 --> 2:27:33.880]  even though they were received after the election
[2:27:33.880 --> 2:27:35.880]  which is against the law
[2:27:35.880 --> 2:27:37.880]  he blew the whistle we need a thousand people
[2:27:37.880 --> 2:27:39.880]  like him Alex these are brave
[2:27:39.880 --> 2:27:41.880]  salt of the earth people
[2:27:41.880 --> 2:27:43.880]  who just go to work and do their jobs
[2:27:43.880 --> 2:27:45.880]  and are sick and tired I asked them
[2:27:45.880 --> 2:27:47.880]  why did you do this are you afraid of retaliation
[2:27:47.880 --> 2:27:49.880]  he said I'm not afraid of retaliation
[2:27:49.880 --> 2:27:51.880]  I just want the people to know what's going on
[2:27:51.880 --> 2:27:53.880]  there are a toss tips at protonmail.com
[2:27:53.880 --> 2:27:55.880]  if you're out there and you're seeing this fraud
[2:27:55.880 --> 2:27:57.880]  we'll tell your story
[2:27:57.880 --> 2:27:59.880]  James you've got your ear to the ground
[2:27:59.880 --> 2:28:01.880]  normally when I get you on it's about the stories you're breaking
[2:28:01.880 --> 2:28:03.880]  I know you talk to the White House
[2:28:03.880 --> 2:28:05.880]  we have some connections but
[2:28:05.880 --> 2:28:07.880]  why is Trump silent he had a great speech
[2:28:07.880 --> 2:28:09.880]  Wednesday morning at 3am
[2:28:09.880 --> 2:28:11.880]  laid out the truth
[2:28:11.880 --> 2:28:13.880]  Biden's running around
[2:28:13.880 --> 2:28:15.880]  is he waiting for citizens to rally
[2:28:15.880 --> 2:28:17.880]  which is happening where is Trump
[2:28:17.880 --> 2:28:19.880]  we should get an oval office address
[2:28:19.880 --> 2:28:21.880]  he should be playing project Veritas videos
[2:28:21.880 --> 2:28:23.880]  and chronically the fraud explaining his case
[2:28:23.880 --> 2:28:25.880]  where is Trump
[2:28:25.880 --> 2:28:27.880]  I don't know the answer to that
[2:28:27.880 --> 2:28:29.880]  Alex I think a lot of people sit on the fence
[2:28:29.880 --> 2:28:31.880]  everybody who is watching
[2:28:31.880 --> 2:28:33.880]  should be fighting this nonsense
[2:28:33.880 --> 2:28:35.880]  not sitting on the sideline
[2:28:35.880 --> 2:28:37.880]  I think generally speaking Republicans have been weak
[2:28:37.880 --> 2:28:39.880]  for decades and allow these things to happen
[2:28:39.880 --> 2:28:41.880]  they're afraid of being called
[2:28:41.880 --> 2:28:43.880]  names being called racist disenfranchising
[2:28:43.880 --> 2:28:45.880]  voters
[2:28:45.880 --> 2:28:47.880]  the media
[2:28:47.880 --> 2:28:49.880]  has so much power
[2:28:49.880 --> 2:28:51.880]  although these videos have got to be 10 million
[2:28:51.880 --> 2:28:53.880]  people by the way
[2:28:53.880 --> 2:28:55.880]  but the media has this almost
[2:28:55.880 --> 2:28:57.880]  religious belief that fraud doesn't occur
[2:28:57.880 --> 2:28:59.880]  and it's an irrational
[2:28:59.880 --> 2:29:01.880]  belief that widespread fraud
[2:29:01.880 --> 2:29:03.880]  cannot exist and their
[2:29:03.880 --> 2:29:05.880]  orthodoxy prevents them from believing
[2:29:05.880 --> 2:29:07.880]  these visuals these truths
[2:29:07.880 --> 2:29:09.880]  so I think people are afraid
[2:29:09.880 --> 2:29:11.880]  I don't know what's why Trump is not
[2:29:11.880 --> 2:29:13.880]  mentioning this video but I do know
[2:29:13.880 --> 2:29:15.880]  the White House is aware of it
[2:29:15.880 --> 2:29:17.880]  Inspector General is on it they're suing Michigan
[2:29:17.880 --> 2:29:19.880]  they're going to be launching more lawsuits
[2:29:19.880 --> 2:29:21.880]  but what we need today is
[2:29:21.880 --> 2:29:23.880]  more people at the polls
[2:29:23.880 --> 2:29:25.880]  people who are poll watchers
[2:29:25.880 --> 2:29:27.880]  people who handle ballots to blow the whistle
[2:29:27.880 --> 2:29:29.880]  in an army of whistleblowers
[2:29:29.880 --> 2:29:31.880]  I can't emphasize this enough
[2:29:31.880 --> 2:29:33.880]  now is the time, today, tonight
[2:29:33.880 --> 2:29:35.880]  for you to do this
[2:29:35.880 --> 2:29:37.880]  absolutely don't wait our destiny, our future
[2:29:37.880 --> 2:29:39.880]  our very birthrights being stolen
[2:29:39.880 --> 2:29:41.880]  in closing though I'm going to play your clip when you leave
[2:29:43.880 --> 2:29:45.880]  the public is waking up to this
[2:29:45.880 --> 2:29:47.880]  I mean you talk about evidence
[2:29:47.880 --> 2:29:49.880]  Fox News is like where's the evidence of fraud
[2:29:49.880 --> 2:29:51.880]  hundreds of thousands of ballots
[2:29:51.880 --> 2:29:53.880]  all of them are for Biden
[2:29:53.880 --> 2:29:55.880]  27,000 in Philadelphia all for Biden
[2:29:55.880 --> 2:29:57.880]  they're catching and still getting new ballots
[2:29:57.880 --> 2:29:59.880]  in Georgia I mean this is
[2:29:59.880 --> 2:30:01.880]  transparent they have caught them with their
[2:30:01.880 --> 2:30:03.880]  pants down well we need more evidence
[2:30:03.880 --> 2:30:05.880]  we just need more video that's all
[2:30:05.880 --> 2:30:07.880]  there is we just need more and more and more
[2:30:07.880 --> 2:30:09.880]  video yes they've caught it
[2:30:09.880 --> 2:30:11.880]  people aren't being prosecuted at least not
[2:30:11.880 --> 2:30:13.880]  yet but right now I know they're launching
[2:30:13.880 --> 2:30:15.880]  a lawsuit in Michigan
[2:30:15.880 --> 2:30:17.880]  I know with the
[2:30:17.880 --> 2:30:19.880]  United States Postal Service got to my channel
[2:30:19.880 --> 2:30:21.880]  counsel and said that they're reviewing the
[2:30:21.880 --> 2:30:23.880]  matter and they're investigating so we just need
[2:30:23.880 --> 2:30:25.880]  a thousand more pieces of video evidence
[2:30:25.880 --> 2:30:27.880]  and we need critical mass and we need it now
[2:30:27.880 --> 2:30:29.880]  and again it's mainly female lawyers
[2:30:29.880 --> 2:30:31.880]  in the middle of the night catching them sneaking ballots
[2:30:31.880 --> 2:30:33.880]  in I'm just saying it's mainly women
[2:30:33.880 --> 2:30:35.880]  we need everybody staking out
[2:30:35.880 --> 2:30:37.880]  the main tabulation centers where people
[2:30:37.880 --> 2:30:39.880]  sending tips
[2:30:39.880 --> 2:30:41.880]  to you guys that are working like Trojans
[2:30:41.880 --> 2:30:43.880]  you know just like around the clock
[2:30:43.880 --> 2:30:45.880]  like Santa's Elves to get all this
[2:30:45.880 --> 2:30:47.880]  out at Project Veritas
[2:30:47.880 --> 2:30:49.880]  again give out that email
[2:30:49.880 --> 2:30:51.880]  one more time James O'Keeffe
[2:30:51.880 --> 2:30:53.880]  it's the Veritas tips at Proton Mail
[2:30:53.880 --> 2:30:55.880]  that's E-E-R-I-T
[2:30:55.880 --> 2:30:57.880]  the tips at protonmail.com
[2:30:57.880 --> 2:30:59.880]  wear a camera, be brave, do something
[2:30:59.880 --> 2:31:01.880]  as time is now I look forward to hearing from your audience
[2:31:01.880 --> 2:31:03.880]  alright thank you so much James O'Keeffe
[2:31:03.880 --> 2:31:05.880]  we salute you go with God
[2:31:05.880 --> 2:31:07.880]  thank you
[2:31:07.880 --> 2:31:09.880]  alright here is the report
[2:31:09.880 --> 2:31:11.880]  just he's got hours of it but here's
[2:31:11.880 --> 2:31:13.880]  just the synopsis we're going to come back
[2:31:13.880 --> 2:31:15.880]  and get into all of the breaking news
[2:31:15.880 --> 2:31:17.880]  I'm just punch drunk at this point
[2:31:17.880 --> 2:31:19.880]  this is insane America is
[2:31:19.880 --> 2:31:21.880]  literally fighting for it's life this is bigger than
[2:31:21.880 --> 2:31:23.880]  World War II
[2:31:23.880 --> 2:31:25.880]  tell us where you work
[2:31:25.880 --> 2:31:27.880]  I work in the Travis City Post Office
[2:31:27.880 --> 2:31:29.880]  more specifically the Artilal Branch
[2:31:29.880 --> 2:31:31.880]  your boss told you and your colleagues something that shocked you this morning
[2:31:31.880 --> 2:31:33.880]  what was it?
[2:31:33.880 --> 2:31:35.880]  we were issued a directive this morning
[2:31:35.880 --> 2:31:37.880]  to collect any ballots we find
[2:31:37.880 --> 2:31:39.880]  in mailboxes, collection boxes
[2:31:39.880 --> 2:31:41.880]  just outgoing mail in general
[2:31:41.880 --> 2:31:43.880]  separate them at the end of the day so that they could
[2:31:43.880 --> 2:31:45.880]  hand stamp them
[2:31:45.880 --> 2:31:47.880]  with the previous day's date
[2:31:47.880 --> 2:31:49.880]  today is November 4th
[2:31:49.880 --> 2:31:51.880]  for clarification who is your boss
[2:31:51.880 --> 2:31:53.880]  what is his title?
[2:31:53.880 --> 2:31:55.880]  Jonathan would be a direct supervisor yes
[2:31:55.880 --> 2:31:57.880]  as of right now he is the opening supervisor
[2:31:57.880 --> 2:31:59.880]  for the Barlow Branch Post Office
[2:31:59.880 --> 2:32:01.880]  so I
[2:32:01.880 --> 2:32:03.880]  and Mrs. Anne
[2:32:03.880 --> 2:32:05.880]  carried you down to another office and they watched the
[2:32:05.880 --> 2:32:07.880]  postmaster doing it
[2:32:07.880 --> 2:32:09.880]  if it were just a typical day
[2:32:09.880 --> 2:32:11.880]  it would be clerks
[2:32:11.880 --> 2:32:13.880]  doing it up at the distribution center
[2:32:13.880 --> 2:32:15.880]  so 8 p.m. election day
[2:32:15.880 --> 2:32:17.880]  November 3rd
[2:32:17.880 --> 2:32:19.880]  the Court of Appeals
[2:32:19.880 --> 2:32:21.880]  ruled ballots have to be received by that time
[2:32:21.880 --> 2:32:23.880]  and what were you told?
[2:32:23.880 --> 2:32:25.880]  to suffer in today's Lake of Markham with yesterday's date
[2:32:25.880 --> 2:32:27.880]  and send them to the express system
[2:32:27.880 --> 2:32:29.880]  to where they needed to go
[2:32:29.880 --> 2:32:31.880]  this appears to be an attempt to circumvent Michigan law
[2:32:31.880 --> 2:32:33.880]  and allow late votes
[2:32:33.880 --> 2:32:35.880]  and you said there was a hamper where letter carriers
[2:32:35.880 --> 2:32:37.880]  were supposed to leave their ballots
[2:32:37.880 --> 2:32:39.880]  where are the ballots now?
[2:32:39.880 --> 2:32:41.880]  they were putting them into express bags
[2:32:41.880 --> 2:32:43.880]  to go to the distribution center
[2:32:43.880 --> 2:32:45.880]  in regards to a hamper
[2:32:45.880 --> 2:32:47.880]  there was a standard hamper that all letter mail was supposed to go to
[2:32:47.880 --> 2:32:49.880]  and they had a Pub next to it that we were supposed to
[2:32:49.880 --> 2:32:51.880]  put in these ballots collected today into
[2:32:51.880 --> 2:32:53.880]  what made you come forward?
[2:32:53.880 --> 2:32:55.880]  that sketchy
[2:32:55.880 --> 2:32:57.880]  I don't like sketchy, it screams corruption
[2:32:57.880 --> 2:32:59.880]  also knowing the Post Office's leanings politically
[2:32:59.880 --> 2:33:01.880]  it didn't seem quite right
[2:33:01.880 --> 2:33:03.880]  what is your message to other postal workers
[2:33:03.880 --> 2:33:05.880]  who see things like this?
[2:33:05.880 --> 2:33:07.880]  report it
[2:33:07.880 --> 2:33:09.880]  how are we supposed to have any integrity
[2:33:09.880 --> 2:33:11.880]  in this country if we
[2:33:11.880 --> 2:33:13.880]  are just going to let things slide based on a
[2:33:13.880 --> 2:33:15.880]  stailing issue
[2:33:15.880 --> 2:33:17.880]  are you afraid of retaliation against you?
[2:33:17.880 --> 2:33:19.880]  I've had whistleblower
[2:33:19.880 --> 2:33:21.880]  policies back far on me in the past
[2:33:21.880 --> 2:33:23.880]  so yes
[2:33:23.880 --> 2:33:25.880]  we'll have to reach out to Jonathan Clark for comment
[2:33:25.880 --> 2:33:27.880]  hey is this Jonathan?
[2:33:27.880 --> 2:33:29.880]  hey I'm a reporter with Project Veritas
[2:33:29.880 --> 2:33:31.880]  James O'Keefe here
[2:33:31.880 --> 2:33:33.880]  and I have information
[2:33:33.880 --> 2:33:35.880]  that you guys have been stamping
[2:33:35.880 --> 2:33:37.880]  ballots with the previous
[2:33:37.880 --> 2:33:39.880]  date, November 3rd
[2:33:39.880 --> 2:33:41.880]  he just hung up
[2:33:41.880 --> 2:33:43.880]  he just hung up the phone on me
[2:33:43.880 --> 2:33:45.880]  election 2020 is here
[2:33:45.880 --> 2:33:47.880]  whether Trump wins or loses
[2:33:47.880 --> 2:33:49.880]  we have all won by exposing the
[2:33:49.880 --> 2:33:51.880]  communist Chinese, by exposing the globalist
[2:33:51.880 --> 2:33:53.880]  by exposing the pedophile rings
[2:33:53.880 --> 2:33:55.880]  by exposing the fact this is really a fight
[2:33:55.880 --> 2:33:57.880]  between good versus evil
[2:33:57.880 --> 2:33:59.880]  I'm personally a Christian
[2:33:59.880 --> 2:34:01.880]  I believe in God and I know God's real
[2:34:01.880 --> 2:34:03.880]  life
[2:34:03.880 --> 2:34:05.880]  it's important to recognize that there is good
[2:34:05.880 --> 2:34:07.880]  in this world, there is evil
[2:34:07.880 --> 2:34:09.880]  there are people out there that want to do you harm
[2:34:09.880 --> 2:34:11.880]  because they enjoy doing that
[2:34:11.880 --> 2:34:13.880]  and what I see happening
[2:34:13.880 --> 2:34:15.880]  across the spectrum
[2:34:15.880 --> 2:34:17.880]  of different political views is people finally
[2:34:17.880 --> 2:34:19.880]  get that, they finally understand
[2:34:19.880 --> 2:34:21.880]  that they're not being naive anymore
[2:34:21.880 --> 2:34:23.880]  don't ever project your decency
[2:34:23.880 --> 2:34:25.880]  and your goodness onto other people
[2:34:25.880 --> 2:34:27.880]  until they've proven
[2:34:27.880 --> 2:34:29.880]  what they stand for and who they are
[2:34:29.880 --> 2:34:31.880]  or you're going to get hurt
[2:34:31.880 --> 2:34:33.880]  but those of you out there that have done your own research
[2:34:33.880 --> 2:34:35.880]  and discovered who's good and who is faithful
[2:34:35.880 --> 2:34:37.880]  will then come together with those organizations
[2:34:37.880 --> 2:34:39.880]  and support them, like InfoWars
[2:34:39.880 --> 2:34:41.880]  because without your support InfoWars
[2:34:41.880 --> 2:34:43.880]  would not exist
[2:34:43.880 --> 2:34:45.880]  it's all on record
[2:34:45.880 --> 2:34:47.880]  Yale, Harvard, Princeton
[2:34:47.880 --> 2:34:49.880]  Stanford, they were all hired
[2:34:49.880 --> 2:34:51.880]  a year ago
[2:34:51.880 --> 2:34:53.880]  and then again six months ago to war game
[2:34:53.880 --> 2:34:55.880]  how to get the public to stay locked
[2:34:55.880 --> 2:34:57.880]  down during a pandemic
[2:34:57.880 --> 2:34:59.880]  and how to get the public to take
[2:34:59.880 --> 2:35:01.880]  inoculations and they talk about calling people
[2:35:01.880 --> 2:35:03.880]  heroes that do it
[2:35:03.880 --> 2:35:05.880]  they talk about shaming those that don't
[2:35:05.880 --> 2:35:07.880]  this has all been psychologically tested
[2:35:07.880 --> 2:35:09.880]  it's all been psychologically prepared
[2:35:09.880 --> 2:35:11.880]  and once they get a lock down for 15 days
[2:35:11.880 --> 2:35:13.880]  you notice now they say it's permanent
[2:35:13.880 --> 2:35:15.880]  that's how it works
[2:35:15.880 --> 2:35:17.880]  oh just put these handcuffs on
[2:35:17.880 --> 2:35:19.880]  the serial killer says the woman
[2:35:19.880 --> 2:35:21.880]  in the parking lot and everything will be alright
[2:35:21.880 --> 2:35:23.880]  no, now we've already put the handcuffs on
[2:35:23.880 --> 2:35:25.880]  and we're in the serial killer's van
[2:35:25.880 --> 2:35:27.880]  he's taking us
[2:35:27.880 --> 2:35:29.880]  to his shack in the woods
[2:35:29.880 --> 2:35:31.880]  to slowly torture us to death
[2:35:31.880 --> 2:35:33.880]  that's the allegory
[2:35:33.880 --> 2:35:35.880]  we've got to bust out of this thing now
[2:35:35.880 --> 2:35:37.880]  we've got to make a run for it now
[2:35:37.880 --> 2:35:39.880]  once he gets us in that basement
[2:35:39.880 --> 2:35:41.880]  it's going to get a lot worse folks
[2:35:41.880 --> 2:35:43.880]  so stop submitting
[2:35:43.880 --> 2:35:45.880]  DNA Force Plus
[2:35:45.880 --> 2:35:47.880]  if you did one thing for your immune system
[2:35:47.880 --> 2:35:49.880]  you would be getting all the essential things
[2:35:49.880 --> 2:35:51.880]  and that's the clean iodine X2 or X3
[2:35:51.880 --> 2:35:53.880]  that's the bio tricillinium
[2:35:53.880 --> 2:35:55.880]  that is the vitamin D3
[2:35:55.880 --> 2:35:57.880]  that is the C, that is the zinc
[2:35:57.880 --> 2:35:59.880]  there's 13 vitamins and minerals that are essential
[2:35:59.880 --> 2:36:01.880]  and studies show you really need the other ones too
[2:36:01.880 --> 2:36:03.880]  but DNA Force goes beyond that
[2:36:03.880 --> 2:36:05.880]  it helps get all that in the cells and out the cells
[2:36:05.880 --> 2:36:07.880]  with PQQ and CoQ10
[2:36:07.880 --> 2:36:09.880]  the highest quality sources

[2:36:11.880 --> 2:36:13.880]  that unclog them so all that stuff can get in
[2:36:13.880 --> 2:36:15.880]  viruses don't get in
[2:36:15.880 --> 2:36:17.880]  the good stuff gets in as the NIH website says
[2:36:17.880 --> 2:36:19.880]  that if you have all the proper things
[2:36:19.880 --> 2:36:21.880]  they can't replicate like they could
[2:36:21.880 --> 2:36:23.880]  like water
[2:36:23.880 --> 2:36:25.880]  DNA Force sold out for months 50% off out of the gates

[2:36:31.880 --> 2:36:33.880]  we had a limited supply and it was very hard to get the PQQ this time
[2:36:33.880 --> 2:36:35.880]  a lot of our stuff can't get anymore
[2:36:35.880 --> 2:36:37.880]  a lot of our products because the supply chain is broken down
[2:36:37.880 --> 2:36:39.880]  that's part of the global's plan

[2:37:21.880 --> 2:37:23.880]  but by taking a little bit of action you can override them
[2:37:23.880 --> 2:37:25.880]  have the app
[2:37:25.880 --> 2:37:27.880]  and then tell others about it so they can get the app

[3:13:05.880 --> 3:13:13.880]  Music
[3:13:13.880 --> 3:13:25.880]  Well, I'll tell you what, it's an amazing time to be here with this big show. I'm so glad I'm so grateful for the opportunity.
[3:13:25.880 --> 3:13:37.880]  We're all right now obviously focused on the election as we should be, but we don't want to just cover the same ground, exactly the same ground over and over again. We're all pretty tuned in.
[3:13:37.880 --> 3:13:47.880]  I'd like to pull the focus out more globally right now and look at this current coup, which is what's going on. I want to look at this current coup from a global perspective.
[3:13:47.880 --> 3:14:01.880]  Right now, there's a guy at the World Economic Forum named Klaus Schwab. He's really just a George Soros sock puppet and mouthpiece. He sounds exactly like Dr. Evil.
[3:14:01.880 --> 3:14:13.880]  This is all part of the great reset. Even a couple months ago, if you talked about the great reset on Facebook or Twitter, you'd get banned for talking about an evil conspiracy theory.
[3:14:13.880 --> 3:14:23.880]  Now they're just coming right out and talking about it. So what is so important about this coup? What is so important about getting Biden into the White House by any means at all?
[3:14:23.880 --> 3:14:37.880]  Even really an obvious, heavy-handed attempt to stuff the ballot boxes in a half-dozen swing states, it's because for this great reset, Trump has to go.
[3:14:37.880 --> 3:14:53.880]  It can't work with Trump blocking their path. They need a compliant, chai-com, globalist, corporate lackey like Joe Biden, an empty vessel, or a willing communist like Samuel Harris.
[3:14:53.880 --> 3:15:09.880]  That's the only way that they can pull off this great reset, which is all based on the timing of the pandemic. They have to do this while people still have the fear up over this pandemic.
[3:15:09.880 --> 3:15:26.880]  That's why they're doing it in such an obvious and an overt way. In fact, this is actually going to work to our benefit, to Trump's benefit, because they've just jumped the shark. They've gone so far beyond what's plausible.
[3:15:26.880 --> 3:15:48.880]  You can do this with an Al Franken in a Senate race here and there, but you can't do this at a presidential level with such obvious coordination from one state to another state, from Pennsylvania to Arizona, from Georgia to Detroit.
[3:15:48.880 --> 3:16:03.880]  And it's so obvious what's going on. When you have hundreds of thousands of ballots showing up at four o'clock in the morning during a convenient timeout when all the observers are supposed to be gone,
[3:16:03.880 --> 3:16:15.880]  thankfully, there were people with cameras watching all of these doors to see the vans roll up and the wagons and the coolers going in with the fake ballots.
[3:16:15.880 --> 3:16:32.880]  And in the next couple segments on the show, I'm going to talk about some of the cheating methods that they use, but one that's going to really blow up in their face is when you have 10,000 ballots show up, and not only are they all for Biden,
[3:16:32.880 --> 3:16:48.880]  but Biden is the only block circle, the only ballot marking is for Biden, not for Senate, not for anybody. That's when they're doing these ballot fraud parties and they're marking them as fast as possible.
[3:16:48.880 --> 3:16:58.880]  Just pull up the corner, hit Biden, pull up the corner, hit Biden. That's how you get so many Biden votes, but when they do a hand recount, which I think it's going to come to it,
[3:16:58.880 --> 3:17:12.880]  Trump is a fighter, he's not a squish, he's not going to roll over. When they go to a manual recount and they have real observers like back in Florida with the hanging chads, when they are looking at every single ballot,
[3:17:12.880 --> 3:17:25.880]  and you see ballot after ballot with nothing filled out except for a Biden circle that they can just run them into the machine full speed, but nothing else is filled out.
[3:17:25.880 --> 3:17:36.880]  The fraud is going to be so obvious, this is going to backfire against the Democrats, and it's going to put Trump back into the White House with more power than ever.
[3:17:36.880 --> 3:17:38.880]  We'll talk about that on the other side.
[3:17:38.880 --> 3:17:56.880]  I once saw a bumper sticker that read, if you want your children to listen to you, whisper, and it's true. A lot of times if somebody's shouting and yelling, even of what they're talking about is important, people tend to tune it out. You know why I know that? Because I'm Alex Jones.
[3:17:56.880 --> 3:18:10.880]  I've been pretty obnoxious over the years because I'm worried about the New World Order, and I read about all their plans to lock down civilization, start the third world, and then enslave the first world. So I've been really, really loud and really, really aggressive,
[3:18:10.880 --> 3:18:26.880]  and we've had a big effect, but now it's time to think about every different angle and every different way we can get people to think for themselves before it's too late. The lockdown, social distancing, the mask is meant to end human civilization.
[3:18:26.880 --> 3:18:41.880]  We are under a civilization collapse weapon, so this is live and death. Please share in FullWars.com and band on video and watch our live election coverage.
[3:18:56.880 --> 3:19:07.880]  All that in the cells and out the cells with PQQ and CoQ10 are the highest quality sources with other ingredients that clean out the cells, that unclog them so all that stuff can get in.
[3:19:07.880 --> 3:19:16.880]  Viruses don't get in. The good stuff gets in, as the NIH website says, that if you have all the proper things, they can't replicate like they could. But I do this because it's essential, like oxygen, like water.
[3:19:16.880 --> 3:19:27.880]  FullWars sold out for months, 50% off out of the gates, triple Patriot points, free shipping, in FullWarsStore.com. DNA Forest election special, that's going to have to end in a week. We've got a limited supply, and it was very hard to get the PQQ this time.
[3:19:27.880 --> 3:19:32.880]  A lot of our stuff can't get any more. A lot of our products, because the supply chain's broken down, that's part of the global's plan.
[3:19:32.880 --> 3:19:47.880]  In FullWarsStore.com or triple 82533139, I want to thank you all for tuning in.
[3:20:02.880 --> 3:20:20.880]  To interfere with the 2020 U.S. elections, remove the populist champion of the people, Donald J. Trump, and install the decrepit, perverted, traitorous establishment puppet, Joe Biden, along with rabid radical hag, Kamala Harris.
[3:20:20.880 --> 3:20:40.880]  Keep your heads on a swivel, and tune in to 79days.news for tomorrow's news today.
[3:20:40.880 --> 3:21:08.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:21:08.880 --> 3:21:20.880]  In the last segment, I was talking about the great reset and why it's so important for the globalists to do anything possible to get Biden put in the White House.
[3:21:20.880 --> 3:21:25.880]  Trump has got to be destroyed. That is the bottom line.
[3:21:25.880 --> 3:21:39.880]  The first book that I wrote 15 years ago now, enemies foreign and domestic. Let me tell you something. Foreign enemies are a problem. Foreign enemies are tough.
[3:21:39.880 --> 3:21:57.880]  But domestic enemies are 100 times harder and worse, because they are embedded right inside of the system, like a cancer. They're woven right into your own glands and lungs and heart.
[3:21:57.880 --> 3:22:12.880]  They're not gone even after almost four years of Trump. They have just dug in. And this is why they're so hard to eradicate. They're the permanent bureaucracy. They're what we call the deep state.
[3:22:12.880 --> 3:22:27.880]  In this segment, I'm going to talk about this coup, and I'm going to compare it to two other historical movements. One is the Valkyrie plot against Hitler in World War II.
[3:22:27.880 --> 3:22:33.880]  We've all seen the Tom Cruise movie. He's not my favorite actor, but it's a good history film.
[3:22:33.880 --> 3:22:44.880]  In that movie, obviously, they're trying to get rid of Hitler, and they have a pretty good plot. They put a bomb in the bunker with him, but it doesn't kill Hitler.
[3:22:44.880 --> 3:22:54.880]  They try to take down the communications and then run their own communications network from Berlin, putting out the news that Hitler is dead and we're now in charge.
[3:22:54.880 --> 3:23:07.880]  And if Hitler had died, maybe it would have worked. But in the midst of this coup, everybody was sitting on the fence. All of the power players were waiting to see which way will it go.
[3:23:07.880 --> 3:23:18.880]  If it looks like Hitler might make a comeback, nobody's going to go to SS headquarters and arrest the SS, or if they do, they're going to quickly leave.
[3:23:18.880 --> 3:23:28.880]  So this is the moment right now in America, in Washington, when power players are waiting to see which way this is going to tilt.
[3:23:28.880 --> 3:23:45.880]  Now, another comparison I will make is to 1991 in Moscow, when the communists tried to do a last-minute coup at the parliament building in Moscow, and Boris Yeltsin got up on the tank.
[3:23:45.880 --> 3:23:55.880]  That's when it was conclusively shown that the Soviet troops were not going to open fire on Russians to keep the communists in power.
[3:23:55.880 --> 3:24:05.880]  Yeltsin got on the tank. The soldiers refused to go against the people. The coup plotters inside of the parliament had to slink away.
[3:24:05.880 --> 3:24:25.880]  This is literally the type of a moment that we are in right now, a Valkyrie moment, a Moscow 1991 moment. This is when the power players, the snakes, are waiting to see, does it look like Trump is going to get through this, or does it look like they're going to be dealing with President Biden?
[3:24:25.880 --> 3:24:38.880]  This is a moment when we should be seeing senators not just blowing their own horn like Lindsey Graham doing his congratulation dance, we should see Lindsey Graham in Pennsylvania.
[3:24:38.880 --> 3:24:50.880]  We should see these guys at the vote, not just some unknown congressman, we should be seeing senators demanding to get in to watch the recount.
[3:24:50.880 --> 3:25:06.880]  This is a moment where we're in the middle of a power play. It's great that Trump supporters are outside of all of these ballot counting facilities, but if they can't get in to watch it, we may never know what happened.
[3:25:06.880 --> 3:25:21.880]  And if the Supreme Court punts again and doesn't hear the case, Biden is going to win. So we're in that moment where everybody is just waiting for the wind. Is it going to come from the north or the south? Will it be cold or hot?
[3:25:21.880 --> 3:25:30.880]  Which way am I going to trim my sails so that I can still be in a power position regardless of who is president next year?
[3:25:30.880 --> 3:25:40.880]  Now is the time when courageous people will make their mark on history like Yeltsin climbing up on the tank.
[3:25:40.880 --> 3:25:56.880]  If they don't, if these Republican senators hide under their desks during this moment of truth and don't get out in front of the Trump crowds, then they're just, I don't know what to say about them, it's extremely cowardly.
[3:25:56.880 --> 3:26:05.880]  We need some Boris Yeltsin courage here. We need them to go to these counting facilities in each of these disputed states.
[3:26:05.880 --> 3:26:29.880]  Otherwise, you can bet, Brennan, Comey, Clapper, they're watching minute by minute, just like an Operation Valkyrie coup or a Yeltsin Moscow coup. These power players are just smugly waiting, thinking, couple more electoral votes, we declare victory, and that's it.
[3:26:29.880 --> 3:26:38.880]  We're back in power. It won't be Brennan, it'll be Gina Haspel who it might as well be Brennan. Haspel is Brennan's puppet.
[3:26:38.880 --> 3:26:51.880]  So the same evil people that Trump partially expelled are going to be fully back in power if this coup goes through. And that's exactly what it is. It's a coup.
[3:26:51.880 --> 3:27:01.880]  And we need some courage now. I love seeing all of the Trump people out waving flags and trying to bang on doors where they can, taking pictures of everything.
[3:27:01.880 --> 3:27:11.880]  Like James O'Keefe said last hour, everybody needs to be a news reporter. Everybody needs to be filming everything 24 hours a day.
[3:27:11.880 --> 3:27:25.880]  We can't count on the Supreme Court to save us. Barrett might recuse herself. Roberts will vote with the Democrats. And that's it. Biden wins, short of an absolute shooting civil war.
[3:27:25.880 --> 3:27:35.880]  Biden will win. The deep state will be completely triumphant. We'll never see the Durham report. It'll be down the memory hole.
[3:27:35.880 --> 3:27:46.880]  We'll see. All of the worst things that Kamala Harris and Biden want to do, they'll try. I don't even take it for granted that we're going to keep the Senate.
[3:27:46.880 --> 3:28:02.880]  I keep hearing how we're holding on to the Senate. But then I see the numbers and it looks like 48 and 48. If they can pull Biden through, don't be surprised if they somehow pull out the same kind of shenanigans to get a couple more Senators,
[3:28:02.880 --> 3:28:17.880]  Democrat Senators, if they have 50 Senators plus Kamala Harris, they can pack the Supreme Court. They can make states out of D.C. and Puerto Rico. That's the Venezuela plan.
[3:28:17.880 --> 3:28:33.880]  Remember, in Venezuela, the first time that Hugo Chavez was elected, conservatives thought, don't worry, the next election, they'll be so unpopular, we'll win in a landslide. But they packed the Supreme Court and there wasn't another fair election.
[3:28:33.880 --> 3:28:48.880]  So don't count on holding the Senate. Don't count on somehow Trump weaving his way through. You can't plan on a hope. That's what they say in the military. Hope is not a plan.
[3:28:48.880 --> 3:29:03.880]  You need to be proactive and very positive. And this is, it's not enough even for just ordinary citizens and Twitter people and bloggers that are doing great work and I'm watching them. I'm following them.
[3:29:03.880 --> 3:29:21.880]  But we need some Senators, some people at that level. And I also wonder where is Trump? You know, he's tweeting. Maybe his advisors are telling him to lay low. I'm not sure about the optics of it. You know, whether it'll be better or worse if he comes out.
[3:29:21.880 --> 3:29:38.880]  It might be time for Trump himself to do a Boris Yeltsin moment and go up to Pennsylvania with the phalanx of the U.S. Marshals and say, I want to see what's going on. I mean, I'm sure that people are thinking in these terms, maybe that would be bad optics.
[3:29:38.880 --> 3:29:51.880]  But certainly there are Republican Senators that are currently hiding under their desks, like the cowards during Operation Valkyrie, you know, who are waiting to see which way the coup is going to go.
[3:29:51.880 --> 3:30:01.880]  Now's the time for people that are brave to stand up and be counted. Otherwise, we're going to wake up, you know, in a Biden world and I'm not counting on keeping the Senate.
[3:30:01.880 --> 3:30:11.880]  I think we're being gaslighted with all this talk about, don't worry, at least we have the Senate. You know, we've even lost Fox News. That's obvious now.
[3:30:11.880 --> 3:30:21.880]  Outside of Tucker Carlson and a couple of the nighttime people, Fox has gone over to the dark side. We saw that on election night with them calling Arizona.
[3:30:21.880 --> 3:30:32.880]  You know, that was completely Fox going to the dark side. So we're watching the commo channels being shut down just like in a coup. And we'll continue this on the other side of the break.
[3:30:52.880 --> 3:31:02.880]  Since then, Prince Charles and countless others have come out and said the exact same thing. The most ancient form of total war is called siege.
[3:31:02.880 --> 3:31:12.880]  And that's when you cut people off from their resources. That's when you lock them down. And this isn't siege to make us capitulate to the globalist or just get rid of Donald Trump.
[3:31:12.880 --> 3:31:25.880]  This is part of it. This is siege to literally train us to be poor and to get us into deep debt. So then the globalist social engineers can dictate how we live our lives with the social credit score surveillance threat.
[3:31:25.880 --> 3:31:33.880]  So you've heard the U.S. Army saying our job is to kill people and break things. Well, that's what the lockdown's doing. It's starving the third world, millions and millions of debt.
[3:31:33.880 --> 3:31:36.880]  It's breaking down the supply chain in society. It's their mission.
[3:31:36.880 --> 3:31:42.880]  I get asked all the time by listeners and by the media, what am I most proud of when it comes to the show?
[3:31:42.880 --> 3:31:49.880]  And it's the fact that info wars more than 25 years ago, doing basic research with what the club of Rome and the CFR and others were actually saying,
[3:31:49.880 --> 3:31:59.880]  developed the hypothesis that the communist China had been set up to take our jobs and transfer them to China and then make us economically destitute and position us into debt.
[3:31:59.880 --> 3:32:07.880]  Well, now China owns the debt. Now China owns Hollywood, all the one side of trading deals. It turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on.
[3:32:07.880 --> 3:32:11.880]  But again, it wasn't that hard. The CFR and others admitted what they were doing.
[3:32:11.880 --> 3:32:19.880]  But still others didn't want to focus on that issue. We did. And you focused on it by supporting us and info wars.
[3:32:19.880 --> 3:32:25.880]  So when you go to info wars store.com and get all the great supplements, books, t-shirts, films, water filtration, air filtration, all of it,
[3:32:25.880 --> 3:32:30.880]  you're funding the organization that literally helped make up the world what's really happening.
[3:32:30.880 --> 3:32:56.880]  So that's a big accomplishment for all of you. I want to thank you for your support.
[3:32:56.880 --> 3:33:03.880]  I know why. Well, with modern science, we know it's one of the purest, cleanest, organic forms of selenium.
[3:33:03.880 --> 3:33:15.880]  We have bio true selenium sold out for months back in stock at info wars store.com at 50% off store ride free shipping and triple patriot points.
[3:33:15.880 --> 3:33:24.880]  Bio true selenium at info wars store.com is an amazing product and it's even more amazing in that it funds our operation.
[3:33:24.880 --> 3:33:31.880]  But if you don't know about selenium research, it is an essential nutrient in the body that you actually have to have.
[3:33:31.880 --> 3:33:55.880]  It was in the telecommunications act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your GPS location.
[3:33:55.880 --> 3:34:02.880]  Don't just track your location, but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk to, your relationships,
[3:34:02.880 --> 3:34:10.880]  and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well, including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying,
[3:34:10.880 --> 3:34:19.880]  just like Siri or Alexa do and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever.
[3:34:19.880 --> 3:34:24.880]  Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based on information.
[3:34:24.880 --> 3:34:31.880]  This is the global Chinese communist social credit score. Get your protection privacy pockets at infowarstore.com
[3:34:31.880 --> 3:34:34.880]  and cut Big Brother off dead in his filthy tracks.
[3:34:34.880 --> 3:34:59.880]  infowarstore.com
[3:34:59.880 --> 3:35:06.880]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[3:35:06.880 --> 3:35:16.880]  And now it's time to do or die.
[3:35:16.880 --> 3:35:24.880]  We can't hope that the Supreme Court is going to save us. We can't hope that we keep the Senate.
[3:35:24.880 --> 3:35:29.880]  We have to push through this coup. We can't say, oh, it's all right if Biden wins.
[3:35:29.880 --> 3:35:36.880]  We have to take it like take the loss like gentlemen. That's the old sucker loser Rhino Republicans.
[3:35:36.880 --> 3:35:43.880]  You know, they want to still be invited to the parties, so they'd rather lose with grace than fight.
[3:35:43.880 --> 3:35:50.880]  We are in a street fight now. One of the hallmarks of a coup is shutting down the communications.
[3:35:50.880 --> 3:35:57.880]  When you see the president of the United States have his tweets blocked so that they can't be shared.
[3:35:57.880 --> 3:36:02.880]  You can see it, but you can't share it and you can't comment on it.
[3:36:02.880 --> 3:36:08.880]  This is censorship. When you see all of the mainstream media out other than Fox,
[3:36:08.880 --> 3:36:12.880]  didn't report on Tony Bobolinsky two weeks before the election.
[3:36:12.880 --> 3:36:22.880]  The laptop story plus the Tony Bobolinsky information proves that the Bidens are sold out to the Chinese communists.
[3:36:22.880 --> 3:36:31.880]  The entire media world never said the word Tony Bobolinsky. This is Soviet level propaganda.
[3:36:31.880 --> 3:36:38.880]  Now Fox has joined this. They've got out of all the networks in a way they're the worst.
[3:36:38.880 --> 3:36:46.880]  They've got the Arizona firmly in the Biden category and they did that election night
[3:36:46.880 --> 3:36:54.880]  with something like 15% of the votes in based on nothing more than mystery polling.
[3:36:54.880 --> 3:37:01.880]  And when you dig down and find out who was it that was behind that calling of Arizona,
[3:37:01.880 --> 3:37:06.880]  Fox has put some real never Trumpers into positions of authority.
[3:37:06.880 --> 3:37:11.880]  You know, I love Donald Trump, but he has some character flaws that have hurt him.
[3:37:11.880 --> 3:37:18.880]  And one of them is going on personal attacks when it's really just going to boomerang on him.
[3:37:18.880 --> 3:37:25.880]  The other last week he went on Fox and Friends in the morning and he really, he really dissed Fox and they deserve it.
[3:37:25.880 --> 3:37:30.880]  Okay, as you know, saying that Tucker, you're great. The Fox and Friends are great.
[3:37:30.880 --> 3:37:34.880]  But the daytime programming, the weekend programming might as well be CNN.
[3:37:34.880 --> 3:37:42.880]  I think the Murdoch family took that as a real insult and basically declared war on Fox.
[3:37:42.880 --> 3:37:45.880]  Or excuse me, Fox declared war on Trump.
[3:37:45.880 --> 3:37:52.880]  The night of the election, I was watching most of the regulars, the Katie Pobliges, these type of people.
[3:37:52.880 --> 3:37:56.880]  They looked like they were blinking out torture, like they couldn't believe it.
[3:37:56.880 --> 3:38:01.880]  Like did I wake up in an alternate universe on CNN or MSNBC?
[3:38:01.880 --> 3:38:08.880]  Now these guys make a million a year, millions a year. The contributors, the anchors make tens of millions a year.
[3:38:08.880 --> 3:38:12.880]  They don't want to lose that, you know, that rice ball, obviously.
[3:38:12.880 --> 3:38:20.880]  But I'm waiting to see if Tucker's going to walk because I don't see him going for this Fox turning into CNN business.
[3:38:20.880 --> 3:38:22.880]  But that's clearly what's happening.
[3:38:22.880 --> 3:38:28.880]  And when you see this type of censorship, you know you've got to migrate off of big social media.
[3:38:28.880 --> 3:38:33.880]  Twitter and Facebook are enemy territory. They have a share button.
[3:38:33.880 --> 3:38:37.880]  They want you as a sucker to use the Facebook share button.
[3:38:37.880 --> 3:38:44.880]  If you're a conservative and you're sharing a link to a conservative subject, you just went down the memory hole.
[3:38:44.880 --> 3:38:49.880]  You're like a rabbit in a cage, you know, getting a pellet thinking you're going to escape.
[3:38:49.880 --> 3:38:55.880]  You're not going to escape. It's just a positive feedback loop to make you a happy little, you know, slave.
[3:38:55.880 --> 3:38:59.880]  You've got to get on to alternate social media.
[3:38:59.880 --> 3:39:04.880]  I mean, there's minds and me, we personally, I like Gab and Parler a lot better.
[3:39:04.880 --> 3:39:10.880]  They're not quite as slick as Facebook and Twitter. They don't have their budget. I get it.
[3:39:10.880 --> 3:39:14.880]  But you don't want to ride on the fancy slave bus.
[3:39:14.880 --> 3:39:23.880]  Yeah, there's an on air conditioned, you know, 1950s roll up the window with a crank, you know, truck down the street, but it's free.
[3:39:23.880 --> 3:39:29.880]  You can say what you want. Get off the fancy air conditioned slave bus.
[3:39:29.880 --> 3:39:33.880]  Is your convenience that important to you?
[3:39:33.880 --> 3:39:37.880]  I mean, this is really an important moment in our history.
[3:39:37.880 --> 3:39:42.880]  And it's not just whether the Republicans or the Democrats are going to win,
[3:39:42.880 --> 3:39:48.880]  whether Biden gets in and controls the Senate, because I don't think that's a sure thing that we keep it.
[3:39:48.880 --> 3:39:54.880]  I think that's like a that's like a little bit of sugar on the spoon to get us to swallow Biden.
[3:39:54.880 --> 3:39:58.880]  Don't worry, we've got the Senate. We might wake up and we don't have the Senate.
[3:39:58.880 --> 3:40:00.880]  We have to fight for Trump now.
[3:40:00.880 --> 3:40:10.880]  Like it's like there is no tomorrow because if Biden wins and they somehow slime their way to getting 50 senators, there won't be a tomorrow.
[3:40:10.880 --> 3:40:15.880]  Ask the Venezuelans who thought they would just lose one election to Hugo Chavez.
[3:40:15.880 --> 3:40:20.880]  Once they pack the Supreme Court, it's done. They nail the door shut.
[3:40:20.880 --> 3:40:24.880]  Now, we're not Venezuela in a way because we're way better armed.
[3:40:24.880 --> 3:40:35.880]  And something else, something important to look at this is that it's not just whether the Republicans or the Democrats will be in charge of the country.
[3:40:35.880 --> 3:40:40.880]  And Tifa would like to use this moment. They've been talking about it for, you know, for months.
[3:40:40.880 --> 3:40:50.880]  They would like to use this moment to pour gasoline on the fire as much as possible and ramp this thing up into a full blown civil war.
[3:40:50.880 --> 3:40:55.880]  The worse, the better. They don't care if they don't like Biden. You've seen their banners.
[3:40:55.880 --> 3:40:58.880]  They hate Biden practically as much as they hate Trump.
[3:40:58.880 --> 3:41:04.880]  They just consider our entire system to be an evil Nazi fascist system.
[3:41:04.880 --> 3:41:07.880]  They want to blow the whole thing up.
[3:41:07.880 --> 3:41:21.880]  So this is a moment when they're going to probably begin to confront the patriots outside of the polling centers and get into, you know, some street battles, like, you know, 1930s Germany style street battles.
[3:41:21.880 --> 3:41:25.880]  So we have to be, you know, aware of this and ready for this.
[3:41:25.880 --> 3:41:46.880]  This is also a time when there's a maximum danger of either a false flag or some other type of a terror attack that is going to elevate this from simply being an argument about vote fraud into an argument about right wing terrorism.
[3:41:46.880 --> 3:41:59.880]  So that the media can, as we're starting to control the narrative about voter fraud, they're going to say, hey, desperate times calls for desperate measures, time to kick it up another notch.
[3:41:59.880 --> 3:42:08.880]  And that means let's go from the vote fraud story, which is getting traction and throw this into a right wing terror equation.
[3:42:08.880 --> 3:42:11.880]  And there's nothing easier than a false flag.
[3:42:11.880 --> 3:42:13.880]  This is something that's been used throughout history.
[3:42:13.880 --> 3:42:30.880]  And the socialists, whether they're communist international socialists or national socialists, they always use false flags so that they can massage the narrative and blame an atrocity on an enemy so that you can make the next move.
[3:42:30.880 --> 3:42:32.880]  We're in a very, very dangerous time.
[3:42:32.880 --> 3:42:40.880]  You know, this is absolutely no load like hoping we just can slide through it easily.
[3:42:40.880 --> 3:42:52.880]  This is going to take a lot of courage because, you know, we, I think that the Patriots side caught Antifa and BLM off their game just today and got out in front at the polling centers.
[3:42:52.880 --> 3:42:54.880]  Don't expect that to last.
[3:42:54.880 --> 3:42:58.880]  You know, that's going to be an around the clock thing now.
[3:42:58.880 --> 3:43:13.880]  Some of this will be a question of who's willing to stay out there 24 hours a day to film the ballots coming in, you know, to get the good corner positions on the streets to keep Antifa from occupying them.
[3:43:13.880 --> 3:43:26.880]  If the Patriots all go home when it's, you know, 5pm so that they can get dinner and, you know, have a nice night in bed, they're going to come back the next day and it's going to be all black block around the voting centers.
[3:43:26.880 --> 3:43:34.880]  And their signs are going to say count every vote and you won't see another Patriot, you know, talking about vote fraud.
[3:43:34.880 --> 3:43:36.880]  It's going to completely shift.
[3:43:36.880 --> 3:43:38.880]  But this is our moment.
[3:43:38.880 --> 3:43:40.880]  This is our Moscow 1991.
[3:43:40.880 --> 3:43:42.880]  I cannot emphasize that enough.
[3:43:42.880 --> 3:43:45.880]  This is the time when we have to make the big push.
[3:43:45.880 --> 3:43:51.880]  If we don't, if we lay down and take it, if we just think, well, what can I do?
[3:43:51.880 --> 3:43:53.880]  I'm just one person.
[3:43:53.880 --> 3:43:56.880]  We're going to wake up and it's not going to be a free country.
[3:43:56.880 --> 3:43:58.880]  You know, yeah, it won't.
[3:43:58.880 --> 3:44:02.880]  We can probably get through it if we hold the Senate, even if Biden is installed.
[3:44:02.880 --> 3:44:04.880]  He'll be a lame duck from day one.
[3:44:04.880 --> 3:44:11.880]  But Biden's going to be gone by Easter in any case, either over the corruption or the dementia.
[3:44:11.880 --> 3:44:21.880]  So we're going to be talking about President Kamala Harris with at least, you know, four years in office to do the most damage possible to this country.
[3:44:21.880 --> 3:44:28.880]  And remember, the communists don't want to turn our country necessarily into a communist utopia.
[3:44:28.880 --> 3:44:29.880]  It never is.
[3:44:29.880 --> 3:44:33.880]  It always winds up like Cuba, Venezuela or North Korea.
[3:44:33.880 --> 3:44:37.880]  What they really want to do is wreck America.
[3:44:37.880 --> 3:44:50.880]  Just blow it up because America is the last bastion standing in the way of the synthesis of communism and corporatism that we know as globalism now.
[3:44:50.880 --> 3:44:53.880]  America is the last bastion.
[3:44:53.880 --> 3:44:56.880]  Trump is the last hero.
[3:44:56.880 --> 3:44:57.880]  This is it.
[3:44:57.880 --> 3:45:01.880]  If we don't fight for it now, we're going to lose it.
[3:45:01.880 --> 3:45:08.880]  There's no, like, Valkyrie Part II a month after because the plotters are all gone.
[3:45:08.880 --> 3:45:09.880]  They're wiped out.
[3:45:09.880 --> 3:45:18.880]  You know, if Yeltsin hadn't gotten on the tank, we still might be dealing with communist Russia, communist Soviet Union.
[3:45:18.880 --> 3:45:25.880]  So now's the time we've got to get out and fight for Trump like we never fought before, right?
