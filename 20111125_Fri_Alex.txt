[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:27.000]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones we're live ladies and gentlemen
[00:27.000 --> 00:35.800]  I'm in studio back in central Texas it is Friday 25th day of November 2011 and we're
[00:35.800 --> 00:41.000]  going to be live here for the next three hours we're gonna have one of our in-house
[00:41.000 --> 00:45.440]  reporters and researchers and Ron Paul activist Richard Reeves in studio an hour and a half
[00:45.440 --> 00:50.760]  from now about 10 15 minutes to talk about the fact that Ron Paul surging into number
[00:50.760 --> 00:55.960]  one or number two place in every major poll but the media continues to try to ignore that
[00:55.960 --> 01:02.880]  so-called media and some strategies that can hopefully make sure he wins Iowa the Iowa caucus
[01:02.880 --> 01:08.560]  because that's an old-fashioned raise your hand type situation very hard for the establishment
[01:08.560 --> 01:16.240]  criminals to steal that so we are going to be breaking all of that down today of course
[01:16.240 --> 01:19.920]  we didn't have him on last Friday so we'll have a lot to talk about Bob Chapman on the
[01:19.920 --> 01:26.240]  MF global the euro controlled meltdown and more it's all coming up we have the normal
[01:26.240 --> 01:32.440]  beatings and pepper springs and attacks as people run around savagely trying to get discounts
[01:32.440 --> 01:38.760]  on Chinese slave goods deindustrialization goods on black Friday I'd like to hear your
[01:38.760 --> 01:43.520]  black Friday stories all I know is there's a lot of a lot more traffic and people running
[01:43.520 --> 01:50.480]  around like fools trying to get big discounts so we'll be breaking that down today also
[01:50.480 --> 01:57.000]  I'm sorry it was 400 million and 600 700 million then a billion then at 1.2 billion then more
[01:57.000 --> 02:07.600]  than 1.2 billion now there's 3 billion missing according to Reuters from MF global and it's
[02:07.600 --> 02:12.600]  people's private accounts and nobody's going to get in trouble because this is the new system
[02:12.600 --> 02:19.200]  where they take everything and after all it's not black Friday it's not UT versus A&M last
[02:19.200 --> 02:27.240]  night so why does it even matter it it it doesn't matter if we have an economy got something
[02:27.240 --> 02:32.000]  in my eye that was for talking about about UT I got something in my eye I had family
[02:32.000 --> 02:37.720]  over Thanksgiving last night and sure it was it was a good game to sit there and watch
[02:37.720 --> 02:45.040]  simulated combat one team soldiers running out of the pit as gladiators the others running
[02:45.040 --> 02:52.320]  out and all the different generals on the sidelines and and and the young maidens and
[02:52.320 --> 03:00.680]  waiting cheering them on all of it archetypal iconography all a simulation of manhood and
[03:00.680 --> 03:10.200]  tribal war a gilded castrated population devoid of thought or freedom or liberty replacing
[03:10.200 --> 03:19.760]  it all the poison culture poison food poison water poison souls are rotting corpses of
[03:19.760 --> 03:28.840]  a society who believes there's nothing more wholesome wholesome than empty tyranny so
[03:28.840 --> 03:38.400]  that is all coming up today we also have an interesting little tidbit here Tokyo electric
[03:38.400 --> 03:46.720]  power is is is following what Monsanto has said in court that when Monsanto plants a
[03:46.720 --> 03:56.240]  crop that infects your crops not only do they not have liability you have the liability
[03:56.240 --> 04:02.040]  you have trespassed on them even though they trespassed on you and why because they say
[04:02.040 --> 04:07.760]  so just like our media says torture is good and open borders is good and people that don't
[04:07.760 --> 04:12.400]  like world government are bad because world government exists but it also doesn't exist
[04:12.400 --> 04:19.200]  when the media so so well now they're saying that they don't have liability for radiation
[04:19.200 --> 04:25.920]  release from their reactors on your property or even spent fuel rods that blasted up to
[04:25.920 --> 04:32.800]  two miles away on other people's property in fact you now own it and you're radiating
[04:32.800 --> 04:40.160]  everyone and you're liable and the courts of course are ruling absolutely if fuel rods
[04:40.160 --> 04:48.080]  shot onto your property you're bad and because they said so don't be a conspiracy theorist
[04:48.080 --> 04:54.880]  accept it accept it and top people in England are saying basically that pedophile should
[04:54.880 --> 04:59.120]  be able to take care of children yes I'm not kidding that's coming up as well they're right
[04:59.120 --> 05:00.240]  back

[08:15.280 --> 08:21.840]  at home base at central texas deep in the heart of texas austin we're going to be live on the air
[08:21.840 --> 08:26.240]  here for at least the next three hours and of course there's info wars nightly news this evening
[08:26.240 --> 08:31.280]  seven o'clock i want to give the number out here in a moment to talk about any issue you wish to
[08:31.280 --> 08:36.080]  discuss but first i do want to mention just some of the news that's going to be coming up throughout
[08:36.080 --> 08:43.600]  the broadcast today but i've literally probably got more than 200 articles here in front of me and a
[08:43.600 --> 08:49.040]  lot of this i've read over some of this i haven't even gotten to yet i was looking up on screen
[08:49.040 --> 08:54.480]  about a minute before we went into this segment and i saw on info wars dot com and prison planet
[08:54.480 --> 09:02.080]  dot com the headline green debacle tens of thousands of abandoned wind turbines now litter
[09:02.080 --> 09:08.240]  american landscape and it's funny because i have footage of this driving out west i drove
[09:08.800 --> 09:17.680]  ur new mexico into arizona and then into southern utah and then back and all along the way in texas
[09:17.680 --> 09:25.200]  and other states i would see wind turbines the big giant ones off on the horizon not turning
[09:25.760 --> 09:31.440]  even when there was wind and then i'd drive a few more miles and see wind turbines that were
[09:31.440 --> 09:37.440]  turning when there was wind some days such high wind the rv was almost blowing off the run about
[09:37.440 --> 09:43.920]  like 50 mile an hour winds and then i was going to do some investigating into this when i got back
[09:43.920 --> 09:48.880]  and i shot some footage of it i was going to do a nightly news report but wallah november 24th
[09:48.880 --> 09:55.280]  yesterday thanksgiving natural news jonathan benson green debacle tens of thousands of
[09:55.280 --> 10:05.680]  abandoned wind turbines now litter american landscape and it says that 14 000 of them more
[10:05.680 --> 10:10.160]  than that has links to all the government documents have been abandoned because it was
[10:10.160 --> 10:15.280]  government programs they would just build them not even serve with them get the government handout
[10:16.240 --> 10:21.760]  that's why in spain they said it took at least two jobs on top of the money it cost away from
[10:21.760 --> 10:26.880]  the economy to build a wind turbine and then they never can transfer the power properly
[10:26.880 --> 10:30.720]  you need to build power plants near cities because you lose a lot of the power as you
[10:30.720 --> 10:36.640]  transmit it down the major lines so they got these in england and europe and the united states
[10:36.640 --> 10:40.560]  and canada way off the middle of nowhere on mountain ridges and then they're supposed to
[10:40.560 --> 10:45.920]  or on the texas coast and i've seen them sitting idle on the texas coast because it's just like
[10:45.920 --> 10:50.960]  all these other big energy companies where they build green buildings and then just never even
[10:50.960 --> 10:56.880]  hire anybody it's just all a big scam all a big insider deal where al gore and the rothschilds
[10:56.880 --> 11:02.560]  and rockfellers and clinton and obama are all heavily invested it's a bunch of gangsters
[11:02.560 --> 11:08.800]  literally beacons of the green energy movement giant wind turbines have been one of the renewable
[11:08.800 --> 11:13.280]  energy sources of choice for the u.s. government which has spent billions of taxpayer dollars
[11:13.280 --> 11:18.720]  subsidizing the construction and use across the country but high maintenance cost high rates of
[11:18.720 --> 11:23.440]  failure and fluctuating weather conditions that affect energy production render wind turbines
[11:23.440 --> 11:29.200]  expensive and efficient which is why more than 14 000 of them are more have since been abandoned
[11:29.200 --> 11:33.440]  and then it goes through all of it now again here's my frustration if you're watching on
[11:33.440 --> 11:38.480]  prismplanet.tv give me a document cam shot no exaggeration i bet if i count these articles
[11:39.280 --> 11:46.640]  there are more than 200 of them on my desk and each one is more insane than the next i mean
[11:46.640 --> 11:52.400]  look at this one sex offenders including pedophiles should be allowed to adopt top advisors to the
[11:52.400 --> 11:59.200]  government are saying in england i mean you can't make that up uh the the tokyo electric is saying
[11:59.200 --> 12:04.000]  it's your fault if their radiation got on your property and that you're basically trespassing
[12:04.000 --> 12:12.400]  on their radiation can't that's out of mainstream news in in in japan cannot make it up bonkers
[12:12.400 --> 12:22.080]  cuckoo nutcase but the judges in japan and here are all under globalist system it's all standardized
[12:22.080 --> 12:27.920]  and they they're gonna just like monsanto infects your crops you have proof you bought your non-gmo
[12:27.920 --> 12:33.680]  seeds they infect your crops they find one percent of their genetics in your crops and then they
[12:33.680 --> 12:39.440]  sue you for them contaminating you this would be like if if if i broke in your house while you
[12:39.440 --> 12:44.160]  were out of town for a month and put 10 dogs in there to go to the bathroom all over the floor
[12:45.600 --> 12:50.320]  and i fed them 100 gallons of hamburger helper and and you come back home and there's just
[12:50.320 --> 12:58.720]  urine and feces all a knee deep and then and then i sue you for trespassing against me when i broke
[12:58.720 --> 13:04.320]  in your house and put your 20 30 50 100 dogs in there force feeding them hamburger meat
[13:06.880 --> 13:11.120]  except that's just something that screws your house up you got to clean up this is genetic
[13:11.120 --> 13:17.120]  garbage designed to sterilize us and give us cancer in all the documents on all just type in gmo
[13:17.120 --> 13:22.080]  link to cancer burton effect you'll just have hundreds of studies out the wazoo going back 30 years
[13:24.160 --> 13:28.080]  and here they say tepco radioactive substances belong to landowners not us
[13:28.080 --> 13:34.480]  we actually read the full article they're spinning it during court proceedings concerning a radioactive
[13:34.480 --> 13:41.200]  golf course tokyo electric power stunned lawyers by saying the utility was not responsible for
[13:41.200 --> 13:47.360]  decontamination because it no longer owned the radioactive substances you know under common law
[13:47.360 --> 13:53.600]  it goes back to the bible if your ox gets out and gores somebody your your your big work cow your
[13:53.600 --> 13:59.440]  cow that pulls trailers gets out and and and runs over somebody's kid could and kills them
[14:00.080 --> 14:05.760]  off your property you are 100 responsible and it's like that in every culture they just say no no
[14:05.760 --> 14:12.400]  and my ox jumped out of the pen and uh got mad and and and ran over and killed your wife or
[14:12.400 --> 14:18.240]  husband or child whatever we just don't but then they go further and they're saying now you're
[14:18.240 --> 14:23.200]  going to have to clean it up and you've got the liability so so it's not even as bad it's totally
[14:23.200 --> 14:30.640]  insane it goes against logic but official media said so governments you mean corporations it's
[14:30.640 --> 14:33.920]  not as bad as montana's because because then you know they actually come in and then so you
[14:33.920 --> 14:42.640]  stolen their property but it's it's pretty darn close oh here's another one aclu senators demand
[14:42.640 --> 14:49.520]  military lockup for americans in battlefield to find us outside your window and yes the new
[14:49.520 --> 14:54.160]  battlefields for killing americans without courts arresting americans the military
[14:54.160 --> 14:57.760]  tribunals is anywhere in the u.s anywhere in the world
[14:57.760 --> 15:04.560]  and that americans can be arrested and held without charge or trial just the complete
[15:04.560 --> 15:10.960]  martial law i've got that report and it's got quotes from ron paul in here but hey does the
[15:10.960 --> 15:18.640]  average american care about this average american concerned about that no no the average american
[15:18.640 --> 15:25.280]  is concerned about getting a discount and i guess getting their paycheck and and getting out and
[15:25.280 --> 15:30.000]  buying some chinese slave goods that break the first time you get it out of the box on average
[15:30.960 --> 15:36.080]  that they're obsessed with with with with running out and and getting into deeper debt or whatever
[15:36.080 --> 15:41.120]  the case is they're not worried about cancer tripling and diabetes tripling in the last
[15:41.120 --> 15:47.600]  few decades they're not worried about all the new wars they're not worried about the hypocrisy
[15:47.600 --> 15:54.560]  the arab league meeting in cairo while western back military system machine guns crowds and
[15:54.560 --> 16:02.960]  and puts in syria law they're meeting there to discuss human rights abuses in syria that if they
[16:02.960 --> 16:09.200]  are going on or minimal compared to to to egypt not worried about that the arab league is there
[16:09.200 --> 16:13.680]  saying yes we need we want military action in the russians about warships off the coast
[16:13.680 --> 16:18.160]  to defend and then the united states is going to aircraft carrier they're getting ready to put a
[16:18.160 --> 16:25.040]  peaceful member those non-military uh no fly zone that means bombing the whole country and then when
[16:25.040 --> 16:30.720]  they put the al-qaeda rebels in as they did in libya uh literally flying the al-qaeda flag they'll
[16:30.720 --> 16:37.520]  call it humanitarian humanitarian
[16:41.200 --> 16:46.560]  it's humanitarian that they've got 7 000 people at least admitted in a concentration camps and
[16:46.560 --> 16:53.920]  they're systematically murdering people more than 40 000 no it's peaceful and humanitarian
[16:55.760 --> 17:01.040]  but this is happening i mean i'm living in 1984 and there's all these news articles i've got about
[17:01.040 --> 17:07.600]  where the government's openly calling for censorship of talk radio demonizing yours truly for influencing
[17:07.600 --> 17:18.080]  the white house shooter who thought he was jesus uh they're really gearing up to take everything
[17:18.080 --> 17:22.320]  i sat there with family last night at my house for thanksgiving like we had it at my house it was
[17:22.320 --> 17:32.640]  fun and i even enjoyed watching the football game uh two seconds left ut feel gold oh a movie finish
[17:32.640 --> 17:39.360]  a photo finish and i sat there and i watched people having a tribal victory of satisfaction
[17:39.360 --> 17:49.840]  that ut had defeated the the the a and m hordes festooned in their military regalia but the
[17:49.840 --> 17:54.560]  neural order was still there the gmoing of the food was still there the cancer viruses and the
[17:54.560 --> 18:01.840]  vaccine was still there and i knew all the archetypes the the the the home team's army
[18:01.840 --> 18:07.120]  running out of the gladiatorial underground base out to face the enemy the young maidens
[18:07.760 --> 18:13.040]  out there presenting themselves for the warriors the maidens will be handed to the young men that
[18:13.040 --> 18:18.720]  defeat the foreign tribe that's one tribe on one side the other tribe on the other
[18:18.720 --> 18:25.920]  university of texas in the enemy's camp behind enemy lines all of its systematic social engineering
[18:25.920 --> 18:32.640]  art type of iconography total programming intermixed with advertisements and brainwashing and
[18:34.240 --> 18:41.600]  all the rest of it the last rivalry at 115 years why why am i not concerned with it
[18:41.600 --> 18:48.640]  why something's wrong with me you see i'm not a man i shouldn't be concerned about the end of
[18:48.640 --> 18:54.000]  america the end of the dollar the attack on the family world war three being engineered
[18:54.000 --> 18:57.440]  because after all i was given a football game
[19:01.120 --> 19:05.360]  i shouldn't be concerned with all the police state things i saw while i traveled the country
[19:05.360 --> 19:07.840]  that that just stunned me worse than i even thought
[19:12.560 --> 19:18.960]  i shouldn't be concerned oh mf global was 400 million 600 million 700 million a billion 1.2

[24:07.680 --> 24:22.480]  everything the globalist engage in i study it every move they make
[24:25.200 --> 24:30.800]  and when i look at the general public on average who is completely unconscious of the fact
[24:30.800 --> 24:36.960]  that they're being bombarded with propaganda that they're being physically poisoned those aren't
[24:36.960 --> 24:44.000]  just words you're being assaulted and it's a mind game though if somebody's dog starts
[24:45.200 --> 24:49.440]  digging holes in your yard to go back to the dog analogies most people will get angry
[24:50.240 --> 24:54.320]  especially if they learn the neighbor knows their dog is doing that and doesn't care
[24:55.360 --> 24:59.520]  and if you said something to your neighbor about it nicely hey bill your dogs
[24:59.520 --> 25:04.960]  digging holes in my yard and digging out my plants and killing them and if the neighbor said well
[25:04.960 --> 25:10.160]  bob i don't care get out of my face got a problem you even if you were a nice guy would have to
[25:10.160 --> 25:17.680]  control yourself not to get in a fist fight hey but the scientists genetically engineered the major
[25:17.680 --> 25:26.960]  food crops to absolutely screw up your endocrine systems to reduce your fertility the documents
[25:26.960 --> 25:32.000]  are public we've published them we've written articles about it and you tell the average person
[25:32.000 --> 25:35.760]  that they're like yeah right okay well everybody knows the government's doing stuff what are you
[25:35.760 --> 25:41.840]  going to do about it you see that's what it is you feel powerless the globalists are masters of
[25:41.840 --> 25:49.440]  psychology and they have learned how humans tick and how humans operate whole bloodedly
[25:50.720 --> 25:55.840]  and and that's what frustrates me because yes it's sophisticated but when you're aware of it
[25:55.840 --> 26:02.320]  you still have your instincts you're still who you are but those instincts were designed for
[26:02.320 --> 26:08.000]  another system a primitive system whether we're humans were in groups of no bigger than 20 or 30
[26:09.200 --> 26:16.800]  and now we're in this false technological system that was designed technology was focused for
[26:16.800 --> 26:22.960]  hundreds of years in certain ways to control populations and now it's been brought to a
[26:22.960 --> 26:28.320]  high science the problem is you reap what you sow there is a feedback loop
[26:30.000 --> 26:37.840]  and as hard as the ruling class social engineers the human architects as hard as they try to stay
[26:37.840 --> 26:42.240]  out of their own system it is blowing back on them so bad
[26:42.240 --> 26:50.960]  and that's the parable we see the parable everywhere emperor palpatine revenge of the sith
[26:53.520 --> 26:57.200]  tries to try somebody and it blasts back on him
[27:00.160 --> 27:07.200]  that's that's in every major archetype and that's basically what the elite are doing
[27:07.200 --> 27:13.920]  and i'm watching humanity mutate and fall apart and and become stunted right in front of my eyes
[27:15.040 --> 27:18.800]  and i talked to the general public and they're in a trance oh they may even go yeah i'll
[27:18.800 --> 27:22.640]  sure write about the new world order now will you please stop talking about it the game is about to
[27:22.640 --> 27:32.000]  begin the game i mean i should be 24 seven climbing up on top of billboards spray painting
[27:32.000 --> 27:37.120]  messages of liberty i'm not saying do that but but but you know i should be doing and you should be doing
[27:38.400 --> 27:42.960]  bullhorning on street corners going to city council every week running for office
[27:42.960 --> 27:48.320]  clawing at every point you can to get the word out
[27:51.200 --> 27:52.720]  i mean i've talked a lot about this but
[27:52.720 --> 27:59.040]  but the fact that now when Chernobyl happened in 86
[28:02.720 --> 28:07.920]  for six months they wouldn't let the children in europe northern southern eastern you name it
[28:08.480 --> 28:12.560]  drink the local milk or eat local vegetables they had to be thrown away because they knew
[28:12.560 --> 28:18.400]  that that was where it was raining down on and then bio accumulating in it and
[28:18.400 --> 28:25.440]  and they didn't want the children getting massive increases in leukemias and other other cancers
[28:25.440 --> 28:35.360]  directly connected to radioactive isotopes for meltdowns today similar in some cases higher
[28:35.360 --> 28:40.480]  levels are hitting the united states much higher levels in japan and the same thing in japan they're
[28:40.480 --> 28:45.920]  not stopping the milk the protoss they're just saying eat it and here they're just saying eat it
[28:45.920 --> 28:50.880]  okay levels went up from connecticut to colorado to california
[28:56.480 --> 28:57.200]  we don't care
[29:01.040 --> 29:06.480]  we don't care just we're going to raise the levels of what's safe i know i talk a lot about that but
[29:06.480 --> 29:15.440]  it's a fundamental change it's like the common sense life preservation public safety life force
[29:16.000 --> 29:22.560]  switch has been flipped off the globalist flipped it off in the general public to a great extent
[29:25.520 --> 29:30.160]  but they've now flipped it off in themselves because there's no way the globalist are to mean
[29:30.160 --> 29:34.720]  from this and then you read their writings a lot of the higher level ones are actually conscious of
[29:34.720 --> 29:41.760]  that and they say yes the goal is to kill everything we just want to kill we just want to kill humanity
[29:43.200 --> 29:48.160]  and then you find out you're literally dealing with demon possessed creatures
[29:49.760 --> 29:56.480]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[36:36.480 --> 36:39.840]  letter Jerry I'm going to play that last week and never do we ought to queue up that creep
[36:41.200 --> 36:45.280]  and of course the reporter who six months ago forced all this out in the in the paper
[36:45.840 --> 36:53.520]  locally is saying oh yeah this goes into children being brought through this system
[36:53.520 --> 37:01.920]  through the second mile and other systems to donors of course who else but this type of garbage
[37:01.920 --> 37:13.200]  would come up with this who else but these people the system is run by very sick freaks
[37:14.400 --> 37:20.800]  at the top and then they've got a whole army of mercenaries and compartmentalized
[37:20.800 --> 37:30.400]  just phony tough who only want power and you know what the god of this world is going to give it to
[37:30.400 --> 37:39.920]  him especially when those of us that love good and recognize good stand down and do nothing
[37:39.920 --> 37:49.760]  I talked about it while it was out of town the corrupt system is opening the gates of hell
[37:51.920 --> 37:55.280]  let me get to these articles and I'll go to your calls and I'm going to come back and go through
[37:55.280 --> 38:01.280]  the rest of it but you know I don't even think I'm going to cover this today this is what I got at
[38:01.280 --> 38:08.000]  the Grand Canyon because I I unpacked a lot of stuff in this morning I was in a hurry and I couldn't
[38:08.000 --> 38:14.000]  find a big stack of newspapers and things that I had to picked up along the way it seemed like
[38:14.000 --> 38:19.120]  everywhere I'd go I'd walk into a gas station in northern New Mexico and there'd be the local paper
[38:21.120 --> 38:28.000]  and it would say girls night out the female all female police units set up checkpoints on
[38:28.000 --> 38:35.280]  highways and search cars and so I said to Richard Reeves and the gas station was with me while we're
[38:35.280 --> 38:40.480]  standing in line two or three people in front of us I said look at this look at this checkpoint
[38:40.480 --> 38:44.800]  look how it's all women how they play men off against women and this compartmentalization
[38:45.680 --> 38:50.720]  and there's a Navajo woman behind the counter because it seems like in Navajo country and I
[38:50.720 --> 38:54.560]  know that women run things but seems like also women are pretty much the ones that work it was
[38:54.560 --> 38:58.720]  just always everywhere I went groceries towards your name at Navajo women security guards behind
[38:58.720 --> 39:03.840]  the counter everywhere Navajo women and she heard me she goes that's right you'd be surprised what
[39:03.840 --> 39:09.200]  women can get done and I went oh I know that is that the Navajo culture where women run things
[39:09.200 --> 39:15.120]  she goes yes it is and then I saw her with a guy buying beer in front of me the guy looked like he
[39:15.120 --> 39:21.040]  was 45 construction worker I saw her take his driver's license scan it and then say be careful
[39:21.040 --> 39:25.920]  out there and I went oh you're you're you're making sure you know he's bad buying beer you're making
[39:25.920 --> 39:32.160]  sure and she was like you know got all upset with me I said so you enjoy the system you like this
[39:32.160 --> 39:40.640]  in the newspaper right here this was a you know a whole case of them right there and I said you
[39:40.640 --> 39:45.600]  know you you like this she's like yeah I do like you like all the power the state gives you you like
[39:45.600 --> 39:51.840]  you like minding everybody don't you and I kind of just shut up there and she goes you be careful
[39:51.840 --> 39:58.800]  out there driving and I said I will but I didn't want to go into the whole thing of anthropology
[39:58.800 --> 40:05.520]  sociology psychology I didn't go into did you know there's Roman manuals from 1800 years ago
[40:06.960 --> 40:12.000]  that were used all over the Caribbean for slavery both of the natives and blacks that were shipped
[40:12.000 --> 40:16.640]  in and how they would take the women and set them up over the men as the minders
[40:18.240 --> 40:23.600]  do you know about I didn't dare I just looked at her and I said the new world order that you're
[40:23.600 --> 40:28.160]  empowering is what's destroyed your people and was going to destroy everybody else and I turned to the
[40:28.160 --> 40:34.800]  crowd as a pack gas station I turned to the whole crowd and I said this system is going to destroy you
[40:36.240 --> 40:41.040]  I said if you can't recognize that you deserve to be destroyed and I looked at her and I said
[40:41.040 --> 40:48.240]  you will be judged for serving this system as we all will be see it's time to let people know
[40:48.240 --> 40:52.160]  you will be judged you have opened the gates of hell
[40:52.160 --> 41:01.280]  and she was shaking when I left and that's good because I have the light of truth and any who
[41:01.280 --> 41:08.960]  seek it will have it I choose reality and not weakness and I spit this modern world out of my
[41:08.960 --> 41:17.680]  mouth and all the evil I repent for my wickedness and I'm as wicked as the day is long that's why
[41:17.680 --> 41:23.120]  God has chosen me and many other men who've been wicked because we can see and we truly know
[41:23.120 --> 41:31.360]  the bitter burden of evil and I want no part of it ever all of us are unbelievably evil
[41:32.480 --> 41:38.800]  and I want no part of it and it's recognizing evil from good that is the beginning goodness
[41:38.800 --> 41:46.880]  is success and beauty and health and creativity and blessing so incredible you can't handle it
[41:48.400 --> 42:03.360]  evil is twisted stunted crippled painful blinded humiliated freezing desperate stinking hurt
[42:03.360 --> 42:12.880]  it's rubble it's torn down cities it's starving children it's the smell of rotten flesh it's
[42:12.880 --> 42:17.440]  the evil control freaks turned loose to run over all of us forever
[42:20.320 --> 42:24.160]  and I will have no part of it I will have no part of it
[42:27.440 --> 42:32.800]  everywhere I went it was police state every newspaper every magazine every system I walk
[42:32.800 --> 42:36.320]  into the Grand Canyon every restaurant we went to it was a little cafeteria
[42:39.360 --> 42:40.880]  over the fancy old lodge
[42:48.320 --> 42:56.720]  the Grand Canyon book or give me a document camp shot please here here's a great idea become a
[42:56.720 --> 43:03.040]  Grand Canyon National Park Junior Ranger this is a thick book it's full of little little jewels
[43:04.080 --> 43:11.360]  and I went to multiple gift shops to buy my children some some children's clothes and they
[43:11.360 --> 43:15.680]  had literally in these gift shops in some cases hundreds of different variants of adult clothing
[43:16.640 --> 43:21.760]  but nothing for children but three different variants for boys and girls so six total
[43:21.760 --> 43:29.680]  of a junior ranger little hitler youth outfits and of course the forest service people and park
[43:29.680 --> 43:35.520]  rangers they acted pretty thuggish had a few run-ins with them for no reason saw them bossing others
[43:35.520 --> 43:44.880]  around for no reason anti-human lectures endlessly and it says here complete this booklet and it's
[43:44.880 --> 43:50.000]  pretty thick and bring it into them and they'll give you a badge and then of course when you get
[43:50.000 --> 43:55.200]  there it also gives you a discount if you fill it out on coupons to get the little hitler youth
[43:55.200 --> 44:01.600]  outfit this is the Grand Canyon activity book and it tells you in here how to spy on your parents
[44:03.120 --> 44:08.240]  only in america and east germany and how to not eat take hot baths and how to
[44:10.480 --> 44:15.120]  tell your parents how to you know tattle on them if they don't turn the lights off in their hotel
[44:15.120 --> 44:24.240]  room
[44:28.400 --> 44:30.240]  it's better to laugh than to cry isn't it
[44:34.880 --> 44:41.840]  and as they infect our crops worldwide with death then they have their courts come in when they
[44:41.840 --> 44:47.840]  sue you and rule against you when they infect you when their radiation gets on your property
[44:47.840 --> 44:54.320]  it's your problem they infected you the whole law of common sense of organic galactic
[44:56.560 --> 45:05.520]  law turned on its head where evil has all rights and good is an enemy to be hunted down and
[45:05.520 --> 45:13.120]  exterminated where the parents are to be overthrown where the men are to be overthrown
[45:17.360 --> 45:24.480]  where our women are servants dependent on the states where the men are are are disaffected
[45:25.520 --> 45:29.360]  frozen in an adult youth state of arrested development
[45:29.360 --> 45:37.360]  where our children are completely given over to the state and the chemicals and the brainwashing
[45:37.360 --> 45:47.600]  and the commercialism and the soulless video games with a simulated murder and repine endlessly
[45:47.600 --> 46:03.040]  stacked upon evil unmitigated unparalleled volcanic tectonic eruptions of pain and suffering and
[46:03.840 --> 46:14.000]  curses absolute hell on earth just waiting to roll out you think these dungeon doors that
[46:14.000 --> 46:24.960]  have flown open to release evil the the the simpering vipers turned loose on our world
[46:24.960 --> 46:32.320]  are only the beginning or only the cannon fodder of the true evils that are going to be visited
[46:32.320 --> 46:37.920]  upon us and if the establishment media doesn't say something's important it isn't covered
[46:37.920 --> 46:44.960]  or if it is it's in the back of the news as i told you two days ago
[46:48.320 --> 46:54.720]  as i told you on tuesday first it was 600 million on and on and on 1.2 billion more than 1.2
[46:54.720 --> 47:04.320]  billion oh today Reuters is reporting that anger mounts his mf global clients see three billion
[47:04.320 --> 47:10.880]  still stuck and they're saying some people
[47:16.400 --> 47:22.560]  will get their money back but most will not get their money back
[47:26.080 --> 47:30.560]  because the bankruptcy trustee regulators and exchanges have had no comment on the missing
[47:30.560 --> 47:36.400]  funds in weeks and have given no information as to how much cash they're retaining customers are
[47:36.400 --> 47:42.080]  left guessing exactly how much might end up in the creditor's process of the bankruptcy well you
[47:42.080 --> 47:49.680]  know why the head of the cftc is invested in all this with the corezine but i better not call
[47:49.680 --> 47:56.480]  corezine a criminal they might revoke my internet privileges because everything's a privilege to own
[47:56.480 --> 48:01.360]  a gun to have the right to life have a right to your own properties a privilege to travel is a
[48:01.360 --> 48:07.920]  privilege of course not if it's a privilege but the system says so and so the little enforcers who
[48:07.920 --> 48:13.520]  would have no future but to be a little little boss a little toady of the system every authoritarian
[48:13.520 --> 48:19.920]  society higher sociopaths and thugs and that conversion is now happening the wedge of totalitarianism
[48:19.920 --> 48:32.400]  firmly driven and they're just saying hey here's another article out of the independent what price
[48:32.400 --> 48:38.960]  new democracy goldman sacks conquers europe and it goes on to say goldman sacks now runs europe
[48:38.960 --> 48:49.360]  up the very group that engineered the collapse and see it's so naked it it it it's so brazen it's
[48:49.360 --> 48:55.840]  so waddling just just out in the open but you look at the public you try to talk to a man
[48:56.400 --> 49:02.160]  say a 50 year old insurance salesman who makes 300 000 a year and they think if you warn them
[49:02.160 --> 49:08.160]  about this they think you're showing off see if the american people they like to sit around
[49:08.160 --> 49:13.200]  talk about sports and show off to each other how many team members they know how many plays they know
[49:13.920 --> 49:17.520]  and so if you try to warn them about something hey are you are you concerned about this what do
[49:17.520 --> 49:26.800]  you think we ought to do oh you're showing off about finance stuff no no no no i'm trying to warn
[49:26.800 --> 49:34.160]  you uh what do you think we ought to do it's like i met the grand canyon and we're about to leave
[49:34.160 --> 49:39.040]  and i go let's go find that visitor center on the southeast rim because that's where they had the
[49:39.040 --> 49:43.680]  un sign where they threatened to arrest me a few years you know 14 years ago so i go there they've
[49:43.680 --> 49:49.280]  torn down the old visitor center they got this giant one there now nobody's around there's like

[50:37.440 --> 50:44.400]  stuff all over it and to him it's anti-patriotic to say america's in trouble i need to just watch

[54:47.120 --> 54:52.000]  what the soviets were doing in the 20s and 30s but he was called uncle joe stalin on our news
[54:52.800 --> 54:56.720]  he'd already killed tens of millions of people he'd already killed more people than hitler had
[54:57.760 --> 55:05.680]  lennon and then stalin had before hitler even got going people tried to warn and the
[55:07.920 --> 55:09.840]  different civil liberties groups would come after you
[55:09.840 --> 55:17.520]  and here i am warning people folks it is look it's going to get worse and worse and worse it's never
[55:17.520 --> 55:23.520]  going to get better from here on out it's designed to be post industrial do i need to quote ted turner
[55:24.400 --> 55:27.840]  bill clinton jacuzzo maury strong
[55:30.560 --> 55:36.720]  hanson or hanson at nasa do i need to quote all the documents as i've done over and over again
[55:36.720 --> 55:45.760]  in the video clips they want you poor just like what did wrestle means say in that film we did with
[55:45.760 --> 55:51.360]  him welcome to the reservation welcome to the reservation and it's true everything that was
[55:51.360 --> 55:58.000]  tested out on the native americans is the worldwide model they want you in controlled areas not
[55:58.000 --> 56:03.360]  self-sufficient that's why they're targeting amish that's why they're targeting while i was out west
[56:03.360 --> 56:10.640]  they're given the navajo homeland security is setting up a national ID card for them to track them and
[56:10.640 --> 56:20.640]  control them and sure enough i did research it's the women contingent i'm not even attacking these
[56:20.640 --> 56:25.200]  women they're attacking them all hitler said first you get the women then you got the children so
[56:25.200 --> 56:31.280]  follow the men we have a nation where men are encouraged to act like little boys forever
[56:31.280 --> 56:36.640]  and where the women are encouraged to be the boss and you see it in feminism you see it
[56:36.640 --> 56:45.680]  everywhere today and society is wrecked totally and completely wrecked and falling apart men
[56:45.680 --> 56:51.120]  think manhood is painting themselves up and getting drunk and going and screaming at a football game

[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:36.000]  all right ladies and gentlemen i'm just so desperate to turn this around i'm so desperate
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.600]  now when you read rockefeller foundation documents where they were developing in
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:46.240]  the 60s stuff added to vaccines is to reduce fertility without telling the public you see
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:50.640]  the white house science are shooting his mouth off about it you understand you're under a geo
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:58.160]  engineering program god just the stuff we know is so horrible i don't even want to imagine
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:03.520]  i don't even want to imagine because every time i imagine something i'm able to go do research
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:10.880]  and discover it's happening if you can think of it they're doing it if you can think of it and
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:15.840]  that's the key they say to military operations and espionage and all of it is getting into the
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:22.320]  enemy's mind and i've done it and i just i can see right through their eyes and it it is unbelievable
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:31.200]  it is hyper total dominance what is the most pure form of dominance it is killing
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:37.200]  them it is just getting rid of your enemy if you exterminate every last one creature
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:45.200]  then you have dominated it our ancestors in europe exterminated the giant cave bear
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.280]  hunted them into extinction
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:51.440]  once the prey now the predator
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:56.000]  the same with the big tooth cats all of them
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:03.280]  snakes in many areas of the world have been hunted to extinction
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:06.800]  any species of shark
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.560]  the new world order are humans that are predators and the prey is their own species
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:17.840]  they're cannibals they're social and psychological cannibals
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:28.960]  and i don't like being the prey you may like being prey i don't you may like the enemy feeding
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:35.120]  on you i don't you may like their designs and think they're cute i don't i run into so many
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:41.040]  and this is really a key key point i'm going to your calls i run into so many people
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:51.520]  who think they're part of the establishment who will i i run into chemist biologists
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:56.800]  doctors it's normally that type of professional in the scientific field who will say okay but
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:01.520]  there are too many people alex and then that's another argument and i look at it for the sake
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:05.520]  of argument i'll say let's say there is so you're for this you know they're like well something's

[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:55.360]  mill of bailout money he gave himself i mean we've reached a new twilight zone level where
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:09:02.320]  gmo crops infect your crops and you get in trouble for it or radiation blows out of a reactor melting
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:07.120]  down and then you get in trouble for it i mean that's actually in the news today we're entering
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:14.640]  the land of la la the land of criminal all right i'm going to your calls i want to show
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:20.640]  prisonplanet.tv or something uh curtain emos here working hard on this post holiday day

[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:32.560]  about these billboards up all over the country pushing get motivated with the war criminal
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:37.520]  colon pal who knowingly got up and lied about anthrax knowing that they were mobile british made
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:42.640]  hydrogen blimp trucks it was in jane's weapons quarterly we actually looked at him and saw him
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:47.680]  on the news and went to jane's weapons quarterly online and made the announcement uh nine years ago
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:55.440]  about but six months before the war started or whatever and actually broke uh that they were uh
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:01.520]  hot air balloon artillery directing systems they would rig cameras on them and then run them up
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:05.680]  you know 10 000 feet and then uh you know direct artillery with it they ran arach war the u.s and
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:13.280]  england armed them micristal helped cover up the murder of pat tillman uh juliani helped cover up
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:20.160]  the truth of 9 11 and that they were doing a drill the towers being attacked that day he said they
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:24.240]  were then he got caught then he said that they weren't then he testified before congress that
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:31.040]  they were so 9 11's that inside job got painted on juliani yellow cake war criminal lying about
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:39.360]  the uranium out of niger uh is for colon pal so juliani colon pal and uh the other guy
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:46.000]  i'm a crystal they all got uh sprayed painted or i know that signs that are stuck up there i'm not sure
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:55.200]  but that's uh we fit it's poster board so it's not even spray paint interesting and i thought it
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:11:01.360]  looked really really bright uh but uh so i guess they didn't even damage the all powerful almighty
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:06.320]  billboard that's probably a good idea you know what's a bigger crime putting some poster board up on
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:11.200]  a billboard to make a political statement that's incredibly protected under the first amendment
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:16.240]  or to lie to the public to take you to war and to tell the public torture is cool
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:25.200]  you know i watched clockwork orange yesterday and you know it's a dystopic novel on a police
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:30.880]  state future where they hire the the thugs the street gangs to become the police and then they
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:38.560]  waterboard people and then the state itself is involved which is run by psychopaths in social
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:48.000]  engineering of the general public and using operant pavlovian skinner type uh conditioning on the
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.040]  public which is what the entire society is i mean do you like being in a petri dish manipulated
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:12:00.640]  that's my point 99 of the political views out there are literal petri dish stimuli
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:07.040]  false paradigm limited spectrum information you've got to get full spectrum understanding
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:14.720]  to see how the world works you've got to study sociology anthropology psychology a basic history
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:21.040]  military history religious history because humans act the same and the elites use the
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:26.400]  same playbooks that have worked they just soup them up and turbocharge them today and then they
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:30.480]  write books it's incredible all the time i read globalist documents that are public
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:34.080]  that are exact things i've thought of word for word and then it's them
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:39.600]  them separately decades before saying it the same way but from a position of supporting
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:46.800]  i have organically seen what they're doing thousands of times and then in hundreds of
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:50.000]  cases later run into them saying exactly that
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:13:01.440]  the real science on this planet is human manipulation if you know that science you get
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:07.280]  everything else you get the factories you get the weapons you get the women you get the power
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.240]  and after you've had total power over civilizations you start trying to change humans
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:16.960]  and then you say why not just get rid of them there's too many of them at the grand canyon
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:20.800]  there's too many of them you know in the airways they're eating up too much of the resources just
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:26.480]  kill them well how do we do that we teach them to hate themselves by feeling sorry for the animals
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:31.120]  we don't really care about the animals in the earth but we'll we'll have them turn their own
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:37.440]  survival instinct against themselves and think of the earth as what matters and not themselves
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:45.840]  now watch and learn and people will sit there and call for their own destruction
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:53.920]  thinking it's fashionable and cool all the while doing nothing to actually help the earth
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:58.080]  okay let's go to your calls i'm going to shut up now i've got so much more to cover though
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:03.840]  george you know george is up next brandon and pennsylvania here on the air go ahead
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:12.400]  hey alex how are you doing i am good well i would not believe how hard they push vaccines if
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:18.960]  i hadn't seen it for myself my wife and i recently had our second child there's three doctors in my
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:25.040]  hometown of dover pennsylvania that have refused to see my child because i will not vaccinate oh yeah
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:31.040]  that's on info wars today uh and then now they're going to then say and just like to kick you out of
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:35.440]  school for not vaccinating and then charge you with truancy even though they triggered it it's
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:42.560]  all fraud they're now saying if you don't take your kid to the doctor you're abusive but then
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:46.480]  they're not seeing your child you've you meant to travel 50 miles that's but there are more and
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:54.400]  more doctors that know it's bad uh where are you calling from over pennsylvania uh how far away is uh
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:01.920]  ohio from pennsylvania pretty close isn't it no not from where i'm at that's probably 200 plus
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:06.960]  well you got to do it it's just like organic food wasn't on store shelves 12 15 years ago
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:10.960]  and now it is everywhere and of course they make counterfeits but that's okay it's all
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:16.080]  part of the process you've got to support doctors that are non-vaccine look have you
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:24.720]  done a search engine for your area uh and uh uh non-vaccinating doctors no i haven't yet
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:31.520]  my son was actually just born over the weekend well sir listen my children have had zero vaccines
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:37.280]  have you seen the studies where the flu shot only helps you with their own numbers 1.4 percent of
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:42.800]  the chance or 98.6 of the time it doesn't help you and then it reduces their immunity to the
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:49.280]  flu the next year by 50 percent major canadian studies i've taken these these documents with
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:55.120]  me to the doctors and they they've literally called me stupid and told me i'm going to kill my child
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:16:01.120]  by not vaccinating well that's because they're desperate the public the the majority have turned
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:05.760]  against them so that's why you're seeing a doubling and tripling it's like when a horse tries to throw
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:11.280]  you you you know you really dig your spurs in you start whipping them you know with the reins
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:16.640]  between the eyes and right now they're like yeah i'm you how you do what i say and they've gotten
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:20.080]  off the horse and they got that whip and they're whipping us right now they're going you're going
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:26.560]  to do what i said and they're trying to trying to geld us we're still stallion you know they put
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:32.640]  prozac in our water in our food but that's what the fluoride is but again they're beating us right
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:38.160]  now going you listen to me horse you listen to me like me mule you do what i say right now
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:45.040]  so what happened from there i pretty much said have a nice day i'll never deal with your practice
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:50.960]  and i'll find somebody that believes the way i believe well sir i'll say this the science of
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:59.840]  immunization does work to a certain extent it's been around 500 years at least quantify the last
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:07.600]  250 with smallpox and things but it it carries a lot of other problems with it now take that out
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:13.120]  of the equation like it lowers immunity it's been linked to increases in cancer because your body
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:17.920]  doesn't know how to deal with things and so when you start getting cancer it doesn't go and kill
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:22.240]  that itself because it thinks some outside force is supposed to do it there's a lot of studies out
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:28.480]  there but the main issue is you can bring the stupid doctor all the government documents where
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:35.200]  they admit they're adding things to vaccines or the recalls of vaccines or and show that to them
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:41.360]  but they don't want to look because they're committed to the cult and to the power trip and to you're
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:48.240]  an idiot and know nothing i mean sir you know who ran the Aztec kingdoms you know who who the
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:54.240]  priest were in the roman times they were the doctors the doctors were always part of the priesthood
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:18:01.920]  generally the top of it and they also studied psychology i mean look look at the sign of medicine
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:08.160]  going back a couple thousand years double helix snakes it's dna this is part of the lower priesthood
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:15.280]  and they practice on you i mean doctors a hundred years ago would just routinely take a small child
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:21.120]  and ram a tooth a a a a ice pick in through their eye into their brain in front of students you can
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:27.680]  actually type in doctor uses ice pick on child and you'll you'll see photos mainstream articles
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:33.760]  and women men whatever and and some of the first recordings were done you know about a hundred years
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:38.880]  ago and you can hear the there's photos with it laughing as they record the procedure as the young
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:46.000]  internist you know lower level cult members about become full-fledged witch doctors giggle as the
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:51.040]  person squirms and flops around in a straight jacket as the ice pick is driven into the frontal
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:58.720]  lobe of the cerebral cortex so see it's all about your trash you're an animal you're a piece of
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:07.520]  miscreant filth and they the priesthood know best you understand oh yeah but there are real doctors

[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:29.760]  understand that they are about being purist they are perfectionist in their dark designs
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:42.640]  and when you're awake the propaganda is everywhere and it is unmistakably converting
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:51.920]  our society into a nightmare system mark in north carolina you're on the air thanks for holding
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:58.560]  i'm mad at zealot i'm not going to take it anymore good i know i know i'm ranting today is it
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:04.400]  making sense i make sense to me i'll tell you what it's got me picked off i try to go and get my
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:12.240]  401k and convert it to precious metals and come to find out that my wife's medicare will
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:18.480]  and her social security for her from her disability she will lose it i couldn't i couldn't
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:23.280]  understand the way the account and put it but it's you know they've got it set up that if you
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:26.720]  have to leave your money with the bankster so they can steal it through inflation other things
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:33.360]  or then they'll get rid of the quote other benefits it's always a trap and if you do
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:37.040]  then if you don't but i've got i've got something that i really picked me off i'm watching the debate
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:42.080]  the other night ron paul's up there and they're badgering him they're talking about oklahoma city
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:49.360]  and i'm sure you watched as well but uh newt gingrich speaks up and turns around says see
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:54.720]  but they were talking about the result about mcvay i'm just curious as why didn't ron take
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:27:00.000]  the opportunity to turn around and say that mcvay wasn't the only one there i know ron knows about
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:05.040]  all this all a lot more than we do but but but see that's how they sell it look and yeah i'm
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:08.080]  going to get to that coming up actually in the next segment i'm going to get into ron paul
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:13.680]  and then more calls here's the new york times a few days ago before the anniversary of the
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:20.720]  kennedy assassination what killed jfk not who but what and then it was basically right wing
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:26.080]  hatred killed him and and and and uh lee harvey mcvay i mean lee harvey oswald acted alone
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:32.480]  and then it continues fox news historians claim new research shows oswald acted alone
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:37.360]  and just totally made up and then judge ordered psychological tests for alleged white house shooter
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:44.720]  and they try to blame the obama deception for this guy doing this they're trying and yes i
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:52.480]  did see it they're trying to imply that this republicans doing this that anti-government
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:56.960]  criticism of the new world order basically caused oklahoma city and they're trying to
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:01.440]  imply ron paul's involved in it they all know that the internal homeland security reports are all
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:06.400]  about ron paul and alex jones and people that are awake because we're the real americans and
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:11.280]  they're the traders that want global government and so yes uh i'm going to try to get to those
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:16.480]  highlights uh here in just a moment what's your take on it well my take on it is i'm doing what

[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:36.080]  navy my family's been in the military we've done our time we support we i put it this way
[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:40.320]  i love my country but i hate my government well that's what george washington would say and we've
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:46.080]  got so many good people in the military look at how just like last time 70 plus percent of all
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:52.400]  military donations republican and democrat in the presidential race go to ron paul so the military
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:56.720]  is good and they're trying to hire the gang bangers they're trying to hire the illegals and all the
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:01.680]  rest of it but it's not working and that's what's holding them back that's why they're shifting to
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:07.440]  this new domestic security force that doesn't even go through constitutional training like police
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:13.920]  this new federal goon force of the tsa who think it's their right to rape women including 14-year-old

[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:06.560]  obviously got a lot more time than ron paul but he is now number one or number two depending on
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:13.120]  which scientific poll in iowa number two in new hampshire uh and as soon as we expose newt genrich
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:19.280]  who they act like this foreign policy expert newt genrich has written the forward to two books
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:24.480]  calling for an end to american sovereignty he wants carbon taxes we're going to get to george
[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:31.120]  shawn steve and others here in just a few minutes as well but let's go ahead and play
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:37.280]  uh part of the debate the CNN debate a couple nights ago here it is i'm ron paul congressman
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:43.760]  from texas i am pleased to be here the debate because this is a very important debate but i
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:49.520]  am convinced that needless and unnecessary wars are a great detriment they undermine our prosperity
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:54.720]  and our liberties they add to our deficits and they consume our welfare we should take a careful
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:35:03.040]  look at our foreign policy right to the questions our leadoff question is from the uh honorable ed
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:08.080]  meese the former attorney general of the united states who's representing the heritage foundation
[01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:16.560]  at least 42 terrorist attacks aimed at the united states have been thwarted since 9 11
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:24.160]  tools like the patriot act have been instrumental in finding and stopping terrorists shouldn't we
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:29.760]  have a long range extension of the investigative powers contained in that act total bowl so that
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:34.640]  our law enforcement officers can have that why don't we have this before all i suspect you
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:44.400]  disagree i do tell us why i think i think the uh patriot is unpatriotic because it undermines
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:50.240]  our liberty i'm concerned as everybody is about the terrorist attack timothy vick vay was a vicious
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:55.680]  terrorist he was arrested terrorism still on the books internationally nationally is a criminal
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:36:01.200]  is a crime and we should deal with it we dealt with it rather well with timothy vick vay but what
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:06.960]  why i really fear it is we have drifted into a condition that we were warned against because
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:13.440]  our early founders were very clear they said don't be willing to sacrifice liberty for security today
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:20.080]  it seems too easy that our government and our congresses are so willing to give up our liberties
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:26.480]  for our security i have a personal belief that you never have to give up liberty for security you
[01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:34.560]  can still provide security without sacrificing our bill of rights yeah that is american others
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:42.400]  in but do you want to respond mr speaker yeah timothy vick vay succeeded that's the whole point
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:50.400]  you got a better chance of dying as i've broken down a million times from honeybees stings than
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:55.280]  terrorism i mean it's just the way they sap it the way they push the fear and this is one of
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:37:00.080]  ron paul's only points i disagree with ron paul's not stupid he knows there's the newscast of the
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:04.800]  bombs being removed at oklahoma city he knows about the southern prairie law center running the
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:10.720]  aleheim city compound that's all out there and so ron paul always goes with this line about you
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:16.320]  know just arrest bin ladner whatever ladies and gentlemen they've put al-qaeda in charge of libya
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:23.520]  now the government got the underwear bomber on the plane but see it's seen as baggage to be for
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:31.520]  911 truth to face reality and so it allows them to play these games where torture will keep us
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:35.200]  safe really what about keeping us safe from a government that can arrest anybody they want
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:44.080]  continuing here by the way jaren was just pointing out my ear you notice out of all the candidates
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:50.560]  whatever eight of them that are up there during that comment by ron paul they have genrich already
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:57.280]  in the split screen it's all preset up and then they go to genrich for a response it's all planned
[01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:03.520]  to get genrich like oh he's smart oh he has these pre-scripted things we're going to ask ron paul
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:09.280]  about mcvey ron paul's going to respond we know he's going to respond and then we're going to have
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:15.760]  newt genrich respond i mean it's all ridiculous 150 something people die so america the bill
[01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:20.800]  rights constitution has to die i mean it's in the news today that the government wants to pass a
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:28.320]  law where they can kill or arrest citizens anytime they want just just get rid of it all let's go
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:32.880]  back to a little bit more than we go to richard reeves uh here's more of it they killed a lot of
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:39.040]  americans oh no one a law that says after we lose a major american city we're sure gonna come and
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:44.400]  find you i want a law that says you try to take out an american city we're gonna stop it pause
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:50.800]  oh you try to take out an american city america's been conquered by the banksters that you work for
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:56.480]  the new bank of the world goldman sex system the global government member dick cheney when he was
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:39:01.360]  getting grilled on national tv what does it meet the press about a real 9-11 investigation he said
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:05.840]  you do that you're gonna you're gonna distract us for keeping you safe and a major city will be
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:12.880]  nuked is that understood yeah we know you'll nuke a major city al qaeda who they've now given
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:17.440]  thousands and thousands of shoulder launch missiles and they know the public's so dumb they'll
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:21.440]  they'll blow up some planes and say al qaeda did it and take our rights and no one will say
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:28.800]  why'd you give them missiles we'll probably be in libya and i say we that is we being drug bar
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:35.440]  hair by the globalist in libya in two years to quote take out al qaeda like they're already in
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:40.080]  the news and they got to go into other countries in africa to kick out al qaeda which they put in power
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:51.600]  newt genrich mr carbon taxes i mean he's like mit romney and and who wants open borders gun
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:57.520]  control abortion carbon taxes wrote obama care and the republicans loving because they're idiots
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:00.400]  let's let's play a little bit more of that
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:10.560]  that monster newt genrich who divorced his wife while she was dying of cancer
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:17.680]  these are sociopaths that are all about themselves let's go back to it
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:26.720]  i mean look at him this is like saying that we need a policeman in every house a camera in
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:32.480]  every house because we want to prevent yes beating and and wife beating yes you can prevent crimes
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:38.720]  by becoming a police state so if you advocate the police state yes we can have safety and security
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:44.240]  and you might prevent a crime but the crime then will be against the american people and
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:51.040]  against our freedoms and we will throw out so much of what our our revolution was fought for so
[01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:56.960]  don't do it so carelessly congresswoman bachmann let me bring you into this conversation yeah hit
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:01.520]  pause hit pause i'm gonna get to more of that next hour with bob Chapman but i want to get to your
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:06.080]  calls here at least those that have been holding uh richard reeves came in today we just got back
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:09.680]  from our trip around the country hey richard do you know where the newspaper is where it says
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:17.120]  girls night out all female police checkpoints i think it is uh somewhere on the vehicle somewhere
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:21.040]  i'll have to track it down but i remember seeing that paper because i thought i hold it off and then
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:25.280]  i couldn't find it i think i've got it somewhere i don't even want to cover the stuff till i get
[01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:28.960]  it all together of course i had the little uh the little activity books they give all the
[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:33.120]  kids about how to spy on your parents that that's nice at the national parks well that is nice the
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:37.520]  uh they just they find every way they can to encroach on us well the state knows best richard
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:43.760]  no no now i got a document cam shot over here of a printout this is the this is the two-sided
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:48.960]  one-sheet ron paul 2012 color printout i am the champion of the constitution ron paul
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:55.600]  and it breaks down where he stands they want to get this out to all iowa all iowa voters
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:58.240]  now we're not going to just talk about this we're not about some other ron paul strategy
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:04.080]  but even a big activist and a delegate and all the rest of it richard but we are trying to get
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:09.680]  this out to everybody right now so we're seeing him in first or second place in scientific polls
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:14.480]  and the media is having to admit now he is a top-tier candidate so their hoax is really starting
[01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:19.280]  to break now they're moving into the attack mode with these setups with genrich and people well
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:24.000]  thanks to all the grassroots activists out there that's why the polls are going so well for him
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:28.320]  as a matter of fact they're so scared of some of these straw polls for example here in texas
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:34.000]  they even canceled the texas straw poll earlier this year normally in september august they do a
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:39.600]  straw poll in texas for the presidential race and they didn't even do it here for that very reason
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:46.480]  is the grassroots activists most campaigns are run from the top down the the top cadre of
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:50.720]  campaign people put together some event or they'll try to create some news event
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:56.080]  with the ron paul thing it's the reverse it's from the bottom up we saw that with the creation
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:43:02.000]  of the real tea party the origins of the of the tea party were ron paul revolutionaries
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:06.880]  and we had the past money bombs like remember remember the fifth of november remember how the
[01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:10.880]  news media tried to spend that all that was all about a violent thing or whatever when it was
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:16.800]  just kind of a rallying cry to push everybody forward and all the different money bombs that the
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:22.080]  volunteers have coordinated and put together and the past meetup groups that they've done
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:27.840]  over the years the meetup groups that organically sprung up so this is yet oh and i forgot about the
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:33.840]  ron paul blimp back in 2007 2008 election cycle or ted anderson in the ron paul air force that's
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:40.320]  right i mean the grassroots and again look how ron paul's probably five times bigger this time i
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:45.360]  told people don't get mad if he loses it's fighting that wins now people have heard about
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:49.600]  liberating now the hottest movement on campuses and this is an upset belterberg group from tucker
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:55.440]  sources that are impeccable is that it's not communism or main mainline fake right wing stuff
[01:43:55.440 --> 01:44:02.880]  that's popular it's liberty it's anti big state ideas it's atlas shrug type stuff the system is
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:07.680]  scared well they should be scared because like i said all these other campaigns that you look at
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:13.520]  you don't see any grassroots real fervor to them or whatever and the ron paul campaign is the only
[01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:18.720]  one that i've been able to discern and identify that does have that grassroots fervor where people
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:22.960]  get together they get their websites together they get their coalitions together and they
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:28.160]  themselves take action and that's what really is differentiating the other campaigns especially
[01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:33.520]  and now we are just this close and the straw polls and all these different polls that they're showing
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:38.480]  we are just this close from really being able to go in and win primary elections in the past
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:43.920]  i said hey we can have an effect in primary elections but this time iowa new hampshire
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:51.120]  are key places iowa coming up this january third for iowa new hampshire is january 10th
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:58.880]  and folks i cannot tell you how key these are in iowa iowa is especially a key place because that
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:05.600]  is a caucus state and what that means is people literally physically show up to have their bodies
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:09.920]  and their hands counted as to how they're going to vote in presidential primary that's how they
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:14.880]  voted it's it's kind of like a convention type process and so these things i know this is just
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:19.840]  the day after turkey day and people are probably still hung over from the ut a and m game and i
[01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:23.440]  know you i heard you on the show talking earlier how they had a photo finish and everything on that
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:27.760]  game and i didn't even know until i heard you talking about the game so that's how unplugged i am
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:32.720]  from football but folks the time to start thinking about well i mean it'd be fine to be plugged into
[01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:38.560]  football we had our constitution but i mean literally now mfglobal's three billion missing
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:43.040]  really and they're just saying you're not getting your money and mfglobal was such a small outfit
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:47.600]  that prior to you and gerald solente talking about it i'd never even heard of it imagine if we see
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:53.520]  vanguards and fidelities and outfits that are almost household words going down the tubes like that
[01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:57.520]  that that's well that's what the derivatives are going to do and at each stage we're going to give
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:46:02.000]  the bankers everything okay here's 10 trillion more just saved my pension fund but if you look at it
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:06.320]  in the aggregate they're going to steal it all slowly first they cut you know half the salami
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:11.360]  and you keep half when they say give us half again give us half again pretty soon you're down to one
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:16.640]  slice and you're going okay i bankers save me they're like okay you get half a slice then quarter
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:21.680]  slice and then you know a tenth of a slice and then a tenth of a tenth of a slice until it's the size
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:28.400]  of an atom and and you're like thank you bankers for my one atom of salami right i mean it's just
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:34.160]  it's incredible i mean i've got a stack of news mainstream saying the world is now ruled by goldman
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:37.920]  sacks they control the country there's no more freedom in europe and they and they're raising
[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:43.360]  taxes on everyone and that's the way it is and you just pointed out that in europe that's where to
[01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:48.400]  look at to see where they're trying to make us go because in europe they are really cracking down
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:54.080]  on the austerity and and putting people there oh it's all coming here folks i mean i mean it's
[01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:59.200]  amazing but getting back to ron paul tell us about this mailer because this is you know my my cousins
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:05.200]  was uh is here in town and he's in illinois working and he told me he said he is doing the phone bank
[01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:08.800]  stuff or they give him the numbers he calls people and you know basically asking questions about the
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:12.400]  election to get him talking and then brings up ron paul and his real issues which is very effective
[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:17.200]  in iowa and other key stage he's talking about physically going to iowa well and that's what
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:21.760]  happened last election cycle is a lot of folks did go to iowa and i predict that this year
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:26.320]  even more folks will go to iowa we had we had people from texas going up to iowa we had people
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:32.080]  from texas going up to new hampshire and working as volunteers up there so this that's the type of
[01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:37.040]  grassroots thing that's going on with the ron paul campaign last election and this election
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:43.600]  that other campaigns really don't have unless they pay big big big dollars to all these people to go
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:49.280]  which the ron paul campaign obviously is not going to have but what a lot of ron paul activists have
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:55.120]  done uh similar to ted anderson effort ron paul blimp type effort is that put together a great
[01:47:55.120 --> 01:48:00.400]  brochure to try to break through the media burlin wall and their plan is is to get those mailed to
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:06.960]  every republican what they call a super voter regular primary voters in iowa and new hampshire
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:13.360]  they want to mail those out to those targeted primary past primary voters and also independent
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:19.040]  primary voters so those are key voters that are going to get these mailers and they're just
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:25.680]  at the rock bottom just cost price if you go to that ron paul products dot com ron paul is just an
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:32.000]  official ron paul thing right it's it's well it's sanctioned by all the it's it's an affiliated of
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:39.120]  like the daily paul dot com ron paul forums dot com all of these groups that are ron paul affiliated
[01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:44.000]  websites are together on this effort and that's how you can find as a matter of fact the way you
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:49.680]  can do it is you can drill down to where you can go to a specific county in iowa and you can fund
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:55.840]  that effort of getting those getting those brochures mailed to those particular counties and so the
[01:48:55.840 --> 01:49:01.680]  plan is if they can succeed in iowa and getting about a half a million brochures mailed to all
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:07.600]  the super primary voters in iowa then the next phase would be going to new hampshire and south
[01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:13.120]  carolina and etc but the deadline really is to get these things out on time because the january
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:19.680]  third caucus date for iowa is right around the corner the deadline is only about a week away
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:24.880]  for them to be in time to get these things out so ron paul products dot com and you'll see right
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:30.880]  there says mail the brochure you click on that link and it'll walk you through going to select a
[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:36.800]  county there in iowa and you can do a variety of other things to help there too but yeah all the
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:41.040]  all these affiliated ron paul websites and as you can see i showed you on the brochure
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:48.160]  they've got the ron paul 2012 the official website for ron paul and the daily paul and the ron paul
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:53.600]  forums websites on there and they fact checked and checked all the data on these brochures they've
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:58.640]  carefully gone through them to make them as powerful as they could and as precise as they could and
[01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:05.360]  is exacting as they could so you can go to the website and uh you can have a look at the brochure
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:10.240]  for yourself and they've uh also set it up for where you can purchase these and pass out in your
[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:15.120]  own precincts in your own state but that's another story and regardless even if ron paul doesn't win
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:20.480]  which he has a really good chance to even with all of the election fraud you're educating people
[01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:25.680]  about liberty you're educating him about what the constitution is not what a bunch of republican pro
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:32.000]  torture warmongering uh carbon tax loving people are saying not what a bunch of you know banker funded
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:38.240]  neural or funded obama people i mean what about the idiot occupy wall street subgroup protesting
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:44.240]  ron paul i mean i mean these people are are just absolute idiots those guys have pretty much

[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:16.640]  yeah i did as well hey ben listen uh more to the point here uh you were talking about ron paul
[01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:26.240]  i am a uh lifelong republican you know and and basically my friends told me back in 2008 that
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:32.960]  ron paul i should have voted for ron paul i ignored him and regretted it and uh and i'll tell you
[01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:40.320]  what i was and i use this word very carefully here but i was really in fear when i heard newt gingrich
[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:46.560]  uh give his answer to about how there needs to be two sets of laws one that you know the bill of
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:52.320]  rights in the constitution only applies to like you know stealing and you know robbery and theft
[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:58.080]  and murder but you know terrorism is a totally different animal and because they now under
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:02.960]  patriot act are charging people for marijuana with it and waving their bill of rights and constitution
[01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:10.640]  and i have even the aclu out today senators demand americans be locked up for any reason
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:16.720]  and the battlefield is considered your streets anywhere uh anybody can be arrested without
[01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:22.160]  trial by the army well the army admits they're preparing to quote pull triggers on the american
[01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:28.480]  people that was in stars and stripes three years ago remember that yeah yeah sure do and and the
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:33.280]  thing about it alex says is you know if anything that i could fault ron paul on is he actually
[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:39.920]  understates the threat uh he he really and i know he's not pulling punches and he's real polite and
[01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:45.840]  everything but he he i mean this is not meant to say you know i'm going to support him no matter
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:50.960]  what i mean this uh but the the only other point i was going to move on to was about the banking
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:56.480]  system like i have a graduate degree in finance and one of the things they teach you alex and in
[01:57:56.480 --> 01:58:01.200]  that's in that program is you're probably well aware and you pop to other people like me is that
[01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:06.960]  they teach you central banking is good and the light started to come on for me whenever i've
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:14.400]  realized like uh the bank that's in uh switzerland uh the bis and that is basically the central bank
[01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:20.320]  of all central banks and that's when i started realizing this was nothing but a fraud nothing but
[01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:25.040]  you know you know this is and i was and i brought that up to my professors and they told me this
[01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:30.880]  they told me not to go there they told me not to talk about it they told me not to end to leave it
[01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:36.640]  alone and uh exactly stay there i want to come back to you they told you not to get to stay in the

[02:00:35.040 --> 02:00:39.840]  mf global the euro the open announcement of bank of the world what that means what the next phase
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:45.840]  will be finishing up with george in florida he was getting his graduate degree in finance and
[02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:49.920]  i've talked to people who've done this and the same thing happens in fact they have specialized
[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:55.920]  schools if you get into upper management where you then go to private groups even above the school
[02:00:55.920 --> 02:01:00.800]  of economics in london where you're then taught how things really work and it's all very simple
[02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:05.440]  it's all hidden in plain view but you're just not told about it and so george was saying he he brought
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:11.360]  up the big mega central banks how they control it all how there was a level above what was being
[02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:17.440]  taught and he was called aside and told do not go there do not bring this up see when you break
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:23.280]  through like in the truman show and go whoa you mean i'm in a controlled limited reality and artificial
[02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:29.120]  habitat and then that's what it is it's like aren't you into the i was on the trip we went on a
[02:01:29.120 --> 02:01:37.120]  horseback ride and the guy was real nice but he was like how about them cowboys like the cowboys
[02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:43.040]  i said not really and he went oh man i'm a big fan wow and i said it's not that i dislike the
[02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:48.640]  cowboys it's that i've broken with it i can't get excited about something that's meant to be a
[02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:55.440]  distraction do you understand that and he didn't understand i mean when you figure out that your
[02:01:55.440 --> 02:02:01.440]  life is not your own and it's controlled and false and you see the authoritarianism growing by design
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:06.320]  you want to stop it and now they're just like yeah let's get rid of the bill of rights the
[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:10.480]  constitution just five years ago they'd be like we're not getting rid of that now it's like yeah
[02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:16.400]  we are getting rid of it it's bad you see videos of cops going i don't want to hear about the
[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:23.760]  constitution taser judges saying it judges ruling the constitution is not admissible in this courtroom
[02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:28.320]  i mean these are criminals people are like i can't believe they're doing it of course they're doing it

[02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:24.000]  we're going to uh look at the economy look at mf global we haven't gotten bob's take since this
[02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:29.040]  broke last few weeks since he wasn't with us last friday we're gonna go to bob here in just a moment
[02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:37.040]  get into the whole syria situation with russian and quote us the us's bankster bankster controlled
[02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:44.000]  us ships bankster occupied america ships literally it's it's occupied america facing off with the
[02:08:44.640 --> 02:08:52.320]  crony russian system another mafia but not as powerful or sophisticated therefore not as big a
[02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:59.440]  threat over the the the new peacekeeping bombing that the loving west wants to do in syria because
[02:08:59.440 --> 02:09:04.160]  they care so much about humanitarian things of course that's why they met in egypt while their
[02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:11.200]  machine getting crowds to talk about the the rumors about syrians might have abused a butterfly
[02:09:11.200 --> 02:09:19.680]  or something just all hypocrisy all just not even a veil of cover up they just do it all out in the
[02:09:19.680 --> 02:09:29.040]  open now with the hyper hypocrisy on display but steven michigan called in and steve was uh getting
[02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:36.720]  into uh he's graduated with his uh rtf communications degree and he was talking about how he wants to
[02:09:36.720 --> 02:09:40.800]  he's not going to wait he wants to reach out to people he had a question and i i don't know what
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:45.280]  his question is i haven't gotten to him yet but i said steve let me tell you how to have a million
[02:09:45.280 --> 02:09:50.880]  viewers a week right now it'll take a year but you will have a million viewers a week
[02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:59.680]  a million viewers a week on youtube and i've got hundreds of ideas like this that guaranteed
[02:10:00.240 --> 02:10:11.440]  i have beta tested in my brain by uh testing uh uh uh other systems that i haven't even implemented
[02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:20.000]  yet okay now let me tell you and i've already tested this idea out and not done it because
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:31.280]  i'm too busy i've already talked to local uh former rhodostar uh talked to his uh first
[02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:36.560]  talked to his brother they've got the big ranch to do it on they're interested and then i got too
[02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:42.960]  busy and didn't do it and i told them 10 million viewers a week conservatively in one year that's
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:48.880]  what i was doing but it would be a whole nother division that that they would be the the host of
[02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:55.600]  the stars of people say well why not go to restrict the tv well there's a bigger audience online
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:11:00.480]  and you don't have to mess with the limited slots on tv there's all this fake prestige goes with it
[02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:04.720]  you know some reality show person has three million viewers a week they're big mega stars
[02:11:04.720 --> 02:11:08.880]  that's the system trying to prop itself up you get three million viewers a week on youtube you're
[02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:14.480]  nobody now i'm gonna go to bob Chapman here but i'll finish up with steve briefly okay here's the
[02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:21.360]  big idea for everybody out there okay and quite frankly you can't even oversaturate this
[02:11:24.160 --> 02:11:28.560]  because it'll just sell the culture of liberty i've run all these talk show hosts over the year
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:32.720]  here's who would literally been over backwards to try to make stuff up about me incredible
[02:11:32.720 --> 02:11:41.120]  confabulations lies thinking that if they got alex jones off the radio that that would
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:47.520]  somehow my audience would go over to them what morons alex jones makes the liberty movement
[02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:52.400]  bigger for everybody alex ron paul makes the liberty movement bigger for everybody bob
[02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:59.680]  Chapman makes it bigger on and on and on you make the pie bigger that's a win-win-win freedom
[02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:05.600]  wave length not the tyranny it's a limited pie let's cannibalize our self-system
[02:12:06.880 --> 02:12:12.640]  so see i'm not i'll give you my ideas here because i don't care i care about the information
[02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:16.480]  and you can implement this and whoever meant that the best will do the best in fact you could
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:21.760]  probably get 20 million viewers a week doing this if you did it right i guarantee i could have 10
[02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:26.400]  million viewers a week which is a big tv show by any stretch of imagination on youtube platform
[02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:33.040]  alone within one year of implementing this okay ready to hear the idea companies by the way
[02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:37.840]  major networks have asked me to consult form and i've said no okay the system knows i know how to
[02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:43.600]  build an audience okay and i won't work for the enemy so i'm going to give you information here
[02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:50.640]  that's extremely valuable that this is just one of literally unlimited ideas okay you got to get a
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:56.800]  piece of property at least preferably 500 yards in an area where there's no laws against shooting
[02:12:56.800 --> 02:13:06.400]  firearms and you've got to shoot cans of coca-cola pumpkins uh exploding human targets you call
[02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:11.920]  zombies folks are doing that people love long shots thousand yards two thousand yards three
[02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:17.120]  thousand yards you can get local gun shops because they're a sponsor at first to be on it and you'll
[02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:22.160]  let you borrow the new firearms every week you go out and you and you and even if you don't have the
[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:27.680]  skills to shoot you go find somebody that does a little gunsmith or something and you do that for
[02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:31.840]  a year straight and don't get on power trips and fight with each other and stuff they have a contract
[02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:38.720]  and you put those up on the internet you will have a million views a week if you are terrible
[02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:44.800]  if you name it right and take action just put basic energy into it power in this universe
[02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:53.520]  is about doing things over and over again it's about commitment beating a drum it's about who
[02:13:53.520 --> 02:14:01.600]  wants it the most who'll go the longest i have watched for years these shooting videos on the
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:06.240]  internet and i mean some of these things are getting 15 million views a piece the average about a half
[02:14:06.240 --> 02:14:11.120]  million and i mean this is stuff that probably cost these videos a hundred two hundred dollars to
[02:14:11.120 --> 02:14:17.520]  produce each one and it's unlimited there are people with very low talent getting millions of
[02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:23.280]  views on there now once you've established your audience you slip the patriot information into it
[02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:29.040]  then you start a new political division of a youtube channel where you sit around and talk
[02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:34.480]  about the new world order and then say next here's our video and now you get those millions of people
[02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:42.560]  into the new thing and there you go valuable consulting information for you right there
[02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:50.400]  and i could right now launch this right now right now i could launch this with celebrities
[02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:56.720]  you know in the whole redneck kingdom endlessly i could have a tv deal within a year from now
[02:14:56.720 --> 02:15:01.440]  and wouldn't even take the tv deal because it wouldn't make as much money as a youtube channel
[02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:06.240]  with sponsorship you notice my youtube channel doesn't have sponsors i've chosen not to this
[02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:13.760]  would be a consumer and would also sell the the culture of liberty bonanza there you go
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:17.360]  so there you go now steve i can only give you about a minute because bob Chapman's holding
[02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:23.520]  you said you had a question go ahead yeah my question is um i've heard you say at least 100
[02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:31.040]  times in the last two and a half years tom riche got on c span and said that the uh the police
[02:15:31.040 --> 02:15:36.400]  state was going to be implemented it was just a matter of time but is that video out there somewhere
[02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:42.480]  is it no i told the story this was in like 2002 i was recording on vhs at my house i watched off
[02:15:42.480 --> 02:15:48.000]  and on two hours but it was him with big round tables you can now search c span you look for tom riche
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:53.600]  something like economic council or say he was meeting with all these ceo's and he just said
[02:15:53.600 --> 02:15:57.520]  you're going to have an idea to get a job you're going to have checkpoints on the highways for
[02:15:57.520 --> 02:16:02.400]  your safety homeland security will will run every facet and i've been saying that for nine years
[02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:06.720]  since i saw it now it's all that now they announced they're doing all of it so it doesn't even really
[02:16:06.720 --> 02:16:11.680]  matter if you can't dig up that video i've been on air for nine years saying it now it's happening so
[02:16:11.680 --> 02:16:18.800]  there's your answer but somebody can dig it up yeah is there is there also um somebody's email
[02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:27.200]  there that that uh we can email too to maybe ask for links whenever you know you just i sure wish we
[02:16:27.200 --> 02:16:33.920]  did you know uh i appreciate your call sir are you saying you want me to provide you prove everything
[02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:41.280]  i say i mean have my my crew send you stuff no no no i just it's so hard to find links yeah
[02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:46.800]  listen i appreciate your call sir i am busier than a one-legged man and then you know what kicking
[02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:52.720]  contest i am trying to get enough money in here to hire and then train the right crews
[02:16:54.000 --> 02:17:00.000]  to where i can have 10 reporters not two or three and to where i can find people that are
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:05.600]  skilled to basically intensify what i'm doing it isn't about making alex shone's a big kahuna
[02:17:05.600 --> 02:17:12.320]  you know in media it's about a system resisting them teaching others how to resist um and then
[02:17:12.320 --> 02:17:17.920]  people say give us a link you just asked for a link nine years old c-span just recently in the last
[02:17:17.920 --> 02:17:23.520]  year came up with a system where you can search pretty much anything by name
[02:17:23.520 --> 02:17:35.040]  i mean i don't even know what to say 95 percent of what i've covered here today
[02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:41.280]  i've shown you the news article now if you asked me for something nine years from now
[02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:45.280]  i'm gonna have to tell you have to go find it i'm you're saying it's so hard to find links
[02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:51.600]  there is a every day there's an eruptive amount of information on info wars dot com
[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:56.640]  uh and prison planet dot com i mean at this point the we're not even trying to prove there's a
[02:17:56.640 --> 02:18:00.800]  global government anymore they're announcing let's go to bob Chapman bob thanks for holding
[02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:04.880]  while i tried to answer that guy's question everyone's for the next 40 plus minutes uh
[02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:09.440]  what do you make of and i've got the big stacks here and i guess i gotta read them to the fella
[02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:13.840]  where they're announcing banking dictatorship worldwide and just kind of announcing like it's
[02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:18.720]  no big deal private banks headed up by goldman sacks will now rule the planet and you'll pay
[02:18:18.720 --> 02:18:24.000]  your taxes directly to them and countries can't get out of it and and and the euro will control
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:29.200]  what the countries do now and it's an open tyranny bob everything we said has come true
[02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:32.640]  and i guess some of the public will probably ask us for links to it
[02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:38.000]  well they're gonna have to go look for themselves because we're too busy to do that
[02:18:38.800 --> 02:18:47.920]  but uh i think a lot of that is just first grade propaganda i don't think they're really in a position
[02:18:47.920 --> 02:18:56.640]  to move into that as yet and that is starkly shown up in the situations going on in europe
[02:18:56.640 --> 02:19:02.640]  i mean these people don't know what to do they are really stuck they put it all together and
[02:19:02.640 --> 02:19:07.360]  it doesn't work that's right they always sold themselves on they'd wreck the system and then
[02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:11.760]  they'd come out on top but now that they've actually driven the bus off the cliff things aren't going
[02:19:11.760 --> 02:19:19.600]  so well bob well that is the end of statement of the week whatever and the point is this
[02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:26.800]  they created a monster what was it a natural unnatural association uh all the members in the
[02:19:26.800 --> 02:19:34.080]  eurozone had to have public debt of three percent of gdp alas and they knew darn right well
[02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:38.720]  that half of them couldn't meet that then they had one interest rate for everybody
[02:19:38.720 --> 02:19:44.000]  which was absolutely ridiculous i mean german he's paying three and a half percent well let's
[02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:48.080]  talk about that bob stay there coming right back to you let's talk about what's happening in europe
[02:19:48.080 --> 02:19:52.720]  will it melt down what comes out of that you predicted this three years ago or more uh and
[02:19:52.720 --> 02:19:56.560]  then we're gonna go into mf global now it's three billion missing they're saying you're not getting

[02:24:45.680 --> 02:24:54.480]  going back to our guest and then your phone calls Bob Chapman Bob I want to get into your own what's
[02:24:54.480 --> 02:25:00.160]  happening over there and and I mean I've got the quotes here about to global takeover by Goldman
[02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:06.160]  Sachs Goldman Sachs conquers Europe conquers them they sold them the fraud and got their agents in
[02:25:06.160 --> 02:25:12.080]  every position and now there's riots over austerity but I want to get into then into mfglobal we
[02:25:12.080 --> 02:25:16.160]  haven't gotten your take on this I knew it would be big two weeks ago driving down stock markets
[02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:21.040]  worldwide farmers getting out of commodities Reuters reporting it's causing a crash there
[02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:26.880]  why wouldn't they pay back the billion three billion now it's up to three billion why wouldn't
[02:25:26.880 --> 02:25:30.400]  they pay it back I mean they've got to know it's going to destroy confidence Bob Chapman
[02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:37.680]  I think maybe a part of the intention here was twofold and there's no way we can prove this at
[02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:42.400]  this point but I thought from the very beginning that the United States government might have been
[02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:50.640]  involved in this and Corzine was probably given a guarantee that look you do this for us and we'll
[02:25:50.640 --> 02:25:56.560]  cover for you and so on and so forth second of all I think they might have wanted to damage that
[02:25:56.560 --> 02:26:03.200]  system and it's a system that they can't totally control and I think they would like to control
[02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:09.600]  it totally and the way of doing that is causing problems in the industry you're incredible so
[02:26:09.600 --> 02:26:14.400]  for those that don't know they want to destabilize the entire derivatives commodity market so they
[02:26:14.400 --> 02:26:20.320]  can get more regulatory control which means more insider trading control so they can so they can
[02:26:20.320 --> 02:26:25.680]  game the casino even better that's why Corzine and the head of the CFTC who's involved in it have
[02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:30.240]  been authorized to say we're keeping the money and that's the way it is is to destroy confidence
[02:26:30.240 --> 02:26:39.680]  exactly and as far as the CME is concerned Gerald Stalenti is pointed out with a form of tapes of
[02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:45.600]  terry whatever his name is that they were bragging they have a hundred billion dollars
[02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:52.640]  and they can insure anything well why aren't they are insuring it they're obviously part of this
[02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:58.480]  but I do think it's going to drive a lot of people out of that futures market and that's a good thing
[02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:06.160]  because the least amount of power they have the better of course in those commodity contracts
[02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:12.240]  you've never had any safety whatsoever because quite frankly they were never with the paper
[02:27:12.240 --> 02:27:19.840]  they were written on and that was because the CME which owns comics could at any time
[02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:26.560]  override anything that was in the rule book and so you really didn't have any protection
[02:27:26.560 --> 02:27:32.080]  that doesn't exist in general markets so is this a test balloon even though he'd already
[02:27:32.080 --> 02:27:38.000]  gotten the money and it was in his sequestered segregated account they just I mean is this
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:42.480]  a test balloon then because if you're saying it's good to run speculators out why would the system
[02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:47.600]  want to do this then I don't know there's a lot of things we don't know yet
[02:27:48.640 --> 02:27:54.640]  including will anybody get paid would they just come out and say there's three billion dollars
[02:27:54.640 --> 02:28:00.640]  missing yesterday they said that they were going to pay 60 percent of the money back
[02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:07.600]  by the 15th of December you know it's one story after another it's something you have to watch
[02:28:07.600 --> 02:28:12.880]  unfold but it looks like a rope a dope you're right I mean it looks like a rope a dope because
[02:28:12.880 --> 02:28:18.000]  they said two weeks ago they were going to pay it back that week and didn't yeah that's another
[02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:25.200]  thing which is the extension of a time in order what do we do next we don't know and that's the
[02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:34.320]  same thing that's going on in Europe as well and it's because they just don't know and I can't help
[02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:40.960]  but think you know core design is smart obviously because of his background if nothing else you
[02:28:40.960 --> 02:28:48.720]  know he is why would he make a one-way bet that was what was an obvious loser now the government
[02:28:48.720 --> 02:28:54.960]  could have said look we want you to take that money over there and do this go along those bonds
[02:28:54.960 --> 02:28:59.760]  that are in serious because somebody else gets the money so it's a it's a it's just a transfer
[02:28:59.760 --> 02:29:06.720]  of all the investors money to the casino to help us Alex to help to help stabilize that market in
[02:29:06.720 --> 02:29:13.680]  Europe that they weren't capable of doing even through the ECB at that time and I that's what I
[02:29:13.680 --> 02:29:18.880]  think the government was originally up to and then they finally said well we're going to do these
[02:29:18.880 --> 02:29:23.840]  other things so we're going to take it down and don't worry who you'll be well taken care of
[02:29:24.480 --> 02:29:31.600]  and they do those things you know two years later everybody forgets what stay there I want to I want
[02:29:31.600 --> 02:29:35.840]  to see the grand design here with Bob Chapman on the other side of this quick break and we'll get

[02:35:50.240 --> 02:35:54.320]  of hitlers running our country and we're not going to do whatever it takes to get attention
[02:35:54.320 --> 02:35:58.640]  i saw an article out of phoenix arizona where they did a little banner hang with republican and
[02:35:58.640 --> 02:36:07.760]  democrats the donkey and the elephant and it said two parties creating tomorrow's problems
[02:36:08.640 --> 02:36:14.240]  and they're up there peacefully putting it up on an overpass they send a swat armored vehicle
[02:36:14.240 --> 02:36:20.320]  to them and the swat team jumps out because that's what the swat team's for they want to clear out
[02:36:20.320 --> 02:36:25.360]  the prisons of violent offenders it's actually government handbooks on this from eastern europe
[02:36:25.920 --> 02:36:29.520]  to put the political prisoners in it i was watching clockwork orange again yesterday
[02:36:30.240 --> 02:36:37.520]  and they send in the new prime minister the secretary of the interiors man and the secretary
[02:36:37.520 --> 02:36:40.960]  of the interior comes in the prisoner looking for somebody to do this pavlovian brainwashing on
[02:36:40.960 --> 02:36:49.200]  him to stop violence it takes your free will away it's opera conditioning and he says i don't care
[02:36:49.200 --> 02:36:53.600]  warden what you think about this we've got to empty these prisons of violent offenders to put
[02:36:53.600 --> 02:37:00.400]  political prisoners in them that's a stanley cubrick film from the 60s
[02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:06.800]  it's all about psychopaths running government
[02:37:06.800 --> 02:37:13.280]  what a genius cubrick was um
[02:37:15.120 --> 02:37:19.120]  the stuff's real i'm going back to bob chap and bob i want to go to some calls here
[02:37:19.120 --> 02:37:23.840]  but continuing to look at this then you predicted this happening so where does it go from here
[02:37:25.280 --> 02:37:28.240]  every time they implode another country and get tens of trillions for that
[02:37:28.240 --> 02:37:32.640]  then it only accelerates the next country so we know they engineered it they're being praised as
[02:37:32.640 --> 02:37:37.520]  look at how goldman sacks took over a banking dictatorship you know it's time magazine today
[02:37:38.320 --> 02:37:43.520]  can the u.s. fellow reserve help save europe's banks that means taxpayer money so while we're
[02:37:43.520 --> 02:37:48.560]  being lectured by republicans about cutting old ladies you know social security and how great that's
[02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:54.240]  going to be uh and and they're scapegoating welfare queens and people who i'm not for but
[02:37:54.240 --> 02:38:00.000]  they're they're the least of our problems what about all this i mean how far are they going to go
[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:06.480]  what does this signify for hyperinflation bob Chapman well first of all they brought in this
[02:38:06.480 --> 02:38:13.520]  team uh we have three members drag name monti and and um papalos say or whatever his name is from
[02:38:13.520 --> 02:38:21.120]  greece and uh these people who come in they call them technocrats and what they are is all bankers
[02:38:21.120 --> 02:38:26.080]  it's just another word for banker and they brought them in because they get they get serious trouble
[02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:34.240]  and what they're going to have to do is cut loose the six problem nations they'll have to go bankrupt
[02:38:34.240 --> 02:38:41.360]  default and come back to their own currency probably at 50 percent of what the euro's worth
[02:38:43.040 --> 02:38:53.520]  some of them may choose to go 75 percent default uh and the reason for that is for the
[02:38:53.520 --> 02:39:02.960]  the solvent group in the europe eurozone in order for them to take those six countries
[02:39:02.960 --> 02:39:08.400]  sideways say for the next two years it's going to cost six trillion dollars they don't have it
[02:39:08.400 --> 02:39:14.400]  they're people in a country don't want to put it up it may bankrupt them so they're going to
[02:39:14.400 --> 02:39:20.000]  have eight or 10 or 11 members of the eurozone the rest of them will be gone and they expect
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:26.640]  that they're going to be able to put together a stronger eurozone well in this crisis period
[02:39:26.640 --> 02:39:32.960]  what germany is doing of their leadership mrs merkel and schauble the finance minister what
[02:39:32.960 --> 02:39:40.480]  they're trying to do is intercheck legislation to be passed by the bundeslacht and the bundesdag
[02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:48.480]  and that they want them to give up their sovereignty to make fiscal decisions within their own
[02:39:48.480 --> 02:39:55.440]  countries once they've got that accomplished if they can then they can sort of button down all
[02:39:55.440 --> 02:40:02.320]  of europe well number one those other countries that are going to go down they'll get down over
[02:40:02.320 --> 02:40:09.440]  the next uh oh perhaps uh six months maybe it'd take a year in the meantime they'll be trying to
[02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:15.760]  bolster what's left of the eurozone it's not going to work and the main reason why is that
[02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:20.720]  they're going to have to absorb all this debt as these other countries default and then on top of
[02:40:20.720 --> 02:40:30.160]  that they're going to have to uh ring circle accumulate the circle of wagons so to speak
[02:40:30.160 --> 02:40:37.600]  and bail out every bank in europe because they're all broke now that alternative is
[02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:45.120]  monetizing and extremely inflationary and they don't want that but they're going to get it anyway
[02:40:45.120 --> 02:40:51.760]  and that should make the wheels fly off the eurozone how long probably a year or two nothing
[02:40:51.760 --> 02:40:57.360]  happens overnight i keep on reading oh the end is near well i've been listening to that for years
[02:40:57.360 --> 02:41:02.720]  well they're saying the end is near terrorizing everybody every week to get trillions more as
[02:41:02.720 --> 02:41:08.080]  they try to depress the economy while inflating and i think those two will balance each other out
[02:41:08.080 --> 02:41:13.600]  but at the same time all they're doing is enraging the population and waking them up
[02:41:13.600 --> 02:41:19.600]  and what's this new exercise of time magazine newsweek financial times of london london independent
[02:41:19.600 --> 02:41:26.480]  london telegraph going yes it's global government by the bankers but and yes the euro's authoritarian
[02:41:26.480 --> 02:41:31.280]  and yes it's secretive and yes it's deceptive and i mean it seems like they're trying to
[02:41:31.280 --> 02:41:37.440]  psychologically inoculate us now there's like a coming out of the closet of world government
[02:41:37.440 --> 02:41:42.720]  and selling the idea that they will fix it when everyone knows they're the ones that did it i mean
[02:41:42.720 --> 02:41:48.400]  there's got to be some point where core i mean take core design well i mean even if they told
[02:41:48.400 --> 02:41:54.560]  them you could do this take now three billion it was 600 million a week a week ago i told people
[02:41:54.560 --> 02:41:59.440]  it would go up i mean it might be end up being the whole 6.5 million that they went bankrupt with
[02:41:59.440 --> 02:42:05.760]  i mean who knows now they just buy up companies steal the assets the looting has reached crescendo
[02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:13.680]  levels bob Chapman i mean it just it's just insane it's conditioning exactly the way you put it
[02:42:14.320 --> 02:42:18.400]  and that's what they're doing there they're we're running so far ahead of them now
[02:42:19.120 --> 02:42:22.800]  in informing people throughout the world they are forced to admit what they're doing
[02:42:24.080 --> 02:42:29.600]  golden sacks world government and so on and so forth and one of the things about europe is that
[02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:38.880]  that most of the people who are bankers technocrats politicians bureaucrats they're all for world
[02:42:38.880 --> 02:42:44.960]  government almost exclusively and they always hark back to the second world war if we have
[02:42:44.960 --> 02:42:50.480]  world government we're not going to have any wars well they forgot about the guys running around
[02:42:50.480 --> 02:42:56.080]  with the machine guns who are hurting them into camps and they've gone through that before this
[02:42:56.080 --> 02:43:04.080]  is just a different way of getting there and so that's why the docility reigns in europe and the
[02:43:04.080 --> 02:43:12.720]  bank is so powerful that they were allowed being allowed to lead people around by the nose and now
[02:43:12.720 --> 02:43:18.720]  it's conditioning time because we've exposed what they're doing now they have to go on when they say
[02:43:18.720 --> 02:43:24.080]  well uh these people are going to fix everything and of course as you say alex these are the people
[02:43:24.080 --> 02:43:29.040]  who cause the problem and there's a lot of people who know that now and i don't think this is going
[02:43:29.040 --> 02:43:35.920]  to fly but that's a position in there and they have screwed up royale in europe and and i don't
[02:43:35.920 --> 02:43:42.640]  think it's by design well they'd always plan to implode things and consolidate power so they're
[02:43:42.640 --> 02:43:48.320]  going with that plan but did they not keep control of all their wolves running the hedge funds and
[02:43:48.320 --> 02:43:54.800]  ponzi ops where did they go wrong and all this they just got too greedy the too much too greedy and
[02:43:54.800 --> 02:44:00.560]  it's it is brazen arrogance that they have that nobody in the world can do what they do because
[02:44:00.560 --> 02:44:07.120]  they know more than anybody else about what's going on and that's it as a combination of those
[02:44:07.120 --> 02:44:11.520]  things and that's why they do what they do i mean you've talked to these people i talked to them
[02:44:11.520 --> 02:44:20.000]  them i never let them know who i am uh you you you don't have that advantage and uh you can
[02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:27.280]  learn an awful lot from people by they not knowing what your agenda is and so i just kind of skip
[02:44:27.280 --> 02:44:33.520]  around the world and find important people and get them into conversations and i get a lot of
[02:44:33.520 --> 02:44:40.480]  information that way they're not as arrogant as they used to be though bob they put on an arrogant
[02:44:40.480 --> 02:44:45.120]  countenance but i wish they were still arrogant because that means they're they're they're not
[02:44:45.120 --> 02:44:53.920]  as aware i don't think that they're um i don't think that they're as arrogant as they used to be bob
[02:44:56.480 --> 02:45:02.400]  well i don't very often disagree with the alex but i think they're more arrogant now than they were
[02:45:02.400 --> 02:45:09.840]  before and uh they have to put up that facade in order to think that they're the masters of the
[02:45:09.840 --> 02:45:16.080]  universe and you're supposed to accept that uh they're pushing the the situation that they're in
[02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:23.120]  and they're powerful control of it as hard as possible well bob sure sure sure i mean i mean
[02:45:23.680 --> 02:45:29.120]  they're buried i mean there's no way financially they can get out unless more money is created
[02:45:29.120 --> 02:45:33.600]  and that's the only way they can keep this machine going sure bob i mean i know that there's a lot of
[02:45:33.600 --> 02:45:38.720]  arrogance mid-level high-level low-level you got tsa guys who constantly are getting caught
[02:45:38.720 --> 02:45:42.160]  raping people in uniform because i think the uniform means well i'm above the law
[02:45:42.160 --> 02:45:47.200]  my administrative right is to sodomize you i mean i mean i understand that that was in the news
[02:45:47.200 --> 02:45:54.240]  just the other day all of this stuff is going on i understand that i and and just like hitler and
[02:45:54.240 --> 02:45:59.120]  the bunker constantly in the last few months thought that you know he was saved and some magic
[02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:06.320]  thing had happened but i don't know i mean i see people like brzezinski and others raising the alarm
[02:46:06.320 --> 02:46:11.680]  and saying we're in trouble i mean i see the white house regulations are uh saying we're in
[02:46:11.680 --> 02:46:16.960]  trouble uh i mean i do see some of their technocrats warning them i mean certainly that's going on
[02:46:18.560 --> 02:46:24.800]  well the government just came out two weeks ago and said and this debt was 150 billion dollars
[02:46:25.760 --> 02:46:32.560]  in june it's now 670 billion what is that that is the amount of credit to fall swaps
[02:46:32.560 --> 02:46:40.560]  that have been written this year that's a total of now what what do those things do they ensure
[02:46:41.280 --> 02:46:47.440]  bankers who have bought these bonds in europe that if they go bankrupt that those bonds will
[02:46:47.440 --> 02:46:54.400]  be paid for by the credit default swipe insurance right as a new york city well if they all six
[02:46:54.400 --> 02:46:59.840]  of them go under uh first of all the banks in new york are broke they're running two sets of books
[02:46:59.840 --> 02:47:08.240]  secondly and and more importantly how are they going to pay this money they can't unless of course
[02:47:08.800 --> 02:47:15.200]  all of a sudden we have another tarp and they say well you know the federation says you know
[02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:22.560]  his 700 billion uh go fix that thing up they may do that all right bob i want to take a couple phone
[02:47:22.560 --> 02:47:26.720]  calls here for you uh but but but just maybe do five minutes overdraft so i get to everybody
[02:47:26.720 --> 02:47:31.600]  that's at least holding and i appreciate everybody holding briefly uh u.s. warship aircraft carrier
[02:47:31.600 --> 02:47:36.080]  now at the coast of syria after the russians put a ship there they're talking about non-military
[02:47:36.080 --> 02:47:43.040]  bombing which is more orwellian speak we we really live in orwellville uh and and they
[02:47:43.040 --> 02:47:48.400]  met to discuss the unconfirmed crimes of the syrian regime in egypt while their western
[02:47:48.400 --> 02:47:53.360]  backed military machine guns people on the street and tortures people in mass so i mean it's now
[02:47:53.360 --> 02:48:01.440]  it's like we're planet hypocrisy or something it's reached absurdist levels bob well i think if
[02:48:01.440 --> 02:48:08.240]  the united states chooses with nato uh to go into syria uh russia is going to get involved
[02:48:09.200 --> 02:48:14.000]  and it could be the beginning of a third world war so what is russia going to do i mean they've
[02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:19.120]  said don't cross that red line that's a quote i mean what does that mean well it'll they'll
[02:48:19.120 --> 02:48:24.640]  challenge uh aircraft coming into the country into this no fly zone that happened to belong to nato
[02:48:25.680 --> 02:48:33.040]  and they'll shoot them down and incidentally the russian equipment of all kinds is just as
[02:48:33.040 --> 02:48:38.800]  good as what america's got and their their pilots are just as good so the united states is going to
[02:48:38.800 --> 02:48:44.320]  pay a big price for this one because they sent in 20 planes and uh they lose half of them i don't
[02:48:44.320 --> 02:48:50.160]  think there's going to be a lot of happy people and even if russia loses half of them they really
[02:48:50.160 --> 02:48:56.720]  could kill us this is a very very important port that they've got here it's their uh they're jumping
[02:48:56.720 --> 02:49:02.800]  off point uh for their naval operations it's their only Mediterranean it's their only it's their only
[02:49:02.800 --> 02:49:10.080]  Mediterranean port and it's it's it's absolutely strategic uh yeah this and russia sees this encirclement
[02:49:10.080 --> 02:49:15.520]  that's going on and of course china's teamed up with the globalist you agree chinese are teamed up
[02:49:15.520 --> 02:49:23.840]  with the globalist against russia that i suspect it but i don't know it i it's something i can't
[02:49:23.840 --> 02:49:32.720]  firmly say yes amazing but i mean it just shows they just keep taking country down after country
[02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:36.800]  by having rebels that they have attacked them when the country tries to fight the rebels
[02:49:36.800 --> 02:49:41.520]  they call them peace activists i mean what do you make of them openly giving libya to al qaeda
[02:49:41.520 --> 02:49:46.320]  and admitting it and i bring this up to good old boys all over the country i see signs saying we'll
[02:49:46.320 --> 02:49:51.680]  never forget 9 11 so i go into barbecue place and they've got you know all this stuff astounding
[02:49:51.680 --> 02:49:55.920]  everywhere and i go in and i say when i'm getting the barbecue i say hey i see your sign are you
[02:49:55.920 --> 02:50:01.120]  concerned about al qaeda being given control of libya they're like huh i don't want to talk about it
[02:50:01.760 --> 02:50:06.240]  i mean they just want to act tough and like get upset about al qaeda and i'm like okay well our
[02:50:06.240 --> 02:50:10.480]  government's working with al qaeda they don't want to hear it though bob they just want al qaeda to
[02:50:10.480 --> 02:50:17.920]  be given the basis yeah and then and that's true and that's just an extension of the cia and the
[02:50:17.920 --> 02:50:24.160]  us government and uh that will continue to go on uh here there and everywhere so to speak
[02:50:24.960 --> 02:50:31.520]  and they're going to uh probably push things i don't know how quickly it'll happen in syria
[02:50:31.520 --> 02:50:39.680]  um things always take longer than you know you think that they will but i expect that uh
[02:50:40.640 --> 02:50:47.920]  because they've gone in with this new supply zone uh i would think that um probably two or three months
[02:50:47.920 --> 02:50:55.440]  they might make a move all right bob Chapman is our guest we'll be right back on the other side

[02:54:21.760 --> 02:54:26.800]  calls here uh shon in tennessee thanks for holding patiently good to hear from you worldwide welcome
[02:54:27.600 --> 02:54:32.320]  hey guys how you doing good um i talked to you back in august i was in law enforcement for about
[02:54:32.320 --> 02:54:38.400]  10 years and i just wanted to make a couple quick points it might help the protesters or other people
[02:54:38.400 --> 02:54:44.480]  when they protest to quit asking for their rights maybe if they put up billboards or something at
[02:54:44.480 --> 02:54:50.880]  their protest stating the first second fourth fifth amendments on the billboard so it's
[02:54:50.880 --> 02:54:55.520]  plain for the officers to see so that they cannot act in good faith and violate those laws without
[02:54:55.520 --> 02:55:00.560]  it being in the forefront of the media well yeah and then they're also having elements of occupy
[02:55:00.560 --> 02:55:05.280]  wall street that's been proven to be george soros controlled and he's now admitting he's funded
[02:55:05.280 --> 02:55:10.480]  a bunch of stuff in the middle east going on to where they ban my website and things and they ban
[02:55:10.480 --> 02:55:15.440]  ron paul stuff so they're just as bad as the police arresting them for their first amendment
[02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:20.960]  and they also do things like trying to occupy stores go into private events with ron paul
[02:55:21.520 --> 02:55:26.320]  to then make everybody turn against them see how it's designed to turn everybody against
[02:55:26.320 --> 02:55:31.600]  the first amendment it's just like they hired fake hippie groups to spit on troops getting off
[02:55:31.600 --> 02:55:40.320]  airplanes for photo ops in the 60s and 70s this is a psi op go ahead well it again if you put the
[02:55:40.320 --> 02:55:45.200]  wall right there in front of everybody for the any camera to catch it it takes the argument away
[02:55:45.200 --> 02:55:49.040]  everybody always argues the first amendment or second amendment most people don't even read the
[02:55:49.040 --> 02:55:54.560]  constitution a case in point of that would be my father of all yesterday i was over at his house
[02:55:54.560 --> 02:56:01.440]  night cinema an email through facebook about 9 11 directors cut and i asked him if he'd even seen
[02:56:01.440 --> 02:56:05.520]  it and he said oh that's all a bunch of crap i said oh so you watched it he said no i don't
[02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:09.280]  need to watch it it's all a bunch of crap but they you know they shut the dialogue down before
[02:56:09.280 --> 02:56:15.600]  they even entertain the other part of the view so i mean to get the information out to force
[02:56:15.600 --> 02:56:21.280]  the conversation is what's needed because most people don't even want to entertain the thought
[02:56:21.280 --> 02:56:25.520]  well the way to approach it is you explain that it's the truth there are criminal elements
[02:56:25.520 --> 02:56:31.600]  that are financing terrorist groups hey father-in-law you heard they've given libya al-qaeda let me
[02:56:31.600 --> 02:56:38.960]  show you a cbs news headline al-qaeda flag flying over libya show him that first and then he'll be
[02:56:38.960 --> 02:56:44.000]  like wow now he'll do one of two things he'll either get mad and say i still don't care or he'll say
[02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:50.720]  wow tell me more but you've at least got a chance showing them something like that i mean i that's
[02:56:50.720 --> 02:56:54.800]  one thing concerned bill deberg group this last meeting this year in switzerland and we got from
[02:56:54.800 --> 02:57:00.640]  jim tucker is the fact that it's come out that their force on the ground is al-qaeda that they do
[02:57:00.640 --> 02:57:07.920]  they are scared of that that al-qaeda works for nato anything else you'd like to add well yeah just
[02:57:07.920 --> 02:57:12.880]  real quick also uh i haven't seen this guy for about three years but he was a da buddy of mine
[02:57:12.880 --> 02:57:16.480]  he's a real good guy but he saw me in the store and he didn't say hey how you doing man i haven't
[02:57:16.480 --> 02:57:20.720]  seen you in a while he said i noticed you post all that wrong paul stuff on your facebook and i
[02:57:20.720 --> 02:57:24.800]  said well i like him he's a good guy and he said well somebody has to and i said well he believes
[02:57:24.800 --> 02:57:29.200]  in freedom the second amendment he wants to bring the troops home he wants to correct our financial
[02:57:29.200 --> 02:57:34.640]  issue i said well those are not good things he said i believe in some of that i'm thinking some of
[02:57:34.640 --> 02:57:38.000]  that how can you just believe in some of those things well a lot of people that work for the
[02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:43.760]  system have been sold that we've got to have a little tyranny to keep things going yeah yeah
[02:57:43.760 --> 02:57:48.480]  again the you've seen the law enforcement magazines where do you torture somebody to stop a terror
[02:57:48.480 --> 02:57:54.960]  attack it's all this fantasy that the video games are where now you kill cops to stop them from making
[02:57:54.960 --> 02:58:00.480]  a mistake and and detonating the bomb you know it's it's this situational ethics i appreciate
[02:58:00.480 --> 02:58:04.320]  your call bob Chapman take us out to the next segment here what's your take on what he was just
[02:58:04.320 --> 02:58:12.000]  saying well i think there's some validity some validity to it and uh i think law enforcement
[02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:17.600]  in general understands these things you've got certain people in there you've always had them
[02:58:17.600 --> 02:58:24.000]  in there that are going to cause problems and whether they're sent to do that or uh whether
[02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:31.520]  that's of their own making remains to be seen and it's probably a combination of both and uh i i
[02:58:31.520 --> 02:58:39.440]  you know the the exposure that is being given to the bill de berger types that go stay there stay

[03:00:41.600 --> 03:00:46.080]  more calls from bob Chapman bob you were raising uh the exposure the bill deberg group and others
[03:00:46.080 --> 03:00:52.240]  are getting go ahead and yeah and and and they're very very disturbed about this they can't avoid it
[03:00:52.960 --> 03:00:59.600]  and uh we've you talked earlier about uh conditioning that yes uh this world government
[03:00:59.600 --> 03:01:04.400]  sort of thing is going on and we're the best people to run it but on the other side you've
[03:01:04.400 --> 03:01:12.560]  got these people talking about uh what they're doing what they caused and who's the culprit in
[03:01:12.560 --> 03:01:20.240]  this whole thing and so they they're having a hard time handling both sides and they're not
[03:01:20.240 --> 03:01:30.400]  being successful at muting what needs to be muted for their side so to speak and so uh i think uh
[03:01:32.320 --> 03:01:37.280]  the gains that they're trying to make they're paying for extremely painfully
[03:01:37.280 --> 03:01:42.240]  let's talk to mike in new jersey mike thanks for holding
[03:01:43.760 --> 03:01:51.360]  yeah i can hear me good yes sir okay um i'm looking at a pdf it says civil action 8500 and it was
[03:01:51.360 --> 03:01:58.240]  filed in the southern district of new york and it seems to be that it's against uh the un banky moon
[03:01:58.800 --> 03:02:03.280]  the republic of illy and brosconi and they're choosing them of stealing bonds worth over a
[03:02:03.280 --> 03:02:07.840]  trillion dollars i was wondering if you guys have heard of this and the judges judge how well
[03:02:08.400 --> 03:02:13.120]  h-o-l-w-e i know there's a lot of actions going on with stolen bonds all over the world i heard
[03:02:13.120 --> 03:02:20.160]  about this idly thing a while back bob i heard it from time to time but i don't have uh knowledge
[03:02:20.160 --> 03:02:24.960]  of what the gentleman's speaking of yeah who's bringing the civil action a lot of bogus bonds
[03:02:24.960 --> 03:02:33.280]  over the last number of years it says neil f keen and the last name is k-e-e-n-a-n and the law firm is
[03:02:33.920 --> 03:02:41.680]  bleakly platt and schmidt l-l-t do me a favor email that to show tips that's very interesting sir
[03:02:42.560 --> 03:02:50.240]  okay i will anything else yeah one more thing i've never heard of the act of 1871 in which they uh
[03:02:50.240 --> 03:02:56.640]  uh they created a corporate government for the united states corporation yes i have bob jetman
[03:02:58.720 --> 03:03:05.040]  uh no comment i'm not familiar enough with it to make intelligent commentary they definitely
[03:03:05.040 --> 03:03:10.640]  operate under two different laws and now they're removing the republic and phasing in this corporate
[03:03:10.640 --> 03:03:14.800]  administrative law system there's no doubt about that i appreciate your call one more for bob jetman
[03:03:14.800 --> 03:03:20.720]  here and i'm sorry to the others i'll see you this sunday four to six i'll be live uh baron in alabama

[03:03:33.200 --> 03:03:37.360]  i actually can't understand you your speakerphone's too bad can you actually pick the phone up
[03:03:37.360 --> 03:03:44.160]  okay can you hear me better now yeah go ahead yeah so the question that i have basically uh
[03:03:44.800 --> 03:03:50.960]  you touched on how people uh kind of go running from the truth when you try to confront people
[03:03:50.960 --> 03:03:56.480]  about things right so there's two type of people out there that one go running and the other type
[03:03:56.480 --> 03:04:03.520]  basically have to go on at whatever their pace is now what i've done uh you you basically inspired
[03:04:03.520 --> 03:04:10.720]  me to start my own uh website basically amplifying your message i've emailed a couple times i've
[03:04:10.720 --> 03:04:16.240]  actually put up a couple of videos um one about how on the brooklyn bridge that day that they march
[03:04:16.240 --> 03:04:22.640]  uh the occupy wall street protest snatched an info wars dot com sign uh down from in front of the
[03:04:22.640 --> 03:04:28.160]  live stream camera yeah somebody said for me to come watch a video of that and then i forgot to
[03:04:28.160 --> 03:04:34.160]  never point it out but yeah the occupier leadership doesn't like ron paul or info wars dot com they banned
[03:04:34.160 --> 03:04:39.920]  us on their websites we're almost out of time finish up the story okay so my my basic point was
[03:04:39.920 --> 03:04:46.640]  that they seem to be pulling all of these guns to basically where they're trying to slow down the
[03:04:46.640 --> 03:04:51.760]  the awakening and i want to know what you see coming as far as the economy because they seem
[03:04:51.760 --> 03:04:55.680]  to be slowing the economy down but feeding everything else up like the wars the police
[03:04:55.680 --> 03:04:58.960]  don't hear you i'll have to talk about it sunday thank you bob chap and we'll see you back sunday
[03:04:58.960 --> 03:05:26.240]  four to six p.m. free transmission starts now
