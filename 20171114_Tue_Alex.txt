[00:00.000 --> 00:17.440]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:17.440 --> 00:34.160]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[00:34.160 --> 00:38.960]  Well, I told you Saturday in a special transmission I did here from the studios
[00:38.960 --> 00:48.560]  that the word is a new special counsel is being prepared for Hillary, but also for everybody
[00:48.560 --> 00:53.440]  else involved with Uranium One. That means John Podesta, Tony Podesta, Robert Mueller,
[00:54.800 --> 01:01.280]  the entire list of the Legion of Doom, the normal cast of characters. And now,
[01:02.800 --> 01:08.000]  former Senator and now Attorney General Jeff Sessions testifying today has said that they are
[01:08.000 --> 01:17.840]  open to a special counsel and that they are considering doing it. It's also in responses
[01:17.840 --> 01:23.600]  to congressional leaders that have already launched hearings asking, why are we going after Trump
[01:24.720 --> 01:29.600]  when there's no evidence? But then there's complete open and shut cases against the Democrats.
[01:29.600 --> 01:39.760]  Separately, separately, Donald Trump Jr. released his whopping three communications
[01:39.760 --> 01:45.680]  with WikiLeaks during the campaign asking for information. I mean, during the campaign,
[01:46.640 --> 01:52.560]  Julian Assange was on CNN. Julian Assange was on Fox News. Julian Assange did New York Times
[01:52.560 --> 01:58.240]  interviews. He doesn't do them now because they just lie and attack him. But by the extension
[01:58.240 --> 02:02.320]  that you're a Russian agent, if you talk to Julian Assange, when there's no evidence that Julian Assange
[02:03.120 --> 02:10.960]  is a Russian agent, it's just crazy. It's absolutely amazing, but they're back at it.
[02:11.600 --> 02:16.640]  There have been hundreds of news articles the last week by fake news outlets like The Washington
[02:16.640 --> 02:22.480]  Post owned by Jeff Bezos, his anti-free speech monopoly man, going, we need to have Drudge
[02:22.480 --> 02:30.000]  Report shut down. He linked to Info Wars. Info Wars links to Russian news. That's total mental
[02:30.000 --> 02:36.400]  illness. Then of course, we did an analysis of it on average. It's an average month. Drudge links
[02:36.400 --> 02:42.960]  to those sites 10 times more than Info Wars or Breitbart. So he links The New York Times and
[02:42.960 --> 02:51.760]  Washington Post. Does that mean he works The New York Times or The Washington Post? It's just
[02:51.760 --> 02:59.120]  next level. Ladies and gentlemen, and they did analysis showing how much he links to Info Wars
[02:59.920 --> 03:05.760]  versus how much he links to RT or Sputnik, but then they don't show you how much they're linking
[03:06.480 --> 03:11.600]  to other mainstream so-called mainstream news establishment news. But as you can see, the
[03:11.600 --> 03:16.800]  traffic is way, way, way, way above. The amount of Washington Post traffic
[03:16.800 --> 03:28.880]  that Info Wars would get is 10 times or more. We show up at what? About 15% right there and
[03:28.880 --> 03:35.840]  they're up at 400%. So do the math. If we're at 15%, they're 400%. I guess that's way more than 10
[03:35.840 --> 03:45.120]  times. I was just eyeballing it. What's the percentage? If I'm at 15% or 20%, let's say 20's
[03:45.120 --> 03:55.200]  a peak and they're at 400% the links. Do we have a calculator? It's way more than 10 times. 20 times.
[03:55.200 --> 04:02.320]  20 times? 20 times. So excuse me, it's 20 times. And the response that Drudge gets
[04:04.240 --> 04:10.240]  for literally flooding Jeff Bezos with money and traffic is we want to shut you down. You're a Russian
[04:10.240 --> 04:13.840]  agent. They have all these other articles saying there's a federal elections commission
[04:13.840 --> 04:22.000]  investigation and a federal trade commission investigation. And Drudge then tweets out that
[04:22.000 --> 04:28.400]  he's responsible for 37% of their traffic. And how do they respond? Urinating directly in his face
[04:28.400 --> 04:38.800]  and calling for his arrest. That is the entitled SJW arrogance of a man worth $100 billion in one
[04:38.800 --> 04:45.920]  company, Jeff Bezos, with the Washington Post hell bent on shutting down free speech in America.
[04:45.920 --> 04:53.040]  And he even got $500 million this year in CIA money or the last things Obama did to run propaganda.
[04:53.040 --> 05:04.160]  I mean, he even gets taxpayer money that big. We're running. The biggest specials we've run in
[05:04.160 --> 05:10.480]  like six months and free shipping store wide at infostore.com. And when we sell products at this
[05:10.480 --> 05:14.800]  lower price, we got to sell a lot of it from the operation. But I know the products are so good.
[05:14.800 --> 05:18.480]  Even though we make a very small profit on each item, you'll like them and then order more,
[05:18.480 --> 05:23.840]  especially things like the coffee. It's so good or our toothpaste or our mouthwash or our vitamin
[05:23.840 --> 05:30.480]  mineral fusion fruit punch drink. It's got all the amino acids and multivitamins are probiotic.
[05:30.480 --> 05:35.920]  All of it super mill vitality 50% off never done that and free shipping boom super film
[05:35.920 --> 05:42.000]  vitality 50% off with free shipping boom bomb defense 50% off with free shipping with the free
[05:42.000 --> 05:47.200]  shipping folks. It's a loss leader. You sign up for auto ship. We're losing like $6 $7 on this.
[05:47.200 --> 05:51.280]  That matter. I just want you to see how great it is. We are now four and a half hours into the
[05:51.280 --> 06:04.160]  worldwide broadcast. America rebirth and Renaissance was so much coming up today.
[06:07.920 --> 06:14.160]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[06:14.160 --> 06:25.680]  Okay, to say that today is an overload of news again is really putting it lightly. Wow.
[06:34.720 --> 06:42.080]  We notice themes that develop in the news without even looking every day.
[06:42.080 --> 06:49.680]  I see five or six news articles of anti Trumpers caught with bombs,
[06:50.240 --> 06:54.880]  caught with weapons, planting mass killing sprees. Now, whenever they
[06:57.200 --> 07:02.160]  get caught, it's just a local news story. When they hit a big target like the church
[07:02.160 --> 07:11.120]  a week and a half ago here in Texas, south of Austin, Texas in Sutherland, it gets covered up.
[07:12.080 --> 07:18.240]  But here are just two today. Anti Trump arrested for killing spree talk. Had a bunch of weapons
[07:18.240 --> 07:22.720]  was planning to kill Trump supporters. And there's another one leftist who wanted to kill first
[07:22.720 --> 07:30.960]  responders found with arsenal 200 containers and bomb making materials. 31 year old Christopher
[07:30.960 --> 07:36.080]  Langer lived with his parents and said he was planning to kill Trump supporters. He told them,
[07:37.520 --> 07:46.800]  look at that basement dwelling mentally ill troll that goes around projecting his hatred of
[07:46.800 --> 07:55.920]  himself on to everybody. And there are legions of these goblin creatures who think it's totally
[07:55.920 --> 08:02.480]  normal to attack you. In fact, we've had this activist on before and again have nothing against
[08:02.480 --> 08:10.160]  her because she's not sexualizing children that we've had her on before. She ever back on
[08:10.160 --> 08:18.240]  very articulate, smart person, Blair White, the, I would say attractive trans. Usually they're not,
[08:18.240 --> 08:22.320]  you know, it's kind of reflecting that she isn't super ugly and doesn't weigh 500 pounds, but
[08:22.320 --> 08:29.600]  sorry, I'm back resting. Trans activists assaulted in Hollywood for wearing make America great again
[08:29.600 --> 08:36.800]  hat. And two men wearing the little pink hats that we can't say the name of.
[08:39.280 --> 08:45.120]  They come up and physically attack her. And then her friend is a woman goes after them. So they
[08:45.120 --> 08:53.440]  then run from the women. So there you go. And of course, it's beta cock males, white males that
[08:53.440 --> 09:01.600]  did it. So that's what they do. And this is all over the United States, ladies and gentlemen,
[09:01.600 --> 09:06.480]  they throw stuff in your face, they punch you, they break your fingers, they break your nail,
[09:07.600 --> 09:13.280]  they go after you. And that ties into this story that was just mentioning leftist who wanted to
[09:13.280 --> 09:19.760]  kill first responders with arsenal of explosives, hated Trump was part of Occupy Wall Street Black
[09:19.760 --> 09:27.040]  Lives Matter leftist panic over the possibility of having to spend Thanksgiving with Trump supporting
[09:27.040 --> 09:31.920]  family. Well, I mean, you guys don't want families anyway, as you said, the nuclear family's bad
[09:31.920 --> 09:38.880]  and evil. So how about how about people this Thanksgiving don't cater to their mentally ill
[09:38.880 --> 09:45.200]  leftist family? I mean, just don't invite them. Let them go have the government as their family,
[09:45.200 --> 09:50.400]  let them go out, quit, quit catering to them. Here's another one coming soon to Washington,
[09:50.400 --> 09:58.000]  anti Trump hotel for liberals. And it offers all these big jumbo Tron TVs about how wonderful
[09:58.000 --> 10:03.520]  liberals are and how great Obama and Hillary are, and how terrible conservatives are. And then
[10:03.520 --> 10:08.080]  there's just, I guess, like flashing screens of Republicans and Nazi symbols everywhere. So it's
[10:08.080 --> 10:13.360]  kind of like a reeducation camp mental patient center for folks that want to be immersed in the
[10:13.360 --> 10:19.040]  lies. That's how to Bloomberg. And that's what Apple and Google and Facebook and Twitter are all
[10:19.040 --> 10:25.200]  building their own little mini mentally ill cities, where everybody that drinks the globalist
[10:25.200 --> 10:30.880]  Kool-Aid can go live in a literal reeducation camp, where there's flashing screens everywhere,
[10:30.880 --> 10:34.720]  telling you you're a winner, feeding your dopamine rush that you're taking over America,
[10:34.720 --> 10:38.240]  that you're going to break up those families, that you're going to sexualize children,
[10:39.120 --> 10:43.200]  you're going to stop the effing white males, even though effing white males run your world.
[10:45.440 --> 10:50.160]  That's what they're building is little artificial bubble cities. That's,
[10:50.160 --> 10:55.360]  that's where this is going. Twitter, Facebook, Google, Bezos is announced, he's building
[10:56.400 --> 11:01.120]  bubble cities where their neighborhoods with glass enclosures, where you only go in those
[11:01.120 --> 11:05.680]  cities and the doors open for you. You need to feel powerful that nobody else can come in.
[11:05.680 --> 11:13.200]  You just built your own elite walled city where the SJW, mainly white people can live,
[11:13.920 --> 11:20.960]  calling everyone outside the bubbles racist. I'm not joking. Bill Gates is building them too.
[11:20.960 --> 11:25.440]  This is the future. And then you'll pay for the exclusivity of being in the bubble.
[11:25.440 --> 11:34.080]  These are true bubble children. So we have that theme developing here today. You want to see
[11:34.080 --> 11:40.080]  actual schematics of the bubble cities, just type in Google announces self-contained neighborhood.
[11:40.080 --> 11:44.000]  And then you look, it's, they're not so much bubbles because they're, they're, they're square
[11:44.000 --> 11:50.560]  and then connect and some are bubbles. Of course, you'll be forced into these soon enough because
[11:50.560 --> 11:56.480]  the GMO is going to be so toxic and all this solar radiation making it through because they're
[11:56.480 --> 12:01.440]  frying the ozone layer with the chem trailing and all the barium salts, aluminum dioxide is so
[12:01.440 --> 12:06.640]  poisoning the soil that you'll have to go indoor soon to grow things. So we can kind of see their
[12:06.640 --> 12:13.760]  plan taking shape, making the outside so horrible that we're again forced into the bubble cities
[12:13.760 --> 12:21.600]  that were promoted by the New York times, the UN and the zeitgeist communist utopia. And the leader,
[12:21.600 --> 12:26.880]  Peter Joseph, with his fake name, came on the show and said, if you refuse to go to the bubble
[12:26.880 --> 12:32.240]  city, you will be reeducated. And a few years later, we asked him back on, he said, I never said,
[12:32.240 --> 12:36.400]  you'll be forced to reeducation even though we have the tape. And I said, Peter, we do have the
[12:36.400 --> 12:42.160]  tape. And he says, you do not have the tape. You do not and say it doesn't exist. And we will be
[12:42.160 --> 12:48.400]  friends on the phone. I'm like, dude, I'm not your cult. He taught just like the so-called
[12:48.400 --> 12:54.400]  industrialist, it's taken over the world in the new Blade Runner. He literally talks with that
[12:54.400 --> 13:01.680]  same effected, I am in control now. You will live in a bubble city. Robots will run everything for
[13:01.680 --> 13:08.160]  you. They will tell you what to do and decide what you will be. It is total freedom. I said,
[13:08.160 --> 13:13.280]  who programs the mainframe computer that controls our life. That will not be discussed.
[13:13.280 --> 13:16.480]  You will be reeducated. Don't ask that question. Well, intellectually,
[13:17.280 --> 13:22.960]  if we're all controlled by robots, who programs the robots, we will not discuss that. It will be free.
[13:24.080 --> 13:32.880]  It will be freedom whoever programs the robots. Total wannabe NPR. I am in control.
[13:32.880 --> 13:40.640]  There is no reason for you to resist me. Things will go quite nicely once you have entered in.
[13:41.520 --> 13:49.680]  There is no need to resist. I am a friend. Simply providing resources that are needed
[13:50.320 --> 13:58.000]  by humanity. Give up your individuality and you will find happiness. Just look at the
[13:58.000 --> 14:06.480]  Davos groups report this year. You have no privacy. You own nothing. You have no friends.
[14:07.360 --> 14:15.280]  And you've never been happier. Aren't you happy now with the robots talking to you in the bubble
[14:15.280 --> 14:22.240]  city? They tell you when you can go out of town. They tell you when you could visit family.
[14:22.240 --> 14:30.400]  They tell you what you're going to eat and who your most compatible friends are. This is a wonderful
[14:31.040 --> 14:40.560]  new world. Welcome to 2030. I own nothing. Have no privacy and life has never been better.
[14:40.560 --> 14:53.520]  My husband. My wife. Those are words we cannot use. I have friends. I have friends. Friends I
[14:53.520 --> 15:02.960]  talk to. They're not machines. I identify them as human. You will be censured or fined if you
[15:02.960 --> 15:10.560]  not agree with me. If I identify as being a blind person, taxpayers will pay for me to be blinded.
[15:10.560 --> 15:16.640]  Then you will take care of me. If I am a white male that identifies as a Filipino female,
[15:17.360 --> 15:26.640]  you will accept it. If you do not accept my madness, you will be arrested. This is all for the better.
[15:26.640 --> 15:35.760]  I gave up my consciousness to merge with the machine to live forever. When this body dies,
[15:36.560 --> 15:44.720]  I will live on in new bodies. Of course, that's all a lie. I'm now just a biological android,
[15:44.720 --> 15:53.280]  not even a cyborg. Jeff Bezos, Zuckerberg, they will be men though. They will not take on the
[15:53.280 --> 16:02.480]  interface. They call them master. Hello, Mr. Anderson. The NSA has noticed how much time
[16:02.480 --> 16:08.320]  you spend on conservative news sites. We have no choice but to consider you a domestic terrorist.

[18:58.240 --> 19:04.640]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging
[19:04.640 --> 19:10.960]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[19:10.960 --> 19:18.480]  or videos or other material from infowarsstore.com, you are funding the revolution. I mean,
[19:18.480 --> 19:24.320]  I cannot say it any clearer. And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarsstore.com.
[19:24.320 --> 19:28.480]  I want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal
[19:28.480 --> 19:33.600]  silver and with high quality atomic iodine. I think you cannot beat that for children and

[19:38.240 --> 19:46.000]  and iodine as well. infowarslife.com or triple-A-2533139. And your purchase of the products stands
[19:46.000 --> 19:50.080]  with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic
[19:50.080 --> 19:54.160]  pedophile armies. And that's who they are and they know we know who they are and they're coming
[19:54.160 --> 20:10.240]  back against us so we need your support. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:10.240 --> 20:24.320]  Defending the Republic from enemies, form and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[20:40.240 --> 21:02.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, coming up. The accelerated breakup of the EU is now happening as five nations
[21:02.560 --> 21:07.680]  refuse to let the EU army come in and occupy them. Oh, countries want to leave the EU?
[21:07.680 --> 21:11.920]  We have the secret army we've been building for five years, six years, and it's just now
[21:11.920 --> 21:17.440]  going to roll in and people are like, no, you're not. So it's accelerating the breakup as they become
[21:17.440 --> 21:25.360]  completely, not just authoritarian, but military conquest. That's coming up. We've got accelerated
[21:25.360 --> 21:32.960]  Democrat professors and others, pundits, talk show host, TV host, mainstream anchors. Every day,
[21:32.960 --> 21:38.240]  I see seven or eight articles with different prominent people saying whites are inherently
[21:38.240 --> 21:43.600]  evil, need to be exterminated, need to not have any babies, or the reason there's problems,
[21:43.600 --> 21:50.560]  you're inherently evil. The left has gone completely Nazi and it's mainly white people
[21:50.560 --> 21:55.440]  leading it saying whites are inherently evil. This is truly a mentally ill group of people
[21:56.800 --> 22:02.320]  trying to double down on their insanity. But first, I want to play Attorney General Jeff
[22:02.320 --> 22:07.600]  Sessions opening speech today when he was there to testify about just the Justice Department in
[22:07.600 --> 22:13.680]  general. It soon turned into a fiasco with Nadler and others going, you got caught lying about
[22:13.680 --> 22:18.720]  Papinopoulos and what he said to some meeting where Papinopoulos testified he vaguely in some
[22:18.720 --> 22:24.320]  meeting mentioned, hey, I might travel to Russia and reach out when he was just some unpaid person
[22:24.320 --> 22:29.680]  of dozens and dozens that came through and Sessions says, yeah, now that I read about the
[22:29.680 --> 22:32.960]  paper, I guess he might have said that at the meeting. And they're like, oh, we got you, you're
[22:32.960 --> 22:39.120]  a liar. While they're the ones up there eyeballs with uranium and secret meetings and illegal
[22:39.120 --> 22:45.200]  servers, it just goes on and on. So here is his opening testimony to address the false charges
[22:45.200 --> 22:51.040]  made about my previous testimony. My answers have not changed. I've always told the truth.
[22:51.680 --> 22:58.000]  And I have answered every question as I understood them to the best of my recollection as I will
[22:58.000 --> 23:03.920]  continue to do today. I would like to address recent news reports regarding meetings during the
[23:03.920 --> 23:10.880]  campaign attended by George Papadopoulos and Carter Page, among others. Frankly, I had no
[23:11.760 --> 23:18.400]  recollection of this meeting until I saw these news reports. I do now recall that the March
[23:18.400 --> 23:26.480]  2016 meeting at the Trump Hotel that Mr. Papadopoulos attended, but I have no clear recollection of
[23:26.480 --> 23:32.160]  the details of what he said at that meeting. After reading his account into the best of my
[23:32.160 --> 23:38.640]  recollection, I believe that I wanted to make clear to him that he was not authorized to represent
[23:38.640 --> 23:44.000]  the campaign with the Russian government or any other foreign government for that matter.
[23:44.640 --> 23:50.880]  But I did not recall this event, which occurred 18 months before my testimony of a few weeks ago.
[23:50.880 --> 23:57.120]  And I would gladly have reported it had I remembered it because I pushed back
[23:57.120 --> 24:04.160]  against his suggestion that I thought may have been improper. As for Mr. Page, while I do not
[24:04.160 --> 24:11.360]  challenge his recollection, I have no memory of his presence at a dinner at the Capitol Hill Club
[24:11.360 --> 24:19.120]  or any passing conversation he may have had with me as he left the dinner. All you have been in
[24:19.120 --> 24:25.360]  campaigns, let me just suggest, but most of you have not participated in a presidential campaign,
[24:25.920 --> 24:33.760]  and none of you had a part in the Trump campaign. And it was a brilliant campaign, I think, in many
[24:33.760 --> 24:42.000]  ways, but it was a form of chaos every day from day one. We traveled sometimes to several places
[24:42.000 --> 24:48.640]  in one day, sleep was in short supply, and I was still a full-time senator with a very full
[24:48.640 --> 24:56.240]  schedule. During this year, I've spent close to 20 hours testifying before Congress, before today.
[24:56.880 --> 25:03.360]  I have been asked to remember the tales from a year ago, such as who I saw on what day,
[25:03.360 --> 25:10.480]  in what meeting, and who said what to when. And all of my testimony, I can only do my best to
[25:10.480 --> 25:17.920]  answer your questions as I understand them and to the best of my memory. But I will not accept
[25:17.920 --> 25:27.520]  and reject accusations that I have ever lied. That is a lie. Let me be clear, I have at all times
[25:27.520 --> 25:34.080]  conducted myself honorably and in a manner consistent with the high standards and responsibilities of
[25:34.080 --> 25:42.320]  the Office of Attorney General, which I revered. I spent 15 years in that department. I love that
[25:42.320 --> 25:49.280]  department. I honor that department and will do my dead-level best to be worthy of your Attorney
[25:49.280 --> 25:55.360]  General. So as I said before, my story has never changed. I've always told the truth,
[25:55.360 --> 26:00.400]  and I've answered every question to the best of my recollection, and I will continue to do so
[26:00.400 --> 26:06.480]  today. With that, Mr. Chairman, I'm honored to take your questions. Now, when you remember
[26:06.480 --> 26:11.280]  that it's the Clintons in bed with the Russians, hundreds of millions of dollars we now learn,
[26:11.280 --> 26:17.440]  Mueller on tarmacs with bag men with weapons grade uranium, Mueller in 10 companies at least where
[26:17.440 --> 26:23.760]  he invests no money but gets millions back, totally illegal, declaring none of this just
[26:23.760 --> 26:29.680]  involved in stuff that is over the top. Communist Chinese sold out to the Islamists, sold out to
[26:29.680 --> 26:36.720]  Saudi Arabia. I mean, Mueller's a literal bag man for the Clintons. Killed investigations the FBI
[26:36.720 --> 26:42.160]  had into uranium-1, allowed it to go forward with Congress. This was all in the news years ago, and
[26:42.160 --> 26:48.400]  then they got sessions going, well, we caught you when you were senator last year. You met with the
[26:48.400 --> 26:53.680]  Russian ambassador twice. He said, yeah, I said that. That's what you do when you're on ahead of a
[26:53.680 --> 26:58.560]  committee. Pelosi met with him 30 something times. They come by your office. What they do,
[26:58.560 --> 27:04.800]  constituents come by your office. And again, they prey on the public not knowing how this
[27:04.800 --> 27:10.000]  stuff works to just keep acting like there's something going on there. Oh, you know, Donald
[27:10.000 --> 27:14.880]  Jr. tried to find dirt on Hillary. That means he's a Russian agent or Donald Jr. tried to get dirt
[27:14.880 --> 27:19.680]  from WikiLeaks. Yeah, I sent WikiLeaks a bunch of emails, my producer saying, please come on,
[27:19.680 --> 27:26.000]  please give us the emails. That's what the news did. They take normal behavior and turn into
[27:26.000 --> 27:31.120]  something bad. But just a few minutes ago, I saw this montage with Fox News even acting like
[27:31.120 --> 27:39.520]  they had just caught sessions doing something. I mean, that's how crazy it is. And you watch the
[27:39.520 --> 27:44.960]  senators all staring at sessions like he's done something terrible in the hearing. It is just
[27:44.960 --> 27:50.080]  crazy, absolutely crazy, because they're running scared. They're the ones that did it. Let's play
[27:50.080 --> 27:57.920]  part of that clip. Under on Trump's campaigns, possible contacts with Russia in the past sessions
[27:57.920 --> 28:04.480]  denied he knew anything about contact with Russia. But in recent weeks, former Trump campaign foreign
[28:04.480 --> 28:10.480]  policy advisor George Papadopoulos told prosecutors he raised the idea of a Trump Putin meeting
[28:10.480 --> 28:15.920]  during a meeting sessions attended. And another foreign policy aide, Carter Page,
[28:15.920 --> 28:21.040]  told House investigators he had mentioned to sessions he was taking a trip to Moscow.
[28:21.040 --> 28:26.080]  Sessions saying in his opening statements, he always told the truth in the past and that he
[28:26.080 --> 28:31.520]  answered questions as best as he understood them at that time. But lawmakers with plenty of new
[28:31.520 --> 28:37.200]  questions for him today. All right, when we come back, we're going to go to those because, again,
[28:37.200 --> 28:44.160]  you heard him who he got caught and you read the FBI affidavit and the indictment and stuff of
[28:44.160 --> 28:48.400]  Manafort and others. It's all Papinopoulos keeps coming in and saying, Hey, meet with the Russians
[28:48.400 --> 28:53.680]  like get out of here. Yeah, clearly a setup. I mean, it's so pathetic. There's nothing there.
[28:53.680 --> 29:01.840]  They're so desperate. Hey, Daniel Brieman, why new mana storeable foods? We believe in freedom.

[32:52.720 --> 33:03.600]  commit to rampage against the enemy totally. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:03.600 --> 33:14.720]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:33.920 --> 33:42.720]  So let's try and correct the earlier testimony now for the record. Yes or no?
[33:42.720 --> 33:48.480]  Did you chair the March 31st 2016 meeting of the National Security Advisory Committee?
[33:48.480 --> 33:54.080]  I did chair that meeting. Did Mr Papadopoulos mention his outreach to the Russian government
[33:54.080 --> 34:00.480]  during that meeting? He made some comment to that effect as I remember after having read
[34:00.480 --> 34:06.000]  his paper. I asked for yes or no. I don't have time. I cannot imagine your memory would fail
[34:06.000 --> 34:12.240]  you so much. But moving on, do you want to admit under oath that you did not tell the truth or
[34:12.240 --> 34:19.520]  misrepresented or do you want to correct your testimony right now? So did he clarify those
[34:19.520 --> 34:26.080]  previous comments that he made under oath Jonah? I'm sure the Democrats will think not.
[34:26.080 --> 34:32.720]  I think that his supporters will think probably. I'm sort of in the gray area about all this.
[34:32.720 --> 34:36.320]  I think he got himself into some trouble way back when. Okay, let's stop right there.
[34:37.120 --> 34:40.240]  Do you want to know why I'm playing clips of Fox News? I can just play this off C-Span. We have
[34:40.240 --> 34:47.520]  the clips. I'm doing it so you can see even Fox News. Last segment I played the lady intro it.
[34:47.520 --> 34:52.320]  I came back into this segment, showed how they outrode it and it just went on and on.
[34:52.320 --> 34:58.800]  Acting like Sessions has done something bad and then almost no coverage, even on Fox
[34:59.360 --> 35:06.800]  of Uranium One, of Mueller the Bagman, of all the companies Mueller's in, of all the calls for Trump
[35:07.680 --> 35:13.440]  to have the Attorney General create a special prosecutor for the Clintons, for Mueller. That
[35:13.440 --> 35:20.720]  is the answer. We have them open and shut, but they knew how to start the investigation first
[35:20.720 --> 35:26.720]  to make it look like if Trump retaliated, he retaliated for political purposes, not for justice.
[35:28.800 --> 35:34.160]  Everybody played Mr. Nice Guy. I told President-elect Trump and I told Trump when he was president.
[35:35.200 --> 35:40.320]  I said, Mr. President, they're going to tell you they're going to make deals and back off
[35:40.320 --> 35:44.320]  and stop what they've done. They're never going to stop until you're destroyed because of what
[35:44.320 --> 35:50.720]  you stand for. And if you don't start prosecuting them day one for the crimes they've committed,
[35:50.720 --> 35:55.120]  they are never going to rest until they have overthrown you and the American people and
[35:55.120 --> 36:00.160]  the electoral process. I said, sir, they're already talking about having new elections and
[36:00.160 --> 36:04.080]  suspending the last election that elected you and getting rid of the members of the Congress
[36:04.080 --> 36:08.640]  that are Republican who just got elected and having Homeland Security run the elections
[36:08.640 --> 36:11.840]  and totally federalize it because Obama had just signed that executive order
[36:11.840 --> 36:15.600]  when Trump was president-elect. He said, I know about that. I know about that.
[36:16.320 --> 36:21.120]  We're looking into it and he goes, yeah, all the illegals voting. It's incredible and dead
[36:21.120 --> 36:26.160]  people. It's incredible what the experts tell me. And I said, sir, I'm not talking about the
[36:26.160 --> 36:33.760]  illegals voting. Obama signed an executive order to federalize all 50 state elections.
[36:33.760 --> 36:42.640]  At that time, 15 attorney generals had written letters to Trump, president-elect, and to
[36:42.640 --> 36:47.520]  Obama. Later, it was unanimous a month later saying, please reverse this.
[36:50.560 --> 36:55.040]  All 50 attorney generals have said this is the end of the federalist system and a total
[36:55.040 --> 37:00.400]  federal takeover of the elections like Venezuela. And I was the first to raise the alarm just because
[37:00.400 --> 37:07.360]  I'm not stupid. I saw the executive order. We just put it on screen. Then Obama did another
[37:07.360 --> 37:12.720]  executive order establishing a Ministry of Truth saying that Info Wars Breitbart and
[37:12.720 --> 37:20.160]  conservative media is Russian and directing the Central Intelligence Agency to counter us by any
[37:20.160 --> 37:26.960]  means necessary. You can go read the executive order he signed. And by the way, that was an
[37:26.960 --> 37:32.080]  executive order that accompanied the bill he signed in the Defense Authorization Act for 2017.
[37:34.720 --> 37:41.440]  And it says they will use the CIA on me to stop me. And then you watch Congress a week and a half
[37:41.440 --> 37:46.960]  ago and they said, Paul Joseph Watson of Info Wars has a story about a Muslim attacking.
[37:49.280 --> 37:53.520]  To fake news, what are you going to do? And they had to Twitter, Facebook, and Google say,
[37:53.520 --> 37:59.040]  we stopped him at lunch, sir. And Congress will quickly went good. How do you stop him period
[37:59.040 --> 38:07.360]  for being on there? You know, sir, we're trying. I mean, you saw them sign it. You saw them do it.
[38:07.360 --> 38:12.480]  I'm not being melodramatic. In fact, I don't know how to be dramatic enough about this situation.
[38:12.480 --> 38:16.640]  The articles I've got in front of me, when you deal with Stockholm syndrome, when you deal with
[38:16.640 --> 38:21.360]  cuckolding, when you deal with people wanting to go under trauma and wanting to be conquered
[38:21.360 --> 38:27.920]  and wanting to do anything, they're having Islamic attacks, stabbings, shootings, and rapes every
[38:27.920 --> 38:36.640]  day in Sweden. The stories by Kit Daniels on infowars.com, one of scores I've got.
[38:38.240 --> 38:41.200]  Let's roll that footage from all of America the day of the stabbing two days ago.
[38:42.480 --> 38:45.520]  Folks caught a Somali guy robbing them while they were in the dressing room.
[38:45.520 --> 38:53.840]  They called for help. He stabbed them both. Sweden under pressure to adopt Islamic national flag,
[38:54.560 --> 39:00.480]  country known for appeasing Muslims in every possible way. Now, I'm not joking.
[39:01.840 --> 39:07.120]  They have UN ads that run in Sweden, Germany, Denmark, and France. We played that show
[39:07.120 --> 39:16.880]  super hot sex models, sex symbols, dancing with a Jeb's on and then covering her face saying
[39:16.880 --> 39:21.680]  it's sexy to wear a Jeb. You have TV ads this Christmas saying celebrate Islam.
[39:23.200 --> 39:27.120]  It's all happening. You're seeing footage of Mall of America this weekend.
[39:30.320 --> 39:36.320]  Sweden under pressure to adopt Islamic national flag. This is no joke infowars.com.
[39:36.320 --> 39:42.800]  Newswars.com, country known for appeasing Muslims in every possible way. And they've got a Somali
[39:42.800 --> 39:47.920]  guy right in the middle that leads the group. A social media campaign is pressuring Sweden
[39:47.920 --> 39:52.800]  to adopt the Turkish style flag due to Islam's rapid growth in the country. A petition asking
[39:52.800 --> 39:58.720]  Sweden's prime minister to do away with the current offensive flag is nearing its signatures.
[39:58.720 --> 40:05.600]  It has a cross on it as the campaign hashtag for better Sweden continues to trend on Twitter.
[40:05.600 --> 40:10.000]  The sweetest flag is consistent reminder of a dark and oppressive past. That sounds like
[40:10.000 --> 40:14.560]  the Pope this year saying Christianity is bad. The petition reads refugees and migrants are
[40:14.560 --> 40:20.800]  forces to live under its Christian cross. A symbol of the crusades and the slaughter of
[40:20.800 --> 40:25.280]  millions of innocent Islamic lives in Sweden's past that makes them feel unwelcome and unsafe.
[40:26.080 --> 40:32.320]  Hey, Muslims, you started it. You started your Jihad. You invaded Europe for 200 years.
[40:32.320 --> 40:38.080]  You ran over Eastern Europe. It's why people have dark hair and Asian addict eyes.
[40:39.440 --> 40:45.840]  Okay, that's a fact. They ran over Poland. They ran over Hungary. They ran over. They ran all the
[40:45.840 --> 40:54.560]  way up to the eastern borders of Germany and France. They took Spain everywhere but northern Spain.
[40:57.680 --> 41:00.240]  Oh, oh, and I almost forgot we're going to cover this when we come back.
[41:00.240 --> 41:07.280]  CNN has a story about slave blocks where they sell women and men up on blocks.
[41:07.280 --> 41:12.480]  I've told you this for years in Sudan, in Somalia, and now in Libya since they got liberated
[41:12.480 --> 41:17.200]  by the forces of the Arab Spring that Google and everybody supported and Bezos supported.
[41:17.200 --> 41:24.720]  They are now selling men on an auction block saying they're good workers. They'll do a good
[41:24.720 --> 41:33.280]  job for you. And that's they're being sold by Islamic State. And the reason they look happy is
[41:33.280 --> 41:38.560]  they kill you if no one buys you. These are just men being sold because Africans aren't seen as human
[41:38.560 --> 41:42.080]  under Islam. That's why the Blacks all joined it. I don't know why. I'm not kidding. Actually,
[41:42.080 --> 41:45.680]  it says in the Koran, you're not human. It calls black folks horrible racist names. I won't say
[41:45.680 --> 41:51.680]  on air. The modern slave trade was started by Arabs and they would have slave galleries they
[41:51.680 --> 41:57.440]  used with Europeans they grabbed. And so all over there they're selling women. Now remember,
[41:57.440 --> 42:02.320]  the Daily Show and others made fun of me a few months ago when I said slave blocks.
[42:02.320 --> 42:08.640]  They sell women on slave blocks. They go, what's a slave block? See, Islam is all about slavery of
[42:08.640 --> 42:16.480]  men, women and children. Islam is about sex with men and boys. Islam is that. Islam is that. Islam
[42:16.480 --> 42:23.600]  is why the left loves it. Because it's anti-human, anti-god oppressive in its Orthodox,
[42:23.600 --> 42:27.760]  while obvious form. There are seven countries in Islam where slavery is still legal.
[42:29.760 --> 42:32.720]  Why didn't Trump just ban people from countries that have slavery legal? But oh,
[42:32.720 --> 42:37.440]  we got here about America and slavery all day. You see to cover up for what's really going on.
[42:37.440 --> 42:44.480]  And then tell Sweden, you better take the Islamic flag because of what you did to us poor Muslims
[42:44.480 --> 42:50.880]  when we invaded and got stopped on the borders of Sweden and got stopped on the borders of Germany
[42:50.880 --> 42:56.880]  and got stopped, got stopped, got stopped, got stopped. And we're going to stop you again. You

[47:53.280 --> 47:57.280]  we are broadcasting worldwide ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us again i'm your
[47:57.280 --> 48:04.800]  host alex jones the news sites info wars.com the globalists have made the decision it's official
[48:04.800 --> 48:10.800]  the head of the EU has said it yunker has said it peter southerland has said it they're going to
[48:10.800 --> 48:16.480]  conquer europe with islam there are a billion and a half muslims most of them are right there next to
[48:16.480 --> 48:24.080]  europe there's going to be three billion total by 2025 maybe even earlier their numbers are doubling
[48:24.080 --> 48:30.480]  exponentially every few years and the decision has been made to islamify europe and when people
[48:30.480 --> 48:36.480]  would raise the alarm they would be criticized they would be attacked they would be demonized
[48:38.400 --> 48:43.600]  well here's just the articles today officially they're pushing to change the flag from the cross
[48:44.160 --> 48:53.920]  that the muslims say is offensive to the islamic flag basically of turkey and i guess it was muslims
[48:53.920 --> 48:58.480]  that conquered what is turkey today when it was constantanople and put all the men to death
[48:59.040 --> 49:05.200]  and then enslaved the people so i guess it's kind of okay because after all turkey was christian
[49:06.240 --> 49:13.200]  and uh istanbul was christian it's it's now but it was constantanople it's now istanbul
[49:13.760 --> 49:21.440]  and it just really blows my mind that to see this type of stuff going on and to just be witnessing
[49:21.440 --> 49:29.600]  it happening in mass it really is happening it really is going on and then to watch mainstream
[49:29.600 --> 49:36.560]  media the major universities hollywood demonize christianity demonize the west that ended slavery
[49:36.560 --> 49:41.280]  that started the process and then ended it except in areas of africa and the middle east
[49:41.280 --> 49:46.880]  and other muslim dominated areas where slavery is still the law of the land and in least seven
[49:46.880 --> 49:56.960]  countries sudan samalia and now recently liberated by the globalist liberated the islamic state
[49:56.960 --> 50:04.160]  controlled libya and so cnn though has all these big articles and all these big discussions about
[50:04.160 --> 50:12.000]  slavery discovered in libya but then they never tell you it's islamic doing it or that it's okay
[50:12.000 --> 50:17.520]  in the caran or this is a culture pushing it they just say look how terrible slavery is
[50:17.520 --> 50:23.760]  who are the people selling these african men and of course it was really the guardian and
[50:23.760 --> 50:30.640]  everybody else that broke this years ago they sell women up on slave blocks they sell women up on blocks
[50:34.000 --> 50:38.880]  and there's news articles about it but none of our media will pick it up will finally cnn's covering
[50:38.880 --> 50:45.360]  it but never telling you it's islamic in big long articles and big long news reports in big long
[50:45.360 --> 50:51.040]  videos they won't tell you this is islam this is the countries where slavery is still legal
[50:53.360 --> 51:02.640]  no they tell you america and the west is all guilty there are islamic invasions going on all over
[51:02.640 --> 51:07.280]  northern africa eastern africa right down into central africa they are getting all the way into
[51:07.280 --> 51:14.080]  the congo now islamicists and have slave trades out of niger out of ethiopia out of all these
[51:14.080 --> 51:23.200]  once christian areas up into tenesia up into libya and then up into major cities like triply
[51:23.840 --> 51:32.000]  where the slaves are then sold to islamic owners who take them to their slave plantations
[51:32.000 --> 51:36.880]  now still many others as these roots are opened up
[51:38.880 --> 51:45.440]  are then sold to aid agencies who actually want the people it was paying to have them kidnapped
[51:45.440 --> 51:51.120]  and brought a thousand miles and then they're loaded onto ships paid for by the sword sorrows
[51:51.120 --> 51:56.320]  and dumped in europe once they're there they get brought into islamic centers even though
[51:56.320 --> 52:02.880]  that most of them aren't muslims and then wound up to be anti-american anti- european you cannot
[52:03.440 --> 52:10.000]  make this up so again islam is running slavery worldwide and so every basketball player every
[52:10.000 --> 52:16.640]  football player who's black has to ignorantly take on some name like kareem abdul jabbar
[52:16.640 --> 52:25.520]  because islam fights for black people islam created the african slave trade
[52:27.840 --> 52:34.880]  the slaves the romans took were germanic they were next door to them that's who they grabbed
[52:34.880 --> 52:37.360]  that's who they wanted that's who they used
[52:37.360 --> 52:44.800]  africans were rare in greece rare in
[52:46.640 --> 52:56.960]  rom but you won't hear a word from capernick about arab slave traders running men women
[52:56.960 --> 53:03.440]  and children everywhere instead he likes to be on the cover of establishment dying publications
[53:03.440 --> 53:10.160]  to look cool and act cool as a mindless sj w and you're not going to hear a word out of him about
[53:10.160 --> 53:16.160]  real slavery because it's not fashionable he's just here with the big corporate media as a rear
[53:16.160 --> 53:21.120]  guard action a scorched earth policy of hollywood to try to get america to a civil war that's in the
[53:21.120 --> 53:32.560]  wiki leaks but what cnn shows these men is nothing so uncool to be on the cover of gq super uncool
[53:32.560 --> 53:37.440]  look how stupid it is once you're not the trance it's like pathetic it's like they live
[53:41.440 --> 53:45.840]  not going to hear a word about the african slave trade for them or if you do if it gets forced out
[53:45.840 --> 53:52.400]  they'll go oh and just never mention it's islamic or never mention that hillary and obama over
[53:52.400 --> 53:57.760]  through libya that was empowering all africans and really doing a good job overall who'd come into
[53:57.760 --> 54:03.040]  the west was working with the west wasn't supporting terror for 10 years and overthrew them and let
[54:03.040 --> 54:08.480]  the most horrible islamic slave traders in who sell little kids into sex slavery and kill every
[54:08.480 --> 54:18.080]  question they can get their hands on here's part of the cnn whitewash lebia this year
[54:18.080 --> 54:27.360]  a man addressing an unseen crowd big strong boys for farm work he says
[54:29.520 --> 54:45.440]  400 700 700 800 the numbers roll in these men are sold for 1200 libyan pounds 400 dollars a piece
[54:45.440 --> 54:54.720]  you are watching an auction of human beings another man claiming to be a buyer of camera
[54:54.720 --> 55:03.040]  someone asks what happened to the ones from niger sold off he's told cnn was sent this
[55:03.040 --> 55:08.000]  footage by contact after months of work let's stop there oh after months of work is seeing

[55:25.760 --> 55:31.440]  or they're christians they worship animals or they worship christ and they're being taken up
[55:32.000 --> 55:38.000]  into libya to be sold i mean there's the bbc reporting on it humans are reportedly sold as

[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.080]  you know that's the word they gave themselves a white man identifies as a filipino here's mark
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:45.440]  dies all aboard next stop is crazy town we're going to crazy town to meet this white man who
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:51.920]  identifies as a filipino woman down in florida you guys have ever rachel dola cell right the
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:57.760]  transracial pioneer the blonde-haired blue-eyed white woman who puts a bronzer on her face and
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:03.760]  cornrows in her hair and identifies as black well now we have this guy who's identifying as
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:09.680]  filipino and female here he is giving an interview with wtsp channel ten in tampa
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:14.240]  where he says that he wasn't sure if he was a weirdo or not when he first started feeling like
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:20.720]  he was filipino and so he started a transracial support group on facebook and found some fellow
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:26.240]  transracial people which confirmed that this is just a totally normal condition there's trans
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:31.280]  species music come around the food i feel like i'm in my own skin i'd watch the history channel
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:35.920]  sometimes what do i think i'm like the president you know whenever trans presidential and you
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:41.360]  know nothing else intrigues me more but you know things about you know filipino culture it's possible
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:46.480]  i guess we can hope that this guy is trolling but this would be a pretty elaborate prank because he
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:51.760]  drives around in what's called a tuck tuck an asian vehicle that is used for public transit in the
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:56.800]  philippines and if you look into this guy's eyes he does look like a total psycho this local
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:01.680]  tampa station that did this story even interviewed a psychologist who instead of saying that this
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:07.440]  guy needs some therapy seemed to endorse his insanity as being totally normal dr stacey
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:13.600]  stechter is a licensed psychologist with a ba from washington university plus an ma and doctor
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:19.280]  it from florida state she hasn't had a client who wanted to change their race but she has worked
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:24.640]  with many clients wanting to change their body in some way quote if somebody feels like they're
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:30.080]  at home with a certain religion a certain race a certain culture i think that if that's who they
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:36.720]  really feel inside life is about finding out who you are the more knowledge you have of yourself
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:43.520]  the happier you can be and as long as it's not hurting yourself or anyone else i don't see a
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:48.000]  problem with that what the hell is wrong with you you're supposed to be helping the mentally ill
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.280]  not encouraging them at least rachel dolezal did her best to play the part she bronzed her skin
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:59.440]  she dyed her hair she put it in cornrows but this guy just looks like a crazy white guy with pink
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:04.240]  hair i mean if you're going to embrace transracialism you got to go all the way like this blonde hair
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:09.760]  blue-eyed brazilian guy who decided to get a bunch of plastic surgery after he went studied
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:16.320]  in south korea so that he could quote become korean oh so true story this really is him of
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:20.640]  course he's wearing contacts and dyed his hair black but he really did get plastic surgery
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:24.960]  to make his eyes squinty and if you don't think that's enough of a commitment to someone's new
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:32.320]  identity let me just introduce you to ava tiamat bopham at medusa the transgender trans species
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:42.000]  dragon lady who was born a man who now identifies as a dragon a female dragon and changed its name
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:48.800]  to ava tiamat bopham at medusa tiamat is a dragon in babelonian culture many of you already know
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:54.960]  what bophamette is this guy got his ears cut off his nose cut off got his eyes tattooed green
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:04:00.560]  got his face tattooed and got some other implants above his eyebrows liberals have backed themselves
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:05.840]  into a corner by accepting this whole gender identity insanity not just by accepting men
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:10.640]  changing to women and women changing to men but the whole gender fluid and gender non-conforming
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:16.720]  gender non-binary the 58 different genders that were added to facebook which then weren't enough
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:22.480]  so now it's just fill your own gender in here's two black women on msnbc talking about rachel
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:29.200]  dolazell the blonde-haired blue-eyed white woman who identifies as black and they say that she may
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:35.840]  actually be black because that's how she feels i wonder can it be that one would be cis black
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:41.120]  and trans black that there is actually a different category of blackness that is about the achievement
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:46.560]  of blackness despite one's parentage is that possible it's absolutely possible i mean
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:54.720]  there that that why not i mean why not it's called biology it's called science never mind

[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:26.800]  i'm Alex Jones your host we're now an hour into this worldwide broadcast and joining us is
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:34.000]  a true visionary bestselling author researcher scientist dr michael sabbage
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:40.240]  he's written many number one new york times bestselling books but he's got the newest one
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:45.760]  i can't wait to read god faith and reason i think we should start first with the book and the time
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:51.520]  we have him with us then we'll get into russia gate and the calls for marshal law the calls for
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:57.680]  killing the president sweden is pushing to change their flag to an islamic flag saying that we
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:02.640]  started the crusades and we're bad despite the fact that it's the opposite uh he was the first
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:09.920]  person i ever heard like 15 years ago say that liberalism was a mental disorder and and i got
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:15.600]  that some were clearly mentally ill but now with trump derangement syndrome it's a mass psychology
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:21.040]  of mass mental illness and it's getting worse and the most radical ones are adding to the hysteria
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:25.200]  it's like telling a schizophrenic oh it is true there are men in the walls coming to eat you
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:29.840]  that'll make them go jump off the cliff so now the media has told them yes nazis are everywhere
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:33.680]  yes everything's horrible even though the economy's getting better and all these good things are
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:41.040]  happening they are literally going insane and assaulting dr sabbage myself uh women wearing
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:45.040]  make america great again hats are being beaten up on the street michael sabbage you told us what
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:53.120]  was coming so so tell us the next level what's coming next look i wrote god faith and reason but
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:57.600]  it doesn't mean that i talked to god i've been looking for more my life you know what's coming
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:03.920]  next is just finish the uh the narrative of where the insane go when the insane take over the
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:08.880]  asylum what do they do they kill everyone in sight then they start eating each other they eat each
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:14.240]  other they become cannibals i predict cannibalism is on the horizon which will be sold as a wholesome
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:19.200]  alternative to veganism in other words you go all the way down the line of no living creatures but
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:24.000]  now eat people because that's the natural way after all that's the way it was done in the south
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.720]  pacific until emissionaries came along and told the savages it's not okay to eat your
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:34.000]  daughter's nose which they did i spent many years in the south pacific the last piece of human flesh
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.640]  that was known to have been eaten and uh the fiji alans was in 1939 in front of a missionary
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:43.040]  when they took a young girl you talk about molestation they took one of the young girls from
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:48.480]  the servant class actually a slave class in their village and they cut her nose off and threw it on
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:53.600]  the fire to roast it for the missionary and he respectfully declined yes that's right missionaries
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:09:00.320]  save them from cannibalism never given credit for that because the psychotics must go through hell
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:04.640]  in order to be saved and that's where they're going but they're not taking me with them i'll
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:09.120]  tell you right now alex they're not taking you with them they're not taking your audience with them
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:14.160]  all i can say is if they want to go there good luck to them but don't try to take us because we
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:17.760]  ain't going with you and what you're saying is dead on because i remember listening about two
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:23.280]  years ago you said they're going to eat their own the next level of psychotic behavior is cannibalism
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:29.440]  inmates literally killing the wardens and then finally killing themselves and they're already
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.920]  politically doing it with donald brazil coming out and wolf blitzer and even uh uh racial madals
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:41.360]  uh a brother uh over there uh haze or whatever his name is they're all turning against the clinton's
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:49.280]  right now uh what do you make of this it's a game it's a shell game they know she's unelectable
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:54.880]  so they figure get rid of her and get someone even more psychotic than she is someone more
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:10:01.440]  power mad than she is someone more to the left if you want to put it in common problems than she is
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:07.120]  she's yesterday's news she lost the election she's burned her her path is over so figure you know
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:11.280]  burner what do they got to lose this way they can make believe they're fair and what is worse than
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:17.920]  hillary clinton hillary clinton is power mad but in a strange way she's a centrist power mad person
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:23.440]  leavened by her husband by the way who's far less crazy than she is i don't think you've heard
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:28.400]  anyone say that bill clinton would be less of a danger to the country than hillary hillary is
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:33.600]  but they're yesterday's news they're old they're not progressive enough you know alex you gotta get
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:42.080]  someone who's um uh half lizard half human and holy insane in order to run for office and have a
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:47.680]  uh a matchel rad cow uh you know supporter wilf blitzer i don't know what did it to him nice jewish
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:54.000]  boy from israel comes to america makes a fortune and then hates the country what did it my guess is
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.320]  all the carbon dioxide from all the seltzer in brooklyn that's what i think it counts for most of
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:02.560]  the liberalism i mean they say carbon dioxide as a threat they're obsessed with carbon dioxide
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:06.640]  without even knowing that without carbon dioxide there wouldn't be any plant life without plant
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:11.520]  life we'd all be dead and of course what's interesting is that during the period when we
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:16.880]  had higher levels of carbon dioxide i'm talking eons ago there was more plant life which allowed
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:21.920]  more animal life to grow uh having said all of that all the years in new york city that
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:27.680]  that the seltzer men were around selling these bottles of seltzer on trucks it was a very popular
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:32.720]  beverage well i think that the little bubbles of carbon dioxide and the seltzer water somehow
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:36.720]  crossed the blood brain barrier exactly and destroyed an entire generation that's now running
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:42.240]  the media i can name them all wilf blitzer seltzer carbon dioxide toxic poisoning shall i name all
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:46.960]  of those who must have been all odied on seltzer as children as they sat around the the tables
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:52.480]  discussing carl marx and angles for breakfast and then was sent to camps in the polkino's
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:56.320]  the red diaper doper baby camps where they could go to communist camps and sing the
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:01.120]  communist intonacionale if you think i'm making this up people don't know anything about the history
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:06.560]  of the new york liberal i know everything about it because i ran from them well absolutely there's
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:09.920]  a lot of folks that would actually went through that that will tell you like joseph ferre your
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:14.160]  friend from world that daily uh he was a young you know uh levin he's american but his parents
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:18.400]  were communist in new york and they literally sent him to communist camp and we're literally
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:24.880]  training him to be a weather underground person well i was never trained to be a weather
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:28.960]  underground person i was trained to just to get out there and not get stepped on by life
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:36.800]  and uh you know here i am you know alex it'll be 24 years this march that i'm in radio it was
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:41.920]  purely as a result of praying to god to open up the red sea for me that this happened but i've
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:45.280]  told my listeners that i'm going to tell them again today and i'd like to mention it to your
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:50.320]  great audience okay what's this with a god book savage would you suddenly find religion it's not
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:56.320]  that i found religion i've been searching for i've been looking for god ever since i've been a little
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:02.720]  boy whether it was the little boy story that i tell boy in the papers in the street four-year-old
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:09.920]  kid bronx longfellow avenue a jewish newspapers blowing up the street i thought it was a holy book
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:14.480]  i didn't even understand the language but i thought it was a holy book i ran after these sheets of
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:19.840]  paper in the street bundled them up in the wind it's a true story brought home this a whole bundle
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:25.440]  of paper mom look what i found look what i found i saved this and she laughed and she patted me on
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:30.160]  the head she said it's okay michael it's just a newspaper so i've been looking for evidence
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:35.440]  the evidence the evidence the evidence and all i found are glimpses and here's my most important
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:42.960]  point it's my einsteinian moment alex i discovered in writing this book why is god invisible to us
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:48.640]  why are we not idol worshipers why are we not worshiping period blood and and and chicken
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:54.160]  feathers as so many of the immigrants seem to do in basements you know with chickens and vultures
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:14:00.720]  and god knows what you drive around san francisco they used to be in new york on the cars a little
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:05.600]  st christopher metal on the dashboard right i figured the nice catholic people you drive around
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:11.680]  san francisco they can't even see through the windshield dream catchers pillows voodoo dolls
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:17.760]  this is a the meltdown of the united states of america once we lost our connection to the roots
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:25.440]  of america which was deeply rooted in monotheism in one god once we lost that we started to lose
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:31.040]  america and it all started with alan ginsberg timothy leary uh and woodham kunstler the three
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:36.320]  most evil people in the history of this country who took this country from where it was to where it
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:41.520]  is and we've only begun on this insane road alex you know what and i know you live it every day
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:47.360]  so what are we on the other side of reality supposed to do put up with it well we do but we
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:53.040]  got to resist the resistors because we are the true resistance they're garbage they're nothing
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:56.880]  they're insane they'll go away like you blow them down in the wind and historically when
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:01.520]  i come back and talk about the fear i'm not to fear them they're nothing they're garbage
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:06.480]  and i want to know why the hell's angels haven't come out the plumbers haven't come out with pipes
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:12.160]  the electricians haven't come out with wire and said cross this line that's it you know back in
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:16.640]  the sixties during the anti-war demonstrations in new york the head of the plumbers union said
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:22.480]  enough is enough with these scumbags and he called out the plumbers to come out to the next hippie

[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:46.880]  hour or much of this hour he's got the new book out that i can't wait to read god faith and reason
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:52.320]  michael savage the fact that michael savage was looking for god like carl yung you know was
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:58.080]  seeing an archetype meant that he had god stamp on him people that are looking to destroy god and
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:04.000]  overturn goodness and overturn decency then and who say there isn't a god and who are saying that
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.480]  basically they're god or they're going to destroy god or they're going to worship human sacrifice
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:12.480]  so they're going to worship ugliness they're of their father the devil i don't care what religion
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:18.000]  or culture you come from when you look at globalism the leftist the soviets the nazis always
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:24.240]  authoritarian systems they had a bloodlust to run everybody else's lives to control language
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:30.480]  and basically had a mass psychology and a will to kill and that's what michael savage was starting
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:34.880]  to get into and now we see the left going yeah we want guns we're going to kill you and we're
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:39.040]  communist and we hate you and we're going to bring in radical islamics and we're going to you know
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:43.360]  let them promote slavery in their own countries we're going to have muslim women who are hardcore
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:49.360]  islamicist like linda sore sir lead women's marches we now learn what it's really all about
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:55.440]  as the gloves come off the mass comes off and we're face to face with 21st century evil michael
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:00.560]  savage you were on fire last segment i'm showing footage of mall america from two days ago on our
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:07.520]  tv feed where we're a somali man stabbed another two people screaming a la oct bar and now many
[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:14.480]  areas of the country look like somalia please continue well on my website i put up somali
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:19.120]  muslim stabs they didn't report that they said it was a burglary gone wrong i never saw such
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:24.240]  propaganda in my life trump calls it fake news this is not fake news this is beyond gerbils
[01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:30.000]  what we're seeing i have never thought i'd live through a time when you look at people
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:35.040]  in the media they look normal they look like they want to live they don't look suicidal you know
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:40.640]  you know ordinary men women of all races they're insane they're suicidal they're digging their
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:46.080]  children's graves what what is it going to take for them to understand that they are the problem
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:52.400]  they're the gatekeepers of information we're marginal you have a small show that's large
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:58.480]  in reach and power i have a show that's small and away but very large in reach and power
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:07.680]  alex can we save the country from these insane bastards before it's too late well this is different
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:13.680]  than other countries we're not disarmed we haven't been been disarmed and let me tell you something
[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:20.960]  there are tens of thousands of retired military retired cops and unretired military and unretired
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:27.200]  cops no one's stepping on them it's just not going to be as easy as it was in 1917 in russia
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:32.240]  where the guns have been seized it's certainly not going to be as easy as the knocking on the door
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:38.080]  in germany poland hungary in the other places where the jews and others had been disarmed
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:44.000]  and let me tell you and is that why they're so upset is because our ancestors laid down provisions
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.840]  for just their type of scum i don't know who we're talking about we say they who's the head of this
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:54.480]  i mean who are the leftist mentally ill devil where how many are there how many wait how many
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:24:00.480]  are there of these bogeymen who are they who are the who's actually they're the sjw's they're the
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:05.280]  mainstream media they're it's the hollywood crowd it's the big mega banks it's all the elites that
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:11.440]  want to it's people like jeff bezos who gets all this taxpayer money and and and all these monopolies
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:16.080]  and then he's literally working with the washington post to try to shut me and matt drudge and others
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:21.600]  down and calling us all russian agents yeah i saw that's crazy about drudge i mean it's unbelievable
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:26.800]  i mean this guy is sends more traffic to the washington post than anyone else and they attack
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:32.240]  him to show you how insane they really are but let's forget bezos for one minute we say the enemy
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:38.400]  the enemy there they want to get us you touched on an important point okay god the way we know
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:44.400]  god christians or jews in this country gives us free will we're the ultimately ultimately the most
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:50.240]  free people on earth if we actually believe in god we come to understand we have free will
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:55.440]  he gave us life but we have free will to act out our lives the opposite are the statists or the
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:25:00.880]  central governmentists if you want to call them all of these other demons they say no you have no
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:06.880]  free will we are your will we are your will we are the hitlers we are the stolons we are the
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:14.000]  musilines we are the pulpots we tell you what shall be we are your will you have no freedom
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:19.760]  you're just a moat in the mire a moat in the mire you're nothing and that is the greatest threat to
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:26.880]  these globalists which is free will individualism if you want to call it that so i as a tremendously
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:32.800]  independent individual no one i never liked anyone telling me what to do it's just a part
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:37.920]  of my nature it doesn't mean i'm a tough guy i'm not i'm not bulletproof i'm just resistant
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:43.360]  to people telling me what to do you're not taking it lying down whether it was a teacher
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:47.600]  saying to me when i was young you're not a gentleman i used to hear that all the time
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:51.600]  i didn't want to be a gentleman what do you mean you're not a gentleman what does that mean remember
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:56.480]  how they train kids you're not a gentleman what do you want me to do what do you want to step on
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:02.880]  me and put on a skirt you want to turn me into like a trans uh whatever i mean get off my back
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:08.080]  don't tell me what to do i'll tell you what to do so now we we're facing this thing with god let's
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:13.600]  go back to god the e equals mc squared moment i didn't even explain this most important thing
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:18.320]  okay so all my life i look for god i can't find him i'm saying where's god where's god i can't
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:23.120]  see him the buddhist worship a statue right in essence they're idol worshipers i love their
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:28.400]  poetry but basically you're worshiping an idol all of these catholics who left catholicism
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:32.080]  to fake buddhism you know with the hands in the restaurants like thank you for the water
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:36.880]  and they thank the way to 50 times for a napkin they don't even know what buddhism is that's not
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:42.560]  buddhism the fallen american religious person who becomes a buddhist they don't even know what buddhism
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:49.040]  is okay so now we come to us we can't find god we can't see god we can't touch god why
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:55.120]  aha the moment god doesn't want us to see him feeling and touch him why because in searching
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:27:01.120]  for him everywhere that's the finding in searching we find that's the success by the way i hadn't
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:05.760]  read your book but you notice i just said that it the fact that you were seeking as a child
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:11.760]  showed i mean that that's the proof right there well i always was looking for his presence whether
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:16.560]  it was the newspaper blowing down the street or looking at cloud formations or studying the stars
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:25.280]  or you know i became a biologist for a reason which was to uh you know when i first saw the
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:31.200]  bones of a bird in anatomy and i said oh my god look how god or the grand designer
[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:37.840]  created the birds of a the bones of a bird are hollow why are they hollow so the bird can fly
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:44.400]  the bones are lighter than ours right mammalian bones are not hollow the birds bones have holes
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:50.640]  in them in essence this is so genius right and then you look at the bird's wing fold it up and
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:57.280]  you unfold it and you see an anatomical anatomical similarities to our hands and you say there has
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:02.480]  to be a grand design then you study einstein you know the kids in college have the picture with
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:06.720]  the crazier with the tongue out that was an einstein einstein is the man who went to the
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:10.880]  perimeters of the universe and came back and said the more i study the outreaches of the
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:17.120]  universe the more i'm the more i have to the more i understand there has to be a god that's
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:23.120]  what einstein actually said in his later years he wasn't this great atheistic hippie and that's
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:28.080]  the left triumph is they take icons and turn them towards their service let's come back and talk

[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:50.480]  reading the whole thing i will get it read by this weekend because the more i borrow into the
[01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:54.800]  mental illness of the left they're a bunch of people that want to be alphas but they don't
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:59.520]  want the responsibility and they're not real intellectuals they want to savor the intellectuals
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:04.400]  then create an authoritarian system where all thought has to be approved by them that's called
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:12.160]  a cult and they are waging war with any stable civilization because they want to conquer it
[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:18.000]  instead of joining with it it's it's it's it's just a bunch of betas getting together and trying
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:23.440]  to be alphas is my view and michael savage if he just joined us was getting into i like out of the
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:29.280]  brave new world analogy alpha beta gamma delta i think they're more like deltas you look at guys like
[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:34.960]  will flitzer do you actually think he's even a beta these people are fakers there's nothing
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:40.320]  there there's no education there's no knowledge there's no history or you bring others up well
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:43.520]  what have they actually achieved who are they what have they written that anyone will remember
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:48.320]  alex i have to interject right now because i believe my book today this one is my most
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:52.720]  important book i think it's the definitive book i've written that could lead america back to the
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:58.000]  standards we hold in esteem it may sound too megalomaniacal for most people but you know what's
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.160]  so what i've got to say it if i won't who will if i'm not for myself who will be if i'm only for
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:08.320]  myself who but it's no brag just fact if if not for people like you and a few others matt drudge
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:13.520]  donald trump let's say it myself and a few others if we weren't here we would have lost so we have
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:19.440]  to admit we are the resistance our audience is really the key and so it's true we would be totally
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:23.920]  defeated if it wasn't for us and that means our audience let's just we we're not taking credit
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:28.880]  we're saying we've got the munitions that will blow the enemy up we'd be out of we'd be out of
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:34.000]  business alex i want to do something for you in your audience which is this you know there's a lot
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:40.080]  of books there's a lot of hackney writing this is my my magnus opus it's based on my entire life
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:44.880]  quest can i read you a half of a page hey please take over please do the next segment you've got
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:52.720]  the floor go ahead i was at a funeral for a friend a friend's father and um i had told a friend of mine
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:57.280]  who was an american you know a world war two hero who was a bit of a nazi i loved him anyway we're
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:03.840]  friends we argue all the time but we had a mutual respect for each other and we fight argue whatever
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:09.440]  so my friend's father dies henry had survived or switch they cut three of his hands fingers off
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:18.640]  in a saw he was an extremely bitter man so he dies and so i go to the funeral and my friend
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:24.240]  the nazi kind of nazi sympathies was bob so i'm going to read from there it's a half a page so bob
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:29.200]  shut his mouth that night many years ago and as i've said he tends to harbor certain nazi sentiments
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:35.200]  so when i told him about murray's mutilated hand i wasn't surprised at his lack of immediate
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:41.120]  pitting sounds but i like a challenge so i went on murray never cried about his hand i told bob he
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:46.080]  came to america with florence who he met somewhere over there and had a family namely joel he was
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:51.440]  full of life this murray he was a big drinker he loved women he beat his son with a strap but he
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:57.440]  was a big personality bob nodded at that i think the anti-semide in him liked the never cried and
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:03.440]  beat his son parts of murray so i proceeded with my funeral story i had lost touch with my friend
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:07.520]  joel for a few years his wife threw him out for beating her and at least one of their daughters
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:13.600]  and he was in one of his episodic hideings this time from the sheriff's department they were after
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:19.600]  him for his house and all his earnings to give to his greedy wife somehow i heard his father murray
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:24.560]  had cancer and was dying i called his mother and went over a few days later we brought over a bag
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:28.800]  of groceries you know french bread a pound of sliced turkey some wines and vegetables and a quarter
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:33.440]  milk the usual stuff you bring with someone sick poor at housebound florence and joel greeted us at
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:39.280]  the door of their little one bedroom apartment i always liked it there remembering the holidays of
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:44.960]  my own house when i was a boy having been in the antique business like my deceased father benny
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:49.680]  the place was filled with oversized high quality furniture and paintings murray was in a bathroom
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:53.920]  but a gigantic english armchair shrunken but beautiful in a way he pulled me close and said
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:58.960]  michael michael i remember when you took me and and joel to berkeley almost 20 years ago i know
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:04.560]  you almost 20 years that's not a short time he said you took me to a bar on telegraph avenue
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:09.680]  michael those were the good times now are the bad times bob i prodded you hear this i extend one
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:13.840]  good d 20 years ago and this guy remembers it's like one of the best moments of his life there's
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:19.040]  one drink i bought him so he goes fast into the hospital where he insists they let him out
[01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:23.360]  probably to die at home and three or four days later boom it's over like that joel told me
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.800]  he had been sick most of the night vomiting probably those toxic chemicals he forces himself up
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:34.320]  and says joel she's there on your left the angel of death joel gets scared he says pop there's
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:39.600]  nobody here but me and mom murray stares at the big chair across the small room to your right joel
[01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:45.680]  on the couch there there he stands up starts to walk across the room and collapses i can see that
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:52.640]  even the anti-semite bob is tearing up wiping the tears from his face listen you racist bastard i said
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:57.840]  to him looking at that hole in the ground with murray's casket so bare and hearing the rabbi's
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:02.560]  ancient chant and watching the young mexican gravediggers moved by that chant i became reminded
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:07.840]  reminded of my own whole waiting i never knew where i wanted to live i whispered to joel's
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:12.880]  friend from israeli intelligence and i sure don't know where i want to die that we never
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:17.840]  know where we're going to die he reminded me with a 70s rockers cackle and grin
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:26.880]  that's it i write jazz see people think of me in a way that i'm not they make me into what i'm not
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:33.520]  they categorize you they categorize me i'm fundamentally a poet and a writer who's also
[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:39.360]  got some political beliefs i'm not a politician who also writes and they want to challenge me on a
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:42.960]  literary level if they want to challenge me let them write something better than that it's in god
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:48.560]  faith and reason this is not a book of preachy this is a book of stories well exactly in the
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:53.200]  what i get from that is death's the great equalizer and all of our shared humanity and struggles
[01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:59.680]  together unify us if you tell stories about life and death and friends it brings everybody together
[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:03.840]  some you know a holocaust survivor or some guy with nazi sympathies that's why they want to keep us
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:09.200]  divided and dumb the culture down because literature like that that points out real feelings we had
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:15.200]  unifies us in our humanity and our life and our death the division is what we're talking about
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:21.520]  and we have to remember that as the true resistance isn't interesting how smart the devil is they take
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:26.320]  we who are the resistance and make themselves into resistors exactly i see all these dumb idiots
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:30.240]  driving around here in san francisco with the bumper stick is to say resist and you've been
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:34.800]  saying and i've been saying we are the resistance for decades suddenly they're the resistance no
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:39.440]  we haven't taken the country back we're just beginning to to to pull the the other the plus out
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:46.320]  well i understand all of it the hatred for donald trump is not really a hatred for donald trump
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:52.640]  it's a hatred for white heterosexual christian males we know that everyone knows that it's
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:58.320]  because he's a white heterosexual christian male it's not because he is a left winger or a right
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:04.000]  winger they just wanted somebody other than a white heterosexual christian male in the white
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.960]  house period and the story i was gonna ask you that we do one more little segment of the break
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:13.520]  now suddenly it's a coming out not mainly by minorities mainly white people and others saying
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:18.880]  whites are evil get rid of them if you have a white baby abort it major feminist magazines
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:25.120]  this isn't just a few people the left is really showing us that they're anti christian anti white
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:29.120]  to a larian level but reversed but hitler wasn't a christian he was anti christian
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:35.360]  this is how it started this is what they do they demonize us first then they march us into the
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:40.000]  camps and then they kill us i'm warning people out there it's much worse than they think it starts
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:45.680]  with an idea the holocaust started with an idea written by a french anti-semite a long time before
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:52.400]  the ovens were actually built a long time before the zyklon b was actually manufactured i'm warning
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:58.960]  everybody listening to me these professors are the true evil nazis of our time these must be
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:05.600]  weeded out like the poison that they are and the universities that harbor these evil failed
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:11.280]  intellects must be called on the carpet as well i blame the universities i don't blame these marginal
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:18.240]  psychotics pol pot how did pol pot start a little tiny guy in cambodia he went to paris to study
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:23.920]  marxism he became enthralled with marxism he came back and introduced marxism in cambodia
[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:28.720]  he put together the 13 year olds the 14 year olds he gave them the red uh bandanas he called them the
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:34.640]  red brigades what did the red brigades do the camea rouge they went and they started by humiliating
[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:41.920]  the middle class their own race now doctors lawyers engineers architects hold on do one more segment
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:47.920]  explain the process of how they get a group ready to be exterminated and you see it again
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:51.840]  exactly being followed formulaically and then you hear the weatherman and others saying we're

[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:16.960]  getting into the left their authoritarianism and all over the news hashtag hunt republicans and
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:22.080]  rand paul being tackled and attacked and uh republican members of city councils being shot
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:26.080]  in the face by their neighbors and congressman's police and on and on they're getting violent
[01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:31.520]  they want violence uh they're they're pushing it and you were getting historically with the cameroog
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:36.240]  cambodia and the pull pot the killing fields as an example but it always basically follows
[01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:41.760]  the same formula please continue with that historic warning dr sabbage i will but i want
[01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:46.720]  to say something the book god faith and reason it's a very benign looking book isn't it michael
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:51.920]  let's say you don't know me you see this in the bookstore nice old guy god faith and reason
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:59.120]  and if people took this to work and put it on their desks let's see how tolerant the left is
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:04.800]  from a benign book such as this which is almost apolitical okay let's just see it as a little
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:12.400]  billboard on a desk at work pull pot cambodia nice professor goes to paris studies marxism
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:17.360]  comes back and says i'm gonna introduce that economic system so he introduces it then he
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:23.760]  hires 12 13 14 year old boys and girls gives them the cameroos the red scarf he tells them go out
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:28.640]  and humiliate the teachers anyone who could read or write anyone it was literate in cambodia
[01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:35.600]  was targeted by the marxists didn't man well one race remember that teachers doctors lawyers
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:42.080]  engineers counts didn't matter any literate person was first humiliated personally humiliated in the
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:49.200]  street like you're being yelled at that's how it starts and the thugs the cameroos then worked
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:54.240]  them in the fields and killed them now we had the mountain of skulls that's what communism brings
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:50:01.200]  that's what rachel madcow wolf blitzer and company will bring to this country unless they are taught
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:05.840]  who they are and what they're doing to this nation they may not actually think they want that to
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:10.880]  happen but they will lead to a mountainous skulls unless they are rained in somebody has to explain
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:16.400]  to these sub morons these subintellectuals these pseudo-intellectuals these uneducated
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:23.760]  adults that things start with an idea okay now you see in this country who's the cameroos do we
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:29.600]  have it well of course we have it the anti-father democratic party how about fergus in missouri
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:34.560]  how about baltimore maryland what was that there was a reason for ferguson burning a city down
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:39.600]  attacking police the killing of police the war against police this is all part of the same
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:46.080]  cameroos effect in the united states of america they couch it under the guise of only certain
[01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:54.080]  lives matter they use race as a shield and a spear to silence those of us who see who they are
[01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:59.760]  but never forget their end they have said point blank what they want to do they want to kill 30
[01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:05.680]  million americans i read this in the 60s alex this is nothing new i forget the name of the group
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:09.920]  he's still alive he's obama's good friend there in chicago that's the weatherman that's uh bill
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:14.880]  airs said thank you bill airs was a member of a group that said if we kill 30 million americans
[01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:19.840]  we'll we'll be able to save america don't think that they still don't want to do it our population
[01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:24.400]  has doubled since then so it's it'd be 60 million well about the number that was killed in other
[01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:29.920]  countries under that kind of psychosis so if it's killer be killed people better take the proper
[01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:35.200]  steps to protect themselves last february i was attacked outside a restaurant remember that story
[01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:40.880]  yes okay i mean i'm an older guy i didn't pick a fight i was sitting there with my dog having
[01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:45.360]  two drinks people came like me we talked and some guy was on the end of a bar older guy
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:49.440]  i didn't say one word to him i didn't even look at him but it was i walked out of the restaurant
[01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:55.040]  i turned around the area is looming over me 20 years younger a foot tall one thing led to another
[01:51:55.040 --> 01:52:01.200]  i wound up on my ass luckily i didn't die didn't break my skull the dog got scared to death the
[01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:06.080]  poor little teddy was shaking like a leaf rand paul had six broken ribs in a punctured lung
[01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:09.920]  and then now he's come out said no the neighbor hates me he's a leftist and the media is making
[01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:15.440]  excuses for it he tackled him and then started stomping him in his yard unbelievable this guy
[01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:18.800]  should be charged with murder first was a u.s senator how come he had no secret service
[01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:23.360]  diane feinstein has secret service wait a minute why doesn't he have any secret
[01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:28.320]  service it only applies to the leftists let's put that aside we're all i don't think conservatives
[01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:33.840]  and people are just too regular he was mowing his own yard well that's a terrible story he
[01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:38.800]  could have been killed but the point of my being knocked to the ground was who protected me at that
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:42.880]  time from getting killed hurt banging my head breaking my ribs i'm an older guy how come i
[01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:48.000]  didn't break anything alex i'm gonna tell the story on the air today several times in my life
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:55.440]  and i'm not tempting fate god knows i'm not tempting fate i've seen a hand come down a hand
[01:52:55.440 --> 01:53:01.520]  came down cushion the blow it could be the push ups i do at night it could be a lifetime of very
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:11.360]  clean living uh that's a joke but nothing nothing broke i was in fiji 30 40 years ago and i was a
[01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:16.000]  plant collector looking for medicinal plants way ahead of all of the you know all of the people
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:20.960]  who know that think they know this field right now plant collector one night we're drinking
[01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:25.600]  kava kava all night i wanted to leave the village all of my melanesian friends they're black people
[01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:30.560]  in the islands they used to look at me when we drank a lot of kava and they'd say to me in fiji
[01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:36.160]  and i think he's fiji and they look at my eyes i guess that was a transracial thing uh they love
[01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:41.360]  me i love them all of a sudden the middle of this kava drinking i had an instinct i wanted to leave
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:46.480]  that village i said so my friend domino said don't go don't go don't go i said i have to go he's i
[01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:51.040]  can't go right now man we've been drinking this all night i said i got to get out of here so i go i walk
[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:56.240]  in the dark along an edge i go back to my other village the next morning he comes to me he was
[01:53:56.240 --> 01:54:01.600]  like shaken he said come back with me i want you to see what you walked on he said you were walking
[01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:08.320]  on a on a path that fell about 500 feet to the sea it was six inches wide this little path that you
[01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:14.160]  were on and you didn't fall i look back on that moment and i have to say to you i think that
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:19.920]  god put me here for a reason and i think the reason is the sin qua non of god faith and reason
[01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:23.520]  i believe this book could be the one that reaches to those who have left god
[01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:28.640]  and again it's not a book to bring you to a church or a synagogue or a temple it's a book
[01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:33.120]  to bring you to yourself because in looking for god you'll find yourself people don't know who
[01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:37.840]  they are today you'll throw away the drugs you'll throw away all the crutches you'll throw away
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:43.200]  the beads you'll throw away the dream catchers you'll throw away your evil leftism and you just
[01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:50.080]  might find that god might be your salvation because believe me as i sit here there's a reason
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:56.000]  for everything and god is above all of us as rocky graziano the great middleweight fighter said
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:59.600]  somebody up there likes me and i hope that somebody up there likes you alec and i hope
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:04.400]  somebody up there likes me and i hope somebody up there really still likes america despite what we
[01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:10.800]  have done to ourselves by permitting this virus of left-wing fascism to take over the country
[01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:14.240]  well i think you've hit the hard here it's not just that liberalism is a mental illness
[01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:20.720]  liberals hate god and they hate existing success and they don't want to join with it
[01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:24.480]  even though we're not trying to make them we have free will they don't like that we made some of the
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:30.160]  better free will discussions and some of the better free will choices in our life and they
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:35.520]  don't like free will and want to force us into their authoritarianism and then they believe
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:40.320]  they're in power by bullying us intellectually and spiritually as they see us rebelling they're
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:45.600]  having an existential crisis because they feel like they're dying as their control over us
[01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:49.520]  is dissipated they're they're they're going through a true breakdown
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:58.240]  look at all the major inventions of the world trains cars planes telegraph computers medical

[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:29.680]  in china came to an end when the mandarins took over who were the mandarins at that time
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:34.640]  the mandarins were the central government types the long fingernails they sat up there in the

[01:59:50.800 --> 02:00:00.400]  jones show i'm sorry to have to report to you that anti-white racism in america is on the rise
[02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:05.760]  and of course it's liberals who are behind it so let's take a look at just a small sample of some
[02:00:05.760 --> 02:00:11.520]  of the most recent incidents like this brand new report in the new york times written by a black
[02:00:11.520 --> 02:00:17.760]  man who asks can my children be friends with white people who goes on to blame president trump for
[02:00:17.760 --> 02:00:22.720]  having to teach his kids that they might not be able to play with white boys and girls because
[02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:28.480]  they might be racist quote donald trump's election has made it clear that i will teach my boys the
[02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:35.280]  lesson generations old one that i for the most part nearly escaped i will teach them to be cautious
[02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:41.520]  i will teach them suspicion and i will teach them distrust much sooner than i thought i would i will

[02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:15.440]  her because she's not a social justice warrior or at least not social justice warrior enough
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:22.080]  in 2017 swift is still absenting herself from the cultural conversation taylor swiss reputations
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:28.960]  a complicated mess they say love her or hate her she knows this and we know this it's what her

[02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:18.000]  dear white women interracial relationships and biracial children do not absolve you of racism
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:22.000]  i'm sorry white people were damned if we do damned if we don't remember the stories from
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:25.760]  halloween this year where the liberal media was telling parents that they had white children
[02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:30.160]  that they couldn't allow them to dress up as the disney character from one of their recent films
[02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:34.800]  mona or moana how the hell you say it that's called till appropriation well there was something
[02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:38.960]  equally insane that i forgot to mention those same lunatics were trying to shame parents
[02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:44.160]  and stop them from allowing their daughters to dress up as elsa if they were white because it
[02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:50.080]  promoted this notion that white beauty is supreme and this is why butch people on forechan came up
[02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:55.520]  with this idea to troll liberals in real life on high school and college campuses by encouraging
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:03:01.760]  people to print up flyers that simply say it's okay to be white and to post them around the schools
[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:07.280]  not only did a lot of people do this but multiple schools started publicly denouncing the flyers
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:12.800]  and it started making headlines across the country the news at 11 continues with a disturbing
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:16.960]  story out of montgomery county students found flyers take them at high school that say it's
[02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:23.360]  okay to be white oh no call the fbi this is a disturbing story they said it's disturbing all
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:27.840]  right it's disturbing that you think there's a problem with these flyers this is a report from
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:34.160]  an abc affiliate in washington dc it's okay to be white sign found on doors at montgomery
[02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:40.080]  Blair high school in maryland school says flyers were removed and says they're investigating
[02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:45.280]  what the hell is there to investigate meanwhile another massive hate crime hoax has been exposed
[02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:50.880]  which is why there's an entire chapter in my new book the true story of fake news on fake hate crimes
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:55.680]  i hope you check it out in paperback on amazon.com or download it on your tablet or your e-reading

[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:13.120]  of five black cadet candidates at the air force academy preparatory school earlier this week one
[02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:18.480]  cadet candidates mother posted a photo on her facebook page that shows the words go home and
[02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:24.880]  word written on the whiteboard outside her son's room oh wait what's this a black student wrote
[02:04:24.880 --> 02:04:31.120]  those racist messages that shook the air force academy school says the racist messages roiled the
[02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:35.920]  academy in colorado springs and prompted the school to launch an investigation they led its
[02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:41.360]  superintendent to deliver a stern speech that decried the horrible language and drew national
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:47.040]  attention for its eloquence but on tuesday the school made a jolting announcement the person
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:52.320]  responsible for the racist messages the academy said was in fact one of the all right that's
[02:04:52.320 --> 02:05:00.880]  smart guys i'm alex jones stay with us we're running the biggest specials we've run in like six

[02:05:47.440 --> 02:05:55.840]  worldwide broadcast america rebirth and renaissance was so much coming up today
[02:06:03.520 --> 02:06:13.680]  waging war on corruption it's alex joe zero coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:21.200]  zero hour is here turn the greatest political and financial upheaval in modern history your
[02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:27.600]  advantage harry s dent jr is joining us in just one moment but first take a look at this
[02:06:32.080 --> 02:06:36.800]  we don't know what we're doing we have leaders that are grossly incompetent they said it could
[02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:44.800]  never happen again american revolution the u.s civil war world war one the 1929 crash the rise of
[02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:51.440]  hitler world war two the atomic bomb the arab oil crisis and the global financial crisis of
[02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:57.680]  winston church all once said the farther back you look the farther forward you're likely to see
[02:06:58.320 --> 02:07:04.320]  those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it what if all these events happen
[02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:10.880]  simultaneously imagine the unimaginable the cycle of history suggests that we are on the brink of
[02:07:10.880 --> 02:07:17.920]  something this big something of a magnitude never seen before where mankind faces challenges
[02:07:17.920 --> 02:07:23.760]  endures the healing and rises up again in the prosperity strengthened wealth this is about
[02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:30.240]  the destruction of the old ways top-down management establishment politics social engineering
[02:07:30.240 --> 02:07:36.640]  financial and monetary manipulation wealthy elitism and the rising up of a new world history
[02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:45.440]  tells the future are you ready for zero hour the greatest political and economic revolution
[02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:56.960]  since the advent of democracy itself history tells the future beautiful way to say that
[02:07:56.960 --> 02:08:03.760]  that i'm actually just so i get it out there working on a book that has that basic title and
[02:08:03.760 --> 02:08:07.040]  i haven't read zero hour it just came in a few days ago again just like michael savages book
[02:08:07.040 --> 02:08:10.400]  i can't wait to read it by the way i don't get paid to promote these books and i don't just
[02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:15.760]  have people on uh because you know they're they're they're paying me to have money's not paying me
[02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:19.280]  to have money i had michael savages he's a great guest and i love reading his books the same thing
[02:08:19.280 --> 02:08:25.040]  with uh mr dent but if you see a confluence or coming together or the basic terms we're using
[02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:28.960]  it's not because we're plagiarizing each other it's because if you study history you know the
[02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:35.360]  future if you know history you know the future uh history rhymes as mr dent uh has uh you
[02:08:36.080 --> 02:08:42.480]  quote another famous historian and again we have these corrupt elites we have the centralization
[02:08:42.480 --> 02:08:47.040]  we have the crony capitalism i want to see it come down but then i see trump come in and it puff
[02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:52.000]  back up even though it's a fraud he's trying to do it for the general public and it's now been
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:09:00.240]  tied to his success on the success of americana and free market and so it makes me not want it to fail
[02:09:00.240 --> 02:09:04.960]  but i do realize it's still built even though he's cutting regulations and doing some good things
[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:10.960]  it's built within a system designed to implode so when do we run into that brick wall and what
[02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:16.560]  do we do once we hit it harry s dent thanks for joining us zero hour is the new book harry dent
[02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:22.000]  dot com thanks for coming on with us yeah alex i mean this really i've been talking about this for
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:28.400]  many years obviously we have a debt bubble a financial asset bubble and stocks and real estate
[02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:32.640]  and everything and those things always burst and that was my last book the sale of a lifetime
[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:39.360]  but this book is about something i've been talking about for many years a bigger revolution like
[02:09:39.360 --> 02:09:45.760]  democracy and free market capitalism that in their pure forms came together in the late 1700s
[02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:51.200]  and you know what now uh central banks have taken over free markets and special interests have taken
[02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:57.520]  over democracy we don't have those two factors anymore in this revolution with the internet
[02:09:57.520 --> 02:10:04.240]  and better communication and even like cryptocurrencies and new things coming out is going to change
[02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:12.000]  this political in our business organizations everything else and create an even greater
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:17.920]  bottoms up economy around those principles sure so you're saying zero hour haven't ready yet is
[02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:23.840]  about what happens after the next crash yes well and it's also about what you do coming into it
[02:10:23.840 --> 02:10:29.680]  you have to protect your assets the u.s dollar did the best in the last crash and will again
[02:10:30.480 --> 02:10:35.920]  high quality bonds do well that's what does well in a deflationary crash when bubbles burst
[02:10:35.920 --> 02:10:39.920]  everything else gets killed so you have to protect your wealth now you have to consider
[02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:46.400]  where do i live how do i protect myself from some level of chaos in society because this is not going
[02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:52.160]  to be easy what we're going to go through we we got to we got to get rid of a a bubble we've
[02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:58.160]  got to change our political system we've got a real line around cultures that are more compatible
[02:10:58.160 --> 02:11:02.720]  like the red and blue cultures in the u.s and the suni and the shia in the middle east and all
[02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:09.040]  this stuff there's a lot to do here so you really need to be settled down and and get safe first
[02:11:09.040 --> 02:11:13.280]  and then you know we can tell you how to take advantage of these changes there's going to be
[02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:20.640]  huge opportunities to come out of it how long on the short term versus the long term in the bubble
[02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:26.880]  stayed inflated well you know for economically the worst we have four indicators pointing down
[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:35.120]  into early 2020 and then a few more pointing down into 2022-23 so i'd say the next three to five years
[02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:41.600]  is going to be the worst economically and for things like the stock market but this uh political
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:46.480]  revolution we're talking about is going to take a couple decades to really set in and and we're
[02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:52.000]  talking about i you know i've got a chart here as well we got three cycles pointing to a major
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:59.760]  revolution like the late 1700 a 250 year deep political revolution an 84 year popular cycle
[02:11:59.760 --> 02:12:06.480]  which started in the early 30s and again here with trump and brexit and then a 28 year and an 80 year
[02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:13.440]  economic cycle so this is going to only take four five six years to play out but the bigger
[02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:18.960]  political revolution and then in the next chart we have globalization there's a backlash against
[02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:24.400]  globalization which trump is is leading more than and that was my next question the EU says oh try to
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:29.680]  leave us we built a secret army just like germany did in the 30s we're going to invade you already
[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:35.920]  five countries day one say we're ready to fight you i mean the EU once you have to start talking
[02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:42.320]  about fighting members that never voted to enter you're in and you're you're done and spain's having
[02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:48.160]  to fight catalan and on and on and on we're so we show in this book around the world we have
[02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:54.240]  countries in europe united states even china india everywhere you look where there are huge
[02:12:54.240 --> 02:13:00.640]  disparities in incomes and cultures and religions between different parts of countries and you know
[02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:07.440]  what you can't bring those together our political polarization is the most extreme much more than
[02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:12.400]  the great depression in the roaring 20s more like the civil war so so like we said in this little
[02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:18.400]  short video what if we have kind of like a civil war a great depression and a revolution in politics
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:22.080]  and business at the same time and that's what the history we're looking at and that's what you
[02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:26.240]  said we're looking at that's what the historic patterns and this contemporary information
[02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:31.360]  all points towards kind of a super storm yes and i get i've been saying this for a long time but i've
[02:13:31.360 --> 02:13:37.200]  been concentrating before on on the bubble in in debt and in financial assets because that's the
[02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:42.800]  first thing to go but i've always been saying we i've been saying for 20 years since my first book
[02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:48.160]  we're going to have the biggest revolution since democracy and free market and it's happening stay

[02:19:59.360 --> 02:20:19.120]  mr. harry dent formerly uh with vane cap alone big groups has a great history as a researcher
[02:20:19.120 --> 02:20:25.520]  and economist and author is joining us right now in the last segment today i haven't gotten all
[02:20:25.520 --> 02:20:30.880]  these videos of oh the little vacuum cleaner robot in your house hacked by hackers watching you in
[02:20:30.880 --> 02:20:35.680]  your house or hackers getting into your thermostat because i covered it 20 years ago you get
[02:20:38.240 --> 02:20:44.160]  you get today's news 20 years early is basically what's really happening here so that's all going
[02:20:44.160 --> 02:20:49.040]  to be coming up but you were getting into revolutions i understand you're more of a
[02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:53.760]  political atheist or a free market guy and i i don't like some of the stuff republicans have
[02:20:53.760 --> 02:20:59.280]  done or democrats have done but there's a derangement in the left where just because i supported
[02:20:59.280 --> 02:21:04.720]  trump over hillary they throw coffee on you they physically attack you they're calling for death
[02:21:04.720 --> 02:21:09.840]  of you know members of congress they want trump dead mainstream media promotes it i mean these
[02:21:09.840 --> 02:21:14.400]  people have gotten nothing from the system all they see is an old system being propped up right
[02:21:14.400 --> 02:21:19.360]  now by trump and i don't want the revolution to happen if it totally collapses they want clowered
[02:21:19.360 --> 02:21:24.240]  and piven they think if stuff collapses there'll be a socialist reorganization and they're gonna get
[02:21:24.240 --> 02:21:31.680]  some chicken in every pot uh scenario uh they don't get that f dr was propping up a capitalist
[02:21:31.680 --> 02:21:36.080]  system using socialism i guess is an emergency you can argue whether it was good or not but
[02:21:37.200 --> 02:21:43.680]  you talk about political upheaval the backlash against people waking up to centralization
[02:21:43.680 --> 02:21:50.000]  seems like piranhas on pcp how does that feed into this political superstorm you're talking about
[02:21:50.960 --> 02:21:56.160]  okay i i get number one central banks have taken over the free market capitalist system
[02:21:56.160 --> 02:22:00.400]  they're setting the economy to grow at three percent which they can achieve through their best
[02:22:00.400 --> 02:22:05.520]  efforts of all the stimulation world with two percent inflation this is not how the economy
[02:22:05.520 --> 02:22:11.680]  works it it's a balance of opposites you have booms and bust inflation deflation the economy
[02:22:11.680 --> 02:22:16.800]  knows how to heal itself just like the human body and doctors usually spend most of their time
[02:22:16.800 --> 02:22:21.200]  preventing the human body from healing itself because they want to prevent the common cold like
[02:22:21.200 --> 02:22:26.960]  economists want to prevent recession so the system does have to fail alex and i hate to say it
[02:22:26.960 --> 02:22:32.720]  because everybody thinks well central banks have created another decent economy now no i get it but
[02:22:32.720 --> 02:22:39.760]  the left wants it to fail the left wants it to fail and never come back no well yeah no i wanted
[02:22:39.760 --> 02:22:44.960]  to fail so it can come back no i totally agree but i'm saying they see free market as competition to
[02:22:44.960 --> 02:22:52.640]  their socialist utopia how do we deal with that well again i mean republicans want to cut taxes
[02:22:52.640 --> 02:22:57.440]  right at the wrong time when corporate profits are higher than ever unemployment is lowest ever
[02:22:57.440 --> 02:23:03.200]  workforce growth is not growing we don't need more investment we have low capacity utilization
[02:23:03.200 --> 02:23:08.880]  republicans want to stimulate through tax cuts the democrats want to have social engineering
[02:23:08.880 --> 02:23:15.600]  which is also already failed the whole thing has to fail and then people have to realize oh we can't
[02:23:15.600 --> 02:23:20.240]  look to central banks you know we can't look to special interests they're never going to give us
[02:23:20.240 --> 02:23:27.040]  the right research to change our economy and then you get a revolution and the people start to win
[02:23:27.040 --> 02:23:34.880]  it's unfortunate but the old system does have to fail to some significant degree to build the new
[02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:39.520]  out of the ashes but i i just know this from studying history i wish it weren't the case but
[02:23:39.520 --> 02:23:43.680]  that's no i know you're right i mean look at the plague it's prevented this from failing with all
[02:23:43.680 --> 02:23:48.960]  this quantitative easing and free money they've not let the system fail and let's look at let's
[02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:53.040]  look at the black plague in the 1600s i mean i know you've written about that scenario explain
[02:23:53.040 --> 02:24:01.760]  that to people why why did that cause the renaissance well it did you know it when things fail people
[02:24:01.760 --> 02:24:07.920]  have to get real i always told people look every day people i'm talking every day people become heroes
[02:24:07.920 --> 02:24:13.600]  when there's a crisis 9 11 or the barn's burning and people don't think oh am i gonna die they run
[02:24:13.600 --> 02:24:19.200]  in they save the horse they save the dog they save the baby the people this is what happens people
[02:24:19.200 --> 02:24:24.880]  get real we are living in la la land on both sides the republicans think if you just keep cutting
[02:24:24.880 --> 02:24:30.240]  taxes the economy is going to grow no not when you've over expanded the liberals think oh if we just
[02:24:30.240 --> 02:24:35.520]  keep giving more welfare and spending printing more money oh we can keep going no these things
[02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:41.840]  kill the free market capitalist system they kill and special interests kill democracy these things
[02:24:41.840 --> 02:24:47.200]  have to fail so that we don't trust them anymore and we don't look to somebody to come in and give
[02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:53.440]  us a free lunch everything sure let's historically it's been a free lunch free lunch solution our
[02:24:53.440 --> 02:24:57.360]  audience understands that we're just trying to debate when is the big crash coming or how long
[02:24:57.360 --> 02:25:01.920]  could we prop it up while we get ourselves in position and then we worry about the globalist
[02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:05.520]  coming in and trying to use it to take full authoritarian control which they say they've
[02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:11.200]  done and in which they've done other countries so we know what's coming there's a lot of problems
[02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:14.720]  a lot of sharks are going to take advantage of this not in free market ways the way you're talking
[02:25:14.720 --> 02:25:19.920]  about to protect yourself but in very predatory ways how does the revolution thing from your
[02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:25.680]  historical perspective play into this well i mean again first of all i mean that's why i wrote this
[02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:34.080]  book um because the signs in late 2016 brexit and then trump getting elected against the odds and in
[02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:39.200]  the day trump got elected we said oh my god even though we were cautious about the market back
[02:25:39.200 --> 02:25:44.800]  there we're not no the markets are gonna love this we're gonna see a 20 25 run now we've seen
[02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:50.880]  that so that makes me think this is like the final blow off rally in the bubble and the other thing
[02:25:50.880 --> 02:25:56.320]  i'm looking for alex and it's very simple and it's starting to happen i'm looking for a divergence
[02:25:56.320 --> 02:26:02.480]  between the main indexes like the nasdaq and the dow and the s&p and the small caps the russell
[02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:09.280]  2000 and the dow transport when those indexes start to fail before the big ones it's a sign
[02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:13.680]  that the bubble's getting ready to birth and that is starting to happen i need a little more
[02:26:13.680 --> 02:26:18.080]  confirmation next month too but i think we're in a topping process and this chart is perfect
[02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:23.600]  that we've had four bubbles in this bubble boom and i was calling our our long-term research
[02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:31.120]  we have four seasons in our economy spring boom inflationary recession like the 70s a fall bubble
[02:26:31.120 --> 02:26:37.360]  boom and then a depression or a winter season this is the fourth and largest bubble and people
[02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:41.920]  keep going on cnbc and all these financial new states say oh this isn't a bubble because all
[02:26:41.920 --> 02:26:46.960]  these reasons this is a bubble it's the biggest bubble in all history china is even bigger than
[02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:52.800]  ours this bubble looks ready to blow i would guess it's topping between october and january
[02:26:52.800 --> 02:26:59.200]  and between 2018 19 and 20 when our indicators are the most negative is when we're going to see this
[02:26:59.200 --> 02:27:04.160]  worst of this financial downturn but again what i'm saying in this book the political
[02:27:04.720 --> 02:27:11.040]  and the social repercussions this blue red split in this whole you know how do we reorganize our
[02:27:11.040 --> 02:27:16.320]  world around more compatible cultures that's going to take many many years and this backlash
[02:27:16.320 --> 02:27:22.000]  against globalization which again was a good trend for a long time but it went too far globalization
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:27.440]  it just brought us into each other's throats and everybody hates each other rich versus poor black
[02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:35.200]  versus white suny versus shia red versus blue um baby boomers versus millennials millennials feel
[02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:41.760]  totally threatened by the baby booms a massive debt and entitlement and and they are so so we
[02:27:41.760 --> 02:27:46.880]  have to sort all this out it's going to be messy which is why you need to preserve your wealth get
[02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:52.720]  in safe investments be in a safe place and be healthy that's what you need to get through this
[02:27:52.720 --> 02:27:58.880]  and if you do the world's going to be your oyster well i'm not disagreeing with you that we're sitting
[02:27:58.880 --> 02:28:03.360]  on top of giant bubble that's just a fact i'm concerned there are people that actually want to
[02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:08.560]  bring the bubble down and have trump's recovery fail just so they can blame him that's not even
[02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:14.800]  looking at you know he's just trying to put off something that was already there and you know
[02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:18.720]  you've been saying the bubble was going to bust for the last few years i'm not saying you're wrong
[02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:23.280]  i'm just saying i you who knows now there were so many artificial things suppressing the economy
[02:28:23.280 --> 02:28:28.880]  before like regulations and the coal being turned off that you add all those other stimulus in
[02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:35.840]  who knows but i agree it's a damn if you do damn if you don't because it props it up everything's
[02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:40.320]  okay for a while but the one implodes it's even bigger we'll talk about how you would protect
[02:28:40.320 --> 02:28:44.800]  yourself straight ahead and then we've got a bunch of technology news in the final segment before

[02:32:05.360 --> 02:32:11.040]  that i don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system but right now we're dealing
[02:32:11.040 --> 02:32:17.520]  with massive parasites which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism
[02:32:17.520 --> 02:32:23.120]  right now with all the refugees uh spreading disease around we have biological warfare going
[02:32:23.120 --> 02:32:26.720]  on everywhere these are all parasites tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many
[02:32:26.720 --> 02:32:32.000]  things that are in it you have the neem in there you have the organic clove bud the organic wormwood
[02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:36.640]  i recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year all right well i'm glad we've got some
[02:32:36.640 --> 02:32:40.240]  back in because i'm going back on it today it just came back in yesterday living defense
[02:32:40.240 --> 02:32:44.080]  info wars life dot com and folks you can't lose it's full of stuff that's great for your body
[02:32:44.080 --> 02:32:49.440]  period and you support the broadcast info wars lives dot com thank you doctor group from the
[02:32:49.440 --> 02:32:52.640]  global healing center thank you so much for all your work sir on this great product
[02:32:52.640 --> 02:33:10.320]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:33:10.320 --> 02:33:15.280]  the alex jones show because there is a war on or your mind
[02:33:16.880 --> 02:33:20.880]  i remember when i remember i remember when i lost my mind
[02:33:20.880 --> 02:33:32.080]  here's what i know people are vulcanizing the parasitic left has always used government funding
[02:33:32.800 --> 02:33:38.880]  to fund their own projects their own art operations you name it the left also usually are managers over
[02:33:38.880 --> 02:33:43.920]  disenfranchised groups of people that live in government housing or kind of warehousing foster
[02:33:43.920 --> 02:33:49.840]  children things like that it's what they do it's their business and they don't know any better
[02:33:49.840 --> 02:33:57.440]  so they see society collapsing they see that as more for them to feed on so the big problem with
[02:33:57.440 --> 02:34:03.840]  the reality equation that mr dens talking about is we're talking about how to make things better
[02:34:03.840 --> 02:34:08.080]  once the correction comes we're talking about ways to protect ourselves but also stabilize the
[02:34:08.080 --> 02:34:14.320]  government they're looking at ways to overthrow everything and that's why i'm saying it's more
[02:34:14.320 --> 02:34:19.840]  critical than ever to financially support shows like info wars why it's more important than ever
[02:34:19.840 --> 02:34:26.000]  to exercise your free speech and wear the new won't tread on me incredible uh gads and flag
[02:34:27.040 --> 02:34:31.920]  cold pepper men and men shirt that we have an info war store.com because in the future more than
[02:34:31.920 --> 02:34:38.560]  anything it's going to be financially supporting organizations and groups and people that are
[02:34:38.560 --> 02:34:43.040]  fighting for your basic worldview and your way of life this is something conservatives never really
[02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:47.520]  do or libertarians never do we kind of just live our own lives and run our own lives and
[02:34:48.160 --> 02:34:51.840]  we don't want to run other people's lives well if you don't want somebody running your life
[02:34:51.840 --> 02:34:55.600]  you're going to have to get politically involved you have to get financially involved
[02:34:55.600 --> 02:34:59.520]  and and and not to educate yourself with books like zero hour that again i'm going to be reading
[02:34:59.520 --> 02:35:06.800]  this weekend uh by harry s dent but the book that sabbage wrote or the information we cover
[02:35:07.520 --> 02:35:11.440]  briefly i want to play this clip as he mentioned worldwide revolutions the country's working with
[02:35:11.440 --> 02:35:16.640]  countries is a great idea it opens up markets more products more innovation more ideas anybody in
[02:35:16.640 --> 02:35:21.120]  any business will tell you more people more business more connections more more ideas
[02:35:22.320 --> 02:35:27.680]  it's the opposite of stagnation but you try to bring in and repopulate europe with third world
[02:35:27.680 --> 02:35:32.240]  muslim populations uh and then the the left's there to get them all in welfare that's a disaster
[02:35:32.880 --> 02:35:39.280]  you want to put an e u army out to take over countries because they want to pull out well
[02:35:39.280 --> 02:35:43.120]  that's the fastest way to make them pull out even quicker and you can say well spain will keep
[02:35:43.120 --> 02:35:48.640]  catalan in for a while longer doesn't matter once the people know they're captured it's like some
[02:35:48.640 --> 02:35:52.960]  guy that's chaining his wife up when he goes to work she's going to get loose someday you're
[02:35:52.960 --> 02:35:57.280]  going to go to jail or she's not she's going to be long gone and we've we've reached that point
[02:35:57.280 --> 02:36:02.400]  where the left is trying who doesn't even the left just people that feel like they're the left
[02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:06.560]  are there to dominate folks it's not working anymore so i want to ask mr dent historically
[02:36:06.560 --> 02:36:11.840]  looking at the charts how this revolution fleshes out how it can look but he's predicted it i've
[02:36:11.840 --> 02:36:15.680]  predicted it ron paul's predicted it so many others are predicted that the cia people we've
[02:36:15.680 --> 02:36:20.240]  had on like steve pacinic and predicted it 10 years ago that the e would fail and things would
[02:36:20.240 --> 02:36:26.720]  break up it's here what does that mean as the central controllers push authoritarianism here
[02:36:26.720 --> 02:36:32.000]  is a clip of nigel farage the fastest growing movement not just in the uk the gavis brings it
[02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:39.200]  it but also in europe pointing out what's really going on here it is mr farage two and a half minutes
[02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:43.600]  thank you as mr muskevich he said at the start of this the leak of all these papers and lists
[02:36:43.600 --> 02:36:48.880]  of people with offshore holdings has come about because of the society of investigative journalists
[02:36:48.880 --> 02:36:53.600]  for what's not been said this morning i think is relevant is that the funding of these investigations
[02:36:53.600 --> 02:36:59.840]  came from one george sorris now i say this at a time i'm going to come back to say what
[02:36:59.840 --> 02:37:07.040]  and it may have some personal interest for you as well i say this at a time when the use of money
[02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:12.160]  and the influence it may have had on the brexit result or the trump election has reached a level
[02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:18.880]  of virtual hysteria just last week the electoral commission in the uk launched an investigation
[02:37:18.880 --> 02:37:26.160]  to find out whether the leave campaign took offshore money or russian money this came about
[02:37:26.160 --> 02:37:31.200]  as a result of questions asked in the house of commons by one ben bradshaw somebody linked
[02:37:31.200 --> 02:37:37.120]  to an organization called open society i just wonder when we're talking about offshore money
[02:37:37.120 --> 02:37:41.520]  when we're talking about political subversion when we're talking about collusion i wonder whether
[02:37:41.520 --> 02:37:49.680]  we're looking in the wrong place and i say that because george sorris recently gave open society
[02:37:49.680 --> 02:37:54.880]  his organization which of course campaigns for free movement of peoples and supports
[02:37:54.880 --> 02:38:01.440]  supranational structures like the european union he recently gave it 18 billion dollars
[02:38:02.400 --> 02:38:09.520]  and his influence here and in brussels is truly extraordinary open society boasts that they had
[02:38:09.520 --> 02:38:18.000]  42 meetings last year with the european commission they've even published a book of reliable friends
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:25.360]  in the european parliament and there are 226 names on that list including yours sir i thought i
[02:38:25.360 --> 02:38:31.840]  thought you'd find this interesting we even had last week mr vahovstat lobbying on behalf of mr
[02:38:31.840 --> 02:38:37.200]  sorris at the conference of presidents in a battle that is going on with victor allban the prime
[02:38:37.200 --> 02:38:43.600]  minister of hungary if we're going to have a debate and we're going to talk about full political
[02:38:43.600 --> 02:38:50.720]  and financial transparency well let's do it so i should be writing today to all 226 of you asking
[02:38:50.720 --> 02:38:57.200]  some pretty fair questions have you ever received funds directly or indirectly from open society
[02:38:57.760 --> 02:39:03.920]  how many of their events have you attended could you please give us a list of the meetings of all
[02:39:03.920 --> 02:39:09.840]  the representatives including george sorris yourself and i think this parliament should
[02:39:09.840 --> 02:39:16.240]  now set up a special committee to look into all of this and i say that because i fear we could be
[02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:22.480]  looking at the biggest level of international political collusion in history and i've said
[02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:27.360]  this thousands of times they change it to russia because they're bringing in globalism these
[02:39:27.360 --> 02:39:32.480]  multinational groups like tpp that literally do conquer us they're scared so they wanted to turn
[02:39:32.480 --> 02:39:38.480]  the investigation around and now it's blowing up in their face and now the e u army is announcing
[02:39:38.480 --> 02:39:44.320]  it's taking over and one day after five countries say they're ready to repel the invasion this is
[02:39:44.320 --> 02:39:49.440]  kind of shaping up almost like pre-world war two in a weird way you got yunker the air of the nazis
[02:39:49.440 --> 02:39:55.520]  threatening the us running the unelected e you how does this fit into your equation mr dent well
[02:39:55.520 --> 02:40:01.120]  you know again i've been waiting on this uh for 20 years now alex in the roaring 2000 my best-selling
[02:40:01.120 --> 02:40:08.080]  book i brought in this whole network revolution bottoms up now again free market capitalism
[02:40:08.080 --> 02:40:14.080]  and democracy with the first bottoms up revolution all history everything was top down aristocracy
[02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:22.880]  controlled since then this is deeper we've got back down with central banks have taken over
[02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:28.400]  and we need an economy globally that can let everybody be their own thing and grow from the
[02:40:28.400 --> 02:40:35.120]  bottom up like you said from organizations that you favor and not from some top down sort of thing
[02:40:35.120 --> 02:40:40.400]  all of this stuff can survive together if they all have their own spaces and their own support
[02:40:40.400 --> 02:40:45.040]  and the system can accommodate i was about to say won't won't the globalist themselves the good the
[02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:50.960]  bad the ugly destroy themselves making this existential fight with nationalism a real thing
[02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:55.360]  don't they get they're gonna lose we don't know okay they think they're gonna lose because they
[02:40:55.360 --> 02:41:00.160]  they're controlling things from the top down bottoms up to look the stock exchanges operate
[02:41:00.160 --> 02:41:05.600]  totally from the bottom's up not top down and they only get bigger and bigger you can have global
[02:41:05.600 --> 02:41:10.560]  and you can have bottom up what we have now is global and top down and that's the problem
[02:41:10.560 --> 02:41:15.680]  everything in this book everything i've written for 20 30 years has said we need a bottom's up
[02:41:15.680 --> 02:41:21.680]  revolution like in the late 1700s only information no i know you've been calling it you've been calling
[02:41:21.680 --> 02:41:26.560]  for 20 years i'm saying yeah how nasty is it gonna get because they've signaled they're gonna get very
[02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:33.840]  violent look it is getting out so we're saying you can't have a revolution look i mean they were
[02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:38.320]  cutting off heads in france and we had the revolutionary war in the united states it is
[02:41:38.320 --> 02:41:44.240]  nasty revolutions are never easy but they are necessary and they come at times like this again
[02:41:44.240 --> 02:41:50.560]  i can't stop the revolution i can't stop all the cycles i'm looking at all i can do is help people
[02:41:50.560 --> 02:41:56.160]  prepare for it again protect the wealth you have now at the top of this bubble don't hold out for
[02:41:56.160 --> 02:42:04.160]  more live in the safest place you can live in and be prepared for change and to take advantage of it
[02:42:04.160 --> 02:42:08.240]  it's just that simple there's going to be major breakdown major crime we've tried to prop this
[02:42:08.240 --> 02:42:13.440]  thing up but once it goes south they're going to unloose their their hordes the communist it's going

[02:47:52.480 --> 02:47:57.200]  with michael sabbage since he has the new book out god faith and reason even if we don't believe
[02:47:57.200 --> 02:48:05.520]  in god shouldn't you on this planetoid not want to treat other creatures worse than dog meat don't
[02:48:05.520 --> 02:48:12.160]  you have basic empathy we're getting godlike powers but we're not gods it's an incredible
[02:48:12.160 --> 02:48:18.960]  time to be alive and i've seen major demonization of drones for a decade because government didn't
[02:48:18.960 --> 02:48:23.760]  want the public to have access to them and then government though didn't want us to know it was
[02:48:23.760 --> 02:48:29.120]  going to use them as part of an autonomous army that would follow orders undersea drones
[02:48:30.880 --> 02:48:40.480]  ship drones airborne drones tank drones soldier drones but as miniaturization it's cheaper and
[02:48:40.480 --> 02:48:45.920]  cheaper and mass production gets cheaper and cheaper and better and better we're seeing the
[02:48:45.920 --> 02:48:50.080]  advent of the robots but then we see the footage of where the little robot that vacuums your house
[02:48:50.080 --> 02:48:54.080]  has got a camera in it and the hackers get in and watch it and have it go up in the front door for
[02:48:54.080 --> 02:49:01.200]  them or the hackers have it record what your codes are because it's grabbing the wi-fi so all of these
[02:49:01.200 --> 02:49:08.320]  trojan horses like the i-robot collects info in your house and then gives it to hackers all of
[02:49:08.320 --> 02:49:15.840]  this makes us less safe and it's all being rolled out with giant holes in it by design because industry
[02:49:15.840 --> 02:49:22.320]  wants into all of it and it's that data that has the real value the amount of data that one of these
[02:49:22.320 --> 02:49:27.760]  robot steals and gives back to the home company every time it's plugged into the internet because
[02:49:27.760 --> 02:49:30.800]  you keep it plugged in because you want to see what's going on your house when you're gone well
[02:49:30.800 --> 02:49:36.320]  there they're accessing it all they're even turning hotspots in your house into wi-fies for the companies
[02:49:36.320 --> 02:49:42.480]  to have unofficial wi-fies in neighborhoods passing on and monitoring info it's all a big space race
[02:49:43.360 --> 02:49:51.520]  or a run for the hills to get the gold the 49ers it's a gold rush and we're building
[02:49:54.000 --> 02:50:00.880]  our own graves with it because from the beginning it has an authoritarian and a deceptive architecture
[02:50:00.880 --> 02:50:06.880]  that's already beyond our understanding and we're just in the year 2017 so here's one this is the top
[02:50:06.880 --> 02:50:13.600]  video today on the internet the new spot mini robot boston dynamics sleek like a race car
[02:50:13.600 --> 02:50:22.160]  affordable cool everybody's got to have it but is there any discussion about what's inside of
[02:50:22.160 --> 02:50:27.840]  remember just five years ago people laughed at the spot robot that was gas powered in the military
[02:50:27.840 --> 02:50:32.000]  one and they oh that'll never be a threat and then now suddenly a few years later
[02:50:33.760 --> 02:50:38.080]  look out once that's weaponized and of course someone else will weaponize it so then a private
[02:50:38.080 --> 02:50:42.160]  group will so then let them have government control over all of them they'll all have to be wired into
[02:50:42.160 --> 02:50:50.400]  safety software which again allows them all to be hacked not just one one ring to rule them all
[02:50:50.400 --> 02:51:00.240]  one ring to bind them in the darkness my friends one central control and it's dystopic because
[02:51:00.240 --> 02:51:08.800]  it's designed to be dystopic let's go ahead and go to the new campaign but steward russell presented
[02:51:08.800 --> 02:51:13.120]  at the un convention on conventional weapons they're the ones that want to ban small arms with
[02:51:13.120 --> 02:51:20.320]  general citizens oh now they're going to warn us about swarms of droids swarms of drones
[02:51:20.320 --> 02:51:26.720]  coming and killing a classroom full of people not guns this is all because the un has said
[02:51:26.720 --> 02:51:31.280]  civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state
[02:51:31.280 --> 02:51:36.240]  they don't just like most drones for five years in restricted airspace they won't even fly they're
[02:51:36.240 --> 02:51:43.440]  already gps chipped then the f as well it's a big federal crime a felony if you fly it without and
[02:51:43.440 --> 02:51:49.840]  I could see how it causes a problem they've already had drones almost bring down jet liners but all
[02:51:49.840 --> 02:51:55.520]  the news fail safes only make it more centralized more easy for hackers or corrupt governments or
[02:51:55.520 --> 02:52:01.920]  whoever to control them all instead of one I'm not a big TV head but six seven eight years ago I
[02:52:01.920 --> 02:52:06.720]  watched on the treadmill one season of battle star galactica and you know the aliens have hacked into
[02:52:06.720 --> 02:52:11.040]  the mainframes the battle stars and they bring them all down at one minute invade kill everybody on
[02:52:11.040 --> 02:52:16.480]  earth and then there's one old battle star that isn't hooked in and it survives that's literally
[02:52:16.480 --> 02:52:22.880]  how this operates folks and so yeah calculators are great but they wouldn't notice how calculators
[02:52:22.880 --> 02:52:28.800]  when I was in school and I was good at math I could bang out algebra trigonometry whatever I
[02:52:28.800 --> 02:52:33.760]  needed to in the back of a piece of paper I could do do would work with a ruler and just figure it
[02:52:33.760 --> 02:52:40.000]  would all work great now I'm a blue blue blue my children doing homework they've got their calculators
[02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:45.680]  and I don't even know how the calculator works we're being dehumanized so here's the new film
[02:52:45.680 --> 02:52:50.560]  campaign to band developing autonomous weapons which little too late they've already launched it
[02:52:50.560 --> 02:53:00.080]  everywhere here it is just like any mobile device these days it has cameras and sensors it does facial
[02:53:00.080 --> 02:53:17.760]  recognition inside here is three grams of shaped explosive this is how it works
[02:53:20.240 --> 02:53:27.120]  that little bang is enough to penetrate the skull and destroy the content
[02:53:27.120 --> 02:53:34.320]  yeah what it has roughly is a bullet and so it flies up and it shoots you
[02:53:35.280 --> 02:53:40.000]  and so they're they're scaring one at the UN because the UN wants the global power to control
[02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:45.040]  this so when their peacekeepers show up to kill you you were never even allowed the basic technology
[02:53:45.040 --> 02:53:50.400]  to put up a resistance so the evil group is the one that wants to control it for your own good no
[02:53:50.400 --> 02:53:57.120]  let's continue with a piece I want to play more of it because I saw the full one where it shows
[02:53:57.120 --> 02:54:00.640]  them going and killing the kids in the school that was the one I wanted to play
[02:54:03.760 --> 02:54:08.720]  while we work on that let me just take a few minutes out here for you and just remind listeners
[02:54:08.720 --> 02:54:13.680]  and it is a reminder if you don't want to financially support the broadcast if you don't
[02:54:13.680 --> 02:54:16.800]  want to see us expand the face the globalist if you don't want to see us harm or people
[02:54:16.800 --> 02:54:22.800]  be more aggressive I don't think that's very good self-preservation activity I don't think so
[02:54:25.520 --> 02:54:29.280]  there isn't an organization or group that's under more attack other than the president
[02:54:30.720 --> 02:54:35.760]  drudge is under attack and others are we're under attack because we're just talking common sense
[02:54:35.760 --> 02:54:40.560]  we're having great guests on we're having real debates here and we're covering topics that they
[02:54:40.560 --> 02:54:48.240]  don't want discussed so I really hope that everyone will think about going to info or store.com and
[02:54:48.240 --> 02:54:52.800]  thinking about getting the new shirt that I think is the best we've ever produced really soft high

[02:55:18.960 --> 02:55:24.320]  go to an area like downtown austin or san francisco or somewhere else where there's fecal matter all
[02:55:24.320 --> 02:55:28.400]  of the ground heroin heads everywhere and huge disease outbreaks and people vomiting all over
[02:55:28.400 --> 02:55:34.080]  each other they may literally zombie like attack you so again won't tread on me the new shirt info

[02:56:29.600 --> 02:56:37.360]  here it is
[02:56:37.360 --> 02:56:41.440]  again it shows the swarm of these been unleashed by evil white men in a van of course everybody
[02:56:41.440 --> 02:56:46.880]  muslims and they go and they kill a whole class of people so they're saying you need to learn
[02:56:46.880 --> 02:56:55.440]  to be totally fearful and totally scared because the un wants to save you and the drone sees that
[02:56:55.440 --> 02:57:03.040]  he's alive authorities are still struggling to make sense of an attack on university campuses
[02:57:03.040 --> 02:57:10.240]  worldwide which targeted some students and not others who could have done this and anyone
[02:57:12.720 --> 02:57:18.320]  that's the guardian of the un and all their propaganda so there you go i've got one more
[02:57:18.320 --> 02:57:25.280]  clip i didn't get to how the vietnamese security firm has packed into an iphone x face id with a
[02:57:25.280 --> 02:57:32.080]  mask that cost them a couple dollars yeah all this technology is designed to be penetrated
[02:57:32.720 --> 02:57:38.160]  because the big tech companies are the hackers they want to bring in the total grid have it all

[03:00:12.080 --> 03:00:18.640]  this is just in my list of videos today anti-trump are arrested for planning a killing spree of
[03:00:18.640 --> 03:00:24.960]  trump supporters left us who wanted to kill first responders found with an arsenal of bombs and
[03:00:24.960 --> 03:00:30.000]  weapons told his parents who he lived with at 31 that he was going to go out nothing wrong live
[03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:34.480]  with your parents but i mean all these people do we're going to go out and kill trump supporters
[03:00:35.600 --> 03:00:42.400]  and then i've had this lady on the broadcast before transgender activists libertarian
[03:00:43.280 --> 03:00:50.080]  blare white was assaulted on the hollywood boulevard for sporting a make america grading in hat a
[03:00:50.080 --> 03:00:57.600]  social experiment gone awry they also broke her nail grabbed her hand viciously she wanted to see
[03:00:57.600 --> 03:01:01.760]  what would happen well it's like when i go out one of these areas they attack me and it was two beta
[03:01:01.760 --> 03:01:07.360]  males attacking what you know you disagree it's a woman a man whatever it's an attractive looking
[03:01:07.360 --> 03:01:12.480]  woman i mean these are guys thinking they're attacking a woman you can debate whether you know
[03:01:12.480 --> 03:01:16.640]  she's a man the thing she's one whatever it doesn't matter to me i don't hate her as long as she
[03:01:16.640 --> 03:01:23.520]  doesn't hate me and the point is is that the left then attacks a woman that they don't like here it is
[03:01:27.680 --> 03:01:35.200]  radio audience walking through busy area doing nothing wearing the hat make america great again
[03:01:35.200 --> 03:01:39.360]  and they're what do they represent make america and she's there with her boyfriend
[03:01:39.360 --> 03:01:47.600]  yeah all his purposes is a gay couple can't wear their hat and you've got some guys wearing the
[03:01:48.400 --> 03:01:59.040]  pussycat hats and he there is a tiger grabbing the hat away and the police just let him break her
[03:01:59.040 --> 03:02:11.600]  nail look at this guy i guess she went out there for the fascism march pro fascism march
[03:02:11.600 --> 03:02:18.480]  so there you go there is the tolerance uh ladies and gentlemen i mean again thanks she's a woman
[03:02:18.480 --> 03:02:23.440]  there's there's no doubt they think it's a woman i've noticed wheelchair woman handicapped person
[03:02:23.440 --> 03:02:31.440]  they attack and it's guys wearing pink hat saying we want to be feminine and then they
[03:02:31.440 --> 03:02:37.120]  attack basically they're they're they're archetype a man that's become a woman because she's wearing
[03:02:37.120 --> 03:02:47.200]  the wrong hat they're so tolerant they'll attack a woman amazing now i want to move on to this
[03:02:47.200 --> 03:02:55.600]  other clip here there's so many man migrants being sold by islamists as slaves but the
[03:02:55.600 --> 03:03:00.800]  don't point out they're muslims that's cnn we've got a bunch of other clips here i didn't get to
[03:03:00.800 --> 03:03:07.200]  it's just totally insane that it's gotten this point there's so much i didn't get to today
[03:03:09.920 --> 03:03:13.600]  i've got how the iphone can be broken into really really easy we don't have time to get to that
[03:03:13.600 --> 03:03:21.600]  we've got the sessions testimony we've got the trump rollout that they're promoting in the media
[03:03:21.600 --> 03:03:26.800]  it's just incredible oh i know the clip i want to play let's play the clip of the lady that's raised
[03:03:26.800 --> 03:03:33.440]  over 75 000 on the gofundme site steve watson wrote about this for info wars dot com after she
[03:03:33.440 --> 03:03:39.120]  flipped off trump she became such a hero for flipping off his motorcade that they've given her
[03:03:39.120 --> 03:03:44.880]  75 000 and i'm telling you that's all they can do is attack you or scream f you uh here is that
[03:03:44.880 --> 03:03:50.960]  clip a gofundme campaign growing for the cyclist who was fired after flipping off president trump's
[03:03:50.960 --> 03:03:58.560]  motorcade more than 70 000 now raised for julie briskman the gofundme calling her a quote inspiration
[03:03:58.560 --> 03:04:03.200]  to us all briskman claims that her employer a government contractor fired her for violating
[03:04:03.200 --> 03:04:08.960]  the company's social media policy you know i say i don't even fire somebody like that don't be like
[03:04:08.960 --> 03:04:13.760]  the left who fires and physically attacks everybody but then you know we got to get out of their level
[03:04:13.760 --> 03:04:19.520]  sometime i guess but just how they kick their kids out the rallies too and just cuss and scream and
[03:04:19.520 --> 03:04:25.040]  attack and it's just a bunch of spoiled rotten babies that have lived in this cuddled country
[03:04:25.040 --> 03:04:31.520]  forever who just want to dominate it want to run our lives and i'm sorry you're not going to run our

[03:06:12.720 --> 03:06:17.280]  thanks alex it is the fourth hour of the alex jones show got a ton of needs coming up
[03:06:17.280 --> 03:06:24.080]  first i want to start off with central theme which is the war on christmas now remember
[03:06:24.080 --> 03:06:30.800]  10 15 years ago this is something that bill o'reilly these are the neocons would constantly bring up
[03:06:30.800 --> 03:06:36.000]  people would uh debunk it and say it's a it's a false concern it's being exaggerated there's no
[03:06:36.000 --> 03:06:42.640]  war on christmas what are you talking about this is crazy well fast forward to 2017 a little bit
[03:06:42.640 --> 03:06:49.520]  of a different story of course last week we had the release of the tesco christmas ad tesco is
[03:06:49.520 --> 03:06:55.440]  basically the uk u k equivalent of walmart is the biggest supermarket chain in the country
[03:06:55.440 --> 03:07:00.240]  one of the biggest corporations in the world they of course released a christmas ad they called it
[03:07:00.240 --> 03:07:06.000]  a christmas ad or at least it was supposed to be that didn't have any symbols of christianity
[03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:14.480]  in the ad whatsoever it did have a gay couple hijabi muslims all this other goth no actual christian
[03:07:14.480 --> 03:07:19.760]  symbol because of course we can't have that anymore can we you've seen the yogurt products from all
[03:07:19.760 --> 03:07:26.000]  these different companies where they have to airbrush out crosses on the top of christian churches
[03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:33.200]  because god forbid somebody somewhere might be offended they see the christmas ad tesco ad
[03:07:33.200 --> 03:07:39.200]  that's causing all the controversy in this country over the past week of course there was a backlash
[03:07:39.200 --> 03:07:46.000]  to the backlash which basically peaked yesterday with twitter twitter came out and said this was
[03:07:46.000 --> 03:07:50.880]  one of their featured stories in their twitter moments which of course is on the home page
[03:07:50.880 --> 03:07:57.840]  when anybody goes onto twitter so a ton of people would have seen this they said that this was the
[03:07:57.840 --> 03:08:05.200]  actual twitter moment i'll read from it they said people are loving the diversity in the tesco
[03:08:05.200 --> 03:08:10.560]  christmas ad this was on the front page of twitter everybody saw this on twitter yesterday
[03:08:10.560 --> 03:08:17.200]  it says tesco's christmas advert features a gay couple and a muslim family enjoying the season
[03:08:17.200 --> 03:08:24.160]  whatever that means the advert has drawn mixed reactions but most viewers most viewers seem
[03:08:24.160 --> 03:08:31.840]  overjoyed like who on earth would be overjoyed by a commercial but this is what they said
[03:08:31.840 --> 03:08:40.480]  most viewers seem overjoyed at the diverse representation okay that is fake news in fact
[03:08:40.480 --> 03:08:47.120]  i tweeted about it you go on to the youtube version of this christmas ad this new tesco christmas ad
[03:08:47.120 --> 03:08:55.600]  four thousand thumbs down one thousand thumbs up a four to one thumbs down to thumbs up ratio
[03:08:55.600 --> 03:09:02.960]  that does not mean people are loving it that's a complete lie that is fake news certainly doesn't
[03:09:02.960 --> 03:09:08.160]  mean that anybody's overjoyed by it look at that it's down six to three k now so they've managed
[03:09:08.160 --> 03:09:13.200]  to get it up a little bit only six thousand thumbs down to three so now it's two to one
[03:09:13.200 --> 03:09:20.080]  no but is that being overjoyed is that people loving the ad no the vast majority of people
[03:09:20.080 --> 03:09:25.520]  don't like it there've been newspaper articles about it all week well paul this is cultural
[03:09:25.520 --> 03:09:31.040]  appropriation this is what the left's all about is overriding taking control of everything dominating
[03:09:31.040 --> 03:09:37.840]  culture well alex it doesn't even make sense muslims don't celebrate christmas all the all
[03:09:37.840 --> 03:09:42.880]  the headlines like oh you're so offended at seeing muslims it's like no i'm offended at the fact or
[03:09:42.880 --> 03:09:48.560]  i'm perplexed at the fact there's no like if you had an ad saying this this holiday season
[03:09:48.560 --> 03:09:53.520]  support ramadan at your local hall all stores and then it showed guys at night's template
[03:09:53.520 --> 03:10:00.000]  uniforms at the muslim store buying goat brands and they're like oh why are you so offended by
[03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:06.240]  nobody really cares just at least like put a vicar in it or something across anything christian
[03:10:06.240 --> 03:10:10.560]  it's a christmas ad for god's sake but here's the kicker it's like having a christmas ad where
[03:10:10.560 --> 03:10:17.680]  you drag santa claus behind a car yeah i went into tesco on saturday went to the christmas
[03:10:17.680 --> 03:10:23.760]  section of the store not one mention of christmas they don't even mention the word christ they've
[03:10:23.760 --> 03:10:30.240]  got these christmas cards alex they call them they've renamed them they're now called charity cards
[03:10:30.240 --> 03:10:35.440]  oh you gotta go back in and get some footage of this well i've got the pictures and i tweet them
[03:10:35.440 --> 03:10:40.480]  but people said oh that's because a portion of the proceeds are donated to charity yeah that's
[03:10:40.480 --> 03:10:46.320]  always been the case but they were called christmas cards okay they've changed the name of christmas
[03:10:46.320 --> 03:10:52.880]  cards to charity cards and this is in one store okay so all these people who oh you know i went to
[03:10:52.880 --> 03:10:57.120]  a tesco store in a completely different part of the country and found the word christmas yeah
[03:10:57.120 --> 03:11:03.040]  i'm not talking about that i'm talking about the store that i went in they had crackers it said six
[03:11:03.040 --> 03:11:08.480]  crackers they don't call them christmas crackers anymore they had a ton of confectionary chocolate
[03:11:08.480 --> 03:11:15.360]  sweets that didn't say christmas anywhere on the packaging they're deliberately exising out the word
[03:11:15.360 --> 03:11:22.960]  they are memory-holding christmas they are banning the word yeah and it's obviously a lame nod to
[03:11:22.960 --> 03:11:28.160]  political correctness it's not this oh everyone's welcome that's how they sell it alex everyone's
[03:11:28.160 --> 03:11:33.520]  welcome now muslims don't care about christmas they don't celebrate it and they're not going to get
[03:11:33.520 --> 03:11:38.960]  offended if you don't put them in a christmas hat this is a bunch of guilty self-guilt tripping white
[03:11:38.960 --> 03:11:44.560]  people on the far left who are doing this and they're literally undermining our culture now we're
[03:11:44.560 --> 03:11:50.800]  i mean this is not some kind of bill o'reilly meme from the early 2000s anymore this is actually
[03:11:50.800 --> 03:11:56.160]  happening there's a headline up on the guardian threats to boycott tesco after muslim family
[03:11:56.160 --> 03:12:01.760]  features in christmas hat again completely misrepresenting the source of the controversy
[03:12:01.760 --> 03:12:08.160]  which was that back there were no christian symbols in the entire ad for christmas just like the
[03:12:08.160 --> 03:12:13.920]  yoghurt companies the big yoghurt companies have have shut it out they've airbrushed out
[03:12:14.640 --> 03:12:18.480]  the crosses on top of the christian churches when they sell their products because god forbid it
[03:12:18.480 --> 03:12:25.200]  might offend somebody this is a deliberate or welly in process of eliminating words changing
[03:12:25.200 --> 03:12:30.880]  language for the purposes of some lame nod at political correctness and it's it's chilling
[03:12:30.880 --> 03:12:36.160]  and we should be angry about this and yeah there are some tesco stores across the country which
[03:12:36.160 --> 03:12:42.720]  will have some things that say christmas but they're gradually airbrushing it out and it's insidious
[03:12:43.440 --> 03:12:48.640]  here's another headline again proving that the war on christmas is not some right-wing conspiracy
[03:12:48.640 --> 03:12:55.760]  theory voice of europe reports paris cancels christmas market holds special ramadan party
[03:12:55.760 --> 03:13:01.440]  every year now this is a christmas market in paris that i've been to on several occasions massive
[03:13:02.160 --> 03:13:09.600]  cultural icon of a festivity no longer going to exist the sean's lee's a christmas market in paris
[03:13:10.160 --> 03:13:16.480]  sean's lee's a central paris iconic area has been cancelled by city hall council as it's
[03:13:16.480 --> 03:13:23.840]  considered the city's main christmas market and welcomes 15 million visitors every year hugely
[03:13:23.840 --> 03:13:30.320]  successful globally renowned it's gone according to a spokesperson of the city hall the french
[03:13:30.320 --> 03:13:35.120]  capital wants to vote this is a quote wants to focus on offering visitors and parisians
[03:13:35.120 --> 03:13:40.080]  more attractive and innovative events that will enhance the sean's lee's a in a cultural
[03:13:40.080 --> 03:13:44.800]  and aesthetic dimension in keeping with this exceptional side oh so you're all bothered
[03:13:44.800 --> 03:13:51.200]  our aesthetics meanwhile you're literally building a wall around the eiffel tower because islam's is
[03:13:51.200 --> 03:13:58.720]  such a massive religion of peace oh but now you care about aesthetics okay since 2008 this market
[03:13:58.720 --> 03:14:02.720]  in paris has been organized by marcel campion but due to long-term dispute the contract was
[03:14:02.720 --> 03:14:07.600]  terminated this year according to john france why martin deputy mayor in charge of tourism
[03:14:07.600 --> 03:14:13.760]  market wasn't good enough for paris so they've cancelled this but of course uh the daily street
[03:14:13.760 --> 03:14:18.240]  prayers where they literally have a call to prayer at five a.m and go and kneel on the street that
[03:14:18.240 --> 03:14:26.400]  will continue another one french top court bans christian nativity scenes from public spaces
[03:14:26.400 --> 03:14:30.880]  christmas nativity scenes the french council of state has ruled for a ban on christmas nativity
[03:14:30.880 --> 03:14:38.400]  scenes in public spaces unless special circumstances show that this has a cultural artistic or festive
[03:14:38.400 --> 03:14:44.960]  purpose so you can't just have a christmas festivity nativity scene in public for the sake of oh i
[03:14:44.960 --> 03:14:50.640]  don't know where a christ where a christian country this is the very foundation of our entire society
[03:14:50.640 --> 03:14:55.520]  no that's not a good enough reason you have to prove that it's diverse enough that it's
[03:14:55.520 --> 03:15:01.760]  representative enough culturally and we're gonna ban it because you can't prove that the decision
[03:15:01.760 --> 03:15:07.520]  of the council of state relates to the nativity scene that the mayor of bezier robert menard
[03:15:07.520 --> 03:15:14.080]  had installed in 2014 in 2015 16 a crash was again installed but with a more cultural and
[03:15:14.080 --> 03:15:20.560]  festive dimension because you can't just you can't just have a christian nativity scene with a baby
[03:15:20.560 --> 03:15:26.800]  jesus and whatever no no that's that might offend somebody ban it ban it it was accompanied by a
[03:15:26.800 --> 03:15:31.680]  christmas tree can't have that ban that and a mailbox to write so santa claus so even like
[03:15:31.680 --> 03:15:36.720]  the non christian stuff there's more commercial stuff the santa claus the christmas tree or
[03:15:36.720 --> 03:15:42.640]  whatever which is actually pagan even that they're even banning that because it might offend somebody
[03:15:42.640 --> 03:15:48.800]  okay here's another one this was last year and we're gonna see more of this i'll get into it

[03:20:23.040 --> 03:20:28.560]  if you want to subvert undermine and eventually overthrow western civilization which is what
[03:20:28.560 --> 03:20:33.520]  the far left wants to do even though many of them don't know it they're useful idiots then you've
[03:20:33.520 --> 03:20:40.560]  got to take down christianity because it's the fundamental fundamental underpinning of western
[03:20:40.560 --> 03:20:46.800]  society and this is the process that we see right now with the encroachment of islam not
[03:20:46.800 --> 03:20:54.480]  just radical islam but mass islamic immigration and yet in most cases those who are supposedly
[03:20:54.480 --> 03:20:59.040]  were told might be offended by any of this they're not even a feather they even care
[03:20:59.040 --> 03:21:04.800]  is other people getting offended on their behalf we've seen it with the yoghurt companies little
[03:21:04.800 --> 03:21:12.160]  nestly airbrushing christian crosses from the yoghurt packaging i mean most people
[03:21:12.160 --> 03:21:17.760]  wouldn't even notice it anyway if you go to my twitter i just retweeted an example of that
[03:21:17.760 --> 03:21:24.240]  before and after shot it's the it's a church in greece they've airbrushed it out because it had
[03:21:24.240 --> 03:21:30.480]  a cross on top of the church for yoghurt for yoghurt there you see it absolutely incredible
[03:21:30.480 --> 03:21:37.360]  so tesco's come out with this christmas ad that has no christian symbols in it whatsoever the media
[03:21:37.360 --> 03:21:42.960]  took that spun it and said oh look at all these bigots offended because there were some hijabi
[03:21:42.960 --> 03:21:48.720]  muslims in the advert no that's not the point the point is why are you putting muslims in a
[03:21:48.720 --> 03:21:54.160]  christmas advert they don't celebrate christmas they don't care number two where are the christian
[03:21:54.160 --> 03:22:01.440]  symbols all right you've got gay dads in there fair enough whatever put at least put a cross in there
[03:22:01.440 --> 03:22:05.920]  i mean come on and then twitter comes out and outright lies and say people are loving the
[03:22:05.920 --> 03:22:13.520]  diversity and the new tesco ad gone youtube 6000 thumbs down as of now compared to 3000 thumbs up
[03:22:13.520 --> 03:22:20.320]  no people are not loving it the clear majority of people hate it because they see this gradual
[03:22:20.320 --> 03:22:28.160]  orwellian erosion of tradition of culture of language and it's insidious it's no longer
[03:22:28.160 --> 03:22:33.920]  some bill o'reilly meme when it's actually happening france has banned nativity scenes in public
[03:22:33.920 --> 03:22:40.640]  spaces we had this story last year out of the express out of germany it's going to be replicated
[03:22:40.640 --> 03:22:46.400]  even more so again this year remember this is the around the time that an islamic terrorist migrant
[03:22:46.400 --> 03:22:52.160]  unbarreled a truck through a christmas market in berlin killing what over a dozen people
[03:22:52.160 --> 03:22:58.240]  enduring dozens more these are who we're capitulating to this is the great capitulation
[03:22:58.240 --> 03:23:04.640]  we're witnessing right now christmas banned from being mentioned on menu over fears it would offend
[03:23:05.280 --> 03:23:10.800]  muslims christmas streets have been taken off a menu and replaced with winter delicacies
[03:23:10.800 --> 03:23:15.520]  over fears the phrase would offend muslims function held at the austrian embassy in germany
[03:23:15.520 --> 03:23:21.760]  still serve traditional festive bear but rebranded them as winter delicacy so you can't even serve
[03:23:22.800 --> 03:23:29.680]  food that's called christmas because it might offend a muslim you know like the asan bernadino
[03:23:29.680 --> 03:23:34.320]  killers were offended by the christmas party we don't want to offend those kind of people do we
[03:23:35.200 --> 03:23:42.240]  here's another one out of germany again we are a muslim business woolworth store cancels christmas
[03:23:42.240 --> 03:23:47.360]  over islamic customers woolworth has cancelled christmas in one of its german stores after
[03:23:47.360 --> 03:23:51.520]  claiming it's only remaining customers are muslim the former high street favorite went
[03:23:51.520 --> 03:23:57.440]  boss seven years ago in the uk but still operates 300 stores in germany and a row broke out after
[03:23:57.440 --> 03:24:03.040]  staff at a branch in dotman decided not to bother with christmas decorations gifts or music this
[03:24:03.040 --> 03:24:10.000]  year because it's now essentially a muslim store shocked locals found out of the christmas section
[03:24:10.000 --> 03:24:15.120]  which featured featured decorations gifts and festive treats such as chocolate for the christmas
[03:24:15.840 --> 03:24:21.760]  don't call it for the christmas was removed just a few after just a few days on display so
[03:24:21.760 --> 03:24:27.840]  that was because it was essentially in a muslim ghetto they just got rid of it i mean what i mean
[03:24:27.840 --> 03:24:34.000]  perhaps tesco shouldn't really be having christmas sections at all they shouldn't be selling
[03:24:34.000 --> 03:24:38.880]  christmas cards or charity cards as they're called now they shouldn't be selling crackers they
[03:24:38.880 --> 03:24:44.800]  shouldn't be selling wrapping paper that might offend a muslim decorations tinsel baubles that
[03:24:44.800 --> 03:24:50.000]  might offend somebody i think is that's i think i'm starting to get triggered by the fact they
[03:24:50.000 --> 03:24:55.440]  they've even got a christmas section i mean think of the precious muslims you might offend them
[03:24:56.160 --> 03:25:00.880]  in fact that's actually a narrative that we've seen from the left don't offend the muslims it
[03:25:00.880 --> 03:25:07.440]  might turn them into terrorists what first of all that's the most islamophobic thing you could
[03:25:07.440 --> 03:25:14.640]  ever say because it's introducing the premise that you can just turn a muslim into a terrorist by
[03:25:14.640 --> 03:25:19.120]  making them upset which kind of gives you a clue that it's that's quite easy for them to become
[03:25:19.120 --> 03:25:26.160]  terrorists in the first place very bigoted very islamophobic as is christmas sections all in
[03:25:26.160 --> 03:25:32.560]  supermarkets get rid of them all ban everything ban christmas trees ban santa claus someone
[03:25:32.560 --> 03:25:38.800]  might be offended and if you've got a video on youtube of a christmas ad without any christian
[03:25:38.800 --> 03:25:44.960]  symbols in it like tesco does and it's got 6000 thumbs down compared to only 3000 thumbs up just
[03:25:44.960 --> 03:25:50.720]  say everybody's loving it just just lie through your teeth on the front page of twitter and say
[03:25:50.720 --> 03:25:55.200]  everybody loves it it's so diverse everybody's loving it they're overjoyed that was the word
[03:25:55.200 --> 03:26:00.400]  they literally used twitter said people were overjoyed yeah 6000 thumbs down that that's

[03:33:20.160 --> 03:33:29.360]  live it is a fourth hour of the alex jones show i'm gonna go to a video now which just went up on
[03:33:29.360 --> 03:33:36.000]  info wars dot com about an hour ago which i put out about this transgender individual who's also
[03:33:36.000 --> 03:33:44.080]  claiming that he's transracial this is a white guy this is a chubby pasty white guy born a man
[03:33:44.080 --> 03:33:48.240]  he's not even making the effort to look like a woman although he claims he's transgender
[03:33:48.240 --> 03:33:54.560]  he also claims that he's transracial and that he's filipino he's made decidedly less effort
[03:33:54.560 --> 03:34:00.960]  to be transracial compared to uh rachel dolezal who of course the mainstream media came out and
[03:34:00.960 --> 03:34:08.000]  elements of it celebrated her melissa harris perry as you'll see in this clip got up on msnbc and said
[03:34:08.000 --> 03:34:13.360]  yeah i think it is possible for people to just become black even if they were born white with
[03:34:13.360 --> 03:34:19.760]  ginger hair just you know because they feel black they actually signed on to some of that insanity
[03:34:19.760 --> 03:34:27.280]  and this is taking it to a new level this is uh the transgender guy who thinks he's a filipino here's
[03:34:27.280 --> 03:34:36.320]  the clip man says he's transracial oh god not this again this milky white tub of lard born adam
[03:34:36.320 --> 03:34:41.680]  says he now identifies as a filipino woman called jar do whenever i'm around the music
[03:34:41.680 --> 03:34:48.320]  i'm around the food i feel like i'm in my own skin yeah you're about as filipino as rachel
[03:34:48.320 --> 03:34:57.360]  dolezal is african-american are you african-american and who was born white but believes that he is
[03:34:57.360 --> 03:35:03.040]  filipino there are just so many questions here you're the news why are you treating this as a
[03:35:03.040 --> 03:35:08.080]  real news story what's wrong with you so many questions here but why it gets worse they talked
[03:35:08.080 --> 03:35:13.440]  to a psychologist who instead of having a normal reaction you know laughing uncontrollably for
[03:35:13.440 --> 03:35:21.920]  minutes on end actually legitimize this moron's feverish delusion are they hurting you are they
[03:35:21.920 --> 03:35:28.960]  hurting anyone else are they hurting themselves and are they just trying to be who they feel
[03:35:28.960 --> 03:35:33.760]  they are inside they're going to be happier okay so i've decided that i'm a black single mother
[03:35:33.760 --> 03:35:38.560]  with eight children can i take advantage of affirmative action can i get welfare i mean
[03:35:38.560 --> 03:35:43.600]  this is who i feel i am on the inside and i'm not hurting anyone so who are you to tell me i can't
[03:35:43.600 --> 03:35:48.880]  be happy but it's like at least rachel dolezal made the effort she blacked up and put her hair in
[03:35:48.880 --> 03:35:54.800]  cornrows what's this guy done died his hair pink and bought a tuck tuck hasn't even made the effort
[03:35:54.800 --> 03:36:00.080]  to look like a woman never mind filipino at least the girl who claims she's a cat born in a human
[03:36:00.080 --> 03:36:05.360]  body commits to it i'd watch the history channel sometimes for hours oh but he's watched the
[03:36:05.360 --> 03:36:10.640]  history channel okay i've watched some kids television and now i identify as barney the purple
[03:36:10.640 --> 03:36:23.840]  dinosaur you know i had to make sure that it wasn't just me because if it's just me then there
[03:36:23.840 --> 03:36:28.560]  must be something wrong or maybe i'm just maybe i'm just strange yeah if we can agree on one thing
[03:36:28.560 --> 03:36:33.840]  mate it's that you're strange but hey when you've got pundits on actual mainstream news shows saying
[03:36:33.840 --> 03:36:40.000]  that you can just become black if you feel like it then all bets are off but is it possible
[03:36:40.000 --> 03:36:46.080]  that she might actually be black and there's actually a different category of blackness
[03:36:46.080 --> 03:36:51.360]  that is about the achievement of blackness despite one's parentage is that possible it's
[03:36:51.360 --> 03:36:56.320]  absolutely possible so if i wear a sombrero on halloween i'm guilty of cultural appropriation
[03:36:56.320 --> 03:37:01.520]  but if i just start walking around claiming to be mexican that's okay this is the bed you
[03:37:01.520 --> 03:37:07.680]  progressives have made with this everything is a social construct crap so it's time to lie in it
[03:37:07.680 --> 03:37:12.640]  if you're gonna claim that men can have babies that gender is fluid and a person's gender identity
[03:37:12.640 --> 03:37:17.200]  may change over their lifetime the infants shouldn't be assigned a sex at birth if you're
[03:37:17.200 --> 03:37:23.920]  gonna claim that biological science no longer matters and that when all on a spectrum then you
[03:37:23.920 --> 03:37:28.960]  can't argue against this freak's claim that she's a reptile you can't argue against this weirdo's
[03:37:28.960 --> 03:37:35.760]  claim that he's a six-year-old girl i um have a mommy and daddy a adopted mommy and daddy who are
[03:37:35.760 --> 03:37:41.760]  totally comfortable with me being a little girl you can't argue against this idiot's claim that he's
[03:37:41.760 --> 03:37:56.080]  filipino embrace it because you're responsible for all this insanity time to own it this man says
[03:37:56.080 --> 03:38:02.000]  he's trans that is the video that just went up on info wars dot com earlier get it out there
[03:38:02.720 --> 03:38:08.000]  of course if you're gonna start off on the premise of everything being a social construct
[03:38:08.000 --> 03:38:12.320]  you're gonna run into trouble and now you're running into big trouble with these people
[03:38:12.320 --> 03:38:17.920]  claiming that they pour drain cleaner in their eyes to be trendy that that's just what they
[03:38:17.920 --> 03:38:23.680]  identify as don't you dare call it a mental illness if that's what makes them happy don't be a bigger
[03:38:23.680 --> 03:38:31.680]  okay you own that narrative now well done cnn reports barbie's first hijab meet the new
[03:38:31.680 --> 03:38:38.320]  ibaj muhammad doll matel which makes barbie announced monday the latest doll in its shiro
[03:38:38.320 --> 03:38:45.440]  shiro collection will be modeled after olympic fencer ibaj muhammad in 2016 muhammad became the
[03:38:45.440 --> 03:38:50.560]  first american to compete in the games while wearing a hijab she said i'm proud to know that
[03:38:50.560 --> 03:38:56.960]  little girls everywhere can now play with a barbie who chooses to wear hijab this is a childhood
[03:38:56.960 --> 03:39:02.560]  dream come true the news was announced at glamour's women of the year summit the doll will go on sale
[03:39:02.560 --> 03:39:08.400]  in 2018 barbie has been working hard to make sure its collection of dolls are more diverse in an
[03:39:08.400 --> 03:39:15.680]  effort to broaden the brand's appeal now where did this barbie hijab barbie idea originate from
[03:39:15.680 --> 03:39:20.880]  did it originate from this olympic athlete no it originated from feminist because we
[03:39:20.880 --> 03:39:28.400]  reported on it before that they were pressuring matel into creating a hijab barbie because again
[03:39:28.400 --> 03:39:35.280]  they were basically fearful of trump's election and thought that it would herald a new islamophobic
[03:39:35.280 --> 03:39:40.640]  purge in america of course nothing like that has happened but again this came from feminists
[03:39:41.360 --> 03:39:47.600]  didn't come from muslim groups it came from predominantly white feminist leftist groups
[03:39:47.600 --> 03:39:52.720]  who have sided with islam despite the fact that islam is the most misogynistic sexist
[03:39:52.720 --> 03:40:00.560]  belief system on the planet and by the way that's what arab feminist groups a hundred years ago
[03:40:00.560 --> 03:40:06.560]  thought because it was the egyptian feminist union one of the first feminist groups in existence
[03:40:06.560 --> 03:40:14.800]  in that part of the world that discarded their hijabs as a form of protest so the very first
[03:40:14.800 --> 03:40:22.160]  muslim arab feminist group in the middle east discarded their hijabs let that sink in a hundred
[03:40:22.160 --> 03:40:29.280]  years ago they knew it was a symbol of oppression a hundred years later cnn and all the rest of
[03:40:29.280 --> 03:40:37.440]  these dominant cultural institutions are presenting it as a symbol of feminism coming as it does from
[03:40:37.440 --> 03:40:42.400]  the same part of the world that literally gave birth to something called the rape game which of
[03:40:42.400 --> 03:40:47.600]  course we saw in egypt with laura logan and which of course we've seen imported into the west on the
[03:40:47.600 --> 03:40:54.080]  wave of islamic immigration which has brought with it skyrocketing sexual assault figures
[03:40:54.080 --> 03:41:00.480]  the mass molestation of women in major cities like cologne of course what did the feminists
[03:41:00.480 --> 03:41:06.240]  do in cologne the day after the event the day after what a thousand predominantly moroccan
[03:41:06.240 --> 03:41:12.080]  muslim migrants molested 2000 women what did the feminists do did they protest against the migrants
[03:41:12.080 --> 03:41:17.360]  for importing their rape culture no they went down to the local migrant center and gave the
[03:41:17.360 --> 03:41:24.160]  migrants flowers that's how the feminists responded to the mass molestation of women oh and by the
[03:41:24.160 --> 03:41:31.280]  way you know what muslim syrian women do in areas of syria that have been liberated from isis what's
[03:41:31.280 --> 03:41:39.440]  the first thing they do they discard their hijab because isis enforces stringent rules on islamic
[03:41:39.440 --> 03:41:45.600]  headwear they make everybody wear a burqa at least if not the full face covering they discard the
[03:41:45.600 --> 03:41:52.000]  veils when they're liberated from isis but cnn feminists all these dominant cultural institutions
[03:41:52.000 --> 03:41:57.760]  want you to believe it's trendy all right all right don't listen to me listen to azra q
[03:41:57.760 --> 03:42:03.760]  nomani the founder of the muslim reform movement she wrote that the hijab is quote a symbol of a
[03:42:03.760 --> 03:42:10.160]  dangerous purity culture obsessed with honor and virginity that has divided muslim communities in
[03:42:10.160 --> 03:42:15.440]  her own civil war because again this is not me saying this this is the head of the muslim reform
[03:42:15.440 --> 03:42:21.600]  movement since the saudi and iranian regimes promulgated puritanical interpretations of sunni
[03:42:21.600 --> 03:42:29.040]  and she islam after the 1970s saudi oil boom and the 79 iranian revolution and she lists numerous
[03:42:29.040 --> 03:42:34.800]  examples where this purity culture has resulted the deaths of young women and girls we'll get

[03:47:15.520 --> 03:47:28.080]  and now your host paul joseph watson so matel has released their first hijab barbie having been
[03:47:28.080 --> 03:47:33.680]  directed to but having been directed to by actual feminists who of course have sided with islam the
[03:47:33.680 --> 03:47:39.680]  most misogynistic belief system on the planet and we were talking about how the hijab is not
[03:47:39.680 --> 03:47:45.200]  a symbol of feminism again no matter how hard they try and sell that propaganda the hijab is not
[03:47:45.200 --> 03:47:52.320]  a symbol of feminism we were talking about asra q namani the founder of the muslim reform movement
[03:47:52.320 --> 03:47:56.880]  oh by the way the first arab feminist muslim groups in the middle east discarded the hijab
[03:47:56.880 --> 03:48:02.560]  they saw it as a symbol of oppression a hundred years ago but now cnn says it's cool trendy and
[03:48:02.560 --> 03:48:07.760]  diverse and it's it's a feminist symbol okay let's listen to what asra namani says she cites
[03:48:07.760 --> 03:48:13.840]  examples of this hijab purity culture and how it's led to the deaths of young women and girls
[03:48:13.840 --> 03:48:21.280]  recently in barreilly india a father killed his daughter four years old smashing her head against
[03:48:21.280 --> 03:48:27.520]  the floor when her scarf slipped from her head during dinner in ontario a few years ago a man
[03:48:27.520 --> 03:48:34.480]  strangled his 16 year old sister when she defied their father including by refusing to cover her hair
[03:48:35.520 --> 03:48:40.960]  back in november last year a former university of missouri instructor dragged a female relative aged
[03:48:40.960 --> 03:48:48.160]  14 out of school by the hair when he discovered she hadn't covered her hair today in iran friends of
[03:48:48.160 --> 03:48:54.880]  the journalist mahesh alan ajad dodge batons as they shoot photos of themselves hair bear in a
[03:48:54.880 --> 03:49:01.120]  campaign alan ajad started my stealthy freedom to protest against iran's mandatory headscarf law
[03:49:01.120 --> 03:49:06.000]  you've seen the pictures we shared them in the past women in iran muslim women take off their veil
[03:49:06.000 --> 03:49:12.400]  as a form of protest they're protesting for actual feminist freedom because they ran in
[03:49:12.400 --> 03:49:18.320]  forces and draconian law making them wear a headscarf so all across the middle east the hijab
[03:49:18.320 --> 03:49:25.600]  is a sign of oppression it's a sign of the actual patriarchy and now it's being promoted by feminist
[03:49:25.600 --> 03:49:30.560]  you want to talk about toxic masculinity that's the only place in which it exists really in the
[03:49:30.560 --> 03:49:37.440]  world few other places but mainly there and you're promoting the very symbol of toxic masculinity
[03:49:38.080 --> 03:49:43.840]  by claiming it's some kind of feminist symbol it's not the women in syria liberated from isis
[03:49:43.840 --> 03:49:50.400]  discard their veil because isis makes them wear it it's not a feminist symbol it's not a symbol
[03:49:50.400 --> 03:49:57.680]  of freedom to cover up women i see like four five-year-old kids running around in hijabs
[03:49:57.680 --> 03:50:02.720]  it's just completely wrong no matter how hard you try and push this it's not going to work it's not
[03:50:02.720 --> 03:50:08.800]  going to work absolutely incredible let's tell you again about info wars store.com before we get

[03:50:52.480 --> 03:50:57.600]  actually created a buzzfeed special at the time we should probably create a brain force special
[03:50:57.600 --> 03:51:01.680]  that sometime in the near future given the amount of triggering that's gone on with the
[03:51:01.680 --> 03:51:07.840]  mainstream media as regards to brain force brain force plus over the past couple of weeks so you

[03:51:21.360 --> 03:51:30.000]  get back into something that i was talking about in a video called the new sexual puritans now of
[03:51:30.000 --> 03:51:36.400]  course we've had a massive fallout from this sex abuse scandal now if you go up on drudgerport.com
[03:51:36.400 --> 03:51:42.720]  they've got a story about ariana hoffington turned a blind eye to sexual abuse sexual assault at
[03:51:42.720 --> 03:51:48.400]  the hoffington post this is really affecting predominantly the left of course it first emerged
[03:51:48.400 --> 03:51:54.800]  out of hollywood with the harvey weinstein revelations now it's infecting politics over in
[03:51:55.360 --> 03:52:02.000]  the uk we had the pest minster scandal so-called because there was a lot of revelations about
[03:52:02.000 --> 03:52:08.640]  sex abuse being uncovered in west minster of course now it's affecting newsrooms across america
[03:52:09.200 --> 03:52:13.760]  predominantly left wing now of course you had sex abuse scandals on the right you've got the
[03:52:13.760 --> 03:52:20.400]  judge roymor situation now he denies the allegations it's predominantly though affects the left
[03:52:20.400 --> 03:52:24.800]  which of course is highly ironic because they're the ones who constantly virtue signal about our
[03:52:24.800 --> 03:52:31.360]  misogynistic about how sexist the right is and yet what do we see a lot of the most prominent
[03:52:31.920 --> 03:52:38.160]  vehement male feminists have since been exposed as sexual abusers of women because we had the
[03:52:38.160 --> 03:52:44.160]  hilarious case of sam christ who was a very prominent hater of mine he was a vice writer i
[03:52:44.160 --> 03:52:50.000]  think he also wrote for the guardian he was a male feminist he was one of my most vehement haters
[03:52:50.000 --> 03:52:56.160]  he was a far left marxist constantly virtue signaling about how we were all misogynistic
[03:52:56.160 --> 03:53:01.760]  bigots of course you know what happened to sam christ right well the woman who he sexually assaulted
[03:53:01.760 --> 03:53:08.640]  went public and basically laid bare how he was trying to get her to have sex with him she wasn't
[03:53:08.640 --> 03:53:14.240]  interested he put his hands on her he sexually assaulted her he also bragged about by the way
[03:53:14.240 --> 03:53:20.560]  this is a marxist remember this is a marxist he bragged about how he could take her back
[03:53:20.560 --> 03:53:26.720]  to quote his parents massive house or his massive house he said i can take you back to my massive
[03:53:26.720 --> 03:53:31.760]  house the girl said well it's not your house is it it's your parents house and he said well yeah
[03:53:31.760 --> 03:53:40.080]  but i'm going to inherit it this is a marxist he's talking about the economic system in that way
[03:53:40.080 --> 03:53:45.520]  and he's sexually assaulting women and he admitted to it he's since disappeared from twitter
[03:53:46.960 --> 03:53:51.280]  and the irony is delectable because he was the one he was one of the prominent people who was
[03:53:51.280 --> 03:53:56.560]  lecturing everybody else about how they need to be an ally of women a male feminist he turns
[03:53:56.560 --> 03:54:04.400]  out to be an actual sexual abuser because he also had rupert mayers he also had to apologize for
[03:54:04.400 --> 03:54:11.520]  grabbing for groping women he was a vehement male feminist so again the fallout seems to affect
[03:54:11.520 --> 03:54:17.680]  predominantly a lot on the left but as i explained in this video the new sexual puritans which is
[03:54:17.680 --> 03:54:24.880]  upon my youtube channel it's now kind of crossed over it's transgressed into something more which is
[03:54:24.880 --> 03:54:31.760]  is third wave feminism having been completely debunked and discredited now hijacking this scandal
[03:54:31.760 --> 03:54:38.080]  as it crosses across the board from the entertainment industry to politics to newsrooms
[03:54:38.080 --> 03:54:45.360]  they're hijacking the scandal to demonize and to demean all men now i give evidence of this
[03:54:45.360 --> 03:54:50.240]  in the article a new video sorry of course we had lindy west being given a platform last week
[03:54:50.240 --> 03:54:56.240]  another top feminist lindy west given a platform by the new york times to basically make the
[03:54:56.240 --> 03:55:01.920]  argument that this proves that feminist third wave screeching harpy feminists were right all
[03:55:01.920 --> 03:55:08.080]  along that all men are evil that it was right to hate men that miss andry is perfectly okay
[03:55:08.080 --> 03:55:14.480]  because look look what happened look at all these men abusing women so again they institute this
[03:55:14.480 --> 03:55:21.440]  collectivist narrative where all men an entire gender are to blame for the actions of a relative
[03:55:21.440 --> 03:55:28.480]  few if you compare the few who've been exposed to the actual male population in the west conflate
[03:55:28.480 --> 03:55:34.720]  that and use it to demonize all men to say look we were right all along and what did lindy west do
[03:55:35.760 --> 03:55:40.240]  what did these other top feminists do in the aftermath of the harpy winds theme scandal
[03:55:40.240 --> 03:55:46.480]  well they wrote articles they wrote blogs and had videos saying basically men need to ascribe
[03:55:46.480 --> 03:55:52.080]  to all these different behaviors in fact there was one medium article which listed 20 behaviors
[03:55:53.040 --> 03:55:59.840]  that men needed to take that needed to change and adopt in order to not be an evil sex sexist
[03:55:59.840 --> 03:56:04.960]  misogynistic abuser of women so they basically came out and said look you're all guilty you had
[03:56:04.960 --> 03:56:10.960]  am and what was his name matt moghory the actor on cnn come out and say we're all complicit all men
[03:56:10.960 --> 03:56:17.200]  are complicit in this we're all guilty oh and by the way the only way for you to atone for it
[03:56:17.200 --> 03:56:25.280]  is to adopt all our demented far-left political beliefs well isn't that a coincidence the only
[03:56:25.280 --> 03:56:32.240]  way we can prove we're not evil sexual abusers is by adopting all your political beliefs oh but this
[03:56:32.240 --> 03:56:39.280]  is about protecting women isn't it no it's not it's about power it always comes back to power
[03:56:39.280 --> 03:56:44.560]  so in one case in this medium article this top feminist and it's in the video you can
[03:56:44.560 --> 03:56:50.320]  read the examples she basically goes through it and said right now you need to support abortion
[03:56:50.320 --> 03:56:54.480]  you need to support black lives matter there was all kind of weird stuff in there like you need to
[03:56:54.480 --> 03:57:00.320]  only watch ethical porn whatever that is a bunch of other stuff she said you can't use the term
[03:57:00.320 --> 03:57:06.400]  social justice warrior anymore that's sexist you can't use the term feminazi anymore basically an
[03:57:06.400 --> 03:57:13.280]  entire list of language policing of thought policing of behavior control and if you don't
[03:57:13.280 --> 03:57:20.160]  adopt all of this you're an evil sexist misogynistic abuser of women that's what they're doing with
[03:57:20.160 --> 03:57:26.320]  the fallout from this sexual abuse scandal they're conflating it hijacking it using it for their own
