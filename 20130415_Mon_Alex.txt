[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:31.000]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:31.000 --> 00:38.000]  Well, all Hades is breaking loose in world markets, including gold. The globalists are
[00:38.000 --> 00:43.000]  on record saying that they've been artificially suppressing the price of precious metals because
[00:43.000 --> 00:50.000]  it competes with their fiat currencies, which they're devaluing. But in the laws of finance
[00:50.000 --> 00:55.000]  and the laws of economics, gold and silver and other commodities will only go up over
[00:55.000 --> 01:01.000]  time. The insiders, of course, control the major stock markets and can go up and down
[01:01.000 --> 01:08.000]  and ride the rallies up and then, of course, trigger the declines downward. And that's
[01:08.000 --> 01:14.000]  all part of the record, from LIBOR and the fixing of interest rates to the plunge protection
[01:14.000 --> 01:15.000]  team.
[01:15.000 --> 01:21.000]  But I have expected that they could massively drive down gold. But if you look at a 12,
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.000]  13-year graph, it will only go back up later. That's why I'm not going to sell any of the
[01:26.000 --> 01:31.000]  silver I have. And again, I don't have gold and silver. The gold and silver I have as
[01:31.000 --> 01:35.000]  an investment, as something to try to make a bunch of money, even though most of the
[01:35.000 --> 01:43.000]  gold I bought was when it was below 500, silver when it was below $10. I've taken the capital,
[01:43.000 --> 01:47.000]  extra capital that's been brought in really since and put it into the news operations.
[01:47.000 --> 01:51.000]  But I do have an emergency backup nest egg, a little bit of cash, a little bit of gold
[01:51.000 --> 02:00.000]  for a little bit of property. But personally, if they drove gold down to $1,000 an ounce
[02:00.000 --> 02:03.000]  or if they drove gold down to $600 an ounce, I'm not going to sell it.
[02:03.000 --> 02:09.000]  Because that just shows what a totally manipulated society we're in, where they use a naked shorting
[02:09.000 --> 02:14.000]  to do this. And we're going to get Gerald Cilente, Max Keiser to pop in today or tomorrow
[02:14.000 --> 02:19.000]  with their take on what's happening with this. And we will continue to track it.
[02:19.000 --> 02:24.000]  Go to drudgereport.com. We can punch this up on screen for people who are watching on
[02:24.000 --> 02:34.000]  prisonplanet.tv. They've got a live feed of what's going on there. The Bloomberg gold
[02:34.000 --> 02:45.000]  is down 6.91%. 6.91% to $1,380 an ounce. They're calling this a collapse. A collapse would
[02:45.000 --> 02:51.000]  be losing half its value is generally what you call a collapse, not 6.91.
[02:51.000 --> 02:56.000]  But they're trying to create a collapse. Here's the headlines. Gold set for worst two day
[02:56.000 --> 03:04.000]  loss since 1983. I've got other headlines here where they're calling it a collapse.
[03:04.000 --> 03:09.000]  So that's the type of stuff that's going on. Investors bail amid collapse. There's the
[03:09.000 --> 03:14.000]  headline. Panic is everywhere. Worst two day loss since 1983. So that's how the media
[03:14.000 --> 03:22.000]  is pushing it. ABC News. Gold investors exit amid price collapse. Meanwhile, you'll see
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.000]  Soros bad mouth gold. You'll see other globalists do it. They just want to be able to drive
[03:26.000 --> 03:33.000]  it down to buy it. And they're forcing Cyprus to sell off its gold because Cyprus was signed
[03:33.000 --> 03:40.000]  on to prop up European bonds. And the EU is in the news today saying, we're doing great.
[03:40.000 --> 03:45.000]  Everything is going according to plan. Europe's great. And they mean the globalists that are
[03:45.000 --> 03:50.000]  capturing Europe, destroying its middle class. You see, Europe must be impoverished. The
[03:50.000 --> 03:56.000]  United States must be impoverished. Canada must be impoverished. The Western world from
[03:56.000 --> 04:03.000]  New Zealand to Canada, from the United States to Deutschland, from France to even Turkey's
[04:03.000 --> 04:09.000]  part of the West, really. They must all be impoverished. Eastern Europe, you name it,
[04:09.000 --> 04:15.000]  must be totally impoverished. That's the globalist philosophy. The globalists want America out
[04:15.000 --> 04:21.000]  of the way. Fighting with each other along racial and religious lines, balkanized with
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.000]  a robber baron elite above the law who pay no taxes. And their minions pay less than
[04:27.000 --> 04:33.000]  a blue collar worker. Obama pays 18.4% taxes. That was in the Wall Street Journal yesterday.
[04:33.000 --> 04:37.000]  And by the way, it's the day you pay your money to the private Federal Reserve. Didn't
[04:37.000 --> 04:43.000]  have a Federal Reserve till 1913. Didn't have an income tax. How do we build America without
[04:43.000 --> 04:48.000]  it? They use the income tax as like tying the boat to the dock. So no matter how fast
[04:48.000 --> 04:53.000]  you rev the engine and the propeller, you never leave the dock. It's all coming up,
[04:53.000 --> 04:58.000]  plus the massive attacks on the Second Amendment and more. I'm Alex Jones.
[05:00.000 --> 05:05.000]  I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating. I was lifting weights
[05:05.000 --> 05:10.000]  and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving for minerals and trace
[05:10.000 --> 05:15.000]  elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half
[05:15.000 --> 05:20.000]  of what I was eating previously and be satisfied. Now, there are hundreds of great products
[05:20.000 --> 05:27.000]  at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds

[08:26.000 --> 08:40.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, the 15th day of April, 2013. I am your host, Alex Jones,
[08:40.000 --> 08:48.000]  and we're gonna be here, Lord willing, for the next three hours today. And we're gonna
[08:48.000 --> 08:50.000]  have pop in at the bottom of the next hour.
[08:50.000 --> 08:55.000]  Richard Belzer has got a new book out on the Kennedy assassination hit list that has the
[08:55.000 --> 08:59.000]  compelling evidence that it was an inside job with more people involved than Lee Harvey
[08:59.000 --> 09:04.000]  Oswald, obviously, because of the hundreds of people that were murdered to cover it up.
[09:04.000 --> 09:12.000]  The witnesses, you name it, the 50th anniversary coming up, we're gonna be talking about some
[09:12.000 --> 09:18.000]  of that today. Obviously, the globalists on record are manipulating interest rates, they're
[09:18.000 --> 09:28.000]  manipulating gold prices, they just use paper, fiat to drive down the prices. There is a
[09:28.000 --> 09:36.000]  lot going on today that we are going to be breaking down. We've got developments on the
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.000]  North Korean front, North Korea brands US an enemy of the state.
[09:40.000 --> 09:46.000]  Yeah, our governments demonize the founding fathers and the patriots, Christians, you
[09:46.000 --> 09:50.000]  know, as enemies of the state, so why not? In fact, North Korea should love the US government.
[09:50.000 --> 09:56.000]  I mean, it acts more and more just like they do. And the North Korean government is saying
[09:56.000 --> 10:02.000]  they're ready to launch missiles. South Korean defense minister concurs that that is going
[10:02.000 --> 10:15.000]  on just all part of another terrorist government menacing everyone so that they can get more
[10:15.000 --> 10:18.000]  oil, more food, more weapons.
[10:18.000 --> 10:22.000]  That's what our government does. It's like give us all your rights, give us all your
[10:22.000 --> 10:26.000]  liberties. Let us spy on you without warrants, let us secretly arrest you, or Al Qaeda will
[10:26.000 --> 10:32.000]  come and murder you and your family and blow you up. North Korea says give us money, give
[10:32.000 --> 10:40.000]  us oil, give us all this power, or we will launch nuclear missiles at you.
[10:40.000 --> 10:46.000]  And why produce anything? Why not just take over society and menace everyone when you're
[10:46.000 --> 10:54.000]  the only ones that have the guns? But before this dream of the total state can take place,
[10:54.000 --> 11:00.000]  they need to first disarm the American people. It doesn't look good in the New World Order
[11:00.000 --> 11:06.000]  for the main engine of the empire, the military engine and propaganda engine of the transhumanist
[11:06.000 --> 11:12.000]  eugenicist death cult based control freak religion of world government.
[11:12.000 --> 11:17.000]  If the United States can still have families living in homes together, if the United States
[11:17.000 --> 11:30.000]  still has a high standard of living, if the United States is still armed, the power structure
[11:30.000 --> 11:37.000]  cannot and will not put up with that. And that's why there is the move to disarm the
[11:37.000 --> 11:42.000]  American people. I mean, it's very simple and they're putting their full court press
[11:42.000 --> 11:50.000]  in just everywhere. Every one of their operatives from Bob Costas to Bill Maher are there saying
[11:50.000 --> 11:55.000]  just get rid of the Second Amendment, get rid of it completely.
[11:55.000 --> 12:01.000]  In fact, this was Bill Maher Friday night on his HBO program, expletive-laden, just
[12:01.000 --> 12:06.000]  saying, hey, let's just get rid of the citizens right. You never had a right, he goes on to
[12:06.000 --> 12:12.000]  say, the full video's up on infowars.com. The Second Amendment is BS, he says. Let's
[12:12.000 --> 12:13.000]  play that clip.
[12:13.000 --> 12:17.000]  I'm sorry, but this is the problem with the gun debate is that it's a constant center
[12:17.000 --> 12:22.000]  right debate. There's no left in this debate. Everyone on the left is so afraid to say what
[12:22.000 --> 12:28.000]  should be said, which is the Second Amendment is BS. Why doesn't anyone go at the core of
[12:28.000 --> 12:29.000]  it?
[12:29.000 --> 12:33.000]  And then they go on, you can watch the full video to say there is no individual right.
[12:33.000 --> 12:39.000]  Well, then how can the government have guns if the government is by the consent of the
[12:39.000 --> 12:49.000]  governed? I mean, our country fought a war. Our country began out of the attempt to take
[12:49.000 --> 12:56.000]  guns. And the examples of this just go on and on and on.
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.000]  And it makes me sick to know we're going into bondage. You notice they're taking all the
[13:00.000 --> 13:04.000]  other rights and liberties right now. You notice right now they're trying to say we
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.000]  don't have any rights. We don't have any, quote, privileges. Well, the Bill of Rights,
[13:08.000 --> 13:11.000]  the Constitution and Declaration of Independence are not a list of privileges.
[13:11.000 --> 13:16.000]  They're a list of rights that exist of all free human beings. You don't need to hear
[13:16.000 --> 13:21.000]  a law that says it's wrong to grab somebody's child out of the backyard and molest them.
[13:21.000 --> 13:26.000]  Because you have a conscience and you're not inherently an evil person. You don't want
[13:26.000 --> 13:33.000]  to do that. In fact, if you hear about it in the news, you're horrified by it. Couples
[13:33.000 --> 13:40.000]  been charged with the baby was crying, so they reportedly smothered it with a pillow.
[13:40.000 --> 13:47.000]  You don't need to be told that's horrible to know that it's wrong. You don't need to
[13:47.000 --> 13:52.000]  be told abortions wrong. You know inherently, especially when it's nine months old and the
[13:52.000 --> 13:57.000]  baby slips out. So they chop it up there on the table while it begs for its life and literally
[13:57.000 --> 14:03.000]  fights the scalpel. That's coming out in these different court hearings about abortionist
[14:03.000 --> 14:07.000]  where it's they're just filthy facilities where they make jokes with the dead babies,
[14:07.000 --> 14:12.000]  you know, selling the body parts. A lot of them are do weird rituals. Of course, who
[14:12.000 --> 14:17.000]  do you think wants to be an abortionist? A large portion of them are into black magic.
[14:17.000 --> 14:22.000]  It just keeps coming out. Of course, they're into black magic. People that do partial birth
[14:22.000 --> 14:26.000]  abortions. I mean, you could have somebody who thinks it's really a right. No, it's not
[14:26.000 --> 14:30.000]  really a human. And, you know, they do first trimester abortions and you could have some
[14:30.000 --> 14:35.000]  argument there in their minds, at least I don't agree with it, that, hey, you know,
[14:35.000 --> 14:40.000]  this isn't really a human yet. But see now it's hey, let's kill people up to three years
[14:40.000 --> 14:44.000]  of age. Hey, let's go ahead and shoot grandma in the head.
[14:44.000 --> 14:50.000]  You know, let's go ahead and no, no, that'd be too nice. Let's dehydrate grandma. Let's
[14:50.000 --> 14:58.000]  dehydrate. Grandma, that's the that's the best way to get rid of her. And that just
[14:58.000 --> 15:03.000]  goes on everywhere. So the point is when we stop caring about each other, when we stop
[15:03.000 --> 15:10.000]  caring about checks and balances and liberties, there's no foundation, there's no floor. Everything
[15:10.000 --> 15:16.000]  falls to the absolute core of tyranny.
[15:16.000 --> 15:24.000]  So the worst of the worst then set the standard. And that's what the establishment historically
[15:24.000 --> 15:30.000]  has known, at least in the West in the last 400 years, and realized that more liberty,
[15:30.000 --> 15:35.000]  more checks and balances means more chances for them to have a future and not have a new
[15:35.000 --> 15:41.000]  government come to power that actually robs them. These tyrannies are very dangerous for
[15:41.000 --> 15:48.000]  the establishment itself, but they're such an anti family, such an evil possessed lust
[15:48.000 --> 15:54.000]  for death and destruction and to really tear down the foundations of manhood and womanhood
[15:54.000 --> 16:02.000]  and childhood. They're such an evil animating this. This is not some government true believer
[16:02.000 --> 16:09.000]  socialist utopia they're building. They're building a hellish world.
[16:09.000 --> 16:15.000]  And you can look at the fruits of collectivism and fascism as a collectivist system, socialism
[16:15.000 --> 16:20.000]  that leads to communism as they try to dress them up like fake choices in the colleges.
[16:20.000 --> 16:29.000]  That's not the real political paradigm. Before 150 years ago, it was taught that the left
[16:29.000 --> 16:37.000]  and right were male, female. Sinister was the left associated with Eve, the devil, okay?
[16:37.000 --> 16:42.000]  That's the only left and right that there is. And so the Illuminati in France began
[16:42.000 --> 16:48.000]  to promote 200 years ago, roughly about 215 years ago, this is all mainline history books,
[16:48.000 --> 17:01.000]  the left right paradigm for politics out of their ancient religion, which is just magic
[17:01.000 --> 17:03.000]  or the occult, the hidden.
[17:03.000 --> 17:10.000]  Before that, the debate was less liberty or more liberty, more freedom or less freedom.
[17:10.000 --> 17:18.000]  Is this a tyrant or is this not a tyrant? Is it just? Is there justice, justice for
[17:18.000 --> 17:28.000]  all? Because you had a sense of justice because you were an upright, moral, noble person.
[17:28.000 --> 17:36.000]  Nobility didn't just mean that you came from a royal family or a top family. It meant that
[17:36.000 --> 17:40.000]  you were noble in your bearing, that you led your troops. If you're gonna launch a war
[17:40.000 --> 17:45.000]  as a king, you better be in the very front line with everybody trying to kill you.
[17:45.000 --> 17:51.000]  George Washington at the head of his troops, his clothing shot up on a routine basis protected
[17:51.000 --> 18:00.000]  by Providence, that is nobility. Nobility is being able to turn the other cheek when
[18:00.000 --> 18:06.000]  someone is weak and pathetic and in a bad position to teach them a lesson, but also
[18:06.000 --> 18:11.000]  knowing when to shut somebody down and crush them when they're a snake and consciously
[18:11.000 --> 18:18.000]  evil. Christ was the ultimate example of nobility. Turn the other cheek to the brethren, but
[18:18.000 --> 18:22.000]  whip the money changers because they were consciously turned over to evil and fraud
[18:22.000 --> 18:27.000]  and defrauding the entire system and had taken over the house of the Lord, had taken over
[18:27.000 --> 18:33.000]  God's house, had defiled it, had set themselves up before God as the idol.
[18:33.000 --> 18:39.000]  How many churches have done that? How many churches have turned the state and the worship
[18:39.000 --> 18:47.000]  of the state and the worship of immature, degenerate, arbitrary power? Let's go to another
[18:47.000 --> 18:51.000]  clip. Again, here's Dianne Feinstein. If she can get the votes, Mr. And Mrs. America, turn
[18:51.000 --> 18:54.000]  in all your semi-autos. Here it is.
[18:54.000 --> 19:02.000]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban,
[19:02.000 --> 19:08.000]  picking up every one of them, Mr. And Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done
[19:08.000 --> 19:09.000]  it.
[19:09.000 --> 19:14.000]  She would have done it. So Bill Maher says, hey, you have no Second Amendment, you have
[19:14.000 --> 19:19.000]  no right. Bob Costas gets all excited and starts clapping and agreeing. And these guys
[19:19.000 --> 19:25.000]  are crazed on these shows. They know their willing accomplices for an authoritarian takeover.
[19:25.000 --> 19:30.000]  They've been told that they're gonna be absolutely taken care of while they sit there in their
[19:30.000 --> 19:35.000]  big armored communities with armed bodyguards. They'll be able to keep their guns. And that
[19:35.000 --> 19:40.000]  they've been told, go along with this, you'll be taken care of, while the globalists consciously
[19:40.000 --> 19:45.000]  implode the economy to make us poor as a political tool of control.
[19:45.000 --> 19:51.000]  Now, there's new gun news coming up. And I talked about this Friday, I talked about it
[19:51.000 --> 19:56.000]  yesterday, it's so important. The video is up at drugsreport.com on the left-hand side
[19:56.000 --> 20:00.000]  next to the California flag.
[20:00.000 --> 20:05.000]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins. That bears repeating.
[20:05.000 --> 20:11.000]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins. And ProEM-1, daily
[20:11.000 --> 20:17.000]  probiotic cleanse is the key to digestive health. ProEM-1 is a powerful liquid probiotic,
[20:17.000 --> 20:22.000]  strong enough to cleanse, gentle enough to use every day. ProEM-1 is dairy, wheat, and
[20:22.000 --> 20:26.000]  soy-free, contains all natural and certified organic ingredients, contains no preservatives
[20:26.000 --> 20:31.000]  or animal products, supports a healthy digestive and immune system, supports weight loss, improves
[20:31.000 --> 20:36.000]  absorption of food nutrients, aids in controlling yeast infections, is never freeze dried, and
[20:36.000 --> 20:41.000]  removes groups of live viable beneficial microbes to cleanse and remove toxins. Order ProEM-1,
[20:41.000 --> 20:49.000]  daily probiotic cleanse at teraganix.com, spelled T-E-R-A-G-A-N-I-X.com, teraganix.com,
[20:49.000 --> 21:04.000]  or call toll free, 866-369-3678. That's 866-369-3678. ProEM-1, the raw probiotic.
[21:04.000 --> 21:09.000]  Curious about what comes next? Next is the feeling of vulnerability you get after you
[21:09.000 --> 21:14.000]  arrive home to discover your house has been ransacked by burglars. Fool the bad guys with
[21:14.000 --> 21:21.000]  a new improved fake TV. You asked for it, we listened, and we made our new fake TV three
[21:21.000 --> 21:25.000]  times brighter than our previous model. The brightness of our new fake TV is equivalent
[21:25.000 --> 21:31.000]  to a 40 inch TV. It simulates the color and motion of a real TV while you're away from
[21:31.000 --> 21:36.000]  home. And when burglars think someone is home watching television, they're likely to pass
[21:36.000 --> 21:42.000]  your house and move on to an easier target. The new, brighter fake TV is only $39.95 and
[21:42.000 --> 21:53.000]  includes free shipping. Go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5FAKETV. That's 877-532-5388. Or
[21:53.000 --> 22:01.000]  go to faketv.com. Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.

[23:24.000 --> 23:33.000]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[23:33.000 --> 23:37.000]  counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lead back at interest, forcing taxes
[23:37.000 --> 23:41.000]  to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[23:41.000 --> 23:45.000]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing
[23:45.000 --> 23:48.000]  army? Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our
[23:48.000 --> 23:54.000]  monetary system. Call for your copy. 800-686-2237. It's time to understand the system. Call
[23:54.000 --> 24:06.000]  800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.
[24:06.000 --> 24:12.000]  He aligns himself with the truth. And it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening
[24:12.000 --> 24:26.000]  to Alex Jones. I'll be honest with you. I've analyzed the feeling I have. The overdriving
[24:26.000 --> 24:38.000]  feeling is sorrow. That America and the world is so decadent, so fallen, so childlike, so
[24:38.000 --> 24:46.000]  insecure, so immature. I people watch and I watch their actions at a movie or or at
[24:46.000 --> 24:56.000]  the park or at the shopping mall or paying bills. And I sit there. And I see the general
[24:56.000 --> 25:04.000]  public just absolutely dumbed down and immature, and they have no idea what they're facing.
[25:04.000 --> 25:11.000]  And then those of us that are aware and awake and involved. We're the group being demonized.
[25:11.000 --> 25:16.000]  I mean, look at Homeland Security demonizes people that talk about a new world order,
[25:16.000 --> 25:22.000]  people that talk about a new world order, global governance program, returning veterans,
[25:22.000 --> 25:30.000]  mainline Christians now. Next to the Ku Klux Klan and Al Qaeda, the army's being taught
[25:30.000 --> 25:34.000]  it. I talked about this yesterday and showed the news articles. I'm gonna do a special
[25:34.000 --> 25:39.000]  report this week where even the state police of Colorado have gone public going and sheriffs
[25:39.000 --> 25:40.000]  have gone public going.
[25:40.000 --> 25:47.000]  The new federal training ask if we're ready to confiscate guns from Christians. I mean,
[25:47.000 --> 25:56.000]  they're training for war with us. I mean, it's happening and it's all over the top.
[25:56.000 --> 26:00.000]  And now I don't even have the instinct to believe the United States. I mean, I realize
[26:00.000 --> 26:04.000]  it's a worldwide tyranny. A lot of people hear this and get scared and decide to just
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.000]  say nothing. Maybe they'll pass you over. The Angel of Death is not gonna pass over
[26:08.000 --> 26:13.000]  your house, ladies and gentlemen, until you publicly say where you stand and publicly
[26:13.000 --> 26:16.000]  say you stand against the enemy.
[26:16.000 --> 26:21.000]  Going along with this is not going to have the evil pass over you. It's gonna have it
[26:21.000 --> 26:26.000]  come to your doorstep. And I just cannot impress upon you. I'll tell you what else makes me
[26:26.000 --> 26:31.000]  sick. All the infighting by so-called libertarian and conservative talk show host who then attack
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  people and then people even respond back.
[26:33.000 --> 26:38.000]  You know what? I'm even wrong to have responded back. And I say this and then he does new
[26:38.000 --> 26:43.000]  stuff and I get mad at him. But things are too serious. And I usually can do what I say
[26:43.000 --> 26:47.000]  I'm gonna do. Like I've said before, I'm not gonna respond back to Glenn Beck.
[26:47.000 --> 26:52.000]  I may respond if he does stuff again, but I'm gonna be gentlemanly about it. And I am
[26:52.000 --> 26:57.000]  putting out all the branches to all my so-called enemies, even though a lot of them I know
[26:57.000 --> 27:04.000]  are evil people who wouldn't take an olive branch. I'm still spiritually forgiving everyone
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  because a lot of people get jealous when you're in this position.
[27:06.000 --> 27:11.000]  A lot of people act weird. You can always one up yourself by putting down somebody.
[27:11.000 --> 27:16.000]  It's all Cass Sunstein, cognitive infiltration. The White House said four years ago they would
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.000]  infiltrate alternative media, try to get us to end fight with each other. Ladies and gentlemen,
[27:20.000 --> 27:26.000]  we need to unify together defending the Second Amendment, defending the sanctity of life,
[27:26.000 --> 27:27.000]  going in.
[27:27.000 --> 27:34.000]  By the way, we're on the march reversing abortion. Because polls show, the large index of polls,
[27:34.000 --> 27:42.000]  people swung against abortion. The people have swung against GMO. They have swung against,
[27:42.000 --> 27:47.000]  so it's not about left right now. It's about right and wrong. People are swinging pro-gun.
[27:47.000 --> 27:53.000]  All the numbers show. That's why the collectivist who were in control gutting our economy, gutting
[27:53.000 --> 27:59.000]  our future, shining us on to trillions of dollars of debt that aren't ours, selling
[27:59.000 --> 28:03.000]  our infrastructure out for nothing to China, giving them all our deepwater ports in this
[28:03.000 --> 28:06.000]  hemisphere, as part of a globalist deal.
[28:06.000 --> 28:11.000]  Just like Hitler and Stalin divided Poland, America has been divided between the EU mega
[28:11.000 --> 28:17.000]  banks, the British banks, the Federal Reserve banks that are globalist owned, foreign, and
[28:17.000 --> 28:22.000]  China. It's already happened. The deal was already made. That's why they gave them Panama
[28:22.000 --> 28:28.000]  Canal in 2000. That's why they've given them all the deepwater ports on the West Coast,
[28:28.000 --> 28:30.000]  from Seattle to Long Beach.
[28:30.000 --> 28:38.000]  And when you've studied history, I don't just say I get chills, folks. I can hardly do this
[28:38.000 --> 28:44.000]  radio show. Because even doing this radio show is just like everything's business as
[28:44.000 --> 28:54.000]  usual. It's not business as usual. I just am so worried about my children. I watched
[28:54.000 --> 28:59.000]  my five-year-old daughter go off to dance class this morning with my mother, who took
[28:59.000 --> 29:00.000]  her.
[29:00.000 --> 29:04.000]  And my mother's innocent, even though she's a very smart person who knows history, is
[29:04.000 --> 29:11.000]  a history-obsessed buff. Still, what is my mother supposed to do to fight the New World
[29:11.000 --> 29:17.000]  Order? What's my five-year-old daughter supposed to do? I'm the man. I'm supposed to do something
[29:17.000 --> 29:24.000]  about this, and I don't know what to do, because you got crazy criminals running wild.
[29:24.000 --> 29:30.000]  You can go out in Austin, Texas, or San Diego, California, and every person you talk to in
[29:30.000 --> 29:35.000]  the areas says, put all gun owners in forced labor camps. Ban water. I mean, they're just
[29:35.000 --> 29:42.000]  a sick cult of sick freaks who are not connected to history or reality and have no idea what
[29:42.000 --> 29:49.000]  they're going to do to everybody. Okay? I mean, oh, man. We'll be back. Stay with us.
[29:49.000 --> 30:02.000]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:02.000 --> 30:09.000]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal

[31:04.000 --> 31:08.000]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your
[31:08.000 --> 31:13.000]  arsenal for home protection. When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for
[31:13.000 --> 31:18.000]  intruders? Check out SimpliSafe. It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is

[32:00.000 --> 32:05.000]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011,
[32:05.000 --> 32:11.000]  storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012,
[32:11.000 --> 32:15.000]  we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of
[32:15.000 --> 32:19.000]  sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is, you are.
[32:19.000 --> 32:24.000]  We all are. Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control
[32:24.000 --> 32:29.000]  Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability
[32:29.000 --> 32:34.000]  of your food supply with eFoodsDirect. Be prepared before you need it with nutrient-dense
[32:34.000 --> 32:38.000]  food you can store for up to 25 years. You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed

[32:49.000 --> 32:55.000]  Alex and check out their spring specials. Again, that number is 800-409-5633 or on the
[32:55.000 --> 33:02.000]  web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex. You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[33:25.000 --> 33:32.000]  That number is 800-409-5633.
[33:55.000 --> 34:00.500]  But still, they're in control of our currencies worldwide. They're mopping up the few countries
[34:00.500 --> 34:11.500]  they don't control, and they are butchering the value of the people's pensions, the people's
[34:11.500 --> 34:16.280]  investments, the infrastructure, because it's not enough to control the fiat issuance of
[34:16.280 --> 34:22.540]  currency and credit. The technocrats want to make you poor to control you, and that's
[34:22.540 --> 34:27.280]  really their greatest crime. And then they argue, well, people having plenty of food
[34:27.280 --> 34:32.160]  and water and entertainment and shelter, that makes them decadent. And so we're gonna take
[34:32.160 --> 34:33.160]  that away.
[34:33.160 --> 34:40.120]  You know, austerity is beautiful. And of course, there's a grain of truth there, that prosperity
[34:40.120 --> 34:46.200]  makes monsters. Adversity makes men. I flipped what Victor Hugo said, or out of order. He
[34:46.200 --> 34:53.440]  said, adversity makes men, prosperity makes monsters. But the globalists have geared the
[34:53.440 --> 34:58.760]  educational system to dumb people down on record. That's declassified, covered in the
[34:58.760 --> 35:02.560]  book Deliberate Dumbing Down with the internal documents. Charlotte is a re-head of policy
[35:02.560 --> 35:04.440]  department of education.
[35:04.440 --> 35:10.920]  It's on record they wanna dumb down self-centered, really evil population. I mean, I don't really
[35:10.920 --> 35:16.200]  pay attention to pop culture, but I've been forced to. And the stuff targeting tweenie
[35:16.200 --> 35:22.720]  and preteen girls, 8, 9, 10, 11 year olds, that I hear booming out of cars and then I
[35:22.720 --> 35:29.360]  see children listening to on their iPads and iPods.
[35:29.360 --> 35:38.880]  All of it is sexualizing them and hardcore devil worship. And I'm not just talking about
[35:38.880 --> 35:47.800]  Lady Gaga, but Kesha, Jay-Z, all of it. And again, the guys were showing me this weekend,
[35:47.800 --> 35:53.780]  some of the Kesha videos, where they're teaching young girls how to commit suicide and how
[35:53.780 --> 35:58.160]  beautiful it is to be married to the devil and how great it is to kill yourself.
[35:58.160 --> 36:02.920]  And we wonder why kids are killing themselves and little girls are epidemic cutting themselves
[36:02.920 --> 36:07.520]  and it shows that. In fact, I don't even wanna look at it, take it down off the screen. And
[36:07.520 --> 36:13.240]  of course, I can't imagine how cursed Kesha will be. Not by God, I mean, when you get
[36:13.240 --> 36:15.880]  into evil, it will destroy you.
[36:15.880 --> 36:24.320]  I shiver just watching this. Folks, when societies do this, there's always giant wars, everything
[36:24.320 --> 36:32.100]  collapses and large portions of the population are killed. I mean, this is like clockwork.
[36:32.100 --> 36:46.040]  This is like the oven dinging when it's gotten up to temperature. This is, I know I'm just
[36:46.040 --> 36:50.180]  ranting and preaching here, I've got so much news to get to.
[36:50.180 --> 37:00.320]  When we can go out on the streets of Austin and every person we talk to, every person
[37:00.320 --> 37:04.680]  we say, hey, let's ban dihydrogen monoxide to save the earth and they just mindlessly
[37:04.680 --> 37:16.520]  sign it when that's H2O. And then people on infoawars.com, the so-called liberals, the
[37:16.520 --> 37:22.180]  authoritarian brainwashed government cult people, the state cult, they're in there arguing
[37:22.180 --> 37:26.480]  dihydrogen monoxide is not water with straight faces and they're doing it on YouTube.
[37:26.480 --> 37:33.480]  Because see, in the new world, you don't argue with our facts, you just make your own facts.
[37:33.480 --> 37:38.520]  Like O'Brien tells Winston when he's torturing him in 1984, he goes, Winston, two plus two
[37:38.520 --> 37:44.440]  equals four, you say that's proof of freedom? I'm gonna torture you until you'll believe
[37:44.440 --> 37:46.720]  it's whatever I say it is.
[37:46.720 --> 37:51.720]  Don't you know we could suspend gravity with our mathematicians, but also still have gravity
[37:51.720 --> 37:58.720]  for our ships and aircraft to navigate? And have our captains and pilots believe that
[37:58.720 --> 38:06.000]  there's no gravity while they use gravity in their computations? And that's exactly
[38:06.000 --> 38:11.920]  it. They are now arguing dihydrogen monoxide is not water instead of admitting that all
[38:11.920 --> 38:22.960]  these university trendies and physics graduates and chemist graduates don't know what dihydrogen
[38:22.960 --> 38:24.880]  monoxide is.
[38:24.880 --> 38:33.200]  I mean, we've reached that level now where you can go, cuz I talked to Mark Dice. I mean,
[38:33.200 --> 38:38.880]  he went out and talked to people and that's what he ran into. The video's up on drugsreport.com
[38:38.880 --> 38:44.680]  and left-hand side underneath the California flag of the bear in distress. And you watch
[38:44.680 --> 38:49.320]  it and every person, except for two young women who were obviously sisters, they say,
[38:49.320 --> 38:52.520]  I don't wanna turn my guns in, I own guns.
[38:52.520 --> 38:59.800]  Everyone else, he said, we're gonna play at the moment. We're going to go and arrest the
[38:59.800 --> 39:05.220]  evil white tea party people and take their guns. And by the way, I'm gonna send my reporters
[39:05.220 --> 39:10.000]  out to go one step further and say, you know what, these people haven't paid their fair
[39:10.000 --> 39:14.800]  share. Let's have 100% taxes on them and put them in forced labor camps.
[39:14.800 --> 39:20.260]  And I guarantee you, I will find people at the University of Texas ready to put you in
[39:20.260 --> 39:25.440]  a forced labor camp. Because to them, they go watch zombie movies and death all day cuz
[39:25.440 --> 39:29.760]  it thrills them because they've never been in even a fistfight or a car wreck. Or they've
[39:29.760 --> 39:33.140]  never sat there and watched somebody in a car wreck with their throat slit and blood
[39:33.140 --> 39:36.440]  spraying all over them. They've never been in the real thing. They all live completely
[39:36.440 --> 39:37.440]  sheltered lives.
[39:37.440 --> 39:44.280]  And it just sounds powerful to put us in a forced labor camp. You understand these are
[39:44.280 --> 39:49.180]  sick freaks who would have gotten on their knees to any of history's tyrants and done
[39:49.180 --> 39:54.580]  whatever they said. Because deep down, they're so cowardly. Deep down, they're so scared.
[39:54.580 --> 40:01.280]  Deep down, they are so freaked out by evil that they run to it begging. See, the ultimate
[40:01.280 --> 40:03.260]  coward is delusional.
[40:03.260 --> 40:11.500]  And they decide to embrace this garbage. Let's go and play an excerpt of the video that unprecedented
[40:11.500 --> 40:15.880]  Drudge knows is so important. We appreciate that. That's why I went with it. Even though
[40:15.880 --> 40:21.280]  Mark Dice has been a critic of me, I don't even care. This video needs to be seen. See,
[40:21.280 --> 40:23.060]  I'm totally becoming free now.
[40:23.060 --> 40:27.620]  I just don't even care. I don't care if they arrest me. I don't care if I get killed. I
[40:27.620 --> 40:33.460]  don't care if people lie about me, twist things. I don't care anymore. Because I understand
[40:33.460 --> 40:39.220]  the mega massive evil of the New World Order is what has to be dealt with.
[40:39.220 --> 40:43.660]  That's what I'm fighting. I'm fighting the abortion. I'm fighting the attempt to disarm
[40:43.660 --> 40:48.060]  us and enslave us and complete our journey to slavery. I'm fighting for our national
[40:48.060 --> 40:53.040]  sovereignty. I'm fighting for our borders. I'm fighting for our republic. I'm fighting
[40:53.040 --> 40:58.340]  for our Constitution. And I'm fighting against the Federal Reserve shareholders that openly
[40:58.340 --> 41:03.900]  say that they're funding all the anti-gun, anti-family, globalist organizations who are
[41:03.900 --> 41:10.420]  wanting 80% or higher tax rates on you and your family to transfer your money to them.
[41:10.420 --> 41:16.940]  Not to just become rich, but to bankrupt you. I stand for prosperity, and I stand for liberty,
[41:16.940 --> 41:20.660]  and I stand for being honest and decent and telling the truth.
[41:20.660 --> 41:25.780]  And I call for everyone else who loves liberty to have your voice be heard today. And I said
[41:25.780 --> 41:30.880]  this yesterday on the Sunday show, and I'm gonna say it again. If you are a talk show
[41:30.880 --> 41:38.580]  host or web person or journalist or preacher or police officer or counselor or medical
[41:38.580 --> 41:47.740]  doctor, a person of influence, a Federal Reserve employee.
[41:47.740 --> 41:51.900]  My great uncle was pretty high up in the Dallas Federal Reserve and came to know it was all
[41:51.900 --> 41:58.100]  evil and bad before he died listening to me on the radio in Dallas. Uncle Billy, great
[41:58.100 --> 42:02.180]  guy, great World War II vet, just amazing person. My grandmother's brother, she's still
[42:02.180 --> 42:13.260]  alive. My whole issue is, ladies and gentlemen, for everybody out there, for everybody out
[42:13.260 --> 42:17.860]  there, what I'm asking you, what I'm begging you to do is to realize you've been taught
[42:17.860 --> 42:19.820]  going along is what gets you there.
[42:19.820 --> 42:24.540]  No, no, it was going along that got us into this position and got us leveraged into debt
[42:24.540 --> 42:33.080]  that's not ours to make us bondage slaves, bond slaves. That's what a bond slave is,
[42:33.080 --> 42:38.540]  your bond, because your family sold you. You could come from a free family in the Middle
[42:38.540 --> 42:44.340]  East, read the Bible, and your family could sell you as a bond slave just 200 years ago
[42:44.340 --> 42:46.300]  before they began abolishing it.
[42:46.300 --> 42:49.720]  And they didn't abolish it in Germany till about 160 years ago. That's when they finally
[42:49.720 --> 42:55.060]  phased it out. Bond slave, your parents could take you even from a good family and could
[42:55.060 --> 43:01.580]  sell you as an indentured slave. But you'll never be taught that in the media because
[43:01.580 --> 43:07.300]  they want blacks to have a inferiority complex and to be racist and to hate all white people
[43:07.300 --> 43:14.800]  to not even know that Germany didn't abolish all of its slavery until the 1880s.
[43:14.800 --> 43:22.780]  White slaves. Wasn't even Germany yet, but it got it got unified right around that time.
[43:22.780 --> 43:30.380]  Germania, Austrian, Hungarian Empire. The point is, is that I want a future and I'm
[43:30.380 --> 43:34.440]  sick of watching. Man, I tell you, even though it's interesting, have you ever watched Big
[43:34.440 --> 43:39.660]  Fish Hunt Little Fish and you see him eating the fish, you see a fish run and you root
[43:39.660 --> 43:44.700]  for him and it gets pinned up against a rock and then eaten.
[43:44.700 --> 43:48.700]  And then the fish is so big compared to the bass that's eating it, it struggles, you see
[43:48.700 --> 43:56.820]  its little eyes as the bass sucks it into its gullet. And you feel sad for the fish.
[43:56.820 --> 44:03.940]  Folks, I feel a thousand times sadder for all the babies getting chopped up. And it's
[44:03.940 --> 44:08.220]  cuz I'm not because I'm a hero or a good guy.
[44:08.220 --> 44:14.560]  It's a normal response of empathy. There it is, debtors, prison, legal in more than one
[44:14.560 --> 44:21.100]  third of US states. And by the way, that's totally unconstitutional. Eddie Craig did
[44:21.100 --> 44:28.160]  a two and a half hour presentation that's at prisonplanet.tv on all of this, Bills of
[44:28.160 --> 44:29.580]  Attainer, all of it.
[44:29.580 --> 44:34.460]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, America is not a free country anymore. There's islands of
[44:34.460 --> 44:41.300]  free media left, barely. The White House is openly going after them. And again, a lot
[44:41.300 --> 44:46.380]  of you are gonna think, yeah, Alex, we actually know it's tyranny. We're gonna shut up and
[44:46.380 --> 44:49.840]  we will run and we will live, yes, for at least a while.
[44:49.840 --> 44:56.460]  But many years from now, lying in your beds, what would you do to just once come back here
[44:56.460 --> 45:01.020]  and tell our enemies, you can take our lives, but you'll never take our freedom. And you
[45:01.020 --> 45:06.700]  know what William Wallace lost? He won a few battles with him, was killed by Treasury.
[45:06.700 --> 45:14.300]  That's a historical fact. That's a real story, folks. But right after he was killed, Scotland
[45:14.300 --> 45:25.860]  got its independence. And then of course, it was another battle, the imperial system,
[45:25.860 --> 45:31.700]  the Viking system, the Norman system that had conquered England, was able to conquer
[45:31.700 --> 45:32.700]  him again.
[45:32.700 --> 45:37.940]  But the whole point is it's an eternal struggle. And it's the same thing over and over again.
[45:37.940 --> 45:43.220]  Your children, let me explain this, are already having GMO fed to them. They're already pushing
[45:43.220 --> 45:48.540]  vaccines, trying to make a mandatory worldwide by fraud, already making a mandatory, lying
[45:48.540 --> 45:53.620]  and saying it's mandatory. We're already in a criminal society because people keep saying
[45:53.620 --> 45:57.380]  yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, to tyranny.
[45:57.380 --> 46:04.660]  And your children are walking dead, many of them already. They've done all this in rodent
[46:04.660 --> 46:10.060]  studies with guinea pigs, rats, mice, you name it. We've covered it, we sell books that
[46:10.060 --> 46:19.700]  cover it. We break it all down. In Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, in the genetic
[46:19.700 --> 46:24.220]  roulette books we sell, all of it.
[46:24.220 --> 46:30.060]  We're now going into the second generation of real soft kill. And you can already see
[46:30.060 --> 46:34.980]  the cancer rates, the way that people look, the health problems, all of it. What happens
[46:34.980 --> 46:40.300]  to the rats fed the GMO across the board? It's cuz it's designed to do it, every one
[46:40.300 --> 46:41.300]  of the crops.
[46:41.300 --> 46:47.540]  It's not like it's an accident it does it. There's a reason the Monsanto Laboratories
[46:47.540 --> 46:52.300]  for 15 years, all of their scientists refused to eat GMO and have it trucked in to their
[46:52.300 --> 46:57.980]  cafeteria as non-GMO. There's a reason all the ruling class won't eat GMO on record.
[46:57.980 --> 47:03.140]  Just look it up. Chinese communists have secret gardens, non-GMO. British royalty have secret
[47:03.140 --> 47:05.100]  gardens, non-GMO.
[47:05.100 --> 47:10.500]  Rich elite will not even touch it. Because I mean, would they grab a cobra out of the
[47:10.500 --> 47:15.020]  bushes and slap it on their arm? I mean, of course you wouldn't. But we're brought up
[47:15.020 --> 47:22.180]  in it so we don't know. First generation, the guinea pigs begun to be obese, lower IQs,
[47:22.180 --> 47:25.220]  smaller genitals, lower sperm counts.
[47:25.220 --> 47:32.340]  By second generation, off the chart cancer, obesity, deformity of the organs, almost complete
[47:32.340 --> 47:40.980]  infertility. Third generation, guys show guinea pigs, just type in guinea pigs, hair on tongues.
[47:40.980 --> 47:47.680]  That'll pull up the studies and photos. Hair on the tongues, 99.9% sterility, tumors growing
[47:47.680 --> 47:54.980]  all over them. I mean, the wages of the New World Order is death.
[47:54.980 --> 47:58.740]  And you go out to California, where they're getting hit by the radiation clouds, where
[47:58.740 --> 48:03.740]  they're under the GMO, where all this is happening, ladies and gentlemen. And you go out to LA
[48:03.740 --> 48:09.420]  or San Diego or Malibu Beach, and you say to people, let's arrest all the gun owners.
[48:09.420 --> 48:15.980]  And you can even throw in, let's put them in a forced labor camp and everyone, 90% of
[48:15.980 --> 48:22.780]  the people will sign it and they get excited. Yeah, you don't have to tell me, buddy. Because
[48:22.780 --> 48:27.460]  this to them is just they're fantasizing about darkness.
[48:27.460 --> 48:32.540]  They're fantasizing about sexy power. Let's go ahead and go to a clip of Californians.
[48:32.540 --> 48:38.460]  He's like, yeah, the evil YT party, we need to arrest them, take their guns. You don't
[48:38.460 --> 48:43.660]  have to tell me, buddy. And he says he signs with pleasure. You don't have to tell me.
[48:43.660 --> 48:47.620]  And again, the reason this is such a genius video is if you all go out and do this and
[48:47.620 --> 48:53.260]  talk with the same, you gotta shuffle when you walk up. And you've gotta go, I'm serious,
[48:53.260 --> 48:54.260]  it's a cult thing.
[48:54.260 --> 48:59.100]  The government cult talks like NPR, they're in a trance. You gotta go, arrest the whites,
[48:59.100 --> 49:03.900]  take their guns, FEMA camp. They will get excited and they'll do the same little head
[49:03.900 --> 49:09.640]  bob with you and look at you in personal self-disgust of each other. And then go, yeah, let's do
[49:09.640 --> 49:13.100]  it cuz it's decadent and slimy to desecrate freedom.
[49:13.100 --> 49:18.060]  And they'll go, yeah, let's arrest the gun owners, yeah, let's do it. We're sick freaks,
[49:18.060 --> 49:20.380]  let's do it. Let's go ahead and go back to the tape, here it is.
[49:20.380 --> 49:25.260]  Just a name and a signature. We're trying to just repeal the Second Amendment to make
[49:25.260 --> 49:30.520]  sure that only the criminals have the guns and get them out of the hands of the law-abiding
[49:30.520 --> 49:31.520]  citizens.
[49:31.520 --> 49:38.580]  To repeal the Second Amendment, it's such an old-fashioned amendment. We're just making
[49:38.580 --> 49:43.020]  sure that the law-abiding gun owners have that right taken away.
[49:43.020 --> 49:44.020]  All right.
[49:44.020 --> 49:50.140]  Thank you so much. We're gonna repeal the Second Amendment. Only the police and the
[49:50.140 --> 49:57.980]  military need to have guns. We can trust them, they've never done anything wrong. And we're
[49:57.980 --> 50:01.860]  just gonna get the legal registered guns off the street.
[50:01.860 --> 50:04.060]  You don't have to convince us, my friend.
[50:04.060 --> 50:10.820]  This will remove all the law-abiding registered gun owners and then the criminals sign. The
[50:10.820 --> 50:16.500]  criminals won't turn their guns in, so they'll still have their guns after we repeal the
[50:16.500 --> 50:22.060]  Second Amendment. Thanks for supporting that. Come on, bro, you don't want the kids to die
[50:22.060 --> 50:24.140]  in another massacre like Sandy Hook?
[50:24.140 --> 50:29.500]  Not at all, but I just feel excited to hear it. I'm sorry, man.
[50:29.500 --> 50:31.500]  We're gonna repeal the Second Amendment.
[50:31.500 --> 50:32.500]  All right, that's good.
[50:32.500 --> 50:41.500]  Full video up at DrudgeReport.com, left-hand side right there on Drudge Report. Californians
[50:41.500 --> 50:47.340]  signed petition to ban and confiscate firearms. And the new news that's out, big shits coordinating
[50:47.340 --> 50:52.900]  gun confiscations. It's official, she's the one directing state police everywhere to illegally
[50:52.900 --> 50:57.980]  take veterans' guns without even a psychological adjudication that they're mentally ill. The
[50:57.980 --> 51:02.420]  kidnapping of veterans.
[51:02.420 --> 51:03.420]  Time and time again.

[51:09.100 --> 51:12.420]  Those we should be able to depend on, let us down.
[51:12.420 --> 51:17.060]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way, while the folks here in
[51:17.060 --> 51:19.100]  Bell Harbor say show me.

[54:15.940 --> 54:21.460]  By repealing the Second Amendment, what that'll do is we'll have a door-to-door gun confiscation
[54:21.460 --> 54:26.940]  against the white people, the right wing extremists. Okay. Take away their guns. Well, birthday.
[54:26.940 --> 54:31.820]  Oh, my birthday. Yeah, your birthday. Yeah, just repealing the Second Amendment, door-to-door
[54:31.820 --> 54:36.860]  gun confiscations, then that way only the unregistered guns will be out and we'll be
[54:36.860 --> 54:40.260]  much safer that way. Thank you for supporting that.
[54:40.260 --> 54:44.460]  No doubt, no doubt. Just a name, man, signature. All right, that's enough. Again, get this
[54:44.460 --> 54:52.300]  video. It's up at Infowars.com. But the easiest place to find it is DrudgeReport.com on the
[54:52.300 --> 54:59.860]  left-hand side. You see a big old California, Republic of California flag. America, Californians
[54:59.860 --> 55:05.940]  move to ban, seize guns, carry foreign students scared of guns in the US. We're gonna go to
[55:05.940 --> 55:06.940]  that in a moment.
[55:06.940 --> 55:13.120]  Senator, background checks amount to new tax. Yeah, that's the plan. Rifts in both parties
[55:13.120 --> 55:17.980]  complicate odds for bill developing, but they'll get it after the next stage suiting. Nanny
[55:17.980 --> 55:23.420]  Bloomberg, if you sell a gun to your son, something's wrong in your family. This is
[55:23.420 --> 55:27.420]  a guy who has bodyguards, owns guns, owns jet copters.
[55:27.420 --> 55:32.700]  I mean, he's just a total predator. There was an article, he was interviewed where he
[55:32.700 --> 55:36.340]  said, I'm a technocrat. I love knowing everything about you and tracking it. I'll plan your
[55:36.340 --> 55:46.780]  life. No, you won't, you sick freak. You sicko. Critics question use of new NSA data center,
[55:46.780 --> 55:48.980]  working with Facebook, with attorney generals.
[55:48.980 --> 55:54.820]  They're just spying on everything. And the collapse is beginning. State buses, hundreds
[55:54.820 --> 56:01.320]  of mentally ill patients to cities around the country. And again, ladies and gentlemen,
[56:01.320 --> 56:12.260]  what you've got to do is you've got to go out to areas in your community and go to these
[56:12.260 --> 56:18.060]  anti-gun rallies. And ladies and gentlemen, shoot video, go up and say, hi, I'm a communist.
[56:18.060 --> 56:23.020]  I want to arrest all gun owners. And the people will say to you, especially if you have a
[56:23.020 --> 56:25.820]  hidden camera, they'll go, yes, my brother, soon is the time.
[56:25.820 --> 56:29.460]  And I've been telling my reporters for months, this is what I want to do. We're going to
[56:29.460 --> 56:34.020]  do it. I mean, we already sent reporters out and they said, here in Austin, once we register
[56:34.020 --> 56:37.400]  the guns, we're going to take them. And you've got to go and show people, this is a cult
[56:37.400 --> 56:42.820]  of freak weirdos who just are in love with tyranny because they're so weak individually.
[56:42.820 --> 56:46.960]  They get off on this idea, but just go to gun rallies and go, soon, my brother, we will
[56:46.960 --> 56:51.020]  have the communism and we will arrest our enemies and put them in FEMA centers.
[56:51.020 --> 56:54.300]  And they're like, yes, my brother, because I've been to some of these things. I've been
[56:54.300 --> 56:58.580]  around these people. You think I'm joking? I have footage of them, communists in New
[56:58.580 --> 57:03.980]  York saying we're going to put all the gun owners in Stalin camps. And I said, but Stalin
[57:03.980 --> 57:08.020]  killed people. And they go, yeah, too bad he didn't kill you. We were going to kill
[57:08.020 --> 57:09.020]  you.
[57:09.020 --> 57:13.500]  And of course, they couldn't kill a paper bag. But don't worry, they'll take your money,
[57:13.500 --> 57:20.620]  hire mercenaries to do it. You understand? Let's go to Kerry saying kids are scared to
[57:20.620 --> 57:24.380]  come to America because of the guns. What, from their countries where only the government
[57:24.380 --> 57:25.980]  has the guns? Here it is.
[57:25.980 --> 57:30.020]  I've heard in a couple of quiet conversations with a few officials-
[57:30.020 --> 57:34.700]  Man, he's had Botox.
[57:34.700 --> 57:38.740]  How safe it is over here in this country where people are not running around with guns.
[57:38.740 --> 57:40.260]  That's what evil does to you.
[57:40.260 --> 57:41.260]  And number two-
[57:41.260 --> 57:43.980]  Look how empty he is.
[57:43.980 --> 57:51.420]  How some students, we had an interesting discussion about why fewer students are coming to, particularly
[57:51.420 --> 57:58.860]  from Japan, to study in the United States. And one of the responses I got from our officials,
[57:58.860 --> 58:04.060]  from conversations with parents here, is that they're actually scared. They think they're
[58:04.060 --> 58:05.580]  not safe in the United States.
[58:05.580 --> 58:10.260]  Well, yeah, they're not safe from you. Actual travel studies show that people are scared
[58:10.260 --> 58:15.380]  of the government and the checkpoints and the TSA. That's real, not lies coming out
[58:15.380 --> 58:16.380]  of your mouth.
[58:16.380 --> 58:20.740]  Now, here's the FBI's own statistics over the last 20 years. Forty-nine percent drop
[58:20.740 --> 58:25.420]  in crime rate. And you and your brethren criminals, street thugs are just like Kerry. He's just
[58:25.420 --> 58:30.580]  a bigger one. They all instinctively hate good people. This place is up to you. They
[58:30.580 --> 58:35.980]  hate you. Do you understand that? These criminals hate you because you're a good person. Figure
[58:35.980 --> 58:40.500]  that out. They're evil. Stay with us.
[58:40.500 --> 58:48.340]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:48.340 --> 58:56.180]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our
[58:56.180 --> 59:01.820]  immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing

[59:25.500 --> 59:31.040]  at the surface. But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin-nourishing
[59:31.040 --> 59:36.100]  chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the
[59:36.100 --> 59:44.540]  silver more effectively. Visit www.silverlungs.com and click on our store page to find what silver-based

[59:53.660 --> 01:00:07.100]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. Big brother, mainstream
[01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:16.420]  media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN
[01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:24.580]  radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:32.300]  I have met at my office one of the assistant, well, one of the prosecutors, not the head
[01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:37.980]  Austin prosecutor. And they came to my office because they were, well, I'm not going to
[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:41.700]  get into the whole story. And they showed me their card and I knew who they were with.
[01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:46.780]  That's how they were brought here. And I looked the person up. It was about a year ago, two
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:52.060]  years ago now. And they told me, they said, listen, the judges give illegal aliens $5
[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:54.020]  fines for drunk driving.
[01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:58.820]  And even if they run over somebody, they don't get charged. And we've just been told, do
[01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:04.140]  it. And then I also covered how banks, like 10 years ago, came out and said, we give illegal
[01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:09.820]  aliens loans with no IDs, no proof, as part of a program to incentivize coming to America.
[01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:14.020]  Just like you can have your babies for free, and they put ads in Mexican newspapers, come
[01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:15.020]  up and have your kids for free.
[01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:19.140]  It's about bankrupting America. The globalists are just going to loan America more fiat dollars
[01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:26.180]  to get real infrastructure. So anyway, if it's a $5 million cast of shrimp on treadmills,
[01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:30.740]  I'm not joking. I think it was a $5 million. Guys, look up study of shrimp on treadmills.
[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:37.940]  I think it was 5 mil a few years ago. Or whether it's a $10 million UT female masturbation
[01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:44.220]  study, or whether it's a study to teach elementary students how to masturbate, $100 million program,
[01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:46.940]  Jocelyn Elders, whatever.
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:51.700]  Any way they can bankrupt us and just get us used to walking all over us. Here's the
[01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:57.920]  new article. There it is. Tax dollars fund shrimp on treadmills. Jell-O Wrestling and
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:03.300]  Antarctica Report says federal research agency mismanaged 3 billion.
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:12.300]  Alex, you exaggerate. You said 5 million, it was 3 billion. Yeah, no, I remember the
[01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:16.340]  headline. It was 5 million for shrimp on treadmills. I think that's the Fox News headline. I think
[01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:24.380]  it was 5 million out of the 3 billion. But again, and they will take an old lady's house
[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:27.340]  who's eating dog food in the poorest part of Austin.
[01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:30.500]  I've done these reports years ago when I could have time to do local reports, but you know
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:35.860]  about it. When an old 80-year-old woman can't pay her property taxes and is on $600 a month
[01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:41.580]  Social Security and has all these medical bills and literally, literally have to go
[01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:47.460]  get charity. And I tell you, I used to do my AXS TV show and I'd do one report on old
[01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:51.340]  people and I'd get hundreds of calls to my comment line with no crew.
[01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:55.320]  And I would hear these old ladies and old men begging going, I'm over here in a trailer
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:03:00.580]  and they say they're gonna take my plot. The trailer's only worth probably 20,000. I've
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:06.260]  been in it 30 something years, there's holes in the roof. But they want it and they're
[01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:09.340]  coming next week to take my trailer.
[01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:18.860]  They're coming next week to take my trailer. And I have like 100 phone calls. Mike Hansen
[01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:22.800]  used to take it over for me and he couldn't listen to it. He'll drive you crazy. You can't
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:31.140]  even call him back, much less go out there. And you go out there and one guy's got colon
[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:36.840]  cancer and you see blood and bandages seeping out of his trousers.
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:42.580]  And he's sitting there going, yeah, I was in the quarry, I wore my life, died of cancer.
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:48.180]  They're gonna take my in the three inch grass, but I got out and I mowed it, I mowed it,
[01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:53.780]  I mowed it. And I guess I'm trying to beat this cancer right now. If they won't take
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:04:00.740]  back the two weeks I was in the hospital, three inch grass, $2,000 fines a day and other
[01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:02.500]  objectionable material.
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:07.620]  And the zone person, I've had my hat in my hand. And I said, sir, I can't move these
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:13.700]  logs in the backyard. And I'm trying to get a company in to do it, but I'm on Social Security.
[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:17.540]  And for some reason, the VA don't send a check no more. They're looking at you with all their
[01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:25.380]  teeth missing. Mr. Jones, I wanna thank you. And that's why I can't do this anymore.
[01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:32.420]  Show that Obama can spend millions of dollars a night in a hotel and Biden can spend $500,000
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:37.700]  while they're shooting kids up with poison shots. And I could get hundreds of calls a
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:41.140]  week. They always target old people, the zoning department.
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:44.460]  And man, they take their houses and throw them in a nursing home. And now they wear
[01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:48.860]  uniforms with police badges. I wanna tell all those people something. You're not gonna
[01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:54.780]  get away with this. I hope you know God is gonna strike your butt down. You are cursed.
[01:04:54.780 --> 01:05:24.700]  You understand that? We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[01:05:54.780 --> 01:06:12.700]  We'll be right back.
[01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:34.620]  We'll be right back.
[01:06:34.620 --> 01:07:00.540]  We'll be right back.
[01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:18.460]  We'll be right back.
[01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:40.380]  We'll be right back.
[01:07:40.380 --> 01:08:00.300]  We'll be right back.
[01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:12.620]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:24.300]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:35.260]  You know, the Obama people like to quote the Bible and say, Thou shalt not kill. But if
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:42.980]  you actually go to the Hebrew and Greek translations, thou shalt not murder means in cold blood
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:51.400]  wrongly someone who's innocent. And that's the common law of all cultures. What is basically
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:56.420]  illegal is going and killing someone who's done nothing.
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:09:01.220]  Knocking somebody on the head to basically rob them. And my son heard me talking about
[01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:06.620]  people that hurt innocents, how it will come back on them. And he happened to have in his
[01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:13.740]  book bag, he's here with me today, discovers Bible, a large print Bible for early readers.
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:23.460]  And he was reading me from Genesis 21, 9, verse 6. Anyone who murders man will be killed
[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:28.300]  by man. This is because I have made man in my own likeness.
[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:37.540]  So anyone who murders, murders, murders, just to say thou shalt not kill. No, it's thou
[01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:42.100]  shalt not murder. Because you can see the government saying they're gonna kill whole
[01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:47.700]  villages to get one bad guy. Why is that supposedly okay? Well, that is wrong. That is unjust
[01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:57.500]  war. And we've just accepted so many out of control things in this society.
[01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:05.240]  Now is the time to realize that the people are perishing for lack of knowledge. But again,
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:17.320]  there it is, Genesis 821. Is that chapter 9, verse 6. Anyone who murders man will be
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:22.820]  killed by man. That is because I have made man in my own likeness. That's the same thing
[01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:25.060]  as those that live by the sword, die by the sword.
[01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:29.020]  It doesn't mean having a sword or defending yourself, you're gonna be killed by the sword.
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:36.180]  It means those that live by the sword. Living, you're out taking with the sword, you will
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:40.780]  surely die by the sword. All of you that serve evil and think you're gonna be on the winning
[01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:44.340]  team because you're so scared of the system, you think you'll just, well, that's the winning
[01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:45.340]  team.
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:50.720]  I'll go curl up to that. You lead cursed lives for a reason. Your family's breaking up for
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:55.380]  a reason. Your child, because you trusted the system and took all the vaccines and eat
[01:10:55.380 --> 01:11:01.380]  them. No, because you lie to yourself. You're going to be cursed by your own actions. And
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:06.500]  that's not mumbo jumbo. That's not magic. That's common sense. Thank you, son, for bringing
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:07.500]  the book in.
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:12.420]  All right, I wanna open the phones up in this second hour. A lot of stations join us in

[01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:52.240]  share. Give it to friends and family. I say you can probably give it up to 50 people and
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:57.060]  just say, hey, here's your gift of a username passcode to see all these films in high def,
[01:11:57.060 --> 01:12:01.540]  to see the Nightly News, to see video of the radio show.
[01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:05.140]  Also send people the free iPhone app or the free Android apps that are in the listen page
[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:10.220]  of infowars.com. Just click on that tab or prisonplanet.com will take you there. I mean,
[01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:15.020]  the Eddie Craig presents how to protect your rights as an American citizen, Air Force officer,
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:19.100]  and then of course, Nacogdoches Sheriff's deputy that saw the corruption and stood up
[01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:24.100]  against it. Probably one of the best, most well-spoken, not patriot mythology, but real
[01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:29.260]  hardcore pro se, just showing how basically everything the police do is illegal now.
[01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:33.780]  And most police don't even know it, because it's all done in legalese. Police all need
[01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:39.580]  to see it. Prisonplanet.tv, and again, that just pays for the bandwidth. If you wanna
[01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:44.060]  support us by the Propure water filters, the lowest price out there, promo code water at
[01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:49.340]  infowarsstore.com. Promo code water gets you 10% off the already lowest price. We've now
[01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:55.500]  launched the seed center, a year of research, the best reviews, the non-GMO, non-hybrid
[01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:56.780]  heirloom seeds.
[01:12:56.780 --> 01:13:03.180]  We've got cases that have 50,000 seeds at the lowest price, 5,000 seeds at the lowest
[01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:09.220]  price, 50,000, 10,000. We're now carrying six different companies, six different brands
[01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:18.380]  at infowarsstore.com. And these seeds will save many of them 100 years, by the way. So
[01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:25.020]  you can also buy a couple of this seed vault. It's a great system. The seed arc is amazing.
[01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:28.140]  All of it, and they all calculate basically out at the same price, depends on how many
[01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:29.360]  seeds you get.
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:33.800]  And we have these at the lowest prices. I've instructed Weldon Henson, who heads up the
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:39.260]  store with Matt back there, to have the lowest prices unless somebody's doing a bait and
[01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:45.740]  switch on eBay or something. But the point is, is that this supports the broadcast. We
[01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:50.620]  sell things we believe in. Infowarshealth.com, the best vitamins, minerals products they're
[01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:56.500]  purchasing from us, also funds the operation so we can boldly go 110% up against the enemy.
[01:13:56.500 --> 01:14:01.960]  Now, I wanna give the number out on these articles. What do you think of gold being
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:06.300]  artificially plunged? I mean, it's on record. It's all staged. I'm gonna get some experts
[01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:11.940]  on this week. Anybody can pull up the articles where they admit the big banks go in there
[01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:12.940]  and short sell.
[01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:19.020]  They go in there and they, naked short, they go in there and they manipulate. They put
[01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:26.940]  out contracts, puts that it's gonna go down and then have the media hype it up. And then
[01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:33.180]  basically sell also their own gold holdings into the market at reduced prices. I mean,
[01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:38.340]  Gordon Brown sold England's, what was it, a decade ago or more gold supply at a third
[01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:39.340]  of what it was worth.
[01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:45.740]  You can look that up. I mean, it is just crazy what they're doing. And I've told people,
[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:51.040]  they can drive anything down. They can do anything artificial now, but not long term.
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:58.300]  They can do anything. They could probably make gold be worth zero, down to 10 cents.
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:02.420]  But in the real market, it won't be. And at that price, you wouldn't be able to buy any.
[01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:05.940]  They could say the moon was made out of cheese. They could say two plus two equal 10. And
[01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:09.940]  they now teach that in public schools. They actually teach it could be whatever you think
[01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:13.480]  to just create total disassociation from reality.
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:18.620]  I think that right now, the question is, do we all work for central bankers? That's what
[01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:23.700]  I want to address to our guests tonight. Is this global governance at last? Is it one
[01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:29.840]  world the central bankers in charge? Jim Iorio, you say we've got some downside here, a correction
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:34.740]  in the markets. Fine. But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks
[01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:39.780]  do? Aren't we all just counting on the fact that there's a Bernanke put and that we won't
[01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:43.500]  go any lower than, say, five percent down from here?
[01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:47.080]  Of course we are, because if we look at the economic data, there's nothing to get excited
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:53.700]  about in that. So yesterday, we saw some reluctance for the Bernanke Fed to expand their balance.
[01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:58.140]  Now, separately, it's in the Financial Times of London, AP Reuters, Time Magazine, that
[01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:01.980]  hey, there's a global government run by private mega banks. They're gonna need 100 trillion
[01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:09.060]  in the next decade of your tax money via carbon taxes, Tobin taxes, and global VAT.
[01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:12.740]  And they're gonna fix the world economy by running the planet. And by the way, they're
[01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:17.740]  exempt from the taxes themselves, from EU bureaucrats up. But if you go, hey, I think
[01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:22.340]  that's a terrible idea. They go, whoa, Southern Barbie Law Center, ADL, this doesn't exist.
[01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:26.700]  There are crazy people that believe there's a global takeover by mega banks. Yeah, the
[01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:29.260]  John Birch Society, they said that in the 50s.
[01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:35.180]  Man, they're really bad people for being absolutely accurate 60 plus years before their time because
[01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:38.940]  they had high level military officers that weren't traitors who were let in on the operation
[01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:44.820]  that warned them. Man, yeah, they're kooks. Yeah, those patriots, that Alex Jones, he
[01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:49.460]  said 17 years ago they were setting up a new world order run by mega banks cuz he happened
[01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:53.300]  to have read books by Barry Goldwater who was witnessing it all as a senator.
[01:16:53.300 --> 01:17:04.980]  Yeah, man, he's a bad guy for being informed. I mean, this is getting so out of control.
[01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:10.700]  This is a war against reality. And I want your take on this clip. Again, that's up at
[01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:14.860]  drugsreport.com on the left hand side. I'm gonna have it reposted, have them repost it
[01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:15.860]  too.
[01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:22.420]  I want at Prison Planet Info Wars, red link. It's got the clips of Californians saying
[01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:28.700]  arrest the partiers, take all their guns, put them in jail, here it is.
[01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:34.220]  By repealing the Second Amendment, what that'll do is we'll have a door to door gun confiscation
[01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:39.780]  against the white people, the right wing extremists. Take away their guns, a birthday.
[01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:43.900]  What's the, my birthday? Yeah, your birthday, yeah. Just repealing the Second Amendment,
[01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:49.020]  door to door gun confiscations, then that way only the unregistered guns will be out
[01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:51.100]  and we'll be much safer that way.
[01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:53.980]  Thank you for supporting that. No doubt, no doubt.
[01:17:53.980 --> 01:18:00.020]  It just goes on and on, that's enough. Full video at infowars.com, full video at drugsreport.com.
[01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:05.380]  But I'm telling you, all of you, it's time to fight. Take your iPhone, take your camera.
[01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:08.980]  You don't have to be a, quote, expert to fight the tyranny. These are zombies you're talking
[01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:09.980]  about.
[01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:13.580]  You're like a god compared to them. I'm very sad for them, but literally. Go out to an
[01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:17.100]  anti-gun rally or go to a Democratic Party rally. Have a hidden camera, they're very
[01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:23.220]  cheap now. But it's a public rally, so you're allowed to show people, even though they don't
[01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:24.380]  know.
[01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:29.920]  Make sure that you're a one-party consent state. But technically, if it's a public place
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:33.420]  that can be hidden, but they still may try to charge you if you're not. Just type in
[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:38.300]  your state, your state's wiretapping laws. Only, I think, 14 of them say you can't tape
[01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:41.960]  or videotape people without them knowing.
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:45.220]  But again, that's not even in a public place, but the cops are arresting people that film
[01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:49.100]  on the side of the highway. If you film cops in Illinois from your own car, they take you
[01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:53.940]  to jail. It doesn't matter how many times the court throw it out. The point is, I think
[01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:59.100]  everybody, to give a little lesson there on filming in public is such a free country.
[01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:05.100]  You go out and go to their meetings and go, yeah, man, I think we ought to just arrest
[01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:09.020]  all the libertarians and put them in a forced labor camp. And then they could be productive
[01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:10.700]  part of the economy.
[01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:14.820]  And I guarantee you, they're gonna say, yes, yes, do what Veritas Project's done, do what
[01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:19.260]  we do, do what Mark Dice has done. I'm telling you, we've got to have a counter-offensive
[01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:24.480]  against their counter-offensive and really go show who they are. That's what will bring
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:25.480]  them down.
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:30.620]  I mean, I've gotten video over the years of them saying they're gonna bring in world government,
[01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:35.300]  they're gonna break up the family. Now they say it publicly. I wanna get your take on
[01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:45.500]  all this 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231. And this is the big news up at infowars.com right now.
[01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:52.060]  Big sis coordinating gun confiscations. And this also just broke at infowars.com because
[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:58.140]  an illegal alien had a unique cultural background. He's allowed to... Well, I'm gonna tell you
[01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:02.860]  about this when we come back.
[01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:07.580]  Ceramic body armor is rated to stop six hits. But what about the seventh? Unlike ceramic
[01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:12.820]  or Kevlar, Infidel body armor is proven to take hit after hit, and it just won't quit.
[01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:16.940]  Reasonably priced and designed for the smart civilian prefer. Infidel stops hundreds of
[01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:22.100]  hits from small arms to high-powered rifles. That means safety and peace of mind. Buy yours
[01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:30.020]  at infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L, bodyarmor.com. Infidel body armor just won't
[01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:31.020]  quit.
[01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:34.780]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:39.020]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having a lead back at interest, forcing taxes
[01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:43.140]  to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:46.980]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing
[01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:49.900]  army. Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our

[01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:07.660]  The coming financial collapse is real. The subsequent social unrest will happen, even

[01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:05.940]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011,
[01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:11.180]  storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012,
[01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:15.420]  we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of
[01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:19.900]  sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is, you are.
[01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:24.820]  We all are. Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control
[01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:29.700]  Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability
[01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:34.140]  of your food supply with e Foods Direct. Be prepared before you need it with nutrient-dense

[01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:57.980]  out their spring specials. Again, that number is 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:22:57.980 --> 01:23:03.260]  You can bet your life on e Foods Direct. We've lived in this neighborhood for years.
[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:08.100]  We have an alarm system and all of our doors have deadbolts. They kicked in our door and
[01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:12.660]  were in and out of our house in about five minutes. The police arrived in about 20 minutes,
[01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:18.460]  but they were long gone with our TV, jewelry, and my guns. I kept thinking, what if my family
[01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:23.260]  had been home? The police officer said that more than 85 percent of break-ins are through
[01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:29.780]  a door and that deadbolts alone don't stop intruders. The officer told me to go to easyarmor.net
[01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:34.660]  if we wanted something that would actually stop an intruder. Easy Armor reinforces all
[01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:39.940]  of the weak points on your doors and is guaranteed to prevent kick-ins. I was surprised at how
[01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:46.660]  little Easy Armor costs, and I installed Easy Armor in about 30 minutes. Visit easyarmor.net.
[01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:55.340]  That's the letters E-Z-A-R-M-O-R dot net. Or call 888-58-ARMOR. That's 888-582-7667.
[01:23:55.340 --> 01:24:22.260]  Easy Armor dot net. Ultimate door security made easy.
[01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:29.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are capturing it right now. During the break, out there on
[01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:33.020]  the television, and you know with these new DVRs the last few years, you can just rewind
[01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:38.660]  what was live. You've probably already seen it. They now have Pillsbury Doughboy ads where
[01:24:38.660 --> 01:24:47.620]  the TSA gropes the Pillsbury Doughboy, and it is a bunch of fun to have this basically
[01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:55.180]  done to him. Again, everything is acclimation. The TV shows, the radio, the mainline radio,
[01:24:55.180 --> 01:25:04.500]  the print stuff. He loves it, too, when he gets scrubbed. Oh, he likes it.
[01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:05.500]  Sir.
[01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:07.540]  I'll get it together. I promise.
[01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:12.500]  Look, the TSA's wearing like a police badge. Oh, going for it.
[01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:18.460]  How many happier folks who save hundreds of dollars switch to Geico?
[01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:23.060]  It's a Geico ad with a Pillsbury Doughboy? So I guess they're doing unified deals now.
[01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:29.060]  I see more and more ads where they, it's like Predator versus Alien. And again, it's the
[01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:39.580]  new sacrament in America to have your junk groped. John is saying that Rockefeller owns
[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:44.100]  Geico. Look into that. Look into the conglomerate that owns it.
[01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:51.940]  By the way, up at infowars.com right now, illegal immigrant DUI killer ruled incompetent
[01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:58.340]  because of his unique cultural background. A self-confessed illegal immigrant in Milford
[01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:04.660]  Mass faces 15 years of found guilty of vehicular homicide. But it's a big if, as it stands
[01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:10.220]  right now, Nicholas D. Gaughman has been found incompetent to stand trial because he doesn't
[01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:14.660]  speak English and doesn't understand the American legal system.
[01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:18.320]  And again, illegal aliens are allowed to drink and drive. They're allowed to, I mean, it's
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:26.100]  on record where sheriffs arrest them and then the prosecutors let them go. Critics say he
[01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:32.640]  had an accomplice, Massachusetts Governor Devel Patrick, Devel Patrick. And it goes
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:40.500]  on to say that, well, he's basically above the law.
[01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:46.800]  By the way, the Travis County prosecutor got arrested while drinking and driving. And she's
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:53.060]  admitted to it up by the entrance to Steiner Ranch out by Lakeway. And I actually know
[01:26:53.060 --> 01:27:01.060]  people that know her. And I mean, she sounds like she's not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
[01:27:01.060 --> 01:27:05.480]  And she's like, I was having an evening. Yeah, I did. Reportedly, according to the witnesses
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:10.500]  that called 911 on her, and then the cops that showed up, she was driving down the wrong
[01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:16.860]  side of the road doing circles in a major highway, bombed out of her brain.
[01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:21.400]  There it is, after drunk driving arrest, Travis County DA apologized and said she'll remain
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:28.660]  in office. And I know people, one of my friends had some guys jump out of a car one time,
[01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:37.460]  pull him to his house, get in his face, because they claimed that he cut him off. He can tell
[01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:38.460]  the story later if he wants.
[01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:40.700]  He didn't say I couldn't tell him, but I'm not gonna say his name, but he's a well-known
[01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:45.860]  guy in Austin. And they jump out, get in his face, he gets back in their face, he's a big
[01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:54.740]  guy, they run off and leave. And then his brother looks like him, and was probably more
[01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:58.800]  well known at the time, because they both had celebrity jobs.
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:05.320]  One's a country music singer, the other a champion rodeo guy. And this prosecutor, even
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:10.860]  when there were witnesses and everything and hey, it's not my brother, it's me, was still
[01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:19.420]  going to prosecute him. And didn't care, reportedly, until they had all these witnesses and everybody
[01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:22.240]  that know this is the person.
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:28.580]  And then they had to drop that anyway, because he hadn't even done anything. And the brother
[01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:34.460]  had to go before the Travis County grand jury and said, I wanna speak to him. And went and
[01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:39.620]  said, this prosecutor is crazy, this is my brother, this is me, this is my house, this
[01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:45.440]  is my truck. My brother wasn't even in town when this happened, and they don't even care,
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:49.900]  and the grand jury, no build.
[01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:54.900]  And again, it's like the Michael Morton case up in Williamson County, it's world famous
[01:28:54.900 --> 01:29:01.140]  now. He stayed in jail 20 something years, his wife killed, bloody bandana outside with
[01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:06.140]  an ex-con killer's blood on it. And the prosecutor asked the state police, let's not do anything
[01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:07.140]  with that.
[01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:14.260]  And it kept the guy in jail, because a decade or so into his sentence, they had all the
[01:29:14.260 --> 01:29:18.220]  DNA sample, had the DNA sample of the guy that had already killed, later had been arrested,
[01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:22.540]  and didn't wanna test it. And then even when the DNA came out that it wasn't him, they
[01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:25.420]  wanted to keep him in jail, a father with no criminal record.
[01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:30.680]  It's like the more innocent you are, the more under the jail, I guess like the devil gives
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:37.780]  them more lumps of sugar in their coffee when they burn innocent people. All right, we'll
[01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:43.660]  be right back. But Warren Buffett owns Geico, yeah, that's what I thought, and that's Rockefeller,
[01:29:43.660 --> 01:29:47.520]  yeah. So Geico teaching you that your children being groped is a good thing. Everybody should
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:48.520]  boycott.
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:53.300]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:34.540]  we're here back every weeknight, 7 o'clock Central with myself hosting the news, Jakari
[01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:44.580]  Jackson, of course, David Knight, Leanne McAdoo, Rob Doo, did I mention John Bounds, so many
[01:33:44.580 --> 01:33:51.980]  others, Darren McBreen, Paul Watson, you name it. By the way, Paul Watson believes he's
[01:33:51.980 --> 01:34:00.500]  discovered the location of Bilderberg 2013 outside London. He lives now in London or
[01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:07.940]  on the edge of London and so he's going to be covering Bilderberg 2013 in June. And who
[01:34:07.940 --> 01:34:14.980]  knows if I will be parachuting into the confab. I mean that figuratively, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:14.980 --> 01:34:19.540]  All right, I said I'd go to your phone calls. Here's some of the news coming up after I
[01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:24.060]  do that, big sis coordinating gun confiscations. I think that's kind of important news. Illegal
[01:34:24.060 --> 01:34:28.180]  immigrant, DUI killer, ruled incompetent because of his unique cultural background.
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:33.420]  They're looking at just releasing him, they're reporting in the local news, saying that everything
[01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:38.560]  wasn't in Spanish in Massachusetts. And so it's that fault. He didn't know he could drink
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:43.980]  three times the legal limit and go kill some people. And when he drunks and drives, he
[01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:47.760]  gets off and when the Travis County prosecutor does, she gets off.
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:51.500]  She sounded so delusional. Can somebody find her on local news? I heard her on 590, our
[01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:57.340]  local affiliate. They were playing club summer, she was going, I had an evening. I mean, let
[01:34:57.340 --> 01:35:01.460]  me tell you folks, I don't drink a lot, but sometimes I'll go out to a party or an event
[01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:04.940]  or a wedding. And it's hard to not drink a couple glasses of wine.
[01:35:04.940 --> 01:35:11.940]  And then I will sit there and eat something, drink coffee and wait. Or find somebody there
[01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:17.060]  and say, hey, take me home, just because they'll take you to jail for one beer in your body
[01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:21.580]  now. If you drink a beer and get pulled over right then, that's over 0.8 or whatever it
[01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:24.060]  is. I've talked to medical doctors about it.
[01:35:24.060 --> 01:35:27.980]  And the bars are right there, everybody knows, everybody's drinking. And it's all selectively
[01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:34.900]  enforced. I'm surprised this Travis County Sheriff's deputy did his job and arrested
[01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:41.580]  this lady. But he'll have a terrible future in his, but I mean, they had to, she was driving
[01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:44.740]  on the wrong side, doing circles in a major highway.
[01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:51.820]  I mean, she's like, I had a little wine. I bet you did, lady. I mean, I bet you did.
[01:35:51.820 --> 01:35:57.900]  I'd have to drink like four bottles of wine to be that drunk. My God, in the interview,
[01:35:57.900 --> 01:36:01.420]  she sounds like she's had a lobotomy. I mean, I have heard it over and over in a local radio.
[01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:06.660]  She's like, I had a little evening myself. You had a little evening. And I mean, I'm
[01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:08.540]  just so sick of these people.
[01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:12.660]  That lady, by the way, lets illegal aliens go every day. But when she gets a good fat,
[01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:18.020]  let me tell you, that whole wealthy area by Steiner Ranch and down in Lakeway with the
[01:36:18.020 --> 01:36:22.700]  $5 million houses, I go over there to see friends sometimes. And I wanna be out of there
[01:36:22.700 --> 01:36:28.220]  by 10, cuz I've been pulled over, hadn't been drinking. I mean, it's like piranhas. Luckily,
[01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:31.540]  you kind of passed that line back there, and I know I didn't.
[01:36:31.540 --> 01:36:37.420]  And I hadn't been drinking. Mind if I search the vehicle? Yeah, I do mind. You're not gonna
[01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:43.240]  establish your fake probable cause. Okay, staring in my car. I mean, good, go arrest
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:48.460]  all your drunk bosses driving down the wrong side of the road. Leave me alone. Okay, leave
[01:36:48.460 --> 01:36:55.260]  me alone, leave me alone. I mean, I saw a well-known cop drinking tequila in a restaurant.
[01:36:55.260 --> 01:37:00.940]  And I looked at him. The guy probably weighed 250 pounds. Waddle out, go to a movie. I went
[01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:05.700]  to the same theater. I watched him get out with his wife two hours later and drive off.
[01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:11.380]  I didn't call the cops on him. Because I'm not a sick freak. I'm like, he probably has
[01:37:11.380 --> 01:37:12.380]  a little alcohol in him.
[01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:16.460]  But I mean, that doesn't do anything to you when you weigh 250 pounds. I watched him drink
[01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:21.060]  a beer and two tequilas, probably all out of his system in two hours. But let me tell
[01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:27.100]  you, most people would have called the cops on him. But my whole issue is I am watching.
[01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:33.660]  Okay, I said I'd go to your phone calls. Man, I tell you, I wanna get your take on everything.
[01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:36.660]  Guys, will you launch my phone system? I noticed at the start of the show it wasn't launched.
[01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:43.460]  And I forgot to launch that. So I'll probably actually need the phone system to take calls.
[01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:51.940]  But 800-259-9231 and we will get you up on air. We should have a flight check, like reboot
[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:58.420]  computer flight check. We actually do have one of those. Okay, call system is turned
[01:37:58.420 --> 01:37:59.420]  on.
[01:37:59.420 --> 01:38:04.100]  That's always important, check. Lights are turned on, check. Toilet paper is on toilet
[01:38:04.100 --> 01:38:10.000]  paper roll, David Rockefeller roll. I don't even know what that joke means at this point.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:17.500]  So that is some of the news there. Okay, we're gonna go to your phone calls right now. Let's
[01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:21.620]  talk to Steven in Florida. You're on the air, Steven, welcome.
[01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:27.940]  Yeah, good afternoon, Alex. I wanted to comment on this video with Mark Dice that you're talking
[01:38:27.940 --> 01:38:32.740]  about. But first of all, I wanted to ask you, you've just done a bunch of interviews with
[01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:37.440]  Steve Pacinek, who is with Delta Force. And I just wonder if you have ever heard from
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:43.220]  him or know yourself of anything about Dan Lear, who was also with Delta Force and his
[01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:45.660]  intel that he's put out on the Internet.
[01:38:45.660 --> 01:38:49.060]  You're talking about the son of the inventor of the Learjet fortune?
[01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:50.460]  Yes, sir.
[01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:56.660]  Yeah, here's the deal. I'm not knocking Lear, who says space aliens and stuff. I can't prove
[01:38:56.660 --> 01:39:06.540]  all that, so I don't go there. Steve Pacinek is even more than who he says he is. And I
[01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:17.140]  mean, he's really an interesting person on so many fronts. And so I mean, he really was
[01:39:17.140 --> 01:39:18.300]  involved with Delta Force.
[01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:23.340]  He really was in the Carter administration. He really was involved with Boykin. I mean,
[01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:27.620]  I know the players. And I can look up news. I mean, you can go do a search on Pacinek
[01:39:27.620 --> 01:39:38.220]  and Black Ops manipulated Reds in Italy to kill Prime Minister. I mean, just all sorts
[01:39:38.220 --> 01:39:39.220]  of stuff.
[01:39:39.220 --> 01:39:43.020]  Of course, Pacinek will never talk about any of that on air. But I mean, Pacinek really
[01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:47.760]  did know Kim Jong Il. He really did know the father. He really did go into North Korea
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:56.140]  last week. I mean, the guy went into North Korea last week. I mean, he's a spy. But he's
[01:39:56.140 --> 01:40:02.260]  the old fashioned spy. And I'm not saying he doesn't even have other motives out there.
[01:40:02.260 --> 01:40:07.500]  But overall, they don't like what he's doing. The CFR has been very threatening to him.
[01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:11.780]  He's saying a lot of stuff is true on the air. So there you go.
[01:40:11.780 --> 01:40:17.300]  The reason I ask is because Lear put forth something, and I agree with the other stuff
[01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:20.940]  about people living on the moon and other planets and stuff. I don't go for that. But
[01:40:20.940 --> 01:40:26.220]  he put something that I thought was very plausible considering the technology that the globalists
[01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:32.980]  have like Bluebeam. And he stated that he knew that the planes that hit the World Trade
[01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:39.100]  Center were actually holographic images. And they were timed from the doomsday plane that
[01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:44.140]  was seen flying overhead at the same time when the explosions took place. I could believe
[01:40:44.140 --> 01:40:49.380]  that that actually occurred. When you look at the video of the planes, it actually kind
[01:40:49.380 --> 01:40:53.860]  of looks like they're being absorbed into the buildings rather than-
[01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:57.620]  Here's the deal. The media always focuses, and I appreciate your call on that, because
[01:40:57.620 --> 01:41:01.860]  that's what they want to debate. They don't want to debate the Carlisle Group meeting
[01:41:01.860 --> 01:41:06.380]  with the Bushes on the morning of 9-11 with the head of the House of Bin Laden. That's
[01:41:06.380 --> 01:41:12.980]  London Guardian AP. They don't want to discuss the hijackers trained at US bases, AP Reuters,
[01:41:12.980 --> 01:41:17.180]  San Jose Mercury News. The head of the base went public and said, Colonel Butler said,
[01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:21.900]  all I know is these guys are US agents. And then there's a cover up, and this is a double
[01:41:21.900 --> 01:41:28.820]  cross. Did they land an aircraft at a NASA base with different tail numbers?
[01:41:28.820 --> 01:41:32.700]  And then load the people off and then take back off that match the other tail numbers?
[01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:37.820]  Yes. Does Operation Northwoods talk about that? Yes. Is Bluebeam real to be able to
[01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:44.040]  project a 5,000 foot King Kong or Jesus or whatever they want in the hologram? Yes. But
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:47.700]  I don't think they're going to go operational. See, I don't think that kids didn't really
[01:41:47.700 --> 01:41:52.560]  die at New Haven. They like killing real kids. They clearly have some actors there to back
[01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:53.980]  up the story as well.
[01:41:53.980 --> 01:41:57.620]  It's a composite. Part of it's real, part of it isn't. That's very obvious. And that's
[01:41:57.620 --> 01:42:01.940]  what the other declassified programs look like. They're going to kill real kids. They're
[01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:06.340]  going to kill real people. Now, was it confirmed the towers are more than half empty that day
[01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:13.020]  what they regularly were? Yes. Was it confirmed that basically most people got the word not
[01:42:13.020 --> 01:42:15.180]  to go to work that day across the board?
[01:42:15.180 --> 01:42:21.340]  Yes. So the media turns it into no Jews died conspiracy theory when there are a bunch of
[01:42:21.340 --> 01:42:26.660]  Jews died in the World Trade Centers. See, it comes out, the buildings were half empty.
[01:42:26.660 --> 01:42:29.780]  There's all these warnings. It's in local news. Yeah, we got warned not to go to work
[01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:31.420]  that day, the day before.
[01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:34.980]  Mayor Willie Brown comes out, San Francisco Chronicle. I got a call from Condoleezza Rice
[01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:44.460]  told me don't fly to New York tomorrow. I mean, that came out September 12th. And then
[01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:49.260]  he got told to shut up and wouldn't talk about it. See, nobody wants to, it said it's like,
[01:42:49.260 --> 01:42:50.260]  oh, Jews.
[01:42:50.260 --> 01:42:54.520]  And people go, you're covering up for the Jews. No, no, the media, when all this came
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:58.300]  out about Willie Brown getting warned and all these other people and Arabs got warned,
[01:42:58.300 --> 01:43:03.900]  that got confirmed. And some companies that did have Jews working out, some Jews got warned.
[01:43:03.900 --> 01:43:09.560]  And all that came out, it's like, Jews. People say no Jews died to create a false conspiracy
[01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:16.420]  theory. And again, I don't know exactly what happened on 9-11, but the official story is
[01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:17.420]  a fraud.
[01:43:17.420 --> 01:43:20.780]  I mean, look at how our government runs Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria now and gave them 10,000
[01:43:20.780 --> 01:43:27.300]  heat seeking missiles on record. And in a year or two years, when European and US or
[01:43:27.300 --> 01:43:31.580]  English jet airliners get shot down by the heat seekers, it'll be buried in the back
[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:35.580]  of the news that our government gave them the heat seekers. And I'll be pointing out
[01:43:35.580 --> 01:43:40.260]  all the reports we did, all the warnings, and it'll be, yeah, Fox News.
[01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:44.500]  Yeah, Alex is that piece of garbage, or Glenn Beck will say, that says our government, our
[01:43:44.500 --> 01:43:50.740]  firefighters did 9-11. That was the talking point a few years ago was Alex says the fire
[01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:56.780]  department was in, I never said that. Alex says Jews did it, I never said that. You see,
[01:43:56.780 --> 01:44:01.100]  I'm like, hey, they gave him 10,000 heat seekers, here's the mainstream articles.
[01:44:01.100 --> 01:44:04.400]  This is terrible, remember this when it comes out, and I'll be here with the mainstream
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:08.380]  articles when it happens. Go and see, I told you it'll be, shut up, you un-American piece
[01:44:08.380 --> 01:44:17.940]  of garbage. I mean, I called Colonel Butler up, called information the day the news hit.
[01:44:17.940 --> 01:44:21.660]  And I said, I'd like you to come on about how Muhammad had a train in your class. He
[01:44:21.660 --> 01:44:24.860]  was the dean of the school and he goes, I can't talk to you, I'm getting threatened.
[01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:28.100]  This, and I heard a woman in the background going, I told you and they told you, what
[01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:34.260]  are you doing? Click, cuz they began the court martial of him the next day. They probably
[01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:37.060]  had men in suits in their house right then.
[01:44:37.060 --> 01:44:41.500]  Imagine the colonel, the head of the base is like five of the hijackers trained. Atta
[01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:47.340]  was in my class, front row, for a year. Something's going on, the government's involved, we gotta
[01:44:47.340 --> 01:44:52.140]  warn people. And I'll bet you bottom dollar, we ought to go try to find Butler, that's
[01:44:52.140 --> 01:44:56.580]  kind of stuff gets you killed, cuz the credibility of that.
[01:44:56.580 --> 01:45:00.940]  And by the way, San Jose Mercury News wasn't controlled. They reported it right after it
[01:45:00.940 --> 01:45:06.380]  happened, was like September 15th or something, wrote a letter to the editor. The head of
[01:45:06.380 --> 01:45:13.460]  the US Embassy in visa section, Springman, tells the Toronto Star, he goes, all I know
[01:45:13.460 --> 01:45:17.980]  is we were told give them visas because the CIA was really controlling them and they weren't
[01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:18.980]  really al-Qaeda.
[01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:23.720]  See, you bring up these points and I said, I'd go to your calls. It's so crazy. Ladies
[01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:28.620]  and gentlemen, crime syndicates. The New World Order is a global banking mafia. They are
[01:45:28.620 --> 01:45:33.700]  a mafia. They have private hit men. These banks are bigger than most countries' GDP.
[01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:37.540]  They have their own armies. They run the private intelligence networks. They can listen to
[01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:38.540]  your phones.
[01:45:38.540 --> 01:45:43.080]  They got 800,000 private contractors with subcontractor companies of the big banks that
[01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:46.780]  listen to your phones. They administer the welfare checks. They run it all, they're the
[01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:52.540]  government. They're dissolving the old government having a new privatized government, not privatized
[01:45:52.540 --> 01:45:58.420]  for bids. These are no bid privatized.
[01:45:58.420 --> 01:46:04.940]  And they are telling the police and military, prepare to arrest Christians in mass. That
[01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:11.420]  broke last week mainstream news. And finally, the normalcy bias of the state police and
[01:46:11.420 --> 01:46:16.560]  sheriffs in Colorado are like, you're teaching us that Christians are terrorists and we're
[01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:22.220]  gonna have to arrest them in mass and there's gonna be a Christian uprising?
[01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:27.940]  That sounds like Russia or something. What is this? Yeah, you better get up off your
[01:46:27.940 --> 01:46:38.680]  butts, folks. The spirit of evil is moving across the country right now. Yeah, that's
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:39.680]  Fox News, guys.
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:44.080]  Pull up the one from Enfold Wars that links to the newspapers in Colorado. The headline
[01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:51.360]  was state police trained to confiscate guns from Christians. Cuz that's got the letters
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:55.140]  from the state police and others just freaking out going, what planet do we live on?
[01:46:55.140 --> 01:47:01.820]  Well, I'll tell you, you live in authoritarianism. And again, I'm freaking out. I'm not even
[01:47:01.820 --> 01:47:06.140]  having an anxiety attack right now. I just feel like I shouldn't even in a weird way
[01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:11.060]  even be on air. I mean, I just can't even believe this anymore. That illegal aliens
[01:47:11.060 --> 01:47:13.860]  are allowed to drink and drive and kill people.
[01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:18.060]  And there it is, DHS funded course, ask cops and they will confiscate guns from Christians.
[01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:22.260]  Colorado troopers trained to consider Christians as dangerous terrorists. I mean, now that
[01:47:22.260 --> 01:47:26.060]  came out on April 10th last week, print that for me, thanks. And it just comes out, it's
[01:47:26.060 --> 01:47:30.260]  like, yeah, and it's got the letters from the state police and people going, yeah, this
[01:47:30.260 --> 01:47:32.620]  is really creepy.
[01:47:32.620 --> 01:47:43.420]  God help me. And I'm telling you, the enemy is gonna come after us however they can. It's
[01:47:43.420 --> 01:47:48.340]  by the grace of God, your prayers were even on the air right now. I mean, I just hope
[01:47:48.340 --> 01:47:53.460]  you know, folks, I am directly at the gate of the dragon's den with a sword stabbing
[01:47:53.460 --> 01:47:55.060]  him in the belly right now, okay?
[01:47:55.060 --> 01:48:01.620]  And I'm little and I'm weak, but the idea is powerful. And my flesh isn't even afraid.
[01:48:01.620 --> 01:48:06.460]  It's more like, I mean, I can't even believe we're in this situation. I can't believe everybody
[01:48:06.460 --> 01:48:14.340]  else is just going around like it's normal. Every instinct I've got is just get my family
[01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:17.300]  and get the hell out of here right now.
[01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:22.100]  But I'm telling you, folks, that way is destruction. We've gotten in this position by, I'm not
[01:48:22.100 --> 01:48:28.360]  gonna say anything. What will my neighbors think? I'm not gonna get involved. Let's talk
[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:32.500]  to David in Pennsylvania. Thanks for holding, David. Don't go to Danny, Ramon, William and
[01:48:32.500 --> 01:48:33.500]  others.
[01:48:33.500 --> 01:48:38.780]  David, welcome. Hey, Alex, how are you? I just am watching the fall of America. It's
[01:48:38.780 --> 01:48:40.980]  like a Twilight Zone episode.
[01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:45.740]  I hear you, I hear you. I started listening to you three years ago. And when I started
[01:48:45.740 --> 01:48:50.700]  telling my neighbors and people about what you said, you know, they would think I was
[01:48:50.700 --> 01:48:57.740]  crazy, a lunatic. But what's strange is a lot of people agree now that nobody seems
[01:48:57.740 --> 01:49:05.660]  to want to do anything. I mean, I called my senator and I even called Martinez down there
[01:49:05.660 --> 01:49:07.820]  when I saw that video on your website.
[01:49:07.820 --> 01:49:15.020]  But what do we do? He's the Bloomberg Point guy here in Austin, Mayor Pro Tem. And it's
[01:49:15.020 --> 01:49:22.000]  just the way he smiles at those good, decent, you know, look like heroes, those pro gun
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:26.020]  guys that were there. Just look you in the eye, smart, look manly, just obviously good
[01:49:26.020 --> 01:49:30.700]  guys got signs saying, you know, no to gun ban and they assault them and the cops act
[01:49:30.700 --> 01:49:31.700]  like they're bad.
[01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:35.420]  And then Martinez laughs at them and says, we're going to register your guns and then
[01:49:35.420 --> 01:49:36.740]  we're going to take them. And just-
[01:49:36.740 --> 01:49:39.740]  Austin City Council member, Hank Martinez.
[01:49:39.740 --> 01:49:48.740]  Thank you so much. I've got a proclamation on the African American City Council that
[01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:53.740]  we want to present, but I want to say a couple of words and I'll be brief. First of all,
[01:49:53.740 --> 01:49:57.940]  ladies and gentlemen, it's time for attention. Someone needs to inform them that there is
[01:49:57.940 --> 01:50:04.940]  no gun ban currently. But because of the work that we're doing here today, we will make
[01:50:04.940 --> 01:50:11.500]  your side legitimate shortly. So you hold on to that.
[01:50:11.500 --> 01:50:19.260]  And again, they cheer and while this is happening, a woman comes up and hits him with her, not
[01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:25.900]  a complete fish. She had like, you know, her knuckles. It's almost like a monkey hits people,
[01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:26.900]  a chimpanzee.
[01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:31.260]  She throws her hand out and hits him with the middle of her fingers. And you could tell
[01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:35.900]  he pops him and she pops him pretty hard. He turns around and another guy runs in. They're
[01:50:35.900 --> 01:50:40.220]  like roaches. I mean, Martinez says that you want some attention, buddy? And they just
[01:50:40.220 --> 01:50:44.320]  run in like roaches. I'm going to come back to you, call her. I'm going to come back.
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:47.300]  Don't hang up, David. I want to hear what you have to say. And again, it's just there's
[01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:52.420]  such flaming authoritarians and Martinez, if you don't see the video as a radio listener,
[01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:58.620]  it's on info wars dot com. There's this craziness, this will get your guns because he sees us

[01:52:00.700 --> 01:52:04.340]  Breaking news. Harry Reid and the Democrats in the Senate are getting ready to pass a
[01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:08.420]  sweeping new gun control bill that will take away your constitutional right to keep and
[01:52:08.420 --> 01:52:13.140]  bear arms. Conservatives in the Senate led by Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Marco
[01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:17.040]  Rubio have promised to do everything they can to keep this dangerous bill from becoming
[01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:21.480]  law even if they have to filibuster it day and night. These principled leaders refuse
[01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:25.720]  to compromise with President Obama. They have committed to fight the gun grabbing liberals
[01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:30.220]  in the Senate but they need your help to succeed. You can support them by calling today. Please

[01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:44.180]  using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish
[01:53:44.180 --> 01:53:51.680]  the skin while delivering the silver more effectively. Visit www.silverlungs.com and

[01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:12.180]  All right, Richard Belzer who's got a new book out. Just finished that we also sell
[01:54:12.180 --> 01:54:17.940]  at info-war-store.com, Hit List, an in-depth investigation into the mysterious deaths of
[01:54:17.940 --> 01:54:22.280]  witnesses to the JFK assassination. This is the most compelling evidence, cuz you can
[01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:25.620]  make up stuff about magic bullets and stuff with ignorant people.
[01:54:25.620 --> 01:54:31.160]  But what about all the people that were murdered? It's hundreds of them, more than 50 where
[01:54:31.160 --> 01:54:39.040]  it's just incredibly obvious. I mean within weeks murdered to keep the official story
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:44.780]  floating for a while. So that's gonna be coming up in about the eight after we're gonna take
[01:54:44.780 --> 01:54:49.880]  calls right now. David, finish your point. I'm sorry, we went to that clip of the gun
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:53.720]  grabber saying after we're registered, the work they're doing now, that you'll need your
[01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:55.080]  sign, don't ban the gun.
[01:54:55.080 --> 01:55:00.420]  So keep that sign, you're gonna need that. I mean, it's just incredible how disingenuous
[01:55:00.420 --> 01:55:04.320]  most of them are. At least he was honest about the fact that he'll have armed guards, but
[01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:10.320]  he won't. That's how they roll. But go ahead, David, make your point from Pennsylvania.
[01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:16.120]  Well, the point I was trying to make is since they always turn it around on us, I mean,
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:22.160]  how do we ultimately win? I mean, we keep talking and talking. And I agree with you,
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:28.960]  the one who takes the first shot loses, but at the end, how do we turn this around?
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:32.740]  Well number one, they're gonna stage stuff and say we took the first shot. They'll find
[01:55:32.740 --> 01:55:35.980]  a federal building with a daycare again and blow it up. There's no doubt that was a federal
[01:55:35.980 --> 01:55:41.920]  operation. I'm in the film and I endorse it, very powerful. It's got police officers that
[01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:45.960]  were witnesses to the government operation who were death-threaded, living cops, not
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:48.200]  the cops they were able to kill, like Terrence Yakey.
[01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:53.120]  They got Mr. Browning, Don Browning, and others in there. And imagine the head of the K-9
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:57.460]  unit, a Marine veteran of Vietnam, and he's told we're gonna kill you and your wife if
[01:55:57.460 --> 01:56:01.480]  you don't shut up about what you saw, boy. One of the first guys to show up, how's that
[01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:02.480]  sound?
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:06.680]  I mean, you're right, we blew that up, buddy. Now you keep your mouth shut or you're dead.
[01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:10.520]  And by the way, when I got him to talk about that first on radio and then in that film,
[01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:16.840]  he was gulping on air when he did it. Because even a combat veteran is like, okay, because
[01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:19.740]  he cares about the truth and those kids they killed.
[01:56:19.740 --> 01:56:24.560]  You think it's fun doing this, folks? You think it's fun? All the egomaniacs and narcissists
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:28.720]  out there that think they're patriots, who all they do is infight and stuff all day.
[01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:34.880]  This is a life and death situation. This isn't a game. And they're gonna fire first by blowing
[01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:38.720]  stuff up and saying we did it. That's why we gotta expose who really does the fought
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:39.960]  fast and furious.
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:44.300]  And of course they did Aurora, and of course they're up to their eyeballs. I mean, shooters
[01:56:44.300 --> 01:56:50.680]  in the same outfit from nearby hostage team, SWAT teams, from nearby federal special unit,
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:55.640]  local police who were federal special event police caught in the woods. It wasn't just
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:59.680]  one, it wasn't just two, there were three of them seen, one of them arrested.
[01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:03.760]  And then they tried to cover it up and say it didn't exist, even though it was confirmed
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:09.520]  in the police reports and we have chopper video. Okay, I mean, we're in trouble, folks.
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:14.680]  They grease little kids, boom, right in the head to get our guns. Isn't it obvious? I'm
[01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:16.680]  sorry, sir, go ahead.
[01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:26.040]  Yeah, you're right, it's unbelievable. But I'll stay in Washington again, my friend.
[01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:27.200]  But you say, listen, you say locals that were laughing at you, they're not laughing anymore.
[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:30.400]  Well, listen, when they nuke a city or blow up a federal building and blame it on us,
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:34.360]  your neighbors are really gonna listen if you've told them and given them a noble lie,
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:39.640]  film at info war store.com. Get that film, show it to your neighbors so they understand,
[01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:40.640]  okay?
[01:57:40.640 --> 01:57:41.640]  Yes, sir, thank you.
[01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:47.120]  Thank you, and imagine a veteran cop, Marine Corps veteran, combat veteran, he's on my
[01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:51.640]  show. I'm like, all right, the film's coming out. And you talk about how the FBI came to
[01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:57.360]  your office and said you and your wife would be killed if you didn't shut up. And he goes,
[01:57:57.360 --> 01:58:01.160]  and he tells the story and I go, okay, go ahead and tell me the names.
[01:58:01.160 --> 01:58:06.600]  Listen, there is a God and I'm in God's hands. You understand that? And that's why everyone
[01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:11.580]  marvels at this show. No one can believe we're on the air. No one can believe this is happening.
[01:58:11.580 --> 01:58:18.440]  How could Alex be real? Because it's impossible, because people can't handle their own fear.
[01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:23.800]  Other media people can't handle their own fear. You understand, they can't imagine,
[01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:28.280]  there are good police, there are good military, there are good people in media.
[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:33.880]  And it shows there's still good people in America that we're on over 150 AM and FM affiliates.
[01:58:33.880 --> 01:58:38.360]  Okay, we can turn the tide, folks, but this is the most hardcore tyranny the world's ever
[01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:47.080]  seen. We've got to fight it. You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:56.160]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty good
[01:58:56.160 --> 01:59:01.360]  sized meal, that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well-known fact that most
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:05.440]  of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized
[01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:11.720]  world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that
[01:59:11.720 --> 01:59:17.400]  our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be healthy. I then searched out the
[01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:23.400]  best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity. The Young Jevity products

[02:00:34.680 --> 02:00:39.600]  up. If we give in to the bullies, they're going to take everything. The only chance is fighting

[02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:49.680]  because that can bring them down. Let's talk to Danny and Tennessee. You're on the air. Danny,
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:56.960]  welcome. Can you hear me okay? Alex? Yes, Danny. Hey, brother, man. I was wanting to talk to you
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:01:03.440]  about what Billy Corgan had suggested to you, which you already have done it, but he was talking
[02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:10.200]  to you about that you need to get in touch with people that had ancestors that had been able to
[02:01:10.200 --> 02:01:15.040]  survive for the past few thousand years about like the Native Americans. Well, my ancestors
[02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:19.120]  have survived pretty darn good and founded countries and Texas and you name it. And I do
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:24.120]  agree. I want to get other groups and people on with their perspective. And that's the way to
[02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:28.400]  reach out. And that's what I'm trying to do with my message across the political spectrum. Yes, sir.
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:33.480]  Yes. Some of my ancestors were from Scotland. They were Jacob. I don't know if you know what that is.
[02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:39.120]  Yes, I do. Okay. Well, what I was going to say was, oh, you had already done all this stuff with
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:46.200]  Russell Means. You had already had the documentary that you had with Welcome to the Reservation and
[02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:52.040]  all that you had had John Trudell on before. But what I was going to suggest to you was, Alex,
[02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:56.200]  was just like what you were standing up for a break, where it was like kind of like a spiritual,
[02:01:56.200 --> 02:01:59.520]  you're saying like spiritually, you know, it's like real heavy.
[02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:06.000]  I mean, that's it. I can feel not just see it manifesting evil, like rushing out and like
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:11.480]  possessing people. Almost people are getting crazier, meaner, more backstabbing, more like
[02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:16.520]  delusional where people make up whatever they want to believe. I mean, it's just I mean,
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:22.040]  it freaks me out. I see it on the highways. I'm sure everybody I talk to is seeing it.
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:27.400]  Are you saying that? Definitely, Alex, definitely. But what I was going to say was when you was
[02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:31.000]  talking to Billy, you was talking about like going up to that next mountaintop and how like
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:34.520]  you're kind of like screaming into the side of the mountain right now with like your broadcast,
[02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:40.240]  like, you know, not a lot of people are awake and can understand and hear. But if you recall back
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:44.520]  to that first interview with Russell Means and anyone that's listening right now, you can you
[02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:48.800]  can go to Alex Jones YouTube channel, listen to this. He has a playlist with Russell Means. Alex,
[02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:53.040]  do you remember like how awesome that first interview was with Russell Means? Like how
[02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:57.600]  much you had in common? Yeah, no, no, no. How the whole left hand writer controlled how it's what
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:03.360]  Obama was going to do. It's like four years ago. And absolutely, people say Russell Means, he's the
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:08.560]  big anti, you know, whatever. He's a guy that really grew a lot of courage with the big sieges
[02:03:08.560 --> 02:03:12.800]  that wounded neither the rest of it. He was demonized by the Native American groups because
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:18.080]  they were coming tell bro and jealous of him, basically. And I mean, nobody's perfect, but
[02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:21.600]  I mean, I've talked a lot with Russell Means on and off the air. We went to the Dakotas to
[02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:26.560]  interview him, and he was the real deal. And he's dead now, but his information lives on.
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:32.720]  And he grew a lot and became a constitutionalist and libertarian and really transcended,
[02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:39.840]  you know, kind of the fake leftism. But that's why they tried to cover all that up and assassinate
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:44.960]  his name. And if they kill me, folks, that's the first thing they'll do is either try to
[02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:50.960]  assassinate my character first, then kill me or imprison me or kill me and then assassinate
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:54.800]  my character. Because, you know, money, you can get people to say anything you want.
[02:03:54.800 --> 02:03:58.960]  And it doesn't matter. Just remember, you're good. You know what's good. You know the truth.
[02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:04.160]  You are a good person. Stand up and fight tyranny. Don't let them trick you into infighting.
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:10.240]  And also, and I just God has hit me probably being convicted because I've always, you know,
[02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:14.480]  taken the high road with stuff. But sometimes I get a little nasty like Glenn Beck and stuff
[02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:21.120]  and other things. I have just decided and totally been convicted. And for people that don't know
[02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:26.400]  that, you know, that means like by God, not like convicted like of a crime that I need to just
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:32.480]  absolutely turn it all loose and also redouble my efforts, but also just completely trust in God
[02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:39.440]  and transcend all of the narcissism, all of the ego, all of it, because we need to all realize
[02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:44.960]  how real all this is. I mean, this is so real, folks. And we're as bad as things are, we're on
[02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:53.120]  the edge of just a cauldron of psychopaths and sociopaths and control freaks and weirdos that
[02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:57.760]  want to run rampant in society. We'll be right back with more calls on our guest. Stay with us.

[02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:19.360]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:33.680]  Well, he's been in scores of different TV shows and movies, probably best known for law and order
[02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:38.960]  special victims unit Richard Belzer. And I like getting him on because he's a funny guy. Plus,
[02:08:38.960 --> 02:08:43.960]  you know, who else shows up to the show with Christopher Walken before it's like here's
[02:08:43.960 --> 02:08:48.760]  Christopher Walken and then he sits down right next to him off the chart. But Walken just wanted
[02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:55.400]  to talk about recipes, chicken recipes. And we're carrying his new book, which I think
[02:08:56.120 --> 02:09:01.240]  one of the best JFK books out there. It just came out. It's available at info war store.com.
[02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:04.760]  But the reason I think it's important is I've told people if we make a JFK film,
[02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:08.280]  which I've been doing for eight years with footage, you kind of get obsessed with it
[02:09:08.280 --> 02:09:12.520]  when you work on it and then never put out the final product. This is just so many
[02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:16.680]  things to cover so much proof, debunking the debunkers. It's ridiculous.
[02:09:16.680 --> 02:09:23.720]  But the biggest smoking gun is the hundreds of people murdered, tortured, killed, you name it,
[02:09:23.720 --> 02:09:29.800]  who were witnesses or were connected to the JFK assassination. That's the real proof. You see,
[02:09:29.800 --> 02:09:33.640]  it's like the gun control thing. You could hear the argument for background checks,
[02:09:33.640 --> 02:09:37.320]  the argument for mentally ill people. The problem is the government wants the guns to control us.
[02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:42.520]  They're buying billions of rounds of ammo. They're buying armored vehicles. That's the issue.
[02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:45.480]  You know, Dianne Feinstein laughs and says, yeah, of course I'm gonna take the guns after
[02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:49.160]  we register them. Mike Martinez in Austin, the city council says, yeah, we're gonna register
[02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:53.400]  then confiscate. You go out and talk to Californians on the street, we've got the video.
[02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:57.880]  It's up at info wars.com right now. They say, yeah, we need to arrest gun owners.
[02:09:58.520 --> 02:10:02.200]  I mean, it's just this demonization like we killed the kids at Sandy Hook.
[02:10:02.840 --> 02:10:05.720]  My whole point is if you have a military industrial complex,
[02:10:05.720 --> 02:10:08.040]  the second amendment is the check and the balance on that.
[02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:14.760]  That's my point. And I get real liberals who are like anti-war. I get not wanting
[02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:18.600]  to kill things. I even used to be a big hunter. And I think if you butcher it and actually eat
[02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:22.360]  it, it's good, but I don't just like to kill things. But I also think it's more humane to
[02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:26.680]  go get a hamburger you just eat and then criticize somebody who actually goes out and butchers the
[02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:31.240]  cow themselves. They tried to shut down Discovery Channel shows where it shows like Amish and people
[02:10:31.240 --> 02:10:35.240]  that actually raise their own cattle and butcher them and everything. It's like, that's so mean
[02:10:35.240 --> 02:10:40.200]  they killed the cow. Well, it's ten times more humane than how they kill them at slaughterhouses.
[02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:47.320]  My point is, is that people say, you're liberal, you're anti-GMO. No, all the major GMO crops that
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:52.280]  are cross species and have grow their own pesticide absolutely kill the rodents it's fed to.
[02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:57.720]  And you look at what's happening to us. I'm pro common sense. But I didn't get
[02:10:57.720 --> 02:11:01.240]  belzer on about gun stuff because I know he's in the kind of the middle of the road on that.
[02:11:01.960 --> 02:11:06.360]  It's just all this stuff's happening up at prison planet.com and infowars.com right now.
[02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:11.160]  Californian signs petition to ban and confiscate firearms. I keep harping on that because it
[02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:14.040]  people need to know they're gonna take all the guns they have everywhere else.
[02:11:14.040 --> 02:11:19.240]  Let's be honest about it. Obama supports supporters of competition to ban free speech.
[02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:23.880]  A new article out with video of that happening. Obama supporters sign petition
[02:11:23.880 --> 02:11:28.760]  to ban free speech. Illegal immigrant DUI killer ruled incompetent
[02:11:28.760 --> 02:11:34.360]  because his unique cultural background. Republicans support gun bill as Senator
[02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:40.680]  Warren's of loopholes. US backed FAS rebels decapitate and grill victim.
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:44.680]  I'm not kidding. The UN always does that too. Type in UN grilling children. You'll get the
[02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:49.880]  photos in newspapers. I'm not joking. Hacked photo show Colin Pallet Bohemian Grove.
[02:11:50.760 --> 02:11:54.120]  Big sis coordinating gun confiscations. That's confirmed.
[02:11:54.680 --> 02:11:58.440]  She's the one ordering the persecution of the vets. I mean, like their Jews in Nazi
[02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:01.800]  Germany, folks, when they go after a group, you know you're in danger.
[02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:07.880]  I'm gonna get into all that with Belzer and I promise William and Ramon and Chad and Nick and
[02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:12.760]  Brendan all you were holding, but he can talk about any subject. We're not JFK for the first
[02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:17.560]  20 minutes or so. Hit list an in-depth investigation into the mysterious deaths
[02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:23.640]  of witnesses to the JFK assassination available at info war store.com.
[02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:27.560]  It's just coming out. His last book on JFK became a New York Times bestseller.
[02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:31.880]  It isn't about even the money with this. I mean, obviously, buying it from us funds
[02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:36.440]  our operation, but books are a very small part of it. It's about having a tool to wake people up.
[02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:41.080]  And again, this is my pet project. I didn't even tell Belzer this.
[02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:48.040]  I think and I've told people privately and on air that I believe the murders of the witnesses
[02:12:48.040 --> 02:12:56.040]  is the key. And a lot of JFK researchers also know that, but this book is extremely hard hitting
[02:12:56.040 --> 02:13:01.720]  and extremely well documented. It's my favorite type of read with like factoid data pages,
[02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:08.680]  every other page, showing what the globalist are doing, how they demonized
[02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:15.960]  people that spoke out, how they killed them, just neurotically documenting everything,
[02:13:15.960 --> 02:13:20.360]  the people that were killed, all of it. So they also assassinated people's character.
[02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:24.040]  They didn't just kill people physically. And so joining us to talk about
[02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:28.440]  Richard Belzer with David Wain hit list, an in-depth investigation into the mysterious
[02:13:28.440 --> 02:13:34.360]  deaths of witnesses to the JFK assassination. He joins us now via video Skype. And good to
[02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:38.280]  have you back on with us, Richard. Alex, it's great. I miss you. I haven't
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:45.960]  spoken to you in a long time. I must say that your programming, your documentaries, your news
[02:13:46.680 --> 02:13:52.920]  shows, those interviews have helped me in my research and I greatly appreciate it.
[02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:57.160]  And I want you to always take care of yourself and stay safe, my friend, because we're,
[02:13:57.720 --> 02:14:03.880]  as you say, we're trading in some dangerous waters now because a former FBI agent who I interviewed,
[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:08.920]  I won't name him, but he said, I have no theories. I just have facts. And that's why
[02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:14.760]  I'm so proud of the last two books I did because I used to be a journalist. I've written novels and
[02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:19.640]  you know, I'm a comedian. I'm an actor. I'm obsessed with the recent history of our country,
[02:14:19.640 --> 02:14:24.520]  at least since World War One and what has happened. And I just want to read one quick
[02:14:24.520 --> 02:14:29.720]  thing, if I may, Alex. History will not absolve us if we do not once and for all
[02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:35.000]  reveal all that is known about the greatest, most tragic murder mystery in American history.
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:39.160]  After all, 90% of the American people believe that there was a conspiracy to assassinate John
[02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:45.400]  F. Kennedy. The other 10% work for the government or the media. This book is dedicated to the 90%.
[02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:51.960]  May you forever question, hold accountable and improve the great gift from our forebearers,
[02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:57.400]  what historians have called our experiment in democracy. Let us all join in this quest
[02:14:57.400 --> 02:15:03.800]  to preserve the very soul of our nation. And I think, Alex, you are in this small brigade.
[02:15:03.800 --> 02:15:08.440]  I hope it's getting bigger of just, I know you don't make anything up. It's the truth.
[02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:12.840]  You know, that's why I don't write fiction anymore. Well, Richard, it's great having
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:21.480]  you with us. And when I talk about the fact that this is dangerous, it's still dangerous for JFK
[02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:25.720]  investigators and it's dangerous for journalists that talk to whistleblowers.
[02:15:25.720 --> 02:15:30.360]  They're now arresting journalists, as you know, at record levels, government people
[02:15:30.360 --> 02:15:34.120]  that report crimes are being arrested. This is a-
[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:40.760]  Yeah, there's a documentary coming out, I think this week, Alex, about Obama and how he is going
[02:15:40.760 --> 02:15:49.640]  after whistleblowers in a really astounding way. And boy, you know, this administration is really
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:57.640]  scary. I remember the unicorns and the rainbows when he came in and I'm glad that we elected a
[02:15:57.640 --> 02:16:04.520]  mixed race person, but he brought in all the bad bankers. I wrote a piece in Huffington Post six
[02:16:04.520 --> 02:16:10.760]  years ago called It's the Banks, Stupid. And I talked about reverse bank robbery. They're
[02:16:10.760 --> 02:16:14.200]  robbing us. We're not robbing them. You know, in the old days, Dillinger during the Depression
[02:16:14.200 --> 02:16:19.560]  would rob a bank. He was a hero. Now they rob us. And you're right to keep going back to the
[02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:23.240]  banks, Alex. And I want to tell you something that was pretty chilling today. I was listening
[02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:30.360]  to your show online and someone was talking about you're getting into the banks and all of a sudden,
[02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:35.560]  beep, beep, beep, beep. This station is not available. Try again later. Now, you know,
[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:43.960]  people call me paranoid. And then for the last few days, my computer, the cursor is
[02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:49.480]  going to places by itself. And- Oh, yeah, your computer's been hijacked.
[02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:55.240]  Yeah, I'm hip. So, you know, that's why my friend Chris Walken, he doesn't have a computer. He
[02:16:55.240 --> 02:17:00.520]  doesn't have a phone. He's not on any Google map. Now I'm realizing how smart he is.
[02:17:01.240 --> 02:17:05.720]  By the way, I'm seriously discussing with my wife getting computers completely out of the house
[02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:12.440]  only coming into work to use them. Yeah, that's a good idea. At the very least,
[02:17:12.440 --> 02:17:16.280]  tape the camera on your computer. Always keep that taped.
[02:17:17.320 --> 02:17:20.840]  Oh, yeah, they used to call a conspiracy theorist 10 years ago about that. Now they just
[02:17:20.840 --> 02:17:25.640]  admit it. You're absolutely right. Why do you think the corruption is just getting so out of
[02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:30.120]  control even compared to what it was? Or is it that we just know about the corruption now?
[02:17:30.120 --> 02:17:38.760]  No, I think it's a sinking ship and the rats are panicking. They have had mass mind control on us.
[02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:44.120]  They lied us into World War I and every war thereafter. Germany didn't lose World War II.
[02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:48.200]  They just changed their headquarters from Berlin to Washington. The Dulles brothers helped the
[02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:57.080]  Harrimans, the Bushes, Jack Kennedy's father, every rich family. When Teddy Roosevelt had all
[02:17:57.080 --> 02:18:03.320]  this antitrust stuff going on, all the richest families in America all put their money in Germany
[02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:09.960]  in the 20s in part causing our depression because they thought, hey, they're union crushing and you
[02:18:09.960 --> 02:18:15.080]  can have monopolies. Then Hitler came in and they still supported Hitler, but then he got a little
[02:18:15.080 --> 02:18:20.040]  out of hand, so they had to really go in. But you know, we didn't declare war on Germany. He declared
[02:18:20.040 --> 02:18:26.760]  war on us. Hitler was standing in Paris in 1940. We still were not at war with them. It's very,
[02:18:26.760 --> 02:18:31.720]  you know. No, that's right. When Japan declared war on us, he had a treaty and he declared war on
[02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:39.480]  us. Yeah. And he didn't even, he wasn't even, that was really an, it's chilling to think if he
[02:18:39.480 --> 02:18:45.160]  didn't, how far he would have gotten because General Motors was building trucks for him
[02:18:45.160 --> 02:18:50.520]  throughout the war. Standard Oil was helping him throughout the war. No, that's why he's so arrogant
[02:18:50.520 --> 02:18:56.760]  or was so arrogant. And that's what people don't know. In 1939, they had Time Magazine saying what
[02:18:56.760 --> 02:19:02.040]  a great man he was. My grandfather growing up in Dallas, they used to translate on the major
[02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:08.280]  Dallas station's Hitler speeches like the president was speaking when he grew up. Oh yeah. When he
[02:19:08.280 --> 02:19:14.840]  when he grew up in the mid thirties in Dallas, Hitler was like a celebrity. That is astounding.
[02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:20.920]  Wow. But I'm not surprised. You know, I'm shocked, but I'm not surprised. No, Alan
[02:19:20.920 --> 02:19:26.840]  Dulles and his brother, John Foster Dulles, they were, they started their careers at the
[02:19:26.840 --> 02:19:34.360]  Treaty of Versailles when they chopped up Germany into 18 different places and broke up, you know,
[02:19:34.360 --> 02:19:39.320]  regions that were normally were together, just setting the stage for World War II.
[02:19:39.320 --> 02:19:43.720]  That treaty, I mean, I'm not a fan of the Nazis. None of us are. No, no, absolutely. But it shows
[02:19:43.720 --> 02:19:47.960]  there's a larger hand above it all playing us off against each other. Richard Belzer, stay there.
[02:19:47.960 --> 02:19:52.680]  I want to get into the book and some of the killings of witnesses. I mean, why are these
[02:19:52.680 --> 02:19:56.840]  people getting killed that were witnesses if there's nothing to cover up? I mean, it's amazing.
[02:19:56.840 --> 02:19:59.880]  We'll be right back with Richard Belzer. Get the book at M4 store.com.
[02:19:59.880 --> 02:20:06.840]  Hey there, my name is Frank Bates. Do you know the number one most valuable item in a crisis?
[02:20:06.840 --> 02:20:12.040]  Some people think the answer is gold. Others think it's a gun. But the correct answer will
[02:20:12.040 --> 02:20:18.600]  shock you. I just created a free video at crisis123.com that reveals a surprising item
[02:20:18.600 --> 02:20:25.240]  that is more valuable than gold in a crisis. 97% of Americans don't have this one critical item.
[02:20:25.240 --> 02:20:30.040]  In fact, they haven't even given it a thought. And the sad truth is that you may not survive
[02:20:30.040 --> 02:20:34.840]  without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside your door.
[02:20:34.840 --> 02:20:38.360]  But I have to tell you could literally make the difference between life and death
[02:20:38.360 --> 02:20:42.760]  for you and your family. Watch my video at crisis123.com
[02:20:42.760 --> 02:20:48.520]  to discover the number one most valuable item in a crisis. You'll be shocked. See the controversial
[02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:52.600]  video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[02:20:52.600 --> 02:20:58.040]  Go watch my video now at crisis123.com before they forced me to shut it down.
[02:20:58.040 --> 02:21:00.600]  Again, that's crisis123.com.

[02:21:30.200 --> 02:21:34.520]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors
[02:21:34.520 --> 02:21:39.640]  won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't
[02:21:39.640 --> 02:21:44.440]  recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no
[02:21:44.440 --> 02:21:50.920]  word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237. Don't get
[02:21:50.920 --> 02:21:57.640]  left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237. Secure your future and call
[02:21:57.640 --> 02:22:04.760]  1-800-686-2237. In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:22:04.760 --> 02:22:10.520]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone. In
[02:22:10.520 --> 02:22:15.800]  2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight,
[02:22:15.800 --> 02:22:20.760]  out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is, you are. We all are.
[02:22:20.760 --> 02:22:25.480]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature,
[02:22:25.480 --> 02:22:30.760]  but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply

[02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:24.600]  This is from the Groove Tube, a movie that Richard Belzer starred in. I bet you recognize
[02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:31.000]  that music, Richard. Actually, that was my first film. That's very hippie or programmer there.
[02:24:33.080 --> 02:24:36.360]  Again, you've got the new book out. I want to get into a bunch of world issues with you.
[02:24:36.360 --> 02:24:41.880]  Attack on Iran may trigger World War III. Iranian Envoy is saying that's up at Infowars.com,
[02:24:41.880 --> 02:24:46.760]  directly from Press TV, the official Iranian news agency. The word I'm getting from high-level
[02:24:46.760 --> 02:24:53.560]  sources is that now North Korea is the diversion for a strike on Iran. So things are heating up
[02:24:53.560 --> 02:24:57.960]  quickly. Let's get into the book though, because you profile a bunch of the people that were
[02:24:57.960 --> 02:25:02.840]  murdered to cover up what they knew about JFK. Let's talk about Hit List, your new book.
[02:25:02.840 --> 02:25:08.040]  Sure. We got it down to 50. There are some researchers that go as high as 300,
[02:25:08.040 --> 02:25:12.360]  but you have to account, some people are just going to die that were involved in the murder.
[02:25:12.360 --> 02:25:18.600]  So we try to narrow it down. And as you know, I'm glad you like the style of our book because
[02:25:18.600 --> 02:25:22.680]  we tell you what the official verdict is, then we tell you the actual circumstances,
[02:25:22.680 --> 02:25:27.800]  then the inconsistencies. It's heavily footnoted. You show photos, documents,
[02:25:27.800 --> 02:25:32.120]  admissions. You're not just saying this is your opinion. It's almost like a court case.
[02:25:32.120 --> 02:25:35.560]  Yeah, this is in the history section, which I'm very proud of, as was my last book.
[02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:47.320]  It's not fiction or to be taken lightly. The list has on it, Officer Tippett, Oswald Ruby,
[02:25:47.320 --> 02:25:53.000]  Zangretti. There's even one on here who was thought to be involved, but wasn't.
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:26:01.560]  So we straighten that out. That was Karen Kopcina. But if there's any particular one you want,
[02:26:01.560 --> 02:26:06.840]  some of them were people that predicted, don't believe it if you hear I commit suicide.
[02:26:06.840 --> 02:26:13.000]  People had their right side of their head shot and the guns in their hand, they're left-handed.
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:17.400]  People die of karate chops, one car accidents, electrocution.
[02:26:17.400 --> 02:26:20.520]  Yeah, no, it's like Gary Webb saying they're breaking in my house. They're threatening to
[02:26:20.520 --> 02:26:24.200]  kill me. My new book's coming out. I'll never commit suicide. He shoots himself
[02:26:24.200 --> 02:26:27.400]  twice in the head and the police instantly say it's suicide.
[02:26:28.680 --> 02:26:37.880]  I know Gary Webb and Danny Casolaro, people that get really close, you know, it's frightening.
[02:26:37.880 --> 02:26:44.040]  But you know what's interesting is because of the Internet, 1984 goes both ways now. So
[02:26:44.040 --> 02:26:48.040]  they may be watching us, but we're certainly watching them too.
[02:26:48.040 --> 02:26:51.480]  You also cover what they did to Oswald and that he was CIA.
[02:26:53.240 --> 02:26:57.880]  I mean, right there, they executed him on TV to cover it up. I mean, boom.
[02:26:57.880 --> 02:27:02.680]  That's mind control. You know, when you can explode the president's head in broad daylight
[02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:08.520]  and then shoot the guy who supposedly shot him on live television, that affects the collective
[02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:13.320]  unconscious of the entire nation. That was a message. And boy, did they send it. They
[02:27:13.320 --> 02:27:18.840]  got away with it. Yeah, Oswald, you know, it's interesting when Nixon, the reason Nixon was
[02:27:18.840 --> 02:27:24.920]  ousted was not what we've been told. Nixon threatened the CIA that he was going to have
[02:27:24.920 --> 02:27:29.560]  the FBI investigate the CIA about the Bay of Pigs thing, which Haldeman said is code for
[02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:35.400]  the Kennedy assassination because Hoover, you know, Oswald was working for Hoover.
[02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:38.840]  Yeah, that's even come out on the tapes. He wanted to actually he was a bad guy, but
[02:27:38.840 --> 02:27:42.840]  Nixon actually wanted to be president. And it's like, you know, the Bay of Pigs boys.
[02:27:43.400 --> 02:27:48.040]  You don't want to go there. That's Jack Kennedy threatening him with that. And the establishment.
[02:27:48.040 --> 02:27:53.160]  Really, buddy? Really? Well, JFK threatened them and they exploded his head. So Nixon should have
[02:27:53.160 --> 02:28:01.160]  known better. Keep going. They learned that the CIA had broken their charter and were getting
[02:28:01.160 --> 02:28:06.840]  into things like the Bay of Pigs and Vietnam, which weren't covert operations. We ran 2.6
[02:28:06.840 --> 02:28:13.080]  million troops through Vietnam. That's not covert. So Kennedy knew that the generals and the CIA
[02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:18.760]  were just, you know, really out to get him. That's right. Prior to the stage Gulf of
[02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:25.240]  Tonkin in 64, millions of people were rotated in as advisers. And how many tens of thousands
[02:28:25.240 --> 02:28:32.360]  died? But they're not counted to the official war tally. That's right. They say 56,000 or something.
[02:28:32.360 --> 02:28:37.640]  But there are more than that because you don't count the years that we were going in and
[02:28:37.640 --> 02:28:43.800]  sabotaging and doing all that stuff. Plus the million plus some people say three million
[02:28:43.800 --> 02:28:49.560]  women and children, Vietnamese non-combatants. Now this is dark stuff. That war was clearly
[02:28:49.560 --> 02:28:55.160]  a money-making war. When Kennedy was saying he wanted peace and détente, these guys just
[02:28:55.160 --> 02:28:59.800]  said, uh-oh. Oh yeah, they still have Vietnam war going if we stood for it, literally.
[02:28:59.800 --> 02:29:04.680]  Yeah, they made so much money there. And, you know, that was Eisenhower, Nixon. No one,
[02:29:04.680 --> 02:29:09.640]  it's like Truman. You know, everyone thought Dewey was going to win. And then Truman comes in.
[02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:14.600]  Truman didn't want the CIA. I hate Truman, by the way, because he dropped bombs unnecessarily
[02:29:14.600 --> 02:29:19.560]  on Japan, but he did do a couple of things that were pretty lucid. He didn't know that there were
[02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:24.280]  two CIA's. The Dulles brothers are running something out of the State Department and the
[02:29:24.280 --> 02:29:30.280]  regular CIA was trying to, you know, really catch or, you know, do their job. And when Truman found
[02:29:30.280 --> 02:29:35.160]  out about it, he just, his hands were tied. Absolutely. In fact, that's true. That's why
[02:29:35.160 --> 02:29:39.960]  I've always said the real, the real CIA is in the State Department. And then Patchenik's like,
[02:29:39.960 --> 02:29:44.920]  no, Alex, no, it's not actually him now. We'll be right back with Richard Belzer.
[02:29:44.920 --> 02:29:46.520]  Stay with us. Riveting information.
[02:29:50.440 --> 02:29:57.080]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:32:04.680 --> 02:32:09.960]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving for
[02:32:09.960 --> 02:32:14.360]  minerals and trace elements, as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that,
[02:32:14.360 --> 02:32:19.560]  I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.

[02:33:08.600 --> 02:33:26.680]  in different parts of the world. Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.680 --> 02:33:29.640]  All right, we'll take some of your phone calls here with Richard Belzer. I want to get a little
[02:33:29.640 --> 02:33:34.600]  bit more into the book. Everybody really should read it. It's available at infowarseteam.com,
[02:33:34.600 --> 02:33:41.720]  or you can call toll free, 888-253-3139. And you may think you know a lot about JFK.
[02:33:41.720 --> 02:33:48.440]  This really shows you all the people they set up, they killed, they demonized. It's a very,
[02:33:48.440 --> 02:33:54.360]  very important book, Hit List, the new book just coming out by Richard Belzer with David Wayne.
[02:33:55.160 --> 02:34:01.800]  Now expanding on all this, the head of the Italian Supreme Court, their chief justice,
[02:34:01.800 --> 02:34:07.800]  their CIA head has also come out and said that the West, that NATO has a terror group that stages
[02:34:07.800 --> 02:34:13.720]  terror attacks, and that they've used right wing communist terror, Muslim terror as a pretext to
[02:34:13.720 --> 02:34:18.040]  take everybody's rights. And that quote, the Bilderberg group is calling the shots and then
[02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:24.280]  he has proof. This is in the biggest Italian newspapers now. So my point is, is that no
[02:34:24.280 --> 02:34:28.840]  wonder the media is not supposed to report on Bilderberg over these years. That shows how
[02:34:28.840 --> 02:34:34.040]  important it is. Now that it's been forced out, Glenn Beck's like, Alex Jones shouldn't talk about
[02:34:34.040 --> 02:34:42.440]  Bilderberg. That's kooky. They don't run anything. I'm not even here to bash Glenn Beck. He does some
[02:34:42.440 --> 02:34:47.640]  good work. I wanna unify everybody. My point is, he won't even talk about him and makes fun of
[02:34:47.640 --> 02:34:51.560]  people. That's because they're at the top of the pyramid. But Richard continuing, let's get into
[02:34:51.560 --> 02:34:55.400]  some of the most important- Can I just say one quick thing, Alex? The Muslim Brotherhood are
[02:34:55.400 --> 02:35:01.880]  Nazis. They're not neo-Nazis. Allen Dulles convinced the Saudis to take them in after World
[02:35:01.880 --> 02:35:06.920]  War II- Sure. Because the Arabs were pro-Nazi. And the Grand Imam and all of it. And they all
[02:35:06.920 --> 02:35:13.800]  went to Saudi Arabia and guess what they did? They started the Madrasas. No, no, no, our government,
[02:35:13.800 --> 02:35:19.080]  you're absolutely right. I love it when somebody knows history. There was a scandal 15 years ago,
[02:35:19.080 --> 02:35:23.560]  the Washington Post reported. We were still paying hundreds of millions a year all over
[02:35:23.560 --> 02:35:29.960]  the Muslim world to pay for schoolbooks that said kill America. To this day.
[02:35:31.080 --> 02:35:36.600]  But you know, they're real Nazis. It's not like neo, they're second generation Nazis.
[02:35:36.600 --> 02:35:42.520]  Well, no, no, I mean, it's Raiders of the Lost Ark. They create the next group of opposition.
[02:35:42.520 --> 02:35:45.800]  That's why they're putting the Muslim Brotherhood in everywhere. And that's Obama.
[02:35:46.840 --> 02:35:51.640]  Well, it's just a formula that they always use. Obama is just, presidents are part-time workers.
[02:35:51.640 --> 02:35:55.640]  Exactly. That's why it takes off. It was like four months out of the year now.
[02:35:55.640 --> 02:35:58.680]  Now, now stopping right there, Richard, let's get into some more of the cases in the book.
[02:35:58.680 --> 02:36:03.960]  Sure. I think, you know, number one in the book is Tippett, who was very mysterious.
[02:36:03.960 --> 02:36:10.440]  You know, we found out that he worked for an intelligence unit in Dallas. He wasn't supposed
[02:36:10.440 --> 02:36:17.480]  to be where he was. It's very fishy. Oswald did not shoot Tippett. You know, the officer on the
[02:36:17.480 --> 02:36:24.600]  scene marked the shells at the scene. And then when he went to see the exhibits, there are
[02:36:24.600 --> 02:36:30.760]  different shells there. So, you know, it was a different gun. And Tippett was seen having
[02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:39.400]  breakfast with Oswald. He's a very fishy character. And we trace all his movements,
[02:36:39.400 --> 02:36:45.720]  which are very suspicious. He had no business being where he was. He was also seen with Ruby
[02:36:45.720 --> 02:36:53.160]  and, and Oswald. And a lot of people don't know that a lot of local police departments are
[02:36:53.160 --> 02:36:55.960]  infiltrated by military intelligence. Oh, massively.
[02:36:57.480 --> 02:37:05.080]  And so, and number two is Oswald, who, you know, had an FBI number. He's getting $200 a month from
[02:37:05.080 --> 02:37:11.640]  the FBI. Hoover was so interested in Oswald that in 1959, he wrote a memo saying, someone's using
[02:37:11.640 --> 02:37:17.320]  Lee Harvey Oswald's ID while he's, you know, overseas trying to buy trucks for Cubans. You
[02:37:17.320 --> 02:37:23.080]  know, like it's just been there. Ruby was a witness for Nixon in 1947.
[02:37:23.080 --> 02:37:26.680]  You know, a lot of people say he was low level, but I think that's a cover. If you look at what
[02:37:26.680 --> 02:37:32.440]  he really did, it's almost like he was a operational commander who, and then of course,
[02:37:32.440 --> 02:37:36.600]  that's who they burned to get Red to burn the whole thing down. They do that a lot.
[02:37:36.600 --> 02:37:42.920]  Yeah, that's a good point. They paint a picture of Oswald as a lone nod and kind of inarticulate,
[02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:47.080]  but they're, they're, they're at least two Oswald's that's goes without saying.
[02:37:47.080 --> 02:37:51.720]  And Oswald was recruited as a child or as a teenager. I mean, this guy was.
[02:37:51.720 --> 02:37:56.520]  Some theories about that. Well, yeah, he was a fake defector. When he was a young, you know,
[02:37:56.520 --> 02:38:02.440]  they sent like 18 or 19 Marines and army over to Russia to pretend they were defecting.
[02:38:02.440 --> 02:38:05.160]  Russia knew about each and every one of them virtually.
[02:38:05.160 --> 02:38:08.920]  Sure. But his recruitment, even into the military, if you go back and look at it,
[02:38:08.920 --> 02:38:11.480]  had all these connections as well. I mean, they, they, he was.
[02:38:11.480 --> 02:38:18.200]  I'm not surprised, but Hoover, that's why Nixon went to Hoover because he could blackmail the CIA.
[02:38:18.200 --> 02:38:25.960]  But the CIA was also using Oswald. So it got really, really sticky and messy for both agencies.
[02:38:25.960 --> 02:38:33.080]  And Oswald was supposed to be taken out in the, in the movie theater. And he wasn't, you know,
[02:38:33.080 --> 02:38:38.280]  so they had to get, well, you know, that story. Well, McVeigh got mad about them wanting him to
[02:38:38.280 --> 02:38:42.440]  blow up the Oklahoma city building. And he said, no kids, you know, no women, no kids like Tony
[02:38:42.440 --> 02:38:47.480]  Montana. He was special forces and it's the same deal. So they set him up. I mean,
[02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:55.640]  And Ruby is, you know, just the dirtiest. He was an informant in 1947 for Nixon for a crime
[02:38:55.640 --> 02:39:01.880]  commission. He ran drugs and guns through Cuba. You know, he put in a ton of money just before
[02:39:01.880 --> 02:39:07.000]  he went, not a ton, but you know, like 17 or 18 grand or something. You know, the timing of it
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:12.200]  was impeccable. He knew he was going to be murdered. You know, he said, and then they gave
[02:39:12.200 --> 02:39:19.000]  him this fast acting cancer. The CIA, as you know, Alex, can kill us in so many ways. So that's why
[02:39:19.640 --> 02:39:24.840]  you have to be really, really careful. I mean, they could walk by you and just spray some
[02:39:24.840 --> 02:39:31.880]  aerosol and it's over. So, you know, they have, they have a, an ice, they have a gun that shoots
[02:39:31.880 --> 02:39:38.680]  bullets that are made out of ice that looked like a period. So small that goes in and kills you and,
[02:39:38.680 --> 02:39:43.960]  you know, melts. And, you know, unless you're a genius forensics guy, you don't see that tiny,
[02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:51.320]  tiny hole. Anyway, you know, so the tippet. Speaking of tippet, to use a pun,
[02:39:51.320 --> 02:39:55.800]  the tip off they've killed somebody is when they immediately say no foul play,
[02:39:55.800 --> 02:40:00.760]  immediately say it's suicide or Breitbart's not even cold. And they're saying, oh no,
[02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:05.640]  heart attack. You know, 45 minutes after he's put into the hospital. I mean, it's,
[02:40:05.640 --> 02:40:09.560]  that's when you really know is when they immediately come out with the official story.
[02:40:09.560 --> 02:40:14.520]  Go ahead. Yeah, exactly right. That was, it's really fishy when, you know, I mean,
[02:40:14.520 --> 02:40:20.040]  they got Oswald what, 17 minutes later and had descriptions of him in New Zealand. Like,
[02:40:20.040 --> 02:40:26.360]  you know, he wasn't on the watch list. He was, but they didn't tell Dallas police. You know,
[02:40:26.360 --> 02:40:31.560]  it's very interesting because people don't understand there are elements within the Dallas
[02:40:31.560 --> 02:40:36.840]  police that had no knowledge of anything. There are elements that did, elements within the CIA
[02:40:36.840 --> 02:40:44.840]  and, you know, and like Grant Stockwell, you know, a big former ambassador to Ireland
[02:40:44.840 --> 02:40:50.840]  who fell or was pushed from his office window on the 13th floor of the DuPont building in midtown
[02:40:50.840 --> 02:40:58.120]  Manhattan, Miami. And they called it suicide. But you know, it's in like, two reporters,
[02:40:58.120 --> 02:41:03.800]  this is a good point. And I mean, I don't mean that in a light way, but Jim Coth and Bill Hunter
[02:41:04.360 --> 02:41:12.760]  were two reporters who were in a room where it was openly discussed prior to the murder of Kennedy
[02:41:12.760 --> 02:41:19.320]  about killing Kennedy at this Cuban woman's house. They happened to be there. Okay. Coth victim
[02:41:19.960 --> 02:41:28.200]  surprised a burglar and burglar killed him. Hunter, accidental shooting by a police officer.
[02:41:28.840 --> 02:41:34.440]  So those are two reporters that they just took out because they heard foreknowledge. One of the
[02:41:34.440 --> 02:41:40.040]  saddest, I think, is Dorothy Kilgallen, who, you know, people know from What's My Line, but she
[02:41:40.040 --> 02:41:47.720]  was a tough old broad in a true, respectful, non chauvinist sense and was a really good reporter.
[02:41:47.720 --> 02:41:53.560]  And she was the only person that got in to talk to Ruby by herself. There were reporters,
[02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:57.480]  some people said, oh, a lot of reporters were there. No, she got in a room with him alone.
[02:41:57.480 --> 02:42:03.560]  She told her agent, her best friend and two other people, she has all this explosive information.
[02:42:03.560 --> 02:42:09.960]  She's going to blow the lid off the Kennedy case. And word got out. So Hoover started demonizing
[02:42:09.960 --> 02:42:15.720]  her. And she said the FBI would be, had their time better spent, you know, investigating who killed
[02:42:15.720 --> 02:42:20.920]  our president than, you know, harassing me, you know. And so anyway, she- Now that's the
[02:42:20.920 --> 02:42:26.760]  demonization I was talking about. Keep going. Exactly. And she dies in bed with all her makeup
[02:42:26.760 --> 02:42:35.720]  on, you know, her eyelashes in a book on her that she already read. Her reading glasses were nowhere
[02:42:35.720 --> 02:42:41.000]  on site. They said she, you know, OD'd on barbiturates. There were three different kinds
[02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:46.040]  of barbiturates in her. She didn't, you know, they, but they said she, you know, she committed
[02:42:46.040 --> 02:42:52.200]  suicide or accidentally ingested barbiturates. They murdered her. Her best friend, who she
[02:42:52.200 --> 02:42:57.080]  gave, you know, who knew all about it, she died like a day or two later. You know, it's like David
[02:42:57.080 --> 02:43:03.000]  Ferry and that doctor he was working with. They were whacked within 48 hours because Ferry was-
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:06.360]  And by the way, everybody that serves the New World Order should understand this.
[02:43:07.160 --> 02:43:11.400]  They always end up getting rid of the people that do the dirty work. You're fools.
[02:43:11.960 --> 02:43:15.560]  You're absolutely right. Virtually everyone,
[02:43:16.760 --> 02:43:20.040]  populace obviously included, is expendable to these people.
[02:43:20.040 --> 02:43:23.880]  Except E. Howard Hunt. And they probably wish they had killed him now.
[02:43:23.880 --> 02:43:27.320]  Well, you know, it's the irony of that. I'm sure you've had St. John on, right?
[02:43:27.320 --> 02:43:29.480]  Yes. The son who he confessed to,
[02:43:29.480 --> 02:43:33.480]  and then he rallied and didn't die. He literally made a deathbed confession,
[02:43:34.040 --> 02:43:37.080]  and then he somehow lived a little longer, and then he had a recant.
[02:43:38.280 --> 02:43:42.680]  That guy was tough. His whole story, most of it's classified, but what we know,
[02:43:43.880 --> 02:43:48.680]  really, really wild guy. I mean, a sniper in World War II, the whole nine yards.
[02:43:48.680 --> 02:43:55.400]  PsyOps guy, really dark. You know, he had his ears operated on because, you know,
[02:43:55.400 --> 02:43:58.360]  ears are an identifying- After, yeah, he got picked up at the railway
[02:43:58.360 --> 02:44:01.480]  station. Tell folks about that. Yeah, well, you know, there's a guy who
[02:44:01.480 --> 02:44:09.400]  looks remarkable, the so-called tramps who were, for tramps, had new shoes on and were clean-shaven
[02:44:09.400 --> 02:44:14.760]  and were strolling cows- St. John Hunt remembers seeing that when he was a kid,
[02:44:14.760 --> 02:44:20.120]  hanging up in a phone booth when it came out and thinking, seeing, oh, Dad.
[02:44:20.120 --> 02:44:23.960]  He didn't even read that it was like, here's the tramps. It was a JFK seminar or something.
[02:44:23.960 --> 02:44:27.800]  That's right. It was a flyer. He goes, oh, Dad. And he
[02:44:27.800 --> 02:44:31.400]  immediately saw his dad. Yeah. That's right. So as you know,
[02:44:32.280 --> 02:44:37.800]  Spotlight Magazine wrote that Hunt was involved in the Kennedy murder. He sued them. They went
[02:44:37.800 --> 02:44:45.480]  to court. The magazine won. The jury believed that Hunt was involved in a conspiracy by the
[02:44:45.480 --> 02:44:50.600]  government to assassinate the president. That's a jury trial, you know, but he had his ears
[02:44:50.600 --> 02:44:56.680]  operated on so that by the time of the trial, so that, you know, he could maybe
[02:44:56.680 --> 02:45:00.520]  disguise his appearance. That was pretty, you know, lame, actually.
[02:45:01.800 --> 02:45:05.400]  And again, this is important because they just go, aha, the crazy people
[02:45:06.680 --> 02:45:10.120]  that think Kennedy, you know, was killed by more than one shooter, aha.
[02:45:11.640 --> 02:45:17.160]  Have you been saying there's a new world like 17 years, you know, now people thought you were
[02:45:17.160 --> 02:45:22.200]  crazy. And I've been railing about Kennedy since, you know, the 70s. And people roll their eyes at
[02:45:22.200 --> 02:45:27.720]  me. But now, you know, 90% in the average poll, as you source in your book, know that it was
[02:45:27.720 --> 02:45:34.920]  a conspiracy. So this is a victory for the truth. Even what do you think of Tom Hanks and all these
[02:45:34.920 --> 02:45:39.880]  people trying to resuscitate Humpty Dumpty? I'm going to tell you a story about this.
[02:45:39.880 --> 02:45:45.240]  I was at my friend Martin Short's house a couple of years ago, not to drop names.
[02:45:45.240 --> 02:45:50.840]  No, every year he has a Christmas party and every major celebrity is there. You know,
[02:45:50.840 --> 02:45:56.200]  it's a fun thing. And then Paul Shaffer or someone will go over to the piano and will sing and
[02:45:56.200 --> 02:46:01.320]  it's private. It's really cool. And Tom was there. This is about, I think, two or three
[02:46:01.320 --> 02:46:06.520]  new years ago. And I knew that he was going to, I read he's doing a 10 part series for HBO
[02:46:07.480 --> 02:46:12.280]  about the Kennedy assassination. And then I read, he said, oh, the conspiracy theorists
[02:46:12.280 --> 02:46:16.600]  are going to be upset with me. So I went over to him at this party and I don't usually do this,
[02:46:16.600 --> 02:46:24.200]  Alex, but I know Tom and I like Tom. I said, Tom, as a friend, I'm telling you, do not do
[02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:30.760]  this documentary. He said, well, I'm basing it on Vincent Bugliosi's book. I said, Tom,
[02:46:31.320 --> 02:46:36.920]  that was a prosecutor who had, you know, who did a steroid version of the Warren Commission.
[02:46:36.920 --> 02:46:41.720]  It's all false scholarship and the narrative is going to be an embarrassment. And that money would
[02:46:41.720 --> 02:46:48.840]  be much more well spent on other things, you know, like the vets or kids or, you know what I mean?
[02:46:48.840 --> 02:46:54.120]  Like millions of dollars to do 10 hours. Oswald did it. I just felt, you know, I'm paraphrasing,
[02:46:54.120 --> 02:46:58.600]  but that's essentially what I said to him. And then I explained to him why it was physically
[02:46:58.600 --> 02:47:02.760]  impossible for Oswald to even have fire to shut. You know, he's having lunch on the first floor.
[02:47:02.760 --> 02:47:07.960]  He went to the second floor. I mean, I don't want to get into the minutia, but I really wanted Tom
[02:47:07.960 --> 02:47:12.920]  not to do this, not to embarrass himself, not to misinform the public because he's a beloved guy.
[02:47:13.560 --> 02:47:19.320]  So time passes. I bumped into him at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame dinner backstage. He's got two
[02:47:19.320 --> 02:47:27.080]  security guys with him. And I just went over to say hello and he sees me. And this is the first
[02:47:27.080 --> 02:47:32.200]  time since the New Year's Eve party. And he comes over and, you know, we embrace and he goes, hey,
[02:47:32.200 --> 02:47:36.280]  Bells, don't worry, I'm on the case. And he scurries off, which he has never done to me.
[02:47:36.280 --> 02:47:42.040]  We always talk and joke and, you know, and just so, cause he thought I was going to ask him what's
[02:47:42.040 --> 02:47:47.480]  happening with the Kennedy thing. So, I mean, I love Tom, but he's now he's doing a movie.
[02:47:47.480 --> 02:47:52.280]  He's learned part of his lesson. He's not doing a 10 hour documentary anymore. He's doing a feature
[02:47:52.280 --> 02:47:58.600]  film about that day in Dallas and how it affected people. But it's gonna, you know, it's gonna
[02:47:58.600 --> 02:48:06.840]  reinforce this myth that- But the myth is so, I mean, if half the public thought the government
[02:48:06.840 --> 02:48:13.080]  killed Kennedy, it might work. He's really gonna hurt himself with this. Absolutely. Especially
[02:48:13.080 --> 02:48:18.600]  now, because Alex, it's the 50th anniversary. There's dozens and dozens of books. And I so
[02:48:18.600 --> 02:48:23.640]  appreciate you talking about my book because we really try to, you know, get through- No,
[02:48:23.640 --> 02:48:28.840]  I agree with your strategy. I mean, the killing of all these people is just ridiculous. I mean,
[02:48:28.840 --> 02:48:33.320]  they're covering it up. That's the evidence of the crime right there. If a cop pulls up
[02:48:33.320 --> 02:48:39.400]  and sees you look at them paranoidly running your house, that becomes almost probable cause.
[02:48:39.400 --> 02:48:43.400]  Well, when you've got piles of dead bodies and evidence of like someone shoving something in
[02:48:43.400 --> 02:48:49.240]  their pants, I mean, this is very suspicious. Yeah, it's terrifying, but you know what?
[02:48:49.240 --> 02:48:54.920]  A reasonable suspicion is the word, go ahead. Yeah, but you know, Thomas Jefferson and Adams,
[02:48:54.920 --> 02:49:00.680]  they were talking about if the electorate, if the people are not informed, then the country
[02:49:00.680 --> 02:49:05.480]  doesn't have any reason to- They said the great object is that the whole of the electorate be
[02:49:05.480 --> 02:49:11.080]  informed and educated about the way the world works, to paraphrase it, and then tyranny will
[02:49:11.080 --> 02:49:20.760]  vanish like phantoms at dawn. Exactly right. And you know, it's amazing that over 200 years ago,
[02:49:20.760 --> 02:49:27.000]  these guys predicted what could happen because, you know, they designed it where the country's
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:32.280]  a pyramid, but it's inverted. In other words, the people are at the top and the elected officials
[02:49:32.280 --> 02:49:36.920]  are at the bottom because the people are supposed to- Now they flipped it. So the elite now,
[02:49:36.920 --> 02:49:42.840]  that the, you know, and it gets fewer and fewer, which is really why I think we're making-
[02:49:42.840 --> 02:49:46.600]  Oh, you've seen how they're killing all these oligarchs and taking the money of the billionaires
[02:49:46.600 --> 02:49:50.520]  and, I mean, they are just looting the hell out of each other. And then it turns out the billionaires
[02:49:50.520 --> 02:49:55.720]  that robbed them aren't exempt. I mean, it's just good old fashioned mafia. And when good people
[02:49:55.720 --> 02:50:02.040]  give into corruption, it just invites more. I don't know- That's right. A lot of good people
[02:50:02.040 --> 02:50:06.920]  though are seduced into something thinking they're doing something, you know, for national security
[02:50:06.920 --> 02:50:09.960]  or, you know, but they're really fronting- Oh no, when I've been approached, you know,
[02:50:09.960 --> 02:50:14.040]  off record about big media jobs, they're like, Alex, globalism is real. We're lifting up the
[02:50:14.040 --> 02:50:17.800]  third world. And yeah, there is a new world order. We've got to lead the world. And Alex,
[02:50:17.800 --> 02:50:22.840]  the Federal Reserve cares. And how would you like to make 15 million, 20 million a year? How's that
[02:50:22.840 --> 02:50:28.360]  sound? You know, I mean, but that's how they come at you is you're going to be a good guy.
[02:50:28.360 --> 02:50:33.240]  But I'm sorry, I've looked at this tree's fruits, Richard. It is not putting out good fruit.
[02:50:33.240 --> 02:50:36.280]  You know, you and I both were inspired by this book.
[02:50:36.280 --> 02:50:37.720]  Don't dare call it conspiracy.
[02:50:37.720 --> 02:50:42.360]  Yeah, I read that. Look at my copy. It cost a dollar. That's how old I am.
[02:50:43.640 --> 02:50:45.560]  No, that really blew my mind.
[02:50:45.560 --> 02:50:48.360]  Hey bro, let's take a couple of segments of calls straight ahead. They're all over the map,
[02:50:48.360 --> 02:50:53.720]  but I promise I'm going to get to Brendan and Richard and Nick and David. The new book is out.

[02:52:34.200 --> 02:52:40.200]  never before. They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom
[02:52:40.200 --> 02:52:47.720]  and darkness. You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics
[02:52:47.720 --> 02:52:57.400]  dehumanization and ultimate extermination. The war is here. It's an info war, the spirit of 1776
[02:52:57.400 --> 02:53:03.640]  versus the mindset of 1984. Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best selling book
[02:53:03.640 --> 02:53:09.880]  cancer step outside the box. I want you to know some very important information. In 1985,
[02:53:09.880 --> 02:53:14.920]  President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when
[02:53:14.920 --> 02:53:20.760]  only the president could obtain this world class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules
[02:53:20.760 --> 02:53:25.720]  are used around the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones
[02:53:25.720 --> 02:53:31.000]  in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond
[02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:36.360]  to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell. If you want to stay healthy, now's
[02:53:36.360 --> 02:53:40.920]  your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't

[02:54:12.360 --> 02:54:17.320]  patiently since before Belzer joined us. You know, folks, I don't push something unless I believe in
[02:54:17.320 --> 02:54:23.480]  it. And I think you should get the book at Infowarsstore.com, hit list. You think I'm
[02:54:23.480 --> 02:54:28.760]  sick of JFK, I'm not. A book like this, I went through this in two nights reading it. And even
[02:54:28.760 --> 02:54:33.640]  learned some stuff I didn't know, went and looked up some facts. It's very scholarly with David
[02:54:33.640 --> 02:54:39.240]  Wayne, available at Infowarsstore.com. When you buy books, videos, t-shirts, all that at the site,
[02:54:39.240 --> 02:54:44.120]  you fund our operation. Don't forget Infowars Nightly News. You can get 11 memberships for $5.95
[02:54:44.120 --> 02:54:49.240]  a month and give it to your friends and family. Big Nightly News. You know what, I've got to go
[02:54:49.240 --> 02:54:56.680]  even into more overdrive because we've got a big ammo shortage rationing report a week in the
[02:54:56.680 --> 02:55:00.600]  making that David Knight finished. You know what, I'll premiere it on the Nightly News tonight and
[02:55:00.600 --> 02:55:06.200]  play it on the radio tomorrow. So I'll do that. That'll be tonight, 7 o'clock. Right now, let's
[02:55:06.200 --> 02:55:11.160]  talk to Brendan. I want to talk about guns, Mark Dyson, Bilderberg. Go ahead, Brendan,
[02:55:11.160 --> 02:55:16.120]  you're on the air. No, that's all right. That's what I was calling you to give out, but it's an
[02:55:16.120 --> 02:55:23.640]  honor to talk to Richard. I actually am holding in my hands a- Can you hear me? Yeah, I'm sorry,
[02:55:23.640 --> 02:55:26.680]  they forgot to turn him up to the guest room. It's not turned up properly there.
[02:55:28.760 --> 02:55:31.560]  He said it's an honor to talk to you, Richard. Go ahead, call her.
[02:55:32.440 --> 02:55:41.160]  Yep. And actually, I'm holding in my hands a red Freedom t-shirt from Infowars store that was
[02:55:41.160 --> 02:55:46.520]  signed by a comedian, Bill Burrow, who was in my restaurant last week. And it just made me think
[02:55:46.520 --> 02:55:52.120]  that it's an honor to talk to Richard and I wish more people would come out and talk about
[02:55:52.120 --> 02:55:56.760]  the things that they know in their hearts and are watching. So I talked to Bill Burrow-
[02:55:56.760 --> 02:56:01.000]  By the way, there are subtle ways they put- Can you do that a little more, please?
[02:56:01.960 --> 02:56:08.520]  Sorry. No, it's all right. Yeah, no, people a lot of times call in and they talk about
[02:56:08.520 --> 02:56:11.960]  like small talk and stuff, and that's great, and I appreciate your support. Do you have a question
[02:56:11.960 --> 02:56:18.520]  for Richard Belzer? How do you think we can turn on more people? I mean, maybe not Christopher
[02:56:18.520 --> 02:56:24.760]  Walken. How do you think we can reach out to more celebrities who are willing to talk about
[02:56:25.320 --> 02:56:29.960]  being awake and the things that are actually happening and not the mainstream media?
[02:56:29.960 --> 02:56:34.760]  That's a great question, Brendan. Thank you so much, and God bless you. They're from Wisconsin.
[02:56:34.760 --> 02:56:40.920]  Yeah, great question. Thanks, Brendan. Well, the problem is a lot of celebrities are terrified
[02:56:40.920 --> 02:56:46.920]  to take an extreme position unless it's like on the environment or something, and that's not a
[02:56:46.920 --> 02:56:51.960]  slam or- But if we have extreme tyranny, there's got to be an extreme response,
[02:56:51.960 --> 02:57:03.240]  as Barry Goldwater said. Yes, and I think that your show is growing actually daily,
[02:57:03.240 --> 02:57:09.880]  I would imagine, and weekly, and your brilliant idea of having people get access information,
[02:57:09.880 --> 02:57:15.880]  then turn on 50 other people, and it's like with my books, people tell other people,
[02:57:15.880 --> 02:57:23.320]  it's like it really is we the people. I mean, somehow the elites have kind of
[02:57:23.960 --> 02:57:32.840]  demonized the common man, which would make Jefferson puke. He admired the common man,
[02:57:32.840 --> 02:57:37.320]  the hardworking man. I'm not being patronizing on it. No, no, it's true.
[02:57:37.320 --> 02:57:43.400]  It's not class warfare. It's who we are. This is an amazing, open-hearted,
[02:57:43.400 --> 02:57:50.120]  multi-ethnic country that was a great idea, and slowly but surely, the International Banking
[02:57:50.120 --> 02:57:57.160]  Cartel, we didn't see it coming, but until what? The 50s or 60s, we started waking up,
[02:57:57.160 --> 02:58:00.040]  and when they started killing everybody and getting away with it.
[02:58:00.040 --> 02:58:03.720]  Well, that's the thing. America's always had problems, but as it got more and more corrupt,
[02:58:03.720 --> 02:58:08.440]  then the worst guy in the room becomes the boss, and then somebody worse replaces that group,
[02:58:08.440 --> 02:58:13.880]  and pretty soon you've got a bunch of people that want tyranny just because it's fun to exercise
[02:58:13.880 --> 02:58:16.600]  the power. Yeah, they're sociopaths,
[02:58:16.600 --> 02:58:23.000]  and it's about the money, but it's also about this power and this delight,
[02:58:23.800 --> 02:58:27.480]  and I'm talking in psychological terms. I have to tell you, it's very stupid.
[02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:32.520]  Well, hold on. We got to go to break. We're going to come right back with Richard Belzer
[02:58:32.520 --> 02:58:35.880]  to talk about the delight on the other side. If your station doesn't carry it,

[03:00:13.960 --> 03:00:22.120]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:24.600 --> 03:00:29.320]  Hey Richard, I want to get you on the nightly news in the next few weeks. Let's set this up,
[03:00:29.320 --> 03:00:34.920]  Richard Belzer is our guest, to go over all 50 people you put in the book that were mysteriously
[03:00:34.920 --> 03:00:39.800]  murdered. So we'll set that up after the show today. I want to apologize to your listeners
[03:00:39.800 --> 03:00:43.880]  because I do go on and I really want to, you know... You do not go on. In between me bringing up
[03:00:43.880 --> 03:00:47.640]  points and the callers, you're absolutely kicking butt. No, I want to get you on to
[03:00:47.640 --> 03:00:52.920]  really go over where you see society going on the TV show so that we have, you know,
[03:00:52.920 --> 03:00:57.160]  like an hour between commercials and I can do an extensive in-depth interview with you. But
[03:00:57.880 --> 03:01:02.360]  finishing up before we take a few more final calls, you were making a point about the delight,
[03:01:02.360 --> 03:01:07.800]  the establishment takes a delight in and then the break cuts you off. Yeah, what I'm studying now
[03:01:07.800 --> 03:01:15.080]  for my next book is to what extent are true sociopathic personalities dominating governments
[03:01:15.080 --> 03:01:20.840]  today and why do people tolerate them? You know what I mean? It's like there's a great book about
[03:01:21.800 --> 03:01:27.240]  the shaping of collective memory. It's like who owns the story? You know what I mean? Tom Wicker,
[03:01:27.240 --> 03:01:31.960]  Dan Rather, George Will, like four or five reporters, you know, they covered the Kennedy
[03:01:31.960 --> 03:01:35.720]  murder in 63. They don't own the narrative anymore. So what they're trying to do is just
[03:01:35.720 --> 03:01:41.320]  scramble the narrative where there is no narrative. That's exactly right. But people are still holding
[03:01:41.320 --> 03:01:46.280]  on to this narrative, you know, out of institutional embarrassment. That's why I think
[03:01:46.280 --> 03:01:53.240]  the corporate press is not just saying, OK, come on, you know, more than one person was involved.
[03:01:53.240 --> 03:01:59.160]  OK, you know, they won't even say that. And it's out of because they blew the story. And, you know,
[03:01:59.160 --> 03:02:06.520]  of all these great reporters, you know, have not even Congress, as you know, in the investigation,
[03:02:06.520 --> 03:02:12.520]  nobody talks about found it was a conspiracy. And if they get caught on this, it's over for them.
[03:02:13.320 --> 03:02:17.800]  Well, you know, a lot of people that were involved are no longer with us.
[03:02:17.800 --> 03:02:23.240]  There's no danger to the national security. I think it's an insult to the American people
[03:02:23.240 --> 03:02:30.520]  and patronizing and contentious to just officially keep, you know, denying this reality. This is the
[03:02:30.520 --> 03:02:36.440]  one of the ghostliest parts of our history. The Kennedy assassination is not taught in schools.
[03:02:36.440 --> 03:02:41.960]  It's one sentence or one paragraph. You know, it's very mysterious because it exposes
[03:02:42.520 --> 03:02:48.680]  who we are, this national security state that can kill a president, get away with it, brainwash
[03:02:48.680 --> 03:02:54.680]  a good deal of the public and shame those that question it. You know, it's a classic German,
[03:02:54.680 --> 03:03:01.880]  you know, I hate to keep doing this, but it's classic propaganda where, you know, the big lie,
[03:03:01.880 --> 03:03:06.920]  you know, it's a cliche, but it's true. You know, Goebbels said, you know, it's easy to control a
[03:03:06.920 --> 03:03:11.560]  country. All you have to do is invent a threat from the outside and then demonize those who
[03:03:11.560 --> 03:03:17.400]  question it. I'm paraphrasing, but, you know, and that's what they do. They're doing it now.
[03:03:17.400 --> 03:03:22.200]  It's like, it's scary. This thing about, you know, them busting the whistleblowers
[03:03:22.840 --> 03:03:27.560]  is really chilling stuff because everyone thought, oh, well, Obama's not going to be,
[03:03:27.560 --> 03:03:33.080]  you know, like Bush or whoever. There's only one party. It's the, you know, it's the Republicans.
[03:03:33.080 --> 03:03:39.800]  Oh yeah. And I mean, Obama is going after the press like no president's ever done and going
[03:03:39.800 --> 03:03:44.760]  after government people that expose, you know, stealing money. And then they go, no, we can
[03:03:44.760 --> 03:03:51.480]  steal the money. You're going to jail. Or your analogy of that bank that got busted
[03:03:51.480 --> 03:03:55.640]  for laundering money and, you know, and they paid a little fine. It was like, if you or I
[03:03:55.640 --> 03:04:00.760]  went in and held up a bank and got 5 million and they said, all right, give us a hundred grand and
[03:04:00.760 --> 03:04:06.120]  we'll let you go. Exactly. But we did the math. It was something like the equivalent, I think,
[03:04:06.120 --> 03:04:11.960]  of $3,000 out of a million. If you stole a million, it was, it was Wachovia and Wells
[03:04:11.960 --> 03:04:19.800]  Fargo, $378 billion in laundered money. And they paid a hundred and $1 million fine.
[03:04:19.800 --> 03:04:28.360]  That was for them. That's a joke. It's a joke. And it's like giving the cop a tip,
[03:04:28.360 --> 03:04:33.880]  like the cops help you bring the bags of money out to 15 vans. And then you give the cop a tip.
[03:04:33.880 --> 03:04:39.000]  It's like, thank you for, thank you for helping me with that. Yeah. Did I do that in my act?
[03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:42.120]  Absolutely. Hey, stay there. I'm going to come back to one more segment with you.
[03:04:42.120 --> 03:04:45.880]  As I promised to go to Richard wants to talk about gun control, Alex, Louisiana,
[03:04:45.880 --> 03:04:50.360]  arrest for filming police, Chad in Iowa, David in Colorado and Nick in Connecticut.
[03:04:50.360 --> 03:04:53.480]  We're going to just take those five, six calls. And then that's it because we're doing the
[03:04:53.480 --> 03:05:09.480]  nightly news tonight. Seven o'clock central prison, planet.tv. Get the book hit list.
[03:05:23.480 --> 03:05:30.360]  Shirts at info wars.com. It will wake up people in your area and support our operation. As we
[03:05:30.360 --> 03:05:36.040]  move to the next level, we need your help to spread the word like never before. They wish
[03:05:36.040 --> 03:05:41.800]  to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:05:41.800 --> 03:05:49.400]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics, dehumanization
[03:05:49.400 --> 03:05:57.880]  and ultimate extermination. The war is here. It's an info war. The spirit of 1776
[03:05:57.880 --> 03:06:04.040]  versus the mindset of 1984. Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book,
[03:06:04.040 --> 03:06:10.360]  cancer step outside the box. I want you to know some very important information. In 1985,
[03:06:10.360 --> 03:06:15.320]  president Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the white house at a time when
[03:06:15.320 --> 03:06:21.160]  only the president could obtain this world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules
[03:06:21.160 --> 03:06:26.120]  are used around the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones
[03:06:26.120 --> 03:06:31.400]  in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond
[03:06:31.400 --> 03:06:36.760]  to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell. If you want to stay healthy, now's
[03:06:36.760 --> 03:06:41.160]  your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that
[03:06:41.160 --> 03:06:50.680]  don't belong in your body. Call 1-866-VenusFly or order from Carnivora.com. That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com.

[03:06:59.400 --> 03:07:04.040]  the only one you've got. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. Amino acids have
[03:07:04.040 --> 03:07:08.360]  to be delivered to your body in the shape that nature gave them. If they are to be used to create
[03:07:08.360 --> 03:07:13.240]  new proteins in your body, just like a bricklayer cannot use bent or twisted bricks to build a brick
[03:07:13.240 --> 03:07:18.360]  wall, so, too, your body cannot use bent or twisted amino acids to build new proteins.
[03:07:18.360 --> 03:07:23.080]  Giving your body an undamaged amino acid food can make a huge difference in your health.
[03:07:23.080 --> 03:07:28.520]  One World Way is an undamaged amino acid food unlike any other. You see, heating bends and
[03:07:28.520 --> 03:07:34.520]  twists amino acids and all whey protein powders we've investigated and most proteins you consume
[03:07:34.520 --> 03:07:39.240]  are heated. With our true cool process, you now have a choice with One World Way.
[03:07:39.240 --> 03:07:45.480]  My name is Daniel. I'm 34 years old. When I started using One World Way, I weighed 228 pounds.
[03:07:45.480 --> 03:07:50.920]  Now, after two and a half months, I weigh 182 pounds. This is my ideal weight. I've noticed
[03:07:50.920 --> 03:07:55.480]  an increase in stamina, rate of recovery for workouts, and an increase in my potency.
[03:07:55.480 --> 03:08:00.200]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[03:08:00.200 --> 03:08:07.480]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:08.440 --> 03:08:14.440]  Well, it's terrible news, but I hope it's a gas main or something not terror-related
[03:08:14.440 --> 03:08:20.360]  explosion at the Boston Marathon. We'll punch up some feeds of this. We're in overdrive.
[03:08:20.360 --> 03:08:25.720]  We're live. It's 208 Central. And two explosions at Boston Marathon,
[03:08:25.720 --> 03:08:31.880]  people hurt in large explosions. Oh, man. Oh, my gosh. And that'll,
[03:08:31.880 --> 03:08:35.640]  well, are they going to blame it on Iran, blame it on the Patriot Group?
[03:08:36.520 --> 03:08:39.800]  Or is it going to be a veteran or something? I mean, this is just so horrible.
[03:08:41.160 --> 03:08:45.640]  And again, I hope nobody's really been hurt bad and also hope it's a gas main
[03:08:46.760 --> 03:08:52.440]  or something like that, because they will, again, they're going to turn all public events.
[03:08:52.440 --> 03:08:58.520]  First, it's have checkpoints at the airport. Then it's the mall. Then it's the sports stadium.
[03:08:58.520 --> 03:09:03.080]  Then it's the hotel. Then it's the highway. Then it's the bus station. It's already in Austin.
[03:09:03.640 --> 03:09:10.360]  Then it's Army at the Kite Festival. Then it's, oh, any event has to have troops at it.
[03:09:11.240 --> 03:09:15.480]  Two explosions at Boston Marathon, CNN producer, people hurt in large explosions.
[03:09:15.480 --> 03:09:20.520]  Obviously, nightly news tonight. Nightly news tonight. We'll have more details on
[03:09:20.520 --> 03:09:27.480]  this 7 o'clock central. I'm so sick of this. You know, Richard Belzer, journalist, best selling
[03:09:27.480 --> 03:09:33.560]  author, researcher, movie star, TV star, was kind of a side job. He's got a new book out, hit list.
[03:09:34.280 --> 03:09:37.400]  Knowing how much they use false flags, and of course, I should give people the website,
[03:09:37.400 --> 03:09:46.600]  it's BelzerBook.com, or I-Bels.com, like I-Bels.com, I-B-E-L-Z.com. I'm Alex Jones
[03:09:46.600 --> 03:09:53.160]  of themfullwars.com. Author of I'm Not a Cop, and any other co-authored How to Be a Stand-Up Comic
[03:09:53.160 --> 03:10:00.200]  and Dead Wrong, his most recently hit list. And he joins us right now. He's a talk show host as
[03:10:00.200 --> 03:10:07.000]  well. He's on everything. So, oh, and in the film, he was, wait a minute, Belzer? I'm gonna
[03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:12.680]  show my ignorance. You were in Scarface? Oh, yeah. I was on stage at the Babylon
[03:10:12.680 --> 03:10:17.880]  Club when they- No, no, that's right. It's hiding in plain view when they try to kill
[03:10:17.880 --> 03:10:22.200]  Tony. And you're going, everybody, let's give it to, and they're making fun of Cubans.
[03:10:22.200 --> 03:10:27.800]  Right. Oh my gosh, you're even cooler. Oh my, now I'm really jealous. Oh man,
[03:10:27.800 --> 03:10:31.880]  that's one of my favorite movies. And of course you're in that. Of course you're in that. Yeah,
[03:10:31.880 --> 03:10:39.000]  that's you. That's me with my Reagan hair. Oh my gosh. Anyways. You mentioned before about
[03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:45.080]  what we have to keep our eye on, and it's a marathon story, is the very first official
[03:10:45.080 --> 03:10:49.000]  reaction. Yeah, guys, save these recordings. Save all the recordings. Record everywhere.
[03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:55.160]  What? I'm telling the crew, record everywhere. Yeah. And yeah, how are they gonna paint this?
[03:10:56.760 --> 03:11:05.000]  I'm working with veterans now. I convinced the show I'm on, Law and Order, Special Victims Unit,
[03:11:05.000 --> 03:11:15.800]  to do an episode about a vet who had PTSD, and they tried to disparage him on the stand
[03:11:15.800 --> 03:11:21.080]  because he was having flashbacks and stuff, but he gathered himself and helped us convict someone.
[03:11:21.800 --> 03:11:26.120]  Because I wanted to make the vet the hero. Because when these kids come home, and they are,
[03:11:26.120 --> 03:11:33.320]  a lot of them kids, and their lives, their limbs, they're shattered. We robbed their money,
[03:11:33.320 --> 03:11:39.240]  they had tons of paperwork. It's really obscene. And when there was a shooting,
[03:11:41.720 --> 03:11:47.480]  there was a vet with shots, they said, oh, he's got PTSD. Nobody with PTSD is shooting anybody.
[03:11:47.480 --> 03:11:54.120]  That disease does not make people shoot people. Well, they're training the police that vets will
[03:11:54.120 --> 03:11:58.680]  target every police department and prepare for this war. And like I said, Nazi Germany
[03:11:58.680 --> 03:12:03.320]  targeted Jews, the Russians targeted other people, the Kulaks, the farmers.
[03:12:03.320 --> 03:12:06.520]  Have you seen all these reports where now Homeland Security says the new enemy
[03:12:06.520 --> 03:12:12.120]  is gonna be mainline Christians? I mean, it's so absurd as Drudge now running the headline,
[03:12:12.120 --> 03:12:18.920]  explosions at Boston Marathon. And the Boston Globe, all they have is a Twitter route.
[03:12:18.920 --> 03:12:24.360]  Boston and New England's leading news source. Green Line due to police activity,
[03:12:24.360 --> 03:12:32.040]  GL terminating. And it goes, multiple people injured, at least a dozen injured after explosion.
[03:12:32.040 --> 03:12:36.120]  Man, I hope this isn't a false flag or a real terror attack, Richard.
[03:12:36.120 --> 03:12:44.920]  No, I hope not. But they're gonna use it, even if it's innocent, they will use it because
[03:12:45.720 --> 03:12:53.160]  everyone's focused on it now. And people can be controlled when they're all on the same emotion
[03:12:53.160 --> 03:12:58.520]  at the same time. The government's been studying this since World War I, how to manipulate us.
[03:12:58.520 --> 03:13:03.240]  Exactly, nobody's supposed to be upset about all the murder and death going on with the globalists.
[03:13:03.240 --> 03:13:07.880]  They unfreeze our emotions though at certain times and tell us when we're supposed to get upset.
[03:13:08.760 --> 03:13:17.320]  That's so exactly classic mind control. And people used to call me crazy, but in 1954,
[03:13:17.320 --> 03:13:21.800]  they had the thing Operation Mockingbird where they were figuring out how to see
[03:13:21.800 --> 03:13:28.440]  through your television, okay? 1954, so what do you think they do now? I mean, they probably have
[03:13:29.880 --> 03:13:33.720]  cameras in our bathrooms to see what we excrete and then arrest us.
[03:13:36.040 --> 03:13:40.680]  Let's just fade up the Communist news channel, more like the corporate news channel.
[03:13:41.800 --> 03:13:42.840]  Let's fade this up. CNN?
[03:13:42.840 --> 03:13:47.560]  There's a whole process underway right now. But the reality of the situation is,
[03:13:47.560 --> 03:13:55.240]  it is almost impossible to protect an event, especially one that is over a protracted space
[03:13:55.240 --> 03:14:00.200]  as a marathon is. And I hate to say it, but these are the times that we live in.
[03:14:00.760 --> 03:14:04.920]  Richard, that's what they're saying on CNN. So they're already basically saying it's a
[03:14:04.920 --> 03:14:08.920]  terror attack, my goodness. We're helpless is what he's saying.
[03:14:08.920 --> 03:14:12.920]  That's so they can control us more. Now, Alex, I think I mentioned this last time I was on,
[03:14:12.920 --> 03:14:19.880]  but it bears repeating. During the Iraq War, SIOP officers from Fort Detrick, Maryland,
[03:14:19.880 --> 03:14:29.800]  were in CNN every day writing copy, approving stories, and shaping the vision of the war.
[03:14:29.800 --> 03:14:34.680]  So I'm sure they never went over, they say, well, that was just that. They're still there.
[03:14:37.160 --> 03:14:38.600]  Well, you know what I'm talking about. It's like-
[03:14:38.600 --> 03:14:42.280]  No, no, that even came out in the Washington Post and I talk about it and people don't
[03:14:42.280 --> 03:14:48.520]  believe me that WorldNetDaily and Washington Post broke it at the time. WorldNetDaily first,
[03:14:48.520 --> 03:14:53.080]  force Washington Post. And of course, Drudge carried it way back then. And of course,
[03:14:53.080 --> 03:14:57.400]  have you seen the White House Chief Advisor Obama saying how horrible Drudge is because
[03:14:57.400 --> 03:15:01.000]  they can't control the narratives? I mean, they're worried about one website.
[03:15:01.000 --> 03:15:05.480]  I think that's the good news is it shows that the emperor is wearing no clothes.
[03:15:05.480 --> 03:15:09.000]  If they're worried about DrudgeReport.com, if they're worried about Richard Belzer,
[03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:13.160]  they're worried about Alex Jones, they're worried about all of us not following along.
[03:15:13.160 --> 03:15:18.280]  We just shot video, by the way, for radio listeners at CNN showing cell phone footage
[03:15:18.280 --> 03:15:21.960]  already uploaded, showing what looks like a pretty good size explosion and smoke.
[03:15:22.520 --> 03:15:26.360]  And so then they're saying at least a dozen. This looks really bad. Looks like somebody blew
[03:15:26.360 --> 03:15:33.800]  up bleachers. No. My God, I'm so sick of this. And there's no word on who's claiming responsibility?
[03:15:33.800 --> 03:15:38.120]  Who knows? But I know this, they got TSA ready to roll out nationwide.
[03:15:38.120 --> 03:15:42.520]  They're already doing it, but I've talked to insiders. They're going to be everywhere now,
[03:15:42.520 --> 03:15:47.160]  just federal checkpoints. I mean, can you believe this is as if you're going to stop
[03:15:47.160 --> 03:15:51.080]  anybody that wants to bomb something? Well, I'm actually getting a little
[03:15:51.080 --> 03:15:55.480]  sick to my stomach because when he said, unfortunately, these are the times we live in.
[03:15:56.200 --> 03:16:02.280]  So then when we see soldiers at our kids little league game, we see soldiers
[03:16:02.280 --> 03:16:07.960]  everywhere. We're supposed to feel safe. Exactly. Notice how they've been already
[03:16:07.960 --> 03:16:13.720]  acclimating. Notice how they've already been in the news going. And soldiers are now at the kite
[03:16:13.720 --> 03:16:19.640]  festivals. They're at barbecues. They're searching people. And I've been telling people they're
[03:16:19.640 --> 03:16:24.040]  getting ready to hit soft targets all over the country. People say, well, who's the main
[03:16:25.720 --> 03:16:30.040]  motive here? Well, who stands to gain? When the government and the shadow government has
[03:16:30.040 --> 03:16:36.280]  been gearing up to roll out and be our savior and they stand to gain from it, it's obvious.
[03:16:36.280 --> 03:16:42.440]  I mean, who's the number one suspect in this, Richard Belzer, as a journalist, as a crime
[03:16:42.440 --> 03:16:49.960]  writer in the past? Whoever the suspect is, the government will appropriate it and create a
[03:16:49.960 --> 03:16:57.800]  narrative. And 90% of it probably, I'm just guessing, will be a fabrication to shape our
[03:16:57.800 --> 03:17:04.600]  thought of police and military and safety. And they're licking their chops. Even if this was a
[03:17:04.600 --> 03:17:13.640]  gas main, they still got to study how we reacted. And that's why even events that they don't do,
[03:17:13.640 --> 03:17:18.120]  they study. Yeah, I mean, it could have been a truck running over a gas main. I mean, all the
[03:17:18.120 --> 03:17:22.760]  time I see in the paper, gas main blows up, kills 30 people. It's not even in the news. It's like
[03:17:22.760 --> 03:17:29.080]  back of the paper, barely a blur. But I guarantee you, five people die from this. All you'll hear
[03:17:29.080 --> 03:17:34.920]  is pell-mell Pavlovian, be scared of the random man. Be scared, only we can save you. I mean,
[03:17:34.920 --> 03:17:41.480]  just the response shows how fake all this is. Yeah, I'm gonna predict that the hook for them
[03:17:41.480 --> 03:17:45.480]  is gonna be, these are the times we live in. And everyone will just surrender and let them.
[03:17:47.160 --> 03:17:50.600]  How much do you wanna bet if you tune into all five networks? They're gonna be saying,
[03:17:50.600 --> 03:17:54.760]  these are the times we live in. These are the, exactly, they've always got some like,
[03:17:54.760 --> 03:17:59.000]  we gotta give all our rights up now. This is the end of America as we knew it, 9-11. Why?
[03:17:59.000 --> 03:18:03.080]  Why give up all my rights because of another made up narrative?
[03:18:03.880 --> 03:18:10.680]  Yeah, and it's interesting because clearly there are bad people, but there aren't millions of them
[03:18:10.680 --> 03:18:15.480]  or even thousands. You know what I mean? There's probably a few hundred people that are really
[03:18:15.480 --> 03:18:21.320]  demonic and crazy and might hurt us. You don't imprison 310 million people because there's a
[03:18:21.320 --> 03:18:27.960]  few hundred people that are, whatever they are, drug addicts or crazy or, I mean, I don't know.
[03:18:27.960 --> 03:18:33.720]  But it's like, we still have to take our shoes off because some plant from our government
[03:18:33.720 --> 03:18:36.200]  had this device that wouldn't have taken down the plane anyway.
[03:18:36.200 --> 03:18:40.760]  Well, that's another thing. Even the New York Times and even the Washington Globe of all places
[03:18:40.760 --> 03:18:47.240]  have done reports the last few years about the hundred plus fake FBI deals where they find 75 IQ
[03:18:47.240 --> 03:18:53.000]  mentally ill people. And then have them build a bomb and say, now blow up the Christmas tree
[03:18:53.000 --> 03:18:57.240]  just to take over the Christmas coverage. And every time, I mean, I could go out,
[03:18:57.240 --> 03:19:01.640]  I would never do it. I don't want them to edit that and find a mentally ill person, Richard.
[03:19:01.640 --> 03:19:07.400]  And for $10,000, have them drive a bomb wherever I want it. I mean, the schizophrenic
[03:19:07.400 --> 03:19:10.840]  victims are everywhere. No, that's an excellent point because
[03:19:12.600 --> 03:19:17.560]  they know who to target and who to recruit. Like a lot of people, like you said before,
[03:19:18.120 --> 03:19:24.600]  Oswald was probably recruited much sooner than we ever suspected, but he was clearly chosen
[03:19:24.600 --> 03:19:29.960]  to be a fake defector and had these false IDs. And he was much, one of them anyway,
[03:19:29.960 --> 03:19:34.360]  was very intelligent. And the other one may have been not as-
[03:19:34.360 --> 03:19:37.880]  Well, the good news is, let's do one more segment. Richard Belzer, our guest,
[03:19:37.880 --> 03:19:40.920]  and I'm sorry to callers, I got breaking news here, but I'll try to get to you,
[03:19:40.920 --> 03:19:46.760]  David and Colorado and others. Man, I tell you, all I know is they're like building up,
[03:19:46.760 --> 03:19:53.240]  like get ready for soft target attacks at, David said, marathons, sporting events, malls.

[03:22:33.720 --> 03:22:38.600]  advisors won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet the financial
[03:22:38.600 --> 03:22:43.080]  industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold has outperformed paper
[03:22:43.080 --> 03:22:47.400]  investments, yet don't worry about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement,
[03:22:47.400 --> 03:22:55.880]  call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns. Call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:55.880 --> 03:23:03.400]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237. It's time for a home security quiz. What effective
[03:23:03.400 --> 03:23:08.440]  home security device is smaller than a coffee cup fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home
[03:23:08.440 --> 03:23:13.400]  at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police
[03:23:13.400 --> 03:23:20.360]  departments and sells for less than $30? Yes, it's fake TV. This year about one in every 50
[03:23:20.360 --> 03:23:25.400]  U.S. homes will have a break-in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house
[03:23:25.400 --> 03:23:31.160]  that looks like no one is home. Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like
[03:23:31.160 --> 03:23:37.240]  someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV. Fake TV could be the
[03:23:37.240 --> 03:23:42.440]  difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked. To get your fake
[03:23:42.440 --> 03:23:54.680]  TV for only $29.95 with free shipping, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5FAKETV. That's 877-532-5388.
[03:23:54.680 --> 03:24:09.400]  Or go to faketv.com. Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[03:24:09.400 --> 03:24:19.080]  And we're going to try to stop the wave of false flag terror that's going to be blamed on us before
[03:24:19.080 --> 03:24:24.680]  it happens. It looks like that hadn't been the case. This may be blamed on Iran. If they try to
[03:24:24.680 --> 03:24:28.520]  blame it on Al-Qaeda, I'm not putting up with it when the government runs Al-Qaeda publicly.
[03:24:29.080 --> 03:24:32.840]  I mean, and just wait, like I said, at the start of the show until they start shooting down
[03:24:32.840 --> 03:24:37.080]  aircraft with the 10,000 heat-seeking missiles given to them by our government
[03:24:37.080 --> 03:24:41.160]  when they took over Libya. I mean, and ladies and gentlemen, I'm looking at Twitter photos.
[03:24:41.160 --> 03:24:45.640]  If you've got children in the room, don't watch our video stream. People's arms, legs blown off.
[03:24:45.640 --> 03:24:50.120]  In fact, take down the Enforce logo. You can see that guy with his face blown off and his
[03:24:50.120 --> 03:24:56.840]  leg blown off at the hip. Oh, my God. That's war, folks. When a predator drops a 1,000-pound bomb
[03:24:56.840 --> 03:25:01.960]  on a village, you'll have hundreds of people like soup. They did that to the Branch Davidians as
[03:25:01.960 --> 03:25:07.880]  well with a shape charge. So now remember, when they kill innocent people, they dehumanize them
[03:25:07.880 --> 03:25:13.800]  and don't even talk about it. And CNN and stuff won't show gun pod helicopter footage of families
[03:25:13.800 --> 03:25:18.840]  getting shot. You put that on YouTube, they take down your account. But this, they'll be putting
[03:25:18.840 --> 03:25:25.400]  all this out. And you could see from helicopter the blood everywhere. So what it looks like is,
[03:25:25.400 --> 03:25:30.360]  across the street from the bleachers in another seating area, or where a group of hundreds of
[03:25:30.360 --> 03:25:36.680]  people were standing to watch, somebody detonated multiple bombs, turning people into what looks
[03:25:36.680 --> 03:25:41.560]  like giant troughs of sloppy Joes. And I'm sorry to have to give details here. Look at that.
[03:25:41.560 --> 03:25:48.120]  Oh, my gosh. It actually knocked people over 50, 60 yards away. Looks like it had some shrapnel
[03:25:48.120 --> 03:25:54.040]  involved in it. You can see runners blown over. Ladies and gentlemen, Richard, let's throw this
[03:25:54.040 --> 03:25:59.880]  out. You've had these prosecutors getting killed. I said Mexican Mafia or white supremacists,
[03:25:59.880 --> 03:26:04.680]  only because those are the groups that usually, who aren't staged, who have the will to kill
[03:26:04.680 --> 03:26:11.000]  people. But with this Muslim extremists they're gonna pin it on? Or will they pin it on the new
[03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:17.960]  enemy, the Patriots? Go ahead. Well, they have a menu of what will best serve their needs. I'm
[03:26:17.960 --> 03:26:25.640]  with you. I pray that it's not like Al Qaeda who we invented. Osama bin Laden did not use the term
[03:26:25.640 --> 03:26:33.400]  Al Qaeda until after 9-11. It was invented by us to use the RICO statute to ensnare him in some
[03:26:33.960 --> 03:26:40.600]  legal case. So he was never a mastermind. They just used him. He would fund different groups.
[03:26:40.600 --> 03:26:46.040]  Al Qaeda is a myth that we use, as Muslim Brotherhood is scarier because they're real
[03:26:46.040 --> 03:26:49.880]  knots. The British foreign minister said that and they killed him like a week later. He said,
[03:26:49.880 --> 03:26:54.840]  it's the name of a code name in a CIA database. Bin Laden works for us. Boom, heart attack week
[03:26:54.840 --> 03:27:00.440]  later. When was that? That was Robin Cook. I'm going from memory, Robin Cook. Yes, that's right.
[03:27:00.440 --> 03:27:08.520]  That's right. And so when you tell me that it seems like it was detonated from a different place,
[03:27:08.520 --> 03:27:18.520]  this is not an amateur, Alex. This was no amateur job. This was meant as an act of terror, either by
[03:27:19.400 --> 03:27:25.320]  our government or real terrorists or rogue elements within our government. Here we are,
[03:27:25.320 --> 03:27:32.840]  speculating on what it is. We're suspending our natural instinctive desires and lives and not
[03:27:32.840 --> 03:27:38.440]  thinking about sustenance or our families or anything or anything spiritual. We're thinking
[03:27:38.440 --> 03:27:44.120]  about these limbs and people being exploded. And it makes us focus in now on all the fear.
[03:27:44.920 --> 03:27:49.640]  Oh, they've got to go ahead and take our guns. What if a terrorist goes to the Boston Marathon
[03:27:49.640 --> 03:27:57.080]  with guns next? Oh my goodness, this is just unbelievable. And I mean, have you seen the
[03:27:57.080 --> 03:28:04.360]  footage yet of people exploding? No, I'm afraid to, frankly. And it's going to make me sick
[03:28:04.920 --> 03:28:10.840]  because I know that in addition to the human suffering, people, human beings,
[03:28:10.840 --> 03:28:14.680]  you know, and that's another thing about the Kennedy assassination, a man was killed that day.
[03:28:14.680 --> 03:28:20.360]  You know, sometimes we lose sight of the fact, but you know, human beings have been mangled
[03:28:20.360 --> 03:28:26.520]  and we're all human. So collectively we're going to react to it. And so for guys like us,
[03:28:26.520 --> 03:28:33.080]  it's doubly sickening, just alone as a human, you know, the humanity of it. But we know that
[03:28:33.080 --> 03:28:37.560]  it's going to be used in some way or may have been perpetrated in some way. You know, that's
[03:28:37.560 --> 03:28:42.440]  what makes us twice as sick as the rest. Yeah, I would actually be happy if it was a random person
[03:28:42.440 --> 03:28:47.000]  and it actually came out because that's not as scary as a big organized government. The media
[03:28:47.000 --> 03:28:51.640]  always says, Alex says the government did it because that's not as scary as random people.
[03:28:51.640 --> 03:28:56.600]  No, what's scary is that a big powerful organization is doing it and then posing as the
[03:28:56.600 --> 03:29:01.800]  savior and getting caught doing it over and over again. I mean, you talk about Vietnam in those
[03:29:01.800 --> 03:29:08.280]  years from 59 until 64, it's been declassified, hundreds of bombings in the country to be blamed
[03:29:08.280 --> 03:29:14.600]  on the communist. And again, I'm no fan of the communist because they did stuff like that too,
[03:29:14.600 --> 03:29:21.720]  but it's just like governments just do this, folks. Well, you know, the, the, uh, Hoover got
[03:29:21.720 --> 03:29:28.440]  rid of the FBI because there was a blank FBI agent within it that helped bring it down. Uh, Hoover
[03:29:28.440 --> 03:29:33.240]  helped Eisenhower, uh, the head of the American communist party. I'm not a fan of the communist
[03:29:33.240 --> 03:29:40.440]  either, but he was in the FBI, every organization. That's why you have to be careful. Uh, a lot of
[03:29:40.440 --> 03:29:44.120]  organizations finish your point on the other side. I'm going over drive this whole hour and I'll be
[03:29:44.120 --> 03:29:48.520]  live tonight. We're doing info Wars, nightly news live. And then we'll have the packages after seven
[03:29:48.520 --> 03:29:57.400]  o'clock central. We're on the March, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[03:30:48.280 --> 03:30:58.040]  dehumanization, and ultimate extermination. The war is here. It's an info war, the spirit of 1776

[03:33:17.640 --> 03:33:36.680]  Ladies and gentlemen I said I'd go to your phone calls and I am but I feel like I should
[03:33:36.680 --> 03:33:41.560]  wipe these calls clean even though they've been holding some of them for an hour. To open the
[03:33:41.560 --> 03:33:48.360]  phones up for people in Boston. So what I want what I want John Harmon to do is get these callers
[03:33:48.360 --> 03:33:54.200]  number right now and we will call them back tomorrow or later. We're going to go ahead and
[03:33:54.200 --> 03:34:01.080]  go live for at least two more hours today with the video streams at prisonplanet.tv
[03:34:01.080 --> 03:34:05.880]  and the audio streams at infowars.com. We're going to go ahead and go live and we're going
[03:34:05.880 --> 03:34:13.960]  to have Jakari Jackson and David Knighton here live to take your phone calls and more. We'll
[03:34:13.960 --> 03:34:18.440]  get a couple video reports ready at the start of the next hour. We're going to go commercial free.
[03:34:18.440 --> 03:34:22.680]  We need a break while they get in here and get ready and then they can also recap and we'll be
[03:34:22.680 --> 03:34:27.640]  feeding them news as it breaks and then I'll be able to tell you more at seven o'clock central
[03:34:27.640 --> 03:34:36.600]  tonight. I will host Infowars Nightly News live which we've done 40, 50 times or so. So we've
[03:34:36.600 --> 03:34:40.680]  done it quite a bit like we had like a whole month where it was live every night. So because we're
[03:34:40.680 --> 03:34:45.000]  considering live show versus tape shows sometimes it's a mix. A bunch of special reports and stuff
[03:34:45.000 --> 03:34:51.080]  tonight. Again I've been telling everybody this in the last few months and long time listeners
[03:34:51.080 --> 03:34:55.320]  know this. You notice I've turned the heat up. I've gotten more aggressive. I've said I'm
[03:34:55.320 --> 03:35:00.440]  committed and I've also told you and I've told my wife and the whole crew this. I've never,
[03:35:01.640 --> 03:35:10.120]  never, never, it's not even anxiety. It's just absolute the feeling I had a few times in my life
[03:35:10.120 --> 03:35:14.840]  where somebody was about to walk around a corner out of the blue and mug me and you're just like
[03:35:14.840 --> 03:35:19.960]  why do I feel so bummed out? Why do I feel like there's danger and then there it is or you wake
[03:35:19.960 --> 03:35:23.720]  up one day and you're driving to work and you go man why do I feel weird and then you see cars
[03:35:23.720 --> 03:35:29.080]  run to each other and kids flying out you know on the Dallas Central Expressway. I've unfortunately
[03:35:29.080 --> 03:35:35.560]  probably seen seven or eight. I start thinking about it more fatality crashes in my life.
[03:35:35.560 --> 03:35:39.240]  I've pulled over when arms are chopped off and blood spring you know 10 feet in the air.
[03:35:41.160 --> 03:35:47.240]  Oh God and I know that feeling right before it happens. There is a sixth sense. Ants, you know
[03:35:47.880 --> 03:35:52.040]  birds, mammals even have more of it. We've just been taught it isn't there.
[03:35:52.040 --> 03:35:57.160]  And again the globalists are killing people all over the world and I'm not feeling a disturbance
[03:35:57.160 --> 03:36:01.800]  in the force you know to be sarcastic but that's really you know kind of what they're talking about
[03:36:01.800 --> 03:36:07.000]  there. We all have that sixth sense. I have been seeing a massive buildup not like it's not obvious
[03:36:07.000 --> 03:36:11.800]  billions of bullets, armored vehicles, prepare to arrest the Christians in mass, state police
[03:36:11.800 --> 03:36:18.520]  going public saying this is crazy. I drive around Austin now we see TSA checkpoints and
[03:36:18.520 --> 03:36:25.080]  National Guard. You know I can't go to like a succulent event, the city of Austin succulent
[03:36:25.080 --> 03:36:31.640]  event. I think I forgot about this. I drove by Zilker Park yesterday. They were having this
[03:36:31.640 --> 03:36:38.440]  succulent plant type of plant event. We're going to our guest here and I looked and I go there's
[03:36:38.440 --> 03:36:45.320]  troops again. I mean I just, just troops everywhere. Okay this is a roll out ahead of them
[03:36:45.320 --> 03:36:48.920]  taking everybody's bank account. Let me tell all the idiots out there that want to take other
[03:36:48.920 --> 03:36:56.120]  people's second amendment. They're going to take your money too and everything and I guess it's
[03:36:56.120 --> 03:37:00.920]  for me the realization that I've been right about all this and not that it was hard to be right.
[03:37:00.920 --> 03:37:07.080]  It's just I get why people are in denial because what do you do when faced with evil? What do you
[03:37:07.080 --> 03:37:13.640]  do when it's just galloping and growing and oozing and threatening and killing and again
[03:37:13.640 --> 03:37:19.000]  I hope you know now they're saying they're reporting a bunch of stuff right now but I mean
[03:37:21.000 --> 03:37:26.680]  it shows a bunch of piles of bloody people and again there are it's not like it's a unicorn.
[03:37:26.680 --> 03:37:32.360]  Unicorns don't exist. There are real organic terror attacks that happen. They're very very rare.
[03:37:32.360 --> 03:37:37.000]  They mainly happen in Israel in places like when a woman goes on a bus and stabs 14 people. I mean
[03:37:37.000 --> 03:37:44.120]  that's a crime of passion. That's real but even most of that stuff it's come on Israel you know
[03:37:44.120 --> 03:37:48.280]  created fake al-qaeda and stuff whenever they want to be able to take rights or something. All these
[03:37:48.280 --> 03:37:53.000]  governments do it. The Italian supreme court justice I was just talking about minutes before
[03:37:53.000 --> 03:37:57.400]  it happened he came out last week and said Bilderberg's staging terror attacks and here are
[03:37:57.400 --> 03:38:02.840]  the documents. We gotta keep an eye on him. Better keep and Richard I'm ranting here and I want to
[03:38:02.840 --> 03:38:08.360]  go to these calls. No you're not. No you're not. You're on the money. No I'm glad you mentioned
[03:38:08.360 --> 03:38:13.160]  the Italian. Let's see what happens to him in the next month or two. Oh he's discredited and
[03:38:13.160 --> 03:38:21.160]  demonized. You know Machiavelli he said that what you do is you take a person's best quality
[03:38:22.040 --> 03:38:29.080]  and attack that you know not like make up something you know it's so it's like that's what
[03:38:29.080 --> 03:38:35.160]  I'm not I wasn't a big fan of Kerry but you know he did get shot he was you know he had a uniform
[03:38:35.160 --> 03:38:41.880]  on more than Bush did and was in combat but they made him into a wimp you know it's like you can
[03:38:41.880 --> 03:38:48.120]  make people's brains do tricks and this thing is. Well exactly like look at this bad person they
[03:38:48.120 --> 03:38:53.560]  help children that's because they want a grandstand you know they can take anything and spin it yeah.
[03:38:53.560 --> 03:38:59.400]  Yeah and so we got to be real I'm so glad you're staying on because and monitoring this because
[03:39:01.080 --> 03:39:07.960]  as I learned with the the assassination of John Kennedy I studied what was said immediately after
[03:39:08.840 --> 03:39:15.320]  you know the first 24, 36, 48 hours there was all kinds of stuff that just went away about multiple
[03:39:15.320 --> 03:39:20.520]  shooters and guys running away with guns and you know just like and they somehow just scrub all
[03:39:20.520 --> 03:39:27.720]  that but that's why I'm glad that you know you have the facility and and and the bullhorn now to
[03:39:27.720 --> 03:39:33.080]  cover this event and give the alternative which now is the real point of view not the.
[03:39:33.080 --> 03:39:36.520]  Well listen I'll be honest with you we're going to go to people in Massachusetts right now
[03:39:36.520 --> 03:39:40.280]  we're going to open the phones up but I mean my point is I'm going to be honest with you
[03:39:40.840 --> 03:39:47.080]  Richard we're going to go look at what our viewers pick up and what they email us they will be the
[03:39:47.080 --> 03:39:51.800]  ones and our listeners that are going to analyze kind of like that real collective resistance in
[03:39:51.800 --> 03:39:57.880]  brain and by seven o'clock tonight if there are any you know obvious signs or the system milking
[03:39:57.880 --> 03:40:04.600]  it or unification across all channels with talking points immediately that'll be the telltale sign.
[03:40:04.600 --> 03:40:11.240]  If if people can check their DVRs folks yeah and and notice the exact same scripting minute one
[03:40:11.240 --> 03:40:16.840]  then you know it's key phrases because sometimes there's real events and different networks will
[03:40:16.840 --> 03:40:21.240]  go with different angles and it turns out it's a real event if they're all minute one the same
[03:40:21.240 --> 03:40:29.320]  script like 9-11 or JFK you know the fix is in. Exactly and I had like you said I hope it let us
[03:40:29.320 --> 03:40:35.640]  take calls but I hope it is just some random person and not you know a plot. I'm sure you've
[03:40:35.640 --> 03:40:39.240]  heard that talking point where they go they think the government was involved because they want to
[03:40:39.240 --> 03:40:43.400]  believe somebody's in control and it's scarier that random people could do this what do you
[03:40:43.400 --> 03:40:49.880]  mean it's a hundred times scarier organized evil. Yeah and random people don't do medical
[03:40:49.880 --> 03:40:54.040]  experiments on their own people. Exactly and think how many times our government's done that
[03:40:54.040 --> 03:40:58.920]  they're not having CNN reports about how scary it is the thousands of lethal secret tests on
[03:40:58.920 --> 03:41:06.440]  little kids troops black people uh 800-259-9231 then we go to the next hour we'll give out our
[03:41:06.440 --> 03:41:11.720]  local number it's toll free but our our number here uh and again our our regular phone guy is
[03:41:11.720 --> 03:41:15.160]  actually sick today we got a bunch of people sick today so our crew is limited but we're
[03:41:15.160 --> 03:41:20.840]  going to do this great job to the crew by the way you guys are all entering. Oh my gosh oh my gosh
[03:41:20.840 --> 03:41:27.080]  oh my gosh oh my gosh I just realized it's Patriots day in Massachusetts and April 19th
[03:41:27.080 --> 03:41:32.040]  is the national one oh my gosh that that that bumps up the death con that they're going to
[03:41:32.040 --> 03:41:36.760]  blame it on a patriot group anyways I'm sorry I'm just brainstorming. No no that's various too.
[03:41:36.760 --> 03:41:41.320]  Keep well no no John Ballen just said it in fact if that's Patriots day in Massachusetts
[03:41:41.320 --> 03:41:45.240]  where it all started and then and then the 19th is a few days later when the big stuff happened
[03:41:45.240 --> 03:41:53.160]  folks here is the here is the toll-free number 800-259-9231 what have you noticed watching the
[03:41:53.160 --> 03:41:58.040]  news that's just as important is if you're even in mash but particularly if you're in Boston I
[03:41:58.040 --> 03:42:04.520]  know we have listeners everywhere 800-259-9231 please only call if you have a tidbit of key intel
[03:42:04.520 --> 03:42:11.880]  or if you were there or have family that was there 800-259-9231 and I pray that those bomb
[03:42:11.880 --> 03:42:17.880]  with their legs blown off and their faces blown off survive and I just pray for everybody whoever
[03:42:17.880 --> 03:42:22.840]  your god is folks this is just horrible and and again this could be the start of a whole bunch of
[03:42:22.840 --> 03:42:28.280]  this stuff okay because they're saying the the libertarians will start bombing everything and
[03:42:28.280 --> 03:42:33.320]  then if it starts happening and they blame it on us if it comes out and they say it's a libertarian
[03:42:33.320 --> 03:42:39.160]  group folks we are in deep crap it means they're going ahead with it if they say it's Iran there
[03:42:39.160 --> 03:42:43.800]  is no way Iran would pull something like this no they wouldn't knowing that they're going to get
[03:42:43.800 --> 03:42:50.360]  clobbered uh my goodness let's go ahead and talk to uh Mel and Mass you're on the air with Richard
[03:42:50.360 --> 03:42:56.680]  Belzer and Alex Jones what a day to come on Richard I know I mean it's it's amazing go ahead
[03:42:56.680 --> 03:43:03.240]  Mel you're on the air from Mass where are you in Massachusetts uh I'm in uh the Worcester area uh
[03:43:03.240 --> 03:43:07.880]  I was watching I was actually out painting the house and I heard you you know just talk about
[03:43:07.880 --> 03:43:13.720]  the uh marathon and the explosion and I remember I was listening to how you said uh right away
[03:43:13.720 --> 03:43:19.880]  you know uh they they said it's the times we live in so I came in I flipped on the channel five
[03:43:19.880 --> 03:43:26.280]  and they described uh it's organized chaos I mean where we had that before and uh and then
[03:43:26.280 --> 03:43:30.040]  there now it's almost like they've been listening to your show because they're like well it's too
[03:43:30.040 --> 03:43:33.800]  early to say what's going on here no no it's already been going I'm gonna put you on hold
[03:43:34.440 --> 03:43:39.400]  guys rewind cnn right now rewind it to that the minute they're now saying they're now saying were
[03:43:39.400 --> 03:43:45.800]  their right wing or patriot meetings in the area uh-oh oh man and that's cnn doing that
[03:43:46.840 --> 03:43:53.880]  oh wolf blitzer we are in trouble oh man I bet they even dragged me into it with my 1776 line
[03:43:53.880 --> 03:44:04.440]  and boston I'm sorry Richard go ahead you're right it's all the symbolism boston the tea party
[03:44:04.440 --> 03:44:10.520]  patriots day so you know I was saying the whole earlier show that they're going to do a false
[03:44:10.520 --> 03:44:16.760]  flag and blame patriots and I just feel it and that because the caller said who loses is who
[03:44:16.760 --> 03:44:22.760]  shoots first like boston and I said yeah or bunker hill but I said yeah but they'll shoot first and
[03:44:22.760 --> 03:44:27.640]  say we did it you see what I'm saying they'll shoot first for us Richard yeah it's like hitler
[03:44:27.640 --> 03:44:32.360]  would kill polish soldiers and put german uniforms on them and drag them across the border and then
[03:44:32.360 --> 03:44:40.040]  invade the country exactly operation uh gliwitz which was part of operation hemler exactly oh
[03:44:40.040 --> 03:44:44.120]  man I'm sick of it boy I tell you let me ask you this rich I don't know if you believe in this
[03:44:44.840 --> 03:44:51.240]  has your spidey sense been off the chart lately just like your spidey sense you notice earlier
[03:44:51.240 --> 03:44:58.120]  in the day matt any special patriots day events going on any anything pointing to a special day
[03:44:58.120 --> 03:45:03.160]  in massachusetts well it's always a special day patriots day everyone gets the day off from work
[03:45:03.160 --> 03:45:08.040]  for the most part and it's two huge events in boston it's not only the boston marathon
[03:45:08.040 --> 03:45:13.240]  where 25 000 plus people run but I believe it's always opening day of fenway they also have that
[03:45:13.240 --> 03:45:18.280]  going on so it's a it's a traffic nightmare always but it's probably one of the busiest days
[03:45:18.280 --> 03:45:23.880]  in downtown boston so it is a holiday and people a lot of people don't go to work and there's no
[03:45:23.880 --> 03:45:29.320]  is there no school today either correct there's no school on patriots day in massachusetts
[03:45:29.320 --> 03:45:33.480]  so the kids are home they're watching either the marathon or they're watching the boston
[03:45:33.480 --> 03:45:39.560]  red sox play uh over at fenway park that game is now over uh and notice the bombing happened
[03:45:39.560 --> 03:45:45.000]  right where they've got the united nations display with a bunch of flags I'm telling you
[03:45:45.000 --> 03:45:49.240]  richard this is looking worse by the minute guys keep googling find out if anybody's taking
[03:45:49.240 --> 03:45:53.320]  responsibility for this yet this is now reach reto I'm sorry richard I asked you if your
[03:45:53.320 --> 03:45:57.960]  spidey sense was starting to tingle lately well I'm glad you asked me it's a good metaphor because
[03:45:57.960 --> 03:46:05.480]  uh I was in france for five weeks uh writing and I just turned off everything and I started getting
[03:46:05.480 --> 03:46:11.640]  I started getting depressed and I've not just for the Kennedy thing but just for the way what I've
[03:46:11.640 --> 03:46:18.120]  been learning about the degree to which the government really controls even more than I
[03:46:18.120 --> 03:46:24.360]  thought and I I'm you know I think I'm up to this uh up to date on it but it got darker and darker
[03:46:24.360 --> 03:46:28.840]  and I started sensing that something's going to happen in this country I don't know what it is
[03:46:29.560 --> 03:46:35.240]  it just seems it seemed inevitable and you know I I was you know usually when I go to France you
[03:46:35.240 --> 03:46:40.360]  know it's beautiful and I'm relaxed and but I was depressed there which I never get depressed there
[03:46:40.360 --> 03:46:44.920]  so you're right there I felt something portentous in the air I didn't know what it was I thought
[03:46:44.920 --> 03:46:51.400]  maybe because I'm studying Kennedy so much but I knew it was broader and bigger and this thing is
[03:46:51.400 --> 03:46:58.360]  just you know it's making me ill because they're going to use it no matter who did it exactly and
[03:46:58.360 --> 03:47:04.280]  it can blame it on muslims libertarians liberals who knows but but how dare how dare wolf blitzer
[03:47:04.280 --> 03:47:10.200]  pose a question like that that's directly from fort detrick I guarantee you to say was there
[03:47:10.200 --> 03:47:15.000]  any patriot groups why couldn't say there were any martians there were any aliens there that's
[03:47:15.000 --> 03:47:22.440]  a tell though that's a tell oh come on man I gotta get oh my god this this is red alert let's see
[03:47:22.440 --> 03:47:26.520]  what drudge is saying I'm gonna go back to the caller uh here and then I'll report on what drudge
[03:47:26.520 --> 03:47:31.480]  is saying with richard belzer two explosions developing report at least three dead okay bad
[03:47:31.480 --> 03:47:36.920]  news drudge report.com is reporting three dead people missing limbs yeah I've seen that video
[03:47:36.920 --> 03:47:41.480]  we've been showing it so be careful out there if you got your children with you explosions at
[03:47:41.480 --> 03:47:47.720]  boston marathon and then down here californians moved to ban and seized guns meanwhile with gold
[03:47:47.720 --> 03:47:55.800]  plunging uh what could this signify dow skids 200 oh my gosh oh my I'm telling you I told my
[03:47:55.800 --> 03:48:00.600]  wife this morning I've been I told the listeners when I went on there today I told the crew I can
[03:48:00.600 --> 03:48:07.640]  barely do this show I mean I I just every time it they're about to roll out some psyop and I'm not
[03:48:07.640 --> 03:48:13.480]  trying to get into mumbo jumbo here I just can't help it richard well no your antenna you're like
[03:48:13.480 --> 03:48:20.200]  me I mean my antenna has been buzzing for years but it seems to be getting red hot and all that
[03:48:20.200 --> 03:48:25.880]  constellation of events is occurring uh all at the same time now everything we feared it used to be
[03:48:25.880 --> 03:48:31.560]  a little here a little there but now you got you know busting the whistleblowers false flag events
[03:48:31.560 --> 03:48:38.920]  uh the drones uh you know putting troops in the street uh invading our privacy beyond our you
[03:48:38.920 --> 03:48:44.440]  know they do listen literally this is not an exaggeration they do listen literally to every
[03:48:44.440 --> 03:48:48.920]  single phone call in this country and they admit it now just six years ago bush got caught lying
[03:48:48.920 --> 03:48:53.160]  about it it was a scandal now it's like yeah we're doing we're watching everything yeah he said we
[03:48:53.160 --> 03:48:57.640]  have lawyers that you know said it was okay yeah let's go back to mel mel I apologize just that
[03:48:57.640 --> 03:49:02.200]  breaking news happened what do you think of wolf blitzer going oh it's patriot day was there any
[03:49:02.200 --> 03:49:08.840]  patriot events in the area I mean mel I'm telling you this is looking bad mel go ahead yeah I agree
[03:49:08.840 --> 03:49:16.600]  with you uh you know it's funny because I forgot today is patriot's day no it's the income tax day
[03:49:16.600 --> 03:49:22.520]  I think oh watch him blame an anti-income tax guy and notice they never actually bomb a real target
[03:49:22.520 --> 03:49:27.480]  it's always the general public so they can scare us and then act like anti-government groups would
[03:49:27.480 --> 03:49:33.640]  actually just target the general public go ahead yeah you know I agree with you on that and uh
[03:49:33.640 --> 03:49:38.840]  it's just funny you know like uh on 9 11 too I mean the planes came from Boston this is where
[03:49:38.840 --> 03:49:43.320]  they you know when we came across and left England this is where we started settling you know
[03:49:43.320 --> 03:49:49.320]  Plymouth rock and everything it's just uh I think it's very symbolic you know that's interesting
[03:49:49.320 --> 03:49:55.400]  that you mentioned that the planes took off in Boston how symbolic Boston is because the the
[03:49:55.400 --> 03:50:00.760]  guys who dressed up like native americans and threw boxes of tea in the water just came out of a
[03:50:01.560 --> 03:50:09.560]  mason meeting man I tell you that yeah the green dragon in or green dragon uh bar man I tell you
[03:50:09.560 --> 03:50:14.600]  this is just I'm almost speechless at this point I'm gonna have to regroup get the other crew in
[03:50:14.600 --> 03:50:17.720]  here after we take some more calls richer we'll get you out of here in about six seven minutes
[03:50:17.720 --> 03:50:23.720]  whatever we're about to go to break and I've got to go probably just lay down please I'm going to
[03:50:23.720 --> 03:50:28.440]  yeah yeah I know yeah I'm gonna just lay down reset and just try to you know because here's
