[00:00.000 --> 00:17.160]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[00:17.160 --> 00:26.200]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars dot-com studios it's Alex Jones
[00:26.200 --> 00:33.520]  breaking news alert almost no coverage of this even though it came out an hour
[00:33.520 --> 00:40.040]  ago in the Chicago Tribune Trump pardons ranchers the Hammons in case that
[00:40.040 --> 00:46.600]  inspired 2016 occupation of national wildlife refuge in Oregon amazing
[00:46.600 --> 00:51.680]  Trump's also set to go to England where the Islamists mayor city con is
[00:51.680 --> 00:56.960]  openly been calling for Trump to be blocked from the country simply simply
[00:56.960 --> 01:06.360]  amazing meanwhile with the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh we witness ABC news and
[01:06.360 --> 01:13.960]  others calling him a extreme candidate calling the controversial a candidate
[01:13.960 --> 01:19.160]  before his name had even been announced women's March also has been mocked for
[01:19.160 --> 01:25.600]  calling Supreme Court nominee xx and extremist in pre-written statement so
[01:25.600 --> 01:29.800]  they just said whoever it was that extreme quite frankly if anything
[01:29.800 --> 01:37.280]  Kavanaugh is a mainline Bush I type conservative who Trump sees as safe to
[01:37.280 --> 01:42.920]  get in and I trust the president so much and he hasn't proven it's wrong yet
[01:42.920 --> 01:47.200]  that even though I don't like the connection to Carl Rove I don't like
[01:47.200 --> 01:51.880]  the connection to never Trumpers the man does have a pretty good
[01:51.880 --> 01:57.600]  conservative voting record as a jurist and getting to see him up on the stage
[01:57.600 --> 02:02.200]  last night so you seem pretty genuine and he and Trump seem to have good
[02:02.200 --> 02:06.520]  chemistry and that's a lot of what Trump works with as well so we'll see
[02:06.520 --> 02:11.560]  what happens Barrett I think would have been better for so many reasons more
[02:11.560 --> 02:17.680]  conservative more Christian that at least interactions demonized for that and
[02:17.680 --> 02:23.320]  you've got Feinstein saying the dogma of Christianity is strong in you
[02:23.320 --> 02:30.680]  I'm excited strong with you so channeling Yoda it's an amazing time to be alive
[02:30.680 --> 02:34.960]  obviously we're gonna be looking at the Hammond case for those that forget
[02:34.960 --> 02:41.760]  there's a thing called controlled burns and everybody does it from upstate New
[02:41.760 --> 02:51.400]  York to Georgia to Florida to New Mexico to Texas to Illinois to Oregon and the
[02:51.400 --> 02:55.120]  Forest Service under Obama started saying you got to get permits for those
[02:55.120 --> 02:59.760]  and then they wouldn't issue them and so these brothers did some controlled
[02:59.760 --> 03:05.160]  burns right on their property line as a fire break because the Park Service is
[03:05.160 --> 03:08.400]  famous for not clearing that out now and then there's a fire it builds up
[03:08.400 --> 03:13.280]  super heat and comes on your land and a little bit of it like a half acre or
[03:13.280 --> 03:20.000]  something in the control burn burn some forest bottom area burn some grass and
[03:20.000 --> 03:27.240]  they put them in prison for it and called it arson so anybody that's lived in
[03:27.240 --> 03:32.120]  Texas you know every year after the summer's over the Mexicans burn their
[03:32.120 --> 03:36.120]  fields to put nitrogen back into it it's whatever it's cultures done for
[03:36.120 --> 03:39.840]  thousands of years and there's a lot of smoke in the sky sometimes it makes you
[03:39.840 --> 03:42.960]  cough sometimes you know the makes the sun sets incredibly beautiful are we
[03:42.960 --> 03:48.000]  gonna arrest all the Mexicans for doing it it's what you do but beyond that it's
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.080]  a firebreak so Trump is pardon ranchers who arrest led to armed occupation of
[03:53.080 --> 03:58.440]  wildlife refuge he is not pardoned the Bundy's yet but they've been winning
[03:58.440 --> 04:02.360]  their court cases but have been through living hell now obviously got set up by
[04:02.360 --> 04:05.320]  some informants and others but that has just been a real nightmare and we saw
[04:05.320 --> 04:09.000]  journalists like Pete Santelli you I don't think broken he lost being thrown
[04:09.000 --> 04:13.440]  in prison for years and then finally being able to get out it's it's it's been
[04:13.440 --> 04:18.920]  a bad situation and then to have paramilitary there with the FBI shoot an
[04:18.920 --> 04:25.240]  unarmed man mr. Finnegan it's it's been quite the devilish fiasco and could have
[04:25.240 --> 04:30.520]  sparked a new wayco type siege but thank God that got de-escalated and Trump's
[04:30.520 --> 04:34.760]  trying to get the Forest Service and the Park Service the BLM really as we're
[04:34.760 --> 04:40.120]  talking about stop acting like Soviet thugs so that's all coming up today plus

[06:10.080 --> 06:12.520]  resistance
[06:29.160 --> 06:34.000]  ladies and gentlemen we are live broadcasting worldwide I am your host
[06:34.000 --> 06:41.920]  Alex Jones and Trump has just hardened the Hammond brothers the foresters and
[06:41.920 --> 06:49.400]  cattle ranchers in Oregon who did a controlled legal and lawful burn right
[06:49.400 --> 06:53.280]  along their property line with the US Forest Service quote property and
[06:53.280 --> 06:59.800]  because a small amount of land burned a little bit of grass and undercover a
[06:59.800 --> 07:04.200]  foliage under the trees they were sentenced to a long prison sentence
[07:04.200 --> 07:10.800]  sparking the outrage and the standoff that then develop I think it's a very
[07:10.800 --> 07:17.520]  very good move you could argue that a pardon of the bundies would only spark
[07:17.520 --> 07:23.560]  more people to have armed confrontations but you cannot argue that this was a
[07:23.560 --> 07:29.040]  very good pardon that said I think the bindi should be pardoned because the
[07:29.040 --> 07:33.200]  feds came and took their land they took their cattle to starve them to death and
[07:33.200 --> 07:36.760]  then live the media and says it wasn't their land because the public didn't
[07:36.760 --> 07:43.400]  understand surface rights versus who has the actual title to it but when you're
[07:43.400 --> 07:49.280]  there since 1877 and you have the grazing rights those are the rights and you
[07:49.280 --> 07:53.960]  just can't take them there were hundreds of families there now there is one
[07:53.960 --> 08:00.280]  family there we don't need more people run off the land in this UN
[08:00.280 --> 08:06.760]  rewilding program of UNESCO George Herbert Walker Bush in 1992 shine us
[08:06.760 --> 08:13.800]  on to that thing put our schools our immigration program our land use
[08:13.800 --> 08:18.640]  everything under the UN and people would say oh the crazy conspiracy theorist
[08:18.640 --> 08:25.080]  they say we're under the UN because we were remember what Trump did last year
[08:25.080 --> 08:30.920]  he said the UN no longer runs our refugee program we're gonna decide who
[08:30.920 --> 08:37.040]  comes in via ice and via the Constitution I'm retaking recapturing
[08:37.040 --> 08:41.160]  the power the president has under the Constitution and of course the Supreme
[08:41.160 --> 08:47.120]  Court unanimously years later said it was right because the president has that
[08:47.120 --> 08:50.000]  power it's in the Constitution a five-year-old could read that understand
[08:50.000 --> 08:56.600]  it how had it been transferred to the UN the UN would say who can come in the
[08:56.600 --> 09:00.680]  UN would vet the people of course they weren't vetting them who runs the
[09:00.680 --> 09:06.320]  refugee program in Europe the UN if a international unelected body can tell
[09:06.320 --> 09:10.320]  you who you take in and how your borders are operating you are under global
[09:10.320 --> 09:16.240]  government and they will use those third world populations as weapons so I
[09:16.240 --> 09:28.600]  bring that up to remind folks that the UN with the EU as we speak is telling
[09:28.600 --> 09:35.120]  Europe that they are bringing in the United Nations the EU is bringing in
[09:35.120 --> 09:40.440]  the United Nations to establish quote refugee centers those are invasion
[09:40.440 --> 09:47.840]  centers and the EU is now creating a Navy to block Italy from blocking George
[09:47.840 --> 09:53.240]  Soros chartered ships coming out of Africa daily with thousands well guess
[09:53.240 --> 09:56.840]  what that just made Italy start to vote to leave the EU oh but here's the
[09:56.840 --> 10:01.360]  problem there's a permanent bureaucracy and just as Italy never voted to enter
[10:01.360 --> 10:05.640]  the unelected EU and just as the UK never voted to do it even though they
[10:05.640 --> 10:12.480]  voted for Brexit two years ago Theresa May and that's coming up upon what Joseph
[10:12.480 --> 10:18.120]  Watson report at the bottom of the hour tried to sign a deal unilaterally
[10:18.120 --> 10:24.040]  putting them back in the EU but see people say well if we vote to leave or
[10:24.040 --> 10:27.080]  we vote to get out of these criminal programs why they just keep coming back
[10:27.080 --> 10:31.600]  but then people are awake and a set of denying we're under the UN and denying
[10:31.600 --> 10:35.920]  we're under world government when you get a real president or you get a real
[10:35.920 --> 10:39.680]  party like UKIP and you get real movements in Europe pointing out that
[10:39.680 --> 10:45.520]  no one ever voted to enter this and the EU bureaucracy is permanent and the
[10:45.520 --> 10:51.440]  parliament is ceremonial and then the the EU bureaucrats all hundred and
[10:51.440 --> 10:56.760]  something thousand of them voted to give themselves diplomatic immunity a
[10:56.760 --> 11:07.680]  decade ago and tax exemption from the EU wide raft of taxes like VAT and others
[11:07.680 --> 11:13.560]  I mean you can't float that and get away with it what have I said thousands of
[11:13.560 --> 11:20.000]  times if you expose the authoritarian nature of the global government EU UN
[11:20.000 --> 11:25.960]  IMF World Bank global combine set up by the Rockefellers is 70 years ago if you
[11:25.960 --> 11:32.560]  look at it it's totally flagrantly illegal it's flagrantly tyrannical it's
[11:32.560 --> 11:39.760]  just naked it's prima facie on its face it is total corporate world
[11:39.760 --> 11:47.000]  government by stealth and you ask well how do we defeat that because they've
[11:47.000 --> 11:55.400]  got all the money they swindled it all of course and every tech owner like
[11:55.400 --> 12:01.840]  Bezos and all of them cook all of them worth hundreds of billions of piece
[12:01.840 --> 12:08.200]  control trillions are the most ruthless monsters with slave factories and forced
[12:08.200 --> 12:14.000]  abortions and the daycare at Foxconn in China if people chain their kids up and
[12:14.000 --> 12:19.400]  they crap on the street I'm not kidding look it up no environmental standards
[12:19.400 --> 12:23.280]  no nothing and then they put more standards on us than anybody else so
[12:23.280 --> 12:27.080]  that we can't operate and Trump's like we're not doing this anymore and here's
[12:27.080 --> 12:32.920]  the other breaking news the Hill is reporting lawmakers target Chinese
[12:32.920 --> 12:39.520]  security companies over spy fears Congress is now investigating the fact
[12:39.520 --> 12:43.400]  that most major Chinese companies are run by members of Chinese intelligence
[12:43.400 --> 12:46.680]  that our major universities have been openly been taken over by them that
[12:46.680 --> 12:49.760]  they've done the office of personal management hack that Obama gave them all
[12:49.760 --> 12:56.240]  the codes the realization that we've been totally infiltrated by the red
[12:56.240 --> 13:04.480]  Chinese military and that they brag about it and that they have put bases all
[13:04.480 --> 13:09.920]  over the world under the guise of factories and mines and that they are
[13:09.920 --> 13:18.680]  intending to cut the US off economically and militarily and that our own so-called
[13:18.680 --> 13:25.400]  elites 100% took China from what they didn't have running water in 99% of the
[13:25.400 --> 13:33.800]  country and people wipe their air ends with their hands and let Mao kill 80
[13:33.800 --> 13:37.240]  something million people to get them in line take them in line them up the
[13:37.240 --> 13:42.000]  slaves and then total Western investment to leverage out the planet
[13:42.000 --> 13:49.760]  China was wood-burning stoves in no toilet paper 60 years ago now it's got
[13:49.760 --> 13:54.480]  more roads more industry than the United States has we have been totally
[13:54.480 --> 14:04.680]  ripped screwed over absolutely militarily through economics destroyed
[14:04.680 --> 14:08.240]  look at the headline right here it's on drudgerport.com it's also up on
[14:08.240 --> 14:17.440]  info wars.com and it deals with new record trade deficit with China
[14:17.440 --> 14:21.560]  Trump is just trying to put a tourniquet on our leg that's been chopped off at
[14:21.560 --> 14:28.640]  the knee for 50 years the blood's been spraying out and finally was just kind
[14:28.640 --> 14:32.360]  of barely coming out really almost a need for a tourniquet except we're
[14:32.360 --> 14:34.920]  doing blood transfusions right now that's what Trump's doing he's got the
[14:34.920 --> 14:39.360]  country off-life support blood transfusions trying to get us to eat our
[14:39.360 --> 14:43.560]  first meal trying to get some color back in our skin and trying to get us up
[14:43.560 --> 14:48.000]  and positive and realizing we're in a fight because they use our open free
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.480]  society traders in our own government multinational banks to bring the United
[14:52.480 --> 14:56.120]  States down at the end of World War two they said the US dominates the planet
[14:56.120 --> 14:58.920]  it's got half the wealth it's got everything it's promoting freedom
[14:58.920 --> 15:04.600]  worldwide we can't have that let's promote a form of corporate communism and
[15:04.600 --> 15:10.440]  let's prop China up in a big master plan to do it and so all of you anti for

[20:02.520 --> 20:07.920]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:07.920 --> 20:25.600]  you keep saying you've got something for me
[20:25.600 --> 20:33.480]  something you call love but confessed you've been a messing where you
[20:33.480 --> 20:41.560]  shouldn't have been a messing and now someone else is getting all your best
[20:41.560 --> 20:48.960]  these boots are made for walking and that's just what they do one of these
[20:48.960 --> 20:57.400]  days these boots are gonna walk all over you and the old establishment left is
[20:57.400 --> 21:04.360]  crapping their bridges right now they don't know what to do America you keep
[21:04.360 --> 21:09.600]  lying when you ought to be true and the West is fighting for its life and you
[21:09.600 --> 21:15.520]  keep losing when you ought to not bet and we're starting to win you keep
[21:15.520 --> 21:20.200]  saying when you ought to be a change in it's right you ought to be changing now
[21:20.200 --> 21:25.400]  what's right is right but you ain't been right yet but they're not changing and
[21:25.400 --> 21:32.280]  they haven't been right yet where does communism or socialism work
[21:32.280 --> 21:37.040]  nowhere except for a tiny one-tenth to one percent that always gets total
[21:37.040 --> 21:42.760]  power so I'm gonna just keep on walking with the truth with history on my side
[21:42.760 --> 21:47.560]  all over you tyrants get used to it
[21:47.560 --> 21:56.240]  they prime example of that which is some really good unintentional humor
[21:56.240 --> 22:04.800]  Pelosi dims must win midterms to preserve civilization as everyone runs
[22:04.800 --> 22:13.760]  from blue cities and blue states all over the world I know it's a red blue
[22:13.760 --> 22:19.040]  dichotomy the media came up with decades ago for their map boards during
[22:19.040 --> 22:23.720]  elections but you look globally and call it's kind of upside down world but call
[22:23.720 --> 22:28.880]  free market countries red and socialist or communist countries blue even though
[22:28.880 --> 22:36.800]  communist colors red everyone's running from the blue towards the red aren't
[22:36.800 --> 22:47.000]  they but then the left always tells you they are civilization there's always
[22:47.000 --> 22:53.120]  propaganda about spaceships and science and everything but they can't do any
[22:53.120 --> 23:01.920]  thing they can't get their act together and as the economy comes roaring back
[23:01.920 --> 23:08.040]  they now admit they're trying to sabotage it to stop Trump so I'm gonna go
[23:08.040 --> 23:12.240]  over some of the amazing economic numbers here in just a moment but also
[23:12.240 --> 23:17.440]  look at the poison lining to this if we don't long term and even the midterm
[23:17.440 --> 23:24.960]  fix things but this is Trump walking all over them with Brett Kavanaugh here he
[23:24.960 --> 23:30.520]  is making the announcement last night tonight it is my honor and privilege to
[23:30.520 --> 23:39.040]  announce that I will nominate judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States
[23:39.040 --> 23:44.320]  judge Kavanaugh has impeccable credentials unsurpassed qualifications
[23:44.320 --> 23:50.600]  and a proven commitment to equal justice under the law the Supreme Court is
[23:50.600 --> 23:56.920]  entrusted with the safeguard of the crown jewel of our republic the
[23:56.920 --> 24:03.880]  Constitution of the United States the rule of law is our nation's proud heritage
[24:03.880 --> 24:12.000]  it is the cornerstone of our freedom it is what guarantees equal justice and the
[24:12.000 --> 24:19.080]  Senate now has the chance to protect this glorious heritage by sending judge
[24:19.080 --> 24:26.320]  Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court people are asking me what
[24:26.320 --> 24:31.600]  I think of this I'm usually right and a lot of insiders thought that Kavanaugh
[24:31.600 --> 24:34.840]  was out because of Rand Paul because the Bush connections but his voting
[24:34.840 --> 24:40.680]  records actually pretty conservative and Trump likes him and Trump knows other
[24:40.680 --> 24:51.200]  people that know him and he is well suited to probably win confirmation the
[24:51.200 --> 24:55.560]  problem is and I'm gonna get into this right now the Democrats have announced
[24:55.560 --> 24:58.760]  their plan it hasn't gotten a lot of traction yet but they've announced their
[24:58.760 --> 25:03.200]  plan to try to block him and their argument is we're gonna block everybody
[25:03.200 --> 25:08.360]  because Trump is under investigation and so therefore it's a conflict of
[25:08.360 --> 25:14.280]  interest if he puts the Supreme Court justice in who might then sit over
[25:14.280 --> 25:21.520]  judgment of him well by that extension he couldn't have the last guy either if
[25:21.520 --> 25:24.600]  you know about separation of powers that's how you balance this out then
[25:24.600 --> 25:29.960]  oh the president does get his Supreme Court nominees he does get to pick them
[25:29.960 --> 25:36.280]  he does get to put them forward and then when they get in they will sit in
[25:36.280 --> 25:40.160]  judgment that's how it works you just can't have the legislative over the
[25:40.160 --> 25:43.680]  executive or the executive of the legislative or the judicial over it's
[25:43.680 --> 25:49.640]  it's separate but equal class and it's very very clear but now they're playing
[25:49.640 --> 25:53.960]  this game Politico has an article out what Trump's Supreme Court pick means
[25:53.960 --> 26:00.200]  for the Russia probe and you've got these different congressmen different
[26:00.200 --> 26:04.920]  senators like Corey Booker saying President Trump is currently a subject
[26:04.920 --> 26:08.600]  of an ongoing criminal investigation and any nomination of a Supreme Court
[26:08.600 --> 26:12.080]  justice all investigation continues is unacceptable because of the clear
[26:12.080 --> 26:15.320]  conflicts you just can't have anybody now see trying to sell that idea of
[26:15.320 --> 26:19.720]  interest inherent the president installing someone installing someone
[26:19.720 --> 26:24.760]  no no they are approved by Congress who could be deciding vote on the number
[26:24.760 --> 26:27.720]  of potential issues for the investigation that could come before the court
[26:27.720 --> 26:33.600]  senator Corey Booker said in a statement opposing Kavanaugh's nomination now
[26:33.600 --> 26:38.840]  where's the inherent fraud there because it's the Supreme Court justice is
[26:38.840 --> 26:43.320]  appointed by Democrats that sit over Democrats that's how the separation of
[26:43.320 --> 26:47.320]  powers works so one group doesn't get full control and overthrow the whole
[26:47.320 --> 26:50.920]  system which is what the Democrats have been trying to do for decades and
[26:50.920 --> 26:57.560]  globalism is a world system to overturn nation-states period they're the
[26:57.560 --> 27:00.680]  traders that hate America they hate flyover country they hate the bitter
[27:00.680 --> 27:03.840]  clingers they hate the second amendment they hate the Christians they've
[27:03.840 --> 27:07.360]  declared their hatred of this country they've declared their hatred of this
[27:07.360 --> 27:15.440]  country's economy they are the clear and present danger they're the enemy and if
[27:15.440 --> 27:19.320]  anything Kavanaugh's association with the Republican establishment means he
[27:19.320 --> 27:25.240]  might not be trustworthy for Trump but Trump has done nothing he's our
[27:25.240 --> 27:29.960]  president he could go sign any deal he wanted with Russia because he's the
[27:29.960 --> 27:33.760]  president then if Congress thought it was bad and thought it had political
[27:33.760 --> 27:37.360]  support of the people they could impeach him for it but he can do whatever he
[27:37.360 --> 27:43.480]  wants there's no prior restraint that's that's why put the president in is very
[27:43.480 --> 27:50.240]  important and a sacred duty when you're the big global empire but see the
[27:50.240 --> 27:55.360]  globalists have had us build the empire and now they wanted to remove America
[27:55.360 --> 28:00.600]  from the equation controlling the empire so Trump's gonna meet Theresa May
[28:00.600 --> 28:03.400]  coming up here in just a few days that's gonna be a circus he's been meeting
[28:03.400 --> 28:09.400]  with Putin and Trump has found his sea legs he's winning on every front and the
[28:09.400 --> 28:13.360]  globalists are panicking and don't know what to do and it's a beautiful time to
[28:13.360 --> 28:16.440]  be alive right now but when we come back I'm gonna play some more of these
[28:16.440 --> 28:23.320]  clips I've got Paul Watson's report on the attempts to keep the UK in the EU
[28:23.320 --> 28:27.840]  with no vote in fact countermanding another vote but what I'm saying about
[28:27.840 --> 28:33.600]  Trump is this the will of the people are behind him and so when he made the
[28:33.600 --> 28:36.800]  joke I could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and my supporters and will still
[28:36.800 --> 28:41.240]  support me he gets the fact that he's gonna deliver to us we're gonna deliver
[28:41.240 --> 28:45.480]  to him and that's why I'm so behind the president because we're taking the
[28:45.480 --> 28:49.280]  country in the world back and the globalists are crapping their pants and
[28:49.280 --> 28:53.600]  things are turning around so praise God's all I got to say that mean things
[28:53.600 --> 28:58.560]  are perfect but in my gut I know Trump's good as well
[28:58.560 --> 29:04.040]  I tried other brands but I came back to my sunshine for the best hot or cold pain

[33:19.120 --> 33:36.160]  lines of the info war here's why I'm so pro Trump here's why I endorsed him for
[33:36.160 --> 33:44.000]  president early on if I can smell fate I can see future paths that I want to
[33:44.000 --> 33:54.240]  follow that I want my family to be part of that's what a leader is now the
[33:54.240 --> 33:58.040]  globalist hate Trump they hate nationalist movements they hate free
[33:58.040 --> 34:02.040]  market because they've already gotten control of the planet's wealth and they
[34:02.040 --> 34:07.040]  don't want you to have any wealth because they want total power over you total
[34:07.040 --> 34:17.880]  control and Trump has been deathly guiding this country back from the
[34:17.880 --> 34:22.640]  brink and when you look at how the communist Chinese even in the Washington
[34:22.640 --> 34:33.520]  Post they admit have taken over America's top 50 public schools with just
[34:33.520 --> 34:44.360]  billions coming in and directly setting up endowments taking control and our
[34:44.360 --> 34:48.520]  government stood by and let him do it because it was part of a master plan oh
[34:48.520 --> 34:52.600]  here's the Panama Canal here's all the major deep water ports here's all our
[34:52.600 --> 35:00.880]  missile secrets and then they put their army officers and their air force
[35:00.880 --> 35:09.400]  officers and their Navy officers into the schools I've been doing it for decades
[35:09.400 --> 35:14.240]  to be students and then they end up being the heads of the schools the heads
[35:14.240 --> 35:18.640]  of the science programs and it's in the Hill newspaper today that Congress is
[35:18.640 --> 35:23.160]  having hearings on this lawmakers target Chinese security companies over
[35:23.160 --> 35:31.240]  spy fears we have been sold out this was the next world war this was the
[35:31.240 --> 35:37.000]  global corporate war to bring down Europe bring down the E the the United
[35:37.000 --> 35:43.160]  Kingdom using the EU this is the stealth program and it's admitted and it's
[35:43.160 --> 35:50.400]  diabolical and it can say but it happened and so all of you that hate
[35:50.400 --> 35:55.000]  Trump and hate America well you've never been to China you've never been to
[35:55.000 --> 35:58.640]  Venezuela you've never studied it you have no idea what I'm even talking
[35:58.640 --> 36:05.520]  about you just hate Trump because he's a Nazi because late night TV said so
[36:05.520 --> 36:15.320]  500 times and what you've got is a bunch of spoiled rotten brainwashed
[36:15.320 --> 36:22.680]  sniveling prindies who have this whole birthright right in front of them and
[36:22.680 --> 36:28.760]  they want to just crap it away because in some feeble area of their mind they
[36:28.760 --> 36:34.000]  think they're on this big international global intellectual team because
[36:34.000 --> 36:39.760]  their high school teachers and their college professors patted them on the
[36:39.760 --> 36:44.320]  head and said you're good look Hollywood and mainstream media and the
[36:44.320 --> 36:51.040]  chai comms and the unelected EU and the islamicist mayors they all said oh
[36:51.040 --> 36:59.760]  you're so smart let's launch a big fat Trump baby balloon and then have the
[36:59.760 --> 37:11.840]  media report on it 10 million times and celebrate it in some stupid ritual when
[37:11.840 --> 37:20.120]  that baby with the clothespin diaper on just beat your whole global system
[37:20.120 --> 37:25.400]  rallying humanity and the West is coming back and that's all you've got to
[37:25.400 --> 37:32.600]  offer that won't bother Trump he loves going to the correspondence dinner
[37:32.600 --> 37:36.640]  before he got elected president having them call him a loser and saying you'll
[37:36.640 --> 37:47.080]  never be president and you're a you're a piece of garbage because Trump knew he
[37:47.080 --> 37:52.960]  who laughs last wins because he has an internal compass just like I do just like
[37:52.960 --> 37:57.280]  our listeners do where we're not governed by peer pressure we're not
[37:57.280 --> 38:02.800]  governed by the winds of propaganda we're governed by our inner rudder our
[38:02.800 --> 38:07.800]  compass and it's what drives us what we know is right what we know is true
[38:07.800 --> 38:17.360]  integrity and by the way with integrity comes incredible wealth incredible
[38:17.360 --> 38:26.880]  success incredible power the problem is you ever experience family or neighbors
[38:26.880 --> 38:32.320]  that don't really have a job and but boy they sure want to tell you how to run
[38:32.320 --> 38:36.800]  your life they sure want to tell you what to do with your car they sure want to
[38:36.800 --> 38:47.120]  tell you how you should live because they don't have a life they want to run
[38:47.120 --> 38:55.200]  your life and they think calling us names lying about us pouring coffee on us
[38:55.200 --> 39:00.200]  yelling and screaming at us does something yes it does something it lets
[39:00.200 --> 39:07.320]  me know I'm right about how immature and stupid and thuggish and mob mentality
[39:07.320 --> 39:16.520]  you people are and it means nothing to me what you do and what you say when I
[39:16.520 --> 39:20.240]  was in Seattle they'd always run by and call me a Nazi or call me a name so to
[39:20.240 --> 39:23.200]  wave them over and say tell me what you have to say tell me your intellectual
[39:23.200 --> 39:33.800]  ideas and their answer would be to throw coffee on me and run away
[39:36.920 --> 39:45.120]  and even when I offered the goblin as we call him $10,000 and first class
[39:45.120 --> 39:51.200]  tickets to come here he wouldn't do it when we upped it to $20,000 it turns
[39:51.200 --> 39:58.560]  out he is an out-of-work wannabe professional wrestler announcer it
[39:58.560 --> 40:08.440]  turns out that the goblin cannot and will not debate and neither can his
[40:08.440 --> 40:15.560]  Brian Stelter style teeth like he crossed Brian Stelter and Mr. Edd and
[40:15.560 --> 40:24.480]  then threw in golem with a genetic chimera and then out popped this guy I'm
[40:24.480 --> 40:31.440]  not trying to be mean it's just what is it about minions of this system that
[40:31.440 --> 40:36.320]  make them so horrific to look at okay I gotta stop I really want to play this
[40:36.320 --> 40:39.920]  Brexit report we come back to the next segment and we've got Mark Rondaza one

[41:18.320 --> 41:22.040]  everybody does who understands that you've got to have fire breaks and so
[41:22.040 --> 41:27.320]  they call that arson and put them in prison for that so that is a big deal

[43:04.640 --> 43:09.000]  here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water
[43:09.000 --> 43:14.440]  and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain
[43:14.440 --> 43:18.920]  heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to
[43:18.920 --> 43:24.000]  unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[43:24.000 --> 43:29.360]  alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels
[43:29.360 --> 43:34.280]  of heavy metals and acidity in the rain water next we tested the water from our
[43:34.280 --> 43:38.920]  Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe
[43:38.920 --> 43:45.000]  measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the
[43:45.000 --> 43:49.680]  filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what we've learned is
[43:49.680 --> 43:54.760]  that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more
[43:54.760 --> 44:00.200]  importantly a good water filtration system will purify it as the years go

[47:47.640 --> 47:53.360]  mainstream media I guess you call them the the suckers the weak-minded people
[47:53.360 --> 48:00.200]  are physically attacking people running people out of stores rioting screaming
[48:00.200 --> 48:03.720]  freaking out all over the country there's just so many reports of it I can't
[48:03.720 --> 48:08.600]  even keep track of it a lot of it's up on infowars.com antifoshes beating up
[48:08.600 --> 48:13.040]  anybody that's got a bumper sticker that's Christian on their cars other
[48:13.040 --> 48:17.600]  there's so much of this pouring in there we've got three new videos of them
[48:17.600 --> 48:22.360]  just beating up old women and let me tell you something I see like 15 young
[48:22.360 --> 48:27.600]  punks beating up a 65 70 year old woman and I'm gonna be honest I just start
[48:27.600 --> 48:33.280]  wanting to kill people I just as a man I can't watch that stuff because it
[48:33.280 --> 48:38.160]  makes me angry at everybody around me I'm not trying to sound like a tough guy
[48:38.160 --> 48:47.960]  either man how do you come up with grown men beating up old women I mean that's
[48:47.960 --> 48:55.560]  why I cannot get around this stuff I just this country has produced so much
[48:55.560 --> 49:01.040]  good but it's also produced a bunch of spoiled rotten scum that is the lowest
[49:01.040 --> 49:06.920]  filth on the earth I mean I would just love to see each one of these punks
[49:06.920 --> 49:10.880]  putting a ring with a patriot
[49:13.520 --> 49:17.480]  just stop stop showing it to me that's just one of the videos I can't look at
[49:17.480 --> 49:22.960]  it but I've seen it myself where they'll target an old dude on crutches or an old
[49:22.960 --> 49:26.960]  lady on a wheelchair just like radical Islamists you see the videos where
[49:26.960 --> 49:34.200]  they'll kick women downstairs and stuff it's it's just they are so dishonorable
[49:34.200 --> 49:40.880]  they are so cowardly they are so weak that it's hard to believe that there is
[49:40.880 --> 49:45.880]  scum like this and that it exists but it does exist and it is a creation a
[49:45.880 --> 49:52.400]  dropping of the Nancy Pelosi's of Hillary of the San Francisco's of the
[49:52.400 --> 49:57.240]  Seattle's of Austin much of Austin has fallen to it I've not evacuated but my
[49:57.240 --> 50:06.080]  god it is a product of loathsome evil that must be met head on but I asked
[50:06.080 --> 50:13.320]  men out there if you watch grown men run up and a woman beg them and say free
[50:13.320 --> 50:17.880]  speech and they smack her in the face and the police do nothing of course
[50:17.880 --> 50:22.760]  there's always these weird little potbellied Nelly police in San Francisco
[50:22.760 --> 50:27.240]  a little you know that smile when they see it it's like what planet did you
[50:27.240 --> 50:33.760]  come from because you don't act like people now we're going to Roger Stone
[50:33.760 --> 50:36.840]  right now I'll get to the Paul Watson big Briggs it knows the start of the next
[50:36.840 --> 50:43.400]  hour because I want to get into the the pardon and obviously what's behind
[50:43.400 --> 50:47.000]  these things the president exercising executive power people haven't been doing
[50:47.000 --> 50:51.160]  that except exercising it for the globalist now it's being an exercise
[50:51.160 --> 50:56.560]  for America I love it but clever cutting him's written an article the
[50:56.560 --> 51:00.760]  Palatano says Kavanaugh heart and soul of the establishment and then he's
[51:00.760 --> 51:10.400]  disappointed and then it then that that that Justice Gourish was a good pick
[51:10.400 --> 51:15.720]  and was honorable and I respect Andrew and Palatano and of course one of the
[51:15.720 --> 51:19.480]  best friends of Roger Stone and I had one of the editors walk in and said do you
[51:19.480 --> 51:22.600]  want to publish this and they normally let me ask me something about something
[51:22.600 --> 51:26.280]  get sued for it and I might have lawyers review it but I said of course
[51:26.280 --> 51:29.840]  publish it I like Clifford cutting him he works for us and I said I want to hear
[51:29.840 --> 51:33.200]  what the Palatano has to say we're gonna show both sides we're not in a cult here
[51:33.200 --> 51:40.760]  but here is my view and we'll go to Roger Stone if Trump can co-opt the
[51:40.760 --> 51:48.680]  establishment then I'm all for it we want them to surrender and one way to do
[51:48.680 --> 51:52.800]  that is to bring them in and then see if they'll be honorable if not you throw
[51:52.800 --> 51:56.720]  him overboard that's what Trump does with the Supreme Court pick though this
[51:56.720 --> 52:02.400]  guy will be there 30 40 years he's pretty young you can't do that and so
[52:02.400 --> 52:05.280]  that's why it's a big deal so the left doesn't want him they're gonna oppose
[52:05.280 --> 52:08.480]  anybody saying the president's under investigation so conflict of interest
[52:08.480 --> 52:11.680]  totally unconstitutional to say that it's just made up but that's gonna be
[52:11.680 --> 52:14.840]  their big push when they surround the Capitol and you know they're calling
[52:14.840 --> 52:21.960]  for a civil insurrection but I know this I've seen the president so many times
[52:21.960 --> 52:27.320]  come through that I trust him and I didn't want Kavanaugh Roger didn't want
[52:27.320 --> 52:31.640]  him Senator Paul sitting was probably going to vote against him now he says
[52:31.640 --> 52:35.120]  he's open which means there's been some behind-the-scenes discussion has
[52:35.120 --> 52:38.960]  Kavanaugh pledged himself the Republic has he explained hey I just came up
[52:38.960 --> 52:42.440]  through the system and Harvard and Yale okay I'm a white shoe boy but you know
[52:42.440 --> 52:45.680]  I'll probably get confirmed and he's got a pretty good voting record he's got
[52:45.680 --> 52:49.800]  some a few problems on civil liberties so that's my view is that the president
[52:49.800 --> 52:53.720]  isn't God he can't do everything he knows a lot of things we don't know the
[52:53.720 --> 52:57.020]  globalist absolutely hate him we need to get this confirmation before the mid
[52:57.020 --> 52:59.800]  terms in case they steal those and they're gonna try to impeach the
[52:59.800 --> 53:03.240]  president and they're gonna make a big move in the Supreme Court so I see what
[53:03.240 --> 53:08.560]  the president is doing sometimes he's proven right sometimes he's proven
[53:08.560 --> 53:13.680]  wrong most of the time he's proven right roger stone what do you think well I
[53:13.680 --> 53:18.600]  agree with you Alex he was not my choice I'm not saying that he is not a
[53:18.600 --> 53:24.520]  conservative he is but at the same time his deep ties to the establishment and
[53:24.520 --> 53:30.120]  to the bush family were troubling to me whether or not his involvement as a
[53:30.120 --> 53:36.000]  young prosecutor in the Vince Foster case the Clinton's lawyer who was you
[53:36.000 --> 53:42.120]  know died in office comes up in his confirmations remains to be seen the
[53:42.120 --> 53:46.920]  left would have opposed anybody Trump appointed they had their fill in the
[53:46.920 --> 53:51.280]  blank signs already painted so they would have been just as by the way
[53:51.280 --> 53:55.000]  there's actual video they had all the signs of all four potentials printed up
[53:55.000 --> 53:59.480]  and that ABC News beforehand said controversial nominee before it was
[53:59.480 --> 54:04.720]  even announced yeah so you know they were locked and loaded regardless of
[54:04.720 --> 54:11.520]  where the president went let's see how this goes the left is also claiming that
[54:11.520 --> 54:15.560]  the president wanted Kavanaugh because he thinks there's going to be a showdown
[54:15.560 --> 54:20.120]  in the Supreme Court over the investigation by Robert Mueller and
[54:20.120 --> 54:26.240]  whether or not the president can be subpoenaed to give a deposition perhaps
[54:26.240 --> 54:31.160]  even broader issues I don't know that that's the case but that is the narrative
[54:31.160 --> 54:35.080]  being spun by the left oh they're now saying he's not allowed to have any
[54:35.080 --> 54:40.440]  nominees that that the previous one that he got in is bad I mean of course
[54:40.440 --> 54:44.200]  it's not in the Constitution it's not true there's separate equal powers but
[54:44.200 --> 54:48.600]  that is going to be their new push that Senator Booker and others are pushing is
[54:48.600 --> 54:52.200]  that Trump just must be shut down his whole agenda because he's under
[54:52.200 --> 54:58.680]  investigation by their little crackpot Mueller who's been totally exposed yeah
[54:58.680 --> 55:02.880]  it's it's really kind of extraordinary clearly these people have never read the
[55:02.880 --> 55:07.400]  US Constitution the president has the authority to make these appointments and
[55:07.400 --> 55:14.520]  he should do so on an on a timely basis you can see that Ruth Bader Ginsburg is
[55:14.520 --> 55:19.120]  holding on to see whether the Democrats win the Senate this November she's
[55:19.120 --> 55:25.000]  hanging on by a thread so everything the Democrats say now is colored by their
[55:25.000 --> 55:30.880]  growing hysteria over the popularity and success of the president the growing
[55:30.880 --> 55:36.880]  economy really has them spooked because it gives the president the upper hand and
[55:36.880 --> 55:40.000]  that was my next point and we'll cover it some we come back here in a few minutes
[55:40.000 --> 55:45.200]  Pelosi dims must win midterms reserve civilization but everyone's running from
[55:45.200 --> 55:49.760]  blue cities blue states and socialists in communist countries Texas the CNBC's
[55:49.760 --> 55:54.240]  top state for business in America this year the coming labor shortage in
[55:54.240 --> 55:59.280]  America is great for news for workers with wages rising rapidly without the
[55:59.280 --> 56:04.440]  communist minimum wage which bankrupts things lowest ever Hispanic
[56:04.440 --> 56:09.760]  unemployment ignored by Univision Tullamundo and it just continues ladies
[56:09.760 --> 56:14.040]  and gentlemen homeowners are sitting on a record amount of cash and not tapping
[56:14.040 --> 56:19.440]  in show and it just continues ladies and gentlemen the only areas being hurt are
[56:19.440 --> 56:26.840]  retailers and things because obviously we have a situation with Amazon and the
[56:26.840 --> 56:29.840]  rest of it we're gonna go to break here in just a moment with Roger Stone and
[56:29.840 --> 56:33.800]  come back and talk about that but we can't be too confident because they're
[56:33.800 --> 56:38.280]  planning a lot of nastiness we'll talk about how they're planning to keep the
[56:38.280 --> 56:44.640]  president from getting this nominee through the approval process in the
[56:44.640 --> 56:51.560]  Senate we'll also look at this latest pardon and why he did it but also the
[56:51.560 --> 56:56.320]  larger strategy of why Trump is engaging in all of these part is early in his
[56:56.320 --> 56:59.320]  presidency which really is unprecedented I think a great idea but
[56:59.320 --> 57:04.440]  we'll explore all that don't forget today is the last day for the extended

[59:47.600 --> 59:51.880]  the renaissance and we are winning
[59:52.400 --> 59:57.800]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:09.040]  you thought the lead in winter would bring you down forever but you rode
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:15.800]  upon a steamer to the violence of the sun from the front lines of the
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:21.080]  information war. It's Alex Jones
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:30.320]  UK Prime Minister Theresa May is hanging by a thread after Brexit Secretary David
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:34.320]  Davies and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson resigned so why did they resign?
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:39.080]  Because Theresa May brazenly betrayed Brexit by proposing a deal with the EU
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:44.080]  that would de facto keep the UK in the customs union subjecting us to the same
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:49.240]  regulatory and legal framework that we voted to leave and hampering us from
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:52.600]  doing trade deals with other countries that would provide us with economic
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:57.960]  independence and prosperity the very reason why we voted for Brexit in the
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:01.760]  first place correct me if I'm wrong but when I went to vote in the referendum I
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:06.160]  didn't see a third option that said leave sign up to everything under a
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:11.160]  different name and be the EU's bitch to illustrate how this critical report is
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:15.560]  coming up I just wanted to show you the start of it to again encourage everybody
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:20.080]  to go to info wars calm to go to news wars calm and get the video and get it
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:25.040]  out there because the fact that they're trying to ignore the vote of the people
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:29.600]  of the UK to get out of the EU something that they never voted to do it to
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:33.000]  begin with is illustrative of how authoritarian it is just like I'm trying
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.400]  to overthrow our elected president that's the theme here because that's what
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:42.120]  they're doing going back to Roger Stone Roger any other points on Kavanaugh
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:46.040]  where you see this going and then let's shift gears into as I was just
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:54.400]  mentioning the latest pardon yeah I just a final point on a Kavanaugh it's
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:02:00.640]  instructed that Kavanaugh was a clerk for Justice Kennedy so it's conceivable
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:05.080]  that one of the reasons they were able to get Kennedy to step down was because
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:10.200]  he would be replaced by one of his clerks I would point out that justice
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:17.320]  Neil Gorsuch was also a clerk to judge Kennedy now as a Supreme Court justice
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:22.240]  even though he is retired Kennedy gets an office in the Supreme Court he gets to
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:27.640]  hang around and he would have two of his former clerks on the court perhaps it
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:33.400]  was sold to him that way the big news today Alex as you point out I was headed
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:39.360]  to Las Vegas this weekend where I was scheduled to speak to a rally on Sunday
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:46.000]  to free the Hammons the Hammons are embattled Oregon ranchers who ran a
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  file of the office of land management and were imprisoned for impossibly long
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:58.360]  sentences they have now been pardoned by the president in a blockbuster move so
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:04.520]  the rally that I was scheduled to speak to has been canceled happily this
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:08.000]  demonstrates that the president understands how to use the pardon not
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.680]  only to deliver justice for people who deserve deserve it Dwight Hammond is
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:19.560]  79 years old Stephen Hammond is 49 the evidence against them at trial was
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:26.280]  exceedingly weak the judge the Justice Department demanded a maximum five year
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:31.960]  sentence for them was even clear that they were guilty of setting a fire that
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:37.080]  they were accused of setting so the president also understands the symbolic
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:45.480]  nature of these pardons for the West for the the the rugged individual West this
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:50.200]  is a very clear sign that the president will stand up to the federal machinery
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:54.960]  that's been grinding these ranchers and farmers you know under their boot for
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:04:03.280]  many years I have been out West and you talk about jackboot dogs the way BLM
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:07.480]  behaves to just the general public the way they glare at people at the trade
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:12.440]  stations the way they act is very imperious very arrogant like like an
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:15.480]  occupying army and they're for folks that don't know let's come back to do a
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:19.920]  few more minutes on this is so critical some states like looking at Nevada are
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:25.320]  90% federal there are several others that are 75 80% but most those Western
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:29.280]  states are more than half federal and now they're always squeezing everybody
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:33.200]  off the land working with the UN working with the Nature Conservancy working
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:36.360]  with these groups and then they take people's farms and stuff and years
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:41.240]  later rich guys come and build a mansion on it it is it is very Byzantine
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:47.200]  it's very I would almost call it dark age what's going on and there is a war
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:51.760]  by the corrupt federal government against the West and Trump has signaled an
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:57.680]  end to that we'll be right back with Roger Stone straight ahead

[01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:32.960]  Austin Texas transmitting worldwide it's Alex Jones Roger Stone was just
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:41.040]  getting into the optics the iconography of President Trump this morning
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:49.760]  announcing that he is pardoning two members the Hammond family who had done
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:52.800]  some controlled burns before that are totally normal in your own land it was
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:56.240]  another controlled burns goes on all over the country and they couldn't
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:01.720]  prove it was them they tried to call it arson had a kangaroo group put him in
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:07.120]  jail sparked a lot of outrage I mean you've got illegal aliens killing people
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:11.200]  every day stabbing them and shooting them when they don't even go to jail or
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:16.560]  you know killing an FBI agent did a $280 fine meanwhile oh a fire that hurts
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:22.800]  nobody that burned some grass you're gonna go to jail for five years and then
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:26.760]  it's almost sparked a huge uprising in the West recap what you were saying
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:31.400]  about how they've been squeezing the West how under Obama and even Bush and
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:35.560]  Clinton they've taken so much more land how they treat people on their own land
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:39.280]  how they try to block roads so you can get to your land I mean there's a
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:43.320]  rewilding going on under UNESCO on the treaty that George Herbert Walker Bush
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:48.440]  signed well in the most egregious example of this of course was the Bundy
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:54.880]  family of Nevada the claim that the Bundy's hadn't paid their their rent
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:59.280]  in essence to the Fed to the government is false they attempted to pay their rent
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:03.640]  to the county because they believed the land believed belong to the state not
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:09.120]  the federal government the government's misconduct in the Bundy case was so
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:14.560]  egregious was so outrageous that the judge threw the case out and then it was
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:20.160]  announced last week that they will not be retried I flew out there for a rally
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:26.400]  for a freedom for the Bundy's several months ago and the energy was quite
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:34.040]  extraordinary so the Hammons are in a very similar situation sympathetic to
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:39.880]  the Bundy's but the ranchers and the farmers of the West are tired of these
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:44.960]  jackbooted thugs who work for them or the Bureau of Land Management where does
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:49.520]  it say that they get their own police department their own para military
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:55.800]  organization the the facts here were clear to the president he didn't have
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:09:00.560]  to pardon the Bundy's all I think he would have in the end the judge
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:06.040]  threw out those charges so a pardon became that unnecessary in this case he
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:10.560]  has done the valiant and right thing by pardoning the Hammons and it just shows
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:16.080]  what heroes the Bundy's and others have been and and David Knight was there in
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:19.240]  the middle of it with our crew just just an amazing historic event and the
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:23.960]  persecution they went through and the vindication by the judge there's
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:28.040]  there's something new in the wind out there people are sick of producers being
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:31.880]  harassed and targeted and treated like criminals and then criminals being held
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:37.320]  up like their gods Roger Stone we were talking just we only have a minute left
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:41.480]  for others Paul Watson report about the fact that the White House doesn't deny
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:45.800]  report Trump made secret deal with Kennedy over retirement replacement well
[01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:50.040]  that's think progress they just didn't respond to it but you know the whole point
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:54.680]  is if if Kennedy's leaving and they end up putting his old law clerk in there
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:10:00.440]  now that would that would make sense not illegal of how Trump makes deals to get
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:07.720]  things done think progress is the single least reliable fake news site anywhere
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:13.880]  on the internet anything they write is false they cannot be taken seriously in
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:20.080]  any way my point earlier was one of simple speculation I don't know that
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:24.800]  that happened but if it did it would not be illegal if the president told
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:29.840]  Justice Kennedy that he would consider his former clerk Brett Kavanaugh who
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:35.000]  everyone agrees is qualified that would not be in the slightest bit inappropriate
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:40.480]  but Chuck Schumer is now openly saying Kavanaugh was point appointed to thwart
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:45.760]  the Mueller investigation so there we have it you see the Democratic line of
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:49.520]  the day well that's what I came out with this morning that's one of the
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:54.560]  headlines is is that the Democrats have announced their plan to block all
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:58.640]  judicial nominations basically the president if there's any chance that any
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:02.400]  of the cases against him could ever be heard by any judge he puts in that's
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:06.800]  just an sane idea it's the executive branch that's what it does it nominates
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:11.880]  for the judiciary and then you have the legislative that then confirms so so
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:21.000]  they're trying to break the the judicial legislative executive division of power
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.680]  they are trying to basically block Trump's entire agenda with this new
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:30.440]  theory everybody should point out well it's pretty cockamamie because the last
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:36.840]  Supreme Court justice that Trump nominated got approved very very quickly
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:40.200]  because he's highly respected by both sides and they didn't even raise that
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:44.840]  point then so it just shows that they are grasping at straws but this is what
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:48.240]  they're gonna use when Michael Moore surrounds the Capitol and when they get
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:52.440]  their rioters out on the streets I think within just weeks are Roger let's talk
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:56.520]  about that timeline weeks or months before the midterms certainly we're
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:12:01.040]  gonna see them make their move for destabilization claiming oh he's about
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:05.160]  to put a judge in on his own criminal case stop him stop him and use
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:11.720]  legislative judicial executive ignorance in the Democratic constituencies
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:18.720]  foolish little brains to create this this perception and really have them try
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:22.720]  to move against the president but clearly that's the drum that Booker and
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:27.120]  Schumer and all these people are pushing Alex you're absolutely right
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:31.760]  look at also thinking it exposes their game plan for anybody who thinks that
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:36.800]  Mueller is not coming after Trump in a bid to remove him is wrong and they
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:41.560]  think this is going to end up in the Congress and in the courts and therefore
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:46.200]  they're trying to get there first the president has a legitimate right to make
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:50.000]  this appointment and the Senate will confirm him but it they've exposed their
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.880]  longtime game plan despite the fact that mr. Mueller's probe continues to be
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:13:00.960]  exposed as the partisan hit squad that it is has not lessened in any way his
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:07.280]  intention to try to take out the duly elected president Donald Trump Roger
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:12.120]  thank you so much for joining us we'll talk to you again very soon tonight on
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:16.800]  the war room we expose the two British globalists who working with George
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:22.880]  Soros have gotten a stranglehold on Americans America's digital electronic
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:27.040]  voting machines today at the war room this is critical so much of the
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:30.560]  information that ends up defeating the globalist originates on info wars that's
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:34.000]  why the audience yes you are the vanguard you're not just listening to be
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.560]  informed and again and also help us be informed and sending us tips and intel
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:44.360]  you are the folks that are reaching out to others show that we can report on the
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:49.280]  hardcore analysis then others pick it up later we end up being proven right and
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:53.200]  it ends up changing the world so three o'clock central today the war room
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:59.200]  Roger thank you great to be here speaking of Cory Booker let's play a clip of
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:01.920]  that and then I'll come back with a Watson piece but it is important this is
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:05.800]  just as important this is Cory Booker the senator and then we're gonna play a
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:10.680]  Schumer as well it's just disgusting here it is I'm a little sort of stunned
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:14.960]  at the way this is all played out if you look at the entire list of 20 or so
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:18.800]  people that he had on the one person the president could find on that list that
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:24.520]  would be most assured to rule in his favor should many of the things you're
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:28.680]  describing come before the Supreme Court is this judge he picked the one guy who
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:32.720]  was specifically written that a president in fact should not be the
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:37.800]  subject of a criminal investigation which the president is right now so this
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:41.400]  seems to be them of all the people the most self-serving person he could choose
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:50.400]  in order to protect himself from this criminal investigation Booker thinks his
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:57.600]  constituents are idiots which they are do you know how many judges and how many
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:06.880]  Supreme Court justices have said that you can't have a criminal investigation of
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:14.440]  the president originate out of the executive that's why you could never
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:20.720]  get Bill Clinton you could only have Congress then move with impeachment then
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:23.760]  once they're stripped then you can do that that's why nobody ever tried to
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:27.720]  charge Richard Nixon he stepped down then they didn't go ahead with the
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:37.600]  criminal charges but you cannot indict a sitting president and then have the case
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:43.920]  go forward because then every two-bit county or city or anything could sit
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:47.240]  there and bring down a president all day long just like Travis County the
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:53.520]  Democrats are constantly indicting Rick Perry and Tom delaying everybody it's
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:58.920]  unbelievable he thinks you're so stupid most of you know that heart disease is

[01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:41.960]  imagine being the globalist establishment and they think they can set
[01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:48.200]  up a private above-the-law tax exempt corporate world government owned by a
[01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:55.760]  bunch of rich white guys rich Arabs and rich Chinese people basically Chinese
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:21:00.000]  communists and then they can sit there and everybody else race war with each
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.960]  other and have the media all turn us against each other and then try to get
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:11.400]  us to reject capitalism and accept socialism and communism that then they
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:19.560]  administer multi-nationally we all live in a system of control where they tell
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:25.360]  us where to go where to live what to eat Bloomberg says I want to tell people
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:30.160]  what to eat I'm smarter than you I'm a technocrat in his own words Bloomberg
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:34.760]  has articles about him about how he's this great technocrat and he's gonna
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:44.040]  tell you how to live they are so blind by their arrogance and then you look at
[01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:49.840]  Brexit that was the first big domino to fall now with over 50 countries going
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:59.080]  towards capitalism becoming populist countries it's so exciting and you've
[01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:07.120]  got the EU about to collapse you've got Brexit two years later May tried to sell
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:11.080]  it out and keep them in the EU and that only makes people more angry and more
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:16.720]  awake remember we pass Brexit folks go oh well they'll just ignore it and I said
[01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:21.480]  that's even better because once people know they're getting screwed over they
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:30.600]  get angry they get informed no one even knew that the EU I was covered the EU
[01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:35.760]  20 years ago and people were saying oh the EU is not gonna take over the EU is
[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:40.440]  just a trade deal it's not gonna do anything there's no EU army there's no
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:44.720]  and now it's all here so everything we talked about is mainstream now they
[01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:47.440]  tried to demonize it they tried to make fun of it they tried to say it didn't
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:57.200]  exist forever but now we can have a real debate we won they're bullying their
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:01.920]  intimidation their attempt to say it's anti-semitic to say that the EU's corrupt
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:06.200]  doesn't work or if you want free market you're racist people aren't stupid they
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:10.440]  see through that except for the dumbest of the dumb who are being organized into
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:15.040]  zombie armies it's gonna Paul Joseph Watson's powerful report on what Theresa
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:19.520]  May has been caught doing just days before Trump travels to the UK UK
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:23.760]  Prime Minister Theresa May is hanging by a thread after Brexit Secretary David
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:27.720]  Davies and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson resigned so why did they resign
[01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:32.520]  because Theresa May brazenly betrayed Brexit by proposing a deal with the EU
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:37.480]  that would de facto keep the UK in the customs union subjecting us to the same
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:42.680]  regulatory and legal framework that we voted to leave and hampering us from
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:46.000]  doing trade deals with other countries that would provide us with economic
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:51.360]  independence and prosperity the very reason why we voted for Brexit in the
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:55.160]  first place correct me if I'm wrong but when I went to vote in the referendum I
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:59.600]  didn't see a third option that said leave sign up to everything under a
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:04.800]  different name and be the EU's bitch to illustrate how much of a sellout this
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:10.320]  was may ran the plan by Eurofiling Chief Angela Merkel before it was even
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:15.240]  seen by her own party's MPs knowing it was a bad deal she preempted her own
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:19.560]  ministers resigning on Friday by telling them they'd be quickly forgotten and
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:23.640]  revoking access to their government vehicles and guess who praised the
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:28.320]  plan Anna Subri Ken Clark and Vince Cable three of the biggest rim owners in
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:34.880]  Parliament that tells you everything as we warned all along Brexit is being
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:39.760]  betrayed Theresa May and her negotiators have cowed and rolled over to the EU
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:44.720]  at every turn a prime negotiator is a remainder who in his Oxford days was a
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:50.200]  Soviet fanboy who defended Stalin and implied communism was preferable to
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:55.120]  capitalism at this point they're taking the piss so what happens next well
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:59.640]  Boris and Davis have indicated that they resigned not to force Theresa May out
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:04.240]  but to force her to revise her disastrous Brexit plan which given that
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:08.600]  she's had two years to craft it and has delivered what Boris himself called a
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:15.240]  giant turd sounds like a fall on hope it's time for Theresa to go it's time
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:21.840]  to flush the turd 15% of conservative MPs or 48 of them to be precise have to
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:26.360]  write a letter to the 1922 committee triggering a vote of confidence in
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:30.880]  Theresa May if she loses then she's toast that will trigger a new leadership
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:35.600]  contest which hopefully a committed Brexiteer will win the new leader will
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:40.040]  then almost certainly feel a need to secure a mandate from the country by
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:44.120]  calling a new general election he or she will then have to defeat Labour's Jeremy
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:49.200]  Corbyn and save the UK from entering a hard left tyranny ruled by someone who
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:54.440]  thinks Venezuela socialist dystopia is a good example to follow if Corbyn wins
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:58.960]  he'll almost certainly derail Brexit or call for a second referendum if May
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:05.000]  wins she'll deliver at best a soft Brexit which is a Brexit in name only
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:09.960]  which is no Brexit at all so it's basically all or nothing we need a
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:15.280]  leader who believes in Brexit for most people that man is Jacob Reese Mock but
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:19.600]  JRM is a reluctant leader he's said numerous times he doesn't want to do
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:24.320]  it could Reese Mock be kingmaker could it be time for Boris since the day after
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:29.160]  Brexit I warned that the vote to leave was merely the start of the battle don't
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:33.400]  expect the elite to take this lying down they'll just make us vote again in
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:37.040]  another referendum until they get the result they want these people are
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:42.640]  snakes don't think the battle is won it's only just beginning Theresa May is
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:47.200]  surrounded by establishment globalists who share the very same attitude that
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:52.240]  sold us out to the EU in the first place the very backstab that Margaret
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:57.280]  Thatcher warned us about there's been no European Central Bank accountable to
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:01.200]  no one least of all to national parliament
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:06.640]  that kind of European Central Bank is no democracy taking powers away from every
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:11.680]  single Parliament and being able to have a single currency and a monetary
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:16.880]  policy and an interest rate which takes all political power away from us as my
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:20.840]  right Honourable Friends said in his first speech after the proposal of a
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:25.840]  single currency a single currency is about the politics of Europe it is about
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:30.200]  a federal Europe by the back door they have no interest whatsoever in
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:34.960]  delivering Brexit they have no loyalty to this sovereign nation so
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:40.760]  Conservative MPs have a choice to make is your loyalty to Theresa May's dreadful
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:46.400]  political legacy a legacy that has betrayed 17.4 million people and the
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:51.480]  very notion of democracy itself a legacy that has led directly to the UK
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:56.360]  soaring violent crime problem a legacy that has exacerbated the problem of
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:00.760]  mass uncontrolled immigration a legacy that has eroded free speech and
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:06.880]  emboldened cultures hostile to our own is your loyalty to that worth more than
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:12.120]  your loyalty to your country is it worth more than your loyalty to the sanctity
[01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:17.120]  of democracy is your legacy going to be about how you sold out to Brussels or
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:22.960]  how at this pivotal moment in UK political history you stood up for Great

[01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:27.080]  to you live from the front lines of the info war well Mark Rondizid writes a
[01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:30.280]  piece for CNN you see him all over the news he's recognized as in the top three
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:34.960]  first amendment lawyers out there and he represents me in the whole Sandy Hook
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:39.040]  a defamation matter that we're not gonna really get into today but we're gonna
[01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:42.680]  have 20 questions with him because he can cover the waterfront he calls himself
[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:45.800]  kind of a classical liberal on a mainline establishment liberal not a
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:49.200]  right-winger but a classical liberal I kind of call myself that as well but
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:52.800]  all the terms are turned around but I was asking him about Brett Kavanaugh his
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:57.880]  view on him he's on a deep dive on him on some big issues you know his take on
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:01.760]  Trump just pragmatically what Trump's doing and then the state of the craze
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:05.280]  left and how he thinks we can counter but but it's a great to have you here
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:09.040]  with us thanks Alex great to be here where do you want to start just on the
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:12.760]  deep dive you did on the cabinet you know I first got some calls from the
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:17.960]  press on what I thought of Kavanaugh when before he was the nominee just when
[01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:22.120]  his name was being floated and my initial reaction was pretty bad because he
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:27.200]  made a decision in a boss versus foreign policy group LLC out of the DC circuit
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:32.200]  where he took the DC anti-slap law and said it didn't apply in federal court
[01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:36.280]  that anti-slap laws had no place in federal court now as somebody who
[01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:41.320]  employs anti-slap laws a lot for my defendants I mean I was instrumental in
[01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:45.920]  getting the Nevada one passed that really struck me with a with a negative
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:51.280]  cord so my reaction was this guy's going to be bad for free speech then when he
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:55.640]  became the nominee I stayed up all night doing a dive into his first amendment
[01:34:55.640 --> 01:35:00.640]  decisions and you know I've really kind of come around a bit I think he's I
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:06.080]  think he's not going to be bad because in in that same a boss decision he made
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:11.840]  a really good statement about reporters asking questions in a case cannot be
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:16.560]  held liable for defamation because they're simply asking questions now you
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:20.640]  can ask a question in a way that is quite obviously you're really just saying
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:25.520]  something defamatory you know when did so-and-so stop having sex with goats you
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:29.480]  know that's that's not of doesn't Brian's shelter look like somebody you
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:33.440]  wouldn't have babysit your children I mean you could add yeah that's that you
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:36.320]  could probably get away with but you know saying something something that's
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:39.480]  clearly defamatory and throwing a question mark on the end of it is another
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:43.720]  story but if you're doing anything that's reasonably close to journalism
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:48.200]  you're going to be okay there's another decision that he made that I really
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:53.720]  really liked where he called call versus Bureau of National Affairs where he
[01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:56.960]  talked about how the First Amendment guarantees freedom of the press and
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:02.080]  freedom of speech and how costly and time-consuming litigation can threaten
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:06.200]  those freedoms so like when you have it which is exactly what the Democrats
[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:10.280]  admit they're doing in lawfare against Trump supporters right so when you do
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:14.360]  that when you file a lawsuit look you you get a lawsuit filed against you you
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:18.560]  come into my office I mean I immediately tell you you better kiss a lot of money
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:23.360]  goodbye because defense is not cheap you know if you you want a more modestly
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:27.240]  priced attorney we can send you to one but even then that's still expensive and
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:32.160]  that is losing even more expensive losing is even more expensive but you
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:36.440]  know when I when I was a very very young lawyer I got handed a defamation case
[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:41.480]  that I was defending all on my own against a very large law firm and I was
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:46.160]  pretty proud of myself when I won and when I handed this this client the the
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:50.960]  decision saying hey we won and he looks at me and says well if we won why is my
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:55.040]  retirement fund empty and that really struck me and that's why I've been a
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:59.960]  proponent of the anti of the slap provisions yeah because I despise
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:05.520]  seeing someone go out there and exercise their First Amendment rights and then
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:10.120]  somebody decides that they want to take a swipe at them just to punish them for
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:15.960]  using those rights legitimately aren't you glad you chose the the Georgetown is
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:20.480]  also saying me aren't you glad you chose the First Amendment because that was big
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:24.720]  then but it's really big now Alex I didn't choose it it chose me you know
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:30.080]  every every First Amendment lawyer that I know this is something that it chooses
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:34.000]  them you know you when you're a kid every one of us has this story like that
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.680]  we call it our quit hassling me man moment when we learn about our
[01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:41.600]  constitutional rights and then I'd say within 24 hours of learning about them
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:45.720]  you find that somebody's violating them and then you stand up for them and you
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:50.520]  get slapped down again and you got to recognize that if you really want to
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:53.520]  protect the First Amendment you really want to protect your constitutional
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:57.560]  rights it's a constant fight it it's stressful it's it's pretty easy just to
[01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:02.040]  let it go but there's some of us who won't do that you know I so I don't do
[01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:05.040]  it because I chose it saying hey this is gonna be a great way to make you got
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:08.120]  pushed around and so you stood up and you've had some some great success doing
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:12.560]  it yeah so so long out back to the new nominee
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:16.760]  Kavanaugh yeah you've got a lot of his decisions here I do I've got about six
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:20.760]  pages of quotes from him and you know whether it comes for whether it's
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:26.600]  commercial speech whether it's journalism I'm in general you know I'm
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:31.400]  gonna give this guy a b-plus coming in and you know a couple days ago and you
[01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:37.120]  know I admit I was probably a little bit overly overly negative about him
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:40.680]  simply because of that one Abbas decision because you did the back of the
[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:43.800]  envelope quick analysis and now you've had a chance to look into it yeah I mean
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:48.280]  I'd go crazy if I had done this kind of a all-night dive on everybody who was on
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:51.800]  the shortlist because they'll cause knowing Trump they could have had five
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:54.440]  or six people on that list and then all of a sudden he pulls somebody out of
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:39:00.920]  left field but yeah when in really looking at this guy I am I'm optimistic
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:06.360]  that his view on the First Amendment is gonna be good for the country well
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:09.200]  that's a good thing because historically it's been the right wingers that have
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:13.240]  been on the wrong side of it and so how does that juxtapose that the left I
[01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:17.480]  would describe the left uniformly against the First Amendment uniformly
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:21.120]  admitting in lawsuits against me which is flabbergasted you and many lawyers
[01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:24.920]  we're not gonna get the cases themselves that they say we want to end the First
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:28.880]  Amendment we want to overthrow it we want to shut it down for everybody but
[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:31.000]  us they're like they're they're launching what they've done at the
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:37.360]  universities as a war outside with actual universities arguing for me to be
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:41.880]  silent yeah look currently the the wind is blowing from the you know that the
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:46.800]  cold wind is blowing from the left today those of us who actually believe in
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:50.640]  the First Amendment that have stand stand on the same ground that we did
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:55.080]  ten years ago and now we're all being called right wing you know back then I
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:58.480]  was being called a libtard you know I don't really care one way or the other
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:04.840]  I believe in this this is what I stand to fight yes right now I find the left
[01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:09.960]  looking for exceptions trying to say you know I really didn't like Kagan's
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:14.800]  language a few weeks ago about how the the conservative wing was weaponizing
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:18.440]  the First Amendment you know that that frankly shouldn't be a pejorative the
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:22.280]  First Amendment is a weapon it all and the left has gone way past with
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:25.560]  everybody's a Nazi and they go past the First Amendment though they're calling
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:29.320]  for violence they're calling for uprisings I mean they really passed
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:33.400]  the Rubicon look I don't know that they have gone you know I'm a little less
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:37.200]  pessimistic about it but yeah you know I remember when the you know the first
[01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:42.480]  person said it was it's okay to punch a Nazi and then you know you like to
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:45.880]  like hot coffee on you because you were talking I saw it in a bunch of news
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:48.520]  articles when it came out you were representing me because a lot of other
[01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:51.280]  lawyers we already had you to consult it we're gonna be having you involved but
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:56.400]  all these other lawyers were scared to sign on the dotted line and plus was
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:00.040]  great I'd met you by then you're obviously the best guy for it but the
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:04.080]  fact they're now calling you a Nazi and you're getting threats that's fine
[01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:07.200]  with me you know that's but but the lie because you you represent porn
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:10.960]  companies you represent Nazis you represent vermin supreme you represent
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:16.800]  left right center so the idea that you are your client is just intellectually a
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:20.720]  complete fraud I mean they know that a defense lawyer that a First Amendment
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:24.960]  lawyer that it's their job to go out and represent somebody and then to call
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:31.400]  you a Nazi because you represented Nazis is just fraud look I I frankly
[01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:36.840]  welcome it because you know you you judge a man by his enemies and the more
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:40.200]  they're coming at you the more it means you're doing something right look I
[01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:45.000]  read that New York Times hit piece and I just laughed you know and then of all
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:48.200]  things the Huffington Post wrote a follow-up piece where they actually did
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:53.680]  acknowledge yeah I represent I'm proud to represent vermin supreme the I mean I
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:58.000]  represent a group of a political action committee of Muslim feminists you know
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.320]  and then at the same time yeah I represent the Daily Stormer because I
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:05.360]  think if you are a First Amendment lawyer and you pick and choose your
[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:08.880]  clients based on what they have to say you're not a First Amendment let's be
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:13.680]  clear you're a hack those Nazi sides they they attack me constantly they say
[01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:18.000]  things about my family that aren't true particularly a storm front or whatever
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.360]  and you know what they have a right though I believe in the First Amendment
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:26.400]  I'm a big boy but the left has said we get the Nazis first then we get everybody
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:31.000]  else well that's the problem because it is you know when you had the whole
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:36.240]  punch a Nazi meme and then it's well you can punch a Nazi and then anyone who
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:39.640]  doesn't disagree with me is you know doesn't agree with me as a Nazi now you
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:42.840]  just punch anybody who doesn't agree with me yeah you're a Nazi boom bottle
[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:46.160]  over the head right I mean you know kids wearing a make America great again hat
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:50.800]  well since when does that you know wearing a symbol of a sitting president
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:54.320]  whether you like him or not you know if you're wearing a if somebody is wearing
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:58.000]  a since when does it get you whacked over the head we'll be back this 4th
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:02.240]  of July is special everybody can see it they could feel it the globalists are
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:07.240]  attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny and America yet again
[01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:11.280]  is at the heart of the resistance the globalist that's why this 4th of July
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:15.160]  I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about in full wars now more than
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:18.720]  ever and what would the world be like if info wars wasn't there resisting the
[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:22.520]  globalist what would have happened if you hadn't supported info wars we would
[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:25.720]  not be having the victories we have today so yes a lot of good things are
[01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:29.600]  happening but the enemy is striking back so please think about info wars and

[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:03.200]  sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:07.720]  Lailania states but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we
[01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:12.760]  need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:17.520]  metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:23.520]  levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:28.160]  pH what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals
[01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:32.960]  and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our Alexa pure
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:37.920]  gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:43.680]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the
[01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:48.680]  Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash
[01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:53.600]  and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more importantly a
[01:44:53.600 --> 01:45:00.400]  good water filtration system will purify it feeling your body is hard work
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:05.360]  that's why we've introduced the info wars life daily digestive pack to help

[01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:19.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:27.360]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones by the way I
[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:31.280]  had one of the editors walk in here earlier an article that's on news wars.com
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:35.720]  and I'm not criticizing him for this because we try to you know check things
[01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:39.760]  and go over things but normally it's something I'm gonna get sued for. This is
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:44.120]  Judge Andrew DePolitano friend of mine respect him Roger Stone's basically his
[01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:49.120]  best friend he's a really smart guy he's been on the list to do it as well I
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:55.160]  don't think he's shower grapes he was very happy with Judge Gorsuch but he
[01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:59.040]  says the heart and soul of the establishment is what this new judge is
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:03.960]  Brett Kavanaugh and so the crew is like well we're pro-trumped are we gonna put
[01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:09.240]  this out I'm like absolutely people ask about info wars they go in fact even
[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:12.800]  mainstream media goes you'll see a clip of a New York Times article or a news
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:17.080]  week and you'll see one person saying this and another saying that we're just
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:21.240]  trying to have a free discussion here and I like Clifford Cunningham I respect
[01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:25.280]  our writer and I think this is a really good article you know that a lot of
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:29.080]  people are concerned about this that he's two establishment Republican and
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:32.660]  Judge DePolitano is really respected you know and he's got an issue and Rand
[01:48:32.660 --> 01:48:38.480]  Paul's got an issue all I'm saying is Trump is so pragmatic about everything
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:43.080]  he's doing for the average little guy and the results of it because I study
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:46.320]  all these areas I was just talking about you know meat packing during the break
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:49.200]  something my family within the cattle business has been involved in and out of
[01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:51.840]  some big cattle families that are just getting out of the business because
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:56.040]  there's three packing companies it's all rigged and then the cattle producers
[01:48:56.040 --> 01:49:00.000]  cannot even make a living they've set it up like that well Trump behind the
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:05.280]  scenes is looking I've been told to try to bust that up so you separating this
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:08.720]  from Kavanaugh you were saying doing the deep dive on him and then looking at
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:11.920]  what Trump's done in his policies I wouldn't even call him conservative I'd
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:15.840]  call him Americana and I know you as a classical liberal will take heat for
[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:19.080]  this but you said no I want to say on air right now I like Trump so in your
[01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:22.240]  own words I mean that's quite a coming out there yeah I mean I didn't vote for
[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:26.520]  him yeah you know and I don't have not as I voted for Gary Johnson but you know
[01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:32.000]  I'm at this point I'm not gonna say I'm not voting for him in 2020 he has I
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:36.840]  think this trade war that he's started I think the I want to see the outcome of
[01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:39.840]  it I'm not smart enough and when it comes to economics I mean you asked me a
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:43.840]  question about the First Amendment that I know economics I don't so I could be
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:48.400]  crazy on this but I think the outcome of this is gonna be good for us I see him
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:53.680]  looking at certain economic policies you know from almost a Teddy Roosevelt
[01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:59.040]  standpoint more than more than an establishment standpoint so you know my
[01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:03.400]  401k has never done so well so I'm also looking at that and like you said so
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:07.960]  bad he wants to drive down drug prices not with a socialist answer but by
[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:11.360]  making them have competition and going wait you want to pay for somebody's
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:14.600]  assisted suicide and I think if somebody wants to you know die that's fine
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:17.600]  it's one of the government involved don't make me pay for it by the way but
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:21.840]  you don't want thousands of drugs and treatments blocked sometimes for 20 years
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:25.880]  given to someone who's terminal who chooses to try to save their life you
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:30.440]  want me to pay for someone to kill themselves but I can't let them pay to
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:34.280]  try to save themselves now when yeah when he loosened up the regulations for
[01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:38.760]  experimental treatment yeah when I'm you know when you see somebody going to
[01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:43.840]  Mexico for treatment because they can't try something here because it hasn't been
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:48.040]  FDA approved and that's sad you know if you're desperate you're at the end of
[01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:51.880]  your rope anyway I don't see any reason why you shouldn't be able to give that
[01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:56.440]  a whirl how would you describe Trump I just think very pragmatic because he's
[01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:59.680]  like look I'm not I love America because I'm all for trade other companies he
[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:04.760]  goes China can't have 30 40 50% tariffs yeah and China can't have lower taxes
[01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:09.240]  us on us the corporate stuff that's a tariff you know one examples 280% tariffs
[01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:13.160]  on all our dairy to Canada he goes we have zero on you he goes I'm gonna start
[01:51:13.160 --> 01:51:16.880]  out with a hundred percent and they flip out how is it I can punch you in the
[01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:21.760]  face 280 times but then I'm only gonna punch back a hundred and then I'm the
[01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:25.920]  bad guy I mean and then I when I look at something like that that seems
[01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:30.160]  reasonable at the same time I still have to admit where I'm ignorant and you know
[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:34.440]  I took one economics class in 1988 and I got to be in it so here's the bottom line
[01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:38.720]  don't take my word for it I've read the CFR I don't have degrees and all this
[01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:42.160]  stuff I read the boiled down real white papers not their propaganda in the news
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:47.620]  they made the decision in the 50s they saw the leftist elites did and they said
[01:51:47.620 --> 01:51:52.080]  America's got half the world's power half the world's wealth it's not fair
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:55.400]  they were all really socialist and communist and academics and they said
[01:51:55.400 --> 01:51:58.200]  let's build up China and other countries and let's have deals with
[01:51:58.200 --> 01:52:01.440]  regulations to shut us down no regulations on them and let's transfer
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:04.920]  power to those countries now that was the useful idiot level the big banks and
[01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:09.120]  the big corporations they just wanted to dominate economically so China has been
[01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:13.080]  set up to take us down the CFR said the new centuries the Chinese century
[01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:19.080]  America's done and so then they rigged it mark where they would rise and we would
[01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:24.640]  fall in Trump saying uh-uh-uh so it's totally right it is but you know it's
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:28.600]  when I see when I see the way these regulations have worked to the benefit
[01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:32.800]  of large corporations and you know we see essentially I mean I'm not really
[01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:37.120]  sure the nation state is the best way to organize people but it sure beats an
[01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:41.440]  unaccountable corporation and that's where I see or the Central Committee of
[01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:47.800]  the Politburo the Chinese president is not a president he has been elected by
[01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:51.960]  the Communist Party of thousand people the Politburo selected who could vote
[01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:57.440]  and then they just made him dictator three months ago officially said well
[01:52:57.440 --> 01:53:01.320]  now we can never vote to remove you and your vice president's a dictator well in
[01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:03.880]  general you know when we look at the American system I have similar
[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:07.240]  criticisms because we only have you know we say isn't it terrible they have one
[01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:10.720]  party rule well we have a duopoly and we have a duopoly that's almost
[01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:15.880]  unbreakable but you're for term limits well I'm not just term limits I'm for
[01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:19.640]  breaking up the duopoly I mean I think we should do anything we can to break the
[01:53:19.640 --> 01:53:22.520]  backs of the Democratic and the Republican you know I used to feel like
[01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:27.240]  that why should why should they trade off trade off power every four to eight
[01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:30.640]  years they trade off power one way or the other and the rest of us are not
[01:53:30.640 --> 01:53:35.000]  party hacks most of us you know most of us join one team or the other and as a
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:38.560]  lawyer you know how complex they make the party apparatus exactly then that's
[01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:41.920]  what keeps people from doing insurrections within the party sure I mean but
[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:44.800]  Trump just did it he just took the Republican Party over he did but you
[01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:47.640]  know why do you think I mean I would have loved to see Trump versus Bernie
[01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:50.920]  Sanders because then you have insurgents from both sides you know
[01:53:50.920 --> 01:53:55.120]  instead the Democrats put their hack up and as usually happens you know it was
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:59.080]  it should have been a have you heard and I confirmed it Hillary is planning to
[01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:04.280]  run in 2020 well if that happens you know I am not gonna be very popular back
[01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:07.960]  in Massachusetts but I'm voting for Trump then there's no way I could see
[01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:12.040]  that happening I don't but I have the same objection to her that I have to
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:16.360]  another Bush go into the White House oh it's just we don't need royalty in this
[01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:21.280]  country exactly and if it's you know if the Republicans don't put up anybody
[01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:26.040]  but a but a Bush I'll vote for a Trump if the Democrats want to put up a
[01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:29.760]  Clinton again but look at her arrogance the Democratic Party's bankrupt she's
[01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:33.960]  got a billion still in her campaign war chest a couple billion in her foundation
[01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:38.960]  she did that on purpose she is the Democratic Party she owns it and she's
[01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:46.200]  so arrogant that she thinks he's gonna stay it's crazy yeah I I mean look I
[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:50.480]  predicted she was gonna win so don't take my predictions and to the bank I
[01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:54.360]  predicted Trump was gonna win yeah I died didn't I died woke up on an airplane
[01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:57.720]  on the way to Warsaw and said I thought it was the ambient talking when I read
[01:54:57.720 --> 01:55:05.520]  the screen so I really I was shocked but let me tell you a little secret the
[01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:08.880]  military didn't get involved in hacking election it wasn't the Russians it was
[01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:12.760]  the military and intelligence agencies blocked Hillary trying to steal some
[01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:17.680]  key states and I mean we're not just Trump's not just doing this on his own
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:23.480]  I you know not my not my area you know my area is the first amendment so when it
[01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:26.520]  comes to saying they've got their whole shadow government but you know what
[01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:30.960]  happens when the shadow government and the deep state rebels because he Trump's
[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:33.720]  like deep state deep state that's only the top globalist Democrats are trying
[01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:38.000]  to block him the general deep state are just people in the whole I mean you know
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:41.840]  how countries work I mean China's got a hundred million people outside its country
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:45.520]  that are military aged men who are really intelligence operatives in their
[01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:48.920]  companies and corporations Congress is about to have hearings on well you don't
[01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:52.320]  think they're the only ones that do that right of course not I mean that's we've
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:55.480]  had that blueprint for years yes the British Empire did it the French have
[01:55:55.480 --> 01:55:59.280]  it we have it you know in China so the left that all you guys need to surrender
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:03.240]  because it's over I mean you're not gonna win well and if you kill Trump
[01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:06.840]  there's backup plans for that and here's the thing he did get elected he
[01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:11.760]  actually won in a giant tsunami but they stole so many votes and so much stuff
[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:16.040]  that he almost lost well even if you go with the with the narrative that's
[01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:19.880]  actually in the press I mean he did it fair and square you know that's how the
[01:56:19.880 --> 01:56:23.800]  electoral college works it's there for a reason because we do not want I don't
[01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:27.840]  want to live in a country that's simply New York Chicago and Los Angeles making
[01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:30.320]  all the decisions and that's why we have the separation of powers that's why
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:32.400]  we have the electoral college that's why we have all that and you're right
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:35.120]  but see you're smarter than you say you are you're just you're just putting
[01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:39.240]  provisos in there look what do you want to get into when we come back next hour
[01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:43.240]  because you're on fire we got a lot to cover you know I think we were talking
[01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:46.680]  about the political violence is probably a good thing to talk about we need to go
[01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:50.680]  to those videos anti-fud tacking the left running foxes reporters out of the
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:53.400]  Supreme Court I've been at the Supreme Court across the street don't even let
[01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:57.280]  you film it and then meanwhile they say without a permit meanwhile they just let
[01:56:57.280 --> 01:57:01.560]  the left go crazy so that's all coming up briefly so enough money to pay this

[01:59:48.960 --> 02:00:07.360]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:27.320]  all right next segment's longer so we'll get into the left's accelerating
[02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:30.400]  violence with the top first amendment lawyer in his horror of it mark on
[02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:34.600]  daza and again you're like okay great you know he's a liberal but a mainline
[02:00:34.600 --> 02:00:39.720]  liberal would would would attack him he's a classical liberal it takes a lot
[02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:42.720]  of courage I mean there's other top lawyers in this country who were you
[02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:47.000]  know and they are all scared to death their law firms won't even let him
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:50.280]  defend not just me but other conservatives and libertarians there's a
[02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:54.600]  real chilling effect going on out there and that's why if Kavanaugh was a bad
[02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:58.160]  guy on the first amendment that would be a big problem and I would oppose his
[02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:01.600]  nomination I just don't want to oppose his nomination and then get something
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:05.040]  worse so in the few months we've gotten this segment you've done the deep dive
[02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:08.720]  yeah more of his rulings and statements and you were critical earlier when you
[02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:11.840]  just kind of picked up some mainstream news but you've actually read the a bunch
[02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:16.200]  of the rulings last night now you're be plus well you know I the case that I
[02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:21.240]  knew him about was that a boss case where he he ruled that the anti-slap laws
[02:01:21.240 --> 02:01:25.760]  shouldn't be used in federal court I think that's a bad thing I don't think
[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:31.400]  his analysis was correct he was following a an opinion by Alex Kaczynski from the
[02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:35.520]  Ninth Circuit who's his former mentor and you know I can understand following
[02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:40.040]  your mentor I got mentors out there that that I will always respect them even
[02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:44.320]  if even if they're wrong I also didn't really like that he's a double Yale grad
[02:01:44.320 --> 02:01:48.720]  I mean I think if there's one he's a super white shoe boy yeah if there's one
[02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:53.200]  thing I think the Supreme Court really needs it needs diversity but I'm not
[02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:57.560]  talking about diversity of race or gender although I think maybe a state
[02:01:57.560 --> 02:02:00.640]  judge maybe a regular trial lawyer then how about somebody who didn't go to
[02:02:00.640 --> 02:02:04.800]  Harvard or Yale because there is nothing magical about those institutions you
[02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:08.600]  know except people talk about cabals who really secretly runs things yeah it's
[02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:12.080]  Harvard or Yale it's it's whether it's whether it's Zuckerberg it's like
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:16.000]  every damn one of them yeah I mean look but yeah one of the smartest lawyers I've
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:19.840]  I've ever met a guy by the name of Bob Cornrevere he went to Catholic University
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:24.280]  of America it's a third-tier school and the guy will you know I mean he sees he's
[02:02:24.280 --> 02:02:29.360]  an idol of mine so we're not talking about like something magical happens to
[02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:33.840]  you in Cambridge or New Haven that that makes you somehow smarter so that I
[02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:38.800]  didn't like I didn't like his decision in a boss but you know that's that's
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:43.480]  but back to this we can expand on this after we need to but it's become a
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:48.200]  mafia even people that have gone there and a PhDs from there like Dr. Boyle we
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:51.520]  have on he explains that it's not that they're that good they've gotten their
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:56.000]  people all in the government and now they're only incestuously a form of
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:59.880]  nepotism only bringing in their own yeah it's it's always you know it's always
[02:02:59.880 --> 02:03:03.280]  like a relief to me when I see that a judge wasn't necessarily from Harvard
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:06.960]  Yale or Stanford I mean there's there's no reason that we should be picking
[02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:11.000]  judges only from those places now there's other schools that are you know I
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:14.840]  don't know why the heck you wasted your money to go there that I wouldn't want
[02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:18.880]  to pick people from but that's that's a very limited list as well well you're
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:23.120]  from Georgetown it was always respected that Georgetown suing me I mean a very
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:27.600]  shameful behavior yeah look I you know I Georgetown was the first time that I
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:30.240]  started getting looked at as a conservative when I was like wait a
[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:34.400]  minute I'm a you know I'm a pretty left-wing guy from Massachusetts and
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:39.440]  and I'm and I'm not buying into some of their deep political correctness we have
[02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:43.680]  the guy coming on who started the walk away movement in 30 minutes and he's a
[02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:47.120]  liberal gay guy and people are throwing him out of businesses trying to attack
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:51.400]  him all because he says man the Democrats have become like a cult yeah
[02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:55.000]  it's you know what I mean I think it's it's sort of a natural reaction that
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:04:00.920]  everybody was so shocked when Trump got elected and you know the mantra on the
[02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:05.000]  on the you know on the Democrats side was this is gonna ruin the country it's
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:08.080]  gonna create the forthright it's gonna be the handmaid's tail if he gets
[02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:11.920]  elected well now what happens if that doesn't happen then they're wrong and
[02:04:11.920 --> 02:04:16.800]  you know what if they can't be wrong so they have to keep this narrative up that
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:21.320]  is the crisis narrative and you know and like this is not healthy for us you know I
[02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:26.160]  see people in in families not talking to each other over politics are you
[02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:30.000]  kidding me I have people contacting your politics I have people contacting
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:34.440]  basically threatening my family because they're my parents or my wife yeah it's
[02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:40.080]  look it's crazy I mean I've you know it really is there's no need for it and I
[02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:44.800]  think that anybody who starts to see that as a problem for any reason needs to
[02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:47.640]  reach across and like I hang out with people that don't agree with me at all
[02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:51.200]  I love hanging out yeah because if you don't do that you're in a cult we'll be
[02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:55.240]  back with all the leftist violence stay with us

[02:06:20.520 --> 02:06:24.880]  mark remdas it's personal family stuff you're not the state of you don't want
[02:06:24.880 --> 02:06:27.440]  to I was just talking about how they what they wage wars against our families
[02:06:27.440 --> 02:06:29.720]  yeah just because you're a first woman lawyer the stuff that's happened to you
[02:06:29.720 --> 02:06:33.160]  but I talked about taking my daughters to camp 10 12 days ago to drop them off
[02:06:33.160 --> 02:06:37.400]  and there was info or stickers on trunks and and and and and like you know
[02:06:37.400 --> 02:06:42.960]  10-year-old girls running up saying we love you and all like all of the camp
[02:06:42.960 --> 02:06:45.880]  counselor boys when I pulled up because they were getting all the trunks and
[02:06:45.880 --> 02:06:48.320]  putting them on a trailer to go to different camps like Alex Jones we love
[02:06:48.320 --> 02:06:52.120]  you taking pictures but I saw some horrified liberal mothers like like and
[02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:56.920]  they just don't get it like why are the young people ages like six seven eight
[02:06:56.920 --> 02:07:01.720]  nine up to about 18 which they admit Generation Z is rebelling against SJW
[02:07:01.720 --> 02:07:05.320]  garbage of course they do I mean that that's a natural thing for kids to do you
[02:07:05.320 --> 02:07:08.520]  know it's like look back in the back in the 80s you know I was a punk rock kid
[02:07:08.520 --> 02:07:13.480]  reacting against Reagan and I like punk rock I mean I like well conservatives the
[02:07:13.480 --> 02:07:17.040]  new punk rock man I mean that's really what it is right now you know you see
[02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:21.480]  these kids show I look at these kids who are showing up to college in in suits
[02:07:21.480 --> 02:07:25.360]  and and styling themselves as conservatives I don't care if they're
[02:07:25.360 --> 02:07:28.880]  misguided or not I look at it I'm glad they're finding a voice and I'm glad
[02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:32.040]  they're not taking what their parents and their professors tell them as gospel
[02:07:32.040 --> 02:07:36.440]  because that's how the marketplace of ideas grows that's that's how that's
[02:07:36.440 --> 02:07:39.800]  how thought grows even if they come around I mean I admitted right here on
[02:07:39.800 --> 02:07:44.520]  air my initial response to to the Cavanaugh was negative and now I'm
[02:07:44.520 --> 02:07:48.160]  saying I did a little more research and I realized I think I was wrong that's
[02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:51.720]  that's just it's a great thing when I see when I see kids arguing with their
[02:07:51.720 --> 02:07:55.600]  parents over politics whether it's when I was arguing with my parents saying not
[02:07:55.600 --> 02:07:59.840]  Reagan's terrible you know and and and you know and this is this is just a
[02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:05.520]  horrible nationalistic jingoistic regime and then I see kids doing the same thing
[02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:09.280]  to their SJW parents that's wonderful the kids are all right of course your dad
[02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:13.160]  you were saying is a huge make America great again go my dad is probably one
[02:08:13.160 --> 02:08:17.000]  of the biggest Trump supporters that that that exists yes and that's you know
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:21.280]  I'm I'm pretty middle of the road you know and he's doing it though like an
[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:25.400]  area like Austin in Massachusetts well Massachusetts is yeah about as blue as
[02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:29.880]  you can get so yeah he drives around with his I support Trump sticker on his
[02:08:29.880 --> 02:08:34.040]  car and he doesn't care what anybody thinks which you know where did I get
[02:08:34.040 --> 02:08:38.360]  just that's the chip I got from the old man but that's good I mean that's but
[02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:41.880]  that's especially when they're trying to bully you then it makes it even more
[02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:45.120]  valuable and does make me more aggressive people come up to me and yell and
[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:49.280]  call me names on like what planet are you from now let's get into that since
[02:08:49.280 --> 02:08:53.000]  you mentioned it yeah you mentioned just I mean over 4th of July there were
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:56.720]  hundreds of attacks the left calls it a new civil war they call it you know this
[02:08:56.720 --> 02:09:00.360]  uprising Michael Moore all of them are calling for it then I point out that they
[02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:03.320]  said they're launching it they make a joke out of it but let's roll some of
[02:09:03.320 --> 02:09:07.080]  that video of the water burger with a guy grabbing them make America great again
[02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:11.960]  hat throwing you know his eyes tea on him let's go ahead and roll that audio
[02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:17.640]  then let's go into what happened in Portland and then let's go into what
[02:09:17.640 --> 02:09:21.760]  happened this weekend in San Francisco a Christian prayer vigil and grown men
[02:09:21.760 --> 02:09:25.920]  Antifa beating up women's let's go ahead while you're talking and roll some of
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:31.000]  this video well you know initially when you know we saw the video earlier of
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:35.880]  Richard Spencer getting punched now I don't approve of that I don't think it's
[02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:40.480]  okay to punch a Nazi you know I think when you cross the speech violence
[02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:45.280]  divide you're automatically wrong but then it was you know it had this allure
[02:09:45.280 --> 02:09:49.800]  to it you could you could look at like well I'm just punching Nazis but then
[02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:53.360]  everybody who doesn't agree with you as a Nazi and now it's this kid with his
[02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:58.120]  make America great again hat you know getting attacked and it's and then it
[02:09:58.120 --> 02:10:03.080]  just becomes Nazis are people I want to punch now what is the end result of that
[02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:06.960]  it isn't like you can just you've just become a Nazi because the Nazis dehumanize
[02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:11.400]  groups of people and then one after them well I mean my position is nobody's a
[02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:17.280]  Nazi except the Nazis even I think even neo-nazis today in America are not what
[02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:20.840]  you know what 1930 yeah they're not a bunch of disgruntled World War one
[02:10:20.840 --> 02:10:24.920]  veterans that were half nerve-gassed and half alive all crazed following a
[02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:30.000]  psychopath I mean I mean I saw the best way I saw people to shut down Nazis was
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:34.800]  I saw a video a while back where this kid just followed a Nazi march with a
[02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:39.720]  tuba and played this silly you know boom boom boom the tuba sound to it and it
[02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:43.240]  made them look so ridiculous and I looked at it I thought it was a thing of
[02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:47.560]  beauty they're exercising their first amendment rights he's exercising his and
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:51.840]  and that was really even the guy made a joke out of it right that was the way
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:55.840]  now this you see this kind of stuff and you look at this and you see this
[02:10:55.840 --> 02:11:00.280]  violence I mean people are really getting hurt you know and they and a lot
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:03.240]  of people think this just started in Charlottesville this didn't start in
[02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:06.560]  Charlottesville this started in Berkeley you know this started on the
[02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:11.680]  streets of DC and the performer hearts of supposed free speech I mean what I
[02:11:11.680 --> 02:11:16.760]  don't want to see you know I see it goes from Richard Spencer to any kid in a
[02:11:16.760 --> 02:11:21.120]  MAGA hat and you know and next it's you or me well listen I told the story
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:25.480]  since the campaign I never got it on tape till Seattle they walk up in a
[02:11:25.480 --> 02:11:28.440]  restaurant in front of your family and they knock your drink over or they
[02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:32.960]  throw it on and I because first it was f you then it's knock your drink over or
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:36.360]  throw something at you and then now it's punched you in the back of the head I
[02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:43.840]  had a guy in Hawaii not the this last time the time before big guy and I was
[02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:46.520]  just smart enough not to do it walk by slap me in the back of the head and call
[02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:50.200]  me a Nazi and so didn't catch it on tape never really told the story till now
[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:54.360]  but this is what's going on and it's getting bad it is and you know and and
[02:11:54.360 --> 02:12:00.200]  here's the problem is that the natural reaction is to show up with shields and
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:06.160]  helmets and fight back and you know it's hard to tell somebody don't do that
[02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:10.120]  but I think that not reacting the same way you know I think the biggest
[02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:14.480]  strength that conservatives can have is don't react the same way and you know
[02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:18.280]  maybe that means you got to take a punch and turn the other cheek I mean I'm
[02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:22.280]  not the most Christian guy in the world but if if that's the lesson you have to
[02:12:22.280 --> 02:12:26.440]  learn because well I mean I was sitting there I don't see us rise to a level of
[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:31.160]  actual civil war and right now when I look at this and I look at people
[02:12:31.160 --> 02:12:37.720]  attacking one another in the streets men attacking women oh yeah look Antifa I
[02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:41.000]  mean I you know I I know you don't like cussing in your show so I won't say
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:45.080]  exactly what I think of them but bring it on I tell it I'll let you say it but
[02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:49.720]  but but we'll delay it for TV and radio that's all right now I won't but you know
[02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:53.960]  those those guys are a bunch of wooses I mean you kidding you're gonna show up
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:58.600]  with a mask over your face to it yeah to attack kids and women because you think
[02:12:58.600 --> 02:13:03.640]  that your politics are so damn correct or so damn righteous that that gives you
[02:13:03.640 --> 02:13:07.960]  the right to cross the violence words divide dead wrong well look at how these
[02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:12.280]  guys walk like they're so tough but meanwhile anytime a man fights them they
[02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:15.920]  get laid on their ass oh yeah I mean you know they didn't have a mask over their
[02:13:15.920 --> 02:13:20.920]  face I'll say what these are is usually street rat method criminals or rich kids
[02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:24.400]  because we've we've I mean look at him beating up that woman and so these are
[02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:29.520]  guys that that are just the scum of the earth I don't know what's really
[02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:33.120]  troubling about it as you've seen some gov you know some local governments
[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:38.200]  almost endorse it oh Portland San Francisco and that is look the police
[02:13:38.200 --> 02:13:43.480]  are supposed to be there to stop this kind of thing and you know as a as I
[02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:47.120]  mean I like to consider myself a neutral observer of this because I'm not
[02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:51.360]  about to go out there with with shields and bats on either side of this and I'm
[02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:56.600]  certainly not identifying with antifa but when I see this happen whatever you
[02:13:56.600 --> 02:14:00.480]  know the way I used to see things like this is you'd see the police acting as
[02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:05.400]  a barrier so that the Nazis could but that's why they do it it's it's done in
[02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:08.840]  Seattle it's done in Portland it's done in San Francisco it's done in Austin
[02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:12.920]  because even in Austin the police to a certain extent they stand down yeah
[02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:17.040]  they're ordered to do it and so you got 10 to 1 leftist beating up a prayer
[02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:20.640]  vigil it's never even Nazis now because most the Nazis are fed run and you know
[02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:24.000]  provocateur the leader will be a fed the others are idiots but the other prayer
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:28.120]  vigil usually it's like Hispanic when black Christians you know a few white
[02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:32.040]  people standing up and then here come people beating them up calling them
[02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:38.800]  Nazis and it's a prayer vigil and it's just it's just insane to see the cowardice
[02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:43.000]  exactly in these blue cities where they got everything on their side and then a
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:47.960]  bunch of wobbly big-budded soy boys who came out of their World of Warcraft
[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:52.160]  basements to act like tough guys in Austin they come out with guns and
[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:55.600]  pointed them at Owen and said you're shaking aren't you boy and wouldn't
[02:14:55.600 --> 02:15:00.960]  let him into a park for an event yeah yeah this is I mean this is this is our
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:05.440]  reporter by himself out there with people saying we're gonna hurt you and
[02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:09.360]  hitting him with clubs right with guns and you know you you can't just say we
[02:15:09.360 --> 02:15:12.800]  know we're I mean what are you protecting if you're doing that like what is
[02:15:12.800 --> 02:15:17.880]  that it just horrifies me and what I'm worried about is you know I see I hear
[02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:21.840]  from a lot of conservatives that say well we're gonna go armed we're gonna go
[02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:25.080]  ready to defend ourselves we're gonna go ready to protect ourselves and it's
[02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:29.040]  it's hard to argue with that logic and then they're gonna get their Charlotte
[02:15:29.040 --> 02:15:34.320]  Phil event they want yeah and you know that was there's a horrible tragedy that
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:38.960]  happened there and what it's but it's the natural result well the police stood
[02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:43.080]  down and then they heard it the alt-right people most of them are just
[02:15:43.080 --> 02:15:46.680]  reporters covering the alt-right they heard it the very suspicious guys with

[02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:12.120]  in six months it's a lot of exciting things happening look if I can get more
[02:21:12.120 --> 02:21:16.160]  people to you know believe in the neutral principle of the first
[02:21:16.160 --> 02:21:20.200]  amendment I'm happy to do it it's exciting you know and and you know
[02:21:20.200 --> 02:21:24.120]  neutral principles of the first amendment do process and non-violence I
[02:21:24.120 --> 02:21:28.640]  mean if you can you know you convert one person to believe in those things then
[02:21:28.640 --> 02:21:33.000]  then I'm happy let me ask you this question knowing how people were being
[02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:36.000]  one of the top you know known trial lawyers out there for the first
[02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:39.880]  amendment and also one of the legal theorist guys that's that's quoted
[02:21:39.880 --> 02:21:44.120]  everywhere looking at this fight with the left committing to be anti-free
[02:21:44.120 --> 02:21:49.120]  speech looking at the left really becoming everything they claim they're
[02:21:49.120 --> 02:21:53.400]  opposing and being financed by a lot of big corporations cold-bloodedly who
[02:21:53.400 --> 02:21:56.440]  want to control this country because they don't want Trump doing populist
[02:21:56.440 --> 02:21:59.720]  things that are good for the people now that's what he does he's fired all the
[02:21:59.720 --> 02:22:03.040]  lobbyist everything it's just incredible how selfless it is and I'm not
[02:22:03.040 --> 02:22:06.760]  somebody to grovel at somebody's feet it's just true and I've been persecuted
[02:22:06.760 --> 02:22:11.800]  for the truth as well to sit there and see that mark and disagree if you want
[02:22:11.800 --> 02:22:15.240]  to obviously at a gut level how do you see this fight ending I mean it's up to
[02:22:15.240 --> 02:22:19.360]  all of us but I just know we're in an epic struggle right now and the left
[02:22:19.360 --> 02:22:23.440]  because they've lost is like trying all these things that no one else does
[02:22:23.440 --> 02:22:28.000]  because attacking women and children and old people gets you totally discredited
[02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:32.520]  or killed and I'm not saying I'm gonna kill you I'm just saying the road they're
[02:22:32.520 --> 02:22:36.040]  going down is a villainous and I don't understand why they don't see it's
[02:22:36.040 --> 02:22:39.600]  hurting them look I got I got two predictions I got an optimistic one
[02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:45.440]  and pessimistic one for a long time the right is where the cold wind blew from
[02:22:45.440 --> 02:22:49.920]  you know the right didn't want communist speech and First Amendment lawyers
[02:22:49.920 --> 02:22:54.840]  defended the communists defended pornographers and we defended people
[02:22:54.840 --> 02:23:00.000]  that the right and the religious wanted to shut down unpopular religious views
[02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:05.920]  what have you now that polarity has flipped and I'm looking at this is such
[02:23:05.920 --> 02:23:09.960]  a great opportunity because when I can talk to right-wing people and they are
[02:23:09.960 --> 02:23:14.440]  all starting to dig down deep and hold on to that marketplace of ideas that
[02:23:14.440 --> 02:23:19.800]  Oliver Wendell Holmesian view of the of of a robust First Amendment and I say
[02:23:19.800 --> 02:23:25.080]  great now stay put and keeping them put there because it's going to change the
[02:23:25.080 --> 02:23:28.600]  wind is going to change and then it's going to be from the other side I agree
[02:23:28.600 --> 02:23:32.920]  here's the problem I keep enough people staying put on that ground when then
[02:23:32.920 --> 02:23:37.760]  left-wing speech gets attacked again maybe we wind up one day and I can look
[02:23:37.760 --> 02:23:40.960]  around at a crowd of people and I got leftists and rightists and I've got
[02:23:40.960 --> 02:23:45.080]  communists and fascists all sitting together saying okay we disagree on
[02:23:45.080 --> 02:23:49.800]  all this stuff but we agree on freedom of expression and that is that's like
[02:23:49.800 --> 02:23:53.360]  that's the dream of America that's the Eagles blood you know that's that's
[02:23:53.360 --> 02:23:57.120]  what this is that's what fuels the country that's that's what we are man I
[02:23:57.120 --> 02:24:03.000]  mean look if we are not the Constitution America is not a country like any
[02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:08.160]  other alright you know in we're not an ethnic state we're not all relate I
[02:24:08.160 --> 02:24:11.480]  mean I have nothing in common ethnically with a native Hawaiian or
[02:24:11.480 --> 02:24:14.280]  somebody who's so what we have is the Bill of Rights the Constitution and the
[02:24:14.280 --> 02:24:17.920]  fact that just a little bit of that made us so successful it shows the
[02:24:17.920 --> 02:24:22.160]  marketplace of ideas is king and that people will in a real free market go
[02:24:22.160 --> 02:24:26.040]  with what's best so anybody that thinks they're promoting what is the answer you
[02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:29.360]  should support free speech because you're going to win right America is an
[02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:34.840]  idea it is that idea and you know if we lose that then what are we we're
[02:24:34.840 --> 02:24:38.600]  nothing we really mean nothing now that's the positive you only get the
[02:24:38.600 --> 02:24:43.060]  negative but but negative is is much worse okay I see that it could go the
[02:24:43.060 --> 02:24:47.640]  other way because what we have is people increasingly now I hear people on the
[02:24:47.640 --> 02:24:52.120]  right saying let's treat the left the way they treat us let's beat them at
[02:24:52.120 --> 02:24:54.680]  their own that's where I was trying to go and interrupt it because I see the
[02:24:54.680 --> 02:24:59.000]  right wing going well if you censor them for their speech then you got a
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:02.760]  censor the other side adopting it now becoming the police of it and that's
[02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:06.000]  what I'm worried about you know I'm really worried because it's a natural
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:10.560]  human reaction is hey you guys want to do it to us we're sick of it we're gonna
[02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:15.960]  do it to you and then you break the ideal down and all we are is divided into
[02:25:15.960 --> 02:25:19.440]  tribes and then tribes divide into violence and next thing you know
[02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:22.920]  country's collapse every civil war starts this way and I'm not saying there's a
[02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:27.960]  civil war coming I'm just saying even now we're in like a very cold civil war
[02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:32.480]  and I hate seeing that you know I believe in what this country is supposed to
[02:25:32.480 --> 02:25:37.120]  stand for and I want people to come around to say you know let's let's stick
[02:25:37.120 --> 02:25:40.160]  with that neutral principle and by the way you're absolutely right and there
[02:25:40.160 --> 02:25:45.320]  are outside corporate and international powers on record fomenting this communist
[02:25:45.320 --> 02:25:49.080]  China owns most of Hollywood now they're fomenting all this race war crap all this
[02:25:49.080 --> 02:25:52.800]  man against woman stuff that the weakest minds are buying into and I don't know
[02:25:52.800 --> 02:25:57.240]  how I tell an average leftist at Antifa call themselves mal youth brigades when
[02:25:57.240 --> 02:25:59.640]  they take their black off the early communist I video of it all of the
[02:25:59.640 --> 02:26:04.160]  country Mao and it's like dude Mao Mao they kill Buddhist they put them in
[02:26:04.160 --> 02:26:08.360]  communist China is a nightmare for people why would you be endorsing that
[02:26:08.360 --> 02:26:12.000]  yeah yeah I remember when I was in college it was a group of Maoists so
[02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:15.360]  what's wrong with you I can see you being a Leninist or I can see you
[02:26:15.360 --> 02:26:19.680]  believing in communism that look every philosophy is something in it worth
[02:26:19.680 --> 02:26:25.280]  learning from even communism but Maoism what is wrong with you look there's no
[02:26:25.280 --> 02:26:29.600]  pull you know maybe a pull pot brigade would be a little more ridiculous but yeah
[02:26:29.600 --> 02:26:32.440]  well that's because you're actually are an intellectual actually know about Mao I
[02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:35.000]  mean it was the biggest failure the Chinese say it was he killed 80 plus
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:38.360]  million people it's a total frickin nightmare but they choose like the
[02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:42.080]  worst thing because it started on college campuses and then they took over
[02:26:42.080 --> 02:26:46.880]  with young people bullying everyone else I'm telling you this anti-famove is a
[02:26:46.880 --> 02:26:50.840]  Maoist attack but they're all about deception oh we're anti-fascists no
[02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:54.680]  they're Maoist so I can take you to UT right now or I can take you to
[02:26:54.680 --> 02:26:58.800]  Southwest Texas any universities within 20 miles and I'm telling you they are
[02:26:58.800 --> 02:27:02.640]  we've gone to their meetings we've infiltrated them they are Maoists they
[02:27:02.640 --> 02:27:08.000]  actually prayed a mouse attack it's just absurd I mean I there's I can
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:13.080]  understand any kind you know the allure of some extreme philosophies it's always
[02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:17.520]  gonna be alluring to some 15 year old kids 16 year old kid 19 year old kid I
[02:27:17.520 --> 02:27:21.520]  mean it's that that's when you're exploring oh my god you're right yeah
[02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:25.040]  but now I mean that's you know Mao and child molestation are probably the two
[02:27:25.040 --> 02:27:29.960]  things and I'm like there's no reason to experiment with those so look my
[02:27:29.960 --> 02:27:36.360]  pessimistic view is we have people who just simply divide into tribes we decide
[02:27:36.360 --> 02:27:40.900]  that as that win changes next thing you know we use the tricks the right uses
[02:27:40.900 --> 02:27:43.680]  the tricks that the left was using the left uses the tricks the right was
[02:27:43.680 --> 02:27:48.000]  using and then we have nobody left in the middle saying let's defend this one
[02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:53.100]  principle so you might what I what I'm finding so difficult to do though is to
[02:27:53.100 --> 02:27:56.760]  yell at people on the right and say just stay where you are if the left had
[02:27:56.760 --> 02:28:00.320]  done that you know back when they were defending communist speech they were
[02:28:00.320 --> 02:28:04.320]  defending porn they were they were the ones who were really you know allowing
[02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:08.520]  religious liberty you know getting rid of compelled speech I mean we owe the
[02:28:08.520 --> 02:28:12.720]  left so much when it comes to protection of freedom of expression but you can
[02:28:12.720 --> 02:28:15.600]  argue because they're just here they were only doing it to undermine the
[02:28:15.600 --> 02:28:19.120]  existing structure once they got in they try to block it look I don't care why
[02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:22.920]  they were doing it I care what they did and you know we owe if you believe in
[02:28:22.920 --> 02:28:29.640]  the First Amendment like its heritage is leftist but now I I'm just shocked when
[02:28:29.640 --> 02:28:33.880]  I see people who you know ten years ago would have said something completely
[02:28:33.880 --> 02:28:37.400]  different now saying well maybe the First Amendment isn't such a great thing or
[02:28:37.400 --> 02:28:43.440]  hell they're they're saying they want to basically repeal it in the cases against

[02:33:24.440 --> 02:33:35.480]  resistance to tyrants his obedience to god it's alex jones so brandon
[02:33:35.480 --> 02:33:39.680]  struck is a gay hairdresser from new york and the founder of hashtag walk
[02:33:39.680 --> 02:33:43.800]  away from the top hashtags last two weeks and a movement that calls for
[02:33:43.800 --> 02:33:47.520]  walking with a democratic party of violence intolerance divisiveness and
[02:33:47.520 --> 02:33:51.000]  hatred and you've got state reps doing it you've got congress folks talking about
[02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:54.480]  it got Alan Dershowitz talking about leaving the party until they stop
[02:33:54.480 --> 02:34:01.400]  acting like crazy maniacs I mean it's just crazy so brandon joins us again
[02:34:01.400 --> 02:34:06.920]  hashtag walk away you can see his twitter there on screen and he recently went
[02:34:06.920 --> 02:34:11.240]  into an electronic store and they wouldn't sell a microphone saying that
[02:34:11.240 --> 02:34:15.960]  he they thought he was quote alt right so this is very very dangerous precedent
[02:34:15.960 --> 02:34:19.320]  we've seen fox news reporters obviously run out of the supreme court building
[02:34:19.320 --> 02:34:23.040]  last night by angry crowds we've seen the physical attacks the calls for
[02:34:23.040 --> 02:34:28.200]  kidnapping and raping baron by hollywood stars it's just a very vicious
[02:34:28.200 --> 02:34:33.000]  climate antifa beating people up all over the place I mean the republicans
[02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:36.800]  acted like this I wouldn't even support the republican party I was arrested
[02:34:36.800 --> 02:34:40.120]  twice by George W. Bush for asking questions at press conferences and
[02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:45.440]  thought that he was a horrible person and I I still do so I'm a libertarian but I
[02:34:45.440 --> 02:34:49.120]  like Trump because he's turning the country around but enough from me brandon
[02:34:49.120 --> 02:34:56.320]  strock joins us at US minority or us minority and there's so much to talk
[02:34:56.320 --> 02:35:00.560]  about he's in London and I just appreciate his courage because living in
[02:35:00.560 --> 02:35:05.160]  New York and doing what he does particularly being you know a former
[02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:09.480]  democrat and then you know still I would guess a liberal is what they're really
[02:35:09.480 --> 02:35:14.040]  afraid of they really bully people they really attack people that are free
[02:35:14.040 --> 02:35:18.680]  thinkers and aren't being inducted into this cult by successive approximation so
[02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:24.040]  Brandon thanks for coming on with us thank you for having me where should we
[02:35:24.040 --> 02:35:27.160]  start I mean start at the beginning and then just go through what's happened the
[02:35:27.160 --> 02:35:30.440]  last few weeks as your movement has become so huge I think because it
[02:35:30.440 --> 02:35:36.400]  strikes on the nerve of many liberals I know many progressives who now are
[02:35:36.400 --> 02:35:42.760]  abandoning the democratic party well you know I was a lifelong democrat I was
[02:35:42.760 --> 02:35:47.920]  always a liberal and I after the election of Donald Trump I saw a lot of
[02:35:47.920 --> 02:35:52.640]  things that really opened my eyes to how dishonest the media had been during
[02:35:52.640 --> 02:35:59.080]  his campaign and how even more dishonest they were after his election and that
[02:35:59.080 --> 02:36:04.320]  would have been bad enough on its own I think but as a gay man I think where the
[02:36:04.320 --> 02:36:09.520]  line was really crossed for me was it became very very clear that the media
[02:36:09.520 --> 02:36:16.360]  was using minorities by telling us you know putting out these stories that were
[02:36:16.360 --> 02:36:20.760]  designed to kind of terrify us and keep us in this you know they were selling
[02:36:20.760 --> 02:36:25.000]  fear it was just fear mongering and it took a little while to figure that out
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:28.240]  and it took the help of some you know people that were close to me pointing
[02:36:28.240 --> 02:36:31.440]  that out to me well once I saw it was one of those things that you can't ever
[02:36:31.440 --> 02:36:37.480]  unsee and so I started trying to kind of speak out about this to other people from
[02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:41.280]  two different perspectives one was you know people were running around literally
[02:36:41.280 --> 02:36:44.160]  hysterical saying we have a Nazi in the White House we have a Nazi in the White
[02:36:44.160 --> 02:36:48.000]  House he's staffing his administration full of you know KKK and I'm thinking to
[02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:51.440]  myself well you know I'm discovering that this actually isn't true so I'm
[02:36:51.440 --> 02:36:55.360]  approaching people and saying look things aren't as bad as they seem this
[02:36:55.360 --> 02:36:58.200]  thing that you're so upset about this thing you're so angry and worked up
[02:36:58.200 --> 02:37:03.320]  about actually it's kind of being made up by the media but what I was met with
[02:37:03.320 --> 02:37:07.480]  was not people going oh thank goodness you've showed me something that you know
[02:37:07.480 --> 02:37:12.000]  makes it so that I don't have to be so upset they were upset with me for
[02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:15.240]  bringing them evidence that you know Trump's actually not such a horrible
[02:37:15.240 --> 02:37:18.160]  human being after all and maybe we don't have a Nazi in the White House I
[02:37:18.160 --> 02:37:21.360]  started to think well this is pretty peculiar it's almost as though they just
[02:37:21.360 --> 02:37:25.400]  want to hate him you know it's people don't want to be presented with evidence
[02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:30.480]  that shows that you know things aren't as bad as they seem well the more people
[02:37:30.480 --> 02:37:35.720]  started turning on me and unfriending me saying nasty things to me dragging my
[02:37:35.720 --> 02:37:38.360]  reputation through the mud I thought you know I'm not gonna put up with this I'm
[02:37:38.360 --> 02:37:42.760]  gonna fight back and I sat down and I wrote what I call kind of the
[02:37:42.760 --> 02:37:47.240]  definitive manifesto of everything that's wrong with liberalism and the
[02:37:47.240 --> 02:37:51.200]  Democrat Party and the reason why they're involved is because all of these
[02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:54.520]  politicians that I had trusted for so long who I thought actually cared about
[02:37:54.520 --> 02:37:58.600]  me cared about my community they went along with all of this you know I mean
[02:37:58.600 --> 02:38:03.280]  they everything every lie that the media put out every false story or every
[02:38:03.280 --> 02:38:07.240]  omission they were right there anytime there was a microphone in their hand to
[02:38:07.240 --> 02:38:12.080]  back it up and say oh yes oh yes he's expected to sign an executive order
[02:38:12.080 --> 02:38:16.120]  taking all of your rights away this week we're doing what we can to stop it you
[02:38:16.120 --> 02:38:20.280]  know they went right along with all the fear mongering so I created this video
[02:38:20.280 --> 02:38:23.760]  and I created a movement which is basically encouraging people to walk
[02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:28.080]  away from the Democrat Party walk away from liberalism I'm not telling anyone
[02:38:28.080 --> 02:38:31.840]  where to go if they end up finding themselves on the right like I have
[02:38:31.840 --> 02:38:38.280]  great I now with my registered Republican and after a lot of research and you
[02:38:38.280 --> 02:38:43.600]  know really really digging deep I'm a Trump supporter now and I can't wait to
[02:38:43.600 --> 02:38:47.320]  vote for him in 2020 but you know I'm not telling anyone where to go or what to
[02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:50.680]  believe or what to do I'm saying open your eyes do your own research and at the
[02:38:50.680 --> 02:38:57.320]  very least look at the toxic divisiveness hostility and now basically
[02:38:57.320 --> 02:39:03.200]  call very close to if not exactly calling for violence on the left and get
[02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:07.920]  away from it well exactly but take take Donald Trump because there's obviously
[02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:11.000]  been some you know anti-gay bigot is tough it's called the Republican Party
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:15.360]  before but that's gone away the last few decades but Trump with Peter Thiel who
[02:39:15.360 --> 02:39:20.160]  got outed by the liberals because he wouldn't be their minion and then he's
[02:39:20.160 --> 02:39:23.440]  out there and you got Donald Trump saying let's all be together and let's all be
[02:39:23.440 --> 02:39:27.360]  friends which everybody should applaud the media wouldn't even cover it and
[02:39:27.360 --> 02:39:33.520]  they said Trump's anti-LGBT at his convention and just none it's the
[02:39:33.520 --> 02:39:38.000]  lying and that's why so many people like Candice Owens she had the feminist
[02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:43.480]  movement online stalking her she confirmed posing as right-wing males
[02:39:43.480 --> 02:39:47.360]  harassing her and she learned it was them using it to steer because she was
[02:39:47.360 --> 02:39:52.280]  smart good-looking like you to steer her under their control it's a cult and when
[02:39:52.280 --> 02:39:58.520]  you find out well you're trying to program me to sit there and hate other
[02:39:58.520 --> 02:40:02.480]  people and be your slave I mean it may make it from folks I've talked to like
[02:40:02.480 --> 02:40:07.200]  Candice it makes you mad oh yeah it makes me very angry makes it very angry and
[02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:13.640]  it's you know and you know when I became a liberal I thought it was because you
[02:40:13.640 --> 02:40:17.840]  know I wanted to be around other people you know I had always heard you know
[02:40:17.840 --> 02:40:21.880]  everybody on the right is very racist everybody on the right is you know very
[02:40:21.880 --> 02:40:26.320]  small-minded and bigoted you know I believe these messages that I heard
[02:40:26.320 --> 02:40:32.680]  from the left and whether it was ever true or not at this point it's safe to
[02:40:32.680 --> 02:40:38.240]  say we have very much over corrected and at this point all of those things that
[02:40:38.240 --> 02:40:42.640]  I became a liberal to fight against liberalism now is you know I mean it's
[02:40:42.640 --> 02:40:47.760]  just a constant hostility towards white people it's constant hostility towards
[02:40:47.760 --> 02:40:53.560]  men there's this bizarre push to sort of demonize heteronormativity and and
[02:40:53.560 --> 02:40:58.400]  myself as a gay man it's you know it's not even about gay rights anymore it's
[02:40:58.400 --> 02:41:04.560]  now about adding all of these bizarre sub acronyms your LGBTQ I don't know what
[02:41:04.560 --> 02:41:09.000]  gender fluid means I don't know what two-spirit means I don't know what gender
[02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:14.200]  non-binary is but I'm told all the time now that as a gay man I'm privileged and
[02:41:14.200 --> 02:41:20.440]  that you know these other non-binary gender fluid people in my community are
[02:41:20.440 --> 02:41:26.080]  victims of oppression and that I am a privileged white gay man so I should
[02:41:26.080 --> 02:41:31.760]  shut my mouth and march along with what they tell me to do and then you learn
[02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:35.920]  the Tabastog Institute cooked it all up it's it's it's mind control and they're
[02:41:35.920 --> 02:41:40.720]  using America's openness and the fact that we are a very classically liberal
[02:41:40.720 --> 02:41:45.160]  society against us and then bringing in authoritarianism as the answer to free
[02:41:45.160 --> 02:41:50.680]  people and really all it is is classic fog of war confusion but look I can tell
[02:41:50.680 --> 02:41:54.400]  what they're scared of you I mean you're very articulate and you've got a lot of
[02:41:54.400 --> 02:41:57.440]  charisma and I think you should be very very careful I know you've already been
[02:41:57.440 --> 02:41:59.560]  threatened and stuff we'll talk about when we come back it's not about
[02:41:59.560 --> 02:42:02.720]  victimology I get threatened and attacked too but let me tell you they're
[02:42:02.720 --> 02:42:05.880]  scared of you because you are you're a good-looking guy you're articulate you're
[02:42:05.880 --> 02:42:10.480]  telling the truth we're about to go to break but how much harassment have you
[02:42:10.480 --> 02:42:16.720]  dealt with well it's been I've actually been dealt with more harassment on a
[02:42:16.720 --> 02:42:19.840]  personal level than on a public level the public level I guess I don't really
[02:42:19.840 --> 02:42:24.400]  care about that much I just sort of disregard those messages but some
[02:42:24.400 --> 02:42:27.400]  really nasty stuff from people who have known me for a long long time and
[02:42:27.400 --> 02:42:32.000]  should know better exactly so you've had family you've had friends turn on you

[02:43:53.400 --> 02:43:58.440]  full wars life calm living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is
[02:43:58.440 --> 02:44:03.040]  the real drama can be found here in Leilani estates but a lot of us on the
[02:44:03.040 --> 02:44:07.680]  big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid
[02:44:07.680 --> 02:44:13.160]  rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower
[02:44:13.160 --> 02:44:17.960]  the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of
[02:44:17.960 --> 02:44:23.720]  tests for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in
[02:44:23.720 --> 02:44:28.640]  fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we
[02:44:28.640 --> 02:44:32.920]  tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the
[02:44:32.920 --> 02:44:38.200]  heavy metal levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal
[02:44:38.200 --> 02:44:43.760]  levels as it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water
[02:44:43.760 --> 02:44:48.480]  so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a
[02:44:48.480 --> 02:44:53.320]  rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will
[02:44:53.320 --> 02:44:55.880]  purify it

[02:47:21.720 --> 02:47:27.600]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the
[02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:31.660]  GCN radio network
[02:47:34.600 --> 02:47:40.160]  and the Trump gives every indication by what he says and what he does and what
[02:47:40.160 --> 02:47:54.680]  he doesn't do that he's mean as a Wolverine it's 1159 radio free America
[02:47:54.680 --> 02:47:58.760]  and this is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn right now I got a few
[02:47:58.760 --> 02:48:02.560]  words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone the chair is
[02:48:02.560 --> 02:48:08.840]  against the wall the chair is against the wall John has a long mustache John has
[02:48:08.840 --> 02:48:13.400]  a long mustache it's 12 o'clock American another day closer to victory and for
[02:48:13.400 --> 02:48:19.040]  all of you out there on a behind the lines this is your song
[02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:26.040]  but they took a lot of people away people that they thought we're gonna make
[02:48:26.040 --> 02:48:29.200]  trouble for them people that had guns and things they wanted they just took
[02:48:29.200 --> 02:48:35.160]  them away where we education can't say they call it so part of the race you
[02:48:35.160 --> 02:48:39.040]  are kind of the private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong
[02:48:39.040 --> 02:48:43.280]  to their families recognize kids belong to the whole community I have decided
[02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:55.360]  we really need camps for adults all persons of Japanese descent were required
[02:48:55.360 --> 02:48:59.120]  to register now they were taken to racetracks and fairgrounds where the
[02:48:59.120 --> 02:49:06.920]  army almost overnight had built assembly centers what kind of a situation in the
[02:49:06.920 --> 02:49:14.560]  US would you see that happening I mean we've got a lot of people that are
[02:49:14.560 --> 02:49:18.200]  coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to to build
[02:49:18.200 --> 02:49:24.760]  IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques these people are radicalized
[02:49:24.760 --> 02:49:28.560]  and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United
[02:49:28.560 --> 02:49:33.120]  States it's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal
[02:49:33.120 --> 02:49:35.440]  community
[02:49:39.560 --> 02:49:44.080]  this is what we're doing here unless not hit about it we're building a domestic
[02:49:44.080 --> 02:49:48.640]  army because the government is afraid of its own citizens put your gun down
[02:49:48.640 --> 02:49:56.920]  really rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's Alex
[02:49:56.920 --> 02:50:01.800]  Jones are you some kind of a constitutionalist
[02:50:10.120 --> 02:50:19.200]  from if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[02:50:19.200 --> 02:50:24.200]  America's prize in a bunch of multinational corporations are using race
[02:50:24.200 --> 02:50:27.840]  war culture war to the WikiLeaks and turn us against each other doesn't mean
[02:50:27.840 --> 02:50:31.280]  those there isn't racism or any that stuff going on it means that there are
[02:50:31.280 --> 02:50:37.120]  people exacerbating it let me tell you Brandon Strock of the walk away movement
[02:50:37.120 --> 02:50:40.120]  that's just been out for two weeks it's being demonized and attacked by the
[02:50:40.120 --> 02:50:45.760]  entire left and let me tell you I know when destiny happens I know at a gut
[02:50:45.760 --> 02:50:51.760]  level when I've just heard the answer so as soon as I get off air here and Paul
[02:50:51.760 --> 02:50:56.920]  Watson takes over 15 minutes from London where guests just happens to be I am
[02:50:56.920 --> 02:51:01.160]  gonna get on the phone the bat phone and I never call the bat phone believe me
[02:51:01.160 --> 02:51:04.200]  they're gonna answer because I never call when I call it's always you know
[02:51:04.200 --> 02:51:08.400]  important and get them on the phone with this gentleman because because I know
[02:51:08.400 --> 02:51:15.160]  when I heard it that it was victory to unify America to stop the Civil War he
[02:51:15.160 --> 02:51:17.320]  wasn't gonna announce it today but he's gonna go ahead and get into some of it
[02:51:17.320 --> 02:51:20.040]  he won't get into behind-the-scenes stuff but I know this has been brought to
[02:51:20.040 --> 02:51:23.200]  the president but you can't do much to the White House because that's so
[02:51:23.200 --> 02:51:25.560]  controlled because the national security issues you got to do it through the
[02:51:25.560 --> 02:51:31.080]  campaign so Brandon please lay out what you said and then also how they're
[02:51:31.080 --> 02:51:34.040]  attacking you and you know they're ridiculous just info because when
[02:51:34.040 --> 02:51:38.440]  people walk away from the Democrats and in capitals across the country and in
[02:51:38.440 --> 02:51:43.440]  DC come together and hug each other left and right for a future of America and
[02:51:43.440 --> 02:51:47.840]  the Antifa shows up there's only a half dozen of them it is going to be Martin
[02:51:47.840 --> 02:51:52.280]  Luther King level I have a dream stuff I mean I just know destiny I hear it so
[02:51:52.280 --> 02:51:58.040]  you're asking my advice I think you should tell people your millennium level
[02:51:58.040 --> 02:52:01.920]  idea I mean it's it's like one of those ideas that you only hear a few times in
[02:52:01.920 --> 02:52:05.360]  a lifetime and usually people ignore it this is history and that's why there's
[02:52:05.360 --> 02:52:10.480]  just so please tell folks the idea you came up with yeah you got it Alex um so
[02:52:10.480 --> 02:52:14.480]  so you know a lot of what's coming out of left right now is this narrative that
[02:52:14.480 --> 02:52:18.000]  my campaign is Russian bots which is absolutely ridiculous of course we have
[02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:21.040]  real people giving testimonials for the walk away campaign but it's sort of
[02:52:21.040 --> 02:52:24.200]  sparked an idea in my mind since there's gonna be a lot of naysayers out there
[02:52:24.200 --> 02:52:27.160]  who are going to try to dismiss this campaign and what's happening with walk
[02:52:27.160 --> 02:52:32.280]  away as bots and as not real I thought to myself you know what we really need to
[02:52:32.280 --> 02:52:39.520]  do is I'm going to organize a walk away march on Washington a nationwide walk
[02:52:39.520 --> 02:52:45.080]  away march and what this is going to be is really unifying people from the left
[02:52:45.080 --> 02:52:48.360]  unifying people from the right bringing everybody together kind of on the same
[02:52:48.360 --> 02:52:52.560]  page and listen if you're not walking away from the Democrat Party that's fine
[02:52:52.560 --> 02:52:55.240]  but I think that at this point people should at least be willing to say I'm
[02:52:55.240 --> 02:52:58.960]  walking away from the hatefulness I'm walking away from the divisiveness I'm
[02:52:58.960 --> 02:53:04.760]  walking away from the violent rhetoric and the division so this is what I want
[02:53:04.760 --> 02:53:10.160]  to do I want to in the fall have a an amazing demonstration organization
[02:53:10.160 --> 02:53:14.840]  nationwide where we do a nationwide march on Washington I want it to be the
[02:53:14.840 --> 02:53:20.240]  biggest most incredible and most powerful March this nation has ever seen I
[02:53:20.240 --> 02:53:24.000]  totally agree and like you said you need the president to get involved that
[02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:26.640]  will make it all happen quicker but they're gonna try to launch a summer of
[02:53:26.640 --> 02:53:32.200]  rage and civil war in their own words so I think at least the first level of the
[02:53:32.200 --> 02:53:37.960]  march where you know in New York or DC or or wherever you pick to as a
[02:53:37.960 --> 02:53:42.560]  prototype have the police out everything and just have it be a march of unity to
[02:53:42.560 --> 02:53:46.000]  support the First Amendment and progress for America does he mean you're walking
[02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.880]  away from the Democrats you mean and for some of the right wing doesn't mean
[02:53:48.880 --> 02:53:52.360]  stuff too I'm not perfect and because my turn which is on a few weeks ago and he
[02:53:52.360 --> 02:53:56.160]  says he's a smart guy he said he felt it just like a couple years ago a new
[02:53:56.160 --> 02:54:00.560]  Trump win just like I did he had he has this image of not attacking the left
[02:54:00.560 --> 02:54:04.520]  anymore even when they attack us but just trying to hug them like Kanye West has
[02:54:04.520 --> 02:54:07.320]  been talking about and of course they'll still be haters but I agree
[02:54:07.320 --> 02:54:11.840]  check mating these globalists trying to make us all these social engineers fight
[02:54:11.840 --> 02:54:16.400]  with each other and just having a march where we're all over here and this is
[02:54:16.400 --> 02:54:20.920]  our side liberal conservative whatever we're gonna hug we're gonna call for
[02:54:20.920 --> 02:54:24.680]  unity we're gonna call for not being violent and then let the haters be over
[02:54:24.680 --> 02:54:28.880]  here and I think it's gonna be so clear that it's gonna devastate him but here's
[02:54:28.880 --> 02:54:32.920]  the deal you think they're after you now this idea your leadership why did not
[02:54:32.920 --> 02:54:36.800]  think of this they're really gonna come after you now and I'm not just saying
[02:54:36.800 --> 02:54:41.440]  that I know in my gut level so I asked you I said do you have a Kickstarter or
[02:54:41.440 --> 02:54:45.160]  go fund me yeah we just set it up I said listen even before he came on I said
[02:54:45.160 --> 02:54:47.440]  you know I want to make a $10,000 donation I've got a lot of money this
[02:54:47.440 --> 02:54:50.640]  fella because I can tell what he's doing really scares them and it's really good
[02:54:50.640 --> 02:54:54.560]  and then once I heard you say yeah when what do I do I need to talk to the
[02:54:54.560 --> 02:54:58.680]  president I need to try to get some help we need to help you right now so you've
[02:54:58.680 --> 02:55:02.680]  just launched you know a a funding operation trying to get some basic
[02:55:02.680 --> 02:55:05.920]  money for this you need to be flooded folks and believe me I know at a gut
[02:55:05.920 --> 02:55:10.400]  level what's gonna work and what's not so if people fund this I couldn't see a
[02:55:10.400 --> 02:55:13.920]  better place for people to do it so I'm pledging 10,000 that will donate right

[03:00:32.560 --> 03:00:36.840]  make all these lines up I don't be able to come together in mass rallies but we've
[03:00:36.840 --> 03:00:41.120]  been talking about this and I can tell you I know the White House is already on

[03:00:50.800 --> 03:00:54.240]  the four minutes we have left Brandon what else you want to impart to people
[03:00:54.240 --> 03:00:59.600]  about your vision and and and really this quick the this this shift we're
[03:00:59.600 --> 03:01:03.920]  seeing not just by you but when I go to the mall I get mobbed by minorities
[03:01:03.920 --> 03:01:07.440]  blacks Hispanics Asians they want to come together they want freedom they see
[03:01:07.440 --> 03:01:13.360]  through it I think libertarian conservatism americana is the new punk rock
[03:01:13.360 --> 03:01:19.280]  I absolutely agree I friends of mine and I always say that conservatism is the
[03:01:19.280 --> 03:01:23.160]  new counterculture it's actually so much more fun over here and it's actually so
[03:01:23.160 --> 03:01:27.920]  much more inclusive you know and and there's so much more actual love and
[03:01:27.920 --> 03:01:31.480]  tolerance happening on the right than there is on the left I mean I guess I
[03:01:31.480 --> 03:01:34.360]  think that's a good ending point right there you asked me what do I want to say
[03:01:34.360 --> 03:01:38.560]  I mean if I were to speak directly to my own community or even racial minorities
[03:01:38.560 --> 03:01:44.880]  in America you know I would say to these people look the people on the left and
[03:01:44.880 --> 03:01:47.680]  the Democrats want to try to tell you over and over again that they're on your
[03:01:47.680 --> 03:01:50.320]  side they're looking out for you that you're only safe with them but the truth
[03:01:50.320 --> 03:01:55.840]  of matter is they're actually using fear tactics to keep you in a constant state
[03:01:55.840 --> 03:01:59.400]  of terror so that you'll they can manipulate your behavior and that's not
[03:01:59.400 --> 03:02:03.800]  happening on the right in fact on the right I'm finding a lot of of love and
[03:02:03.800 --> 03:02:07.960]  warm embrace from from the whole community over here since I began the
[03:02:07.960 --> 03:02:12.160]  walk away campaign and I want I want minorities in America know to know that
[03:02:12.160 --> 03:02:15.920]  you have a choice you don't have to be a Democrat you don't have to be a liberal
[03:02:15.920 --> 03:02:19.840]  you actually have a seat at the table on the right there's a lot of really great
[03:02:19.840 --> 03:02:23.560]  people who would love to have you over on the right in the thinking class of
[03:02:23.560 --> 03:02:27.120]  people and I hope that people consider walking away and I like how you made the
[03:02:27.120 --> 03:02:31.000]  point beyond even walking away from the Democrats to be great the Democrats
[03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:35.680]  reformed themselves and became you know free thinkers again we need more than
[03:02:35.680 --> 03:02:39.160]  two parties not just one that's being half decent now it's very frightening
[03:02:39.160 --> 03:02:43.040]  we've only got one party halfway operating you know in reality because
[03:02:43.040 --> 03:02:46.480]  Republicans have their own problems is that just walk away from the Democrat
[03:02:46.480 --> 03:02:51.400]  cult walk away from the buses show up with the new kids go into college and
[03:02:51.400 --> 03:02:54.600]  they bring them in and go you got to be in our group this is the professors
[03:02:54.600 --> 03:02:57.760]  they're all out to get you there's Nazis on campus then they go spray paint
[03:02:57.760 --> 03:03:01.760]  swastikas on their dorm at night hundreds of times and get caught this
[03:03:01.760 --> 03:03:06.440]  is what they did to Candace Owens I mean it's like it's so authoritarian this is
[03:03:06.440 --> 03:03:12.200]  the new authoritarianism and people are rejecting it yes well I mean the other
[03:03:12.200 --> 03:03:20.000]  day I was refused service at a store by another gay man yeah so yeah and what do
[03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:24.200]  you say I think you're all right you're gonna use this for speech so you can't
[03:03:24.200 --> 03:03:28.240]  have it as if you're even all right that some Hillary Southern poverty loss
[03:03:28.240 --> 03:03:31.880]  center you know at I mean let me tell you almost all those Nazi leaders have
[03:03:31.880 --> 03:03:38.320]  been proven to be operative okay they're actors it stays I'm sorry I'm ranting
[03:03:38.320 --> 03:03:43.120]  it's just to say that you're all right or I'm all right is horsemen are I don't
[03:03:43.120 --> 03:03:46.840]  even know what alt-rate means I don't think anybody really knows what it means
[03:03:46.840 --> 03:03:50.560]  but I can tell you that I'm not all right I'm actually just a really good
[03:03:50.560 --> 03:03:54.880]  person I believe in equality for all people I believe in empowering all
[03:03:54.880 --> 03:03:59.400]  people in America whether they be black white straight gay I think everybody
[03:03:59.400 --> 03:04:03.760]  deserves an equal opportunity and an equal chance and that's what I'm about
[03:04:03.760 --> 03:04:10.000]  so I if that's all right then I don't know look at it Kanye just the energy
[03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:15.200]  and from you it's just a an energy of we're not gonna be controlled we're
[03:04:15.200 --> 03:04:18.400]  gonna move forward we're not gonna be inducted in this politically correct
[03:04:18.400 --> 03:04:24.520]  cult and that is that is universal that is unifying yeah absolutely I mean you
[03:04:24.520 --> 03:04:27.400]  know as gay people you know we kind of went through this civil rights struggle
[03:04:27.400 --> 03:04:30.400]  to you know we're fighting for you know marriage equality this and that we got
[03:04:30.400 --> 03:04:35.440]  that and this at in my opinion should be the most exciting time in anybody in
[03:04:35.440 --> 03:04:39.040]  the gay community's life because we're not even a wedge issue anymore nobody's
[03:04:39.040 --> 03:04:43.880]  our rights are not up for debate and so this should be a time where it's like
[03:04:43.880 --> 03:04:47.120]  we get to be full participants in the democratic state they're creating a new
[03:04:47.120 --> 03:04:49.800]  wedge and saying you're now part of the elite class let me say about you're in

[03:06:33.560 --> 03:06:38.400]  leftist authoritarian control freak or a right-wing control freak this in your
[03:06:38.400 --> 03:06:44.280]  show and I understand that we're trying to unify around believing in free market
[03:06:44.280 --> 03:06:47.760]  and religious freedom and economic freedom and we've got a big tent for
[03:06:47.760 --> 03:06:54.320]  everybody and we just had Brandon Strachan who has launched the hashtag
[03:06:54.320 --> 03:06:58.120]  walk away movement and the left just like they call me a Russian bot or
[03:06:58.120 --> 03:07:06.320]  Trump a Russian bot he then had the idea to have a nationwide march and he got
[03:07:06.320 --> 03:07:11.200]  it directly to the present I've been authorized to say that but then a few
[03:07:11.200 --> 03:07:20.920]  days went on and so I'm gonna try to get him ponied up hitched up with some
[03:07:20.920 --> 03:07:26.840]  folks and that's why I do a lot of this behind the scenes who can understand
[03:07:26.840 --> 03:07:32.080]  how big this is and I recommended how this should be done this is such a big
[03:07:32.080 --> 03:07:35.720]  deal I would have some Oprah Winfrey style deals in a control environment
[03:07:35.720 --> 03:07:38.400]  because the left's gonna try to infiltrate this for the left and right
[03:07:38.400 --> 03:07:42.120]  who don't agree with the left and all the race war to come together and say we
[03:07:42.120 --> 03:07:45.160]  believe in a future we believe in not having civil war we believe in not
[03:07:45.160 --> 03:07:50.240]  having violence if the president a chance to see it you know have everybody
[03:07:50.240 --> 03:07:54.560]  from Peter teal to you know you know from Judge Napolitano do you name it
[03:07:54.560 --> 03:07:59.240]  there because I the wizards never talking he just keeps walking I don't
[03:07:59.240 --> 03:08:02.920]  even need to be involved in I'm the bad guy that hits the barbed wire and says
[03:08:02.920 --> 03:08:06.320]  all the hard things and gets the attacks I don't even want to sit at that
[03:08:06.320 --> 03:08:10.800]  table you know I've been offered one I will not be there and that's my job I
[03:08:10.800 --> 03:08:14.960]  never talk I just keep walking even though I talk when I'm saying I'm
[03:08:14.960 --> 03:08:19.640]  always moving on to the next target so let me tell you I know zeitgeist when I
[03:08:19.640 --> 03:08:27.040]  see it I know victory when I see it this walk away thing is explosive and I was
[03:08:27.040 --> 03:08:33.720]  the mall this weekend and I was mobbed by Hispanic Americans mobbed because they
[03:08:33.720 --> 03:08:38.440]  know the media is pumpkin everybody in playing games and and then every walk
[03:08:38.440 --> 03:08:42.720]  in life guys with tattoos families you name it black families you name it but
[03:08:42.720 --> 03:08:46.160]  I saw some white people came over and shook my hand but it was me but I'd see
[03:08:46.160 --> 03:08:51.080]  liberals one and then they would get even more freaked out some of the
[03:08:51.080 --> 03:08:54.000]  liberal store clerk saw me sitting there taking photos with Hispanic family
[03:08:54.000 --> 03:08:59.280]  Hispanic family like six seven in a row and I saw some leftists just like they
[03:08:59.280 --> 03:09:03.600]  were looking and I even walked over my wife's like please don't turn your
[03:09:03.600 --> 03:09:08.000]  camera on I like let me guess you don't like me and the guy looks down he goes
[03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:17.120]  Alex I don't know what to think anymore see I took my daughter's we can have a
[03:09:17.120 --> 03:09:22.080]  go to camp and I pull up where they take to go to get all their trunks and their
[03:09:22.080 --> 03:09:25.520]  trunks off and all that it's all the young you know 60 70 18 year old camp
[03:09:25.520 --> 03:09:28.880]  counselors the males are there you know their evil gender role unloading the
[03:09:28.880 --> 03:09:34.440]  trunks and they're all listeners and then I go to take both my daughters to
[03:09:34.440 --> 03:09:39.320]  their camp separate areas this big complex and there's him full-war stickers
[03:09:39.320 --> 03:09:44.080]  I'm looking here they're Paul Watson they love him they love Steven Crowder we
[03:09:44.080 --> 03:09:50.520]  are so close to victory right now and thanks to Kanye and Drudge and and
[03:09:50.520 --> 03:09:55.800]  everybody and it's a magic time Paul it's a magic time what do you think of
[03:09:55.800 --> 03:09:59.920]  this Brandon Strock idea of a nationwide March and and movements
[03:09:59.920 --> 03:10:04.000]  everywhere of people that don't want to kill each other people that don't hate
[03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:06.920]  each other from the left and right coming together not even walking away
[03:10:06.920 --> 03:10:09.720]  from the Democrats I say that too but walking away from the hate and walking
[03:10:09.720 --> 03:10:13.640]  away from any Democratic rally they always tell you they always tell the
[03:10:13.640 --> 03:10:17.200]  Democrats don't talk to Alex or don't talk to anybody don't talk to Fox News
[03:10:17.200 --> 03:10:21.800]  don't talk to it's a cult no we're gonna talk walk away from the cult that
[03:10:21.800 --> 03:10:26.800]  tells you don't talk Paul how big is this I mean in a gut level it's big
[03:10:26.800 --> 03:10:30.800]  because they no longer have an argument Alex the reason they say don't talk to
[03:10:30.800 --> 03:10:35.280]  people is because that muscle has become so flaccid that argument muscle that
[03:10:35.280 --> 03:10:41.320]  they don't have one so to even engage in a conversation is means automatic defeat
[03:10:41.320 --> 03:10:44.760]  to them because they've got no argument whatsoever in fact I don't know if you've
[03:10:44.760 --> 03:10:47.760]  seen the video I wrote an article about this about a couple of hours ago it's
[03:10:47.760 --> 03:10:52.200]  up on him for Wars.com it's literally a guy outside the Supreme Court with a
[03:10:52.200 --> 03:10:56.360]  bullhorn reading out constitutional passages and they're just screaming in
[03:10:56.360 --> 03:11:00.280]  his face it's like scream helplessly at the sky but they're doing it in this guy's
[03:11:00.280 --> 03:11:05.040]  face and it's literally all they've got what's the name of the article everybody
[03:11:05.040 --> 03:11:08.200]  needs to get this viral info wars.com what's the name of the viral for the
[03:11:08.200 --> 03:11:12.760]  article oh just 300 show up for protest against Trump's Supreme Court it's not
[03:11:12.760 --> 03:11:18.600]  that one it's the later one I'll find it I'll find it we'll go back to a minute
[03:11:18.600 --> 03:11:23.440]  liberals triggered into literal screaming fit by man reading Constitution it's
[03:11:23.440 --> 03:11:30.920]  up on him for Wars.com right now. So yeah basically the only criticism you get
[03:11:30.920 --> 03:11:35.040]  for that walk away movement is oh but you're playing identity politics
[03:11:35.040 --> 03:11:39.560]  Alex well no way we're using identity politics in some senses to unite people
[03:11:39.560 --> 03:11:44.240]  they only ever use them to divide people so that's where people can actually
[03:11:44.240 --> 03:11:48.320]  come together and have an impact and when all you've literally got is having a
[03:11:48.320 --> 03:11:53.560]  screaming hissy fit in someone's face as a means of conversation that's not gonna
[03:11:53.560 --> 03:11:58.200]  resonate very well with any right thinking person is it so at this point
[03:11:58.200 --> 03:12:01.920]  my way ahead of the game Alex. We'll have that audio and video you're taking over
[03:12:01.920 --> 03:12:04.400]  right now you got a big guest coming on I should have mentioned that thanks for
[03:12:04.400 --> 03:12:07.440]  letting me hijack it but I always love talking to you here on air Paul but
[03:12:07.440 --> 03:12:11.720]  but but exactly we're saying to Democrats that are disillusioned by the
[03:12:11.720 --> 03:12:16.240]  hating America rhetoric all the race baiting all the Russian bot crap who are
[03:12:16.240 --> 03:12:20.880]  sick of Hillary getting ready to run again just come out and meet us like a
[03:12:20.880 --> 03:12:25.360]  neighborhood you know party or something and and everybody that wants to
[03:12:25.360 --> 03:12:28.080]  fight with each other over there everybody that wants to come together
[03:12:28.080 --> 03:12:33.400]  and hug come over here the witchy leaks all of it is about division and we're
[03:12:33.400 --> 03:12:37.160]  about unity just saying we're all allowed to have freedom of speech I think
[03:12:37.160 --> 03:12:40.640]  this just like you said hashtag walk away was genius it's so simple don't do
[03:12:40.640 --> 03:12:44.560]  anything violent whatever walk away and then walk away and find normal people
[03:12:44.560 --> 03:12:49.360]  and come together I'm telling you we have just discovered the next level I
[03:12:49.360 --> 03:12:55.160]  know it we've I'm telling we got all of us I could tell that guy's totally for
[03:12:55.160 --> 03:13:00.520]  real you just we've got a fully get behind this Paul yeah then we see
[03:13:00.520 --> 03:13:03.280]  similar things happening in the UK you've probably heard about this Trump
[03:13:03.280 --> 03:13:06.880]  baby balloon that's gonna be flowing over houses of parliament when Trump
[03:13:06.880 --> 03:13:09.880]  visits on Friday he's not gonna visit London look they're gonna do it anyway
[03:13:09.880 --> 03:13:14.640]  okay so it took them it took them about a month with sustained mainstream media
[03:13:14.640 --> 03:13:20.080]  coverage a month to raise about 30,000 pounds which is about 40,000 dollars to
[03:13:20.080 --> 03:13:25.120]  pay for that Trump balloon somebody did an oppositional response to that a
[03:13:25.120 --> 03:13:31.480]  Sadiq Khan baby balloon it took them three days to launch a greater amount of
[03:13:31.480 --> 03:13:36.680]  money with zero press attention whatsoever virtually zero so your guests
[03:13:36.680 --> 03:13:40.320]  was talking about you know conservatism as a new counterculture they can no
[03:13:40.320 --> 03:13:44.480]  longer claim to be anti-establishment in fact when you dig into this the people
[03:13:44.480 --> 03:13:49.560]  behind the Trump baby balloon they're very wealthy they own like two million
[03:13:49.560 --> 03:13:55.200]  the guy who paid for it owns two million townhouses in London he's from a
[03:13:55.200 --> 03:14:00.440]  wealthy political million that townhouses no I mean two million pounds but
[03:14:00.440 --> 03:14:04.880]  he's from a wealthy political family it's claiming that it's anti-establishment
[03:14:04.880 --> 03:14:09.680]  okay you're not anti-establishment you're upper middle class you've got a
[03:14:09.680 --> 03:14:14.120]  smorgasbord of mainstream media attention to get this fun and all you
[03:14:14.120 --> 03:14:19.560]  can raise 30,000 pounds for $50,000 my only question is why is the Sadiq Khan
[03:14:19.560 --> 03:14:24.840]  baby balloon why are his diapers not full of crap we need brown diapers on
[03:14:24.840 --> 03:14:29.720]  that piece of crap or you could make it into a kind of pig which in fact that
[03:14:29.720 --> 03:14:36.080]  has been suggested by the organ oh he's an Islamist a pig in diapers a pig with
[03:14:36.080 --> 03:14:40.240]  his head on it actually Piers Morgan who suggested that because it was Sadiq
[03:14:40.240 --> 03:14:46.040]  Khan that approved the Trump baby blimp I mean he's not busy enough with all the
[03:14:46.040 --> 03:14:49.360]  violent crime happening in London he had time to approve that though so is he
[03:14:49.360 --> 03:14:54.480]  gonna approve himself as a baby a pig baby and is that gonna be flown over
[03:14:54.480 --> 03:14:57.840]  London because they've already got it funded they're just waiting on approval
[03:14:57.840 --> 03:15:01.560]  and that is the guest who I'm gonna be talking to later today on the show and
[03:15:01.560 --> 03:15:08.080]  let's not forget that baby is kicking their butt up and down the street well
[03:15:08.080 --> 03:15:12.960]  it will be yeah but we've got a Trump visit this weekend Friday you know we've
[03:15:12.960 --> 03:15:17.000]  had visits from Erdogan the Islamist dictator of Turkey the crown prince of
[03:15:17.000 --> 03:15:21.760]  Saudi Arabia they torture people they put gay people in camps they're basically
[03:15:21.760 --> 03:15:25.600]  walk room and all's what they're doing in Yemen no protest against that but
[03:15:25.600 --> 03:15:29.720]  Donald Trump comes the leader of the free world and they all spit out their

[03:18:00.360 --> 03:18:04.680]  estates but a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rain water and we need to
[03:18:04.680 --> 03:18:09.840]  be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal
[03:18:09.840 --> 03:18:15.080]  particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to
[03:18:15.080 --> 03:18:21.600]  find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what
[03:18:21.600 --> 03:18:25.120]  we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and
[03:18:25.120 --> 03:18:30.160]  acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity
[03:18:30.160 --> 03:18:35.320]  filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the pH
[03:18:35.320 --> 03:18:40.920]  was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the Alexa
[03:18:40.920 --> 03:18:45.760]  pure raises the pH of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and
[03:18:45.760 --> 03:18:50.840]  acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more importantly a good
[03:18:50.840 --> 03:18:57.120]  water filtration system will purify it Alex Jones here with an extremely

[03:20:20.120 --> 03:20:28.440]  and now your host Paul Joseph Watson we'll have this fourth hour of the Alex
[03:20:28.440 --> 03:20:33.920]  Jones show on this July 10th edition 2018 in the next segment we're gonna talk
[03:20:33.920 --> 03:20:38.960]  to our guest who is Yanni Brewer he is the man behind the Sadiq Karn baby
[03:20:38.960 --> 03:20:43.720]  balloon which is a counter protest in essence to the Donald Trump baby balloon
[03:20:43.720 --> 03:20:47.800]  that's gonna be flown over the houses of parliament or at least nearby on
[03:20:47.800 --> 03:20:52.360]  Friday when Trump visits the United Kingdom he's not going to be visiting
[03:20:52.360 --> 03:20:57.640]  London at all because basically a cowardly conservative in name only
[03:20:57.640 --> 03:21:01.760]  government would not extend the invitation of a state visit to Donald
[03:21:01.760 --> 03:21:05.520]  Trump it's only gonna be a working visit so he's not even gonna get anywhere
[03:21:05.520 --> 03:21:10.600]  near London basically because they're so petrified God forbid that protesters
[03:21:10.600 --> 03:21:15.920]  might emerge again a damning indictment of the cowardice the sheer unparalleled
[03:21:15.920 --> 03:21:20.120]  cowardice of our conservative in name only government there's basically just
[03:21:20.120 --> 03:21:25.120]  betrayed Brexit full-scale now and finally at least they're being honest
[03:21:25.120 --> 03:21:28.680]  about the fact and we can move forward from that position but we're gonna talk
[03:21:28.680 --> 03:21:33.320]  about the Trump balloon the Sadiq Karn balloon later on let's talk first about
[03:21:33.320 --> 03:21:38.800]  YouTube which has basically introduced a new guidelines or new algorithm
[03:21:38.800 --> 03:21:43.480]  changes once again without notifying that they're subscriber base without
[03:21:43.480 --> 03:21:46.600]  notifying their biggest creators obviously they do that every single time
[03:21:46.600 --> 03:21:51.200]  headline out of wired news YouTube debuts plan to promote and fund
[03:21:51.200 --> 03:21:57.200]  authoritative news what GI wonder what this is gonna be all about following a
[03:21:57.200 --> 03:22:01.720]  year in which YouTube has repeatedly promote a conspiracy theory videos it
[03:22:01.720 --> 03:22:05.040]  didn't promote them they just happen to pop up during breaking news events like
[03:22:05.040 --> 03:22:08.280]  the shootings in Parkland the company now announced Monday a slew of new
[03:22:08.280 --> 03:22:11.320]  features it helps will make news on the platform more reliable and less
[03:22:11.320 --> 03:22:16.280]  susceptible to manipulation the company is also investing 25 million dollars in
[03:22:16.280 --> 03:22:20.320]  grants to news organizations looking to expand their video operations now this
[03:22:20.320 --> 03:22:24.480]  is the key point according to YouTube executives the goal is to identify
[03:22:24.480 --> 03:22:28.920]  authoritative news sources bring those videos to the top of users feeds and
[03:22:28.920 --> 03:22:35.040]  support quality journalism so in other words all these news organizations who
[03:22:35.040 --> 03:22:39.640]  exist on YouTube a totally crap at it they don't know what the hell they're
[03:22:39.640 --> 03:22:45.280]  doing they need the system to be gained they need a helping hand simply to
[03:22:45.280 --> 03:22:49.920]  compete with the people on YouTube who do know what they're doing that's what
[03:22:49.920 --> 03:22:54.080]  it's all about you go and look at some of these news organizations the likes of
[03:22:54.080 --> 03:22:59.360]  CNN I mean combined my own channel Alex Jones channel got more subscribers than
[03:22:59.360 --> 03:23:04.400]  CNN or at least it did on last check most of their videos don't go viral you
[03:23:04.400 --> 03:23:09.840]  look at YouTube platform YouTube content creators like MSNBC mainstream news
[03:23:09.840 --> 03:23:14.480]  organizations NBC CBS they're terrible they don't know what they're doing they
[03:23:14.480 --> 03:23:18.200]  don't know how to have viral videos they're not solely focused on it so now
[03:23:18.200 --> 03:23:22.720]  they're going to be given a handout basically not like that you know giant
[03:23:22.720 --> 03:23:26.960]  monopoly conglomerate organizations already was huge swaths of money coming
[03:23:26.960 --> 03:23:31.640]  in they're going to be given huge amounts of money by Google to compete with
[03:23:31.640 --> 03:23:36.160]  other people on YouTube and that's not enough no they need to change the
[03:23:36.160 --> 03:23:41.040]  algorithm to rank all these legacy media news outlets above everyone else
[03:23:41.040 --> 03:23:45.400]  because even with millions and millions of dollars flooding into their coffers
[03:23:45.400 --> 03:23:50.120]  that still is not enough to help them compete because they're so utterly
[03:23:50.120 --> 03:23:55.640]  useless anodyne pouring nobody wants to watch them so they need the system to
[03:23:55.640 --> 03:24:01.160]  be gained this is what I've been warning about but over a year now the fact
[03:24:01.160 --> 03:24:04.960]  they were all slaves to the algorithm in fact you can look at the search engine
[03:24:04.960 --> 03:24:08.800]  obviously YouTube is owned by Google look at the search engine as well I mean I
[03:24:08.800 --> 03:24:13.480]  can search for headlines they're almost verbatim what I wrote on info wars.com
[03:24:13.480 --> 03:24:19.200]  or the key terms of an article I wrote for info wars.com about anything mainly
[03:24:19.200 --> 03:24:23.960]  about the migrant crisis and things like that the top 10 the top 20 links on the
[03:24:23.960 --> 03:24:29.640]  first page snopes.com Washington Post all these ridiculous fact-checker
[03:24:29.640 --> 03:24:33.520]  websites that have proven to be completely partisan completely biased time
[03:24:33.520 --> 03:24:39.480]  and time again even when you put in key terms for an article it ignores those
[03:24:39.480 --> 03:24:44.460]  terms and simply throws up negative information for example about Alex
[03:24:44.460 --> 03:24:48.280]  Jones no Alex Jones has caught he searched for stuff about the migrant
[03:24:48.280 --> 03:24:52.880]  crisis articles I wrote a year ago two years ago it comes up with Alex Jones's
[03:24:52.880 --> 03:24:57.760]  court case there's nothing whatsoever to do with it because they've artificially
[03:24:57.760 --> 03:25:02.800]  gamed the algorithm to promote negative information about info wars.com about
[03:25:02.800 --> 03:25:07.120]  Alex Jones and put it above above the information that you're actually
[03:25:07.120 --> 03:25:13.880]  searching for so that that intent on by on burying information on manipulating
[03:25:13.880 --> 03:25:17.800]  people we've had studies which we featured before where they can shift
[03:25:17.800 --> 03:25:22.240]  millions and millions of votes on the day of an election simply by placing one
[03:25:22.240 --> 03:25:27.720]  candidate above above another in a Google search result they can shift
[03:25:27.720 --> 03:25:32.080]  millions of votes they've proven it in India in all these different countries so
[03:25:32.080 --> 03:25:35.360]  it doesn't matter how much reach you have really if they control the algorithm
[03:25:35.360 --> 03:25:40.200]  then we're in trouble that's why you know that that's now finally starting about
[03:25:40.200 --> 03:25:44.000]  some kind of government regulation basically Google search ranking
[03:25:44.000 --> 03:25:48.320]  manipulation is affecting elections they did a giant study into this in India and
[03:25:48.320 --> 03:25:52.360]  a couple of other countries and again depending on the platforms how they
[03:25:52.360 --> 03:25:56.120]  were how they were presented in a negative or positive light and the
[03:25:56.120 --> 03:26:00.160]  search results in order they could shift millions and millions of votes now
[03:26:00.160 --> 03:26:04.160]  they're doing the same on YouTube and talking about in fact they mention us
[03:26:04.160 --> 03:26:08.440]  they get into it in this article that's one reason why known propagandists
[03:26:08.440 --> 03:26:12.840]  they're talking about the the algorithm spreading falsehoods is one reason why
[03:26:12.840 --> 03:26:16.120]  known propagandists like Alex Jones of info wars have managed to build wildly
[03:26:16.120 --> 03:26:19.480]  successful channels on the back of conspiracy theories so again it's this
[03:26:19.480 --> 03:26:24.120]  it's this attitude that they need to protect you from conspiracy theories
[03:26:24.120 --> 03:26:28.760]  God forbid and in fact in this article they talk about things like the Bermuda
[03:26:28.760 --> 03:26:33.800]  triangle it's not even political you can't even have people making fun
[03:26:33.800 --> 03:26:39.200]  conspiracy videos about the Bermuda triangle without them slapping a fact
[03:26:39.200 --> 03:26:44.320]  check on it like who even cares like slapping a fact check on big four or
[03:26:44.320 --> 03:26:49.080]  something like that UFOs it's not even political and they say no we're even
[03:26:49.080 --> 03:26:55.560]  gonna relegate that content how dare you even talk about it so again it's this
[03:26:55.560 --> 03:27:00.960]  nannying idea that you have to be protected from conspiracy theory videos
[03:27:00.960 --> 03:27:06.800]  on YouTube no some people want to watch that so if they want to search for it
[03:27:06.800 --> 03:27:11.200]  they want to watch it that's what should come on most of these conspiracy videos
[03:27:11.200 --> 03:27:14.560]  annoy the hell out of me too you know everything's a false flag everything
[03:27:14.560 --> 03:27:19.480]  staged but if people want to watch that they should be allowed to watch it
[03:27:19.480 --> 03:27:24.040]  without you nannying them and saying no you can't have that so we're literally
[03:27:24.040 --> 03:27:29.800]  gonna change the algorithm and bury you beneath 20 stupid CNN videos which
[03:27:29.800 --> 03:27:33.480]  aren't even related to the subject that you're searching about it's absolutely
[03:27:33.480 --> 03:27:37.920]  ridiculous but it shows how desperate they are in trying to come back and
[03:27:37.920 --> 03:27:42.920]  trying to compete with people who literally spend 10 15 years of their
[03:27:42.920 --> 03:27:47.720]  lives at this point building a YouTube career building a YouTube personality
[03:27:47.720 --> 03:27:53.000]  building the infrastructure of actual independent news organizations I'm not
[03:27:53.000 --> 03:27:55.600]  even talking about in four walls I'm talking about you know people like
[03:27:55.600 --> 03:27:59.960]  Philip DeFranco he's essentially his own independent news organization those are
[03:27:59.960 --> 03:28:03.360]  the people that are gonna get punished by it and it's because they can't compete
[03:28:03.360 --> 03:28:08.960]  it's because to be successful on YouTube you need to have a personality okay
[03:28:08.960 --> 03:28:12.480]  but most people who work for the mainstream media do not have a
[03:28:12.480 --> 03:28:18.240]  personality and it takes years and years to build a loyal audience that will
[03:28:18.240 --> 03:28:21.800]  want to watch every single one of your videos that's how you build up an
[03:28:21.800 --> 03:28:26.240]  audience that's how you go viral that's how you build up a huge subscriber base
[03:28:26.240 --> 03:28:31.360]  mainstream media has no idea how to achieve that so now YouTube Google has
[03:28:31.360 --> 03:28:35.040]  said oh we'll just give you 25 million dollars each we'll just boost you up
[03:28:35.040 --> 03:28:40.240]  artificially we'll break the system and now will you be able to compete even
[03:28:40.240 --> 03:28:44.040]  after this they probably will still fail because they're so utterly useless and
[03:28:44.040 --> 03:28:46.720]  they don't know what they're doing when it comes to YouTube and they're just
[03:28:46.720 --> 03:28:50.280]  gonna try and stand for everybody else we'll do by on the arts show show live

[03:33:24.560 --> 03:33:28.760]  into this issue of the Sadiq Khan baby balloon of course the big news headlines
[03:33:28.760 --> 03:33:33.520]  this week we're all about the donald trump baby balloon and in fact I'm
[03:33:33.520 --> 03:33:38.240]  reading a headline here from spiked magazine who's the real baby here it
[03:33:38.240 --> 03:33:43.000]  gets into who's behind this donald trump baby balloon it's a 24 baby balloon of
[03:33:43.000 --> 03:33:47.080]  donald trump in a nappy which they plan to fight fly near the houses of
[03:33:47.080 --> 03:33:51.040]  parliament when trump visits this week despite the fact that donald trump isn't
[03:33:51.040 --> 03:33:54.840]  going anywhere near london because our conservative and name-only government is
[03:33:54.840 --> 03:33:59.960]  so afraid of the protesters who might show up so basically they've got this
[03:33:59.960 --> 03:34:03.840]  20-foot balloon ready to fly near the houses of parliament this is what it
[03:34:03.840 --> 03:34:08.440]  says about it in the spiked magazine article who's the real baby here the
[03:34:08.440 --> 03:34:12.800]  anti-trump stunt has been organized by environmental activist leo murray the
[03:34:12.800 --> 03:34:17.720]  great grandson of labor politician anthony greenwood murray who rents out
[03:34:17.720 --> 03:34:22.520]  two flats in a 1.8 million pound townhouse in hammersmith has written a
[03:34:22.520 --> 03:34:26.920]  piece for the guardian explaining his reasons well of course he has and
[03:34:26.920 --> 03:34:30.920]  basically it goes on to say that on the morning trump was elected this guy
[03:34:30.920 --> 03:34:35.920]  cried oh boo hoo he cried his eyes out now he's gonna get his revenge by
[03:34:35.920 --> 03:34:41.240]  launching this trump balloon near the houses of parliament goes on to basically
[03:34:41.240 --> 03:34:45.920]  say that they are justifying this they're saying that the motive behind
[03:34:45.920 --> 03:34:50.680]  this is because they're fighting back against the establishment so a project
[03:34:50.680 --> 03:34:56.400]  initiated by a super rich member of a political family in london that lives in
[03:34:56.400 --> 03:35:01.640]  a cushy townhouse in hammersmith two million pounds a project approved by the
[03:35:01.640 --> 03:35:06.320]  mayor of london that's anti-establishment is it no it isn't that's
[03:35:06.320 --> 03:35:13.560]  ridiculous it's another corbinista upper middle-class bourgeoisie pretending to
[03:35:13.560 --> 03:35:17.720]  be anti-establishment pretending to be working class when they're not this is
[03:35:17.720 --> 03:35:22.360]  what we see over and over again and now we have on the line yanny brouwer who is
[03:35:22.360 --> 03:35:27.040]  the man behind the response to this which is the sedique corn baby balloon
[03:35:27.040 --> 03:35:32.240]  which he intends to fly at some point over london over the next few weeks it
[03:35:32.240 --> 03:35:38.240]  raised over 50,000 dollars now over 40,000 pounds in basically less than a
[03:35:38.240 --> 03:35:42.840]  week and as I said earlier they raised more money in significantly less time
[03:35:42.840 --> 03:35:48.200]  than the trump baby balloon with virtually zero media coverage an
[03:35:48.200 --> 03:35:51.880]  absolutely fantastic effort they beat them they're still not getting the
[03:35:51.880 --> 03:35:55.320]  recognition they deserve but yanny brouwer welcome to the show
[03:35:55.320 --> 03:35:59.840]  cool thanks for having me Paul now first I just want to ask you about what
[03:35:59.840 --> 03:36:04.240]  inspired you to start this project and going beyond just flying the balloon
[03:36:04.240 --> 03:36:11.200]  what's the ultimate plan for this project yes I mean in the project I'm the
[03:36:11.200 --> 03:36:15.160]  reason for doing this I mean was I was really annoyed at Khan's willingness to
[03:36:15.160 --> 03:36:18.560]  to insult the most powerful man in the Western world Donald Trump you know as
[03:36:18.560 --> 03:36:22.640]  a friend of Britain is half British himself and we need those kind of
[03:36:22.640 --> 03:36:27.000]  friends after Brexit so I was really irritated by it and the fact that city
[03:36:27.000 --> 03:36:30.960]  can't think that you can say that don't Trump isn't welcome or the president of
[03:36:30.960 --> 03:36:35.800]  the United States a great ally of ours isn't welcome to London or to the UK on
[03:36:35.800 --> 03:36:39.600]  our behalf when he's not elected to represent us it's it's really
[03:36:39.600 --> 03:36:43.040]  frustrating and irritating so I wanted to address that the serious issue of free
[03:36:43.040 --> 03:36:46.440]  speech as well and in a light-hearted way and I thought the best way to do that
[03:36:46.440 --> 03:36:51.240]  would be a tip-for-tap move and see if city Khan is willing to have a giant
[03:36:51.240 --> 03:36:57.440]  blimp of himself caricature of himself and commit his own insulting mockery in
[03:36:57.440 --> 03:37:03.480]  the name of free speech and moving now I'm sorry yeah go ahead no I was gonna say
[03:37:03.480 --> 03:37:06.920]  and and beyond this you know I think everyone's had enough of city kind in
[03:37:06.920 --> 03:37:12.880]  terms of the crime and him try to talk on our behalf and like I said what's the
[03:37:12.880 --> 03:37:16.200]  bigger reason behind it the bigger reason is to try and remove Khan's office is
[03:37:16.200 --> 03:37:20.320]  clearly not fit to be mayor we've seen that with the soaring crime rates in
[03:37:20.320 --> 03:37:25.200]  in London and his failure and unwillingness to address those serious
[03:37:25.200 --> 03:37:31.200]  issues so correct me if I'm wrong but do you plan to have some kind of event I
[03:37:31.200 --> 03:37:34.160]  don't know how much you want to get into this but you plan on having some kind of
[03:37:34.160 --> 03:37:37.600]  event which draws attention to the massive violent crime problems we've
[03:37:37.600 --> 03:37:41.600]  been having in London is that correct yes the idea is to synchronize the
[03:37:41.600 --> 03:37:46.840]  baby Khan balloon blimp and have it airborne at this event the event will
[03:37:46.840 --> 03:37:51.520]  be make London great make London safe again sorry and be some time in August
[03:37:51.520 --> 03:37:55.800]  we're kind of working on the exact details of it but it'll be some time in
[03:37:55.800 --> 03:37:59.280]  August and with the aim of trying to make London safe again and of course you
[03:37:59.280 --> 03:38:04.880]  know London can't be safe with city Khan's man now let's talk about the
[03:38:04.880 --> 03:38:08.520]  media attention because as I mentioned earlier you made more money in less time
[03:38:08.520 --> 03:38:13.200]  than the Trump baby balloon despite the fact that they basically had a week or
[03:38:13.200 --> 03:38:17.600]  more of sustained intense media coverage how interested has the mainstream
[03:38:17.600 --> 03:38:24.360]  media been in your project yes we went live on Thursday today Tuesday so five
[03:38:24.360 --> 03:38:28.960]  days we've made 40,000 I think the Trump balloon has made about 27,000 in over a
[03:38:28.960 --> 03:38:34.120]  month so it has been quite astonishing really the mainstream media after
[03:38:34.120 --> 03:38:38.000]  yourself you got involved and I had a couple of messages from from a few
[03:38:38.000 --> 03:38:41.400]  people and yesterday and today it's picked up a little bit I'm on the
[03:38:41.400 --> 03:38:47.840]  Victoria Derbyshire show tomorrow BBC son of contacted me I think I the eye
[03:38:47.840 --> 03:38:51.720]  newspaper in the UK have done a piece but it's obviously nowhere near as much
[03:38:51.720 --> 03:38:58.600]  as the baby Trump balloon so it was only after you start baking serious money and
[03:38:58.600 --> 03:39:01.800]  getting this funded that they actually had to pay attention to it you've got
[03:39:01.800 --> 03:39:05.840]  more money in three days than they got in 30 days absolutely monumental effort
[03:39:05.840 --> 03:39:10.520]  but you know with this Trump visit we've had I've spoken to people people in
[03:39:10.520 --> 03:39:14.600]  UKIP and others who've said you know they've tried to have Trump welcoming
[03:39:14.600 --> 03:39:19.520]  street parties or celebrations not even protests they're being told no by the
[03:39:19.520 --> 03:39:23.920]  police obviously the police have authorised these giant protests to take
[03:39:23.920 --> 03:39:29.040]  place on Friday Karn Sadiq Karn has authorized that the blimp to go up on
[03:39:29.040 --> 03:39:33.360]  Friday what do you what do you have approved a giant inflatable black
[03:39:33.360 --> 03:39:38.760]  Barack Obama baby blimp flying over Poland this is a question and do has he
[03:39:38.760 --> 03:39:43.080]  already approved your balloon or is that still in the works that's doing the
[03:39:43.080 --> 03:39:47.720]  works and no of course you would have approved a baby Obama would he just
[03:39:47.720 --> 03:39:52.160]  wouldn't have happened and I saw that today he was on the is it a great
[03:39:52.160 --> 03:39:55.400]  morning Britain show or something with Pierce Morgan and Pierce Morgan asked
[03:39:55.400 --> 03:40:00.880]  him he said you know if the if someone makes a baby blimp of you or you as a
[03:40:00.880 --> 03:40:04.640]  pig caricature and would you be willing to fly and he said if it's a safe and
[03:40:04.640 --> 03:40:08.640]  peaceful demonstration then yes so based on that you know I don't see any
[03:40:08.640 --> 03:40:12.360]  reason why it won't go ahead and I think it's kind of pigeonholed himself a
[03:40:12.360 --> 03:40:17.320]  little bit and in terms of his maneuvers now so he's basically backed
[03:40:17.320 --> 03:40:20.760]  himself into a corner what exactly is this blimp gonna look like is it just
[03:40:20.760 --> 03:40:24.640]  gonna be Sadiq in a in a nappy or you're gonna incorporate some kind of pig
[03:40:24.640 --> 03:40:28.560]  design into it now that they've mentioned that it's currently with an
[03:40:28.560 --> 03:40:32.480]  illustration artist and illustrator so we're gonna work on a couple of
[03:40:32.480 --> 03:40:35.560]  different designs see what's best but you know it's got to capture the horrible
[03:40:35.560 --> 03:40:40.080]  features of Sadiq you know the horrible hook nose the bags under the eyes and it's
[03:40:40.080 --> 03:40:45.160]  gonna be pretty gruesome we'll see how triggered he gets because that was my
[03:40:45.160 --> 03:40:48.400]  response when I first read about the Trump balloon you know a lot of people
[03:40:48.400 --> 03:40:52.520]  on the right said oh this is a disgrace this is insulting the president
[03:40:52.520 --> 03:40:55.800]  which it is but that's kind of not the reaction you have because then you get
[03:40:55.800 --> 03:40:59.480]  called a snowflake they say you're triggered obviously that they're too
[03:40:59.480 --> 03:41:02.560]  dim-witted to think up their own insults so they just use our insults
[03:41:02.560 --> 03:41:07.480]  against us but your response is exactly right you take that and you turn it back
[03:41:07.480 --> 03:41:11.080]  on them then you make him look like an absolute hypocrite if he doesn't
[03:41:11.080 --> 03:41:14.800]  authorize this so I guess I'm guessing that was your response so the response
[03:41:14.800 --> 03:41:19.000]  wasn't to get offended by the Trump baby blue it was to respond in the way you
[03:41:19.000 --> 03:41:23.800]  did which was to use the exact same stunt against them right exactly yes I
[03:41:23.800 --> 03:41:28.120]  thought okay if you want to play that game you know to play that game but
[03:41:28.120 --> 03:41:33.600]  this time you're gonna have to prove yourself in having a big massive 30-foot
[03:41:33.600 --> 03:41:37.000]  blimp of yourself flying over London and we'll see how nice that is see if
[03:41:37.000 --> 03:41:40.520]  you're willing to submit yourself to the same public humiliation you are so
[03:41:40.520 --> 03:41:45.760]  easily to Donald Trump now we're gonna come back after the break and talk more
[03:41:45.760 --> 03:41:49.680]  about this talk about that the sheer hypocrisy and Khan having nothing to
[03:41:49.680 --> 03:41:52.960]  say about you know the crown prince of Saudi Arabia visiting the Islamist
[03:41:52.960 --> 03:41:57.760]  dictator Erdogan just want to read some stats though about London crime
[03:41:57.760 --> 03:42:03.360]  under Sadiq Khan since he came to power as mayor knife attacks of sword by 21%
[03:42:03.360 --> 03:42:09.520]  shooting incidents by 23% street robberies by 33% motorbike robberies by
[03:42:09.520 --> 03:42:16.280]  50% and murders by 40% in February and March London had more murders it
[03:42:16.280 --> 03:42:20.480]  exceeded the murder rate of New York this is a giant problem his previous
[03:42:20.480 --> 03:42:24.400]  excuse was to say oh but we did a report about that last month and basically
[03:42:24.400 --> 03:42:28.920]  it's getting worse and worse and worse the police are being given fewer and
[03:42:28.920 --> 03:42:32.800]  fewer powers to actually chase these moped criminals for example they're
[03:42:32.800 --> 03:42:35.960]  trying to turn it around right now simply because of the massive public
[03:42:35.960 --> 03:42:39.320]  backlash but again these these figures seem to be getting worse and worse
[03:42:39.320 --> 03:42:43.080]  that's what you're gonna be drawing attention to with these this city Khan
[03:42:43.080 --> 03:42:46.880]  baby balloon and it's gonna be very intriguing how they're response to it
[03:42:46.880 --> 03:42:51.280]  but we're gonna talk about it more after the break on the Alex Jones show live

[03:47:29.120 --> 03:47:34.160]  about the trump baby bloom which is set to fly over london this friday now just
[03:47:34.160 --> 03:47:37.560]  looking at some of the recent visitors to london let's take a look at this
[03:47:37.560 --> 03:47:43.040]  shortlist crown prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin salman this is a guy who's
[03:47:43.040 --> 03:47:47.280]  presiding over war crimes in Yemen he's presiding over the persecution of gays
[03:47:47.280 --> 03:47:53.040]  and women in Saudi Arabia who protested his visit to london barely anybody let's
[03:47:53.040 --> 03:47:57.800]  look at the islamist dictator president Erdogan of turkey you know a guy who locks
[03:47:57.800 --> 03:48:02.360]  up journalists a guy who tortures people a guy who has his own goons beat people
[03:48:02.360 --> 03:48:08.120]  up in the united states who protested his visit barely anybody let's look at what's
[03:48:08.120 --> 03:48:11.880]  happening in Iran women are literally being tortured and imprisoned for
[03:48:11.880 --> 03:48:16.240]  removing their hijabs there was another famous case of that that happened this
[03:48:16.240 --> 03:48:20.520]  week where are the feminists where are the marchers on the iranian embassies
[03:48:20.520 --> 03:48:25.960]  they're not happening sudic corn said nothing about any of that nobody really
[03:48:25.960 --> 03:48:32.360]  protested it oh but donald trump donald trump said grab them by the pussy 13
[03:48:32.360 --> 03:48:37.960]  years ago and we're expecting 100,000 people out on the streets absolutely
[03:48:37.960 --> 03:48:43.440]  absurd the level to which people allow themselves to be manipulated by fake
[03:48:43.440 --> 03:48:47.920]  moral outrage fake hysteria you know yanny how many of these people are
[03:48:47.920 --> 03:48:52.320]  going to be out protesting this weekend because they feel a genuine moral urge to
[03:48:52.320 --> 03:48:56.200]  do so and how many of them are going to be doing it you know for an instagram
[03:48:56.200 --> 03:49:02.160]  selfie because they're vapid virtue signaling morons yeah I mean I think with
[03:49:02.160 --> 03:49:05.000]  anti-trump thing I think people are anti-trump to be anti-trump on it I
[03:49:05.000 --> 03:49:08.080]  don't think there's any there's no real substance to any of it otherwise they'd
[03:49:08.080 --> 03:49:12.520]  be out there you know campaign against like the people he just mentioned so a
[03:49:12.520 --> 03:49:16.920]  lot of it is to do with popularity it's really popular it's really cool to be
[03:49:16.920 --> 03:49:21.160]  anti-trump and if you're not anti-trump then you uncall and and basically you're
[03:49:21.160 --> 03:49:25.840]  silenced and you can't say that you're pro-trump or anything so a lot of it's
[03:49:25.840 --> 03:49:31.600]  just bullshit isn't it really it's exactly the word for it it's also
[03:49:31.600 --> 03:49:35.440]  there's no Glastonbury this year so they can't old shout for Jeremy Corbyn so
[03:49:35.440 --> 03:49:40.040]  they're probably missing that let me read you this quote from the Trump baby
[03:49:40.040 --> 03:49:45.040]  balloon activist your arch nemesis he said well what could have been a day of
[03:49:45.040 --> 03:49:49.480]  infamy for Britain he's talking about the visit of Trump instead becomes a day
[03:49:49.480 --> 03:49:54.320]  of national pride and unity so he thinks he's literally gonna create national
[03:49:54.320 --> 03:49:58.920]  pride and unity by flying this 20-foot Trump baby balloon
[03:49:58.920 --> 03:50:04.200]  Yanni how much unity do you think those people would exhibit in that crowd if you
[03:50:04.200 --> 03:50:09.640]  attended their protest wearing a red MAGA hat do you think they'd be very very
[03:50:09.640 --> 03:50:15.760]  forgiving and very unifying in that situation no I'm sure it'd be the same
[03:50:15.760 --> 03:50:19.360]  as being you know fed to a pack of wards if I was there wearing a make
[03:50:19.360 --> 03:50:24.680]  America great again so it's it's all kind of double standard isn't it it's
[03:50:24.680 --> 03:50:28.840]  completely double standards what they what they say they tolerate and and this
[03:50:28.840 --> 03:50:31.760]  kind of thing they don't it's the complete opposite it's actually the
[03:50:31.760 --> 03:50:35.880]  people on the who are more pro-trump on the right are the ones who are more
[03:50:35.880 --> 03:50:42.080]  tolerant it's incredible also now this is not to advocate any legal activity
[03:50:42.080 --> 03:50:45.680]  whatsoever we obviously don't do that but anybody who's been reading for channel
[03:50:45.680 --> 03:50:50.280]  the past few days knows that they've located where this Trump baby balloon is
[03:50:50.280 --> 03:50:55.440]  as with past 4chan events specifically with the child above and everything that
[03:50:55.440 --> 03:51:00.040]  happened with him they're talking about bringing this inflatable balloon down do
[03:51:00.040 --> 03:51:03.280]  you see that happening is usually you think that's on the horizon given how
[03:51:03.280 --> 03:51:08.800]  much chatter there is on 4chan about it I haven't seen the chatter on 4chan
[03:51:08.800 --> 03:51:13.640]  personally but it you know it would be good to see if it did come down it'd be
[03:51:13.640 --> 03:51:19.360]  nice to see I'm not you know like I said advocating that but I think there's I
[03:51:19.360 --> 03:51:24.240]  think people underestimate just how irritating at this event is just how
[03:51:24.240 --> 03:51:28.080]  irritating this balloon is and people underestimate it and they think that
[03:51:28.080 --> 03:51:32.000]  everyone's anti-trump in the UK and it's not the case it's just not the case
[03:51:32.000 --> 03:51:37.840]  so you could want to come down you could see you know counter protest of some
[03:51:37.840 --> 03:51:42.920]  sort but these people are so blinded but you know these people in London these
[03:51:42.920 --> 03:51:47.680]  pro-trump anti-trump sorry they're so blinded by themselves they don't see
[03:51:47.680 --> 03:51:52.560]  anything else I don't see that there is actually support for Donald Trump in the
[03:51:52.560 --> 03:51:57.080]  UK yeah I mean it's really annoying when they claim to speak for everyone in the
[03:51:57.080 --> 03:52:00.640]  UK by being so intolerant of his visit while claiming that they're the
[03:52:00.640 --> 03:52:04.680]  tolerant ones I mean you had France France basically got a jump on us again
[03:52:04.680 --> 03:52:08.920]  the population of France I imagine are no great fans of Donald Trump in any in
[03:52:08.920 --> 03:52:13.280]  any large majority it's probably the same as in the UK but they got a jump on
[03:52:13.280 --> 03:52:17.320]  everyone they arranged a I think it was a state visit or the equivalent of before
[03:52:17.320 --> 03:52:22.200]  anyone else there were no giant protests obviously a few no giant protests it
[03:52:22.200 --> 03:52:25.720]  worked out well for both countries you know they could get over their little
[03:52:25.720 --> 03:52:29.160]  but hurt and just acknowledge the fact that even if you don't like the
[03:52:29.160 --> 03:52:33.280]  president you have to respect the office and to ostracize the president
[03:52:33.280 --> 03:52:37.760]  that's only going to harm our interests as he said when we need this Brexit deal
[03:52:37.760 --> 03:52:42.440]  if even you know Brexit happens at all at this point but just in closing
[03:52:42.440 --> 03:52:46.600]  Yanny tell people how they can support the funding and the organization of this
[03:52:46.600 --> 03:52:51.680]  Sadiq Khan baby balloon event yeah so it's there on crowdfunding we've got until
[03:52:51.680 --> 03:52:55.760]  the 9th of August so we've been going five days we've got 40,000 pounds and so
[03:52:55.760 --> 03:53:01.640]  it's a long way to go 9th of August for the funding so the bigger the donations
[03:53:01.640 --> 03:53:05.480]  the bigger the amount we raise the bigger the balloon the bigger the event the
[03:53:05.480 --> 03:53:09.360]  more we can do on the day to help make London safe again and if you want to get
[03:53:09.360 --> 03:53:14.760]  involved you can contact myself on Twitter or there'll be a few other
[03:53:14.760 --> 03:53:18.640]  details as well in the next coming days of who else to contact in regards to that
[03:53:18.640 --> 03:53:22.880]  but yeah keep the money coming in and then you know the more we raise the
[03:53:22.880 --> 03:53:26.680]  bigger this event can be and the more pressure we can put on Sadiq Khan
[03:53:26.680 --> 03:53:30.880]  definitely so people got a few weeks to keep that money rolling in you can stage
[03:53:30.880 --> 03:53:35.120]  a bigger and bigger event the more money you get and basically have a real
[03:53:35.120 --> 03:53:39.320]  response to these people who claim to represent those in the UK they don't
[03:53:39.320 --> 03:53:44.520]  you've proven that by out raising them in a matter of days it's a come a month
[03:53:44.520 --> 03:53:49.040]  to make what 27,000 pounds you made that in almost in just over three days
[03:53:49.040 --> 03:53:53.800]  absolutely monumental effort that the real the real fight back begins we will
[03:53:53.800 --> 03:53:57.920]  have our voice just as they have theirs and we'll continue to monitor it Yanni

[03:55:10.680 --> 03:55:15.920]  Trump visit this is a headline out of zero hedge Americans in UK urged to keep
[03:55:15.920 --> 03:55:20.880]  low profile during Trump visit so our conservative and name only government is
[03:55:20.880 --> 03:55:25.920]  so petrified of what might happen from these virtue signaling lefty
[03:55:25.920 --> 03:55:30.240]  Corbyn Easter middle-class idiots that all live in two million pound plush pads
[03:55:30.240 --> 03:55:34.920]  in West London that they're now telling Americans living in London or Americans
[03:55:34.920 --> 03:55:39.600]  visiting London to keep a low profile during President Trump's visit later
[03:55:39.600 --> 03:55:43.880]  this week following the NATO summit says numerous this is a warning this is the
[03:55:43.880 --> 03:55:48.240]  fish official warning from the US Embassy in London numerous demonstrations
[03:55:48.240 --> 03:55:52.120]  are being planned for July 12 to 14 surrounding the visit and visit of the
[03:55:52.120 --> 03:55:56.280]  president the United States Trump will hold talks with Theresa May and again
[03:55:56.280 --> 03:56:00.320]  he's not even going to be anywhere near London but they're telling Americans in
[03:56:00.320 --> 03:56:06.880]  London to be visible to keep a low profile because protest may turn violent
[03:56:06.880 --> 03:56:10.720]  they're literally telling people to keep a low profile just American tourists
[03:56:10.720 --> 03:56:15.360]  Americans living in London why would they need to do that is that they're
[03:56:15.360 --> 03:56:19.160]  telling them not to wear red MAGA hats is that it do we not want to trigger the
[03:56:19.160 --> 03:56:22.560]  tolerant liberals at this point is that what they're afraid of against
[03:56:22.560 --> 03:56:26.920]  absolute cowardly behavior from front to back with this government right now
[03:56:26.920 --> 03:56:31.840]  which is betrayed brexit and on that subject bright bar headline Trump backs
[03:56:31.840 --> 03:56:36.640]  Boris Johnson's brexit rebellion President Trump has bought petrol into
[03:56:36.640 --> 03:56:41.280]  the flames of UK Prime Minister Theresa May's brexit crisis by coming out for
[03:56:41.280 --> 03:56:46.160]  her chief opponent Boris Johnson so he gave these comments early today said
[03:56:46.160 --> 03:56:49.120]  Boris Johnson's a friend of mine he's been very very nice to me very supportive
[03:56:49.120 --> 03:56:54.800]  of course Trump sees his own legacy as being deeply embedded in the brexit
[03:56:54.800 --> 03:56:59.280]  vote which happened what about five months before he became president or at
[03:56:59.280 --> 03:57:04.560]  least was elected president so Trump sees his legacy in the legacy of brexit he
[03:57:04.560 --> 03:57:09.360]  wants to keep brexit alive brexit has been completely betrayed by our
[03:57:09.360 --> 03:57:13.600]  conservative and name only government over the past few days even with all
[03:57:13.600 --> 03:57:17.200]  these resignations it looks like Theresa May is going to keep her job the
[03:57:17.200 --> 03:57:22.120]  remainers in parliament are dancing a jig they're over the moon with this crappy
[03:57:22.120 --> 03:57:27.240]  deal which isn't brexit at all really we're facing dark times in the UK is the
