[00:00.000 --> 00:13.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:30.000 --> 00:59.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, April 22, 2021.
[00:59.000 --> 01:11.000]  I'm Alex Jones, coming to you live from deep in the heart of Texas, broadcasting worldwide, on what they call Earth Day, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11.000 --> 01:23.000]  But Earth Day is really United Nations' world government anti-human, post-carbon-based life form alien takeover day.
[01:23.000 --> 01:31.000]  And none of that is speculation. The globalists believe they're building a new creation. They believe they're invinely inspired to be gods.
[01:31.000 --> 01:39.000]  And they are overriding the very genetic code of the planet. They are manipulating the weather. They are attacking civilization.
[01:39.000 --> 01:46.000]  They are attacking the human species. They are overriding this planet.
[01:46.000 --> 01:55.000]  And things are very synergistic today. We have a very special guest joining us in the second hour, Dr. Stephen Greer, one of the highest level whistleblowers ever.
[01:55.000 --> 02:07.000]  And of course, pushing for real disclosure on all the secret technologies and the suppression and the breakaway civilization and what's real alien connections and what's not.
[02:07.000 --> 02:25.000]  He'll be joining us in the second hour. Perfect timing. Gregory separately has put together an incredibly important report that we're going to air next segment dealing with the ultimate false flag alien invasion.
[02:25.000 --> 02:39.000]  It just went live at Bandot Video. That is being posted in FullWars.com, warning the fake alien invasion threat is real. We're going to add that to the live show feed today posting so you can find it and share it with everyone you know.
[02:39.000 --> 02:45.000]  It just went live 20 minutes ago, warning the fake alien invasion threat is real.
[02:45.000 --> 03:06.000]  And again, they're already building alien life forms here on earth with computers creating mathematic types of RNA and DNA and then creating new life forms that are not in any zoological strata of normal as they would call it evolutionary development on this planet, terra firma.
[03:06.000 --> 03:17.000]  They are artificially creating new life forms, not just the human animal time eros bottom line. We are not in Kansas anymore.
[03:17.000 --> 03:35.000]  Also mainstream news is now reporting that women who've had the COVID-19 experimental mRNA overriding system are either having permanent periods, missed periods, bleedouts and of course they're unable to get pregnant.
[03:35.000 --> 03:50.000]  They're just now discovering because they just keep losing their ability to have children because the body is now attacking the protein wall that is produced on the inside of the uterus.
[03:50.000 --> 04:07.000]  Looks like blood, it's not. It's a protein nutrient wall for the zygote, the fertilized egg to do enough nourishment to make the connection into the blood vessels of the placenta conform.
[04:07.000 --> 04:24.000]  Top scientists also predicted that looking at the Pfizer vaccine alone, that it would particularly attack the formation of the lining of the uterus and the development of the placenta, an excellent bio weapon.
[04:24.000 --> 04:31.000]  And of course they'll get away with it because it's so horrible what they're doing. Who would want to admit this was done to them?
[04:31.000 --> 04:41.000]  They've already done it in the third world. So many people now they're going to do it to you. And women that are pregnant are taking a shot with enjoyment and are losing the babies.
[04:41.000 --> 04:50.000]  But doctors that do it say, my baby's dead, it's worth it. I'm liberal. It's a sacrifice just like George Floyd was a sacrifice.
[04:50.000 --> 04:59.000]  Yes, there's no level to which the left will not bow and destroy themselves along with us.
[04:59.000 --> 05:12.000]  The equation is very simple. The bank of banks control the media, they control big pharma, they control academia, they control the military, industrial complex, they control big tech.
[05:12.000 --> 05:21.000]  And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world they have established absolute total despotism and de-immunization.
[05:21.000 --> 05:30.000]  It is the western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[05:30.000 --> 05:44.000]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opted, turned it upside down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens them.
[05:44.000 --> 05:51.000]  Because they're not only so controlled, that's why they target info wars because we understand the keys to defeating them.
[05:51.000 --> 06:15.000]  The only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that video. So we double your efforts. We're all in this together.
[06:15.000 --> 06:43.000]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[06:43.000 --> 06:55.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting World Wide. It's Alex Jones.
[06:55.000 --> 07:08.000]  Well, tomorrow's the news today. We told you last year, in March, we had the clips. And we told you again in December, we had the top scientists back in Europe.
[07:08.000 --> 07:23.000]  And we told you again a few months ago, Dr. Sherry Penn, that women should expect to grow tumors in their uteruses and become sterile after taking the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines.
[07:23.000 --> 07:29.000]  And right after they began to take them, they said, oh, tumors will form, but they're healthy. They're not a problem.
[07:29.000 --> 07:38.000]  Oh, but your uterus lining will now be a giant wall of swollen tumors. So you won't be able to ever have children anymore.
[07:38.000 --> 07:45.000]  And of course, you will have horrible menstrual cycles, either always having a menstrual cycle or not having one or having it off and on.
[07:45.000 --> 07:53.000]  And then they're going to recommend hysterectomies, which is the surgical removal of the uterus.
[07:53.000 --> 08:02.000]  And now the Chicago Tribune is reporting on it. Isn't that liberal? Isn't it loving?
[08:02.000 --> 08:12.000]  And all over the world, they're banning the vaccines. Oh, did you know that 99% of Japan has refused the shot? Oh, they got the memo.
[08:12.000 --> 08:23.000]  I remember when Bill Gates about a year ago was on Japanese TV and they said, some are saying this is depopulation on a Wuhan and that the UN is taking over and this is going to be about depopulation in the vaccine.
[08:23.000 --> 08:32.000]  And Bill Gates looks at the presenter and he goes, this is an English Japanese TV. He goes, oh, well, there'll be different vaccines for different groups in different parts of the world.
[08:32.000 --> 08:40.000]  The Japanese presenter goes, oh, I mean, to them, it's all about dominance. Japanese are nice folks if they think you're in charge.
[08:40.000 --> 08:48.000]  And that's, oh, Bill Gates says, I mean, the Japanese aren't dumb. He said, hey, we're not going to give you that one. OK, buddy.
[08:48.000 --> 08:59.000]  The Japanese are already having 1.2 children apiece. That is a mother and a father. So they're already basically an extinct population within 100 years.
[08:59.000 --> 09:09.000]  So there's no need to give them the vaccine. Their government's saying, oh, no, you're not taking it. Don't worry. That's for everybody else.
[09:09.000 --> 09:16.000]  Remember two months ago, India banned it. Oh, even Reuters reported the Pfizer shot was banned.
[09:16.000 --> 09:22.000]  But mainstream corporate media and News Guard owned by Bill Gates came out and fact checked.
[09:22.000 --> 09:28.000]  They didn't tell you that the parent company was Microsoft and said I was a liar.
[09:28.000 --> 09:39.000]  See, when you realize all this is going on and that they're giving millions of children neurological disorders with tainted polio, live virus vaccines.
[09:39.000 --> 09:50.000]  Oh, then when you see LeBron James up there talking about an evil white people are but doesn't criticize kind of what they're doing, you know what an evil soul is.
[09:50.000 --> 09:59.000]  You're not going to see people out riding the streets over getting sterilized or getting narcolepsy or another neurological disorder.
[09:59.000 --> 10:07.000]  No, no, no, because that's not fashionable. It's fashionable when there's a questionable shooting or an event to burn down the cities and, you know, demand juries.
[10:07.000 --> 10:15.000]  Do what you say. That's mob rule. I think some of the comments online on Twitter and also an enforce. Jones, why are you siding with the white man?
[10:15.000 --> 10:25.000]  That's so stupid. Even if chauvin was guilty, which is questionable, major reasonable doubt.
[10:25.000 --> 10:31.000]  I don't care who's black or white. I'd say you got to acquit because of the election meddling.
[10:31.000 --> 10:44.000]  And that's what a jury is as an election. It's a vote of that jury with the president weighing in with Nancy Pelosi and waters weighing in in riots all over the country saying
[10:44.000 --> 10:49.000]  if you don't convict him, we'll burn everything down and we know where you live.
[10:49.000 --> 10:57.000]  If that isn't jury tampering, you know, what's the mafia do in in famous cases where the mob mob sent to jail for about 30, 40 years?
[10:57.000 --> 11:03.000]  Because they simply found out where juror lived and called them and said, we know where you live. You better vote right.
[11:03.000 --> 11:07.000]  That's jury tampering. That's a serious crime.
[11:07.000 --> 11:14.000]  But in today's world, it's a good thing. It's a loving thing. It's a wonderful thing. And so that's why this is so important.
[11:14.000 --> 11:25.000]  And then we've got new videos out where we've got this latest footage of the young lady with the butcher knife trying to stab the other black people.
[11:25.000 --> 11:37.000]  Micaela Bryant, well, old LeBron James came out, posted a photo of the cop and said, you're next. I wish he'd say that to me, just easy paying on the death camps, but that's actually millions of slaves.
[11:37.000 --> 11:42.000]  You don't care about that. No, no, he says, look, kind of do what they want. I don't get involved politics.
[11:42.000 --> 11:46.000]  But oh, when it's running down America, he does with his $500 million.
[11:46.000 --> 11:55.000]  Bitch, you know, the man's coming after him when he lives in a big gay community guarded by police and private security, but he don't want you to be able to have it because he does whatever he's told.
[11:55.000 --> 11:59.000]  He's a narcissistic devil.
[11:59.000 --> 12:06.000]  And what is seeing and do they ran video edited calling it a little girl in a schoolyard fight.
[12:06.000 --> 12:12.000]  And editing out the knife and so did NBC News. NBC News aired video didn't show the knife.
[12:12.000 --> 12:18.000]  On purpose as of yesterday was already been out over a day and it gets worse. They edited out the 911 call.
[12:18.000 --> 12:24.000]  When it's black people calling the police saying she's stabbing people, she's got a knife, help us.
[12:24.000 --> 12:38.000]  And then that evil cracker head shows up while she's lunging and stabbing people and shoots her and NBC News edits it out on the 911 call and on the video.
[12:38.000 --> 12:47.000]  And they're still calling CNN still calling this another brutal attack and a black baby that died.
[12:47.000 --> 12:53.000]  Meanwhile, real young black children and white children got shot and killed and stabbed and drowned.
[12:53.000 --> 12:57.000]  You know, by crazy people all over the country since then.
[12:57.000 --> 13:04.000]  And when a little black girl is at a drive through and black men gang related shoot her eight times and she dies.
[13:04.000 --> 13:10.000]  You don't even see a picture of her because she's black and blacks killed her.
[13:10.000 --> 13:19.000]  But when a white cracker head does something even saving black people, why the ever they need to burn because in the new religion of the new world order.
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.000]  It's common white people that are bad.
[13:22.000 --> 13:32.000]  And we all need to fight with each other while the banks turn off the power, devalue the dollar, shell out the country, collapse the borders, hand everything over to communist China.
[13:32.000 --> 13:38.000]  Kim trellis poison the water fetus chemo pump fluoride into our people.
[13:38.000 --> 13:44.000]  It's absolutely insane.
[13:44.000 --> 13:51.000]  And what the police have become in the inner cities of this country are babysitters.
[13:51.000 --> 13:59.000]  For a bunch of homeless people and meth heads and drug dealers and pimps and crazy people.
[13:59.000 --> 14:07.000]  And they're black and they're white. I've been all over this country. Man, I've been all over Florida, all over Texas, all over New York, all over California, all over Washington, all over the Midwest.
[14:07.000 --> 14:11.000]  I've seen it. Nice, happy neighborhoods of middle class people.
[14:11.000 --> 14:17.000]  And then you go into the inner cities run by Democrats.
[14:17.000 --> 14:22.000]  And it's hell on earth.
[14:22.000 --> 14:30.000]  And there is the degeneration of civilization happening. And there are degenerate black people and white people in Hispanics and crazy homeless people everywhere.
[14:30.000 --> 14:39.000]  And there's muggings and robings and killings and all these old people living in houses with their doors boarded up with a shotgun, hoping somebody didn't break in and kill them.
[14:39.000 --> 14:48.000]  And the government wants their guns now to the old white ladies and the old black ladies and the old people.
[14:48.000 --> 14:53.000]  For the blue collar folks still living in the neighborhood who can't get out because they're taking care of their mama down the street.
[14:53.000 --> 15:00.000]  And they got a board up their doors at night and now the Democrats want their guns.
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  It's incredible.
[15:02.000 --> 15:19.000]  I'll be covering that with Stuart Rhodes, third hour in studio Oathkeepers to talk about the collapse of this republic and how we get back politically on offense to turn this around.
[15:19.000 --> 15:24.000]  And then before that happens, Dr. Stephen Greer, the whistleblower on suppressed technology and more will be joining us about the ultimate false flag.
[15:24.000 --> 15:32.000]  The fake alien invasion with all this advanced secret technology that they're telling your aliens, it's the breakaway shadow government.
[15:32.000 --> 15:38.000]  We've got a very powerful special report that we're going to play coming up.
[15:38.000 --> 15:43.000]  And then Matt Bracken pops in during the fourth hour.
[15:43.000 --> 15:47.000]  Please don't forget without you spreading the word without your prayer, we won't be here without you buying products.
[15:47.000 --> 16:03.000]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[16:03.000 --> 16:09.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[16:09.000 --> 16:11.000]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[16:11.000 --> 16:14.000]  Both their objective being world domination.
[16:14.000 --> 16:18.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[16:18.000 --> 16:26.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is in hand.
[16:26.000 --> 16:29.000]  The globalist feared this film made 14 years ago.
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.000]  It is the blueprint for their plan to take over the world.
[16:31.000 --> 16:33.000]  It is the blueprint for the great reset.
[16:33.000 --> 16:41.000]  It is in-game blueprint for global enslavement, available right now at infowarstore.com with a zero country code meaning you can make copies of it anywhere in the world.
[16:41.000 --> 16:45.000]  I strongly suggest you get the film in-game at infowarstore.com.
[16:45.000 --> 16:47.000]  I strongly suggest you make copies and share it.
[16:47.000 --> 16:53.000]  And if you take that action, I demand you tell others that you've given a copy too, that they make copies and share it as well.
[16:53.000 --> 16:57.000]  That will trigger distribution by proxy, meaning we the people cannot be stopped.
[16:57.000 --> 17:04.000]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made, Alpha Power.
[17:04.000 --> 17:07.000]  As you age, your body can lose testosterone over time.

[17:49.000 --> 17:52.000]  Head to infowarstore.com today.
[17:52.000 --> 17:57.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:22.000 --> 18:26.000]  I've been waiting for this and it turned into my day.
[18:26.000 --> 18:31.000]  And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail.
[18:31.000 --> 18:36.000]  Well every night, you drag me with the bright lights I found.
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.000]  There ain't no way you're slow down.
[18:40.000 --> 18:46.000]  Americans are being dealt with poisonous so-called vaccines that are really mutagenic.
[18:46.000 --> 18:49.000]  Mass testing on the public by Bill Gates and the UN.
[18:49.000 --> 18:55.280]  While world governments being announced, while the whole public is being basically brainwashed
[18:55.280 --> 19:02.880]  and culturally manipulated and poisoned, we have a breakaway civilization.
[19:02.880 --> 19:06.920]  And we have, whether it's the Russian government or the U.S. government, that is the compartmentalized
[19:06.920 --> 19:15.640]  parts of them, have released all the footage of tic-tac and triangle-shaped crafts and
[19:15.640 --> 19:25.680]  things that are doing Mach 15, Mach 20, that are making complete right turns instantly
[19:25.680 --> 19:34.080]  that the G-forces of that would smash a human into bloody pulp and that we don't have technology
[19:34.080 --> 19:37.480]  that we know of that could, with a propulsion system, do that.
[19:37.480 --> 19:41.920]  Well, the technology you see is 50 years old, ladies and gentlemen.
[19:41.920 --> 19:48.280]  And so the whole scientific dictatorship is a breakaway civilization.
[19:48.280 --> 19:51.240]  And it's above military intelligence that Q talks about.
[19:51.240 --> 19:56.680]  It's above all that stuff that people fetishize as the top of the government or the secret
[19:56.680 --> 19:58.280]  group or all of that.
[19:58.280 --> 20:02.640]  And it is a scientific cult.
[20:02.640 --> 20:09.680]  And the whole reason for world government in the systems of statements is to not just
[20:09.680 --> 20:17.680]  stop nuclear war, but to stop what they call disruptive technologies getting into the hands
[20:17.680 --> 20:26.560]  of governments, groups, organizations or peoples that the scientific dictatorship doesn't control.
[20:26.560 --> 20:29.320]  And so there are thousands of technologies that have been suppressed.
[20:29.320 --> 20:33.000]  There's a lot of this info around it that will also go out and find people that are
[20:33.000 --> 20:39.640]  quacks or cons to show their new technology and then to show that it's really a fraud.
[20:39.640 --> 20:47.320]  To then obscure the fact that there's been massive suppression of many other technologies.
[20:47.320 --> 20:50.720]  Because if you go back to the dark ages, that was just a suppression of knowledge then.
[20:50.720 --> 20:53.280]  Well, this is a new dark age we're living in.
[20:53.280 --> 20:56.040]  We think we have information, but they're destroying the language.
[20:56.040 --> 20:58.360]  They're destroying debate and destroying free speech.
[20:58.360 --> 20:59.920]  They are atomizing the family.
[20:59.920 --> 21:06.880]  They are pulling down everything that puts us on an upward, sustainable, survivable trajectory
[21:06.880 --> 21:13.080]  in the name of sustainability and the name of sustainability, they're actually destabilizing
[21:13.080 --> 21:22.600]  the planet and this whole giant human bloom that you could call it, of overpopulation,
[21:22.600 --> 21:31.840]  they are culling or preparing to cull in an emergency procedure to control the technology
[21:31.840 --> 21:37.560]  in a more manageable way and then break away themselves enjoying the fruits of it, but
[21:37.560 --> 21:42.160]  while they're at it, they're going to test all the technology, all the things on us.
[21:42.160 --> 21:46.240]  And so that's the rationale for dictatorship, total authoritarianism and to carry out the
[21:46.240 --> 21:54.320]  vicious megalomaniacal psychotic desires of this establishment.
[21:54.320 --> 21:59.960]  So 99% of people are not even aware of how this operation works, 99% of people are often
[21:59.960 --> 22:04.240]  right wing land or left wing land, they're often fantasy land and they're not even addressing
[22:04.240 --> 22:07.680]  the real way the planet actually operates.
[22:07.680 --> 22:13.200]  So it is Earth Day, which means global government day, which means post-carbon life form day,
[22:13.200 --> 22:17.640]  which means alien takeover of the planet day and whether you believe in aliens or not,
[22:17.640 --> 22:22.520]  the globalists say they are creating a new superhomo sapien that will merge with silicon
[22:22.520 --> 22:27.040]  that will be a silicon god, that's what recurs well to the heads of Google, they all say
[22:27.040 --> 22:28.040]  this.
[22:28.040 --> 22:32.360]  John Musk says he goes to meetings with them, that is their religion and so if you can't
[22:32.360 --> 22:37.200]  even debate with these transhumanists at their level, you cannot ever be taken seriously
[22:37.200 --> 22:38.200]  by them.
[22:38.200 --> 22:39.760]  People say, how does Jones know all this?
[22:39.760 --> 22:41.440]  How does Jones always way ahead?
[22:41.440 --> 22:45.280]  Because I actually study what they're up to, who they are and what they're doing.
[22:45.280 --> 22:49.240]  I didn't just make this stuff up, I'm tracking them.
[22:49.240 --> 22:52.560]  You can act like a human and grow up and face this or you can let them destroy you and your
[22:52.560 --> 22:53.560]  family.
[22:53.560 --> 22:55.680]  I believe in humanity, I believe in free will, I'm going to fight this.
[22:55.680 --> 23:02.160]  Here's Greg Reese's latest powerful report on this.
[23:02.160 --> 23:07.800]  In this historical time of awakening, there are now millions of souls across the earth
[23:07.800 --> 23:15.160]  witnessing a powerful hidden hand manipulating humanity, hidden so it has no name, so it
[23:15.160 --> 23:21.280]  does not exist in the minds of labels and names, hidden in the shadows.
[23:21.280 --> 23:23.400]  We will call it the cabal.
[23:23.400 --> 23:28.240]  This great awakening is the greatest threat the cabal has ever faced and we have seen
[23:28.240 --> 23:33.920]  this criminal cabal deploy false flag after false flag to maintain their greatest power
[23:33.920 --> 23:36.280]  and visibility.
[23:36.280 --> 23:43.000]  Here we will explore the most dire false flag event imaginable, the fake alien invasion.
[23:43.000 --> 23:47.040]  The alien UFO phenomena can be traced back for millennia.
[23:47.040 --> 23:52.360]  We could spend days going through the entire alien UFO mystery with all its fascinating
[23:52.360 --> 23:58.720]  half truths and misinformation, but these details have been made into a distraction.
[23:58.720 --> 24:03.080]  What matters is if it's possible, is the threat real?
[24:03.080 --> 24:05.280]  The technology exists.
[24:05.280 --> 24:10.920]  Before World War II, Nikola Tesla died and we are told by the FBI that his groundbreaking
[24:10.920 --> 24:13.880]  technologies disappeared.
[24:13.880 --> 24:19.360]  After the start of World War II, Dr. Walter Gerlach, an expert on the fluorescence of mercury
[24:19.360 --> 24:26.040]  ions in the strong magnetic field, was brought onto the highly classified D. Glock project,
[24:26.040 --> 24:28.640]  otherwise known as the Bell.
[24:28.640 --> 24:34.160]  Surviving documents suggest that the Bell involved strange anti-gravity and time-altering
[24:34.160 --> 24:35.840]  effects.
[24:35.840 --> 24:39.560]  After the war, the entire project disappeared.
[24:39.560 --> 24:44.880]  Several Nazi scientists came to America under Operation Paperclip, where many of them joined
[24:44.880 --> 24:52.920]  Freemason astronauts and Jack Parsons' Satanist rocket fuel scientists to form NASA.
[24:52.920 --> 24:59.080]  Prior to this, the Invention Secrecy Act of 1951 was enacted, which allowed the U.S. government
[24:59.080 --> 25:03.720]  to suppress any new technology deemed a threat to the country.
[25:03.720 --> 25:10.040]  This led to the suppression of Stanley Myers' water-fueled car, John Hutchinson's mysterious
[25:10.040 --> 25:18.320]  Hutchinson effect, and as of 2010, over 5,000 inventions have been rendered secret.
[25:18.320 --> 25:22.600]  Through all this time, UFO sightings became more common.
[25:22.600 --> 25:28.920]  The entire alien UFO phenomena becomes a part of pop culture.
[25:28.920 --> 25:32.320]  The U.S. military develops direct energy weapons.
[25:32.320 --> 25:38.400]  Inexplicable damage seen at the World Trade Center 9-11 attacks and the California wildfires
[25:38.400 --> 25:44.840]  suggest some type of advanced weapon technology that has the ability to melt glass and steel
[25:44.840 --> 25:50.840]  and burns homes into a pulverized footprint of powdered ash.
[25:50.840 --> 25:55.520]  Whistleblowers with Stephen Greer's ongoing disclosure project have witnessed government
[25:55.520 --> 26:02.040]  projects wherein civilians are abducted in fake alien abduction scenarios.
[26:02.040 --> 26:07.200]  They have seen the top-secret UFO-type crafts that our military is developing, and they
[26:07.200 --> 26:13.840]  claim it would easily fool the public as being alien technology.
[26:13.840 --> 26:19.520]  If the cabal were to deploy the fake alien invasion, it could be game over.
[26:19.520 --> 26:24.520]  The mask mandates have revealed how easily compliant the population is.
[26:24.520 --> 26:29.880]  They will believe whatever they are told, and the rest of us could be wiped out within
[26:29.880 --> 26:35.840]  weeks with direct energy weapons and whatever else they have up their sleeves.
[26:35.840 --> 26:41.520]  We are now seeing a sort of disclosure as if they are preparing us, continuing to warn
[26:41.520 --> 26:44.040]  us of the alien threat.
[26:44.040 --> 26:50.400]  We know the cabal has the will to do this, and it seems they have the means as well.
[26:50.400 --> 26:56.960]  But if we can destroy this evil cancer, then humanity has a chance.
[26:56.960 --> 27:01.240]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off.
[27:01.240 --> 27:06.960]  The success is simple, worse is had, if you're paying attention, you know we've done together.
[27:06.960 --> 27:14.320]  But I'll tell you this, the technocrats are really upping their game, and they are trying
[27:14.320 --> 27:17.000]  to destroy all independent forms of media.
[27:17.000 --> 27:22.800]  They're trying to shudder and silence the human resistance, so now is the time to understand
[27:22.800 --> 27:26.200]  that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate, and everything you warned
[27:26.200 --> 27:28.800]  your friends and family about is about to be true.
[27:28.800 --> 27:31.560]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[27:31.560 --> 27:36.720]  The power structures of the silence, those of us that they can't, but it's up to all
[27:36.720 --> 27:40.560]  of us to not let them silence any of us.
[27:40.560 --> 27:46.600]  We have the power, but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[27:46.600 --> 27:51.560]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't
[27:51.560 --> 27:52.560]  come.
[27:52.560 --> 27:58.040]  So be the polar bearer as you are.
[27:58.040 --> 28:04.840]  Big Tech is one of only a handful of domain registers that promote free speech and freedom
[28:04.840 --> 28:06.040]  of association.
[28:06.040 --> 28:10.520]  And they know that Big Tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging
[28:10.520 --> 28:13.960]  in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering.
[28:13.960 --> 28:16.960]  That's why they've been massively expanding their services.
[28:16.960 --> 28:20.720]  So whether you have domains, or want to register a domain, or want help building a website,
[28:20.720 --> 28:25.440]  or want servers, or any other major service, they've got it all and they're expanding.
[28:25.440 --> 28:31.200]  If you go to infowarsdomains.com and follow that link, you get all their services at the
[28:31.200 --> 28:37.440]  lowest price and 25% of your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund
[28:37.440 --> 28:38.440]  the info war.
[28:38.440 --> 28:42.900]  And then we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type of services that you get
[28:42.900 --> 28:43.900]  from them.
[28:43.900 --> 28:47.920]  So it's a win-win as we build a true open free internet again because the globalists
[28:47.920 --> 28:50.360]  are destroying what was open and what was free.
[28:50.360 --> 28:55.240]  So infowarsdomains.com, the revolution starts there.
[28:55.240 --> 28:57.520]  So infowarsdomains.com, take action now.
[28:57.520 --> 29:01.360]  I am a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person.
[29:01.360 --> 29:05.400]  And so as bad as things are with the globalist attack on humanity, with all the terrible
[29:05.400 --> 29:09.880]  things that are unfolding, I want you to know a lot of positive things are happening as
[29:09.880 --> 29:10.880]  well.
[29:10.880 --> 29:14.720]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things the general public doesn't get to see.
[29:14.720 --> 29:19.640]  And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs, or members of Congress, or even folks in
[29:19.640 --> 29:27.120]  Hollywood, or mainstream media, or industry, people are really, really away from the establishment.
[29:27.120 --> 29:31.240]  They don't want to go along with the globalists, but they're scared, they're looking for leadership.
[29:31.240 --> 29:33.840]  Well, that's where infowarsdomains.com comes in.
[29:33.840 --> 29:38.200]  You fund us, you support infowarsdomains.com, you get great projects at the same time.
[29:38.200 --> 29:42.760]  We will then go out and do what the globalists say is unpopular, what the globalists will
[29:42.760 --> 29:48.000]  target you for to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[29:48.000 --> 29:53.320]  That's our job, so please, keep us on air, so we can hit the barbed wire, so we can be
[29:53.320 --> 29:55.840]  the shock groups in the information war.
[29:55.840 --> 29:57.120]  Fund us at infowarsdomains.com.
[29:57.120 --> 30:03.560]  A hundred and seventy years ago, the British royal family financed scientists to develop
[30:03.560 --> 30:07.160]  a plan for scientific dictatorship worldwide.
[30:07.160 --> 30:10.880]  That grew into the robber barons, and then into the eugenics movement, Kettler, and of
[30:10.880 --> 30:12.200]  course, the rest is history.
[30:12.200 --> 30:16.680]  Our film, In Game, blueprint for global enslavement, has been censored on Amazon and many other
[30:16.680 --> 30:17.680]  big platforms.
[30:17.680 --> 30:21.320]  We're sending the documentary film back to the top of the charts.
[30:21.320 --> 30:24.400]  It's been selling online for as much as three hundred dollars a copy.
[30:24.400 --> 30:28.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have mass produced it again in the highest quality HD.
[30:28.320 --> 30:32.960]  It is available after not being available for years at infowarsdomains.com.
[30:32.960 --> 30:36.320]  We're selling it for fourteen ninety-five for one copy, as low as three ninety-five
[30:36.320 --> 30:37.320]  when you buy them in bulk.
[30:37.320 --> 30:42.000]  You share with your friends and family, and every DVD has a zero country code, meaning
[30:42.000 --> 30:44.640]  you can burn copies of it anywhere in the world.
[30:44.640 --> 30:47.280]  I'm asking you to, I'm begging you to.
[30:47.280 --> 30:51.800]  Please don't predict the great reset, the newer takeover, the fake virus, and so much
[30:51.800 --> 30:52.800]  more.
[30:52.800 --> 30:55.400]  That's why the film is evergreen and more explosive than ever.
[30:55.400 --> 31:01.000]  Get it today at infowarsstore.com.
[31:01.000 --> 31:27.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:27.000 --> 31:37.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:37.000 --> 31:48.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:48.000 --> 32:05.760]  I wrote this deadline about an hour ago before it went live.
[32:05.760 --> 32:10.120]  It's got the live show feeding it so much more, and I mean every word of it when I say
[32:10.120 --> 32:11.120]  it.
[32:11.120 --> 32:12.120]  Watch live.
[32:12.120 --> 32:24.120]  First day is a declaration of war against all carbon-based life forms on planet Earth.
[32:24.120 --> 32:30.640]  Two plus two equals four.
[32:30.640 --> 32:40.320]  And now we rail against the crown, another ragtag band declaring independence.
[32:40.320 --> 32:42.600]  Let me just do this.
[32:42.600 --> 32:48.080]  I'm going to hit the incredible new developments with the COVID vaccines that aren't vaccines,
[32:48.080 --> 32:52.840]  as even the Chicago Tribune, blood and telegraph and others report.
[32:52.840 --> 32:59.600]  Women that are taking it are months now into not having periods or having constant periods
[32:59.600 --> 33:01.920]  and having basically tumors all over their uterus.
[33:01.920 --> 33:05.360]  So you're like, well, they'll get in trouble for that.
[33:05.360 --> 33:06.360]  No, they won't.
[33:06.360 --> 33:08.960]  They got liability protection.
[33:08.960 --> 33:12.280]  You've been hit and hit hard.
[33:12.280 --> 33:17.080]  And most women are going to stock on a syndrome out and won't even want to hear what hit them.
[33:17.080 --> 33:26.400]  They'll just let the doctors schedule them for removal of the uterus, mission complete.
[33:26.400 --> 33:28.360]  That story is up on infoawards.com.
[33:28.360 --> 33:32.880]  Chicago Tribune professors investigating COVID vaccine link have normal periods, and then
[33:32.880 --> 33:35.640]  the rest of the articles are, oh, and the tumors.
[33:35.640 --> 33:37.560]  Don't worry, that's not cancer, just tumors.
[33:37.560 --> 33:43.480]  The other vaccine causes it, and, oh, they warned Wolfgang Wudarg and others, the head
[33:43.480 --> 33:48.880]  of the EU advisory commission, back in December when they followed an emergency motion saying,
[33:48.880 --> 33:52.400]  don't authorize this emergency use.
[33:52.400 --> 33:57.160]  It looks like from studies we've seen with previous mRNA tests on animals, it's going
[33:57.160 --> 34:00.600]  to destroy the uteruses, and it's going to always attack the placenta.
[34:00.600 --> 34:02.240]  It's the same protein as the virus.
[34:02.240 --> 34:06.000]  Well, don't listen to jobs and eye injuries.
[34:06.000 --> 34:12.760]  You don't need to test this, because they've already tested it under other vaccine names
[34:12.760 --> 34:14.680]  on animals, and they knew what it would do.
[34:14.680 --> 34:15.680]  That's why they did it.
[34:15.680 --> 34:18.440]  Oh, there's no need to test it.
[34:18.440 --> 34:21.560]  It works real, real good.
[34:21.560 --> 34:27.080]  Oh, so lovely, so liberal.
[34:27.080 --> 34:34.520]  So we're going to be getting into all of that, but let me read you some other stuff.
[34:34.520 --> 34:44.800]  You know, this isn't from infowars.com, it's not from newswars.com, it's not from any of
[34:44.800 --> 34:55.560]  those evil sites, it's from Yahoo News, and what did you say?
[34:55.560 --> 35:04.480]  The Postal Service is running a, quote, covert operation program that monitors American social
[35:04.480 --> 35:13.920]  media posts and reports them for criminal prosecution and to the ADL and Southern Poverty
[35:13.920 --> 35:15.520]  Law Center.
[35:15.520 --> 35:20.480]  Now, how many times have I told you this has been going on for a while, but since Trump
[35:20.480 --> 35:27.840]  began to win the election five years ago, every major federal agency went weaponized
[35:27.840 --> 35:29.080]  against the American people.
[35:29.080 --> 35:34.680]  That is their people inside those agencies did, it's all compartmentalized.
[35:34.680 --> 35:38.560]  And what it describes here, the harassment, the databases, they then give the databases
[35:38.560 --> 35:39.560]  to leftist groups.
[35:39.560 --> 35:42.240]  What do you think big tech started doing?
[35:42.240 --> 35:47.760]  Hiring 200,000 Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL trained people just in Google starting
[35:47.760 --> 35:51.000]  six years ago, took them two years to hire them, other ones hired hundreds of thousands
[35:51.000 --> 36:00.480]  as well, Facebook, 200,000 Southern Poverty Law Center trained people to sit inside Google,
[36:00.480 --> 36:04.760]  Facebook, Twitter, they all hired similar amounts.
[36:04.760 --> 36:09.800]  Last time I checked it's over a million people been hired, it was 200,000 for Google up front.
[36:09.800 --> 36:14.200]  And they sit inside your private messages, inside your phone, even came out last year
[36:14.200 --> 36:18.000]  that people are live time on their phones and somebody will start typing saying don't
[36:18.000 --> 36:19.000]  do that.
[36:19.000 --> 36:24.240]  That's not just an alert, that's someone sending that to you, they're in all our phones.
[36:24.240 --> 36:27.320]  They're in your computers, they're in everything.
[36:27.320 --> 36:32.360]  And so it's come out that the postal service is doing that, and they are inside your stuff,
[36:32.360 --> 36:38.840]  they are inside your life, and they are tracking everywhere you go and what you do.
[36:38.840 --> 36:42.960]  And guess where they got the data, Gateway Pundit has this and we've experienced this
[36:42.960 --> 36:45.200]  ourselves.
[36:45.200 --> 36:50.000]  They get them from law enforcement investigations, they get them from civil suits, and then the
[36:50.000 --> 36:56.240]  left is all engaged in a criminal operation, they illegally give it over to the federal
[36:56.240 --> 37:03.240]  agency and vice versa all to gang up and bully the American people.
[37:03.240 --> 37:06.680]  Now a lot of folks will say well I better shut up and back down then, oh then they went for
[37:06.680 --> 37:07.680]  sure.
[37:07.680 --> 37:12.240]  But this is a true communist style takeover with big tech, it's all completely illegal,
[37:12.240 --> 37:22.320]  but we're busy worrying about George Floyd and Chauvin and all the rest of these distractions.
[37:22.320 --> 37:26.200]  It's all illegal, but don't look for Congress to do anything.
[37:26.200 --> 37:31.320]  That's just one article out of Yahoo News, U.S. Postal Services using its law enforcement
[37:31.320 --> 37:38.320]  arm to covertly track American social media posts and more.
[37:38.320 --> 37:43.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal
[37:43.680 --> 37:50.160]  have armies of hardcore criminals working at them that have got databases, their interface
[37:50.160 --> 37:56.480]  with the CIA, the FBI, they've got stingrays, they're grabbing everybody's cell phone data,
[37:56.480 --> 38:03.840]  and they just target people like the mafia had FBI powers.
[38:03.840 --> 38:07.920]  And that's all a bit in beta, they're getting ready to go fully operational against America.
[38:07.920 --> 38:11.520]  They're coming for your guns, your children, everything.
[38:11.520 --> 38:14.320]  I mean this is a organized criminal takeover.
[38:14.320 --> 38:17.920]  I had had the pleasure of experiencing it, and I actually have had the pleasure.
[38:17.920 --> 38:22.040]  I've learned so much by their attacks, so much, and when you get around them they're
[38:22.040 --> 38:26.800]  like mentally ill, weird mentally ill men, weird mentally ill women, they're all kind
[38:26.800 --> 38:33.200]  of like dysfunctional, they're mad at people with nice wives, nice husbands, a swimming
[38:33.200 --> 38:37.440]  pool, a John Deere tractor, they don't care if you're black, white, who they are.
[38:37.440 --> 38:42.720]  They want you destroyed, they're all satanic, they're all fallen, twisted, mentally ill
[38:42.720 --> 38:47.200]  people chosen by the system to carry this out because they're so bad.
[38:47.200 --> 38:53.440]  And they act like Gollum from Lord of the Rings basically, they slither around.
[38:53.440 --> 38:59.000]  And you know we've had a chance to experience this.
[38:59.000 --> 39:03.040]  And their cover for the mob rule, the burning down the cities, is black people.
[39:03.040 --> 39:08.000]  And that's in the WikiLeaks that came out, that's in the documents we got from 2015 where
[39:08.000 --> 39:13.320]  Obama had Antifa trying to stir blacks up to burn down America as the cover for bringing
[39:13.320 --> 39:17.880]  in perminal martial law to deal with the riots and then gun confiscation during that whole
[39:17.880 --> 39:18.880]  program.
[39:18.880 --> 39:24.240]  So there's that.
[39:24.240 --> 39:27.600]  Now we've got this.
[39:27.600 --> 39:34.560]  People's offering American teens money via TikTok to smuggle migrants.
[39:34.560 --> 39:36.400]  That's right, total recruiting.
[39:36.400 --> 39:41.960]  And Obyton is recruiting millions of federal employees to do the same.
[39:41.960 --> 39:42.960]  And it's all illegal.
[39:42.960 --> 39:46.280]  There's no executive order, no law, they're just doing it.
[39:46.280 --> 39:50.840]  Four Texas counties, a clear set of emergencies here which Obyton's open borders catastrophe.
[39:50.840 --> 39:55.920]  We reported on this last week, 530 million to one group to help open Europe up to the
[39:55.920 --> 39:58.160]  Muslims to the EU UN group.
[39:58.160 --> 40:02.360]  Well, it turns out Congress is launching an investigation, the Republican oversight committee
[40:02.360 --> 40:08.560]  members have gone forward and sent a letter to HHS secretary regarding a massive sole
[40:08.560 --> 40:12.600]  source contract the DHS awarded to family endeavors Inc.
[40:12.600 --> 40:16.400]  The questionable contract was awarded after a member of the Biden Harris transition team
[40:16.400 --> 40:17.800]  started working there.
[40:17.800 --> 40:20.880]  Oh, there's the letter.
[40:20.880 --> 40:23.760]  So that's going on there.
[40:23.760 --> 40:26.320]  And it's all completely illegal.
[40:26.320 --> 40:30.160]  But then they had the fact checkers like, did Jones and his team really save kids in
[40:30.160 --> 40:31.160]  the back of a car?
[40:31.160 --> 40:37.520]  No, it was a charity and a nun lovingly helping them that worked for MS-13.
[40:37.520 --> 40:38.520]  Just all crap.
[40:38.520 --> 40:39.520]  It's all illegal.
[40:39.520 --> 40:41.720]  It's all out of control.
[40:41.720 --> 40:43.720]  And we come back though.
[40:43.720 --> 40:49.360]  I'm going to tell you all about the wonderful things that are happening to women who were
[40:49.360 --> 40:54.360]  fertile, they're not now to take the vaccine, why don't you just get a hysterectomy guys?
[40:54.360 --> 40:57.080]  We'll be right back.
[40:57.080 --> 41:01.480]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021.
[41:01.480 --> 41:02.480]  And I just want to say something.
[41:02.480 --> 41:06.800]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over
[41:06.800 --> 41:07.800]  the years.
[41:07.800 --> 41:08.800]  It is truly an answer to prayer.
[41:08.800 --> 41:12.200]  And I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[41:12.200 --> 41:16.680]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you, whether you are old, whether you are
[41:16.680 --> 41:19.680]  Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter, you got red blood.
[41:19.680 --> 41:24.640]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers
[41:24.640 --> 41:29.000]  and sisters together, and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you
[41:29.000 --> 41:30.000]  over the years.
[41:30.000 --> 41:33.400]  And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[41:33.400 --> 41:37.000]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[41:37.000 --> 41:42.080]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[41:42.080 --> 41:44.400]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[41:44.400 --> 41:48.000]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've
[41:48.000 --> 41:49.000]  done.
[41:49.000 --> 41:53.520]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you, and hopefully
[41:53.520 --> 41:55.920]  God will touch your heart to continue to support Him for worse.
[41:55.920 --> 41:56.920]  God bless.
[41:56.920 --> 42:06.440]  In the early 1990s, there was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[42:06.440 --> 42:10.840]  Even before I had access to your show in the mid-1990s, I wouldn't solve that movie and
[42:10.840 --> 42:11.840]  thought, man, that was fun.
[42:11.840 --> 42:16.800]  In fact, you speak out and have your own ideas, and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining
[42:16.800 --> 42:17.800]  because you're real.
[42:17.800 --> 42:19.800]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[42:19.800 --> 42:20.800]  We're not worthy!
[42:20.800 --> 42:21.800]  We're not worthy!
[42:21.800 --> 42:22.800]  We're not worthy!
[42:22.800 --> 42:27.760]  Every day, when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you, because
[42:27.760 --> 42:30.960]  these topics are so huge, they're so real, but I'm trying to tell you the truth.
[42:30.960 --> 42:33.120]  I'm trying to get it right, and most of the time we do.
[42:33.120 --> 42:34.760]  The globalists love lying to you.
[42:34.760 --> 42:36.120]  They love manipulating you.
[42:36.120 --> 42:38.760]  They enjoy destroying humanity.
[42:38.760 --> 42:43.240]  They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[42:43.240 --> 42:46.240]  That, for me, is really set down and disgusting.
[42:46.240 --> 42:52.160]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole InfoWars crew that we will never join
[42:52.160 --> 42:53.160]  the globalists.
[42:53.160 --> 43:02.480]  We will never know who we manipulate you, because we know we're all in this together.
[43:02.480 --> 43:03.480]  Randy Dewright.
[43:03.480 --> 43:04.480]  Randy Dewright.
[43:04.480 --> 43:05.480]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[43:05.480 --> 43:06.480]  Go ahead.
[43:06.480 --> 43:08.920]  Well, first of all, let me say I love your products.
[43:08.920 --> 43:14.440]  I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[43:14.440 --> 43:19.920]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[43:19.920 --> 43:25.160]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous,
[43:25.160 --> 43:26.160]  actually.
[43:26.160 --> 43:29.240]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[43:29.240 --> 43:33.280]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[43:33.280 --> 43:36.840]  what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[43:36.840 --> 43:40.880]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a
[43:40.880 --> 43:46.360]  period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working,
[43:46.360 --> 43:52.280]  this is wonderful, you know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so
[43:52.280 --> 43:59.120]  anyway, it worked wonderfully, and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[43:59.120 --> 44:04.720]  The federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of non-consenting
[44:04.720 --> 44:10.320]  patients, hundreds of hospitals in the U.S. injected healthy men, women, and children
[44:10.320 --> 44:16.600]  with uranium and plutonium at dosage levels ranging from non-therapeutic to lethal, killing
[44:16.600 --> 44:18.600]  many of the test subjects.
[44:18.600 --> 44:23.160]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement is one of the most important films ever made.
[44:23.160 --> 44:26.680]  Fourteen years ago, we tracked and documented the Boulderburg Group's activities, and
[44:26.680 --> 44:30.160]  they're planned for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus.
[44:30.160 --> 44:33.920]  The film now is more important than ever, when it's shot to number one on Amazon last year,
[44:33.920 --> 44:34.920]  they banned it.
[44:34.920 --> 44:39.280]  We have it back in print, available now at infowarstore.com, selling them as low as
[44:39.280 --> 44:43.720]  $3.95 a piece of the environment bulk, and there's a zero country code, so anywhere on
[44:43.720 --> 44:44.720]  the planet, you can make copies.
[44:44.720 --> 44:46.600]  In fact, I want you to make copies.
[44:46.600 --> 44:52.440]  You are the Paul Revere's, 1776 Worldwide, 1776 Worldwide, in-game blueprint for global
[44:52.440 --> 45:01.600]  enslavement, available now at infowarstore.com.
[45:01.600 --> 45:31.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[45:31.440 --> 45:53.840]  We have a lot of prestigious scientists come out and say that this vaccine won't protect
[45:53.840 --> 45:55.440]  you, it's not a vaccine.
[45:55.440 --> 45:59.600]  No government would ever approve mRNA therapy like this, because it caused so many deaths
[45:59.600 --> 46:03.400]  in the animal studies, and that's why you study on animals, because they're similar
[46:03.400 --> 46:08.160]  to us, and now it's following that path, so this is just what we thought it was, a giant
[46:08.160 --> 46:14.760]  test in how to orderly, may must, soft kill us, and then finally get rid of us.
[46:14.760 --> 46:18.240]  So we're going to be looking at that here in just a moment.
[46:18.240 --> 46:23.080]  We have a lot of great products that you already need to enrich your life, but also make this
[46:23.080 --> 46:24.080]  broadcast possible.
[46:24.080 --> 46:28.440]  So when I thank you for your support, I want to explain something.
[46:28.440 --> 46:30.360]  Here's the point, we will not be on air.
[46:30.360 --> 46:32.320]  I've gone out and gotten a few sponsors.
[46:32.320 --> 46:35.720]  That only pays for a small amount of the operations here, okay?
[46:35.720 --> 46:39.480]  And they have been trying to shut us down, as you know, and I've been fighting as hard
[46:39.480 --> 46:40.920]  as I can to keep us on air.
[46:40.920 --> 46:44.960]  So please support our local affiliates, spread the word about them, give them a donation,
[46:44.960 --> 46:45.960]  support their sponsors.
[46:45.960 --> 46:50.240]  Whatever you do, spread the word, please be praying for us, and yes, hit things you need
[46:50.240 --> 46:52.840]  at infowarstore.com.
[46:52.840 --> 46:55.200]  Take these privacy pouches.
[46:55.200 --> 46:59.920]  They're 98% effective, they're underneath the cell tower, some of them still beam through.
[46:59.920 --> 47:03.880]  We ordered dozens of these from different distributors over the years, and wouldn't
[47:03.880 --> 47:06.880]  sell them because they weren't close to 100%.
[47:06.880 --> 47:11.920]  These are the highest rated you can find for the price and for the size, and we're really
[47:11.920 --> 47:12.920]  proud of them.
[47:12.920 --> 47:13.920]  It's hard to keep them in stock.
[47:13.920 --> 47:15.920]  We sell them for $19.95.
[47:15.920 --> 47:17.480]  They cost us a lot to get.
[47:17.480 --> 47:20.280]  They're little Faraday cages, so your phone isn't tracking you.
[47:20.280 --> 47:21.280]  You're not being tracked.
[47:21.280 --> 47:23.760]  You're not being controlled.
[47:23.760 --> 47:29.440]  It gets you in the habit of remembering that these things are tracking you and are tracing
[47:29.440 --> 47:30.440]  you.
[47:30.440 --> 47:34.520]  So get the privacy pockets at infowarstore.com in four different great colors, and also give
[47:34.520 --> 47:35.520]  them as gifts.
[47:35.520 --> 47:39.720]  It's a great way to educate friends and family, and to use the phone less because if you put
[47:39.720 --> 47:45.240]  the phone in there, you realize it's not really a phone, it's a surveillance, globalist, contact
[47:45.240 --> 47:47.800]  tracer device in the future.
[47:47.800 --> 47:49.920]  These are going to be more and more important in the world we're going into, so I would
[47:49.920 --> 47:54.240]  like to bet your weight and get in the habit of that now.
[47:54.240 --> 47:55.240]  Separately, very, very proud of folks.
[47:55.240 --> 48:00.320]  You have bought a lot of the new reprint of In-Game Blueprint for Global Enslavedment.
[48:00.320 --> 48:01.320]  It's a catch-22, though.
[48:01.320 --> 48:06.320]  I'm selling them for $395 apiece, and I thought some people would buy one for $14.95, you
[48:06.320 --> 48:11.160]  buy one, you buy five, you know, it's like $8 apiece.
[48:11.160 --> 48:13.880]  Down to $395 apiece if you get 10 or more.
[48:13.880 --> 48:17.960]  Almost everyone's getting the 10 pack, which, again, is great.
[48:17.960 --> 48:21.080]  All you do is share them, give them a copy of the library, give them a copy of your
[48:21.080 --> 48:22.600]  police department.
[48:22.600 --> 48:24.080]  People are really ready to see this film.
[48:24.080 --> 48:27.600]  The problem is we're not actually funding ourselves now because we're not making a lot
[48:27.600 --> 48:28.960]  of money out of it, but that's okay.
[48:28.960 --> 48:29.960]  I'm not bitching.
[48:29.960 --> 48:33.520]  I'm not complaining because what really matters is getting the film out there, plus it has
[48:33.520 --> 48:38.720]  a zero country code, plays anywhere in the world, and it doesn't have copy protection
[48:38.720 --> 48:39.720]  on it.
[48:39.720 --> 48:43.440]  I want you to make copies and hand this out to people, so please get those old DVD burners
[48:43.440 --> 48:49.440]  out and let's go to town on the globalist because they've been censoring this film massively.
[48:49.440 --> 48:54.560]  And then finally, I have twisted the arm of our great national food supplier because
[48:54.560 --> 48:58.560]  all the other suppliers have gone up on price like four or five times in just the last year.
[48:58.560 --> 48:59.960]  They've already gone up on price twice.
[48:59.960 --> 49:03.320]  They're still the lowest price you're going to find for high-quality, horrible food.
[49:03.320 --> 49:10.840]  But if you're paired with Alex.com, all the horrible food is 10% off yet, again, for everyone.
[49:10.840 --> 49:16.520]  It's the globalist destabilization emergency sale, 10% off all swarable foods.
[49:16.520 --> 49:21.240]  The globalists have crept out of the shadows around openly trying to destabilize the whole
[49:21.240 --> 49:22.240]  planet.
[49:22.240 --> 49:25.560]  In my opinion, now is the time, why am I reading this?
[49:25.560 --> 49:26.960]  I wrote it.
[49:26.960 --> 49:28.360]  Now is the time to get ready.
[49:28.360 --> 49:34.160]  Now is the time to be prepared before they launch the next cascade of events, wars, new
[49:34.160 --> 49:38.040]  bio-weapon releases, new fear-mongering, new hoaxes.
[49:38.040 --> 49:40.560]  This is swarable food that lasts decades.
[49:40.560 --> 49:44.160]  It's high-quality, and it funds our operation, and there's a sale going.
[49:44.160 --> 49:47.040]  Everyone needs a three-month, a six-month, a year's supply.
[49:47.040 --> 49:48.040]  They have month supplies.
[49:48.040 --> 49:49.280]  They have a lot of other great items.
[49:49.280 --> 49:50.560]  We have their full catalog.
[49:50.560 --> 49:53.880]  The lowest price you're going to find anywhere, and they're the biggest company now in the
[49:53.880 --> 49:55.280]  U.S. because they've been around 14 years.
[49:55.280 --> 50:02.840]  They just became the biggest because they're so good, at infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[50:02.840 --> 50:05.040]  infowarstore.com is the umbrella site.
[50:05.040 --> 50:06.040]  Prepare with Alex.com.
[50:06.040 --> 50:10.120]  It takes you right to the subpage to find all of that right there.
[50:10.120 --> 50:12.840]  That alpha power is back in stock as well.
[50:12.840 --> 50:13.840]  Okay.
[50:13.840 --> 50:14.840]  Let me just read you these headlines.
[50:14.840 --> 50:16.480]  This is out of the New York Post.
[50:16.480 --> 50:24.920]  Biden warns if Americans don't get COVID jabs, you mean mRNA, they might have to cancel
[50:24.920 --> 50:29.480]  July 4th as if the federal government has that power.
[50:29.480 --> 50:34.160]  This is all an exercise in mind control and teaching you that you're bad and you're dirty
[50:34.160 --> 50:37.320]  and you're evil with all this nonsensical six-foot apart, the mask.
[50:37.320 --> 50:40.480]  It's never going to end until you end it.
[50:40.480 --> 50:45.160]  The police finally in Canada have been refusing to enforce the permanent lockdown.
[50:45.160 --> 50:50.440]  Burning man organizers say COVID-19 vaccines may be mandatory to attend Festival USA Day.
[50:50.440 --> 50:53.400]  So you can go there and give each other diseases.
[50:53.400 --> 50:57.560]  You can go take any illegal drugs you want, supposedly nihilistic, oh, but you will take
[50:57.560 --> 51:00.160]  the mRNA sacrament to go.
[51:00.160 --> 51:03.560]  A lot of folks are canceling, so they're now backing off of that.
[51:03.560 --> 51:07.600]  It's just, again, pathetic, demonic, joke, Silicon Valley.
[51:07.600 --> 51:11.640]  And remember, California law says it's not illegal to knowingly give somebody hepatitis
[51:11.640 --> 51:12.640]  or HIV now.
[51:12.640 --> 51:16.800]  So the same liberals say, oh, it's okay for me to give you HIV knowingly or hepatitis,
[51:16.800 --> 51:21.640]  but oh, which are real viruses, especially hepatitis, oh, but don't worry.
[51:21.640 --> 51:24.320]  You can take your COVID test to go here.
[51:24.320 --> 51:25.720]  It's all about the world ID.
[51:25.720 --> 51:27.120]  It's all about corporate fascism.
[51:27.120 --> 51:32.920]  I mean, corporations enforce the adoption of this.
[51:32.920 --> 51:33.920]  Everybody sick.
[51:33.920 --> 51:42.000]  HIV patients in California expose others to disease knowingly will no longer face charges.
[51:42.000 --> 51:47.600]  Dems send anti-vaxxer hit list to big tech heads amid vaccine information war.
[51:47.600 --> 51:51.880]  Big info wars.com article, including Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[51:51.880 --> 51:52.880]  And here's what's crazy.
[51:52.880 --> 51:57.720]  They've banned some of the vaccines in different parts of the world everywhere.
[51:57.720 --> 52:01.960]  That is, every one of the big six vaccines has been banned one place or another.
[52:01.960 --> 52:04.800]  Pfizer's been banned in the second most populous country in the world.
[52:04.800 --> 52:07.640]  A whole bunch of the other vaccines have been banned in 20 plus countries.
[52:07.640 --> 52:09.080]  We're talking about the AstraZeneca.
[52:09.080 --> 52:10.080]  It goes on and on.
[52:10.080 --> 52:13.720]  The Johnson and Johnson has been stopped in the United States.
[52:13.720 --> 52:18.240]  And then they look at us like we got 14 heads and go, you crazy people, you're not allowed
[52:18.240 --> 52:22.520]  to have medical doctors showing all these scientific reports on Facebook.
[52:22.520 --> 52:28.480]  You're not going to have DeSantis having hearing two weeks ago with over 20 members of the
[52:28.480 --> 52:32.320]  medical team and some of the top scientists in the world saying that we've been lied to
[52:32.320 --> 52:36.080]  about the severity of COVID, but also about the vaccine dangers.
[52:36.080 --> 52:44.560]  The UN is the only group that is allowed to tell us what's going on with the vaccine because
[52:44.560 --> 52:47.480]  they're our boss now.
[52:47.480 --> 52:48.480]  And it continues.
[52:48.480 --> 52:52.520]  Here's a prediction I made that's making the rounds for March of last year on Facebook.
[52:52.520 --> 52:53.520]  Whoa.
[52:53.520 --> 52:57.880]  He literally predicted COVID variants last March and that those would be used after you
[52:57.880 --> 53:01.920]  had the vaccine to say, still, you've got to remain locked down.
[53:01.920 --> 53:05.560]  I didn't predict that it's in the John Hopkins reports.
[53:05.560 --> 53:08.280]  They already war game it all out.
[53:08.280 --> 53:10.280]  People keep giving me the credit for all this.
[53:10.280 --> 53:11.280]  Okay.
[53:11.280 --> 53:13.000]  Got a whole boat blueprint here.
[53:13.000 --> 53:17.200]  Just like Wolfgang Wodarg and the former head of Pfizer went public, their chief scientist
[53:17.200 --> 53:19.080]  and said, this will attack the placenta.
[53:19.080 --> 53:21.160]  This will grow tumors on the uterus.
[53:21.160 --> 53:24.840]  That's what the same protein that's in the virus, very common protein, is in the brain
[53:24.840 --> 53:25.920]  and in the uterus.
[53:25.920 --> 53:28.640]  The placenta is basically made out of it, 100%.
[53:28.640 --> 53:29.920]  It will kill the babies.
[53:29.920 --> 53:31.400]  It will sterilize the women.
[53:31.400 --> 53:33.400]  And now it's all over the damn news.
[53:33.400 --> 53:38.440]  I mean, it was just the top scientists, people like, how did, it's all over Twitter.
[53:38.440 --> 53:39.440]  Kills us right again.
[53:39.440 --> 53:40.440]  Good God.
[53:40.440 --> 53:44.920]  Here he is saying, and I'm not trying to take credit away from me, but of course I'm right.
[53:44.920 --> 53:48.520]  It's a damn attack.
[53:48.520 --> 53:52.720]  Mammograms are picking up swelling in women's breasts following the COVID vaccine and in
[53:52.720 --> 53:56.920]  their uterus, and they say, don't worry about the miscarriage, don't worry about fears of
[53:56.920 --> 53:57.920]  cancer.
[53:57.920 --> 54:01.480]  Just don't get cancer screened for a year or the old Sinian for surgery because they
[54:01.480 --> 54:02.480]  are tumors.
[54:02.480 --> 54:03.480]  But no big deal.
[54:03.480 --> 54:06.480]  They're the good kind.
[54:06.480 --> 54:07.480]  Liberal.
[54:07.480 --> 54:09.880]  So let's continue right here.
[54:09.880 --> 54:17.840]  Chicago Tribune, professors investigating COVID vaccine link to abnormal periods and
[54:17.840 --> 54:22.320]  tumors and bleeding and miscarriages.
[54:22.320 --> 54:25.840]  Big article up on infowars.com.
[54:25.840 --> 54:31.160]  And here's our article from last week about it, tomorrow's news today, disturbing unvaccinated
[54:31.160 --> 54:35.960]  women claim unusual menstrual cycles and miscarriages that are being near recently vaccinated individuals
[54:35.960 --> 54:40.640]  because it's called viral shedding.
[54:40.640 --> 54:43.480]  And what did Wolfgang Wodarg and others warm when they looked at it?
[54:43.480 --> 54:47.040]  These are top neurologists and scientists and they went and read the papers and they
[54:47.040 --> 54:53.400]  published emergency papers with hundreds of pages with links to hundreds of studies saying
[54:53.400 --> 54:58.640]  this is going to attack the reproductive systems of these women and then it makes the cells
[54:58.640 --> 55:06.880]  create virus mutations, which even USA Today and even NPR admitted that the vaccines, the
[55:06.880 --> 55:12.760]  mRNA vaccines and others are going to create new strains, which magically, what do they
[55:12.760 --> 55:13.760]  do again?
[55:13.760 --> 55:14.760]  What does Bill Gates want?
[55:14.760 --> 55:19.480]  Bill Gates has been testing on animals for decades, viruses that sterilize, viruses that
[55:19.480 --> 55:22.720]  interrupt reproductive systems.
[55:22.720 --> 55:25.320]  And now magically it's happening, is it?
[55:25.320 --> 55:29.600]  He wants you to die, he wants to depopulate you, he's worried about overpopulation, and
[55:29.600 --> 55:33.560]  then magically he runs a program and that starts happening.
[55:33.560 --> 55:37.440]  Wow, it's like two plus two equals four, incredible.
[55:37.440 --> 55:45.280]  Dr. Stephen Greer, from the Disclosure Project straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com
[55:45.280 --> 55:47.640]  tomorrow's news today.
[55:47.640 --> 55:51.200]  So many people say to me, Alex, please stop being so negative.
[55:51.200 --> 55:57.240]  Well, for me, admitting I've gotten a rotten tooth and going in a root canal is not negative.
[55:57.240 --> 56:02.120]  It hurts, it stinks, it's got pus coming out of it, I go to the doctor, they fix it.
[56:02.120 --> 56:03.120]  That's not negative.
[56:03.120 --> 56:04.960]  I'm not living in denial.
[56:04.960 --> 56:09.840]  And so think of globalism as being hidden as an infection that we feel yet, but now
[56:09.840 --> 56:13.200]  it's come to the surface, that's actually a positive thing.
[56:13.200 --> 56:17.480]  And so yeah, Trump did an overall great job, they stole the election, we can't get down
[56:17.480 --> 56:18.560]  about that.
[56:18.560 --> 56:22.400]  We have forced them out in the open.
[56:22.400 --> 56:26.720]  So now they're trying to suppress us because they know they've been exposed, they're scared.
[56:26.720 --> 56:30.160]  That's why, instead of saying, oh we're a bunch of losers, look what happened, no we're
[56:30.160 --> 56:34.960]  a bunch of winners, they're trying to suppress us, let our light of truth shine and tell
[56:34.960 --> 56:36.720]  everybody what's happening.
[56:36.720 --> 56:41.520]  Your own website, your own show, my show, other articles, other videos, just keep sharing
[56:41.520 --> 56:44.240]  however you can and realize we're an information war.
[56:44.240 --> 56:48.840]  We're going to win this together and the fight starts at infowars.com.
[56:48.840 --> 56:51.840]  Gerald in South Carolina, go ahead, you're on the air, trying to move quicker.
[56:51.840 --> 56:52.840]  Hey, Alex.
[56:52.840 --> 56:53.840]  Welcome.
[56:53.840 --> 56:57.520]  Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this
[56:57.520 --> 56:58.520]  stupidity.
[56:58.520 --> 57:01.680]  I'm going to warn people, I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year, okay?
[57:01.680 --> 57:08.400]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[57:08.400 --> 57:09.880]  Living defense saved my life.
[57:09.880 --> 57:14.200]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[57:14.200 --> 57:15.640]  Living defense brought me back.
[57:15.640 --> 57:21.360]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus the same as to where we are right now.
[57:21.360 --> 57:28.400]  This is Matthew 24, verse 9, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill
[57:28.400 --> 57:35.080]  you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake, and then shall many be offended
[57:35.080 --> 57:38.400]  and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[57:38.400 --> 57:40.200]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[57:40.200 --> 57:44.640]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say,
[57:44.640 --> 57:51.920]  and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[57:51.920 --> 58:20.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[58:20.720 --> 58:27.240]  Dr. Stephen Greer is going to be joining us here on Earth Day in just about five minutes,
[58:27.240 --> 58:32.480]  and it is serendipity, synchronicity, destiny that one of our record reporters, Greg Rees,
[58:32.480 --> 58:37.720]  just so happened to put out this report that parallels what Dr. Greer is going to be talking
[58:37.720 --> 58:45.840]  about, the ultimate false flag, project blue beam on steroids, the fake alien invasion.
[58:45.840 --> 58:50.600]  What are the real extraterrestrials versus the fake ones, ladies and gentlemen?
[58:50.600 --> 58:54.320]  Here's the report.
[58:54.320 --> 58:59.960]  In this historical time of awakening, there are now millions of souls across the earth
[58:59.960 --> 59:07.320]  witnessing a powerful hidden hand manipulating humanity, hidden so it has no name, so it
[59:07.320 --> 59:13.440]  does not exist in the minds of labels and names, hidden in the shadows.
[59:13.440 --> 59:15.560]  We will call it the cabal.
[59:15.560 --> 59:20.440]  This great awakening is the greatest threat the cabal has ever faced, and we have seen
[59:20.440 --> 59:26.080]  this criminal cabal deploy false flag after false flag to maintain their greatest power
[59:26.080 --> 59:28.440]  and visibility.
[59:28.440 --> 59:35.160]  Here we will explore the most dire false flag event imaginable, the fake alien invasion.
[59:35.160 --> 59:39.200]  The alien UFO phenomena can be traced back for millennia.
[59:39.200 --> 59:44.520]  We could spend days going through the entire alien UFO mystery with all its fascinating
[59:44.520 --> 59:50.880]  half crudes and misinformation, but these details have been made into a distraction.
[59:50.880 --> 59:55.240]  What matters is if it's possible, is the threat real?
[59:55.240 --> 59:57.440]  The technology exists.
[59:57.440 --> 1:00:03.080]  Before World War II, Nikola Tesla died, and we are told by the FBI that his groundbreaking
[1:00:03.080 --> 1:00:06.040]  technologies disappeared.
[1:00:06.040 --> 1:00:11.520]  After the start of World War II, Dr. Walther Gerlach, an expert on the fluorescence of mercury
[1:00:11.520 --> 1:00:18.200]  ions in the strong magnetic field, was brought onto the highly classified D. Glock project,
[1:00:18.200 --> 1:00:20.800]  otherwise known as the Bell.
[1:00:20.800 --> 1:00:26.320]  Surviving documents suggest that the Bell involved strange anti-gravity and time-altering
[1:00:26.320 --> 1:00:28.000]  effects.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:31.720]  After the war, the entire project disappeared.
[1:00:31.720 --> 1:00:37.040]  Several Nazi scientists came to America under Operation Paperclip, where many of them joined
[1:00:37.040 --> 1:00:45.080]  Freemason astronauts and Jack Parsons' Satanist rocket fuel scientists to form NASA.
[1:00:45.080 --> 1:00:51.280]  Prior to this, the Invention Secrecy Act of 1951 was enacted, which allowed the U.S. government
[1:00:51.280 --> 1:00:55.920]  to suppress any new technology deemed a threat to the country.
[1:00:55.920 --> 1:01:02.200]  This led to the suppression of Stanley Myers' water-fueled car, John Hutchinson's mysterious
[1:01:02.200 --> 1:01:10.480]  Hutchinson effect, and as of 2010, over 5,000 inventions have been rendered secret.
[1:01:10.480 --> 1:01:14.760]  Through all this time, UFO sightings became more common.
[1:01:14.760 --> 1:01:21.080]  The entire alien UFO phenomena becomes a part of pop culture.
[1:01:21.080 --> 1:01:24.480]  The U.S. military develops direct energy weapons.
[1:01:24.480 --> 1:01:30.560]  Inexplicable damage seen at the World Trade Center 9-11 attacks and the California wildfires
[1:01:30.560 --> 1:01:37.000]  suggest some type of advanced weapon technology that has the ability to melt glass and steel
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:42.960]  and burns homes into a pulverized footprint of powdered ash.
[1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:47.680]  Whistleblowers with Stephen Greer's ongoing disclosure project have witnessed government
[1:01:47.680 --> 1:01:54.200]  projects wherein civilians are abducted in fake alien abduction scenarios.
[1:01:54.200 --> 1:01:59.360]  They have seen the top-secret UFO-type crafts that our military is developing, and they
[1:01:59.360 --> 1:02:06.000]  claim it would easily fool the public as being alien technology.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:11.680]  If the cabal were to deploy the fake alien invasion, it could be game over.
[1:02:11.680 --> 1:02:16.680]  The mask mandates have revealed how easily compliant the population is.
[1:02:16.680 --> 1:02:22.040]  They will believe whatever they are told, and the rest of us could be wiped out within
[1:02:22.040 --> 1:02:28.000]  weeks with direct energy weapons and whatever else they have up their sleeves.
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:33.680]  We are now seeing a sort of disclosure as if they are preparing us, continuing to warn
[1:02:33.680 --> 1:02:36.200]  us of the alien threat.
[1:02:36.200 --> 1:02:42.560]  We know the cabal has the will to do this, and it seems they have the means as well.
[1:02:42.560 --> 1:02:51.520]  But if we can destroy this evil cancer, then humanity has a chance.
[1:02:51.520 --> 1:02:59.440]  The globalists are purposely collapsing our world.
[1:02:59.440 --> 1:03:03.160]  They are creating insecurity, crime, war, and famine.
[1:03:03.160 --> 1:03:07.760]  All of us should do everything we can to get prepared and get ready for ourselves and
[1:03:07.760 --> 1:03:10.320]  our family's sakes, but also our community.
[1:03:10.320 --> 1:03:15.520]  And CitizensStronghold.com is the best place to go to get high-quality body armor at the
[1:03:15.520 --> 1:03:17.000]  lowest price you're going to find.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  Again, this is high-quality body armor at the lowest price you're going to find.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:24.640]  We've worked with them for years, but they can never supply enough to our audience.
[1:03:24.640 --> 1:03:26.760]  They have massively expanded their factories.
[1:03:26.760 --> 1:03:31.200]  It's made right here in America, and they're ready to ship it to you right now.
[1:03:31.200 --> 1:03:36.000]  CitizensStronghold.com, when you go there, put in promo code ALICE and get 10% off on
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  your purchases.

[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  They have it for women.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  They have it for men.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:43.280]  They have backpacks that didn't unfold and are full top body armor.
[1:03:43.280 --> 1:03:46.800]  They've got it all right now ready to ship to you, 10% off.
[1:03:46.800 --> 1:03:50.720]  And the globalists are coming to try to stop the sale of it soon.
[1:03:50.720 --> 1:03:57.720]  That's why you need to get it now at CitizensStronghold.com, promo code ALICE and get 10% off.
[1:04:20.720 --> 1:04:27.720]  All right, long before NASA existed, in every ancient culture, they have carvings and hieroglyphs
[1:04:27.720 --> 1:04:35.840]  and Sanskrit of what looks like Apache helicopters, what looks like 747s, what looks like.
[1:04:35.840 --> 1:04:39.880]  All sorts of Apache helicopters, I mean, just the beginning of it.
[1:04:39.880 --> 1:04:43.520]  Why is this carved on the walls at the Great Pyramid in Egypt?
[1:04:43.520 --> 1:04:45.360]  What's going on here?
[1:04:45.360 --> 1:04:49.360]  And then you have all the secret societies trying to suppress knowledge about this, going
[1:04:49.360 --> 1:04:57.960]  back you have Genesis describing things that can only be what we see in modern uofology
[1:04:57.960 --> 1:05:03.640]  or close encounters of third kind is what the Book of Ezekiel sounds like to me.
[1:05:03.640 --> 1:05:07.480]  So what's really happening here?
[1:05:07.480 --> 1:05:09.200]  We know we don't know the real history of the planet.
[1:05:09.200 --> 1:05:12.800]  We know it's been shrouded in secrecy.
[1:05:12.800 --> 1:05:17.680]  But now, not since the end of World War II, have we seen so much unidentified flying
[1:05:17.680 --> 1:05:19.400]  object activity?
[1:05:19.400 --> 1:05:22.840]  A lot of people say, well, are there unidentified flying objects?
[1:05:22.840 --> 1:05:24.520]  Well, that's like saying, are there aliens?
[1:05:24.520 --> 1:05:26.400]  We know there's a lot of unidentified flying objects.
[1:05:26.400 --> 1:05:27.640]  That's anything that you don't know what it is.
[1:05:27.640 --> 1:05:31.320]  Could be a weather balloon, could be sunspots, who knows?
[1:05:31.320 --> 1:05:35.840]  But clearly, Hollywood and the establishment is preparing us for something big.
[1:05:35.840 --> 1:05:37.520]  We've got pieces of this puzzle.
[1:05:37.520 --> 1:05:42.720]  But Dr. Stephen Greer is one of the world's foremost, about the most foremost, authorities
[1:05:42.720 --> 1:05:49.040]  on UFOs, extraterrestrial intelligence, and technologies, initiating peaceful contact
[1:05:49.040 --> 1:05:51.320]  with interstellar civilizations for over 30 years.
[1:05:51.320 --> 1:05:55.440]  I'm not going to go over his whole background of the secret projects he worked in, but he's
[1:05:55.440 --> 1:06:00.880]  certainly predicted a lot of what's unfolding now, and that gives him a lot of credibility.
[1:06:00.880 --> 1:06:05.600]  He's also made quite a few films, like Unacknowledged and Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind, and
[1:06:05.600 --> 1:06:12.560]  Contact Has Begun, Dr. Stephen Greer on Twitter, Facebook, Dr. Stephen Greer, Instagram, Dr.
[1:06:12.560 --> 1:06:20.640]  Stephen Greer, and the website, www.seriousdisclosure.com, like in Serious the Dog Star.
[1:06:20.640 --> 1:06:21.640]  So we appreciate him coming.
[1:06:21.640 --> 1:06:24.760]  Oh, we've got about 45 minutes in airtime in this hour.
[1:06:24.760 --> 1:06:29.200]  I could talk to him for 10 hours, but if you'll just kind of boil down the big picture from
[1:06:29.200 --> 1:06:35.280]  your big, vast pool of knowledge, 35,000 foot view, and then drill into all these accelerating
[1:06:35.280 --> 1:06:39.560]  occurrences that we're seeing in mainstream media and the Pentagon, basically saying get
[1:06:39.560 --> 1:06:43.600]  ready for some major disclosures that you've been talking about for so long.
[1:06:43.600 --> 1:06:44.600]  Sure.
[1:06:44.600 --> 1:06:47.200]  And a great intro by Greg Rees.
[1:06:47.200 --> 1:06:49.320]  He did a great job with that, by the way.
[1:06:49.320 --> 1:06:55.760]  And I think what the public needs to understand is this is a 75-year strategic plan that we're
[1:06:55.760 --> 1:07:01.920]  seeing unfurl before our eyes, and it's very worrisome, because the prediction was made
[1:07:01.920 --> 1:07:08.600]  by no less than the Nazi rocket scientist, Werner von Braun, to his spokesperson, Dr.
[1:07:08.600 --> 1:07:17.720]  Carol Rosen, who will be with me on this coming Sunday, the 25th of April, doing a 20th anniversary
[1:07:17.720 --> 1:07:19.760]  of the Disclosure Project event.
[1:07:19.760 --> 1:07:27.320]  And he told her on his deathbed in 1974 and 5 and 6 that there had been a plan made where
[1:07:27.320 --> 1:07:34.360]  they would hoax an alien threat, and that this alien threat would be rolled out slowly
[1:07:34.360 --> 1:07:39.520]  through an indoctrination and psychological warfare, but there would be a scaling up with
[1:07:39.520 --> 1:07:41.680]  all kinds of staged wars.
[1:07:41.680 --> 1:07:48.280]  And she actually saw when she worked for an aerospace contractor as one of the first women
[1:07:48.280 --> 1:07:55.160]  executives, a plan in this 1970s up and through now, to this day, outlining things like the
[1:07:55.160 --> 1:07:57.200]  Iraq War in 9-11.
[1:07:57.200 --> 1:08:01.960]  These were all things that were planned out, if not the specifics of it, the general thrust
[1:08:01.960 --> 1:08:02.960]  of it.
[1:08:02.960 --> 1:08:07.680]  This sort of endless war scenario is something that's been known and our group has known
[1:08:07.680 --> 1:08:09.080]  about for a very long time.
[1:08:09.080 --> 1:08:14.960]  When I first began to brief the director of the CIA, for example, in 1993, Bill Clinton's
[1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:22.000]  first CIA director, Woolsey, he and the president were being denied all information on this.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:27.360]  Now it's going right mainstream into the mainstream government, but what you're going to notice
[1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:32.920]  is that the spend they're putting on it always is that it's a threat to the national security.
[1:08:32.920 --> 1:08:37.360]  Now interestingly, like the videos that some of these you've been showing, those aren't
[1:08:37.360 --> 1:08:42.640]  extraterrestrial alien threats, those are ours, and they're staging these things over
[1:08:42.640 --> 1:08:49.880]  our military bases and over our Navy ships to try to present a specter of a threat.
[1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:52.880]  And this is the classic false flag operation.
[1:08:52.880 --> 1:08:54.080]  And people say, when did it start?
[1:08:54.080 --> 1:08:57.200]  I said it started in the mid-1950s.
[1:08:57.200 --> 1:09:02.880]  I have a document from the CIA director at that time stating explicitly, and this is
[1:09:02.880 --> 1:09:10.640]  in my book, unacknowledged, and the documentary as well, that says that the psychological
[1:09:10.640 --> 1:09:15.560]  warfare value of this subject should be exploited.
[1:09:15.560 --> 1:09:19.720]  And there are a number of attachments that we did not get, but the document makes it
[1:09:19.720 --> 1:09:23.560]  quite clear that this is what they would be doing with the UFO subject.
[1:09:23.560 --> 1:09:29.000]  So unfortunately, the public, through as you pointed out, Hollywood, most of the big media,
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:35.680]  which is all corrupt and embedded into this transnational criminal clandestine organization
[1:09:35.680 --> 1:09:41.040]  known as MAGIC, the Majority Intelligence Committee, a great acronym, MAGIC, because
[1:09:41.040 --> 1:09:45.640]  they do a lot of dark black magic as well, but we won't get into that.
[1:09:45.640 --> 1:09:51.440]  And the Majority Intelligence Committee, those guys have gone through several generations
[1:09:51.440 --> 1:09:56.800]  of people, and there's a lot of conflict in that group now, but there's one cell of it
[1:09:56.800 --> 1:10:01.080]  that are beginning to, quote, leak, which aren't leaks at all, footage like you've
[1:10:01.080 --> 1:10:05.400]  been showing from CNN and news around the world.
[1:10:05.400 --> 1:10:08.600]  And invariably, you'll see that the narrative says, oh, this is a threat to our national
[1:10:08.600 --> 1:10:09.600]  security.
[1:10:09.600 --> 1:10:13.800]  Well, it's kind of absurd because most of the footage they've been showing are footage
[1:10:13.800 --> 1:10:21.840]  of our own clandestine anti-gravity aircraft flying over our own bases, U.S. clandestine
[1:10:21.840 --> 1:10:22.840]  aircraft.
[1:10:22.840 --> 1:10:28.200]  But as high a level as you were, the compartmentalization, 99% of the military doesn't know about this,
[1:10:28.200 --> 1:10:32.040]  and there's, as you said, a breakaway of scientific dictatorship above that.
[1:10:32.040 --> 1:10:34.000]  And we should also know how that recruiting works.
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:38.200]  How did you get, because, I mean, maybe one out of what 10,000 scientists even gets approached,
[1:10:38.200 --> 1:10:41.720]  they approached my dad when he was in high school in plan two, he thought he volunteered
[1:10:41.720 --> 1:10:45.360]  for NASA by the time he became a senior in high school, they called him in and said,
[1:10:45.360 --> 1:10:46.360]  that's not what we're doing.
[1:10:46.360 --> 1:10:50.440]  He didn't like it, so he didn't join the project, but my dad was approached because
[1:10:50.440 --> 1:10:53.040]  he had some of the highest test scores in the country.
[1:10:53.040 --> 1:10:58.120]  Well, you know, I started a project that, the reason I got on the radar, and of course,
[1:10:58.120 --> 1:11:02.400]  I've never worked for the government, I was certainly offered a position.
[1:11:02.400 --> 1:11:06.400]  I know your viewers are going to think that I'm making this up, but I'm not.
[1:11:06.400 --> 1:11:14.160]  In 1992, the head of Army Intelligence, General Albert Stubblebine III, offered me $2 billion
[1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:20.360]  with a B. If I would leave my medical career and join their little group of thugs and
[1:11:20.360 --> 1:11:24.360]  fascists, and I said, no, thank you, he then went to my wife, who your producer's been
[1:11:24.360 --> 1:11:29.200]  dealing with, and tried to convince her to convince me, that is how corrupt this group
[1:11:29.200 --> 1:11:30.200]  is.
[1:11:30.200 --> 1:11:38.120]  Now, why they offered me $2 billion, I think is because I started, if you go to CE5 contact
[1:11:38.120 --> 1:11:42.040]  at your app store, you're going to see we have an app that teaches people how to make
[1:11:42.040 --> 1:11:46.360]  contact with the actual ETs, not the fake ones.
[1:11:46.360 --> 1:11:53.120]  And we began to do that in the early 90s, and in 1992, we successfully vectored onto
[1:11:53.120 --> 1:11:59.240]  a beach near Pensacola, Kraft, very close to us, four of them, and this ended up on
[1:11:59.240 --> 1:12:02.280]  the front page of the Pensacola paper.
[1:12:02.280 --> 1:12:06.120]  And the result of that was that I kicked a hornet's nest, because the next thing you
[1:12:06.120 --> 1:12:11.120]  know, I'm being approached by the head of Army Intelligence and people from the CIA
[1:12:11.120 --> 1:12:16.560]  and National Security Agency trying to get inside and figure out what the hell we're
[1:12:16.560 --> 1:12:22.040]  doing, because basically what I had to come to the conclusion was that the civilizations,
[1:12:22.040 --> 1:12:26.240]  the actual ET civilizations, or people called them alien, I don't use that word because
[1:12:26.240 --> 1:12:31.880]  they think you're talking about some of them from Guatemala, that those civilizations are
[1:12:31.880 --> 1:12:37.720]  very peaceful, but they're extremely concerned about our hostility, and here's what happened
[1:12:37.720 --> 1:12:43.640]  to Alex, when we began to detonate atomic and then nuclear, thermonuclear weapons, those
[1:12:43.640 --> 1:12:49.600]  not only destroy the area over the Earth where they're detonated, those create a scalar,
[1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:55.920]  fast from the speed of light, trans-dimensional pulse that actually damages other worlds and
[1:12:55.920 --> 1:12:56.920]  the superhighways.
[1:12:56.920 --> 1:12:59.120]  Sure, it's blowing holes over the dimensions.
[1:12:59.120 --> 1:13:01.720]  Correct, and it's very dangerous.
[1:13:01.720 --> 1:13:03.720]  And so that's why in the 40s and 50s.
[1:13:03.720 --> 1:13:06.040]  That's all that stuff suddenly showed up as soon as we did it.
[1:13:06.040 --> 1:13:12.040]  Yes, sir, that's exact, and they know that, but instead of being reasonable, the military
[1:13:12.040 --> 1:13:18.040]  industrial complex that became trans-national at the end of World War II, it wasn't just
[1:13:18.040 --> 1:13:19.720]  the United States.
[1:13:19.720 --> 1:13:25.240]  And on this event, on this coming Sunday, we are going to have Senator John Warner,
[1:13:25.240 --> 1:13:30.360]  who is a member of this committee with George Bush Sr. and others, his son, who is also
[1:13:30.360 --> 1:13:36.800]  the grandson of Paul Mellon, who was a fascist, who started the CIA with Alan Dulles on record
[1:13:36.800 --> 1:13:39.280]  talking about his family's involvement on this.
[1:13:39.280 --> 1:13:43.840]  This is an explosive interview, a three-hour interview, we're just going to show some clips
[1:13:43.840 --> 1:13:49.040]  of it, but he admits that his grandfather, Paul Mellon, went over to Germany.
[1:13:49.040 --> 1:13:51.240]  Oh, wow, wow, I wasn't letting others on.
[1:13:51.240 --> 1:13:55.040]  I'm told we have the clips, we'll be right back.
[1:13:55.040 --> 1:14:01.560]  One of the most popular memes on the Internet in the last decade has been, Alex Jones was
[1:14:01.560 --> 1:14:07.960]  right, but it now routinely trends number one on platforms like Twitter and Facebook,
[1:14:07.960 --> 1:14:10.680]  making the globalists pull their hair out in anger.
[1:14:10.680 --> 1:14:14.280]  Well, let me tell you, we are Tomorrow's News today, and thanks for your support.
[1:14:14.280 --> 1:14:18.360]  We're still on air at infowars.com and Band-Aid video from radio stations and TV stations
[1:14:18.360 --> 1:14:19.360]  across the country.
[1:14:19.360 --> 1:14:23.520]  And our film Endgame, censored and taken offline by Amazon when it hit number one a few years
[1:14:23.520 --> 1:14:29.000]  ago, is now available again, we have reprinted it on high quality DVD, in HD, it has a zero
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:33.160]  country code, anyone in the world is authorized to make copies of it, and I'm asking you to
[1:14:33.160 --> 1:14:36.920]  get the original, make copies, give it to everyone you know, air on local access TV,
[1:14:36.920 --> 1:14:40.520]  give it to your pastors, your police chiefs, your state reps, your prime ministers, whatever
[1:14:40.520 --> 1:14:45.200]  you do, warn the world, this film uses their own documents and own statements 14 years
[1:14:45.200 --> 1:14:50.040]  ago to expose them, it's more important than ever, available at infowarsstore.com, that's
[1:14:50.040 --> 1:14:55.960]  infowarsstore.com, Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[1:14:55.960 --> 1:15:01.280]  Every product you hear me on air advertising, we have it stock in our warehouse in Austin,
[1:15:01.280 --> 1:15:03.200]  Texas, every product.
[1:15:03.200 --> 1:15:07.400]  So if you order it, we've got it shipped out in a couple of days, sometimes the same day.
[1:15:07.400 --> 1:15:11.400]  Losers get confused when they hear me talk about the fact that the supply chain's breaking
[1:15:11.400 --> 1:15:18.280]  down and its future orders, its product we're trying to reorder to get back in that we're
[1:15:18.280 --> 1:15:19.280]  having trouble with.
[1:15:19.280 --> 1:15:25.120]  So I'm talking about double, triple, quadruple delivery times, and it's across, not just
[1:15:25.120 --> 1:15:29.240]  the supplement, vitamin, mineral industry, it's across every industry, so the globalists
[1:15:29.240 --> 1:15:33.120]  have successfully devastated the economy.
[1:15:33.120 --> 1:15:37.440]  That's why I'm saying, you need to visit infowarsstore.com today, get high quality supplements while
[1:15:37.440 --> 1:15:42.800]  you still can, and storeable food at infowarsstore.com, because we have it in stock, it's ready
[1:15:42.800 --> 1:15:48.000]  to ship, but with the supply chain breakdowns, prices are going up, availability is going
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:49.800]  down, and it's just crazy.
[1:15:49.800 --> 1:15:57.960]  So please get products while you still can, and support the infowars, infowarsstore.com.
[1:15:57.960 --> 1:16:02.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:16:02.960 --> 1:16:18.400]  All right, folks, now that Stephen Rear is our guest for the rest of the hour, I could
[1:16:18.400 --> 1:16:20.400]  talk to him for 10 hours, I'm going to invite him sometime to come on and do a podcast.
[1:16:20.400 --> 1:16:24.360]  We're doing this commercial free, and the average of those are about 2 million viewers,
[1:16:24.360 --> 1:16:28.080]  so listeners are really excited about the Saturday podcast we've been doing live, or
[1:16:28.080 --> 1:16:29.080]  been taping to air.
[1:16:29.080 --> 1:16:32.680]  Maybe he'll join us in a few Saturdays, because it's a big event coming up on Sunday that
[1:16:32.680 --> 1:16:35.200]  I know I'm going to definitely be paying a lot of attention to.
[1:16:35.200 --> 1:16:39.360]  This is a shorter segment, a couple long segments coming up, but let me ask them selfish questions.
[1:16:39.360 --> 1:16:43.480]  I mean, this all affects us together.
[1:16:43.480 --> 1:16:46.200]  But I've known that the globalists are into the occult.
[1:16:46.200 --> 1:16:49.640]  I've known that NASA was founded by occultists, that's even mainstream news now, back when
[1:16:49.640 --> 1:16:52.760]  I was talking about it 25 years ago, people thought I was crazy, just like when you were
[1:16:52.760 --> 1:16:56.600]  talking about it, now there's major network TV shows about it.
[1:16:56.600 --> 1:17:01.840]  So you're right, a revealing's happening, but from my research to the Illuminati, going
[1:17:01.840 --> 1:17:06.440]  back to Solomon and all this, it's about contacting these other dimensional entities.
[1:17:06.440 --> 1:17:07.840]  That's how they're really communicating with them.
[1:17:07.840 --> 1:17:10.200]  They're not coming from distant star systems.
[1:17:10.200 --> 1:17:12.240]  And whether people believe us or not, the elites do.
[1:17:12.240 --> 1:17:15.840]  And now the former head of Israeli intelligence came out, as you know, last month and said,
[1:17:15.840 --> 1:17:18.560]  we're in contact with them, we're working with them since Eisenhower.
[1:17:18.560 --> 1:17:22.800]  Now whether that's true or not, the big disclosure you predicted is here, but you said there'd
[1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:28.200]  be a false disclosure 20 years ago, and I would listen to you on big national shows,
[1:17:28.200 --> 1:17:31.240]  like Art Bell and then in George Noreen, and I thought this guy sounds credible, but I'm
[1:17:31.240 --> 1:17:34.360]  not going there because all the things he said haven't happened yet.
[1:17:34.360 --> 1:17:35.960]  Now it's happening just as you said it would.
[1:17:35.960 --> 1:17:40.840]  So I want to speak to that, but first I want to ask you, the globalists obviously got their
[1:17:40.840 --> 1:17:45.520]  own systems, their own advanced technology, that's been leaked when I was about seven
[1:17:45.520 --> 1:17:49.480]  years old, we were coming back from our ranch in East Texas, driving back to Dallas where
[1:17:49.480 --> 1:17:53.640]  my grandmother lived, and we were on I-45, but I'll never forget, my dad goes, look
[1:17:53.640 --> 1:17:54.760]  at that.
[1:17:54.760 --> 1:17:59.280]  And three stealth fighters that they didn't roll out for 20 something years, 30 years,
[1:17:59.280 --> 1:18:04.120]  but they were gray and blue camouflage style, not like the black ones, were flying at 200
[1:18:04.120 --> 1:18:05.120]  feet.
[1:18:05.120 --> 1:18:07.680]  I went, those are spaceships, my dad goes, no, those are secret aircraft, those are
[1:18:07.680 --> 1:18:12.760]  coming up in advanced aircraft, but I saw what later, I saw them unveil in 1989 in like,
[1:18:12.760 --> 1:18:17.040]  you know, 1980 or whatever, or I guess 1979.
[1:18:17.040 --> 1:18:22.840]  So that's an example of this, this is a shorter segment, but just big picture here, who are
[1:18:22.840 --> 1:18:23.840]  they communicating with?
[1:18:23.840 --> 1:18:28.400]  Because it seems to me like they're communicating with something bad that's anti-human and that
[1:18:28.400 --> 1:18:32.680]  the globalists have teamed up with something very evil, and it fits into Christian cosmology.
[1:18:32.680 --> 1:18:40.520]  Well, I think that the, what we call these transnational clandestine operations, they're
[1:18:40.520 --> 1:18:46.920]  not contacting extraterrestrials, they're contacting beings often from other dimensions,
[1:18:46.920 --> 1:18:48.880]  and people confuse these two things.
[1:18:48.880 --> 1:18:53.920]  So there are other dimensions that have all kinds of, you know, as Monsignor Balducci
[1:18:53.920 --> 1:18:59.280]  at the Vatican said, he says, look, neither demons nor angels need flying saucers.
[1:18:59.280 --> 1:19:05.160]  So there's, it's complicated because a lot of people are conflating, confusing.
[1:19:05.160 --> 1:19:09.880]  Extraterrestrial intelligence and beings from other star systems, which are quite evolved
[1:19:09.880 --> 1:19:15.400]  and universally not hostile with beings from other dimensions, and, you know, people can
[1:19:15.400 --> 1:19:19.800]  be, you know, I know one of the key people of this group, he and his wife are very involved
[1:19:19.800 --> 1:19:26.520]  in Satan and devil activity, and they publish some crazy newsletter called The Devil's Hammer
[1:19:26.520 --> 1:19:27.520]  and what have you.
[1:19:27.520 --> 1:19:30.640]  So, you know, that's sort of, certainly not my expertise.
[1:19:30.640 --> 1:19:31.640]  I'm dealing more with...
[1:19:31.640 --> 1:19:32.640]  Sure.
[1:19:32.640 --> 1:19:33.640]  You brought up Jack Parsons.
[1:19:33.640 --> 1:19:35.560]  I mean, it's on record, they were Satan worshippers, Aleister Crowley.
[1:19:35.560 --> 1:19:40.000]  So the group running this is into Satanism, and I was asking why.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:45.800]  Well, because they like dark power, it's like, someone once told me that some of the people
[1:19:45.800 --> 1:19:53.640]  on this committee, they very much get a thrill out of torture, death, destruction.
[1:19:53.640 --> 1:19:58.920]  They have this really thickness, and, you know, in medicine, we call these people high-functioning
[1:19:58.920 --> 1:20:01.960]  sociopaths.
[1:20:01.960 --> 1:20:07.000]  And I think that this is a big problem because the very good people, for example, when I've
[1:20:07.000 --> 1:20:11.360]  been at the Pentagon briefing, for example, General Patrick Hughes, who was the head of
[1:20:11.360 --> 1:20:12.760]  the Defense Intelligence Agency...
[1:20:12.760 --> 1:20:15.560]  Oh, listen, I know a lot of the top people like you do.
[1:20:15.560 --> 1:20:17.000]  All of them take this completely serious.
[1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:18.000]  The general public knows.
[1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:19.000]  Oh, yeah, they do.
[1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:20.000]  It's deadly serious, the Pentagon.
[1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:21.280]  Oh, it is.
[1:20:21.280 --> 1:20:25.960]  But the thing is, is that that gentleman wasn't read into or briefed on any of this because
[1:20:25.960 --> 1:20:26.960]  he was a good guy.
[1:20:26.960 --> 1:20:32.920]  It's like, when I was at Lord Hill Norton's home in the United Kingdom, he told his minister
[1:20:32.920 --> 1:20:36.800]  of defense, he was a five-star Admiral, he says, they wouldn't tell me a damn thing about
[1:20:36.800 --> 1:20:37.800]  this.
[1:20:37.800 --> 1:20:38.800]  I said, no.
[1:20:38.800 --> 1:20:43.800]  Because you're not willing to go along with a criminal operation that's international
[1:20:43.800 --> 1:20:50.000]  that is killing the planet and is doing one war, endless war after another, and they're
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:51.000]  planning the big one.
[1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:55.880]  And the big one is what we're exposing on Sunday at this webinar.
[1:20:55.880 --> 1:20:56.880]  It's seriousdisclosure.com.
[1:20:56.880 --> 1:20:58.360]  You can find out about it.
[1:20:58.360 --> 1:21:02.720]  But we're going to have Senator John Warner's son and his interview there.
[1:21:02.720 --> 1:21:06.520]  We're going to have Russian cosmonauts who are going to talk about what has happened
[1:21:06.520 --> 1:21:07.520]  in their country.
[1:21:07.520 --> 1:21:08.520]  Let me ask you this.
[1:21:08.520 --> 1:21:09.520]  I've probably met with astronauts.
[1:21:09.520 --> 1:21:12.520]  They told me similar things, one of them said it on air, and we'll talk about that
[1:21:12.520 --> 1:21:15.680]  next segment, but big picture then.
[1:21:15.680 --> 1:21:19.360]  What's the timetable for them to do the big fake ET landing?
[1:21:19.360 --> 1:21:20.960]  How do you see that unfolding?
[1:21:20.960 --> 1:21:25.480]  Actually, the psychological warfare for that began in the 50s.
[1:21:25.480 --> 1:21:31.000]  Many of the events that people know about, like the Cash Landrum affair that happened
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:38.360]  down there in your state in Texas, that was in reality us test flying an ET craft that
[1:21:38.360 --> 1:21:42.320]  went bad that then sprayed radiation on all the people below there.
[1:21:42.320 --> 1:21:44.280]  Look up to Cash Landrum case.
[1:21:44.280 --> 1:21:47.400]  We're going to have testimony from an Air Force officer.
[1:21:47.400 --> 1:21:52.520]  This Air Force officer was the primary investigator of this accident and said, no, we were piloting
[1:21:52.520 --> 1:21:59.240]  that with a man-made plutonium power plant, but it was an ET shell, the infrastructure,
[1:21:59.240 --> 1:22:02.440]  the superstructure, I should say, of the craft.
[1:22:02.440 --> 1:22:04.720]  These things have been going on for decades.
[1:22:04.720 --> 1:22:09.960]  They get thrown to people as if they were some alien event, and they're glad for the
[1:22:09.960 --> 1:22:11.560]  public to do that.
[1:22:11.560 --> 1:22:16.560]  The big one that's coming, we're seeing unfurl before our very eyes in the mainstream news
[1:22:16.560 --> 1:22:23.600]  media where every few days the Pentagon is, quote, leaking or confirming some harassment
[1:22:23.600 --> 1:22:25.760]  of our Navy vessels and what have you.
[1:22:25.760 --> 1:22:28.480]  You notice the language is always threatening.
[1:22:28.480 --> 1:22:34.360]  As one of them recently said, one of the people who's a disinformation agent, Luis Elizondo,
[1:22:34.360 --> 1:22:39.960]  said to our attorney, Daniel Sheehan, he said, point blank, he says, the only way we can get
[1:22:39.960 --> 1:22:43.080]  more money is to present this as a threat.
[1:22:43.080 --> 1:22:45.880]  This is all about a power and money grab.
[1:22:45.880 --> 1:22:50.960]  If civilizations that advanced were actually a threat, it would have been all over, Alex,
[1:22:50.960 --> 1:22:55.400]  with the day we detonated that first atomic bomb and it ripped a hole in space-time that
[1:22:55.400 --> 1:23:00.560]  went into other dimensions, including other planetary systems, faster than the speed of
[1:23:00.560 --> 1:23:01.560]  light.
[1:23:01.560 --> 1:23:08.040]  I think people need to understand that the public, by being brainwashed, and you mentioned
[1:23:08.040 --> 1:23:13.480]  this whole COVID situation, I'm a medical doctor, emergency doctor.
[1:23:13.480 --> 1:23:17.240]  Some of the things that are being done are really not for public health reasons.
[1:23:17.240 --> 1:23:22.800]  They are to control the masses and to beta test their control system over the masses,
[1:23:22.800 --> 1:23:25.040]  but that's a warm-up to what's coming.
[1:23:25.040 --> 1:23:29.040]  We're like Paul Revere here, when we said the British are coming.
[1:23:29.040 --> 1:23:30.360]  We're trying to warn people.
[1:23:30.360 --> 1:23:35.680]  We're cosmic Paul Revere's, you and me, where we're trying to say, look, there's this hoax
[1:23:35.680 --> 1:23:41.280]  cosmic threat that they have been planning for 75 years and now they're starting to unfurl
[1:23:41.280 --> 1:23:42.280]  it.
[1:23:42.280 --> 1:23:43.280]  Here's how we stop it.
[1:23:43.280 --> 1:23:48.720]  Let me explain how we're going to stop this, expose it, because what we're going to do,
[1:23:48.720 --> 1:23:52.840]  and this is going to be turned into a documentary, we're going to do an emergency release on
[1:23:52.840 --> 1:23:56.320]  a documentary, no commercial distribution.
[1:23:56.320 --> 1:24:00.280]  Everyone will be able to put it on their sites, including yours for free, and it's called
[1:24:00.280 --> 1:24:07.200]  the cosmic hoax, and it will actually show the technologies, the actual schematics of
[1:24:07.200 --> 1:24:11.560]  the man-man anti-gravity craft, the events that they have hoax and what they're planning
[1:24:11.560 --> 1:24:12.560]  to do.
[1:24:12.560 --> 1:24:17.560]  Because if we can get a billion people throughout the world to see that, it will stop them from
[1:24:17.560 --> 1:24:18.560]  doing it.
[1:24:18.560 --> 1:24:19.560]  Why?
[1:24:19.560 --> 1:24:23.200]  Because we will expose their dirty little trick in advance, and Alex, as you know, an
[1:24:23.200 --> 1:24:26.560]  ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
[1:24:26.560 --> 1:24:31.520]  If we can prove and show it to the public, this is what they're trying to do, the public
[1:24:31.520 --> 1:24:33.920]  won't be fooled the way they were on 9-11, right?
[1:24:33.920 --> 1:24:34.920]  All right.
[1:24:34.920 --> 1:24:35.920]  I understand.
[1:24:35.920 --> 1:24:36.920]  We're going to stay right there.
[1:24:36.920 --> 1:24:40.960]  We're going to come back and talk about how we can deal with this, because there's no
[1:24:40.960 --> 1:24:44.320]  doubt what he said 20 years ago is coming true, and there's a lot of documents to back
[1:24:44.320 --> 1:24:45.320]  it up.
[1:24:45.320 --> 1:24:49.080]  He had the former Israeli intelligence come out and say this just a month ago, we'll be
[1:24:49.080 --> 1:24:54.080]  right back.
[1:24:54.080 --> 1:24:58.240]  The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to
[1:24:58.240 --> 1:25:03.520]  redistribute wealth, create a planetary universal income, which of course the United Nations
[1:25:03.520 --> 1:25:07.240]  and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone, and finally a chip
[1:25:07.240 --> 1:25:08.240]  under your skin.
[1:25:08.240 --> 1:25:14.080]  It's all now completely official, part of the UN Great Reset of the Davos Group and
[1:25:14.080 --> 1:25:18.840]  Klaus Schwab, all officially written about it, hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller
[1:25:18.840 --> 1:25:22.800]  Foundation, all the rest of them, a 10 to 21, a 10 to 30, it's here.
[1:25:22.800 --> 1:25:27.720]  It only gets worse like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject
[1:25:27.720 --> 1:25:28.720]  it all.
[1:25:28.720 --> 1:25:34.360]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's a spiritual battle of the first civil and
[1:25:34.360 --> 1:25:36.320]  stopping abortion.
[1:25:36.320 --> 1:25:38.480]  We must start valuing human life again.
[1:25:38.480 --> 1:25:45.560]  We must start saying that we are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential.
[1:25:45.560 --> 1:25:48.120]  Until we do that, we are all slaves.
[1:25:48.120 --> 1:25:55.160]  We must stand up and declare our basic God-given human rights now.
[1:25:55.160 --> 1:25:59.480]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point, it's very bittersweet.
[1:25:59.480 --> 1:26:02.640]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would, and now we have
[1:26:02.640 --> 1:26:05.440]  a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that, I care about beating the new world
[1:26:05.440 --> 1:26:06.440]  order.
[1:26:06.440 --> 1:26:11.200]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[1:26:11.200 --> 1:26:14.400]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us, for a lot of reasons
[1:26:14.400 --> 1:26:18.040]  I can't tell you what's going on, but let's just say this, we're going to see this through
[1:26:18.040 --> 1:26:21.680]  to the end, we're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[1:26:21.680 --> 1:26:25.320]  So please pray for us, and please buy the products, and then FullWareStore.com, they're
[1:26:25.320 --> 1:26:27.880]  great products, plus they fund the operation.

[1:26:31.040 --> 1:26:32.040]  Do they fund freedom?
[1:26:32.040 --> 1:26:33.040]  No, a lot of them don't.
[1:26:33.040 --> 1:26:37.720]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice, when the whole world's waking
[1:26:37.720 --> 1:26:39.560]  up and looking for truth.
[1:26:39.560 --> 1:26:41.160]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[1:26:41.160 --> 1:26:44.600]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[1:26:44.600 --> 1:26:48.080]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[1:26:48.080 --> 1:26:51.520]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're
[1:26:51.520 --> 1:26:55.320]  going to be on the air, and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[1:26:55.320 --> 1:26:58.880]  I'm a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person.
[1:26:58.880 --> 1:27:02.920]  And so as bad as things are with the globalist and tagging humanity, with all the terrible
[1:27:02.920 --> 1:27:07.080]  things that are unfolding, I want you to know that a lot of positive things are happening
[1:27:07.080 --> 1:27:08.080]  as well.
[1:27:08.080 --> 1:27:12.280]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things that the Republic doesn't get to see, and
[1:27:12.280 --> 1:27:17.880]  let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress, or even folks in Hollywood
[1:27:17.880 --> 1:27:24.600]  or mainstream media or industry, people are really, really away from the establishment.
[1:27:24.600 --> 1:27:28.760]  They don't want to go along with the globalists, but they're scared, they're looking for leadership.
[1:27:28.760 --> 1:27:31.360]  Well, that's where M4 comes in.

[1:27:45.480 --> 1:27:50.800]  That's our job, so please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire, so we can be
[1:27:50.800 --> 1:27:53.240]  the shock groups in the information war.

[1:29:16.760 --> 1:29:34.960]  All right, I go off the facts, and I couldn't get people to understand the Federal Reserve
[1:29:34.960 --> 1:29:38.480]  was private when I was first born there, 27 years ago now, everybody knows that.
[1:29:38.480 --> 1:29:42.360]  And I go off the science, I go off the research, and I can tell you, I've been around Hollywood,
[1:29:42.360 --> 1:29:46.440]  I've been around some of the globalists, they're all into the occult.
[1:29:46.440 --> 1:29:48.760]  None of them are atheists.
[1:29:48.760 --> 1:29:51.520]  They believe they're going to become gods and break away with the super science.
[1:29:51.520 --> 1:29:55.400]  They believe their main mission is like Arthur C. Clarke's childhoods end.
[1:29:55.400 --> 1:29:59.800]  They've got to get rid of us to then become this God creature, and even Elon Musk meets
[1:29:59.800 --> 1:30:00.800]  with the globalists.
[1:30:00.800 --> 1:30:03.880]  He's come out and said, I've met with them, they've got a plan to get rid of everybody.
[1:30:03.880 --> 1:30:09.040]  They pray to AI gods, you've seen Bill Joy of Sun Microsystems write articles and give
[1:30:09.040 --> 1:30:12.600]  similar speeches that, you know, hey, does the public know they're planning to get rid
[1:30:12.600 --> 1:30:13.600]  of you?
[1:30:13.600 --> 1:30:18.560]  Dr. Greer, I know you just go off of your own research, who you brief, briefing President
[1:30:18.560 --> 1:30:21.200]  Clinton, seeing him blocked from his investigations.
[1:30:21.200 --> 1:30:25.840]  I've seen the prestigious groups that you've interviewed, guys, keep it on screen.
[1:30:25.840 --> 1:30:30.360]  The retired head of Israeli intelligence basically came out and said that the government's already
[1:30:30.360 --> 1:30:37.920]  in contact with these creatures, former Israeli space chief, says U.S. in contact with Galactic
[1:30:37.920 --> 1:30:41.320]  Federation of Aliens, and Trump knows, that's Fox News.
[1:30:41.320 --> 1:30:45.560]  Now, either he's lying as part of the PSYOP, or it's really going on.
[1:30:45.560 --> 1:30:47.240]  I mean, this is here.
[1:30:47.240 --> 1:30:48.360]  This is ripe.
[1:30:48.360 --> 1:30:52.840]  But then I studied DMT, and I've talked to people, medical doctors that have been to
[1:30:52.840 --> 1:30:57.200]  these things in Costa Rica in places where 30, 40 people take it, they usually do it
[1:30:57.200 --> 1:31:01.280]  at old ritual sites, which I see as like centers where this energy is coming in, and they'll
[1:31:01.280 --> 1:31:03.240]  see all the same thing at the same time.
[1:31:03.240 --> 1:31:07.480]  It's not laser lights, it's not, they're having a group hallucination, or the veils
[1:31:07.480 --> 1:31:08.480]  being left in.
[1:31:08.480 --> 1:31:11.960]  But something's happening when you take that drug in it, and we know the optic nerve is
[1:31:11.960 --> 1:31:14.920]  blocking out a lot of stuff because we couldn't handle seeing all this.
[1:31:14.920 --> 1:31:18.720]  So this is all coming to a head, and as you said, two separate things, or hundreds of
[1:31:18.720 --> 1:31:19.720]  different things.
[1:31:19.720 --> 1:31:24.440]  So your deep understanding of this, try to quantify for folks what's really going on,
[1:31:24.440 --> 1:31:29.440]  because it doesn't seem like, it's there, it's very biblical that some humans have
[1:31:29.440 --> 1:31:33.440]  allied themselves with something that's giving them forbidden knowledge, but only if they
[1:31:33.440 --> 1:31:36.560]  agree to destroy humanity in payment.
[1:31:36.560 --> 1:31:43.400]  Well, I think it's a relatively small number of people who are involved with that way out
[1:31:43.400 --> 1:31:50.480]  lunatic stuff, but what they're very good at doing is deliberately obfuscating and confusing
[1:31:50.480 --> 1:31:51.480]  the picture.
[1:31:51.480 --> 1:31:58.160]  So for example, they will mix in experiences people have had with these beings from other
[1:31:58.160 --> 1:32:01.240]  dimensions and call it alien.
[1:32:01.240 --> 1:32:02.480]  That's why I don't use the word alien.
[1:32:02.480 --> 1:32:07.600]  I use the word extraterrestrial biological entities, civilizations from other planetary
[1:32:07.600 --> 1:32:13.920]  systems, and then I'll talk about interdimensional creatures, and these are two separate things.
[1:32:13.920 --> 1:32:18.760]  Then the reason they deliberately want to conflate them is that because most people aren't going
[1:32:18.760 --> 1:32:24.040]  to understand other dimensions, they can understand, you know, like war of the worlds or independence
[1:32:24.040 --> 1:32:25.280]  day of the movie.
[1:32:25.280 --> 1:32:30.960]  So what they really want to do is control people through fear and endless war, and the
[1:32:30.960 --> 1:32:37.120]  only way to do that is to mix together these various areas of investigation.
[1:32:37.120 --> 1:32:38.120]  And they're scientific.
[1:32:38.120 --> 1:32:41.560]  Now I'm going to say something here that's going to probably blow your listeners' minds.
[1:32:41.560 --> 1:32:46.560]  I've worked with a man who is a senior engineer at the Lockheed Skunk Works in a place called
[1:32:46.560 --> 1:32:52.320]  the Cube under the desert in California, and in that area, they had people hooked up to
[1:32:52.320 --> 1:32:56.160]  electronic devices where they didn't need a drug.
[1:32:56.160 --> 1:33:00.520]  They could do it electronically, where they could tap into these other dimensions, not
[1:33:00.520 --> 1:33:05.720]  extraterrestrials, and bring those monsters into the lab, and they would come into from
[1:33:05.720 --> 1:33:08.600]  one dimension into 3D and be running around.
[1:33:08.600 --> 1:33:12.480]  Now I know this sounds like something like out of Stranger Things, but guess what?
[1:33:12.480 --> 1:33:16.120]  Those guys listen to what I've been saying over the years, and they turn it into these
[1:33:16.120 --> 1:33:22.440]  fictional, you know, silly movies and shows, but the truth is the deliberate confusion
[1:33:22.440 --> 1:33:23.440]  of this.
[1:33:23.440 --> 1:33:25.760]  So you have three things going on, and I'm glad you brought this up.
[1:33:25.760 --> 1:33:28.040]  You have actual extraterrestrial events.
[1:33:28.040 --> 1:33:31.560]  You have interdimensional beings, what you just described.
[1:33:31.560 --> 1:33:38.240]  And then you have the man-made craft, but also the stage craft, because you have intelligence
[1:33:38.240 --> 1:33:44.400]  operations that have used, of course, we have an Intel guy who's on camera, Air Force, who
[1:33:44.400 --> 1:33:48.960]  said, yeah, one of the old days we just used short guys or people had deformities and dressed
[1:33:48.960 --> 1:33:55.240]  them up to be aliens, but now they have what are called program life forms, which are sort
[1:33:55.240 --> 1:34:02.160]  of genetically created creatures with integrated circuits in their cerebral cortex that look
[1:34:02.160 --> 1:34:08.040]  like, yeah, and they look like an alien, and they would fool most people.
[1:34:08.040 --> 1:34:12.120]  I would say most scientists, but the truth is they're not.
[1:34:12.120 --> 1:34:15.920]  They're man-made, but they have been used in abductions and mutilations and things of
[1:34:15.920 --> 1:34:16.920]  this sort.
[1:34:16.920 --> 1:34:18.440]  So you have all this stuff.
[1:34:18.440 --> 1:34:22.080]  Why are they deliberately mushing all this together?
[1:34:22.080 --> 1:34:29.600]  Because it creates the specter of fear, and as Goebbels said, and the guy says, they're
[1:34:29.600 --> 1:34:33.320]  trying to write the new cosmology and set themselves up as the favors.
[1:34:33.320 --> 1:34:34.320]  It makes perfect sense.
[1:34:34.320 --> 1:34:40.400]  Well, yeah, because then people also, remember, people give up their freedom and their power
[1:34:40.400 --> 1:34:43.360]  when they're afraid and they run the big brother.
[1:34:43.360 --> 1:34:48.960]  And so they want to create this sort of global big brother that everyone will bow down to,
[1:34:48.960 --> 1:34:52.880]  and what better way to do it than to have something that they claim is attacking the
[1:34:52.880 --> 1:34:53.880]  entire earth.
[1:34:53.880 --> 1:34:55.360]  Well, remember Henry Kissinger's quote?
[1:34:55.360 --> 1:34:56.360]  He later got asked about it.
[1:34:56.360 --> 1:35:00.760]  He said, no, I made that quote where he said, fear of the unknown, fear of the alien, we'll
[1:35:00.760 --> 1:35:04.760]  use that to take full control, and the world will accept you in occupation.
[1:35:04.760 --> 1:35:05.760]  Correct.
[1:35:05.760 --> 1:35:12.960]  And this is, of course, he was a major architect of these covert programs, and he continues
[1:35:12.960 --> 1:35:16.720]  to have that influence decades later.
[1:35:16.720 --> 1:35:21.280]  And I've been with a number of people on this committee, and it was very interesting when
[1:35:21.280 --> 1:35:26.040]  I was, one of the breaks we're about to talk about Senator John Warner's son, who's around
[1:35:26.040 --> 1:35:31.480]  my age, and he's the grandson of Andrew Mellon, one of the few billionaires that's in the
[1:35:31.480 --> 1:35:32.480]  World War II.
[1:35:32.480 --> 1:35:35.360]  And he says, look, he told me my whole family are fascists, and at the end of the World
[1:35:35.360 --> 1:35:41.520]  War II, and Andrew Mellon, I'm not Andrew, I'm sorry, Paul Mellon, Paul Mellon went over
[1:35:41.520 --> 1:35:47.480]  to Germany and got the Nazi disc and brought it back, it was anti-gravity, it wasn't the
[1:35:47.480 --> 1:35:54.080]  ramjet one, the real one, brought it back with Alan Dulles and General Patton.
[1:35:54.080 --> 1:35:59.040]  General Patton was wanting to bring this out, to bring, you know, relief to humanity, help
[1:35:59.040 --> 1:36:00.500]  rebuild the world.
[1:36:00.500 --> 1:36:05.480]  They killed him in what looked like a traffic accident, a stage, because General Patton
[1:36:05.480 --> 1:36:08.920]  wanted to do the right thing for America and for the planet.
[1:36:08.920 --> 1:36:14.320]  So you have these people who are absolutely fascist, and in terms of occult stuff, if
[1:36:14.320 --> 1:36:21.720]  you look at the tools and what have you way back in the Nazi era, those were all people
[1:36:21.720 --> 1:36:23.580]  who were into the occult.
[1:36:23.580 --> 1:36:29.720]  So there's a dark end to this, now there's a very beautiful end to it, and the actual
[1:36:29.720 --> 1:36:35.880]  interstellar civilizations are more like the beings in the movie Arrival, or a close encounter
[1:36:35.880 --> 1:36:38.040]  to the third time, that movie.
[1:36:38.040 --> 1:36:41.400]  But they don't want the public to know that.
[1:36:41.400 --> 1:36:45.680]  And this is one of my concerns about even Fox News and Tucker Carlson.
[1:36:45.680 --> 1:36:52.440]  He's only had people on there, like Chris Mellon, who is also a Mellon, and Senator
[1:36:52.440 --> 1:36:55.880]  Warner's son, John Warner, before said flat out to me in this interview, you'll see it
[1:36:55.880 --> 1:37:01.400]  on, clips of it on Sunday, when we do this webinar for the 20th anniversary of the Disclosure
[1:37:01.400 --> 1:37:08.000]  Project, and he flat out says that he's furious that a Mellon, a fellow Mellon is lying to
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:12.880]  the American people, because what Chris Mellon is saying is, well, they're a threat to the
[1:37:12.880 --> 1:37:17.080]  national security, and oh, we don't know what they are, and we don't know how these move
[1:37:17.080 --> 1:37:20.400]  faster than the speed of sound without a sonic boom.
[1:37:20.400 --> 1:37:25.400]  And John Warner, the fourth flat out says, that's a lie.
[1:37:25.400 --> 1:37:29.840]  And it's a lie because they want to preserve the element of surprise by not letting your
[1:37:29.840 --> 1:37:35.400]  listeners and the American public know that we already have reverse engineered these E.T.
[1:37:35.400 --> 1:37:38.480]  craft, and we're hoaxing stuff all the time.
[1:37:38.480 --> 1:37:44.000]  Well, what you said 20 years ago, and I listened keenly, you said they're going to start building
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:46.960]  it up, you're going to see the major governments announce it, they're sort of harassing the
[1:37:46.960 --> 1:37:50.440]  military bases, you're going to, it's going to build to a crisis, and then you get into
[1:37:50.440 --> 1:37:51.440]  what happens next.
[1:37:51.440 --> 1:37:55.880]  And so far, you've been dead on, so when we come back, the final segment with Dr. Stephen
[1:37:55.880 --> 1:38:00.360]  Greer, he's going to lay out that if we're unable to expose this, what's going to happen,
[1:38:00.360 --> 1:38:03.560]  what we're going to witness, what we're going to see, and it's just crazy.
[1:38:03.560 --> 1:38:07.640]  Because some of the things he's saying, I personally have run into people that basically
[1:38:07.640 --> 1:38:12.520]  told me the same stuff about these projects, and again, I go back to my dad, and they try
[1:38:12.520 --> 1:38:18.040]  to recruit my dad in high school and college, and then in Dallas, he was a pioneer in implants,
[1:38:18.040 --> 1:38:21.920]  just for dental stuff, and they approached a bunch of the top implant people, so we want
[1:38:21.920 --> 1:38:24.400]  you to move to Maryland, you're going to be in an underground base, two months on, one
[1:38:24.400 --> 1:38:28.080]  month off, we'll pay all this money, it's classified, but it deals with implants and
[1:38:28.080 --> 1:38:29.080]  cyborgs.
[1:38:29.080 --> 1:38:33.640]  So that's industrial level, that's how many professionals they're recruiting, and he
[1:38:33.640 --> 1:38:34.640]  didn't even take that job.
[1:38:34.640 --> 1:38:38.320]  So that's just, that's just with my dad, those two brushes with this, and then of course
[1:38:38.320 --> 1:38:42.120]  all the things I've experienced, not the Globals have tried that, the Kissinger group, in front
[1:38:42.120 --> 1:38:44.640]  of my producer tried to hire me and said, join the New World Order.
[1:38:44.640 --> 1:38:50.240]  So, I mean, I know how real this is, folks, we'll be right back, infowars.com, tomorrow's
[1:38:50.240 --> 1:38:51.240]  news today.

[1:39:45.480 --> 1:39:54.080]  Welcome to InfowarsStore.com today.
[1:39:54.080 --> 1:39:57.440]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[1:39:57.440 --> 1:40:01.760]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[1:40:01.760 --> 1:40:06.480]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[1:40:06.480 --> 1:40:11.000]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com.
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:15.840]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[1:40:15.840 --> 1:40:21.560]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide
[1:40:21.560 --> 1:40:27.560]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[1:40:27.560 --> 1:40:34.200]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[1:40:34.200 --> 1:40:38.800]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[1:40:38.800 --> 1:40:44.760]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[1:40:44.760 --> 1:40:47.400]  facts that pertain to reality.
[1:40:47.400 --> 1:40:54.960]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:40:54.960 --> 1:40:58.600]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[1:40:58.600 --> 1:41:02.600]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to
[1:41:02.600 --> 1:41:03.600]  pass.
[1:41:03.600 --> 1:41:07.000]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:11.160]  a point where all the training is just beta, and you go into the point of being cold, being
[1:41:11.160 --> 1:41:12.160]  totally enslaved.
[1:41:12.160 --> 1:41:15.960]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making
[1:41:15.960 --> 1:41:16.960]  that move.
[1:41:16.960 --> 1:41:20.960]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with
[1:41:20.960 --> 1:41:26.640]  the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis,
[1:41:26.640 --> 1:41:31.560]  under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that
[1:41:31.560 --> 1:41:37.240]  they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate
[1:41:37.240 --> 1:41:41.840]  change, as the UN and Klaus Schwabber is saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the
[1:41:41.840 --> 1:41:47.840]  year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't
[1:41:47.840 --> 1:41:50.800]  get more IMF and World Bank money.
[1:41:50.800 --> 1:41:54.960]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[1:41:54.960 --> 1:42:01.440]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[1:42:01.440 --> 1:42:05.960]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:42:05.960 --> 1:42:08.440]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[1:42:08.440 --> 1:42:12.080]  Could their objective be world domination?
[1:42:12.080 --> 1:42:15.360]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:42:15.360 --> 1:42:21.320]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[1:42:21.320 --> 1:42:23.520]  of humanity is at hand.
[1:42:23.520 --> 1:42:26.160]  The globalist fear this film made 14 years ago.
[1:42:26.160 --> 1:42:28.400]  It is the blueprint for their plan to figure out the world.
[1:42:28.400 --> 1:42:29.840]  It is the blueprint for the great reset.
[1:42:29.840 --> 1:42:30.840]  It is in-game.
[1:42:30.840 --> 1:42:35.400]  Blueprint for global enslavement, available right now at infowarstore.com with a zero country
[1:42:35.400 --> 1:42:38.040]  code meaning you can make copies of it anywhere in the world.
[1:42:38.040 --> 1:42:42.240]  I strongly suggest you get the film in-game at infowarstore.com.
[1:42:42.240 --> 1:42:46.520]  I strongly suggest you make copies and share it, and if you take that action, I demand
[1:42:46.520 --> 1:42:50.040]  you tell others that you've given a copy too, that they make copies and share it as well.
[1:42:50.040 --> 1:42:58.240]  That will trigger distribution by proxy meaning we the people cannot be stopped.
[1:42:58.240 --> 1:43:24.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:43:24.240 --> 1:43:34.840]  It's great to do an hour and a half commercial free podcast every Saturday now that's so
[1:43:34.840 --> 1:43:38.720]  popular that we post a band on video, so that's coming up in the next three, four weeks.
[1:43:38.720 --> 1:43:42.160]  Look forward to having him on commercial free, so we have a lot more time to talk and not
[1:43:42.160 --> 1:43:43.160]  be interrupted.
[1:43:43.160 --> 1:43:46.840]  But here's the Fox News article, and it was also in her wits and Jerusalem post.
[1:43:46.840 --> 1:43:51.280]  Former Israeli space chief, who's also intelligent head, says U.S. in contact with the Galactic
[1:43:51.280 --> 1:43:53.480]  Federation of Aliens and Trump knows.
[1:43:53.480 --> 1:43:54.480]  He's very well spoken.
[1:43:54.480 --> 1:43:55.480]  He's not seen all.
[1:43:55.480 --> 1:44:00.840]  As Shed told Israel's Yedot newspaper, the humanity's not ready for the public disclosure
[1:44:00.840 --> 1:44:05.600]  of extraterrestrials, who he claims currently are in talks with government agencies on our
[1:44:05.600 --> 1:44:06.600]  planet.
[1:44:06.600 --> 1:44:09.640]  There's an agreement between the U.S. government and the aliens.
[1:44:09.640 --> 1:44:14.160]  They signed a contract with us to do experiments here.
[1:44:14.160 --> 1:44:18.960]  From what you know, Dr. Greer, is this to more disinfo, is this part of the plan build
[1:44:18.960 --> 1:44:19.960]  this up?
[1:44:19.960 --> 1:44:23.560]  They're saying they're a threat, but in all the propaganda, we see they are saying they're
[1:44:23.560 --> 1:44:24.560]  a threat.
[1:44:24.560 --> 1:44:25.560]  So what's going on here?
[1:44:25.560 --> 1:44:26.560]  It's both.
[1:44:26.560 --> 1:44:31.800]  Now, remember when someone like this leaks or says something, that's been cleared and
[1:44:31.800 --> 1:44:36.040]  it has one part truth and then another part that's not.
[1:44:36.040 --> 1:44:42.240]  And that's the way you get disinformation out to brainwash the public is that you always
[1:44:42.240 --> 1:44:45.680]  include some of it has to be true.
[1:44:45.680 --> 1:44:49.120]  So what part of it is true?
[1:44:49.120 --> 1:44:56.160]  Eisenhower did have meeting with extraterrestrials near New York, California in 1956.
[1:44:56.160 --> 1:45:02.560]  I have the French intelligence service gave me documents about that when I was doing things
[1:45:02.560 --> 1:45:06.640]  with President Sarkozy and his Ministry of Defense a few years ago.
[1:45:06.640 --> 1:45:14.320]  Now, what happened and it's more complex, Eisenhower wanted to do something that would
[1:45:14.320 --> 1:45:19.600]  be a peaceful contact with these civilizations and roll down the Cold War that was starting
[1:45:19.600 --> 1:45:24.640]  up because he was wearied out by World War II and wanted the world to be peaceful.
[1:45:24.640 --> 1:45:28.560]  And also, there were some wondrous technologies that would benefit all of humanity.
[1:45:28.560 --> 1:45:32.040]  I mean, all this stuff about global warming and pollution.
[1:45:32.040 --> 1:45:36.000]  Yeah, the world's polluted, it's a cesspool, but it doesn't have to be.
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:37.320]  So that could have happened.
[1:45:37.320 --> 1:45:38.320]  Here's what happened.
[1:45:38.320 --> 1:45:45.000]  Instead, people like Paul Mellon and Alan Dulles and people at the CIA who were tied
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:53.120]  into these global clandestine organizations, they stopped Eisenhower and Eisenhower died
[1:45:53.120 --> 1:45:56.960]  a very bitter, sad man about this issue.
[1:45:56.960 --> 1:46:00.920]  And that's why he gave that speech when he left office just before Jack Kennedy came
[1:46:00.920 --> 1:46:03.480]  in the wear the military industrial complex.
[1:46:03.480 --> 1:46:05.640]  I mean, this is a five star general saying that.
[1:46:05.640 --> 1:46:09.640]  So yes, they never played the full speech, 21 minute farewell to the rest.
[1:46:09.640 --> 1:46:13.720]  He says there's a technological elite in control of this that's taking over.
[1:46:13.720 --> 1:46:14.880]  Yes, correct.
[1:46:14.880 --> 1:46:19.560]  And that had already happened to him because I've interviewed people who worked with Eisenhower,
[1:46:19.560 --> 1:46:21.440]  who said he was basically pushed out.
[1:46:21.440 --> 1:46:23.400]  Now, why did that happen?
[1:46:23.400 --> 1:46:25.160]  Because they didn't want peace.
[1:46:25.160 --> 1:46:27.000]  They want endless war.
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:32.960]  And so some of what the general in Israel said is true, but the implication that there's
[1:46:32.960 --> 1:46:37.520]  some kind of ongoing cooperation is not.
[1:46:37.520 --> 1:46:42.880]  And it's because the extraterrestrial civilizations, they are not wanting to go along with something
[1:46:42.880 --> 1:46:48.760]  where we're going to be putting endless weapons into space and having interplanetary conflict.
[1:46:48.760 --> 1:46:51.640]  And let me say something else about the technology.
[1:46:51.640 --> 1:46:54.840]  Everyone has heard of mutual assured destruction mad.
[1:46:54.840 --> 1:46:58.640]  If we had a nuclear war, it would end all life on earth full stop.
[1:46:58.640 --> 1:47:04.200]  If you were to engage the technologies that allow for interstellar travel, which is a thousand
[1:47:04.200 --> 1:47:12.080]  times more powerful than a hydrogen bomb into an exchange of warfare, it would be over writ
[1:47:12.080 --> 1:47:14.080]  large in a nanosecond.
[1:47:14.080 --> 1:47:18.480]  The entire earth would be cut in half and would become rubbish out in space.
[1:47:18.480 --> 1:47:23.400]  So the idea that we're going to have this space war is ridiculous.
[1:47:23.400 --> 1:47:29.040]  Now, unfortunately, I was involved in providing briefing materials to President Trump and
[1:47:29.040 --> 1:47:30.040]  Pence.
[1:47:30.040 --> 1:47:31.040]  I'll say that now publicly.
[1:47:31.040 --> 1:47:32.200]  They're out of office.
[1:47:32.200 --> 1:47:37.320]  They had been brainwashed by members of this cabal, as Greg Ries called it, that there
[1:47:37.320 --> 1:47:40.200]  was this threat that we needed to fight.
[1:47:40.200 --> 1:47:44.520]  And unfortunately, they were presented with a false narrative.
[1:47:44.520 --> 1:47:45.520]  That's huge news.
[1:47:45.520 --> 1:47:46.520]  Give us more details.
[1:47:46.520 --> 1:47:50.600]  So you briefed directly or through their subordinates, the president, vice president?
[1:47:50.600 --> 1:47:56.720]  Through a very close friend of Mr. Pence's family, and who's also very close friends
[1:47:56.720 --> 1:47:58.720]  with the president and his son.
[1:47:58.720 --> 1:48:01.680]  And so I was providing these materials.
[1:48:01.680 --> 1:48:06.280]  Unfortunately, it was late in the game, then the election, and all that debacle happened.
[1:48:06.280 --> 1:48:12.200]  But what we were trying to do, we learned that he and members of the Senate had been
[1:48:12.200 --> 1:48:20.280]  targeted with disinformation and that it had worked and that they had unfortunately created
[1:48:20.280 --> 1:48:23.920]  a crisis within the administration on this issue.
[1:48:23.920 --> 1:48:28.360]  And I was trying to resolve it when, of course, the election happened and all hell broke loose.
[1:48:28.360 --> 1:48:33.560]  But the reality of it, and I haven't spoken of this, I can prove what I'm saying, by the
[1:48:33.560 --> 1:48:34.560]  way.
[1:48:34.560 --> 1:48:36.040]  We have documents to prove this.
[1:48:36.040 --> 1:48:41.720]  The unfortunate thing is that the president, when you get into the White House, if you're
[1:48:41.720 --> 1:48:43.760]  a governor from Indiana like Mr. Pence or...
[1:48:43.760 --> 1:48:45.760]  Your tone was surrounded, you're departmentalized.
[1:48:45.760 --> 1:48:49.760]  I mean, they admit that they would take executive orders he signed and throw them in the trash.
[1:48:49.760 --> 1:48:50.760]  Yes.
[1:48:50.760 --> 1:48:54.320]  And not only that, but if you're wanting to find out about something, what are they going
[1:48:54.320 --> 1:48:55.320]  to do?
[1:48:55.320 --> 1:49:00.080]  They're going to cherry pick and even make up evidence to move you in the direction they
[1:49:00.080 --> 1:49:01.240]  want you to move in.
[1:49:01.240 --> 1:49:02.240]  Sure.
[1:49:02.240 --> 1:49:03.240]  That's why you didn't believe the intelligence briefing.
[1:49:03.240 --> 1:49:04.480]  So let me ask you this.
[1:49:04.480 --> 1:49:08.200]  I know you're looking at this ballpark, dead reckoning it, but clearly they're building
[1:49:08.200 --> 1:49:09.200]  up towards something big.
[1:49:09.200 --> 1:49:13.240]  Any time frame, where will they have the aliens, the fake aliens land?
[1:49:13.240 --> 1:49:14.240]  Will they have them attack?
[1:49:14.240 --> 1:49:17.360]  I mean, because all the Hollywood is always they attack, attack, and clearly that's where
[1:49:17.360 --> 1:49:18.360]  this is going.
[1:49:18.360 --> 1:49:22.400]  Yeah, there's a new Apple TV series or show about this.
[1:49:22.400 --> 1:49:27.520]  It's going to be sort of a redux of like Independence Day sort of nonsense.
[1:49:27.520 --> 1:49:31.560]  My understanding is that that could have happened quite a number of years ago, but there are
[1:49:31.560 --> 1:49:36.200]  people like myself and my group that have been running interference on it.
[1:49:36.200 --> 1:49:39.040]  And there's some people very angry with us about this.
[1:49:39.040 --> 1:49:44.760]  The way we're going to stop it, if we can, is to get billion people or two billion people
[1:49:44.760 --> 1:49:51.240]  to understand the actual technologies humans have that would enable them to hoax this.
[1:49:51.240 --> 1:49:56.600]  Because right now, if you go to Fox News, no one on that network is allowed to say the
[1:49:56.600 --> 1:49:57.600]  Lockheed and Martin.
[1:49:57.600 --> 1:49:58.600]  Oh, I know.
[1:49:58.600 --> 1:50:02.280]  When I talk to really smart people, Lockheed, Martin, Mia Skunkworks, when I talk to them,
[1:50:02.280 --> 1:50:06.040]  they think it's more crazy that the Pentagon has advanced technology that they even have
[1:50:06.040 --> 1:50:08.480]  admitted they have versus aliens.
[1:50:08.480 --> 1:50:13.080]  They think it's more likely it's aliens when it's obviously taking off, flying around.
[1:50:13.080 --> 1:50:17.800]  I mean, people thought that Elon Musk's satellites were aliens, even though he told them that
[1:50:17.800 --> 1:50:19.280]  he was launching a bunch of satellites.
[1:50:19.280 --> 1:50:21.320]  And what do you think of Elon Musk?
[1:50:21.320 --> 1:50:26.000]  Well, you know, unfortunately, I think he's not going to bite the hand that feeds him
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:30.120]  at this point because he's getting so much money for SpaceX.
[1:50:30.120 --> 1:50:32.520]  There are big financial interests behind that.
[1:50:32.520 --> 1:50:35.480]  And as you know, the Tesla car is not a Tesla.
[1:50:35.480 --> 1:50:40.200]  His Tesla Motor Company, if it was a true Tesla, would not have to be plugged into the
[1:50:40.200 --> 1:50:41.400]  coal-fired grid.
[1:50:41.400 --> 1:50:43.760]  It would be pulling energy out of the zero point energy field.
[1:50:43.760 --> 1:50:46.000]  Sir, I'm just saying from your sources, there's different arms of this thing.
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:48.440]  Is he a good guy or a bad guy?
[1:50:48.440 --> 1:50:55.920]  I think he's sort of in the middle trying to get power and move up the chain.
[1:50:55.920 --> 1:50:57.000]  That's how I would see that.
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:50:59.240]  Yeah, that's how I see it as well.
[1:50:59.240 --> 1:51:03.280]  And even look, when I was talking about Senator John Warner, you know, he was a conservative
[1:51:03.280 --> 1:51:06.360]  Republican from my state here in Virginia.
[1:51:06.360 --> 1:51:09.100]  He was a very low-level person who was read into this.
[1:51:09.100 --> 1:51:11.840]  He was not involved in the criminal activities.
[1:51:11.840 --> 1:51:15.760]  So you know, people have to understand the compartmentalization, and there's a rank and
[1:51:15.760 --> 1:51:23.760]  file in order of these covert operations which are called unacknowledged special access projects.
[1:51:23.760 --> 1:51:28.320]  That's why we did the documentary, Unacknowledged, that's had 650 million people around the world
[1:51:28.320 --> 1:51:29.680]  see it, by the way.
[1:51:29.680 --> 1:51:34.760]  So I think what we're trying to do is, you know, put this together in a way the public
[1:51:34.760 --> 1:51:36.680]  can also take an action path.
[1:51:36.680 --> 1:51:41.560]  So when we create this documentary, we're going to release it to the public open source,
[1:51:41.560 --> 1:51:43.160]  basically, to use it in all of you.
[1:51:43.160 --> 1:51:44.160]  Well, that's beautiful.
[1:51:44.160 --> 1:51:45.160]  Listen, we're almost out of time.
[1:51:45.160 --> 1:51:48.200]  And by the way, I've seen, you're not exaggerating, I've seen your films up there with like on
[1:51:48.200 --> 1:51:53.080]  one platform, 190 million views, just one of your films, I guess on YouTube I saw a year
[1:51:53.080 --> 1:51:54.080]  ago or so.
[1:51:54.080 --> 1:51:57.200]  You're seeing that one film total platforms, 600 plus million.
[1:51:57.200 --> 1:51:59.960]  That's got to be the biggest online film ever.
[1:51:59.960 --> 1:52:00.960]  Yes, it is.
[1:52:00.960 --> 1:52:04.960]  And a lot of others were black sites because, you know, we had a film distributor's commercial.
[1:52:04.960 --> 1:52:07.000]  Frankly, I'm a retired doctor.
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:09.240]  I don't really grab a rat's ass about money.
[1:52:09.240 --> 1:52:10.680]  I care about getting the truth out.
[1:52:10.680 --> 1:52:14.400]  Look, my wife and I are going to have our 42nd anniversary in August and I'm expecting
[1:52:14.400 --> 1:52:15.680]  my 11th grandchild.
[1:52:15.680 --> 1:52:18.480]  I want to see a beautiful planet left for them, right?
[1:52:18.480 --> 1:52:20.000]  I know that's what you want to.
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:21.000]  Yes.
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  Yeah.
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:24.360]  All right, tell us one more time about the special Sunday event because I want to watch
[1:52:24.360 --> 1:52:25.360]  that as well.
[1:52:25.360 --> 1:52:26.360]  Yeah.
[1:52:26.360 --> 1:52:31.560]  So you can go to SiriusDisclosure.com, S-I-R-I-U-S Disclosure.com and it's going to be a five
[1:52:31.560 --> 1:52:37.080]  hour webinar with Werner von Braun spokesperson, myself, we're going to have Russian generals
[1:52:37.080 --> 1:52:43.480]  and cosmonauts confirming that the extraterrestrials are here, but they're not hostile and confirming
[1:52:43.480 --> 1:52:44.480]  the danger.
[1:52:44.480 --> 1:52:47.000]  By the way, a bunch of the astronauts at the moon, I mean, they reported they were being
[1:52:47.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  followed.
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:49.000]  Oh, yes, of course.
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:50.000]  Yeah.
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:55.000]  And of course, I think you know, my uncle worked on designing the lunar module that landed
[1:52:55.000 --> 1:52:58.640]  on the moon in 1969 with, you know, his, he worked for Northrop Grumman.
[1:52:58.640 --> 1:53:00.120]  Oh, it was a Grumman back then.
[1:53:00.120 --> 1:53:02.880]  My buddy died, he was talking about this on a longer show, my buddy died a few years ago,
[1:53:02.880 --> 1:53:07.200]  but he's on the famous Apollo program, you mission one, he had two backups, he's the
[1:53:07.200 --> 1:53:10.080]  main guy running the radio and the TV cameras on the moon.
[1:53:10.080 --> 1:53:12.800]  He said, oh, undoubtedly there was stuff up there following around, but they'd have guys
[1:53:12.800 --> 1:53:14.360]  come in and say, don't talk about that.
[1:53:14.360 --> 1:53:16.160]  There's definitely stuff going on out there.
[1:53:16.160 --> 1:53:19.480]  All right, Dr. Greer, thank you so much for the time, sir.
[1:53:19.480 --> 1:53:20.480]  Thank you.
[1:53:20.480 --> 1:53:21.480]  Look forward to seeing you again.
[1:53:21.480 --> 1:53:22.480]  Thank you.
[1:53:22.480 --> 1:53:25.680]  Folks, the film is available on DVD again, they've been suppressing it, it's been banned off
[1:53:25.680 --> 1:53:30.320]  Amazon, in-game blubber for global enlightenment, we're selling them as well as 3.95 a piece,
[1:53:30.320 --> 1:53:35.520]  you can give them to folks at m4warstore.com and it deals with the whole globalist depopulation
[1:53:35.520 --> 1:53:36.520]  program.
[1:53:36.520 --> 1:53:39.520]  All right, you've got more on this at the Stewart Rhoads in studio.
[1:53:39.520 --> 1:53:43.880]  Coming up, stay with us hour number three.
[1:53:43.880 --> 1:53:49.240]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021 and I just want to say something.
[1:53:49.240 --> 1:53:53.600]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over
[1:53:53.600 --> 1:53:57.920]  the years and it's truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed and thankful for all of
[1:53:57.920 --> 1:53:58.920]  you, the listeners of this show.
[1:53:58.920 --> 1:54:02.080]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[1:54:02.080 --> 1:54:05.480]  Whether you are old, whether you are spanned in quite black, it doesn't matter, you've
[1:54:05.480 --> 1:54:06.480]  got red blood.
[1:54:06.480 --> 1:54:11.400]  And if you love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers
[1:54:11.400 --> 1:54:15.880]  and sisters together and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over
[1:54:15.880 --> 1:54:16.880]  the years.
[1:54:16.880 --> 1:54:20.280]  And as crazy as your things are, I want to keep working into the future.
[1:54:20.280 --> 1:54:23.800]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[1:54:23.800 --> 1:54:28.840]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[1:54:28.840 --> 1:54:31.200]  Again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[1:54:31.200 --> 1:54:34.800]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've
[1:54:34.800 --> 1:54:40.320]  done and just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you and hopefully
[1:54:40.320 --> 1:54:42.760]  God will touch your heart to continue to support Him for worse.
[1:54:42.760 --> 1:54:45.120]  God bless.
[1:54:45.120 --> 1:54:49.440]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[1:54:49.440 --> 1:54:54.120]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems including
[1:54:54.120 --> 1:54:59.240]  weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration and even a weakened immune
[1:54:59.240 --> 1:55:00.240]  system.

[1:55:48.160 --> 1:56:17.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:56:17.960 --> 1:56:23.560]  It's going through incredible changes, God is real, the devil's real and some will say
[1:56:23.560 --> 1:56:29.160]  what are you doing to have a Stephen Greer on, I think you've made a lot of predictions
[1:56:29.160 --> 1:56:32.960]  that have come through but we should all be having a debate about this because all these
[1:56:32.960 --> 1:56:36.800]  former intelligence heads, all these big government officials are saying this is real and this
[1:56:36.800 --> 1:56:37.800]  is going on.
[1:56:37.800 --> 1:56:43.600]  So it's either a giant hoax they're about to launch or it's real or like Greer says
[1:56:43.600 --> 1:56:49.880]  it's both a hoax and real and the globalists are basically satanic, dialed into really
[1:56:49.880 --> 1:56:56.440]  bad stuff, the devil, the fallen ones and are trying to kill everybody and I just see
[1:56:56.440 --> 1:56:58.080]  this fulfilling the Bible.
[1:56:58.080 --> 1:57:01.200]  Now your little glitterbug preacher down the street, they're going to tell you to have
[1:57:01.200 --> 1:57:05.960]  your QR code and to get in the church and take the vaccine and boy that ain't none of
[1:57:05.960 --> 1:57:09.640]  that in the Bible.
[1:57:09.640 --> 1:57:15.680]  Those are a bunch of globalist trained minions trying to keep people in the dark in my view
[1:57:15.680 --> 1:57:20.400]  and so I think more knowledge, more research is what's needed and if you study any ancient
[1:57:20.400 --> 1:57:26.840]  scripts or look at any medieval drawings or anything, before they could fake UFOs they
[1:57:26.840 --> 1:57:35.840]  were all over the damn place and you read ancient Vikings writings about a craft landing
[1:57:35.840 --> 1:57:40.440]  on little gnomes get off it, it sounds like great aliens, there's some weird crap going
[1:57:40.440 --> 1:57:41.440]  on.
[1:57:41.440 --> 1:57:45.640]  That's all I'm telling you and we should be aware of it, we should talk about it.
[1:57:45.640 --> 1:57:49.720]  I got one segment of other big news I'm going to cover next segment on the rioting and on
[1:57:49.720 --> 1:57:53.720]  the borders and all that stuff we haven't gotten to yet in the Stewart Road above keepers.
[1:57:53.720 --> 1:57:59.600]  It's going to be in studio with us but I want to talk about something that is a 360 win.
[1:57:59.600 --> 1:58:07.520]  It funds our operation, it's something everybody should have just for regular event and protection
[1:58:07.520 --> 1:58:12.960]  in an emergency and that's a satellite phone and I got reached out to by Steve Quayle years
[1:58:12.960 --> 1:58:16.200]  ago and said you ought to have these folks as a sponsor they're great people and I didn't
[1:58:16.200 --> 1:58:19.600]  get around to doing it but I looked it up and it was a great deal they're offering.
[1:58:19.600 --> 1:58:25.240]  It's all apples and oranges but it's one of the best deals out there and people love it.
[1:58:25.240 --> 1:58:28.880]  You get free phone calls on it from everybody that calls you but when you make calls because
[1:58:28.880 --> 1:58:35.320]  it goes over the satellite up to it then you get 150 minutes a month.
[1:58:35.320 --> 1:58:41.000]  So infowarsphone.com, infowarsphone.com this is really triggered the liberals they say
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:44.080]  I'm selling my own cell phone no this is a satellite phone.
[1:58:44.080 --> 1:58:47.000]  It's very real leftist I know you don't understand science.
[1:58:47.000 --> 1:58:51.040]  Cell phones are always cracking and logging everywhere you go and everything you do.
[1:58:51.040 --> 1:58:53.200]  Satellite phones do not have this issue.
[1:58:53.200 --> 1:58:57.560]  Satellite phones work in any extreme location if you can see the sky your phone will work
[1:58:57.560 --> 1:59:00.000]  that antennas too so it will work inside the house.
[1:59:00.000 --> 1:59:06.360]  The Owl Shows special is a free satellite phone and that's like a $600 value for $99.95 per
[1:59:06.360 --> 1:59:11.920]  month with 150 minutes per month no charge receiving calls from other cell phones or
[1:59:11.920 --> 1:59:14.200]  landlines to your satellite phone.
[1:59:14.200 --> 1:59:18.280]  Car antennas and home antennas are available so satellite phones can be used outdoors or
[1:59:18.280 --> 1:59:20.160]  while traveling in your vehicle.
[1:59:20.160 --> 1:59:25.520]  Stay in touch with your loved ones during any national or international emergency that's
[1:59:25.520 --> 1:59:35.720]  infowarsphone.com that's infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1020 941-955-1020 and ask for the
[1:59:35.720 --> 1:59:39.800]  Owl Shows phone special and I'll tell you what else I've been doing.
[1:59:39.800 --> 1:59:45.040]  We're even talking to these folks and others about a cell phone the satellite phone where
[1:59:45.040 --> 1:59:49.600]  you get a subscription it costs money to call but you can listen to the show all the time
[1:59:49.600 --> 1:59:54.760]  on it plug it into a micro FM retransmitter whatever to get around I mean this is important
[1:59:54.760 --> 2:00:00.080]  to have I've got one in my car I've got one in my office everybody should have these this
[2:00:00.080 --> 2:00:05.480]  is something you need a lot of other places you just get the phone and then you buy the
[2:00:05.480 --> 2:00:09.360]  minutes on a card I like to have it all prepaid on there it's all apples and oranges but this
[2:00:09.360 --> 2:00:14.720]  is amongst the best deals out there as the prices have gone down quite a bit this makes
[2:00:14.720 --> 2:00:20.840]  it less prohibited prohibitive for the average person out there so 941-955-1020 and ask for
[2:00:20.840 --> 2:00:27.920]  the Owl Shows special that's info wars phone dot com info wars phone dot com we're really
[2:00:27.920 --> 2:00:31.280]  really glad to have the sponsor and they they love it it's blowing up a lot of you've gotten
[2:00:31.280 --> 2:00:36.280]  the phones you're loving the phones if your truck driver everybody needs this for dead
[2:00:36.280 --> 2:00:40.760]  spots for an emergency it's something everybody should have but on top of it everybody can
[2:00:40.760 --> 2:00:46.840]  call you for free on it it only costs for the 150 minutes a month so check it out satellite
[2:00:46.840 --> 2:00:56.640]  phones with the average person in force phone dot com the equation is very simple the mega
[2:00:56.640 --> 2:01:03.840]  banks control the media they control big pharma they control academia they control the military
[2:01:03.840 --> 2:01:09.680]  industrial complex they control big tech and everywhere that they have been in control
[2:01:09.680 --> 2:01:16.440]  in the third world they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization it is the
[2:01:16.440 --> 2:01:22.400]  western christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights
[2:01:22.400 --> 2:01:27.520]  and so much more that actually threatens them so because they can't defeat that empowering
[2:01:27.520 --> 2:01:34.040]  ethic they instead co-opted turn it upside down and use the idea of equality to actually
[2:01:34.040 --> 2:01:40.320]  destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens their monopoly some control
[2:01:40.320 --> 2:01:45.040]  that's why they target info wars because we understand the key to the feeding of the
[2:01:45.040 --> 2:01:50.640]  only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and that video so redouble
[2:01:50.640 --> 2:02:03.040]  your efforts we're all in this together he aligns himself with the truth and it's time
[2:02:03.040 --> 2:02:29.240]  for you to choose a side you're listening to alex jones welcome back ladies and gentlemen

[2:02:38.040 --> 2:02:44.240]  minutes hit pieces abc news nbc cnn ms nbc i mean i'm walking through restaurants to
[2:02:44.240 --> 2:02:48.800]  see a pile of newspapers laying there and there's stewart rode's right there on the cover i mean
[2:02:48.800 --> 2:02:55.480]  he is the devil well he is going to be joining us in studio for an hour 15 minutes to the
[2:02:55.480 --> 2:03:01.360]  next hour coming up here about 10 minutes from now and we're going to get on offense
[2:03:01.360 --> 2:03:04.640]  today we're going to talk some other being persecuted and we're being persecuted and
[2:03:04.640 --> 2:03:09.200]  obviously the fbis investigating me and everybody and arrested one of my crew members were filming
[2:03:09.200 --> 2:03:14.840]  inside the capital but didn't arrest other folks like national geographic cnn or cnn
[2:03:14.840 --> 2:03:20.160]  that paid $70,000 well $35,000 mbc paid the other i took jay to next was in there saying
[2:03:20.160 --> 2:03:26.280]  burn this mother up or down oh no no no cnn's good financing magic of stewart rode's and
[2:03:26.280 --> 2:03:30.560]  give him somebody $35,000 that ran around the capital saying burn this mother up or down
[2:03:30.560 --> 2:03:35.320]  well he might get a conspiracy charge probably deserves one but because he didn't he'll probably
[2:03:35.320 --> 2:03:40.320]  get in trouble and the guy that called for it all to give him a medal by cnn that's how
[2:03:40.320 --> 2:03:45.560]  this works because they're frauds so we play a few clips here that illustrate this overhead

[2:04:06.760 --> 2:04:11.040]  city they control the mayors they control the city council so they can do a good persecution
[2:04:11.040 --> 2:04:15.400]  there and set the precedent to take control of all other police departments in the country
[2:04:15.400 --> 2:04:19.720]  and george soros has already got all the da's in so they can persecute whoever they want
[2:04:19.720 --> 2:04:25.720]  and terrorize local government until they act as their agents of corruption and then

[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:46.040]  these videos in fact get the clip read history from five years ago about an idea when the
[2:09:46.040 --> 2:09:50.520]  police are defunded and politically correct clip seven the only answer here is you need
[2:09:50.520 --> 2:09:56.240]  to have a gun but in places like chicago and new york and dc you can't have a gun and so
[2:09:56.240 --> 2:10:00.920]  this really happens we're at the mercy of the police who's there trying to defund while
[2:10:00.920 --> 2:10:07.480]  the democrats and all these and the squad have 24 hour a day bodyguards at their houses
[2:10:07.480 --> 2:10:12.240]  taxpayer funded but they don't want us to be able to protect ourselves from black people

[2:10:42.480 --> 2:10:47.240]  as racist trigger happy discriminatory in the event of a violent confrontation so can

[2:12:59.160 --> 2:13:03.400]  public figure and we've given the globalist one hell of a run for their money because

[2:13:20.360 --> 2:13:25.400]  priest class system and i get it me too believe me i'm one of them but it's that relationship

[2:13:56.200 --> 2:14:18.840]  jones show
[2:14:18.840 --> 2:14:23.400]  more than 400 people have now been charged in one of the most complex investigations
[2:14:23.400 --> 2:14:29.560]  the department of justice has ever faced the january 6th attack on the capital the fdi has
[2:14:29.560 --> 2:14:34.880]  called it an act of domestic terrorism and one group has grabbed investigators attention
[2:14:34.880 --> 2:14:41.720]  for their role the oath keepers the fbi describes them as an anti-government militia movement
[2:14:41.720 --> 2:14:46.440]  among them current and former military and law enforcement their name is a reference
[2:14:46.440 --> 2:14:52.360]  to the oath they took to defend the u.s constitution but unlike most other militia groups we learn
[2:14:52.360 --> 2:14:57.760]  the oath keepers haven't been hiding they've been armed and in plain sight broadcasting
[2:14:57.760 --> 2:15:09.800]  plans to mobilize the story will continue in a moment if you were looking for a road
[2:15:09.800 --> 2:15:21.120]  map to january 6th the storm in the capital now all you had to do was listen okay guys
[2:15:21.120 --> 2:15:26.800]  we're on an open channel here now these are the voices of far-right extremists communicating
[2:15:26.800 --> 2:15:32.400]  with each other in real time from homes across america and on the ground in washington's
[2:15:32.400 --> 2:15:39.320]  godspeed and fair winds to us as some of them made their way to the capital trump's been
[2:15:39.320 --> 2:15:44.840]  trying to drain the swamp with a straw we just brought a shop back stop to steal they were
[2:15:44.840 --> 2:15:54.360]  talking on a phone like a walkie-talkie and has an international around 150 so i've known
[2:15:54.360 --> 2:15:59.720]  for i don't know 15 years or so even before he had oath keepers that we work for ron paul
[2:15:59.720 --> 2:16:05.120]  i had him on some should come in here an army veteran a father he's been a lawyer constitutional
[2:16:05.120 --> 2:16:10.200]  lawyer and the founder of oath keepers that for over a decade kept its nose clean in an
[2:16:10.200 --> 2:16:15.480]  almost impossible environment of infiltrators provocateurs you name it oh 60 minutes said
[2:16:15.480 --> 2:16:19.200]  he wouldn't talk to them because he was scared to know it because he knows anything he says
[2:16:19.200 --> 2:16:25.240]  will be twisted against me but here he will speak live today about this attempt to defrain
[2:16:25.240 --> 2:16:30.040]  the american people as all of us are terrorists talk about what a few hundred people did one
[2:16:30.040 --> 2:16:33.880]  guy pooped on the floor a few cops got beat up now they admit that the officer that died
[2:16:33.880 --> 2:16:40.600]  did not die from the battle that day but meanwhile they're saying whoever said demonstrations
[2:16:40.600 --> 2:16:45.600]  have to be peaceful and you're seeing hey let's be violent let's threaten jurors you
[2:16:45.600 --> 2:16:52.480]  have the left that burned down police stations and set fire to courthouses being let off in
[2:16:52.480 --> 2:16:58.280]  seattle and in oregon so you have this backdrop really upsetting the american people you see
[2:16:58.280 --> 2:17:01.880]  a million folks at a trump rally coming out saying we know there's a fraud we know there's
[2:17:01.880 --> 2:17:08.880]  a scam and then we see this frothing this foaming at the mouth to arrest everyone that
[2:17:08.880 --> 2:17:12.800]  was even there not just those that went in the media once it's all arrested so we've
[2:17:12.800 --> 2:17:17.480]  had the fbi arrest one of our reporters who shot video the whole time he didn't hide any
[2:17:17.480 --> 2:17:24.200]  of it he he the police waved him in uh sam montoya uh and uh he shot video inside he
[2:17:24.200 --> 2:17:28.680]  caught actually got it being executed uh by the federal officer whose name they still
[2:17:28.680 --> 2:17:32.520]  try to suppress uh but when a cop shoots somebody else we know about it in five minutes so
[2:17:32.520 --> 2:17:36.120]  he's here with us 15 minutes maybe longer in the next hour because matt rackin i would
[2:17:36.120 --> 2:17:40.320]  love to talk to you enemies farm domestic dot com takes over a little bit into the next
[2:17:40.320 --> 2:17:45.480]  hour but uh steward also don't want to just focus on this but just the country in general
[2:17:45.480 --> 2:17:50.640]  the borders open world government being announced uh i mean we have lived to see it we are in
[2:17:50.640 --> 2:17:54.360]  the globalist takeover election fraud you said it during the break alex we're in a
[2:17:54.360 --> 2:18:01.120]  dictatorship now yeah we're sliding into it can be very clearly seen as a politicized
[2:18:01.120 --> 2:18:07.000]  uh witch hunt where you have two different different societies you have the one where
[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:12.640]  the left is cultivating their own street soldiers to go and destroy the country so you have
[2:18:12.640 --> 2:18:17.960]  an insurrection happening at the very same time you have a police state being imposed
[2:18:17.960 --> 2:18:24.680]  from the top down through the illegitimately installed by the administration and their
[2:18:24.680 --> 2:18:30.440]  attempt to solidify power it's really bizarre to watch in the street it's a once an overthrow
[2:18:30.440 --> 2:18:34.800]  and insurrection that would continue from last year i mean it's not going to stop it's
[2:18:34.800 --> 2:18:38.960]  going to keep getting worse and worse i think this is they're making their move on us absolutely
[2:18:38.960 --> 2:18:45.360]  so they're using both it's a bizarre combination of a communist revolution in the streets and
[2:18:45.360 --> 2:18:49.360]  an oppressive regime that's solidifying power but i think it's pressure from above and below
[2:18:49.360 --> 2:18:54.600]  sure but i think it's good i think the court packing plan i want them to do that i want
[2:18:54.600 --> 2:18:58.560]  them to come for the guns i want to make it very clear to the american people by the way
[2:18:58.560 --> 2:19:02.440]  i've known you a long time you've always been a relaxed guy very zen you seem actually
[2:19:02.440 --> 2:19:07.480]  pleased right now you well what i'm saying is is that you seem very calm for a guy they're
[2:19:07.480 --> 2:19:11.400]  openly saying it's person number one the kingpin they want to put in present i'm not worried
[2:19:11.400 --> 2:19:17.120]  about myself i'm worried about my country and i just recognize this is where we're at
[2:19:17.120 --> 2:19:20.400]  and so i'm going to speak to you you're an american citizen under a far and shy com take
[2:19:20.400 --> 2:19:23.800]  over and you're you're acting accordingly yeah i'm going to speak my my i'm going to speak
[2:19:23.800 --> 2:19:29.800]  true to powers left like to say lisa say so the truth is is that they are concerned and
[2:19:29.800 --> 2:19:35.880]  afraid of the hundred million americans who are still patriots inside the military inside
[2:19:35.880 --> 2:19:41.380]  law enforcement here outside us veterans especially they're worried about all of that and so they're
[2:19:41.380 --> 2:19:45.640]  grasping for and that's what the showbond thing is about a purge of the police absolutely
[2:19:45.640 --> 2:19:50.280]  and a nationalization of the police they're going to purge i think it's um it was your
[2:19:50.280 --> 2:19:56.280]  hernandez that yesterday on uh on on the war room he's right they are now attempting to
[2:19:56.280 --> 2:20:01.880]  demoralize and drive out all the conservatives anybody who's a even if they're considered
[2:20:01.880 --> 2:20:06.160]  leftist but but our sincere patriots try to drive them out of police service the guys
[2:20:06.160 --> 2:20:10.320]  who were dedicated to actually serving the community but when drive them out of police
[2:20:10.320 --> 2:20:15.160]  service they can replace them with their foot soldiers it's the same exact thing the nazis
[2:20:15.160 --> 2:20:19.520]  did and they took over in germany they nationalize the police put them in a control and by the
[2:20:19.520 --> 2:20:23.520]  way the left admits that's the process they're involved in sure well they they want they're
[2:20:23.520 --> 2:20:27.720]  coming out now with papers advocating for a nationalization of the police so what we
[2:20:27.720 --> 2:20:33.640]  have to do is recognizing that is we have to circle around our local police and make
[2:20:33.640 --> 2:20:38.360]  sure i agree with all of the next segment and the word please is not the right word
[2:20:38.360 --> 2:20:41.920]  i just feel like you're in the zone and you're content and you know you're in the right place
[2:20:41.920 --> 2:20:47.680]  well yeah i'm not going to let my enemies affect my mental state and what i know i need
[2:20:47.680 --> 2:20:51.480]  to do and say and so that's what they want they want you they want to crush you that's
[2:20:51.480 --> 2:20:56.680]  what we saw unfortunately a member of both keepers um pulled you out they put the guy
[2:20:56.680 --> 2:21:02.680]  in tonight in bail put him in jail for months gave him the perception that life is over
[2:21:02.680 --> 2:21:06.120]  he's got nothing to live for he has to make a deal that's what they want to do is crush
[2:21:06.120 --> 2:21:09.960]  your spirit just like when the vietnamese would have our our fighter pilots sure same
[2:21:09.960 --> 2:21:13.800]  exact thing so you're all political prisoners this is the big elephant in the room all right
[2:21:13.800 --> 2:21:18.040]  some of the judges starting to pay attention to the lack of evidence and and letting people
[2:21:18.040 --> 2:21:21.560]  out on bond even political said two weeks ago they said there's no evidence on any of
[2:21:21.560 --> 2:21:25.840]  these people like three dudes like three dudes beat up cops well they have no evidence of
[2:21:25.840 --> 2:21:31.160]  a plan to go in and interrupt congress all they have is what we were trying to get congress
[2:21:31.160 --> 2:21:35.800]  to do a 10 day event we didn't want to have it suspended and we were going to win aren't
[2:21:35.800 --> 2:21:40.120]  we had no motive to try to go do this well no it's like roger stone has said himself
[2:21:40.120 --> 2:21:44.040]  it's ridiculous for any chump supporter to advocate trying to interrupt congress on that
[2:21:44.040 --> 2:21:48.920]  day but that's a very reason which is why they weren't trying to do that it was a protest
[2:21:48.920 --> 2:21:52.840]  but the point is is that like any giant crowd crowds have their own brain it went a little
[2:21:52.840 --> 2:21:57.720]  bit a little bit sure and it's it's easy to do it or easy to steer into doing something
[2:21:57.720 --> 2:22:03.200]  so but the big big picture is is that people need to understand that the people who are
[2:22:03.200 --> 2:22:08.720]  being locked up and denied bail it's now 500 trump supporters these are political prisoners
[2:22:08.720 --> 2:22:12.000]  we don't understand that's what's happening to them and we let them stay in their rotting
[2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:16.200]  in jails we sent the president for our own sense right which is why president trump has
[2:22:16.200 --> 2:22:21.520]  got to speak up more he's not doing enough for his own supporters the GOP the trump
[2:22:21.520 --> 2:22:27.840]  supporting GOP he's also speak up fox news he's a speak up for these political prisoners
[2:22:27.840 --> 2:22:30.960]  yeah I mean I was mad that a few hundred people pushed you in and did some stuff that day
[2:22:30.960 --> 2:22:34.480]  but they're not terrorists that they're not the level they claim all the left burns down
[2:22:34.480 --> 2:22:40.360]  federal courthouses and so we need to defend this and reject this and not collapse in fear
[2:22:40.360 --> 2:22:43.520]  to it you know at the time I was pissed I wanted to have the 10-day hearing and wanted to have
[2:22:43.520 --> 2:22:47.520]  trump speak and I didn't like a few idiots messing up what we were doing but but but
[2:22:47.520 --> 2:22:51.920]  but in hindsight we've got to back these folks after I'm not going to sit here and waste
[2:22:51.920 --> 2:22:59.080]  your time or my time and rattle off the successes and for worse is that if you're paying attention
[2:22:59.080 --> 2:23:06.280]  you know we've done together but I'll tell you this the technocrats are really upping
[2:23:06.280 --> 2:23:11.680]  their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media they're trying
[2:23:11.680 --> 2:23:17.360]  to shudder and silence a human resistance so now is the time to understand that everything
[2:23:17.360 --> 2:23:20.760]  we've talked about has been proven accurate everything you warned your friends and family
[2:23:20.760 --> 2:23:26.000]  about it's about to be true so it's now that your credibility is way up the power structures
[2:23:26.000 --> 2:23:33.000]  to silence those of us that they can but it's up to all of us to not let them silence any
[2:23:33.000 --> 2:23:40.320]  of us we have the power but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech we
[2:23:40.320 --> 2:23:45.080]  have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that long dark night doesn't
[2:23:45.080 --> 2:23:55.840]  come so be the polar bears you are epic is one of only a handful of domain registers
[2:23:55.840 --> 2:24:02.080]  that promote free speech and freedom of association and they know that big tech is buying up almost
[2:24:02.080 --> 2:24:06.520]  all the other major companies and engaging in massive censorship and organized crime
[2:24:06.520 --> 2:24:11.280]  racketeering that's why they've been massively expanding their services so whether you have
[2:24:11.280 --> 2:24:15.360]  domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website or want servers or
[2:24:15.360 --> 2:24:22.160]  any other major service they've got it all and they're expanding and if you go to infowarsdomains.com

[2:30:12.640 --> 2:30:17.760]  support us at info warscore dot info warscore dot com we also have in-game blue river global
[2:30:17.760 --> 2:30:22.320]  enslavement as well as 395 apiece the censored film that predicts the great reset everything else
[2:30:22.320 --> 2:30:27.520]  and steward how do folks support oaf keepers and you're in battled organization that's really
[2:30:27.520 --> 2:30:35.200]  done a stalwart job and and and and oh you know they sit on 60 minutes you're not ashamed of yourself
[2:30:35.200 --> 2:30:41.360]  like other militias that are hiding no no no no no you're out the open how dare you yeah we're out
[2:30:41.360 --> 2:30:47.360]  in the open doing 12 disaster relief operations including in down here in houston and port or
[2:30:47.360 --> 2:30:52.800]  rico we were out the open doing security volunteer security at 12 trump rallies out in the open on
[2:30:52.800 --> 2:30:58.400]  the rooftops of furguson stopping arsonist in louisville this last year stopping arsonist so
[2:30:58.400 --> 2:31:02.720]  of course we're in the open that's how we operate we got nothing to hide because we're doing the
[2:31:02.720 --> 2:31:08.800]  right thing so but it is critical now that people support everyone has been detained everyone who's
[2:31:08.800 --> 2:31:14.080]  been denied due process everyone that's being denied bail and being punished before they've
[2:31:14.080 --> 2:31:18.640]  even gotten a trial it's critically important they all be supported all of them every all 500 of them
[2:31:19.200 --> 2:31:24.080]  even if you disagree with them going inside the capital or disagree with their behavior that day
[2:31:24.080 --> 2:31:29.200]  you still need to support them because this is a political persecution by chai com agents
[2:31:29.200 --> 2:31:33.680]  who are authorizing their agents to shoot cops and burn down buildings and saying that's good
[2:31:33.680 --> 2:31:38.080]  where if you're an old woman walk between velvet ropes when the cops wave you in the FBI throws you
[2:31:38.080 --> 2:31:42.880]  in jail for three months with pleasure and they want dissension they want us all to turn on each
[2:31:42.880 --> 2:31:47.600]  other and disavow each other like we lost the ability to do credit card processing because
[2:31:47.600 --> 2:31:53.040]  i refused to disavow any member of both keepers ended the capital even though i didn't tell them
[2:31:53.040 --> 2:31:57.920]  to go in and i disagree with them going in i'm still saying hey they were right to due process
[2:31:57.920 --> 2:32:02.400]  they were right to to be be considered innocent till proven guilty but i'm not going to disavow
[2:32:02.400 --> 2:32:06.320]  them well this is like the tucker carlson point and and what's the governor to sanis is being attacked
[2:32:06.320 --> 2:32:11.120]  that whether whether chauvin was guilty or not i think it you know either way you can see it didn't
[2:32:11.120 --> 2:32:16.800]  go well i'm sad george floyd's dead the open intimidation of the jury and having presidents
[2:32:16.800 --> 2:32:20.960]  and members of congress saying you better do this or we're going to get violent i mean that is the
[2:32:20.960 --> 2:32:26.480]  biggest case of jury meddling i've ever seen yeah it's not a fair trial uh i mean you're a retired
[2:32:26.480 --> 2:32:30.800]  former lawyer i mean explain to people the issue here because chauvin could be guilty it doesn't
[2:32:30.800 --> 2:32:35.680]  matter you can't have a rigged trial like this no you can't have a situation where the jury is
[2:32:35.680 --> 2:32:41.200]  being pressured that if you don't convict will burn down your city or will kill you i believe
[2:32:41.200 --> 2:32:45.680]  they're even threatened personally that we know where you live we're going to come for you so
[2:32:45.680 --> 2:32:50.000]  that is they should be sequestered from the beginning but that's that causes a mistrial right
[2:32:50.000 --> 2:32:54.880]  there you can't get a fair trial in this country when you got you said you got politicians clamoring
[2:32:54.880 --> 2:32:59.360]  for a a conviction in a mob outside with military and bar bar around you saying you better do this
[2:32:59.360 --> 2:33:04.320]  that's ridiculous yeah let's start a fair trial i want to get into big picture where the country
[2:33:04.320 --> 2:33:08.000]  is going the chinese communist beach head that is dc and all the rest of the steward roads when we
[2:33:08.000 --> 2:33:12.720]  come back but but just a few minutes on yourself you've always been transparent to be against
[2:33:12.720 --> 2:33:17.120]  offensive violence the worst thing we would want would be to run in the capital and mess that up as
[2:33:17.120 --> 2:33:22.160]  we said we wanted a 10-day hearing that ted cruise probably had the votes for this was a big globalist
[2:33:22.160 --> 2:33:27.440]  victory having q people and antifa folks manipulate a few hundred folks to break through a few hundred
[2:33:27.440 --> 2:33:33.920]  more went in behind them i mean the idea that you best reminded it or i did is preposterous it's
[2:33:33.920 --> 2:33:38.800]  absurd i mean we have a we have a motto like one of our team leaders whip as a motto that boring is
[2:33:38.800 --> 2:33:44.000]  best in all the years we've done all the security operations across the country against antifa
[2:33:44.000 --> 2:33:48.480]  not once we were unholstered a weapon we've never pointed a gun at anybody we never pepper
[2:33:48.480 --> 2:33:53.040]  sprayed anybody never hitting me with a baton never even pepper sprayed anybody because
[2:33:53.040 --> 2:33:57.120]  the bad guys don't close on us because they're afraid of us and we want it that way we want it
[2:33:57.120 --> 2:34:02.880]  to be quiet and peaceful that's our that's our ammo so we're all about defensive use of force only
[2:34:02.880 --> 2:34:07.040]  if we have no other choice and we we try to use and you've got that track record so if they're
[2:34:07.040 --> 2:34:11.200]  dumb enough to indict you or anybody else that's a leader in this you just point out your history
[2:34:11.200 --> 2:34:15.760]  well it's it's so absurd about them saying that because our guys were in body armor and helmets
[2:34:15.760 --> 2:34:20.000]  and goggles that meant that they wanted to they had to say they ever come out to kill us that day
[2:34:20.000 --> 2:34:23.760]  that's why they're wearing all that they always wear that they're dressed like asking why does a
[2:34:23.760 --> 2:34:28.720]  riot cop wear gear exactly yeah so we always wear the same gear every time for the same reasons
[2:34:28.720 --> 2:34:32.960]  because we have violent communists who're trying to kill people in the streets and we need to be
[2:34:32.960 --> 2:34:36.560]  ready as you see the time magazine article where they admitted that they basically set it all up
[2:34:36.560 --> 2:34:41.680]  provocateur it and stood down that day on purpose said they were going to attack everybody so we'd
[2:34:41.680 --> 2:34:46.720]  be in gear so they can then blame us and then they dressed up as Trump supporters uh yeah but
[2:34:46.720 --> 2:34:50.640]  we're always wearing the same gear every time but I mean you've seen the footage of anti for
[2:34:50.640 --> 2:34:54.720]  putting on Trump gear right oh sure yeah we saw him in the street there and jade next
[2:34:54.720 --> 2:35:01.520]  yeah we got money for cnn yeah absolutely so you know so we need to realize in the big picture
[2:35:02.080 --> 2:35:08.080]  that we're in a fifth generation warfare unrestricted warfare as the chinese call it
[2:35:08.080 --> 2:35:14.160]  operation to destroy our country um and that's it's being successful right now but the silver lining
[2:35:14.160 --> 2:35:19.440]  for us is that by doing this they're destroying their own credibility so they're bleeding out
[2:35:19.440 --> 2:35:25.680]  credibility that's why I want them to go too far too fast I prefer that they go ahead and pack the
[2:35:25.680 --> 2:35:32.080]  court they go ahead and patch pass hr1 to rig all the elections from you know in perpetuity I prefer
[2:35:32.080 --> 2:35:36.880]  that they take the mask all the way off so that everyone can see it so everyone understands that
[2:35:36.880 --> 2:35:44.560]  we have to do stand up now together against this and stop running and hiding and stop hoping that
[2:35:44.560 --> 2:35:50.400]  someday in 2024 for example you know Trump will run again or general Flynn I think that's all
[2:35:50.400 --> 2:35:57.200]  fool's goal I think it's it's foolish to wait until 2024 thinking you'll have some you know hope
[2:35:57.200 --> 2:36:01.520]  of an electoral fix it's not going to happen so it's better for the mask to come all the way off
[2:36:03.280 --> 2:36:06.880]  you know the globalists have set it up where Biden and Harris are puppets but
[2:36:06.880 --> 2:36:09.840]  when the japanese prime minister shows up there's no one there to even meet them
[2:36:09.840 --> 2:36:13.680]  they're not even running policies they're just standing down there is no government right now
[2:36:13.680 --> 2:36:21.040]  it's just the country's being overrun looted well sure because a chinese puppet is going to do what
[2:36:21.040 --> 2:36:24.880]  he's been told to do and they don't they're not concerned with them they're no longer running this
[2:36:24.880 --> 2:36:31.120]  country or or running foreign policy on behalf of america's on on behalf of china so of course
[2:36:31.120 --> 2:36:34.720]  anything the chinese premier wants done is what's going to be done everything else to be thrown in
[2:36:34.720 --> 2:36:38.560]  the basket and if you ask how we've become so pathetic look at those democrats but then the
[2:36:38.560 --> 2:36:43.360]  republicans are intimidated by the media and so they're the real enemy because they're such
[2:36:43.360 --> 2:36:47.840]  incredible cowards turret roads outkeepers is our guest real thought criminal here speaking for
[2:36:47.840 --> 2:36:55.360]  himself live unfiltered the world is awakening the world is beginning to understand the globalist
[2:36:55.360 --> 2:37:01.680]  paradigm they are discovering the globalist the elites the manipulation the cfr the trilateral
[2:37:01.680 --> 2:37:08.960]  commission the bill berg group the bohemian grove the club of rome and so even though it seems
[2:37:08.960 --> 2:37:14.400]  like the globalists are winning the truth is they've had to come out the open to attack

[2:41:19.040 --> 2:41:23.920]  guys the headline that they wrote a good headline for it but we need to have original black panther
[2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:31.440]  exposes the george floyd trial hoax i don't even know how you get a do a headline good enough but
[2:41:31.440 --> 2:41:35.600]  test dirt roads you're with us in about 20 30 minutes the next hour matt bracken will be joining
[2:41:35.600 --> 2:41:39.520]  us co-hosting with us former navy seal patriot really smart guys been calling this the right
[2:41:39.520 --> 2:41:43.520]  stag fire 2.0 as you were saying during the break when i told you matt was coming up the
[2:41:43.520 --> 2:41:48.000]  right dog riot he calls it he's right but instead of me sitting here asking questions what else is
[2:41:48.000 --> 2:41:51.760]  on your radar screen big picture because we talked before he went live he said hey i don't want to
[2:41:51.760 --> 2:41:55.760]  talk so much about me or even oath keepers i want to talk about where we are as a country what's
[2:41:55.760 --> 2:42:00.640]  happening i mean this is the takeover this is the scuttling of the nation yeah in fact victor david
[2:42:00.640 --> 2:42:06.240]  hanson has a really awesome article he just put out that matt put out on his uh on his parlor account
[2:42:06.240 --> 2:42:12.400]  that lays out what's happening to our country it's being destroyed from within um and this but the
[2:42:12.400 --> 2:42:18.560]  silver lining is is that 100 million americans are awake in a red pill quite a few of them are in the
[2:42:18.560 --> 2:42:24.320]  military and police so we can't just presume all is lost that's what the bad guys want you to do
[2:42:24.320 --> 2:42:28.240]  it's kind of like in the lord of the rings where the leader of the one nation nothing was gone to
[2:42:28.240 --> 2:42:32.800]  or just steering into the into the crystal ball and he only sees what soran wants him to see only
[2:42:32.800 --> 2:42:38.320]  sees that the bad guys want him to see and he becomes dispirited and commits suicide and he
[2:42:38.320 --> 2:42:43.280]  doesn't defend the city so that's what if what you can't do is fall into this trap well everything's
[2:42:43.280 --> 2:42:48.560]  lost we can't win as everyone's is running that's right you've been hypnotized by a spirit of defeat
[2:42:48.560 --> 2:42:52.880]  absolutely right because he was looking and only seeing and the mainstream media does that to us
[2:42:52.880 --> 2:42:58.080]  they only show you what they want you to see you don't see all the times like like larry like larry
[2:42:58.080 --> 2:43:03.920]  pinkley yesterday you don't see the black activists from the original black panthers party um who are
[2:43:03.920 --> 2:43:08.320]  awakened aware of the agenda or out there in the streets you don't see and they got targeted by the fbi
[2:43:08.320 --> 2:43:12.320]  just like we are because they were real and they were real and they were non-racial they were they
[2:43:12.320 --> 2:43:16.880]  were they were you know trying to unite people at a grassroots level so i think that's that's the
[2:43:16.880 --> 2:43:22.320]  answer the answer is grassroots whether it's an inner city detroit i think there's a group out there
[2:43:22.320 --> 2:43:26.960]  forgot what it's called um something about renewing detroit but they but they are doing grassroots
[2:43:26.960 --> 2:43:30.960]  for taking care of their own neighborhoods and taking care of each other like the black panthers
[2:43:30.960 --> 2:43:34.240]  originally well yeah i don't agree with everything they should have islam does but at least they're
[2:43:34.240 --> 2:43:38.800]  about take care of yourself right don't count on somebody else and feeding kids before school and
[2:43:38.800 --> 2:43:43.200]  all that that's what that's what needs to happen in every community that's what they can't let me
[2:43:43.200 --> 2:43:47.440]  raise this because you you raise this and i make this point i see it on youtube and facebook and
[2:43:47.440 --> 2:43:50.880]  twitter because we're people still put our stuff out there but i on enforcers they go jones quit
[2:43:50.880 --> 2:43:55.840]  bragging you're famous that's not what i'm saying if you're not a steward roge or a tucker garlson
[2:43:55.840 --> 2:44:02.800]  or allen jones or a or a project veritas james o' keith you're not famous which is fine it's great
[2:44:02.800 --> 2:44:07.680]  we're not saying your bag is not famous what we're saying you don't get the feedback my feedback is
[2:44:07.680 --> 2:44:14.640]  95 positive it used to be 40 positive you know 10 years ago so i'm telling you i'm in the valley
[2:44:14.640 --> 2:44:19.680]  in all hispanic restaurant they all buy me dinner i'm in a black neighborhood they're packed me on
[2:44:19.680 --> 2:44:24.640]  the back that they're watching i'm in a chinese restaurant the owner comes out and buys me dinner
[2:44:24.640 --> 2:44:29.840]  people are hugely awake is what i'm telling you is because i'm a public figure because i'm known
[2:44:29.840 --> 2:44:34.800]  i'm like a gauge oh you like it like a like a drug test like is this positive for this we're
[2:44:34.800 --> 2:44:39.440]  positive for freedom i'm like a little stick you stick in because they know who i am it reacts
[2:44:39.440 --> 2:44:44.000]  and i'm telling you liberty is hotter than it's ever been right now does that make no i agree because
[2:44:44.000 --> 2:44:48.560]  because in the street when we're in the street defending the businesses against you know the
[2:44:48.560 --> 2:44:53.280]  communists and most of them are from out of the city like like in ferguson we're protecting a black
[2:44:53.280 --> 2:44:58.960]  owned bakery those are first customer and they were being told by the locals that hey these people
[2:44:58.960 --> 2:45:03.920]  don't live here they're coming from someplace else they're being bused in there are white communists
[2:45:03.920 --> 2:45:08.960]  putting together the mall times and handing them out so it's all engineered now there are of course
[2:45:08.960 --> 2:45:13.040]  there are some local thugs pick advantage of it it goes till tv's they'll pick you back yeah of course
[2:45:13.040 --> 2:45:18.320]  they'll always do that but the real agitators are always from outside the community coming in to
[2:45:18.320 --> 2:45:22.400]  cause trouble because they're pushing an agenda oh most of videos and people some people go why are
[2:45:22.400 --> 2:45:26.320]  you defending the black people i'm defending reality almost all the videos get so white you're
[2:45:26.320 --> 2:45:30.480]  going let's kill these white people let's kick them out of here and then they and then they get the
[2:45:30.480 --> 2:45:34.880]  blacks to attack the restaurant well and there and of course we saw in the in the interview that
[2:45:34.880 --> 2:45:39.760]  i think it was uh wasn't him only yesterday well he's talking to people in minneapolis you do have
[2:45:39.760 --> 2:45:42.720]  people who are in the black communities who those are black folks saying we may have struck
[2:45:42.720 --> 2:45:46.880]  killing the whites right so you do have this this this problem let's not sugarcoat that
[2:45:46.880 --> 2:45:51.200]  it's a legitimate problem it's a real problem it's a real problem but the way to fight it is
[2:45:51.200 --> 2:45:55.760]  in the streets at the grass sure but it's leftist academics like that white guy that came and planted
[2:45:55.760 --> 2:45:59.920]  the poison pills absolutely well it's been there a genus of the 60s uh it was look at this video
[2:45:59.920 --> 2:46:03.600]  the guys saying whites aren't welcome this restaurant well then why is your ass welcome you
[2:46:03.600 --> 2:46:12.720]  little boat ponytail bun wearing twerp seriously so it is the communist agenda they don't care about
[2:46:12.720 --> 2:46:16.880]  black people they just want to oh you can bet your bottom dollar that guy's a marxist absolutely so
[2:46:16.880 --> 2:46:20.800]  like you like larry said yesterday he's completely right they they're using the black community
[2:46:20.800 --> 2:46:24.320]  and trying to use them as a weapon against their own country but they don't care about them they'll
[2:46:24.320 --> 2:46:28.400]  be abandoned and thrown thrown away well remember the communists always lamented in the 50s and 60s
[2:46:28.400 --> 2:46:31.920]  they couldn't get blacks to join them remember that came out in the documents because they were
[2:46:31.920 --> 2:46:35.440]  anti-communist and they were they were christian so that's why they're they're they're trying to
[2:46:35.440 --> 2:46:40.480]  get blacks on their side again right well it's been it's been the strategy since the late 60s
[2:46:40.480 --> 2:46:47.520]  to adopt divide and conquer along racial lines and to use racial identity as their as their wedge
[2:46:47.520 --> 2:46:50.720]  inside the united states i mean look at this here's a black guy attacking a white truck driver
[2:46:50.720 --> 2:46:58.480]  because he's white it's just dumb so i think the big big big picture for us is that we need
[2:46:58.480 --> 2:47:03.600]  to realize reality like you know i told my guys and oath keepers hey if you're in a city this is
[2:47:03.600 --> 2:47:08.320]  before the shelvin decision came down if you're in a city take a vacation get out take your you
[2:47:08.320 --> 2:47:12.560]  and your family out of the city and to safety i don't know how you live in a city now my instincts
[2:47:12.560 --> 2:47:16.560]  i'm gonna live in the city but i might get oh far away from all of it absolutely so you gotta
[2:47:16.560 --> 2:47:21.600]  realize reality but you don't want to abandon the city either you want to make sure that the people
[2:47:21.600 --> 2:47:26.000]  who can go into those communities and that's going to require black patriots to go in there
[2:47:26.000 --> 2:47:31.120]  and work the grassroots and and do the hard do the hard job trying to deprogram people from the
[2:47:31.120 --> 2:47:35.920]  communist brainwashing but it's going to have to be them to do it so my god walk it in particularly
[2:47:35.920 --> 2:47:40.000]  easy if somebody actually reaches out to quote communities of color they're actually easier
[2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:44.800]  wake up than whites but nobody's reaching out to them well they they understand they've been lied to
[2:47:44.800 --> 2:47:48.560]  i think quite a few of them do they don't trust the system they don't trust the police police
[2:47:48.560 --> 2:47:53.200]  have lost legitimacy in a lot of these communities um and sometimes for good reason this will be
[2:47:53.200 --> 2:47:58.160]  really out real real about it they don't trust the police they don't trust the system so they're
[2:47:58.160 --> 2:48:03.840]  awake in that sense and there's but a lot of them still hold on to this false hope that the democratic
[2:48:03.840 --> 2:48:08.400]  party still cares about them that's the big red pill they gotta take and a lot of them are that's
[2:48:08.400 --> 2:48:13.280]  why trump got 52 percent of the black vote from black males he got a large percentage of the
[2:48:13.280 --> 2:48:18.080]  black man and that scares the system absolutely that and i think a large part of that was is that
[2:48:18.080 --> 2:48:22.720]  hey they they realized he was trying to help their communities but also they also realized that
[2:48:22.720 --> 2:48:28.960]  black lives matter is anti-male trying to destroy the family and destroy manhood well let's talk
[2:48:28.960 --> 2:48:33.760]  big picture though definitely the globalists are cutting off our pipelines developing the dollar
[2:48:33.760 --> 2:48:39.200]  destroying the military destroying the family there this is the final assault i don't think any
[2:48:39.200 --> 2:48:42.640]  folks i should think they do more beta testing no the final assaults here do you agree with that
[2:48:42.640 --> 2:48:48.640]  this is the big takeover i think it is and so we're in a like a sweet spot where they're losing
[2:48:48.640 --> 2:48:54.400]  credibility which is good but if we just sit on our hands and wait they're going to get to a point
[2:48:54.400 --> 2:48:59.040]  where they don't care about exactly Trump's waiting to make a missy man for uh no the sweet spot
[2:48:59.040 --> 2:49:05.120]  town i agree you can't wait we need to be organizing ourselves and becoming stronger
[2:49:05.120 --> 2:49:11.200]  and pushing back through nullification at the local level town county and state and and also
[2:49:11.200 --> 2:49:16.400]  uniting the warrior class of america that means the police and we have to be willing to go to the
[2:49:16.400 --> 2:49:21.200]  police and go look man we didn't like you enforcing the covid restrictions that was wrong we got to
[2:49:21.200 --> 2:49:24.800]  be blunt of you'll blunt with them about some of the things we don't like that they've done well
[2:49:24.800 --> 2:49:29.280]  places say no to cover restrictions everywhere which is good but we we want to so like like the
[2:49:29.280 --> 2:49:33.840]  officer anderson in the seattle when you get one who will stand up he must be supported 100
[2:49:33.840 --> 2:49:39.040]  percent financially so the message the message has to be to the cops that exactly got to make heroes
[2:49:39.040 --> 2:49:44.000]  out of real cops do it and if you do the right thing we will support you your family will not be
[2:49:44.000 --> 2:49:49.680]  in the street that's not true because we the patriots will make sure we donate to support you
[2:49:49.680 --> 2:49:54.960]  i agree but let's make no mistake the globalists are making a 100 percent move on america this is
[2:49:54.960 --> 2:50:00.240]  the assault right now it is and so if we wait too long they'll get to the point where we're all
[2:50:00.240 --> 2:50:06.400]  desperate and broke the dollars when crashed the cities are burning and they're repending our homes
[2:50:06.400 --> 2:50:10.560]  that's the plan of the communists it's been since the 60s they're going to say there's a new variant
[2:50:10.560 --> 2:50:14.400]  during the burning a new variant everybody's in your homes that's the announcement yeah well also
[2:50:14.400 --> 2:50:19.200]  also the arson is designed and the chaos is designed to pin you in your house also so we have
[2:50:19.200 --> 2:50:24.240]  to make sure that we organize now in our community so we're not pinned in our homes so our homes are
[2:50:24.240 --> 2:50:30.080]  safe it's like we have a thing we call family safe and oathkeepers we pledge to protect police fire
[2:50:30.080 --> 2:50:35.040]  ems families other emergency responders they can go out and do their jobs and same goes for you if
[2:50:35.040 --> 2:50:39.760]  you're going to be in a militia or a town watch whatever you've got set up you can't project out
[2:50:39.760 --> 2:50:44.720]  and protect the community if your own family and your own home is not safe you got to have a robust
[2:50:44.720 --> 2:50:49.280]  armed neighborhood watch program that gives you the ability to project out and you got to do it now
[2:50:49.280 --> 2:50:53.760]  folks this is the communist takeover right now but they're running the same play model that works in
[2:50:53.760 --> 2:50:56.960]  russia that was a different group the russians were tough they were great but they'd been searched

[2:52:47.680 --> 2:52:56.400]  that this is all a test this experience this wife on this planet is a reckoning it's god
[2:52:57.200 --> 2:53:01.680]  giving us a chance to work things out the third dimension so we can decide where we want to
[2:53:01.680 --> 2:53:06.320]  spend eternity and what level we want to go to and it really does come down to that so
[2:53:07.120 --> 2:53:10.960]  as sad as things are and as evil as things are look at all the good in the world as well and
[2:53:10.960 --> 2:53:18.480]  realize that god is the author of our consciousness god is the author of us having our own will god
[2:53:18.480 --> 2:53:24.960]  is the author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing and when you look at
[2:53:24.960 --> 2:53:30.480]  mainstream media in hollywood and this whole evil culture in washington dc and fauci and the and the
[2:53:30.480 --> 2:53:35.440]  mass cult it's all about dominating your free will it's all about telling you you're dirty your
[2:53:35.440 --> 2:53:40.160]  angle you're in bad because satan hates you because you're made in the image of god the creator of
[2:53:40.160 --> 2:53:48.160]  the universe you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:54:10.160 --> 2:54:25.920]  we now take you live to the central texas command center in the heart of the resistance you're
[2:54:25.920 --> 2:54:30.160]  listening to alex jones
[2:54:30.160 --> 2:54:36.160]  so
[2:54:36.160 --> 2:54:38.640]  what else is on your radar the founder of outkeepers
[2:54:39.680 --> 2:54:44.320]  embattled uh watching them claim you're the mastermind i guess trump gave the orders they're
[2:54:44.320 --> 2:54:51.040]  claiming along the santa claus to to attack the capital but next segment we've got oh
[2:54:52.000 --> 2:54:58.240]  iowa we've got oklahoma capital yesterday being attacked and actually you know rushed
[2:54:58.240 --> 2:55:02.000]  we're not saying they're terrorists we're not saying put them in fema camps but but again
[2:55:02.000 --> 2:55:06.160]  how is the left juxtaposed where they're calling for violence everywhere and seeing and saying
[2:55:06.160 --> 2:55:10.800]  whoever said demonstrations are peaceful but then you're just there you need to go to prison
[2:55:11.520 --> 2:55:16.640]  well i think it's good in the long run because it shows once again it erodes their credibility
[2:55:16.640 --> 2:55:22.800]  because everyone in the country can see the contrast the absurdity of you know peaceful people
[2:55:22.800 --> 2:55:27.360]  who never even had a traffic ticket their entire life being denied bail we got people are sitting
[2:55:27.360 --> 2:55:33.440]  in jail being denied bail who did nothing other than walk inside the capital through open doors
[2:55:33.440 --> 2:55:38.800]  retired fbi agents for cops were like waving them in walk right in looked around walk right
[2:55:38.800 --> 2:55:43.360]  back one of the guys is a retired fbi agent he's still in jail right so the and other people are
[2:55:43.360 --> 2:55:47.680]  just you know like i said just just you know veterans um peaceful americans have never done
[2:55:47.680 --> 2:55:52.720]  anything wrong their entire life and in contrast that to the treatment of likely the uh communist
[2:55:52.720 --> 2:55:58.480]  in portland who tried to burn alive us marshals inside of the the courthouse there and they're
[2:55:58.480 --> 2:56:02.480]  being let off as well to slap on the wrist even probation and community service they go pick up
[2:56:02.480 --> 2:56:06.880]  trash and then they're good that's the contrast and the military can see it that's why they're
[2:56:06.880 --> 2:56:11.200]  complaining about these ridiculous stand downs where they're being told they must you know read
[2:56:11.200 --> 2:56:14.560]  you know go through reeducation they're like wait why are you doing this in reaction to
[2:56:14.560 --> 2:56:19.520]  january 6 when when you did nothing about all the riots all last year so the riots this summer
[2:56:19.520 --> 2:56:26.640]  will only help to show more of the the ridiculous allison wonderland world we're in now so i think
[2:56:26.640 --> 2:56:30.960]  it's good to see that contrast i think it's good for law enforcement to see it for the military
[2:56:30.960 --> 2:56:35.360]  to see it but we can't just let them continue to do it because they'll go to the point where they
[2:56:35.360 --> 2:56:40.320]  don't care what we think they've got enough solidification of power and we're weak enough
[2:56:40.320 --> 2:56:45.520]  and desperate enough that they just no longer care about being seen as a legitimate that's why
[2:56:45.520 --> 2:56:50.000]  the military will if they get to the point where they purge out all of the people who are loyal
[2:56:50.000 --> 2:56:54.560]  to the constitution of the military they don't care about how weak the military becomes as long
[2:56:54.560 --> 2:56:59.520]  as they control it so that's why we're in this sweet spot where we wait too long they'll they'll
[2:56:59.520 --> 2:57:03.680]  get to the point where we have no patriots in the military and the same for the police and they'll
[2:57:03.680 --> 2:57:08.240]  it'll be the antifa and blm will run both the military will be in the military and the police
[2:57:09.520 --> 2:57:14.720]  what else are they going to pull um i think you'll see more more mass shootings i expect that
[2:57:14.720 --> 2:57:18.560]  but you know there's 100 million americans now who are awake that doesn't work on us
[2:57:18.560 --> 2:57:24.000]  we will not disarm that's the problem they have is we've got 100 million americans a lot of us
[2:57:24.000 --> 2:57:29.920]  and we're all armed did you see where democrat conjugal said america was convicted america is
[2:57:29.920 --> 2:57:35.040]  racist so it's not not just chauvin they're like saying when somebody kills somebody gun owners are
[2:57:35.040 --> 2:57:41.520]  guilty and when a cop does something possibly wrong all cops are guilty all america's guilty
[2:57:41.520 --> 2:57:46.640]  no one's going to buy this weird authoritarian psychology well look at the aclu's response to
[2:57:46.640 --> 2:57:51.120]  to the female officer shooting the guy in the car you know she she thought she had a taser
[2:57:51.120 --> 2:57:56.800]  she pulled her gun instead an absolute disaster of a screw up but you saw the reaction to aclu
[2:57:56.800 --> 2:58:01.520]  they just jumped right in and said this was indicative of the white supremacist culture
[2:58:01.520 --> 2:58:06.960]  of law enforcement in america so every cop out there now knows that okay no matter what we do
[2:58:06.960 --> 2:58:11.680]  we're going to be white supremacist and the entire police structure is white supremacist
[2:58:11.680 --> 2:58:17.280]  because the backdrop is that america the constitution our way of life is white supremacist that's
[2:58:17.280 --> 2:58:21.360]  that's the entire stick of the democrat talking point tucker played last night clip of the clip
[2:58:21.360 --> 2:58:27.440]  of democrat conjugal saying america has been convicted america is evil wow i didn't know
[2:58:28.320 --> 2:58:32.800]  and again what's outside america the chai comms the globalists the collapse of the world world
[2:58:32.800 --> 2:58:38.320]  government clout swabs e.g. pink so you're learning how bad america was look out for what you
[2:58:38.320 --> 2:58:42.800]  your new daddy is about to be because he'll put your ass in the death camp that fast they will
[2:58:42.800 --> 2:58:56.880]  this is back in the 60s grandie do right grandie do right thanks for holding her on the air go
[2:58:56.880 --> 2:59:02.880]  ahead challenge first of all let me say i love your products i am a granny and um for all the
[2:59:02.880 --> 2:59:07.840]  senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me i was loaded up with
[2:59:07.840 --> 2:59:13.760]  sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called but since taking your x2 for the last couple of
[2:59:13.760 --> 2:59:21.360]  years my skin is just really gorgeous actually people think i'm 55 years old and i was already
[2:59:21.360 --> 2:59:26.160]  taking your other supplements but i thought you know well maybe that's what i need to do because i
[2:59:26.160 --> 2:59:31.200]  just thought it was a hopeless situation but when i started taking it and it doesn't happen immediately
[2:59:31.200 --> 2:59:37.200]  but you know over a period of time i started noticing okay you know this is a ticket this is
[2:59:37.200 --> 2:59:43.680]  working this is wonderful you know i don't i don't have to put on derma blend anymore you know so
[2:59:43.680 --> 2:59:56.320]  anyway it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin you thought the lead
[2:59:56.320 --> 3:00:03.840]  in winter would bring you down forever but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun
[3:00:03.840 --> 3:00:12.880]  broadcasting live from the un stronghold austin texas you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:13.520 --> 3:00:20.560]  and the colors of the sea find your eyes was trending mammoth and you touch the distant beaches
[3:00:20.560 --> 3:00:26.640]  with tales of regularities i was made in a real paradise right now by the sirens at racket next
[3:00:26.640 --> 3:00:40.720]  to the next second everything we talked about 10 15 years ago is now here human animal cloning
[3:00:40.720 --> 3:00:48.480]  world government new world order uh white people are inherently evil it's more fantastical than i
[3:00:48.480 --> 3:00:54.080]  even thought it would be what is it like for you to start being a you know a father and a patriot
[3:00:54.080 --> 3:01:01.200]  an army veteran a lawyer all this stuff to now be here and be in the middle of this it's like so
[3:01:01.200 --> 3:01:05.200]  surreal we even have to go down this path because we know where the communists the globals are going
[3:01:05.200 --> 3:01:11.360]  to take us hell on earth because they're bad people this is just to me it's surreal yeah it is and as
[3:01:11.360 --> 3:01:16.640]  you said before it's bittersweet you know we're we're correct and we've been shown correct but
[3:01:16.640 --> 3:01:21.680]  now we're in a position of okay well what do we have to do and it's a big weight on my shoulders
[3:01:21.680 --> 3:01:26.880]  i'm sure you feel the same way is what's what's our responsibility and so we we have to be mindful
[3:01:26.880 --> 3:01:31.440]  that we're in a law fair situation where they're doing their best to suppress our free speech by
[3:01:31.440 --> 3:01:36.320]  threatening us with jail but we also have an obligation due to speak out and speak the truth
[3:01:36.320 --> 3:01:39.920]  and so i'll just say we're in our we're very close to our Patrick Henry moment
[3:01:39.920 --> 3:01:44.320]  where we have to realize this this is where we're at and we've got one way out is the fight
[3:01:44.320 --> 3:01:47.840]  that's where we're at that's where we're coming up on that of course i know the leftist will quote
[3:01:47.840 --> 3:01:51.680]  that and say i should be put in jail for saying it but that's where we're slightly they're the
[3:01:51.680 --> 3:01:55.440]  one saying burn everything and out and kill people they've got members of congress doing
[3:01:55.440 --> 3:02:00.640]  that we just say okay we'll defend ourselves we're like oh my god arrest you it's very paradoxical
[3:02:00.640 --> 3:02:04.960]  how they act right so but they have a big problem there's a hundred million of us and we're well
[3:02:04.960 --> 3:02:09.600]  armed um we're not well organized and we need to fix that but and they're going to use covid
[3:02:09.600 --> 3:02:14.000]  to lock down as a martial law cover sure of course but we all we all know that so what's
[3:02:14.000 --> 3:02:20.400]  important for us to do right now is become strong in ourselves in our local communities and get ready
[3:02:20.400 --> 3:02:26.480]  for hard times if they bring the fight to you you defend yourselves uh meanwhile though you've
[3:02:26.480 --> 3:02:31.840]  got to unite and you got to purge out the rhinos and the weenies outside of the republican party
[3:02:31.840 --> 3:02:35.120]  but that's it the left's not going to come down your street they're going to try to
[3:02:35.120 --> 3:02:38.800]  cause a riot and have black people do it they're cowards they want to use other people for their
[3:02:38.800 --> 3:02:44.800]  war sure so you have to do what you can to mitigate against that and that's why you need to get out
[3:02:44.800 --> 3:02:49.920]  of the cities if you're in a blue dominated area and i'm sure matt bracken will agree 100 percent
[3:02:49.920 --> 3:02:53.920]  you've got to get yourself out of there even though it's painful now it'd be a lot more painful if
[3:02:53.920 --> 3:02:57.920]  you wait too long you got to get out of those cities and there's a good documentary on you can
[3:02:57.920 --> 3:03:04.000]  find it on youtube on the span of civil war and what happened and wherever the communists and the
[3:03:04.000 --> 3:03:08.320]  and the anarchists were dominant they would drag people out of their homes who they consider
[3:03:08.320 --> 3:03:13.920]  right-wingers or traditionalists and they killed them so there was there were massacres that happened
[3:03:13.920 --> 3:03:18.880]  i'm sure those people and at their last moment did not realize that day when they woke up that
[3:03:18.880 --> 3:03:23.200]  they would wind up in a firing squad in front of a firing squad so you've got to get out of the blue
[3:03:23.200 --> 3:03:28.560]  dominated areas but then you also we also need to realize what's being done not just to us but also
[3:03:28.560 --> 3:03:33.120]  to the people in those blue dominated areas and we've got people who want to go back in there
[3:03:33.120 --> 3:03:37.680]  like missionaries and say hey man here's what's being done to you here's the truth and try to
[3:03:37.680 --> 3:03:45.200]  red fill them and let's be clear this is a real bolshevik banker funded russia 2.0 playbook i mean
[3:03:45.200 --> 3:03:49.120]  there i was watching a documentary about Stalin and i just believe the documentary i read a lot
[3:03:49.120 --> 3:03:52.800]  of books about it it was dead on accurate and all the tactics they're using they're doing the same
[3:03:52.800 --> 3:03:57.920]  playbook again yeah absolutely so it's divide and conquer and the big enemy of course is communist
[3:03:57.920 --> 3:04:03.200]  china on the outside looking at us and wanting this land i think i think not just the globalist but
[3:04:03.200 --> 3:04:10.560]  also the chai comms definitely want the the resources and the land it's liven's room right it's living
[3:04:10.560 --> 3:04:14.800]  space living space so they want the same thing that that the nazis wanted they wanted to go
[3:04:14.800 --> 3:04:19.920]  and they want to take over this land isn't it sad to watch all the soft collaborators
[3:04:19.920 --> 3:04:24.560]  they have no idea what they're even involved in i mean they are like involved in biblical level
[3:04:24.560 --> 3:04:31.600]  evil yeah it is sad and that's the thing is as as christians we need to be understanding that look
[3:04:31.600 --> 3:04:36.160]  man no one's beyond redemption um it's important for us to understand that there are people inside
[3:04:36.160 --> 3:04:40.960]  of the intelligence community still who believe their patriots they joined a lot of them joined
[3:04:40.960 --> 3:04:47.200]  after 9 11 i know guys that dhs we joined post 9 11 to fight terrorism and now they're being
[3:04:47.200 --> 3:04:51.280]  turned against us so we need to understand that none of them are beyond redemption and we need to
[3:04:51.280 --> 3:04:54.640]  be willing to reach out oh i agree this is that this is that this is that of what side you're on
[3:04:54.640 --> 3:04:59.520]  not government anti-government any of that what about the postal service spying on patriots i mean
[3:04:59.520 --> 3:05:04.000]  it's just it's all just incredible yeah well it's all being being weaponized to turn against us so
[3:05:04.000 --> 3:05:09.520]  the way we way we respond though is what matters now we should respond with hey we'll just double
[3:05:09.520 --> 3:05:13.120]  down on our well yeah that's supposed to intimidate us oh i'm actually glad you're tuning in you're
[3:05:13.120 --> 3:05:17.360]  hearing the truth you know and there's nothing oh you're bad we're watching you oh you think i'm
[3:05:17.360 --> 3:05:22.560]  a coward like you yeah they want you to be be afraid to talk to that person or this person
[3:05:22.560 --> 3:05:26.080]  or just say what you're gonna say they want to i mean that's like i mean that's like in the old
[3:05:26.080 --> 3:05:31.520]  Soviet Union hey we're reading your mail look out i mean wow what an admission of you're the bad guys
[3:05:31.520 --> 3:05:35.680]  so i think we should start calling them bolshevik start calling them uh call them nazis it would
[3:05:35.680 --> 3:05:39.600]  really freak them out i think no i agree this is a red army pull the label on them well not just
[3:05:39.600 --> 3:05:44.960]  communists but call them nazis too you know why not only Gestapo so i think it's i think it's good
[3:05:44.960 --> 3:05:49.040]  we should be protesting outside of the post office right now saying why is the post office you know
[3:05:49.040 --> 3:05:54.320]  jumping into the arms of big brother and helping big brother you know i agree i'd call for nationwide
[3:05:54.320 --> 3:05:58.560]  protest starting tomorrow for the next week it doesn't matter if you're one man one woman doesn't
[3:05:58.560 --> 3:06:04.080]  matter go up expose the fact that i don't pay taxes to have the post office spy on me they'll
[3:06:04.080 --> 3:06:08.320]  be totally freaked out by that because they did this to try to intimidate us yeah and boycott them

[3:12:22.400 --> 3:12:38.320]  to the alex jones show
[3:12:38.320 --> 3:12:48.240]  so
[3:12:51.440 --> 3:12:57.280]  here we are friends you were just in the presence of two men that i consider real patriots
[3:12:58.000 --> 3:13:05.520]  and it's getting real because you know that the deep state these sold out traders there's nothing
[3:13:05.520 --> 3:13:15.120]  they'd like more than to see the last two gentlemen buried under the prison super maxed and not only
[3:13:15.120 --> 3:13:22.480]  because they hate them but because of their symbols and it would it would lead the deep state things
[3:13:22.480 --> 3:13:29.680]  that would lead to greater demoralization and more fear among other patriots and i think that
[3:13:29.680 --> 3:13:36.880]  that these deep state traders they misjudge our character they don't understand that they're just
[3:13:36.880 --> 3:13:43.760]  building up a backlash they think that the the same beatdown tools that they use against ordinary
[3:13:43.760 --> 3:13:52.160]  sheep are going to work against men and women of character of deep patriotism and i and i think
[3:13:52.160 --> 3:13:58.160]  that they're going completely uh in a counter in a counterproductive way from their point of view
[3:13:58.160 --> 3:14:07.760]  they don't understand what they're going against you know this is a serious time and i hear constantly
[3:14:08.320 --> 3:14:14.880]  people can't believe it they can't believe where america is how far we've fallen how fast we've fallen
[3:14:15.920 --> 3:14:23.040]  and i i quote again the great michael yawn war correspondent currently he's down at the
[3:14:23.040 --> 3:14:30.560]  darien gap in panama you're recording what's happening and he says if you keep if you're
[3:14:30.560 --> 3:14:37.760]  continuously surprised if you're continuously in shock by the events around you then your paradigm
[3:14:37.760 --> 3:14:46.000]  is obsolete you need to come up with a new paradigm that matches observed reality and the new paradigm
[3:14:46.000 --> 3:14:54.560]  that you need is that our government has been taken over now it's impossible to say if the key
[3:14:54.560 --> 3:15:02.000]  players are literally sold out chinese stooges and agents although that is certainly not out of the
[3:15:02.000 --> 3:15:09.360]  realm of possibility you know when when you see um biden and hunter on air force two going over and
[3:15:09.360 --> 3:15:17.440]  making their billion dollar deals suffering no ramifications whatsoever being elevated into
[3:15:17.440 --> 3:15:23.920]  the white house through what i still consider to be a completely bogus and fraudulent election
[3:15:24.640 --> 3:15:33.600]  where the results were shifted and the the the rot is so deep the rot is so wide that the mainstream
[3:15:33.600 --> 3:15:41.280]  media is part of this entire cabal so we're not going to you know waiting for 60 minutes to do a
[3:15:41.280 --> 3:15:48.320]  story on the take the communist takeover of america that's a useless and worthless endeavor
[3:15:48.880 --> 3:15:55.520]  because that's never going to happen instead we're going to see 60 minutes doing a you know
[3:15:55.520 --> 3:16:04.400]  quote unquote expose on oathkeepers turning patriots into domestic extremists that's where we are
[3:16:05.280 --> 3:16:13.200]  the paradigm has to include the fact that the department of justice and the fbi are entirely
[3:16:13.200 --> 3:16:23.520]  taken over by these subversive traders they still wear their their fbi and doj badges they've still
[3:16:23.520 --> 3:16:31.440]  got the the id in their wallet but they are as far as i'm concerned oath breakers they are traders
[3:16:32.320 --> 3:16:37.920]  they would they would you know just to collect their paycheck and hopefully stay around long
[3:16:37.920 --> 3:16:45.040]  enough to earn a pension they are they are turning completely turning around completely
[3:16:45.040 --> 3:16:54.640]  against the constitution and stamping and trampling on it that's what i say you know anybody by now
[3:16:54.640 --> 3:17:01.200]  should be familiar with yuri bezmanov and the amazing tapes that he made in the 80s with um
[3:17:01.200 --> 3:17:09.680]  with edward griffin well we're seeing the final culmination of it now and even the bezmanov tapes
[3:17:09.680 --> 3:17:16.400]  you can go all the way back beyond bezmanov in the 80s to the 1920s with the frankfurt school in
[3:17:16.400 --> 3:17:25.760]  germany and gram c in italy this plan has been underway for a century now this the plan was to
[3:17:25.760 --> 3:17:36.720]  pour poison to deliberately poison the roots of america's soul namely our patriotism our love of
[3:17:36.720 --> 3:17:46.320]  religion and our devotion to our families the the plan was to pour poison on these by taking over
[3:17:46.320 --> 3:17:56.800]  the institutions and deliberately be smirching and fouling what we love the most our flag our
[3:17:56.800 --> 3:18:05.760]  religions and our families this was not an accident this demoralization has been going on now for in
[3:18:05.760 --> 3:18:13.040]  in our entire lifetimes and now we're watching our schools down to the kindergartens being turned
[3:18:13.040 --> 3:18:22.160]  into little little critical race theory brainwash sessions just something i saw today at amazon
[3:18:22.720 --> 3:18:30.080]  employees have to engage in what you would consider in mal's china these self-criticism
[3:18:30.080 --> 3:18:38.640]  sessions where they literally you know verbally scourge themselves as racists and this is percolating
[3:18:38.640 --> 3:18:45.840]  not only through you know universities but now high schools and grade schools these white equals
[3:18:45.840 --> 3:18:56.240]  evil sessions well in the in the um in in china in the 60s this led to the cultural revolution
[3:18:56.240 --> 3:19:02.560]  there was never a period where mal just came out and said let's go crazy and start
[3:19:03.120 --> 3:19:11.040]  whipping and beating and killing professors and landlords he didn't have to because for more than
[3:19:11.040 --> 3:19:19.760]  10 years before that all of the chinese textbooks and lessons lesson plans did i just lose the connection
[3:19:19.760 --> 3:19:28.400]  screen went black there for a session section i not sure if i'm still there maybe somebody pulled
[3:19:28.400 --> 3:19:34.800]  the plug i mean maybe i'm getting a little bit too close to the nerve but mal didn't need to
[3:19:35.600 --> 3:19:41.760]  say now is the day let's go start the cultural revolution when the schools taught this crap
[3:19:41.760 --> 3:19:49.280]  for more than 10 years that the professors the shopkeepers and the landlords were the evil oppressor
[3:19:49.280 --> 3:19:57.920]  class and the students and the tenants and the people that used the shops were the victim class
[3:19:57.920 --> 3:20:04.400]  eventually this this idea took over in the mind of chinese to the extent that the crowds just
[3:20:04.400 --> 3:20:11.760]  formed and went wild and we're seeing something like that coming to america but it won't be on a
[3:20:11.760 --> 3:20:19.040]  on a class just on a class level because america is more of a land of upward mobility i mean you
[3:20:19.040 --> 3:20:25.600]  see LeBron LeBron James and Oprah Winfrey you know they're they're certainly black but they are
[3:20:25.600 --> 3:20:32.720]  certainly not you know financially oppressed so the adaptation for the communists takeover of
[3:20:32.720 --> 3:20:40.400]  america the local adaptation was formed as critical race theory the race part was added just for
[3:20:40.400 --> 3:20:46.320]  america because that would be the weak point that would be the that would be the spot in our
[3:20:46.320 --> 3:20:53.600]  national soul that could be probed and exposed and magnified and turned into you know the the
[3:20:53.600 --> 3:21:01.040]  reason for every problem in america and now we're seeing it coming to the point where
[3:21:01.040 --> 3:21:08.320]  even little children are being brainwashed like little communist zealots to hate white people
[3:21:08.320 --> 3:21:14.400]  and for whites to even hate their whiteness and it's going to a very bad place and on the other
[3:21:14.400 --> 3:21:19.920]  side of this break i'm going to continue on this you know listeners call into the show and they thank
[3:21:19.920 --> 3:21:27.200]  me and it makes me feel pathetic because i sit there and i beg you for support constantly for
[3:21:27.200 --> 3:21:32.480]  prayer for financial support and for word of mouth and then we're all this together and i you know
[3:21:32.480 --> 3:21:36.480]  it gets old having to come to you and say hey i got great products please buy them or we won't be
[3:21:36.480 --> 3:21:40.480]  here on air but it's true we're the only media organization in the United States that promotes
[3:21:40.480 --> 3:21:45.680]  liberty at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and almost
[3:21:45.680 --> 3:21:49.840]  shut down everybody else they crippled all the other groups and we're still here and as this whole
[3:21:49.840 --> 3:21:54.960]  new world order comes out in the open our credibility is going up that's why we've got to be taken
[3:21:54.960 --> 3:21:59.600]  off air that's why america has got to be taken down you can't have all these other nations enslaved
[3:21:59.600 --> 3:22:04.960]  and america is still quasi free you can't have info wars has been proven right be on air with all
[3:22:04.960 --> 3:22:09.600]  the craziness that's about to unfold because if you think stuff's bad now just get ready so thank you

[3:22:23.520 --> 3:22:28.800]  say first off thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn
[3:22:28.800 --> 3:22:35.360]  people i've been trying to get a hold of you for a year okay i'm a double amputee and i have bacteria
[3:22:35.360 --> 3:22:41.760]  infection on my lung that'll never go away uh living defense saved my life they had me on antibiotics
[3:22:41.760 --> 3:22:47.600]  for two years that almost killed me living defense brought me back i wanted to just quote from the
[3:22:47.600 --> 3:22:54.320]  bible jesus is saying as to where we are right now this is matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall
[3:22:54.320 --> 3:23:02.240]  deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name
[3:23:02.240 --> 3:23:08.320]  say and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another
[3:23:08.320 --> 3:23:12.720]  that's right where we're at brother and that's because god's name is on the founding of this
[3:23:12.720 --> 3:23:17.520]  country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because god created this country
[3:23:18.720 --> 3:23:24.000]  i'm a very humble person but i'm also a bold person and so as bad as things are with the
[3:23:24.000 --> 3:23:28.400]  globalist attacking humanity with all the terrible things that are unfolding i want you to know
[3:23:28.400 --> 3:23:34.400]  that a lot of positive things are happening as well i'm a public figure so i get to see things
[3:23:34.400 --> 3:23:38.480]  the general public doesn't get to see and let me tell you whether it's police chiefs or members of
[3:23:38.480 --> 3:23:45.600]  congress or even folks in hollywood or or or mainstream media or industry people are really
[3:23:45.600 --> 3:23:50.880]  really awake in the establishment they don't want to go along with the globalists but they're scared
[3:23:50.880 --> 3:23:55.600]  they're looking for leadership well that's where info works you know what i'm saying you fund us

[3:25:21.920 --> 3:25:45.600]  listening to the alex jones show live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones and
[3:25:45.600 --> 3:25:58.400]  now your host matt bracken seeing my uh seeing my book covers there um i wrote the first one
[3:25:58.400 --> 3:26:06.960]  false flag operation to disarm americans uh around 2003 and i hope and i think that it gives me a
[3:26:06.960 --> 3:26:10.960]  little bit of freedom to talk more freely than maybe some other people because i wrote that
[3:26:10.960 --> 3:26:19.520]  that long before this current administration or trump or even obama so messing with me legally
[3:26:20.160 --> 3:26:28.560]  would just lead to my books being you're gaining more more notoriety and my greatest my greatest
[3:26:28.560 --> 3:26:34.560]  legacy i think is the books that are out in print you know people can buy them on kindle and auto
[3:26:34.560 --> 3:26:40.400]  audible but i think they're going to just disappear poof decision will be made the books are dangerous
[3:26:40.400 --> 3:26:47.040]  they'll be gone but there's too many thousands of them out in american homes already so i hope
[3:26:47.040 --> 3:26:52.240]  that gives me some freedom to speak in a way that maybe other people with a little less
[3:26:53.280 --> 3:27:00.800]  little net less recognition can't or wouldn't would be afraid to it's too easy now to lose a job
[3:27:01.520 --> 3:27:06.480]  anybody with a smartphone in their pocket and another smartphone in their friend's pocket
[3:27:06.480 --> 3:27:12.160]  anything you say could be recorded it could be used to fire you from your job kick you out of the
[3:27:12.160 --> 3:27:19.600]  military you know or or even years from now punish you in some other way companies already are
[3:27:19.600 --> 3:27:26.480]  being given a a score you know like a social justice score and it's just a matter of time until
[3:27:27.120 --> 3:27:33.680]  american citizens get our own social justice score a social credit system probably starting
[3:27:33.680 --> 3:27:39.840]  with a vaccine card you know and then your necessary booster shots if you don't have it
[3:27:39.840 --> 3:27:44.160]  you can't get a job you won't keep your job you won't be able to go back to school you won't be
[3:27:44.160 --> 3:27:51.120]  able to get on an airplane in dark times are coming i mentioned earlier that the great
[3:27:51.520 --> 3:27:57.520]  war correspondent michael yawn is down there at the darien gap people don't understand this the
[3:27:57.520 --> 3:28:05.360]  pan the pan american highway does not go all the way through panama to columbia there's a 60 mile
[3:28:05.360 --> 3:28:12.480]  gap at the bottom of panama that is nothing but a jungle and the people that emerge from the jungle
[3:28:12.480 --> 3:28:20.640]  after a week on jungle trails being robbed raped many of them murdered what's the first building
[3:28:20.640 --> 3:28:27.760]  they see i heard this on uh bannon's war room this morning michael yawn was calling in on a sat phone
[3:28:28.480 --> 3:28:33.760]  the first building they see is a western union money center the first thing on concrete with a
[3:28:33.760 --> 3:28:41.680]  roof western union this is a well financed expedition or or actually like a mass migration
[3:28:41.680 --> 3:28:50.800]  invasion as soon as these people emerge into the the bureaucracy of panama they are recorded
[3:28:51.440 --> 3:28:57.200]  they're a little bit of data is taken and they are put on panamanian government buses and taken
[3:28:57.200 --> 3:29:02.400]  straight to the coast to rican border then they're taken straight country by country
[3:29:02.960 --> 3:29:09.120]  straight up through mexico they're not walking folks this is a financed invasion
[3:29:09.120 --> 3:29:18.400]  and and what's it all about it's a it's one aspect of this of of this um critical race theory
[3:29:19.360 --> 3:29:27.920]  is to overwhelm america with so many migrants that have no understanding of our
[3:29:29.680 --> 3:29:35.440]  my screen's black again i i don't know what's going on with the my computer or my connection
[3:29:35.440 --> 3:29:42.720]  and anyway i hope i'm still recording but we are being overwhelmed intentionally
[3:29:43.360 --> 3:29:51.440]  this is all part of of what sam france is called anarcho anarcho tyranny which is
[3:29:51.440 --> 3:29:57.600]  to just beat down a country you know we're going to the patriots will be disarmed they think
[3:29:57.600 --> 3:30:04.640]  the patriots will be disarmed criminals will be given free reign will be so demoralized we
[3:30:04.640 --> 3:30:12.320]  think there's absolutely nothing we can do and meanwhile two million new democrat voters
[3:30:12.320 --> 3:30:19.600]  are being brought over the open border per year they're being sent to swing states they'll be
[3:30:19.600 --> 3:30:25.920]  voting in the next elections if the democrats pass this hr1 and we can't rule anything out
[3:30:25.920 --> 3:30:34.800]  if they pass hr1 anybody can show up anybody can show up and place a provisional ballot
[3:30:35.360 --> 3:30:43.360]  anybody can get a mail-in ballot at any address in america no signature verification no photo id
[3:30:44.080 --> 3:30:52.720]  park put down an x vote democrat and we're america zuella game over and the people that
[3:30:52.720 --> 3:31:00.160]  are still inside of our government you especially the ones that wear the gold badges the fleas the
[3:31:00.160 --> 3:31:09.280]  federal law enforcement agency officers these guys have to look in the mirror and say am i just like
[3:31:09.280 --> 3:31:18.000]  a of a branch officer in vici france taking my orders from a nazi in the next room is that really
[3:31:18.000 --> 3:31:25.360]  what it's come down to the country is being taken over from the inside by communists and i'm just
[3:31:25.360 --> 3:31:32.400]  going to stick it out for my paycheck in my pension putting patriots in jail and letting
[3:31:32.400 --> 3:31:41.200]  communist anarchists like antifa and blm riot loot and burn the last thing i've just read is
[3:31:41.200 --> 3:31:47.760]  is everybody that's been arrested and charged federally in portland they're dropping the charges
[3:31:48.560 --> 3:31:54.960]  it's just going away meanwhile people who wandered into the capital through open doors
[3:31:54.960 --> 3:32:02.640]  on january 6th some of them are still rotting in jail in hard time i mean you know getting beatings
[3:32:02.640 --> 3:32:10.160]  in jail being fed garbage intentionally you know getting the the punishment is the process
[3:32:10.160 --> 3:32:16.640]  only it's worse because you're in a cockroach infested jail picking cockroaches out of the
[3:32:16.640 --> 3:32:24.320]  slop that they feed you in order to torture and punish you this is our country today this is
[3:32:24.320 --> 3:32:33.600]  what's happening in america in 2021 this is part of what urie bezmanov called the demoralization
[3:32:33.600 --> 3:32:40.480]  process you know they they did experiments with lab rats that were that were meant to to test
[3:32:40.480 --> 3:32:46.720]  something called learned helplessness where the lab rats have to do little tests and get a food
[3:32:46.720 --> 3:32:53.200]  a pellet you do little jumps run little mazes get a food pellet or sometimes they get an electric
[3:32:53.200 --> 3:32:59.680]  shock when it's randomized when the electric shocks are randomized eventually the rats will
[3:32:59.680 --> 3:33:05.360]  just lay there they'll give up they'll just figure hey you know if i do all the things they want me
[3:33:05.360 --> 3:33:10.000]  to do i may get a pellet or i may get a shock so i'm just going to lay there and get shocked
[3:33:10.880 --> 3:33:18.080]  that's the goal of this anarcho tyranny it's to make us like those lab rats just lay there
[3:33:18.080 --> 3:33:25.440]  and be shocked it's called learned helplessness we are now the lab rats getting the shocks you
[3:33:25.440 --> 3:33:32.240]  know saying what the hell i can work forever they close my store with some bogus covet regulation
[3:33:32.240 --> 3:33:38.640]  meanwhile across the street walmart is booming including the mcdonald's inside the walmart
[3:33:38.640 --> 3:33:45.680]  while my store is closed and i'm broke this is all learned helplessness you know in the military
[3:33:46.560 --> 3:33:53.360]  they're kicking out at purging conservatives going through old social media you know the way
[3:33:53.360 --> 3:33:59.600]  that the united states postal service is doing with american citizens today they're doing it on a
[3:33:59.600 --> 3:34:06.880]  very high scale starting with officers in the military going through years old social media
[3:34:06.880 --> 3:34:13.920]  posts to then bring people up and put them you know on the do not promote list basically the
[3:34:13.920 --> 3:34:21.360]  purge list letting them know there's no place for you in the military meanwhile incompetence
[3:34:21.360 --> 3:34:28.240]  are being promoted wholesale and this is going to lead to a disaster if we ever have a war
[3:34:28.800 --> 3:34:35.440]  as we saw when you have incompetent leadership on the bridge of the warships mccain and Fitzgerald
[3:34:35.440 --> 3:34:41.920]  they couldn't even stay out of the way of slow tankers we're supposed to believe that these high
[3:34:41.920 --> 3:34:49.360]  tech warships are going to be able to fight off incoming salvos of chinese or russian hypersonic
[3:34:49.360 --> 3:34:56.480]  missiles and they are so incompetently run that they can't avoid tankers well this tells me our
[3:34:56.480 --> 3:35:03.120]  military has no intention of fighting china or russia none at all they're gearing up for an
[3:35:03.120 --> 3:35:10.080]  internal war against american patriots in the resistance and when we come back i'm going to

[3:39:51.200 --> 3:40:02.640]  okay we're having some technical issues here i don't know if it's just my computer or if
[3:40:04.800 --> 3:40:10.240]  the boys in the basement so to speak are messing with the wires who knows
[3:40:11.200 --> 3:40:18.000]  yeah we're we're um we're definitely in it now folks this is why i'm not working on a book what's
[3:40:18.000 --> 3:40:23.920]  the point we're in the book now we're in it and some of the things that we're going to see
[3:40:24.800 --> 3:40:30.240]  i know i know people are very are crazy about bitcoin but i think that bitcoin is
[3:40:30.240 --> 3:40:37.280]  going to be a trap and if you have a chance to move out of it with a profit i would because
[3:40:37.280 --> 3:40:44.160]  country by country the national banks are going to move to digital currency there is no doubt about
[3:40:44.160 --> 3:40:50.400]  it they're going to have all kind of excuses but think about the control it will give them
[3:40:51.280 --> 3:40:58.160]  they'll not only be able to know what everybody purchased when and where they're going to be able
[3:40:58.160 --> 3:41:07.280]  to add double or triple for some favored groups oh you're this group gets a $2,000 stimulus
[3:41:07.280 --> 3:41:13.120]  another group the oppressors they don't get a stimulus where you won't be able to buy guns we
[3:41:13.120 --> 3:41:18.800]  don't want you to buy guns guns are on the bad list guns may cost you double digital money
[3:41:19.520 --> 3:41:25.360]  do you think as this emerges they're going to let you keep a parallel system going in bitcoin
[3:41:26.160 --> 3:41:33.280]  this is a fool's trap folks you're going to find out that that bitcoin is going to be
[3:41:33.840 --> 3:41:40.800]  either either cracked and taken away or just made illegal the way that roosevelt made gold
[3:41:40.800 --> 3:41:46.880]  illegal they're going to they're going to move everybody into digital currency and then they're
[3:41:46.880 --> 3:41:52.880]  going to forbid you doing contracts and precious metals or in any kind of an of an alternative
[3:41:53.440 --> 3:41:59.680]  this is going to give the government full full control and power over your life it won't be
[3:41:59.680 --> 3:42:05.120]  like why more germany where you have to bring a wheelbarrow full of money you know to the bakery
[3:42:05.120 --> 3:42:11.120]  to buy a loaf of bread it's not going to be like that because everybody will in essence everybody
[3:42:11.120 --> 3:42:17.840]  will have some form of an ebt card you know your good citizen card and depending on your social
[3:42:17.840 --> 3:42:24.160]  credit score you're going to get more or less digital dollars put in we're already seeing the
[3:42:24.160 --> 3:42:29.760]  beginning of this of what's called a universal basic income that's what these stimulus checks are
[3:42:29.760 --> 3:42:36.960]  preparing us for you know restaurant owners and and and bar owners they they say that they can't
[3:42:36.960 --> 3:42:43.440]  even get people to come back to work as they open they can't get people to come back to work because
[3:42:43.440 --> 3:42:49.920]  people are getting unemployment benefits plus their stimulus checks that are that make them they'd
[3:42:49.920 --> 3:42:55.200]  be fools to come back to work for you know 11 or 12 bucks an hour they're making more than that to
[3:42:55.200 --> 3:43:02.480]  stay home you know the the government is not going to give up this control they're going to just keep
[3:43:02.480 --> 3:43:08.720]  it up you know keep going and keep going until the only money is their digital money now we'll
[3:43:08.720 --> 3:43:14.560]  still have hyperinflation but it's going to be in a way worse because they're going to be able to
[3:43:14.560 --> 3:43:20.800]  channel the money to the favored groups they're going to be able to channel the money away from
[3:43:20.800 --> 3:43:28.000]  disfavored groups like us and then they're going to be able to just outlaw products they think you
[3:43:28.000 --> 3:43:34.480]  have too many of nobody needs nobody needs a car with that many horsepower that's going to cost
[3:43:34.480 --> 3:43:41.600]  double it will be a way to tax everything just by adjusting the algorithms inside of the federal
[3:43:41.600 --> 3:43:46.800]  banking system which will be completely digital they're going to get rid of the money the the
[3:43:46.800 --> 3:43:53.280]  cash money they're going to transition right out of that this is very predictable so I would suggest
[3:43:53.280 --> 3:44:00.080]  any any high value high dollar items you've been putting off like you know a new a new roof on your
[3:44:00.080 --> 3:44:06.480]  house do it now while the money still has some value if you put off things like getting that new
[3:44:06.480 --> 3:44:13.840]  roof you may find out that that in two or three years they've whacked zeros off of your bank account
[3:44:13.840 --> 3:44:20.320]  or they've added zeros and put everybody onto a new digital currency but your old bank account
[3:44:20.320 --> 3:44:26.400]  doesn't get updated so you're you know the the hundred thousand in the bank that you have might
[3:44:26.400 --> 3:44:34.960]  not pay for you know a front door or much less a roof job so get those things done now now what
[3:44:34.960 --> 3:44:41.360]  can you do other than being prepared moving away from the blue hives moving out of the red states
[3:44:41.360 --> 3:44:47.760]  you know Stuart Rhodes at the end of the last the last hour he was saying try to red pill folks
[3:44:48.400 --> 3:44:53.280]  in the blue zones I don't think that's in the in the near term in the mid term I don't think
[3:44:53.280 --> 3:45:01.760]  that's even possible Yuri Besmanoff in his lectures or in his podcasts with Griffin he's
[3:45:01.760 --> 3:45:08.320]  very explicit about that these people are like religious cultists you can present them with
[3:45:08.320 --> 3:45:15.520]  the the truth with the truth you can prevent them with with you know the actual reality pictures
[3:45:15.520 --> 3:45:22.320]  evidence everything they will not be moved now we're brainwashing children from kindergarten
[3:45:22.320 --> 3:45:30.240]  up it reminds me of of hitler youth or the red guards or polepots little fanatical children
[3:45:30.240 --> 3:45:37.360]  soldiers you are not going to red pill these people you have to get away from them you know
[3:45:37.360 --> 3:45:44.160]  when Yugoslavia broke up there were places like in the western province of Yugoslavia called Slovenia
[3:45:44.720 --> 3:45:52.160]  where there was almost no effect from the civil war so by moving now out of a blue state away
[3:45:52.160 --> 3:45:59.680]  from blue cities you can do the most to protect yourself and when you get to a safer area even
[3:45:59.680 --> 3:46:08.240]  if it's in an RV or a trailer when you get to a safer area get involved you know the thing that
[3:46:08.240 --> 3:46:14.960]  has allowed the communists to win this long march through the institutions is conservatives just
[3:46:14.960 --> 3:46:20.560]  stayed at home raised their families earned a living and didn't pay attention to who was running
[3:46:20.560 --> 3:46:27.280]  the local PTA who was running the local school board that's how these communists took over
[3:46:27.280 --> 3:46:33.680]  by stealth they got involved we have to get involved and we have to be loud when we get
[3:46:33.680 --> 3:46:40.720]  involved don't let them call you with you know oh you just have all that white privilege call them
[3:46:40.720 --> 3:46:49.120]  communists i totally agree with stort roads on this critical race theory is just code for communism
[3:46:49.120 --> 3:46:57.600]  2.0 don't use their language you know don't don't fall into that trap when they say you're a racist
[3:46:58.240 --> 3:47:06.240]  just say that's what all the communists are trained to tell us like the founders of BLM
[3:47:06.240 --> 3:47:12.800]  who admitted that they were trained marxists anytime they turn the racist on you turn the
[3:47:12.800 --> 3:47:19.040]  communist on them and call them traitors to the greatest country this that the world's ever known
[3:47:19.760 --> 3:47:27.040]  you don't put up with it don't just shrink away never shrink away now there's not a whole lot
[3:47:27.040 --> 3:47:34.960]  that we can do other than moving but when you are when as to the max to them that you can
[3:47:34.960 --> 3:47:42.400]  besides getting involved politically support politicians who are going to support nullification
[3:47:42.400 --> 3:47:47.040]  i don't think that secession talking about secession is not going to be successful
[3:47:47.760 --> 3:47:53.440]  you know there's a there's a congressman in texas that was talking i think yesterday in
[3:47:53.440 --> 3:47:59.920]  in congress he said maybe texas made a big mistake the federal government is not uh
[3:47:59.920 --> 3:48:05.840]  following its primary purpose which is to protect our borders it's right in the constitution
[3:48:06.640 --> 3:48:11.920]  and jerry nadler went nuts and called him a practically a confederate and said you know
[3:48:11.920 --> 3:48:17.680]  what happened the last time states succeeded didn't go too well for them well outside of
[3:48:17.680 --> 3:48:25.440]  pure secession i think that the way to go is nullification support politicians who will
[3:48:25.440 --> 3:48:32.720]  declare their jurisdictions whether it's a town a county or a state to be sanctuary states
[3:48:33.280 --> 3:48:40.400]  bill of rights sanctuary states and any law or executive order that's been passed
[3:48:40.400 --> 3:48:49.360]  under this bogus congress you know in a senate that's 50 to 50 plus one or by a president
[3:48:49.360 --> 3:48:56.320]  who was elected quote unquote fraudulently in your own heart and at the state and local level
[3:48:56.960 --> 3:49:05.280]  know that these are bogus invalid laws you and promise yourself you will never shrink away from
[3:49:05.280 --> 3:49:10.720]  from defying these laws particularly when it comes to the first amendment which i'm doing
[3:49:10.720 --> 3:49:17.440]  right now like storton and alex were and also when it comes to the second amendment any gun
[3:49:17.440 --> 3:49:25.200]  that was legal to own in 2020 as far as i'm concerned it's legal to own forever and anybody
[3:49:25.200 --> 3:49:30.640]  that wants to take it is going to have to come and get it the hard way that's a promise and
[3:49:30.640 --> 3:49:36.080]  everybody needs to make that promise at the individual level and at the and at the community
[3:49:36.080 --> 3:49:41.680]  level and at the state level we're not going to solve this at the federal level the communists
[3:49:41.680 --> 3:49:48.240]  have taken over all of the federal organs half of the republicans might as well be democrats
[3:49:48.240 --> 3:49:53.920]  so there's really no hope at the at the federal level but at the state and local level there's
[3:49:53.920 --> 3:49:59.760]  plenty of hope and and we'll continue this the next time hopefully you know if there's still
[3:49:59.760 --> 3:50:06.720]  an alex jones showing but if i get the call but get involved they want you to quit
