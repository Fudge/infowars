[00:00.000 --> 00:14.600]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:14.600 --> 00:21.840]  The date is March 27th. The year is 2020 on this Friday global transmission.
[00:21.840 --> 00:25.520]  Here are 220 days out from the election.
[00:25.520 --> 00:29.920]  And I can say authoritatively that this is the most informative
[00:29.920 --> 00:34.720]  well-researched broadcast in the world.
[00:34.720 --> 00:39.920]  And it is the most listened to by people in industry, the general public and
[00:39.920 --> 00:43.200]  experts in governments everywhere want to know exactly what's happening.
[00:43.200 --> 00:46.240]  It's just a fact and it's a great responsibility.
[00:46.240 --> 00:49.200]  And I am honored to be here and to be your host for this to be the people's
[00:49.200 --> 00:54.720]  independent media fighting against this post-human
[00:54.720 --> 01:00.640]  globalist operation. These are the times that trimen souls.
[01:00.640 --> 01:05.680]  Absolutely most critical transmission ever coming up but I want to air this
[01:05.680 --> 01:09.360]  little compilation that Rob did a great job putting together
[01:09.360 --> 01:13.040]  of just some of the Democrats and deep staters celebrating
[01:13.040 --> 01:17.280]  the coronavirus and the collapse of the economy hoping for it now celebrating it.
[01:17.280 --> 01:22.240]  And then there's new announcements by GQ calling America a crap whole country
[01:22.240 --> 01:25.440]  and hoping it all falls apart. Here's the report.
[01:25.440 --> 01:29.920]  That's because you tweeted earlier linking the closing of the country to your
[01:29.920 --> 01:34.400]  election success in in November. Is this Easter timeline based on your
[01:34.400 --> 01:38.560]  political interests? You tweeted you said that the
[01:38.560 --> 01:41.360]  media wants the country to remain closed to hurt your
[01:41.360 --> 01:43.840]  own defeat. No, I think the media just see you understand.
[01:43.840 --> 01:46.400]  Are you ready? I think there are certain people that would
[01:46.400 --> 01:49.840]  like it not to open so quickly. I think there are certain people that
[01:49.840 --> 01:53.600]  would like it to do financially poorly because they think that would be very
[01:53.600 --> 01:55.840]  good as far as defeating me at the polls.
[01:55.840 --> 01:59.360]  Because I think one way you get rid of Trump is a crashing economy
[01:59.360 --> 02:03.280]  so please bring on the recession. One woman said I want a recession because
[02:03.280 --> 02:06.240]  that'll help get rid of Donald Trump. I call this another
[02:06.240 --> 02:10.320]  Trump slump. The threat of recession is real. We would see the global economy
[02:10.320 --> 02:14.000]  entering recession in three quarters. Perfect timing I say.
[02:14.000 --> 02:16.960]  I mean I've been rooting for a recession. But if the global economy
[02:16.960 --> 02:20.320]  including the United States is taking a step toward recession what does that
[02:20.320 --> 02:24.880]  mean for this presidency? It's political suicide. These numbers
[02:24.880 --> 02:28.480]  are irrefutable. There are people in your profession
[02:28.480 --> 02:32.400]  that would like that to happen. I think it's very clear.
[02:32.400 --> 02:36.880]  I think it's very clear that there are people in your profession that write
[02:36.880 --> 02:41.760]  fake news. You do, she does. There are people in your profession that write
[02:41.760 --> 02:45.200]  fake news. They would love to see me for whatever reason
[02:45.200 --> 02:49.360]  because we've done one hell of a job. Nobody's done the job that we've done.
[02:49.360 --> 02:52.880]  The president went on Fox News and lied to millions of people about the
[02:52.880 --> 02:56.240]  coronavirus outbreak as his administration bungles its response
[02:56.240 --> 02:59.920]  to the crisis. For more on this it's time for a closer look. With the world
[02:59.920 --> 03:04.160]  on edge people are looking to their leaders for reassurance and answers.
[03:04.160 --> 03:08.000]  Unfortunately we have him. It's a serious thing that needs to be dealt with
[03:08.000 --> 03:11.680]  seriously and right now the federal government is
[03:11.680 --> 03:16.000]  failing to stop lying. When in the middle of a severe public health
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.440]  emergency the president just lies about it over and over and over again.
[03:19.440 --> 03:23.200]  Trump is lying to people about the potential threat posed by the spread of
[03:23.200 --> 03:26.480]  the coronavirus. This may be Donald Trump's Katrina.
[03:26.480 --> 03:30.880]  Donald Trump is not in charge here. The governors are in charge.
[03:30.880 --> 03:35.040]  This is an event that could take down a president.
[03:35.040 --> 03:39.280]  And it's lucky that you have this group here right now for this problem
[03:39.280 --> 03:43.360]  or you wouldn't even have a country left okay. How dare you.
[03:43.360 --> 03:47.600]  Batman is failing right now. This may be Donald Trump's Katrina.
[03:47.600 --> 03:52.720]  Yeah you kind of have to put my role in that. I mean let's just lean into that.
[03:52.720 --> 03:58.560]  How many deaths are acceptable? Yeah how many none. But as far as the
[03:58.560 --> 04:02.240]  winning economy that the president needs from now until November
[04:02.240 --> 04:05.600]  do you really see that changing? If the stock market were to tumble this year
[04:05.600 --> 04:09.520]  if we don't get near the 3% GDP growth that this administration has been
[04:09.520 --> 04:13.520]  talking about for years these are all things that Dems can run on and they
[04:13.520 --> 04:16.960]  pose a problem. A recession is a survivable event.
[04:16.960 --> 04:21.520]  What Trump is doing to this country is not.
[04:24.000 --> 04:28.160]  Fear is freedom. Subjugation is liberation.
[04:28.160 --> 04:32.640]  Contradiction is truth. Those are the facts of this world
[04:32.640 --> 04:38.400]  and you will all surrender to them. You pigs in human clothing.
[04:48.400 --> 04:55.760]  Sorry. Go ahead. No no I probably best I don't.
[04:55.760 --> 04:58.400]  Stay with us.
[04:58.400 --> 05:02.960]  Every week. Every day. Every hour. Every minute.
[05:02.960 --> 05:06.960]  Every second right now is critical. History is happening
[05:06.960 --> 05:10.400]  right in front of us and we can't be spectators. We've got to be men and women
[05:10.400 --> 05:14.560]  in the arena regardless of race, color, creed, age, sexual privacy. It doesn't
[05:14.560 --> 05:18.400]  matter. The globalist with the chai comms and others are openly trying to
[05:18.400 --> 05:21.920]  plunge our economy and start a new depression. China who hyped up this
[05:21.920 --> 05:26.320]  virus is now back to work and ramping up their economy while ours is going into
[05:26.320 --> 05:29.600]  a freefall spiral and Trump's desperately trying to restart it
[05:29.600 --> 05:34.000]  and create confidence and the globalist corporate media that was worshiping China
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.440]  just a month or so ago and their response is saying Trump
[05:37.440 --> 05:41.680]  is terrible because they want America to fail. They want you to fail
[05:41.680 --> 05:45.280]  but you can expose them. You can speak out. You can share the articles and
[05:45.280 --> 05:49.200]  videos and reports at info wars and band-op video that expose them
[05:49.200 --> 05:53.200]  and the globalist will go down. It's already blowing up in their face right
[05:53.200 --> 05:58.800]  now. So press the attack on the info war and defeat the N.W.O.
[06:06.480 --> 06:18.800]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[06:18.800 --> 06:27.280]  We are told it is the greatest threat ever to face humanity.
[06:27.280 --> 06:33.840]  That when this virus has run its course we will never be the same.
[06:33.840 --> 06:39.520]  We will no longer shake hands. We will now be
[06:39.520 --> 06:42.880]  the bubble people.
[06:43.600 --> 06:47.440]  But of course all the in-depth studies show that folks that aren't exposed to a
[06:47.440 --> 06:52.080]  lot of viruses and bacteria are weak links
[06:52.080 --> 06:56.720]  and that vaccines may actually give you a resistance sometimes
[06:56.720 --> 07:03.360]  against the pathogen against the virus or bacteria
[07:03.360 --> 07:08.000]  that it helps your body learn immunity to but that it always lowers the
[07:08.000 --> 07:11.760]  overall immunity. But it's all about forced
[07:11.760 --> 07:16.080]  inoculation. It's all about medical tyranny surveillance.
[07:16.080 --> 07:19.120]  It's all about six months in jail if you don't properly
[07:19.120 --> 07:23.760]  social distance. That's what the Chicago
[07:23.760 --> 07:28.240]  mayor is saying and Singapore passed a law
[07:28.240 --> 07:32.640]  stories up on news wars dot com.
[07:34.960 --> 07:42.240]  That if you don't stay six feet apart six months in prison and the Austin
[07:42.240 --> 07:49.440]  police go down on the green belt with the Barton Creek full of water
[07:50.080 --> 07:55.840]  more than 30 miles of it and they tell people to stop swimming.
[07:55.840 --> 08:02.320]  Don't be outside as the hysteria
[08:03.200 --> 08:06.480]  expands and now they're saying the United States
[08:06.480 --> 08:13.360]  is the global epicenter. Why the whole country is covered in red
[08:13.360 --> 08:18.240]  the way the model works. Less people have died worldwide
[08:18.240 --> 08:22.000]  from the coronavirus this year than died
[08:22.000 --> 08:28.560]  of the flu last year. 35,000 have died 21,000 have died from the
[08:28.560 --> 08:33.760]  coronavirus supposedly 35,000 the US 80,000 died
[08:33.760 --> 08:38.160]  were into the CDC in 2018 from the flu the worst flu
[08:38.160 --> 08:45.920]  in years despite record inoculation the worst fluid more than 40 years.
[08:45.920 --> 08:50.320]  So there's no doubt that the hysteria spigot has been turned on high like a
[08:50.320 --> 08:54.320]  fire hose and the big news is there is a major
[08:54.320 --> 08:59.840]  showdown is now official. Democrat cities, Democrat counties, Democrat
[08:59.840 --> 09:03.760]  states are going to hold hostage along with Democrat and
[09:03.760 --> 09:08.320]  globalist controlled corporations and companies and infrastructure.
[09:08.320 --> 09:14.800]  The economy at least through the election
[09:14.800 --> 09:18.320]  and they've got a plan being adopted for mail-in ballots
[09:18.320 --> 09:21.760]  that'll be filled out in the names of lots of dead people
[09:21.760 --> 09:25.760]  that will magically defeat Donald Trump and so
[09:25.760 --> 09:29.520]  Russia gate didn't work, Ukraine gate didn't work, they released a virus, they
[09:29.520 --> 09:31.840]  know the trajectory of they know what it's going to do
[09:31.840 --> 09:38.240]  it does kill people it is a threat but then the hysteria and the
[09:38.240 --> 09:43.840]  stampede off the cliff is the real threat
[09:43.840 --> 09:47.600]  and President Trump is absolutely right
[09:47.600 --> 09:51.040]  that the cure is worse than the disease and that if we have
[09:51.040 --> 09:54.480]  a depression you want to see death from people having
[09:54.480 --> 09:59.600]  malnutrition it'll just be called the flu it'll be called
[09:59.600 --> 10:03.680]  an illness it'll be called tuberculosis but that's how you get run down like in
[10:03.680 --> 10:07.920]  the 1930s seven million people starving to death
[10:07.920 --> 10:11.120]  if it happens today we'll never recover from it
[10:11.120 --> 10:17.120]  and this is 21st century war we've got
[10:17.760 --> 10:22.320]  how many thousands of people dead in the united states
[10:22.320 --> 10:26.880]  how many deaths
[10:27.840 --> 10:35.360]  you've got China at 8,000, Spain at 4,000, Italy at 3,000,
[10:35.360 --> 10:40.160]  Iran 2,000 let's hit refresh on that guys
[10:42.960 --> 10:50.480]  but we're told that we absolutely need to give up control
[10:50.480 --> 10:54.400]  of our entire culture and our entire society
[10:54.400 --> 10:58.720]  for a little more than a thousand deaths and let's say it hits 80,000
[10:58.720 --> 11:04.160]  did we shut the u.s down for 80,000 dead it's the way it works
[11:04.160 --> 11:07.680]  it's how the planet operates
[11:08.800 --> 11:13.120]  infectious disease until about 1900 was the main cause of death
[11:13.120 --> 11:16.720]  but when we got sanitation laundry detergent
[11:16.720 --> 11:21.200]  and indoor running water and sewer
[11:22.320 --> 11:27.600]  when the nation's streets were no longer the sewer line
[11:27.600 --> 11:32.400]  when the feces no longer dumped out to the front of your house
[11:32.400 --> 11:36.720]  we put screens on our doors so the mosquitoes wouldn't bite us
[11:36.720 --> 11:40.560]  you know look at the graphs infectious disease goes down over 95
[11:40.560 --> 11:43.520]  percent then vaccines come in in the 40s
[11:43.520 --> 11:47.840]  an actual infectious disease goes back up it goes down 90 plus percent goes to
[11:47.840 --> 11:50.960]  back up about 20 percent the same graph in England
[11:50.960 --> 11:57.040]  Germany France Australia Canada US the graphs are famous
[11:57.040 --> 12:00.320]  infectious disease goes down down down to the 40s
[12:00.320 --> 12:04.400]  and then it goes up up up with the vaccines that actually lowered our
[12:04.400 --> 12:10.000]  immunity and they know exactly what they are
[12:10.000 --> 12:15.920]  doing let me before I really dig into what the
[12:15.920 --> 12:18.560]  president needs to do what we the people need to do what we're really
[12:18.560 --> 12:22.320]  facing next segment just give me some of the headlines here
[12:22.320 --> 12:26.880]  Texas orders 14 day quarantine for New York New Jersey and Connecticut the
[12:26.880 --> 12:30.240]  New Orleans travelers saying do not come
[12:30.240 --> 12:34.240]  in to Texas that is all the main epicenters and that makes sense if you're
[12:34.240 --> 12:37.440]  gonna have a quarantine to isolate it the places that
[12:37.440 --> 12:40.480]  actually have the major outbreaks
[12:41.200 --> 12:45.840]  also I want to do an article on this because it's hiding in plain view it
[12:45.840 --> 12:50.800]  it happened the Democrats didn't want us to stop
[12:50.800 --> 12:55.840]  Chinese from flying here when everybody else had banned them a few months ago
[12:56.480 --> 13:00.160]  and it's also the Chinese that came here under government orders
[13:00.160 --> 13:03.280]  and bought up all the m95 mask and the medicine
[13:03.280 --> 13:07.360]  and that stopped shipments of medicine that would already been paid for
[13:07.360 --> 13:09.840]  to the United States Australia and other countries and
[13:09.840 --> 13:12.560]  actually stole it
[13:14.000 --> 13:19.840]  but then the left celebrates gq has a story out gq writer saying America is a
[13:19.840 --> 13:23.680]  crap hole because we're the epicenter and it's our fault and we're bad so
[13:23.680 --> 13:27.760]  China that pro-generated this is the good guy
[13:27.760 --> 13:32.400]  ggping is the good guy we're the bad guys the America hating as a
[13:32.400 --> 13:36.720]  matter of course as a matter of the very fabric of these people
[13:36.720 --> 13:40.960]  is just incredible and Trump is not up there saying it's the
[13:40.960 --> 13:44.000]  Democrats demanded we keep the borders open and when I tried to block the
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.880]  Chinese coming in he should be bringing that up more
[13:46.880 --> 13:50.480]  he should be bringing up all of this because these people are out of control
[13:50.480 --> 13:55.360]  and yes it's a Chinese virus you always say
[13:55.360 --> 13:58.560]  where something came from like Rocky Mountain tick
[13:58.560 --> 14:06.480]  fever or the Spanish flu it first came out of there
[14:06.480 --> 14:11.920]  or any of these diseases they almost always have the name of where
[14:11.920 --> 14:18.640]  they originated from and the idea that oh forget China
[14:18.640 --> 14:21.840]  make it Trump's fault so every debt that happens is his fault
[14:21.840 --> 14:25.440]  that's the narrative and they had that scripted eight weeks ago
[14:25.440 --> 14:31.040]  we let it all out and it happened and the fact that
[14:31.040 --> 14:34.880]  they're now going to hold the country hostage
[14:34.880 --> 14:40.400]  and have admitted they are and are not going to open it back up for business
[14:40.400 --> 14:45.200]  they're saying at least for the election maybe 18 months
[14:45.200 --> 14:50.400]  is incredible and just to see that more Americans aren't supporting the
[14:50.400 --> 14:54.320]  president the majority are in in polls we know it's
[14:54.320 --> 14:58.480]  huge what's even higher numbers than 55 65 percent putting on the poll
[14:58.480 --> 15:02.480]  but still there's a large portion of this country a large minority
[15:02.480 --> 15:05.200]  they could be old they could be young they could be black they could be white
[15:05.200 --> 15:09.200]  who really have taken on the ethos of hating this country
[15:09.200 --> 15:13.280]  they've really taken on the world view of authoritarianism and they think it's
[15:13.280 --> 15:16.080]  cute they get off on complying with things
[15:16.080 --> 15:18.960]  that don't even empower them they're not part of the power structure
[15:18.960 --> 15:23.360]  but by acquiescing to it and then by hin pecking others and by
[15:23.360 --> 15:26.400]  tattling on others if they're coughing or if they're not social
[15:26.400 --> 15:28.640]  distancing here in the united states and places like
[15:28.640 --> 15:33.360]  chicago and austin and places like london yeah i've got the articles right
[15:33.360 --> 15:35.600]  here when we come back paul watson's joining us
[15:35.600 --> 15:38.720]  at the bottom of the hour
[15:38.800 --> 15:41.680]  they are openly calling the police on people
[15:41.680 --> 15:45.440]  throwing footballs or playing tennis or swimming in a creek
[15:45.440 --> 15:48.800]  even it's just three or four people and the police are coming and arresting them
[15:48.800 --> 15:52.240]  even the law doesn't even say that because everyone wants to virtue signal
[15:52.240 --> 15:57.200]  how compliant they are to the system that's not what built this country folks

[20:22.960 --> 20:26.480]  resistance to tyrants
[20:26.480 --> 20:33.920]  resistance to tyrants his obedience to god it's alex jones
[20:33.920 --> 20:37.760]  all right let me just state the facts so that everybody understands
[20:37.760 --> 20:44.160]  where we're really at on new year's eve
[20:44.720 --> 20:53.440]  starting this year ending 2019 every tv channel every news program
[20:53.440 --> 21:00.880]  from fox news the cnn to local cbs ran tickers
[21:00.880 --> 21:05.280]  alex jones lost a lawsuit for attacking sandy hook children
[21:05.280 --> 21:08.320]  none of that was even true
[21:08.960 --> 21:13.040]  and they do that on a routine basis on every channel
[21:13.040 --> 21:19.040]  including cruise ships in south africa that's on the little handout at your
[21:19.040 --> 21:22.880]  door every morning on the front alex jones attack people's
[21:22.880 --> 21:27.840]  children why do they do that
[21:27.840 --> 21:30.640]  because the order from the shadow government went out
[21:30.640 --> 21:34.640]  programmed in to the mockingbird system there were congressional hearings
[21:34.640 --> 21:40.080]  about this in the 70s operation mockingbird to make me a villain now
[21:40.080 --> 21:45.760]  why are they doing that because when the council on foreign relations
[21:45.760 --> 21:49.040]  and the atlantic council
[21:49.040 --> 21:56.240]  and all of these other globalist organizations tune into this show
[21:56.560 --> 22:02.080]  they know i know about the organization of economic cooperative development
[22:02.080 --> 22:05.120]  as the main root corporation of the whole world government
[22:05.120 --> 22:10.080]  they know i know about the xm bank they know that i really have done the
[22:10.080 --> 22:17.120]  research and i know what their in-game plan is and it freaks them out
[22:17.120 --> 22:20.240]  because most of their minions only have part of it even high-level
[22:20.240 --> 22:24.000]  globalist and so we're decompartmentalizing it
[22:24.000 --> 22:28.640]  ahead of those phases that are supposed to be rolled out later
[22:28.640 --> 22:33.760]  after they stage new big trigger events like what you're seeing with
[22:33.760 --> 22:38.640]  covid-19 the chi-com globalist virus
[22:38.640 --> 22:44.320]  so you have to understand this broadcast with the guest and the calls and myself
[22:44.320 --> 22:49.200]  and the crew is the zeitgeist
[22:51.200 --> 22:55.520]  it's like a the running man when they take over the tv station and air the
[22:55.520 --> 22:58.320]  tape showing that it's all fake television and the
[22:58.320 --> 23:03.360]  government's villainous and run by criminals and it's game over
[23:03.360 --> 23:07.680]  but it's not that simple the globalists tune in and they go if people
[23:07.680 --> 23:11.120]  ever pay attention to this if they ever look into this
[23:11.120 --> 23:14.240]  it's over for us
[23:16.160 --> 23:20.960]  now before they can put me in prison or kill me they've got to kill my name
[23:20.960 --> 23:25.360]  as a populist nationalist christian patriot and destroy that name before
[23:25.360 --> 23:29.200]  they kill me but they do intend to kill me
[23:30.000 --> 23:36.080]  that's okay i'm not worried about me i'm worried about the true
[23:36.080 --> 23:42.000]  anti-human evil that seeks to literally sterilize
[23:42.000 --> 23:47.680]  every man child on the planet by law that's their admitted tapestock institute
[23:47.680 --> 23:50.400]  plan to quote end all war you end the mail
[23:50.400 --> 23:53.440]  that's why you see that in the movies you see the feminist groups saying we
[23:53.440 --> 23:56.160]  should abort male babies we should outlaw male
[23:56.160 --> 23:59.840]  fetuses this is put out now by mainline groups
[23:59.840 --> 24:03.120]  you're like well that sounds horrific it is horrific
[24:03.120 --> 24:07.840]  they are eugenicists it's not about empowering women
[24:07.840 --> 24:10.960]  once men are removed
[24:12.240 --> 24:15.040]  females are the main target actually of their system and
[24:15.040 --> 24:18.160]  it's the end of humanity
[24:18.880 --> 24:25.520]  and so you have to come to grips with what a diabolical world government
[24:25.520 --> 24:28.320]  system this is and why would wire magazine say
[24:28.320 --> 24:32.800]  and why would cfr members say and why would high-level cia operatives say
[24:32.800 --> 24:38.000]  in the news he is the man who you may not say his name
[24:38.000 --> 24:41.040]  it's what i'm saying that they don't want to be known and people said well
[24:41.040 --> 24:44.720]  that's ridiculous if you say don't say somebody's name that'll backfire no
[24:44.720 --> 24:48.320]  if you look at the conformity of the ivory towers the conformity of the
[24:48.320 --> 24:52.160]  universities the conformity of the left and how they
[24:52.160 --> 24:56.720]  revel in conformity and how they believe their collectivist
[24:56.720 --> 25:00.400]  on some good mission they're such useful idiots
[25:00.400 --> 25:02.800]  smucks
[25:03.760 --> 25:10.560]  that in their own world and system they have submission to the tyranny
[25:10.560 --> 25:13.760]  and they have submission to the lie they're delusional
[25:13.760 --> 25:17.520]  they're becoming dumber they're dying they're becoming bankrupt
[25:17.520 --> 25:21.280]  they're not having children they're dead they're they're depressed
[25:21.280 --> 25:25.120]  they're statistically destroyed all the metrics show
[25:25.120 --> 25:29.040]  but still they delusion only believe in the great quest
[25:29.040 --> 25:32.080]  that if they can pull down america and pull down christ
[25:32.080 --> 25:36.400]  and if they can rearrange the family that somehow their university degree
[25:36.400 --> 25:40.400]  as a liberal as a leftist will put them in a position of power
[25:40.400 --> 25:46.560]  in this new utopian vision that they're all going to run someday
[25:46.560 --> 25:52.800]  but first they've got to make you submit to the model that they have for you
[25:52.800 --> 25:57.360]  which is an anti-human model and you ask why do they keep trying that
[25:57.360 --> 26:00.640]  because if you are following the real human model
[26:00.640 --> 26:05.360]  encoded in you by god you will be successful you'll be empowered
[26:05.360 --> 26:08.880]  you will have a relationship with god and the universe god created
[26:08.880 --> 26:12.320]  you will interface with it you will have discernment you will be fulfilled
[26:12.320 --> 26:16.000]  you won't need them
[26:17.280 --> 26:24.800]  the fallen wish to take you with them period misery loves company
[26:24.800 --> 26:30.320]  and so it's good to be humble i'm an extremely humble person
[26:30.320 --> 26:33.840]  we don't do this for temporal power we do this
[26:33.840 --> 26:37.440]  to empower humanity for the future and not let
[26:37.440 --> 26:42.160]  innocence and the seed of the universe that is our children be destroyed
[26:42.160 --> 26:45.680]  by these openly wicked people that have now admitted their plan
[26:45.680 --> 26:50.000]  is a post-human system and they believe they're saving the earth by
[26:50.000 --> 26:53.840]  exterminating us and that they will then merge with machines and become gods
[26:53.840 --> 26:58.640]  that cosmology that i exposed 26 years ago
[26:58.640 --> 27:01.840]  was in their own white papers now it's externalized
[27:01.840 --> 27:08.320]  and as david ike said yesterday these anti-human operatives
[27:09.200 --> 27:14.560]  non-human force whatever it is behind it we know it's there we see its actions
[27:14.560 --> 27:20.800]  has gone from hiding their plan to emerging they're now selling their
[27:20.800 --> 27:25.840]  plan and when you don't work when you don't
[27:25.840 --> 27:29.840]  build when you don't strive you become lackadaisical
[27:29.840 --> 27:33.600]  unhappy corrupt decadent twisted but more importantly
[27:33.600 --> 27:38.560]  domesticated and obsolete and ready for the fire
[27:38.560 --> 27:42.480]  that's why they're building this world where humans aren't needed
[27:42.480 --> 27:47.440]  that's why it's not it's not progress it is
[27:47.440 --> 27:51.840]  destruction they didn't put the native americans on the
[27:51.840 --> 27:57.120]  reservations to empower them they put them there to exterminate them slowly
[27:57.120 --> 28:00.400]  so this this isn't progress this is an overwrite this
[28:00.400 --> 28:04.080]  is a post-human world and president trump understands that
[28:04.080 --> 28:07.200]  and we're not going along with their post-human world so they're forcing it
[28:07.200 --> 28:10.880]  with this virus here's the president
[28:11.680 --> 28:16.000]  we have to get back to work our people want to work they want to go back
[28:16.000 --> 28:21.360]  they have to go back and we're going to be talking about dates we're going to
[28:21.360 --> 28:24.880]  be talking with a lot of great professionals
[28:24.880 --> 28:28.560]  but this is a country that was built on
[28:28.560 --> 28:32.240]  getting it done and our people want to go back to work i'm hearing
[28:32.240 --> 28:36.000]  i'm hearing it loud and clear absolutely but
[28:36.000 --> 28:39.520]  oh but we're all scared everyone's going to die
[28:39.520 --> 28:42.640]  they'll be deaths if he doesn't shut it down yeah they'll be deaths from flu like
[28:42.640 --> 28:48.240]  80 000 in 2018 and 35 000 last year but now a thousand deaths and we're on
[28:48.240 --> 28:51.600]  our knees shaking in fear at least some people are with
[28:51.600 --> 28:55.840]  paramilitary drones flying around telling us stay in our homes
[28:55.840 --> 29:00.640]  yeah we can all agree these are troubled times right

[30:13.280 --> 30:16.640]  i remember that interview he said he was going to do it and he did a great job
[30:16.640 --> 30:20.240]  you'll be very proud of our country four years ago
[30:20.240 --> 30:24.160]  then billionaire businessman donald trump pledged himself
[30:24.160 --> 30:28.240]  to info wars in our audience that he would not let us down
[30:28.240 --> 30:31.440]  that he would take the globalist on and that we would be
[30:31.440 --> 30:35.760]  very pleased with what he did we are pleased with president trump
[30:35.760 --> 30:40.480]  he has proven that he's the real deal and has taken the globalist on the level
[30:40.480 --> 30:44.720]  that before seen but now they're striking back at president trump
[30:44.720 --> 30:49.120]  and the people using the invisible weapon of fear the coronavirus
[30:49.120 --> 30:52.320]  yes we should meet the virus head on yes we should
[30:52.320 --> 30:56.000]  save as many people as possible but not at the expense of our hard-fought
[30:56.000 --> 31:00.080]  liberties and freedoms for more than eight weeks info wars has
[31:00.080 --> 31:03.200]  researched this deadly coronavirus and it is deadly
[31:03.200 --> 31:06.320]  it targets those who already have pre-existing conditions compromise
[31:06.320 --> 31:09.680]  immune systems and those over 70 particularly bad
[31:09.680 --> 31:13.040]  it is deadly but the globalists are hyping it as an economic and
[31:13.040 --> 31:16.960]  psychological warfare weapon to implement martial law and throw trump
[31:16.960 --> 31:20.880]  out of office but regardless the mainstream media will not tell you
[31:20.880 --> 31:23.920]  about natural compounds that are known to be extremely

[33:47.760 --> 33:56.400]  as for me i'm not going along with it
[33:59.200 --> 34:02.320]  i think this is a apt thing to read here is about the news paul joseph
[34:02.320 --> 34:06.640]  watson thomas pain wrote this in the crisis
[34:06.640 --> 34:12.800]  on the eve of the revolutionary war in 1775
[34:12.800 --> 34:18.880]  these are the times that trimon souls the summer soldier and the sunshine
[34:18.880 --> 34:22.800]  patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of their country
[34:22.800 --> 34:26.400]  but he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks
[34:26.400 --> 34:32.640]  of man and woman tyranny like hell is not easily conquered yet we have the
[34:32.640 --> 34:38.800]  consolation with us at the heart of the conflict more glorious the triumph
[34:38.800 --> 34:44.160]  what we obtained to cheat we esteem too lightly it is dearness only that gives
[34:44.160 --> 34:48.800]  everything its value have a dose how to put a proper price upon its
[34:48.800 --> 34:52.000]  goods and it would be strange indeed if so
[34:52.000 --> 35:02.560]  celestial as an article of freedom should not be highly rated
[35:02.640 --> 35:06.720]  paul joseph watson is in the uk where the prime minister has contracted
[35:06.720 --> 35:14.800]  the dreaded woonan chai kham virus those covered 19 politically correct
[35:14.800 --> 35:19.040]  and the police are now roving around saying don't be out in the sun which
[35:19.040 --> 35:22.720]  actually kills covered 19 actually has your body produced vitamin e3
[35:22.720 --> 35:27.040]  even for social distancing this is not a holiday

[35:34.160 --> 35:38.160]  home now and starve to death you scallywag
[35:38.160 --> 35:41.920]  there's a tax on sunlight this was shot in england just
[35:41.920 --> 35:44.320]  yesterday paul joseph was an article about it

[36:18.960 --> 36:23.920]  go home this is north korea gone big time and
[36:23.920 --> 36:28.240]  lest you think that's just the you know mighty
[36:28.240 --> 36:33.120]  oceania airstrip one it's the same thing in austin they're
[36:33.120 --> 36:35.680]  going up the creek so go and get out of there
[36:35.680 --> 36:40.160]  well not the british accent you foolish scum you nave
[36:40.160 --> 36:44.880]  they're doing it in chicago they're doing it in austin texas
[36:44.880 --> 36:48.080]  and the governor and the mayor they're all saying they may just have to close
[36:48.080 --> 36:51.840]  the parks entirely singapore to jail people for six months for standing to
[36:51.840 --> 36:55.120]  close that's a paul joseph was an article and then
[36:55.120 --> 36:59.360]  uk police force creates tool that lets people snitch on others for not
[36:59.360 --> 37:03.760]  social distancing i see them officers in the park
[37:03.760 --> 37:06.960]  one of them one of them is walking the dog
[37:06.960 --> 37:10.960]  ma'am we'll get on us right now thank you they're not
[37:10.960 --> 37:14.480]  behaving though we can roll some b-roll of what happened here in austin
[37:14.480 --> 37:20.880]  evil women are out sunbathing people are riding moped
[37:20.880 --> 37:26.320]  uh they guess who's exempt the illegal aliens and the homeless let's go to paul
[37:26.320 --> 37:32.160]  joseph watson from the uk so much to cover boris johnson's stick in the
[37:32.160 --> 37:36.560]  but but out of cambridge i had a big study out
[37:36.640 --> 37:40.880]  and they were saying that they predicted 50 percent of the uk already has the
[37:40.880 --> 37:45.600]  virus and that its death rate it's pretty low paul what do you think
[37:45.600 --> 37:49.760]  well yeah good to be back Alex they the original epidemiologist do as i advise
[37:49.760 --> 37:54.400]  in the british government said that it would kill worst-case scenario 500
[37:54.400 --> 37:57.920]  thousand brits now he's saying it may kill
[37:57.920 --> 38:01.120]  20 000 probably less but of course as he mentioned
[38:01.120 --> 38:05.280]  now the prime minister becomes the first world leader in the entire globe to
[38:05.280 --> 38:09.200]  have coronavirus probably something to do with it
[38:09.200 --> 38:12.160]  might have been the fact that he was shaking the hands of coronavirus
[38:12.160 --> 38:16.160]  victims in hospital three weeks ago probably not the best idea
[38:16.160 --> 38:21.440]  but in the uk alex let you have trump derangement syndrome we have
[38:21.440 --> 38:26.080]  boris derangement syndrome so we had this big thing last night alex where at
[38:26.080 --> 38:30.800]  8 p.m across the entire country everyone came out on their balconies
[38:30.800 --> 38:34.240]  everybody stuck their head out of the window while in quarantine
[38:34.240 --> 38:41.040]  at 8 p.m in a unified manner to unify the country and mass applauded government
[38:41.040 --> 38:44.800]  health care this is a big story in the news everybody came out and
[38:44.800 --> 38:48.240]  cheered and whooped and hollered for government health care at 8 p.m
[38:48.240 --> 38:51.600]  and it was heralded as this moment of national unity
[38:51.600 --> 38:55.440]  because everybody applauded it so then this morning
[38:55.440 --> 38:59.120]  it turns out that the prime minister the leader of the country in trying to
[38:59.120 --> 39:04.000]  fight coronavirus has coronavirus and this national unity soon
[39:04.000 --> 39:07.760]  disappeared alex because of course the leftists were all over twitter saying
[39:07.760 --> 39:11.360]  thank god it's so funny that he's got coronavirus we love it
[39:11.360 --> 39:15.600]  so that national unity that start with the nhs applauding dissipated very
[39:15.600 --> 39:20.240]  quickly now the chief medical officer of the government's
[39:20.240 --> 39:23.920]  response to coronavirus probably has coronavirus
[39:23.920 --> 39:28.000]  and the health secretary has coronavirus so basically
[39:28.000 --> 39:32.400]  the top three people in the uk on the front lines of fighting the coronavirus
[39:32.400 --> 39:36.960]  or leading the fight against it now all have coronavirus so there's some irony
[39:36.960 --> 39:43.280]  in the alex
[39:43.280 --> 39:46.800]  half the united kingdom already infected with coronavirus says oxford model
[39:46.800 --> 39:50.240]  but again all these models are all over the map but what we do see consistently
[39:50.240 --> 39:54.720]  is the number of dead that they predicted you know two million in the
[39:54.720 --> 39:58.000]  us uh you know millions dead in the uk it's all
[39:58.000 --> 40:01.760]  lowering to now just a tiny fraction of that but still we're told
[40:01.760 --> 40:05.360]  this is the greatest threat humanities ever faced run for the hills we
[40:05.360 --> 40:08.720]  shouldn't reopen the united states the democrats are having to show down with
[40:08.720 --> 40:10.880]  trump say they're going to keep all the areas they
[40:10.880 --> 40:14.080]  have another control close for the foreseeable future what do you make of
[40:14.080 --> 40:18.000]  this well there's an argument to be made that
[40:18.000 --> 40:21.520]  we should have overreacted because then if we didn't we didn't take it seriously
[40:21.520 --> 40:25.280]  it would have been way worse there's a big problem with a lack of ventilators
[40:25.280 --> 40:29.840]  and hospital beds in the uk and in london one hospital already had to
[40:29.840 --> 40:33.760]  declare an emergency because they ran out of beds with ventilators
[40:33.760 --> 40:36.960]  so there is that problem of a rush of new patients
[40:36.960 --> 40:41.520]  then making it people who are already ill not able to get treatment so it is a
[40:41.520 --> 40:44.240]  big problem but again going back to these
[40:44.240 --> 40:49.040]  social distancing measures it's all selectively enforced as you said alex
[40:49.040 --> 40:53.520]  you go into the migrant areas you go into the inner city areas full of urban
[40:53.520 --> 40:56.240]  youth gangs of them still out on the streets nothing
[40:56.240 --> 40:59.760]  happens in the peak district which is a really
[40:59.760 --> 41:03.200]  remote location of the uk near where i used to live
[41:03.200 --> 41:07.680]  they had a police surveillance drone tracking people who were walking their
[41:07.680 --> 41:12.320]  dogs in a field and then they traced back their license plate to find their
[41:12.320 --> 41:16.160]  address put it out on twitter and apparently
[41:16.160 --> 41:19.680]  this is the main threat alex like we're told social distancing you have to
[41:19.680 --> 41:23.440]  stand two meters away from somebody these people there's nobody within like
[41:23.440 --> 41:26.720]  half a mile of them but these are the people who are being
[41:26.720 --> 41:30.960]  shamed on twitter by a major police force in the uk
[41:30.960 --> 41:36.560]  meanwhile in london yesterday that i happened to look outside of my window
[41:36.560 --> 41:40.560]  on a main road in london and a group of youths turned up
[41:40.560 --> 41:45.200]  and decided to have alex a rat battle on the street as they were also pissing in
[41:45.200 --> 41:48.400]  the street a group of six of them on a main road in
[41:48.400 --> 41:50.720]  london and of course nothing whatsoever happened
[41:50.720 --> 41:55.680]  but if you walk your dog in a remote location in the peak district in northern
[41:55.680 --> 41:59.200]  england then you're bad so it's all selectively
[41:59.200 --> 42:02.880]  enforced and that's why it's it's going to become and doesn't the uk see
[42:02.880 --> 42:06.480]  through this where if you're a muslim you literally can rape kill piss
[42:06.480 --> 42:10.160]  advocate stab uh in fact even letting migrants in they're
[42:10.160 --> 42:13.360]  saying right now says europe but if you're a citizen and you're in some
[42:13.360 --> 42:17.360]  super rural remote area climbing a hillside
[42:17.360 --> 42:21.200]  there's a drone shouting oldest get off this mountain you piss
[42:21.200 --> 42:25.440]  with royal it's just they they want to peck on the regular
[42:25.440 --> 42:30.160]  producing taxpayer population yeah because they know that they're the only
[42:30.160 --> 42:32.640]  people who are going to obey this and a lot of people
[42:32.640 --> 42:36.400]  in this country get off on being obedient to the government it kind of gives
[42:36.400 --> 42:40.000]  gives them like a sanctimonious ego boom exactly so there's going to be no
[42:40.000 --> 42:43.120]  end to it muslims will run around raping your daughters and just
[42:43.120 --> 42:47.440]  and then you get the denunciations of your neighbors which we can get into in
[42:47.440 --> 42:51.280]  the next that's right let's talk about that when we return

[47:42.080 --> 47:45.440]  hysteria ongoing despite what noble laureates
[47:45.440 --> 47:48.560]  and the scientists and even the government rating agencies are saying

[47:59.200 --> 48:02.080]  they'll keep people that aren't that sick there just to make the money
[48:02.080 --> 48:04.880]  then when there's a big pandemic they'll rotate those that aren't really
[48:04.880 --> 48:07.680]  that sick out and keep those that are really sick in and they do get
[48:07.680 --> 48:11.600]  overwhelmed sometimes that's what happens in a civilization

[50:50.960 --> 50:54.480]  this go in your article about singapore and china being the model but
[50:54.480 --> 50:58.720]  what about the spectacle we're already seeing unfold of the democrats
[50:58.720 --> 51:00.880]  and the showdown with trump they're just saying they're going to keep things
[51:00.880 --> 51:03.040]  close for months and months and months and months
[51:03.040 --> 51:07.440]  some say 18 months the democrats will be reasonable just through the election
[51:07.440 --> 51:10.000]  how crazy is this going to get when trump's trying to
[51:10.000 --> 51:14.960]  turn things back on well they've obviously turned it around and are now
[51:14.960 --> 51:18.880]  exploiting it for political purposes even though
[51:18.880 --> 51:23.040]  it was the leftist the democrats and the media right at the start when you and i
[51:23.040 --> 51:26.240]  alex are saying no this is serious we need to pay attention we need to close
[51:26.240 --> 51:28.800]  the borders we need to have travel restrictions
[51:28.800 --> 51:34.000]  back in january in february you had the new york health commissioner
[51:34.000 --> 51:37.520]  and you had the chair of the new york council health committee
[51:37.520 --> 51:42.720]  both saying everybody needs to come out and congregate in this large group to
[51:42.720 --> 51:47.440]  celebrate the chinese new year this is on february 9th
[51:47.440 --> 51:50.800]  they were saying it's racist to not go to chinese restaurants
[51:50.800 --> 51:55.040]  it's racist not to want to go to china town and be around
[51:55.040 --> 51:59.040]  thousands of people some of whom have probably just come back from china
[51:59.040 --> 52:04.000]  this this was new york health officials on february 9 saying this
[52:04.000 --> 52:10.400]  lest we forget alex on january 14th the world health organization said
[52:10.400 --> 52:14.880]  there's no evidence of human to human transmission of covet 19
[52:14.880 --> 52:19.280]  they amplified word for word what the communist chinese government was
[52:19.280 --> 52:23.040]  telling them meanwhile the mainstream media
[52:23.040 --> 52:27.040]  is putting out headlines like buzzfeed don't worry about the coronavirus
[52:27.040 --> 52:30.560]  worry about the flu washington post get a grip america
[52:30.560 --> 52:33.920]  the flu is a much bigger threat than coronavirus for now
[52:33.920 --> 52:37.840]  cnn a deadly virus is spreading from state to state and has infected 19
[52:37.840 --> 52:42.240]  million americans it's influenza so the people saying
[52:42.240 --> 52:46.080]  right at the start in january it's just the flu bro
[52:46.080 --> 52:49.920]  that wasn't us that was the mainstream media that was the leftist health
[52:49.920 --> 52:53.760]  officials in new york city so now for them to point the
[52:53.760 --> 52:57.920]  finger at people like others doesn't say oh how dare you say that this is being
[52:57.920 --> 53:02.560]  politically manipulated or that this isn't as alarmist and hysterical as
[53:02.560 --> 53:07.120]  we demand you accept it to be those are the same people who in january
[53:07.120 --> 53:11.120]  said it's just the flu bro oh but now you know you can trust them
[53:11.120 --> 53:14.560]  no and paul we saw the same thing in leptis cities in idly hug of chinese
[53:14.560 --> 53:18.400]  while it was spreading and then we saw the cdc shipping thousands in that they
[53:18.400 --> 53:21.280]  knew had it and distributing around the country while telling trump everything
[53:21.280 --> 53:24.640]  was okay and then we have biden saying it's xenophobic to
[53:24.640 --> 53:28.480]  block the airline flight seven weeks ago and now they turn around and say every
[53:28.480 --> 53:31.920]  death is trumps fault can you do one of your viral videos where you show all the
[53:31.920 --> 53:36.800]  proof of you know proof democrats uh you know uh told us to stand down for
[53:36.800 --> 53:40.880]  coronavirus now blaming trump or maybe an article that just shows because there's
[53:40.880 --> 53:45.600]  dozens of examples and now they flip the whole thing around
[53:45.600 --> 53:48.560]  exactly the world health organization said
[53:48.560 --> 53:53.520]  january we reiterate our call to all countries not to impose travel restrictions
[53:53.520 --> 53:56.880]  such restrictions can have the effect of increasing fear and stigma
[53:56.880 --> 54:00.240]  which means racism basically they said that in january they said it on
[54:00.240 --> 54:04.240]  february 4th by the way the hug this is the video you're playing
[54:04.240 --> 54:08.240]  now the hug a chinese guy in florence and across italy
[54:08.240 --> 54:12.160]  and in some cases literally removing his face mask and almost kissing him
[54:12.160 --> 54:15.680]  okay that was in florence it was elsewhere in the country but the mayor of
[54:15.680 --> 54:20.320]  florence promoted it meanwhile in a town called prato
[54:20.320 --> 54:25.760]  a few miles from florence you had 50 000 chinese immigrants working in the
[54:25.760 --> 54:29.200]  textile industry many of them illegal immigrants
[54:29.200 --> 54:32.000]  making products so they could claim that they were
[54:32.000 --> 54:35.200]  made in italy when in fact they were made from slave labor
[54:35.200 --> 54:41.520]  imported often illegally from china so you had 50 000 in that one town alone
[54:41.520 --> 54:45.520]  tens of thousands in other towns in northern italy potentially infected
[54:45.520 --> 54:48.720]  and the left-wing mayor of florence is telling italians
[54:48.720 --> 54:53.520]  to go out and hug and kiss these people he's literally doing stunts where he's
[54:53.520 --> 54:56.400]  doing it himself oh but where to blame him
[54:56.400 --> 55:00.480]  well i gotta say it my cat is on this show
[55:00.480 --> 55:03.440]  was the first guy to really raise the alarm and i agreed with him
[55:03.440 --> 55:08.000]  that clearly the democrats knew it was bad they were saying it wasn't dangerous
[55:08.000 --> 55:11.520]  to make sure it got here trump bought into that because fouchy told him don't
[55:11.520 --> 55:15.200]  worry back then he then did want to scare people he said well it might kill
[55:15.200 --> 55:19.040]  some folks but it'll be okay then they flipped and said it's all your fault
[55:19.040 --> 55:22.160]  we knew that was coming warned trump so then he did
[55:22.160 --> 55:26.240]  respond now though he understands if we over panic it'll be too far
[55:26.240 --> 55:29.520]  which is the democrats plan again all along this has been a very
[55:29.520 --> 55:34.000]  scripted setup paul well yeah which is why i've said
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.560]  you know the media went from it's just the flu blowing
[55:36.560 --> 55:41.840]  bro in january to hysterical alarmism in march and they did it in january they
[55:41.840 --> 55:45.040]  did that in january to protect china now they're doing the hysterical
[55:45.040 --> 55:49.200]  alarmism in march to protect trump i don't think the truth is any of those
[55:49.200 --> 55:52.320]  two extremes yes i think it's really bad but as he said the
[55:52.320 --> 55:56.320]  the cure for it could be worse than the virus itself with this mass panic
[55:56.320 --> 56:01.120]  shutting off society for months on end and then we'll get into the denunciations
[56:01.120 --> 56:04.480]  after the break but yeah they they literally had
[56:04.480 --> 56:08.960]  tens of thousands of chinese migrants in these northern italian towns and the
[56:08.960 --> 56:11.840]  left-wing political leaders were saying go out and hug them
[56:11.840 --> 56:17.200]  or your racists meanwhile singapore and russia closed their border
[56:17.200 --> 56:21.520]  at the end of january so all chinese travelers and everyone else for that
[56:21.520 --> 56:26.640]  matter less than two this is both countries combined as of today
[56:26.640 --> 56:30.720]  less than 2000 cases of coronavirus only six deaths
[56:30.720 --> 56:36.320]  in russia and singapore combined meanwhile you the source of the chinese
[56:36.320 --> 56:40.560]  virus in italy northern italy was two chinese tourists
[56:40.560 --> 56:43.840]  who visited rome and then you had those tens of thousands of illegal immigrants
[56:43.840 --> 56:47.600]  who were spreading it as well you can look at hong kong alex
[56:47.600 --> 56:51.840]  still to this day you know hong kong special administrative region but it's
[56:51.840 --> 56:58.240]  in china four deaths only 518 cases because they quarantined
[56:58.240 --> 57:02.160]  everyone arriving from china from the start of february
[57:02.160 --> 57:08.080]  you still have flights landing right now at jfk airport from rome you have
[57:08.080 --> 57:11.200]  flights landing right now at heathrow airport london
[57:11.200 --> 57:14.640]  from rome and in fact from iran and all these other countries
[57:14.640 --> 57:19.840]  with zero checks even to this day and the democrats are calling for that to be
[57:19.840 --> 57:22.800]  open but that we can't leave and walk the dog at the park
[57:22.800 --> 57:25.920]  literally they're saying don't go to the park
[57:25.920 --> 57:29.040]  but the borders stay wide open and the flights stay wide open
[57:29.040 --> 57:33.200]  and and trump's not even hammering that home he needs ads exposing them
[57:33.200 --> 57:36.560]  or they're going to try to hold the country hostage in blaming on him
[57:36.560 --> 57:40.320]  this is bigger than trump folks they want to kill the u.s economy the global
[57:40.320 --> 57:43.040]  has lost their trade war this is their counter strike
[57:43.040 --> 57:46.240]  we'll be back hour two more with paul joseph watson then your calls are coming
[57:46.240 --> 57:49.680]  up stay with us there is a paradox
[57:49.680 --> 57:53.200]  yes this virus is deadly and does kill people
[57:53.200 --> 57:56.640]  and so do many other countless viruses that have already
[57:56.640 --> 58:02.880]  existed that do exist and will exist but when trump says the cure is worse than
[58:02.880 --> 58:06.960]  disease he's talking about the media hype
[58:06.960 --> 58:11.280]  creating hysteria and trying to create uncertainty
[58:11.280 --> 58:15.840]  and it is that that i oppose it is not the american way
[58:15.840 --> 58:21.440]  to cower and live in fear and to follow the edicts and precedents
[58:21.440 --> 58:25.360]  set by communist china and hyper authoritarian
[58:25.360 --> 58:29.200]  singapore where you're now being given six months in jail
[58:29.200 --> 58:33.520]  if you don't stand at least six feet away from someone
[58:33.520 --> 58:37.200]  this is being used by social engineers and they admit
[58:37.200 --> 58:41.360]  that they are trying to transform our world forever into something
[58:41.360 --> 58:46.640]  unrecognizable from what it's been we are not slaves and we must not act like
[58:46.640 --> 58:49.040]  it
[58:49.040 --> 58:55.120]  serving with info wars is a great honor but i still need my morning coffee

[59:47.760 --> 59:57.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:00:09.360 --> 1:00:13.280]  people want to work they want to go back they have to go back
[1:00:13.280 --> 1:00:16.880]  and uh we're going to be talking about dates
[1:00:16.880 --> 1:00:20.800]  we're going to be talking with a lot of great professionals
[1:00:20.800 --> 1:00:24.480]  but this is a country that was built on
[1:00:24.480 --> 1:00:28.160]  getting it done and our people want to go back to work i'm hearing
[1:00:28.160 --> 1:00:31.600]  i'm hearing it loud and clear
[1:00:33.120 --> 1:00:42.160]  tcb baby taking care of business every day every way make no mistake
[1:00:42.160 --> 1:00:45.120]  we were very concerned eight nine weeks ago because the virus was man-made
[1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:49.520]  that's confirmed people said well it must be ultra deadly it was man-made no
[1:00:49.520 --> 1:00:53.360]  that's so they could follow the trajectory of it and knew it only hit
[1:00:53.360 --> 1:00:56.320]  certain populations would still really scare people
[1:00:56.320 --> 1:00:59.760]  and overwhelm things it's like the 223 or 556 round
[1:00:59.760 --> 1:01:03.680]  in vietnam was so they could carry more of it was high velocity would go through
[1:01:03.680 --> 1:01:06.560]  body armor but also had a tendency to really wound
[1:01:06.560 --> 1:01:10.320]  people very bad and then that would take more energy for the vietnam to take
[1:01:10.320 --> 1:01:13.360]  care of those folks at least that was one of the theories well
[1:01:13.360 --> 1:01:19.200]  this is a soft kill weapon and you could argue that it got out of a weapons lab
[1:01:19.200 --> 1:01:21.280]  but we know it was from a weapons lab
[1:01:21.280 --> 1:01:26.640]  paul joseph watson's here with us this segment the next from summit dot news
[1:01:26.640 --> 1:01:30.960]  paul i want to ask you in this short segment
[1:01:30.960 --> 1:01:34.240]  next segment we'll get into the social distancing and the tattletale squats
[1:01:34.240 --> 1:01:38.560]  how are you handling it what is london like right now
[1:01:38.560 --> 1:01:45.440]  for you um it's not very much different the only thing i've noticed is
[1:01:45.440 --> 1:01:50.320]  well you know when i go out for my stay allowed one exercise session a day
[1:01:50.320 --> 1:01:53.280]  go running in the park i live right next to a park
[1:01:53.280 --> 1:01:57.840]  you'll notice people they do practice this social distancing thing some don't
[1:01:57.840 --> 1:02:01.120]  i mean within reason you have to stay away from people but some take it too
[1:02:01.120 --> 1:02:04.960]  far like you i can be running in a straight line and
[1:02:04.960 --> 1:02:09.120]  obviously i'm avoiding somebody by about two meters and they're walking in a
[1:02:09.120 --> 1:02:11.920]  straight line towards me mainly older people
[1:02:11.920 --> 1:02:15.440]  and then suddenly they catch your eye and they only see you at the last minute
[1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:18.480]  even though you like two meters apart and they suddenly like
[1:02:18.480 --> 1:02:22.400]  swerve and panic and it's like dude if you're that worried
[1:02:22.400 --> 1:02:26.320]  about getting corona virus why are you out in the park
[1:02:26.320 --> 1:02:30.320]  like if you're reacting to me like i'm a zombie trying to attack you
[1:02:30.320 --> 1:02:35.040]  like why are you even outside at this point so you get a lot of people shouting at
[1:02:35.040 --> 1:02:39.200]  people and saying this is not a holiday do not lay out and enjoy yourselves
[1:02:39.200 --> 1:02:44.720]  they should be saying lay out vitamin d we know stops viruses
[1:02:44.720 --> 1:02:48.560]  well yeah it kills the family of flu viruses doesn't it i mean
[1:02:48.560 --> 1:02:52.000]  the law is more than two people they can disperse it
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:55.840]  most of the time you see people sitting down sunbathing it's
[1:02:55.840 --> 1:02:59.840]  it's two people and a dog or it's a family so i mean again it's all going to
[1:02:59.840 --> 1:03:03.680]  be selectively enforced how dare them
[1:03:03.680 --> 1:03:06.720]  yeah and then if you look if you look at the reports out of paris and some of
[1:03:06.720 --> 1:03:10.000]  these other no-go areas the police show up
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:13.680]  they try to disperse large groups of migrants
[1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:16.880]  and then just more of them turn up intimidate the police
[1:03:16.880 --> 1:03:20.560]  and in some cases if the police then don't leave they start coughing on the
[1:03:20.560 --> 1:03:22.240]  police oh yeah i've seen the footage where they
[1:03:22.240 --> 1:03:25.520]  cough on them burn cars run around screaming but that's okay
[1:03:25.520 --> 1:03:29.200]  because that's their culture yeah yeah they're they're completely
[1:03:29.200 --> 1:03:32.640]  immune from these measures so again it's all going to be selectively enforced
[1:03:32.640 --> 1:03:35.120]  but then and we can get into it after the break
[1:03:35.120 --> 1:03:38.480]  you do have this tattle tale mentality in
[1:03:38.480 --> 1:03:43.120]  britain where people literally think that it's their act of courage
[1:03:43.120 --> 1:03:46.000]  like they're akin to being on the front lines of a
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:50.400]  coronavirus stricken hospital like a doctor saving people's lives
[1:03:50.400 --> 1:03:54.880]  if they can look at like three people sat on a bit of grass sunbathing
[1:03:54.880 --> 1:03:58.480]  and then call the police on them because we've become such an atomized
[1:03:58.480 --> 1:04:03.040]  society that generally in the big cities people either completely ignore
[1:04:03.040 --> 1:04:07.360]  their neighbors or hate them so as soon as they get a chance to
[1:04:07.360 --> 1:04:11.120]  use the powers of the state to crack down on their neighbors who might be
[1:04:11.120 --> 1:04:14.560]  having a barbecue in their back garden with four or five people
[1:04:14.560 --> 1:04:18.560]  they're gonna use it alex don't don't worry about that they're gonna use it
[1:04:18.560 --> 1:04:23.040]  and i think that's what we're gonna see uh red cross is also saying civil unrest
[1:04:23.040 --> 1:04:26.640]  within about three weeks in disadvantaged neighborhoods so we got
[1:04:26.640 --> 1:04:30.800]  that to look forward to as well unbelievable and what happens is more
[1:04:30.800 --> 1:04:33.680]  of these businesses shut down everywhere there's a lot of them never
[1:04:33.680 --> 1:04:36.880]  coming back all for a virus the globalese killed
[1:04:36.880 --> 1:04:40.640]  less than the flu kills each year in the united states all those of wastes with
[1:04:40.640 --> 1:04:45.920]  summit dot news really envious of that side he's got powerful amazing uh
[1:04:45.920 --> 1:04:50.480]  we're gonna update info or someday it'll be like summit someday
[1:04:50.480 --> 1:04:59.280]  we'll be right back stay with us
[1:04:59.280 --> 1:05:04.560]  listen there's a show from pbs called it's okay to be smart
[1:05:04.560 --> 1:05:08.800]  so everyone who's been smart and has been put down for it
[1:05:08.800 --> 1:05:14.240]  and persecuted it's okay to finally be smart that's right there's not two
[1:05:14.240 --> 1:05:18.720]  sexes and and families are bad and the right thing to do is to sterilize your
[1:05:18.720 --> 1:05:21.760]  son so he knows we got an evil warm hunger i mean a lot of feminists are
[1:05:21.760 --> 1:05:24.960]  saying we should have the government pass laws that mail embryos account
[1:05:24.960 --> 1:05:29.040]  but what's better and more reformed and more humanitarian is just to convince
[1:05:29.040 --> 1:05:32.400]  them when they're five years old to have their testicles chopped off
[1:05:32.400 --> 1:05:35.760]  and again global warming is real we got to pay lord raffschild all our money
[1:05:35.760 --> 1:05:38.960]  and the pandemic's all real we've got to be locked up in our houses we've got to
[1:05:38.960 --> 1:05:43.040]  use the language the university say we're not a culture anything
[1:05:43.040 --> 1:05:47.840]  oh no no we're not we're good people we're good people that went to these
[1:05:47.840 --> 1:05:52.880]  corporate systems that didn't brainwash us no no they enlightened us how to
[1:05:52.880 --> 1:05:56.960]  censor and how to rule and out of control
[1:06:00.320 --> 1:06:03.840]  live from the info wars global corona crisis studios
[1:06:03.840 --> 1:06:12.800]  in austin texas under lockdown to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex
[1:06:12.800 --> 1:06:16.480]  jones show and we're playing escape from new york
[1:06:16.480 --> 1:06:20.160]  music here and it's very fitting texas orders 14-day quarantine
[1:06:20.160 --> 1:06:23.600]  for new york new jersey connecticut and new orleans which have almost all the
[1:06:23.600 --> 1:06:26.480]  cases in the united states you really believe it's that deadly that's
[1:06:26.480 --> 1:06:29.520]  reasonable quarantine the folks that actually have it
[1:06:29.520 --> 1:06:32.880]  don't tell counties with zero cases you can't leave your house
[1:06:32.880 --> 1:06:36.720]  and trump's got a plan i'll cover after paul watson leaves this next segment
[1:06:36.720 --> 1:06:40.720]  taxi county by county put out guidelines and you can get the federal law change
[1:06:40.720 --> 1:06:44.800]  real quick states are following uh so the left doesn't hold cities and counties
[1:06:44.800 --> 1:06:49.440]  hostage that don't have a problem but right now speaking of boris johnson
[1:06:49.440 --> 1:06:54.720]  he has contracted covid-19 oxford has a study out they believe half the
[1:06:54.720 --> 1:06:58.000]  public already had it but they're hiding those numbers they want to keep the
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:02.560]  hysteria going here's boris johnson
[1:07:02.560 --> 1:07:05.680]  hi folks i want to bring you up to speed with something that's happening today
[1:07:05.680 --> 1:07:10.640]  which is that i've developed mild symptoms of the coronavirus that's to
[1:07:10.640 --> 1:07:14.800]  say a temperature and a persistent cough
[1:07:14.800 --> 1:07:18.160]  and on the advice of the chief medical officer i've
[1:07:18.160 --> 1:07:22.160]  taken a test that has come out positive so
[1:07:22.160 --> 1:07:26.160]  i am working from home i'm self isolating
[1:07:26.160 --> 1:07:30.640]  and that's entirely the right thing to do uh but
[1:07:30.640 --> 1:07:34.080]  be in no doubt that i can continue thanks to the wizardry of modern
[1:07:34.080 --> 1:07:38.960]  technology to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fight back
[1:07:38.960 --> 1:07:42.560]  against coronavirus so i want to thank everybody okay so there you go not
[1:07:42.560 --> 1:07:45.760]  hysteria not into the world he was like trump tried to play it now but then it
[1:07:45.760 --> 1:07:47.680]  got caught up in the frenzy because if you don't
[1:07:47.680 --> 1:07:51.200]  then it's all your fault this is really the public's fault buying into the
[1:07:51.200 --> 1:07:55.280]  hysteria uh in in my view but paul speaking of british prime ministers
[1:07:55.280 --> 1:07:59.840]  gordon brown came out called for global government
[1:07:59.840 --> 1:08:03.680]  only global government he said can stop global crises well that's right out of
[1:08:03.680 --> 1:08:08.080]  globalist think tank let out scenario or virus outbreak prompts authoritarian
[1:08:08.080 --> 1:08:15.760]  crackdown that was the rockefeller foundation in 2010 scenario narrative
[1:08:15.760 --> 1:08:20.160]  lockstep how a global lockdown will make the world lockstep that's that's
[1:08:20.160 --> 1:08:22.720]  quotes with the global government paul so
[1:08:22.720 --> 1:08:26.800]  there they are telling you what they're doing yeah despite the fact that
[1:08:26.800 --> 1:08:30.320]  globalism caused this because they refuse to shut down the
[1:08:30.320 --> 1:08:34.480]  sacred international flow of people for months and months and months but now
[1:08:34.480 --> 1:08:38.240]  they're trying to exploit it by giving the who
[1:08:38.240 --> 1:08:42.160]  executive powers which would crush national sovereignty
[1:08:42.160 --> 1:08:45.840]  even though it was the who on january 14 saying
[1:08:45.840 --> 1:08:49.280]  don't worry this is fine there's no human to human transmission we can trust
[1:08:49.280 --> 1:08:52.880]  china they're the people they want to give executive powers over your country
[1:08:52.880 --> 1:08:58.080]  probably not the other thing is in taiwan for example alex
[1:08:58.080 --> 1:09:02.240]  they now have it what loaded onto people's phones where if they're suspected
[1:09:02.240 --> 1:09:05.040]  to have been exposed to corona virus
[1:09:05.040 --> 1:09:09.600]  their phone then pings out their location continuously
[1:09:09.600 --> 1:09:13.360]  and if they're on house arrest as is the case in many countries
[1:09:13.360 --> 1:09:16.720]  and in one case this guy's phone ran out of battery
[1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:21.360]  his phone was off for like three hours before he plugged it back in again the
[1:09:21.360 --> 1:09:25.600]  police were knocking on his door saying have you violated your quarantine
[1:09:25.600 --> 1:09:28.800]  that's in taiwan that's not even china that's supposedly more
[1:09:28.800 --> 1:09:32.400]  you know liberal country where that's happening so
[1:09:32.400 --> 1:09:35.680]  again it you know as edward snowden warns these powers even if they're
[1:09:35.680 --> 1:09:38.800]  legitimate now they won't end the nature of
[1:09:38.800 --> 1:09:42.480]  governments is to keep these powers on the books and then use them in the
[1:09:42.480 --> 1:09:45.680]  background and then that ties into the snitch
[1:09:45.680 --> 1:09:50.400]  society um earlier today my friend texted me and said i'm
[1:09:50.400 --> 1:09:53.440]  having a barbeque he's got a little back guard and you
[1:09:53.440 --> 1:09:55.840]  know four or five people you want to come over
[1:09:55.840 --> 1:10:00.160]  i'm like dude you know that your neighbor will report you to the police like
[1:10:00.160 --> 1:10:03.760]  it's almost guaranteed that she will report you to the police
[1:10:03.760 --> 1:10:08.960]  which has already happened in the united kingdom and indeed in spain
[1:10:08.960 --> 1:10:11.680]  where two brothers i think they were kid brothers
[1:10:11.680 --> 1:10:15.120]  were playing soccer out in their own backyard
[1:10:15.120 --> 1:10:19.680]  the neighbor looks out the window and calls the police the police come and
[1:10:19.680 --> 1:10:24.400]  break up this dangerous gathering of two kids playing soccer in their backyard
[1:10:24.400 --> 1:10:28.640]  so that's the way it's going because in the united kingdom
[1:10:28.640 --> 1:10:33.440]  not only do we have the like criminal thug underclass the droogs
[1:10:33.440 --> 1:10:36.400]  we also have like a nation of curtain twitches
[1:10:36.400 --> 1:10:39.520]  who have nothing to do with their lives so their entire
[1:10:39.520 --> 1:10:43.440]  life purpose becomes around patrolling what other people can do
[1:10:43.440 --> 1:10:47.040]  you know alex this is how they get personal validation
[1:10:47.040 --> 1:10:51.280]  from this like do good to behavior of grassing other people up and thinking
[1:10:51.280 --> 1:10:54.640]  that they're on the front lines of fighting coronavirus like a doctor or
[1:10:54.640 --> 1:10:57.600]  whatever so they're going to get the chance now
[1:10:57.600 --> 1:11:02.400]  to satiate this control freak impulse that they've been begging to do for
[1:11:02.400 --> 1:11:07.040]  their entire lives because our society as i said before the break
[1:11:07.040 --> 1:11:11.200]  is atomized now people not only don't talk to their neighbors
[1:11:11.200 --> 1:11:15.040]  they hate their neighbors so every time that they hate their neighbors because
[1:11:15.040 --> 1:11:18.800]  they had a party or because they had a barbecue in that backyard
[1:11:18.800 --> 1:11:23.200]  and made too much noise now if they do that the neighbor gets the chance to
[1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:26.640]  call the police and have the power of the you should go over there and have the
[1:11:26.640 --> 1:11:30.000]  barbecue when the police show up and the stupid social
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:33.440]  distancing they say 10 people here i guess they're saying two there just say
[1:11:33.440 --> 1:11:36.080]  we're a family we live here i mean people need to start
[1:11:36.080 --> 1:11:39.840]  pushing back like the islamicist i mean at least the islamicist
[1:11:39.840 --> 1:11:43.040]  when they have drag queen story time and try to reach five-year-olds how to give
[1:11:43.040 --> 1:11:46.400]  oral blow jobs seriously in the uk the muslims come out and
[1:11:46.400 --> 1:11:50.560]  protested and it gets canceled so in a way do i have to convert to islam
[1:11:50.560 --> 1:11:54.640]  to you know so that they won't teach my kids how to be prostitutes
[1:11:54.640 --> 1:11:58.080]  well that that's the point they can't enforce any of this
[1:11:58.080 --> 1:12:01.440]  minutes after these lockdown measures were announced
[1:12:01.440 --> 1:12:05.760]  via the prime minister the head of the police is literally on the on the news
[1:12:05.760 --> 1:12:09.680]  saying we don't have the facilities to enforce this this is completely
[1:12:09.680 --> 1:12:13.520]  pointless and as i've said before part of this
[1:12:13.520 --> 1:12:17.280]  is because for the last 15 20 years the police in this country
[1:12:17.280 --> 1:12:21.200]  you know you look at spain you look at italy people fear those police because
[1:12:21.200 --> 1:12:24.480]  they're they're strong they're buff they're mean they're you know it's
[1:12:24.480 --> 1:12:27.520]  not always for the best reason but they're feared
[1:12:27.520 --> 1:12:31.440]  in the uk it's like benny hill you know they're all fat and running around
[1:12:31.440 --> 1:12:34.480]  after mad people on the street with knives failing
[1:12:34.480 --> 1:12:38.080]  because for the past 20 years through political correctness the police have
[1:12:38.080 --> 1:12:42.000]  been completely emasculated to the point where criminals
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:45.600]  now just laugh at them because as of recently they weren't
[1:12:45.600 --> 1:12:49.920]  even able to chase criminals on mopeds who were like stealing
[1:12:49.920 --> 1:12:53.280]  people and stabbing people on the street if the criminal
[1:12:53.280 --> 1:12:57.520]  wasn't wearing a helmet because it was like oh poor baby he might fall off his
[1:12:57.520 --> 1:13:01.040]  bike and hurt himself so the police not through their own
[1:13:01.040 --> 1:13:04.800]  fault but through top-down political political correct control
[1:13:04.800 --> 1:13:11.360]  are so um so made fun of and so emasculated because of what came
[1:13:11.360 --> 1:13:15.760]  from central government that they just got no respect nobody respects them so
[1:13:15.760 --> 1:13:19.040]  they're not going to be able to enforce any of this and they're not going to
[1:13:19.040 --> 1:13:23.120]  enforce it in any of the area by the way when i was in spain i went to that
[1:13:23.120 --> 1:13:27.200]  famous uh in um madrid no it wasn't madrid it was in
[1:13:27.200 --> 1:13:30.160]  barcelona i went to that famous cathedral that gaudi
[1:13:30.160 --> 1:13:35.760]  cathedrals you know the artist is gaudi and we just have a camera
[1:13:35.760 --> 1:13:39.120]  videotaping it and the police are anti-terrorism you've got to erase
[1:13:39.120 --> 1:13:43.040]  you uh you you've got to erase that and so they erased our footage
[1:13:43.040 --> 1:13:47.040]  but then at night the muslims are running around robbing people
[1:13:47.040 --> 1:13:51.680]  while we were watching off our balcony it's just like crazy
[1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:55.840]  no and that's what we've seen i've put videos about there's literally a video
[1:13:55.840 --> 1:14:00.160]  from napels in italy where the migrants are just roaming around the streets
[1:14:00.160 --> 1:14:03.600]  below screaming at each other the people are filming them above from their
[1:14:03.600 --> 1:14:06.240]  apartment blocks quarantined and shouting at them
[1:14:06.240 --> 1:14:10.240]  get inside police are nowhere to be seen we've seen the same thing out of
[1:14:10.240 --> 1:14:13.200]  france where they arrested the guy and suddenly there's
[1:14:13.200 --> 1:14:17.360]  25 migrants surrounding the police car they're not going to do anything it's
[1:14:17.360 --> 1:14:20.400]  all selectively enforced meanwhile in spain
[1:14:20.400 --> 1:14:24.720]  my parents went together in the car to the supermarket to buy food
[1:14:24.720 --> 1:14:27.760]  they said no you can only have one person in the car
[1:14:27.760 --> 1:14:32.720]  because they've got checkpoints telling old age pensioners that they can't go to
[1:14:32.720 --> 1:14:36.160]  the shops together as a husband and wife couple
[1:14:36.160 --> 1:14:40.160]  so that's who it's going to be enforced against and our more unruly
[1:14:40.160 --> 1:14:43.840]  demographics alex are gonna gonna get away scot-free not much and what if
[1:14:43.840 --> 1:14:46.640]  you're an old person that needs help going to the store i mean
[1:14:46.640 --> 1:14:51.040]  but but notice first it's only some shops then it's then it's 10 people then
[1:14:51.040 --> 1:14:53.440]  it's two people then if you can't leave your house
[1:14:53.440 --> 1:14:57.920]  they're just seeing what they can get away with paul it's disgusting
[1:14:57.920 --> 1:15:01.200]  yeah and it's it's strange because in jordan at the beginning they actually
[1:15:01.200 --> 1:15:04.560]  said nobody can leave their house for any reason
[1:15:04.560 --> 1:15:08.080]  and they had to get the army to deliver bread and water
[1:15:08.080 --> 1:15:10.800]  to everybody's house because they couldn't even go out to buy so it's about
[1:15:10.800 --> 1:15:14.240]  making you dependent it's all about making you dependent
[1:15:14.240 --> 1:15:18.240]  yeah and it's it's only going to get worse despite what happens with this
[1:15:18.240 --> 1:15:21.680]  coronavirus the amount of deaths i think they'll continue to crank up the
[1:15:21.680 --> 1:15:24.960]  social distancing to see how much they can get away that's right it's a total

[1:20:41.280 --> 1:20:47.280]  here we are my friends
[1:20:47.280 --> 1:20:52.960]  another one of the soulless hollywood androids
[1:20:52.960 --> 1:21:00.160]  after michael rapaport calls for little effing baron trump to be exposed to
[1:21:00.160 --> 1:21:08.160]  corona virus yeah that drug addict son
[1:21:08.160 --> 1:21:15.360]  of the fondad dad the brother of jane he he died natural causes
[1:21:15.360 --> 1:21:19.120]  pretty soon after he called for baron to be gang raped
[1:21:19.120 --> 1:21:25.440]  in a cage and again it was obama put them in more like cages because that's
[1:21:25.440 --> 1:21:28.480]  all they had and you can't just let kids go unaccompanied into the country
[1:21:28.480 --> 1:21:32.160]  obama later lifted it and we've the washington post senate reports that
[1:21:32.160 --> 1:21:36.000]  thousands of children were sex traffic that obama ordered released but trump
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:39.760]  by then had built better facilities better than most public schools
[1:21:39.760 --> 1:21:45.120]  they gave tours remember the squad went down there and said they
[1:21:45.120 --> 1:21:49.600]  saw children drinking out of toilets no they didn't there's a sink
[1:21:49.600 --> 1:21:53.840]  on the top of the toilet it's built in one unit
[1:21:54.800 --> 1:21:59.440]  totally different but you see they blame trump for what they do and i'm not
[1:21:59.440 --> 1:22:02.880]  just here defending trump it's crazy how every time
[1:22:02.880 --> 1:22:07.760]  what they say trump did they did
[1:22:09.040 --> 1:22:12.640]  all trumps been doing is delivering on like 95 percent of what he said
[1:22:12.640 --> 1:22:18.000]  it's crazy i mean all i can say is you imagine if he wasn't there right now
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  you imagine if he loses in 220 days from a from fraud
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:25.840]  or they cancel the election i mean this we're in perilous times and i don't say
[1:22:25.840 --> 1:22:29.360]  that's scary i say it because you need to be engaged and
[1:22:29.360 --> 1:22:32.800]  involved and i'm not bitching at you i'm saying that to myself i'm up there seven
[1:22:32.800 --> 1:22:36.160]  days a week right now because everything we do has
[1:22:36.160 --> 1:22:39.360]  triple the effect quadruple the effect ten times the effect
[1:22:39.360 --> 1:22:42.880]  20 times right now we're in that moment of flux
[1:22:42.880 --> 1:22:45.760]  deciding the future and the globalists know it and they're scared
[1:22:45.760 --> 1:22:52.160]  they did this virus hype out of fear they're losing control
[1:22:53.040 --> 1:22:56.880]  the democrats are everywhere they've had now 10 governors i saw this morning
[1:22:56.880 --> 1:23:03.040]  have ordered all democrats that no doctor prescribe hydroxy
[1:23:03.040 --> 1:23:06.800]  chloroquine because doctors can prescribe stuff that's off medication
[1:23:06.800 --> 1:23:09.840]  trump passed the law saying they could do that too
[1:23:09.840 --> 1:23:14.320]  europe had a great effects with it but i mean they're the government saying
[1:23:14.320 --> 1:23:17.680]  trump says it's great he says there might be side effects but it's at least
[1:23:17.680 --> 1:23:21.520]  something you know it's something that has 90 plus percent cure rate and they
[1:23:21.520 --> 1:23:24.400]  don't want that they tell you doctors don't promote
[1:23:24.400 --> 1:23:27.440]  vitamin c they tell them don't promote zinc
[1:23:27.440 --> 1:23:31.440]  because it's not been approved what the hell does that mean
[1:23:31.440 --> 1:23:35.280]  it's like if you're a diver and the and the and the dive master teaching you
[1:23:35.280 --> 1:23:38.640]  we're about to go down now to 20 feet
[1:23:38.640 --> 1:23:42.320]  you need this regulator and you need the oxygen to live
[1:23:42.320 --> 1:23:46.160]  and all of a sudden the FDA says are you a doctor you don't know you need that
[1:23:46.160 --> 1:23:51.360]  oxygen to live breathe water into your lungs
[1:23:51.360 --> 1:23:56.400]  you're not a doctor trump shut your mouth
[1:23:56.400 --> 1:23:59.280]  meanwhile california passed the law you can give somebody hiv your
[1:23:59.280 --> 1:24:03.760]  hepatitis if you're gay and pedophilia the same senator
[1:24:03.760 --> 1:24:08.000]  has introduced a bill to make it pedophilia legal if it's
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:12.720]  if it's gay if it's same sex man these people are out of control
[1:24:12.720 --> 1:24:16.240]  and you look at the cities they run their piles of feces and needles
[1:24:16.240 --> 1:24:20.080]  and and and desperateness because that's what evil flourishes in
[1:24:20.080 --> 1:24:24.720]  is in darkness so actor mike rubberport has
[1:24:24.720 --> 1:24:29.040]  savagely attacked me before said he wants to you know that i'm ugly
[1:24:29.040 --> 1:24:35.040]  that i'm evil that he's so glad i'm being censored can you imagine being a
[1:24:35.040 --> 1:24:40.160]  biological android like this guy a meat suit and by the way they're
[1:24:40.160 --> 1:24:43.520]  announcing hollywood is officially collapsing this virus is a cover for
[1:24:43.520 --> 1:24:48.320]  the reset i mean look at that
[1:24:49.520 --> 1:24:52.320]  gutter worm

[1:25:06.240 --> 1:25:16.240]  you will die in fact i bet mr rapaport is dead within 12 months
[1:25:16.240 --> 1:25:19.760]  i just have a feeling i'm not gonna hurt him anybody else to hurt a hair on his
[1:25:19.760 --> 1:25:23.760]  head but that worm looks like the expiration date
[1:25:23.760 --> 1:25:28.080]  ran out on him a long time ago

[1:33:42.560 --> 1:33:45.920]  like new orleans using every excuse they can
[1:33:45.920 --> 1:33:49.920]  to crack down on law-abiding citizens and the essential right and critical
[1:33:49.920 --> 1:33:53.280]  infrastructure of protecting yourself you imagine
[1:33:53.280 --> 1:33:56.240]  letting the criminals out of jail all over the country in blue cities and blue

[1:34:50.720 --> 1:34:55.920]  and i was already aware of this comeback he took over a pharmaceutical company
[1:34:55.920 --> 1:35:01.600]  and increased on average the drugs 5 000
[1:35:02.960 --> 1:35:05.680]  and then he said he was doing that to help capitalize the company but it was
[1:35:05.680 --> 1:35:09.040]  really looting it and it met you later screwed the company over
[1:35:09.040 --> 1:35:12.960]  and hurt people that needed the drugs but it's okay because he's a liberal from
[1:35:12.960 --> 1:35:17.120]  harvard and he calls himself an activist investor
[1:35:17.120 --> 1:35:21.280]  yes like soros it's like calling hitler an activist

[1:36:30.400 --> 1:36:35.840]  when billionaire bill ackman went on television
[1:36:35.840 --> 1:36:39.120]  last week to tearfully warn that hell is coming
[1:36:39.120 --> 1:36:42.800]  and begged the white house to shut down the country for 30 days
[1:36:42.800 --> 1:36:46.000]  he was knee-deep in a bet against the markets

[1:38:48.800 --> 1:38:53.680]  link to the new york times story on the development
[1:38:54.080 --> 1:38:58.720]  it's just par for the course with these people
[1:38:58.720 --> 1:39:04.080]  the scum of the earth ladies and gentlemen now i've got a lot of other
[1:39:04.080 --> 1:39:07.280]  news here so much it makes my head spin and more is breaking as we speak at
[1:39:07.280 --> 1:39:09.040]  enforce.com some big stories are coming off the
[1:39:09.040 --> 1:39:11.600]  printer right now that i'll cover briefly when we come back and go to your
[1:39:11.600 --> 1:39:14.480]  calls but i just want to say something that's really
[1:39:14.480 --> 1:39:17.280]  important right now
[1:39:17.280 --> 1:39:23.120]  ladies and gentlemen we told you almost nine weeks ago this virus was
[1:39:23.120 --> 1:39:26.160]  man-made and that it was killing people and that we
[1:39:26.160 --> 1:39:30.480]  should be concerned about the crisis it was going to create when it got here
[1:39:30.480 --> 1:39:34.240]  because if it was anywhere as deadly as the chai comms were saying
[1:39:34.240 --> 1:39:37.680]  the left was going to seize on it exacerbate the crisis
[1:39:37.680 --> 1:39:41.680]  and try to overthrow trump by plunging the economy which they then
[1:39:41.680 --> 1:39:45.520]  did exactly as we said because these criminals if anything
[1:39:45.520 --> 1:39:50.080]  are 100 predictable they will create crises they will exacerbate crises
[1:39:50.080 --> 1:39:55.360]  they will let no crisis go to waste then we knew trump was being set up
[1:39:55.360 --> 1:39:59.040]  by trying to stop the stock market plunge we said ride the tiger
[1:39:59.040 --> 1:40:03.680]  go with some of it mitigate the problem the virus does kill some people
[1:40:03.680 --> 1:40:07.920]  but don't let them totally shut down the entire economy
[1:40:07.920 --> 1:40:15.600]  now all of that also unfolded and we laid it out
[1:40:15.600 --> 1:40:18.880]  we told you the storable food would sell out we told you that food would be the
[1:40:18.880 --> 1:40:21.840]  new toilet paper and something you actually need
[1:40:21.840 --> 1:40:25.360]  the supply chains are breaking down most places can't get food food prices are
[1:40:25.360 --> 1:40:27.840]  going up those we that ordered food wisely should
[1:40:27.840 --> 1:40:29.680]  be very happy you've gotten your food those that
[1:40:29.680 --> 1:40:33.040]  ordered a few weeks ago it'll be coming very soon we're right on target for
[1:40:33.040 --> 1:40:36.400]  the dates we told you but our major food supplier the only
[1:40:36.400 --> 1:40:40.000]  big one left that actually has high quality food had to suspend sales be
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:43.680]  able to catch up and get all your orders out they were able to secure a lot of
[1:40:43.680 --> 1:40:48.720]  food they now have and turn on two big factories
[1:40:48.720 --> 1:40:51.680]  that are essential services because a lot of other folks are just getting out of
[1:40:51.680 --> 1:40:54.960]  the business it's too volatile but it's their christian
[1:40:54.960 --> 1:40:58.240]  mission to do this it's what they believe in it's how 12 years ago they came

[1:48:44.320 --> 1:48:49.440]  i've i've met with some of these people and you know the power of the grass
[1:48:49.440 --> 1:48:52.960]  roots is what's so great that's why i don't like it
[1:48:52.960 --> 1:48:57.200]  when people say oh alex is funded by some government agency or some secret of
[1:48:57.200 --> 1:49:03.040]  group that's not cool because i'm organic
[1:49:03.040 --> 1:49:08.320]  i came from texas i did this with our audience of activists you did this
[1:49:08.320 --> 1:49:12.480]  we're real i mean where's the best rock and roll
[1:49:12.480 --> 1:49:18.080]  come from out of nowhere where's the best race car driver out of nowhere
[1:49:18.080 --> 1:49:22.800]  where's the best of anything come from it comes from the grass roots we're
[1:49:22.800 --> 1:49:26.880]  real and we've proven we're real and trump has
[1:49:26.880 --> 1:49:32.240]  proven he's real i mean david i doesn't trust anybody
[1:49:32.240 --> 1:49:35.360]  he knows boris johnson's for real and says boris johnson
[1:49:35.360 --> 1:49:38.720]  obviously means well because he knows people that know johnson he knows johnson
[1:49:38.720 --> 1:49:43.040]  johnson's for real people can pick that up too he's not perfect he's got problems
[1:49:43.040 --> 1:49:48.880]  so is trump i mean trumps real folks why do you think they're so damn scared but
[1:49:48.880 --> 1:49:53.200]  i'm gonna explain something a rattlesnake's real
[1:49:53.200 --> 1:49:57.040]  a black widow's real a rose is real
[1:49:57.040 --> 1:50:01.120]  a piece of gold's real a Beethoven symphony's real
[1:50:01.120 --> 1:50:04.320]  there's good and bad in the world but trumps his own man
[1:50:04.320 --> 1:50:09.440]  he really calls the shots you know how pissed the globalist are
[1:50:09.440 --> 1:50:13.360]  that there's a dude in there that isn't out to get america
[1:50:13.360 --> 1:50:19.280]  just like vladimir putin vladimir putin's a russian he likes russia he likes the
[1:50:19.280 --> 1:50:23.200]  orthodox church he doesn't like the globalist and the left
[1:50:23.200 --> 1:50:29.280]  that had their foot on russia's neck for its 85 years the very same globalist
[1:50:29.280 --> 1:50:32.240]  that's why they hate putin
[1:50:32.880 --> 1:50:35.680]  does he have to work with other corrupt elements just to keep those folks off
[1:50:35.680 --> 1:50:39.680]  his back absolutely is he in a swamp absolutely
[1:50:39.680 --> 1:50:44.000]  but when they say we are influenced by the russians the only truth is the same
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:47.120]  spirit of wanting to be free that god has given us
[1:50:47.120 --> 1:50:51.360]  that the russians now have is the same spirit we have
[1:50:51.360 --> 1:50:55.200]  and we are going to defeat the spirit of evil with our spirit
[1:50:55.200 --> 1:51:00.480]  of overcoming because the wicked flee when none pursue
[1:51:00.480 --> 1:51:04.480]  but the righteous are bold as a lion
[1:51:04.480 --> 1:51:10.720]  and it's time for this crap to stop
[1:51:10.880 --> 1:51:17.520]  hollywood hates you the left hates you the globalist want to dominate you
[1:51:17.520 --> 1:51:20.720]  they are psychotics
[1:51:22.240 --> 1:51:25.120]  and so people come to me and i only talk with this people that understand
[1:51:25.120 --> 1:51:28.960]  philosophy and this is the winning philosophy it's a spirit they hate it
[1:51:28.960 --> 1:51:34.560]  overcomer and they go what's it like to be persecuted
[1:51:34.560 --> 1:51:37.760]  oh you're attacked so much oh we feel so sorry for you and i tell friends and
[1:51:37.760 --> 1:51:43.360]  family i say not get off i am blessed all i want the listeners to keep us in
[1:51:43.360 --> 1:51:46.160]  the fight that you are the people that have
[1:51:46.160 --> 1:51:49.280]  commissioned me in this fight like you commissioned an artist into a
[1:51:49.280 --> 1:51:52.000]  painting you commissioned a soldier to be an officer
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:55.520]  you have commissioned me with your support and your prayers
[1:51:55.520 --> 1:51:59.840]  and i feel like i let you down sometimes
[1:51:59.840 --> 1:52:02.800]  when you call in and tell me how great i am because i'm just like you i want
[1:52:02.800 --> 1:52:04.800]  freedom i want justice i believe in you
[1:52:04.800 --> 1:52:07.600]  you're just as smart and just as strong as i am in many ways
[1:52:07.600 --> 1:52:10.880]  and you're stronger in other ways and i'm stronger other ways that's how god
[1:52:10.880 --> 1:52:15.840]  works but my spirit is real my will for
[1:52:15.840 --> 1:52:18.640]  justice and my heartache for the innocent being
[1:52:18.640 --> 1:52:22.240]  dumbed down and killed and abused and and my heartache over the
[1:52:22.240 --> 1:52:26.800]  absolute evil unfolding on this planet is a hundred percent real and my
[1:52:26.800 --> 1:52:29.040]  desire to be with god is a hundred percent real
[1:52:29.040 --> 1:52:32.400]  and my desire to defeat the globalist with god's help
[1:52:32.400 --> 1:52:36.960]  is totally real and that's why it's happening
[1:52:36.960 --> 1:52:40.080]  and that's why they fear it
[1:52:40.800 --> 1:52:44.960]  look to what we've done together this is the model of success
[1:52:44.960 --> 1:52:48.800]  this is what they fear independence strength
[1:52:48.800 --> 1:52:54.480]  justice truth steadfastness being honorable
[1:52:54.480 --> 1:52:57.520]  and that's why they constantly want to say i'm a liar
[1:52:57.520 --> 1:53:00.800]  and i'm a fake and i'm an actor and i'm dishonest
[1:53:00.800 --> 1:53:05.120]  because they are and they don't have the real
[1:53:05.120 --> 1:53:09.200]  spark of the universe that you have that i have
[1:53:09.200 --> 1:53:12.400]  and so they seek to extinguish it i said i can tell this news i'll get to it
[1:53:12.400 --> 1:53:14.720]  after i take calls there's so much breaking
[1:53:14.720 --> 1:53:17.920]  let's go ahead because i'm not going to babble all day i i just want to speak
[1:53:17.920 --> 1:53:22.800]  to that you're not intimidated you were asleep
[1:53:22.800 --> 1:53:27.760]  and it's not work to fight evil the more you do it the stronger you get and the
[1:53:27.760 --> 1:53:32.320]  more high on the fight you get in a good way of love
[1:53:32.320 --> 1:53:36.320]  and of justice but it's not a it's not a feeling of power that we're overpowering
[1:53:36.320 --> 1:53:40.640]  the globalist but it is power trillions of times
[1:53:40.640 --> 1:53:45.280]  the power they could ever imagine but was restrained
[1:53:45.280 --> 1:53:48.640]  and then you realize it's nothing but a micron reflection of the creator
[1:53:48.640 --> 1:53:52.240]  and then you feel the awesome presence of god and then the power doesn't matter
[1:53:52.240 --> 1:53:58.080]  anymore because you're on your knees and to be on your knees before the creator
[1:53:58.080 --> 1:54:01.600]  in all is to be ready to fight the devil
[1:54:01.600 --> 1:54:06.000]  because the devil's a joke that'll be brushed aside
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:10.720]  but the devil will be brushed aside by those of us
[1:54:10.720 --> 1:54:15.520]  who will be thrown against satan and broken and it is a real blessing to
[1:54:15.520 --> 1:54:19.200]  have god pick you up and just throw you head
[1:54:19.200 --> 1:54:23.520]  long into satan's armies there's not a better feeling
[1:54:23.520 --> 1:54:27.520]  i'm not a masochist i don't like pain but that's the type of pain i'll take
[1:54:27.520 --> 1:54:32.160]  if god helps me politically take out a million or two million of the globalist
[1:54:32.160 --> 1:54:36.880]  then i don't mind being torn inside out and my eyeballs gouged out of my
[1:54:36.880 --> 1:54:40.880]  teeth ripped out and my blood sucked out by a
[1:54:40.880 --> 1:54:44.960]  giant black spire i've seen the evil i've faced it
[1:54:44.960 --> 1:54:54.560]  i've gone through it and all i found was victory on the other side
[1:54:54.560 --> 1:54:59.440]  the enemy for all the temporal attacks has sent spiritual attacks against me
[1:54:59.440 --> 1:55:03.520]  and in the name of jesus it all instantly departs
[1:55:03.520 --> 1:55:08.320]  and is vanquished and is weak but i've been shown the depths of satan
[1:55:08.320 --> 1:55:12.080]  by the creator i have been dropped like a bath
[1:55:12.080 --> 1:55:17.680]  escape into a sea of pure satanism to actually be able to know the enemy's
[1:55:17.680 --> 1:55:22.480]  mind and to be able to fight the enemy and only now am i beginning to have the
[1:55:22.480 --> 1:55:28.080]  strength to even step up into the armor of truth and justice
[1:55:28.080 --> 1:55:38.320]  with the sword of god to bring down the enemy
[1:55:38.320 --> 1:55:42.800]  so you look at the hunchback devils that serve satan and how their eyes are dim
[1:55:42.800 --> 1:55:46.080]  and how they have no humanity in them and realize we shouldn't hate them
[1:55:46.080 --> 1:55:51.360]  those are like little bugs in a spider's web that are just husk
[1:55:51.360 --> 1:55:54.880]  they're dead they were already sucked out they're already gone
[1:55:54.880 --> 1:55:58.400]  they live in the spider's belly now forever
[1:55:58.400 --> 1:56:01.920]  they believe the spider was their mother and was there to give them milk
[1:56:01.920 --> 1:56:04.880]  they believe the spider was going to give them power they believe they were
[1:56:04.880 --> 1:56:09.680]  going to be a spider but all they ever were was
[1:56:09.680 --> 1:56:16.160]  another slave taken away from god's light who by free will like a child
[1:56:16.160 --> 1:56:19.840]  tricked out of their backyard to get in that white ice cream truck
[1:56:19.840 --> 1:56:23.520]  to be taken away forever
[1:56:23.520 --> 1:56:30.080]  to have their souls stolen forever and to meet oblivion
[1:56:30.080 --> 1:56:33.280]  it's a sad thing indeed all right we're gonna go to break i'm gonna stop

[2:00:09.680 --> 2:00:12.880]  thanks for calling i really appreciate you go ahead
[2:00:12.880 --> 2:00:16.720]  thank you alex congratulations on a terrific
[2:00:16.720 --> 2:00:22.240]  challenge to the globalists the virus coronavirus has shown that globalism
[2:00:22.240 --> 2:00:25.680]  doesn't work essentially the best alternative for
[2:00:25.680 --> 2:00:30.160]  mankind is to have local governments where they take care of each
[2:00:30.160 --> 2:00:33.920]  an area completely leaving defense to the federal
[2:00:33.920 --> 2:00:36.720]  leaving health care even at the federal level
[2:00:36.720 --> 2:00:40.240]  but at the level of providing for the individual person
[2:00:40.240 --> 2:00:43.920]  as soon as there's a detection of a virus you deal with it locally
[2:00:43.920 --> 2:00:47.200]  instead of having the whole world to put to uh to
[2:00:47.200 --> 2:00:50.960]  on halt and and all of the other incipient military
[2:00:50.960 --> 2:00:55.440]  um orders that follow so and violation of rights so that's my first comment to
[2:00:55.440 --> 2:00:58.720]  you it doesn't work i'd like to hear what you think of it and the second
[2:00:58.720 --> 2:01:02.480]  comment i'd like to make is that what was done in 2008
[2:01:02.480 --> 2:01:06.320]  precipitating a federal government bailout basically
[2:01:06.320 --> 2:01:09.840]  burdening the taxpayers with 700 billion dollars
[2:01:09.840 --> 2:01:14.720]  to provide what the money didn't disappear when this stock market crashed
[2:01:14.720 --> 2:01:18.400]  the sellers got their money on their way up they still have it look at these
[2:01:18.400 --> 2:01:21.920]  are boasting this these people are going on and i agree that it's all a
[2:01:21.920 --> 2:01:24.240]  giant scam the globalists are holding economy hostage of
[2:01:24.240 --> 2:01:26.880]  trump isn't giving the money at least most of money is being directed at the
[2:01:26.880 --> 2:01:29.120]  public but let's go back i want to be
[2:01:29.120 --> 2:01:33.040]  clear i wasn't boasting or anything earlier that was not a challenge to the
[2:01:33.040 --> 2:01:38.400]  globalist that was a commitment to in front of god
[2:01:38.400 --> 2:01:41.840]  and everybody else to absolutely stay the course
[2:01:41.840 --> 2:01:45.840]  and it and let the globalists know that i know what the potential ends are
[2:01:45.840 --> 2:01:48.880]  because i don't want them to ever get me torture me kill me whatever and then
[2:01:48.880 --> 2:01:51.520]  think they won i want to know that i willingly did this
[2:01:51.520 --> 2:01:55.280]  that takes the victory away from them so that wasn't a boast or a challenge
[2:01:55.280 --> 2:01:59.840]  that was more a signing the john hand cock on the dotted line does that make sense
[2:01:59.840 --> 2:02:03.120]  it makes a lot of sense but alex listen who elected
[2:02:03.120 --> 2:02:07.360]  international financiers to run the world no no no doubt the globalist banks
[2:02:07.360 --> 2:02:10.240]  are taking my cat has made that point yesterday when he was hosting or was it
[2:02:10.240 --> 2:02:13.920]  Wednesday the globalist banks are nationalizing everything they're
[2:02:13.920 --> 2:02:17.680]  taking over the planet right now using these crises i totally agree with you
[2:02:17.680 --> 2:02:21.120]  i'm just i care more about political power over the government and i know
[2:02:21.120 --> 2:02:24.080]  they're holding things hostage so a trillion wasn't enough than two trillion
[2:02:24.080 --> 2:02:27.360]  was enough so trump said four trillion at least a lot of the money
[2:02:27.360 --> 2:02:31.120]  is going to be forgiven and given to the public
[2:02:31.120 --> 2:02:35.120]  we're already hyper inflating into the future uh and so
[2:02:35.120 --> 2:02:38.240]  i understand this the scenario i mean do you think trump sold us out with us
[2:02:38.240 --> 2:02:42.000]  what do you think go ahead let him have it i i would like to tell you
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:45.200]  that president trump just missed a fantastic opportunity
[2:02:45.200 --> 2:02:48.640]  to simply say thank you very much i know that trillions are needed
[2:02:48.640 --> 2:02:52.400]  but we're going to borrow them from the treasury of united states as specified
[2:02:52.400 --> 2:02:55.440]  in our constitution and simply say we're going to save
[2:02:55.440 --> 2:02:59.520]  five hundred billion dollars a year on interest that we pay no no i agree he
[2:02:59.520 --> 2:03:01.840]  should get us out of the private federal reserve system
[2:03:01.840 --> 2:03:04.960]  but what it's now a hundred and seven years old
[2:03:04.960 --> 2:03:08.960]  seems just like yesterday we had the hundredth anniversary 1913 uh yeah no
[2:03:08.960 --> 2:03:12.480]  you're absolutely right he five g's bad he has the vaccines like he said he
[2:03:12.480 --> 2:03:15.280]  do uh and and and he's he put a new bunch of
[2:03:15.280 --> 2:03:19.360]  new federal reserve people in to do what he wants but still the shareholders
[2:03:19.360 --> 2:03:22.320]  are the ones making the money and it is private so you're absolutely right
[2:03:22.320 --> 2:03:25.360]  and and you're right why don't we why don't we just have the treasury create
[2:03:25.360 --> 2:03:28.640]  the credit why do we have a private bank doing
[2:03:28.640 --> 2:03:35.200]  it's specified in the constitution in in 1913 at the christmas break just before
[2:03:35.200 --> 2:03:40.240]  they passed it by a hair it had no mandate to do so
[2:03:40.240 --> 2:03:44.080]  and it wasn't even a proper quorum of the senators brother i know you're you're
[2:03:44.080 --> 2:03:47.040]  dead on we should get g ever griffin back on it no he was doing interviews
[2:03:47.040 --> 2:03:50.560]  anymore but i saw him on with uh allen keys i think it was we should get him
[2:03:50.560 --> 2:03:54.000]  back on the show we should get allen keys back on uh as well
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:58.320]  anything else carlos yeah the only thing is this that if president
[2:03:58.320 --> 2:04:04.080]  trump was able to do that and and save 500 billion dollars a year in interest
[2:04:04.080 --> 2:04:07.840]  on loans that they should be paid back to the treasury by the eval of the
[2:04:07.840 --> 2:04:11.840]  american people it's in the constitution now you said the smartest thing i've
[2:04:11.840 --> 2:04:15.200]  heard this week even if we're focused on him for
[2:04:15.200 --> 2:04:19.040]  giving the loans they get businesses and and the checks they send people
[2:04:19.040 --> 2:04:22.160]  after ordering him to stay at home which is again this whole
[2:04:22.160 --> 2:04:25.600]  guaranteed universal income it's a bad robert going down
[2:04:25.600 --> 2:04:29.200]  but the central banks will still get the interest on that including the chai
[2:04:29.200 --> 2:04:32.240]  comms so you're absolutely right it should be done by the treasury
[2:04:32.240 --> 2:04:35.040]  and not by the fellow reserve right now it's two trillion from the treasury
[2:04:35.040 --> 2:04:38.000]  two trillion from the fellow reserve and it just shows the robert going down
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:42.160]  thank you carlos that's a smart caller smarter than me i didn't think of that
[2:04:42.160 --> 2:04:46.480]  all right we're going to come back with jamal in the land down under

[2:06:46.880 --> 2:06:49.920]  here's what he said on the steps of the capital
[2:06:49.920 --> 2:06:54.560]  see let you do this record well they didn't even give me a minute to speak
[2:06:54.560 --> 2:06:58.000]  in a four-hour debate that's there's a big cover-up in there
[2:06:58.000 --> 2:07:01.440]  we have a cover-up sir well they're trying to cover up their votes
[2:07:01.440 --> 2:07:04.960]  they had enough people there to pass the bill but they still refuse to have a
[2:07:04.960 --> 2:07:08.800]  recorded vote and they told me they were trying to protect members
[2:07:08.800 --> 2:07:11.600]  don't you believe that that's the case there's 435 members in a room that can't
[2:07:11.600 --> 2:07:15.760]  hold that many no no they're trying to protect the members who are there
[2:07:15.760 --> 2:07:20.000]  from political ramifications there are both sides of the chamber your side as
[2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:22.240]  well as the democrats as well as the white house it's something they didn't
[2:07:22.240 --> 2:07:24.880]  want you to do this why press forward end of the bill that
[2:07:24.880 --> 2:07:28.640]  everybody agrees should be passed like i said in there i came here this week to
[2:07:28.640 --> 2:07:32.000]  make sure our republic doesn't die in an empty chamber by
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:35.200]  unanimous consent these people need to do their jobs
[2:07:35.200 --> 2:07:38.480]  if they're telling people to drive a truck if they're telling people to bag
[2:07:38.480 --> 2:07:43.440]  groceries and grow their food then by by golly they can be in there and they
[2:07:43.440 --> 2:07:46.000]  can vote and that's what and that's what we did this
[2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:49.040]  week they came and you can see it didn't delay the vote any
[2:07:49.040 --> 2:07:52.480]  they sat on their cans yesterday here they didn't do a thing
[2:07:52.480 --> 2:07:56.240]  yesterday they were trying to say this would delay it to have a recorded vote
[2:07:56.240 --> 2:08:00.160]  the truth if you're willing to report it is they don't want a recorded vote they
[2:08:00.160 --> 2:08:04.800]  don't want to be on record of making the biggest mistake in history
[2:08:04.800 --> 2:08:10.880]  i'm calling you a third-rate grandstander i'm at least second grade
[2:08:10.880 --> 2:08:14.320]  congressman nicely done yeah i've forgotten about
[2:08:14.320 --> 2:08:18.400]  thomas matz he's like a libertarian republican from kentucky a good guy
[2:08:18.400 --> 2:08:21.760]  and that's absolutely true i mean they really should
[2:08:21.760 --> 2:08:25.920]  have a record of the votes and so i think trump kind of went off half-cocked
[2:08:25.920 --> 2:08:28.240]  on him but trump really does not want the economy to
[2:08:28.240 --> 2:08:32.400]  implode and gets a little uh crocodile-y when it comes down to the last
[2:08:32.400 --> 2:08:37.280]  minute but uh the stock market is down 65
[2:08:37.280 --> 2:08:41.520]  points down jones it was up i guess until
[2:08:41.520 --> 2:08:45.920]  the news that the package hasn't passed yet talk about the independent folks and
[2:08:45.920 --> 2:08:50.080]  all this is going to do is he value the dollar further i know why trump did it
[2:08:50.080 --> 2:08:55.040]  i know the globalists have launched this i know we're in a war i'm just saying
[2:08:55.040 --> 2:08:58.240]  thank god trump's trying to put the brakes on the shutdown the shutdown's the
[2:08:58.240 --> 2:09:02.160]  big threat but this kicks the can down the road
[2:09:02.160 --> 2:09:05.120]  do we want trump to lose we want democrats getting in they're gonna go for
[2:09:05.120 --> 2:09:09.440]  broke they get in we got 220 days left here and now the
[2:09:09.440 --> 2:09:15.520]  democrats states begin prep for mail-in voting for presidential election
[2:09:16.240 --> 2:09:19.280]  that's all over the news us a day you name it so they're they're gonna go with
[2:09:19.280 --> 2:09:21.600]  this if trump lets that happen he's crazy
[2:09:21.600 --> 2:09:26.800]  all right jamal in australia what is your view on all this thank you for

[2:11:04.080 --> 2:11:08.080]  my sources uh and i've got friends x military and x
[2:11:08.080 --> 2:11:12.960]  right squad they're getting calls up now um
[2:11:12.960 --> 2:11:18.160]  sunday's the lockdown for sydney i've been told but i'd like to be wrong um
[2:11:18.160 --> 2:11:22.000]  and i'd love to give a shout out to my friend mick raven from conspiracy
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:24.880]  odds he's been doing a podcast for 10 plus years
[2:11:24.880 --> 2:11:28.400]  i was a guest on on his um podcast last week
[2:11:28.400 --> 2:11:35.280]  and uh and i'd say end game is your fine bottle of wine my friend that that
[2:11:35.280 --> 2:11:41.920]  movie has changed more minds that were um set in the left right paradigm
[2:11:41.920 --> 2:11:47.760]  um once they see that film not the not the marvel comics one but your one
[2:11:47.760 --> 2:11:51.440]  um it changes people's perspective because it
[2:11:51.440 --> 2:11:55.920]  presents it with facts and and and that's what people need
[2:11:55.920 --> 2:12:00.560]  amazon three months ago bandit saying it was nazi
[2:12:00.560 --> 2:12:04.560]  that it was hate speech even though the film exposes eugenics and the nazis
[2:12:04.560 --> 2:12:08.880]  from the start and and and so don't you love it how they operate
[2:12:08.880 --> 2:12:12.880]  um but the film had 54 million views on google video
[2:12:12.880 --> 2:12:15.760]  and they finally got rid of google video that was 13 14 years ago
[2:12:15.760 --> 2:12:19.200]  then it had about 15 million views on one channel they they deleted that
[2:12:19.200 --> 2:12:23.840]  channel it still has about four or five million views on one channel on youtube
[2:12:23.840 --> 2:12:26.640]  you can type an in-game blueprint for global enslavement into youtube guys do
[2:12:26.640 --> 2:12:30.080]  that for me and you can still find it on change the channel is the name of the
[2:12:30.080 --> 2:12:32.960]  guy uh but uh you know judge for yourself know
[2:12:32.960 --> 2:12:36.000]  it's a powerful film we have a limited amount of the dbd's
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:39.520]  still here at info wars i'm signing the last ones uh but it really does lay off
[2:12:39.520 --> 2:12:43.040]  their plan from their own words yeah i'm getting banned
[2:12:43.040 --> 2:12:48.160]  dot video out to my friends and uh all my um contacts because that is something
[2:12:48.160 --> 2:12:52.000]  you can shoot through a video too and they can um just click the link on that
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:55.840]  obviously we know youtube doesn't work um google broken
[2:12:55.840 --> 2:13:00.160]  uh you know you search for some some information you're not going to find it
[2:13:00.160 --> 2:13:04.320]  i think we're all in the same boat here alec i'm in australia you're in texas
[2:13:04.320 --> 2:13:08.720]  we're getting all the same thing uh and i love brainstorming too
[2:13:08.720 --> 2:13:14.320]  because the corona virus uh yeah it's you know it's going to be used for it
[2:13:14.320 --> 2:13:18.400]  to chip every individual on the planet that's what we're looking at the new
[2:13:18.400 --> 2:13:23.360]  world order and uh you know fear once you get past that fear
[2:13:23.360 --> 2:13:27.280]  guys and if you're a new listener uh if you've got enough knowledge and you
[2:13:27.280 --> 2:13:31.440]  believe in what you do the fear goes away
[2:13:31.440 --> 2:13:35.200]  what would you say to that alec i totally agree with your brother god bless
[2:13:35.200 --> 2:13:38.720]  you and i appreciate your call and i guess it's kind of like six million views
[2:13:38.720 --> 2:13:41.600]  or whatever on youtube but they'll probably delete that too because
[2:13:41.600 --> 2:13:44.960]  it's nazi ladies and gentlemen to be against the nazis uh let's go to
[2:13:44.960 --> 2:13:48.880]  david in montana thank you david welcome

[2:17:59.280 --> 2:18:03.120]  storeable food orders because the company that supplies us was backed up and was
[2:18:03.120 --> 2:18:06.640]  busy getting out the orders they had now they've opened up two more factories
[2:18:06.640 --> 2:18:09.600]  they've bought a whole bunch more high quality food they're packaging it right
[2:18:09.600 --> 2:18:11.760]  now and they're going to be able to ship it out to you very soon
[2:18:11.760 --> 2:18:15.920]  so get your orders in now every other major food
[2:18:15.920 --> 2:18:19.520]  manufacturer in the storeable food area has been sold out for a long time

[2:18:22.720 --> 2:18:26.720]  we do but it takes time to package it and get it out to you the bad news is
[2:18:26.720 --> 2:18:31.360]  hey i hope the virus blows over but the globalist trying to cancel the election
[2:18:31.360 --> 2:18:35.360]  and the economy may go south now more than ever is the time to have high
[2:18:35.360 --> 2:18:37.200]  quality storeable food and the place to get it

[2:20:59.440 --> 2:21:01.600]  active and we're battling it all in the appeals
[2:21:01.600 --> 2:21:06.240]  court before it ever even gets in front of their kangaroo courts or juries
[2:21:06.240 --> 2:21:10.160]  and they're pissed about that and so it's always jones losing jones losing and
[2:21:10.160 --> 2:21:13.120]  most of the time i've been lost to lawsuits there's not even a lawsuit

[2:21:27.520 --> 2:21:30.000]  and remember there's no world government they're just announcing it now
[2:21:30.000 --> 2:21:32.240]  former british prime minister says we need world government to counter the
[2:21:32.240 --> 2:21:36.640]  coronavirus london guardian headline that can we put that up guys just
[2:21:36.640 --> 2:21:40.960]  gordon brown calls world government there it is london guardian
[2:21:40.960 --> 2:21:44.320]  when i read this new article that i'll cover after i take calls
[2:21:44.320 --> 2:21:47.680]  google bans m4's android app they already banned the
[2:21:47.680 --> 2:21:51.920]  apple and it was number one in news google bans m4's android app over
[2:21:51.920 --> 2:21:55.280]  coronavirus claim
[2:21:57.040 --> 2:22:01.680]  and then it quotes the video i got banned for
[2:22:03.040 --> 2:22:09.520]  with david ike yesterday where i said this is an anti-human system and under
[2:22:09.520 --> 2:22:12.320]  the georgia guide stones under world government they want to reduce world
[2:22:12.320 --> 2:22:16.160]  population to zero and all of you that serve this are being deceived
[2:22:16.160 --> 2:22:19.520]  when you think you're going to be the few humans left whatever this
[2:22:19.520 --> 2:22:22.640]  anti-human not human forces that the bible talks about
[2:22:22.640 --> 2:22:26.480]  wants to kill still destroy they quote that and say
[2:22:26.480 --> 2:22:32.880]  that is coronavirus disinformation so my religious belief that the devil's real
[2:22:32.880 --> 2:22:36.800]  they actually say isn't allowed you got to read this man
[2:22:36.800 --> 2:22:42.400]  front page of wired magazine and it'll be everywhere now this just broke
[2:22:42.400 --> 2:22:46.560]  along with the latest bs about sandy hook
[2:22:50.560 --> 2:22:55.200]  we didn't even appeal some sanctions the democrat judge did
[2:22:55.200 --> 2:22:58.960]  his best friends with the lady on the appeals court at the local appeals
[2:22:58.960 --> 2:23:02.240]  court not the supreme court where it's going in texas
[2:23:02.240 --> 2:23:07.920]  and we didn't even appeal sanctions that if we lose the case down the road we
[2:23:07.920 --> 2:23:11.280]  would have to you know pay for some legal fees or something
[2:23:11.280 --> 2:23:14.320]  they just recycle that story again and go jones
[2:23:14.320 --> 2:23:17.680]  has to pay more legal fees they report on the same legal fees
[2:23:17.680 --> 2:23:20.480]  every couple weeks like you just think it's just the same story
[2:23:20.480 --> 2:23:24.240]  but they recycle it trump says all mexicans are criminals
[2:23:24.240 --> 2:23:26.720]  not true
[2:23:27.920 --> 2:23:31.440]  but that but i was checking that latest thing is the press is calling me during
[2:23:31.440 --> 2:23:35.600]  the break let me type my name into google oh
[2:23:35.600 --> 2:23:44.960]  the popular five star rated info wars app is banned
[2:23:46.240 --> 2:23:51.040]  and then you read the offending material
[2:23:55.040 --> 2:23:57.840]  and it says
[2:23:57.840 --> 2:24:01.280]  because jones
[2:24:01.840 --> 2:24:06.080]  said that there are humans on the planet that have made a deal with extraterrestrials
[2:24:06.080 --> 2:24:11.200]  to set up a kill grid and take out humanity and i'm banned for that
[2:24:11.200 --> 2:24:14.640]  why would you ban somebody for that that's like what a crazy guy on the
[2:24:14.640 --> 2:24:20.480]  side of the street says right no no that's what they're into
[2:24:20.480 --> 2:24:24.080]  you can't make a deal with these aliens okay
[2:24:24.080 --> 2:24:29.680]  that the bible tells you about and ever get off the planet
[2:24:30.240 --> 2:24:33.680]  elsewhere in the video jones claims that the
[2:24:33.680 --> 2:24:38.960]  natural antivirals exist to treat the novel coronavirus
[2:24:41.520 --> 2:24:48.160]  i'm not selling vitamin c i mean i got products it's in
[2:24:48.160 --> 2:24:51.120]  it's on the news the doctors are saying it's promising
[2:24:51.120 --> 2:24:53.680]  or zinc
[2:24:54.800 --> 2:25:03.440]  or what's in tonic quinine that that's what that's what's called a tonic
[2:25:03.440 --> 2:25:06.640]  it's just grandfathered over they didn't grandfathered coca-cola to let
[2:25:06.640 --> 2:25:10.800]  cocaine in it but they grandfathered tonic that goes with chin
[2:25:10.800 --> 2:25:14.320]  to have the quinine that's antiviral that's that's what doctors are saying
[2:25:14.320 --> 2:25:19.040]  that's in the news but see that's how the censorship works folks
[2:25:19.040 --> 2:25:24.320]  now you can't even say
[2:25:24.960 --> 2:25:28.640]  that hey there's hope and you have all these governors saying
[2:25:28.640 --> 2:25:34.720]  doctors can't prescribe the hydroxy chloroquine because they
[2:25:34.720 --> 2:25:38.640]  don't want you to have hope the democrats look at this
[2:25:38.640 --> 2:25:42.320]  mylon producing potential COVID-19 treatment
[2:25:42.320 --> 2:25:47.680]  in west virginia that's wd tv they've ordered emergency production
[2:25:47.680 --> 2:25:54.640]  of the prescription version of quinine
[2:25:54.640 --> 2:25:58.400]  i'm just reading what's in the news
[2:25:59.760 --> 2:26:05.360]  here's another one norvartis and others that supply tens of millions of
[2:26:05.360 --> 2:26:10.240]  chloroquine tablets to fight COVID-19 i mean that's what i was reading
[2:26:10.240 --> 2:26:15.280]  days ago they got his band i got to sue them over this i mean this is just
[2:26:15.280 --> 2:26:21.120]  because it's it's like they ban you for reading out of the newspaper
[2:26:21.120 --> 2:26:26.960]  and i'm not selling that drug i don't sell drugs
[2:26:26.960 --> 2:26:31.840]  but again that's the idea that's the perception that's what they say
[2:26:31.840 --> 2:26:35.120]  so we don't have any hope i've got two minutes to break going back to dave

[2:31:35.840 --> 2:31:39.120]  the future with elections may be canceled with the globalist trying to
[2:31:39.120 --> 2:31:43.680]  implode the economy this is just the beginning of the crisis

[2:32:05.200 --> 2:32:10.560]  and will exist but when trump says the cure is worse than disease
[2:32:10.560 --> 2:32:16.000]  he's talking about the media hype creating hysteria and trying to create
[2:32:16.000 --> 2:32:20.480]  uncertainty and it is that that i oppose
[2:32:20.480 --> 2:32:23.680]  it is not the american way to cower and live
[2:32:23.680 --> 2:32:27.840]  in fear and to follow the edicts and precedents
[2:32:27.840 --> 2:32:31.760]  set by communist china and hyper authoritarian
[2:32:31.760 --> 2:32:35.600]  singapore where you're now being given six months in jail
[2:32:35.600 --> 2:32:41.280]  if you don't stand at least six feet away from someone this is being used by
[2:32:41.280 --> 2:32:45.440]  social engineers and they admit that they are trying to transform our
[2:32:45.440 --> 2:32:49.120]  world forever into something unrecognizable

[2:33:56.320 --> 2:34:00.880]  that and looking at the federal law that wasn't there
[2:34:00.880 --> 2:34:04.960]  so he said no everybody else basically submitted
[2:34:04.960 --> 2:34:08.720]  and now he's got a letter in a moment i can show people
[2:34:08.720 --> 2:34:12.400]  on television after you read it the letter from the texas attorney general
[2:34:12.400 --> 2:34:15.200]  but you've seen the virginia governor say they're going to restrict guns you
[2:34:15.200 --> 2:34:17.920]  can't sell them you've seen places like norland say you can't
[2:34:17.920 --> 2:34:21.600]  carry your legal gun even in your car to protect yourself or you and you can't
[2:34:21.600 --> 2:34:25.120]  buy them and we've seen it all over the country california you name it a real
[2:34:25.120 --> 2:34:28.480]  crackdown so some breakdown what's gone
[2:34:28.480 --> 2:34:32.720]  on here play-by-play you and others saying no lawsuits have been filed
[2:34:32.720 --> 2:34:36.640]  in multiple states uh challenging uh this attorney
[2:34:36.640 --> 2:34:40.160]  general reminds them about a governor that you can't shut down gun shows you've
[2:34:40.160 --> 2:34:44.480]  had some good things there california uh the city attorney said they couldn't
[2:34:44.480 --> 2:34:48.480]  shut down gun shows but the sheriff still fought that uh coronavirus
[2:34:48.480 --> 2:34:51.920]  barrier city cracks down on gun stores shuts them down
[2:34:51.920 --> 2:34:56.400]  again lawsuits have been filed around the country uh over that as well trying to
[2:34:56.400 --> 2:34:59.920]  block it but this is just another power grab during an emergency
[2:34:59.920 --> 2:35:02.720]  mr cargill i mean isn't an essential right to defend yourself
[2:35:02.720 --> 2:35:06.880]  absolutely what you have is you have your different state local
[2:35:06.880 --> 2:35:10.320]  governments are saying that hey they're going to do what they always wanted to
[2:35:10.320 --> 2:35:12.960]  do and that's actually come after your second amendment rights
[2:35:12.960 --> 2:35:16.480]  and so what we're saying here in texas in texas you cannot do that we have a
[2:35:16.480 --> 2:35:19.840]  preemptive law that's actually been in place for quite a while
[2:35:19.840 --> 2:35:24.160]  we also have the hurricane katrina bill that's also been in effect
[2:35:24.160 --> 2:35:28.960]  so you cannot you know restrict firearms at least a city county or
[2:35:28.960 --> 2:35:32.240]  uh elected official cannot and that's what's good that came out of katrina all
[2:35:32.240 --> 2:35:35.440]  the guns will be taken no one allowed to be armed them grabbing the guns that
[2:35:35.440 --> 2:35:39.040]  that trigger people pass that law people set back then all texas doesn't need
[2:35:39.040 --> 2:35:42.800]  that your paranoid that's right and so we have these laws in place in texas
[2:35:42.800 --> 2:35:45.040]  and and basically what they try to do here in
[2:35:45.040 --> 2:35:48.080]  austin was they tried to well in texas that is
[2:35:48.080 --> 2:35:51.920]  because you have a you have an elected official in north texas that try to do
[2:35:51.920 --> 2:35:54.240]  this so one try to do it in west texas as well
[2:35:54.240 --> 2:35:57.840]  that gun stores would not an essential business and gun stores had to close
[2:35:57.840 --> 2:36:01.680]  down and so i refuse to close down because i said hey
[2:36:01.680 --> 2:36:03.920]  first of all people are going to need food they're going to need water they
[2:36:03.920 --> 2:36:07.360]  need medical care uh whatever they believe in they'll need that and they're
[2:36:07.360 --> 2:36:10.320]  also going to need a firearm to protect themselves because first responders
[2:36:10.320 --> 2:36:13.760]  are not going to respond they're going to have to be their own first responder
[2:36:13.760 --> 2:36:17.040]  and so we say that we're going to stay open because people need to be able to
[2:36:17.040 --> 2:36:19.440]  protect themselves and keep their families safe by the way the supreme
[2:36:19.440 --> 2:36:22.480]  court as you know has ruled five six times we know of
[2:36:22.480 --> 2:36:25.440]  that it's not the police job to protect you it's when a crime is committed it's
[2:36:25.440 --> 2:36:28.880]  their job to come they try to help you but they're not there like a genie that
[2:36:28.880 --> 2:36:32.160]  comes out of bottle protection that's right the supreme court ruled that law
[2:36:32.160 --> 2:36:35.840]  enforcement have no duty to enforce to protect you only general
[2:36:35.840 --> 2:36:39.200]  duty to enforce the law you're absolutely correct absolutely correct
[2:36:39.200 --> 2:36:42.320]  please continue can i see that letter to show tv viewers thank you this is a
[2:36:42.320 --> 2:36:46.080]  ruling from ken paxton he's the attorney general for the state of texas
[2:36:46.080 --> 2:36:50.160]  and ken paxton released a release a ruling today
[2:36:50.160 --> 2:36:53.680]  within the last 45 minutes to an hour so this is breaking
[2:36:53.680 --> 2:36:57.520]  this is breaking news that gun stores and gun manufacturers
[2:36:57.520 --> 2:37:01.760]  can stay open that your county your city municipalities your state your
[2:37:01.760 --> 2:37:07.040]  your county judges cannot shut down the gun store or gun manufacturers
[2:37:07.040 --> 2:37:11.600]  amazing please continue and so and basically what they did was they
[2:37:11.600 --> 2:37:15.520]  actually someone filed a complaint against us and
[2:37:15.520 --> 2:37:19.360]  the local police department as well as the code enforcement as well as the
[2:37:19.360 --> 2:37:22.720]  fire marshal came to my business yesterday to try to
[2:37:22.720 --> 2:37:26.720]  you know shut us down and so we stood firm and said hey you know we have a
[2:37:26.720 --> 2:37:30.320]  right to be here we have a right to open and do true color of law intimidation
[2:37:30.320 --> 2:37:33.920]  absolutely and i've refused to shut down you know and
[2:37:33.920 --> 2:37:37.600]  and so we we stood firm you know i had my attorney that's why i admire you is
[2:37:37.600 --> 2:37:40.080]  that you don't play you're always fighting for our rights either you
[2:37:40.080 --> 2:37:43.040]  believe this or you don't believe this you know
[2:37:43.040 --> 2:37:46.480]  people talk that game but you know you got to walk the walk when it all boils
[2:37:46.480 --> 2:37:48.640]  down to it because they could have done fake charges on you
[2:37:48.640 --> 2:37:51.520]  absolutely it could have hauled me off put me in jail and say you know what i'm
[2:37:51.520 --> 2:37:55.200]  going to charge you with a uh a criminal misdemeanor by the way
[2:37:55.200 --> 2:37:58.640]  please when you have that footage out please bring it to us i'd love to have
[2:37:58.640 --> 2:38:02.080]  back on sunday or monday or owens coming up i mean i know you probably got
[2:38:02.080 --> 2:38:05.440]  footage at your office of this happening no absolutely and so we refuse to do
[2:38:05.440 --> 2:38:08.240]  that so hey we we have a right to be open we're
[2:38:08.240 --> 2:38:10.960]  we are an essential bit i know you're pro law enforcement pro law and order it's
[2:38:10.960 --> 2:38:13.520]  not even they're being ordered to do this by our evil mayor we're trying to
[2:38:13.520 --> 2:38:16.160]  recall but i mean what was it like describe what happened
[2:38:16.160 --> 2:38:19.360]  and it's it's not a it's it's not on them you're absolutely correct because
[2:38:19.360 --> 2:38:22.720]  they're doing their job but it's up to us to know what the laws are and know
[2:38:22.720 --> 2:38:25.840]  that you know what you can you cannot do and you know
[2:38:25.840 --> 2:38:28.560]  don't try to get yourself in trouble yeah don't let it out of control mayor
[2:38:28.560 --> 2:38:31.680]  though have the police engage in illegal operations let them know you're not
[2:38:31.680 --> 2:38:34.720]  doing it that's right and we are not going to comply because that is illegal
[2:38:34.720 --> 2:38:37.280]  and the attorney general just said it was and you got to stand up if you don't
[2:38:37.280 --> 2:38:40.640]  stand up and say something then you know your rights are just going to be taken
[2:38:40.640 --> 2:38:43.680]  away from you and i refuse to let someone take my rights away
[2:38:43.680 --> 2:38:48.720]  either you know i'd rather be judged by by by 12 then then carried by
[2:38:48.720 --> 2:38:53.120]  by six exactly describe what it was like though because i this is i mean i wanted
[2:38:53.120 --> 2:38:55.920]  you on anyways yesterday just about how you were saying i'm not going to shut
[2:38:55.920 --> 2:38:58.720]  down i didn't know they showed up i didn't know that the attorney general just
[2:38:58.720 --> 2:39:01.200]  did this i yeah so they actually walked up walked to the
[2:39:01.200 --> 2:39:04.160]  door i immediately locked the door refused to let him inside
[2:39:04.160 --> 2:39:08.160]  and then i eventually unlocked the door walked outside closed the door behind me
[2:39:08.160 --> 2:39:11.120]  and said hi can i help you they told me what they were there for they've
[2:39:11.120 --> 2:39:14.560]  they received a complaint and that they needed to check and make sure that we
[2:39:14.560 --> 2:39:17.520]  were you know we were in compliance with the law and
[2:39:17.520 --> 2:39:20.480]  that you know we were in a central business so i informed them that we are
[2:39:20.480 --> 2:39:23.680]  in a central business uh because the second member is very essential
[2:39:23.680 --> 2:39:27.040]  you know it's very important till a lot of marriage flies in the bell rides
[2:39:27.040 --> 2:39:31.520]  it's the second amendment for a reason and so they said okay notice we're after
[2:39:31.520 --> 2:39:35.360]  our speech and our guns they just banned me off google
[2:39:35.360 --> 2:39:39.040]  insane insane i mean now they banned our app that was super popular
[2:39:39.040 --> 2:39:43.120]  all because i said trumps right all these doctors say
[2:39:43.120 --> 2:39:46.960]  this hydroxychloroquil is really helping they shouldn't block this and it says
[2:39:46.960 --> 2:39:50.320]  in the article and wired jones complained and said that there were
[2:39:50.320 --> 2:39:54.560]  treatments being blocked that's all over the damn news
[2:39:54.560 --> 2:39:58.080]  uh and it's i don't i don't know how you deal with it i don't know how you put
[2:39:58.080 --> 2:40:00.720]  up with it because you're you're standing strong and i actually like that
[2:40:00.720 --> 2:40:03.840]  about you well i mean we haven't anything wrong so i
[2:40:03.840 --> 2:40:07.520]  don't know what i'm about anyways the good news is you stood up and and
[2:40:07.520 --> 2:40:10.080]  obviously i think because of your case and others do we know why the attorney
[2:40:10.080 --> 2:40:12.640]  general had to take action just because there were so many complaints or what
[2:40:12.640 --> 2:40:14.480]  happened yeah so a state representative out of
[2:40:14.480 --> 2:40:18.640]  Lubbock texas a a dustin boroughs uh he's actually the chair of the house
[2:40:18.640 --> 2:40:20.800]  ways and means committee here in the state of texas
[2:40:20.800 --> 2:40:24.480]  he sent a request over to the attorney general's office asking him to
[2:40:24.480 --> 2:40:28.320]  give an opinion on whether or not your county your city
[2:40:28.320 --> 2:40:31.440]  can actually shut down gun manufacturers and gun stores
[2:40:31.440 --> 2:40:35.440]  the question is will now the city of austin which is might as well be
[2:40:35.440 --> 2:40:39.520]  run by mouse a tongue will they comply yeah and that's the question because
[2:40:39.520 --> 2:40:43.120]  we've seen this before where where an opinion has come down and they refuse
[2:40:43.120 --> 2:40:46.560]  to comply and we've had to beat them in court i did this just last year
[2:40:46.560 --> 2:40:50.400]  where i had to sue the city of austin to allow gun owners to be able to carry
[2:40:50.400 --> 2:40:54.160]  inside the building that's right and and we're like an inch away from going blue
[2:40:54.160 --> 2:40:58.560]  can you imagine living under these people yeah it's it's it's it's amazing
[2:40:58.560 --> 2:41:01.600]  uh it's important texas need to wake up and stop thinking this
[2:41:01.600 --> 2:41:05.760]  the texas is safe it's not people i know the listeners get it but
[2:41:05.760 --> 2:41:09.200]  you better talk to your family in texas another areas they better get up off
[2:41:09.200 --> 2:41:12.320]  their ass because as goes texas we'll go the rest of this country
[2:41:12.320 --> 2:41:15.520]  and we got to get out there and go vote it scares the hell out of me
[2:41:15.520 --> 2:41:18.160]  yeah you're absolutely you're absolutely right alex i got to get out there and
[2:41:18.160 --> 2:41:21.520]  vote because here we are this is what it boils down to right now where we are
[2:41:21.520 --> 2:41:25.600]  right now today if you allow you know these people that you know are in
[2:41:25.600 --> 2:41:30.080]  office to take away your rights your god-given rights right now
[2:41:30.080 --> 2:41:34.160]  then then all is lost and this is it's this is happening right now behind the
[2:41:34.160 --> 2:41:36.880]  scenes is happening all around the country in california they're running a
[2:41:36.880 --> 2:41:39.600]  muck they're shutting them down in california
[2:41:39.600 --> 2:41:43.760]  all together shutting them down can we go in there with one of the tv crews and
[2:41:43.760 --> 2:41:47.280]  uh set you down in the studio and just get you to shoot a report for the war
[2:41:47.280 --> 2:41:49.760]  room because i'm sure they're gonna want that and honestly read the letter
[2:41:49.760 --> 2:41:54.080]  oh absolutely again uh can you come back in sunday or money with an update this
[2:41:54.080 --> 2:41:58.000]  is a big national victory to have the attorney general tell a blue city knock
[2:41:58.000 --> 2:42:01.680]  it off you know guns are essential this is a big national news yeah this is it's
[2:42:01.680 --> 2:42:04.960]  a really big deal because uh you have your and they're doing it all around the
[2:42:04.960 --> 2:42:08.000]  state you know and so it's good that we stopped this right here in texas and
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:10.720]  nipped it in the book how did it end yesterday because they're there the
[2:42:10.720 --> 2:42:14.240]  quadrant forzers the police who else well they figured out that you know one you
[2:42:14.240 --> 2:42:17.120]  know my gun is bigger than theirs and so they've
[2:42:17.120 --> 2:42:20.720]  eventually figured out that we're doing the right thing and they went ahead and left
[2:42:20.720 --> 2:42:24.240]  that was code enforcers police and who else it was actually the fire marshal
[2:42:24.240 --> 2:42:28.000]  the police department and code enforcement all of them at one time
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:32.480]  just their color law just that's right and that's that's how the game is played
[2:42:32.480 --> 2:42:36.880]  well that's the problem the federal law on on infrastructure doesn't mention
[2:42:36.880 --> 2:42:40.960]  guns it needs to be changed right well you you have what the president actually
[2:42:40.960 --> 2:42:44.480]  enacted the staffer deck within the staffer deck if you go to page 99 or
[2:42:44.480 --> 2:42:48.000]  staffer deck it talks about the fact that you cannot confiscate fire

[2:50:25.040 --> 2:50:28.400]  we tell you what's essential we tell you but if you're an illegal alien
[2:50:28.400 --> 2:50:32.000]  or an islamic running around doing everyone you're shut down
[2:50:32.000 --> 2:50:37.600]  and then if you talk about it from your essential media operation
[2:50:37.600 --> 2:50:41.280]  you are banned off an app because you're popular
[2:50:41.280 --> 2:50:45.440]  well we have a way to get an open source app

[2:51:12.480 --> 2:51:15.440]  and now in live time censoring people on facebook twitter the censoring what you
[2:51:15.440 --> 2:51:20.160]  can say what words you can print versus the n word now it's
[2:51:20.160 --> 2:51:23.280]  mother and father on entrance forms for children in school because
[2:51:23.280 --> 2:51:26.000]  some people don't have a mother and father so don't say that it's hurtful
[2:51:26.000 --> 2:51:30.800]  don't say trump can't send out campaign ads saying we're looking for strong
[2:51:30.800 --> 2:51:33.680]  women to join the campaign because maybe a woman saw that is not a woman
[2:51:33.680 --> 2:51:37.520]  i'm not kidding just seeing the word woman is hurtful this is a cult
[2:51:37.520 --> 2:51:41.440]  of control freaks with helpless people that go get college degrees
[2:51:41.440 --> 2:51:44.560]  and learn how to be cult members not how to do anything

[2:58:49.200 --> 2:58:53.040]  storable food orders because the company that supplies us was backed up and was
[2:58:53.040 --> 2:58:56.560]  busy getting out the orders they had now they've opened up two more factories
[2:58:56.560 --> 2:58:59.520]  they've bought a whole bunch more high quality food they're packaging it right
[2:58:59.520 --> 2:59:01.680]  now and they're going to be able to ship it out to you very soon
[2:59:01.680 --> 2:59:05.760]  so get your orders in now every other major food

[3:00:21.200 --> 3:00:24.720]  all right let's go ahead and talk to nick in new york nick you are locked
[3:00:24.720 --> 3:00:29.200]  down aren't you there in the big apple yeah we sure are alex can you hear me
[3:00:29.200 --> 3:00:31.760]  am i coming through clearly loud and clear brother
[3:00:31.760 --> 3:00:34.640]  that's good i'm glad to talk to you it's been a lot it's been a long time i've
[3:00:34.640 --> 3:00:37.600]  actually been listening to info wars for about maybe
[3:00:37.600 --> 3:00:42.320]  you uh i had my red pill moment in uh nine in uh
[3:00:42.320 --> 3:00:46.160]  nine eleven sorry during nine eleven that was uh my red pill moment when i
[3:00:46.160 --> 3:00:50.160]  started listening to you prior to that um i was heavily heavily influenced by
[3:00:50.160 --> 3:00:52.960]  the leftist uh you know radio programs here in the
[3:00:52.960 --> 3:00:56.400]  city and whatnot so it's it's definitively been
[3:00:56.400 --> 3:01:00.160]  uh hell a heck of a journey now i want to i wanted to specify
[3:01:00.160 --> 3:01:03.520]  that for the new listeners actual that you have listening to the show the
[3:01:03.520 --> 3:01:08.080]  reason info wars is so so so important uh is because of
[3:01:08.080 --> 3:01:11.600]  all the different viewpoints that are presented on the platform
[3:01:11.600 --> 3:01:14.800]  and then what happens is that you start listening to the show
[3:01:14.800 --> 3:01:18.400]  and your mind begins to make rational
[3:01:18.400 --> 3:01:22.400]  uh you know connections and you say well wait a minute if this be true then how
[3:01:22.400 --> 3:01:25.600]  could that be true and so you continue listening to
[3:01:25.600 --> 3:01:29.440]  info wars and then you listen to other programs and it's just your the
[3:01:29.440 --> 3:01:32.640]  expansion just begin you know continues from that point
[3:01:32.640 --> 3:01:35.760]  alex i have a couple of things that i'm a little bit concerned about being here
[3:01:35.760 --> 3:01:39.680]  in the city and maybe you could sir i want to get into that for a moment with
[3:01:39.680 --> 3:01:42.160]  you so we'll get back to you but but i wanted to speak about what you're
[3:01:42.160 --> 3:01:46.000]  saying exactly every other program basically has
[3:01:46.000 --> 3:01:50.160]  one point of view or two fake point of views that are basically the same
[3:01:50.160 --> 3:01:53.280]  view curl quickly said we'll give them two choices but really they're the same
[3:01:53.280 --> 3:01:56.720]  thing with different packaging here we have so many different views so many
[3:01:56.720 --> 3:01:59.840]  different ideas we have a real brainstorm a real think tank a real
[3:01:59.840 --> 3:02:03.280]  debate that that gets people who are tuning in to start
[3:02:03.280 --> 3:02:07.600]  thinking like that for themselves which is wide spectrum analysis
[3:02:07.600 --> 3:02:11.040]  and that really is the secret of info wars it's not alex jones it's not
[3:02:11.040 --> 3:02:14.080]  even the callers it's not even all the guests it's all of us together
[3:02:14.080 --> 3:02:17.920]  that college of ideas where it's not all just propaganda
[3:02:17.920 --> 3:02:21.680]  one-dimensional stuff that gets people to think one-dimensionally
[3:02:21.680 --> 3:02:25.520]  uh in in very simple ways instead of looking at things multifaceted
[3:02:25.520 --> 3:02:29.200]  multivariate now different systems interlock different schools of thought
[3:02:29.200 --> 3:02:33.040]  interlock to really give people a realist populist
[3:02:33.040 --> 3:02:38.240]  pro-human uh very in-depth perspective so i'm i appreciate you saying that now
[3:02:38.240 --> 3:02:41.760]  get into your points about the city that that's that's that's absolutely
[3:02:41.760 --> 3:02:44.960]  correct alex what you just said as a matter of fact i wanted i want to jump
[3:02:44.960 --> 3:02:49.840]  another i want to jump it into another group i'm i'm i'm hispanic by uh you
[3:02:49.840 --> 3:02:52.720]  know by by nationality i'm i'm Puerto rican
[3:02:52.720 --> 3:02:56.640]  i'm really spanish i speak spanish very well uh and so
[3:02:56.640 --> 3:03:01.200]  therefore i want to just i want to just uh lay out a quick a quick
[3:03:01.200 --> 3:03:05.360]  platform here you've got many people within the spanish community
[3:03:05.360 --> 3:03:10.240]  particularly here in the city who are beginning to see and ask
[3:03:10.240 --> 3:03:13.040]  questions and i'm gonna tell you what the questions that they're asking
[3:03:13.040 --> 3:03:15.680]  they're saying they're saying to themselves and to others
[3:03:15.680 --> 3:03:19.360]  we don't understand how it's even a conceivable possibility
[3:03:19.360 --> 3:03:23.920]  that the person who is in the white house the orange man who's out to destroy
[3:03:23.920 --> 3:03:28.000]  the united states is actually the one that's out there saying listen
[3:03:28.000 --> 3:03:31.360]  uh we got to get this come we got to get this country back up and going because
[3:03:31.360 --> 3:03:35.600]  a lot of the people who are being affected by this are small business
[3:03:35.600 --> 3:03:39.360]  owners who i personally know that are being affected by this what you're
[3:03:39.360 --> 3:03:43.280]  saying is it's so transparent that the globalists want to stall the country
[3:03:43.280 --> 3:03:47.680]  it's so obvious that trump has our best interests at heart that's 110 percent
[3:03:47.680 --> 3:03:50.960]  now some of these people alex they don't even speak english
[3:03:50.960 --> 3:03:54.400]  and they're saying i'm gonna vote for trump i'm gonna vote for trump these are
[3:03:54.400 --> 3:03:59.440]  some of the people that i've been that i've spoken to now on another note on
[3:03:59.440 --> 3:04:03.120]  another note there are some concerns that you know we have there are good
[3:04:03.120 --> 3:04:07.040]  people in a lot of these blue cities which are the main hub point of control
[3:04:07.040 --> 3:04:11.200]  by the globalist and others that have cited sir i know that they don't have
[3:04:11.200 --> 3:04:14.080]  real elections i know people hate the globalist in blue cities
[3:04:14.080 --> 3:04:18.320]  most folks are great in blue cities we understand that exactly so
[3:04:18.320 --> 3:04:22.320]  moving on to the next point from that is i want i want to ask our president i want
[3:04:22.320 --> 3:04:26.720]  to ask donald trump because listen he didn't create this situation and he's
[3:04:26.720 --> 3:04:31.040]  not some you know junior god or whatever but i listen carefully to what he says
[3:04:31.040 --> 3:04:34.480]  and one thing i gotta say is donald trump has one big
[3:04:34.480 --> 3:04:38.640]  damn ego in a good way in a good way alex he has a very big ego and i'm gonna
[3:04:38.640 --> 3:04:40.880]  tell you one thing he's not going down with this
[3:04:40.880 --> 3:04:47.760]  shit okay go ahead explain that when we come back

[3:06:06.560 --> 3:06:09.680]  the police aren't our enemy it's the bureaucrats it's the globalists
[3:06:09.680 --> 3:06:12.480]  trying to order them to carry out unconstitutional orders
[3:06:12.480 --> 3:06:15.200]  right here in Austin they told gun shops to close
[3:06:15.200 --> 3:06:20.240]  and some didn't they defied it and the globalists didn't know what to do
[3:06:20.240 --> 3:06:24.080]  so the attorney general came out and said it was illegal what they were doing
[3:06:24.080 --> 3:06:27.040]  modern book burners are here ladies and gentlemen
[3:06:27.040 --> 3:06:38.960]  and we've got to say no to it
[3:06:38.960 --> 3:06:42.240]  all right ladies and gentlemen we're gonna go ahead and go back
[3:06:42.240 --> 3:06:45.680]  to nick in new york he was saying he's concerned about one thing he said
[3:06:45.680 --> 3:06:50.000]  trumps got a huge ego but he's afraid trump won't go down with the ship
[3:06:50.000 --> 3:06:54.160]  quantify that go ahead if you have trump thinks america is too
[3:06:54.160 --> 3:06:57.600]  dumb to be saved or are you saying he's gonna pull something or what are you
[3:06:57.600 --> 3:07:00.560]  getting at no no alex that's not my point at all what i'm
[3:07:00.560 --> 3:07:03.280]  what i'm trying to say is that everybody knows that then i'm not gonna
[3:07:03.280 --> 3:07:07.600]  say everybody a large majority of some of somewhat informed and very well
[3:07:07.600 --> 3:07:11.440]  informed individuals know that this situation you know it just isn't
[3:07:11.440 --> 3:07:14.960]  mechanized like that isn't this sickness it doesn't create itself you
[3:07:14.960 --> 3:07:17.440]  don't find these elements in in just regular organic
[3:07:17.440 --> 3:07:20.720]  situations based on a lot of the people you've had on your show that have
[3:07:20.720 --> 3:07:24.080]  you know explained this information and all this other stuff so we can see
[3:07:24.080 --> 3:07:26.800]  that there's something more going on here and then now we're talking about a
[3:07:26.800 --> 3:07:29.600]  couple calls ago you said that they're gonna be you know
[3:07:29.600 --> 3:07:32.960]  be male being the mailers so people can vote that way i mean this is
[3:07:32.960 --> 3:07:36.720]  definitively some type of a power grab and we can see that what i'm saying
[3:07:36.720 --> 3:07:43.760]  here is that trump's platform was you know promises made promises kept
[3:07:43.760 --> 3:07:48.160]  on that same whole idea was that let's make america great again
[3:07:48.160 --> 3:07:52.000]  and there's many people that subscribe to that part of that is opening up the
[3:07:52.000 --> 3:07:54.800]  country and not letting this thing fall any
[3:07:54.800 --> 3:07:58.640]  further into a spiraling effect that's going to destroy the entire thing
[3:07:58.640 --> 3:08:03.440]  well that's what i'm saying if he doesn't do what he says that he's going to do
[3:08:03.440 --> 3:08:06.560]  or rather if if the people that are surrounding him
[3:08:06.560 --> 3:08:11.840]  don't make moves to open this up and get this engine going and then i'm
[3:08:11.840 --> 3:08:16.080]  hearing on some other level you know some other some by some other call
[3:08:16.080 --> 3:08:18.880]  people that been on your show and in other places
[3:08:18.880 --> 3:08:22.560]  you know the blue cities are not going to open up like that
[3:08:22.560 --> 3:08:28.240]  so there's going to be a stranglehold on a lot of of of of of blood flow if we
[3:08:28.240 --> 3:08:30.960]  want to if you want to use that that's what i called it is
[3:08:30.960 --> 3:08:34.080]  there's a showdown because they're holding the blue cities hostage
[3:08:34.080 --> 3:08:37.040]  which are the main hubs of the country that's what the globalists took those
[3:08:37.040 --> 3:08:41.440]  over with election fraud to hold the country hostage this is a strategic
[3:08:41.440 --> 3:08:43.840]  takeover and you're absolutely right god bless you
[3:08:43.840 --> 3:08:47.520]  all right i'm going to go to jordan lander and chase in closing
[3:08:47.520 --> 3:08:51.520]  but i need to go ahead and hit this right now
[3:08:51.520 --> 3:08:55.600]  info wars has chronicled the last 26 years
[3:08:55.600 --> 3:08:59.120]  the globalist plan for world government the globalist plan to replace humans
[3:08:59.120 --> 3:09:02.880]  with robots the system of suppression and a post human
[3:09:02.880 --> 3:09:06.240]  world and as everything we warned about control
[3:09:06.240 --> 3:09:10.160]  bio weapon attacks to bring in world government come into place and
[3:09:10.160 --> 3:09:13.280]  world leaders say we want world government to control you and
[3:09:13.280 --> 3:09:19.040]  Rockefeller white papers come out that say
[3:09:19.040 --> 3:09:23.360]  that they're going to use global bio weapon releases
[3:09:23.360 --> 3:09:27.120]  to bring in tyranny
[3:09:27.600 --> 3:09:32.640]  as all of what we've talked about emerges it was always true but now is it
[3:09:32.640 --> 3:09:38.080]  emerges publicly as they go from hiding it to selling it
[3:09:38.080 --> 3:09:43.120]  as our guest said yesterday they have to silence the voices that were right
[3:09:43.120 --> 3:09:46.640]  because the credibility is going straight up
[3:09:46.640 --> 3:09:50.640]  and it's a message to others you keep your mouth shut
[3:09:50.640 --> 3:09:53.440]  and you don't say the things alex jones said
[3:09:53.440 --> 3:09:57.680]  or you're next and then they silence themselves
[3:09:57.680 --> 3:10:01.360]  and other silence themselves they self censor what's popular what's common
[3:10:01.360 --> 3:10:04.800]  sense what the people want and then next there's another demand
[3:10:04.800 --> 3:10:10.160]  and more you've got to do there's never enough with this social credit score so
[3:10:10.160 --> 3:10:13.760]  google bans info wars android app over coronavirus claims
[3:10:13.760 --> 3:10:19.280]  and it says they banned me for saying that i thought they were hyping the
[3:10:19.280 --> 3:10:22.480]  virus and that i disputed social distancing
[3:10:22.480 --> 3:10:26.080]  shelter in place and quarantine efforts meant to slow the spread of the novel
[3:10:26.080 --> 3:10:30.080]  coronavirus well so is the president
[3:10:30.080 --> 3:10:33.760]  then they go on to say jones said don't be scared there are a lot of
[3:10:33.760 --> 3:10:38.480]  promising treatments vitamin c hydroxy
[3:10:38.480 --> 3:10:43.920]  chloroquine and others i was reading mainstream news
[3:10:43.920 --> 3:10:47.760]  myland producing potential covet 19 treatment in west virginia
[3:10:47.760 --> 3:10:54.320]  wd tv i've got ap i've got norvadas and others to supply

[3:22:14.480 --> 3:22:18.800]  the real dangerous is the gain of function that's 99 percent of the
[3:22:18.800 --> 3:22:22.720]  purpose of this virus the blue cities know that

[3:23:27.120 --> 3:23:30.000]  treatments of the virus that has two purposes
[3:23:30.000 --> 3:23:33.440]  one if we don't know the treatments of the virus the hospitals are more likely
[3:23:33.440 --> 3:23:35.760]  to be overwhelmed everybody needs to get treatments
[3:23:35.760 --> 3:23:40.320]  for themselves and their family members well yeah you know what they censor you
[3:23:40.320 --> 3:23:43.920]  for is what they're afraid of i'm not a doctor i'm the trumps up there talking
[3:23:43.920 --> 3:23:47.680]  about hydroxychloroquil the in europe they said it worked really great
[3:23:47.680 --> 3:23:50.800]  i'm saying zinc i'm saying that's what the doctors are saying we're not supposed
[3:23:50.800 --> 3:23:52.720]  to say what the doctors are saying they want us
[3:23:52.720 --> 3:23:57.600]  hopeless all these democrat governors have blocked uh their their doctors with
[3:23:57.600 --> 3:24:01.200]  degrees trying to prescribe that and the second reason
[3:24:01.200 --> 3:24:04.080]  they're so upset with your discussion of the treatment
[3:24:04.080 --> 3:24:08.880]  is that this uh coronavirus weapon is not very dangerous in the non-binary
[3:24:08.880 --> 3:24:13.760]  configuration um this you know the more important
[3:24:13.760 --> 3:24:18.880]  part of this weapon system is the panic and the real treatment for the panic
[3:24:18.880 --> 3:24:21.920]  is studying the truth that's what you're spreading
[3:24:21.920 --> 3:24:25.760]  and they want people at home away from their churches away from the light of
[3:24:25.760 --> 3:24:30.080]  sun only interfacing with their digital devices
[3:24:30.080 --> 3:24:33.520]  that's right this is a globalist ai rape of the public
[3:24:33.520 --> 3:24:36.320]  plug them with whatever they're sending out on the wavelengths right now in the
[3:24:36.320 --> 3:24:39.280]  flicker rate you know a bunch of stuff's going on right now this is
[3:24:39.280 --> 3:24:41.920]  this is their attempt and they're pissed they're losing
[3:24:41.920 --> 3:24:45.200]  yeah we can feel the waves coming in and it's you know being locked in your
[3:24:45.200 --> 3:24:48.080]  house it's not so different from sensory deprivation that's a pretty well
[3:24:48.080 --> 3:24:50.560]  known technique well it's coming out we're having huge
[3:24:50.560 --> 3:24:55.600]  divorces suicides fights breakups drug overdoses alcoholism this is all
[3:24:55.600 --> 3:25:00.080]  a huge unhealthy event and so it's either run with the hill jump off cliffs
[3:25:00.080 --> 3:25:03.360]  or nothing's wrong that that's not the two camps
[3:25:03.360 --> 3:25:06.000]  that's not what i'm saying that's not what people like mike saying there aren't
[3:25:06.000 --> 3:25:09.200]  two camps on that mike comes and guests host the show and probably come on
[3:25:09.200 --> 3:25:11.440]  next week i mean it's it's ridiculous it's a
[3:25:11.440 --> 3:25:14.880]  false dichotomy we're the ones that said it's coming
[3:25:14.880 --> 3:25:18.320]  it's going to be a big deal get ready but now them trying to hype it to create
[3:25:18.320 --> 3:25:21.840]  as much fear to kill confidence no we can handle what happens
[3:25:21.840 --> 3:25:24.880]  we're going to deal with it as americans and we're going to find out what's
[3:25:24.880 --> 3:25:28.880]  about to happen i think the death rate is going to be 30 40 50 000
[3:25:28.880 --> 3:25:32.480]  they're going to call the flu deaths the same thing maybe say it's 80 90 000
[3:25:32.480 --> 3:25:35.600]  and but then just fear monger till that's the end of the world
[3:25:35.600 --> 3:25:38.560]  god bless you lander all right chase the patriot thanks for holding your
[3:25:38.560 --> 3:25:44.000]  rtell gunner before dr nick baggage of earth rising takes over
[3:25:44.000 --> 3:25:47.440]  hey thanks for taking my call alex you know whenever these major events are
[3:25:47.440 --> 3:25:50.080]  going on you got all the politicians and all the media
[3:25:50.080 --> 3:25:53.120]  and they want everybody looking over here i'm trying to figure out what are
[3:25:53.120 --> 3:25:56.960]  they trying to slip under the table so i you know i'm recently if you think
[3:25:56.960 --> 3:26:00.080]  back in 2016 during the summertime and the
[3:26:00.080 --> 3:26:03.200]  heat of the election the debates between president trump and hillary
[3:26:03.200 --> 3:26:07.680]  clinton they released the 28 pages to the 9 11 report when nobody was really
[3:26:07.680 --> 3:26:10.400]  paying attention and super bowl times when they
[3:26:10.400 --> 3:26:13.760]  always try to release their new budget deal they always try to sneak things
[3:26:13.760 --> 3:26:17.120]  through and so now you know i'm trying to connect some of the dots
[3:26:17.120 --> 3:26:20.480]  and our civil liberties have not been attacked as much as they
[3:26:20.480 --> 3:26:24.240]  were from the events at 9 11 and if you think about it in a way you know we've
[3:26:24.240 --> 3:26:27.120]  kind of connected so many of these together but
[3:26:27.120 --> 3:26:30.800]  towards the end of the year in december the university of alasco
[3:26:30.800 --> 3:26:33.760]  just released the report about building number seven
[3:26:33.760 --> 3:26:37.680]  contradicting the federal government's report and there was the
[3:26:37.680 --> 3:26:41.440]  victims families of 9 11 also seeking all the evidence
[3:26:41.440 --> 3:26:45.120]  and there were more and more dominoes falling to really open up and see what
[3:26:45.120 --> 3:26:48.880]  was going on for 9 11 and so i see this as maybe a way
[3:26:48.880 --> 3:26:53.520]  to turn the attention to have everybody looking over here for months at this big
[3:26:53.520 --> 3:26:56.720]  coronavirus and now you know the senate and the house
[3:26:56.720 --> 3:27:00.320]  for months if not years will be investigating how did it happen
[3:27:00.320 --> 3:27:04.960]  what was the response who should be held responsible and we should do that
[3:27:04.960 --> 3:27:09.440]  but really the way they can control the media control the narrative and try to
[3:27:09.440 --> 3:27:12.640]  hide the truth that's what i'm trying to figure out
[3:27:12.640 --> 3:27:16.080]  and so you know on on my show people are calling in and they're trying to figure
[3:27:16.080 --> 3:27:19.200]  out you know what's the big take is it just oh yeah they're trying to redo
[3:27:19.200 --> 3:27:21.840]  the patriot act they're trying to ram through
[3:27:21.840 --> 3:27:24.800]  the 20 something trillion missing at the pentagon and they want to get rid of
[3:27:24.800 --> 3:27:29.040]  trump you're absolutely right chase the patriot you're dead on
[3:27:29.040 --> 3:27:31.920]  yeah and one more thing for you earlier in the show you were talking about
[3:27:31.920 --> 3:27:35.760]  finding your sword to attack satan and that's straight from the bible
[3:27:35.760 --> 3:27:41.360]  luke 2236 he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and go buy one god
[3:27:41.360 --> 3:27:45.040]  bless you alex keep doing what you do chase tell folks how they find your show

[3:30:04.800 --> 3:30:08.880]  a year into office you'll be saying wow i remember that interview he said he was
[3:30:08.880 --> 3:30:12.080]  going to do it and he did a great job you'll be very proud of our country
[3:30:12.080 --> 3:30:15.840]  four years ago then billionaire businessman
[3:30:15.840 --> 3:30:20.320]  donald trump pledged himself to info wars in our audience
[3:30:20.320 --> 3:30:24.000]  that he would not let us down that he would take the globalist on
[3:30:24.000 --> 3:30:27.440]  and that we would be very pleased with what he did
[3:30:27.440 --> 3:30:32.160]  we are pleased with president trump he has proven that he's the real deal
[3:30:32.160 --> 3:30:35.920]  and has taken the globalist on a level never before seen
[3:30:35.920 --> 3:30:39.600]  but now they're striking back at president trump and the people
[3:30:39.600 --> 3:30:42.880]  using the invisible weapon of fear the coronavirus
[3:30:42.880 --> 3:30:46.160]  yes we should meet the virus head on yes we should
[3:30:46.160 --> 3:30:49.760]  save as many people as possible but not at the expense of our hard-fought
[3:30:49.760 --> 3:30:54.080]  liberties and freedoms one of our best-selling products is living
[3:30:54.080 --> 3:30:58.080]  defense and it's been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source
[3:30:58.080 --> 3:31:01.120]  the ingredients that are organic we've got a limited supply right now but it's
[3:31:01.120 --> 3:31:04.560]  selling out fast and i want those of you that haven't experienced living defense
[3:31:04.560 --> 3:31:07.120]  to get it for yourself here's just part of one testimonial
[3:31:07.120 --> 3:31:11.360]  i looked in january 2016 i went in the hospital i went to va hospital
[3:31:11.360 --> 3:31:14.720]  out here in boise and i was in there until june and one of the only things that
[3:31:14.720 --> 3:31:19.280]  got me through that ordeal was listening to info wars three hours a day and i
[3:31:19.280 --> 3:31:22.960]  kept hearing dr grove and all you guys talking about living defense let me
[3:31:22.960 --> 3:31:26.400]  case that man i had an internal digestive problem and i
[3:31:26.400 --> 3:31:31.440]  suffered with it for about five or six years and the doctors they tried every
[3:31:31.440 --> 3:31:33.840]  time nobody could figure out what it is and then every day when i kept hearing you
[3:31:33.840 --> 3:31:37.040]  and dr grove and those commercials i said you know what i'm gonna get me some of
[3:31:37.040 --> 3:31:39.360]  that freaking living defense now i wasn't supposed to have any
[3:31:39.360 --> 3:31:42.320]  nutritional because they don't want you to have a stuff but i ordered it had it
[3:31:42.320 --> 3:31:46.400]  chip to me i got it i hid it from the nurses i started taking it man that
[3:31:46.400 --> 3:31:52.000]  stuff changed my life it saved my life alex jones and info wars saved my life
[3:31:52.000 --> 3:31:57.600]  every week every day every hour every minute every second
[3:31:57.600 --> 3:32:01.440]  right now is critical history is happening right in front of us
[3:32:01.440 --> 3:32:05.200]  and we can't be spectators we've got to be men and women in the arena regardless
[3:32:05.200 --> 3:32:08.560]  of race color creed age sexual privacy it doesn't matter
[3:32:08.560 --> 3:32:12.240]  the globalist with the chai comms and others are openly trying to plunge
[3:32:12.240 --> 3:32:16.160]  our economy and start a new depression china who hyped up this virus is now
[3:32:16.160 --> 3:32:19.120]  back to work and ramping up their economy while ours
[3:32:19.120 --> 3:32:23.200]  is going into a freefall spiral and trump's desperately trying to restart it
[3:32:23.200 --> 3:32:27.600]  and create confidence and the globalist corporate media that was worshiping china
[3:32:27.600 --> 3:32:31.040]  just a month or so ago and their response is saying trump
[3:32:31.040 --> 3:32:35.200]  is terrible because they want america to fail they want you to fail
[3:32:35.200 --> 3:32:38.800]  but you can expose them you can speak out you can share the articles and
[3:32:38.800 --> 3:32:42.800]  videos and reports at info wars and bandot video that expose them
[3:32:42.800 --> 3:32:46.800]  and the globalist will go down it's already blowing up in their face right
[3:32:46.800 --> 3:32:52.400]  now so press the attack on the info war and defeat the nwo
[3:32:55.120 --> 3:33:00.400]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:00.400 --> 3:33:20.080]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind with nick baggage
[3:33:24.400 --> 3:33:28.080]  and welcome back and it's good to be here on this
[3:33:28.080 --> 3:33:32.240]  friday afternoon and we're headed into the afternoon my part of the world and
[3:33:32.240 --> 3:33:36.080]  in the afternoon for the rest of the country you know i'm here in elastida
[3:33:36.080 --> 3:33:41.440]  today and and we're on this topic of the virus because there's nothing else
[3:33:41.440 --> 3:33:45.040]  to talk about apparently in the world right now and this is critical
[3:33:45.040 --> 3:33:48.800]  because expecting everybody one way or another and and i want to talk a little
[3:33:48.800 --> 3:33:54.720]  bit about the perceptions because i think some of this is really relevant
[3:33:54.720 --> 3:33:59.200]  and the and they call her in the last segment that alex was talking with
[3:33:59.200 --> 3:34:02.880]  that talks about two camps there really isn't two camps there's just a lot of
[3:34:02.880 --> 3:34:07.120]  different perspectives being added into this situation i think that's a better
[3:34:07.120 --> 3:34:11.040]  way to look at this it's not one or the other it's like let's get the
[3:34:11.040 --> 3:34:15.600]  information let's all make good judgments but recognize that when these
[3:34:15.600 --> 3:34:18.960]  things happen people's playbooks come off the
[3:34:18.960 --> 3:34:23.760]  shelf and it's not like people haven't been waiting for the opportunity alex
[3:34:23.760 --> 3:34:28.720]  represented the rockefeller work 10 years ago
[3:34:28.720 --> 3:34:32.560]  gates work a year ago i mean there's a lot of people who have looked at these
[3:34:32.560 --> 3:34:36.320]  scenarios of futurists in the pentagon have looked at these
[3:34:36.320 --> 3:34:40.720]  scenarios and develop game plans and so the game plan
[3:34:40.720 --> 3:34:44.240]  is in action for corporations for companies for
[3:34:44.240 --> 3:34:48.400]  businesses around the world that built plans and corporations and i guarantee
[3:34:48.400 --> 3:34:52.240]  you a globalists have thought about this because
[3:34:52.240 --> 3:34:56.480]  disaster breeds opportunity for bad actors which i said the last time i was
[3:34:56.480 --> 3:35:00.960]  on the broadcast a couple weeks ago you know when i think about this
[3:35:00.960 --> 3:35:05.280]  again sort of what's happening with this perception let's talk about that a
[3:35:05.280 --> 3:35:07.600]  little bit because i talk a lot about the brain
[3:35:07.600 --> 3:35:11.360]  and how the brain works and the intellectual side
[3:35:11.360 --> 3:35:15.040]  the left side of the brain is analyzing all the data
[3:35:15.040 --> 3:35:18.160]  everybody's doing it alex is doing it i'm doing it
[3:35:18.160 --> 3:35:22.000]  mike is doing it everybody's doing it and as we analyze the data what we don't
[3:35:22.000 --> 3:35:26.480]  have is the experience in this particular set of
[3:35:26.480 --> 3:35:31.040]  scenarios so we don't have the full right brain connection on the emotional
[3:35:31.040 --> 3:35:34.160]  side because that'll come later and that's why people are saying
[3:35:34.160 --> 3:35:38.320]  hey when you'll really feel the emotion of it is when the news feeds start
[3:35:38.320 --> 3:35:40.960]  telling us there's no room at the end at the hospital
[3:35:40.960 --> 3:35:45.520]  i believe that's true because then our immediate experience emotionally connects
[3:35:45.520 --> 3:35:48.320]  with the intellectual and then the flood
[3:35:48.320 --> 3:35:51.200]  happens and we go into the flight or fight response that
[3:35:51.200 --> 3:35:54.560]  mike was talking about with alex a few weeks ago now
[3:35:54.560 --> 3:35:59.760]  that's important to engage the battle to get the alert signal we all got alert
[3:35:59.760 --> 3:36:04.400]  signals now so it's again stay calm as the propaganda
[3:36:04.400 --> 3:36:07.280]  continues and the opportunity for these guys
[3:36:07.280 --> 3:36:10.800]  continues and here's the biggest thing that happened
[3:36:10.800 --> 3:36:14.400]  they got mentioned and i think i got stomped out of the media really rapidly
[3:36:14.400 --> 3:36:17.120]  and i i don't want to see that happen because it's a big thing and it's something
[3:36:17.120 --> 3:36:21.120]  you need to remember how much money is involved in this fix
[3:36:21.120 --> 3:36:23.440]  and i'm not saying it's the right amount the wrong amount i just want to make
[3:36:23.440 --> 3:36:28.720]  sure everybody knows what it is it's two trillion from the federal government
[3:36:28.720 --> 3:36:33.200]  and four trillion minimum from the federal reserve
[3:36:33.200 --> 3:36:39.200]  okay that's six trillion dollars divided by 350 million people in america
[3:36:39.200 --> 3:36:45.520]  and that equals 17 thousand dollars per person okay let me say that again that
[3:36:45.520 --> 3:36:50.720]  17 thousand dollars per person 68 thousand dollars
[3:36:50.720 --> 3:36:55.760]  per family of four being thrown into the paper creation of the fed
[3:36:55.760 --> 3:37:02.000]  and the government's contribution to this mess now when you think about that
[3:37:02.000 --> 3:37:06.080]  that's a huge amount of money and then you want to keep in mind the trickle down
[3:37:06.080 --> 3:37:10.240]  effect because what lands on the plate of the average house
[3:37:10.240 --> 3:37:17.120]  is going to be that $1,250 per adult so and the only reason i raise all this
[3:37:17.120 --> 3:37:20.480]  is i'm not saying those are good things or the right things but this is part of
[3:37:20.480 --> 3:37:24.800]  the panic party that's going on right now that that people aren't fully
[3:37:24.800 --> 3:37:28.880]  registering and where's some of that money going you know some of the pork
[3:37:28.880 --> 3:37:32.160]  packed into that program is like for the kennedy
[3:37:32.160 --> 3:37:36.400]  a performing arts center and before the show i looked up how much tickets cost
[3:37:36.400 --> 3:37:40.000]  and for the tickets are selling for may 15th for the opera
[3:37:40.000 --> 3:37:44.160]  you can get seats for between 113 and 205 bucks
[3:37:44.160 --> 3:37:48.240]  each now i know most families of four that i know
[3:37:48.240 --> 3:37:52.400]  can't afford 113 dollar tickets even out without a virus
[3:37:52.400 --> 3:37:56.480]  you know much less 205 each but that's what we're dealing with and money's
[3:37:56.480 --> 3:37:59.600]  being forked in you know and the same for the public
[3:37:59.600 --> 3:38:02.880]  broadcasting system and a lot of other things that got
[3:38:02.880 --> 3:38:09.840]  forked into this bill to inflate it to 68 thousand dollars per family of four
[3:38:09.840 --> 3:38:13.440]  and making sure those families of four have 10 percent
[3:38:13.440 --> 3:38:17.120]  or less of that flowing into their actual household
[3:38:17.120 --> 3:38:21.040]  and yet we're straddled with the debt at the end of the day
[3:38:21.040 --> 3:38:24.800]  you know we have to sort out the mess or the inflation that comes after so we
[3:38:24.800 --> 3:38:29.440]  absorb debt a new way by devaluing the currency of our savings
[3:38:29.440 --> 3:38:32.800]  and what's left of them if there's any at all
[3:38:32.800 --> 3:38:38.080]  you know so keep all of this in mind as the panic party moves forward because
[3:38:38.080 --> 3:38:43.680]  panic breeds the hurting mentality number one and it gives
[3:38:43.680 --> 3:38:47.760]  powers that be the opportunity to push us around a whole lot more
[3:38:47.760 --> 3:38:52.400]  and i say stand firm be respectful be respectful
[3:38:52.400 --> 3:38:58.320]  of what we are and i say it every week in one form or another because by
[3:38:58.320 --> 3:39:00.880]  respecting ourselves and respecting others in the midst
[3:39:00.880 --> 3:39:05.040]  of crisis we add calm where panic is all around us
[3:39:05.040 --> 3:39:10.560]  that's who we are at the tip of the spear everyone listening is the center
[3:39:10.560 --> 3:39:14.480]  of that storm calm in the calm well it's all
[3:39:14.480 --> 3:39:18.240]  breaking around us so that we keep moving forward
[3:39:18.240 --> 3:39:22.480]  not with a herd but with a plan an individual plan for ourselves our
[3:39:22.480 --> 3:39:27.360]  families our neighborhoods our friends people around us that's how we take
[3:39:27.360 --> 3:39:31.600]  back what has been taken from us in the squishy collective
[3:39:31.600 --> 3:39:35.680]  and this actually you know trauma i've talked about trauma in my own personal
[3:39:35.680 --> 3:39:40.000]  life i talked about my dad's death and other segments on the show in the past
[3:39:40.000 --> 3:39:47.040]  and how traumatizing that was for me at 14 but at the same time
[3:39:47.040 --> 3:39:51.280]  how transformative it was for me in changing me
[3:39:51.280 --> 3:39:56.080]  fundamentally what i was able to do how i looked at the world the choices i made
[3:39:56.080 --> 3:40:01.440]  we are all in a slow motion trauma right now no matter how we're perceiving this
[3:40:01.440 --> 3:40:05.520]  real or unreal illusionary or not it doesn't matter because it's affecting
[3:40:05.520 --> 3:40:08.800]  us and it will for months and months to come
[3:40:08.800 --> 3:40:13.120]  perhaps even years to come what we don't want to lose in this is more liberty
[3:40:13.120 --> 3:40:17.920]  and freedom we don't want to lose more of what our
[3:40:17.920 --> 3:40:24.080]  self created god created images of us are you know which is about freedom about
[3:40:24.080 --> 3:40:27.840]  liberty about doing we need to retain that
[3:40:27.840 --> 3:40:31.520]  at the end of this tunnel and make sure we enhance that
[3:40:31.520 --> 3:40:35.280]  and now when we're in dialogue with each other our families yeah there's
[3:40:35.280 --> 3:40:39.440]  crisis in some households we haven't talked to each other in a long time
[3:40:39.440 --> 3:40:42.640]  but for most people this is an opportunity to come closer
[3:40:42.640 --> 3:40:45.680]  to your families come closer to those that are
[3:40:45.680 --> 3:40:50.000]  in your sphere of influence because now we have the greatest commodity the most
[3:40:50.000 --> 3:40:55.600]  valuable thing that god ever gave us time our lives our breath
[3:40:55.600 --> 3:41:01.040]  let's use that now let's apply our the breath of life that we each have in what
[3:41:01.040 --> 3:41:05.440]  we do each day to lift our families up to lift each other up at a time when
[3:41:05.440 --> 3:41:09.760]  everybody's running around fearful and scared and we understand it
[3:41:09.760 --> 3:41:13.360]  we're all going to cycle through that me included you know because
[3:41:13.360 --> 3:41:17.040]  you get lost in an occasional and you got to remember and here's a trick about
[3:41:17.040 --> 3:41:21.040]  controlling fear this is a really simple
[3:41:21.040 --> 3:41:24.400]  technique at a time when we need it i taught it to my
[3:41:24.400 --> 3:41:28.000]  daughter when she was 10 it works great works good for everyone
[3:41:28.000 --> 3:41:33.200]  when emotions begin to overwhelm you where you feel you're on that way being
[3:41:33.200 --> 3:41:40.240]  pushed along by this overwhelming fear stop
[3:41:40.240 --> 3:41:44.160]  breathe think about the fear you're feeling
[3:41:44.160 --> 3:41:47.920]  and as soon as you pay attention to it you actually
[3:41:47.920 --> 3:41:53.360]  gain control of it this is where the intellectual side begins to interact
[3:41:53.360 --> 3:41:57.600]  again with the emotional side not letting one run off without the other
[3:41:57.600 --> 3:42:02.720]  that's why god gave us two hemispheres so we have both working with each other
[3:42:02.720 --> 3:42:08.400]  this is what we need in time of trouble we need everything that we are
[3:42:08.400 --> 3:42:12.240]  working as it was intended and designed and perfection
[3:42:12.240 --> 3:42:15.840]  to deal with crisis whether it's the lion jumping out
[3:42:15.840 --> 3:42:19.680]  or the ai coming at us you know this is an important time
[3:42:19.680 --> 3:42:24.080]  i've talked about control i've talked about mind control and how social
[3:42:24.080 --> 3:42:27.760]  control works we are at a time when there are
[3:42:27.760 --> 3:42:32.320]  big powers about to unleash and have unleashed their game plans
[3:42:32.320 --> 3:42:35.520]  coming into the last section of the show today i want to talk about what that
[3:42:35.520 --> 3:42:39.200]  might look like i want to talk about some historical context

[3:47:22.960 --> 3:47:27.200]  and welcome back it's good to be here today on this Friday morning in my
[3:47:27.200 --> 3:47:31.200]  part of the world still in the afternoon across the rest of the country you know
[3:47:31.200 --> 3:47:36.160]  when i think about all of this the control that's being imposed you know
[3:47:36.160 --> 3:47:39.680]  whether it be the control of the media and more controls on speech which is
[3:47:39.680 --> 3:47:42.560]  coming the democrats attempt to try and create
[3:47:42.560 --> 3:47:47.200]  electronic currency i mean good grief you know i was talking about this a few
[3:47:47.200 --> 3:47:50.000]  weeks ago i can't remember whether it was on one of these segments or another
[3:47:50.000 --> 3:47:55.040]  show out there in the world but just thinking about all this you know i was
[3:47:55.040 --> 3:47:58.320]  talking on i was on radio for an hour and a half in israel and throughout the
[3:47:58.320 --> 3:48:01.600]  middle east a couple days ago talking to folks everyone's
[3:48:01.600 --> 3:48:05.840]  experiencing the same way and the rollout of control is being handled in
[3:48:05.840 --> 3:48:10.400]  the same way i talked to people in asia europe the middle east all over
[3:48:10.400 --> 3:48:15.520]  and the rollout is the same and i've said for a couple years now everything's
[3:48:15.520 --> 3:48:19.840]  being tailored for cultural and political correctness so it fits into
[3:48:19.840 --> 3:48:25.360]  whatever's going on within your sphere but the thing i would say too is um a
[3:48:25.360 --> 3:48:28.800]  cashless society it's going to be a dangerous society you know they have
[3:48:28.800 --> 3:48:31.920]  negative interest rates on savings in europe that
[3:48:31.920 --> 3:48:34.560]  happens here then all of your money is going to have the
[3:48:34.560 --> 3:48:37.600]  invisible tax of negative interest rates and every
[3:48:37.600 --> 3:48:41.360]  transaction that you do uh under the guise of safety and
[3:48:41.360 --> 3:48:46.240]  security is going to be tracked and everything that you do is going to be
[3:48:46.240 --> 3:48:50.960]  scrutinized by somebody who decides who you are what you are what you're about
[3:48:50.960 --> 3:48:55.120]  and then begins to manipulate you at even a higher level as they track
[3:48:55.120 --> 3:48:58.320]  every aspect of your life the same is true for the
[3:48:58.320 --> 3:49:01.760]  the initiatives and cell phones they already have the ability now they're
[3:49:01.760 --> 3:49:04.960]  going to make it oh wait it's important you know
[3:49:04.960 --> 3:49:08.720]  joe blow got the virus now we got to track everybody and everybody that went
[3:49:08.720 --> 3:49:14.400]  by him and so we can track everybody for your safety and security

[3:49:20.720 --> 3:49:24.560]  don't give up your liberty for the illusion of safety and security
[3:49:24.560 --> 3:49:30.640]  don't give up your freedom for the bs being pumped out all over the world
[3:49:30.640 --> 3:49:35.520]  the fact that the economic collapse is happening isn't because of a virus
[3:49:35.520 --> 3:49:40.000]  it's because of bad policy everybody knew it
[3:49:40.000 --> 3:49:43.840]  before this ever happened now the globalists have covered
[3:49:43.840 --> 3:49:47.200]  oh it's not our fault it's the other guy
[3:49:47.200 --> 3:49:50.880]  you know it's a virus it's something you can't even touch
[3:49:50.880 --> 3:49:55.520]  and they're squirting the fire hose of money at it to the tune of 68 000 per
[3:49:55.520 --> 3:50:01.440]  family of four in the in the u.s alone at the federal level alone
[3:50:01.440 --> 3:50:04.960]  forget what states might be doing to add on to that
[3:50:04.960 --> 3:50:08.240]  or other countries are doing to add on to that globally
[3:50:08.240 --> 3:50:12.640]  what a fire hose of money and how does money
[3:50:12.640 --> 3:50:19.280]  solve the virus it doesn't it gives you a false sense of security again well
[3:50:19.280 --> 3:50:23.040]  things are being carved away on a wholesale basis like everything is
[3:50:23.040 --> 3:50:27.200]  stood still as everything is carved away don't let
[3:50:27.200 --> 3:50:30.240]  it happen stay vigilant pay attention to details
[3:50:30.240 --> 3:50:33.920]  and watch your peripheral vision what's going on on the sidelines
[3:50:33.920 --> 3:50:37.040]  because a lot's going on on the sidelines
[3:50:37.040 --> 3:50:41.280]  that's being ignored we need to pay attention watch for that
[3:50:41.280 --> 3:50:44.880]  second and third wave of nonsense because it will come
[3:50:44.880 --> 3:50:47.840]  I don't know where I don't know what but it will come
[3:50:47.840 --> 3:50:52.560]  so we have to be calm in the midst of the storm I want to talk to a little bit
[3:50:52.560 --> 3:50:57.040]  about this from a historical perspective how we're reacting in Alaska
[3:50:57.040 --> 3:51:00.800]  you know Alaska during the Spanish flu a lot of people don't know this
[3:51:00.800 --> 3:51:05.120]  we were the second most devastated population
[3:51:05.120 --> 3:51:09.440]  in the world outside of Samoa people don't remember this
[3:51:09.440 --> 3:51:13.600]  more people died in Alaska per capita than anywhere else
[3:51:13.600 --> 3:51:17.440]  in the world over a hundred years ago one of the tribal governments that I
[3:51:17.440 --> 3:51:21.280]  worked with when I was involved in that work
[3:51:21.280 --> 3:51:25.600]  heavily in about 20 years ago more or less 20 years ago
[3:51:25.600 --> 3:51:29.120]  and I work with two groups I work with Chiklun Village and I work
[3:51:29.120 --> 3:51:32.720]  with Pionic the native village of Pionic and I work
[3:51:32.720 --> 3:51:36.800]  with the native village of Pionic's corporate entity
[3:51:36.800 --> 3:51:41.680]  Pionic native corporation also now what happened here in Alaska is chief
[3:51:41.680 --> 3:51:46.160]  Chiklusion during the Spanish flu went all around this region of Cook
[3:51:46.160 --> 3:51:50.080]  Inlet from the eight tribes that were here and collected all the orphan
[3:51:50.080 --> 3:51:53.920]  children because so many parents had died in my village of Chiklun
[3:51:53.920 --> 3:52:01.040]  850 citizens they guess were existed then it was reduced to five sisters
[3:52:01.040 --> 3:52:04.880]  and that rebuilt our village was those five sisters this happened all over
[3:52:04.880 --> 3:52:08.000]  Alaska so all these orphans went to Pionic
[3:52:08.000 --> 3:52:11.200]  and the and chief Chiklusion made sure they were taken care of
[3:52:11.200 --> 3:52:14.960]  and no one was allowed particularly white people because they were the ones
[3:52:14.960 --> 3:52:18.720]  they thought carried this and they actually were at the time
[3:52:18.720 --> 3:52:23.040]  and so Pionic self-segregated not just along
[3:52:23.040 --> 3:52:27.280]  ethnic lines racial lines because they felt the need to because
[3:52:27.280 --> 3:52:30.080]  clashing of culture hadn't served them very well
[3:52:30.080 --> 3:52:34.320]  in the early 1900s and delivered syphilis alcoholism smallpox and
[3:52:34.320 --> 3:52:36.720]  diseases and this was the last in the chain of
[3:52:36.720 --> 3:52:39.440]  events that they really didn't want to deal with and I don't blame them
[3:52:39.440 --> 3:52:45.600]  so they isolated I was one of the very few occasioned people
[3:52:45.600 --> 3:52:50.560]  for a long time invited in to help because a lot of us had screwed things up
[3:52:50.560 --> 3:52:54.400]  and I consider it one of the greatest honors in my life to be asked
[3:52:54.400 --> 3:52:57.520]  to come in to Pionic and Chiklun and work with
[3:52:57.520 --> 3:53:01.680]  with people I respect highly because of who they are what they are in their
[3:53:01.680 --> 3:53:05.920]  tenacity and what they know you know and
[3:53:05.920 --> 3:53:11.040]  here's what I know more than anything about the native cultures that I work
[3:53:11.040 --> 3:53:15.920]  with they are a family like you have never seen
[3:53:15.920 --> 3:53:19.920]  they embrace each other in a way the nation used to embrace each other
[3:53:19.920 --> 3:53:23.200]  they still do that's why I always like tribal governments
[3:53:23.200 --> 3:53:26.400]  you know it's kind of the place I interfaced in government the most was
[3:53:26.400 --> 3:53:29.520]  with with tribal peoples but that's the Spanish flu in
[3:53:29.520 --> 3:53:33.520]  Alaska you know so Alaskan villages whose elders still
[3:53:33.520 --> 3:53:37.200]  remember hearing their parents talking about it have shut down a lot of our
[3:53:37.200 --> 3:53:40.160]  rural villages which aren't hooked on to the road system
[3:53:40.160 --> 3:53:44.240]  some people a little worried about that they've set up 30-day
[3:53:44.240 --> 3:53:46.880]  quarantines anyone leaving they're not coming back
[3:53:46.880 --> 3:53:50.160]  unless they're quarantined 30 days not two weeks because they're
[3:53:50.160 --> 3:53:54.160]  they're worried they've seen it before now how bad is there are certain
[3:53:54.160 --> 3:53:58.320]  populations that are exposed that are going to be hit very severely and we've
[3:53:58.320 --> 3:54:01.840]  seen that the economic picture has already rolled
[3:54:01.840 --> 3:54:05.760]  out I've been talking about that for over a month now
[3:54:05.760 --> 3:54:10.000]  the borders were not secured this thing has been in the country since
[3:54:10.000 --> 3:54:14.240]  probably November first cases were back in October in China
[3:54:14.240 --> 3:54:18.720]  I came through the borders coming from Hong Kong to the US
[3:54:18.720 --> 3:54:22.800]  the 8th of February there was no questions and no checks on the US side
[3:54:22.800 --> 3:54:26.320]  friends that came in on that same route into Seattle from Hong Kong
[3:54:26.320 --> 3:54:30.480]  on the 29th of February just a few weeks ago
[3:54:30.480 --> 3:54:33.200]  no questions no no temperature checks nothing
[3:54:33.200 --> 3:54:37.280]  but that was happening in the third world as early as January
[3:54:37.280 --> 3:54:41.680]  so we didn't do anything now why is that the bureaucracy
[3:54:41.680 --> 3:54:46.080]  not the president the bureaucracy should have already been moving
[3:54:46.080 --> 3:54:50.400]  it didn't require presidential action to do what you're required to do if you're
[3:54:50.400 --> 3:54:54.240]  a federal employee within these agencies
[3:54:54.240 --> 3:54:57.920]  you need to move forward and they and I think they drug their feet a little bit
[3:54:57.920 --> 3:55:01.760]  that's too bad but we are where we are now here's the
[3:55:01.760 --> 3:55:05.200]  thing about lockdowns across the world they're going to lock them down at
[3:55:05.200 --> 3:55:08.640]  different times we're going to open them up at different times and guess what
[3:55:08.640 --> 3:55:13.120]  all of all of this whatever it is is going to rebland again
[3:55:13.120 --> 3:55:17.920]  and so it's not over the economic impacts are going to be here for a while
[3:55:17.920 --> 3:55:20.960]  it will probably get worse because of the propaganda
[3:55:20.960 --> 3:55:25.600]  but we need to hold our calm be the center of the storm
[3:55:25.600 --> 3:55:29.040]  be the quiet spot in the center of the storm
[3:55:29.040 --> 3:55:34.320]  but be loud enough to be heard be strong enough to be the leader when people
[3:55:34.320 --> 3:55:38.080]  are screaming for leadership be that leader rise out of the place that you
[3:55:38.080 --> 3:55:41.040]  are and be the calm voice of leadership at a time
[3:55:41.040 --> 3:55:44.960]  when it's needed and then think of the practical ways to deal with it
[3:55:44.960 --> 3:55:48.480]  because it's here with us whether we like it or not
[3:55:48.480 --> 3:55:53.840]  whether it's the virus of the plague of the of the Spanish flu at that
[3:55:53.840 --> 3:55:58.240]  magnitude we will not know for some time what we do know is how people are
[3:55:58.240 --> 3:56:03.200]  reacting to it has already created so many consequences that cannot be easily
[3:56:03.200 --> 3:56:08.080]  put back together now what is important is to retain
[3:56:08.080 --> 3:56:11.520]  the things that are fundamental to freedom and liberty
[3:56:11.520 --> 3:56:16.320]  to not allow another patriot act kind of suppression of who we are
[3:56:16.320 --> 3:56:20.240]  we need to roll it back the other way and we'll only do it with that calm voice
[3:56:20.240 --> 3:56:24.960]  they're already pre-setting up the public for chaos
[3:56:24.960 --> 3:56:28.000]  let's not be part of the chaos let's be part of the calm
[3:56:28.000 --> 3:56:31.840]  and be ready be prepared for whatever comes our way
[3:56:31.840 --> 3:56:36.720]  I believe in America I believe in Americans because that is America
[3:56:36.720 --> 3:56:40.160]  it's not the government has some abstract thing
[3:56:40.160 --> 3:56:44.320]  detached from us we are that and the government
[3:56:44.320 --> 3:56:48.160]  that fears his population is the government
[3:56:48.160 --> 3:56:52.640]  that is respectful and the population that fears its government
[3:56:52.640 --> 3:56:58.400]  has lost its dignity lost itself respect and lost who we are as individuals
[3:56:58.400 --> 3:57:03.040]  we're not some squishy collective lost in the world of chaos
[3:57:03.040 --> 3:57:07.760]  we're the light in the world if we remember who we are as created
[3:57:07.760 --> 3:57:11.680]  human beings created in the image and likeness of god I say it every week
[3:57:11.680 --> 3:57:16.080]  because I mean it I believe it and from that flows respect from that
[3:57:16.080 --> 3:57:20.800]  flows the power of solution of creativity of a combat without
[3:57:20.800 --> 3:57:24.160]  engagement in the way that has been done before
[3:57:24.160 --> 3:57:28.560]  engage with the force of who we are of the force of what we are and what we're
[3:57:28.560 --> 3:57:32.560]  created to be change the world one breath at a time one step at a time by
[3:57:32.560 --> 3:57:36.800]  doing what we believe is right and true that's how the world changed this is
[3:57:36.800 --> 3:57:47.760]  the end for war
