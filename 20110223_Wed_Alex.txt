[01:05.880 --> 01:09.080]  first part of the interview yesterday was too powerful record listening
[01:09.080 --> 01:14.040]  audience just on the audio streams as a gauge the audience wants more from
[01:14.040 --> 01:17.080]  Lindsay Williams he'll be joining us again with more information he couldn't
[01:17.080 --> 01:21.260]  even get to it all in the third hour today that we go into overdrive with
[01:21.260 --> 01:25.560]  James Corbett joining us from Japan with the Corbett report so that is what's
[01:25.560 --> 01:30.640]  coming up today I do have a special announcement that I'll make later in the
[01:30.640 --> 01:34.680]  next hour about a special guest that is on the broadcast tomorrow that'll
[01:34.680 --> 01:40.000]  definitely make big headlines around the world and it takes a lot to get me
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.600]  having butterflies but we're pretty excited about it set the record straight
[01:45.600 --> 01:51.320]  on some things but also the amount of attention that it will also you help
[01:51.320 --> 01:55.880]  folks find information about the new world order and the overall awakening
[01:55.880 --> 01:58.760]  that's happening I'll just leave it at that until later in the next hour and
[01:58.760 --> 02:05.360]  I'm going to announce that here on air for you today the globalist plan to
[02:05.360 --> 02:09.720]  destabilize the Middle East the powder keg of the suppressed people and the
[02:09.720 --> 02:15.000]  dictators installed by the globalist to keep them in line is continuing to
[02:15.000 --> 02:20.480]  explode and each cascading explosion or detonation of political anger and
[02:20.480 --> 02:25.760]  citizen rage is intensifying in a domino effect obviously we're going to be
[02:25.760 --> 02:30.200]  talking about that commodities continuing to explode in prices Italy says a
[02:30.200 --> 02:37.160]  thousand people were killed in protest in Libya and Libya has more contacts than
[02:37.160 --> 02:47.080]  just about anybody in the region because they're so close to Libya so that is just
[02:47.080 --> 02:53.000]  some of what is going to be coming up here on the broadcast also some news has
[02:53.000 --> 02:57.000]  come out in the last few months that we've mentioned but that I haven't given
[02:57.000 --> 03:05.360]  a proper amount of time to and that deals with the true frontier of how the
[03:05.360 --> 03:11.040]  globalist are going to suppress the population and so much of what we cover
[03:11.040 --> 03:16.080]  here has already been reported here but still is hiding in plain view even for
[03:16.080 --> 03:22.800]  myself when guests like dr. Nick baggage say Alex forget chemicals in the water
[03:22.800 --> 03:28.960]  forget vaccines that target the brain and reengineer the chemistry sure that's
[03:28.960 --> 03:33.160]  important and that's on the forefront of the globalist suppression of human
[03:33.160 --> 03:38.800]  intellect and consciousness but he said it's electromagnetic is where most their
[03:38.800 --> 03:42.960]  funding is and that's what dr. Nick baggage of course his brother us senator
[03:42.960 --> 03:49.240]  his father famous congressman great researcher incredible intellect in his
[03:49.240 --> 03:55.040]  own right just a month ago sober go he said listen it's all about frequencies
[03:55.040 --> 04:00.320]  it's all about DARPA's moves to test and this was even the Baltimore Sun about
[04:00.320 --> 04:03.920]  eight nine years ago I covered it on air at nauseam they said oh yeah we're
[04:03.920 --> 04:08.680]  testing putting towers up in cities to calm you during civil unrest and and
[04:08.680 --> 04:13.040]  they admittedly have a whole bunch of different frequencies and wavelengths
[04:13.040 --> 04:20.720]  and things that literally can make you die make you become sick make you become
[04:20.720 --> 04:25.800]  happy make you hallucinate but now this is starting to come out in the mainstream
[04:25.800 --> 04:31.720]  news see they're rolling it out like oh isn't it fun you're not gonna be upset

[05:04.360 --> 05:07.680]  the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions
[05:07.680 --> 05:11.480]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and
[05:11.480 --> 05:15.240]  how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the
[05:15.240 --> 05:19.680]  body my name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the silver lungs
[05:19.680 --> 05:24.000]  generator not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and
[05:24.000 --> 05:28.360]  ionic silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and
[05:28.360 --> 05:33.240]  devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas
[05:33.240 --> 05:40.440]  this includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and orally for the
[05:40.440 --> 05:44.600]  digestive system be sure to watch our new seven minute video tour of the silver
[05:44.600 --> 05:50.880]  lung system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the silver lung

[06:02.160 --> 06:06.040]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[06:06.040 --> 06:09.800]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[06:09.800 --> 06:13.760]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[06:13.760 --> 06:18.120]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[06:18.120 --> 06:22.560]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[06:22.560 --> 06:27.320]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[06:27.320 --> 06:31.120]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[06:31.120 --> 06:34.720]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[06:34.720 --> 06:38.840]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[06:38.840 --> 06:42.240]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[06:42.240 --> 06:46.080]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my old sponsors you can

[08:00.440 --> 08:08.880]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:21.640 --> 08:27.120]  we're live locked and loaded ready to go thank you so much for joining us it is
[08:27.120 --> 08:34.440]  Wednesday the 23rd day of February 2011 incredible interview with Lindsey
[08:34.440 --> 08:38.800]  Williams yesterday we're doing part two of that live with even more revelations
[08:38.800 --> 08:42.720]  about the globalist have orchestrated the collapse in the Middle East to then
[08:42.720 --> 08:48.400]  break their deal with the Arabs to not develop the massive oil reserves in
[08:48.400 --> 08:52.600]  North America they had a deal set up in the 70s where they would not allow
[08:52.600 --> 08:59.360]  massive development of oil on public lands in Alaska in Colorado in Utah and
[08:59.360 --> 09:04.520]  in many other areas Texas is a state that rebelled and didn't go along with
[09:04.520 --> 09:07.520]  it that's why it's one of the few states that continued to develop its reserves
[09:07.520 --> 09:12.200]  that are nothing compared to Alaska and that's the double cross of the Arabs but
[09:12.200 --> 09:15.840]  then that leads to the death of the dollar by the end of 2012 from his
[09:15.840 --> 09:19.960]  inside sources known to us by the way one of them Ken Fromm died in December the
[09:19.960 --> 09:25.000]  other even more high-powered we just calling Mr. L former CEO of a major
[09:25.000 --> 09:29.080]  oil company he'll be joining us to discuss that more and take your phone
[09:29.080 --> 09:33.760]  calls in the third hour Porter Stansbury on the death of the dollar he was on
[09:33.760 --> 09:36.440]  with us a few months ago he predicted so much of now what is beginning to
[09:36.440 --> 09:39.800]  accelerate and unfold there's reasons that we're seeing riots all over the
[09:39.800 --> 09:45.000]  world now and demonstrations in the West is because the standard of living is
[09:45.000 --> 09:49.520]  plunging right now the media saying oh it's a boom time the economy's great
[09:49.520 --> 09:52.920]  the session ended almost two years ago everything's wonderful everything's
[09:52.920 --> 09:57.920]  wonderful but you're you're seeing the what they've tried to paper over
[09:57.920 --> 10:05.280]  basically coming out you know from behind the edges so it's gonna get more
[10:05.280 --> 10:10.840]  and more crazy we're gonna be breaking that down also I had a caller on Monday
[10:10.840 --> 10:23.520]  who said Alex I read in a report I really need to take this call stuff is
[10:23.520 --> 10:26.440]  getting so crazy and so busy I'm just not gonna take it even though it's super
[10:26.440 --> 10:32.520]  important hey can I call you back during the break okay I'll call you back in 10
[10:32.520 --> 10:40.360]  thanks can't ignore that phone call it deals with the show sorry doing some
[10:40.360 --> 10:50.960]  producer work myself so I have to deal with that um we had a caller who was
[10:50.960 --> 10:58.000]  saying that he had read somewhere but didn't see any bibliographed linkage
[10:58.000 --> 11:02.800]  that the US government is training with foreign governments to occupy the US
[11:02.800 --> 11:09.360]  with foreign trips and I just off the top my head said well if you watch my film
[11:09.360 --> 11:14.440]  road to tyranny we have the Associated Press and Toronto Star and other news
[11:14.440 --> 11:20.480]  articles on the screen where in 2002 they signed agreements to use Mexican and
[11:20.480 --> 11:26.560]  Canadian troops in the United States for quote civil unrest and terrorism to
[11:26.560 --> 11:33.120]  fight foreign domestic terrorist and for civil uprisings that's in the NLE09
[11:33.120 --> 11:36.160]  drill just put an NLE09 the first link you get
[11:36.160 --> 11:40.480]  let's just put it on screen for folks watching on prisonplanet.tv is FEMA
[11:40.480 --> 11:43.400]  putting a press release out how they were working with all these foreign
[11:43.400 --> 11:46.840]  governments to track and suppress terrorists during an uprising in the
[11:46.840 --> 11:55.600]  US then of course there's the quotes by different generals that we've played on
[11:55.600 --> 12:02.640]  the air what Wesley Clark's one of them also Colonel Craig Roberts nephew going
[12:02.640 --> 12:07.760]  on a West Point was given an internal briefing with several hundred of the cadets
[12:07.760 --> 12:12.400]  and then after Roberts has told the story many times then later he was given
[12:12.400 --> 12:19.080]  another briefing once he was out of out of the training and in the official
[12:19.080 --> 12:23.440]  military that yes foreign assets would be used during uprisings in the United
[12:23.440 --> 12:30.400]  States because corrupt systems always try to use outside forces because even if
[12:30.400 --> 12:35.920]  you can get 30 40 50% of your troops to fire on their own citizens or even if you
[12:35.920 --> 12:40.240]  fly New Yorkers down to Texas or Texans up to Wisconsin you know a lot of times
[12:40.240 --> 12:46.000]  countries will try to we saw this during the uprising in Tiananmen Square it took
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.800]  them about a day and a half to respond because they shipped in troops from
[12:48.800 --> 12:52.760]  several what was it 400 500 miles away from a totally different province where
[12:52.760 --> 12:56.680]  they even spoke a different Chinese dialect to make sure they weren't
[12:56.680 --> 13:04.840]  shooting mommy and daddy and brother and sis and their cousin and so I
[13:04.840 --> 13:09.120]  really should do some more research on this or we go over research to
[13:09.120 --> 13:13.880]  recodify it and do a special report on it and I said last week I do a special
[13:13.880 --> 13:17.440]  report this week on the fact that we've been completely vindicated by
[13:17.440 --> 13:21.960]  governmental and private reports dealing with the anthrax attacks being an
[13:21.960 --> 13:26.080]  inside job that was just in the Washington Post last week I mean there's so
[13:26.080 --> 13:31.720]  much evidence I can't even get over all the information that we have here and I
[13:31.720 --> 13:35.840]  can't even go over all of it myself it's just pouring in but looking at news
[13:35.840 --> 13:46.080]  this morning that the crew printed off for me I noticed a Canada comm news
[13:46.080 --> 13:50.200]  report and in fact this didn't print the whole story you guys print me the rest
[13:50.200 --> 13:56.360]  thank you and this is out of the Ottawa citizen one of the biggest national
[13:56.360 --> 14:02.640]  papers it's the paper there in the capital city of Ottawa in Canada and
[14:02.640 --> 14:08.320]  here's the headline Canada US agree to use each other's troops in several
[14:08.320 --> 14:18.760]  emergencies and I mentioned Monday that during the Olympics last year US troops
[14:18.760 --> 14:23.000]  were in the major cities where the Olympics were taking place in Canada
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.800]  and that was all over the news and US troops and Canadian troops were
[14:26.800 --> 14:31.120]  patrolling the bar districts so they use special events to acclimate you to
[14:31.120 --> 14:35.120]  this like having troops in the Kentucky Derby or troops at the Super Bowl and
[14:35.120 --> 14:37.160]  then they just start rolling them out everywhere but there's the Ottawa
[14:37.160 --> 14:42.760]  citizen Canada US agree to use each other's troops in several emergencies
[14:42.760 --> 14:47.040]  Canada and the US have signed an agreement by the way they signed it eight
[14:47.040 --> 14:51.960]  years ago this is an expansion that paves the way for the militaries from each
[14:51.960 --> 14:55.200]  other's nations to send troops across each other's borders during an
[14:55.200 --> 14:58.960]  emergency but some are questioning why the Harper government has kept silent
[14:58.960 --> 15:04.360]  on the deal well eight years ago when it was announced in the AP in the
[15:04.360 --> 15:10.040]  Washington Post in Toronto Star as well it was in the Mexican newspapers because
[15:10.040 --> 15:13.880]  they're not just going to use Mexican and Canadian troops here they're going to
[15:13.880 --> 15:17.400]  use them in Canada and Mexico it's all vice versa each other's armies inside
[15:17.400 --> 15:21.880]  each other's countries and under the agreement it was a North American Union
[15:21.880 --> 15:27.040]  agreement for North American security perimeter 2002 then it was signed under
[15:27.040 --> 15:32.120]  executive treaty which is unconstitutional Congress didn't ratify it by
[15:32.120 --> 15:41.760]  George W. Bush of a Sente Fox and who was the Prime Minister of Canada at the
[15:41.760 --> 15:46.800]  time it'll pop my head in a minute the point is they signed it at Baylor about
[15:46.800 --> 15:51.960]  90 miles north of me up here in Waco and then the treaty was secret I mean it was
[15:51.960 --> 15:55.600]  on record secret treaty and there was almost no news coverage of it but then
[15:55.600 --> 16:00.880]  judicial watch and others sued and were able to get not the treaty but the SPP
[16:00.880 --> 16:06.600]  meeting from 2006 at Banff Canada where they were reading over sections of the
[16:06.600 --> 16:11.320]  treaty so we got most of it from the minutes and at that Banff Canada meeting
[16:11.320 --> 16:16.600]  you had over 500 CEOs from Europe and North America and Asia and they ratified
[16:16.600 --> 16:22.560]  the plan for the SPP the ongoing plan and then ordered the heads of the
[16:22.560 --> 16:26.440]  different state departments of the countries to to to execute it and I
[16:26.440 --> 16:30.120]  mean in the thousands of pages judicial watch got and posted on their site and
[16:30.120 --> 16:33.640]  we boil it down and cover it in the endgame and there's a bibliography of
[16:33.640 --> 16:36.960]  it and what is the endgame.com everything in the film has bibliography
[16:36.960 --> 16:42.960]  online we check every minute of the film has links and documents and that's why
[16:42.960 --> 16:47.400]  I'm always freaking out this is so big this is so out in the open now and it
[16:47.400 --> 16:50.480]  said we're gonna call it a North American security perimeter but we've got
[16:50.480 --> 16:57.360]  to integrate our nations by stealth because this is very unpopular politically
[16:57.360 --> 17:04.360]  and in there they said they would use the threat of terrorism natural disaster
[17:04.360 --> 17:17.320]  the flu other biological problems they said that they would use that as a way
[17:17.320 --> 17:22.040]  to sell the public in the future on accepting having each other's militaries
[17:22.040 --> 17:28.320]  in each other's countries and we're all that daily covered it judicial watch
[17:28.320 --> 17:32.000]  covered it we covered it Costa Costa and covered a few others did but really
[17:32.000 --> 17:36.440]  nobody else but the point I'm making to the caller for Monday as he said on the
[17:36.440 --> 17:39.920]  spot give me documentation I gave him from memory a lot of places where he
[17:39.920 --> 17:44.640]  could get it but I mean here's February 22nd yesterday I got it this morning
[17:44.640 --> 17:49.160]  without even looking I mean I see this stuff every month or so sometimes more
[17:49.160 --> 17:54.960]  often where they admit that it is to suppress insurrection I mean go read it
[17:54.960 --> 18:01.920]  it's the National Paper of Canada one of the major national papers of Canada
[18:01.920 --> 18:08.600]  the Ottawa citizen and there it is I mean just last year I sent some of the
[18:08.600 --> 18:14.280]  crew Rob do and others up to Chicago and they did drills of putting Americans
[18:14.280 --> 18:19.520]  in sports stadiums arresting people and they had Polish troops Czech Republic
[18:19.520 --> 18:24.040]  troops and they were training to go back and suppress their population and our
[18:24.040 --> 18:27.800]  military was training to suppress our population here and it was admitted that
[18:27.800 --> 18:31.480]  that's what it was for and then they had an unannounced drill the day my guys had
[18:31.480 --> 18:35.320]  to fly out but they it did come out the news that they had another drill at the
[18:35.320 --> 18:38.880]  big football stadium in Chicago for locking people down and rounding them
[18:38.880 --> 18:45.080]  up and then I showed you some ran corporation documents two weeks ago on
[18:45.080 --> 18:52.760]  air and and federal government articles for the army and FEMA dealing with
[18:52.760 --> 18:56.920]  sports stadiums and how to put people in them and lock things down I mean see
[18:56.920 --> 19:00.120]  that's what's so frustrating about Glenn Beck and people saying oh I'm gonna
[19:00.120 --> 19:04.120]  expose the FEMA camps oh they're real and hyping it for a month and coming out
[19:04.120 --> 19:07.520]  and saying they're not real and using strawman examples of camps that aren't
[19:07.520 --> 19:12.520]  camps and I even predicted he'd do that I mean I just it's frustrating to pour
[19:12.520 --> 19:16.280]  over this 24 hours a day I mean I was dreaming about all this last night I
[19:16.280 --> 19:20.120]  don't even get rest when I'm sleeping and then to see people knowingly up
[19:20.120 --> 19:24.520]  there posing as patriots deceiving you and it makes me very very angry I would
[19:24.520 --> 19:28.920]  love to fall down on my knees and lick Glenn Beck's boots if he would just tell
[19:28.920 --> 19:34.280]  the truth just like I do Ron Paul I mean I want there to be leaders who are real
[19:34.280 --> 19:38.820]  I want I don't want us it's not you notice I don't attack other talk show
[19:38.820 --> 19:41.400]  house very often I like to praise people and they go in the right direction
[19:41.400 --> 19:46.360]  when Limbaugh or Savage do and I try to praise Beck when he goes in the right
[19:46.360 --> 19:50.160]  direction he just consciously mixes deception and that's what's dangerous but
[19:50.160 --> 19:54.360]  here it is we want to know about foreign trips for America and vice versa for
[19:54.360 --> 20:00.760]  Canada and Mexico there it is big paper in Canada new article out yesterday the

[23:59.280 --> 24:13.560]  well enough the kind of kissing by the way I'm seen with fairer I've never in
[24:13.560 --> 24:21.680]  Seattle in other cities restaurantiers and coffee shop owners are
[24:21.680 --> 24:29.040]  refusing to serve TSA agents these are restaurants and things outside airports
[24:29.040 --> 24:35.240]  nearby and in one case the owner of the of the restaurant coffee shop said
[24:35.240 --> 24:39.560]  they've humiliated me that you know they've basically grabbed me they treat
[24:39.560 --> 24:47.800]  you know they've yelled at me and I am not going to put up with it and so they
[24:47.800 --> 24:51.960]  turn their backs on the TSA workers who faces they recognize or when they come
[24:51.960 --> 24:55.960]  in in uniform and they do not serve them and shunning is a powerful way to
[24:55.960 --> 25:00.640]  protest by the way I said I get into Donald Rumsfeld in the big 9-11
[25:00.640 --> 25:04.360]  development and we'll cover that in the next segment because I was waiting to
[25:04.360 --> 25:09.120]  confirm that Eric Muller man cowl could come on incredible interview he did a
[25:09.120 --> 25:13.760]  few days ago where Rumsfeld said he doesn't know about building seven has
[25:13.760 --> 25:18.760]  never heard of it which of course is a ball-faced line was a giant CIA command
[25:18.760 --> 25:24.120]  base FBI base NSA base defense intelligence base almost the entire
[25:24.120 --> 25:27.720]  building every floor but a few was government black ops that's on record
[25:27.720 --> 25:31.960]  the state command center the federal command center for a three-state area
[25:31.960 --> 25:37.960]  was in there Giuliani's bunker they done the big renovation a year before to
[25:37.960 --> 25:43.280]  harden it against attack they did some special modifications but man cowl
[25:43.280 --> 25:46.840]  starting to wake up to 9-11 now he's with his family right now with his kids
[25:46.840 --> 25:49.520]  he's trying to duck out of a restaurant talk to us for 10 minutes
[25:49.520 --> 25:55.760]  that's coming up the next segment but the exciting development is that the
[25:55.760 --> 26:00.560]  TSA is a globalist move to acclimate us to condition us for prisoner slave
[26:00.560 --> 26:05.600]  training but it's a perfect issue to get the people together because it isn't
[26:05.600 --> 26:09.440]  about liberal or conservative how they always divide us it's about we're
[26:09.440 --> 26:13.480]  human beings with dignity and what you're doing is wrong and it's not keeping
[26:13.480 --> 26:16.800]  us safe and we don't want to be microwaved by the scanners I went and got
[26:16.800 --> 26:22.080]  my hair cut yesterday and the lady who cut my hair her boyfriend was flying
[26:22.080 --> 26:26.280]  back from North Carolina and the scanners were still in place there a lot
[26:26.280 --> 26:29.640]  of the airports they've turned them off or barely use them and they put him
[26:29.640 --> 26:32.800]  through the scanner hands up they were doing pat downs of everybody else who'd
[26:32.800 --> 26:35.960]  already gone through the scanners see it's not just refuse the scanner get a
[26:35.960 --> 26:42.000]  pat down they're phasing in both to train you to be humiliated to train the
[26:42.000 --> 26:45.760]  TSA workers to then hit the streets and have checkpoints that's already being
[26:45.760 --> 26:49.360]  rolled out this is about training everybody government media the public
[26:49.360 --> 26:55.720]  the courts they don't even follow the radiation laws of OSHA with radiology
[26:55.720 --> 27:00.400]  they just do whatever they want you know a dental office emergency room they've
[27:00.400 --> 27:03.600]  got to have weekly and monthly checks and calibrations of their equipment and
[27:03.600 --> 27:07.200]  private firms coming in and testing it not the TSA they just do whatever we
[27:07.200 --> 27:13.560]  want no radiation badges know nothing but there she was and she's not a
[27:13.560 --> 27:19.560]  listener of the show there she was out of the blue not even she knows who I am
[27:19.560 --> 27:21.960]  as people come over and shook my hand you know every time I'm there getting my
[27:21.960 --> 27:26.360]  haircut but she's like yeah you you talk about TSA I heard well this happened
[27:26.360 --> 27:30.920]  to my boyfriend and she was telling me how angry she was and how she might not
[27:30.920 --> 27:36.160]  fly anymore and how this was wrong and how it's humiliation and she totally
[27:36.160 --> 27:41.280]  got it so I told her spread the word say no so this is a fight they're gonna lose
[27:41.280 --> 27:44.720]  we've we've got right on our side if we stand up and continue to expose what
[27:44.720 --> 27:50.080]  they're doing they're gonna fail but to have restaurant tours in fact and and
[27:50.080 --> 27:53.320]  other business owners just Watson reported one story I did a search and
[27:53.320 --> 27:57.480]  found several others this is a trend and this is getting picked up by other
[27:57.480 --> 28:04.000]  people so I want to invite folks to go to prisonplanet.com let me pull the
[28:04.000 --> 28:11.840]  article up so I give you the exact headline here I know he wrote that this
[28:11.840 --> 28:15.920]  morning has it already rolled off a featured news man they post so much
[28:15.920 --> 28:20.280]  stuff and info wars and prison planet even our original news that's bombshell
[28:20.280 --> 28:23.800]  that it scrolls off in a few hours I guess you got to check the featured news
[28:23.800 --> 28:29.520]  archive that's the link there here it is it's still on info wars.com and the
[28:29.520 --> 28:36.200]  featured news second story Seattle businesses refused to serve TSA agents
[28:36.200 --> 28:40.440]  so I guess he does have the multiple businesses there in Seattle but this is
[28:40.440 --> 28:45.280]  spreading all over the place and so we're not gonna associate with you we're
[28:45.280 --> 28:50.000]  not gonna talk to you unless it's coming over and if you're a congressperson
[28:50.000 --> 28:53.120]  letting this happen or you're a government bureaucrat letting this
[28:53.120 --> 28:58.040]  happen or you're a TSA minion you're all guilty and if you're TSA people you
[28:58.040 --> 29:01.880]  should say no to this you know you should unionize that's what's dangerous
[29:01.880 --> 29:06.560]  about not having unions I know unions can have a bad side but they also have a
[29:06.560 --> 29:09.520]  very good side of the citizen we're getting organized the problem is the
[29:09.520 --> 29:13.720]  globalists have taken over all the unions and basically render them impotent
[29:13.720 --> 29:22.520]  and servile but I know for a fact they're culling through the TSA workers and
[29:22.520 --> 29:26.000]  go do you have a problem with the radiation yes you're fired you have a
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.920]  problem sticking your hands down people's pants yes you're fired and then
[29:28.920 --> 29:32.280]  they that's why you have so many problems with them stealing and abusing
[29:32.280 --> 29:36.200]  and robbing and going crazy and yelling at people oh that was the rest of the
[29:36.200 --> 29:40.280]  story he goes through the checkpoint then he's done he puts his hands in his
[29:40.280 --> 29:44.960]  pockets waiting they scream and yell at him like he's a prisoner scan him again
[29:44.960 --> 29:50.080]  pat him down again yelling at him how dare you put your hands in your pants
[29:50.080 --> 29:59.400]  we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[33:46.160 --> 33:49.520]  pockets right now get him out get him a get over you got to go back through the
[33:49.520 --> 33:52.720]  scanner you're hiding something and they put him back through the scanner and
[33:52.720 --> 33:55.760]  then patting down and we're just being really mean to him like he was a
[33:55.760 --> 34:00.160]  prisoner on a bus who'd you know just been taken out of the county jail being
[34:00.160 --> 34:06.920]  sent to San Quentin or Huntsville and you're rolling up that's exactly how
[34:06.920 --> 34:11.200]  they treat you at a rough prison I mean from what I've read even low-security
[34:11.200 --> 34:14.800]  prisons they're not that rude or mean to you not even so much medium but high
[34:14.800 --> 34:20.400]  security you know they let you know they humiliate you they strip you down and in
[34:20.400 --> 34:24.040]  some cases TSA strips you down in public or takes you in a back room while they
[34:24.040 --> 34:28.320]  rob your suitcase of money I mean just every day multiple articles of them
[34:28.320 --> 34:34.360]  being caught stealing wedding rings cash jewelry electronics I mean it is just a
[34:34.360 --> 34:39.720]  orgy of theft that's going on and this is the public being trained how to be
[34:39.720 --> 34:43.440]  prisoners but they're not going to put up with it forever they're not going to
[34:43.440 --> 34:48.760]  break the will of the American people now we're only going to briefly have
[34:48.760 --> 34:52.760]  man cow on then I'm going to get into patent nervous system manipulation from
[34:52.760 --> 34:58.280]  television monitors and how that ties in to this other report that we covered
[34:58.280 --> 35:02.560]  a few months ago ceiling lights in Minnesota send code internet data but
[35:02.560 --> 35:06.720]  then we've got the patents on similar systems that flash at a level not
[35:06.720 --> 35:10.840]  perceptible by the eye but to the brain and can actually manipulate you with
[35:10.840 --> 35:14.840]  that I mean this is confirmed you know the old thing of how a hypnotist with a
[35:14.840 --> 35:18.680]  flashing light or the or the swinging watch this is much more high-tech than
[35:18.680 --> 35:22.000]  that and they can actually make you throw up they can do anything they want
[35:22.000 --> 35:27.200]  with this and now through data through power lines they can do it with the the
[35:27.200 --> 35:30.760]  fluorescent bulbs that's why they've unified these worldwide you notice
[35:30.760 --> 35:34.520]  worldwide it these are going in governments pass the laws to get in
[35:34.520 --> 35:39.080]  line with the UN agenda 21 and they're toxic if one breaks in your house you've
[35:39.080 --> 35:43.400]  got to evacuate it and open the windows and call a toxin control team poison
[35:43.400 --> 35:48.240]  control team nothing to do with the environment they're getting rid of
[35:48.240 --> 35:52.560]  phosphorescent because these are systems literally for mind control and it's
[35:52.560 --> 35:56.640]  hidden in plain view that's coming up but first here's the big news Donald
[35:56.640 --> 36:02.840]  Rumsfeld imagine this Donald Rumsfeld former secretary of defense out pushing
[36:02.840 --> 36:07.200]  his book went on man Cal Muller's syndicated broadcast it's on all over
[36:07.200 --> 36:11.680]  the country including W.A.B.C. in New York and I can listen to it out of
[36:11.680 --> 36:15.760]  Houston that's the closest city I can hear it big show he goes on there and
[36:15.760 --> 36:19.520]  he says hey what about building seven what about building seven we're gonna
[36:19.520 --> 36:23.120]  play that short clip first and Rumsfeld says never heard of it don't know
[36:23.120 --> 36:28.160]  anything about it now this was a CIA state federal command base with the army
[36:28.160 --> 36:32.440]  defense intelligence in it FBI the command center of that entire area the
[36:32.440 --> 36:36.200]  east coast they're running a drill of it being attacked that day that's why they
[36:36.200 --> 36:39.120]  moved the command centers out on the pier in the mobile command centers that's
[36:39.120 --> 36:42.760]  ABC News reporting that and Rumsfeld says he never heard of it he says building
[36:42.760 --> 36:46.720]  what that's why it's called the building what campaign the ads running in New
[36:46.720 --> 36:49.560]  York that have gotten herald a river to wake up and come out and say he
[36:49.560 --> 36:53.000]  questions building seven and judge Andrew Napolitano because they have honor
[36:53.000 --> 36:58.880]  especially Napolitano because last night I was picking up some Mexican food to
[36:58.880 --> 37:03.600]  bring home I do that quite often I have to add to my gut and I was walking out
[37:03.600 --> 37:09.880]  and a fellow walked over to me and said you know I'm a mainline conservative but
[37:09.880 --> 37:13.600]  you woke me up my dad didn't believe in 9-11 being an inside job but I showed
[37:13.600 --> 37:16.640]  him the footage of building seven and plotting and you know he was a Navy SEAL
[37:16.640 --> 37:22.040]  slash UDT his dad and he said that's a control demolition yeah they blew it I
[37:22.040 --> 37:25.720]  mean that's all you got to do is watch building seven so that's why I mean look
[37:25.720 --> 37:31.280]  at Jesse Ventura UDT Navy SEAL saying the same thing anybody who knows sees
[37:31.280 --> 37:34.920]  that but then we have all the footage of the saying get back we're gonna blow up
[37:34.920 --> 37:38.120]  seven we have the local newscast saying they're thinking about bringing the
[37:38.120 --> 37:42.560]  building down let's go ahead and play this 22nd clip and there's a longer one
[37:42.560 --> 37:46.640]  coming up with the former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld on Mancow's
[37:46.640 --> 37:51.560]  radio show the audio is also at mancow.com here it is building seven I
[37:51.560 --> 37:55.400]  often hear about no plane hit building seven why did building seven come down
[37:55.400 --> 37:59.720]  what do you tell people what is building seven or when it was a building five or
[37:59.720 --> 38:04.800]  the building that wasn't hit by the plane building seven I have no idea I've
[38:04.800 --> 38:13.080]  never heard that do a talk radio show oh you'll hear you'll hear it there's a
[38:13.080 --> 38:17.920]  longer clip coming up mancow do you really believe that a 47-story building
[38:17.920 --> 38:22.520]  it would be the biggest building in over 40 states several hundred yards away
[38:22.520 --> 38:27.200]  not hit by a falling building fire started and it collapses at 525 the
[38:27.200 --> 38:30.920]  afternoon seeing in the police are on tape saying get back they're gonna blow
[38:30.920 --> 38:34.080]  up that building I can play that clip if you want to hear it and Rumsfeld
[38:34.080 --> 38:38.960]  magically doesn't know about the main CIA building on the East Coast outside
[38:38.960 --> 38:44.760]  Lainley blowing up and collapsing that day at freefall speed
[38:44.760 --> 38:52.040]  oh my god Alex I'm walking through my kids what are you asking me you sent me
[38:52.040 --> 38:56.400]  the building seven clip yesterday yeah I was on your show today you brought it up
[38:56.400 --> 39:01.440]  to me you said this is really starting to make you question things well okay
[39:01.440 --> 39:07.640]  look here here's the deal I feel like the Jedi mind trick was telling me
[39:07.640 --> 39:11.200]  because I don't know what is like how could he not know I couldn't wrap my
[39:11.200 --> 39:14.800]  mind around it I just you don't even know how to respond it's kind of like you
[39:14.800 --> 39:19.000]  walk in with your wife and she's with another guy and you say honey what's
[39:19.000 --> 39:24.320]  going on Jesus well what guy there's no guy here but I can see the guy I mean it
[39:24.320 --> 39:28.360]  was just this over I mean look he was very friendly you saw the letterman he was
[39:28.360 --> 39:32.920]  very friendly letterman as well just a very friendly guy but how does he know
[39:32.920 --> 39:39.360]  building that came down it defies it defies everything doesn't it well you
[39:39.360 --> 39:43.040]  could hear how he suddenly because I've heard the rest of the interview you know
[39:43.040 --> 39:46.960]  he's a lot more energetic he just gets real quiet and goes no I don't I don't
[39:46.960 --> 39:52.880]  know anything about that I mean that's got lie written all over it well how does
[39:52.880 --> 39:59.000]  he not know building seven excuse me how does he not know building seven of
[39:59.000 --> 40:03.800]  you what do you what do you make of that well man cow they never want to talk
[40:03.800 --> 40:08.320]  about building seven they never paid any attention to it I've got scores and I've
[40:08.320 --> 40:11.920]  played them here over and over again we've written articles about it with CNN
[40:11.920 --> 40:17.880]  local CBS local Fox Amy Goodman was there and they're told to run it's gonna
[40:17.880 --> 40:21.320]  blow up and the cops are saying get back it's about to come down they're gonna
[40:21.320 --> 40:25.160]  bring down that building Silverstein goes on PBS a year later and says we gave
[40:25.160 --> 40:29.520]  the order to pull it and then watch the building come down well I've heard the
[40:29.520 --> 40:32.560]  stories it was it was a play in demolition right they were gonna bring it
[40:32.560 --> 40:38.000]  down now there I mean I've heard that and now they're claiming that another
[40:38.000 --> 40:41.920]  building fell on it although that's not really what happened is what you what do
[40:41.920 --> 40:46.200]  you say another say so so where are you heading with this are you saying that
[40:46.200 --> 40:52.480]  Grosold and Bush and both and then all these characters were you on it today they
[40:52.480 --> 40:56.480]  brought down all these buildings well you know I'm well we have to ask the
[40:56.480 --> 41:00.520]  question why are they acting stupid why is it on record that they said they were
[41:00.520 --> 41:07.160]  gonna blow it up BBC 25 minutes before on BBC World and BBC 24
[41:07.160 --> 41:11.680]  simultaneously with the same script with their teleprompter readers on two
[41:11.680 --> 41:16.080]  different BBC's said building seven the Solomon Brothers building has fallen
[41:16.080 --> 41:20.440]  it's completely collapsed and there they are live with it right behind them it
[41:20.440 --> 41:26.240]  hasn't collapsed and then they denied that they even did that then years later
[41:26.240 --> 41:30.480]  BBC said yes we were told by Reuters that it collapsed this is what's happening
[41:30.480 --> 41:35.000]  it's kind of like Lee Harvey Oswald two hours before his name was released about
[41:35.000 --> 41:39.120]  an hour before he was even captured running around Dallas they got their
[41:39.120 --> 41:43.000]  time zones wrong and in New Zealand Australia and several other countries
[41:43.000 --> 41:48.240]  newspapers ran with his photo in his name that he was the shooter of John F.
[41:48.240 --> 41:52.000]  Kennedy when it wasn't even on the news here yet they had their story and their
[41:52.000 --> 41:56.840]  script well ready and they and they jumped the gun they jump the gun well
[41:56.840 --> 42:03.880]  I've you know I've never heard that now but look from from different networks and
[42:03.880 --> 42:08.560]  watching how things are done I mean just and this is not gonna really help you
[42:08.560 --> 42:13.280]  with your show I just find it interesting that every time I'm with a crowd and I
[42:13.280 --> 42:22.120]  was at CPAC and you know Ron Paul won 30% I mean he won and then some other
[42:22.120 --> 42:25.320]  people were getting two and three percent and that's who we hear about on TV
[42:25.320 --> 42:31.720]  Ron Paul killed CPAC and all we hear about is Romney I've broken bread with
[42:31.720 --> 42:36.120]  Romney I've hung out with Romney he's a nice enough fella he's unelectable as
[42:36.120 --> 42:40.160]  president and if the Republicans their main thing seems to be against hell
[42:40.160 --> 42:45.960]  care oh blah blah care and yet that's what Romney gave us in Minnesota Romney
[42:45.960 --> 42:51.400]  wrote it run a Romney wrote it yeah so I look there's well there's a lot that is
[42:51.400 --> 42:58.240]  is very odd to me I I mean I see right it's like building seven I you know
[42:58.240 --> 43:01.920]  building seven came down no it didn't these aren't the droids you're looking
[43:01.920 --> 43:09.040]  for you know Ron Paul in every one of these polls wins and you and I are
[43:09.040 --> 43:13.680]  both friends with Ron Paul so maybe that that distorts our view I and I like him
[43:13.680 --> 43:18.160]  politically but it's just amazing Romney is a guaranteed loser and that's who
[43:18.160 --> 43:21.120]  they're gonna run and they keep telling us Romney Romney Romney reminds me of
[43:21.120 --> 43:25.880]  Giuliani never Giuliani remember Fred Thompson yeah they're putting a horse
[43:25.880 --> 43:30.400]  that can't win and it's like a Don King fight where he puts a fight around that
[43:30.400 --> 43:34.000]  couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag against Tyson but expanding on that
[43:34.000 --> 43:39.520]  analogy and now you got to go but I mean this is important man Cal expanding on
[43:39.520 --> 43:44.160]  that he only won by two points last year he won by seven points totally
[43:44.160 --> 43:50.920]  creaming Romney a second place and I was listening to the radio news feed that
[43:50.920 --> 43:57.760]  this network Genesis carries and they didn't even report the Monday after that
[43:57.760 --> 44:03.480]  Ron Paul had won all they talked about was Mitt Romney and so I just exactly I
[44:03.480 --> 44:08.760]  mean it's like the Super Bowl and you know a team wins and then they don't
[44:08.760 --> 44:11.680]  even tell you about the team that won the Super Bowl they tell you about the
[44:11.680 --> 44:17.800]  team that lost and imply that they won hey I mean it is the generals versus the
[44:17.800 --> 44:23.020]  globetrotters and yet they keep running the generals hey bud let me let me tell
[44:23.020 --> 44:29.120]  you here in Chicago what happened yesterday oh yeah let me stop you talk
[44:29.120 --> 44:34.520]  about it a magically record of voting problems and and the gangster Rahm
[44:34.520 --> 44:41.040]  Emmanuel he's in tell us now well look you have a it's so big Alex it's so big
[44:41.040 --> 44:45.600]  and I don't want to insult your listeners I but it's so big I don't
[44:45.600 --> 44:48.760]  even know how to put it in the radio terms and this is what I do for a living
[44:48.760 --> 44:53.080]  let me try to make it simple this guy Rod Blagojevich came out and said look
[44:53.080 --> 44:57.120]  they're there crooks they want to jack up your taxes they want to steal from you
[44:57.120 --> 45:03.840]  I won't let them they're gonna dummy up something to try to destroy me and and
[45:03.840 --> 45:09.460]  you know I thought well that guarantees our taxes are gonna go up they
[45:09.460 --> 45:14.840]  jacked up our taxes 67% they keep telling us this guy's a crook the courts
[45:14.840 --> 45:20.720]  freed him a jury said no this guy's in a crook at all and immediately I mean
[45:20.720 --> 45:24.480]  immediately they stream down court retrial and of course the government
[45:24.480 --> 45:28.400]  has endless funds to go after people they've never proven anything against
[45:28.400 --> 45:32.240]  this guy look do you know all I live in Illinois all these guys are crooks but
[45:32.240 --> 45:35.720]  but they haven't been able to prove anything on this kid so he says he's
[45:35.720 --> 45:40.760]  gonna talk and if he talks the house of Obama comes down Barry's house of cards
[45:40.760 --> 45:44.980]  comes well listen he better talk now because Ron Brown the Commerce Secretary
[45:44.980 --> 45:49.720]  was gonna go down he said I'm gonna talk and they and they shot him in the
[45:49.720 --> 45:53.160]  head and blew the airplane back of his head and have the special forces blow
[45:53.160 --> 45:58.800]  the hatch and he low high low out of the plane yes go ahead so you know the
[45:58.800 --> 46:03.440]  daily family Mayor Daly a famous name in Chicago he's gonna step down his brother
[46:03.440 --> 46:08.120]  replaces Rahm Emanuel Rahm Emanuel the head of the White House is coming to
[46:08.120 --> 46:15.000]  Chicago I know for a fact the number one guy and he's a great man he's a great
[46:15.000 --> 46:19.240]  man okay and maybe someday I'll talk about it I gave him my word that I
[46:19.240 --> 46:22.840]  would not and I'm telling you the guy that would have been the next Mayor of
[46:22.840 --> 46:27.960]  Chicago that is a great man got a personal call from his old political
[46:27.960 --> 46:33.880]  buddy Obama and Obama said look you can't run do not run and this this guy
[46:33.880 --> 46:38.560]  decided not to and I don't know what kind of I don't know what was said what
[46:38.560 --> 46:42.600]  was promised if there was threats Alex I don't know my point is here comes
[46:42.600 --> 46:45.760]  Rahm Emanuel to make sure all the bodies stay buried figuratively
[46:45.760 --> 46:49.680]  Blagojevich are gonna make sure he doesn't talk they want to make sure they
[46:49.680 --> 46:55.200]  protect I believe and I study this and I live this guys I believe they want to
[46:55.200 --> 46:59.000]  they want to protect the house of cars it is the Obama administration they
[46:59.000 --> 47:03.080]  don't want the truth to come out and this election less than less than half a
[47:03.080 --> 47:11.240]  million people voted in Chicago wow well I've got I've got the reports pouring
[47:11.240 --> 47:15.800]  out of Chicago of massive fraud and people saying that the fix was in but
[47:15.800 --> 47:20.960]  we all know there's never election fraud in Chicago yeah well you know the old
[47:20.960 --> 47:24.840]  joke is the dead vote I don't know that it's very funny but that's that's what
[47:24.840 --> 47:28.840]  everybody talks about man Cal finishing up here and yeah and I want to get
[47:28.840 --> 47:34.080]  reports I know you're very busy you know soon you are man in Chicago is Eric
[47:34.080 --> 47:39.040]  man Cal Muller man Cal calm but in closing going back to Rumsfeld I mean
[47:39.040 --> 47:44.280]  look yeah you asked me day on your show what is a 9-11 truth or well it runs the
[47:44.280 --> 47:49.600]  gamut but all I know is that Norman Panetta the the transportation secretary
[47:49.600 --> 47:53.520]  was in the bunker with Cheney 45 minutes earlier than Cheney said he was
[47:53.520 --> 47:58.280]  and testified before Congress that Cheney basically ordered a stand down of the
[47:58.280 --> 48:03.000]  F-16 to not shoot down flight 77 or whatever supposedly went over or into
[48:03.000 --> 48:07.240]  the Pentagon and so all I'm saying is man Cal I'll send you like you sent me
[48:07.240 --> 48:10.480]  the clip of Rumsfeld we appreciate it I'll send you the articles we've written
[48:10.480 --> 48:14.000]  with a bunch of video clips of cops and people going get back they're gonna blow
[48:14.000 --> 48:18.120]  up building 7 and it was on the news that well we may bring it down they blew
[48:18.120 --> 48:22.280]  it up and now Rumsfeld tells you I don't know what you're talking about I mean
[48:22.280 --> 48:29.320]  come on okay look Alex let's send me the audio I want it okay but look look

[54:15.320 --> 54:22.880]  down building seven can bring them down there are many other things the
[54:22.880 --> 54:26.400]  radiating of foster children the injecting people all over the world
[54:26.400 --> 54:29.400]  with live syphilis telling them it's a vaccine the globalists have been caught
[54:29.400 --> 54:36.160]  doing all of this but let's play that little short clip then we'll put a
[54:36.160 --> 54:41.720]  longer clip of you know Rumsfeld in context on the show but here's Donald
[54:41.720 --> 54:47.760]  Rumsfeld a couple days ago on Eric Mueller's show a man cow show pitching
[54:47.760 --> 54:52.320]  his book and saying I don't know anything about building seven you notice
[54:52.320 --> 54:56.000]  his voice really changes though compared to other clips from the interview he
[54:56.000 --> 55:00.840]  just gets very quiet very calm he gets in that fighter pilot mode that's what
[55:00.840 --> 55:06.040]  he is a fighter pilot he gets in that mode that v2 mode point of no return
[55:06.040 --> 55:09.160]  he just like I don't know anything about that no don't think about that building
[55:09.160 --> 55:13.800]  let's go ahead and play that clip building seven I often hear about a
[55:13.800 --> 55:17.520]  no-plane hit building seven why did building seven come down what do you
[55:17.520 --> 55:21.120]  tell people what is building seven or when it was a building five or the
[55:21.120 --> 55:25.960]  building that wasn't hit by the plane building seven I have no idea I've
[55:25.960 --> 55:36.480]  never heard that do a talk radio show oh I have no idea I've never heard of that
[55:36.480 --> 55:43.720]  did you hear his voice the deception in it I've never I have no idea I've never
[55:43.720 --> 55:48.400]  heard of that now we got a track through all his statements I'll guarantee you
[55:48.400 --> 55:51.840]  there's gonna be something about building seven and he skipped he's messed up a
[55:51.840 --> 55:54.400]  few times and talked about missiles hitting the Pentagon three or four times
[55:54.400 --> 55:58.680]  that we know of a bunch of other globalist have as well top generals but
[55:58.680 --> 56:01.720]  there he is people need to confront him everywhere not just about the missing
[56:01.720 --> 56:05.040]  trillions from the Pentagon but well you don't know about building seven your
[56:05.040 --> 56:08.400]  Pentagon Command Base in New York you don't know about the terror attack drill
[56:08.400 --> 56:11.720]  you were running with the CIA that day of those exact same buildings being
[56:11.720 --> 56:15.920]  attacked at the exact same time you don't know about that rumsfeld here's
[56:15.920 --> 56:20.840]  another clip of just some of their banter you're such a serious guy people I
[56:20.840 --> 56:23.600]  don't think realize I've been around just several times you have a great sense
[56:23.600 --> 56:27.680]  of humor what do you watch what makes you laugh I'd be curious well you know
[56:27.680 --> 56:36.960]  that NBC nightly news no the last movie I saw was Secretariat I wanted it to be
[56:36.960 --> 56:40.880]  the hangover or something like that no but I don't watch movies much I don't
[56:40.880 --> 56:46.880]  know why I mostly read history books and biography yeah TV shows I tell you I
[56:46.880 --> 56:52.240]  watch some news and I watch sports it just as I would expect I just wanted to
[56:52.240 --> 56:55.120]  hear you said that you sit around and watch 30 rockin you laugh I don't know
[56:55.120 --> 57:02.720]  no no I don't even know what it is you know what Lady Gaga is I've heard of
[57:02.720 --> 57:07.040]  her of course in a picture it says that startling and you're a big snooky fan
[57:07.040 --> 57:15.680]  it's no because I'm so sick of politician I mean come on ladies and
[57:15.680 --> 57:21.600]  gentlemen now you noticed on Super Bowl Sunday I took the crew out because we
[57:21.600 --> 57:25.800]  did the live show then to a steakhouse and Carl Rove was there three weeks ago
[57:25.800 --> 57:32.040]  and he wasn't following the Super Bowl either these guys don't oh they'll go to
[57:32.040 --> 57:36.520]  a Super Bowl to sit there as the Emperor at a gladiatorial event to make you
[57:36.520 --> 57:40.760]  think it's important and that they care but very few of these people George W
[57:40.760 --> 57:45.160]  was into sports obviously they're not into it they're not into TV they're not
[57:45.160 --> 57:51.120]  into movies they're into history books because those that know history can
[57:51.120 --> 57:58.240]  control the future and the present I am so blessed that my house growing up when
[57:58.240 --> 58:02.040]  my parents was filled with history books and when I was 10 11 years old I
[58:02.040 --> 58:06.080]  liked reading Louis Lamar and I happened to pick up some World War two bucks and
[58:06.080 --> 58:11.720]  boy that was the end of it and you just can't keep me away from it and then when
[58:11.720 --> 58:15.120]  you learn how governments work and you read hundreds and hundreds of history
[58:15.120 --> 58:19.480]  books a year don't have time to do it now I read boil down synopses you then
[58:19.480 --> 58:22.920]  start to see how humans act over and over again and the globalists are acting
[58:22.920 --> 58:27.480]  exactly how we would expect them to we got Porter Stansbury with bombshell
[58:27.480 --> 58:31.440]  information coming up at the five after break do this quick little five minutes
[58:31.440 --> 58:36.240]  on the other side dealing with the mind control very important of elements off
[58:36.240 --> 58:41.040]  to do more on this tomorrow this is I got too many gas stacked up
[58:43.320 --> 58:51.480]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network this is Alex Jones with
[58:51.480 --> 58:55.200]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[58:55.200 --> 58:59.000]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[58:59.000 --> 59:03.480]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[59:03.480 --> 59:07.720]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[59:07.720 --> 59:12.360]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[59:12.360 --> 59:16.320]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[59:16.320 --> 59:20.480]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[59:20.480 --> 59:24.440]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[59:24.440 --> 59:28.600]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[59:28.600 --> 59:32.400]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[59:32.400 --> 59:35.880]  power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors
[59:35.880 --> 59:41.840]  you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[59:41.840 --> 59:46.600]  remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call
[59:46.600 --> 01:00:00.400]  1-877-327-0365. Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:12.200]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:19.720]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:26.680]  Alex Jones okay coming up in the next segment throughout the rest of the hour
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:30.600]  five minutes into the next hour for Stansbury Stansbury Spansbury research
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:34.360]  will be joining us to get into his prediction that you're gonna see dollar
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:39.320]  plunging and devaluation in the next 12 months or so and boys since he first
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:42.920]  said that two or three months ago here you've seen that accelerate will get his
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:46.080]  view almost happening in the Middle East that he stabilization the riots he's
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:50.120]  predicted that as well his predictions have been called by Barron's and others
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:54.760]  a dire prophecy he will be he's made many predictions that have come true
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:59.840]  dealing with Fannie Mae Freddie Mac America's biggest mall owner general
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:06.560]  growth properties GM so he is coming up I should I'd spend a bunch of time on
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:10.080]  this but we just ran out of time with the Rumsfeld development that we just
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:13.800]  covered in the last hour he doesn't know what building 7 is Lindsey Williams is
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:16.880]  joining us coming up about an hour from now about an hour and five minutes from
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:19.880]  now a part two of the incredible interview yesterday we're gonna get into
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:24.080]  the in-game part we didn't really fully get into very important information we're
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:28.640]  also gonna quantify it Phil after the show really smart guy he said now
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:32.520]  exactly what's the double cross of the Arabs by the globalist and I think you
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:35.960]  know those of us that really study economics and these global deals we
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:40.480]  already know all this we don't really state it clearly so we'll do it very
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:46.520]  clearly coming up in the third hour with Lindsey Williams exactly what the
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:49.440]  double cross is and what the ramifications of this are and then
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:52.720]  dollar devaluation Lindsey saying the same thing he's saying it's not this
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.600]  year it's the end of next year but regardless we need to get ready for
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:58.760]  this and hopefully get the word on on the globalist might back off but
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:02.200]  mathematically many economists say there's it's a certainty it's a debt
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:06.080]  black hole that's fraudulent and possible to pay paybacks we're gonna be
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:09.160]  covering that then James Corbett going into overdrive in the fourth hour today
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:17.000]  joining us from Japan now continuing here I saw this article over the weekend
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:23.360]  from Farm Wars great great outfit it's up on info wars.com patent nervous
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:29.120]  system manipulation from TV monitors and this is exactly what Nick baggage
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:32.720]  was talking about a few months ago on the show saying look chemicals are the
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:36.440]  old way to control people in the food and water and yes that's going on and
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:42.160]  it's admitted they've been caught at nauseam at infinitum you know laundry
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:49.880]  list but he said electromagnetic is the way to go and light is the way to go
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:54.360]  because the eyes literally are sending programmed information to the brain now
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:03:00.280]  this was known back in the 1940s when a certain flicker rate was adopted for
[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:04.120]  televisions that wasn't even the highest quality or the best best type
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:12.120]  system to transmit you know didn't even reach as far what you transmit with UHF
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:16.320]  VHF AM FM I'm not an engineer but I've seen it explained to me has an effect
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:20.760]  on how far it goes how much power you got to send for but I'm getting too
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:24.040]  technical here and I guess I'll have to cover it more tomorrow the the issue is
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:29.160]  the flicker rate it's it's it's admitted that it causes brain degeneration it's
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:34.480]  admitted it causes the brain to go into a catatonic sleep type state it's
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.200]  admitted that it mesmerizes people you've ever been talking to your kids
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:40.640]  if they're watching TV it's why don't let my kids watch hardly any television
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:43.920]  and they're just like hey hey and they're watching and they're just like
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:48.600]  zombies and you go over to a friend's house or watching TV and get a beer
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:53.560]  out of the refrigerator popcorn or coke you're like hey do you hear about that
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:04:01.240]  at work today or how's your wife doing you're like hey Bob Bob oh and then
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:04.280]  they can't even hardly talk to you can be a really smart person when you see
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:07.920]  him at work or on the street or at a football game or whatever but when
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:13.040]  they're watching TV it's more than just suspended disbelief where you go into
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:17.280]  fantasy land and then your subconscious accepts all of the program messages you
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:22.320]  know that are played out there there's an overlay that it puts you in that
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:27.200]  highly suggestible state but that's not what these patents deal with US patent
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:35.920]  number six five zero six one four eight this particular patent deals with
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:39.600]  programming the brain and manipulating the central nervous system to make you
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:44.600]  angry happy nauseous the computer can actually control the mind and now they
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:50.240]  can do their high-def TV even better computer monitors but it gets worse they
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:53.480]  now want to quote have data transmission they're already over power lines that
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:58.320]  then interface with the light bulbs and do a flicker oh man this is hardcore
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:03.200]  stay with us Alex told you the government announced recently that the
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:08.280]  recession is over it ended on June of 2009 the millions of Americans unable to
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:12.360]  find work might not agree perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:15.640]  government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be getting worse
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:20.000]  gold and silver haven't heard the news either they've begun their long expected

[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:20.040]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:23.520]  Alex Joe's
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:31.520]  I've been aware of the poor Stansbury's incredible research for many years Wall
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:36.840]  Street Journal has said that he's amongst some of the most astute researchers
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:41.840]  and people that can forecast what's coming in the economy Barron's called
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:48.360]  his work a dire prophecy when he predicted with total precision years
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:53.080]  before what was going to happen with Fannie Mae Freddie Mac GM general growth
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:57.240]  properties the biggest mall owner and a whole other laundry list and now he's
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:01.400]  making his biggest breakdown or prediction yet he's saying in the
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:06.200]  next 12 months or so that they believe that there's something going to happen
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:10.160]  that is going to basically end what we know is America and of course that's
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:14.040]  dollar devaluation the end of the dollars the World Reserve currency now
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:18.600]  some of my connections to oil company execs and others they're saying 2012 but
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:24.040]  regardless this information is key and we're going to be going over it with
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:26.640]  him till five minutes in the next hour than Lindsey Williams with an
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:32.880]  information that completely couples and and and and dovetails everything
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:38.760]  Porter Stansbury's talking about join us for part two of that record rated show
[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:43.000]  yesterday I mean just blew everybody away our servers had smoke coming out of
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.880]  them and we've got a next to record audience today just on the downside of
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:50.440]  that so people are really responding they're really starting to listen and
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:55.240]  this is extremely powerful information but we want everybody to go to end of
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:59.480]  America the number three dot com that's end of America the number three dot com
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:04.120]  if you want to see all the incredible daily reports the free video that breaks
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:07.800]  all this down where he goes through all the graphs all the documents and if
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:12.120]  you've already seen it send the end of America the number three dot com to
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:15.800]  everybody you know so that they can be warned because knowing this is coming is
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:19.360]  one of the only ways we can brace for the crash landing every economist we talk
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:22.560]  to says we had Mark Fiber on two days ago that guy who's on the board of
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:26.920]  dozens of Fortune 500 companies he said it's guaranteed total collapse but he's
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:31.840]  saying you know it could be longer in the future and and mirrors what Porter
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:35.160]  Stansbury saying the Stansbury it's an even more detail you know the point is
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:39.760]  we're crashing but at least we can warn people to brace themselves and I tell
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:44.920]  the story about and I'll go to Porter was probably seven years ago I was
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:49.280]  visiting family in Fredericksburg Texas in my Tahoe and thank God that there were
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:53.120]  so many family going out there that my dad and I just wrote in the Tahoe my
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:58.480]  wife and my mother and my two children at the time rode in her facade and they
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:01.760]  will about 30 minutes before my uncle's looking off the mountaintop that he lived
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:06.360]  on at the time and he said the hilltop he said you better leave those storms
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:09.920]  look bad he went in and looked on the internet and tornadoes were forming you
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:13.840]  know 20 miles away show my wife and everybody my grandma too they all left
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:17.640]  30 minutes before as I stayed to shoot some more guns drink some more coffee
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:23.640]  and and driving home we got blown off the road by a tornado we didn't know it was
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:26.240]  a tornado when the state police got there they said you know the road a
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:29.800]  tornado just blew you blew down some barns and houses when we drove into
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:34.640]  Johnson City power lights were out cars were turned over but I'm driving I'm
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:39.160]  going about 55 it's raining boom tornado comes through throws me off down a 50
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:44.480]  foot embankment we're spinning but it's like when time slows down and then we
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:47.720]  start shooting backwards down the gully and I told my dad I said brace for impact
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:53.880]  we're in seat belts he braces we slam into it and it crushes the Tahoe all the
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:57.880]  it was one of the big Tahoe's from the back all the way into the back seats both
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:02.680]  of our seats break back in the impact my dad got a concussion started vomiting a
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:08.440]  few hours later I was okay but the point is I said brace for impact and I and I
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:12.520]  think that you really helped us now that I'm done with the analogy but ladies and
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:15.560]  gentlemen the tornado we don't a lot of people don't know what's coming
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:19.080]  Stansbury's saying tornadoes right there he's predicting it's gonna hit us on
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:24.280]  the road take a vase of action Porter is that a good way to put it yeah I think
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:28.240]  that's exactly right because as you said you've had economists after economists
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:33.160]  on your show there's really no doubt at all about what the consequences of what
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:37.520]  the Federal Reserve is doing to our money will be the only question is when
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:41.880]  and you know reasonable people can have differences of opinion about that
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:45.440]  because as you know predictions are difficult especially about the future
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:49.520]  so there isn't any question at all that there's a tornado down the road the
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:52.680]  only question is how hard is it going to hit us how far is it going to throw us
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:59.200]  and what I'm telling people is you want to err on the side of caution and you
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:03.920]  know I was on two and a half months ago and I told everybody at that time look
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:08.360]  food prices are going to go to the moon right now and as you know that's
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:13.160]  exactly what happened and that spawned revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt and
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:17.560]  demonstrations that I ran and all these things are part and parcel of the same
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:22.160]  problem and they're going to get a lot worse and the folks who think that these
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:25.960]  problems are going to ricochet back into America but they're deceiving
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:28.880]  themselves you know the union demonstrations that are just getting
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:32.360]  started are only going to be the first wave of this well I remember what you
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:35.280]  were on two and a half months ago or so I've been begging to get you back so
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:38.800]  busy I've been able to and I know you know you got family stuff coming up your
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:42.480]  wife getting ready to have a baby was that okay to say absolutely yeah yeah
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:45.920]  and we're excited about our second son but I've been begging you to come back
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:49.440]  on the show and we're so honored because of all the people we've interviewed you
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:52.640]  really have laid it out I'd have to say the most accurate we can rear that
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:55.240]  interview right now people will think it was today you said it's going to cause
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:58.800]  riots it's going to cause destabilization it's going to come here
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:02.160]  and it's going to start sooner than these other economists are saying and I'd
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:05.680]  say that's the difference with you they like to hedge their bet and claim two
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:10.400]  years three years you're saying no the next 12 months yeah I was saying in
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:13.560]  November that food prices would double the next six months they pretty much
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:17.720]  already have I'm saying that gold and silver prices are going to go up by at
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:22.000]  least 50% they're well on their way I'm saying that there is going to be no
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.320]  improvement to the employment problem whatsoever and I'm saying that there will
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:30.840]  be at least two major state bankruptcies in the next 12 months all of this is
[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:35.520]  related to the same issue and the issue is blindingly simple there were there
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:41.360]  were tons and tons and tons of bad loans that were made during the the 2000s
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:46.360]  and housing industry and also to corporations those bad debts have never
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:50.280]  been written off they were transferred from people like Bear Stearns and Lehman
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:55.520]  into the US Treasury that's that's all a matter of fact it's been widely reported
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:15:00.520]  all that that debt is now being papered over by the Federal Reserve which admits
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:05.760]  to creating at least two trillion dollars worth of new money to paper over
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:09.360]  those bad debts well that two trillion dollars worth of new money isn't going
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:13.320]  to disappear it's causing huge dislocations right now in the market
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:18.440]  for food and energy and later it's going to cause huge dislocations and other
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:23.040]  monetary instruments like gold and silver and other kinds of debts and of
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:26.920]  course all this problem is going to destroy our currency it's going to make
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:31.040]  it impossible for the federal government to finance its ongoing debts and you're
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:35.600]  seeing that right now at the state level where state governments are literally
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:45.160]  going bankrupt well Porter going through the numbers though going through
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:48.720]  you know the details for people and then what you think they can do to protect
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:54.320]  themselves I mean break that down for us it's really very very simple the first
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:16:00.800]  thing that you have to do is you have to figure out how vulnerable you are to a
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:04.720]  government default okay look the value of the dollars gonna fall by at least 50
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:08.640]  percent over the next 12 18 months there's no doubt about that okay so your
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:12.560]  standard of living is going to collapse unless you're able to either one
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:17.560]  greatly increase your wages or two greatly increase the value your assets so
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:20.800]  you got to buy things that are going to be resistant to inflation things like
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:26.320]  gold things like silver things like farmland secondly I'm urging people to
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:30.800]  build up a strategic stockpile of things like critical medicines things like food
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:34.480]  and water now I know this sounds a little crazy I understand that and I'm not an
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:38.020]  alarmist you can look at all my newsletters they're all published on my
[01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:42.000]  website danceberryresearch.com everything I've ever written for the last 15
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.440]  years is posted there I have never made a prediction like this before I'm not the
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:49.000]  guy who says this guy is falling okay this guy's falling tomorrow okay this guy
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.120]  is falling next week okay the guy this guy is falling next month I'm not that
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:57.640]  person I'm saying to you look at the facts two trillion dollars of new money
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:03.280]  has been created in the last 18 months there there is runaway debt formation at
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:08.000]  a federal level there is runaway visible debt at the state local level that
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.480]  cannot be financed we are in the middle of a crisis people keep asking me when
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:16.800]  the crisis is going to start and I'm telling you it's here right now how many
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:19.720]  banks are going to have to fail before you are going to realize something's
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:22.880]  wrong with the economy how many states are going to go have to go bankrupt how
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:25.880]  high is unemployment going to have to get how high is the price of gold and
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:29.920]  silver have to go before you realize man it's not safe to hold the dollar and
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:34.120]  the reason I tell people about the strategic reserve that I want to build
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:38.680]  in their homes is because when the state government employees all walk out on
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:42.480]  strike and they will okay you're not going to be able to send your kids to
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:46.080]  school you may not be able to use the highways you may not be able to go to
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:49.240]  the grocery stores we don't know what the impact of all these things by the way
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:52.280]  you said that on the show several months ago and have been writing about it in
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:56.480]  the last year half the school shut down in Detroit but it's not just Detroit
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:01.520]  Oakland California the police chief announced 20 no 30 plus crimes including
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:06.400]  robbery that they are not gonna respond to now sheriff's departments laying off
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:14.840]  over 60% I see these reports pouring in right now yeah again you know you don't
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:18.120]  want to be you know you don't want you don't want your city or your hometown
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:25.560]  your state to be the first place that experiences really bad revolt but it's
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:28.920]  going to happen I mean there's a Democrat today in Massachusetts who's
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:32.040]  telling the unions it's time to get a little bit bloody yeah that's in the
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:36.840]  Associated Press he's saying he's saying blood is good sometimes it's good to get
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:42.120]  bloody these are the people blaming conservatives and in the fetters when
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:47.800]  that liberal drug addict shot the congresswoman Giffords they're the
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:51.760]  ones saying our free speech putting out financial information is causing
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:56.600]  violence they attack Ron Paul and myself on CNN and MSNBC blaming us for no
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:19:00.480]  reason but meanwhile the Democrats are running around and Obama's saying you
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:03.760]  know they bring a knife we bring a gun the Democrats are saying let's get bloody
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:07.760]  they're gonna turn their little commies loose on us yeah let me let me bring
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:11.520]  something else up Alex I mean I don't I don't like to draw a lot of attention to
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:15.360]  you know the safety issues that I personally have because you just make
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:18.920]  some problem worse but you wouldn't believe the things that have been mailed
[01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:22.560]  to me sent to me dropped off at my office threatening me and my family
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:26.920]  people believe that because I'm saying there's a problem that I am the one
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:32.120]  causing the problem that is insane I did not print the money I did not make all
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:36.080]  the bad loans I did not prevent the banks from filing a bankruptcy which is
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:39.200]  what they should have done I'm just trying to warn people about this problem
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:43.840]  and these other guys are you're right they're gonna incite violence and it's
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:48.080]  gonna be a big mess well we know what the globalist always do they they create
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:52.000]  the crisis and they turn loose the unwashed dumbed-down masses to rape and
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.480]  rob and pillage and and engage in thuggery against the middle class

[01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:13.280]  America the number three dot com the headline on drudge is from CNBC US
[01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:21.840]  crude oil crosses the $100 mark rent tops 110 so you see where the futures are
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:26.120]  going they're going straight up because of dollar devaluation and triggering
[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:28.600]  unrest because people don't have enough food I want to get Porter's take
[01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:32.040]  specifically on what's happening in the Middle East now spreading to Europe
[01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:36.960]  Asia and the United States but here's the Hill newspaper headline Democratic
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:41.560]  lawmaker on labor protest get a little bloody when necessary so there they are
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:46.040]  calling for insurrection because these people are working for the globalist
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:49.200]  they're working for Obama and they tell us that we're the violent ones in
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:54.200]  Porter Stansbury is getting threats I get threats constantly because the
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:57.920]  establishment wants to continue to position themselves to make record
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:02.800]  profits for the big banks siphoning the money off for themselves while keeping
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:06.120]  everybody else in the dark correct Porter you're absolutely right about that
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:11.760]  Alex you know there are two ways to handle an excess of debt to your economy
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:15.600]  you can you can no longer afford your debts you've got two choices you can
[01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:19.160]  declare bankruptcy make your creditors take a haircut right that would have
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:22.840]  involved studying down the banks and having the people who who were
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:27.360]  depositors in those banks take big losses or you can do the dishonest thing
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:32.240]  which is to print up a bunch of money and allow and I mean if it interest rates
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:37.160]  to allow an effect banks to be the recipients of huge amounts of new
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:41.160]  inflation which is exactly what they have done and the result is that poor
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:44.560]  people from around the world can't can't afford food anymore because Alex as
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:49.800]  you understand food everywhere in the world is priced in dollars and so is
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:54.920]  oil and those are the two things that people need the most the fastest any
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:58.160]  food and they need energy and in the third world countries as you know on
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:01.480]  average more than half of their paycheck is spent on food and energy
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:04.840]  that's right so the first thing that happens when you have a huge inflation
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:09.520]  is food and energy prices go bananas and then you get the resulting unrest and
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:14.080]  all that stuff will lead to other prices soaring as well because as these
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:18.000]  emerging markets fall apart all the stuff that we're used to importing
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:21.800]  cheaply is going to go way up and destroys confidence for investment
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:25.400]  absolutely and of course now you're going to see you're gonna see the Fed
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:29.720]  you'll see Bernanke say oh I had nothing to do with this isn't it my fault these
[01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:33.440]  are these are internal political problems so these other countries it's all
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:37.160]  a bunch of garbage the reason why all this stuff is happening is because of
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:40.640]  food and energy prices and I have to tell you Alex most people think oh this
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:44.720]  will be the end of it this is just the beginning the Fed cannot stop printing
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:49.080]  money because there is no other way to finance our debts people don't understand
[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:52.720]  this we've never had trillion dollar deficits before I mean those are
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:56.400]  outrageous numbers not only not only that we keep having them there was one in
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:01.760]  2009 there was one in 2010 there's gonna be one in 2011 and in 2012 there is no
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:05.680]  there is no one not a Republican not a Democrat no one who's talking about
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:09.360]  running a balanced budget a month after they announced that they want 100
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:13.960]  trillion additional in QE to at Davos they've now announced that they want a
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:20.080]  hundred trillion on top of it QE 3 I mean this is it this is insane it is not
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:23.920]  going to stop the number is going to get bigger because once you go down this
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:28.720]  path of running constantly larger deficits the only way to finance them is
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:34.000]  with inflation and that's how I knew going back as early as 2006 2007 that
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.880]  this was gonna happen and if you read my back my old newsletters you'll see
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:42.120]  this is not a new prediction for me it's simply the time when the inflation is
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:45.760]  erupting we're gonna go to break in a moment long segment coming up but I
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:52.200]  wanted to play the new TV ad and people can go to Stansbury media on the YouTube
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:56.640]  channel and watch it or you can watch CNN and many other channels and see it
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:00.200]  if you're a radio listener prison planet TV viewers obviously can can watch it
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:04.280]  right now but here's the new Stansbury research a national ad you may
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:10.240]  recognize the voice US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:14.320]  the most important day in America in more than 50 years he says it will change
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:18.520]  everything about our lives the way you shop travel invest educate your
[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:21.760]  children and even how you take care of your health and your own family now this
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:25.320]  man has made some outrageous predictions of the year but here's the thing he's
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:29.240]  usually right you see he predicted the collapse of GM Danny May Freddie Mac
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:33.240]  and America's biggest mall owner in fact Barron's called his work a dire
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:35.760]  prophecy

[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:25.440]  just briefly I want to say though I'm honored because I believe in the message
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:28.600]  you're putting out well you know I think that you're one of the most

[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:49.720]  spreading
[01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:59.400]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:06.080]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:11.560]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:15.320]  we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home I've tremendous
[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:20.360]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:25.760]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:30.680]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:35.080]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world

[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:42.760]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:48.280]  like nobody does care right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:54.000]  the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars dot com

[01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:08.080]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:12.320]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:16.600]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:20.960]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:25.040]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:29.600]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:33.720]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:37.680]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:41.520]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:44.240]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from

[01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:09.280]  important day in America in more than 50 years he says it will change

[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:24.440]  part is he's usually right you see he predicted the collapse of GM Danny May
[01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:28.320]  Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner general growth properties in fact
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:33.080]  Barron's called his work a dire prophecy recently he created a video which you

[01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:17.400]  the fact that you're getting threats to you and your family we get them all the
[01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:20.120]  time a little veiled things like how are you and your family doing hope your
[01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:24.840]  children do well better shut up I mean is that similar to what you're getting
[01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:29.360]  yeah you know it's the anonymous letters in the mail that are you know the
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:33.240]  vaguely threatening you know pretty out stuff from the internet sending it to me
[01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:38.080]  at my home that kind of thing it's it's a it's childish but somebody like you
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:42.120]  that only makes you work harder doesn't it I you know I don't know how the world
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:46.600]  you think the life that's gonna make me be quiet I mean you know I want you to
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:50.000]  know Alex that you know we've I've never spent any money advertising on
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:54.840]  television ever as you know it's expensive it's hard to do but but also
[01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:58.600]  you know it wasn't ever worth the investment to me but this was big
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:03.080]  enough these ideas are I'm so sincere about them and I am so
[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:07.280]  legitimately concerned about them that I went ahead and spent the money and you
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:11.960]  play the television at a moment ago on the radio but did you know that none of
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:15.960]  the four major networks would broadcast it not one of them not even Fox
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:20.920]  instead we had to go to the satellite networks in order to get the placements
[01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:24.640]  we couldn't buy directly from the networks they wouldn't sell to us and for
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:28.240]  those that don't understand how advertising works you can't get their
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:32.720]  ad block times you can only get the satellite companies that are limited
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:38.040]  who overlay some of their ads as part of their deals to carry the the
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:43.160]  transmission on satellite correct hey that's right that's I'm not the expert
[01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:46.720]  on it but that's apparently what our brokers had to do for us and I mean
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:49.240]  there's nothing in that ad you just played it there's nothing offensive
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:54.640]  whatsoever it just is a clear warning I'm just telling people look at the very
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:35:00.520]  least see a free video educate yourselves I mean how could that possibly be
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:06.480]  thought of as being you know in any way offensive or or you know violating any
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:09.480]  kind of community standards it doesn't make any sense but let me just let me
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:12.960]  just reiterate something you talk a lot about there is no doubt in my mind
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:16.640]  that none of the large institutions the United States whether it's corporates
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:21.200]  corporate entities or whether it's government entities nobody wants the
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:25.880]  American public to understand how paper money works and how the impact of this
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:30.760]  new wave of inflation is going to impact the everyday regular person they don't
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:34.640]  want that information out there because as long as you the average person don't
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:38.320]  understand it they have a huge advantage over you well here's an example Ron Paul
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:43.280]  two years in a row wins the key CPAC straw poll he's hammering this paper
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:48.480]  money versus you know gold silver issue and the inflation tax that he hammered
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:53.920]  in the 2007 2008 campaign and almost none of the media would even report that
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:58.560]  he'd won and Fox superimposed imposed and admitted to it later said it was a
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:04.160]  mistake fake booze from a year before another event over Ron Paul to claim he
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:08.120]  got booed I mean they are not just scared of your info or my info they're
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:12.040]  scared of anybody that tells the truth yeah they definitely don't they don't
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:15.960]  want the they do not want the average person to be empowered they want you to
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:21.440]  be enslaved by debt they want you to be you know manacled to the paper money
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:26.560]  system they don't want you to escape or be free Porter this censored ad that
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:30.960]  they're trying to keep from airing on the main transmissions on ABC CBS NBC you
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:37.160]  name it Fox CNN what's the best website I know I'm just throwing this at you but
[01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:41.600]  what's the I mean folks can obviously go to Stansbury media search that term on
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:45.680]  YouTube and find your official channel but what's the best website
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:49.240]  standsburyresearch.com end of America number three dot com I mean now you have
[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:52.520]  the long video on end of America three dot com but where can they find the
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:57.600]  actual TV ad I would recommend that everybody first go to end of America
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:01.680]  three dot com okay go there first because that's the important thing my the
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:05.600]  future of my TV ad is small potatoes compared to the information that you're
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:10.080]  gonna get from my long video about the impact of this company TV ads just
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:13.880]  pushing them to the real video the TV ad is just for entertainment to get your
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:16.960]  attention to get you to go look at this information go to end of America three
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:20.840]  dot com whether you buy my newsletter or not doesn't matter my newsletter is only
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:24.320]  forty nine dollars it's not a lot of money but that doesn't even matter at the
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:28.000]  very least understand what's gonna happen and understand the basic ways to
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:33.520]  protect yourself the gold the silver having some basic strategic stockpiles
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:37.800]  if you can invest in a farm like not not buy a farm but you know invest in a
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:40.760]  farm co-op something like that those things are gonna really help you and
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:43.920]  your family deal with the crisis that's coming hey Porter I don't just talk to
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:47.680]  talk I walk the walk I have just evacuated to the countryside I'm gone
[01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:51.840]  I'm out of Austin good for you good for you I think you're you and your family
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:56.440]  were gonna be much safer out there absolutely now now in the time we've
[01:37:56.440 --> 01:38:00.520]  got left about 25 minutes here Porter you've got the floor I got a million
[01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:04.400]  questions here but get into what you predicted now what's unfolding how you
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:09.360]  see those cascading dominoes you know how you see this unraveling well let me
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:14.080]  let me tell you this yesterday was the first day when the markets around the
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:18.080]  world finally woke up to the extent of these problems I don't know if you notice
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:23.360]  this or not but you know stocks fell sharply yesterday right yes so the one
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:27.080]  thing that I would tell people is if you don't you don't like my style you
[01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:30.360]  don't like my advertising okay that's fine you think I'm wrong about the
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:34.720]  these ideas okay well we'll see but one way to judge what I'm saying
[01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:38.880]  objectively is to look at the recommended portfolio in my newsletter
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:43.680]  I've got about 15 different investment positions that I recommend people take
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:50.760]  okay and yesterday my portfolio went up okay the markets fell by two three
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:55.880]  percent my stocks went up how if I'm right I'm wrong the only way that can
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:39:00.320]  happen is if I'm right about these ideas and there's no doubt in my mind that I
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:04.040]  am dead right about these ideas as you know you've been following my
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:08.440]  predictions for a long time and at first believe me people were laughing at this
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:13.360]  kind of stuff they're not laughing anymore and and you really only have a
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:17.400]  little bit of time left to try to get out of the dollar and to try to protect
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:20.680]  yourself financially for what's going to come yeah the proof is in the pudding
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:26.640]  and we see oil rocketing past a hundred dollars a hundred and ten on the foreign
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:33.120]  exchanges golden silver going ballistic right now and the riots intensifying and
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:37.520]  the main driver is the food the main driver right now is the food and listen
[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:41.960]  the food is going to upset pretty much every emerging market in the world and
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:46.680]  let me be the first to say this on record with you okay Pakistan is going to
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:51.760]  fall Pakistan is going to end up in a civil war this year and the next six
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:56.840]  months why Pakistan is the world's largest importer of wheat they're
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:00.200]  incredibly dependent upon the value of the dollar from the subsidies they get
[01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:04.240]  from the US government their regime will fall and that is going to have
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:08.440]  enormous consequences for the our national security and for that area
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:13.600]  strategically okay that'll happen for sure this year so I mean these
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:17.040]  problems are not going to go away they're going to get worse and they've
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:20.920]  got nuclear weapons they do have nuclear weapons the next thing that's going to
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:26.320]  happen okay after the food prices have soared and the emerging markets all
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:29.720]  around the world have had these these that this unrest of these problems the
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:34.160]  next thing that's going to happen is energy prices okay oil is going to keep
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:38.680]  rising and if it's food prices that cause the problem in emerging markets it is
[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:42.880]  energy prices that will cause the problems of the developed markets soaring
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:48.200]  energy prices are going to cause massive massive unrest particularly in
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:51.800]  western Europe where the government's budgets have already been stretched to
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:56.400]  the point of breaking so look for energy prices to be the things that cause the
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:00.480]  big problems in the developed countries this year
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:06.800]  Porter you mentioned the situation in Pakistan the king of Saudi Arabia I'm
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:10.000]  looking for the article I had it here earlier I believe it says 23 billion
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:14.080]  dollars that he's going to pump out to the population they're admitting it's
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:17.760]  because they're based in dollars their currency is based in it and their prices
[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:23.520]  are going up with a large portion of the population on welfare the same thing
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:28.280]  the US government has announced along with the EU in fact here's the headline
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:33.480]  US EU prepares to buy off post-revolution governments with billions in
[01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:37.960]  aid they're desperately because of the hyperinflation that they have have
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:42.680]  triggered understand that this is happening so they're there pumping more
[01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:47.840]  fiat currency out which then only exacerbates the problem of the buying power
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:52.480]  so it may stave things off for a little while but studying why my republics in
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:57.320]  Bobway Argentina I know you've studied it explain to people how this thing
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:42:02.480]  telescopes towards the end it always accelerates that's exactly right out
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:06.200]  that always accelerates and the reason why it's really simple to understand if
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:10.280]  you know how interest works so you borrow a lot of money and then you can't
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:13.320]  afford the interest so you have to borrow still more money to pay the interest
[01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:17.360]  well now your debt grows bigger and it pyramids and you've got it exactly right
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:22.320]  so what happens is sooner or later these debts come to a size where the only way
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:26.080]  to manage them is by printing and that is the stage that we are at right now
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:31.840]  it's simply math Alex the the total domestic savings in the United States
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:36.520]  is around six hundred billion dollars a year okay we're running a one point five
[01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:41.160]  one point six trillion dollar deficit which means we're a trillion dollars
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:45.320]  more or less in the hole every year we got to borrow from somebody now for
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:48.640]  years and years and years we were borrowing from the Chinese they have
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:51.960]  begun to sell their treasuries which means they're not buying new debt issues
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:56.280]  the only way we can finance these debts is by printing and that is exactly what
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:43:00.080]  is happening and the ramifications of that printing is what's causing the
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:03.720]  unrest right now and the emerging markets particularly the Middle East where
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:09.080]  there's a huge food shortage but that is going to trigger soaring
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:12.920]  energy prices and that is gonna what that is what will cause the problems in the
[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:17.440]  U.S. you think the unions are upset right now we'll wait until gasoline costs
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:21.040]  five dollars or six dollars or ten dollars at the pump then you're gonna
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:26.400]  see some upset unions if they're willing to get bloody over over you know some
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:29.920]  healthcare but benefit things where they have to start paying five and six
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:33.360]  percent of their healthcare costs imagine what they're gonna do when they
[01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:39.480]  can't put gas in their trucks it's unbelievable briefly getting back to
[01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:46.280]  censorship the system doesn't want your ads on national TV the government we
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:50.480]  just saw it in Egypt you're decrying the shutoff of the internet the decrying of
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:56.640]  the shutoff the internet in Libya which you know is legitimate to decry that but
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:00.520]  then Obama and the federal government are now trial ballooning saying yeah we
[01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:04.680]  got a bill where we can shut off the internet or redirect any websites we
[01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:09.200]  want to government messages the federal government's accelerating seizing in
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:13.000]  some cases hundreds of thousands of websites a week now two weeks ago they
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:17.440]  grabbed 84,000 innocent websites and put a homeland security message up that they
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:21.640]  were involved in child porn turned out it was a mistake but they're really now
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:24.880]  coming out in the open Jay Rockefeller talking about the internet kill switch
[01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:28.520]  and cyber security how there's gonna be a cyber attack and they'll have to shut
[01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:31.520]  the web down when that happens of course they'll launch the cyber attack and
[01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:35.200]  then use that as the pretext to shut it down I mean they we need to get this
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:39.400]  information out now because as this unfolds you better believe folks if it
[01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:42.760]  gets as bad as it could yeah yeah I mean it's in the cards that they're gonna
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:46.440]  shut this radio show off and you're not gonna be able to get to stansbury.com I
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:50.600]  think we should take out from the weapons arsenal today the Google bomb I

[01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:57.400]  take about three hours to do it put it in Google over and over again one word
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:45:03.160]  end of America the number three and not the numeral not spelled out just three

[01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:41.440]  in game.com but I think I think that's probably harder to remember than in game

[01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:14.720]  world by getting you in debt that they want to use making you poor to turn us
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:17.920]  all into the unwashed masses like the poor folks in the third world so that we

[01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:41.360]  and end of America the number three.com let's send them both to the top ladies
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:45.600]  and gentlemen and see how the globalists like it. Porter your comment on the open
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:48.640]  announcements that they want to have fairness doctrine for talk radio that
[01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:51.920]  oh we need to shut up and not criticize the government or we cause violence that
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:56.040]  we need internet to to come in that we need an internet kill switch. Well
[01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:59.720]  listen all I can tell you is that believe it or not right now we have
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:05.800]  subpoenas at my company by the Social Security Administration. Why in the
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:08.880]  world with the Social Security Administration to be sending me subpoenas
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:13.840]  and the answer to that is because I publish a report that showed people how
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:18.800]  they could get more benefits out of Social Security so I told people how they
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:22.880]  could how they could start getting at 62 and then raise the level of their
[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:26.880]  benefits when they turn 65 it was completely legal it was a secret loophole
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:30.400]  that only insiders in Washington knew about I published a whole report about
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:35.200]  it and so now in retribution the Social Security Administration is coming
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:39.960]  after me telling me that I don't have the right to print the words Social
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:44.040]  Security. I'm not making this up this is a lawsuit that's going on right now with
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:47.660]  my business. Well that's a thought crime that you've committed Porter
[01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:53.720]  Stansbury. You know some of the things that have happened to me as far as being
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:57.400]  sued by the government I would have never believed unless it actually happened
[01:47:57.400 --> 01:48:01.280]  to me but it actually they had there's a law in the books that says you're not
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:06.280]  allowed to write or publish the words Social Security now of course that the
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:09.160]  Social Security Administration doesn't sue every newspaper that prints those
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:12.800]  words they don't sue every media outlet for using those words they just go
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:16.640]  after the folks who they don't like so if you spill their secrets they're gonna
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:19.280]  come after you and that's what they're doing to me right now. But they're
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:22.600]  already going to destroy our society to begin with so this is just survival
[01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:26.600]  instinct we've got to do what we're doing just like the Alamo we just got to
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:29.640]  stand up and that's the end of it and they may get us but they're not going to
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:33.840]  get everybody else because people are going to say remember Alex Jones remember
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:40.040]  Porter Stansbury remember the Alamo. Well you know it does get tiresome to have a
[01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:43.840]  big target on your back though doesn't it? I mean so why not just go with it why
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:47.640]  not just love it then? I mean are you I mean come on this is the United States of
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:53.120]  America you can't actually sue me for writing a report can you? Oh yes you can
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:58.840]  because it's a myth the whole idea that we're free is completely a myth and I
[01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:02.240]  know that you and I we talk about this all the time and it was to our various
[01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:05.880]  audiences and you know I think a lot of times people think that we're a little
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:09.960]  off base until they start getting into the facts until they start seeing what's
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:12.800]  actually going on and right there in front of us. Let me stop you with the
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:16.520]  dirty tricks this is just breaking huge on the Drudge Report it's also going up
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:22.480]  on info wars.com ABC News National ABC Wisconsin governor pranked by reporter
[01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:26.240]  posing as a billionaire conservative activist Walker reveals plans to break
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:32.160]  Democratic Union opposition on call with billionaire David Koch and our Coke
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:37.000]  and then it goes on. The prankster pretending to be the billionaire also
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.920]  asked Walker whether troublemakers should be planted in the protest
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:44.080]  presumably to discredit their efforts. Walker reveals that he and his aides had
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:48.520]  thought about that but decided against it. My only fear would be that if there
[01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:52.280]  was a ruckus cause that would scare the public into thinking that maybe the
[01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:57.000]  governor's got to settle to avoid all these problems Walker said so there's
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:01.520]  govern the governor reportedly saying he'd already entertained provocateurs
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:05.040]  well the Democrats have been caught all over the country with violent
[01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:12.400]  provocateurs posing as Tea Party people. Yeah but I mean what's you know the
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:16.720]  thing that I'm curious about is and I hope that you'll think about this as
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:22.760]  well as it doesn't make any difference whether the governor forces the unions
[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:27.200]  to back off or not it doesn't make any difference because Wisconsin is facing a
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:32.080]  two billion dollar deficit so it doesn't even matter who's in the governor's
[01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:36.920]  office the government the state of Wisconsin is broke so all these guys
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:39.720]  are doing is they're fighting over a bunch of crumbs it doesn't make any
[01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:42.880]  difference. Yeah the Titanic has already hit the iceberg and they're fighting
[01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:46.440]  over silverware on the deck stay there when we come back I want to talk about
[01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:51.120]  these Wall Street Journal reports and others that are saying 42 states are
[01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:54.360]  already essentially bankrupt the feds are preparing to take them into
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:59.640]  receivership but the feds are bankrupt it's a shell game.

[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:48.200]  burning up time here I wish I wasn't I want to get you back soon know you're
[01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:52.720]  very busy but my grandmother two years ago she lives in a very humble home in
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:58.200]  South Austin live there for 20 plus years my grandfather's dead she is you
[01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:01.560]  know doing okay but quite frankly I've had to give her a little bit of money
[01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:06.960]  over the years just to for groceries I guess that's not doing okay and my dad
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:11.760]  helps out as well and you know it's it's my mom's mother sweetheart she's on
[01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:16.080]  my only grandmother got left eighty eighty seven years old now and just
[01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:20.880]  incredible but they they tried to come and take her social security and make
[01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:24.280]  her fill out forms and harass her so they're running normal people out of
[01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:28.600]  social security that paid into it you discovered an inside deal that federal
[01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:34.080]  employees were doing you told folks from 96 to 2010 and when people found out
[01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:37.760]  about it and started using it they got rid of the program that's why federal
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:41.000]  employees are so mad at you explain what you explained to me during the break
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:46.560]  yeah you got the dates a little bit wrong but in 2006 one of my researchers
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:51.280]  found a loophole social security that would allow you to increase your
[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:55.680]  benefits you know that if you start taking benefits when you're 62 they'll
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:59.640]  start paying you out but it's at a decreased level or you can wait until
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:04.120]  65 and you get the full level right you you know that's how it works we found
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:07.080]  that there was an actual loophole that you had to know about you could just
[01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:11.720]  call it so security when you turn 65 and you could fill out some forms and then
[01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:16.160]  you would automatically be getting this higher level and we started publishing
[01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:20.480]  this as a report and the report says you know in big bold letters we are not the
[01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:24.600]  social security department we are an independent research company this is our
[01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:28.480]  report about how to get a higher level of social security it was simple it was
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:31.800]  it was totally there was no allegation that we that we weren't telling the truth
[01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:36.000]  there was no allegation of fraud it was an a an actual thing that you could do
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:39.600]  and we have thousands of satisfied customers who did it well we have so
[01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:43.120]  many people that did it in 2010 they eliminated the program and now today
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:49.440]  they're suing us for writing it and they're saying you're not allowed to tell
[01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:53.000]  people what's going on with their social security think about the magnitude of
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:57.520]  that this is Orwellian it really is there's actually a wall that was passed
[01:56:57.520 --> 01:57:03.480]  in the 1960s that makes it against the wall to publish the words social security
[01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:08.600]  you're not allowed to write those words there were forbidden words only in
[01:57:08.600 --> 01:57:14.200]  America where you're where you're free or you have First Amendment rights but
[01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:17.400]  again they're mad because you ended the little secret loophole they'd written
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:21.360]  for themselves that does exactly what happened then you can talk to you know
[01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:24.600]  you can talk to not not don't you have taken from me you can talk to anybody
[01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:27.480]  associated with the program and they'll tell you that's exactly what happened
[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:32.160]  well I remember the buzz on that by 2008 or so with your work on it I remember
[01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:35.080]  people learning about it and I remember being in the news when they got rid of it
[01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:38.960]  people got mad and again that's why they can't allow this free open internet
[01:57:38.960 --> 01:57:42.000]  any longer are you concerned they're gonna try to shut the web down during
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.640]  crises oh I think that's exactly what they're gonna do I mean that's the
[01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:48.400]  whole point of the switch I think it's gonna be very interesting to see is
[01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:52.600]  technically they can do it because the internet was actually designed to
[01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:57.000]  withstand a nuclear attack that's the whole way is structured so that any
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:00.120]  individual node can continue to function there is no that's what cyber
[01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:04.240]  security is though is they're putting their machines in all of the routers so
[01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:08.120]  they can they're changing the nature of it I understand that I understand that
[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:11.240]  but I'm telling you I think it's gonna be interesting to see if they can pull it
[01:58:11.240 --> 01:58:14.720]  off because I don't think it's really possible I think they can definitely
[01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:18.840]  impact most Americans ability to get on the internet but I don't think they can
[01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:22.880]  shut down the entire internet oh quarter don't be wrong I totally agree with you
[01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:26.000]  you're absolutely right look at Egypt after four or five days they had to turn
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:29.600]  it back on because it made commerce totally come to a halt that's the main
[01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:32.720]  reason they can't do it back in one minute with five minutes summation of
[01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:36.920]  other key info and ideas you've got and proven track record for folks who try to
[01:58:36.920 --> 01:58:46.160]  protect themselves stands very research dot com you are listening to GCN visit

[01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:06.000]  government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be getting worse

[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:42.360]  know the most important thing for me Alex is that people take the time you know
[02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:46.600]  set aside ten minutes today go to end of America three dot com look at my
[02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:50.640]  presentation it's free judge it for yourself don't rely on on what I've
[02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:53.800]  said or what you hear from Alex make your own decision about what's best for
[02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:58.600]  you and your family then if you agree that there is a problem and it's gonna
[02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:03.160]  get worse then take reasonable steps to protect yourself I'm not telling
[02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:06.960]  everybody you know go bear go bury yourself in a cave or anything like that
[02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:12.240]  I'm saying buy some gold buy some silver have a strategic stockpile of
[02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:16.760]  goods in your home things like medicines that you can't live without some basic
[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:22.320]  food some basic fresh water that kind of stuff you know guns ammunition the basic
[02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:25.920]  things that you would need to protect yourself and your family if there was a
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:31.640]  period of time where the social order was breaking down and again I will tell
[02:01:31.640 --> 02:01:36.640]  I'll tell you straight up Alex I don't think that it's likely that you're gonna
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:41.600]  have a violent confrontation and most places in America but I do think it's
[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:45.520]  likely that you will have violent confrontations somewhere in the country
[02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:50.440]  this year so let me call them let me call them places like Detroit Los
[02:01:50.440 --> 02:01:56.280]  Angeles Chicago absolutely New York Miami Houston you know people think that
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:02:01.080]  rioting about food is only gonna happen in places like Pakistan and Egypt but
[02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:06.920]  you're forgetting there are more than 40 million Americans on food stamps and the
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:11.240]  purchasing power of food stamps is going to collapse because of inflation it's
[02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:15.720]  about to hit 44 mil yeah well what do you think those people you you know who
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:19.560]  these people are what do you think they're gonna do when they can't go out
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:24.000]  and get their their milk and their cigarettes with a lottery ticket yeah
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:28.760]  when they can't get their peps blue ribbon or their or their drugs it's
[02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:33.520]  gonna turn into absolute burning bad lump yeah and and and they're gonna of
[02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:37.280]  course they're gonna they're gonna blame it all on on the likely suspect they're
[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:41.080]  gonna blame it on the speculators they're gonna blame it on you know
[02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:45.640]  middle-class Americans who who are now gonna be seen as hoarders right so if
[02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:49.120]  you've gone and bought gold and silver that you're now a hoarder and you're
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:55.080]  causing the inflation when of course it was the paper money to start with well
[02:02:55.080 --> 02:02:59.200]  they're gonna say you didn't give the people more welfare you you you cut
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:04.000]  things you caused it when it's a debt black hole a lot of economists I have on
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:07.960]  even the Washington Post says 600 and something trillion other economists say
[02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:13.560]  1.5 quadrillion in derivatives layered debt I mean from your research what's
[02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:18.120]  the real amount of derivatives floating around out there the number is
[02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:22.680]  astronomical I don't even have that number at the top of my head but I mean
[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:28.240]  the the one good way to think about it is just to think about how levered Fannie
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:33.240]  and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are okay these are the largest mortgage firms and
[02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:38.640]  the world they hold something like six trillion dollars worth of mortgages and
[02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:42.840]  guess what they're bankrupt that there is no equity underlying any effect that
[02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:46.520]  was no six trillion have all been sold over and over again into the market and
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:51.960]  then leveraged again and then insurance bought on them to the moon right and
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:57.160]  you know if you added if you added the true liabilities of Fannie and Freddie
[02:03:57.160 --> 02:04:00.480]  onto the national debt which is what you should do because they're now
[02:04:00.480 --> 02:04:04.600]  completely worth of the state then all of a sudden the national debt goes from
[02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:09.240]  14 trillion all the way to 20 trillion and we're way over a hundred percent of
[02:04:09.240 --> 02:04:13.600]  GDP and debt we're in so much debt as I've explained we can't even finance it
[02:04:13.600 --> 02:04:17.640]  and as a result the only way to make the ends meet is printing money which is how
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:21.520]  I know they're not going to stop and how I know the inflation is going to get a
[02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:25.120]  lot worse technically is it accurate that a lot of analysts say we're worse
[02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:31.240]  off than Greece and Spain no that's there's not out about it we total debt
[02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:36.120]  all public and private United States is around 400% of GDP that's the same level
[02:04:36.120 --> 02:04:41.360]  that Iceland had when Iceland collapsed by 90% unbelievable it's only gonna get
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:44.640]  worse well at least we're here warning people and getting demonized for it
[02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:49.240]  end of America the number 3.com porter I know that baby's coming soon but I

[02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:05.920]  good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:09.720]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[02:07:09.720 --> 02:07:14.080]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[02:07:14.080 --> 02:07:18.440]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:22.920]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[02:07:22.920 --> 02:07:27.640]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:07:27.640 --> 02:07:31.440]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:35.080]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[02:08:18.560 --> 02:08:22.880]  well for the next hour pastor lindsay williams joins us know this is a
[02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:28.520]  yesterday show he's back with us today the 23rd day of February 2011 on this
[02:08:28.520 --> 02:08:32.080]  Wednesday edition we're going to overdrive in the fourth hour live with
[02:08:32.080 --> 02:08:37.520]  the good old fella from the Corbett report so it'll be his maiden voyage with
[02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:42.680]  us here on air james Corbett really looking forward to that okay I asked
[02:08:42.680 --> 02:08:49.760]  lindsay yesterday to go back and first do the history of this deal being set up
[02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:55.480]  in the 1970s with the Arabs to have them by our T bills or the globalist T bills
[02:08:55.480 --> 02:08:59.400]  the Federal Reserve and hijacked things by then completely and that then the
[02:08:59.400 --> 02:09:03.680]  federal government would try to restrict oil exploration and development and
[02:09:03.680 --> 02:09:09.440]  and and delivery and we know in about half the countries held in federal hands
[02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:14.080]  and that's where most the oil is Alaska Utah Rocky Mountains areas of Texas they
[02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:19.920]  just shut it down that's on record and I got emails and questions people thought
[02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:22.520]  it was phenomenal and also frightening information but it's good to know what's
[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:26.680]  happening from Lindsay's inside sources one who's now deceased Ken from former
[02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:31.160]  head of operations Lenic Richfield the other guy former CEO of a company well
[02:09:31.160 --> 02:09:34.760]  company all of a big three oldest we can't say his name he's still alive and
[02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:39.880]  gave Lindsay news just three four days ago on this that's the new info and how
[02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:42.320]  they're going to double cross the Arabs and I got emails saying how was that a
[02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:45.440]  double cross well if you make a behind-the-scenes deal back with Henry
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:50.080]  Kissinger in the 70s that we're going to stop the Americans from getting the oil
[02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:53.520]  so we need it from you but then you've got to invest it with us see if they let
[02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:57.320]  free market companies go in they couldn't do a sweetheart deal and order
[02:09:57.320 --> 02:10:00.880]  those companies to buy nothing but t-bills but by going to dictatorships
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:05.400]  run by you know corrupt people like Hussain Mubarak run by corrupt people
[02:10:05.400 --> 02:10:10.720]  you know I can Saudi Arabia the royal family Bahrain the list goes on and on
[02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:17.640]  Yemen by doing that then they could have that inside deal and control the
[02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:21.440]  price and Lindsay again told four months ago this double cross was coming now
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:24.880]  he's been given all the info and it's happening that's the double cross
[02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:29.240]  because when they stop buying stuff from the Arabs and claim it's because you
[02:10:29.240 --> 02:10:33.160]  know oh it's so destabilized that will give them the excuse to start
[02:10:33.160 --> 02:10:39.760]  development here and it will also deep peg oil worldwide from the dollar and
[02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:43.640]  will signal an acceleration of the death of the dollar and his inside sources
[02:10:43.640 --> 02:10:47.480]  said that no it's going to be at the end of 2012 many other experts say this
[02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:51.760]  year early next year whatever we're going it's a freight train going over the
[02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:56.080]  edge of a cliff and it's a mathematical certainty every economist Mark Faber
[02:10:56.080 --> 02:10:59.080]  Ron Paul's an economist not just a medical doctor he's been given you know
[02:10:59.080 --> 02:11:04.520]  honorary degrees from facilities for papers he's written the point is Webster
[02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:09.280]  Tarpley economist doctor of history Dr. Paul Craig Roberts former head of the
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:12.920]  Treasury Department policy number two father of Reaganomics I mean I could
[02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:17.040]  George Humphrey former city council member economist the real mark of an
[02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:19.560]  economist is how successfully is in business but I won't get into that
[02:11:19.560 --> 02:11:26.960]  oh let me tell you he's a humble guy they all Humphrey told me this in 1998 he
[02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:31.640]  produced audio CDs off his book what do you call it common sense I remember
[02:11:31.640 --> 02:11:34.720]  listening to it driving around in the car and having him on the radio show
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:38.640]  about the derivatives and the tens of trillions and what it would do and how
[02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:44.680]  it was a setup so the point is we're now entering the danger zone it's here it's
[02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:49.960]  v2 it's point of return again v2 is when you're taking off in a jet on a runway
[02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:53.200]  the point where there's not enough runway to stop you're gonna crash you got
[02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:58.560]  to go ahead and try to take off your v2 we're now entered v2 we're in v2 and so
[02:11:58.560 --> 02:12:02.000]  I wanted to get Lindsay up to explain this but also I got another email saying
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:06.200]  well wait a minute some of what I heard Lindsay say it wasn't new this is the
[02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:11.600]  one-dimensional thinking people nitpick on they go here's an article a text of
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:15.360]  what William said years ago and it's the same thing yet that's the whole point
[02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:19.280]  we got him to give you the whole history and to go over his book the energy
[02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:23.640]  non-crisis published in 1980 we said that 45 million times let's be technical
[02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:28.000]  probably 60 70 times yesterday yes that's the old info that integrates with
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:31.960]  the new info that's now here but now we're not gonna go back into the past
[02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:36.120]  except for Ken from and a speech he gave with went Lindsay and the threats at the
[02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:39.840]  time in the early 80s to understand what's happening now and then more of
[02:12:39.840 --> 02:12:43.480]  what his still living source and from just three months ago before he died
[02:12:43.480 --> 02:12:47.200]  told him about the relationship with China what was gonna happen in America
[02:12:47.200 --> 02:12:50.840]  but here we are we're gonna talk about 20 minutes with Lindsay getting into the
[02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:54.240]  other areas he hasn't covered then we're gonna open the phones up for phone
[02:12:54.240 --> 02:13:01.080]  calls for questions for Lindsay Williams at 800 259 92 31 but we're limited in
[02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:03.840]  time if you call up we don't screen your calls if you bring up something else we
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:07.840]  got to let you go because Lindsay's here right now for this purpose but Lindsay
[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:12.720]  Williams great to have you back with us Alex thank you the standard currency of
[02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:16.720]  the world is crude oil and I think we could all see for what you just said
[02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:23.000]  that things are happening right now that that are unusual up in the course of the
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:27.040]  program today I'm going to tell you exactly how much crude oil the United
[02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:32.320]  States of America has I'll give you actual numbers of barrels as they say is
[02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:36.640]  in four different reserves you'll readily understand and this is from the
[02:13:36.640 --> 02:13:40.480]  insider and do what they're doing and while you were on yesterday oil went up
[02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:46.600]  9% how much is it up today well is somewhere around $10 up today you will
[02:13:46.600 --> 02:13:52.880]  see at least 25 to 30 cents increase at the gas pump problem by them my next
[02:13:52.880 --> 02:13:57.960]  week Lindsay you're batting almost perfect here three and a half years ago or
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:01.000]  three years ago give me the dates exactly we wrote articles about it it's on
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:05.600]  record you said it's gonna go from $50 a barrel to 150 did it now you said it's
[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:09.320]  gonna go down to 40 people laughed at you boom did it right on time then you
[02:14:09.320 --> 02:14:12.720]  said we got two years till it starts rocking back up then four months ago
[02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:17.120]  you say it's going to 150 or even 200 within six months to a year boom it's
[02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:21.320]  begun I mean look I know the name of the former oil company CEO one of the big
[02:14:21.320 --> 02:14:26.280]  three who you're talking to still alive this is real info unless he's giving us
[02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:29.960]  disinfo they could give you good info for a long time they give you a lie later
[02:14:29.960 --> 02:14:35.480]  that's the only way you could be wrong Alex I am not a prophet yes I'm a
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:39.960]  Christian I'm a minister of the gospel I am not a prophet it was by the
[02:14:39.960 --> 02:14:43.960]  providence of God that I met these people years ago gained their confidence
[02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:48.400]  two of them have kept in touch with me over the past 35 years and everything
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:53.720]  that you have just mentioned that I have told was told to me by one of these
[02:14:53.720 --> 02:14:58.760]  whom I call the elite of the world now let's begin as you did in the program
[02:14:58.760 --> 02:15:06.960]  today 1977 through 1981 an agreement was made by the then Secretary of State with
[02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:11.960]  the opaque oil producing countries of the world in particular the Middle East
[02:15:11.960 --> 02:15:17.880]  they had found oil there about 60 years ago each one of the major oil company
[02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:22.520]  shale texaco standard oil Chevron divided up the Arab world and each one of them
[02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:30.120]  produced an oil field then of course they became the elite the ones that had
[02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:34.320]  the most and doing the most then Henry Kissinger comes along your Secretary of
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:39.320]  State goes to those countries that had been produced by the major oil companies
[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:44.400]  read the book the three sisters if you'd like background on all of this and he
[02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:49.760]  said I want to cut you a deal we will be glad to buy your oil and not produce
[02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:53.720]  American oil this is so important what you just said this is the key to the
[02:15:53.720 --> 02:15:58.680]  whole thing we will not produce America's oil fields they know it's there
[02:15:58.680 --> 02:16:02.600]  I'm going to tell you how much is there later in the program but they said we
[02:16:02.600 --> 02:16:09.200]  will not produce America's oil field we will buy oil from you if you will take
[02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:14.080]  a certain portion of everything that we buy oil from you with and buy our key
[02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:19.520]  bills our Federal Reserve issues can you see at this point everybody out there
[02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:25.120]  in the listening audience I beg of you realize that the crisis of money and the
[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:30.000]  financial situation and the depression that we're in right now or recession as
[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:34.880]  they call it every bit of this was in the works and planned way back in the
[02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:38.960]  70s they knew about it even in the 60s what they were going to do and you wrote
[02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:45.040]  about it 31 years ago but no excuse me you wrote about it 1971 man time flies
[02:16:45.040 --> 02:16:50.280]  that's almost 40 years ago and so looking at this Lindsay because we've
[02:16:50.280 --> 02:16:53.560]  already covered that yesterday just explain to people how that's a double
[02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:56.800]  cross some of them don't understand what you just said even though it's as
[02:16:56.800 --> 02:17:05.240]  plain as a barn door now the crisis that took place in Egypt they predicted it to
[02:17:05.240 --> 02:17:11.080]  me and I gave it on your show Alex please tell the audience I gave this on
[02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:17.880]  your show back four months ago I was told that within four to five months there
[02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:23.120]  would be a major crisis in the Middle East I announced it on your show and it
[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:26.960]  took place in Egypt was the beginning of it Alex do you remember me saying that
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:30.880]  yes I do but but Lindsay just quantify it for folks that that haven't read your
[02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:34.800]  book because I guess it I mean it is complex explain how it's a double cross
[02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:38.440]  I mean if they stop buying the Arabs oil and develop it here that's going to
[02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:42.520]  totally send the Middle East who's on welfare into a tailspin because they've
[02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:46.480]  had the oil money to produce a giant population but they can't grow their own
[02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:53.160]  food true now what they did was they created this crisis and it's going to
[02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:59.200]  spread all over the Middle East Gaddafi right now is saying that Libya if he's
[02:17:59.200 --> 02:18:04.440]  ousted that he will destroy all the oil fields in Libya before he leaves 1.6
[02:18:04.440 --> 02:18:09.280]  million barrels a day that goes to Europe you know what this is going to
[02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:13.840]  the price of crude oil this is spreading it was Egypt now it's Libya it will go
[02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:18.720]  right on to every one of the Middle East oil producing countries Jordan Tunisia
[02:18:18.720 --> 02:18:24.920]  Turkey Saudi Arabia every single one of Yemen they're all going to see riots and
[02:18:24.920 --> 02:18:30.440]  this will bring about or will precipitate the the production of oil in the
[02:18:30.440 --> 02:18:35.200]  Middle East will cease as we know it today now this is very important because
[02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:39.960]  at this point can you imagine what will happen to the price of oil when Saudi
[02:18:39.960 --> 02:18:43.560]  Arabia says we can no longer supply for the United States of America because we
[02:18:43.560 --> 02:18:47.520]  have riots and civil unrest in our country this will bring the price of
[02:18:47.520 --> 02:18:52.360]  crude oil and the price of gasoline the gas pump in America to six seven eight
[02:18:52.360 --> 02:18:57.680]  maybe even ten dollars a gallon of the gas pump if you can even get it what is
[02:18:57.680 --> 02:19:02.320]  this going to do to the American dollar I was told that the dollar will be dead
[02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:08.000]  by the end of 2012 how does this relate to the Arab oil world because the the
[02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:13.120]  oil producing countries of the world a group exception of Iran and Iraq have
[02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:17.720]  been buying our debt they've been buying our tea bills all federal reserve
[02:19:17.720 --> 02:19:22.400]  issues they've been buying them since way back in nineteen and so they won't be
[02:19:22.400 --> 02:19:26.040]  able to buy as many they won't be able to buy as many that will further weaken
[02:19:26.040 --> 02:19:29.880]  the dollar they won't be selling as much oil that will further hurt their
[02:19:29.880 --> 02:19:34.640]  economies and it'll cause a domino effect and that's breaking the deal the
[02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:41.520]  globalist made with them on the 70s that's the double-cross correct Lindsey
[02:19:41.520 --> 02:19:47.600]  that is correct and when they when they can't produce over there and in America
[02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:51.440]  that we have financial problems to the point that the federal reserve key bill
[02:19:51.440 --> 02:19:56.400]  the tell what Lindsey stay there let's accelerate to the rise of China and what
[02:19:56.400 --> 02:19:59.560]  you were told on that and how it integrates into the u.s. their plans for

[02:24:37.840 --> 02:24:41.440]  okay summing it up the info we didn't have time to get into on the rise of
[02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:45.160]  China what the globalists are going to do to the US the oil that they're going
[02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:48.560]  to open up and where how much of it there is directly from this former big
[02:24:48.560 --> 02:24:53.360]  three oil company CEO they don't want to come back and go back in time to the
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:56.840]  information you've never been able to talk about with Ken from dealing with
[02:24:56.840 --> 02:25:00.680]  that speech you gave with him again all this was hiding in plain view Lindsay
[02:25:00.680 --> 02:25:06.200]  please continue the civil unrest in the Middle East is going to grow worse and
[02:25:06.200 --> 02:25:10.440]  worse it will grow from one nation to the other I know that many of you
[02:25:10.440 --> 02:25:14.960]  probably are having a difficult time understanding exactly how this is going
[02:25:14.960 --> 02:25:19.080]  to be a double cross with the Arabs and please let me try to put it simply if I
[02:25:19.080 --> 02:25:24.080]  can because this is new to you it was new to me until I received it a few days
[02:25:24.080 --> 02:25:30.800]  ago the the OPEC or producing countries have been buying our T bills as an
[02:25:30.800 --> 02:25:36.720]  agreement it was way back into 70s at the time that the dollar collapses and you
[02:25:36.720 --> 02:25:41.120]  know this is going to happen it's been said by the economist of America I have
[02:25:41.120 --> 02:25:45.200]  been told it'll happen by the end of 2012 do you realize that all of that
[02:25:45.200 --> 02:25:50.520]  paper that those are all producing countries of the Middle East have that
[02:25:50.520 --> 02:25:55.320]  they have been buying by obligation of agreement made back into 70s do you
[02:25:55.320 --> 02:25:59.200]  realize that all of that paper will become worthless overnight now watch
[02:25:59.200 --> 02:26:06.000]  the chain of events as the Middle East conflict conflict and unrest continues
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:11.020]  from Libya to all of the others including Saudi Arabia at that point they
[02:26:11.020 --> 02:26:15.480]  cannot produce the oil to send it to America and to the rest of the world
[02:26:15.480 --> 02:26:19.760]  not only America but the rest of the world right now Libya supplies 1.6
[02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:23.800]  million barrels to Europe that was cut off it's going to be cut off because to
[02:26:23.800 --> 02:26:28.560]  get off is on its way out now when Saudi Arabia can't supply it to America what
[02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:33.160]  happens to the American dollar whenever gasoline goes to 8 to 10 to $12 a
[02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:36.000]  gallon if you can even get it what happens to you the economy with the
[02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:40.320]  groceries go up that means that the American dollar is on its way out and
[02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:45.800]  will collapse when it collapses all the paper that these oil producing opaque
[02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:49.960]  oil producing countries have in the way of T bills and Federal Reserve issues
[02:26:49.960 --> 02:26:55.080]  will be worthless overnight what does that bring about that means then that
[02:26:55.080 --> 02:26:59.400]  they have been double-crossed the man that called you from Egypt on yesterday
[02:26:59.400 --> 02:27:04.920]  on the program Alex he said that the people in Egypt know that what took
[02:27:04.920 --> 02:27:11.000]  place in Cairo was staged they thought it was staged by the CIA I'll tell you
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:15.560]  who it's staged by it was staged by the people who give me this information they
[02:27:15.560 --> 02:27:20.040]  told me four to five months in advance and I announced it on Alex Jones show
[02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:24.120]  that it would happen now I'm telling you it's going to spread it'll spread to the
[02:27:24.120 --> 02:27:28.160]  point they can't produce their oil they won't be able to provide it for us and
[02:27:28.160 --> 02:27:33.360]  by the end of 2012 you will see their paper become worthless they will be
[02:27:33.360 --> 02:27:38.560]  livid they will be so angry against America now how is this going to affect
[02:27:38.560 --> 02:27:44.200]  what takes place over here here is the plan of the elite they in turn will
[02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:49.920]  begin to open up America's oil fields that they have known for years they have
[02:27:49.920 --> 02:27:54.680]  known for 20 to 30 years they existed they're going to open these oil fields
[02:27:54.680 --> 02:28:00.040]  and produce from America's own soil why because mr. prom said to me back in
[02:28:00.040 --> 02:28:06.000]  1976 never forget the conversation he said chaplain we will not open the
[02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:10.440]  Gull Island oil field and produce it for the American people until we have
[02:28:10.440 --> 02:28:16.240]  gotten the price of crude oil to 250 to 200 dollars a barrel they will have it
[02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:20.920]  200 dollars a barrel before the end of 2012 in turn they will become the
[02:28:20.920 --> 02:28:24.680]  filthy as rich people you could ever imagine because they'll open America's
[02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:30.240]  own oil fields because at that point the Middle East can't provide for us the
[02:28:30.240 --> 02:28:34.240]  Arabs have been double-crossed they realize what's happened to them and
[02:28:34.240 --> 02:28:39.600]  that they have been had their paper is worthless the oil producers now produce
[02:28:39.600 --> 02:28:45.520]  from America's own soil but watch what happens to China this is so important
[02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:50.840]  you remember I said to you nearly two years ago that I had been told China is
[02:28:50.840 --> 02:28:55.760]  the big one first the Middle East will flare up then you won't be watching but
[02:28:55.760 --> 02:28:59.760]  China will be then the big one China is going to be the big one and China will
[02:28:59.760 --> 02:29:05.360]  not be affected at all please notice this China will not be affected at all
[02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:10.760]  by the crisis is going to take place in crude oil because China and Russia made
[02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:15.880]  an agreement just a matter of weeks ago that Russia who by the way as of last
[02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:20.520]  year Russia surpassed Saudi Arabia in oil production is the number one producer
[02:29:20.520 --> 02:29:24.720]  in the world because of that super deep wells which is a story within itself that
[02:29:24.720 --> 02:29:30.320]  Bp tried to imitate the Gulf of Mexico and couldn't and now China won't be
[02:29:30.320 --> 02:29:35.560]  affected at all because Russia has an agreement that they will supply all of
[02:29:35.560 --> 02:29:40.720]  the crude oil and natural gas not just crude oil but natural gas also so China
[02:29:40.720 --> 02:29:46.040]  and Russia rising the US in turmoil global police state in place Europe
[02:29:46.040 --> 02:29:51.760]  rising I think I've read this in a book written 2,000 years ago we're on the

[02:33:33.040 --> 02:33:37.920]  developments not today we're rushing to get to the new information and then what
[02:33:37.920 --> 02:33:43.040]  the elite told him the master plan is now going beyond the rise of Russia and
[02:33:43.040 --> 02:33:47.040]  China what else did they tell you about this because you wanted to tell you the
[02:33:47.040 --> 02:33:50.600]  night when we talked and I just sat there and listened this decline of the US
[02:33:50.600 --> 02:33:54.560]  that's playing but then they plan to rise it back up again that is so important
[02:33:54.560 --> 02:33:59.240]  tell us tell us the long-term strategic geopolitical ramifications well
[02:33:59.240 --> 02:34:02.960]  because of the civil unrest over the Middle East they will basically be
[02:34:02.960 --> 02:34:07.240]  impotent they will not be able to produce we begin to produce from our
[02:34:07.240 --> 02:34:15.520]  own soil Alex we were able to obtain just within the past 24 hours a visual
[02:34:15.520 --> 02:34:21.840]  not only audio but visual sound bite of the Muslim Brotherhood during one of
[02:34:21.840 --> 02:34:27.680]  these sessions and I think it was in Egypt where they actually were crying
[02:34:27.680 --> 02:34:32.960]  out we are going to Israel to kill Jews it literally set cold shields up and
[02:34:32.960 --> 02:34:39.120]  down my spine when we got this and you've got to see what's going on now
[02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:43.480]  what's going to happen basically is we will begin to produce from our own oil
[02:34:43.480 --> 02:34:47.560]  fields so I want to give it a moment if I can how much oil we have known reserves
[02:34:47.560 --> 02:34:51.680]  but we'll be begin to produce now from our own oil fields anybody in the oil
[02:34:51.680 --> 02:34:55.640]  business you're going to get filthy rich anybody in the drilling business get
[02:34:55.640 --> 02:35:00.040]  ready get all the equipment you can get they when the Middle East can no longer
[02:35:00.040 --> 02:35:05.320]  provide the American dollar collapses the Arabs become extremely angry at us they
[02:35:05.320 --> 02:35:10.240]  have lost their wealth in their T bills and several reserve issues we in turn
[02:35:10.240 --> 02:35:15.960]  begin to produce from our own oil fields and then at this point the new world
[02:35:15.960 --> 02:35:19.480]  order basically has everything though where they want it you've heard me say
[02:35:19.480 --> 02:35:25.000]  before that I was told that one does when the dust settles they will own
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:29.680]  every piece of mortgage real estate in the United States of America because
[02:35:29.680 --> 02:35:34.360]  people can't make their payments for the price of crude oil goes to $200 a barrel
[02:35:34.360 --> 02:35:39.840]  you've paid $7 and $8 a gallon at the gas pump you go to see this by the way
[02:35:39.840 --> 02:35:46.160]  gasoline in our area went up three to five cents per day last week right here
[02:35:46.160 --> 02:35:51.960]  in Arizona it's over $4 a gallon in California already I saw $4 a gallon
[02:35:51.960 --> 02:35:56.640]  per diesel when I was in town the other day right here in Arizona you will
[02:35:56.640 --> 02:36:00.640]  easily see six seven eight dollars a gallon think of what this is going to
[02:36:00.640 --> 02:36:04.480]  do to the economy and when the economy gets to that point you can't make your
[02:36:04.480 --> 02:36:08.200]  house a payment they can't make the payment on that shopping center people
[02:36:08.200 --> 02:36:12.800]  won't be able to buy they'll barely be able to buy food will be relegated to a
[02:36:12.800 --> 02:36:18.640]  third-world status at this point the elite basically will break the back of
[02:36:18.640 --> 02:36:23.800]  the American free enterprise system this is their goal because they only buy
[02:36:23.800 --> 02:36:27.840]  things after they've bankrupted it when they can get it for pennies on the dollar
[02:36:27.840 --> 02:36:33.920]  the airlines the railroads no matter what it may be their gold is total control
[02:36:33.920 --> 02:36:39.760]  the name of the game is control then we produce from our own oil fields whenever
[02:36:39.760 --> 02:36:44.000]  they open up all of these massive oil fields in America the elite will
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:49.920]  gradually over a period of years now not overnight but over a period of years
[02:36:49.920 --> 02:36:55.080]  they'll begin to bring America back again to the great American dream under
[02:36:55.080 --> 02:37:00.720]  their control it'll be a different world and what we know it today their plan is
[02:37:00.720 --> 02:37:05.320]  to bring it back again and whatever they do they will give us back some of what
[02:37:05.320 --> 02:37:08.640]  we have now just enough to be able to keep the people exactly where they
[02:37:08.640 --> 02:37:13.400]  want them now if I can Alex may I give a little bit of what we have in the way
[02:37:13.400 --> 02:37:19.680]  of crude oil and I want to tell you the places where they're going to use it yes
[02:37:19.680 --> 02:37:24.600]  Lindsay go ahead okay first of all the USG a lot now folks please you can prove
[02:37:24.600 --> 02:37:28.240]  that's for yourself you'll have no trouble getting this information the US
[02:37:28.240 --> 02:37:34.560]  Geological Service issued a report on April of 2008 that only scientists and
[02:37:34.560 --> 02:37:40.600]  oil men knew were coming they didn't have a slightest idea up until that time it
[02:37:40.600 --> 02:37:46.520]  was a revised report hadn't been issued since 1995 on how much oil was in the
[02:37:46.520 --> 02:37:51.240]  area of the Western two-thirds of North Dakota Western South Dakota and
[02:37:51.240 --> 02:37:56.920]  Montana here it is the back end is the largest oil discovery says Prudhoe Bay
[02:37:56.920 --> 02:38:03.640]  and has the potential of eliminating all American dependence on foreign oil you
[02:38:03.640 --> 02:38:06.680]  don't want to go back and write much of this down afterwards the Energy
[02:38:06.680 --> 02:38:13.480]  Information Administration estimated that the back-end reserve is 503 billion
[02:38:13.480 --> 02:38:20.080]  barrels even if just 10% of the oil is recovered at $107 which you won't be at
[02:38:20.080 --> 02:38:24.200]  that point by the way I'll add it'll be $200 a barrel because this report was
[02:38:24.200 --> 02:38:30.320]  back number of years ago he said we're looking at a resource based worth 5.3
[02:38:30.320 --> 02:38:35.680]  trillion folks do you realize that would pay off all of the national debt at $200
[02:38:35.680 --> 02:38:41.480]  a barrel let me continue when I was first briefed on this Terry Johnson said
[02:38:41.480 --> 02:38:46.760]  he's a Montana legislative financial analyst he said that he gave this by the
[02:38:46.760 --> 02:38:50.680]  way said the congressional record he said the congressman almost dropped their
[02:38:50.680 --> 02:38:55.640]  their law job here it is this size will find is now the highest producing on
[02:38:55.640 --> 02:39:02.640]  your oil field in the past 56 years the Pittsburgh Post Good Set said it is a
[02:39:02.640 --> 02:39:06.720]  formation known as the Williston Basin there you'll hear the back-end you'll
[02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:11.160]  also hear the words Williston Basin it is more commonly referred to as the
[02:39:11.160 --> 02:39:17.120]  back-end it stretches from northern Montana to North Dakota into Canada for
[02:39:17.120 --> 02:39:23.280]  years the U.S. oil exploration they have known it's there this is no surprise to
[02:39:23.280 --> 02:39:27.560]  the elite they knew the major oil companies knew it is there now they
[02:39:27.560 --> 02:39:32.120]  have the technology but I'll tell you what it is this this was just in this
[02:39:32.120 --> 02:39:37.080]  report the other day that this info general gave me he said this is light
[02:39:37.080 --> 02:39:41.120]  sweet crude you know what that means that two different kind of oil yes well
[02:39:41.120 --> 02:39:44.880]  there's crude oil and then there's sweet and then there's the light sweet you
[02:39:44.880 --> 02:39:49.480]  can basically almost not even process or refine light sweet it can almost go
[02:39:49.480 --> 02:39:53.840]  right in the engine that's correct with just a little filtration you could put
[02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:58.480]  it right into a diesel engine the light sweet crude and the back and all reserve
[02:39:58.480 --> 02:40:03.480]  is light sweet crude and it can be produced are you ready hold on it can
[02:40:03.480 --> 02:40:12.640]  be produced for $16 per barrel on our own soil that is 60 cents a gallon at the
[02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:16.840]  gas pump if the elite would give it to you did you hear those figures but you
[02:40:16.840 --> 02:40:21.360]  won't get it for that you'll get it for seven to eight dollars a gallon at the
[02:40:21.360 --> 02:40:26.760]  gas pump because crude oil by that time will be $200 a barrel now may I go on
[02:40:26.760 --> 02:40:33.440]  there's enough crude to fully fuel fuel the United States economy are you ready
[02:40:33.440 --> 02:40:40.240]  through the year 2041 straight from our own soil and that's what's already
[02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:45.640]  that's what's already discovered and on tap now yes that is right there they
[02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:50.880]  know it's there's even more ready to tap it now here's the next field they're
[02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:56.720]  going to open it's called the Standberry Standberry and you'll find it in the
[02:40:56.720 --> 02:41:04.840]  Standberry report which was issued on April the 20th of 2006 here's the report
[02:41:04.840 --> 02:41:11.240]  on it hidden 1,000 feet beneath the surface of the Rocky Mountains lies the
[02:41:11.240 --> 02:41:17.840]  largest untapped oil reserve in the world it is more than 2 trillion barrels
[02:41:17.840 --> 02:41:22.960]  here's the report of how much you have there this report is stunning and
[02:41:22.960 --> 02:41:27.640]  they're going to open this field up when they get it to $200 a barrel we have
[02:41:27.640 --> 02:41:33.440]  more oil inside our borders than all other proven reserves on earth here they
[02:41:33.440 --> 02:41:38.640]  are eight times more oil than Saudi Arabia 18 times more oil than Iraq 21
[02:41:38.640 --> 02:41:44.840]  times more oil than Q8 22 times as much oil as Iran 500 times as much oil as
[02:41:44.840 --> 02:41:52.800]  Yemen and it's all right here on our own soil James Partis one of the lead
[02:41:52.800 --> 02:41:58.480]  researchers with in the study of how much oil we have he went on to say we
[02:41:58.480 --> 02:42:04.600]  have more than 2 trillion barrels untapped more than all the proven oil
[02:42:04.600 --> 02:42:10.240]  reserves of crude oil in the world and this was written in the Denver Post now
[02:42:10.240 --> 02:42:13.480]  they know it's there I'll give you the other two places they're going to open
[02:42:13.480 --> 02:42:18.320]  up they will open up Gaul Island in Alaska I was my book energy nine
[02:42:18.320 --> 02:42:22.920]  crisis the only place on the face of the earth that statistics and details are
[02:42:22.920 --> 02:42:28.680]  given on this secondly of course I'm sorry the fourth area will be the Arctic
[02:42:28.680 --> 02:42:33.320]  Wildlife Refuge and whenever they open that now you say we can't do that
[02:42:33.320 --> 02:42:37.920]  because the ecologists won't let us oh yes you will by the time the ecologists
[02:42:37.920 --> 02:42:41.120]  don't have any food on that table along with you not having food on your
[02:42:41.120 --> 02:42:45.480]  table the dollar has collapsed and the whole economy is in shambles of the
[02:42:45.480 --> 02:42:49.680]  Federal Reserve that basically become a disgrace and the Arabs have been
[02:42:49.680 --> 02:42:55.240]  swindled and stripped out of all the money that they spent on TV old some
[02:42:55.240 --> 02:42:59.520]  Federal Reserve notes all of these years at that point the economy being such a
[02:42:59.520 --> 02:43:04.520]  condition even any colleges and a green piece here will be begging for these oil
[02:43:04.520 --> 02:43:08.720]  fields to be produced and this is what I was given the other day by one of the
[02:43:08.720 --> 02:43:14.440]  elite and the entire story of what their plans are you watch it unfold more and
[02:43:14.440 --> 02:43:18.160]  more disruption in the Middle East all across America you're going to see
[02:43:18.160 --> 02:43:25.080]  problems this is coming to America it's not just a broad yes I've got I've got
[02:43:25.080 --> 02:43:29.000]  two quick questions and then I want to go to the calls as we promised and we'll
[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.680]  obviously have to have you back up but you were telling me that whenever you
[02:43:31.680 --> 02:43:34.880]  come on my show it's like none other that you've been contacted by hundreds of
[02:43:34.880 --> 02:43:40.720]  other radio hosts in the last day Alex I think every radio talk show hosted
[02:43:40.720 --> 02:43:44.880]  America listen to your show and I'm not going to go a little bit further I have
[02:43:44.880 --> 02:43:49.880]  not been contacted by Fox News or any of the liberal media but I think the
[02:43:49.880 --> 02:43:54.520]  liberal media is listening to your show every single day yesterday I couldn't
[02:43:54.520 --> 02:43:58.880]  get away from my phone finally last night when it got dark it quit ringing I
[02:43:58.880 --> 02:44:01.960]  think every talk show host in the country is saying oh my gracious you
[02:44:01.960 --> 02:44:05.960]  appeared on Alex Jones show we want your knowledge to folks listen to what Alex
[02:44:05.960 --> 02:44:09.520]  Jones says he's been listening to by the whole nation because they know he's
[02:44:09.520 --> 02:44:13.400]  telling the truth well I wasn't even trying to tune my horn I just wanted to
[02:44:13.400 --> 02:44:16.000]  point out that this is getting a lot of attention and that's certainly positive
[02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:19.680]  but it causes a catch-22 it'll be hard to get you back on we need to probably
[02:44:19.680 --> 02:44:23.720]  pick an hour out next week have you come back again because there's so much you
[02:44:23.720 --> 02:44:26.920]  haven't even gotten to Ken from and the speech he gave me a little exact
[02:44:26.920 --> 02:44:31.360]  story of Gaul Island I still haven't given what Ken from told me that day I
[02:44:31.360 --> 02:44:35.080]  still haven't told you how he was fired from Atlantic Ridgefield and then hired
[02:44:35.080 --> 02:44:39.320]  back I haven't given the details of much of the most slope of Alaska I mean
[02:44:39.320 --> 02:44:44.520]  this goes so deep but yes let's go on where we want every direction you like
[02:44:44.520 --> 02:44:49.200]  just very bravely because I promise that one thing yeah right now right this
[02:44:49.200 --> 02:44:54.920]  second while this program is going on Providence Rhode Island the the city of
[02:44:54.920 --> 02:44:59.320]  Providence is $40 million in deficit right this second
[02:44:59.320 --> 02:45:03.960]  letters have been set out this morning to every school teacher in Providence
[02:45:03.960 --> 02:45:08.560]  Rhode Island saying they're dismissed did you hear that this morning right now
[02:45:08.560 --> 02:45:12.520]  all this program going on got it just before the program this morning every
[02:45:12.520 --> 02:45:15.400]  school teacher in Providence Rhode Island is sent a lot of saying they
[02:45:15.400 --> 02:45:19.440]  dismissed and if they try to do what they did in Wisconsin they plan to
[02:45:19.440 --> 02:45:25.400]  dismiss them or the cost of schools and this is going folks this is going to
[02:45:25.400 --> 02:45:28.640]  spread all over America exactly what happened in the Middle East until the
[02:45:28.640 --> 02:45:32.920]  elite accomplish what they want in bringing in the new world yeah there's
[02:45:32.920 --> 02:45:36.440]  the there's the article out of Providence and what's the source on that
[02:45:36.440 --> 02:45:45.200]  jaren you scroll down that's out of the projo.com that's the Providence
[02:45:45.200 --> 02:45:48.520]  Journal okay got it thank you can't read it across the room I need to put a
[02:45:48.520 --> 02:45:51.600]  bigger TV there I got good eyes a little bit monitor over there I'm gonna read
[02:45:51.600 --> 02:45:57.560]  from here thank you guys brotherhood is chatting we have the video sound bite of
[02:45:57.560 --> 02:46:03.680]  this go to Israel and kill the Jews folks this is going and this is a
[02:46:03.680 --> 02:46:08.240]  revolution funded by the federal government so they don't just destabilize
[02:46:08.240 --> 02:46:12.200]  the place this is so the globalists have an excuse to blow the daylights out of
[02:46:12.200 --> 02:46:20.120]  the extremists when they get in power yes exactly and they every go to this
[02:46:20.120 --> 02:46:25.520]  a plan I told I gave this four months ago on Alex Jones show that this Middle
[02:46:25.520 --> 02:46:29.240]  East crisis was going to develop Lindsay you did we've got to go to calls and
[02:46:29.240 --> 02:46:31.880]  I've got to bring up these points and then it's a catch 22 because people want
[02:46:31.880 --> 02:46:34.680]  to hear you but then callers want to get on and then I've got to have my
[02:46:34.680 --> 02:46:38.200]  questions here but let's check the schedule Lindsay before your whole
[02:46:38.200 --> 02:46:42.480]  calendar gets filled when did you come on next week for an hour Alex for you
[02:46:42.480 --> 02:46:49.480]  I'll come on anytime jaren what about Wednesday at 12 30 what do we got on the
[02:46:49.480 --> 02:46:54.240]  board there let's just get this going right now because obviously because I've
[02:46:54.240 --> 02:46:57.280]  talked to Lindsay off here and he's got so much more information I guess I could
[02:46:57.280 --> 02:47:00.280]  just not take the calls but I promise to here's other two points here's
[02:47:00.280 --> 02:47:06.000]  Bloomberg sustained oil price gain may cause us recession lay he says that's
[02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:09.280]  Bloomberg we never left the recession lay and you know it so they're going to
[02:47:09.280 --> 02:47:12.480]  blame all this Arab stuff you see on the Depression and Lindsay said that four
[02:47:12.480 --> 02:47:18.520]  months ago here's another one where's my other report I had one about T bills not
[02:47:18.520 --> 02:47:21.720]  being bought here it is what just what you were saying earlier market watch
[02:47:21.720 --> 02:47:28.800]  that just out literally 30 minutes ago Treasury gives up gains after five year
[02:47:28.800 --> 02:47:32.520]  auction and it goes on to report a massive number of the US Treasuries
[02:47:32.520 --> 02:47:36.880]  were not bought and will be monetized by the Federal Reserve so that's more
[02:47:36.880 --> 02:47:40.720]  printing of money I mean this thing is unraveling fast Lindsay are you sure that
[02:47:40.720 --> 02:47:43.880]  people like Stan Porter Stansbury aren't right and it could happen at the
[02:47:43.880 --> 02:47:46.880]  end of this year early next year I mean are you sure your elitist friends right
[02:47:46.880 --> 02:47:51.720]  that it's total implosion by the end of 2012 I hope my elitist friends are
[02:47:51.720 --> 02:47:56.120]  correct and it's the end of 2012 but I wouldn't bet on it the way that you're
[02:47:56.120 --> 02:48:02.040]  seeing things happen they may have they may have advanced their timeline I have
[02:48:02.040 --> 02:48:06.200]  not been told that but I'll say one thing folks you must get ready right now
[02:48:06.200 --> 02:48:09.880]  you've got to make preparation you need to get food in the house you need to get
[02:48:09.880 --> 02:48:13.880]  out of paper if it's if it's written on papers worth the paper it's written on
[02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:17.560]  you need to make preparations right now even though I have been told by the end
[02:48:17.560 --> 02:48:21.120]  of 2012 don't wait that long well if there was a 10% chance we were gonna
[02:48:21.120 --> 02:48:24.920]  have Weimar style inflation I would get ready and I have and I did you know
[02:48:24.920 --> 02:48:29.720]  years ago because of this I mean I've moved to the country I got a well I'm
[02:48:29.720 --> 02:48:34.240]  going on solar and I'm getting ready I mean folks we're freaked out I believe
[02:48:34.240 --> 02:48:38.280]  everything I'm saying and and but let's just hope by the providence of God as
[02:48:38.280 --> 02:48:43.840]  as Lindsay says as chaplain William says that we can fix this we're gonna skip
[02:48:43.840 --> 02:48:46.920]  this break so I get to all the calls network break station shouldn't play
[02:48:46.920 --> 02:48:54.080]  over this but whatever I'm just speechless at this point and it just
[02:48:54.080 --> 02:48:58.080]  makes me sick my last question we're going to calls for you Lindsay in your
[02:48:58.080 --> 02:49:03.920]  discussions with Mr. L the living CEO with him did he say anything about
[02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:08.000]  Russia are they playing ball with the globalist or is there real division
[02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.680]  there because we know that the globalist have been angry that they're
[02:49:10.680 --> 02:49:15.560]  producing so much oil and gas on record has that helped keep prices down I mean
[02:49:15.560 --> 02:49:20.640]  is Russia playing ball and all this what's going on I really don't know
[02:49:20.640 --> 02:49:25.440]  exactly the inner workings of Russia all I know that I was told to watch China
[02:49:25.440 --> 02:49:30.000]  it's the big one and China and Russia are the ones that we need to keep our eyes
[02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:34.200]  on it because of the agreement that Russia made with China in supplying it
[02:49:34.200 --> 02:49:37.560]  with all of their crude oil that means that whatever the Middle East stop
[02:49:37.560 --> 02:49:42.280]  supplying it to us we will not get it from Russia right now we're still getting
[02:49:42.280 --> 02:49:46.280]  some oil from Russia very little but we'll be getting even less than because
[02:49:46.280 --> 02:49:52.040]  they're going to supply for China that leaves you know they've announced they're going to sell less to Europe and natural gas
[02:49:52.040 --> 02:49:56.800]  just it's going to China and themselves I mean this is a recipe for massive price
[02:49:56.800 --> 02:50:01.080]  increases on top of dollar devaluation very interesting this natural gas
[02:50:01.080 --> 02:50:07.040]  supplied to Europe by Russia this is drastic because they get cold winters
[02:50:07.040 --> 02:50:12.800]  over there and now when I when Gaddafi cuts off all the oil to Europe in
[02:50:12.800 --> 02:50:16.960]  Gaddafi's oil they can come to America and mainly goes to Italy Europe mainly
[02:50:16.960 --> 02:50:21.920]  goes to Italy yeah yeah most of it Italy can you imagine 1.6 million barrels
[02:50:21.920 --> 02:50:25.400]  being cut off tomorrow morning if they oust Gaddafi and he blows up their oil
[02:50:25.400 --> 02:50:29.680]  wells it's already being slowed it just gets crazier by the minute many idea
[02:50:29.680 --> 02:50:34.080]  speaking of Russia was in the AP yesterday saying that I guess we're not
[02:50:34.080 --> 02:50:38.840]  going to skip this break yeah let's kill this break John yeah I'm gonna kill that
[02:50:38.840 --> 02:50:43.000]  break network break this is so important but I mean there's many idea of saying
[02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:47.000]  this could go on for decades in the Middle East oh yeah this is just the
[02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:51.280]  beginning what you saw in Egypt is all of the tip of the iceberg now of course
[02:50:51.280 --> 02:50:55.240]  it's about spread to live in Libya and the other countries over there are
[02:50:55.240 --> 02:51:00.440]  scared to death and we're all fifth of six feet I guess it is which guards the
[02:51:00.440 --> 02:51:07.120]  trade of our moves in that area and Iran all it close to that this whole thing
[02:51:07.120 --> 02:51:11.800]  it isn't up evil all right let's jam in some calls for this in the next five
[02:51:11.800 --> 02:51:14.760]  minutes segment then Corbett's join us for two we shortened him today we'll be
[02:51:14.760 --> 02:51:19.000]  back with us for a full hour joining us from Japan in the near future let's go
[02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:23.360]  ahead and go to Ryan in New York around the year thanks for holding hey Alex
[02:51:23.360 --> 02:51:26.720]  how you doing I guess all right I mean at least we know what's going on but I
[02:51:26.720 --> 02:51:32.640]  don't like it doing a great job I love the show all right my question for
[02:51:32.640 --> 02:51:37.880]  Lindsay what were your thoughts or any chatter from your contacts on the
[02:51:37.880 --> 02:51:43.680]  Israeli oil it's Stan Johnson talks about and how that might play into the
[02:51:43.680 --> 02:51:49.680]  overall mid-east larger picture or is that still a wild card and I'll take my
[02:51:49.680 --> 02:51:52.960]  answer off the air thanks yeah there's oil everywhere else over there why not
[02:51:52.960 --> 02:51:59.000]  in Israel I think there is oil in Israel
[02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:07.160]  absolutely so he's asking if you heard anything about that I have not but I
[02:52:07.160 --> 02:52:11.840]  suspect since it's so close to all the other countries that have it I suspect
[02:52:11.840 --> 02:52:15.240]  that Israel probably already knows this there well in Israel follows the Anglo
[02:52:15.240 --> 02:52:19.920]  American system Empire model so if we've not been using our oil I would guess
[02:52:19.920 --> 02:52:24.120]  they would keep it as a strategic backup as well makes sense Charlie in North
[02:52:24.120 --> 02:52:30.640]  Carolina Charlie you're on the air hey guys how you doing good welcome thank
[02:52:30.640 --> 02:52:36.520]  you sir question I have two questions my first question is in regards to Mexico
[02:52:36.520 --> 02:52:42.520]  and I said Mexico is just going crazy right now and I'm wondering if that ties
[02:52:42.520 --> 02:52:46.080]  in with any other stuff that's going on in the Middle East or if that's a soda
[02:52:46.080 --> 02:52:50.080]  totally separate well the Middle East will exacerbate the people live in
[02:52:50.080 --> 02:52:55.400]  tyranny in Mexico and in government induced squalor Lindsey what's your
[02:52:55.400 --> 02:53:00.000]  take on that by the way I can't hear your callers so you'll have to repeat the
[02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:04.000]  question to me Alex oh I'm sorry Lindsey he's asking how Mexico and the riots
[02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:08.080]  down there playing to this oh it'll play into it perfectly I think the entire
[02:53:08.080 --> 02:53:12.280]  drug cocktail down there they're just using it as an excuse because Mexico has
[02:53:12.280 --> 02:53:16.880]  so much oil and they want disruption everywhere then I want it Middle East they
[02:53:16.880 --> 02:53:20.640]  wanted to cross America with our school teachers they want every kind of civil
[02:53:20.640 --> 02:53:24.080]  unrest that they can get because this helps them to bring on that new world
[02:53:24.080 --> 02:53:29.240]  order so yes that's just one little tip of it all in Mexico notice it's all
[02:53:29.240 --> 02:53:33.320]  happening at once because the World Reserve currency the dollar is dying
[02:53:33.320 --> 02:53:37.480]  and it's again it's moving quicker and so the globalist have been prepared for
[02:53:37.480 --> 02:53:42.800]  this getting I mean I had an article out of the Ottawa news today dealing with
[02:53:42.800 --> 02:53:47.040]  the foreign troops to be used in the US and Canada I mean they're getting
[02:53:47.040 --> 02:53:51.280]  everybody ready Lindsey yeah I run people three years ago Alex you knew I
[02:53:51.280 --> 02:53:57.000]  know I produced six DVDs two and a half years ago and I warned people that I had
[02:53:57.000 --> 02:54:00.640]  been told all this was coming but people wouldn't believe then go out and get
[02:54:00.640 --> 02:54:04.520]  food and take care of things but yes they have been planning this for years in
[02:54:04.520 --> 02:54:08.280]  fact I want to show people the article of their new listeners it's Canada US
[02:54:08.280 --> 02:54:12.760]  agree to use each other's troops and civil emergencies and it goes on civil
[02:54:12.760 --> 02:54:16.680]  unrest the US Northern Command is basically under its continental security
[02:54:16.680 --> 02:54:22.280]  perimeter under General Reinhardt taking over Mexico and Canada the North
[02:54:22.280 --> 02:54:29.240]  American Army is now official this out of the Ottawa citizen they're getting
[02:54:29.240 --> 02:54:33.880]  ready for World War three folks in fact what if what if from and Mr. L have to
[02:54:33.880 --> 02:54:39.320]  say about war in the cards Lindsey nothing except the Middle East I was
[02:54:39.320 --> 02:54:42.920]  told that five months in advance there was going to be a conflict over there
[02:54:42.920 --> 02:54:46.680]  I was not told what nation it would be and we know now that it's Egypt and that
[02:54:46.680 --> 02:54:49.880]  was just the beginning I think the reason they didn't tell me where is it
[02:54:49.880 --> 02:54:53.320]  because they could have picked any one of those nations over there to start the
[02:54:53.320 --> 02:54:56.920]  conflict and that'll spread everywhere but Egypt's the key it's the biggest okay
[02:54:56.920 --> 02:55:01.080]  population-wise one of the more wealthy compared to the others let's talk to
[02:55:01.080 --> 02:55:05.400]  Bill and Connecticut Bill you're on the air with Lindsey Williams yes hi Alex
[02:55:05.400 --> 02:55:09.280]  hey you know I'm just I'm just wondering and you had briefly touched on this the
[02:55:09.280 --> 02:55:14.120]  other day is you know since we are the government we the people why are we
[02:55:14.120 --> 02:55:17.680]  standing for this why don't we just round these people up and try them for
[02:55:17.680 --> 02:55:20.840]  trees well I'm doing my best to get people to take the states back through
[02:55:20.840 --> 02:55:25.200]  the 10th and 9th Amendment and to educate people as Thomas Jefferson said
[02:55:25.200 --> 02:55:29.800]  educate the people in liberty and history and corruption will van them like you
[02:55:29.800 --> 02:55:35.000]  know phantom mist in the morning and so I'm here doing the best I can I mean I
[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:38.960]  can only cover the information I've been arrested protesting I get death threats
[02:55:38.960 --> 02:55:46.000]  I'm doing it but pretty much the most I can I mean I'm 110% and I you know I
[02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:50.120]  appreciate all you're doing but it just seems like everyone all of us are
[02:55:50.120 --> 02:55:54.760]  talking about this like it's all a foregone conclusion when you know you
[02:55:54.760 --> 02:56:00.000]  look at what day that I talks about the pyramid there's just a few at the top of
[02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:03.200]  this I know but but still a lot of people are waking up but still the
[02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:07.720]  majority are only care about Justin Bieber and Hollywood and things now if we
[02:56:07.720 --> 02:56:11.480]  could get big Hollywood people to come out on this we could use the globalist
[02:56:11.480 --> 02:56:14.920]  propaganda channel to backfire that's very close to happening but they're
[02:56:14.920 --> 02:56:19.920]  threatened they're scared but if people stop worrying about Justin Bieber and
[02:56:19.920 --> 02:56:26.000]  Lady Gaga I mean the general public is in a trance they've given themselves over
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:30.440]  to delusion Lindsey Williams comments they will be that way on till it's too
[02:56:30.440 --> 02:56:34.160]  late when they've finally gotten to the place that the grocery store prices are
[02:56:34.160 --> 02:56:38.560]  doubled and tripled and quadrupled the dollar begins to collapse you paying
[02:56:38.560 --> 02:56:43.040]  seven and eight dollars a gallon at the gas pump by that time they will basically
[02:56:43.040 --> 02:56:46.200]  have the population where they want them right now there's still time to do
[02:56:46.200 --> 02:56:50.040]  something about it is because of programs like yours Alex and you've got a
[02:56:50.040 --> 02:56:54.200]  listening audience it is for an armado believe me I've never seen the like of
[02:56:54.200 --> 02:56:57.960]  what happened as a result of yesterday's program and in the next little short
[02:56:57.960 --> 02:57:01.520]  seven we're gonna give out the number and website of folks want to preorder the
[02:57:01.520 --> 02:57:04.280]  production that's coming out in the next few weeks to the Middle East the rest of
[02:57:04.280 --> 02:57:10.520]  story Lindsey Williams was that bill we were talking to okay Bob in Texas you're
[02:57:10.520 --> 02:57:15.800]  on the air with Lindsey Williams you got a great show appreciate everything you
[02:57:15.800 --> 02:57:20.280]  do and I worked in Prudhoe Bay for many years and was out on Gulf Island doing
[02:57:20.280 --> 02:57:25.320]  test wheels and over close to the National Wildlife Refugee was told to I
[02:57:25.320 --> 02:57:30.200]  had to sign documents disclosure documents you know you were never here
[02:57:30.200 --> 02:57:35.200]  you don't know anything about it my question to Lindsey is do you really
[02:57:35.200 --> 02:57:39.600]  think that the Saudis and the Middle East are gonna cut the oil off completely
[02:57:39.600 --> 02:57:44.640]  to us because that sustains their way of life that supplies money to their wall
[02:57:44.640 --> 02:57:47.480]  what he's saying is it's going to be disrupted and because of dollar
[02:57:47.480 --> 02:57:51.680]  devaluation it's going to cost so much it's prohibitive so that will put
[02:57:51.680 --> 02:57:55.360]  pressure causing development that I mean that's a simplification Lindsey when
[02:57:55.360 --> 02:57:59.520]  you say they're gonna completely cut it off right well when the civil unrest gets
[02:57:59.520 --> 02:58:04.960]  so drastic in places like Saudi Arabia United Arab Emirates other places
[02:58:04.960 --> 02:58:08.680]  every place that produces oil over that one the king just handed out tens of
[02:58:08.680 --> 02:58:15.080]  billions of dollars to stop unrest today in Saudi yeah and they once once this
[02:58:15.080 --> 02:58:19.320]  gets to that point and they blow up oil wells they blow up
[02:58:19.320 --> 02:58:23.720]  transmission lines all the rest they won't be able to produce it like they're
[02:58:23.720 --> 02:58:27.200]  doing it right now by the way we won't get it let me just throw this in before
[02:58:27.200 --> 02:58:31.960]  we got a break this is so important well we'll just come back with a point on
[02:58:31.960 --> 02:58:34.640]  the other side because I forgot it that's why I interrupt cuz I want to get
[02:58:34.640 --> 02:58:38.840]  that point in there was super important yeah the king left France from his
[02:58:38.840 --> 02:58:50.400]  treasured pleasure palace back he's so worried thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live.com today

[03:01:32.320 --> 03:01:36.760]  they have created the unrest and the crisis they want in the Middle East and
[03:01:36.760 --> 03:01:41.800]  other oil producing countries let's jam in a few final calls sec in Missouri and
[03:01:41.800 --> 03:01:46.640]  then miles in Hawaii go ahead sec good day at it at John's my question is
[03:01:46.640 --> 03:01:51.960]  will you believe I was curious if his source ever spoke to him about the
[03:01:51.960 --> 03:01:56.520]  containment grid and the contingency grid when they are going to raise the gas
[03:01:56.520 --> 03:02:03.600]  prices the containment grid and the contingency grid on gas prices Lindsay
[03:02:03.600 --> 03:02:09.720]  oh well the gas prices of course are going to go up up up and I'm not quite
[03:02:09.720 --> 03:02:13.160]  understanding his question are you talking about price controls what do you
[03:02:13.160 --> 03:02:19.760]  educate us what you're talking about sec host cities and then derivative cities
[03:02:19.760 --> 03:02:24.080]  and sister cities does he have any idea from his sources how they're going to
[03:02:24.080 --> 03:02:29.200]  spread this across the United States are you talking about lockdowns of cities
[03:02:29.200 --> 03:02:33.920]  well no I'm talking about the gas price structure on for instance you know they
[03:02:33.920 --> 03:02:37.960]  test market a lot of their ideas in certain areas of New York places like
[03:02:37.960 --> 03:02:41.400]  Ithaca and then they roll them out into other cities are they going to do
[03:02:41.400 --> 03:02:45.600]  something like this are you going to have a host city when the oil crisis hits
[03:02:45.600 --> 03:02:49.960]  and then spread it out into the other cities around the United States Lindsay
[03:02:49.960 --> 03:02:54.120]  I don't think you'd be any safer in one part of the country than you are another
[03:02:54.120 --> 03:03:00.600]  I have not heard that they're going to do it one city at a time I believe that
[03:03:00.600 --> 03:03:04.080]  whenever this crisis gets so great in the Middle East and they can't supply the
[03:03:04.080 --> 03:03:08.040]  oil you know now at that point they'll just raise the price everywhere yes sec
[03:03:08.040 --> 03:03:12.720]  thank you we're almost out of time the way oil works folks is that they increase
[03:03:12.720 --> 03:03:15.960]  the prices when they have a glut by buying up refineries and shutting them
[03:03:15.960 --> 03:03:19.960]  down or cutting production that came out in AP lawsuit to get the documents on
[03:03:19.960 --> 03:03:26.240]  the big five oil companies 2001 for their meetings in 95 the reason you pay more
[03:03:26.240 --> 03:03:30.600]  in place like New York or a place like LA is because there's harder
[03:03:30.600 --> 03:03:35.000]  transportation to bring it in plus the real estate cost or more so the gas
[03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:38.920]  stations cost more to operate that's the main reason you see big increases in
[03:03:38.920 --> 03:03:42.360]  certain areas compared to others like if you're in South Texas right next to the
[03:03:42.360 --> 03:03:45.600]  oil refinery you're gonna be paying the lowest prices in the country correct
[03:03:45.600 --> 03:03:49.760]  Lindsay yes and the reason you see it in California for instance is because of
[03:03:49.760 --> 03:03:54.120]  California law that states that they must have the fuel refined to a certain
[03:03:54.120 --> 03:03:57.840]  state yes and all those additives and with the diesel fuel they can't allow
[03:03:57.840 --> 03:04:02.280]  any of the contamination this is state law that required yes price so much
[03:04:02.280 --> 03:04:06.000]  higher in California we got one minute left real quick comment or question for
[03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:10.800]  Miles in Hawaii hello ha go ahead hello ha Pastor Lindsay and Alex on a
[03:04:10.800 --> 03:04:14.960]  spiritual basis I just want to we're dealing with principalities of darkness
[03:04:14.960 --> 03:04:19.920]  besides the physical men at the power elite level and I just wanted to ask can
[03:04:19.920 --> 03:04:26.040]  we get like momentum for prayer cover for everybody yes we should pray that
[03:04:26.040 --> 03:04:29.960]  this nation the world repent as the Bible says seek God's face and repent and

[03:04:36.600 --> 03:04:41.120]  after the allocations show the annual room and tell Jesus Christ you won't

[03:04:46.160 --> 03:04:48.840]  discernment the blessings and everything that comes with it what I think this
[03:04:48.840 --> 03:04:53.200]  country's been so blessed we're not perfect but we were good Christian
[03:04:53.200 --> 03:04:56.960]  Puritan nation Lindsay we'll see you back next Tuesday right in the middle of
[03:04:56.960 --> 03:05:02.880]  the show God bless you talk to you again soon there's a man named Dr. Wallach who
[03:05:02.880 --> 03:05:06.480]  is anything but your typical doctor both a veterinary and a naturopathic
[03:05:06.480 --> 03:05:11.120]  physician doc asks why does the United States spend more money on health care
[03:05:11.120 --> 03:05:16.080]  by far and still rank 50th in health and longevity worldwide he believes that
[03:05:16.080 --> 03:05:19.840]  people should empower themselves with a basic understanding of nutrition
[03:05:19.840 --> 03:05:24.120]  taking charge of their life and attain optimal health and longevity through
[03:05:24.120 --> 03:05:28.640]  nutrition not by toxic prescription drugs leading to side effects this is
[03:05:28.640 --> 03:05:33.120]  clearly a deadly recipe the good news is doc wallach's message is resonating with
[03:05:33.120 --> 03:05:36.800]  an increasing number of Americans who are waking up to all the big government
[03:05:36.800 --> 03:05:40.960]  big pharma manipulation of our health care system I like what doc wallach is
[03:05:40.960 --> 03:05:44.880]  saying and doing to enlighten people about health care and have joined forces
[03:05:44.880 --> 03:05:49.280]  to help this tireless crusader spread his message visit info wars team dot com
[03:05:49.280 --> 03:05:53.560]  and listen to dr. wallach's deadly recipes lecture it makes a lot of sense

[03:06:17.680 --> 03:06:22.240]  possibilities it means all the world under their control the United Nations
[03:06:22.240 --> 03:06:26.400]  would take over America the tri-lateral Commission would control the world
[03:06:26.400 --> 03:06:30.880]  invisible empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in
[03:06:30.880 --> 03:06:35.200]  stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government I believe
[03:06:35.200 --> 03:06:39.040]  first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the
[03:06:39.040 --> 03:06:43.240]  global financial system global governance with the establishment of a G20 so
[03:06:43.240 --> 03:06:47.520]  it's gonna be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else and I got news for

[03:08:13.560 --> 03:08:18.960]  the Corbett report on from Japan and he's been over there since 2004 working
[03:08:18.960 --> 03:08:25.800]  there to get has international perspective and since 2007 he has been
[03:08:25.800 --> 03:08:30.680]  producing great little five minute ten minute fifteen minute video news reports
[03:08:30.680 --> 03:08:35.240]  that I just find to be very well researched and covering the carbon
[03:08:35.240 --> 03:08:39.840]  taxes eugenics geopolitical developments and I wanted to get James Corbett up
[03:08:39.840 --> 03:08:44.840]  with us from Japan Corbett report commas his websites he's got a
[03:08:44.840 --> 03:08:50.360]  forthcoming book reportage essays on the New World Order and so that should be
[03:08:50.360 --> 03:08:54.520]  available very very soon it says in early 2011 so maybe it's available now but
[03:08:54.520 --> 03:09:00.320]  James it's crazy times to have you on so much of what people been talking about
[03:09:00.320 --> 03:09:03.760]  for 50 years with the development of the world government mainly insiders who
[03:09:03.760 --> 03:09:06.840]  were in the military at high level with the been Congress that came out and
[03:09:06.840 --> 03:09:10.520]  warned people when they were briefed on this 50-year plan that we're now coming
[03:09:10.520 --> 03:09:15.360]  to the end of this phase and the next 50-year extermination program folks
[03:09:15.360 --> 03:09:19.760]  enjoy that they don't listen but there's so much to talk about I didn't do any
[03:09:19.760 --> 03:09:22.640]  pre-interview with you it's good to have you here what do you think's most
[03:09:22.640 --> 03:09:26.800]  important going on in the world right now what's on your radar screen well it
[03:09:26.800 --> 03:09:30.520]  is difficult to say because as you say these are insanely crazy times and
[03:09:30.520 --> 03:09:34.320]  there's so much going on right now but obviously what's happening in the
[03:09:34.320 --> 03:09:36.880]  Middle East and everything that Lindsay Williams was just covering is
[03:09:36.880 --> 03:09:41.680]  absolutely vital the central to what's going on and the ongoing economic
[03:09:41.680 --> 03:09:45.360]  collapse is something that I'm always concerned with but I guess other than
[03:09:45.360 --> 03:09:49.160]  that the overlay of the eugenics scientific control grid is something
[03:09:49.160 --> 03:09:52.840]  that I tend to concentrate on because that's I mean that's really the heart
[03:09:52.840 --> 03:09:58.360]  of what drives the New World Order into eugenics obsessed elite so so again
[03:09:58.360 --> 03:10:01.520]  there's so much going on but I think something that's important to stress is
[03:10:01.520 --> 03:10:05.120]  that you I mean you're so right that people have been warning about this for
[03:10:05.120 --> 03:10:11.360]  50 years but we in our generation are so incredibly fortunate to be living in
[03:10:11.360 --> 03:10:15.600]  this age where we literally have the library of Alexandria at our fingertips
[03:10:15.600 --> 03:10:19.400]  with this new internet technology that that has opened up this world of
[03:10:19.400 --> 03:10:24.680]  information and has made us probably the most energized and the most the
[03:10:24.680 --> 03:10:28.960]  greatest potential of any generation ever to really to really nail the the
[03:10:28.960 --> 03:10:31.960]  wooden stake through the heart of this New World Order so that's what I'm
[03:10:31.960 --> 03:10:35.400]  attempting to do with my work and I know you are with yours and I'm just not
[03:10:35.400 --> 03:10:39.400]  taking it for granted this incredible opportunity we have right now well James
[03:10:39.400 --> 03:10:44.920]  you know the double-edged double meaning Chinese saying of may you live in
[03:10:44.920 --> 03:10:50.440]  interesting times is the glass half empty or half full the point is human
[03:10:50.440 --> 03:10:55.560]  destiny for our entire future is now being decided revolutions in robotics
[03:10:55.560 --> 03:11:03.400]  genetic engineering weapons systems transportation information it's kind of
[03:11:03.400 --> 03:11:07.400]  like starving children many times in third-world countries are loving they're
[03:11:07.400 --> 03:11:11.280]  thankful they're well-behaved but then spoiled children that have all the food
[03:11:11.280 --> 03:11:14.920]  they could eat in the world don't want healthy food they want junk and become
[03:11:14.920 --> 03:11:19.400]  spoiled brats so there aren't some people waking up and getting involved in
[03:11:19.400 --> 03:11:23.640]  using all this information to spread knowledge in a new renaissance a new
[03:11:23.640 --> 03:11:27.440]  awakening enlightenment but at the same time you've got people who are
[03:11:27.440 --> 03:11:32.200]  awakening and becoming better but others falling to the brainwashing the
[03:11:32.200 --> 03:11:37.000]  sodium fluoride the TV flicker screens the system and the globalists are
[03:11:37.000 --> 03:11:41.920]  turning up their heat with their full-on assault of the environment of
[03:11:41.920 --> 03:11:45.960]  humanity to literally weaken us and we have all their white papers that you so
[03:11:45.960 --> 03:11:50.920]  well documented some of your short films that really illustrate that let's
[03:11:50.920 --> 03:11:54.280]  talk about the onslaught of the globalist against the people so they from
[03:11:54.280 --> 03:11:58.440]  your own research what you think is most important on that front well
[03:11:58.440 --> 03:12:02.560]  unfortunately you're right there aren't there aren't enough people yet that are
[03:12:02.560 --> 03:12:06.400]  really energized and tuned into this real political reality but there are more
[03:12:06.400 --> 03:12:10.120]  waking up every day as you well know and as I see on my work as well I mean I
[03:12:10.120 --> 03:12:14.480]  see so many more people who are now at this point especially as things increase
[03:12:14.480 --> 03:12:18.000]  and as the temperature rises people are more and more interested in getting into
[03:12:18.000 --> 03:12:21.200]  this information so so that's why it's important that we're out there spreading
[03:12:21.200 --> 03:12:25.400]  this information right now but I think unfortunately the vast majority of the
[03:12:25.400 --> 03:12:30.200]  public has been intellectually crippled by the fact that the media has been
[03:12:30.200 --> 03:12:35.800]  completely and utterly controlled for decades now at least by the big
[03:12:35.800 --> 03:12:39.360]  foundations for example I mean you have a report up on Info Wars today about the
[03:12:39.360 --> 03:12:43.280]  Gates Foundation and how they've been influencing media coverage of the Gates
[03:12:43.280 --> 03:12:46.800]  Foundation surprise surprise and of course we saw that going back with the
[03:12:46.800 --> 03:12:50.880]  Rockefellers and all of that before that and then the education system itself as
[03:12:50.880 --> 03:12:56.000]  as many of your guests have talked about before obviously has been used to dumb
[03:12:56.000 --> 03:13:00.360]  people down so I mean in a sense the public has been intellectually crippled
[03:13:00.360 --> 03:13:04.240]  by their their lack of information about what the real political paradigm is and
[03:13:04.240 --> 03:13:09.160]  who the real political players are and and sometimes I mean the the tendency is
[03:13:09.160 --> 03:13:12.720]  for some people to blame the public for being intellectually crippled but I don't
[03:13:12.720 --> 03:13:17.480]  think that's that's particularly helpful I mean we just have to do our best to
[03:13:17.480 --> 03:13:21.320]  try to overcome that and and and now that we have this internet technology we
[03:13:21.320 --> 03:13:25.360]  really do have the chance at at waking more people up to this so it is kind of
[03:13:25.360 --> 03:13:30.080]  a race I think it's just a question of whether we're running fast enough well
[03:13:30.080 --> 03:13:34.160]  that's well said and again of course when I give my little parables or my
[03:13:34.160 --> 03:13:38.320]  allegories I a lot of times don't finish them my point is children who don't have
[03:13:38.320 --> 03:13:42.720]  enough to eat are thankful or appreciative their eyes shine with life I
[03:13:42.720 --> 03:13:45.600]  mean this has been well documented by historians and then people that have
[03:13:45.600 --> 03:13:54.520]  plenty what was the saying by the French philosopher Victor Hugo that adversity
[03:13:54.520 --> 03:13:59.880]  makes men prosperity makes monsters and so what I'm saying is with mental food
[03:13:59.880 --> 03:14:04.800]  we've got the choices of every library in the world incredible technology
[03:14:04.800 --> 03:14:08.720]  incredible developments understanding connectivity to other humans to spread
[03:14:08.720 --> 03:14:12.200]  ideas true diversity of ideas but so there's a certain segment of the
[03:14:12.200 --> 03:14:15.960]  population there like spoiled brats and they choose Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga
[03:14:15.960 --> 03:14:24.520]  and football and porn instead of knowing the secrets of the universe and I'm not
[03:14:24.520 --> 03:14:30.920]  saying we know them yet but we're beginning to expand out into this that's
[03:14:30.920 --> 03:14:35.440]  really the paradox I'm talking about right and that's very true and
[03:14:35.440 --> 03:14:38.840]  unfortunately there there is a certain percentage of the public that will never
[03:14:38.840 --> 03:14:42.800]  really ever tune into the to the real political reality and but as we know I
[03:14:42.800 --> 03:14:45.920]  mean in the American Revolution and in so many other revolutionary times it's
[03:14:45.920 --> 03:14:49.160]  really a small percentage that they get things going and everybody else just
[03:14:49.160 --> 03:14:52.720]  joins in once it's going so so I think your listeners and the people who are
[03:14:52.720 --> 03:14:56.360]  listening right now are are at the forefront of this and are going to be
[03:14:56.360 --> 03:14:59.680]  the ones who will be leading the charge against the New World Order and it's
[03:14:59.680 --> 03:15:03.200]  important that everyone has that understanding and really takes into
[03:15:03.200 --> 03:15:06.560]  account what's going on these days and realize that you are the vanguard and
[03:15:06.560 --> 03:15:11.080]  you are the ones carrying this torch and each of us individually can fall and
[03:15:11.080 --> 03:15:16.200]  falter but all together we cannot be stopped and history shows that as a
[03:15:16.200 --> 03:15:21.040]  fact and no amount of psychotronic weaponry is going to be able to stop us
[03:15:21.040 --> 03:15:25.160]  because either human species is ancient and it's powerful and has made in the
[03:15:25.160 --> 03:15:29.880]  image of God we are creators you little creators but we're able to do such
[03:15:29.880 --> 03:15:34.800]  amazing things and we've got that life force and our spirit and and that will
[03:15:34.800 --> 03:15:38.520]  to survive and even a subconscious level people want their children to do
[03:15:38.520 --> 03:15:42.000]  better even elitist don't want to destroy their children's future and
[03:15:42.000 --> 03:15:45.480]  they're beginning to see the system they're building will devour them as
[03:15:45.480 --> 03:15:49.040]  well but I hope listeners listen to your powerful message James Corbett that
[03:15:49.040 --> 03:15:54.040]  that we are at the historical flashpoint the crossroads the jump point and what
[03:15:54.040 --> 03:15:58.360]  you do now will echo throughout history like nothing humans had a chance to do
[03:15:58.360 --> 03:16:02.760]  before you are living in incredible times if you want to know the solution to
[03:16:02.760 --> 03:16:07.240]  fighting tyranny it is awakening it's turning off the television set it's
[03:16:07.240 --> 03:16:10.800]  getting control of your own life and then helping others and spreading the
[03:16:10.800 --> 03:16:15.520]  truth ladies and gentlemen it is your destiny if you take it up in your hands
[03:16:15.520 --> 03:16:20.200]  absolutely right and of course we know that the forces of evil are
[03:16:20.200 --> 03:16:23.840]  a raid against us and we do know that all of the various ways that we're being
[03:16:23.840 --> 03:16:28.040]  tracked and traced and controlled and and the behaviorists who have been
[03:16:28.040 --> 03:16:32.040]  studying and manipulate manipulating human society for decades and
[03:16:32.040 --> 03:16:37.080]  decades for hundreds of years now we're being carefully studied and placed into
[03:16:37.080 --> 03:16:41.520]  this carefully crafted scientifically constructed control grid and and they
[03:16:41.520 --> 03:16:44.160]  write thousands of textbooks on it and then those that won't go read the
[03:16:44.160 --> 03:16:47.400]  textbooks we show them on air laugh at us and say it didn't true folks we're
[03:16:47.400 --> 03:16:52.280]  James Corbett myself countless others again we're just people that know how
[03:16:52.280 --> 03:16:56.120]  to who stumbled upon or for whatever reason the globalist own manuals
[03:16:56.120 --> 03:17:00.600]  that's what's so sick about this James absolutely and that's an important
[03:17:00.600 --> 03:17:04.400]  point for people to take home because what I do is nothing special what you
[03:17:04.400 --> 03:17:07.880]  do is nothing special I mean we're just people who have encountered this
[03:17:07.880 --> 03:17:12.040]  incredible information and like any normal human being would when faced with
[03:17:12.040 --> 03:17:15.960]  the the magnitude of what we're facing just half and feel we have to do
[03:17:15.960 --> 03:17:19.200]  something to get this out to other people and and anyone else out there
[03:17:19.200 --> 03:17:22.680]  who's listening right now can do this and can take it up and it was actually
[03:17:22.680 --> 03:17:27.280]  me listening to this radio show four years ago that motivated me to start
[03:17:27.280 --> 03:17:31.800]  the Corbett report and I never in my wildest dreams would have imagined that
[03:17:31.800 --> 03:17:35.320]  I would have been reaching as many people as I'm reaching now just by taking
[03:17:35.320 --> 03:17:38.880]  it up and taking into my own hands and getting the word out so so you have
[03:17:38.880 --> 03:17:42.720]  out there well you have a distinctive voice and I remember when I started
[03:17:42.720 --> 03:17:45.560]  seeing your videos four years ago that it seemed like I'd heard your voice
[03:17:45.560 --> 03:17:49.840]  before had you been a caller to this show ever I've called in a couple times
[03:17:49.840 --> 03:17:54.000]  yeah in fact just after I started the Corbett report I called in and and it was
[03:17:54.000 --> 03:17:57.520]  you you said you'd seen my website so that was something to help motivate me
[03:17:57.520 --> 03:18:00.960]  even more and it was well that's what I've always tried to do I'm not perfect
[03:18:00.960 --> 03:18:06.200]  but I do want to raise up other people who are in many ways better than I am so
[03:18:06.200 --> 03:18:10.520]  that we win this thing for my children for your children for everyone this is
[03:18:10.520 --> 03:18:15.840]  life and death and you know we see the Cointel pro we see the end fighting we
[03:18:15.840 --> 03:18:20.040]  see the government operations manipulating our own you know human
[03:18:20.040 --> 03:18:26.000]  frailties but the good news is the thing I am proudest of is that so many
[03:18:26.000 --> 03:18:29.280]  people most people I ended up interviewing years later I never knew
[03:18:29.280 --> 03:18:34.280]  that about you James ended up waking up from this show and I tell you I people
[03:18:34.280 --> 03:18:38.520]  judge a tree by its fruits this radio broadcast and what it's done has been
[03:18:38.520 --> 03:18:41.320]  very very positive and it's a great responsibility but I thank you for your
[03:18:41.320 --> 03:18:45.120]  for for for taking our information and running with it because I see your
[03:18:45.120 --> 03:18:49.360]  reports we post them on info wars in prison planet and you just put things so
[03:18:49.360 --> 03:18:53.880]  concisely and in a calm focused way which will affect certain people who
[03:18:53.880 --> 03:18:57.560]  don't like my delivery so it's almost like God's out there with this you know
[03:18:57.560 --> 03:19:03.120]  his basically directing all of us in different ways to reach everybody I
[03:19:03.120 --> 03:19:08.000]  couldn't agree more and personally I am a huge fan of the Justin Bieber rant I
[03:19:08.000 --> 03:19:10.880]  think that's brilliant but I know a lot of people don't like that style of
[03:19:10.880 --> 03:19:14.960]  delivery so I'm here with a different style and together I mean we're we're
[03:19:14.960 --> 03:19:18.480]  doing it in different ways but we're saying the same thing I'm getting
[03:19:18.480 --> 03:19:22.200]  emails saying it's Bieber yeah I know it's I know it's Bieber folks it's a
[03:19:22.200 --> 03:19:27.880]  joke oh my gosh it's it's so crazy well James you know the main reason I wanted

[03:25:53.560 --> 03:25:57.120]  world next week that I do with James Evan Palotto of media monarchy.com
[03:25:57.120 --> 03:26:00.640]  where we go over three news stories every week and I've got a new series

[03:26:41.400 --> 03:26:44.560]  other reports you've done in the past the other things that you're focusing in
[03:26:44.560 --> 03:26:49.400]  on well for instance on my podcast this week I covered 30 ways you're being
[03:26:49.400 --> 03:26:53.160]  spied on and it's just basically an audio documentary collecting some of
[03:26:53.160 --> 03:26:58.560]  audio clips of all of the just craziness that that's being employed to spy on the
[03:26:58.560 --> 03:27:03.080]  American people and people all around the globe and from the blimps that the
[03:27:03.080 --> 03:27:07.680]  Utah's state police are using to the spy satellites that the American
[03:27:07.680 --> 03:27:10.560]  government is now admitting they are using against the American people to
[03:27:10.560 --> 03:27:15.640]  the cell phone tracking all of those incredible ways that that that we're
[03:27:15.640 --> 03:27:19.800]  now admittedly being tracked traced and controlled and I tried to end it on a
[03:27:19.800 --> 03:27:23.000]  bit of a positive note with someone saying that the technology that's
[03:27:23.000 --> 03:27:26.400]  enslaving us is also the technology that will free us and that we can use this
[03:27:26.400 --> 03:27:29.840]  technology against the system and I think that's something that people need to
[03:27:29.840 --> 03:27:33.240]  take the heart as well because absolutely it's important for people to
[03:27:33.240 --> 03:27:37.600]  realize that we can use this technology against the system that's trying to use
[03:27:37.600 --> 03:27:42.800]  it against us and and to what extent we can do that and whether we'll ultimately
[03:27:42.800 --> 03:27:47.160]  win is up in the air but I'm hoping that we can we can organize some sort of
[03:27:47.160 --> 03:27:50.880]  resistance that's more meaningful than just some some rioting or turning over
[03:27:50.880 --> 03:27:54.400]  cars because as we know the system is set up and geared towards violent
[03:27:54.400 --> 03:27:57.920]  revolution but they're not geared towards the revolution of the mind and
[03:27:57.920 --> 03:28:01.280]  if we light the fire in the minds of men and spread that around the world there
[03:28:01.280 --> 03:28:06.480]  is nothing that will stop free humanity yes lighting fires in the minds of men
[03:28:06.480 --> 03:28:10.000]  beautifully said here's an example of them throwing the control grid in our
[03:28:10.000 --> 03:28:16.840]  face here's the New Yorker magazine a new article just out yesterday it's the
[03:28:16.840 --> 03:28:23.200]  headline is talk about thrown in our face no big deal but Google may have
[03:28:23.200 --> 03:28:31.000]  promoted a contest to kids to get their social security numbers I'll read that
[03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:34.840]  again no big deal how like in Pennsylvania no big deal the schools
[03:28:34.840 --> 03:28:39.240]  watching your kids over laptops at home in the shower no big deal the school
[03:28:39.240 --> 03:28:43.920]  told them themselves oh we were you know we're doing it no big deal but Google
[03:28:43.920 --> 03:28:48.600]  may have promoted a contest to get kids social security numbers and then it just
[03:28:48.600 --> 03:28:52.680]  says basically it's no big deal to try to trick little kids to give them their
[03:28:52.680 --> 03:28:56.360]  social security numbers I mean is there no end to their evil how they're just
[03:28:56.360 --> 03:29:02.240]  trying to normalize classical tyranny unfortunately not and it was one of the
[03:29:02.240 --> 03:29:06.280]  Google CEOs I think it was Eric Schmidt I can't remember but he said that Google
[03:29:06.280 --> 03:29:10.080]  is all about going up to the edge of the creepy line and then not crossing it but
[03:29:10.080 --> 03:29:12.840]  of course we know they don't just like to go up to the creepy line they'd like to
[03:29:12.840 --> 03:29:17.680]  pull vault over it and see how far they can get and Google is absolutely just
[03:29:17.680 --> 03:29:21.920]  one of the most sick companies out there right now with all of their Google
[03:29:21.920 --> 03:29:25.040]  attitudes so you can spy on your friends in real time and find out where
[03:29:25.040 --> 03:29:28.880]  they're going and all the other they get you in on the evil classic ways to bathe
[03:29:28.880 --> 03:29:34.520]  people in the corruption I mean classic corruption model scientifically carried
[03:29:34.520 --> 03:29:38.840]  out it's an NSA CIA front as is Microsoft on record we were coops talking

[03:34:29.960 --> 03:34:34.400]  also bring massive attention to this radio broadcast and our message and what
[03:34:34.400 --> 03:34:38.520]  we do and so we're very excited about that and the person wants me to announce
[03:34:38.520 --> 03:34:44.240]  that or I wouldn't have I notice I don't normally do that but I'm gonna talk
[03:34:44.240 --> 03:34:47.760]  about that in about five minutes I I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up because
[03:34:47.760 --> 03:34:52.240]  well he's the owner of the network he's the guy that sponsors me he's the guy I
[03:34:52.240 --> 03:34:57.240]  buy gold and silver from and he's the guy who's bought national radio ads
[03:34:57.240 --> 03:35:03.920]  promoting this show he's the guy who is one of the big boosters on the on this
[03:35:03.920 --> 03:35:07.480]  craft and we couldn't have done any of this without Ted Anderson when I was
[03:35:07.480 --> 03:35:13.120]  fired from local radio with the number one show and its time slot because I
[03:35:13.120 --> 03:35:18.160]  wouldn't shut up about the New World Order I luckily had already gotten into
[03:35:18.160 --> 03:35:21.520]  operations with Ted and it's just been wonderful ever since but that's a
[03:35:21.520 --> 03:35:24.280]  really a side issue I just want to thank Ted for all he's done while I'm
[03:35:24.280 --> 03:35:29.800]  thanking others but Ted we have Saudi King back home orders 37 billion in
[03:35:29.800 --> 03:35:34.360]  handouts he left his pleasure palace in Europe to go back and hand out 37
[03:35:34.360 --> 03:35:37.440]  billion of the public so they don't revolt and overthrow everything there
[03:35:37.440 --> 03:35:42.760]  was a big Treasury auction today and record low numbers of countries
[03:35:42.760 --> 03:35:46.360]  individuals bought the Treasury so they're gonna monetize that oil obviously
[03:35:46.360 --> 03:35:51.280]  exploded again today was up 9% yesterday close to that again today in
[03:35:51.280 --> 03:35:55.000]  fact I'll get the actual number oh find out what oil is up today on it'll just
[03:35:55.000 --> 03:35:59.680]  say it on any article about it any new one this is commodities going up this
[03:35:59.680 --> 03:36:04.200]  is dollar devaluation this is what we've been warning people about for well
[03:36:04.200 --> 03:36:08.480]  really 12 years 13 years I learned about this from George Humphrey in 1998 I
[03:36:08.480 --> 03:36:11.440]  understood the fashion was her banking and all that but he explained to me on
[03:36:11.440 --> 03:36:16.880]  air and in his audio CD of his book I didn't read the book I listened to the
[03:36:16.880 --> 03:36:22.200]  CD derivatives and what was gonna happen because he is an economist and a very
[03:36:22.200 --> 03:36:25.160]  successful businessman and that's the real mark you got plenty of economists
[03:36:25.160 --> 03:36:27.840]  that don't know their head from a hole in the ground George Humphrey very very
[03:36:27.840 --> 03:36:31.800]  successful lives all over the world but that again itself is just some
[03:36:31.800 --> 03:36:35.760]  background and now here we are you know we told you the trains 10 miles out it's
[03:36:35.760 --> 03:36:39.760]  five miles out it's three miles out it's two miles out it's a mile out it's
[03:36:39.760 --> 03:36:46.240]  500 yards out folks it's accelerating towards us you heard Stansbury earlier
[03:36:46.240 --> 03:36:50.360]  you heard Mark Fobber a few days ago you've heard Webster Tarpley you've heard
[03:36:50.360 --> 03:36:55.000]  Ron Paul tell you to get golden silver and you've heard Ted tell you get
[03:36:55.000 --> 03:36:57.800]  bullion because you know collectors are great if you're getting the right thing
[03:36:57.800 --> 03:37:00.520]  and know what you're doing going off the little red book you know that comes out
[03:37:00.520 --> 03:37:05.680]  every year but with bullion you absolutely you know if you get it a
[03:37:05.680 --> 03:37:09.640]  little bit over spot or at spot you're doing great same thing with silver so I
[03:37:09.640 --> 03:37:12.640]  briefly wanted to bring Ted up to get his take 30 plus years in the golden
[03:37:12.640 --> 03:37:16.240]  silver business on what we're seeing happen right now we're golden silver
[03:37:16.240 --> 03:37:21.600]  look like they're going to close in the next 23 minutes we're not quite sure
[03:37:21.600 --> 03:37:24.480]  yet but where they are right now and his take on what's happening around the
[03:37:24.480 --> 03:37:29.960]  world Ted Anderson yeah sure well by the way oil is at 98 dollars and 45 cents
[03:37:29.960 --> 03:37:36.000]  up three dollars are 3.03 up so it was up 9% yesterday it went up even more
[03:37:36.000 --> 03:37:40.480]  earlier they knocked it back down some yeah well yeah it's it hit a hundred so
[03:37:40.480 --> 03:37:47.480]  I mean there you go gold is at 1417 80 silver 33 81 almost 34 dollars an ounce
[03:37:47.480 --> 03:37:52.680]  for silver you know you're talking about that Treasury sale flopping on its
[03:37:52.680 --> 03:37:57.200]  face and like you said what's going to happen now is you know it's not like the
[03:37:57.200 --> 03:38:00.880]  government's going to default on its debt or not make its obligations because it
[03:38:00.880 --> 03:38:04.440]  didn't sell its treasuries to foreigners they're going to turn to the federal
[03:38:04.440 --> 03:38:07.840]  reserve system and the printing press and that's just going to be more
[03:38:07.840 --> 03:38:11.600]  stimulus money come into the economy driving the value of the dollar down
[03:38:11.600 --> 03:38:15.200]  that's what my take is we're going to see inflation here the value of the dollar
[03:38:15.200 --> 03:38:21.000]  is on a doomsday ship here and it's just like sinking like the Titanic and for
[03:38:21.000 --> 03:38:25.840]  the some reason for the love of God knows what people will not jump off the
[03:38:25.840 --> 03:38:30.480]  ship I don't understand it why they can't see this I mean people really need
[03:38:30.480 --> 03:38:36.280]  to get away from paper money federal reserve notes are foreign countries are
[03:38:36.280 --> 03:38:41.160]  in the same same boat I mean the all of Europe is going this direction even
[03:38:41.160 --> 03:38:46.080]  China is experiencing inflation right now you really need to have physical gold
[03:38:46.080 --> 03:38:50.560]  and silver in your hands that you can use and trade and use whatever for what
[03:38:50.560 --> 03:38:54.840]  you need I mean Alex we're just sitting in a situation where you have the
[03:38:54.840 --> 03:39:00.400]  perfect economic storm and now you're adding this this Middle East tension
[03:39:00.400 --> 03:39:05.000]  along with everything else it's just beyond comprehension that people wouldn't
[03:39:05.000 --> 03:39:09.320]  even just want to jump on this so hard it's not well absolutely gold is it
[03:39:09.320 --> 03:39:14.040]  fourteen hundred ten dollars zero cents fourteen hundred and ten on them on the
[03:39:14.040 --> 03:39:18.480]  nose up eleven dollars today up a whole bunch yesterday where silver again Ted
[03:39:18.480 --> 03:39:22.960]  silver was at thirty three dollars and hang on a second let me just refresh it's
[03:39:22.960 --> 03:39:26.440]  at thirty three dollars and eighty one cents for the high currently right now at
[03:39:26.440 --> 03:39:31.040]  thirty three fifty one we've almost broke thirty four dollars now silver today I
[03:39:31.040 --> 03:39:35.640]  mean it is it's on the like it's it's on a rocket ship to the moon to mind this
[03:39:35.640 --> 03:39:40.400]  stuff is really going in and and I you know all I can say is that people should
[03:39:40.400 --> 03:39:43.880]  take advantage of it those videos that we've been offering I mean three silver
[03:39:43.880 --> 03:39:47.720]  dollars and videos there's absolutely no excuse that people don't buy this deal
[03:39:47.720 --> 03:39:50.680]  gotta be you can't hold that much longer as you're about to run out and have to
[03:39:50.680 --> 03:39:54.040]  buy silver to higher price you buy silver when it's lower knowing it's only
[03:39:54.040 --> 03:39:57.000]  gonna go up and then still pass on the savings instead of going up in prices
[03:39:57.000 --> 03:40:00.080]  like most brokers out there do most brokers aren't even holding golden
[03:40:00.080 --> 03:40:02.760]  silver they just take your order and then get it somewhere else if they can
[03:40:02.760 --> 03:40:07.840]  Ted's got it all there in-house three silver dollars which is do the math thirty
[03:40:07.840 --> 03:40:11.520]  three thirty three thirty three we're talking about ninety nine dollars and
[03:40:11.520 --> 03:40:14.120]  of course there's always stuff added on so it's over a hundred anywhere in the
[03:40:14.120 --> 03:40:19.720]  market out there and so a hundred dollar value ten dollars free shipping and then
[03:40:19.720 --> 03:40:24.760]  the sixty dollar value of Obama deception fall the Republic and in-game DVDs
[03:40:24.760 --> 03:40:29.920]  basically that's free on top with the shipping free on top if people don't do
[03:40:29.920 --> 03:40:34.120]  that deal they're they're insane so eight hundred six eight six two two three
[03:40:34.120 --> 03:40:38.320]  seven eight hundred six eight six two three seven now now Ted you're holding
[03:40:38.320 --> 03:40:41.840]  that deal I know today but you told me you shouldn't even hold it today but you
[03:40:41.840 --> 03:40:45.800]  are what are you able to hold on the old prices we had yesterday on gold or is
[03:40:45.800 --> 03:40:49.080]  that gone up I haven't talked to you today no I haven't I haven't raised the
[03:40:49.080 --> 03:40:52.640]  prices on gold because I know would be doing this today I still have the
[03:40:52.640 --> 03:40:58.320]  Franks at 308 I still have the British sovereign at 30386 those are really good
[03:40:58.320 --> 03:41:04.160]  buys I am still holding down the walking liberty half at 1576 that's gonna
[03:41:04.160 --> 03:41:09.440]  increase in price we still have creature from Jekyll Island books for 31 bucks
[03:41:09.440 --> 03:41:14.280]  with a silver dollar included in it I mean honestly I just if people could just
[03:41:14.280 --> 03:41:19.000]  take the time to educate themselves you know your portfolio needs gold
[03:41:19.000 --> 03:41:22.840]  and silver and if you haven't done it stop procrastinating you're just
[03:41:22.840 --> 03:41:26.520]  watching you know you're watching your bonds your stocks and everything go down
[03:41:26.520 --> 03:41:30.440]  the toilet and you know you better have a position in gold and silver and I'm
[03:41:30.440 --> 03:41:34.360]  not talking about some ETF thing that you're hoping that some brokerage firm
[03:41:34.360 --> 03:41:38.120]  has it stored for you I'm talking about having the real deal sitting in your
[03:41:38.120 --> 03:41:42.080]  hands and it weighs some weight and you have to store it that's what you need and
[03:41:42.080 --> 03:41:47.160]  to get the super low prices folks say that it's the radio special and then
[03:41:47.160 --> 03:41:52.080]  you will be able to get the prices that were a month ago and believe me these
[03:41:52.080 --> 03:41:56.160]  are gonna be going up very very soon as soon as Ted runs out of the supplies he
[03:41:56.160 --> 03:41:59.880]  has Ted what's the real numbers how long you think you're gonna be able to hold
[03:41:59.880 --> 03:42:03.520]  it well you know what I'd like to do your DVDs tell Friday I've got to see you
[03:42:03.520 --> 03:42:08.640]  though man I was sober if silver could be $39 an ounce and I'm saying could but
[03:42:08.640 --> 03:42:13.440]  it could be $39 an ounce before the end of this week but I just really encourage
[03:42:13.440 --> 03:42:17.880]  people I mean first of all if you have the fire in your belly for liberty if
[03:42:17.880 --> 03:42:22.520]  you want freedom get Alex's videos and share them with your friends and family

[03:42:27.600 --> 03:42:31.160]  want people to do this because that's the that's the root that's that's that's
[03:42:31.160 --> 03:42:35.040]  Ted the margins are so low on this the free $10 shipping and that's what it
[03:42:35.040 --> 03:42:38.640]  cost you about you told me it's about ten bucks right three silver dollars yeah
[03:42:38.640 --> 03:42:42.160]  if you put it all together if you do the silver dollars and the thing the whole
[03:42:42.160 --> 03:42:47.080]  deal it it comes down to about six something for shipping but it doesn't
[03:42:47.080 --> 03:42:50.720]  matter I mean it is such a discount to buy I guess you're counting your handling

[03:43:31.720 --> 03:43:38.560]  few important guests joining us but tomorrow we're going to have a Hollywood
[03:43:38.560 --> 03:43:46.520]  TV celebrity on the show who in the news cycle is as big as it gets and when it
[03:43:46.520 --> 03:43:51.640]  comes to the tabloids is the biggest it gets and when it comes to I looked at it
[03:43:51.640 --> 03:43:55.960]  last week when he did a radio interview it was 40 plus thousand news articles in
[03:43:55.960 --> 03:44:01.080]  one day on it when he went on Dan Patrick and I knew he was going on Dan
[03:44:01.080 --> 03:44:05.320]  Patrick as I was there in his car with him and Dan Patrick called him on the
[03:44:05.320 --> 03:44:08.520]  Saturday we were going to work out it's Sylvester Stallone well I'm gonna get
[03:44:08.520 --> 03:44:13.240]  into it the point is the issue I'm gonna shut up right now but the poem man I
[03:44:13.240 --> 03:44:16.720]  you knew the other stuff you could say whatever you want about Charlie Sheen
[03:44:16.720 --> 03:44:23.840]  but he's the real deal and all of us you know have have have our problems all
[03:44:23.840 --> 03:44:28.520]  of us have our demons but I went out there to helping stay sober you know
[03:44:28.520 --> 03:44:31.600]  bored there at his house hung out with him for a couple days hung out with a
[03:44:31.600 --> 03:44:37.560]  lot of other folks that were there that will go unnamed and he I mean I've been
[03:44:37.560 --> 03:44:41.280]  there when they you know the doctor comes in with the Peacup so he's been
[03:44:41.280 --> 03:44:45.600]  totally clean three weeks and I think your prayers for him really helped he
[03:44:45.600 --> 03:44:53.200]  was almost completely clean of everything for 12 years and and I think
[03:44:53.200 --> 03:44:56.400]  the prayers really help because Charlie somebody's told the truth about 9-11 I
[03:44:56.400 --> 03:45:02.240]  know him personally what a really nice guy he is and he's really coming on the
[03:45:02.240 --> 03:45:06.760]  show to talk about a host of issues that the media is gonna be interested in but
[03:45:06.760 --> 03:45:12.400]  also to help get the word out about the New World Order and to also challenge
[03:45:12.400 --> 03:45:17.320]  Barack Obama to both a listen tomorrow by the way he was contacted by the White
[03:45:17.320 --> 03:45:20.440]  House with his 20 minutes with the president thing I was there when he
[03:45:20.440 --> 03:45:24.800]  well I'm gonna get off that because that's private but I can't say he was
[03:45:24.800 --> 03:45:28.240]  contacted by the White House that 20 minutes with the president got tens of
[03:45:28.240 --> 03:45:33.720]  millions of new people to look at the bullet points of what happened and so
[03:45:33.720 --> 03:45:36.560]  Charlie told me he's not gonna do any more interviews for a long time after
[03:45:36.560 --> 03:45:43.640]  this one when he when he flew me out there just to spend time with him and
[03:45:43.640 --> 03:45:47.400]  keep his mind on politics in the New World Order and what's happening you know
[03:45:47.400 --> 03:45:51.280]  with our society I went out there to spend time with him didn't even really
[03:45:51.280 --> 03:45:54.400]  ask him to come on the show and then I saw him do Dan Patrick and I said
[03:45:54.400 --> 03:45:56.120]  don't you think you should do the show and he said yeah we'll do it next
[03:45:56.120 --> 03:46:01.520]  Thursday so Thursday is tomorrow and is the day and it's fluid exactly when he's
[03:46:01.520 --> 03:46:06.840]  gonna be on because he's traveling but he'll he'll be on within that 11 a.m. to
[03:46:06.840 --> 03:46:16.000]  2 p.m. area and I'll just leave it at that but he says a hundred percent he's
[03:46:16.000 --> 03:46:19.240]  coming on and he gave me a list of the things he wants to talk about please
[03:46:19.240 --> 03:46:22.280]  don't put the camera on this list though till tomorrow so it's got a bunch of
[03:46:22.280 --> 03:46:27.200]  inside baseball stuff but for people that say well why have Charlie sheen
[03:46:27.200 --> 03:46:31.640]  on its entertainment this would be somebody like Justin Bieber or somebody
[03:46:31.640 --> 03:46:37.280]  like Lady Gaga or somebody like Arnold Schwarzenegger who's got the attention of
[03:46:37.280 --> 03:46:42.800]  the millions of zombies as Charlie says who he wants to wake up does it mean
[03:46:42.800 --> 03:46:47.840]  he's a perfect man does it mean I am no but the point is that through him coming
[03:46:47.840 --> 03:46:50.760]  on this show will reach a lot of people and I didn't want to pre-announce in case
[03:46:50.760 --> 03:46:54.120]  they try any dirty tricks but there's been a lot of stuff going behind the
[03:46:54.120 --> 03:46:58.800]  scenes people don't even know about but he wants it announced he said he said
[03:46:58.800 --> 03:47:07.520]  tell folks that he is coming on and it's gonna be Charlie sheen unleashed so
[03:47:07.520 --> 03:47:12.320]  tomorrow 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. this will be another devastating blow on the globalist
[03:47:12.320 --> 03:47:16.080]  because the way the media cycle works so people say well they'll use that and all
[03:47:16.080 --> 03:47:20.960]  the sheen's you know stuff to try to you know no that's not how it works folks
[03:47:20.960 --> 03:47:26.200]  that's not how it works we'll get millions and millions and millions and
[03:47:26.200 --> 03:47:29.520]  millions and millions of more people visiting info wars and prison planet
[03:47:29.520 --> 03:47:33.920]  info wars.com prison planet.com it never would have and Charlie can also tell
[03:47:33.920 --> 03:47:37.440]  the truth about some things because he's the guy that tells you straight up he's
[03:47:37.440 --> 03:47:41.640]  100% straight shooter I mean the guy's famous for just giving friends you know
[03:47:41.640 --> 03:47:48.200]  $200,000 watches giving you know millions to breast cancer privately oops
[03:47:48.200 --> 03:47:50.400]  I'm not supposed to say that well I guess he's gotten awards for it but they
[03:47:50.400 --> 03:47:54.640]  didn't say how much the point is the guy's just just just I mean you ought
[03:47:54.640 --> 03:47:57.840]  to just see him there at his house just just calling charities just giving a
[03:47:57.840 --> 03:48:00.640]  millions of dollars right in front of me I mean he's not doing show off to me
[03:48:00.640 --> 03:48:07.280]  he's just he's he's like an angel and a devil isn't that how we all are I mean
[03:48:07.280 --> 03:48:11.840]  I just can't I can't describe to you the things I've had to turn down from
[03:48:11.840 --> 03:48:16.520]  Charlie Sheen he gave me one day in the mail came his first big role his prize

[03:48:32.280 --> 03:48:37.760]  gentlemen I mean you know that's why I said pray for him that's why I care
[03:48:37.760 --> 03:48:40.280]  about that's why I went out there I mean I could go out there and see him
[03:48:40.280 --> 03:48:43.280]  anytime and I probably see him about once a year because he's busy I'm busy
[03:48:43.280 --> 03:48:47.280]  I'm here doing this I'm not you know going out to Holly because most of these
[03:48:47.280 --> 03:48:50.280]  Hollywood people they invite me out there rock stars you name it some of the

[03:49:17.280 --> 03:49:20.280]  with this info they know about the New World Order they don't like the banking
[03:49:20.280 --> 03:49:23.280]  system that owns and runs Hollywood I just wish I could tell you everything I
[03:49:23.280 --> 03:49:27.280]  know but I'll only it's all in confidence and I'll just let Charlie say what he
[03:49:27.280 --> 03:49:31.280]  wants on air but Charlie's the only one of the dozens of high-powered people
[03:49:31.280 --> 03:49:35.280]  I've talked to who will come on the show who's got the time who's got the
[03:49:35.280 --> 03:49:40.280]  energy that's that's real enough that's that's passionate enough that's wild
[03:49:40.280 --> 03:49:44.280]  enough I mean he's just so real and yeah he's got a passion for women he's got
[03:49:44.280 --> 03:49:49.280]  a passion for drink who doesn't and he's trying to get away from all that but
[03:49:49.280 --> 03:49:53.280]  the point and he has successfully completely with alcohol and drugs so

[03:49:58.280 --> 03:50:02.280]  few weeks ago he didn't even know about it but he said he could feel it and
[03:50:02.280 --> 03:50:05.280]  because you know he doesn't listen all the time he's a busy guy and we're going
[03:50:05.280 --> 03:50:08.280]  to have some other good fodder for the media you know it's going to be a light
