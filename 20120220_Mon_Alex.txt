[01:59.760 --> 02:05.160]  examples of this in Egypt where neighborhoods had to get get groups of

[02:30.200 --> 02:35.200]  useful information that you'll need to know about how to stay medically safe

[02:40.360 --> 02:45.160]  preparedness scenario that may happen in the near future now you'll notice that
[02:45.160 --> 02:50.080]  we have a lot of focus on that today about preparedness that's that's because
[02:50.080 --> 02:57.120]  I mean look folks it's already February 20th March 2012 is almost upon us you
[02:57.120 --> 03:00.760]  know this is the year that a lot of people who follow the Mayan calendar
[03:00.760 --> 03:03.920]  think it's all coming to an end but I mean I guess if you follow the Mayan
[03:03.920 --> 03:06.720]  calendar you don't need to prepare it all because it's all going to be you
[03:06.720 --> 03:09.520]  know the universe is going to be destroyed and all that I don't believe
[03:09.520 --> 03:14.560]  that and I don't think you do either we need to be prepared because reality is
[03:14.560 --> 03:19.160]  still going to be here and we got to be ready for that reality of economic
[03:19.160 --> 03:23.760]  collapse of who knows what kind of political turmoil may be happening out

[03:28.560 --> 03:33.640]  in America today continues to destroy our economy continues to put more of us
[03:33.640 --> 03:37.320]  out of work continues to steal the election for Ron Paul there's so much
[03:37.320 --> 03:41.720]  evidence of total theft of the election it's now obvious that more and more
[03:41.720 --> 03:46.040]  people are getting angry more and more people are out of work something is
[03:46.040 --> 03:52.560]  changing rapidly and I want you the Alex Jones show listeners to be fully

[04:31.520 --> 04:36.880]  censorship of the voices that are telling the truth they're being silenced
[04:36.880 --> 04:43.160]  yet again so that the media speaks with one voice one mind one Borg that's

[07:07.600 --> 07:11.920]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[07:11.920 --> 07:15.360]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[07:15.360 --> 07:20.640]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements

[08:58.880 --> 09:03.640]  it's actually washington's birthday that's the official federal name of the
[09:03.640 --> 09:07.480]  holiday but now they try to make it apply to all presidents well they've
[09:07.480 --> 09:10.240]  they've been doing that for a long time of course but you know it's just a
[09:10.240 --> 09:14.200]  little trivia item for you it's actually washington's birthday which isn't even

[09:41.600 --> 09:44.880]  information by reading the incredible array of articles that are posted there
[09:44.880 --> 09:49.560]  every single day including today there's an article by Paul Craig Roberts that
[09:49.560 --> 09:52.760]  we're going to get into in a minute but as I promised you let me get you the
[09:52.760 --> 09:56.880]  names of these guests that are coming up today in the first hour here of the
[09:56.880 --> 10:03.000]  show we have Dale Carson he is a former FBI agent a former South Miami police
[10:03.000 --> 10:07.920]  officer who has written a book a very popular book called arrest proof yourself
[10:07.920 --> 10:12.440]  he can teach you how to protect your rights against overzealous law
[10:12.440 --> 10:15.920]  enforcement officers again we're not saying that law enforcement officers are
[10:15.920 --> 10:22.160]  bad in fact I mean our society would be in trouble without them at the local
[10:22.160 --> 10:26.680]  level for sure but there are times where they can be a little bit aggressive
[10:26.680 --> 10:30.840]  as we've seen you know pepper spraying the students at the rally and Dale
[10:30.840 --> 10:33.960]  Carson is going to teach us a little bit of information about how to protect our
[10:33.960 --> 10:37.440]  rights against these law enforcement officers and I may ask him about the
[10:37.440 --> 10:42.920]  failed war on drugs as well also in the second hour we have an interview with
[10:42.920 --> 10:47.600]  Joe nobody yeah that's the name that he publishes under he's got books such as
[10:47.600 --> 10:53.040]  holding your ground on Amazon and other other booksellers which teach you how to
[10:53.040 --> 10:58.000]  construct a very effective defense of your home of your property of your
[10:58.000 --> 11:02.440]  family of your community a defense against anything any economic collapse
[11:02.440 --> 11:07.600]  natural disaster you know a hurricane like hurricane Katrina situation basically
[11:07.600 --> 11:11.520]  when society collapses you want to know this guy's information so we're going to
[11:11.520 --> 11:15.040]  be bringing you that interview in the second hour don't miss that it's a it's
[11:15.040 --> 11:18.800]  a very this is a very difficult guy to book on the air by the way he doesn't
[11:18.800 --> 11:22.680]  even want to be found that's why his name is Joe nobody and he's got a lot of
[11:22.680 --> 11:25.600]  experience that you'll you'll come to learn also in the third hour we've got
[11:25.600 --> 11:31.320]  Dr. Sheldon Marks a neurosurgeon and an expert in emergency medicine
[11:31.320 --> 11:36.040]  preparedness now he is actually in surgery right now he's a micro surgeon
[11:36.040 --> 11:42.880]  who actually performs vasectomy reversals and so he's in surgery right now
[11:42.880 --> 11:46.800]  we don't want to disturb him during that process but when he gets done in the
[11:46.800 --> 11:51.840]  third hour he's going to be on our show to talk about emergency medical
[11:51.840 --> 11:59.000]  preparedness now getting into the news today Alex called me when I was on the
[11:59.000 --> 12:02.120]  the road coming into the studio today and he said Mike you've got to cover this
[12:02.120 --> 12:07.560]  story Paul Craig Roberts has written a story called silencing the critics and he
[12:07.560 --> 12:11.160]  says this may be the most important story that Paul Craig Roberts has ever
[12:11.160 --> 12:15.800]  written and he wanted to make sure I covered it this is posted right now on
[12:15.800 --> 12:19.800]  info wars dot com and it's a story about what's happening where Judge
[12:19.800 --> 12:24.240]  Napolitano has now been fired essentially from Fox News his show Freedom
[12:24.240 --> 12:29.280]  Watch which was you know by any measure one of the best most uncensored news
[12:29.280 --> 12:34.960]  shows out there I mean he dared to cover the issues like Ron Paul like the
[12:34.960 --> 12:39.440]  Constitution restoring the Bill of Rights the war with Iran and how so many
[12:39.440 --> 12:42.880]  people out there are beating the war drums to try to push us into that
[12:42.880 --> 12:49.960]  situation he dared to say that we should follow law in America which is now run
[12:49.960 --> 12:55.320]  by a group of lawless thugs lawless tyrants in Washington so he was fired
[12:55.320 --> 13:00.760]  and then Pat Buchanan was fired by MSNBC and as Paul Craig Roberts explains
[13:00.760 --> 13:05.560]  both pundits had wide followings and were appreciated for speaking frankly
[13:05.560 --> 13:10.960]  they've now both been fired so what's going on here he says the voice of the
[13:10.960 --> 13:16.320]  mainstream media is now uniform Americans hear one voice one message and
[13:16.320 --> 13:22.320]  the message is propaganda well of course it is it's all the same propaganda for
[13:22.320 --> 13:26.800]  war propaganda for drinking more aspartame propaganda for taking more
[13:26.800 --> 13:32.560]  vaccines that contain dangerous chemical adjuvants and even toxic metals
[13:32.560 --> 13:37.560]  that cause neurological damage it's always the same voice telling you to do
[13:37.560 --> 13:43.160]  things that will get you killed or steal your money or make you a slave of the
[13:43.160 --> 13:46.880]  system that's what the mainstream media is today now it's a brainwashing
[13:46.880 --> 13:52.640]  corporate control the hoax media system that has nothing to do with reality but
[13:52.640 --> 13:57.640]  everything to do with enslaving you in a system of total mindless consumerism
[13:57.640 --> 14:01.960]  and self-damage through pharmaceuticals through food additives through
[14:01.960 --> 14:06.080]  chemical pesticides that you spray on your lawn all of these things that's
[14:06.080 --> 14:10.960]  what the media exists for today drink more soda buy more stuff that you don't
[14:10.960 --> 14:14.160]  need and then kill yourself and your family with all these toxic chemicals
[14:14.160 --> 14:17.800]  that are in the food in the water and in the medicines that's what the media
[14:17.800 --> 14:22.640]  exists for today those are my comments not Paul Craig Roberts comments although
[14:22.640 --> 14:26.040]  I guess he would probably agree with that but continuing with Paul Craig
[14:26.040 --> 14:31.280]  Roberts story he says that President Obama and members of Congress along with
[14:31.280 --> 14:36.880]  Tel Aviv continue to assert that Iran is making a nuclear weapon despite public
[14:36.880 --> 14:41.440]  contradiction by the US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and the CIA as well
[14:41.440 --> 14:46.000]  I mean they they use this slippery language where they say well Iran has
[14:46.000 --> 14:54.480]  enough nuclear material to make a weapon to make a bomb well so does a every
[14:54.480 --> 14:59.880]  hospital in the US there's enough nuclear material in all the x-ray machines
[14:59.880 --> 15:03.480]  and the CAT scans to make a dirty bomb that could kill millions of people if
[15:03.480 --> 15:07.240]  you released it you know in New York City or something like that it doesn't
[15:07.240 --> 15:12.440]  mean the hospital is making a weaponized version of that material the same thing
[15:12.440 --> 15:17.880]  is true with Iran it doesn't mean Iran is is weaponizing the raw material to make
[15:17.880 --> 15:23.280]  a deliverable weapon that it doesn't mean that but but in the media now and
[15:23.280 --> 15:28.040]  again these political charlatans keep playing these word games with us so well
[15:28.040 --> 15:31.600]  Iran could be making a nuclear weapon or they have enough material now to make
[15:31.600 --> 15:36.080]  three weapons four weapons five weapons you know conveniently ignoring the fact
[15:36.080 --> 15:40.480]  that those weapons don't exist so they just they keep pushing for war getting
[15:40.480 --> 15:44.320]  back to Paul Craig Roberts who says there is no evidence that Iran has nukes
[15:44.320 --> 15:49.800]  or is making nukes no evidence whatsoever again you can read the full text of
[15:49.800 --> 15:54.520]  this story on info wars comm it's up there right now Paul says the problem
[15:54.520 --> 15:59.800]  that the problem that truth faces is that the Western media continually lies
[15:59.800 --> 16:04.240]  of course they do now he goes in to talk about Syria and Iran but then he gets
[16:04.240 --> 16:08.320]  into China check this out China is a more difficult problem Washington's plan
[16:08.320 --> 16:13.640]  is to cut China off from independent sources of energy China's oil investment
[16:13.640 --> 16:17.640]  in eastern Libya is the reason Gaddafi was overthrown and oil is one of the
[16:17.640 --> 16:21.920]  main reasons that Washington has targeted Iran China has large oil
[16:21.920 --> 16:26.520]  investments in Iran and gets 20% of its oil from Iran so therefore these are my
[16:26.520 --> 16:30.960]  words now therefore the US attacking Iran is one way to cut off this energy
[16:30.960 --> 16:35.720]  resource from China do you think China might have a few words about that do
[16:35.720 --> 16:40.560]  you think China and Russia might mind it if we start cutting off their oil
[16:40.560 --> 16:44.960]  supplies and you bet they would in fact Paul speaks to that the risk for
[16:44.960 --> 16:49.720]  Washington have multiplied he says if Washington proceeds the information that
[16:49.720 --> 16:54.120]  is conveyed to Russia and China is that they are next in line after Iran you see
[16:54.120 --> 16:59.920]  this is how we can all get drawn into a terrible world war it can happen just
[16:59.920 --> 17:03.920]  like you're seeing it happen today where again the media is pushing for war and
[17:03.920 --> 17:08.600]  everybody else is going along with it and those who are against it get fired or
[17:08.600 --> 17:15.120]  censored or criticized this is the way it works and the the result is we're
[17:15.120 --> 17:18.160]  going to end up in a situation where millions of innocent people are killed
[17:18.160 --> 17:22.320]  and we're drawn into yet more war which will centralize yet more power in the
[17:22.320 --> 17:26.640]  hands of the corrupt few who run Washington today you think about it
[17:26.640 --> 17:30.440]  Obama wants to get reelected right of course he does how's he going to do it
[17:30.440 --> 17:36.840]  strike Iran before October or in October before the election basically so that
[17:36.840 --> 17:42.400]  the people just stupidly rally around whatever current president is is sitting
[17:42.400 --> 17:47.080]  in the White House at the moment that war is is not even declared but just
[17:47.080 --> 17:51.080]  enacted again they'll bypass Cronk Congress they won't even declare an
[17:51.080 --> 17:55.280]  act of war they'll just start bombing these these so-called enemy nations
[17:55.280 --> 17:59.040]  without justification look enough on that check check out that article on
[17:59.040 --> 18:04.480]  info wars.com now in the in the few minutes that we have left here I want
[18:04.480 --> 18:08.400]  to comment on something that that Alex posted a video over the weekend this was
[18:08.400 --> 18:13.960]  a video where he went into a CVS pharmacy and he showed a brand of water
[18:13.960 --> 18:21.280]  called what's the what's the name of it nursery water right yeah nursery water with
[18:21.280 --> 18:25.240]  added fluoride in it and he walks around the CVS pharmacy in fact go ahead and
[18:25.240 --> 18:30.400]  roll that video if you've got it guys I'll speak over it he walks around the
[18:30.400 --> 18:35.760]  CVS pharmacy and he talks about all the toxic poison chemicals that are sold
[18:35.760 --> 18:41.240]  throughout the store and here here on screen for those of you watching on
[18:41.240 --> 18:46.560]  prismplanet.tv nursery water with fluoride added it says specially
[18:46.560 --> 18:52.520]  formulated for toddlers and babies this this is a war it's it's insane this is
[18:52.520 --> 18:56.600]  a war on the health of our children and he walks around he finds other things
[18:56.600 --> 19:01.960]  you know you versus the flu and he talks about the total flu hoax the truth
[19:01.960 --> 19:07.000]  is if you get flu shots your chances of actually getting the flu go up because
[19:07.000 --> 19:12.720]  your your abuse system is weakened there it is you versus the flu you win with the
[19:12.720 --> 19:17.560]  flu shot it says no you know you know who wins with a flu shot Bill Gates wins
[19:17.560 --> 19:22.640]  because he's got he's bet his money on the global depopulation agenda and the
[19:22.640 --> 19:28.880]  more of you who go out there and line up and ignorantly inject yourself with
[19:28.880 --> 19:33.480]  flu vaccines or have your children inject with flu vaccines the more you
[19:33.480 --> 19:38.240]  kill your future generations and the more people like Bill Gates global leaders
[19:38.240 --> 19:43.200]  the more they win because they rid the planet of people like you and you're
[19:43.200 --> 19:48.360]  doing it to yourself voluntary euthanasia that's what's going on today a

[24:29.480 --> 24:36.800]  be filling in next Monday one week from today when we'll be having guest Jonathan
[24:36.800 --> 24:41.520]  E. Mord yes the Jonathan E. Mord Health Freedom Attorney constitutionalist he
[24:41.520 --> 24:45.680]  has a new book coming out I believe it's called restore the Republic I haven't
[24:45.680 --> 24:49.120]  I don't have a hard copy in my hands yet so I don't know for sure but I think
[24:49.120 --> 24:51.800]  that's the name of it restoring the Republic not on sale yet being launched
[24:51.800 --> 24:56.840]  in about a week and the forward is written by Ron Paul and Jonathan E. Mord
[24:56.840 --> 25:02.040]  is you know if Ron Paul becomes president and of course we're all
[25:02.040 --> 25:06.960]  pushing for that to happen then I think Jonathan E. Mord should should be
[25:06.960 --> 25:10.240]  Attorney General you know I mean he's that that important for the future of
[25:10.240 --> 25:14.520]  our Republic very very important individual and he will be on the show
[25:14.520 --> 25:22.320]  one week from today now a scheduling note we have a bit of a scheduling error
[25:22.320 --> 25:27.520]  with Dale Carson he's actually going to be joining us also one week from today
[25:27.520 --> 25:33.280]  instead of instead of today he is the former FBI agent I mean it's no big deal
[25:33.280 --> 25:35.840]  we've got so much news to cover here anyway I didn't even get a chance to get
[25:35.840 --> 25:39.760]  to it we've got we've got robotics insects swarm technology coming out we've
[25:39.760 --> 25:44.840]  got new news coming out about test tube hamburgers they've succeeded in growing
[25:44.840 --> 25:48.480]  hamburgers and test tubes now I'll get to that in a second but but Dale Carson
[25:48.480 --> 25:53.040]  is going to be joining us one week from today instead of today my apologies for
[25:53.040 --> 25:56.640]  freaking him out he's actually in trial right now but he's the author of this
[25:56.640 --> 26:01.640]  book arrest proof yourself which is a really great book and it tells you how
[26:01.640 --> 26:07.000]  to protect your rights against police officers again nothing bad against cops
[26:07.000 --> 26:12.520]  in fact you know I used to work alongside as a as a volunteer police
[26:12.520 --> 26:17.000]  officers in Tucson Arizona as part of the nonprofit Tucson Police Foundation so
[26:17.000 --> 26:20.000]  I have a lot of respect for police officers who are who are doing their
[26:20.000 --> 26:24.000]  job but some of them get a little carried away as you have come to know
[26:24.000 --> 26:27.400]  here as an Alex Jones listener and that book teaches you how to protect
[26:27.400 --> 26:31.600]  yourself so we've got that coming up we do have at the top of this hour Joe
[26:31.600 --> 26:34.520]  nobody joining us he's the author of some additional books that we'll talk
[26:34.520 --> 26:37.640]  about and some of his information that could help you prepare but let's get
[26:37.640 --> 26:40.840]  right into the news right now first of all we've got Ron Paul with a new
[26:40.840 --> 26:45.720]  statement that just came out this weekend says Paul Paul says US is
[26:45.720 --> 26:50.640]  slipping into a fascist system and this is a speech he gave over the weekend it
[26:50.640 --> 26:56.320]  says he says we slipped away from a true republic now we're slipping into a
[26:56.320 --> 26:59.880]  fascist system where it's a combination of government and big business and
[26:59.880 --> 27:05.040]  authoritarian rule and the suppression of the individual rights of each and
[27:05.040 --> 27:10.480]  every American citizen well good for you Ron well said you couldn't you
[27:10.480 --> 27:14.360]  couldn't have emphasized it anymore that's exactly what it is I mean how
[27:14.360 --> 27:17.120]  come every presidential candidate isn't telling the truth about this how come
[27:17.120 --> 27:23.000]  they aren't all talking about our loss of rights and the monstrosity that is the
[27:23.000 --> 27:27.880]  NDAA and the Patriot Act for that matter and all of these laws so-called laws
[27:27.880 --> 27:33.960]  that take away our rights I mean only Ron Paul is qualified to be president in
[27:33.960 --> 27:37.360]  my view because he's the only one who's willing to tell the truth about the
[27:37.360 --> 27:42.920]  very dangerous centralization of power in the federal government don't don't you
[27:42.920 --> 27:48.160]  know that that's what leads to tyranny that's the the recipe for tyranny if you
[27:48.160 --> 27:53.440]  actually centralized power in the hands of anybody in a group any gang any
[27:53.440 --> 27:58.560]  corporation any entity it will seek to dominate and control everything in the
[27:58.560 --> 28:03.360]  world that's just the nature of of corporations they want to expand that's
[28:03.360 --> 28:08.280]  just the nature of military military-minded dictators they just want
[28:08.280 --> 28:11.520]  to expand like Hitler and Stalin and Mao they just want to expand and control
[28:11.520 --> 28:15.960]  everything so if you do that in America you should not be surprised if you get
[28:15.960 --> 28:21.280]  the same result of total outrageous tyranny from Washington next story this
[28:21.280 --> 28:27.080]  is one I wrote naturalnews.com test tube meat is here this was also announced
[28:27.080 --> 28:33.120]  over the weekend they've been able to grow meat and fat using bovine fetal
[28:33.120 --> 28:38.840]  cells in a vat of liquid with circulating nutrients and the little
[28:38.840 --> 28:44.280]  muscle fibers actually pulse and twitch as they're growing and then once the
[28:44.280 --> 28:48.360]  growth is done they grind them up with some other fat cells some bovine fat
[28:48.360 --> 28:55.800]  cells that they have also grown using bovine fetal stem cells and then they
[28:55.800 --> 28:59.560]  grind this up into a delicious hamburger patty hey you want some fries with
[28:59.560 --> 29:05.560]  that that sounds like a real happy meal doesn't it nasty stuff so my question
[29:05.560 --> 29:09.480]  about this obviously this is being promoted as a way to save the planet
[29:09.480 --> 29:14.280]  this is more environmentally friendly you're all going to eat processed vat
[29:14.280 --> 29:19.160]  produced scientifically generated and formulated and engineered bovine fetal
[29:19.160 --> 29:25.080]  stem cell cow burger patties get used to it you are the new generation of
[29:25.080 --> 29:29.120]  soylent green consumers how dare you want to eat actual beef that walked around
[29:29.120 --> 29:34.920]  on four hooves yeah we'll talk about more on that story when we return here
[29:34.920 --> 29:38.320]  this is Mike Adams on the Alex Jones show stay with us we'll be right back

[33:08.320 --> 33:14.600]  have you ever noticed that everything they say is being introduced to save the
[33:14.600 --> 33:20.200]  planet is usually something that's going to kill you or gross you out we were
[33:20.200 --> 33:24.000]  just talking before the break about this test tube hamburger meat that they've
[33:24.000 --> 33:29.040]  now successfully grown in these vats of circulating nutrients also floating
[33:29.040 --> 33:37.920]  along with some bovine fetus stem cells yum and they say the the meat is well
[33:37.920 --> 33:42.640]  wait here's a quote from the scientist Mark Post who announced this I'm not
[33:42.640 --> 33:46.120]  bashing Mark Post he's just doing his research he probably has no idea how
[33:46.120 --> 33:51.700]  this is going to be used by the globalists to sicken people but he says
[33:51.700 --> 33:55.240]  this year in October we're going to provide a proof of concept showing out
[33:55.240 --> 33:59.480]  of stem cells we can make a product that looks feels and hopefully tastes like
[33:59.480 --> 34:04.920]  meat that's that's what I thought the last time I went to McDonald's like 20
[34:04.920 --> 34:10.480]  years ago it almost looks and feels it almost tastes like meat but I'm not sure
[34:10.480 --> 34:15.280]  let's talk about chicken McNuggets and mechanically separated chicken no that
[34:15.280 --> 34:19.440]  would be another comedy segment but they say this is great for the environment
[34:19.440 --> 34:22.600]  all right they say it's more can fit a more efficient conversion of plants to
[34:22.600 --> 34:28.360]  meet in these laboratory vats how wonderful less environmental damage more
[34:28.360 --> 34:34.680]  humane than killing animals and it's the only feasible way to feed the world all
[34:34.680 --> 34:39.720]  the meat it craves but I say wait a second wait a second if they're growing
[34:39.720 --> 34:43.200]  this meat in vats of circulating nutrients what do you think they're
[34:43.200 --> 34:47.880]  going to put in those nutrients a little MSG to have it built into the cells so
[34:47.880 --> 34:52.800]  that their lab produced meat actually tastes better so that you'll eat it they
[34:52.800 --> 34:58.160]  love to use MSG for that so what about hormones to make the meat grow faster so
[34:58.160 --> 35:01.480]  they can just put these bovine hormones right into the circulating fluid I I'm
[35:01.480 --> 35:05.760]  sure the USDA will be fine with that and the FDA I know no problem whatever
[35:05.760 --> 35:10.280]  chemicals you want to use they FDA has never met a chemical it didn't like you
[35:10.280 --> 35:13.200]  know put it in the food who cares it's even probably going to go into infant
[35:13.200 --> 35:17.520]  formula but what about this what about the genetic engineering of these stem
[35:17.520 --> 35:22.040]  cells that are used to grow this meat you see I came up with the idea that
[35:22.040 --> 35:27.000]  eventually they would have to try to combine genetic code from different
[35:27.000 --> 35:31.000]  species to try to maximize this meat so you can end up with hamburger patties
[35:31.000 --> 35:36.960]  that are made with partial partially cow or goats or maybe insects to bind it
[35:36.960 --> 35:43.440]  together like a carnuba wax type of production from those little meat strips
[35:43.440 --> 35:46.880]  to hold it together you know to bind it together what if they put in some human
[35:46.880 --> 35:51.680]  genes to make sure that the meat is not doesn't cause allergic reactions in
[35:51.680 --> 35:57.840]  humans so you can end up actually in eating a a hybrid bovine human processed
[35:57.840 --> 36:05.760]  meat product laced with MSG MSG antibiotics and hormones and this is
[36:05.760 --> 36:10.800]  called the solution the solution I love it when Bill Gates goes out there and
[36:10.800 --> 36:14.080]  says you know the solution is just more technology because you know the
[36:14.080 --> 36:17.440]  pharmaceutical model has been so effective and so good all this high
[36:17.440 --> 36:22.920]  technology he calls GMOs now are called high-tech agriculture yeah because
[36:22.920 --> 36:27.720]  technology has been so good just look at well television and nuclear power and
[36:27.720 --> 36:33.200]  pesticides and fluoride and aspartame aren't these wonderful examples of
[36:33.200 --> 36:38.560]  helping to save the world oh yeah technology is our savior now we don't
[36:38.560 --> 36:43.840]  need anything real all right nice speaking to something real let me let me
[36:43.840 --> 36:49.400]  mention this this is this is a plug for inner food that comes from yours truly

[37:54.680 --> 37:58.800]  patriots there who are making some good food for us now moving on to the news
[37:58.800 --> 38:03.400]  about food did you know that baby formula that's formulated with brown rice
[38:03.400 --> 38:10.600]  syrup as the sweetener can contain up to 3,000% more arsenic than formula
[38:10.600 --> 38:14.720]  without the brown rice syrup yes a new study this is out of Dartmouth College
[38:14.720 --> 38:20.640]  shows that there has been alarmingly high levels of arsenic found in infant
[38:20.640 --> 38:26.760]  formula one organic infant formula product that was sweetened with brown
[38:26.760 --> 38:33.560]  rice syrup contained six times the level the limit set by the EPA for safe
[38:33.560 --> 38:39.840]  drinking water and this is what parents are feeding their babies now and it's
[38:39.840 --> 38:43.920]  also present in cereal bars you know brown rice syrup is a very popular
[38:43.920 --> 38:47.800]  sweetener now look bottom line is normally brown rice syrup is a very
[38:47.800 --> 38:51.280]  healthy sweetener nothing wrong with it it's high in mineral content it's
[38:51.280 --> 38:55.760]  relatively low on the glycemic index and so on but because these banned
[38:55.760 --> 39:00.280]  pesticides are being used to grow some of this stuff the high levels of arsenic
[39:00.280 --> 39:04.000]  are being embedded in the soils and then it's picked up by the brown rice which
[39:04.000 --> 39:08.520]  tends to pick up a lot of minerals which include these these metals like
[39:08.520 --> 39:12.960]  arsenic and then that gets into the food and of course arsenic not not a very
[39:12.960 --> 39:19.520]  good situation but when I posted this article I guess a day or two ago it's
[39:19.520 --> 39:24.680]  written by Elizabeth Walling and we got a bunch of flak from people you know no
[39:24.680 --> 39:29.520]  matter what toxin we always expose aluminum in this product arsenic in
[39:29.520 --> 39:32.640]  this product pesticides in this product there's always a bunch of
[39:32.640 --> 39:38.320]  apologists out there who say ah don't worry about that it's okay you get
[39:38.320 --> 39:43.280]  arsenic in when you eat bananas anyway or you get aluminum from you know cooking
[39:43.280 --> 39:46.400]  on your in your microwave whatever it doesn't matter there's always these
[39:46.400 --> 39:51.040]  apologists who say yeah a little bit of arsenic don't worry about a joey you know
[39:51.040 --> 39:56.020]  but what about the combination what about all the fluoride all the the heavy
[39:56.020 --> 40:01.320]  metals all the mercury all the aluminum all the the arsenic in this case and you
[40:01.320 --> 40:04.600]  add that into the psychiatric drugs that people are on and the antidepressants
[40:04.600 --> 40:09.000]  that people are on and the pesticides and the formaldehyde venting from the
[40:09.000 --> 40:12.960]  furniture in your own house and the fluorescent lights that flicker and
[40:12.960 --> 40:16.920]  alter your brain function with with the flicker rate of the lights and they
[40:16.920 --> 40:23.560]  have mercury in them too and you add it all up and then what do you get you get
[40:23.560 --> 40:26.920]  total toxic overload and that's what we're seeing today that's what we're
[40:26.920 --> 40:31.040]  seeing that the slow euthanization of the American population well it's not
[40:31.040 --> 40:34.760]  just America it's the whole world but this is true you know this is happening
[40:34.760 --> 40:39.080]  if babies are being poisoned right now I'm speaking about babies children and
[40:39.080 --> 40:43.760]  food remember that story about a week ago in North Carolina where that school
[40:43.760 --> 40:47.600]  that elementary school had the food police out and they were searching
[40:47.600 --> 40:51.400]  through the bags of the children's little lunch bags brought from home and
[40:51.400 --> 40:56.080]  saying oh you don't have your lunch doesn't meet USDA guidelines you don't
[40:56.080 --> 41:00.400]  have a serving of pasteurized dead milk you don't have a serving of processed
[41:00.400 --> 41:05.040]  meat laced with sodium nitrite with which causes brain cancer and tumors and
[41:05.040 --> 41:09.840]  pancreatic cancer and colon cancer they said how dare you bring your lunch from
[41:09.840 --> 41:13.200]  home well that happened a week ago now there's been another incident from the
[41:13.200 --> 41:18.120]  same school a woman a mother has stepped forward Diane Zambrano this is
[41:18.120 --> 41:24.000]  reported in the blaze Diane Zambrano says her four-year-old daughter is the
[41:24.000 --> 41:29.120]  latest victim of the food police at the West Hawk or Hokie elementary school I
[41:29.120 --> 41:34.240]  don't know how to pronounce West Hawk probably elementary school her mom had
[41:34.240 --> 41:38.280]  dared to pack her a lunch containing a cheese and salami sandwich on a wheat
[41:38.280 --> 41:43.840]  bun with apple juice but no no that didn't conform to the school food
[41:43.840 --> 41:47.680]  police who are apparently still operating instead she was taken to the
[41:47.680 --> 41:55.160]  cafeteria and fed chicken nuggets yeah chicken nuggets a sweet potato bread and
[41:55.160 --> 42:01.200]  pasteurized homogenized dead cows milk oh because that's so much better than the
[42:01.200 --> 42:05.000]  lunch that her mom packed her because yeah chicken nuggets I mean gee almost
[42:05.000 --> 42:10.440]  half of the nugget is actually chicken the other half I'm not exactly sure what
[42:10.440 --> 42:14.840]  it is but the chicken half is mechanically separated chicken you know
[42:14.840 --> 42:19.760]  how you make that you take a chicken carcass with all the skin and bones and
[42:19.760 --> 42:24.360]  tendons and fat and you throw it in a giant blender like a blend tech or a
[42:24.360 --> 42:29.600]  Vitamix you blend that up and it makes a giant pink mass of goo and then you
[42:29.600 --> 42:33.520]  crush that through a strainer we should do this on camera one day right here in
[42:33.520 --> 42:36.840]  the studio that'd be a lot of fun I'm sure Alex would appreciate that you
[42:36.840 --> 42:40.560]  crush it through a strainer to get the bones out of it and then you end up with
[42:40.560 --> 42:46.320]  this pink goo this mass you shape it into the shape of a chicken nugget and you
[42:46.320 --> 42:50.120]  roll it around in some bread and you fry it in some deep fried oil that's been
[42:50.120 --> 42:53.880]  used over and over again week after week after week and the high temperatures
[42:53.880 --> 42:58.400]  create cancer-causing acrylamides in addition to the MSG and the other yeast
[42:58.400 --> 43:02.400]  extract taste excitotoxins that are added to the nugget to make it taste like
[43:02.400 --> 43:06.800]  real chicken when it's actually just crushed up blended chicken carcass this
[43:06.800 --> 43:14.040]  this is USDA compliant this is what the child must eat at West Hokey elementary
[43:14.040 --> 43:20.840]  school really did they forget their own nutrition classes it's unbelievable
[43:20.840 --> 43:26.120]  these people are insane it's not just that it's not just the chemicals that
[43:26.120 --> 43:29.400]  they're feeding the four-year-olds in in in the school yeah there's a there's a
[43:29.400 --> 43:32.480]  picture on screen for those of you watching it prisonplant.tv the
[43:32.480 --> 43:37.040]  mechanically separated chicken looks like a giant taffy snake it's like a
[43:37.040 --> 43:46.640]  four-inch diameter just a nasty extrusion of goo chicken goo whoo yummy
[43:46.640 --> 43:52.440]  it's making me hungry right here in the studio all right enough of that I don't
[43:52.440 --> 43:55.440]  want to gross you out let's move on to some other news we published those
[43:55.440 --> 43:59.880]  green companies with political ties to Obama continue to receive billions of
[43:59.880 --> 44:04.680]  dollars in federal funds gee no surprise there hey if you're a buddy of the
[44:04.680 --> 44:08.400]  White House you get money and your company doesn't even have to have a
[44:08.400 --> 44:12.240]  profit you can just pay yourself salaries and lose money quarter after
[44:12.240 --> 44:16.560]  quarter after quarter and then eventually go bankrupt by blowing the tax
[44:16.560 --> 44:20.800]  payers dollars that's what you get if you're a buddy of Obama here's an
[44:20.800 --> 44:25.920]  example venture capitalist Sanjay Waggle I hope I'm getting his name right he
[44:25.920 --> 44:30.680]  was an Obama fundraiser in 2008 he went from private sector to the energy
[44:30.680 --> 44:37.040]  department and he his firm over the next three years the energy department
[44:37.040 --> 44:43.600]  provided 2.8 billion dollars in funding to clean energy companies in which
[44:43.600 --> 44:48.880]  Waggle's former venture capital firm vantage point venture partners had
[44:48.880 --> 44:53.640]  invested so he goes to Washington first he fundraised for Obama goes to
[44:53.640 --> 44:58.240]  Washington funnels money through the venture capital firm into all these so
[44:58.240 --> 45:03.880]  called green companies in all 3.9 billion dollars in funds were provided to 21
[45:03.880 --> 45:08.320]  companies with ties to firms who had connections to five different
[45:08.320 --> 45:13.200]  administration advisors and staffers of the Obama administration and how many of
[45:13.200 --> 45:16.840]  these have now gone broke I don't know the exact number but it's a large number
[45:16.840 --> 45:19.960]  it's like every week you read another green company going bankrupt you know
[45:19.960 --> 45:24.760]  this is the opposite of the free market folks forget about innovation and
[45:24.760 --> 45:29.400]  entrepreneurship and people who are willing to work hard the American way
[45:29.400 --> 45:33.840]  you know to create real jobs private sector jobs and hire people and create a
[45:33.840 --> 45:38.400]  superior product and actually have a profit quarter after quarter while you're
[45:38.400 --> 45:42.720]  helping the economy forget that yeah I guess that's ancient history in America
[45:42.720 --> 45:48.880]  now the way to get your money is to cozy up to the next corrupt presidential
[45:48.880 --> 45:53.320]  candidate and then get into the energy department or the Department of Commerce
[45:53.320 --> 45:57.800]  or whatever whatever the case may be maybe get into the into DHS get yourself
[45:57.800 --> 46:03.720]  a military contract take all that money ride high like a fat cat blow the money
[46:03.720 --> 46:09.280]  on jet skis and junkets to exotic locations and then when your company
[46:09.280 --> 46:14.200]  goes bankrupt just sell must have been the bad economy we couldn't help it we
[46:14.200 --> 46:20.200]  tried our best while we were eating lobster in Hawaii thinking about the
[46:20.200 --> 46:25.480]  new economy that's the new capitalism isn't it sick isn't it sick and and
[46:25.480 --> 46:28.360]  meanwhile the hard-working people out there like those listening to this show
[46:28.360 --> 46:33.400]  who are working for a living are being taxed to death you know your productivity
[46:33.400 --> 46:37.440]  productivity is being taken away your jobs are being shifted to Mexico and
[46:37.440 --> 46:42.240]  China you are the ones being punished for your ideas for having actual
[46:42.240 --> 46:46.360]  innovation because of course the whole plan in this country is to shut down the
[46:46.360 --> 46:49.840]  actual economy the real economy and just have everything a centralized
[46:49.840 --> 46:53.800]  centrally planned China like economy where you got to be buddies with the
[46:53.800 --> 46:57.480]  right people in order to get money to do anything and the rest of you're just
[46:57.480 --> 47:00.840]  gonna end up paying taxes like under the French system where it's what is it like
[47:00.840 --> 47:08.840]  87% tax rate so you live on pennies that's it that's what's going on we
[47:08.840 --> 47:12.360]  still we still have a few minutes left here so I'm gonna cover more news remember
[47:12.360 --> 47:15.600]  the top of the hour we've got Joe nobody joining us at the top of the next hour
[47:15.600 --> 47:19.960]  that's gonna be a really great segment so be sure to stay tuned for that this is
[47:19.960 --> 47:23.880]  out of the independent experts fear diseases are now impossible to treat
[47:23.880 --> 47:28.720]  they're talking about the antibiotic resistant strains not just MRSA but
[47:28.720 --> 47:34.040]  E. Coli new strains oh yeah they've got all new strains for you it's kind of
[47:34.040 --> 47:41.400]  like version 12 now of these antibiotic resistant bacteria and they of course
[47:41.400 --> 47:46.120]  were created by the fact that doctors and hospitals abuse antibiotics and they
[47:46.120 --> 47:50.800]  create an environment in which these bacteria mutate to become resistant they
[47:50.800 --> 47:54.920]  mutate very quickly they are creating a superbug weapon almost it's like the
[47:54.920 --> 48:00.680]  hospitals are the weapon factories to create the superbugs that if they escape
[48:00.680 --> 48:06.200]  the hospitals could kill literally tens of millions of people I'm not trying to
[48:06.200 --> 48:09.960]  scare you about that because there are natural ways to defend yourself against
[48:09.960 --> 48:14.720]  that you know silver lungs anybody that's what I would use but there are lots
[48:14.720 --> 48:20.160]  of ways to defend yourself but the whole medical system doesn't want to have
[48:20.160 --> 48:24.880]  sanity in the hospitals they don't want to use probiotics they don't want to use
[48:24.880 --> 48:28.800]  colloidal silver they don't want to use copper plated tables even though they've
[48:28.800 --> 48:34.400]  been scientifically proven to eliminate or greatly reduce superbug infections
[48:34.400 --> 48:38.680]  instead they want people to be sick they love the fact that you go in for some
[48:38.680 --> 48:42.560]  chemotherapy and then you come out with kidney failure and then you need kidney
[48:42.560 --> 48:47.520]  dialysis they love the fact that your psychiatric drug or your antidepressant
[48:47.520 --> 48:52.160]  drug causes diabetes so then you come back for a diabetes drug and a diabetes
[48:52.160 --> 48:57.000]  treatment they love it it's a chain reaction of repeat business that comes
[48:57.000 --> 49:01.040]  from corporations treating human beings like guinea pigs and having no
[49:01.040 --> 49:06.240]  compassion for human life and having absolutely no ethics absolutely no no
[49:06.240 --> 49:10.720]  real sense of what it takes to be an adult human being contributing to a
[49:10.720 --> 49:16.720]  free world you know and I'm just I'm tired of it I'm sick of it why can't
[49:16.720 --> 49:20.600]  we have people like Ron Paul in charge of the politics why can't we have real
[49:20.600 --> 49:24.840]  nutritionists in charge of the health care system why can't we have people who
[49:24.840 --> 49:30.080]  don't want war in charge of a department of peace go for some global peace I
[49:30.080 --> 49:34.120]  don't mean not defend our shores obviously let's defend ourselves and
[49:34.120 --> 49:39.160]  kudos to the veterans who took part in the legitimate defense but why do we
[49:39.160 --> 49:42.520]  have to go around just mucking up everything all around the world with
[49:42.520 --> 49:46.040]  more war more pharmaceuticals more vaccines more poison in the hospitals
[49:46.040 --> 49:52.240]  more antibiotic resistant drugs or I'm sorry strains of bacteria because of
[49:52.240 --> 49:56.840]  the drugs that's what we have today it's total insanity and the result is going
[49:56.840 --> 50:01.640]  to be nothing but death mass death one more story British government now
[50:01.640 --> 50:06.280]  considers using nerve agents on their own people I mean you would think I'm
[50:06.280 --> 50:10.800]  making this up it's not April 1 no it's February 20 and this is real that the
[50:10.800 --> 50:18.880]  rioters in Britain now could be soon hit with nerve agent chemicals yeah a
[50:18.880 --> 50:22.840]  little how about little mustard gas for all you rioters out there speaking out
[50:22.840 --> 50:27.640]  against the Queen talking about the Queen gets raw milk but nobody else can
[50:27.640 --> 50:32.120]  get raw milk that you're gonna get hit with some nerve gas agents some nerve
[50:32.120 --> 50:36.360]  chemicals courtesy of the British government that story yeah that's from
[50:36.360 --> 50:43.160]  that is from natural news by D Holt oh man I can't even cover all the news I
[50:43.160 --> 50:47.400]  can't even cover everything that's on info wars.com or my website or any of
[50:47.400 --> 50:50.960]  the others out there's just too much crazy news but we're gonna do our best so
[50:50.960 --> 50:55.080]  stay with us right here on the Alex Jones show we will be right back after
[50:55.080 --> 51:01.400]  this break with more breaking news and I guess coming right up stay with us I've
[51:01.400 --> 51:05.640]  been telling you about e-foods direct for a while now here are my top 10 reasons
[51:05.640 --> 51:09.720]  to stock up on food for me foods direct number 10 the food I get from e-foods
[51:09.720 --> 51:14.000]  direct tastes great number nine the e-foods meals are easy to prepare eight
[51:14.000 --> 51:18.240]  e-foods direct delivers the food right to my front door seven most of these

[54:00.440 --> 54:08.720]  he's the T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[54:10.720 --> 54:17.080]  it occurred to me during the break that in every sport when you have more points
[54:17.080 --> 54:21.760]  you're winning right you know you score a touchdown you make a
[54:21.760 --> 54:29.320]  basket you kick the ball through the goal you make a point it's plus one or
[54:29.320 --> 54:34.440]  plus seven or plus six whatever the case may be but in the world of eugenics the
[54:34.440 --> 54:38.760]  winning score is always a minus one and if you look at Bill Gates and his
[54:38.760 --> 54:44.640]  formula for population control and success he has P for population and he's
[54:44.640 --> 54:48.840]  got this this formula that he talks about publicly and when P equals P minus
[54:48.840 --> 54:53.600]  one that's like a victory for Bill Gates think about it like the more people
[54:53.600 --> 54:57.920]  die the more they think they're winning that you know the globalists that's
[54:57.920 --> 55:00.960]  pretty sick that's a pretty good indication that something's wrong with
[55:00.960 --> 55:09.080]  that picture what do they cheer when people die in car crashes the cheer
[55:09.080 --> 55:16.360]  like save the planet you rolled his SUV over six times planets better off you
[55:16.360 --> 55:20.840]  know this is some kind of sick eugenics logic anyway okay the Harvard
[55:20.840 --> 55:25.960]  micro robotics lab has introduced or announced a new technology they call the
[55:25.960 --> 55:32.720]  monolithic bee that can allow the creation of swarms of insect drones that
[55:32.720 --> 55:36.760]  can now be fabricated with a brand new technology it's kind of a pop-up
[55:36.760 --> 55:41.480]  fabrication technology you know your your children's pop-up books you know
[55:41.480 --> 55:45.520]  where you don't put it up and then it pops up they can do this now at the
[55:45.520 --> 55:52.000]  microchip level using exotic materials to pop up an actual insect and we've
[55:52.000 --> 55:55.560]  got some footage of that go and roll that footage while I explain this if
[55:55.560 --> 55:59.600]  you can you can watch this on prismplanet.tv there it is the little
[55:59.600 --> 56:03.640]  insect this is smaller than a penny this little insect is popping up and
[56:03.640 --> 56:10.600]  assembling itself out of well silicon and some metals and then it's it gets
[56:10.600 --> 56:16.120]  soldered together see it assembles itself in about one second it's about a one
[56:16.120 --> 56:21.160]  second activity and then it can lock itself into place and then it's got this
[56:21.160 --> 56:26.920]  unique soldering technology the point is that the the scientists who created
[56:26.920 --> 56:32.480]  this say quote it is a process well suited to mass production enabling
[56:32.480 --> 56:37.880]  parallel manufacture of large numbers of robotic devices that's just what we
[56:37.880 --> 56:43.280]  need isn't it yeah large numbers of spy drones now this reminds me of that scene
[56:43.280 --> 56:49.480]  in Terminator 2 remember the scene where that scientists is talking about they
[56:49.480 --> 56:53.600]  got this microchip from the robotic arm and they've been studying it and it's
[56:53.600 --> 56:55.960]  leading them in all kinds of new directions that they never could have
[56:55.960 --> 56:59.440]  imagined before there it is smaller than a penny for those of you still
[56:59.440 --> 57:05.240]  watching incredible like if this was flying around your house spying on you
[57:05.240 --> 57:08.720]  you couldn't even you wouldn't even know it's there of course they don't have a
[57:08.720 --> 57:12.280]  power supply to it yet they don't have a video camera small enough to fly around
[57:12.280 --> 57:16.520]  on it yet but imagine in the future you know what they're gonna do with these
[57:16.520 --> 57:21.400]  they're gonna have vaccine needles out the front I mean Bill Gates is already
[57:21.400 --> 57:26.800]  using genetically modified mosquitoes to have a vaccine type of technology to
[57:26.800 --> 57:31.520]  vaccinate people why not do it with these electronic monolithic bees these
[57:31.520 --> 57:35.160]  little insect swarms put vaccines on the front of them and have them do little
[57:35.160 --> 57:40.600]  kamikaze missions on all the people who have exposed arms by the way you know a
[57:40.600 --> 57:44.160]  little tip most of these robotics that are coming and Alex has talked about
[57:44.160 --> 57:50.200]  that on the show the robotics are coming the robotic warriors or the the
[57:50.200 --> 57:53.160]  terminators so to speak but they're gonna be flying drones first they already
[57:53.160 --> 57:58.440]  are flying drones most of them are going to detect humans using infrared
[57:58.440 --> 58:03.000]  sensors and let me just give you guys all of you listening this look this
[58:03.000 --> 58:06.640]  little tip if you don't already know if you want to make yourself invisible to
[58:06.640 --> 58:12.640]  infrared make yourself a space blanket poncho yeah just take a space blanket
[58:12.640 --> 58:17.800]  cut a hole in it you know put it put it on like a poncho and then the robot
[58:17.800 --> 58:21.520]  drones can't see you except your your head the space blanket keeps the
[58:21.520 --> 58:25.920]  infrared rays inside makes you basically camouflage to the robot you may
[58:25.920 --> 58:29.200]  laugh but that may come in very handy in the near future stay with us this is the
[58:29.200 --> 58:32.480]  Alex Jones show Mike Adams hosting we'll be right back after this break with
[58:32.480 --> 58:39.080]  more news from the incredible world of reality see ya
[58:39.080 --> 58:52.520]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network I had tried everything I'd
[58:52.520 --> 58:56.520]  cut back the amount of food I was eating I was lifting weights and jogging but
[58:56.520 --> 59:00.760]  nothing was working my body was literally starving for minerals and trace
[59:00.760 --> 59:05.560]  elements as well as key vitamins and as soon as I had that I immediately could
[59:05.560 --> 59:10.040]  eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied now there are
[59:10.040 --> 59:13.560]  hundreds of great products at infowars team dot com but I want to point out
[59:13.560 --> 59:21.520]  the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months products like
[59:21.520 --> 59:26.160]  beyond tangy tangerine pollen burst and rebound when I started taking the
[59:26.160 --> 59:30.880]  tangy tangerine and other products every day I lost more than 37 pounds in just
[59:30.880 --> 59:35.920]  two months now that's results I want to challenge my listeners to go to info
[59:35.920 --> 59:40.680]  wars team dot com and order just three of their products and you will see the
[59:40.680 --> 59:45.920]  changes in the way you look feel and in your appetite almost immediately start
[59:45.920 --> 59:54.600]  your journey to health and wellness today info wars team dot com waging war
[59:54.600 --> 1:00:08.280]  on corruption alex jones on the GCM radio network big brother mainstream media
[1:00:08.280 --> 1:00:15.640]  government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the
[1:00:15.640 --> 1:00:24.960]  GCM radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones welcome to the
[1:00:24.960 --> 1:00:28.920]  second hour of the alex jones show this is mike adams the health ranger filling
[1:00:28.920 --> 1:00:33.800]  in for alex today alex is on the road it's monday february 20th i'll be
[1:00:33.800 --> 1:00:39.400]  hosting also one week from today the 27th when we'll be featuring jonathan
[1:00:39.400 --> 1:00:44.680]  e-mord yes our favorite health freedom attorney he has defeated the FDA several
[1:00:44.680 --> 1:00:48.400]  times in the past he has a new book coming out with a a forward written by
[1:00:48.400 --> 1:00:52.440]  ron paul so he'll be on the show also will be joined by dale karson next
[1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:59.400]  week the former fbi agent former swat team member former south miami cop who
[1:00:59.400 --> 1:01:04.040]  has got a lot of great information now getting back to the news in this segment
[1:01:04.040 --> 1:01:07.000]  is something i really wanted to be sure to cover today we just talked about the
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:13.480]  robotic insect swarms that technology is real they have a new method now where
[1:01:13.480 --> 1:01:17.840]  they can mass produce these insect robot drones and it's only a matter of time
[1:01:17.840 --> 1:01:22.520]  before they start swarming around your house your backyard keeping tabs on you
[1:01:22.520 --> 1:01:27.680]  spying on you and it's all going to be done under the guys of protecting you
[1:01:27.680 --> 1:01:32.120]  hmm yeah you're safer now that the insect swarms are keeping an eye on
[1:01:32.120 --> 1:01:37.120]  everything it's an eye in the sky it's like it's like mom looking down on you
[1:01:37.120 --> 1:01:43.760]  from above it's like the federal family keeping an eye on your backyard to make
[1:01:43.760 --> 1:01:47.720]  sure your little toddler doesn't drown in your pool yeah that's why they're
[1:01:47.720 --> 1:01:51.480]  swarming around there now they're gonna be swarming everywhere making sure that
[1:01:51.480 --> 1:01:56.080]  none of us do anything that might be considered an act of terrorism such as
[1:01:56.080 --> 1:02:03.120]  paying with cash yes paying with cash or what having a tattoo missing a finger
[1:02:03.120 --> 1:02:06.080]  what remember that from what was it about a week and a half ago all these
[1:02:06.080 --> 1:02:10.840]  things that that indicate that you might be a terrorist I think I think Alex
[1:02:10.840 --> 1:02:16.000]  Jones should do kind of a Jeff Fox worthy joke segment you know that you
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:19.520]  might be a redneck to do you might be a terrorist if you know if you have a
[1:02:19.520 --> 1:02:25.320]  tattoo of Janet Napolitano on your upper thigh you might be crazy actually if
[1:02:25.320 --> 1:02:30.000]  you have that let's not even go there here's something you really need to know
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:36.480]  about neotame is the new aspartame neotame spread the word folks this is
[1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:41.600]  the next chemical sweetener to avoid and it's being very heavily marketed the
[1:02:41.600 --> 1:02:48.320]  creators of neotame of course the same people who created aspartame have the
[1:02:48.320 --> 1:02:56.080]  look the patent ran out on aspartame I believe that ran out in 1992 and of
[1:02:56.080 --> 1:02:59.120]  course they've tried to have they always try to have replacements for patents so
[1:02:59.120 --> 1:03:02.840]  they have to add some chemical or alter a molecule or something to get a new
[1:03:02.840 --> 1:03:10.820]  patent well neotame is the more potent more refined version of aspartame which
[1:03:10.820 --> 1:03:17.240]  Dr. Russell Blalock describes as an excitotoxin a nerve damaging toxin well
[1:03:17.240 --> 1:03:21.200]  neotame as another molecule I believe if memory serves me correctly that
[1:03:21.200 --> 1:03:27.560]  molecule is three dimethyl butyl not that it matters what the what the
[1:03:27.560 --> 1:03:32.120]  syllables are in it it's just another chemical and it's not a chemical that
[1:03:32.120 --> 1:03:35.800]  that exists in the natural world by the way this is this is a synthesized
[1:03:35.800 --> 1:03:41.040]  chemical sweetener and now the company see Monsanto sold off NutriSweet to a
[1:03:41.040 --> 1:03:46.760]  company called JW Childs or JW Childs equity partners they sold that off I
[1:03:46.760 --> 1:03:53.240]  believe right around 2000 or 2000 yeah 2000 I think 2002 and then neotame was
[1:03:53.240 --> 1:03:57.680]  approved by the FDA in 2002 and now that's being pushed very heavily and
[1:03:57.680 --> 1:04:02.080]  they're bragging about it the company says I'll hear it here's the quote from
[1:04:02.080 --> 1:04:06.560]  the company this is from the NutriSweet company they said we revolutionized the
[1:04:06.560 --> 1:04:12.560]  sweetener industry in 1981 with the introduction of aspartame and we intend
[1:04:12.560 --> 1:04:17.720]  to do it again with neotame when we receive approval from various
[1:04:17.720 --> 1:04:24.360]  regulatory agencies around the world so you see it is chemical sweetener
[1:04:24.360 --> 1:04:28.120]  imperialism you're going to start having neotame in all kinds of products but
[1:04:28.120 --> 1:04:34.280]  there's an internet myth about this that I have to cover you cannot put neotame
[1:04:34.280 --> 1:04:39.040]  in organic products it's not there's a myth out there that says you can it's
[1:04:39.040 --> 1:04:43.240]  not true we checked on it it's not true and neotame does have to be listed on
[1:04:43.240 --> 1:04:46.960]  the label as an additive so don't believe all those rumors about it but
[1:04:46.960 --> 1:04:50.800]  avoid this chemical no matter what stay with us we'll be right back here with
[1:04:50.800 --> 1:04:56.080]  Joe no body our guests coming up right after the break stay with us
[1:05:00.040 --> 1:05:04.400]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[1:05:04.400 --> 1:05:08.120]  non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you
[1:05:08.120 --> 1:05:11.680]  know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than
[1:05:11.680 --> 1:05:15.440]  silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in
[1:05:15.440 --> 1:05:19.320]  this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends and
[1:05:19.320 --> 1:05:23.760]  solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they
[1:05:23.760 --> 1:05:28.800]  call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[1:05:28.800 --> 1:05:32.520]  dense food for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have
[1:05:32.520 --> 1:05:36.320]  not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to
[1:05:36.320 --> 1:05:41.360]  plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survival seed bank comm
[1:05:41.360 --> 1:05:52.200]  that's survival seed bank comm or give them a call at 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365
[1:05:52.200 --> 1:05:57.760]  remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this
[1:05:57.760 --> 1:06:02.320]  is Alex Jones for survival seed bank comm I've been telling you about e-foods

[1:08:00.640 --> 1:08:08.760]  ease the T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:08:15.520 --> 1:08:21.600]  yeah we've got a great interview coming up with mr. Joe nobody that is his
[1:08:21.600 --> 1:08:26.600]  real alias that's his author name he's published numerous books under the name
[1:08:26.600 --> 1:08:31.560]  Joe nobody and let me just finish up one story that we were talking about before
[1:08:31.560 --> 1:08:36.120]  though neo tame this is the sweetener name that you need to know about to
[1:08:36.120 --> 1:08:42.120]  avoid it so get that into your head neo tame is the new aspartame it's the you
[1:08:42.120 --> 1:08:45.800]  know the second coming of aspartame to put it in the in the totally wrong
[1:08:45.800 --> 1:08:50.960]  context but avoid neo tame it's going to be marketed in much the same way it's
[1:08:50.960 --> 1:08:54.800]  going to be said that it's completely safe even though I think it's something
[1:08:54.800 --> 1:08:59.200]  like 30 times more potent than aspartame as a as a sweetener that's
[1:08:59.200 --> 1:09:04.920]  that's a guesstimate but there's a false internet rumor circulating that it
[1:09:04.920 --> 1:09:08.400]  can be used in organic foods and doesn't have to be listed on the label and
[1:09:08.400 --> 1:09:12.440]  that is completely false we checked it out we talked to the cornucopia Institute
[1:09:12.440 --> 1:09:16.520]  and they checked it out they said no if neo tame is in a food it's got to be
[1:09:16.520 --> 1:09:20.880]  listed on the label because it is an additive and it is not currently allowed
[1:09:20.880 --> 1:09:26.480]  under organic products you know sometimes sometimes I think I think there
[1:09:26.480 --> 1:09:29.440]  are some groups out there who are actually trying to spread a little
[1:09:29.440 --> 1:09:33.920]  disinformation sometimes I mean I mean look we all make mistakes from time to
[1:09:33.920 --> 1:09:37.800]  time and we've made mistakes as well and we correct them when we do you know
[1:09:37.800 --> 1:09:42.000]  info wars has made you know errors and corrected them but sometimes there are
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:45.600]  there are groups that make mistakes on purpose and then they try to spread that
[1:09:45.600 --> 1:09:51.960]  disinfo out there and that's not really appreciated so so you know do your
[1:09:51.960 --> 1:09:55.560]  homework on this stuff and and keep everybody honest out there hey if we
[1:09:55.560 --> 1:09:58.680]  make a mistake in natural news let me know too because you know we want to
[1:09:58.680 --> 1:10:02.160]  we want to keep our information accurate oh and by the way yeah if you just
[1:10:02.160 --> 1:10:06.200]  joined us this is this is Mike Adams filling in for Alex Jones today I'm the
[1:10:06.200 --> 1:10:10.240]  health ranger and Alex asked me to be here today he's on the road and he's
[1:10:10.240 --> 1:10:16.240]  also asked me to host next Monday and during that time we'll be having Jonathan
[1:10:16.240 --> 1:10:21.400]  E. Mord on as well as Dale Carson so we've got some good in good info coming
[1:10:21.400 --> 1:10:25.640]  up now right now let's go to Joe nobody let me give you a quick introduction of
[1:10:25.640 --> 1:10:29.960]  who this is obviously that's not his real name his real name must be kept
[1:10:29.960 --> 1:10:37.040]  secret because of his former experience let's I'll let him tell you what as much
[1:10:37.040 --> 1:10:41.520]  as he wants to tell you but he is a very well-informed individual who has
[1:10:41.520 --> 1:10:46.760]  operated outside the country yes he's an operator a former operator and an
[1:10:46.760 --> 1:10:52.520]  active teacher I have met him in person so I've checked him out and he's the real
[1:10:52.520 --> 1:10:56.000]  deal and he's got a lot of just really stunning information that you need to
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:59.200]  know because I think I think most of you would agree with me that that
[1:10:59.200 --> 1:11:02.920]  something's coming down the road this year maybe social collapse maybe
[1:11:02.920 --> 1:11:07.520]  economic collapse maybe some writing maybe some martial law crackdowns who
[1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:11.720]  knows what the case may be you need to get safe and this guy Joe nobody is
[1:11:11.720 --> 1:11:15.280]  going to teach you how to do it he's the author of this book holding your
[1:11:15.280 --> 1:11:21.520]  ground which you can find on amazon.com or other other booksellers you can see
[1:11:21.520 --> 1:11:25.120]  this copy as well-worn because it's my personal copy that I've been through and
[1:11:25.120 --> 1:11:29.960]  he joins us now by phone Joe are you with us hey good afternoon Mike how are
[1:11:29.960 --> 1:11:33.480]  you doing great Joe thank you for joining us today really appreciate you
[1:11:33.480 --> 1:11:38.480]  coming on the Alex Jones show well thank you for having me sir well let's get
[1:11:38.480 --> 1:11:43.640]  into it and don't hold back but let's start with as much as you can say on
[1:11:43.640 --> 1:11:48.240]  live national radio about your experience and background obviously protect
[1:11:48.240 --> 1:11:52.120]  your identity but what you know people want to know if you're really who you
[1:11:52.120 --> 1:11:57.720]  say you know if you're really qualified to talk about this well I won't go into
[1:11:57.720 --> 1:12:04.680]  operational details or history obviously most of the information in my books
[1:12:04.680 --> 1:12:10.840]  comes out of the private contracting world a lot of people don't know it in
[1:12:10.840 --> 1:12:16.600]  Iraq and Afghanistan and a lot of other places in the world guard duty if you
[1:12:16.600 --> 1:12:22.480]  will is now contracted out to private companies and there is a probably the
[1:12:22.480 --> 1:12:27.680]  best knowledge base about defending a location protecting assets things like
[1:12:27.680 --> 1:12:34.720]  that that are good for preppers people who prepare is probably the those
[1:12:34.720 --> 1:12:38.440]  individuals now are probably the most knowledgeable in the world about about
[1:12:38.440 --> 1:12:46.000]  those particular topics and we accessed as many of them as we could some of my
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:52.880]  own personal experiences in the books and we hope it helps people get their
[1:12:52.880 --> 1:12:58.200]  defense security situation in place well let's talk about that and I want to
[1:12:58.200 --> 1:13:03.160]  point out that your your book is not solely about you know build a bunker and
[1:13:03.160 --> 1:13:08.400]  stock with ammo and and spray and pray bullets everywhere because you know
[1:13:08.400 --> 1:13:13.680]  sometimes we sort of see that approach in the survival community you take a
[1:13:13.680 --> 1:13:19.760]  very I would say a wise very much a wiser approach to this can you talk
[1:13:19.760 --> 1:13:25.880]  about your philosophy of defense absolutely the best defense is stealth
[1:13:25.880 --> 1:13:32.760]  the best defense is hiding in plain sight there if there is a collapse of
[1:13:32.760 --> 1:13:39.320]  society if there is an event that occurs and there there's no longer rule of
[1:13:39.320 --> 1:13:44.760]  law the government's no longer protecting people the absolute best way to go
[1:13:44.760 --> 1:13:50.440]  about things is for no one to know where you are no one to know about your
[1:13:50.440 --> 1:13:58.160]  preparations and so we refer to that in the books as a passive profile you know
[1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:05.920]  versus an active profile is when you're making it very loud and clear that I'm
[1:14:05.920 --> 1:14:13.280]  well-armed I'm ready to defend myself and go away find an easier target and we
[1:14:13.280 --> 1:14:19.480]  try very hard in the books to allow people to prepare without damaging the
[1:14:19.480 --> 1:14:24.680]  value or the appearance or the usability of their property things like
[1:14:24.680 --> 1:14:31.160]  landscaping that you can do very non-Rambo type defensive measures what I
[1:14:31.160 --> 1:14:36.840]  also like about the information you you teach is it's usable in a city it's
[1:14:36.840 --> 1:14:40.640]  usable in a suburb and it's usable in the country you've got diagrams in your
[1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:47.640]  book you show fields of fire fields of being able to monitor other people you
[1:14:47.640 --> 1:14:52.040]  talk about having an area understanding what area you need to protect like your
[1:14:52.040 --> 1:14:56.400]  garden area to be able to harvest food or your livestock things like that can
[1:14:56.400 --> 1:15:03.400]  you talk about the the the wide range of applicability of what you teach well
[1:15:03.400 --> 1:15:11.920]  we obviously know two homes are the same and it is I think a lot of people do an
[1:15:11.920 --> 1:15:16.480]  excellent job of preparing they have their seeds their food sources their
[1:15:16.480 --> 1:15:22.640]  water sources various things like that defense tends to be lower on people's
[1:15:22.640 --> 1:15:28.480]  list I always tell the people that I teach and and mention a lot in the
[1:15:28.480 --> 1:15:34.000]  books the the biggest shortcoming or the biggest problem I see with most
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:40.520]  preparation is that folks are not ready for ultimate violence they are not
[1:15:40.520 --> 1:15:47.480]  ready for what desperate people hungry people who have no fear of punishment
[1:15:47.480 --> 1:15:53.960]  would be capable of doing and you don't have to go there you can study it you
[1:15:53.960 --> 1:15:58.960]  can read about it history is full of examples of this even some of them are
[1:15:58.960 --> 1:16:04.960]  going on currently Somalia for example we talk about quite a bit Bosnia
[1:16:04.960 --> 1:16:12.480]  Serbia even now in the Middle East there are certain areas of Egypt that I think
[1:16:12.480 --> 1:16:17.200]  communities or small groups of homes have banded together to protect
[1:16:17.200 --> 1:16:23.640]  themselves and if hunger is involved if there is a grid down situation in the
[1:16:23.640 --> 1:16:27.840]  food supply becomes critical people will get desperate well that's that's
[1:16:27.840 --> 1:16:32.080]  something that you really speak about and I talked about this in person let
[1:16:32.080 --> 1:16:36.480]  me ask you another thing about that but first let's let's crank up the the phone
[1:16:36.480 --> 1:16:41.280]  system I want to invite some callers to call in in the next segment to ask you
[1:16:41.280 --> 1:16:45.320]  some questions Joe if you're okay with taking some questions from some callers
[1:16:45.320 --> 1:16:49.720]  because I know people really have a lot of they're highly motivated to get
[1:16:49.720 --> 1:16:55.800]  information in this realm but let's talk about the the typical you you talked
[1:16:55.800 --> 1:17:00.160]  about how violent things could get or how quickly they could break down two
[1:17:00.160 --> 1:17:04.440]  questions for you one how thin really is the veneer of politeness in society
[1:17:04.440 --> 1:17:09.480]  today where people you know call 911 and wait for the cops to show up you know
[1:17:09.480 --> 1:17:14.760]  how I mean how fragile is that system really in your opinion well probably in
[1:17:14.760 --> 1:17:20.680]  the United States the most recent example that I I have studied quite in
[1:17:20.680 --> 1:17:26.680]  depth is New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and while the initial news
[1:17:26.680 --> 1:17:33.280]  stories coming out of the Superdome were greatly exaggerated it is a fact
[1:17:33.280 --> 1:17:37.840]  even today that a large percentage of the New Orleans Police Department either
[1:17:37.840 --> 1:17:44.920]  couldn't or didn't show up to work and in a natural disaster situation like
[1:17:44.920 --> 1:17:51.440]  that most people I think realize deep down inside the helpful becoming that
[1:17:51.440 --> 1:17:56.360]  eventually the police department the National Guard even federal troops will
[1:17:56.360 --> 1:18:01.840]  eventually be there to establish order and my experience with hurricanes along
[1:18:01.840 --> 1:18:07.480]  the Texas coast has been people initially band together there I refer to
[1:18:07.480 --> 1:18:14.160]  this period as a social grace period if the event is known to be national if the
[1:18:14.160 --> 1:18:20.080]  event is very widespread that period of social grace is not going to last very
[1:18:20.080 --> 1:18:25.600]  long one like three or four days maybe it would depend I think on the size of
[1:18:25.600 --> 1:18:32.240]  the community but it's not weak I do not believe at all that it would be more
[1:18:32.240 --> 1:18:36.120]  than a week or two at most all right what happens after the social graces in the
[1:18:36.120 --> 1:18:39.600]  societal politeness goes away what do you what do you start to see then well
[1:18:39.600 --> 1:18:44.600]  then you start seeing the breakdown of the small community groups that would
[1:18:44.600 --> 1:18:50.200]  have formed there would be challenges for leadership there would be vacuums in
[1:18:50.200 --> 1:18:55.880]  the rules those that are well prepared and have a large food supply might be
[1:18:55.880 --> 1:19:01.280]  pressured to share more than what they're comfortable with I'm a big
[1:19:01.280 --> 1:19:06.800]  believer in charity I'm a big believer in and helping out my fellow man but I
[1:19:06.800 --> 1:19:14.000]  also have to allow for my family survival and protect that and so then you
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:19.520]  would start to see I refer to it as bickery there you would also get the
[1:19:19.520 --> 1:19:24.080]  average American family according to several different statistics I believe
[1:19:24.080 --> 1:19:29.360]  the latest or freedom FEMA has about three to five days worth of food wow
[1:19:29.360 --> 1:19:37.160]  that's it that's it at at 10 days people are going to be very hungry in a
[1:19:37.160 --> 1:19:41.320]  grid-down situation your local grocery store is not going to get its truck
[1:19:41.320 --> 1:19:44.840]  Joe we got to go to break here sorry to cut you off but we're gonna continue with
[1:19:44.840 --> 1:19:47.880]  you on the other side of this break you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:19:47.880 --> 1:19:51.600]  an interview with Joe nobody stay with us we'll be right back after this break
[1:19:51.600 --> 1:20:04.840]  with a lot more a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into
[1:20:04.840 --> 1:20:08.560]  why even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my
[1:20:08.560 --> 1:20:12.880]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[1:20:12.880 --> 1:20:16.240]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[1:20:16.240 --> 1:20:20.840]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace
[1:20:20.840 --> 1:20:25.480]  elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be
[1:20:25.480 --> 1:20:30.200]  healthy I've been searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there

[1:24:09.120 --> 1:24:13.600]  tuned in to the Alex Jones show even though I'm not Alex obviously this is
[1:24:13.600 --> 1:24:19.400]  Mike Adams the health ranger filling in for Alex today and we're joined by a
[1:24:19.400 --> 1:24:24.760]  guest Joe nobody he's the author of this book holding your ground which is a
[1:24:24.760 --> 1:24:29.280]  strategic well a way to strategically look at your own house your own ranch
[1:24:29.280 --> 1:24:33.720]  your own property even in the city and keep yourself safe against anything that
[1:24:33.720 --> 1:24:38.000]  might happen and I think to continue with you Joe I'm a lot of people
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:42.160]  underestimate just what might happen and I'd like to kind of put you on the spot
[1:24:42.160 --> 1:24:45.880]  here with a with a little game if you don't mind this I mean this wasn't
[1:24:45.880 --> 1:24:50.400]  pre-arranged or anything so I apologize if I put you on the spot but how about I
[1:24:50.400 --> 1:24:55.120]  give you a scenario of a prepper and you tell me if you were a bad guy how you
[1:24:55.120 --> 1:25:00.280]  would beat it I'm good with that as long as I don't need a robotic
[1:25:00.280 --> 1:25:08.200]  place water yeah yeah you you heard the insect swarm of drones segment that we
[1:25:08.200 --> 1:25:15.840]  did in the last hour huh yeah for a while I just say wow leave it at that
[1:25:15.840 --> 1:25:19.800]  yeah they're gonna mass produce these things by the billions probably and by
[1:25:19.800 --> 1:25:23.960]  the way we will be taking calls for Joe nobody we've got callers on the line
[1:25:23.960 --> 1:25:30.040]  Candace Michelle Dave Darrell and more so we get to those calls shortly but let
[1:25:30.040 --> 1:25:33.800]  me give you a scenario a typical prepper let's say they've got they've got
[1:25:33.800 --> 1:25:37.720]  their stash in their house you know maybe some gold coins maybe some food
[1:25:37.720 --> 1:25:42.400]  maybe some ammo and you got you know grandpa is rocking in a rocking chair
[1:25:42.400 --> 1:25:46.560]  on the front porch with a shotgun and he thinks that he's safe how would you
[1:25:46.560 --> 1:25:55.320]  defeat that scenario Joe well first of all again underestimating distance is a
[1:25:55.320 --> 1:26:01.040]  big mistake and that particular scenario not that I ever would personally
[1:26:01.040 --> 1:26:06.960]  attack an occupied residence no you're you're speaking I want to be clear you
[1:26:06.960 --> 1:26:12.280]  are gonna describe what a bad guy would do to defeat that for the purpose of
[1:26:12.280 --> 1:26:19.120]  educating us to be safer thank you thank you for clarifying that anyway the
[1:26:19.120 --> 1:26:26.440]  occupants of the home would never see me I would be 300 600 900 yards away there
[1:26:26.440 --> 1:26:31.840]  is absolutely no reason if society has collapsed for me to take a risk of
[1:26:31.840 --> 1:26:39.480]  personal injury I'm probably very mobile I don't even need a huge rifle to be
[1:26:39.480 --> 1:26:44.720]  effective at that distance and the occupants would just literally never
[1:26:44.720 --> 1:26:49.600]  know I was there until it was too late even if they stayed inside of the home
[1:26:49.600 --> 1:26:57.600]  as we stress in the books walls do not stop bullets and bullets cause fires and
[1:26:57.600 --> 1:27:05.640]  so I'm going to use a distance-based attack probably if I have a team of
[1:27:05.640 --> 1:27:11.680]  desperados if you will I'm going to keep everybody's head down with distance
[1:27:11.680 --> 1:27:16.920]  based fire I'm gonna infel up the home we're not just going to walk up to the
[1:27:16.920 --> 1:27:23.280]  door and kick it in and go into a fatal funnel right we are going to come in for
[1:27:23.280 --> 1:27:28.320]  more than one side and in the meantime somebody at bed that you can't even see
[1:27:28.320 --> 1:27:33.600]  is keeping your head down now you say bullets start fires are you talking
[1:27:33.600 --> 1:27:37.440]  about incendiary rounds in particular that you would be that you know that a
[1:27:37.440 --> 1:27:44.000]  bad guy would be carrying no no not at all regular lead bullets start fires
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:52.080]  curtains burn very easily I tell the story and in the book that I used to
[1:27:52.080 --> 1:27:56.560]  live when I was a child I used to live next to an open landfill back in those
[1:27:56.560 --> 1:28:02.680]  days I'm probably aging myself there quite a bit and we it was a big Saturday
[1:28:02.680 --> 1:28:08.280]  morning activity to go down to the local dump we called it and target shoot
[1:28:08.280 --> 1:28:14.040]  and you would not believe the things that I've said on fire just with normal
[1:28:14.040 --> 1:28:19.440]  rounds out of a normal rifle that sounds like a really fun childhood well we
[1:28:19.440 --> 1:28:24.640]  had a good time wow out in the country it was that was pretty good entertainment
[1:28:24.640 --> 1:28:31.160]  and ammo was cheap back then so yes curtains burn very easily I've even
[1:28:31.160 --> 1:28:37.080]  caught on fire vacuum cleaners robotic toys we use as targets sometimes in our
[1:28:37.080 --> 1:28:43.840]  classes it's really not hard to set common household items on fire from
[1:28:43.840 --> 1:28:47.440]  bullets also you do use these robots huh so you know what we're talking about
[1:28:47.440 --> 1:28:52.000]  what do you have little terminators out there that that you shoot I go to to
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:58.640]  Radio Shack and get a remote control toy and drill a hole in the side and put a
[1:28:58.640 --> 1:29:03.680]  co-hanger in it blow up some balloons and boy they make a great training target
[1:29:03.680 --> 1:29:09.520]  you get somebody a little crafty on the remote control ziggin and zagging it
[1:29:09.520 --> 1:29:14.760]  around and it's a good training aid okay wow a lot more great information coming
[1:29:14.760 --> 1:29:17.920]  here from Joe nobody folks we got to go to a break shortly but we're gonna come
[1:29:17.920 --> 1:29:22.360]  this is this was a short segment we'll be back after this break with more and
[1:29:22.360 --> 1:29:25.840]  Joe I've got more scenarios for you I'm gonna give you some challenges and you
[1:29:25.840 --> 1:29:30.880]  tell us how the bad guys would defeat someone who thinks they're defended who
[1:29:30.880 --> 1:29:34.600]  thinks they're prepared who thinks they're safe and again this is for
[1:29:34.600 --> 1:29:39.880]  educational purposes only to help law abiding citizens stay safe in uncertain
[1:29:39.880 --> 1:29:42.760]  times stay with us here on the Alex Jones show this is Mike Adams the
[1:29:42.760 --> 1:29:46.280]  health ranger we'll be right back
[1:29:46.280 --> 1:29:56.400]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[1:29:56.400 --> 1:30:05.560]  network a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even
[1:30:05.560 --> 1:30:09.120]  if I had a pretty good size meal that I was still starving and my research led
[1:30:09.120 --> 1:30:13.640]  me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in
[1:30:13.640 --> 1:30:16.600]  the United States and across the industrialized world are almost
[1:30:16.600 --> 1:30:21.760]  completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that
[1:30:21.760 --> 1:30:26.360]  our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then
[1:30:26.360 --> 1:30:31.160]  searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[1:31:21.200 --> 1:31:25.320]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[1:31:25.320 --> 1:31:29.840]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[1:31:29.840 --> 1:31:33.960]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[1:31:33.960 --> 1:31:37.960]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[1:33:14.520 --> 1:33:20.280]  self-defense but not just with bullets and firearms but things that you can do
[1:33:20.280 --> 1:33:24.520]  to even for example you can make your house look like it's already been looted
[1:33:24.520 --> 1:33:29.840]  and burned out so that people pass it on by in the case of a society collapse
[1:33:29.840 --> 1:33:33.560]  even if it's a short-term collapse you know a few weeks is all it hey a few
[1:33:33.560 --> 1:33:37.320]  days is all it takes for someone to loot your home and harm your family so
[1:33:37.320 --> 1:33:41.560]  we're all about safety we want especially we want info wars listeners to be safe
[1:33:41.560 --> 1:33:46.040]  to be well informed to be well prepared and that's why we've got Joe nobody on
[1:33:46.040 --> 1:33:51.040]  as a guest today Joe we were talking about some scenarios are you ready for
[1:33:51.040 --> 1:33:55.160]  another one absolutely hit me all right so the context here again for the
[1:33:55.160 --> 1:33:58.480]  listeners is I'm going to give Joe a scenario of a typical prepper and he's
[1:33:58.480 --> 1:34:02.160]  going to think like a bad guy and tell us how he would defeat that scenario and
[1:34:02.160 --> 1:34:07.880]  you know take you out and take your stuff so let's say you have this is in a
[1:34:07.880 --> 1:34:13.720]  suburban area a suburb so you've got a family that refuses to come out of their
[1:34:13.720 --> 1:34:17.640]  house you know they've got food you know they've got medical supplies you know
[1:34:17.640 --> 1:34:22.480]  they've got water filters and gold let's say they refuse to come out but you the
[1:34:22.480 --> 1:34:25.360]  bad guy you want to get them out and you want to get their stuff how do you how
[1:34:25.360 --> 1:34:32.440]  would you do it option one burn them out at least smoke them out option to take
[1:34:32.440 --> 1:34:39.640]  a vehicle and just drive it through the front door that is ultimate violence
[1:34:39.640 --> 1:34:46.800]  it's a technique that our troops started using in Iraq on very heavily steel
[1:34:46.800 --> 1:34:54.760]  gated steel door adobe homes they would drive a Humvee or a striker up and they
[1:34:54.760 --> 1:35:01.000]  would just push on the door with the the the front bumper in a post-collapse
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:05.440]  situation I'm not worried about my car insurance I probably have picked up the
[1:35:05.440 --> 1:35:11.560]  car down the street anyway it's probably not even mine and they won't come out
[1:35:11.560 --> 1:35:16.240]  the area is too open for us to try to cross to try to get them out any other
[1:35:16.240 --> 1:35:20.160]  way driver car through the front door see this is why I like talking to you Joe
[1:35:20.160 --> 1:35:25.320]  because you're creative in a kind of a wicked kind of way but the reason this
[1:35:25.320 --> 1:35:29.840]  is important is because most Americans are polite people most Americans are
[1:35:29.840 --> 1:35:34.120]  good people they tend to follow the rules they tend to think I'm not gonna
[1:35:34.120 --> 1:35:38.560]  bash in my neighbor's front door I'm not gonna you know snipe and kill some
[1:35:38.560 --> 1:35:42.440]  innocent person and you know thank thank God that most Americans are polite and
[1:35:42.440 --> 1:35:47.240]  are good people with good hearts but that can also blind people can't it
[1:35:47.240 --> 1:35:52.000]  because they don't they don't fully grasp the level of violence that other
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:56.440]  people without those morals and ethics can resort to correct oh absolutely
[1:35:56.440 --> 1:36:03.040]  another example is kidnapping if you go to the parts of the world where society
[1:36:03.040 --> 1:36:09.120]  has broken down you will find that kidnapping is an industry look at the
[1:36:09.120 --> 1:36:14.920]  Somalia pirates and it doesn't even have to be foreign assets or foreign people
[1:36:14.920 --> 1:36:21.000]  look at all of the ransoms that were paid in Iraq after the fall of Saddam
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:26.760]  kidnapping becomes a barter system almost in some of these very troubled
[1:36:26.760 --> 1:36:33.360]  spots in the world and yet when I talk to preppers and I say okay how are you
[1:36:33.360 --> 1:36:36.960]  gonna get food oh well there's an orchard we're gonna send the kids out
[1:36:36.960 --> 1:36:41.640]  there's an apple orchard and we're gonna collect apples oh yeah if your kids go
[1:36:41.640 --> 1:36:46.080]  out and they're not protected they're at risk and what would you give to get
[1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:52.200]  your child back right well I'm glad you're pointing these things out although
[1:36:52.200 --> 1:36:56.520]  it's horrifying to consider these possible scenarios let me ask you one
[1:36:56.520 --> 1:37:00.240]  more scenario though and then we'll go to the callers who are waiting to ask you
[1:37:00.240 --> 1:37:05.880]  questions let's say that you've got a ranch out in the country with three or
[1:37:05.880 --> 1:37:10.200]  four well armed individuals who are brandishing their firearms they're
[1:37:10.200 --> 1:37:15.320]  they're doing patrols they they appear to be well protected how would you and a
[1:37:15.320 --> 1:37:21.000]  small team of bad guys assess and then try to attack that situation well
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:28.400]  obviously the first choice would be to try to pull them out some sort of not a
[1:37:28.400 --> 1:37:34.200]  diversion but some sort of bait to pull them out if they're experienced and they
[1:37:34.200 --> 1:37:40.000]  maybe have read some of the books they wouldn't fall for that so then you're
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:46.600]  into a situation where you do and again what I call an enveloping attack you fake
[1:37:46.600 --> 1:37:52.320]  an attack at one direction your primary your major force hits the area from a
[1:37:52.320 --> 1:37:58.840]  secondary direction works over time and you've you've seen this you've
[1:37:58.840 --> 1:38:03.280]  experienced this in person or you've talked to soldiers who have done this in
[1:38:03.280 --> 1:38:09.600]  person or it's a it's a commonly known infantry tactic for those who haven't
[1:38:09.600 --> 1:38:15.440]  served an enveloping attack anybody that spent any time behind a rifle knows
[1:38:15.440 --> 1:38:21.920]  exactly what I'm talking about defenders always typically have an
[1:38:21.920 --> 1:38:27.080]  advantage for several different reasons don't want to bore your audience to death
[1:38:27.080 --> 1:38:32.400]  with all the reasons but typically an attacking force needs to outnumber a
[1:38:32.400 --> 1:38:39.320]  defending force about five to one as the general rule and so attacking forces
[1:38:39.320 --> 1:38:47.880]  have to develop some pretty nifty methods tactics to be able to overcome a
[1:38:47.880 --> 1:38:54.240]  defensive group and enveloping attacks is one of the most common how how bad a
[1:38:54.240 --> 1:38:59.520]  shape are people in who go out and buy a firearm and never shoot it they put it
[1:38:59.520 --> 1:39:04.720]  on a shelf they have a box of ammo they own a firearm but again they've never
[1:39:04.720 --> 1:39:08.440]  used it they think they're protected I mean how how bad a shape are they in
[1:39:08.440 --> 1:39:15.160]  tactically well it's I will you know on a scale of 1 to 10 the person who has no
[1:39:15.160 --> 1:39:21.000]  firearm no intent at all of defending themselves is at the lower end of the
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:25.160]  scale obviously someone who has a firearm even if they've had no practice
[1:39:25.160 --> 1:39:30.080]  with it is a little bit better but almost as bad as not having a weapon at
[1:39:30.080 --> 1:39:37.000]  all there is fear there is adrenaline there is confusion in a situation when
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:41.480]  you are attacked I always tell my students when I get very scared and I
[1:39:41.480 --> 1:39:49.560]  have been very scared I hide behind my weapon and it's just natural human
[1:39:49.560 --> 1:39:54.800]  instinct to do that so I always tell people you don't have to be a
[1:39:54.800 --> 1:39:58.440]  competitive shooter you don't have to go out and spend thousands and thousands
[1:39:58.440 --> 1:40:02.680]  of dollars you don't have to be like me I shoot two or three thousand rounds a
[1:40:02.680 --> 1:40:08.560]  month I also have to reload my own ammunition we shoot so much and you
[1:40:08.560 --> 1:40:14.720]  don't have to do that get some training go to a class by a book go to a range a
[1:40:14.720 --> 1:40:20.280]  couple times learn the basics of your firearm there are just an infinite
[1:40:20.280 --> 1:40:25.200]  number of good sources of training and materials out there all right good good
[1:40:25.200 --> 1:40:28.800]  advice from Joe nobody the author of all these books that we've been talking
[1:40:28.800 --> 1:40:32.320]  about also want to mention to that you know some people hear this in the wrong
[1:40:32.320 --> 1:40:37.120]  context they think it's you know these these lone wolf Rambo types who are
[1:40:37.120 --> 1:40:42.120]  gonna you know destroy law and order no these are the guys who are actually
[1:40:42.120 --> 1:40:46.520]  going to be assisting local sheriffs and local deputies in re-establishing law
[1:40:46.520 --> 1:40:51.520]  and order in my experience I mean to to keep the roads safe to keep the looters
[1:40:51.520 --> 1:40:55.120]  out of people's homes and out of communities I mean would you agree with
[1:40:55.120 --> 1:40:58.520]  that Joe that these are really the law abiding citizens who want to re-establish
[1:40:58.520 --> 1:41:05.240]  law oh absolutely and your your the fewer homes that your local sheriffs
[1:41:05.240 --> 1:41:12.080]  department your local law enforcement has to worry about the fewer folks who are
[1:41:12.080 --> 1:41:18.520]  in a situation of desperation the more they can focus their limited resources
[1:41:18.520 --> 1:41:23.000]  on helping the people that that you know maybe didn't prepare or maybe in a
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:27.080]  worse situation exactly well said we're gonna go to some callers now who I'm
[1:41:27.080 --> 1:41:30.880]  sure have some interesting questions for you and perhaps your childhood
[1:41:30.880 --> 1:41:39.400]  gonna Candice in Tennessee you're on the air go ahead with a question please can
[1:41:39.400 --> 1:41:44.240]  you hear us Candice yes can you hear me yeah go ahead you're on the air okay I
[1:41:44.240 --> 1:41:49.280]  mean I just had a question for Joe and I'm a mother of three small children and
[1:41:49.280 --> 1:41:54.360]  I was just wondering what his advice would be on preparing and surviving a
[1:41:54.360 --> 1:42:00.480]  collab with having small children well Candice I appreciate you calling in
[1:42:00.480 --> 1:42:07.880]  small children present a unique problem for preppers and there's it's more than
[1:42:07.880 --> 1:42:14.400]  just food and clothing there is a noise discipline issue if I'm a bad guy if
[1:42:14.400 --> 1:42:19.640]  things aren't going very well occupying the children keeping them quiet as much
[1:42:19.640 --> 1:42:25.240]  as possible I have had small children myself I know that's not always maybe
[1:42:25.240 --> 1:42:32.000]  something you can control but noise discipline with kids especially becomes
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:36.960]  important because a bad guy is going to be listening a bad guy is going to be
[1:42:36.960 --> 1:42:43.000]  up in a tree perhaps trying to observe a large area the best method I have seen
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:48.920]  for that is if you can limit the visibility into your backyard into the
[1:42:48.920 --> 1:42:52.880]  area where the children you've got to let them outside they've got to get outside
[1:42:52.880 --> 1:42:57.440]  to play every now and then that sort of thing try to limit the visibility and
[1:42:57.440 --> 1:43:02.800]  especially at night try to keep them as quiet as possible that's good
[1:43:02.800 --> 1:43:07.120]  information Joe you cover some of that in in your teaching material I like the
[1:43:07.120 --> 1:43:11.560]  fact that you you recommend things like planting trees planting bushes using
[1:43:11.560 --> 1:43:15.440]  round bales of hay you know like we have in Texas and throughout much of the
[1:43:15.440 --> 1:43:20.480]  country the big round bales they can they can block fields of view and help
[1:43:20.480 --> 1:43:24.800]  protect areas that you need to keep safe let's go on to another caller Michelle
[1:43:24.800 --> 1:43:33.680]  from South Carolina you're on the air with Joe nobody hello hi my question is
[1:43:33.680 --> 1:43:38.200]  about protecting a garden we recently moved to South Carolina
[1:43:38.200 --> 1:43:43.640]  into a rental and we're going to put in a fairly large garden our backyard is
[1:43:43.640 --> 1:43:48.840]  about two acres I guess and we have it staked out in the middle of the yard
[1:43:48.840 --> 1:43:53.960]  because that gets the best sun I'm wondering it is kind of out in the
[1:43:53.960 --> 1:43:58.120]  open all the houses around us can can see it I'm wondering how can we protect
[1:43:58.120 --> 1:44:02.840]  that if need be good question well there are a couple of different methods and
[1:44:02.840 --> 1:44:07.760]  again thank you for your question there are a couple of different methods that
[1:44:07.760 --> 1:44:15.760]  I recommend in the book the blocking visibility clear visibility is is one
[1:44:15.760 --> 1:44:21.480]  of the critical elements of hiding in plain sight there are for example you
[1:44:21.480 --> 1:44:28.760]  can buy a very large Army surplus camouflage net and string it up between
[1:44:28.760 --> 1:44:35.720]  two trees or string it up you know between two light poles or some method of
[1:44:35.720 --> 1:44:42.400]  getting it up in the air and yes it may look odd that there's a net hanging
[1:44:42.400 --> 1:44:47.880]  there I don't know your neighborhood or your community but anyway that you can
[1:44:47.880 --> 1:44:55.160]  block visibility I is a rogue starving desperate soul and not going to come
[1:44:55.160 --> 1:45:01.400]  after something I can't see and that's such a key part of preparing hiding in
[1:45:01.400 --> 1:45:05.840]  plain sight a good good answer though Joe did you have a follow-up question
[1:45:05.840 --> 1:45:13.480]  Michelle um actually yeah I did real quick I've been wondering where is the
[1:45:13.480 --> 1:45:19.160]  best place to put my food supply I do have a room off the garage which you
[1:45:19.160 --> 1:45:23.520]  know anybody will look at I'm wondering should I put it up in the attic or it's
[1:45:23.520 --> 1:45:29.640]  going to get hot up there what do you say Joe yeah for my home personally we
[1:45:29.640 --> 1:45:35.520]  keep our emergency food supply and Tupperware bins and for my home personally
[1:45:35.520 --> 1:45:42.720]  they're going in one of the bathtubs and the reason why for that is typically a
[1:45:42.720 --> 1:45:49.560]  bathroom has less windows in it than other parts of the home I like the the
[1:45:49.560 --> 1:45:56.120]  bathtub storage if you will for for variety of different reasons and so our
[1:45:56.120 --> 1:45:59.440]  plan has always been we fill up the bathtubs with water if we think an
[1:45:59.440 --> 1:46:02.920]  event's going to occur yeah like a hurricane we live in hurricane country
[1:46:02.920 --> 1:46:07.720]  as soon as the first bathtub on the internal bathroom is empty then the
[1:46:07.720 --> 1:46:13.120]  food storage goes in there a central part of the house is the most important
[1:46:13.120 --> 1:46:17.280]  part all right so yeah people can't get in and out very easily makes complete
[1:46:17.280 --> 1:46:21.520]  sense we've got another caller Dave from Pennsylvania you're on the air with Joe
[1:46:21.520 --> 1:46:30.720]  nobody go ahead please Dave are you there okay I think we I think we've lost
[1:46:30.720 --> 1:46:35.600]  Dave let's go to Daryl in Texas Daryl you're on the air go ahead good evening
[1:46:35.600 --> 1:46:41.280]  gentlemen or good afternoon I have a couple questions first I guess in a
[1:46:41.280 --> 1:46:45.880]  situation like that is it this case that you would really never be able to put
[1:46:45.880 --> 1:46:50.200]  they put on any type of land that you had or acreage and you would be best
[1:46:50.200 --> 1:46:56.120]  mobile I guess my question is what is the best way high surf survivability to
[1:46:56.120 --> 1:47:01.120]  approach such an event like that and maybe any books that you have you could
[1:47:01.120 --> 1:47:04.720]  recommend and one final thing is how do we take steps to put this thing together
[1:47:04.720 --> 1:47:08.760]  help the local sheriff's in that sort of thing and sort of foster that type of
[1:47:08.760 --> 1:47:18.720]  thing okay see if I can take those one at a time I always I always stress to
[1:47:18.720 --> 1:47:24.520]  people both in the books and and what I'm doing this in person that population
[1:47:24.520 --> 1:47:30.920]  density is a critical factor on bug in versus bug out is what the prepper
[1:47:30.920 --> 1:47:35.800]  community kind of refers to that bug in is I'm going to shoulder in place
[1:47:35.800 --> 1:47:42.920]  batten down the hatches I'm in the LMO bug out is I have an alternate retreat
[1:47:42.920 --> 1:47:49.880]  a cousin's home in the country a favorite campsite to tell my RV to whatever
[1:47:49.880 --> 1:47:56.200]  and so a critical part of any preparer's decision on that and and we all
[1:47:56.200 --> 1:48:01.520]  struggle with that decision no one wants to leave their home but if you're in an
[1:48:01.520 --> 1:48:06.680]  area where there is a heavy population density a major city even a middle-sized
[1:48:06.680 --> 1:48:13.040]  city it's very difficult to think that you're going to hold your home your
[1:48:13.040 --> 1:48:19.200]  hold your ground as we say for an extended period of time people will be
[1:48:19.200 --> 1:48:26.600]  the problem and so that's you ask if it's possible at all yes it is in a
[1:48:26.600 --> 1:48:31.200]  rural community with good preps you can be very very hard to push off of your
[1:48:31.200 --> 1:48:37.560]  land and the so then the second question is hope I answered the first is any
[1:48:37.560 --> 1:48:43.080]  books that we would recommend there are a other than my books that I've written
[1:48:43.080 --> 1:48:50.040]  there are a variety of Army manuals that are out there the there's a lot of
[1:48:50.040 --> 1:48:55.000]  authors James Wesley Rawls has a very good book how to survive the underworld
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:49:01.360]  as we know it it's considered a classic I guess or a staple of most preparer's
[1:49:01.360 --> 1:49:07.720]  libraries so you go out to Amazon do a search go to an Army surplus store look
[1:49:07.720 --> 1:49:11.560]  through the manuals that they have there the ones that would apply I'll give you
[1:49:11.560 --> 1:49:16.600]  a hint look at the Army Corps of Engineers manuals before defensive
[1:49:16.600 --> 1:49:21.880]  preparations were contracted out to private companies in the last 15 years
[1:49:21.880 --> 1:49:25.720]  it was actually the Corps of Engineers that was responsible for most base
[1:49:25.720 --> 1:49:32.240]  security and then the third question I don't remember I think the third question
[1:49:32.240 --> 1:49:37.720]  was how do we tie it all together how do we really put all this in place I I
[1:49:37.720 --> 1:49:44.280]  I'm sorry yes and working with the local law thank you Mike yeah I don't
[1:49:44.280 --> 1:49:50.880]  approach my local sheriff I don't coordinate with local law enforcement
[1:49:50.880 --> 1:49:56.440]  unless I meet them at shooting events or competitions which a lot of people are
[1:49:56.440 --> 1:50:02.040]  not going to get into if there is an event if there is a breakdown they will
[1:50:02.040 --> 1:50:08.720]  figure out very very quickly who's preparing who is confident who has a
[1:50:08.720 --> 1:50:14.520]  problem and who doesn't and you know maybe if you're friends with the local
[1:50:14.520 --> 1:50:20.720]  deputy or constable maybe if you have a relationship or a family relationship just
[1:50:20.720 --> 1:50:24.480]  mentioned hey we're preparing we're storing up some food we're storing up
[1:50:24.480 --> 1:50:29.280]  some medical supplies no matter no matter how bad it gets we intend on staying
[1:50:29.280 --> 1:50:34.240]  here and Joe we gotta we got to go to a break here I want to give out the 800
[1:50:34.240 --> 1:50:41.800]  number also from callers 800 259 92 31 we will take more calls with Joe nobody
[1:50:41.800 --> 1:50:45.880]  on the other side of this break sorry to interrupt you there Joe I'm sure people
[1:50:45.880 --> 1:50:50.200]  are really digging this information so it's a lot more straight ahead on the
[1:50:50.200 --> 1:50:54.200]  other side here on the Alex Jones show don't go away we'll be right back with
[1:50:54.200 --> 1:50:56.440]  more

[1:51:09.560 --> 1:51:13.960]  starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins and as soon as I
[1:51:13.960 --> 1:51:18.840]  had that I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be

[1:55:11.120 --> 1:55:16.280]  a quick update when he's available but go ahead the scenarios that we were
[1:55:16.280 --> 1:55:19.560]  talking about seem very realistic to people but I think a lot of people are
[1:55:19.560 --> 1:55:25.680]  shocked at some of what you came up with it is this just because you've seen
[1:55:25.680 --> 1:55:31.640]  this stuff happen or how is it that you have this understanding of you know the
[1:55:31.640 --> 1:55:35.040]  bad guys can get really crazy and really violent really quickly where this
[1:55:35.040 --> 1:55:43.440]  information come from well again most of the security of people even the
[1:55:43.440 --> 1:55:50.520]  American Army generals are typically guarded or protected went on foreign
[1:55:50.520 --> 1:56:00.320]  soiled by private contractors and there is a vast database of knowledge out
[1:56:00.320 --> 1:56:05.580]  there but for example the what I was talking about earlier with the
[1:56:05.580 --> 1:56:09.680]  suburban home and just driving a vehicle through the front door I think
[1:56:09.680 --> 1:56:15.280]  everybody remembers that horrific event with the Marines and Beirut in the
[1:56:15.280 --> 1:56:23.120]  1980s right and what a lesson everybody learned it was a real eye-opener for
[1:56:23.120 --> 1:56:28.280]  for all of the professionals out there and in any branch of the service or
[1:56:28.280 --> 1:56:36.520]  government service or any of the alphabet agencies or anything and so it's
[1:56:36.520 --> 1:56:45.240]  really a combined database of knowledge Joe I apologize for interrupting I got
[1:56:45.240 --> 1:56:49.160]  a past I gotta put you on hold right now these days with the internet with the

[2:00:30.920 --> 2:00:36.040]  interview with Joe nobody who I must apologize to for cutting him off there in
[2:00:36.040 --> 2:00:41.440]  the last segment we got a call in from Adam Kokesh was live on the the March
[2:00:41.440 --> 2:00:45.480]  right now 400 plus veterans are marching on the White House right now to
[2:00:45.480 --> 2:00:51.320]  support Ron Paul for president that's Adam Kokesh of course who is himself a
[2:00:51.320 --> 2:00:55.000]  veteran and and he held up the phone there and announced that he's live on
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:00:59.160]  the air with info wars and they got a great round of applause so we want to
[2:00:59.160 --> 2:01:02.920]  support all those veterans I'm sure that Curt Nimmo is probably going to be
[2:01:02.920 --> 2:01:07.600]  looking at writing a follow-up story on the results of that March and I hope to
[2:01:07.600 --> 2:01:11.480]  hear from Adam to potentially cover that on natural news as well we all want to
[2:01:11.480 --> 2:01:15.640]  support these veterans and Ron Paul of course now continuing with Joe nobody
[2:01:15.640 --> 2:01:20.520]  didn't mean to cut you off there Joe but such as the nature of live radio were
[2:01:20.520 --> 2:01:22.760]  there any final thoughts you want to finish up are you ready to take another
[2:01:22.760 --> 2:01:27.080]  call we're ready for another call all right let's go to the name I have on
[2:01:27.080 --> 2:01:30.520]  the screen is Boron from Alabama I guess that will be an elemental question
[2:01:30.520 --> 2:01:39.320]  right yeah my name is Boron I'm sorry okay yeah I'm the founder of WTF
[2:01:39.320 --> 2:01:44.160]  rly.com I've actually posted a couple of your articles and I have two
[2:01:44.160 --> 2:01:49.240]  specific questions about you know ongoing preparedness the first is what you
[2:01:49.240 --> 2:01:55.560]  think about as far as food and it relates to not just so-called beans and
[2:01:55.560 --> 2:02:00.080]  whatnot but the all types of powders that are out there like young Jamity all
[2:02:00.080 --> 2:02:03.640]  these products what do you think about that as far as ongoing preparedness and
[2:02:03.640 --> 2:02:07.640]  also about if you're having to cook what do you think about actually your
[2:02:07.640 --> 2:02:12.320]  place on the fire you know near your camp you know people will be able to smell it
[2:02:12.320 --> 2:02:18.640]  be it you know what do you think about the ongoing okay great questions Boron
[2:02:18.640 --> 2:02:22.080]  sorry about mispronounce your name there Joe why don't you go ahead and take the
[2:02:22.080 --> 2:02:28.560]  campfire question then I'll handle the nutrition question sure fire and smoke
[2:02:28.560 --> 2:02:39.400]  is always a risky proposition it there are some experts who believe that after
[2:02:39.400 --> 2:02:44.400]  a collapse fires especially around urban areas of homes because there won't be a
[2:02:44.400 --> 2:02:48.560]  fire department there won't be water pressure there won't be very many ways
[2:02:48.560 --> 2:02:52.920]  to fight a fire that fires are going to be very common so seeing smoke on the
[2:02:52.920 --> 2:02:58.440]  horizon might be something that the people ignore out other people believe
[2:02:58.440 --> 2:03:04.880]  that you should never use any type of smoke generating wood very dry wood
[2:03:04.880 --> 2:03:09.320]  there's a typically a lot of materials in most geographic regions that generate
[2:03:09.320 --> 2:03:16.360]  very little smoke my advice to people is always try out try things out try
[2:03:16.360 --> 2:03:21.160]  different materials to burn and see what generates smoke and see what doesn't
[2:03:21.160 --> 2:03:25.720]  the other thing that I always teach people is if you are going to do a fire
[2:03:25.720 --> 2:03:30.440]  if you're gonna start a fire you need to set up a perimeter you don't want to be
[2:03:30.440 --> 2:03:36.000]  surprised surprises always the worst thing and Mike you're better qualified
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:40.480]  on the food question okay well keep it short there are a lot of superfood
[2:03:40.480 --> 2:03:45.080]  powders that do store for a year or two inner food being among them many others
[2:03:45.080 --> 2:03:48.800]  but if you really want to be prepared you've got to get into sprouting that's
[2:03:48.800 --> 2:03:52.600]  my opinion get some sprouting seeds and a sprouting tray you can even just use a
[2:03:52.600 --> 2:03:58.200]  jar with a special lid or even a small bucket or a canister of some kind all
[2:03:58.200 --> 2:04:01.600]  you need is water and seeds and you can grow your own nutrition in an emergency
[2:04:01.600 --> 2:04:05.640]  situation without even going outdoors so it's a really important skill to learn
[2:04:05.640 --> 2:04:10.400]  now Joe nobody has been our guest he's the author of Holding Your Ground he's
[2:04:10.400 --> 2:04:17.440]  also the author of what what what was the book that we just showed there yeah

[2:06:01.680 --> 2:06:06.200]  year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good
[2:06:06.200 --> 2:06:10.400]  size meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact
[2:06:10.400 --> 2:06:14.480]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and
[2:06:14.480 --> 2:06:18.480]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost
[2:06:18.480 --> 2:06:23.360]  all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild
[2:06:23.360 --> 2:06:27.720]  themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then searched out the best

[2:08:28.560 --> 2:08:35.120]  Monday the 27th of February when we'll have Jonathan emorde on he's the author
[2:08:35.120 --> 2:08:38.560]  of a new book called restoring I believe it's called restoring the republic
[2:08:38.560 --> 2:08:44.560]  with a forward written by Ron Paul we also will have Dale Carson on who I
[2:08:44.560 --> 2:08:47.840]  mistakenly thought was gonna be on today but he's gonna be on next week and
[2:08:47.840 --> 2:08:50.640]  which is even better because you saw all the news we had to cover today we
[2:08:50.640 --> 2:08:54.400]  still have more to get to in fact and then coming up shortly in a few minutes
[2:08:54.400 --> 2:08:59.360]  we're going to be joined by dr. Sheldon marks a microsurgeon and a
[2:08:59.360 --> 2:09:03.680]  urologist who has all kinds of great information about medical preparedness
[2:09:03.680 --> 2:09:08.720]  emergency medicine if you have questions for dr. marks go ahead and call on in
[2:09:08.720 --> 2:09:15.840]  we've got the the call-in line here at 1-800-259-9231 and those of you who are
[2:09:15.840 --> 2:09:21.680]  already on the line Barney Jared Rio and more if you have questions for dr.
[2:09:21.680 --> 2:09:25.840]  marks we will be getting to you in the next few minutes to get those questions
[2:09:25.840 --> 2:09:30.160]  answered now you'll notice a lot of the information today is focused on
[2:09:30.160 --> 2:09:34.000]  preparedness that's because time is growing short you know you see the
[2:09:34.000 --> 2:09:37.040]  writing on the wall you see the red flags out there you know that we've got
[2:09:37.040 --> 2:09:41.440]  to stay prepared or we're going to suffer some well potentially suffer
[2:09:41.440 --> 2:09:44.560]  some consequences we don't we don't know what's coming down the road but we do
[2:09:44.560 --> 2:09:46.720]  know it's smart and wise to be prepared
[2:09:46.720 --> 2:09:52.080]  but have you ever noticed that now the very acts of preparedness are being
[2:09:52.080 --> 2:09:56.720]  called almost like terrorism well how dare you buy extra food and store food
[2:09:56.720 --> 2:10:01.360]  how dare you go to a military surplus store and buy some equipment to keep
[2:10:01.360 --> 2:10:05.680]  yourself safe and prepared how dare you use cash or buy gold
[2:10:05.680 --> 2:10:09.360]  or buy silver these things will only crazy people do that
[2:10:09.360 --> 2:10:12.560]  or only radical people or maybe only terrorists
[2:10:12.560 --> 2:10:16.800]  but then you learn well the government's preparing
[2:10:16.800 --> 2:10:21.040]  and in a huge way too not a small way the government is preparing in a massive
[2:10:21.040 --> 2:10:25.520]  way and they have been for decades the government has spent hundreds of
[2:10:25.520 --> 2:10:30.720]  billions of dollars creating these cave systems and i i'm from
[2:10:30.720 --> 2:10:33.200]  Missouri and i used to drive by these caves in
[2:10:33.200 --> 2:10:36.320]  Kansas City they're they're just carved right out of limestone
[2:10:36.320 --> 2:10:40.800]  caves you can drive an 18-wheeler tractor trailer right into them
[2:10:40.800 --> 2:10:43.680]  and they drive in and out of there all day long you used to be able to see them
[2:10:43.680 --> 2:10:46.000]  right from the highway i don't know if you still can
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:49.760]  but they have massive amounts of supplies in there for government
[2:10:49.760 --> 2:10:54.080]  so they've got the food they've got the medicine they've got the firearms the
[2:10:54.080 --> 2:10:57.520]  security the communications the water filters
[2:10:57.520 --> 2:11:01.280]  you know all these things seed banks to to restart and regrow gardens and you
[2:11:01.280 --> 2:11:04.320]  can bet those are not genetically modified seeds
[2:11:04.320 --> 2:11:07.920]  because they know they need to be able to grow them generation after generation
[2:11:07.920 --> 2:11:12.960]  so it brings up the question why is it okay for government to prepare
[2:11:12.960 --> 2:11:17.840]  but not you and me what's up with that
[2:11:17.840 --> 2:11:21.840]  is it should the government be the only entity that survives
[2:11:21.840 --> 2:11:24.720]  a disaster is that the message that we're being sent
[2:11:24.720 --> 2:11:30.240]  oh you little people you you vaccine injected little gmo consuming
[2:11:30.240 --> 2:11:34.400]  miscreant sheeple people you all are expendable
[2:11:34.400 --> 2:11:38.880]  don't prepare don't have any food in your pantry don't read books that teach you
[2:11:38.880 --> 2:11:41.920]  basic preparedness no you're all expendable but the
[2:11:41.920 --> 2:11:44.720]  government oh my god the government has to survive
[2:11:44.720 --> 2:11:47.280]  the continuity of government because of course
[2:11:47.280 --> 2:11:51.280]  this government is so wonderful such a wonderful gift to the world we have to
[2:11:51.280 --> 2:11:55.440]  keep it alive as is no changes and no reforms
[2:11:55.440 --> 2:11:59.920]  keep it alive as is uh well you can tell where their priorities are
[2:11:59.920 --> 2:12:03.920]  now i'm not against all government by the way there is obviously a place for
[2:12:03.920 --> 2:12:07.600]  for some some level of certainly local
[2:12:07.600 --> 2:12:11.200]  government and you know i agree with ron paul hey cut it
[2:12:11.200 --> 2:12:14.720]  cut at least a trillion dollars out right now slash the government by
[2:12:14.720 --> 2:12:18.320]  i don't know 80 90 bring it down within reason
[2:12:18.320 --> 2:12:21.680]  to where it serves the people once again instead of
[2:12:21.680 --> 2:12:26.480]  demanding obedience from the people that would be a good situation
[2:12:26.480 --> 2:12:30.160]  there's also information if you notice this new show on national geographic
[2:12:30.160 --> 2:12:35.200]  about preppers and in the show they sort of they show these the most extreme
[2:12:35.200 --> 2:12:38.720]  preppers and then they make fun of them they say well this person built a
[2:12:38.720 --> 2:12:43.120]  giant underground bunker and my god that's so ridiculous they
[2:12:43.120 --> 2:12:46.960]  say i'm paraphrasing obviously it's so ridiculous because there's only a
[2:12:46.960 --> 2:12:51.600]  0.2 percent chance of that solar flare happening or
[2:12:51.600 --> 2:12:55.360]  you know a nuclear war happening or whatever so these people are crazy for
[2:12:55.360 --> 2:13:00.320]  preparing well there's a less percent chance of catching
[2:13:00.320 --> 2:13:03.680]  the flu and yet they push flu vaccines every
[2:13:03.680 --> 2:13:07.440]  single day go get a flu shot and they tell you that the shot's going to
[2:13:07.440 --> 2:13:11.840]  prevent the flu no it it actually doesn't vitamin d prevents it much
[2:13:11.840 --> 2:13:16.080]  better than than the flu shot although hey i might take some flak about that
[2:13:16.080 --> 2:13:19.600]  comment from our upcoming guest dr sheldon marx
[2:13:19.600 --> 2:13:23.360]  we'll find out i'll ask him on the air but the government says you know
[2:13:23.360 --> 2:13:27.120]  be afraid of the flu but don't be afraid of
[2:13:27.120 --> 2:13:30.160]  economic collapse because that's never going to happen i think they've got
[2:13:30.160 --> 2:13:33.840]  their priorities wrong i think economic collapse is a lot more treacherous and
[2:13:33.840 --> 2:13:36.880]  a lot more likely than catching the flu especially if you take care of your
[2:13:36.880 --> 2:13:40.720]  health with some basic nutritional information now
[2:13:40.720 --> 2:13:44.480]  we're joined now for the rest of this hour by dr sheldon marx he is a
[2:13:44.480 --> 2:13:48.720]  urologist and a micro surgeon he specializes in vasectomy
[2:13:48.720 --> 2:13:54.000]  reversals his website is dad's again dot com you know if you want to be a dad
[2:13:54.000 --> 2:13:58.640]  again and get that vasectomy reversed uh he's the
[2:13:58.640 --> 2:14:03.040]  guy who can do it for you now he is a member of a board member of the
[2:14:03.040 --> 2:14:05.920]  tucson police foundation he's one of the founding members
[2:14:05.920 --> 2:14:09.360]  i was one of the early members a board member of that foundation as well that's
[2:14:09.360 --> 2:14:12.880]  where i met dr marx and came to really like the guy
[2:14:12.880 --> 2:14:16.480]  respect his opinions on many things he's got a lot of great medical knowledge
[2:14:16.480 --> 2:14:20.160]  and emergency medicine information that he's going to share with us today
[2:14:20.160 --> 2:14:25.920]  so dr marx are you with us i am here ah okay great great to hear your voice
[2:14:25.920 --> 2:14:28.800]  are you joining us with a voice only or skype video too
[2:14:28.800 --> 2:14:31.600]  i'm on the video as well oh i see you now there you go
[2:14:31.600 --> 2:14:35.600]  okay awesome great great great to hear your voice today
[2:14:35.600 --> 2:14:40.080]  so what do you think about preparedness dr marx where do we need to begin
[2:14:40.080 --> 2:14:43.440]  uh we probably should have begun a decade ago
[2:14:43.440 --> 2:14:47.440]  uh i think what we need to do is when we're talking about preparedness from
[2:14:47.440 --> 2:14:50.400]  a medical point of view you need to start with something
[2:14:50.400 --> 2:14:53.680]  that you're an expert in and that's prevention i think that obviously
[2:14:53.680 --> 2:14:57.600]  people want to take good care of themselves before the crisis occurs
[2:14:57.600 --> 2:15:01.680]  it doesn't make any sense to be obese and not exercise and smoke
[2:15:01.680 --> 2:15:05.200]  and think that when the crisis happens then suddenly i'm going to
[2:15:05.200 --> 2:15:08.880]  be in shape and take care of things so obviously you want to get those things
[2:15:08.880 --> 2:15:12.320]  in order first uh you want to take care of anything
[2:15:12.320 --> 2:15:16.000]  that needs to be addressed ahead of time so preventative dentistry for example
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:18.720]  go to the dentist and and i tell all these people
[2:15:18.720 --> 2:15:22.320]  make sure you get your teeth cleaned and you're on top of that stuff because
[2:15:22.320 --> 2:15:26.480]  when the crisis occurs or when you don't have access to these things is not the
[2:15:26.480 --> 2:15:29.200]  time to start dealing with the abscesses and the root
[2:15:29.200 --> 2:15:32.720]  canals in those situations you know but it's just not cool to talk about you
[2:15:32.720 --> 2:15:37.200]  know we're going to prepare we want to go out and you know buy some ammo and
[2:15:37.200 --> 2:15:40.560]  get your teeth cleaned you know people don't normally talk about that right it
[2:15:40.560 --> 2:15:44.960]  doesn't have the excitement of of getting your mp5 or loading up
[2:15:44.960 --> 2:15:49.360]  up in systems but if anything is probably more important because
[2:15:49.360 --> 2:15:52.640]  if you don't have your health then the rest of that becomes worthless well
[2:15:52.640 --> 2:15:55.280]  that's a good point and where you're going to get insulin in a collapsed
[2:15:55.280 --> 2:15:58.160]  scenario if you're type 2 diabetic and you need insulin where you're going to
[2:15:58.160 --> 2:16:01.680]  get that right nowhere right uh and also you
[2:16:01.680 --> 2:16:04.560]  mentioned obesity i mean you you might have to do more physical work you might
[2:16:04.560 --> 2:16:06.960]  have to work your guard you might have to carry gear around how you're going to
[2:16:06.960 --> 2:16:08.880]  do that if you're not in better shape right
[2:16:08.880 --> 2:16:13.840]  absolutely so it is first thing first is is is look at it's your own situation
[2:16:13.840 --> 2:16:16.880]  and not just yourself but look at your family look at your kids
[2:16:16.880 --> 2:16:20.400]  your spouse your parents who are you going to be involved with
[2:16:20.400 --> 2:16:24.240]  who's part of your little community and and talk to them about health and so
[2:16:24.240 --> 2:16:29.600]  it's part of it is obviously nutrition diet exercise
[2:16:29.600 --> 2:16:34.800]  mental health avoiding bad habits the tobacco alcohol thing is obviously bad
[2:16:34.800 --> 2:16:38.240]  but it's it's also doing preventative things like going to see the dentist if
[2:16:38.240 --> 2:16:42.400]  you're old enough 45 or 50 then you should be getting your colonoscopy
[2:16:42.400 --> 2:16:47.280]  as exciting as that sounds you're not making our show sound exciting Sheldon
[2:16:47.280 --> 2:16:50.960]  well i apologize but you can freaking out i know
[2:16:50.960 --> 2:16:56.160]  all these all these it's what's it's those kinds of simple little easy things
[2:16:56.160 --> 2:16:59.760]  part of i guess when you talk about is once you've got past that
[2:16:59.760 --> 2:17:02.560]  then if you're starting to look at from a medical point of view what are you
[2:17:02.560 --> 2:17:06.320]  going to do the question is what are you preparing for
[2:17:06.320 --> 2:17:10.160]  uh and obviously like you had talked earlier about is there's the common
[2:17:10.160 --> 2:17:13.840]  things to worry about that are most likely and then there's the rare and
[2:17:13.840 --> 2:17:16.560]  more devastating things that people want to talk about
[2:17:16.560 --> 2:17:19.360]  and that's the stuff that gets to headlines and gets everyone excited
[2:17:19.360 --> 2:17:23.120]  right you need to take into account all of those things you need to think through
[2:17:23.120 --> 2:17:26.800]  what are our needs as a family and neighbors
[2:17:26.800 --> 2:17:29.680]  and then what do we do so that we can take care of ourselves and you know
[2:17:29.680 --> 2:17:33.040]  you're not going to be able to buy a book and go out and do
[2:17:33.040 --> 2:17:37.520]  hip reconstructive surgery or the appendectomies i mean it's it's
[2:17:37.520 --> 2:17:41.840]  even when you know what you're doing simple things can become nightmares
[2:17:41.840 --> 2:17:44.640]  just because of the the magic of the way the body is designed
[2:17:44.640 --> 2:17:48.080]  all right let's let's talk about the medical kits though a lot of people
[2:17:48.080 --> 2:17:50.880]  go out and they buy these medical kits or these first aid kits and it says it's
[2:17:50.880 --> 2:17:55.280]  got 500 pieces in it and you know 490 of those pieces are bandages
[2:17:55.280 --> 2:17:58.480]  right what's your take on these medical kits i love
[2:17:58.480 --> 2:18:01.360]  band aids i think they're the greatest thing but what you have to do is when
[2:18:01.360 --> 2:18:04.720]  you buy a kit first thing you do is you open it up
[2:18:04.720 --> 2:18:09.120]  and you have to look at what's in it and decide what's relevant to you
[2:18:09.120 --> 2:18:12.480]  what do you know how to use what do you not know how to use so if it's got sam
[2:18:12.480 --> 2:18:14.960]  splints in there which is something everybody should have
[2:18:14.960 --> 2:18:18.720]  if it's got sam splints then you definitely want to learn how to use them
[2:18:18.720 --> 2:18:22.240]  and when to use them and when not to use them
[2:18:22.240 --> 2:18:26.400]  if it's got uh over-the-counter medications in there you want to learn
[2:18:26.400 --> 2:18:29.920]  what they're for what they're not for when to avoid using them
[2:18:29.920 --> 2:18:33.520]  and so you have to go through each of the different content pieces
[2:18:33.520 --> 2:18:39.520]  and identify what is best for you what is relevant for your needs because
[2:18:39.520 --> 2:18:43.760]  probably it's going to be mostly band aids and gauze and cheap things
[2:18:43.760 --> 2:18:47.200]  and then decide where are the gaps and then go
[2:18:47.200 --> 2:18:51.200]  to your local pharmacy or go online and start filling in the gaps
[2:18:51.200 --> 2:18:53.680]  with those extra things you're going to need based on
[2:18:53.680 --> 2:18:57.760]  what you anticipate your problems maybe is there a source that you know of that
[2:18:57.760 --> 2:19:00.240]  that you might recommend that where people can get
[2:19:00.240 --> 2:19:05.840]  I don't know full-blown medical kits the yeah there's a few of them and off the
[2:19:05.840 --> 2:19:08.720]  top of my I'm just blocking on it I think uh
[2:19:08.720 --> 2:19:12.800]  um well we you can think about during the break we'll talk about after the break
[2:19:12.800 --> 2:19:17.040]  wilderness medicine based kits because there you truly are in an
[2:19:17.040 --> 2:19:22.000]  austere environment you don't have any other resources available and so the
[2:19:22.000 --> 2:19:25.360]  concept is if you're out in the wilderness or you're a
[2:19:25.360 --> 2:19:27.920]  hunter or you're hiking or you're just out there
[2:19:27.920 --> 2:19:30.560]  and something happens it's those wilderness medical kits but I'll have
[2:19:30.560 --> 2:19:33.520]  that answer for you after the break okay that's good we are headed to a break
[2:19:33.520 --> 2:19:37.840]  shortly here and we're being uh joined by Dr Sheldon Marks here we'll
[2:19:37.840 --> 2:19:42.160]  continue with him after the break and your calls on emergency
[2:19:42.160 --> 2:19:45.520]  medicine we've got callers in the queue we'll get to your calls here shortly
[2:19:45.520 --> 2:19:48.720]  as we continue right here on the Alex Jones show thanks for joining us stay
[2:19:48.720 --> 2:20:01.280]  with us we'll be right back
[2:20:01.280 --> 2:20:03.840]  I'd seen the ungevity products work for many others
[2:20:03.840 --> 2:20:07.120]  and so I bought a bunch of them started using them had a little bit of results
[2:20:07.120 --> 2:20:10.240]  but I wasn't following the regimen every day but
[2:20:10.240 --> 2:20:15.120]  Aaron Dykes in my office did and lost more than 60 pounds when I saw those
[2:20:15.120 --> 2:20:17.920]  results I said I better follow my own advice

[2:24:16.720 --> 2:24:21.040]  okay we're continuing our interview with Dr Sheldon Marks he's
[2:24:21.040 --> 2:24:25.520]  a micro surgeon a urologist an author and also an expert in
[2:24:25.520 --> 2:24:28.400]  emergency medical preparedness he continues with us in this
[2:24:28.400 --> 2:24:32.000]  short segment and also after the break and he is
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:36.000]  well he performs vasectomy reversals I think five days
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:39.920]  a week something along those lines at dad's again.com is a website and I was
[2:24:39.920 --> 2:24:42.960]  just thinking Dr Marks during the break you know
[2:24:42.960 --> 2:24:46.400]  you're an expert in sort of delicately handling the delicates
[2:24:46.400 --> 2:24:50.240]  of lots of men you should teach the TSA to be a little more gentle
[2:24:50.240 --> 2:24:53.600]  they're down there playing rock'em sock'em robots with everybody's
[2:24:53.600 --> 2:24:57.760]  stuff that's that's not cool no especially if you've just had reconstructive
[2:24:57.760 --> 2:25:01.680]  surgery down there oh yeah yeah what do you what do you
[2:25:01.680 --> 2:25:05.760]  think about the TSA and all all their business getting in our business
[2:25:05.760 --> 2:25:10.880]  you know that's that's that I don't know I get so confused because
[2:25:10.880 --> 2:25:14.000]  you know I think that clearly we want to maintain our rights but on the other
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:17.840]  hand uh the bad guys unfortunately seem to
[2:25:17.840 --> 2:25:21.280]  get all the privileges and we're the ones that get punished I think that
[2:25:21.280 --> 2:25:26.560]  9-11 from what I understood the problem was that it wasn't so much people
[2:25:26.560 --> 2:25:28.960]  getting on the planes with things but stuff that had been
[2:25:28.960 --> 2:25:32.320]  replaced in fact I spoke once to a flight attendant
[2:25:32.320 --> 2:25:37.120]  whose plane was grounded on 9-11 before any passengers were allowed on
[2:25:37.120 --> 2:25:40.400]  and she found a bunch of knives and blades already
[2:25:40.400 --> 2:25:43.760]  pre-positioned on the plane obviously by the tarmac workers
[2:25:43.760 --> 2:25:48.480]  so everyone's so excited I think the problem is we become very reactive
[2:25:48.480 --> 2:25:51.920]  we wait for something to happen so the shoe bomber suddenly we're looking at
[2:25:51.920 --> 2:25:54.720]  shoes the underwear bomber suddenly we're looking at underwear
[2:25:54.720 --> 2:25:57.440]  we're not thinking ahead we're not trying to think what these people are
[2:25:57.440 --> 2:26:01.280]  going to do and how they're going to do it I think that yes screening the
[2:26:01.280 --> 2:26:04.640]  little old ladies to some degree is important to some
[2:26:04.640 --> 2:26:07.920]  point but I think the tarmac workers are the ones that come and go and they
[2:26:07.920 --> 2:26:10.240]  should be screened and I have no idea what's happening with those people
[2:26:10.240 --> 2:26:13.840]  well the I know this is not what I invited y'all to talk about but just you
[2:26:13.840 --> 2:26:16.960]  know the shoe bomber was put on there by government operatives the underwear
[2:26:16.960 --> 2:26:20.320]  bomber was put on there by high-level operatives I mean this is not
[2:26:20.320 --> 2:26:24.160]  accident not a coincidence but anyway let's get back to
[2:26:24.160 --> 2:26:27.920]  medical issues here you know I do want to take some
[2:26:27.920 --> 2:26:30.160]  calls are you okay to take some calls right I love to
[2:26:30.160 --> 2:26:33.440]  okay let's while you're doing that it's adventure medical kits those are
[2:26:33.440 --> 2:26:38.400]  professional kits designed for medical professionals to take
[2:26:38.400 --> 2:26:41.920]  with them they have small little ones all the way up to elaborate ones but
[2:26:41.920 --> 2:26:45.200]  they're they're designed so that if I want to go out and be the
[2:26:45.200 --> 2:26:49.040]  physician accompanying a wilderness trip up a mountain or on a
[2:26:49.040 --> 2:26:52.240]  river that's where I go to buy my kits to support
[2:26:52.240 --> 2:26:55.760]  what I'm going to be doing very very cool I also know there's a
[2:26:55.760 --> 2:26:59.760]  couple out there named Dr. Bones and nurse Amy
[2:26:59.760 --> 2:27:04.480]  and their website I believe is doomandbloom.net and they make
[2:27:04.480 --> 2:27:08.320]  medical kits that combine western medicine and a little bit of holistic
[2:27:08.320 --> 2:27:12.160]  like herbal based salves and things like that for skin you know skin healing
[2:27:12.160 --> 2:27:14.400]  things like that so that's something else to check out but
[2:27:14.400 --> 2:27:18.160]  adventure medical kits and what's really important is when you get a kit
[2:27:18.160 --> 2:27:21.360]  look through it and and remember just owning it
[2:27:21.360 --> 2:27:25.120]  doesn't mean you're going to have it if you if you're not careful with it then
[2:27:25.120 --> 2:27:28.480]  the rodents will get into it you want to make sure that it's moisture proof
[2:27:28.480 --> 2:27:31.680]  because humidity will destroy everything so depending on where you live
[2:27:31.680 --> 2:27:35.760]  you want to secure it and you also want to twice a year at a minimum
[2:27:35.760 --> 2:27:39.760]  check on it make sure it is ready to go in addition to the home kit you're
[2:27:39.760 --> 2:27:42.560]  probably going to want to have a travel kit something in your vehicle
[2:27:42.560 --> 2:27:46.080]  and then a little bitty pack that you can have with you if you do have to grab
[2:27:46.080 --> 2:27:49.440]  and go kind of a thing yeah yeah very good points there Dr.
[2:27:49.440 --> 2:27:54.000]  Marx let's go to our caller John in Pennsylvania you're on the air go
[2:27:54.000 --> 2:27:57.200]  ahead how you doing today doing great man

[2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:48.080]  understand I just found out about him uh he needs a lot of organization

[2:28:51.040 --> 2:28:54.240]  Dr. Marx as a guest right now do you have a question for him
[2:28:54.240 --> 2:29:00.080]  I have a very complicated question uh-oh my son is an epileptic okay

[2:29:03.920 --> 2:29:08.080]  basically prepared for about every scenario that that's guy talked about
[2:29:08.080 --> 2:29:13.360]  but this is there some type of natural source
[2:29:13.360 --> 2:29:20.000]  of anti uh anti seizure or medication maybe yes uh he's on

[2:29:30.320 --> 2:29:34.080]  it on the other side uh something interested in some
[2:29:34.080 --> 2:29:37.120]  getting his hands on some anti seizure medication for his kid

[2:34:22.320 --> 2:34:26.080]  before the break was from a gentleman who's got an epileptic
[2:34:26.080 --> 2:34:29.280]  child and is wondering what he can do in a collapsed scenario
[2:34:29.280 --> 2:34:32.560]  to keep his child to prevent his child from having seizures what's what's your
[2:34:32.560 --> 2:34:35.840]  take on that dr marx well first of all let me just say i know
[2:34:35.840 --> 2:34:40.400]  absolutely nothing about epilepsy and the medications and so i'm commenting
[2:34:40.400 --> 2:34:44.160]  basically on just some general concepts and then i just went on during the break
[2:34:44.160 --> 2:34:48.240]  and did a and tried to find it there's very little on when you google it to try
[2:34:48.240 --> 2:34:51.600]  to find answers to that one thing that i do tell people
[2:34:51.600 --> 2:34:56.640]  is since we don't know what tomorrow holds whether it's a gas crisis or a
[2:34:56.640 --> 2:35:00.400]  pharmacy shutdown or anything if you're on any medications or any
[2:35:00.400 --> 2:35:03.920]  members of the family especially important medications
[2:35:03.920 --> 2:35:07.440]  and everyone's stable and happy you should have at least two to three months
[2:35:07.440 --> 2:35:11.440]  worth of that medication available and then use the old stuff first is your
[2:35:11.440 --> 2:35:14.480]  restock it so absolutely whether it's thyroid
[2:35:14.480 --> 2:35:18.480]  medicine heart medicine whatever you're taking
[2:35:18.480 --> 2:35:22.960]  the when the crisis occurs is not the time to run to cvs or wall greens or
[2:35:22.960 --> 2:35:26.000]  walmart and get in line and think that you're going to get your three months
[2:35:26.000 --> 2:35:28.800]  stash so it's also not the time to try to quit the
[2:35:28.800 --> 2:35:32.400]  medication cold turkey i'm sure you would agree with that i mean we we want
[2:35:32.400 --> 2:35:36.560]  to get off medications when we can safely ahead of time
[2:35:36.560 --> 2:35:40.400]  absolutely right that yeah you don't want to start mixing around with that
[2:35:40.400 --> 2:35:43.040]  because at a time when you need to be able to be focused
[2:35:43.040 --> 2:35:45.920]  and and and concentrate on what's going on is not the time
[2:35:45.920 --> 2:35:49.600]  to start having a lot of health issues as far as the epilepsy goes i'm going to
[2:35:49.600 --> 2:35:52.320]  defer to you on that but i the only thing i can find
[2:35:52.320 --> 2:35:56.640]  is something called mornita citropholia and that was just somebody
[2:35:56.640 --> 2:36:01.440]  responded to a depacote uh blog and and and so probably the
[2:36:01.440 --> 2:36:04.240]  thing to do is to seek out a health care professional
[2:36:04.240 --> 2:36:08.560]  who's familiar with alternatives to depacote and find out what's available
[2:36:08.560 --> 2:36:12.800]  but i would be very cautious because i do know that when you start to mess with
[2:36:12.800 --> 2:36:15.360]  medications you can change the seizure threshold
[2:36:15.360 --> 2:36:19.360]  and i'd hate for that kid to have problems while you're trying to transition
[2:36:19.360 --> 2:36:21.760]  if you're doing it on your own so never do that kind of stuff
[2:36:21.760 --> 2:36:26.000]  with serious medications on your own because you don't know over what time
[2:36:26.000 --> 2:36:28.640]  frame some medications you can stop at cold turkey
[2:36:28.640 --> 2:36:32.400]  and start something else up other medications may require weeks or even
[2:36:32.400 --> 2:36:35.440]  months of transitioning off to prevent any problems
[2:36:35.440 --> 2:36:39.280]  i would say this is just another example of why it's good to get off as many meds
[2:36:39.280 --> 2:36:43.200]  as you can because you know who knows what the
[2:36:43.200 --> 2:36:45.920]  real cause behind that epilepsy seizures can be
[2:36:45.920 --> 2:36:49.760]  promoted in part by dietary sources you know aspartame
[2:36:49.760 --> 2:36:54.000]  excitotoxins some of the chemical juvents and some vaccines have
[2:36:54.000 --> 2:36:58.320]  caused seizures and many children's one of the main side effects of vaccines
[2:36:58.320 --> 2:37:01.840]  there are you know lots of sources where you can pick up bad
[2:37:01.840 --> 2:37:04.960]  bad chemicals pesticides for example they can lead to that so
[2:37:04.960 --> 2:37:08.000]  so sorry to the caller we can't answer his question directly but he's going to
[2:37:08.000 --> 2:37:10.880]  have to do some research that's a tough one can i let's talk about for a second
[2:37:10.880 --> 2:37:14.000]  real quick vaccinations because i know we kind of differ on that a little bit
[2:37:14.000 --> 2:37:18.320]  that kind of makes for fun is is i know there's a lot of controversy and i
[2:37:18.320 --> 2:37:21.680]  don't know the answer but there are some vaccinations that
[2:37:21.680 --> 2:37:24.960]  you might disagree on i think are pretty important to people to consider
[2:37:24.960 --> 2:37:28.720]  especially in the scenarios that your your listeners are aware of and one of
[2:37:28.720 --> 2:37:32.080]  them for example is tetanus you want to make sure you're up to date on that
[2:37:32.080 --> 2:37:35.280]  that's not the time to step on a rusty nail and end up
[2:37:35.280 --> 2:37:38.160]  sick and dying because you didn't want to get your tetanus
[2:37:38.160 --> 2:37:40.880]  update it you know yeah or maybe cholera
[2:37:40.880 --> 2:37:43.840]  huh yeah cholera is also yeah but cholera is a little bit trickier because
[2:37:43.840 --> 2:37:47.520]  you have to keep updating that uh hepatitis one of the big things that
[2:37:47.520 --> 2:37:51.200]  happens in in after disasters is people get a lot of
[2:37:51.200 --> 2:37:54.880]  hepatitis so what is hepatitis vaccine out there that is
[2:37:54.880 --> 2:37:57.680]  i'm not aware of any horrible side effects but then again i've not really
[2:37:57.680 --> 2:38:00.800]  looked at that a lot you know the thing is there there's one school thought is
[2:38:00.800 --> 2:38:05.120]  that there there is such a thing as a safe vaccine if they had a one shot
[2:38:05.120 --> 2:38:09.520]  vaccine let's say hepatitis c that's a one shot or a two stage
[2:38:09.520 --> 2:38:12.640]  vaccine that did not have the chemical adjuvants in it
[2:38:12.640 --> 2:38:16.240]  and it did not have the thimerosal in it because it was being
[2:38:16.240 --> 2:38:19.760]  one vial shared by 10 different people so they don't need the preservative
[2:38:19.760 --> 2:38:23.200]  you know if you can have it without the thimerosal and without the aluminum
[2:38:23.200 --> 2:38:27.040]  and without the polysorbate adium without the formaldehyde arguably that
[2:38:27.040 --> 2:38:31.680]  could be a arguably could be an understandably safe
[2:38:31.680 --> 2:38:35.360]  vaccine but right but but at the same time any and this
[2:38:35.360 --> 2:38:38.320]  goes with everything whether it's a aspirin or
[2:38:38.320 --> 2:38:42.480]  peptobysmal or even even the natural supplements
[2:38:42.480 --> 2:38:46.000]  there's everybody is different everyone responds differently to
[2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:49.360]  everything that you put in your body and so you have to know what you're doing
[2:38:49.360 --> 2:38:53.200]  in way the benefits and the risks well yeah and the
[2:38:53.200 --> 2:38:56.480]  problem doctor marks is that they're slamming these little kids with nine
[2:38:56.480 --> 2:38:59.280]  vaccines all at once that have the mercury in them that have the aluminum
[2:38:59.280 --> 2:39:02.640]  in them that have the adjuvants in them and they some of them just go into
[2:39:02.640 --> 2:39:06.320]  coma is some of them just die and and you know i was talking to
[2:39:06.320 --> 2:39:10.160]  people trying to understand and i think and again this is something i know
[2:39:10.160 --> 2:39:12.880]  nothing about it's not my field of expertise
[2:39:12.880 --> 2:39:17.200]  but people who are involved in the vaccines and talking about the the Dan
[2:39:17.200 --> 2:39:20.800]  doctors and the and the autism are saying the vaccines
[2:39:20.800 --> 2:39:24.480]  individually are not the issue it's when they're combined
[2:39:24.480 --> 2:39:27.600]  when the little baby gets 400 vaccines in one shot
[2:39:27.600 --> 2:39:31.280]  yeah combined with Tylenol overloads the system so
[2:39:31.280 --> 2:39:37.920]  again the vaccines i'm worried about them as well but on the other hand
[2:39:37.920 --> 2:39:42.240]  measles is coming back and some of these diseases are horrible and they're
[2:39:42.240 --> 2:39:46.320]  devastating and they're life-destroying so before you say blanket
[2:39:46.320 --> 2:39:49.600]  no to vaccines you need to look at each one and think about what it is you're
[2:39:49.600 --> 2:39:52.400]  saying no to and look at the risks because whooping
[2:39:52.400 --> 2:39:55.440]  cough is coming back like i said measles is back
[2:39:55.440 --> 2:39:59.760]  polio is still around you know there's you know those those things don't concern
[2:39:59.760 --> 2:40:04.480]  me doctor marx i mean measles no big deal even even this aggressive tb get
[2:40:04.480 --> 2:40:08.160]  some good vitamin d go and get your speaking of vitamin d for those i've
[2:40:08.160 --> 2:40:10.720]  got to hold my whole stash right here awesome
[2:40:10.720 --> 2:40:14.080]  wow you have actually a box of vitamin d i have a box of them i go through them
[2:40:14.080 --> 2:40:17.120]  yeah so i take my vitamin d's yeah i'm not worried about polio i'm not
[2:40:17.120 --> 2:40:20.320]  worried you know a lot of this i i know you didn't you didn't want to get into
[2:40:20.320 --> 2:40:23.760]  necessarily a vaccine debate but some of this is just about hygiene and
[2:40:23.760 --> 2:40:27.600]  having like clean sewer systems right now now you've moved to the smartest
[2:40:27.600 --> 2:40:31.440]  thing the best thing you can do if you're concerned about your health
[2:40:31.440 --> 2:40:36.480]  now if bad things happen if you're out camping if it's end of the world whatever
[2:40:36.480 --> 2:40:40.240]  is believe it or not the easiest thing again we're not about excitement
[2:40:40.240 --> 2:40:44.080]  is just washing your hands right washing your hands before you prepare food
[2:40:44.080 --> 2:40:47.440]  washing your hands before after you go to the bathroom
[2:40:47.440 --> 2:40:51.280]  washing the kitchen utensils watching the preparation space
[2:40:51.280 --> 2:40:55.280]  i mean if you just wash your hands then you dramatically reduce
[2:40:55.280 --> 2:40:58.400]  by at least half the number of people that get horrible
[2:40:58.400 --> 2:41:02.000]  intestinal things like the cholera absolutely one and a half million kids
[2:41:02.000 --> 2:41:05.120]  still die every year in the world from diarrhea
[2:41:05.120 --> 2:41:08.880]  again an exciting subject from just simple hygiene issues
[2:41:08.880 --> 2:41:12.960]  you're just full of exciting subjects i apologize that's kind of that's
[2:41:12.960 --> 2:41:16.320]  i'm kind of yeah if it involves the pelvic area then that's kind of my world
[2:41:16.320 --> 2:41:19.680]  idea you're like the the sober up doctor like
[2:41:19.680 --> 2:41:23.040]  everybody else is talking about you have a bunker and get some smoke
[2:41:23.040 --> 2:41:25.680]  grenades and you're like get a colonoscopy and shake her teeth
[2:41:25.680 --> 2:41:28.640]  right i know you know yeah no but you're the guy who's going to
[2:41:28.640 --> 2:41:31.280]  save lives you know you're the guy who's really i mean this is important
[2:41:31.280 --> 2:41:34.320]  it's the hand washing and people forget that because it's not the exciting thing
[2:41:34.320 --> 2:41:37.920]  it's not the drama thing um something really simple that
[2:41:37.920 --> 2:41:42.080]  everyone really should do is take a cpr first aid course good
[2:41:42.080 --> 2:41:45.680]  but not just yourself because if you're the guy lying there with the chest pain
[2:41:45.680 --> 2:41:48.960]  make sure your wife make sure your your teenage kids know what to do
[2:41:48.960 --> 2:41:52.640]  make sure even little kids know to call 911 as long as we have that
[2:41:52.640 --> 2:41:56.480]  make sure you know your neighbors are really your strongest
[2:41:56.480 --> 2:41:59.520]  suit i mean so you want to buy things and do all this cool stuff
[2:41:59.520 --> 2:42:04.240]  but truly the strength of survival comes with a like-minded group of people
[2:42:04.240 --> 2:42:08.080]  so your neighbors your friends people at church at school
[2:42:08.080 --> 2:42:12.720]  at work you should all do a cpr first aid class there you should talk about
[2:42:12.720 --> 2:42:16.160]  who's got what skills and who knows what things maybe someone
[2:42:16.160 --> 2:42:19.280]  was a dental assistant for 10 years before they did something else
[2:42:19.280 --> 2:42:22.400]  maybe it turns out there's a paramedic who lives right behind you that you
[2:42:22.400 --> 2:42:26.000]  don't know about so you want to that's a smart thing to do that most people
[2:42:26.000 --> 2:42:28.800]  don't do because they're so caught up you know stockpiling
[2:42:28.800 --> 2:42:30.640]  things good good advice we're going to get to a
[2:42:30.640 --> 2:42:33.600]  caller here in a second but i've got one more question for you dr marx
[2:42:33.600 --> 2:42:37.440]  a lot of people in the prepper community they they keep asking me how do they
[2:42:37.440 --> 2:42:41.200]  get legitimate medication pain killers for
[2:42:41.200 --> 2:42:44.480]  emergency use only and of course lots of red flags go off pain killers pain
[2:42:44.480 --> 2:42:47.040]  killers you know Whitney Houston everything but
[2:42:47.040 --> 2:42:51.360]  is there any legitimate legal way to get something that might work
[2:42:51.360 --> 2:42:55.440]  in a total breakdown scenario that you know as a medication pain killer
[2:42:55.440 --> 2:42:58.880]  something beyond you know aspirin and Tylenol right well if you're gonna
[2:42:58.880 --> 2:43:01.840]  yeah well anything that's controlled narcotics
[2:43:01.840 --> 2:43:05.360]  unfortunately has a very thick paper trail with it so if i write for a
[2:43:05.360 --> 2:43:08.640]  prescription for narcotics i have to include my
[2:43:08.640 --> 2:43:12.240]  federal numbers and they monitor those prescriptions and i have to have
[2:43:12.240 --> 2:43:17.280]  appropriate documentation in a medical record as to why that gentleman got his
[2:43:17.280 --> 2:43:20.160]  for Tylenol with codeines or lord tabs or
[2:43:20.160 --> 2:43:23.920]  percadence however i was just reading a book that listed
[2:43:23.920 --> 2:43:28.160]  the the the pain blocking qualities of all medications
[2:43:28.160 --> 2:43:32.080]  and i was surprised to see that an 800 milligram ibuprofen
[2:43:32.080 --> 2:43:35.440]  with all the potential side effects that i'm sure you'll talk about but an 800
[2:43:35.440 --> 2:43:39.360]  milligram ibuprofen is far and away more powerful than
[2:43:39.360 --> 2:43:43.040]  almost all the other medications really narcotics do is they really don't make
[2:43:43.040 --> 2:43:46.480]  the pain go away they simply dull you to where you
[2:43:46.480 --> 2:43:51.280]  can just you don't care about it whereas the anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen
[2:43:51.280 --> 2:43:55.520]  what they do is they actually block the chemicals that stimulate the nerves
[2:43:55.520 --> 2:43:58.720]  that then your brain interprets his pain but what about getting something
[2:43:58.720 --> 2:44:02.240]  quickly where you got a buddy that's just been injured you know he's he's
[2:44:02.240 --> 2:44:05.440]  bleeding he's screaming how do you how do you help your buddy
[2:44:05.440 --> 2:44:09.360]  well in the military world they would give them these these fentanyl lollipops
[2:44:09.360 --> 2:44:12.800]  it's a very powerful narcotic they would suck on it but
[2:44:12.800 --> 2:44:15.840]  what and i've been involved with a lot of that kind of training
[2:44:15.840 --> 2:44:18.880]  what we're basically told and understand is
[2:44:18.880 --> 2:44:21.840]  they're not going to remember the horrible excruciating pain they're going
[2:44:21.840 --> 2:44:24.800]  through you are and it may be upsetting to you
[2:44:24.800 --> 2:44:28.960]  so you have to focus on what you have to do so whether it's it's applying
[2:44:28.960 --> 2:44:34.480]  pernicates or using combat gauze to stop bleeding or or whatever you have to do
[2:44:34.480 --> 2:44:38.720]  that has to be first the pain really is more
[2:44:38.720 --> 2:44:41.280]  it's a tough one because you really aren't going to have narcotics and if you
[2:44:41.280 --> 2:44:46.320]  have narcotics in your possession and you don't have a prescription for it
[2:44:46.320 --> 2:44:50.080]  uh then i think there's all kinds of felonies you've committed and then
[2:44:50.080 --> 2:44:53.520]  right people start you know and if you have narcotics there you you can
[2:44:53.520 --> 2:44:57.280]  bet that some looters are going to want to get that supply from you right
[2:44:57.280 --> 2:45:00.320]  absolutely so yeah you don't want to put a sign out i guess you know
[2:45:00.320 --> 2:45:04.560]  call up whitney houston's estate and get stuff you don't have like a big pharmacy
[2:45:04.560 --> 2:45:08.320]  sign on on your door right yeah i guess any any major movie star
[2:45:08.320 --> 2:45:12.480]  musician will have a good stash no and how sad is it that whitney houston was
[2:45:12.480 --> 2:45:15.840]  killed by fda approved pharmaceuticals just like
[2:45:15.840 --> 2:45:20.880]  Heath Ledger just like Elvis Presley in fact you know what Bruce Lee was killed
[2:45:20.880 --> 2:45:24.480]  by brain swelling allergic reaction to a medication as well we're going to
[2:45:24.480 --> 2:45:28.240]  actually do a story on that but i mean i know these they have their
[2:45:28.240 --> 2:45:32.240]  role in medicine the problem is that that it's
[2:45:32.240 --> 2:45:35.520]  the doctor who when someone comes in and has a problem we want to make them
[2:45:35.520 --> 2:45:40.080]  better and and everybody functions from their own direction so standard if you
[2:45:40.080 --> 2:45:43.120]  come to me and you've got a bladder infection i'm
[2:45:43.120 --> 2:45:46.880]  going to want to treat you with what's in my arsenal of treatments and yeah
[2:45:46.880 --> 2:45:50.000]  and someone's going to come to different people and get different things
[2:45:50.000 --> 2:45:53.840]  the problem is a lot of these people know how to play the game and so they'll go
[2:45:53.840 --> 2:45:57.360]  to one doctor and get xanax the doctor will be conservative and say i'm only
[2:45:57.360 --> 2:46:00.640]  going to give you 10 of these then they'll go to another doctor for back pain
[2:46:00.640 --> 2:46:03.040]  well i'm going to give you some narcotics but i'm not going to give you too
[2:46:03.040 --> 2:46:07.760]  many and by the end of the week they've seen four or five different doctors
[2:46:07.760 --> 2:46:11.760]  who not knowing that the other doctors exist yeah loaded these people up with
[2:46:11.760 --> 2:46:15.760]  large stashes we saw one lady once when i was writing with a paramedic out here
[2:46:15.760 --> 2:46:19.520]  and five different doctors had given her narcotics and she was calling the
[2:46:19.520 --> 2:46:22.640]  paramedics because she was severely constipated and wanted help
[2:46:22.640 --> 2:46:26.160]  which is again we're back down to the pelvic area but the point is none of
[2:46:26.160 --> 2:46:29.040]  these doctors realized that the other doctors were prescribing
[2:46:29.040 --> 2:46:32.080]  these narcotics which have a constipation as a side effect
[2:46:32.080 --> 2:46:35.120]  so that's a classic example of what happens and these
[2:46:35.120 --> 2:46:39.760]  celebrities have the clout to be able to make a phone call have a doctor come to
[2:46:39.760 --> 2:46:42.640]  them get in to see somebody
[2:46:42.640 --> 2:46:46.000]  celebrities and wealthy super wealthy tend to surround themselves with yes men
[2:46:46.000 --> 2:46:49.840]  like the emperor's new clothes so people who if somebody says no to them
[2:46:49.840 --> 2:46:52.720]  they're fired and yeah they'll find somebody who'll say yes well this is the
[2:46:52.720 --> 2:46:55.280]  story of rush limbaugh and how he got into his
[2:46:55.280 --> 2:46:58.800]  his addiction i mean they get so many people
[2:46:58.800 --> 2:47:02.800]  they find somebody who doesn't have the strength to say no
[2:47:02.800 --> 2:47:05.920]  and and they find people who will give them what they want and they go
[2:47:05.920 --> 2:47:08.560]  somewhere else and especially if they travel a lot
[2:47:08.560 --> 2:47:11.600]  all right let's let's good answers dr marce let's get to some college though
[2:47:11.600 --> 2:47:15.520]  we've got jared in north carolina you're on the air go ahead with a question for
[2:47:15.520 --> 2:47:19.840]  dr marx please hey guys how are you all day doing good
[2:47:19.840 --> 2:47:23.680]  hey good man i'm glad to be on info wars finally but um i've never really
[2:47:23.680 --> 2:47:27.600]  um had a chance to speak to a doctor um who i would maybe
[2:47:27.600 --> 2:47:31.600]  you know think outside of i guess it's the stereotypical system of you know
[2:47:31.600 --> 2:47:34.720]  total kill at it um but my question is probably not
[2:47:34.720 --> 2:47:38.320]  in your field but i've always had since i was a kid had all kind of crazy
[2:47:38.320 --> 2:47:42.880]  science issues and um i've seen doctors all over um north carolina
[2:47:42.880 --> 2:47:46.240]  i've been to do some of the best training of physicians of you know the
[2:47:46.240 --> 2:47:50.320]  specialties and i guess my question not necessarily in to um
[2:47:50.320 --> 2:47:54.880]  preparedness for for an economic collapse the more along the lines of
[2:47:54.880 --> 2:47:58.880]  like chemical warfare on american people now um in our food in our water
[2:47:58.880 --> 2:48:01.920]  um i've had several doctors that i was saying i've had always kind of
[2:48:01.920 --> 2:48:04.960]  science issues my whole life and nobody's ever been able to tell me what it was
[2:48:04.960 --> 2:48:10.880]  well listen let's do this jared no good good question but what we're going to
[2:48:10.880 --> 2:48:13.600]  run into here is everybody's going to call with their specific medical question
[2:48:13.600 --> 2:48:16.960]  for dr marx who's really focusing a narrow area let's
[2:48:16.960 --> 2:48:19.680]  let me broaden that question if you don't mind to say
[2:48:19.680 --> 2:48:24.000]  for anybody dr marx for anybody who's got a specific medical concern now that
[2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:26.880]  may be a mystery condition or a chronic condition
[2:48:26.880 --> 2:48:30.880]  what is the strategy that they can go through to try to resolve that
[2:48:30.880 --> 2:48:35.280]  you know ahead of uh the end of the world as we know it or whatever
[2:48:35.280 --> 2:48:37.760]  scenario people might have in mind what what's your advice
[2:48:37.760 --> 2:48:42.320]  i think to do is what this gentleman did make sense is you go to the best you
[2:48:42.320 --> 2:48:46.480]  can find the experts here's my problem and see what they have to say
[2:48:46.480 --> 2:48:50.080]  but and since in light of what you do in your world is
[2:48:50.080 --> 2:48:52.880]  is their answers are going to come from their training
[2:48:52.880 --> 2:48:57.120]  it's it's it's standard western medicine here's the problem i'm going to treat
[2:48:57.120 --> 2:49:00.000]  you here you have something physically wrong we can do surgery
[2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:02.400]  here's some medications tell me if you're better
[2:49:02.400 --> 2:49:05.760]  he may have some weird allergies maybe he needs to see some allergists and get
[2:49:05.760 --> 2:49:09.360]  that checked out it may be that what you have to do
[2:49:09.360 --> 2:49:12.560]  is seek out some doctors who've got a lot of mixed training so
[2:49:12.560 --> 2:49:16.400]  on one hand are the naturopaths alternative medicine people and that's
[2:49:16.400 --> 2:49:19.840]  all they do the other extreme are the western
[2:49:19.840 --> 2:49:24.000]  standard medicine doctors were that's my world and then in the middle
[2:49:24.000 --> 2:49:27.360]  are the ones the the mds like the ones that dr
[2:49:27.360 --> 2:49:31.600]  andrew is based out of tucson here and people have done their medical training
[2:49:31.600 --> 2:49:34.480]  and then they go and do additional fellowship training
[2:49:34.480 --> 2:49:38.480]  in integrative complementary medicine and so if i were to go to see one of
[2:49:38.480 --> 2:49:41.280]  those guys and say hey here's my problem then you're
[2:49:41.280 --> 2:49:44.240]  getting the best of everything then you're saying okay let's look and see
[2:49:44.240 --> 2:49:46.880]  what this is but let's also look at this and let's
[2:49:46.880 --> 2:49:50.640]  consider that to me that seems to be the smartest solution for people
[2:49:50.640 --> 2:49:54.240]  that makes sense find these doctors who really are straddling both sides of
[2:49:54.240 --> 2:49:58.000]  the fence because if a bear is charging you and you've
[2:49:58.000 --> 2:50:01.840]  got a rifle with two rounds in it you're not going to fire one and throw the
[2:50:01.840 --> 2:50:04.560]  rifle down i think use everything you've got and so
[2:50:04.560 --> 2:50:08.560]  use the best of everything to try to figure out what the problem is
[2:50:08.560 --> 2:50:12.000]  and then try some of the treatments dr marx we're about to wrap up this segment
[2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:15.440]  i want to thank you for joining us what you you've also published a couple of
[2:50:15.440 --> 2:50:17.760]  books on prostate cancer you want to give those
[2:50:17.760 --> 2:50:21.760]  books out here give the name out sure it's it's a fourth edition it's called
[2:50:21.760 --> 2:50:25.680]  prostate and cancer a family guide to diagnosis treatment and survival
[2:50:25.680 --> 2:50:29.520]  and it's a question and answer kind of walk you from first thing all the way
[2:50:29.520 --> 2:50:33.120]  through uh on prostate cancer prevention diagnosis
[2:50:33.120 --> 2:50:36.720]  there's a section in there on complementary and integrative medicine
[2:50:36.720 --> 2:50:41.840]  and your website on your surgery uh and the surgery is dadsagain.com for
[2:50:41.840 --> 2:50:46.000]  best equity reversals interestingly i did have i've had several men who wanted
[2:50:46.000 --> 2:50:49.760]  a reversal and the sole reason was they wanted to restore their fertility
[2:50:49.760 --> 2:50:52.640]  for the kind of scenarios that you and your listeners talk about that's
[2:50:52.640 --> 2:50:55.920]  interesting okay uh stay with us there i want to ask you on the other side we'll
[2:50:55.920 --> 2:51:01.520]  be right back on the other side of this break
[2:51:01.520 --> 2:51:04.880]  a little over a year ago i began to do a lot of research
[2:51:04.880 --> 2:51:08.640]  into why even if i had a pretty good size meal that i was still starving
[2:51:08.640 --> 2:51:12.880]  and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we
[2:51:12.880 --> 2:51:16.080]  grow our crops on here in the united states and across the industrialized
[2:51:16.080 --> 2:51:20.240]  world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key
[2:51:20.240 --> 2:51:24.480]  minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves
[2:51:24.480 --> 2:51:28.400]  fight off cancer and be healthy i've been searched out the best

[2:54:20.080 --> 2:54:24.320]  oh we're over here okay um and he's still on the line with us to answer this
[2:54:24.320 --> 2:54:27.840]  last question about well he said he said right before the break that a lot of
[2:54:27.840 --> 2:54:30.560]  people are showing up and wanting to have vasectomy
[2:54:30.560 --> 2:54:34.800]  reversals to restore fertility in preparation for a collapse
[2:54:34.800 --> 2:54:37.040]  scenario or what what might be happening ahead
[2:54:37.040 --> 2:54:40.240]  uh dr marx you still on the on the line yeah i'm still here can you give us
[2:54:40.240 --> 2:54:43.120]  more information about that i mean that people are doing that is
[2:54:43.120 --> 2:54:46.400]  interesting yeah usually most pick upals that come to us
[2:54:46.400 --> 2:54:50.240]  it's to restore fertility after a divorce a loss of a child just to change
[2:54:50.240 --> 2:54:53.760]  a heart but we've had a fair number of guys who came to us from around the
[2:54:53.760 --> 2:54:57.760]  country and actually internationally and some of them are married some of them
[2:54:57.760 --> 2:55:00.320]  were single and and we always say you know what's
[2:55:00.320 --> 2:55:02.960]  the reason for wanting this vasectomy reversal
[2:55:02.960 --> 2:55:06.640]  and several have said i just want to have my fertility restored for just in
[2:55:06.640 --> 2:55:08.960]  case i just think that's going to be a potential
[2:55:08.960 --> 2:55:12.400]  important thing and i want to have that option on the table
[2:55:12.400 --> 2:55:15.280]  all right well that's good to know it's one way to fight back against bill
[2:55:15.280 --> 2:55:19.040]  gates and the globalists you know have children instead of depopulating the
[2:55:19.040 --> 2:55:21.760]  planet which is something that we cover here on

[2:55:37.680 --> 2:55:41.920]  called conspiracy cards sent me a set and i just thought they were so cool
[2:55:41.920 --> 2:55:46.320]  i want to share them with you i don't know if you can get a document shot but
[2:55:46.320 --> 2:55:50.720]  these are these are cards that you can hand to people that explain each of the
[2:55:50.720 --> 2:55:54.000]  top the the major conspiracies like here's one on fluoride
[2:55:54.000 --> 2:55:57.760]  that just breaks it down you can hand it to somebody here learn about fluoride
[2:55:57.760 --> 2:56:01.200]  here's one on on food here's the depopulation agenda

[3:00:21.760 --> 3:00:25.840]  hi mike um thank you so much again for covering all of your food freedom
[3:00:25.840 --> 3:00:30.720]  issues i just kind of as an as an open-ended question i actually had
[3:00:30.720 --> 3:00:34.480]  some specific ones for the good doctor and uh and your
[3:00:34.480 --> 3:00:38.480]  your other guests on fairness but for you specifically
[3:00:38.480 --> 3:00:42.960]  what how do you feel what would you gauge the uh
[3:00:42.960 --> 3:00:50.480]  interest to be in doing a uh freedom palooza or any other
[3:00:50.480 --> 3:00:56.000]  kind of a rock and roll mixed with um um a festival of speakers if if
[3:00:56.000 --> 3:01:00.160]  if you and someone like greg palest and um
[3:01:00.160 --> 3:01:06.480]  rosa carry and um um naomi wolf were at an event i would travel across the
[3:01:06.480 --> 3:01:09.760]  country go and see you would you be open to that
[3:01:09.760 --> 3:01:13.040]  hey i i would travel to go see something like that too
[3:01:13.040 --> 3:01:16.400]  um the thing is i'm not i'm not traveling by air
[3:01:16.400 --> 3:01:21.840]  because of the tsa you know you saw my tsa help wanted satire video they got
[3:01:21.840 --> 3:01:26.400]  censored by youtube and yeah i have no no doubt those guys who try to put a
[3:01:26.400 --> 3:01:30.160]  little bag of fake cocaine in my luggage if they get a chance so i'm not i'm not
[3:01:30.160 --> 3:01:32.880]  giving them the opportunity and i don't think alex is traveling by air
[3:01:32.880 --> 3:01:37.760]  right now either is he so um a lot of us are really not
[3:01:37.760 --> 3:01:41.200]  able to get somewhere unless we can do it by road but if it's if it's somewhere
[3:01:41.200 --> 3:01:45.600]  near texas that i could get to i would love to do something like that and i
[3:01:45.600 --> 3:01:49.360]  think it'd be really rocking a huge success
[3:01:49.360 --> 3:01:53.600]  you know i've never met naomi and uh i haven't met greg palestin person either
[3:01:53.600 --> 3:01:57.760]  those are two people that that i really admire would love to meet as well
[3:01:57.760 --> 3:02:02.400]  so i think it's a great idea man how about skype on a big screen
[3:02:02.400 --> 3:02:06.320]  i'm working with uh some fellows from we are change minnesota
[3:02:06.320 --> 3:02:10.080]  and some of the mitis resources guys and we are changed wisconsin
[3:02:10.080 --> 3:02:14.240]  put you on a big screen do it via skype and then you wouldn't have to travel
[3:02:14.240 --> 3:02:17.040]  hey i'm totally up for that in fact i do a lot of that already
[3:02:17.040 --> 3:02:20.560]  and so i'm happy i would be happy to promote an event like that
[3:02:20.560 --> 3:02:24.560]  as well as as be part of it via skype video that would be great
[3:02:24.560 --> 3:02:27.760]  it's also more secure because a lot of us guys
[3:02:27.760 --> 3:02:30.960]  and gals who are better known you know in the patriot movement
[3:02:30.960 --> 3:02:34.720]  we got to be mindful of security and so we don't necessarily like to surround
[3:02:34.720 --> 3:02:38.800]  ourselves with um you know public that we can't if we
[3:02:38.800 --> 3:02:42.400]  can't be safe about i mean we love to meet people we love to shake hands we
[3:02:42.400 --> 3:02:46.080]  love to get out there like i did last week in dallas and alex did
[3:02:46.080 --> 3:02:49.680]  just yesterday in dallas and next week in orlando but we also got to be safe
[3:02:49.680 --> 3:02:53.680]  about it because because you know there there are plenty of bad guys who don't
[3:02:53.680 --> 3:02:58.080]  want us to continue speaking freely
[3:02:58.080 --> 3:03:02.640]  not to get too far into detail if i i know exactly what you're talking about i
[3:03:02.640 --> 3:03:06.080]  have had some bad guys show up in the past and
[3:03:06.080 --> 3:03:10.400]  talking to their collars and all sorts of things at events that i've uh
[3:03:10.400 --> 3:03:15.200]  run or sponsored and or been at and uh so i know what you're talking about
[3:03:15.200 --> 3:03:19.680]  um and uh and believe me that that sentiment is not lost on me
[3:03:19.680 --> 3:03:24.560]  thanks again uh mike adams you are i love alex to death i listen to him
[3:03:24.560 --> 3:03:29.120]  every day and if i can't make it because my business i listen to the podcast

[3:03:43.440 --> 3:03:46.800]  and try to deliver a good show for you packed with information you know it's
[3:03:46.800 --> 3:03:49.920]  not just entertainment it's really a very usable practical
[3:03:49.920 --> 3:03:52.480]  information i hope you agree or i work hard to
[3:03:52.480 --> 3:03:55.760]  bring guests in here you know and i got to say too um
[3:03:55.760 --> 3:03:59.440]  i in in defense of alex jones and everything that he does
[3:03:59.440 --> 3:04:02.560]  you know from time to time there are there are snipes and trolls out there
[3:04:02.560 --> 3:04:07.200]  who take shots at him and uh they usually that's people who have
[3:04:07.200 --> 3:04:10.400]  never put in the hours they've never paid their dues they've never done the
[3:04:10.400 --> 3:04:13.840]  hard work that it takes to be an effective voice for freedom and
[3:04:13.840 --> 3:04:17.360]  liberty which alex is alex has earned his place

[3:04:29.920 --> 3:04:33.120]  uh really honor that but some of them don't and some of them
[3:04:33.120 --> 3:04:36.400]  don't appreciate that and and i think they're wrong in that they alex
[3:04:36.400 --> 3:04:39.520]  deserves credit he is leading he's the tip of the spear on the
[3:04:39.520 --> 3:04:43.120]  patriot movement and freedom of information in america and that's why
