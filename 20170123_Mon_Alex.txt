[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  This will be a day long remember. We've seen the end of the Clintons. We'll soon see the end of the globalist.
[00:09.000 --> 00:12.000]  Donald J. Trump is now president of the United States.
[00:12.000 --> 00:17.000]  It's not true. That's impossible.
[00:17.000 --> 00:45.000]  It's such a thing as you know it to true.
[00:45.000 --> 00:50.000]  This is the heart of 1776. You're a white male.
[00:50.000 --> 00:55.000]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[00:55.000 --> 00:59.000]  Move, bitch! Get out of the way!
[00:59.000 --> 01:05.000]  We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag.
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.000]  Info wars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.000]  There's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[01:14.000 --> 01:20.000]  I will not let you down. You'll be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[01:20.000 --> 01:22.000]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[01:22.000 --> 01:28.000]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th president of the United States.
[01:28.000 --> 01:34.000]  Waging war on corruption is Alex Jones.
[01:34.000 --> 01:43.000]  Well, for the globalists, the day of doom has come and for their dumbed-down slave minions, they are in complete panic.
[01:43.000 --> 01:46.000]  They are in open rebellion against our republic.
[01:46.000 --> 01:53.000]  They are in open warfare against this nation state and prosperity itself.
[01:53.000 --> 02:01.000]  There is a civil war taking place made up on their side by a bunch of miscreant, brain-dead bullies
[02:01.000 --> 02:07.000]  and on our side by people simply trying to resuscitate the republic.
[02:07.000 --> 02:10.000]  I've traveled quite a bit, but not as much as my reporters.
[02:10.000 --> 02:16.000]  And repeatedly, people come up to them and scream, you're an effing white male, you have no right to speak.
[02:16.000 --> 02:18.000]  Shut up, go away, and then assault them.
[02:18.000 --> 02:25.000]  And it's always a white man or a white woman.
[02:25.000 --> 02:31.000]  There's no irony lost on them that they're saying, you don't have a right to speak, you're an effing white male.
[02:31.000 --> 02:37.000]  Now, I thought that that was just age-scree-licks and a few other people that we caught on tape and then it became some meme.
[02:37.000 --> 02:47.000]  I didn't understand until I went to D.C., but it's also happened in Austin now in the last month, where people walk up to me and go,
[02:47.000 --> 02:58.000]  F-U, white male, you're the problem, white males, we're getting rid, and it's a white person saying this to you, but it's always a shriveled beta male
[02:58.000 --> 03:03.000]  that looks like they are a reanimated dead body.
[03:03.000 --> 03:08.000]  I mean, they look like concentration camp victims.
[03:08.000 --> 03:14.000]  They've almost got green skin, their eyes are dead, and they just see somebody, and I'm not saying I'm Mr. Super Alpha male,
[03:14.000 --> 03:22.000]  but I got tan skin and a big chest and a big neck, and I'm alive and happy, and they just see the fact that I'm happy and virile.
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.000]  And man, they see my good-looking kids, oh, they just go crazy.
[03:26.000 --> 03:29.000]  They just, it's horrible.
[03:29.000 --> 03:37.000]  And then I sat there, there's one video that's like 40 minutes long of the anti-male pro-world government march that took place on Saturday.
[03:37.000 --> 03:46.000]  I was leaving DC while it was starting from like 9 a.m. to noon, I was in the middle of it, and for 40-something minutes, I streamed the middle of it,
[03:46.000 --> 04:02.000]  and every 15 seconds, it's F-U, Alex Jones, and every minute or so, F-U, you're a white male with hatred that I would have for somebody if they say killed my kid.
[04:02.000 --> 04:10.000]  I mean, I'm talking women that were so hateful, and then they'd say, with just total hate in their faces, hate not love!
[04:10.000 --> 04:18.000]  Excuse me, I was being honest about what they were really doing. Love not hate! Love conquers all! Love counts hate!
[04:18.000 --> 04:23.000]  Oh, excuse me, F-U white male!
[04:23.000 --> 04:26.000]  And we're going to take these videos and analyze them and just clip it together.
[04:26.000 --> 04:35.000]  I mean, I've got hours total over the three days I was there of F-U white male, and these are completely whacked out crazy people.
[04:35.000 --> 04:45.000]  And they were attacking Millie, they were attacking Owen Shroyer, and they would attack and then say, don't be hateful, we love you.
[04:45.000 --> 04:53.000]  I mean folks, these are crazy people, and they are total slaves, and they believe everything.
[04:53.000 --> 05:00.000]  They believe that Martin Luther King's bust has been taken out of the White House. They believe all the lies they're fed, they're victims.
[05:24.000 --> 05:27.000]  And the election of Donald Trump is the pill you have to swallow.
[05:27.000 --> 05:32.000]  You need to know your douchebag sense of entitlement is so palpable that it makes you the ugliest person in the room.
[05:32.000 --> 05:39.000]  And if you don't come off your self-made soapbox now, you will soon be the most lonely, desperate, desolate people on earth.
[05:39.000 --> 05:47.000]  Donald Trump is your president. The reality is, Donald Trump is the president, America elected him, and we're here to make America great again.
[05:47.000 --> 05:51.000]  Make Planet Earth great again, expose the fake news media, and change the world.
[05:51.000 --> 05:55.000]  You can either join us or be a humorous footnote in world history.
[05:55.000 --> 05:58.000]  Thanks to everyone so much for the love shown over the course of this journey.
[05:58.000 --> 06:22.000]  Donald Trump is our president. Now let's get to work.

[08:22.000 --> 08:51.000]  I'm not your slave, New World Order.
[08:51.000 --> 09:13.000]  A lot of times the strongest are actually noble and don't want to enslave people, but it is many times the servile minions of evil that actually enjoy power and want to control everybody's language, reproductive rights, and the entire system of the culture.
[09:13.000 --> 09:35.000]  They're breaking up our families. They're trying to impoverish us. It's all admitted. It's all by design. And humanity worldwide is awakening to it, and there is an explosion in the rediscovery of basic human systems, not values, but systems of men and women and families and sovereignty and free market and free association.
[09:35.000 --> 09:54.000]  Humanity hit the bottom in 2016, and humanity began to come back up towards the surface for air on January 20, 2017.
[09:54.000 --> 10:12.000]  Trump and Bannon and others and myself are truly intending a new global renaissance and massive human empowerment. This is completely real. That's why the forces of evil are crapping their drawers.
[10:12.000 --> 10:29.000]  There are hundreds of articles a day saying that Trump is challenging world order, and their new spin is that the end of the American century is here. No, the globalists said this was the Chinese century. Now it'll be the American millennium. Just watch.
[10:29.000 --> 10:46.000]  Russia has analyzed this, and now their best people look at it, and they know it's genuine, and is deciding to link up with it. Japan is linking up with it. And for the first time since before World War II, Japan is announcing it's going to do fair trade deals now,
[10:46.000 --> 10:59.000]  because Trump wants to really be a partner and not a group dominating Japan. And Japan that has been manipulated by the globalists for decades and told to screw over America is now announcing a reversal of that operation.
[10:59.000 --> 11:17.000]  This is so incredible. I'm getting chills on top of chills right now. Now let me tell you, they are allowing Madonna, who's one of the main spokespersons for Soren or the Illuminati, for the enemy to come out and call for the bombing and death of Trump.
[11:17.000 --> 11:34.000]  What an ugly harpy trying to pretend she's a young teeny bopper. Secret Service will investigate Madonna after Singer says she wants to blow up the winehouse. Lady, you're pushing people for insurrection in war.
[11:34.000 --> 11:56.000]  When the Civil War starts, you're now in a man's world. You are a combatant. And you're fair game, sweetheart. So you call for the death of the man that would restore not just the Republic, but the planet on a godly course of freedom.
[11:56.000 --> 12:07.000]  Let's just say people that actually do things don't make threats, but we know what you're trying to do. And you know this.
[12:07.000 --> 12:19.000]  If you are ever successful or any of your minions are successful, there's not going to be anywhere on earth you can hide which so you want to get in the arena.
[12:19.000 --> 12:30.000]  Back the jihadi so she backs open borders and bringing in the most oppressive people on earth towards women. You are an old, ugly vampire.
[12:30.000 --> 12:37.000]  And by the way, I love old people. I'm not knocking women that are old. I'm saying she's an old, evil witch like woman trying to be the young girl.
[12:37.000 --> 12:47.000]  It's directly out of archetypal fairy tales like Snow White. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Who is the fairest of them all?
[12:47.000 --> 12:56.000]  The truth is your true form is now being revealed. Just look at that person completely turned over to evil.
[12:56.000 --> 13:05.000]  Camille Paglia blast Madonna's humiliating decline, embarrassing inability to deal with aging. Yes, it's what really marks a woman.
[13:05.000 --> 13:16.000]  Can they age gracefully and then be strong and convert their timeless beauty into the actions and helping their family and others?
[13:16.000 --> 13:23.000]  Or do they turn into a evil witch? Well, we know which way Madonna went.
[13:23.000 --> 13:30.000]  Let me just do this. It's a complete overwhelm. It's so hard to even cover all this.
[13:30.000 --> 13:40.000]  Trump comes out and I'm sitting there on the elliptical this morning watching it and for 40 minutes with no teleprompter just lays out total veritas.
[13:40.000 --> 13:46.000]  But there's all these unfair trade deals. He lists them specifically and he says, listen, we're just going to equalize whatever they're doing,
[13:46.000 --> 13:50.000]  but we're going to have zero tax and zero tariffs domestically.
[13:50.000 --> 13:58.000]  So have 50 beautiful, one veritable states to have competition in and anybody that equalizes trade with us, then we will equalize with them.
[13:58.000 --> 14:04.000]  But everybody thinks we're a joke because it's all so one-sided.
[14:04.000 --> 14:14.000]  The Heritage Foundation and all these groups lie to everyone and say that free trade is China with massive tariffs on us and us with no tariffs on them.
[14:14.000 --> 14:20.000]  Let me tell you what a real tariff is. It's Obama saying you can build a coal power plant or have one, but we're going to shut you down.
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.000]  We're going to bankrupt you.
[14:23.000 --> 14:34.000]  Trump comes in and says we're going to slash regulations 75%. I've talked to all the major business leaders and they want tax cuts and they're going to get those and the middle class is going to get those.
[14:34.000 --> 14:38.000]  And the poorest Americans just won't have any more taxes.
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.000]  But he said everyone almost 100% say we want the regulations out of it. Absolutely.
[14:42.000 --> 14:49.000]  Where I live in Austin, Texas, it's almost as bad as San Francisco with regulations. That's just the city.
[14:49.000 --> 15:00.000]  I have family that the city for six months won't give them the occupancy letter to be able to move into the house they rebuilt.
[15:00.000 --> 15:07.000]  Obama went from coal's top cheerleader to its number one enemy. That's right. That's all part of his deception, his manipulation.
[15:07.000 --> 15:17.000]  Cutting off our power. People go, I don't own any coal stock. It was over half our energy just eight years ago. It's 25% of it now because it's expensive or it's not available.
[15:17.000 --> 15:23.000]  You wonder why there's not jobs. Energy is the oxygen of the economy. Period.
[15:23.000 --> 15:31.000]  If you don't have a tank of oxygen, whether you're a foot under the water and can't get up to the surface or 100 feet, you will die in four minutes.
[15:31.000 --> 15:44.000]  If you don't have readily available cheap energy, you're done in an industrialized world. They were turning off the lights for everyone but themselves in a consolidation, a greedy, horrible consolidation.
[15:44.000 --> 15:53.000]  And as Trump said, it's not reasonable. And it's reasonable for us to have a demand of a real economy and it's easy.
[15:53.000 --> 15:58.000]  They admit in the white papers that they're trying to tie down the economy.
[15:58.000 --> 16:08.000]  But out of everything I'm going to cover today and there is so much, the biggest news was near the end of his 22 minute speech on Friday.
[16:08.000 --> 16:15.000]  And I was there like 70 yards below as he gave that speech. It was so historical.
[16:15.000 --> 16:21.000]  And it was so on target. I knew it was true. I knew he was true blue.
[16:21.000 --> 16:27.000]  I just could not believe the total reversal and the fact that I ever doubted Trump.
[16:27.000 --> 16:34.000]  My gut, my spirit didn't, but now it was just pouring through my flesh that this is a treasure.
[16:34.000 --> 16:39.000]  And no wonder every evil enemy hates him just as they hate me.
[16:39.000 --> 16:46.000]  And just as they hate you, you bitter clingers in flyover country.
[16:46.000 --> 16:52.000]  Ashley Beckford, a great reporter and researcher and video editor, said we first hired her, but then she's great at reporting.
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.000]  She also has courage and that's really what you need.
[16:54.000 --> 16:57.000]  She went down to the women's march. They just say they speak for women. George Soros does.
[16:57.000 --> 17:05.000]  And he funded almost every organization that brought the people out and exercise of database control. They put their people on the street.
[17:05.000 --> 17:16.000]  And they called her an Uncle Tom, just as they did months ago, even before Trump had won.
[17:16.000 --> 17:19.000]  It's just crazy. They're the nastiest, most hateful people ever.
[17:19.000 --> 17:32.000]  I was called a white male at least 300 times by white women or little weird beta scrawny guys screaming at me.
[17:32.000 --> 17:37.000]  I hate you, you effing white male. You're the cause of all the problems.
[17:37.000 --> 17:46.000]  I mean, that is the 180 degree difference from what Martin Luther King said that you judge people by what they do, what they stand for and what they produce.
[17:46.000 --> 17:53.000]  And the character, this is the most racist, hateful. They're so cartoonish.
[17:53.000 --> 17:57.000]  And I don't say they were ugly and skinny and zip covered. I felt bad for them.
[17:57.000 --> 18:03.000]  I mean, if there'd been like 30% of them like that, I didn't see one male that looked as strong as I did.
[18:03.000 --> 18:07.000]  I didn't see any of them that looked as half as manly as I did.
[18:07.000 --> 18:16.000]  And then I looked around with like the war hero security I've got and Navy SEALs, and I'm going to leave it at that.
[18:16.000 --> 18:20.000]  And they looked like twice as tough as I am. And then I look at them.
[18:20.000 --> 18:26.000]  These people are like, I could have taken on 50 of these guys. I mean, easily, easily.
[18:26.000 --> 18:33.000]  And I'm not just saying that. I mean, I know.
[18:33.000 --> 18:37.000]  I mean, I've gotten in brawls where you beat down one guy and two more getting on you.
[18:37.000 --> 18:43.000]  And the point is, I mean, maybe a hundred. They were so weak and so shriveled and so dead looking.
[18:43.000 --> 18:48.000]  It was like a science fiction movie. Like some interdimensional spider had sucked their soul out.
[18:48.000 --> 18:52.000]  Man, I'm scared. I've never been scared. We're going to skip this break until now.
[18:52.000 --> 18:56.000]  And I was scared for them because it's like they're demon possessed folks.
[18:56.000 --> 19:00.000]  It's like we're in a sci-fi movie. And the women were like these bloated, hateful.
[19:00.000 --> 19:04.000]  And the faces they would make were so demonic.
[19:04.000 --> 19:09.000]  They'd go, yeah, white bear, yeah. I mean, I call them goblins because they are.
[19:09.000 --> 19:12.000]  We've got the videos. A lot of you watched them live.
[19:12.000 --> 19:15.000]  We're going to get the clips and slow them down. And then they, yeah.
[19:15.000 --> 19:17.000]  I mean, other people take those pictures and show those, but I don't care.
[19:17.000 --> 19:22.000]  That's what they do. They deceive. They say, he took the Martin Luther King bust out.
[19:22.000 --> 19:28.000]  And they show the crowd at 830 when the police hadn't even opened up the barricades, letting anybody in yet.
[19:28.000 --> 19:34.000]  And they go, look, nobody showed up for his crowd. Trump comes out, counters him, shows you the biggest crowd ever.
[19:34.000 --> 19:43.000]  And they come out on the news and say, well, CNN says, well, we know Hitler had big crowds.
[19:43.000 --> 19:48.000]  And he went to the CIA Memorial in Lainley at the CIA to speak.
[19:48.000 --> 19:53.000]  And it was just incredible.
[19:53.000 --> 19:59.000]  Now, if you're a TV viewer, most of you have already seen this, but a radio listeners all describe it.
[19:59.000 --> 20:02.000]  They showed it. They were smart. They didn't show it.
[20:02.000 --> 20:07.000]  When it was totally shut and all the checkpoints were shut so you couldn't get in down Pennsylvania Avenue,
[20:07.000 --> 20:11.000]  they waited till they just opened it.
[20:11.000 --> 20:14.000]  And I mean, because this happened like five minutes after they'd opened it,
[20:14.000 --> 20:20.000]  showed that there were still some crowds that looked like little, little circles.
[20:20.000 --> 20:25.000]  But of course, then it completely filled up, even though there were Black Lives Matter and all these sorrow groups
[20:25.000 --> 20:28.000]  beating people up at the entrances and the police were letting them do it.
[20:28.000 --> 20:34.000]  But just think of how evil the media is that they ran this deception and they had people in the airports,
[20:34.000 --> 20:41.000]  to me and to my crew, who flew another flight saying, your losers, haha, we saw the photos.
[20:41.000 --> 20:43.000]  No one showed up for your rally.
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.000]  And they're still running this.
[20:45.000 --> 20:50.000]  CNN last night was still saying Trump didn't have a big crowd,
[20:50.000 --> 20:54.000]  even though the Metro and all the evidence shows the biggest crowd ever.
[20:54.000 --> 21:00.000]  But I mean, and then when Trump defends it and shows the truth,
[21:00.000 --> 21:03.000]  they say, oh, he's arrogant and is always defending himself.
[21:03.000 --> 21:06.000]  Yes, this is a process of exposing what sort of all liars you are.
[21:06.000 --> 21:13.000]  But he goes to CNN, Freudian slip, same group, CIA.
[21:13.000 --> 21:15.000]  And people are sick of the tyranny.
[21:15.000 --> 21:17.000]  They're sick of the evil standing ovations.
[21:17.000 --> 21:22.000]  And then they cut back to CNN and the host is like, look at him in that hallowed ground.
[21:22.000 --> 21:29.000]  Who does he think he is even being there at that memorial area when these CIA people don't like him?
[21:29.000 --> 21:32.000]  And it was the total opposite of him just getting standing ovations.
[21:32.000 --> 21:38.000]  And they cut to how dare the president of the United States visit the CIA.
[21:38.000 --> 21:39.000]  Who the hell does he think he is?
[21:39.000 --> 21:46.000]  I'm telling you, the propaganda is so dumb and none of it makes any sense.
[21:46.000 --> 21:50.000]  But see, they've green-lighted the media, do whatever you want, be as nasty as you want.
[21:50.000 --> 21:54.000]  And they're for a spirit of keeping us poor and dominating and being bullies.
[21:54.000 --> 21:57.000]  So they've been hired because they go along with that.
[21:57.000 --> 22:00.000]  And so it kind of accelerates the recruitment of more scum.
[22:00.000 --> 22:03.000]  And they're led by a bunch of pedophiles at the top.
[22:03.000 --> 22:04.000]  We all know that.
[22:04.000 --> 22:07.000]  And so this is what evil looks like so I can tell you.
[22:07.000 --> 22:11.000]  There is a great spirit of wickedness that was in these people.
[22:11.000 --> 22:15.000]  And after they lost, they really showed their fangs and who they are.
[22:15.000 --> 22:21.000]  And they are now running around bullying and screaming and getting in everybody's face everywhere.
[22:21.000 --> 22:26.000]  And that's why it's important for all of us not to go back to sleep but to redouble our efforts.
[22:26.000 --> 22:34.000]  I told my crew when Trump won, I said, I want you to bring back him the guy that builds the ESPN studios, the Fox News studios, you name it,
[22:34.000 --> 22:36.000]  in this warehouse here that we just cleared out.
[22:36.000 --> 22:38.000]  I want a giant war room.
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  We're going to call it the war room.
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.000]  And I'm going to do daily briefings in there.
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.000]  And I'm going to start a whole new show every day.
[22:44.000 --> 22:45.000]  I'm going to work more now.
[22:45.000 --> 22:48.000]  And I'm going to try to create even more reporters and people.
[22:48.000 --> 22:56.000]  And we're going to live time with like screens, analyze lies as they're happening and fact check as they're happening.
[22:56.000 --> 22:58.000]  And I said, we're going to call it the war room.
[22:58.000 --> 23:00.000]  Now that was internally.
[23:00.000 --> 23:12.000]  David Brock, the main democratic ground level strategist for the Soros operation has announced that they are moving to impeach Trump.
[23:12.000 --> 23:21.000]  They're setting up a new operation center called the war room to wage war against Trump and to move for the impeachment of Trump.
[23:21.000 --> 23:22.000]  It begins.
[23:22.000 --> 23:29.000]  David Brock far left donors planned Trump impeachment and you can see now they were arrogant believing their own propaganda that was meant for the
[23:29.000 --> 23:34.000]  weak-minded public to just stand down or believe it when Hillary stole it, believe that it was real.
[23:34.000 --> 23:41.000]  Now that they figure out how bad they got beat, they are charging back with at least, now listen to me carefully, 10 times the energy.
[23:41.000 --> 23:46.000]  They couldn't get hardly any of their people out on the streets before because they were so arrogant believing they were invincible.
[23:46.000 --> 23:50.000]  They said a half million women at the streets, usually the media lies.
[23:50.000 --> 23:52.000]  It was over a million.
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  The Trump crowds estimated about 1.8 million.
[23:54.000 --> 23:56.000]  It was over a million women.
[23:56.000 --> 23:59.000]  Nobody was trying to block them going into Pennsylvania Avenue.
[23:59.000 --> 24:00.000]  Nobody was trying to stop them.
[24:00.000 --> 24:04.000]  Nobody was beating them up like they were doing to us.
[24:04.000 --> 24:08.000]  But and they were just so stupid.
[24:08.000 --> 24:11.000]  Most of them we try to talk to them could hardly talk.
[24:11.000 --> 24:22.000]  They were either really young and really stupid or they were just hateful old women with men in tow that would all walk behind them and take their orders.
[24:22.000 --> 24:31.000]  So it's a total inversion of reality and just the caricature of what they claimed that men were doing oppressing women.
[24:31.000 --> 24:35.000]  They are now going to do it to quote men.
[24:35.000 --> 24:38.000]  But then there's a twist to all that.
[24:38.000 --> 24:48.000]  There was a globalist double-cross plan to carry out 9-11 with Saudi Arabia to then take over the Middle East, take out Islam's non-radical enemies,
[24:48.000 --> 24:52.000]  then open up Europe and the United States, bring in the jihad and make us conform to them.
[24:52.000 --> 24:56.000]  But that plan has basically been exposed.
[24:56.000 --> 25:01.000]  But that's why I said on the live stream Saturday in the middle of them screaming and cussing at me,
[25:01.000 --> 25:07.000]  because there were so many Islamic men and so many Islamic women wearing hijabs and holding up signs of women in a red, white, and blue hijab.
[25:07.000 --> 25:11.000]  I said, I bet this is going to be Islamic funded as one of the biggest groups.
[25:11.000 --> 25:19.000]  Turns out the biggest group there, funded by Soros, is a Sharia law group saying women need the freedom of being under Sharia law.
[25:19.000 --> 25:26.000]  I got home and they had the woman on CNN saying, we're going to bring Sharia and freedom to women.
[25:26.000 --> 25:33.000]  They're flipping the script. They're going from denying all this to openly activating.
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.000]  I mean, who could make that up?
[25:35.000 --> 25:41.000]  And we would say to women, you know, the Islamists that Hillary and Kerry and Obama turned loose,
[25:41.000 --> 25:45.000]  have enslaved hundreds of thousands of women, killed hundreds of thousands, sex slavery.
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.000]  They go, no, that's not, that's Trump.
[25:47.000 --> 25:50.000]  There's an interview with Millie, does one, and she brings it up to them.
[25:50.000 --> 25:54.000]  She goes, well, Hillary is the main, one-fifth of her money came from Saudi Arabia.
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  That's admitted.
[25:56.000 --> 25:59.000]  And they go, no, that's not true. Trump got way more. He's way richer.
[25:59.000 --> 26:02.000]  They just have no connection, no understanding.
[26:02.000 --> 26:07.000]  I mean, it is crazy. Women's March organizer recently met ex-Hamas operatives,
[26:07.000 --> 26:12.000]  has family ties to terror group, yeah, and pushes Sharia law for women.
[26:12.000 --> 26:14.000]  And then they bring her and others on CNN.
[26:14.000 --> 26:21.000]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[26:21.000 --> 26:26.000]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[26:26.000 --> 26:29.000]  Now, here's how Trump's going to beat them.
[26:29.000 --> 26:33.000]  They know this and it's why they're so scared.
[26:33.000 --> 26:37.000]  The United States is going to end up dominating the planet out of this,
[26:37.000 --> 26:42.000]  but not out of military force and not out of coercion, not out of dirty trick squads,
[26:42.000 --> 26:48.000]  but off of turning on the engine of liberty and deploying the incredibly advanced technologies
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.000]  that DARPA and our top scientists and others have developed,
[26:52.000 --> 26:55.000]  and that have also been stolen from everybody else,
[26:55.000 --> 27:00.000]  that were meant to be farmed out to select global corporations to destroy the nation state.
[27:00.000 --> 27:06.000]  Trump is planning on distributing these technologies fairly to everyone,
[27:06.000 --> 27:10.000]  but having the United States have the key dominant role,
[27:10.000 --> 27:12.000]  because we built it all.
[27:12.000 --> 27:16.000]  The UK, Germany, and the US, if you want to get down to it, like 90% of it, everything, okay?
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.000]  And in France, others were involved, but if you got the main engine of innovation,
[27:20.000 --> 27:24.000]  and the Japanese and Chinese went a lot too, but nobody can deny,
[27:24.000 --> 27:28.000]  the internet, all of it, atomic weapons, it just goes on and on.
[27:28.000 --> 27:30.000]  We're the leaders.
[27:30.000 --> 27:33.000]  And instead of this all being shelved as disruptive technology,
[27:33.000 --> 27:37.000]  Trump is preparing to roll it out.
[27:37.000 --> 27:44.000]  Now, they're desperate because they're going to kill tyranny with prosperity.
[27:44.000 --> 27:48.000]  And ladies and gentlemen,
[27:48.000 --> 27:52.000]  you can't say it's the cure for cancer because some of these are so fast-moving and so deadly,
[27:52.000 --> 27:56.000]  and some people's physiology don't take to some of the treatments that have been suppressed.
[27:56.000 --> 28:00.000]  But yes, ladies and gentlemen, they have serious treatments that will pretty much,
[28:00.000 --> 28:06.000]  as we know it, make cancer be seen as something like polio that's completely eradicated in the West.
[28:06.000 --> 28:09.000]  And Trump knows they're putting it in the vaccine.
[28:09.000 --> 28:12.000]  He knows instead of curing it, they're giving it to people.
[28:12.000 --> 28:13.000]  That's been declassified.
[28:13.000 --> 28:14.000]  Trump knows everything.
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.000]  I told you he'd come out against the vaccines.
[28:16.000 --> 28:26.000]  A lot of that science isn't okay. It has some side effects. They're Trojan horsing it.
[28:26.000 --> 28:28.000]  Trump has goodwill.
[28:28.000 --> 28:32.000]  Trump is loving and strong and just a good person.
[28:32.000 --> 28:35.000]  And it seems like unthinkable, but he's a hard-nosed business guy.
[28:35.000 --> 28:36.000]  He's an alpha male.
[28:36.000 --> 28:37.000]  He's a strong guy.
[28:37.000 --> 28:40.000]  People push him around, runs over his competition.
[28:40.000 --> 28:51.000]  But Donald Trump knows that even in his family can be touched by these bad vaccines that this is pure evil.
[28:51.000 --> 28:53.000]  And we've prayed for it. We've hoped for it. We've worked for it.
[28:53.000 --> 28:54.000]  Let's be clear.
[28:54.000 --> 29:02.000]  Info wars in our audience created the atmosphere and the global movement at the right time
[29:02.000 --> 29:07.000]  to totally discredit globalism right as it began to go off the launchpad.
[29:07.000 --> 29:11.000]  As I've told you for 20 years, we're going to expose it.
[29:11.000 --> 29:13.000]  We're going to warn people about it.
[29:13.000 --> 29:14.000]  They're going to laugh at us.
[29:14.000 --> 29:15.000]  They're going to attack us.
[29:15.000 --> 29:19.000]  But as soon as they begin to go operational and turn the world economy off and go out
[29:19.000 --> 29:26.000]  for the family and announce their world government, when their system is on the launchpad with primary ignition,
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  the public will wake up.
[29:28.000 --> 29:38.000]  There'll be a huge brush fire of consciousness and then our big artillery guns will load
[29:38.000 --> 29:40.000]  and blow that ship up on the tarmac.
[29:40.000 --> 29:43.000]  And right now it's on fire. It's blowing up right now.
[29:43.000 --> 29:46.000]  I mean, it is exploding in front of your eyes.
[29:46.000 --> 29:47.000]  It came quicker than I thought.
[29:47.000 --> 29:50.000]  We are blowing it to pieces right now.
[29:50.000 --> 30:01.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:01.000 --> 30:05.000]  Well, it's no secret that Hillary Clinton is the one that coined the term deplorables
[30:05.000 --> 30:08.000]  and that we stole it, ran with it and now owned it.
[30:08.000 --> 30:13.000]  But let's recap some of the behavior we saw over the past election and at the inauguration.
[30:13.000 --> 30:16.000]  People protesting Trump were assaulting reporters,
[30:16.000 --> 30:20.000]  burning limos, smashing buildings, throwing stink bombs,
[30:20.000 --> 30:23.000]  disrupting the inauguration and other events that were happening,
[30:23.000 --> 30:26.000]  blocking streets, cursing at reporters.
[30:26.000 --> 30:30.000]  At the Women's March you had people on the stage cursing repeatedly,
[30:30.000 --> 30:34.000]  talking about Felatio on air, saying Trump can Felatio himself,
[30:34.000 --> 30:39.000]  threatening to bomb the White House, wearing pussy hats, spitting on people.
[30:39.000 --> 30:42.000]  How about all the assassination threats we've seen on Twitter?
[30:42.000 --> 30:47.000]  I'm not seeing any of that from Trump supporters, so after all, who are the real deplorables?
[30:47.000 --> 30:49.000]  I've said it once and I'll say it again.
[30:49.000 --> 30:53.000]  When they go low, they go really, really low.
[30:53.000 --> 30:56.000]  This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com.
[30:56.000 --> 31:23.000]  Real news, fake deplorable.

[32:01.000 --> 32:05.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, our show is here on the road with a very important announcement.
[32:05.000 --> 32:13.000]  Roger Stone's new book that is coming out in a couple of weeks is exclusively available at pre-order at InfowarsStore.com.
[32:13.000 --> 32:16.000]  It's the making of a president and it breaks down how Trump really got elected.
[32:16.000 --> 32:23.000]  The inside baseball, the current battles and a blueprint for the future and what Trump and others are really planning to do to restore the Republican prosperity.
[32:23.000 --> 32:27.000]  The bottom line, this is the book that got Roger Stone poisoned with polonium.
[32:27.000 --> 32:33.000]  It breaks down what really happened with the Russians and so much more and it supports him and it supports Infowars and our whole operation.
[32:33.000 --> 32:38.000]  So it's essential that this book go to the top of the charts in the political area, if not to the very top of the charts.
[32:38.000 --> 32:41.000]  Joe Biden has come out and said world government is collapsing.
[32:41.000 --> 32:47.000]  They're in full crisis mode, national movements are exploding, everybody needs to go pre-order.
[32:47.000 --> 32:49.000]  So you get it first at InfowarsStore.com.
[32:49.000 --> 32:51.000]  The making of a president by Roger Stone.
[32:51.000 --> 32:52.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[32:52.000 --> 32:54.000]  I'm going on airplane to go to the inaugural event with Trump.
[32:54.000 --> 32:58.000]  Pray for us and please continue to support the operation and get his book.
[32:58.000 --> 33:18.000]  Now sir, the first to have a trip to you.
[33:18.000 --> 33:23.000]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[33:23.000 --> 33:32.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:32.000 --> 33:52.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to roll through the news here obviously and break down the big picture because we've got a truly demoralized, brainwashed, servile group of state worshipers.
[33:52.000 --> 34:05.000]  Who just live such bizarre, domesticated, weak lives that they see those of us that aren't domesticated and those of us that are alive as the enemies.
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.000]  They want to get rid of us.
[34:07.000 --> 34:15.000]  There could be one of us left on the earth that these zombies hadn't pulled down and basically turned into one of them that they would allow us to survive.
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  They wouldn't let one of us be left.
[34:17.000 --> 34:19.000]  I mean, it's totally spiritual.
[34:19.000 --> 34:23.000]  And I've always known this, but when I saw it in DC, I was hurt.
[34:23.000 --> 34:27.000]  I didn't think, wow, our opposition looks like hell.
[34:27.000 --> 34:33.000]  I was looking all over the place and I couldn't find any of them that didn't look like they were half dead.
[34:33.000 --> 34:35.000]  Young old, you name it.
[34:35.000 --> 34:47.000]  Now, during the Trump event right before the inauguration, I did see some attractive women and people, but they were always like really weird, wimpy guys that were giggling and laughing.
[34:47.000 --> 34:50.000]  And I'd say, come on over to the camera. Just tell me what you think.
[34:50.000 --> 34:54.000]  They go, no, and just start laughing and were like mentally ill.
[34:54.000 --> 34:59.000]  And I could tell the women, and I'm not saying this to brag, were attracted to me.
[34:59.000 --> 35:06.000]  But they'd be looking like they're attracted to me, but then just looking like I was evil and then shake their head and just walk off like they were in a trance or something.
[35:06.000 --> 35:08.000]  It was really, really bizarre.
[35:08.000 --> 35:11.000]  I mean, to see and then to see the Trump supporters.
[35:11.000 --> 35:18.000]  I mean, the black Trump supporters were like the best dressed, most articulate people and people would say, oh, they're black, they're saying articulate.
[35:18.000 --> 35:20.000]  No, I'm saying more articulate than me.
[35:20.000 --> 35:21.000]  See, that's your racism.
[35:21.000 --> 35:25.000]  When I say some black guy was a really great speaker, it was because he was a really great speaker.
[35:25.000 --> 35:32.000]  The way his voice sounded, the way he looked, what he said was better than what I said.
[35:32.000 --> 35:34.000]  I wasn't patting a black guy on the head.
[35:34.000 --> 35:36.000]  I was saying what I said.
[35:36.000 --> 35:39.000]  See, everything they've got geared where we can't ever come together.
[35:39.000 --> 35:43.000]  They're even teaching if some white person tells a black person, they think they're really cool.
[35:43.000 --> 35:45.000]  That's because they're racists.
[35:45.000 --> 35:48.000]  They've got everything geared to keep us each other's throats.
[35:48.000 --> 35:49.000]  Let me get back to what I said.
[35:49.000 --> 35:56.000]  The Indians that we spoke to were the most eloquent, smart, fiery, focused people I've ever seen.
[35:56.000 --> 36:03.000]  The black Trump supporters just had power in their eyes.
[36:03.000 --> 36:12.000]  The Hillary supporters looked completely freaked out and, like, they were lost puppies, just totally freaked out and going, I used to really like you.
[36:12.000 --> 36:14.000]  Now you're racist and I just hate you.
[36:14.000 --> 36:18.000]  If that's one of them attacking, I'm like, oh, but no, but you're good.
[36:18.000 --> 36:20.000]  I mean, it's like they're like mind controlled folks.
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.000]  This is crazy.
[36:22.000 --> 36:27.000]  And I'm just saying the black people I ran into were mainly confused, but not the white people.
[36:27.000 --> 36:33.000]  Man, they were whacked out of their minds.
[36:33.000 --> 36:35.000]  And then I was around the Trump supporters and I was almost embarrassed.
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  I was like, these people are all so good looking.
[36:37.000 --> 36:40.000]  I mean, I was like the 50th percentile in there.
[36:40.000 --> 36:41.000]  I'm not bad looking.
[36:41.000 --> 36:47.000]  They were just super handsome, super good looking, the Hispanics, the Asians, the everybody and you could feel it.
[36:47.000 --> 36:56.000]  I saw Chinese and Japanese people in the crowd all super nice dress, you know, super like crying when Trump was up there because they could feel it.
[36:56.000 --> 37:03.000]  The term they have in Japanese for the spirit or, you know, somebody's mojo, but they can really pick it up.
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.000]  They were just like, whoa.
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  Gee, it's beyond that.
[37:07.000 --> 37:09.000]  It's called another term.
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  The Japanese believe you get around somebody who's powerful.
[37:11.000 --> 37:17.000]  You can, by being around them, you actually pick up their, I forget what it's called, but you could really feel it.
[37:17.000 --> 37:19.000]  And it was amazing.
[37:19.000 --> 37:22.000]  And it was that crowd of people and Trump's up there.
[37:22.000 --> 37:32.000]  He's feeling it, he's receiving it as like a big dynamo generator to give us the confidence to break the spirit of evil and weakness that has broken this country's back.
[37:32.000 --> 37:38.000]  And we could see our back being healed and the sinew and the bone coming back together.
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  And the enemy is just, no.
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  I've poisoned your water.
[37:42.000 --> 37:43.000]  I've poisoned your food.
[37:43.000 --> 37:44.000]  I've poisoned your culture.
[37:44.000 --> 37:45.000]  It's all declassified.
[37:45.000 --> 37:46.000]  We've put poison art out there.
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.000]  We've tried to destroy your families.
[37:48.000 --> 37:55.000]  Now this, they are just howling, howling at the moment they thought they had us.
[37:55.000 --> 37:57.000]  And it just makes me want to work 25 hours a day.
[37:57.000 --> 37:58.000]  I mean, I'm not kidding.
[37:58.000 --> 38:04.000]  I just, this battle is so real.
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  Evil is so real.
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  We must defeat this.
[38:08.000 --> 38:15.000]  You know, Trump got the big briefing and the nuke codes before he walked out because they said the president of the United States.
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  He's the president and then he takes the oath.
[38:17.000 --> 38:31.000]  There's that transformational twilight or dawn moment that twilight or dawn between the old administration and the new.
[38:31.000 --> 38:32.000]  And Trump walks out.
[38:32.000 --> 38:33.000]  Trump goes in like this for the briefing.
[38:33.000 --> 38:37.000]  He comes out and was like, people are like, whoa, he looks shaken.
[38:37.000 --> 38:38.000]  Yeah, sure.
[38:38.000 --> 38:40.000]  There's a long term eugenics program.
[38:40.000 --> 38:41.000]  You've already been briefed on them.
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  I'm sure by some of the generals, but they've only got part of it.
[38:43.000 --> 38:49.000]  There's a species wide program going on and then he's going to get all the briefings now.
[38:49.000 --> 38:57.000]  And then Donald Trump is going to know what I've reverse engineered and more.
[38:57.000 --> 39:03.000]  You can look at his face when he talks about we're going to unlock the secrets of the universe.
[39:03.000 --> 39:08.000]  We're going to unlock the secrets to disease and illness and we're going to eradicate it.
[39:08.000 --> 39:12.000]  And you can see he looks like he's about to break down.
[39:12.000 --> 39:21.000]  He's the guy right at that moment because now he knows they're not going to keep it from him.
[39:21.000 --> 39:26.000]  Just like when JFK came in the presidency and they said, sir, there's an ongoing plan to blow up buildings in the U.S.
[39:26.000 --> 39:28.000]  and blame it on the Russians to start World War III.
[39:28.000 --> 39:31.000]  And there's a plan to survive in the bunkers, sir.
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  And he said, that's crazy.
[39:33.000 --> 39:40.000]  I'm firing these generals.
[39:40.000 --> 39:46.000]  Eisenhower had just said no to him and was all freaked out at his farewell address like beware of the military industrial complex.
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  He wasn't against the troops like the media says.
[39:48.000 --> 39:52.000]  He was against the people that had hijacked who were crazy.
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  L.L. Lemnitzer and others.
[39:54.000 --> 39:57.000]  Well, Trump just got those briefings.
[39:57.000 --> 40:00.000]  And I know what they are because I've studied the whole enemy plan.
[40:00.000 --> 40:04.000]  You know, the enemy in the 20s and 30s and 40s wrote about what they were going to build.
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.000]  They did it in the 1860s, too.
[40:06.000 --> 40:11.000]  I don't know how they got their advanced knowledge, but they said we've got to discover the double helix.
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  We've got to create biometrics to control everybody.
[40:13.000 --> 40:18.000]  We've got to begin social engineering through the food and water and through injections.
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  That's a quote.
[40:20.000 --> 40:22.000]  And they even wrote books on the whole plan.
[40:22.000 --> 40:25.000]  So when they were conceiving of it, it's all public.
[40:25.000 --> 40:28.000]  And then you can see the program was developed and set up.
[40:28.000 --> 40:34.000]  And so the strongest of us have already been really hurt by all this, but imagine what it's done to the weaker of us.
[40:34.000 --> 40:37.000]  It's turned them into these hordes.
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  God Almighty, man.
[40:39.000 --> 40:42.000]  It was horrifying.
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  My soul cried out for them.
[40:44.000 --> 40:52.000]  And I caught myself just saying, not even aggressive things, just loud things back to them about, I'm here to help you.
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.000]  Look at how you're with the jihadis.
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  Look how they're directing you.
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  There'd be guys that are a little Islamic jihad outfits.
[40:58.000 --> 40:59.000]  You're going to get it, Jones.
[40:59.000 --> 41:00.000]  Pop right up in my face.
[41:00.000 --> 41:04.000]  And I'd say, just, you know, is your brand of Islam leading this and enslaving women?
[41:04.000 --> 41:05.000]  You know, is it happening?
[41:05.000 --> 41:10.000]  And they would just like, look at me because they knew that I was right and looked embarrassed.
[41:10.000 --> 41:19.000]  Only the controllers looked embarrassed because they know what they're doing is going to damn their soul to hell.
[41:19.000 --> 41:25.000]  You got to have a certain IQ to be a controller and then you realize that you're going to be destroyed as well.
[41:25.000 --> 41:37.000]  And that you've been bullied from birth into this radical Islam and that you're part of something that's so anti-human.
[41:37.000 --> 41:44.000]  Now, I want to play this clip because I mentioned it, but this is the most important clip out of all of it.
[41:44.000 --> 41:54.000]  To say America first, it simply means our nation's built to take care of the people and give people a chance to grow and have initiatives and pride and ideas and true service.
[41:54.000 --> 42:03.000]  Not naked psychological warfare, declassified to divide us all and turn us into stupid slaves.
[42:03.000 --> 42:12.000]  And I look at the panic people still at their chairs, still at CNN, still at MSNBC.
[42:12.000 --> 42:16.000]  They're all being sold off soon because they couldn't deliver.
[42:16.000 --> 42:18.000]  And this is them desperately going, no, no, no.
[42:18.000 --> 42:19.000]  We'll beat them.
[42:19.000 --> 42:20.000]  We'll beat them.
[42:20.000 --> 42:28.000]  Their bosses are building, you know, thousand-acre compounds in Kauai like Zuckerberg and others or they're moving to the Cook Islands or New Zealand.
[42:28.000 --> 42:42.000]  They're all evacuating now because they're planning something big in phase two to stop Russia, to stop the United States, to stop Japan who has joined us and to stop the UK who's joined us.
[42:42.000 --> 42:47.000]  In an emergency plan to turn the eugenics world government program around.
[42:47.000 --> 42:48.000]  We don't have long.
[42:48.000 --> 42:54.000]  The next phase was going to be huge wars and bio weapons being released that are going to start killing hundreds of millions.
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.000]  They'll use that crisis to put in a bigger police state and then billions.
[42:58.000 --> 43:05.000]  They were getting ready to go truly operational into 2025 towards total worldwide collapse.
[43:05.000 --> 43:16.000]  I told you if we put out emergency warnings and expose this that people inside the technocracy would be forced to move because they were compartmentalized but already knew how bad this was.
[43:16.000 --> 43:20.000]  But we're waiting for the public to be informed enough so that we can try to reverse this.
[43:20.000 --> 43:21.000]  We've done it.
[43:21.000 --> 43:29.000]  Right now we are in a position because you're seeing the other Briggs and other nationalist movements.
[43:29.000 --> 43:30.000]  They're strong.
[43:30.000 --> 43:40.000]  But notice when America does it, it's with a flame throwing Colossus like Trump who just cuts down the line with it's only the Holy Spirit.
[43:40.000 --> 43:47.000]  I mean that speech he wrote noticed I was tweeting before he's going to declare the birthright bring God back in for real.
[43:47.000 --> 43:54.000]  He's going to declare providence and say God is with us but we have to ask God in and give God the credit.
[43:54.000 --> 44:04.000]  Obama and all of them were just being exercised like demons because they understand they had to break our will get God out to control us.
[44:04.000 --> 44:10.000]  And by getting God out they took over our churches and put little devils in almost all of them.
[44:10.000 --> 44:16.000]  You go into those churches, you feel the energy, it's the most satanic you feel anywhere.
[44:16.000 --> 44:22.000]  All of that's going to be broken if we decide to break it.
[44:22.000 --> 44:26.000]  This is an incredible time ladies and gentlemen.
[44:26.000 --> 44:31.000]  It is unspeakably good.
[44:31.000 --> 44:34.000]  Now a nuke could go off tomorrow.
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  People say oh they didn't go off during the inauguration. I didn't say it would.
[44:36.000 --> 44:40.000]  I said they're really hyping terror attacks and a bunch of Democrats aren't going to be there and they're calling for the death of Trump.
[44:40.000 --> 44:53.000]  And he needs to check the White House for explosives because I would be surprised if they don't blow the damn thing up and have a thousand pounds of C4 in his office when he goes in there and say Al Qaeda did it.
[44:53.000 --> 45:00.000]  You notice he's not staying in there for months and you notice that Madonna's calling for the White House to be blown up.
[45:00.000 --> 45:02.000]  Their intention is very clear.
[45:02.000 --> 45:15.000]  But if you people think you're going to kill Trump and then kill this worldwide movement, if Trump's killed, God is going to send somebody right out of the blue five times more powerful.
[45:15.000 --> 45:21.000]  That's how this works.
[45:21.000 --> 45:31.000]  Anyone who's listened for 20 years knows I've always talked about the fact that I was on air knowing in my spirit that I had to warn everybody for the public and the world and not just for this country but worldwide.
[45:31.000 --> 45:42.000]  National sovereignty, the renaissance, reawakening to truly godly values and most importantly that I knew there were leaders out there and you hurt me beg every week.
[45:42.000 --> 45:54.000]  Where are the leaders? Where are the billionaires? Where are the strong men that I know are smarter than I am who don't have spirits of evil? Where are you to oppose this eugenics program?
[45:54.000 --> 45:57.000]  And now you're about to see it.
[45:57.000 --> 46:04.000]  I've got tons of news I need to hit but here's that clip from near the end of the speech where he, this is a prelude, a hint.
[46:04.000 --> 46:13.000]  Come out the sun coming up from behind the mountains and it's really dark, the first light comes over, you see it in some high clouds, it's golden.
[46:13.000 --> 46:23.000]  It might be 30 minutes till you actually see the sun come up but you get that first line of light and you're seeing it and the enemy sees it.
[46:23.000 --> 46:33.000]  Like a fiery standard in the sky, a message and they are just beside themselves.
[46:33.000 --> 46:42.000]  Because America has hit bottom and is coming back up and so are so many other places in the world and as that spirit accelerates, as the optimism intensifies,
[46:42.000 --> 46:49.000]  as we reject the evil Hollywood culture and all the rest of the garbage, it is going to be incredible time.
[46:49.000 --> 47:01.000]  But it's because the enemy is going to reorganize with AI and other systems and global crises that are going to come and humanity needs a time to strengthen itself before the final phase
[47:01.000 --> 47:06.000]  that will choose the destiny for humanity forever.
[47:06.000 --> 47:14.000]  This is the prelude in the next 15, 20 years for the entire future, this is it.
[47:14.000 --> 47:17.000]  Trump's not perfect, nobody is but it's a preparation.
[47:17.000 --> 47:24.000]  You know, Ron Paul has an article that's up on infowars.com, I'm going to talk about in the next segment.
[47:24.000 --> 47:32.000]  He says, Trump's foreign policy and unwise inconsistency, question mark, Trump cannot be for war and against war simultaneously.
[47:32.000 --> 47:39.000]  Well, Ron Paul, Congressman Paul, former Congressman's on this Wednesday will discuss this.
[47:39.000 --> 47:46.000]  People misinterpret the Bible, I mean it's admittedly misinterpreted, where they say,
[47:46.000 --> 47:58.000]  thou shalt not kill, it's really thou shalt not murder, because in the very same book in the Bible it says, rise up and defend your family and kill those that come to hurt you during the night at your home.
[47:58.000 --> 48:01.000]  I mean, that's undebatable.
[48:01.000 --> 48:07.000]  But they take it and they twist it and they just like to do Romans 13 and they say, thou shalt not kill.
[48:07.000 --> 48:11.000]  Really, I mean, don't even kill a cow, don't even kill a sheep we're about to eat.
[48:11.000 --> 48:17.000]  And then the whole Old Testament's about defending yourself and killing those that come to attack you and defending your family.
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  Well, it's the same thing here.
[48:19.000 --> 48:32.000]  If Al Qaeda and ISIS are attacking innocent nations, killing people, spilling out murdering, we're going to defeat the problem that the globalist helped create to stop it, to liberate.
[48:32.000 --> 48:38.000]  Trump didn't start those wars, he's trying to end them before they spill all over the world, which was the globalist plan.
[48:38.000 --> 48:41.000]  So it's not inconsistent.
[48:41.000 --> 48:45.000]  It's stopping war, it's stopping death.
[48:45.000 --> 48:49.000]  And everybody who studied any history knows, or the Bible, there is a righteous war.
[48:49.000 --> 48:53.000]  It's a war of defense.
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  And so I understand he's saying, well, this is inconsistent.
[48:55.000 --> 48:56.000]  No, it's not.
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  Let's not start a war with Russia.
[48:58.000 --> 48:59.000]  China's threatening us.
[48:59.000 --> 49:00.000]  Let's beef up for that.
[49:00.000 --> 49:03.000]  Let's not turn radical jihadis, lose every word of murder people.
[49:03.000 --> 49:08.000]  Let's go roll them up and kick them back to their countries they were in and try to liberate those countries.
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  If the people vote for that, we'll support them.
[49:10.000 --> 49:20.000]  Instead of having an Arab Spring to put every radical jihadist, Saudi Arabian funded group in, he's blocking the entire New World Order program.
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  He's not an isolationist, ladies and gentlemen.
[49:22.000 --> 49:32.000]  He's about to resurrect America and spill it out free market and culturally worldwide, 1776 worldwide.
[49:32.000 --> 49:35.000]  I'm going to skip this break too.
[49:35.000 --> 49:38.000]  Let's go ahead and go to the club.
[49:38.000 --> 49:55.000]  We stand at the birth of a little millennium ready to unlock the mysteries of space to free the earth from the miseries of disease and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.
[49:55.000 --> 50:03.000]  A new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights and heal our divisions.
[50:03.000 --> 50:19.000]  It's time to remember that all wisdom our soldiers will never forget that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.
[50:19.000 --> 50:28.000]  Have you heard that before?
[50:28.000 --> 50:29.000]  This is it.
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  Everybody says they want freedom.
[50:31.000 --> 50:34.000]  Everybody says they want to be able to come together, have a shot at the future.
[50:34.000 --> 50:35.000]  This is it.
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  It doesn't mean Trump's going to implement anything perfectly.
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  He's got all these underlings, all this bureaucracy.
[50:39.000 --> 50:43.000]  Our country is super corrupt.
[50:43.000 --> 50:49.000]  There are so many lazy dishonorable people that have been produced by this system, we've got to cut them off.
[50:49.000 --> 50:52.000]  Just like spoiled kids, they've got to be cut off.
[50:52.000 --> 50:56.000]  There's got to be some tough punishments here and tough measures.
[50:56.000 --> 51:05.000]  And you know, people like Madonna shoot their mouth off and say go kill the president to a crowd of a couple hundred thousand people, half a million people, maybe a million people.
[51:05.000 --> 51:08.000]  One way or another, she's going to get repercussions for that.
[51:08.000 --> 51:13.000]  People say, oh, don't threaten Madonna. Hey, she's the one making the threats here.
[51:13.000 --> 51:22.000]  Who wants to kill an elected leader? Madonna? Madonna needs to pay.
[51:22.000 --> 51:30.000]  The leaders of this evil go around trying to organize death and destruction and openly announce war.
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  That's a violent action.
[51:32.000 --> 51:39.000]  If you kill a crowd of upwards of a million people, I want to blow up the wine house. Somebody ought to do it.
[51:39.000 --> 51:42.000]  A lot of weak-minded people take that as the reason to do it.
[51:42.000 --> 51:49.000]  And then somebody goes and hijacks a gas truck and loads it with explosives and gets it in and blows up part of the wine house.
[51:49.000 --> 51:52.000]  They'll hail Madonna as a hero in MSM.
[51:52.000 --> 51:55.000]  MSM isn't just controlled, leftist media.
[51:55.000 --> 52:03.000]  It's the worst elements of the corrupt hijacked intelligence agencies who have a religion of making you poor and dominating you.
[52:03.000 --> 52:08.000]  America is the big prize in their world government takeover.
[52:08.000 --> 52:14.000]  Notice the stronger a people are, the meaner the globalist are to them in different countries and regions of the world.
[52:14.000 --> 52:18.000]  And they hate us the most. They hate the Russians wildly.
[52:18.000 --> 52:23.000]  They hate the Japanese. They hate people in Africa. They hate everybody.
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  They hate Europe.
[52:25.000 --> 52:29.000]  They want us poor and under their control. This is the key to everything.
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  They want us sick.
[52:31.000 --> 52:37.000]  And you go look at their servants. It's judge a tree by its fruits. You go look at their minions. You go look at their slaves.
[52:37.000 --> 52:50.000]  You go to that million woman march and it was just the vicious, ugly, hateful, twisted, stupid, scraggly,
[52:50.000 --> 52:53.000]  just shuffling, obese. And I'm not trying to be mean.
[52:53.000 --> 52:58.000]  I've been overweight. The point is, it's part of the plagues of the corruption.
[52:58.000 --> 53:03.000]  And then the few people that didn't look like they were half dead were young high school girls who would say,
[53:03.000 --> 53:08.000]  oh, it's Trump's funded by Saudi Arabia, not her. No, I love Hillary.
[53:08.000 --> 53:11.000]  Just their delusion is God.
[53:11.000 --> 53:16.000]  And then she gets attacked physically.
[53:16.000 --> 53:25.000]  A man literally, well, it's all in there, runs up to her own shroyer separately and they start humping you.
[53:25.000 --> 53:28.000]  They start pushing you with their weight and humping you.
[53:28.000 --> 53:31.000]  Or they throw urine or feces on you or batteries.
[53:31.000 --> 53:34.000]  And they scream with the ugliest faces I've ever seen.
[53:34.000 --> 53:37.000]  I mean, they contort them into ugly faces.
[53:37.000 --> 53:41.000]  Yeah. I hate you.
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  I mean, I'm not going to do it because it hurts my voice.
[53:43.000 --> 53:52.000]  And I can make the faces. I mean, it's very demonic.
[53:52.000 --> 53:56.000]  So they have tied their minds into a very wicked place.
[53:56.000 --> 54:02.000]  They are dialed into the ether to a very, very wicked low area.
[54:02.000 --> 54:06.000]  This is the guy that goes around humping.
[54:06.000 --> 54:08.000]  He's humping the street preacher. Here, back this up.
[54:08.000 --> 54:12.000]  There's so much cussing, though. I mean, there's like F-bombs every three seconds.
[54:12.000 --> 54:15.000]  And there's a street preacher and they go to conservative events, liberal events.
[54:15.000 --> 54:18.000]  They go to football games. They go to everything. They're all over the country. I forget the group.
[54:18.000 --> 54:21.000]  And they're good street preachers. They really lay it out and it's good to listen to.
[54:21.000 --> 54:22.000]  That's their first amendment.
[54:22.000 --> 54:26.000]  And he starts pushing him and pushing him harder and harder and he almost falls over.
[54:26.000 --> 54:32.000]  And this is one of the biggest ones. This guy would be like a top 100 percentile for the trendies.
[54:32.000 --> 54:35.000]  I mean, he's like very alpha male and he's humping this guy.
[54:35.000 --> 54:42.000]  And he goes, look, he's humping and they start shoving him and then he starts shoving and humping on Millie.
[54:42.000 --> 54:49.000]  And then Owen had people shoving and humping him so because they're all trained and they all go to these events, these seminars.
[54:49.000 --> 54:56.000]  And they found it. Fricks people out. Give their pelvically up to your buttocks, thrusting their penis into you.
[54:56.000 --> 54:59.000]  This is what they do. I had them doing it to me and I'd be like, what are you doing?
[54:59.000 --> 55:04.000]  And they're just humping on the side of you. I just shove them off of me. I mean, I'm done.
[55:04.000 --> 55:13.000]  So if you're a radio listener at infowars.com forward slash show cruising a great job.
[55:13.000 --> 55:20.000]  But I bring this up on how you're finding it in just seconds because there's like 30 hours of video on infowars.com and our Facebook and YouTube.
[55:20.000 --> 55:22.000]  We've got to have people go through it and put it up.
[55:22.000 --> 55:25.000]  By the way, let me just stop for a moment.
[55:25.000 --> 55:28.000]  I've skipped two breaks today. I've done all this. I'm not doing that anymore today.
[55:28.000 --> 55:32.000]  This is how we fund our operation. This is how we have reporters all over the country.
[55:32.000 --> 55:40.000]  I want to set up White House correspondents because I've got to have a camera crew, video personnel, social network folks and at least one or two reporters.
[55:40.000 --> 55:49.000]  I intend, but I actually have to plan it and I just do it half-baked to set up a Washington bureau because now there's real change happening as we retake the nation's capital.
[55:49.000 --> 55:51.000]  It takes money. I need the money.
[55:51.000 --> 55:54.000]  Paul wants to set up a London bureau.
[55:54.000 --> 56:05.000]  Just a few people, but he'll get the job done and we talked about today also rotate in about six months out of the year into the DC bureau.
[56:05.000 --> 56:11.000]  I talked to some of the Trump people. They thought Paul would be ideal at the White House.
[56:11.000 --> 56:16.000]  He's a humble guy. I have to make him go on air and he's like a superstar because he doesn't want to go on the air.
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.000]  When he does it, he's so good.
[56:18.000 --> 56:25.000]  Guys with me, 16 years, made him start going on air five years ago, told him I'm cutting your pay in half if you don't start doing it.
[56:25.000 --> 56:29.000]  Just amazing.
[56:29.000 --> 56:38.000]  But we got a lot of plans. We're going to fight hard now more than ever, ladies and gentlemen, and we need the money and we've got nutraceutical supplements that everyone's got to have.
[56:38.000 --> 56:43.000]  And I told them to end the special this Sunday. They're doing it one more day and then it's over.

[57:33.000 --> 57:41.000]  He's the official guy for the GOP limited edition printed just for info wars of Donald J. Trump.
[57:41.000 --> 57:47.000]  I need to do a video actually show people the parchment paper and how amazing that's just a scan of it and that doesn't give it justice.
[57:47.000 --> 57:58.000]  It's unbelievable 1995 I mean I could sell these in an art gallery probably for $1000 a piece framed. That's another thing I wanted to offer a frame version of these but I guess we didn't whatever.
[57:58.000 --> 58:04.000]  The point is that 1995 limited edition that five star reviews.

[59:28.000 --> 59:35.000]  Dependent upon selenium so it really is a all around nutrient that everybody really needs.

[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  You know there's a clip up on info wars dot com an article Juliani says why doesn't the press just admit they despise the president.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  Admit it they most of them say they want to kill him they get away with saying killing that they're organizing it that they said they want me dead.
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  I had a guy in Austin show me a gun.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  As I was leaving a restaurant coming up and showing me and you know f Trump.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  Another car drives by f you Alex shows it's just like they feel entitled they really believe their crap because they're losers and all they've got is hatred.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  It's crazy.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  And now David Brock the guy that obsesses on me almost as much as he does Trump I'm very honored by that.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  He's up on info wars dot com now coming out and saying they're going to begin the impeachment with a new system they're launching the Trump war room to target the administration or want launching our own war room.
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  I've got the exact same term and we're launching a DC America Defense Center basically.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  This isn't journalism.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  This isn't a journalistic endeavors and do research and just tell the truth.
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  This is open war with insurrectionist enemies.
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  Foreign and domestic in the news begging communist China at Davos oh please help us get rid of Trump.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  We want world government.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  I mean that's called treason.
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  Then you accuse us of being with Russia.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  Russia overpowered the election. They're so powerful. They're so amazing. And then on Friday for the inauguration they claimed Roger Stone and Manafort that the CIA might have communications with them and the Russians.
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  There are none.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  There is none.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  It got to the point like a few time I had Russian women walk up to me and try to say hi and I wouldn't even take pictures with them.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  I'm sorry. How do I know that's not one of their operatives and then they say oh look he's with a Russian spy or something.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  I mean it is just getting crazier and crazier and crazier.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  And the articles are just pouring in DC police war.
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  Pussy hats that's what it's called in support of Soros linked protests. They don't even change the name from pussy riot. It's the same thing pink your women the men are against you and the DC police who were appointed by Obama their police chief would not defend women.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  I saw it being bloody so I went over there and tried to do something and the police drug me out.
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  Then they had a bunch of news articles put out showing images of me being taken out of the communist group that attacked me for my protection in Cleveland and multiple newspapers including TV MSNBC ran the image of where I'm being escorted out
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  months ago in July last year and then added I was drunk and the police were escorting me up.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  I mean they've gone to levels of I mean lines one thing and bad if you lie about some fact in a story that that's classical line.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  This is like whole cloth. No no no I wasn't just drunk when I did this at you know 11 o'clock in the morning or whatever.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  And then they combine it with some nighttime thing. I actually came down off a beanstalk.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  There in DC that's how I got there from Austin. There was a beanstalk from Austin all the way over to there and I came down off a magic beanstalk.
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  I mean that's how I mean I mean I read these articles now and they don't even make sense. It's like a crazy person wrote it.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  By the way I meant to tell you have you guys seen the footage of the most deranged anti-Trump protester yet the person the clown outfit flopping around the ground with 10 cans.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  I want to show that we come back because we take something this wasn't just a one case scenario.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  There were people running around completely mentally ill everywhere.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  In fact can we come in with the intro where we have you know the woman when she hears he's the 45th president going no.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  It goes on for a long time. I mean they truly are deranged. They have been absolutely brainwashed.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  Look what they've done to them. This isn't even funny.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  So your douchebag sense of entitlement is so palpable that it makes you the ugliest person in the room.
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  And if you don't come off your self-made soapbox now you will soon be the most lonely desperate desolate people on earth.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  Donald Trump is your president. The reality is Donald Trump is the president. America elected him.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  And we're here to make America great again. Make planet earth great again.

[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  and is a key blueprint worldwide in nation states launching a new renaissance.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  I've been told that by the President.
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  I've been told that by Nigel Farage on and off air.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  I have been told that by the top generals, you name it.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  And it's because we, the people, this audience of, hell, we even had 5, 6, 7 million listeners 16, 17, 18 years ago.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  The show's been big for a long time.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  I was on the air one year and I had the top show on Saturday night and then I was given a week night show.
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  And I'm not bragging about that.
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  This is historical.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  You need to understand we've now gone to over 40 million a week that listen or watch.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  That's not counting our articles and all the rest of it.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  And that's on our platforms.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  But we have access to all these Google analytics systems that can show us the reach.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  We have access to Facebook analytics.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  I'm going to start showing people a lot of this.
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  I've got to get authorization because we have high level access to this because how big we are.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  And there's a lot of provisos in it.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  You're not supposed to publish a lot of it because it's, I mean, it's the tales, basically NSA technology.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  But our reach is now quarterly 2.3 billion people on Facebook alone.
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  That's why they're trying to kick us off of it.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  I mean, it's just insane.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  And reach means it's in front of people.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  We don't know if they saw it or watched it.
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  But what I'm telling you is you deserve the victory, our crew.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  Every one of my reporters, the people behind the scenes from the janitor to the folks getting the video clips, everybody and our guest.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  But I got to tell you, just historically, not about credit, but we have to know what worked and it was the truth.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  It was taking action.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  Trump is now delivering just he tripled down his speech on nationalism, the new Renaissance bringing God back in.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  Started bombing ISIS within one hour of being president.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  As soon as Mathis was confirmed, one hour after he was president, by one o'clock in the afternoon, they were hitting all the ISIS targets, rolling them up with the Russians.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  Within one hour, US Air Force was green lighted.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  They've been blocked.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  No more will they have planes dropping leaflets an hour before and just let the trucks of stolen oil go into Turkey.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  It's all over.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  Signed the repeal of Obamacare two hours after that, the beginning of the repeal.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  Getting rid of the forced mandate and just delivering, delivering.
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  I can't even keep track of it now.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  I'm going to Roger Stone.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  I can't even keep track of Foxconn is going to have non-slave factories now in the US.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  They're moving here.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  Chrysler, Ford's announcing more.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  Toyota's suddenly announcing more.
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  All of it.
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  I'm just going to tell you because I'm not just privy to it.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  I've done the research. There's a real world alliance that our top generals and others have said is really for America in the world.
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  That's the US with the UK with the Russians and with Japan and with any Latin Americans, Africans or Middle Eastern countries that want to be, you know, a pro freedom.
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  Cleaning out the euro, breaking that up, restoring freedom, restoring the borders and then just having a total free for all with all these advanced technologies that DARPA and others have been ordered to suppress because they call them disruptive being deployed to America.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  And then in deals for licensing for the rest of the world.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  And they're saying Trump's about to handicap American supremacy.
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  America is about to absolutely take over the whole planet, but not a bunch of corporate chiefs.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  The idea and wealth.
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  It's incredible.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  If Trump can deliver the plan, it's not his plan.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  It's not my plan.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  It's God's plan.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  It's over.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  Humanity goes to the next level.
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  Like none of it.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  We can be given the reprieve, folks.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  This is like a novel that has multiple endings.
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  We decide God gives us free will.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  Roger Stone cutting the bureaucracy 75% that they admit is not to keep the earth clean.
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  It's meant to hurt our our industry and shut us down.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  He's just delivering on every front.
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  He said it.
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  He's not.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  He got his hair cut.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  He's not wearing makeup looks even better today.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  I mean, it just gets better and better and better.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  I've gone from my gut saying go with Trump two years ago when we first started meeting to now just going man.
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  It's almost scary.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  All I got to do is follow my gut.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  He said we're just going to win and win and win.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  I'm going to get sick of winning and it's all it is crazy.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  And then I saw that the hate of the Soros funded people worshiping Islamist being run by Muslims.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  That was a Muslim march with women asking to wear hijabs and be slaves.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  They're like insane.
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  This is like 10 times a Twilight Zone episode.
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  It's so bizarre.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  Roger, your book is now on pre-sale about to be shipping at infowarstore.com.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  We're going to talk about that some, but I'm going to skip this break too.
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  It's historic.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  But but I just I'm beside myself.
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  It's how good we are and how bad they are.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  I've never been like that.
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  And I'm not saying that in an elitist way.
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  I felt bad for how ignorant and hateful and having hundreds of women screen you're an effing white male spitting in my face being totally racist against white people.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  They were white themselves, not seeing the irony of how Martin Luther King said the opposite.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  I mean, I just don't understand how good this could all be when you're informed versus these people.
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  I mean, my optimism has never been anywhere near this.
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  But I also fear when Madonna is openly allowed to say we develop the White House.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  Let's do it to probably a million women.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  I mean, and then saying that he took the bust of Martin Luther King out knowing they've got low information listeners who only listen to them.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  They still think he took it out now.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  It doesn't.
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  So it's seeing them triple down on the lies.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  I don't even know what to say at this point, Rogers.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  Well, Alex, first of all, a very big victory only moments ago for President Trump and his new administration.
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  When my friend Senator Marco Rubio announced that he would vote to confirm Rex Tillerson as the Secretary of State.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  Now, Senator Rubio had an opportunity to express his concerns about the appointment, but he has wisely decided to give the president his own team to try to remake our foreign policy.
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  So this is a key vote because with Rubio and the undermining by Senator John McCain and his many me from South Carolina, we probably would have been short of the 50 votes.
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  Meaning that the Trump administration would have to deal with the Democrats to ensure the confirmation of Rex Tillerson.
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  I think Tillerson is brilliant outside the box choice.
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  He's a practical businessman who like Donald Trump wants to get something done.
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  He's a tough negotiator.
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:24.000]  We need some tough negotiations with Vladimir Putin and the Russians so that we might have peace.
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  Peace is the objective.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  It says it about how you get along with Putin.
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  It's about peace and what you're seeing, both in the demonstrations, Alex, and in the constant campaign to undermine Trump is that the deep state just cannot accept his election.
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  They won't stop trying to undermine him.
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  And how does that not certify him with the so-called left that claims their anti-establishment when the entire establishment is in its death rows throwing everything they've got at Trump?
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  Now, there is some dichotomy in my view between the violent demonstrations that took place during the inauguration and some aspects of the women's march.
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  My own granddaughter caught a coke bottle in the ankle when there was a rain of bottles and rocks and eggs when we were attempting to enter the deployable, the deployable.
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  I myself saw protesters smashing the ATM machine, smashing the windows of banks.
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  I was apprised of the situation.
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  They attacked Larry King.
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  They attacked Larry King.
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:52.000]  My own 27-year-old granddaughter decked a protester, literally knocked him cold when he pushed her off the sidewalk into some dirt and called her a Nazi bitch.
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:18:00.000]  So, you know, the question one has to ask is what was the DC metropolitan police doing?
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  I understand people have a right to free speech.
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  But let me tell you, they wore the George Soros, quote, pussy hats. I'm sorry, folks, that's the name of it, the pink hat Soros funded it.
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  They wore the hats the police admitted to us.
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  They were ordered to stand down because Obama was the commander-in-chief until Trump was sworn in.
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  So the police loved it.
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  Well, the police clearly were ordered to stand down.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  My point, of course, is that people are entitled to amass and protest.
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:33.000]  300 people outside the deplorable, cheering, jeering, holding sides.
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  Sure, but not throwing batteries in urine.
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  We didn't block the Soros march of the women.
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  Exactly. In other words, we were people throwing rocks, people throwing bottles, people throwing baggies full of urine, people throwing baggies full of Clorox, people throwing eggs, a shower of eggs.
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:54.000]  By the way, Clorox is an attempt to blind you. That hits you in the eyes.
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  I mean, let me say something. You throw Clorox at me, I'm going to bash your brains out.
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:00.000]  That was an assault with a deadly weapon.
[1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  Well, women in my party were spat upon on their attempt to get to the inaugural ball.
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:08.000]  They were a brain of spit from these scumbags.
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  Now, the women's march, in all honesty, I think there were many, many, many, many women there.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  And they were a bunch of them staying in my hotel. They were very nice people.
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  They have legitimate concerns. I think they're going to be happy in the sense that I don't think Trump is motivated by social issues.
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  I think that he is highly sensitive to the women's health issues because of Ivanka's activities in that area.
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  So I think there are a lot of sincere people there.
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  They, Alex, were infected by the Soros types with their violent and nasty anti-Trump signs and their professional agitators to give the entire march a more radical bend.
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:58.000]  There were some good people there. There are some people there who don't hate Donald Trump, but they just have concerns about his views.
[1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:04.000]  And then there's other hardcore, you know, Soros, Stooges, who are looking for an incident.
[1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:11.000]  Looking for this not becoming a symbolic march over issues, but spilling over into violence.
[1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:15.000]  And no, I don't care what they say. I'm not wearing one of those little pink hats.
[1:20:15.000 --> 1:20:24.000]  Well, notice it's all part of Soros' color revolutions. They didn't even change the name of the revolution they funded for eight years in Russia with pink hats,
[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  purplish pink hats, calling it the pussy revolution. It's the same thing.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  That's exactly right. And look, David Brock, the thug who works for Soros, the man who, even the WikiLeaks, highest age to Clinton said was back shit crazy.
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:49.000]  That's a quote. He is now out soliciting money for a new $40 million budget to smear Donald Trump.
[1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  Now, this is ironic. This is a guy who evaded a million plus in taxes.
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  Let me stop you right there. Let me stop you right there. They have the IRS persecute everybody for no reason for years.
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:06.000]  MSNBC said, oh, we're auditing and harassing and harassing the Tea Party because they deserve it. They're all racist.
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  I'm not calling for Trump to persecute people. I'm not calling for it. But if they're breaking the law, the attorney general, the IRS, you name it,
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  and Brock and Al Sharpton, you know, owes $5 million in taxes, if I did, I'd be under the jail.
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  I'm tired of them being above the law. We get harassed. You've just been audited and harassed. You're following the law. They're not. I'm sick of it.
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  Well, it's very clear to me that you have a situation in which Soros is inciting people to violence, and he's paying them to do that.
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  That is a federal crime. If he incites people to make threats against the president, that is a federal crime.
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  It seems to me that Mr. Soros is entirely indictable in this country if the Hungarians don't do it first, frankly, because he is fomenting problems and revolution by violent overthrow around the globe.
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  The real irony, of course, is that Brock and Soros, or I should say Brock and Soros' money, probably spend $300 million in this constant harangue of covering up the Clinton's deepest crimes while attacking Alex Jones and Roger Stone endlessly.
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  Why anyone would give this loser $40 million more so that he can fail?
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  Well, that's my next point. Let me go over some of these articles. DC police wore pussy hats in support of Soros' linked protests, and most of them weren't like that, but I went to them.
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  They said, I'm sorry. We've been ordered not to help you. Women bleeding. People trying to go to work. They said, I'm sorry. We've been ordered not to do anything.
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  So I went and made a big scene until they were forced to do something, at least one of the entrances. Meanwhile, German, Feminazi, Shantala, Akbar, and Islamists backed women's march. I mean, this is crazy. In Germany, and it was here, we have footage. I couldn't believe it.
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:23:05.000]  They were chanting that they want Sharia law and that I'm a white male fascist. So because most of the Islamist male controllers are brown, they think going under Islam is good.
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  This is the craziest Stockholm syndrome, cuckold, weird ass stuff. I mean, I couldn't believe it, Roger. In fact, saying it, I mean, he went on for hours. It was like all these signs, Allah Akbar and the women coming up.
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  I mean, this is the craziest crap. Like the West created freedom for women, spoils women, puts them on a pedestal, and they're bitching at us saying, I want to be under fricking beehive hats and be murdered if my husband wants to.
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  What the hell? I've got stacks of articles admitting it. Sweden immigrants arrested after gang raping woman on Facebook live and you look at these animals.
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  I just, I just, don't these feminists, I have Gloria Steinem admitting she worked for the CIA to break up the family on film now. I didn't know this existed.
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:24:04.000]  It's been 60 minutes early. I'm sorry. I'm ranting while you're talking. I'm going to be showing TV viewers some of these articles. But I mean, the merger of the left with Islam, they really believe it's going to be the muscle that takes over for them.
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  This is craziness.
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  Alex, I concur with your views. At the same time, I think the president is undeterred. He is going to stick to his agenda. And I don't think he's going to be affected one way or another by by these marches, or by the shrill attacks of these Soros, you know, bots that are that are so entirely obvious in my opinion.
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  I'm more concerned, frankly, with the story in the New York Times that was purposely timed for inauguration day that claimed that myself, Paul Manafort, the former chairman of the Trump campaign, and somebody named Carter Page, who was allegedly a advisor to Trump on Russian issues,
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  that was under investigation by the intelligence agencies, and that they had intercepted email communications and financial tract transactions between the Trump forces and the Russian.
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  Now, they said they might. They let them rise though.
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  Now, I can assure you, as I have previously, that this is bunk. There are no email transmissions between me and anyone involved with the Russians or the Russians themselves. I have no Russian clients.
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  I have not been in communications with any Russians or anybody representing Russians.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  And they know better than that. In the 80s, they tried to recruit a recruit union. You did a sting on them and sent them to jail.
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  But it is the same thing here, which is the left cannot drop this main. Trump goes to the intelligence to write to Langley and gives a speech in which he says he's going to be backing the agency.
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  Well, I'm all for that after cleaning house.
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  And then seeing in goes, and I saw the host, he's there insulting them. Who does he think he is giving a speech there in the Hall of Heroes?
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  He's the freaking president. That's who he is. I want to get more into the Russian thing, but what about claiming that he took the bust out?
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  What about saying, showing photos before the Secret Service fully opened the gates?
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  I mean, what about just the conniption fit of deception after deception after deception?
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  I mean, like you said, they don't seem to understand. They were already rejected. So what happens, Roger?
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  Now, what do you see happening now that they've only gone more insane?
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  Well, Trump must clean house at the Central Intelligence Agency, certainly replacing John Brennan with Richard Pompeo will be the improvement.
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  But he must recognize that the second and third level there and others, there are rogue elements, perhaps controlling elements of that agency, starting with John Brennan.
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  John Brennan predicted the Russian hacking before it happened.
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  John Brennan continues to claim that this Russian hacking happened. It didn't.
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  This is the same John Brennan, who's a longtime member of the U.S. Communist Party, who was the station chief for the, for the agency in red.
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  He was definitely turned, but let's get him as a communist when he was younger.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:12.000]  Look at this. Rince Priebus, ex CIA chief Brennan Bitter, he wasn't retained by president.
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  He's actually shocked that Trump removed him when just a week ago he said, you better watch your mouth, President-elect.
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  Who the hell does this crazy John? He think he is.
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  You're exactly right. But it's not just him.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  I wonder if Brennan is going to be canoeing anytime soon or kayaking.
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  Well, look, I think Jeff Sessions should take a hard look at this guy's entire record.
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  I do not think that he is loyal to the United States. I think he was flipped. I believe he-
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  And they're clearly so mentally ill that they don't think we don't see what they're doing.
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  Let me ask you this. You talk about the stomach fever. I saw the arrogance of these people. Why are they so mentally ill?
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  Well, because they've been running things for 30 years. Everything has been done the neocon way.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  The Bush Clinton-Bush Obama Combine has run the country into the ditch, but they are used to having their way.
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  Now along comes this upstart, this reformer, Donald Trump with his own ideas, and you can't bully him.
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  And you can't buy him. See, the Saudis are very adept at buying people.
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  They buy their way through Washington. All the special interests buy their way through Washington.
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  And Trump just doesn't play that game. So there is a panic. Beyond that, there's a panic over what they see as his narrow-minded agenda.
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  Oh yeah, they claim he's going to hurt the whole world government, but they've been using our money to build the world government.
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  It's what you make of coming in and delivering 75% cut in regulations.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  Well, meanwhile, Trump is working the phones with some of these big companies like LBJ.
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:59.000]  He is weedling and coddling and coaxing and talking and negotiating and pushing and probably threatening people in these big companies to stay in the United States.
[1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  Well, he threatened them on air. He said, you're not bringing your crap back in here if you leave.
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  It's called leadership. It's what we lack, leadership.
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  And by the way, the Heritage Foundation says, oh, it's the end of free market.
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:16.000]  No, we've been ganged up on by everybody else looking out for their interest for 50 years. That's coming to an end. It's only fair.
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  Trump is a free trader. We just don't have free trade. We have free trade and then a bunch of rules put on top of it.
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  That means we really don't get access to their markets. He's going to fix that.
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  Well, the numbers are incredible. You look at China or Japan, they just don't let our cars in.
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:35.000]  And then we just open our market up to theirs to millions a year. It's over.
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  And Japan says they're going to play ball. They understand that they've been stagnant for 20 years.
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:44.000]  It's time to stop this. It's time to turn it around. And Japan does.
[1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:46.000]  Americans need to be able to afford to buy their great cars.
[1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  We'll be back with Roger Stone. History has happened. We'll look at his speech straight ahead.
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:57.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:08.000]  Well, it's no secret that Hillary Clinton is the one that coined the term deplorables and that we stole it, ran with it and now owned it.
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:13.000]  But let's recap some of the behavior we saw over the past election and at the inauguration.
[1:30:13.000 --> 1:30:20.000]  People protesting Trump were assaulting reporters, burning limos, smashing buildings, throwing stink bombs,
[1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:26.000]  disrupting the inauguration and other events that were happening, blocking streets, cursing at reporters.
[1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:32.000]  At the Women's March, you had people on the stage cursing repeatedly, talking about fallatio on air,
[1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:39.000]  saying Trump can fallatio himself, threatening to bomb the White House, wearing pussy hats, spitting on people.
[1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:45.000]  How about all the assassination threats we've seen on Twitter? I'm not seeing any of that from Trump supporters.
[1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:54.000]  So after all, who are the real deplorables? I've said it once and I'll say it again. When they go low, they go really, really low.
[1:30:54.000 --> 1:31:20.000]  This is Owen Schreuer for infowars.com. Real news, fake deplorable.

[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  That's just an ugly looking crowd.
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  I guess they just misery, loves company.
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  We're going back to Roger Stone here in just a moment. His new book, The Making of a President 2016, how Donald Trump orchestrated a revolution by Roger Stone,

[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  Roger, looking at the news here, and again, the arrogance of these people, and you mentioned it, David Brock,
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:19.000]  it begins, David Brock, far left donors, playing Trump impeachment.
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  Brock Super PAC creates Trump War Room to target administration.
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  Well, I'm announcing a DC War Room that I'm going to set up with reporters and people.
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  I'm all in. I'm expanding in the face of this, and I just believe the revenue will come in to do it.
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  And I'm going to the next level to fight these people, seeing what they're doing.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  We don't have Soros funding us. We have the listeners getting the great products in the old-fashioned free market way.
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  But just look at Trump on this front. There have been a lot of people on the so-called left that were against wars that were wrong,
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  and who were against TPP because it was unelected corporate world government.
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  Well, now Trump designed orders to renegotiate NAFTA and pull out of TPP. Reuters, wow, hip hip hooray.
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  But you bring this up to them. I brought up this weekend that, hey, he's going to repeal it. He's doing it right now.
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  They're like, shut up. Effer. Effer. And it's just like, we'll just be rational. No. White girl, white male.
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  I'm like, that's your white male husband that walks behind you like a baby elephant holding your tail.
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  I mean, that was just the shuffling men that just grovel the women.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  Like, that's how you're a good man. As if men and women in relationships act like that to begin with.
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  Old men I know just lavish their wives and girlfriends.
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:33.000]  I know the guys in charge, but she knows the guy comes up the parking lot wants to fight or mug somebody.
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  She's like, get in there. And if somebody's going to have a baby, it's mama does it.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  Men go out and do the hunting and killing. The women run the show back at the hut.
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  But the issue is they're ending all that.
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  U.S. exit from United Nations could become reality with fresh bill. It's all happening.
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:53.000]  But just in, Fox News during the break, we can put it up.
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  Republican senators introduced a bill. See the attack from the public establishment blocking the president from easing Russian sanctions.
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:05.000]  Draconian massive made up based on the lie that Russia invaded Ukraine.
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  Really, I thought it was George Soros bragged they spent 5 billion U.S. taxpayer dollars and a billion of his to overthrow an elected government
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  and start blowing up the infrastructure and mass murdering, forcing the Russians to come in just 10 miles into Ukraine
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  to protect the Russian enclaves and their infrastructure they built supplying gas to Europe.
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  But an invasion of Eastern Europe and a takeover of the gas supplies hurtling us towards World War 3
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  and Obama massing U.S. troops in Poland. That's not an act of aggression.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  No, Russia just sitting there putting up with it is.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  Again, Trump just sees it very mechanically. Russia's not expanding.
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  The crazy globalist are while they flood Europe with jihadis.
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  That's coming doing in because America is just and righteous and strong.
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  Roger Stone.
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  Alex, I think that this is Trump sticking to his agenda.
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  He's going to renegotiate these massive trade deals.
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  The Mexicans and the Canadians already indicated they're ready to enter those talks.
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  This again is a leadership.
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  Total delivery.
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  Well, tying the hands of the president when it comes to sanctions before he's even had negotiations
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  with the Russians as to peace in that region.
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  Look, Hillary Clinton promised the neocons an expansion of the proxy war.
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  They were prepared to do a no fly zone.
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  This is an open invitation for World War 3.
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  And by the way, I want to say something to Ron Paul. I love Ron Paul. He's on Wednesday.
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  He has an article out on him, FullWars.com.
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  Trump's foreign policy and unwise inconsistency.
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  And he's basically saying we can't be for war to take out ISIS and al-Qaeda.
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  That's the globalist proxy war meant to start war with Russia.
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:53.000]  We have to go clean it up or it'll start a war with Russia, congressman.
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  And I understand Paul, again, just sticks to it from an absolute blind point of view
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  in that he does what he says he'll do.
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  No war at any time.
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  Or if it's cleaning up the neocons and the Democrats trying to start World War 3.
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  Sorry, go ahead.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  Well, unfortunately, ISIS was formed and it's a bipartisan mistake.
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  We let ISIS rise because of the vacuum created by George W. Bush.
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  Hillary and Obama encouraged ISIS and Hillary armed ISIS.
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  And they're now a fact of life.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  A better stewardship of our foreign policy in the region.
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  There had been no ISIS.
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  But that does not mean that you want to rush off to war with Russia over Syria.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  Assad, who runs the country now, is a bad guy, props up Hezbollah,
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  propped up by the Russians.
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  On the other side, you have ISIS propped up by the Saudis.
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  This is not worth a drop of American blood or any borrowed millions for bombing.
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  So this is what the deep state is upset about.
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:03.000]  Even Greenwald brilliantly had this, I think, exactly right last week.
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  He's not a left-wing, he's not a right-winger.
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:07.000]  He's certainly not a Trump fan.
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  But they are deeply disappointed that they're not going to call the shots.
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  Yeah, Greenwald is a leftist, but he's a real old-fashioned one.
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:19.000]  He has integrity showing Trump's right on all these fronts.
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  He has to admit it.
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  Just like to his credit, Bernie Sanders is having to come out and say,
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  OK, Trump's actually doing a lot of good stuff, even from his agenda perspective.
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  And Trump said, this isn't liberal or conservative agenda.
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  This isn't Americana.
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  This isn't about parties.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  This is about prosperity and common sense.
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  He's turning out even better.
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  I mean, he's getting even stronger now that he's in power.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  Yeah, I do still think he has to be very careful of the quiz legs.
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  I mean, nobody opposed his election more than Google.
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:53.000]  They were mega, mega donors to Hillary.
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  They had a revolving door going with the Obama administration, in which they were getting regulatory fixes that were good for Google,
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  but weren't good for consumers, wouldn't work good for a free and open net.
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:11.000]  They were manipulating their data online and their searches to hate Hillary.
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  And now, suddenly, they're trying to cozy up the Donald Trump.
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  Now, suddenly, they're trying to insert some of their people into the White House
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:21.000]  to have sway over international policy.
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  So they have to be watched like a hawk.
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  They're typical of the establishment types who called this election wrong, invested heavily in Hillary,
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  and now have to pass their special interest agenda.
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  Sure, well, I already know that Trump's like Superman.
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  But I guess he's got the right advisors in there.
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  I just don't know how he can negotiate each deal properly when it's so confusing,
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  even though I've researched it deeply with all these big telecoms.
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  He isn't taking money from Google to give them what they want.
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  So he should really just get a panel of experts together and decide what keeps the web free and open
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  and tell Google and Facebook and everybody, listen, you've already had a bunch of monopolistic practices.
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  Okay, you keep doing that and not promoting Americana.
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  We're going to break your back.
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  We're going to break your arms.
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  I mean, if they'll back off and just promote Americana and freedom,
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:13.000]  they can have their big powerful organizations.
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  But if they serve an agenda against America, they need to have their necks broken.
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  Well, I'm Donald Trump has obviously control of the AT&T Time Warner merger.
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  He expressed concerns about this during the campaign.
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  Time Warner, of course, owns CNN.
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  CNN is the epitome, the ground zero in the fake news drive.
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:39.000]  And let me ask you this.
[1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  Why are they foaming at the mouth now even five times worse than two months ago?
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:47.000]  Like I said, quadrupling down again and again.
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  I mean, I guess their bosses have just said, destroy Trump.
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  It looks like the establishment is still intending to remove him.
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:58.000]  I mean, let me tell you, Madonna didn't get up there and say blow up the White House in front of hundreds of thousands of women because she just thought it up.
[1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:03.000]  I mean, it looks like this is what I want to strategize the last few minutes with you as clearly we're winning.
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:06.000]  Trump is amazing worldwide, sovereignty exploding.
[1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  He's not going to be perfect.
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:08.000]  He's going to make mistakes.
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  But overall that he's overperforming what I expected right now.
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:12.000]  He is not disappointing me.
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:14.000]  He's promised everybody this and he's not.
[1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:15.000]  He's delivering.
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:21.000]  But they are acting with body language like they are on a crazed counter offensive.
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:22.000]  What are you concerned about?
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  What do you think is going to happen?
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  Well, first of all, in all candor Alex, I think celebrities like Madonna, like Ashley Judd, they're simply trying to recharge their fading celebrity by making outrageous statements and threats against the president.
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:42.000]  In the case of Madonna threatening to blow up the White House.
[1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:46.000]  I think Madonna should have her fat ass locked up because that wasn't free speech.
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:50.000]  That's a call to overthrow our country and plung us into civil war and probably nuclear war.
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  It is an inappropriate call for violence.
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  We both know she's not going to be prosecuted.
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:43:59.000]  She had probably the records tales aren't going that well.
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:06.000]  She's looking a little long in the tooth and she's trying to prop up her brand in a politically correct way.
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:11.000]  Ashley Judd claims that Trump has wet dreams over his own daughter.
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:13.000]  Kyle, nasty stuff.
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:15.000]  Oh, let me add this.
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:21.000]  SNL says that Barron is going to be the first homeschool shooter.
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:23.000]  I mean, just absolutely amazing.
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  Another one Comedy Central says that Barron's a date rapist.
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:30.000]  I mean, these people are scum.
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:34.000]  Can you imagine if this was said about the first ladies kids when it was Obama?
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:37.000]  Well, first of all, Barron is a minor.
[1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:39.000]  So he's off limits.
[1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  Criticizing the massive theft of say Chelsea Clinton at the Clinton Foundation.
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:45.000]  She's a 35 year old adult.
[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  Exactly.
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:47.000]  Where are the basic rules?
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  People think shelleries wimpy.
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:50.000]  No, you don't want your family targeted.
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:53.000]  I leave people's families alone until they get political on their adults.
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  But but this is unbelievable going after little kids.
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  I mean, I'm getting tired of it.
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  Yeah, but it is part of the elitist derision.
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  They are never going to accept Trump or the results of this election.
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  There's a lot of bitterness there.
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:13.000]  But instead of engaging them, they're best to be ignored.
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:18.000]  Frankly, you and I can engage them, but the president should stay focused on his agenda.
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:19.000]  Sure.
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:21.000]  But it does show what trash they are.
[1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  Well, but it doesn't matter how many people call him a racist.
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  If he revives our inner cities and proves he's not.
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  If he gets affordable housing for poor people, which is one of the biggest problems in this country.
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  Trump is a builder and understands affordable housing and the housing issue like no one we've ever had as president.
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  His father made his fortune building people after the war, affordable housing.
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  So if he just stays focused on the agenda.
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  So the answer is deliver prosperity so fast, it totally discredited some even more.
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  He's the ultimate free enterprise guy.
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:45:58.000]  He's the ultimate entrepreneur.
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:00.000]  He wants to make this country cook.
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:03.000]  He understands that if you revive the economy.
[1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:09.000]  If you unleash the free enterprise system, we can have money for all the other things we need to do.
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:13.000]  By the way, Roger, you and I talked about the fact that this could be bigger than 1776.
[1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:16.000]  If he delivers, that was the birth we were about to die.
[1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:20.000]  If this all happens, it'll be bigger than 1776.
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:22.000]  He'll be bigger than George Washington.
[1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:24.000]  And I'm not just somebody that just says that.
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  I'm telling you, they're going to be building Trump monuments on Mars in 100 years that are five times bigger than the Washington.
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:35.000]  I mean, I'm telling you, I can see the whole thing now.
[1:46:35.000 --> 1:46:37.000]  Let me ask you this, and now you got to go.
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:40.000]  I know there's a lot of real suppressed technologies.
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:44.000]  I don't mean the stuff that we hear about, you know, in the books and things that get written that are fiction.
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:46.000]  I mean, I know there's been a lot of real suppressed technologies.
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  Things are doled out.
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:48.000]  They're selectively doled out.
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  There's a lot of major treatments for cancer, other diseases, a lot of things that the elite plan to hoard.
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:59.000]  Trump signaled he's going to start flooding that out, getting drugs approved quicker, getting other things out.
[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:05.000]  Ending sickness, ending death, you know, ending cancer like we ended, you know, things like smallpox.
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:07.000]  This is such an exciting time.
[1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:10.000]  I'm talking about space exploration, unlocking the secrets of the universe.
[1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:15.000]  I know for a fact that, you know, they had laser weapons they were using in war in Vietnam.
[1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:17.000]  They used them heavily in Panama.
[1:47:17.000 --> 1:47:18.000]  That's just an example.
[1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:21.000]  I mean, everything's 30 years more advanced than they're telling us.
[1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:24.000]  They're only on governmental reservations and corporate reservations.
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:26.000]  I've had family that was privy to some of this.
[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:27.000]  That's how I know.
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  They didn't give me the classified info.
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:30.000]  They just said you wouldn't believe it.
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  So the fact that Trump with American dominance is getting ready to deploy stuff bigger than the Internet for the economy, but also for life.
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  How soon do we start seeing that?
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:42.000]  Well, look, any nothing big happens quickly.
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  But you have somebody who believes in American exceptionalism who's going to do a technological review and see how we can unleash the ingenuity and the creativity
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  and the technological ability of the American free enterprise system.
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  This is a guy who says he's going to appoint Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to join a task force to examine vaccinations.
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  Let's get to the bottom of CDC and that issue.
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:15.000]  He's interested in facts, Alex.
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  He's a pragmatist interested in getting things done.
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  At the same time, he has two or three, you know, bedrock American principles.
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  He's not going to violate America first.
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  He made that clear.
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  Every trade deal, every new law, every new regulation doesn't put the people's interests first.
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  That alone will be refreshing.
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:41.000]  He's not afraid to say that we have a, you know, a divine creator.
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:45.000]  He's not afraid to bring back references to God and to Christmas.
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:52.000]  He understands that that also, again, breaks the back of political correctness, but it also really does invoke the fact that the state isn't God.
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  There's a God above that.
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:55.000]  That moves us up above the state.
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  It's really amazing.
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  Other tidbits that I'm going to let you go, Roger, the book now available.
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  Pre-order, when does it specifically come out?
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  Again, the making of a president 2016.
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  Making the president 2016, how Donald Trump orchestrated an American revolution will be in bookstores and will be shipped on January 31st.
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  You can get a very good price on it on the InfoWars store.
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  It's also available, you know, at Amazon and Barnes & Noble and Stone.
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  And it's StoneColdTruth.com.
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  StoneColdTruth.com.
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:26.000]  Now, listen, I want to celebrate.
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  I want to be positive.
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  Okay.
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  But at the same time, I want to have the win long term in the continuum.
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  Again, real quick, how do you expect them to strike back?
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  I mean, as I said earlier, they're spoiling the, you know, the billionaires are intensifying funding to stop Trump not backing off.
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  I don't think they get that, you know, their money wasn't worth anything.
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  People are on to them and that no amount of BS is going to put their new world order back together again.
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  In all honesty, Alex, you have to read this book to understand what's going on right now.
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  And for anybody who buys the book through InfoWars.com at the store, I will supply you at my own expense a book plate with a personal inscription that you can attach to your book.
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  So, but to understand the struggle with the globalists, to understand how the mainstream media has lost their monopoly and how this entire political communication system has tipped to the alternative media like InfoWars, this is detailed in the book.
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  You made a very important point at the beginning that I have to come back to.
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  People do not understand how to gauge how big this revolutionary army is.
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  If you look at the people who are watching Alex Jones at InfoWars and so many of your fine correspondents on, you know, the net, plus Facebook live, plus YouTube live, plus podcast, plus radio, you're dwarfing Sean Hannity.
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  Nothing against Sean Hannity is too important.
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  Warfing them in reaching the Trump foot soldiers.
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  And again, it's, well, I mean, we saw it and I'm not bragging. And one thing that the Chicago Tribune got right with as other celebrities, you know, stay away from Trump, Alex Jones is there.
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  Another peer pressure move, like I'm a loser. I'm not cool. Yeah, just the most revolutionary president since George Washington total change. I'm there.
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  They admitted the article trying to make me look bad. They go, every other person was a huge fan. Every other person wanted to meet this big ego maniac.
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  They were sitting there quietly watching the speech being mobbed. You were getting mobbed so bad I had to leave the area you were in right below the president.
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  I almost had to go because it was becoming a disturbance. Everyone wanting selfies. People all saw the live streams. It wasn't just Trump supporters.
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:44.000]  It was like black cops, female cops, white cops. It was people stopping taxis, you know, people from India. It was all over the place.
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  At the restaurant, I was eating it. They were bringing me free food, free drinks. I mean, it was just absolutely insane for me to see how big it is.
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:52:01.000]  I mean, it's already, I can't walk down the street in Austin. Every fifth person's a listener. It was half and the Chicago Tribune, I think you guys can Google the article.
[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  I think it was titled, the article was titled, you know, as celebrities, you know, Sean Trump, Alex Jones is there.
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  We're just typing Alex Jones, click nose, and then in the type of Chicago Tribune. But what I'm saying is, is they had to admit every other, you know, there it is.
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  Celeb, steer clear of President Trump, not Alex Jones. And then they make some joke out of it. Like, like we're, again, they play like sophomore at games.
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:31.000]  It's like fighting them. It's like I'm back in third grade or something. It's so mentally ill. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  Alex, I just don't think they fully understand the reach because they're the old media, the networks, the cable networks, they're losing their monopoly and they resent what you are doing.
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  Number one, number two, they want to talk about, you know, Sandy Hook in 911 and extraneous matters. Those are important issues. You have your views.
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:53:06.000]  Trump is about stealing our borders, revitalizing our economy, peace with the Russians, getting us an immigration system that works.
[1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  Well, he said it. He said, we've been negotiating deals and selling off America for an elite. That's what globalism is. It's over. It's about oppressing people worldwide.
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:21.000]  It's a new colonialism against the West and everybody else. It's over. But getting back to this then, I agree with you.
[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  What happens to MSM now as they prepare to sell off CNN? The word is MSNBC is going to be basically sold off and lay off half its people.
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  So they're kind of shutting down, but the foundation Soros isn't giving up. So what is that dichotomy? What is that going to be like?
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:52.000]  Alex, who knows? Maybe RT will buy CNN, spin it off, and fire Jeff Zucker. Anything is possible. But you're going to have these kind of personal attacks. They distort your views on other subjects.
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:54:03.000]  They call me a racist and a misogynist and a bigot. I was out marching against the racist Rockefeller drug reform laws. I was supporting Richard Nixon.
[1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:08.000]  No, I know you were. I know it was the Republicans that ended slavery.
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  I resent this nonsense that I'm a racist because I once called Roland Martin stupid. I'm sorry.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:21.000]  Here's the deal. They know you're not. They just use it like it's a magic word.
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:25.000]  Yeah, it's a bogus false attack.
[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  Frankly, I want to make everybody so successful and so wealthy and so into Americana that I don't care what color somebody is. They marry my daughters as long as they're a patriot.
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  The problem is I can't probably find anybody that's a patriot. The globalists keep winning with young people.
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  And the good news is I saw massive numbers of young people that were there and were awake of every race, color, and creed. It was very, very exciting.
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:59.000]  Yeah, no, I think this is where you really can take solace and that is the people who, you know, came to me and wanting selfies and wanted autographs and wanted to be to shake hands with them or sign their books or sign their programs.
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  They're all young people. They're they're the future generation of revolutionaries and they get it.
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  You know, I'm reminded something that President Nixon once said to me, Alex, we were going through an airport. We were late for a flight and a woman popped up and said, oh, Mr. President, can I get your autograph?
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  Despite the fact that we were late to the gate, Nixon signed her autograph with a flourish and asked her where she was from.
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  And after we got out of earshot, he said to me, never refuse a request for an autograph or they'll think you're a real asshole.
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  You know, it was it was an exciting time. And it was great to be with so many like minded patriots, people who see the big picture and understand that we're not interested in, you know, in aggrandizing ourselves, we're in a revolution.
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  Absolutely. I mean, I mean, one thing the Russians have gotten is they're like this new group of Americans just want ideology of freedom and just want prosperity and to work with everyone.
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  And people say, well, doesn't Russia know if Trump's built the military? You know, he might still. Russia is so hungry for the chance to actually work with the United States.
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  And we've got so many real enemies. Don't worry. There's going to be plenty of bombs to drop on the jihadis. And again, Ron Paul, who I love to death, the globalist helped create them.
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  They're taking over the world. We have to defeat them or the world go on forever. We have to destroy ISIS. We have to get Saudi Arabia back in its rat hole.
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  You know, it's the Saudi leadership. Clearly there's an alliance with the New World Order and the Islamist that has got to be defeated.
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  So I'm going to tell Ron Paul that on Wednesday and bring up, you know, sir, listen, I understand you're against war. I support you.
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  But, but, you know, Saudi Arabia and the globalist carried out 9 11 so they could take out Iraq and all these countries. They're the real enemy.
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  But Donald Trump understands that when we took our ill-advised actions in Libya, we had to go borrow as a country $1 billion to pay for the bombs for an aggressive war.
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  Now, we can keep borrowing money to pay for bombs and missiles and guns and weapons, or we can use that money to rebuild our military strength.
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  At the same time, finding a way to rebuild our infrastructure.
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:17.000]  They were running our military in the ground. I know you've got to go. Thank you, Roger. We'll talk to you soon.
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  Great to be here with you, Alex. Many thanks.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:27.000]  You bet. Well, so much has happened. And I know I've been so fired up that I just did like, you know, two hours here and I haven't covered any of this massive stack of news.
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:31.000]  I've covered some of it. We've got other guests coming up, a lot more to break down today.
[1:57:31.000 --> 1:57:35.000]  And I have just been a wild man when it comes to skipping breaks. I'm not going to do that in the next few days.
[1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  I apologize to the network or everybody else. But those are network breaks so I can do it.
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:47.000]  It's just such an amazing time. But I have to go over how the enemy's bad because I understand a lot of positive things are happening.
[1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:51.000]  But these are nasty, horrible people and they've got to be defeated.
[1:57:51.000 --> 1:57:58.000]  Also, we're going to play all these because the crew spends hours getting all these clips together.
[1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:03.000]  We've got feminism funded by the CIA. Very powerful inauguration day. Reboot 2.0. Very powerful.
[1:58:03.000 --> 1:58:08.000]  Trump tells business leaders he wants to cut regulation by 75% or more.
[1:58:08.000 --> 1:58:13.000]  Maybe more. President Trump calls out fake news for lying about his feud with the intelligence community.
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:16.000]  Madonna says blow up the White House.
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:22.000]  Shia LaBeoufie verbally and physically assaults Trump supporter.
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:26.000]  Anti-Trump protestor lights girls hair on fire.
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:34.000]  When we come back, I want to play the derangement because I saw this myself, this type of behavior, of one of these poor brainwashed victims.
[1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:37.000]  Passengers cheer as women berating Trump supporter kicked off plane.
[1:58:37.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  Spicer slams media in first day briefing. Van Jones says Trump's Hitler.
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:45.000]  Give me a break, man. He's the opposite of Hitler. You piece of filth.
[1:58:45.000 --> 1:58:49.000]  Hitler wanted to expand. Trump just wants to be free.
[1:58:51.000 --> 1:58:54.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here with the inauguration special.
[1:58:54.000 --> 1:58:58.000]  We've had some of the biggest sales in our history since Christmas into the New Year.
[1:58:58.000 --> 1:59:04.000]  I'm extending them as the inauguration specials right through this weekend and then it's over.
[1:59:04.000 --> 1:59:07.000]  We have some new products coming out next week. Some other sales we're going to be doing.
[1:59:07.000 --> 1:59:11.000]  But many of these sales are going to have to come to an end.
[1:59:11.000 --> 1:59:16.000]  If you want across the board massive specials on hundreds and hundreds of items like
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  Rainforest 30% off and 20% more in each bottle. Survival Shield X2 30% off. Here's the bottom line.
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:28.000]  These are great products that have changed my life and changed so many other people's lives.
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:36.000]  Also, it funds the operation. This sale ends this weekend after the inauguration of Donald J. Trump as the 45th president.
[1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:58.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:06.000 --> 2:00:15.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:45.000]  There's another Merle Haggard song I want to play that on the fight inside of me.
[2:00:45.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  I think that's on the computer in there, but we should get that.
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:58.000]  I want to play that later in the broadcast.
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:08.000]  I tell you, Trump is so delivering. I didn't want to just sit here and bitch at the government all day and talk about this corruption.
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:15.000]  Just because I hated America, I was doing it because I hated seeing America be run down the tubes.
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  But Trump is so bold and I've looked at what they're actually doing. It's so fair and so good.
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:29.000]  And so symbiotic. So the other side gets a good deal as well so that there's actual trade.
[2:01:29.000 --> 2:01:37.000]  And then I see these people attacking him and how ugly spiritually they are and how vicious they are and how mindless they are and how controlled they are.
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  And it just is a weird paradox because the light in the eyes, the spirit of goodness, the opposite of hate in the Trump supporters was so amazing.
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  When you looked at the other side, they were physically ugly.
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:02:03.000]  But there was an ugliness about them beyond their physical traits. It was just a sunkenness.
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:17.000]  The eyes were all sunk in. They had no spirit. They felt like soulless creatures. Their aura was like hell.
[2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:25.000]  Yet at hell, people just resonate to their own energy. Hell's where all the people like them go, God doesn't even put them there in my gut view.
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:29.000]  It's that they resonate towards their own energy.
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:41.000]  And hell would be an eternity with all those zombies and slaves just stumbling around screaming out mindless slogans.
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:49.000]  They're weak. They're ugly. They have nothing but hate. And it's so clear. I always do. They lie and twist. Everything they say is the opposite.
[2:02:49.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  They say we work for foreign powers. They work for foreign powers.
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  They say we're racist. They're screaming. You're an effing white male and they're white. They're pushing race-based stuff.
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:07.000]  They say they're hateful and they're just frothing and screaming and just...
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:11.000]  And they come over and say, give me a hug. Why are you so hateful? I go, okay. And then they go, half you, some of them.
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  Because once they got, like, will you take a picture with me? Will you take a picture?
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:25.000]  And I'm like, sure. Nah, I don't want to. They just wanted me to, like, refuse them so that they could act like I didn't love them individually.
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:33.000]  Believe me, I didn't go out there because I hated you.
[2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:41.000]  Because if I hated you, I would be using you just like your masters do.
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:53.000]  They're just... They're leaderless people. They didn't have ancestors. And I'm not bragging about it, but I think the greatest thing I have, my greatest possession, is that I come from good people.
[2:03:53.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  Weren't screwing folks over and who were dedicated and hardworking and loving and creative. And just be glad, folks, that whatever happened to them and their family lines, it's not us.
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:13.000]  Because let me tell you, the family of this audience, and I'm not saying this to give you some spree to core or make you feel special.
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:23.000]  You really are the light of the world, bringing back the salt, bringing back the guts, bringing back everything that really allows our civilization to flourish.
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  You're it. You're the hope. You're the resistance. You're everything. All our hopes go with you.
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  I tell my son that, everything. You've got to be strong. You've got to be upright. You've got to be a good person.
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:41.000]  Because all God's hopes and dreams go with you, not just mine.
[2:04:41.000 --> 2:04:46.000]  We've had this big victory, but we're being given it because people prayed and fought and took action.
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  But let me tell you, I can see the next enemy waves coming in, especially down the road.
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:05:21.000]  We're going to look back and wish we could move quicker and fought harder with what's coming. Stay with us.
[2:05:22.000 --> 2:05:26.000]  It's time for you to take a bite of Humble Pie, and the election of Donald Trump is the pill you have to swallow.
[2:05:26.000 --> 2:05:32.000]  You need to know your douchebag sense of entitlement is so palpable that it makes you the ugliest person in the room.
[2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:38.000]  And if you don't come off your self-made soapbox now, you will soon be the most lonely, desperate, desolate people on earth.
[2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:46.000]  Donald Trump is your president. The reality is, Donald Trump is the president, America elected him, and we're here to make America great again.
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:51.000]  Make Planet Earth great again, expose the fake news media, and change the world.
[2:05:51.000 --> 2:05:55.000]  You can either join us or be a humorous footnote in the world history.
[2:05:55.000 --> 2:05:58.000]  Thanks to everyone so much for the love shown over the course of this journey.
[2:05:58.000 --> 2:06:22.000]  Donald Trump is our president. Now let's get to work.
[2:06:28.000 --> 2:06:34.000]  Donald really happened with the Russians, and so much more, and it supports him, and it supports Info Wars, our whole operation.
[2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:39.000]  So it's essential that this book go to the top of the charts in the political area, if not to the very top of the charts.
[2:06:39.000 --> 2:06:43.000]  Joe Biden has come out and said world government is collapsing. They're in full crisis mode.
[2:06:43.000 --> 2:06:49.000]  Nationalist movements are exploding. Everybody needs to go pre-order, so you get it first at infowarstore.com.
[2:06:49.000 --> 2:06:52.000]  The Making of a President by Roger Stone. I'm Alex Jones.
[2:06:52.000 --> 2:06:59.000]  I'm going airplane to go to the inaugural event with Trump, pray for us, and please, Tina, support the operation, and get his book mouse.
[2:06:59.000 --> 2:07:00.000]  You're the first to have it shipped to you.
[2:07:00.000 --> 2:07:07.000]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned. It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[2:07:07.000 --> 2:07:13.000]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[2:07:13.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:30.000]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job you can to purify your air.
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:38.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:44.000]  The general public doesn't. The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[2:07:44.000 --> 2:07:48.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[2:07:48.000 --> 2:07:54.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[2:07:54.000 --> 2:08:09.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today, and then fullwarstore.com.
[2:08:25.000 --> 2:08:33.000]  And I don't mind them switching sides and standing up for things they believe in.
[2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:36.000]  Look at my left-hand phone roll a little bit.
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:39.000]  Well, it shows some footage of the inauguration.
[2:08:39.000 --> 2:08:41.000]  Those big crowds, they say didn't exist.
[2:08:41.000 --> 2:08:43.000]  They're not dumb, they think you are.
[2:08:43.000 --> 2:08:49.000]  To show the gates when they open at 8.30, people just start pouring in, because they don't want to show nobody.
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:55.000]  People know that would be a lie. You see them all pouring in, they don't show you hours later when it's the biggest crowd ever.
[2:08:55.000 --> 2:08:59.000]  Or they say, yeah, you took out the Martin Luther King bus, and the whole media runs with it.
[2:08:59.000 --> 2:09:08.000]  And it's just ongoing.
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:11.000]  It's not like our country is North Korea, this is a country worth defending.
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:17.000]  They're afraid of it. The idea, in Europe, there was a Renaissance, you weren't allowed to have your own business, you had to work for a lord.
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:20.000]  The Renaissance was about little people.
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:25.000]  Restaurants didn't exist then, because the elite wouldn't let somebody open one.
[2:09:25.000 --> 2:09:32.000]  Basically, if you had a tavern or a hotel, there could be like maybe one on the road, because it was authorized by the local lord.
[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:37.000]  And it had huge prices, because you had to buy it there.
[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:42.000]  It's a country store, a company store where they overcharge you.
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:48.000]  You can be a sharecropper here, but you got to buy your food here. You got to buy your clothes here. It costs five times what it should.
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:50.000]  That's all globalism is.
[2:09:50.000 --> 2:10:03.000]  And if you want to rip people off and not have competition, you're walking on the fighting side of the inheritors of the greatest experiment ever in the Renaissance.
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:13.000]  And I talk about Renaissance constantly, because other people don't understand how historical it is. Now you're hearing it.
[2:10:13.000 --> 2:10:18.000]  I knew we were having big success over a decade ago, but I didn't know how big.
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:23.000]  And now, listeners have to know the little things you do add together, they're huge.
[2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:28.000]  Leigh Ann, you were here watching the footage, going out, covering things. There was the big march of women here as well.
[2:10:28.000 --> 2:10:34.000]  We are deceived. It's much bigger than it would have been, obviously. The fact that he won has really freaked them out.
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:39.000]  And they really think Hitler's coming for them with Van Jones and the Pope all saying he's Hitler.
[2:10:39.000 --> 2:10:44.000]  I mean, I know in the last couple of years, some people were kind of a little on the fence about Trump as time's gone on.
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:51.000]  I never ordered anybody around here to get behind Trump. Some people were again in the middle of the road or didn't like him.
[2:10:51.000 --> 2:10:56.000]  Everybody here has come over to Trump and then said, wow, he's better than we thought he'd be.
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:11:02.000]  And now seeing that speech saying this isn't liberal or conservative, this is about empowerment and coming together
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:09.000]  and everyone racially loving each other and working together. And it wasn't done from a stirring up old wounds perspective.
[2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:16.000]  It was, we're great. We got red blood. Let's go to the stars. And that just had the enemy so upset.
[2:11:16.000 --> 2:11:22.000]  Everyone's faces and, you know, CNN actually put out this gigapixel photograph of the inauguration.
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:26.000]  They debunked themselves on that crowd size. You can go to it and see how huge the crowd was.
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:33.000]  But you can also go behind Donald Trump and see all the people, all the elitists that he was speaking specifically to,
[2:11:33.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  the people who have been serving themselves rather than being public servants.
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:43.000]  And it's okay to be rich and successful if you build something that people then pay you for and it's a good price.
[2:11:43.000 --> 2:11:49.000]  But you don't just take over everything and then make everybody poor because you can get more out of them for each thing you sell them.
[2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:53.000]  Exactly. And tell them they're going to be in trouble for insider trading and things like that.
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:11:56.000]  But then exempt yourself so you can get rich off the back of the people,
[2:11:56.000 --> 2:11:59.000]  but then make it so that no one else can get rich and you should live in.
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:04.000]  And by the way, the Republicans said, hey, you know, let's, let's, let's, let's keep this law where we can insider trade.
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:09.000]  Trump said, we're getting rid of that. Guess who isn't the stock market, Donald Trump?
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:15.000]  Look at this CNN's gigapixel. Look at there. You can see the crowds filled in. Obviously, yes.
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:20.000]  And can we just put it to rest? Of course, more people were there for Obama's inauguration.
[2:12:20.000 --> 2:12:27.000]  It was a historical B. It was lined up with MLK day. So of course, there were more people in town period, whatever.
[2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  Well, no, let's be clear. Let's be clear. They didn't have to fence off that much.
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:35.000]  They won't let you stand on those, those, those, those areas that are covered up.
[2:12:35.000 --> 2:12:37.000]  Right. So they show, oh, look, there's areas with no people.
[2:12:37.000 --> 2:12:40.000]  Well, look how it's symmetrical. Go back to the radio listeners.
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:43.000]  I'll describe this. Go back to the back. Go back to down Pennsylvania.
[2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:49.000]  The metro found like 550,000 people use it for Obama's first. It was only 300 something thousand.
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:56.000]  The point is CNN showed a photo earlier of 8 30 in the morning when the gates first opened and said nobody was there.
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:12:59.000]  Well, and also two people on Twitter, they're fighting about it.
[2:12:59.000 --> 2:13:05.000]  They're like, well, if you come from the other, the opposite angle, looking toward Trump from the monument, it looks more sparse.
[2:13:05.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  Well, okay, that's fine. Then Donald Trump is not wrong when he says it went all the way back to the monument.
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:19.000]  You know what I mean? So it's like either way, you look at this argument, but they just have a meanwhile, meanwhile, I couldn't get in for an over an hour
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:22.000]  because they were beating people up and attacking them, trying to get in.
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:28.000]  Look at that fake crap. They, I mean, they debunk themselves with their own pixelated photo.
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:33.000]  In fact, no one's done this properly. When I'm going to shoot a video after the show today and I'm going to show CNN debunks itself.
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  And I guess we just kind of did it right now. They show their, you know, their 8 30 in the morning photo and it's almost empty.
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:45.000]  They doubled down with this photo yesterday at the gym. That's why I got so triggered and I had to come on to the show yesterday.
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:49.000]  Because then again, CNN's like, Trump said we lied here. We'll show you the photo.
[2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:52.000]  They're incredible. We'll show you the photo. And what do you think they're thinking?
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:55.000]  Because they keep getting caught and then they double down.
[2:13:55.000 --> 2:14:05.000]  What they're thinking is that people, these morons that only get their news via CNN, they think that they're going to get by on the fact.
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:13.000]  This is when he's being sworn in. This is CNN's own megapixel photo on their own site, showing it completely full all the way to the back.
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:20.000]  Right. Now let's go to a shot when they first opened the gates because they didn't have it all get it off as far back in 2009.
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:24.000]  They had to with this because of all the threats. Now look at that. Right.
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:30.000]  Look, look, look at that. I mean, if you're a radio listener, we're going to put this video up on info wars.com.
[2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  They are crazy, but but Lee and they think you're crazy. And not only that, but CNN also refused to cover the fact that there were mobs of people blocking off all the entrance or beating people up, beating people up.
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:48.000]  And the police were wearing pink condom head hats like the women protesters and letting them do it to us. Yeah.
[2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:54.000]  We want to have just started told to stand down. We just want to have just ran over people. Well, you know, in fact, I did it twice.
[2:14:54.000 --> 2:15:00.000]  And that came to another group. I just ran them over again. Of course, it was, I mean, I normally run over them anyways, but I did have some pretty tough guys with me.
[2:15:00.000 --> 2:15:05.000]  Why one guy like he like through six people.
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:10.000]  That was their moment, you know, they were allowed to be tough and feel like the top, you know, that they think the world is theirs.
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:12.000]  That's why you had the older woman.
[2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:17.000]  I saw one anarchist like punch this really big guy was just going to his job.
[2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:24.000]  And he tells him because they were blocking a normal street, not just not just the entrances like up there. And I saw it. I was waiting for my credentials.
[2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:28.000]  The cabby was bringing him to me, but that we paid to drive him over to me.
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:33.000]  And I'm outside just watching him beat women attack people and this big guy is going through. He's got a lunchbox.
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:37.000]  He said, I work in that building, not their construction. They're building a building. He goes, I got to get there.
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:43.000]  He waits like 10 minutes and I'm waiting for my credentials and the anarchists are like, I was going to kick your ass next.
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:48.000]  All of a sudden, like they're hitting people. All of a sudden, this guy and a woman hit him.
[2:15:48.000 --> 2:15:52.000]  He just knocks them both out. The woman comes back. He knocks her down again because he's hitting him.
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:15:57.000]  And then the anarchist runs over and hits him and he knocks him up against the wall and the cops finally come over.
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:16:03.000]  But it was it was state police. They come over and tase the anarchist and the big guy goes to the work site.
[2:16:03.000 --> 2:16:07.000]  But imagine he's clearly got a lunchbox. He's not a Trump supporter.
[2:16:07.000 --> 2:16:11.000]  He goes, I'm going to that construction site right by the condo. They were building a new building.
[2:16:11.000 --> 2:16:14.000]  They torn one down. They just start attacking you.
[2:16:14.000 --> 2:16:17.000]  Screaming you're a white racist and they were white.
[2:16:17.000 --> 2:16:22.000]  Order doesn't matter to these people. They want complete chaos, complete anarchy.
[2:16:22.000 --> 2:16:27.000]  Why would they attack some working class schmo in a construction outfit with a lunchbox?
[2:16:27.000 --> 2:16:32.000]  That's a viral video because Q's in it. I'm down. I'm across the street.
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:36.000]  Q went over. He tells the cops, one of my security guys, he goes, if you're not going to do something, I'm going over there.
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:41.000]  And so he goes over there and by then it got shut down. But that's on the viral video. I told him to give that to you.
[2:16:41.000 --> 2:16:43.000]  I don't know if he did, but it's one of the most viral videos out there.
[2:16:43.000 --> 2:16:49.000]  Well, then you just see them all in their little skinny jeans. They got zero muscle tone, you know, zero strength.
[2:16:49.000 --> 2:16:53.000]  The only strength that they have is that they can hide under their balaclavas in their group.
[2:16:53.000 --> 2:16:56.000]  So one will come out and hit and then they run back into the crowd.
[2:16:56.000 --> 2:17:01.000]  You can't tell them apart because they all the same. They're like a little insect army, little army event.
[2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:03.000]  I mean, look at these dweebs.
[2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:07.000]  They don't get on trash can. They don't get something done. Look how tough we are. And then they go.
[2:17:07.000 --> 2:17:10.000]  You don't hurt McDonald's bashing the windows out. You expose this GMO crap.
[2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:14.000]  Oh, and Bill Gates is part of McDonald's and then on the board, Monsanto is.
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:16.000]  Oh, but guess who's fighting them? Bill Gates.
[2:17:16.000 --> 2:17:21.000]  And these are the same people that donated a lot of money to Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[2:17:21.000 --> 2:17:25.000]  It's like they didn't donate to Donald Trump's campaign. They donated.
[2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:28.000]  I remember a lot of radio listeners can't see this. Leanne, we found a clip.
[2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:33.000]  I'm going to get ready to play it after the break. Gloria Steinem back in the 60s talking about the CIA
[2:17:33.000 --> 2:17:37.000]  and how it funded her and her foundation and the foundations funded her.
[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:40.000]  Again, people say, wow, that's what you always say. It's it's declassified.
[2:17:40.000 --> 2:17:44.000]  It's true. It is not to empower women. There was already a women's rights movement.
[2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:47.000]  Okay. And that was all part of the Western.
[2:17:47.000 --> 2:17:51.000]  The world was led by the West and women empowerment.
[2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:55.000]  Then they act like we're the people disempowering women when that's where it came from in the West.
[2:17:55.000 --> 2:17:58.000]  Right. And women have always been more honored in the West.
[2:17:58.000 --> 2:18:01.000]  Now they've inverted that and we've got Gloria Steinem.
[2:18:01.000 --> 2:18:05.000]  And I pulled some of the articles we're going to show them for people and also go over them.
[2:18:05.000 --> 2:18:11.000]  Admitting in mainstream news that the CIA ran Miss Magazine, all of it to control it and break up the family.
[2:18:11.000 --> 2:18:15.000]  And they just admit all of this and they're doing it again today, Leanne.
[2:18:15.000 --> 2:18:19.000]  Cultural Marxism. It's all right there. We got the documents.
[2:18:19.000 --> 2:18:23.000]  It's not like they're trying to hide their plans. I mean, it's all right there in black and white.
[2:18:23.000 --> 2:18:29.000]  What do you think of the women running up and just screaming, thinking any, basically any masculine male is the enemy?
[2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:34.000]  I just think I'm really kind of frightened. You know, like I pointed out that cover, the National Geographic Magazine,
[2:18:34.000 --> 2:18:39.000]  how women aren't even included on the cover of the gender revolution.
[2:18:39.000 --> 2:18:43.000]  Oh, yeah. Talk about that. In the future, women and men don't even exist.
[2:18:43.000 --> 2:18:44.000]  Right.
[2:18:44.000 --> 2:18:51.000]  Because see, if we exist male and female in that relationship of the normal species, that is the species, then it's hurting others.
[2:18:51.000 --> 2:18:56.000]  Well, that's the whole cultural Marxism thing. We all have to be the same. There's no gender. There's no culture.
[2:18:56.000 --> 2:19:05.000]  It's the cultural Marxism and it's a failure. It's failed in the past, but this is what they hope is that we're all just this sort of sub-speaker.
[2:19:05.000 --> 2:19:10.000]  And really, they've sexualized some little kid in National Geographic. Let's show the cover.
[2:19:10.000 --> 2:19:13.000]  And this is really just basically pervert behavior.
[2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:15.000]  So here's this. I think they have a few different...
[2:19:15.000 --> 2:19:19.000]  The gender revolution. We put chemicals in your water. This is always gone.
[2:19:19.000 --> 2:19:26.000]  We're not mad at anybody that feels like this. The point is this is always gone on some, but now they're forcing it is the point with the chemicals.
[2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:32.000]  Well, my point and what made me so angry about that cover is fine. Sure, you want to talk about the gender revolution. That's fine.
[2:19:32.000 --> 2:19:33.000]  Where are men and women?
[2:19:33.000 --> 2:19:37.000]  Where's just the straight-up woman, your heterosexual female?
[2:19:37.000 --> 2:19:41.000]  No, no, no. Now that all these campuses and stuff, that's not allowed. You're not welcome.
[2:19:41.000 --> 2:19:43.000]  And then I started getting yelled at.
[2:19:43.000 --> 2:19:46.000]  And it's a bully. It's a cult. They're forcing you into it. Sorry. What happened?
[2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:50.000]  They're like, you don't believe transgender women are real women? Like attacking me?
[2:19:50.000 --> 2:19:55.000]  So see now, the only real woman is a transgender. See now, now you're being replaced.
[2:19:55.000 --> 2:20:19.000]  It's a scientific revolution that would be run by aliens if they were actually in control.

[2:22:49.000 --> 2:23:10.000]  In a crisis, your number one need is food, but not just any food. Experts say everyone needs to have non-perishable, good for 25 years, survival food on hand in case of an emergency.
[2:23:10.000 --> 2:23:19.000]  Well, right now, in what is truly an unprecedented move, 72-hour survival food kits are being given away to listeners while supplies last.
[2:23:19.000 --> 2:23:24.000]  Survival food is more important today than ever before, explains Frank Bates, a spokesman for the company.
[2:23:24.000 --> 2:23:30.000]  Natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and other threats can make obtaining sufficient food impossible in an emergency.
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:44.000]  This 72-hour survival kit has 16 servings of delicious food rated for 25 years of storage. It sells to the general public for $27 plus shipping, and it's been rated 4.5 out of 5 stars by customers who paid full price.
[2:23:44.000 --> 2:24:01.000]  But listeners who act quickly can get it free, just cover $9.95 shipping. Go to freefood2.com right now. Supplies are limited and the program may end at any time. Go to freefood2.com now. That's freefood2.com.
[2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:52.000]  I've got so many clips to get to. We'll start doing the next segment. And I believe one of the other reporters coming in that was at the Women's March and got attacked.
[2:24:52.000 --> 2:25:01.000]  Yeah, and she's a black lady. It's just crazy how hateful these grips are. But again, they've been entitled to go out and act like this.
[2:25:01.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  But here's Gloria Steinem back in the 1960s on national television bragging about how the CIA recruited her to take over the women's movement with the foundations.
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:20.000]  They knew about her work with the foundations. They wanted to work with her. The foundations created the CIA.
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:32.000]  Okay, this is all declassified. This came out in the 70s, congressional hearings. I keep talking about foundations. They're the ones that talk about putting chemicals in the plastics to confuse the sexuality of men, make them feminine,
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  make women hyper feminine, but that gives them breast cancer. That's what the Glyphosates and the chemicals and all of it do.
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:49.000]  And I was seeing that the people most affected by the chemicals, most susceptible, you could see them, they were really screwed up, were the people out there protesting Trump.
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:57.000]  These are the people that this project was successful ruining. Here's Gloria Steinem that helped destroy the American family. Here she is.
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:26:02.000]  Gloria, at the festival you worked for the Independent Research Service.
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:12.000]  Well, exactly when did your own association with the CIA start and in what fashion? Did they come to you or did you go to them?
[2:26:12.000 --> 2:26:19.000]  In 1958, when I came home from...
[2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:21.000]  I don't know.
[2:26:21.000 --> 2:26:30.000] ...leaders, past and present of many of them active with the National Student Association, this kind of small foundation to encourage Americans to go.
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:51.000]  They thought it was a good idea too. I was then told by foundations and professors and friends that I should not do this, that I would get in trouble with the House and American Activities Committee, the American Legion, all of those 50s people.
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:27:08.000]  And I became convinced that it was impossible. It was at that point that the student leaders said to me that they had in the past received funds for international programs from the CIA and that they felt that this was important and could also be partly funded by the CIA.
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:11.000]  Did you feel that you really tried? I mean, did you go around...
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:24.000]  Oh, the House and Un-American Activities claim there was a secret CIA army-directed program to break up the family. Everything that he said has come out to be true.
[2:27:24.000 --> 2:27:33.000]  Joseph McCarthy, the Russians he classified it a decade ago, now the Russians realize they were put under an accelerated program that we are now under.
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:44.000]  The same people that did what they did to Russia are now trying it here. They just had to do it slower because we were so much stronger. The Tsars were somewhat oppressive, so the Russians never really had the freedom.
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:52.000]  They had been under autocratic rule, but it was much less worse than this. It was at least Christian and family-oriented, so it was easier to do under Communist.
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:28:00.000]  But now that's all declassified. And Russian national TV admits all this and plays these clips. And now that's the kinship we have that Russia has been oppressed by the very same group.
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:10.000]  She's like, oh, these 50s people, yeah, you know, all the people that made America, oh, we had to get around them and we couldn't get funding, so we got it from the CIA to do what?
[2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:19.000]  Tell women, you're no good if you stay home with your kids. You're scum. Not, hey, women can do great stuff and be in command jobs if they want it. Let's accept women in.
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:27.000]  No. You're nobody if you don't leave your kids in daycare and let us give them a bunch of shots and let the state take over. You're nobody if you don't let the state raise your kids.
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:38.000]  So that was the CIA. Now, who said that back in 1954? John Burr Society. They didn't just pull this out of their head. Why does the John Burr Society back then know everything?
[2:28:38.000 --> 2:28:46.000]  Because there were good people in the CIA and everywhere else that leaked it all, the plan. It just sounded so fantastic and the NSM was dominant.
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:52.000]  They were able to demonize people that were telling the truth, but not anymore because those seeds have now grown to mighty oaks.
[2:28:52.000 --> 2:29:05.000]  Yeah, well, I know you just you have reported many times in the past just on that 50 50 steps to the communist takeover of America and it was read into the congressional records in the 50s and just how unbelievable it is.
[2:29:05.000 --> 2:29:14.000]  And you were saying how difficult it was for them to implement this takeover here in the US because we were so aware of it. But then when you go back and you read those 50 steps, everything's been done.
[2:29:14.000 --> 2:29:17.000]  It's it's happening right now. It's in your face.
[2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:22.000]  And guess what? America finally realized it was under attack and got up and kicked ass.
[2:29:22.000 --> 2:29:25.000]  Yeah, well, let's we got to keep fighting now.
[2:29:25.000 --> 2:29:29.000]  I mean, the Giants bloody to stumbling around, but the little bloody goblin is running for its life.
[2:29:29.000 --> 2:29:32.000]  Yeah, we finally woke up from the stupor, though, just kind of.
[2:29:32.000 --> 2:29:35.000]  Well, I'm ranting. I want you to come back and go over some of these articles and some of the history of it.
[2:29:35.000 --> 2:29:39.000]  But like, I felt with the New York Times glorious time and CIA and I'm like, yeah, it's in her own book.
[2:29:39.000 --> 2:29:45.000]  Now we've got film of it that did air on 60 minutes later, but was from the New York Times and the Washington Post.
[2:29:45.000 --> 2:29:49.000]  Right. So there you go, folks, we'll be back. Stay with us.
[2:30:15.000 --> 2:30:21.000]  Trump were assaulting reporters, burning limos, smashing buildings, throwing stink bombs,
[2:30:21.000 --> 2:30:27.000]  disrupting the inauguration and other events that were happening, blocking streets, cursing at reporters.
[2:30:27.000 --> 2:30:33.000]  At the Women's March, you had people on the stage cursing repeatedly, talking about fallatio on air,
[2:30:33.000 --> 2:30:40.000]  saying Trump can fallatio himself, threatening to bomb the White House, wearing pussy hats, spitting on people.
[2:30:40.000 --> 2:30:43.000]  How about all the assassination threats we've seen on Twitter?
[2:30:43.000 --> 2:30:48.000]  We're not seeing any of that from Trump supporters. So after all, who are the real deplorables?
[2:30:48.000 --> 2:30:54.000]  I've said it once and I'll say it again. When they go low, they go really, really low.
[2:30:54.000 --> 2:31:22.000]  This is Owen Schreuer for infowars.com. Real news, fake deplorable.

[2:32:58.000 --> 2:33:22.000]  I'm Alex Jones, and this is the info war. This will be a day long remember. We've seen the end of the Clintons. We'll soon see the end of the globalists.
[2:33:22.000 --> 2:33:32.000]  This is the heart of 1776. It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[2:33:32.000 --> 2:33:43.000]  Move, bitch! Get out of the way! We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[2:33:43.000 --> 2:33:57.000]  The info wars helped you to remember that President Obama is an ISIS supporter. It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning. I will not let you down. You'll be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[2:33:57.000 --> 2:34:05.000]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones. This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th president of the United States.
[2:34:05.000 --> 2:34:11.000]  Waging war on corruption is Alex Jones.
[2:34:11.000 --> 2:34:21.000]  Go away. We are going to get into a lot of different issues here. What happened at the Women's March? Again, it's women. They just brand it. You're the alt-right.
[2:34:21.000 --> 2:34:32.000]  All women are for globalism at the end of the family and slitting their wrists and running around pouring gasoline on themselves. This is the brainwashing that we see and what we've dealt with.
[2:34:32.000 --> 2:34:42.000]  Before I do that, I want to talk about an event that happened Saturday as I was about to leave D.C. I had a condo right there on Pennsylvania Avenue.
[2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:56.000]  And as I come out of the condo on the ninth floor, I'm waiting for some of the other crew to come out of their rooms and out of the midst, almost out of the midst, it was like the lights weren't working at the end of the corridor.
[2:34:56.000 --> 2:35:05.000]  Out of the dark comes Ted Cruz. People make jokes about him and that. So I thought I'd go ahead and play this interview. Look, I do like Ted Cruz and some of the things he's done.
[2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:18.000]  He destroyed himself pretty bad early on. So we're going to play that report a little bit later. I said I would do that yesterday. I didn't get around to it, but at the little No Man's Land at the end of the hour, I'm going to play that.
[2:35:18.000 --> 2:35:32.000]  But before I do that, I'm going to air this report from this weekend, but it's very pertinent now. Inauguration Day Reboot, America 2.0. Inauguration Day Reboot, America 2.0. Here it is.
[2:35:32.000 --> 2:35:45.000]  The free press is central to our democracy and nah, I'm just kidding. You know I've got to talk about Trump. Come on.
[2:35:45.000 --> 2:35:49.000]  Which Republican candidate has the best chance of winning the general election?
[2:35:49.000 --> 2:35:53.000]  Of the declared ones right now, Donald Trump.
[2:35:53.000 --> 2:36:13.000]  Providence in motion, my fellow Americans. Whether you belong to Hillary's deplorable horde or you are the vilest commie, roaming the American taxpayer's streets of gold, one thing can't be denied. This is a new beginning.
[2:36:13.000 --> 2:36:18.000]  A new prayer of King Solomon from the Book of Wisdom. Let us pray.
[2:36:18.000 --> 2:36:30.000]  God of our ancestors and Lord of mercy, you have made all things and short lived lacking in comprehension of judgment and of laws.
[2:36:30.000 --> 2:36:41.000]  Indeed, though one might be perfect among mortals, if wisdom which comes from you be lacking, we count for nothing.
[2:36:41.000 --> 2:36:47.000]  The glum perp walk of the sour puss Democrats was worth the price of admission.
[2:36:47.000 --> 2:37:00.000]  We live in a challenging and tumultuous time, a quickly evolving ever more interconnected world, a rapidly changing economy that benefits too few while leaving too many behind.
[2:37:00.000 --> 2:37:09.000]  And as Obama and crew were officially relieved of duty, a sigh of relief hung over the beautiful for spacious skies.
[2:37:09.000 --> 2:37:11.000]  So help me God.
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:18.000]  Congratulations.
[2:37:18.000 --> 2:37:33.000]  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States
[2:37:33.000 --> 2:37:47.000]  and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:49.000]  So help me God.
[2:37:49.000 --> 2:38:01.000]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[2:38:01.000 --> 2:38:18.000]  The protesters, mad dogs with no rhyme or reason, flung the last throes of their mockingbird media brainwashed riddled minds from decades of gorging on a diet of delusion and fear into the cold streets of Washington, DC.
[2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:25.000]  You're out here protesting so people can see your protest, but why don't you want to talk when there's people here that are willing to cover it?
[2:38:25.000 --> 2:38:32.000]  However, Providence hung heavily in the air, and it is huge.
[2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:43.000]  The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.
[2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:51.000]  But that is the past, and now we are looking only to the future.
[2:38:51.000 --> 2:39:02.000]  In the words of Donald J. Trump,
[2:39:02.000 --> 2:39:13.000]  We are one nation and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams and their success will be our success.
[2:39:13.000 --> 2:39:21.000]  We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.
[2:39:21.000 --> 2:39:28.000]  The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.
[2:39:28.000 --> 2:39:44.000]  John Bound for Enforce.com
[2:39:44.000 --> 2:39:52.000]  What Trump is saying and doing, and what I saw Spicer just saying during the break, everything they're doing will destroy the globalist.
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:59.000]  There's no way they can't deliver because the message is the destination.
[2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:07.000]  When you expose unelected corporate world government that's tax exempt, running things that admits in its own internal annals that aren't secret.
[2:40:07.000 --> 2:40:09.000]  They're public. That's how arrogant they are.
[2:40:09.000 --> 2:40:13.000]  Imagine what's secret that they want to make us poor and hopeless.
[2:40:13.000 --> 2:40:19.000]  They want to sow division between people of different skin colors and religion, and it starts wars.
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:27.000]  And then put radical Islam in charge of everything, the most crazy oppressive people the world's ever seen, the most racist people the world's ever seen.
[2:40:27.000 --> 2:40:34.000]  It's crazy. And Trump's for real.
[2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:38.000]  And he's delivering like no one's ever seen. There's a new Kitt Daniels article.
[2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:40.000]  The guy at Kitt is getting so prolific.
[2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:43.000]  The guy writes like five articles a day and each one better than the next.
[2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:49.000]  Not satire. I was thinking this this morning. I didn't even say this to the kid. It's funny how our brains are synced sometimes.
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:56.000]  We're so immersed in this truth. I was like, it's like, it's not real. I feel like I'm being a cheerleader.
[2:40:56.000 --> 2:41:03.000]  And I love to go after the government. I love to attack people. I mean, you know, they're doing it, but it's like, I keep looking for something Trump's doing.
[2:41:03.000 --> 2:41:07.000]  And it's like he's overperforming. It's crazy.
[2:41:07.000 --> 2:41:14.000]  I mean, I was talking to people from Detroit and stuff, both black and white. They're like, yeah, they're announcing like eight more companies come back just because he got them to.
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:22.000]  I mean, you know, and then the unions attacking because he's bringing jobs back. I mean, because they're Democrats. I mean, it is, it is.
[2:41:22.000 --> 2:41:25.000]  It's like a suicide pack they've got.
[2:41:25.000 --> 2:41:30.000]  But here's the new Kitt Daniels article. Trump wrestles control from trilateral elite.
[2:41:30.000 --> 2:41:42.000]  What an astute statement because it's the trilateral commission that works with Japan that works with the United States and that works with Europe to agree to all the trade deals to consolidate corporate control.
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:45.000]  How about we don't consolidate? How about we have a boom?
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:50.000]  Only group allowed to have a boom for 30 years has been China and their people haven't got any of the money.
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:53.000]  I don't want to hear one more time that I don't like Chinese people.
[2:41:53.000 --> 2:41:58.000]  Well, you know, they don't like Chinese people's mouths. They tell you killed 84 million of them.
[2:41:58.000 --> 2:42:06.000]  And so this is so exciting. Obama's pro-slavery stance actually makes sense. That's in the TPP. It legalizes forced labor.
[2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:09.000]  I mean, seriously, can't make this up.
[2:42:09.000 --> 2:42:19.000]  Wasn't really a trade deal, but an all out rather an enabling act to allow transnational corporations to dump American workers and erode U.S. economic independence.
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:36.000]  This is all part of a program by the trilateral commission who groomed Obama to secretly seize control of the U.S. government from within and the sole intention of breaking down U.S. national sovereignty and economic might to make the way for the North American Union much like the EU.
[2:42:36.000 --> 2:42:38.000]  And now all of that is on fire.
[2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:43.000]  So now they've gone from denying world government exists saying world government was American.
[2:42:43.000 --> 2:42:45.000]  I've got a huge stack of news here just from today.
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:51.000]  World government was American and now American world power is collapsing. No, it's not. Everybody's gonna love us again.
[2:42:51.000 --> 2:42:55.000]  We never got any of the spoils of all this stolen stuff. The globalist did.
[2:42:55.000 --> 2:43:02.000]  Look at this. Will Trump be the end of Pax Americana? It was never a Pax Americana. It was global government. That whole neocon plan.
[2:43:02.000 --> 2:43:07.000]  Trump challenges world order, blah, blah, blah, on and on and on.
[2:43:07.000 --> 2:43:17.000]  So I got to tell you, his common sense approach is, is, is unrivaled. The fact that you spread the word, built the movement to defeat the globalist, and then now we're here is incredible.
[2:43:17.000 --> 2:43:29.000]  But the people that have been brainwashed and manipulated, notice the Republican establishments against him as well, they're all coming out against Trump and going into total hysteria.
[2:43:29.000 --> 2:43:40.000]  I got called an effing white male probably 300 times by exclusively white women. And then the black people I saw in the demonstrations just looked bewildered.
[2:43:40.000 --> 2:43:46.000]  They'd say, I like a lot of what you do, Alex. And why are you here with a Hitler? And I'm just telling you what I saw.
[2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:53.000]  And then the white men were just like zombies walk along behind the women who looked like they'd been like vampires and drunk all their blood or something.
[2:43:53.000 --> 2:43:59.000]  I mean, they look all shriveled like whether they were older, young, look retarded. I mean, I'm not being mean here. I felt sorry for him.
[2:43:59.000 --> 2:44:06.000]  But then Ashley Beckford, our great and Trump reporters, a lot of courage, we're going to make America great hat went downtown for the big March.
[2:44:06.000 --> 2:44:13.000]  And, and, and Leanne got triggered seeing them lying saying nobody showed up the Trump event, even though they admit 300,000 couldn't get in because they were blocking the interests.
[2:44:13.000 --> 2:44:17.000]  And it was still full. They just now the thing where you can't stand on the grass in certain areas.
[2:44:17.000 --> 2:44:23.000]  So there's like little areas where the cops say you get off that. In fact, there was all this grass area. I'm right there in the front. They go, you can't stand here.
[2:44:23.000 --> 2:44:29.000]  Well, somebody had already taken my chair. I didn't kick him out of it. So talking about all this, we've got a video coming up.
[2:44:29.000 --> 2:44:36.000]  We'll play of what happened to her. I wish we had enough camera people who have sent her with a camera person, but they were all in DC.
[2:44:36.000 --> 2:44:42.000]  I didn't even tell her to go out there. I wouldn't send a reporter, a female or male out to a hoard of folks by themselves. God knows what happened.
[2:44:42.000 --> 2:44:49.000]  But yeah, isn't it incredible though that you did a great job. So tell folks you guys take over and a Trump supporter.
[2:44:49.000 --> 2:44:52.000]  Yes, her voice wasn't welcome there. She didn't matter.
[2:44:52.000 --> 2:44:58.000]  Well, I said, I'm a woman. So let me go ahead and show my face at this woman's march. This is very important.
[2:44:58.000 --> 2:45:06.000]  You know, for women, they're talking about different aspects of women's rights. Or so I thought when I actually arrived there, I found out it was very, very disjointed.
[2:45:06.000 --> 2:45:12.000]  Basically, you had all these people coming out here. They don't even know what they're coming to even protest.
[2:45:12.000 --> 2:45:20.000]  They're basically out there just hating on men, hating on Donald Trump in particular is basically a Donald Trump and men's hate fest.
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:27.000]  They were literally had signs where they're hating on men's anatomy just by having male anatomy. You're automatically evil. You're automatically.
[2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:29.000]  So it's the ultimate sexism.
[2:45:29.000 --> 2:45:30.000]  Right. Exactly.
[2:45:30.000 --> 2:45:32.000]  I mean, it's like, I mean, exactly.
[2:45:32.000 --> 2:45:37.000]  Unless you identify as something that's non binary, then you're okay because you've already.
[2:45:37.000 --> 2:45:43.000]  And you just answered my question. What's the plan? You have to then say, I'm not male or female. I'm not white. I'm not black.
[2:45:43.000 --> 2:45:49.000]  They create such a race war that then you just say, I'll do whatever you say. I'm whatever new definition you say.
[2:45:49.000 --> 2:45:53.000]  Right. When I was out there, I actually met, of course, several androgynous people, trans people.
[2:45:53.000 --> 2:46:01.000]  And there was this guy out there who was saying he was androgynous and he was just reiterating to me how racist the LGBT community is.
[2:46:01.000 --> 2:46:03.000]  I actually should do a video on this because I have a lot of clips.
[2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:05.000]  Oh, I agree. I'm not against anybody.
[2:46:05.000 --> 2:46:06.000]  Right.
[2:46:06.000 --> 2:46:10.000]  And people naturally always been different ways. We welcome people that are truly diverse.
[2:46:10.000 --> 2:46:11.000]  Right.
[2:46:11.000 --> 2:46:12.000]  The point is they're force selling this.
[2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:13.000]  Right.
[2:46:13.000 --> 2:46:14.000]  Keep going.
[2:46:14.000 --> 2:46:17.000]  When you went to that Hillary Clinton rally and that white gay male felt like he could...
[2:46:17.000 --> 2:46:18.000]  Called you an Uncle Tom.
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:19.000]  He called me Uncle Tom.
[2:46:19.000 --> 2:46:21.000]  Good thing I wasn't there. I'm not bragging about a punch in the nose.
[2:46:21.000 --> 2:46:22.000]  Right. And then the...
[2:46:22.000 --> 2:46:24.000]  Like these guys gang up on you, these big guys.
[2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:28.000]  Exactly. Oh, yeah. And they threatened to, you know, basically physically attack me.
[2:46:28.000 --> 2:46:32.000]  And then they, you know, verbally attack me all the time.
[2:46:32.000 --> 2:46:35.000]  And basically this woman in the same video agrees with him.
[2:46:35.000 --> 2:46:39.000]  Look at how that guy has pictures of Hillary who funds radical jihadist enslaving women.
[2:46:39.000 --> 2:46:41.000]  All her pictures of Hillary all over him.
[2:46:41.000 --> 2:46:42.000]  What a conformist.
[2:46:42.000 --> 2:46:43.000]  Yeah. That's what I was saying.
[2:46:43.000 --> 2:46:46.000]  And then that's the gay woman who was saying her wife is black.
[2:46:46.000 --> 2:46:48.000]  So she's able to call me a racer.
[2:46:48.000 --> 2:46:50.000]  And then she wasn't black.
[2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:51.000]  Right.
[2:46:51.000 --> 2:46:52.000]  Well, yeah.
[2:46:52.000 --> 2:46:53.000]  That's another aspect.
[2:46:53.000 --> 2:46:58.000]  So that exposes her, yeah, she's allowed, she gets a pass to be a racist.
[2:46:58.000 --> 2:46:59.000]  Because she is...
[2:46:59.000 --> 2:47:00.000]  And they were so freaked out.
[2:47:00.000 --> 2:47:01.000]  They just...
[2:47:01.000 --> 2:47:02.000]  Right.
[2:47:02.000 --> 2:47:03.000]  Right.
[2:47:03.000 --> 2:47:04.000]  All they did was insult you. They didn't have any ideas.
[2:47:04.000 --> 2:47:07.000]  Yeah. I was shocked by actually how many people really showed up.
[2:47:07.000 --> 2:47:10.000]  And it was just like, they really had such a disjointed message.
[2:47:10.000 --> 2:47:12.000]  You couldn't figure out really what they were protesting about.
[2:47:12.000 --> 2:47:13.000]  Let's talk about yesterday.
[2:47:13.000 --> 2:47:14.000]  How long is the video you've got?
[2:47:14.000 --> 2:47:15.000]  Because I want to play it.
[2:47:15.000 --> 2:47:18.000]  Well, I think this cut is about five minutes.
[2:47:18.000 --> 2:47:20.000]  But I have hours and hours of footage.
[2:47:20.000 --> 2:47:24.000]  I've been out there for four hours and just basically having a monologue with myself.
[2:47:24.000 --> 2:47:25.000]  They won't talk to you.
[2:47:25.000 --> 2:47:26.000]  Right. They wouldn't talk to you.
[2:47:26.000 --> 2:47:28.000]  I've never seen it where...
[2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:32.000]  Because if you go to any other type of political event, people want to talk.
[2:47:32.000 --> 2:47:33.000]  They want to be on camera.
[2:47:33.000 --> 2:47:34.000]  They'll never talk.
[2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:36.000]  They just scream, you're a racist or you're a...
[2:47:36.000 --> 2:47:38.000]  They were so triggered by my Trump hat.
[2:47:38.000 --> 2:47:42.000]  I was saying in the video, I said, don't try to adjust your television screen.
[2:47:42.000 --> 2:47:44.000]  This is actually a black woman who supported Trump.
[2:47:44.000 --> 2:47:47.000]  I voted for him in the primary and the general election.
[2:47:47.000 --> 2:47:49.000]  I guess, you know, that makes me a bad person.
[2:47:49.000 --> 2:47:51.000]  I'm not with the group, you know.
[2:47:51.000 --> 2:47:52.000]  I'm not a woman.
[2:47:52.000 --> 2:47:54.000]  I'm not, you know, part of black lives matter.
[2:47:54.000 --> 2:48:00.000]  Your black life doesn't matter unless you're actually agreeing with their communist talking points, basically.
[2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:03.000]  Well, they're trying to brand it exactly that they own black people.
[2:48:03.000 --> 2:48:04.000]  Right.
[2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:05.000]  That's called slavery.
[2:48:05.000 --> 2:48:06.000]  And they own women.
[2:48:06.000 --> 2:48:08.000]  Because if you're for the women, you're for the march.
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:09.000]  It's complete mental slavery.
[2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:13.000]  You can't wear your Trump hat, but you're allowed to wear the hijab and meet up with Hamas.
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:14.000]  Yeah, what about all the...
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:17.000]  I saw these hijabs at women going, I'm for women's rights.
[2:48:17.000 --> 2:48:18.000]  I wear a hijab.
[2:48:18.000 --> 2:48:19.000]  That's the opposite.
[2:48:19.000 --> 2:48:22.000]  Is that not part of the patriarchy and male dominance?
[2:48:22.000 --> 2:48:23.000]  That's the ultimate form of it.
[2:48:23.000 --> 2:48:27.000]  And then on the other spectrum, you had all these naked women who were basically topless.
[2:48:27.000 --> 2:48:28.000]  This is in my video.
[2:48:28.000 --> 2:48:29.000]  Sorry.
[2:48:29.000 --> 2:48:34.000]  I know it's a family show, but they're all these people, these women, okay, it's going to be 210.
[2:48:34.000 --> 2:48:36.000]  They're saying the report's going to be about two minutes long.
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:39.000]  And basically, they're all these women just exposing themselves.
[2:48:39.000 --> 2:48:41.000]  And they were saying, this is my women's right.
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:44.000]  And I was saying, you know, to myself, guess what?
[2:48:44.000 --> 2:48:45.000]  You know what?
[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:47.000]  You wouldn't have these rights in these Islamic countries.
[2:48:47.000 --> 2:48:49.000]  You supported Hillary Clinton.
[2:48:49.000 --> 2:48:50.000]  You support Bernie Sanders.
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:51.000]  Exactly.
[2:48:51.000 --> 2:48:52.000]  You support the Communist takeover.
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:53.000]  Well, guess what?
[2:48:53.000 --> 2:48:54.000]  You're not going to have your women's rights.
[2:48:54.000 --> 2:48:58.000]  You're not going to have your rights to expose yourself because that's America.
[2:48:58.000 --> 2:49:00.000]  You see, that's called logic.
[2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:01.000]  But they would...
[2:49:01.000 --> 2:49:04.000]  I was saying the same thing.
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:07.000]  Only here in the West, you do that and I'm fine with it.
[2:49:07.000 --> 2:49:10.000]  But exactly, they wouldn't listen to logic.
[2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:11.000]  Right.
[2:49:11.000 --> 2:49:12.000]  Exactly.
[2:49:12.000 --> 2:49:13.000]  There's no logic.
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:16.000]  They're so oppressed that they can run around but make it.
[2:49:16.000 --> 2:49:17.000]  Right.
[2:49:17.000 --> 2:49:19.000]  They don't even want to hear my opinion.
[2:49:19.000 --> 2:49:20.000]  They don't even want to...
[2:49:20.000 --> 2:49:23.000]  Call you an affin' white male and beat you and call you racist names.
[2:49:23.000 --> 2:49:24.000]  No discourse whatsoever.
[2:49:24.000 --> 2:49:25.000]  Oh, yeah.
[2:49:25.000 --> 2:49:27.000]  The cops let them attack everybody, including women.
[2:49:27.000 --> 2:49:28.000]  Oh, yeah.
[2:49:28.000 --> 2:49:29.000]  Because they're liberal.
[2:49:29.000 --> 2:49:30.000]  It's okay.
[2:49:30.000 --> 2:49:31.000]  Exactly.
[2:49:31.000 --> 2:49:32.000]  How do you think...
[2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:34.000]  Well, chime in, whoever.
[2:49:34.000 --> 2:49:35.000]  How did we get to this point?
[2:49:35.000 --> 2:49:36.000]  Because I've got to be honest.
[2:49:36.000 --> 2:49:39.000]  I'm kind of stunned after I was in D.C.
[2:49:39.000 --> 2:49:40.000]  It was so crazy.
[2:49:40.000 --> 2:49:42.000]  It was like being in a giant cult.
[2:49:42.000 --> 2:49:44.000]  It was just the craziest thing I've ever seen.
[2:49:44.000 --> 2:49:50.000]  I've put a lot of the blame actually on our former, so glad to say that, former president,
[2:49:50.000 --> 2:49:51.000]  Barack Obama.
[2:49:51.000 --> 2:49:56.320]  You know, all this race-baiting and fomenting this kind of race-war idea really came out
[2:49:56.320 --> 2:49:58.000]  of his presidency.
[2:49:58.000 --> 2:50:02.400]  Obama came out like, hey, I'm the first black president when that's not even true for many,
[2:50:02.400 --> 2:50:03.600]  many reasons.
[2:50:03.600 --> 2:50:07.000]  And basically, it just spurred people to think, he's for me.
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:08.440]  He's my president.
[2:50:08.440 --> 2:50:12.720]  He's going to change everything and make everything good for the black community.
[2:50:12.720 --> 2:50:14.200]  And guess what? He did nothing.
[2:50:14.200 --> 2:50:16.840]  In fact, he increased the poverty rates.
[2:50:16.840 --> 2:50:17.840]  He increased the plight.
[2:50:17.840 --> 2:50:18.840]  Totally for granted.
[2:50:18.840 --> 2:50:23.240]  I know behind the scenes and it's public, Trump specifically wants to make a point
[2:50:23.240 --> 2:50:27.240]  is obsessed with bringing the best jobs to predominantly black areas.
[2:50:27.240 --> 2:50:28.800]  People could say, well, that's discriminatory.
[2:50:28.800 --> 2:50:29.800]  What is this form of action?
[2:50:29.800 --> 2:50:31.400]  No, that's people that want to work.
[2:50:31.400 --> 2:50:34.520]  And people are owed a debt after what the Democrats and everybody and the Republicans
[2:50:34.520 --> 2:50:35.520]  have done.
[2:50:35.520 --> 2:50:36.520]  We should bring a lot of jobs.
[2:50:36.520 --> 2:50:37.520]  And I'm skipping this break.
[2:50:37.520 --> 2:50:38.520]  Sorry.
[2:50:38.520 --> 2:50:39.520]  Glad to tell you.
[2:50:39.520 --> 2:50:40.520]  Yeah.
[2:50:40.520 --> 2:50:41.520]  I mean, this is just so incredible.
[2:50:41.520 --> 2:50:42.520]  Trump really loves everybody.
[2:50:42.520 --> 2:50:46.520]  Obama to their face and Hillary in the Clintons, to their face, these people in Detroit and
[2:50:46.520 --> 2:50:49.880]  elsewhere who've been begging for a little bit of help to say, you ain't new factories
[2:50:49.880 --> 2:50:50.880]  coming to Detroit.
[2:50:50.880 --> 2:50:52.600]  We're going to rebuild your city with Syrian refugees.
[2:50:52.600 --> 2:50:53.600]  Sorry, guys.
[2:50:53.600 --> 2:50:55.100]  I've been to Detroit.
[2:50:55.100 --> 2:50:59.720]  It's really a wasteland, especially several years ago, 10 years ago when I went there.
[2:50:59.720 --> 2:51:03.880]  And the whole thing is, you know, Obama did nothing for these people and they refused
[2:51:03.880 --> 2:51:05.280]  to listen to Trump.
[2:51:05.280 --> 2:51:12.040]  When he and, you know, Ben Carson, he made him the director of the secretary of HUD.
[2:51:12.040 --> 2:51:16.360]  And the bottom line is this, people like me and Ben Carson, we supported Trump because
[2:51:16.360 --> 2:51:21.080]  we want to increase the wealth of the black community.
[2:51:21.080 --> 2:51:26.680]  And for them to say, like Mark Lamont Hill, we're mediocre Negroes, really, Ben Carson
[2:51:26.680 --> 2:51:27.680]  is a mediocre Negro.
[2:51:27.680 --> 2:51:28.680]  Right.
[2:51:28.680 --> 2:51:29.680]  That's ridiculous.
[2:51:29.680 --> 2:51:34.400]  Well, yeah, like speaking racially of a group, you gotta agree with me or you're not a person.
[2:51:34.400 --> 2:51:35.400]  Exactly.
[2:51:35.400 --> 2:51:39.080]  He is a multi-millionaire neurosurgeon, didn't he actually win like a Nobel Prize or something?
[2:51:39.080 --> 2:51:40.080]  Yeah.
[2:51:40.080 --> 2:51:41.080]  You know what mediocre means?
[2:51:41.080 --> 2:51:42.080]  It means subhuman.
[2:51:42.080 --> 2:51:43.080]  It means like you're not.
[2:51:43.080 --> 2:51:48.320]  Meanwhile, Mark Lamont Hill is like totally privileged and is, I mean, but he speaks on
[2:51:48.320 --> 2:51:49.320]  behalf of the black community.
[2:51:49.320 --> 2:51:50.320]  Let's play a clip of that.
[2:51:50.320 --> 2:51:52.440]  I've got, I've got a clip here.
[2:51:52.440 --> 2:51:53.440]  We've got a bunch of these.
[2:51:53.440 --> 2:51:56.240]  Madonna says blowing up the White House speaking at Women's March.
[2:51:56.240 --> 2:51:57.640]  I want to play that because I mentioned it.
[2:51:57.640 --> 2:52:04.920]  And then I've also got a clip here of CNN host saying that Trump is a basically Hitler,
[2:52:04.920 --> 2:52:05.920]  Van Jones.
[2:52:05.920 --> 2:52:08.080]  So let's go ahead and play that first clip of Madonna.
[2:52:08.080 --> 2:52:09.080]  Here we go.
[2:52:09.080 --> 2:52:10.080]  Lock her up.
[2:52:10.080 --> 2:52:11.080]  Yes.
[2:52:11.080 --> 2:52:12.080]  Yes.
[2:52:12.080 --> 2:52:13.080]  I'm angry.
[2:52:13.080 --> 2:52:14.080]  Yes.
[2:52:14.080 --> 2:52:15.080]  I've made billions.
[2:52:15.080 --> 2:52:16.080]  I am outraged.
[2:52:16.080 --> 2:52:18.760]  I'm so oppressed as a woman in the West.
[2:52:18.760 --> 2:52:19.760]  Yes.
[2:52:19.760 --> 2:52:20.760]  I'm so angry.
[2:52:20.760 --> 2:52:21.760]  I gotta read my notes.
[2:52:21.760 --> 2:52:22.760]  I have thought an awful lot.
[2:52:22.760 --> 2:52:23.760]  I have thought an awful lot.
[2:52:23.760 --> 2:52:24.760]  A jib.
[2:52:24.760 --> 2:52:25.760]  About blowing up the White House.
[2:52:25.760 --> 2:52:26.760]  Lock her up.
[2:52:26.760 --> 2:52:27.760]  Lock her up.
[2:52:27.760 --> 2:52:28.760]  She's so...
[2:52:28.760 --> 2:52:29.760]  But I know...
[2:52:29.760 --> 2:52:30.760]  Look, even her friends next to her said, what?
[2:52:30.760 --> 2:52:34.000]  That this won't change anything.
[2:52:34.000 --> 2:52:36.660]  We cannot fall into despair.
[2:52:36.660 --> 2:52:38.160]  I love this arrogant devil worshipper.
[2:52:38.160 --> 2:52:39.160]  She's well known.
[2:52:39.160 --> 2:52:41.920]  That's a very selfish person.
[2:52:41.920 --> 2:52:46.360]  Hasn't she damaged women enough with her music and her disgusting behavior?
[2:52:46.360 --> 2:52:47.360]  She's a pig.
[2:52:47.360 --> 2:52:48.360]  We must love one another.
[2:52:48.360 --> 2:52:49.360]  I'm gonna be honest.
[2:52:49.360 --> 2:52:50.360]  I don't want to sit here.
[2:52:50.360 --> 2:52:52.280]  They go, you effing white males the problem.
[2:52:52.280 --> 2:52:54.200]  I'm sure we got problems.
[2:52:54.200 --> 2:52:55.720]  I was there, okay, for three days.
[2:52:55.720 --> 2:52:58.960]  I gotta say, the nastiest stuff was weird white women.
[2:52:58.960 --> 2:53:00.200]  I'm not bashing white women.
[2:53:00.200 --> 2:53:04.320]  I'm just saying whatever programming they did to them, like whatever guilt they had,
[2:53:04.320 --> 2:53:08.520]  that made them more like go with whatever they were told, they were just like crazy.
[2:53:08.520 --> 2:53:12.680]  And they were just like frothing and spitting and attacking and just running around, foaming
[2:53:12.680 --> 2:53:15.680]  at the mouth.
[2:53:15.680 --> 2:53:16.680]  What have they done to them?
[2:53:16.680 --> 2:53:17.680]  I have no idea.
[2:53:17.680 --> 2:53:19.480]  It's very delusional.
[2:53:19.480 --> 2:53:22.360]  They're very delusional and living in an alternative reality.
[2:53:22.360 --> 2:53:28.240]  It's like these fat white gay guys walking over to a beautiful black woman and saying,
[2:53:28.240 --> 2:53:31.520]  you're an uncle, Tom, you're an idiot, like getting in your space.
[2:53:31.520 --> 2:53:32.520]  Or yeah.
[2:53:32.520 --> 2:53:33.520]  And that made you cry.
[2:53:33.520 --> 2:53:37.400]  Something else with those signs that I read out there was that one of the signs was like,
[2:53:37.400 --> 2:53:40.960]  I'm marching for all the women who voted against their own best interests.
[2:53:40.960 --> 2:53:45.720]  It's like, no, a lot of women voted for Donald Trump because we don't think that the most
[2:53:45.720 --> 2:53:49.040]  important thing is just the rights to an abortion.
[2:53:49.040 --> 2:53:50.040]  There's a lot of-
[2:53:50.040 --> 2:53:55.360]  He's gotten awards for putting more women in executive positions, gays, minorities, but
[2:53:55.360 --> 2:53:56.360]  he doesn't care.
[2:53:56.360 --> 2:53:57.960]  If you'll get the job done, you got the job.
[2:53:57.960 --> 2:53:58.960]  Right.
[2:53:58.960 --> 2:53:59.960]  But they think that's-
[2:53:59.960 --> 2:54:01.840]  I remember I looked at an interview, he goes, I don't know why most of my casinos are managed
[2:54:01.840 --> 2:54:02.840]  by gay men.
[2:54:02.840 --> 2:54:03.840]  They just seem to do the best job.
[2:54:03.840 --> 2:54:06.720]  It's like kind of like saying in the NFL, why is it mainly black males?
[2:54:06.720 --> 2:54:09.800]  It's like, for some reason, in certain niches, people start to be better at stuff.
[2:54:09.800 --> 2:54:10.800]  Maybe if we were more-
[2:54:10.800 --> 2:54:11.800]  It's like, oh, he's anti-gay.
[2:54:11.800 --> 2:54:16.600]  Maybe if we were more prosperous and we had money and jobs and we wouldn't have to prolong
[2:54:16.600 --> 2:54:17.600]  having a family.
[2:54:17.600 --> 2:54:20.560]  We wouldn't have been indoctrinated that you can only have one-
[2:54:20.560 --> 2:54:23.120]  But of course we need women to be able to be in the workforce.
[2:54:23.120 --> 2:54:25.240]  But it's the West that allowed that to happen.
[2:54:25.240 --> 2:54:26.240]  Yeah.
[2:54:26.240 --> 2:54:27.240]  Right.
[2:54:27.240 --> 2:54:30.640]  And that's what it was all about, was about abortion rights, so-called abortion rights.
[2:54:30.640 --> 2:54:31.880]  Which really means kill all of them on the list.
[2:54:31.880 --> 2:54:32.880]  Right.
[2:54:32.880 --> 2:54:35.360]  And then they want to talk about Margaret Stanger, Planned Parenthood.
[2:54:35.360 --> 2:54:39.440]  And I also want to do a video on that, to let everybody know the true history of Planned
[2:54:39.440 --> 2:54:44.120]  Parenthood, Margaret Stanger, total racist, total person who-
[2:54:44.120 --> 2:54:46.760]  She said you were a weed that should die before you're born.
[2:54:46.760 --> 2:54:47.760]  Right, exactly.
[2:54:47.760 --> 2:54:49.760]  She said we have to- we can't let it go out.
[2:54:49.760 --> 2:54:51.760]  And Ms. Begford, you don't look like a weed to me.
[2:54:51.760 --> 2:54:53.680]  This is Leanne or anybody right there.
[2:54:53.680 --> 2:54:54.680]  Yeah.
[2:54:54.680 --> 2:54:56.520]  We definitely don't need to exterminate the black community.
[2:54:56.520 --> 2:54:57.520]  That's for sure.
[2:54:57.520 --> 2:54:58.520]  And that's what Planned Parenthood is about.
[2:54:58.520 --> 2:54:59.520]  Well, for me, that's the litmus test.
[2:54:59.520 --> 2:55:04.920]  If you are all foaming at the mouth about, let's admit what was founded by basically,
[2:55:04.920 --> 2:55:08.160]  Margaret Stanger was basically as the captain of the KKK.
[2:55:08.160 --> 2:55:11.920]  So and I'm sorry, I get women and kids and things happen, you're worried you've been
[2:55:11.920 --> 2:55:15.200]  raped or might be deformed, that's a medical procedure.
[2:55:15.200 --> 2:55:18.040]  You know, for the safety of the woman, let's just be honest, but the thing is, we don't
[2:55:18.040 --> 2:55:19.880]  have to worship killing the babies.
[2:55:19.880 --> 2:55:21.640]  I'm not judging anybody side of abortion.
[2:55:21.640 --> 2:55:24.720]  I've been honest, I've paid for them in my time and okay, I'm sad for it.
[2:55:24.720 --> 2:55:29.160]  The point is, is that it doesn't have to be some national worship fest for it.
[2:55:29.160 --> 2:55:33.320]  And you don't have to blame women who voted for Donald Trump saying that we voted against
[2:55:33.320 --> 2:55:38.600]  our best interests as if jobs and the economy and being able to feed our families or have
[2:55:38.600 --> 2:55:39.600]  a future.
[2:55:39.600 --> 2:55:44.120]  I mean, as if there's a deal, they weren't trying to put women in jobs of power to empower
[2:55:44.120 --> 2:55:45.120]  women.
[2:55:45.120 --> 2:55:47.640]  Their own white paper state was to end the family and enslave everybody.
[2:55:47.640 --> 2:55:51.560]  And quite frankly, they said women in the psychological actuaries would serve tyranny
[2:55:51.560 --> 2:55:55.080]  better than men, not that men won't serve tyranny, but on average, a certain percentage
[2:55:55.080 --> 2:55:58.040]  of men will rebel and lead a revolt.
[2:55:58.040 --> 2:56:02.040]  So they actuated all out with studies and said, we're going to put women in charge,
[2:56:02.040 --> 2:56:06.520]  but only in charge of their own destruction because who'll believe mama is bringing death
[2:56:06.520 --> 2:56:07.520]  to the family?
[2:56:07.520 --> 2:56:09.560]  Well, you wouldn't saw those women at that march.
[2:56:09.560 --> 2:56:11.560]  You saw people are ready to bring the death.
[2:56:11.560 --> 2:56:12.560]  Exactly.
[2:56:12.560 --> 2:56:16.640]  They made women believe that they don't need men in order to survive and in order to, you
[2:56:16.640 --> 2:56:18.120]  know, and we need you to survive.
[2:56:18.120 --> 2:56:19.120]  Exactly.
[2:56:19.120 --> 2:56:20.120]  That's how we keep the species going.
[2:56:20.120 --> 2:56:21.120]  The chaotic relations.
[2:56:21.120 --> 2:56:22.120]  We're one species.
[2:56:22.120 --> 2:56:23.120]  They don't seem to understand that.
[2:56:23.120 --> 2:56:25.320]  They don't seem to understand basic biology.
[2:56:25.320 --> 2:56:27.320]  If space aliens arrived, they would do this plan.
[2:56:27.320 --> 2:56:30.480]  I don't get into aliens and all this stuff, but I look at the plan and I go, this looks
[2:56:30.480 --> 2:56:31.920]  like some stuff some green men did.
[2:56:31.920 --> 2:56:32.920]  I mean, this doesn't look normal.
[2:56:32.920 --> 2:56:36.480]  Well, now they're trying to convince with National Geographic and others that even just
[2:56:36.480 --> 2:56:37.480]  your average woman.
[2:56:37.480 --> 2:56:38.480]  Yeah, let's show that again.
[2:56:38.480 --> 2:56:40.600]  A woman doesn't even deserve to be on the cover.
[2:56:40.600 --> 2:56:41.600]  Yeah.
[2:56:41.600 --> 2:56:43.600]  Because that, that would hurt if you're just a woman.
[2:56:43.600 --> 2:56:44.600]  It wouldn't have.
[2:56:44.600 --> 2:56:45.800]  You know, just a woman.
[2:56:45.800 --> 2:56:49.960]  If they were just trying to show the gender revolution and they had only gender binary
[2:56:49.960 --> 2:56:53.320]  trans woman, trans man, trans is fine.
[2:56:53.320 --> 2:56:54.320]  Okay, fine.
[2:56:54.320 --> 2:56:59.560]  But they made a point to put a male alongside all these other different genders.
[2:56:59.560 --> 2:57:03.000]  So why not put female, just explain male?
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:04.560]  No, because who are they?
[2:57:04.560 --> 2:57:07.080]  Who have I said, Lee, and you've been here five years, you're doing a great job, four
[2:57:07.080 --> 2:57:08.080]  and a half years.
[2:57:08.080 --> 2:57:09.080]  What do I harp on?
[2:57:09.080 --> 2:57:10.080]  Who are they targeting?
[2:57:10.080 --> 2:57:11.080]  They claim that your best friend is a woman.
[2:57:11.080 --> 2:57:12.080]  Who do you target?
[2:57:12.080 --> 2:57:13.080]  You bring people down.
[2:57:13.080 --> 2:57:14.080]  Who are they targeting?
[2:57:14.080 --> 2:57:15.080]  Or targeting women?
[2:57:15.080 --> 2:57:16.080]  Women, families.
[2:57:16.080 --> 2:57:18.280]  Because no, no, no, here's the deal.
[2:57:18.280 --> 2:57:23.760]  In embryonic development, the genetics, the, the, the, basically the genetics, the woman
[2:57:23.760 --> 2:57:26.560]  decides what, what is going to be male or female.
[2:57:26.560 --> 2:57:27.560]  Right.
[2:57:27.560 --> 2:57:28.560]  Right.
[2:57:28.560 --> 2:57:30.640]  Because all males were formerly a female.
[2:57:30.640 --> 2:57:31.640]  That's why we've got a breast.
[2:57:31.640 --> 2:57:32.640]  Right.
[2:57:32.640 --> 2:57:33.640]  And then you get washed in testosterone.
[2:57:33.640 --> 2:57:35.840]  The point is, is once they take, women are the species.
[2:57:35.840 --> 2:57:36.840]  Right.
[2:57:36.840 --> 2:57:38.960]  Because the big joke is humanity is woman.
[2:57:38.960 --> 2:57:39.960]  Right.
[2:57:39.960 --> 2:57:43.800]  So the big joke is they're literally telling you they, they, oh, we care about you.
[2:57:43.800 --> 2:57:44.800]  We represent you.
[2:57:44.800 --> 2:57:45.800]  They want to kill you.
[2:57:45.800 --> 2:57:46.800]  Right.
[2:57:46.800 --> 2:57:47.800]  Right.
[2:57:47.800 --> 2:57:48.800]  You understand that?
[2:57:48.800 --> 2:57:52.280]  That's why scientists are figuring out how to create life without a woman altogether.
[2:57:52.280 --> 2:57:56.280]  They're using like a stem cells from a leg or just a random kind of.
[2:57:56.280 --> 2:57:57.280]  Oh, really?
[2:57:57.280 --> 2:57:58.880]  They're going to splice like five men together?
[2:57:58.880 --> 2:57:59.880]  Yes.
[2:57:59.880 --> 2:58:00.880]  Okay.
[2:58:00.880 --> 2:58:01.880]  Because I've heard with the women.
[2:58:01.880 --> 2:58:02.880]  The woman has the mitochondrial DNA.
[2:58:02.880 --> 2:58:03.880]  The woman has the mitochondrial DNA.
[2:58:03.880 --> 2:58:04.880]  Two eggs and create a girl.
[2:58:04.880 --> 2:58:07.000]  Well, if you're a lesbian, it's cool.
[2:58:07.000 --> 2:58:08.000]  This is only from a woman.
[2:58:08.000 --> 2:58:09.000]  See how weird this is?
[2:58:09.000 --> 2:58:10.000]  Right.
[2:58:10.000 --> 2:58:11.000]  But it's deeper than that.
[2:58:11.000 --> 2:58:12.000]  They're just, that's just pop selling it.
[2:58:12.000 --> 2:58:13.000]  We're going to break when we come back.
[2:58:13.000 --> 2:58:15.120]  Here's the big secret.
[2:58:15.120 --> 2:58:20.080]  Women only carry the mitochondrial DNA that's the entire race consciousness of a species.
[2:58:20.080 --> 2:58:24.000]  So if you don't have the mitochondrial DNA, then it's not really a human.
[2:58:24.000 --> 2:58:28.040]  It's just some weird clone splice creature.
[2:58:28.040 --> 2:58:29.040]  So here's the deal.
[2:58:29.040 --> 2:58:34.600]  They're cutting off the entire race memory and the fact that the mitochondrial DNA,
[2:58:34.600 --> 2:58:35.600]  only women have it.
[2:58:35.600 --> 2:58:40.040]  Women have a second set of DNA and it overrides the other and decides what DNA is manifested.
[2:58:40.040 --> 2:58:42.320]  And again, I'm going to tell you, kiss women's ass.
[2:58:42.320 --> 2:58:43.320]  It's the truth.
[2:58:43.320 --> 2:58:46.280]  It's like Hitler said, first you get the women, then you got the children.
[2:58:46.280 --> 2:58:47.440]  So follow the men.
[2:58:47.440 --> 2:58:49.680]  It's an attack on the species.
[2:58:49.680 --> 2:58:51.480]  Human experiment.

[3:00:07.240 --> 3:00:12.680]  I'm going to punch out and they'll get the broadcast going for the night.
[3:00:12.680 --> 3:00:26.440]  We're not just saying we're the front lines of the info war.
[3:00:26.440 --> 3:00:27.440]  Sometimes I wish we weren't.
[3:00:27.440 --> 3:00:30.680]  Let me tell you, because I have all this responsibility.
[3:00:30.680 --> 3:00:31.680]  I know how right we are.
[3:00:31.680 --> 3:00:33.280]  I know how evil the globalist are.
[3:00:33.280 --> 3:00:36.720]  And I just hope listeners understand this is real.
[3:00:36.720 --> 3:00:40.640]  Ashley Beckford, Leigh Ann McAddy, this is a short segment.
[3:00:40.640 --> 3:00:44.840]  You know it would be really nice if you didn't skip all those breaks and not plug one time
[3:00:44.840 --> 3:00:45.840]  the last hour.
[3:00:45.840 --> 3:00:48.200]  Maybe we could fund the Washington bureau.
[3:00:48.200 --> 3:00:52.440]  Maybe we could actually pay everybody around here.
[3:00:52.440 --> 3:00:54.440]  And that's right.
[3:00:54.440 --> 3:01:00.560]  The free shipping on some things, 30, 40% off storeable food, 30% off on nutraceuticals.
[3:01:00.560 --> 3:01:01.560]  It all ends today.
[3:01:01.560 --> 3:01:02.560]  It has to end today.
[3:01:02.560 --> 3:01:06.840]  infowarstore.com or call toll free, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three,
[3:01:06.840 --> 3:01:07.840]  nine.
[3:01:07.840 --> 3:01:08.840]  But I shouldn't have to belabor it.
[3:01:08.840 --> 3:01:10.680]  All great products everybody needs.
[3:01:10.680 --> 3:01:11.680]  Thank you for what you've done.
[3:01:11.680 --> 3:01:12.920]  Please continue to support us.
[3:01:12.920 --> 3:01:15.400]  DNA forces back 10% off.
[3:01:15.400 --> 3:01:17.520]  This is a short segment.
[3:01:17.520 --> 3:01:21.400]  Ashley, you were saying, you know, we've got to not be politically correct.
[3:01:21.400 --> 3:01:22.400]  Let's just admit it.
[3:01:22.400 --> 3:01:23.720]  Say what you said during the break.
[3:01:23.720 --> 3:01:29.040]  Well, I was saying that it's very controversial of a statement, but the bottom line is this.
[3:01:29.040 --> 3:01:37.320]  I believe that the LGBT movement and community is basically creating this whole sort of situation
[3:01:37.320 --> 3:01:40.080]  where we're going to actually become depopulated.
[3:01:40.080 --> 3:01:41.240]  We're depopulating the earth.
[3:01:41.240 --> 3:01:45.160]  We know the birth rates have been lowered and it's a system they've been used as a pawn
[3:01:45.160 --> 3:01:46.160]  in that.
[3:01:46.160 --> 3:01:47.160]  Right.
[3:01:47.160 --> 3:01:48.160]  Yeah.
[3:01:48.160 --> 3:01:49.160]  Yeah.
[3:01:49.160 --> 3:01:50.160]  Right.
[3:01:50.160 --> 3:01:52.000]  I don't think the individual LGBT community member is aware of this, but the bottom line
[3:01:52.000 --> 3:01:57.480]  is that it's a systematic way of depopulating the earth of limiting human population.
[3:01:57.480 --> 3:02:00.760]  We know Bill Gates, he wants that population to go to zero.
[3:02:00.760 --> 3:02:03.040]  So that's part of it is the LGBT agenda.
[3:02:03.040 --> 3:02:04.040]  Yeah.
[3:02:04.040 --> 3:02:09.200]  The owner of Facebook that says we're dumb-effors is basically buying Kauai, kicking the natives
[3:02:09.200 --> 3:02:10.200]  off their property.
[3:02:10.200 --> 3:02:11.200]  He doesn't want anybody around.
[3:02:11.200 --> 3:02:12.200]  Yeah.
[3:02:12.200 --> 3:02:13.720]  What can you have 100 different genders on Facebook?
[3:02:13.720 --> 3:02:14.720]  I thought there were two.
[3:02:14.720 --> 3:02:15.720]  Apparently there's 100.
[3:02:15.720 --> 3:02:18.440]  No, the science is not settled on that.
[3:02:18.440 --> 3:02:19.440]  Right.
[3:02:19.440 --> 3:02:20.440]  Apparently.
[3:02:20.440 --> 3:02:24.160]  Well, as soon as men and women realize we're under attack, it's not about being inclusive
[3:02:24.160 --> 3:02:25.160]  of other people.
[3:02:25.160 --> 3:02:26.160]  That's ridiculous.
[3:02:26.160 --> 3:02:27.160]  I don't.
[3:02:27.160 --> 3:02:28.160]  Exactly.
[3:02:28.160 --> 3:02:29.160]  I don't attack anybody.
[3:02:29.160 --> 3:02:31.160]  The fact is, is they tell the kids, no, you can't be male or female, you got to be
[3:02:31.160 --> 3:02:32.160]  something else now.
[3:02:32.160 --> 3:02:37.400]  I was surprised at how nasty people in the LGBT community can be 58 gender options for
[3:02:37.400 --> 3:02:38.400]  Facebook users.
[3:02:38.400 --> 3:02:39.400]  Well, that was from 2014.
[3:02:39.400 --> 3:02:40.400]  Okay.
[3:02:40.400 --> 3:02:41.400]  Yeah.
[3:02:41.400 --> 3:02:42.400]  There's more now.
[3:02:42.400 --> 3:02:43.400]  It's over 100 now.
[3:02:43.400 --> 3:02:44.400]  Yeah.
[3:02:44.400 --> 3:02:45.400]  They're doubling and tripling, I'm sure.
[3:02:45.400 --> 3:02:46.400]  They don't teach the kids math or history.
[3:02:46.400 --> 3:02:47.920]  It's all just all this new stuff.
[3:02:47.920 --> 3:02:48.920]  Right.
[3:02:48.920 --> 3:02:50.240]  No, that's completely it.
[3:02:50.240 --> 3:02:52.520]  And you wonder why the world is going mad.
[3:02:52.520 --> 3:02:57.520]  And they sell the idea that they can teach our kids, I mean, I don't tell my kids to
[3:02:57.520 --> 3:02:59.440]  like 10 or 11 about sex and stuff.
[3:02:59.440 --> 3:03:01.840]  They want to teach a kindergartner about all this stuff.
[3:03:01.840 --> 3:03:02.840]  That's called pedophilia.
[3:03:02.840 --> 3:03:03.840]  Right.
[3:03:03.840 --> 3:03:06.040]  Well, and it's like they're teaching them an alternative version of reality.
[3:03:06.040 --> 3:03:08.560]  So no wonder everyone is going insane.
[3:03:08.560 --> 3:03:12.440]  They're grooming them for abuse, either to abuse themselves or to be abused by other
[3:03:12.440 --> 3:03:13.440]  people.
[3:03:13.440 --> 3:03:14.440]  You're right.
[3:03:14.440 --> 3:03:15.440]  You just said it.
[3:03:15.440 --> 3:03:16.440]  Leanne made this point.
[3:03:16.440 --> 3:03:17.440]  Like she feels crazy being around this now.
[3:03:17.440 --> 3:03:21.840]  And when I was in D.C., after like hours of these crowds, like screaming, I was a racist
[3:03:21.840 --> 3:03:25.880]  and I knew I wasn't and I'm evil because I'm white and that's pure racism and all this
[3:03:25.880 --> 3:03:28.360]  other crap, I was feeling crazy.
[3:03:28.360 --> 3:03:29.360]  I had to go in.
[3:03:29.360 --> 3:03:30.960]  I just said, guys, we can't do this anymore.
[3:03:30.960 --> 3:03:34.320]  I was like, their insanity is like, it's right.
[3:03:34.320 --> 3:03:39.080]  And just the fact that their version of reality is being reinforced on CNN and things like
[3:03:39.080 --> 3:03:43.920]  that where you can, you're, it's, you literally want to go insane because you know that those
[3:03:43.920 --> 3:03:45.420]  pictures are fake.
[3:03:45.420 --> 3:03:46.420]  But they're putting it out.
[3:03:46.420 --> 3:03:47.420]  They admit it to be fake.
[3:03:47.420 --> 3:03:52.000]  I was there and saw the whole mall full of record numbers and they said no one was there
[3:03:52.000 --> 3:03:54.840]  and they show a fake photo and they don't get in trouble.
[3:03:54.840 --> 3:03:56.800]  Then they bitch at the president for calling it out.
[3:03:56.800 --> 3:03:57.800]  Right.
[3:03:57.800 --> 3:04:00.680]  And that's, I mean, and this is just one particular story.
[3:04:00.680 --> 3:04:04.760]  Think of all the other stories out there with these hashtag alternative facts because that's
[3:04:04.760 --> 3:04:05.960]  the other thing they've started now.
[3:04:05.960 --> 3:04:07.200]  It's not fake news.
[3:04:07.200 --> 3:04:11.120]  It's alternative facts that they're trying to say that Trump is bringing in the alternative.
[3:04:11.120 --> 3:04:12.120]  Right.
[3:04:12.120 --> 3:04:16.280]  They said that he removed the bust of Martin Luther King, Jr., which is a total lie.
[3:04:16.280 --> 3:04:17.280]  It was behind a curtain.
[3:04:17.280 --> 3:04:18.280]  Yeah.
[3:04:18.280 --> 3:04:21.760]  It was behind a secret surface agent or a door or something.
[3:04:21.760 --> 3:04:22.920]  Someone was standing there.
[3:04:22.920 --> 3:04:27.640]  And so they tried to say, they tweeted about this, one of these mainstream media fake news
[3:04:27.640 --> 3:04:32.680]  reporters went ahead and said that Trump is actually against Martin Luther King and removed
[3:04:32.680 --> 3:04:34.200]  his bust from the Oval Office.
[3:04:34.200 --> 3:04:35.200]  Ridiculous.
[3:04:35.200 --> 3:04:36.680]  That's an alternative fact right there.
[3:04:36.680 --> 3:04:37.680]  Exactly.
[3:04:37.680 --> 3:04:38.680]  Yeah.
[3:04:38.680 --> 3:04:41.080]  What he did was he added Winston Churchill back into the Oval Office.
[3:04:41.080 --> 3:04:42.080]  Thank you, Trump.
[3:04:42.080 --> 3:04:43.080]  Which they didn't want.
[3:04:43.080 --> 3:04:44.080]  Yeah.
[3:04:44.080 --> 3:04:48.840]  Well, and that was that whole message of who fought Hitler and who fought the jihadis,
[3:04:48.840 --> 3:04:49.840]  Winston Churchill.
[3:04:49.840 --> 3:04:50.840]  That was a message.
[3:04:50.840 --> 3:04:51.840]  I might tell you, these people are sick.
[3:04:51.840 --> 3:04:52.840]  Are true allies.
[3:04:52.840 --> 3:04:57.320]  I mean, anybody that allies themselves with the jihadis, I mean, we'll be right back.
[3:04:57.320 --> 3:05:26.440]  We got the key report from out there on the ground.
[3:05:26.440 --> 3:05:31.080]  You need to know your douchebag sense of entitlement is so palpable that it makes you the ugliest
[3:05:31.080 --> 3:05:32.080]  person in the room.
[3:05:32.080 --> 3:05:37.280]  And if you don't come off your self-made soapbox now, you will soon be the most lonely, desperate,
[3:05:37.280 --> 3:05:38.720]  desolate people on earth.
[3:05:38.720 --> 3:05:40.160]  Donald Trump is your president.
[3:05:40.160 --> 3:05:45.160]  The reality is Donald Trump is the president, America elected him, and we're here to make
[3:05:45.160 --> 3:05:46.760]  America great again.
[3:05:46.760 --> 3:05:51.200]  Make planet earth great again, expose the fake news media and change the world.
[3:05:51.200 --> 3:05:55.000]  You can either join us or be a humorous footnote in world history.

[3:05:58.080 --> 3:06:00.480]  Donald Trump is our president, now let's get to work.
[3:06:00.480 --> 3:06:05.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here on the road with a very important announcement.

[3:20:09.480 --> 3:20:10.480]  blood sugar levels,
[3:20:10.480 --> 3:20:12.480]  and had a sense of well-being overall?

[3:23:32.480 --> 3:23:38.480]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.

[3:24:16.480 --> 3:24:22.480]  Owen Troyer now sitting in for Alex Jones. Still with me is Ashley Beckford and Leanne McAdoo.
[3:24:22.480 --> 3:24:29.480]  And we've got news to cover. We're going to talk about all of the executive orders that were signed today by Donald Trump.
[3:24:29.480 --> 3:24:34.480]  Really unbelievable stuff. I can't even believe that this is happening. Kind of like Alex was referencing Kid Daniels earlier.
[3:24:34.480 --> 3:24:39.480]  Ashley and I are going to discuss our experience. You've seen our videos on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[3:24:39.480 --> 3:24:45.480]  Basically, first person in the street with the camera confronting these protesters, figure out what they're on the streets for.
[3:24:45.480 --> 3:24:49.480]  And then what we find out as well, really, they don't even know. They're just hearsay mafia.
[3:24:49.480 --> 3:24:56.480]  But before we get to that, if you like those videos, if you like the fact that we can send Ashley out, myself out, be live for 14 hours,

[3:25:58.480 --> 3:26:03.480]  Alright guys, now this is a video that is surfacing on Twitter.
[3:26:03.480 --> 3:26:10.480]  And I don't know, did you guys hear the radio hot topic I did today? Well, I basically thanked all the amazing people that I've met over the trip.
[3:26:10.480 --> 3:26:13.480]  Some of you I've reached out and talked to today. Just so many great people.
[3:26:13.480 --> 3:26:18.480]  And I also experienced obviously a lot of people that weren't so great.
[3:26:18.480 --> 3:26:25.480]  And it's funny that this video surfaces of this woman on an airplane. She ends up getting kicked off.
[3:26:25.480 --> 3:26:30.480]  We're going to play that. But there was a woman. I thought it was the same woman that I saw on an airplane.
[3:26:30.480 --> 3:26:35.480]  And she looks exactly like that. All of these people look the same.
[3:26:35.480 --> 3:26:44.480]  And I'm not kidding you. The quote I have is your douchebag entitlement is what it is.
[3:26:44.480 --> 3:26:49.480]  These people have a douchebag entitlement. And I witnessed it and that's what motivated me to say that in the hot topic.
[3:26:49.480 --> 3:26:55.480]  So let's play this video real quick. This woman is sitting next to a Trump supporter and she's fully triggered.
[3:26:55.480 --> 3:27:00.480]  He's just minding his own business too, by the way. She's the one that engaged in conversation with him.
[3:27:00.480 --> 3:27:04.480]  Wow. And so he smartly whips out his phone, records the whole thing. She gets kicked off the plane.
[3:27:04.480 --> 3:27:09.480]  Welcome to Trump's America, Snowflake. Let's go ahead and play this video. You guys got it ready?
[3:27:09.480 --> 3:27:15.480]  She has called me names and insulted me just for sitting down the seat saying that I came here to celebrate today.
[3:27:15.480 --> 3:27:17.480]  Here she goes. Fully triggered.
[3:27:17.480 --> 3:27:26.480]  I would like for him to change seats. I want him to change seats. I'm going to get all the money as well. If you don't have that money, I will get it.
[3:27:26.480 --> 3:27:29.480]  And scold it like the little child you are.
[3:27:29.480 --> 3:27:33.480]  You pretend you have the moral high ground, but you put that man's finger on the mirror.
[3:27:33.480 --> 3:27:37.480]  She said, you pretend like you have the moral high ground.
[3:27:37.480 --> 3:27:38.480]  What?
[3:27:38.480 --> 3:27:41.480]  Did you know gravity is just a fear?
[3:27:41.480 --> 3:27:43.480]  Yeah, and now she's saying, now she goes...
[3:27:43.480 --> 3:27:45.480]  She's the one that thinks she's got the moral high ground.
[3:27:45.480 --> 3:27:52.480]  Now she goes full hilltard and she says, oh, you probably don't believe in gravity either.
[3:27:52.480 --> 3:27:53.480]  Right.
[3:27:53.480 --> 3:27:56.480]  This woman is totally insane.
[3:27:56.480 --> 3:27:59.480]  Now again, here's what happens. She's sitting next to a Trump supporter on the plane.
[3:27:59.480 --> 3:28:04.480]  He's just wearing a Trump inauguration shirt and she refuses to fly with him. She wants him kicked off the plane.
[3:28:04.480 --> 3:28:06.480]  She's called for hostilities.
[3:28:06.480 --> 3:28:10.480]  She gets kicked off the plane. Now she's getting scolded by the airport staff.
[3:28:10.480 --> 3:28:15.480]  Now she tells them, you know, don't even put your arm on the armrest. You disgust me.
[3:28:15.480 --> 3:28:20.480]  I'm going home now. I'm not getting off the plane. I'm entitled.
[3:28:20.480 --> 3:28:23.480]  She's...
[3:28:23.480 --> 3:28:25.480]  I don't know if this translates well to radio.
[3:28:25.480 --> 3:28:31.480]  And then she goes on and she's like, oh, she's like, I'm in my space. I paid for my ticket.
[3:28:31.480 --> 3:28:33.480]  And there she is getting kicked off the plane.
[3:28:33.480 --> 3:28:34.480]  Didn't he pay for his ticket?
[3:28:34.480 --> 3:28:35.480]  Exactly.
[3:28:35.480 --> 3:28:36.480]  And he...
[3:28:36.480 --> 3:28:40.480]  And then the cheers. Yeah. Yeah.
[3:28:40.480 --> 3:28:44.480]  I'll tell you, this is the new America. This is the Trump effect. Suck it up, Buttercup.
[3:28:44.480 --> 3:28:47.480]  That's what I like to call a snowflake meltdown right there.
[3:28:47.480 --> 3:28:49.480]  Bye, Felicia. You're off the plane.
[3:28:49.480 --> 3:28:53.480]  So I was actually... I actually made this analogy that Donald Trump...
[3:28:53.480 --> 3:28:58.480]  There's like these huge space heaters that they put on the side of football games when it's really cold out.
[3:28:58.480 --> 3:29:02.480]  There's like this massive, like you're just blasting heat out.
[3:29:02.480 --> 3:29:05.480]  And that's what Donald Trump is to these snowflakes.
[3:29:05.480 --> 3:29:09.480]  So he's blasting out and then these little snowflakes come in and they just immediately melt.
[3:29:09.480 --> 3:29:11.480]  Well, that's the thing is how bold is this woman?
[3:29:11.480 --> 3:29:16.480]  And so these are just all of these women, you know, thinking this is just the beginning as they're saying.
[3:29:16.480 --> 3:29:20.480]  So they truly feel like they run the world now. They have the moral high ground.
[3:29:20.480 --> 3:29:21.480]  The future is female.
[3:29:21.480 --> 3:29:25.480]  They can kick people off the planes and demand people move their seats.
[3:29:25.480 --> 3:29:26.480]  The future is female.
[3:29:26.480 --> 3:29:30.480]  That's funny that Ashley brings that up because that was something that was very confusing to me over the weekend.
[3:29:30.480 --> 3:29:32.480]  But I actually found the answer.
[3:29:32.480 --> 3:29:37.480]  So we'll talk about that and I will also talk about Ashley with our experience being in the streets
[3:29:37.480 --> 3:29:40.480]  with these protesters and the madness that we ensued.
[3:29:40.480 --> 3:29:44.480]  I mean, I don't know if you got assaulted like I did, but I'm sure you were touched in weird manners.
[3:29:44.480 --> 3:29:45.480]  That just seems inevitable.
[3:29:45.480 --> 3:29:49.480]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show. We've got 30 minutes left. Don't go anywhere.
[3:29:49.480 --> 3:29:53.480]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[3:29:53.480 --> 3:29:54.480]  They just can't help them.
[3:29:54.480 --> 3:29:57.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:57.480 --> 3:30:05.480]  Well, it's no secret that Hillary Clinton is the one that coined the term deplorables
[3:30:05.480 --> 3:30:08.480]  and that we stole it, ran with it and now owned it.
[3:30:08.480 --> 3:30:13.480]  But let's recap some of the behavior we saw over the past election and at the inauguration.
[3:30:13.480 --> 3:30:16.480]  People protesting Trump were assaulting reporters,
[3:30:16.480 --> 3:30:20.480]  burning limos, smashing buildings, throwing stink bombs,
[3:30:20.480 --> 3:30:23.480]  disrupting the inauguration and other events that were happening,
[3:30:23.480 --> 3:30:26.480]  blocking streets, cursing at reporters.
[3:30:26.480 --> 3:30:29.480]  At the Women's March, you had people on the stage cursing repeatedly,
[3:30:29.480 --> 3:30:34.480]  talking about fallatio on air, saying Trump can fallatio himself,
[3:30:34.480 --> 3:30:39.480]  threatening to bomb the White House, wearing pussy hats, spitting on people.
[3:30:39.480 --> 3:30:42.480]  How about all the assassination threats we've seen on Twitter?
[3:30:42.480 --> 3:30:45.480]  I'm not seeing any of that from Trump supporters.
[3:30:45.480 --> 3:30:47.480]  So after all, who are the real deplorables?
[3:30:47.480 --> 3:30:49.480]  I've said it once and I'll say it again.
[3:30:49.480 --> 3:30:53.480]  When they go low, they go really, really low.
[3:30:53.480 --> 3:30:59.480]  This is Owen Schreuer for infowars.com. Real news, fake deplorable.

[3:32:41.480 --> 3:32:42.480]  They're in full crisis mode.

[3:33:15.480 --> 3:33:22.480]  It's Alex Jones.
[3:33:22.480 --> 3:33:27.480]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:27.480 --> 3:33:32.480]  And once again, I have to remind you, please go to infowars.com.
[3:33:32.480 --> 3:33:34.480]  Support our products and I'm telling you folks,
[3:33:34.480 --> 3:33:36.480]  once you go and you try these products, you're going to go back.
[3:33:36.480 --> 3:33:38.480]  You're going to become a regular user.
[3:33:38.480 --> 3:33:39.480]  That's how it was for me.
[3:33:39.480 --> 3:33:40.480]  That's what Ashley was talking about.
[3:33:40.480 --> 3:33:42.480]  We were talking about all the sales we have and she was like,
[3:33:42.480 --> 3:33:44.480]  hey, is super female on sale?
[3:33:44.480 --> 3:33:45.480]  That's one of my favorite products.
[3:33:45.480 --> 3:33:46.480]  You better have that on sale.
[3:33:46.480 --> 3:33:48.480]  That's actually sexist.
[3:33:48.480 --> 3:33:49.480]  Right.
[3:33:49.480 --> 3:33:50.480]  That's gender inequality.
[3:33:50.480 --> 3:33:52.480]  Because the super male vitality is 30% off,
[3:33:52.480 --> 3:33:56.480]  but super female vitality is also 30% off.
[3:33:56.480 --> 3:33:57.480]  And you know what?
[3:33:57.480 --> 3:34:00.480]  I mentioned secret 12, the B12 supplement.
[3:34:00.480 --> 3:34:03.480]  It's actually sold out right now unless you have the auto ship feature.
[3:34:03.480 --> 3:34:06.480]  If you sign up for auto ship, we always have these products on reserve.
[3:34:06.480 --> 3:34:09.480]  But the truth of the matter is the products are so good.
[3:34:09.480 --> 3:34:10.480]  That's why they sell out.
[3:34:10.480 --> 3:34:12.480]  Secret 12 is such a great product.
[3:34:12.480 --> 3:34:13.480]  And that's the other thing you were mentioning.
[3:34:13.480 --> 3:34:14.480]  Oh, that's too bad.
[3:34:14.480 --> 3:34:16.480]  It's out because that's one of your favorite products too.
[3:34:16.480 --> 3:34:17.480]  It's a great product.
[3:34:17.480 --> 3:34:18.480]  I take it almost every morning.
[3:34:18.480 --> 3:34:21.480]  Yeah, and then my third favorite is the iodine.
[3:34:21.480 --> 3:34:22.480]  Because it's electrifying.
[3:34:22.480 --> 3:34:24.480]  That's my first favorite.
[3:34:24.480 --> 3:34:28.480]  That's what really attracted me to InfoWars was all the nutritional supplements.
[3:34:28.480 --> 3:34:33.480]  They're so high quality because I'd been searching for years to find high quality supplements.
[3:34:33.480 --> 3:34:34.480]  And here we are.
[3:34:34.480 --> 3:34:37.480]  And you're probably someone like myself who's always been like a supplement head,
[3:34:37.480 --> 3:34:39.480]  kind of like a health freak.
[3:34:39.480 --> 3:34:40.480]  I love that.
[3:34:40.480 --> 3:34:42.480]  And it's just, you know, these are things that your body needs.
[3:34:42.480 --> 3:34:43.480]  These are natural supplements.
[3:34:43.480 --> 3:34:44.480]  Your body needs.
[3:34:44.480 --> 3:34:46.480]  They've been taken out of the food sources.
[3:34:46.480 --> 3:34:48.480]  And you just, you know, it's hard to eat healthy these days.
[3:34:48.480 --> 3:34:49.480]  I mean, we know how it is.
[3:34:49.480 --> 3:34:51.480]  So try out these products.
[3:34:51.480 --> 3:34:52.480]  Brain force, 30% off.
[3:34:52.480 --> 3:34:54.480]  That seems to be a crowd favorite.
[3:34:54.480 --> 3:34:57.480]  My top three, I'd say, Nates and Iodine is number one.
[3:34:57.480 --> 3:34:59.480]  After that, Pride DNA force.
[3:34:59.480 --> 3:35:00.480]  And then I don't know.
[3:35:00.480 --> 3:35:01.480]  Everything is great.
[3:35:01.480 --> 3:35:02.480]  Actually, the vitamin mineral fusion is great too.
[3:35:02.480 --> 3:35:03.480]  I take that every morning.
[3:35:03.480 --> 3:35:06.480]  So go to infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com,
[3:35:06.480 --> 3:35:08.480]  support this broadcast, help expand InfoWars.
[3:35:08.480 --> 3:35:10.480]  Alex says he wants to create a war room.
[3:35:10.480 --> 3:35:12.480]  I think that would be awesome.
[3:35:12.480 --> 3:35:14.480]  My house is a war room.
[3:35:14.480 --> 3:35:15.480]  You've seen it, Leanne.
[3:35:15.480 --> 3:35:17.480]  I would love to have that at the office.
[3:35:17.480 --> 3:35:20.480]  I'm like a sponge when I sit here and absorb all this food.
[3:35:20.480 --> 3:35:22.480]  I don't know how you don't go mad with your living room
[3:35:22.480 --> 3:35:25.480]  that has like 20 televisions all on the mainstream media.
[3:35:25.480 --> 3:35:26.480]  Oh, wow.
[3:35:26.480 --> 3:35:29.480]  I have, I monitor, I monitor, it is,
[3:35:29.480 --> 3:35:32.480]  I monitor the mainstream media constantly from my house.
[3:35:32.480 --> 3:35:34.480]  You got to keep your pulse on the propaganda.
[3:35:34.480 --> 3:35:35.480]  Okay.
[3:35:35.480 --> 3:35:36.480]  So before we went to break,
[3:35:36.480 --> 3:35:40.480]  Ashley mentioned the protesters that were out in Washington DC.
[3:35:40.480 --> 3:35:42.480]  Did you see them in Austin too?
[3:35:42.480 --> 3:35:44.480]  That said the female, the future is female.
[3:35:44.480 --> 3:35:45.480]  Oh, yes.
[3:35:45.480 --> 3:35:47.480]  I had a woman actually who was wearing a shirt.
[3:35:47.480 --> 3:35:50.480]  It's going to be in my report that's coming out tonight
[3:35:50.480 --> 3:35:52.480]  about the women's march here in Austin.
[3:35:52.480 --> 3:35:55.480]  And she was walking next to a topless woman.
[3:35:55.480 --> 3:35:56.480]  Oh, man.
[3:35:56.480 --> 3:35:58.480]  I saw him in DC too.
[3:35:58.480 --> 3:35:59.480]  Oh, my God.
[3:35:59.480 --> 3:36:02.480]  So on her chest, it said, not for you.
[3:36:02.480 --> 3:36:03.480]  And then the woman walking.
[3:36:03.480 --> 3:36:05.480]  As she's walking around with her chest out.
[3:36:05.480 --> 3:36:07.480]  It's not for you, but I'm smiling for the camera.
[3:36:07.480 --> 3:36:08.480]  Hello.
[3:36:08.480 --> 3:36:13.480]  So next to her, her friend was wearing the future is female T-shirt.
[3:36:13.480 --> 3:36:16.480]  So that's their whole thing now is they actually,
[3:36:16.480 --> 3:36:19.480]  science has said we can create.
[3:36:19.480 --> 3:36:25.480]  I believe you can create a female by using to over to female over.
[3:36:25.480 --> 3:36:26.480]  So there you go.
[3:36:26.480 --> 3:36:27.480]  We can create babies without men.
[3:36:27.480 --> 3:36:29.480]  It's funny because I was asking them,
[3:36:29.480 --> 3:36:31.480]  what does that sign mean?
[3:36:31.480 --> 3:36:32.480]  What does your shirt mean?
[3:36:32.480 --> 3:36:33.480]  What do you mean the future is female?
[3:36:33.480 --> 3:36:34.480]  They didn't answer.
[3:36:34.480 --> 3:36:36.480]  They were just, well, Trump is a misogynist.
[3:36:36.480 --> 3:36:38.480]  We won't have a misogynist in power.
[3:36:38.480 --> 3:36:39.480]  That was their only answer.
[3:36:39.480 --> 3:36:41.480]  Not an anti-Trump march, though.
[3:36:41.480 --> 3:36:46.480]  But we can create babies without men is now what the scientists are claiming.
[3:36:46.480 --> 3:36:47.480]  So that's what they were.
[3:36:47.480 --> 3:36:50.480]  That's what they meant to say when I asked them.
[3:36:50.480 --> 3:36:51.480]  They just didn't know it.
[3:36:51.480 --> 3:36:53.480]  They just hadn't done the research like they claimed they'd done.
[3:36:53.480 --> 3:36:54.480]  Sorry, ladies.
[3:36:54.480 --> 3:36:57.480]  I don't want a planet without men.
[3:36:57.480 --> 3:36:58.480]  I think actually.
[3:36:58.480 --> 3:36:59.480]  This is an anti-men.
[3:36:59.480 --> 3:37:00.480]  This is an anti.
[3:37:00.480 --> 3:37:01.480]  This is an anti-men.
[3:37:01.480 --> 3:37:02.480]  Sorry, ladies.
[3:37:02.480 --> 3:37:03.480]  I can't do it.
[3:37:03.480 --> 3:37:04.480]  I agree.
[3:37:04.480 --> 3:37:05.480]  So, you know what?
[3:37:05.480 --> 3:37:08.480]  Here's kind of my new thing actually in the face of all these feminists,
[3:37:08.480 --> 3:37:11.480]  which by the way, I'm just going to give you,
[3:37:11.480 --> 3:37:13.480]  I'm just going to just give this message out right now.
[3:37:13.480 --> 3:37:18.480]  Dear feminists, please shower, please shave all of humanity.
[3:37:18.480 --> 3:37:20.480]  But here's my thing.
[3:37:20.480 --> 3:37:21.480]  So I'm now a masculinist.
[3:37:21.480 --> 3:37:23.480]  How do you feel about that?
[3:37:23.480 --> 3:37:24.480]  I'm a masculinist.
[3:37:24.480 --> 3:37:25.480]  Okay.
[3:37:25.480 --> 3:37:26.480]  Are you guys down with that?
[3:37:26.480 --> 3:37:27.480]  Well, there were a lot of, I'm down with it.
[3:37:27.480 --> 3:37:29.480]  There's a lot of Miss Andrews out there.
[3:37:29.480 --> 3:37:34.480]  I mean, I think promoting masculinity is one of the most important things that we need to do right now.
[3:37:34.480 --> 3:37:36.480]  Also, I was talking about when I was out there,
[3:37:36.480 --> 3:37:38.480]  how there's so many androgynous people.
[3:37:38.480 --> 3:37:43.480]  I feel like the guys actually subconsciously probably feel
[3:37:43.480 --> 3:37:47.480]  that it's easier to live as a woman than it is to live as a man
[3:37:47.480 --> 3:37:51.480]  because it's so much pressures from being masculine, being a male.
[3:37:51.480 --> 3:37:52.480]  What do you think?
[3:37:52.480 --> 3:37:54.480]  Do you think women have it easier or men have it easier?
[3:37:54.480 --> 3:37:55.480]  Well, you know what?
[3:37:55.480 --> 3:37:56.480]  Let's be honest.
[3:37:56.480 --> 3:37:58.480]  There's different advantages for being a woman.
[3:37:58.480 --> 3:38:00.480]  There's different advantages for being a man.
[3:38:00.480 --> 3:38:01.480]  And there's different differences.
[3:38:01.480 --> 3:38:03.480]  These are biological differences, not social constructs.
[3:38:03.480 --> 3:38:06.480]  But it's funny because we saw a ton of the people.
[3:38:06.480 --> 3:38:08.480]  You can see these in the videos.
[3:38:08.480 --> 3:38:11.480]  I mean, look, I don't want to make fun of these kids.
[3:38:11.480 --> 3:38:12.480]  These are young kids.
[3:38:12.480 --> 3:38:13.480]  I don't know what their deal is.
[3:38:13.480 --> 3:38:16.480]  But they all look like they are raised on baby formula.
[3:38:16.480 --> 3:38:17.480]  You know what I'm saying?
[3:38:17.480 --> 3:38:19.480]  And I'll just leave it right there.
[3:38:19.480 --> 3:38:22.480]  But we've witnessed it in these videos,
[3:38:22.480 --> 3:38:24.480]  and they really are completely clueless.
[3:38:24.480 --> 3:38:25.480]  And here's the other thing.
[3:38:25.480 --> 3:38:26.480]  They're out here.
[3:38:26.480 --> 3:38:27.480]  They're feminists, right?
[3:38:27.480 --> 3:38:32.480]  Well, how feminine is it to walk up to a man and strike him in the face?
[3:38:32.480 --> 3:38:33.480]  For no reason.
[3:38:33.480 --> 3:38:34.480]  That's assault.
[3:38:34.480 --> 3:38:35.480]  That's not ladylike behavior.
[3:38:35.480 --> 3:38:36.480]  Right.
[3:38:36.480 --> 3:38:37.480]  That's sexist.
[3:38:37.480 --> 3:38:39.480]  If you had done that, that would have been assault.
[3:38:39.480 --> 3:38:43.480]  Or them coming up and hugging you and like squeezing, hugging you.
[3:38:43.480 --> 3:38:44.480]  That was just weird.
[3:38:44.480 --> 3:38:45.480]  I can't even.
[3:38:45.480 --> 3:38:46.480]  That was just strange.
[3:38:46.480 --> 3:38:48.480]  If you had done that to them, they would have cried.
[3:38:48.480 --> 3:38:49.480]  Right?
[3:38:49.480 --> 3:38:52.480]  And by the way, Alex Jones is not exaggerating.
[3:38:52.480 --> 3:38:53.480]  He's not joking.
[3:38:53.480 --> 3:38:56.480]  They really do come up to you and hump you.
[3:38:56.480 --> 3:38:58.480]  That actually happens.
[3:38:58.480 --> 3:38:59.480]  It sounds extreme.
[3:38:59.480 --> 3:39:00.480]  It sounds crazy.
[3:39:00.480 --> 3:39:02.480]  No, I'm telling you, it happened to me multiple times.
[3:39:02.480 --> 3:39:04.480]  They come up and they hump you.
[3:39:04.480 --> 3:39:06.480]  And this is what we were talking about.
[3:39:06.480 --> 3:39:07.480]  We were kind of saying this in the break.
[3:39:07.480 --> 3:39:10.480]  They do this like protest limbo, where they just keep lowering the bar.
[3:39:10.480 --> 3:39:11.480]  Right.
[3:39:11.480 --> 3:39:13.480]  They see how low can the protests go.
[3:39:13.480 --> 3:39:14.480]  So that's the thing.
[3:39:14.480 --> 3:39:15.480]  All right.
[3:39:15.480 --> 3:39:17.480]  So Ashley, so I actually love these videos.
[3:39:17.480 --> 3:39:19.480]  I think that our audience loves these videos.
[3:39:19.480 --> 3:39:21.480]  I love making them.
[3:39:21.480 --> 3:39:24.480]  You know, where we go out on the street, we do the first person video style.
[3:39:24.480 --> 3:39:27.480]  We have the camera phone in our hand and we walk up to these people.
[3:39:27.480 --> 3:39:30.480]  We try to have a conversation and we experience the same thing every time.
[3:39:30.480 --> 3:39:33.480]  For me, it's how is Trump racist?
[3:39:33.480 --> 3:39:34.480]  Are you kidding me?
[3:39:34.480 --> 3:39:37.480]  For you, it was, you know, oh, what are Hillary Clinton's merits?
[3:39:37.480 --> 3:39:38.480]  Are you kidding me?
[3:39:38.480 --> 3:39:41.480]  And we capture it time and time and time again.
[3:39:41.480 --> 3:39:46.480]  And I think what we're seeing now is the culture war is starting to hit home where you're
[3:39:46.480 --> 3:39:49.480]  seeing people like this being kicked off of airplanes.
[3:39:49.480 --> 3:39:53.480]  You're seeing, you know, Donald Trump winning a presidential election.
[3:39:53.480 --> 3:39:58.480]  Marine Le Pen, I'm seeing social media polls now where Marine Le Pen is just dominating,
[3:39:58.480 --> 3:40:01.480]  just dominating to be the next, the next leader in France.
[3:40:01.480 --> 3:40:03.480]  It's not even close right now.
[3:40:03.480 --> 3:40:08.480]  You know, nationalist leaders in Italy, nationalist leaders in Brazil all over the planet.
[3:40:08.480 --> 3:40:10.480]  And I think that this is kind of coming together.
[3:40:10.480 --> 3:40:15.480]  And because, you know, not just us, but other people are out there documenting the complete
[3:40:15.480 --> 3:40:20.480]  ignorance double standard of these people protesting of these people whining and crying in the streets.
[3:40:20.480 --> 3:40:23.480]  They're like, okay, you know what, we're done with these people.
[3:40:23.480 --> 3:40:25.480]  These people are, are nothing.
[3:40:25.480 --> 3:40:27.480]  They don't control exactly.
[3:40:27.480 --> 3:40:28.480]  Exactly.
[3:40:28.480 --> 3:40:31.480]  So for you, Ashley, tell me, maybe we can just talk about what was the craziest thing
[3:40:31.480 --> 3:40:34.480]  that you witnessed or the weirdest thing you witnessed when you were out in Austin?
[3:40:34.480 --> 3:40:41.480]  Well, I'd definitely say it was the nude women and the androgynous people and people who just
[3:40:41.480 --> 3:40:43.480]  really couldn't speak at all.
[3:40:43.480 --> 3:40:49.480]  Literally, they refused to speak as to what their position was, but they wanted to yell at
[3:40:49.480 --> 3:40:51.480]  me just because they see me wearing a Trump hat.
[3:40:51.480 --> 3:40:56.480]  They want to say black lives matter, but they don't care if you don't agree with them.
[3:40:56.480 --> 3:40:57.480]  Okay, we have Alex.
[3:40:57.480 --> 3:40:58.480]  Do we have a troll?
[3:40:58.480 --> 3:41:00.480]  Do we have a troll in studio right now?
[3:41:00.480 --> 3:41:01.480]  Goblin.
[3:41:01.480 --> 3:41:03.480]  Oh, we have a goblin, a goblin troll.
[3:41:03.480 --> 3:41:05.480]  I just saw Goofy walking by on the cameras.
[3:41:05.480 --> 3:41:07.480]  I stood in the camera for a second.
[3:41:07.480 --> 3:41:08.480]  I officially walked out.
[3:41:08.480 --> 3:41:11.480]  I was a kid that had Dallas Cowboy parties at the house.
[3:41:11.480 --> 3:41:14.480]  I was a kid that had Dallas Cowboy parties at the house.
[3:41:14.480 --> 3:41:16.480]  I was always standing in front of the television.
[3:41:16.480 --> 3:41:19.480]  Make a better wall than a window.
[3:41:19.480 --> 3:41:20.480]  Better wall than a window.
[3:41:20.480 --> 3:41:21.480]  Some of them were chanting at me.
[3:41:21.480 --> 3:41:23.480]  Actually, they were chanting at me.
[3:41:23.480 --> 3:41:24.480]  You can see it in the video.
[3:41:24.480 --> 3:41:25.480]  Don't feed the troll.
[3:41:25.480 --> 3:41:26.480]  Don't feed the troll.
[3:41:26.480 --> 3:41:28.480]  And I was like, wait a second.
[3:41:28.480 --> 3:41:31.480]  You being out here protesting is feeding the troll.
[3:41:31.480 --> 3:41:33.480]  You already fed the troll.
[3:41:33.480 --> 3:41:35.480]  You can eat buffet for the troll.
[3:41:35.480 --> 3:41:37.480]  Yeah, you drew me here.
[3:41:37.480 --> 3:41:38.480]  Triggering.
[3:41:38.480 --> 3:41:39.480]  Yes.
[3:41:39.480 --> 3:41:40.480]  Yeah, I came here.
[3:41:40.480 --> 3:41:42.480]  I came to the protest to troll you.
[3:41:42.480 --> 3:41:44.480]  I'm just embracing it right now.
[3:41:44.480 --> 3:41:46.480]  In fact, this is what I'm going to do because they always ask me,
[3:41:46.480 --> 3:41:47.480]  well, are you out here?
[3:41:47.480 --> 3:41:49.480]  Oh, and I'm like, well, you know what?
[3:41:49.480 --> 3:41:51.480]  Here's why I'm out here because I'm the white male troll.
[3:41:51.480 --> 3:41:52.480]  How do you like that?
[3:41:52.480 --> 3:41:55.480]  I am the white male troll and I'm here to troll you.
[3:41:55.480 --> 3:41:56.480]  Trolling you with his privilege.
[3:41:56.480 --> 3:41:58.480]  So yes, if you're going to be out in the streets protesting,
[3:41:58.480 --> 3:42:01.480]  I'm going to be out here trolling you with my white male privilege.
[3:42:01.480 --> 3:42:02.480]  And what's going to happen?
[3:42:02.480 --> 3:42:04.480]  You're going to completely embarrass yourself.
[3:42:04.480 --> 3:42:05.480]  I don't know, Ashley.
[3:42:05.480 --> 3:42:06.480]  What do you think about that?
[3:42:06.480 --> 3:42:08.480]  Well, that was basically the same for me.
[3:42:08.480 --> 3:42:11.480]  I was calling myself, you know, F and black female.
[3:42:11.480 --> 3:42:14.480]  I said, don't try to, you know, adjust your television screen.
[3:42:14.480 --> 3:42:18.480]  I am a black woman wearing a Trump hat.
[3:42:18.480 --> 3:42:20.480]  I did support Donald Trump.
[3:42:20.480 --> 3:42:23.480]  I know it makes you very, very confused.
[3:42:23.480 --> 3:42:25.480]  Your eyes and rods and pixels are all fine.
[3:42:25.480 --> 3:42:27.480]  Oh man, they just couldn't take it.
[3:42:27.480 --> 3:42:30.480]  I mean, they weren't willing to accept another point of view.
[3:42:30.480 --> 3:42:33.480]  I barely could even get people to talk to me.
[3:42:33.480 --> 3:42:36.480]  They would scream at me and then I try to get them to say something on camera
[3:42:36.480 --> 3:42:38.480]  that actually made sense and they couldn't even.
[3:42:38.480 --> 3:42:42.480]  Isn't it so incredible that they make the argument that you are brainwashed
[3:42:42.480 --> 3:42:46.480]  or that you are, you know, being subservient to the white man or whatever?
[3:42:46.480 --> 3:42:52.480]  When it's like you literally are being brainwashed by the party that founded the KKK,
[3:42:52.480 --> 3:42:55.480]  who has convinced you that at some point in time,
[3:42:55.480 --> 3:43:02.480]  the KKK who was like out there at the DNC in like the 1924 or something like,
[3:43:02.480 --> 3:43:05.480]  en masse, that all of a sudden they all went to the Republican side.
[3:43:05.480 --> 3:43:06.480]  It's the same thing though.
[3:43:06.480 --> 3:43:08.480]  It's the same thing, whether it's like, oh, they tell you,
[3:43:08.480 --> 3:43:11.480]  oh, you're black, you can't like Trump or oh, you're a woman, you can't like Trump.
[3:43:11.480 --> 3:43:14.480]  It's like, no, I'm a woman, I'll choose what I like.
[3:43:14.480 --> 3:43:16.480]  I'm black, I'll choose what I like.
[3:43:16.480 --> 3:43:17.480]  You don't tell me what to like.
[3:43:17.480 --> 3:43:20.480]  I thought this was about freedom and equality and I can do, you know,
[3:43:20.480 --> 3:43:22.480]  as I wish as a free woman.
[3:43:22.480 --> 3:43:24.480]  Right, my body, my choice, right?
[3:43:24.480 --> 3:43:28.480]  So I'm going to use my body to support Donald Trump's support.
[3:43:28.480 --> 3:43:31.480]  I just was talking about the phrase, make America great again.
[3:43:31.480 --> 3:43:33.480]  What is wrong with that phrase?
[3:43:33.480 --> 3:43:35.480]  They want to say, well, America's already great.
[3:43:35.480 --> 3:43:37.480]  Well, obviously we're looking around, right?
[3:43:37.480 --> 3:43:38.480]  Or it was never great.
[3:43:38.480 --> 3:43:40.480]  They can't get that argument straight.
[3:43:40.480 --> 3:43:41.480]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:43:41.480 --> 3:43:44.480]  They can't figure out whether it was never great or it's, you know, great now
[3:43:44.480 --> 3:43:48.480]  or they just can't get down with what Donald Trump is saying.
[3:43:48.480 --> 3:43:50.480]  Anything he says is going to be the opposite.
[3:43:50.480 --> 3:43:51.480]  Yeah, right.
[3:43:51.480 --> 3:43:54.480]  You know, and I actually, when I was in Washington,
[3:43:54.480 --> 3:43:57.480]  one night we ended up at a legion post
[3:43:57.480 --> 3:44:00.480]  and we were having a good time with some of the veterans
[3:44:00.480 --> 3:44:03.480]  and this was specifically, I don't know if it was like this normally,
[3:44:03.480 --> 3:44:06.480]  but the regulars, all of them were black that were there.
[3:44:06.480 --> 3:44:10.480]  And we all got to talking and they didn't all love Trump,
[3:44:10.480 --> 3:44:12.480]  but the ones that didn't like Trump, you know, they were like,
[3:44:12.480 --> 3:44:13.480]  oh, we'll give him a chance.
[3:44:13.480 --> 3:44:15.480]  But then a lot of them were like, yeah, I love Trump.
[3:44:15.480 --> 3:44:17.480]  And one of them even said to me, he was telling a story
[3:44:17.480 --> 3:44:19.480]  and I got this guy's contact information.
[3:44:19.480 --> 3:44:20.480]  He was a brilliant man.
[3:44:20.480 --> 3:44:22.480]  I actually hoped to maybe get him on the show sometime.
[3:44:22.480 --> 3:44:25.480]  He was like, you know, they tried to say that America was never great.
[3:44:25.480 --> 3:44:27.480]  And he talked about how when he was a kid
[3:44:27.480 --> 3:44:29.480]  growing up in Chicago in the 40s and 50s,
[3:44:29.480 --> 3:44:33.480]  he actually experienced real racism.
[3:44:33.480 --> 3:44:35.480]  He told me a story about how there was a huge difference
[3:44:35.480 --> 3:44:38.480]  between trying to go to a Cubs game and trying to go a White Sox game
[3:44:38.480 --> 3:44:42.480]  where at the Cubs game you had the rich white elite people that were going
[3:44:42.480 --> 3:44:45.480]  and they didn't want, you know, the public housing black kids
[3:44:45.480 --> 3:44:46.480]  to show up at the game.
[3:44:46.480 --> 3:44:48.480]  So they would try to shoo them away.
[3:44:48.480 --> 3:44:50.480]  Like literally they would like shuffle them off the block
[3:44:50.480 --> 3:44:51.480]  and he would experience that.
[3:44:51.480 --> 3:44:53.480]  And he said, if he went to a White Sox game though,
[3:44:53.480 --> 3:44:54.480]  they would be more welcoming.
[3:44:54.480 --> 3:44:56.480]  They would welcome in, you know, public housing kids.
[3:44:56.480 --> 3:44:58.480]  They would welcome in people that were out on the streets.
[3:44:58.480 --> 3:45:00.480]  It was a more welcoming environment.
[3:45:00.480 --> 3:45:02.480]  And even he was telling me the story.
[3:45:02.480 --> 3:45:03.480]  And he was like, you know what though,
[3:45:03.480 --> 3:45:05.480]  even having to deal with that racism,
[3:45:05.480 --> 3:45:08.480]  even having to deal growing up in that community
[3:45:08.480 --> 3:45:11.480]  and the things that even kept him away from Chicago
[3:45:11.480 --> 3:45:13.480]  still to this day that he dealt with,
[3:45:13.480 --> 3:45:15.480]  he still said that he thought America was great.
[3:45:15.480 --> 3:45:18.480]  He still said that he knows that there's no other country
[3:45:18.480 --> 3:45:20.480]  where he would have rather grown up in
[3:45:20.480 --> 3:45:22.480]  and where he would have rather been.
[3:45:22.480 --> 3:45:24.480]  So he really took that personally.
[3:45:24.480 --> 3:45:26.480]  And it was something that hit home with me.
[3:45:26.480 --> 3:45:28.480]  That personally as someone who,
[3:45:28.480 --> 3:45:31.480]  unlike these protesters out in the streets,
[3:45:31.480 --> 3:45:33.480]  he actually experienced the things
[3:45:33.480 --> 3:45:34.480]  that they're complaining about
[3:45:34.480 --> 3:45:37.480]  that they think are setting America back now.
[3:45:37.480 --> 3:45:38.480]  No, he experienced that in the past
[3:45:38.480 --> 3:45:40.480]  and now he sees that we're past that.
[3:45:40.480 --> 3:45:42.480]  Why are you still clinging to that?
[3:45:42.480 --> 3:45:43.480]  Right, you and you have the opportunity
[3:45:43.480 --> 3:45:45.480]  to truly flourish here in this country,
[3:45:45.480 --> 3:45:46.480]  which is why, you know,
[3:45:46.480 --> 3:45:47.480]  I know you've talked,
[3:45:47.480 --> 3:45:49.480]  brought in a lot of these executive orders.
[3:45:49.480 --> 3:45:50.480]  Yeah, let's talk about these.
[3:45:50.480 --> 3:45:52.480]  I think it's going to be so incredible
[3:45:52.480 --> 3:45:55.480]  if people just give him the opportunity to let this,
[3:45:55.480 --> 3:45:58.480]  you know, let his plan, his agenda kind of take place.
[3:45:58.480 --> 3:45:59.480]  They're going to be surprised
[3:45:59.480 --> 3:46:01.480]  with how much better everything is.
[3:46:01.480 --> 3:46:02.480]  But the news, the mainstream news
[3:46:02.480 --> 3:46:04.480]  doesn't want to talk about
[3:46:04.480 --> 3:46:06.480]  the things that he's already done in his first three days
[3:46:06.480 --> 3:46:08.480]  because that's great for everyone.
[3:46:08.480 --> 3:46:09.480]  It's great for all of us.
[3:46:09.480 --> 3:46:10.480]  It doesn't divide us.
[3:46:10.480 --> 3:46:12.480]  Right, let's talk about the fact
[3:46:12.480 --> 3:46:14.480]  that a new Trump White House website
[3:46:14.480 --> 3:46:17.480]  sets agenda that mirrors campaign pledges.
[3:46:17.480 --> 3:46:20.480]  So we already have Trump going ahead
[3:46:20.480 --> 3:46:23.480]  and fulfilling those campaign pledges that he made.
[3:46:23.480 --> 3:46:26.480]  Also, I like this, Trump reinstates ban
[3:46:26.480 --> 3:46:29.480]  on U.S. funds promoting abortion overseas.
[3:46:29.480 --> 3:46:31.480]  Now, that's what we really want to see from Donald Trump.
[3:46:31.480 --> 3:46:33.480]  And that's what I really love
[3:46:33.480 --> 3:46:35.480]  because a lot of these crazy social justice
[3:46:35.480 --> 3:46:38.480]  warrior women out there were all about reproductive rights.
[3:46:38.480 --> 3:46:40.480]  They were all about, you know,
[3:46:40.480 --> 3:46:43.480]  let me abort my baby and all this weird stuff,
[3:46:43.480 --> 3:46:45.480]  this, you know, anti-women stuff, really.
[3:46:45.480 --> 3:46:46.480]  And my whole thing is,
[3:46:46.480 --> 3:46:50.480]  why don't you understand the real, you know,
[3:46:50.480 --> 3:46:52.480]  creation of Planned Parenthood?
[3:46:52.480 --> 3:46:54.480]  Why don't you understand where this is all coming
[3:46:54.480 --> 3:46:56.480]  from, Margaret Sanger and depopulation?
[3:46:56.480 --> 3:46:57.480]  Eugenics, okay?
[3:46:57.480 --> 3:46:59.480]  Feeble-minded means black.
[3:46:59.480 --> 3:47:01.480]  Feeble-minded, you know, inferior.
[3:47:01.480 --> 3:47:03.480]  She had all sorts of code words.
[3:47:03.480 --> 3:47:06.480]  That's the Kissinger NSSM Memorandum 200
[3:47:06.480 --> 3:47:08.480]  where he says we're only going to give
[3:47:08.480 --> 3:47:11.480]  these countries federal funds and banking loans
[3:47:11.480 --> 3:47:14.480]  if they agree to abort their babies
[3:47:14.480 --> 3:47:16.480]  and get vaccines and abortions.
[3:47:16.480 --> 3:47:18.480]  Right, and you know what's funny, I just thought of this,
[3:47:18.480 --> 3:47:21.480]  they always want to reference the numbers and the stats
[3:47:21.480 --> 3:47:26.480]  when it comes to police and African-Americans,
[3:47:26.480 --> 3:47:28.480]  but they never want to reference or face the stats
[3:47:28.480 --> 3:47:30.480]  when it comes to abortions in African-Americans.
[3:47:30.480 --> 3:47:31.480]  Exactly, that's what I talked about.
[3:47:31.480 --> 3:47:32.480]  That seems to be a complete double standard.
[3:47:32.480 --> 3:47:33.480]  But when you talk about that,
[3:47:33.480 --> 3:47:35.480]  that issue has been such a political football.
[3:47:35.480 --> 3:47:39.480]  It was started by President Reagan in 1984.
[3:47:39.480 --> 3:47:42.480]  It was then reversed by Bill Clinton in 1993.
[3:47:42.480 --> 3:47:46.480]  Then Bush reinstated it, and then Obama took it back.
[3:47:46.480 --> 3:47:47.480]  And so now Trump has taken it back.
[3:47:47.480 --> 3:47:49.480]  So it's kind of been a political football
[3:47:49.480 --> 3:47:50.480]  between the Republicans and the Democrats.
[3:47:50.480 --> 3:47:52.480]  But to me, it's just unconstitutional
[3:47:52.480 --> 3:47:55.480]  to take anybody's taxpayer dollars
[3:47:55.480 --> 3:47:59.480]  to go towards anything that would be against their religion.
[3:47:59.480 --> 3:48:03.480]  And abortion is obviously against just about any religion
[3:48:03.480 --> 3:48:04.480]  that I could think of.
[3:48:04.480 --> 3:48:06.480]  Right, they're forcing nuns to pay for birth control
[3:48:06.480 --> 3:48:08.480]  and abortions through Obamacare.
[3:48:08.480 --> 3:48:10.480]  And that was one of the main reasons
[3:48:10.480 --> 3:48:13.480]  why they created Obamacare was to force people
[3:48:13.480 --> 3:48:17.480]  who are bitter clingers to support
[3:48:17.480 --> 3:48:20.480]  this whole abortion mindset.
[3:48:20.480 --> 3:48:22.480]  So here's the big one, though.
[3:48:22.480 --> 3:48:24.480]  Trump abandons Trans-Pacific Partnership,
[3:48:24.480 --> 3:48:26.480]  Obama's signature trade deal.
[3:48:26.480 --> 3:48:28.480]  So there's your legacy, Obama.
[3:48:28.480 --> 3:48:31.480]  Signed away day, well, I guess day three.
[3:48:31.480 --> 3:48:33.480]  President Trump formally abandons
[3:48:33.480 --> 3:48:35.480]  the Trans-Pacific Partnership on Monday.
[3:48:35.480 --> 3:48:36.480]  That was today, of course.
[3:48:36.480 --> 3:48:39.480]  He did that in one of his three executive orders.
[3:48:39.480 --> 3:48:40.480]  Excellent.
[3:48:40.480 --> 3:48:42.480]  Well, and it's interesting because with CNN
[3:48:42.480 --> 3:48:43.480]  and all these other mainstream outlets,
[3:48:43.480 --> 3:48:45.480]  they're all painting this as,
[3:48:45.480 --> 3:48:47.480]  oh, Trump has killed the TPP.
[3:48:47.480 --> 3:48:48.480]  Making a way for China.
[3:48:48.480 --> 3:48:50.480]  It's so devastating.
[3:48:50.480 --> 3:48:52.480]  And these are the same establishment media
[3:48:52.480 --> 3:48:54.480]  that were really covering for the fact
[3:48:54.480 --> 3:48:58.480]  that this TPP was being created and navigated in secret,
[3:48:58.480 --> 3:49:00.480]  created by the corporations.
[3:49:00.480 --> 3:49:01.480]  No one was allowed to look at it.
[3:49:01.480 --> 3:49:03.480]  It was going to be a major jobs killer.
[3:49:03.480 --> 3:49:05.480]  It was going to be super bad for our country
[3:49:05.480 --> 3:49:07.480]  and for our workers and for our sovereignty.
[3:49:07.480 --> 3:49:09.480]  Great for the corporations.
[3:49:09.480 --> 3:49:11.480]  And these media outlets were protecting
[3:49:11.480 --> 3:49:12.480]  the Trans-Pacific Partnership
[3:49:12.480 --> 3:49:14.480]  and really trying to promote it as this great thing
[3:49:14.480 --> 3:49:16.480]  now that Trump has done away with it.
[3:49:16.480 --> 3:49:18.480]  And he's trying to explain how terrible
[3:49:18.480 --> 3:49:19.480]  it would have been for America.
[3:49:19.480 --> 3:49:21.480]  The media can't get on that.
[3:49:21.480 --> 3:49:22.480]  They're basically saying.
[3:49:22.480 --> 3:49:23.480]  Well, it was great.
[3:49:23.480 --> 3:49:24.480]  It was great, too, because he signs it.
[3:49:24.480 --> 3:49:25.480]  He says, we've been talking about this.
[3:49:25.480 --> 3:49:26.480]  We're glad to do this.
[3:49:26.480 --> 3:49:27.480]  And then he hit it on the head.
[3:49:27.480 --> 3:49:30.480]  He said, this is good for the American worker.
[3:49:30.480 --> 3:49:31.480]  Exactly.
[3:49:31.480 --> 3:49:33.480]  This is good for the American worker.
[3:49:33.480 --> 3:49:35.480]  It's not great for global government.
[3:49:35.480 --> 3:49:36.480]  And another thing he did today
[3:49:36.480 --> 3:49:38.480]  that's great for the American worker,
[3:49:38.480 --> 3:49:40.480]  Trump, who signed Executive Order on Plan 2,
[3:49:40.480 --> 3:49:42.480]  renegotiate NAFTA with Mexico
[3:49:42.480 --> 3:49:44.480]  and Canada, eliminating the
[3:49:44.480 --> 3:49:46.480]  North American Free Trade Agreement,
[3:49:46.480 --> 3:49:49.480]  which has really created quite a deficit
[3:49:49.480 --> 3:49:51.480]  between trade in the U.S.
[3:49:51.480 --> 3:49:53.480]  and those two countries.
[3:49:53.480 --> 3:49:56.480]  More he's doing for United States industry.
[3:49:56.480 --> 3:49:58.480]  Trump tells business leaders
[3:49:58.480 --> 3:50:01.480]  he wants to cut regulations by 75%
[3:50:01.480 --> 3:50:04.480]  or maybe more in a meeting with
[3:50:04.480 --> 3:50:06.480]  10 senior executives today.
[3:50:06.480 --> 3:50:07.480]  He talked about this.
[3:50:07.480 --> 3:50:08.480]  I don't know.
[3:50:08.480 --> 3:50:12.480]  Maybe I've never seen this come out
[3:50:12.480 --> 3:50:13.480]  of the Obama administration,
[3:50:13.480 --> 3:50:16.480]  where he's inviting everyone to his office.
[3:50:16.480 --> 3:50:18.480]  He's saying, here's the executive orders
[3:50:18.480 --> 3:50:19.480]  we're signing it.
[3:50:19.480 --> 3:50:21.480]  We're highly publicizing this.
[3:50:21.480 --> 3:50:24.480]  Here's why it makes sense for American workers.
[3:50:24.480 --> 3:50:26.480]  We're putting American jobs first.
[3:50:26.480 --> 3:50:28.480]  This is why we're cutting regulations.
[3:50:28.480 --> 3:50:30.480]  And it's all highly publicized.
[3:50:30.480 --> 3:50:32.480]  It's all being done, you know,
[3:50:32.480 --> 3:50:34.480]  so the American people can see it,
[3:50:34.480 --> 3:50:37.480]  not on Christmas Eve, not over New Year.
[3:50:37.480 --> 3:50:38.480]  Transparent administration.
[3:50:38.480 --> 3:50:40.480]  He didn't even promise to do that in his campaign,
[3:50:40.480 --> 3:50:43.480]  like President Obama campaigned on being transparent.
[3:50:43.480 --> 3:50:44.480]  And it's great to see.
[3:50:44.480 --> 3:50:46.480]  And if nothing else, love him or hate him,
[3:50:46.480 --> 3:50:48.480]  it's exciting, it's fun.
[3:50:48.480 --> 3:50:49.480]  It's good having someone in there
[3:50:49.480 --> 3:50:50.480]  that's going to get the job done.
[3:50:50.480 --> 3:50:51.480]  It's Trump's America.
[3:50:51.480 --> 3:50:52.480]  One more segment.
[3:50:52.480 --> 3:50:53.480]  Leanne McAdoo, Ashley Beckford,
[3:50:53.480 --> 3:51:08.480]  Owen Troyer, Alex Joneshowinfowars.com.

[3:52:02.480 --> 3:52:04.480]  but not just any food.
[3:52:04.480 --> 3:52:07.480]  Experts say everyone needs to have non-perishable,
[3:52:07.480 --> 3:52:08.480]  good for 25 years,
[3:52:08.480 --> 3:52:11.480]  survival food on hand in case of an emergency.
[3:52:11.480 --> 3:52:12.480]  Well, right now,
[3:52:12.480 --> 3:52:14.480]  in what is truly an unprecedented move,

[3:52:16.480 --> 3:52:19.480]  given away to listeners while supplies last.
[3:52:19.480 --> 3:52:21.480]  Survival food is more important today
[3:52:21.480 --> 3:52:23.480]  than ever before, explains Frank Pates,
[3:52:23.480 --> 3:52:25.480]  a spokesman for the company.
[3:52:25.480 --> 3:52:27.480]  Natural disasters, terrorist attacks,
[3:52:27.480 --> 3:52:29.480]  and other threats can make obtaining sufficient food
[3:52:29.480 --> 3:52:31.480]  impossible in an emergency.
[3:52:31.480 --> 3:52:35.480]  This 72-hour survival kit has 16 servings of delicious food

[3:54:07.480 --> 3:54:10.480]  Final segment of the Alex Jones show the first Monday
[3:54:10.480 --> 3:54:13.480]  after the inauguration of Donald J. Trump,
[3:54:13.480 --> 3:54:16.480]  Owen Shroyer with you, Ashley Beckford, Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[3:54:16.480 --> 3:54:20.480]  We've covered the two executive orders that we already mentioned.
[3:54:20.480 --> 3:54:23.480]  Trump stopping the federal funding
[3:54:23.480 --> 3:54:27.480]  or the monies going towards NGOs that support abortion.
[3:54:27.480 --> 3:54:29.480]  We talked about, of course, NAFTA.
[3:54:29.480 --> 3:54:31.480]  We talked about TPP.
[3:54:31.480 --> 3:54:34.480]  And another one, Trump on today
[3:54:34.480 --> 3:54:37.480]  issued a freeze on federal hiring.
[3:54:37.480 --> 3:54:40.480]  And when he did this, if you can go see the video,
[3:54:40.480 --> 3:54:43.480]  it's great because I think it's Priebus who says,
[3:54:43.480 --> 3:54:47.480]  this executive order is to freeze federal hiring
[3:54:47.480 --> 3:54:49.480]  and then Trump grabs it and he sides it and he says,
[3:54:49.480 --> 3:54:53.480]  except the military, except the military.
[3:54:53.480 --> 3:54:55.480]  He made it very...
[3:54:55.480 --> 3:54:58.480]  And that's, of course, in the executive order.
[3:54:58.480 --> 3:55:00.480]  But these things are already flying, guys.
[3:55:00.480 --> 3:55:02.480]  We're already seeing the executive orders fly.
[3:55:02.480 --> 3:55:05.480]  And it'll be interesting to see if this is a trend
[3:55:05.480 --> 3:55:08.480]  that happens every day, every week, every month.
[3:55:08.480 --> 3:55:12.480]  I support all of President Trump's executive orders today
[3:55:12.480 --> 3:55:13.480]  that I saw.
[3:55:13.480 --> 3:55:16.480]  As far, yes, and also to his aide, Kellyanne Conway,
[3:55:16.480 --> 3:55:20.480]  said he may not enforce the individual health insurance mandate.
[3:55:20.480 --> 3:55:22.480]  They're looking at that as well as just saying,
[3:55:22.480 --> 3:55:25.480]  we're not going to penalize people that haven't gotten it yet
[3:55:25.480 --> 3:55:28.480]  because for whatever reason they can't afford it.
[3:55:28.480 --> 3:55:31.480]  And I also found Sean Spicer to be refreshing
[3:55:31.480 --> 3:55:33.480]  as the press secretary as well.
[3:55:33.480 --> 3:55:35.480]  I don't know if you guys caught any of his stuff
[3:55:35.480 --> 3:55:38.480]  between the reporters going toe-to-toe with them.
[3:55:38.480 --> 3:55:40.480]  This is going to...
[3:55:40.480 --> 3:55:43.480]  We're living in some really weird times, so I got to say.
[3:55:43.480 --> 3:55:46.480]  I just, who knows what the future holds? Looks bright, though.
[3:55:46.480 --> 3:55:49.480]  Well, and I'll tell you what, that video clip,
[3:55:49.480 --> 3:55:51.480]  I actually still have not had the chance to listen
[3:55:51.480 --> 3:55:54.480]  to the entire inauguration speech from Donald Trump, believe it or not.
[3:55:54.480 --> 3:55:55.480]  Hey, what?
[3:55:55.480 --> 3:55:57.480]  I know. Well, that's just what it's like when you're on the road.
[3:55:57.480 --> 3:55:59.480]  It's really good when you're trying to tear it apart
[3:55:59.480 --> 3:56:00.480]  as if it's this...
[3:56:00.480 --> 3:56:02.480]  When you're coming to Hitler.
[3:56:02.480 --> 3:56:05.480]  That clip, that clip I was listening earlier,
[3:56:05.480 --> 3:56:07.480]  that clip that you guys played when he talks about the future
[3:56:07.480 --> 3:56:10.480]  and the medical, the mysteries of space,
[3:56:10.480 --> 3:56:12.480]  I actually cried.
[3:56:12.480 --> 3:56:17.480]  I actually cried because humanity has so much potential, folks.
[3:56:17.480 --> 3:56:20.480]  I mean, we really can release our potential,
[3:56:20.480 --> 3:56:23.480]  and we've never had a leader that's called that out,
[3:56:23.480 --> 3:56:25.480]  that's wanted to bring that to the forefront.
[3:56:25.480 --> 3:56:27.480]  Right, he's giving people hope again,
[3:56:27.480 --> 3:56:29.480]  the hope and change that we were hoping for
[3:56:29.480 --> 3:56:32.480]  when we elected Barack Obama,
[3:56:32.480 --> 3:56:34.480]  those of us who voted for him the first time.
[3:56:34.480 --> 3:56:37.480]  Honestly, Trump is going to be that change.
[3:56:37.480 --> 3:56:41.480]  He's bringing a total new perspective to America,
[3:56:41.480 --> 3:56:44.480]  and he's really waking people up in so many different ways.
[3:56:44.480 --> 3:56:46.480]  Hope and change, bringing it to the people,
[3:56:46.480 --> 3:56:50.480]  rather than just Obama's administration was for a select few.
[3:56:50.480 --> 3:56:51.480]  Exactly.
[3:56:51.480 --> 3:56:53.480]  And he's not going to keep the people asleep.
[3:56:53.480 --> 3:56:57.480]  He's going to tell it like it is to the best of his ability.
[3:56:57.480 --> 3:57:00.480]  He's not going to, I think, hold too many punches.
[3:57:00.480 --> 3:57:02.480]  He's not going to be politically correct.
[3:57:02.480 --> 3:57:04.480]  And that's the kind of rhetoric, I think,
[3:57:04.480 --> 3:57:05.480]  well, at least that I like,
[3:57:05.480 --> 3:57:08.480]  because that's what takes America out of its trance.
[3:57:08.480 --> 3:57:09.480]  That's what we need.
[3:57:09.480 --> 3:57:11.480]  Yeah, exactly. You don't need a president
[3:57:11.480 --> 3:57:13.480]  that's going to go up there and NPR you,
[3:57:13.480 --> 3:57:16.480]  or beat around the bush, or semantics,
[3:57:16.480 --> 3:57:18.480]  or just flat out lie.
[3:57:18.480 --> 3:57:21.480]  I mean, let's call it like it is, flat out lie.
[3:57:21.480 --> 3:57:22.480]  Donald Trump to me is not going to do that.
[3:57:22.480 --> 3:57:24.480]  Now, of course, like you guys said,
[3:57:24.480 --> 3:57:25.480]  the media is going to spin it.
[3:57:25.480 --> 3:57:27.480]  In fact, they're already all over him.
[3:57:27.480 --> 3:57:29.480]  I've got this story here.
[3:57:29.480 --> 3:57:32.480]  CNBC, Yahoo, they're attacking.
[3:57:32.480 --> 3:57:33.480]  I'm not even going to give it any time.
[3:57:33.480 --> 3:57:37.480]  Well, it's so interesting because when I went to the Bilderberg there
[3:57:37.480 --> 3:57:39.480]  with Alex Jones and everyone when I first started working here,
[3:57:39.480 --> 3:57:41.480]  and he went on the BBC,
[3:57:41.480 --> 3:57:44.480]  and this was shortly after he also, you know,
[3:57:44.480 --> 3:57:46.480]  got into it with Piers Morgan and was just so loud,
[3:57:46.480 --> 3:57:48.480]  and he did the same kind of...
[3:57:48.480 --> 3:57:50.480]  All of a sudden he's coming around on Trump, by the way.
[3:57:50.480 --> 3:57:52.480]  Come on the show, Piers Morgan.
[3:57:52.480 --> 3:57:53.480]  Come talk to Alex.
[3:57:53.480 --> 3:57:54.480]  Come back around.
[3:57:54.480 --> 3:57:55.480]  Come talk to Alex again.
[3:57:55.480 --> 3:57:56.480]  Yeah, come on.
[3:57:56.480 --> 3:57:57.480]  We won't talk about guns.
[3:57:57.480 --> 3:57:58.480]  We'll just talk about Trump.
[3:57:58.480 --> 3:58:02.480]  That's what Alex said is that these people are in such a trance
[3:58:02.480 --> 3:58:04.480]  that you have to speak to them like that
[3:58:04.480 --> 3:58:06.480]  so that they wake up out of their trance.
[3:58:06.480 --> 3:58:08.480]  You have to speak to them in that way.
[3:58:08.480 --> 3:58:09.480]  He's so right.
[3:58:09.480 --> 3:58:12.480]  Well, Trumpledore with his magic Jobs Wand is at it again.
[3:58:12.480 --> 3:58:16.480]  Foxconn CEO says investment for display plant in U.S.
[3:58:16.480 --> 3:58:17.480]  would exceed $7 billion.
[3:58:17.480 --> 3:58:18.480]  Wow.
[3:58:18.480 --> 3:58:20.480]  And I hope that they would build that plant without suicide nets
[3:58:20.480 --> 3:58:21.480]  like they do in China.
[3:58:21.480 --> 3:58:25.480]  Supermarket chain Kroger fills 10,000 permanent positions.
[3:58:25.480 --> 3:58:29.480]  And this is not something that necessarily can be deemed Trump's making,
[3:58:29.480 --> 3:58:32.480]  but people are trying to promote this America first.
[3:58:32.480 --> 3:58:33.480]  We're bringing jobs back.
[3:58:33.480 --> 3:58:34.480]  Put America back to work.
[3:58:34.480 --> 3:58:36.480]  This has been the Alex Jones Show.
[3:58:36.480 --> 3:58:38.480]  Lee Ann Macken, Ashley Beckford, Alex Jones, Owen Schroder.
[3:58:38.480 --> 3:58:39.480]  Thank you guys so much.
