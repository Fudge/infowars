[00:00.000 --> 00:13.280]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.280 --> 00:22.040]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.040 --> 00:33.200]  we are live on this Friday the 11th day of December 2009 and out of the gates we
[00:33.200 --> 00:38.200]  are simulcasting the full four hours of this Friday radio show live and living
[00:38.200 --> 00:44.720]  color the television at prisonplanet.tv congressman Ron Paul is scheduled to
[00:44.720 --> 00:50.900]  join us in the next segment but they are voting today up on Capitol Hill so that
[00:50.900 --> 00:58.040]  may fluctuate it does routinely when he is on Capitol Hill you know I've talked
[00:58.040 --> 01:04.640]  for years about how the global government plan is only the beginning the
[01:04.640 --> 01:07.800]  United Nations documents the Club of Rome documents Council on Foreign
[01:07.800 --> 01:11.840]  Relations State Department memorandums biological diversity assessments
[01:11.840 --> 01:17.920]  hundreds of government funded textbooks call for a planetary regime that's a
[01:17.920 --> 01:24.280]  quote planetary police state government that's a quote planetary dictatorship
[01:24.280 --> 01:30.080]  that's a quote to carry out eugenics this is what makes the whole world tick
[01:30.080 --> 01:34.560]  it's why the license plate reading cameras are going in it's why the CPS is
[01:34.560 --> 01:38.760]  interrogating all of your children and training them to spy on you it's why the
[01:38.760 --> 01:43.800]  family is under attack it's why our industrial society has been deindustrialized
[01:43.800 --> 01:48.680]  by design publicly announced by the United Nations and we're now going into
[01:48.680 --> 01:55.080]  the next deeper phase of this the Chinese government officially yesterday in
[01:55.080 --> 01:59.880]  the largest paper in the country and at the Copenhagen summit called for a
[01:59.880 --> 02:06.960]  planetary regime to force a one-child policy to begin with simultaneously
[02:06.960 --> 02:12.720]  papers across the world TV news networks and others called for a one-child
[02:12.720 --> 02:18.120]  policy to cut the carbon footprint the deadly carbon dioxide now listed as a
[02:18.120 --> 02:24.320]  chemical toxin even though plants breathe it humans exhale it and so we're
[02:24.320 --> 02:27.320]  going to be going over the latest on climategate the latest on the
[02:27.320 --> 02:31.400]  establishment of world government and what this world's going to look like if
[02:31.400 --> 02:39.920]  these people succeed and I want to break down the phases of control it just has
[02:39.920 --> 02:44.160]  really hit me hard again last night this morning how serious this is how dire
[02:44.160 --> 02:49.800]  this is how criminal and and and just viciously controlling and selfish the
[02:49.800 --> 02:56.880]  planetary controllers and their minions are we need to have a call to arms
[02:56.880 --> 03:02.640]  peaceably in the info war a call to the info war to really call these people out
[03:02.640 --> 03:05.880]  for what they are bloodthirsty killers they're already killing people all over
[03:05.880 --> 03:09.880]  the planet thanks to starvation and cutting off water supplies and I wanted
[03:09.880 --> 03:17.800]  to tell their plan today after congressman Ron Paul leaves us of course
[03:17.800 --> 03:22.600]  Bob Chapman will give us his once a week visit on the economy as well as he does
[03:22.600 --> 03:27.800]  every Friday for part of the third hour will also have open phones later in the
[03:27.800 --> 03:34.280]  broadcast they're not open yet but here is the mainstream news article China
[03:34.280 --> 03:39.560]  daily that's their big paper government paper population control called key to
[03:39.560 --> 03:46.280]  deal China says they'll sign on if the new planetary government implements a
[03:46.280 --> 03:56.240]  one child policy so we're going to be going over that after we come back also
[03:56.240 --> 04:01.200]  the national post out of Canada says the real inconvenient truth the whole
[04:01.200 --> 04:05.040]  world needs to adopt China's one child policy scores of other papers are
[04:05.040 --> 04:11.720]  announcing children are evil carbon blobs and of course a bc news is
[04:11.720 --> 04:15.400]  reporting that children are being taught in public schools under a u n program
[04:15.400 --> 04:20.520]  with UNESCO when they should die that their carbon credits run out at age
[04:20.520 --> 04:25.720]  11 and of course the national ID card under treaty will keep a tally of your
[04:25.720 --> 04:29.640]  carbon credits so that is all going into place we're going to go to a quick
[04:29.640 --> 04:34.880]  break we have congressman Ron Paul on the line with us from Washington and we'll
[04:34.880 --> 04:40.080]  go directly to congressman Ron Paul on a host of issues government takeover of

[05:17.240 --> 05:21.280]  first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs
[05:21.280 --> 05:26.040]  generator infuses the respiratory system with yourself produced nano silver
[05:26.040 --> 05:31.160]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the blood
[05:31.160 --> 05:35.240] stream with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver
[05:35.240 --> 05:39.960]  products you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the
[05:39.960 --> 05:44.240]  silver lungs generator very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are

[06:04.880 --> 06:09.880]  last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're
[06:09.880 --> 06:13.680]  finishing off this agenda that we pulling the rug from underneath the
[06:13.680 --> 06:17.840]  Americans at home have tremendous influence on our president in
[06:17.840 --> 06:22.960]  Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of
[06:22.960 --> 06:27.960]  us as American citizens to pay attention fall of the Republic identifies the
[06:27.960 --> 06:32.760]  enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying

[08:05.800 --> 08:13.680]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[08:13.680 --> 08:21.200]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[08:21.200 --> 08:27.680]  Alex Jones okay we've got him until the bottom of the hour unless the bell rings
[08:27.680 --> 08:34.040]  and there's a vote at 1230 Eastern we've got Ron Paul for the next 20 minutes I
[08:34.040 --> 08:40.560]  want to first play a clip for the congressman of the Herman von Rompuy the
[08:40.560 --> 08:45.840]  head of the EU saying that the carbon tax and this a treaty will be the birth
[08:45.840 --> 08:50.640]  of world governance and then I want to play Al Gore saying the same thing and
[08:50.640 --> 08:54.560]  get the congressman's take out of the gates on that subject here is the new
[08:54.560 --> 08:59.240]  head of the EU nine is also the first year of global governance with the
[08:59.240 --> 09:04.080]  establishment of the G20 in the middle of the financial crisis the climate
[09:04.080 --> 09:09.520]  conference in Copenhagen is another step towards the global management of our
[09:09.520 --> 09:14.680]  planet okay and he goes on for many minutes after that here's Al Gore
[09:14.680 --> 09:20.080]  saying that environmentalism is the key to global governance here is Al Gore
[09:20.080 --> 09:27.400]  vice-performer vice-president Al Gore but it is the awareness itself that will
[09:27.400 --> 09:32.680]  drive the change and one of the ways it will drive the change is through global
[09:32.680 --> 09:37.400]  governance and global okay payments congressman for 30 years you've warned
[09:37.400 --> 09:42.000]  of global government reading their own documents I have the Danish text leaked
[09:42.000 --> 09:46.760]  of the treaty calling for global governance a global authority over all
[09:46.760 --> 09:52.840]  air travel over the oceans 2% tax flat tax on all GDPs paid to the IMF and
[09:52.840 --> 09:57.720]  World Bank effectively abolishing the UN's power the UN is freaking out
[09:57.720 --> 10:02.440]  private corporate global governance congressman there's no longer any
[10:02.440 --> 10:08.200]  denial about this is there no way and in a way it may serve to our benefit
[10:08.200 --> 10:12.280]  because the people are going to wake up just as our federal government fails you
[10:12.280 --> 10:17.360]  know we hear more about nullification and secession and I figure that when the
[10:17.360 --> 10:20.080]  federal government fails or the money fails there's going to be a lot of
[10:20.080 --> 10:23.880]  independence declared so even though they're bold and they're making these
[10:23.880 --> 10:29.480]  plans they're not going to be effective and it may serve our purpose in waking
[10:29.480 --> 10:33.940]  waking up the people but they've been pushing this for a good many years but
[10:33.940 --> 10:37.800]  you know 20 years ago approximately when you know the Soviet system collapsed
[10:37.800 --> 10:41.680]  they quit using the word socialism but they shifted over toward this
[10:41.680 --> 10:45.960]  environmental effort claiming that they could get government control through
[10:45.960 --> 10:51.680]  through this and they have done a amazing job in infiltrating our public
[10:51.680 --> 10:55.480]  school system and indoctrinating our young kids and young kids going home
[10:55.480 --> 10:59.760]  and talking and yelling at their parents and for environmental things and
[10:59.760 --> 11:05.760]  pollution and all this so they have invaded us but hopefully we can survive
[11:05.760 --> 11:11.400]  and be motivated enough to counteract these these efforts and and you know
[11:11.400 --> 11:15.240]  making clear the world government is to no one's benefit except those who
[11:15.240 --> 11:18.760]  get to govern the others I've interviewed literally hundreds of
[11:18.760 --> 11:21.840]  reporters that have been at these different globalist summits including
[11:21.840 --> 11:25.080]  five or six the last few days of Copenhagen and they say that there's a
[11:25.080 --> 11:29.960]  sense of desperation and panic by the big banks predominantly that are funding
[11:29.960 --> 11:35.280]  this this private corporate global government sir do you agree with me or
[11:35.280 --> 11:38.240]  perhaps you can elaborate on the fact that now that they've been revealed
[11:38.240 --> 11:41.880]  because we did our job in the face of ridicule and expose their global
[11:41.880 --> 11:45.800]  government plan that now because they've been exposed they're coming out in the
[11:45.800 --> 11:49.800]  open and being more bold and honest about it I mean what's your take on why
[11:49.800 --> 11:54.640]  they're so bold well I think that could be it they have to be more aggressive but
[11:54.640 --> 11:59.800]  in many in many ways though people are backing off from this because they're
[11:59.800 --> 12:05.480]  you know some major candidates had been you know support supporters of trade
[12:05.480 --> 12:09.440]  cap and trade and have taken their names off the bill so they're starting to
[12:09.440 --> 12:15.080]  understand this same way with you know audit the Fed thing you know just look
[12:15.080 --> 12:18.960]  how the establishment come down hard and Bernanke hiring lobbyists and him
[12:18.960 --> 12:23.240]  writing editorials it hasn't seemed to help their side they're still on the
[12:23.240 --> 12:27.400]  defensive but we are in a struggle there is no doubt and they are going to get
[12:27.400 --> 12:31.600]  tougher and right now too many of them have too much power in different
[12:31.600 --> 12:35.600]  governments and if they take this next step that they can exert power with a
[12:35.600 --> 12:41.440]  world government and a world military which is partially here already then
[12:41.440 --> 12:46.760]  we're in very big trouble but I tend to want to be more optimistic thinking that
[12:46.760 --> 12:50.920]  the people will wake up and we have the tools still of the radio hopefully that
[12:50.920 --> 12:55.280]  will last and still we have the internet hopefully that'll last but but they're
[12:55.280 --> 13:00.640]  capable of closing us down so this is it is vital that we wake up as many people
[13:00.640 --> 13:04.360]  as possible as quickly as possible congressman you brought up the fact
[13:04.360 --> 13:08.280]  that the Senate is now saying they're probably not going to ratify the treaty
[13:08.280 --> 13:12.560]  even if Obama signs it that may be a red herring to make us stand down but then
[13:12.560 --> 13:17.000]  it looks like it may be real because as you know Obama two days ago was in the
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.600]  Associated Press headline Obama threatens command and control and tells
[13:21.600 --> 13:27.360]  Congress the real boss in our system of government the three three pillars of
[13:27.360 --> 13:31.280]  government legislative executive judicial saying I don't care if you don't
[13:31.280 --> 13:37.240]  pass this the EPA is gonna implement this by executive fiat yeah and that goes
[13:37.240 --> 13:41.240]  to show what they can do you know on the system that we've allowed to be
[13:41.240 --> 13:45.520]  created you know the executive branch has tremendous powers and the courts won't
[13:45.520 --> 13:50.240]  help us they write regulations they have the force of law and it reminds me of
[13:50.240 --> 13:54.720]  that statement stroke of the pen law of the land kind of cool and that's how
[13:54.720 --> 13:59.320]  powerful presence are they write executive orders they write signing
[13:59.320 --> 14:05.440]  statements and they do what they want and this is why the movement is is getting
[14:05.440 --> 14:09.760]  very very disgusted and saying you know they keep talking about
[14:09.760 --> 14:15.760]  nullification and secession and and that growth is going to continue congressman
[14:15.760 --> 14:22.120]  is it not an impeachable offense to have the White House telling Congress if
[14:22.120 --> 14:26.560]  you don't ratify a treaty handing our control over to the IMF and World Bank
[14:26.560 --> 14:30.400]  now in the treaty for all of these unlimited taxes they say they have the
[14:30.400 --> 14:34.840]  power to just raise any taxes they want selectively enforce regulations to the
[14:34.840 --> 14:40.040]  benefit of that inner coterie of global robber barons I mean is this not an
[14:40.040 --> 14:47.160]  impeachable offense if Obama attempts to supersede the will of the Congress well
[14:47.160 --> 14:50.760]  it certainly deserves a lot of attention I don't know whether it's going to be
[14:50.760 --> 14:53.800]  put in that category it's not going to happen because they've been doing it for
[14:53.800 --> 14:59.280]  so long it means that you know everybody in the Congress is guilty you know
[14:59.280 --> 15:01.920]  everybody in the executive branch is guilty and just about everybody in this
[15:01.920 --> 15:09.560]  judicial system is guilty so so that's not going to happen and I I guess to
[15:09.560 --> 15:14.160]  many of it is a high crime and it should be looked at but that's that's not
[15:14.160 --> 15:19.040]  going to happen that's not I mean we have to just change the understanding by
[15:19.040 --> 15:24.920]  more and more people on what we have to replace what we have right now well how
[15:24.920 --> 15:29.640]  do we block it then how do we block a president acting as a dictator under
[15:29.640 --> 15:33.840]  presidential decision directive 51 and others saying I'll do whatever I want
[15:33.840 --> 15:38.760]  I'll hand America over to the United Nations and IMF and World Bank well if
[15:38.760 --> 15:43.800]  they get to that point where you know it's literally so right now they would
[15:43.800 --> 15:48.600]  argue the case against that but you know I think that suddenly we're we're moving
[15:48.600 --> 15:54.440]  in that direction but but this would all stop if if we had the right numbers
[15:54.440 --> 15:59.080]  this Congress would be eliminated and we'd have different people here and they
[15:59.080 --> 16:04.320]  would be passing legislation and then if the public was you know on our side then
[16:04.320 --> 16:07.440]  the president couldn't do it just because of public pressure the president
[16:07.440 --> 16:12.640]  isn't going to march next weekend and take your gun he might like to and he
[16:12.640 --> 16:15.160]  might be moving in that direction but he's not going to do it there's a limit
[16:15.160 --> 16:20.400]  public opinion is not going to let that happen so public opinion is what really
[16:20.400 --> 16:25.200]  really counts and puts up the resistance you know to what they're doing and we're
[16:25.200 --> 16:31.120]  moving in that direction and it's much better but it won't be a technical
[16:31.120 --> 16:36.720]  matter of of throwing the president out for it for this is that there's not the
[16:36.720 --> 16:41.040]  mentality here in Washington isn't even considering anything like that the
[16:41.040 --> 16:44.120]  American people have to change the nature of Congress before anything else will
[16:44.120 --> 16:48.960]  happen but you do sound optimistic I mean I'm seeing a giant awakening that
[16:48.960 --> 16:53.840]  just continues to mushroom and accelerate exponentially are you seeing the
[16:53.840 --> 16:58.320]  same thing from your position sir oh yeah I think this every time I go out I
[16:58.320 --> 17:03.600]  get more encouraged and you know I do go to the campus and talk to young people
[17:03.600 --> 17:09.120]  because I think that's so crucial and I think real revolutions occur with young
[17:09.120 --> 17:13.680]  people so I see it not only with college kids but even kids younger that are
[17:13.680 --> 17:17.280]  getting interested in their their reading they're so far ahead of what I
[17:17.280 --> 17:21.120]  was thinking about when I was in college I was doing pre-med and you know that's
[17:21.120 --> 17:25.440]  what I was concentrating on but now I have a lot of college kids and high school
[17:25.440 --> 17:28.800]  kids coming in and they're intensely interested in their interest in the
[17:28.800 --> 17:32.720]  Federal Reserve and their study and their reading Austrian economics and so
[17:32.720 --> 17:38.520]  their numbers are growing and that's what we have to encourage because I see
[17:38.520 --> 17:42.440]  it as an ideological struggle rather than a political struggle the political
[17:42.440 --> 17:47.400]  stuff comes if you convince enough people that it's in their best interest to
[17:47.400 --> 17:51.440]  get rid of the government you know and get rid of the monetary absolutely that's
[17:51.440 --> 17:56.520]  the source foreign policy so it's an ideological struggle it's that to me is
[17:56.520 --> 18:00.560]  the most important absolutely and so it we are starting to gain ground on that
[18:00.560 --> 18:05.280]  front lastly on the environment front China is saying they will support the
[18:05.280 --> 18:10.080]  Copenhagen establishment of world government if a global government this
[18:10.080 --> 18:16.280]  is out of China daily will carry out one-child policies in the west and we
[18:16.280 --> 18:20.360]  have the national post calling for that the good news is there are hundreds of
[18:20.360 --> 18:24.600]  comments on this national post article out of Canada not one of them is in
[18:24.600 --> 18:28.720]  support of these Malthusian control freak views but from my studies
[18:28.720 --> 18:34.200]  congressman at the heart of the global government is a control freak wish to
[18:34.200 --> 18:39.920]  establish a neo Malthusian eugenics system on the planet can you comment on
[18:39.920 --> 18:43.200]  the call I think the radical environmentalist would go along with
[18:43.200 --> 18:46.840]  that but they're in a small minority they're losing credibility American
[18:46.840 --> 18:52.600]  people aren't going to buy into this so I think it's it's fine for them to make
[18:52.600 --> 18:57.000]  this a those announcements because I think that's a awakening that will serve
[18:57.000 --> 19:02.360]  to awaken the people because that is so extreme and so radical and so on
[19:02.360 --> 19:07.800]  American if we don't wake up but then it's our own darn fault you know if
[19:07.800 --> 19:13.960]  absolutely talk and then go ahead and sign these treaties and then find out
[19:13.960 --> 19:17.560]  there's a world government trying to enforce these things I mean they there
[19:17.560 --> 19:22.640]  are movements for world governments to regulate guns and everything else so
[19:22.640 --> 19:29.600]  that I mean if we get that far yeah you know we almost deserve it if if we're
[19:29.600 --> 19:33.960]  so stupid is not to not to wake up and do something about it well congressman
[19:33.960 --> 19:37.280]  Ron Paul is our guest we have the full text of the treaty and the Danish
[19:37.280 --> 19:42.120]  Addendum it states that it is a global government a regulatory system over all
[19:42.120 --> 19:48.920]  air traffic 2% tax on all the GDP off the top huge taxes on fuels taxes on
[19:48.920 --> 19:53.920]  meat taxes on methane taxes on light bulbs television sets free on I mean
[19:53.920 --> 19:59.800]  this is tens of trillions of dollars a year to the IMF and World Bank yeah
[19:59.800 --> 20:06.440]  that's that's grandiose I just don't think it's going to happen because the
[20:06.440 --> 20:10.600]  people will rebel and that will be a tremendous boost to the underground
[20:10.600 --> 20:14.240]  economy you know they they're just they're just not going to do with you
[20:14.240 --> 20:17.200]  now hey the underground economy is growing all the time our own our own
[20:17.200 --> 20:21.200]  government does it to us our own local governments do these things to us is too
[20:21.200 --> 20:25.040]  much regulation too much taxation too much abuse of our freedoms and people are
[20:25.040 --> 20:28.920]  so sick and tired of it if all of a sudden they see on some bill someplace
[20:28.920 --> 20:33.840]  that their taxes are going up to pay for world government it's just going to
[20:33.840 --> 20:40.600]  it's just going to incense them and survival comes from you know ignoring
[20:40.600 --> 20:45.440]  the burden of big government and when the and when the government system
[20:45.440 --> 20:49.600]  breaks down you know if and I'm I believe that breaking down comes when the
[20:49.600 --> 20:53.640]  dollar quit functioning and that's still a couple years off but when it when it
[20:53.640 --> 20:57.360]  comes people have to survive and they're going to survive without begging and
[20:57.360 --> 21:01.600]  pleading and bowing to the federal government or the United Nations and
[21:01.600 --> 21:05.920]  meanwhile congressman the USA Today reports seventy seven thousand dollars a
[21:05.920 --> 21:10.240]  year on average for government employees they're all getting big pay increases
[21:10.240 --> 21:14.240]  they're more police outriding tickets governments growing like a cancer and
[21:14.240 --> 21:18.920]  celebrating the fact that it's taking control of the economy I want to just
[21:18.920 --> 21:23.240]  get a final comment on the climategate emails where they're hiding the decline
[21:23.240 --> 21:29.160]  the head climber climate research center in collusion to defraud the public are
[21:29.160 --> 21:32.120]  you calling for a congressional investigation a senator in office
[21:32.120 --> 21:37.440]  well I would certainly support it I haven't particularly done this sometimes
[21:37.440 --> 21:42.240]  investigations are used to cover up things and I don't get all that excited
[21:42.240 --> 21:46.760]  about them getting to the source of it the source that the the answers for this
[21:46.760 --> 21:50.360]  and the source will be outside of Washington Washington is not going to
[21:50.360 --> 21:57.320]  very often give you the the truth if if we have a chance to do that fine and
[21:57.320 --> 22:01.200]  dandy but it says that some of the stuff is overseas there's a limit to
[22:01.200 --> 22:05.000]  finding out you know all the information that you have to have but we've
[22:05.000 --> 22:09.840]  benefited tremendously by this this exposure so wasn't the government that
[22:09.840 --> 22:13.880]  told us what was going on and now this information is out and the numbers are
[22:13.880 --> 22:18.920]  shifting people are now much more reluctant to go along with some of
[22:18.920 --> 22:23.320]  this so the resistance is building so we're already benefiting by yes and now
[22:23.320 --> 22:26.480]  more fraud is pouring out of universities globally they're being
[22:26.480 --> 22:30.880]  caught and more whistleblowers are coming forward on the subject of the
[22:30.880 --> 22:36.000]  peace prize Obama has had two big troops surges now in Afghanistan keeping the
[22:36.000 --> 22:40.960]  troops in Iraq going back on his promise there your take a congressman Ron
[22:40.960 --> 22:46.000]  Paul on Obama I mean this is Orwellian war is now now peace perhaps we should
[22:46.000 --> 22:52.360]  give Genghis Khan a Nobel Peace Prize posthumously yeah one part of that
[22:52.360 --> 22:58.520]  speech that really annoyed me was that he talked he described as being a just
[22:58.520 --> 23:04.600]  war harping back to the Christian just war theory and for him to try to claim
[23:04.600 --> 23:09.320]  that he's falling just war theory which was originally Christian Christian
[23:09.320 --> 23:15.280]  oriented is so far removed from reality and of course he claims as one of his
[23:15.280 --> 23:21.440]  heroes it's Gandhi who really believed in peace and so it is so hypocritical but
[23:21.440 --> 23:28.400]  the you know the fact that the American people don't seem to be catching on for
[23:28.400 --> 23:32.480]  this unfortunately for a while they're going to support more troops over there
[23:32.480 --> 23:36.160]  although our numbers are starting to build and we're doing more right now
[23:36.160 --> 23:41.280]  here in the Congress to try to call more attention to this the percentage and a
[23:41.280 --> 23:46.280]  few of us have introduced legislation that will challenge the way his whole
[23:46.280 --> 23:50.560]  effort over there including the Bush effort under the war powers resolution
[23:50.560 --> 23:55.000]  because you know even though he got some authority after 9-11 it wasn't the kind
[23:55.000 --> 23:59.400]  of authority that they had been using for these eight years to occupy and take
[23:59.400 --> 24:03.400]  over the whole government the whole country absolutely Congressman as you
[24:03.400 --> 24:10.000]  know the polls show the war is at an all-time unpopularity level and so
[24:10.000 --> 24:13.840]  certainly people are waking up to that and this is really blown up in their
[24:13.840 --> 24:21.280]  face giving him a peace prize shifting gears into government-run healthcare are
[24:21.280 --> 24:26.800]  we in danger of this power grab taking place yeah that one I'm always looking
[24:26.800 --> 24:31.760]  for a place for optimism I guess I'm less optimistic about anything decent
[24:31.760 --> 24:35.720]  coming out of the healthcare I think it I think it's going to get worse we will
[24:35.720 --> 24:40.120]  the people in this country accept incrementalism medical care is seen
[24:40.120 --> 24:44.080]  somewhat different they don't see that the same principles of a liberty applied
[24:44.080 --> 24:46.840]  to medical care as they do to their second amendment and their first
[24:46.840 --> 24:49.440]  amendment right so you I mean you think health there's going to pass this
[24:49.440 --> 24:53.320]  thing stand right now yeah to some degree whether they keep all this on and
[24:53.320 --> 24:56.240]  they're not going to get total control but they're going to have more control
[24:56.240 --> 25:00.560]  the quality of health care is going to quarter million dollar fines five years
[25:00.560 --> 25:05.600]  in prison 41 billion dollar cut to Medicare I mean how is that liberal
[25:05.600 --> 25:11.800]  yeah that's that's pretty bad and then then the the the other the other big
[25:11.800 --> 25:16.480]  thing that I imagined by the time the death settle they will undermine the
[25:16.480 --> 25:20.640]  ability to get a medical savings account because right now if you really want to
[25:20.640 --> 25:25.320]  take care of yourself you can go out and get a medical savings account pay for
[25:25.320 --> 25:28.720]  all your local bills your doctor bills and put money in savings can't get a
[25:28.720 --> 25:33.240]  tax benefit from this if if no matter what they did if that was available to
[25:33.240 --> 25:37.560]  the people where they had the chance to just walk away from the system but this
[25:37.560 --> 25:41.840]  crowd up here now is not interested in protecting your right they want control
[25:41.840 --> 25:45.120]  over people don't they yeah it's the same way you know Medicare even though
[25:45.120 --> 25:50.240]  with those medical savings accounts we're are a good idea if you're 65 or
[25:50.240 --> 25:53.080]  over and you're in Medicare you don't have a choice of that so they they
[25:53.080 --> 25:57.280]  started by mandating everybody be in it because they need your money and there's
[25:57.280 --> 26:02.360]  gonna be a lot more of that so I am I'm not I can't find room for optimism
[26:02.360 --> 26:05.920]  about what's happening in the medical care well that is devastating news from
[26:05.920 --> 26:09.800]  one of the only medical doctors in Congress and an economist award-winning
[26:09.800 --> 26:13.800]  congressman Ron Paul telling us that it looks like it's gonna pass folks you
[26:13.800 --> 26:17.560]  better do whatever you can to stop this and let Harry read now there's no they're
[26:17.560 --> 26:20.960]  not going to get reelected if they do this in closing congressman some good
[26:20.960 --> 26:26.280]  news you got 311 sponsors it's passed out a committee audit the Fed the feds
[26:26.280 --> 26:30.440]  admitted you wanted us you'll destroy us in the last three minutes we've got
[26:30.440 --> 26:35.720]  left sir auditing the Fed give us a report on that okay I think most know
[26:35.720 --> 26:40.720]  that last week it was put into a bank regular regulation bill which is a
[26:40.720 --> 26:44.320]  monster of a bill when it came out of the committee I voted against the bill
[26:44.320 --> 26:47.560]  because I don't vote for a few good things when there's a lot of bad things
[26:47.560 --> 26:53.720]  in it but my amendment one by 42 to 26 which was a major victory it's on the
[26:53.720 --> 26:58.360]  high floor at this moment it will be voted on at the end of the day and the
[26:58.360 --> 27:02.400]  auditing provision was in both the Republican version and the Democratic
[27:02.400 --> 27:05.800]  version the Republic the Democratic version will pass and the auditing
[27:05.800 --> 27:09.520]  provision will be in there the real work needs to be done in the Senate so if
[27:09.520 --> 27:14.360]  anybody knows whether you know that where their senator stands try to urge
[27:14.360 --> 27:20.400]  the senators to get on that same building at 604 and there's 30 and over
[27:20.400 --> 27:25.400]  there there's been several senators that have put a hold on on Bernanke's
[27:25.400 --> 27:33.520]  reappointment unless unless they have a vote on 12 or 7 the auditing bill in
[27:33.520 --> 27:38.680]  the Senate so sir this is a massive victory I mean today it looks like
[27:38.680 --> 27:42.760]  they're gonna probably pass it in the house it'll go to the Senate and then
[27:42.760 --> 27:48.120]  the fights in the Senate this is incredible news yeah it's big if we
[27:48.120 --> 27:52.120]  have no idea you know exactly what will happen there'll be a lot more resistance
[27:52.120 --> 27:55.880]  in the Senate and the Fed still has time to do all that they do but
[27:55.880 --> 28:00.040]  nevertheless I think you're correct is describing this a major victory for the
[28:00.040 --> 28:05.160]  people you know that I mean the grassroots got this done I didn't twist
[28:05.160 --> 28:11.560]  arms I have no cloud up here in that sense but we have 313 on there all the
[28:11.560 --> 28:16.120]  Republicans and a lot of Democrats so it's really it's a really great
[28:16.120 --> 28:20.360]  testament to what can happen when the people come together because this is
[28:20.360 --> 28:25.560]  not a conservative Republican bill I mean it's liberals and populists and
[28:25.560 --> 28:29.680]  libertarians and constitutionalists have all come around to believing enough is
[28:29.680 --> 28:34.840]  enough and the Fed is too big and too secret and we finally identified it as
[28:34.840 --> 28:38.680]  the real shadow government instead of Republican and Democrat puppets you've
[28:38.680 --> 28:42.400]  been working for close to 30 years for this even if we don't have victory this
[28:42.400 --> 28:47.880]  year we're a hair away it'll be assured next year as the crisis accelerates do
[28:47.880 --> 28:52.000]  you agree with that yeah I don't think they'll be able to ever if if they
[28:52.000 --> 28:55.840]  squouch us it'll just make it a bigger issue and the problems are going to get
[28:55.840 --> 28:59.440]  worse and they will know where to look and they have to look to the Federal
[28:59.440 --> 29:03.240]  Reserve system to find a real source of our problems well Congressman I salute

[33:47.720 --> 33:52.000]  Senate doesn't pass it it is going to devastate them politically and it's
[33:52.000 --> 33:56.200]  frankly even better for us because everybody's going to say even more why
[33:56.200 --> 34:00.120]  can't we audit the Fed and everyone's going to discover that it is the real
[34:00.120 --> 34:09.560]  government now ladies and gentlemen you heard congressman Ron Paul on the day

[34:23.800 --> 34:27.920]  victory you're getting it and you hurting even if it doesn't pass the
[34:27.920 --> 34:32.960]  Senate next year it's assured these guys are in so much trouble you heard the
[34:32.960 --> 34:37.520]  bad news though they're going to snatch 17% to 20% depending on what numbers you
[34:37.520 --> 34:43.560]  look at the conservatively 17% of what's left of our free economy the social
[34:43.560 --> 34:47.560]  government health care eugenics the case for killing granting is news week
[34:47.560 --> 34:52.200]  called it is probably going to pass because they give us a tyrant like
[34:52.200 --> 34:57.560]  Bush people backlash and put in the Democrats they continue the new old
[34:57.560 --> 35:03.160]  order agenda we are in a lot of trouble but we're fighting back I'm going to
[35:03.160 --> 35:11.680]  open the phones up right now at 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 I'm
[35:11.680 --> 35:14.520]  going to take calls until eight after next hour and then I'm going to give a
[35:14.520 --> 35:19.920]  focused breakdown of the globalist master plan who they are what they are I
[35:19.920 --> 35:23.640]  normally when I break things down get stuck on little details I'm going to
[35:23.640 --> 35:28.440]  give you just a basic rundown and then zoom in on just a few facets of it I'm
[35:28.440 --> 35:32.400]  going to give you a general overview of these people and what their plan is and
[35:32.400 --> 35:37.640]  how we can beat them there is an article that just went up on prisonplanet.com
[35:37.640 --> 35:43.720]  minutes ago furious reaction to sick editorial calling for global one child
[35:43.720 --> 35:48.640]  dictatorship Francis the name of the author advocates brutal regime that
[35:48.640 --> 35:54.960]  kidnaps drugs women and carries out forced abortions in China this is a
[35:54.960 --> 36:05.160]  woman who has two children but the point is the Chinese government came out
[36:05.160 --> 36:09.240]  yesterday and said they want a global government for one child policies and
[36:09.240 --> 36:12.320]  think of how much debt we owe the Chinese think of how they're the new
[36:12.320 --> 36:17.280]  superpower the globalist chose them as the model of the planet to have prices
[36:17.280 --> 36:21.200]  so low they would bankrupt all other industry and only a select group of
[36:21.200 --> 36:27.320]  globalists can operate out of that country this is monopoly formation so
[36:27.320 --> 36:31.560]  I'm going to be going over that in the next hour but an article featured in
[36:31.560 --> 36:35.080]  Canada's financial post newspaper calling for China's draconian one child
[36:35.080 --> 36:39.040]  policy where women are kidnapped off the streets drugged and forced to
[36:39.040 --> 36:43.000]  undergo compulsory abortions to be imposed worldwide has been met with
[36:43.000 --> 36:46.760]  widespread hostile reaction yet such measures are being debated at the
[36:46.760 --> 36:52.320]  United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen to be part of the treaty now
[36:52.320 --> 36:56.480]  this morning I read it's got to be more than 50 comments I had to stop I
[36:56.480 --> 37:01.960]  couldn't read them all every comment I read every comment I read and I printed
[37:01.960 --> 37:11.120]  them off right here every comment disagreed with her and they understood
[37:11.120 --> 37:13.840]  they said we know you want a world government we know you want to sterilize
[37:13.840 --> 37:17.680]  us I mean they're admitting it she calls for a global government so does the
[37:17.680 --> 37:25.480]  official Chinese government and I have news reporters here every day and I sit
[37:25.480 --> 37:28.880]  here going you know there's a plan for a world government official government
[37:28.880 --> 37:32.560]  plans say they're spiking the water with steroids right now that's why the
[37:32.560 --> 37:35.320]  sperm counts drop over 85% in every country that
[37:35.320 --> 37:39.440]  fluoridates the water because they don't just add fluoride and they just look at
[37:39.440 --> 37:43.920]  me and start laughing and say what I guess you watch the movie Dr. Strangelove
[37:43.920 --> 37:48.920]  I guess your Jack T. Ripper the crazed general no I'm reading what the White
[37:48.920 --> 37:53.200]  House science are says they're doing there's no more time to screw around and
[37:53.200 --> 38:00.440]  play games here ladies and gentlemen all you petty bureaucrats on power trips I
[38:00.440 --> 38:09.880]  mean I've got USA Today today reporting record increases in government salaries
[38:09.880 --> 38:17.280]  nationwide you are the hired thugs that carry out this crime and you love your
[38:17.280 --> 38:22.400]  power you love all the unconstitutional power you love it don't you
[38:22.400 --> 38:26.480]  understand you're being targeted just like the rest of us can't you get that
[38:26.480 --> 38:33.280]  through your brains that Maury strong and others at the UN said they want to
[38:33.280 --> 38:37.920]  destroy our industrial society through globalization that's what Paul Ehrlich
[38:37.920 --> 38:43.160]  said that's what John P. Holdren said that's what they say over and over again
[38:43.160 --> 38:47.400]  they want to wreck the economy so government can take over and then give
[38:47.400 --> 38:51.440]  almost all of our tax money to interest on debt to private banks this is a
[38:51.440 --> 38:58.960]  criminal heist now I said I'm going to cover this next hour frankly I'm
[38:58.960 --> 39:02.440]  procrastinating it's such a monumental job I meant to write a bunch of notes up
[39:02.440 --> 39:07.760]  before I cover this I tried to start last night I had family over for a little
[39:07.760 --> 39:10.800]  Christmas party and as my children are playing in front of me I couldn't even

[41:11.600 --> 41:18.840]  America Africa and Asia my uncle and he was a helicopter pilot working in
[41:18.840 --> 41:24.120]  Latin America described orphanages he would see with just hundreds of
[41:24.120 --> 41:27.760]  children starving to death with no food for them with their ribs sticking out

[42:36.120 --> 42:40.880]  locals to inject them with vaccines on record that caused miscarriages on the

[43:03.440 --> 43:07.960]  Eric Pionk at UT that talks about how wonderful it is when airborne Ebola gets
[43:07.960 --> 43:12.840]  released to kill 90% of people I'm telling you Pionka kill yourself buddy

[43:18.800 --> 43:22.680]  brains out the back of your head but you won't because you're a cowardly ghoul
[43:22.680 --> 43:27.720]  you're a vampire you get off on thinking about people dying it makes your
[43:27.720 --> 43:37.800]  life that much sweeter you are hell spawn now I'm telling everybody out there
[43:37.800 --> 43:44.200]  get your soul lined up get your head screwed on straight if you have any
[43:44.200 --> 43:48.360]  humanity in you you should just have absolute strength welling up in you to
[43:48.360 --> 43:53.120]  crush these people in the info war literally when I think about those kids
[43:53.120 --> 43:56.520]  they're killing I guarantee you ladies and gentlemen and any man could do this
[43:56.520 --> 44:02.600]  I could take on 20 people right now because I'm in the right these little
[44:02.600 --> 44:07.560]  chicken necks couldn't take on an old lady these little wannabe control freak
[44:07.560 --> 44:12.360]  murdering supporters who support the murder of the UN cutting off people's
[44:12.360 --> 44:16.240]  resources they couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag and that's why they
[44:16.240 --> 44:21.560]  love death and evil because they think it's power they're like a moth to flame
[44:21.560 --> 44:29.800]  is that not moral is it not completely moral to tell Diane Francis the writer
[44:29.800 --> 44:34.400]  that says she wants the Chinese model of forced abortions and sterilization and
[44:34.400 --> 44:38.840]  death and pain and 50 million more Chinese men than women and record
[44:38.840 --> 44:43.880]  suicide by depressed women that can't have babies in China shouldn't she kill
[44:43.880 --> 44:49.840]  herself shouldn't she go in the garage hook up the carbon monoxide and kill
[44:49.840 --> 44:57.360]  herself big fat liberal fake yuppie oh no that's scary that's immoral for me to
[44:57.360 --> 45:03.880]  say that it's just good for her to talk about everybody else Travis County only
[45:03.880 --> 45:11.040]  county in Texas funds abortions with taxpayer money makes you pay for it they
[45:11.040 --> 45:13.960]  don't tell these poor ignorant women having kids that there's more people
[45:13.960 --> 45:20.680]  wanting to adopt children every year than there are abortions they don't tell
[45:20.680 --> 45:24.400]  these young people when Planned Parenthood pushes it on them they were
[45:24.400 --> 45:31.440]  founded by you Genesis Margaret Sanger and the Rockefeller Foundation see it's
[45:31.440 --> 45:36.880]  so moral when they I mean I I've seen three articles in Newsweek every time I
[45:36.880 --> 45:40.840]  pick it up in the last month and a half I've read it three times every time
[45:40.840 --> 45:44.480]  there's an article about how great people are committing suicide for the
[45:44.480 --> 45:48.200]  environment in fact this morning I had to run out of the house to get here I
[45:48.200 --> 45:57.280]  saw another article about committing suicide for the environment in fact
[45:57.280 --> 46:02.160]  let's do that live on screen right now go to Google or go to start page.com go
[46:02.160 --> 46:12.680]  to Google type in kill yourself for the environment and there's articles about
[46:12.680 --> 46:27.360]  how great it is to commit suicide these people are amazing now again I don't
[46:27.360 --> 46:33.640]  really want the editorialist Diane Francis to commit suicide she has two
[46:33.640 --> 46:37.600]  children though she wants by law for you not to be able to have any or only have
[46:37.600 --> 46:42.600]  one look at Ted Turner he has five children owns more houses last time I
[46:42.600 --> 46:48.560]  saw on the paper than anybody else in the country five children we know about
[46:48.560 --> 46:53.880]  but he doesn't want you to be able to have any these people are sick put her on
[46:53.880 --> 47:01.000]  screen it's up on prisonplanet.com the article is titled furious reaction to
[47:01.000 --> 47:06.920]  sick editorial calling for global one-child dictatorship we'll put that
[47:06.920 --> 47:10.600]  on screen and then while I'm talking to callers today I want you to go in and
[47:10.600 --> 47:15.800]  type starving children and then you can type vultures eating dead child here
[47:15.800 --> 47:22.720]  let's show people vultures eating dead babies this woman ought to be made to go
[47:22.720 --> 47:27.880]  to Africa and spend a month with those people dying and then oh I love what the
[47:27.880 --> 47:30.800]  yuppies always say well those Africans should just go where the food is yeah
[47:30.800 --> 47:35.200]  the globalist fund wars to push people off their land according to State
[47:35.200 --> 47:39.200]  Department memorandum 200 then they're pushed into desert areas and starved to
[47:39.200 --> 47:42.120]  death and people sit around going well they should just move where there's
[47:42.120 --> 47:48.280]  food they always counter back oh you say adopt these babies let's see you
[47:48.280 --> 47:52.600]  adopt some black or Hispanic babies did you know there are groups fighting to
[47:52.600 --> 47:59.720]  adopt those children there are people that adopt those children there's large
[47:59.720 --> 48:04.120]  groups of white Christians that adopt five six seven eight nine ten black and
[48:04.120 --> 48:07.160]  Hispanic babies that would have been aborted there's programs where they
[48:07.160 --> 48:11.600]  pay the mothers not to abort and then they fund fake liberal Hispanic and
[48:11.600 --> 48:14.680]  black groups to come and say whites shouldn't be able to save the babies
[48:14.680 --> 48:20.080]  better the babies thrown in a biohazard bag and used for genetic
[48:20.080 --> 48:28.720]  experiments better their retinas are used to grow vaccine lots better they be
[48:28.720 --> 48:35.000]  melted down and used for women's collagen injections because that's how
[48:35.000 --> 48:39.720]  you treat a black baby we're not gonna let a whitey get the kids we're gonna
[48:39.720 --> 48:46.800]  kill them just like Margaret Sanger said we've got a higher blacks we've got a
[48:46.800 --> 48:53.040]  higher blacks to go out and sell the blacks on letting us kill them and then
[48:53.040 --> 48:56.880]  when you for when you want to murder black people you get awards from the
[48:56.880 --> 49:03.600]  NAACP you get woman of the year in Time magazine but when you want to save the
[49:03.600 --> 49:10.000]  black people the ADL writes hit pieces on you saying you're a Nazi that's how
[49:10.000 --> 49:15.400]  this upside-down world works yeah there you found the vulture about to have its
[49:15.400 --> 49:18.840]  meal of the tiny child
[49:21.160 --> 49:26.520]  let's put some more starving children up on the video so that when this woman
[49:26.520 --> 49:30.640]  watches this video and no doubt she'll be sent in and no doubt you will watch it
[49:30.640 --> 49:35.400]  I know your argument well if we get rid of masses of them then this won't happen
[49:35.400 --> 49:40.480]  anymore it's the overpopulation with a weird little smiley face she has and
[49:40.480 --> 49:45.440]  looking at her picture makes me sick power trips what she's on did you know
[49:45.440 --> 49:49.720]  the Royal Commission in 49 found that the West was gonna keep the third world
[49:49.720 --> 49:53.200]  from industrializing even though that would make their numbers go down from

[54:22.480 --> 54:43.200]  take my life so I didn't what I had to do I shot the sheriff
[54:53.440 --> 55:01.200]  Steven Texas you're on the air hey hey buddy hey um I had a quick question Alex
[55:01.200 --> 55:05.880]  um since we both know that the the Catholic Church is deeply connected with
[55:05.880 --> 55:09.640]  the New World Order and that's a real problem with me because I am a Catholic
[55:09.640 --> 55:13.680]  and I was just curious if any of the other big Protestant branches like
[55:13.680 --> 55:17.960]  Lutheran Baptist Presbyterian are connected to the New World Order as well
[55:17.960 --> 55:21.560]  because I need to find a new church but I don't want to go to one of those jumpy
[55:21.560 --> 55:26.080]  feel-good churches I want to go to church that reads scripture well sir you
[55:26.080 --> 55:31.680]  know I don't sit up here on the radio judging people and and judging groups I
[55:31.680 --> 55:35.600]  go off the fruits and the facts and the last two pubs have called for a
[55:35.600 --> 55:40.280]  planetary government a one-world religion at the same time they have
[55:40.280 --> 55:47.080]  spoken out against abortion and eugenics all the major denominations have been
[55:47.080 --> 55:52.420]  financed and funded by the big banks now and they're all basically controlled the
[55:52.420 --> 55:57.400]  clergy response teams the secret FEMA program now declassified to recruit all
[55:57.400 --> 56:04.680]  the major denominations is now public and so I would I don't know I was told
[56:04.680 --> 56:08.320]  by a bunch of people about a good Baptist church in Austin Tim what's the name of
[56:08.320 --> 56:12.440]  that church you were telling me the name of a really good church that's anti New
[56:12.440 --> 56:18.720]  World Order capital city Baptist you're not in Austin though are you now but I
[56:18.720 --> 56:21.960]  used to live in Austin it's a really great place and actually just brought up
[56:21.960 --> 56:26.600]  another question because I know Austin is not a deregulated yet I know the whole
[56:26.600 --> 56:30.800]  state of Texas but I think y'all still have Austin power company whereas like
[56:30.800 --> 56:35.440]  in Houston area we have you know all sorts of different electric companies
[56:35.440 --> 56:41.320]  so and deregulation is going to be pushed and it's predicted to be you know
[56:41.320 --> 56:45.880]  one of the biggest industries in the world you know by like 2020 or something
[56:45.880 --> 56:51.880]  is that a new world New World Order agenda yes yes yes we build the
[56:51.880 --> 56:55.480]  infrastructure with our tax money they then give it to select groups that's
[56:55.480 --> 57:02.200]  why Bilderberg had Rick Perry in 2007 to Bilderberg because he handed it over to
[57:02.200 --> 57:06.280]  a Bilderberg group member I appreciate your call coming up I'm going to break
[57:06.280 --> 57:10.000]  down the whole eugenics announcement the one-child announcement from Copenhagen
[57:10.000 --> 57:15.040]  that's really the big issue here Dave in North Carolina Dave you're on the air
[57:15.040 --> 57:22.480]  welcome how you doing Alex I don't know how you do it without going nuts listen
[57:22.480 --> 57:29.160]  I wanted to comment on Dr. Paul's audit the Fed bill and it's it's just constant
[57:29.160 --> 57:38.320]  it's bothered me all along why so many of the people who have signed on to this
[57:38.320 --> 57:46.040]  bill to get it passed and I'm just I'm all for auditing the Fed and when we
[57:46.040 --> 57:52.440]  find out that the Fed is a pit of vipers they're gonna say oh maybe it's time to
[57:52.440 --> 57:56.640]  replace the Federal Reserve well then we cross that bridge when we come to it we
[57:56.640 --> 58:01.440]  give the power back to Congress there is no other group to replace whether that's
[58:01.440 --> 58:06.080]  private bankers they are the globalist and Ron Paul is good all his fruits are
[58:06.080 --> 58:10.200]  good and the way that the Federal Reserve has countered our movement to
[58:10.200 --> 58:16.440]  audit them and then abolish them with their big lobbyists they hired was to
[58:16.440 --> 58:21.520]  put that fear story out and use their operatives in the patriot movement to
[58:21.520 --> 58:26.880]  try to hamstring us but they fail so this is a good thing across the board the
[58:26.880 --> 58:33.280]  Fed has fought this tooth and nail and so we're in the process of exposing the
[58:33.280 --> 58:37.640]  real government the illegitimate banking structure we'll come back to you Dave
[58:37.640 --> 58:41.360]  let you finish up then others stay with us
[58:42.640 --> 58:52.640]  you are listening to GCN visit GCNLive.com today this is Alex Jones with
[58:52.640 --> 58:56.360]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[58:56.360 --> 59:00.160]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[59:00.160 --> 59:04.640]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[59:04.640 --> 59:08.880]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[59:08.880 --> 59:13.520]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[59:13.520 --> 59:17.480]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[59:17.480 --> 59:21.640]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[59:21.640 --> 59:25.600]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[59:25.600 --> 59:29.760]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[59:29.760 --> 59:33.560]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[59:33.560 --> 59:37.440]  power generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[59:47.760 --> 1:00:01.880]  1-H77-327-0365 waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:00:05.600 --> 1:00:13.320]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:13.320 --> 1:00:20.880]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:20.880 --> 1:00:31.600]  Alex Jones Ron Paul talked about earlier last hour how Democrats and
[1:00:31.600 --> 1:00:37.800]  Republicans on the committee the house banking committee tried to strip the
[1:00:37.800 --> 1:00:42.120]  strong provisions out of the bill but he was able to override that his strong
[1:00:42.120 --> 1:00:47.400]  clean bill is going to the house floor today and he believes it will be passed
[1:00:47.400 --> 1:00:52.320]  we're gonna re-air that key five-minute discussion we had the last five minutes
[1:00:52.320 --> 1:00:56.800]  of the interview when Bob Chapman joins us next hour so that is coming up but
[1:00:56.800 --> 1:01:02.400]  yes it's going to a full vote today going back now here in our number two that
[1:01:02.400 --> 1:01:08.960]  we just started on this Friday December 11th edition to Dave Dave what happened
[1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:12.720]  is they had all the usual suspects all the usual operatives that I've identified
[1:01:12.720 --> 1:01:17.360]  in our movement who do nothing but in fighting and stirring up trouble and
[1:01:17.360 --> 1:01:22.160]  telling us we can't win and attacking anybody who's for real they've all been
[1:01:22.160 --> 1:01:26.280]  beating the drum off the same script that oh my gosh this is a planet over the
[1:01:26.280 --> 1:01:31.720]  Federal Reserve and give us something even worse okay the Federal Reserve is
[1:01:31.720 --> 1:01:35.360]  the holding company for private banks that run the planet you expose it you
[1:01:35.360 --> 1:01:38.720]  expose the whole system sure they'll try another bait and switch once we
[1:01:38.720 --> 1:01:42.040]  audit the Fed and start dismantling them and then we've got to have that fight
[1:01:42.040 --> 1:01:47.360]  there but no the Fed did not want this audited they've done everything they can
[1:01:47.360 --> 1:01:51.560]  to stop it they're panicking they dispatched thousands of bureaucrats
[1:01:51.560 --> 1:01:55.160]  that they pay full-time to go into public schools and colleges and the city
[1:01:55.160 --> 1:02:00.280]  councils and try to brainwash people Ron Paul's for real his bills for real go
[1:02:00.280 --> 1:02:04.400]  read the bill if Ron Paul wasn't for real he would have let it pass out a
[1:02:04.400 --> 1:02:10.560]  committee stripped he didn't he beat it he made sure it stayed strong stayed
[1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:15.080]  pure and so certainly they're going to try other tricks down the road but we
[1:02:15.080 --> 1:02:20.240]  don't not go up against them because of that we've gone from maybe 5% of the
[1:02:20.240 --> 1:02:23.400]  population a decade ago knowing the private Federal Reserve was the real
[1:02:23.400 --> 1:02:31.720]  government and was a legitimate to the polls are 75 80 81 83 I've seen polls as
[1:02:31.720 --> 1:02:39.280]  high as only 17% want to keep the Fed only 21% want to keep Bernanke Americans
[1:02:39.280 --> 1:02:45.520]  now identify them as the threat and rightfully so so again more time is spent
[1:02:45.520 --> 1:02:51.600]  in the Patriot movement analyzing and in second guessing and and and making
[1:02:51.600 --> 1:02:57.160]  stuff up about Ron Paul when Ron Paul is a gentleman and a statesman and his
[1:02:57.160 --> 1:03:00.880]  fruits are the best out there you judge a tree by its fruits not what somebody
[1:03:00.880 --> 1:03:05.440]  says but what they do look at the fruits of this radio show all we do is wake
[1:03:05.440 --> 1:03:10.440]  people up all we do is fight the New World Order all we I mean most people
[1:03:10.440 --> 1:03:15.600]  that even attacked me admit I woke them up but see they then just spun out and
[1:03:15.600 --> 1:03:19.800]  got caught up and go and tell pro and are weak-minded so yes it's a good bill
[1:03:19.800 --> 1:03:23.480]  it's the beginning of the end of the bankers we're identifying them as a
[1:03:23.480 --> 1:03:27.200]  legitimate we're identifying them as the problem as the inflation tax as the
[1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:30.640]  global government they don't like this some people are trying to spend it say
[1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:35.760]  oh the climate gate emails came out for some reason why no it came out because
[1:03:35.760 --> 1:03:39.120]  somebody got sick of it and leaked them got sick of the lies that's a great
[1:03:39.120 --> 1:03:44.520]  victory the establishment does not want you to believe you can have a victory
[1:03:44.520 --> 1:03:49.160]  ladies and gentlemen they don't want you to get involved and take action they
[1:03:49.160 --> 1:03:54.080]  don't want you to believe you have power don't you understand that go ahead
[1:03:54.080 --> 1:03:58.600]  Dave slow down I'm sorry I didn't mean to disagree with them and I think it's
[1:03:58.600 --> 1:04:03.800]  all great I'm just I really just wanted to say the same thing you just said we
[1:04:03.800 --> 1:04:08.040]  got to be able when they when they audit the Fed and they say it's time to do a
[1:04:08.040 --> 1:04:13.080]  way with the Fed and we're gonna do the the New World currency I'm saying we
[1:04:13.080 --> 1:04:18.080]  got to be there to trip them and say no we see through that good listen I
[1:04:18.080 --> 1:04:22.080]  appreciate your call Dave let me just make this clear and put a put a book
[1:04:22.080 --> 1:04:28.000]  end on this the private fellow reserve bankrupted us by design last year and a
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:32.080]  stolen 23.7 trillion as of four months ago we haven't gotten new number since
[1:04:32.080 --> 1:04:38.240]  then okay they are already trading SDRs global currency bank to bank they are
[1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:42.760]  the ones killing the dollar they are bringing in the global currency people
[1:04:42.760 --> 1:04:45.480]  that say oh they want to get rid of the Fed to bring in a global currency it's
[1:04:45.480 --> 1:04:51.320]  the Fed bringing in the global currency it's the Fed killing the dollar it's
[1:04:51.320 --> 1:04:57.280]  already happening it's just a cashless system it's what's so frustrating about

[1:07:59.840 --> 1:08:07.800]  today from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the
[1:08:07.800 --> 1:08:15.280]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[1:08:15.280 --> 1:08:22.320]  government run healthcare are we in danger of this power grab taking place
[1:08:22.320 --> 1:08:27.400]  yeah that one I'm always looking for a place for optimism I guess I'm less
[1:08:27.400 --> 1:08:32.000]  optimistic about anything decent coming out of the healthcare I think it I think
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:36.720]  it's gonna get worse we will the people in this country accept incrementalism
[1:08:36.720 --> 1:08:40.720]  medical care is seen somewhat different they don't see that the same
[1:08:40.720 --> 1:08:44.040]  principles of liberty apply to medical care as they do to their second
[1:08:44.040 --> 1:08:46.640]  amendment and their first amendment right so you I mean you think health
[1:08:46.640 --> 1:08:50.000]  there's gonna pass as things stand right now yeah to some degree whether they
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:53.560]  keep all this on and they're not gonna get total control but they're gonna have
[1:08:53.560 --> 1:08:57.480]  more control the quality of health care is going to quarter million dollar
[1:08:57.480 --> 1:09:02.800]  fines five years in prison 41 billion dollar cut to Medicare I mean how is
[1:09:02.800 --> 1:09:09.840]  that liberal yeah that's pretty bad and then then the the other the other big
[1:09:09.840 --> 1:09:14.480]  thing that I imagine by the time the death settle they will undermine the
[1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:18.680]  ability to get a medical savings account because right now if you really want to
[1:09:18.680 --> 1:09:23.320]  take care of yourself you can go out and get a medical savings account pay for
[1:09:23.320 --> 1:09:26.560]  all your local bills your doctor bills and put money in the savings kind of
[1:09:26.560 --> 1:09:30.480]  get a tax benefit from this if if no matter what they did if that was
[1:09:30.480 --> 1:09:34.440]  available to the people where they had the chance to just walk away from the
[1:09:34.440 --> 1:09:38.800]  system but this crowd up here now is not interested in protecting your right
[1:09:38.800 --> 1:09:41.920]  they won't control over people don't they know it's the same way you know
[1:09:41.920 --> 1:09:47.360]  Medicare even though with those medical savings accounts were our good idea if
[1:09:47.360 --> 1:09:50.640]  you're 65 or over and you're in Medicare you don't have a choice of that so they
[1:09:50.640 --> 1:09:54.680]  they started by mandating everybody be in it because they need your money and
[1:09:54.680 --> 1:09:59.720]  there's gonna be a lot more of that so I am I'm not I can't find room for
[1:09:59.720 --> 1:10:02.800]  optimism about what's happening in the medical care movement well that is
[1:10:02.800 --> 1:10:06.800]  devastating news from one of the only medical doctors in Congress and an
[1:10:06.800 --> 1:10:10.800]  economist award-winning Congressman Ron Paul telling us that it looks like it's
[1:10:10.800 --> 1:10:14.800]  gonna pass folks you better do whatever you can to stop this and let Harry read
[1:10:14.800 --> 1:10:17.960]  and others know they're not gonna get reelected if they do this in closing
[1:10:17.960 --> 1:10:22.720]  congressman some good news you got 311 sponsors it's passed out a committee
[1:10:22.720 --> 1:10:27.440]  audit the Fed the feds admitted you wanted us you'll destroy us in the last
[1:10:27.440 --> 1:10:31.280]  three minutes we've got left sir auditing the Fed give us a report on
[1:10:31.280 --> 1:10:37.040]  that okay I think most know that last week it was put into a bank regular
[1:10:37.040 --> 1:10:41.420]  regulation bill which is a monster of a bill when it came out of the committee
[1:10:41.420 --> 1:10:44.400]  I voted against the bill because I don't vote for a few good things when
[1:10:44.400 --> 1:10:50.240]  there's a lot of bad things in it but my amendment one by 42 to 26 which was a
[1:10:50.240 --> 1:10:54.680]  major victory it's on the high floor at this moment it will be voted on at the
[1:10:54.680 --> 1:10:59.640]  end of the day and the auditing provision was in both the Republican version
[1:10:59.640 --> 1:11:03.440]  and the Democratic version the Republic the Democratic version will pass in the
[1:11:03.440 --> 1:11:07.240]  auditing provision will be in there the real work needs to be done in the Senate
[1:11:07.240 --> 1:11:12.360]  so if anybody knows whether you know where their senator stands try to urge
[1:11:12.360 --> 1:11:18.400]  the senators to get on that same bill I think it's 604 and there's 30 in over
[1:11:18.400 --> 1:11:23.400]  there there's been several senators that have put a hold on on Bernanke's
[1:11:23.400 --> 1:11:31.680]  reappointment unless unless they have a vote on 12 or 7 the auditing bill in the
[1:11:31.680 --> 1:11:37.080]  Senate so sir this is a massive victory I mean today it looks like they're going
[1:11:37.080 --> 1:11:41.400]  to probably pass it in the house it'll go to the Senate and then the fights in
[1:11:41.400 --> 1:11:47.400]  the Senate this is incredible news yeah it's big if we have no idea you know
[1:11:47.400 --> 1:11:50.960]  exactly what will happen there'll be a lot more resistance in the Senate and
[1:11:50.960 --> 1:11:55.480]  the Fed still has time to do all that they do but nevertheless I think you're
[1:11:55.480 --> 1:11:59.480]  correct is describing this a major victory for the people you know that I
[1:11:59.480 --> 1:12:04.600]  mean the grassroots got this done I didn't twist arms I have no cloud up
[1:12:04.600 --> 1:12:10.960]  here in that sense but we have 313 on there all the Republicans and a lot of
[1:12:10.960 --> 1:12:16.800]  Democrats so it's really it's a really great testament to what can happen when
[1:12:16.800 --> 1:12:20.520]  the people come together because this is not a conservative Republican bill I
[1:12:20.520 --> 1:12:25.520]  mean it's liberals and populists and libertarians and constitutions have all
[1:12:25.520 --> 1:12:30.120]  come around to believing enough is enough and the Fed is too big and too
[1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:34.760]  secret and we finally identified it as the real shadow government instead of
[1:12:34.760 --> 1:12:38.560]  Republican and Democrat puppets you've been working for close to 30 years for
[1:12:38.560 --> 1:12:43.200]  this even if we don't have victory this year we're a hair away it'll be assured
[1:12:43.200 --> 1:12:47.960]  next year as the crisis accelerates do you agree with that yeah I don't think
[1:12:47.960 --> 1:12:52.400]  they'll be able to ever if they squouch us it'll just make it a bigger issue and
[1:12:52.400 --> 1:12:56.320]  the problems are going to get worse and they will know where to look and they
[1:12:56.320 --> 1:12:59.240]  have to look to the Federal Reserve system to find a real source of our
[1:12:59.240 --> 1:13:03.480]  problems well Congressman I salute you your book is a best-seller in the Fed and
[1:13:03.480 --> 1:13:08.160]  bookstores and Amazon.com I go to campaign for Liberty.com I go to all
[1:13:08.160 --> 1:13:11.960]  the great sites of Ron Paul supporting thanking for running for president a
[1:13:11.960 --> 1:13:17.080]  few years ago that really all right ladies and gentlemen we are live it is
[1:13:17.080 --> 1:13:24.200]  Friday the 11th day of December 2009 we are now 14 minutes into the second hour
[1:13:24.200 --> 1:13:29.760]  and I just wanted to play that clip from part of our live interview with
[1:13:29.760 --> 1:13:36.160]  congressman Ron Paul last hour so they attempted to poison the bill to strip
[1:13:36.160 --> 1:13:40.680]  the strong provisions out of it Ron Paul beat that two weeks ago in the banking
[1:13:40.680 --> 1:13:46.280]  committee he was able to make sure the strong bill is going to the floor of the
[1:13:46.280 --> 1:13:53.080]  house to assuredly he believes pass today and then go to the Senate this is a
[1:13:53.080 --> 1:13:57.680]  giant victory for everyone what I'm going to do is I'm going to continue with
[1:13:57.680 --> 1:14:02.320]  your calls burn in Canada Ron in Texas John in Texas John Wisconsin Bob in
[1:14:02.320 --> 1:14:07.760]  Ohio and others at the bottom of the hour I'm going to do an overview of
[1:14:07.760 --> 1:14:12.520]  climate gate the Copenhagen global government establishment meeting that
[1:14:12.520 --> 1:14:16.680]  is happening and a lot more and really boil down the master plan of these
[1:14:16.680 --> 1:14:21.240]  people the official UN delegation headed up by the communist Chinese has called
[1:14:21.240 --> 1:14:25.360]  for a planetary dictatorship this is out of the China daily the official
[1:14:25.360 --> 1:14:30.360]  government newspaper they have called for an official planetary dictatorship to
[1:14:30.360 --> 1:14:34.600]  carry out one-child policies in every country of the planet and that's only
[1:14:34.600 --> 1:14:39.800]  part of this plan will be breaking it down coming up in 15 minutes right now
[1:14:39.800 --> 1:14:44.920]  let's go to burn in Canada burn you're on the air hey Alex how's it going man
[1:14:44.920 --> 1:14:49.280]  it's the best of times and the worst of times well it's getting better big guy
[1:14:49.280 --> 1:14:56.160]  hey what we need man we need a global citizens arrest list so the people can
[1:14:56.160 --> 1:15:02.800]  get them when it comes time we need to know who they are you know we got a
[1:15:02.800 --> 1:15:08.400]  rudiment one day and if they take the internet away we're screwed so we need
[1:15:08.400 --> 1:15:14.280]  to know who they are simplify things for the people we need to we need to have
[1:15:14.280 --> 1:15:19.840]  you know Bush and Obama get in trouble for secret CIA hit teams killing people
[1:15:19.840 --> 1:15:24.840]  outside the legislative process and outside of the judicial process I don't
[1:15:24.840 --> 1:15:31.360]  think we should start making a list but we should publicly state that the
[1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:35.040]  billions of deaths conservatively a billion that will happen in the decade
[1:15:35.040 --> 1:15:41.320]  after the climate tax is put in 15 plus million starved to death a year just the
[1:15:41.320 --> 1:15:45.840]  UN ethanol scan scan killed an additional 10 million last year this is
[1:15:45.840 --> 1:15:51.360]  genocide as Lord Moncton said yesterday here on the radio show and so we do need
[1:15:51.360 --> 1:15:55.920]  to point out that these are eugenicist terrorists and people don't know what
[1:15:55.920 --> 1:15:59.640]  eugenicist are when we're breaking that down later but I appreciate your call
[1:15:59.640 --> 1:16:05.120]  burn I I mean obviously everyone knows who the globalist are David Rockefeller
[1:16:05.120 --> 1:16:09.840]  Henry Kissinger the Queen of England the people pushing for world
[1:16:09.840 --> 1:16:13.360]  government Prince Philip calling for exterminating 80% of the world's
[1:16:13.360 --> 1:16:17.520]  population Dr. Eric Pionka at the University of Texas calling for airborne
[1:16:17.520 --> 1:16:21.760]  Ebola to be released to kill 90% of the world's population and how great it's
[1:16:21.760 --> 1:16:26.520]  gonna be we know who these individuals are White House science are calling for
[1:16:26.520 --> 1:16:31.200]  drugging the water supply to sterilize the population we know who these people
[1:16:31.200 --> 1:16:34.960]  are we need to do identify them as criminals and then as they implement
[1:16:34.960 --> 1:16:37.600]  their carbon tax if we can't stop it they're already implementing it the
[1:16:37.600 --> 1:16:41.800]  third world and many first world nations as that bankrupts people as that
[1:16:41.800 --> 1:16:46.480]  causes people to starve as that causes poverty we need to have grand juries
[1:16:46.480 --> 1:16:50.800]  indict them for murder and conspiracy to commit murder because they say they
[1:16:50.800 --> 1:16:53.960]  want to reduce world population and that's why they're quote destroying our
[1:16:53.960 --> 1:16:59.360]  industrial society so we need to continue the education process Ron in
[1:16:59.360 --> 1:17:03.560]  Texas Ron you're on the air thank you sir I just want to say it's a great
[1:17:03.560 --> 1:17:07.200]  honor to share carbon monoxide and a share with you and a fellow brother
[1:17:07.200 --> 1:17:10.920]  fill the same carbon dioxide carbon dioxide's the good guess yeah that they
[1:17:10.920 --> 1:17:16.520]  will tax I just want to say that it's a sad thing and owner go back to
[1:17:16.520 --> 1:17:21.800]  something that Ted Nugent said that about the apathy and okay I quote
[1:17:21.800 --> 1:17:25.120]  somebody said something once that history is a cycle and we're doing to
[1:17:25.120 --> 1:17:29.720]  repeat it if we don't learn from it and a library a little bit more if you don't
[1:17:29.720 --> 1:17:34.400]  experience it yourself as a people you're even more doing that the Native
[1:17:34.400 --> 1:17:38.680]  American a lot of the things that happen to us are happening again on a
[1:17:38.680 --> 1:17:43.200]  broader scale but because it's not actually the official UN model Hitler
[1:17:43.200 --> 1:17:47.080]  built it off what happened to Native Americans here shut off your resources
[1:17:47.080 --> 1:17:51.640]  put you on reservations and then slowly exterminate you yeah exactly and
[1:17:51.640 --> 1:17:55.760]  because most of the people have never experienced it it's not going on to them
[1:17:55.760 --> 1:18:00.480]  they don't see it and you don't have to look at the third world because they
[1:18:00.480 --> 1:18:05.280]  don't say it's not good they say it's not going on my yard so I don't care look
[1:18:05.280 --> 1:18:09.000]  back at the history of what's going on here you have people living in third
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:12.840]  world conditions now that are starving you have people that are suffering from
[1:18:12.840 --> 1:18:17.840]  disease now that are that are dying all because of new order which started for
[1:18:17.840 --> 1:18:24.320]  my people in 1492 and if they wake up read people like Angie de Beau and see
[1:18:24.320 --> 1:18:30.440]  what's going on maybe we'll start getting more people woke up but until then
[1:18:30.440 --> 1:18:34.960]  you can see I'm real strong about this I've been awake for since I was seven
[1:18:34.960 --> 1:18:39.120]  years old fighting this and it's just an honor to talk with you about it and I
[1:18:39.120 --> 1:18:42.720]  don't take up any more your time but thank you God bless you sir good to hear
[1:18:42.720 --> 1:18:50.000]  from you let's talk to John in Texas John go ahead Alex hey growing up in the
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:55.840]  fifties nobody I knew of including our family had health insurance but when you
[1:18:55.840 --> 1:18:58.640]  went to the doctor you went to the hospital you didn't get bankrupted
[1:18:58.640 --> 1:19:04.160]  either it was easy to you know the government bureaucracy and welfare is
[1:19:04.160 --> 1:19:08.320]  what screwed up our system and now the government's answer is ten times more
[1:19:08.320 --> 1:19:13.600]  government and notice Obama's health care plan strips 41 billion out of Medicare
[1:19:13.600 --> 1:19:19.080]  over 30 billion out of Medicaid a year so they're taking your health care you the
[1:19:19.080 --> 1:19:23.720]  fools out there that like big government because the doctors had fair
[1:19:23.720 --> 1:19:28.320]  rates back then it was easy to pay off and nobody lacked for health care all
[1:19:28.320 --> 1:19:32.160]  of a sudden now that if you go to the hospital you're bankrupted and so you
[1:19:32.160 --> 1:19:35.960]  got to have this socialized medicine it's just you know disgusting that's the
[1:19:35.960 --> 1:19:41.000]  plan make you dependent on government so they can forcibly sterilize you that's
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:45.920]  in the official government announcements people have trouble dealing with this
[1:19:45.920 --> 1:19:50.440]  because it's so horrifying but it's real the facts are in more phone calls
[1:19:50.440 --> 1:19:55.320]  straight ahead thanks John for the call we'll take another call from John in
[1:19:55.320 --> 1:19:59.960]  Wisconsin and Bob Tom and others and then I'm gonna break down the latest
[1:19:59.960 --> 1:20:04.200]  developments from Copenhagen studies have shown that many people do not get the
[1:20:04.200 --> 1:20:07.920]  proper vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain good health with so many

[1:25:03.560 --> 1:25:08.880]  John in Wisconsin John you're on the air go ahead well I wanted to thank you for
[1:25:08.880 --> 1:25:12.680]  taking my call and thanks for your good work thanks for calling what's on your
[1:25:12.680 --> 1:25:18.400]  mind well first off if you ever need any work with FOIA stuff I'm real good at
[1:25:18.400 --> 1:25:22.600]  that as your governor Perry found out with his emails and but the main thing I
[1:25:22.600 --> 1:25:27.080]  wanted to alert you to is that the apple to Wisconsin Planned Parenthood a group
[1:25:27.080 --> 1:25:33.000]  called live action has videotaped them giving just patently absurd and false
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:37.720]  medical information well they also the Planned Parenthood also advertises you
[1:25:37.720 --> 1:25:41.720]  can give money just to kill black babies and in 2008 we haven't gotten the
[1:25:41.720 --> 1:25:47.440]  numbers for 2009 there were more black babies aborted than were born and this
[1:25:47.440 --> 1:25:52.280]  this videotape makes up very clear that their main money makers abortions I mean
[1:25:52.280 --> 1:25:55.520]  this guy's giving this woman a hard sell that makes a used card salesman look
[1:25:55.520 --> 1:26:00.560]  like a piker and so it's a it's a group called live action they have a really
[1:26:00.560 --> 1:26:03.920]  nice video out there so I thought you might want to add that to your you know
[1:26:03.920 --> 1:26:08.280]  Planned Parenthood is a genocidal eugenics operation well I mean they're
[1:26:08.280 --> 1:26:12.440]  admittedly founded by the Rockefellers and Margaret Sanger for that reason I
[1:26:12.440 --> 1:26:17.560]  mean Hitler thanked Margaret Sanger but again the the real Nazis pose as
[1:26:17.560 --> 1:26:23.280]  liberals that's the big issue here good points anything else John I don't like
[1:26:23.280 --> 1:26:27.080]  said in that in every regard you're kind of preaching to the choir yeah but we

[1:39:51.920 --> 1:39:56.040]  just in layman's terms give you a basic overview that I want to go through
[1:39:56.040 --> 1:40:06.200]  mainstream news in your face backing all of this up about 150 years ago in
[1:40:06.200 --> 1:40:15.800]  England the royal family publicly funded Galton Darwin the Huxleys the Wedge
[1:40:15.800 --> 1:40:20.280]  Woods and others the top scientific inventors the top scientific brains in
[1:40:20.280 --> 1:40:30.000]  England pioneering eugenics anthropology sociology the list goes on and on they
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:33.880]  went to them and they said people are rebelling against the Empire worldwide
[1:40:33.880 --> 1:40:39.480]  how do we set up a scientific dictatorship where the people love their
[1:40:39.480 --> 1:40:44.840]  own servitude we have all these white papers we cover them an endgame this is
[1:40:44.840 --> 1:40:52.080]  mainline history this is on the record and they came back and they said we have
[1:40:52.080 --> 1:40:59.200]  to create social departments planned parenthood we have to create health
[1:40:59.200 --> 1:41:07.080]  departments that will carry out racial hygiene and we will start taking poor
[1:41:07.080 --> 1:41:11.680]  people's children we will start sterilizing them we can start drugging
[1:41:11.680 --> 1:41:17.920]  the water supply to make people passive and to go along with our orders we can't
[1:41:17.920 --> 1:41:21.680]  put in puppet governments in the third world that we control take down the
[1:41:21.680 --> 1:41:29.040]  British flag but have covert operations that work through puppet governments and
[1:41:29.040 --> 1:41:34.800]  through roundtable groups so they set up the royal commissions who then set up
[1:41:34.800 --> 1:41:38.400]  the Royal Institute on International Affairs who set up the Council on
[1:41:38.400 --> 1:41:43.160]  Foreign Relations in the United States and other management groups that
[1:41:43.160 --> 1:41:49.440]  actually control the industry banking media academia and most of the people in
[1:41:49.440 --> 1:41:57.720]  those groups aren't aware of the full scope of the operational system so you
[1:41:57.720 --> 1:42:03.280]  have higher level groups that control that and they called for through banking
[1:42:03.280 --> 1:42:08.800]  and through fiat currency going in and buying off Third World and First World
[1:42:08.800 --> 1:42:13.200]  Nations leaders and to get those countries in debt as long as they pay it
[1:42:13.200 --> 1:42:16.720]  off the leadership if the countries wouldn't go along with it they would
[1:42:16.720 --> 1:42:22.160]  finance revolutions within or finance their neighbors to attack them this is
[1:42:22.160 --> 1:42:27.520]  all declassified the Milner papers from Lord Milner in 1914 the list goes on
[1:42:27.520 --> 1:42:32.640]  and on they said we will institute World War one and World War two this is over
[1:42:32.640 --> 1:42:37.280]  a hundred years ago as a pretext to make the public say we don't want any more
[1:42:37.280 --> 1:42:41.840]  war we want a global private corporate government through the League of Nations
[1:42:41.840 --> 1:42:47.280]  in the United Nations to end all war but in truth they actually hand out the
[1:42:47.280 --> 1:42:51.520]  weapons systems and the technological systems so that actually more wars get
[1:42:51.520 --> 1:42:57.520]  started and that of course has come out in the public record by the 60s they
[1:42:57.520 --> 1:43:02.720]  came up with the environmental plan to carry out eugenics and to tell the
[1:43:02.720 --> 1:43:07.480]  public the world was overpopulated and that resources had to be cut off to the
[1:43:07.480 --> 1:43:12.040]  planet to save the planet and Maury strong at the UN David Rockefeller and
[1:43:12.040 --> 1:43:15.840]  others wrote books and gave statements and gave speeches at the UN and the UN
[1:43:15.840 --> 1:43:23.960]  wrote up battle plans to forcibly reduce world population by cutting off the
[1:43:23.960 --> 1:43:27.960]  resources and going in and paying off the government's leaders to engage in
[1:43:27.960 --> 1:43:32.920]  forced sterilization 500,000 plus women were sterilized 34 states passed laws
[1:43:32.920 --> 1:43:37.800]  for forced sterilization that really happened environmentally by the turn of
[1:43:37.800 --> 1:43:41.920]  the last century but it but they relaunched at the 60s Hitler embarrassed
[1:43:41.920 --> 1:43:46.600]  them by having a brand of eugenics that was a little fast moving for them and
[1:43:46.600 --> 1:43:49.840]  also only targeted certain groups so they then began to call themselves
[1:43:49.840 --> 1:43:55.320]  environmentalist transhumanist the eugenics quarterly changed its name to
[1:43:55.320 --> 1:44:01.120]  an environmental study group they became crypto eugenicists and they have
[1:44:01.120 --> 1:44:04.720]  stated that they would fear monger the planet in the name of an ice age the
[1:44:04.720 --> 1:44:11.560]  name of global heating global warming acid rain to accept this and that once
[1:44:11.560 --> 1:44:15.480]  the private central banks had gotten the nations in enough debt they would
[1:44:15.480 --> 1:44:19.360]  bankrupt them by design use global deals with China who was their partner in
[1:44:19.360 --> 1:44:24.360]  1975 via treaty that George Bush senior got them to sign when he was
[1:44:24.360 --> 1:44:30.280]  ambassador to China to have a one-child policy where the babies are taken or in
[1:44:30.280 --> 1:44:35.040]  many cases killed that's on record forced abortions are performed and China
[1:44:35.040 --> 1:44:40.640]  was told all major industrial facilities will be moved to China we will set up
[1:44:40.640 --> 1:44:46.080]  cartels and monopolies where all other industry is bankrupted a select group of
[1:44:46.080 --> 1:44:50.200]  banks financing this will own the sub-corporations and the Chinese
[1:44:50.200 --> 1:44:56.440]  government will then be set up as the new world superpower by 2010 we're now
[1:44:56.440 --> 1:45:00.960]  2010 in just a few weeks and they've announced they are the new superpower
[1:45:00.960 --> 1:45:06.320]  they are the controlling arm China would then own the majority of British
[1:45:06.320 --> 1:45:11.360]  European and u.s. debt and would be able to order things through the UN that's
[1:45:11.360 --> 1:45:17.680]  now been announced yesterday the economy would be completely bankrupted in
[1:45:17.680 --> 1:45:23.480]  phases if you are too poor CPS will visit your home and will take your
[1:45:23.480 --> 1:45:28.320]  children school will be year-round that's all in government textbooks like
[1:45:28.320 --> 1:45:32.600]  eco science written by Paul Ehrlich chief advisor to George Bush senior and to
[1:45:32.600 --> 1:45:39.620]  Barack Obama John P. Holdren current White House science are they will then
[1:45:39.620 --> 1:45:44.840]  set up a global carbon tax that with a ID card issued nationally but globally
[1:45:44.840 --> 1:45:49.400]  standardized under a treaty signed with the UN in 2000 or everything you eat
[1:45:49.400 --> 1:45:53.000]  everywhere you go everything you do will be tracked license plate reading
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:45:56.560]  cameras already going on in England Europe and the US will tax you by the
[1:45:56.560 --> 1:46:00.600]  mile track everywhere you go when your carbon credits run out you're already
[1:46:00.600 --> 1:46:05.760]  taxed the taxes will go way up to as much as $10 per mile driven there will
[1:46:05.760 --> 1:46:10.080]  be taxes on all beef all chicken all fish that will be added by a global
[1:46:10.080 --> 1:46:15.000]  regulatory body run by the IMF and World Bank that is now in the Danish text of
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:20.920]  the Copenhagen global government treaty Herman von Rompuy the new head of the
[1:46:20.920 --> 1:46:27.440]  EU openly states this Al Gore openly states this it's all happening everything
[1:46:27.440 --> 1:46:31.280]  will systematically and incrementally so you can't stand up against it as easily
[1:46:31.280 --> 1:46:36.000]  if it happens overnight you'd stand up be implemented year-round school you'll
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:40.720]  have to stay at school till 8 9 at night everyone will get monthly CPS health
[1:46:40.720 --> 1:46:48.920]  department eugenics visits to your home this is so unbelievably horrible ladies
[1:46:48.920 --> 1:46:54.920]  and gentlemen that I shake when I talk about I literally woke up at 4 a.m.
[1:46:54.920 --> 1:46:58.480]  again this morning completely freaked out over this because it's all been
[1:46:58.480 --> 1:47:01.880]  announced it's one thing to read State Department memorandum 200 where Henry
[1:47:01.880 --> 1:47:05.240]  Kissinger stated this in 73 it's one thing to read the United Nations
[1:47:05.240 --> 1:47:09.200]  biological diversity assessment 96 calling for exterminating 80% of the
[1:47:09.200 --> 1:47:12.920]  population it's one thing to know all this was coming it's another thing to
[1:47:12.920 --> 1:47:17.200]  now see it happening I want to play Herman von Rompuy the new head of the
[1:47:17.200 --> 1:47:22.520]  EU saying global governance the first year of global governance is 2009 here
[1:47:22.520 --> 1:47:28.840]  it is 2009 is also the first year of global governance with the establishment
[1:47:28.840 --> 1:47:33.760]  of the G20 in the middle of the financial crisis the climate conference in
[1:47:33.760 --> 1:47:40.480]  Copenhagen is another step towards the global management of our planet okay
[1:47:40.480 --> 1:47:44.520]  the global management of our planet for global government global governance here
[1:47:44.520 --> 1:47:55.920]  is Al Gore saying the same thing calling there is the awareness itself that
[1:47:55.920 --> 1:48:00.560]  will drive the change and one of the ways it will drive the change is through
[1:48:00.560 --> 1:48:06.240]  global governance and global agreements but the many business leaders who have
[1:48:06.240 --> 1:48:12.760]  been present here that's right and that's the next key the fortune 100 Dutch
[1:48:12.760 --> 1:48:17.720]  Royal Shell Exxon mobile to now come out in the climate and emails are running at
[1:48:17.720 --> 1:48:21.600]  all while saying oh you're with the oil companies the oil companies are owned by
[1:48:21.600 --> 1:48:25.760]  the big banks and insurance companies they own this now in fall the Republic
[1:48:25.760 --> 1:48:32.840]  that's been out for almost two months before climate gave we have their
[1:48:32.840 --> 1:48:37.760]  statements in their documents where the IMF and World Bank will run the
[1:48:37.760 --> 1:48:42.640]  planetary government and you will pay your carbon taxes to them the treaty was
[1:48:42.640 --> 1:48:46.520]  meant to be secret the new global government treaty was meant to be secret
[1:48:46.520 --> 1:48:50.200]  until next week during the two-week Copenhagen global government conference
[1:48:50.200 --> 1:48:54.960]  but it was leaked three days ago to the London Guardian the UN confirms it is the
[1:48:54.960 --> 1:48:59.360]  treaty it says the UN is only a front the IMF and World Bank will now set up
[1:48:59.360 --> 1:49:04.160]  planetary government through the G20 there will be a global authority over
[1:49:04.160 --> 1:49:11.360]  all travel 2% flat tax over every nation paid to the IMF and World Bank 30% tax
[1:49:11.360 --> 1:49:16.680]  on all fossil fuels natural gas taxes on all meat television sets light bulbs
[1:49:16.680 --> 1:49:23.840]  water there are over 150 taxes 700 new bureaucracies Obama has said this was in
[1:49:23.840 --> 1:49:28.800]  AP two days ago headline Obama threatens command and control and he says
[1:49:28.800 --> 1:49:33.680]  even if Congress the Senate won't ratify this he's going to sign it he can't sign
[1:49:33.680 --> 1:49:38.920]  it and do it if they won't ratify it but he says I am a dictator I'm going to do
[1:49:38.920 --> 1:49:44.920]  this and he's illegally getting $500,000 cash payment from the Nobel
[1:49:44.920 --> 1:49:51.240]  Laureate Committee and being given this warmongering peace price so we're going
[1:49:51.240 --> 1:49:54.840]  into global government and our Senate's being told we don't care if you're not
[1:49:54.840 --> 1:49:58.600]  gonna ratify the treaty we're gonna do it through the bureaucracy unless carbon
[1:49:58.600 --> 1:50:03.280]  dioxide is a toxic waste that humans exhale and plants live off of the plants
[1:50:03.280 --> 1:50:09.880]  respirate that they breathe up through photo of synthesis this is all human
[1:50:09.880 --> 1:50:14.480]  activity Copenhagen climate summit on top of that they sold the third world
[1:50:14.480 --> 1:50:18.360]  that you're gonna get to loot America you're gonna get all these taxes from
[1:50:18.360 --> 1:50:21.400]  the same IMF and World Bank that have always been raping the third world
[1:50:21.400 --> 1:50:26.120]  through 30% loan sharking rates were a $1,000,000 loan in Nigeria turns into 45
[1:50:26.120 --> 1:50:32.600]  55 65 billion now it states in here double the energy cuts for Africa Latin
[1:50:32.600 --> 1:50:37.480]  America and undeveloped Asia or developing Asia 15 million starved to

[1:54:06.320 --> 1:54:11.480]  no longer any denial a private corporate government made up of the same
[1:54:11.480 --> 1:54:14.920]  banks that have imploded the world's economy by design
[1:54:14.920 --> 1:54:18.680]  mclatchy newspapers has written a five-part series on the Goldman Sachs
[1:54:18.680 --> 1:54:22.280]  documents coming out how this was all rigged the banks have been given
[1:54:22.280 --> 1:54:27.040]  unlimited power to steal money that's now in the times of London today that the
[1:54:27.040 --> 1:54:34.600]  UN's adding on a new tax with this plan for global banking bailouts the UN will
[1:54:34.600 --> 1:54:38.880]  no longer have in any power over this it will be the IMF and World Bank that are
[1:54:38.880 --> 1:54:44.280]  the new global government who can quote this is London Guardian secretly raise
[1:54:44.280 --> 1:54:49.560]  any taxes they want and under treaty our government signs on illegally to do
[1:54:49.560 --> 1:54:53.760]  whatever they say and then our Senate says we're not going to do it and Obama
[1:54:53.760 --> 1:54:59.160]  says I'll implement it anyways then hot reason totally illegal absolutely
[1:54:59.160 --> 1:55:04.760]  impeachable offense as Ron Paul said with us in the first hour today now here
[1:55:04.760 --> 1:55:10.920]  is China Daily the big government newspaper in China population control
[1:55:10.920 --> 1:55:15.360]  called key to deal population at climate change and intertwined but the
[1:55:15.360 --> 1:55:19.560]  population issue has remained a blind spot yes climate change we have normal
[1:55:19.560 --> 1:55:22.320]  climate change but now they say it's abnormal first it was global warming
[1:55:22.320 --> 1:55:26.000]  first global freezing then global warming now just any changes not normal
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:29.680]  discuss ways to mitigate climate change dealing with climate change is not
[1:55:29.680 --> 1:55:33.560]  simply an issue of co2 emissions reduction but a comprehensive challenge to
[1:55:33.560 --> 1:55:37.480]  involving political economic social cultural and economic issues and the
[1:55:37.480 --> 1:55:41.200]  population concern fits right into the picture said Zhao who's a member of the
[1:55:41.200 --> 1:55:46.160]  Chinese government delegation and it goes on to call for a planetary regime to
[1:55:46.160 --> 1:55:50.600]  reduce humans and China then went on to say we want a global one-child policy
[1:55:50.600 --> 1:55:56.240]  now what was in the national post one of the biggest papers in Canada yesterday
[1:55:56.240 --> 1:56:01.160]  we have the communist Chinese that own most our debt saying we'll sign on to
[1:56:01.160 --> 1:56:05.600]  this if you set up a world one-child policy and they're talking about getting
[1:56:05.600 --> 1:56:09.160]  rid of the tax credits in the US for having children and then putting a tax
[1:56:09.160 --> 1:56:14.520]  on you that's how the Chinese one child policy started in 75 by 1980 it was law
[1:56:14.520 --> 1:56:19.280]  they have forced abortions forced infanticide they take the children kill
[1:56:19.280 --> 1:56:24.520]  them use them for medical experiments that's mainstream news the real and
[1:56:24.520 --> 1:56:31.140]  convenient truth the whole world needs to adopt China's one-child policy the
[1:56:31.140 --> 1:56:35.480]  inconvenient truth overhanging the UN's Copenhagen conference is not that
[1:56:35.480 --> 1:56:38.640]  climate is warming or cooling but that humans are overpopulating the world a
[1:56:38.640 --> 1:56:42.960]  planetary law such as China's one-child policy is the only way to reverse the
[1:56:42.960 --> 1:56:47.760]  disastrous global birth rate and they go on to say that we have to get rid of
[1:56:47.760 --> 1:56:52.040]  humans now what does eco science written by the White House science are say
[1:56:52.040 --> 1:56:57.480]  same thing what does Dr. Eric Bianca UT say a global police state government
[1:56:57.480 --> 1:57:02.040]  that's a quote to carry out the orderly extermination of 90% of the world's
[1:57:02.040 --> 1:57:08.560]  population they debate 80 90 95 Ted Turner says 95 Prince Philip says 80%
[1:57:08.560 --> 1:57:15.120]  this is what the big banks want they want to get rid of people and they talk
[1:57:15.120 --> 1:57:17.960]  about how they're drugging the water supply and want to drug the water
[1:57:17.960 --> 1:57:22.920]  supply to sterilize you and the sperm counts down over 85% in every nation
[1:57:22.920 --> 1:57:29.640]  that adds chemicals to the water not just fluoride I indict the globalist I
[1:57:29.640 --> 1:57:33.840]  indict the UN these are not environmentalist well-meaning wackos
[1:57:33.840 --> 1:57:37.640]  that are just wrong these are lying people that want to hijack the whole
[1:57:37.640 --> 1:57:42.080]  economy have global taxes to the criminal private banks run by people like
[1:57:42.080 --> 1:57:46.120]  Ken lay and made off same crew they were both Ken Lake him up with a carbon
[1:57:46.120 --> 1:57:52.560]  tax plan with Al Gore I indict you for genocide just your ethanol plan killed
[1:57:52.560 --> 1:57:56.520]  an additional 10 million people on top of the normal 15 million from starvation
[1:57:56.520 --> 1:58:02.800]  under the Copenhagen global treaty double or right at double right at double
[1:58:02.800 --> 1:58:06.080]  it's a little under double the cuts have to be made by the developing and third
[1:58:06.080 --> 1:58:11.880]  world that the West has to make the taxes this will kill a billion people if
[1:58:11.880 --> 1:58:15.960]  implemented in the first decade those are conservative numbers the magnitude
[1:58:15.960 --> 1:58:21.440]  of this this is eugenics this is starvation this is mass murder this is
[1:58:21.440 --> 1:58:26.600]  death this is real this has always been their plan I have thousands of their
[1:58:26.600 --> 1:58:30.320]  documents hundreds of their textbooks all the UN documents the State
[1:58:30.320 --> 1:58:35.320]  Department documents the Club of Rome documents a total Chinese-style police
[1:58:35.320 --> 1:58:43.000]  state murdering your children forced abortions it's real you better wake up
[1:58:43.000 --> 1:58:53.720]  thank you for listening to GCN be sure to visit GCN live calm today hundreds of
[1:58:53.720 --> 1:58:57.920]  nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last
[1:58:57.920 --> 1:59:02.920]  chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that will be
[1:59:02.920 --> 1:59:07.840]  pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home tremendous influence on our
[1:59:07.840 --> 1:59:12.080]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[1:59:12.080 --> 1:59:17.320]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[1:59:17.320 --> 1:59:21.920]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[1:59:21.920 --> 1:59:26.280]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[1:59:26.280 --> 1:59:30.040]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[1:59:30.040 --> 1:59:33.960]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[1:59:33.960 --> 1:59:39.520]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[1:59:39.520 --> 1:59:45.640]  the Republic get your copy a full of the Republic on DVD at info wars.com we're

[2:00:37.120 --> 2:00:41.760]  World Order master plan what their plan was what they currently set up the open
[2:00:41.760 --> 2:00:46.080]  takeover there's a headline in the Times of London the end of freedom on the
[2:00:46.080 --> 2:00:52.000]  ocean you in control over the ocean treaty an international small arms ban
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:55.920]  that Obama says he's going to sign superseding the Second Amendment that's
[2:00:55.920 --> 2:01:01.600]  happening Congress says they won't pass the UN treaty they won't ratify it so
[2:01:01.600 --> 2:01:07.560]  Obama says he's just going to implement it by fiat high treason and the stated
[2:01:07.560 --> 2:01:12.600]  goal of the carbon taxes by the UN and the taxes on all human activity and
[2:01:12.600 --> 2:01:17.240]  listing carbon dioxide that humans exhale as a toxic waste is to starve
[2:01:17.240 --> 2:01:22.560]  people to death in the third world shut off industry and business so bad in the
[2:01:22.560 --> 2:01:26.680]  United States in Europe and Japan that everyone or almost everyone becomes
[2:01:26.680 --> 2:01:30.280]  bankrupt government run health care to control your life to then carry out
[2:01:30.280 --> 2:01:35.240]  eugenics euthanasia forced abortion the case for killing granting the cover of
[2:01:35.240 --> 2:01:40.080]  Newsweek telling you how great suicide is in other articles teaching children
[2:01:40.080 --> 2:01:43.680]  they're bad and that suicide is good that's ABC news people won't believe me
[2:01:43.680 --> 2:01:48.840]  pull up ABC news teaching children when to die want to see that headline along
[2:01:48.840 --> 2:01:51.840]  with the cartoons they show them of animals being killed and say see you
[2:01:51.840 --> 2:01:57.320]  need to kill yourself this is so diabolical so cult like so evil training
[2:01:57.320 --> 2:02:01.120]  humans to turn off their survival instinct to turn their survival instinct
[2:02:01.120 --> 2:02:06.520]  into something of species survival which is false to kill ourselves we have to
[2:02:06.520 --> 2:02:12.280]  indict the people publicly for the sickening Malthusian hitlerian scum
[2:02:12.280 --> 2:02:18.560]  they are openly telling us planetary government to carry out one child
[2:02:18.560 --> 2:02:23.080]  policies once you're bankrupted in the west they will then come to an
[2:02:23.080 --> 2:02:27.360]  assessment and take your children from you this is what they've stated they're
[2:02:27.360 --> 2:02:32.000]  now announcing it 22,000 homes in England now children at birth the parents
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:35.960]  have to put cameras in their homes guilty until proven innocent for six months
[2:02:35.960 --> 2:02:40.640]  to prove they're not abusive the child falls down once you don't feed them
[2:02:40.640 --> 2:02:47.800]  right they take your children cameras in homes 1984 they are drugging the water
[2:02:47.800 --> 2:02:52.120]  supply that's come out and been declassified it's not just sewer runoff
[2:02:52.120 --> 2:02:55.800]  in cities like Dallas and others they've done studies where the prozac is
[2:02:55.800 --> 2:02:59.320]  hundreds of times higher than it could be from runoff it's being added
[2:02:59.320 --> 2:03:03.920]  meanwhile the British US and Japanese governments you can pull up MSNBC this
[2:03:03.920 --> 2:03:11.000]  year proposed putting statin and time cholesterol drugs in the water when they
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  cause all those liver problems forced medication and prozac type drugs in the
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:19.840]  water well they're already doing it as they call for an eco science to make
[2:03:19.840 --> 2:03:25.280]  you docile out of thousands of plastic combinations 50 years ago globally a
[2:03:25.280 --> 2:03:30.160]  type of plastic was adopted that leeches powerful estrogen mimicers that
[2:03:30.160 --> 2:03:35.840]  sterilize men and make women hyperharmonal and give them breast cancer by
[2:03:35.840 --> 2:03:40.120]  design the UN's been caught adding female hormones to tetanus shots that then
[2:03:40.120 --> 2:03:44.920]  sterilize women that's mainstream news this year AP reported the UN got caught
[2:03:44.920 --> 2:03:50.600]  in Africa Latin America Middle East Central Asia and Southeast Asia giving
[2:03:50.600 --> 2:03:59.240]  people live weaponized polio killing them in mass associated press Chicago
[2:03:59.240 --> 2:04:04.040]  tribunes Chicago water in public reports city silent over sex hormones and
[2:04:04.040 --> 2:04:09.800]  painkillers found in treated drinking water it's being added in streams and
[2:04:09.800 --> 2:04:14.200]  rivers that have no human runoff into them the plants the animals are becoming
[2:04:14.200 --> 2:04:18.840]  sterilized the frogs the fish the salamanders it's being added they've
[2:04:18.840 --> 2:04:24.480]  caught water supplies going to humans that have no runoff from sewage so
[2:04:24.480 --> 2:04:28.360]  could not have these drugs they found it hundreds of times the level it should
[2:04:28.360 --> 2:04:33.880]  be you are being drugged that's why you feel like garbage that's why you can't
[2:04:33.880 --> 2:04:37.560]  get your energy up that's why you can't get angry at the New World Order that's
[2:04:37.560 --> 2:04:42.280]  why you've lost your vision you're living inside the New World Order when we
[2:04:42.280 --> 2:04:44.840]  come back with Bob Chapman I'm going to tell you what they're going to do if
[2:04:44.840 --> 2:04:49.120]  they win and how they're going to carry out the extermination in a very brief
[2:04:49.120 --> 2:04:53.400]  synopsis we have all the evidence from their own statements how they're doing
[2:04:53.400 --> 2:04:57.040]  it how have I known all this was going to come how did I know they'd announce
[2:04:57.040 --> 2:05:00.600]  global government at this Copenhagen summit because they said they would 20
[2:05:00.600 --> 2:05:05.800]  years ago hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions if you're
[2:05:05.800 --> 2:05:09.720]  going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm how much ammunition

[2:08:10.560 --> 2:08:17.160]  we are back live I'm going to Bob Chapman of the international forecaster to
[2:08:17.160 --> 2:08:21.440]  get his take on the global government eugenics program there is no longer any
[2:08:21.440 --> 2:08:25.120]  doubt the public in the past wouldn't go read you in documents state department
[2:08:25.120 --> 2:08:30.360]  documents club of Rome council and foreign relations stating they would set up
[2:08:30.360 --> 2:08:34.400]  a planetary regime run by private banks they would tax everything as a form of
[2:08:34.400 --> 2:08:38.720]  neo feudalistic serfdom shut off your energy your power take your children
[2:08:38.720 --> 2:08:43.720]  from you drug your water supply dumb you down put cancer viruses and vaccines to
[2:08:43.720 --> 2:08:48.440]  kill you soft kill weapons that take decades to activate implanting your
[2:08:48.440 --> 2:08:55.200]  DNA with the viral RNA this is all been done by design I know it's monstrous I
[2:08:55.200 --> 2:08:59.600]  know it's hard to believe but if we don't stop them and if we don't publicly
[2:08:59.600 --> 2:09:03.560]  stand up and say you are a group of murdering killers calling for global
[2:09:03.560 --> 2:09:08.000]  Chinese one-child policy forced abortions police state if we don't get
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:11.240]  aggressive with these people they're going to come in and push their agenda
[2:09:11.240 --> 2:09:16.440]  now the national post one of the biggest papers in Canada that wrote the
[2:09:16.440 --> 2:09:20.640]  headline the real inconvenient truth the whole world needs to adopt China's
[2:09:20.640 --> 2:09:25.640]  one-child policy a global government planetary law such as China's one-child
[2:09:25.640 --> 2:09:29.840]  policy is the only way to save the planet that's what this is really about
[2:09:29.840 --> 2:09:34.480]  when real world population is going to plane off the UN admits at eight and a
[2:09:34.480 --> 2:09:39.280]  half billion or less the West is having a replacement rate of 1.3 children for
[2:09:39.280 --> 2:09:44.680]  every two adults they're only having 1.3 children it's all a fraud if they would
[2:09:44.680 --> 2:09:49.360]  just have industrialized the third world which the Kyoto and Copenhagen
[2:09:49.360 --> 2:09:52.560]  agreements are meant to stop they admit it's meant to freeze their industrial
[2:09:52.560 --> 2:09:56.280]  capacity they have to make double the cuts we do based on the fraud that
[2:09:56.280 --> 2:10:01.000]  carbon dioxide's deadly poison if we would have allowed them to industrialize
[2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:04.080]  their numbers would have dropped even if you believe the world's overpopulated
[2:10:04.080 --> 2:10:07.960]  that's what's so cold-blooded about this they keep the people bomb going to
[2:10:07.960 --> 2:10:11.760]  just to hurt these countries because they never get industrialized they keep
[2:10:11.760 --> 2:10:15.360]  them from industrializing and then say oh now we just got to sterilize them so
[2:10:15.360 --> 2:10:19.680]  keep them from industrializing and then sterilize them the West is only having
[2:10:19.680 --> 2:10:24.920]  1.3 children from Japan to the United States 1.3 children for every two
[2:10:24.920 --> 2:10:29.400]  indigenous adults that live there the US has grown in population because of
[2:10:29.400 --> 2:10:34.360]  massive over three million illegals a million illegals a year coming in that's
[2:10:34.360 --> 2:10:37.840]  what's replacing our dying numbers the death of the West that Pat Buchanan
[2:10:37.840 --> 2:10:42.960]  has written so much about this is the reality and they are going to stage
[2:10:42.960 --> 2:10:46.800]  terror attacks to set up a bigger police state so you can't politically change
[2:10:46.800 --> 2:10:49.960]  what they're doing they are going to release more and more controlled
[2:10:49.960 --> 2:10:56.120]  biological plagues then put soft kill viruses RNA and your vaccines they are
[2:10:56.120 --> 2:11:00.200]  just going to continue taking your children from you bankrupting you through
[2:11:00.200 --> 2:11:05.080]  taxes government run health care to make you dependent on them and they are just
[2:11:05.080 --> 2:11:09.800]  going to phase this in over the next 25 years they have stated until world
[2:11:09.800 --> 2:11:14.560]  population starts imploding and the elites say they're doing this in public
[2:11:14.560 --> 2:11:18.800]  writings so they can have control of the future so they can have control of
[2:11:18.800 --> 2:11:22.960]  resources for themselves and their families and so they can have the life
[2:11:22.960 --> 2:11:26.800]  extension technologies for themselves they do not want to give those life
[2:11:26.800 --> 2:11:31.920]  extension technologies to the general public you can't give people systems
[2:11:31.920 --> 2:11:36.680]  that allow them to live to 150 or older and by then even past that because of
[2:11:36.680 --> 2:11:42.280]  the way technology will grow this is what Ray Kurzweil is saying this is what
[2:11:42.280 --> 2:11:45.760]  all the top futurists at the UN are saying this is what the Pentagon says
[2:11:45.760 --> 2:11:50.200]  this is what Bill Joy co-owner of Sun Microsystems has written about in
[2:11:50.200 --> 2:11:55.160]  Wired magazine intellectuals are all aware of this but the average well
[2:11:55.160 --> 2:11:59.680]  educated intellectual is told oh you're elite you're smart you'll be part of
[2:11:59.680 --> 2:12:04.640]  this get on board with the program they think they're part of it even low level
[2:12:04.640 --> 2:12:08.920]  professors are part of this newspaper writers everywhere calling for one child
[2:12:08.920 --> 2:12:13.320]  policies I'm sure you've seen it on the news to lower the carbon footprint this
[2:12:13.320 --> 2:12:18.360]  is a revolution what they call the final revolution of a scientific
[2:12:18.360 --> 2:12:23.080]  dictatorship where a rebellion of the people will be as unthinkable as a
[2:12:23.080 --> 2:12:28.880]  rebellion of sheep against the practice of eating mutton or baby sheep that's a
[2:12:28.880 --> 2:12:35.120]  quote from Barton Russell as Aldous Huxley said whose brother ran the UN
[2:12:35.120 --> 2:12:39.560]  eugenics program secretary general of UNESCO Julian Huxley Aldous Huxley said
[2:12:39.560 --> 2:12:44.360]  the scientific dictatorship will make you love your servitude love having your
[2:12:44.360 --> 2:12:48.800]  bills going up love having your children taken love dying of cancer from the
[2:12:48.800 --> 2:12:54.000]  inoculations the governments declassify that they put cancer viruses in over 200
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:12:59.840]  million dosages of the polio vaccine that killed millions this is on record
[2:12:59.840 --> 2:13:04.760]  associated press in fact for everybody watching on TV and radio Google
[2:13:04.760 --> 2:13:14.000]  associated press source AP polio vaccine killed polio vaccine live and you'll see
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:18.080]  AP this year like it's no big deal oh all over the world the UN gave people
[2:13:18.080 --> 2:13:22.880]  live weaponized polio in vaccines and it killed them oh it was a mistake no
[2:13:22.880 --> 2:13:27.600]  they've been doing that for 40 years that we know of ladies and gentlemen this
[2:13:27.600 --> 2:13:33.080]  is so diabolical why does a young 15 year old girl get in the car with Ted
[2:13:33.080 --> 2:13:37.400]  Bundy at the mall he's wearing a suit he's handsome he's well-spoken hey honey
[2:13:37.400 --> 2:13:40.320]  let's go have fun let me go buy you hamburger and we can have some fun in
[2:13:40.320 --> 2:13:45.480]  the back she's 15 she's getting all sexually charged up you know the guys
[2:13:45.480 --> 2:13:48.840]  her age aren't hitting on her she wants to have some fun she wants to get back
[2:13:48.840 --> 2:13:53.240]  at her parents she can't believe that in 30 minutes she's gonna be tied up in a
[2:13:53.240 --> 2:13:58.400]  shack with him torturing her and biting chunks out of her you are the same way
[2:13:58.400 --> 2:14:03.440]  America and the rest of the world you have been taught that globalism is cute
[2:14:03.440 --> 2:14:08.560]  print that article for me they found it CBS News is just one of them mutant
[2:14:08.560 --> 2:14:12.840]  polio virus spreads in Nigeria the next line they admit like it's no big deal oh
[2:14:12.840 --> 2:14:18.640]  it was spread to the vaccine you better wake up and figure out there's nothing
[2:14:18.640 --> 2:14:23.200]  trendy about this when the fortune 100 is behind global taxes you better run for
[2:14:23.200 --> 2:14:27.680]  the hills when the eugenics elite is for this you better wake up alright Bob
[2:14:27.680 --> 2:14:30.880]  Chapman with us for the rest of the hour Bob thanks for holding on I finished up
[2:14:30.880 --> 2:14:36.280]  that key breakdown speak in detail from your 45 years of fighting the globalist
[2:14:36.280 --> 2:14:39.480]  formerly army intelligence one of the biggest silver and gold brokers in
[2:14:39.480 --> 2:14:43.560]  history private brokers the number one newsletter until you retired you've now
[2:14:43.560 --> 2:14:48.040]  come back to fight these people from your study of the New World Order is what I
[2:14:48.040 --> 2:14:51.560]  said accurate and why do you think they're coming out announcing one child
[2:14:51.560 --> 2:14:56.160]  policy global dictatorship forced abortion in the US and Canada and Europe
[2:14:56.160 --> 2:15:01.800]  cps taking almost all the children it's all being announced sir no longer in the
[2:15:01.800 --> 2:15:08.160]  in the in the documents now publicly Bob Chapman well that's exactly the way it
[2:15:08.160 --> 2:15:13.640]  is and as an evolutionary process I am a handful of others have been talking
[2:15:13.640 --> 2:15:19.440]  about it for 50 years and it's here and now I could have not said it any more
[2:15:19.440 --> 2:15:27.600]  fully or any better than what you have I heard you yesterday or earlier in
[2:15:27.600 --> 2:15:34.000]  today I I think it was earlier today and one of the things that you touched on
[2:15:34.000 --> 2:15:42.400]  that you didn't touch on this morning was the taxing attempt of formulating a new
[2:15:42.400 --> 2:15:51.040]  currency to be based on on carbon taxes and this is the strongly one of the
[2:15:51.040 --> 2:15:59.160]  ways that they want to entrap people the taxation and a new world currency but
[2:15:59.160 --> 2:16:08.760]  based upon carbon and I think we may have stopped them what we won't know for a
[2:16:08.760 --> 2:16:15.080]  few months yet but you've been very close to a closer than I to what's
[2:16:15.080 --> 2:16:23.720]  happening in Copenhagen and they are conducting themselves at the meeting
[2:16:23.720 --> 2:16:31.840]  like nobody ever heard about climate gait and the release of the emails that
[2:16:31.840 --> 2:16:38.960]  identified them for creating global warming as a fraud and a roost they
[2:16:38.960 --> 2:16:43.920]  just going ahead full steam doing what they want to do and as you said in
[2:16:43.920 --> 2:16:49.680]  regard to the president in signing the document to try to enforce that the
[2:16:49.680 --> 2:16:57.320]  United States and bypassing the the House and the Senate and and essentially
[2:16:57.320 --> 2:17:02.760]  setting himself up as a dictator and committing high treason that's her
[2:17:02.760 --> 2:17:05.960]  that's her attitude this thing they think they can get away with anything and
[2:17:05.960 --> 2:17:11.920]  one of the things that they should that they missed I think is they think they
[2:17:11.920 --> 2:17:16.200]  control the military and they don't and I think they're gonna find that they're
[2:17:16.200 --> 2:17:19.880]  gonna push a little bit too far along the way here and that's gonna be in the
[2:17:19.880 --> 2:17:26.960]  next year or two and everything's gonna break loose well the key is when when
[2:17:26.960 --> 2:17:30.840]  you got government documents 45 years ago I got government documents 14 years
[2:17:30.840 --> 2:17:34.880]  ago we didn't just sit here and shut up because the media called us cooks we
[2:17:34.880 --> 2:17:39.560]  would hold up the official IMF World Bank UN plans so we've warned you've
[2:17:39.560 --> 2:17:44.200]  probably done 10 20 30,000 interviews what do you do 5 6 7 a day for 30 40
[2:17:44.200 --> 2:17:47.800]  years I I mean I've been reaching hundreds of millions of people over the
[2:17:47.800 --> 2:17:52.160]  years my films alone seen over a hundred plus million times on YouTube and
[2:17:52.160 --> 2:17:56.280]  Google that's publicly the you know the newspapers report that with horror that
[2:17:56.280 --> 2:18:00.480]  were so effective so we warned everybody now everything we said what
[2:18:00.480 --> 2:18:04.720]  happened happened exactly as we said not because we have crystal balls we were
[2:18:04.720 --> 2:18:10.000]  reading their own documents now people are freaking out and listening and so
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:13.800]  we're beginning to get the momentum Ron Paul said his audit the feds gonna pass
[2:18:13.800 --> 2:18:18.160]  the house today I mean we are devastating them thanks to the fact that we
[2:18:18.160 --> 2:18:22.520]  didn't care about being demonized or laughed at Bob that's right and we're
[2:18:22.520 --> 2:18:25.920]  gonna keep right on doing it and sticking it to them and we're going to
[2:18:25.920 --> 2:18:31.080]  win but we got to have the help of the public they've got to get with us they
[2:18:31.080 --> 2:18:35.920]  have to take the information that they that we have and go to their elected
[2:18:35.920 --> 2:18:40.120]  director of representatives especially at the lower levels and the count of the
[2:18:40.120 --> 2:18:45.800]  the city councils and county councils and mayors and alderman and and and and
[2:18:45.800 --> 2:18:51.080]  and state representatives go to sovereignty push the government push
[2:18:51.080 --> 2:18:58.080]  him right to the edge push Wall Street right to the edge we have to continue to
[2:18:58.080 --> 2:19:03.840]  identify the enemy I mean how bold is it how incredible is it for you to see
[2:19:03.840 --> 2:19:08.200]  them openly come out admit global government openly come out and say
[2:19:08.200 --> 2:19:14.720]  world government planetary one-child tax take your children by law openly being
[2:19:14.720 --> 2:19:18.840]  announced by the Chinese delegation they own our debt to see them openly
[2:19:18.840 --> 2:19:23.920]  announcing a global control over all transportation a UN authority a 2% tax
[2:19:23.920 --> 2:19:29.480]  on all GDP of countries hundreds of taxes on all human activity 700 plus new
[2:19:29.480 --> 2:19:36.000]  UN bureaucracies I mean this is amazing it certainly is and they're going for it
[2:19:36.000 --> 2:19:41.320]  because they don't have any other choice they took the program forward they
[2:19:41.320 --> 2:19:46.560]  made a big mistake they couldn't stop and they can't stop anymore now that I
[2:19:46.560 --> 2:19:53.200]  could that and if they don't go forward they're gonna be gobbled up anyway very
[2:19:53.200 --> 2:19:58.040]  well said Bob Chapman let's continue to break this down on the other side of
[2:19:58.040 --> 2:20:01.920]  this quick break this is the one the only GCN radio network I'm Alex Jones
[2:20:01.920 --> 2:20:05.320]  your call straight out have a mortgage and a load of other debt wouldn't it be
[2:20:05.320 --> 2:20:08.920]  great if it all just went away no more mortgage can change your life we paid
[2:20:08.920 --> 2:20:12.120]  off all of our bills all your debt including your mortgage in as little as

[2:22:01.320 --> 2:22:05.240]  hello Ted Anderson listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal
[2:22:05.240 --> 2:22:08.960]  Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending therefore with
[2:22:08.960 --> 2:22:12.520]  catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently
[2:22:12.520 --> 2:22:15.600]  placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their
[2:22:15.600 --> 2:22:19.360]  accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your
[2:22:19.360 --> 2:22:22.760]  deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending will
[2:22:22.760 --> 2:22:26.720]  skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a
[2:22:26.720 --> 2:22:31.040]  bank run followed by a depressed economy a current effort is underway by the Fed
[2:22:31.040 --> 2:22:34.480]  along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors
[2:22:34.480 --> 2:22:38.320]  however an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity
[2:22:38.320 --> 2:22:42.720]  can cause inflation in order to achieve strength and stability I recommend a
[2:22:42.720 --> 2:22:47.120]  conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and
[2:22:47.120 --> 2:22:51.800]  silver while paper investments currently have been driven by debt gold on its own

[2:23:57.760 --> 2:24:11.040]  today your calls coming up in the next segment we'll get into the economy but
[2:24:11.040 --> 2:24:18.240]  this is the economy the IMF and World Bank in the leaked Danish text the real
[2:24:18.240 --> 2:24:21.520]  version that's in the text of what they're going to introduce next week they
[2:24:21.520 --> 2:24:25.960]  were going to keep it secret it came out three days ago to double or right at
[2:24:25.960 --> 2:24:29.760]  double the taxes on the third world over what the West has to pay they suckered
[2:24:29.760 --> 2:24:33.120]  the third world into getting behind the treaty telling them oh you're going to
[2:24:33.120 --> 2:24:36.560]  get America's money you're going to get Europe and Britain and Japan's money no
[2:24:36.560 --> 2:24:41.960]  the banks get our money and the banks get your money okay you understand they
[2:24:41.960 --> 2:24:46.360]  always play us off against each other divide and conquer and in there it
[2:24:46.360 --> 2:24:51.360]  states the World Bank and IMF will get all the money totally dictatorial the
[2:24:51.360 --> 2:24:57.520]  country signed their sovereignty in a treaty in a contract away and Obama
[2:24:57.520 --> 2:25:02.720]  said three days ago in Associated Press they said if the Senate doesn't ratify
[2:25:02.720 --> 2:25:09.000]  this I will implement it by executive fiat quote command and control and then
[2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:15.200]  now here's another headline now EU wants global transaction tax to fund bailouts
[2:25:15.200 --> 2:25:21.600]  a direct transaction tax to the private banks I mean Bob this is just like made
[2:25:21.600 --> 2:25:25.120]  off declaring himself king or something and everyone bowing down made off of
[2:25:25.120 --> 2:25:28.880]  course was involved in this the highest levels with Ken lay I mean this is so
[2:25:28.880 --> 2:25:35.160]  criminal this is so openly criminal how does anyone go along with it Bob well
[2:25:35.160 --> 2:25:38.520]  they don't want what they want once they find out in that what that is is a
[2:25:38.520 --> 2:25:44.760]  transaction tax and that is on securities transactions and they've had that
[2:25:44.760 --> 2:25:50.280]  in the United States before during the 1960s they had such attacks and it's
[2:25:50.280 --> 2:25:56.520]  just another way of raising revenue and and it's not good of course people you
[2:25:56.520 --> 2:26:02.080]  know don't need to pay any more taxes anywhere for that matter and yes they
[2:26:02.080 --> 2:26:12.840]  also are allowing the the rich country so to speak to emit 2.67 tons of carbon
[2:26:12.840 --> 2:26:20.280]  per day but the third world countries can only emit 1.44 tons per day which is
[2:26:20.280 --> 2:26:27.840]  about per person per year yeah yeah and and you know as George always said some
[2:26:27.840 --> 2:26:34.240]  are more equal than others and that this is so totally chauvinistic and as you
[2:26:34.240 --> 2:26:39.200]  say diabolical and it's being sold as liberal to help Africa when it will
[2:26:39.200 --> 2:26:43.600]  admittedly kill them in mass these people are on the edge of starvation this
[2:26:43.600 --> 2:26:48.920]  will kill them the ethanol scam killed 10 million extra last year and then
[2:26:48.920 --> 2:26:53.440]  here's George Soros climate colonialism Soros wants poor nations to take on
[2:26:53.440 --> 2:26:58.760]  green debt so Soros gets our tax money literally paid to him in Elgore then
[2:26:58.760 --> 2:27:03.160]  they loan it loan sharking rates to the third world and they don't even get the
[2:27:03.160 --> 2:27:06.280]  money if they don't sterilize people I mean can you think of something more
[2:27:06.280 --> 2:27:12.480]  evil Bob no and that you know at the the Gore family made their money with
[2:27:12.480 --> 2:27:19.360]  Armand Hammer and after the wall came down the the the records of the Soviet
[2:27:19.360 --> 2:27:27.000]  Union became public and the Armand Hammer was identified by the former
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:33.360]  Soviets as a secret agent going back into the 1920s he was a KGB agent so the
[2:27:33.360 --> 2:27:40.400]  Gore family made their wealth by being involved in business deals with other
[2:27:40.400 --> 2:27:45.200]  Marxist but at a higher level correct me if I'm wrong it's been declassified now
[2:27:45.200 --> 2:27:49.800]  McCarthy was right he found out that the army was running it and the banks were
[2:27:49.800 --> 2:27:53.760]  running it they just created the communists as a renomab to go rob the
[2:27:53.760 --> 2:27:58.240]  czars and the people and make them slaves and call it revolution and so
[2:27:58.240 --> 2:28:03.960]  hammer was actually just working for the globalist that's right and I had met him
[2:28:03.960 --> 2:28:07.880]  many times because I was in the brokerages is in Los Angeles and he
[2:28:07.880 --> 2:28:12.320]  would always be coming around with a dog and pony show about
[2:28:12.320 --> 2:28:16.960]  accidental petroleum petroleum so and I knew what he was doing at the time but
[2:28:16.960 --> 2:28:20.680]  I never brought it up in the meetings because I would be the only voice and
[2:28:20.680 --> 2:28:24.920]  everybody would look at me and say you're nuts and of course that wasn't
[2:28:24.920 --> 2:28:34.560]  true and now we're proving all that the George Soros and I don't know the the
[2:28:34.560 --> 2:28:42.240]  listeners know his background but as a teenager he was a Hungarian Jew and he
[2:28:42.240 --> 2:28:47.680]  passed himself off as being non-Jewish and he worked with the Gestapo
[2:28:47.680 --> 2:28:55.400]  collecting other Jews to send him off to be exterminated and what they would do
[2:28:55.400 --> 2:29:00.960]  is steal all the belongings that belong to these poor people and they would
[2:29:00.960 --> 2:29:08.000]  divvy it up among the the Gestapo people and him and others who helped him and so
[2:29:08.000 --> 2:29:12.640]  that's how George got his start unbelievable you know let's talk about
[2:29:12.640 --> 2:29:16.360]  that a little bit more an arm and hammer wait a minute wait a minute Alex he's
[2:29:16.360 --> 2:29:21.640]  been convicted of stock fraud twice and once in Paris and he appealed the
[2:29:21.640 --> 2:29:26.640]  decision and they threw the appeal out and just recently in the last year he
[2:29:26.640 --> 2:29:32.160]  was convicted of stock fraud and in both instances paid large fines well stay

[2:34:54.920 --> 2:35:00.000]  said had been convicted twice of stock fraud and this is in recent times this
[2:35:00.000 --> 2:35:06.960]  is not 30 or 40 years ago and he was the one who was given the inside
[2:35:06.960 --> 2:35:16.200]  information in the early 1990s by the the the royal family that the pound was
[2:35:16.200 --> 2:35:22.200]  going to break away from the European currencies and the result would be that
[2:35:22.200 --> 2:35:28.240]  the pound would fall in value and so George short of the pound made billions
[2:35:28.240 --> 2:35:35.240]  of millions of dollars these people don't make money because they're extra
[2:35:35.240 --> 2:35:42.000]  smart they all have inside information and that's a very good example of it and
[2:35:42.000 --> 2:35:46.520]  in the United States today Warren Buffett's another one you know he's brought
[2:35:46.520 --> 2:35:51.200]  around like the Grand Puba and the all-knowing one when in fact most of
[2:35:51.200 --> 2:35:56.120]  his deals are either in collaboration with the US government or directly with
[2:35:56.120 --> 2:36:00.800]  the US government the reason that he just recently bought the railroad was to
[2:36:00.800 --> 2:36:07.960]  get carbon credits so that he could engage in the carbon trading and
[2:36:07.960 --> 2:36:13.480]  incidentally in Europe they're already doing carbon trading and they have a
[2:36:13.480 --> 2:36:21.080]  big scandal going on about how the carbon rates are all fixed and everybody's
[2:36:21.080 --> 2:36:25.960]  getting ripped off and it'll be in tomorrow's issue of the forecaster but
[2:36:25.960 --> 2:36:32.080]  getting back to Soros he also and when these people died people like Soros
[2:36:32.080 --> 2:36:37.040]  their wealth is then turned over to the Illuminati and I've seen it happen
[2:36:37.040 --> 2:36:41.000]  time and time again and so they got a good will or here they do what they're
[2:36:41.000 --> 2:36:51.080]  supposed to do and and they live powerful and luxurious lives the Soros
[2:36:51.080 --> 2:36:57.120]  used a good part of his money to format these revolutions in all these
[2:36:57.120 --> 2:37:02.040]  Eastern European countries the Pink Revolution the Blue Revolution whatever
[2:37:02.040 --> 2:37:07.760]  they were called and that was his money doing that and he also has the has been
[2:37:07.760 --> 2:37:13.320]  the biggest proponent for the legal use of marijuana and he's been pushing it
[2:37:13.320 --> 2:37:19.680]  for some years as far as Albright's concerned yes your father was a first
[2:37:19.680 --> 2:37:24.960]  class crook but you know he's one of the families and it was interesting that
[2:37:24.960 --> 2:37:31.600]  probably about ten years ago as she just discovered that she was Jewish and so
[2:37:31.600 --> 2:37:35.440]  that was no revelation because she knew from the beginning and where did they
[2:37:35.440 --> 2:37:39.640]  get all of the art wealth that they had they took it off all from Jewish people
[2:37:39.640 --> 2:37:49.240]  and so she and her father just like the Gores and and the Soros is and and
[2:37:49.240 --> 2:37:56.440]  others have gleaned this tremendous amount of wealth by doing exactly what
[2:37:56.440 --> 2:38:00.200]  the Illuminati want them to do whether it's within the communist structure of
[2:38:00.200 --> 2:38:06.160]  the fascist structure of the socialist structure etc that they have their
[2:38:06.160 --> 2:38:10.800]  mission they're told what to do and they get their orders and training and
[2:38:10.800 --> 2:38:17.840]  information from foundations and think tanks which are funded by these people
[2:38:17.840 --> 2:38:24.360]  and so the way I envision it they say look here's the syllabus you study it
[2:38:24.360 --> 2:38:28.440]  this is what you've got to do and for that you'll get you know 80 billion
[2:38:28.440 --> 2:38:32.400]  dollars or whatever the figure is and this is the way this thing works and
[2:38:32.400 --> 2:38:40.080]  it's it warms its way all over the world into companies and governments and
[2:38:40.080 --> 2:38:45.960]  banking and not everybody in banking and in the brokerage industry or the
[2:38:45.960 --> 2:38:52.160]  insurance industry or are in manufacturing or whatever throughout the
[2:38:52.160 --> 2:38:56.800]  world are involved in this there's a lot of good people out there and a lot of
[2:38:56.800 --> 2:39:01.680]  people who are invited to join groups like the council and foreign relations
[2:39:01.680 --> 2:39:06.800]  and the group of 30 and the group of 300 and the trilateral commission and the
[2:39:06.800 --> 2:39:15.040]  builder burgers and and and on and on and on some of them get out but not many
[2:39:15.040 --> 2:39:22.600]  I mean the power and the money is so fabulous that these people can't help
[2:39:22.600 --> 2:39:32.360]  themselves and so going back to hammer him his father was a high official in
[2:39:32.360 --> 2:39:35.280]  the Communist Party in the United States who wasn't called that
[2:39:35.280 --> 2:39:41.360]  eventually he was called a communist hammer always said that he wasn't a
[2:39:41.360 --> 2:39:48.760]  communist and of course he was and this is a number of books on his history and
[2:39:48.760 --> 2:39:56.080]  he had this large oil concession in Libya and he got that by paying off for it
[2:39:56.080 --> 2:40:01.040]  which is illegal of course the same thing that Halliburton just got caught
[2:40:01.040 --> 2:40:06.040]  doing I mean you got to understand that these people are all in this together
[2:40:06.040 --> 2:40:13.160]  and they buy the politicians in every country they create revolutions they
[2:40:13.160 --> 2:40:19.680]  create wars then you know like America they never seen a dictator that they
[2:40:19.680 --> 2:40:26.640]  didn't like look look at the schools that they had at Fort Benning still
[2:40:26.640 --> 2:40:32.320]  there under a new name but Bob that's a great point you make that that look at
[2:40:32.320 --> 2:40:36.120]  how our government sets up dictatorships all over the world of course they're
[2:40:36.120 --> 2:40:39.560]  getting rid of North com of course they're putting police on the street the
[2:40:39.560 --> 2:40:45.480]  federal government today financed a paper by Rand to create a new U.S. Army
[2:40:45.480 --> 2:40:48.800]  police force now we know they're going to put regular army on the streets and
[2:40:48.800 --> 2:40:51.680]  are already doing it but now they're announcing no we're gonna have federal
[2:40:51.680 --> 2:40:56.840]  U.S. Army troops and they're just gonna patrol America and they're gonna write
[2:40:56.840 --> 2:41:02.000]  tickets and everything I mean that's total Guatemala total Stalin Russia I
[2:41:02.000 --> 2:41:07.120]  mean that's great a certified it's just totally illegitimate criminal government
[2:41:07.120 --> 2:41:10.240]  and you say well the military will stand up and I know the military are really
[2:41:10.240 --> 2:41:13.920]  tuning in in droves they're waking up they know previously they were taught
[2:41:13.920 --> 2:41:18.040]  this was bad now they're being told it's good but they're having Marine Corps
[2:41:18.040 --> 2:41:23.000]  Army National Guard where they run checkpoints in Tennessee California Texas
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:28.120]  Iowa they do gun confiscation drills it's now in the paper and the troops go
[2:41:28.120 --> 2:41:31.920]  yeah I'm out here running checkpoints for drugs I mean what's wrong with stopping
[2:41:31.920 --> 2:41:37.200]  drugs just to set the precedent and so they're certainly trying to do this and
[2:41:37.200 --> 2:41:41.820]  using stage terror attacks to sell it and conservatives have been sold well
[2:41:41.820 --> 2:41:45.560]  it's anti-terror I'm for it but conservatives need to know we got the
[2:41:45.560 --> 2:41:49.560]  Mayak report from the police we released it we got the homeland security
[2:41:49.560 --> 2:41:53.480]  report I got it I released it people couldn't believe it was real for two
[2:41:53.480 --> 2:41:58.040]  days until the feds admitted yes Jones shouldn't have that and I had the feds
[2:41:58.040 --> 2:42:01.960]  calling up saying who gave that to you and I said go take a hike buddy it's still
[2:42:01.960 --> 2:42:07.280]  America and it said homeland security is for the American people gun owners
[2:42:07.280 --> 2:42:11.880]  veterans conservatives libertarians people that protests the Fed we always
[2:42:11.880 --> 2:42:16.640]  knew it was for us because we're the real Americans we're the good guys
[2:42:16.640 --> 2:42:23.160]  homeland security is to stop the good guys Bob Chapman well you're absolutely
[2:42:23.160 --> 2:42:28.680]  right and that's the federalization process and that will sweep through all
[2:42:28.680 --> 2:42:34.280]  of the police departments and and and and eventually through all the state
[2:42:34.280 --> 2:42:41.360]  agencies this is monstrous what's going on and you know the American people who
[2:42:41.360 --> 2:42:46.440]  are listening to this you have got to tell other people about this you have
[2:42:46.440 --> 2:42:50.400]  to talk about it in all the meetings that you're having politically at the
[2:42:50.400 --> 2:42:56.080]  lower levels in the state and cities in the towns and you have to continually
[2:42:56.080 --> 2:43:01.520]  barrage all the congressmen all the senators and tell them you don't want to
[2:43:01.520 --> 2:43:06.080]  them do this and don't want them to do that you know it's the only legal
[2:43:06.080 --> 2:43:11.600]  avenue open to you and if you can you should group you go with these groups
[2:43:11.600 --> 2:43:18.520]  that meet and go to Washington and what was it two million people tea parties
[2:43:18.520 --> 2:43:23.200]  other kinds of groups all over the country if you don't do it you're going
[2:43:23.200 --> 2:43:29.160]  to end up in an internment camp and by the way Bob you were in army intelligence
[2:43:29.160 --> 2:43:33.640]  in Europe against the Soviets you've lived in Paris you've lived in South
[2:43:33.640 --> 2:43:38.280]  Africa you've lived and did a lot of work in black ops and that's how you
[2:43:38.280 --> 2:43:42.520]  discovered the new world order people that study history like you and I who
[2:43:42.520 --> 2:43:47.240]  spend all our time researching this and you've lived it know what type of
[2:43:47.240 --> 2:43:51.000]  tyranny we're dealing with it's not a boss hog it's not a corruption it's not
[2:43:51.000 --> 2:43:57.360]  a good old boy thing it is a scientific focused final solution to bring in an
[2:43:57.360 --> 2:44:02.840]  invincible scientific dictatorship this is their own statements a planetary
[2:44:02.840 --> 2:44:06.920]  regime the likes of which we've never seen people need to know this is the
[2:44:06.920 --> 2:44:13.400]  darkest most wicked form of tyranny you can imagine and these people are truly
[2:44:13.400 --> 2:44:26.240]  demented they are they are truly truly truly truly demented and people need to
[2:44:26.240 --> 2:44:30.840]  understand this is life and death folks they're putting in the face scanners the
[2:44:30.840 --> 2:44:34.640]  the license plate readers are already in they're already tracking everything
[2:44:34.640 --> 2:44:39.560]  they're already admitting their service I mean it's just it's hell I mean it and
[2:44:39.560 --> 2:44:44.880]  the military and police listening folks they are spiking your vaccines and
[2:44:44.880 --> 2:44:51.160]  water Bob you want to explain that to them well they've been doing it for a
[2:44:51.160 --> 2:44:55.600]  long time it just we didn't know about it and if they can put chlorine in they
[2:44:55.600 --> 2:45:00.080]  can put anything else in it as Alex said earlier they're getting all kinds of
[2:45:00.080 --> 2:45:07.200]  drugs in bodies of water that are nowhere near pollution that are used for
[2:45:07.200 --> 2:45:13.680]  drinking water and they're hitting these reservoirs and and and the feed is to
[2:45:13.680 --> 2:45:22.440]  reservoirs before the water ever gets to be processed I don't know what they're
[2:45:22.440 --> 2:45:26.600]  doing with the private water as far as bottled water is concerned do you know
[2:45:26.600 --> 2:45:31.840]  that Alex well they picked a plastic in the 50s out of thousands of formulae
[2:45:31.840 --> 2:45:36.600]  the only type that sluffs massive estrogen mimicry and that's a fact they
[2:45:36.600 --> 2:45:42.320]  admit that in fact people won't believe it just Google plastics sterilizing
[2:45:42.320 --> 2:45:50.640]  plastics sterilizing men or or plastics releasing in estrogen mimicers and
[2:45:50.640 --> 2:45:55.000]  you'll get thousands of articles it's admitted here's one out of CBS news and
[2:45:55.000 --> 2:46:01.120]  this is a whitewash remember that mutant polio virus spreads in Nigeria 124
[2:46:01.120 --> 2:46:05.200]  children affected I looked up the actual number it was tens of thousands this
[2:46:05.200 --> 2:46:10.160]  year by paralyzing disease believed to be caused by same vaccine used to fight it
[2:46:10.160 --> 2:46:15.520]  oh it's an accident but then you pull it up dozens and dozens of countries with
[2:46:15.520 --> 2:46:24.240]  weaponized polio vaccine killing and maiming the children and you know there
[2:46:24.240 --> 2:46:32.600]  is a an enormous a group of people who are involved in this conspiracy and
[2:46:32.600 --> 2:46:39.960]  that's exactly what it is who are pedophiles and other deviants again the
[2:46:39.960 --> 2:46:43.720]  U.S. been caught hundreds of articles everywhere they go they run child
[2:46:43.720 --> 2:46:48.720]  kidnapping rings go ahead and what they what what they want to do in
[2:46:48.720 --> 2:46:53.320]  eventually controlling you will be able to control your children so that they
[2:46:53.320 --> 2:47:01.440]  can use them as they want to and it is so rampant it's unbelievable you know I
[2:47:01.440 --> 2:47:09.520]  went to Rome one time they wanted me to take over the observatory Romano and
[2:47:09.520 --> 2:47:14.720]  of course I at that time I didn't know anything about how to run a newspaper and
[2:47:14.720 --> 2:47:20.520]  the and the editor had died and his wife was running it and they wanted myself
[2:47:20.520 --> 2:47:27.160]  and somebody else to run the paper and front page of the paper Henry Kissinger
[2:47:27.160 --> 2:47:32.600]  is in town hide your children I'll never forget it of course you wouldn't see
[2:47:32.600 --> 2:47:37.600]  that kind of a headline in the United States but Kissinger is a famous
[2:47:37.600 --> 2:47:43.600]  pedophile as is Gordon Brown and the bushes and I could go on and on there's
[2:47:43.600 --> 2:47:50.600]  millions of them and they'll have a field day with children once they are able
[2:47:50.600 --> 2:47:55.120]  to take over and so that's what is in the future for your children and
[2:47:55.120 --> 2:48:01.520]  grandchildren devastating information devastating information with Bob Chapman
[2:48:01.520 --> 2:48:04.360]  my my goodness it was coming from anybody else I wouldn't know what to say
[2:48:04.360 --> 2:48:08.000]  coming from him I don't know what to say but I've been to Bohemian Grove I know
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:12.200]  about skull and bones and the sky's the limit for these people let's take some
[2:48:12.200 --> 2:48:17.560]  calls Lee in Minnesota thanks for holding her on the air hey Alex hi Bob
[2:48:17.560 --> 2:48:22.360]  great show I don't I don't know how I get anything done Bob is great to listen
[2:48:22.360 --> 2:48:29.600]  to you I did want to comment on on on something about Ron Paul and HR 1207 I
[2:48:29.600 --> 2:48:37.440]  just finished or finishing up a macroeconomics class and I believe I'll
[2:48:37.440 --> 2:48:44.520]  be getting an A or a B and I've been trying to get the teacher to understand
[2:48:44.520 --> 2:48:53.680]  HR 1207 and the importance of auditing the Federal Reserve I just got a message
[2:48:53.680 --> 2:48:59.040]  from him and I've I've get a chance to write some closing comments for the rest
[2:48:59.040 --> 2:49:07.320]  of the students and the teacher to see any suggestions on a short little blur
[2:49:07.320 --> 2:49:13.760]  to to to write down so people we don't really know what your papers about so
[2:49:13.760 --> 2:49:21.200]  it's hard for us to help you it's just about it's about macroeconomics in in
[2:49:21.200 --> 2:49:26.680]  what's going on in in Africa I would give them Tom Thomas Jefferson quote
[2:49:26.680 --> 2:49:31.120]  about if we ever allow private banks to take over the issuance of currency and
[2:49:31.120 --> 2:49:36.680]  credit our children will wake up homeless on the continent we conquered and I
[2:49:36.680 --> 2:49:40.560]  would give them some some some quotes by Jefferson about everything is the
[2:49:40.560 --> 2:49:44.440]  money power this parasitic system that if you took all the power away from the
[2:49:44.440 --> 2:49:49.160]  bankers today tomorrow they would write themselves a new fiat check for the rest
[2:49:49.160 --> 2:49:55.000]  of the world Bob Chapman well he was exactly right and that was a long time
[2:49:55.000 --> 2:50:01.920]  ago and so we're fighting this enemy for over a thousand years and you know when
[2:50:01.920 --> 2:50:07.440]  I say that and Alex says it people say well gee that couldn't be you know tell
[2:50:07.440 --> 2:50:11.440]  us about it and but you know it's not something you can capitalize in five
[2:50:11.440 --> 2:50:15.400]  minutes you have to go back and study it yourself either you're gonna have to
[2:50:15.400 --> 2:50:19.040]  take our word for it and that's why we're on the air because we're here to
[2:50:19.040 --> 2:50:22.800]  help you we're not selling anything we're not doing anything we're just
[2:50:22.800 --> 2:50:27.360]  saying look this is what's going on you you've got to become aware of it you
[2:50:27.360 --> 2:50:31.240]  have to do something about it if you don't you're not gonna like the way
[2:50:31.240 --> 2:50:34.800]  that you're gonna have to live in the future and all you have to do is read
[2:50:34.800 --> 2:50:39.520]  the publications and the announcements of the people who are involved in this
[2:50:39.520 --> 2:50:44.120]  and you'll get the message and you've got to let Congress and you get to let
[2:50:44.120 --> 2:50:49.440]  everybody in politics know that you know what they're doing or you know what
[2:50:49.440 --> 2:50:55.440]  they should be doing to stop this absolutely get up and arms you gotta
[2:50:55.440 --> 2:50:59.800]  get angry folks we planetary government is being set up by people that want to
[2:50:59.800 --> 2:51:05.880]  cut your resources off and kill you this is an emergency alert more than half
[2:51:05.880 --> 2:51:10.000]  the world's doctors and nurses are refusing risky vaccinations this fall
[2:51:10.000 --> 2:51:15.560]  I'm dr. Leonard Horowitz a Harvard trained public health expert urging you
[2:51:15.560 --> 2:51:21.560]  to avoid risky vaccinations especially this flu season rely on oxy silver
[2:51:21.560 --> 2:51:26.680]  instead oxy silver's broad spectrum action makes all vaccinations and

[2:54:14.280 --> 2:54:21.320]  more calls of course awesome let's go to David in Georgia you're on the air go
[2:54:21.320 --> 2:54:28.680]  ahead hello I was watching something on democracy now where they were talking
[2:54:28.680 --> 2:54:33.760]  about this lady named Ivan Yanez who heads up group called Action Ecologica
[2:54:33.760 --> 2:54:37.440]  I'll preface this by saying they're a lot of bad guys in mining but this is
[2:54:37.440 --> 2:54:43.000]  getting crazy she proposes that they have a program called keep the oil in
[2:54:43.000 --> 2:54:51.840]  the soil and that Ecuador or some NGO receive money so that they don't
[2:54:51.840 --> 2:54:56.280]  produce oil it's not no that's what George Soros is saying they will give
[2:54:56.280 --> 2:55:00.720]  payoffs to the governments not to develop and not to bring resources out
[2:55:00.720 --> 2:55:04.440]  because then it creates artificial scarcity because the globalist already
[2:55:04.440 --> 2:55:10.000]  control most the resources so by shutting down other people remember Bill
[2:55:10.000 --> 2:55:16.680]  Clinton in 1996-97 the only clean burning coal in North America was in
[2:55:16.680 --> 2:55:20.640]  Utah in just a small area but tons of it enough to run the US for over a hundred
[2:55:20.640 --> 2:55:25.200]  years and he signed an executive order for the environment to block that that
[2:55:25.200 --> 2:55:29.760]  made Chinese coal that he and others owned part of the only other big place
[2:55:29.760 --> 2:55:33.800]  in the world to have this clean coal with with because it's much cheaper to burn
[2:55:33.800 --> 2:55:38.640]  because your scrubbers don't have to be as complex to get the mercury and other
[2:55:38.640 --> 2:55:47.040]  phosphates what's the yellow colored chemical sulfur to scrub that out and
[2:55:47.040 --> 2:55:51.800]  so see by making that coal off limits that more than doubled the Chinese coal
[2:55:51.800 --> 2:55:55.760]  Bob Chapman you want to comment on this well it's exactly the way it happened
[2:55:55.760 --> 2:56:00.960]  and that was a gift to the Chinese and of course they get paid off I mean the
[2:56:00.960 --> 2:56:06.440]  the the skullduggery that has gone on is just incredible I mean these are the
[2:56:06.440 --> 2:56:10.360]  inside stories that you're just not going to get from the major media which
[2:56:10.360 --> 2:56:14.240]  these people own and of course a useful idiot like Robert Redford that went out
[2:56:14.240 --> 2:56:18.640]  there and stopped it from happening he goes home and feels good he doesn't know
[2:56:18.640 --> 2:56:22.880]  that he's contributing to energy loss and genocide worldwide because this hurts
[2:56:22.880 --> 2:56:29.920]  the third world the worst go ahead well I think there are a lot of people in the
[2:56:29.920 --> 2:56:37.080]  environmental and green area that mean very very well but they just don't
[2:56:37.080 --> 2:56:40.840]  understand some of the things that we do and when you tell them most of them
[2:56:40.840 --> 2:56:45.240]  don't want to listen unfortunately I mean they're steadfast in what they
[2:56:45.240 --> 2:56:51.440]  believe in and I think they should be more selective and it's a shame because
[2:56:51.440 --> 2:56:56.400]  when you have a big name because you're a movie star or something of that sort
[2:56:56.400 --> 2:57:01.440]  people tend to listen to you whether you're qualified or not David anything
[2:57:01.440 --> 2:57:06.720]  else yes sir I remember that there was this company called Gabriel resources
[2:57:06.720 --> 2:57:12.080]  they had this huge mountain in Romania it's been used since from an empire it's
[2:57:12.080 --> 2:57:17.600]  already a brownfield area and they toward they have these George Soros NGOs
[2:57:17.600 --> 2:57:22.320]  lobbying the Romanian government not to get it developed and these NGOs have
[2:57:22.320 --> 2:57:26.480]  associations with Hungary and Hungary feels entitled to land in Romania where
[2:57:26.480 --> 2:57:32.040]  this gold lies and you go talk to the residents near them a potential mind they
[2:57:32.040 --> 2:57:37.320]  all want the mind they need the money they're poor their girlfriends need
[2:57:37.320 --> 2:57:42.680]  consumer goods the boyfriends are lonely I it there's a film called mine your own
[2:57:42.680 --> 2:57:47.080]  business talked about let's see what Soros will do is when and they did this in
[2:57:47.080 --> 2:57:51.280]  Austin some of the same groups they come in and say you can't build on this
[2:57:51.280 --> 2:57:55.560]  15,000 acres owned by 20 something ranchers we're not gonna let you build
[2:57:55.560 --> 2:58:00.280]  on it the property value falls by 95% then they come back five years later and
[2:58:00.280 --> 2:58:05.120]  they say we'll give you 10 cents on the dollar for the land and then as soon as
[2:58:05.120 --> 2:58:10.520]  they have it the the the mayor that did it opens his own bank and gives the land
[2:58:10.520 --> 2:58:15.640]  to himself publicly makes made-off look like a sand then just openly builds
[2:58:15.640 --> 2:58:19.080]  hotels and houses on it and if you don't like it a swat team will drop by and
[2:58:19.080 --> 2:58:22.360]  murder you and your family bring it up that's how it works here in Austin it's
[2:58:22.360 --> 2:58:27.120]  like we rule you we own you you are slaves we have weapons we have men in

[3:00:02.120 --> 3:00:18.520]  I mean it's really tough watching criminals run wild and steal land and
[3:00:18.520 --> 3:00:22.840]  property of people's children and spike the water supply and openly announced
[3:00:22.840 --> 3:00:28.200]  they're gonna cut off our resources and arrest you if you have more than one
[3:00:28.200 --> 3:00:32.360]  child and enforce it to the Chinese model and our government praising the
[3:00:32.360 --> 3:00:36.120]  Chinese model notice Bob Chapman overnight we've gone from decrying
[3:00:36.120 --> 3:00:41.080]  China's secret arrest and infanticide and taking political dissidents organs
[3:00:41.080 --> 3:00:45.200]  which is all admitted to suddenly just saying none of it exists China's
[3:00:45.200 --> 3:00:49.960]  wonderful we love China they've been positioned to be the muscle for the New
[3:00:49.960 --> 3:00:53.600]  World Order do you agree with that statement I think that's a good one and
[3:00:53.600 --> 3:00:58.560]  I would think that if there's disruption in the United States they would be the
[3:00:58.560 --> 3:01:03.920]  first ones who would be called to bring in troops and by the way if people can't
[3:01:03.920 --> 3:01:10.040]  believe that NLE09 four months ago FEMA just Google NLE national level
[3:01:10.040 --> 3:01:15.560]  exercise 09 and it says troops from 14 countries are here training with us to
[3:01:15.560 --> 3:01:22.520]  put down a US rebellion open public foreign troops Bob that's right and they
[3:01:22.520 --> 3:01:27.640]  were here for what six weeks yeah they actually just kept it going they just
[3:01:27.640 --> 3:01:32.000]  scaled it down after six weeks I mean you can't make this type of stuff up BB in
[3:01:32.000 --> 3:01:38.040]  North Carolina BB you're on the air good day gentlemen I just wanted to have a
[3:01:38.040 --> 3:01:44.320]  question for you above Chapman this is Obama preparing for Civil War in US
[3:01:44.320 --> 3:01:49.960]  this article is even more disturbing than all the other stuff even with the
[3:01:49.960 --> 3:01:54.320]  global warming fraud and who wrote that who wrote that a guest that article is
[3:01:54.320 --> 3:01:58.920]  Obama preparing for Civil War in the US who wrote that yes sir it's Chuck Baldwin
[3:01:58.920 --> 3:02:04.560]  it's on your website but I don't I think the only thing more horrible or
[3:02:04.560 --> 3:02:09.920]  terrible would be a civil war FEMA admits they're preparing for civil war so
[3:02:09.920 --> 3:02:15.200]  yes right the only thing I could think worse than civil war would be general
[3:02:15.200 --> 3:02:21.560]  strategic thermonuclear warfare but what I want bioweapons are even worse right
[3:02:21.560 --> 3:02:28.160]  what I would like to ask you about Chapman was a Webster Tarpoli talks in
[3:02:28.160 --> 3:02:33.720]  his books I've got all his books from your eye and he talked about I've got
[3:02:33.720 --> 3:02:40.960]  Obama what could possibly usher in Civil War you know a general meltdown
[3:02:40.960 --> 3:02:48.040]  disintegration of the US banking at some point next year the thermodynamic
[3:02:48.040 --> 3:02:55.960]  breakdown in the economy bank runs that was a civil war and what Igor
[3:02:55.960 --> 3:03:02.800]  Panarin talks about the collapse of the US and June late June early July
[3:03:02.800 --> 3:03:08.080]  starting in 2010 I'll take your comments off the air thank you Bob Chapman
[3:03:08.080 --> 3:03:15.720]  comments well Panarin has said that and he is also looking for a collapse in the
[3:03:15.720 --> 3:03:19.800]  financial system the United States and course it'll spread throughout the world
[3:03:19.800 --> 3:03:25.560]  no one will be spared and that's my design to consolidate power exactly and
[3:03:25.560 --> 3:03:32.640]  I'm expecting that they will late in 2010 they will be a meeting of all
[3:03:32.640 --> 3:03:38.040]  countries representatives and I think they'll revalue devalue currencies I
[3:03:38.040 --> 3:03:44.240]  think that the US government will devalue no one knows for sure what the
[3:03:44.240 --> 3:03:52.440]  what the devaluation will be in numbers but I backed into it having done this
[3:03:52.440 --> 3:03:55.960]  sort of thing for many years and I think it's going to be one new one for three
[3:03:55.960 --> 3:04:01.320]  old dollars and I think that there will be a settlement between countries of
[3:04:01.320 --> 3:04:07.080]  debt and I think two-thirds of it will be written off how this will affect the
[3:04:07.080 --> 3:04:14.440]  average person with the devaluation in the United States I don't know logic
[3:04:14.440 --> 3:04:17.960]  would have us believe if you had a hundred thousand dollar loan and it was a
[3:04:17.960 --> 3:04:22.720]  devaluation by two-thirds then your loan would be payable back at thirty two
[3:04:22.720 --> 3:04:29.280]  thousand five hundred dollars but there's no logic in Washington and there's no
[3:04:29.280 --> 3:04:35.000]  logic among the Illuminati they do what they want to do so goodness knows what
[3:04:35.000 --> 3:04:43.160]  can happen but it does not look good it could last another six months into 2011
[3:04:43.160 --> 3:04:47.840]  for this devaluation but I think it's coming I've written about it just
[3:04:47.840 --> 3:04:52.000]  recently stay there stay there we're gonna talk about the international
[3:04:52.000 --> 3:04:55.200]  forecaster how folks get a copy when we come back and tell people what an
[3:04:55.200 --> 3:04:59.360]  evaluation will do to us economically and if that isn't enough a bunch of carbon
[3:04:59.360 --> 3:05:04.120]  taxes on top of it the goal bankrupt the analysis I want to tell you about the

[3:08:01.720 --> 3:08:07.480]  the Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[3:08:07.480 --> 3:08:15.480]  because there's a war on for your mind we had Ron Paul on with us at the very
[3:08:15.480 --> 3:08:23.520]  start of the first hour for a half hour and he said that he had to go at 1230
[3:08:23.520 --> 3:08:27.800]  1130 Central to go vote and he said he believed it would pass and that it was a
[3:08:27.800 --> 3:08:30.600]  strong bill
[3:08:31.480 --> 3:08:36.360]  sweeping bank reform bill clears house measure aimed at preventing another big
[3:08:36.360 --> 3:08:41.600]  financial crisis it poses more oversight and creates consumer protection agency
[3:08:41.600 --> 3:08:46.080]  and they hide in here that it has the provision to audit the Federal Reserve
[3:08:46.080 --> 3:08:52.080]  they certainly don't want to trumpet that Bob Chapman comment on that and then
[3:08:52.080 --> 3:08:58.040]  what dollar devaluation will look like so people understand how serious it is
[3:08:58.040 --> 3:09:05.240]  well it will inhibit the flow of business within a country or throughout the
[3:09:05.240 --> 3:09:12.880]  world less people will be employed real estate and another investments will
[3:09:12.880 --> 3:09:16.160]  probably like they did during the depression get out anywhere between
[3:09:16.160 --> 3:09:22.560]  60 and 95% and wouldn't recover until maybe we had another war maybe they
[3:09:22.560 --> 3:09:28.720]  never recover the valuation for America is going to be a staggering blow
[3:09:28.720 --> 3:09:33.480]  because we live better than anybody else in the world and so that we get a long
[3:09:33.480 --> 3:09:38.880]  way to go to get to get to go down I mean you go to a country say Mexico they've
[3:09:38.880 --> 3:09:42.840]  had a lot of poverty real poverty for many years so people have got used to
[3:09:42.840 --> 3:09:49.000]  living that way and all the houses of Mexico with minor exception are paid
[3:09:49.000 --> 3:09:54.200]  for with cash so they don't have the downside that Americans do it's true in
[3:09:54.200 --> 3:09:59.200]  many other countries as well so a devaluation will be devastating how do
[3:09:59.200 --> 3:10:03.240]  you protect yourself there's only one way I know and that's gold and silver
[3:10:03.240 --> 3:10:08.240]  related assets period there is no other way and if you're not doing it you're
[3:10:08.240 --> 3:10:10.800]  fools
[3:10:11.680 --> 3:10:21.040]  continue Bob I think that the the passage in the house and I and we will pass the
[3:10:21.040 --> 3:10:26.920]  Senate of this bill which is actually the bill is monstrous except for the part
[3:10:26.920 --> 3:10:32.480]  about the the auditing and investigation of the Fed and I'm going to write about
[3:10:32.480 --> 3:10:39.640]  that for tomorrow's issue right after we get off the program here and but anyway
[3:10:39.640 --> 3:10:46.240]  it's a seminal event that this legislation included the auditing of the
[3:10:46.240 --> 3:10:52.160]  Fed and the reason why I think it's a major turning point we get a pass to the
[3:10:52.160 --> 3:11:00.680]  Senate becomes law and immediately get the GAO in there and find out who the
[3:11:00.680 --> 3:11:05.080]  money's going to why is it going to him how are they using it what are they
[3:11:05.080 --> 3:11:12.320]  paying for what the collateral how many foreign central banks foreign entities
[3:11:12.320 --> 3:11:16.280]  of all kinds are receiving funds which are created out of thin air by the
[3:11:16.280 --> 3:11:22.280]  Treasury by the Federal Reserve what are the assets of the Federal Reserve really
[3:11:22.280 --> 3:11:28.280]  and they're just a myriad of things and we can do that within six months and by
[3:11:28.280 --> 3:11:31.760]  the time the next election comes around hopefully we can throw half the
[3:11:31.760 --> 3:11:36.440]  incumbents out of office it doesn't matter what party they're in we got to get
[3:11:36.440 --> 3:11:41.440]  them out they're on the take we're getting paid how do they get paid campaign
[3:11:41.440 --> 3:11:50.560]  contributions by who Wall Street banking insurance transnational conglomerates
[3:11:50.560 --> 3:11:56.920]  the pharmaceutical companies etc these are the big guns in there and the people
[3:11:56.920 --> 3:12:01.800]  who are getting paid off by them get them out of there we might have a chance
[3:12:01.800 --> 3:12:08.920]  to make this happen it's our only chance legally through the system
[3:12:08.920 --> 3:12:15.440]  absolutely you know I look at the overall bill and thank God Ron Paul got
[3:12:15.440 --> 3:12:21.240]  that one good part in there but Obama's approving of it so you know it's bad it
[3:12:21.240 --> 3:12:25.360]  says Obama administration expected expressed its approval of the House
[3:12:25.360 --> 3:12:33.280]  action so again I wish I would have had more time or I would have gotten to this
[3:12:33.280 --> 3:12:40.560]  earlier with Ron Paul to fully flesh it out because he was talking about how
[3:12:40.560 --> 3:12:44.760]  well they tried to strip the good provisions out in committee but he got
[3:12:44.760 --> 3:12:50.480]  an amendment in to keep the strong audit the Fed bill part in so I should have
[3:12:50.480 --> 3:12:55.720]  asked Ron Paul how he was even going to vote on this because I because he'll
[3:12:55.720 --> 3:12:59.560]  he'll vote against something that has something good in it if it has something
[3:12:59.560 --> 3:13:03.880]  bad in it but it did pass I mean that's quite a mystery I'll have to find out
[3:13:03.880 --> 3:13:08.200]  here in the next few days I wonder what the quickest way to find out is Bob get
[3:13:08.200 --> 3:13:16.640]  on the phone and call them that's a good idea guys that's the best way and just
[3:13:16.640 --> 3:13:22.200]  say Ron you know what's a good parts what's a bad parts obviously you voted
[3:13:22.200 --> 3:13:29.040]  for it you know it's just like the concept your enemies enemy is your
[3:13:29.040 --> 3:13:34.000]  friend or at least for the time being and you got to look at it that way
[3:13:34.000 --> 3:13:39.600]  because we're desperate people doing desperate things we're entrapped by an
[3:13:39.600 --> 3:13:45.200]  evil cabal and we got to do anything we can to get out of it first within the
[3:13:45.200 --> 3:13:50.480]  law later if we can't do it that way it'll be outside the law and that's just
[3:13:50.480 --> 3:13:54.520]  the way things are okay I do have it from CNN money
[3:13:54.520 --> 3:13:58.880]  Federal Reserve the bill would allow Congress so I was correct to order the
[3:13:58.880 --> 3:14:03.340]  government accountability office to audit the Fed activities so now the audit
[3:14:03.340 --> 3:14:08.360]  goes forward if the Senate passes this and they're set to pass it because they
[3:14:08.360 --> 3:14:17.440]  want the overall package so to audit the Fed does go forward Bob Chapman well
[3:14:17.440 --> 3:14:25.600]  again it's a turning point in our history a big one and the doggedness and the
[3:14:25.600 --> 3:14:31.840]  the will of Ron Paul over the last 20 years have made this happen if you'd
[3:14:31.840 --> 3:14:36.400]  ask somebody two years ago whether this is possible they say you you're crazy
[3:14:36.400 --> 3:14:42.080]  and we are let me spend on that Bob what is monstrous to you about the bill
[3:14:42.080 --> 3:14:46.560]  it's obviously hundreds of pages long the bailouts of AIG Bear Stearns would
[3:14:46.560 --> 3:14:51.720]  not be possible made illegal under this bill represented Barney Frank chairman
[3:14:51.720 --> 3:14:55.880]  of the House Financial Committee said Wednesday as debate started on the bill
[3:14:55.880 --> 3:15:00.960]  which again passed today on Friday if a company fails it will be put to death
[3:15:00.960 --> 3:15:05.160]  but now is the globalist of consolidated power they want to be able to do
[3:15:05.160 --> 3:15:12.240]  that well we don't know I don't know what the final bill looks like you know
[3:15:12.240 --> 3:15:18.200]  you neither do you you're well you guys pull up the House vote on the financial
[3:15:18.200 --> 3:15:24.360]  overhaul bill and and see what Paul's vote is because he said again he was
[3:15:24.360 --> 3:15:27.360]  talking fast there at the end and I wish I would have gotten to it earlier he
[3:15:27.360 --> 3:15:31.040]  said well we probably just play the clip again so we can have it actually from
[3:15:31.040 --> 3:15:35.360]  him but he said yeah I voted against it in committee because it was bad but I
[3:15:35.360 --> 3:15:40.320]  got the amendment through to make it good and he said so we will get the bill
[3:15:40.320 --> 3:15:43.560]  to audit the Fed but then I wonder because if he disagrees with any part
[3:15:43.560 --> 3:15:47.400]  of legislation he won't go for it just because his writer of auditing the Fed
[3:15:47.400 --> 3:15:52.560]  is now in there I wonder if he voted for this but regardless audit of the Fed
[3:15:52.560 --> 3:15:57.880]  literally has gotten to third base right now and we're going to get a home run on
[3:15:57.880 --> 3:16:02.640]  it and we got to start really lurid leaning now that it's been passed all
[3:16:02.640 --> 3:16:08.560]  of these cosponses you got to jump all over them and say we want the GAO to work
[3:16:08.560 --> 3:16:14.200]  as fast as possible these are the things we need to know and those things are how
[3:16:14.200 --> 3:16:18.920]  is the money spent how much was created what has the Fed been doing in secret
[3:16:18.920 --> 3:16:23.160]  let's look at all their emails particularly the ones to other banks
[3:16:23.160 --> 3:16:28.040]  into Wall Street who's been getting inside information if you leave me they
[3:16:28.040 --> 3:16:32.600]  get it absolutely insider trading let's play a short clip of Ron Paul and get
[3:16:32.600 --> 3:16:36.360]  your take on what he said because this Washington stuff is very complex and
[3:16:36.360 --> 3:16:39.920]  though I spend all my time researching and we try to stay on top of the
[3:16:39.920 --> 3:16:44.240]  subtleties of the parliamentary procedure here it is auditing the Fed give us a
[3:16:44.240 --> 3:16:50.040]  report on that okay I think most know that last week it was put into a bank
[3:16:50.040 --> 3:16:54.520]  regular regulation bill which is a monster of a bill when it came out of
[3:16:54.520 --> 3:16:57.360]  the committee I voted against the bill because I don't vote for a few good
[3:16:57.360 --> 3:17:03.160]  things when there's a lot of bad things in it but my amendment won by 42 to 26
[3:17:03.160 --> 3:17:07.280]  which was a major victory it's on the high floor at this moment it will be
[3:17:07.280 --> 3:17:12.280]  voted on at the end of the day and the auditing provision was in both the
[3:17:12.280 --> 3:17:15.360]  Republican version and the Democratic version the Republic the Democratic
[3:17:15.360 --> 3:17:19.200]  version will pass and the auditing provision will be in there the real
[3:17:19.200 --> 3:17:23.800]  work needs to be done in the Senate so if anybody knows whether you know that
[3:17:23.800 --> 3:17:27.880]  where their senator stands try to urge the senators to get on that same bill
[3:17:27.880 --> 3:17:33.920]  I think it's 604 and there's 30 in over there there's been several senators that
[3:17:33.920 --> 3:17:41.840]  have put a hold on on Bernanke's reappointment unless unless they have a
[3:17:41.840 --> 3:17:47.760]  vote on 12 or 7 the auditing bill in the Senate so sir this is a massive
[3:17:47.760 --> 3:17:52.080]  victory I mean today it looks like they're gonna probably pass it in the
[3:17:52.080 --> 3:17:55.640]  house it'll go to the Senate and then the fights in the Senate this is
[3:17:55.640 --> 3:18:01.880]  incredible news yeah yeah it's big if we have no idea you know exactly what
[3:18:01.880 --> 3:18:04.880]  will happen there'll be a lot more resistance in the Senate and the Fed
[3:18:04.880 --> 3:18:09.360]  still has time to do all that they do but nevertheless I think you're correct
[3:18:09.360 --> 3:18:13.520]  is describing as a major victory for the people you know though I mean the
[3:18:13.520 --> 3:18:18.560]  grassroots got this done I didn't twist arms I have no cloud up here in that
[3:18:18.560 --> 3:18:24.720]  sense okay Bob I have the complete answer now I had Ron Paul on earlier but
[3:18:24.720 --> 3:18:28.920]  didn't ask him this question though that sounded like he was saying he couldn't
[3:18:28.920 --> 3:18:35.240]  vote for his own bill because overall the banking package was bad here is the
[3:18:35.240 --> 3:18:41.400]  Wall Street Journal just out Q&A Ron Paul explains why he can't vote for his
[3:18:41.400 --> 3:18:46.600]  own audit the Fed bill and it says author of the amendment to allow the
[3:18:46.600 --> 3:18:50.360]  government accountability audit monetary policy decisions made by the Federal
[3:18:50.360 --> 3:18:54.560]  Reserve Mr. Paul said he is proud of the amendment but would vote for the
[3:18:54.560 --> 3:18:58.840]  broader bill but wouldn't vote for the broader bill to overhaul financial
[3:18:58.840 --> 3:19:02.840]  market rules because as he objects to a number of his provisions he spoke Friday
[3:19:02.840 --> 3:19:08.960]  the Wall Street Journal but he so so he is for his amendment to audit the Fed
[3:19:08.960 --> 3:19:13.600]  that's the only good thing in here you got a little bit of punch in the third
[3:19:13.600 --> 3:19:22.080]  bowl here I'm sorry he's that horrible analogy but so he did vote against the
[3:19:22.080 --> 3:19:27.280]  bill but it still passed so the audit the Fed bill goes ahead now to the US
[3:19:27.280 --> 3:19:32.160]  Senate we need to make sure that provision stays in the US Senate version
[3:19:32.160 --> 3:19:37.480]  correct Bob Chapman right we got to get after the Senate is just like Ron said
[3:19:37.480 --> 3:19:42.800]  they get after them each and every one of them not just your own senator you
[3:19:42.800 --> 3:19:47.760]  got a bomb bottom you got to make them think that there's 80 percent of the
[3:19:47.760 --> 3:19:54.640]  population that votes is for passing 604 irrespective of what else is in it and
[3:19:54.640 --> 3:20:02.280]  I think what Ron did if he voted against the bill was he voted voted his
[3:20:02.280 --> 3:20:05.360]  conscience this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the a cola blue

[3:21:17.400 --> 3:21:22.440]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[3:21:22.440 --> 3:21:27.840]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention full
[3:21:27.840 --> 3:21:32.120]  of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal off-short
[3:21:32.120 --> 3:21:36.840]  cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing

[3:21:40.880 --> 3:21:44.800]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[3:21:44.800 --> 3:21:50.360]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[3:22:14.400 --> 3:22:17.960]  the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy that
[3:22:17.960 --> 3:22:21.720]  social security would be there for you that's not what's happening you might
[3:22:21.720 --> 3:22:26.240]  even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation or that
[3:22:26.240 --> 3:22:30.160]  the dollar wouldn't lose value or that your retirement would be secure if all
[3:22:30.160 --> 3:22:34.200]  looks rosy to you then now is not the time to buy gold for the realists there
[3:22:34.200 --> 3:22:39.040]  have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold since 2001 the US
[3:22:39.040 --> 3:22:44.840]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300% right now savvy investors
[3:22:44.840 --> 3:22:49.120]  are adding gold to their portfolios you should too find out what they know call
[3:22:49.120 --> 3:22:55.080]  us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well free 800 686 2237
[3:22:55.080 --> 3:23:04.920]  that's 800 686 2237 this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[3:23:04.920 --> 3:23:09.360]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[3:23:09.360 --> 3:23:13.400]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[3:23:13.400 --> 3:23:17.320]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[3:23:17.320 --> 3:23:21.320]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[3:23:21.320 --> 3:23:25.880]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[3:23:25.880 --> 3:23:29.880]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[3:23:29.880 --> 3:23:33.680]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[3:23:33.680 --> 3:23:37.320]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[3:23:37.320 --> 3:23:41.680]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[3:23:41.680 --> 3:23:44.840]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[3:23:44.840 --> 3:23:48.520]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[3:23:48.520 --> 3:23:54.040]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[3:23:54.040 --> 3:23:58.840]  remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call
[3:23:58.840 --> 3:24:03.800]  1-877-327-0365
[3:24:05.080 --> 3:24:09.880]  we just talked to Rachel Mills press secretary for Ron Paul he did vote against
[3:24:09.880 --> 3:24:13.960]  the overall banking bill but he shepherded the audit the Fed bill the
[3:24:13.960 --> 3:24:18.080]  amendment through the house banking committee into the bill he's happy at
[3:24:18.080 --> 3:24:21.840]  the past he's not happy the other provisions are in there but it now goes
[3:24:21.840 --> 3:24:25.560]  to the Senate we've got to make sure that doesn't get stripped out I wanted to
[3:24:25.560 --> 3:24:29.360]  take a few final calls for Bob Chapman then I'm gonna run down all the latest
[3:24:29.360 --> 3:24:34.800]  climate gate a bunch of other financial news that I haven't gotten to yet but
[3:24:34.800 --> 3:24:39.640]  first let's go to Greg in Hawaii who's been patiently holding Greg you're on

[3:25:03.200 --> 3:25:08.760]  works for big pharma is one question and another question is what size of shirt
[3:25:08.760 --> 3:25:13.640]  you wear I want to send you a shirt I made for Chris okay well number one my
[3:25:13.640 --> 3:25:18.280]  my wife when she was my girlfriend didn't really entirely believe everything I
[3:25:18.280 --> 3:25:22.680]  was talking about and I said that's great honey I like you and like the way
[3:25:22.680 --> 3:25:27.200]  you look and then everything else and I like your personality you don't have to
[3:25:27.200 --> 3:25:31.720]  believe what I believe and then after a year or two of being around me she was
[3:25:31.720 --> 3:25:34.640]  like my god this stuff's all real she'd see me there reading the papers the
[3:25:34.640 --> 3:25:39.160]  documents and then we got married and she knows as much as I do about this and
[3:25:39.160 --> 3:25:43.400]  is more freaked out than I am and and can't believe the public isn't waking up
[3:25:43.400 --> 3:25:48.240]  so I wouldn't hard-seller you could bring her you know the CBS news article
[3:25:48.240 --> 3:25:52.440]  where they put live polio virus in the polio vaccine killing a bunch of people
[3:25:52.440 --> 3:25:55.800]  you can bring her the Tuskegee experiment information you can bring her
[3:25:55.800 --> 3:25:59.920]  project shad her own government nerve gas our troops to death that did test on

[3:26:29.440 --> 3:26:33.800]  the public on serotonin re uptake inhibitors is great you know you you
[3:26:33.800 --> 3:26:37.840]  think all this is wonderful hey here's articles right here here's the insert for
[3:26:37.840 --> 3:26:41.680]  Prozac admitting it can make you commit suicide oh here's articles where they
[3:26:41.680 --> 3:26:47.040]  suppressed that in their trials in 1981 I mean instead of arguing whether just
[3:26:47.040 --> 3:26:51.720]  give her a pile of documents Bob Chapman there's nothing but no no other way to
[3:26:51.720 --> 3:26:57.640]  do it and of course as Alex is citing as the international forecaster and over
[3:26:57.640 --> 3:27:03.840]  a period of time as long as she's willing to listen it'll all open up thank
[3:27:03.840 --> 3:27:07.680]  you very much gentlemen what about the chemtrails because a month ago I saw a
[3:27:07.680 --> 3:27:12.640]  great plane flying about 4,000 feet leasing a chemtrail over key hey well
[3:27:12.640 --> 3:27:15.720]  the White House science are is now admitted there's been a long-term
[3:27:15.720 --> 3:27:21.720]  secret weather modification project they call geoengineering or terraforming
[3:27:21.720 --> 3:27:26.080]  going on and yes there is a lot of atmospheric manipulation I wear a large
[3:27:26.080 --> 3:27:29.280]  okay I went from an extra large to a large but if I don't get back on my
[3:27:29.280 --> 3:27:33.160]  diet I'll go back to an extra large but I wear a large t-shirt thank you very
[3:27:33.160 --> 3:27:37.560]  much sir I appreciate the call another call for Bob Chapman here William in
[3:27:37.560 --> 3:27:41.800]  Tennessee you're on the air go ahead William greetings and salutations from
[3:27:41.800 --> 3:27:46.720]  the FEMA controlled state of Tennessee yes how are you doing today yes you for
[3:27:46.720 --> 3:27:50.060]  those that don't know you have official army checkpoints in Tennessee the
[3:27:50.060 --> 3:27:54.080]  governor says don't do it but they just continue them that's everywhere it's
[3:27:54.080 --> 3:27:58.000]  really intimidating to try to go anywhere public I just had a really quick
[3:27:58.000 --> 3:28:03.760]  question for you which of your documentaries best describes eugenics
[3:28:03.760 --> 3:28:14.040]  project and it's overreaching overarching end result in game end game
[3:28:14.040 --> 3:28:20.960]  blueprint for global enslavement this film right here in game why they would
[3:28:20.960 --> 3:28:24.960]  want us to all perish I mean that they need slaves right no they don't want
[3:28:24.960 --> 3:28:28.200]  us to all perish they want on average different documents say different
[3:28:28.200 --> 3:28:33.960]  numbers 250 to 350 million people Bob Chapman explain to our friend this is a
[3:28:33.960 --> 3:28:39.000]  parasitic banking system that creates fiat money to buy the world they don't
[3:28:39.000 --> 3:28:43.960]  need us they don't want us explain that Bob well to take them one step
[3:28:43.960 --> 3:28:49.440]  further then they don't need as many people and they're interested in the
[3:28:49.440 --> 3:28:54.120]  longevity of the planet there also is Alex said earlier if you were listening
[3:28:54.120 --> 3:29:01.120]  they have ways of extending life now 150 to 200 years and it'll grow in time
[3:29:01.120 --> 3:29:05.880]  and they don't want to give that to everybody they just want these slaves
[3:29:05.880 --> 3:29:13.800]  to be able to evolve for the time that they naturally are living today which
[3:29:13.800 --> 3:29:19.360]  would be in the 80s and then if people learn about what they're doing well
[3:29:19.360 --> 3:29:25.360]  they'll naturally die or be put to death and so that's the you might call it the
[3:29:25.360 --> 3:29:29.600]  the world that they want to create for us Bob Chapman fire out the toll free
[3:29:29.600 --> 3:29:34.560]  number of folks want a complimentary copy of the international forecaster that

[3:30:06.240 --> 3:30:10.240]  you about the silver lungs generator now you can produce pure and endless
[3:30:10.240 --> 3:30:14.480]  colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by
[3:30:14.480 --> 3:30:18.760]  breathing the solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the first line
[3:30:18.760 --> 3:30:22.760]  of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator
[3:30:22.760 --> 3:30:27.600]  infuses the respiratory system with yourself produced nano silver solutions
[3:30:27.600 --> 3:30:32.520]  and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream
[3:30:32.520 --> 3:30:37.320]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products you
[3:30:37.320 --> 3:30:41.600]  can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs
[3:30:41.600 --> 3:30:45.720]  generator very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided
[3:30:45.720 --> 3:30:52.600]  making production fast and simple go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more
[3:30:52.600 --> 3:31:00.320]  about the breakthrough technology of the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[3:31:00.320 --> 3:31:07.560]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[3:31:07.560 --> 3:31:12.160]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[3:31:12.160 --> 3:31:16.000]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home
[3:31:16.000 --> 3:31:21.080]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[3:31:21.080 --> 3:31:26.400]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[3:31:26.400 --> 3:31:30.960]  attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[3:31:30.960 --> 3:31:35.640]  offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[3:31:35.640 --> 3:31:39.680]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're
[3:31:39.680 --> 3:31:43.360]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who to make the check out to
[3:31:43.360 --> 3:31:48.440]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen
[3:31:48.440 --> 3:31:54.520]  a fall of the Republic yet your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info

[3:33:01.400 --> 3:33:30.000]  see
[3:33:30.000 --> 3:33:45.400]  Okay, my friends, I'm going to take some of your phone calls, run over some of the news.
[3:33:45.400 --> 3:33:53.080]  We haven't covered recap some of the most important top stories.
[3:33:53.080 --> 3:33:57.480]  And I know this information is hard to believe that we cover here.
[3:33:57.480 --> 3:34:00.520]  I got a Texas Monthly reporter out there, good old Nate.
[3:34:00.520 --> 3:34:04.960]  He wrote a great story about Tulia, Texas, and the police and informants planting drugs
[3:34:04.960 --> 3:34:07.320]  on people to put them in prison.
[3:34:07.320 --> 3:34:12.240]  But he heard Bob Chapman talk about the elite believing they can extend their lifespans.
[3:34:12.240 --> 3:34:16.600]  And he said, do you ever stop people when they're saying something that's outlandish?
[3:34:16.600 --> 3:34:19.520]  That's not outlandish.
[3:34:19.520 --> 3:34:23.320]  That's in my film, in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[3:34:23.320 --> 3:34:29.480]  Ray Kurzweil, Bill Joy, countless others, they believe this is happening.
[3:34:29.480 --> 3:34:34.080]  They believe that they need to get rid of the general population, reduce the world's
[3:34:34.080 --> 3:34:37.840]  numbers so that the select few can have access to this.
[3:34:37.840 --> 3:34:41.520]  Now, whether it's real or whether they're going to be able to develop it, that remains
[3:34:41.520 --> 3:34:43.680]  to be seen.
[3:34:43.680 --> 3:34:48.160]  But they've already doubled the lifespans of rats by special diets.
[3:34:48.160 --> 3:34:51.640]  They've doubled the lifespans of different worms with special diets.
[3:34:51.640 --> 3:34:53.880]  And that's only one area.
[3:34:53.880 --> 3:34:56.120]  I don't know if that's true or not.
[3:34:56.120 --> 3:34:57.120]  I don't know if that's real.
[3:34:57.120 --> 3:35:01.800]  I mean, I know the studies are real, but I don't know if they can do this with humans.
[3:35:01.800 --> 3:35:04.600]  Studies show it's similar effects with humans.
[3:35:04.600 --> 3:35:06.080]  A lot of it's genetic.
[3:35:06.080 --> 3:35:09.800]  They have all these new genetic treatments, nanotech.
[3:35:09.800 --> 3:35:19.840]  But when I sit here and talk about China calling for a global one-child policy, I have the
[3:35:19.840 --> 3:35:24.280]  China Daily, the big official government newspaper here.
[3:35:24.280 --> 3:35:27.280]  Population control called key.
[3:35:27.280 --> 3:35:30.240]  And the government official, the member of the Chinese government delegation, called
[3:35:30.240 --> 3:35:34.080]  for a global one-child policy.
[3:35:34.080 --> 3:35:35.080]  Here's another one.
[3:35:35.080 --> 3:35:40.080]  The real inconvenient truth, the national post of Canada.
[3:35:40.080 --> 3:35:46.360]  I mean, just Google one-child policy and click it.
[3:35:46.360 --> 3:35:49.400]  And yesterday I did it and several hundred new articles came up.
[3:35:49.400 --> 3:35:52.680]  Not Google web, Google news, only the last seven days.
[3:35:52.680 --> 3:35:55.280]  Like, let's do it right now for the news reporter.
[3:35:55.280 --> 3:36:01.560]  Let's go to Google right now and let's together because this is real.
[3:36:01.560 --> 3:36:05.800]  This is being proposed right now in Copenhagen.
[3:36:05.800 --> 3:36:10.520]  Let's go to the search engine and type in one-child policy.
[3:36:10.520 --> 3:36:12.880]  One-child policy.
[3:36:12.880 --> 3:36:16.960]  There it is on TV screen for prisonplanet.tv viewers.
[3:36:16.960 --> 3:36:23.640]  Now let's click a news search and we put it on the screen over here so I can see it.
[3:36:23.640 --> 3:36:25.080]  Thank you.
[3:36:25.080 --> 3:36:27.040]  I can try to read it from over there.
[3:36:27.040 --> 3:36:31.680]  How many articles does it say in the last seven days?
[3:36:31.680 --> 3:36:34.520]  It'll be at the bottom of the top block.
[3:36:34.520 --> 3:36:41.640]  It says how many other news, see the green link right there on the first block.
[3:36:41.640 --> 3:36:44.840]  How many other news stories does that say?
[3:36:44.840 --> 3:36:45.840]  All 35.
[3:36:45.840 --> 3:36:49.160]  And if you count up the other blocks, it was several hundred yesterday.
[3:36:49.160 --> 3:36:51.320]  But I mean, just read the top link right there.
[3:36:51.320 --> 3:36:52.520]  Read the top link.
[3:36:52.520 --> 3:36:56.760]  Beijing tells world to fight climate change through one-child policy.
[3:36:56.760 --> 3:36:58.960]  And the United Nations has proposed this.
[3:36:58.960 --> 3:37:03.520]  The White House scientists are John P. Holdren has proposed this and drugging your water
[3:37:03.520 --> 3:37:11.440]  supply to sterilize you and creating a global earth religion to enforce it.
[3:37:11.440 --> 3:37:12.440]  Okay?
[3:37:12.440 --> 3:37:17.640]  Now, let me read to you from the national post.
[3:37:17.640 --> 3:37:24.040]  The real inconvenient truth, the whole world needs to adopt China's one-child policy.
[3:37:24.040 --> 3:37:29.160]  A planetary law such as China's one-child policy is the only way to reverse the global
[3:37:29.160 --> 3:37:30.760]  birthrate currently.
[3:37:30.760 --> 3:37:31.760]  Okay?
[3:37:31.760 --> 3:37:35.200]  Now, what did Dr. Eric Pionka at UT called for?
[3:37:35.200 --> 3:37:41.920]  He said a Chinese global police state modeled after the Chinese that with forced abortion
[3:37:41.920 --> 3:37:42.920]  all of it.
[3:37:42.920 --> 3:37:46.000]  This is what is in the U.N. documents.
[3:37:46.000 --> 3:37:50.920]  This is what is being set up right now.
[3:37:50.920 --> 3:38:00.680]  Now, what else is in the documents?
[3:38:00.680 --> 3:38:05.240]  What else is going on with all of this?
[3:38:05.240 --> 3:38:10.680]  We have the Copenhagen Climate Summit in Dissirat or Danish text leak.
[3:38:10.680 --> 3:38:16.040]  And this is from the London Guardian and you click the first link and you can read the
[3:38:16.040 --> 3:38:20.560]  secret treaty on addendum to the public treaty that they plan to try to pass next week.
[3:38:20.560 --> 3:38:21.560]  This is confirmed.
[3:38:21.560 --> 3:38:23.680]  And it says the U.N. will have no power.
[3:38:23.680 --> 3:38:30.280]  The IMF and World Bank will run it and levy global taxes on everyone on the planet.
[3:38:30.280 --> 3:38:37.760]  And Maury Strong, the head of the U.N. environment initiative states, we must destroy the United
[3:38:37.760 --> 3:38:45.320]  States and global industrial capacity to force population reduction.
[3:38:45.320 --> 3:38:57.480]  Now, let me read to you what people, again, I spent 30 minutes or so this morning just
[3:38:57.480 --> 3:39:01.080]  reading the comments in the national post article.
[3:39:01.080 --> 3:39:02.080]  And I had to stop.
[3:39:02.080 --> 3:39:07.080]  There were hundreds, but in 30 minutes of reading, speed reading, I did not find one
[3:39:07.080 --> 3:39:12.240]  comment agreeing with the author of this article.
[3:39:12.240 --> 3:39:14.240]  But they don't care.
[3:39:14.240 --> 3:39:17.200]  They're still going to try to implement it.
[3:39:17.200 --> 3:39:22.160]  Let me read to you some of the comments that I printed off from this.
[3:39:22.160 --> 3:39:30.000]  Wow, this has been tried before Stalin was the master of the trick starved the people
[3:39:30.000 --> 3:39:33.200]  and they will do whatever we want.
[3:39:33.200 --> 3:39:34.920]  That's from J Bird.
[3:39:34.920 --> 3:39:44.680]  This is a tough measure to sell because we've got used to levels of consumption that is
[3:39:44.680 --> 3:39:47.280]  not going to be easy to move away from.
[3:39:47.280 --> 3:39:52.160]  Government can't extort, influence and educate, but it's going to take change from consumers,
[3:39:52.160 --> 3:39:55.400]  retailers and producers.
[3:39:55.400 --> 3:40:00.160]  Poor in instance means I have a good quality of life, but means I must constantly work
[3:40:00.160 --> 3:40:04.880]  to pay bills and I have little chance of changing my lifestyle considerably without it costing
[3:40:04.880 --> 3:40:05.880]  me.
[3:40:05.880 --> 3:40:11.840]  I can afford most people in developed countries live like this.
[3:40:11.840 --> 3:40:16.200]  Here's another comment.
[3:40:16.200 --> 3:40:19.720]  You know, what happened this morning is when I was reading this, there were hundreds of
[3:40:19.720 --> 3:40:22.720]  comments and now that they printed it when I got to the office, and there's actually
[3:40:22.720 --> 3:40:24.280]  a few here supporting it now.
[3:40:24.280 --> 3:40:27.680]  Oh, because it's saying this comments been removed by moderator.
[3:40:27.680 --> 3:40:30.960]  See what happened is I was at my, here's a little conspiracy right here.
[3:40:30.960 --> 3:40:33.000]  I was at my house reading comment after comment.
[3:40:33.000 --> 3:40:37.880]  Everyone's saying you're a Nazi, you want Malthusian eugenics and now they're just removing
[3:40:37.880 --> 3:40:40.200]  it all because we printed this once I got to the office.
[3:40:40.200 --> 3:40:41.520]  Isn't that amazing?
[3:40:41.520 --> 3:40:52.040]  I said print those off so I can read them and now they're removed by the moderator.
[3:40:52.040 --> 3:40:56.400]  Says does the mobile organ bank come with a laugh track because that's what they have
[3:40:56.400 --> 3:40:57.400]  in China.
[3:40:57.400 --> 3:40:59.560]  They have mobile execution vans.
[3:40:59.560 --> 3:41:01.440]  Oh, the reporter won't believe that.
[3:41:01.440 --> 3:41:05.560]  Google mobile execution vans in China will show him those.
[3:41:05.560 --> 3:41:08.360]  Does the mobile organ bank come with a track, a laugh track?
[3:41:08.360 --> 3:41:09.600]  I'll check back later.
[3:41:09.600 --> 3:41:14.080]  I'm just on my way to pick up a few stakes and a half gallon of milk for the supper
[3:41:14.080 --> 3:41:16.080]  and maybe a block of nice cheddar cheese.
[3:41:16.080 --> 3:41:19.760]  This article made me hungry and see that's because it's all over the news now that we
[3:41:19.760 --> 3:41:21.720]  shouldn't be able to eat meat and cheese.
[3:41:21.720 --> 3:41:29.920]  It has a big carbon footprint because the flatulence of cows is going to kill the universe.
[3:41:29.920 --> 3:41:33.520]  I'm a vegetarian.
[3:41:33.520 --> 3:41:39.200]  These bloody lunatic AGWs are making me think about taking up meat eating at the 20 years
[3:41:39.200 --> 3:41:44.160]  of abstinence.
[3:41:44.160 --> 3:41:46.480]  And again, more moderator removed.
[3:41:46.480 --> 3:41:50.800]  The comments I was reading have been removed.
[3:41:50.800 --> 3:41:53.680]  Lies lies and man made climate change.
[3:41:53.680 --> 3:41:57.520]  The status left would steal our liberties and hysterically with his nonsense.
[3:41:57.520 --> 3:41:59.400]  How can anyone believe them anymore?
[3:41:59.400 --> 3:42:04.120]  Their lives would not make good science fiction.
[3:42:04.120 --> 3:42:05.840]  Would even make good science fiction.
[3:42:05.840 --> 3:42:08.680]  Kill all our pets because they eat, breathe and poop.
[3:42:08.680 --> 3:42:11.120]  Actually, they're calling for taxes on all dogs.
[3:42:11.120 --> 3:42:13.000]  Did you find the mobile execution vans?
[3:42:13.000 --> 3:42:17.440]  So I want to show him times of London Associated Press up.
[3:42:17.440 --> 3:42:18.440]  That's USA Today.
[3:42:18.440 --> 3:42:28.240]  China makes ultimate punishment mobile continuing staples are over this.
[3:42:28.240 --> 3:42:29.800]  Let me pull it off.
[3:42:29.800 --> 3:42:31.880]  Others say we should look at population control.
[3:42:31.880 --> 3:42:34.000]  A few suggest wars of genocide.
[3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:37.800]  Many others would prefer to pretend that numbers do not mean anything and we should just carry
[3:42:37.800 --> 3:42:39.600]  on.
[3:42:39.600 --> 3:42:42.320]  Tim Lang isn't the first to suggest we should tighten our belts.
[3:42:42.320 --> 3:42:46.120]  My priority this year is to secure some land so I can grow my own veggies.
[3:42:46.120 --> 3:42:48.560]  They're trying to restrict that under these laws.
[3:42:48.560 --> 3:42:49.560]  Already have seed.
[3:42:49.560 --> 3:42:51.840]  So there's somebody who likes it.
[3:42:51.840 --> 3:42:57.680]  And Henry Kissinger calls for wars, stage wars and famine and State Department memorandum
[3:42:57.680 --> 3:42:58.680]  200.
[3:42:58.680 --> 3:43:04.880]  And you can go through these comments when I read this morning, there wasn't one comment
[3:43:04.880 --> 3:43:05.880]  in support.
[3:43:05.880 --> 3:43:12.160]  Now there are a few here and moderators removed the people as fast as they can.
[3:43:12.160 --> 3:43:18.360]  This is unbelievable Chinese style, one child policy.
[3:43:18.360 --> 3:43:26.300]  So we have gone from saying the Chinese are bad with forced abortion and phantasy and imprisoning
[3:43:26.300 --> 3:43:30.880]  people that have more than one child to, oh, yes, we've got to have it in China that owns
[3:43:30.880 --> 3:43:32.560]  the majority of our debt.
[3:43:32.560 --> 3:43:39.040]  They're saying that we have to have one child policies in the West.
[3:43:39.040 --> 3:43:48.040]  And of course, inside of the Copenhagen global government treaty, they say that the third
[3:43:48.040 --> 3:43:52.760]  world has to make right at double the cuts the West does when they're right at subsistence
[3:43:52.760 --> 3:43:59.320]  level because the evil humans are exhaling carbon dioxide 15 plus million people starved
[3:43:59.320 --> 3:44:04.160]  to death and additional 10 million starved to death in 2008 because of ethanol, one third
[3:44:04.160 --> 3:44:13.440]  of US, Brazilian and other food production being taken out to grow corn and other things
[3:44:13.440 --> 3:44:20.800]  that are turned into ethanol for cars, just absolute bull.
[3:44:20.800 --> 3:44:26.440]  This is George Soros key prison planet dot com article climate colonialism Soros wants
[3:44:26.440 --> 3:44:29.200]  poor nations to take on green debt.
[3:44:29.200 --> 3:44:34.120]  That's what's in the new treaty suggests more crippling IMF loans.
[3:44:34.120 --> 3:44:38.320]  The third world in the name of saving the planet billionaire George Soros has suggested
[3:44:38.320 --> 3:44:43.160]  the poor nations be persuaded to take on what he describes as green loans in the name of
[3:44:43.160 --> 3:44:47.400]  combating climate change, a policy that would land the already crippled poor third world
[3:44:47.400 --> 3:44:52.240]  with even more debt payable to globalist institutions such as the IMF.
[3:44:52.240 --> 3:44:57.680]  Speaking yesterday at the climate change summit in Copenhagen, the financier said that a hundred
[3:44:57.680 --> 3:45:03.280]  billion should be provided in loans to poorer nations to help slowing global warming, loans
[3:45:03.280 --> 3:45:06.040]  taken from the West and carbon tax.
[3:45:06.040 --> 3:45:09.800]  The proposal would entail third world countries paying back interest to governments of the
[3:45:09.800 --> 3:45:14.440]  richer nations to stem a perceived crisis that they had little or no direct involvement
[3:45:14.440 --> 3:45:16.000]  in manufacturing.
[3:45:16.000 --> 3:45:20.040]  Also said the loans could be backed by special drawing rights, a synthetic international
[3:45:20.040 --> 3:45:25.640]  currency issued by the International Monetary Fund, and that's the new global currency.
[3:45:25.640 --> 3:45:33.040]  You understand, a private IMF World Bank consortium will tax you and set up a world transportation
[3:45:33.040 --> 3:45:39.680]  authority to tax aircraft ships, law the sea treaty, times of London today, 400 years of
[3:45:39.680 --> 3:45:41.720]  freedom on the seas are over.
[3:45:41.720 --> 3:45:45.400]  You watch the video on the site, they're saying they're going to restrict you eating
[3:45:45.400 --> 3:45:48.040]  meat.
[3:45:48.040 --> 3:45:49.600]  It gets worse though.
[3:45:49.600 --> 3:45:51.840]  Here's the Wall Street Journal today.
[3:45:51.840 --> 3:45:56.840]  I pledge allegiance to global warming.
[3:45:56.840 --> 3:46:03.040]  British scientists caught faking science data and hiding the decline, signed a government
[3:46:03.040 --> 3:46:04.040]  loyalty oath.
[3:46:04.040 --> 3:46:08.400]  They've gone around saying you have to sign a government loyalty oath confirming that
[3:46:08.400 --> 3:46:11.360]  you believe climate change is manmade.
[3:46:11.360 --> 3:46:16.120]  The Met Office, Britain's national weather service, is embarked on an urgent exercise
[3:46:16.120 --> 3:46:20.040]  to bolster the reputation of the climate change science in the wake of the whistleblower revelation
[3:46:20.040 --> 3:46:24.240]  of widespread misconduct by climate scientists, the London Times reports.
[3:46:24.240 --> 3:46:28.760]  More than 1,700 scientists have agreed to sign a statement defending the professional
[3:46:28.760 --> 3:46:30.780]  integrity of global warming research.
[3:46:30.780 --> 3:46:36.640]  They are responding to a round robin request by the Met Office, which has spent four days
[3:46:36.640 --> 3:46:37.720]  collecting signatures.
[3:46:37.720 --> 3:46:40.520]  One scientist told the Times he felt under pressure to sign.
[3:46:40.520 --> 3:46:45.660]  The Met Office and a major employer of scientists has long had a policy of only appointing and
[3:46:45.660 --> 3:46:49.640]  working with those who subscribe to their views on manmade global warming.
[3:46:49.640 --> 3:46:53.600]  You can't get a climate grant from government or big corporations or big oil, they're the
[3:46:53.600 --> 3:46:58.200]  main ones funding this fraud when the media says they're actually against it.
[3:46:58.200 --> 3:47:02.480]  The concept of scientists or journalists or artists signing a petition is ludicrous.
[3:47:02.480 --> 3:47:07.120]  The idea that they are lending their authority to whatever cause the petition represents,
[3:47:07.120 --> 3:47:10.600]  but in fact, they are undermining the authority, which is based on the presumption that they
[3:47:10.600 --> 3:47:12.480]  think for themselves.
[3:47:12.480 --> 3:47:13.480]  Absolutely.
[3:47:13.480 --> 3:47:21.440]  Oh, my gosh, and it just goes on and on and on.
[3:47:21.440 --> 3:47:23.200]  In fact, here are the deleted comments.
[3:47:23.200 --> 3:47:32.640]  I actually did print some of these at my house this morning, and it goes on to say, you make
[3:47:32.640 --> 3:47:34.200]  me ashamed of living in Canada.
[3:47:34.200 --> 3:47:35.600]  This is to the national post.
[3:47:35.600 --> 3:47:39.240]  If you're first born, it's too bad your mother had you.
[3:47:39.240 --> 3:47:42.160]  If you're not, she would have started with you.
[3:47:42.160 --> 3:47:44.400]  You're a heartless, dirty woman and a shame on you.
[3:47:44.400 --> 3:47:49.640]  Ask the Chinese people who fled their country and came to Canada and the U.S. exactly where
[3:47:49.640 --> 3:47:52.400]  they are here, hang your head in shame.
[3:47:52.400 --> 3:47:57.720]  This is malthusian junk science is still proposed from time to time speaks of the fact that
[3:47:57.720 --> 3:48:03.280]  some in academia just refused to learn from empirical evidence.
[3:48:03.280 --> 3:48:05.520]  And now it's slipped into journalism.
[3:48:05.520 --> 3:48:08.200]  The management of the financial post should be quite embarrassed.
[3:48:08.200 --> 3:48:12.880]  I just stick to the Wall Street Journal and do not bother coming back here anymore.
[3:48:12.880 --> 3:48:16.800]  An editorial board that thinks this is worthy of publication couldn't possibly know how
[3:48:16.800 --> 3:48:19.200]  to edit a newspaper or website.
[3:48:19.200 --> 3:48:22.720]  Those who believe in global warming, one child may be a solution.
[3:48:22.720 --> 3:48:27.640]  Here in Iowa, USA, you may find a lot of folks who believe in global cooling.
[3:48:27.640 --> 3:48:30.560]  For us in the USA, it would be the opposite.
[3:48:30.560 --> 3:48:36.240]  We need as many babies as possible to grow up and work to pay for the rapidly disappearing
[3:48:36.240 --> 3:48:38.160]  social security and Medicare system.
[3:48:38.160 --> 3:48:42.720]  See, I am some of the first comments I saw at a Paul Watson to put an article and then
[3:48:42.720 --> 3:48:46.720]  they removed them off the newspaper.
[3:48:46.720 --> 3:48:48.280]  Here's some more.
[3:48:48.280 --> 3:48:49.280]  I knew it.
[3:48:49.280 --> 3:48:53.280]  According to Wikipedia, Ms. Francis is married with two children, typical liberal.
[3:48:53.280 --> 3:48:54.280]  They're not liberal folks.
[3:48:54.280 --> 3:48:57.560]  They're eugenicists telling others how to live while not doing it yourself.
[3:48:57.560 --> 3:49:00.280]  It's like Ted Turner has five kids that says you shouldn't be able to have any.
[3:49:00.280 --> 3:49:02.240]  They're paying for it either.
[3:49:02.240 --> 3:49:03.800]  Audit this fool.
[3:49:03.800 --> 3:49:05.320]  This reporter is a complete nut job.
[3:49:05.320 --> 3:49:08.640]  I can't believe anyone in North America and country would actually believe in this legitimate
[3:49:08.640 --> 3:49:09.640]  idea.
[3:49:09.640 --> 3:49:12.320]  And by the way, China's policy has had major consequences.
[3:49:12.320 --> 3:49:14.360]  Many girl babies were aborted and killed.
[3:49:14.360 --> 3:49:18.320]  And due to the scarcity of Chinese women, Chinese men are paying for the nose to obtain
[3:49:18.320 --> 3:49:19.320]  bribes.
[3:49:19.320 --> 3:49:24.400]  Therefore, lives are unfulfilled and the Chinese population decreases much further
[3:49:24.400 --> 3:49:27.800]  than any they ever desired.
[3:49:27.800 --> 3:49:31.200]  Who does this person think she is?
[3:49:31.200 --> 3:49:37.080]  Why doesn't she do everyone a favor and start thinning the herd by killing herself?
[3:49:37.080 --> 3:49:40.000]  It's hard to believe that this opinionated rant is called journalism.
[3:49:40.000 --> 3:49:42.800]  I saw no evidence of journalistic balance, fairness or objectivity.
[3:49:42.800 --> 3:49:47.320]  She made no mention of the grave problems caused by the one child policy in China, including
[3:49:47.320 --> 3:49:54.360]  forced abortions, sterilizations, heavy fines, disparate sex ratio, and fantasies on females,
[3:49:54.360 --> 3:49:58.360]  mixed in mental health problems, including Chinese women's suicide rates.
[3:49:58.360 --> 3:50:04.760]  Thank God I saved those before they went down the memory hole.
[3:50:04.760 --> 3:50:06.160]  I mean, it's incredible.
[3:50:06.160 --> 3:50:10.160]  I come into the office, I go print the comments from that, every comment's against them.
[3:50:10.160 --> 3:50:13.280]  And then they print it and all the comments against her are deleted.
[3:50:13.280 --> 3:50:17.160]  And I guarantee you the newspaper's there under dummy accounts going, oh yes, I love
[3:50:17.160 --> 3:50:18.160]  your article.
[3:50:18.160 --> 3:50:19.160]  It's so wonderful.
[3:50:19.160 --> 3:50:23.040]  Let's kill everyone.
[3:50:23.040 --> 3:50:25.800]  All these years they said there was no world government.
[3:50:25.800 --> 3:50:28.920]  All these years they said we were kooks.
[3:50:28.920 --> 3:50:35.920]  And then now they openly call for a planetary regime to force one child policies on everyone.
[3:50:35.920 --> 3:50:40.840]  Oh man, I'll take a few final calls in the final segment.
[3:50:40.840 --> 3:50:41.840]  What an incredible week.
[3:50:41.840 --> 3:50:43.120]  Back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[3:50:43.120 --> 3:50:46.800]  Central with abbreviated Sunday Transmission.
[3:50:46.800 --> 3:50:51.600]  Get angry, get focused, get aggressive, start getting in these people's faces, let them
[3:50:51.600 --> 3:50:55.520]  know that we're fully aware that eugenics sprung out of England in the U.S., was picked
[3:50:55.520 --> 3:51:02.000]  up by Hitler, and that these control freaks want a planetary dictatorship to call our
[3:51:02.000 --> 3:51:03.000]  numbers.
[3:51:03.000 --> 3:51:08.560]  Hello, at ofthefield.com we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[3:51:08.560 --> 3:51:13.480]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on ofthefield.com.
[3:51:13.480 --> 3:51:18.400]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[3:51:18.400 --> 3:51:22.400]  As a homesteader attempting to live sustainably, I was floored by the amount of information
[3:51:22.400 --> 3:51:23.400]  in this book.
[3:51:23.400 --> 3:51:27.240]  Dear Linda, I would be hard pressed to express how much you have impacted my life.
[3:51:27.240 --> 3:51:30.920]  I'm amazed by the wealth of the author's knowledge and the depth of the coverage in
[3:51:30.920 --> 3:51:31.920]  this book.
[3:51:31.920 --> 3:51:36.080]  As we see more and more GMO foods on the shelves, this information is good to know.
[3:51:36.080 --> 3:51:38.080]  I am thankful to God for you, Linda.
[3:51:38.080 --> 3:51:40.480]  I can't say enough about this book.
[3:51:40.480 --> 3:51:42.320]  Blessings to you and your family.
[3:51:42.320 --> 3:51:46.640]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see Earth's
[3:51:46.640 --> 3:51:48.000]  bouncy everywhere.
[3:51:48.000 --> 3:51:51.680]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[3:51:51.680 --> 3:51:55.120]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[3:51:55.120 --> 3:52:01.600]  You can order online for you and your loved ones, or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in
[3:52:01.600 --> 3:52:04.760]  the secret.
[3:52:04.760 --> 3:52:08.480]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:52:08.480 --> 3:52:11.640]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:52:11.640 --> 3:52:16.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[3:52:16.000 --> 3:52:17.000]  at home.
[3:52:17.000 --> 3:52:22.120]  We have tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the
[3:52:22.120 --> 3:52:23.120]  shots.
[3:52:23.120 --> 3:52:28.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:52:28.000 --> 3:52:31.240]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[3:52:31.240 --> 3:52:37.080]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing
[3:52:37.080 --> 3:52:38.080]  world government.
[3:52:38.080 --> 3:52:40.480]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[3:52:40.480 --> 3:52:44.640]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[3:52:44.640 --> 3:52:50.480]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[3:52:50.480 --> 3:52:51.480]  of the Republic.
[3:52:51.480 --> 3:52:56.320]  Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[3:52:56.320 --> 3:53:04.000]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[3:53:04.000 --> 3:53:05.880]  This is Big John Lipscomb.
[3:53:05.880 --> 3:53:09.440]  World government and all its tyranny is rapidly approaching.
[3:53:09.440 --> 3:53:14.120]  The choices you make today will determine your level of suffering and freedom tomorrow.
[3:53:14.120 --> 3:53:20.320]  I have two solutions for you, so you and your family can stay strong and free.
[3:53:20.320 --> 3:53:27.680]  PatriotFood.com, 135 pounds of long-lasting dehydrated food in 25 varieties.
[3:53:27.680 --> 3:53:33.440]  That's one-fourth the cost of many freeze-dried offers of the same weight.
[3:53:33.440 --> 3:53:40.640]  And SurvivalSeeds.com, where I just released my best offer ever, 7,000 heirloom vegetable
[3:53:40.640 --> 3:53:43.840]  seeds, 30 varieties of vegetables.
[3:53:43.840 --> 3:53:50.160]  It's over 4 pounds of seed, and I ship it in a time capsule so they will last decades.
[3:53:50.160 --> 3:53:54.800]  And now, you can get a second for a $60 savings.
[3:53:54.800 --> 3:54:22.720]  PatriotFood.com and SurvivalSeeds.com, anything else is just a copycat.
[3:54:22.720 --> 3:54:25.720]  Alexi in Washington, you're on the air.
[3:54:25.720 --> 3:54:26.720]  Hello, Alex.
[3:54:26.720 --> 3:54:27.720]  Hi, go ahead.
[3:54:27.720 --> 3:54:28.720]  Hi.
[3:54:28.720 --> 3:54:32.600]  Just let me say, I love your show.
[3:54:32.600 --> 3:54:34.200]  I've been listening for a long time.
[3:54:34.200 --> 3:54:40.840]  I'm a great fan and listener, and I know everything you're saying is fact, fact, fact.
[3:54:40.840 --> 3:54:43.760]  And people need to wake up and understand that.
[3:54:43.760 --> 3:54:48.960]  I have been chasing children for a long time, 10 years.
[3:54:48.960 --> 3:54:54.920]  And what Bob Chapman just said about the Illuminati and the pedophiles is absolutely true.
[3:54:54.920 --> 3:55:00.200]  I would like to do a radio show on your channel about just children.
[3:55:00.200 --> 3:55:04.400]  Well, the way the government preys on them, and I appreciate your call, send us some info
[3:55:04.400 --> 3:55:13.160]  then, Alexa, the way the Just Department admits, CPS is five times more likely to abuse children
[3:55:13.160 --> 3:55:15.840]  in every state than any other group.
[3:55:15.840 --> 3:55:22.880]  They're the most egregious, I mean, any criminologist will tell you, pedophiles try to become truancy
[3:55:22.880 --> 3:55:27.600]  officers, they try to become school teachers, they try to become CPS, and they've caught
[3:55:27.600 --> 3:55:33.280]  them all over the country, and they take people's children without due process, and it is monstrous.
[3:55:33.280 --> 3:55:35.080]  Let's talk to Robert Illinois, moving quickly.
[3:55:35.080 --> 3:55:36.080]  Go ahead, Robert.
[3:55:36.080 --> 3:55:37.080]  Mr. Jones.
[3:55:37.080 --> 3:55:38.080]  Yes, sir.
[3:55:38.080 --> 3:55:45.440]  Yeah, I was in, I'm in Chicago here, I listened to another program earlier today in NPR, it's
[3:55:45.440 --> 3:55:50.560]  a locally produced world view, and they had a global warming special, they had a quiz
[3:55:50.560 --> 3:55:56.920]  on there and everything, they were disparaging what they called global warming doubters,
[3:55:56.920 --> 3:56:02.000]  and in their quiz one of the questions was how many people in the UK do not believe in
[3:56:02.000 --> 3:56:05.360]  global warming, and it was approximately one in two, I can't remember the exact number
[3:56:05.360 --> 3:56:06.360]  I was in my car.
[3:56:06.360 --> 3:56:10.320]  Yeah, that's not true, those are cook numbers, about 60% in the US now, I don't believe
[3:56:10.320 --> 3:56:12.320]  it, it's 50-50 in the UK.
[3:56:12.320 --> 3:56:17.720]  Yeah, exactly, it was about 50-50, and I just thought it was interesting to statistic these
[3:56:17.720 --> 3:56:22.520]  people on here from the Fira club, and whatnot there, they were just laughing at everyone.
[3:56:22.520 --> 3:56:28.640]  Well, I mean, look, being a fake liberal is about being a eugenicist, about being a control
[3:56:28.640 --> 3:56:34.360]  freak, about everyone's stupid but you, that's how they get in these clubs, oh, you, you're
[3:56:34.360 --> 3:56:39.120]  smart, you understand we have to forcibly reduce world population, and manage and run
[3:56:39.120 --> 3:56:44.960]  things, and get a lot of money and power for yourself while you do it, and they're all
[3:56:44.960 --> 3:56:51.600]  the same, they're not liberals at all, they're just absolutely disgusting people, Bob in
[3:56:51.600 --> 3:56:53.960]  Missouri, you're on the air, go ahead.
[3:56:53.960 --> 3:57:02.520]  Where I'm coming from, I voted for Bush twice, it was so easy, all I had to do was hold my
[3:57:02.520 --> 3:57:07.520]  nose and put the X there, but I got, I want to plant three ideas to you.
[3:57:07.520 --> 3:57:09.280]  Go ahead.
[3:57:09.280 --> 3:57:14.960]  Can we find, can we find a million patriots that'll contribute a dollar a day to some
[3:57:14.960 --> 3:57:17.840]  kind of a patriotic fund?
[3:57:17.840 --> 3:57:21.520]  You know, money alone won't do it, the globalists have trillions and they're having trouble
[3:57:21.520 --> 3:57:27.040]  running their system, it's ideas, it's human action, people resisting, Leslie in Oklahoma,
[3:57:27.040 --> 3:57:28.920]  you're on the air, go ahead.
[3:57:28.920 --> 3:57:36.000]  Alex, I just wanted to not only thank you, but also thank your wife and kids for their
[3:57:36.000 --> 3:57:43.080]  sacrifice, their time away from you, so you could get the truth out to the rest of us.
[3:57:43.080 --> 3:57:48.520]  Thank you, it is all consuming, but I tell you, for any prices we've paid, the dividends
[3:57:48.520 --> 3:57:52.600]  of liberty and freedom and the awakening is worth it, so I appreciate those kind words,
[3:57:52.600 --> 3:57:53.600]  Leslie, anything else?
[3:57:53.600 --> 3:57:56.360]  That was it, thank you so much.
[3:57:56.360 --> 3:57:57.360]  You bet, thank you.
