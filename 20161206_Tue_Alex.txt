[00:00.000 --> 00:27.000]  It's not a real one, Shuffie.
[00:27.000 --> 00:36.000]  From the Infoworse.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:36.000 --> 00:44.000]  You're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy tank-over.
[00:44.000 --> 00:47.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:47.000 --> 01:04.000]  If you want it, baby, you're about to get it.
[01:04.000 --> 01:29.000]  You're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy tank-over.
[01:29.000 --> 01:47.000]  It's Tuesday, December 6, 2016.
[01:47.000 --> 01:49.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:49.000 --> 01:56.000]  We're going to be here for the next four hours live coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin.
[01:56.000 --> 02:01.000]  I have got to behave myself and cover this news today because it is the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[02:01.000 --> 02:05.000]  There is so much to go over.
[02:05.000 --> 02:16.000]  Now, Paul Watson wrote about different recounts taking place in Michigan and other states financed by Jill Stein, the Democratic Party, via the Green Party.
[02:16.000 --> 02:23.000]  And his number was there were 10,700-plus votes that were basically taken away from Trump and given to Hillary.
[02:23.000 --> 02:28.000]  The new numbers, because he was going from numbers that were out yesterday, new numbers just came out minutes ago.
[02:28.000 --> 02:31.000]  An article is going up on info wars.com.
[02:31.000 --> 02:37.000]  It's now 17,000-plus votes extra for Trump.
[02:37.000 --> 02:40.000]  And they found less than 2,000 extra for Hillary.
[02:40.000 --> 02:48.000]  So clearly, as usual, the election fraud is leaning at Trump via the Democrats.
[02:48.000 --> 02:57.000]  Oh, I'm sorry. It's now 18,422. An hour ago in my office, it was 17,000. Excuse me.
[02:57.000 --> 03:06.000]  So as the recount on goes, just every hour, it's thousands, thousands more votes that didn't go to Hillary that went to Trump.
[03:06.000 --> 03:08.000]  So are they stopping the recount?
[03:08.000 --> 03:11.000]  Oh, no, they're dragging their feet as slowly as possible.
[03:11.000 --> 03:15.000]  So that coming up on the 19th, it's not prepared. It's not ready.
[03:15.000 --> 03:24.000]  It has to be done. They're saying by the 13th to send the numbers on, or I guess it just holds up all the electoral college votes that Michigan has.
[03:24.000 --> 03:26.000]  And that is the goal here.
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.000]  Oh, and the other states with the recounts, it's the same thing.
[03:30.000 --> 03:40.000]  Three to one, five to one, sometimes more votes taken from Trump given to Hillary Clinton.
[03:40.000 --> 03:48.000]  Certainly breaking it all down here today, but there it is from the official state website, printouts, 18,000 plus for Trump.
[03:48.000 --> 03:59.000]  As Trump said, there'd be millions and millions of people out there voting illegally and people voting in the place of dead people.
[03:59.000 --> 04:03.000]  And the millions of those votes would be going to him if there was a national recount.
[04:03.000 --> 04:06.000]  And now it appears Trump's right again.
[04:06.000 --> 04:17.000]  The Democrats in seven states passed laws out of their legislatures that governors wouldn't sign as a violated federal law saying let illegals vote.
[04:17.000 --> 04:25.000]  If somebody gets here from China and it's here a month they can vote, or from Germany they can vote, or from Mexico, you can't do that anywhere else.
[04:25.000 --> 04:26.000]  This is astounding.
[04:26.000 --> 04:33.000]  Now, that is one article out of hundreds, and they're all just as insane.
[04:33.000 --> 04:39.000]  Now that's some good news right there. Let me give you some bad news, ladies and gentlemen, when we get back.
[04:39.000 --> 04:46.000]  And it's all being concerted, it's all being coupled and coordinated with the government here in Obama's last 44 days.
[04:46.000 --> 04:56.000]  EU demands social media websites censor fake news within 24 hours, and now they're calling on CNBC to ban this show.
[04:56.000 --> 05:00.000]  That's right, ban me. Stay with us, we'll be back.
[05:00.000 --> 05:11.000]  Loretta Lynch's Department of Justice just slapped Colorado's largest sheriff's department last month with a $10,000 fine and ordered them to take steps to correct their discriminatory hiring practices.
[05:11.000 --> 05:15.000]  The illegal act the sheriff's department committed, you ask, well they hired only U.S. citizens.
[05:15.000 --> 05:25.000]  Now, in a summary of the settlement on the DOJ's website, they said that insisting on U.S. citizenship violates an anti-discrimination provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act.
[05:25.000 --> 05:30.000]  It forbids employers from hiring only U.S. citizens, except in cases where it's mandated by law.
[05:30.000 --> 05:35.000]  Now, the Denver Sheriff's Department maintains that it's committed to treating all people fairly with dignity and respect.
[05:35.000 --> 05:39.000]  They're, of course, cleaning up their practices now, and they vowed not to do it again.
[05:39.000 --> 05:45.000]  More than 40 states have rules in place keeping law enforcement agencies from hiring non-citizens.
[05:45.000 --> 05:51.000]  Only Colorado, Louisiana, Maine, and Vermont, as well as West Virginia, have no such statewide restriction,
[05:51.000 --> 05:57.000]  which means that Colorado is a target for the DOJ if they continue to hire only U.S. citizens.
[05:57.000 --> 06:23.000]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for Infowars.com.
[06:23.000 --> 06:28.000]  Oh, yeah.
[06:28.000 --> 06:30.000]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[06:30.000 --> 06:33.000]  It's time to ride, boys. We need a thousand Paul Revere's.
[06:33.000 --> 06:39.000]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie.
[06:39.000 --> 06:42.000]  And beef was for supper.
[06:42.000 --> 06:48.000]  Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available,
[06:48.000 --> 06:53.000]  starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General, Jerry Boykin.
[06:53.000 --> 06:56.000]  Want to shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[06:56.000 --> 07:00.000]  Revelation, the movie.info. Let's fix it.
[07:00.000 --> 07:04.000]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[07:04.000 --> 07:07.000]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[07:07.000 --> 07:13.000]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[07:13.000 --> 07:19.000]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure ground-breaking water filtration systems
[07:19.000 --> 07:22.000]  have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[07:22.000 --> 07:27.000]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children.
[07:27.000 --> 07:29.000]  It's the best job you can to purify your air.
[07:29.000 --> 07:34.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate
[07:34.000 --> 07:37.000]  or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[07:37.000 --> 07:39.000]  The general public doesn't.
[07:39.000 --> 07:43.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[07:43.000 --> 07:47.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[07:47.000 --> 07:50.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house,
[07:50.000 --> 07:54.000]  replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[07:54.000 --> 07:57.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today.
[07:57.000 --> 08:10.000]  www.FullWareStore.com
[08:27.000 --> 08:32.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[08:32.000 --> 08:39.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[08:39.000 --> 08:58.000]  On this live, original Tuesday, December 6, 2016, global transmission,
[08:58.000 --> 09:00.000]  I come to you with extremely good news.
[09:00.000 --> 09:05.000]  My fellow humans, my fellow Liberty lovers across this globe,
[09:05.000 --> 09:11.000]  humanity is awakening at a alarming rate to the New World Order,
[09:11.000 --> 09:13.000]  and so they are pulling out the stops.
[09:13.000 --> 09:19.000]  The EU has come out, the official government, the unelected bureaucracy,
[09:19.000 --> 09:22.000]  that 20-plus nations never voted to enter,
[09:22.000 --> 09:25.000]  but just magically took them over by covert stealth,
[09:25.000 --> 09:31.000]  has issued an edict to block using basically a Washington Post list
[09:31.000 --> 09:35.000]  that they used from some nebulous, unnamed website,
[09:35.000 --> 09:40.000]  we don't even know who runs it or owns it, just a magic website,
[09:40.000 --> 09:51.000]  that if, in 24 hours, Google and all these other major internet service providers
[09:51.000 --> 09:56.000]  have not blocked that list that includes infowars.com and brightbark.com
[09:56.000 --> 10:00.000]  and rogerport.com, that they will start finding them and take them to court.
[10:00.000 --> 10:03.000]  Now, let's just pull back here because this is so staggering,
[10:03.000 --> 10:07.000]  so over the top that I have trouble even believing it's happening.
[10:07.000 --> 10:13.000]  A year ago, and change, Matt Drudge gave us an exclusive interview,
[10:13.000 --> 10:18.000]  he came to this studio, and in the shadows about 15 feet away,
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  on a mobile mic,
[10:20.000 --> 10:24.000]  wrote down the fact that in 2016 they were going to drop the hammer,
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.000]  whether Republicans got an office or whether Democrats got an office,
[10:28.000 --> 10:33.000]  that the globalists were moving to censor the internet
[10:33.000 --> 10:39.000]  and to shut down nationalist and populist information.
[10:39.000 --> 10:43.000]  And he had a lengthy dinner with a sitting Supreme Court justice.
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.000]  One of the good guys is dead now, so it's not hard to imagine who.
[10:47.000 --> 10:52.000]  But it's a living Supreme Court justice.
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.000]  And that Supreme Court justice said,
[10:54.000 --> 10:58.000]  I've been briefed, they're ending free speech starting in 2016,
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  they're going to make their move.
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.000]  They came here to warn you and say this is coming.
[11:05.000 --> 11:09.000]  It wasn't just some local newspaper claiming they talked to the Supreme Court justice,
[11:09.000 --> 11:16.000]  it wasn't, it was Matt Drudge, the reclusive king of news.
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.000]  Here to tell you and to warn you this was coming.
[11:20.000 --> 11:24.000]  Now, how do you come in and announce you're going to have Chinese-style communist censorship?
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  You call it fake news.
[11:26.000 --> 11:31.000]  The communist Chinese, for decades, since they've had internet,
[11:31.000 --> 11:34.000]  have been arresting people, putting out information critical of the government,
[11:34.000 --> 11:38.000]  critical of stocks, bonds, anything, negative, basically.
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.000]  And they arrest them saying it doesn't exist, you're insane,
[11:42.000 --> 11:45.000]  we're going to put you in a mental institution.
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.000]  And if you look at what Europe's doing, what the US is doing,
[11:47.000 --> 11:50.000]  it dovetails with the line that you're mentally ill.
[11:50.000 --> 11:54.000]  The morning show this morning called for internet censorship
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.000]  of anyone talking about the Podesta WikiLeaks emails
[11:58.000 --> 12:01.000]  that are clearly using code words
[12:01.000 --> 12:07.000]  and talking about the president wanting $65,000 of succulent hot dogs to enjoy.
[12:07.000 --> 12:14.000]  And the three kids will be in the hot tub for your entertainment.
[12:14.000 --> 12:21.000]  And we have the FBI's own training manuals
[12:21.000 --> 12:27.000]  that you can go to and we put them in reports.
[12:27.000 --> 12:32.000]  We're putting them on screens showing the code words and symbols that are used.
[12:32.000 --> 12:39.000]  And it's pizza, pizza with cheese.
[12:39.000 --> 12:44.000]  Sources are, oh, it's walnut sauce, that means people of color.
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  This is known, okay?
[12:46.000 --> 12:51.000]  And it's all in there and you've had major whistleblowers come out and say that this is going on.
[12:51.000 --> 12:57.000]  Does that mean everyone involved in the emails is doing something wrong?
[12:57.000 --> 12:58.000]  Absolutely not.
[12:58.000 --> 13:05.000]  But the point is, is that we know about the Lolita Express and Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Clinton.
[13:05.000 --> 13:10.000]  There's a convicted pedophile now and the Pleasure Island with the kidnapped kids.
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.000]  We know about Boys Town and we know about the Call Boys to the White House.
[13:14.000 --> 13:18.000]  That's the Washington Times and we know about Penn State.
[13:18.000 --> 13:21.000]  We know about the Catholic Church and we know about all of this.
[13:21.000 --> 13:25.000]  And how did the Jesuits, now run by communists openly,
[13:25.000 --> 13:30.000]  take over the Catholic Church a few years ago with a blackmail scandal over pedophilia?
[13:30.000 --> 13:32.000]  That was even in the Guardian.
[13:32.000 --> 13:37.000]  So when the Guardian reports on the fact that blackmail was used to put Pope Francis in
[13:37.000 --> 13:41.000]  and to have the other Pope, rat singer, run off to Gandalf Castle.
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.000]  That's where he stays now.
[13:43.000 --> 13:48.000]  Not from Lord of the Rings, Gandalfi Castle.
[13:48.000 --> 13:53.000]  Is the mainstream media going to say that's a conspiracy theory or an hallucination?
[13:53.000 --> 14:00.000]  Because on the morning show, they use the words hallucination and that people are hallucinating.
[14:00.000 --> 14:03.000]  And WikiLeaks even release this information.
[14:03.000 --> 14:06.000]  I guess that's a hallucination too.
[14:06.000 --> 14:13.000]  So this is a literal so-called Jedi mind trick where they are looking at everybody
[14:13.000 --> 14:17.000]  and saying you didn't just see what you just saw.
[14:17.000 --> 14:20.000]  These aren't the droids you're looking for move along.
[14:20.000 --> 14:26.000]  And notice they're putting their list in now before Trump gets in in 44 days.
[14:26.000 --> 14:33.000]  Notice they're pushing this all now, trying to get it in place as a new bureaucratic regime before Trump gets in.
[14:33.000 --> 14:38.000]  So we're going to put up, coming up this afternoon, our first ever petition.
[14:38.000 --> 14:39.000]  Not to the White House.
[14:39.000 --> 14:40.000]  We've done those.
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  They've had hundreds of thousands of people sign up for it.
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.000]  Really all it is is that we've now learned the White House getting your email to use it in the database
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  so they can spam you with this info.
[14:48.000 --> 14:54.000]  But it served its purpose because we took it over and it would get national attention on the points we put in there.
[14:54.000 --> 14:59.000]  But no, we're going to have our own petition so we can deliver it to Donald Trump,
[14:59.000 --> 15:02.000]  who I assure you pays attention and listens.
[15:02.000 --> 15:08.000]  And so we can also coordinate and try to organize people into a free speech movement to defend free speech.
[15:08.000 --> 15:11.000]  We've got a lot of tricks up our sleeves, but they actually try to delist us.
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  They've already done it on Google Chrome.
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.000]  They've already done a lot of platforms already delisting Breitbart on Apple iTunes.
[15:18.000 --> 15:19.000]  This is here.
[15:19.000 --> 15:22.000]  People better take this very, very seriously.
[15:22.000 --> 15:23.000]  And so should Donald Trump.
[15:23.000 --> 15:30.000]  And when I deliver him digitally, these petitions, and I'm also going to print them off for effect,
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.000]  when I have those delivered to Trump Tower next week,
[15:33.000 --> 15:36.000]  we're going to start this today, run it right through next week.
[15:36.000 --> 15:40.000]  When I have those delivered, it'll probably be wheelbarrows of them.
[15:40.000 --> 15:45.000]  We're going to print them all off with a petition and a comment on there.
[15:45.000 --> 15:49.000]  We're going to try to set up where you have a comment as well to a president that actually listens.
[15:49.000 --> 15:53.000]  We're going to say Mr. President in the cover sheet.
[15:53.000 --> 15:56.000]  You notice just last week they called to kick you off Twitter.
[15:56.000 --> 16:00.000]  They had the Washington Post, the New York Times tell Twitter, kick Trump off.
[16:00.000 --> 16:01.000]  He's a bully.
[16:01.000 --> 16:06.000]  Yeah, he stands up to bullies like you.
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.000]  He calls people out.
[16:08.000 --> 16:14.000]  The media does everything they can to show, you know, weird screenshots of him, freeze framed.
[16:14.000 --> 16:19.000]  All of it is deception by an enemy media combine hell-bent on enslaving this nation,
[16:19.000 --> 16:22.000]  and we're standing up against it.
[16:22.000 --> 16:26.000]  So EU demands social media websites censor fake news for 24 hours.
[16:26.000 --> 16:29.000]  Infowars.com, Paul Joseph Watson.
[16:29.000 --> 16:34.000]  We need this article to go completely and totally viral now.
[16:34.000 --> 16:38.000]  I'm going to read over it in a moment, but don't forget.
[16:38.000 --> 16:41.000]  Twitter says it would consider banning Donald Trump's account.
[16:41.000 --> 16:44.000]  That's in response to the MSM saying ban him.
[16:44.000 --> 16:47.000]  If they can ban him, they can ban everybody.
[16:47.000 --> 16:49.000]  Oh, but they decide it's fake.
[16:49.000 --> 16:52.000]  Your Facebook comments, they say are fake.
[16:52.000 --> 16:53.000]  No judge, no jury.
[16:53.000 --> 16:55.000]  Nobody sues you to prove libel or defamation.
[16:55.000 --> 17:00.000]  Just you're off Facebook, you're off Twitter, you're off YouTube.
[17:00.000 --> 17:02.000]  And that's what they're demanding.
[17:02.000 --> 17:05.000]  And that'll be used as the model here, the new EU model.
[17:05.000 --> 17:08.000]  You'll see it if they put it in place, which they say is going to happen today.
[17:08.000 --> 17:14.000]  Then you'll hear our media go, our MSM go, oh, see, it's the EU government list.
[17:14.000 --> 17:15.000]  And so it's official.
[17:15.000 --> 17:20.000]  We're going to follow it too.
[17:20.000 --> 17:27.000]  So they're moving to D list where you cannot post our material or visit info wars.com in Europe.
[17:27.000 --> 17:29.000]  We told you it was coming.
[17:29.000 --> 17:30.000]  It's incredible.
[17:30.000 --> 17:31.000]  It's actually happening.
[17:31.000 --> 17:35.000]  And they want to even censor the president of the United States.
[17:35.000 --> 17:39.000]  That's how deceptive they are because they've imploded the mainstream media has died.
[17:39.000 --> 17:42.000]  And I want to explain something to everybody.
[17:42.000 --> 17:46.000]  Trump is destroying them by exposing their monopolies.
[17:46.000 --> 17:48.000]  By exposing globalism.
[17:48.000 --> 17:49.000]  Trump is a godsend.
[17:49.000 --> 17:51.000]  It's why they hate him so much.
[17:51.000 --> 17:55.000]  Trump has already delivered, not just bringing jobs back when he's only president-elect.
[17:55.000 --> 17:57.000]  Ford, Carrier, you name it.
[17:57.000 --> 18:01.000]  But exposing the one-sided deals, exposing the MSM.
[18:01.000 --> 18:03.000]  I saw a cartoon graphic.
[18:03.000 --> 18:05.000]  Somebody showed it to me and I said, please go tweet that out.
[18:05.000 --> 18:09.000]  I don't know if anybody did on Real Alex Jones because I tweet on there, but so does some of the crew.
[18:09.000 --> 18:21.000]  But it was a great cartoon of Trump throwing a football over the MSM gaggle of cameras and crews to one person symbolizing social media with their laptop open.
[18:21.000 --> 18:22.000]  And that's what's happened.
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.000]  In fact, somebody find that, please.
[18:24.000 --> 18:32.000]  I want to post it on info wars.com because that little cartoon tells a billion, billion words.
[18:32.000 --> 18:39.000]  But the key to people on social media is, don't just look at something interesting and then show it to one person, send it out.
[18:39.000 --> 18:40.000]  I forget who the crew member was.
[18:40.000 --> 18:44.000]  I said, make sure you go tell the writers about that and get that out.
[18:44.000 --> 18:45.000]  That money it wasn't done.
[18:45.000 --> 18:47.000]  They're in there looking for an hour.
[18:47.000 --> 18:54.000]  See, inside the building, I have a great crew, but they think if they talk to each other about something that's news, no, it's not.
[18:54.000 --> 18:57.000]  It's got to be put out to everybody out there.
[18:57.000 --> 19:00.000]  And you, the listeners, have to do that as well.
[19:00.000 --> 19:02.000]  See something powerful and interesting.
[19:02.000 --> 19:04.000]  You need to pay it forward.
[19:04.000 --> 19:05.000]  That's what I'm here to tell you.
[19:05.000 --> 19:07.000]  We're skipping this network break.
[19:07.000 --> 19:10.000]  This broadcast is in the process of being shut down.
[19:10.000 --> 19:14.000]  If they can kick us off the internet next, they're going to have slap suits.
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.000]  They're going to have gaggles of people come after us.
[19:16.000 --> 19:18.000]  They're already going after our sponsors.
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  They're already going after everybody else's sponsors.
[19:20.000 --> 19:21.000]  This is well known.
[19:21.000 --> 19:24.000]  We're in a war for this country right now.
[19:24.000 --> 19:40.000]  And the answer to that war is send our links, send our videos, send our articles out to everyone you know with 10 times the fervor that you've ever engaged in.
[19:40.000 --> 19:42.000]  Because they're going to get your guns.
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  They're saying your kids belong to them.
[19:44.000 --> 19:45.000]  They're going to force inoculations.
[19:45.000 --> 19:46.000]  It's already happening.
[19:46.000 --> 19:52.000]  They're going to kick you out of your regular house or apartment and make you move into a coffin apartment and charge you more for it.
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  They're going to run your life.
[19:54.000 --> 19:55.000]  They crave it.
[19:55.000 --> 19:58.000]  And we've got to get them off our back and we're in the process of doing it.
[19:58.000 --> 20:11.000]  And so because they were caught as fake news, rigging the media, working with the White House, lying about polls, engaging in disinformation, covering up racial attacks on white people and all the other tracks they're involved in and illegally opening the borders.
[20:11.000 --> 20:14.000]  They're now in full panic mode.
[20:14.000 --> 20:17.000]  And I told you their answer would be censor their competition.
[20:17.000 --> 20:19.000]  That's killing them.
[20:19.000 --> 20:21.000]  What if I covered here that isn't true?
[20:21.000 --> 20:26.000]  The FBI says what's in the Podesta emails matches pedophile code words.
[20:26.000 --> 20:29.000]  The media did call for censoring Trump.
[20:29.000 --> 20:32.000]  The EU is calling for censoring us and we're listed.
[20:32.000 --> 20:34.000]  That's all true.
[20:34.000 --> 20:41.000]  We're here covering real information they don't want you to know like this article on info wars.com right now.
[20:41.000 --> 20:43.000]  My investigative journalist Wayne Madsen.
[20:43.000 --> 20:44.000]  Open borders.
[20:44.000 --> 20:48.000]  Grab bag of valid US visas available overseas just to whoever wants them.
[20:48.000 --> 20:51.000]  Obama just gives them out.
[20:51.000 --> 20:55.000]  Here's how ISIS could enter America and they just admit it's been given.
[20:55.000 --> 20:59.000]  We're going to cover that.
[20:59.000 --> 21:06.000]  We're going to get into so much more because they're not going to just quietly go into the night.
[21:06.000 --> 21:08.000]  They're not going to just give up.
[21:08.000 --> 21:17.000]  They're going to consciously continue to move forward thinking you're in a trance thinking you're not conscious thinking you're not aware of the war you're in.
[21:17.000 --> 21:19.000]  Now here's some of the good news.
[21:19.000 --> 21:29.000]  Trump's America GOP congressman preps national concealed carry bill and Trump says he's going to sign it.
[21:29.000 --> 21:30.000]  Think that's got him freaked out.
[21:30.000 --> 21:31.000]  That's what I've called for.
[21:31.000 --> 21:34.000]  That's what we've all called for is a national concealed carry bill.
[21:34.000 --> 21:41.000]  Once that rolls out and we prove like Vermont other states that you should just have an open carry period.
[21:41.000 --> 21:44.000]  And then it just becomes open carry without even a license.
[21:44.000 --> 21:46.000]  That's already happening in what a whole bunch of states.
[21:46.000 --> 21:48.000]  This is phase one.
[21:48.000 --> 21:53.000]  Our Second Amendment right doesn't disappear when we cross state lines.
[21:53.000 --> 22:03.000]  And it allows people who already have a concealed carry again to go into other states and then it pressures the other states to follow suit and unify those laws.
[22:03.000 --> 22:05.000]  Another huge victory.
[22:05.000 --> 22:07.000]  Look at the Trump effect.
[22:07.000 --> 22:08.000]  CNBC.
[22:08.000 --> 22:09.000]  You know they hate this.
[22:09.000 --> 22:11.000]  They don't mention the fact that it's the Trump effect.
[22:11.000 --> 22:21.000]  Diners returning to restaurants after election restaurateur Danny Meyer says that they have the statistics showing massive increases in people going back out to eat.
[22:21.000 --> 22:23.000]  Because they were uncertain.
[22:23.000 --> 22:27.000]  Middle-class people making 50,000, 100,000, 200,000 dollars a year.
[22:27.000 --> 22:29.000]  You call your middle class like 65,000.
[22:29.000 --> 22:32.000]  They didn't feel confident about going out spending money now.
[22:32.000 --> 22:34.000]  The stock market's exploding.
[22:34.000 --> 22:38.000]  Investments exploding because the promise of tax cuts is around the corner.
[22:38.000 --> 22:44.000]  That'll turn up the amount of revenue coming in because there'll be more action.
[22:44.000 --> 22:48.000]  If Trump just leaves spending the same, we'll start paying down dead.
[22:48.000 --> 22:50.000]  This is known.
[22:50.000 --> 22:56.000]  The problem is no Republican with the Democrats has ever cut spending or even left it the same in the last 30, 40 years.
[22:56.000 --> 22:57.000]  They always increase it.
[22:57.000 --> 23:00.000]  Under Reagan with the Democrats, they tripled spending.
[23:00.000 --> 23:07.000]  Reagan delivered on rhetoric and tax cuts, but then a bunch of bad stuff happened like amnesty and gun control.
[23:07.000 --> 23:11.000]  Because everybody was so in love with Reagan, they just let the Democrats do whatever they wanted.
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  That's not happening this time.
[23:13.000 --> 23:20.000]  If Donald Trump delivers on a third of what he says he's going to do, he'll be the next George Washington.
[23:20.000 --> 23:25.000]  And folks, he's already delivering exposing mainstream media as a fraud, killing them.
[23:25.000 --> 23:28.000]  You understand just the fact that he beat them?
[23:28.000 --> 23:31.000]  Just the fact that the whole media tried to destroy him and they failed.
[23:31.000 --> 23:35.000]  And the fact that he's up there talking about Americanism, not globalism will be our credo.
[23:35.000 --> 23:41.000]  Do you have any idea how just him being there?
[23:41.000 --> 23:43.000]  Let's say the globalists are like a bad Superman.
[23:43.000 --> 23:46.000]  Trump's like raining kryptonite on them.
[23:46.000 --> 23:48.000]  Nowhere they go can they get away from it.
[23:48.000 --> 23:54.000]  It's over unless they can kill him or get us to be dumb enough to think that he's betrayed us.
[23:54.000 --> 23:59.000]  And if he betrays us in any real way, I'm going to go ape.
[23:59.000 --> 24:05.000]  But if he makes deals and gets us 60% of what we want on one particular piece of legislation,
[24:05.000 --> 24:12.000]  where instead of the left always saying compromise to us and then they take ground,
[24:12.000 --> 24:19.000]  if Trump starts doing what they did and taking ground, oh baby, I just want to move the ball down the field.
[24:19.000 --> 24:26.000]  The Washington Post admitted last week they said all their hopes are driving a wedge between the Breitbart people and Info Wars.
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  It said that in the headline.
[24:28.000 --> 24:34.000]  That's all they're hoping for as if we are stupid.
[24:34.000 --> 24:42.000]  So this is just unbelievably incredibly exciting time to be alive.
[24:42.000 --> 24:47.000]  Now continuing again.
[24:47.000 --> 24:55.000]  Trump came out and he knows from Pew Research is actually 20 plus million dead people and illegals that are on the rules.
[24:55.000 --> 25:01.000]  But they believe from Pew Research that's that's was covered on Fox News that we played like five times that 3 million.
[25:01.000 --> 25:05.000]  That's where I was getting those numbers that 3 million illegals.
[25:05.000 --> 25:09.000]  It looks like our voting.
[25:09.000 --> 25:14.000]  Because you can look at how many people we know are illegal on there that end up in the next time voting.
[25:14.000 --> 25:17.000]  Usually though it's the last elections numbers was probably worse.
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.000]  We know there's 4 million dead people in appears that are voting.
[25:21.000 --> 25:27.000]  And again the media plays that trick with their listeners and viewers they go oh Joan says dead have come out of graves and voting.
[25:27.000 --> 25:34.000]  No alive people are going with the Democratic Party with list of dead people that have recently died who are showing voter roles.
[25:34.000 --> 25:39.000]  And they're going in and impersonating them in the majority of states that now let you vote without an ID.
[25:39.000 --> 25:42.000]  Okay.
[25:42.000 --> 25:50.000]  So Trump comes out and says quit saying she won by a million and a half votes quit saying you know that I only won the.
[25:50.000 --> 25:56.000]  I would have won two if illegals and dead people weren't voting and they freak out and say oh it's from Alex Jones.
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  The fake news website.
[25:58.000 --> 26:03.000]  The discredited guy that told you Trump was 1015 points ahead and all the polls and they now admit the polls are broke.
[26:03.000 --> 26:04.000]  They lie and I'm right.
[26:04.000 --> 26:07.000]  But the same you have the same people all shows.
[26:07.000 --> 26:13.000]  I got that from Pew Research dumb dumb and a bunch of other publications and studies and reports.
[26:13.000 --> 26:21.000]  Now in one state I was giving numbers at the start of the show of 17,000 because that was what I saw a few hours ago.
[26:21.000 --> 26:24.000]  The latest numbers are now they're coming in hourly.
[26:24.000 --> 26:30.000]  We're 17,000 plus this morning 18,000 as of showtime.
[26:30.000 --> 26:39.000]  Guess what they were as of the last break the story is being written right now just went up on info wars.com update Trump up by 22,000 votes.
[26:39.000 --> 26:43.000]  Let's be clear that was 30 minutes ago.
[26:43.000 --> 26:52.000]  Trump up by 22,000 votes in Wisconsin recount proving his point that he would win a recount and would win.
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.000]  Let's add this because I was in there right in the headlines in the break.
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.000]  I kind of just yelled at him nicely but you know running around like a true of my head cut off.
[26:59.000 --> 27:05.000]  I'm like a Tasmanian devil around there because they weren't a total war here.
[27:05.000 --> 27:12.000]  The headline is proving his point that he would win a recount.
[27:12.000 --> 27:18.000]  Proving his point that he would gain votes in a recount and thus win the popular vote.
[27:18.000 --> 27:20.000]  That's what I'm saying.
[27:20.000 --> 27:26.000]  If he's gained 22,000 votes and they're saying they're far from done.
[27:26.000 --> 27:27.000]  They're into day five.
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.000]  They're saying because the Democrats are doing it slow.
[27:29.000 --> 27:34.000]  They're saying it may go for three more weeks.
[27:34.000 --> 27:39.000]  But that's just Michigan where she's lost 22,000 and they're not even half done.
[27:39.000 --> 27:44.000]  Oh, look at headline news.
[27:44.000 --> 27:52.000]  Hillary Clinton loses 32,423 votes in day five of Wisconsin recount.
[27:52.000 --> 27:53.000]  Wow.
[27:53.000 --> 27:54.000]  Wow.
[27:54.000 --> 27:59.000]  32,000, 22,000 and they're far from done.
[27:59.000 --> 28:10.000]  He's already at 55,000 or 54,000 plus votes in two states and they're not even half done.
[28:10.000 --> 28:13.000]  Do the math of all 50.
[28:13.000 --> 28:16.000]  Just like Bev Harris, a big Democrat, a big liberal.
[28:16.000 --> 28:17.000]  Totally respect her.
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  Anti-war for the right reasons.
[28:19.000 --> 28:23.000]  You know, just they're still good liberals but they're not the establishment.
[28:23.000 --> 28:26.000]  She called other elections as frauds had the proof.
[28:26.000 --> 28:29.000]  I agree with her when it was against Republicans because I'm not a Republican or a Democrat.
[28:29.000 --> 28:32.000]  I'm a populist and I know Trump is.
[28:32.000 --> 28:35.000]  She said every state she looked at, it was leaning against Trump.
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  The fraud was all going against him.
[28:37.000 --> 28:41.000]  Late night, weird ballot boxes coming in, all for Hillary.
[28:41.000 --> 28:42.000]  That's a fraud.
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.000]  Stole five states from him.
[28:44.000 --> 28:45.000]  Clearly.
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  Tried to steal the states he won.
[28:47.000 --> 28:48.000]  I bet you money.
[28:48.000 --> 28:55.000]  If you added up everything, I think it's conservative to say she stole millions of millions of votes.
[28:55.000 --> 28:57.000]  I mean, it's already been borne out.
[28:57.000 --> 29:00.000]  But again, they think the public are a bunch of idiots.
[29:00.000 --> 29:08.000]  And you know, you know that a lot of these fraudulent votes aren't getting caught either.
[29:08.000 --> 29:16.000]  So you'll have them find 7,800 votes supposedly for Hillary in Michigan that supposedly went wrong.
[29:16.000 --> 29:18.000]  And then 22,000 so far for Trump.
[29:18.000 --> 29:22.000]  They found less than that in Wisconsin for Hillary and way more than that for Trump.
[29:22.000 --> 29:25.000]  32,000.
[29:25.000 --> 29:26.000]  Wow.
[29:26.000 --> 29:29.000]  And Jill Stein is only targeting states.
[29:29.000 --> 29:33.000]  Trump won saying the Russians stole it.
[29:33.000 --> 29:34.000]  Wow.
[29:34.000 --> 29:36.000]  I mean, this is incredible.
[29:36.000 --> 29:39.000]  We're at all this information stories on info wars.com.
[29:39.000 --> 29:41.000]  Get out the fake news.
[29:41.000 --> 29:46.000]  According to MSM, just actual screenshots from the state websites.
[29:46.000 --> 29:49.000]  Everybody you know on Facebook and Twitter while we still can.
[29:49.000 --> 29:53.000]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[29:53.000 --> 30:00.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:00.000 --> 30:06.000]  First Brexit then Trump is Italy next for the West quote populist movement as the Guardian puts it.
[30:06.000 --> 30:12.000]  Prime Minister Matteo Rinzi announced his intention to resign after losing a crucial reform referendum.
[30:12.000 --> 30:21.000]  A global political earthquake is underway where decidedly people are standing up in westernized nations and taking back their countries from roglobalist its latest victim.
[30:21.000 --> 30:31.000]  Globalist Prime Minister Matteo Renzi who is announced that he will resign after suffering a humiliating defeat in a referendum throwing the country and the Eurozone into utter confusion.
[30:31.000 --> 30:34.000]  Now he says that the experience of my government ends here.
[30:34.000 --> 30:42.000]  Renzi said in a televised address to the nation yesterday that the results show his yes camp was well on track to losing the referendum.
[30:42.000 --> 30:45.000]  Now as he quits, arguably Heland and Merkel are next.
[30:45.000 --> 30:56.000]  This comes after MPs and senators representing the five star movement launched by Bethe Grillo decided to get four million signatures they needed to take back their country and launch a referendum.
[30:56.000 --> 31:00.000]  I'm Margaret Howe reporting for info wars.com.
[31:00.000 --> 31:09.000]  We're selling a product DNA force that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce about a group you took years for you to develop DNA force for us.
[31:09.000 --> 31:15.000]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time Alex because I think it's very, very important.
[31:15.000 --> 31:21.000]  What the aging process is is when the cell replicates we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[31:21.000 --> 31:24.000]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[31:24.000 --> 31:26.000]  And when it runs out you start dying.
[31:26.000 --> 31:30.000]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[31:30.000 --> 31:33.000]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[31:33.000 --> 31:35.000]  It works like an antioxidant.
[31:35.000 --> 31:38.000]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[31:38.000 --> 31:41.000]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[31:41.000 --> 31:42.000]  It's in powder form.
[31:42.000 --> 31:45.000]  We have so many five star reviews.
[31:45.000 --> 31:46.000]  I take this.
[31:46.000 --> 31:50.000]  This is this is the product that I take info wars life.com and the profit we make.
[31:50.000 --> 31:51.000]  We fight the global.
[31:51.000 --> 31:52.000]  We fight the new world order.

[31:59.000 --> 32:02.000]  I want to tell you about a brand new often read product.
[32:02.000 --> 32:04.000]  It's a pocket sized solar generator.
[32:04.000 --> 32:06.000]  Even though it's so small you can put it in your pocket.
[32:06.000 --> 32:13.000]  It can actually run some 110 appliances at your house like small refrigerators to keep your food from spoiling.
[32:13.000 --> 32:15.000]  The best part though, you can take it with you.
[32:15.000 --> 32:21.000]  It's mobile to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18 wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[32:21.000 --> 32:25.000]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of off the grid electricity.
[32:25.000 --> 32:28.000]  Basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[32:28.000 --> 32:29.000]  A true innovation.
[32:29.000 --> 32:31.000]  I have never seen anything like this.
[32:31.000 --> 32:33.000]  You're going to want to load up on these.
[32:33.000 --> 32:36.000]  One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[32:36.000 --> 32:40.000]  It's even a great Christmas idea if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid.
[32:40.000 --> 32:42.000]  Go to privatepowergrid.com.
[32:42.000 --> 32:45.000]  That's privatepowergrid.com and check this out.

[32:54.000 --> 32:56.000]  Privatepowergrid.com.
[32:56.000 --> 32:57.000]  Limited one for household.
[32:57.000 --> 33:25.000]  Privatepowergrid.com.
[33:25.000 --> 33:29.000]  We have the European Union official government, unelected bureaucracy.
[33:29.000 --> 33:30.000]  I'm going to cover it in a moment.
[33:30.000 --> 33:32.000]  Read their actual edicts.
[33:32.000 --> 33:35.000]  It's coming out saying, we have a list from the Washington Post.
[33:35.000 --> 33:38.000]  It came from a website and they won't say who runs the website.
[33:38.000 --> 33:44.000]  It just popped up, but we are going to ban everyone.
[33:44.000 --> 33:46.000]  I don't know why I'm doing an EU bureaucrat in the British accent.
[33:46.000 --> 33:49.000]  It just feels good.
[33:49.000 --> 34:00.000]  And so now you have 24 hours Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple and 100 plus other organizations to shut off infowalls.com.
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  We are actually listed.
[34:02.000 --> 34:08.000]  Infowalls.com will be inaccessible immediately.
[34:08.000 --> 34:10.000]  Woo!
[34:10.000 --> 34:15.000]  That's bold, baby.
[34:15.000 --> 34:19.000]  As well as drugsreports.com.
[34:19.000 --> 34:21.000]  As well as brightvotes.com.
[34:21.000 --> 34:25.000]  Is that clear?
[34:25.000 --> 34:27.000]  They are fake news.
[34:27.000 --> 34:28.000]  Oh, yeah, we're going.
[34:28.000 --> 34:38.000]  Oh, look, they're only recounting areas to block Trump and slow counting to hold it up past the December 13 date so they can take the electoral college votes and say it's all held up.
[34:38.000 --> 34:42.000]  They've got to be certified by the 13th, passed on by the 19th for the electoral college.
[34:42.000 --> 34:43.000]  Oh, sorry.
[34:43.000 --> 34:44.000]  Oh, and guess what?
[34:44.000 --> 34:50.000]  In every state where they're doing recounts, is it five to one?
[34:50.000 --> 35:02.000]  If Jill Stein's got 1,700 for Hillary in Michigan and then 22,000 for Trump in Michigan, what is that, like eight to one?
[35:02.000 --> 35:06.000]  Numbers, more votes for Trump that he's gaining than she's gaining?
[35:06.000 --> 35:15.000]  She's losing 20 plus thousand to Trump and then gaining 700 back.
[35:15.000 --> 35:19.000]  30 plus thousand and the recounts are far from over.
[35:19.000 --> 35:24.000]  Why, they've just begun because they're dragging their feet.
[35:24.000 --> 35:25.000]  Oh, but that's fake news.
[35:25.000 --> 35:35.000]  We shouldn't be showing you the state websites of Michigan and the state websites of Wisconsin and then showing you links directly to the pages.
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.000]  Oh my gosh, such fake news.
[35:37.000 --> 35:46.000]  You go to our news, nine times out of 10, it has neurotic hyperlinks to every claim we make.
[35:46.000 --> 35:48.000]  I say nine times out of 10.
[35:48.000 --> 35:53.000]  A lot of times it's just commentary and it's me sitting there talking and then it's my opinion, my view.
[35:53.000 --> 35:59.000]  But the point is we always go with the best information we have and that's why we have such credibility.
[35:59.000 --> 36:03.000]  They try to cherry pick what we say and do and then use us as a model because we're the biggest.
[36:03.000 --> 36:05.000]  Notice who they're going after.
[36:05.000 --> 36:10.000]  Drudge, Breitbarton and Fullers because if you can shut those down and start curtailing them, it's over.
[36:10.000 --> 36:12.000]  And then they also want to ban the president.
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.000]  Remember, he's got to be kicked off Twitter.
[36:16.000 --> 36:24.000]  The Washington Post, the New York Times, they're all calling for it.
[36:24.000 --> 36:28.000]  Now let's go ahead and go to a clip here.
[36:28.000 --> 36:46.000]  This is of the morning Joe today openly calling for the censorship of the fake news and saying that we have hallucinated the code words that are in pizza gate.
[36:46.000 --> 36:52.000]  And then mainstream media goes further and they say pizza gate is only about ping pong pizza in D.C.
[36:52.000 --> 37:00.000]  And the former boyfriend of David Brock and media matters that runs it and the fact that the Democratic Party has their parties there.
[37:00.000 --> 37:03.000]  And all this weirdness goes on.
[37:03.000 --> 37:09.000]  And even the lawyer that was there when the guy reportedly went in there and shot things, though he didn't see that happen or didn't hear it happen.
[37:09.000 --> 37:16.000]  Even that lawyer goes, yeah, no, I think Podesta is doing some really bad things and these emails are really bad.
[37:16.000 --> 37:22.000]  But then everybody's crazy to be concerned about what's happening in the Podesta emails.
[37:22.000 --> 37:27.000]  You know, it's the Clinton's fault with the Lolita Express and the Epstein pedophile island.
[37:27.000 --> 37:29.000]  It's their fault with Wiener.
[37:29.000 --> 37:31.000]  It's their fault with Clinton and all his sex crimes.
[37:31.000 --> 37:37.000]  It's their fault that it's coming out in the news that the police say there's pedophilia going on.
[37:37.000 --> 37:41.000]  That doesn't mean everybody in the emails is involved or bad.
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  And that's where I've said we should be very, very careful.
[37:43.000 --> 37:48.000]  What does fake news do? They turn around and say that we are the progenitor of it all.
[37:48.000 --> 37:51.000]  Not WikiLeaks, not the people that actually sent the emails.
[37:51.000 --> 37:57.000]  Not all the news that's covered it, not CNN and MSNBC and everybody else that covered Pizza Gate three weeks ago
[37:57.000 --> 38:04.000]  and only made it about ping pong pizza to divert everyone off of the FBI training manuals
[38:04.000 --> 38:12.000]  that show that pedophiles use pizza and other Italian toppings as code words for the type of pedophile stuff they want to do.
[38:12.000 --> 38:17.000]  That's what we covered. That's what we got into.
[38:17.000 --> 38:24.000]  But see, how do you distract away from the weird stuff that's in there?
[38:24.000 --> 38:30.000]  How, oh, you attack Alex Jones as fake news. Let's go to the morning show.
[38:30.000 --> 38:36.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, calling for censorship of fake news, a.k.a. their competition.
[38:36.000 --> 38:42.000]  This is Chinese style net censorship, writ large. It's what desperate organizations do.
[38:42.000 --> 38:49.000]  It's all they can do. But they're not saying, oh, we have a new blacklist like the Communist Chinese do that are advising Facebook
[38:49.000 --> 38:53.000]  and Twitter in the last two years, getting them ready for this. No, no, no, no, no.
[38:53.000 --> 38:56.000]  No, no, it's only fake news. Don't worry.
[38:56.000 --> 39:02.000]  Only fake news that just got the president elected that said he was really ahead in the polls,
[39:02.000 --> 39:07.000]  that said they were giving the questions to Hillary beforehand, that said they were coordinating everything.
[39:07.000 --> 39:18.000]  Oh, and after the clip, I have another new email from WikiLeaks with Podesta telling Comedy Central
[39:18.000 --> 39:23.000]  what questions to ask and what to do to cover up Hillary Clinton's crimes.
[39:23.000 --> 39:29.000]  Every channel, every news show down the line. Let's go to that report. Here it is.
[39:29.000 --> 39:35.000]  It's not hard to stop this fake news if you're Google or if you're Facebook.
[39:35.000 --> 39:39.000]  Hard if you're Twitter. Yeah.
[39:39.000 --> 39:40.000]  Yeah.
[39:40.000 --> 39:44.000]  So this pizzeria story, I won't dignify it by explaining what the conspiracy is,
[39:44.000 --> 39:52.000]  but people saw in the leaked Podesta emails, they hallucinated words meaning something other than what they appeared to mean
[39:52.000 --> 39:58.000]  about some very nefarious things. In other words, they took a pretty innocuous email
[39:58.000 --> 40:03.000]  and thought the words inside that email are code for what's actually happening inside this pizzeria
[40:03.000 --> 40:07.000]  and that grew up in a conspiracy theory and it has real world implications.
[40:07.000 --> 40:12.000]  Again, when a guy walks in because he thinks he's saving children in a pizzeria with an AR-15
[40:12.000 --> 40:17.000]  and fires off a round where families are eating, that's real world stuff.
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  That's not just stuff floating around the internet.
[40:19.000 --> 40:25.000]  And one of the most shocking things to me is you actually have people with college degrees
[40:25.000 --> 40:34.000]  who read these fake news stories and these conspiracy theories and then call all of us up.
[40:34.000 --> 40:35.000]  Is this true?
[40:35.000 --> 40:36.000]  No.
[40:36.000 --> 40:37.000]  Is that true?
[40:37.000 --> 40:38.000]  No.
[40:38.000 --> 40:39.000]  Is that true?
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.000]  You know, after about the 20th, I'm like, no! Stop!
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.000]  You think the Flynn's are doing it knowingly?
[40:44.000 --> 40:45.000]  Oh, stop.
[40:45.000 --> 40:46.000]  Do I think the Flynn's are doing what knowingly?
[40:46.000 --> 40:50.000]  When they retweet the stuff, do they know it's not true and they're just trying to stir up trouble?
[40:50.000 --> 40:53.000]  I think either way is really disturbing.
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  Either way, the answer is disturbing.
[40:55.000 --> 40:56.000]  Yeah.
[40:56.000 --> 40:57.000]  Yeah, disturbing.
[40:57.000 --> 41:00.000]  So, we now get it.
[41:00.000 --> 41:01.000]  What's happening?
[41:01.000 --> 41:05.000]  The discredited lying mainstream media with almost no viewers on these huge sets,
[41:05.000 --> 41:09.000]  losing hundreds of millions of dollars per station per year,
[41:09.000 --> 41:15.000]  are going to sit up there, the same liners that we've seen for years,
[41:15.000 --> 41:18.000]  and tell us it's a lie, it's not true.
[41:18.000 --> 41:23.000]  So, in general, the emails, WikiLeaks, the fact that pedophilia exists at Penn State,
[41:23.000 --> 41:27.000]  or with the UK government, or with the Catholic Church,
[41:27.000 --> 41:30.000]  or with the fact that it's all around us,
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  they're busting giant pedophile networks all the time,
[41:32.000 --> 41:36.000]  and then nothing's being done about it.
[41:36.000 --> 41:39.000]  The whole Barney Frank scandal didn't get in trouble for that.
[41:39.000 --> 41:43.000]  Underage, just 14 years old, runaways,
[41:43.000 --> 41:48.000]  three-story townhome, running a brothel of teenage boys.
[41:48.000 --> 41:49.000]  That was in the news.
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  I suspect they'll come out and say,
[41:51.000 --> 41:55.000]  Alex Jones claims Barney Frank had a bunch of underage teenagers in his house.
[41:55.000 --> 41:57.000]  It was in the frickin' news.
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  He went on C-SPAN, we ought to find the clip,
[41:59.000 --> 42:02.000]  we found the transcript, it was in the New York Times,
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  and said, everybody better drop this right now,
[42:04.000 --> 42:08.000]  or I'm gonna start naming names, leave me alone.
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  So, what's really happening is,
[42:10.000 --> 42:15.000]  they are misrepresenting and making the entire story
[42:15.000 --> 42:18.000]  about the emails, and about WikiLeaks,
[42:18.000 --> 42:20.000]  and about what Podesta was up to,
[42:20.000 --> 42:22.000]  and the Lolita Express, and Epstein,
[42:22.000 --> 42:25.000]  and all the rest of it, and confirmed stuff,
[42:25.000 --> 42:28.000]  and law enforcement sources saying they're using code words
[42:28.000 --> 42:31.000]  and telling the public, look at this, this is serious.
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  And then the FBI manuals from 10 years ago,
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.000]  five years ago, this year,
[42:35.000 --> 42:38.000]  have the exact words in them that we see in these emails,
[42:38.000 --> 42:41.000]  and we say, this needs to be investigated.
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  Maybe it's something innocuous,
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  maybe people also call pizza toppings
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.000]  what kind of drugs you want.
[42:47.000 --> 42:50.000]  It could be drugs, they could be using a pedophile code
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.000]  for other stuff, but it's a pedophile code, okay?
[42:54.000 --> 42:56.000]  It's one used by them.
[42:56.000 --> 43:00.000]  We are hallucinating it, we are insane,
[43:00.000 --> 43:04.000]  we are crazy, we are out of our minds,
[43:04.000 --> 43:08.000]  it's not going on, it's not happening.
[43:08.000 --> 43:10.000]  What are they gonna do when WikiLeaks releases
[43:10.000 --> 43:12.000]  more even hardcore stuff?
[43:12.000 --> 43:14.000]  You're being set up MSM, I hope you know that.
[43:14.000 --> 43:16.000]  And they're so dumb they haven't figured it out yet.
[43:16.000 --> 43:17.000]  Maybe they have, they're like,
[43:17.000 --> 43:19.000]  we gotta shut the internet off now
[43:19.000 --> 43:21.000]  for all the different channels where this can get out
[43:21.000 --> 43:22.000]  with these blacklists.
[43:22.000 --> 43:26.000]  Do you think blacklistinginfullwars.com?
[43:26.000 --> 43:28.000]  Light years worse than what McCarthy did
[43:28.000 --> 43:29.000]  to some Hollywood people.
[43:29.000 --> 43:32.000]  Do you think that's going to be effective?
[43:32.000 --> 43:37.000]  No, that's the final stage that you're completely falling.
[43:37.000 --> 43:38.000]  You think if you blacklist us
[43:38.000 --> 43:40.000]  and WikiLeaks releases more info,
[43:40.000 --> 43:44.000]  it's not gonna get out?
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  You make a black market in news,
[43:46.000 --> 43:48.000]  you'll make us even more powerful.
[43:48.000 --> 43:50.000]  I feel like Obi-Wan Kenobi said to Darth Vader,
[43:50.000 --> 43:52.000]  you can't win, Darth, you strike me down
[43:52.000 --> 43:53.000]  and I'll become more powerful
[43:53.000 --> 43:57.000]  than you can possibly imagine.
[43:57.000 --> 43:59.000]  You just don't get it up in your big
[43:59.000 --> 44:03.000]  historic, arrogant, high-rise studios
[44:03.000 --> 44:04.000]  that you're sitting there
[44:04.000 --> 44:06.000]  and your lies don't work anymore.
[44:06.000 --> 44:08.000]  What happens when it all comes out?
[44:08.000 --> 44:10.000]  The same MSM for decades covered up
[44:10.000 --> 44:12.000]  the pedophile stuff in the Catholic Church.
[44:12.000 --> 44:13.000]  Then once it broke,
[44:13.000 --> 44:16.000]  they were the big champions exposing it.
[44:16.000 --> 44:17.000]  They covered up Penn State.
[44:17.000 --> 44:19.000]  That's hundreds of times worse.
[44:19.000 --> 44:20.000]  He was getting kids for donors.
[44:20.000 --> 44:22.000]  It's come out.
[44:22.000 --> 44:25.000]  Disadvantaged from ages seven up to like 14.
[44:25.000 --> 44:27.000]  Kids that had already been abused.
[44:27.000 --> 44:30.000]  Nobody would believe
[44:30.000 --> 44:32.000]  until he got so brazen,
[44:32.000 --> 44:34.000]  football players would walk in at high noon
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  in the showers in Sandusky
[44:36.000 --> 44:40.000]  would have an eight-year-old bent over.
[44:40.000 --> 44:41.000]  And look at Sandusky.
[44:41.000 --> 44:43.000]  And we put Sandusky on screen for TV viewers
[44:43.000 --> 44:45.000]  and then put Jimmy Savelle up there.
[44:45.000 --> 44:47.000]  I mean, I don't judge a book by its cover,
[44:47.000 --> 44:49.000]  but when you talk about pedophiles, folks,
[44:49.000 --> 44:51.000]  they are somebody you'd walk
[44:51.000 --> 44:53.000]  to the other side of the street if you saw them.
[44:53.000 --> 44:56.000]  They have a weird, like, demon-hungry,
[44:56.000 --> 44:57.000]  little demon smile.
[44:57.000 --> 44:59.000]  They're always real wimpy.
[44:59.000 --> 45:02.000]  There was, like, demonic chipmunks.
[45:02.000 --> 45:04.000]  Now, look at Sandusky.
[45:04.000 --> 45:09.000]  Now, let's put up another evil chipmunk.
[45:09.000 --> 45:11.000]  Let's go ahead and put up Jimmy Savelle,
[45:11.000 --> 45:14.000]  who supplied children reportedly to the royal family.
[45:14.000 --> 45:17.000]  Look at that guy, boy.
[45:17.000 --> 45:18.000]  Whoo!
[45:18.000 --> 45:21.000]  You want to walk the other side of the street with that.
[45:21.000 --> 45:23.000]  Imagine being a six-year-old girl
[45:23.000 --> 45:24.000]  and that walks through the door.
[45:24.000 --> 45:26.000]  It's time to die.
[45:26.000 --> 45:28.000]  He didn't just rape them, folks.
[45:28.000 --> 45:31.000]  He slit those little throats while he raped them.
[45:31.000 --> 45:33.000]  Good God.
[45:33.000 --> 45:37.000]  Scroll down.
[45:37.000 --> 45:39.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen,
[45:39.000 --> 45:42.000]  ladies and gentlemen, you want to talk about a pedo, baby.
[45:42.000 --> 45:43.000]  There's one.
[45:43.000 --> 45:46.000]  Oh, but MSNBC says,
[45:46.000 --> 45:48.000]  in CNBC,
[45:48.000 --> 45:50.000]  the morning Joe.
[45:50.000 --> 45:52.000]  Oh, the morning Joe, Joe Scarborough.
[45:52.000 --> 45:55.000]  Is that fake news you were found, a dead intern,
[45:55.000 --> 45:57.000]  an attractive young intern, female intern,
[45:57.000 --> 46:01.000]  was found dead in your office, strangled?
[46:01.000 --> 46:06.000]  Oh, I mean, was a dead intern found in your office, bro?
[46:06.000 --> 46:09.000]  Oh, and I'm just saying, and where are you today, Jack?
[46:09.000 --> 46:11.000]  Oh, is that fake news that a young female
[46:11.000 --> 46:13.000]  was found dead in your office?
[46:13.000 --> 46:19.000]  There are no dead females found around here?
[46:19.000 --> 46:22.000]  Well, wild night, I might go bowling and drink a beer.
[46:22.000 --> 46:24.000]  I won't even drink anymore.
[46:24.000 --> 46:25.000]  He told me.
[46:25.000 --> 46:32.000]  But wild night, for me, is a beer and bowling, Joe.
[46:32.000 --> 46:33.000]  Okay.
[46:33.000 --> 46:35.000]  But you're the type of man they want to promote.
[46:35.000 --> 46:37.000]  You're the type of man going places.
[46:37.000 --> 46:38.000]  I get it.
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.000]  I get it, sweetheart.
[46:40.000 --> 46:42.000]  I get it.
[46:42.000 --> 46:43.000]  So I'm going to get more into this here in a moment
[46:43.000 --> 46:45.000]  than back in the really positive news and the Trump effect.
[46:45.000 --> 46:47.000]  Before we go any further,
[46:47.000 --> 46:49.000]  I'm going to tell everybody something right now.
[46:49.000 --> 46:51.000]  We don't make any money selling Hillary
[46:51.000 --> 46:53.000]  for prison 2017 shirts with George Charles
[46:53.000 --> 46:54.000]  in the back as a goblin.
[46:54.000 --> 46:57.000]  But we are selling a ton of them, so thank you for that.
[46:57.000 --> 46:59.000]  But let me tell you, making six, seven, eight bucks on a shirt
[46:59.000 --> 47:01.000]  doesn't make this Murray go around, go around.
[47:01.000 --> 47:05.000]  We need to bring in some serious hard gold cash in this fight.
[47:05.000 --> 47:07.000]  I need to get five, six, seven more reporters.
[47:07.000 --> 47:08.000]  I need to get more crew members.
[47:08.000 --> 47:11.000]  I need to get more writers, more researchers, fact checkers.
[47:11.000 --> 47:12.000]  You name it.
[47:12.000 --> 47:15.000]  We've actually got to get into a more editorial perspective here
[47:15.000 --> 47:18.000]  because we go with basic analysis and research and info
[47:18.000 --> 47:20.000]  and generally off other reporting.
[47:20.000 --> 47:22.000]  But I want to go even next level.
[47:22.000 --> 47:23.000]  And I need funds.
[47:23.000 --> 47:26.000]  And look, people say they want to fight the New World Order.
[47:26.000 --> 47:32.000]  Well, baby, there ain't nowhere you can spend your money
[47:32.000 --> 47:35.000]  and know that it is doing one-tenth of what we do.
[47:35.000 --> 47:37.000]  I'm sorry, it's just a fact.
[47:37.000 --> 47:40.000]  Infowarsstore.com says to port Charles
[47:40.000 --> 47:42.000]  in the back, Infowars established in 1996.
[47:42.000 --> 47:45.000]  On the front, it says, Hillary for Prison, 2017,
[47:45.000 --> 47:46.000]  limited edition.
[47:46.000 --> 47:52.000]  And then on the right-hand shoulder, Infowars.com.
[47:52.000 --> 47:53.000]  Get the shirt.
[47:53.000 --> 47:54.000]  Be aggressive.
[47:54.000 --> 47:55.000]  Get it out there.
[47:55.000 --> 47:56.000]  Meet like-minded people.
[47:56.000 --> 47:59.000]  Now, to support the broadcast, let me tell you something.
[47:59.000 --> 48:02.000]  If you don't try DNA force that is documented
[48:02.000 --> 48:06.000]  with 175 clinical studies with just the BioPQQ,
[48:06.000 --> 48:08.000]  and there's so many fake BioPQQs out there.
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  This is certified from Mitsubishi America.
[48:10.000 --> 48:15.000]  It's been proven to deoxify, to take toxins out of the cells,
[48:15.000 --> 48:18.000]  to nerve growth factor, energize, and more.
[48:18.000 --> 48:19.000]  Just go read about it.
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.000]  That's one ingredient, DNA force.
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.000]  It would cost you three to four times this
[48:23.000 --> 48:24.000]  to get it from a doctor.
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  This stuff is not sold in stores.
[48:26.000 --> 48:28.000]  DNA force is not prescription, but it is in Europe.
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  We're trying to make some of this prescription.
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.000]  So, BioPQQ, get it today.
[48:32.000 --> 48:36.000]  It's 25% off InfowarsLife.com is the subsection

[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  Triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  Whether it's high-quality, swarable foods,
[48:44.000 --> 48:45.000]  you can be self-sufficient,
[48:45.000 --> 48:48.000]  or really great solar generator systems,
[48:48.000 --> 48:51.000]  or great mini systems to charge your cell phones
[48:51.000 --> 48:54.000]  and jump your car, or lightning in a bottle,
[48:54.000 --> 48:57.000]  vitamin B12, in secret 12.
[48:57.000 --> 48:58.000]  It's all there.
[48:58.000 --> 49:01.000]  The all-new brain force with 20% more, more caplets,
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.000]  powdered caplets, absorb better in each bottle,
[49:04.000 --> 49:07.000]  and it's a stronger or concentrated version
[49:07.000 --> 49:08.000]  with no fillers.
[49:08.000 --> 49:09.000]  Didn't have fillers before.
[49:09.000 --> 49:12.000]  We've just found some even more energized sources.
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  We're always upgrading, always doing it.
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  InfowarsLife.com or call toll-free,
[49:16.000 --> 49:20.000]  eight, eight, eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[49:20.000 --> 49:24.000]  But the number one thing you can do is pray for us.
[49:24.000 --> 49:25.000]  I'm praying for you.
[49:25.000 --> 49:26.000]  Pray for enlightenment.
[49:26.000 --> 49:27.000]  Pray for awakening.
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.000]  Pray for hedge of protection around those of us
[49:29.000 --> 49:30.000]  trying to battle evil.
[49:30.000 --> 49:33.000]  Please deliver us from the enemy's snares and darts
[49:33.000 --> 49:36.000]  and take our articles, take our videos,
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  and post them on Facebook, Twitter.
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  Put them out everywhere.
[49:40.000 --> 49:43.000]  Try different stuff in the info or change names.
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  Put our videos on your site.
[49:45.000 --> 49:48.000]  Give them a name like French Bulldogs to beat their AI.
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  And then watch it get 5 million views.
[49:50.000 --> 49:52.000]  We've been doing a lot of testing around here.
[49:52.000 --> 49:53.000]  But here's the deal.
[49:53.000 --> 49:56.000]  They don't want to embarrass themselves and censor us openly,
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  but despite all the covert censorship,
[49:58.000 --> 50:01.000]  we went from 28 million a week listening and viewing
[50:01.000 --> 50:04.000]  before the election to 85 million a week at the election.
[50:04.000 --> 50:10.000]  And our new floor, our new low, is 40 mil, 40 and a half,
[50:10.000 --> 50:13.000]  40 and some change.
[50:13.000 --> 50:16.000]  But they want us kicked out of the big Google system
[50:16.000 --> 50:17.000]  where we can see what we're doing.
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  That gives us targeting.
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  Let me tell you, it gives us targeting.
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  It gives us like a canopy in an airplane
[50:23.000 --> 50:26.000]  so you can actually see what you're doing.
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  And let me tell you, we're devastating the enemy.
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.000]  You're devastating the enemy, so keep it up.
[50:30.000 --> 50:31.000]  They want to de-list us.
[50:31.000 --> 50:34.000]  They want to just suddenly not be able to hear from us
[50:34.000 --> 50:37.000]  if you are over in Europe.
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  And we've got some guerrilla tactics to counter this,
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  but this shows how much trouble the EU's in
[50:41.000 --> 50:44.000]  that the EU said covertly two years ago, they now admit,
[50:44.000 --> 50:48.000]  oh, you're going to try to leave us, Spain or Italy or others?
[50:48.000 --> 50:51.000]  We have a new EU army that is going to march in
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  and quote, take control of your military.
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  That's called an invasion,
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  but the bureaucrats will open the door
[50:57.000 --> 50:58.000]  and act like it's no big deal.
[50:58.000 --> 51:00.000]  It's a covert takeover.
[51:00.000 --> 51:03.000]  I want to tell you about a brand new off-the-grid product.
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  It's a pocket-sized solar generator.
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  Even though it's so small you can put it in your pocket,
[51:07.000 --> 51:10.000]  it can actually run some 110 appliances at your house,
[51:10.000 --> 51:13.000]  like small refrigerators to keep your food from spoiling.
[51:13.000 --> 51:16.000]  The best part, though, you can take it with you.
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  It's mobile to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses,
[51:18.000 --> 51:21.000]  18-wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  The new PPX system provides
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.000]  an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity,
[51:25.000 --> 51:28.000]  basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[51:28.000 --> 51:29.000]  A true innovation.
[51:29.000 --> 51:31.000]  I have never seen anything like this.
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.000]  You're going to want to load up on these.
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  It's even a great Christmas idea
[51:37.000 --> 51:39.000]  if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid.
[51:39.000 --> 51:41.000]  Go to privatepowergrid.com.

[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  There is an affordable alternative
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  to the high cost of healthcare that offers
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.000]  freedom from insurance while providing compliance
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  with the Obamacare individual mandate.
[52:37.000 --> 52:40.000]  Imagine having access to quality, affordable healthcare
[52:40.000 --> 52:43.000]  that allows you the freedom to choose your doctor and hospital.
[52:43.000 --> 52:47.000]  Members can share up to 100% of necessary medical expenses,

[53:26.000 --> 53:29.000]  Go Berkey.com.
[53:56.000 --> 54:01.000]  You know, we've got Joe Gilbert coming in studio in the next hour.
[54:01.000 --> 54:05.000]  He's here in Austin, the filmmaker,
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  really one of the MVPs of the election,
[54:07.000 --> 54:08.000]  exposing the globalists.
[54:08.000 --> 54:10.000]  And he's got new breaking news.
[54:10.000 --> 54:13.000]  He went to the same maximum security prison
[54:13.000 --> 54:17.000]  that Mr. Helper said,
[54:17.000 --> 54:30.000]  he's held in Charlie Manson and talked to one of Obama's best friends
[54:30.000 --> 54:33.000]  who certified to be one of his longtime best friends.
[54:33.000 --> 54:34.000]  He told him everything.
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  Gilbert's really an expert at getting original research.
[54:36.000 --> 54:38.000]  Talk about an investigative journalist.
[54:38.000 --> 54:41.000]  When and how Obama found out communist Frank Marshall Davis
[54:41.000 --> 54:44.000]  was his real father, this is confirming this.
[54:44.000 --> 54:47.000]  Obama's racist views growing up,
[54:47.000 --> 54:50.000]  how communist Frank Marshall Davis radicalized Obama
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  during his youth over drugs, alcohol,
[54:52.000 --> 54:55.000]  and visits to strip clubs.
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  This and more is coming up.
[54:57.000 --> 54:58.000]  I'm not going to tell you everything
[54:58.000 --> 54:59.000]  because he's going to break it down.
[54:59.000 --> 55:00.000]  This is big.
[55:00.000 --> 55:01.000]  This is coming up.
[55:01.000 --> 55:05.000]  I should have been plugging this from the very start.
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  Joe Gilbert.net is his website.
[55:07.000 --> 55:10.000]  He helped also get the Danny Williams story out
[55:10.000 --> 55:14.000]  and ended up getting over 50 million views conservatively
[55:14.000 --> 55:17.000]  and really helped in the urban demographic
[55:17.000 --> 55:21.000]  turn the tide against Obama.
[55:21.000 --> 55:25.000]  So we were, and of course Hillary Clinton in the election.
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  Now I've got a lot of other clips I want to get to.
[55:27.000 --> 55:32.000]  The really exciting news is in two different states
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  where they started the recount,
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  the first stage to give us numbers,
[55:36.000 --> 55:40.000]  Trump has picked up 33,000 more, Hillary,
[55:40.000 --> 55:43.000]  not even 2,000 in Wisconsin.
[55:43.000 --> 55:44.000]  He's picked up 22,000.
[55:44.000 --> 55:46.000]  She's picked up 1,700.
[55:46.000 --> 55:50.000]  So she's lost over 20,000 and gained 1,700.
[55:50.000 --> 55:54.000]  Trump has gained 22,000 in Michigan
[55:54.000 --> 55:57.000]  and 32,000 in Wisconsin.
[55:57.000 --> 56:00.000]  Update, Trump up by 22,000 votes in Wisconsin recount.
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  We also have the Michigan too.
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  And again, folks, I've got all these numbers in front of me.
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  I'm teleprompter free.
[56:06.000 --> 56:08.000]  They're all just dancing around in my head,
[56:08.000 --> 56:09.000]  making my head spin.
[56:09.000 --> 56:12.000]  But last time I checked it was 22,000 in Michigan.
[56:12.000 --> 56:15.000]  There was also Wisconsin and a lot more.
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  But a lot of exciting things are going on.
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  A lot of exciting things are happening.
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  I also had Rob doing here with his cracked iPhone screen going,
[56:21.000 --> 56:24.000]  look, see, see those, it's more than 17,000.
[56:24.000 --> 56:27.000]  Here's Wisconsin and here's Michigan and my head spinning.
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  Just go read the article on infowars.com.
[56:29.000 --> 56:32.000]  It's very, very important information.
[56:32.000 --> 56:36.000]  Now, speaking of fake news,
[56:36.000 --> 56:39.000]  this is some of the latest from WikiLeaks.org.
[56:39.000 --> 56:43.000]  It's from 2013.
[56:43.000 --> 56:44.000]  And it's John.
[56:44.000 --> 56:47.000]  I hope you got the chance to see the Colbert reports.
[56:47.000 --> 56:48.000]  Two special episodes.
[56:48.000 --> 56:51.000]  I had them do a CGI,
[56:51.000 --> 56:54.000]  you that we taped in St. Louis that weekend.
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  This is the link to last night's,
[56:56.000 --> 56:59.000]  with a sketch about commitments and monologue
[56:59.000 --> 57:02.000]  with WJC interview aired Monday.
[57:02.000 --> 57:07.000]  Hope you enjoy looking forward.
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  And then it goes on to your feedback.
[57:09.000 --> 57:13.000]  Next will be your Colbert appearance.
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  That's ColbertNation.com.
[57:15.000 --> 57:20.000]  And that's them with John Podesta telling him
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.000]  how they're choreographing everything for Hillary,
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.000]  dealing with her college.
[57:25.000 --> 57:29.000]  The fact that the Clinton's college was a million times worse
[57:29.000 --> 57:33.000]  than any problems that Trump's college may have had.
[57:33.000 --> 57:37.000]  So the Colbert report, special episodes,
[57:37.000 --> 57:42.000]  that was the title of it.
[57:42.000 --> 57:46.000]  That's what they're doing is every major media outlet
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.000]  coordinating, scripting it.
[57:48.000 --> 57:50.000]  You don't need to know that when Obama goes on,
[57:50.000 --> 57:54.000]  Jimmy Fallon live and has subscripted piece,
[57:54.000 --> 57:58.000]  riffing off of jazz.
[57:58.000 --> 57:59.000]  And it's all perfectly done.
[57:59.000 --> 58:01.000]  It's all choreographed.
[58:01.000 --> 58:03.000]  And they're choreographing things.
[58:03.000 --> 58:05.000]  It's disgusting.
[58:05.000 --> 58:06.000]  They are the fake news.
[58:06.000 --> 58:08.000]  They are the establishment, the septicon news,
[58:08.000 --> 58:10.000]  trying to keep control of the economy,
[58:10.000 --> 58:12.000]  trying to make sure they run the whole show,
[58:12.000 --> 58:15.000]  trying to keep you poor so they control you.
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  That's why it's important to take it personal
[58:17.000 --> 58:20.000]  and realize this is a war against foreign multinationals
[58:20.000 --> 58:23.000]  of hijacked the country, act accordingly.
[58:23.000 --> 58:25.000]  Do everything in your power that's nonviolent
[58:25.000 --> 58:29.000]  to expose these monsters and to speak out against them
[58:29.000 --> 58:30.000]  and to take action.
[58:30.000 --> 58:34.000]  All right, second hour, only 70 seconds away,
[58:34.000 --> 58:57.000]  so much to cover, stay with us.
[59:04.000 --> 59:06.000]  All right, the next morning,
[59:06.000 --> 59:07.600]  we're just going to talk about
[59:07.600 --> 59:10.000]  the super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[59:10.000 --> 59:12.000]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential
[59:12.000 --> 59:14.000]  to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[59:14.000 --> 59:17.000]  The reality is it's hard to take in the proper amount
[59:17.000 --> 59:20.000]  of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.

[59:25.000 --> 59:27.000]  and support your body's natural systems.
[59:27.000 --> 59:29.000]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12
[59:29.000 --> 59:32.000]  into one explosive formula.
[59:32.000 --> 59:36.560]  blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with

[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:35.560]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central. I'm your host Alex Jones. An incredible
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:40.840]  time to be alive. Corporate media has been exposed to shills as fake news. Their answer
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:46.920]  from Europe to the United States is to join China and blacklist all nationalist pro-freedom,
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:51.720]  pro-gun, pro-religious freedom organizations. They're telling our kids don't give out Christmas
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:55.160]  cards at school. That's their free speech to do that. They're telling them separation
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:58.240]  of church and state. Separation of church and state means we don't have a government
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:03.480]  state run religion. But if local governments want to put up a Christmas display they can,
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:09.160]  but certainly your kids can hand out Christmas cards. This is all part of the intimidation,
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:15.040]  all part of the control. Oh, your school can have a Satan club, but you can't have a Christian
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:18.600]  club because it means separation of church and state. Oh, your school can have a Muslim
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:24.520]  club, but you can't have a Christian club. This is pure discrimination. People have to
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:29.720]  tell the different leftist organizations like People for the American Way, you know, headed
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:39.520]  up by Kramer and all his exploits. Go back to Hades from which they came. Get behind
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:48.040]  me, Beelzebub, and all your pumps, and all your pimps, and all your other angler fish
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:54.960]  swimming along behind you. Now, Joe Gilbert's got big breaking news on Obama coming up and
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.640]  saying, well, why don't we hear about Obama? It's important to destroy his legacy, expose
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:03.320]  what a shell he is, just as Hillary, and to bring them both to justice. Nobody's above
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:07.520]  the law. I don't care if they're the president. I don't care who they are. We've got to hold
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:13.280]  them to that. So that's coming up. And then I'm also going to get into this. I mean, I
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:18.680]  see this every day, but today there's like five articles. We're all over the country.
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:21.480]  People with Trump signs are having their houses burned down. They're being assaulted. They're
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:26.960]  being killed, especially if they're white. And the media, we've got CNN clubs going,
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:29.880]  well, they're white, big dealer. Cops are getting killed. Well, it's their fault because
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:37.360]  cops did bad stuff. How have a cop done something bad in another state? Is it now their fault?
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:45.920]  Why does a black cop getting shot in Dallas, or a black cop being shot in Baton Rouge? Because
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:50.760]  somebody thinks a cop did something bad somewhere else. How is that justice? You know, in Black
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:56.080]  Lives Matter, pushes bang, bang, you know, you're dead pig, or decked the halls with
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:01.800]  dead cops, and then cops get killed. Oh, then it's their free speech. It's not their fault
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:07.920]  calling for violence. Then I'm not calling for violence. I cover mainstream media covering
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:13.600]  pizza gate and say, boy, this does look suspicious. And then they have some actor and it is true.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:18.360]  It's an actor come in there and then no witnesses say shots are fired, but the news say shots
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:24.200]  are fired. It turns out the supposed actor ran over a little girl this year, but no charges
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:28.600]  happened. And then magically, his dad owns a production company, and then magically he
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:33.320]  goes in and does this. And magically, then of course, he's an Alex Jones listener, of
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:38.840]  course. And then magically, I've got to be blamed for it. So does the free press, right?
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:44.280]  As they try to quote ban independent media. Good luck banning us and good luck blaming
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:49.400]  us for what's going on. It's not going to work. It's like a whack-a-mole. You're only certifying
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:57.440]  us into the age of wonder. You're only making us legends now. So please continue report buried
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:02.080]  Trump related hate crimes against white kids. New York Post, we're going to cover that.
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:08.200]  German state media refuses to run migrant murder story. Say it's too regional. Show the migrants
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:13.800]  killed another German woman. Better believe it was some white guys killed a Muslim woman.
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:17.880]  It would be never be the end of it. And this isn't about hating Muslims. It's about the
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:24.960]  left being one sided covering up for Muslims and Muslim leaders saying, we're taking your
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:29.000]  country over. It's ours. You're weak. We're going to put you under Sharia law. And it's
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:36.480]  not some little side E-moms doing this. It's the dominant predominant E-mom of Jerusalem.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:44.480]  You name it. I mean, it's outrageous troops. Trump supporter has his truck torched and spray
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:49.800]  with anti-Trump slogans while at Christmas party and other articles. It's all coming
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:56.600]  up straight ahead with Joel Gilbert in studio. I'm Alex Jones, info wars.com is the evil,
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:00.280]  horrible website.
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:05.840]  The web giants at YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft have announced that they are
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:12.840]  stepping up efforts to remove extremist content from the internet as the EU demands social
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:19.880]  media websites censor fake news within 24 hours. Meanwhile, the fake news controversy
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:25.880]  is being exploited by the mainstream media to characterize completely legitimate alternative
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:32.640]  news sources. For example, CBS News just listed info wars as a fake news website. And that's
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:37.920]  because the mainstream establishment media is losing all credibility with the American
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:43.400]  people. And it was alternative and social media who helped Donald Trump win the presidential
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:49.520]  election. So now the globalist battle plan is to indoctrinate the masses into only accepting
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:55.080]  the establishment viewpoint of what they want you to believe is real news. You can learn
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:57.600]  more right now at info wars.com.
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:10.360]  You ever wonder what happened to America? Something's wrong. We all know it. I'm Charity
[01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:15.320]  Daniels and I'm here to tell you about it. The nation has been hijacked by international
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:22.160]  forces bent on global governance. When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag,
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:31.040]  heritage, mom and apple pie. God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:36.800]  Revelation, dawn of global government. We're the solution. Americans ain't nothing more
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:37.800]  to it than that.
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:43.440]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin, theatrical
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:49.440]  screenings on demand, DVDs now available, on the sheds and tears of the red, white,
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:58.600]  blue, revelation, the movie.info. Americans needn't see this film. Revelation, the movie.info.
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:06:59.760]  Let's fix it.

[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:26.960]  There have been thousands of incredible editorial cartoons in the last year and a half during
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:36.120]  this historic general election that has shaken globalism to its foundations. But one in particular,
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:44.720]  and I can't even read who created it, something that's SV Mears created one that tells it all.
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:54.160]  It's an image of Donald Trump, and he is basically out on a football field. We'll show TV viewers
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:09:03.640]  a shot of that. And he's throwing the football over a TV crew and a newspaper writer to a
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:10.760]  fellow sitting on his couch, and he's getting his information to the voter via social media.
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:17.160]  It's very simple, but it tells it all. The gatekeepers are now not in the middle. And
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:21.280]  what is social media? It's what you think. It's what's being said. It's raw videos.
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:26.520]  It's raw articles. It's filmmakers. It's foreign press. It's government documents. It's pieces
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:33.200]  of legislation. It's white papers. It's excerpts of books written by the globalists in many
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:37.960]  cases, admitting world government, admitting they want communism for the general public,
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:43.360]  admitting how much they hate us. And so now things that were only meant for the elite,
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:47.080]  they love to brag to themselves in these books they write, and white papers is now being
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:53.120]  seen by the public. And Donald J. Trump has thrown the ball right over their heads. I
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:58.120]  have retweeted this image out at Real Alex Jones. I believe this is the most powerful
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:05.600]  editorial cartoon of 2016. Ben Garrison's awesome. Anthony Frida are amazing. But I
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:11.200]  think this encapsulates it all. In fact, you know, the most sincere form of flattery is
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:14.440]  imitation. I'd love to see what have been Garrison did with this. I bet he'd make it
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:20.200]  even better for an Anthony Frida. In fact, maybe we should have a contest for $5,000
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:26.120]  because art is culture is the future. Make art to defeat tyranny. Make art individual
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:30.400]  art to defeat the collectivist. I think we should probably codify and have a contest
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:34.680]  that we announced the next few days for people taking basically this iconic image. We should
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:38.080]  have the cartoonist on. Don't even know their name. Just saw it yesterday and just printed
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:45.640]  it off today. And take this image and then duplicate it thousands and thousands of times.
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:51.080]  Even if you don't win, you win by resisting the globalists. So what are they going to
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:55.440]  do now? If you're a radio listener, again, go to my Twitter, Real Alex Jones, you can
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:58.660]  see it on the post on info wars.com. What are they going to do? Well, we told you Matt
[01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:03.480]  Dredge was here. What was it 13 months ago? They said, Alex, I'm giving you this exclusive
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:07.640]  interview, the first interview in three years because I was visited by Supreme Court Justice.
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:10.720]  I know I keep hammering on this. He said, next year they're going to come in with the
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:16.120]  EU and the UN and start trying to censor the web. And it's so bad. I talked about this
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:22.000]  last hour. I didn't even convey to you how bad it was. It's so sensational. And he said,
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.720]  they're going to hand over the web to the internationals. It's all going to happen.
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:29.400]  The Supreme Court Justice told me he should just sit down and shut up. That's not that
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:32.760]  Matt should sit down and shut up. The Supreme Court Justice was told, sit down and shut
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:36.360]  up conservatives because it's over. We're going to do this. We've got the votes, but
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:42.440]  they didn't get Hillary in. They didn't get what they wanted. Have they stopped? No. They're
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:49.000]  so arrogant that they still handed the internet over to this international consortium headed
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.920]  up by the UN with the Saudi Arabians heading up the human rights council that is part of
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:12:01.360]  the decision-making process. And now the EU came out yesterday and said, you have 24 hours
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:06.320]  Google, Facebook, Twitter, and over a hundred other sites to ban Breitbart, Info Wars and
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:13.400]  Rudge Report. We're listed. So people can't even get to it. And no one's allowed to post
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:17.440]  it. Talk about blacklist a thousand times worse than what we were told about McCarthy
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:23.040]  that wasn't even true. This is incredible. This is what comes after the MSM dies. We're
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:26.400]  going to cover this summer's hour and talk about it with us 30 minutes to the next hour.
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:30.800]  It's been plenty of time. The bottom of the argument that he is huge breaking Obama news.
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:35.240]  I'm going to tell you about in a moment as well, but they've consulted with the communist
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:39.680]  Chinese, the EU has, Facebook has, Obama has. He's come out and said, we need state-run
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:45.480]  media. Obama gave three speeches or more than I saw, saw three of them in Greece, in Germany,
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:50.120]  saying time to censor, time to have state-run media. He told Rolling Stone that as well.
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:54.800]  And now we learn before Trump even gets in, they want to do this. And the Washington Post
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:13:00.520]  is saying, we need to censor Trump. And Twitter responded last week and said, yes, we're considering
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:06.200]  banning the president saying he's a bully. So this is an attempted media coup by dying
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:12.560]  media with the billionaire Silicon Valley globalist to shut us down because we're hurting
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:17.160]  them so badly. They lied in the polls. They lied about the debates. They got caught consorting
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:22.280]  with, you know, running all the major mainstream media from the daily show to CBS news. And
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:26.440]  their answer is to call us fake news and come in and try to shut us down. And now they're
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:32.680]  announcing it 44 days before Trump gets in. Now you have huge news coming up, Joe Gilbert
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:36.160]  at the bottom of the hour. Everybody's got to tune in for this because we've got exposed
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:40.920]  who Obama is and why he did what he did. Joe Gilbert has gone and talked to one of his
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:46.880]  known best friends on record at his maximum security prison. When and how Obama found
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:51.160]  out his communist father was Frank Marshall Davis. Obama's racist views growing up how
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:58.720]  communist Frank Marshall Davis radicalized Obama with drugs and topless bars and so much
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:03.000]  more. Wait till you hear this. He'll also reveal what he learned about Obama's Connecticut
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.200]  social security number. This is a true investigative journalist, folks. He's interviewed Malik Obama.
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:11.080]  He's interviewed. He went and exposed just other the Frank Marshall Davis was his real
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:16.600]  dad, which has now come out. He's also going to release so much more here today. So he's
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:20.640]  with us in 30 minutes to the next hour. Then I'll open the phones up for the last 30 minutes
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:26.000]  of the show I'm hosting. And then we're going to have Paul Watson from London, England with
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:31.320]  Big News on the whole fake news front. But the articles on info wars.com. And quite frankly,
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:36.240]  Paul's article isn't even hardcore enough. The headline should be after the hand of
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:41.000]  the web over the internet censorship of all nationalistic or conservative sites announced.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:47.960]  I mean, this is bomb shell. And they have CBS News saying we should be shut down yesterday
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:54.560]  calling him for his fake news. We have the Morning Joe saying, quote, it's that we hallucinated
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:58.600]  what was in the WikiLeaks about sex traffic, even though it's in there. We're not saying
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:02.400]  everything in their sex. It was definitely there is what the FBI saying. I mean, look
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:07.360]  at the pedophile island. You'll look at Lolita Express. Look at Epstein. Look at Clinton.
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:11.160]  I mean, this is this is incredible. Look at the Penn State. I mean, it's just look at
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:16.160]  the Catholic church. This is how the leftist takeover organizations is with their sex exploitation.
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:21.200]  That's how spies operate. But cheating on your wife now won't get you in prison, folks.
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:25.640]  So it's got to be pedophilia. Gay isn't enough now. That's why they use these cults to do
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:30.440]  it. This is incredible. So this is all coming up. But we're two minutes to midnight here.
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:34.480]  And I want to talk to Joel Gilbert about what he thinks about this, how we counter this.
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:38.920]  I tell you, this is really a toothless attack because no one believes them. No one likes
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:44.120]  them. Maybe 30% of the public. So does it? These are just the cherry on top. Like they've
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:47.360]  dug their grave. Now they're climbing into it, shoveling dirt on themselves. Or am I
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:51.440]  wrong? Joel Gilbert, filmmaker, investigative journalist. Thanks for being there.
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:53.160]  Thank you. Good to see you finally. Alex, how are you?
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:58.880]  Good to have you here in person. All right. Well, look, the leftist revolution was always
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:03.080]  a long term revolution. Obama's election was not a sudden political phenomenon. It really
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:09.360]  was the result of this American socialist movement that took over the universities, journalism,
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:14.400]  and red diaper doper babies. Yeah, for decades. So they see this as a long term effort. Barack
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:17.720]  Obama was never interested in being president in the United States. He was only interested
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:25.800]  in using the presidency to agitate and to try to divide the country and help for meant
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:30.480]  this long term revolution. So I think we're still in a period of great danger despite
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:36.800]  Trump's being elected. Obama is planning, still a very young man relatively, is planning
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:41.640]  to remain the head of the Democrat Party and help organize and agitate for the next four
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:47.480]  years. He's given a lot of indications that he has every plan to use that position to
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:51.640]  say things he couldn't say as if he hasn't said and they're not giving up. They're digging
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:55.040]  in. They're talking about his own TV network now. Right. And of course, those just shut
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:17:01.600]  us off and make us watch him. Correct. So look, what did Ronald Reagan really accomplish
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:07.640]  if within eight 16 years, Barack Obama takes over, opens the borders, loads the Supreme
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:14.480]  Court with leftist politicians, Obamacare. So the danger is that Trump has to succeed
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:20.440]  and create such a system and purge the left from all the government institutions, whether
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:27.160]  it be the National Council on Arts and Humanities, the funding of all these radical organizations.
[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:32.360]  It has to be purged of everything Obama has done to stack the system. And you can see
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:36.360]  him trying to put the final touches on the internet. And that's why it's important we're
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:40.160]  going to break down who he really is because he's not going away like Bill Clinton. He's
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:43.680]  going to stay around even worse than ever. But specifically, until the bottom of the
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:48.720]  hour, I'm going to get into all this with you. What do you make of them openly starting
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:54.200]  to censor info wars? I mean, it's begun starting to censor Breitbart. It started.
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:18:00.480]  This is a continuation of the radical leftist agenda because they know that middle America,
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:05.880]  the church going hardworking people will never buy into this progressive nonsense. Even in
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:10.640]  my film, there's no place like utopia. I talked to black people living in urban America. They
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:16.720]  didn't want any part of transgenderism. They didn't want to these mothers of black kids
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:20.880]  did not want their kids smoking marijuana being legalized. They didn't want illegal immigrants
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:26.600]  coming into the neighborhoods. The only way they can control us is through the media and
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:31.960]  through complete control of the Supreme Court and the tools of power, the tools of state.
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:37.040]  So the America will never buy into this nonsense. So this is their last gasp effort. And if
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:40.640]  they can succeed at this, it'll it'll and if they don't succeed, they'll just come back
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:46.480]  with another plan. They'll never go away. It's incredibly naked. It's incredibly brazen
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:51.240]  to just openly say we're going to list you as fake news when they're the discredited
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:57.200]  fake news that should be closing their doors. Look, they've tried so many outrageous things
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:04.480]  that were never stopped. The IRS scandal using credible persecution, credible persecution,
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:10.360]  the fast and furious using the, you know, running guns through Mexico and getting a
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:17.880]  U.S. DA agent to Al Qaeda. We now learn, you know, running guns from Al Qaeda in Libya
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:24.080]  to Al Qaeda in Syria through Turkey, nothing, no matter how outrageous the Obama administration
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:27.440]  is now come out. I'm sure you know this, that it was actually running, not just to blame
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:31.120]  the Second Amendment, a CBS learned that they fired the reporter, Actonson. They were running
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:36.360]  the guns into Mexico and a lot of them then over to Libya and then exactly. Yeah, there's
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:40.560]  no end of it, but no one ever, the media never stood up. The Republicans never stood up to
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:46.800]  the left. My hope is that Trump and people like yourself can finally get it out. And
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:51.760]  I think it has succeeded in that middle America realizes what a scam leftism and progressivism.
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:55.520]  That's right. Let's come back and talk about General Flynn's son is also under attack right
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:20:01.000]  now for exposing all this. This is key. Try to have a Joe Gilbert.

[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:04.440]  Hi, my name is Stephen Holstein. In my 20s, I abused stimulant and anabolic steroids at
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:08.400]  the point where my adrenal glands were shot. I suffered from extreme fatigue and an inability
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:13.080]  to handle stress. For over six years, I had been taking adrenal supplements including herbs,
[01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:18.360]  glandulars, vitamin C, and vitamin B5. All these supplements did was treat the symptoms
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:23.440]  and produced only minimal results. Now, just after one month on Synergy One and Adiometics,
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:29.240]  I truly feel rejuvenated. I have never felt such relaxation before from any adrenal supplement
[01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:34.440]  as I did just 10 minutes after taking Adiometics. I then noticed Synergy One made me wake up
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:39.800]  rested and with much more energy. No more hungover, groggy feeling upon arising. I had

[01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:06.760]  We are back live with Joe Gilbert about to drop major truth bombs on the globalists
[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:12.880]  in the next segment. I've got a correction to make. Excuse me, I was going from memory.
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:18.120]  They've just started the Michigan recount and Trump is leading there in the recount
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:23.000]  so far, getting more votes than Hillary is in the recount. But I apologize. I was looking
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:28.840]  at three different numbers from Wisconsin and mixing it up with Michigan. So the correction
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:37.920]  is he doesn't have 32,000 extra votes in Wisconsin. I'm sorry, it's 70 plus thousand directly
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:42.320]  from the state website we're going to update. So see, I'm fake news. I said Trump's winning
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:47.400]  in the recount by 30,000. I'm sorry, it's 70 plus thousand from the state website we're
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:52.840]  putting it up right now. Joel, what do you make of this whole recount situation?
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:59.080]  Look, the leftists never give up. They're trying everything they can. There's no doubt
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:02.960]  that Jill Stein, you know, where did she get all this $7, $8, $9 million from? That's
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:08.080]  more money than she raised for her entire campaign. I have no doubt that Soros and this
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:13.280]  gang is behind it. And they're got to be very vigilant because they can pull any kind
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:20.000]  of tricks, whether it's more voter fraud, or they're trying to cause a doubt in the
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:27.120]  electoral college. They'll always be spending these millions on trying to delegitimize American
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:28.120]  democracy.
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:32.600]  Do you agree with Trump? I mean, Pew Research says it's a fact. It's worse than he said.
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:35.080]  They claimed it was my claim. I was going on Pew Research. They knew that they cut that
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:39.920]  part off. We played the newscast. But Trump knows that there's millions of dead people
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:42.800]  voting, people voting in the name of dead people. There's millions of illegals voting.
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:45.980]  And he points out, hey, I probably really won the popular vote. It wasn't for all the
[01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:48.160]  fraud. And now the recounts are showing that.
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:56.200]  Yeah, this entire system of dead people voting, voter fraud, this was invented in Chicago by
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:26:02.320]  Obama, Alinsky and that gang. Don't forget, Obama was elected originally the state Senate
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:09.240]  because he knew that Alice Palmer's registrations were fraudulent because he himself had engaged
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:14.160]  in the similar activity registering people that weren't qualified. So he had her eliminated.
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:21.680]  Then he ran for Senate and using trickery had, you know, his opponent destroyed by information
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:27.280]  about his divorce coming out. So Obama soared up to the Senate and manipulated the voting
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:28.960]  system in Chicago. It's there.
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:34.000]  Let me ask you this. I haven't harped on this enough. This is a guy with CIA, a sex operative
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:38.480]  mother that's come out. You expose it and others did. His grandfather, high level CIA,
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:43.920]  OSS before that, the army running the banking operations out in Hawaii. They got the fake
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:47.080]  communists, you know, Pornair were probably a double agent. It was grandfather's best
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:52.320]  friends with you expose all that were covered in the next segment, but new info. And then
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:57.240]  he just gets given all these jobs, doesn't show up to class. His records are all sealed.
[01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:02.080]  State Senate, US Senate one term, US president. And then he has the nerve to say Trump isn't
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:09.360]  qualified to organize or run something when he's known as one of the most organized, focused,
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:11.720]  hard driving people in business ever.
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:15.680]  Yeah, it's it's a fact that Obama hit his entire background. That's what I've shown
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:20.040]  in my film. I've got new information I'm coming out with after three additional years of research
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:26.520]  since my film came out, where I'm going to expose even more showing that Barack Obama
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:34.000]  was a poor student. He was a radical leftist state senator. And his entire history was
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.880]  hidden from the public because he could only Trump's entire history is completely in a
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:43.660]  fishbowl. Correct. And all Obama could do is simply say, Oh, you know, my father's a
[01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:48.440]  goat herder from Ken young and to bring everybody together. In reality, his father was a Soviet
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:54.960]  agent and a far left by the way, that's confirmed about Frank Marshall Davis. He was at the
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:59.040]  highest level for the US Communist Party. He was Communist Party USA, one of the original
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:04.040]  black Bolsheviks out of Chicago, joined the Communist Party in 1932. He went to Hawaii
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:10.040]  on orders of the Kremlin to try to start a revolution in Hawaii using the dock workers.
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:14.840]  And he organized a dock workers strike to expel US naval forces from Hawaii. It's because
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:20.120]  the Soviets felt the US naval forces were an obstacle to Soviet expansion in Asia. The
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:24.440]  strike went on for six months and failed in Obama and Frank Marshall Davis became a Communist
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:30.760]  Party newspaper writer, tried to change the NAACP to get them to follow Stalin, got kicked
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:36.320]  out of that got hauled before the Un-American Activities Committee pleaded the fifth. And
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:40.040]  we have all the evidence that this was Frank Marshall, Frank Marshall Davis, Barack Obama's
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:44.560]  biological father and became his ideological mentor. And that's it dreams my real father
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:50.560]  available at Joe Gilbert net also in four store.com. Now, give people a prelude. This
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:54.600]  is big. I knew you were coming here to break big news or honor. You're here. I didn't realize
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:59.400]  how big you are going to break the biggest news yet on Obama on the other side.
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:04.840]  Correct. I've been befriended Obama's best friend from high school that he talks about
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:10.120]  named calls him Ray and his book dreams for my father. His real name is Keith Kakagawa.
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:14.000]  He is in prison, has been in prison in and out all his life at Corcoran State Prison
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:20.200]  in Central California. There I am with Keith in prison. Charles Manson is there as well.
[01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:25.280]  And I visited with him several times and he gave me the information about when Barack
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:29.880]  and how he found out that Frank Marshall Davis was his real father and went through a lot
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:36.640]  of information about his social security number, his relationship with honey Harlow, who was
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:40.800]  Lenny Bruce's ex-wife and stripper living in Hawaii at the time.
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:44.200]  Well, you got photos of these guys in school together. They're admitted friends. This is
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:49.320]  indisputed, but this is breaking here bombshell straight ahead. This is amazing. Stay with
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:56.320]  us. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:24.600]  The controversy is being exploited by the mainstream media to characterize completely
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:31.640]  legitimate alternative news sources. For example, CBS News just listed info wars as a fake news
[01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:37.160]  website. And that's because the mainstream establishment media is losing all credibility
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:42.600]  with the American people. And it was alternative and social media who helped Donald Trump win
[01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:48.040]  the presidential election. So now the globalist battle plan is to indoctrinate the masses
[01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:54.280]  into only accepting the establishment viewpoint of what they want you to believe is real news.

[01:33:54.200 --> 01:34:01.240]  ghetto as matt drudge has said here last year i don't mean to kiss his derriere but he's on target

[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:11.960]  you then they arrest you this is actually happening uh the articles on info wars.com paul's working on

[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:24.440]  hour today eu demand social media website censor fake news within 24 hours uh listed in the same
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:28.840]  context as jihadist propaganda which they would never control they're the ones letting it in
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:33.560]  the european union is demanding that twitter youtube and facebook and always said they're
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:38.600]  letting the jihadis in to finally say we've got to censor them but us too see the european union
[01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:44.360]  is demanding that twitter youtube and facebook censor illegal hate speech within 24 hours content
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:49.880]  includes so-called fake news which we've been put that database a term so broad that it includes
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:56.280]  perfectly legitimate news content complaining that censorship is currently taking too long
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:35:02.360]  EU commissioners are threatening to pass new laws if the non legislative approach fails
[01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:07.640]  the last weeks and months have shown that social media companies need to
[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:12.680]  live their important role and take up the share of responsibility when it comes to phenomenon like
[01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:19.080]  online radicalization illegal hate speech or fake news EU justice commissioner vera

[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:42.520]  floor here to run through some of the background of obama for new listeners who frank marshall
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:47.640]  davis says dreams of my real father we can put some images from the trailer dreams my real father
[01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:53.400]  up on screen for tv viewers again we're a simulcast for your new viewers or listeners and roll through
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:58.600]  come to the background and then the new big bomb shells you've been to hawaii you've been to the
[01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:04.440]  prisons you you've been to california you've gone and met uh with his admitted best friend
[01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:10.520]  from college i mean you have really done it and then once you exposed all this it turns out hiding
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:16.280]  in plain view obama's always pretty much been admitting it uh show let's get into the new
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:20.680]  bombshell information uh with investigative journals documentary filmmaker joel gilbert
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:25.080]  okay thanks alex look the biggest piece of fake news when they came out with this new term i guess
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:30.520]  hillary brought it up i just had to laugh because the biggest fake news was barack obama claiming
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:35.800]  to be the son of a kenyan goat herder who would bring people together uh and his book dreams for
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:42.200]  my father uh myself and others were investigating his background and uh through my film dreams of
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:47.240]  my real father it was an alternate history that showed that barack obama's actual background
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:53.640]  was a radical leftist and uh it traced back to the fact that there was a mountain of evidence
[01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:58.840]  that his real biological father was not the kenyan obama but was rather frank marshall davis the
[01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:05.400]  soviet agent an american communist who he admits in his own book raised him in hawaii uh in obama's
[01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:09.800]  own book dreams for my father he says when i was little my father my grandfather would take me to
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:14.840]  frank's house and it was though there was an unwritten unspoken contract between the two of
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:21.320]  them he also dropped a hint when the kenyan died he said i had no documentation to prove that the
[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:27.720]  kenyan was my real father so he's been dropping hints and uh i reached out since my film came out
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:35.160]  i reached out to keith kakagawa keith kakagawa was the character known as rey in obama's book
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:40.360]  rey was actually the name of their drug dealer from the chung gang there's rey uh real his real
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:45.320]  name is keith kakagawa obama claimed he was black in fact he's actually half hawaii and
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:50.760]  half a quarter indian and a quarter black but keith has been in and out of prison his whole
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:57.240]  life unfortunately he was part of that chung gang pot smoking ring at punahoe and i became friendly
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:01.720]  with uh keith he's in prison at corcoran state prison in central california along with charles
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:08.600]  manson uh and uh he's a very actually nice and sincere guy and he was able to share with me over
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:13.320]  the couple of years that i've known him a lot of information and bombshell information about
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:19.080]  barack's uh upbringing and his relationship with frank marshall davis i'm going to get into some of
[01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:24.120]  those here's an example for people on tv you can see one of the letters from uh prison which he sent
[01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:31.560]  me many of and we we met quite often and uh and speak all the time uh the first things he told me
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:38.760]  were about obama becoming uh very racist and racial as which he said was a result of him hanging out
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:43.800]  with frank marshall davis three or four times a week at least for an hour and that frank was
[01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:49.000]  essentially his father in every meaning of the word uh he gave examples for instance that they
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:55.960]  went to the senior prom and even though they were 15 years old and the girls were 17 and 18
[01:41:55.960 --> 01:42:02.600]  and uh barry as he calls him complained that the seniors won't dance with him because he's black
[01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:06.440]  and keith would point out and say well no it's because we're 15 and we're dressed for a luau
[01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:11.400]  and then barry complained that he wasn't able to start on the basketball team because
[01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:17.000]  he was black and keith told him no it's because you can't make a shot and you can't rebound you're
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:22.440]  on the team because you're black and barry went on to talk about how his own grandfather couldn't
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:28.200]  understand him because he was black so he said that uh barry became a radical wannabe and it
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:33.800]  was a result of frank marshall davis turning him on to angela davis and malcolm x and barry
[01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:40.440]  becoming uh extremely racial about everything then he tells me this bombshell story that when in
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:47.800]  1977 he was with barock or barry as he called him in the alamonoa mall in waikiki at a sporting
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:53.320]  good store and all of a sudden barry says that's my father over there and keith says what are you
[01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:58.520]  talking about that that black man there i recognize him from the pictures that's my father from kenya
[01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:05.080]  and keith said no way and barock ran over to him and he said are you barack obama and he said yes
[01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:08.680]  who are you he said well i'm your son he said well what are you doing in hawaii he said well i'm
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:14.280]  gonna lay over from hong kong going back to to kenya and by the way malik obama confirmed for me
[01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:21.080]  that uh his father had gone to hong kong at that time and the kenyan obama basically blew off barock
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:30.600]  blew him off and left and keith explains that that moment set off barry or barock on a tirade where
[01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:37.320]  he went to his mother frank his grandfather and said you all lied to me frank is my father i've
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:44.280]  always known it he spends time with me he gives me money i look like him uh you've been lying to me
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:49.800]  and he said for a couple of months they all denied it and it barry got so out of control that the
[01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:56.600]  grandfather grants came to keith and said listen this story is true but he can't talk about this i
[01:43:56.600 --> 01:44:01.480]  don't want him talking about it so next time he talks about i want you to smack him and keith said
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:05.560]  i can't hit barry he said no no you gotta hit him next time he talks about this so keith said that
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:10.120]  sure enough barry kept screaming about it and he put him in a chokehold dragged him down the street
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:17.240]  and that all of a sudden barry stopped talking about it and this was about the time that these
[01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:23.080]  poemers wrote people are familiar with called pop where uh this it's like an explanation of an
[01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:29.400]  encounter between a young man and an older man and in the poem he says uh he looked just like
[01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:35.480]  me he gave me a hug and i could see myself inside of pop's black frame glasses so it's as if there
[01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:40.760]  was some kind of admission and they wrote a poem to kind of memorialize it so this is a pretty bombshell
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:44.760]  it comes from obama's best friend who's written throughout his written about throughout his book
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:51.720]  as his best friend and it shows that barock uh had this big moment where he was lied to his whole
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:56.840]  life but realized it was the by like came to know it was a biological father and that davis
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:45:03.480]  continued to be his ideological father uh and continued to radicalize him by taking him down
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:09.880]  to places like uh this is also brand new news there was a strip club in hotel street down in
[01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:16.280]  honolulu called hubba hubba and a lot of the marines would go down in military would go down
[01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:20.920]  to hotel street it's known for many many years so at hubba hubba frank would take him there
[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:25.320]  they would have these all kind of nefarious things i don't even want to say on this show
[01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:33.000]  no i didn't say it well okay i'll say it well he basically said that the hubba hubba had uh
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:38.120]  private nights that were not advertised where people would come and all kind of things would go on
[01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:43.880]  that you could possibly imagine and that this was a location that frank would take uh barry now
[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:51.800]  interestingly the manager of the sex parties swingers party sex parties so the manager of hubba
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:57.880]  hubba was none other than honey harlow honey harlow was the famous stripper who was the ex-wife of
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:03.160]  lennie bruce who lived in honolulu all those years have a photo her yes we got a photo of honey harlow
[01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:12.040]  now honey harlow i've identified as the stripper who poses in the photos with and dunham at frank
[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:18.200]  marshal davis's house uh that came out in my film that is honey harlow now now before we go here
[01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:21.720]  let's rewind this for a minute for tv viewers and radio listeners yeah people understand if you've
[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:26.520]  seen your film on this and you've done research and you've read obama's book he admits all this
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:32.680]  and later versions they took it out so 95 percent of what you're saying is on record you found photos
[01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:38.520]  of obama with frank marshal davis and people and with others and it's the same house it's the same
[01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:43.640]  couch it's the same pictures then there's all this porn that davis admittedly shot on the side
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:48.920]  that's what the communists do correct to fund themselves drugs you name it and so it's his
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:55.480]  mother it's clearly her posing it's the same woman in the photos all this from this racy culture
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:47:01.160]  in hawaii in the 60s in the 70s and of course before that back in the 50s so so so start at
[01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:08.120]  the beginning again okay so frank marshal davis was a photographer of nude women and he took these
[01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:13.800]  photos of an and honey harlow and other strippers and sold them to the betty page uh you know strip
[01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:19.080]  magazines of the town and you were contacted by one of the famous off-record collectors of all
[01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:24.440]  this saying hey i've got i've got obama's mother yeah we we acquired this stuff about four years ago
[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:30.360]  and uh look it's not to uh make fun of the fact that his his mother was posing for nude photos
[01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:35.480]  it's it's intended to show that there was the chance of a relationship to help prove the fact
[01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:40.040]  that obama lied to the country he ran as a mainstream candidate well he's a total government
[01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:45.560]  cutout is the point with multiple multiple names he's got passports and stuff let's say berry he's
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:51.000]  got uh the different last names on there he lists himself as a muslim in indonesia i mean this guy
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:55.080]  has got more names than you know a villain in the james bond movie well here's the next revelation
[01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:59.320]  we'll get back to hubba hubba but uh well i don't mean to interrupt you let's go back and finish up
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:04.920]  with the with the with the porn okay so uh honey harlow who was the uh ex-wife of lennie bruce she
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:09.720]  lived in hawaii at the time it's all documented and that is her uh i'm certain in the photos with
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:15.480]  ann dunham that further places that photo in hawaii and you can see the uh obvious resemblance
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:21.800]  and uh in a way keith kakagawa told me that frank would take a berry down there they would
[01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:27.880]  do a lot of drinking and drugging and this was the period where obama became radicalized and
[01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:33.160]  saw the world through a racial lens the same as frank marshall davis it's the same person as
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:38.280]  essentially uh reverend jeremiah right everything is racial everything is because of race now the
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:43.640]  disappointment uh voters have with obamas of course they voted for him based on this false news
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:48.040]  story that he floated in his book that he's a post-racial person he's going to bring us all
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:52.440]  together because of his unique but notice all he did was engage in race baiting and division
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:57.320]  massively correct down even hiring organizers to go stir up riots correct and this is why it's
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:49:02.760]  important to really reveal who obama was but does he even get that that causes cops to slow
[01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:07.400]  roll and kills thousands of black americans and that it creates real racism and division
[01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:11.560]  i mean i guess that's what they want it's not about that it's about the revolution it's about
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:16.760]  long-term control and they realize uh so you got to radicalize and try to make as many black people
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:21.640]  as you can racial and hateful so they never assimilate or have it yeah the uh obama wrote in
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:26.360]  his book about reading fallen you know the algerian revolution and they said there's gonna be blood
[01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:32.440]  there's gonna be a price to pay for uh achieving long-term uh takeover and revel the leftist
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:37.720]  revolution so all of these things are just uh you know all i can say is good luck with them
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:41.400]  with their older censorship their plans for violence i'm not looking for violence but man
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:46.040]  these wimps want to start a physical fight we are going to clean their clocks i mean
[01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:51.720]  these people can hardly tie their freaking shoelaces libertarians patriots americana people are
[01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:59.080]  wrecking machines go ahead oh look obviously the the the best way to cleanse the situation
[01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:02.920]  is truth and to illuminate and tell the truth about that's what we're gonna do but but see
[01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:06.760]  they know we're beating them in the info war so they want to censor us and start a revolution
[01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:09.960]  correct all i'm saying is they're a bunch of idiots the little communists they've got down here
[01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:15.000]  saying kill cops oink oink bang bang you're dead how many cut it was five good cops dead good yeah
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:19.400]  but six is better these little minions they're not a point of gun the right way is what i'm saying
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:24.840]  they are the most moron cannon fodder idiots and none of them will ever talk to you they say
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:29.800]  talk to my boss it's always some old weird ut beatnik behind them right because they have nothing

[01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:29.880]  going to condense all this down he's about to break more on the birth certificate so obama
[01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:34.520]  he's the guy that cracked the code on all of this and why he kept saying in his when he was the editor
[01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:38.280]  of the law review at harvard that he was born in kenya and his father was there and why his wife
[01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:44.280]  when he was a us senator said he was born in kenya you know my husband barack is born in kenya
[01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:49.400]  and we'd say here are the videos why does he keep saying he wasn't it was all a setup we took the
[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:55.080]  bait of course the dad looked nothing like him uh it because it wasn't it was another one of these
[01:54:55.080 --> 01:55:00.760]  sham marriages that that left us due to bring people into the u.s for money it's very very famous
[01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:06.600]  it's she was cia fox was all part of the cutouts we're going back to uh joel gilbert uh here in
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:12.920]  just a moment but i want to just remind listeners that if you look at the psychology of the globalist
[01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:17.720]  it doesn't make sense i go back to ron silver the hollywood producer and actor who recently died
[01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:23.160]  and it was the clinton's being inaugurated in 1993 and jets flew over and he said oh my gosh it's
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:26.760]  the military they're going to get us because they so much hated our military in america
[01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:30.680]  and hillary went and this was even in i think was rolling stone you can look it up she goes ron
[01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:37.240]  it's our military now but see they're so mentally ill and so stilted and so weird
[01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:44.600]  and hate you owning a gun but boy they love the red guard with a gun that they just see fear
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:48.440]  everywhere and everyone's out to get them and there's racism everywhere whether they be white
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:53.320]  jewish you know black it doesn't matter it's you know chinese it's just all whacked out and they've
[01:55:53.320 --> 01:55:57.800]  got to overthrow it to run it to make it better and even though they pretty much run the country
[01:55:57.800 --> 01:56:02.280]  they should just go oh prosperity let's just run this you've already dominated no no no now we've
[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:07.480]  got to shut it down we've got to prove it's wrong we've got to mount its head on the wall there's
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:13.320]  this drive to just piss on things and fly over country and bitter clingers with their bibles
[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:18.360]  their guns and make fun of you know families that have a swimming pool and are nuclear and go to
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:23.160]  softball games it's not just a disdain for white people they hate black people they hate i mean
[01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:26.840]  i've seen the left in news models go the Hispanics don't trust us and they won't get rid of their
[01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:32.280]  families and you know they won't go along with our ideology like we want them to they're so angry
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:36.440]  so i'm not trying to a cliffhanger here i want to get into the the incredible other developers
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:40.440]  you haven't got to we start the next segment but the few minutes here you've studied communist
[01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:44.360]  you've gone deep into how they operate you know you interviewed of course and so have we the late
[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:50.200]  great larry graph wall that went inside the weatherman operations uh what makes them tick why
[01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:57.320]  do they hate this country and prosperity so much uh leftist progressives have a passion for
[01:56:57.320 --> 01:57:03.960]  destruction that is only equaled by the islamists the islamists and the progressives have that thing
[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:09.160]  in common that they both want to destroy the existing order and rebuild society from scratch
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:14.600]  uh us conservatives or just what we call where i come from in tennessee we just call it normal folks
[01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:19.560]  we look at america and we look at the world and we say america is is the greatest country that
[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:24.920]  ever has been and we're so happy to be american we're so happy uh leftists look at america and
[01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:30.920]  compare it to the perfect you society to perfect utopia and they conclude uh it's not perfect so
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:35.560]  we have to tear it down and and destroy it and rebuild it from scratch and we're very unhappy
[01:57:35.560 --> 01:57:42.200]  so uh the the mentality is is just so different and the leftist passion for destruction is uh
[01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:49.880]  something that is um such a tragic uh phenomena was that an accurate description i did of them
[01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:55.160]  i believe so i just don't get how you're in charge the systems made you the president
[01:57:55.160 --> 01:58:00.120]  record numbers of whites have voted for you and then you say it's a white lash when trump gets
[01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:05.960]  elected it's it's just pure crap well their ideology is to use people and use groups to take power
[01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:11.880]  not to take power to help people but to use them and and communist ideology admits they're
[01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:17.320]  exploitive it's so cold-blooded right they used urban america the black people uh black lives
[01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:21.640]  never mattered to them blacks vote mattered that's why obama did nothing for the black community
[01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:25.080]  in eight years all right long segments coming up there's another five minute one writer start
[01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:30.840]  i'll talk about islamic ideology because orthodox islam is radical islam it's taking over it admits

[02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:43.240]  i was like this individually just interviewed in prison but coming up the other big revelations
[02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:47.320]  he's only gotten one halfway through or less your big revelations here that i appreciate you
[02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:51.240]  sharing with us joel gilbert's our guest joel gilbert.net in this short segment getting into
[02:00:51.240 --> 02:00:55.560]  the islamicist uh they constantly fight with each other they constantly kill each other
[02:00:55.560 --> 02:01:01.480]  they're constantly invading each other radical uh the radicals form obviously out of Saudi Arabia
[02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:06.040]  while hobbyism is allied with the left they throw gays off buildings murder christians
[02:01:07.160 --> 02:01:11.160]  and leftists get this wild look in their eye out these rallies screaming at us
[02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:15.720]  at trump rallies saying homophobes i go you're next to muslims they kill gay people
[02:01:15.720 --> 02:01:21.560]  shut up racist shut up i mean it's a disconnect but what's going on with the islamist what are
[02:01:21.560 --> 02:01:30.680]  they looking for uh islamists reject uh western culture uh the way they look at the world is
[02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:37.320]  that the islamic world should be a homogeneous caliphate the idea of islam is that one day it
[02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:43.080]  will control the entire world and only then will the world uh reach salvation therefore islam does
[02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:50.040]  not recognize borders or individual countries uh after world war one the european powers divided
[02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:57.080]  the islamic world into individual nation states uh the problem is that nation states were a christian
[02:01:57.080 --> 02:02:01.000]  solution to christian problems they never had those it was just tribes murdering each other well
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:07.320]  it was one large islamic controlled caliphate ottoman yeah the ottoman empire and before that with a
[02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:13.960]  with a single destiny to expand across the world by dividing the islamic world up into nation states
[02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:19.640]  it created a uh scenario where the islamist uh felt they had to destroy the nation states
[02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:23.640]  get rid of these autocrats and military leaders that were preventing them
[02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:28.600]  from their natural expansion so the opposition the islam wasn't that a natural divide and conquer
[02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:32.840]  the early strategy to divide them up was kind of uh the western powers certainly felt that
[02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:37.480]  by dividing them up and having certain alliances they'd be able to prevent them from continuing
[02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:42.920]  to attack europe as they had done historically for a thousand but now the the globalist the euro
[02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:49.960]  is openly allied with them well now the i think it's more that the leftists see the uh muslims
[02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:56.840]  and the islamic world as natural allies with the mutual goal of destroying the uh the western order
[02:02:56.840 --> 02:03:01.000]  the uh well if i had a cold and i wanted to get rid of it a natural ally would be colloidal silver
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:06.840]  or vitamin c or sunshine or light exercise or chicken noodle soup not inject myself with cancer
[02:03:06.840 --> 02:03:12.600]  is just going to kill the the cold and me well the the leftists are are desperate for anyone
[02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:16.680]  that can help them achieve their goal they think they can use the islamist the way they used urban
[02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:22.680]  america they think they can use uh immigrants from honduras and central america and flood the
[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:26.920]  country with illegals well the muslims are 10 times more maccube alley than the left so i think it's
[02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:30.600]  you i don't i think they don't know which one's the fox well there's no question the leftist i
[02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:35.240]  think don't really understand the end game and end goal of these of the islamists would also mean
[02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:39.240]  that the uh leftists are going to be eliminated they're they're up for a course they are they're
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:45.000]  in for a natural clash down the road but in the meantime uh i think the left sees yeah i found the
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:49.320]  muslims respect me because i openly say what i believe and they'll just go yeah we're going to
[02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:54.120]  take you over the leftists they just laugh at them it's like a yeah they don't they they think that
[02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:59.400]  the left is self-destructive which they are uh look the the left uh progressives killed 150
[02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:03.960]  million of their own people in peacetime because they didn't fit into this perfect ideology of
[02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:07.640]  this perfect anybody that didn't have you had glasses or could basically talk they were threatened
[02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:12.760]  by them right in cambodia they killed everybody who had glasses because that way they could start
[02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:17.800]  over because that meant you were educated they wanted to reeducate you with the communist ideology
[02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:24.600]  so the uh the nexus and the alliance between the far left and islam we see it in western
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:30.920]  societies in england the of course the mayor of uh of london london's first month in london stan we
[02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:36.520]  see uh of course keith ellison now wants to be the uh head of the democrat party and we can see
[02:04:36.520 --> 02:04:42.040]  this nexus coming together whether it will last we don't know do you want to do the whole next
[02:04:42.040 --> 02:04:45.720]  hour with me or are you i'm good all right and then after that mcbrane wants to interview for the
[02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:50.600]  nightly news or it might be lehan doing and they're both excited to talk to you uh jill gilbert's
[02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:55.160]  studio i'm alex jones the big bomb shells straight ahead but first i want to ask you one more question
[02:04:55.800 --> 02:05:01.960]  how do you successfully program a leftist i know you're really good at it the web giants at youtube
[02:05:01.960 --> 02:05:07.960]  facebook twitter and microsoft have announced that they are stepping up efforts to remove
[02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:15.400]  extremist content from the internet as the e u demands social media websites censor fake news
[02:05:15.400 --> 02:05:22.760]  within 24 hours meanwhile the fake news controversy is being exploited by the mainstream media to
[02:05:22.760 --> 02:05:29.720]  characterize completely legitimate alternative news sources for example cbs news just listed info
[02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:36.040]  wars as a fake news website and that's because the mainstream establishment media is losing all
[02:05:36.040 --> 02:05:41.480]  credibility with the american people and it was alternative and social media who helped donald
[02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:47.800]  trump win the presidential election so now the globalist battle plan is to indoctrinate the masses
[02:05:47.800 --> 02:05:54.360]  into only accepting the establishment viewpoint of what they want you to believe is real news
[02:05:54.360 --> 02:06:03.160]  you can learn more right now at info wars dot com there was a mighty nation rest above all of

[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:30.040]  isn't boycott this is trump you're in in 43 days roughly 44 days we want you to immediately now
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:36.120]  start saying how dare you fund 170 million dollars for a fake news bureau in the state department
[02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:40.120]  and then have obama announcing state-run media and europe announcing they're launching it as we
[02:10:40.120 --> 02:10:45.000]  speak to shut us down we have to fight back we have to rally we have to say you're the fake news
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:50.520]  lying about you know all these wars and lying about what trump was really doing and and lying
[02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:54.680]  about the borders not being open you're a joke so we're going to be launching that in the next
[02:10:54.680 --> 02:10:59.720]  24 hours at info wars dot com now i was asking you the question i mean look at the leftist media
[02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:04.760]  praising for del castro give us your take on that and then is there any way to reach out because
[02:11:04.760 --> 02:11:11.640]  the average leftist was sheltered they were generally from middle class means and i mean the
[02:11:11.640 --> 02:11:17.160]  active really bad leftist the social justice warriors they they hate america they hate freedom
[02:11:17.160 --> 02:11:21.080]  they hate prosperity they have chips on their shoulder and they were kind of like nerds that
[02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:26.280]  didn't have any friends i don't mean that mean and then they get adopted as soon as they get into
[02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:31.080]  college or even by high school clubs into a leftist cult that indoctrinates them with hate they
[02:11:31.080 --> 02:11:36.840]  kind of get little nerdly lonely kids and then brainwashing and so they're so inculcated it's
[02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:41.880]  their identity and they act like adults who are really still teenagers with the rest of
[02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:46.520]  development so joe gilbert that's my gestalt on it how do you i mean add to that or how do you
[02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:51.560]  reach out to them let me add to that nothing is more hypocritical than uh looking at the
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:59.160]  leftist infatuation with uh tyrants and murderers like fiddle castro che guavara and even back in
[02:11:59.160 --> 02:12:05.720]  the day of course obama's father frank marshall davis was infatuated with stalin uh uncle joe
[02:12:05.720 --> 02:12:10.520]  was the god was their guide the leftist guy in the fifties uncle joe killed what 25 million people
[02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:16.760]  at least at least uh so their infatuation their their claim to uh being uh having these values
[02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:22.760]  these great values yet they're infatuated with some of the biggest murderers in history uh is the
[02:12:22.760 --> 02:12:29.720]  is the greatest uh hypocrisy that just shows their denial of facts they don't want to learn facts
[02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:34.680]  well they also tend to be really wimpy people uh and again i think they're attracted to the
[02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:41.560]  authoritarian regalia the simplicity of it right for them this is like a father figure and this is
[02:12:41.560 --> 02:12:47.400]  the person they can look to who tells them uh kind of what to think how to think and tell them
[02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:51.960]  that there's a utopian perfect world that they can be a part of if they only follow him like the
[02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:57.080]  wizard of us like my so how do you program one of them look i have not had a whole lot of luck
[02:12:57.080 --> 02:13:01.960]  when i try to show them my film they leave the uh the theater uh when you try to talk to them they
[02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:10.200]  cut you off and talk over you uh the reality over time reality uh tends to convince them otherwise
[02:13:10.200 --> 02:13:16.040]  uh i met people in urban america when i was filming there's no place like utopia and they had had it
[02:13:16.040 --> 02:13:21.880]  with leftist uh uh high taxes had driven out all the jobs the drug cult and i think it's
[02:13:21.880 --> 02:13:26.280]  blacks voting for uh trump if you look at anyone demographic and also the scramble whites voted
[02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:31.000]  for obama it's those two groups as well as an unusual large turnout of hispanics i think
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:34.680]  every major group they were counting on turned against them yeah i think a lot more blacks
[02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:40.840]  voted for uh trump then uh were willing to admit it to the exit poll people or that actually showed
[02:13:40.840 --> 02:13:45.080]  up uh because they lived it so once people experience it people coming out of the soviet
[02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:50.840]  union back in the day east germany people coming out of cuba they'll tell you and for their entire
[02:13:50.840 --> 02:13:56.280]  life they'll say do not follow barack obama oh everybody came out of the old soviet union
[02:13:56.280 --> 02:14:00.680]  or cuba or venezuela says i've heard it all before correct they say we're shocked at how
[02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:05.960]  they use the very same terms they're so lazy but i think it's worked in these countries
[02:14:05.960 --> 02:14:11.720]  so why not use it again but it really is weird to see 20th century and 19th century political
[02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:16.680]  technology being used to dominate today well look we're still in great danger because uh we saw
[02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:22.280]  bernie sanders have these huge rallies with young people thousands and thousands of people
[02:14:22.280 --> 02:14:26.440]  cheering everything he said what did he say he said we're going to destroy american business
[02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:29.720]  we're going to break up the pharmaceutical companies we're going to break up the banks
[02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:34.840]  we're going to do all these uh classic communist things that destroy the economy and
[02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:39.000]  by a lot instead of reforming those institutions we're going to blow them up and then always
[02:14:39.640 --> 02:14:44.360]  on it they build a nightmare of starvation and people in black uniforms well their goal
[02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:47.720]  the terminology used to be the bourgeois we're going to destroy the bourgeois put them in
[02:14:47.720 --> 02:14:53.080]  jail sent them to reeducation centers and today it's the entrepreneurs they want to destroy business
[02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:57.560]  and they want to replace the leading class of society with bureaucrats once the leading
[02:14:57.560 --> 02:15:03.000]  society of his bureaucrats they don't produce anything so there's no products being produced
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:07.560]  and there ends up being no food like we see in in venezuela and then they admit though that
[02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:13.560]  that's good because it's austere but then they all live like pigs and animal farm you know high on
[02:15:13.560 --> 02:15:19.240]  the hog right well it just came out last week fidel castrow had uh yachts and and boats and uh
[02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:23.880]  five or six wives and he's so unpopular they had to secretly bury him at a secret location
[02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:31.320]  right so these guys uh look uh the the the leftist ideal uh somehow because of the media because of
[02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:36.520]  universities and journalism and uh politicians claiming that these things work i mean i was
[02:15:36.520 --> 02:15:41.160]  just shocked to see people with bernie sanders cheering him on but what it is is stockholm syndrome
[02:15:41.720 --> 02:15:44.920]  in that they're put into a cult they're put into a college they're given a worthless degree they
[02:15:44.920 --> 02:15:49.080]  have no future they're going to get hin pecked into submission they might as well become aggressive
[02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:53.720]  and be the greatest enforcers of it they have studies out that with this whole virtue signaling
[02:15:53.720 --> 02:15:57.720]  that uh in canada the u.s and in britain they found very similar numbers people can pull these
[02:15:57.720 --> 02:16:02.280]  articles up i've talked about them a lot but it was even in the cbc of all places that they were
[02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:07.800]  six times more likely to steal and something like eight times more likely not to give to charity
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:12.360]  when they said they were but they were more likely to tell you to give to charity so they're always
[02:16:12.360 --> 02:16:17.720]  just signaling that they're so moral and so great but they're not hiring minorities they're not
[02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:22.200]  building industries they're not actually inventing anything they're just running around bitching
[02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:30.280]  unfortunately there they have so many internal mental conflicts that derive from the the believing
[02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:33.640]  in the lie look at cappernick that look at cappernick i think we're gonna be breaking news
[02:16:34.200 --> 02:16:40.760]  170 180 million dollars he's made his career he's horrible he's he's he's a loser uh he has white
[02:16:40.760 --> 02:16:47.240]  parents that took care of him uh hates white people runs around bitching all day and loves fidel
[02:16:47.240 --> 02:16:51.240]  and then people said well alex he does people are racist to him does he have any idea how racist
[02:16:51.240 --> 02:16:56.360]  they are to black people in cuba look uh cappernick should have spent his whole life saying god bless
[02:16:56.360 --> 02:17:02.680]  america what a great country i uh i made 170 million and again i criticized the parts of the
[02:17:02.680 --> 02:17:07.560]  country they're bad to make it better not just it's the worst thing hate it for no reason
[02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:13.320]  it's uh anyway the leftist mentality of what leads them to go on off on all these crazy
[02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:19.880]  tangents are very self what they are is ingrained full uh i mean i'm look it's like spoiled kids
[02:17:19.880 --> 02:17:25.000]  ingrained full entitlement entitlement is the worst damn thing on earth you give a kid everything
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:29.720]  they turn into snot nose brat criminals well i think my parents are being mean making me have
[02:17:29.720 --> 02:17:33.640]  jobs and not giving me money and stuff thank god they did they were better parents than i am i've
[02:17:33.640 --> 02:17:37.400]  spoiled my kids they're still great kids but now we're having to really start making them do more
[02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:42.120]  stuff because because i'm telling you these snot nose lazy asses i don't mean my kids i'm talking
[02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:46.040]  about the general you know leftists right well let's get into some of these revelations because
[02:17:46.040 --> 02:17:49.880]  they really show yeah these are these are huge these are massive let's skip this breaks we have
[02:17:49.880 --> 02:17:53.960]  more time joe gilbert get it and recap the the previous one's real fast to get to the new ones
[02:17:53.960 --> 02:17:59.080]  okay i just uh talked about my uh friendship with obama's best friend keith kakagawa who's in
[02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:05.480]  jail in quarkland state prison who told me about what how barack barry learned that the canon was
[02:18:05.480 --> 02:18:12.520]  not his father and that frank marshall davis was how davis radicalized obama with his racist
[02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:19.320]  racial world view and how obama would go to the hubba hubba strip club with frank and uh
[02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:25.640]  met up with uh honey harlow lenny bruce's ex wife who also was involved with his mother way back
[02:18:25.640 --> 02:18:29.880]  in the day with frank marshall davis so we went through that and today i'm releasing kind of the
[02:18:29.880 --> 02:18:35.720]  rest of my obama research for the past few years i'm releasing two birth certificates today on
[02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:41.720]  info wars uh from black men born in hawaii one was born a few weeks before obama and one born
[02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:47.480]  a few weeks after obama and in both of these birth certificates the father is listed under the racial
[02:18:47.480 --> 02:18:54.200]  terminology that was encoded in the hawaii uh guidebooks for the registrar the racial designation
[02:18:54.200 --> 02:19:00.120]  was negro not african now everyone knows that obama's father's race is listed as african of
[02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:04.280]  course which is african-american now in this one that people can see on their screen this is from
[02:19:04.280 --> 02:19:09.640]  a man named bruce henderson born a few weeks after that term wasn't used until the 80s correct
[02:19:09.640 --> 02:19:13.400]  now this is interesting so this gentleman was born a few weeks after obama and you can also
[02:19:13.400 --> 02:19:18.920]  see how the type sticks to the to the background and uh then we go to the second one which was
[02:19:18.920 --> 02:19:23.800]  from a few weeks before the man's name was james gravely and what's so interesting about james
[02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:30.120]  gravely the race originally was written down as colored which was the terminology in the 50s
[02:19:30.120 --> 02:19:36.040]  that had just changed in 1960 this data hawaii issued a new guidebook for the registrars but
[02:19:36.040 --> 02:19:41.160]  the person accidentally wrote the old term which was colored so the state of hawaii registrar's
[02:19:41.160 --> 02:19:47.320]  office marked it out and wrote the correct new term which was negro therefore oh well it was
[02:19:47.320 --> 02:19:51.960]  just spanish for black or it was like caucasian niggas caucus mountains right but they turn that
[02:19:51.960 --> 02:19:57.560]  into a racist term words now are racist so this proves that obama's birth certificate where the
[02:19:57.560 --> 02:20:04.040]  race is listed as african never would have survived the review at the hawaii department of health
[02:20:04.040 --> 02:20:08.360]  just like the word color didn't survive the word african would not have survived because the term
[02:20:08.360 --> 02:20:15.240]  was negro now why would this of course what we what became known as the birther controversy was
[02:20:15.240 --> 02:20:21.560]  invented by the fake news media people simply ask questions they said if you say your you did all
[02:20:21.560 --> 02:20:28.200]  these things why won't you release your uh college records why won't you release your senate records
[02:20:28.200 --> 02:20:33.400]  why won't you release your birth certificate people simply ask the question now i guess
[02:20:33.400 --> 02:20:38.360]  they didn't make up the term university ism notice how the green paper isn't yellowed either
[02:20:38.360 --> 02:20:44.040]  from acid like the original real ones totally fake and again we're not saying he wasn't really from
[02:20:44.040 --> 02:20:50.680]  hawaii it was just a fake certificate with the fake father supposedly from kenya they had to do that
[02:20:51.640 --> 02:20:57.960]  just like the fbi and others say cheese pizza means child porn so you have pizza gate they then
[02:20:57.960 --> 02:21:04.200]  in the media focus on one pizza place claiming we're all only talking about that to then discredit
[02:21:04.200 --> 02:21:09.320]  the entire pedestrian emails this is how they take things and they decide what to make everybody
[02:21:09.320 --> 02:21:14.120]  focus in on then we all go chasing after it right so obama's candidacy was based on his
[02:21:14.120 --> 02:21:18.520]  personal background my father's a goat herder from kenya i have a multiracial background i'm
[02:21:18.520 --> 02:21:22.840]  going to bring us together i'm going to cut the deficit in half so we ask a legitimate question
[02:21:22.840 --> 02:21:28.040]  why can't we see your your anything about your past and the birth certificate college records are
[02:21:28.040 --> 02:21:32.040]  sealed everything's sealed so they turn us when you know about his past it's sealed into we're
[02:21:32.040 --> 02:21:39.000]  saying he isn't really uh from from uh the us he's from kenya so we look and he is saying he's
[02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:44.360]  from kenya in his college records and in his uh newspaper that he edited and his wife's saying
[02:21:44.360 --> 02:21:50.600]  it so we we took the the bait right so i think uh obama's real i don't believe the the birth
[02:21:50.600 --> 02:21:55.560]  certificate he released is is real based on just only based on this but you can also see
[02:21:55.560 --> 02:22:01.560]  in some other comparisons i released that obama's birth certificate the type is uh on a white
[02:22:01.560 --> 02:22:07.240]  background whereas you can see the natural regular background the black type sticks to the background
[02:22:07.240 --> 02:22:13.240]  it's not on a white uh you know facade and you can see that in these documents i'm releasing
[02:22:13.240 --> 02:22:17.400]  sure it's clearly digital i mean look look they even use like the microsoft word deal
[02:22:17.400 --> 02:22:21.240]  where a typewriter has a new original splat each time with them the letters and numbers
[02:22:21.240 --> 02:22:27.160]  are identical they use different you know fonts uh but uh per line but you can see it's it's it's
[02:22:27.160 --> 02:22:31.640]  fake right so i believe obama was always eligible to be president was probably born in the united
[02:22:31.640 --> 02:22:37.720]  states but he had his real birth certificate probably either was blank with the father unknown
[02:22:37.720 --> 02:22:42.200]  or even possibly frank marshall davis now had he released the birth certificate without the name
[02:22:42.200 --> 02:22:47.320]  barack obama on it uh then i think it would have debunked his entire story how do you get the name
[02:22:47.320 --> 02:22:53.720]  barry sataro because then we know that's on passports well the sataro uh they also had another
[02:22:53.720 --> 02:22:59.720]  name which was so barca which showed up on on other documents so sataro was the name of andanum's
[02:22:59.720 --> 02:23:05.400]  next husband which was uh lola sataro so when he went to indonesia he became barry sataro
[02:23:05.400 --> 02:23:10.520]  and the name so barca people get that mixed up the name so barca which showed up that's simply
[02:23:10.520 --> 02:23:15.560]  sataro barack backwards which is which is how they had names in indonesia your family name was first
[02:23:15.560 --> 02:23:20.600]  so it was combined as one name but uh anyway i want to release these birth certificates i
[02:23:20.600 --> 02:23:26.440]  collected because it shows that obama was not honest about who his real father was and this
[02:23:26.440 --> 02:23:31.640]  as much as we don't like being lied to about that uh obviously it hides the fact that obama
[02:23:31.640 --> 02:23:36.680]  was indoctrinated and radicalized by his real father that he admits raised him by his own admission
[02:23:36.680 --> 02:23:43.000]  frank marshall davis and he became this uh leftist radical and he followed in the footsteps of his
[02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:49.320]  real father dreamed from his real father back to chicago and he became an agitator and eventually
[02:23:49.320 --> 02:23:55.160]  became president based on the fake news that uh his his real father and upbringing was this generic
[02:23:55.800 --> 02:24:00.520]  upbringing that had nothing to do with a radical background uh the next thing i want to get into
[02:24:00.520 --> 02:24:05.400]  is to discuss what i learned about obama's social security number it's pretty brief but it's
[02:24:05.400 --> 02:24:10.920]  interesting uh keith kakagawa told me that obama had worked for his father who had a
[02:24:10.920 --> 02:24:17.480]  pest control service called island pest control in the summers and that barack is known to the
[02:24:17.480 --> 02:24:22.680]  public as having a social security number that was issued from connecticut and people say well
[02:24:22.680 --> 02:24:28.040]  how could that be uh well keith told me that barack actually had several social security numbers
[02:24:28.600 --> 02:24:33.800]  and that it was not uncommon that many people in hawaii had several there was massive document
[02:24:33.800 --> 02:24:40.120]  fraud and social security fraud and that they would get aid from the government with multiple
[02:24:40.840 --> 02:24:44.840]  social security numbers and multiple identities and i think it still goes on to this day the
[02:24:44.840 --> 02:24:51.880]  entire state system in hawaii uh was uh was unreliable as regards documentation and that he
[02:24:51.880 --> 02:24:56.040]  said barry had several social security numbers and that was simply one of them i guess that he
[02:24:56.040 --> 02:25:02.040]  that he settled on uh so that was interesting and that fills in some of the void uh the next
[02:25:02.040 --> 02:25:06.840]  thing i want to do can we cue that uh there's a quick clip from good morning america that
[02:25:06.840 --> 02:25:11.640]  where barack talks about having studied abroad and lived abroad and i want to give that some
[02:25:11.640 --> 02:25:17.080]  context and give you another piece of information sure here's a good morning america peace are you
[02:25:17.080 --> 02:25:23.000]  concerned that your lack of experience when it comes to foreign policy may hurt your chances in
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:27.800]  the run for the white house uh well actually you know my experience in foreign policy is probably
[02:25:27.800 --> 02:25:33.320]  more diverse than most others in the field i mean i'm somebody who has actually lived overseas
[02:25:34.040 --> 02:25:39.560]  somebody who has studied overseas uh you know i majored in international relations but uh
[02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:45.560]  it so uh here barack uh let's slip uh what he didn't want to know now his official story in
[02:25:45.560 --> 02:25:50.600]  his book is that he was at columbia for two years i'm sorry occidental college in la for two years
[02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:55.800]  and transferred to columbia for two years and when he was running for president hannity others
[02:25:55.800 --> 02:25:59.720]  came out and said wait a minute how could he have been at columbia two years we never met him we never
[02:25:59.720 --> 02:26:06.840]  heard of him classmates never saw him and uh in this interview uh barack revealed something he says
[02:26:06.840 --> 02:26:12.440]  i studied abroad and lived abroad now he wasn't talking about when i was five years old i was
[02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:20.040]  in kindergarten in indonesia he let it slip that he was abroad for a study program now uh he was
[02:26:20.040 --> 02:26:25.720]  had that for years right so uh my belief and i'll tell you why i believe this is that he was on a
[02:26:25.720 --> 02:26:32.280]  junior year abroad in pakistan uh as a junior now he talked about being an international studies major
[02:26:32.280 --> 02:26:36.440]  here not a political science major all the international studies majors that are sure and
[02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:40.920]  that's the word i mean they sell people from brennan to him reportedly converted to a hobbyism
[02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:45.320]  and he wears that ring and the rest of it they say when he gave that first speech in cairo that he
[02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:49.400]  spoke better than major imams and so are you getting at the fact that he was radicalized in
[02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:55.000]  pakistan correct uh his affinity toward first of all his affinity toward islam his knowledge of islam
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:02.120]  of the culture the quran the uh all those terminology that he knows and just his cultural affinity and
[02:27:02.120 --> 02:27:07.480]  then backing uh at least 10 countries taken over by the jihadis out of saudi arabia in his eight
[02:27:07.480 --> 02:27:12.920]  years in office i mean this guy this guy has turned the world over to islam well his knowledge and
[02:27:12.920 --> 02:27:18.360]  affinity for islam reflects someone who spent time in a muslim country as an adult now not just
[02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:23.880]  indonesia not as a child in indonesia so his mother was he did go to madrasa in indonesia
[02:27:23.880 --> 02:27:28.840]  when he was a small child but uh his mother was living in pakistan at the time and i'm gonna now
[02:27:28.840 --> 02:27:33.720]  reveal my conversation with peter geithner peter geithner was head of the ford foundation
[02:27:33.720 --> 02:27:38.440]  in asia he lived in hong kong you talked to geithner this is huge correct peter geithner who
[02:27:38.440 --> 02:27:43.400]  unfortunately passed away just recently he's the father of timothy geithner the former treasury
[02:27:43.400 --> 02:27:49.800]  secretary for for barack obama what a coincidence no the ford foundation runs the whole globalist
[02:27:49.800 --> 02:27:55.640]  left his takeover and they're part of big part of columbia university as well so uh peter geithner
[02:27:55.640 --> 02:28:00.440]  met andanum she was andanum's he was andanum's boss uh when she worked for the foreign foundation
[02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:08.040]  in indonesia and peter told me that barack had a ford foundation scholarship this is big news uh
[02:28:08.040 --> 02:28:15.000]  to go to columbia and he also said it was for the senior year so this what this reveals a
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:18.760]  couple of things number one how do you get people to talk to you how'd you get geithner's dad to
[02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:23.640]  talk to you i just called him up i would like to say maybe it's uh the charm jerry course he says
[02:28:23.640 --> 02:28:28.520]  it's the long hair but uh you figure on the phone he wouldn't know about that but i've just always
[02:28:28.520 --> 02:28:32.680]  been honest and sincere and i say i got a problem can you help me with this and this i want to tell
[02:28:32.680 --> 02:28:38.840]  you why this is so significant number one because andanum obama's mother worked for the ford foundation
[02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:43.560]  it would have been illegal and they have very strong laws against nepotism for obama to get a
[02:28:44.200 --> 02:28:48.600]  ford foundation scholarship to columbia would have been illegal and i think this explains why
[02:28:48.600 --> 02:28:53.320]  obama was a ghost at columbia first of all i think it was only the other senior year and that's why
[02:28:53.320 --> 02:28:58.440]  he didn't join all these organizations and was a well-known person like he was at occidental and
[02:28:58.440 --> 02:29:04.760]  harvard uh obama's half-sister maya went to barnard by the way she's also a ghost you can't find her
[02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:10.920]  in any of the yearbooks photos nothing anyway geithner said he had a ford foundation scholarship
[02:29:10.920 --> 02:29:18.760]  now so halle siddiqui was the pakistani waiter who he was a roommate of with obama 109th street in
[02:29:18.760 --> 02:29:23.560]  east side there is and siddiqui told me that obama came to new york for the first time
[02:29:23.560 --> 02:29:29.560]  uh just showed up uh and called him to be because he needed a place to stay again that's the senior
[02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:33.800]  year so there's a lot of evidence that shows that obama was never there for the junior year
[02:29:33.800 --> 02:29:39.240]  sure the guy's got a total cia sheep dip from birth and a whole clandestine operation we're
[02:29:39.240 --> 02:29:42.840]  gonna come back and take phone calls with joel gilbert hits some other breaking news i'm alex
[02:29:42.840 --> 02:29:47.480]  shones info wars dot com is under attack they're openly having the e u announced they want us banned

[02:30:00.040 --> 02:30:06.360]  the web giants at youtube facebook twitter and microsoft have announced that they are stepping

[02:30:14.040 --> 02:30:21.640]  censor fake news within 24 hours meanwhile the fake news controversy is being exploited by the
[02:30:21.640 --> 02:30:28.200]  mainstream media to characterize completely legitimate alternative news sources for example cbs
[02:30:28.200 --> 02:30:34.680]  news just listed info wars as a fake news website and that's because the mainstream establishment
[02:30:34.680 --> 02:30:40.600]  media is losing all credibility with the american people and it was alternative and social media
[02:30:40.600 --> 02:30:46.040]  who helped donald trump win the presidential election so now the globalist battle plan is
[02:30:46.040 --> 02:30:51.880]  to indoctrinate the masses into only accepting the establishment viewpoint of what they want

[02:38:29.240 --> 02:38:33.480]  into major obstacles they're losing the hearts and minds so now they're panicking and wanting to
[02:38:33.480 --> 02:38:40.280]  censor us so i'm very excited this is happening i'm very honored this is historical but at the same
[02:38:40.280 --> 02:38:46.840]  time joel gilbert it still is scary to confirm wow these people really are criminals the toll
[02:38:46.840 --> 02:38:52.760]  free number to join us he's got more revelations for some calls on the censorship on what will
[02:38:52.760 --> 02:38:58.280]  obama pull his last 44 days in office what do you make of the recount now it's 70 plus thousand
[02:38:58.280 --> 02:39:04.920]  it's up on info wars dot com more people in wisconsin more more votes that he got is only a few
[02:39:04.920 --> 02:39:10.520]  thousand for hillary so hillary's lost 70 something thousand but gained a couple thousand
[02:39:11.880 --> 02:39:16.520]  think about that so overall she's lost 70 000 ladies and gentlemen so it turns out it was
[02:39:16.520 --> 02:39:21.000]  trump that was having the vote stolen it's it was all for hillary the scheme for hillary
[02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:29.320]  isn't that surprising toll free number to join us 800 25 at 99 231 800 25 at 99 231
[02:39:30.360 --> 02:39:34.760]  people ask why i'm so excited why have so much energy when you realize how criminal the global
[02:39:34.760 --> 02:39:40.840]  star how they're out to get us how they have true criminal energy and you realize how close they are
[02:39:40.840 --> 02:39:45.480]  to getting the supreme court how close they are to fully butchering our borders and bringing in
[02:39:45.480 --> 02:39:50.920]  even greater tyranny and indoctrinating our kids they've already gone so far to see the tide turning
[02:39:50.920 --> 02:39:56.040]  to know we're really starting to beat them to know we could really turn things around and then
[02:39:56.040 --> 02:40:01.320]  export freedom via ideology 1776 worldwide is so exciting and i'll tell you something
[02:40:03.080 --> 02:40:07.240]  we were talking uh to last a few weeks ago general flint's son who's one of his aides
[02:40:07.800 --> 02:40:10.920]  and he's talking about the media demonizing him and attacking him and taking out of context
[02:40:10.920 --> 02:40:15.320]  what he's tweeted what his dad's tweeted who's going to be his new national security advisor
[02:40:17.080 --> 02:40:24.360]  and the media makes a big deal out of his son tweeting about the pedestrian emails and about
[02:40:24.360 --> 02:40:30.040]  all the weird spirit cooking and occult stuff and mention of weird code words and so they conflate
[02:40:30.040 --> 02:40:33.800]  that moving into oh he's attacking some poor pizza place when that's only a small part of
[02:40:33.800 --> 02:40:37.880]  pizza gate and i said look just double down they're the old dinosaur media they're falling
[02:40:37.880 --> 02:40:42.040]  apart great job and i saw him the last few days just saying there needs to be an investigation
[02:40:42.040 --> 02:40:45.960]  of all these places there needs to be an investigation and i agree because it's bill
[02:40:45.960 --> 02:40:51.560]  clinton on the plane dozens of times with the convicted pedophile going to a pedophile slave
[02:40:51.560 --> 02:40:55.960]  island and going to sheiks that are known pedophiles and it's it's it's it's all these globalists
[02:40:55.960 --> 02:41:00.440]  caught doing this and so if this is in emails we're not saying everybody in there's guilty of
[02:41:00.440 --> 02:41:04.520]  something we're saying it should be investigated and for the media to now come out and imply that
[02:41:04.520 --> 02:41:09.160]  there aren't pedophile networks period and claim that's fake they're going to feel real
[02:41:09.160 --> 02:41:13.960]  stupid as more pen states come out and as more catholic stuff comes out and as more of this
[02:41:13.960 --> 02:41:19.800]  unfolds that the fact that the left is using pedophilia as a way to infiltrate like spies do
[02:41:19.800 --> 02:41:26.040]  and take over society so 800 25 at 99231 is the number joel gilbert filmmaker of joel
[02:41:26.040 --> 02:41:31.880]  gilbert dot net's here he has dropped more than 10 major bombshells he's down to the last few
[02:41:31.880 --> 02:41:37.160]  right now in his in-depth long-term investigations the things he's never released on obama
[02:41:37.160 --> 02:41:41.480]  he's gleaned the last few years now that obama is about to go into private action against us
[02:41:42.120 --> 02:41:46.600]  joel gilbert is dropping these truth bombs let's get into the nose job yeah the last one of the
[02:41:46.600 --> 02:41:53.160]  last ones here had this in my film but we've got more information and this is just a part of obama
[02:41:53.160 --> 02:41:59.240]  trying to hide the fact that his real biological father an ideological mentor was a soviet agent
[02:41:59.240 --> 02:42:03.800]  an american communist he ran for president saying my father's a goat herder i'm going to bring us
[02:42:03.800 --> 02:42:08.600]  all together had we known the truth had he said my father was a soviet agent who wanted to destroy
[02:42:08.600 --> 02:42:13.000]  america and helped the soviet union during the cold war we never would have elected and we would
[02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:19.880]  not have suffered these eight years of obama's fake presidency the nose job was a way that
[02:42:19.880 --> 02:42:25.720]  obama could hide his stark resemblance to his real father frank marshall davis we had plastic
[02:42:25.720 --> 02:42:31.400]  surgeons look at this it's on the website they testified to it obama had a exact frank more
[02:42:31.400 --> 02:42:36.680]  marshall davis a larger nose i believe he also had a lower lip job which we haven't verified with
[02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:42.120]  plastic surgeons so they made his nose narrower they made it all it clearly did smaller and narrower
[02:42:42.120 --> 02:42:47.880]  because he looks so much like frank marshall davis uh any connection to davis would have
[02:42:47.880 --> 02:42:53.720]  eliminated him yeah they took the bump off his nose they they made it a lot less wide correct so he
[02:42:53.720 --> 02:42:59.640]  still to this day looks almost exactly like davis but the nose really really uh told a story and uh
[02:42:59.640 --> 02:43:03.880]  this when did he get the nose job i mean but 1990 clearly he still had his regular nose i believe
[02:43:03.880 --> 02:43:09.000]  he had one in 2003 and he may have had several because it just every time it gets a little bigger
[02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:13.240]  it kind of starts to get smaller so it's quite obvious and there's plastic surgeons on my website
[02:43:13.240 --> 02:43:18.040]  that are very well well known nationally that have a tendency to see the bi-sectional line down the
[02:43:18.040 --> 02:43:23.480]  middle yeah so all of uh he was he the scar that lords you see the scar right there yeah oh i'm
[02:43:23.480 --> 02:43:27.640]  the lower lip you can see a scar also if you look closely his lower lip does not match the upper lip
[02:43:27.640 --> 02:43:30.600]  when you see him in photos well it's like michael jackson he'll be proud of how he looked i think
[02:43:30.600 --> 02:43:35.240]  he looked better before i think so too you know but the spitting image of frank marshall davis
[02:43:35.240 --> 02:43:42.200]  would reveal an ideology that he did come from a hard left communist background and had no intention
[02:43:42.200 --> 02:43:47.960]  of serving america instead it was to serve this leftist ideology which wants to throw open the
[02:43:47.960 --> 02:43:54.280]  borders legalized drugs diminish america's place in the world you know here's where i don't say we
[02:43:54.280 --> 02:43:58.920]  differ i don't like the drug culture i know it's destructive but then the police state that comes
[02:43:58.920 --> 02:44:04.040]  out of throwing nonviolent people in jail for using drugs is another evil i'm for decriminalization i
[02:44:04.040 --> 02:44:07.720]  don't think we like like liquor whatever just shouldn't be everywhere i get sorrows just pushing
[02:44:07.720 --> 02:44:11.880]  because the new weed is so strong it puts you in a little you know catatonic fetal position
[02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:17.720]  and i understand the drug culture is part of what the left pushes but a lot of areas of europe
[02:44:17.720 --> 02:44:22.840]  have decriminalized it's made drug use actually go down look i visited uh obama's best friend
[02:44:22.840 --> 02:44:27.640]  keith in prison and uh i i saw a lot of people there for drug offenses keith himself has been in
[02:44:27.640 --> 02:44:34.040]  and out of jail's whole life for for drug offenses and uh i think uh once you go in there and see
[02:44:34.040 --> 02:44:39.000]  that these people just kind of wasting away he is in a treatment center it's a substance abuse
[02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:44.040]  center there i am in corkland state prison in the photo if you're watching on tv uh it is a
[02:44:44.040 --> 02:44:50.120]  a treatment center but he does complain though that since uh obama's uh pushed to to help
[02:44:50.120 --> 02:44:56.200]  transsexuals that many many prisoners are now transgender and transsexual and he finds it
[02:44:56.200 --> 02:45:01.480]  very difficult to live in an environment where well what they do is i mean i mean they get kids
[02:45:01.480 --> 02:45:04.600]  and they confuse them when they're younger prisoners you know guys they're in they're doing it and
[02:45:04.600 --> 02:45:08.760]  it's just they push it and it's all part of the dehumanization i'm not against anybody that really
[02:45:08.760 --> 02:45:12.360]  thinks they're a man or a woman or whatever i'm a libertarian but clearly it's it's being pushed
[02:45:12.360 --> 02:45:16.920]  as an agenda that's that's the complaint and it's in the prison system as well that's what
[02:45:16.920 --> 02:45:19.960]  i found out well look at the political correctness i want to go to some phone calls i have a whole
[02:45:19.960 --> 02:45:24.120]  stack on this that i mentioned earlier where there's attacks on whites everywhere the media has been
[02:45:24.120 --> 02:45:29.960]  caught uh covering it up uh we've got uh women that are killed by his long assist in germany
[02:45:29.960 --> 02:45:34.520]  and the police cover it up uh report buried trump related hate crimes against white kids
[02:45:35.160 --> 02:45:38.600]  german state media refuses to run migrant murder story says it's too regional
[02:45:38.600 --> 02:45:44.600]  well trump supporter has his truck torches free with any trump slogans and when cnn does cover
[02:45:44.600 --> 02:45:49.400]  this they'll have reporters on the well so what they're white or well cops are bad won't stop getting
[02:45:49.400 --> 02:45:55.240]  killed stop being bad cops since when if again a cop does something wrong in another state you
[02:45:55.240 --> 02:46:00.920]  go shoot another cop in the back of the head i mean it's just crazy look uh there's obama's
[02:46:00.920 --> 02:46:06.840]  radical agenda is obviously revealed in the fact that he never came out ever and simply said
[02:46:06.840 --> 02:46:14.120]  folks do not do drugs you're and do not carry weapons do not attack the police did we ever hear
[02:46:14.120 --> 02:46:18.440]  obama say anything of that nature all right we should take some phone calls here who's been
[02:46:18.440 --> 02:46:25.240]  holding the longest let's go to chris in virginia you're on the air with joe gilbert go ahead move
[02:46:25.240 --> 02:46:35.080]  bitch get out the way i do a hundred on the highway yeah i just wanted to talk about um i've seen
[02:46:35.080 --> 02:46:43.560]  today uh japan uh japan did uh 50 000 jobs to come into america and then along with the
[02:46:44.360 --> 02:46:51.480]  uh the phone call from taiwan and you know what in good relations with russia i was wondering if
[02:46:51.480 --> 02:46:56.520]  that was a plan all along to form that kind of alliance to put a pressure on china your thoughts
[02:46:57.640 --> 02:47:02.520]  i'm glad you mentioned that because i saw that news today just the president so respected that
[02:47:02.520 --> 02:47:07.240]  office so powerful even though american power has been destroyed by on purpose by globalists
[02:47:07.240 --> 02:47:12.360]  even though our name's been trashed by globalists still back when we were a quasi-free country we're
[02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:17.560]  so loved and so respected the japanese respect the fact we you know they started the fight we dominated
[02:47:17.560 --> 02:47:21.880]  i'm not saying all the war was good but the point is they started it that yes they're announcing
[02:47:21.880 --> 02:47:27.560]  50 000 jobs to the united states and new things they're going to build new factories uh we've got
[02:47:27.560 --> 02:47:31.800]  new companies saying they're going to stay here like carrier ford said we'll bring all our plans
[02:47:31.800 --> 02:47:37.080]  back if you just make the federal income tax of the state tax the same here is in his other parts
[02:47:37.080 --> 02:47:41.880]  of the world now the media is calling that crony capitalism the fake heritage foundation no it's
[02:47:41.880 --> 02:47:47.800]  not free trade to have one-sided deals we should have the global average uh corporate income tax
[02:47:47.800 --> 02:47:53.880]  if we wanted to be free trade so again a bunch of cheating deals is wrong and japan gets they
[02:47:53.880 --> 02:48:00.520]  need trading partners so yes china gets the signal from trump to stand up to china absolutely
[02:48:00.520 --> 02:48:05.160]  deliciously and is now making all these pro u.s uh statements and things and he really
[02:48:05.160 --> 02:48:09.800]  allying with russia uh because he's becoming more christian more free market uh alliling
[02:48:09.800 --> 02:48:14.280]  with japan allying with south korea suddenly the philippines president that hated obama had no
[02:48:14.280 --> 02:48:19.880]  respect now says he has total respect for trump they folks they have respect for trump and when
[02:48:19.880 --> 02:48:24.760]  he stood up to the chinese communists last week that was another feather in his cap joel gilbert
[02:48:24.760 --> 02:48:31.320]  yeah trump has uh clearly in two weeks of being president elect or three uh accomplish more than
[02:48:31.880 --> 02:48:35.800]  just by trying with a couple of phone calls here and there's accomplished more than obama
[02:48:35.800 --> 02:48:40.520]  ever has in in eight years uh on behalf of the american worker and behalf of the american people
[02:48:40.520 --> 02:48:45.160]  economically instead of giving it away uh trump is uh trying to bring it back to the united state
[02:48:45.160 --> 02:48:47.960]  and by the way i was going to make a theme song but it's a family show so i didn't do it with the
[02:48:47.960 --> 02:48:51.880]  ludicrous i'll admit i like you know some of the really good hip hop a lot of it's just repetitive
[02:48:51.880 --> 02:48:55.800]  guards but i mean there's some good songs uh from ludicrous and and the funny i learned
[02:48:55.800 --> 02:48:59.560]  he was like a conservative i didn't know that but i was going to use a theme song but i didn't do it
[02:48:59.560 --> 02:49:04.680]  of move you know what get out the way i'm doing a hundred on the highway so you best get the you
[02:49:04.680 --> 02:49:08.840]  know it out of my way but i use the analogy of almost every person i saw with a hillary or bernie
[02:49:08.840 --> 02:49:14.840]  sander if i'm going on the highway at 70 it's a 75 mile an hour i see a 50 mile an hour standstill
[02:49:14.840 --> 02:49:21.640]  it's always literally an old lady or somebody or a white trendy in a bmw with a liberal sticker
[02:49:21.640 --> 02:49:29.240]  driving 55 and a 70 they love arrogantly holding everybody back they love shitting in people's way
[02:49:29.240 --> 02:49:32.840]  they love or is it just they're totally oblivious i mean have you noticed that
[02:49:33.640 --> 02:49:39.960]  uh it's about control they can control other people with their ideology so they crave it they crave
[02:49:39.960 --> 02:49:44.040]  get out of the fast lane man it's for me you're supposed to go around in that i don't care if
[02:49:44.040 --> 02:49:49.640]  i'm doing a hundred when i go i get over once i've gone around somebody dumbass you're not supposed
[02:49:49.640 --> 02:49:55.880]  to my litmus test is that someone drives slow in the fast lane i think it should be punishable by death
[02:49:56.760 --> 02:50:02.680]  well uh look i'm joking yeah i know well uh look that's the uh the mentality of the liberals is
[02:50:02.680 --> 02:50:07.240]  find ways to control society so they can impose their ideology on everyone else exactly christ
[02:50:07.240 --> 02:50:13.480]  you made some great points anything else uh yes and what is going on with these people that are so
[02:50:13.480 --> 02:50:20.360]  ingrained in them that russia somehow is in their dna to want to overtake us why can't russia
[02:50:20.360 --> 02:50:25.160]  let's go left us in new york and in london took over the czarist empire in 1917 and set it up as a
[02:50:25.160 --> 02:50:30.920]  great engine of evil and so it's just been drummed into us for 70 years and uh now you know the rush
[02:50:30.920 --> 02:50:34.840]  is less leftist than then obama i'm saying rush is perfect but they're a lot better than communist

[02:54:22.920 --> 02:54:27.640]  they can let me see but obviously i can't talk about it yet when will this stuff come out uh
[02:54:27.640 --> 02:54:32.280]  look uh we got to see what's going to happen is Hillary gonna if she's investigated and they do a
[02:54:32.280 --> 02:54:39.480]  full investigation of uh the clinton foundation the emails uh i'll have uh some information to pass
[02:54:39.480 --> 02:54:45.000]  on that way all i can say is clearly she's had people killed and they call that fake news give
[02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:51.080]  me a break the the wake of death behind them it's just is just ultra massive it's it makes
[02:54:51.080 --> 02:54:56.440]  scarface you look like a cupcake uh the stuff you were telling me some pretty dang pretty dangerous
[02:54:56.440 --> 02:55:02.440]  stuff well we've uh we saw some things with uh you had danny williams on i produced that uh
[02:55:02.440 --> 02:55:07.640]  film called banished and we saw how danny was treated uh people didn't quite i didn't quite
[02:55:07.640 --> 02:55:12.440]  put it all together till after i shot the film with danny that he was put in a foster home
[02:55:12.440 --> 02:55:19.320]  home when obama was running for reelection in 1995 so 1992 uh the story comes out that danny
[02:55:19.320 --> 02:55:23.800]  williams is bill clinton's black son and has been banished by hillary and they kind of kill it
[02:55:24.360 --> 02:55:28.840]  story is killed nine months before clinton is running for reelection the state of arkansas
[02:55:28.840 --> 02:55:32.920]  grabs him out of his aunt's house where he's living normally because the real headline is clinton had
[02:55:32.920 --> 02:55:37.720]  his son kidnapped and thrown basically in prison to shut him up put him in foster homes and all
[02:55:37.720 --> 02:55:41.240]  of a sudden three or four months after the election let him go back and live with his aunt
[02:55:41.240 --> 02:55:46.520]  now what could be more heinous and cruel than uh throwing this kid into a foster home what do you
[02:55:46.520 --> 02:55:51.480]  make of all the pedophile stuff i mean clearly clinton flew dozens of times on that plane uh to
[02:55:51.480 --> 02:55:55.800]  that pedophile island clearly they fly to the chic's house to deliver a million dollar checks and
[02:55:55.800 --> 02:56:01.000]  stuff i mean why does this keep popping up the boys town the you know all this look we don't know
[02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:04.920]  if this is just the tip of the iceberg where i read what you read that hillary went there six
[02:56:04.920 --> 02:56:09.720]  times and we don't we don't know we eric prince has the big connections and he says it's all real
[02:56:09.720 --> 02:56:15.000]  remains to be seen if uh trump is willing to uh investigate this and get the truth out
[02:56:15.560 --> 02:56:20.600]  and i i think it's important to reveal obama's true history and true legacy what he was up to these
[02:56:20.600 --> 02:56:25.480]  eight years what the clintons were doing who their friends were because we need to move forward we
[02:56:25.480 --> 02:56:31.080]  can't wait in four or five or you know four eight years come back with uh you know julian castrow
[02:56:31.080 --> 02:56:35.240]  with uh chelsea clinton as the vice president sure sure and they're going to destroy everything
[02:56:35.240 --> 02:56:39.320]  that we've tried to that's right trump has to reverse all this and deliver steve and texas
[02:56:39.320 --> 02:56:47.240]  you're on the year with joe gilbert hi mr gilbert um i think i was talking to the call screener while
[02:56:47.240 --> 02:56:54.680]  you were mentioning the uh very obvious head wound that obama had that appears to have been
[02:56:54.680 --> 02:56:59.320]  stitched up were you mentioning that i never mentioned that uh he said that i think in his
[02:56:59.320 --> 02:57:06.280]  book that he fell out of a tree when he was in uh a child in indonesia so you know that that really
[02:57:06.280 --> 02:57:12.360]  doesn't bother me that much uh i think uh i've covered a great deal of depth in but i mean who
[02:57:12.360 --> 02:57:17.400]  has four or five identities by the time you're ten and this guy is just amazing steve what's your
[02:57:17.400 --> 02:57:30.440]  point uh well from dreams for my father it on page 377 and on page 372 obama mentions going back
[02:57:30.440 --> 02:57:36.520]  to the lao tribe which if and and i know you're trying to make a case for frank davis marshall
[02:57:36.520 --> 02:57:43.880]  being his father i think he certainly was the one that raised barack a berry but i really think uh
[02:57:44.520 --> 02:57:49.880]  he is somehow connected with that lao tribe now okay well let me comment that look the luau
[02:57:49.880 --> 02:57:55.880]  tribe in kenya is what the kenyan obama family was part of malik obama you may have seen my
[02:57:55.880 --> 02:58:01.560]  interview with his alleged half-brother malik uh seems pretty convinced he wants a dna test
[02:58:01.560 --> 02:58:07.960]  he seems pretty convinced that uh barack is probably not uh his biological brother i think
[02:58:07.960 --> 02:58:13.800]  he does consider him a brother because he's been his brother for so many years but the kenyan family
[02:58:13.800 --> 02:58:17.720]  i think a long time ago and especially malik who was they've just owned him all right we're out of
[02:58:17.720 --> 02:58:21.080]  time there thank you steve i'm gonna move quick with collars when we come back for five minutes
[02:58:21.080 --> 02:58:26.600]  bam bam bam uh julie and therese and a few others and then paul watson at eight after when they come
[02:58:26.600 --> 02:58:32.280]  back takes over from london england he's got big news on open announcement they're moving forward
[02:58:32.280 --> 02:58:37.880]  now saying they want to ban thousands of websites and they name info wars by name that means shutting
[02:58:37.880 --> 02:58:41.960]  you up and of course it's the e you and the internet has conveniently been handed over
[02:58:41.960 --> 02:58:46.840]  october 1st to the international consortium it's all happening we told you it was coming because
[02:58:46.840 --> 02:58:51.400]  we're the fake news but we're so on target so cutting edges and growing so fast the new product

[02:59:04.200 --> 02:59:09.480]  mustard seed extract when you take selenium in the body it actually benefits the detoxification
[02:59:09.480 --> 02:59:15.720]  systems in your body it helps balance the thyroid gland it helps detoxify selenium is another one
[02:59:15.720 --> 02:59:21.160]  of those absolute must-haves the highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland but it's
[02:59:21.160 --> 02:59:27.080]  actually used all over the body as a matter of fact there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[02:59:27.080 --> 02:59:34.280]  dependent upon selenium so it really is a all around nutrient that everybody really needs i'm

[03:00:12.440 --> 03:00:19.880]  he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're listening to alex
[03:00:19.880 --> 03:00:24.040]  jones look i don't get up here and tell you how big info wars has gotten that powerful i get up
[03:00:24.040 --> 03:00:28.200]  here to point out how pathetic the mainstream media is that we filled this vacuum along with drudge
[03:00:28.200 --> 03:00:33.240]  and others but they're coming after us and and and the paradigm has shifted so big they just
[03:00:33.240 --> 03:00:39.320]  can't believe that you know i get calls from the president uh i mean if they knew the type of calls
[03:00:39.320 --> 03:00:44.200]  they'd really freak out and jump off a cliff but these are weirdos that want power want to run our
[03:00:44.200 --> 03:00:48.280]  lives want to drive slow in the fast lane is you know the litmus test that's why those of us that
[03:00:48.280 --> 03:00:53.320]  don't want power we have to get involved and take political power to give it back to the people
[03:00:53.320 --> 03:00:58.120]  or we're going to be enslaved good people always leave this vacuum for bad people and i think there's
[03:00:58.120 --> 03:01:01.560]  a global awakening happening right now and that's changing but i cannot express enough to you the
[03:01:01.560 --> 03:01:05.800]  listeners of viewers you're the reason this is happening and i want to salute you people like
[03:01:05.800 --> 03:01:11.640]  joe gilbert and others it's just amazing you can find both his films at joe gilbert dot net
[03:01:11.640 --> 03:01:15.880]  you can find one of his films we sell at info wars store dot com julie in new jersey you're on the
[03:01:15.880 --> 03:01:23.320]  air go ahead alex love your show i i'm from chicago originally so you can imagine you know that none
[03:01:23.320 --> 03:01:28.440]  of this surprises me with what your guest is talking about today you know and i feel like there's been
[03:01:28.440 --> 03:01:33.400]  this slow burn agenda you know almost to the point where we can't really even go to sleep at night
[03:01:33.400 --> 03:01:36.920]  because we can't trust what they're going to have up their sleeve next my question to you
[03:01:37.640 --> 03:01:44.040]  is what can we do with one voice because my concern is worst-case scenario what's our plan
[03:01:44.040 --> 03:01:50.200]  be where do we go from here well i mean we're beginning to win because we're finally getting
[03:01:50.200 --> 03:01:53.720]  up off our butts and taking action the ideology we're pushing is why everybody wanted to come to
[03:01:53.720 --> 03:01:57.880]  america we never even realized tenth of what america do but just that little bit of renaissance
[03:01:57.880 --> 03:02:02.520]  i harp on changed the whole world so we just go back to what's proven to totally win they want to
[03:02:02.520 --> 03:02:07.720]  shut down the american system because they can't compete with it if hillary had won and uh trump
[03:02:07.720 --> 03:02:13.880]  only won by one percent here one percent there how close this was we would be living now in the
[03:02:13.880 --> 03:02:20.760]  liberal fascist apocalypse with a supreme court and they had already said alt right which they define
[03:02:20.760 --> 03:02:25.160]  because they're god is is is going to be discredited in the hillary landslide we're going to shut you
[03:02:25.160 --> 03:02:29.320]  down for your lives we take over they were planning to come after us whether they lost her one the
[03:02:29.320 --> 03:02:34.040]  crazy part is they're going to try to shut us down while we have the president correct but uh and
[03:02:34.040 --> 03:02:40.200]  look they're looking to the eu and the un to do it this is the beginning i think of the counter
[03:02:40.200 --> 03:02:46.840]  revolution against this leftist globalist agenda and uh alex i thank you for doing your part all
[03:02:46.840 --> 03:02:50.600]  this time you really have had an impact well joe i don't mean to be ranting but isn't it surreal
[03:02:50.600 --> 03:02:56.760]  to you i know you always said they do this but they really do want to shut us up the only way
[03:02:56.760 --> 03:03:02.760]  they can succeed is by shutting people up because uh any amount of information that tells the truth
[03:03:02.760 --> 03:03:08.600]  unemployment is not four percent under barack obama it's about 20 percent uh on and on the
[03:03:08.600 --> 03:03:15.000]  deficit is is uh you know 20 trillion and growing any amount of truth about the reality of we have
[03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:19.000]  all these people coming across the border pretending to be children think how whacked out they are
[03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:23.400]  though they are so scared to know full well that at least one of trump's sons listen flin listens
[03:03:23.400 --> 03:03:27.880]  i don't want to get into it all the time his son all bunch of his leadership listens not that i
[03:03:27.880 --> 03:03:31.720]  invented any of this i just kind of rediscovered america and promoted it the point is it's just
[03:03:31.720 --> 03:03:37.000]  this show alone has the president's ear they are crapping their pants joe yeah i think it's any
[03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:42.440]  information that illuminates and shows what they're really up to which simply says the basic facts
[03:03:42.440 --> 03:03:45.800]  that they've been presenting to us and shoving down our throat through the uh
[03:03:45.800 --> 03:03:50.840]  press office of the white house uh all this fake news they've been generating for eight years
[03:03:50.840 --> 03:03:55.480]  is false and i think uh the american sure they're the fake news other answers shut us down
[03:03:55.480 --> 03:03:59.000]  terese in california last color i have time to go to apologize the others
[03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:05.880]  watson's coming up terese go ahead hi alex what a privilege to finally talk to you pleasure to talk
[03:04:05.880 --> 03:04:12.520]  to you yeah yeah so um okay you was just talking about the art contest this morning
[03:04:13.560 --> 03:04:18.120]  yes i was i'm not doing an art contest on this where this cartoon where trump is throwing the
[03:04:18.120 --> 03:04:22.120]  ball over the mainstream media of the american people via social media so now they want to shut
[03:04:22.120 --> 03:04:28.280]  that down as fake news seem like an art contest along this line because i already have uh
[03:04:28.280 --> 03:04:34.920]  something i want to submit your your contest i had an idea for you send it in rather than give away
[03:04:34.920 --> 03:04:44.520]  29 grand to the contest winners how about if you make it so that whoever wins can be invited to a
[03:04:44.520 --> 03:04:50.040]  christmas party that you have for you and your staff so we can meet you know that'd be fun we
[03:04:50.040 --> 03:04:53.240]  could do so i just want to give you i didn't say 29 grand i think i said like five grand or something
[03:04:53.240 --> 03:04:57.000]  but i know i hear you it's a great idea i just want to get you the people that are powerful

[03:08:38.440 --> 03:08:44.200]  the morning program morning joe on cnbc saying we're delusional and hallucinating but there's
[03:08:44.200 --> 03:08:49.800]  any pedophilia with the clinton's jerry eppstein any of it none of it exists and then we've got
[03:08:49.800 --> 03:08:55.480]  articles where germany won't allow articles to run about migrants raping and killing people
[03:08:56.520 --> 03:09:03.320]  german state media refuses to run migrant murder story says it's too regional and then it comes out
[03:09:03.320 --> 03:09:08.920]  police have been ordered to say it's blonde hair germans raping when it happens sweden too and here's
[03:09:08.920 --> 03:09:15.960]  the editorial cartoon i tweeted earlier today that says it all it's trump walking outside and he
[03:09:15.960 --> 03:09:21.880]  throws a ball a football that says social media over the heads of the mainstream media like monkey

[03:09:48.120 --> 03:09:54.120]  com and bright bart dot com and then now they're saying drudge report dot com which is just a bunch
[03:09:54.120 --> 03:09:58.680]  of links 95 of the time drudge breaks a lot of exclusive stuff but that's like once a week or
[03:09:58.680 --> 03:10:02.040]  something where they put up an exclusive about something developing or breaking it's all just
[03:10:02.040 --> 03:10:06.120]  about interesting news to say hey look at this mainstream alternative you name it i thought they
[03:10:06.120 --> 03:10:13.160]  wouldn't be bold enough to add that because he's mainly linking to them but no no no no you must
[03:10:13.160 --> 03:10:21.560]  only go to them dying media in such a desperate position now openly saying this and finally
[03:10:21.560 --> 03:10:26.520]  the new story that dub tells with the german media censoring the islamist is killing women

[03:11:05.400 --> 03:11:09.800]  prompted uproar in germany with the country currently suffering expansion of rapes and violent
[03:11:09.800 --> 03:11:14.840]  crimes since its borders were opened and they admit that it's what happens in these islamic
[03:11:14.840 --> 03:11:20.440]  countries that a woman unattended not wearing a burqa can be raped but no one ever gets islam
[03:11:20.440 --> 03:11:25.560]  to apologize for that it's all we've got to submit to them and he's been arrested he's reportedly
[03:11:25.560 --> 03:11:28.440]  confessed he hasn't been convicted yet i was reading another story here of a new convicted

[03:14:25.960 --> 03:14:31.880]  here as the victory is happening we're right here as you can see history changing as you can see the
[03:14:31.880 --> 03:14:37.560]  tide turning it's such an amazing time so spread the word a sign up for the newsletter i've said

[03:14:42.360 --> 03:14:46.360]  deals that save you the biggest discounts there are so we can stay in contact back in the golden age
[03:14:46.360 --> 03:14:50.040]  of email i never tried to get emails i never tried to do it for marketing i just didn't care
[03:14:50.040 --> 03:14:54.040]  but we'd have 10 million email lists instead of a million and which is a pathetic number for
[03:14:54.040 --> 03:14:57.240]  our biggest audience who says nobody does email now i've been told by all the experts about two
[03:14:57.240 --> 03:15:01.320]  years ago they said listen you're going to get censored in the future you need email because
[03:15:01.320 --> 03:15:06.040]  it's almost impossible to block that you need direct contact with your people they can kick
[03:15:06.040 --> 03:15:09.720]  you off apps they can do all this that model's coming because i know folks that have been the
[03:15:09.720 --> 03:15:14.440]  big consortium meetings the plan is to do this you now see it if people aren't signed up at info
[03:15:14.440 --> 03:15:21.160]  wars dot com four slash newsletter they're crazy they are crazy we need people to be signed up there

[03:15:28.520 --> 03:15:33.320]  that maybe even tonight i'm gonna shoot videos on it this is matt this is paul watson i'm gonna get
[03:15:33.320 --> 03:15:36.440]  out of here because you know you're a hard guy to get to even come on the area you're so busy
[03:15:36.440 --> 03:15:40.600]  but i gotta tell you um we're gonna launch another big initiative tomorrow that we haven't
[03:15:40.600 --> 03:15:46.440]  gotten into yet as well but it's still to know this was coming a year ago when drudge told us
[03:15:46.440 --> 03:15:49.960]  and we can see the tea leaves as well but he had direct high level highest levels of the of the
[03:15:49.960 --> 03:15:55.960]  legislative excuse me of the judicial branch but to see them say you have 24 hours to shut down
[03:15:55.960 --> 03:16:04.120]  thousands of sites facebook twitter google and list us and to see all this this rollout of cbs nbc
[03:16:04.120 --> 03:16:11.400]  cnn msnbc cnbc saying shut us down by name uh they wouldn't be doing that if they didn't
[03:16:11.400 --> 03:16:15.160]  intend to shut us down because it's only going to make us bigger of course they realize we're a lot
[03:16:15.160 --> 03:16:20.120]  bigger than them but still we get their audience we convert people because we're just covering facts
[03:16:20.120 --> 03:16:25.720]  and common sense paul this is seismic this is canary in the coal mine we need to go to the next
[03:16:25.720 --> 03:16:32.200]  level and our listeners need to understand this is it paul well i mean they've moved on now you
[03:16:32.200 --> 03:16:37.320]  mentioned the article earlier they've basically recategorized this fake news they took it to
[03:16:37.320 --> 03:16:43.480]  the next level which is putting it in the same context as g haddist propaganda that's what the
[03:16:43.480 --> 03:16:47.720]  e you did with that announcement that's in the article today so they've moved on it's not just
[03:16:47.720 --> 03:16:52.280]  it's a chinese communist blacklist calling it fake news when they're the fake news take over
[03:16:52.280 --> 03:16:58.760]  watching okay so it's not just misleading now fake news is actually harmful it's going to
[03:16:58.760 --> 03:17:03.400]  cause violence people are going to kill in the name of fake news and that's what they launched
[03:17:03.400 --> 03:17:09.160]  with this pizza gate thing on sunday night again unfortunate incident no one got harmed the freak
[03:17:09.160 --> 03:17:15.560]  out was bigger than the ohio state islamic terror attack which of course they immediately
[03:17:15.560 --> 03:17:23.560]  brushed off and the fact is the media is responsible for inciting violence via fake news that's a
[03:17:23.560 --> 03:17:28.120]  fact and i've got several more examples of that today of course we don't need to talk about
[03:17:28.120 --> 03:17:34.280]  saddam hussein's non-existent weapons of mass destruction how that fake news caused hundreds
[03:17:34.280 --> 03:17:40.760]  of thousands of deaths thousands of dead us troops ruined the continent we had the media's hysteria
[03:17:40.760 --> 03:17:47.000]  all throughout the campaign cycle that donald trump was the next incarnation of hitler that he
[03:17:47.000 --> 03:17:53.080]  was going to destroy the world they were inciting violence with that narrative alone and you saw
[03:17:53.080 --> 03:18:00.440]  it at trump's rallies you saw it with the numerous assassination attempts against trump all based on
[03:18:00.440 --> 03:18:07.080]  the hysterical fake news narrative rhetoric that donald trump was the next hitler again you saw
[03:18:07.080 --> 03:18:12.920]  it at the dnc now we know through james oakheave project veritas that was funded that came from
[03:18:12.920 --> 03:18:19.880]  the very top you see it again today with a story we've got got up on info wars.com about cnn
[03:18:20.520 --> 03:18:26.600]  basically interviewing someone who expresses her fear that donald trump is going to put muslims
[03:18:26.600 --> 03:18:35.560]  in concentration camps and cnn gives that a serious platform again that is hysterical fake news
[03:18:35.560 --> 03:18:41.640]  and it is going to incite violence we saw the ohio state attacker what were his motives what was in
[03:18:41.640 --> 03:18:49.480]  his facebook post again concerns about islamophobia what has the media been pushing since before
[03:18:49.480 --> 03:18:55.720]  trump was elected for months and months and months phony fake news narratives about islamophobia
[03:18:55.720 --> 03:19:04.520]  that was his main motivation the islamic terrorist was motivated by fake news narrative hysteria
[03:19:04.520 --> 03:19:12.760]  pushed by the mainstream media not by info wars.com okay the mainstream media is inciting violence
[03:19:12.760 --> 03:19:21.560]  via fake news another example time magazine back in 2014 rioters the michael brown ferguson
[03:19:21.560 --> 03:19:28.440]  riots were happening they put out an article entitled ferguson in defense of rioting in
[03:19:28.440 --> 03:19:36.200]  which they pushed the fake news narrative of hands up don't chew again from the autopsy evidence
[03:19:36.200 --> 03:19:41.240]  we now know and in fact we knew very shortly afterwards he did not have his hands up yet
[03:19:41.240 --> 03:19:49.400]  they used that fake news narrative as a justification to incite to encourage illegal activity to
[03:19:49.400 --> 03:19:56.520]  encourage violence time magazine not info wars.com time magazine the mainstream media
[03:19:56.520 --> 03:20:01.640]  pushing fake news to incite violence will be back stay tuned will the government protect your

[03:24:07.160 --> 03:24:28.920]  the main stream media is inciting violence via its promotion of fake news again let's go through
[03:24:28.920 --> 03:24:35.160]  the examples they accuse us of encouraging violence through fake news with this pizza gate incident
[03:24:35.160 --> 03:24:41.000]  in which no one was hurt which they freaked out about 10 times more than an actual islamic terror
[03:24:41.000 --> 03:24:47.640]  attack at ohio state university think about this what about the electors who were receiving
[03:24:47.640 --> 03:24:54.600]  death threat after death threat from hillary clinton voters we've had several stories on that
[03:24:54.600 --> 03:25:01.320]  we have another one today where one of these electors literally gets 4 000 emails a day
[03:25:01.320 --> 03:25:08.200]  harassing him telling him not to vote for donald trump again others have received direct death
[03:25:08.200 --> 03:25:15.240]  threats why is that it's because the media is determined to delegitimize donald trump to claim
[03:25:15.240 --> 03:25:21.080]  that he illegitimately won the election we've seen that narrative immediately afterwards they
[03:25:21.080 --> 03:25:27.240]  legitimize the riots against the fair democratic victory of donald trump and look what they're
[03:25:27.240 --> 03:25:35.480]  doing now this is out of zero hedge time urges 65 million americans who voted for hillary not to
[03:25:35.480 --> 03:25:43.480]  pay taxes so again this is the same time magazine that during the riots in ferguson two years ago
[03:25:43.480 --> 03:25:50.280]  encouraged people to riot to loo to commit violent criminal behavior by putting out an article
[03:25:50.280 --> 03:25:58.920]  entitled ferguson in defense of rioting now they're encouraging 65 million americans not to pay
[03:25:58.920 --> 03:26:06.680]  taxes to break the law because the election wasn't fair because hillary won the popular vote she
[03:26:06.680 --> 03:26:12.040]  didn't win the electoral vote which were the rules agreed upon going into the election as they have
[03:26:12.040 --> 03:26:17.960]  been throughout history but no boohoo that wasn't fair we're but her about it so now this individual
[03:26:17.960 --> 03:26:25.480]  mark weston the headline of the time magazine article is 65 million americans should threaten
[03:26:25.480 --> 03:26:32.280]  to not pay taxes now in many states as far as i understand it that is actually a criminal offense
[03:26:32.280 --> 03:26:37.880]  you can't encourage people to break the law especially with such a gigantic platform as time
[03:26:37.880 --> 03:26:44.280]  magazine again it's solicitation this is one of the definitions criminal solicitation is
[03:26:44.280 --> 03:26:50.280]  requesting encouraging or demanding someone to engage in criminal conduct they're encouraging
[03:26:50.280 --> 03:26:56.760]  65 million americans to engage in criminal conduct because their butt hurt that hillary didn't win
[03:26:57.320 --> 03:27:03.240]  can you imagine if fox news came out after the election if donald trump had lost and encouraged
[03:27:03.800 --> 03:27:11.160]  60 odd million donald trump supporters to not pay their taxes to commit criminal acts if they were
[03:27:11.160 --> 03:27:17.880]  out rioting on the street would fox news legitimize all that as fair protests as cnn did well no and if
[03:27:17.880 --> 03:27:23.560]  they did the left would be up in arms about it but they can encourage people to commit criminal
[03:27:23.560 --> 03:27:29.320]  behavior and it's just it's moral it's just a moral stand against donald trump because he's
[03:27:29.320 --> 03:27:35.720]  literally hitler again all based off of this complete hysteria which has been pushed for the
[03:27:35.720 --> 03:27:41.480]  last 18 months by the media that donald trump i mean i still get messages from people who are
[03:27:41.480 --> 03:27:49.560]  disabled who think donald trump is going to put disabled people in gulags because he once
[03:27:49.560 --> 03:27:54.840]  did an impersonation of someone which as and kulter has vehemently proven over and over again
[03:27:54.840 --> 03:28:01.000]  wasn't even based on the guy's disability in fact she put the video clips together the infamous
[03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:06.600]  impression that trump did of this so-called disabled guy he'd done the exact same impression
[03:28:07.320 --> 03:28:12.680]  for innumerable other people it was a flailing idiot impression it wasn't an
[03:28:12.680 --> 03:28:20.520]  impression of a particular disabled person but based off that one hoax that one fake news narrative
[03:28:20.520 --> 03:28:26.120]  that donald trump made fun of a disabled person that has literally got thousands of disabled people
[03:28:26.120 --> 03:28:32.760]  absolutely hysterical believing that they're going to be persecuted by a trump administration
[03:28:32.760 --> 03:28:38.760]  again another example of a fake news narrative by the mainstream media causing hysteria you have
[03:28:38.760 --> 03:28:45.240]  cnn today this is up on info war cnn run segments suggesting trump will put muslims in internment
[03:28:45.240 --> 03:28:53.640]  camps again what did you see with ohio state the islamic terrorist motivated by mistreatment
[03:28:53.640 --> 03:29:01.640]  of muslims in his own words by complaints over islamophobia now what is cnn doing by giving
[03:29:01.640 --> 03:29:07.640]  someone a platform to make the hysterical assertion that trump is going to put muslims
[03:29:07.640 --> 03:29:13.640]  in concentration camps well he's radicalizing would be jihadists that's what the mainstream
[03:29:13.640 --> 03:29:19.480]  media is doing with this fake news narrative again that trump is going to put muslims in
[03:29:19.480 --> 03:29:25.640]  concentration camps time magazine telling americans to break the law you have violent
[03:29:25.640 --> 03:29:32.040]  death threats against electors again being promulgated by the fake news narrative that hillary
[03:29:32.040 --> 03:29:38.760]  clinton should have won the election because she won the popular vote that is inciting violence
[03:29:38.760 --> 03:29:45.160]  numerous direct examples of the mainstream media's fake news narrative inciting violence we'll be
[03:29:45.160 --> 03:29:52.280]  back on the alex jones you're after the break don't go away we're on the march the empires on the run
[03:29:52.280 --> 03:30:16.920]  alex jones and the gcn radio network the web giants at youtube facebook twitter and microsoft have announced that they are stepping up efforts to remove extremist content from the internet as the EU demands social media websites censor fake news within 24 hours
[03:30:16.920 --> 03:30:46.200]  meanwhile the fake news controversy is being exploited by the mainstream media to characterize completely legitimate alternative news sources for example cbs news just listed info wars as a fake news website and that's because the mainstream establishment media is losing all credibility with the american people and it was alternative and social media who helped donald trump win the presidential election so now the globalist battle plan is to

[03:36:14.440 --> 03:36:21.640]  of germany on well guess what cultural enrichment muslim migrants raping and murdering people
[03:36:21.640 --> 03:36:28.440]  as angela merkel tries to ban the burqa like that is the main concern of germans right now
[03:36:28.440 --> 03:36:33.240]  oh we've got people being raped and murdered and we've got the government hunting us down for our
[03:36:33.240 --> 03:36:38.760]  inflammatory facebook posts oh but angela merkel is going to ban the burqa nobody cares about that
[03:36:38.760 --> 03:36:43.000]  anymore it's gone way beyond that we're going to get into that but first i want to go to this brexit
[03:36:43.000 --> 03:36:49.160]  video we've got a supreme court ruling in the united kingdom they're trying to derail brexit
[03:36:49.160 --> 03:36:54.520]  they're trying to sabotage brexit as a populist wave sweeps europe as he saw with italy on the
[03:36:54.520 --> 03:37:02.520]  weekend the political class is trying to sabotage it here's brexit the betrayal exactly as i predicted
[03:37:02.520 --> 03:37:07.880]  five months ago the political class the establishment and the media are doing everything imaginable
[03:37:07.880 --> 03:37:14.200]  to sabotage brexit so they had a by-election in richmond an area in london that voted 70 percent
[03:37:14.200 --> 03:37:21.400]  to remain in the eu and imagine my shock the pro-remain candidate won first off when are we having
[03:37:21.400 --> 03:37:26.920]  a second by-election i mean that's how you want it right just keep making everyone vote again and
[03:37:26.920 --> 03:37:31.560]  again until you get the result you want but then the media came out and hailed it as a stunning
[03:37:31.560 --> 03:37:38.680]  reversal of brexit sentiment across the entire country right so 20 000 posh in richmond represents
[03:37:38.680 --> 03:37:46.200]  the country better than 17.4 million brexit voters i don't think so so you got 70 of the vote for
[03:37:46.200 --> 03:37:52.920]  remain but only 50 of the vote for the remain candidate sarah olney let me do the maths here
[03:37:52.920 --> 03:37:58.760]  you lost 20 of the vote in an area that was already overwhelmingly pro-remain how on earth
[03:37:58.760 --> 03:38:04.440]  is that a repudiation of brexit olney said that brexit supporters were intolerant backward looking
[03:38:04.440 --> 03:38:10.440]  and divisive a regurgitation of the narrative that anyone who voted for leave is a racist bigger who
[03:38:10.440 --> 03:38:15.800]  just hates immigrants isn't it interesting that olney and her supporters like to virtue signal
[03:38:15.800 --> 03:38:22.200]  about how tolerant and pro-diversity they are while choosing to live in the whitest area of
[03:38:22.200 --> 03:38:27.320]  london possible yeah if you're so convinced about the wonderful cultural enrichment that mass
[03:38:27.320 --> 03:38:33.720]  immigration brings why do you reside in the area with the least number of immigrants pretty racist
[03:38:33.720 --> 03:38:39.080]  if you ask me and while we're on the subject of intolerance its vote remain supporters who have
[03:38:39.080 --> 03:38:45.320]  been the most intolerant of brexit voters disowning them smearing them publicly shaming them
[03:38:45.320 --> 03:38:51.480]  attacking them in the street wishing deadly illnesses upon their babies olney also said
[03:38:51.480 --> 03:38:58.120]  that she would quote vote to override the referendum result so let me get this straight your party
[03:38:58.120 --> 03:39:06.360]  has the word democrats in its name yet you're talking about overriding the democratic will
[03:39:06.360 --> 03:39:11.240]  of the british people yeah that's not very democratic olney had to be dragged off the air
[03:39:11.240 --> 03:39:17.560]  by her spin doctor during a radio show because she made a complete tit out of herself proving she
[03:39:17.560 --> 03:39:22.680]  knew nothing about the eu there was no clear manifesto for what happened to you know our
[03:39:22.680 --> 03:39:26.520]  membership of the single market or what there was the remain campaign said we were going to leave
[03:39:26.520 --> 03:39:33.560]  the single market if we voted out i did they repeated it every single member leading member
[03:39:33.560 --> 03:39:37.800]  of the remain campaign said a vote to leave the eu was a vote to leave the single market nothing
[03:39:37.800 --> 03:39:45.800]  unclear about that at all i am i'm really sorry but sir only have to leave now no she doesn't
[03:39:45.800 --> 03:39:49.160]  sarah if you're not if you want to be elected member of parliament i think you should probably
[03:39:49.160 --> 03:39:52.920]  be able to answer some simple questions about your policy can you get sarah back on the line please
[03:39:53.480 --> 03:39:57.240]  sorry about that we've waited an hour we've i don't know who you are we've waited in an
[03:39:57.240 --> 03:40:01.720]  hour to have this interview if you don't want to answer questions from a radio station perhaps
[03:40:01.720 --> 03:40:07.560]  she's not fit to be an mp and they had the temerity to call vote leave supporters low
[03:40:07.560 --> 03:40:13.000]  information this all happened after a ruling by a bunch of corrupt euro file high court judges
[03:40:13.000 --> 03:40:18.440]  who said that when we all voted for the government to implement brexit it didn't really mean that
[03:40:18.440 --> 03:40:22.760]  we were voting for the government to implement brexit that's strange because when i received this
[03:40:22.760 --> 03:40:29.000]  letter from the government before brexit it said the government will implement what you decide it
[03:40:29.000 --> 03:40:34.440]  didn't say your vote is worthless because we'll just keep having referendums until we get the
[03:40:34.440 --> 03:40:40.200]  result we want it didn't say your vote is worthless because a bunch of f***ish celebrities corrupt
[03:40:40.200 --> 03:40:45.400]  judges and lefty politicians will whine and f*** for months to try and subvert and sabotage a
[03:40:45.400 --> 03:40:51.160]  democratic result because they lost and they're butt hurt about it it didn't say your vote is
[03:40:51.160 --> 03:40:56.760]  worthless because your own supposed representatives will demand a parliamentary vote and then vote
[03:40:56.760 --> 03:41:02.200]  against the democratic decision of their own constituents it didn't say your vote is worthless
[03:41:02.200 --> 03:41:07.720]  because we'll insert endless amendments to water it down to the point where it's unrecognizable
[03:41:07.720 --> 03:41:11.800]  from what you thought you were voting on in the first place and now we're about to have another
[03:41:11.800 --> 03:41:18.040]  bunch of corrupt euro file judges tell us once again that our vote meant nothing while the media
[03:41:18.040 --> 03:41:24.280]  lectures us to not be mean to the corrupt euro file judges while remain pressure groups celebrate
[03:41:24.280 --> 03:41:31.000]  the high court ruling as a victory for parliamentary sovereignty as they support the very entity the
[03:41:31.000 --> 03:41:37.640]  EU that has completely eviscerated parliamentary sovereignty while remain pressure groups literally
[03:41:37.640 --> 03:41:44.840]  call themselves their people's challenge while all over the will of the people while super
[03:41:44.840 --> 03:41:51.640]  wealthy elitists like Gina Miller swoop in to save the country from the baying brexit mob what part
[03:41:51.640 --> 03:41:57.240]  of the word leave don't you understand the baying brexit mob being poor people across the country
[03:41:57.240 --> 03:42:02.760]  who have lost their jobs and seen their communities crippled because of the EU while the media
[03:42:02.760 --> 03:42:09.080]  constantly invokes an mp that was murdered by a neo-nazi lunatic to suggest somehow that brexit
[03:42:09.080 --> 03:42:15.080]  supporters were responsible her stance on refugees and immigration attracted the attention of those
[03:42:15.080 --> 03:42:21.800]  with sinister extreme views while the media blames brexit supporters for a hate crime wave that never
[03:42:21.800 --> 03:42:28.360]  happened hate crime prosecutions actually fell while the bbc and sky news compete with each other
[03:42:28.360 --> 03:42:37.080]  to see who can suck the most globalist while tony blare the war criminal rises from whatever
[03:42:37.080 --> 03:42:43.960]  godforsaken crypt he's been hiding in to scorn the silly plebs for daring to defy the globalists
[03:42:43.960 --> 03:42:49.960]  who know what's best for them while thousands of libtards the same ones who protested against
[03:42:49.960 --> 03:42:55.800]  Blair's bloodletting crowd the streets to virtue signal about how we need to remain in the EU
[03:42:55.800 --> 03:43:06.120]  because love or something yeah word of advice attaching your political cause to an arbitrary
[03:43:06.120 --> 03:43:13.400]  emotion that has nothing to do with reality isn't an argument while those same libtards side with
[03:43:13.400 --> 03:43:19.640]  the very multi-millionaires wall street banks and crony capitalist financial institutions
[03:43:19.640 --> 03:43:25.160]  that they supposedly despise if the people in this country think that they're going to be cheated
[03:43:25.160 --> 03:43:29.320]  they're going to be betrayed then we will see political anger the likes of which none of us in
[03:43:29.320 --> 03:43:34.840]  our lifetimes have ever witnessed in this country this is exactly what i warned would happen after
[03:43:34.840 --> 03:43:41.640]  brexit this is what they've done in every european country that's rejected the EU dictatorship just
[03:43:41.640 --> 03:43:47.720]  keep making them vote again and again and again just keep pounding them over the head with rulings
[03:43:47.720 --> 03:43:53.480]  judgments and delays just keep pounding them with hysteria about the dreadful apocalypse that will
[03:43:53.480 --> 03:43:59.400]  befall any country that dares to reclaim its national sovereignty just keep brow beating them
[03:43:59.400 --> 03:44:06.200]  into submission well we're not going to submit as Nigel Farage said if this Tory government doesn't
[03:44:06.200 --> 03:44:12.440]  deliver brexit the political class is in for a seismic shock things are going to be different
[03:44:12.440 --> 03:44:19.240]  this time we're done potting up with your crap there's a populist revolution sweeping the west
[03:44:19.240 --> 03:44:27.080]  in america italy france germany holland and we're not going to let you stand in the way of it
[03:44:30.280 --> 03:44:37.000]  that is brexit betrayal it's up on my youtube channel get that share it we're going to stay in
[03:44:37.000 --> 03:44:44.280]  in the european union right now we've got yahoo news reporting setting sights on fourth term yeah
[03:44:44.280 --> 03:44:50.520]  fourth term merkel vows tough line on migration what she actually vowed was pretty much nothing
[03:44:50.520 --> 03:44:57.960]  whatsoever she vowed to ban the burqa in certain public places under certain certain circumstances
[03:44:57.960 --> 03:45:04.440]  well gee thanks great germans don't even care about that anymore it's gone way beyond that
[03:45:04.440 --> 03:45:11.480]  we have yet another case of a muslim migrant raping and killing a woman we have official
[03:45:11.480 --> 03:45:18.120]  german government statistics over the past year proving that migrant violent crimes rapes murders
[03:45:18.120 --> 03:45:26.360]  have skyrocketed we've got a media in germany that is covering it up this new case again a 19
[03:45:26.360 --> 03:45:34.680]  year old medical student who by coincidence was a refugee activist and her own parents at her funeral
[03:45:34.680 --> 03:45:40.760]  collected money for charities that want to bring more migrants into germany
[03:45:43.960 --> 03:45:48.440]  absolutely ridiculous but again she was cycling home from a party late at night
[03:45:48.440 --> 03:45:56.040]  this migrant ambushes her rapes her dumps her body in the river it causes absolute
[03:45:56.040 --> 03:46:02.360]  fury across germany as the cologne mass molestation did back on new year's eve and again
[03:46:02.360 --> 03:46:09.400]  exactly the same situation the media failed to report on it information liberation reports
[03:46:09.400 --> 03:46:15.880]  german state media refused to run migrant murder story say it's too regional so this was a major
[03:46:15.880 --> 03:46:20.440]  news program they said they couldn't report on the story because it was too regional wasn't that
[03:46:20.440 --> 03:46:28.200]  important even though the entire world was talking about it okay that's bs we have facebook now
[03:46:28.200 --> 03:46:35.400]  this was an individual who contacted me facebook banning a german citizen because she posted a
[03:46:35.400 --> 03:46:42.200]  picture of the migrant rapist on facebook and said this is the person who did it with a link to his
[03:46:42.200 --> 03:46:49.640]  profile which is publicly available on facebook okay the picture of the migrant rapist who is
[03:46:49.640 --> 03:46:55.720]  being called hossain k his actual name is on his facebook profile anyone can find it they haven't
[03:46:55.720 --> 03:47:02.040]  removed it they probably have now after i put this article out so all she did was said this is his
[03:47:02.040 --> 03:47:07.560]  profile this is the guy who did it after his picture which is on the facebook profile was
[03:47:07.560 --> 03:47:15.640]  already circulating in mainstream media yet facebook banned her and shut her account down
[03:47:15.640 --> 03:47:20.840]  so again it goes back to what we reported a year ago facebook is working directly with the german
[03:47:20.840 --> 03:47:28.200]  government and with x members of the stasi to hunt down germans who make inflammatory facebook
[03:47:28.200 --> 03:47:33.880]  posts about the migrant crisis and again the question was well how do you characterize hate
[03:47:33.880 --> 03:47:42.120]  speech what constitutes hate speech well posting an image of a murderer which is already public
[03:47:42.120 --> 03:47:49.240]  in the mainstream media on facebook that now constitutes hate speech according to facebook
[03:47:49.240 --> 03:47:56.840]  that's what she was told she was banned so again people say you know facebook's a private company
[03:47:56.840 --> 03:48:01.080]  they can remove what they like i mean why would you complain about a private company having the
[03:48:01.080 --> 03:48:07.560]  right to host whatever content it likes well social media is no longer private it's now the
[03:48:07.560 --> 03:48:14.200]  de facto public common commons and you've got the german government again working with facebook
[03:48:14.200 --> 03:48:22.040]  to legally go after people harass them in their own homes for posting quote xenophobic content
[03:48:22.840 --> 03:48:27.880]  again a people posting let's go and burn the migrants enter down let's go and kill migrants
[03:48:27.880 --> 03:48:33.160]  are they posting that well yeah in some cases and that is hate speech and it should be prosecuted
[03:48:33.720 --> 03:48:38.680]  but look what happened here she posted an image that was already in the mainstream media
[03:48:38.680 --> 03:48:45.160]  she's guilty of hate speech will she get a knock on the door from the german thought police
[03:48:46.040 --> 03:48:50.840]  we've seen it in the netherlands again home visits from police for somebody who said their
[03:48:50.840 --> 03:48:59.640]  government's migrant policy was wrong monday milk toast criticism of migrant policies is receiving
[03:48:59.640 --> 03:49:04.920]  home visits they're getting home visits from the police to their private homes because of what
[03:49:04.920 --> 03:49:12.200]  they say on facebook and it is nowhere near hate speech but again we've seen from the eu commission
[03:49:12.200 --> 03:49:18.200]  the unelected bureaucratic body they're now saying that fake news can be treated in the same context
[03:49:18.200 --> 03:49:26.200]  as jihadist propaganda demanding it be censored within 24 hours again this is the same body that
[03:49:26.200 --> 03:49:32.040]  has put out recommendations saying you shouldn't be able to criticize members of the eu commission
[03:49:32.040 --> 03:49:38.920]  that's fake news now we have a fake news list created by an extremely left-wing
[03:49:38.920 --> 03:49:44.600]  bias social justice warrior being used by the mainstream media we have a second fake news
[03:49:44.600 --> 03:49:50.840]  list that was put out which included even left-wing websites that were critical of hillary clinton
[03:49:51.640 --> 03:49:59.000]  one of which naked capitalism is now suing the washington post for defamation again glenn
[03:49:59.000 --> 03:50:06.600]  greenwald debunked this vehemently this shadowy group using macarthia blacklist propaganda again
[03:50:07.560 --> 03:50:12.920]  to characterize any information that goes against the establishment interests as fake news
[03:50:12.920 --> 03:50:19.080]  this is so transparent what they're doing and now they're trying to tie it with hate speech
[03:50:19.080 --> 03:50:24.760]  they're using this pizza gate incident to say that fake news is inciting violence when they're the
[03:50:24.760 --> 03:50:31.000]  ones inciting violence with all this hysteria about what donald trump's gonna do oh donald trump's
[03:50:31.000 --> 03:50:38.200]  gonna put muslims in camps again that is gonna radicalize actual jihadists like it did at ohio
[03:50:38.200 --> 03:50:44.040]  state they're the ones pushing hysterical propaganda they're the ones inciting violence
[03:50:44.040 --> 03:50:51.800]  they're the ones time magazine urging people to break the law to not pay their taxes urging people

[03:55:03.640 --> 03:55:13.480]  trump so the recount in michigan which is started in wane county and detroit they found that many
[03:55:13.480 --> 03:55:20.840]  voting machines broke on election day in wane county and detroit and this was buried in a guardian
[03:55:20.840 --> 03:55:29.560]  article the one of the election officials there said that a jammed ballot was removed and reinserted
[03:55:29.560 --> 03:55:33.800]  he's talking about the broken voting machines every time a jammed ballot was removed and
[03:55:33.800 --> 03:55:39.400]  reinserted he suspects the machine may have recounted it again this is in wane county and
[03:55:39.400 --> 03:55:45.880]  detroit heavily pro democratic pro hillary clinton areas so those hillary voters in detroit in wane
[03:55:45.880 --> 03:55:52.680]  county according to this official were voting twice for hillary clinton so if anything trump's
[03:55:52.680 --> 03:55:59.320]  margin of victory in michigan is going to be even larger and the only actual vote fraud or vote
[03:55:59.320 --> 03:56:07.720]  irregularity was in favor of hillary clinton switching again back to germany let's hit a
[03:56:07.720 --> 03:56:12.440]  few final news stories here suspects arrested for sex attacks on chinese students in west germany
[03:56:12.440 --> 03:56:19.320]  well imagine my shock it's another migrant in a sex attack iraqi asylum seeker who came to germany
[03:56:19.320 --> 03:56:25.320]  last year he attacked a student from china then he had attacked another student from china who
[03:56:25.320 --> 03:56:30.840]  was reported that she was attacked and raped he tried to abrite the other one ended up only
[03:56:30.840 --> 03:56:37.960]  seriously injuring her again that is on top of the other story another afghan migrant arrested on
[03:56:37.960 --> 03:56:43.880]  friday for the rape and murder of a woman germany's really enjoying its cultural enrichment right now
[03:56:44.440 --> 03:56:49.640]  this is out of sport nick coincidence german stats show surging sex crime rate around refugee
[03:56:49.640 --> 03:56:55.800]  centers oh well imagine my shock once again so again they mapped the robberies the attempted
[03:56:55.800 --> 03:57:02.600]  rapes the violent crimes in these german cities and found low and behold they were all concentrated
[03:57:02.600 --> 03:57:10.040]  around refugee camps what a surprise there's a story out of sweden which is even further along
[03:57:10.040 --> 03:57:15.400]  the germany five teens charged with raping boy in sweden swedish authorities have charged five

[03:57:26.040 --> 03:57:33.000]  went to the police so again not just germans that being targeted here many of the victims are young
[03:57:33.800 --> 03:57:39.800]  migrant children in and around these migrant camps so again will the left care about that
[03:57:39.800 --> 03:57:44.520]  if it's brown kids being raped they don't seem to care if it's white kids being raped again
[03:57:44.520 --> 03:57:51.080]  again you have ads in germany saying everyone's going to wear the burka cultural harmony diversity
