[00:00.000 --> 00:07.360]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:07.360 --> 00:16.080]  My fellow Americans, tonight I am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian
[00:16.080 --> 00:19.960]  and security crisis at our southern border.
[00:19.960 --> 00:25.160]  Every day, Customs and Border Patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants
[00:25.160 --> 00:27.720]  trying to enter our country.
[00:27.720 --> 00:33.600]  We are out of space to hold them, and we have no way to promptly return them back home to
[00:33.600 --> 00:35.320]  their country.
[00:35.320 --> 00:40.720]  America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute
[00:40.720 --> 00:42.320]  to our nation.
[00:42.320 --> 00:48.720]  But all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration.
[00:48.720 --> 00:53.360]  It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages.
[00:53.360 --> 00:58.760]  Among those hardest hit are African Americans and Hispanic Americans.
[00:58.760 --> 01:04.680]  Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth,
[01:04.680 --> 01:08.120]  heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.
[01:08.120 --> 01:14.880]  Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90 percent of which floods
[01:14.880 --> 01:18.120]  across from our southern border.
[01:18.120 --> 01:25.320]  Our Americans will die from drugs this year, then were killed in the entire Vietnam War.
[01:25.320 --> 01:34.280]  In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including
[01:34.280 --> 01:46.600]  those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings.
[01:46.600 --> 01:51.760]  Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally
[01:51.760 --> 01:59.680]  entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don't act right now.
[01:59.680 --> 02:07.640]  This is a humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul.
[02:07.640 --> 02:14.400]  Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States, a dramatic
[02:14.400 --> 02:15.400]  increase.
[02:15.400 --> 02:22.280]  These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.
[02:22.280 --> 02:28.540]  One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico.
[02:28.540 --> 02:34.760]  Women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system.
[02:34.760 --> 02:40.620]  This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border.
[02:40.620 --> 02:47.000]  This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end.
[02:47.000 --> 02:53.520]  My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border
[02:53.520 --> 02:59.080]  and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers, and human traffickers.
[02:59.080 --> 03:01.440]  It's a tremendous problem.
[03:01.440 --> 03:07.320]  Our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the Department
[03:07.320 --> 03:09.600]  of Homeland Security.
[03:09.600 --> 03:15.040]  These are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission and keep
[03:15.040 --> 03:20.880]  America safe, in fact, safer than ever before.
[03:20.880 --> 03:27.520]  The proposal from Homeland Security includes cutting-edge technology for detecting drugs,
[03:27.520 --> 03:31.800]  weapons, illegal contraband, and many other things.
[03:31.800 --> 03:39.320]  We have requested more agents, immigration judges, and bed space to process the sharp
[03:39.320 --> 03:44.320]  rise in unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy.
[03:44.320 --> 03:51.800]  Our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support.
[03:51.800 --> 03:58.480]  Furthermore, we have asked Congress to close border security loopholes so that illegal
[03:58.480 --> 04:04.720]  immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home.
[04:04.720 --> 04:10.480]  Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals
[04:10.480 --> 04:15.240]  have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier.
[04:15.240 --> 04:22.120]  All right, folks, that is the first few minutes of the president's nine-and-a-half-minute
[04:22.120 --> 04:26.200]  address last night, where he reversed course from what he had been saying, what the vice
[04:26.200 --> 04:31.360]  president had been saying, what we've been lobbying for, and what has been the big buzz
[04:31.360 --> 04:33.680]  the last few weeks.
[04:33.680 --> 04:35.800]  And that is declaring a national emergency.
[04:35.800 --> 04:41.040]  This country is an emergency, and he has to do it to counterman the previous executive
[04:41.040 --> 04:42.040]  orders in place.
[04:42.040 --> 04:46.040]  That's what presidents normally sign a bunch of executive orders right when they come in
[04:46.040 --> 04:47.640]  to override the past ones.
[04:47.640 --> 04:52.080]  And Trump did that to a certain extent, but not the ones repealing basically the martial
[04:52.080 --> 04:53.520]  law Obama put us under.
[04:53.520 --> 05:00.280]  We'll break it all down straight ahead, but this is some dire, dire straits.
[05:00.280 --> 05:04.320]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[05:04.320 --> 05:09.520]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[05:09.520 --> 05:12.440]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[05:12.440 --> 05:16.600]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've
[05:16.600 --> 05:19.360]  gone through two permutations.
[05:19.360 --> 05:23.560]  This seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists
[05:23.560 --> 05:25.480]  tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[05:25.480 --> 05:30.320]  So we discovered deep earth crystals, a pure nascent iodine, and brought you X2.
[05:30.320 --> 05:31.320]  That's been incredible.
[05:31.320 --> 05:36.680]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[05:36.680 --> 05:41.400]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine, but chemists, scientists, and others showed
[05:41.400 --> 05:46.400]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine
[05:46.400 --> 05:52.920]  and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[05:52.920 --> 05:56.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[05:56.080 --> 05:57.080]  discovery.
[05:57.080 --> 06:27.000]  This is X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[06:27.080 --> 06:35.200]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center, it's Alex Jones.
[06:35.200 --> 06:39.320]  You know, if you watch what's happening not just here, but in South America, in Eastern
[06:39.320 --> 06:45.920]  Europe, in Western Europe, in areas of Asia, in the UK, all over the place, populist movements
[06:45.920 --> 06:47.880]  are exploding.
[06:47.880 --> 06:51.640]  Nations from Brazil to Australia are pulling out of the fake carbon taxes.
[06:51.640 --> 06:57.880]  It was Paris, where they got the world government law in place, and now Macron's had to back
[06:57.880 --> 06:58.880]  out of that.
[06:58.880 --> 07:06.560]  So there are very positive good things happening against the UN globalist-led attempt to collapse
[07:06.560 --> 07:09.520]  nation-states and bring in a one-world government.
[07:09.520 --> 07:17.200]  There's a big awakening, but it's like a football game that's gone into overtime, and one minute
[07:17.200 --> 07:21.880]  we're about to win, the next minute they're winning, it's that close.
[07:21.880 --> 07:29.000]  So I've been very exuberant, the last few days, that Trump's fired a bunch of globalists
[07:29.000 --> 07:33.720]  and a bunch of chai-com operatives, and he has been signaling that he's going to get
[07:33.720 --> 07:36.240]  very aggressive with the deep state.
[07:36.240 --> 07:41.680]  But he announced six months ago he was going to declassify all the illegal spying on him,
[07:41.680 --> 07:47.600]  and then he ordered it, and suddenly, well, intelligence agencies are refusing to do it.
[07:47.600 --> 07:51.640]  And then you say, well, it's like telling your kids to clean their room, and they won't
[07:51.640 --> 07:52.640]  do it.
[07:52.640 --> 08:00.360]  He's got 16, 17 agencies, 800,000 contractors, over a million intelligence operatives, and
[08:00.360 --> 08:05.320]  they're just doing whatever they want.
[08:05.320 --> 08:09.880]  And so you saw them reverse and not follow his order there.
[08:09.880 --> 08:15.560]  You saw Trump say, pull our 2,000 troops out that are giving weapons to the Kurds, stop
[08:15.560 --> 08:16.560]  destabilizing the area.
[08:16.560 --> 08:20.800]  We still have troops right there in Iraq, we have missile cruisers in the Mediterranean,
[08:20.800 --> 08:26.200]  we're still there, but not with our troops on the ground in sand and blood.
[08:26.200 --> 08:32.800]  And within days, the bureaucracy says we're not going to do it.
[08:32.800 --> 08:38.760]  We're going to do whatever we want, whenever we want.
[08:38.760 --> 08:43.640]  So that's how these people operate.
[08:43.640 --> 08:48.080]  And so I'm not just talking up here.
[08:48.080 --> 08:52.920]  Trump signals through Pence and himself that we're in an emergency, the country is an emergency
[08:52.920 --> 08:57.200]  already, and I may declare one if they don't take action.
[08:57.200 --> 09:01.800]  Then they start threatening to plunge the stock market if he does that and know it's
[09:01.800 --> 09:06.640]  going to make it worse, and he knows full well they're trying that.
[09:06.640 --> 09:11.000]  And then they start saying they're going to refuse to follow the order, so he blinked.
[09:11.000 --> 09:13.400]  He backed down from it.
[09:13.400 --> 09:17.480]  And that is not a good sign.
[09:17.480 --> 09:21.480]  And there's a lot of other examples of this as well, where the President gives an order
[09:21.480 --> 09:23.040]  and it's not followed.
[09:23.040 --> 09:27.520]  We've seen Mattis and Kelly brag about how, oh, we never both leave the city at the same
[09:27.520 --> 09:31.640]  time or leave the President's side because he might order a nuclear war or something.
[09:31.640 --> 09:35.280]  When he's trying to have peace with North Korea and peace with Russia and all the rest
[09:35.280 --> 09:40.800]  of it, and they're the ones pushing for war, and how routinely he signs an executive order
[09:40.800 --> 09:44.800]  and they just don't execute it and put it in the Federal Register and hope he forgets
[09:44.800 --> 09:48.600]  about it because he's just trying to move through and make decisions.
[09:48.600 --> 09:52.880]  He called Trump an idiot and retarded.
[09:52.880 --> 09:58.520]  See, these guys all come from a system where they kiss each other's butts, where they act
[09:58.520 --> 10:03.600]  powerful, and where they act like they're in charge, you know what they're doing, but really
[10:03.600 --> 10:09.200]  they're all the bureaucracy and we're put there because they're yeshmen.
[10:09.200 --> 10:15.520]  Trump is a entrepreneur and an individual who does care about the country and doesn't
[10:15.520 --> 10:19.640]  want to see it screwed over and thinks the President should be the President.
[10:19.640 --> 10:21.680]  And the swamp distains that.
[10:21.680 --> 10:23.000]  They believe they've captured America.
[10:23.000 --> 10:24.000]  They believe they run America.
[10:24.000 --> 10:30.840]  But I'm going to make the announcement right here, right now.
[10:30.840 --> 10:37.480]  President Trump was on the knife's edge of truly becoming the President and being on the
[10:37.480 --> 10:44.280]  George Washington Cut, the George Washington Mold of a true absolute Maverick trailblazer.
[10:44.280 --> 10:55.080]  He's one of the knife edge of being that or being a captured, gelded stallion, neutered,
[10:55.080 --> 11:00.400]  who is contained by a bunch of Washington manipulators that telling whatever he wants
[11:00.400 --> 11:04.040]  to hear to his face and then talk absolute trash about him behind his back.
[11:04.040 --> 11:08.040]  So he's been on the knife's edge of becoming the President and the real Maverick.
[11:08.040 --> 11:14.400]  They fear he could become, he's already a Maverick.
[11:14.400 --> 11:19.420]  Or he could fall off the knife's edge and become a puppet President completely cut
[11:19.420 --> 11:23.680]  off like a Chinese Emperor, where they think they're making decisions and giving orders,
[11:23.680 --> 11:25.960]  but they're not.
[11:25.960 --> 11:32.000]  And with what he did last night, it turns the ship towards the course more of the President
[11:32.000 --> 11:33.000]  not being the President.
[11:33.000 --> 11:41.560]  And that's the headline for the live feed on InfoWars.com today, is President Trump
[11:41.560 --> 11:48.880]  is becoming the President in name only.
[11:48.880 --> 11:53.240]  And he's being maneuvered towards impeachment and removal from office.
[11:53.240 --> 11:57.560]  And the deep state isn't going to allow the populism and the freedom that put him in office,
[11:57.560 --> 12:01.720]  that's the real message, is globally, liberty's rising.
[12:01.720 --> 12:08.960]  They're going to come after everyone, the Christian Coalition, Franklin Graham, Mainline
[12:08.960 --> 12:17.000]  NRA, understand that folks, they set the precedent with me, they're coming for everyone and
[12:17.000 --> 12:20.600]  they're coming for everyone now.
[12:20.600 --> 12:25.920]  In Europe, Germany has basically declared martial law over any nationalist.
[12:25.920 --> 12:31.200]  People are stopped at train stations and asked if they're white by the police if they are
[12:31.200 --> 12:39.320]  racist right-wingers, they're just preparing people if they have blonde hair.
[12:39.320 --> 12:42.640]  That's up on InfoWars.com with the video.
[12:42.640 --> 12:45.480]  And then the police got asked about it and they said, oh, it's just a social experiment.
[12:45.480 --> 12:46.480]  Exactly.
[12:46.480 --> 12:49.720]  They're conditioning people.
[12:49.720 --> 12:51.760]  They should not say no to the invasion.
[12:51.760 --> 12:58.240]  Migrant boats have now showed up and landed in England funded by Soros.
[12:58.240 --> 12:59.680]  So they're collapsing the third world.
[12:59.680 --> 13:05.400]  This is a global war against national sovereignty, a global war against humanity.
[13:05.400 --> 13:08.480]  And they're coming in with total internet censorship, total internet control.
[13:08.480 --> 13:13.600]  I'm going to break the architecture down on that today.
[13:13.600 --> 13:16.760]  And they're going to try to show the planet up.
[13:16.760 --> 13:23.120]  They're going to bring in the authoritarianism hard core if the nationalist in Brazil and
[13:23.120 --> 13:31.280]  the United States and the UK and France and everywhere else are unable to stop it.
[13:31.280 --> 13:33.840]  Now the globalists are very close to losing.
[13:33.840 --> 13:36.440]  That's why they're fighting so hard.
[13:36.440 --> 13:42.600]  But if we act, we ask to brazen authoritarianism, they could win.
[13:42.600 --> 13:44.880]  And see, they have nothing to lose.
[13:44.880 --> 13:47.000]  They know what they've done, they know their plan.
[13:47.000 --> 13:57.200]  It's official 2001 UN plan to flood the United States and Canada with 600 million migrants
[13:57.200 --> 14:01.040]  that they bring in, who they brainwash and who they weaponize politically.
[14:01.040 --> 14:02.040]  That's official.
[14:02.040 --> 14:04.720]  That's from the official UN documents.
[14:04.720 --> 14:09.160]  They want 300 million in the UN plan by 2035.
[14:09.160 --> 14:16.160]  And of course you've heard Macron say by 2025, 200 million North Africans in Europe.
[14:16.160 --> 14:25.160]  15 million military aged men Muslims that just hit have turned Europe into a giant
[14:25.160 --> 14:28.160]  outdoor sewer of rape, robbery and death.
[14:28.160 --> 14:30.240]  So many articles and stories that can't even keep track of it.
[14:30.240 --> 14:31.600]  You're like, this is insane.
[14:31.600 --> 14:32.960]  Why kill the tourism?
[14:32.960 --> 14:37.040]  Why have carjackings and highways blocked and thousands of cars burned a night across
[14:37.040 --> 14:38.040]  Europe?
[14:38.040 --> 14:41.560]  Like thousands of cars.
[14:41.560 --> 14:46.420]  Because this is the left of the globalist breaking people.
[14:46.420 --> 14:49.160]  This is a siege.
[14:49.160 --> 14:54.480]  When the Vikings would invade your village, say in Jolly Old Cornwall, England, they'd
[14:54.480 --> 14:59.600]  rush in in the night, burning, screaming, killing, roaring, hoping you'd all just be
[14:59.600 --> 15:04.840]  naked, not being willing to pick up your sword and shield and run off into the woods.
[15:04.840 --> 15:09.000]  Then they could steal everything you had and then go pick you off in the woods, take
[15:09.000 --> 15:10.000]  the women they wanted to.
[15:10.000 --> 15:11.000]  It's the same thing.
[15:11.000 --> 15:17.320]  They're just turning giant migrant hordes, escorted by the police and the UN in to rape
[15:17.320 --> 15:27.160]  and repine in a till of the hun or Viking-esque scorched earth pillaging.
[15:27.160 --> 15:28.160]  It's the term.
[15:28.160 --> 15:29.160]  It's called pillaging.
[15:29.160 --> 15:31.160]  We're being pillaged.
[15:31.160 --> 15:36.440]  And now they're racking the U.S. up as if 35 million illegals isn't enough, and MS-13
[15:36.440 --> 15:39.480]  and all the mass crime waves out of Latin America.
[15:39.480 --> 15:42.280]  Trump says we have illegal aliens caught murdering people.
[15:42.280 --> 15:45.760]  They're criminals, some of them, and they go, oh, how dare you call convicted murderers
[15:45.760 --> 15:46.760]  criminals?
[15:46.760 --> 15:47.760]  So this is it.
[15:47.760 --> 15:52.840]  We're at war, and the guy we put in to try to stop it is being cut off from every angle
[15:52.840 --> 15:59.280]  of his rightful authority ahead of his removal, and then they're coming for everybody.
[15:59.280 --> 16:04.640]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[16:04.640 --> 16:05.640]  the world.
[16:05.640 --> 16:08.680]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[16:08.680 --> 16:14.640]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.

[20:12.480 --> 20:27.640]  Welcome back.
[20:27.640 --> 20:38.320]  This is the ProAmerica Common Sense, pro-family, pro-God, pro-prosperity broadcast and that's
[20:38.320 --> 20:42.880]  why we're absolutely hated by every scumbag organization on the planet because we've
[20:42.880 --> 20:51.400]  got the spirit to fight back and I'm never going to surrender and we've made spectacular
[20:51.400 --> 20:57.560]  eight-year gains against the globalists in the last five years that are hammer-blow.
[20:57.560 --> 21:03.320]  In fact, they believe in their own white papers that they're losing and cannot win and all
[21:03.320 --> 21:07.960]  the societal race war garbage they're putting out worldwide, playing different groups against
[21:07.960 --> 21:13.080]  each other is just a desperate rearguard action while they secure their stolen wealth
[21:13.080 --> 21:15.200]  and hope they don't go to prison.
[21:15.200 --> 21:22.800]  And you have to understand something, when I've already read something four or five
[21:22.800 --> 21:28.640]  times and researched it, it's so painful but I have to discipline myself and I need to
[21:28.640 --> 21:34.400]  come on air and do detailed reports and go over all the evidence but you have to understand
[21:34.400 --> 21:41.600]  they have the Tavistock Institute, DARPA and their brain studies divisions and others working
[21:41.600 --> 21:48.400]  around the clock to demoralize not just this country but everyone else and to make people
[21:48.400 --> 21:57.960]  as unhealthy and as depressed as possible and to destroy society.
[21:57.960 --> 21:59.600]  That's the goal.
[21:59.600 --> 22:03.280]  The American Psychological Association came out today and they run the schools in this
[22:03.280 --> 22:12.360]  country that they follow UNESCO rules and they announced classic masculinity that's a quote
[22:12.360 --> 22:15.640]  traits as a disorder.
[22:15.640 --> 22:24.480]  Now you heard that right, strong, upright, hardworking, steadfast, dauntless, determined,
[22:24.480 --> 22:32.240]  honorable, stoicism, competitiveness, dominance, aggression.
[22:32.240 --> 22:35.520]  All of this is toxic and they're putting it on news like it's normal.
[22:35.520 --> 22:41.880]  Now I told you they're out to get the men, the boys, we'll talk about it more later.
[22:41.880 --> 22:45.120]  They're out to get anybody that will stand up, they're getting rid of the military, everything's
[22:45.120 --> 22:47.160]  going to drones and robots.
[22:47.160 --> 22:54.560]  The old tradition of men is going and it's going to be replaced by automated killer robots.
[22:54.560 --> 22:57.600]  So I'm going to cover this more coming up.
[22:57.600 --> 23:00.120]  But this is it.
[23:00.120 --> 23:04.880]  Now of course this isn't meant to empower women, they're just teaching women, you're
[23:04.880 --> 23:09.080]  going to quote it to take care of yourself and the state's going to tell you what to
[23:09.080 --> 23:10.080]  do.
[23:10.080 --> 23:17.480]  It's going to be the dominant man now and the technocracy is.
[23:17.480 --> 23:22.800]  And so this is a high tech version of the slavery the Romans carried out and others
[23:22.800 --> 23:28.240]  against captured populations.
[23:28.240 --> 23:32.000]  And that's why we read the history of slavery, different histories of it and you look at this,
[23:32.000 --> 23:36.880]  it's very frightening, very, very, very, very frightening.
[23:36.880 --> 23:40.640]  And on the one hand they teach you and all the universities, I remember 20 years ago
[23:40.640 --> 23:47.680]  I was given a copy of a Calhoun reader because one of my friends, another talk show host
[23:47.680 --> 23:55.080]  here in Austin, his son was going to UT and he was going to get a criminal justice degree
[23:55.080 --> 24:00.600]  but it became a state trooper.
[24:00.600 --> 24:11.080]  And the official just base level social worker book, just you know they're segueing into
[24:11.080 --> 24:18.000]  that law enforcement, was that the family belongs to a prehistoric, primitive time and must
[24:18.000 --> 24:19.000]  be eradicated.
[24:19.000 --> 24:23.560]  And I remember when I got that and my heart was beating because I knew it was the plan
[24:23.560 --> 24:33.040]  and I'd seen it in UN documents but to stare at it and to see it and now 20 years later
[24:33.040 --> 24:40.760]  the American Psychological Association says men are bad period.
[24:40.760 --> 24:45.320]  And you pick up the newspaper and it's like my son likes to play army and fort but I'm
[24:45.320 --> 24:50.240]  going to teach him to wear a dress, this is actually in the news because it's the right
[24:50.240 --> 24:53.600]  thing to do.
[24:53.600 --> 24:58.760]  So when the left goes, oh let your son choose if they're a girl, these abusive leftists
[24:58.760 --> 25:01.600]  are doing this to their sons and they're not just putting them on a riddle and to mess
[25:01.600 --> 25:08.680]  them up but we're going to put you son on hormone blockers because this is the cult
[25:08.680 --> 25:09.680]  we're in.
[25:09.680 --> 25:15.960]  Oh because we're letting you choose, no you're not choosing, you're following a super eugenics
[25:15.960 --> 25:25.440]  based humanity ending program and bragging about it.
[25:25.440 --> 25:27.920]  Now I was going to come back in this segment and I was going to get to this later but everybody
[25:27.920 --> 25:30.960]  knows my habit of mentioning something coming up and getting right into it but when we come
[25:30.960 --> 25:36.560]  back constitutional lawyer, really smart cookie, founder of Oath Cook Keepers is going to be
[25:36.560 --> 25:40.880]  joining us, Stuart Rhodes.
[25:40.880 --> 25:45.680]  But here's the bottom line and he's a constitutional lawyer, won awards at Yale for his writings
[25:45.680 --> 25:50.720]  and of course worked for Ron Paul, smart guy, he concurs with what I've said.
[25:50.720 --> 25:55.800]  Trump essentially is no longer the president, he has advocated his responsibility, he's
[25:55.800 --> 25:59.720]  signing it away, he's letting group of people around him tell him that he can't fire the
[25:59.720 --> 26:04.680]  head of the fellow reserve which he can do in the code, he says we're going to get our
[26:04.680 --> 26:11.400]  troops out of Syria, they say no you can't do that, he says I'm going to declassify
[26:11.400 --> 26:15.200]  the illegal spying on me, no you can't do that.
[26:15.200 --> 26:18.920]  And so for all intents and purposes, he's done a lot of bold stuff, get us out of the
[26:18.920 --> 26:25.120]  TPP, he's done a lot of positive things, fired the head of the World Bank who's a CHICOM
[26:25.120 --> 26:30.120]  operative, we know he was.
[26:30.120 --> 26:36.440]  But when it comes to him trying to really do key things like defend our country and defend
[26:36.440 --> 26:44.400]  ourselves from the UN funded run, public invasion plan to collapse every major nation state,
[26:44.400 --> 26:48.120]  he hires the people that supposedly are experts, it's in it like Kelly and then Kelly won't
[26:48.120 --> 26:52.760]  do it and then lies to him.
[26:52.760 --> 26:57.960]  And they're using hardcore intelligence agency operations and manuals against him and they're
[26:57.960 --> 27:02.200]  messing with his whole family and they're threatening and they're trying to destroy him
[27:02.200 --> 27:05.560]  and they're scaring everybody around him to put pressure on him so I don't want to be
[27:05.560 --> 27:10.640]  in his position and he's under legendary stress and I say pray for the president but we all
[27:10.640 --> 27:16.400]  have to get down to brass tax here, this is a 12 round heavyweight boxing match and Trump
[27:16.400 --> 27:22.600]  is tied right now and both contenders have got broken noses, eyebrows opened up, blood
[27:22.600 --> 27:28.160]  coming out of their mouths and they're both leaning on the ropes.
[27:28.160 --> 27:33.080]  So it goes either way, he's either going to be the liberator and he's going to drop the
[27:33.080 --> 27:38.520]  hammer or he's going to go down because they're cutting him off, all the talk show hosts that's
[27:38.520 --> 27:45.320]  supporting, all the money that supports him, everything's being cut off ahead of assassination
[27:45.320 --> 27:50.200]  or him being impeached and then removed.
[27:50.200 --> 27:55.200]  And folks are like oh well that'll be a spectacle, no, everywhere the authoritarian governments
[27:55.200 --> 28:02.120]  are dropping the hammer in Europe, they're saying just we're going to ban demonstrations
[28:02.120 --> 28:08.560]  period by any conservative or nationalist group and now they have police checkpoints
[28:08.560 --> 28:11.760]  where there's a video of it on infowars.com where they come up in Germany and France and
[28:11.760 --> 28:16.800]  say are you a nationalist, you're a right winger and the women are like well no, you've
[28:16.800 --> 28:23.320]  got your hair braided.
[28:23.320 --> 28:27.080]  And the truth is you're a white person in Germany, that's not allowed and you see how
[28:27.080 --> 28:31.760]  people love to race war, so they're just flipping it now, perfect for the Germans where now
[28:31.760 --> 28:36.400]  it's get the white people and I see on Twitter it's saying ban the German language, people
[28:36.400 --> 28:42.920]  now believe that's Nazi, there's an article right there, if people even have German football
[28:42.920 --> 28:47.280]  teams, in fact the EU has said they're going to ban country names starting in two years
[28:47.280 --> 28:53.480]  on all the soccer teams, you see this is it folks, this is a total cult takeover and we
[28:53.480 --> 28:58.240]  better realize we're in the fight for our lives and it's real authoritarian.
[28:58.240 --> 29:05.080]  And wolfhillamo.com we love shotguns, we offer the best specialty shotgun ammo on the market

[30:22.680 --> 30:29.680]  Thank you for watching Silver Lungs Generator, we'll see you in the next video.
[30:52.680 --> 31:04.640]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[31:04.640 --> 31:09.360]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[31:09.360 --> 31:10.860]  to detoxify the body.
[31:10.860 --> 31:15.720]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[31:15.720 --> 31:20.920]  It's made in the USA, it's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[31:20.920 --> 31:26.280]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the M4, it is a classical 360 win.
[31:26.280 --> 31:30.760]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[31:30.760 --> 31:35.560]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[31:35.560 --> 31:36.560]  get.
[31:36.560 --> 31:39.640]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this
[31:39.640 --> 31:44.680]  country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[31:44.680 --> 31:49.920]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[31:49.920 --> 31:52.600]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[31:52.600 --> 31:55.920]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[31:55.920 --> 32:00.120]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield and infowarslife.com.
[32:00.120 --> 32:04.040]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[32:04.040 --> 32:08.560]  The real drama can be found here in Lailania states, but a lot of us on the Big Island
[32:08.560 --> 32:14.000]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[32:14.000 --> 32:19.360]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[32:19.360 --> 32:20.920]  to unhealthy levels.
[32:20.920 --> 32:27.440]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[32:27.440 --> 32:31.400]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[32:31.400 --> 32:32.880]  in the rainwater.
[32:32.880 --> 32:38.120]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy
[32:38.120 --> 32:44.200]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[32:44.200 --> 32:49.840]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[32:49.840 --> 32:55.160]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[32:55.160 --> 33:04.040]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[33:04.040 --> 33:22.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:22.080 --> 33:44.600]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:44.600 --> 33:47.360]  This is not a sensational headliner statement.
[33:47.360 --> 33:53.960]  It's the fact President Trump is essentially no longer the president.
[33:53.960 --> 33:59.520]  He is advocating his responsibility.
[33:59.520 --> 34:05.640]  He is being countermanded by his subordinates.
[34:05.640 --> 34:11.600]  He is being gelded and isolated and all of his supporters being cut off and silenced ahead
[34:11.600 --> 34:15.840]  of assassination or removal from office.
[34:15.840 --> 34:17.880]  And you say, well, why would they remove a puppet?
[34:17.880 --> 34:22.480]  Well, because his rhetoric they don't like and he's still fighting hard.
[34:22.480 --> 34:27.680]  You know, Tucker Carlson about three weeks ago came out and said, I really like Trump.
[34:27.680 --> 34:30.440]  I think he means well, but he doesn't know what he's doing.
[34:30.440 --> 34:33.760]  He doesn't understand how Washington works and they're running circles around him.
[34:33.760 --> 34:34.760]  He means well.
[34:34.760 --> 34:40.640]  He's gotten a lot done just because he's outside the box and gets that he's the president.
[34:40.640 --> 34:45.880]  But he says, pull the trips out that you say, no, we're not doing it.
[34:45.880 --> 34:49.440]  He says, we're a release the Pfizer documents, the illegal spying.
[34:49.440 --> 34:50.920]  They won't do it.
[34:50.920 --> 34:53.760]  Pence and he and other signals, hey, we're already in an emergency.
[34:53.760 --> 34:55.080]  I made a clear an emergency.
[34:55.080 --> 34:58.480]  And the word was they, he's already said to the military, we're in an emergency on the
[34:58.480 --> 34:59.480]  border.
[34:59.480 --> 35:01.520]  Get down there and he announced we're in an emergency a few weeks ago.
[35:01.520 --> 35:08.240]  But the technical emergency under law, Obama put in a string of executive orders starting
[35:08.240 --> 35:15.120]  in 2009, the biggest 2012 saying we're in a national emergency and telling Congress
[35:15.120 --> 35:20.040]  that and the president then acted under those emergency powers and the Senator Manchin and
[35:20.040 --> 35:25.320]  others said, who's a Democrat, Trump has the power to do it yesterday on Fox said, I don't
[35:25.320 --> 35:26.320]  know if he'll do it.
[35:26.320 --> 35:30.120]  And if Congress thinks the president has too much power, they should take it.
[35:30.120 --> 35:32.720]  They should pass some laws, but too much power has been seated.
[35:32.720 --> 35:33.720]  Okay.
[35:33.720 --> 35:37.720]  Well, they've been using the power to bring us into this globalist system.
[35:37.720 --> 35:44.160]  Trump issues the power to pull us out of it, but he didn't do it.
[35:44.160 --> 35:45.160]  He balked.
[35:45.160 --> 35:48.040]  Now, maybe he's going to do it in a few weeks, but you know, a few weeks turns into a few
[35:48.040 --> 35:52.720]  months like declassifying the illegal spying on him.
[35:52.720 --> 35:55.800]  I even heard Trump a month ago go, well, the Federal Reserve separate, so I'm really not
[35:55.800 --> 35:56.960]  supposed to get involved in that.
[35:56.960 --> 35:57.960]  That's their propaganda.
[35:57.960 --> 35:59.560]  That's the Federal Reserve Act.
[35:59.560 --> 36:00.680]  That's not part of our country.
[36:00.680 --> 36:03.800]  The president can remove the head of the Fed for any reason he wants.
[36:03.800 --> 36:05.280]  It's in there.
[36:05.280 --> 36:10.320]  So he's surrounded by people that are lying to him and who are countermanning what he
[36:10.320 --> 36:11.320]  says.
[36:11.320 --> 36:14.320]  And so I say this to all the listeners, everybody else, you need to call the White House, you
[36:14.320 --> 36:18.440]  need to write letters, you need to call talk radio, get the talking point out there, why
[36:18.440 --> 36:22.720]  they want to soft air is because we can put these talking points out.
[36:22.720 --> 36:28.280]  That Trump is no longer the president when he acts like this and he's lying to be surrounded
[36:28.280 --> 36:33.200]  and cut off, but he can always before it's too late, slip back in and start exercising
[36:33.200 --> 36:34.200]  that rightful power.
[36:34.200 --> 36:38.400]  This is, so many people spend this Stuart, Stuart Rhodes, founder of Health Keepers,
[36:38.400 --> 36:43.840]  constitutional lawyer, army veteran, folks don't know who he is.
[36:43.840 --> 36:44.840]  You're constitutional lawyer.
[36:44.840 --> 36:45.840]  I've studied this.
[36:45.840 --> 36:46.840]  We know what's going on.
[36:46.840 --> 36:47.840]  We know about the executive order.
[36:47.840 --> 36:49.760]  We're going to go over it in this segment in the next.
[36:49.760 --> 36:56.160]  But sitting back from this, what do you think the president needs to do?
[36:56.160 --> 36:57.160]  What did you make of that speech?
[36:57.160 --> 36:59.000]  Why do you think he reversed course?
[36:59.000 --> 37:02.880]  Do you think I'm going too far saying for all of this and purposes he's no longer the
[37:02.880 --> 37:04.840]  president when he acts like this?
[37:04.840 --> 37:08.080]  And then what needs to happen to those that aren't following his orders and then others
[37:08.080 --> 37:11.200]  spend it and say, oh, we're calling for martial law.
[37:11.200 --> 37:12.200]  We're calling for civil emergency.
[37:12.200 --> 37:14.320]  You know, we're already under the emergency.
[37:14.320 --> 37:19.880]  As you know, under law, the president has to clear his own just to end the previous emergency.
[37:19.880 --> 37:21.920]  So how do we articulate that?
[37:21.920 --> 37:24.920]  What do you think is happening with Trump and how serious is the situation?
[37:24.920 --> 37:29.640]  Well, as we discussed last night, I was very disappointed that he didn't do what needs
[37:29.640 --> 37:30.640]  to be done.
[37:30.640 --> 37:35.120]  What he needs to do is recognize this is a military national emergency on our southern
[37:35.120 --> 37:36.120]  border.
[37:36.120 --> 37:41.720]  And he needs to directly draw parallel to the president of President Wilson in 1916 sending
[37:41.720 --> 37:47.840]  the U.S. Army across the border into Mexico to go chase down Pancho Villa and his bandits.
[37:47.840 --> 37:50.840]  The U.S. military was stationed all along the border in Texas.
[37:50.840 --> 37:55.520]  This is after Texas statehood, long after the Civil War, long after Pasi Comitatus.
[37:55.520 --> 37:59.760]  None of that impacts national security when it comes to using the U.S. military to repel
[37:59.760 --> 38:00.760]  invasion.
[38:00.760 --> 38:05.160]  And so the president should just focus directly on that precedent and say, look, under the
[38:05.160 --> 38:10.600]  constitutional authority I have as commander in chief, I am authorized to repel invasions
[38:10.600 --> 38:13.720]  to suppress insurrection and execute the laws of the union.
[38:13.720 --> 38:17.480]  And I can use the U.S. military to do so as commander in chief, but he needs to turn to
[38:17.480 --> 38:22.120]  his defense department and give out the order to go and deploy the military on the border
[38:22.120 --> 38:23.120]  in force.
[38:23.120 --> 38:29.160]  Not in a support role, not here and there, but in mass, as was done by Wilson in reaction
[38:29.160 --> 38:30.160]  to Pancho Villa.
[38:30.160 --> 38:34.640]  He sent an expeditionary force, an opinionative expedition into Mexico to go take it to the
[38:34.640 --> 38:35.640]  bandits.
[38:35.640 --> 38:37.840]  And today we're in the same situation again.
[38:37.840 --> 38:42.400]  You have, in that situation, you had Pancho Villa and his men who controlled northern
[38:42.400 --> 38:43.400]  Mexico.
[38:43.400 --> 38:46.680]  They were the de facto rulers of northern Mexico in the Civil War against the Mexican
[38:46.680 --> 38:48.600]  government, against Mexico City.
[38:48.600 --> 38:52.520]  And they didn't wait for Mexico City's permission, you know, Wilson set the troops across the
[38:52.520 --> 38:53.520]  border.
[38:53.520 --> 38:55.320]  He didn't wait for Congress' permission or authority.
[38:55.320 --> 39:00.840]  He just did it as the commander in chief in an obvious constitutional response to an invasion
[39:00.840 --> 39:02.560]  of murder of American citizens.
[39:02.560 --> 39:03.560]  Here's the same.
[39:03.560 --> 39:06.880]  The cartels of community of the United States brought illegal aliens in who were their gang
[39:06.880 --> 39:10.920]  banger buddies who then murdered police officers, murder veterans.
[39:10.920 --> 39:14.280]  Last night he talked about, you know, an Air Force veteran who was a female who was raped
[39:14.280 --> 39:16.680]  and murdered, beaten to death with a hammer by a legal alien.
[39:16.680 --> 39:22.040]  Then he had a police officer saying up there, a legal immigrant from Fiji who was murdered
[39:22.040 --> 39:27.560]  by an illegal immigrant under California's protection with their ridiculous sovereign,
[39:27.560 --> 39:30.840]  you know, they call it the Sanctuary City or Sanctuary State Law.
[39:30.840 --> 39:34.440]  So all of this is the same parallel to what we've faced with Pancho Villa.
[39:34.440 --> 39:35.640]  Well, this is a much bigger threat.
[39:35.640 --> 39:37.080]  We got 35 million illegal aliens.
[39:37.080 --> 39:39.160]  They're twice as likely to make crimes.
[39:39.160 --> 39:44.440]  Mexico and Latin America are crime, kidnapping, beheading, murder, paradises, hundreds of
[39:44.440 --> 39:45.440]  thousands of dead.
[39:45.440 --> 39:48.920]  And then you have the Democrats and upside down world saying there's zero crisis in
[39:48.920 --> 39:49.920]  the border.
[39:49.920 --> 39:50.920]  There's nothing happening.
[39:50.920 --> 39:59.920]  You can't admit record numbers of flu, tuberculosis, drug resistant, black plague, even leprosy
[39:59.920 --> 40:01.920]  is coming back.
[40:01.920 --> 40:07.320]  They're putting these kids in schools, untested with other people's kids, worldwide tuberculosis
[40:07.320 --> 40:08.480]  exploding.
[40:08.480 --> 40:11.360]  This is just insane, but it's part of a larger plan.
[40:11.360 --> 40:12.360]  Well, absolutely.
[40:12.360 --> 40:14.440]  And we see it already in Europe.
[40:14.440 --> 40:20.040]  It's, as you said earlier, this is the globalist plan to flood the first world with the third
[40:20.040 --> 40:25.000]  world and swamp it and take it and destroy it and take it down to third world level.
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.040]  And that's what they're doing to us.
[40:27.040 --> 40:30.560]  But it's also a humanitarian crisis for the people being brought across.
[40:30.560 --> 40:35.440]  Trump has not harrowed enough on the sex slavery that goes on both inside Mexico and inside
[40:35.440 --> 40:36.440]  the U.S.
[40:36.440 --> 40:37.440]  Oh, that's another thing.
[40:37.440 --> 40:41.400]  Schumer and all of them said Trump's talking about non-existent sex trafficking when the
[40:41.400 --> 40:46.800]  AP reported on Democrat connected groups sneaking 10,000 kids out of Haiti and some of them
[40:46.800 --> 40:52.440]  found dead and even the Senate reported, Mitch, Obama led in tens of thousands of kids, thousands
[40:52.440 --> 40:54.200]  of which disappeared into sex slavery.
[40:54.200 --> 40:57.040]  I mean, and they're saying there is no Christ on the border.
[40:57.040 --> 40:58.680]  There is no sex slavery.
[40:58.680 --> 41:00.840]  These people are a mad criminal group.
[41:00.840 --> 41:06.240]  It's just, and they look like, I mean, the way Pelosi and Schumer looked, the whole
[41:06.240 --> 41:12.600]  nation recoiled because they look like, like animatomic dummies or something, like they're
[41:12.600 --> 41:13.600]  not real.
[41:13.600 --> 41:15.320]  What the hell is going on here?
[41:15.320 --> 41:20.400]  Well, you know, it's, it's, there's been well documented over the mainstream media for many
[41:20.400 --> 41:27.120]  years of the sad tale of young girls underage being kidnapped, beaten and raped and smoldered
[41:27.120 --> 41:31.720]  into the U.S. and forced to be prostitutes in the sex slavery for the, for the illegal
[41:31.720 --> 41:32.720]  migrant workers.
[41:32.720 --> 41:36.080]  They go to these, these fields and they, and they have to service, you know, 30 minutes
[41:36.080 --> 41:37.760]  of time every day.
[41:37.760 --> 41:41.760]  They're being tortured every day sexually in the United States, brought from Mexico.
[41:41.760 --> 41:42.760]  That's not conspiracy theory.
[41:42.760 --> 41:43.760]  That's not some kind of deal.
[41:43.760 --> 41:45.640]  Let me stop you.
[41:45.640 --> 41:49.040]  CBS was so hyper to lie about Trump with their, with their Senate primary law center fact
[41:49.040 --> 41:51.000]  checkers that they put their foot in their mouth last night.
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.040]  Storiesoninfowars.com will cover when we come back.
[41:53.040 --> 41:58.200]  Stuart, did you see where he said one in three women coming up through Mexico were raped
[41:58.200 --> 42:05.400]  by the coyotes and CBS fact checked him and said, actually, it's, it's 80%, which it is.
[42:05.400 --> 42:07.920]  And so then they had to pull it down.
[42:07.920 --> 42:10.320]  Can you, I mean, can you believe it?
[42:10.320 --> 42:15.160]  Yeah, this, this is, this is, you know, everyone on the border knows.
[42:15.160 --> 42:19.520]  I think the problem is, is most America doesn't realize how bad it really is.
[42:19.520 --> 42:20.520]  It is far worse.
[42:20.520 --> 42:24.280]  I'm a full grown man and I've been down there with folks in Arizona and South Texas and
[42:24.280 --> 42:25.280]  it's scary.
[42:25.280 --> 42:28.320]  It's scary down there.
[42:28.320 --> 42:31.920]  It's far worse than it was going on a bunch of years because they don't, they don't leave.
[42:31.920 --> 42:35.440]  They stay here and they do the same thing here they do in Mexico.
[42:35.440 --> 42:38.880]  They terrorize women and children that force them into sex slavery.
[42:38.880 --> 42:42.320]  If they, if they try to escape, they murder them, let's make an example.
[42:42.320 --> 42:43.320]  Let's be clear.
[42:43.320 --> 42:44.320]  Let's be clear.
[42:44.320 --> 42:48.080]  It's because it's the worst of the worst of Latin America and other places knowing you
[42:48.080 --> 42:52.600]  can go to the United States and no one knows who you are and do whatever the hell you want,
[42:52.600 --> 42:59.880]  like the railway killer who killed 30 something people, all of them Hispanics.

[47:03.480 --> 47:15.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:15.680 --> 47:22.680]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on, for your mind.
[47:22.680 --> 47:32.520]  Stuart Rhodes, constitutional lawyer, army veteran, founder of O Keepers, a good friend
[47:32.520 --> 47:37.160]  of mine, a great patriot, is breaking down the fact that the president is not acting
[47:37.160 --> 47:38.660]  like the president.
[47:38.660 --> 47:41.920]  And we have these bureaucracies ignoring his orders.
[47:41.920 --> 47:47.920]  He's written award-winning papers at Yale, and you name it, about the different structures
[47:47.920 --> 47:50.400]  of power in the executive and the other two branches.
[47:50.400 --> 47:54.480]  We'll get his take on that in a moment, but he was just bringing up the massive human
[47:54.480 --> 47:55.480]  smuggling.
[47:55.480 --> 48:00.080]  We were doing live coverage last night with Stuart and others on, with us, Roger Stone
[48:00.080 --> 48:04.360]  and others, of the aftermath of the president.
[48:04.360 --> 48:12.480]  And the Democrats responded by saying, there's no human smuggling, but those are quotes.
[48:12.480 --> 48:14.080]  And Trump's making it up.
[48:14.080 --> 48:15.600]  There's quote, no border crisis.
[48:15.600 --> 48:18.440]  This is official statements at MSNBC and CNN.
[48:18.440 --> 48:21.920]  I mean, this is otherworldly.
[48:21.920 --> 48:26.360]  This level of BS is so seismic, I don't even know what you call it.
[48:26.360 --> 48:29.480]  It's BS to the power of infinity.
[48:29.480 --> 48:33.920]  The UN even admits, because they're involved, Amos International, 80% of the women that
[48:33.920 --> 48:37.240]  come up through there are raped in Mexico.
[48:37.240 --> 48:38.240]  Not by the gringos.
[48:38.240 --> 48:41.360]  Tens of thousands are put into sex slavery every year.
[48:41.360 --> 48:42.920]  Thousands get killed and disappear.
[48:42.920 --> 48:47.120]  Trump just signed an anti-human smuggling piece of legislation that also goes up for
[48:47.120 --> 48:48.120]  pedophiles.
[48:48.120 --> 48:52.160]  Pedophile arrests are up nine to 10 times, according to federal numbers, what they were
[48:52.160 --> 48:53.400]  under Obama.
[48:53.400 --> 48:59.880]  But there's a cover of magazines, like Texas Monthly, say, Jones is insane.
[48:59.880 --> 49:04.360]  There's no pedophilia with a picture of myself and Trump up there.
[49:04.360 --> 49:06.800]  And then it says, pizza gate isn't real.
[49:06.800 --> 49:08.440]  There's no pedophilia.
[49:08.440 --> 49:11.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, Trump just signed the legislation.
[49:11.280 --> 49:12.280]  So he is taking action.
[49:12.280 --> 49:13.480]  He is the president.
[49:13.480 --> 49:17.320]  But compared to the real powers he has as commander-in-chief, when he puts that hat on
[49:17.320 --> 49:21.160]  in an emergency, both domestic or foreign, that's what scares the deep state, because
[49:21.160 --> 49:24.520]  he could brush them aside if he just does it.
[49:24.520 --> 49:29.680]  Instead of doing it, he leaves it in the big battle with Congress and leaves Obama's
[49:29.680 --> 49:31.160]  emergency in place.
[49:31.160 --> 49:32.400]  And I know he knows this.
[49:32.400 --> 49:36.200]  So we'll get Stuart's take on it and what he thinks we should do and also how the military
[49:36.200 --> 49:37.680]  could build a wall very, very quickly.
[49:37.680 --> 49:39.400]  Stuart's an expert on this.
[49:39.400 --> 49:40.400]  We'll get to that.
[49:40.400 --> 49:43.960]  But here's the president just minutes ago signing the anti-trafficking legislation.
[49:43.960 --> 50:01.320]  All right, very much to it, thank you.
[50:01.320 --> 50:12.320]  Stuart, this is incredible.
[50:12.320 --> 50:15.620]  Let's get back to the traffic and how to build a wall.
[50:15.620 --> 50:20.280]  We know the United States is arguably the biggest place in the world for human trafficking
[50:20.280 --> 50:24.680]  because of our poorest borders, if not number one or number two.
[50:24.680 --> 50:28.040]  The Democrats, I have the stacks of news, I have video clips, mainstream media saying
[50:28.040 --> 50:29.160]  it doesn't exist.
[50:29.160 --> 50:30.640]  There is no human trafficking.
[50:30.640 --> 50:32.240]  There is no crime.
[50:32.240 --> 50:33.320]  There is no caravan.
[50:33.320 --> 50:35.680]  These are all, what the hell is going on here?
[50:35.680 --> 50:38.920]  What is the propaganda program here?
[50:38.920 --> 50:46.080]  Well, they can't admit the truth because then it backs up that this is an emergency and
[50:46.080 --> 50:48.440]  the proper response is to use the military to stop it.
[50:48.440 --> 50:50.080]  So of course, what else can they do?
[50:50.080 --> 50:51.080]  They can deny it.
[50:51.080 --> 50:55.680]  So he should take a page out of Ross Perot's book and get up on in front of the press conference
[50:55.680 --> 50:59.240]  in front of the country and put it up on a big screen and all of the mainstream media
[50:59.240 --> 51:03.920]  reports and interviews of women being sex trafficked when they were children, brought
[51:03.920 --> 51:07.560]  across the country, finally freed and then interviewed because they're all over the
[51:07.560 --> 51:08.560]  place.
[51:08.560 --> 51:09.560]  He should stay them all out.
[51:09.560 --> 51:13.200]  He should show pictures of all the murders that happened both inside Mexico and inside
[51:13.200 --> 51:17.560]  the United States by the cartels and the drug gangs that run the border.
[51:17.560 --> 51:20.840]  And when he goes down to the border tomorrow, he should go to McAllen, Texas.
[51:20.840 --> 51:22.920]  He should go down to Laredo.
[51:22.920 --> 51:25.880]  He should go where, you know, we did a flyover with your crew.
[51:25.880 --> 51:28.760]  Your cameraman came along with me and flew over the Rio Grande.
[51:28.760 --> 51:29.760]  It's wide open.
[51:29.760 --> 51:31.240]  You still have that footage.
[51:31.240 --> 51:32.240]  There's no fence there.
[51:32.240 --> 51:33.680]  There was no board patrol for miles.
[51:33.680 --> 51:38.160]  We flew for about 45 minutes before we saw one board patrol truck.
[51:38.160 --> 51:39.880]  And that's because there's not enough of them down there.
[51:39.880 --> 51:42.360]  And then we did boots on the ground walking along the Rio Grande.
[51:42.360 --> 51:43.840]  You wouldn't even know it's a border.
[51:43.840 --> 51:47.280]  There's nothing to indicate any kind of international border whatsoever.
[51:47.280 --> 51:50.480]  And we were there for about 45 minutes, me and a Marine Corps veteran who lives there
[51:50.480 --> 51:52.800]  before we saw any board patrol agents.
[51:52.800 --> 51:55.040]  They were just not there because there's not enough of them.
[51:55.040 --> 52:00.040]  And we've got footage of giant packages of drugs being brought across while we're there.
[52:00.040 --> 52:01.040]  Yeah.
[52:01.040 --> 52:02.040]  Yeah.
[52:02.040 --> 52:03.040]  That's right.
[52:03.040 --> 52:05.680]  You guys had, I think it was Joe Gibbs or Biggs, right?
[52:05.680 --> 52:09.360]  He saw the caravan come right across right in front of him with some mule trains.
[52:09.360 --> 52:13.680]  And so they bring drugs, they bring weapons, they bring women and children for sex slavery,
[52:13.680 --> 52:14.680]  they bring across terrorists.
[52:14.680 --> 52:17.280]  I mean, anything that they want to bring comes across.
[52:17.280 --> 52:19.640]  And the cartels control that border.
[52:19.640 --> 52:21.320]  They control both sides of it.
[52:21.320 --> 52:26.000]  The gangs on the U.S. side who work for the cartels, some of them American citizens, others
[52:26.000 --> 52:30.880]  of them illegal aliens, are the ones who distribute the drugs and take them up to Chicago for
[52:30.880 --> 52:31.880]  the cartels.
[52:31.880 --> 52:35.040]  And on the Mexican side, it's bloodthirsty cartels themselves.
[52:35.040 --> 52:36.800]  So they control the border right now.
[52:36.800 --> 52:40.360]  You're already being invaded and occupied and you have corrupt sheriffs down there
[52:40.360 --> 52:44.640]  and police chiefs and city council members who were in the back pocket of the cartel
[52:44.640 --> 52:49.840]  because it's a standard drill, either, you know, plato or plomo, either silver or lead.
[52:49.840 --> 52:51.640]  You take the money or they kill you.
[52:51.640 --> 52:55.280]  That's what's happening inside the U.S. as it does in Mexico.
[52:55.280 --> 52:57.800]  There is no border and there will not be a border.
[52:57.800 --> 52:58.800]  But wait a minute.
[52:58.800 --> 53:02.040]  Chuck E. Schumer and all of them, I have literally dozens of clips today and yesterday
[53:02.040 --> 53:03.920]  saying there is no caravan.
[53:03.920 --> 53:04.920]  There are no drugs.
[53:04.920 --> 53:06.200]  There's no sex trafficking.
[53:06.200 --> 53:09.680]  And then Amnesty International says 80% of the women are getting raped.
[53:09.680 --> 53:13.120]  Trump says one-third, they fact check it and say, you're wrong.
[53:13.120 --> 53:14.120]  It's more women.
[53:14.120 --> 53:16.800]  They go, oops, sorry, and pull it down.
[53:16.800 --> 53:17.800]  It's crazy.
[53:17.800 --> 53:20.560]  That's why you should just take the time to do a press conference where he lays it all
[53:20.560 --> 53:25.360]  out there using their own reports, Amnesty International's reports, the UN's reports,
[53:25.360 --> 53:28.360]  no documented government reports about the reality on the border.
[53:28.360 --> 53:29.360]  Here are the facts.
[53:29.360 --> 53:32.960]  I mean, the web page they have up about border facts is pretty good, but he used to get
[53:32.960 --> 53:35.240]  up there in front of the people and show it to the people.
[53:35.240 --> 53:37.880]  And then he needs to point out that Wilson did this.
[53:37.880 --> 53:41.560]  Here's Blackjack perishing in Mexico chasing down Pancho Villa.
[53:41.560 --> 53:42.560]  Here's why.
[53:42.560 --> 53:43.560]  This is perfectly constitutional.
[53:43.560 --> 53:47.680]  And in fact, you know, my duty as the president of the United States to use a military to
[53:47.680 --> 53:48.680]  do this.
[53:48.680 --> 53:51.600]  And then he needs to go ahead and just do it right there from the state and get it done.
[53:51.600 --> 53:52.600]  It's issue of the order.
[53:52.600 --> 53:53.600]  You're a smart guy.
[53:53.600 --> 53:54.600]  You've worked in Congress.
[53:54.600 --> 53:55.600]  You're a constitutional lawyer.
[53:55.600 --> 53:59.040]  They were signaling, but the vice president of the president declared an emergency.
[53:59.040 --> 54:02.520]  It's the right thing to do not just for the border, but for what he can do in government
[54:02.520 --> 54:05.000]  once he does that for good.
[54:05.000 --> 54:06.080]  And it's in his purview.
[54:06.080 --> 54:10.400]  Why do you think he then, because I'm really wrong and it's fine when I am, I'll say I
[54:10.400 --> 54:12.000]  am, but I'm not even wrong.
[54:12.000 --> 54:15.760]  He says we're going to pull out of Syria and they don't do it because they say, no, we're
[54:15.760 --> 54:16.760]  not doing it.
[54:16.760 --> 54:17.760]  They're countermanding.
[54:17.760 --> 54:19.720]  So what do you think the president should do?
[54:19.720 --> 54:23.640]  And do you agree with me that, you know, we're seeing him kind of not hit on all cylinders.
[54:23.640 --> 54:26.520]  He does some good things, but other times he just gets blocked.
[54:26.520 --> 54:27.520]  It's amazing.
[54:27.520 --> 54:28.520]  Yeah.
[54:28.520 --> 54:29.520]  He needs to fire.
[54:29.520 --> 54:34.200]  He refuses one of his orders, um, what's a lawful order should be fired immediately.
[54:34.200 --> 54:37.240]  And he needs to make that very clear that you either do what I say or gone.
[54:37.240 --> 54:39.240]  He can't go back on what he says he's going to do.
[54:39.240 --> 54:41.040]  He just needs to do it.
[54:41.040 --> 54:42.040]  So that's what he has to do.
[54:42.040 --> 54:43.040]  He has to man up.
[54:43.040 --> 54:46.000]  I mean, and I'm going to kind of refer back to what you were saying earlier that that's
[54:46.000 --> 54:51.000]  it's part of their program to make us all despair and give up.
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.520]  And obviously they're doing that to him as well.
[54:53.520 --> 54:57.840]  That's why it's so important for us to make sure that we stand up and let our voices be
[54:57.840 --> 55:02.840]  heard and we go put our boots on the ground in DC, calling on the president to man up.
[55:02.840 --> 55:04.120]  We got a man up too.
[55:04.120 --> 55:05.120]  And don't give up.
[55:05.120 --> 55:08.640]  I saw some comments on your website after last night of people saying that they're giving
[55:08.640 --> 55:09.640]  up.
[55:09.640 --> 55:10.640]  Trump's Trump's not going to do anything.
[55:10.640 --> 55:11.640]  Our country's cooked.
[55:11.640 --> 55:13.960]  It doesn't make a difference what Trump does or doesn't do.
[55:13.960 --> 55:14.960]  What matters is what you do.
[55:14.960 --> 55:15.960]  Oh yeah.
[55:15.960 --> 55:16.960]  Nancy Pelosi is so toned up.
[55:16.960 --> 55:21.000]  She doesn't know that she looks like the Crip Keeper and same thing with Schumer.
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.080]  They have this evil criminal will to dominate us.
[55:23.080 --> 55:26.520]  But if we just persevere, look how far the movement against globalism has come.
[55:26.520 --> 55:27.520]  Look at Trump.
[55:27.520 --> 55:28.520]  Yes, we're frustrated.
[55:28.520 --> 55:31.800]  He doesn't just defeat them right now and he has the power in his hands, but he's working
[55:31.800 --> 55:34.840]  with a bunch of cowards that backstab, but you're absolutely right.
[55:34.840 --> 55:36.960]  Don't let them demoralize you, folks.
[55:36.960 --> 55:38.920]  Don't let them demoralize you.
[55:38.920 --> 55:41.040]  Nationalism and patriotism is exploring worldwide.
[55:41.040 --> 55:42.040]  Okay.
[55:42.040 --> 55:43.040]  Yeah.
[55:43.040 --> 55:45.560]  The American Psychological Association say men are evil.
[55:45.560 --> 55:46.760]  Well, that shows us they're evil.
[55:46.760 --> 55:48.400]  They're being honest about their plan.
[55:48.400 --> 55:52.400]  They're accelerating their timetable to bring down civilization for control because we're
[55:52.400 --> 55:53.400]  kicking their butt.
[55:53.400 --> 56:00.080]  Yeah, and the best response is to go and man up, you know, take your testosterone pills,
[56:00.080 --> 56:04.920]  lift some weights, go run some sprints up a hill, go learn how to fight and man up, lose
[56:04.920 --> 56:05.920]  some weight.
[56:05.920 --> 56:09.520]  You know, this last year I lost 40 pounds, got my fat ass back in shape and that's what
[56:09.520 --> 56:13.840]  we all need to do is just man up and see our responsibilities as individuals to make sure
[56:13.840 --> 56:15.880]  that we do what we have to do.
[56:15.880 --> 56:17.840]  And they're telling you what they don't want you to do.
[56:17.840 --> 56:19.680]  They don't want you to be a man anymore.
[56:19.680 --> 56:20.680]  So be a man.
[56:20.680 --> 56:21.680]  Exactly.
[56:21.680 --> 56:22.680]  What are they scared of?
[56:22.680 --> 56:23.680]  They don't want you to go to infowars.com.
[56:23.680 --> 56:24.680]  They don't want you to be a Christian.
[56:24.680 --> 56:26.160]  They don't want you to be a nationalist.
[56:26.160 --> 56:28.080]  They don't want you to be a man.
[56:28.080 --> 56:31.840]  They don't want a woman to be a mother because they're demoralizing you because they are
[56:31.840 --> 56:34.160]  literally the scum of the earth.
[56:34.160 --> 56:37.320]  Do you believe the American Psychological Association has literally come out and said
[56:37.320 --> 56:40.080]  men in traditional roles period are bad?
[56:40.080 --> 56:42.480]  We know that's been their plan, but now it's public.
[56:42.480 --> 56:47.480]  Yeah, I encourage you as a New Year's resolution, you know, read Jaco Woolick's book, Discipline
[56:47.480 --> 56:48.480]  is Freedom.
[56:48.480 --> 56:52.760]  That's a great book about, you know, getting your act together mentally and physically
[56:52.760 --> 56:53.760]  and becoming men again.
[56:53.760 --> 56:56.200]  I think it's really, really important to focus on that.
[56:56.200 --> 56:57.640]  But we also need to push the president.
[56:57.640 --> 57:01.280]  We need to make sure we don't give him pass last, from what he did last night.
[57:01.280 --> 57:03.200]  Don't say, well, you know, it's not his fault.
[57:03.200 --> 57:07.840]  He's surrounded by eight by five, you know, whatever enemies and they're in his ear,
[57:07.840 --> 57:09.240]  et cetera, et cetera.
[57:09.240 --> 57:10.240]  He's responsible.
[57:10.240 --> 57:12.160]  He needs to accept responsibility.
[57:12.160 --> 57:14.840]  Every one of us is responsible for what we do.
[57:14.840 --> 57:16.160]  And he's responsible also.
[57:16.160 --> 57:19.760]  I don't care what threats they're doing against his family or anything else.
[57:19.760 --> 57:21.080]  He swore that oath.
[57:21.080 --> 57:24.160]  Once he swore an oath, his support and defend the constitution, he's on the hook.
[57:24.160 --> 57:25.320]  He's on the hook from now on.
[57:25.320 --> 57:27.080]  And all he can do is do his duty.
[57:27.080 --> 57:28.800]  So all we can do too.
[57:28.800 --> 57:31.560]  Well, plus Stuart, look at what we face.
[57:31.560 --> 57:33.800]  I know you've got to do another interview in about five minutes, but do five more with
[57:33.800 --> 57:35.800]  us back in two.
[57:35.800 --> 57:37.560]  How could the military build a wall very, very quickly?
[57:37.560 --> 57:38.880]  I know you're an expert on this.
[57:38.880 --> 57:42.520]  You spent thousands of hours on the border, more than thousands of hours, and we're going
[57:42.520 --> 57:43.520]  to break it all down.
[57:43.520 --> 57:44.520]  We come right back.
[57:44.520 --> 57:49.600]  Let's get straight ahead.
[57:49.600 --> 57:52.920]  Defeat the globalist, hashtag Alex Jones.
[57:52.920 --> 57:56.480]  Defeat the pedophiles, hashtag Alex Jones.
[57:56.480 --> 58:01.440]  Defeat Alexander Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[58:01.440 --> 58:05.000]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[58:05.000 --> 58:09.080]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there, but we've just gotten stronger
[58:09.080 --> 58:13.720]  because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[58:13.720 --> 58:18.520]  I am patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the censors now and if
[58:18.520 --> 58:24.040]  all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[58:24.040 --> 58:27.960]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[58:27.960 --> 58:33.920]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[58:33.920 --> 58:38.600]  Call and talk radio, C-span, shout it out loud in public, hashtag Alex Jones.
[58:38.600 --> 58:44.040]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[58:44.040 --> 58:49.400]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[58:49.400 --> 58:55.160]  Please, whatever you do realize, we're all getting punch-drunk to the censorship and
[58:55.160 --> 58:58.360]  you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say affiliated with Info Wars.
[58:58.360 --> 59:02.120]  Yes, some of them are like little side accounts, they even know we had like Info Wars stores
[59:02.120 --> 59:06.440]  that just showed our products, but they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that
[59:06.440 --> 59:10.280]  I be in a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[59:10.280 --> 59:13.800]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country
[59:13.800 --> 59:18.640]  and the world back from the brink, but the globalists now want to target where the resistance
[59:18.640 --> 59:21.520]  came from so that we're not pesky in the future.
[59:21.520 --> 59:27.280]  I want to be troublesome and pesky, I want to keep going, I want to make them do the
[59:27.280 --> 59:31.560]  ultimate not just destroy us financially, I want to push all the way.
[59:31.560 --> 59:35.720]  I've committed to do that, I've prayed for that and I've been told that's going to happen,
[59:35.720 --> 59:40.720]  but you've got a back-ish and I promise you this, I will never falter, I will never waver
[59:40.720 --> 59:45.280]  at the spiritual level, I physically will, but I give you my commitment if you financially
[59:45.280 --> 59:53.520]  support us at foreshore.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[59:53.520 --> 01:00:09.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:31.240]  This country is under globalist U.N. attack, they publicly admit they're using giant
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:36.560]  immigrant hordes to break down nations, I mean socialist voters in Europe and the U.S.
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:42.280]  revealed U.N. plan to flood America with 600 million migrants in forewars.com, official
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:47.880]  U.N. documents, Stewart Road, Oathkeepers.org, great guy, great patriot, constitutional
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:48.880]  lawyer, veteran.
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:56.760]  In the time we have left here to go over this, tell folks, Stewart Roads, how the president
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:58.440]  could secure the border using the military.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:04.040]  Well, what he could do is take a page out of Wilson's book and just deploy the military
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.040]  on the border.
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:09.400]  I'm not talking about support, I'm talking about one infantry unit, Springcourt Army
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.000]  on the border patrol.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.840]  And I've talked to a very experienced border patrol agent just yesterday, in fact, who
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:20.040]  said that a precedent for us, we did back in operation gatekeeper in the 90s, where
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:25.320]  the border patrol beefed up from 500 men in the San Diego sector to 5,000, and they locked
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.320]  up the border there.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:30.960]  And they did it with a layered system of a border barrier, a steel fence, the matting
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:31.960]  they used.
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:37.960]  And they put behind that a road that could be easily, you know, checked for footprints
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:41.600]  and they'd drag and make it clean again and make it check for footprints and then a fence
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:44.760]  and then behind that another blank area and then another fence.
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:48.400]  Then they had quick reaction teams that would then respond in case anyone made it through
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:49.400]  all three fences.
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.680]  That's what it takes as a layered system.
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:56.200]  With the military, you could easily do it with U.S. military troops on the border now
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:01.200]  and locking it up in a layered system of quick reaction forces and helicopters in trucks
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.320]  and on foot.
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:05.600]  And then you can also use the Army Corps of Engineers to build the barriers.
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:09.080]  Some places more difficult than others, but you can build whatever barriers available
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.080]  to be built there.
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.080]  Well, sure.
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:14.960]  And the feds have put up cameras everywhere you can imagine except the border.
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:19.640]  It's very inexpensive and cheap now to just put in cameras, like you said, helicopters.
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:22.440]  And then all you do is slow people down, you have sands, so you see where the footprints
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:23.440]  are.
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:24.800]  And then all you do is pick up the groups that come through.
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:28.720]  That's why they're trying to use mass wave attacks that the U.N. is organizing to try
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:34.360]  to overwhelm the entire system and then have images of our border broken to encourage the
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:36.600]  third world to swarm us, which is now happening.
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:40.200]  We're seeing the biggest numbers of illegals hitting our borders we've ever seen.
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:45.440]  Well, actually, I think the day-to-day grind across the entire border is already overwhelming
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:46.440]  the border patrol.
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:47.920]  There's simply not enough of them.
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:53.040]  And they have cameras along the McAllen sector, Laredo's sector, they've got long, tall poles
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:56.000]  with cameras on them, but they don't have enough men to react.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.800]  It doesn't make a difference how many cameras you have, whether you have any blimps or drones.
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:02.880]  You've got to have enough men to react to go actually interdict.
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:07.040]  And that's what they're missing, is the manpower, which you could easily do with a hundred-first
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:11.040]  airborne to go down there with their helicopters and be a QRF force, the U.S. Marine Corps
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:14.680]  to go down there, and very easily interdict with enough manpower to get there.
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:15.880]  By the way, I'm not saying do this.
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:18.800]  I'm saying don't do it, even on a Guardian Mets.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:23.320]  Mexico's controlled its Guatemalan border until the U.N. just broke it last year by torturing
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:24.320]  people.
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:28.560]  But six months to a year, hard labor, and they tortured the living hell out of you repeatedly
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:30.400]  when they capture you and when they let you go.
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:34.680]  And that's what kept people from doing it, was they were afraid of the Mexican federales.
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:35.680]  Now they're not afraid.
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:38.720]  The U.N. is effectively broken Mexico's border.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:44.200]  Well, and frankly, what I think Trump should do is deploy the military into Mexico.
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:47.920]  He should point out that Mexico does not control his border any longer than the cartels.
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:48.920]  So failed state.
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:50.920]  So what, movement, 10 miles, 20 miles?
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:53.800]  Yeah, 10 or 20 miles, go in after the cartels.
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:56.320]  Seize all the major roads, wipe out all the cartels.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.320]  No, I agree.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.320]  That's what the Blackjack did.
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:59.320]  It needs to be done.
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.320]  He did.
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:03.200]  Go down there and take it to the cartels, clean them out.
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:06.160]  And by doing that, you're now on Mexican soil.
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.840]  You're no longer on U.S. soil.
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:11.080]  And by the way, we're not going to send even police, military, public rains to get killed
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.080]  with the cartels.
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:16.280]  We just use satellites and human intel to mark all their houses and known cartels.
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:19.200]  We just send in C-130 gunships and kill them all in three hours.
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:23.320]  Couldn't they take out a couple hundred targets across three or four states just a few hours?
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.320]  Yeah.
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:27.880]  You have to be mindful of making sure you're not killing innocent people, women and children
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:28.880]  who have been kidnapped.
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:32.520]  Who are killed by the hundreds of thousands, well then, well then, I mean, the job of going
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:35.920]  into each of those houses, then we'll be high casualties, but I guess just send the Marines
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:36.920]  in, huh?
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:37.920]  Yeah.
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:38.920]  So they could do that quite well.
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:39.920]  They're pretty good.
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:41.920]  I think they've done it a few times in Mexico, right?
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:42.920]  Yeah.
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:43.920]  I was in Montezuma, right?
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:44.920]  Yeah.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:45.920]  All right.
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:46.920]  Hey, great job, my friend.
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:47.920]  God bless you.
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:48.920]  We're going to win in the end.
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:49.920]  Don't let them demoralize the Stewart roads.
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:50.920]  Oakkeepers.org.
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:51.920]  Check it out and support him.
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:52.920]  God bless you.
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:53.920]  I think they're good.
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:54.920]  Okay.
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:05:02.560]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:06.560]  Info wars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with

[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:06.120]  There is no government official here, but I'll say that the press is not the enemy
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:12.120]  of the people.
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:29.120]  The press is not the enemy of the people, the press is not the enemy of the people.
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:53.480]  Maybe we should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue like these folks who chant CNN sucks and fake
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.480]  news.
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:58.760]  Maybe we should go out, all journalists should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue and chant we're
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:01.000]  not the enemy of the people.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:14.520]  We're not the enemy of the people, we're not the enemy of the people, we're not the
[01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:19.960]  enemy of the people.
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:28.440]  This is CNN.
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:30.440]  How you like me now?
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:32.440]  How you like me now?
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:34.440]  How you like me now?
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:36.440]  You're a radio listener.
[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:38.440]  It's not as powerful as your TV viewers saw it.
[01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:42.440]  I have clips yesterday and today of CNN
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:44.440]  three times
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.440]  MSNBC
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:48.440]  a Pelosi Schumer all of them saying
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:50.440]  there's no human smuggling
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:52.440]  out of Mexico and the U.S.
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:54.440]  when the whole thing is human smuggling.
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:56.440]  Millions a year, tens of thousands of children
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.440]  I've got articles saying
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:00.440]  there's no one trying to take your guns
[01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:02.440]  and the same publication they say
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:04.440]  they're trying to take the guns
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:08.440]  I've got all the U.N. reports admitting
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:10.440]  they're organizing all these migrant waves
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:12.440]  and then meanwhile all over
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:14.440]  the country
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.440]  particularly on the east and west coast
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:18.440]  they are
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:20.440]  confiscating firearms
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:22.440]  with no due process
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:24.440]  and not only just sending police on an errand
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:26.440]  they don't agree with it, it's unlawful
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:28.440]  but it also is dangerous, real dangerous
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:30.440]  the last person I went to
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:32.440]  some neighbor doesn't like an old veteran's got guns
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:34.440]  the veteran's done nothing wrong
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:36.440]  and you try to send the cops over there
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:38.440]  especially on the wrong day of the week
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:40.440]  to take the guy's guns
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:42.440]  it's not going to go well for anybody
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:44.440]  so how about we send the Southern Parvy Law Center
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:46.440]  and Michael Blumberg on those missions
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:48.440]  New Washington gun laws
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:50.440]  spark defiance
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:52.440]  that's out of the KCBY
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:54.440]  and others are reporting on it
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.440]  a lot of sheriffs are saying
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:58.440]  we're not going to do this
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:00.440]  this is an unconstitutional market to take guns
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:02.440]  from somebody that hadn't done anything wrong
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:04.440]  and we're joined by two great patriots
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:06.440]  Sheriff Bob Songer
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:08.440]  in
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:10.440]  these Native American names I mess them up
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:12.440]  Clickit Top County
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:14.440]  I hope I'm saying that right
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:16.440]  he can correct me if I'm wrong
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:18.440]  and of course we're joined by Joey Gibson
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:20.440]  who needs no introduction
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:22.440]  he runs the National Prayer Group
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:24.440]  who just goes out
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:26.440]  and peacefully stands up to Antifa
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:28.440]  Joey Gibson is the founder of the Patriot Prayer Group
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:30.440]  and of course Gibson for
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:32.440]  Freedom.com
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:34.440]  so you're the expert on this Joey
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:36.440]  along with the sheriff
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:38.440]  on your particular area but remember
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:40.440]  this isn't just Washington State
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:42.440]  this is Blumberg, this is Soros
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:44.440]  this is their plan we can't get national gun bans
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:46.440]  which the New York Times said time to repeal the Second Amendment
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:48.440]  take all semi-autos
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:50.440]  this is the target so
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:52.440]  Washington's fight is your fight
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:54.440]  I know the listeners get that but this is a microcosm
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.440]  of people fighting back
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:58.440]  politically I know Joey goes to these
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:00.440]  events in small towns there's a
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:02.440]  500 people bigger towns a thousand
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:04.440]  and this has got people galvanized
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:06.440]  so Joey why don't you conduct this segment
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:08.440]  the next with the sheriff and I'll
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:10.440]  chime in but you're the expert and thanks for joining us
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.440]  and thanks for joining us sheriff
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:14.440]  thank you
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:16.440]  yeah it's really good to be here
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:18.440]  it's cool that Sheriff Bob Songer is willing
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:20.440]  to come on here and
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:22.440]  yeah just pronounce click attack
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:24.440]  some of these counties are very difficult
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.440]  you know but
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:28.440]  it's good to have a sheriff who's willing to come out
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:30.440]  out in the open and to say
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:32.440]  stand up for what he believes in because there's a lot
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.440]  of sheriffs who believe the same thing
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:36.440]  that Sheriff Bob believes in
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:38.440]  but they're too afraid to speak up and so this is
[01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:40.440]  what we need we need people like Sheriff Bob Songer
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:42.440]  who's willing to come out in the open and
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:44.440]  he's willing to risk everything for the people
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:46.440]  of the Constitution
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:48.440]  I met with him the other day and
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:50.440]  on numerous occasions he specifically told me
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:52.440]  that he works for the people
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:54.440]  okay he's not a politician he doesn't work for himself
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:56.440]  he's voted in by the people and so he will
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:58.440]  protect the people
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:00.440]  well I don't want to gush here but
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:02.440]  sheriffs all over the country particularly in the west
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:04.440]  that have stood up to
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:06.440]  gun confiscation stood up to all sorts of evil
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:08.440]  these are the real heroes that's why you see
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:10.440]  the globalist saying get rid of the American
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:12.440]  sheriff so I mean I should point that
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.440]  out up front I know these guys are usually
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.440]  pretty
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:18.440]  shy not boastful
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:20.440]  but I mean Sheriff you are a hero you've been demonized
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:22.440]  you've been attacked because you're saying you're
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:24.440]  not going to follow unconstitutional orders
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.440]  we think of that as just something that's
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:28.440]  normal but in a
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:30.440]  world of universal deceit telling the truth the
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:32.440]  revolutionary act so explain to people what's happening
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:34.440]  and what you've said
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.440]  well you're spot on
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:38.440]  by the way and so is joy
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:40.440]  the problem I have
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.440]  like 1639
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:44.440]  it violates the U.S. Constitution
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:46.440]  and the Washington State Constitution
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:48.440]  as far as that goes
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:50.440]  and the problem with that
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:52.440]  it's so confusing
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:54.440]  for the average person
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:56.440]  even for law enforcement
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:58.440]  well I was going to be enforced
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:00.440]  I can tell you that I plan on
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:02.440]  not enforcing 1639
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:04.440]  period
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:06.440]  the concern I have not only a violation
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.440]  of second amendment the fourth amendment
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.440]  lack of due process
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:12.440]  and they're going after the HIPAA law
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:14.440]  where they can actually get your medical records
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:16.440]  and
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.440]  they don't say who but somebody
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:20.440]  determines whether you can even possess a firearm
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:22.440]  then
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:24.440]  in addition to that if you don't
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:26.440]  there's a part in that law I understand that
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.440]  if you don't have your weapons
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:30.440]  secured in a safe or something like that
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:32.440]  in your home ammunition in a separate area
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:34.440]  and
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.440]  you could be in violation
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:38.440]  if somebody breaks in
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:40.440]  steals your guns
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:42.440]  breaks a safe open
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.440]  or if you got them in a closet or wherever you might have them
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:46.440]  take your gun goes out to miss a crime
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.440]  they're going to hold the
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:50.440]  homeowner the gun owner
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:52.440]  criminally responsible
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.440]  and that's a bunch of BS
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:56.440]  that's like if somebody steals your car
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:58.440]  and kills somebody you're at fault
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:00.440]  yeah yeah exactly
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:02.440]  I mean it's no
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:04.440]  there's no common sense to any of this
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:06.440]  in the bottom line if the far left
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.440]  was honest with everybody
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:10.440]  they want all your guns
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:12.440]  but they know that might be impossible
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:14.440]  so what they'll do
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:16.440]  they'll chip away at that second amendment
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:18.440]  and go after your guns
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:20.440]  in fact our Attorney General
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:22.440]  in the 2019 legislative session
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:24.440]  right now is going after
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:26.440]  all assault weapons
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:28.440]  if it's got a handle
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:30.440]  detachable clip
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:32.440]  various other features
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:34.440]  you know collapse
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:36.440]  stock those kind of things
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:38.440]  and so if you say
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:40.440]  if you have a similar automatic weapon
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:42.440]  it's got a detachable clip
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:44.440]  that's an assault weapon as far as they're concerned
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.440]  and again if you just
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:48.440]  tuned in listeners this is the formula
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:50.440]  10 years ago Bloomberg and Soros said they do
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:52.440]  and they've spent over
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:54.440]  100 million a year between the two of them
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:56.440]  they also get US State Department money
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:58.440]  and bring it back into the US illegally
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:00.440]  and Lou Dobbs have been talking about that
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:02.440]  so they're running people for local office
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:04.440]  and they're using gun control
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.440]  as a way to get their people in
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:08.440]  once they do that they run a bunch of other scams
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:10.440]  and do these scam bond offerings that Soros gets money from
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:12.440]  basically it's a mafia
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:14.440]  coming to your town taking your gun
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:16.440]  trying to take your gun
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:18.440]  and scamming you
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:20.440]  I mean it's just incredible racketeering in my view Joey
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:22.440]  yeah absolutely
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:24.440]  and obviously these people
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:26.440]  with the billions of dollars they're advocating
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:28.440]  to take away the guns from the normal American people
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:30.440]  they're going to have tons of armed security
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:32.440]  okay this isn't about
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:34.440]  gun control I mean this isn't about
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:36.440]  guns in itself it's really
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.440]  about taking away our freedoms and our rights
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:40.440]  one thing that has been blown my mind
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:42.440]  is that look at what's going on in China
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:44.440]  right now there's a huge crackdown
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:46.440]  on the Christians and even the Muslims too
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:48.440]  and they would never be able to get away
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:50.440]  with that if the people were actually armed
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:52.440]  but the crazy thing is we have these
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:54.440]  these Chinese Christians
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:56.440]  who are willing to sacrifice everything
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:58.440]  to go to prison they're willing to
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:00.440]  even be executed
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:02.440]  in order to continue to preach the word of God
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:04.440]  what I want to know is where's that courage
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:06.440]  where's that in our country
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:08.440]  that's what we need we need people
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:10.440]  who are willing to stand up regardless
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.440]  of what the consequences are and to stand up for freedom
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:14.440]  so that our children will be free
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:16.440]  our grandchildren
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:18.440]  where did the fire of God go
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:20.440]  in America it's still there but how do we get
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:22.440]  to the point where we're not willing to stand up
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:24.440]  when we believe in when we've got a real chance of winning
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:26.440]  when people that are
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:28.440]  have almost no chance of winning do it
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:30.440]  because they know it's about the decision they make
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:32.440]  now I want to talk to Sheriff Bob Songer
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:34.440]  who's an amazing patriot out in Washington State
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.440]  who's refusing
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:38.440]  to take you to jail if somebody breaks
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.440]  in your house and steals your gun
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:42.440]  of course

[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:46.440]  because the American Psychological Association
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:48.440]  magically just says you're mentally ill
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:50.440]  without a real court ruling

[01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:48.440]  one of many sheriffs, one of the few that will go on air
[01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:50.440]  saying I'm not going to enforce these
[01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:52.440]  Soros, Bloomberg publicly funded laws
[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:54.440]  in places like Washington state
[01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:56.440]  but it's Connecticut, New York
[01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:58.440]  it's happening in California
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:00.440]  at least 10 states I know of
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:02.440]  are just running around passing the exact same laws
[01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:04.440]  to in due process just take your guns
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:06.440]  so when he breaks in gets your guns
[01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:08.440]  it's all your fault breaking your cards

[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:14.440]  but it's criminalizing ownership
[01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:16.440]  is what it is
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:18.440]  it's going to let these blue cities persecute people
[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.440]  hate to even say blue cities
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:22.440]  sounds like the cops are bad blue democrat cities
[01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:24.440]  Trump says emergence
[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:26.440]  but here's the huge announcement after they leave me
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:28.440]  I told you my Pentagon sources
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:30.440]  and others said Trump's declaring the emergency
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:32.440]  to circumvent Obama's executive orders
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:34.440]  and they thought he was going to do it last night
[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:36.440]  Pence signaled that
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:38.440]  I'm almost never wrong
[01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:40.440]  I said okay
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:42.440]  zero hedge is right
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:44.440]  he didn't declare it last night
[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:46.440]  the video is coming up
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:48.440]  we're downloading right now
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:50.440]  set to hell
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:52.440]  Trump says emergency declaration
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.440]  coming without border deal
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:56.440]  with the Dems
[01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:58.440]  President Trump said just now
[01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:00.440]  he may declare a national emergency
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:02.440]  to circumvent congress and build a border wall
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:04.440]  if spending talks fail
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:06.440]  he's raising mistakes for negotiations
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:08.440]  set to resume later in the day
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:10.440]  so he got told not to do it last night
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:12.440]  and the speech to hurt the stock market
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:14.440]  I don't think it would
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:16.440]  they can take an action and show he's in charge
[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:18.440]  would help
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:20.440]  but now he's saying
[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:22.440]  and he goes on to say
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:24.440]  but even if that doesn't happen
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:26.440]  I'm going to declare one because of the economy
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:28.440]  the president said he has the absolute right
[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:30.440]  to declare an emergency
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:32.440]  even though legal scholars and democrat lawmakers
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:34.440]  Trump added that these thresholds for declaring
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:36.440]  a national emergency is
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:38.440]  if he cannot reach a deal with congressional democrats
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:40.440]  who have rejected his demand for 5.7 million
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:42.440]  so the comments come
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:44.440]  one day after he argued the nation
[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:46.440]  let's get back to both our guests
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:48.440]  appreciate you both for this segment and the next

[01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:56.440]  are going to be willing to do this
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:58.440]  or what are other sheriffs
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:00.440]  telling you they're planning to do
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:02.440]  well the sheriff's
[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:04.440]  association itself
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:06.440]  voted against I-16
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:08.440]  39
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:10.440]  originally and
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:12.440]  of course I can't speak for individual sheriffs
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:14.440]  they have to make up their own mind
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:16.440]  obviously
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:18.440]  there's a lot of good sheriffs out there
[01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:20.440]  and I'm sure they feel the way I do
[01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:22.440]  but it's up to them how they approach this
[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:24.440]  my feeling on this
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:26.440]  we all took an oath
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:28.440]  under the poll
[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:30.440]  US Constitution
[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:32.440]  and Washington State Constitution
[01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:34.440]  which gives the right to people to bear arms
[01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:36.440]  and
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:38.440]  I-1639 as I stated before
[01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:40.440]  violates that right
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:42.440]  you know there's something we don't want to forget
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:44.440]  God guns and guts
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:46.440]  is what made America free
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:48.440]  and
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:50.440]  we're losing that
[01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:52.440]  basically
[01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:54.440]  they chip away at that second amendment
[01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:56.440]  and make it so difficult
[01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:58.440]  for an honest citizen
[01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:00.440]  to possess a firearm to protect his family
[01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:02.440]  and himself
[01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:04.440]  that pretty soon what they hope
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:06.440]  citizens will just give up the fight
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:08.440]  and not arm themselves
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:10.440]  and
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:12.440]  I for one have told citizens
[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:14.440]  they've called in and asked my position on it
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:16.440]  I said if they come to take your guns
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:18.440]  I'll be standing beside you
[01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:20.440]  and I'll call in a bunch of people
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:22.440]  and depotize them
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:24.440]  they are not going to take your guns
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:26.440]  without due process
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:28.440]  I tell you
[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:30.440]  everywhere else they've taken the guns
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:32.440]  Mexico has total gun control
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:34.440]  they have the highest crime rate in the world
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:36.440]  can't the left and the globalists just
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:38.440]  leave us alone no
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:40.440]  they want the prosperity and the money and the power
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:42.440]  that all this freedom brought
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:44.440]  and then why would they want to extinct the thing
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:46.440]  that gave them a country
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:48.440]  to come to to have so much success Sheriff
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:50.440]  you know
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:52.440]  I think the open border issue
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:54.440]  they're hoping that will increase their
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:56.440]  voting base
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:58.440]  there's a number of reasons I think they do what they do
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:00.440]  unfortunately
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:02.440]  you know
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:04.440]  it's going to be on the back
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:06.440]  of good citizens that
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:08.440]  we're paying the price
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:10.440]  and you know I was told by somebody
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:12.440]  I don't know how true it is
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:14.440]  but there's an individual
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:16.440]  some years ago
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:18.440]  I think it was over in Poland or one of the
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:20.440]  foreign countries over there
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:22.440]  to make a safer community
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:24.440]  they confiscated all weapons
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:26.440]  and
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:28.440]  then he was able to load thousands of people
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:30.440]  on box cars
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:32.440]  had no way to resist
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:34.440]  and his name was
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:36.440]  Adolf Hitler
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:38.440]  and of course we know about the Warsaw ghetto
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:40.440]  we know that did indeed happen
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:42.440]  yeah exactly
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:44.440]  and history can repeat itself
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:46.440]  and they headed towards socialism
[01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:48.440]  and all this nonsense
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:50.440]  Christian marches all over the country
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:52.440]  my reporters tried to go cover an event
[01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:54.440]  and if I had semi-autos
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:56.440]  and threatened to basically kill my reporters
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:58.440]  and the police did nothing in Austin
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:00.440]  because they're blue city police
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:02.440]  and I mean
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:04.440]  people say that it's like this is happening to us
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:06.440]  and the left says
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:08.440]  once we get your guns we're going to kill you
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:10.440]  conservatives and you Christians and they've done it
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:12.440]  everywhere they mean business
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:14.440]  Joey I tell you I wish we had
[01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:16.440]  sheriffs like this guy everywhere
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:18.440]  yeah and the truth is we do have them out there
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:20.440]  they're just
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:22.440]  more concerned about the consequences
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:24.440]  like I was saying earlier
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:26.440]  I think you know Sheriff Bob Songer
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:28.440]  is a really big deal for us right now
[01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:30.440]  because he's a voice for the rest of the sheriffs
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:32.440]  he's there to say
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:34.440]  what all the sheriffs are thinking
[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:36.440]  but maybe they're too afraid to say
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:38.440]  and so I think that we all need to be thinking
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:40.440]  Sheriff Bob Songer
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:42.440]  if you want to click attack county
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:44.440]  you guys definitely elected the right sheriff
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:46.440]  like this is the type of sheriff I wish I had
[01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:48.440]  in Clark County
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:50.440]  my sheriff in Clark County
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:52.440]  without hesitation said yep on 416 39
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:54.440]  never even question it
[01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:56.440]  never even really talked about some of the things
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:58.440]  that are unconstitutional
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:00.440]  it's unbelievable that they're literally going to have people
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:02.440]  in back rooms going through your medical records
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:04.440]  right and just decide
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:06.440]  who's eligible and who isn't
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:08.440]  again no judge no jury
[01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:10.440]  it's a new super class these psychologists
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:12.440]  are almost all leftist
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:14.440]  the American Psychological Association
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:16.440]  just announced Fox has covered it
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.440]  and said men in traditional roles
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:20.440]  period is a mental illness
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:22.440]  I mean
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:24.440]  these people this is a cult
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.440]  of lunatics
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:28.440]  yeah absolutely
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:30.440]  and I do really like another thing too
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:32.440]  that Sheriff Bob Songer did because this is the things
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:34.440]  they don't want men to be men right
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:36.440]  but Sheriff Bob Songer he got 130 citizens
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:38.440]  you know
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:40.440]  not paid volunteer doesn't cost any tax
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:42.440]  he has 130 armed citizens
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:44.440]  ready to act at any moment
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:46.440]  especially in a county a rural county
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:48.440]  he's really reenacting the original
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:50.440]  a posse he's
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:52.440]  he's enacting the real power of the sheriff
[01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:56.440]  absolutely so Sheriff Bob Songer
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:58.440]  you should tell me about that
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:00.440]  you're bringing back local civil defense
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:02.440]  the constitution that's awesome
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:04.440]  well what we have is
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:06.440]  let me say first though
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:08.440]  I'm not speaking for the
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:10.440]  sheriff's association
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:12.440]  oh I know you weren't when I asked

[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:16.440]  we're not saying you speak for the sheriff's
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:18.440]  we were asking what other sheriff's privately
[01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:20.440]  are telling you the sense of things
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:22.440]  right right and that's what
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:24.440]  they're telling me of course
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:26.440]  sure yeah we know you're not speaking for them
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:28.440]  we gotta go to break Joey

[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:50.440]  a lot of key points

[01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:52.440]  creativity
[01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:54.440]  and the dynamic human spirit
[01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:56.440]  that refuses to submit
[01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:00.440]  our grandparents and great grandparents
[01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:02.440]  knew that they can't food
[01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:04.440]  during the fall so they'd have it during the winter
[01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:06.440]  and that's what I'm talking about
[01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:08.440]  at m4store.com

[01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:18.440]  I'm able to go
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:20.440]  with the cost on contracts
[01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:22.440]  that all their other distributors aren't able to do
[01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:24.440]  but I want to be a market leader
[01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:26.440]  and I want you to have storeable food

[01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:38.440]  Hitler took the guns
[01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:40.440]  Stalin took the guns

[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:46.440]  Hugo Chavez took the guns
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:48.440]  and I'm here to tell you
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:50.440]  if you try to take our firearms
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:52.440]  it doesn't matter how many linings you get out there on the street
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:54.440]  begging for them to have their guns taken
[01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:56.440]  we will not relinquish them
[01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:58.440]  do you understand?
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:00.440]  that's why you're going to fail and the establishment knows
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:02.440]  no matter how much propaganda
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:04.440]  the republic will rise again
[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:06.440]  when you attempt to take our guns
[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:08.440]  and they had just had a piece
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:10.440]  before I came on about in India
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:12.440]  mass raping women
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:14.440]  with iron rods
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:16.440]  that's why I said
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:18.440]  Piers you just came out of break
[01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:20.440]  with the last news package about
[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:22.440]  this practice of I guess
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:24.440]  they almost sterilize women with a rod
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:26.440]  it's horrible God
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:28.440]  those guys need to be executed
[01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:30.440]  and it's not the iron rods fault
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:32.440]  it's not the guns fault
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:34.440]  it's not the cars fault
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:36.440]  when Islamist runs over people
[01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:38.440]  so Sheriff Bob Songer
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:40.440]  was out in Kinnokat County
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:42.440]  and Seattle
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:44.440]  and all these other big cities
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:46.440]  they want the guns confiscated
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:48.440]  just if some back room
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:50.440]  get into this sheriff because it's in the law
[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:52.440]  I remember reading this myself before they passed it
[01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:54.440]  and then of course
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:56.440]  Joey Jump in here
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:58.440]  who's been helping expose all this
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:00.440]  Joey Gibson the national prayer group
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:02.440]  just about how dangerous this is
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:04.440]  not even from a second amendment perspective
[01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:06.440]  but also want to get into your posse
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:08.440]  and you're trying to make another point about not speaking
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:10.440]  for the sheriff's association
[01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:12.440]  basically in the 10 minutes we've got
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:14.440]  to have the viewers
[01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:16.440]  well I appreciate the opportunity
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:18.440]  Alex and Joey for
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:20.440]  getting a chance to
[01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:22.440]  be on and address
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:24.440]  1639
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:26.440]  let me first touch on the posse
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:28.440]  it's a citizen organization
[01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:30.440]  volunteer and of course
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:32.440]  we do backgrounds and folks to join the posse
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:34.440]  because I am a big second amendment guy
[01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:36.440]  then they're
[01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:38.440]  they're allowed to carry a firearm
[01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:40.440]  when they're in uniform
[01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:42.440]  well they can carry it off duty anytime they want
[01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:44.440]  but
[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:46.440]  while they're in uniform they can carry a firearm
[01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:48.440]  after they've qualified
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:50.440]  through the NRA qualification course
[01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:52.440]  and
[01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:54.440]  but we use the posse members
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:56.440]  for events like
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:58.440]  security at county fair
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:00.440]  rodeos
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:02.440]  assist on traffic control
[01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:04.440]  they have no arrest authority
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:06.440]  unless an
[01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:08.440]  an outstanding emergency was to come up
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:10.440]  then I could
[01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:12.440]  increase their authority at that point
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:14.440]  and let me guess, I mean I was reading
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:16.440]  that it's been a success since you did it
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:18.440]  and it saves the county a lot of money
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:20.440]  absolutely and by the way
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:22.440]  we have six private pilots that
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:24.440]  fly for us at no cost
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:26.440]  not even for fuel
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:28.440]  they donate all of that
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:30.440]  they fly of course during fire season
[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:32.440]  they look for fires
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:34.440]  if we have a suspect...
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:36.440]  but that's the way it's always been in any free society
[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:38.440]  particularly
[01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:40.440]  they have their regular job
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:42.440]  but then when there's an emergency
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:44.440]  they work with the local tabulary
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:46.440]  and that's the power of the society
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:48.440]  absolutely
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:50.440]  they're a partner with our law enforcement agency
[01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:52.440]  to make a safer community
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:54.440]  and I'm extremely proud of those individuals
[01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:56.440]  we have reserve deputies
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:58.440]  and certain rescue volunteers as well
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:00.440]  but the posse itself
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:02.440]  over about a
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:04.440]  10-11 month period
[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:06.440]  the hours that they put in
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:08.440]  calculated out at a
[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:10.440]  minimum wage
[01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:12.440]  around $269,000
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:14.440]  they saved the county
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:16.440]  in services
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:18.440]  but it's about getting everybody involved
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:20.440]  it's just the American way
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:22.440]  it's the Western way
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:24.440]  getting back to this gun confiscation
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:26.440]  what do you expect to happen
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:28.440]  we've already seen other areas of the country
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:30.440]  where somebody in a secret liberal
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:32.440]  back room says this guy is PTSD
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:34.440]  he doesn't have a criminal record
[01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:36.440]  he didn't threaten anybody but let's just take his guns
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:38.440]  and then
[01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:40.440]  it will not happen on my watch
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:42.440]  I will stand there
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:44.440]  with that individual citizen
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:46.440]  and prevent that from happening
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:48.440]  and if need be
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:50.440]  it could get ugly
[01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:52.440]  I mean we really are
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:54.440]  we don't want violence
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:56.440]  but we're not starting anything sheriff in in Joey
[01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:58.440]  but we kind of have that Bunker Hill moment coming
[01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:00.440]  when you've got the left
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:02.440]  in cities they control
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:04.440]  and the police help anti-foot attack people
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:06.440]  they stand down
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:08.440]  and now they're coming for our guns
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:10.440]  and now they've got the pedophile groups in the school
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:12.440]  sexualizing the children
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:14.440]  and at a certain point
[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:16.440]  I'm afraid that Bunker Hill moment
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:18.440]  where they come from the guns
[01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:20.440]  is going to have that shot heard around the world Joey
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:22.440]  unfortunately
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:24.440]  that's true
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:26.440]  it's something we definitely want to avoid
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:28.440]  and I know you talked about that all the time Alex
[01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:30.440]  it's not going to work to our advantage
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:32.440]  we're talking about a lot of people dying
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:34.440]  and it's probably going to get more power to the government
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:36.440]  but unfortunately it's like how much can you push
[01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:38.440]  how much can you push and poke before people
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:40.440]  come back
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:42.440]  and the interesting thing to me is you have
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:44.440]  different situations where they've tried to go in
[01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:46.440]  and take guns and they see how the public reacts
[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:48.440]  one example in Seattle
[01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:50.440]  I believe last year
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:52.440]  they went in, the police broke down a guy's door
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:54.440]  took all his guns because
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:56.440]  the guy's neighbors felt uncomfortable
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:58.440]  he was open caring all the time
[01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:00.440]  which in Seattle you can open carry anywhere
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:02.440]  except for private property
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:04.440]  I've seen articles where a guy
[01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:06.440]  the city grows out to his area
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:08.440]  was a case in Texas and the guy's skinning a deer
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:10.440]  in the countryside and the neighbors call the police
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:12.440]  and they take him to jail
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:14.440]  calling 10 guns an arsenal because it upset
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:16.440]  the Californians that the guy was
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:18.440]  gutting a deer and these people are crazy
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:20.440]  absolutely true
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:22.440]  now think about this
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:24.440]  here's what's really interesting
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:26.440]  there's a lot of firearms on your show
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:28.440]  in Bonner County in Idaho
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:30.440]  you remember when the VA was going around
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:32.440]  taking all the guns from the veterans
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:34.440]  now what happened, the sheriff stood
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:36.440]  in front of the guy's house
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:38.440]  with over 100 citizens
[01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:40.440]  and even Matt Shea
[01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:42.440]  who's from Washington state
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:44.440]  a state representative
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:46.440]  they stood out there and said you're not going to come in
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:48.440]  and violate the constitution
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:50.440]  and take this man's firearms
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:52.440]  and look at the difference in the response
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:54.440]  in that county, they know that county will stand up
[01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:56.440]  what happened in Seattle
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:58.440]  nothing, no outrage, nothing
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:00.440]  but let's be clear, people like Sheriff Sanger
[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:02.440]  and the other sheriff
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:04.440]  people have to support them, pray for them
[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:06.440]  he's going to get the demon eyes coming on here
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:08.440]  they'll make a bunch of lies
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:10.440]  Soros and Bloomberg are openly
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:12.440]  financing trying to stop
[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:14.440]  in fact, Sheriff Sanger
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:16.440]  I haven't followed your particular case but
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:18.440]  I'm sure you're aware of the millions
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:20.440]  that those guys are spending in Washington state alone
[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:22.440]  it's like you've got even more courage
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:24.440]  sticking your head up because obviously
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:26.440]  they're going to target you now in your reelection
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:28.440]  yeah, well
[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:30.440]  I just went through a reelection and got re-elected
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:32.440]  good
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:34.440]  so folks like what you're doing
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:36.440]  yes
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:38.440]  and I am awful proud and humbled
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:40.440]  that I get to serve another four years
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:42.440]  for the citizens
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:44.440]  and really that's what it's about
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:46.440]  you know, elected sheriffs
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:48.440]  they're only boss
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:50.440]  is the citizens
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:52.440]  and it's not some
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:54.440]  board or council or anything like this
[01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:56.440]  and I can tell you
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:58.440]  I've served four years as a police chief
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:00.440]  in Elko, Nevada
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:02.440]  and I can tell you that police chiefs
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:04.440]  feel just like I do
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:06.440]  but unfortunately they don't have the ability
[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:08.440]  that a sheriff has because the sheriff's elected
[01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:10.440]  they speak out
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:12.440]  and their boss, council
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:14.440]  or mayor happens to be
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:16.440]  liberal
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:18.440]  they'd better be looking for a new job
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:20.440]  sure, so municipalities are muzzled
[01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:22.440]  and that's why the office of the president going back 800 years
[01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:24.440]  is so sacrosanct
[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:26.440]  yep
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:28.440]  what do you think sheriff of the attempts by the globalists on the left
[01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:30.440]  to remove and
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:32.440]  immunize the sheriff and merge it under cities
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:34.440]  that's asked backwards
[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:36.440]  yeah, well that's what they'd like to do
[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:38.440]  and you see some of these
[01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:40.440]  home rule counties
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:42.440]  where the sheriff's position
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:44.440]  is actually appointed
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:46.440]  you're getting right back to a police chief's
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:48.440]  situation
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:50.440]  they need to keep those
[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:52.440]  sheriff's elected positions
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.440]  because the people then
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:56.440]  have say so
[01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:58.440]  well sure, it's another check and balance
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:00.440]  of the jury, the grand jury, the people elect
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:02.440]  their law enforcement
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:04.440]  wow, what a British
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:06.440]  and Americana idea
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:08.440]  gentlemen, I want to salute you both
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:10.440]  I want to thank you
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:12.440]  Joey, the great work you're doing
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:14.440]  please come back on
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:16.440]  to advise us on what's unfolding in your area
[01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:18.440]  you're the front line of the defense
[01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:20.440]  not just your constituents but also the country
[01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:22.440]  is there any way for people to
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:24.440]  contact you Bob if they want to try to support you
[01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:26.440]  or interview you
[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:28.440]  or just go to the website for the county
[01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:30.440]  they're in Washington
[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:32.440]  they can do that
[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:34.440]  or they can reach me on my cell phone
[01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:36.440]  it's 509-261-1833
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:40.440]  okay, you're about to get 5,000 calls
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:42.440]  but some of them will be mean
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:44.440]  this guy's John Wayne for real
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:46.440]  all right gentlemen, we love you
[01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:48.440]  we appreciate you and I'll meet you right there
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:50.440]  at the Alamo, God bless
[01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:52.440]  thank you
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:54.440]  there's another still some Americans left
[01:42:54.440 --> 01:43:14.440]  and we're going to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom
[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:18.440]  our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper
[01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:20.440]  it consists of the things that we're willing to fight for
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:22.440]  the First Amendment, the Bill of Rights
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:24.440]  we don't understand that because they're taking them right now
[01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:30.440]  we have seen what they want to do
[01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:32.440]  they called it UN Agenda 21
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:34.440]  now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda
[01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:36.440]  they want everybody off of the rural lands
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:38.440]  they want people out of the suburbs
[01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:40.440]  they want to pack everybody into the cities
[01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:42.440]  because that's where it is easiest
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:44.440]  for them to control everyone
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:46.440]  it's The David Knight Show
[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:48.440]  I never missed your show
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:50.440]  any day
[01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:52.440]  every week
[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:54.440]  I mean never
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:56.440]  editforce.com
[01:43:56.440 --> 01:43:58.440]  forward slash show
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:00.440]  the globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen
[01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:02.440]  and pump the environment full of the bad halogens
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:04.440]  fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:06.440]  that it lowers IQ
[01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:08.440]  it literally dumps the population down
[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:10.440]  and on our quest to bring
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:12.440]  our listeners and viewers
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:14.440]  the best iodine in the world
[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:16.440]  we've gone through two permutations
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:18.440]  first seaweed based iodine
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:20.440]  very good but hard to source
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:22.440]  and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:24.440]  so we discovered deep earth crystals
[01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:26.440]  a pure nascent iodine
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:28.440]  and brought you X2 that's been incredible
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:30.440]  now, due to the establishment trying to block that
[01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:32.440]  we did more research
[01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:34.440]  and secured more of the deep earth crystals
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:36.440]  of nascent iodine
[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:38.440]  but chemists, scientists and others
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:40.440]  showed us the research that by combining it
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:42.440]  with three other compounds
[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:44.440]  two forms of iodine and vitamin C
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:46.440]  it supercharges it
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:48.440]  even more bioavailable
[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:50.440]  ladies and gentlemen
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:52.440]  you want to research it, you want to see it
[01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:54.440]  it's an incredible discovery

[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:44.440]  I'll be back three weeks or so
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:46.440]  had a heart attack, it was getting better
[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:48.440]  we got great posts
[01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:50.440]  I was in a selection of people
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:52.440]  like Harrison Smith
[01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:54.440]  Paul Watson's gonna be on tomorrow
[01:47:56.440 --> 01:47:58.440]  that's Friday he's gonna be co-hosting
[01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:00.440]  he's on this show tomorrow
[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:02.440]  alright
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:04.440]  I feel like I should open the phones up for callers
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:06.440]  to talk about
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:08.440]  Trump's speech last night
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:10.440]  and the fact that he said I may declare a national emergency
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:12.440]  I'm going to declare a national emergency
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:14.440]  the word was he was gonna do it
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:18.440]  now there's reports where he's back out saying it
[01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:20.440]  so I don't know what's going on behind the scenes
[01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:22.440]  but
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:24.440]  that's in the Constitution
[01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:26.440]  and it's also
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:28.440]  a fact that Obama put in executive orders
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:30.440]  that I think are unconstitutional
[01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:32.440]  that can only be overridden by a new emergency
[01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:34.440]  and that's how Obama
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:36.440]  created a government within a government
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:38.440]  of his operatives staying behind in the system
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:42.440]  to block the president
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:44.440]  so
[01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:46.440]  the most disquieting thing is that
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:52.440]  Trump says get the troops out of
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:54.440]  Syria
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:56.440]  cut them in half in Afghanistan
[01:48:56.440 --> 01:48:58.440]  and we just hear
[01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:00.440]  well that's not happening
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:04.440]  all these people are resigning
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:06.440]  how dare you destabilize things when it's Obama
[01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:08.440]  started the Syria war
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:10.440]  funded the Arab Spring
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:12.440]  what?
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:14.440]  he was going to let ISIS come in
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:16.440]  and Al Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:18.440]  and all of that and the big columns of trucks
[01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:20.440]  driving in
[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:22.440]  and that media just ignored it
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:24.440]  and then now it's
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:26.440]  Trump's fault
[01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:28.440]  that we had to deal with Syria once they were defeated
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:30.440]  to pull out
[01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:32.440]  and then I see Trump
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:34.440]  being countermanded by all this
[01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:36.440]  and it's because of bureaucracy
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:40.440]  is it war with this country?
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:42.440]  you know, there's a name for that
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:44.440]  biologically
[01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:46.440]  it's called cancer
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:48.440]  that's right
[01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:50.440]  it's called cancer when your own
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:52.440]  tissues
[01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:54.440]  start doing what they want
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:56.440]  could be your liver, could be your skin, could be your lungs
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:49:58.440]  could be your blood
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:00.440]  and it just goes, hey wire it starts doing whatever it wants
[01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:04.440]  and I look at the talking points
[01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:06.440]  put out by the Democrats on every issue
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:08.440]  I've got three or four clips the last day
[01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:10.440]  there is no
[01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:12.440]  human smuggling on the border
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:14.440]  there is no crisis
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:16.440]  we've got like ten clips of that
[01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:18.440]  you've all heard it, no reason to play it
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:20.440]  it's everywhere
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:22.440]  then I saw one of these Democrat congressmen
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:24.440]  I'm probably pronouncing his name
[01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:26.440]  it was like Klingon
[01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:28.440]  just during the break I was just
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:30.440]  literally getting
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:32.440]  a cup of coffee in my dredgerport.com
[01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:34.440]  cup
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:36.440]  by the way
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:38.440]  this is my cup for like ten years
[01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:40.440]  so people stop using it and I find other people's offices
[01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:42.440]  I have to go find this
[01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:44.440]  repeatedly in my cup
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:46.440]  leave it alone, it's mine
[01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:48.440]  I'm not an authoritarian around here
[01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:50.440]  but keep your hands off my damn cup
[01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:52.440]  and I'm sitting there watching Fox News
[01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:54.440]  like five minutes ago
[01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:56.440]  we've got all these TVs on and it's like
[01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:58.440]  there's no reality here
[01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:00.440]  nothing's happening on the border
[01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:02.440]  and it's just like where does it end
[01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:04.440]  with these people
[01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:06.440]  what are they doing
[01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:08.440]  I think you're that dumb to act like
[01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:10.440]  you heard Trump say we're a nation god
[01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:12.440]  I can't believe the FCC
[01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:14.440]  let me say that dirty word
[01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:16.440]  yeah, next they'll tell you ducks quack
[01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:18.440]  I know it's crazy
[01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:20.440]  we've got a whole bunch of these clips coming up next hour
[01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:22.440]  we've got a special guest joining us
[01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:24.440]  and I'm going to open the phones up too
[01:51:24.440 --> 01:51:26.440]  but let's play just the latest one
[01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:28.440]  I just hit pause on the TV
[01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:30.440]  and we've got the DVR wired in here
[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:32.440]  here's Fox News like six minutes ago
[01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:34.440]  here it is
[01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:36.440]  I thought that Donald Trump
[01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:38.440]  made a speech that's completely
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:40.440]  inconsistent with reality
[01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:42.440]  it could have been something that we heard at a rally
[01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:44.440]  not something that
[01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:46.440]  we should hear from an oval office presentation
[01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:48.440]  Fox News
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:50.440]  stop right there, so he sits up there trying to sound
[01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:52.440]  credible
[01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:54.440]  with huge waves of people smashing over borders
[01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:56.440]  and death and disease that you
[01:51:56.440 --> 01:51:58.440]  are admitting record TB
[01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:00.440]  all of it pouring across into U.S. school rooms
[01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:02.440]  that's in the news today
[01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:04.440]  and all these attacks going on
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:08.440]  and he says there was no reality
[01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:10.440]  well his clips nothing in fact
[01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:12.440]  I've got all the clips here where
[01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:14.440]  they say there is no child smuggling
[01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:16.440]  there is no human smuggling
[01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:18.440]  there is no caravan
[01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:22.440]  other clips, no one wants your guns
[01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:24.440]  they're everywhere saying
[01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:26.440]  we will get your damn guns
[01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:28.440]  no one wants your guns
[01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:36.440]  but the greatest illustration of this
[01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:40.440]  that I've seen so far
[01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:42.440]  is a story on infowars.com
[01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:44.440]  about
[01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:46.440]  their fact checking Trump's speech
[01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:48.440]  CNN has this thing where they put up
[01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:50.440]  thousands of gun balls and say that's every lie
[01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:52.440]  like look
[01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:54.440]  Pinocchio's nose is growing
[01:52:54.440 --> 01:52:56.440]  and you actually look at what Trump's done
[01:52:56.440 --> 01:52:58.440]  he's backed off on a few promises
[01:52:58.440 --> 01:53:00.440]  gotten done the lines here of what he said he would do
[01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:02.440]  or tried
[01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:04.440]  and then you fact check every fact check
[01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:06.440]  they do
[01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:08.440]  here's an example
[01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:10.440]  Politifact Snopes have articles
[01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:12.440]  saying is it true
[01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:14.440]  the U.N. wants to flood
[01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:16.440]  North America was
[01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:18.440]  600 million quote migrants
[01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:20.440]  by 2050
[01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:22.440]  and you read their
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:24.440]  fact check and it says
[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:26.440]  false, totally false
[01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:28.440]  you read the first few paragraphs
[01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:30.440]  you read the bottom it says it's true
[01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:32.440]  it's a U.N. document
[01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:34.440]  but they don't mean to
[01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:36.440]  implement it
[01:53:40.440 --> 01:53:42.440]  that's what they do
[01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:44.440]  so they had a fact check
[01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:46.440]  Trump has been told to be very conservative by his fact checkers
[01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:48.440]  so they're like
[01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:50.440]  the L.A. says 60-80%
[01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:52.440]  get raped
[01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:54.440]  on their way here
[01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:56.440]  and other numbers show that's
[01:53:56.440 --> 01:53:58.440]  similar just say one in three
[01:53:58.440 --> 01:54:00.440]  so Trump says one in three women
[01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:02.440]  coming up from Latin America get raped
[01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:04.440]  before they get here and this is wrong
[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:06.440]  and it's out of control to have an uncontrolled giant
[01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:08.440]  corridor
[01:54:08.440 --> 01:54:10.440]  I don't like all the extra stuff at airports
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:12.440]  but you should have it at your borders
[01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:14.440]  but we have it at airports
[01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:16.440]  borders
[01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:20.440]  and so there's Trump saying this
[01:54:20.440 --> 01:54:22.440]  and then CBS News
[01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:24.440]  fact checks it and goes
[01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:26.440]  oh he said one in three
[01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:28.440]  he's wrong it's 80%
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:30.440]  I scroll down and show him the screenshots
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:32.440]  they removed
[01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:34.440]  the article
[01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:38.440]  so the fact checker wasn't thinking like oh
[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:40.440]  we've got Trump it's
[01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:42.440]  at least twice as bad as he's saying
[01:54:42.440 --> 01:54:44.440]  80% are getting raped
[01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:46.440]  and they went wait a minute idiot
[01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:48.440]  that makes this point
[01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:50.440]  that's Amos International
[01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:52.440]  and liberal groups saying that pull it down
[01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:54.440]  just like oh
[01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:56.440]  some witness says they saw a white guy
[01:54:56.440 --> 01:54:58.440]  might have been at the scene that a
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:00.440]  little black girl got killed
[01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:02.440]  oh my god there's a white supremacist on the loose
[01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:04.440]  he's gonna kill everybody
[01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:06.440]  turns out the sheriff and others had the tip
[01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:08.440]  of the name and who it turned out to be
[01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:10.440]  who's pled guilty
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:12.440]  and everything and didn't act on it
[01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:14.440]  law enforcement separately
[01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:16.440]  pulled over one of the two
[01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:18.440]  and thought they were acting suspicious and found out more
[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:20.440]  and the guy confessed
[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:22.440]  so you'd still be hearing about little jasmine
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:24.440]  killed by the white devil
[01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:26.440]  and the sheriff would be all over the news
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:28.440]  Sheriff Gonzalez I'm gonna stop
[01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:30.440]  these white supremacists you better believe it
[01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:32.440]  when he's
[01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:34.440]  shadow on his hands
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:36.440]  but thank god other police didn't
[01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:40.440]  that's a group of dirt bags folks
[01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:42.440]  that's a group of dirt bags
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:44.440]  right there
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:46.440]  and it's what they do all
[01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:48.440]  day long
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:50.440]  24-7
[01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:52.440]  maybe that maybe it's just
[01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:54.440]  an accident that he got the exact tip
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:56.440]  and he and the main
[01:55:56.440 --> 01:55:58.440]  black lives matter activist
[01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:00.440]  just kept it to themselves
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:02.440]  because they said that they said
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:04.440]  we think
[01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:06.440]  the idea that two black men
[01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:08.440]  killed this little girl in cold
[01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:10.440]  blood for no reason
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:12.440]  is just what was the exact statement
[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:14.440]  it's in the local news
[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:16.440]  was just too improbable
[01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:20.440]  let me see about
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:22.440]  95% of blacks are killed by blacks
[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:28.440]  but it's improbable
[01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:30.440]  that black people would kill black people
[01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:32.440]  okay
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:34.440]  again
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:38.440]  maybe the sheriff's got a 70 IQ
[01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:42.440]  or he's really evil
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:46.440]  because he learns on Wednesday afternoon
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:48.440]  exactly who did it from a tip
[01:56:48.440 --> 01:56:50.440]  and doesn't report it
[01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:52.440]  and doesn't act on it
[01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:54.440]  and keeps going even
[01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:56.440]  after they'd already busted
[01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:00.440]  the gentleman that ended
[01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:02.440]  scumbags
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:04.440]  that ended up admitting that they did it
[01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:06.440]  they were still tweeting
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:08.440]  favorably to get more twitter followers
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:10.440]  on the big twitter bonanza
[01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:12.440]  the race war bonanza
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:14.440]  just like a slot machine
[01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:20.440]  whites are killing us
[01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:22.440]  whites whites whites
[01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:24.440]  meanwhile
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:26.440]  you don't do a damn thing to stop your kids
[01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:28.440]  actually getting killed
[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:30.440]  makes me sick
[01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:32.440]  I don't care what color you are
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:34.440]  black baby white baby whatever
[01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:36.440]  I care about babies
[01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:38.440]  but I'm sure as hell tired of all these
[01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:40.440]  so-called minorities
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:42.440]  teamed up with the globalists running around
[01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:44.440]  on their racist anti-white crusade
[01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:46.440]  that's going absolutely nowhere
[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:48.440]  but societal collapse
[01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:50.440]  we are kept afloat only by
[01:57:50.440 --> 01:57:52.440]  your loyal patronage
[01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:54.440]  and that's why we need you to go to the site now
[01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:56.440]  if you're not in the market for one of our
[01:57:56.440 --> 01:57:58.440]  latest nutraceuticals
[01:57:58.440 --> 01:58:00.440]  please consider a contribution
[01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:02.440]  25, 50, 100
[01:58:02.440 --> 01:58:04.440]  250 or even $500
[01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:06.440]  would be a godsend
[01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:08.440]  to our important work here
[01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:10.440]  to beat back the globalists
[01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:12.440]  and to destroy their campaign of censorship
[01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:14.440]  in which they want to strangle
[01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:34.440]  their first amendment rights
[01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:46.440]  if you're help downloading it we are unstoppable
[01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:16.440]  you can override the censors now
[01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:18.440]  and if all of our audience gets involved
[01:59:18.440 --> 01:59:20.440]  with hashtag alex jones
[01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:22.440]  we are unstoppable together
[01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:24.440]  we've already changed the world together
[01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:26.440]  with our laser focus
[01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:28.440]  do it again with hashtag alex jones
[01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:30.440]  on twitter, on facebook, on google
[01:59:30.440 --> 01:59:32.440]  on youtube, everywhere
[01:59:32.440 --> 01:59:34.440]  call and talk radio, c-span
[01:59:34.440 --> 01:59:36.440]  shout it out loud and public
[01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:38.440]  hashtag alex jones
[01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:40.440]  that's the rallying cry to restore the first amendment
[01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:42.440]  creativity
[01:59:42.440 --> 01:59:44.440]  and the dynamic human spirit
[01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:46.440]  that refuses to submit
[01:59:46.440 --> 02:00:08.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:26.440]  music
[02:00:26.440 --> 02:00:28.440]  you know
[02:00:28.440 --> 02:00:30.440]  I haven't even gotten into
[02:00:30.440 --> 02:00:32.440]  a lot of the stacks of news I have here in front of me
[02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:36.440]  and when I'm wrong about something
[02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:38.440]  yeah I'm wrong about it
[02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:40.440]  but I was not wrong when I boldly said
[02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:42.440]  Trump set to declare a national emergency
[02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:44.440]  over the border
[02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:46.440]  because they'd been signaling
[02:00:46.440 --> 02:00:48.440]  they were going to do it but what he did was
[02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:50.440]  change course
[02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:52.440]  and that's not a good thing
[02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:54.440]  he's made statements
[02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:56.440]  he still may declare the state of emergency
[02:00:56.440 --> 02:00:58.440]  oh yeah
[02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:00.440]  you may release the FISA warrants
[02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:02.440]  fully showing the illegal
[02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:04.440]  bs that Mueller involved himself in
[02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:06.440]  then do it
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:08.440]  because
[02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:10.440]  our asses
[02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:12.440]  are hanging out here in the breeze
[02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:14.440]  when the globalists breathe them down
[02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:16.440]  our neck
[02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:20.440]  and you know you got to be careful
[02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:22.440]  what you asked for
[02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:26.440]  I told listeners to go in these
[02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:28.440]  so-called gay bars
[02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:30.440]  legally lawfully don't be violent
[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:32.440]  if they choose the citizens
[02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:34.440]  where they have little kids performing
[02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:36.440]  doing drag
[02:01:36.440 --> 02:01:38.440]  and I said it's obviously pedophilic
[02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:40.440]  and did you know people did it
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:42.440]  and got recordings
[02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:44.440]  of people talking about screwing kids
[02:01:44.440 --> 02:01:46.440]  yeah
[02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:48.440]  you know
[02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:50.440]  an entire group of law enforcement
[02:01:50.440 --> 02:01:52.440]  would have to deal with that for a month
[02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:54.440]  decide what was going to happen
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:56.440]  and what was going to go on and who was involved
[02:01:56.440 --> 02:01:58.440]  and everything
[02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:00.440]  and obviously I told the people
[02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:02.440]  I said you need to give that to law enforcement
[02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:08.440]  and I think that's what it comes down to
[02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:10.440]  is I do need like a month long vacation
[02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:12.440]  and I don't feel sorry for myself
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:14.440]  I'm not bitchin' to complain
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:16.440]  I'm like
[02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:18.440]  a police detective that has 50,000 files
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:20.440]  and I feel guilty
[02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:22.440]  that I can't deal with all these damn things
[02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:24.440]  and they're all
[02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:26.440]  out of the park grand slammers
[02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:28.440]  I mean
[02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:30.440]  we are overrun
[02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:32.440]  by devil worshipping pedophiles
[02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:36.440]  I mean you want to know
[02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:38.440]  at the bottom of the barrel
[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:40.440]  the bottom of the damn rabbit hole
[02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:42.440]  what you're going to find
[02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:44.440]  it's kid screwing and kid murdering
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:46.440]  vampires
[02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:48.440]  and
[02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:50.440]  hmm
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:52.440]  I'm just mad at myself
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:54.440]  get it off screen
[02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:56.440]  just get it off
[02:02:56.440 --> 02:02:58.440]  I'm not mad at the crew playing it
[02:02:58.440 --> 02:03:00.440]  normally I'd say
[02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:02.440]  I just can't handle anymore
[02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:04.440]  oh god
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:08.440]  and the fact that
[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:10.440]  we've got to sit here
[02:03:10.440 --> 02:03:12.440]  and beg people to care and beg people
[02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:14.440]  to get involved
[02:03:14.440 --> 02:03:16.440]  and then even when they do get involved
[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:18.440]  which is great
[02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:20.440]  the crap you hear
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:22.440]  from the bar owners
[02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:24.440]  and you're just the sliminess
[02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:26.440]  it's like this isn't like
[02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:28.440]  watching a movie
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:30.440]  or reading about evil
[02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:32.440]  when you know it's there
[02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:34.440]  and you hear it's confidence
[02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:36.440]  hey you know
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:38.440]  it's just going to get worse and worse
[02:03:42.440 --> 02:03:44.440]  because of the selfishness
[02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:50.440]  of the average person
[02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:54.440]  I'm going to tell you something right now
[02:03:56.440 --> 02:03:58.440]  it's good to fight evil
[02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:00.440]  and it's good to go against the globalists
[02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:02.440]  so that people who are
[02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:04.440]  partly awake become fully awake
[02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:06.440]  so they get a relationship with God
[02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:08.440]  and so they recognize evil in their life
[02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:10.440]  so they make that decision
[02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:12.440]  it's all about souls
[02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:14.440]  to save this planet
[02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:16.440]  let me tell you
[02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:18.440]  everything you see
[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:20.440]  in the near future
[02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:22.440]  20 years 30 years
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:24.440]  is going to be burned to a crisp
[02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:26.440]  all these big buildings
[02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:28.440]  all these globalists are going to be dead in the hammer
[02:04:28.440 --> 02:04:30.440]  just like Christ told them
[02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:32.440]  in Jerusalem when the Pharisees were getting ready to haul him up
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:34.440]  and kill him he said
[02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:36.440]  you see these stones of this wall
[02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:38.440]  in your lifetimes
[02:04:38.440 --> 02:04:40.440]  there won't be one stone on top of the other
[02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:42.440]  I'm just telling you
[02:04:42.440 --> 02:04:44.440]  as a political operative
[02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:46.440]  and a researcher that cares about humanity
[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:48.440]  I can tell you right now
[02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:50.440]  these globalists are crazy
[02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:52.440]  and they're going to destroy everything
[02:04:52.440 --> 02:05:12.440]  not before they rape the hell out of your kids
[02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:25.440]  this incredible formula can help your body in many ways
[02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:27.440]  including supporting heart health
[02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:29.440]  joint health and cognitive health
[02:05:29.440 --> 02:05:31.440]  aiding and regulating fat metabolism
[02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:34.440]  helping to maintain cognitive function and more
[02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:36.440]  and while other krill oil formulas
[02:05:36.440 --> 02:05:38.440]  may chemically modify their formulas
[02:05:38.440 --> 02:05:40.440]  we're giving you the benefits of a simple formula
[02:05:40.440 --> 02:05:43.440]  that contains unmodified high quality krill oil concentrate
[02:05:43.440 --> 02:05:45.440]  paired with our ultimate fish oil
[02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:46.440]  or used separately
[02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:48.440]  it's time to see what krill oil can do for you
[02:05:48.440 --> 02:05:50.440]  with ultimate krill oil
[02:05:50.440 --> 02:05:53.440]  now available at infowarstore.com
[02:06:20.440 --> 02:06:22.440]  Donald Trump's address tonight
[02:06:22.440 --> 02:06:24.440]  when we know that Donald Trump
[02:06:24.440 --> 02:06:26.440]  is going to be using it
[02:06:26.440 --> 02:06:27.440]  to spread these lies
[02:06:27.440 --> 02:06:28.440]  because people believe it
[02:06:28.440 --> 02:06:30.440]  the president will say what he has to say
[02:06:30.440 --> 02:06:31.440]  people will believe it
[02:06:31.440 --> 02:06:33.440]  whether the facts are true or not
[02:06:33.440 --> 02:06:34.440]  why should they run
[02:06:34.440 --> 02:06:35.440]  Donald Trump's address tonight
[02:06:35.440 --> 02:06:37.440]  when they know he's going
[02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:39.440]  to be spreading lies and falsehood
[02:06:39.440 --> 02:06:41.440]  the answer to your question Joe is they shouldn't
[02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:43.440]  one of the most time honored
[02:06:43.440 --> 02:06:45.440]  and powerful ways a president has
[02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:47.440]  to communicate with the American people
[02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:49.440]  is through a prime time
[02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:51.440]  the official office address
[02:06:51.440 --> 02:06:52.440]  the majesty of the setting
[02:06:52.440 --> 02:06:54.440]  the request for a valuable television time
[02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:56.440]  the president says he wants airtime
[02:06:56.440 --> 02:06:57.440]  he just gets it right
[02:06:57.440 --> 02:06:59.440]  well the answer is no
[02:06:59.440 --> 02:07:00.440]  President Trump
[02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:02.440]  you will not get your wall
[02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:16.440]  a wall is an immorality
[02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:18.440]  not who we are as a nation
[02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:20.440]  you're considered using emergency power
[02:07:20.440 --> 02:07:22.440]  to grant yourself authorities
[02:07:22.440 --> 02:07:25.440]  to build this wall without congressional approval
[02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:26.440]  yes I am
[02:07:26.440 --> 02:07:27.440]  and I can do it if I want
[02:07:27.440 --> 02:07:29.440]  and so he doesn't need the congress
[02:07:29.440 --> 02:07:31.440]  to appropriate the funds for the wall
[02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:33.440]  you don't need congressional approval to build it
[02:07:33.440 --> 02:07:34.440]  no we can use them
[02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:36.440]  absolutely we can call a national emergency
[02:07:36.440 --> 02:07:38.440]  because of the security of our country
[02:07:38.440 --> 02:07:39.440]  absolutely
[02:07:39.440 --> 02:07:41.440]  it's now up to you
[02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:43.440]  to decide which side you're on
[02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:45.440]  that's where we are
[02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:47.440]  and Trump is moving in the right direction
[02:07:47.440 --> 02:07:49.440]  the only direction he has
[02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:51.440]  is to use his constitutional executive power
[02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:53.440]  as traders in the government
[02:07:53.440 --> 02:07:55.440]  to declare a national emergency
[02:07:55.440 --> 02:07:57.440]  and take matters into his own hands
[02:07:57.440 --> 02:07:59.440]  our destries are now bound forever
[02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:01.440]  we ask you to now take action
[02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:03.440]  and declare the national emergency
[02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:05.440]  and clear the scourge
[02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:07.440]  of the foreign globalist infestation
[02:08:07.440 --> 02:08:09.440]  threatening America and the world
[02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:12.440]  waging war on corruption
[02:08:12.440 --> 02:08:14.440]  it's Alex Jones
[02:08:14.440 --> 02:08:15.440]  coming to you live
[02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:18.440]  on the front lines of the Info War
[02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:18.440]  for the unknown soldier
[02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:33.440]  all right, listen
[02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:35.440]  I've already had a bunch of guests on
[02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:36.440]  that have been extremely powerful
[02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:38.440]  and Owen Benjamin's always great
[02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:40.440]  one of the top comedians in the country
[02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:42.440]  and one of the most censored people in the country
[02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:44.440]  and I liked seeing him popping on our shows
[02:09:44.440 --> 02:09:46.440]  for us the hour, I do intend to take a few calls
[02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:48.440]  and a few segments as well
[02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:50.440]  there's a bunch of clips I haven't gotten to
[02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:52.440]  of just the most bizarre stuff
[02:09:52.440 --> 02:09:54.440]  and I like the fact that Owen Benjamin
[02:09:54.440 --> 02:09:57.440]  talks about rhetoric
[02:09:57.440 --> 02:09:59.440]  because he's researched that
[02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:02.440]  because I want to get his take on
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:04.440]  every channel
[02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:06.440]  we already played these clips last hour saying
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:08.440]  it's crazy, there's no
[02:10:08.440 --> 02:10:10.440]  human trafficking
[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:12.440]  Trump says it, it's insane
[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:14.440]  there's no caravan
[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:17.440]  it's totally made up, he's insane
[02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:19.440]  meanwhile, Europe's been flooded
[02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:21.440]  we're being flooded, mass death
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:23.440]  huge amounts of sex trading
[02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:26.440]  Senate reports, all this stuff
[02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:28.440]  80% of the women are right, Trump says
[02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:30.440]  one third are and they go fact check
[02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:32.440]  it's 80%, you liar, it's way worse
[02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:34.440]  wait, CBS take it down, oh god
[02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:36.440]  it's our own liberal
[02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:38.440]  Amos International
[02:10:38.440 --> 02:10:40.440]  this is not even a tactic now
[02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:42.440]  this is like an obstinate
[02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:45.440]  five-year-old that you catch
[02:10:45.440 --> 02:10:47.440]  you know, pissing in their bed
[02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:49.440]  and you say, hey, don't piss in your bed again
[02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:51.440]  or you can't go over to your buddy's house
[02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:53.440]  and they're like, I didn't piss in the bed
[02:10:53.440 --> 02:10:55.440]  I'm like, what's this piss?
[02:10:55.440 --> 02:10:57.440]  I mean at a certain point, Owen Benjamin
[02:10:57.440 --> 02:10:59.440]  what is this tactic or is it just now mental illness?
[02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:01.440]  it's wizardry
[02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:03.440]  I call it wizardry
[02:11:03.440 --> 02:11:05.440]  because it's a lot easier for people to understand
[02:11:05.440 --> 02:11:07.440]  what that means as opposed to the word rhetoric
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:10.440]  because my dad taught
[02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:12.440]  rhetoric like mass persuasion
[02:11:12.440 --> 02:11:14.440]  and my mom taught children's literature
[02:11:14.440 --> 02:11:16.440]  which is basically how to boil down a narrative
[02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:18.440]  to the simplest element
[02:11:18.440 --> 02:11:20.440]  so that was my upbringing
[02:11:20.440 --> 02:11:22.440]  and it's so interesting watching all these tactics
[02:11:22.440 --> 02:11:24.440]  in real time right now
[02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:26.440]  just changing the course of a nation
[02:11:26.440 --> 02:11:28.440]  and what they're doing, it's repetition
[02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:30.440]  it's just saying the same thing
[02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:32.440]  over and over and over again
[02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:34.440]  it allows people that don't want to face
[02:11:34.440 --> 02:11:36.440]  the reality of fentanyl
[02:11:36.440 --> 02:11:38.440]  and the reality of the
[02:11:38.440 --> 02:11:40.440]  rapes happening
[02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:42.440]  as people flood the border
[02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:44.440]  and the reality that a nation can't exist
[02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:46.440]  without a border
[02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:48.440]  and the reality that the very people
[02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:50.440]  that are going against Trump
[02:11:50.440 --> 02:11:52.440]  they're on camera saying that we need a border wall
[02:11:52.440 --> 02:11:54.440]  10 years ago
[02:11:54.440 --> 02:11:56.440]  and so what's happening is it allows
[02:11:56.440 --> 02:11:58.440]  well I forgot that
[02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:00.440]  we've got hundreds of clips of Hillary
[02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:02.440]  and Schumer and Pelosi
[02:12:02.440 --> 02:12:04.440]  and Obama and Bill Clinton saying
[02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:06.440]  all the crime, a lot of criminals
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:08.440]  it's all true, but somehow they flipped
[02:12:08.440 --> 02:12:10.440]  and now say it's totally insane
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:12.440]  well yeah, well that's the thing that Trump's doing
[02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:14.440]  is he's actually doing what he said he would do
[02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:16.440]  and that's seen as
[02:12:16.440 --> 02:12:18.440]  as evil by a lot of these people
[02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:20.440]  it's almost like the family
[02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:22.440]  whose dad left when they were kids
[02:12:22.440 --> 02:12:24.440]  and the mom just keeps saying
[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:26.440]  dad will come back and that hope
[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:28.440]  allows people to get
[02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:30.440]  to get through Christmas
[02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:32.440]  even though dad's never coming back
[02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:34.440]  and that's how politics work in America now
[02:12:34.440 --> 02:12:36.440]  where they say
[02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:38.440]  border security, you know
[02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:40.440]  will tighten up government spending
[02:12:40.440 --> 02:12:42.440]  and then they never do
[02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:44.440]  and that promise and then the lack
[02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:46.440]  of doing anything is okay
[02:12:46.440 --> 02:12:48.440]  on the American people right now because
[02:12:48.440 --> 02:12:50.440]  their attention span is that of goldfish
[02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:52.440]  so the wizardry
[02:12:52.440 --> 02:12:54.440]  is going crazy and then
[02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:56.440]  Trump just doing what he said he would do
[02:12:56.440 --> 02:12:58.440]  like leaving Syria when they see that
[02:12:58.440 --> 02:13:00.440]  No I know, but then I tune in and they're all
[02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:02.440]  saying the sky's not blue
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:04.440]  it makes me feel
[02:13:04.440 --> 02:13:06.440]  not even angry anymore it's like
[02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:08.440]  who the hell are these people
[02:13:08.440 --> 02:13:10.440]  these people are dangerous as hell
[02:13:10.440 --> 02:13:12.440]  they do not need control of the nuclear weapons
[02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:14.440]  No they're wizards
[02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:16.440]  they have a narrative
[02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:18.440]  and a narrative is very very powerful
[02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:20.440]  and just like what people do with children
[02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:22.440]  or what people do with mass propaganda
[02:13:22.440 --> 02:13:24.440]  and psychological operations
[02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:26.440]  it's just a narrative
[02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:28.440]  repetition, repetition
[02:13:28.440 --> 02:13:30.440]  triggers, emotional triggers
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:32.440]  and it's
[02:13:32.440 --> 02:13:34.440]  there's millions of people like me and you
[02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:36.440]  who watch
[02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:38.440]  your show, watch my live streams
[02:13:38.440 --> 02:13:40.440]  and they feel just like us
[02:13:40.440 --> 02:13:42.440]  it's just madness
[02:13:42.440 --> 02:13:44.440]  but it's effective on a certain type of person
[02:13:44.440 --> 02:13:46.440]  I agree, a certain type that doesn't have a memory
[02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:48.440]  you read the globalist documents
[02:13:48.440 --> 02:13:50.440]  they say the K is
[02:13:50.440 --> 02:13:52.440]  they have no memory we were successful
[02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:54.440]  getting rid of attention spans
[02:13:54.440 --> 02:13:56.440]  because they have people, the average person
[02:13:56.440 --> 02:13:58.440]  does not remember any of this
[02:13:58.440 --> 02:14:00.440]  yeah that's why my mom
[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:02.440]  I used to think she was wacky
[02:14:02.440 --> 02:14:04.440]  for this policy but she
[02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:06.440]  for her wristwatch has to have
[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:08.440]  hands on it because she said
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:10.440]  a digital watch erases memory
[02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:12.440]  and she said she wants to know where
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:14.440]  the hand came from
[02:14:14.440 --> 02:14:16.440]  and where it's going and I used to think that
[02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:18.440]  that was weird and now I totally understand
[02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:20.440]  where she's coming from that it's the littlest things
[02:14:20.440 --> 02:14:22.440]  in your day
[02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:24.440]  no exactly because an old fashioned watch
[02:14:24.440 --> 02:14:26.440]  is a map of a universe
[02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:28.440]  and you know there was time before and after
[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:30.440]  but digital's only now
[02:14:30.440 --> 02:14:32.440]  exactly, well that's heavy
[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:34.440]  does your mom come up with that? that's damn heavy
[02:14:34.440 --> 02:14:36.440]  yeah my mom's brilliant with this stuff
[02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:38.440]  she's very very uh
[02:14:38.440 --> 02:14:40.440]  we never had new clothes
[02:14:40.440 --> 02:14:42.440]  and we grew our food
[02:14:42.440 --> 02:14:44.440]  and she was doing all that stuff
[02:14:44.440 --> 02:14:46.440]  before it was cool
[02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:48.440]  because she saw it coming a mile away
[02:14:48.440 --> 02:14:50.440]  and she quit working to raise
[02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:52.440]  my brother and I
[02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:54.440]  feminist said that she was giving up
[02:14:54.440 --> 02:14:56.440]  and she was like no feminism
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:14:58.440]  means I get to choose my life and I want
[02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:00.440]  to be a mother and so she was way ahead of the curve
[02:15:00.440 --> 02:15:02.440]  and that watch
[02:15:02.440 --> 02:15:04.440]  thing is so true
[02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:06.440]  and you can apply it to so many things
[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:08.440]  where digital is
[02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:10.440]  authoritarian when it says it is 1215
[02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:12.440]  it is 1115 but if you see
[02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:14.440]  the hands where they come from and where they're going
[02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:16.440]  you can put your world into context
[02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:18.440]  and the one thing
[02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:20.440]  and you also wind it and you check the time
[02:15:20.440 --> 02:15:22.440]  yourself and it's you
[02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:24.440]  control time instead of it being this digital thing
[02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:26.440]  exactly yeah
[02:15:26.440 --> 02:15:28.440]  and you're responsible for keeping it going
[02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:30.440]  there's so much
[02:15:30.440 --> 02:15:32.440]  metaphor in that and slaves
[02:15:32.440 --> 02:15:34.440]  are not allowed to have context
[02:15:34.440 --> 02:15:36.440]  and they're trying to turn us all into slaves
[02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:38.440]  that is heavy
[02:15:38.440 --> 02:15:40.440]  I mean that's like when Trump said the deepest
[02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:42.440]  thing I ever did was becoming shallow
[02:15:42.440 --> 02:15:44.440]  they go what an idiot no he means go with your first
[02:15:44.440 --> 02:15:46.440]  approximation that's actually what's deep
[02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:48.440]  Owen Benjamin is our guest
