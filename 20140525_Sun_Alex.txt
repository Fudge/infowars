[00:00.000 --> 00:05.140]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones
[00:12.640 --> 00:17.300]  After I've annihilated every single girl in the sorority house
[00:17.820 --> 00:23.700]  I'll take to the streets of Isla Vista and slay every single person I see there
[00:23.700 --> 00:33.800]  All those popular kids who live such lives of hedonistic pleasure while I've had to rot in loneliness for all these years
[00:34.840 --> 00:40.420]  They've all looked down upon me every time I tried to go out and join them. They've all treated me like a mouse
[00:41.880 --> 00:45.520]  Well now I will be a god compared to you
[00:46.240 --> 00:48.240]  You will all be animals
[00:48.240 --> 00:52.080]  You are animals and I will slaughter you like animals
[00:53.580 --> 00:55.580]  I'll be a god
[00:56.220 --> 01:01.860]  exacting my retribution and all those who deserve it and you do deserve it
[01:03.400 --> 01:05.900]  Well, that's Elliot Roger
[01:06.860 --> 01:09.460]  Who is the alleged shooter of
[01:10.580 --> 01:15.740]  Seven people that died well three of them he reportedly stabbed first
[01:15.740 --> 01:21.740]  So we're gonna see a move to ban guns, which we're already seeing but not knives
[01:22.460 --> 01:25.740]  and of course the California already has extremely draconian
[01:26.580 --> 01:31.140]  victim disarmament laws and it's in most cases these shooters are
[01:32.180 --> 01:34.460]  These trendies trendy wannabes
[01:35.260 --> 01:39.940]  Narcissists who are under psychiatric evaluation and drugs and I think if you study it
[01:39.940 --> 01:45.180]  I'm in has been the case in most other cases that he'll end up being on psychotropic
[01:46.260 --> 01:49.740]  The larger issue here is that the Southern Prairie Law Center
[01:51.660 --> 01:54.020]  CIA run feminist groups you name it are
[01:54.820 --> 02:01.180]  Running around in circles right now saying CC we got a ban guns and they've got some of the victims family members out
[02:01.500 --> 02:05.940]  Saying, you know, this is a monstrosity of Craven cowardice of the NRA
[02:05.940 --> 02:13.740]  Well, what about the local knife manufacturers or knife sellers are are are they the blame? No, no
[02:13.740 --> 02:18.900]  It's not the knife's fault. You know, he killed three of the seven or almost half the people
[02:19.860 --> 02:22.180]  reportedly allegedly with a
[02:23.140 --> 02:25.140]  knife stabbed
[02:26.300 --> 02:31.180]  Three people at a sorority house to death and then went off to kill quote blondes and
[02:31.180 --> 02:36.620]  I mean this guy it just comes off as an incredibly narcissistic punk creep
[02:37.300 --> 02:44.100]  Who was constantly calling the police they're reporting in the Santa Barbara news the sheriff's departments at a press conference
[02:44.420 --> 02:49.340]  If if someone he lived with he thought stole candles worth $22 or
[02:49.700 --> 02:53.340]  If he got in a fight with somebody and somebody kicked his butt, he would call the cops on him
[02:55.180 --> 02:59.340]  But I gotta tell you if he'd have gone to become a politician or a corporate leader
[02:59.340 --> 03:05.020]  He could have been a world ruler because he has this attitude of I'm gonna be a god. I'm gonna run your life
[03:05.980 --> 03:10.780]  And that's the type of people that end up being in power is is people that are absolutely weak and
[03:11.780 --> 03:13.780]  Crave dominating others
[03:15.100 --> 03:22.820]  So as I say many times we see news articles we see events that become kind of skeleton keys or Rosetta stones
[03:22.820 --> 03:27.580]  To understand a lot Elliott Rodgers parents warned police weeks before the mass shooting
[03:29.500 --> 03:33.700]  But it's just in the case of the Aurora shooter and that was government all the way
[03:34.500 --> 03:39.580]  We've gone with that in the ad nauseam. I mean that is cutting dry a staged event. Probably wasn't even the actual shooter there
[03:40.020 --> 03:44.500]  And you look at Sandy Hook. That's totally staged. I don't know if this is staged
[03:45.540 --> 03:47.620]  He looks like he's acting in this video, but
[03:47.620 --> 03:49.620]  Narcissist nut balls
[03:49.620 --> 03:52.500]  Homicidal narcissists come off like this
[03:53.740 --> 03:58.380]  Because it is this image of themselves. That's why most actors are narcissist
[03:59.380 --> 04:06.420]  And we have a lot of artificial narcissism in this very sick decadence society vendor, but hunger games connection to Sandy Hook and Aurora
[04:06.660 --> 04:09.540]  Raises conspiracy theories. That's the examiner
[04:10.460 --> 04:12.460]  I'm not going there yet
[04:13.220 --> 04:16.220]  If it turns out he was on the other side of the screen
[04:16.220 --> 04:18.940]  if it turns out he was on the CIA payroll like
[04:19.900 --> 04:27.180]  Tamerlan Zarnaev the supposed mastermind of the Boston bombings and if it turns out he had cover names and things and if it turns out
[04:27.180 --> 04:30.740]  There were drills, you know, then I'll start saying it looks like it's a staged event
[04:30.740 --> 04:33.820]  But this sick culture stages stuff on its own
[04:33.820 --> 04:39.420]  There are a lot of sick people out there and the reason we have guns notice. It was police had to take the sky out
[04:39.420 --> 04:41.980]  I guarantee he pulls this somewhere in Texas
[04:42.580 --> 04:44.580]  He's gonna get taken out
[04:44.580 --> 04:50.300]  Real quick by citizens for the cops even get there and the statistics show that we're gonna break it all down
[04:50.980 --> 04:57.500]  Straight ahead. Oh, by the way, it's up on drugsreport.com our article. A lot of people are thinking he's sexy now
[04:58.340 --> 05:01.300]  Hi folks Alex Jones here with some important information
[05:01.300 --> 05:06.300]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at my Patriots supply
[05:06.500 --> 05:09.540]  Several years ago Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment
[05:09.540 --> 05:14.540]  Frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck
[05:14.860 --> 05:20.020]  Deciding to take action a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born by Patriots
[05:20.020 --> 05:23.220]  Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding
[05:23.220 --> 05:29.100]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women
[05:29.100 --> 05:35.100]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach and that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality
[05:35.100 --> 05:43.140]  Storeable foods for my Patriots supply go to mypatriotsupply.com for slash Alex today or special offers on emergency food storage
[05:43.260 --> 05:48.740]  Or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927
[05:48.980 --> 05:57.900]  That's 866-229-0927 do business with someone who shares your values by Patriots supply dot com slash Alex
[05:57.900 --> 06:05.380]  There are of course those who do not want us to speak
[06:05.380 --> 06:06.660]  We think just let me say
[06:06.660 --> 06:12.180]  Even now orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will be on their way
[06:12.180 --> 06:13.180]  It's chance of settling
[06:13.180 --> 06:14.180]  Damn it!
[06:14.180 --> 06:15.180]  Why?
[06:15.180 --> 06:18.180]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation
[06:18.180 --> 06:21.180]  Words will always retain their power
[06:21.180 --> 06:25.180]  Words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen
[06:25.180 --> 06:27.180]  The enunciation of truth
[06:27.180 --> 06:32.180]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[06:32.180 --> 06:36.180]  You decided sir, you wanted it foolproof, you told me every television in London
[06:36.180 --> 06:40.180]  Cruelty and intolerance and oppression
[06:40.180 --> 06:44.180]  And where once you have the freedom to object, something can speak as you saw fit
[06:44.180 --> 06:50.180]  You now have sensors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and submachine
[06:50.180 --> 06:52.180]  How did this happen?
[06:52.180 --> 06:57.180]  Who's to blame? Well certainly there are those who are more responsible than others
[06:57.180 --> 06:59.180]  They will be held accountable
[06:59.180 --> 07:05.180]  But again truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror
[07:05.180 --> 07:09.180]  I know why you did it, I know you were afraid
[07:09.180 --> 07:13.180]  Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease
[07:13.180 --> 07:19.180]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense
[07:19.180 --> 07:26.180]  Fear got the best of you and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler
[07:26.180 --> 07:33.180]  He promised you order, he promised you peace and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent
[07:39.180 --> 07:42.180]  There is a war, it's happening now
[07:42.180 --> 07:47.180]  It will decide the fate of humanity, the time to choose sides has come
[07:47.180 --> 07:52.180]  We are the resistance, we are the Info War
[07:54.180 --> 08:03.180]  And we are live ladies and gentlemen on this Sunday the 25th day of May 2014
[08:03.180 --> 08:08.180]  And we have a lot of obviously vital news to cover here today
[08:08.180 --> 08:13.180]  First and foremost will be the new massive attack on the Second Amendment
[08:13.180 --> 08:18.180]  Trying to create collective guilt of all American gun owners
[08:18.180 --> 08:25.180]  For what appears to be a narcissistic, spoiled, demonic, sickening, full of himself
[08:25.180 --> 08:36.180]  Us filled, son of the director of the Hunger Games, Pig, Elliot Roger
[08:36.180 --> 08:41.180]  Who went out and stabbed three people to death and shot four other people to death
[08:41.180 --> 08:46.180]  Oh but you have to dig into the police reports and the police press conference
[08:46.180 --> 08:50.180]  To the sheriff's department's press conference in Santa Barbara
[08:50.180 --> 08:53.180]  The police were telling the truth about it
[08:53.180 --> 08:57.180]  Almost half the people that were killed were killed with a knife
[08:57.180 --> 09:02.180]  But you're not going to hear a lot about that because they haven't gotten ready to ban knives yet
[09:02.180 --> 09:06.180]  They are making people get licenses in some cities in England
[09:06.180 --> 09:12.180]  And they're trying to get a nationwide law passed that to have a butcher knife you have to have a license
[09:12.180 --> 09:18.180]  Because obviously it's butcher knives that kill tens of thousands of people every year in England
[09:18.180 --> 09:20.180]  Not criminals
[09:20.180 --> 09:23.180]  The butcher knives come out at night on their own and go around
[09:23.180 --> 09:27.180]  It's like in Japan and in China where they've got guns basically banned
[09:27.180 --> 09:31.180]  Every few weeks you hear about someone on a rampage that kills 10, 14 people
[09:31.180 --> 09:36.180]  16 people
[09:36.180 --> 09:41.180]  It's ridiculous, some homicidal killer by the way, it's not going to follow a law
[09:41.180 --> 09:44.180]  Banning a knife or banning a gun, they're going to get them, they're going to use them
[09:44.180 --> 09:48.180]  And it's places like Southern California, it's Chicago, New York, DC
[09:48.180 --> 09:52.180]  Where they have the most restrictive gun laws in the nation
[09:52.180 --> 09:56.180]  That you have the highest crime rates, and I know you as an audience know that
[09:56.180 --> 10:01.180]  The Justice Department two years ago released numbers that they tried to hide
[10:01.180 --> 10:07.180]  That since 1992 there's been a 52% violent crime drop nationwide
[10:07.180 --> 10:14.180]  And that is mainly, they have to admit that, due to concealed carry proliferating nationwide
[10:14.180 --> 10:22.180]  Within two years in Florida in the 90s of them passing concealed carry, car jackings went down 97%
[10:22.180 --> 10:28.180]  Look it up, Kenesaw, Georgia passed a law making you own a gun, crime rate dropped 90%
[10:28.180 --> 10:33.180]  Texas after concealed carry, overall crime dropped 20%
[10:33.180 --> 10:36.180]  Car jackings became almost unknown
[10:36.180 --> 10:40.180]  Remember all the car jackings in the 80s and 90s, you don't hear about those anymore do you?
[10:40.180 --> 10:44.180]  Unless it's Chicago or New York, because you try to car jack most people in Texas
[10:44.180 --> 10:49.180]  They will blow your butt off
[10:49.180 --> 10:54.180]  And having the citizens armed is just like having more cops on the street
[10:54.180 --> 10:59.180]  The criminals don't like it, and they know
[10:59.180 --> 11:04.180]  You're driving a pickup truck in Texas, you get left alone folks, because the criminals know statistically
[11:04.180 --> 11:09.180]  Somebody driving a pickup truck is going to have a gun
[11:09.180 --> 11:13.180]  That's well known in the criminal circles that they hit a hippie
[11:13.180 --> 11:15.180]  They'll go after some woman in a little car
[11:15.180 --> 11:20.180]  They'll go after folks with Obama stickers on their cars, because they know you're a chump
[11:20.180 --> 11:23.180]  And you want to be victimized
[11:23.180 --> 11:25.180]  There's a lot of facets to this story
[11:25.180 --> 11:28.180]  Quite frankly, even though it's tragic, seven people being killed
[11:28.180 --> 11:31.180]  I mean over a million Iraqis, the British Medical Journal said
[11:31.180 --> 11:35.180]  Since 2003 have died from the war, complications from it
[11:35.180 --> 11:39.180]  That's a million one actually, a million 100,000 people have died
[11:39.180 --> 11:42.180]  And that's like oh that's collateral damage, no big deal
[11:42.180 --> 11:47.180]  It's a good war, and after all, Saddam launched 9-11
[11:47.180 --> 11:51.180]  No, it was actually Saudi Arabia, but whatever, just ignore that
[11:51.180 --> 11:55.180]  Whatever, a million plus people dead
[11:55.180 --> 11:58.180]  That's okay, but then seven people die
[11:58.180 --> 12:02.180]  And you would think watching CNN, MSNBC, and the rest of the state-run media
[12:02.180 --> 12:05.180]  That the end of the world happened
[12:05.180 --> 12:11.180]  Now you watch, it's going to come out that this guy was on some type of psychotropic drugs
[12:11.180 --> 12:18.180]  It's going to come out that he was a big liberal, guaranteed
[12:18.180 --> 12:26.180]  I mean you can just listen to him, and the spoiled brat in a, what looks like a late model, BMW
[12:26.180 --> 12:32.180]  And in designer shirts, his dad was one of the main directors of the Hunger Games
[12:32.180 --> 12:34.180]  That's confirmed
[12:34.180 --> 12:40.180]  And he snatched a sniveling coward
[12:40.180 --> 12:43.180]  That he was constantly calling the police on people that lived with him
[12:43.180 --> 12:47.180]  Saying they'd stolen candles from him and stuff, and he'd attack somebody and they fought back
[12:47.180 --> 12:49.180]  And he'd call the cops on him
[12:49.180 --> 12:53.180]  You're not meant to breed, that's why the women don't want you
[12:53.180 --> 12:57.180]  Is because you're a coward and a jellyfish and a piece of trash
[12:57.180 --> 12:59.180]  The alleged shooter
[12:59.180 --> 13:02.180]  I don't know if he really did the shooting, probably did
[13:02.180 --> 13:07.180]  But I know this, the video we're about to play
[13:07.180 --> 13:11.180]  Of the reported alleged Santa Barbara shooter
[13:11.180 --> 13:14.180]  Is when I say trendy, this is what I'm talking about
[13:14.180 --> 13:19.180]  After I've annihilated every single girl in the sorority house
[13:19.180 --> 13:22.180]  I'll take to the streets of Isla Vista
[13:22.180 --> 13:28.180]  And slay every single person I see there
[13:28.180 --> 13:33.180]  All those popular kids who live such lives of hedonistic pleasure
[13:33.180 --> 13:36.180]  While I've had to rot in loneliness for all these years
[13:36.180 --> 13:40.180]  They've all looked down upon me every time I tried to go out and join them
[13:40.180 --> 13:43.180]  They've all treated me like a mouse
[13:43.180 --> 13:48.180]  Well now, I will be a god compared to you
[13:48.180 --> 13:50.180]  You will all be animals
[13:50.180 --> 13:55.180]  You are animals, and I will slaughter you like animals
[13:55.180 --> 14:00.180]  I'll be a god exacting my retribution
[14:00.180 --> 14:02.180]  And all those who deserve it
[14:02.180 --> 14:06.180]  And you do deserve it
[14:06.180 --> 14:10.180]  Man, this guy deserved to have his ass kicked, excuse my French
[14:10.180 --> 14:14.180]  I mean, before he ever did any of this
[14:14.180 --> 14:19.180]  And that's that person's problem is that he was so sheltered
[14:19.180 --> 14:21.180]  And so insecure
[14:21.180 --> 14:25.180]  I mean, not a bad looking young man overall driving a BMW
[14:25.180 --> 14:29.180]  I mean, when I was 22 years old, I could pick up unlimited
[14:29.180 --> 14:31.180]  You know, three girls a day if I wanted to
[14:31.180 --> 14:35.180]  I have no idea these type of these weirdo guys
[14:35.180 --> 14:38.180]  Who just have zero success with women
[14:38.180 --> 14:41.180]  And then they're so hateful towards everyone out there
[14:41.180 --> 14:45.180]  Because they have the issue and the women pick up on the creepiness
[14:45.180 --> 14:50.180]  Now, after he reportedly committed this atrocity
[14:50.180 --> 14:53.180]  And the story's up on infowars.com
[14:53.180 --> 14:58.180]  And it's also up on prisonplanet.com
[14:58.180 --> 15:05.180]  After this reportedly happened
[15:05.180 --> 15:08.180]  And he's now been killed by the police, reportedly
[15:08.180 --> 15:14.180]  In death, girls and boys swoon over Santa Barbara mass murderer
[15:14.180 --> 15:18.180]  And drugreport.com has massive coverage of this
[15:18.180 --> 15:21.180]  And it has a link to that story if you just want to find it right there
[15:21.180 --> 15:23.180]  It's also up on prisonplanet.com
[15:23.180 --> 15:27.180]  And they're going, oh, it's so sexy
[15:27.180 --> 15:32.180]  And something I pick up on with so-called progressives, so-called liberals
[15:32.180 --> 15:36.180]  Is that they love the slasher films, they love murder films, they love abortion
[15:36.180 --> 15:42.180]  They love Saw, I'm the producer of Saw, Mark Berg
[15:42.180 --> 15:46.180]  They love all this stuff except when it really happens
[15:46.180 --> 15:51.180]  But at a far now, they're just swooning over how sexy he is
[15:51.180 --> 15:54.180]  Because, you know, he went out and killed all these people

[15:57.180 --> 15:59.180]  From every angle coming up
[15:59.180 --> 16:04.180]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday
[16:04.180 --> 16:06.180]  About a potential court hood situation?
[16:06.180 --> 16:09.180]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd
[16:09.180 --> 16:11.180]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assigned to...

[16:15.180 --> 16:17.180]  Infowars is the tip of the spear
[16:17.180 --> 16:20.180]  Is this another false flight stage attack to take our civil liberties
[16:20.180 --> 16:23.180]  And put more Homeland Security or sticking the hands down on the fence on the streets?
[16:23.180 --> 16:27.180]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere
[16:27.180 --> 16:30.180]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.tv is designed to do

[17:02.180 --> 17:06.180]  When he comes home from work, all he ever does is play video games and go to sleep
[17:06.180 --> 17:08.180]  It's like I don't even exist
[17:08.180 --> 17:10.180]  Oh Betty, that's just awful
[17:10.180 --> 17:14.180]  Does this seem familiar? If the answer to this question is yes, then listen carefully
[17:14.180 --> 17:19.180]  Toxic pesticides, GMO foods and additives, BPA plastics, contaminated water supplies
[17:19.180 --> 17:24.180]  Many of these toxic additives are deliberately engineered to attack and weaken human masculinity
[17:24.180 --> 17:27.180]  It's part of the eugenics population control movement

[17:59.180 --> 18:03.180]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties
[18:03.180 --> 18:07.180]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated
[18:07.180 --> 18:11.180]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[18:11.180 --> 18:14.180]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents
[18:14.180 --> 18:19.180]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family
[18:19.180 --> 18:22.180]  From the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water
[18:22.180 --> 18:26.180]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week
[18:26.180 --> 18:30.180]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide
[18:30.180 --> 18:36.180]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate
[18:36.180 --> 18:40.180]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in breads and toothpaste
[18:40.180 --> 18:43.180]  It is our responsibility to protect our families
[18:43.180 --> 18:45.180]  The establishment's not going to do it
[18:45.180 --> 18:48.180]  It's time to take action, it's time to filter our water

[18:59.180 --> 19:03.180]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself
[19:03.180 --> 19:06.180]  Our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day
[19:06.180 --> 19:09.180]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic
[19:09.180 --> 19:14.180]  Outdoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air
[19:14.180 --> 19:19.180]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes
[19:19.180 --> 19:22.180]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States
[19:22.180 --> 19:26.180]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions
[19:26.180 --> 19:31.180]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well
[19:31.180 --> 19:36.180]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs
[19:36.180 --> 19:41.180]  In order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against

[20:39.180 --> 20:41.180]  And now at info wars
[20:43.180 --> 20:45.180]  Let me just read you some of these headlines
[20:45.180 --> 20:49.180]  California shooting exploited by SPLC and feminist
[20:49.180 --> 20:52.180]  Hunger Games connection to Sandy Hook and Aurora
[20:52.180 --> 20:54.180]  Raises conspiracy theories
[20:54.180 --> 20:56.180]  That was an article from last year
[20:56.180 --> 21:03.180]  Now it turns out that there's a connection to this with him being the second director on the Hunger Games
[21:03.180 --> 21:08.180]  The father who now the AP is reporting warned
[21:08.180 --> 21:13.180]  The family warned that he was planning something to the police
[21:15.180 --> 21:20.180]  Again here's NBC News, Rampage in college town began with stabbings
[21:20.180 --> 21:26.180]  They believe he stabbed and killed three people before going and shooting and killing four more
[21:26.180 --> 21:28.180]  Wounding as least seven others
[21:29.180 --> 21:31.180]  But again, that's just buried
[21:32.180 --> 21:34.180]  That he used a knife to kill the first three people
[21:37.180 --> 21:40.180]  He looks like an incredibly cowardly little jellyfish
[21:40.180 --> 21:43.180]  I'm surprised he could kill three people with a knife that takes some will
[21:44.180 --> 21:46.180]  I don't know, we're gonna investigate this folks
[21:46.180 --> 21:49.180]  It does stink pretty bad, but we'll continue to track it
[21:49.180 --> 21:52.180]  He could have thought he was shooting a spoo for a film
[21:53.180 --> 21:55.180]  Being egged on by a handler
[21:55.180 --> 21:59.180]  Or somebody that quote wound him up, that's what they call it in psyops
[21:59.180 --> 22:01.180]  And then he shows up to be part of it
[22:01.180 --> 22:03.180]  They shoot and kill people and blame him
[22:03.180 --> 22:05.180]  I'm not saying that's what happened
[22:05.180 --> 22:09.180]  But that's what happened with Sirhan Sirhan and RFK
[22:09.180 --> 22:12.180]  Even the police report basically says that from LA
[22:12.180 --> 22:14.180]  So this stuff's gone on before
[22:14.180 --> 22:17.180]  I'm not saying it isn't real right now
[22:17.180 --> 22:20.180]  In fact, my listeners are on infowars.com in the comments
[22:20.180 --> 22:23.180]  Pretty mad since we had articles up yesterday
[22:23.180 --> 22:26.180]  Saying that I'm not immediately jumping to that conclusion
[22:26.180 --> 22:29.180]  If it turns out they had a drill of this happening at the same time
[22:29.180 --> 22:30.180]  Same place
[22:30.180 --> 22:33.180]  If it turns out he was on the CIA payroll like Tamerlan Zarnev
[22:33.180 --> 22:35.180]  The supposed mastermind of the Boston bombings
[22:35.180 --> 22:38.180]  If it turns out there was a stand down
[22:38.180 --> 22:43.180]  If it turns out a top Air Force psychiatrist in psychological warfare
[22:43.180 --> 22:48.180]  Is the psychiatrist for the shooter like it was in Aurora
[22:48.180 --> 22:51.180]  Then I will start to think some things are going
[22:51.180 --> 22:53.180]  By the way, it turned out he was a big fan
[22:53.180 --> 22:56.180]  Their reporting will put it back on screen
[22:56.180 --> 22:59.180]  Of American Psycho
[22:59.180 --> 23:01.180]  He mimicked American Psycho
[23:01.180 --> 23:04.180]  He wanted to be a star killer
[23:07.180 --> 23:09.180]  Killer virgin acted out a film role
[23:09.180 --> 23:13.180]  Because he felt like a failure in reality says criminologist
[23:13.180 --> 23:16.180]  Yeah, that's what a lot of mentally ill people do
[23:16.180 --> 23:18.180]  Is they'll pick up on a film or a book
[23:18.180 --> 23:21.180]  And then they will basically follow that as their script
[23:21.180 --> 23:24.180]  But then it's hard to distinguish from mind control
[23:24.180 --> 23:28.180]  Because in mind control, they put you in artificially mentally ill space
[23:28.180 --> 23:31.180]  And then use something, a book or a film, a program as well
[23:31.180 --> 23:34.180]  So that's why it's very hard to differentiate
[23:34.180 --> 23:37.180]  But you look at Aurora
[23:37.180 --> 23:43.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is extremely, extremely nailed down
[23:43.180 --> 23:44.180]  That that was a staged event
[23:44.180 --> 23:46.180]  And that the person that did the shooting
[23:46.180 --> 23:50.180]  Was not even the person that really did do the shooting
[23:50.180 --> 23:54.180]  Director Sun, kill six, wound seven
[23:54.180 --> 24:00.180]  Elliot Rodgers, the 22 year old son of director Peter Rodgers
[24:00.180 --> 24:04.180]  Both Aurora, Sandy Hook, and now this have connections
[24:04.180 --> 24:08.180]  In Sandy Hook, the writer of the novels lives there
[24:08.180 --> 24:13.180]  I mean, this is just getting weirder and weirder and weirder by the minute
[24:17.180 --> 24:19.180]  Father of Rampage victim
[24:19.180 --> 24:23.180]  When will this insanity stop, he says to CNN
[24:23.180 --> 24:25.180]  He was really a great kid
[24:25.180 --> 24:27.180]  Whose death has left our family lost and broken
[24:27.180 --> 24:29.180]  Richard Martinez said of a son
[24:29.180 --> 24:31.180]  Our family has a message for every parent out there
[24:31.180 --> 24:34.180]  You don't think it will happen to your child until it does
[24:34.180 --> 24:36.180]  The visibly emotional parent said
[24:36.180 --> 24:40.180]  His voice raising to a shout in obvious agony
[24:40.180 --> 24:41.180]  Why did Chris die?
[24:41.180 --> 24:43.180]  Chris died because of a craven
[24:43.180 --> 24:45.180]  I mean, I guess cowardly
[24:45.180 --> 24:48.180]  Irresponsible politicians and the NRA
[24:48.180 --> 24:50.180]  They talk about gun rights
[24:50.180 --> 24:52.180]  What about Chris's right to live, he continued
[24:52.180 --> 24:55.180]  Well, what about my right to not be stabbed by killers
[24:55.180 --> 24:56.180]  Or shot by killers?
[24:56.180 --> 24:58.180]  What about my right to protect myself, sir?
[24:58.180 --> 25:01.180]  I'm sorry you lost your son
[25:01.180 --> 25:04.180]  But it's the society that produces sickos
[25:04.180 --> 25:07.180]  Like Elliot Rodger is the reason your son's dead
[25:07.180 --> 25:10.180]  Over 200,000 people die in car wrecks every year
[25:10.180 --> 25:13.180]  A third of them are more or under the age of 22
[25:13.180 --> 25:16.180]  Because a lot of wrecks are young people who don't know how to drive
[25:16.180 --> 25:20.180]  Parents don't think their kid's going to die on a car wreck until it happens
[25:22.180 --> 25:24.180]  Are you going to blame cars?
[25:24.180 --> 25:28.180]  You don't think you're going to die on a house fire until it happens
[25:29.180 --> 25:31.180]  I mean, thousands die a year getting fistfights
[25:31.180 --> 25:34.180]  And fall down and hit their heads
[25:38.180 --> 25:42.180]  Suicide with a firearm is one of the least common ways to die
[25:42.180 --> 25:45.180]  I'm just tired of the perception that guns are doing this
[25:45.180 --> 25:47.180]  And gun owners are doing it
[25:47.180 --> 25:50.180]  I will not apologize for your son's death
[25:50.180 --> 25:55.180]  Mr. Martinez, I'm sorry for your son's death and your loss
[25:55.180 --> 25:57.180]  But I had nothing to do with it
[25:57.180 --> 26:00.180]  And I will not take the collective blame of the scyop
[26:00.180 --> 26:05.180]  For some sick freak who allegedly killed your son and stabbed other people
[26:05.180 --> 26:07.180]  I have nothing to do with that
[26:07.180 --> 26:09.180]  I've never committed a crime with a gun
[26:10.180 --> 26:12.180]  My guns make us safer
[26:12.180 --> 26:16.180]  Statistically, don't you blame me anymore
[26:16.180 --> 26:18.180]  Let's play the father, here it is
[26:18.180 --> 26:20.180]  Chris was a really great kid
[26:21.180 --> 26:23.180]  Ask anyone who knew him
[26:24.180 --> 26:29.180]  His death has left our family lost and broken
[26:30.180 --> 26:32.180]  Why did Chris die?
[26:33.180 --> 26:39.180]  Chris died because of craven, irresponsible politicians and the NRA
[26:40.180 --> 26:42.180]  They talk about gun rights
[26:42.180 --> 26:45.180]  What about Chris's right to live?
[26:45.180 --> 26:49.180]  When will this insanity stop?
[26:49.180 --> 26:52.180]  When will the insanity stop that you have
[26:52.180 --> 26:56.180]  Mexico has total gunmen for citizens' highest crime rate in the world
[26:56.180 --> 26:58.180]  When will it stop?
[26:58.180 --> 27:00.180]  The citizens armed themselves in one state
[27:00.180 --> 27:03.180]  Five years ago it spread to a bunch of states
[27:03.180 --> 27:05.180]  The crime rates have plunged in those areas
[27:05.180 --> 27:09.180]  Because the local farmers and ranchers that got guns illegally in the U.S.
[27:10.180 --> 27:12.180]  Are not using the guns that rob people
[27:12.180 --> 27:14.180]  They've used it to stop the criminals in the government
[27:14.180 --> 27:16.180]  So now the Mexican government said
[27:16.180 --> 27:18.180]  Okay, I guess we can start arming rural communities
[27:19.180 --> 27:22.180]  It'll stop when we hit rock bottom, Mr. Martinez
[27:23.180 --> 27:24.180]  Like Mexico
[27:24.180 --> 27:28.180]  When will 25, 30 deaths a week
[27:28.180 --> 27:30.180]  Sometimes a weekend in Chicago stop
[27:31.180 --> 27:33.180]  When the gun ban ends
[27:35.180 --> 27:37.180]  So that's what we're talking about here
[27:38.180 --> 27:40.180]  I'm going to tell you right now
[27:40.180 --> 27:43.180]  How dare you try to collectively blame gun owners
[27:43.180 --> 27:45.180]  For your son's death
[27:45.180 --> 27:47.180]  And say when will the insanity stop
[27:47.180 --> 27:49.180]  How dare you ignore the statistics
[27:49.180 --> 27:52.180]  A 52% drop in violent crimes
[27:52.180 --> 27:54.180]  Since massive gun ownership increased
[27:54.180 --> 27:57.180]  In the last 20 years, just departments own numbers
[27:57.180 --> 27:59.180]  I mean, I'll say it, how dare you
[27:59.180 --> 28:01.180]  I did nothing to your son
[28:01.180 --> 28:03.180]  Nothing, I'm a gun owner
[28:03.180 --> 28:07.180]  And I'm sick of collectively hearing gun owners cause the dead people at Sandy Hook
[28:07.180 --> 28:09.180]  No, no, no, no
[28:09.180 --> 28:10.180]  No
[28:10.180 --> 28:12.180]  And I reject it
[28:12.180 --> 28:15.180]  The so-called left pushes guilt
[28:15.180 --> 28:18.180]  And then well-meaning people like Mr. Martinez pick it up
[28:19.180 --> 28:21.180]  In their pain
[28:21.180 --> 28:23.180]  So how dare the people that are manipulating Mr. Martinez
[28:23.180 --> 28:25.180]  They're the real problem here
[28:25.180 --> 28:27.180]  I'm sad for Mr. Martinez
[28:27.180 --> 28:29.180]  But I will not take any of the guilt
[28:30.180 --> 28:33.180]  It's like support Obamacare or your racist
[28:33.180 --> 28:35.180]  That's what Senator Jay Rockefeller said this week
[28:35.180 --> 28:37.180]  He played the clip Friday

[31:13.180 --> 31:15.180]  Oh, I know it's tough to talk about this with some people
[31:15.180 --> 31:17.180]  They might call you names
[31:17.180 --> 31:19.180]  Or they just want to talk about sports

[31:33.180 --> 31:35.180]  For the greater part of the last thousand years
[31:35.180 --> 31:37.180]  And I'm still fighting
[31:37.180 --> 31:39.180]  If we don't all stand up right now

[33:10.180 --> 33:12.180]  In this present crisis
[33:12.180 --> 33:15.180]  Government is not the solution to our problem
[33:15.180 --> 33:18.180]  Government is the problem
[33:20.180 --> 33:23.180]  From time to time we've been tempted to believe
[33:23.180 --> 33:25.180]  Society has become too complex
[33:25.180 --> 33:28.180]  To be managed by self-rule
[33:28.180 --> 33:31.180]  That government by an elite group is superior
[33:31.180 --> 33:36.180]  To government for, by and of the people
[33:36.180 --> 33:38.180]  The Alex Jones show
[33:38.180 --> 33:42.180]  Because there is a war on for your mind

[33:53.180 --> 33:55.180]  They must stain
[33:55.180 --> 33:57.180]  Fellow patriot
[33:57.180 --> 33:58.180]  Bringing us in
[33:58.180 --> 34:00.180]  Still a bit fuzzy
[34:00.180 --> 34:03.180]  Speak of mutually assured destruction
[34:03.180 --> 34:06.180]  Nice story, talk of destruction
[34:08.180 --> 34:11.180]  Elliot Rodger, son of Hunger Games
[34:11.180 --> 34:15.180]  Director, vowed to slaughter women who rejected him
[34:16.180 --> 34:18.180]  What a creep
[34:18.180 --> 34:21.180]  Absolutely disgusting
[34:22.180 --> 34:24.180]  And CNN's answer
[34:24.180 --> 34:26.180]  And the Southern Prairie Law Center's answer
[34:26.180 --> 34:29.180]  Is blame gun owners and restrict the Second Amendment
[34:29.180 --> 34:32.180]  Well, you've got some of the worst restrictions in the country
[34:32.180 --> 34:34.180]  In Southern California
[34:35.180 --> 34:37.180]  And did it stop a cop
[34:37.180 --> 34:40.180]  Born her going on a rampage and killing people?
[34:40.180 --> 34:43.180]  No, it took people with guns to stop him
[34:43.180 --> 34:46.180]  And it was people with guns to stop this guy
[34:46.180 --> 34:50.180]  Because it's a good guy with a gun to stop a bad guy with a gun
[34:51.180 --> 34:54.180]  And the places where you've got less good guys with guns
[34:54.180 --> 34:58.180]  Like New York, Chicago, LA, DC, you name it
[34:58.180 --> 35:00.180]  Is where you have the highest crime rates
[35:00.180 --> 35:02.180]  And I know I keep hammering that
[35:02.180 --> 35:06.180]  It's disgusting to watch the media preying
[35:06.180 --> 35:09.180]  On these parents who are living out in California
[35:09.180 --> 35:11.180]  They chose to live with a higher crime rate
[35:11.180 --> 35:14.180]  They chose to live in a victim disarmament zone
[35:14.180 --> 35:17.180]  They chose to live in the heart of narcissism and mental illness
[35:19.180 --> 35:21.180]  I like Central and Northern California
[35:21.180 --> 35:23.180]  But Southern California is la-la land, folks
[35:24.180 --> 35:28.180]  And I will not be blamed
[35:28.180 --> 35:31.180]  I will not sit back and watch Fox Sports and CNN
[35:31.180 --> 35:34.180]  Say that the MRA is the new KKK
[35:34.180 --> 35:36.180]  When they were founded to fight the KKK
[35:36.180 --> 35:38.180]  I mean, I'm just tired of it
[35:38.180 --> 35:41.180]  And I'm not going to hear a bunch of fascists like Obama
[35:41.180 --> 35:45.180]  Tell me that they're liberals when Thomas Jefferson was a liberal
[35:45.180 --> 35:46.180]  I'm a liberal
[35:46.180 --> 35:48.180]  I want more personal freedom
[35:48.180 --> 35:52.180]  More property rights, lower taxes, more family rights
[35:52.180 --> 35:53.180]  Not a bigger government
[35:53.180 --> 35:56.180]  And no amount of government is going to stop
[35:56.180 --> 35:58.180]  What's happening in this country
[36:00.180 --> 36:03.180]  We shouldn't be blaming the knife or the gun he used to do this
[36:03.180 --> 36:05.180]  He killed 40%
[36:06.180 --> 36:08.180]  I don't know, was 3 out of 7
[36:08.180 --> 36:09.180]  37%
[36:09.180 --> 36:11.180]  He almost killed half the people with the knife
[36:11.180 --> 36:13.180]  No discussion of banning knives
[36:17.180 --> 36:19.180]  It's the exact same thing with a gun
[36:19.180 --> 36:21.180]  I want to take your calls
[36:21.180 --> 36:24.180]  I want to play his full 7 minute disgusting manifesto right now
[36:24.180 --> 36:25.180]  And comment over it
[36:25.180 --> 36:27.180]  And then we'll get into other facets of it
[36:27.180 --> 36:29.180]  But the full cover is at infowars.com
[36:29.180 --> 36:31.180]  The most disgusting thing I've seen so far
[36:31.180 --> 36:33.180]  And it's all over Twitter and Facebook
[36:33.180 --> 36:38.180]  Is now all these girls who get into death and vampires
[36:38.180 --> 36:40.180]  And murder
[36:40.180 --> 36:42.180]  And I always noticed that so-called leftists
[36:42.180 --> 36:44.180]  Are so into death, murder, torture, killing
[36:44.180 --> 36:46.180]  They think it's sexy and powerful
[36:46.180 --> 36:48.180]  Until it happens to them
[36:48.180 --> 36:49.180]  Or someone they know
[36:49.180 --> 36:52.180]  But then at a far there's all these guys too
[36:52.180 --> 36:55.180]  All these gay guys going, oh he's so sexy
[36:55.180 --> 36:56.180]  And all these girls
[36:56.180 --> 36:57.180]  No one looks at their profile
[36:57.180 --> 36:59.180]  They're like, ooh he's sexy, ooh
[37:00.180 --> 37:01.180]  So he got what he wanted
[37:04.180 --> 37:07.180]  You know so many women won't go after a real man
[37:07.180 --> 37:09.180]  Who treats them well but strong
[37:09.180 --> 37:11.180]  They'll go after some fake thug punk
[37:14.180 --> 37:17.180]  And it's disgusting to say the least
[37:17.180 --> 37:20.180]  But don't worry Southern Poverty Law Center and others
[37:23.180 --> 37:26.180]  Are openly trying to blame gun owners collectively
[37:27.180 --> 37:30.180]  Let's go ahead and go to the YouTube manifesto
[37:30.180 --> 37:32.180]  Posted the day before he reportedly
[37:32.180 --> 37:34.180]  Went on the rampage of Elliot Roger
[37:34.180 --> 37:37.180]  It's really hard to listen to, watching it
[37:37.180 --> 37:39.180]  Is over the top bizarre, here it is
[37:40.180 --> 37:43.180]  Hi, Elliot Roger here
[37:43.180 --> 37:44.180]  Hi
[37:45.180 --> 37:48.180]  Well, this is my last video
[37:49.180 --> 37:51.180]  It all has to come to this
[37:51.180 --> 37:52.180]  Is your spoiled brat punk
[37:52.180 --> 37:55.180]  Tomorrow is the day of retribution
[37:55.180 --> 37:57.180]  Yeah, everything given to him is a rich kid
[37:57.180 --> 38:00.180]  The day in which I will have my revenge
[38:00.180 --> 38:01.180]  Against humanity
[38:01.180 --> 38:03.180]  What do you call it CJ? What's the term you call it?
[38:03.180 --> 38:05.180]  What's the term you call it?
[38:06.180 --> 38:07.180]  Affluenza
[38:07.180 --> 38:08.180]  For the last eight years of my life
[38:08.180 --> 38:09.180]  Affluenza
[38:09.180 --> 38:10.180]  Ever since I've had puberty
[38:10.180 --> 38:11.180]  Affluenza
[38:11.180 --> 38:13.180]  I've been forced to endure an existence
[38:13.180 --> 38:18.180]  Of loneliness, rejection, and unfulfilled desire
[38:18.180 --> 38:19.180]  Don't buy a hooker if you got to
[38:19.180 --> 38:20.180]  You punk
[38:20.180 --> 38:22.180]  But girls have never been attracted to me
[38:24.180 --> 38:26.180]  Girls gave their affection
[38:27.180 --> 38:28.180]  And sex
[38:29.180 --> 38:31.180]  And love to other men
[38:31.180 --> 38:32.180]  But never to me
[38:32.180 --> 38:34.180]  So I'm going to kill them
[38:34.180 --> 38:35.180]  I'm 22 years old
[38:35.180 --> 38:37.180]  And I'm still a virgin
[38:37.180 --> 38:38.180]  Oh my gosh
[38:38.180 --> 38:40.180]  I've never even kissed a girl
[38:40.180 --> 38:41.180]  Oh my gosh
[38:41.180 --> 38:43.180]  I've been through college
[38:43.180 --> 38:45.180]  For two and a half years
[38:45.180 --> 38:47.180]  More than that, actually
[38:48.180 --> 38:50.180]  And I'm still a virgin
[38:50.180 --> 38:51.180]  Well, walk in a room of women
[38:51.180 --> 38:52.180]  And ask ten of them out
[38:52.180 --> 38:54.180]  Three of them go out with you
[38:54.180 --> 38:56.180]  College is the time when
[38:56.180 --> 38:58.180]  Everyone experiences those things
[38:58.180 --> 39:00.180]  Such as sex and fun
[39:00.180 --> 39:02.180]  What a spoiled punk, man
[39:02.180 --> 39:04.180]  This is what the bubble society does
[39:08.180 --> 39:09.180]  It's not fair
[39:09.180 --> 39:11.180]  So you're going to kill about your random people
[39:11.180 --> 39:14.180]  You girls have never been attracted to me
[39:14.180 --> 39:17.180]  I don't know why you girls aren't attracted to me
[39:17.180 --> 39:19.180]  But I will punish you all for it
[39:19.180 --> 39:21.180]  Because you're a slimy piece of crap, that's why
[39:21.180 --> 39:23.180]  It's an injustice, a crime
[39:23.180 --> 39:26.180]  Because I don't know what you don't see in me
[39:26.180 --> 39:28.180]  I'm the perfect guy
[39:28.180 --> 39:30.180]  I'd like to take a baseball bat to his face
[39:30.180 --> 39:32.180]  And you've heard of girls and all these
[39:32.180 --> 39:34.180]  Obnoxious men
[39:34.180 --> 39:35.180]  Instead of me
[39:35.180 --> 39:36.180]  A torp
[39:36.180 --> 39:38.180]  A supreme gentleman
[39:38.180 --> 39:40.180]  What a creep, man
[39:40.180 --> 39:42.180]  I will punish all of you for it
[39:42.180 --> 39:44.180]  Listen to this narcissist
[39:46.180 --> 39:48.180]  Listen to that evil lat
[39:48.180 --> 39:50.180]  On the day of retribution
[39:50.180 --> 39:52.180]  I am going to enter
[39:52.180 --> 39:54.180]  The hottest sorority house
[39:54.180 --> 39:58.180]  Of UCSB
[40:00.180 --> 40:02.180]  And I will slaughter
[40:02.180 --> 40:04.180]  Every single spoiled
[40:04.180 --> 40:06.180]  Stuck-up blonde slut
[40:06.180 --> 40:08.180]  I see the side there
[40:08.180 --> 40:10.180]  Every stuck-up blonde slut
[40:10.180 --> 40:12.180]  He sees in there
[40:12.180 --> 40:14.180]  I mean listen to this attitude
[40:14.180 --> 40:16.180]  And if you can't see it
[40:16.180 --> 40:18.180]  If you're not watching us on
[40:18.180 --> 40:20.180]  Infowars.com or prisonplot.tv right now
[40:20.180 --> 40:22.180]  When he talks about it, he's going to kill everybody
[40:22.180 --> 40:24.180]  He looks back and forth and really gets off on that
[40:24.180 --> 40:26.180]  A coward wanting to kill innocent women
[40:26.180 --> 40:28.180]  And this is where you get a linen
[40:28.180 --> 40:30.180]  A style and a Hitler amount
[40:30.180 --> 40:32.180]  These type of people a lot of times get into power
[40:32.180 --> 40:34.180]  And they want power and control
[40:34.180 --> 40:36.180]  Over
[40:36.180 --> 40:38.180]  Everyone who's been successful
[40:38.180 --> 40:40.180]  On their own
[40:40.180 --> 40:42.180]  That's what collectivists do by the way
[40:42.180 --> 40:44.180]  They get together as an army of scum
[40:44.180 --> 40:46.180]  To take over and make you do what they say
[40:46.180 --> 40:48.180]  How many times have you heard me say that?
[40:48.180 --> 40:52.180]  This guy is the poster child for it
[40:52.180 --> 40:54.180]  Elliot Rogers parents were desperately
[40:54.180 --> 40:56.180]  Hunting for their son during deadly shooting spree
[40:56.180 --> 40:58.180]  Another
[40:58.180 --> 41:00.180]  Sheltered spoiled millionaire kid
[41:02.180 --> 41:04.180]  Guaranteed he was in counseling and on drugs
[41:04.180 --> 41:06.180]  I bet my right arm is going to come out
[41:06.180 --> 41:08.180]  Let's go back
[41:08.180 --> 41:10.180]  To the spoiled demon
[41:10.180 --> 41:12.180]  Here it is
[41:12.180 --> 41:14.180]  All those girls that I've desired so much
[41:14.180 --> 41:16.180]  They would have all rejected me
[41:16.180 --> 41:18.180]  And looked down upon me as an inferior man
[41:18.180 --> 41:20.180]  If I ever made a sexual advance
[41:20.180 --> 41:22.180]  Towards them
[41:22.180 --> 41:24.180]  You don't make a sexual advance up front
[41:24.180 --> 41:26.180]  Idiot
[41:26.180 --> 41:28.180]  While they throw themselves at
[41:28.180 --> 41:30.180]  I don't think his dad taught him anything
[41:30.180 --> 41:32.180]  I'll take great pleasure
[41:32.180 --> 41:34.180]  In slaughtering all of you
[41:34.180 --> 41:36.180]  Oh man
[41:36.180 --> 41:38.180]  You will finally see
[41:38.180 --> 41:40.180]  That I'm
[41:40.180 --> 41:42.180]  I'm
[41:42.180 --> 41:44.180]  I'm
[41:44.180 --> 41:46.180]  You will finally see
[41:46.180 --> 41:48.180]  That I am in truth
[41:48.180 --> 41:50.180]  The superior one
[41:50.180 --> 41:52.180]  You have three children
[41:52.180 --> 41:54.180]  You just hate predators like this
[41:54.180 --> 41:56.180]  It's biological
[41:56.180 --> 41:58.180]  I'm really
[41:58.180 --> 42:00.180]  After I've annihilated
[42:00.180 --> 42:02.180]  Every single girl
[42:02.180 --> 42:04.180]  In the sorority
[42:04.180 --> 42:06.180]  I'll take to the streets of Isla Vista
[42:06.180 --> 42:08.180]  And slay
[42:08.180 --> 42:10.180]  Every single person
[42:10.180 --> 42:12.180]  You got slayed by the police
[42:12.180 --> 42:14.180]  All those popular kids
[42:14.180 --> 42:16.180]  Who live such lives
[42:16.180 --> 42:18.180]  Of hedonistic pleasure
[42:18.180 --> 42:20.180]  I bet money this guy cried for mommy when he was bleeding out
[42:20.180 --> 42:22.180]  They've all looked down upon me
[42:22.180 --> 42:24.180]  Every time I tried to go out and join them
[42:24.180 --> 42:26.180]  They've all treated me like a mouse
[42:26.180 --> 42:28.180]  Ugh
[42:28.180 --> 42:30.180]  Well now
[42:30.180 --> 42:32.180]  I will be a god compared to you
[42:32.180 --> 42:34.180]  A god
[42:34.180 --> 42:36.180]  You will all be animals
[42:36.180 --> 42:38.180]  That's what Ray Kurzweil and all of them say
[42:38.180 --> 42:40.180]  Is they're gonna be gods
[42:40.180 --> 42:42.180]  When we come back
[42:42.180 --> 42:44.180]  I want your take on this
[42:44.180 --> 42:46.180]  What do you think of this piece of garbage
[42:46.180 --> 42:48.180]  Should we turn our guns in
[42:48.180 --> 42:50.180]  So guys like this can stab us at will
[42:50.180 --> 42:52.180]  Should we ban all butcher knives
[42:52.180 --> 42:54.180]  877-789
[42:54.180 --> 42:56.180]  Alex 877-789
[42:56.180 --> 42:58.180]  2539
[42:58.180 --> 43:00.180]  Stay with us
[43:00.180 --> 43:02.180]  From the water table
[43:02.180 --> 43:04.180]  To our soils
[43:04.180 --> 43:06.180]  To the atmosphere itself
[43:06.180 --> 43:08.180]  Our world is becoming more and more toxic
[43:08.180 --> 43:10.180]  The air outside that's toxic
[43:10.180 --> 43:12.180]  Indoor air has been shown to have 2-5 times higher concentrations
[43:12.180 --> 43:14.180]  Of pollutants than even outdoor air
[43:14.180 --> 43:16.180]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time
[43:16.180 --> 43:18.180]  Inside using toxic chemicals
[43:18.180 --> 43:20.180]  Within their homes
[43:20.180 --> 43:22.180]  There are more than 42 million smokers
[43:22.180 --> 43:24.180]  In the United States
[43:24.180 --> 43:26.180]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew
[43:26.180 --> 43:28.180]  Link to numerous conditions
[43:28.180 --> 43:30.180]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans
[43:30.180 --> 43:32.180]  Live with pets they're allergic to as well
[43:32.180 --> 43:34.180]  When I began to research these statistics
[43:34.180 --> 43:36.180]  It was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[43:36.180 --> 43:38.180]  My lungs in order to combat
[43:38.180 --> 43:40.180]  The toxic environment that we cannot escape
[43:40.180 --> 43:42.180]  But that we can fight back against
[43:42.180 --> 43:44.180]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs
[43:44.180 --> 43:46.180]  And manufactured in the USA

[43:58.180 --> 44:00.180]  I don't know what it is
[44:00.180 --> 44:02.180]  Ralph just won't pay any attention to me
[44:02.180 --> 44:04.180]  When he comes home from work
[44:04.180 --> 44:06.180]  All he ever does is play video games
[44:06.180 --> 44:08.180]  And go to sleep, just like I don't even exist
[44:08.180 --> 44:10.180]  Oh Betty, that's just awful
[44:10.180 --> 44:12.180]  Does this seem familiar?
[44:12.180 --> 44:14.180]  If the answer to this question is yes, then listen carefully
[44:14.180 --> 44:16.180]  Toxic pesticides
[44:16.180 --> 44:18.180]  GMO foods and additives
[44:18.180 --> 44:20.180]  BPA plastics, contaminated water supplies
[44:20.180 --> 44:22.180]  Many of these toxic additives are deliberately engineered
[44:22.180 --> 44:24.180]  To attack and weaken human masculinity
[44:24.180 --> 44:26.180]  It's part of the eugenics population control movement
[44:26.180 --> 44:28.180]  Look it up

[44:58.180 --> 45:00.180]  General, what do you think about the FBI
[45:00.180 --> 45:02.180]  Saying that there is a terror alert on Monday
[45:02.180 --> 45:04.180]  About a potential for hood situation
[45:04.180 --> 45:06.180]  The police are shoving people
[45:06.180 --> 45:08.180]  Shoving Alex, shoving the crowd
[45:08.180 --> 45:10.180]  Here we go, folks, I'm being a sergeant
[45:10.180 --> 45:12.180]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites
[45:12.180 --> 45:14.180]  Documentary films or the nightly news
[45:14.180 --> 45:16.180]  InfoWars is the tip of the spear
[45:16.180 --> 45:18.180]  Is this another false-flight stage attack
[45:18.180 --> 45:20.180]  To take our civil liberties and promote homeland security
[45:20.180 --> 45:22.180]  Or sticking our hands down our pants on the streets
[45:22.180 --> 45:24.180]  It's up to us to set brush fires

[45:36.180 --> 45:38.180]  Against the so-called rebels
[45:38.180 --> 45:40.180]  What we see now is a war against reality
[45:40.180 --> 45:42.180]  It's a war against the truth
[45:42.180 --> 45:44.180]  It's more vital than ever
[45:44.180 --> 45:46.180]  That supporters of freedom become members

[48:28.180 --> 48:30.180]  If you just joined us
[48:30.180 --> 48:32.180]  Elliott Roger
[48:32.180 --> 48:34.180]  The son of one of the Hunger Games directors
[48:34.180 --> 48:38.180]  A spoiled brat driving what looks like a brand new BMW
[48:38.180 --> 48:42.180]  Was whining that he would make sexual advances on women
[48:42.180 --> 48:44.180]  And that he didn't have any luck
[48:44.180 --> 48:46.180]  Well I mean that's because you're just this
[48:46.180 --> 48:48.180]  Sheltered brat sicko
[48:48.180 --> 48:50.180]  Who then was in such a sick society
[48:50.180 --> 48:52.180]  That he reportedly
[48:52.180 --> 48:54.180]  And it looks like he is the shooter
[48:54.180 --> 48:56.180]  They say a ledge but I mean there's a bunch of wetnesses
[48:56.180 --> 48:58.180]  The police are basically saying he's the shooter
[48:58.180 --> 49:00.180]  And it's just disgusting
[49:00.180 --> 49:02.180]  I mean there's more and more of these people
[49:02.180 --> 49:04.180]  There's less violent crime
[49:04.180 --> 49:06.180]  Because so many people are armed
[49:06.180 --> 49:08.180]  The criminals are scared but there's statistically
[49:08.180 --> 49:10.180]  More if you profile it
[49:10.180 --> 49:12.180]  Weirdo spoiled brat guys
[49:12.180 --> 49:14.180]  That look and act just like this punk
[49:14.180 --> 49:16.180]  Who have rich parents
[49:16.180 --> 49:18.180]  Who are video game heads
[49:18.180 --> 49:20.180]  And on psychiatric medication
[49:20.180 --> 49:22.180]  I bet it comes out he's a video game shoot-em-up head
[49:22.180 --> 49:24.180]  And on psychotropic that's the profile
[49:24.180 --> 49:26.180]  Already the rich kid syndrome
[49:26.180 --> 49:28.180]  And I'm not knocking
[49:28.180 --> 49:30.180]  Somebody if you're a rich kid
[49:30.180 --> 49:32.180]  The point is the trust fund kids
[49:32.180 --> 49:34.180]  The phenomenon of the spoiled brats
[49:34.180 --> 49:36.180]  It's unbelievable
[49:36.180 --> 49:38.180]  We're putting on screen FBI statistics
[49:38.180 --> 49:40.180]  Right now showing a 52% drop
[49:40.180 --> 49:42.180]  In violent crime since 92
[49:42.180 --> 49:44.180]  Some of the most accurate statistics out there
[49:44.180 --> 49:46.180]  So I'm not taking the blame for this
[49:46.180 --> 49:48.180]  But the rest is manifesto later
[49:48.180 --> 49:50.180]  And play the end of the sickening tape
[49:50.180 --> 49:52.180]  But the video is up on infowars.com
[49:52.180 --> 49:54.180]  California shooting
[49:54.180 --> 49:56.180]  Exploited by SPLC
[49:56.180 --> 49:58.180]  And so-called feminist
[49:58.180 --> 50:00.180]  Oh my gosh, you know a man
[50:00.180 --> 50:02.180]  Went and killed women because he hated women
[50:02.180 --> 50:04.180]  Let's ban guns, no let's arm women
[50:04.180 --> 50:06.180]  That's the ultimate
[50:06.180 --> 50:08.180]  Empowerment, I have two daughters
[50:08.180 --> 50:10.180]  I couldn't imagine them growing up
[50:10.180 --> 50:12.180]  Not knowing how to shoot guns and protect themselves
[50:12.180 --> 50:14.180]  And then moving away from home
[50:14.180 --> 50:16.180]  For a job and having to sit there
[50:16.180 --> 50:18.180]  And wait for some bigger, stronger man
[50:18.180 --> 50:20.180]  To attack them or rape them
[50:20.180 --> 50:22.180]  They know how to use guns and they're going to have guns
[50:22.180 --> 50:24.180]  And we're going to keep this country somewhat free
[50:24.180 --> 50:26.180]  And they're going to have guns to protect themselves
[50:26.180 --> 50:28.180]  We don't live in fear
[50:28.180 --> 50:30.180]  Like most radio stations or networks
[50:30.180 --> 50:32.180]  Of shooters coming to our studios
[50:32.180 --> 50:34.180]  Because media is a target
[50:34.180 --> 50:36.180]  Half the people that work here got concealed carry
[50:36.180 --> 50:38.180]  I got a gun under the counter right here
[50:38.180 --> 50:40.180]  Underneath my broadcast studio
[50:40.180 --> 50:42.180]  357 Magnum
[50:42.180 --> 50:44.180]  357 Magnum
[50:44.180 --> 50:46.180]  I could have a even more high powered
[50:46.180 --> 50:48.180]  High capacity handgun, but I like the revolver
[50:48.180 --> 50:50.180]  7 shot 357
[50:50.180 --> 50:52.180]  Because it's a high powered
[50:52.180 --> 50:54.180]  Basically rifle round, high penetration
[50:54.180 --> 50:56.180]  High kill rate, I'm extremely accurate
[50:56.180 --> 50:58.180]  With it, I could shoot bullseye at 75 yards
[50:58.180 --> 51:00.180]  With it
[51:00.180 --> 51:02.180]  And it's not going to malfunction
[51:02.180 --> 51:04.180]  And it's right here
[51:04.180 --> 51:06.180]  And I've had one in my studio
[51:06.180 --> 51:08.180]  Since I broadcasted from my own studios
[51:08.180 --> 51:10.180]  Since
[51:10.180 --> 51:12.180]  1997
[51:14.180 --> 51:16.180]  And guess what, it hadn't
[51:16.180 --> 51:18.180]  Snuck out and killed anybody
[51:18.180 --> 51:20.180]  But we're not going to just sit here and get on our knees
[51:20.180 --> 51:22.180]  If somebody comes to our offices with a gun
[51:22.180 --> 51:24.180]  Wants to play games
[51:24.180 --> 51:26.180]  Somebody's got a gun waving around
[51:26.180 --> 51:28.180]  I'm going to
[51:28.180 --> 51:30.180]  Get to a knee
[51:30.180 --> 51:32.180]  Or get to cover and I'm going to not even think
[51:32.180 --> 51:34.180]  I'm going to shoot center of mass
[51:34.180 --> 51:36.180]  Until my gun is unloaded
[51:36.180 --> 51:38.180]  Real simple
[51:38.180 --> 51:40.180]  Real simple
[51:40.180 --> 51:42.180]  Because I'm a lover, not a fighter
[51:42.180 --> 51:44.180]  I'm not starting fights
[51:44.180 --> 51:46.180]  I don't want to shoot anybody, but I'm going to go home
[51:46.180 --> 51:48.180]  At the end of the day
[51:48.180 --> 51:50.180]  You know what, I don't fall
[51:50.180 --> 51:52.180]  Close in my car and I wear my seat belt
[51:52.180 --> 51:54.180]  Because I know every day that's what's dangerous
[51:54.180 --> 51:56.180]  In driving that truck
[51:56.180 --> 51:58.180]  Statistically it's a lot more dangerous than
[51:58.180 --> 52:00.180]  People with guns, hundreds of times more
[52:00.180 --> 52:02.180]  Honeybees are more dangerous than mass shootings
[52:02.180 --> 52:04.180]  Look it up
[52:04.180 --> 52:06.180]  So that's what I'm breaking down here today
[52:06.180 --> 52:08.180]  But the whole thing is
[52:08.180 --> 52:10.180]  Bizarre
[52:10.180 --> 52:12.180]  And I want to get your take on it
[52:12.180 --> 52:14.180]  But Elliott Rogers' parents warned police
[52:14.180 --> 52:16.180]  Weeks before mass shooting, every time
[52:16.180 --> 52:18.180]  You know, they say he's planning something
[52:18.180 --> 52:20.180]  He's planning something, nothing can be done
[52:20.180 --> 52:22.180]  And
[52:22.180 --> 52:24.180]  My issue is, hey, this is the way the world is
[52:24.180 --> 52:26.180]  There's always going to be bad, crazy people
[52:26.180 --> 52:28.180]  They got serial killers everywhere
[52:28.180 --> 52:30.180]  I want to know though
[52:30.180 --> 52:32.180]  If you disagree with me, how many leftists
[52:32.180 --> 52:34.180]  Do you know that are obsessed with serial killers
[52:34.180 --> 52:36.180]  Murder, death
[52:36.180 --> 52:38.180]  Think it's cute, think it's sexy
[52:38.180 --> 52:40.180]  Have death memorabilia everywhere
[52:40.180 --> 52:42.180]  And you know, they're on my website
[52:42.180 --> 52:44.180]  They're on infowars.com
[52:44.180 --> 52:46.180]  And the tweets, drugs picked it up
[52:46.180 --> 52:48.180]  You know, saying how sexy is
[52:48.180 --> 52:50.180]  Guys and girls, well they really think he's cool
[52:50.180 --> 52:52.180]  There's all these women that marry psychopaths
[52:52.180 --> 52:54.180]  Marry murderers, marry serial killers
[52:54.180 --> 52:56.180]  Marry child abusers while they're in prison
[52:56.180 --> 52:58.180]  I mean, there's a really sick society out there
[52:58.180 --> 53:00.180]  Now they've just revealed
[53:00.180 --> 53:02.180]  He was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome
[53:02.180 --> 53:04.180]  A form of autism
[53:04.180 --> 53:06.180]  He lived in a luxury California home
[53:06.180 --> 53:08.180]  Told us this was coming out just broke minutes ago
[53:08.180 --> 53:10.180]  With family and drove a BMW
[53:10.180 --> 53:12.180]  Grandmother was very disturbed
[53:12.180 --> 53:14.180]  And had mental health issues
[53:14.180 --> 53:16.180]  Guaranteed
[53:16.180 --> 53:18.180]  He was under psychiatric care
[53:18.180 --> 53:20.180]  I said that 40-something minutes ago
[53:20.180 --> 53:22.180]  When the show started, 50-something minutes ago
[53:22.180 --> 53:24.180]  I said it repeatedly this hour
[53:24.180 --> 53:26.180]  And they're going to seal his medical records
[53:26.180 --> 53:28.180]  I will bet you any amount of money
[53:28.180 --> 53:30.180]  That he's on money
[53:30.180 --> 53:32.180]  That he's on multiple serotonin reuptake inhibitors
[53:32.180 --> 53:34.180]  Or anti-psychotics
[53:34.180 --> 53:36.180]  Remember a few years ago
[53:36.180 --> 53:38.180]  There was a guy in a Walmart
[53:38.180 --> 53:40.180]  With no criminal record
[53:40.180 --> 53:42.180]  The people said he was walking around like a zombie
[53:42.180 --> 53:44.180]  With a handgun
[53:44.180 --> 53:46.180]  And the cop goes into confronting
[53:46.180 --> 53:48.180]  And the guy shoots him
[53:48.180 --> 53:50.180]  I mean, I'm not going to tell cops they're business
[53:50.180 --> 53:52.180]  But if I hear there's a guy walking around with a gun
[53:52.180 --> 53:54.180]  He's not even robbing a Walmart
[53:54.180 --> 53:56.180]  He's obviously out of his mind
[53:56.180 --> 53:58.180]  I'm going to not get in the view of this guy
[53:58.180 --> 54:00.180]  I mean, that's when you quite frankly
[54:00.180 --> 54:02.180]  Get behind somebody and say
[54:02.180 --> 54:04.180]  Drop your gun or I'm going to shoot
[54:04.180 --> 54:06.180]  And just shoot him right in the back
[54:06.180 --> 54:08.180]  The second they don't drop it
[54:08.180 --> 54:10.180]  Well, he killed that police officer
[54:10.180 --> 54:12.180]  Who responded, he was also a veteran
[54:12.180 --> 54:14.180]  Memorial Day come up tomorrow
[54:14.180 --> 54:16.180]  Terrible loss
[54:16.180 --> 54:18.180]  But the minute I heard it, I said
[54:18.180 --> 54:20.180]  He's going to be on some type of anti-psychotic
[54:20.180 --> 54:22.180]  And sure enough, he was on
[54:22.180 --> 54:24.180]  What was it?
[54:24.180 --> 54:26.180]  The sleeping pill that also makes the troops go crazy
[54:26.180 --> 54:28.180]  Ambien, yeah
[54:28.180 --> 54:30.180]  And they turned out one other deal and didn't even know who he was
[54:30.180 --> 54:32.180]  I mean, I'm no rocket scientist
[54:32.180 --> 54:34.180]  But when somebody with no criminal record
[54:34.180 --> 54:36.180]  Is walking around like a zombie
[54:36.180 --> 54:38.180]  And doesn't know who they are
[54:38.180 --> 54:40.180]  They're on drugs, folks
[54:40.180 --> 54:42.180]  And I bet you a lot of money this guy was on drugs
[54:42.180 --> 54:44.180]  Prozac type drugs
[54:44.180 --> 54:46.180]  Put you in a dream state, they're in the hallucinogen family
[54:46.180 --> 54:48.180]  They're psychotropic
[54:48.180 --> 54:50.180]  This guy probably thought
[54:50.180 --> 54:52.180]  He was American psycho
[54:52.180 --> 54:54.180]  So here I'm calling him
[54:54.180 --> 54:56.180]  All these names and saying he's a terrible person
[54:58.180 --> 55:00.180]  He is a spoiled brat punk
[55:00.180 --> 55:02.180]  But I don't know, let's just go to your calls
[55:02.180 --> 55:04.180]  I'm going to take a ton up in the next hour
[55:04.180 --> 55:06.180]  And get to so much other news
[55:06.180 --> 55:08.180]  It just really makes me want to throw up
[55:08.180 --> 55:10.180]  That as gun owners, we're being blamed
[55:10.180 --> 55:12.180]  As usual
[55:12.180 --> 55:14.180]  I'm sick of it, I haven't done anything
[55:14.180 --> 55:16.180]  And I'm tired of it
[55:16.180 --> 55:18.180]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ian in Santa Barbara
[55:18.180 --> 55:20.180]  Where this all happened, you're on the air
[55:20.180 --> 55:22.180]  Thanks for calling
[55:22.180 --> 55:24.180]  Hey, Alex
[55:24.180 --> 55:26.180]  I appreciate everything
[55:26.180 --> 55:28.180]  I'm calling in just to
[55:28.180 --> 55:30.180]  Give my two cents as a citizen in Santa Barbara
[55:30.180 --> 55:32.180]  Like I did an interview last year
[55:32.180 --> 55:34.180]  With Jakari about
[55:34.180 --> 55:36.180]  Actually, I was committed on a 5150
[55:36.180 --> 55:38.180]  For somebody
[55:38.180 --> 55:40.180]  My mom making up some things about me
[55:40.180 --> 55:42.180]  And it just kind of surprises me
[55:42.180 --> 55:44.180]  This kid wasn't taken away
[55:44.180 --> 55:46.180]  At the very least to
[55:46.180 --> 55:48.180]  Well, he had rich parents
[55:48.180 --> 55:50.180]  That's basically the conclusion
[55:50.180 --> 55:52.180]  I've reached is that because I'm poor
[55:52.180 --> 55:54.180]  And I don't have any family
[55:54.180 --> 55:56.180]  They just didn't want to touch this kid
[55:56.180 --> 55:58.180]  Because he's got a beamer
[55:58.180 --> 56:00.180]  And if you've got a beamer
[56:00.180 --> 56:02.180]  Into the cops, that's polite
[56:02.180 --> 56:04.180]  No, no, that's what the cops said
[56:04.180 --> 56:06.180]  He was polite to us
[56:06.180 --> 56:08.180]  He's polite because he's rich
[56:08.180 --> 56:10.180]  That's what I'm getting at
[56:10.180 --> 56:12.180]  At least here in town locally
[56:12.180 --> 56:14.180]  They live in here growing up here
[56:14.180 --> 56:16.180]  That's the attitude of the police
[56:16.180 --> 56:18.180]  They don't want any problems with lawyers
[56:18.180 --> 56:20.180]  Well, you know statistically
[56:20.180 --> 56:22.180]  It's true though that rich people
[56:22.180 --> 56:24.180]  Commit at least less retail
[56:24.180 --> 56:26.180]  Ground level fraud
[56:26.180 --> 56:28.180]  They commit more white-collar fraud
[56:28.180 --> 56:30.180]  But they just the police have learned
[56:30.180 --> 56:32.180]  To profile because quite frankly
[56:32.180 --> 56:34.180]  Usually it's accurate
[56:34.180 --> 56:36.180]  Usually a nerd in a BMW is not a threat
[56:36.180 --> 56:38.180]  Affluenza
[56:38.180 --> 56:40.180]  Affluenza is an issue
[56:40.180 --> 56:42.180]  No, in this narrow area
[56:42.180 --> 56:44.180]  In this very narrow spectrum
[56:44.180 --> 56:46.180]  This is the profile of these shooters
[56:46.180 --> 56:48.180]  A chicken-necked, weirdo, goth
[56:48.180 --> 56:50.180]  Devil-type, rich kid
[56:50.180 --> 56:52.180]  Obsessed with death
[56:52.180 --> 56:54.180]  Mad at girls
[56:54.180 --> 56:56.180]  Like Harrison Clybold
[56:56.180 --> 56:58.180]  Maybe that's why I'm so happy
[56:58.180 --> 57:00.180]  I mean, I'm not bragging
[57:00.180 --> 57:02.180]  Girls always love me
[57:02.180 --> 57:04.180]  I'm trying a red light
[57:04.180 --> 57:06.180]  Did what, brother?
[57:06.180 --> 57:08.180]  Earlier in the day
[57:08.180 --> 57:10.180]  I was coming back from Obipo
[57:10.180 --> 57:12.180]  On Friday afternoon and I saw him running a red light
[57:12.180 --> 57:14.180]  On his beamer
[57:14.180 --> 57:16.180]  I only remember because I thought to myself
[57:16.180 --> 57:18.180]  Who is this little punk
[57:18.180 --> 57:20.180]  He is running a red light
[57:20.180 --> 57:22.180]  Listen, I appreciate your call
[57:22.180 --> 57:24.180]  We're going to be right back
[57:24.180 --> 57:26.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, we shall return
[57:26.180 --> 57:28.180]  On the other side of this quick break
[57:28.180 --> 57:30.180]  And I'll try to cycle through more of your calls
[57:30.180 --> 57:32.180]  JD, Brian, Rob, Joseph
[57:32.180 --> 57:34.180]  Bill, Jesse
[57:34.180 --> 57:36.180]  Ronnie, Jerry, Peter
[57:36.180 --> 57:38.180]  Robin, Patricia
[57:38.180 --> 57:40.180]  Your calls are all coming up
[57:40.180 --> 57:42.180]  We haven't gotten to yet
[57:42.180 --> 57:44.180]  How dare them blame the Second Amendment
[57:44.180 --> 57:46.180]  And the right to self-defense
[57:46.180 --> 57:48.180]  Your right to self-defense is not a crime
[57:48.180 --> 57:50.180]  It's a right
[57:50.180 --> 57:52.180]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply
[57:52.180 --> 57:54.180]  In nine West Virginia counties
[57:54.180 --> 57:56.180]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia
[57:56.180 --> 57:58.180]  Had their drinking water contaminated
[57:58.180 --> 58:00.180]  What are the health effects
[58:00.180 --> 58:02.180]  Of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[58:02.180 --> 58:04.180]  It's forced medical treatment
[58:04.180 --> 58:06.180]  Without the consent of residents
[58:06.180 --> 58:08.180]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions
[58:08.180 --> 58:10.180]  You can take to protect you and your family
[58:10.180 --> 58:12.180]  From the harmful toxins and heavy metals
[58:12.180 --> 58:14.180]  In your tap water
[58:14.180 --> 58:16.180]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate
[58:16.180 --> 58:18.180]  At least once a week
[58:18.180 --> 58:20.180]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates
[58:20.180 --> 58:22.180]  That is found in water supplies worldwide
[58:22.180 --> 58:24.180]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines
[58:24.180 --> 58:26.180]  Hydrofluorosilic acid
[58:26.180 --> 58:28.180]  Sodium hexafluorosilicate
[58:28.180 --> 58:30.180]  Fluoride is in teats and coffins
[58:30.180 --> 58:32.180]  And breads and toothpaste
[58:32.180 --> 58:34.180]  It is our responsibility to protect our families
[58:34.180 --> 58:36.180]  The establishment is not going to do it
[58:36.180 --> 58:38.180]  It's a basic action
[58:38.180 --> 58:40.180]  It's time to filter our water
[58:40.180 --> 58:42.180]  Visit infowarstore.com
[58:42.180 --> 58:44.180]  And use promo code WATER
[58:44.180 --> 58:46.180]  To get 10% off their entire family
[58:46.180 --> 58:48.180]  Of incredible products

[58:50.180 --> 58:52.180]  888-253-3139
[58:52.180 --> 58:54.180]  Hi folks, Alex Jones
[58:54.180 --> 58:56.180]  Here with some important information
[58:56.180 --> 58:58.180]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk
[58:58.180 --> 59:00.180]  And his team of patriots over at my patriot supply
[59:00.180 --> 59:02.180]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment
[59:02.180 --> 59:04.180]  Frustrated with the direction this country was headed
[59:04.180 --> 59:06.180]  He's willing to sell us out for a quick buck
[59:06.180 --> 59:08.180]  Deciding to take action
[59:08.180 --> 59:10.180]  A company run by patriots for patriots was born
[59:10.180 --> 59:12.180]  My patriot supply
[59:12.180 --> 59:14.180]  Has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding
[59:14.180 --> 59:16.180]  They now operate two distribution facilities
[59:16.180 --> 59:18.180]  And employ
[59:18.180 --> 59:20.180]  Over 50 hardworking American men and women
[59:20.180 --> 59:22.180]  It is rare to find companies
[59:22.180 --> 59:24.180]  Who practice what they preach
[59:24.180 --> 59:26.180]  And that's why I stock my pantry
[59:26.180 --> 59:28.180]  With high quality storeable foods
[59:28.180 --> 59:30.180]  From my patriot supply

[59:38.180 --> 59:40.180]  At 866-229-0927
[59:40.180 --> 59:42.180]  That's 866-229-0927

[59:50.180 --> 59:52.180]  Coast to coast
[59:52.180 --> 59:54.180]  Direct from Austin
[59:54.180 --> 59:56.180]  You're listening to the
[59:56.180 --> 59:58.180]  Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[59:58.180 --> 01:00:00.180]  Network
[01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:02.180]  From his Central Texas Command Center
[01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:04.180]  Deep behind enemy lines
[01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:06.180]  The information war continues
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:08.180]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:10.180]  Radio Network
[01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:12.180]  Let's go right back to your phone calls
[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:14.180]  And move quickly through them
[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:16.180]  We're talking about the latest
[01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:18.180]  So-called mass shooting
[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:20.180]  Actually it was a stabbing
[01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:22.180]  Three dead from stabbing
[01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:24.180]  To me that's the big angle here
[01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:26.180]  Is that media ignores
[01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:28.180]  The fact that
[01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:30.180]  30 plus percent of the deaths
[01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:32.180]  In the latest rampage
[01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:34.180]  Were a knife
[01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:36.180]  Media ignores knife in
[01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:38.180]  Santa Barbara killings
[01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:40.180]  I mean that's the bottom line there
[01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:42.180]  Let's go ahead and talk to JD in California
[01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:44.180]  You're on the air, give us your take on this
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:46.180]  Hey Alex
[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:48.180]  Go ahead
[01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:50.180]  Yeah I just wanted to bring up
[01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:52.180]  Have you heard about the connection between
[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:54.180]  James Holmes' father
[01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:56.180]  Adam Lanz's father
[01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:58.180]  Executive Adam Lanz's was in
[01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:00.180]  GE and they're supposed to
[01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:02.180]  Testify in the LIBOR scandal
[01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:04.180]  Yes the fixing
[01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:06.180]  Of interest rates in Europe
[01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:08.180]  That is true
[01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:10.180]  And it's all very
[01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:12.180]  Creepy, I just don't know what we can draw from it
[01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:14.180]  How about all three
[01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:16.180]  Mass shootings have a big connection
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:18.180]  To the Hunger Games
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:20.180]  That's what I'm saying, you know
[01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:22.180]  All three of these had their fathers
[01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:24.180]  Or you know, lucky mucks
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:26.180]  I don't know
[01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:28.180]  You know coincidences happen
[01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:30.180]  I don't know, what do you think
[01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:32.180]  I don't know
[01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:34.180]  But let me tell you something real quick
[01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:36.180]  I've been trying to get on for a long time
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:38.180]  I got to tell you something about Star Wars
[01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:40.180]  Man, the Star Wars program, I got a direct connection
[01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:42.180]  To one of the surviving members
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:44.180]  And they're telling me stuff
[01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:46.180]  About sound harmonics and things like that
[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:48.180]  And wave technologies
[01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:50.180]  And they said that
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:52.180]  One of the first things they did was
[01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:54.180]  Working gills on a rabbit
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:56.180]  A full grown rabbit, they didn't have to work
[01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:58.180]  From fetus, you know, they put
[01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:00.180]  On a living adult rabbit
[01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:02.180]  With sound harmonics and wave technology
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:04.180]  They could put working gills
[01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:06.180]  On a rabbit in less than two weeks
[01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:10.180]  Well I know they've done a bunch of stuff
[01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:12.180]  With animals and dolphins and rabbits
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:14.180]  And all sorts of secretive stuff
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:16.180]  So I'd like to see the proof of that
[01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:18.180]  And not just a statement, they should go public
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:20.180]  And talk about it
[01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:22.180]  But he says he's been attacked by
[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:24.180]  You know, directed energy weapons
[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:26.180]  Yeah, there's also a lot of schizophrenics out there
[01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:28.180]  So just know
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:30.180]  This guy's a real member, bud
[01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:32.180]  Okay, well, I appreciate your call
[01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:34.180]  Now I hear you, I mean, my issue is
[01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:36.180]  For 30 years they've had human
[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:38.180]  Clones
[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:40.180]  That they killed the embryonic stage
[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:42.180]  It's in all the medical literature
[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:44.180]  No one seems to care
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:46.180]  They've had humanzies
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:48.180]  They say they have no rides because they're not a chimpanzee
[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:50.180]  They've had dogs that are part jellyfish
[01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:52.180]  Cats that are part jellyfish
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:54.180]  Goats that are part spider
[01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:56.180]  For 25 years
[01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:58.180]  Remote control cockroaches
[01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:00.180]  With brain chips 30 years ago
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:02.180]  I mean, I know that's all out there
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:04.180]  I just, there's so much
[01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:06.180]  Proven geoengineering weather modification
[01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:08.180]  That no one ever wants to hear about
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:10.180]  When it's like in the news
[01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:12.180]  And then it's just always somebody calling in saying
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:14.180]  Hey, I heard this or heard that
[01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:16.180]  But never giving a source or anything
[01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:18.180]  I'm not criticizing you
[01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:20.180]  I'm just saying
[01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:22.180]  I'm not saying you're full of bull
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:24.180]  It's just that it's like
[01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:26.180]  Emergency centers establishment acts
[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:28.180]  Is real
[01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:30.180]  The civilian MA labor camp program
[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:32.180]  Is real
[01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:34.180]  REX-84 operation garden plot
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:36.180]  Cable splicer
[01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:38.180]  Those are all the real FEMA camp plans
[01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:40.180]  That have been in the Miami Herald, you name it
[01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:42.180]  No one cares when I cover it
[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:44.180]  It's like it means nothing
[01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:46.180]  It's real and bonafide
[01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:48.180]  But if it's, I got a cousin who heard
[01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:50.180]  There's a FEMA camp, you know, out back
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:52.180]  The sports stadium and everybody runs around
[01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:54.180]  You know, oh my god, it's incredible
[01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:56.180]  I just, I don't understand it
[01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:58.180]  And I'm not saying that you're
[01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:00.180]  I mean, look, if somebody's already gone rogue
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:02.180]  From one of these secret programs
[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:04.180]  They might as well just tell it or they get killed
[01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:06.180]  You know, it's like there's some people that
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:08.180]  Oh, I know about the secret programs
[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:10.180]  You know, of putting gills on a rabbit
[01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:12.180]  With sound systems
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:14.180]  Technically, how does sound technology
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:16.180]  Put gills on a rabbit
[01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:18.180]  And then you said, well, they don't even do it
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:20.180]  Embryonically or they don't even genetically engineer it
[01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:22.180]  Well, that would be how you would want to do it
[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:24.180]  To have it work properly
[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:26.180]  So, I mean, I mean, maybe it's true
[01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:28.180]  I was just saying I'd like to
[01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:30.180]  See something to do, you know, to do with that
[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:32.180]  But again, the big topic
[01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:34.180]  We're covering here today
[01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:36.180]  Is three stabs
[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:38.180]  Four shot to death
[01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:40.180]  Why is the media not
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:42.180]  Making a big deal out of knives and banning them
[01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:44.180]  And should we all collectively
[01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:46.180]  Turn our knives into proof we're not bad people
[01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:48.180]  I'ma try to get to everybody
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:50.180]  Brian, Rob, Joseph, Bill, Jesse
[01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:52.180]  Ronnie, Jerry, Peter, Patricia
[01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:54.180]  And everybody, we're going to your call
[01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:56.180]  Straight ahead, the toll-free number to join us
[01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:58.180]  Got a couple open lines, it's 877-789-2539
[01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:00.180]  The globalists have controlled
[01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:02.180]  The mainstream media for a long time
[01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:04.180]  But now they're expanding
[01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:06.180]  Making the weaponization even more vicious
[01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:08.180]  And deceptive
[01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:10.180]  We are partnering this year with the NFL
[01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:12.180]  The NFL has become a political weapon
[01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:14.180]  Against the Second Amendment
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:16.180]  And pushes Obamacare
[01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:18.180]  MSNBC tells us that our children
[01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:20.180]  Belong to the state
[01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:22.180]  We have to break through our kind of private idea
[01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:24.180]  That kids belong to their parents
[01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:26.180]  Or kids belong to their families
[01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:28.180]  And recognize that kids belong to whole communities
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:30.180]  It is more important than ever to realize
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:32.180]  That we are not the alternative media
[01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:34.180]  We are the true media
[01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:36.180]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying
[01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:38.180]  We are in an information war
[01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:40.180]  And we are losing that war

[01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:24.180]  There is a war
[01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:26.180]  It's happening now
[01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:28.180]  It will decide the fate of humanity
[01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:30.180]  The time to choose sides has come
[01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:32.180]  We are the resistance
[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:40.180]  We are the info war

[01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:08.180]  Mountain
[01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:10.180]  Did you hear about
[01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:12.180]  Elliot Roger, the son of the hunger games
[01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:14.180]  Assistant director
[01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:16.180]  Who drove a brand new BMW
[01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:18.180]  And was under psychiatric care
[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:20.180]  I told you this in the first hour, last hour
[01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:22.180]  I said I bet money he was on
[01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:24.180]  Psychiatric drugs and mental care
[01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:26.180]  It's now being
[01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:28.180]  Reported by the Daily Mail
[01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:30.180]  He was under psychiatric care
[01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:32.180]  For, quote, ashburgers and other things
[01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:34.180]  Guaranteed on drugs
[01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:36.180]  Guaranteed
[01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:38.180]  Always the same
[01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:40.180]  But
[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:42.180]  Doesn't matter if the prozac family
[01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:44.180]  Of drugs and others say on the insert
[01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:46.180]  Can make you commit mass murder
[01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:48.180]  Megalomania, narcissistic
[01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:50.180]  Complete psychosis
[01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:52.180]  Doesn't matter if the inserts for
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:54.180]  Luvox and literally dozens of these
[01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:56.180]  Drugs all say the same thing
[01:07:56.180 --> 01:07:58.180]  Doesn't matter
[01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:00.180]  I will be blamed and CNN
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:02.180]  MSNBC
[01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:04.180]  Southern Poverty Law Center, the usual suspects
[01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:06.180]  And even some of the parents of the victims
[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:08.180]  Are now blaming the second amendment
[01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:10.180]  And saying how dare you, we've got to ban the guns
[01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:12.180]  The NRA are to blame
[01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:14.180]  You're craving, you're evil, I played the clips last hour
[01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:16.180]  Here's Richard Menendez, whose son was reportedly shot
[01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:18.180]  Our family has a message for every parent out there
[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:20.180]  You don't think it will happen to your child
[01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:22.180]  Until it does
[01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:24.180]  Well, yeah, more kids dying
[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:26.180]  Literally hundreds of times than by guns
[01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:28.180]  We ban cars
[01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:30.180]  If somebody kills somebody with a car, is it my fault
[01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:32.180]  Do I get blamed?
[01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:34.180]  Why did Chris die?
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:36.180]  Chris died because of Craven, irresponsible politicians
[01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:38.180]  And the NRA
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:40.180]  They talk about gun rights, what about Chris's right to live?
[01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:42.180]  But what about my right to not be blamed
[01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:44.180]  For your son's death?
[01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:46.180]  Again, I'm sorry for your loss
[01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:48.180]  But I didn't do it in this politically correct world
[01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:50.180]  Okay, there's lower crime
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:52.180]  In areas with more guns, in good people's hands
[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:54.180]  Seven people died
[01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:56.180]  Three of them were stabbed to death, the police say
[01:08:58.180 --> 01:09:00.180]  What is that?
[01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:02.180]  40%?
[01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:04.180]  What's the exact math, guys?
[01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:06.180]  Do the, uh, divide that
[01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:08.180]  What percentage is three out of seven?
[01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:10.180]  I know it's a fraction
[01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:12.180]  Is it like
[01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:14.180]  37% or something?
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:16.180]  Look it up for me
[01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:18.180]  I didn't do good math in school, plus I can't
[01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:20.180]  You know, walk and chew gum or broadcast and do math
[01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:22.180]  But we're talking close to 40%
[01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:24.180]  Of them were killed with a knife
[01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:26.180]  And you're not hearing anything about that
[01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:28.180]  It's all guns, guns
[01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:30.180]  Everybody who has knives out there, I'll tell you what
[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:32.180]  If you want to blame guns for this
[01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:34.180]  And you're an anti-gun person
[01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:36.180]  42%, okay
[01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:38.180]  So it was, okay
[01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:40.180]  So 42%
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:42.180]  Three out of seven
[01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:44.180]  Is 42%
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.180]  See, I was just estimating lows
[01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:48.180]  I don't want to exaggerate
[01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:50.180]  42%, that's the headline
[01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:52.180]  42%
[01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:56.180]  Of the California people killed in the massacre
[01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:00.180]  Knives killed 40%
[01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:02.180]  In California massacre
[01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:04.180]  And so if you will come turn in all your guns
[01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:08.180]  And all your knives
[01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:10.180]  And anything sharp in your house
[01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:12.180]  And baseball bats
[01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:14.180]  And golf clubs, they kill thousands a year
[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:16.180]  I want it all banned
[01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:18.180]  I want everything
[01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:20.180]  I want your fist banned, they kill thousands of years
[01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:22.180]  Chop your hands off
[01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:24.180]  Turn in all your knives
[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:26.180]  And then I'll say, you know what, I'll turn my guns in
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:28.180]  That's how asinine all this is
[01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:30.180]  I want to take your phone calls on this subject
[01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:32.180]  Are you going to take the blame for this, America?
[01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:34.180]  Or are you sick of it?
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:36.180]  Let's talk to Brian and El Paso
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:38.180]  Go ahead
[01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:40.180]  Go ahead, please
[01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:42.180]  Yeah, Alex, I just wanted to tell you how much I
[01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:44.180]  Agree with you
[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:46.180]  The individuals that proficient in the use of a weapon
[01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:48.180]  Are the only chance
[01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:50.180]  For this thing to stop
[01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:52.180]  It's the only way you can prevent mass shootings
[01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:54.180]  That's been shown over and over again
[01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:56.180]  I was a federal agent for 13 years
[01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:58.180]  After separating from the military
[01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:00.180]  Working in the so called drug war
[01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:02.180]  And I
[01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:04.180]  Re-stacked conclusion that, you know
[01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:06.180]  Legalization, taxation of drugs
[01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:08.180]  Was the way to go
[01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:10.180]  And my whole thing with this was I always tell people
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:12.180]  I tell individuals when I get into this discussion
[01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:14.180]  About firearms, I say, even if you don't
[01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:20.020]  believe, and that the ultimate necessity for the people to have weapons to be able to take
[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:25.260]  control back from an out of control, tyrannical government, even if you don't believe that.
[01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:26.260]  Think about this for one minute.
[01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:28.860]  I worked in the drug war, okay?
[01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:33.620]  There was no way we were able to stop, even without talking about the government's involvement
[01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:35.860]  thanks to governments doing moving drugs themselves.
[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:40.940]  There was no way we could stop the rogue organization that were bringing the amount of drugs into
[01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:41.940]  the United States that they were.
[01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:44.420]  Because by making it illegal, it jacked up the price.
[01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:48.740]  Well, yeah, of course, they're making money on it, but the whole point on this discussion
[01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:53.860]  with regards to the weapons, if we outlawed the sale, the manufacture, possession, transfer
[01:11:53.860 --> 01:12:00.100]  of all weapons by civilian populace, right now today, there would be a black market that
[01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:03.980]  would spring up overnight, and I'm not talking about the one our government wants, I'm talking
[01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:05.460]  about other ones for profit.
[01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:06.460]  No, no, exactly.
[01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:10.980]  England could ban guns, and their crime rate went up tenfold when they did over the last
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:13.660]  20 years, but you're right, they never had a gun culture.
[01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:19.140]  You got 400 plus million new manufactured guns since 1950, estimated in the country.
[01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:21.340]  You're never getting rid of them.
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:22.340]  That's exactly right.
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:26.100]  And it's the whole thing when you get down to that point, you realize, look, the guns
[01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:31.540]  are going to be in the hands, and by definition, if we outlaw the possession of guns, then
[01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:34.220]  the only people that are gonna have those guns are who?
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:36.220]  People who are outside the law.
[01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:37.220]  What do you make of this guy?
[01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:41.260]  I mean, I bet money, he reportedly drove around for like 30-minute shooting people.
[01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:46.740]  I bet money, if he did this in El Paso or in Dallas, Texas, within 10 minutes, a concealed
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:49.900]  carry would have killed him, you know, the cops got there because they had guns, good
[01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:52.700]  job for them, but I mean, what, 10 minutes?
[01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:54.940]  He went around reportedly for 30-minute shooting people.
[01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:56.940]  10's on the high side.
[01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:59.380]  I'd give him about five to seven.
[01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:00.380]  Yeah.
[01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:07.540]  If he was anywhere in my neighborhood, I'd give him 30 seconds.
[01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:10.500]  Well, that happens all the time in high gun ownership areas.
[01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:14.260]  You'll have the police in a shootout, and then somebody will just shoot the guy shooting
[01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:17.380]  at the cops from behind for the police.
[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:19.980]  That happens all every week, but you never hear about it.
[01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:20.980]  Absolutely.
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:21.980]  You never hear about it.
[01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:26.620]  Well, this whole thing, Alex, this guy, he's obviously, as you say, he's disturbed on a
[01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:28.140]  whole bunch of levels.
[01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:32.580]  But the truth of the matter is, when you see this little dweeb, and I can imagine what
[01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:38.620]  this was with this guy, you know, he's talking about, oh, I'm supposed to be having sex with
[01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:39.620]  women.
[01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:41.220]  It wasn't a woman.
[01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:46.100]  This wasn't about, oh, he was crazy about this one woman, and that's who his heart was
[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:47.100]  with.
[01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:48.980]  No, it was just about, oh, it's a rite of passage.
[01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:50.260]  I'm supposed to be in college.
[01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:51.260]  I'm supposed to be just kidding.
[01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:56.660]  No, he was a spoiled brat that saw women as objects or possessions and would say, I walk
[01:13:56.660 --> 01:14:02.220]  up to do sexual acts, and they don't want it, because you're, because exactly, I mean,
[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:03.220]  what about his parents?
[01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:05.220]  I mean, they obviously didn't teach him anything.
[01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:08.460]  I mean, I don't want to blame his parents, but it's pretty sick.
[01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:09.460]  It is sick.
[01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:13.540]  And it's almost to the level of you look at somebody saying, and when I, when I was watching
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:18.740]  this YouTube video that you put up on your show, and I'm seeing this little kid, and
[01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:24.220]  it dweeb, whatever, they twerp, he's sitting in this car and saying, he is going to be
[01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:26.100]  a God.
[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:29.900]  When I hear that, first of all, what goes into my mind right off the bat, I'm going,
[01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:34.380]  there's nobody saying that kind of thing to my way of thinking, they're blasphemy.
[01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:35.380]  That's what that is.
[01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:36.380]  Okay.
[01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:38.380]  Well, they're on a power trip completely out of his mind.
[01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:39.380]  Satan, man.
[01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:41.340]  It comes from Satan, okay?
[01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:42.340]  And that's what that's about.
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:43.340]  No, you're right.
[01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:44.340]  He was like possessed.
[01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:46.100]  I mean, he was saying, I'm God, I'm God.
[01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:47.100]  Who thinks like that?
[01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:48.860]  I could play a bunch of clips of the elite.
[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:49.860]  That's about it.
[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:50.860]  Great, great points.
[01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:51.860]  We're going to come back and go to a bunch of calls now.
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:54.820]  That was a great caller right there, but Rob, everybody get ready and come back to
[01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:55.820]  you.
[01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:56.820]  I'll pass.
[01:14:56.820 --> 01:15:00.300]  So by the way, I had heard yesterday in this morning that the cops had shot him.
[01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:01.820]  Now they're saying he killed himself.
[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:04.820]  I mean, just again, total cowardice.
[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:06.460]  Who knows what the truth is?
[01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:09.460]  The point is I have guns.
[01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:12.700]  I don't like a screwdriver in the drawer, folks.
[01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:14.460]  It's not like I'm even obsessed with them.
[01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:16.860]  I have them because I'm not a victim.
[01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:18.980]  I don't want to be a victim.
[01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:23.900]  And if somebody, especially somebody in media, you know, but people get stalked, people get
[01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:27.340]  attacked, a lot of talk shows have been shot in this country, three or four just the last
[01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:28.340]  few decades.
[01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:29.340]  They've made movies about it.
[01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:30.340]  I'm not going to be another victim.
[01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:35.140]  And I look at most of these media operations, they don't let anybody have to still carry
[01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:36.140]  in the building.
[01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:39.420]  They don't let anybody, you know, protect themselves.
[01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:41.260]  A killer is going to come with a gun anyways.
[01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:45.620]  You might as well have people that have got the guns legally and lawfully to protect yourself.
[01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:48.900]  All right, we're going to come back and continue this discussion straight ahead.
[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:57.140]  Bottom line, 42% of those killed were killed by knives in this latest mass killing.
[01:15:57.140 --> 01:16:00.460]  By the way, he killed himself, so it's more than half.
[01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:02.820]  This is Scotty's John for infowars.com.
[01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:07.220]  I know that most of you here in this commercial already know about the New World Order, eugenics
[01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:09.580]  and all the other issues covered here at InfoWars.
[01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:12.380]  The question is, do your friends and family know?
[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:14.020]  If not, then I want to know why.
[01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:16.580]  Oh, I know it's tough to talk about this with some people.
[01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:17.580]  They might call you names.
[01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:20.940]  Or they just want to talk about sports are so populist.
[01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:21.940]  I say so what?
[01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:24.460]  There's a battle going on out there right now.
[01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:27.860]  The ammunition is information and the soldiers are you.
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:32.100]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant.
[01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:36.020]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand
[01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:37.020]  years.
[01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:38.020]  And I'm still fighting.
[01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:41.180]  If we don't all stand up right now, we're going to lose everything.
[01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:43.060]  The Info War is worldwide.
[01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:47.340]  Tell your friends about InfoWars and let them know that InfoWars doesn't print bull.
[01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:51.060]  It's real journalism and news backed up by documented fact.
[01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:58.300]  Step up and take your friends and family to infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv and planetinfowars.com.
[01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:00.340]  The truth will set them free.
[01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:05.060]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care?
[01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:08.100]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:13.660]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism and every other major disease?
[01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:15.620]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:17.260]  We are what we eat.
[01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:21.900]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:26.140]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:28.700]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:31.340]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist.
[01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:34.900]  By giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.
[01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:37.900]  To learn more visit InfowarsHealth.com.

[01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:44.940]  don't bow down to big pharma.
[01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:49.220]  The fight against the new world order starts with you and you can't stand against the machine
[01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:51.060]  of your sick, tired and obese.

[01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:05.660]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more
[01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:09.700]  toxic each and every day but it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:13.780]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants
[01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:19.180]  than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals
[01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:20.180]  within their homes.
[01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:23.580]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:28.100]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget
[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:31.700]  the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:36.220]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:41.220]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight
[01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:46.500]  back against made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:50.900]  The new InfowarsLife Lung Cleans is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought
[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:53.020]  with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:18:53.020 --> 01:19:00.100]  Now available exclusively at InfowarsLife.com or by calling toll 3-888-2533139.

[01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:07.820]  The latest in preparedness is now here, an electrically stabilized colloidal sulfur solution
[01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:12.140]  that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:16.500]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the Survival Silver Solution.
[01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:21.260]  The new InfowarsLife Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver is the answer for you and your family
[01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:26.220]  and it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:31.060]  The InfowarsLife Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a two
[01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:34.900]  ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:37.020]  This is not a low grade formula.
[01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:41.580]  You're working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring
[01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:47.500]  you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of DINI's

[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:05.020]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:09.020]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:37.020]  What is a PsyOp?
[01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:42.660]  Well, it's a psychological operation and the so-called mainstream media, the state-run
[01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:44.060]  media is a shadow of itself.
[01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:47.980]  I've got some statistics on that that just broke coming up in the next segment, but I'm
[01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:50.500]  going to go right back to your calls right now.
[01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:55.180]  The PsyOp, though, is to blame gun owners for this and, by the way, I misspoke because
[01:20:55.180 --> 01:20:59.580]  I had thought the police had killed this guy because they'd been saying that earlier that
[01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:01.420]  he died when police had confronted him.
[01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:05.260]  So I guess like a coward, they confronted him and then he killed himself, so in a way,
[01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:09.380]  he did get killed when the police confronted him, so I guess that's true partly.
[01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:12.500]  But now they know, and they're saying, I have the article right here, that they think he
[01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:13.500]  killed himself.
[01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:17.580]  Maybe they just don't want to be sued, they're just saying that, who knows?
[01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:20.380]  Who blames them, you know, by the laws which are nowadays?
[01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:28.220]  The point is that now three were killed with knives, the Sheriff's Department's confirmed,
[01:21:28.220 --> 01:21:33.980]  the first people he killed in a frat house were people with knives.
[01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:36.820]  He killed them with knives, a knife.
[01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:42.220]  And then three people he killed with a gun, and then the seventh was himself.
[01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:48.300]  So 50% of the people killed in the Santa Barbara massacre, as the media is calling it, were
[01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:49.300]  killed with knives.
[01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:54.340]  Half of them with knives, no discussion of that.
[01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:58.380]  I mean, if people weren't armed folks, I could kill, you could kill multiple people with
[01:21:58.380 --> 01:21:59.380]  a hammer.
[01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:00.380]  You gonna ban hammers?
[01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:04.900]  I know a lot of World War II vets that were in the European theater and they would sneak
[01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:08.940]  up at the checkpoints in the trench warfare that went on in the Battle of the Bulls and
[01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:13.580]  stuff where the lines all crossed over each other and you'd use a big ball peen hammer.
[01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:17.940]  In fact, they were shipping them in and pretty much issuing them to people because you would
[01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:22.780]  walk up to somebody when they were in a foxhole and kill them with a ball peen hammer because
[01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:27.340]  then you'd whack them over the head with a ball peen hammer or a baseball bat, but ball
[01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:29.860]  peen hammers were better.
[01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:33.580]  That's accurate in the glorious bastards where they're using baseball bats to kill people
[01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:38.180]  because that's what you want to use if you don't want to alert the guys 50 yards away
[01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:41.140]  in a machine gun nest, you just club somebody's brains out.
[01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:47.700]  I mean, you're never going to stop people that want to kill.
[01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:49.500]  And I keep harping on that.
[01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:51.620]  I'm sick of being blamed for this stuff.
[01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:53.700]  So there's the big media hoax.
[01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:55.020]  They're blaming guns.
[01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:58.260]  Half the people killed because we don't count him.
[01:22:58.260 --> 01:23:02.020]  We're killed with knives, with a knife.
[01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:03.020]  That's big.
[01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:04.300]  That's big news.
[01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:08.620]  Let's go ahead and go to Joseph in Greensboro, North Carolina, then Rob and others.
[01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:10.860]  Joseph, you're on the air.
[01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:11.860]  Welcome.
[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:12.860]  All right.
[01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:13.860]  I'm doing good.
[01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:14.860]  I guess you're not there, Joseph.
[01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:18.300]  I just want, I'm used to be a reporter for a daily newspaper.
[01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:25.260]  I've got some interest in this and you have people, you have reporters and resources.
[01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:31.060]  Why don't you take up and do some actual reporting on this that the news media won't do?
[01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:34.980]  For instance, find out who this kid was.
[01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:39.980]  Find out if the kid in the video was actually the kid who was killed.
[01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:43.420]  Find out if the car he was in was actually his car.
[01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:50.740]  I watched the video and the video sounds to me like bad acting, that they've hired another
[01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:56.340]  Hollywood person, like did it at Sandy Hook, who is basically giving bad acting.
[01:23:56.340 --> 01:24:00.780]  Now, for instance, he says, I'm a virgin.
[01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:08.900]  Now, what 22-year-old, no matter how mentally ill he is, do you know who would put on tape
[01:24:08.900 --> 01:24:10.900]  to the whole world, hey, look at me.
[01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:12.540]  I'm a virgin.
[01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:17.540]  Now, how does somebody get through college these days without getting late?
[01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:18.540]  It's just incredible.
[01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:19.540]  I hear you.
[01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:26.100]  Secondly, the person who supposedly is his father, I find that very suspicious also because
[01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:27.100]  I can't imagine.
[01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:34.700]  Hold on a minute, you're making great points, Joseph, but let me just be clear for a moment.
[01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:39.540]  We only have six reporters, two of them already live in England.
[01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:43.620]  I'm sending a reporter and a camera guy to Bilderberg this next week to cover that.
[01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:45.700]  Then we have the Nightly News reporters.
[01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:47.540]  We don't have the staff.
[01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:49.020]  We probably have one reporter.
[01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:52.340]  We can send staff, Sergeant Joe Biggs, out there, and I was already thinking about it,
[01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:54.220]  but this just happened yesterday.
[01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:56.620]  Even national radio hosts don't work on Sundays.
[01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:57.620]  I do.
[01:24:57.620 --> 01:25:02.780]  So I'm not minding ideas, but we're working as hard as we can around here, believe me.
[01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:03.780]  We've got a skeleton crew.
[01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:06.700]  A lot of folks are on vacation for Memorial Day.
[01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:08.620]  But I hear you.
[01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:11.380]  This thing stinks, and Sandy Hook was staged.
[01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:14.380]  We've had state police investigators, others on.
[01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:15.620]  They had blue screens.
[01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:16.620]  It's fake.
[01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:18.100]  We don't know what happened.
[01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:20.020]  We just know the official story isn't true.
[01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:24.900]  We're going to get Wolfgang Halbic and others back on this week, breaking this down.
[01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:25.900]  But I hear you.
[01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:27.220]  What about citizen journalists?
[01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:30.900]  You know, folks, you go out there and do it because I can't get it all done, but great
[01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:31.900]  points.
[01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:32.900]  I appreciate your call.
[01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:33.900]  Got to move quick now.
[01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:35.700]  Ronnie in Texas, then Bill and others.
[01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:38.700]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Bill.
[01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:39.700]  Hey, guys.
[01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:40.700]  You're in Florida.
[01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:41.700]  How you doing?
[01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:42.700]  Good.
[01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:43.700]  Good.
[01:25:43.700 --> 01:25:44.700]  Go ahead.
[01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:45.700]  Then we'll go to Ronnie.
[01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:46.700]  Go ahead.
[01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:48.700]  Hey, I was watching the news clip today and they interviewed one of the people who was
[01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:49.700]  an eyewitness.
[01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:55.700]  And the gentleman's name was actually on my plea broom at the neighbor academy.
[01:25:55.700 --> 01:25:56.700]  Same name.
[01:25:56.700 --> 01:25:59.580]  I called him up and I said, I couldn't believe it.
[01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:05.660]  And the individual said that he thought that he saw two people in the BMW.
[01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:07.660]  And that seems extremely odd.
[01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:10.660]  Now, I did go to the academy, the neighborhood academy.
[01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:11.660]  I was a newbie diver.
[01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:15.660]  I went through extensive training, judo, hand-to-hand combat.
[01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:20.660]  And that guy, without being too derogatory, looked extremely metrosexual.
[01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:24.660]  I can't fathom him sticking a knife into somebody and killing them.
[01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:26.660]  You have to go through weeks and weeks.
[01:26:26.660 --> 01:26:31.660]  Well, I was about to say, I was about to say, I'm no military guy, but I grew up saw a lot
[01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:32.660]  of rough stuff in Dallas.
[01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:34.660]  It takes a lot to really stab somebody.
[01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:38.660]  I mean, I had somebody stab me once and they tried and it barely even went into my thigh.
[01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:40.660]  And the guy stabbed me pretty hard.
[01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:41.660]  Muscles tough.
[01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:42.660]  I agree with you.
[01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:44.660]  It takes a lot of training to butcher somebody properly.
[01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:46.660]  None of it makes sense.
[01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:50.660]  But you're saying you called your buddy and who you saw in the news was a witness.
[01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:52.660]  And he said he thought he saw two people in the car?
[01:26:52.660 --> 01:26:54.660]  No, there's the same name as my buddy.
[01:26:54.660 --> 01:26:55.660]  It was the same name.
[01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:56.660]  Okay, I misunderstood.
[01:26:56.660 --> 01:27:01.660]  The same name, but I just couldn't believe the coincidence with the Hunger Games.
[01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:07.660]  And to kill somebody silently, if you got three people who were living as roommates, that's bull.
[01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:11.660]  Well, I was about to say, even wimps will fight for their life.
[01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:15.660]  I mean, I find it hard to believe that he killed three guys with a knife.
[01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:16.660]  What did you do?
[01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:20.660]  Hit them home to tell everyone they were asleep?
[01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:22.660]  It doesn't make sense.
[01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:24.660]  It takes a lot of will to kill somebody with a knife.
[01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:26.660]  That's what I agree with you.
[01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:28.660]  Well, what do you think, Dan, a Psyop?
[01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:29.660]  What do you think this is?
[01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:35.660]  It doesn't look strong enough to beat his meat.
[01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:36.660]  I hear you.
[01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:37.660]  I hear you.
[01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:38.660]  I appreciate your call.
[01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:39.660]  Wow.
[01:27:39.660 --> 01:27:40.660]  Good points.
[01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:41.660]  Let's go to Ronnie in Texas real quick.
[01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:42.660]  Ronnie, go ahead.
[01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:43.660]  Thank you.
[01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:50.660]  Yeah, the psycho, seemingly shameless, sociopathic, stabbing butcher man.
[01:27:50.660 --> 01:27:52.660]  We need to stick on that point.
[01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:53.660]  It's not a gunman.
[01:27:53.660 --> 01:27:55.660]  He's a stabbing butcher man.
[01:27:55.660 --> 01:28:01.660]  Like you're saying, it's so graphic and the violence involved to kill somebody with a knife.
[01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:05.660]  It's just really very intense.
[01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:10.660]  The only way it's easy is with an ice pick, but you don't die right away.
[01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:13.660]  You got a stab somewhere like five or six times to make sure you get them.
[01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:16.660]  I mean, other than an ice pick, I don't know how he would do that.
[01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:17.660]  Go ahead.
[01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:23.660]  Yeah, he's obviously been programmed to clearly manipulate it just like searing and searing.
[01:28:23.660 --> 01:28:30.660]  And obviously, I think, financed by the same cabal of criminals, these enemies of our nation's
[01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:34.660]  liberty, I'm sorry to say, they're numerous and sadly effective.
[01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:35.660]  Now, I hear you, Ronnie.
[01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:40.660]  Thanks for calling Jerry, Peter, Sherry, Patricia, Chris, Dennis, everybody, your calls are coming
[01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:46.660]  up, toll free number to join us, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:50.660]  Bottom line, I'm not taking the blame for this as a gun owner.
[01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:53.660]  My guns make people safe.
[01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:56.660]  And knife owners shouldn't take the blame either.
[01:28:56.660 --> 01:28:58.660]  And baseball, that owner shouldn't take the blame.
[01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:00.660]  The criminal takes the blame.
[01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:01.660]  I don't know what it is.
[01:29:01.660 --> 01:29:03.660]  Ralph just won't pay any attention to me.
[01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:07.660]  When he comes home from work, all he ever does is play video games and go to sleep.
[01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:08.660]  Just like I don't even exist.
[01:29:08.660 --> 01:29:10.660]  Oh, Betty, that's just awful.
[01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:12.660]  Does this seem familiar?
[01:29:12.660 --> 01:29:15.660]  If the answer to this question is yes, then listen carefully.
[01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:19.660]  Toxic pesticides, GMO foods and additives, BPA plastics, contaminated water supplies,
[01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:24.660]  many of these toxic additives are deliberately engineered to attack and weaken human masculinity.
[01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:27.660]  It's part of the eugenics population control movement.
[01:29:27.660 --> 01:29:28.660]  Look it up.
[01:29:28.660 --> 01:29:32.660]  If men are more interested in online gaming than they are in their wives,
[01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:35.660]  a serious population crisis is soon to follow.

[01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:06.660]  The football, the basketball.
[01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:08.660]  Alert, security, alert.
[01:30:08.660 --> 01:30:10.660]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:13.660]  Analysis, info wars, building independence, media operation.
[01:30:13.660 --> 01:30:18.660]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:21.660]  Prime-directed discredit Alex Jones.
[01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:24.660]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:27.660]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Info Wars.
[01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:31.660]  I don't know what he is except a conspiracy theory.
[01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:34.660]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:36.660]  They are never going to stop.
[01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:40.660]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:52.660]  You got to set your eye on the enemy.
[01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:55.660]  Not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:30:55.660 --> 01:30:58.660]  Electrally, it's begun. You can fail it.
[01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:03.660]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:31:03.660 --> 01:31:07.660]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:11.660]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:31:11.660 --> 01:31:14.660]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:19.660]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family
[01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:22.660]  from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:31:22.660 --> 01:31:26.660]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:31:26.660 --> 01:31:30.660]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:36.660]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:31:36.660 --> 01:31:40.660]  All right, it is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in breads, it's in toothpaste.
[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:43.660]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:44.660]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:31:44.660 --> 01:31:47.660]  It's time to take action. It's time to filter our water.

[01:32:25.660 --> 01:32:31.660]  The infowarstlife silver bullet silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle
[01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:34.660]  and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:36.660]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:40.660]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States
[01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:45.660]  to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes
[01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:49.660]  within a base of deionized water for your preparedness storage.

[01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:38.660]  We're talking about the latest attempted guilt trip by the state-run media
[01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:41.660]  to blame gun owners for what's happened.
[01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:45.660]  Half the people that died, if you don't count the reported shooter,
[01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:55.660]  Elliot Roger, the spoiled evil brat under psychiatric care with a Hunger Games director dad,
[01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:59.660]  50% of those killed were reportedly killed with a knife.
[01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:05.660]  And you would think this is the only thing happening in the world right now.
[01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:10.660]  They're going to all week call for our guns every time some crazy person shoots somebody.
[01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:15.660]  Fort Hood, military, trained with guns, killed some people.
[01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:18.660]  It's a gun-free zone with the military, though.
[01:34:18.660 --> 01:34:21.660]  So we can't have trips with guns now?
[01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:24.660]  Dorner was a cop. He ran around shooting cops.
[01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:26.660]  You going to take guns from cops?
[01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:31.660]  No, you don't blame a group of people for what one person does.
[01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:35.660]  When a cop does something bad, we don't blame all the police. We shouldn't.
[01:34:35.660 --> 01:34:39.660]  I mean, if a cowboy goes out and does something wrong, we blame all cowboys.
[01:34:39.660 --> 01:34:44.660]  Do we blame all Native Americans if one Native American does something?
[01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:46.660]  Do we blame all women?
[01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:52.660]  We should reject the authoritarian idea that everyone's guilty for what someone else does.
[01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:56.660]  That's out of the Soviet Union, where if your neighbor does something wrong, you get punished, too.
[01:34:56.660 --> 01:35:02.660]  I reject authoritarianism, and I reject communal guilt.
[01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:08.660]  I will pay for what I've done, and by the way, I will achieve for what I've done.
[01:35:08.660 --> 01:35:11.660]  See, I want to stand on my merits, like Martin Luther King said.
[01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:17.660]  Judge people by what they do, what they stand for, not what color they are.
[01:35:17.660 --> 01:35:19.660]  I'm ranting. I know. Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:22.660]  Who's up next? Jerry in Georgia, then Peter and others.
[01:35:22.660 --> 01:35:25.660]  Go ahead, and we're going to get to everybody. Patricia and Sherry are up next.
[01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:27.660]  Go ahead, Jerry.
[01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:29.660]  Hi, Alex. Thank you for taking my call.
[01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:35.660]  This isn't my point. This just came up on CNN, and it completely ties in with what you were saying.
[01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:40.660]  I'll get to my point, but they're saying that when the mother saw his YouTube videos in April,
[01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:44.660]  she called one of his therapists, multiple therapists.
[01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:48.660]  He's being treated by multiple mental health professionals
[01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:52.660]  who then called a mental health hotline, who then called a sheriff.
[01:35:52.660 --> 01:35:55.660]  He was office broker.
[01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:59.660]  My point is, the person we need to blame, the people we need to blame are the parents
[01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:02.660]  and they need to be charged with negligent homicide.
[01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:06.660]  They knew in April that he was suicidal and homicide.
[01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:10.660]  Oh, yeah. I mean, if one of my kids was going around talking about shooting and killing people,
[01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:13.660]  I mean, I would get them help and lock them up till they were better.
[01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:15.660]  I mean, it's undoubted. It's incredible.
[01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:20.660]  They didn't cut off the BMW. They didn't cut off the money.
[01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:22.660]  They didn't even go check on him.
[01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:26.660]  I bet you this guy never even got disciplined in any way.
[01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:31.660]  Alex, my point is if you charge the parents right now with negligent homicide,
[01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:36.660]  they legally can't destroy any emails that he sent them.
[01:36:36.660 --> 01:36:40.660]  They can't destroy any receipts because if they bought his handgun
[01:36:40.660 --> 01:36:45.660]  or if that handgun belonged to daddy and they knew he had that weapon
[01:36:45.660 --> 01:36:50.660]  and did not put him in for three days of mental health observation,
[01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:52.660]  they are negligently resorted.
[01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:54.660]  Sure. No, I agree with you.
[01:36:54.660 --> 01:36:56.660]  And the guys just pulled it up. It is true now.
[01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:59.660]  They say he has multiple therapists.
[01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:03.660]  The issue here is, though, the police were told to,
[01:37:03.660 --> 01:37:05.660]  so they're negligent if this is true.
[01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:07.660]  That's why you're going to see a cover up.
[01:37:07.660 --> 01:37:09.660]  I appreciate your call. Very interesting point, Jerry. Great point.
[01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:12.660]  What was your other point about the parents' fault?
[01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:17.660]  Yes, it's the parents' fault and directing it towards them.
[01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:20.660]  It's not comfortable doing that because they're grieving,
[01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:25.660]  but directing it towards them is where the guilt needs to go,
[01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:29.660]  not the guns. It's the parents.
[01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:32.660]  And they're non-touch hands-off parenting.
[01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:35.660]  They didn't touch their kids for the past month.
[01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:39.660]  Well, Jerry, I know whose fault it is, and it's not your fault.
[01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:41.660]  It's not Jerry and George's fault.
[01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:43.660]  It's not Peter and Las Vegas' fault.
[01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:45.660]  It's not Sherry and Fredericksburg, Texas' fault.
[01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:48.660]  It's not Patricia and Arizona's fault.
[01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:52.660]  It's that individual's fault and his parents' fault,
[01:37:52.660 --> 01:37:56.660]  and I will not take the blame. Obama and Southern Poverty Laws
[01:37:56.660 --> 01:37:59.660]  are in the rest of you. They won't take the blame for fast and furious.
[01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:02.660]  They ship those guns to Mexico to blame the Second Amendment.
[01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:04.660]  They're not getting in trouble. I'm not getting in trouble.
[01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:08.660]  I didn't do Jack Squat. I appreciate your call.
[01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:11.660]  Peter and Las Vegas, shirt on the air. Go ahead.
[01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:15.660]  Hi. I clearly lay the blame with the father
[01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:19.660]  and that whole demonic Hollywood crowd.
[01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:24.660]  Look, what is Hunger Games? It's about kids killing kids to survive.
[01:38:24.660 --> 01:38:30.660]  That whole kind of procedure is why, for example,
[01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:38.660]  the Muslim fanatic Kitas, this culture wants women as sex objects
[01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:42.660]  and then this guy couldn't have what he wanted.
[01:38:42.660 --> 01:38:46.660]  What a narcissistic spoiled brat who thought he was God
[01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:50.660]  if you watch the full clip. And he just thought,
[01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:52.660]  oh, totally creepy.
[01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:57.660]  Well, it also is just a pop-up on drugs that the father,
[01:38:57.660 --> 01:39:02.660]  in addition to his directorial abilities,
[01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:09.660]  also made quite a bit of fame and money by taking pictures of women
[01:39:09.660 --> 01:39:16.660]  in front of things like the Taj Mahal and famous buildings.
[01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:23.660]  So, apparently, the father did not ever display to the son
[01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:26.660]  that women are to be treated with respect.
[01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:29.660]  Basically, he was at least in my life.
[01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:32.660]  Well, I know this because a bunch of sickos out in California
[01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:35.660]  are going crazy. Doesn't mean I have to turn my guns in.
[01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:38.660]  I need my guns to protect myself from fruits like him.
[01:39:38.660 --> 01:39:40.660]  I appreciate your call.
[01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:42.660]  Let's talk to Patricia in Arizona.
[01:39:42.660 --> 01:39:45.660]  You're on the air. Patricia, thanks for holding.
[01:39:45.660 --> 01:39:48.660]  Hi, Alex. Listen, I grew up in Southern California
[01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:51.660]  and one thing I can tell you is I'm older
[01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:56.660]  and I used to go to these mansions after school with these kids
[01:39:56.660 --> 01:39:59.660]  and there was a total disconnect.
[01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:01.660]  Their parents would be in the movie business
[01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:04.660]  or be high-powered executives and they were never there.
[01:40:04.660 --> 01:40:08.660]  It was like they had a puppy that they threw into a beautiful canal
[01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:10.660]  and every day they threw it at a snake
[01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:12.660]  but they never paid any attention to it.
[01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:14.660]  They turned around and ran away.
[01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:18.660]  And now we have generation after generation of these people
[01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:21.660]  who grew up and had children and they probably are completely disconnected
[01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:23.660]  from their children.
[01:40:23.660 --> 01:40:25.660]  No, that's it. And then the guy, they call it Asperger's,
[01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:28.660]  but he just didn't have any real human connection to people
[01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:30.660]  and he thought a bunch of drugs.
[01:40:30.660 --> 01:40:32.660]  Watch, that's the next shoot-a-drop.
[01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:34.660]  I'll take one look at this guy and see his MO.
[01:40:34.660 --> 01:40:36.660]  It's the same MO every time.
[01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:38.660]  And he'll probably try and he's a devil worshiper too.
[01:40:38.660 --> 01:40:42.660]  It's almost every time. I mean, it's like we need to profile rich devil worshippers.
[01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:45.660]  Rich kids. I mean, I'm telling you, I don't take the blame.
[01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:47.660]  You don't take the blame.
[01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:51.660]  This little guy in his family takes the blame.
[01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:53.660]  I don't know if that's his look,
[01:40:53.660 --> 01:40:55.660]  but his teeth look like they've been filed
[01:40:55.660 --> 01:40:58.660]  like the Twilight group of kids who are into that vampire.
[01:40:58.660 --> 01:41:01.660]  Oh, yeah, it's going to come out just like all of them.
[01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:03.660]  I hear you great points, Patricia.
[01:41:03.660 --> 01:41:07.660]  A lot of people think you got to get money to raise your kids right.
[01:41:07.660 --> 01:41:09.660]  That's not even true, folks.
[01:41:09.660 --> 01:41:12.660]  I mean, the rich kids are so spoiled, it's unbelievable.
[01:41:12.660 --> 01:41:15.660]  Sherry in Fredericksburg. Where are you calling from?
[01:41:15.660 --> 01:41:18.660]  Fredericksburg, Texas or Virginia?
[01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:19.660]  Texas.
[01:41:19.660 --> 01:41:20.660]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:41:20.660 --> 01:41:23.660]  Okay, this is a little different consideration
[01:41:23.660 --> 01:41:25.660]  and here's what I think could be going on.
[01:41:25.660 --> 01:41:29.660]  It can cause a really big problem that can result in suicide
[01:41:29.660 --> 01:41:32.660]  when a man or a woman looks like one sex
[01:41:32.660 --> 01:41:35.660]  but has a proclivity towards another.
[01:41:35.660 --> 01:41:37.660]  And you combine that with drugs
[01:41:37.660 --> 01:41:39.660]  and I think it can be deadly.
[01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:42.660]  Now, I personally think from having seen him on TV
[01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:47.660]  that he's exquisitely beautiful man who looks like a woman
[01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:49.660]  and if, as a case in point,
[01:41:49.660 --> 01:41:53.660]  if a doctor who predetermines the sex of a baby,
[01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:56.660]  which isn't the case here, but in those cases,
[01:41:56.660 --> 01:41:59.660]  when the sex is ambiguous,
[01:41:59.660 --> 01:42:02.660]  if a doctor can do mental damage
[01:42:02.660 --> 01:42:05.660]  that results in suicide on down the line,
[01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:12.660]  then combine his possible problem
[01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:15.660]  like it would be connected to a problem with someone who...
[01:42:15.660 --> 01:42:17.660]  I mean, I hear what you're saying.
[01:42:17.660 --> 01:42:20.660]  There's not enough liability with the drug companies, number one.
[01:42:20.660 --> 01:42:24.660]  I don't think you can send the liability to all the counselors and people.
[01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:27.660]  There's a lot of good counselors out there, but undoubtedly.
[01:42:27.660 --> 01:42:30.660]  Undoubtedly, it's the pharma key involved
[01:42:30.660 --> 01:42:35.660]  and the way the diagnoses are written up in the official psychology books,
[01:42:35.660 --> 01:42:38.660]  what do they call it, the DSEM or what's it called?
[01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:40.660]  DSM.
[01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:44.660]  I mean, they call thinking the government's corrupt mentally ill.
[01:42:44.660 --> 01:42:48.660]  JAMA came out this week, Journal of American Medical Association,
[01:42:48.660 --> 01:42:51.660]  and said, if you think cell phones give you brain cancer, you're mentally ill.
[01:42:51.660 --> 01:42:53.660]  There's over a thousand studies proving it.
[01:42:53.660 --> 01:42:55.660]  London Guardian reported it last week.
[01:42:55.660 --> 01:43:24.660]  More calls coming up. Stay with us and some other news.
[01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:27.660]  We'll do, link to numerous conditions.
[01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:31.660]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:34.660]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me
[01:43:34.660 --> 01:43:39.660]  it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment
[01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:41.660]  that we cannot escape until we can fight back against.
[01:43:41.660 --> 01:43:46.660]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A.
[01:43:46.660 --> 01:43:50.660]  The new Info Wars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle
[01:43:50.660 --> 01:43:52.660]  that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:43:52.660 --> 01:43:55.660]  Now available exclusively at infowarslife.com
[01:43:55.660 --> 01:43:59.660]  or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:43:59.660 --> 01:44:03.660]  Journal, what do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday
[01:44:03.660 --> 01:44:05.660]  about a potential foretoot situation?
[01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:09.660]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:11.660]  Here we go, talk, stop being a soldier.
[01:44:11.660 --> 01:44:15.660]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news,
[01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:17.660]  Info Wars is the tip of the spear.
[01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:20.660]  Is this another force-flight stage attack to take our civil liberties
[01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:23.660]  and promote homeland security while sticking the hands down on our pants on the streets?
[01:44:23.660 --> 01:44:27.660]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere
[01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:30.660]  and that's what prisonplanet.tv is designed to do.
[01:44:30.660 --> 01:44:36.660]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons
[01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:38.660]  against the so-called rebels.
[01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:42.660]  What we see now is a war against reality, it's a war against the truth.
[01:44:42.660 --> 01:44:45.660]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom
[01:44:45.660 --> 01:44:47.660]  become members of prisonplanet.tv

[01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:03.660]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:46:03.660 --> 01:46:07.660]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminate.
[01:46:07.660 --> 01:46:11.660]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:14.660]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:19.660]  My friend's water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family

[01:46:22.660 --> 01:46:26.660]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:46:26.660 --> 01:46:30.660]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.

[01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:13.660]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[01:47:13.660 --> 01:47:18.660]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. infowarstore.com, yeah.
[01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:22.660]  Thank you, my judge, for that intro.
[01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:39.660]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:49.660]  Final segment will try to go to CyberBully, Chris, Dennis, Bob, Anthony, and Angry American from America.
[01:47:49.660 --> 01:47:56.660]  But I wanted to hit this because Memorial Day is tomorrow. We will have a special, original edition tomorrow.
[01:47:56.660 --> 01:48:01.660]  When I say I'm live, we're live. Original means I tape the show just for tomorrow.
[01:48:01.660 --> 01:48:05.660]  Some of it's rebroadcast, but a bunch of it's taped brand new. I taped it Friday.
[01:48:05.660 --> 01:48:09.660]  So that's coming up tomorrow, 11 a.m. Central. I'll be back Tuesday live.
[01:48:09.660 --> 01:48:13.660]  I'm tempted just to come in. There's so much news, I tell you.
[01:48:13.660 --> 01:48:16.660]  We're going to think about it when the show ends. We'll see what happens tomorrow, 11 a.m. Central.
[01:48:16.660 --> 01:48:20.660]  infowarstore.com for affiliates, links, free podcasts, all of it.
[01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:24.660]  And I want to talk about this because Memorial Day is coming up tomorrow.
[01:48:24.660 --> 01:48:33.660]  This was last year in November, CNN reported the suicide rate of 22 vets killing themselves a day.
[01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:40.660]  Now they estimate it could be high as 26. So if you average that together, every hour a veteran is killing themselves,
[01:48:40.660 --> 01:48:46.660]  more people die in active duty from suicide now than from combat.
[01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:51.660]  And this is something they want to just cover up. And a lot of it's because they have to wait for VA here.
[01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:55.660]  We've got a bunch of investigative reports we've been breaking. More are going to break tomorrow.
[01:48:55.660 --> 01:48:57.660]  We've got some special reports we're going to premiere tomorrow.
[01:48:57.660 --> 01:49:02.660]  A lot of our crew members are veterans themselves like Staff Sergeant Biggs and Weldon and others.
[01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:07.660]  So we're able to basically infiltrate and get this. We've got some stuff that's going to be national news coming out.
[01:49:07.660 --> 01:49:10.660]  On the VA and the death list and the death panels and the rest of it.
[01:49:10.660 --> 01:49:15.660]  So the media is not telling us to care about the veterans though. They're just veterans, let them die.
[01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:20.660]  But all these six people got killed, those guns, guns, half of them from knives.
[01:49:20.660 --> 01:49:29.660]  That's a big deal for me. And meanwhile, CBS News reports, bodies of 28 veterans and L.A. Morg will finally receive proper burial.
[01:49:29.660 --> 01:49:36.660]  Some of them have been there for six months, rotting bodies or cool down bodies, slowly rotting.
[01:49:36.660 --> 01:49:41.660]  Just stacking up. And meanwhile, the VA is so corrupt now under Obamacare that they're moving to VA,
[01:49:41.660 --> 01:49:45.660]  turns to private hospitals for help that he'll new paper reports.
[01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:48.660]  Sooner won't be private hospitals under Obamacare, so it won't matter.
[01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:54.660]  Let's go to your phone calls. Shiberbully in Jacksonville, Florida. Thanks for calling. You're on the air.
[01:49:54.660 --> 01:50:02.660]  Hey Alex, I just want to say this is ridiculous that we now have to focus on this type of drama queen issue instead of more important issues.
[01:50:02.660 --> 01:50:09.660]  I think that his perfect TSA material, and he should have been on Supermail Vitality, you know, that have prevented the whole thing.
[01:50:09.660 --> 01:50:19.660]  No, I hear you. I mean, I have real trouble understanding guys that are driving around in brand new BMWs and are wearing nice clothes and can't pick women up.
[01:50:19.660 --> 01:50:22.660]  Well, the problem is he doesn't see himself as a leader.
[01:50:22.660 --> 01:50:27.660]  You know, and what I've noticed since I've become politically awakened is that women look at you different.
[01:50:27.660 --> 01:50:32.660]  You know, my wife looks at me different. It's just that role of being a man in manhood.
[01:50:32.660 --> 01:50:39.660]  No, men are supposed to be involved in society, leading society, not busy watching ESPN all day.
[01:50:39.660 --> 01:50:45.660]  And that's what women are looking for. But the media tells people, act metrosexual, you'll get women.
[01:50:45.660 --> 01:50:48.660]  No, you're not going to get women.
[01:50:48.660 --> 01:50:58.660]  This is a whole trendy society. But hey, I want to offer a solution. I got a $5 solution for anybody that wants to get active.
[01:50:58.660 --> 01:51:02.660]  Basically, go get a big black Sharpie marker, go get a poster board, make up a big message, put in fours at the bottom, go stand in traffic.
[01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:08.660]  You know, it's effective change. It is right now change and basically balls in your court.
[01:51:08.660 --> 01:51:13.660]  And by the way, it's about getting out in front of people and not caring what they think.
[01:51:13.660 --> 01:51:18.660]  The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step. Great points. Shiver bully.
[01:51:18.660 --> 01:51:22.660]  Let's talk to Christian Indiana. You're on the air.
[01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:23.660]  Hey, Alex.
[01:51:23.660 --> 01:51:25.660]  Hey, brother.
[01:51:25.660 --> 01:51:33.660]  Hey, do this. How 9000 one of the that was terrorizing Santa Barbara, California.
[01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:43.660]  They're coming.
[01:51:43.660 --> 01:51:45.660]  Yeah, I'm talking about potalk and the rest of them.
[01:51:45.660 --> 01:51:52.660]  I tell you, this hunger games connection to the last three big shootings is really getting suspicious.
[01:51:52.660 --> 01:51:56.660]  Yeah. Now, this might be some kind of style.
[01:51:56.660 --> 01:52:05.660]  I just want to think of the impact it has on both men and women in this country. And they cannot be taken aback by this women.
[01:52:05.660 --> 01:52:14.660]  Women and men. I don't want women to be afraid to reject certain men and men might become more self-conscious and out to prove they are not fatal past like this.
[01:52:14.660 --> 01:52:22.660]  Well, yeah, I mean, look, I mean, exactly. It's like people don't let their kids play in their yard anymore, even though kidnapping is not up from 50 years ago.
[01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:30.660]  It's a perception. And yeah, I guess now you have to worship every twit in a BMW nerd because they might kill you if you don't.
[01:52:30.660 --> 01:52:32.660]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:52:32.660 --> 01:52:35.660]  All right. I'm happy Memorial Day, Alex. Thank you.
[01:52:35.660 --> 01:52:41.660]  Thank you so much, YouTube brother. Great point. Let's talk to Dennis in Colorado. You're on the air, Dennis.
[01:52:41.660 --> 01:52:42.660]  Hey, can you hear me?
[01:52:42.660 --> 01:52:43.660]  Yes, sir.
[01:52:43.660 --> 01:52:46.660]  All right. God bless you, Alex. Thanks for the Sunday show.
[01:52:46.660 --> 01:52:55.660]  One of the points I want to make is the old cop shop back in the old days where I grew up, it was guns don't kill people. People kill people.
[01:52:55.660 --> 01:53:04.660]  And it's just ridiculous that they go off on this. I mean, even when I was in Rockford, Illinois, working out there, somebody killed somebody with a hatchet.
[01:53:04.660 --> 01:53:11.660]  Oh, we started by a hatchet in Rockford, Illinois. Well, where does it stop?
[01:53:11.660 --> 01:53:17.660]  I know. I mean, I was looking it up. There's close to 10,000 baseball bat killings a year.
[01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:21.660]  I mean, you're going to ban baseball bats? I mean, it's, you know.
[01:53:21.660 --> 01:53:29.660]  But I mean, they are, though, they're banning dodgeball, baseball, because the kids get hurt playing it. You're going to get hurt, folks.
[01:53:29.660 --> 01:53:34.660]  If you don't get hurt in life, you turn into a spoiled rotten jellyfish like this guy.
[01:53:34.660 --> 01:53:45.660]  That's right. And the other thing was that my cousin, my wife's cousin was a administrator down there at that college where that Aurora killer, Adam Lanzar, whatever his name was.
[01:53:45.660 --> 01:53:56.660]  And he said he walked around like a zombie. Well, you know, he shot all these people, then he stands out there by his car like a breasted, you know, dead brain zombie.
[01:53:56.660 --> 01:54:02.660]  You know, I don't see that with the adrenaline factor on that. That seems made up to me.
[01:54:02.660 --> 01:54:09.660]  Yeah, I know the Aurora shooter was homes. And I appreciate your call. We should recap in live this this week.
[01:54:09.660 --> 01:54:17.660]  Recap the Aurora shooting. I mean, that was mind control with the Air Force and DARPA. And he was in a mind control program.
[01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:26.660]  It's like the LA Times reported Kaczynski. Theodore Kaczynski, the unabomber was in the MK ultra program for 10 years.
[01:54:26.660 --> 01:54:34.660]  That was declassified after he was imprisoned. And then no one cares. It's like the unabomber was in a mind control program.
[01:54:34.660 --> 01:54:41.660]  It's admitted and no one wants to talk about it. You look at Aurora. I don't have an hour to get into a round of time.
[01:54:41.660 --> 01:54:50.660]  I mean, go back, folks. It was staged, multiple shooters, all of it. I mean, that was staged. We know what happened there.
[01:54:50.660 --> 01:54:58.660]  We don't know what happened at Sandy Hook. We just know it's staged. We know the official stories a lie. In any investigation, in most of them,
[01:54:58.660 --> 01:55:05.660]  you don't know exactly what happened till somebody confesses or you get all the pieces. But you know what you're being told is bull.
[01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:14.660]  And you see the political preparation before it happens and the exploitation in Bloomberg a day before his internal emails that came out,
[01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:22.660]  even mainstream news reported it, about get ready for a big mass shooting, prepare the social media. I mean, it's very suspicious, false flag evidence.
[01:55:22.660 --> 01:55:29.660]  They just caught the Turkish government false flagging Syria a few months ago. That was admitted they were staging attacks. That was in BBC.
[01:55:29.660 --> 01:55:38.660]  I mean, this goes on, folks. This goes on. Anthony in Florida. Go ahead. Thanks for holding. You gone, Anthony?
[01:55:38.660 --> 01:55:48.660]  All right. Go ahead. Go ahead. Hello? Yeah. Oh, yeah. I was watching. I look at this guy and it's obvious that there's not just one thing wrong with him.
[01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:58.660]  There's a lot. There's a lot wrong with him because, you know, he's just another one. Just another one. And now they're going to blame gun owners.
[01:55:58.660 --> 01:56:01.660]  And it's just not the case.
[01:56:01.660 --> 01:56:11.660]  No, I hear you and I appreciate your call. Look at this. Hollywood reporter. Walt Disney family feud inside his grandkids battle.
[01:56:11.660 --> 01:56:22.660]  And it goes on that they were under mind control. I've always seen the reports of mind control and the mouse kateers being under mind control and the evidence of it.
[01:56:22.660 --> 01:56:30.660]  And so many of these people, I mean, Disney is some kind of weird operation, folks, and the subliminals in it. They've been caught doing all the sex subliminals.
[01:56:30.660 --> 01:56:39.660]  I mean, something's going on at Disney, folks. Something's going on. And this is my control is real, folks. I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on.
[01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:46.660]  We're out of time so far. Let's go to Angry American in America. Go ahead. You're our last caller. Go ahead.
[01:56:46.660 --> 01:57:08.660]  Hi, Alex. My theory on this whole thing is that this kid was targeted that his dad, you know, being the director of the Hunger Games, they were mad that that accurately depicted the struggle that actors and actresses go through to get into Hollywood and then get pimped out to real people that are elites.
[01:57:08.660 --> 01:57:21.660]  So I'm figuring that because his dad's a conservative and a soldier of Christianity, that he was targeted. Wait, I didn't know that, really? Yeah. And they killed two birds with one stone, you know.
[01:57:21.660 --> 01:57:37.660]  Well, we'll know more. We'll know more about Amara. And on the radio at 11 a.m. and we'll have the nightly news and I'll be filing YouTube videos, infowars.com, tomorrow, regardless. As more comes out, we'll have it at infowars.com and drugreport.com is doing a great job as well with full coverage of this.
[01:57:37.660 --> 01:57:52.660]  Great job with the crew coming in. Have a wonderful Memorial Day. Think about actually taking care of the vets, not just paying them lip service tomorrow as well. That's my view on that. Thanks to all the affiliates and sponsors as well. And the good Lord above.
