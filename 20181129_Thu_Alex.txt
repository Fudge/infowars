[00:00.000 --> 00:25.880]  I told you weeks ago and I told you Sunday Trump's getting ready to release the secret
[00:25.880 --> 00:28.240]  documents and Hillary's emails.
[00:28.240 --> 00:29.240]  He's got them.
[00:29.240 --> 00:34.240]  There's the headline, Trump threatens to declassify devastating dots about the Democrats.
[00:34.240 --> 00:35.240]  They don't care.
[00:35.240 --> 00:41.000]  They've got the rat singing Cohen, changing his stories more time than even Bill Clinton
[00:41.000 --> 00:42.160]  does.
[00:42.160 --> 00:44.640]  It is the battle against America and the deep state.
[00:44.640 --> 00:46.520]  Trump's improving right again.
[00:46.520 --> 00:50.680]  The private Federal Reserve raising interest rates is trying to kill the economy.
[00:50.680 --> 00:55.040]  It's all coming up on the number one banned broadcast in the world, whatever you do, share
[00:55.040 --> 00:58.440]  those live links and tell folks about local stations to break the back of the censors.
[00:58.440 --> 01:05.800]  But first, our reporters are on the ground in Mexico and went inside the UN refugee
[01:05.800 --> 01:07.640]  centers and it is bedlam.
[01:07.640 --> 01:14.760]  Here's a report from the front lines.
[01:14.760 --> 01:21.960]  As a result of the UN mandated replacement migration program funded by EU taxpayers,
[01:21.960 --> 01:28.960]  we have seen over 15 million refugees flood Europe, give an EU taxpayer money and absolutely
[01:28.960 --> 01:33.240]  no incentive to assimilate to their host countries.
[01:33.240 --> 01:40.040]  It is breaking them in every way and now the United Nations has its sights set upon the
[01:40.040 --> 01:43.040]  United States of America.
[01:43.040 --> 01:49.600]  The UN led migrant caravan began thousands of miles from the US, politically trained
[01:49.600 --> 01:54.840]  and funded with US taxpayer dollars from USAID.
[01:54.840 --> 01:58.480]  The migrant caravan has reached the US southern border.
[01:58.480 --> 02:02.120]  Hundreds of them have already probed for weaknesses.
[02:02.120 --> 02:07.200]  Thousands of them are now living in tents in a park off of Cinco de Mayo Street in Tijuana,
[02:07.200 --> 02:08.960]  Mexico.
[02:08.960 --> 02:13.960]  We visited there this evening and it made the whole story real.
[02:13.960 --> 02:20.760]  The UN organized clash of cultures is now taking its toll in Tijuana.
[02:20.760 --> 02:26.600]  There has been more violence and more crime which has hurt the local businesses that already
[02:26.600 --> 02:29.440]  struggle each day to survive.
[02:29.440 --> 02:35.680]  There are thousands in Tijuana and there are thousands more said to be coming.
[02:35.680 --> 02:41.560]  They have demands as proxies of the UN replacement migration agenda.
[02:41.560 --> 02:49.800]  They demand to cross freely into the United States and they demand immediate US citizenship.
[02:49.800 --> 02:55.840]  Even as we speak the UN is attempting to ratify a new global treaty on the rights of migrants
[02:55.840 --> 03:03.160]  to travel anywhere in the world, effectively erasing national sovereignty and borders forever.
[03:03.160 --> 03:09.040]  This is the world government takeover using giant impoverished third world populations
[03:09.040 --> 03:15.040]  converted to globalism, weaponized and used as tools to bring down the once great first
[03:15.040 --> 03:17.200]  world nation states.
[03:17.200 --> 03:22.840]  Once all have been reduced to poverty and serfdom, the globalist plan for total domination
[03:22.840 --> 03:25.080]  would be complete.
[03:25.080 --> 03:39.160]  This is Greg Ries and Tijuana, Mexico, reporting for infowars.com.
[03:39.160 --> 03:47.560]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, the point breaking the conditioning.
[03:47.560 --> 04:01.680]  Alex Jones come to mind, Alex Jones, Alex Jones.
[04:01.680 --> 04:05.080]  and body count story, that's according to website InfoWars.
[04:05.080 --> 04:07.600]  It's time we get confirmed, there are recent shooters
[04:07.600 --> 04:10.440]  with fully automatic weapons, not a carry-on shot.
[04:10.440 --> 04:13.280]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death
[04:13.280 --> 04:14.560]  in Memphis, Tennessee.
[04:14.560 --> 04:17.800]  J.F.K. was shot from the back and the front.
[04:17.800 --> 04:20.680]  He was almost a visitor of planned impulsion.
[04:20.680 --> 04:22.680]  It's just pancake.
[04:22.680 --> 04:24.760]  He took the babies out of the incubators.
[04:24.760 --> 04:27.520]  He must be choking because I have a cold spot.
[04:27.520 --> 04:29.600]  I think this is a national security imperative.
[04:29.600 --> 04:32.280]  We have clear things that we do not understand
[04:32.280 --> 04:36.760]  how they were operated in areas that we can't control.
[04:36.760 --> 04:40.080]  USA, is this global governance at last?
[04:40.080 --> 04:42.560]  Is it one world essential bankers in charge?
[04:42.560 --> 04:44.880]  Israel claims the attack was accidental.
[04:44.880 --> 04:48.120]  Some former U.S. naval officers say it was on purpose.
[04:48.120 --> 04:51.600]  They describe today's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[04:51.600 --> 04:55.640]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump
[04:55.640 --> 04:57.200]  during visits to Moscow.
[04:57.200 --> 05:00.560]  Russia, stop. Denied everything. It called it all fake news.
[05:00.560 --> 05:03.560]  Globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen
[05:03.560 --> 05:05.640]  and pump the environment full of the bad halogens,
[05:05.640 --> 05:08.040]  fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it,
[05:08.040 --> 05:09.600]  that it lowers IQ.
[05:09.600 --> 05:12.480]  It literally dumps the population down.
[05:12.480 --> 05:14.840]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers
[05:14.840 --> 05:16.600]  the best iodine in the world,
[05:16.600 --> 05:19.160]  we've gone through two permutations.
[05:19.160 --> 05:21.960]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good
[05:21.960 --> 05:23.600]  but hard to source, and the globalists
[05:23.600 --> 05:25.400]  tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[05:25.400 --> 05:29.080]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine
[05:29.080 --> 05:31.640]  and brought you X2. That's been incredible.
[05:31.640 --> 05:34.040]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that,
[05:34.040 --> 05:36.800]  we did more research and secured more
[05:36.800 --> 05:38.720]  of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[05:38.720 --> 05:42.400]  But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research
[05:42.400 --> 05:44.880]  that by combining it with three other compounds,
[05:44.880 --> 05:47.280]  two forms of iodine and vitamin C,
[05:47.280 --> 05:52.280]  it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[05:52.800 --> 05:54.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it,
[05:54.560 --> 05:56.880]  you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[05:56.880 --> 06:00.080]  X3, now available at InfoWarsLive.com.
[06:01.320 --> 06:02.880]  We've got it, we've got it, we've got it, we've got it.
[06:02.880 --> 06:04.560]  Thank you for the space that's coming to you.
[06:04.560 --> 06:05.400]  Thank you.
[06:08.400 --> 06:10.680]  Waging War on Corruption.
[06:10.680 --> 06:12.720]  All right, you have gold.
[06:12.720 --> 06:16.200]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live
[06:16.200 --> 06:18.640]  from the front lines of the Info War.
[06:18.640 --> 06:19.480]  All right, you have gold.
[06:19.480 --> 06:21.320]  We've got it, we've got it, we've got it, we've got it.
[06:21.320 --> 06:23.680]  We've seen the earth.
[06:23.680 --> 06:26.960]  We've got it, we've got it, we've got it.
[06:26.960 --> 06:29.280]  We've seen the earth.
[06:29.280 --> 06:32.360]  We've got it, we've got it.
[06:32.360 --> 06:34.840]  We've seen the earth.
[06:34.840 --> 06:37.800]  We've got it, we've got it.
[06:37.800 --> 06:39.800]  We've seen the earth.
[06:45.920 --> 06:48.520]  There is a lot of controversy around this network
[06:48.520 --> 06:51.120]  about Alex Jones, for example.
[06:51.120 --> 06:53.840]  It's Alex Jones.
[06:53.840 --> 06:58.120]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who
[06:58.120 --> 06:59.720]  is apparently...
[06:59.720 --> 07:00.720]  Alex Jones.
[07:03.720 --> 07:05.720]  Stop, Russian, stop!
[07:05.720 --> 07:07.720]  If the war comes to mind.
[07:10.720 --> 07:12.720]  Reputating the war.
[07:12.720 --> 07:14.720]  We've got it.
[07:14.720 --> 07:16.720]  We've got it, we've got it, we've got it.
[07:16.720 --> 07:19.720]  We've got it, we've got it, we've got it.
[07:19.720 --> 07:21.720]  Reputation's amazing.
[07:21.720 --> 07:23.720]  I will not let you down.
[07:23.720 --> 07:26.720]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[07:37.720 --> 07:40.720]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War
[07:40.720 --> 07:43.720]  and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this,
[07:43.720 --> 07:49.720]  but you want to fight, you better believe you've got one.
[07:49.720 --> 07:52.720]  From the front lines of the Information War,
[07:52.720 --> 07:54.720]  it's Alex Jones.
[07:54.720 --> 07:56.720]  Alex Jones.
[08:11.720 --> 08:17.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, November 29th, 2018.
[08:17.720 --> 08:27.720]  And I'm on the edge of my seat like I've never before been.
[08:27.720 --> 08:29.720]  As I told you two years ago,
[08:29.720 --> 08:32.720]  they were illegally spying on Trump in the campaign.
[08:32.720 --> 08:36.720]  We told you the exact specifics of how it was done.
[08:36.720 --> 08:40.720]  You'll notice we're not under investigation for that.
[08:40.720 --> 08:43.720]  We're under supposed investigation for talking to WikiLeaks,
[08:43.720 --> 08:47.720]  which everybody else was doing and trying to do.
[08:47.720 --> 08:49.720]  And they somehow, by extension, turned that into the election
[08:49.720 --> 08:51.720]  being stolen by the Russians.
[08:51.720 --> 08:53.720]  They've now got Michael Cohen,
[08:53.720 --> 08:55.720]  who has just pled guilty to lying to Congress,
[08:55.720 --> 08:57.720]  lying to the FBI, lying to everyone else,
[08:57.720 --> 09:01.720]  when he said that Trump wasn't involved with the Russians.
[09:01.720 --> 09:06.720]  Now that he was caught laundering $15 million in his taxicab company
[09:06.720 --> 09:11.720]  that has zero to do with President Trump,
[09:11.720 --> 09:18.720]  suddenly he's singing like a big, fat, drunken canary
[09:18.720 --> 09:20.720]  and saying whatever,
[09:20.720 --> 09:24.720]  Deep State creature Robert Mueller
[09:24.720 --> 09:26.720]  and Hillary's former top lawyer,
[09:26.720 --> 09:29.720]  who's the head prosecutor on the case, wants.
[09:29.720 --> 09:32.720]  And Trump is a very judicious person.
[09:32.720 --> 09:34.720]  He doesn't like to start fights.
[09:34.720 --> 09:36.720]  He doesn't start them. He finishes them.
[09:36.720 --> 09:40.720]  And he has the totally devastating FISA report
[09:40.720 --> 09:45.720]  that was a classified report put out by the federal courts
[09:45.720 --> 09:48.720]  that we made a huge deal about a year ago,
[09:48.720 --> 09:50.720]  the media totally ignored it,
[09:50.720 --> 09:53.720]  because that Inspector General report of the federal courts
[09:53.720 --> 09:57.720]  said that they were given false information and lies
[09:57.720 --> 10:00.720]  three times to reverse engineer,
[10:00.720 --> 10:05.720]  parallel construct and create fake investigation trails
[10:05.720 --> 10:09.720]  to bring to the courts to get warrants on President Trump
[10:09.720 --> 10:13.720]  and his operation.
[10:13.720 --> 10:16.720]  And anyone associated with him, including yours truly,
[10:16.720 --> 10:19.720]  Roger Stone, Dr. Jerome Corsi, you name it.
[10:19.720 --> 10:22.720]  And you better believe Tucker Carlson's under surveillance
[10:22.720 --> 10:26.720]  and Matt Drudge and Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity,
[10:26.720 --> 10:31.720]  anybody loyal to this country has a magnifying glass shoved up
[10:31.720 --> 10:34.720]  their rear end and has harassed unbelievably.
[10:34.720 --> 10:36.720]  Most people just don't complain about it on air.
[10:36.720 --> 10:39.720]  A lot of folks take this supermanly road
[10:39.720 --> 10:42.720]  and don't even discuss what's happening to them.
[10:42.720 --> 10:46.720]  But let me tell you, it's been one hell of a war.
[10:46.720 --> 10:48.720]  And for everything you've heard about on air,
[10:48.720 --> 10:52.720]  there's been a thousand percent more that you didn't hear about.
[10:52.720 --> 10:57.720]  So when Trump says that Cohen is a very weak person
[10:57.720 --> 11:01.720]  and that Mueller is a monster and that there are a lot of heroes,
[11:01.720 --> 11:04.720]  he told the New York Post yesterday that Roger Stone
[11:04.720 --> 11:08.720]  and Dr. Corsi are heroes and Paul Manafort's a hero
[11:08.720 --> 11:12.720]  because they've been told you will lie
[11:12.720 --> 11:15.720]  or we will put your ash under the present.
[11:15.720 --> 11:19.720]  And so far, they've not done that.
[11:19.720 --> 11:21.720]  So here's the big announcement.
[11:21.720 --> 11:26.720]  Here is the huge announcement.
[11:26.720 --> 11:28.720]  And we have the video coming up.
[11:28.720 --> 11:31.720]  Trump threatens to declassify, quote,
[11:31.720 --> 11:36.720]  devastating docks about Democrats.
[11:36.720 --> 11:39.720]  Now, I can tell you that at least 17 agencies
[11:39.720 --> 11:42.720]  and 800,000 plus private contractors
[11:42.720 --> 11:45.720]  have access to Hillary's emails.
[11:45.720 --> 11:48.720]  She hung them out there like a street walkin' hooker
[11:48.720 --> 11:54.720]  shakes her butt on the corner of Main Street at midnight.
[11:54.720 --> 11:57.720]  So Hillary put that server out there
[11:57.720 --> 12:00.720]  so she could leak stuff, put out this info,
[12:00.720 --> 12:02.720]  but also for paper play,
[12:02.720 --> 12:04.720]  get people to pay through the foundation
[12:04.720 --> 12:06.720]  so she would then leak more info.
[12:06.720 --> 12:07.720]  And that's how it works.
[12:07.720 --> 12:08.720]  It's like a vending machine.
[12:08.720 --> 12:10.720]  You put money into the foundation
[12:10.720 --> 12:12.720]  and then she puts whatever you want on the server.
[12:12.720 --> 12:16.720]  So that server was like a big pile of horse manure
[12:16.720 --> 12:19.720]  with flies crawling all over it.
[12:19.720 --> 12:22.720]  And obviously the U.S. military and others
[12:22.720 --> 12:25.720]  were watching everything she did
[12:25.720 --> 12:28.720]  and they have every bit of it and more.
[12:28.720 --> 12:30.720]  They don't just have her stuff.
[12:30.720 --> 12:32.720]  They tracked every wormhole back to it.
[12:32.720 --> 12:35.720]  Trump is a person that delegates.
[12:35.720 --> 12:38.720]  He's been given briefings on what's in all of it.
[12:38.720 --> 12:41.720]  He held off and he went ahead and told the Pentagon
[12:41.720 --> 12:44.720]  three weeks ago,
[12:44.720 --> 12:47.720]  prepared transcripts for Congress of everything.
[12:47.720 --> 12:49.720]  And they said, sir, what do you mean everything?
[12:49.720 --> 12:51.720]  He said anything, everything.
[12:51.720 --> 12:53.720]  I'm about to give full authorization.
[12:53.720 --> 12:55.720]  Whatever the worst stuff is, everything.
[12:55.720 --> 12:56.720]  Prepare it.
[12:56.720 --> 12:58.720]  They said, yes, sure.
[12:58.720 --> 13:03.720]  And so they are preparing nightmare mountains.
[13:03.720 --> 13:06.720]  I mean, believe me, none of us even know what's in this.
[13:06.720 --> 13:08.720]  This is so huge.
[13:08.720 --> 13:12.720]  It isn't just going to be the illegal warrants and the lying.
[13:12.720 --> 13:13.720]  It's everything.
[13:13.720 --> 13:14.720]  It's Mueller's text messages.
[13:14.720 --> 13:16.720]  It's Mueller recorded on the phone.
[13:16.720 --> 13:17.720]  It's Hillary.
[13:17.720 --> 13:18.720]  It's all of them.
[13:18.720 --> 13:20.720]  It's their own system that they arrogantly thought
[13:20.720 --> 13:25.720]  they'd be in control of because Hillary was supposed to win
[13:25.720 --> 13:27.720]  and continue on this globalist regime
[13:27.720 --> 13:30.720]  that started with George Herbert Walker Bush for four years
[13:30.720 --> 13:33.720]  and then the Clinton's co-presidents for eight years
[13:33.720 --> 13:35.720]  and then George W. for eight years
[13:35.720 --> 13:38.720]  and then Obama for eight years and then Hillary for eight years.
[13:38.720 --> 13:42.720]  It was supposed to go on forever with her co-president
[13:42.720 --> 13:47.720]  since 1993, right through with Obama and continuing.
[13:47.720 --> 13:51.720]  So they recklessly, like criminals always do
[13:51.720 --> 13:53.720]  and they've gotten away with stuff for a long time,
[13:53.720 --> 13:59.720]  bank robbers, child molesters, child kidnappers, serial killers,
[13:59.720 --> 14:01.720]  just standard robbers.
[14:01.720 --> 14:06.720]  They're pretty careful when they steal the first 10, 20, 30, 100 times.
[14:06.720 --> 14:09.720]  But after a while, they get sloppy.
[14:09.720 --> 14:12.720]  It's just criminology.
[14:12.720 --> 14:14.720]  And so Trump doesn't even use email.
[14:14.720 --> 14:18.720]  Trump only acts like he's being recorded all the time.
[14:18.720 --> 14:21.720]  He's been a target for 45 years.
[14:21.720 --> 14:29.720]  There's nothing on Trump, nothing, nothing but liking women
[14:29.720 --> 14:32.720]  and not as many as people think.
[14:32.720 --> 14:33.720]  But that's it.
[14:33.720 --> 14:35.720]  He never said he was a choir boy.
[14:35.720 --> 14:36.720]  He likes women.
[14:36.720 --> 14:37.720]  That's all they got.
[14:37.720 --> 14:39.720]  There's no inward tape.
[14:39.720 --> 14:40.720]  There's nothing.
[14:40.720 --> 14:42.720]  And you get into Robert Mueller, you get into Hillary Clinton,
[14:42.720 --> 14:44.720]  you get into Barack Obama, you get into all these people.
[14:44.720 --> 14:48.720]  These people are dirty and they're arrogant.
[14:48.720 --> 14:51.720]  I think as they've got dirt on everybody else, they're supposedly safe
[14:51.720 --> 14:53.720]  because no one would ever call their bluff.
[14:53.720 --> 14:54.720]  Well, guess what?
[14:54.720 --> 14:59.720]  Your bluff just got called big boy.
[14:59.720 --> 15:02.720]  It just got called in spades.
[15:02.720 --> 15:06.720]  And so the transcripts, I've been given information
[15:06.720 --> 15:12.720]  about people that's never been wrong.
[15:12.720 --> 15:16.720]  Just like I told you six months ago, Hillary is planning to run again.
[15:16.720 --> 15:19.720]  The whole DNC has been told she's going to run Michelle Obama.
[15:19.720 --> 15:20.720]  People said that's crazy.
[15:20.720 --> 15:22.720]  Now it's all over the news.
[15:22.720 --> 15:27.720]  Because I know people that were in the room who came repeatedly
[15:27.720 --> 15:29.720]  and said, why aren't you saying this on air, buddy?
[15:29.720 --> 15:30.720]  We're giving you the big story.
[15:30.720 --> 15:31.720]  We want this on air.
[15:31.720 --> 15:32.720]  Put it on air.
[15:32.720 --> 15:33.720]  I'll put it on air.
[15:33.720 --> 15:35.720]  The point is there's not just bad people in government.
[15:35.720 --> 15:36.720]  There's good people too.
[15:36.720 --> 15:39.720]  It's all coming down now.
[15:39.720 --> 15:40.720]  The gloves are off.
[15:40.720 --> 15:42.720]  Trump's preparing all of it.
[15:42.720 --> 15:43.720]  Every damn bit of it.
[15:43.720 --> 15:47.720]  It's going to be on senators, congressmen, governors.
[15:47.720 --> 15:48.720]  You guys want it?
[15:48.720 --> 15:51.720]  It's all going to start leaking 10,000 times worse than WikiLeaks.
[15:51.720 --> 15:52.720]  Get ready.
[15:52.720 --> 15:54.720]  This country is now in civil war.
[15:54.720 --> 15:58.720]  Choose which side you're on and I'll show you and stay with us.
[15:58.720 --> 16:02.720]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method
[16:02.720 --> 16:03.720]  to cook food and boil water.
[16:03.720 --> 16:06.720]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove
[16:06.720 --> 16:09.720]  or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[16:09.720 --> 16:12.720]  The Minivan rocket stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove
[16:12.720 --> 16:15.720]  that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[16:15.720 --> 16:17.720]  The Minivan stove is easy to use,
[16:17.720 --> 16:19.720]  smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.
[16:19.720 --> 16:21.720]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves

[16:40.720 --> 16:43.720]  which utilizes ordinary table salt as ammunition.

[20:28.720 --> 20:31.720]  I'm here live, the war room comes up 3 o'clock every day
[20:31.720 --> 20:35.720]  with my great compadre and friend,
[20:35.720 --> 20:37.720]  Owen Schreuer and Roger Stone.
[20:37.720 --> 20:39.720]  David Knight knocks out of the park every day
[20:39.720 --> 20:41.720]  at 8 a.m. Central.
[20:41.720 --> 20:43.720]  I'm working on a lot of big projects tomorrow
[20:43.720 --> 20:45.720]  and I was set to not be broadcasting here
[20:45.720 --> 20:48.720]  and David Knight's going to be sitting in tomorrow
[20:48.720 --> 20:52.720]  but don't worry, I'll be flying around the office
[20:52.720 --> 20:55.720]  like a little fairy.
[20:55.720 --> 20:57.720]  We're working on all sorts of things
[20:57.720 --> 21:01.720]  and popping in quite a bit.
[21:01.720 --> 21:07.720]  It's been noted by historians, most historians,
[21:07.720 --> 21:09.720]  and I've experienced it myself that when you really get hit
[21:09.720 --> 21:13.720]  by incredibly historic things, earth-shattering things,
[21:13.720 --> 21:15.720]  people don't tend to notice it
[21:15.720 --> 21:18.720]  because we tend to ease into these incredible times,
[21:18.720 --> 21:21.720]  be they bad, be they good, be they nightmarish,
[21:21.720 --> 21:24.720]  be they ugly, be they a mix above,
[21:24.720 --> 21:27.720]  but let me just telegraph again.
[21:27.720 --> 21:29.720]  If you're not getting chills
[21:29.720 --> 21:32.720]  and you can't politically, culturally, spiritually
[21:32.720 --> 21:37.720]  feel and see and smell what's in the air,
[21:37.720 --> 21:39.720]  you need to have a little bit of a gut check
[21:39.720 --> 21:42.720]  because things are crazy
[21:42.720 --> 21:47.720]  and they didn't just take Info Wars
[21:47.720 --> 21:50.720]  off of tens of millions of subscribers on iTunes
[21:50.720 --> 21:53.720]  and billions and billions of views
[21:53.720 --> 21:56.720]  and five, six million subscribers on our YouTube channels.
[21:56.720 --> 21:59.720]  They didn't just take us off over 100 platforms for nothing.
[21:59.720 --> 22:02.720]  They're doing it to everybody now ahead of big events
[22:02.720 --> 22:05.720]  and that's taken out not just Donald John Trump
[22:05.720 --> 22:08.720]  but other Patriot governors and legislators
[22:08.720 --> 22:12.720]  and members of Congress, people like Jim Jordan
[22:12.720 --> 22:17.720]  and also going after other nationalists like Marie LePen
[22:17.720 --> 22:20.720]  and like the new Trumpian leader of Brazil
[22:20.720 --> 22:24.720]  and the Trumpian leader of Italy
[22:24.720 --> 22:26.720]  and the list goes on and on.
[22:26.720 --> 22:29.720]  So this is their big counter-global offense
[22:29.720 --> 22:31.720]  and they're coming after everybody
[22:31.720 --> 22:35.720]  that they think is effective and can rally the people
[22:35.720 --> 22:39.720]  and that's why you mobilizing now more than ever
[22:39.720 --> 22:42.720]  because we all have a tendency, myself included,
[22:42.720 --> 22:45.720]  when we're on air every day or involved every day
[22:45.720 --> 22:47.720]  listening and talking to others
[22:47.720 --> 22:49.720]  that we just get so close to the problem
[22:49.720 --> 22:54.720]  we aren't afraid enough
[22:54.720 --> 22:56.720]  and I'm not saying we should be afraid.
[22:56.720 --> 22:58.720]  I'm saying we're not taking how serious this is.
[22:58.720 --> 22:59.720]  Myself included.
[22:59.720 --> 23:01.720]  I get so close to this stuff
[23:01.720 --> 23:05.720]  that I catch myself having absolutely no fear
[23:05.720 --> 23:06.720]  and that's not good.
[23:06.720 --> 23:09.720]  I need to remind myself to get really focused
[23:09.720 --> 23:11.720]  and really serious because this is dangerous
[23:11.720 --> 23:15.720]  and the word's not even fear.
[23:15.720 --> 23:18.720]  It's concern and focus and frostiness
[23:18.720 --> 23:20.720]  where we need to really pull back
[23:20.720 --> 23:22.720]  and realize what the chips are,
[23:22.720 --> 23:24.720]  what the steaks are here
[23:24.720 --> 23:26.720]  and you really have that gut check.
[23:26.720 --> 23:29.720]  You get some hardcore chills for a long time
[23:29.720 --> 23:31.720]  and that's your brain getting in line
[23:31.720 --> 23:33.720]  with your spirit and your gut
[23:33.720 --> 23:36.720]  and starts the wheels turning
[23:36.720 --> 23:38.720]  to decide what needs to be done
[23:38.720 --> 23:40.720]  and what we're going to do
[23:40.720 --> 23:43.720]  and if this happens what we're going to do
[23:43.720 --> 23:45.720]  and if that happens what they're going to do
[23:45.720 --> 23:47.720]  and we've got our offensive plan,
[23:47.720 --> 23:49.720]  we've also got our defensive plans
[23:49.720 --> 23:52.720]  and we've got wheels within wheels.
[23:52.720 --> 23:54.720]  But this is it.
[23:54.720 --> 23:57.720]  Trump did not want to put all the establishment in prison
[23:57.720 --> 23:59.720]  because he knew it would make them fight for their lives
[23:59.720 --> 24:04.720]  and it would make it harder to just get them out of the way.
[24:04.720 --> 24:07.720]  But now they're trying to destroy the country and him
[24:07.720 --> 24:09.720]  even faster so the gloves are off
[24:09.720 --> 24:12.720]  and so metaphysically, culturally, politically,
[24:12.720 --> 24:16.720]  spiritually, economically, everything is going to go haywire.
[24:16.720 --> 24:19.720]  I mean, here's a story that should be our top story.
[24:19.720 --> 24:24.720]  But it's trumped by Trump signaling and confirming
[24:26.720 --> 24:28.720]  in tweets and now in statements
[24:28.720 --> 24:30.720]  that he has devastating information
[24:30.720 --> 24:32.720]  about the Democrats period.
[24:32.720 --> 24:34.720]  It's Hillary's emails,
[24:34.720 --> 24:37.720]  it's all of their corruption, it's them colluding,
[24:37.720 --> 24:40.720]  it's the Jerry Epstein stuff, it's all coming out.
[24:40.720 --> 24:42.720]  And you can tell what Trump's got on them
[24:42.720 --> 24:44.720]  by what they try to cover story.
[24:44.720 --> 24:48.720]  Miami Herald tried to find some connection to Trump and Epstein
[24:48.720 --> 24:51.720]  and they're going after Ivanka Trump for her email,
[24:51.720 --> 24:53.720]  none of it classified, none of it's secret.
[24:53.720 --> 24:55.720]  Comparing that to Hillary,
[24:55.720 --> 24:57.720]  there's smoke streaming for all that.
[24:57.720 --> 25:02.720]  But what's the really big trillion pound enchilada here?
[25:02.720 --> 25:07.720]  Seven interest rate hikes in the last two years,
[25:07.720 --> 25:10.720]  the Fed has signaled five more at least.
[25:10.720 --> 25:13.720]  They didn't do any of that under Obama,
[25:13.720 --> 25:15.720]  knowing it'll kill the economy.
[25:15.720 --> 25:18.720]  And they said, oh, Trump's wrong, it won't hurt the economy,
[25:18.720 --> 25:20.720]  it'll help it if we do this.
[25:20.720 --> 25:22.720]  Now they've done it, it's proven to have hurt it.
[25:22.720 --> 25:25.720]  They're trying to put the brakes on it, the emergency brake.
[25:25.720 --> 25:27.720]  Because if the economy comes back, they know,
[25:27.720 --> 25:29.720]  like Bill Maher said, that you'll understand
[25:29.720 --> 25:31.720]  that Trump's really trying to serve you
[25:31.720 --> 25:33.720]  and doing a good job, and they can't allow that to happen.
[25:33.720 --> 25:36.720]  They can't let Trump and America come back from the dead and win.
[25:36.720 --> 25:37.720]  So they're putting the brakes on,
[25:37.720 --> 25:42.720]  and now they're turning around like they're the good guys,
[25:42.720 --> 25:46.720]  saying Fed warns, it's not federal, it's private, off for banks,
[25:46.720 --> 25:50.720]  warns that a particularly large plunged the stock market price
[25:50.720 --> 25:52.720]  is possible if risk materialized.
[25:52.720 --> 25:55.720]  So they've already set the stage for this.
[25:55.720 --> 25:57.720]  They've already set the signals,
[25:57.720 --> 25:59.720]  the big money's pulling their money out to do this on purpose.
[25:59.720 --> 26:04.720]  Soros is shorting everything out of the side.
[26:04.720 --> 26:06.720]  And now the private fellow reserve comes along
[26:06.720 --> 26:08.720]  to help push America's face under the water again
[26:08.720 --> 26:10.720]  or to hold that pillow over our face
[26:10.720 --> 26:12.720]  until we finally stop struggling.
[26:12.720 --> 26:13.720]  Here's another one.
[26:13.720 --> 26:15.720]  Lots of gloom and doom everywhere.
[26:15.720 --> 26:18.720]  Remember, Obama was just all positive BS news.
[26:18.720 --> 26:22.720]  For the U.S. economy, storm clouds on the horizon.
[26:22.720 --> 26:25.720]  So we have enemies of this country.
[26:25.720 --> 26:27.720]  You know, General Motors got huge bailouts,
[26:27.720 --> 26:30.720]  had record profits, buying back their stock,
[26:30.720 --> 26:32.720]  paying huge bonuses to their executives
[26:32.720 --> 26:35.720]  in the billions of dollars.
[26:35.720 --> 26:37.720]  And then they closed five plants,
[26:37.720 --> 26:40.720]  not because they didn't have business,
[26:40.720 --> 26:42.720]  not because they didn't have orders,
[26:42.720 --> 26:47.720]  but because they're moving those plants to China.
[26:47.720 --> 26:49.720]  To become state run over there.
[26:49.720 --> 26:51.720]  People say, oh, don't be state run over here.
[26:51.720 --> 26:53.720]  We're not state run, but you're an American company.
[26:53.720 --> 26:55.720]  We bailed you out.
[26:55.720 --> 26:57.720]  We need strategic infrastructure.
[26:57.720 --> 27:00.720]  General Motors built a lot of our weapons in major wars.
[27:00.720 --> 27:04.720]  Your ass is going to have major repercussions politically,
[27:04.720 --> 27:07.720]  and we're going to take away all these different incentives for you
[27:07.720 --> 27:08.720]  if you go to China.
[27:08.720 --> 27:10.720]  And then they go, oh, Trump's a thug.
[27:10.720 --> 27:11.720]  No, he's not.
[27:11.720 --> 27:14.720]  He's putting up a shield against the globalist gang
[27:14.720 --> 27:16.720]  raping us for decades.
[27:16.720 --> 27:18.720]  And the average snot-nosed Democrat
[27:18.720 --> 27:20.720]  doesn't even care about their own future.
[27:20.720 --> 27:22.720]  Hell, the average union person
[27:22.720 --> 27:24.720]  wants to piss all over the country in Trump
[27:24.720 --> 27:25.720]  because they're in a cult.
[27:25.720 --> 27:27.720]  They don't even want high-paying jobs.
[27:27.720 --> 27:28.720]  They don't even want a future for their kids.
[27:28.720 --> 27:31.720]  They want to watch TV and believe CNN.
[27:31.720 --> 27:34.720]  Now, that's not all of them, but it's a big percentage of them
[27:34.720 --> 27:37.720]  because a lot of people who are in the unions
[27:37.720 --> 27:40.720]  or in the purple state areas won't stand up for America
[27:40.720 --> 27:43.720]  and speak out to your friends and your neighbors and your family
[27:43.720 --> 27:45.720]  when they get in your face about Trump being bad.
[27:45.720 --> 27:48.720]  You should get in their face and rebuke them
[27:48.720 --> 27:50.720]  because they're idiots
[27:50.720 --> 27:53.720]  and stop being ashamed of this country.
[27:53.720 --> 27:55.720]  All right, I'm going to stop right there.
[27:55.720 --> 27:57.720]  Roger Stone's got biggest losses on Trump
[27:57.720 --> 27:59.720]  taking the gloves off when we come back.
[27:59.720 --> 28:03.720]  Now Mueller's main focus is Trump's phone calls to Stone.
[28:03.720 --> 28:05.720]  I told you the record and all of it,
[28:05.720 --> 28:07.720]  and there's nothing there.
[28:07.720 --> 28:09.720]  Get me the clip, though, of Trump
[28:09.720 --> 28:11.720]  about two months before the campaign ended
[28:11.720 --> 28:13.720]  saying, I don't have the emails.
[28:13.720 --> 28:15.720]  I haven't been talking to Russia.
[28:15.720 --> 28:17.720]  Where are 35,000 missing emails?
[28:17.720 --> 28:19.720]  Russia, if you've got them, release them.
[28:19.720 --> 28:21.720]  Yeah, he's the one committing the crime
[28:21.720 --> 28:23.720]  for the illegal emails and the espionage.
[28:23.720 --> 28:25.720]  Who cares where the emails come from?
[28:25.720 --> 28:27.720]  But they change the subject.
[28:27.720 --> 28:29.720]  Roger Stone is coming up.
[28:29.720 --> 28:31.720]  And please don't forget, this is Economic War.

[29:59.720 --> 30:01.720]  Our grandparents,
[30:01.720 --> 30:03.720]  our great grandparents,
[30:03.720 --> 30:05.720]  they canned food during the fall,
[30:05.720 --> 30:07.720]  so they'd have it during the winter.

[31:07.720 --> 31:09.720]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[31:09.720 --> 31:11.720]  It's a good thing and I've had
[31:11.720 --> 31:13.720]  over the years I've learned a lot about water filtration.
[31:13.720 --> 31:15.720]  I've learned what the best was.
[31:15.720 --> 31:17.720]  Now the Alexa Pure Pro's their
[31:17.720 --> 31:19.720]  biggest, nice, sustainable steel unit
[31:19.720 --> 31:21.720]  that does the most gallons an hour. It's amazing.
[31:21.720 --> 31:23.720]  It cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in,
[31:23.720 --> 31:25.720]  the good minerals. Matt Redhawk and the patriots
[31:25.720 --> 31:27.720]  over at my patriotic supply
[31:27.720 --> 31:29.720]  that have developed these filters
[31:29.720 --> 31:31.720]  ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[31:31.720 --> 31:33.720]  He has a glut of them. He's offering
[31:33.720 --> 31:35.720]  a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[31:35.720 --> 31:37.720]  When it's discounted, it's $200.
[31:37.720 --> 31:39.720]  It's $127.
[31:39.720 --> 31:41.720]  He's selling them to us
[31:41.720 --> 31:43.720]  at cost and we're making
[31:43.720 --> 31:45.720]  $20 something bucks on them.
[31:45.720 --> 31:47.720]  So they're going to sell out very, very quickly.

[33:27.720 --> 33:29.720]  Live from the infowars.com
[33:29.720 --> 33:31.720]  studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:31.720 --> 33:33.720]  Here's what President
[33:33.720 --> 33:35.720]  Trump had to say earlier this morning
[33:35.720 --> 33:37.720]  about his old lawyer,
[33:37.720 --> 33:39.720]  Michael
[33:39.720 --> 33:41.720]  the rat,
[33:41.720 --> 33:43.720]  the flip-flopper Cohen.
[33:43.720 --> 33:45.720]  What he's trying to do
[33:45.720 --> 33:47.720]  because he's a weak person
[33:47.720 --> 33:49.720]  and not a very smart person,
[33:49.720 --> 33:51.720]  is to say,
[33:51.720 --> 33:53.720]  a weak person and not a very smart person.
[33:53.720 --> 33:55.720]  What he's trying to do
[33:55.720 --> 33:57.720]  is end
[33:57.720 --> 33:59.720]  and it's very simple.
[33:59.720 --> 34:01.720]  He's got himself a big prison sentence
[34:01.720 --> 34:03.720]  and he's trying to get a much
[34:03.720 --> 34:05.720]  lesser prison sentence
[34:05.720 --> 34:07.720]  by making up the story. Now here's the thing,
[34:07.720 --> 34:09.720]  even if he was right
[34:09.720 --> 34:11.720]  it doesn't matter because
[34:11.720 --> 34:13.720]  I was allowed
[34:13.720 --> 34:15.720]  to do whatever I wanted during the campaign.
[34:15.720 --> 34:17.720]  I was running my business, a lot of different things
[34:17.720 --> 34:19.720]  during the campaign. So very simply
[34:19.720 --> 34:21.720]  Michael Cohen
[34:21.720 --> 34:23.720]  is lying and he's trying
[34:23.720 --> 34:25.720]  to get a reduced sentence
[34:25.720 --> 34:27.720]  for things that have nothing to do with me.
[34:27.720 --> 34:29.720]  Now,
[34:29.720 --> 34:31.720]  let's be clear.
[34:31.720 --> 34:33.720]  The latest, the
[34:33.720 --> 34:35.720]  sieve, they always say that Robert Mueller
[34:35.720 --> 34:37.720]  has never leaked anything, that's all he does
[34:37.720 --> 34:39.720]  to the corporate media disinformation.
[34:39.720 --> 34:41.720]  Close doors, congressional hearings, you name it.
[34:41.720 --> 34:43.720]  Then he spins them and twists them.
[34:43.720 --> 34:45.720]  They're saying now it's whether Roger Stone
[34:45.720 --> 34:47.720]  ever talked to Trump during the campaign
[34:47.720 --> 34:49.720]  or the state knows he did.
[34:49.720 --> 34:51.720]  He used to be the former head of the campaign
[34:51.720 --> 34:53.720]  and one of his sieve advisors.
[34:53.720 --> 34:55.720]  And then the idea again, did he ever talk to WikiLeaks
[34:55.720 --> 34:57.720]  like that's illegal, but he never did.
[34:57.720 --> 34:59.720]  So Roger's going to pop in
[34:59.720 --> 35:01.720]  because this is all coming
[35:01.720 --> 35:03.720]  to a head right now, but Trump's gotten it
[35:03.720 --> 35:05.720]  from the beginning. Remember Trump,
[35:05.720 --> 35:07.720]  back in the early fall of 2016
[35:07.720 --> 35:09.720]  just months before he got elected,
[35:09.720 --> 35:11.720]  he said, I don't care
[35:11.720 --> 35:13.720]  who got the emails, she's the one with the illegal
[35:13.720 --> 35:15.720]  server, whether they got downloaded,
[35:15.720 --> 35:17.720]  whether they got hacked, if the Russians got them,
[35:17.720 --> 35:19.720]  whoever's got them, release them.
[35:19.720 --> 35:21.720]  She's the one that's hiding stuff.
[35:21.720 --> 35:23.720]  She's the one that bleached them
[35:23.720 --> 35:25.720]  and used hammers on them and had Uma Abedin
[35:25.720 --> 35:27.720]  break a bunch of phones
[35:27.720 --> 35:30.720]  and with hammers, that's obstructing justice.
[35:30.720 --> 35:33.720]  You're committing illegal crimes with the illegal server
[35:33.720 --> 35:35.720]  that you know a bunch of foreign governments are in.
[35:35.720 --> 35:38.720]  You're using as a drop box, you lie to Congress about it.
[35:38.720 --> 35:41.720]  Remember they had hearings for years.
[35:41.720 --> 35:44.720]  Meanwhile, she's breaking them up with hammers.
[35:44.720 --> 35:46.720]  Meanwhile, Mueller's on tarmacs
[35:46.720 --> 35:48.720]  in Russia with uranium.
[35:48.720 --> 35:50.720]  Hillary's getting millions
[35:50.720 --> 35:52.720]  of dollars from the Russians.
[35:52.720 --> 35:54.720]  John Podesta, his brother, all of it.
[35:54.720 --> 35:56.720]  This is crazy.
[35:56.720 --> 35:58.720]  And now it's all
[35:58.720 --> 36:00.720]  coming to a head. They've got 80 plus
[36:00.720 --> 36:02.720]  new investigations coming up on the president
[36:02.720 --> 36:04.720]  and he's got a strike now before all the fake
[36:04.720 --> 36:06.720]  investigations start on January 2nd.
[36:06.720 --> 36:08.720]  Presidents come in on the 20th of January.
[36:08.720 --> 36:10.720]  New Congress is on
[36:10.720 --> 36:12.720]  the 2nd. They're going to hit the ground
[36:12.720 --> 36:14.720]  running with total disinfo.
[36:14.720 --> 36:16.720]  Just like the London Guardian, so desperate they said,
[36:16.720 --> 36:18.720]  why, there's
[36:18.720 --> 36:20.720]  Paul Manafort inside the embassy.
[36:20.720 --> 36:22.720]  Visiting with Julian Assange.
[36:22.720 --> 36:24.720]  Turns out, no passport in England.
[36:24.720 --> 36:26.720]  Wasn't even there those years.
[36:26.720 --> 36:28.720]  None of it's true. It's all fake.
[36:28.720 --> 36:30.720]  And now the Guardian has had to admit,
[36:30.720 --> 36:32.720]  okay, it's probably not true.
[36:32.720 --> 36:34.720]  Just like Joe Bayhard and ABC and all of it said,
[36:34.720 --> 36:36.720]  Flynn's coming out and said he's a Russian agent
[36:36.720 --> 36:38.720]  and Trump's a Russian agent. They're all going to prison.
[36:38.720 --> 36:40.720]  Yay! None of it's true.
[36:40.720 --> 36:42.720]  None of it's true.
[36:42.720 --> 36:44.720]  Jim Acosta told Trump three weeks ago
[36:48.720 --> 36:50.720]  that Trump's in the caravan.
[36:50.720 --> 36:52.720]  He said, there is no caravan. Trump said, yes there is.
[36:52.720 --> 36:54.720]  What are they? Actors?
[36:54.720 --> 36:56.720]  So Acosta just manhandled the woman
[36:56.720 --> 36:58.720]  to change the subject.
[36:58.720 --> 37:00.720]  And the media all lined up to say he didn't touch her.
[37:00.720 --> 37:02.720]  When everybody saw he touched her.
[37:02.720 --> 37:04.720]  This is what they're doing. They tell us
[37:04.720 --> 37:06.720]  that Trump's waging war on reality.
[37:06.720 --> 37:08.720]  Trump is reality.
[37:08.720 --> 37:10.720]  Info wars is reality.
[37:10.720 --> 37:12.720]  Drudge report is reality.
[37:12.720 --> 37:14.720]  We're trying to find reality. We're trying to be truthful.
[37:14.720 --> 37:16.720]  These people lie
[37:16.720 --> 37:18.720]  like they control reality.
[37:18.720 --> 37:20.720]  And it isn't working anymore.
[37:20.720 --> 37:22.720]  So it's all coming to a fetid
[37:22.720 --> 37:24.720]  nasty head right now
[37:24.720 --> 37:26.720]  with what did I tell you?
[37:26.720 --> 37:28.720]  What did I tell you Sunday?
[37:28.720 --> 37:30.720]  What did I tell you Monday?
[37:30.720 --> 37:32.720]  What did I tell you every day?
[37:32.720 --> 37:34.720]  I said, Trump's getting ready to declassify
[37:34.720 --> 37:36.720]  not just the illegal wiretaps
[37:36.720 --> 37:38.720]  and not just the coming line
[37:38.720 --> 37:40.720]  to Congress about it, not just no.
[37:40.720 --> 37:42.720]  They've got everything. They've got Hillary's
[37:42.720 --> 37:44.720]  35,000 emails, everything.
[37:44.720 --> 37:46.720]  I guess I know
[37:46.720 --> 37:48.720]  that the folks in the federal agencies
[37:48.720 --> 37:50.720]  that have all this data have been told
[37:50.720 --> 37:52.720]  okay, produce the transcripts
[37:52.720 --> 37:54.720]  for Congress.
[37:54.720 --> 37:56.720]  And they are now
[37:56.720 --> 37:58.720]  drag netting. They've been drag netting.
[37:58.720 --> 38:00.720]  That's their own NSA system against them.
[38:00.720 --> 38:02.720]  Hoisted on their own spear.
[38:02.720 --> 38:04.720]  It's amazing.
[38:04.720 --> 38:06.720]  So,
[38:06.720 --> 38:08.720]  since I mentioned Joy Behar
[38:08.720 --> 38:10.720]  and Tisha, a new radio listener or viewer,
[38:10.720 --> 38:12.720]  here she is with the fake news
[38:12.720 --> 38:14.720]  that General Flynn said they're all Russian agents.
[38:14.720 --> 38:16.720]  Here it is.
[38:16.720 --> 38:18.720]  Breaking news.
[38:18.720 --> 38:20.720]  Oh my God. Oh, breaking news.
[38:20.720 --> 38:22.720]  ABC News Brian Ross is reporting
[38:22.720 --> 38:24.720]  Michael Flynn promised
[38:24.720 --> 38:26.720]  full cooperation to the Mueller team
[38:26.720 --> 38:28.720]  and is prepared to testify
[38:28.720 --> 38:30.720]  that as a candidate, Donald Trump directed him
[38:30.720 --> 38:32.720]  to make contact with the Russians.
[38:32.720 --> 38:34.720]  Yes!
[38:34.720 --> 38:36.720]  Yay!
[38:36.720 --> 38:38.720]  Our president's a Russian agent.
[38:38.720 --> 38:40.720]  Everything's going to fall apart.
[38:40.720 --> 38:42.720]  You would be really sad if that was even true, but it's not.
[38:42.720 --> 38:44.720]  You're like, yay, screw the country.
[38:44.720 --> 38:46.720]  Wow!
[38:46.720 --> 38:48.720]  And now the Federal Reserve is, we're going to tank the economy.
[38:48.720 --> 38:50.720]  Trump was right. We're going to tank it.
[38:50.720 --> 38:52.720]  Wow. Who is the enemy of this country?
[38:52.720 --> 38:54.720]  It's the elites, ladies and gentlemen.
[38:54.720 --> 38:56.720]  Now, Roger Stone has been all over Fox News.
[38:56.720 --> 38:58.720]  Laura Ingram,
[38:58.720 --> 39:00.720]  Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson,
[39:00.720 --> 39:02.720]  and he's been telling the same story over and over again.
[39:02.720 --> 39:04.720]  Corsi backtracked last night
[39:04.720 --> 39:06.720]  on the one area where
[39:06.720 --> 39:08.720]  he's been changing a story
[39:08.720 --> 39:10.720]  that he created a cover story for Stone
[39:10.720 --> 39:12.720]  just to cover for a Twitter thing
[39:12.720 --> 39:14.720]  saying that Podesta would have his time
[39:14.720 --> 39:16.720]  or Podesta would have their time in the barrel.
[39:16.720 --> 39:18.720]  But what is the point of that
[39:18.720 --> 39:20.720]  when there wasn't an issue for months and months and months later?
[39:20.720 --> 39:22.720]  Why would he have a cover story then?
[39:22.720 --> 39:24.720]  And Corsi says
[39:24.720 --> 39:26.720]  that neither man had contact with WikiLeaks.
[39:26.720 --> 39:28.720]  So, there's no reason to have a cover story either.
[39:28.720 --> 39:30.720]  So,
[39:30.720 --> 39:32.720]  regardless, I was there squeezing Corsi and Stone
[39:32.720 --> 39:34.720]  and sending me emails to WikiLeaks
[39:34.720 --> 39:36.720]  calling them jerks.
[39:36.720 --> 39:38.720]  Well, I want you to come on my show
[39:38.720 --> 39:40.720]  when everybody else is.
[39:40.720 --> 39:42.720]  So, I know. I was there.
[39:42.720 --> 39:44.720]  I know.
[39:44.720 --> 39:46.720]  And
[39:46.720 --> 39:48.720]  the public knows that.
[39:48.720 --> 39:50.720]  But regardless, they change the subject now
[39:50.720 --> 39:52.720]  and are moving the New York Times reports
[39:52.720 --> 39:54.720]  the main focus being Roger Stone's
[39:54.720 --> 39:56.720]  phone conversations
[39:56.720 --> 39:58.720]  with the president.
[39:58.720 --> 40:00.720]  Roger Stone, thanks for joining us for your telephone.
[40:02.720 --> 40:04.720]  Alex, it's great to be here.
[40:04.720 --> 40:06.720]  This is getting really insane.
[40:06.720 --> 40:08.720]  And you know me. I won't just put a good face on something.
[40:08.720 --> 40:10.720]  But I really feel victory in the air.
[40:10.720 --> 40:12.720]  Trump is signaling he's going to release
[40:12.720 --> 40:14.720]  the 35,000 emails,
[40:14.720 --> 40:16.720]  the illegal spying, all this other intel.
[40:16.720 --> 40:18.720]  I mean, I've got it from multiple high-level sources
[40:18.720 --> 40:20.720]  that it's all being prepared
[40:20.720 --> 40:22.720]  and that Trump said, go get them.
[40:22.720 --> 40:24.720]  Everything. Every bit of dirt you got.
[40:24.720 --> 40:26.720]  And, yeah, go ahead.
[40:26.720 --> 40:28.720]  Yeah, it looks to me like the president
[40:28.720 --> 40:30.720]  is holding all the cards.
[40:30.720 --> 40:32.720]  Extraordinary interview yesterday
[40:32.720 --> 40:34.720]  in the New York Post where he basically says
[40:34.720 --> 40:36.720]  just a matter of timing.
[40:36.720 --> 40:38.720]  But it's pretty clear
[40:38.720 --> 40:40.720]  from that tweet that he understands
[40:40.720 --> 40:42.720]  as I guess it was
[40:42.720 --> 40:44.720]  Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones
[40:44.720 --> 40:46.720]  who said, every cop is a criminal.
[40:46.720 --> 40:48.720]  The people doing the investigating here
[40:48.720 --> 40:50.720]  are the actual criminals themselves.
[40:50.720 --> 40:52.720]  They're the ones who sold weapons
[40:52.720 --> 40:54.720]  grade uranium
[40:54.720 --> 40:56.720]  to the Russians.
[40:56.720 --> 40:58.720]  They're the ones who took a giant
[40:58.720 --> 41:00.720]  $143 million bribe from the Russian
[41:00.720 --> 41:02.720]  energy company.
[41:02.720 --> 41:04.720]  They're the ones who used the surveillance
[41:04.720 --> 41:06.720]  capability of the
[41:06.720 --> 41:08.720]  federal government through illegal
[41:08.720 --> 41:10.720]  FISA warrants, which I
[41:10.720 --> 41:12.720]  predicted first here on Info Wars
[41:12.720 --> 41:14.720]  a good two years ago
[41:14.720 --> 41:16.720]  would end up being the Lynch veneer
[41:16.720 --> 41:18.720]  to spy on Donald Trump's campaign.
[41:18.720 --> 41:20.720]  And they used the FBI
[41:20.720 --> 41:22.720]  to infiltrate Donald Trump's campaign
[41:22.720 --> 41:24.720]  in an effort to hijack the
[41:24.720 --> 41:26.720]  2016 election. So it's all turning back
[41:26.720 --> 41:28.720]  on them now.
[41:28.720 --> 41:30.720]  They want to haggle about Roger Stone
[41:30.720 --> 41:32.720]  and Jerry Corsi.
[41:32.720 --> 41:34.720]  The point of this
[41:34.720 --> 41:36.720]  is, of course, it neither one of us had any contact
[41:36.720 --> 41:38.720]  with the Olympics or any advanced
[41:38.720 --> 41:40.720]  copies of anything. It's all lie.
[41:40.720 --> 41:42.720]  It's one big lie
[41:42.720 --> 41:44.720]  designed to distract from their crime.
[41:44.720 --> 41:46.720]  Let's just be honest.
[41:46.720 --> 41:48.720]  People headed for prison.
[41:48.720 --> 41:50.720]  They are the people who need to be investigated.
[41:50.720 --> 41:52.720]  And I'm not saying this to brag about
[41:52.720 --> 41:54.720]  I'm a hot shot and people work for me.
[41:54.720 --> 41:56.720]  But you wanted, you've got a lot of
[41:56.720 --> 41:58.720]  jobs, a lot of gigs, consulting, lobbying
[41:58.720 --> 42:00.720]  media, you were a pay contributor at Fox.
[42:00.720 --> 42:02.720]  You were wanting a job here.
[42:02.720 --> 42:04.720]  And the litmus test was get me
[42:04.720 --> 42:06.720]  WikiLeaks
[42:06.720 --> 42:08.720]  or get me Julian Assange on the air
[42:08.720 --> 42:10.720]  and you got your job. You later got it anyways.
[42:10.720 --> 42:12.720]  You've done a great job. But the point is
[42:12.720 --> 42:14.720]  you were not in contact with Assange. I know
[42:14.720 --> 42:16.720]  I was there.
[42:16.720 --> 42:18.720]  Well, and it's interesting that
[42:18.720 --> 42:20.720]  I identified the guy who was my
[42:20.720 --> 42:22.720]  kind of back channel
[42:22.720 --> 42:24.720]  to Assange as Randy Kredico.
[42:24.720 --> 42:26.720]  He denied it for months.
[42:26.720 --> 42:28.720]  The mainstream media bludgeoned me saying,
[42:28.720 --> 42:30.720]  no, no, he denies it. Stone is lying.
[42:30.720 --> 42:32.720]  Stone is lying. Stone is lying.
[42:32.720 --> 42:34.720]  And then when I produced Stone Cold
[42:34.720 --> 42:36.720]  Truth of It, a series of text messages
[42:36.720 --> 42:38.720]  you notice how you don't even read his name
[42:38.720 --> 42:40.720]  anymore. He's just disappeared from the
[42:40.720 --> 42:42.720]  press. If we bought moved on to the
[42:42.720 --> 42:44.720]  controversy between Roger Stone
[42:44.720 --> 42:46.720]  and Jerry Corsi.
[42:46.720 --> 42:48.720]  You're right about one thing, Alex. I worked a lot
[42:48.720 --> 42:50.720]  of places. I've been in nine presidential
[42:50.720 --> 42:52.720]  campaigns. I worked
[42:52.720 --> 42:54.720]  as a contributor for Fox.
[42:54.720 --> 42:56.720]  Influores is the most fun I've ever
[42:56.720 --> 42:58.720]  had in any job. Well, they're right back.
[42:58.720 --> 43:00.720]  The globalists know
[43:00.720 --> 43:02.720]  that if they suppress the good halogen
[43:02.720 --> 43:04.720]  and pump the environment full of the bad halogens,
[43:04.720 --> 43:06.720]  fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it,
[43:06.720 --> 43:08.720]  that it lowers IQ.
[43:08.720 --> 43:10.720]  It literally dumps the population
[43:10.720 --> 43:12.720]  down. And on our quest
[43:12.720 --> 43:14.720]  to bring our listeners and viewers, the best
[43:14.720 --> 43:16.720]  iodide in the world, we've gone through
[43:16.720 --> 43:18.720]  two permutations.
[43:18.720 --> 43:20.720]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was
[43:20.720 --> 43:22.720]  pretty good, but hard to source, and the
[43:22.720 --> 43:24.720]  globalists tried to block us getting a supply
[43:24.720 --> 43:26.720]  of it. So we discovered deep-earth crystals
[43:26.720 --> 43:28.720]  of pure nascent iodine
[43:28.720 --> 43:30.720]  and brought UX2 that's been incredible.
[43:30.720 --> 43:32.720]  Now, due to the establishment trying to
[43:32.720 --> 43:34.720]  block that, we did more research
[43:34.720 --> 43:36.720]  and secured more of the deep-earth crystals
[43:36.720 --> 43:38.720]  of nascent iodine. But
[43:38.720 --> 43:40.720]  chemists, scientists, and others showed us
[43:40.720 --> 43:42.720]  the research that by combining it with three
[43:42.720 --> 43:44.720]  other compounds, two forms of
[43:44.720 --> 43:46.720]  iodine and vitamin C, it
[43:46.720 --> 43:48.720]  supercharges it and makes it
[43:48.720 --> 43:50.720]  even more bio
[43:50.720 --> 43:52.720]  available. Ladies and gentlemen,
[43:52.720 --> 43:54.720]  you want to research it, you want to see it, it's
[43:54.720 --> 43:56.720]  an incredible discovery. X3
[43:56.720 --> 43:58.720]  now available at M4sLife.com
[43:58.720 --> 44:00.720]  I just want everybody to count the cost here
[44:00.720 --> 44:02.720]  as we enter the last month of
[44:02.720 --> 44:04.720]  2018. And I wanted to thank you
[44:04.720 --> 44:06.720]  for all of your support. And I wanted just to remind
[44:06.720 --> 44:08.720]  you that M4s is perfect, but we're fighting
[44:08.720 --> 44:10.720]  as hard as we can. And without you, we won't be
[44:10.720 --> 44:12.720]  here. And that's why we're having
[44:12.720 --> 44:14.720]  Cyber Monday turned into Cyber Week
[44:14.720 --> 44:16.720]  and it's happening now at M4store.com.
[44:16.720 --> 44:18.720]  The biggest sales ever as we attempt
[44:18.720 --> 44:20.720]  to sell all the great inventory so
[44:20.720 --> 44:22.720]  that we can hopefully be capitalized to fund ourselves
[44:22.720 --> 44:24.720]  at least a few months into next year. I don't
[44:24.720 --> 44:26.720]  have to tell you, we've been under total siege
[44:26.720 --> 44:28.720]  and harassment and attacks. It would take an hour
[44:28.720 --> 44:30.720]  to go over to some of it. So right now
[44:30.720 --> 44:32.720]  at M4store.com, there is the revolution
[44:32.720 --> 44:34.720]  of products that are excellent
[44:34.720 --> 44:36.720]  and the revolution of funding M4 Wars
[44:36.720 --> 44:38.720]  that is now in the absolute
[44:38.720 --> 44:40.720]  thick of the battle
[44:40.720 --> 44:42.720]  fighting for the human spirit and
[44:42.720 --> 44:44.720]  human destiny for my children and your
[44:44.720 --> 44:46.720]  children and all of our shared futures
[44:46.720 --> 44:48.720]  together. M4 Wars will
[44:48.720 --> 44:50.720]  talk about the forbidden taboo subjects.
[44:50.720 --> 44:52.720]  We will stand up for human life
[44:52.720 --> 44:54.720]  and human destiny and we will fight until
[44:54.720 --> 44:56.720]  the end. With your help, humanity has
[44:56.720 --> 44:58.720]  a chance. Again, thank you all for your support.
[44:58.720 --> 45:00.720]  We've taken
[45:00.720 --> 45:02.720]  thousands of years of known research
[45:02.720 --> 45:04.720]  and put it together with our own four years
[45:04.720 --> 45:06.720]  of seeking and testing
[45:06.720 --> 45:08.720]  to find the very best systems that God gave
[45:08.720 --> 45:10.720]  us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[45:10.720 --> 45:12.720]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield
[45:12.720 --> 45:14.720]  Toxic metal and chemical
[45:14.720 --> 45:16.720]  defense support. It's made in the USA.
[45:16.720 --> 45:18.720]  It's filled with known
[45:18.720 --> 45:20.720]  compounds from nature that are
[45:20.720 --> 45:22.720]  absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[45:22.720 --> 45:24.720]  and it supports the M4. It is a
[45:24.720 --> 45:26.720]  classical 360 win. This
[45:26.720 --> 45:28.720]  is the formula that I personally have been
[45:28.720 --> 45:30.720]  taking for over a year and now we believe
[45:30.720 --> 45:32.720]  we have come as close to perfection
[45:32.720 --> 45:34.720]  when it comes to a detoxifier
[45:34.720 --> 45:36.720]  as you can possibly get. You owe it to yourself
[45:36.720 --> 45:38.720]  you owe it to your family and you owe it to
[45:38.720 --> 45:40.720]  the future of this country and the world
[45:40.720 --> 45:42.720]  that Patriots stay as healthy
[45:42.720 --> 45:44.720]  and as clean and as focused as
[45:44.720 --> 45:46.720]  you can be because we need you
[45:46.720 --> 45:48.720]  the remnant of America to
[45:48.720 --> 45:50.720]  reignite those brush fires the next level
[45:50.720 --> 45:52.720]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be
[45:52.720 --> 45:54.720]  thanks to your support and your prayers together
[45:54.720 --> 45:56.720]  we're changing the world. Now it's time to
[45:56.720 --> 45:58.720]  change our bodies with Z Shield
[45:58.720 --> 46:00.720]  InfoWordsLive.com
[46:28.720 --> 46:30.720]  If you still this fight is and why we've been made
[46:30.720 --> 46:32.720]  the main target and if you financially
[46:32.720 --> 46:34.720]  support us and if you spread the word
[46:34.720 --> 46:36.720]  about our articles and videos
[46:36.720 --> 46:38.720]  InfoWords.com we won't just
[46:38.720 --> 46:40.720]  continue to stand up against these
[46:40.720 --> 46:42.720]  brutal scumbags we'll win
[46:42.720 --> 46:44.720]  we have huge sales
[46:44.720 --> 46:46.720]  InfoWords.com right now and we're still able
[46:46.720 --> 46:48.720]  to operate the shopping cart and get stuff
[46:48.720 --> 46:50.720]  shipped out to you despite the fact that we're trying to
[46:50.720 --> 46:52.720]  block our commerce and you're right to the market
[46:52.720 --> 46:54.720]  but if you don't stand up and support us
[46:54.720 --> 46:56.720]  financially as far as the global Spain win
[46:56.720 --> 46:58.720]  this is InfoWords.com with your support
[46:58.720 --> 47:27.720]  I'm counting on you.
[47:28.720 --> 47:30.720]  Here's the headline
[47:30.720 --> 47:32.720]  Trump threatens to declassify
[47:32.720 --> 47:34.720]  devastating documents if the Democrats
[47:34.720 --> 47:36.720]  want to play tough
[47:36.720 --> 47:38.720]  and specifically
[47:38.720 --> 47:40.720]  we've been pushing for two years
[47:40.720 --> 47:42.720]  trying to release the illegal
[47:42.720 --> 47:44.720]  FISA warrants
[47:44.720 --> 47:46.720]  the courts have said it was all done illegally
[47:46.720 --> 47:48.720]  it proves Comey, Mueller, all of them lying
[47:48.720 --> 47:50.720]  to Congress lying to get the warrants
[47:50.720 --> 47:52.720]  it proves it all predates
[47:52.720 --> 47:54.720]  the Russia investigation
[47:54.720 --> 47:56.720]  it proves it all predates
[47:56.720 --> 47:58.720]  the Russia investigation
[48:00.720 --> 48:02.720]  but that's not all Trump's got
[48:02.720 --> 48:04.720]  he's got Hillary's emails
[48:04.720 --> 48:06.720]  there were a whole bunch of countries on that server
[48:06.720 --> 48:08.720]  he's got everything
[48:08.720 --> 48:10.720]  and Trump cannot believe
[48:10.720 --> 48:12.720]  the Federal Reserve's raising interest rates to kill the recovery
[48:12.720 --> 48:14.720]  he cannot believe that even though
[48:14.720 --> 48:16.720]  he's done a great job and America's
[48:16.720 --> 48:18.720]  woken up that they're engaging all this because they're crazy
[48:18.720 --> 48:20.720]  they're megalomaniacs
[48:20.720 --> 48:22.720]  and here's the president
[48:22.720 --> 48:24.720]  26, 27 months ago
[48:24.720 --> 48:26.720]  about three months before the election
[48:26.720 --> 48:28.720]  saying hey, it isn't about
[48:28.720 --> 48:30.720]  who got the emails it's about
[48:30.720 --> 48:32.720]  what's in the illegal activity
[48:32.720 --> 48:34.720]  and the treason of the emails that's the issue
[48:34.720 --> 48:36.720]  but none of that gets prosecuted
[48:36.720 --> 48:38.720]  none of that gets looked at it's incredible
[48:38.720 --> 48:40.720]  here's the president
[48:40.720 --> 48:42.720]  assuming it's Russia or China or one of the major
[48:42.720 --> 48:44.720]  countries and competitors
[48:44.720 --> 48:46.720]  it's a
[48:46.720 --> 48:48.720]  a total sign of disrespect
[48:48.720 --> 48:50.720]  for a country
[48:50.720 --> 48:52.720]  Putin and the leaders
[48:52.720 --> 48:54.720]  without the world have no respect for our country
[48:54.720 --> 48:56.720]  anymore and they certainly have no respect
[48:56.720 --> 48:58.720]  for our leader so I know nothing about it
[48:58.720 --> 49:00.720]  it's one of the most far-fetched I've ever heard
[49:00.720 --> 49:02.720]  yes, what do I have to get involved with
[49:02.720 --> 49:04.720]  Putin for I have nothing to do with Putin
[49:04.720 --> 49:06.720]  I've never spoken to him I don't know anything about him other than
[49:06.720 --> 49:08.720]  he will respect me
[49:08.720 --> 49:10.720]  Russia if you're listening
[49:10.720 --> 49:12.720]  I hope you're able to find
[49:12.720 --> 49:14.720]  the 30,000
[49:14.720 --> 49:16.720]  emails that are missing
[49:16.720 --> 49:18.720]  I think you will probably be
[49:18.720 --> 49:22.720]  rewarded mightily by our press
[49:24.720 --> 49:26.720]  so
[49:26.720 --> 49:28.720]  why run from this
[49:28.720 --> 49:30.720]  WikiLeaks isn't Russian it's Hillary's emails
[49:30.720 --> 49:32.720]  it's what she did but they have changed
[49:32.720 --> 49:34.720]  the subject onto this but now
[49:34.720 --> 49:36.720]  Trump's ready to change it back
[49:36.720 --> 49:38.720]  now I've got my sources Roger you've got your sources
[49:38.720 --> 49:40.720]  can you get into your sources and Trump
[49:40.720 --> 49:42.720]  getting ready to take the gloves off
[49:42.720 --> 49:44.720]  and what's coming next not just from
[49:44.720 --> 49:46.720]  our side the American side
[49:46.720 --> 49:48.720]  but from the deep state they're not
[49:48.720 --> 49:50.720]  going to give up is it accurate with the New York Times
[49:50.720 --> 49:52.720]  and others said the new focus is on
[49:52.720 --> 49:54.720]  Trump's phone calls with you
[49:54.720 --> 49:56.720]  as if that's bad now
[49:56.720 --> 49:58.720]  as if the campaign
[49:58.720 --> 50:00.720]  as if the candidate
[50:00.720 --> 50:02.720]  isn't allowed to talk to you now that's the new evil
[50:02.720 --> 50:04.720]  well I guess what they're trying
[50:04.720 --> 50:06.720]  to say is that
[50:06.720 --> 50:08.720]  there's an email which is
[50:08.720 --> 50:10.720]  innocuous between Dr. Corsi
[50:10.720 --> 50:12.720]  and I which Corsi
[50:12.720 --> 50:14.720]  predicts that WikiLeaks
[50:14.720 --> 50:16.720]  is going to be releasing material
[50:16.720 --> 50:18.720]  in October
[50:18.720 --> 50:20.720]  he would be about the 10,000
[50:20.720 --> 50:22.720]  funded to predict that
[50:22.720 --> 50:24.720]  and two days later there's
[50:24.720 --> 50:26.720]  a record that I spoke to Donald Trump
[50:26.720 --> 50:28.720]  on the telephone
[50:28.720 --> 50:30.720]  but one does not prove the other in other words
[50:30.720 --> 50:32.720]  the Washington Post reporter I spoke
[50:32.720 --> 50:34.720]  to yesterday but you must
[50:34.720 --> 50:36.720]  have talked about this except for I didn't
[50:36.720 --> 50:38.720]  but you must have but I didn't
[50:38.720 --> 50:40.720]  and he starts to sound like you said
[50:40.720 --> 50:42.720]  everyone on earth
[50:42.720 --> 50:44.720]  and then this is particularly rich
[50:44.720 --> 50:46.720]  watching CNN last night
[50:46.720 --> 50:48.720]  Wolf Blitzer
[50:48.720 --> 50:50.720]  who I gotta tell you the worst breath you've ever
[50:50.720 --> 50:52.720]  spelled bad dandruff
[50:52.720 --> 50:54.720]  mangy looking beard
[50:54.720 --> 50:56.720]  mean spirited guy
[50:56.720 --> 50:58.720]  who smells vaguely like sulfur
[50:58.720 --> 51:00.720]  trying to conflate
[51:00.720 --> 51:02.720]  Hillary's missing emails
[51:02.720 --> 51:04.720]  with the emails released
[51:04.720 --> 51:06.720]  by WikiLeaks
[51:06.720 --> 51:08.720]  those are apples and oranges they have
[51:08.720 --> 51:10.720]  no relationship to each other
[51:10.720 --> 51:12.720]  these missing emails have never
[51:12.720 --> 51:14.720]  been found unless of course
[51:14.720 --> 51:16.720]  as you say the president has them
[51:16.720 --> 51:18.720]  which he may very well now have them
[51:18.720 --> 51:20.720]  but Hillary erased them for some reason
[51:20.720 --> 51:22.720]  the reason I would speculate
[51:22.720 --> 51:24.720]  is that they probably show evidence
[51:24.720 --> 51:26.720]  of criminal activity
[51:26.720 --> 51:28.720]  and treasonous activity
[51:28.720 --> 51:30.720]  well the president
[51:30.720 --> 51:32.720]  tweeted as you know yesterday morning
[51:32.720 --> 51:34.720]  it's topofnewswars.com
[51:34.720 --> 51:36.720]  topofdrudgerport.com
[51:36.720 --> 51:38.720]  the image we can pull that back up
[51:38.720 --> 51:40.720]  from the time of TV viewers
[51:40.720 --> 51:42.720]  of the entire gaggle
[51:42.720 --> 51:44.720]  of deep state captains and generals
[51:44.720 --> 51:46.720]  from Marbert Mueller to Hillary Clinton
[51:46.720 --> 51:48.720]  to Bill Clinton to Loretta Lynch
[51:48.720 --> 51:50.720]  to James Comey
[51:50.720 --> 51:52.720]  all of them behind bars and he said
[51:52.720 --> 51:54.720]  now that the Russia thing has been proven to be a hoax
[51:54.720 --> 51:56.720]  when do we have the treason trials to start
[51:56.720 --> 51:58.720]  that was a major signal
[51:58.720 --> 52:00.720]  until what the signal was then today
[52:00.720 --> 52:02.720]  Donald Trump threatens to declassify
[52:02.720 --> 52:04.720]  devastating documents about democrats
[52:04.720 --> 52:06.720]  says if you want to play cuff it's time
[52:06.720 --> 52:08.720]  for the mountains of crime
[52:08.720 --> 52:10.720]  why are they so
[52:10.720 --> 52:12.720]  chutzpah bravada
[52:12.720 --> 52:14.720]  hubris filled
[52:14.720 --> 52:16.720]  I mean what are these people's problems
[52:16.720 --> 52:18.720]  Trump really left them alone
[52:18.720 --> 52:20.720]  for a while hoping they just go away
[52:20.720 --> 52:22.720]  and even tried to share power a bit
[52:22.720 --> 52:24.720]  if they would just get out of the way of the country
[52:24.720 --> 52:26.720]  and not have a hard on to screw the nation
[52:26.720 --> 52:28.720]  but they can't stop
[52:28.720 --> 52:30.720]  they can't stop Roger
[52:30.720 --> 52:32.720]  I think you have to recognize that from the beginning
[52:32.720 --> 52:34.720]  these career politicians
[52:34.720 --> 52:36.720]  they understand the ground
[52:36.720 --> 52:38.720]  they understand the system better
[52:38.720 --> 52:40.720]  I mean Donald Trump is a great man
[52:40.720 --> 52:42.720]  but he's a real estate developer
[52:42.720 --> 52:44.720]  he's a strong leader
[52:44.720 --> 52:46.720]  he gets the big picture
[52:46.720 --> 52:48.720]  but that doesn't mean he knew the nuances
[52:48.720 --> 52:50.720]  of how the federal bureaucracy works
[52:50.720 --> 52:52.720]  at all levels
[52:52.720 --> 52:54.720]  so they played the game against him
[52:54.720 --> 52:56.720]  and then of course
[52:56.720 --> 52:58.720]  Reince Priebus convinced him
[52:58.720 --> 53:00.720]  to appoint a traitor
[53:00.720 --> 53:02.720]  Rod Rosenstein as the
[53:02.720 --> 53:04.720]  no one knew that Jeff Sessions
[53:04.720 --> 53:06.720]  was going to take a dive
[53:06.720 --> 53:08.720]  and recuse himself
[53:08.720 --> 53:10.720]  that put the deep state
[53:10.720 --> 53:12.720]  that put James Comey and Robert Mueller's
[53:12.720 --> 53:14.720]  best friend
[53:14.720 --> 53:16.720]  in charge of Donald Trump's Justice Department
[53:16.720 --> 53:18.720]  so right now the Justice Department
[53:18.720 --> 53:20.720]  until the appointment of Matthew Whitaker
[53:20.720 --> 53:22.720]  who I think is a good man
[53:22.720 --> 53:24.720]  the acting attorney general
[53:24.720 --> 53:26.720]  was in the hands of the enemy
[53:26.720 --> 53:28.720]  was in the hands of those aligned with Bill and Hillary Clinton
[53:28.720 --> 53:30.720]  and Robert Mueller and those
[53:30.720 --> 53:32.720]  committed to covering up their crimes
[53:32.720 --> 53:34.720]  this isn't just an effort
[53:34.720 --> 53:36.720]  to take down the president
[53:36.720 --> 53:38.720]  this is also a defensive effort
[53:38.720 --> 53:40.720]  they understand their deep criminality
[53:40.720 --> 53:42.720]  and therefore they had to move on Trump
[53:42.720 --> 53:44.720]  before he figured out how to move on them
[53:44.720 --> 53:46.720]  unfortunately he's now figured it out
[53:46.720 --> 53:48.720]  and let's be clear
[53:48.720 --> 53:50.720]  they're all blackmailing each other
[53:50.720 --> 53:52.720]  and so that's why
[53:52.720 --> 53:54.720]  they have this desperateness to them
[53:54.720 --> 53:56.720]  because it is about their survival
[53:56.720 --> 53:58.720]  and if you expand on that
[53:58.720 --> 54:00.720]  they know just like Hollywood's going down
[54:00.720 --> 54:02.720]  from all the blackmail
[54:02.720 --> 54:04.720]  as Hollywood loses power
[54:04.720 --> 54:06.720]  they can't pay people off anymore
[54:06.720 --> 54:08.720]  and so more and more people then demand a larger
[54:08.720 --> 54:10.720]  and larger ransom
[54:10.720 --> 54:12.720]  so that's also part of the overall sickness in DC
[54:12.720 --> 54:14.720]  of why they want to keep expanding their own
[54:14.720 --> 54:16.720]  government and corporate bubble
[54:16.720 --> 54:18.720]  that the expense of all of us
[54:18.720 --> 54:20.720]  is because they're like heroin addicts
[54:20.720 --> 54:22.720]  they're totally addicted to the next fix
[54:22.720 --> 54:24.720]  but what they have to understand is
[54:24.720 --> 54:26.720]  there are bigger movements in history
[54:26.720 --> 54:28.720]  that can't be stopped
[54:28.720 --> 54:30.720]  and remember
[54:30.720 --> 54:32.720]  26 months ago they were saying
[54:32.720 --> 54:34.720]  Trump won't even get seated as the president
[54:34.720 --> 54:36.720]  the delegates won't step forward
[54:36.720 --> 54:38.720]  and so there was a lot of
[54:38.720 --> 54:40.720]  fear by people
[54:40.720 --> 54:42.720]  who wanted to ride the fence
[54:42.720 --> 54:44.720]  who thought well if he does get in he'll be out soon
[54:44.720 --> 54:46.720]  and so a lot of people became double agents
[54:46.720 --> 54:48.720]  against Trump then got compromised
[54:48.720 --> 54:50.720]  and are now being ordered to continue to sabotage
[54:50.720 --> 54:52.720]  the agenda
[54:52.720 --> 54:54.720]  because they think they don't have a choice
[54:54.720 --> 54:56.720]  they should come out of the cold
[54:56.720 --> 54:58.720]  they should go to the president
[54:58.720 --> 55:00.720]  they should go to the congress
[55:00.720 --> 55:02.720]  they should go to the republican leadership
[55:02.720 --> 55:04.720]  they're a lot better than they used to be
[55:04.720 --> 55:06.720]  and they should all just go public and end this now Roger
[55:06.720 --> 55:08.720]  I couldn't agree more Alex
[55:08.720 --> 55:10.720]  I mean the president is holding all the cards
[55:10.720 --> 55:12.720]  I honestly think the one missing piece here
[55:12.720 --> 55:14.720]  is he needs an honest FBI director
[55:14.720 --> 55:16.720]  Christopher Ray
[55:16.720 --> 55:18.720]  is part of the
[55:18.720 --> 55:20.720]  two-party duopoly
[55:20.720 --> 55:22.720]  and part of the political establishment
[55:22.720 --> 55:24.720]  to covering up the crimes of the FBI
[55:24.720 --> 55:26.720]  I think the president needs an FBI director
[55:26.720 --> 55:28.720]  wasn't recommended
[55:28.720 --> 55:30.720]  by the deep establishment
[55:30.720 --> 55:32.720]  but who is loyal to Donald Trump
[55:32.720 --> 55:34.720]  someone like former New York police commissioner Ray Telly
[55:34.720 --> 55:36.720]  for example
[55:36.720 --> 55:38.720]  who I know to be a true patriot
[55:38.720 --> 55:40.720]  and somebody who's against the globalists
[55:40.720 --> 55:42.720]  that's one kind of
[55:42.720 --> 55:44.720]  problem area
[55:44.720 --> 55:46.720]  that I see because ultimately
[55:46.720 --> 55:48.720]  the president is going to have to order the arrests
[55:48.720 --> 55:50.720]  of dozens and dozens of people
[55:50.720 --> 55:52.720]  and he's going to need people
[55:52.720 --> 55:54.720]  within his government
[55:54.720 --> 55:56.720]  who will carry out those instructions
[55:56.720 --> 55:58.720]  and by the way just because that hasn't happened yet
[55:58.720 --> 56:00.720]  in decades
[56:00.720 --> 56:02.720]  is because the swamps been entrenched
[56:02.720 --> 56:04.720]  they're freaking out because that's where Trump's going
[56:04.720 --> 56:06.720]  and he said that's where he's going
[56:06.720 --> 56:08.720]  and he knows now they're not going to back off
[56:08.720 --> 56:10.720]  they're like mad dogs and so it's time to pray for Trump
[56:10.720 --> 56:12.720]  pray for America
[56:12.720 --> 56:14.720]  pray for Roger Stone
[56:14.720 --> 56:16.720]  pray for him for war, pray for me
[56:16.720 --> 56:18.720]  I need the prayers and realize
[56:18.720 --> 56:20.720]  I need to be active
[56:20.720 --> 56:22.720]  get outspoken more than ever
[56:22.720 --> 56:24.720]  this is more important right now
[56:24.720 --> 56:26.720]  than the 2016 election
[56:26.720 --> 56:28.720]  the 2018 election
[56:28.720 --> 56:30.720]  now we're going into the main
[56:30.720 --> 56:32.720]  fight here
[56:32.720 --> 56:34.720]  politically and economically and culturally
[56:34.720 --> 56:36.720]  Roger Stone will keep tracking all this as it unfolds
[56:36.720 --> 56:38.720]  Godspeed my friend
[56:38.720 --> 56:40.720]  many thanks Alex God bless you
[56:40.720 --> 56:42.720]  God bless you
[56:42.720 --> 56:44.720]  okay I'm going to do a one minute plug here
[56:44.720 --> 56:46.720]  and it's real simple
[56:46.720 --> 56:48.720]  we'll be strong and be able to go into the future
[56:48.720 --> 56:50.720]  and beat the attacks they've launched against us
[56:50.720 --> 56:52.720]  which are substantive
[56:52.720 --> 56:54.720]  but because you have been so amazing
[56:54.720 --> 56:56.720]  praying for us, spreading the word
[56:56.720 --> 56:58.720]  buying the products, telling folks about local radio stations
[56:58.720 --> 57:00.720]  and TV stations
[57:00.720 --> 57:02.720]  we have stood the test of time
[57:02.720 --> 57:04.720]  an incredible onslaught
[57:04.720 --> 57:06.720]  but we need your support
[57:06.720 --> 57:08.720]  and we make it easy
[57:08.720 --> 57:10.720]  these are the biggest specials we've ever had
[57:10.720 --> 57:12.720]  I'm going to pretty much continue them
[57:12.720 --> 57:14.720]  through till Christmas
[57:14.720 --> 57:16.720]  Cyber Week
[57:16.720 --> 57:18.720]  is going to end next Monday
[57:18.720 --> 57:20.720]  because a lot of the products are going to sell out
[57:20.720 --> 57:22.720]  so when I say I'm going to continue specials
[57:22.720 --> 57:24.720]  on things that we have, we're going to sell everything out
[57:24.720 --> 57:26.720]  this year in the inventory, we've never done that before
[57:26.720 --> 57:28.720]  to try to get the capital we need in
[57:28.720 --> 57:30.720]  even though they're able to shut down our merchant accounts
[57:30.720 --> 57:32.720]  and our shopping carts into the new year
[57:32.720 --> 57:34.720]  which they're trying to do
[57:34.720 --> 57:36.720]  we will have some funds into the future
[57:36.720 --> 57:38.720]  so we need your support now

[58:14.720 --> 58:16.720]  we will be shut down
[58:16.720 --> 58:18.720]  we make it easy to do
[58:18.720 --> 58:20.720]  we've got Cyber Week going right now

[58:32.720 --> 58:34.720]  and I want to ask you for your continued support

[1:00:16.720 --> 1:00:18.720]  and so evil and so possessed
[1:00:18.720 --> 1:00:20.720]  that they are having nightmares
[1:00:20.720 --> 1:00:22.720]  they're freaking out
[1:00:22.720 --> 1:00:24.720]  hopefully they say listen
[1:00:24.720 --> 1:00:26.720]  Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur
[1:00:26.720 --> 1:00:40.720]  whiskey bottles and brand new cars
[1:00:40.720 --> 1:00:44.720]  look what's going on inside you
[1:00:44.720 --> 1:01:00.720]  I have two words for you
[1:01:00.720 --> 1:01:16.720]  there's a guy on the radio
[1:01:16.720 --> 1:01:32.720]  and a guy on the radio
[1:01:32.720 --> 1:01:38.720]  defending the republic from enemies
[1:01:38.720 --> 1:01:40.720]  foreign and domestic
[1:01:40.720 --> 1:01:44.720]  it's Alex Jones
[1:01:44.720 --> 1:01:46.720]  ladies and gentlemen the fight is on
[1:01:46.720 --> 1:01:48.720]  it's Thursday the 29th of November 2018
[1:01:48.720 --> 1:01:50.720]  Will Johnson
[1:01:50.720 --> 1:01:52.720]  great independent journalist
[1:01:52.720 --> 1:01:54.720]  also does some work with Infowars
[1:01:54.720 --> 1:01:56.720]  going to be joining us coming up in the next segment
[1:01:56.720 --> 1:01:58.720]  to cover all the big incredible developments
[1:01:58.720 --> 1:02:00.720]  we're also going to look at after banning Alex Jones
[1:02:00.720 --> 1:02:02.720]  YouTube still hosts race hate supremacist
[1:02:02.720 --> 1:02:04.720]  David Duke and Farrakhan
[1:02:04.720 --> 1:02:06.720]  I want to be clear
[1:02:06.720 --> 1:02:08.720]  I'm not calling for censoring either one of these men
[1:02:08.720 --> 1:02:10.720]  I'm only pointing out why is ISIS and Al Qaeda
[1:02:10.720 --> 1:02:12.720]  and all these groups still on YouTube
[1:02:12.720 --> 1:02:14.720]  the answer is they are divisive
[1:02:14.720 --> 1:02:16.720]  we'll be right back after this important point
[1:02:16.720 --> 1:02:18.720]  what he's trying to do
[1:02:18.720 --> 1:02:20.720]  because he's a weak person
[1:02:20.720 --> 1:02:22.720]  and not a very smart person
[1:02:22.720 --> 1:02:24.720]  what he's trying to do is end
[1:02:24.720 --> 1:02:26.720]  and it's very simple
[1:02:26.720 --> 1:02:28.720]  he's got himself a big prison sentence
[1:02:28.720 --> 1:02:30.720]  and he's trying to get
[1:02:30.720 --> 1:02:32.720]  a much lesser prison sentence
[1:02:32.720 --> 1:02:34.720]  by making up the story
[1:02:34.720 --> 1:02:36.720]  now here's the thing
[1:02:36.720 --> 1:02:38.720]  even if he was right it doesn't matter
[1:02:38.720 --> 1:02:40.720]  because I was allowed
[1:02:40.720 --> 1:02:42.720]  to do whatever I wanted during the campaign
[1:02:42.720 --> 1:02:44.720]  I was running my business
[1:02:44.720 --> 1:02:46.720]  a lot of different things during the campaign
[1:02:46.720 --> 1:02:48.720]  so very simply
[1:02:48.720 --> 1:02:50.720]  Michael Cohn is lying
[1:02:50.720 --> 1:02:52.720]  and he's trying to get a reduced
[1:02:52.720 --> 1:02:54.720]  sentence for things that have nothing to do with me
[1:02:54.720 --> 1:02:56.720]  now let's
[1:02:56.720 --> 1:02:58.720]  now that's Trump talking about
[1:02:58.720 --> 1:03:00.720]  one of his former lawyers who said
[1:03:00.720 --> 1:03:02.720]  Trump was not involved with the Russians
[1:03:02.720 --> 1:03:04.720]  there were no meetings but now that he's been charged
[1:03:04.720 --> 1:03:06.720]  with money laundering $15 million
[1:03:06.720 --> 1:03:08.720]  separate from Trump
[1:03:08.720 --> 1:03:10.720]  there are members all this
[1:03:10.720 --> 1:03:12.720]  but we're going to go to break him up with Will Johnson
[1:03:12.720 --> 1:03:14.720]  first a few minutes from another Greg Rees report
[1:03:14.720 --> 1:03:16.720]  they're out in California at the border
[1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:18.720]  covering the caravan that's set to attack
[1:03:18.720 --> 1:03:20.720]  for the second time today
[1:03:20.720 --> 1:03:22.720]  or tomorrow
[1:03:22.720 --> 1:03:24.720]  and the numbers have masked much greater there
[1:03:24.720 --> 1:03:26.720]  but up on infowars.com we have the full report
[1:03:26.720 --> 1:03:28.720]  here's part of it
[1:03:28.720 --> 1:03:30.720]  what students at SDU think about the migrant caravan
[1:03:30.720 --> 1:03:32.720]  here it is
[1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:34.720]  it's Wednesday November 28th 2018
[1:03:34.720 --> 1:03:36.720]  we are here at the University of San Diego
[1:03:36.720 --> 1:03:38.720]  today asking students
[1:03:38.720 --> 1:03:40.720]  how they feel about the migrant caravan
[1:03:40.720 --> 1:03:42.720]  it's a conflict that
[1:03:42.720 --> 1:03:44.720]  we saw coming
[1:03:44.720 --> 1:03:46.720]  I think it's unfortunately necessary
[1:03:46.720 --> 1:03:48.720]  to be able to get to the next step
[1:03:48.720 --> 1:03:50.720]  which is solving that problem
[1:03:50.720 --> 1:03:52.720]  I think that anybody who desires to come over here
[1:03:52.720 --> 1:03:54.720]  should be allowed to come over here
[1:03:54.720 --> 1:03:56.720]  I think we definitely shouldn't be able to
[1:03:56.720 --> 1:03:58.720]  step in
[1:03:58.720 --> 1:04:00.720]  and stop a right that's been
[1:04:00.720 --> 1:04:02.720]  allowed for
[1:04:02.720 --> 1:04:04.720]  and then pay for all the welfare
[1:04:04.720 --> 1:04:06.720]  actually
[1:04:06.720 --> 1:04:08.720]  so I mean
[1:04:08.720 --> 1:04:10.720]  I feel bad for
[1:04:10.720 --> 1:04:12.720]  people from the southern part of Mexico
[1:04:12.720 --> 1:04:14.720]  that are
[1:04:14.720 --> 1:04:16.720]  out there in Tijuana
[1:04:16.720 --> 1:04:18.720]  without food or anything
[1:04:18.720 --> 1:04:20.720]  and they feel hopeless
[1:04:20.720 --> 1:04:22.720]  and I don't know if the right solution
[1:04:22.720 --> 1:04:24.720]  is for them to immigrate to the US
[1:04:24.720 --> 1:04:26.720]  because the US has its problems of its own
[1:04:26.720 --> 1:04:28.720]  but their situation
[1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:30.720]  is very bad for sure
[1:04:30.720 --> 1:04:32.720]  it's a difficult situation that they're having
[1:04:32.720 --> 1:04:34.720]  because they brought so much violence
[1:04:34.720 --> 1:04:36.720]  it's actually really close to my hometown
[1:04:36.720 --> 1:04:38.720]  it's happening so my hometown's a border town
[1:04:38.720 --> 1:04:40.720]  it's like five minutes away practically
[1:04:40.720 --> 1:04:42.720]  it's in Mexicali and it's not as severe
[1:04:42.720 --> 1:04:44.720]  as it is here in 2J but I think it's still
[1:04:44.720 --> 1:04:46.720]  a big issue that's going on
[1:04:46.720 --> 1:04:48.720]  and we have to learn how to deal with it
[1:04:48.720 --> 1:04:50.720]  in a better way because I don't think throwing gases at people
[1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:52.720]  is civilized
[1:04:52.720 --> 1:04:54.720]  I don't think it's right for them to use tear gas
[1:04:54.720 --> 1:04:56.720]  to push them on
[1:04:58.720 --> 1:05:00.720]  I just want everybody to count the cost here
[1:05:00.720 --> 1:05:02.720]  at the end of the last month of 2018
[1:05:02.720 --> 1:05:04.720]  and I want to thank you for all of your support
[1:05:04.720 --> 1:05:06.720]  and I want to just to remind you
[1:05:06.720 --> 1:05:08.720]  that M4s isn't perfect but we're fighting as hard as we can
[1:05:08.720 --> 1:05:10.720]  and without you we won't be here
[1:05:10.720 --> 1:05:12.720]  and that's why we're having Cyber Monday
[1:05:12.720 --> 1:05:14.720]  turn into Cyber Week and it's happening now
[1:05:14.720 --> 1:05:16.720]  at m4store.com
[1:05:16.720 --> 1:05:18.720]  the biggest sales ever as we attempt to sell
[1:05:18.720 --> 1:05:20.720]  all the great inventory so that we can hopefully
[1:05:20.720 --> 1:05:22.720]  be capitalized to fund ourselves at least
[1:05:22.720 --> 1:05:24.720]  a few months into next year I don't have to tell you
[1:05:24.720 --> 1:05:26.720]  we've been under total siege and harassment
[1:05:26.720 --> 1:05:28.720]  and attacks it would take an hour to go over
[1:05:28.720 --> 1:05:30.720]  some of it so right now
[1:05:30.720 --> 1:05:32.720]  at m4store.com there is the revolution
[1:05:32.720 --> 1:05:34.720]  of products that are excellent
[1:05:34.720 --> 1:05:36.720]  and the revolution of funding info wars
[1:05:36.720 --> 1:05:38.720]  that is now in the absolute
[1:05:38.720 --> 1:05:40.720]  thick of the battle
[1:05:40.720 --> 1:05:42.720]  fighting for the human spirit and human destiny
[1:05:42.720 --> 1:05:44.720]  for my children and your children
[1:05:44.720 --> 1:05:46.720]  and all of our shared futures together
[1:05:46.720 --> 1:05:48.720]  info wars will talk
[1:05:48.720 --> 1:05:50.720]  about the forbidden taboo subjects
[1:05:50.720 --> 1:05:52.720]  we will stand up for human life and human destiny
[1:05:52.720 --> 1:05:54.720]  and we will fight until the end
[1:05:54.720 --> 1:05:56.720]  with your help humanity has a chance
[1:05:56.720 --> 1:05:58.720]  again thank you all for your support
[1:06:26.720 --> 1:06:28.720]  waging war
[1:06:28.720 --> 1:06:30.720]  on corruption
[1:06:30.720 --> 1:06:32.720]  it's Alex Jones
[1:06:34.720 --> 1:06:36.720]  ladies and gentlemen
[1:06:36.720 --> 1:06:38.720]  we are living in
[1:06:38.720 --> 1:06:40.720]  incredibly epic times
[1:06:40.720 --> 1:06:42.720]  multinational
[1:06:42.720 --> 1:06:44.720]  corporations working with communist china
[1:06:44.720 --> 1:06:46.720]  the unelected EU and others
[1:06:46.720 --> 1:06:48.720]  with the america
[1:06:48.720 --> 1:06:50.720]  hating operating system of hollywood
[1:06:50.720 --> 1:06:52.720]  had pretty much taken control of this nation
[1:06:52.720 --> 1:06:54.720]  were in the final phases of bankrupting us
[1:06:54.720 --> 1:06:56.720]  financially
[1:06:56.720 --> 1:06:58.720]  but also bankrupting us spiritually
[1:06:58.720 --> 1:07:00.720]  and breaking our will
[1:07:00.720 --> 1:07:02.720]  and that fight is still ongoing we haven't turned them back yet
[1:07:02.720 --> 1:07:04.720]  but we are in the fight now so at least we are fighting back
[1:07:04.720 --> 1:07:06.720]  the sleeping giant is at least
[1:07:06.720 --> 1:07:08.720]  partially awake
[1:07:08.720 --> 1:07:10.720]  trump has all the classified documents
[1:07:10.720 --> 1:07:12.720]  he has all the nsa
[1:07:12.720 --> 1:07:14.720]  data dumps
[1:07:14.720 --> 1:07:16.720]  he knows about the illegal spying
[1:07:16.720 --> 1:07:18.720]  we first broke that two years ago plus
[1:07:18.720 --> 1:07:20.720]  now it's all confirmed
[1:07:20.720 --> 1:07:22.720]  cnn msnbc said info wars
[1:07:22.720 --> 1:07:24.720]  is the source on and on and on
[1:07:24.720 --> 1:07:26.720]  memorializing the fact that we were
[1:07:26.720 --> 1:07:28.720]  indeed correct
[1:07:28.720 --> 1:07:30.720]  but it wasn't very hard i was given secret
[1:07:30.720 --> 1:07:32.720]  dea
[1:07:32.720 --> 1:07:34.720]  documents by federal law enforcement
[1:07:34.720 --> 1:07:36.720]  and i looked at the phone numbers
[1:07:36.720 --> 1:07:38.720]  and they were my private phone numbers
[1:07:38.720 --> 1:07:40.720]  and donald trump's private phone numbers
[1:07:40.720 --> 1:07:42.720]  so i knew
[1:07:42.720 --> 1:07:44.720]  numbers nobody had
[1:07:44.720 --> 1:07:46.720]  and later they had to admit
[1:07:46.720 --> 1:07:48.720]  now that's a crime
[1:07:48.720 --> 1:07:50.720]  they were spying illegally
[1:07:50.720 --> 1:07:52.720]  and then they went and got warrants based on lies
[1:07:52.720 --> 1:07:54.720]  trump has them but that's not all he has
[1:07:56.720 --> 1:07:58.720]  he has
[1:07:58.720 --> 1:08:00.720]  her emails
[1:08:00.720 --> 1:08:02.720]  the pentagon the defense intelligence agency
[1:08:02.720 --> 1:08:04.720]  was all watching hillary's illegal server
[1:08:04.720 --> 1:08:06.720]  and the 18 different countries first it was 10
[1:08:06.720 --> 1:08:08.720]  now it's 18 that were on it
[1:08:08.720 --> 1:08:10.720]  he lied to congress and said it didn't exist
[1:08:12.720 --> 1:08:14.720]  then her and umma abedin broke up more than
[1:08:14.720 --> 1:08:16.720]  what was it 12 phones with hammers
[1:08:16.720 --> 1:08:18.720]  and then burned them
[1:08:20.720 --> 1:08:22.720]  that's obstruction of justice
[1:08:22.720 --> 1:08:24.720]  the server was illegal
[1:08:24.720 --> 1:08:26.720]  the class of material was illegal
[1:08:26.720 --> 1:08:28.720]  but they changed the subject to avonka trump
[1:08:28.720 --> 1:08:30.720]  who's used for pr by the white house
[1:08:30.720 --> 1:08:32.720]  to go have dinner with people
[1:08:32.720 --> 1:08:34.720]  to promote american jobs
[1:08:34.720 --> 1:08:36.720]  that's what they do
[1:08:36.720 --> 1:08:38.720]  they go glad hand folks
[1:08:38.720 --> 1:08:40.720]  to get better nafta and gat deals
[1:08:40.720 --> 1:08:42.720]  they do a good job
[1:08:42.720 --> 1:08:44.720]  that turns into she's the same as hillary because they know
[1:08:44.720 --> 1:08:46.720]  trump's about to bring it out
[1:08:46.720 --> 1:08:48.720]  how huge is this
[1:08:48.720 --> 1:08:50.720]  trump threatens to declassify devastating documents
[1:08:50.720 --> 1:08:52.720]  if democrats want to play rough
[1:08:52.720 --> 1:08:54.720]  and play tough
[1:08:54.720 --> 1:08:56.720]  now he told you that was coming
[1:08:56.720 --> 1:08:58.720]  told you that for months told you this weekend
[1:08:58.720 --> 1:09:00.720]  told you yesterday morning this was coming
[1:09:00.720 --> 1:09:02.720]  and just like the sun comes up it did
[1:09:02.720 --> 1:09:04.720]  but they're gonna counter strike
[1:09:04.720 --> 1:09:06.720]  let me tell you how they're gonna counter strike
[1:09:08.720 --> 1:09:10.720]  they're gonna counter strike by trying to kill the economy
[1:09:10.720 --> 1:09:12.720]  the private federal reserve raised interest rate seven times
[1:09:12.720 --> 1:09:14.720]  never did that to obama
[1:09:14.720 --> 1:09:16.720]  trying to kill the economy
[1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:18.720]  maxine water said when she gets control
[1:09:18.720 --> 1:09:20.720]  of that committee
[1:09:20.720 --> 1:09:22.720]  that deals with finance and jobs
[1:09:22.720 --> 1:09:24.720]  well the most powerful in the house
[1:09:24.720 --> 1:09:26.720]  that she is going to bring back the regulations
[1:09:26.720 --> 1:09:28.720]  by fiat
[1:09:28.720 --> 1:09:30.720]  which are designed to keep
[1:09:30.720 --> 1:09:32.720]  jobs out of the country
[1:09:32.720 --> 1:09:34.720]  general motors
[1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:36.720]  announces with record profits buying back their own stock
[1:09:36.720 --> 1:09:38.720]  but they're moving to china
[1:09:38.720 --> 1:09:40.720]  five plants trump says we bell you out
[1:09:40.720 --> 1:09:42.720]  you have incentives and you have subsidies
[1:09:42.720 --> 1:09:44.720]  we'll take those if you
[1:09:44.720 --> 1:09:46.720]  leave and our own media calls
[1:09:46.720 --> 1:09:48.720]  him the bad guy how could
[1:09:48.720 --> 1:09:50.720]  anybody not see somebody going to bat
[1:09:50.720 --> 1:09:52.720]  for them and unemployment the lowest levels
[1:09:52.720 --> 1:09:54.720]  and in two years it all turn around
[1:09:54.720 --> 1:09:56.720]  and the trump says the federal reserve doesn't stop
[1:09:56.720 --> 1:09:58.720]  it's gonna kill this and then it starts to kill it
[1:09:58.720 --> 1:10:00.720]  and the federal reserve shows up now this
[1:10:00.720 --> 1:10:02.720]  week and says it's trumps fault
[1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:04.720]  the economy is going down
[1:10:04.720 --> 1:10:06.720]  see we told you so when he was the one that warned of it
[1:10:06.720 --> 1:10:08.720]  but they got another ace in the hole
[1:10:10.720 --> 1:10:12.720]  and that is culture war
[1:10:12.720 --> 1:10:14.720]  what does the WikiLeaks talk about
[1:10:14.720 --> 1:10:16.720]  six months before Hillary lost
[1:10:16.720 --> 1:10:18.720]  and Hillary's talking to top
[1:10:18.720 --> 1:10:20.720]  professors in psychological warfare
[1:10:20.720 --> 1:10:22.720]  in advertising
[1:10:22.720 --> 1:10:24.720]  they say we've got to go to
[1:10:24.720 --> 1:10:26.720]  full culture war men against women
[1:10:26.720 --> 1:10:28.720]  women against men black against white
[1:10:28.720 --> 1:10:30.720]  old against young we've got to up it
[1:10:30.720 --> 1:10:32.720]  we've got to totally distract
[1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:34.720]  from what we're doing
[1:10:34.720 --> 1:10:36.720]  and how we're taking their future away
[1:10:36.720 --> 1:10:38.720]  remember Gruber said it's my job to come in
[1:10:38.720 --> 1:10:40.720]  and triple your prices and make you think it's a good deal
[1:10:40.720 --> 1:10:42.720]  and thank God you're so stupid on
[1:10:42.720 --> 1:10:44.720]  Obamacare thank God you don't have a memory
[1:10:46.720 --> 1:10:48.720]  so these
[1:10:48.720 --> 1:10:50.720]  people are predators and Will Johnson joins us
[1:10:50.720 --> 1:10:52.720]  at the balance of the hour we have a surprise guest
[1:10:52.720 --> 1:10:54.720]  perhaps popping in towards the end of the hour
[1:10:54.720 --> 1:10:56.720]  but I'm not going to say exactly what it is
[1:10:56.720 --> 1:10:58.720]  but you'll want to stay tuned I'm supposing it
[1:10:58.720 --> 1:11:00.720]  to happen in the next 30 minutes but we're going to see
[1:11:00.720 --> 1:11:02.720]  Will Johnson again
[1:11:02.720 --> 1:11:04.720]  UnitedAmericanfirst.com great guy
[1:11:04.720 --> 1:11:06.720]  also is the correspondent for mfullwars.com
[1:11:06.720 --> 1:11:08.720]  does some freelance work for us
[1:11:08.720 --> 1:11:10.720]  I wanted to get him on already for the last week
[1:11:10.720 --> 1:11:12.720]  but then I saw this article come out
[1:11:12.720 --> 1:11:13.720]  on mfullwars.com
[1:11:13.720 --> 1:11:15.720]  Paul Watson made this point today
[1:11:15.720 --> 1:11:17.720]  that after banning Alex Jones
[1:11:17.720 --> 1:11:20.720]  YouTube still host race hate supremacist
[1:11:20.720 --> 1:11:22.720]  Duke and Farrakhan now I want to be clear
[1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:24.720]  I've been to Farrakhan's house
[1:11:24.720 --> 1:11:26.720]  I've had dinner with him
[1:11:26.720 --> 1:11:28.720]  he said he wants to stop a race war
[1:11:28.720 --> 1:11:30.720]  I know they take some of what he says out of context
[1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:32.720]  I don't agree with a lot of it
[1:11:32.720 --> 1:11:34.720]  and I think David Duke's been on
[1:11:34.720 --> 1:11:36.720]  I don't agree with David Duke
[1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:38.720]  I tried to do a fair interview
[1:11:38.720 --> 1:11:40.720]  he didn't do that
[1:11:40.720 --> 1:11:42.720]  but my point is I'm not calling for either one of them
[1:11:42.720 --> 1:11:44.720]  to be censored or taken off the web
[1:11:44.720 --> 1:11:46.720]  all I'm saying is there's people promoting pedophilia
[1:11:46.720 --> 1:11:48.720]  on YouTube and Facebook and Twitter
[1:11:48.720 --> 1:11:50.720]  they've got radicals, jihadi groups
[1:11:50.720 --> 1:11:52.720]  that are calling for women to be sexually mutilated
[1:11:52.720 --> 1:11:54.720]  Laura Loomer's taken off
[1:11:54.720 --> 1:11:56.720]  because she exposes
[1:11:56.720 --> 1:11:58.720]  the Democrats all over the country
[1:11:58.720 --> 1:12:00.720]  daughter's genitals off
[1:12:00.720 --> 1:12:02.720]  so why do they leave Lewis Farrakhan
[1:12:02.720 --> 1:12:04.720]  and David Duke and all these other people
[1:12:04.720 --> 1:12:06.720]  on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter
[1:12:06.720 --> 1:12:08.720]  but take me off
[1:12:08.720 --> 1:12:10.720]  and they're doing it because I'm trying to create unity
[1:12:10.720 --> 1:12:12.720]  and I saw some powerful videos
[1:12:12.720 --> 1:12:14.720]  that Will Johnson shot in the last week
[1:12:14.720 --> 1:12:16.720]  one of them
[1:12:16.720 --> 1:12:18.720]  deals with Charlie Brown
[1:12:18.720 --> 1:12:20.720]  Thanksgiving saying it's racist
[1:12:20.720 --> 1:12:22.720]  even though it's the first comic
[1:12:22.720 --> 1:12:24.720]  that actually showed whites and blacks
[1:12:24.720 --> 1:12:26.720]  inclusively together
[1:12:26.720 --> 1:12:28.720]  he did it as a Christian
[1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:30.720]  but they have to invert reality, take everything good and wholesome
[1:12:30.720 --> 1:12:32.720]  and project division on it
[1:12:32.720 --> 1:12:34.720]  that's what WikiLeaks says they're doing
[1:12:34.720 --> 1:12:36.720]  Huffington Post says Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
[1:12:36.720 --> 1:12:38.720]  is problematic and that it is
[1:12:38.720 --> 1:12:40.720]  hateful and bad and evil
[1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:42.720]  and needs to be removed as well
[1:12:42.720 --> 1:12:44.720]  so
[1:12:44.720 --> 1:12:46.720]  these folks are just trying to project
[1:12:46.720 --> 1:12:48.720]  onto everything division
[1:12:48.720 --> 1:12:50.720]  so that everyone is literally at each other's throats
[1:12:50.720 --> 1:12:52.720]  Will Johnson, how would you quantify what's going on with this
[1:12:52.720 --> 1:12:54.720]  because you've really been focused on this
[1:12:54.720 --> 1:12:56.720]  and you're out there on the west coast
[1:12:56.720 --> 1:12:58.720]  tracking all this, you're out there at these antifa events
[1:12:58.720 --> 1:13:00.720]  and you're out there in San Francisco
[1:13:00.720 --> 1:13:02.720]  and Portland watching what's happening
[1:13:02.720 --> 1:13:04.720]  is it just me or is the left getting more insane?
[1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:06.720]  The left is getting more insane
[1:13:06.720 --> 1:13:08.720]  they're constantly
[1:13:08.720 --> 1:13:10.720]  trying to ramp it up
[1:13:10.720 --> 1:13:12.720]  the craziness that's going on in this country
[1:13:12.720 --> 1:13:14.720]  and they're
[1:13:14.720 --> 1:13:16.720]  they're happy about it
[1:13:16.720 --> 1:13:18.720]  they're making excuses
[1:13:18.720 --> 1:13:20.720]  to come out and attack people
[1:13:20.720 --> 1:13:22.720]  they're making excuses to try to demonize
[1:13:22.720 --> 1:13:24.720]  everyone that disagree with them
[1:13:24.720 --> 1:13:26.720]  I mean look how they're doing you
[1:13:26.720 --> 1:13:28.720]  it's absolutely crazy
[1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:30.720]  to actually live
[1:13:30.720 --> 1:13:32.720]  in this country and I love how you say
[1:13:32.720 --> 1:13:34.720]  it's amazing time to be alive
[1:13:34.720 --> 1:13:36.720]  and it is because we're seeing
[1:13:36.720 --> 1:13:38.720]  exactly what they're doing to us
[1:13:38.720 --> 1:13:40.720]  and with everything that's going on the border
[1:13:40.720 --> 1:13:42.720]  the evasion is taking place
[1:13:42.720 --> 1:13:44.720]  and I was watching
[1:13:44.720 --> 1:13:46.720]  before you brought me on
[1:13:46.720 --> 1:13:48.720]  you had a clip where
[1:13:48.720 --> 1:13:50.720]  someone was doing an interview
[1:13:50.720 --> 1:13:52.720]  talking to people
[1:13:52.720 --> 1:13:54.720]  and I have a colleague
[1:13:54.720 --> 1:13:56.720]  that actually went to Tijuana
[1:13:56.720 --> 1:13:58.720]  and while he was down there
[1:13:58.720 --> 1:14:00.720]  talking to them one of the people
[1:14:00.720 --> 1:14:02.720]  there was like 80 people he was telling me
[1:14:02.720 --> 1:14:04.720]  that are like trans
[1:14:04.720 --> 1:14:06.720]  and all of those were pushed away from
[1:14:06.720 --> 1:14:08.720]  the main group of the invasion
[1:14:08.720 --> 1:14:10.720]  because they said they didn't want them involved
[1:14:10.720 --> 1:14:12.720]  with them and so they came
[1:14:12.720 --> 1:14:14.720]  first well he was there interviewing
[1:14:14.720 --> 1:14:16.720]  one of them and they coughed on him
[1:14:16.720 --> 1:14:18.720]  the next day
[1:14:18.720 --> 1:14:20.720]  he had to go to the emergency room because he was
[1:14:20.720 --> 1:14:22.720]  sick he felt ill
[1:14:22.720 --> 1:14:24.720]  and so the media
[1:14:24.720 --> 1:14:26.720]  is nowhere they're never going to talk about it
[1:14:26.720 --> 1:14:28.720]  they're saying that no one is climbing
[1:14:28.720 --> 1:14:30.720]  the walls they're saying that
[1:14:30.720 --> 1:14:32.720]  these people are just trying to seek asylum
[1:14:32.720 --> 1:14:34.720]  and it's not true none of is true
[1:14:34.720 --> 1:14:36.720]  and then Antifa you know
[1:14:36.720 --> 1:14:38.720]  they're right there with them saying that we need
[1:14:38.720 --> 1:14:40.720]  to open up the borders and say let
[1:14:40.720 --> 1:14:42.720]  all these people in know telling what kind
[1:14:42.720 --> 1:14:44.720]  of diseases they're carrying or what they're doing
[1:14:44.720 --> 1:14:46.720]  or what they're going to bring into this country
[1:14:46.720 --> 1:14:48.720]  this nation
[1:14:48.720 --> 1:14:50.720]  Trump duty as the president of the United States
[1:14:50.720 --> 1:14:52.720]  is to protect the United States
[1:14:52.720 --> 1:14:54.720]  and I was doing my broadcast
[1:14:54.720 --> 1:14:56.720]  last night and a gentleman called in and he said
[1:14:56.720 --> 1:14:58.720]  you know what it's not necessarily Trump's wall
[1:14:58.720 --> 1:15:00.720]  it's our wall
[1:15:00.720 --> 1:15:02.720]  it's the people's wall
[1:15:02.720 --> 1:15:04.720]  so we want a wall we are calling
[1:15:04.720 --> 1:15:06.720]  for a wall because we want safety
[1:15:06.720 --> 1:15:08.720]  and security for our families and our children
[1:15:08.720 --> 1:15:10.720]  we deserve it we
[1:15:10.720 --> 1:15:12.720]  earned it and does it just prove that we need
[1:15:12.720 --> 1:15:14.720]  a stronger wall that the third world is collapsing
[1:15:14.720 --> 1:15:16.720]  the UN is using it as a weapon
[1:15:16.720 --> 1:15:18.720]  yes absolutely they're using it as a weapon
[1:15:18.720 --> 1:15:20.720]  because they don't like
[1:15:20.720 --> 1:15:22.720]  the fact that Donald J. Trump our president
[1:15:22.720 --> 1:15:24.720]  is leaving the globalist system
[1:15:24.720 --> 1:15:26.720]  it's a threat to them
[1:15:26.720 --> 1:15:28.720]  the United States
[1:15:28.720 --> 1:15:30.720]  the best country in the world
[1:15:30.720 --> 1:15:32.720]  is leaving the globalist system
[1:15:32.720 --> 1:15:34.720]  and they don't like it they want to keep us
[1:15:34.720 --> 1:15:36.720]  in check and Donald J.
[1:15:36.720 --> 1:15:38.720]  Trump thank God we have him and he's the one
[1:15:38.720 --> 1:15:40.720]  that's doing it and what's crazy
[1:15:40.720 --> 1:15:42.720]  is they're all over TV saying even saying
[1:15:42.720 --> 1:15:44.720]  the nation is evil or racist
[1:15:44.720 --> 1:15:46.720]  saying nationalists is bad
[1:15:46.720 --> 1:15:48.720]  and Cuomo
[1:15:48.720 --> 1:15:50.720]  says America was never great never be that great
[1:15:50.720 --> 1:15:52.720]  these people are anti-American
[1:15:52.720 --> 1:16:14.720]  period we'll be back

[1:17:22.720 --> 1:17:24.720]  Hi I'm Dan Pilla
[1:17:24.720 --> 1:17:26.720]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[1:17:26.720 --> 1:17:28.720]  when they tried to seize my mother's house
[1:17:28.720 --> 1:17:30.720]  I sued the IRS in one
[1:17:30.720 --> 1:17:32.720]  I beat the IRS then
[1:17:32.720 --> 1:17:34.720]  and I've been beating them ever since
[1:17:34.720 --> 1:17:36.720]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement
[1:17:36.720 --> 1:17:38.720]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[1:17:38.720 --> 1:17:40.720]  they thought might never be solved
[1:17:40.720 --> 1:17:42.720]  I can help you too
[1:17:42.720 --> 1:17:44.720]  if you owe taxes you can't pay
[1:17:44.720 --> 1:17:46.720]  don't wait another day

[1:18:08.720 --> 1:18:10.720]  as the years went on

[1:18:12.720 --> 1:18:14.720]  our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula

[1:18:56.720 --> 1:18:58.720]  Living in volcano
[1:18:58.720 --> 1:19:00.720]  may sound more dramatic than it really is
[1:19:00.720 --> 1:19:02.720]  the real drama can be found here
[1:19:02.720 --> 1:19:04.720]  in Leilani Estates
[1:19:04.720 --> 1:19:06.720]  but a lot of us on the big island
[1:19:06.720 --> 1:19:08.720]  rely on rainwater
[1:19:08.720 --> 1:19:10.720]  and we need to be concerned about ash
[1:19:10.720 --> 1:19:12.720]  and acid rain
[1:19:12.720 --> 1:19:14.720]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles
[1:19:14.720 --> 1:19:16.720]  and acid rain could lower the pH
[1:19:16.720 --> 1:19:18.720]  of the water to unhealthy levels
[1:19:18.720 --> 1:19:20.720]  to find out we employed a series
[1:19:20.720 --> 1:19:22.720]  of tests for heavy metals
[1:19:22.720 --> 1:19:24.720]  alkalinity and pH
[1:19:24.720 --> 1:19:26.720]  what we learned was that there was in fact
[1:19:26.720 --> 1:19:28.720]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals
[1:19:28.720 --> 1:19:30.720]  and acidity in the rainwater
[1:19:30.720 --> 1:19:32.720]  next we tested the water
[1:19:32.720 --> 1:19:34.720]  from our Alexa pure gravity filter
[1:19:34.720 --> 1:19:36.720]  and not only were the heavy metal levels
[1:19:36.720 --> 1:19:38.720]  within safe measure
[1:19:38.720 --> 1:19:40.720]  but the pH was also restored
[1:19:40.720 --> 1:19:42.720]  to optimal levels
[1:19:42.720 --> 1:19:44.720]  and it turns out the filter
[1:19:44.720 --> 1:19:46.720]  on the Alexa pure raises the pH
[1:19:46.720 --> 1:19:48.720]  of the water
[1:19:48.720 --> 1:19:50.720]  so what we've learned is that volcanic ash
[1:19:50.720 --> 1:19:52.720]  and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply
[1:19:52.720 --> 1:19:54.720]  but more importantly
[1:19:54.720 --> 1:19:56.720]  a good water filtration system
[1:19:56.720 --> 1:20:22.720]  can purify it.
[1:20:22.720 --> 1:20:24.720]  The world is a dangerous place
[1:20:24.720 --> 1:20:26.720]  because of evil
[1:20:26.720 --> 1:20:28.720]  but because of those who look on
[1:20:28.720 --> 1:20:30.720]  and do nothing
[1:20:30.720 --> 1:20:32.720]  if you are receiving this transmission
[1:20:32.720 --> 1:20:34.720]  you are the resistance
[1:20:34.720 --> 1:20:36.720]  we now take you live
[1:20:36.720 --> 1:20:38.720]  to the Central Texas Command Center
[1:20:38.720 --> 1:20:40.720]  it's Alex Jones
[1:20:40.720 --> 1:20:42.720]  you know 12 years ago
[1:20:42.720 --> 1:20:44.720]  they were doing human trials
[1:20:44.720 --> 1:20:46.720]  of Gardasil
[1:20:46.720 --> 1:20:48.720]  and it was killing women all over the US
[1:20:48.720 --> 1:20:50.720]  they banned it in Japan, banned it in India
[1:20:50.720 --> 1:20:52.720]  you name it
[1:20:52.720 --> 1:20:54.720]  it turns out HPV vaccine
[1:20:54.720 --> 1:20:56.720]  linked to soaring infertility
[1:20:56.720 --> 1:20:58.720]  in fullwars.com
[1:20:58.720 --> 1:21:00.720]  just absolutely incredible
[1:21:00.720 --> 1:21:02.720]  Will Johnson
[1:21:02.720 --> 1:21:04.720]  joins us reporter for the west coast
[1:21:04.720 --> 1:21:06.720]  does work for him fullwars.com
[1:21:06.720 --> 1:21:08.720]  I wanted to get him on
[1:21:08.720 --> 1:21:10.720]  about all the race baiting and where he sees that going
[1:21:10.720 --> 1:21:12.720]  but since he mentioned
[1:21:12.720 --> 1:21:14.720]  the UN funding legal alien caravan
[1:21:14.720 --> 1:21:16.720]  that even mainstream news has to admit
[1:21:16.720 --> 1:21:18.720]  and even the UN has to admit
[1:21:18.720 --> 1:21:20.720]  that they've been caught smuggling
[1:21:20.720 --> 1:21:22.720]  this caravan
[1:21:22.720 --> 1:21:24.720]  and Will Johnson mentioned
[1:21:24.720 --> 1:21:26.720]  to everybody the diseases
[1:21:26.720 --> 1:21:28.720]  I mean Latin America, the rest of the world
[1:21:28.720 --> 1:21:30.720]  these are really dangerous places
[1:21:30.720 --> 1:21:32.720]  and when people came into Ellis Island
[1:21:32.720 --> 1:21:34.720]  they get quarantined for a month, three months, six months
[1:21:34.720 --> 1:21:36.720]  you had to be led into the country
[1:21:36.720 --> 1:21:38.720]  and there wasn't a welfare system
[1:21:38.720 --> 1:21:40.720]  so you didn't drain the nation
[1:21:40.720 --> 1:21:42.720]  this is totally different
[1:21:42.720 --> 1:21:44.720]  now they're saying it so here's part of a Fox News report
[1:21:44.720 --> 1:21:46.720]  dealing
[1:21:46.720 --> 1:21:48.720]  with the amount of diseases coming in
[1:21:48.720 --> 1:21:50.720]  and smuggling children
[1:21:50.720 --> 1:21:52.720]  for the 6,000 plus migrants
[1:21:52.720 --> 1:21:54.720]  that are in this cramped 10 city
[1:21:54.720 --> 1:21:56.720]  that little white tent attached to a small camper
[1:21:56.720 --> 1:21:58.720]  is the extent of
[1:21:58.720 --> 1:22:00.720]  the health services available
[1:22:00.720 --> 1:22:02.720]  from Tijuana's Municipal Health Department
[1:22:02.720 --> 1:22:04.720]  and the numbers are alarming
[1:22:04.720 --> 1:22:06.720]  take a look at these
[1:22:06.720 --> 1:22:08.720]  of the 2,267 migrants
[1:22:08.720 --> 1:22:10.720]  that have been treated so far
[1:22:10.720 --> 1:22:12.720]  we know that over 60%
[1:22:12.720 --> 1:22:14.720]  have respiratory infections
[1:22:14.720 --> 1:22:16.720]  there are three confirmed cases
[1:22:16.720 --> 1:22:18.720]  of tuberculosis
[1:22:18.720 --> 1:22:20.720]  there are four cases
[1:22:20.720 --> 1:22:22.720]  excuse me, of HIV AIDS
[1:22:22.720 --> 1:22:24.720]  101 cases of lice
[1:22:24.720 --> 1:22:26.720]  and four cases of chicken pox
[1:22:26.720 --> 1:22:28.720]  and hepatitis is a real concern here as well
[1:22:28.720 --> 1:22:30.720]  because of the overcrowding
[1:22:30.720 --> 1:22:32.720]  and unsanitary conditions
[1:22:32.720 --> 1:22:34.720]  it's been raining all night
[1:22:34.720 --> 1:22:36.720]  expected to rain all day
[1:22:36.720 --> 1:22:38.720]  the migrants are cold, wet and suffering from colds
[1:22:38.720 --> 1:22:40.720]  and it is creating a situation of frustration
[1:22:40.720 --> 1:22:42.720]  not only because of the fact that they're very sick right now
[1:22:42.720 --> 1:22:44.720]  but also because they believe
[1:22:44.720 --> 1:22:46.720]  they were lied to by organizers
[1:22:46.720 --> 1:22:48.720]  who told them it was going to be much easier
[1:22:48.720 --> 1:22:50.720]  to get across to the US
[1:22:50.720 --> 1:22:52.720]  Marco Munoz is one of those migrants
[1:22:52.720 --> 1:22:54.720]  from Honduras who told me
[1:22:54.720 --> 1:22:56.720]  they're worried we may be headed towards a breaking point
[1:22:56.720 --> 1:22:58.720]  take a listen
[1:22:58.720 --> 1:23:00.720]  they lied to us from the beginning
[1:23:00.720 --> 1:23:02.720]  so most of these people are
[1:23:02.720 --> 1:23:04.720]  disappointed in getting frustrated at the time
[1:23:04.720 --> 1:23:06.720]  so
[1:23:06.720 --> 1:23:08.720]  as you can see every day that passes
[1:23:08.720 --> 1:23:10.720]  more and more people are coming
[1:23:10.720 --> 1:23:12.720]  so there's going to be a point
[1:23:12.720 --> 1:23:14.720]  break
[1:23:14.720 --> 1:23:16.720]  they're just going to say let's just rush in there
[1:23:16.720 --> 1:23:18.720]  and we're hearing that there may be
[1:23:18.720 --> 1:23:20.720]  we're hearing there may be an effort
[1:23:20.720 --> 1:23:22.720]  to move some of these folks to
[1:23:22.720 --> 1:23:24.720]  another location to create a spot
[1:23:24.720 --> 1:23:26.720]  with more space
[1:23:26.720 --> 1:23:28.720]  we'll find out if that happens
[1:23:28.720 --> 1:23:30.720]  we're also hearing of a potential march
[1:23:30.720 --> 1:23:32.720]  amongst the migrants here
[1:23:32.720 --> 1:23:34.720]  of course the last time there was a march on Sunday
[1:23:34.720 --> 1:23:36.720]  it turned violent and was a bad situation
[1:23:36.720 --> 1:23:38.720]  we'll find out situations fluid
[1:23:38.720 --> 1:23:40.720]  but one thing's for sure these migrants
[1:23:40.720 --> 1:23:42.720]  are not healthy
[1:23:42.720 --> 1:23:44.720]  now the key here isn't just the diseases
[1:23:44.720 --> 1:23:46.720]  it's that they were told by the organizers
[1:23:46.720 --> 1:23:48.720]  which is the UN
[1:23:48.720 --> 1:23:50.720]  is USAID
[1:23:50.720 --> 1:23:52.720]  is open societies foundation
[1:23:52.720 --> 1:23:54.720]  they get them for years
[1:23:54.720 --> 1:23:56.720]  pay them mass them in central and south America
[1:23:56.720 --> 1:23:58.720]  march them up
[1:23:58.720 --> 1:24:00.720]  give them thousand dollar debit cards for each leg
[1:24:00.720 --> 1:24:02.720]  they get there
[1:24:02.720 --> 1:24:04.720]  and then they build them up build them up
[1:24:04.720 --> 1:24:06.720]  until our border collapses
[1:24:06.720 --> 1:24:08.720]  and then our healthcare and our judges
[1:24:08.720 --> 1:24:10.720]  settle it and then the word is
[1:24:10.720 --> 1:24:12.720]  just go through and you're open like Europe
[1:24:12.720 --> 1:24:14.720]  we'll say how did Europe let that happen
[1:24:14.720 --> 1:24:16.720]  those images of those giant snakes
[1:24:16.720 --> 1:24:18.720]  of hundreds of thousands at a time coming in
[1:24:18.720 --> 1:24:20.720]  because this is how
[1:24:20.720 --> 1:24:22.720]  they break you
[1:24:22.720 --> 1:24:24.720]  this is a world government plan
[1:24:24.720 --> 1:24:26.720]  and they're using these poor people as the weapon system
[1:24:26.720 --> 1:24:28.720]  and then they build up
[1:24:28.720 --> 1:24:30.720]  in a big open air camp
[1:24:30.720 --> 1:24:32.720]  and it's America's fault
[1:24:32.720 --> 1:24:34.720]  but then LA and San Francisco
[1:24:34.720 --> 1:24:36.720]  and Portland they turn
[1:24:36.720 --> 1:24:38.720]  up in air camps. Austin, Texas
[1:24:38.720 --> 1:24:40.720]  since California collapsed into us
[1:24:40.720 --> 1:24:42.720]  I can go 700 yards
[1:24:42.720 --> 1:24:44.720]  and there's a migrant camp
[1:24:44.720 --> 1:24:46.720]  I can go another half mile
[1:24:46.720 --> 1:24:48.720]  and there's a big homeless camp
[1:24:48.720 --> 1:24:50.720]  in fact I'm going to go tour those next week
[1:24:50.720 --> 1:24:52.720]  we're going to go tour
[1:24:52.720 --> 1:24:54.720]  these tent cities
[1:24:54.720 --> 1:24:56.720]  Will Johnson
[1:24:56.720 --> 1:24:58.720]  they are really bringing this country down
[1:24:58.720 --> 1:25:00.720]  this is the plan
[1:25:00.720 --> 1:25:02.720]  and the UN admits it's the plan and now they got this new UN treaty
[1:25:02.720 --> 1:25:04.720]  they're trying to ratify
[1:25:04.720 --> 1:25:06.720]  making it the law globally
[1:25:06.720 --> 1:25:08.720]  that anybody who wants to come to your country can come there
[1:25:08.720 --> 1:25:10.720]  yeah you're absolutely right
[1:25:10.720 --> 1:25:12.720]  you know we have over
[1:25:12.720 --> 1:25:14.720]  50,000 people alone
[1:25:14.720 --> 1:25:16.720]  in LA that are homeless
[1:25:16.720 --> 1:25:18.720]  and the Democrats act like they're more concerned
[1:25:18.720 --> 1:25:20.720]  about this invasion the people that are trying to
[1:25:20.720 --> 1:25:22.720]  invade this country than they are the American citizens
[1:25:22.720 --> 1:25:24.720]  LA
[1:25:24.720 --> 1:25:26.720]  has 50,000
[1:25:26.720 --> 1:25:28.720]  people
[1:25:28.720 --> 1:25:30.720]  we just had a massive burn
[1:25:30.720 --> 1:25:32.720]  in the Northern California area
[1:25:32.720 --> 1:25:34.720]  people are without homes
[1:25:34.720 --> 1:25:36.720]  we're the Democrats we're the leftists
[1:25:36.720 --> 1:25:38.720]  talking about we need to put them
[1:25:38.720 --> 1:25:40.720]  in buildings with you know
[1:25:40.720 --> 1:25:42.720]  game consoles AC
[1:25:42.720 --> 1:25:44.720]  they're not doing that they're more concerned about
[1:25:44.720 --> 1:25:46.720]  getting people that's going to come here and vote
[1:25:46.720 --> 1:25:48.720]  for them I mean they're calling for these
[1:25:48.720 --> 1:25:50.720]  people just get automatic citizenship
[1:25:50.720 --> 1:25:52.720]  so they can vote for the Democrats
[1:25:52.720 --> 1:25:54.720]  the Democrats don't care about the people
[1:25:54.720 --> 1:25:56.720]  they don't care about anything in America
[1:25:56.720 --> 1:25:58.720]  they just want to keep in power
[1:25:58.720 --> 1:26:00.720]  and they want to control
[1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:02.720]  and we're seeing it firsthand
[1:26:02.720 --> 1:26:04.720]  we're seeing it and then all these
[1:26:04.720 --> 1:26:06.720]  migrant places that they're creating there's no
[1:26:06.720 --> 1:26:08.720]  telling what kind of diseases that they're
[1:26:08.720 --> 1:26:10.720]  bringing through
[1:26:10.720 --> 1:26:12.720]  oh I see the cases in California of TB
[1:26:12.720 --> 1:26:14.720]  of smallpox
[1:26:14.720 --> 1:26:16.720]  of exploding and they go oh more vaccines
[1:26:16.720 --> 1:26:18.720]  is the answer and it's vaccinated people
[1:26:18.720 --> 1:26:20.720]  that are getting it no you're bringing
[1:26:20.720 --> 1:26:22.720]  people in from third world countries unvetted
[1:26:22.720 --> 1:26:24.720]  untested
[1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:26.720]  yeah you're absolutely right and it's funny that you bring up
[1:26:26.720 --> 1:26:28.720]  more vaccines are needed right
[1:26:28.720 --> 1:26:30.720]  just in New York
[1:26:30.720 --> 1:26:32.720]  a senator in New York got a flu
[1:26:32.720 --> 1:26:34.720]  vaccine
[1:26:34.720 --> 1:26:36.720]  two weeks later he died
[1:26:36.720 --> 1:26:38.720]  and he contributed him getting sick
[1:26:38.720 --> 1:26:40.720]  to the flu vaccine
[1:26:40.720 --> 1:26:42.720]  you know if you get a if you get flu poisoning
[1:26:42.720 --> 1:26:44.720]  and your stomach is hurting you know like
[1:26:44.720 --> 1:26:46.720]  and you know that you just ate something
[1:26:46.720 --> 1:26:48.720]  you get sick after you get
[1:26:48.720 --> 1:26:50.720]  the flu shot most people say well I got sick
[1:26:50.720 --> 1:26:52.720]  because I got the flu shot he died
[1:26:52.720 --> 1:26:54.720]  two weeks later
[1:26:54.720 --> 1:26:56.720]  and now they're bringing all this in
[1:26:56.720 --> 1:26:58.720]  they're going to be pushing these vaccines on the people
[1:26:58.720 --> 1:27:00.720]  and it's just
[1:27:00.720 --> 1:27:02.720]  deliberate way to control
[1:27:02.720 --> 1:27:04.720]  the masses and we're seeing
[1:27:04.720 --> 1:27:06.720]  it in our face they're not even hiding it
[1:27:06.720 --> 1:27:08.720]  any longer and then it's part
[1:27:08.720 --> 1:27:10.720]  of the whole agenda that they wanted
[1:27:10.720 --> 1:27:12.720]  to do to the American people
[1:27:12.720 --> 1:27:14.720]  we're going to go to break here
[1:27:14.720 --> 1:27:16.720]  in a few minutes will Johnson but
[1:27:16.720 --> 1:27:18.720]  you know Trump has his Trump
[1:27:18.720 --> 1:27:20.720]  card to go after them for the illegal
[1:27:20.720 --> 1:27:22.720]  spying Hillary's emails with other government has
[1:27:22.720 --> 1:27:24.720]  all the crimes they've committed the fact
[1:27:24.720 --> 1:27:26.720]  that they are colluding as Democrats to try to take Trump
[1:27:26.720 --> 1:27:28.720]  out but now they've
[1:27:28.720 --> 1:27:30.720]  rated the offices of a lawyer
[1:27:30.720 --> 1:27:32.720]  who previously did tax work for Trump
[1:27:32.720 --> 1:27:34.720]  they're acting like the fact that Trump
[1:27:34.720 --> 1:27:36.720]  has tax free groups that Trump
[1:27:36.720 --> 1:27:38.720]  has foundations that Trump
[1:27:38.720 --> 1:27:40.720]  has family trust
[1:27:40.720 --> 1:27:42.720]  they're totally normal that that's somehow
[1:27:42.720 --> 1:27:44.720]  dirty and bad so they
[1:27:44.720 --> 1:27:46.720]  can then leak all of this
[1:27:46.720 --> 1:27:48.720]  once they have it so we're
[1:27:48.720 --> 1:27:50.720]  going to be looking at that after we come back from break
[1:27:50.720 --> 1:27:52.720]  please don't forget ladies and gentlemen
[1:27:52.720 --> 1:27:54.720]  that this country is in a fight for
[1:27:54.720 --> 1:27:56.720]  its life and please don't forget
[1:27:56.720 --> 1:27:58.720]  that without your support we will not be on the air
[1:27:58.720 --> 1:28:00.720]  those aren't words
[1:28:00.720 --> 1:28:02.720]  that's the reality we're not just some run-of-the-mill
[1:28:02.720 --> 1:28:04.720]  talk show we're a broadcast
[1:28:04.720 --> 1:28:06.720]  that has the expert guest
[1:28:06.720 --> 1:28:08.720]  the research the facts on
[1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:10.720]  that a lot of key people in government
[1:28:10.720 --> 1:28:12.720]  not just here but around the world listen to
[1:28:12.720 --> 1:28:14.720]  and it's critical
[1:28:14.720 --> 1:28:16.720]  to obviously keep info wars on the air under this attack
[1:28:16.720 --> 1:28:18.720]  if you go to infowarstore.com
[1:28:18.720 --> 1:28:20.720]  and if you get

[1:33:24.720 --> 1:33:26.720]  it's Alex Jones
[1:33:30.720 --> 1:33:32.720]  this country's always had problems always had corruption
[1:33:32.720 --> 1:33:34.720]  but the ideals
[1:33:34.720 --> 1:33:36.720]  of turning the people loose
[1:33:36.720 --> 1:33:38.720]  not worshiping royalty not worshiping cliques
[1:33:38.720 --> 1:33:40.720]  not worshiping cartels
[1:33:40.720 --> 1:33:42.720]  but really supporting rugged individualism
[1:33:42.720 --> 1:33:44.720]  created something very very special
[1:33:46.720 --> 1:33:48.720]  now President Trump
[1:33:48.720 --> 1:33:50.720]  has a long history
[1:33:50.720 --> 1:33:52.720]  he's not a corrupt person
[1:33:52.720 --> 1:33:54.720]  but he is a tough guy when it comes to business
[1:33:54.720 --> 1:33:56.720]  and
[1:33:56.720 --> 1:33:58.720]  they launched this entire
[1:33:58.720 --> 1:34:00.720]  garbage filled
[1:34:00.720 --> 1:34:02.720]  Russia investigation
[1:34:02.720 --> 1:34:04.720]  to discredit not just Trump
[1:34:04.720 --> 1:34:06.720]  not just Alex Jones and not just Matt
[1:34:06.720 --> 1:34:08.720]  Drudge but you
[1:34:08.720 --> 1:34:10.720]  everybody out there
[1:34:10.720 --> 1:34:12.720]  the American people
[1:34:12.720 --> 1:34:14.720]  and here we are they launched this investigation
[1:34:14.720 --> 1:34:16.720]  it turns out actually about
[1:34:16.720 --> 1:34:18.720]  three and a half years ago illegally
[1:34:18.720 --> 1:34:20.720]  and then they used the investigation
[1:34:20.720 --> 1:34:22.720]  started officially two years ago to cover up for that
[1:34:22.720 --> 1:34:24.720]  and now the Hill
[1:34:24.720 --> 1:34:26.720]  is reporting what we knew was coming
[1:34:26.720 --> 1:34:28.720]  one of Trump's many lawyers
[1:34:28.720 --> 1:34:30.720]  Cohen
[1:34:30.720 --> 1:34:32.720]  goes and sells Congress
[1:34:32.720 --> 1:34:34.720]  the FBI that Trump did nothing wrong
[1:34:34.720 --> 1:34:36.720]  and never you know
[1:34:36.720 --> 1:34:38.720]  and it ended deals trying to build condos
[1:34:38.720 --> 1:34:40.720]  in Russia he builds them all over the world
[1:34:40.720 --> 1:34:42.720]  from Thailand to South Africa
[1:34:42.720 --> 1:34:44.720]  plus Trump said that's totally legally
[1:34:44.720 --> 1:34:46.720]  even if I did
[1:34:48.720 --> 1:34:50.720]  but now Cohen gets busted
[1:34:50.720 --> 1:34:52.720]  pleads guilty to 50 million dollars
[1:34:52.720 --> 1:34:54.720]  and laundered money in his taxi service
[1:34:54.720 --> 1:34:56.720]  which if he had been a good globalist
[1:34:56.720 --> 1:34:58.720]  he could have done
[1:34:58.720 --> 1:35:00.720]  but because he was with Trump they
[1:35:00.720 --> 1:35:02.720]  burned him so they could then get him to roll over
[1:35:02.720 --> 1:35:04.720]  and they finally found somebody that would
[1:35:04.720 --> 1:35:06.720]  and so they've been raiding all these other lawyers
[1:35:06.720 --> 1:35:08.720]  that have done work for Trump
[1:35:08.720 --> 1:35:10.720]  lawyers that they know have dirt
[1:35:10.720 --> 1:35:12.720]  lawyers work for Trump in hundreds of cities
[1:35:12.720 --> 1:35:14.720]  I'm not that big
[1:35:14.720 --> 1:35:16.720]  of a company owner I'm nothing compared to somebody like Trump
[1:35:16.720 --> 1:35:18.720]  but you know when you're doing business
[1:35:18.720 --> 1:35:20.720]  or have to fight something in a city you hire
[1:35:20.720 --> 1:35:22.720]  whoever the best lawyer is reportedly
[1:35:22.720 --> 1:35:24.720]  in that town
[1:35:24.720 --> 1:35:26.720]  but then they get dirt on the lawyers
[1:35:26.720 --> 1:35:28.720]  I've even dealt with this myself
[1:35:28.720 --> 1:35:30.720]  I'm not going to get into it this time
[1:35:30.720 --> 1:35:32.720]  and then those lawyers become operas against you
[1:35:32.720 --> 1:35:34.720]  but they get raided
[1:35:34.720 --> 1:35:36.720]  so they can then plea bargain
[1:35:36.720 --> 1:35:38.720]  and get out of all the other stuff they've done
[1:35:38.720 --> 1:35:40.720]  until after you
[1:35:40.720 --> 1:35:42.720]  and that's what's happened with Michael Cohen
[1:35:42.720 --> 1:35:44.720]  I'm not saying that's what's happened with this new lawyer
[1:35:44.720 --> 1:35:46.720]  but it's a lawyer in Chicago
[1:35:46.720 --> 1:35:48.720]  that's represented Trump on his towers there
[1:35:48.720 --> 1:35:50.720]  for decades
[1:35:50.720 --> 1:35:52.720]  who a year ago said he didn't like Trump anymore
[1:35:52.720 --> 1:35:54.720]  ooh how magic
[1:35:54.720 --> 1:35:56.720]  and now magically
[1:35:56.720 --> 1:35:58.720]  what are they going to find
[1:35:58.720 --> 1:36:00.720]  you understand
[1:36:00.720 --> 1:36:02.720]  there's hundreds of lawyers the ones they raid
[1:36:02.720 --> 1:36:04.720]  or the ones they think they've got something on
[1:36:04.720 --> 1:36:06.720]  not Trump
[1:36:06.720 --> 1:36:08.720]  federal agents raid office of the lawyer
[1:36:08.720 --> 1:36:10.720]  who previously did tax work for Trump
[1:36:10.720 --> 1:36:12.720]  federal agents have reportedly
[1:36:12.720 --> 1:36:14.720]  raided the Chicago City Hall offices of the lawyer
[1:36:14.720 --> 1:36:16.720]  who previously did tax work for President Donald Trump
[1:36:16.720 --> 1:36:18.720]  he goes on from there
[1:36:18.720 --> 1:36:20.720]  Chicago sometimes reports
[1:36:20.720 --> 1:36:22.720]  the federal agents removed everyone
[1:36:22.720 --> 1:36:24.720]  from the office of Chicago Finance Committee
[1:36:24.720 --> 1:36:26.720]  Chairman Ed Burke Thursday morning
[1:36:26.720 --> 1:36:28.720]  covering the floor
[1:36:28.720 --> 1:36:30.720]  to ceiling windows with brown paper
[1:36:30.720 --> 1:36:32.720]  yes they can do their work with no one seeing it
[1:36:32.720 --> 1:36:34.720]  so that's how this works
[1:36:34.720 --> 1:36:36.720]  no Russia collusion
[1:36:36.720 --> 1:36:38.720]  no espionage that's all the Democrats
[1:36:38.720 --> 1:36:40.720]  it's some lawyer
[1:36:40.720 --> 1:36:42.720]  that did tax work over decades
[1:36:42.720 --> 1:36:44.720]  for Trump on real estate
[1:36:44.720 --> 1:36:46.720]  property in Chicago
[1:36:46.720 --> 1:36:48.720]  and now
[1:36:48.720 --> 1:36:50.720]  that's what the Democrats are going to investigate in Congress
[1:36:50.720 --> 1:36:52.720]  coming up on January 2nd
[1:36:52.720 --> 1:36:54.720]  when they go into power
[1:36:54.720 --> 1:36:56.720]  where was Russiagate oh it's all blown out the window
[1:36:56.720 --> 1:36:58.720]  it's now all this that's why Trump has to go on
[1:36:58.720 --> 1:37:00.720]  total offense
[1:37:00.720 --> 1:37:02.720]  because yes he's got them committing
[1:37:02.720 --> 1:37:04.720]  all these crimes but they think
[1:37:04.720 --> 1:37:06.720]  they've got enough criminals in the FBI
[1:37:06.720 --> 1:37:08.720]  and the Justice Department where they'll never prosecute each other
[1:37:08.720 --> 1:37:10.720]  because they've gotten so many other
[1:37:10.720 --> 1:37:12.720]  bad people in the FBI
[1:37:12.720 --> 1:37:14.720]  that they're corrupt as well
[1:37:14.720 --> 1:37:16.720]  and that's how corruption works
[1:37:16.720 --> 1:37:18.720]  once you get a big enough number of people
[1:37:18.720 --> 1:37:20.720]  who are corrupt who are on the payroll
[1:37:20.720 --> 1:37:22.720]  then no one can stand up and do anything good
[1:37:22.720 --> 1:37:24.720]  even for their own country
[1:37:24.720 --> 1:37:26.720]  their own children because they'll get burned too
[1:37:26.720 --> 1:37:28.720]  and once you reach a critical mass like this
[1:37:28.720 --> 1:37:30.720]  you become a banana republic
[1:37:30.720 --> 1:37:32.720]  and so that's where we are at this point
[1:37:32.720 --> 1:37:34.720]  and I just hope
[1:37:34.720 --> 1:37:36.720]  and pray people realize how much trouble we're in
[1:37:36.720 --> 1:37:38.720]  and we're fighting this psychotic corruption
[1:37:38.720 --> 1:37:40.720]  the good news is Will Johnson
[1:37:40.720 --> 1:37:42.720]  is the investigative reporter
[1:37:42.720 --> 1:37:44.720]  journalist that's worked for M4s
[1:37:44.720 --> 1:37:46.720]  founded the great national group
[1:37:46.720 --> 1:37:48.720]  that reaches hundreds of millions of people
[1:37:48.720 --> 1:37:50.720]  get out of America first
[1:37:50.720 --> 1:37:52.720]  the good news is
[1:37:52.720 --> 1:37:54.720]  and we're going to show this next hour
[1:37:54.720 --> 1:37:56.720]  Hillary and Bill
[1:37:56.720 --> 1:37:58.720]  had their so-called national rally
[1:37:58.720 --> 1:38:00.720]  we're talking a thousand people
[1:38:00.720 --> 1:38:02.720]  show up at these things
[1:38:02.720 --> 1:38:04.720]  versus 20,000 at Trump's
[1:38:04.720 --> 1:38:06.720]  and so
[1:38:06.720 --> 1:38:08.720]  they think they've still got the power and the control
[1:38:08.720 --> 1:38:10.720]  but much of that is a bluff now
[1:38:10.720 --> 1:38:12.720]  and I think if Trump makes his move on this system
[1:38:12.720 --> 1:38:14.720]  they're all going to fold like a house of cards
[1:38:14.720 --> 1:38:16.720]  what do you think?
[1:38:16.720 --> 1:38:18.720]  I completely agree
[1:38:18.720 --> 1:38:20.720]  I think they're all going to fold like a house of cards
[1:38:20.720 --> 1:38:22.720]  you know it's amazing to me
[1:38:22.720 --> 1:38:24.720]  how the democrats can commit all these crimes
[1:38:24.720 --> 1:38:26.720]  because we've all seen it
[1:38:26.720 --> 1:38:28.720]  nothing happens to them
[1:38:28.720 --> 1:38:30.720]  and everyone keeps saying is Trump going to do something
[1:38:30.720 --> 1:38:32.720]  is Trump going to do something
[1:38:32.720 --> 1:38:34.720]  I think Trump is just letting them dig their graves
[1:38:34.720 --> 1:38:36.720]  even deeper and then he's just going to
[1:38:36.720 --> 1:38:38.720]  pour the dirt on top of them
[1:38:38.720 --> 1:38:40.720]  they have committed all of these crimes
[1:38:40.720 --> 1:38:42.720]  throughout history
[1:38:42.720 --> 1:38:44.720]  why is it that
[1:38:44.720 --> 1:38:46.720]  democrats can do it
[1:38:46.720 --> 1:38:48.720]  but conservatives do something and they completely want to remove
[1:38:48.720 --> 1:38:50.720]  you say something
[1:38:50.720 --> 1:38:52.720]  that they disagree with they want you removed
[1:38:52.720 --> 1:38:54.720]  the corruption is
[1:38:54.720 --> 1:38:56.720]  that an all time high
[1:38:56.720 --> 1:38:58.720]  if I may
[1:38:58.720 --> 1:39:00.720]  let me switch it a little bit
[1:39:00.720 --> 1:39:02.720]  because I know you wanted me to talk about
[1:39:02.720 --> 1:39:04.720]  I just love your report
[1:39:04.720 --> 1:39:06.720]  especially your one on Charlie Brown
[1:39:06.720 --> 1:39:08.720]  yeah I was going to talk about that
[1:39:08.720 --> 1:39:10.720]  you know the racism in this country
[1:39:10.720 --> 1:39:12.720]  I've heard liberals
[1:39:12.720 --> 1:39:14.720]  and even some of the
[1:39:14.720 --> 1:39:16.720]  not even just social media but the mainstream media
[1:39:16.720 --> 1:39:18.720]  even try to say Alex Jones
[1:39:18.720 --> 1:39:20.720]  is racist
[1:39:20.720 --> 1:39:22.720]  you're not racist I've been watching you for years
[1:39:22.720 --> 1:39:24.720]  and you're not racist
[1:39:24.720 --> 1:39:26.720]  and then they try to say that you're calling
[1:39:26.720 --> 1:39:28.720]  for violence and you've never called for violence
[1:39:28.720 --> 1:39:30.720]  you are a man
[1:39:30.720 --> 1:39:32.720]  you are a Christian you're a golly man
[1:39:32.720 --> 1:39:34.720]  you will stand up and you make that clear
[1:39:34.720 --> 1:39:36.720]  and I do the same thing
[1:39:36.720 --> 1:39:38.720]  what they're doing here with the Charlie Brown issue
[1:39:38.720 --> 1:39:40.720]  is just another thing for them to attack
[1:39:40.720 --> 1:39:42.720]  Christians that's the goal
[1:39:42.720 --> 1:39:44.720]  they want to attack Christianity
[1:39:44.720 --> 1:39:46.720]  at its fullest
[1:39:46.720 --> 1:39:48.720]  because the creator of Peanuts
[1:39:48.720 --> 1:39:50.720]  he did it for the strips
[1:39:50.720 --> 1:39:52.720]  to introduce Christianity
[1:39:52.720 --> 1:39:54.720]  to bring in conversations
[1:39:54.720 --> 1:39:56.720]  so people would start talking
[1:39:56.720 --> 1:39:58.720]  about it and they don't like it
[1:39:58.720 --> 1:40:00.720]  so they found a way that
[1:40:00.720 --> 1:40:02.720]  hey let's try to demonize Charlie Brown
[1:40:02.720 --> 1:40:04.720]  because he had a black kid sitting on one side
[1:40:04.720 --> 1:40:06.720]  regardless
[1:40:06.720 --> 1:40:08.720]  you know let's not talk about the black kid
[1:40:08.720 --> 1:40:10.720]  Franklin
[1:40:10.720 --> 1:40:12.720]  in the comic strip he's sitting there
[1:40:12.720 --> 1:40:14.720]  in a lawn chair which the lawn chair is more comfortable
[1:40:14.720 --> 1:40:16.720]  than the other chairs and he has
[1:40:16.720 --> 1:40:18.720]  the eating utensil no one else does
[1:40:18.720 --> 1:40:20.720]  explain that
[1:40:20.720 --> 1:40:22.720]  so these liberals are so hateful
[1:40:22.720 --> 1:40:24.720]  they try to deem off to which
[1:40:24.720 --> 1:40:26.720]  actually going on that he actually
[1:40:26.720 --> 1:40:28.720]  has a seat at the table
[1:40:28.720 --> 1:40:30.720]  he actually has a seat at the table
[1:40:30.720 --> 1:40:32.720]  and then you even dug up the letter where he
[1:40:32.720 --> 1:40:34.720]  in the early 60's
[1:40:34.720 --> 1:40:36.720]  was one of the first people
[1:40:36.720 --> 1:40:38.720]  Martin Luther King to put a black character in there
[1:40:38.720 --> 1:40:40.720]  and it's everybody looking at each other
[1:40:40.720 --> 1:40:42.720]  across the table like when you sit across from
[1:40:42.720 --> 1:40:44.720]  your wife or your friend you want to talk to them
[1:40:44.720 --> 1:40:46.720]  that's why he's sitting across the table
[1:40:46.720 --> 1:40:48.720]  is because they're interfacing that's the whole point
[1:40:48.720 --> 1:40:50.720]  yeah so originally he wasn't
[1:40:50.720 --> 1:40:52.720]  even invited to the dinner
[1:40:52.720 --> 1:40:54.720]  but peppermint patty brought him to the dinner
[1:40:54.720 --> 1:40:56.720]  and they said you know what let's pull up a seat
[1:40:56.720 --> 1:40:58.720]  for you here's one
[1:40:58.720 --> 1:41:00.720]  when you're kids no one thought
[1:41:00.720 --> 1:41:02.720]  about Charlie Brown being racist
[1:41:02.720 --> 1:41:04.720]  you hear all the parents and all the parents
[1:41:04.720 --> 1:41:06.720]  talking about politics and everything else
[1:41:06.720 --> 1:41:08.720]  want want want want want want
[1:41:08.720 --> 1:41:10.720]  no one cared everyone wanted to pay
[1:41:10.720 --> 1:41:12.720]  attention to what the kids were doing
[1:41:12.720 --> 1:41:14.720]  everyone just wanted to pay attention to the story
[1:41:14.720 --> 1:41:16.720]  the message
[1:41:16.720 --> 1:41:18.720]  for TV viewers Hillary
[1:41:18.720 --> 1:41:20.720]  sitting on the other side of Obama that was to put Obama down
[1:41:20.720 --> 1:41:22.720]  exactly
[1:41:22.720 --> 1:41:24.720]  but here's the point it's just like Rudolph the red news reindeer
[1:41:24.720 --> 1:41:26.720]  they're now saying racist
[1:41:26.720 --> 1:41:28.720]  they take anything that's unifying people
[1:41:28.720 --> 1:41:30.720]  and say it's racist and then David Duke
[1:41:30.720 --> 1:41:32.720]  and Lewis Farrakhan and I'm not calling them to be removed
[1:41:32.720 --> 1:41:34.720]  I'm simply saying
[1:41:34.720 --> 1:41:36.720]  why are they all left
[1:41:36.720 --> 1:41:38.720]  on everything but I'm taken down
[1:41:38.720 --> 1:41:40.720]  because we're creating unity that's why
[1:41:40.720 --> 1:41:42.720]  you know what you're absolutely right
[1:41:42.720 --> 1:41:44.720]  and they don't like the fact that you're reaching so many people
[1:41:44.720 --> 1:41:46.720]  and you keep coming
[1:41:46.720 --> 1:41:48.720]  with the truth you keep coming with the facts
[1:41:48.720 --> 1:41:50.720]  you say what they're
[1:41:50.720 --> 1:41:52.720]  going to do tomorrow
[1:41:52.720 --> 1:41:54.720]  and then guess what they do it tomorrow
[1:41:54.720 --> 1:41:56.720]  and then they don't like the fact that you're exposing them
[1:41:56.720 --> 1:41:58.720]  you constantly
[1:41:58.720 --> 1:42:00.720]  expose them and you are a threat to them
[1:42:00.720 --> 1:42:02.720]  and you know what
[1:42:02.720 --> 1:42:04.720]  I'm so honored and
[1:42:04.720 --> 1:42:06.720]  blessed to be a part of

[1:42:24.720 --> 1:42:26.720]  from the streets of a very large city in the US
[1:42:26.720 --> 1:42:28.720]  we'll just leave it at that
[1:42:28.720 --> 1:42:30.720]  I'm going to ask not to say what it is until it happens
[1:42:30.720 --> 1:42:32.720]  but you'll definitely want to tune in for that next hour

[1:44:32.720 --> 1:44:34.720]  and secured more of the deep earth crystals
[1:44:34.720 --> 1:44:36.720]  of nascent iodine
[1:44:36.720 --> 1:44:38.720]  but chemists, scientists and others
[1:44:38.720 --> 1:44:40.720]  showed us the research that by combining it
[1:44:40.720 --> 1:44:42.720]  with three other compounds
[1:44:42.720 --> 1:44:44.720]  two forms of iodine and vitamin C

[1:46:22.720 --> 1:46:24.720]  a few months into next year

[1:46:28.720 --> 1:46:30.720]  it would take an hour to go over to some of it

[1:47:28.720 --> 1:47:30.720]  Alex Jones
[1:47:30.720 --> 1:47:32.720]  Alex Jones
[1:47:32.720 --> 1:47:34.720]  Alex Jones
[1:47:34.720 --> 1:47:36.720]  there's a big news article out today
[1:47:36.720 --> 1:47:38.720]  but it was a big tech research
[1:47:38.720 --> 1:47:40.720]  groups
[1:47:40.720 --> 1:47:42.720]  AHREFs.com
[1:47:42.720 --> 1:47:44.720]  the top web searches
[1:47:44.720 --> 1:47:46.720]  of 2018 on google
[1:47:46.720 --> 1:47:48.720]  youtube
[1:47:48.720 --> 1:47:50.720]  and guess who beat trump out in searches
[1:47:50.720 --> 1:47:52.720]  Alex Jones
[1:47:52.720 --> 1:47:54.720]  was the
[1:47:54.720 --> 1:47:56.720]  40th most searched
[1:47:56.720 --> 1:47:58.720]  1,990
[1:47:58.720 --> 1:48:00.720]  plus times
[1:48:00.720 --> 1:48:02.720]  trump was searched 1,950
[1:48:02.720 --> 1:48:04.720]  times I'm not in competition with trump
[1:48:04.720 --> 1:48:06.720]  it's just funny we were right next to each other
[1:48:06.720 --> 1:48:08.720]  but here's the problem
[1:48:08.720 --> 1:48:10.720]  they've been gaming youtube and google for a while
[1:48:10.720 --> 1:48:12.720]  but as soon as they took me completely off
[1:48:14.720 --> 1:48:16.720]  all they put
[1:48:16.720 --> 1:48:18.720]  is lies and disinfo
[1:48:18.720 --> 1:48:20.720]  Megan Kelly
[1:48:20.720 --> 1:48:22.720]  John Oliver
[1:48:22.720 --> 1:48:24.720]  all these edited things go on top
[1:48:24.720 --> 1:48:26.720]  the young turds
[1:48:26.720 --> 1:48:28.720]  but you can
[1:48:28.720 --> 1:48:30.720]  overpower them
[1:48:30.720 --> 1:48:32.720]  word of mouth
[1:48:32.720 --> 1:48:34.720]  you can
[1:48:34.720 --> 1:48:36.720]  overpower them and say go to news wars.com
[1:48:36.720 --> 1:48:38.720]  go to info wars.com
[1:48:38.720 --> 1:48:40.720]  hear what he's really saying when you hear
[1:48:40.720 --> 1:48:42.720]  or you see the headline Alex Jones
[1:48:42.720 --> 1:48:44.720]  KKK remember CNN
[1:48:44.720 --> 1:48:46.720]  one time put Alex Jones KKK
[1:48:48.720 --> 1:48:50.720]  with me about
[1:48:50.720 --> 1:48:52.720]  trump
[1:48:52.720 --> 1:48:54.720]  you can type into google
[1:48:54.720 --> 1:48:56.720]  it's just Alex Jones KKK CNN
[1:48:56.720 --> 1:48:58.720]  and they just put lower third
[1:48:58.720 --> 1:49:00.720]  Alex Jones KKK
[1:49:00.720 --> 1:49:02.720]  oh it was a mistake
[1:49:02.720 --> 1:49:04.720]  but that's the type of stuff they pull folks
[1:49:04.720 --> 1:49:06.720]  that's the type of deception
[1:49:06.720 --> 1:49:08.720]  that these scumbags
[1:49:08.720 --> 1:49:10.720]  are involved in
[1:49:10.720 --> 1:49:12.720]  and that's why they're so bad
[1:49:12.720 --> 1:49:14.720]  there it is former KKK leader
[1:49:14.720 --> 1:49:16.720]  Alex Jones
[1:49:16.720 --> 1:49:18.720]  now think about that
[1:49:18.720 --> 1:49:20.720]  if you're a literature get to see it for yourself
[1:49:20.720 --> 1:49:22.720]  you can just type it in Alex Jones
[1:49:22.720 --> 1:49:24.720]  former KKK leader
[1:49:24.720 --> 1:49:26.720]  and I have people come out to be on the street
[1:49:26.720 --> 1:49:28.720]  and they go FU you Russian
[1:49:28.720 --> 1:49:30.720]  or FU KKK
[1:49:30.720 --> 1:49:32.720]  and I'm just going
[1:49:32.720 --> 1:49:34.720]  I'm going to play this next hour
[1:49:34.720 --> 1:49:36.720]  maybe we'll go a little bit over
[1:49:36.720 --> 1:49:38.720]  but if you have to go it's fine
[1:49:38.720 --> 1:49:40.720]  Obama at the globalist James Baker event
[1:49:40.720 --> 1:49:42.720]  in Houston last night
[1:49:42.720 --> 1:49:44.720]  and he's talking about how horrible Republicans
[1:49:44.720 --> 1:49:46.720]  are and how they try to keep Jim Crow in place
[1:49:46.720 --> 1:49:48.720]  well anybody that knows history knows it's the opposite
[1:49:48.720 --> 1:49:50.720]  but that's what's so crazy
[1:49:50.720 --> 1:49:52.720]  they'll show you Jim Acosta
[1:49:52.720 --> 1:49:54.720]  grabbing the microwave asking for questions
[1:49:54.720 --> 1:49:56.720]  pushing her arm down
[1:49:56.720 --> 1:49:58.720]  and then they say
[1:49:58.720 --> 1:50:00.720]  he didn't touch her and that I faked the video
[1:50:00.720 --> 1:50:02.720]  so Will Johnson are they
[1:50:02.720 --> 1:50:04.720]  going to win what do you think the point of this
[1:50:04.720 --> 1:50:06.720]  level of lying is what is the
[1:50:06.720 --> 1:50:08.720]  point of leaving and I'm not saying take them down
[1:50:08.720 --> 1:50:10.720]  Lewis Farrakhan
[1:50:10.720 --> 1:50:12.720]  David Duke
[1:50:12.720 --> 1:50:14.720]  I mean I say leave anybody up
[1:50:14.720 --> 1:50:16.720]  as long as they're not calling for violence
[1:50:16.720 --> 1:50:18.720]  all these New York Times board members
[1:50:18.720 --> 1:50:20.720]  saying whites are subhuman and all this
[1:50:20.720 --> 1:50:22.720]  what's behind all this and where do you think it's going
[1:50:22.720 --> 1:50:24.720]  and what is the tactic they're using of just
[1:50:24.720 --> 1:50:26.720]  total lies
[1:50:26.720 --> 1:50:28.720]  you know the whole thing
[1:50:28.720 --> 1:50:30.720]  is being driven by Satan himself
[1:50:30.720 --> 1:50:32.720]  he's the ultimate deceiver
[1:50:32.720 --> 1:50:34.720]  he has control
[1:50:34.720 --> 1:50:36.720]  of the mainstream media
[1:50:36.720 --> 1:50:38.720]  and the mainstream media is deceiving the masses
[1:50:38.720 --> 1:50:40.720]  and
[1:50:40.720 --> 1:50:42.720]  as far as Google and Facebook
[1:50:42.720 --> 1:50:44.720]  and Twitter
[1:50:44.720 --> 1:50:46.720]  I did another report where I was talking about
[1:50:46.720 --> 1:50:48.720]  how George Soros even admitted that these companies
[1:50:48.720 --> 1:50:50.720]  pretty much need to go away
[1:50:50.720 --> 1:50:52.720]  because they made an outlet for people
[1:50:52.720 --> 1:50:54.720]  such as myself for you
[1:50:54.720 --> 1:50:56.720]  for conservatives to reach more people
[1:50:56.720 --> 1:50:58.720]  and it became a major problem
[1:50:58.720 --> 1:51:00.720]  for them so they're calling
[1:51:00.720 --> 1:51:02.720]  for these companies to be removed
[1:51:02.720 --> 1:51:04.720]  and be replaced by something that they could control
[1:51:04.720 --> 1:51:06.720]  more they've created
[1:51:06.720 --> 1:51:08.720]  public squares for us to talk
[1:51:08.720 --> 1:51:10.720]  so they and when they created
[1:51:10.720 --> 1:51:12.720]  these public squares they didn't intend for us
[1:51:12.720 --> 1:51:14.720]  to have communication the way that
[1:51:14.720 --> 1:51:16.720]  we do
[1:51:16.720 --> 1:51:18.720]  they want the deception to keep going
[1:51:18.720 --> 1:51:20.720]  just like you just said
[1:51:20.720 --> 1:51:22.720]  they are deceiving all of us
[1:51:22.720 --> 1:51:24.720]  and a lot of people even know it
[1:51:24.720 --> 1:51:26.720]  but they still go right along with it
[1:51:26.720 --> 1:51:28.720]  it's almost like they rather believe the lie than believe the truth
[1:51:28.720 --> 1:51:30.720]  and that's why they turn it around
[1:51:30.720 --> 1:51:32.720]  when you've got Charlie Brown
[1:51:32.720 --> 1:51:34.720]  Christmas and it's made by Christians
[1:51:34.720 --> 1:51:36.720]  showing whites and blacks together
[1:51:36.720 --> 1:51:38.720]  loving God that has to be called racist
[1:51:38.720 --> 1:51:40.720]  because it's not it's the opposite
[1:51:40.720 --> 1:51:42.720]  yeah it's the opposite
[1:51:42.720 --> 1:51:44.720]  they've taken everything
[1:51:44.720 --> 1:51:46.720]  that was good and they've twisted it
[1:51:46.720 --> 1:51:48.720]  to their own liking
[1:51:48.720 --> 1:51:50.720]  I mean they've taken not to be like
[1:51:50.720 --> 1:51:52.720]  picking on anyone but they've taken the rainbow
[1:51:52.720 --> 1:51:54.720]  they tell them little boys
[1:51:54.720 --> 1:51:56.720]  that they can be little girls
[1:51:56.720 --> 1:51:58.720]  they tell them little girls they can be little boys
[1:51:58.720 --> 1:52:00.720]  they've taken everything and twisted
[1:52:00.720 --> 1:52:02.720]  even the word even Flintstones
[1:52:02.720 --> 1:52:04.720]  I used to watch Flintstones when I was a kid
[1:52:04.720 --> 1:52:06.720]  we all had the gay old time
[1:52:06.720 --> 1:52:08.720]  I mean you're happy they've taken
[1:52:08.720 --> 1:52:10.720]  and they've twisted it for their own
[1:52:10.720 --> 1:52:12.720]  perverted reasons
[1:52:12.720 --> 1:52:14.720]  I forgot about that
[1:52:14.720 --> 1:52:16.720]  yes exactly
[1:52:16.720 --> 1:52:18.720]  and I thought it was supposed to be happy
[1:52:18.720 --> 1:52:20.720]  but see that's the point
[1:52:20.720 --> 1:52:22.720]  take everything that is good
[1:52:22.720 --> 1:52:24.720]  and make it into their own image
[1:52:24.720 --> 1:52:26.720]  and see that's exactly what Satan is doing
[1:52:26.720 --> 1:52:28.720]  Satan wants to destroy the family unit
[1:52:28.720 --> 1:52:30.720]  Satan wants to destroy everything
[1:52:30.720 --> 1:52:32.720]  that God deems good
[1:52:32.720 --> 1:52:34.720]  and make it for his own
[1:52:34.720 --> 1:52:36.720]  and we're seeing it happen
[1:52:36.720 --> 1:52:38.720]  you're doing an awesome job
[1:52:38.720 --> 1:52:40.720]  you're doing wonderful things
[1:52:40.720 --> 1:52:42.720]  and I truly believe you're doing God's work
[1:52:42.720 --> 1:52:44.720]  and they see it
[1:52:44.720 --> 1:52:46.720]  and they don't like it so what do they do
[1:52:46.720 --> 1:52:48.720]  they want to attack you
[1:52:48.720 --> 1:52:50.720]  they want to attack us
[1:52:50.720 --> 1:52:52.720]  they want to attack everyone that doesn't speak like them
[1:52:52.720 --> 1:52:54.720]  that doesn't think like them
[1:52:54.720 --> 1:52:56.720]  they go all out their way to do it
[1:52:56.720 --> 1:52:58.720]  and you know George Soros even admitted
[1:52:58.720 --> 1:53:00.720]  that their agenda
[1:53:00.720 --> 1:53:02.720]  is to remove these platforms
[1:53:02.720 --> 1:53:04.720]  on them speaking
[1:53:04.720 --> 1:53:06.720]  freely
[1:53:06.720 --> 1:53:08.720]  and it's a problem to them
[1:53:08.720 --> 1:53:10.720]  they don't like it
[1:53:10.720 --> 1:53:12.720]  and you know what
[1:53:12.720 --> 1:53:14.720]  I like the fact that
[1:53:14.720 --> 1:53:16.720]  I keep doing it
[1:53:16.720 --> 1:53:18.720]  and they keep attacking me
[1:53:18.720 --> 1:53:20.720]  and that just lets me know
[1:53:20.720 --> 1:53:22.720]  that I'm doing the right thing
[1:53:22.720 --> 1:53:24.720]  and when they stop attacking me
[1:53:24.720 --> 1:53:26.720]  then okay wait a minute what am I not doing
[1:53:26.720 --> 1:53:28.720]  because I'm not on my A game
[1:53:28.720 --> 1:53:30.720]  I need to pick it up
[1:53:30.720 --> 1:53:32.720]  I'm not on my A game
[1:53:32.720 --> 1:53:34.720]  and as long as you keep doing it
[1:53:34.720 --> 1:53:36.720]  and as long as you keep speaking the truth
[1:53:36.720 --> 1:53:38.720]  and as long as you keep exposing these evil people
[1:53:38.720 --> 1:53:40.720]  they're going to keep attacking me
[1:53:40.720 --> 1:53:42.720]  but will I want to be clear
[1:53:42.720 --> 1:53:44.720]  because okay M4s is important and I'm important
[1:53:44.720 --> 1:53:46.720]  but M4s is you
[1:53:46.720 --> 1:53:48.720]  M4s is all of us they hate
[1:53:48.720 --> 1:53:50.720]  like you said us having a community
[1:53:50.720 --> 1:53:52.720]  it's not me and again I want to get credit here
[1:53:52.720 --> 1:53:54.720]  but I'm telling you it's all of us together
[1:53:54.720 --> 1:53:56.720]  and the spirit we have of wanting a future together
[1:53:56.720 --> 1:53:58.720]  of actually loving each other
[1:53:58.720 --> 1:54:00.720]  having our own territory
[1:54:00.720 --> 1:54:02.720]  having our own views but believing in others
[1:54:02.720 --> 1:54:04.720]  and not wanting to deceive other people
[1:54:04.720 --> 1:54:06.720]  wanting to empower other people
[1:54:06.720 --> 1:54:08.720]  because we're confident
[1:54:08.720 --> 1:54:10.720]  we're not these globalists that actually
[1:54:10.720 --> 1:54:12.720]  want to keep people dumb
[1:54:12.720 --> 1:54:14.720]  Yeah I mean you're absolutely right
[1:54:14.720 --> 1:54:16.720]  I mean you know
[1:54:16.720 --> 1:54:18.720]  I still say the Democrats is a domestic terrorist
[1:54:18.720 --> 1:54:20.720]  group that's operating
[1:54:20.720 --> 1:54:22.720]  in America
[1:54:22.720 --> 1:54:24.720]  and they are deceiving
[1:54:24.720 --> 1:54:26.720]  I mean I'm pretty sure you saw the video clip
[1:54:26.720 --> 1:54:28.720]  mostly saying this is what we do
[1:54:28.720 --> 1:54:30.720]  we send the information to the media
[1:54:30.720 --> 1:54:32.720]  and then they run with it
[1:54:32.720 --> 1:54:34.720]  and then when it comes back in full circle
[1:54:34.720 --> 1:54:36.720]  and then we just play off of it
[1:54:36.720 --> 1:54:38.720]  like we didn't put it out there
[1:54:38.720 --> 1:54:40.720]  It's deception in our face
[1:54:40.720 --> 1:54:42.720]  they're not hiding it any longer
[1:54:42.720 --> 1:54:44.720]  we're in a day in age 2018
[1:54:44.720 --> 1:54:46.720]  Donald J. Trump
[1:54:46.720 --> 1:54:48.720]  he didn't create the Democrat craziness party
[1:54:48.720 --> 1:54:50.720]  he exposed it
[1:54:50.720 --> 1:54:52.720]  and you know what
[1:54:52.720 --> 1:54:54.720]  more and more people
[1:54:54.720 --> 1:54:56.720]  started paying attention to politics
[1:54:56.720 --> 1:54:58.720]  they started paying attention to the system
[1:54:58.720 --> 1:55:00.720]  they started paying attention to the globalists
[1:55:00.720 --> 1:55:02.720]  they started paying attention
[1:55:02.720 --> 1:55:04.720]  after Donald J. Trump came into power
[1:55:04.720 --> 1:55:06.720]  well not power
[1:55:06.720 --> 1:55:08.720]  I mean they're probably going to take that
[1:55:08.720 --> 1:55:10.720]  No it's true, I mean no no he did come into the power
[1:55:10.720 --> 1:55:12.720]  of the presidency and the power of the people
[1:55:12.720 --> 1:55:14.720]  and they're scared of the people getting back in a position
[1:55:14.720 --> 1:55:16.720]  of power because as Trump said
[1:55:16.720 --> 1:55:18.720]  I'm here to transfer the power back to you
[1:55:18.720 --> 1:55:20.720]  and he's trying to do it
[1:55:20.720 --> 1:55:22.720]  Yes and you know what
[1:55:22.720 --> 1:55:24.720]  Donald J. Trump came on your broadcast
[1:55:24.720 --> 1:55:26.720]  that was it
[1:55:26.720 --> 1:55:28.720]  they said okay that was it
[1:55:28.720 --> 1:55:30.720]  he's given Alex Jones credibility
[1:55:30.720 --> 1:55:32.720]  and you know what you already had it
[1:55:32.720 --> 1:55:34.720]  you didn't need him to come on for that
[1:55:34.720 --> 1:55:36.720]  but it was awesome that he did
[1:55:36.720 --> 1:55:38.720]  and you know just to
[1:55:38.720 --> 1:55:40.720]  just kind of change the subject just a little bit
[1:55:40.720 --> 1:55:42.720]  when you send out
[1:55:42.720 --> 1:55:44.720]  when info war sends out hundreds of emails
[1:55:44.720 --> 1:55:46.720]  to Julia Sons to try to get an interview
[1:55:46.720 --> 1:55:48.720]  that doesn't mean you're trying to collude with Russia
[1:55:48.720 --> 1:55:50.720]  you're trying to hack the DNC or any of that
[1:55:50.720 --> 1:55:52.720]  that means you're looking
[1:55:52.720 --> 1:55:54.720]  you're seeking for the truth
[1:55:54.720 --> 1:55:56.720]  you're seeking for information
[1:55:56.720 --> 1:55:58.720]  and that's all we're trying to do
[1:55:58.720 --> 1:56:00.720]  that's why it is the information
[1:56:00.720 --> 1:56:02.720]  info wars
[1:56:02.720 --> 1:56:04.720]  and you're absolutely right
[1:56:04.720 --> 1:56:06.720]  as far as it's affecting all of us
[1:56:06.720 --> 1:56:08.720]  the reason why I started speaking out
[1:56:08.720 --> 1:56:10.720]  is because I have a family
[1:56:10.720 --> 1:56:12.720]  I love my family
[1:56:12.720 --> 1:56:14.720]  I love the American people
[1:56:14.720 --> 1:56:16.720]  and the reason why I started speaking out
[1:56:16.720 --> 1:56:18.720]  because I saw the craziness
[1:56:18.720 --> 1:56:20.720]  that it is due
[1:56:20.720 --> 1:56:22.720]  you used to say it all the time
[1:56:22.720 --> 1:56:24.720]  I haven't heard you say it in a while
[1:56:24.720 --> 1:56:26.720]  because you've been extremely busy doing your thing
[1:56:26.720 --> 1:56:28.720]  but you used to say it all the time
[1:56:28.720 --> 1:56:30.720]  do your thing, do videos
[1:56:30.720 --> 1:56:32.720]  get the message out there
[1:56:32.720 --> 1:56:34.720]  spread the info wars
[1:56:34.720 --> 1:56:36.720]  spread it, spread it, spread it
[1:56:36.720 --> 1:56:38.720]  I took heed
[1:56:38.720 --> 1:56:40.720]  I started speaking out
[1:56:40.720 --> 1:56:42.720]  but I had this knot in me
[1:56:42.720 --> 1:56:44.720]  I had this knot in my chest telling me to do it
[1:56:44.720 --> 1:56:46.720]  you planted the seed
[1:56:46.720 --> 1:56:48.720]  and you just started saying something
[1:56:48.720 --> 1:56:50.720]  you've got to engage
[1:56:50.720 --> 1:56:52.720]  you've got to say something that's positive
[1:56:52.720 --> 1:56:54.720]  to a lot of people because a lot of people are like
[1:56:54.720 --> 1:56:56.720]  losing hope
[1:56:56.720 --> 1:56:58.720]  you're right and that's why this is so critical
[1:56:58.720 --> 1:57:00.720]  don't take the censorship forces we're being beaten
[1:57:00.720 --> 1:57:02.720]  the fact that they've had to do this is a major
[1:57:02.720 --> 1:57:04.720]  Streisand effect gamble
[1:57:04.720 --> 1:57:06.720]  it means everybody, no matter what color you are
[1:57:06.720 --> 1:57:08.720]  or where you came from
[1:57:08.720 --> 1:57:10.720]  if you love liberty, you love God, you love justice
[1:57:10.720 --> 1:57:12.720]  whether it's on the street corner at its city council
[1:57:12.720 --> 1:57:14.720]  or calling c-span
[1:57:14.720 --> 1:57:16.720]  everything together changes the world
[1:57:16.720 --> 1:57:18.720]  start communicating, start getting involved
[1:57:18.720 --> 1:57:20.720]  start reaching out and together
[1:57:20.720 --> 1:57:22.720]  we're going to, again all over the world
[1:57:22.720 --> 1:57:24.720]  nationalists, Christians are getting elected
[1:57:24.720 --> 1:57:26.720]  we'll be right back with Will Johnson
[1:57:26.720 --> 1:57:28.720]  stay with us, here is the old
[1:57:28.720 --> 1:57:30.720]  funstone we talked about
[1:57:30.720 --> 1:57:48.720]  love a gay old time
[1:57:48.720 --> 1:57:50.720]  at the end of the day
[1:57:50.720 --> 1:57:52.720]  to still get to the gym or to go for a run
[1:57:52.720 --> 1:57:54.720]  or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk
[1:57:54.720 --> 1:57:56.720]  believe me, I know
[1:57:56.720 --> 1:57:58.720]  I spend hours in front of a screen
[1:57:58.720 --> 1:58:00.720]  and then hours in front of bright lights
[1:58:00.720 --> 1:58:01.720]  every day
[1:58:01.720 --> 1:58:03.720]  but thanks to supermailvitality

[1:58:09.720 --> 1:58:11.720]  to fight back against the chemicals
[1:58:11.720 --> 1:58:13.720]  and the food and water
[1:58:13.720 --> 1:58:15.720]  to fight back against the modern day lifestyle
[1:58:15.720 --> 1:58:17.720]  with the screen time and the extended hours
[1:58:17.720 --> 1:58:19.720]  to still have the stamina and endurance

[1:59:44.720 --> 1:59:45.720]  because when you take action
[1:59:45.720 --> 1:59:47.720]  nothing on earth can stop you
[1:59:47.720 --> 2:00:09.720]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:00:09.720 --> 2:00:35.720]  music
[2:00:35.720 --> 2:00:36.720]  so there you go
[2:00:36.720 --> 2:00:39.720]  will Johnson made a really good point there
[2:00:39.720 --> 2:00:41.720]  journalist talk show host
[2:00:41.720 --> 2:00:45.720]  that the word gay meant just a happy day
[2:00:45.720 --> 2:00:47.720]  but then groups came and took that over
[2:00:47.720 --> 2:00:49.720]  you're like okay well let people not call themselves
[2:00:49.720 --> 2:00:51.720]  homosexual even though
[2:00:51.720 --> 2:00:53.720]  straights are called heterosexual
[2:00:53.720 --> 2:00:56.720]  but then the scientific word becomes evil
[2:00:56.720 --> 2:00:57.720]  oh now don't use the word homosexual
[2:00:57.720 --> 2:00:59.720]  that scene is hateful
[2:00:59.720 --> 2:01:01.720]  some countries arrest you for saying it
[2:01:01.720 --> 2:01:03.720]  so it's a it's a war on reality
[2:01:03.720 --> 2:01:05.720]  and it's an attempt
[2:01:05.720 --> 2:01:07.720]  to
[2:01:07.720 --> 2:01:10.720]  take over what words you can use
[2:01:10.720 --> 2:01:12.720]  and now you don't use mother or father
[2:01:12.720 --> 2:01:14.720]  so since you brought this up will Johnson
[2:01:14.720 --> 2:01:16.720]  this assault on children
[2:01:16.720 --> 2:01:18.720]  I mean this is diabolical now
[2:01:18.720 --> 2:01:20.720]  when you saw the video
[2:01:20.720 --> 2:01:22.720]  they're having these drag cut
[2:01:22.720 --> 2:01:24.720]  and drag queen story time
[2:01:24.720 --> 2:01:26.720]  and it's literally weird men
[2:01:26.720 --> 2:01:29.720]  it's men that usually are predators on children
[2:01:29.720 --> 2:01:31.720]  dressed up like women
[2:01:31.720 --> 2:01:34.720]  coming in and trying to talk to little kids about sex
[2:01:34.720 --> 2:01:36.720]  imagine if you or I which we never do
[2:01:36.720 --> 2:01:37.720]  show up in a park and walked over
[2:01:37.720 --> 2:01:39.720]  imagine if you didn't know me from Adam
[2:01:39.720 --> 2:01:40.720]  even if you knew me and I was Alex Jones
[2:01:40.720 --> 2:01:41.720]  and I walked over here in a park
[2:01:41.720 --> 2:01:44.720]  say in San Francisco or wherever you live at
[2:01:44.720 --> 2:01:46.720]  and I walked over and I said hey Will
[2:01:46.720 --> 2:01:48.720]  let me talk to your kids about sex
[2:01:48.720 --> 2:01:49.720]  you're like that's a little weird man
[2:01:49.720 --> 2:01:51.720]  that's what I try to say I'm gonna
[2:01:51.720 --> 2:01:52.720]  you need to get out of here
[2:01:52.720 --> 2:01:53.720]  if I didn't stop you punched me in the nose
[2:01:53.720 --> 2:01:54.720]  and you should
[2:01:54.720 --> 2:01:56.720]  but if they go oh it's school sponsored
[2:01:56.720 --> 2:01:58.720]  we're gonna have men dressed like women
[2:01:58.720 --> 2:02:00.720]  come tell your kids they're another sex
[2:02:00.720 --> 2:02:04.720]  this is unbelievably abusive
[2:02:04.720 --> 2:02:07.720]  you're absolutely right again
[2:02:07.720 --> 2:02:11.720]  you know even going with the Macy's Parade
[2:02:11.720 --> 2:02:13.720]  the Macy's Parade is supposed to just
[2:02:13.720 --> 2:02:15.720]  be a family event it's not supposed to be
[2:02:15.720 --> 2:02:18.720]  interjecting sexual relations or any of that
[2:02:18.720 --> 2:02:22.720]  they had a huge exhibit of homosexuality
[2:02:22.720 --> 2:02:24.720]  parading before children and kids
[2:02:24.720 --> 2:02:26.720]  and at the end of it they're like kissing
[2:02:26.720 --> 2:02:28.720]  why are they teaching children this
[2:02:28.720 --> 2:02:30.720]  in the state of California where I'm at
[2:02:30.720 --> 2:02:33.720]  they're getting ready to
[2:02:33.720 --> 2:02:35.720]  they've already ruled it to put in a curriculum
[2:02:35.720 --> 2:02:38.720]  to teach children about homosexuality
[2:02:38.720 --> 2:02:40.720]  and have to have the sexual acts
[2:02:40.720 --> 2:02:42.720]  this is the world we live in
[2:02:42.720 --> 2:02:44.720]  I mean my god and I did see the clip
[2:02:44.720 --> 2:02:46.720]  where the gentleman talking about
[2:02:46.720 --> 2:02:48.720]  yeah we need to show children that
[2:02:48.720 --> 2:02:50.720]  this is all loving and show great
[2:02:50.720 --> 2:02:52.720]  transgender sexing and groom them
[2:02:52.720 --> 2:02:54.720]  and the reason why I believe that
[2:02:54.720 --> 2:02:56.720]  they're doing it because if they groom them
[2:02:56.720 --> 2:02:59.720]  at this age now 5, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1
[2:02:59.720 --> 2:03:02.720]  when they become adults, young adults
[2:03:02.720 --> 2:03:04.720]  16, 18, 20
[2:03:04.720 --> 2:03:07.720]  they will be
[2:03:07.720 --> 2:03:09.720]  desensitized to it
[2:03:09.720 --> 2:03:10.720]  they will be like you know what
[2:03:10.720 --> 2:03:11.720]  there's always been here
[2:03:11.720 --> 2:03:13.720]  I look in the sky and I see an airplane
[2:03:13.720 --> 2:03:14.720]  and I don't get shocked
[2:03:14.720 --> 2:03:17.720]  when I see the videos with the guy
[2:03:17.720 --> 2:03:19.720]  looking at them and I was watching your show
[2:03:19.720 --> 2:03:22.720]  and you had the beautiful
[2:03:22.720 --> 2:03:23.720]  lady from Canada on
[2:03:23.720 --> 2:03:26.720]  and you were talking about
[2:03:26.720 --> 2:03:27.720]  and they were showing it
[2:03:27.720 --> 2:03:28.720]  and I was just like god
[2:03:28.720 --> 2:03:29.720]  I was covering my mouth
[2:03:29.720 --> 2:03:31.720]  not wanting to throw up
[2:03:31.720 --> 2:03:33.720]  how they were trying to push this
[2:03:33.720 --> 2:03:34.720]  onto our children
[2:03:34.720 --> 2:03:36.720]  this is going to affect the people
[2:03:36.720 --> 2:03:38.720]  like never before
[2:03:38.720 --> 2:03:40.720]  and you're right when they fillet
[2:03:40.720 --> 2:03:42.720]  these men and then you know
[2:03:42.720 --> 2:03:44.720]  within a year a lot of them do
[2:03:44.720 --> 2:03:45.720]  they want to commit suicide
[2:03:45.720 --> 2:03:47.720]  they end up in mental institutions
[2:03:47.720 --> 2:03:49.720]  it's horrible
[2:03:49.720 --> 2:03:51.720]  and they're pushing it like oh this is wonderful
[2:03:51.720 --> 2:03:53.720]  you're so brave
[2:03:53.720 --> 2:03:55.720]  how is that bravery
[2:03:55.720 --> 2:03:56.720]  I don't understand
[2:03:56.720 --> 2:03:57.720]  and how can a six year old
[2:03:57.720 --> 2:03:58.720]  make the decision
[2:03:58.720 --> 2:03:59.720]  they want their genitals cut off
[2:03:59.720 --> 2:04:00.720]  their Johnson cut off
[2:04:00.720 --> 2:04:01.720]  no pun intended
[2:04:01.720 --> 2:04:03.720]  and then the dad doesn't want it
[2:04:03.720 --> 2:04:05.720]  so the kid's taken from dad
[2:04:05.720 --> 2:04:07.720]  yes it's crazy
[2:04:07.720 --> 2:04:09.720]  I mean how does that happen
[2:04:09.720 --> 2:04:11.720]  and you know you can't say him
[2:04:11.720 --> 2:04:12.720]  you can't say her
[2:04:12.720 --> 2:04:14.720]  you can no longer say father
[2:04:14.720 --> 2:04:15.720]  you can no longer say mother
[2:04:15.720 --> 2:04:16.720]  what can we say
[2:04:16.720 --> 2:04:17.720]  it's a cult saying this
[2:04:17.720 --> 2:04:19.720]  the answer is say whatever we want
[2:04:19.720 --> 2:04:20.720]  stand up against them
[2:04:20.720 --> 2:04:21.720]  Bill Johnson
[2:04:21.720 --> 2:04:22.720]  UnitedAmericanfirst.com
[2:04:22.720 --> 2:04:23.720]  amazing job
[2:04:23.720 --> 2:04:24.720]  please join us again very soon
[2:04:24.720 --> 2:04:25.720]  and we'll continue to track
[2:04:25.720 --> 2:04:26.720]  all the great reports and work
[2:04:26.720 --> 2:04:27.720]  you do there
[2:04:27.720 --> 2:04:28.720]  and your whole breakdown
[2:04:28.720 --> 2:04:29.720]  on Charlie Brown
[2:04:29.720 --> 2:04:30.720]  is Christian not racist
[2:04:30.720 --> 2:04:31.720]  God bless you
[2:04:31.720 --> 2:04:33.720]  absolutely thank you for having me
[2:04:33.720 --> 2:04:34.720]  it's an honor and a blessing
[2:04:34.720 --> 2:04:35.720]  to be with you
[2:04:35.720 --> 2:04:36.720]  honor and blessing to be with you
[2:04:36.720 --> 2:04:38.720]  okay things happen
[2:04:38.720 --> 2:04:39.720]  I don't just build stuff up
[2:04:39.720 --> 2:04:40.720]  and make you wait
[2:04:40.720 --> 2:04:41.720]  we were supposed to have
[2:04:41.720 --> 2:04:42.720]  this big live event
[2:04:42.720 --> 2:04:43.720]  in the last 15 minutes
[2:04:43.720 --> 2:04:45.720]  there's traffic in a major city
[2:04:45.720 --> 2:04:46.720]  not supposed to say a word
[2:04:46.720 --> 2:04:48.720]  they're behind
[2:04:48.720 --> 2:04:49.720]  but it's going to be happening
[2:04:49.720 --> 2:04:51.720]  in 30 minutes or so
[2:04:51.720 --> 2:04:52.720]  hopefully
[2:04:52.720 --> 2:04:53.720]  and we're going to cover it live
[2:04:53.720 --> 2:04:54.720]  here on air
[2:04:54.720 --> 2:04:55.720]  and we've got a lot more coming up
[2:04:55.720 --> 2:04:57.720]  the globalists know
[2:04:57.720 --> 2:04:59.720]  that if they suppress the good halogen
[2:04:59.720 --> 2:05:00.720]  and pump the environment
[2:05:00.720 --> 2:05:01.720]  full of the bad halogens
[2:05:01.720 --> 2:05:02.720]  fluoride chlorine bromide
[2:05:02.720 --> 2:05:03.720]  you name it
[2:05:03.720 --> 2:05:05.720]  that it lowers IQ
[2:05:05.720 --> 2:05:07.720]  it literally dumps the population down
[2:05:07.720 --> 2:05:09.720]  and on our quest to bring
[2:05:09.720 --> 2:05:10.720]  our listeners and viewers
[2:05:10.720 --> 2:05:12.720]  the best iodine in the world
[2:05:12.720 --> 2:05:14.720]  we've gone through two permutations
[2:05:14.720 --> 2:05:16.720]  first seaweed based iodine
[2:05:16.720 --> 2:05:17.720]  that was pretty good
[2:05:17.720 --> 2:05:18.720]  but hard to source
[2:05:18.720 --> 2:05:19.720]  and the globalists tried to block us
[2:05:19.720 --> 2:05:20.720]  getting a supply of it
[2:05:20.720 --> 2:05:22.720]  so we discovered deep earth crystals
[2:05:22.720 --> 2:05:24.720]  a pure nascent iodine
[2:05:24.720 --> 2:05:25.720]  and brought you X2
[2:05:25.720 --> 2:05:26.720]  that's been incredible
[2:05:26.720 --> 2:05:28.720]  now due to the establishment
[2:05:28.720 --> 2:05:29.720]  trying to block that
[2:05:29.720 --> 2:05:30.720]  we did more research
[2:05:30.720 --> 2:05:31.720]  and secured
[2:05:31.720 --> 2:05:33.720]  more of the deep earth crystals
[2:05:33.720 --> 2:05:34.720]  of nascent iodine
[2:05:34.720 --> 2:05:35.720]  but
[2:05:35.720 --> 2:05:36.720]  chemists, scientists and others
[2:05:36.720 --> 2:05:37.720]  showed us the research
[2:05:37.720 --> 2:05:38.720]  that by combining it
[2:05:38.720 --> 2:05:40.720]  with three other compounds
[2:05:40.720 --> 2:05:41.720]  two forms of iodine
[2:05:41.720 --> 2:05:42.720]  and vitamin C
[2:05:42.720 --> 2:05:44.720]  it super charges it
[2:05:44.720 --> 2:05:46.720]  and makes it even more
[2:05:46.720 --> 2:05:48.720]  bio available
[2:05:48.720 --> 2:05:49.720]  ladies and gentlemen
[2:05:49.720 --> 2:05:50.720]  you want to research it
[2:05:50.720 --> 2:05:51.720]  you want to see it
[2:05:51.720 --> 2:05:52.720]  it's an incredible discovery
[2:05:52.720 --> 2:05:53.720]  X3
[2:05:53.720 --> 2:06:16.720]  now available at m4slife.com
[2:06:23.720 --> 2:06:29.720]  I'm standing in this breathing room
[2:06:29.720 --> 2:06:30.720]  right now
[2:06:30.720 --> 2:06:31.720]  there is no government official here
[2:06:31.720 --> 2:06:33.720]  but I'll say
[2:06:33.720 --> 2:06:36.720]  that the press is not the enemy of the people
[2:06:36.720 --> 2:06:48.720]  but I'll say
[2:06:48.720 --> 2:06:50.720]  that the press is not the enemy of the people
[2:06:50.720 --> 2:06:52.720]  the press is not the enemy of the people
[2:06:52.720 --> 2:06:54.720]  the press is not the enemy of the people
[2:06:54.720 --> 2:06:56.720]  the press is not the enemy of the people
[2:06:56.720 --> 2:06:58.720]  they came in peace
[2:07:16.720 --> 2:07:18.720]  maybe we should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue
[2:07:18.720 --> 2:07:20.720]  like these folks who chant CNN sucks
[2:07:20.720 --> 2:07:26.880]  Chant CNN sucks and fake news, maybe we should go out, all journalists should go out on Pennsylvania
[2:07:26.880 --> 2:07:41.080]  Avenue and chant, we're not the enemy of the people.
[2:07:41.080 --> 2:07:44.120]  We're not the enemy of the people, we're not the enemy of the people, we're not the
[2:07:44.120 --> 2:07:52.800]  enemy of the people.
[2:07:52.800 --> 2:08:04.560]  This is CNN.
[2:08:04.560 --> 2:08:08.160]  They're intentionally leaving the borders open in Europe, bringing in mass refugees,
[2:08:08.160 --> 2:08:12.760]  among them are going to be jihadists, who are setting up a future Ted offensive, Ted
[2:08:12.760 --> 2:08:16.720]  style offensive in Europe, and it's the same things being done to this country.
[2:08:16.720 --> 2:08:24.160]  On her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tender-hearted woman
[2:08:24.160 --> 2:08:27.640]  saw a poor half-rozen snake.
[2:08:27.640 --> 2:08:35.600]  His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with a dew, oh well, she cried, I'll take
[2:08:35.600 --> 2:08:38.920]  you in, and I'll take care of you.
[2:08:38.920 --> 2:08:42.880]  Take me in, oh tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake.
[2:08:42.880 --> 2:08:50.080]  Take me in, oh tender woman, side the vicious snake.
[2:08:50.080 --> 2:08:54.960]  Take me in, oh tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake.
[2:08:54.960 --> 2:09:01.400]  Take me in, oh tender woman, side the vicious snake.
[2:09:01.400 --> 2:09:08.040]  Now she clutched him to her bosom, you're so beautiful, she cried, but if I hadn't brought
[2:09:08.040 --> 2:09:12.380]  you in, by now you might have died.
[2:09:12.380 --> 2:09:19.320]  She stroked his pretty skin, and then she kissed and held him tight, but instead of
[2:09:19.320 --> 2:09:26.360]  saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite.
[2:09:26.360 --> 2:09:32.840]  I saved you, cried the woman, and you've bit me, heaven's wide.
[2:09:32.840 --> 2:09:38.200]  You know your bite is poisonous, and now I'm going to die.
[2:09:38.200 --> 2:09:43.280]  Oh shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin.
[2:09:43.280 --> 2:09:50.160]  You knew damn well I was a snake, before you...
[2:09:50.160 --> 2:09:56.840]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[2:09:56.840 --> 2:09:59.840]  the Info War.
[2:09:59.840 --> 2:10:02.640]  Oh shut up you silly woman.
[2:10:02.640 --> 2:10:07.680]  You knew I was a snake, and you let me in.
[2:10:07.680 --> 2:10:17.400]  Trump is not a snake, Trump is the ghost of Christmas present.
[2:10:17.400 --> 2:10:23.240]  The ghost of the cornucopia, the ghost of America.
[2:10:23.240 --> 2:10:31.200]  One last time, God's promise, that you have to make the choice, but that choice is an
[2:10:31.200 --> 2:10:32.800]  individual choice.
[2:10:32.800 --> 2:10:36.480]  That's what Trump is.
[2:10:36.480 --> 2:10:44.960]  Trump is a pragmatic, down the line, Americana guy, no subterfuge, no manipulation.
[2:10:44.960 --> 2:10:47.920]  He wakes and sees what the enemy's doing, and he responds to it.
[2:10:47.920 --> 2:10:50.080]  So I says I don't punch, I counter punch.
[2:10:50.080 --> 2:10:53.560]  And they'll go oh it's three dimensional chess, it's all this other stuff.
[2:10:53.560 --> 2:10:55.640]  No it's not.
[2:10:55.640 --> 2:10:57.480]  They're trying to do three dimensional chess.
[2:10:57.480 --> 2:11:01.600]  Trump is trying to do the right thing, and he believes you're trying to do the right
[2:11:01.600 --> 2:11:04.920]  thing.
[2:11:04.920 --> 2:11:08.480]  But now they've raided one of hundreds of lawyers he has, it's in real estate, for
[2:11:08.480 --> 2:11:17.960]  20 years for him in Chicago where he owns five or six buildings, including Trump Tower.
[2:11:17.960 --> 2:11:22.680]  About a year ago, the guy, this is himself, was Trump, and I'm on a big shot like Trump
[2:11:22.680 --> 2:11:25.440]  in business, but in life, in lawsuits and things.
[2:11:25.440 --> 2:11:28.720]  When you get sued in a town, or a business in a town, you get the lawyer in that town.
[2:11:28.720 --> 2:11:34.440]  But how this works is, Trump has hundreds of lawyers handling major business in cities
[2:11:34.440 --> 2:11:42.880]  for him, and then all Mueller and the globalists do is go through their background, find something,
[2:11:42.880 --> 2:11:46.480]  raid them for what they've supposedly done, like Cohen not paying $15 million, he blood
[2:11:46.480 --> 2:11:52.960]  guilty too, in taxes at a taxicab place he own part of, and then he rolls on Trump and
[2:11:52.960 --> 2:11:55.120]  makes a bunch of lies.
[2:11:55.120 --> 2:12:00.560]  Now you've got this latest lawyer raided in Chicago, and I'm not saying a Chicago top
[2:12:00.560 --> 2:12:05.720]  real estate lawyer is doing anything wrong, and I'm not saying bears live in the woods,
[2:12:05.720 --> 2:12:09.520]  or that they go bathroom in the woods, or whatever they do in the woods, I'm just saying
[2:12:09.520 --> 2:12:15.240]  this is incredibly transparent, and what I do know is this, it's real simple.
[2:12:15.240 --> 2:12:25.400]  It has nothing to do with a gigantic country that is the largest country in the world called
[2:12:25.400 --> 2:12:27.960]  Russia.
[2:12:27.960 --> 2:12:37.880]  That I know, but see, remember what the globalists always say, memories, and having a memory
[2:12:37.880 --> 2:12:41.720]  is the friend of Providence.
[2:12:41.720 --> 2:12:46.520]  Memories are consciousness, memories are having a grasp, having a memory, and a memory is a
[2:12:46.520 --> 2:12:47.520]  trained thing.
[2:12:47.520 --> 2:12:50.400]  All of us are genetically exposed to have a good memory or not have a good memory.
[2:12:50.400 --> 2:12:54.160]  Mine was photographic until about 30, and then that's when you start having massive
[2:12:54.160 --> 2:12:58.280]  brain cell death every day on average, and I certainly helped that along in many different
[2:12:58.280 --> 2:13:07.080]  ways, both traumatic physically and chemical, because alcohol is not good for your brain
[2:13:07.080 --> 2:13:11.120]  overall, but the point I'm getting in here is, it was kind of nice to lose the photographic
[2:13:11.120 --> 2:13:12.120]  memory.
[2:13:12.120 --> 2:13:19.840]  I mean, it was photographic, not anymore, but it's still extremely good, and that's
[2:13:19.840 --> 2:13:26.200]  what I deal with every day, and see, Trump has an incredible memory as well.
[2:13:26.200 --> 2:13:31.520]  At 72, it's still amazing, and that's why they can't stand him, but he also knows to
[2:13:31.520 --> 2:13:35.200]  always act like he's being recorded or watched, that people are trying to set him up.
[2:13:35.200 --> 2:13:40.720]  You know, that Cohen tape they released earlier this year, it was like, it was in February.
[2:13:40.720 --> 2:13:46.200]  Everything headlines, Cohen caught his lawyer, Trump on tape saying, pay off women, and it's
[2:13:46.200 --> 2:13:47.920]  Cohen going, oh hey, how you doing?
[2:13:47.920 --> 2:13:51.800]  Yeah, we gotta make a payments woman, and Trump's like, no, we're not doing that.
[2:13:51.800 --> 2:13:58.480]  And it's the same thing, I saw this headline this morning, Dr. Corsi admits he lied, ready
[2:13:58.480 --> 2:14:03.160]  to go to prison for life, MSNBC, I set the clip to you guys, and that's the name on their
[2:14:03.160 --> 2:14:07.680]  official MSNBC YouTube site, I should have spring this on you, but try to go to MSNBC's
[2:14:07.680 --> 2:14:13.480]  official site on YouTube, and it's got less subscribers than we ever did, but that's why
[2:14:13.480 --> 2:14:19.520]  they're so jealous, and it's, you know, Corsi admits he lied, ready to go to prison for
[2:14:19.520 --> 2:14:24.080]  life, and then you watch the video and he goes, I never lied, I did nothing wrong, but
[2:14:24.080 --> 2:14:31.120]  that doesn't matter, the headline is, I lied, I'm ready to go to jail, wow, and it's just
[2:14:31.120 --> 2:14:38.320]  whopper after whopper after whopper, and the average person isn't going to watch a 22 minute
[2:14:38.320 --> 2:14:44.160]  clip, and that's the problem with research, is I'm up at 5am, I take a shower, drink and
[2:14:44.160 --> 2:14:47.880]  coffee, I'm about to go exercise, I didn't exercise, because I got caught on that 20
[2:14:47.880 --> 2:14:52.520]  minute clip, and I watched the whole thing, no, and Corsi hadn't said it, and then sure
[2:14:52.520 --> 2:14:59.320]  as hell, he did, he said the opposite, and it's like what murderers of truth, they know
[2:14:59.320 --> 2:15:03.360]  the average person, put it back on screen please, for TV viewers, they know the average
[2:15:03.360 --> 2:15:08.240]  person is not going to watch a 22 minute video, here, let's see if my memory is correct, go
[2:15:08.240 --> 2:15:13.880]  up and see how long it is, 22 minute 5 second, okay, so, they know the average person is
[2:15:13.880 --> 2:15:19.800]  not going to watch a 22 minute video, he says, I did not lie, I told the truth, over and
[2:15:19.800 --> 2:15:23.720]  over again, that turns into, notice there's no quotes around it though, so legally they
[2:15:23.720 --> 2:15:30.280]  can do it, I lied and I'm ready to die in jail, I thought my god, that's contradictory,
[2:15:30.280 --> 2:15:35.560]  has he done it again, I went and looked and he didn't say that, he said the opposite,
[2:15:35.560 --> 2:15:40.240]  he said the sky is blue, and they said Corsi says the sky is red, I'm going to give the
[2:15:40.240 --> 2:15:43.480]  number out when we come back, what do you make of Trump taking the gloves off, getting
[2:15:43.480 --> 2:15:49.120]  ready to go after the deep state, on that specific topic, 877-8789, Alex, 877-8789,
[2:15:49.120 --> 2:15:58.200]  925, 877-8789, 2539, stay with us, what if there was a social media network only for
[2:15:58.200 --> 2:16:02.080]  the conservatives, what if there was a social media network not only for the conservative
[2:16:02.080 --> 2:16:06.520]  right general public, but also a platform for conservative politicians and advertisers,
[2:16:06.520 --> 2:16:11.440]  and what if the social media network was the only free speech network in existence, there
[2:16:11.440 --> 2:16:17.440]  is, it's rightsocial.net, rightsocial.net, a response to President Donald Trump's direct

[2:18:53.120 --> 2:18:56.160]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[2:18:56.160 --> 2:19:01.920]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[2:19:01.920 --> 2:19:05.320]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing, it's a good thing and I've had water filtration
[2:19:05.320 --> 2:19:10.200]  sponsors since the day I got on air and over the years I learned a lot about water filtration,
[2:19:10.200 --> 2:19:11.760]  I learned what the best was.
[2:19:11.760 --> 2:19:16.400]  Now the Alexa Pure pros their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons
[2:19:16.400 --> 2:19:17.400]  an hour.
[2:19:17.400 --> 2:19:20.120]  It's amazing, cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in the good minerals.
[2:19:20.120 --> 2:19:25.400]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at my Patreon supply that have developed these filters, ordered
[2:19:25.400 --> 2:19:27.040]  a huge amount of them this year.
[2:19:27.040 --> 2:19:28.760]  He has a glut of them.
[2:19:28.760 --> 2:19:31.800]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[2:19:31.800 --> 2:19:39.440]  When it's discounted, it's 200, it's 127, he's selling them to us at cost and we're
[2:19:39.440 --> 2:19:41.240]  making 20 something bucks on.
[2:19:41.240 --> 2:19:43.480]  So they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[2:19:43.480 --> 2:19:46.480]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health, it's amazing.
[2:19:46.480 --> 2:20:00.080]  Alexa Pure pro at M4Warslife.com or M4store.com or call 888-253-3139.
[2:20:00.080 --> 2:20:15.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:15.520 --> 2:20:38.520]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:38.520 --> 2:20:46.280]  Can you keep them in the dark for life, can you hide them on the way to the world?
[2:20:46.280 --> 2:20:56.120]  All right, let's go back to your calls or go to your calls, I should say.
[2:20:56.120 --> 2:21:03.000]  If you just tuned in, Trump is getting ready to hammer the Democrats with the secret illegal
[2:21:03.000 --> 2:21:08.000]  fives that Lawrence, the spying, the politicization of it all, he's getting ready to hammer them
[2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:12.120]  with Hillary's real emails that we know the government's had for a long time.
[2:21:12.120 --> 2:21:16.600]  But he's got to do it now before they start all these new fake 80 plus investigations
[2:21:16.600 --> 2:21:21.000]  in January when the Democrats take control of the house.
[2:21:21.000 --> 2:21:22.000]  It's the right thing to do.
[2:21:22.000 --> 2:21:24.640]  They've been, his lawyers have been lying to him.
[2:21:24.640 --> 2:21:28.680]  Everybody else around him has been just trying to hope that, you know, they can stay both
[2:21:28.680 --> 2:21:33.760]  in the White House, but also eat dinner with the Democrats at night and play both sides.
[2:21:33.760 --> 2:21:37.600]  No more of that needs to go after all of them politically.
[2:21:37.600 --> 2:21:38.600]  They're the criminals.
[2:21:38.600 --> 2:21:39.600]  They're the globalists.
[2:21:39.600 --> 2:21:40.600]  They hate America.
[2:21:40.600 --> 2:21:43.120]  They've been selling the country out and just start laying the cards out.
[2:21:43.120 --> 2:21:47.200]  And there's so many cards that it just needs to be done.
[2:21:47.200 --> 2:21:50.600]  We must obliterate all these people politically.
[2:21:50.600 --> 2:21:58.640]  And you saw that with what happened with just the text messages of the deputy director McCabe
[2:21:58.640 --> 2:22:03.920]  and Strock and the rest of them, the stuff that Trump has is devastating.
[2:22:03.920 --> 2:22:05.960]  I've got his quotes here.
[2:22:05.960 --> 2:22:07.800]  He says it's so bad.
[2:22:07.800 --> 2:22:10.600]  He doesn't know if he can release it because it'll hurt the country so bad in the stock
[2:22:10.600 --> 2:22:11.600]  market.
[2:22:11.600 --> 2:22:12.960]  What have I been telling you for a couple of years?
[2:22:12.960 --> 2:22:15.040]  I know what's going on.
[2:22:15.040 --> 2:22:17.920]  This stuff is so horrible.
[2:22:17.920 --> 2:22:25.400]  The Clintons running child kidnapping rings, narcotics trafficking, murder for hire.
[2:22:25.400 --> 2:22:32.320]  But they run it all, folks, and Trump is like, why are you people doing this?
[2:22:32.320 --> 2:22:37.000]  Just stop it and leave the country alone, but they can't stop because they've been getting
[2:22:37.000 --> 2:22:41.240]  away with it so long, they can't help it.
[2:22:41.240 --> 2:22:45.760]  So I say go nuclear and just start releasing everything.
[2:22:45.760 --> 2:22:48.080]  I'd start releasing stuff next week.
[2:22:48.080 --> 2:22:51.120]  They'll say, oh, sir, it's how you release it.
[2:22:51.120 --> 2:22:52.840]  It's the moral authority.
[2:22:52.840 --> 2:22:54.640]  Don't, don't, don't, you know, you have the.
[2:22:54.640 --> 2:22:56.720]  They're not going to change the subject.
[2:22:56.720 --> 2:22:58.720]  Just attack.
[2:22:58.720 --> 2:22:59.720]  That's what built this country.
[2:22:59.720 --> 2:23:02.800]  It was not rolling over but attacking the enemy.
[2:23:02.800 --> 2:23:06.880]  So damn the maneuvers go straight at them and it needs to happen and it's going to happen
[2:23:06.880 --> 2:23:13.120]  because when you're a mental patient like Mueller or Comey or Hillary, these people think they
[2:23:13.120 --> 2:23:14.480]  rule the earth.
[2:23:14.480 --> 2:23:19.880]  These are the most slimy, dirty mentally ill lawyers who've had their asses kissed their
[2:23:19.880 --> 2:23:27.040]  whole life from big, rich blue blood families who think they are invincible.
[2:23:27.040 --> 2:23:30.480]  I mean, I can't tell you how many times, and I'm not the toughest guy around, but some
[2:23:30.480 --> 2:23:36.120]  big tough guy who never had his ass kicked will just keep pushing and getting a fight.
[2:23:36.120 --> 2:23:42.040]  And about the second they actually got anything good on me, I'd just turn on the, you know,
[2:23:42.040 --> 2:23:47.560]  the gorilla juice and I'd black out and they'd be going to the hospital and I'm not talking
[2:23:47.560 --> 2:23:49.440]  about physically fighting Mueller.
[2:23:49.440 --> 2:23:51.520]  I'm saying he's a bully.
[2:23:51.520 --> 2:23:59.640]  These guys are always super confident until they start crying for mommy and they always
[2:23:59.640 --> 2:24:02.480]  cry for their mommy in the end.
[2:24:02.480 --> 2:24:08.040]  Just like Hitler or Mussolini or any of these people, these are crooks that have been running
[2:24:08.040 --> 2:24:12.680]  around in the criminal justice system, feeding on other crooks and mafias and being the king
[2:24:12.680 --> 2:24:16.760]  mafia because they could get away with anything, thinking all the rest of the country's theirs
[2:24:16.760 --> 2:24:23.120]  and thinking they can use mafia tactics on people that aren't criminal thugs like them.
[2:24:23.120 --> 2:24:25.560]  Whitey Bolger, they were getting ready to bring it out that he worked for Mueller.
[2:24:25.560 --> 2:24:27.000]  He got killed in prison.
[2:24:27.000 --> 2:24:28.520]  I'm not Whitey Bolger, man.
[2:24:28.520 --> 2:24:34.040]  I didn't strangle prostitutes for you.
[2:24:34.040 --> 2:24:36.440]  I don't murder women like you, Mueller.
[2:24:36.440 --> 2:24:42.920]  I'm not a knuckle dragon, murderous slimebag coward.
[2:24:42.920 --> 2:24:46.360]  You go around pissing on mobsters all day because you're a bigger mobster.
[2:24:46.360 --> 2:24:52.040]  You're not a cop, you're a piece of trash, you're a piece of garbage, you're a piece
[2:24:52.040 --> 2:25:01.080]  of filth, and I pray that God brings you to justice because God will, but he's only a
[2:25:01.080 --> 2:25:06.080]  little turd that works for him that's supposed to strut around and intimidate everybody
[2:25:06.080 --> 2:25:08.760]  all day and make everybody scared of him.
[2:25:08.760 --> 2:25:09.760]  It's disgusting.
[2:25:09.760 --> 2:25:18.600]  I bet Robert Mueller gets a big brain tumor in the next year, a big one.
[2:25:18.600 --> 2:25:22.520]  He'll be begging for mommy.
[2:25:22.520 --> 2:25:27.640]  That big old juicy brain tumor eats his brain, big old fat one.
[2:25:27.640 --> 2:25:32.280]  I think Robert Mueller's going to get a brain tumor just like John McCain.
[2:25:32.280 --> 2:25:34.040]  I bet he's already got one.
[2:25:34.040 --> 2:25:41.200]  I bet Jesus gave him one.
[2:25:41.200 --> 2:25:43.700]  Yes.
[2:25:43.700 --> 2:25:48.640]  Won't be worried about him too much longer because you see when the devil's done with
[2:25:48.640 --> 2:25:57.120]  somebody, he wipes his ass with him and flushes him down a toilet, and Robert Mueller is already
[2:25:57.120 --> 2:26:00.560]  circling the toilet bowl.
[2:26:00.560 --> 2:26:04.760]  The devil already wiped his big old fat, greasy ass with him.
[2:26:04.760 --> 2:26:14.160]  Okay, I'm going to stop being poetic, I apologize, family show.
[2:26:14.160 --> 2:26:17.160]  Your daddy's waiting, mother.
[2:26:17.160 --> 2:26:28.360]  All right, I'm going to get serious, having a little bit of theatric fun there.
[2:26:28.360 --> 2:26:35.720]  We're going to go to break, we're going to come back, we're going to take your calls,
[2:26:35.720 --> 2:26:40.240]  and we're waiting for this call, this video call to come in, from some interesting activism
[2:26:40.240 --> 2:26:43.920]  that a little birdie told me about, it's going to be happening in a major city where people
[2:26:43.920 --> 2:26:47.440]  got stuck in traffic and other things haven't regardless, and in the next hour we're going
[2:26:47.440 --> 2:26:51.160]  to have this for you if that's what God wants to happen.
[2:26:51.160 --> 2:26:56.400]  But the toll-free number to join us, as I said, is 877-789-ALAX.
[2:26:56.400 --> 2:26:59.240]  I'm surprised we have loaded the phone lines, I just babbled it out a few times before we
[2:26:59.240 --> 2:27:00.240]  went to break, 877-789-2539.
[2:27:00.240 --> 2:27:07.600]  Do you feel the energy, do you see it, and do you agree that Trump needs to release
[2:27:07.600 --> 2:27:14.320]  it all, just hammer them and come out and don't do it through Congress and classification
[2:27:14.320 --> 2:27:20.320]  certifications, he has the power, as the chief executive, his own branch of government, that's
[2:27:20.320 --> 2:27:24.360]  why the president is powerful, to release whatever the hell he wants, and that if we
[2:27:24.360 --> 2:27:27.880]  judge it wrong, he did it, he can be impeached, he won't be impeached, he'll be carried on
[2:27:27.880 --> 2:27:29.280]  our shoulders forever.
[2:27:29.280 --> 2:27:34.960]  He will secure the Trump name in legend and our republic into the future.
[2:27:34.960 --> 2:27:37.240]  And it's the right thing to do.
[2:27:37.240 --> 2:27:43.520]  And so, I asked the president to release full information warfare payloads immediately.
[2:27:43.520 --> 2:27:44.520]  Now is the time.
[2:27:44.520 --> 2:27:49.480]  I mean, I would, I know there's a lot, but I would release the most horrid portion right
[2:27:49.480 --> 2:27:54.720]  up front, and then secondary portions, and then portions, and then of course then others
[2:27:54.720 --> 2:28:01.640]  will run like fetted rats, stumbling off cliffs and will squeal as they jump off headlong
[2:28:01.640 --> 2:28:02.640]  once there.
[2:28:02.640 --> 2:28:03.640]  Aura of invincibility.
[2:28:03.640 --> 2:28:08.200]  See, I don't have the aura of invincibility, I have the aura of destiny, and I'm ready
[2:28:08.200 --> 2:28:09.200]  to be destroyed.
[2:28:09.200 --> 2:28:13.120]  Don't want to be, but I don't think I'm invincible.
[2:28:13.120 --> 2:28:18.680]  I'm only invincible in making the right move, and then letting God sort it out.
[2:28:18.680 --> 2:28:20.480]  Not believing I'll be successful.
[2:28:20.480 --> 2:28:21.480]  That's the difference.
[2:28:21.480 --> 2:28:28.080]  As soon as they realize that their God has failed them, as soon as everything doesn't
[2:28:28.080 --> 2:28:33.440]  continue like it's been a gravy train for their witch, King Hillary, as soon as they
[2:28:33.440 --> 2:28:40.040]  have that final realization, they will be gone, the complete collapse that we'll never
[2:28:40.040 --> 2:28:41.040]  end.
[2:28:41.040 --> 2:28:48.600]  Oh my God, it's going to be delicious as we remove each rotten tooth of the deep state.
[2:28:48.600 --> 2:28:52.920]  Lovingly, with a pair of political pliers.
[2:28:52.920 --> 2:28:59.080]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook
[2:28:59.080 --> 2:29:00.280]  food and boil water.
[2:29:00.280 --> 2:29:04.960]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's
[2:29:04.960 --> 2:29:06.160]  a much better way.
[2:29:06.160 --> 2:29:11.000]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities
[2:29:11.000 --> 2:29:12.640]  of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[2:29:12.640 --> 2:29:16.720]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.

[2:29:25.240 --> 2:29:30.640]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[2:29:30.640 --> 2:29:31.640]  the world.
[2:29:31.640 --> 2:29:34.640]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[2:29:34.640 --> 2:29:40.600]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[2:29:40.600 --> 2:29:44.400]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[2:29:44.400 --> 2:29:45.400]  Was there ever a vote?
[2:29:45.400 --> 2:29:46.960]  Who do we fight for?
[2:29:46.960 --> 2:29:53.520]  The Deep State began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunn, available

[2:32:59.600 --> 2:33:14.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:14.440 --> 2:33:33.780]  Treasure Man says it's the end of time.
[2:33:33.780 --> 2:33:38.680]  I worry about Robert Mueller because he's just an example of everything this country
[2:33:38.680 --> 2:33:39.820]  was designed to stop.
[2:33:39.820 --> 2:33:45.260]  He spent so much time delivering weapons-grade uranium in personal patches and little packages
[2:33:45.260 --> 2:33:49.620]  to Putin that I'm worried about him if he snorted any of it, even just a few little
[2:33:49.620 --> 2:33:55.060]  particles that could give him a brain tumor.
[2:33:55.060 --> 2:34:02.620]  That's why I pray that only God bring justice to Robert Mueller because vengeance belongs
[2:34:02.620 --> 2:34:03.620]  to Jesus.
[2:34:03.620 --> 2:34:07.620]  I'll just partcrank it up.
[2:34:07.620 --> 2:34:13.620]  They long I can catch catfish from dust till dawn.
[2:34:13.620 --> 2:34:16.620]  I know your phone calls are just a moment.
[2:34:16.620 --> 2:34:19.620]  Make our own whiskey and our own smoke too.
[2:34:19.620 --> 2:34:25.620]  Ain't too many things these old boys can't do.
[2:34:25.620 --> 2:34:31.620]  Sure as hell not blue bloods like Mueller or Anderson Cooper, bunch of fakes, keeping
[2:34:31.620 --> 2:34:36.620]  their fake titles, talking about who their robber baron families were.
[2:34:36.620 --> 2:34:39.620]  Yeah well I don't look at who my ancestors were, I look at what I do boy.
[2:34:39.620 --> 2:34:42.620]  But my family eats robber barons.
[2:34:42.620 --> 2:34:48.620]  You can't make us run because these old boys were raised on shotguns.
[2:34:48.620 --> 2:34:49.620]  We say grace.
[2:34:49.620 --> 2:34:50.620]  We say amen.
[2:34:50.620 --> 2:34:56.620]  And yeah into that we don't give a damn.
[2:34:56.620 --> 2:34:58.620]  Alright I'm gonna go back to your calls now.
[2:34:58.620 --> 2:35:00.620]  I'm pretty sure everybody holding patiently.
[2:35:00.620 --> 2:35:05.620]  We've got Steve and Sandy and Charles and so many others.
[2:35:05.620 --> 2:35:07.620]  Steve in Nevada.
[2:35:07.620 --> 2:35:08.620]  Epic times.
[2:35:08.620 --> 2:35:11.620]  Trump says he's got all the dirt on him, all the dirt on the globalist.
[2:35:11.620 --> 2:35:14.620]  I say he releases it or it's a dereliction of duty.
[2:35:14.620 --> 2:35:15.620]  He has no excuse.
[2:35:15.620 --> 2:35:21.620]  He's the executive branch and I think America is ready for the full horror and I think America
[2:35:21.620 --> 2:35:23.620]  is even ready for a depression.
[2:35:23.620 --> 2:35:27.620]  If that's what it takes to not have Hollywood and the globalist destroying our country and
[2:35:27.620 --> 2:35:28.620]  our children.
[2:35:28.620 --> 2:35:30.620]  What do you say Steve?
[2:35:30.620 --> 2:35:34.620]  About damn time.
[2:35:34.620 --> 2:35:35.620]  Absolutely.
[2:35:35.620 --> 2:35:38.620]  Trump sort of got to these people all the long time ago.
[2:35:38.620 --> 2:35:42.620]  Alex it's a privilege and an honor to talk to you and I want to say about your products.
[2:35:42.620 --> 2:35:48.620]  I started taking caveman about a year ago and it changed my life.
[2:35:48.620 --> 2:35:49.620]  Well thank you.
[2:35:49.620 --> 2:35:53.620]  We had a trademark issue so we had to change it to ultimate bone broth but it really is
[2:35:53.620 --> 2:35:56.620]  the strongest most concentrated bone broth out there.
[2:35:56.620 --> 2:36:00.620]  All the studies that will tell people what it did for you.
[2:36:00.620 --> 2:36:05.620]  It got my energy up, it got my stamina up and it lowered my blood pressure to where I
[2:36:05.620 --> 2:36:08.620]  could take a decent truck driving job.
[2:36:08.620 --> 2:36:14.620]  Describe how you took it, how you drank it, how you mixed it and what happened.
[2:36:14.620 --> 2:36:20.620]  You take, well I mixed it up with some other stuff but you have to put it into a blender.
[2:36:20.620 --> 2:36:23.620]  You mix it up for a little bit, add some like fruit in there.
[2:36:23.620 --> 2:36:26.620]  I would always use chia seeds and some lemon.
[2:36:26.620 --> 2:36:30.620]  Drink it first thing in the morning and you are hyper all day long.
[2:36:30.620 --> 2:36:31.620]  Oh absolutely.
[2:36:31.620 --> 2:36:36.620]  I mean this is, it's hard to quantify it but it's twice as strong as the leading brand.
[2:36:36.620 --> 2:36:42.620]  It's absolutely organic chicken bones but they're taken raw.
[2:36:42.620 --> 2:36:43.620]  That's reduced down.
[2:36:43.620 --> 2:36:47.620]  So it's beyond, I mean everybody knows you have the floor or whatever.
[2:36:47.620 --> 2:36:50.620]  You know drink chicken broth, chicken noodle soup and it's been proven to help.
[2:36:50.620 --> 2:36:52.620]  Well this is like hundreds of times stronger.
[2:36:52.620 --> 2:36:57.620]  And then it's got the turmeric in it, it's got a bunch of other things, the bee pollen
[2:36:57.620 --> 2:37:00.620]  and it really is the ultimate formula out there.
[2:37:00.620 --> 2:37:07.620]  And for energy stamina, building muscle, the chondroitin effect is over the top.
[2:37:07.620 --> 2:37:11.620]  It really is an amazing product so thanks for the support.
[2:37:11.620 --> 2:37:17.620]  I will support you any way I know how but Alex I just wanted to say Trump should have done this a long time ago
[2:37:17.620 --> 2:37:23.620]  and I believe just me, eye for an eye, tooth for tooth right about now.
[2:37:23.620 --> 2:37:25.620]  Well I mean what do they have?
[2:37:25.620 --> 2:37:30.620]  Oh my gosh some of his lawyers you know owned a taxi cab place and weren't paying taxes.
[2:37:30.620 --> 2:37:31.620]  Nothing to do with Trump.
[2:37:31.620 --> 2:37:36.620]  And now oh they busted another lawyer and raided them in Chicago today for something separate.
[2:37:36.620 --> 2:37:42.620]  There's no Russia there except for Robert Mueller on the tarmac with the uranium.
[2:37:42.620 --> 2:37:45.620]  It's like the insult to our intelligence.
[2:37:45.620 --> 2:37:47.620]  They're sick of it man.
[2:37:47.620 --> 2:37:51.620]  What ever happened to attorney client privilege?
[2:37:51.620 --> 2:37:52.620]  Well that's a good point.
[2:37:52.620 --> 2:37:56.620]  This is next level to raid Cohen but here's what's happening.
[2:37:56.620 --> 2:37:59.620]  They've got, it's parallel construction.
[2:37:59.620 --> 2:38:03.620]  Corrupt elements of the FBI have total NSA database connection.
[2:38:03.620 --> 2:38:08.620]  They then have algorithm computers that are able to run somebody's finances
[2:38:08.620 --> 2:38:11.620]  and what they own and tell if somebody's breaking the law.
[2:38:11.620 --> 2:38:15.620]  But they don't tell the public that because the public will then start, you know,
[2:38:15.620 --> 2:38:17.620]  who's not paying taxes will start looking out for it.
[2:38:17.620 --> 2:38:21.620]  So it's kind of like they had the code to the German ultra or enigma machine
[2:38:21.620 --> 2:38:24.620]  but throughout World War II they never let Hitler know.
[2:38:24.620 --> 2:38:29.620]  And sometimes they let Germans sink a fleet or win a war or win a battle
[2:38:29.620 --> 2:38:32.620]  so they'd win the overall larger war.
[2:38:32.620 --> 2:38:33.620]  And so it's the same thing.
[2:38:33.620 --> 2:38:37.620]  So all this illegal spying is going on and they've been spying on everybody
[2:38:37.620 --> 2:38:41.620]  and so they can spy on the hundreds of lawyers Trump has.
[2:38:41.620 --> 2:38:45.620]  Find corruption on one of them, raid them, get them,
[2:38:45.620 --> 2:38:50.620]  and then say, oh, tell us Trump did this and you won't serve 10 years in prison.
[2:38:50.620 --> 2:38:54.620]  And they know the average dirty knuckle dragon cowardly lawyer,
[2:38:54.620 --> 2:38:57.620]  same folks sold this country out, will do it.
[2:38:57.620 --> 2:39:00.620]  But the problem is they never have any real evidence that Trump did anything.
[2:39:00.620 --> 2:39:04.620]  So it's just next level.
[2:39:04.620 --> 2:39:08.620]  Is that modus operandi for the FBI lately?
[2:39:08.620 --> 2:39:10.620]  Well, this is how it works.
[2:39:10.620 --> 2:39:13.620]  The FBI started out fighting communists and anarchists
[2:39:13.620 --> 2:39:17.620]  and basically antifa that were blowing up stuff and it was a real organization.
[2:39:17.620 --> 2:39:22.620]  And they came up with a lot of good tracking systems and, you know,
[2:39:22.620 --> 2:39:24.620]  modern policing, modern forensics.
[2:39:24.620 --> 2:39:25.620]  The FBI has done a lot of good.
[2:39:25.620 --> 2:39:28.620]  And that's not some exercise of kissing their ass so they don't come after me.
[2:39:28.620 --> 2:39:30.620]  I'm going after the evil kingpin.
[2:39:30.620 --> 2:39:34.620]  But it hurts us if we just say the whole thing's evil, the whole thing's bad.
[2:39:34.620 --> 2:39:38.620]  There's a place in the Constitution to have federal law enforcement.
[2:39:38.620 --> 2:39:45.620]  The problem is, is that once they interfaced La Cosa Nostra in the 40s and 50s,
[2:39:45.620 --> 2:39:48.620]  they got bought off, they got paid off, they got corrupted,
[2:39:48.620 --> 2:39:52.620]  then they got politically corrupted, then they got blackmailed.
[2:39:52.620 --> 2:39:55.620]  And, you know, let's face it, there are a lot of folks tougher in different
[2:39:55.620 --> 2:39:57.620]  mafias than there are in lawyers.
[2:39:57.620 --> 2:40:03.620]  So it created a society of really corrupt people at the top who then
[2:40:03.620 --> 2:40:06.620]  compartmentalized the FBI to where real FBI agents couldn't do any real work.
[2:40:06.620 --> 2:40:09.620]  We saw that on 9-11 in order to stand down.
[2:40:09.620 --> 2:40:10.620]  I mean, it just goes on from there.
[2:40:10.620 --> 2:40:13.620]  So we do it to service if we just say the whole thing's corrupt
[2:40:13.620 --> 2:40:15.620]  because the average FBI agent knows that's not true.
[2:40:15.620 --> 2:40:19.620]  But if you talk about Mueller and Comey and all these guys,
[2:40:19.620 --> 2:40:23.620]  these are arch criminals who have been involved and cover up forever.
[2:40:23.620 --> 2:40:29.620]  They get special little collections of corrupt people under them,
[2:40:29.620 --> 2:40:33.620]  very weak-minded, sycophantic people like Strach, you know,
[2:40:33.620 --> 2:40:36.620]  who acts like a literal gremlin in Congress,
[2:40:36.620 --> 2:40:39.620]  and they just don't get in trouble so long,
[2:40:39.620 --> 2:40:43.620]  so they think they're invincible, then they actually go mentally ill and crazy.
[2:40:43.620 --> 2:40:47.620]  And so that's the point we've reached now is, imagine you're Mueller,
[2:40:47.620 --> 2:40:50.620]  Mueller, Mueller, Hillary, you're in bed with the Russians, the Chinese,
[2:40:50.620 --> 2:40:52.620]  you sold everybody out, you're on the board of 10 companies,
[2:40:52.620 --> 2:40:54.620]  you're delivering uranium on tarmatch,
[2:40:54.620 --> 2:40:58.620]  you got an investigation going on Trump thinking you beat him saying Russia,
[2:40:58.620 --> 2:41:02.620]  now he's about to be the president and learned you did this, you double down,
[2:41:02.620 --> 2:41:05.620]  you keep the fake Russia investigation going.
[2:41:05.620 --> 2:41:07.620]  And so they're not going to stop.
[2:41:07.620 --> 2:41:11.620]  And so Trump realizes that now is that they're going to have to be dealt with.
[2:41:11.620 --> 2:41:13.620]  And look, look at that mental patient, Hillary.
[2:41:13.620 --> 2:41:15.620]  I mean, she is a demonic mental patient.
[2:41:15.620 --> 2:41:17.620]  They will be defeated.
[2:41:17.620 --> 2:41:21.620]  But some of us just have to be ready to take what happens.
[2:41:21.620 --> 2:41:23.620]  People say, how are you handling her?
[2:41:23.620 --> 2:41:24.620]  Are you depressed?
[2:41:24.620 --> 2:41:26.620]  Do you feel, I've never felt better.
[2:41:26.620 --> 2:41:29.620]  I mean, you know, they could have me in front of a firing squad.
[2:41:29.620 --> 2:41:32.620]  I don't want to die, but if they line me up in the firing squad,
[2:41:32.620 --> 2:41:35.620]  you know, for what I've done, it means I delivered to the end.
[2:41:35.620 --> 2:41:37.620]  I was faithful to the end.
[2:41:37.620 --> 2:41:38.620]  I didn't back down.
[2:41:38.620 --> 2:41:39.620]  But let me tell you something right now.
[2:41:39.620 --> 2:41:41.620]  We're going to beat that old dumb hag, Hillary.
[2:41:41.620 --> 2:41:44.620]  We're going to defeat the Michael Morris of the country.
[2:41:44.620 --> 2:41:46.620]  America wants prosperity.
[2:41:46.620 --> 2:41:47.620]  It wants a future.
[2:41:47.620 --> 2:41:50.620]  We don't want to be subservient to the chai comms, the globalists.
[2:41:50.620 --> 2:41:53.620]  For that alone, the Pentagon's not perfect.
[2:41:53.620 --> 2:41:57.620]  It's got problems, but it's alpha and it's not going to be beta.
[2:41:57.620 --> 2:41:59.620]  And that's why the globalists are done.
[2:41:59.620 --> 2:42:01.620]  They wanted America to collapse and be over with them.
[2:42:01.620 --> 2:42:02.620]  They screwed over.
[2:42:02.620 --> 2:42:03.620]  It's not happening.
[2:42:03.620 --> 2:42:05.620]  And there's a lot of us willing to die to make sure it doesn't.
[2:42:05.620 --> 2:42:08.620]  So get that through your mind, you globalists.
[2:42:08.620 --> 2:42:10.620]  This isn't some revada or some act.
[2:42:10.620 --> 2:42:11.620]  You know this spirit.
[2:42:11.620 --> 2:42:16.620]  And it's the spirit of victory over you that will break you in the end.
[2:42:16.620 --> 2:42:17.620]  You are broken.
[2:42:17.620 --> 2:42:18.620]  You are defeated.
[2:42:18.620 --> 2:42:19.620]  Period.
[2:42:19.620 --> 2:42:20.620]  It's done.
[2:42:20.620 --> 2:42:22.620]  We just have to take our birth right in our hands.
[2:42:22.620 --> 2:42:24.620]  Steve, I just took one call in 10 minutes.
[2:42:24.620 --> 2:42:25.620]  I apologize.
[2:42:25.620 --> 2:42:29.620]  I'm going to try my best when we come back to talk to Charles and Wilde and Matt and
[2:42:29.620 --> 2:42:31.620]  Pastor Sam and mankind and Jefferson and Sandy.
[2:42:31.620 --> 2:42:34.620]  Sandy's up next and Jonathan and DJ and everybody else.
[2:42:34.620 --> 2:42:38.620]  And then I normally have the Hagmonds taken over, but our special live event is behind.
[2:42:38.620 --> 2:42:40.620]  So we'll see when that's going to happen.
[2:42:40.620 --> 2:42:42.620]  It's all coming up today.
[2:42:42.620 --> 2:42:45.620]  News wars.com, info wars.com.

[2:43:00.620 --> 2:43:02.620]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[2:43:02.620 --> 2:43:03.620]  It's a good thing.
[2:43:03.620 --> 2:43:06.620]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[2:43:06.620 --> 2:43:08.620]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[2:43:08.620 --> 2:43:10.620]  I learned what the best was.
[2:43:10.620 --> 2:43:15.620]  Now the Alexa Pure pros their biggest, nicest, stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[2:43:15.620 --> 2:43:16.620]  It's amazing.
[2:43:16.620 --> 2:43:17.620]  That's not all the bad stuff.
[2:43:17.620 --> 2:43:19.620]  It leaves the good stuff in the good minerals.
[2:43:19.620 --> 2:43:25.620]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at my page supply that have developed these filters ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[2:43:25.620 --> 2:43:27.620]  He has a glut of them.
[2:43:27.620 --> 2:43:31.620]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[2:43:31.620 --> 2:43:35.620]  When it's discounted using 200, it's 127.
[2:43:35.620 --> 2:43:39.620]  He's selling them to us at cost and we're making 20 something bucks on.
[2:43:39.620 --> 2:43:41.620]  So they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[2:43:41.620 --> 2:43:44.620]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.

[2:47:19.620 --> 2:47:27.620]  I'm on your phone calls in T-minus 30 seconds, but this story right here just went up on newswars.com by Kit Daniels.
[2:47:27.620 --> 2:47:36.620]  And at least to the local news, the Democrats officially announced a law they want to pass, bloody legal aliens vote statewide.
[2:47:36.620 --> 2:47:38.620]  It's happening, they're passing it everywhere.
[2:47:38.620 --> 2:47:39.620]  Remember they would deny that?
[2:47:39.620 --> 2:47:52.620]  But guess what, they already passed a few years ago that let the Democrats win New Jersey, letting illegals get driver's license, and then now they can use that to vote.
[2:47:52.620 --> 2:47:54.620]  Unbelievable.
[2:47:54.620 --> 2:47:57.620]  I mean, this is incredible.
[2:47:57.620 --> 2:48:02.620]  Okay, we're talking about Trump saying he's taking the gloves off, he's got all the dearly Democrats.
[2:48:02.620 --> 2:48:06.620]  Like what Sandy said, I see in the little comment section, unleash everything.
[2:48:06.620 --> 2:48:17.620]  Yes, because that will then, the full break, like, you know, you're playing pool, you want to, when you're breaking, you want to hit as hard as you can, you want to get those balls all over the place.
[2:48:17.620 --> 2:48:20.620]  You want to go full in right now, that'll cause a chain reaction.
[2:48:20.620 --> 2:48:27.620]  Trump must go on the total offense, he's been lied to about his lawyers, everybody else that, oh no sir, it's going to get wrapped up, it's never going to get wrapped up.
[2:48:27.620 --> 2:48:35.620]  Robert Mueller is a criminal, the Clintons are criminals, you must now give them the full political destruction.
[2:48:35.620 --> 2:48:37.620]  Let's do it, let's go.
[2:48:37.620 --> 2:48:38.620]  Ramming speed.
[2:48:38.620 --> 2:48:42.620]  Sandy in Minnesota, thanks for holding her on the air worldwide.
[2:48:42.620 --> 2:48:46.620]  Hi Alex, two years I've waited to talk to you, what an honor it is.
[2:48:46.620 --> 2:48:48.620]  Honors talk to you, go ahead.
[2:48:48.620 --> 2:48:54.620]  And I'd like to tell you that your products are amazing, they're absolutely game changers in everything that you do.
[2:48:54.620 --> 2:49:05.620]  I have the Silver Bullet, I have the Nathan Iodine, the Secret 12, your new Happys is unbelievable.
[2:49:05.620 --> 2:49:13.620]  The Flora Life, my daughter suffers from IBS really bad and it took it away, totally not a problem anymore.
[2:49:13.620 --> 2:49:22.620]  And then she got a cut, a pretty bad paper cut the other day, long story short, she had it, it was infected, put it on there.
[2:49:22.620 --> 2:49:26.620]  Two days later it was scabbed up and almost healed over.
[2:49:26.620 --> 2:49:34.620]  Oh I got to tell you, I don't mean to digress into the products, but I'm not a big cat person, my mom had cats growing up and dogs, my wife has two cats.
[2:49:34.620 --> 2:49:39.620]  And we got another male cat, it was a kitten, now it's big, it fights with the older tabby, that's 14 pounds.
[2:49:39.620 --> 2:49:48.620]  So the other night there's this huge fight in the living room, I go out there and I try to pull him apart and the bigger one climbs up my arm, pushes off, tears it completely open.
[2:49:48.620 --> 2:49:56.620]  And I've had cat scratches before that took three, four weeks to heal, it's like 70% healed in only like eight, nine days.
[2:49:56.620 --> 2:50:02.620]  And I'm telling you, I put the Silver Wound Gel and the Colloidal Silver all over, the Silver Wound Gel specifically made for that.
[2:50:02.620 --> 2:50:10.620]  And it just, you know how dirty cats are with their back paws, I'm going to go into the tails here, but yes, Silver's critical.
[2:50:10.620 --> 2:50:14.620]  Yes, and I also have the toothpaste and that's really amazing too.
[2:50:14.620 --> 2:50:35.620]  Now as for the Trump thing, he needs to get his ducks in a row, he needs to call a state of the union address, address the people of the United States and say, listen, I've got this, I've got this, I've got this, I've got this, you know, no matter what they do,
[2:50:35.620 --> 2:50:46.620]  if he lets, you know, the more you delay on something, they're going to get into office coming up, they're going to go ahead no matter what he does.
[2:50:46.620 --> 2:50:52.620]  If he doesn't act now, it will be a, I should have done that scenario.
[2:50:52.620 --> 2:51:07.620]  He needs to tell the people, this is what I'm going to do, throw it all on the table and then go from there and just let it loose because no matter what, they're going after him.
[2:51:07.620 --> 2:51:21.620]  Now it's kind of like, the more you stay in the public eye, the more you scream and yell and say, look at me, pay attention to me, that way you're protected.
[2:51:21.620 --> 2:51:27.620]  The American people will stand behind him no matter what he does as far as the ones that are true to him.
[2:51:27.620 --> 2:51:39.620]  As long as he's decisive, and I agree, and it should have been an earlier, but now it's clear, this is his last shot, with all the crimes they've committed, the illegal stuff they've done, if he doesn't move against them on every front,
[2:51:39.620 --> 2:51:49.620]  and I've talked to smart people in government, out of government and others, and they all agree, he needs to have a state of the union, an emergency address in Congress,
[2:51:49.620 --> 2:51:58.620]  where he announces it's all being released right in front of the Democrats to their face, if all these criminals know his strength and let them know that it's on,
[2:51:58.620 --> 2:52:03.620]  because if he just dribbles stuff out, they're going to try to spin it, they're going to obfuscate, they're going to try to tie it up,
[2:52:03.620 --> 2:52:08.620]  he needs to full frontal assault, call these criminals out, which he's getting ready to do.
[2:52:08.620 --> 2:52:17.620]  Well, no matter what he does, if anybody's paying attention, no matter what he does, it's already, they're going after him,
[2:52:17.620 --> 2:52:23.620]  they're going to try to impeach him in any way they possibly can, they're going to do it anyway.
[2:52:23.620 --> 2:52:29.620]  Look what they're putting Roger Stone through in Jerome Corsi, and you, they're going to do it.
[2:52:29.620 --> 2:52:37.620]  So you better fire your cannons now, and stop playing around, and do it now.
[2:52:37.620 --> 2:52:40.620]  Well, ma'am, and I agree with you, and I appreciate your call.
[2:52:40.620 --> 2:52:47.620]  I mean, I want to be clear, Trump told Sessions to take action, he's surrounded by a bunch of double dealing cowards, that's what DC's made up out of,
[2:52:47.620 --> 2:52:54.620]  is a bunch of feather your own nests, never stick your ass out, always, you know, cover all your bases, a bunch of weasels,
[2:52:54.620 --> 2:53:01.620]  and he's finally getting a hardcore cadre of people that are ready to take action.
[2:53:01.620 --> 2:53:09.620]  But this is really the moment of American destiny right now, because there have been a bunch of special interests selling this country out,
[2:53:09.620 --> 2:53:15.620]  every angle you can, and the reason the Pentagon and a lot of other folks are with Trump is they get like,
[2:53:15.620 --> 2:53:23.620]  even if we're hard asses, even if we're evil, which we're not overall, why would we sell it all out just because it's America as a way to conquer it,
[2:53:23.620 --> 2:53:29.620]  instead of when we got the most powerful thing projected into the world and make the world a better place for our kids?
[2:53:29.620 --> 2:53:38.620]  It's the fundamental chicken, I invented a term I can't say on here, I call it the chicken, you know what dimension, the chicken SH-T dimension.
[2:53:38.620 --> 2:53:51.620]  And these people, metaphysically, nothing against the Visigoths, hell I'm related to Visigoths, that stormed and conquered Rome in 410,
[2:53:51.620 --> 2:53:56.620]  instead of trying to administer it or run it, they burned it to the ground.
[2:53:56.620 --> 2:54:03.620]  That was their idea of dominance, was to come in and burn it to the ground and run off with a bunch of women.
[2:54:03.620 --> 2:54:09.620]  And then we had a thousand years of dark age.
[2:54:09.620 --> 2:54:18.620]  So there's this thing where the globalists conquered America so they want to break up the family and give people deadly vaccines and make them mentally retarded,
[2:54:18.620 --> 2:54:22.620]  and I mean, that's satanic, folks, that's satanic.
[2:54:22.620 --> 2:54:26.620]  I mean, if you conquered something, why the hell would you burn it down?
[2:54:26.620 --> 2:54:32.620]  Because it's spiritual, they want to conquer the spirit, they don't just want the infrastructure of America,
[2:54:32.620 --> 2:54:38.620]  they don't just want, they want the soul.
[2:54:38.620 --> 2:54:54.620]  And so I'm going to tell the military, the police, men, women, everybody, do you really want to live in a system where five-year-olds are taught how to suck, talk?
[2:54:54.620 --> 2:54:56.620]  You're like, oh, that's an adult term on air.
[2:54:56.620 --> 2:55:02.620]  I'm not somebody trying to be a shock, jock, using terms like that. That's what they teach five-year-olds.
[2:55:02.620 --> 2:55:10.620]  In standard sex education, they're teaching five-year-olds about anal sex, men having sex with each other, women having sex with each other,
[2:55:10.620 --> 2:55:19.620]  in Macy's Day parades, they got women kissing each other and men kissing each other, running around, shaking their, you know, what's around.
[2:55:19.620 --> 2:55:22.620]  They'll go, oh, what are you against those people? You're damn right I am.
[2:55:22.620 --> 2:55:31.620]  I don't care if you're heterosexual, homosexual, you go around messing with kids, you try to get your mitts in there, you're a psychic vampire pedophile in my book,
[2:55:31.620 --> 2:55:36.620]  and you're my enemy, period. And that's where my line's drawn, keep your damn hands off the kids.
[2:55:36.620 --> 2:55:46.620]  You know, the fictional character Tony Montana was based on Oliver Stone living for about six years in Latin America and a composite of three real guys.
[2:55:46.620 --> 2:55:56.620]  And what's his final line in the sand, even though he's worth a billion dollars and all this power, he goes, I told you, no women, no kids.
[2:55:56.620 --> 2:56:07.620]  Politicians are more than willing to have him fence the corruption for him and have him do it all, but see, at the end of the day, he won't kill women or kids.
[2:56:07.620 --> 2:56:12.620]  They'll kill the communists for free, but for a green card, you'll carve them up real nice.
[2:56:12.620 --> 2:56:17.620]  But that's killing a corrupt man that's been oppressing people. That's killing a bad person.
[2:56:17.620 --> 2:56:26.620]  That's not killing a kid or killing a child's innocence. So is that who you are, world? Which side are you on?
[2:56:26.620 --> 2:56:34.620]  I'm not with the pedophiles. I'm not with people that use pedophiles to compromise other people like Jeffrey Epstein and Robert Mueller.
[2:56:34.620 --> 2:56:46.620]  You got to decide. Hell, the Vatican just got caught running giant child kidnapping rings from Australia, the U.S., and the Pope three weeks ago ordered the investigation ended.
[2:56:46.620 --> 2:56:51.620]  I'm going to go to break. Come back with more of your calls into the next hour. I don't use a commandeer, Doug Hagman's show, but I have to.
[2:56:51.620 --> 2:56:54.620]  There's this big live special thing. Plus, I can take your calls. You can write shotgun with me.
[2:56:54.620 --> 2:56:58.620]  Hagman report. They're coming up. And just a brief plug here.
[2:56:58.620 --> 2:57:04.620]  If you don't finance this, we're gone. And I don't want to go away. But at the end of the day, however, the chips fall, that's what happens.
[2:57:04.620 --> 2:57:07.620]  But I just don't plug enough. So biggest problem's me.
[2:57:07.620 --> 2:57:15.620]  Storewide free shipping, 50% off all the supplements, up to 75% off many products that we're clearing out that are great.
[2:57:15.620 --> 2:57:19.620]  That's still ever an Alexa PurePair water filtration systems. It's all got to end.
[2:57:19.620 --> 2:57:25.620]  We'll keep these mega specials going at the end of the year because I'm selling everything out, but a lot of stuff in the next few days will not be there.
[2:57:25.620 --> 2:57:29.620]  I'm talking about X2. I'm talking about BrainForce. I'm talking about SuperMailVatality.
[2:57:29.620 --> 2:57:35.620]  I'm talking about a bunch of stuff is in its last few weeks, and some of it is not coming back in production.

[3:00:05.620 --> 3:00:19.620]  Music
[3:00:19.620 --> 3:00:34.620]  You know, I made a decision a few weeks ago to go ahead and say on air what they're teaching five-year-old kids in elementary school from Houston, Texas to Lafayette, Louisiana to Los Angeles, California to Buffalo, New York.
[3:00:34.620 --> 3:00:51.620]  I'm sitting here and I won't even show footage that they put on local news because I think it's pornographic to have a man with only glitter on his genitals and he's got little kids hugging him and this is drag queen hour.
[3:00:51.620 --> 3:01:07.620]  So even, I mean I've got points I won't go to but I'll tell some radio and TV stations if you're mad that I talked about they're teaching five-year-olds how to have anal sex then you better get down to your local city council because they're doing it in your local town with little kids.
[3:01:07.620 --> 3:01:14.620]  My show is not shop jock about sex and stuff. I have to cover this because this is what's going on.
[3:01:14.620 --> 3:01:27.620]  They've got people that want access to your children in the schools on TV saying we're going to groom your kids and teach them how to be LGBT.
[3:01:27.620 --> 3:01:37.620]  I don't want some shrub teaching my daughters or my son about heterosexual sex. What the hell is going on here?
[3:01:37.620 --> 3:01:48.620]  So I know I'm uncomfortable talking about this because it makes me get angry. So I know it's upsetting.
[3:01:48.620 --> 3:01:56.620]  But Nambla and everybody else are out of control. If you don't know what Nambla is you better find out because your children are learning about it right now.
[3:01:56.620 --> 3:02:08.620]  Now what should Trump do against the deep state? How should he take action? He's signaled he is. What do you think about that?
[3:02:08.620 --> 3:02:31.620]  You said in the last hour that President Trump is looking for a hardcore cadre of people ready to take action and we're looking at the United States and we want our crooks hung but there is a coalition being formed right now as the president is in Buenos Aires, Argentina for the G20.
[3:02:31.620 --> 3:02:42.620]  He is assembling world leaders of nations that are with him and he's going to confront the ones that are against him. You know Junkers is going to be there.
[3:02:42.620 --> 3:02:53.620]  Drunkers, John Claude, all of those guys are going to be there. So the rumble is beginning starting tomorrow in Buenos Aires this time around.
[3:02:53.620 --> 3:03:05.620]  Also, Jared Kushner is getting a huge award from the Mexican president two days before he leaves office and lets the socialist president, it's been supposedly elected takeover.
[3:03:05.620 --> 3:03:20.620]  This is going to basically make Jared Kushner equivalent of a knight in Mexico and give him the ability to sit at the table with these world leaders without any of these kids jokes that have been chasing him around the world.
[3:03:20.620 --> 3:03:27.620]  The rumble is beginning, the president is working and it's happening in Mexico City and Buenos Aires right now.
[3:03:27.620 --> 3:03:43.620]  And of course you've got the Brazilian Trump Balasaro, I'm not pronouncing his name wrong, Balasaro, I mean he's there, I mean it's happening all over. We're definitely in the fight but I mean tell you the deep states making their move on Trump, he's got to go after him.
[3:03:43.620 --> 3:03:54.620]  Wait, Balasaro, although he is not yet president, is a guest invitee to this 220 as is Trump's Chilean president, Sebastián Piñera.
[3:03:54.620 --> 3:04:00.620]  These are the allies worldwide that Trump is bringing together. This is the hardcore cadre.
[3:04:00.620 --> 3:04:12.620]  And there's even news about international prosecution of international criminals that's come out in the Guardian and the person that's mentioned is Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
[3:04:12.620 --> 3:04:15.620]  I don't think that he's guilty of what the talk is.
[3:04:15.620 --> 3:04:20.620]  Sure, but the executive orders have been signed. Here's the deal, there's a global realignment happening right now.
[3:04:20.620 --> 3:04:25.620]  Nation states realize they still have the power. Why should they give it to globalists that are out to destroy the nation state?
[3:04:25.620 --> 3:04:28.620]  And so there is definitely a global fight going on.
[3:04:28.620 --> 3:04:35.620]  Pastor Sam, thank you. Wild and Jonathan and Jefferson and many others, your calls are straight ahead when we come back on the other side.
[3:04:35.620 --> 3:04:45.620]  Remember, newswars.com, prisonplanet.com, infowars.com. We've been erased from all the big tech giant platforms, not David Duke, not Lewis Farrakhan.
[3:04:45.620 --> 3:04:53.620]  We have, because we're creating real unity. Only you can share those links. Only you can stop them.
[3:04:53.620 --> 3:05:01.620]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it,
[3:05:01.620 --> 3:05:05.620]  that it lowers IQ. It literally dumps the population down.
[3:05:05.620 --> 3:05:12.620]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[3:05:12.620 --> 3:05:18.620]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[3:05:18.620 --> 3:05:24.620]  So we discovered deep earth crystals, a pure nascent iodine and brought UX2 that's been incredible.
[3:05:24.620 --> 3:05:32.620]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[3:05:32.620 --> 3:05:40.620]  But chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C,
[3:05:40.620 --> 3:05:45.620]  it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[3:05:45.620 --> 3:05:49.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[3:05:49.620 --> 3:05:54.620]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[3:06:19.620 --> 3:06:31.620]  We are back live. We've got Doug Hagman set to take over very, very soon.
[3:06:31.620 --> 3:06:35.620]  I had a very interesting act that was telling me about something that was going to be happening today at noon central.
[3:06:35.620 --> 3:06:39.620]  And so I've been standing by with a camera crew there to cover it since I was told it's going to happen.
[3:06:39.620 --> 3:06:44.620]  But I'm going to have to not cover that live here soon because I'm not going to run over what Doug Hagman has to cover here.
[3:06:44.620 --> 3:06:49.620]  But we'll obviously have it for you at infowars.com and newswars.com as soon as that goes live.
[3:06:49.620 --> 3:06:51.620]  Right now, let's go back to your phone calls.
[3:06:51.620 --> 3:06:54.620]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[3:06:54.620 --> 3:06:59.620]  That would be wild in Wisconsin. You're on the air. Thank you.
[3:06:59.620 --> 3:07:11.620]  Hi, Mr. Jones. I have a question. I wanted to get your opinion if it's a coincidence or if I'm over analyzing specifically regarding the presidential meme.
[3:07:11.620 --> 3:07:16.620]  And if it's meme magic or not, the one posted on Drudge Report, you put it on screen.
[3:07:16.620 --> 3:07:17.620]  I'm sure you're familiar with it.
[3:07:17.620 --> 3:07:21.620]  You were talking about the one yesterday that showed the globalist on bars?
[3:07:21.620 --> 3:07:25.620]  Yeah, with all the clowns in the background and then the bars.
[3:07:25.620 --> 3:07:30.620]  Yeah, you're talking about like Hillary and Bill and Comey and all them behind bars.
[3:07:30.620 --> 3:07:31.620]  Yeah, all the orcs there.
[3:07:31.620 --> 3:07:37.620]  Now, ignore those guys, ignore all of them, and focus more on the bars, the prison bars.
[3:07:37.620 --> 3:07:43.620]  They look to be iron. They also use iron for cemeteries to keep in bad spirits.
[3:07:43.620 --> 3:07:51.620]  But if you take the whole picture and flip it upside down, is it me or is it kind of like a magic eye?
[3:07:51.620 --> 3:08:00.620]  If you then relax your eyes and look at the clowns in the background, how many crosses do you count?
[3:08:00.620 --> 3:08:10.620]  Well, I mean, I do see a bunch of crosses there. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21.
[3:08:10.620 --> 3:08:12.620]  I mean, it's like 30 something.
[3:08:12.620 --> 3:08:17.620]  Is that just me or is that a coincidence?
[3:08:17.620 --> 3:08:18.620]  That there's what?
[3:08:18.620 --> 3:08:20.620]  Crosses.
[3:08:20.620 --> 3:08:24.620]  Well, you're going to see crosses anywhere in geometry or anywhere in the world.
[3:08:24.620 --> 3:08:35.620]  I think the overt image is, you know, your treasonous, you try to destroy this country, your globalist, and I'm coming for you.
[3:08:35.620 --> 3:08:39.620]  Yeah, I agree. I agree. I just thought it was, I thought it was clear as the thing.
[3:08:39.620 --> 3:08:41.620]  Trump can't believe that they don't sue for peace.
[3:08:41.620 --> 3:08:48.620]  But when you are a rat bastard like Rosenstein or Hillary Clinton, they never built anything but came into a power structure because you were such a traitor.
[3:08:48.620 --> 3:08:49.620]  We're giving everything.
[3:08:49.620 --> 3:08:52.620]  They are only used to their raw exercise of power.
[3:08:52.620 --> 3:08:56.620]  And so they just can't believe that it's the end of the, I mean, take John Podesta.
[3:08:56.620 --> 3:09:02.620]  He's in the emails going to Alistair Crowley events to drink semen and blood.
[3:09:02.620 --> 3:09:05.620]  Now, who would want to go do that?
[3:09:05.620 --> 3:09:07.620]  Well, these are freaks, man.
[3:09:07.620 --> 3:09:14.620]  And so that's why they created the whole fake pizza gate thing to distract everybody off of to divert us into from the real stuff they're involved in.
[3:09:14.620 --> 3:09:27.620]  I mean, this guy, these are the, these are his brother published in the Washington Post in 2007, his love of video and photos of naked children and displayed pedophilic photos.
[3:09:27.620 --> 3:09:29.620]  That's lesser magic to them.
[3:09:29.620 --> 3:09:33.620]  If they can throw it in your face, that's the real power.
[3:09:33.620 --> 3:09:39.620]  And so this is real stuff out of Podesta's art that he puts out himself, his brother.
[3:09:39.620 --> 3:09:44.620]  So these are sick people, man, who wants pictures of little boys tied up, you know, raped.
[3:09:44.620 --> 3:09:47.620]  But, but that, you understand, it's a spiritual thing.
[3:09:47.620 --> 3:09:53.620]  If you look at Podesta and his brother, they look like snaggle tooth, yellow tooth vampires.
[3:09:53.620 --> 3:09:55.620]  Like their teeth are pointed.
[3:09:55.620 --> 3:09:58.620]  They're all, I mean, these are some sick freaks, man.
[3:09:58.620 --> 3:10:01.620]  And, and so we just allow these ghouls.
[3:10:01.620 --> 3:10:06.620]  They go, oh, be tolerant, be loving, have no opinions so we can roll you.
[3:10:06.620 --> 3:10:09.620]  And so that's what it comes down to while I appreciate your call.
[3:10:09.620 --> 3:10:14.620]  These are monsters and their time is coming to an end.
[3:10:14.620 --> 3:10:16.620]  They thought our time is coming to an end.
[3:10:16.620 --> 3:10:17.620]  No, it's the other way around.
[3:10:17.620 --> 3:10:21.620]  Let's talk to Jefferson in Virginia.
[3:10:21.620 --> 3:10:22.620]  Jefferson, you're on the air.
[3:10:22.620 --> 3:10:23.620]  Welcome.
[3:10:23.620 --> 3:10:25.620]  Alex, it's a pleasure to talk to you.
[3:10:25.620 --> 3:10:28.620]  Welcome on the funding front.
[3:10:28.620 --> 3:10:30.620]  I think I have an idea for you.
[3:10:30.620 --> 3:10:36.620]  It seems to me that just people make fun of you for the atrazine and the gay frog meme.
[3:10:36.620 --> 3:10:40.620]  It should be you that becomes the next Carlos slim of water, water filters.
[3:10:40.620 --> 3:10:45.620]  You should get a government contract to provide the public with water filters.
[3:10:45.620 --> 3:10:47.620]  Well, we certainly need water filters.
[3:10:47.620 --> 3:10:48.620]  A lot of bad stuff in the regular water.
[3:10:48.620 --> 3:10:50.620]  What's your idea?
[3:10:50.620 --> 3:10:56.620]  Well, I think you can, you can capitalize on the notion that you're the champion for,
[3:10:56.620 --> 3:10:57.620]  for clean water for America.
[3:10:57.620 --> 3:11:02.620]  Nobody can be against clean water and there's got to be health and human services is run
[3:11:02.620 --> 3:11:04.620]  by a man named Alex Azar.
[3:11:04.620 --> 3:11:09.620]  So the elective pure is perfect to get him on board to put an elective pure in everybody's
[3:11:09.620 --> 3:11:15.620]  house at government expense and you get a licensing fee and you, you cover your costs
[3:11:15.620 --> 3:11:17.620]  and, and, and not great.
[3:11:17.620 --> 3:11:21.620]  We should have a nationwide campaign for people to filter their water with systems that actually
[3:11:21.620 --> 3:11:22.620]  filter it.
[3:11:22.620 --> 3:11:24.620]  Don't just take out the bad taste, but actually cut out all the garbage.
[3:11:24.620 --> 3:11:26.620]  That's a really good idea.
[3:11:26.620 --> 3:11:29.620]  It's like a national initiative for everybody to clean their water.
[3:11:29.620 --> 3:11:30.620]  Yeah.
[3:11:30.620 --> 3:11:33.620]  But I mean, if Carlos Slim can get rich, given Obama phones to people, you should be able
[3:11:33.620 --> 3:11:34.620]  to get rich.
[3:11:34.620 --> 3:11:38.620]  I never got a government contract and I don't, I don't know how that works, but I don't
[3:11:38.620 --> 3:11:39.620]  think he could mandate.
[3:11:39.620 --> 3:11:43.620]  He mandated really cheap cell phones and the government got a database and got to get Democrats
[3:11:43.620 --> 3:11:44.620]  to vote.
[3:11:44.620 --> 3:11:48.620]  And then there was a payoff to Carlos Slim of $3 billion, well, $5 billion total, $3
[3:11:48.620 --> 3:11:50.620]  billion profit that he was able to buy the New York Times with.
[3:11:50.620 --> 3:11:52.620]  But that's a great point.
[3:11:52.620 --> 3:11:54.620]  Jefferson, anything else in your mind?
[3:11:54.620 --> 3:11:57.620]  The David Knight show this morning appeared to be jammed.
[3:11:57.620 --> 3:11:58.620]  I'm not sure what happened.
[3:11:58.620 --> 3:12:01.620]  He said he was going to do something on Google yesterday at the end of his show.
[3:12:01.620 --> 3:12:03.620]  And then this morning's show was not a live broadcast.
[3:12:03.620 --> 3:12:07.620]  Yeah, no, we're a small operation and David's hosting the show tomorrow.
[3:12:07.620 --> 3:12:08.620]  He took off today.
[3:12:08.620 --> 3:12:10.620]  So the streams didn't go out.
[3:12:10.620 --> 3:12:11.620]  Show didn't go out.
[3:12:11.620 --> 3:12:13.620]  So Death Star level failure.
[3:12:13.620 --> 3:12:16.620]  And that's the kind of thing can, you know, really cripple you.
[3:12:16.620 --> 3:12:20.620]  And that's why we need to get more crew hired and more people because the election really
[3:12:20.620 --> 3:12:25.620]  exhausted us with the crew we have to be able to even be on air.
[3:12:25.620 --> 3:12:30.620]  So I've always explained to the crew, just because you see us on here doesn't mean you're
[3:12:30.620 --> 3:12:31.620]  on air.
[3:12:31.620 --> 3:12:32.620]  It means like a car.
[3:12:32.620 --> 3:12:34.620]  A car needs windshields to look out of.
[3:12:34.620 --> 3:12:40.620]  And so that's what I'm working on behind the scenes is quantifying and looking at what
[3:12:40.620 --> 3:12:43.620]  we do and making sure it's going out.
[3:12:43.620 --> 3:12:48.620]  So that was not a conspiracy against David Knight or M4 Wars.
[3:12:48.620 --> 3:12:50.620]  That was our fault.
[3:12:50.620 --> 3:12:51.620]  We apologize.
[3:12:51.620 --> 3:12:53.620]  The affiliates will work on that as hard as we can.
[3:12:53.620 --> 3:12:56.620]  It's one reason over a decade ago, I stopped doing rebroadcast.
[3:12:56.620 --> 3:13:01.620]  I went actually six days a week live when I was with another network.
[3:13:01.620 --> 3:13:02.620]  Now I run my own shows.
[3:13:02.620 --> 3:13:07.620]  It's not as bad because I was routinely not on about a rebroadcast.
[3:13:07.620 --> 3:13:09.620]  And so it's kind of an out of sight out of mind.
[3:13:09.620 --> 3:13:11.620]  There's a discipline of being live.
[3:13:11.620 --> 3:13:14.620]  Being live makes you get it right.
[3:13:14.620 --> 3:13:17.620]  And the people involved in live tend to get it right.
[3:13:17.620 --> 3:13:25.620]  But as soon as you go to tape or as soon as you have an email that is automated or whatever,
[3:13:25.620 --> 3:13:29.620]  it's like getting rid of, you know, you're getting rid of regular arithmetic.
[3:13:29.620 --> 3:13:32.620]  Now no one knows how to do arithmetic without a calculator.
[3:13:32.620 --> 3:13:35.620]  And it's the same thing about technology is great, but it takes the humanity out of it.
[3:13:35.620 --> 3:13:37.620]  Jefferson, I appreciate your call.
[3:13:37.620 --> 3:13:39.620]  Yeah, thanks for reminding me of that.
[3:13:39.620 --> 3:13:41.620]  That's another wonderful thing I have to deal with here.
[3:13:41.620 --> 3:13:48.620]  But yeah, just because the main guy's off doesn't mean the show's off.
[3:13:48.620 --> 3:13:54.620]  And that's and David does a great show.
[3:13:54.620 --> 3:14:04.620]  It's just that things have a way of extincting themselves if people don't put a focus onto it at the technical level.
[3:14:04.620 --> 3:14:06.620]  And that's where I've got to step up.
[3:14:06.620 --> 3:14:09.620]  I'm reviewing everything now at every level of enforce.
[3:14:09.620 --> 3:14:12.620]  I personally listen to the satellites every day.
[3:14:12.620 --> 3:14:14.620]  I personally listen to the audio feeds, video feeds.
[3:14:14.620 --> 3:14:15.620]  I test the emails.
[3:14:15.620 --> 3:14:17.620]  I got up at 5 a.m. now.
[3:14:17.620 --> 3:14:23.620]  I got to work at 545 and I just sit there in a terminal and I go through every single level because it's my job to do it.
[3:14:23.620 --> 3:14:24.620]  And dammit, I'll do it.
[3:14:24.620 --> 3:14:26.620]  And I did catch that David wasn't on there today.
[3:14:26.620 --> 3:14:28.620]  So that's how that works.
[3:14:28.620 --> 3:14:30.620]  So thank you for letting us know about that.
[3:14:30.620 --> 3:14:32.620]  I really appreciate it.
[3:14:32.620 --> 3:14:35.620]  You know, I do know what is working around here.
[3:14:35.620 --> 3:14:37.620]  And that's infowarfstore.com.
[3:14:37.620 --> 3:14:41.620]  I can go out and find the best selling supplements and then make them better.
[3:14:41.620 --> 3:14:46.620]  Private label them, have them top rated, knowing we're a target to be tested and everything else.
[3:14:46.620 --> 3:14:47.620]  We have the best.
[3:14:47.620 --> 3:14:49.620]  And you can get ultimate bone broth.
[3:14:49.620 --> 3:14:50.620]  It was called caveman.
[3:14:50.620 --> 3:14:51.620]  It was a trademark issue.
[3:14:51.620 --> 3:14:53.620]  Ultimate bone broth is even stronger than it was before.
[3:14:53.620 --> 3:15:00.620]  Better formula, turmeric, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, and of course the concentrated bone broth.
[3:15:00.620 --> 3:15:01.620]  It's amazing.
[3:15:01.620 --> 3:15:09.620]  infowarfstore.com, all the supplements are 50% off, the storeable food is 50% off, the water filtration system is 49% off.
[3:15:09.620 --> 3:15:11.620]  You cannot beat these deals.
[3:15:11.620 --> 3:15:13.620]  Double patriot points out of five patriot points.
[3:15:13.620 --> 3:15:17.620]  You get 10 patriot points on every dollar towards your next purchase and for shipping store-wide.
[3:15:17.620 --> 3:15:22.620]  So, a triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine, triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[3:15:22.620 --> 3:15:24.620]  Doug Hagman is coming up.
[3:15:24.620 --> 3:15:25.620]  Sorry, I can't get the rest of your calls.
[3:15:25.620 --> 3:15:26.620]  I appreciate you holding.
[3:15:26.620 --> 3:15:31.620]  And the war room is coming up today, three o'clock central.
[3:15:31.620 --> 3:15:35.620]  Standard time, that's in about 45 minutes with Owen Shroyer, Roger Stone and more.
[3:15:35.620 --> 3:15:40.620]  I want to thank all the TV and radio affiliates and everybody else who makes it all possible.
[3:15:40.620 --> 3:15:41.620]  Big stuff is coming.
[3:15:41.620 --> 3:15:43.620]  Big times are here.
[3:15:43.620 --> 3:15:48.620]  Crazy times are here, so let's stay focused because the future destiny of humanity is being decided right now.
[3:15:53.620 --> 3:15:54.620]  Hear that?
[3:15:54.620 --> 3:15:59.620]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[3:15:59.620 --> 3:16:02.620]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[3:16:02.620 --> 3:16:06.620]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[3:16:06.620 --> 3:16:13.620]  Go to faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[3:16:13.620 --> 3:16:18.620]  Security is a mindset and fake TV should be part of your security solution.
[3:16:18.620 --> 3:16:20.620]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[3:16:20.620 --> 3:16:22.620]  FakeTV.com
[3:16:22.620 --> 3:16:24.620]  Fully Cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[3:16:24.620 --> 3:16:27.620]  I'm talking thick meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[3:16:27.620 --> 3:16:29.620]  Savory and delicious.
[3:16:29.620 --> 3:16:32.620]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[3:16:32.620 --> 3:16:33.620]  Awesome.

[3:16:37.620 --> 3:16:38.620]  Bacon.

[3:16:42.620 --> 3:16:43.620]  Or warm and served.
[3:16:43.620 --> 3:16:45.620]  Life-saving, ready to eat bacon.
[3:16:45.620 --> 3:16:47.620]  10-year shelf life bacon.

[3:16:52.620 --> 3:16:54.620]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:16:54.620 --> 3:16:58.620]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:16:58.620 --> 3:16:59.620]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:16:59.620 --> 3:17:02.620]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:17:02.620 --> 3:17:08.620]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[3:17:08.620 --> 3:17:09.620]  I can help you too.
[3:17:09.620 --> 3:17:12.620]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[3:17:12.620 --> 3:17:14.620]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[3:17:14.620 --> 3:17:19.620]  Call 834 no tax, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[3:17:19.620 --> 3:17:45.620]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[3:17:45.620 --> 3:17:50.620]  That's 866-295-5305, hpextract.com.
[3:17:50.620 --> 3:18:16.620]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:18:16.620 --> 3:18:23.620]  That's 866-295-5305, hpextract.com.
[3:18:23.620 --> 3:18:32.620]  That's 866-295-5305, hpextract.com.

[3:18:41.620 --> 3:18:53.620]  That's 866-295-5305, hpextract.com.
[3:18:53.620 --> 3:18:59.620]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[3:18:59.620 --> 3:19:05.620]  Obviously water filtration is a great thing, it's a good thing, and I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[3:19:05.620 --> 3:19:09.620]  And over the years I learned a lot about water filtration, I learned what the best was.
[3:19:09.620 --> 3:19:14.620]  Now the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[3:19:14.620 --> 3:19:15.620]  It's amazing.
[3:19:15.620 --> 3:19:17.620]  It cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[3:19:17.620 --> 3:19:24.620]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at my Patreon supply that have developed these filters ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[3:19:24.620 --> 3:19:26.620]  He has a glut of them.
[3:19:26.620 --> 3:19:29.620]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[3:19:29.620 --> 3:19:31.620]  When it's discounted, it's usually $200.
[3:19:31.620 --> 3:19:34.620]  It's $127.
[3:19:34.620 --> 3:19:38.620]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making $20-something bucks on them.
[3:19:38.620 --> 3:19:40.620]  So they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[3:19:40.620 --> 3:19:43.620]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[3:19:43.620 --> 3:19:44.620]  It's amazing.
[3:19:44.620 --> 3:20:13.620]  Alexa Pure Pro at infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com or call AAA-253-3139.
[3:20:13.620 --> 3:20:18.620]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:20:18.620 --> 3:20:24.620]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show with Doug Hagman.
[3:20:24.620 --> 3:20:29.620]  Hello, and welcome to this fourth hour edition of Infowars.
[3:20:29.620 --> 3:20:33.620]  Guest hosted by myself, Joe Hagman, and my father, Doug Hagman.
[3:20:33.620 --> 3:20:35.620]  We are Together the Hagman Report.
[3:20:35.620 --> 3:20:39.620]  Go to our website, hagmanreport.com, also Hagman Report Live.
[3:20:39.620 --> 3:20:44.620]  There you can get all our shows and information, and we do appreciate everybody who listens.
[3:20:44.620 --> 3:20:47.620]  Now, we got a lot to get into in this fourth hour.
[3:20:47.620 --> 3:20:54.620]  You have the caravan news, the invasion, the migrant mob continuing to attempt to assault the southern border.
[3:20:54.620 --> 3:21:06.620]  As more caravans are forming south of Mexico's border, as I've heard today, as many as 10,000 in three separate caravans are starting their trek up north.
[3:21:06.620 --> 3:21:15.620]  Not to mention the inside reports, not the news media reports, the inside reports that there are at least eight to 10,000 men in these camps in Tijuana.
[3:21:15.620 --> 3:21:24.620]  And that's one thing I want to talk about and where I want to start today, because the mainstream media has done everything in their power in this psychological warfare against our minds,
[3:21:24.620 --> 3:21:27.620]  against our people and the public perception.
[3:21:27.620 --> 3:21:37.620]  They're trying to change into, this is women and children, this is people just seeking asylum, seeking to flee religious persecution and other economic oppressions,
[3:21:37.620 --> 3:21:39.620]  looking for a better life.
[3:21:39.620 --> 3:21:44.620]  And that narrative has fallen apart over the last few weeks by the mainstream media's own doing.
[3:21:44.620 --> 3:21:52.620]  MSNBC ran a piece just a few days ago showing that there were not many women and children, not many families, mostly military age men.
[3:21:52.620 --> 3:21:59.620]  But I read a report from inside of the camp, one of the YouTube journalists yesterday did a report from inside the camp,
[3:21:59.620 --> 3:22:06.620]  showing that there were up to 8,000 military aged men, aged 20 to 35, inside the caravan.
[3:22:06.620 --> 3:22:09.620]  And there were very few women and children.
[3:22:09.620 --> 3:22:18.620]  They were very scarce in that camp, excuse me, which tells me that the talk about the invasion was not just talk.
[3:22:18.620 --> 3:22:23.620]  It was not just a talking point for the Republican Party, for Trump to score political points.
[3:22:23.620 --> 3:22:31.620]  It was an accurate identification of what we see, this migrant mob, illegal immigrants invading our southern border.
[3:22:31.620 --> 3:22:34.620]  And as Trump said, he's not going to let this happen.
[3:22:34.620 --> 3:22:35.620]  We see the military down there.
[3:22:35.620 --> 3:22:41.620]  We see the National Guard, Homeland Security, Border Patrol, and they are not going to back down.
[3:22:41.620 --> 3:22:43.620]  And it is getting ugly.
[3:22:43.620 --> 3:22:49.620]  Now, we saw yesterday that the information in the news came out that during Obama's presidency,
[3:22:49.620 --> 3:22:52.620]  tear gas was used at least, if not more than once a month.
[3:22:52.620 --> 3:22:54.620]  And the figures were put out there.
[3:22:54.620 --> 3:22:59.620]  But on shows like The View and other mainstream media, The View talked about it.
[3:22:59.620 --> 3:23:00.620]  They did not care.
[3:23:00.620 --> 3:23:03.620]  They did not care what Obama did during his presidency.
[3:23:03.620 --> 3:23:07.620]  Sort of like Hillary Clinton didn't care when she said, what difference does it make?
[3:23:07.620 --> 3:23:12.620]  They did not care on their coverage of The View as they said, I don't care what Obama did during his presidency.
[3:23:12.620 --> 3:23:16.620]  This is about President Trump, but it's only going to get worse.
[3:23:16.620 --> 3:23:24.620]  And President Trump promises he will shut down the border before he will let this get into, turn into a more of a humanitarian crisis.
[3:23:24.620 --> 3:23:29.620]  We see migrants are already returning home, the mayor of Tijuana on the side of Trump.
[3:23:29.620 --> 3:23:32.620]  And it is just a mess down there.
[3:23:32.620 --> 3:23:38.620]  At least though, for Trump, he has stuck to his guns and the military have stuck to their guns,
[3:23:38.620 --> 3:23:42.620]  not allowing this invasion to circle into the United States.
[3:23:42.620 --> 3:23:44.620]  And hopefully it stays that way.
[3:23:44.620 --> 3:23:47.620]  But there's a lot about the caravan that is not being reported.
[3:23:47.620 --> 3:23:53.620]  The diseases, the infectious diseases that people are bringing into this country from the caravan.
[3:23:53.620 --> 3:24:00.620]  The criminals, there have been arrests made of not only men from Bangladesh, but cartel members,
[3:24:00.620 --> 3:24:02.620]  people who have been reported in the past.
[3:24:02.620 --> 3:24:08.620]  And there are up to 500 criminals, according to DHS, that are in this group.
[3:24:08.620 --> 3:24:11.620]  So of course, we cannot let these people invade our country.
[3:24:11.620 --> 3:24:13.620]  We need to set a precedent.
[3:24:13.620 --> 3:24:21.620]  As we see what's happening in Germany, as they invited over a million immigrants into their country under Angela Merkel's globalist platform.
[3:24:21.620 --> 3:24:22.620]  And what do we see?
[3:24:22.620 --> 3:24:24.620]  Now they have started a program.
[3:24:24.620 --> 3:24:27.620]  And I don't know how many people saw this on RT yesterday.
[3:24:27.620 --> 3:24:35.620]  We posted this on Hagman Report to send you back to your homeland and pay your rent for a year if you choose to go back.
[3:24:35.620 --> 3:24:40.620]  Germany in a program realizing, or at least coming to their senses somewhat,
[3:24:40.620 --> 3:24:44.620]  that they have brought too many immigrants or migrants into their country.
[3:24:44.620 --> 3:24:47.620]  And now it is putting such a tax on their system.
[3:24:47.620 --> 3:24:48.620]  They can't sustain it.
[3:24:48.620 --> 3:24:51.620]  So they put these programs in place to send them back.
[3:24:51.620 --> 3:24:56.620]  And what do they offer for incentives if these people decide to go back?
[3:24:56.620 --> 3:25:03.620]  Germany has launched a campaign to return you to your homeland and pay your rent for one year,
[3:25:03.620 --> 3:25:07.620]  which is very insulting, apparently, to the migrants and to some of the local population there.
[3:25:07.620 --> 3:25:09.620]  But that's besides the point.
[3:25:09.620 --> 3:25:12.620]  This is an issue that's not going away anytime soon.
[3:25:12.620 --> 3:25:15.620]  And the media has not been covering it.
[3:25:15.620 --> 3:25:18.620]  Jorge Ramos from Univision yesterday said,
[3:25:18.620 --> 3:25:26.620]  it is the United States' moral obligation, moral duty to absorb these refugees, these migrants.
[3:25:26.620 --> 3:25:28.620]  And it is just ridiculous.
[3:25:28.620 --> 3:25:34.620]  As Alex Jones has said, as the organization's name says itself, this is an information war.
[3:25:34.620 --> 3:25:39.620]  And this is a battle of perception, the most important part of the information war.
[3:25:39.620 --> 3:25:45.620]  And where truth was once considered universal, now it is based on your political ideology.
[3:25:45.620 --> 3:25:50.620]  And we are in trouble. And coming back after we get done with this segment,
[3:25:50.620 --> 3:25:55.620]  I want to get into the next segment, the interrelationship between the CIA and the mainstream media,
[3:25:55.620 --> 3:26:01.620]  both historically and in present day, because the influences of our government agencies
[3:26:01.620 --> 3:26:04.620]  on the mainstream media, on the Hollywood entertainment industry,
[3:26:04.620 --> 3:26:10.620]  is a lot of times overlooked, yet so pivotal and important in this information war.
[3:26:10.620 --> 3:26:15.620]  And we're going to go over the CIA and how they have had relationships with reporters
[3:26:15.620 --> 3:26:19.620]  from every major news service going back 40 plus years.
[3:26:19.620 --> 3:26:21.620]  And why is this relevant today?
[3:26:21.620 --> 3:26:26.620]  Well, it is so important when we see that, again, this is a battle of perception.
[3:26:26.620 --> 3:26:32.620]  And we have the split among our population with so many of the population believing
[3:26:32.620 --> 3:26:39.620]  in the mainstream media's lies and propaganda, social justice, politically correct ideology,
[3:26:39.620 --> 3:26:45.620]  that is destroying the brains and minds of people in America and across the world.
[3:26:45.620 --> 3:26:48.620]  Joe, come on in.
[3:26:48.620 --> 3:26:52.620]  Yeah, before you move on from the caravan news, I just want to mention this.
[3:26:52.620 --> 3:26:59.620]  People have to know there are 786,000 pending immigration cases as of today.
[3:26:59.620 --> 3:27:05.620]  There are 160,000 asylum requests right now.
[3:27:05.620 --> 3:27:14.620]  Consider 10 years ago, 2008, at the start of the fundamental United States, 42,000 asylum requests.
[3:27:14.620 --> 3:27:19.620]  And only 9% to 10%, roughly 9% of asylum requests are actually granted.
[3:27:19.620 --> 3:27:22.620]  So this whole thing about asylum is a red herring.
[3:27:22.620 --> 3:27:23.620]  I just want people to know that.
[3:27:23.620 --> 3:27:32.620]  Just so people have the facts, when you discuss things with your obtuse uncle Ed at the table
[3:27:32.620 --> 3:27:35.620]  at Christmas, understand what the facts are.
[3:27:35.620 --> 3:27:36.620]  So continue.
[3:27:36.620 --> 3:27:38.620]  That was a great.
[3:27:38.620 --> 3:27:41.620]  Yeah, and we got a lot more caravan news.
[3:27:41.620 --> 3:27:48.620]  Before we get into the CIA and the relationship between the CIA and the news media mainstream news media and their narrative,
[3:27:48.620 --> 3:27:57.620]  I want to make sure that we do cover what the report that I read yesterday from people on the ground inside the Tijuana facilities
[3:27:57.620 --> 3:28:03.620]  that they are housing these migrants in Tijuana, even the mayor Tijuana putting a hat on make Tijuana great again.
[3:28:03.620 --> 3:28:04.620]  I thought that was awesome.
[3:28:04.620 --> 3:28:11.620]  But we see that they, for 7 to 10 Mexicans, people who live in Tijuana are very upset with the caravan.
[3:28:11.620 --> 3:28:13.620]  They want them out of their city.
[3:28:13.620 --> 3:28:19.620]  They are putting a strain on the resources of a already poor nation and a very impoverished people.
[3:28:19.620 --> 3:28:24.620]  And they don't expect in Tijuana, they're not expecting special rights, special privileges.
[3:28:24.620 --> 3:28:33.620]  And they see that these caravaners are demanding, expecting to be given housing and healthcare and jobs and money by going to the U.S.
[3:28:33.620 --> 3:28:38.620]  But what gives them more of a right than any other immigrant trying to come here legally, going through the system properly,
[3:28:38.620 --> 3:28:40.620]  spending the money, taking the time to do it right.
[3:28:40.620 --> 3:28:42.620]  It is a disservice to them.
[3:28:42.620 --> 3:28:46.620]  It is a disservice to so many other Americans who are in need, veterans, etc.
[3:28:46.620 --> 3:28:48.620]  And we will talk more about this on the other side.
[3:28:48.620 --> 3:28:52.620]  You're listening to Infowars Hour 4 hosted by Doug and Joe Hagman.
[3:28:52.620 --> 3:28:56.620]  Dane and my neck back and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[3:28:56.620 --> 3:28:59.620]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[3:28:59.620 --> 3:29:01.620]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.

[3:30:09.620 --> 3:30:11.620]  And it's happening now at infowarsstore.com.
[3:30:11.620 --> 3:30:16.620]  The biggest sales ever as we attempt to sell all the great inventory so that we can hopefully be capitalized
[3:30:16.620 --> 3:30:19.620]  to fund ourselves at least a few months into next year.
[3:30:19.620 --> 3:30:20.620]  I don't have to tell you.
[3:30:20.620 --> 3:30:22.620]  We've been under total siege and harassment and attacks.
[3:30:22.620 --> 3:30:24.620]  It would take an hour to go over to some of it.
[3:30:24.620 --> 3:30:29.620]  So right now, at infowarsstore.com, there is the revolution of products that are excellent
[3:30:29.620 --> 3:30:35.620]  and the revolution of funding InfoWars that is now in the absolute thick of the battle,
[3:30:35.620 --> 3:30:39.620]  fighting for the human spirit and human destiny for my children and your children
[3:30:39.620 --> 3:30:41.620]  and all of our shared futures together.
[3:30:41.620 --> 3:30:45.620]  InfoWars will talk about the forbidden taboo subjects.
[3:30:45.620 --> 3:30:49.620]  We will stand up for human life and human destiny, and we will fight until the end.
[3:30:49.620 --> 3:30:51.620]  With your help, humanity has a chance.
[3:30:51.620 --> 3:30:53.620]  Again, thank you all for your support.
[3:30:53.620 --> 3:30:56.620]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[3:30:56.620 --> 3:30:58.620]  We're really, really proud of it.

[3:31:50.620 --> 3:31:53.620]  Get yours today at infowarslife.com.
[3:31:53.620 --> 3:31:56.620]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen
[3:31:56.620 --> 3:32:01.620]  and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it,
[3:32:01.620 --> 3:32:05.620]  that it lowers IQ, it literally dumbs the population down.
[3:32:05.620 --> 3:32:09.620]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodide in the world,
[3:32:09.620 --> 3:32:12.620]  we've gone through two permutations.
[3:32:12.620 --> 3:32:16.620]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source
[3:32:16.620 --> 3:32:18.620]  and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[3:32:18.620 --> 3:32:22.620]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodide
[3:32:22.620 --> 3:32:24.620]  and brought UX2 that's been incredible.
[3:32:24.620 --> 3:32:27.620]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that,
[3:32:27.620 --> 3:32:32.620]  we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodide.
[3:32:32.620 --> 3:32:35.620]  But chemists, scientists and others showed us the research
[3:32:35.620 --> 3:32:40.620]  that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C,
[3:32:40.620 --> 3:32:46.620]  it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[3:32:46.620 --> 3:32:48.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it,
[3:32:48.620 --> 3:32:50.620]  it's an incredible discovery.
[3:32:50.620 --> 3:33:04.620]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[3:33:20.620 --> 3:33:26.620]  Alex Jones with Doug Hagman.
[3:33:26.620 --> 3:33:30.620]  Doug and Joe Hagman here, guest hosting the fourth hour of Infowars
[3:33:30.620 --> 3:33:33.620]  on this Thursday, November 28, 2018.
[3:33:33.620 --> 3:33:36.620]  We're going to get back to news on the caravan from the real numbers
[3:33:36.620 --> 3:33:41.620]  of illegal immigrants in Tijuana attempting to cross the border
[3:33:41.620 --> 3:33:45.620]  as well as the numbers of the health crisis and what's going on there.

[3:35:07.620 --> 3:35:09.620]  All right, back to the caravan.
[3:35:09.620 --> 3:35:13.620]  Hey, let me just chime in on here. Look, folks, Christmas is coming.
[3:35:13.620 --> 3:35:18.620]  If you do exchange gifts on Christmas, shop at Infowars store
[3:35:18.620 --> 3:35:19.620]  because I'm going to tell you something.
[3:35:19.620 --> 3:35:21.620]  We are in the fight of our lives.
[3:35:21.620 --> 3:35:26.620]  And I know people have, you know, they say, oh, you're just about money.
[3:35:26.620 --> 3:35:30.620]  No, you know what? This operation needs to be funded.
[3:35:30.620 --> 3:35:31.620]  And I got to tell you something.
[3:35:31.620 --> 3:35:35.620]  Alex Jones, Infowars, everyone there, they're out in front and center.
[3:35:35.620 --> 3:35:40.620]  And if you just think about this, what are you going to do when you go to tune into Infowars?
[3:35:40.620 --> 3:35:42.620]  And it's not there. All right.
[3:35:42.620 --> 3:35:47.620]  The reason I am so that the products, absolutely great products,
[3:35:47.620 --> 3:35:50.620]  but also think about the fact that you've got skin in this game
[3:35:50.620 --> 3:35:53.620]  and you are helping to fight the fight.
[3:35:53.620 --> 3:35:55.620]  And that's what's really important.
[3:35:55.620 --> 3:35:58.620]  I didn't mean to interject, but I've just got to feel passionately about this.
[3:35:58.620 --> 3:35:59.620]  That's important.
[3:35:59.620 --> 3:36:01.620]  Yeah, you know, and look, look at us.
[3:36:01.620 --> 3:36:05.620]  Okay. As the HagwinReport.com, I just, you know what?
[3:36:05.620 --> 3:36:08.620]  I just want to toss this in here conversationally.
[3:36:08.620 --> 3:36:11.620]  We were talking about this illegal invasion.
[3:36:11.620 --> 3:36:12.620]  All right.
[3:36:12.620 --> 3:36:14.620]  We had folks, we had Reagan-Babon.
[3:36:14.620 --> 3:36:15.620]  All right.
[3:36:15.620 --> 3:36:16.620]  Now, if you don't know who that is.
[3:36:16.620 --> 3:36:18.620]  Yeah, Reagan-R3, Reagan-Babon.
[3:36:18.620 --> 3:36:19.620]  Okay. All right.
[3:36:19.620 --> 3:36:25.620]  So, and it's very interesting because we've got, when we've got a utility,
[3:36:25.620 --> 3:36:30.620]  it's a proprietary utility that's that tracks kind of certain things.
[3:36:30.620 --> 3:36:34.620]  There's certain things on Twitter and I'll just leave it at that.
[3:36:34.620 --> 3:36:38.620]  We tweeted out something that Megan Barth, Reagan-Babe, we had a,
[3:36:38.620 --> 3:36:41.620]  I think we put together like a two minute segment.
[3:36:41.620 --> 3:36:44.620]  And the bottom line is this, okay?
[3:36:44.620 --> 3:36:46.620]  It got no traction.
[3:36:46.620 --> 3:36:47.620]  It didn't go anywhere.
[3:36:47.620 --> 3:36:50.620]  Well, when you look at the back end from the utility, we can see,
[3:36:50.620 --> 3:36:51.620]  guess what?
[3:36:51.620 --> 3:36:53.620]  Well, I mean, we too are being shadow banned.
[3:36:53.620 --> 3:36:56.620]  You might say, well, tell me something I didn't know.
[3:36:56.620 --> 3:37:01.620]  The fact of the matter is, is that we, look, it takes money to fight this battle,
[3:37:01.620 --> 3:37:04.620]  circling back to the products of the store.
[3:37:04.620 --> 3:37:12.620]  When people are being shut out of, when people have their soap box removed to stand upon
[3:37:12.620 --> 3:37:15.620]  or they're public square, when that is taken away from people,
[3:37:15.620 --> 3:37:18.620]  it becomes a very dangerous situation.
[3:37:18.620 --> 3:37:25.620]  So, I just ask everyone, share everything and also support the fight.
[3:37:25.620 --> 3:37:26.620]  Go ahead, Joe.
[3:37:26.620 --> 3:37:27.620]  Sorry.
[3:37:27.620 --> 3:37:32.620]  Oh, did you, go ahead.
[3:37:32.620 --> 3:37:33.620]  Yeah, no.
[3:37:33.620 --> 3:37:37.620]  And you have to, because let me look at the censorship that we are facing.
[3:37:37.620 --> 3:37:41.620]  As Twitter continues to change their terms of service now to,
[3:37:41.620 --> 3:37:43.620]  to bend to the whims of the transgender crowd.
[3:37:43.620 --> 3:37:47.620]  You can't dead name, which I didn't even know what that was until a few days ago.
[3:37:47.620 --> 3:37:51.620]  You know, to mispronounce somebody, you could get your whole account wiped out.
[3:37:51.620 --> 3:37:55.620]  And I saw the article on Drudge that linked to infowars breaking.
[3:37:55.620 --> 3:37:59.620]  Despite massive censorship, Alex Jones still 40 most searched on YouTube.
[3:37:59.620 --> 3:38:01.620]  I thought that was very interesting.
[3:38:01.620 --> 3:38:07.620]  Even knowing he's been de-platformed, thrown off of every social media and video streaming outlet,
[3:38:07.620 --> 3:38:12.620]  still the 40 most searched, and that's probably even suppressed itself, that number,
[3:38:12.620 --> 3:38:16.620]  on YouTube, months and months and months after their attempt to make him disappear.
[3:38:16.620 --> 3:38:21.620]  And you talk about a testament to, you know, people still searching for that information,
[3:38:21.620 --> 3:38:23.620]  still wanting to find that information.
[3:38:23.620 --> 3:38:28.620]  Despite the best efforts of these left-wing lunatics in their censorship campaign,
[3:38:28.620 --> 3:38:34.620]  that just makes me smile to see that, that they are able to continue to reach that many people
[3:38:34.620 --> 3:38:39.620]  and get the word out, despite the de-platforming and basically blacklisting on the internet.
[3:38:39.620 --> 3:38:41.620]  Now, if we can, back to the caravan.
[3:38:41.620 --> 3:38:44.620]  And let's talk about the health risks associated with this caravan,
[3:38:44.620 --> 3:38:48.620]  because this is really something that is overlooked, especially by the left.
[3:38:48.620 --> 3:38:50.620]  They'll never address this at all.
[3:38:50.620 --> 3:38:52.620]  More agents are going to the border.
[3:38:52.620 --> 3:38:59.620]  Caravan health risk concerns, and this goes on to detail how the numbers of tuberculosis
[3:38:59.620 --> 3:39:03.620]  have the three cases of tuberculosis, four cases of HIV AIDS,
[3:39:03.620 --> 3:39:06.620]  101 cases of lice, four cases of chickenpox.
[3:39:06.620 --> 3:39:08.620]  That's just what has been documented.
[3:39:08.620 --> 3:39:17.620]  2,267 cases of health-related issues are already dubbed as a health crisis in this caravan.
[3:39:17.620 --> 3:39:23.620]  Authorities are also concerned about the potential cases of hepatitis because of unsanitary conditions.
[3:39:23.620 --> 3:39:26.620]  This was reported by Fox News earlier today.
[3:39:26.620 --> 3:39:32.620]  And we've seen the rise in this polio-like disease that is now spreading throughout America.
[3:39:32.620 --> 3:39:34.620]  And people are asking, you know, how does this start?
[3:39:34.620 --> 3:39:36.620]  Where did this come from? How does this happen here?
[3:39:36.620 --> 3:39:41.620]  Well, I'll tell you how. It's by importing not only the impoverished,
[3:39:41.620 --> 3:39:44.620]  the poor in welfare recipients, but it's also importing diseases.
[3:39:44.620 --> 3:39:48.620]  And this is what we need to do when we talk about a better system of vetting
[3:39:48.620 --> 3:39:50.620]  and checks and balances at the southern border.
[3:39:50.620 --> 3:39:52.620]  I mean, the wall would be great.
[3:39:52.620 --> 3:39:57.620]  Yes, it would be more symbolic than anything as you need multi-layer security,
[3:39:57.620 --> 3:40:01.620]  you know, from cameras, personnel, night vision, lasers, etc.
[3:40:01.620 --> 3:40:05.620]  But the vetting process is so important, getting to know who these people are.
[3:40:05.620 --> 3:40:08.620]  What are their health issues? What are their political beliefs?
[3:40:08.620 --> 3:40:11.620]  What are their aspirations and reasons for wanting to come into this country?
[3:40:11.620 --> 3:40:15.620]  Instead of just allowing anybody to come in like we had with the visa lottery program,
[3:40:15.620 --> 3:40:17.620]  which makes absolutely no sense,
[3:40:17.620 --> 3:40:21.620]  we could do a much better job of bringing the best and the brightest people
[3:40:21.620 --> 3:40:26.620]  who are going to and want to be productive and most importantly assimilate into our society.
[3:40:26.620 --> 3:40:28.620]  But the left is having none of it.
[3:40:28.620 --> 3:40:32.620]  If you oppose illegal immigration, you are considered a bigot.
[3:40:32.620 --> 3:40:34.620]  You are considered a racist.
[3:40:34.620 --> 3:40:43.620]  But tell me, what other crime does the mainstream media and the politically driven politicians in this country,
[3:40:43.620 --> 3:40:49.620]  what other federal crime do they urge people to break and encourage people to break?
[3:40:49.620 --> 3:40:53.620]  Can you think of one? Because I can't, except when it comes to immigration.
[3:40:53.620 --> 3:40:57.620]  And then you have these activist judges trying to overturn the bans
[3:40:57.620 --> 3:41:01.620]  and the different things President Trump has been doing by executive order.
[3:41:01.620 --> 3:41:08.620]  Never once questioning the authority of Barack Obama to start DACA through an executive order.
[3:41:08.620 --> 3:41:13.620]  But still, President Trump has been fighting or being fought against at every turn.
[3:41:13.620 --> 3:41:16.620]  And now we can move into the Robert Mueller investigation
[3:41:16.620 --> 3:41:19.620]  and what's happening with Jerome Corsi, what's happening with Roger Stone.
[3:41:19.620 --> 3:41:21.620]  It's very unfortunate.
[3:41:21.620 --> 3:41:24.620]  And the theme of the day, he's ruining people's lives.
[3:41:24.620 --> 3:41:27.620]  And I think Alan Dershowitz made a great point today
[3:41:27.620 --> 3:41:32.620]  where none of these people would be in criminal trouble if it wasn't for his investigation.
[3:41:32.620 --> 3:41:36.620]  And that speaks volumes as to what his intent truly is.
[3:41:36.620 --> 3:41:41.620]  $30 million, no evidence of any real wrongdoing other than process crimes
[3:41:41.620 --> 3:41:43.620]  that were created by his investigation.
[3:41:43.620 --> 3:41:46.620]  And here we are two years later.
[3:41:46.620 --> 3:41:48.620]  And what do we expect coming next?
[3:41:48.620 --> 3:41:54.620]  Well, we expect Robert Mueller to pull out all the stops, fabricate, lie, whatever he has to do
[3:41:54.620 --> 3:41:58.620]  to try to make it appear as though President Trump is unfit to be president
[3:41:58.620 --> 3:42:01.620]  because he stole the election from Hillary Clinton.
[3:42:01.620 --> 3:42:03.620]  You know, Mueller is there for only two reasons.
[3:42:03.620 --> 3:42:04.620]  Two reasons only.
[3:42:04.620 --> 3:42:11.620]  Number one, obviously is to protect the previous crimes, the crimes of Obama, the crimes of Hillary,
[3:42:11.620 --> 3:42:13.620]  the crimes of Brennan and such.
[3:42:13.620 --> 3:42:19.620]  And the other reason, of course, is to obstruct, at least in a legal sense, semi-quasi legal.
[3:42:19.620 --> 3:42:26.620]  I should say obstruct the agenda of President Trump and, of course, in so doing, creating misery.
[3:42:26.620 --> 3:42:28.620]  I know we're up against a break.
[3:42:28.620 --> 3:42:29.620]  Yeah, we're up against a break.
[3:42:29.620 --> 3:42:34.620]  And one of the bigger themes that we're missing with this whole migration issue,
[3:42:34.620 --> 3:42:38.620]  whether it's from Germany, which that is your country, your future now,
[3:42:38.620 --> 3:42:40.620]  the initiative I told you to send immigrants back,
[3:42:40.620 --> 3:42:46.620]  but it's the Agenda 21, Agenda 2030 globalist plan to erase borders, erase culture,
[3:42:46.620 --> 3:42:48.620]  and bring in their one world government.
[3:42:48.620 --> 3:42:50.620]  We'll be right back after this short break.
[3:43:19.620 --> 3:43:25.620]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health, joint health and cognitive health,
[3:43:25.620 --> 3:43:30.620]  aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain cognitive function, and more.
[3:43:30.620 --> 3:43:34.620]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas,

[3:46:24.620 --> 3:46:29.620]  We have seen what they want to do, they called it UN Agenda 21, now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[3:46:29.620 --> 3:46:34.620]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs,
[3:46:34.620 --> 3:46:41.620]  they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[3:46:41.620 --> 3:46:49.620]  That's the David Knight Show.
[3:46:49.620 --> 3:46:56.620]  at infowars.com forward slash show.
[3:46:56.620 --> 3:47:03.620]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:03.620 --> 3:47:12.620]  This is a live global exclusive.
[3:47:12.620 --> 3:47:23.620]  She is chained in front of Twitter that banned her for exposing Islamic genital mutilation of little girls up to age nine in the US.
[3:47:23.620 --> 3:47:28.620]  So she's chained herself up there, we have reporters there covering it.
[3:47:28.620 --> 3:47:34.620]  We are now starting to normalize these big tech social media companies like Facebook and Twitter are starting to normalize.
[3:47:34.620 --> 3:47:40.620]  This is live coverage of how conservatives are the new Jews in America, like Nazi Germany being censored.
[3:47:40.620 --> 3:47:43.620]  She's got big stickers up there pointing out that David Duke was fair.
[3:47:43.620 --> 3:47:47.620]  Congress will be on Twitter, on YouTube, and I'm not saying take them off of free speech.
[3:47:47.620 --> 3:47:55.620]  I don't agree with them, but she's saying that why has she been taken off for exposing general mutilation up to nine year old girls being kidnapped and their generals cut off.
[3:47:55.620 --> 3:47:59.620]  The federal judges ruling they can do it. Let's hear Laura Lummer.
[3:47:59.620 --> 3:48:05.620]  I'm anti termite. Well, what do you do when you have a termite infestation?
[3:48:05.620 --> 3:48:09.620]  You call the exterminator. He's obviously invoking Hitler, right?
[3:48:09.620 --> 3:48:14.620]  He's obviously invoking Hitler, calling for the extermination of Jews.
[3:48:14.620 --> 3:48:16.620]  He's calling for the extermination of Jews.
[3:48:16.620 --> 3:48:26.620]  Yet for Jack Dorsey, Lewis Farrakhan's tweet in which he said, I'm not an anti-Semite. I'm anti-termite. That was not a violation of their terms of service.
[3:48:26.620 --> 3:48:34.620]  They've had the security guards at Twitter trying to get the handcuffs unlocked, but locks they have. She has special handcuffs.
[3:48:34.620 --> 3:48:48.620]  Because Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg and many of these other multi-millionaire CEOs of these left-leaning big tech corporations, they want to silence me. They want to shut me down.
[3:48:48.620 --> 3:48:56.620]  And I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving anytime soon. I'm not going away anytime soon. You are not going to silence me.
[3:48:56.620 --> 3:49:05.620]  This is not just about me, though. This is about the millions of conservatives who are censored in silence on social media every single day.
[3:49:05.620 --> 3:49:11.620]  I'm going to read to you a couple tweets that Jack Dorsey has allowed to stay on Twitter.
[3:49:11.620 --> 3:49:21.620]  Would anybody like a copy? I have here thousands of examples of tweets that are still on Twitter.
[3:49:21.620 --> 3:49:28.620]  Laura Lohmer, incredible activist, the best to get a journalist, chained outside Twitter.
[3:49:28.620 --> 3:49:33.620]  She was banned last week permanently for saying the cutting little girl's genitals off is bad.
[3:49:33.620 --> 3:49:45.620]  I hate white people. Fuck white people. Goddamn white people are the worst. Kill all white people.
[3:49:45.620 --> 3:49:55.620]  I'm not anti-Semites. I'm anti-Turneite. This is all still on Twitter. All of these tweets right here are still on Twitter.
[3:49:55.620 --> 3:49:57.620]  This is live and raw.
[3:49:57.620 --> 3:50:05.620]  According to Twitter, it's okay if you want to preach hate against the Jews. It's okay if you want to preach hate against white people.
[3:50:05.620 --> 3:50:16.620]  It's okay, according to Jack Dorsey, if you want to preach hate against conservatives, right? You don't get banned for that.
[3:50:16.620 --> 3:50:21.620]  That's not a violation of the terms of service. If you're a Jewish conservative journalist like myself exposing these people, people left this.
[3:50:21.620 --> 3:50:24.620]  Or if you are just a conservative in general.
[3:50:24.620 --> 3:50:28.620]  I don't want to be clear. We've got seven minutes left of live broadcast here.
[3:50:28.620 --> 3:50:35.620]  The War Room of Ellen Schreuer is about to begin. 3 p.m. Central every day. We've got these live feeds off Facebook and Twitter.
[3:50:35.620 --> 3:50:38.620]  The backup feeds. They'll try to ban those. Then we can see this.
[3:50:38.620 --> 3:50:40.620]  At infowars.com.
[3:50:40.620 --> 3:50:45.620]  And we're going to have it. We also have Skype room back up.
[3:50:45.620 --> 3:50:48.620]  This will continue as the police officer is coming.
[3:50:48.620 --> 3:50:51.620]  She has handcuffs. They're going to use jaws of life on.
[3:50:51.620 --> 3:50:58.620]  Custom-made handcuffs. Laura Loomer. Our brothers and sisters in the United Kingdom have to fear for our rest.
[3:50:58.620 --> 3:51:04.620]  They have to fear that they're going to have their doors knocked down in the middle of the night as they post wrong things.
[3:51:04.620 --> 3:51:10.620]  Everyone go to infowars.com. We're going to post this on the front page. Laura Loomer changed herself to the live.
[3:51:10.620 --> 3:51:14.620]  Laura Loomer changed herself to the front.
[3:51:14.620 --> 3:51:21.620]  The doors of Twitter in New York to protest censorship of conservatives. And get it to drudge, guys, right now. Get a blurb up.
[3:51:21.620 --> 3:51:25.620]  Get the live feed up. Add the War Room feed. We're about to end.
[3:51:25.620 --> 3:51:31.620]  They intentionally put Tommy Robinson in a prison cell next to the people who he was trying to...
[3:51:31.620 --> 3:51:34.620]  And guys, get me another chair set up by Ellen. I'm going to go in there.
[3:51:34.620 --> 3:51:45.620]  He has to endure all of this punishment and torture. He invites violations because our social media companies, Twitter, Facebook, Apple, Google, Instagram,
[3:51:45.620 --> 3:51:55.620]  they are essentially upholding Sharia. Silicon Valley is essentially upholding Sharia when they decide to ban me for posting facts about Islam.
[3:51:55.620 --> 3:52:02.620]  When they decide to ban me for posting facts about Sharia law or criticizing an anti-Jewish Muslim country.
[3:52:02.620 --> 3:52:08.620]  We're watching us on infowars.com with a live feed. You've got to share this feed to everybody. That's the way we get around the censors.
[3:52:08.620 --> 3:52:10.620]  Millions are watching right now on our feeds.
[3:52:10.620 --> 3:52:14.620]  We're completely incompatible with our United States Constitution.
[3:52:14.620 --> 3:52:16.620]  And here I am.
[3:52:16.620 --> 3:52:18.620]  Laura Loomer.
[3:52:18.620 --> 3:52:21.620]  You know, if Jack Dorsey wants to come outside...
[3:52:21.620 --> 3:52:24.620]  Change to the New York headquarters of Twitter. Let's go full screen to her.
[3:52:24.620 --> 3:52:31.620] ...to say things like they want to assassinate President Trump. I want to shoot Trump in the head. Fuck white people.
[3:52:31.620 --> 3:52:34.620]  All white people are racist.
[3:52:34.620 --> 3:52:36.620]  God, can someone just shoot Trump already?
[3:52:36.620 --> 3:52:40.620]  I mean, why is this allowed on Twitter, Jack Dorsey?
[3:52:40.620 --> 3:52:43.620]  I want to know how that's an I hate speech.
[3:52:43.620 --> 3:52:53.620]  But my tweet up there isn't it's ironic how the Twitter moments used to celebrate women, LGBTQ and minorities is a picture of Ilhan Omar.
[3:52:53.620 --> 3:53:00.620]  And I had a sign here that I wanted to show you guys, but Twitter confiscated it.
[3:53:00.620 --> 3:53:05.620]  So already, here in America, you know, I have a right to protest.
[3:53:05.620 --> 3:53:08.620]  I have a right to peacefully protest here.
[3:53:08.620 --> 3:53:15.620]  And I can't even protest because even on the outside, Jack Dorsey is sending his goons to confiscate my sign.
[3:53:15.620 --> 3:53:25.620]  I want to know why Jew Hatred is okay at Twitter, where Lewis Farrakhan can essentially call for the extermination of Jews, just like Hitler did.
[3:53:25.620 --> 3:53:29.620]  But then a Jewish journalist is shut down simply for reporting the truth.
[3:53:29.620 --> 3:53:34.620]  I want to know.
[3:53:34.620 --> 3:53:37.620]  I want to know.
[3:53:37.620 --> 3:53:43.620]  And he won't give me back my sign.
[3:53:43.620 --> 3:53:51.620]  There you can see my sign right there.
[3:53:51.620 --> 3:53:59.620]  Again, Laura Loomer has reached hundreds of millions of people. She's an incredible investigative journalist, exposed the Vegas mass shooting.
[3:53:59.620 --> 3:54:02.620]  She's confronted Hillary Clinton, so many others.
[3:54:02.620 --> 3:54:07.620]  She exposed all these radical Islamists getting elected to Congress, people that have been in serious trouble.
[3:54:07.620 --> 3:54:14.620]  And the sexual mutilization of little girls in the U.S. that's now being legalized in multiple states to cut little girls genitals off.
[3:54:14.620 --> 3:54:20.620]  There's millions of conservatives all across the world who have been silenced and censored by these big tech corporations.
[3:54:20.620 --> 3:54:24.620]  And she's there.
[3:54:24.620 --> 3:54:28.620]  She's chained to the front steps to the front doors of her radio listener.
[3:54:28.620 --> 3:54:35.620]  She's chained to the doors at 249 there in Manhattan at the main New York headquarters.
[3:54:35.620 --> 3:54:45.620]  And she's put up big signs saying that Lewis Farrakhan is still on Twitter, but that she's been taken off for exposing sexual mutilization of girls.
[3:54:45.620 --> 3:54:50.620]  I'm inventing words, mutilization, sexual mutilization.
[3:54:50.620 --> 3:55:00.620]  He must certainly have that word, sexual mutilation of little girls, sexual castration of girls.
[3:55:00.620 --> 3:55:02.620]  Well, the police are showing up right now.
[3:55:02.620 --> 3:55:03.620]  Dr. John, the police.
[3:55:03.620 --> 3:55:05.620]  Yeah, I will get arrested, but I'm willing to go to jail.
[3:55:05.620 --> 3:55:06.620]  All right.
[3:55:06.620 --> 3:55:07.620]  Just like Tommy Robinson went to jail.
[3:55:07.620 --> 3:55:11.620]  We're on satellite feed, so the Alex Jones show has to end in two minutes.
[3:55:11.620 --> 3:55:18.620]  Everyone wants to go to infowars.com for a slash show, the war room.
[3:55:18.620 --> 3:55:31.620]  And folks, this is a viral event.
[3:55:31.620 --> 3:55:33.620]  She's doing this for attention for everybody.
[3:55:33.620 --> 3:55:41.620]  No, look at my tweet and compare that Lewis Farrakhan posted, I'm not an anti-Semite, I'm anti-Termite, and then he wasn't kicked off Twitter.
[3:55:41.620 --> 3:55:42.620]  But then here's my tweet.
[3:55:42.620 --> 3:55:44.620]  This is the ironic of the Twitter moment.
[3:55:44.620 --> 3:55:45.620]  Here's the police.
[3:55:45.620 --> 3:55:46.620]  Let's hear this.
[3:55:46.620 --> 3:55:47.620]  Excuse me.
[3:55:47.620 --> 3:55:48.620]  Hi.
[3:55:48.620 --> 3:55:49.620]  Hi, officer.
[3:55:49.620 --> 3:55:50.620]  Hi.
[3:55:50.620 --> 3:55:51.620]  Are you protesting?
[3:55:51.620 --> 3:55:52.620]  Yeah.
[3:55:52.620 --> 3:55:53.620]  Twitter.
[3:55:53.620 --> 3:55:54.620]  Can we stop you one second?
[3:55:54.620 --> 3:55:55.620]  Yeah.
[3:55:55.620 --> 3:55:56.620]  So you're being recorded just like you guys were recording me?
[3:55:56.620 --> 3:55:57.620]  Yes.
[3:55:57.620 --> 3:55:58.620]  You cannot block the door.
[3:55:58.620 --> 3:55:59.620]  You can stand.
[3:55:59.620 --> 3:56:00.620]  Well, they can come out.
[3:56:00.620 --> 3:56:02.620]  From that point, you must move from the door.
[3:56:02.620 --> 3:56:03.620]  That's not a request.
[3:56:03.620 --> 3:56:04.620]  No handcuffs.
[3:56:04.620 --> 3:56:05.620]  Yeah.
[3:56:05.620 --> 3:56:06.620]  Do you have keys?
[3:56:06.620 --> 3:56:07.620]  I suggest you take them off.
[3:56:07.620 --> 3:56:08.620]  You try to take them off.
[3:56:08.620 --> 3:56:09.620]  I don't know if they're going to come off.
[3:56:09.620 --> 3:56:13.620]  They can take the key thing or whatever.
[3:56:13.620 --> 3:56:14.620]  We'll have the issue.
[3:56:14.620 --> 3:56:15.620]  Come take them off if you don't want to.
[3:56:15.620 --> 3:56:16.620]  You don't want to take them off.
[3:56:16.620 --> 3:56:17.620]  You put them on yourself.
[3:56:17.620 --> 3:56:18.620]  All right.
[3:56:18.620 --> 3:56:19.620]  You understand?
[3:56:19.620 --> 3:56:20.620]  Yeah.
[3:56:20.620 --> 3:56:21.620]  You're going to end up getting arrested if you don't remove them.
[3:56:21.620 --> 3:56:22.620]  Step back.
[3:56:22.620 --> 3:56:23.620]  You guys can film.
[3:56:23.620 --> 3:56:24.620]  Just step back, please.
[3:56:24.620 --> 3:56:25.620]  I'm not going to remove the handcuffs.
[3:56:25.620 --> 3:56:30.620]  The system is silencing everybody who's patriotic, who stands up for speech.
[3:56:30.620 --> 3:56:36.620]  It stands up against girls being sexually mutilated under radical Islamist real law.
[3:56:36.620 --> 3:56:38.620]  It's sexually mutilated.
[3:56:38.620 --> 3:56:39.620]  Tell me what?
[3:56:39.620 --> 3:56:44.620]  Now they're trying to use police handcuff keys, but she has special handcuffs that are designed
[3:56:44.620 --> 3:56:45.620]  that they can't do that.
[3:56:45.620 --> 3:56:48.620]  And we have these simply because I was exposing to people.
[3:56:48.620 --> 3:56:50.620]  And again, this is the third dimension.
[3:56:50.620 --> 3:56:52.620]  They ban us on the internet.
[3:56:52.620 --> 3:56:56.620]  We then physically start coming out and peacefully exposing them.
[3:56:56.620 --> 3:57:01.620]  You guys think it's okay for a terrorist organization to come off in the middle of Brotherhood?
[3:57:01.620 --> 3:57:04.620]  The only thing for media like the other day was the guy who had a problem with the president.
[3:57:04.620 --> 3:57:07.620]  Hey, this live feed is about to end.
[3:57:07.620 --> 3:57:11.620]  The main feed's posted at infowars.com, an article.
[3:57:11.620 --> 3:57:18.620]  Laura Loomer changed herself to the front doors of Twitter to protest citizenship and
[3:57:18.620 --> 3:57:19.620]  conservatives.
[3:57:19.620 --> 3:57:22.620]  The war room starts in one minute.
[3:57:22.620 --> 3:57:26.620]  Infowars.com forward slash show, one minute.
[3:57:26.620 --> 3:57:27.620]  The feed will continue.
[3:57:27.620 --> 3:57:30.620]  I'm going to go get in studio with Owen Troyer right now.
[3:57:30.620 --> 3:57:31.620]  Everybody, this is happening now.
[3:57:31.620 --> 3:57:33.620]  We're fighting back against the censorship right now.
[3:57:33.620 --> 3:57:35.620]  More police are showing up.
[3:57:35.620 --> 3:57:37.620]  Live feeds, infowars.com.
[3:57:37.620 --> 3:57:38.620]  Stay where this is on the bullhorn.
[3:57:38.620 --> 3:57:39.620]  Wow.
[3:57:39.620 --> 3:57:40.620]  This is exciting.
[3:57:40.620 --> 3:57:43.620]  Our crew's there.
[3:57:43.620 --> 3:57:49.620]  All over the world, a rain of censorship is coming in in a perfect storm of dying corporate
[3:57:49.620 --> 3:57:51.620]  media, big mega corporations.
[3:57:51.620 --> 3:57:55.620]  Authoritarian regimes like communist China, the EU, the Democratic Party and others working
[3:57:55.620 --> 3:58:00.620]  in concert to shut down loyal Americans and other loyal nationalists.
[3:58:00.620 --> 3:58:02.620]  And it's praised by the left all over the world.
[3:58:02.620 --> 3:58:07.620]  That's why it's so critical that this Christmas, all of you remember that without you supporting
[3:58:07.620 --> 3:58:09.620]  infowars financially, we will be shut down.
[3:58:09.620 --> 3:58:10.620]  We make it easy to do.
[3:58:10.620 --> 3:58:14.620]  We've got Cyber Week going right now, extending our big mega sales from Black Friday.
[3:58:14.620 --> 3:58:19.620]  Wall supplies last, water filtration, air filtration, incredible supplements, T-shirts,
[3:58:19.620 --> 3:58:20.620]  books, films.
[3:58:20.620 --> 3:58:23.620]  It's all there and it makes the information work possible against the globalists.
[3:58:23.620 --> 3:58:26.620]  So I want to thank you this Christmas for your support and I want to ask you for your
[3:58:26.620 --> 3:58:27.620]  continued support.
[3:58:27.620 --> 3:58:31.620]  It's a 360 win because these products are great, free shipping store wide, 50 to 75%
[3:58:31.620 --> 3:58:34.620]  off across the board and double Patriot points.
[3:58:34.620 --> 3:58:40.620]  Right now at infowarsstore.com, recall toll free, triple 82533139 because when you take
[3:58:40.620 --> 3:58:43.620]  action, nothing on earth can stop you.
[3:58:43.620 --> 3:58:48.620]  I just want everybody to count the cost here as we enter the last month of 2018.
[3:58:48.620 --> 3:58:52.620]  I want to thank you for all of your support and I want to just remind you that infowars
[3:58:52.620 --> 3:58:56.220]  isn't perfect but we're fighting as hard as we can and without you, we won't be here.
[3:58:56.220 --> 3:59:00.620]  That's why we're having Cyber Monday turned into Cyber Week and it's happening now at
[3:59:00.620 --> 3:59:01.620]  infowarsstore.com.
[3:59:01.620 --> 3:59:06.120]  The biggest sales ever as we attempt to sell all the great inventory so that we can hopefully
[3:59:06.120 --> 3:59:09.420]  be capitalized to fund ourselves at least a few months into next year.
[3:59:09.420 --> 3:59:12.620]  I don't have to tell you, we've been under total siege and harassment and attacks.
[3:59:12.620 --> 3:59:14.620]  It would take an hour to go over to some of it.
[3:59:14.620 --> 3:59:19.620]  So right now at infowarsstore.com, there is the revolution of products that are excellent
[3:59:19.620 --> 3:59:25.620]  and the revolution of funding info wars that is now in the absolute thick of the battle
[3:59:25.620 --> 3:59:30.620]  fighting for the human spirit and human destiny for my children and your children and all
[3:59:30.620 --> 3:59:32.620]  of our shared futures together.
[3:59:32.620 --> 3:59:35.620]  Info wars will talk about the forbidden taboo subjects.
[3:59:35.620 --> 3:59:40.620]  We will stand up for human life and human destiny and we will fight until the end.
[3:59:40.620 --> 3:59:42.620]  With your help, humanity has a chance.
[3:59:42.620 --> 3:59:44.620]  Thank you all for your support.
