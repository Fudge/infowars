[00:00.000 --> 00:27.200]  Well, we have a ton of news to be covering the entire waterfront constellation of news
[00:27.200 --> 00:34.560]  on my desk. It's going to be a loaded transmission, but there's one thing we need to understand.
[00:35.680 --> 00:39.200]  And Greg Rees highlights it in his most recent special report.
[00:40.640 --> 00:47.440]  You see the world elite, the elite class, the control freak, tyrannical, authoritarian,
[00:47.440 --> 00:54.480]  communistic, fascistic, kleptocrat elite class has made the same realizations as you have.
[00:54.480 --> 01:03.680]  They just approach it differently as they want to transcend it and they just want to have their
[01:03.680 --> 01:09.120]  great reset. So understand all the problems that we talk about. The elites agree, but their solution
[01:09.120 --> 01:13.520]  is just wipe out humanity and civilization as we know it so that they can have a great reset
[01:13.520 --> 01:27.600]  and build back better. Here's the latest from Greg Rees. In 2020, Klaus Schwab of the World
[01:27.600 --> 01:34.400]  Economic Forum warned of an impending cyber attack that will take down all of society.
[01:34.400 --> 01:44.480]  We all know that still pay insufficient attention to the frightening scenario of a comprehensive
[01:44.480 --> 01:54.560]  cyber attack which would bring to a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital
[01:54.560 --> 02:03.200]  services, our society as a whole. In 2022, Joe Biden stated that sending tanks to Ukraine
[02:03.200 --> 02:10.640]  is called World War III. The idea, the idea that we're going to send in offensive equipment and
[02:10.640 --> 02:17.680]  have planes and tanks and trains going in with American pilots and American crews, just understand.
[02:18.480 --> 02:24.080]  Don't kid yourself, no matter what you all say. That's called World War III.
[02:25.360 --> 02:32.480]  Earlier this month, managing director of the World Economic Forum, Jeremy Jurgens, says that a
[02:32.480 --> 02:39.840]  catastrophic cyber event will likely occur in the next two years. The most striking finding that we
[02:39.840 --> 02:48.480]  found is that 93% of cyber leaders and 86% of cyber business leaders believe that the geopolitical
[02:48.480 --> 02:56.800]  instability makes a catastrophic cyber event likely in the next two years. This far exceeds
[02:56.800 --> 03:04.560]  anything that we've seen in previous surveys. This week, a German foreign minister casually stated
[03:04.560 --> 03:10.720]  that they are at war with Russia. And therefore, I've said already in the last days, yes, we have
[03:10.720 --> 03:17.680]  to do more to defend Ukraine. Yes, we have to do more also on tanks. But the most important
[03:17.680 --> 03:25.120]  and the crucial part is that we do it together and that we do not do the blame game in Europe
[03:25.120 --> 03:31.360]  because we are fighting a war against Russia and not against each other. Thank you.
[03:32.720 --> 03:39.360]  President Joe Biden responds by sending 31M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine.
[03:40.000 --> 03:46.880]  Today, I'm announcing that the United States will be sending 31 Abrams tanks to Ukraine.
[03:46.880 --> 03:53.680]  And now, all of the media is warning of nuclear war or a Russian cyber attack.
[03:53.680 --> 04:00.800]  That'll be the first time they actually discuss it in Congress when we are hit with a massive
[04:00.800 --> 04:08.640]  cyber attack from Russia in response. If you are not suspicious by now, then you are not
[04:08.640 --> 04:14.800]  paying attention. Our government is not at war with Russia. They are at war with the American
[04:14.800 --> 04:21.600]  people. And in order to build back better, they need their cyber attack. Now they have a cover
[04:21.600 --> 04:29.120]  story and the media is sticking their finger into the PTSD wounds of all Americans so that
[04:29.120 --> 04:35.840]  we do nothing but sit at home in fear and wait for the end. Reporting for Infowars,
[04:36.480 --> 04:41.120]  this is Greg Rees. Well, you know, the more I think about it, the more I realize this two-year
[04:41.120 --> 04:46.480]  window before the presidential election is maybe the most dangerous two years we face,
[04:46.480 --> 04:51.280]  not just as a nation, but as humanity on planet Earth. But you notice they keep threatening
[04:51.280 --> 04:55.840]  this cyber attack, but they never want to tell you who. Now we all know who they want to blame,
[04:56.560 --> 04:58.880]  but we all know, of course, who it would really be.
[05:09.360 --> 05:12.720]  Hey, what's up, bone? Hey, McBreen. What's going on, man?
[05:14.000 --> 05:18.480]  Hey, really like that work you did on the AI piece? I'm going to use that on the show today.
[05:18.480 --> 05:21.600]  Right on. I worked hard on that. I'm working on another project, so I'm going to be up
[05:21.600 --> 05:28.240]  late again tonight, and I was hoping he had some Brain Force Plus. Oh, um, no.
[05:29.200 --> 05:32.320]  No, nothing. What about Brain Force Ultra?
[05:38.080 --> 05:42.960]  No. Okay. Yeah. Thanks anyway. Yeah.
[05:42.960 --> 05:46.880]  Yeah. Good luck with that project, though.
[05:49.120 --> 05:58.880]  Get your Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra right now at infostore.com.
[05:58.880 --> 06:08.880]  Yeah.
[06:10.400 --> 06:17.200]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[06:17.200 --> 06:29.360]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones and now your host Owen Troyer.
[06:29.360 --> 06:39.120]  Wow, ladies and gentlemen on this Monday, January 30th, 2023. We really have the picture
[06:39.120 --> 06:48.160]  and we're going to put it on display today. We really have the picture of what's really
[06:48.160 --> 06:54.480]  happening with all these different news stories, not too much mystery in today's transmission.
[06:55.120 --> 07:03.280]  A lot of conclusions will be reached. Here are the big stories we're going to be covering
[07:03.280 --> 07:10.000]  today, the situation in Ukraine, obviously. Now, I'll read you this headline right now
[07:10.880 --> 07:17.200]  and let you have the natural instinctual response to it so that you can understand
[07:17.200 --> 07:22.720]  just how out of control the situation is. This is a headline from last night.
[07:25.440 --> 07:30.960]  Zelensky Ukraine requests more weapons and faster.
[07:30.960 --> 07:38.960]  So, just sent a bunch of tanks, just sent more tanks, just sent more missiles and ammunition
[07:38.960 --> 07:46.400]  and billions of dollars and upon receiving that and opening it, Zelensky says, I need more and I
[07:46.400 --> 07:57.440]  need it faster. Huh, okay. Now, that just tells you how out of control the situation is and how
[07:57.440 --> 08:04.160]  desperate Ukraine is. Oh, I thought they're winning. No, folks, no. No, it's actually a devastating loss.
[08:05.200 --> 08:12.240]  What's been going on in Ukraine, but that just shows you how ridiculous and out of
[08:12.240 --> 08:18.640]  control the situation is. The realness of it and the global threat of it will be explaining today
[08:18.640 --> 08:30.400]  on this Alex Jones show. Then you have the economic situation, which is funny in a way
[08:31.680 --> 08:37.040]  to watch the Democrats and their friends in the media. It's the same difference.
[08:38.880 --> 08:42.560]  Out of one side of their mouth, they're telling you how great the economy is,
[08:42.560 --> 08:47.760]  how great Joe Biden has done for the economy and then out of the other side of their mouth,
[08:47.760 --> 08:52.400]  they're complaining about how bad the economy is and I've got all the receipts, all the proof
[08:52.400 --> 08:57.040]  right here today. Literally, it's one headline, Joe Biden doing the best job, best economic president
[08:57.040 --> 09:01.040]  ever and then the next headline, Americans are poorer than they've ever been. Nobody can even
[09:01.040 --> 09:09.520]  afford rent. So which one is it? Is Joe Biden the economic master or is the economy tanking?
[09:10.800 --> 09:15.680]  Which one is it? Now, to understand the psychology of the left is to understand it like this.
[09:15.680 --> 09:21.600]  It really doesn't matter what the reality of the situation is. What matters is that they get ahead
[09:21.600 --> 09:28.400]  of the narrative, they control the narrative, which ultimately means they lie to you. So they have to
[09:28.400 --> 09:32.160]  tell you that Joe Biden is the greatest economic president of all time because they have to lie
[09:32.160 --> 09:37.360]  to you about that. They lied you about everything else when it comes to Joe Biden and now that
[09:37.360 --> 09:42.560]  you're actually feeling the economic pinch of Democrat party policies, they have to continually
[09:42.560 --> 09:49.040]  lie to you telling you how great Joe Biden has done. But see, they always love the class warfare
[09:49.840 --> 09:56.240]  and they always love the virtue signaling for the poor class for political leverage.
[09:56.800 --> 10:01.840]  So therefore, they also have to tell you how much people are struggling, hoping they can use that
[10:01.840 --> 10:06.480]  for political leverage while they're telling you how great Biden is. I know it doesn't make any sense,
[10:06.480 --> 10:14.720]  you have a brain, you can think this is what's going on. Then, and this is what really makes
[10:14.720 --> 10:22.800]  the situation in Ukraine even more dangerous, the Biden crime family details are truly coming out.
[10:24.000 --> 10:30.160]  And I mean, look, folks, from a self preservation mechanism, I think about this,
[10:30.160 --> 10:37.280]  not from a patriotic mechanism of, oh boy, I don't want to see Joe Biden fall. That would be such
[10:37.280 --> 10:42.160]  an embarrassment for the United States. No, justice be done, may the heavens fall in this case.
[10:43.360 --> 10:49.920]  What's scary about all the details with Hunter Biden and Joe Biden and their crimes acting as
[10:49.920 --> 10:56.800]  foreign agents illegally, and now reasonable people are starting to realize that it looks like
[10:56.800 --> 11:01.440]  China is the one that made the call for Biden to pull us out of Afghanistan. That was China told
[11:01.440 --> 11:05.760]  Biden to do that, yanked his chain, got it done. Now they're in there getting the resources. Now
[11:05.760 --> 11:12.160]  they're in there running everything. Now they're in there going to be at the strategic air base,
[11:13.600 --> 11:23.840]  all Biden taking the need to China. But that's not even what's scary. What's scary is would Joe Biden
[11:23.840 --> 11:30.880]  or would the deep state or would the Democrat party see a war with Russia or a World War
[11:30.880 --> 11:38.960]  III scenario as a good distraction from Joe Biden's crimes being exposed? And you might say,
[11:38.960 --> 11:44.160]  they can't be that mad. They can't be that insane. They wouldn't start World War III over that, would
[11:44.160 --> 11:50.560]  they? If you have to ask yourself that question, you clearly still don't understand who we're
[11:50.560 --> 11:56.640]  dealing with. Of course they would, not only because their arrogance and their hubris makes
[11:56.640 --> 12:05.680]  them think they'd be above it, but because these are mad, psychotic, sociopathic criminals that
[12:05.680 --> 12:11.920]  are so out of touch with reality, they either don't even realize or care how it would impact them.
[12:11.920 --> 12:20.080]  Wow, that's heavy stuff. But then there's this.
[12:23.520 --> 12:30.000]  We know from official government data at least 50,000 Americans have died from the COVID-19 vaccine.
[12:31.520 --> 12:36.640]  Now people who run actuaries and insurance data and follow death rates
[12:36.640 --> 12:46.320]  or if you've just been following the news, we have enough data and enough numbers
[12:47.440 --> 12:53.360]  for experts to crunch everything they can see in regards to the vaccine deaths and the excess
[12:53.360 --> 13:00.400]  deaths and the died suddenly and the insurance numbers and everything else. And now expert analysis
[13:00.400 --> 13:07.360]  is landing to the conclusion that it looks like about 200 to 300,000 Americans have died from the
[13:07.360 --> 13:14.480]  COVID-19 vaccine. And then that's just based off raw data of some of the data points I've mentioned
[13:14.480 --> 13:25.600]  here. So that's, I mean, what's the bigger story here? To me, that still takes the top story simply
[13:25.600 --> 13:30.880]  because we're living it right now. We're still not fully into this war with Russia. They're still
[13:30.880 --> 13:35.520]  slow walking us into that. So when that happens, I mean, right now in Ukraine, that's the biggest
[13:35.520 --> 13:39.680]  deal. There are a bunch of Ukrainians dying. Absolutely that's happening. They're losing the
[13:39.680 --> 13:45.200]  war big time. US policy just putting them out to slaughter. Zelensky just putting them out to
[13:45.200 --> 13:52.320]  slaughter, asking anybody else to step up to get slaughtered. Truly maniacal stuff. But for Ukraine
[13:52.320 --> 13:56.880]  that might be the biggest issue. For me here domestically, well, I'm still not dealing with
[13:56.880 --> 14:02.080]  that yet. Biden still hasn't fully launched the world war against Russia. Russia's really kind
[14:02.080 --> 14:09.920]  of just sat back and been tolerant of all the antics of Biden in the West. So no, I'm sitting
[14:09.920 --> 14:17.120]  here. I'm watching friends and family get injured from these vaccines or die. And now we have the
[14:17.120 --> 14:23.120]  Pfizer executive on the Project Veritas tape, multiple Pfizer executives, by the way, the last
[14:23.120 --> 14:28.800]  one just is the most recent and most viral, where you can just see everything Pfizer's up to, the
[14:28.800 --> 14:36.480]  lying, the manipulation, the gain of function research, the cover up of COVID-19, the development
[14:36.480 --> 14:44.320]  of the next COVID-19 in a lab, potentially right here in New York, by the way. Now, why isn't the
[14:44.320 --> 14:49.920]  American media interested in this story? Do I have to tell you why you know why? Because the
[14:49.920 --> 14:58.080]  American media is bought and paid for by Pfizer. Same with most of our government. So that becomes a
[14:58.080 --> 15:07.440]  problem. But you know what's interesting? China is investigating Pfizer because of the Project
[15:07.440 --> 15:23.520]  Veritas video. China, China is investigating Pfizer, not us, China. Now, I'm not having some sort of
[15:23.520 --> 15:28.160]  positive look at this like, oh, China's going to help us. China's going to do something good here.
[15:28.160 --> 15:37.120]  No, it's obviously just a political game they're playing, and maybe even a game of blackmail.
[15:39.040 --> 15:43.920]  And then we've got more. I've got political news. I've got the Democrat riots that they tried to
[15:43.920 --> 15:49.280]  pop off all weekend, but they only got about 10% of the damage and the violence that they wanted.
[15:51.920 --> 15:55.600]  And what they're doing to your kids at school, folks, it's all coming up today on the Alex Jones

[20:31.200 --> 20:36.480]  car theft? What do you do when crime is skyrocketing in your city in Chicago?
[20:36.480 --> 20:41.760]  You hit the streets and dance. Just ask Mayor Lori Lightfoot. Yeah, get down boogie, Lori.
[20:49.360 --> 20:53.920]  In fact, guys, let's go ahead and pull up. What do you got, guys? You want to have a little fun
[20:53.920 --> 20:59.520]  today? Let's do a little over under. Over under five and a half shot dead in Chicago this weekend.
[20:59.520 --> 21:05.520]  Is that too cold? Is that a little too harsh to play that game? Lori Lightfoot's dancing in the
[21:05.520 --> 21:11.120]  streets. So let's have some fun over under five and a half shot Chicago this weekend. I'm going to go
[21:11.120 --> 21:17.520]  over even though it was cold. Not I'm going to say fatally shot, not just shot over under 20 shot.
[21:17.520 --> 21:22.400]  Well, let's go over under 20 shot, five and a half fatally. We'll get the crew to pull up these
[21:22.400 --> 21:26.560]  numbers. Hey, Lori Lightfoot's having fun. Why can't we have some fun? I just want to have fun
[21:26.560 --> 21:31.680]  like Lori Lightfoot. She's dancing in the street. That's the mayor of Chicago dancing on the blood
[21:31.680 --> 21:41.600]  of the innocent. I'm going to go over under five and a half fatally shot 20 overall shot in weekend
[21:42.240 --> 21:46.240]  gun violence in Chicago where they have nice strict gun control laws, by the way,
[21:46.800 --> 21:54.160]  nice strict gun control laws. Hmm. Ooh, we'll double the under. Wow. I hope you took the under on that
[21:54.160 --> 22:01.520]  one. You did well. 16 shot to fatally weekend gun violent Chicago. Okay, light weekend,
[22:01.520 --> 22:04.160]  light weekend there, only two shot and killed only 16 shot.
[22:06.080 --> 22:10.800]  Okay, so I guess we know why Lori Lightfoot was dancing that that's about half the normal
[22:10.800 --> 22:16.720]  numbers there in Chicago, probably even like a third. So congratulations, Chicago, your mayor
[22:16.720 --> 22:22.400]  is dancing on the blood of the innocent dancing on the on the graves of the innocent dancing on
[22:22.400 --> 22:27.840]  the carcasses of children hit with stray bullets. She's dancing in the streets. It's a good time.
[22:28.480 --> 22:34.080]  Only two shot and killed this weekend in Chicago, only 16 hit with bullets. Congratulations,
[22:34.080 --> 22:43.440]  Lori. You have finally lowered the crime rates way to go. Yeah, boogie on down. Gotta love that.
[22:44.720 --> 22:51.760]  Got to love that. So, uh, you know, we're looking at only about 10 people shot and killed in Chicago
[22:51.760 --> 22:56.480]  first month of 2023. That's a reason to dance if you're Lori Lightfoot. All right.
[22:59.120 --> 23:05.040]  Now, we got another issue that I'm going to highlight here in a minute before we really
[23:05.040 --> 23:12.400]  delve into the big stories. But ladies and gentlemen, big ups to this audience. And I don't,
[23:12.400 --> 23:16.720]  I don't say this as a knock against myself. I just understand how media works. And quite
[23:16.720 --> 23:22.720]  frankly, I'm the same way. When Alex Jones is not hosting the Alex Jones show, a lot of people tune
[23:22.720 --> 23:26.160]  out. And I know people call in and say, Oh, when you're great and everything, this is not a, this
[23:26.160 --> 23:32.800]  is not a knock on myself. It's just the fact when people tune in to go to the Alex Jones show,
[23:32.800 --> 23:37.440]  they expect to hear Alex Jones. If they don't, most people just tune out. Now we do actually
[23:37.440 --> 23:43.120]  a good job of audience retention, whether it's me or other guests, so filling in for Alex,
[23:43.120 --> 23:47.360]  because it's the information here that's the most hardcore. And a lot of the audience just
[23:47.360 --> 23:53.840]  tunes in for the truth that they know they can't get anywhere else. But normally when I'm filling
[23:53.840 --> 24:01.520]  in for Alex, our sales rates are just plummeting, which is obviously bad for business. Now,
[24:02.480 --> 24:07.200]  it's not been so bad this time. And so I want to thank the audience, but folks continue to come
[24:07.200 --> 24:12.480]  through for us at infowarstore.com, specifically when Alex is out. Part of the problem is he goes
[24:12.480 --> 24:16.800]  on vacation. He's constantly needing to see what the numbers are and the sales numbers are coming
[24:16.800 --> 24:21.600]  in. And if they aren't good, he gets himself in a little bit of a tizzy. He calls in, he feels he
[24:21.600 --> 24:27.040]  needs to go back to work, get on the air. That's fine. We all love him on the air, but hard for
[24:27.040 --> 24:33.680]  the man to take some time off. So little pressure relief, some pretty good numbers this weekend,
[24:33.680 --> 24:37.520]  all things considered, not where they need to be. But with Alex out, all things considered,
[24:37.520 --> 24:42.080]  not bad. So I appreciate that. But let's step it up again today. Alex is going to be back on
[24:42.080 --> 24:46.480]  Wednesday. So let's give it two more days and let's really hit that website hard. Let's hit that
[24:46.480 --> 24:54.160]  donate button at infowarstore.com multiple times, $5, $10, $20, whatever you can afford. We appreciate
[24:54.160 --> 24:59.680]  it. And look, folks, we put it all on the line here. All right, we put it all on the line. That's
[24:59.680 --> 25:05.440]  just it. And I'm speaking not just for myself. I'll be the one in front of the camera and the
[25:05.440 --> 25:11.360]  microphone for the next two days. But don't forget about the great crew behind me,
[25:11.360 --> 25:19.840]  making it all possible. And so we've told you Bone Broth Plus back in stock. This has been

[26:20.800 --> 26:31.920]  Let's keep the mothership in orbit infowarstore.com. All right. Now, before I come back and
[26:31.920 --> 26:35.840]  really start to hammer into the important news, we're going to start with the news in Ukraine.
[26:36.960 --> 26:42.960]  We'll get to the economic news. We'll get to the vaccine news, the political news. It's all coming
[26:42.960 --> 26:50.400]  up today. But let's just quickly hit this story. And I did not see or hear this anywhere over the
[26:50.400 --> 26:56.640]  weekend or even this morning. And I was a little surprised considering that the egg shortage story
[26:56.640 --> 27:03.920]  did make some serious waves. Massive fire destroys commercial egg farm of top U.S.
[27:03.920 --> 27:11.600]  supplier amid widespread egg shortage. And it's being reported that at least 100,000 chickens
[27:11.600 --> 27:22.000]  died in the fire at Hillendale Farms in Basra, Connecticut. So hundreds of firefighters had
[27:22.000 --> 27:27.920]  to put it out. It was a serious fire. You're looking at some of the images of that on the screen now.
[27:30.320 --> 27:39.840]  So we've had dozens. Really, the numbers might be over 100 now. It's hard to keep up with, but
[27:39.840 --> 27:48.560]  definitely dozens of food processing plants or farms like this egg farm going up in flames
[27:48.560 --> 27:55.360]  and burning to the ground since Biden got into office. Is that just a coincidence or is there
[27:55.360 --> 28:02.400]  something else going on? Don't worry, the FBI is not looking into it. I repeat, the FBI is not
[28:03.280 --> 28:09.200]  looking into it. They're probably going through my electronic data right now as we speak. Not
[28:09.200 --> 28:15.760]  looking into the food processing plants, burning the egg farms, burning the pipelines being bombed.
[28:15.760 --> 28:18.640]  They're not interested in that. They got to go through my personal records because, you know,
[28:19.280 --> 28:25.120]  I tell the truth for a living. So you add that on top of the already
[28:27.600 --> 28:33.520]  problematic situation of the egg shortage. I'm sure it's all just a coincidence, though. I'm
[28:33.520 --> 28:38.400]  sure we're not under attack. I'm sure there's no nefarious activity here. No, no, nothing to see
[28:38.400 --> 28:45.840]  here. It's not the big box mainstream chicken feed changing their formula. Now the hens won't
[28:45.840 --> 28:50.800]  leg eggs and all the food processing plants and the egg farms being burned to the ground.
[28:50.800 --> 28:57.520]  Nothing to see here. Don't worry, the FBI is not looking into it. They are not looking into it.
[28:57.520 --> 29:09.360]  Died Force is amazing. I'm 45 and I have bits. I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.

[32:58.800 --> 33:07.280]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:15.600 --> 33:26.480]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host,
[33:26.480 --> 33:32.000]  Owen Troyer. Now I don't want to get ahead of myself but I want to kind of show you the
[33:32.000 --> 33:38.080]  constellation here because you think there'd be cause for concern with headlines like this.
[33:39.760 --> 33:45.280]  Third Hunter Biden email from laptop with classified information uncovered classified
[33:45.280 --> 33:52.640]  White House conference call shared with hunters Ukrainian business partners and several more
[33:52.640 --> 33:56.400]  are coming. So I'm not trying to get ahead of myself with the Biden crime family stories
[33:56.400 --> 34:03.120]  here but as I delve into the situation in Ukraine don't you think it's important
[34:05.200 --> 34:15.200]  don't you think it's important to know that the Biden crime family has business interests in Ukraine
[34:15.840 --> 34:20.000]  don't you think the American people would want to know that ahead of starting a war with Russia
[34:20.000 --> 34:27.360]  over Ukraine don't you think there's some pretty obvious questions that need to be asked and answered
[34:28.720 --> 34:34.160]  like is there a personal reason why Joe Biden wants to go to war in Ukraine with Russia
[34:34.160 --> 34:40.960]  is there a personal interest for Biden to have military action in Ukraine against Russia is
[34:40.960 --> 34:50.080]  Biden afraid that his business dealings may be exposed by Russia even kind of an important detail
[34:50.080 --> 34:57.280]  isn't it kind of something you think the American people would want to be interested in if Joe Biden
[34:57.280 --> 35:03.280]  doesn't have personal interests in Ukraine putting his own personal interest above that of the
[35:03.280 --> 35:10.800]  countries or rather even the worlds that's Joe and Hunter Biden with their business dealings in
[35:10.800 --> 35:19.360]  Ukraine most of which we already know that the mainstream media covered up and big pharma covered
[35:19.360 --> 35:29.920]  up so let's just keep that in mind the Biden crime family has personal business interests in Ukraine
[35:29.920 --> 35:37.680]  that is undeniable fact you think that might be weighing into the decisions Biden is making for
[35:37.680 --> 35:46.480]  that region wouldn't you like to know but so just keep that in mind as we go into the most recent
[35:46.480 --> 35:54.880]  developments out of Ukraine okay so what is the number I don't know 200 billion dollars that we've
[35:54.880 --> 36:03.520]  sent to Ukraine and again not to get off track but it's like every time I see liberals complaining
[36:03.520 --> 36:08.080]  about the economy or complaining there's not free money or free this or free that for whatever group
[36:08.080 --> 36:14.800]  they're virtue signaling for I just sit here and I just laugh because you won't say a damn thing about
[36:14.800 --> 36:19.680]  the money that's going to Ukraine 200 billion dollars you've supported every single dime that's
[36:19.680 --> 36:24.160]  gone to Ukraine and then you complain because Americans are getting it tough financially with
[36:24.160 --> 36:31.360]  the policies you voted for I mean this is this is completely insane behavior on display from the
[36:31.360 --> 36:39.360]  American left but okay so hundreds of billions of dollars and now tanks and weapons and ammunition
[36:39.360 --> 36:45.360]  and everything in Ukraine and they're still losing the war by the way I mean imagine if you're alone
[36:46.400 --> 36:51.440]  a bank loaning out money and you keep loaning money to this business or this individual who
[36:51.440 --> 36:55.680]  keeps losing money losing money losing money can never pay back the loan can never pay back the
[36:55.680 --> 36:59.760]  interest would you keep giving that money to him would you keep loaning that money well of course
[36:59.760 --> 37:10.560]  not so why do we keep giving money and weapons to Ukraine Zelenskyi requests more weapons and
[37:10.560 --> 37:19.440]  more money and he wants it faster that's last night that's last night yahoo news syndicating
[37:19.440 --> 37:25.600]  with the Associated Press and everybody else a Reuters story so again Zelenskyi comes here
[37:25.600 --> 37:30.640]  after getting 150 billion dollars and he says it's not enough we want more in front of the
[37:30.640 --> 37:36.720]  US Congress they give him more billions dollars more tanks and everything else and ammunition
[37:36.720 --> 37:42.560]  and weapons and then what is Zelenskyi's response not thank you his response is I need more and I
[37:42.560 --> 37:50.640]  need it faster right now what a selfish jerk how about no more for you how about you piss off
[37:50.640 --> 37:57.040]  you you little you little tyrant you little fascist you little Nazi how about you go piss off
[37:58.880 --> 38:05.120]  you want more money you want more weapons it'll never be enough what should we do should we just
[38:05.120 --> 38:10.080]  give Zelenskyi the entire landmass of the United States should we just give Zelenskyi the command
[38:10.080 --> 38:17.680]  and control of the United States military maybe he already has it don't ask Joe Biden he doesn't know
[38:19.600 --> 38:26.240]  what an absolute a-hole Vladimir Zelensky is if there was any doubt about the type of person
[38:26.240 --> 38:31.840]  he is well you can remove all that doubt now oh you guys are going through a tough situation
[38:31.840 --> 38:34.960]  there in Ukraine I'll tell you what here's hundreds of billions of dollars and here's
[38:34.960 --> 38:40.800]  some weapons it's been tough for you guys good luck no does he say thank you oh thank you so much
[38:40.800 --> 38:44.800]  you've saved so many people thank you so much you've kept us in this fight no he instead he says
[38:44.800 --> 38:50.400]  hey why don't you give me more and why don't you give me it faster what the hell's wrong with you
[38:50.400 --> 38:56.800]  you little punk Joe Biden ought to go over there and punch him in the mouth
[38:56.800 --> 39:09.920]  new rand report comes out urging Washington to get out of Ukraine avoiding a long war
[39:09.920 --> 39:14.640]  US policy in the trajectory of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and see this is why the military
[39:14.640 --> 39:20.240]  generals are realizing we go to war with Russia today we end up in war with China tomorrow
[39:20.240 --> 39:26.240]  and by the way we can't even recruit people to join our military because our government
[39:26.240 --> 39:31.040]  and our leaders are so corrupt so we don't even have the numbers we've given all of our weapons
[39:31.040 --> 39:38.080]  to Ukraine so we don't even have weapons anymore so it's not looking good and now 10% of the boys
[39:38.080 --> 39:43.520]  born in the United States end up chopping off their dinglings and becoming women maybe not a
[39:43.520 --> 39:47.280]  situation we'd like to be in not to mention our borders wide open and our president isn't
[39:47.280 --> 39:54.160]  incompetent moron and a compromised corrupt foreign agent boy we got him we got the swords
[39:54.160 --> 40:01.440]  pointed us don't we and again why do these foreign leaders keep making deals with Joe Biden thinking
[40:01.440 --> 40:07.680]  that he's going to be square german warns against arms race as Ukraine pushes for missiles and jets
[40:08.560 --> 40:15.520]  now let me explain some of the background here no countries in europe want to continue this
[40:15.520 --> 40:21.200]  support of Ukraine because they don't want to get into a war with Russia and they know Zelensky
[40:21.200 --> 40:29.920]  is a corrupt little punk but the United States basically funds all of NATO and funds all of
[40:29.920 --> 40:39.440]  this humanitarian bull crap that we can kind of boss Europe around so we fund NATO the european
[40:39.440 --> 40:48.160]  countries aren't funding NATO but they need NATO as they see it so the US can basically yank the
[40:48.160 --> 40:52.560]  chain and get Germany and these other countries to do whatever they want because we send all this
[40:52.560 --> 40:59.200]  money to NATO member trump tried to stop that well now we know why biden and the rest of the deep
[40:59.200 --> 41:04.400]  state love it so much because it gives them the leash over european countries with the NATO funding
[41:04.400 --> 41:08.960]  trump was like why are we paying for NATO this is ridiculous we don't even need it well now we
[41:08.960 --> 41:15.520]  know why we're paying for NATO it's just influence over europe is all it is we're just buying influence
[41:15.520 --> 41:23.600]  it doesn't benefit us at all so we finally get germany to send tanks but even that was like
[41:23.600 --> 41:29.840]  pulling hairs and so the agreement the unofficial agreement that was made between germany and the
[41:29.840 --> 41:36.560]  biden administration was all right we're going to send these tanks but we're done that's it
[41:36.560 --> 41:47.120]  it no more money no more artillery no more tanks no more troops no jets but look okay you've been
[41:47.120 --> 41:53.280]  begging for the tanks for months let's just this is it though and we're out here's the tanks
[41:54.080 --> 41:58.800]  we're out and we'll even give you the nice new tanks we'll give you the leopards and then germany's
[41:58.800 --> 42:05.120]  like all right and we're out okay oh oh you got deceived by joe biden you got deceived by the
[42:05.120 --> 42:11.840]  democrats you got deceived by the white house oops germany warns against arms race as ukraine
[42:11.840 --> 42:17.600]  pushes for missiles and jets german chancellor olof schultz who has been trying to stop this
[42:18.160 --> 42:23.280]  is warning against a race to arm ukraine with high-powered weapons as ukraine ramps up its call
[42:23.280 --> 42:28.560]  for fighter jets and long-range missiles so so schultz actually has a little bit of common sense
[42:28.560 --> 42:34.000]  and a little bit of concern here he's been the one rejecting the calls for tanks rejecting the calls
[42:34.000 --> 42:39.280]  for money rejecting the calls for weapons but the us yanked that chain of nato funding and said okay
[42:39.280 --> 42:44.480]  well we're not going to fund nato how about you pay for it so germany said fine fine we'll send you
[42:44.480 --> 42:48.880]  some leopard tanks but that's it we're done we're not going to be a part of this larger issue you're
[42:48.880 --> 42:54.160]  trying to create and then immediately after sending the tanks what happened zealinski asked for more
[42:54.160 --> 42:58.480]  weapons and biden told europe you need to give him more weapons now germany's like what the hell are
[42:58.480 --> 43:06.480]  you doing

[46:55.200 --> 46:56.320]  not taking action
[46:56.320 --> 47:18.320]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[47:18.320 --> 47:31.360]  you know they came out with this study suggesting that the world respects the united states more
[47:31.360 --> 47:39.440]  under joe biden than donald trump and to me that's just saving face because they know it's the exact
[47:39.440 --> 47:49.680]  opposite and you have this scene now biden's new russia ambassador lin tracy arrives at the russian
[47:49.680 --> 47:55.440]  foreign ministry for the first time greeted with chance of war is a us business in america is a
[47:55.440 --> 48:02.640]  terrorist country but oh yeah the world respects us so much more under joe biden yep trying to start
[48:02.640 --> 48:10.400]  world war three with russia uh-huh but again picking up where we left it off the rest of the world has
[48:10.400 --> 48:18.480]  had some bit of sanity when it comes to the situation in ukraine and not wanting to make it
[48:18.480 --> 48:26.320]  worse but then there's joe biden and the us continuing to throw fuel on that fire
[48:26.320 --> 48:33.200]  and so germany now is the latest to get stabbed in the back by joe biden
[48:35.520 --> 48:40.880]  the unofficial agreement when germans sent the tanks into ukraine or the agreement to
[48:40.880 --> 48:45.360]  send the tanks into ukraine i i guess they haven't been sent yet uh and when they do you'll hear
[48:45.360 --> 48:52.240]  about it because they're going to get blown up and so the agreement was though germany despite
[48:52.240 --> 48:59.440]  months and months of rejecting intervening even further into this war with weapons and tanks
[49:00.160 --> 49:03.680]  finally the biden administration twisted their arm certainly threatened to withhold
[49:03.680 --> 49:13.840]  nato funding which is just an empty bluff and got germany to agree to send the leper tanks to
[49:13.840 --> 49:22.720]  ukraine in which case they said this is it we're done we're done we'll send in the tanks we'll
[49:22.720 --> 49:29.440]  support this level and we're done stop asking us and so immediately upon agreeing to that deal what
[49:29.440 --> 49:38.400]  happened zalinsky asked for more and joe biden demanded more why would anybody trust joe biden
[49:38.400 --> 49:45.520]  biden they wouldn't nato chief presses south korea to provide arms to ukraine oh now it's
[49:45.520 --> 49:54.640]  everybody everybody better support ukraine that ain't gonna go so well that's not going to go so
[49:54.640 --> 50:03.920]  well now strategically south korea knows china is going to be their biggest issue dealing with north
[50:03.920 --> 50:15.200]  korea so strategically geopolitically they may want to scratch the us back in this case
[50:16.960 --> 50:22.560]  simply because they hope the us could scratch back should china ever get more aggressive with
[50:22.560 --> 50:30.800]  north korea in that region of the world but i don't even know if south korea will be so willing to
[50:30.800 --> 50:36.560]  get involved into this potential world war three situation joe biden wants so much some western
[50:36.560 --> 50:41.120]  backers of ukraine worry that time might be on russia's side that's the wall street journal
[50:41.120 --> 50:52.880]  oh no everything is on russia's side everything is on russia's side russia is the good guy in
[50:52.880 --> 51:03.120]  this situation russia is winning the war in ukraine ukraine is suffering massive loss
[51:04.400 --> 51:14.400]  infrastructure loss soldiers dying and they're so desperate to drum up more support of the war
[51:14.400 --> 51:23.360]  ukraine zalinsky is bombing his own people to blame russia and ask for more weapons that's how sick
[51:23.360 --> 51:29.360]  that maniac is and now the american media i was wondering when is the america when is the american
[51:29.360 --> 51:34.000]  media gonna realize everything they've said about ukraine is wrong maybe that time is now
[51:34.880 --> 51:38.880]  and that might save us from getting into world war three if biden didn't have the media support
[51:38.880 --> 51:45.200]  launching world war three then maybe he backs off russia warns the united states the end of nuclear
[51:45.200 --> 51:51.040]  arms control may be near and and what is that really saying it's saying what i've been saying all
[51:51.040 --> 51:57.600]  along the united states leadership role on the planet you know people make the joke of well
[51:57.600 --> 52:02.640]  we're the police of the world okay fine call it that america's role of police of the world which
[52:02.640 --> 52:12.400]  i don't support to be clear i don't like that role but that role which does demand and require the
[52:12.400 --> 52:21.280]  respect of the rest of the world whether it be good reasons or bad reasons those days are gone
[52:22.720 --> 52:27.200]  and so russia is basically saying to the us you're not going to tell iran whether they
[52:27.200 --> 52:34.160]  can have nuclear weapons or not i mean if you want to if you want the most rudimentary translation
[52:34.160 --> 52:40.080]  that's what it is now israel just struck iran israel is bombing iran so that situation is going on
[52:40.080 --> 52:46.960]  that in fact just happened this weekend israel bombed iran so russia is simply saying look
[52:46.960 --> 52:52.960]  you guys telling the world how to operate is done you no longer have the moral high ground you're
[52:52.960 --> 52:59.200]  not even economically the strongest country in the world anymore because ever since you elected
[52:59.200 --> 53:04.560]  joe biden you've been sliding down the scale in case you haven't noticed so this is the stuff the
[53:04.560 --> 53:10.960]  american media and our government is not telling you but the rest of the world is starting to
[53:10.960 --> 53:18.080]  realize and many americans perhaps starting to realize as well now i'm okay with that i don't
[53:18.080 --> 53:22.800]  want the us to be the police of the world i'd rather us fix our own country we got all kinds of
[53:22.800 --> 53:29.200]  problems here to which the left complains about all the time obviously but oh no no no we got to
[53:29.200 --> 53:34.400]  figure out the situation in ukraine we got to send money we got to send weapons and russia now with
[53:34.400 --> 53:40.880]  china and saudi arabia and iran brazil has now stabbed him in the back now that lula is in there
[53:42.160 --> 53:49.680]  but no it's the us and joe biden that lack the respect and lack the moral high ground
[53:49.680 --> 53:55.440]  and the rest of the world knows it now and they're done being at the behest
[53:57.440 --> 54:03.120]  of corrupt western leaders but but joe biden was the final straw joe biden the guy that poops his
[54:03.120 --> 54:10.560]  pants joe biden the guy that can't remember the lines can't properly read a teleprompter
[54:10.560 --> 54:14.960]  can't show up for meetings a lot of the times can't remember what he had for breakfast
[54:14.960 --> 54:20.320]  can't remember where or if he has classified documents that he stole from the white house
[54:21.840 --> 54:24.640]  and has all kinds of corrupt business dealings all around the planet
[54:26.560 --> 54:31.440]  so the rest of the world says you know what that's that's enough that's enough
[54:32.640 --> 54:36.240]  you know it's one thing with george bush maybe it's a whole other thing with brock obama and
[54:36.240 --> 54:40.480]  then there was trump and that was a positive thing but but now you put biden back in there
[54:40.480 --> 54:46.640]  just a total insult to the rest of the world so they're done so they're done
[54:48.960 --> 54:54.000]  and this doesn't have to be a good thing or it doesn't excuse me it doesn't have to be a bad
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.960]  thing this could be a good thing we could use this for good and we could say you know what
[54:57.760 --> 55:02.160]  if the rest of the world doesn't want us intervention anymore and us interference anymore
[55:03.280 --> 55:09.600]  we should we should say okay good that's fine let's go ahead and focus on our own country
[55:09.600 --> 55:16.560]  let's focus on our own problems let's focus on our own border let's focus on our own internal
[55:16.560 --> 55:22.400]  struggles here at home the world doesn't want us to be in the police anymore no problem let's
[55:22.400 --> 55:28.240]  go ahead and call it off let's retire it let's start saving our own country here
[55:30.880 --> 55:36.720]  but it's not going to go that way our deep state our corrupt military industrial complex
[55:36.720 --> 55:40.320]  is going to cling on to this for dear life and they're going to use the situation in Ukraine
[55:41.200 --> 55:47.200]  as the grapple if you will and the rest of the world just isn't having it folks
[55:49.120 --> 55:54.400]  so i don't know where it goes for us from here but
[55:57.040 --> 56:01.840]  the only hope we have at this point to not getting into a larger war with Russia is
[56:01.840 --> 56:07.520]  Sainer heads prevailing now i don't see anybody calling for a peace talk Zelensky's not interested
[56:07.520 --> 56:13.040]  in peace Biden's not interested in peace they want war with Russia they want nuclear war with
[56:13.040 --> 56:18.960]  Russia they want to kill Putin is what i really think is the case or somebody wants them to
[56:19.920 --> 56:24.000]  it's just total evil just just just complete nonsense
[56:27.520 --> 56:31.360]  but see this isn't going to be oh we're going to go kill Osama bin Laden or oh we're going to
[56:31.360 --> 56:37.760]  go kill Saddam Hussein or oh we're going to go kill the leader of Libya Gaddafi
[56:38.640 --> 56:40.400]  and then have Hillary Clinton laugh about it
[56:43.360 --> 56:46.080]  or George Bush say you're either with us or you're the terrorists
[56:46.640 --> 56:51.040]  no this isn't going to be that simple Russia is a serious respected world power
[56:51.040 --> 56:53.760]  Vladimir Putin is a serious respected world leader
[56:53.760 --> 57:04.880]  and Joe Biden is a bumbling old fool with a poopy diaper so yeah that's your situation
[57:04.880 --> 57:11.280]  and and by the way all the Ukrainians i have this video we'll play it later today on the
[57:11.280 --> 57:17.440]  war room how Ukrainian refugees are handling cultural integration in ethically diverse areas of the
[57:17.440 --> 57:26.640]  UK and the Ukrainians that fled were white are complaining there's too many black and brown
[57:26.640 --> 57:34.240]  kids at their schools oh probably too many gay flags too isn't that funny isn't that funny
[57:35.440 --> 57:44.080]  how that works yeah not all is as it seems the entitlement though that's that's definitely
[57:44.080 --> 57:52.320]  as it seems the arrogance definitely as it seems well i did fantastic serve diet force

[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:32.320]  they've officially become state-run apple 100 google is now making the transition and
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:38.080]  announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship they are now beta testing using me as the straw
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:42.720]  man a demonized version of alex jones to do that this is happening this is not like the other
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:47.520]  probes before that we're meant to get used to probes and censorship thinking you would adapt
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:53.120]  to censorship by just putting up with it now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:58.960]  of times the magnitude of all previous attacks this is a tight-treated dose reverse psychological
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:05.440]  warfare operation using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation in layman's
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:10.080]  terms they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed we adapt to being pressed with
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:16.880]  the low dosages of oppression now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover we try to adapt to
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:23.280]  the poison infusion instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose total

[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:34.000]  virtual reality ai weapon system now attacking the united states with traders inside the major
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:39.120]  security agencies blocking trumps resistance of the program and attempting to stop us from removing
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:44.160]  the tentacles of the chai com slash big tech making combine emergency situation i have been
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:48.320]  chosen for destruction because i brought you this information and have been battering ramming it out
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:54.800]  as much as i can they want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:02:00.320]  deception where every angle of my good is turned against us so they take what i've said being
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:05.600]  sincere built me into an insincere person in the straw man i'm a person that cares about life and
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:10.160]  children and is against these wars and so they make me a herder of children and then they build me
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:15.280]  into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:21.120]  debate about alex jones so even if i didn't sell out to them they've now used me as an archetype
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:27.200]  to serve them by being the main distraction i have now been captured by the enemy in the
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:32.000]  information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you only your full understanding of this
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:38.160]  key will break you free from this paradigm i have given you the transmission now break free
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:49.360]  i have sworn upon the altar of god eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:57.920]  mind of man thomas jefferson if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:06.000]  all right ladies and gentlemen uh dealing with some uh stuff here off the air and uh i hope i'll
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.760]  be able to explain exactly what that is before the end of the show today and i kind of want to do a
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:18.640]  deep tease here because what you're gonna see probably by the end of the day today i'm hoping
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:26.000]  as i'm hosting double duty today just like i was on friday and so you know there's a problem when
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:34.240]  you spend seven hours on the air and you read uh 60 news headlines and so what you're going to see
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:39.920]  i'm hoping by the end of the day is the difference between info wars and the corrupt news media
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:47.520]  where and and and see this is this is the other difference between legitimate people out there
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:53.600]  where if you make a mistake what's supposed to happen is they call and they demand a retraction
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:58.800]  and then you get the opportunity to issue that retraction instead of getting sued for three
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:06.720]  trillion dollars where in those cases we're never asked for a retraction for the 10 years
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:13.440]  in between statements being made and us ending up in court never once was a retraction offered
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:19.600]  or requested would have simply been accepted if a retraction would have been offered or requested
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:24.640]  but no they wanted to sue us for trillions of dollars instead so it wasn't really about the
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:30.960]  information so hopefully because i will tell you like i said when you're on air seven hours a day
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:36.640]  and you've got 30 stacks of news in front of you and sometimes you're just picking up headlines and
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:40.480]  reading it and you missay something you might make a mistake so somebody called and said hey you
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:46.160]  made a mistake on this can you offer a retraction and i said i have no problem not only will i offer
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:53.360]  the retraction i want you to come on air and even tell us the truth see that's how we operate here
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:56.880]  but all the people that lied to you about the vaccines killing you are they ever gonna do that
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:05.680]  i doubt it i talk a lot about the great successes info wars this had i don't think anybody can
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:11.600]  deny it and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us when we talk about the
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:17.520]  crew at info wars people behind the scenes the researchers the writers they really have been
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:22.720]  the mvps in this fight and we look at herons and smith and oh and shroyer and the hard work they
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:29.520]  engage in every day five six seven days a week it's really just incredible so for myself the whole
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:35.280]  info wars crew i thank you for your past support i only encourage you now to realize that info wars
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:39.760]  cannot stay on air if you do not support us i know you spread the word i know you pray for us
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:43.920]  and that's wonderful keep doing it but most viewers and listeners never go to info wars

[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:52.080]  highlight another good thing from kevin mccarthy and i mean if i'm being generous if i'm being
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:59.760]  generous i'd say i'll give mccarthy till march to start to start walking the walk i'll give mccarthy
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:05.600]  till march to start walking the walk he's talking the talk and as somebody who is one of his biggest
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:14.960]  naysayers during the speaker's race i like what i've seen so far and i'm willing to give him till
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:20.800]  march to start walking the walk but there's no doubt he's talking the talk and there's no doubt
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:28.560]  there's already been an attitude and approach change to the republican party since he's become
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:34.880]  the speaker remember you had the george santos situation and that's one issue where whatever
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:41.680]  you think about santos i think there's a lot of weirdness there definitely um to say the least of
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:48.400]  it but it should be up to the people of new york they voted for him that's their issue and mccarthy
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:53.120]  has said that and now we've got another instance and i'm going to explain why this is a good thing
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:10:00.240]  coming from kevin mccarthy here's ilhan omar now ilhan omar because of her skin color and her her
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:05.360]  head dress and that she's a woman and an immigrant and everything else and maybe she's gay or i don't
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:11.840]  you know who knows she's been able to pull all kinds of political leverage and media leverage
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:17.520]  simply because of her skin color and her headdress well mccarthy ain't playing these games and so
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:22.720]  she's complaining about it here she is complaining about this on twitter and and let's see if you
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:28.960]  catch let's see if you catch the big tell here here's ilhan omar kevin mccarthy did nothing when
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:34.240]  marjorie taylor green said muslims don't belong in our government that's not what she said he
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:39.920]  did nothing when bobert said i was a terrorist again out of contact he did nothing when marjorie
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:45.680]  taylor green wanted reshita to leave and i kicked out of congress unless we swore in on a christian
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:54.160]  bible oh you don't like that spare me the g.o.p hypocrisy now let me just go on with the insanity
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:59.120]  for milhan omar before i tell you the good news from mccarthy here i mean how this woman is not
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:04.080]  sued for for libel or slander not just for the lies about marjorie taylor green and bobert but
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:10.720]  now trump now she says trump dined with nazis uh i don't remember trump dining with zelenski
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:19.040]  said jews have to get their act together and said that to a group of jewish leaders uh ilan
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:22.480]  omar what about your comments towards israel and the jews and you're going to point the finger at
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:28.480]  trump hilarious kevin mccarthy himself accused jewish donors of trying to buy elections he never
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:35.840]  apologized oh i ilan you were you're the anti-semite here she goes on kevin mccarthy is following a
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:41.760]  well-worn playbook pit minority groups against each other in order to further marginalize them no that's
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:47.280]  the democrat playbook but uh okay it has been used by demagogues throughout history and it won't
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:52.960]  work we will continue to out organize not work to hate so a bunch of just word vomit there a little
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:12:02.240]  word soup salad now okay what is the takeaway here do you see the bigger picture here let me let me
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:07.200]  bring it back to a statement at the beginning or let me just let let me let me read a couple
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:13.440]  statements and see if you pick up what i'm putting down from ilan omar kevin mccarthy did nothing when
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:21.200]  margaret taylor green said muslims don't belong in government kevin mccarthy accused jewish
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:27.920]  donors of trying to buy elections he never apologized she says it again he never apologized he says it
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:34.080]  twice oh three times actually three times in this tweet she says he never apologized are you starting
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:43.200]  to get it you see democrats like ilhan omar have been used to running the republican party
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:50.160]  when they complain when they lie when they libel and they slander when they twist when they take
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:56.560]  out a context when they accuse that's their methodology of controlling the republican party
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:02.000]  oh you're racist oh you're xenophobic oh you're homophobic oh you're transphobic and what do
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.880]  they get they get republicans to apologize and they get republicans to fight one another
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:11.280]  and here's ilhan omar complaining about how that's not kevin mccarthy
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:18.560]  so i say that to win for kevin mccarthy because the democrats aren't running him
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:29.680]  and this has them furious they are furious that they can't control kevin mccarthy with
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:36.560]  the threats and the libel and the slander you better apologize you better kick these republicans
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:44.400]  off committees you better get rid of george santos and what does mccarthy say nothing because he
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:52.400]  doesn't have to and he shouldn't that's a huge win folks and and i understand that all things
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:14:02.400]  considered it's like a like a a pebble in a in a room full of boulders but snacks to finally have
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:09.040]  some pebbles so kevin mccarthy has pebbles might not have boulders yet but he's got some pebbles
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:16.880]  i'll take it i'll take kevin mccarthy with pebbles over a republican speaker of the house with
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:24.400]  nothing so yeah democrats are pissed because they can't force kevin mccarthy to apologize
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:29.680]  and they can't force kevin mccarthy to enact democrat party policy or agendas getting republicans
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:34.560]  off committees or or causing infighting in the republican party making others apologize
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:40.800]  so that's good news right there democrats are pissed they don't control kevin mccarthy
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:49.600]  because that's what they're used to rafael warlock buys 1.1 million dollar dc home
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:55.040]  as allegations of church sanctions evictions resurface oh he's you know this guy's honestly
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:59.840]  one of the biggest scumbags in the country there really is something to be said about posing as
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:05.680]  a religious leader and then fleecing your congregation for millions of dollars fleecing the people
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:11.360]  renting your units and evicting them and then running over your wife with your car but that's
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:17.120]  another situation and the democrats just love this guy they love criminals they they truly do and
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:23.440]  and some of them are such cold hard liars now even cnn is calling them out like adam schiff cnn's
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:30.800]  dana bass calls adam schiff out for being a liar because he said during congressional hearings
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:34.960]  that he had proof that trump colluded with russia he never provided the truth so some of the people
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:40.880]  that see and enter like hey listen dickhead you told us you had information and proof of it
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:45.920]  that trump colluded with russia we reported on that for four years you lied you never gave us this
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:52.880]  you're a liar and so what did schiff say no no no no i do have the evidence i do have the information
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:16:02.400]  so he lied again maybe even cnn hosts will figure it out the cavalry has arrived ultimate bone broth

[01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:25.280]  now i had already moved on from the ukraine news but the situation is so serious now there's
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:30.800]  developing and breaking news on that as i'm sitting here so we're gonna have to go back
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:34.400]  into that issue i'm gonna put it off though another segment or two because i do have other news to
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:42.400]  cover but pretty pretty shocking disturbing stuff coming there meanwhile though third hunter biden
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:47.200]  email from lab top with classified information uncovered classified white house conference
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:53.920]  calls shared with hunters ukrainian business partners and several more are coming yeah it's
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:21:01.680]  it's all well known and it's really just a matter of if anybody has the will to do a real investigation
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:07.280]  and criminal charges against the biden crime family is joe biden above the law or not that's
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:13.520]  the real question and so this is a follow-up to a story the gateway pundit had published last night
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:19.760]  second hunter biden email from lab top with classified information uncovered and so it's
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:23.760]  just the the bidens are so corrupt they're foreign agents they're illegal foreign agents
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:28.800]  they're selling classified documents they're selling us sensitive intel and information
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:34.960]  information to the highest bidder and they are pulling out of afghanistan for china
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:42.800]  leaving us citizens over there leaving our allies over there stranded it's just it's so bad it's so
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:49.280]  bad in fact you know what says i'm on this now guys pull up the story i forget where it was
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:56.800]  you had it on the screen earlier clinton it was clinton campaign team or whatever says
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:02.080]  that new biden documents will bring him down i forget what the headline was but but the reason
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:06.640]  why this is so significant and most of the people won't recall this or see the bigger picture
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:14.720]  but we've talked about it many times why would the clinton campaign be coming out and telling you
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:19.760]  that the biden documents are real and that it's bad enough to bring down the biden crime family
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:24.720]  well is this hillary clinton preparing for another presidential run don't necessarily
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:30.880]  count that out but that's not what this is really about why would clinton aides
[01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:35.600]  why would clinton aides be coming out and warning you
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:44.160]  that the biden documents are so bad that it could end his chances in 2024
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:52.240]  because ladies and gentlemen the original opposition research into joe biden was done
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:23:02.640]  by the clinton campaign and they wrote in the new york times in 2015 a hit piece
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:10.800]  colluding with hillary clinton's campaign team on opposition research into joe biden
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:15.600]  with a veiled threat it wasn't the revelation it was the threat of the revelation
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:22.800]  basically hillary clinton's campaign threatening joe biden through the new york times saying hey bud
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:28.880]  we've done the opposition research into you and your son hunter
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:33.520]  and we know about all your corrupt business dealings in ukraine and if you don't bow out
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:39.440]  of the race now so that hillary can win we will publish it and you will go down
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:48.560]  well that was in 2015 and so there's no doubt hillary clinton is still bitter that the level
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:53.520]  of cheating they engaged in to get biden into the office was tenfold what they did for her
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:59.600]  she's extremely bitter about that to this day so she might have a little bit of her own
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:07.280]  saltiness to get biden out of there or expose the biden crime family she could be operating
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:11.360]  in good faith with the corrupt democrat party that's protected her for so long to help them get
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:15.840]  biden out but just understand and guys you had the story on the screen earlier if you can't
[01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:20.000]  find it it's fine but i don't know where it was but it was basically the clinton campaign saying
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:25.360]  nope the biden situation is so bad that it's probably gonna stop him from running in 2024
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:30.320]  well why would the clintons know that because they did the opposition research in 2015 they
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:38.720]  knew about joe biden as a corrupt foreign agent years ago everybody knew
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:47.920]  there it is x clinton advisor biden's classified file scandal will knock him out of the race in
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:53.760]  2024 over sun hunters big ukraine bribery scandal now why would the clinton visors be saying that
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:25:00.160]  because they already knew it they knew it all along in fact i wouldn't be surprised if clinton is the
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:08.560]  one that got ron clain in there and now he's out to make the situation worse for biden
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:19.360]  so that's what's going on there but now imagine the new york times is running this story today
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:28.160]  as if this is the big story trump golf courses will host three tournaments for saudi backed live
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:37.760]  golf and so this is the big story look donald trump his golf courses host a saudi arabian
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:47.920]  golf tournament in fact three of them now my god donald trump is corrupt we've caught him
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:53.200]  he's hosting saudi backed golf tournaments we've caught him like that's the big story like oh
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:58.640]  trump saudi arabia oh my gosh trump golf tournaments oh my gosh the live tour oh my gosh trump golf
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:07.680]  courses like that's the big conspiracy that's the big corruption story joe biden dealing with china
[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:14.720]  joe biden dealing with albania joe biden dealing with everybody else ukraine you name it nah
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:21.920]  nah trump hosting a golf tournament that's the one that's the corruption we're covering at the new
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:28.400]  york times joe biden stealing secret documents from the white house multiple times putting them
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:34.080]  in multiple different offices including offices that directly deal with chinese influence and
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:40.640]  millions of dollars coming in and the new york times not interested but trump having a golf
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:46.720]  tournament of a saudi backed golf league oh my gosh oh this is the one for them
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:55.440]  um senator ted cruz says fbi should search hunter biden's home for classified documents
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:03.680]  you know what else do you think they'd find maybe some dead hookers dead last ride in with biden
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:10.160]  comes in last place at 2023 pegasus world cup at golf stream park and it wasn't even close actually
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:17.360]  yeah um naming your horse after biden is probably setting yourself up for a loss
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:26.160]  and then you had fake dr jill biden attending the nfc championship game in the commissioner's box
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:32.800]  with roger godel she was put on the big screen at the philadelphia eagles game and uh there might
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:39.920]  be a lot of eagles fans tuned in today i know there's one on the staff and um at risk of angering you
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:45.360]  i will tell you that philadelphia eagles fans are some of the most obnoxious and
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:53.600]  intolerable sports fans on the planet it's well known but this one they got right so a
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:58.800]  little bonus for you it's like yeah i can't stand you but you know what you still boo jill biden
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:04.080]  and so you got that one right you got that one right i don't know was that from when they won
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:08.880]  the super bowl or is that from them celebrating the game last night oh even last night they're
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:13.600]  riding it wasn't even a super bowl in their riding i'm telling you look i look i love you i love
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:19.920]  you sports fans but philadelphia eagles fans you guys are seriously there's something wrong with
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:25.520]  y'all i don't know what they put in the water there at the link but uh at least you boo jill biden
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:30.800]  you booed santa but you booed you booed jill biden and so that gives you that gives you a gold star
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:36.800]  for me but it doesn't even matter wherever jill or jill biden go they get booed college football
[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:42.320]  game nfl football game nas car they put their picture on the image of a baseball game they get booed
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:48.880]  most popular president of all time and he's doing such great work for the economy isn't he right
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.600]  well it's amazing because the democrats claim he's the best president for the economy but

[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:04.400]  and do man on the street interviews and own the liberals and there's all kinds of footage
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:07.520]  that you may still be able to find out there most of it's been totally banned
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:15.760]  but we created a new genre really that day of street content of just going out and owning the
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:22.160]  libs now i'm unable to do that now due to legal situations and other threats and stuff and i
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:28.960]  basically need a whole security team when i go out now but the meme lives on aides skrillex
[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:35.520]  carl the cuck and then the screaming banshee of a woman just look up aides skrillex and you may
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:39.760]  or carl the cuck and you may still be able to find that original video from a trump rally
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:47.440]  in 2016 where we created a new genre here but being used for different purposes now we voted
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:55.200]  to raise taxes on property owners not renters why did our rent go up only a liberal wouldn't
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:59.920]  understand the answer to that question but there's all kinds of evidence that this is exactly
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:08.960]  how they feel they're confused like nina turner now i don't know if nina turner has been to the
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:14.560]  white house like so many of these other paid for democrat accounts on twitter that get forced into
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:18.720]  your news feed you never follow any of these people but you constantly see their tweets it's
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:22.640]  because it's paid for democrat party propaganda that they force into your news feed now i don't
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:26.720]  know if that's nina turner it's because i haven't seen her at the white house like i have the others
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:34.480]  that literally go to the white house to get their orders um but she fits right into that
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:40.640]  category with tweets like this people can't afford a rent people can't afford food people
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:48.640]  can't afford the doctor our current economic system is unacceptable period well first of all um
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:54.640]  that's always going to be the case so there's really nothing you can do about that phenomenon
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:36:04.000]  but what's ironic is all i hear out of the white house all i heard out of gen sake and all i hear
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:09.360]  out of korean gene pierre and all i hear out of kamala harris and joe biden is how great the economy
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:19.760]  is all day long they're promoting how great joe biden has been for the economy so so why this it's
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:23.840]  amazing isn't it how democrats can talk out of both sides of their mouth democrats can have their
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:31.920]  cake and eat it too so under joe biden it's the greatest economy ever but also under joe biden
[01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:36.800]  it's the worst economy ever well how does that make sense well you have to think about it from the
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:41.360]  liberal logic they want to be able to complain about things so that they can
[01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:52.560]  have the phenomenon of bigger government supposedly as the fix of the problems as the
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:37:02.160]  way to remedy these issues is more government so but they also got to tell you they're the
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:07.600]  greatest people on earth so it's the best economy under joe biden but also the economy is in real
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:11.840]  dire straits so we need more government to fix it and then here's the government fixing it joe
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:16.320]  biden look it's the greatest economy ever and then it's the worst economy ever we need help fixing
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:20.000]  it so you see this they talk out of both sides of their mouth they have their cake and eat it too
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:25.760]  it's just another example but what's the reality of the situation the reality is that nina turner is
[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:31.280]  right and that the american economy is devastated under joe biden now she's a good democrat
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:36.160]  propagandist so she's not going to put that two and two together they can't be fully honest
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:40.160]  so they lie to you and they promote joe biden saying it's the greatest economy ever
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:47.120]  but then they actually admit how bad the economy is hoping they can solve that problem with more
[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:55.680]  government intervention in your life but here's the real situation downhill disaster hard times
[01:37:55.680 --> 01:38:01.600]  these are actual quotes in this poll under joe biden 71 percent of americans say country is
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:06.640]  on the wrong track but joe biden said it's the greatest economy ever thanks to him
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:13.040]  huh and they keep bragging about the inflation reduction act that they passed but it hasn't
[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:21.200]  stopped any inflation hasn't helped the economy at all like debbie stabina this woman looks like
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:29.200]  she's been off her meds for a while or maybe on them democrats passed the inflation reduction act
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:34.800]  to lower costs for american families what's the house republicans plan a 30 percent national
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:41.840]  sales tax none of this is even none of this is honest none of it but but just cut through the
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:49.440]  noise of it all and what is the signal they tell you the economy is better than ever under joe
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:54.560]  biden and then they go out and they make speeches on the floors of congress telling you how bad the
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:39:01.520]  economy is again i mean how are they able to talk out of both sides of their mouth like this well
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:06.880]  because they're dishonest people one and two they've never been properly held accountable for their
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:16.720]  lies and disinformation because they continue to stay in power this really i think sums it up
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:23.920]  though i think that this might be where we're at and it gives you a good idea even on 100 000 plus
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:28.240]  annual salary more americans are living paycheck to paycheck
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:38.400]  and many people tuned in are probably understanding that exactly and it wasn't too long ago
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:46.800]  where most of the country if you were making 50 000 a year you were at least comfortable knowing
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:49.920]  that you were going to be able to afford your rent and you were not going to have an empty
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:54.080]  refrigerator when you came home and you were going to be able to put gas in your car to go to work
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:40:02.720]  now that's like 100 000 is that mile marker now 100 000 is that mile marker of knowing you can
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:07.680]  afford your rent you can afford the car payments your energy bills everything else 50 000 isn't
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:12.160]  enough you make 50 000 you might be looking to get another job now that's the joe biden economy
[01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:15.760]  which he says is doing great by the way so democrats tell you the joe biden economy is
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:19.440]  doing great and then democrats tell you how bad the economy is because you need to be making
[01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:24.960]  more than 100 000 a year just to afford to live which which democrat opinion should be trust
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:31.040]  the correct answer is none of them it's the perfect storm more americans can't afford their car
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:36.480]  payments than during the peak of the financial crisis for over a year we have been dutifully
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:41.520]  tracking several key data sets within the auto sector to find the critical inflection point
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:45.200]  in this perhaps most leading of the economic indicators which will
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:51.760]  presage not only a crushing auto loan crisis but also signal the arrival of a full-blown recession
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:41:00.080]  it's going to be a depression i've been saying it one which even the nber won't be able to ignore
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:04.960]  as the u.s consumers are once again tapped out a month ago we said that in our view the moment
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:10.160]  has now arrived the latest the latest data from fitch confirms as much now folks you have to understand
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:14.960]  it's not just the car payments it's just with car payments that's usually the first thing people
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:19.600]  stop paying because you get your car repossessed whatever it's it's not the worst thing you're
[01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:24.800]  going to deal with people will make their house payments they'll make their mortgage payments
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:31.280]  first they'll try to pay off other debts first uh but but there's metrics here like people are
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:36.720]  behind in rent at record levels people are behind in mortgages at record levels not seen since
[01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:40.800]  obama got elected and now people are behind in car payments not seen since obama got elected
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:45.200]  so we haven't seen an economic disaster since the last time a democrat got elected now we're
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:50.800]  seeing it again still can't figure out what's wrong though huh of course it's not just the
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:56.640]  democrat party let's be perfectly fair there's many other issues here banks brace for more
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:42:04.000]  consumers to fall behind on their loans wall street journal stocks are poised to hit new
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:11.680]  lows this year investors say renewable power projects slow in the united states over high
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:20.640]  costs and community opposition oh i love this one i love this one this story shows you how
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:28.000]  liberal democrats quite literally lack the ability of what should we call it second tier
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.960]  thinking multi-dimensional thinking they can't they can't think any moves ahead all they can
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:42.080]  see is one move ahead oh i saw i saw a plastic waste in the ocean we need to we need to save
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:49.520]  the planet oh i saw a report on the co2 emissions killing the planet we need to stop driving cars
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:55.040]  we need to stop natural gas but what does that really mean we need to fund the police let's

[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:38.400]  liberal democrat party policy seriously but you should also be extremely skeptical of whatever
[01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:45.200]  it is they are promoting and I've got a couple different examples of this today here's the
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:54.720]  headline from the zero hedge article which is just I think a republish of the epoch times
[01:47:54.720 --> 01:48:01.520]  times renewable power projects slow in the US over high costs and community opposition
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:07.040]  and this isn't just the high cost of your energy bills doubling and tripling this is
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:11.120]  the high cost of actually getting the quote unquote renewable or green energies
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:14.960]  which of course then leads to the high cost of everything else
[01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:24.880]  so there's two here's two examples of leftist liberal democrat policy
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:32.400]  that will destroy us that they can't really think further down the line and you know
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:38.720]  maybe I should get into this we've got an in studio guest coming up next hour
[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:46.000]  leon macadoo and there's something here folks there really is something here to draw back
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:51.200]  from the politics for a second and get into the psychology of it there really is something
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:57.600]  again just try to not think politics for a second there are certain people whose brains and minds
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:04.560]  we all don't work the same and we're learning more about this are the visual aspects of our minds
[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:11.440]  the cognitive aspects of our minds the retentative aspects of our minds and we're learning we're
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:20.960]  starting to learn more and more that not just do people perhaps look different but our brains
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:26.240]  act different our minds are not the same two people's minds do not act the same and we got
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:32.400]  more and more studies suggesting such and this to me is the perfect example now any thinking
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:39.520]  person anybody who can think or see more than one move ahead like in a game of chess understands
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:44.720]  this but if if you can't think or see one move ahead which some people just can't folks their
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:51.760]  brain is just not wired that way or they just have a dumb brain all jokes aside but I mean
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:56.080]  it's kind of serious maybe it's a joke maybe it's serious but seems like liberals are the ones that
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:02.960]  their brains don't work well so if you're playing a game of chess and you can't see hell even a game
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:11.200]  of checkers and you can't see more than one move ahead you're going to lose if you can't see more
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:16.000]  than one move ahead in a game of chess or a game of checkers you're never going to win and you're
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:21.600]  going to constantly be confused saying why can't I win oh oops I just got set up for a triple jump
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:27.840]  oh oops I just got set up now I've been put in checkmate because they literally cannot see
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:38.000]  two moves ahead they literally they literally do not have the brain function to see more than two
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:44.880]  moves ahead and it does require some high IQ it doesn't it does require some high intelligence
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:49.520]  to a certain level to be able to see something in the future to be able to see something that
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:57.520]  doesn't exist in front of you so there is I mean you are superhuman so but there is something special
[01:50:57.520 --> 01:51:02.320]  there there is something that is an ability now you start getting three four five moves ahead now
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:08.720]  you're talking serious IQ serious high IQs serious high intelligence levels but we're talking about
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:20.720]  liberals leftists and democrats who literally can't even see one move ahead not one not one now why am
[01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:25.680]  I emphasizing this because now let's apply it to politics and let's show two examples of this
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:32.800]  let's start with climate change and the carbon neutral agenda now bill gates and the rest of them
[01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:39.200]  they are smart they know the whole thing is a fraud they're using it to enslave maim and destroy
[01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:44.720]  and conquer humanity the average liberal whose brain doesn't work very well they literally
[01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:49.840]  can't see one move ahead the average democrat that supports these kind of policies can't see one move
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:59.040]  ahead that's why they're stunned oh why is my electricity bill going up why is the price
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:04.800]  at the pump going up why is my gas bill going up why are my grocery bills going up it's like
[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:10.320]  how did I get in checkmate how did I get jumped in checkers what you can't see one move ahead
[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:14.400]  you didn't know when you moved your checkers piece forward that that guy was going to jump you
[01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:18.480]  you didn't know when you moved your pond forward that the bishop was going to move you into checkmate
[01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:24.320]  you couldn't see that no they couldn't see that you couldn't see when you shut off us gas pipelines
[01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:31.920]  gas prices would go up you couldn't see when you shut off coal that energy prices would go up
[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:38.960]  you couldn't see that by eliminating this access to clean cheap energy your energy bills and the
[01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:46.320]  cost of living would go up you couldn't see that no they literally can't their brain doesn't work
[01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:58.000]  like yours it's not a very good brain so they're stunned they're just stunned oh you have to get
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:05.040]  a new car battery fifteen thousand dollars what you mean my car battery isn't gonna last forever
[01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:13.680]  and then oh you crunch the numbers the electric car oh you're saving money on gas oops by that
[01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:19.840]  second electric car battery you've just nullified every dollar you thought you saved so unless you
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:24.560]  want to buy a new electric vehicle every five to ten years you're not saving any money on gas
[01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:33.600]  but it's the same thing they think oh this is just sounds great this looks great let's stop coal
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:40.400]  let's stop gas hey what happened my gas at the pump price went up hey what happened my electricity
[01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:44.880]  bill went up hey what happened my grocery bill went up how did this happen i have no idea
[01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:50.640]  hey i moved my pawn and opened up my king how did i get into checkmate hey i moved my chest piece
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:58.320]  forward to the board i got double jumped in king how did this happen they literally cannot see
[01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:04.800]  one move ahead let alone two three four five like super intelligent people might be able to see
[01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:10.800]  they can't see one and that's why they support this crap that they don't understand
[01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:18.880]  renewable power projects slow in the united states over high costs and community opposition yeah
[01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:23.280]  pretty quickly when they're paying price of the pump is back up by the way today as well
[01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:28.880]  why four dollars per gallon gas may return may return soon it's already up here in texas
[01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:34.240]  it's up nationwide why did my gas prices go up all i did was shut down gas
[01:54:34.240 --> 01:54:37.920]  all i did was shut down the pipelines why did my gas prices go up i don't get it
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:45.600]  oh you must be a liberal they do not get it they cannot think a move ahead
[01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:54.560]  here's another one defund the police they can't think these things out to the conclusion folks
[01:54:54.560 --> 01:55:00.640]  that's the problem they i'm not this is a call it a mental illness or just some people's brains
[01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:06.960]  are built differently they cannot work things out to a logical conclusion they can't crush the numbers
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:11.840]  they literally can't even see it in their minds eye they might not even be able to have a visual
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:17.920]  mind we're actually learning now in studies some people do not have a visual mind some people don't
[01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:22.720]  even they can't even think but i'm not trying to get off on all these new psych psychological
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:26.160]  studies that are coming out i'm just telling you what's out there we're learning more and more
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:32.480]  about the human brain most of it's still a mystery but some people literally cannot see things in their
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:38.400]  mind they cannot think more than one move ahead they literally cannot do it now maybe there's
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:43.040]  some brain damage there or it's the fluoride and maybe they can train their brain and help it and
[01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:51.200]  grow it but as it stands they can't liberals can't and it yes it is liberals here's another one
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:58.080]  and we're seeing this all over last week and this weekend we have to defund the police we have to
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:03.200]  abolish the police we have to get rid of the police you clearly haven't reached the conclusion to
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:09.680]  that process have you how does that go either two things happen when you abolish the police
[01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:17.520]  one you have a lawless society or essentially anarchy now i'm not i'm not really an anarchist
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:22.560]  but i'm all for limited government and you know what is funny about that i'm the one that gets
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:26.640]  politically persecuted i'm the one that gets arrested for my politics you want to defund the
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:33.200]  police fine i'll finally be free how are you leftist and liberals and democrats going to arrest
[01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:39.360]  no insurer how are you leftist and liberals and democrats gonna charge an arrest no insurer when
[01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:43.600]  he does stuff you don't like without police i guess you haven't thought of that one have you
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:49.040]  oh i guess i guess so insurers are supposed to walk into his jail cell and just cuff himself
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:55.840]  and just die in there i guess that's what they expect no you abolish the police you're asking
[01:56:55.840 --> 01:57:04.800]  for either a lawless society or a militarization of the streets that's the only two paths abolishing
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:12.720]  the police go and and i don't think they realize the fine thin blue line that holds civilization
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:18.160]  and society together which is the police now see the globalists understand this the globalists
[01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:22.240]  understand this the democrats don't their brains don't work well the globalists do that's why they
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:29.200]  want to abolish the police to see america go into chaos but so these are two examples of how the left
[01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:34.400]  pushes for policies and agendas that they themselves don't understand and that they themselves
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:40.560]  literally cannot think out to their logical conclusion so go ahead abolish the police
[01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:44.640]  how are you going to arrest your political dissidents how are you going to enforce your
[01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:52.640]  vaccine mandates and everything else you love so much the cavalry has arrived ultimate bone broth

[01:59:53.680 --> 02:00:04.000]  transmission you are the resistance in 2003 the cia released a classified document with the
[02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:11.760]  subject heading analysis and assessment of gateway process a process that utilizes audio frequencies
[02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:18.960]  to achieve brain hemisphere synchronization in order to provide a thorough evaluation the document
[02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:27.280]  covers the techniques of hypnosis biofeedback and transcendental meditation thereby providing a
[02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:34.400]  modern scientific account of an ancient guarded knowledge of mankind's spiritual potential a
[02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:41.360]  potential that could save humanity from the mind control tactics being used to divide and enslave
[02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:50.240]  us the left brain is the mind's verbal and linear reasoning component it categorizes and assigns
[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:57.040]  meaning to incoming stimuli and passes this resulting information to the right brain which is
[02:00:57.040 --> 02:01:04.160]  non-critical and accepts whatever information it is given without question the left brain is the
[02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:11.840]  ego mind it operates on autopilot and can be easily swayed by external stimuli most of us are
[02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:18.960]  unaware of this because we naturally tend to identify ourselves with the ego we think that the
[02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:27.120]  ego is who we are but in fact it is just a part of our mental processing the right brain is our
[02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:34.560]  subconscious mind and hypnosis is a technique of directly accessing the subconscious by disengaging
[02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:42.720]  the ego giving us self-awareness and control over the subconscious mind transcendental meditation
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:48.960]  achieves this by practicing single-minded concentration of drawing energy up from the base
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:56.080]  of the spinal cord and into the brain with practice this visual concentration eventually
[02:01:56.080 --> 02:02:03.840]  polarizes the cortex bringing both hemispheres into balance allowing the individual to transcend
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:11.360]  the ego mind with biofeedback rather than suppressing the left brain as done with hypnosis
[02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:19.280]  or ignoring it as done with meditation the practitioner programs the ego mind with visualization
[02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:26.240]  while monitoring the physiological response thereby programming the subconscious mind by observing
[02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:35.360]  the results with real-time biological feedback the gateway process also known as hemisync achieves
[02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:41.920]  this same goal by simply listening to specific audio frequencies that bring both hemispheres
[02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:48.640]  of the brain into synchronicity with one another all of these practices some of which have been
[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:55.760]  taught for millennia have been proven effective with modern scientific tools the gateway process
[02:02:55.760 --> 02:03:02.080]  has been shown to bring the entire body into a coherent vibration of approximately seven
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:08.800]  to seven point five cycles per second which then creates a resonance with the electrostatic field
[02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:15.440]  of the earth it is believed that this resonance is what allows the practitioner to transcend
[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:22.160]  time and space or in other words allow their consciousness to leave the body without limitation
[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:30.320]  what we call physical matter is not solid at all it is more like a highly advanced holographic
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:37.040]  image made up of different frequencies what we experience as solid matter is actually the
[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:44.720]  electromagnetic repulsion of certain frequencies and this includes our own physical body and so it
[02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:51.440]  is believed that the reason these practices work is because our consciousness is not being generated
[02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:59.360]  by our bodies but rather our bodies are being generated by our consciousness physicists have
[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:05.760]  proven that the physical world is energy and defined time as a measurement of change within
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:13.040]  this energy in order for energy to take form it needs to be limited to a specific vibration
[02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:21.440]  energy at rest is uniformly extended without limit it is everywhere at once this is why humans
[02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:28.320]  are able to remote view which is a term used by the military for their psychic training protocol
[02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:34.960]  wherein they teach an individual to transcend space and time in order to gather information
[02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:41.120]  remotely and this is how mr. guy Saveli was able to drop a goat from a hundred feet away
[02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:47.360]  with his thoughts but most importantly the suppression of this knowledge is how the government
[02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:53.680]  is able to program your subconscious mind for you without you even knowing it and control
[02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:57.760]  you perceive to be reality reporting for info wars
[02:04:57.760 --> 02:05:10.880]  hey what's up bone hey mcbrane what's going on man
[02:05:12.160 --> 02:05:16.640]  hey really like that work you did on the ai piece i'm going to use that on the show today
[02:05:16.640 --> 02:05:20.000]  right on i worked hard on that yeah i'm working on another project so i'm going to be up late
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:29.840]  again tonight and i was hoping he had some brain force plus oh um no no nothing what about brain
[02:05:29.840 --> 02:05:45.040]  force ultra um no okay yeah thanks anyway yeah good luck with that project though
[02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:54.160]  get your brain force plus and brain force ultra right now at informer store dot com
[02:06:01.680 --> 02:06:09.280]  from the front lines of the information war it's owin shroyer you're listening to the alex
[02:06:09.280 --> 02:06:16.160]  jones show all right leon macadoo has astraly projected herself into the studio i tried to
[02:06:16.160 --> 02:06:23.120]  touch her she's not actually physically there it is some sort of a manifested projection
[02:06:23.120 --> 02:06:29.040]  i'm being facetious she is in studio with me but she wants to talk about that last gregory's report
[02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:35.120]  what the government hides from us the power of our minds and you know i kind of have looked at
[02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:40.800]  this in the last two segments from the more of a negative uh aspect where i'm looking at
[02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:48.320]  how we now know and we've talked about this before we now we're learning more about the human mind
[02:06:48.320 --> 02:06:54.000]  and how not no two human minds are the same it's not a universal system that that each of us have
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:59.680]  in our brain minds and brains work differently depending on the individual whether it's a visual
[02:06:59.680 --> 02:07:04.720]  thing whether it's an audio thing we're learning more about this that you might see or see or hear
[02:07:04.720 --> 02:07:09.040]  or think something completely different than somebody else just because of the way your brain
[02:07:09.040 --> 02:07:17.200]  works and so i was kind of making the analogy of some people literally cannot see more than one move
[02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:20.880]  in advance these are people that never win a game of chess these are people that probably couldn't
[02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:25.760]  even beat a kindergartner at checkers and so these are people that fall for stuff like abolish the police
[02:07:26.480 --> 02:07:31.200]  stop man made climate change and stuff like this which gets used against them politically so that's
[02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:36.080]  kind of a negative aspect but there is a positive aspect about this as well however the government
[02:07:36.080 --> 02:07:41.040]  has been doing experiments they know all about this stuff they use it against we the people
[02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:46.800]  and it's time for us to understand what's being done behind the scenes absolutely i mean it's
[02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:53.200]  beyond time for us to start kind of taking control of our own minds and understanding that we absolutely
[02:07:53.200 --> 02:07:59.200]  are being targeted in a multitude of ways just the way that they control the information we're
[02:07:59.200 --> 02:08:04.880]  able to access as well as the type of music that gets played on the the radio and the movies that
[02:08:04.880 --> 02:08:11.200]  make it out and become the big hits it's all kind of by design we've you know done reports for years
[02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:17.200]  about how hollywood is kind of in collusion and the media is in collusion with the government and
[02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:23.360]  they have contracts and stuff to be able to access their technology and you know let us fly your
[02:08:23.360 --> 02:08:28.720]  helicopters and crash them in our movies and we'll push your propaganda kind of subliminally and
[02:08:28.720 --> 02:08:34.000]  yeah it's a nice little beneficial relationship they get yeah some very good tit for tat so
[02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:40.160]  you know there's there's a lot to this um our our brains are incredibly powerful if you want to
[02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:46.000]  talk about you know being created in god's image right we really truly are we are our default setting
[02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:51.680]  is just amazing and incredible and we've sort of forgotten that and allowed ourselves to
[02:08:52.720 --> 02:08:58.240]  now be sort of corralled and controlled and you were sort of talking about how all of our minds
[02:08:58.240 --> 02:09:03.840]  are unique and of course they are but the collective consciousness is very real and
[02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:09.920]  you know if you've ever been inside of inside of a huge football stadium for instance and there's
[02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:16.400]  thousands of people all stamping on the bleachers and all everyone chanting in unison for their team
[02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:22.400]  there's like a very powerful energy that rises up there's no doubt you get the goosebumps the
[02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:27.440]  the hairs in the back your neck stand up you can feel that right and so when you and there's a chemical
[02:09:27.440 --> 02:09:34.160]  response to it too absolutely and it's a harnessable energy now you if you've talked to any musicians
[02:09:34.160 --> 02:09:40.080]  or any um you know athletes who are out there who are feeling that energy from the crowd they feel
[02:09:40.080 --> 02:09:44.960]  that energy and it like motivates them and pushes them or the the band is like you know they can get
[02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:51.920]  everyone waving their hands back and forth it is a harnessable energy um and people in power um you've
[02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:58.160]  seen it like with hitler for instance the his marches are a perfect example of millions of people
[02:09:58.160 --> 02:10:04.240]  all lined up in unison and just like caught up in this collective consciousness and so people do
[02:10:04.240 --> 02:10:11.360]  you know you have to be aware of how your mind is being sort of corralled and you know get angry
[02:10:11.360 --> 02:10:16.720]  at that over there and we've seen this scaled too this is scalable we've seen it you can point to
[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:22.640]  many examples with 50 000 100 000 people but even they've done studies with five six ten people in a
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:27.600]  room where i forget the name of the study we highlighted this during covid with the mask issue
[02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:32.960]  where in a controlled experiment they'll have say five people in a room and they'll say all you
[02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:37.520]  need to do is tell us which line on the screen is the longest line on the screen and they'll show
[02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:43.760]  you four lines and line c will clearly be longer than line a b or d but the four people in the group
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:48.160]  that are controlled they always say the smaller lines are the longest in this controlled experiment
[02:10:48.160 --> 02:10:53.040]  and then eventually usually by the third or fourth round even the guy that's not controlled is saying
[02:10:53.040 --> 02:10:56.880]  the smaller lines are longer just because the other people in the room are saying it right
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:11:02.000]  it's the group think and not like not wanting to look foolish or well gosh everyone else sees it
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:08.400]  something must be wrong with me and that really you know is a is a strong testament to how how
[02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:14.640]  how important it is for us to get back to our own discernment and get back to our own inner strength
[02:11:14.640 --> 02:11:20.480]  and our own mind and make sure that what is happening inside of our own minds is the truth
[02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:26.480]  and you know that's this report this gateway process uh that greg rees's report did a great
[02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:32.240]  job at kind of summing that up and then going beyond to sort of say that there's so much more to our
[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:38.960]  human potential this is just one declassified experiment that was going on in the cia that
[02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:46.240]  came out in june 1983 they were working on this it was declassified i think in 2003 and you know
[02:11:46.240 --> 02:11:51.920]  millions of people were made aware of it then of course it's now come back around uh and gotten
[02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:57.200]  repopularized because of tiktok and so now a lot of other younger people are being introduced to this
[02:11:57.200 --> 02:12:06.720]  information and we've already kind of collectively been more introduced to yoga and meditation
[02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:11.360]  and hypnosis and so 50 years ago when they were first starting to study these things
[02:12:11.920 --> 02:12:18.000]  scientifically anyway it was kind of woo it was weird and no one believed it but now the younger
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:23.120]  generations they'll just soak all this up and so you know it's very interesting to see it being
[02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:28.640]  introduced to we're ready for it is kind of what people are saying is that we're ready to see that
[02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:36.000]  missing 25th page of how the tor the the torus energy works um in our brains and you know it's
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:43.120]  it's time and so this is information that they have been sort of studying and it's been classified
[02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:49.680]  for decades um but we're ready to sort of to to receive this information and start applying it in
[02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:55.520]  our life this is what got me interested in uh studying hypnosis and you know just the power
[02:12:55.520 --> 02:13:01.840]  of hypnotherapy and also using Hertz frequencies and brain entrainment to just sort of uh recalibrate
[02:13:01.840 --> 02:13:09.280]  and come back to that resting state of uh just truth really um so many people kind of walking
[02:13:09.280 --> 02:13:14.240]  around like wounded and not even realizing that their thoughts are projecting out into reality
[02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:22.080]  um you know so when you're focusing on fear or devastation or pain or you know torture um
[02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:26.640]  you don't realize that you're actually reflecting that out and attracting more of that into your
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:33.200]  life and this this gateway process talks about talks about basically the hologram this holographic
[02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:38.720]  nature of reality that we are living in and how important it is to sort of work on your mind
[02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:45.360]  in your brain and um you know get it get it into a it's called hemisync but sort of get the left
[02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:49.840]  and the right brain in coherence with each other so that they're not actively working against each
[02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:55.040]  other well and you know you bring up the issue of the brain damage and so I kind of have like there's
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:14:01.280]  a there's a there's for me there's a two different responses there's the fight or flight kind of
[02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:06.480]  survival of the fittest response which is like if you're going to go get that COVID vaccine three
[02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:13.040]  four five times and die then so be it that's the more animalistic side to me but then there's the
[02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:17.920]  compassionate side then there's the human side that says no no no wait a second you've been brain
[02:14:17.920 --> 02:14:23.200]  damage I mean you've literally been brain damage that was this would be like I make the comparison
[02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:29.760]  of if you see a war veteran who had his leg blown off uh fighting a war in let's say Afghanistan
[02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:34.720]  and coming up to them and saying oh you're an idiot you went and fought in war you lost your leg
[02:14:34.720 --> 02:14:39.360]  well no they were told they wanted to go fight this war they were told why they were going to
[02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:44.080]  fight this war I'm not gonna I'm not gonna say hey the good guy who went over there and lost his
[02:14:44.080 --> 02:14:49.440]  leg for a good cause is dumb because he did so and it's to me it's like it's the same thing it's like
[02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:55.280]  you got tricked you got brain damaged you really believe this vaccine was gonna help you
[02:14:55.280 --> 02:15:01.840]  so I actually do feel bad you're actually a victim you you have now a victim of brain damage
[02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:07.280]  right and I appreciate that you are having some compassion for people because we really do need
[02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:12.480]  that more in this world it's like we can't help it that perhaps we grew up in a home that there was
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:17.200]  a lot of abuse or neglect and now we take that on with us through the rest of our life we sort of
[02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:22.640]  ride through life with this feeling of unworthiness or unlovability and then you go out and you want
[02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:28.800]  to control your environment and control everyone around you or project that self-hatred onto others
[02:15:28.800 --> 02:15:33.120]  and so there is you know a good this is a good time for care but I mean after the break I'd love
[02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:40.080]  to talk about you know that fear programming and how it leaves you in that beta brainwave state
[02:15:40.080 --> 02:15:46.160]  that's highly controllable and now with the modern technology and the screen time and even the
[02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:52.080]  virtual reality this is an even bigger issue the juxtaposition is even greater we'll be right back
[02:15:52.080 --> 02:16:02.000]  with leon macado look it's not hype when you've delivered and info wars has been the tip of

[02:20:20.240 --> 02:20:31.520]  this is a live look inside leon and macadoo's brain
[02:20:33.360 --> 02:20:36.560]  we're still studying it we're still trying to figure out how it works
[02:20:37.120 --> 02:20:41.360]  me too some are probably wondering if they can smoke it and get high off of it that's what
[02:20:41.360 --> 02:20:46.640]  hunter biden is asking but no uh getting serious though you were discussing this in the last
[02:20:46.640 --> 02:20:54.080]  segment how the youth is more interested in this stuff and you're seeing you know whether it's
[02:20:54.080 --> 02:20:58.480]  tiktok or other social media platforms where they're discussing this stuff and i think that's
[02:20:58.480 --> 02:21:06.560]  because the juxtaposition is so different now with the majority of their time is probably now
[02:21:06.560 --> 02:21:12.800]  spent in front of a screen whether it's at home whether it's at school versus even i mean heck
[02:21:12.800 --> 02:21:18.400]  even even growing up myself i mean we had video games we had we had tv's and stuff i didn't have
[02:21:18.400 --> 02:21:23.360]  the smartphone and the cell phone but even with that i spent most of my days outside i still rode
[02:21:23.360 --> 02:21:27.760]  bikes i still climbed fences i still skipped rocks i still climbed cliffs i scraped my knee you know
[02:21:27.760 --> 02:21:33.920]  there was still kind of that the balance of human in nature wasn't so out of sync but even you go
[02:21:33.920 --> 02:21:42.160]  back 50 years but now it's like that balance almost doesn't exist so now it's the the the phenomenon
[02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:46.720]  or the trend of nature bathing right where it's like oh going out in nature is bathing well
[02:21:46.720 --> 02:21:53.120]  that used to be called tuesday like it is so but so now the youth is so into the fake realm
[02:21:53.840 --> 02:21:58.640]  that they're looking for anything to give them something real again even if it's
[02:21:58.640 --> 02:22:03.360]  way out there like let me go into my mind and figure out how it works right and it definitely
[02:22:03.360 --> 02:22:08.240]  makes it easier to comprehend the simulation theory that we're all kind of living in a simulation
[02:22:08.240 --> 02:22:14.160]  this one big computer game and you know it just sort of makes it makes sense when you kind of
[02:22:14.160 --> 02:22:19.920]  grow up in that world where all of your thoughts i mean not yet allegedly but now we have to actually
[02:22:19.920 --> 02:22:25.040]  say the words out loud and our phone will pop up pop it up for us oh you i just heard you were
[02:22:25.040 --> 02:22:29.840]  talking about this let me yeah now you got a book recommendation i got a purchase recommendation
[02:22:29.840 --> 02:22:34.800]  yes and soon they'd like to be able to when we just think it then it'll send the signals and
[02:22:34.800 --> 02:22:39.200]  and they're working on that everything is just energy right and so it's just figuring out how to
[02:22:39.760 --> 02:22:45.040]  hack into the brain hacking into those those waves the wavelengths that you know we're always
[02:22:45.040 --> 02:22:49.760]  constantly emitting and so it would i personally don't think we're anywhere near that well to be
[02:22:49.760 --> 02:22:55.680]  wonderful well so we've kind of forgotten the brain initiative during the obama administration
[02:22:55.680 --> 02:23:02.720]  where you know billions of dollars in funding i i know i apologize for what's ended lots of reports
[02:23:02.720 --> 02:23:08.240]  on that but just all of the what what what happened to that where you know where the hell that money
[02:23:08.240 --> 02:23:14.800]  go that we spent basically just to figure out how the brain works and what what we can do with it
[02:23:14.800 --> 02:23:20.880]  how we can hack it and unfortunately darpa always tries to take this technology first and turn it
[02:23:20.880 --> 02:23:26.960]  into a weapon before it kind of gets passed along to the masses and they're slowly starting to trickle
[02:23:26.960 --> 02:23:32.560]  it out now they're sort of talking about how sound is going to be helping destroy brain tumors
[02:23:32.560 --> 02:23:37.520]  and help with autoimmune disease people that have seizures and different types of things
[02:23:37.520 --> 02:23:42.480]  like that they're which are all just frequencies right and it's like oh this is going to come around
[02:23:42.480 --> 02:23:48.320]  someday but people have been studying this and trying to prove that this is a thing for decades
[02:23:48.320 --> 02:23:54.720]  now but of course you know big pharma or you know just that whole industry doesn't want people to
[02:23:54.720 --> 02:23:59.760]  necessarily access that oh well of course imagine if you could naturally heal yourself
[02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:06.480]  with sound waves i mean that might be the extreme far side of healing but even with just natural
[02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:11.520]  products like even just fruit like they don't want you to know about fruits that can help you stay
[02:24:11.520 --> 02:24:17.600]  healthier or even some believe can cure cancer right or oxygen even oxygen heaven forbid you'd
[02:24:17.600 --> 02:24:22.240]  hear you know what they taught you in elementary school about you are what you eat and how food
[02:24:22.240 --> 02:24:27.120]  is well cancer is a multi-billion dollar industry pride trillion right exactly and and and there's
[02:24:27.120 --> 02:24:31.440]  so many people that they push their kids to be doctors or lawyers which means we're going to
[02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:36.880]  be in this perpetual state of being sick and sued in order to prop up that system that we're
[02:24:36.880 --> 02:24:43.520]  it's just self-perpetuating but but yes it would be really wonderful if we could just take it on
[02:24:43.520 --> 02:24:50.080]  ourselves our own initiative to sort of hack our own brains and understand for ourselves these the
[02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:55.200]  information is out there if you go and look um and just kind of try to understand a little bit
[02:24:55.200 --> 02:24:59.360]  about how you can hack your own brain i mean you can go listen to these binaural beats or
[02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:04.640]  hurts frequencies they're all over you do that of course i do it's one of the reasons why i am a
[02:25:04.640 --> 02:25:11.680]  hypnot therapist it works for you a hundred percent yes and there's uh even just show me the science
[02:25:12.800 --> 02:25:18.080]  i have the document you were close you're supposed to say i am the science i that's why people are
[02:25:18.080 --> 02:25:24.160]  like yeah oh yeah you know you you drink you drink raw eggs well it will show me the science
[02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:32.240]  bitch i am the science i don't see any six pack that's because my clothes are on great that's a
[02:25:32.240 --> 02:25:39.760]  good that's a good thing so yes well i'm not jeffrey tubin so is that the uh man who's spending
[02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:44.080]  two million dollars a year to know i forget leon mac and who's way out of the political spectrum
[02:25:44.080 --> 02:25:49.840]  she might know jeffrey tubin was uh masturbating on a camera oh i see an end host oh that's right
[02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:54.080]  yeah i i blocked that one out of my brain because it's back this is back baby this is what i've
[02:25:54.080 --> 02:25:59.520]  injected it i i tap in every once in a while to the sardoodledom and that's the kind of stuff you see
[02:25:59.520 --> 02:26:06.560]  and it's like oh yes we are still being programmed by master debaters who don't even get fired for
[02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:12.880]  doing that oh imagine you turn on cnn there's jeffrey tubin yeah he's here with the hard-hitting
[02:26:12.880 --> 02:26:19.680]  news that you can trust that these are degenerates and this kind of all ties back into how we
[02:26:19.680 --> 02:26:27.600]  our world is being controlled and uh led and steered by people who have never really kind of
[02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:33.120]  hacked into why am i a degenerate that would do that on a zoom call with or they've never tried
[02:26:33.120 --> 02:26:37.040]  something else yeah they don't even know what it's like on the other side we have all these
[02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:42.560]  wounded people just walking around the planet on the one hand you want to give people um you know
[02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:47.200]  compassion in that regard and let's all start trying to maybe help each other heal those wounds
[02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:54.160]  but on the other hand stop giving your power to these people who are just wounded and potentially
[02:26:54.160 --> 02:26:59.440]  evil and maybe even psychotic break well like imagine you could you could if let's say you're
[02:26:59.440 --> 02:27:04.240]  an advanced civilization or advanced species or something and you could go and and you find a
[02:27:04.960 --> 02:27:09.680]  a life form that is clearly less intelligent and you can take it one or two ways you can say oh
[02:27:09.680 --> 02:27:14.960]  i'm gonna conquer this life form and i'm gonna make him my slaves essentially or i'm gonna empower
[02:27:14.960 --> 02:27:19.120]  them and make them more prosperous to get them on my level right and that's what we know the
[02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:24.640]  globalist well we know how they feel about us humans yeah absolutely and that is why i have
[02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:30.080]  taken it upon myself to unplug from all of that and to plug in to these other things that are
[02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:36.480]  actually going to help me um reach my potential and we all have this inside of us it's just
[02:27:36.480 --> 02:27:40.800]  informing yourself and i know alex is talking about this all the time that's why he's come up
[02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:45.840]  with so many incredible products to help people um but just you know the brain wave states i mean
[02:27:45.840 --> 02:27:53.440]  even just understanding how news media and that fear programming it emits a certain frequency
[02:27:53.440 --> 02:27:58.640]  that keeps your brain in this beta wave state which is that's what those are the waves that
[02:27:58.640 --> 02:28:03.280]  are going on when you're in fear thinking when you're in that fight or flight mode most people
[02:28:03.280 --> 02:28:08.320]  are in their beta wave thinking state all the time or or when they're asleep they'll go into the
[02:28:08.320 --> 02:28:13.200]  delta frequencies but for the most part people are always going to be in that beta it's very
[02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:19.760]  controllable and if you want to put someone into a very light state of hypnosis we do it all the
[02:28:19.760 --> 02:28:25.840]  time if you suspend your consciousness watching a movie watching the news it pulls you into that
[02:28:25.840 --> 02:28:30.320]  frequency well let's give a real world example before we take this break i think covid is the
[02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:35.360]  best real world example you tune on the tv you're told this virus is killer it's going to kill you
[02:28:35.360 --> 02:28:39.520]  it's going to kill your grandma okay you're in the state of fear now you're walking around you see
[02:28:39.520 --> 02:28:44.480]  the masks you see the lockdowns you see the barriers now that the state of fear continues
[02:28:44.480 --> 02:28:49.200]  and now guess what you're in the state of fear you've just been told to take this vaccine now
[02:28:49.200 --> 02:28:55.200]  you've just had a sudden cardiac event see how that works yeah you look to the leader save me
[02:28:55.200 --> 02:29:02.560]  save me we'll be right back i talk a lot about the great successes info wars this
[02:29:02.560 --> 02:29:08.240]  had i don't think anybody can deny it and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us
[02:29:08.960 --> 02:29:13.040]  when we talk about the crew at info wars people behind the scenes the researchers the riders

[02:32:15.440 --> 02:32:26.960]  and behold a pale horse and he that sat on the horse was named death
[02:32:26.960 --> 02:32:35.440]  now the translation is i looked and behold a pale horse
[02:32:37.280 --> 02:32:43.360]  and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him a book of revelation
[02:32:45.360 --> 02:32:49.360]  very serious times to be alive folks they're not just doing this is one off this is the beginning
[02:32:49.360 --> 02:32:54.000]  of the rest of our lives this is our fight and i'm proud of humanity the globalists even admit
[02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:57.920]  it's leaked they're very upset that they're losing and and that this hasn't gone the way they thought
[02:32:57.920 --> 02:33:05.840]  it would leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[02:33:05.840 --> 02:33:19.680]  is
[02:33:21.840 --> 02:33:30.400]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones and now your host
[02:33:30.400 --> 02:33:36.720]  owin treuer and leon macadoo in studio and i don't know if confirmation bias is the right
[02:33:37.280 --> 02:33:43.520]  term for this because quite frankly the subject material here does not get covered in your college
[02:33:43.520 --> 02:33:50.960]  psychology classes but i think that it might be the most relevant example or terminology to use here
[02:33:51.680 --> 02:33:58.640]  where we're discussing this hey you know that line c is the longest line on the slide but
[02:33:58.640 --> 02:34:02.880]  everybody else in the room keeps saying it's line b so i'm just gonna say it's line b and
[02:34:02.880 --> 02:34:06.800]  i'm gonna go along to get along or whether it's the mass formation psychosis like we
[02:34:06.800 --> 02:34:10.800]  witnessed with the nazis in germany or what we're witnessing today quite frankly but
[02:34:12.240 --> 02:34:20.080]  here's why they put the gay flag in the classroom put the black lives matter flag in the classroom
[02:34:20.080 --> 02:34:26.160]  tell trans kids they're beautiful uh you know men can be women men in the women's locker room
[02:34:26.160 --> 02:34:30.640]  it's all this surrounding you with this propaganda that obviously makes no sense men
[02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:35.600]  can't get pregnant men can't have periods men are not women this is not even up for debate
[02:34:35.600 --> 02:34:40.960]  but when they flood the zone with that propaganda and you're you're forced to consume it from
[02:34:40.960 --> 02:34:47.120]  you're a kid well now all of a sudden you think it's real it becomes reality right and why are kids
[02:34:47.680 --> 02:34:51.920]  why is this anything that they they should be worrying their brains about anyway why aren't
[02:34:51.920 --> 02:34:58.080]  we learning about human potential why aren't we learning more about how to enhance our cognitive
[02:34:58.080 --> 02:35:04.400]  abilities psychic abilities i mean the cia is trying to work on astral projection and remote
[02:35:04.400 --> 02:35:10.080]  viewing so that they can you know get military access without having actually physically travel to
[02:35:10.080 --> 02:35:15.280]  an alternate place and then of course in this in this gateway process he's talking about also
[02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:21.520]  preparing yourselves for if you do step outside of your body and go to these astral realms that
[02:35:21.520 --> 02:35:27.360]  you might engage with some other entities or other beings and you need to prepare yourself in order
[02:35:27.360 --> 02:35:34.320]  to engage with this type of energy so they're looking at all of this other other stuff that's
[02:35:34.320 --> 02:35:39.440]  kind of like this hidden kind of occulted information while we're all fighting about
[02:35:39.440 --> 02:35:45.200]  you know gay wedding cakes being baked and stuff and it's like i get it that stuff matters but it's
[02:35:45.200 --> 02:35:52.080]  like they keep us constantly bickering and fighting over things that we have absolutely no control
[02:35:52.080 --> 02:35:59.360]  over which keeps us again in these beta wave states of just like fear confusion um depression
[02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:05.120]  anxiety you know so we're in this constant state of anxiety oh what should i do i just i have no
[02:36:05.120 --> 02:36:10.800]  control over anything and then of course because we are animals you know it's like our animal instinct
[02:36:10.800 --> 02:36:17.040]  we always want to then look to the leader when we are afraid or we need answers or solutions that's
[02:36:17.040 --> 02:36:23.600]  actually part of how hypnosis works is just understanding that humans are you know basically
[02:36:23.600 --> 02:36:28.080]  high-grade animals and so they're going to look to the leader when they get put into a state of
[02:36:28.080 --> 02:36:33.920]  shock and then you're there as the hypnotist to be able to kind of you know ease them into this
[02:36:34.720 --> 02:36:39.600]  state of relaxing their left brain relaxing their conscious mind so that they can put that to the
[02:36:39.600 --> 02:36:45.840]  side and allow things to new suggestions and possibilities to come in well here's why i bring
[02:36:45.840 --> 02:36:52.640]  up the issue with the propaganda aimed at the children is because what they can do is they can
[02:36:53.920 --> 02:37:01.280]  destroy your own instincts before you have fully formed your brain so that you are a healthy adult
[02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:07.680]  with a functioning brain they destroy it when you're a kid here's an example and i don't want to
[02:37:07.680 --> 02:37:11.040]  scoop there's a reporter that's about to come out with this story so i don't want to scoop them but
[02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:16.080]  basically there's an establishment here in texas much like some of the public schools where they
[02:37:16.080 --> 02:37:22.800]  put tampons and feminine products in the boy's bathroom and so there's an instance again i don't
[02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:29.040]  want to scoop this reporter but i'm you know just to use this as a subject material here a young boy
[02:37:29.680 --> 02:37:36.880]  goes into the boy's bathroom and sees feminine products and this boy is young enough to not
[02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:45.680]  fully understand but old enough to have an idea right so sees the tampons and says oh you know
[02:37:45.680 --> 02:37:53.520]  daddy why are there women's products in the boy's room and and so he still has the basic
[02:37:53.520 --> 02:37:59.600]  instincts he still has the basic understanding to know that's not right men are not women well
[02:37:59.600 --> 02:38:03.840]  now he's getting the propaganda and sadly in this case the father didn't know what else to say except
[02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:10.240]  that oh well now men can be women too and so you have to have these products and so the point is
[02:38:10.240 --> 02:38:19.360]  no that young boy in the men's room understands boys or boys girls or girls inherently knows that
[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:23.200]  basic fact you really don't even need to go to school to figure that out you probably figured
[02:38:23.200 --> 02:38:28.240]  it out but okay there they are he thinks he's figured it out he thinks he understands the world
[02:38:28.240 --> 02:38:34.160]  now boom here's this piece of propaganda put right in front of him it confuses him and instead of
[02:38:34.160 --> 02:38:39.120]  having somebody they're saying no no no this is propaganda out to destroy your brain instead it's
[02:38:39.120 --> 02:38:45.280]  oh men can be women now and now you just reset his entire instincts you just reset his entire
[02:38:45.280 --> 02:38:51.280]  inherent understanding of biology with just one little piece of propaganda absolutely and children
[02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:57.920]  up until about the age seven are like constantly in this state of hypnosis where they can be
[02:38:57.920 --> 02:39:01.680]  they're just soaking everything up like a sponge and that's why they're impressionable
[02:39:01.680 --> 02:39:06.000]  very impressionable that's why most of the traumatic you know things that might happen when
[02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:09.680]  your kid something can happen and that just sets a belief for the whole rest of your life
[02:39:10.240 --> 02:39:16.000]  and so they're incredibly impressionable their minds are just always open up until about maybe
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:23.360]  14 years old you know depending on how how you mature but for the most part kids and that that
[02:39:23.360 --> 02:39:27.600]  is why it's like we need to get in there young we're going to start talking to them about sex
[02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:35.120]  in kindergarten why why are children even needing to have this type of information well it's because
[02:39:35.120 --> 02:39:41.280]  they are ripe their minds are ripe they are absolute sponges and here in this gateway
[02:39:41.280 --> 02:39:47.200]  process again it talks about how with this holographic nature of our mind how whatever
[02:39:47.200 --> 02:39:53.760]  we put in our in the left hemisphere it basically goes through the left is filtered through or
[02:39:53.760 --> 02:39:57.920]  I'm sorry it comes in through the right and it creates it's like our creative side of our brain
[02:39:57.920 --> 02:40:03.040]  so we kind of can imagine it and then it filters through the left so that the left brain can then
[02:40:03.040 --> 02:40:08.800]  materialize it and actualize it and that's why we are incredible and our brains are we have these
[02:40:08.800 --> 02:40:13.680]  two sides to us because we are kind of like a super cute computer if you will to where we have
[02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:19.520]  the create creative capacity to sort of tap into that infinite wisdom that gives us an idea and then
[02:40:19.520 --> 02:40:24.480]  we now are able to process it through and turn it into a reality tangible that we can see here in
[02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:29.840]  the 3d so that's why when you're working with young minds young impressionable minds you're
[02:40:29.840 --> 02:40:35.920]  giving them this planting these seeds of information that is going into their very fertile soil of their
[02:40:35.920 --> 02:40:41.520]  brain so now they're thinking and imagining it and visualizing it and it then gets filtered through
[02:40:41.520 --> 02:40:48.240]  and becomes reality kind of in the future and that's what I like my nephew he's he doesn't know
[02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:52.400]  what he wants to be when he grows up I'm like the things that are going to be there when it's time
[02:40:52.400 --> 02:40:57.920]  for you to get to work don't even exist yet they haven't even been invented yet and it's all of
[02:40:57.920 --> 02:41:03.680]  these younger people who are having new information put in their brain so they're coming up with a
[02:41:03.680 --> 02:41:07.760]  new creative things that we haven't even thought of yet and then they're never even have been there
[02:41:07.760 --> 02:41:11.760]  never even existed right and they're going to be actualizing these things kind of in the future
[02:41:11.760 --> 02:41:18.240]  which is wonderful and incredible and awesome as long as we're allowing our our minds to be
[02:41:19.120 --> 02:41:23.360]  just infinite possibility but think about it that's the problem this is what you need to think
[02:41:23.360 --> 02:41:28.320]  and it goes against all science from beyond this is this is one of the things that has been
[02:41:28.320 --> 02:41:34.160]  driving me before I even got into politics I always saw this and that's instead of injecting
[02:41:34.160 --> 02:41:38.400]  the youth with ideas that don't empower anybody that don't build a future at all it destroys the
[02:41:38.400 --> 02:41:42.720]  future actually we should be building a youth that says hey you see problems guess what you're the
[02:41:42.720 --> 02:41:46.960]  problem solver exactly you're the person that solves the problem you see the traffic going
[02:41:46.960 --> 02:41:50.880]  in and out of the city you're the person that admits the new way of travel you see the problem
[02:41:50.880 --> 02:41:54.960]  with with homelessness or whatever goes on you're the person that motivates people to get out you're
[02:41:54.960 --> 02:42:00.400]  the person that solves the issue instead we take away real issues that could we could solve to
[02:42:00.400 --> 02:42:04.080]  empower humanity and we inject it with fake issues like hey you're a little boy but you actually
[02:42:04.080 --> 02:42:09.360]  might be a little girl and that's a good thing and it's like looking at this picture in the
[02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:14.560]  background it is all of these old minds the old world the old control they're trying to figure
[02:42:14.560 --> 02:42:19.920]  out ways to continue to hang on to their power because it's only a matter of time before this
[02:42:19.920 --> 02:42:25.040]  human potential kind of snaps on in all of us the young people even though a lot of them are being
[02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:30.800]  propagated to and you're you kind of worry but they're also they're like no we're we don't want
[02:42:30.800 --> 02:42:35.600]  to work in your old paradigm anymore we're ready to do something new and so that's what the old
[02:42:35.600 --> 02:42:41.920]  world order is very afraid of how can we control the minds now to continue to be in control in the
[02:42:41.920 --> 02:42:45.520]  new world and that's why they're hitting the youth with more propaganda than we've ever seen
[02:42:45.520 --> 02:42:51.280]  all right one more segment with lienne macadoo i want to tie all of this into gut health because

[02:47:28.080 --> 02:47:46.560]  md
[02:47:47.520 --> 02:47:53.520]  final segment here with leon macadoo in studio and i want to get into how this all ties in
[02:47:53.520 --> 02:48:01.520]  to the gut because people need to understand there has been an attack on your gut with
[02:48:01.520 --> 02:48:06.720]  the synthetic food and you know we've talked about this i know leon you've talked about this
[02:48:06.720 --> 02:48:11.120]  and we've sold products trying to address this with the the prebiotics and the bacteria and
[02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:16.080]  everything but basically what happens in your modern diet is you're not getting any of any of
[02:48:16.080 --> 02:48:21.360]  the good gut gut flora and gut bacteria in fact most of the food you're eating is actually
[02:48:21.360 --> 02:48:26.400]  destroying that and the gut flora and the gut bacteria that quite frankly has maybe even been
[02:48:26.400 --> 02:48:31.600]  there for millions of years i'm not exaggerating and and this is this is why this is such an
[02:48:31.600 --> 02:48:35.200]  important thing with the gut health there's a reason why the saying go with your gut actually
[02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:44.880]  there's truth to that because you maybe before the modern day diets have inherited a wealth of
[02:48:44.880 --> 02:48:50.720]  information and experience and even an immune system from your great great great great great
[02:48:50.720 --> 02:48:53.680]  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great
[02:48:53.680 --> 02:48:58.640]  great great grandparents literally passed on through the gut health through the gut bacteria
[02:48:58.640 --> 02:49:04.240]  it's passed on forever and so that's why you share an immune system with your family and
[02:49:04.240 --> 02:49:09.520]  it gets passed down and passed down and passed down so through your gut bacteria and the gut
[02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:14.800]  health passed down you have years and years generations and generations of knowledge
[02:49:14.800 --> 02:49:20.400]  and understanding but once they get the now on your bad diet and you've you've basically erased
[02:49:20.400 --> 02:49:23.560]  you've erased your entire family history, you've erased everything that's been learned
[02:49:23.560 --> 02:49:26.640]  throughout your lineage just by killing all the gut bacteria.
[02:49:26.640 --> 02:49:27.640]  They know that.
[02:49:27.640 --> 02:49:32.760]  And so now they've reset your gut, you've lost the thousands of years of knowledge and experience
[02:49:32.760 --> 02:49:36.480]  through your gut, and now they can reset it and tell you men or women everything's gay
[02:49:36.480 --> 02:49:37.800]  and everything else that goes on.
[02:49:37.800 --> 02:49:44.200]  So this is a very serious issue that not many people understand or appreciate that I think
[02:49:44.200 --> 02:49:46.920]  we're really maybe on the verge of understanding.
[02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:47.920]  Right.
[02:49:47.920 --> 02:49:48.920]  It is incredible.
[02:49:48.920 --> 02:49:50.800]  And why they call the gut the second brain.
[02:49:50.800 --> 02:49:55.120]  I mean, there's your nervous system is actually from the brain to the gut.
[02:49:55.120 --> 02:50:00.160]  It is just there's almost before you can even think something your gut is responding because
[02:50:00.160 --> 02:50:04.920]  it has the same receptors that your brain has in your gut.
[02:50:04.920 --> 02:50:11.600]  And so of course, if you are suppressing that or feeding your gut, feeding the bad bacteria
[02:50:11.600 --> 02:50:16.880]  that is in your gut, you're, you're lethargic, you've got brain fog, you're depressed, you
[02:50:16.880 --> 02:50:18.600]  have anxiety.
[02:50:18.600 --> 02:50:22.760]  And it's like no wonder that so many people are walking around just sort of sick.
[02:50:22.760 --> 02:50:23.920]  And think about it too.
[02:50:23.920 --> 02:50:28.080]  They want you when you, when you breastfeed as a baby, you're literally inheriting that
[02:50:28.080 --> 02:50:29.080]  knowledge.
[02:50:29.080 --> 02:50:31.880]  It is like a, it is so sacred.
[02:50:31.880 --> 02:50:37.080]  And that's why they don't want women breastfeeding because they don't want that special generations
[02:50:37.080 --> 02:50:38.520]  of knowledge passed on.
[02:50:38.520 --> 02:50:39.520]  Right.
[02:50:39.520 --> 02:50:40.520]  Or their natural immunity.
[02:50:40.520 --> 02:50:42.560]  No, you need to go get the vaccine for it.
[02:50:42.560 --> 02:50:46.480]  We can't just do it the way that it's always been done and that we were designed.
[02:50:46.480 --> 02:50:52.920]  Our bodies are magnificently designed in order to just keep us healthy and keep us moving
[02:50:52.920 --> 02:50:55.560]  on and evolving.
[02:50:55.560 --> 02:50:56.880]  So I think that's a big issue.
[02:50:56.880 --> 02:51:01.000]  People need to be aware of, and that's why you need to monitor your diets, monitor your
[02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:02.200]  gut health.
[02:51:02.200 --> 02:51:06.320]  And it causes so many problems, not just obviously with the body, but with the mind.
[02:51:06.320 --> 02:51:10.960]  Were you the one that was talking to me about being afraid to do any intestinal cleanses
[02:51:10.960 --> 02:51:11.960]  though?
[02:51:11.960 --> 02:51:12.960]  Yeah.
[02:51:12.960 --> 02:51:13.960]  Well, the parasite cleanse.
[02:51:13.960 --> 02:51:14.960]  Yeah.
[02:51:14.960 --> 02:51:16.120]  Because your parasites might actually be giving you your edge.
[02:51:16.120 --> 02:51:17.480]  No, we were talking about this.
[02:51:17.480 --> 02:51:20.320]  I said, you know, I'm thinking about doing a parasite cleanse, but part of me is afraid
[02:51:20.320 --> 02:51:25.680]  to because I don't want to lose something goodness or maybe lose some good bacteria or, like
[02:51:25.680 --> 02:51:26.840]  you said, lose my edge.
[02:51:26.840 --> 02:51:30.520]  Like I get rid of my parasites all of a sudden to my different person.
[02:51:30.520 --> 02:51:31.920]  You very well could be.
[02:51:31.920 --> 02:51:32.920]  Absolutely.
[02:51:32.920 --> 02:51:37.200]  And I think that's why dogs kind of have that instinct when they can tell who's your family
[02:51:37.200 --> 02:51:40.440]  member because you all sort of have that same microbiome you share.
[02:51:40.440 --> 02:51:41.440]  That's right.
[02:51:41.440 --> 02:51:42.440]  And they can smell it.
[02:51:42.440 --> 02:51:43.440]  Exactly.
[02:51:43.440 --> 02:51:45.200]  And I think that's definitely what it is.
[02:51:45.200 --> 02:51:49.960]  And so for sure, getting control of the gut, getting control of the brain, the mind, it
[02:51:49.960 --> 02:51:53.120]  all absolutely starts, starts with your diet really.
[02:51:53.120 --> 02:51:58.200]  But then there's just simple things that we can do that here's the science.
[02:51:58.200 --> 02:52:02.720]  And I have some video if you guys wanted to pull up b-roll so people can see if they're
[02:52:02.720 --> 02:52:03.720]  watching.
[02:52:03.720 --> 02:52:06.640]  And this is, this is information that's been around for a long time as well.
[02:52:06.640 --> 02:52:07.640]  But you know what?
[02:52:07.640 --> 02:52:08.640]  Consider this.
[02:52:08.640 --> 02:52:12.800]  You're prompt to look into it again to maybe reapply it back in your life.
[02:52:12.800 --> 02:52:17.160]  But it was Dr. Masaru Emoto and water consciousness.
[02:52:17.160 --> 02:52:22.880]  And people have seen those videos where the water molecules actually would change based
[02:52:22.880 --> 02:52:28.920]  on frequencies that were projected into the water molecule or words or prayer.
[02:52:28.920 --> 02:52:34.800]  And so his book was titled The Hidden Messages in Water.
[02:52:34.800 --> 02:52:36.440]  And there's video of it as well.
[02:52:36.440 --> 02:52:42.240]  And you can just see how these water molecules will just crystallize based on if you say,
[02:52:42.240 --> 02:52:46.120]  you know, love and gratitude versus you disgust me or you make me sick.
[02:52:46.120 --> 02:52:47.120]  I hate you.
[02:52:47.120 --> 02:52:53.920]  And it can, it just actually goes from like a sacred geometrical form to just like chaos
[02:52:53.920 --> 02:52:54.920]  and noise.
[02:52:54.920 --> 02:52:58.600]  But doesn't that kind of actually prove the power of the mind?
[02:52:58.600 --> 02:53:01.200]  Because noise is out of your mouth really don't make the difference.
[02:53:01.200 --> 02:53:04.760]  It's what the meaning behind them that you know when you say it.
[02:53:04.760 --> 02:53:05.760]  Right.
[02:53:05.760 --> 02:53:10.680]  And that's the prayer is when you're, when you're praying, you're actually putting sound
[02:53:10.680 --> 02:53:12.400]  with intention.
[02:53:12.400 --> 02:53:20.280]  And so the, the water molecules, he actually took some really polluted and toxic water
[02:53:20.280 --> 02:53:22.720]  and then exposed it to prayer.
[02:53:22.720 --> 02:53:28.400]  And so it's just the same exact water molecule, totally toxic, totally polluted.
[02:53:28.400 --> 02:53:31.320]  And then starts saying a Buddhist prayer over it.
[02:53:31.320 --> 02:53:37.840]  And then the water molecule itself re-crystallizes and becomes back into this beautiful sacred
[02:53:37.840 --> 02:53:39.600]  geometric form.
[02:53:39.600 --> 02:53:43.280]  And so they didn't clean the water, they did nothing to it, but it's just showing you
[02:53:43.280 --> 02:53:49.680]  how powerful our words are, how powerful our mind is and just speaking things into existence,
[02:53:49.680 --> 02:53:53.840]  but also how important it is to just speak kindly to yourself.
[02:53:53.840 --> 02:53:56.640]  A lot of times people will be nice to other people.
[02:53:56.640 --> 02:53:57.760]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:53:57.760 --> 02:53:58.760]  Oh, nice to see you.
[02:53:58.760 --> 02:53:59.760]  And then they talk to themselves.
[02:53:59.760 --> 02:54:00.760]  Oh, you're so stupid.
[02:54:00.760 --> 02:54:01.760]  Oh, you messed up again.
[02:54:01.760 --> 02:54:04.360]  Can't believe you're never going to amount to anything.
[02:54:04.360 --> 02:54:06.560]  Like we're so mean to ourselves.
[02:54:06.560 --> 02:54:12.360]  And like it all starts with us and each cell in our body only contains so much water.
[02:54:12.360 --> 02:54:16.200]  Imagine all the water molecules within our body that are just looking like these jagged
[02:54:16.200 --> 02:54:18.200]  edged crystals.
[02:54:18.200 --> 02:54:24.360]  And it could be just as simple as speaking kindly to yourself that you are recalibrating
[02:54:24.360 --> 02:54:26.360]  kind of your molecular structure.
[02:54:26.360 --> 02:54:33.680]  Well, and now I see the dangers of social media even more so where, I mean, you know,
[02:54:33.680 --> 02:54:38.080]  Kim Kardashian's the low hanging fruit, but we'll use her as an example where young girls
[02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:43.400]  see this, this, this woman who's completely fake, face is fake, body is fake, life is
[02:54:43.400 --> 02:54:44.400]  fake.
[02:54:44.400 --> 02:54:48.080]  Everything is fake about her, but they see the picture and it looks real like, wow,
[02:54:48.080 --> 02:54:51.880]  how come I can't look like that or how come I don't have billions of dollars or how come
[02:54:51.880 --> 02:54:54.640]  everything in my life isn't joyful and blissful like Kim Kardashian.
[02:54:54.640 --> 02:54:56.120]  Well, none of that's true.
[02:54:56.120 --> 02:54:57.120]  None of that's true.
[02:54:57.120 --> 02:54:59.760]  Her life is probably, she's probably has the same problems that you have behind the
[02:54:59.760 --> 02:55:02.280]  scenes and her body is entirely fake.
[02:55:02.280 --> 02:55:05.720]  But young girls see that and they think, oh, wow, I must be bad.
[02:55:05.720 --> 02:55:07.160]  I can't, I don't look like that.
[02:55:07.160 --> 02:55:08.600]  I can't look like that.
[02:55:08.600 --> 02:55:13.120]  And so now you have this negative feedback because of the social media.
[02:55:13.120 --> 02:55:14.120]  Mm-hmm.
[02:55:14.120 --> 02:55:15.120]  Right.
[02:55:15.120 --> 02:55:17.680]  And that's actually why I shut my social media down for a while because I just-
[02:55:17.680 --> 02:55:19.200]  We're not going to plug your socials here?
[02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:22.840]  If you want to follow me, I'll come back on and say hi to you for sure.
[02:55:22.840 --> 02:55:27.800]  But it's just, we just kind of need a little bit of quiet time from all that.
[02:55:27.800 --> 02:55:28.800]  There's a lot of noise.
[02:55:28.800 --> 02:55:29.800]  It's a lot of din.
[02:55:29.800 --> 02:55:33.760]  It's just like, shh, you know, and you never have the opportunity to just kind of have
[02:55:33.760 --> 02:55:35.680]  that peace and stillness.
[02:55:35.680 --> 02:55:36.680]  Go outside.
[02:55:36.680 --> 02:55:38.760]  What do I really want at this point in my life?
[02:55:38.760 --> 02:55:44.280]  Who am I versus being constantly bombarded with whatever's trendy or, you know, whatever
[02:55:44.280 --> 02:55:47.440]  they want you to buy, buy this, but you don't need it, but buy it.
[02:55:47.440 --> 02:55:50.480]  And of course, advertisement, that's been around forever.
[02:55:50.480 --> 02:55:56.280]  But more now than ever, we need to be taking back control of our consciousness because
[02:55:56.280 --> 02:56:01.240]  there, the CIA is figuring out how to weaponize our consciousness, how to use our consciousness
[02:56:01.240 --> 02:56:02.240]  to-
[02:56:02.240 --> 02:56:05.720]  Oh, well, look, when I've got, when I've got, when I see thousands of people in Texas
[02:56:05.720 --> 02:56:10.480]  marching to murder babies, I know that they've had their collective consciousness stolen
[02:56:10.480 --> 02:56:11.480]  and taken over.
[02:56:11.480 --> 02:56:12.480]  Absolutely.
[02:56:12.480 --> 02:56:16.960]  And the collective consciousness is there in the fourth dimension, and it is absolutely
[02:56:16.960 --> 02:56:17.960]  harnessable.
[02:56:17.960 --> 02:56:22.360]  And that's why people need to kind of understand, pay attention to the group think, pay attention
[02:56:22.360 --> 02:56:27.200]  to the groups that you're with, and do you agree with what everyone's kind of saying?
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:32.200]  Because believe me, your energy is being harnessed to kind of do that work.
[02:56:32.200 --> 02:56:37.960]  It is powerful, but we all are just, just as simply if we can just start speaking nice
[02:56:37.960 --> 02:56:42.360]  things into our own life, our own brain, that's why the affirmations and things are
[02:56:42.360 --> 02:56:47.320]  so incredibly powerful, because it just starts to reflect out into our world.
[02:56:47.320 --> 02:56:52.120]  And even if you can only just start with your own world, it might help a little bit to-
[02:56:52.120 --> 02:56:57.720]  No, I actually think that's so key is, how can you encourage others to be better if you're
[02:56:57.720 --> 02:56:59.160]  not going to be your best self?
[02:56:59.160 --> 02:57:00.160]  Exactly.
[02:57:00.160 --> 02:57:01.160]  It's all a mutual thing.
[02:57:01.160 --> 02:57:06.120]  You, you, you have your own confidence and you be the best person you can be, and then
[02:57:06.120 --> 02:57:09.280]  you pay that forward by living by example and encouraging other people.
[02:57:09.280 --> 02:57:10.280]  And that's it.
[02:57:10.280 --> 02:57:11.280]  That really is it.
[02:57:11.280 --> 02:57:12.280]  It really is that simple.
[02:57:12.280 --> 02:57:16.400]  Obviously there's a big world out there and we can think of, but we don't, we don't have
[02:57:16.400 --> 02:57:17.480]  control over that.
[02:57:17.480 --> 02:57:20.760]  The only thing we have control over is our own selves.
[02:57:20.760 --> 02:57:23.400]  So you have to start there.
[02:57:23.400 --> 02:57:26.760]  Lee Ann McAdoo, great to have you back in studio.
[02:57:26.760 --> 02:57:30.320]  And soon I will just, soon you're going to have a new special project you're going to
[02:57:30.320 --> 02:57:31.320]  be announcing.
[02:57:31.320 --> 02:57:32.320]  Is that correct?
[02:57:32.320 --> 02:57:33.320]  Yes.
[02:57:33.320 --> 02:57:34.320]  And I will be on the show to announce a new special project.
[02:57:34.320 --> 02:57:35.320]  All right.
[02:57:35.320 --> 02:57:36.320]  So there you go.
[02:57:36.320 --> 02:57:37.320]  There's a deep tease here.
[02:57:37.320 --> 02:57:40.120]  New special project from Lee Ann McAdoo.
[02:57:40.120 --> 02:57:43.520]  I'm sure there's no members of the audience that would want to be hypnotized by you.
[02:57:43.520 --> 02:57:52.120]  So I'm sure that that's not going to be a big thing at all.
[02:57:52.120 --> 02:57:58.120]  Hey, what's up, bone?
[02:57:58.120 --> 02:57:59.120]  Hey, McBreen.
[02:57:59.120 --> 02:58:00.120]  What's going on, man?
[02:58:00.120 --> 02:58:01.120]  What's up?
[02:58:01.120 --> 02:58:04.040]  Hey, really like that work you did on the AI piece?
[02:58:04.040 --> 02:58:05.360]  I'm going to use that on the show today.
[02:58:05.360 --> 02:58:06.360]  Right on.
[02:58:06.360 --> 02:58:07.360]  I worked hard on that.
[02:58:07.360 --> 02:58:08.360]  Yeah.
[02:58:08.360 --> 02:58:09.360]  I'm working on another project.
[02:58:09.360 --> 02:58:10.360]  So I'm going to be up late again tonight.
[02:58:10.360 --> 02:58:12.360]  And I was hoping he had some brain force plus.
[02:58:12.360 --> 02:58:13.360]  No.
[02:58:13.360 --> 02:58:14.360]  Nothing.
[02:58:14.360 --> 02:58:15.360]  Nothing.
[02:58:15.360 --> 02:58:16.360]  No.
[02:58:16.360 --> 02:58:17.360]  Nothing.
[02:58:17.360 --> 02:58:18.360]  Nothing.
[02:58:18.360 --> 02:58:19.360]  Nothing.
[02:58:19.360 --> 02:58:20.360]  What about brain force ultra?
[02:58:20.360 --> 02:58:21.360]  No.
[02:58:21.360 --> 02:58:22.360]  Okay.
[02:58:22.360 --> 02:58:23.360]  Yeah.
[02:58:23.360 --> 02:58:24.360]  Thanks anyway.
[02:58:24.360 --> 02:58:25.360]  Yeah.
[02:58:25.360 --> 02:58:36.160]  Good luck with that project though.
[02:58:36.160 --> 02:58:47.840]  It's your brain force plus and brain force ultra right now at InforWarsStore.com.
[02:58:47.840 --> 02:58:51.800]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line in ForWars MD.
[02:58:51.800 --> 02:58:56.280]  Now, in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are.
[02:58:56.280 --> 02:59:02.040]  But all of these products are already sold on store shelves under other brand names for
[02:59:02.040 --> 02:59:04.920]  up to twice the cost we're selling it to you.
[02:59:04.920 --> 02:59:07.360]  These are high end, these are the very best.
[02:59:07.360 --> 02:59:09.400]  You know our body's ultimate tumor formula is amazing?
[02:59:09.400 --> 02:59:10.400]  Well, guess what?
[02:59:10.400 --> 02:59:17.040]  We now have Tumoring 95 that's basically the same formula for a lower price, CBD oil
[02:59:17.040 --> 02:59:23.800]  of the highest quality, up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact high quality
[02:59:23.800 --> 02:59:25.640]  full spectrum CBD.
[02:59:25.640 --> 02:59:30.840]  And it goes on for all the new InforWars MD products at InforWarsStore.com.
[02:59:30.840 --> 02:59:37.960]  The highest quality directly from the manufacturer to your door at prices up to 50% in some cases
[02:59:37.960 --> 02:59:40.800]  100% lower than what they're sold for in stores.
[02:59:40.800 --> 03:00:02.600]  InforWars MD and InforWarsStore.com.
[03:00:02.600 --> 03:00:07.520]  Okay I've got some business to take care of here quickly.
[03:00:07.520 --> 03:00:13.440]  On Friday I covered a story from the Gateway Pundit headline is the Marco Polo Group editing
[03:00:13.440 --> 03:00:20.400]  documents found on Hunter Biden's laptop and the Marco Polo Group has since reached
[03:00:20.400 --> 03:00:26.640]  out and has demanded a retraction and they've said that they are not editing documents but
[03:00:26.640 --> 03:00:35.240]  there is a simple confusion on the time stamps because of time zones and so therefore the
[03:00:35.240 --> 03:00:40.280]  continuation or report that they are editing emails is inaccurate.
[03:00:40.280 --> 03:00:48.240]  Now in fairness, just so everybody is understanding what's going on here, again I read this Gateway
[03:00:48.240 --> 03:00:55.360]  Pundit report on Friday, Marco Polo sent us a voicemail demanding a retraction of me reading
[03:00:55.360 --> 03:01:01.960]  this and covering this on the air and we have offered for them because in the voicemail
[03:01:01.960 --> 03:01:06.360]  they said they want it corrected, they demand it and they want to discuss it and so we offered
[03:01:06.360 --> 03:01:11.240]  to have them on the air to correct the issue and unfortunately we haven't heard back and
[03:01:11.240 --> 03:01:18.680]  so I'm just going to do the retraction now and hopefully put this thing to rest even
[03:01:18.680 --> 03:01:24.080]  though to the Marco Polo Group that was listening and got this and demanded the retraction today
[03:01:24.080 --> 03:01:28.280]  we offered you the platform to come on here and correct the record, we did not hear back
[03:01:28.280 --> 03:01:32.160]  from you and so I'm just doing the retraction now as you demanded.
[03:01:32.160 --> 03:01:39.440]  So they want you to know the Marco Polo Group is not editing Biden emails, there is a confusion
[03:01:39.440 --> 03:01:42.960]  over the time zones in the emails.
[03:01:42.960 --> 03:01:49.200]  Now there you go, simple as that, I don't claim to be perfect, if I make a mistake I'll correct
[03:01:49.200 --> 03:01:54.600]  the record and if I make a mistake all you have to do is ask for a retraction, it's not
[03:01:54.600 --> 03:01:59.080]  that big of a deal, I'm not a conscious liar, I don't have an agenda and I'm not here to
[03:01:59.080 --> 03:02:04.440]  fool anybody but it's funny that some groups don't even want to give us the opportunity
[03:02:04.440 --> 03:02:09.720]  to offer a retraction, they'd rather sue us for a trillion dollars so at least Marco Polo
[03:02:09.720 --> 03:02:14.680]  is not guilty of that but there you go, want to correct the record from last Friday, Marco
[03:02:14.680 --> 03:02:20.200]  Polo is not editing emails, any confusion over my reporting I hope will be put to rest.
[03:02:20.200 --> 03:02:26.280]  Having said that, Gerald Solente is about to take over and here is a new report from
[03:02:26.280 --> 03:02:28.080]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:02:28.080 --> 03:02:33.280]  Finland proudly announced that it would be including the world's first trans figure skater
[03:02:33.280 --> 03:02:35.840]  at the European Figure Skate Championships.
[03:02:35.840 --> 03:02:41.600]  Marku Pekka Antikainen took up the sport aged 50, declared himself trans and then started
[03:02:41.600 --> 03:02:44.080]  performing under the female named Mina Maria.
[03:02:44.080 --> 03:02:48.960]  The European Championships performance was heralded as a stunning victory for diversity
[03:02:48.960 --> 03:02:49.960]  and inclusivity.
[03:02:49.960 --> 03:02:59.640]  One problem, Mina Maria can't skate, come on here we go, here they comes, come on you
[03:02:59.640 --> 03:03:14.640]  go girl, you got this, yes, yes hold it, hold it and turn, yes and ready go, yes, well done
[03:03:14.640 --> 03:03:22.840]  and now, no it's fine, it's fine get up, get up, it's alright get up, no, no, yes, yes
[03:03:22.840 --> 03:03:30.640]  try again, come on, no, no, send in the flag girls, yeah help people, I mean help her up,
[03:03:30.640 --> 03:03:36.880]  yeah, get the flag, come on, come on, come on Mina Maria, you can go, you can go, it's
[03:03:36.880 --> 03:03:41.800]  not like they weren't warned, Mina Maria previously competed at the 2020 Juno Cup.
[03:03:41.800 --> 03:04:10.760]  And for that stunning, skilled, energetic performance, judges awarded second place,
[03:04:10.760 --> 03:04:14.680]  zero hedge comments, similar to the way in which children competitors are sometimes given
[03:04:14.680 --> 03:04:19.160]  special treatment because judges are afraid to hurt their feelings, the culture of participation
[03:04:19.160 --> 03:04:24.200]  trophies and special allowances for trans participants is slowly erasing competitive environments
[03:04:24.200 --> 03:04:30.120]  and turning athletics into a joke, okay transphobe, all I see is a culture of stunning bravery,
[03:04:30.120 --> 03:04:33.680]  the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears, it was their final
[03:04:33.680 --> 03:04:57.640]  most essential command.
[03:04:57.640 --> 03:05:03.080]  Info wars has made history, you have made history by supporting info wars, the globalist
[03:05:03.080 --> 03:05:07.720]  are being defeated on every front, and now is the time to not just sit on our laurels
[03:05:07.720 --> 03:05:12.840]  because we're winning battles, let's win the war, the information war, there's nothing
[03:05:12.840 --> 03:05:17.240]  you can do more important than keeping info wars on air in the fight for liberty, I don't
[03:05:17.240 --> 03:05:21.440]  think anybody denies that fact, and I thank you for your past support, but I'm encouraging
[03:05:21.440 --> 03:05:27.680]  you now to get one of the very last coins in a four coin series, the Teddy Roosevelt

[03:05:52.040 --> 03:06:10.040]  off, use promo code 1776, thank you for your support.
[03:06:10.040 --> 03:06:21.040]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show with Gerald Salente.
[03:06:21.040 --> 03:06:30.720]  Alex Jones show and info wars, and yeah get that bone broth, do everything you can to
[03:06:30.720 --> 03:06:36.560]  support info wars because it's only going to get a lot worse, and they're going to censor
[03:06:36.560 --> 03:06:38.880]  us more and more and more.
[03:06:38.880 --> 03:06:49.120]  So tomorrow, the Fed, well not tomorrow, Wednesday, Wednesday the Fed's going to announce how
[03:06:49.120 --> 03:06:52.520]  much they're going to raise interest rates.
[03:06:52.520 --> 03:07:01.240]  This is very important because the more they raise interest rates, the deeper the economy
[03:07:01.240 --> 03:07:06.960]  is going to sink, and the economy is on a downbeat already.
[03:07:06.960 --> 03:07:16.280]  When you look at the lousy sales, the retail sales in December, oh my God, that's the time
[03:07:16.280 --> 03:07:21.280]  when sales go up, that's when we celebrate Christmas for nothing about the birth of the
[03:07:21.280 --> 03:07:28.960]  Prince of Peace, we only celebrate how high are the sales going up and then go up, there's
[03:07:28.960 --> 03:07:34.200]  a lousy retail, it went up a little bit, nothing.
[03:07:34.200 --> 03:07:40.680]  When you put inflation into it, people are spending more and buying less.
[03:07:40.680 --> 03:07:47.240]  So in looking at the whole situation here, if they raise them 25 basis points, here's
[03:07:47.240 --> 03:07:52.720]  our trend forecast.
[03:07:52.720 --> 03:07:59.400]  The markets are going to shoot much higher, and so too will gold prices because they're
[03:07:59.400 --> 03:08:06.920]  going to pump more cheap dough into there to keep the artificial economy up.
[03:08:06.920 --> 03:08:18.800]  If they raise them 50 basis points and boom, down it goes, yep, and gold will go down too.
[03:08:18.800 --> 03:08:25.040]  Gold prices will go down, commodity prices go down, it will go down, but how long will
[03:08:25.040 --> 03:08:30.680]  gold go down, and again, I'm not selling anything here.
[03:08:30.680 --> 03:08:34.040]  We have no products on the Trends Journal.
[03:08:34.040 --> 03:08:40.720]  Last week I think there was a magazine with 163 pages, no ads, we give you everything we
[03:08:40.720 --> 03:08:47.280]  can, TrendsJournal.com, so I'm not selling gold, I'm telling you how a trend forecast,
[03:08:47.280 --> 03:08:54.200]  gold will then start going up again because the economy is going to go way down, and that's
[03:08:54.200 --> 03:08:59.280]  what happens when things get really bad, you go for that safe haven asset, all you have
[03:08:59.280 --> 03:09:07.760]  to do is go back to, you know, a panic of the way, yeah, how the smart people started
[03:09:07.760 --> 03:09:13.680]  buying gold, knew that things would get worse, because if you believe the government lies,
[03:09:13.680 --> 03:09:23.320]  you believe lies, and speaking of Christmas sales and liars, you know, the only thing
[03:09:23.320 --> 03:09:30.120]  that they talk about during the Christmas season is, you know, Santa Claus has come
[03:09:30.120 --> 03:09:39.560]  into town, and again, you're as a kid, that's all I ever wanted, you know, but anyway, he
[03:09:39.560 --> 03:09:44.280]  knows that you've been sleeping, knows that you're awake, knows that you've been bad
[03:09:44.280 --> 03:09:51.280]  or good, so good for goodness sake, yeah, bad or good, that's what you're called, bad,
[03:09:51.280 --> 03:10:01.040]  you know, so anyway, they don't talk at all about what Christmas is really about, it's
[03:10:01.040 --> 03:10:06.240]  the birth of Jesus Christ, now this isn't a religious sermon, you know, I'm not doing
[03:10:06.240 --> 03:10:13.400]  any of that, I'm just saying what it's about, you know, celebrate Washington's birthday
[03:10:13.400 --> 03:10:27.520]  because it's his birthday, so Jesus Christ is the prince of peace, and banned from the
[03:10:27.520 --> 03:10:33.880]  American media and the Western media is anybody talking about peace, all these little low
[03:10:33.880 --> 03:10:43.840]  life little boys and girls, these little media whores, these prostitutes, all they talk about
[03:10:43.840 --> 03:10:51.040]  is war, war, and how are we gonna beat the Russians, and they bring on these little pieces
[03:10:51.040 --> 03:10:58.200]  of nothing garbage clowns, telling them what's next, oh yeah, hey, bring on more American
[03:10:58.200 --> 03:11:06.320]  generals, yeah, they're general losers that haven't won a war, ask them what's gonna happen,
[03:11:06.320 --> 03:11:13.040]  and our Putin's being defeated, hey, have a little Georgie Bush, the 20 year war in Afghanistan,
[03:11:13.040 --> 03:11:19.240]  where were you little media whores then, where were we, where we always are, Senator, we
[03:11:19.240 --> 03:11:27.080]  bend over and take it, we get paid to put out by our corporate pimps and our government
[03:11:27.080 --> 03:11:33.840]  whore masters, I'm little Donnie Landon, I'm Ann St. Cooper, I'm another piece of crap
[03:11:33.840 --> 03:11:42.840]  on NBC, ABC, CBS, FUN, I can't say the other two letters, but the YOU at the end, nothing
[03:11:42.840 --> 03:11:53.880]  about peace, and speaking of pieces of crap and liars, we got one called Joe Biden, yep,
[03:11:53.880 --> 03:12:02.040]  my religion defines me, defines who I am, that's a quote, my religion defines who I
[03:12:02.040 --> 03:12:13.000]  am, this is what BS Biden said during a presidential debate back in 2012, I've been a practicing
[03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:26.720]  Catholic my whole life, you're not a practicing Catholic, you have whore that prints a piece,
[03:12:26.720 --> 03:12:34.480]  a little clown boy, arrogant president, you supported every whore since you've been in
[03:12:34.480 --> 03:12:39.760]  the government for 60 years, what Catholic you're talking about, hey, I was raised a
[03:12:39.760 --> 03:12:49.160]  Catholic, went to Catholic school, what are you talking about, I know the religion, you're
[03:12:49.160 --> 03:12:58.880]  not a practicing Catholic, you are a practicing murderer, you loved every whore, and how you
[03:12:58.880 --> 03:13:03.480]  put down people that were against it like Scott Ritter saying there were no weapons
[03:13:03.480 --> 03:13:12.640]  of mass destruction, that arrogant you, like all those little arrogant politicians, what
[03:13:12.640 --> 03:13:21.520]  prince of peace are you talking about, you don't support the prince of peace, you support
[03:13:21.520 --> 03:13:30.080]  the devil of war, you're a war whore, and I'll call that to your face, you arrogant
[03:13:30.080 --> 03:13:36.360]  boy who beat the Vietnam War draft, oh yeah, you're a couple of years older than me, right
[03:13:36.360 --> 03:13:43.200]  in the same time, oh all those deferments you got, yeah, oh you were a tough guy, oh don't
[03:13:43.200 --> 03:13:55.080]  worry about my deferments, I'm going to go there to fight, now deferment, I'm not sure
[03:13:55.080 --> 03:14:01.080]  this is appropriate, but there is a tradition in America that the president has what is
[03:14:01.080 --> 03:14:07.240]  called a command coin that he gives to warriors and leaders, and you are the most significant
[03:14:07.240 --> 03:14:16.280]  warrior for peace I've ever met, and so Biden is heard saying to Pope Francis when he met
[03:14:16.280 --> 03:14:24.320]  him back in October 2021, oh prince of peace, what prince warrior for, well the Pope says
[03:14:24.320 --> 03:14:35.640]  a couple of things, what warrior, what warrior, where are all the religions coming out against
[03:14:35.640 --> 03:14:54.600]  war, warmens, other witnesses, Catholics, Episcopalians, Jews, where are you all, where are all the
[03:14:54.600 --> 03:15:02.880]  religions, Biden, my religion defines who I am, my religion defines who I am, I've been
[03:15:02.880 --> 03:15:10.200]  a practicing Catholic my whole life, and is particularly informed by social doctrine,
[03:15:10.200 --> 03:15:15.040]  Catholic school doctrine talks about taking care of those who can't take care of themselves,
[03:15:15.040 --> 03:15:27.520]  people who need help, yeah, you need help, I never miss mass, is part of who I am, yep,
[03:15:27.520 --> 03:15:38.200]  you're a war monger, you're a murderous war monger, you are not a practicing Catholic
[03:15:38.200 --> 03:15:49.560]  as Jesus Christ would see it, and he ain't alone, you're all over the place, we're gonna
[03:15:49.560 --> 03:15:57.520]  be right back, support info wars.
[03:15:57.520 --> 03:16:04.320]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirist in mice, famously said more than
[03:16:04.320 --> 03:16:10.680]  150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated, because the newspapers
[03:16:10.680 --> 03:16:17.040]  kept saying he died decades before he did die, and it's the same PSYOP today, info wars

[03:21:48.600 --> 03:21:53.680]  there's a whole line of these little clowns that are running our lives and ruining them
[03:21:53.680 --> 03:21:55.600]  and telling us what to do.
[03:21:55.600 --> 03:22:01.680]  This is the transcript I got from, I had my staff to, for Senator Lindsey Graham, Richard
[03:22:01.680 --> 03:22:09.600]  Blumenthal, Senators in Sheldon White House, you know, Sheldon Blackhead, Dumbhead, Lindsey
[03:22:09.600 --> 03:22:16.800]  did you come out of the closet, yet Graham and Richard B.S. Blumenthal, that these little
[03:22:16.800 --> 03:22:26.560]  clowns, that these little jerks are in charge of our life, you got to be out of your mind,
[03:22:26.560 --> 03:22:32.200]  what we are, we're good Americans, don't forget to vote, don't forget to vote, repulsive
[03:22:32.200 --> 03:22:41.520]  American, or Democrat, oh, here they are, both on both sides, got them right here, Graham
[03:22:41.520 --> 03:22:47.280]  and the other two clowns were out in Ukraine, this little boy that couldn't fight his way
[03:22:47.280 --> 03:22:54.120]  out of a paper bag, another guy that loves every war, they were over in Ukraine on January
[03:22:54.120 --> 03:23:02.160]  21st, eight days ago, the Congress just thought, this is Graham, the Congress just thought
[03:23:02.160 --> 03:23:10.160]  to authorize 45 million eight billy eight package to help Ukraine expel, President Zelensky
[03:23:10.160 --> 03:23:14.000]  said, we are not asking for charity.
[03:23:14.000 --> 03:23:20.520]  We are asking for an investment, what investment, I want to invest in America, my country is
[03:23:20.520 --> 03:23:26.040]  rotting over here, hey, you've been to LA lately, you like all those homeless people
[03:23:26.040 --> 03:23:37.320]  everywhere, and the people that lost their houses because of the banksters, anyway, American,
[03:23:37.320 --> 03:23:45.280]  and here is what I tell American taxpayers in South Carolina, the reason I am asking
[03:23:45.280 --> 03:23:53.240]  you to help Ukraine is because if you, we do not stop Putin here, he will keep going,
[03:23:53.240 --> 03:24:02.920]  hey, that face, yeah, you're a little younger than me, you don't remember the Vietnam War,
[03:24:02.920 --> 03:24:10.440]  do you, if we don't stop those commies in Vietnam, those dominoes are going to keep
[03:24:10.440 --> 03:24:18.280]  falling, same lying crap coming, spewing out of the mouth the crap heads, like William
[03:24:18.280 --> 03:24:26.320]  F. Buckley, Jr. Yeah, you know what that F is for, yeah, you at the end, that arrogant
[03:24:26.320 --> 03:24:34.240]  guy and all the prostitutes bow down and suck up to him, just like they put clowns like

[03:25:43.800 --> 03:25:50.280]  Lindsey Graham, tax pay cause the reason I'm helping you help going, I also tell the people
[03:25:50.280 --> 03:25:57.200]  of South Carolina that you cannot allow one country to destroy another country and expect
[03:25:57.200 --> 03:26:03.560]  that it will not bother you one day, or you mean paybacks a bitch, huh?
[03:26:03.560 --> 03:26:09.800]  You destroy one country they want to destroy you, hey Lindsey, how about the three and
[03:26:09.800 --> 03:26:15.520]  a half million Americans, Vietnamese that the Americans killed, how about all the Korean
[03:26:15.520 --> 03:26:23.400]  whores, you like that one, hey little Lindsey boy, hey little Lindsey clown, they have you
[03:26:23.400 --> 03:26:33.680]  on all the media because they like to swallow crap, you cannot allow one country to destroy
[03:26:33.680 --> 03:26:41.240]  another country, you mean like George Bush and you and Biden and all the Democrats and
[03:26:41.240 --> 03:26:47.600]  Republicans allowed Bush to do because you don't have the guts to vote to go to war,
[03:26:47.600 --> 03:26:54.040]  they let all president, they do it in what's supposed to be a republic.
[03:26:54.040 --> 03:26:56.480]  How about the Iraq war, huh?
[03:26:56.480 --> 03:27:03.640]  The numbers around between 800 something thousand to a million dead brought to you by one country
[03:27:03.640 --> 03:27:10.200]  invading another, hey little Lindsey boy, how about Afghanistan, oh that only went on for
[03:27:10.200 --> 03:27:19.640]  20 years and they let this, nobody questions this, nobody.
[03:27:19.640 --> 03:27:28.320]  You cannot allow one country to destroy another country, oh unless it's America, we become
[03:27:28.320 --> 03:27:34.680]  the slimy British that our founding fathers overthrew, the son of a sets on the British
[03:27:34.680 --> 03:27:44.080]  umpire, I went on a blind date, some friends for dinner, one of those things, they wanted
[03:27:44.080 --> 03:27:48.760]  me to meet this woman, it was nice we're talking, they were up to the war, I don't talk about
[03:27:48.760 --> 03:27:54.120]  this stuff and I went on to and she said, why, America has to be a world power, what
[03:27:54.120 --> 03:28:00.200]  are you talking about, it's not about business, it's going around the world, oh no, no, if
[03:28:00.200 --> 03:28:07.760]  we don't say listen, we're on a different page, let's just enjoy dinner, world power,
[03:28:07.760 --> 03:28:15.760]  this country is rotting in front of us, the new numbers just came out, 64% of Americans
[03:28:15.760 --> 03:28:23.480]  are living paycheck to paycheck, oh but hey, how about that bill that both the repulsive
[03:28:23.480 --> 03:28:31.080]  Americans and Democrats just passed, 1.7 trillion dollars, oh where's half the dough
[03:28:31.080 --> 03:28:40.840]  going to, the military industrial complex, that's a fact and that's a real number, if
[03:28:40.840 --> 03:28:46.920]  we don't stop this soon, there's going to be no tomorrow, because anybody says they're
[03:28:46.920 --> 03:28:53.920]  a believer in the Catholic church, it's a war manga, you could tell they're going to
[03:28:53.920 --> 03:28:57.160]  take us to hell.

[03:33:57.680 --> 03:34:04.240]  I had this, when I was a kid, you know, I got beat up in the fifth grade, I mean, they're
[03:34:04.240 --> 03:34:12.280]  murderers, that's what we got running our country, murderers and thieves, they steal
[03:34:12.280 --> 03:34:19.560]  our money, a clown Lindsey Graham talking about tax payers, you mean, you just took
[03:34:19.560 --> 03:34:26.200]  my money to get in a military industrial complex, oh, and another slime ball made up federal
[03:34:26.200 --> 03:34:32.080]  income tax, another piece of low life scum, Woodrow Wilson, he had the same piece of scum
[03:34:32.080 --> 03:34:35.760]  that gave us the Federal Reserve, so it could keep stealing our money and be in control
[03:34:35.760 --> 03:34:42.840]  of us, he had a bank's the bandits, oh, that Jesus Christ drove out of the temple, right,
[03:34:42.840 --> 03:34:51.960]  here's our transjournal magazine going back to 2011, didn't change, just the different
[03:34:51.960 --> 03:35:01.840]  names, we got here, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs City, yeah, so this is
[03:35:01.840 --> 03:35:09.760]  Woodrow Wilson stealing our money and taxes and setting us to war, we got, and now they
[03:35:09.760 --> 03:35:17.280]  silence us, if you don't believe in what I'm telling you about an operation warp speed
[03:35:17.280 --> 03:35:24.440]  gene therapy inoculation, then you have no right to think at all, if you don't believe
[03:35:24.440 --> 03:35:29.680]  what we're telling you, we're the government and you will obey what we say, this is not
[03:35:29.680 --> 03:35:36.400]  my America, man, and that's who's in charge of our lives, and that's why you have to support
[03:35:36.400 --> 03:35:42.840]  the Info War, Info Wars is doing it, these people, this team that they have, the quality
[03:35:42.840 --> 03:35:47.600]  of what they put out, they go there every day and see what articles they're looking
[03:35:47.600 --> 03:35:58.440]  at as well, as they go to IRNA, the Iranian, as they go to the times of Israel, Jerusalem
[03:35:58.440 --> 03:36:05.960]  Post, and after another, all over the world, get everybody's views, so anyway, going back
[03:36:05.960 --> 03:36:10.960]  to little lousy Lindsey Graham, the clown boy, and again, how could people be so stupid
[03:36:10.960 --> 03:36:16.440]  to look up to these jerks, because I have to say, I also tell people in South Carolina,
[03:36:16.440 --> 03:36:21.080]  you cannot allow one country to destroy another country, and expect it not to bother you one
[03:36:21.080 --> 03:36:26.760]  day, right, I just said that, yep, like the United States has done, all three of us, Republicans
[03:36:26.760 --> 03:36:33.640]  and Democrats share the same goal for Ukraine, to drive the Russians out of Ukraine, I don't
[03:36:33.640 --> 03:36:40.200]  care, I care less about it, well, we're repulsive kids and Democrats, you do what we tell you,
[03:36:40.200 --> 03:36:47.760]  listen, this is a board of disputes, what's going on for about 300 years, none of my business,
[03:36:47.760 --> 03:36:58.120]  I don't want to get involved in it, well, you have to, okay, he goes, to achieve this
[03:36:58.120 --> 03:37:04.040]  goal, Ukraine military needs tanks, ready for this, I am tired of this, I can't say
[03:37:04.040 --> 03:37:12.360]  the word, but begins with an S, has an H in it, and ends with a T, I am tired of this
[03:37:12.360 --> 03:37:21.640]  S show, surrounding who is going to send tanks, when they are going to send them, world order
[03:37:21.640 --> 03:37:28.840]  is at stake, no, it's not, world order, I don't know, America shouldn't order the world,
[03:37:28.840 --> 03:37:35.240]  there's a dispute going on between these two countries, oh, you forgot about the violation
[03:37:35.240 --> 03:37:39.440]  of the Minsk agreement, oh, you don't remember when the United States overthrew the Democratic
[03:37:39.440 --> 03:37:45.120]  elected government of Viktor Yanukovych in 2014, oh, you don't remember that NATO wouldn't
[03:37:45.120 --> 03:37:50.600]  move one inch further and they had 16 and now they were 30, can't understand this, maybe
[03:37:50.600 --> 03:37:56.600]  you're too stupid, Lindsay, I know you're too stupid, not maybe, I know you're a stupid
[03:37:56.600 --> 03:38:05.840]  little arrogant boy, and I'll call that to your face, freak, war freak that can't fight,
[03:38:05.840 --> 03:38:16.200]  but sending more weapons for other people to go kill, Putin is trying to rewrite the map
[03:38:16.200 --> 03:38:24.720]  of Europe by force of arms, a total lie, he's not trying to rewrite the map of Europe, just
[03:38:24.720 --> 03:38:32.880]  again like the domino theory, it's doing the same thing, to the Germans send tanks to Ukraine,
[03:38:32.880 --> 03:38:38.800]  they need the tanks, is your interest that Putin loses in Ukraine, oh yeah, the Germans
[03:38:38.800 --> 03:38:49.560]  is interested about Russia, huh, you mean the Germans that killed some 25 million Russians
[03:38:49.560 --> 03:38:57.160]  during World War II with Operation Barbarossa, oh, you're telling those Germans to go kill
[03:38:57.160 --> 03:39:04.800]  more Russians, oh, they did a great job, oh, you don't believe me about the 25 million,
[03:39:04.800 --> 03:39:12.000]  look it up, JFK in his speech five months before they killed him, a peace speech at
[03:39:12.000 --> 03:39:21.680]  American University in June of 20, 20, in June of 1963, said some 20 million Russians
[03:39:21.680 --> 03:39:31.800]  were killed, and that their country was destroyed the equivalent of Chicago East, that's Kennedy's
[03:39:31.800 --> 03:39:40.320]  place, Lindsay, Lousy Lindsay, we are going to help international criminal court to have
[03:39:40.320 --> 03:39:44.840]  the capability to bring war crime charges against those who violated Ukraine, hey, how

[03:42:16.640 --> 03:42:31.200]  has just said, particularly about that show, whatever you're saying, yep, the most important
[03:42:31.200 --> 03:42:35.640]  part of the picture is the Republicans and Democrats are coming together in a bipartisan
[03:42:35.640 --> 03:42:40.440]  way to give our whole heart and steadfast support to Ukraine, the repulsivkins and
[03:42:40.440 --> 03:42:48.920]  Democrats are coming together to steal our money and kill more people, don't forget to
[03:42:48.920 --> 03:42:58.320]  vote, don't forget to vote, we're gonna be right back, stay tuned.
[03:42:58.320 --> 03:43:02.840]  I talk a lot about the great successes Info Wars has had, I don't think anybody can deny
[03:43:02.840 --> 03:43:08.520]  it, and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us, but when we talk about the
[03:43:08.520 --> 03:43:13.480]  crew at Info Wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really
[03:43:13.480 --> 03:43:18.680]  have been the MVPs in this fight, and when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Troyer
[03:43:18.680 --> 03:43:23.880]  and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really
[03:43:23.880 --> 03:43:28.000]  just incredible, so for myself, the whole Info Wars crew, I thank you for your past
[03:43:28.000 --> 03:43:33.400]  support, I only encourage you now to realize that Info Wars cannot stay on air if you do
[03:43:33.400 --> 03:43:37.400]  not support us, I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us and that's wonderful,
[03:43:37.400 --> 03:43:42.400]  I keep doing it, but most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsTour.com and you never

[03:43:56.280 --> 03:43:57.600]  take action now.
[03:43:57.600 --> 03:44:02.000]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war and it takes money to
[03:44:02.000 --> 03:44:07.000]  fund an information war, and everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level
[03:44:07.000 --> 03:44:10.960]  and to take the fight to the very tip of the spear and ensure we stand the field in this

[03:49:52.360 --> 03:49:57.280]  Historic fork in the road for this conflict. It is time of maximum danger
[03:49:57.800 --> 03:50:01.320]  But also massive opportunity what maximum danger no that danger to us
[03:50:01.320 --> 03:50:09.320]  Is a border dispute the Russians are on the verge of a major counteroffensive that will be as barbaric and

[03:51:33.960 --> 03:51:40.160]  Opportunity for America to deter and defeat I guess we're at war with Russia, huh? Yeah, you just said it I
[03:51:41.840 --> 03:51:45.760]  Repeat and that is the only acceptable alternative
[03:51:45.760 --> 03:51:57.080]  The counter offensive by Russians and enable Ukraine to win I repeat win. Oh, yeah, go over there and fight
[03:52:00.200 --> 03:52:02.200]  Yep

[03:52:10.040 --> 03:52:12.040]  All the oligarchs accountable. Oh
[03:52:12.040 --> 03:52:15.280]  You mean like the war criminals like Georgie Bush

[03:52:17.280 --> 03:52:19.280]  dick Cheney
[03:52:20.480 --> 03:52:22.400]  Condoleezza Rice
[03:52:22.400 --> 03:52:24.400]  Hitler E. Clinton
[03:52:24.400 --> 03:52:26.680]  Samantha Power Susan Rice
[03:52:31.720 --> 03:52:35.520]  Obama and all your people have voted for those wars
[03:52:35.520 --> 03:52:40.280]  And stole trillions of dollars from us
[03:52:42.280 --> 03:52:48.200]  This is the same Blumenthal when he was running for US Senate in 2010
[03:52:52.000 --> 03:52:54.480]  He listed the New York Times
[03:52:55.320 --> 03:52:59.920]  The New York Times reported that on a couple of occasions he talked inaccurately. He lied
[03:52:59.920 --> 03:53:05.880]  Inaccurately about his Vietnam years Blumenthal listed in the Marine Corps in 1970
[03:53:06.600 --> 03:53:08.600]  Until then he got five deferments
[03:53:09.400 --> 03:53:11.400]  that kept him out of the war and
[03:53:13.640 --> 03:53:17.760]  Because he knew somebody and the family was connected, you know, he was in the Marines
[03:53:17.920 --> 03:53:22.760]  He got a coveted slot in the reserves reduced the chance of his battlefield deployment
[03:53:22.760 --> 03:53:30.560]  Blumenthal went through basic training and served six years in the Washington, DC area and Connecticut
[03:53:30.560 --> 03:53:34.960]  Oh, you're right on the front lines you little lying piece of garbage
[03:53:35.840 --> 03:53:42.280]  Don't forget to vote for him again. All you idiot morons up in Connecticut. Go vote for him
[03:53:44.640 --> 03:53:49.800]  As Connecticut's attorney general a guy has been sucking off the public, you know what all his life
[03:53:49.800 --> 03:53:57.960]  Blumenthal regularly attended Memorial Day parades and other events that recognized soldiers and veterans the New York Times wrote in May 17
[03:53:58.040 --> 03:54:02.040]  2010 that in 2003 Blumenthal had spoken at a rally
[03:54:02.880 --> 03:54:04.880]  supporting the troops overseas and
[03:54:06.240 --> 03:54:08.240]  Blumenthal said quote
[03:54:08.640 --> 03:54:10.640]  When we returned
[03:54:10.920 --> 03:54:12.920]  We saw nothing like this
[03:54:13.720 --> 03:54:18.520]  That was a comparison with soldiers who came back from Vietnam
[03:54:18.520 --> 03:54:22.760]  Blumenthal repeated a similar line in
[03:54:23.440 --> 03:54:25.440]  2007 and a
[03:54:25.640 --> 03:54:28.800]  2008 ceremony for veterans and senior citizens
[03:54:29.840 --> 03:54:31.840]  Blumenthal lied
[03:54:32.120 --> 03:54:33.240]  quote
[03:54:33.240 --> 03:54:40.440]  We have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam
[03:54:41.600 --> 03:54:44.960]  These are the lying little freaks
[03:54:44.960 --> 03:54:50.960]  These are the lying little freaks that are leading us to hell
[03:54:52.040 --> 03:54:57.120]  Stealing our money destroying our lives and it keeps on going
[03:54:58.480 --> 03:55:02.440]  Another little clown of nothing a little boy of nothing
[03:55:03.760 --> 03:55:05.760]  Senator Sheldon Whitehouse
[03:55:07.040 --> 03:55:10.360]  Watching Ukraine makes me proud of being a human being
[03:55:10.360 --> 03:55:16.000]  And inhuman being proud of what?
[03:55:16.560 --> 03:55:19.240]  proud of murder and slaughter and destruction
[03:55:20.440 --> 03:55:24.440]  Are you up in Rhode Island? Can you imagine if all of Rhode Island was destroyed and the people had to leave?
[03:55:26.840 --> 03:55:28.840]  Because nobody wants to talk about peace
[03:55:30.200 --> 03:55:34.680]  We are going to go back to Washington and continue to raise pressure on accountability
[03:55:34.680 --> 03:55:40.320]  Both in an international criminal court. Yeah, bring George Bush, Cheney and all the rest
[03:55:44.560 --> 03:55:46.560]  And there you go
[03:55:48.000 --> 03:55:53.680]  If Putin gets away with this there goes Taiwan that's Lindsey Graham. They're taking us to war
[03:55:54.600 --> 03:56:00.040]  We're at war. The Russians are saying it already if we don't unite for peace. We're gonna die in war

[03:57:28.000 --> 03:57:35.000]  Every gun that is made every warship launch a rocket fire signifies in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed
[03:57:36.000 --> 03:57:38.000]  Those who are cold and not clothe

[03:58:46.000 --> 03:58:51.000]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist
[03:58:52.000 --> 03:58:57.000]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics not just in America but the world
[03:58:58.000 --> 03:59:03.000]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war
[03:59:03.000 --> 03:59:06.000]  But I don't deserve the credit. Yes, I've persevered
[03:59:07.000 --> 03:59:12.000]  But the listeners and viewers who support info wars are the real reason we've had the success
[03:59:13.000 --> 03:59:17.000]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new world order we've ever had
[03:59:18.000 --> 03:59:22.000]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon
[03:59:23.000 --> 03:59:27.000]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight
[03:59:28.000 --> 03:59:31.000]  And to continue in the efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them
[03:59:31.000 --> 03:59:38.000]  God bless you all. I salute you. I thank you and I beg you to intensify what you're doing now
[03:59:38.000 --> 04:00:01.000]  Because we are over the target and history is happening. The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all.
