[00:00.000 --> 00:11.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, December 4th, the year is 2020, we are 48 days out.
[00:11.680 --> 00:18.560]  From the inauguration of Donald John Trump, if we fight back, the evidence is now red-handed
[00:18.560 --> 00:25.960]  in all five states with the red-handed video of the illegal sequential ballots devastating.
[00:25.960 --> 00:30.200]  Donald Trump can get his hands on those, it's game over.
[00:30.200 --> 00:35.720]  And yes, Chinese communist fingerprints aren't just all over it, they literally run and finance
[00:35.720 --> 00:38.560]  basically own dominion.
[00:38.560 --> 00:40.080]  We have been shanghite.
[00:40.080 --> 00:41.640]  What is shanghite?
[00:41.640 --> 00:47.120]  To force someone to join a ship, lacking a full crew by drugging them or using other
[00:47.120 --> 00:49.920]  underhanded means.
[00:49.920 --> 00:57.720]  Because the communist Chinese didn't invent this, the Chinese are well-known in thousand-year-old
[00:57.720 --> 01:02.160]  reports of grabbing Japanese and others making them slaves on ships.
[01:02.160 --> 01:05.800]  And of course that went on in other parts of the world, but we do know it was the communist
[01:05.800 --> 01:10.600]  Chinese that would slave their own people and they have shanghite our election.
[01:10.600 --> 01:12.160]  We must now take it back.
[01:12.160 --> 01:16.320]  Here's part of the powerful John Bowne report that will air in the fourth hour that's posted
[01:16.320 --> 01:22.280]  Band-Aid video, this report only gets out if you get it out.
[01:22.280 --> 01:27.320]  You must resist the globalists, you must see no to their takeover.
[01:27.320 --> 01:32.240]  You must not go along with their new world order.
[01:32.240 --> 01:37.320]  Elections shanghite by the iron triangle, here's the beginning of the report.
[01:37.320 --> 01:43.880]  The SEC documents shining a blinding light on the architects of the 2020 election fraud
[01:43.880 --> 01:48.960]  are available for anyone to see, but the mainstream media won't touch it with a 10-foot
[01:48.960 --> 01:49.960]  pole.
[01:49.960 --> 01:51.920]  It would be career suicide.
[01:51.920 --> 01:56.440]  Conspiracy theories have exploded online during the pandemic and in the days leading
[01:56.440 --> 02:01.280]  up to the election, researchers say voters are being bombarded with false narratives
[02:01.280 --> 02:04.120]  intended to cause fear and disorder.
[02:04.120 --> 02:09.520]  Election interference and targeted disinformation campaigns on voter fraud are a real threat
[02:09.520 --> 02:11.520]  in the upcoming U.S. election.
[02:11.520 --> 02:14.840]  Voter fraud is extremely rare in the United States, that's what all the experts say, that's
[02:14.840 --> 02:16.920]  what all the historical studies show.
[02:16.920 --> 02:22.120]  Barr encouraged federal prosecutors to pursue what he called substantial allegations of
[02:22.120 --> 02:26.840]  voter fraud, even though there was no evidence of such in this election.
[02:26.840 --> 02:30.280]  You know, voter fraud is a lot like Al Capone's vault.
[02:30.280 --> 02:35.120]  Lots of hype, but not much, you know, actually in there.
[02:35.120 --> 02:41.320]  And everyone knows Congress is a useless theatrical husk of its former founding father, idealistic
[02:41.320 --> 02:42.320]  self.
[02:42.320 --> 02:48.480]  Those documents detail a $400 million acquisition of the Dominion Software Company by the Communist
[02:48.480 --> 02:55.160]  Chinese via the Swiss company UBS through a U.S. private equity group known as Staples
[02:55.160 --> 03:00.880]  Street Capital, which ultimately leads to the nefarious multinational Carlisle Group.
[03:00.880 --> 03:05.240]  The Carlisle Group personifies Eisenhower's ominous warning.
[03:05.240 --> 03:11.800]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
[03:11.800 --> 03:16.400]  whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex.
[03:16.400 --> 03:22.360]  The Carlisle Group was founded in 1987 at the Carlisle Hotel in New York City by Bill
[03:22.360 --> 03:26.480]  Conway, Daniel Dianne Yellow, and David Rubenstein.
[03:26.480 --> 03:31.240]  The Carlisle Group operates out of the District of Corruption in our nation's capital with
[03:31.240 --> 03:39.240]  31 offices on six continents, occupying a unique reality at the highest levels in what is known
[03:39.240 --> 03:45.040]  as the Iron Triangle, a world dominated by politics, industry, and the military.
[03:45.040 --> 03:51.400]  A group of a business built around defense and military that becomes so large and so
[03:51.400 --> 03:58.880]  powerful that it's actually able to influence the politics of war.
[03:58.880 --> 04:04.720]  In my direction, elements of the 82nd Airborne Division, as well as key units of the United
[04:04.720 --> 04:11.360]  States Air Force, are arriving today to take up defensive positions in Saudi Arabia.
[04:11.360 --> 04:16.800]  The Carlisle Group pioneered the shadowy world of conflict of interest disguised as
[04:16.800 --> 04:20.960]  nepotism as a means to broker deals with foreign interests.
[04:20.960 --> 04:25.600]  I have said that it's the worst kind of conflict of interest, particularly when your son is
[04:25.600 --> 04:26.800]  the president of the United States.
[04:26.800 --> 04:30.240]  All right, that's just the first three and a half minutes of the seven and a half minute
[04:30.240 --> 04:31.240]  report.
[04:31.240 --> 04:36.120]  It's a very powerful election to Shanghai by the Iron Triangle.
[04:36.120 --> 04:40.240]  The Chi Coms, the corrupt military industrial complex, and the foreign banks.
[04:40.240 --> 04:43.720]  And Trump's pulling us out of all these wars, and they're not going to put up with it.
[04:43.720 --> 04:45.560]  And the left is so angry at Trump.
[04:45.560 --> 04:47.280]  They love death camps in China.
[04:47.280 --> 04:48.400]  They love pedophilia.
[04:48.400 --> 04:52.280]  They are Satanists scum that hate this country, and they're going to burn in hell.
[04:52.280 --> 04:58.960]  Well, they're right back, stay with us.
[04:58.960 --> 05:03.960]  Most of the world submitted to the unconstitutional criminal lockdowns directed by the Communist
[05:03.960 --> 05:06.320]  Chinese and the United Nations.
[05:06.320 --> 05:11.720]  And now because the slaves have proven themselves to be subservient, the worst Australian models
[05:11.720 --> 05:15.800]  of complete lockdowns you can't even leave your house for months and months are being
[05:15.800 --> 05:16.800]  announced.
[05:16.800 --> 05:21.720]  And in Germany, the police are using giant armored tanks with water cannons to blast
[05:21.720 --> 05:25.880]  men, women, and children that protest the fact that Merkel, the dictator, has put them
[05:25.880 --> 05:26.880]  under her control.
[05:26.880 --> 05:27.880]  That's right.
[05:27.880 --> 05:32.560]  She's been rigging elections for years and years, and the same thing is coming here to
[05:32.560 --> 05:33.560]  the United States.
[05:33.560 --> 05:34.880]  This is world government.
[05:34.880 --> 05:39.640]  In Philadelphia, they've announced four people or more seen together will be arrested.
[05:39.640 --> 05:41.720]  They're announcing the Christmas is canceled.
[05:41.720 --> 05:46.120]  This is what the Communist takeover looks like, to bankrupt you, to take red of all your due
[05:46.120 --> 05:51.720]  process and absolutely transform the world into a prison planet.
[05:51.720 --> 05:55.440]  How long have we warned you about this, but you can fight back.
[05:55.440 --> 05:57.080]  America is the last bastion.
[05:57.080 --> 06:18.400]  We are live, we are fighting back, we are America, coming to you from deep in the heart
[06:18.400 --> 06:19.400]  of Texas.
[06:19.400 --> 06:20.400]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[06:20.400 --> 06:24.640]  I'm your host Alex Jones, it is Friday, December 4th.
[06:24.640 --> 06:25.640]  The year is 2020.
[06:25.640 --> 06:29.800]  We are 47 days out from the inauguration.
[06:29.800 --> 06:32.800]  All right.
[06:32.800 --> 06:37.400]  I have told you that Trump had about a 20% chance in the last three weeks since this
[06:37.400 --> 06:41.960]  fraud unfolded to prove it to the American people and to override this corruption because
[06:41.960 --> 06:46.600]  the gaslighting and the mass hoax and the incredible censorship by Big Tech and the
[06:46.600 --> 06:50.520]  control corporate media is so unbelievable.
[06:50.520 --> 06:58.080]  But thanks to the grace of God and all these wonderful men and women, black, white, Hispanic,
[06:58.080 --> 07:06.640]  old, young, Indian Americans, Native Americans, Indians from India that are Americans, Chinese
[07:06.640 --> 07:12.600]  Americans, black Americans, all Hispanic Americans, all telling the same stories of
[07:12.600 --> 07:16.240]  the organized fraud in those key five states.
[07:16.240 --> 07:19.640]  They did it everywhere else too.
[07:19.640 --> 07:24.640]  We have a lawyer coming in studio later who went and pole watched and caught them engaged
[07:24.640 --> 07:28.360]  in criminal activity in Travis County.
[07:28.360 --> 07:34.760]  The county clerk has been caught over and over against stealing elections.
[07:34.760 --> 07:38.040]  This woman, when she called the police, she was arrested.
[07:38.040 --> 07:39.040]  But guess what?
[07:39.040 --> 07:41.480]  She had hidden video and got it all.
[07:41.480 --> 07:45.120]  People say, why are you worried about Travis County?
[07:45.120 --> 07:46.120]  It's totally leftist.
[07:46.120 --> 07:47.120]  Why are you worried about California?
[07:47.120 --> 07:49.000]  We'll never get it back.
[07:49.000 --> 07:55.000]  People didn't vote for the Democrats out in California, but I'm digressing.
[07:55.000 --> 07:58.840]  People say, well, why would they have fraud in California?
[07:58.840 --> 08:00.640]  Because it's been fraud.
[08:00.640 --> 08:03.280]  That's how they took it over.
[08:03.280 --> 08:06.120]  It's fraud in all the blue cities in Texas.
[08:06.120 --> 08:09.080]  Once you go Democrat, you never get out of it because of the fraud.
[08:09.080 --> 08:14.400]  They are an organized criminal group that believes the country shouldn't exist.
[08:14.400 --> 08:20.720]  Let me give you the big news, let me give you the big news here.
[08:20.720 --> 08:27.280]  I spent hours this morning and hours last night at infowars.com and at gatewaypundit.com
[08:27.280 --> 08:34.640]  and at nationalfile.com and very little time on Breitbart because they are really starting
[08:34.640 --> 08:36.400]  to drop the ball and turn against Trump.
[08:36.400 --> 08:37.400]  Very disgusting.
[08:37.400 --> 08:39.320]  But I guess that Mercer Bunny must be good.
[08:39.320 --> 08:40.320]  Very sad.
[08:40.320 --> 08:46.080]  And I like Breitbart.
[08:46.080 --> 08:50.080]  One of these stories should turn the whole election over because it's so organized.
[08:50.080 --> 08:56.080]  But there's hundreds with video in dozens of cases of the fraud.
[08:56.080 --> 09:01.120]  People looking over their shoulder, kicking everybody out, saying a water pipe broke.
[09:01.120 --> 09:02.120]  That's bad enough.
[09:02.120 --> 09:03.120]  That should overturn it.
[09:03.120 --> 09:08.480]  Then they pull out all the black crates from under the table and look like Sylvester when
[09:08.480 --> 09:13.640]  he's caught with Tweety Bird in his mouth.
[09:13.640 --> 09:19.120]  And start running the sons of bitches and then it turns out they're all Biden votes.
[09:19.120 --> 09:21.240]  And then it gets worse.
[09:21.240 --> 09:27.600]  Same stuff came out in Michigan with the witnesses, the video, everything, just like Georgia.
[09:27.600 --> 09:33.080]  And then you've got witnesses that were there who were testifying, who were professionals.
[09:33.080 --> 09:43.160]  Very credible, saying the ballots were all in sequential order, the numbers, impossible.
[09:43.160 --> 09:49.040]  Mailed out, came back all in the same order together.
[09:49.040 --> 09:52.880]  China chartered all these flights in the days before and the days after into the key areas
[09:52.880 --> 09:56.680]  because there's records of the flights coming in, funded by the Chinese government.
[09:56.680 --> 10:00.640]  And then you even see the Chinese men looking like state intelligence operatives.
[10:00.640 --> 10:08.960]  And they've got the look of bureaucrats, spies, going in with dollies in Georgia and in Michigan
[10:08.960 --> 10:14.000]  in the dead of night when even the county clerk shouldn't have a swipe card that authorizes
[10:14.000 --> 10:16.040]  them to get in.
[10:16.040 --> 10:20.280]  Because that's supposed to be locked up when, when, when, when, when it's closed.
[10:20.280 --> 10:25.240]  I mean, they landed in the fricking aircraft folks and went right in there with their swipe
[10:25.240 --> 10:27.880]  guards and Shanghai that baby.
[10:27.880 --> 10:31.920]  They're under Chinese military communist attack.
[10:31.920 --> 10:38.800]  So I'll tell you, Joe Biden, one way or another, is going to get removed from office and even
[10:38.800 --> 10:40.400]  forces his way in there.
[10:40.400 --> 10:43.400]  And they've screwed the pooch and they've gotten caught.
[10:43.400 --> 10:56.200]  And I can tell you at a core level, a core level that the New World Order is in deep
[10:56.200 --> 11:01.880]  trouble and they're never going to get away with what they're pulling.
[11:01.880 --> 11:09.480]  I have stack after stack, after video, after video, not just of the eyewitnesses, not just
[11:09.480 --> 11:15.640]  of their testimonies, but of the video that they're testifying about.
[11:15.640 --> 11:22.200]  I was watching the Georgia hearings last night as people were brought to tears.
[11:22.200 --> 11:24.240]  It was like out of a few good men or something.
[11:24.240 --> 11:26.400]  It was so epic, but it was so real.
[11:26.400 --> 11:30.160]  How they witnessed the ballot stuffing and the criminal activity and the people taking
[11:30.160 --> 11:34.480]  the same ballots and running them over and over again, giggling and snickering and, and
[11:34.480 --> 11:38.880]  just all the criminal activity and, and trying to throw the poll watchers out and all the
[11:38.880 --> 11:44.920]  same stories from Austin, Texas, where I live, we have the video, Atlanta, Georgia, we have
[11:44.920 --> 11:51.520]  the video, Detroit, Michigan, we have the video, Phoenix, Arizona.
[11:51.520 --> 11:56.840]  We have it, unbelievable.
[11:56.840 --> 12:01.800]  And then you got Joe Biden saying, we have the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud
[12:01.800 --> 12:03.800]  organization ever created.
[12:03.800 --> 12:07.560]  Oh, he just doesn't know what he's saying.
[12:07.560 --> 12:17.080]  You know, he's so senile now, he just says it.
[12:17.080 --> 12:20.320]  Like when he declared himself that Victor, the Saturday after the election five days
[12:20.320 --> 12:25.440]  later, he turns around, he's rude to his wife, he goes, where's Hunter?
[12:25.440 --> 12:28.880]  And then Hunter comes up and he kisses him and then he starts kissing the baby on the
[12:28.880 --> 12:29.880]  lips.
[12:29.880 --> 12:33.840]  And if he's just flaunting it, he might as well just piss right in your face.
[12:33.840 --> 12:41.120]  He's just flaunting and rubbing it in that skeletal demon.
[12:41.120 --> 12:45.040]  So I don't know how this is going to end for me and you don't know how your life's going
[12:45.040 --> 12:46.040]  to end.
[12:46.040 --> 12:47.040]  Only God knows that.
[12:47.040 --> 12:54.320]  But look at this and I can tell you, there's no way they get away with this, even if they
[12:54.320 --> 12:57.400]  try to certify it and go forward.
[12:57.400 --> 13:01.480]  That's why you know how members of Congress moving to go to the electors and the legislatures
[13:01.480 --> 13:05.200]  as they should have been doing three weeks ago and saying, you've got to decertify this
[13:05.200 --> 13:10.280]  and you've got to have investigations and they're going to have to do what Pelosi threatened
[13:10.280 --> 13:16.800]  to do with the 20th Amendment, they thought if they thought if they had lost, they were
[13:16.800 --> 13:19.920]  going to contest it, remember?
[13:19.920 --> 13:21.800]  And they were going to push it back to the States.
[13:21.800 --> 13:22.800]  Remember that?
[13:22.800 --> 13:26.600]  They were able to freeze it that night, bring in so many frauds and once they got over the
[13:26.600 --> 13:32.120]  top because they'd been destroying Trump balance, we now know that was the directive.
[13:32.120 --> 13:33.440]  Go through the mailboxes, go through the mail.
[13:33.440 --> 13:36.800]  If you find a Trump one, rip them in half, tear them up, throw them in the trash.
[13:36.800 --> 13:38.440]  That's what they were just found everywhere.
[13:38.440 --> 13:40.040]  It's always Trump, always Trump.
[13:40.040 --> 13:44.640]  I mean, people found like dumpsters where it'd be like 300 plus Trump things and like
[13:44.640 --> 13:45.640]  one Biden.
[13:45.640 --> 13:50.920]  I mean, it's just insane and it's all right here.
[13:50.920 --> 13:53.960]  In fact, I said 300.
[13:53.960 --> 14:02.040]  In one case, there were 2,000 Trump votes just hidden in one county in Georgia.
[14:02.040 --> 14:06.160]  I mean, it's the same thing in Michigan.
[14:06.160 --> 14:10.760]  This is like saying you go to the ocean, you say there's no fish in it.
[14:10.760 --> 14:13.560]  Like, there are no fish in the ocean.
[14:13.560 --> 14:16.000]  There is no election fraud, no proof of it.
[14:16.000 --> 14:17.000]  It's never happened.
[14:17.000 --> 14:18.080]  It never goes on.
[14:18.080 --> 14:20.040]  No one's ever seen it before.
[14:20.040 --> 14:27.440]  It's like, I don't know if it's true that La Cosa Nostra, the mafia had Jagger Hoover
[14:27.440 --> 14:28.440]  dressed up like a woman.
[14:28.440 --> 14:29.520]  I don't know if he was gay.
[14:29.520 --> 14:30.960]  I really don't care.
[14:30.960 --> 14:35.680]  The point is, is that he did say that the mafia did not exist.
[14:35.680 --> 14:36.680]  Okay.
[14:36.680 --> 14:44.800]  He gave testimony in the 40s and early 50s that the mafia did not exist.
[14:44.800 --> 14:45.800]  Okay.
[14:45.800 --> 14:52.280]  Now, that is a less ridiculous statement and it's totally ridiculous.
[14:52.280 --> 14:57.880]  Totally ridiculous than saying there's no election or voter fraud.
[14:57.880 --> 15:03.480]  Again, that's like saying cows don't go move or the sun didn't come up this morning or
[15:03.480 --> 15:11.080]  mama don't love her baby and they just sit there and they do this and it's not going
[15:11.080 --> 15:12.080]  to work.
[15:12.080 --> 15:16.120]  There's a total loss of confidence in the system, a total loss of confidence in the
[15:16.120 --> 15:20.880]  mainstream media, a total loss of confidence and people are pissed.
[15:20.880 --> 15:22.080]  I go to the grocery store.
[15:22.080 --> 15:27.040]  I go to a doctor's appointment and I mean, you know, used to some, oh, Alex, say we like
[15:27.040 --> 15:28.040]  you.
[15:28.040 --> 15:31.760]  I have black people, brown people, Asian people, old people, gay people, straight people.
[15:31.760 --> 15:34.280]  You know, I go into the dental appointment and they're like, oh Alex, you're right about
[15:34.280 --> 15:35.280]  everything.
[15:35.280 --> 15:36.280]  Oh, we think you were wrong.
[15:36.280 --> 15:38.360]  I mean, again, I'm just a bellwether.
[15:38.360 --> 15:39.360]  I'm a gauge.
[15:39.360 --> 15:43.440]  The globalists have screwed the pooch and now they're coming with forced inoculations
[15:43.440 --> 15:46.880]  and ID cards and world government and saying, oh, there's no side effects.
[15:46.880 --> 15:48.000]  No one gets sick from it.
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.720]  When the damn study say 80%, get super sick when you take the COVID vaccine.
[15:51.720 --> 15:54.160]  This is a crazy cold of lunatics.
[15:54.160 --> 15:56.920]  What the hell's going on here?
[15:56.920 --> 16:03.960]  You can watch a factory of robots being controlled by wireless internet commands.
[16:03.960 --> 16:07.520]  But if you were a person just 200 years ago and you saw that, you think it was magic.
[16:07.520 --> 16:11.840]  You wouldn't even know really what the machines were or what was controlling them.
[16:11.840 --> 16:16.560]  So for that person, it would be spiritual or it would be something of a spirit.
[16:16.560 --> 16:20.960]  And it's similar to how ducks and butterflies and many other species of animal know how to
[16:20.960 --> 16:24.720]  fly thousands and thousands of miles back to the exact place where they were born.
[16:24.720 --> 16:28.760]  They're following magnetic lines, they have magnetic cells in their brains.
[16:28.760 --> 16:32.360]  We now know side effects are going on, but there's even a lot more than that.
[16:32.360 --> 16:35.720]  So when we talk about the spirit, we're talking about all the dark matter.
[16:35.720 --> 16:38.520]  We're talking about all the things you don't understand, but we know it's there.
[16:38.520 --> 16:42.640]  And just like you can have a bunch of robots working off a wireless system, that's what's
[16:42.640 --> 16:47.280]  going on with this satanic transmission that's working through people.
[16:47.280 --> 16:52.440]  And that's how this entity behind it all is able to direct it because it is a consciousness
[16:52.440 --> 16:55.000]  manipulated in the space time continuum.
[17:22.440 --> 17:40.200]  It's all there discounted and with promo code PATRIOT at checkout, you get an additional

[17:58.480 --> 18:26.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:26.040 --> 18:40.400]  All right, here's what's going down, ladies and gentlemen on the Alex Jones show on this
[18:40.400 --> 18:42.640]  Friday edition.
[18:42.640 --> 18:48.040]  Tom Papert and National File have been up all night, many nights the last 30 days or
[18:48.040 --> 18:54.400]  so and they have really broken a lot of incredible information working with others and so he'll
[18:54.400 --> 18:56.280]  be joining us.
[18:56.280 --> 19:00.000]  The evidence is so overwhelming, Governor Kemp, who's been dragging his heels, calls
[19:00.000 --> 19:06.600]  on Georgia SOS to conduct signature audit of ballots and says it needs to be done now.
[19:06.600 --> 19:12.480]  And they've already done spot checks, they know that Biden will completely lose even
[19:12.480 --> 19:16.280]  if they do ballot checks in a couple counties over total fraud.
[19:16.280 --> 19:21.280]  Many of them don't even have a signature on them, they don't even have the proper addresses,
[19:21.280 --> 19:25.200]  they were just dumped in mailboxes.
[19:25.200 --> 19:29.480]  So the wheels are coming off, that's just one area where it's blowing a gasket, where
[19:29.480 --> 19:34.560]  there's proof and where Trump is so close.
[19:34.560 --> 19:39.280]  That's coming up next segment and all the footage, Georgia Secretary of State, partially
[19:39.280 --> 19:44.160]  Ben's knee, knowledge his ballots were counted unlawfully and in secret because the footage
[19:44.160 --> 19:47.320]  has now been leaked.
[19:47.320 --> 19:57.040]  Governor and daughter team, it's all coming up next segment.
[19:57.040 --> 20:01.000]  But let me give you the bad news and we knew this was coming.
[20:01.000 --> 20:07.720]  In Europe, in Canada, in Australia and now in the United States, they are proposing forced
[20:07.720 --> 20:12.920]  inoculation of children without parental consent and it gets worse.
[20:12.920 --> 20:17.800]  In the UK and now in Canada, chief medical officer, that's our Fauci here, who's going
[20:17.800 --> 20:20.560]  to stay on with Biden if they should get in.
[20:20.560 --> 20:25.440]  Chief medical officer says Canadians who refuse vaccine won't have freedom to move around,
[20:25.440 --> 20:26.440]  close quote.
[20:26.440 --> 20:28.360]  That video is coming up in a moment.
[20:28.360 --> 20:33.680]  So let that burn in, folks, doesn't protect you, has all these horrible side effects and
[20:33.680 --> 20:37.040]  I have Pfizer admitting this really won't even protect you from COVID and it won't
[20:37.040 --> 20:39.040]  even stop you spreading it.
[20:39.040 --> 20:43.040]  But we're just doing it and we skipped the animal trials and we had a bunch of problems
[20:43.040 --> 20:48.120]  in the human trials, but the people getting sick and the people dying, it's worth it.
[20:48.120 --> 20:51.120]  Wow.
[20:51.120 --> 20:53.000]  This is like a kamikaze action.
[20:53.000 --> 20:56.880]  It's like somebody's got a gun to these people's heads.
[20:56.880 --> 20:59.880]  You will depopulate your planet or we will destroy it all.
[20:59.880 --> 21:01.280]  Yes, of course, Lob.
[21:01.280 --> 21:05.200]  I mean, if I was a military tactician, I'd say this doesn't make sense.
[21:05.200 --> 21:07.800]  It's like aliens have a gun to their heads to do this.
[21:07.800 --> 21:09.160]  This is not going to be popular.
[21:09.160 --> 21:10.160]  This is illegal.
[21:10.160 --> 21:11.160]  It doesn't help people.
[21:11.160 --> 21:12.760]  And I'm not even saying it's aliens.
[21:12.760 --> 21:22.520]  I'm saying the Bible says it's an alien, a fallen one, wants to kill, steal, and destroy.
[21:22.520 --> 21:28.240]  So I'm going to get into all this next hour, but it is an insane nightmare stack.
[21:28.240 --> 21:33.000]  The lockdowns, the tracking, the martial law, the power over your body, the mask over your
[21:33.000 --> 21:40.080]  face, the DNA altering GMO Franken mutagen that they, you know, that's like every old
[21:40.080 --> 21:45.080]  comic book where the mad scientist injects himself with weird DNA and then mutates.
[21:45.080 --> 21:49.320]  That actually is what this does.
[21:49.320 --> 21:55.320]  It's so fricking crazy.
[21:55.320 --> 21:57.960]  And what they do is, oh, it's going to be mandatory.
[21:57.960 --> 21:58.960]  Actually probably not.
[21:58.960 --> 21:59.960]  Well, you have to be mandatory.
[21:59.960 --> 22:00.960]  Probably not.
[22:00.960 --> 22:01.960]  Yeah, it is.
[22:01.960 --> 22:05.600]  You have to issue the cards here in the United States of the UK.
[22:05.600 --> 22:07.920]  And yeah, a lot of businesses will demand the cards.
[22:07.920 --> 22:13.600]  And I know so many people that were in the Foreign Service who were told to take vaccines
[22:13.600 --> 22:18.120]  in the military and who got so sick from them, medical doctors tell them, don't ever take
[22:18.120 --> 22:19.120]  another vaccine.
[22:19.120 --> 22:23.280]  It could kill you because it's like being stung by a bee and you get an allergic response
[22:23.280 --> 22:25.360]  where you get an allergic thing to peanuts.
[22:25.360 --> 22:30.280]  Once you're allergic to it, it'll kill you the next time.
[22:30.280 --> 22:34.480]  All the neurological disorders and all of it, they just sit there and go Facebook, Google
[22:34.480 --> 22:36.880]  and Apple and Twitter will not allow this info.
[22:36.880 --> 22:42.560]  Try to send out a medical journal report about people dying in the trials and they'll block
[22:42.560 --> 22:43.560]  it.
[22:43.560 --> 22:49.720]  I mean, they're making a move with violence, trying to block consumer advocacy, but then
[22:49.720 --> 22:53.280]  admitting in the fine print, oh, this doesn't protect you and we have liability protection
[22:53.280 --> 22:54.280]  on the news.
[22:54.280 --> 22:55.280]  It's totally effective.
[22:55.280 --> 22:56.600]  It'll fix everything.
[22:56.600 --> 22:58.720]  It's wonderful.
[22:58.720 --> 23:01.160]  No question any of it.
[23:01.160 --> 23:07.000]  Oh, vaccine cards and second dose reminders on your app, on your phone or part of Warp
[23:07.000 --> 23:09.320]  Speeds Immunization Plan.
[23:09.320 --> 23:12.560]  And again, Trump did this to try to take control from the globalists to try to get the economy
[23:12.560 --> 23:16.800]  open, but they said, oh, no, no, no, no, no, Trump's going to be gone and we're never
[23:16.800 --> 23:20.040]  going to reopen the economy and you're going to take the shots and you're never taking
[23:20.040 --> 23:21.040]  the mask off.
[23:21.040 --> 23:22.040]  See how it works?
[23:22.040 --> 23:23.040]  You see how it works?
[23:23.040 --> 23:26.680]  Oh, it might as is at least 100 days.
[23:26.680 --> 23:30.960]  You know, we're already six, seven, eight months into got to wear the mask, got to wear
[23:30.960 --> 23:31.960]  the mask illegally.
[23:31.960 --> 23:36.160]  Remember at first, well, if you've got asthma or a psychological problem, you don't have
[23:36.160 --> 23:37.680]  to, but then no one honors that.
[23:37.680 --> 23:42.920]  They just have to legally say that.
[23:42.920 --> 23:43.920]  And so that's how they're doing this.
[23:43.920 --> 23:44.920]  That's how they're rolling this out.
[23:44.920 --> 23:47.000]  And now they're like, well, actually, everybody has to.
[23:47.000 --> 23:50.080]  And now you got to wear two masks and you got to wear goggles and you got to wear a space
[23:50.080 --> 23:51.080]  suit.
[23:51.080 --> 23:53.840]  You got to wear them.
[23:53.840 --> 23:55.240]  This is their authoritarian rollout.
[23:55.240 --> 23:56.360]  This is their takeover model.
[23:56.360 --> 24:01.040]  And then Klaus Schwab and Ted Turner and Bill Gates admit it's part of a planetary reset
[24:01.040 --> 24:05.760]  to make you live with less, but it says it'll make you so much happier once you're sick
[24:05.760 --> 24:06.880]  and dying.
[24:06.880 --> 24:11.680]  These are literal exterminist that said they want to depopulate you.
[24:11.680 --> 24:15.160]  All of the things he's missing is a Persian cat in his lap.
[24:15.160 --> 24:18.560]  I mean, you would cast him for James Bond villain blow felt.
[24:18.560 --> 24:19.560]  You would.
[24:19.560 --> 24:24.040]  That's because characters like that by Ian Fleming of MI six are based on the real
[24:24.040 --> 24:26.400]  Bilderberg group.
[24:26.400 --> 24:28.960]  And who do you think was there before him?
[24:28.960 --> 24:30.040]  Somebody just like him.
[24:30.040 --> 24:33.560]  They all look like Dr. Evil.
[24:33.560 --> 24:35.400]  Why does Dr. Evil look like that?
[24:35.400 --> 24:39.440]  Because Hollywood knows these people look like.
[24:39.440 --> 24:40.920]  Where's this many me?
[24:40.920 --> 24:45.760]  Does that be Brennan or Clapper?
[24:45.760 --> 24:46.760]  You're going to take it.
[24:46.760 --> 24:48.880]  You're going to drink sewage and eat weeds.
[24:48.880 --> 24:53.680]  He said that last week, the new diets will be sewage, bugs and weeds.
[24:53.680 --> 24:54.680]  I'm not kidding.
[24:54.680 --> 24:55.680]  You have the clip.
[24:55.680 --> 24:56.680]  It says it in German.
[24:56.680 --> 25:05.480]  There are some new diets and drink sewage and weeds and, uh, but don't worry, tampons
[25:05.480 --> 25:06.480]  will be free.
[25:06.480 --> 25:07.480]  Yes, he said that too.
[25:07.480 --> 25:09.720]  I mean, yes.
[25:09.720 --> 25:13.120]  So that's Goldfinger.
[25:13.120 --> 25:18.400]  He's more of a corrupt industrialist pull up, uh, the head of specter in from Russia
[25:18.400 --> 25:19.400]  with love.
[25:19.400 --> 25:22.680]  I don't think I ever even show his face, but just pull up James Bond, pull up Dr. Evil.
[25:22.680 --> 25:23.680]  All right.
[25:23.680 --> 25:24.680]  I got a digress here.
[25:24.680 --> 25:29.120]  If you don't fund our operation, if you don't do your Christmas shopping with us, we're
[25:29.120 --> 25:34.440]  not funded by Klaus Schwab, our Jean-Claude Junker, the Nazi air of the entire Supreme
[25:34.440 --> 25:36.080]  Empire of the Nazis.
[25:36.080 --> 25:39.680]  Uh, we're not funded by them that funds George Soros.
[25:39.680 --> 25:41.320]  He's funded by the Supreme Nazi rulers.
[25:41.320 --> 25:42.320]  I'm not joking.
[25:42.320 --> 25:49.520]  Look it up and I'm funded by you and I need you to get high quality products.
[25:49.520 --> 25:55.640]  You need the products that are info or store.com, prostagard has the D three, the zinc and the
[25:55.640 --> 25:59.360]  salt palmetto and then a bunch of other vitamins and minerals that are essential.
[25:59.360 --> 26:00.360]  This sold out real quick.
[26:00.360 --> 26:02.760]  People go, wow, this is like the best formula for your immune system.
[26:02.760 --> 26:03.760]  Exactly.
[26:03.760 --> 26:05.520]  And the salt palmetto is great for women too.
[26:05.520 --> 26:09.720]  It's just been found in the FDA has had to admit that, okay, medical doctors should
[26:09.720 --> 26:14.360]  prescribe salt palmetto as a regular daily regimen for your prostate because it literally
[26:14.360 --> 26:17.320]  just basically 99% chance it stops the cancer.
[26:17.320 --> 26:19.640]  Depending on what study you look at, it's very high numbers.
[26:19.640 --> 26:24.520]  Well, I'm not advertising this that I'm not advertising it as essential vitamin and minerals
[26:24.520 --> 26:28.680]  for you and it's good for your immune system, which you need across the board.
[26:28.680 --> 26:32.080]  I was talking to medical doctor this morning, he was like, you're absolutely right, Alex.
[26:32.080 --> 26:34.480]  My family and us, we just take all the vitamins and minerals we're fine.
[26:34.480 --> 26:37.720]  No one in this office has gotten sick and the whole thing's basically a hoax.
[26:37.720 --> 26:39.520]  So people know the truth there.
[26:39.520 --> 26:44.440]  It's back in stock 1995 info or store.com and alpha power is back in stock sold out for
[26:44.440 --> 26:48.560]  a year with the COVID shutdowns, we couldn't get more to some of the key patented ingredients.
[26:48.560 --> 26:55.240]  Well, we've got it again, but not for long info or store.com throughout history, there
[26:55.240 --> 26:59.680]  have been two basic forms of civilizations and different mixes of the two.
[26:59.680 --> 27:02.720]  One is born of Renaissance, the other is born of conquest.
[27:02.720 --> 27:08.360]  One bases its power on having a strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture
[27:08.360 --> 27:11.760]  and ingenuity, art and skill and strength.
[27:11.760 --> 27:17.000]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above
[27:17.000 --> 27:18.000]  it.
[27:18.000 --> 27:23.280]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one
[27:23.280 --> 27:26.280]  of total mass, high tech slavery.
[27:26.280 --> 27:29.840]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded up slavery when it wasn't.
[27:29.840 --> 27:33.600]  They point out one of our evils so they can invert the fact that they are truly the slave
[27:33.600 --> 27:34.600]  masters.
[27:34.600 --> 27:38.760]  A global permanent lockdown is here, there's already causing millions and millions of star
[27:38.760 --> 27:42.040]  of death, when they're done, billions will starve to death.
[27:42.040 --> 27:45.640]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a top general have come out
[27:45.640 --> 27:49.920]  and said the COVID lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[27:49.920 --> 27:50.920]  That's the facts.
[27:50.920 --> 27:54.840]  This is the Bill Gates new world order weapon.
[27:54.840 --> 27:59.840]  Imagine a dystopic novel or a dystopic science fiction movie where if you've had a cold,
[27:59.840 --> 28:04.760]  you can be locked up in your home, you can be taken away, you can be forcibly inoculated
[28:04.760 --> 28:09.720]  with drugs that masquerade as vaccines that actually change your very DNA.
[28:09.720 --> 28:11.840]  That's where we are in the year 2020.
[28:11.840 --> 28:15.040]  Global government of the United Nations, all these authoritarian groups admit they're
[28:15.040 --> 28:16.040]  doing it.
[28:16.040 --> 28:21.480]  They even admit that they're doing it for power and control and that they're not even
[28:21.480 --> 28:23.200]  worried about COVID-19.
[28:23.200 --> 28:25.600]  That's what Klaus Schwab and others have said.
[28:25.600 --> 28:29.800]  Think about how it's say that as big tech's got to track you, they've got to trace you,
[28:29.800 --> 28:30.800]  they've got to control you.
[28:30.800 --> 28:32.640]  You've got to have absolutely your house.
[28:32.640 --> 28:37.840]  You've got to have secret police come disappear you because, my God, this thing has one-tenth
[28:37.840 --> 28:43.240]  of one percent chance of killing you, give you your ability to have cancer or heart attack.
[28:43.240 --> 28:45.160]  This is their takeover.
[28:45.160 --> 28:49.240]  Imagine on America's dystopic it killed by the fear of the common cold.
[28:49.240 --> 28:53.200]  Yeah, that's fear monitoring, that's mind control.
[28:53.200 --> 28:56.440]  You know, something very sad has happened to me and it's very sad because it was all
[28:56.440 --> 28:57.440]  avoidable.
[28:57.440 --> 29:01.760]  Two and a half years ago an info wars got banned off of more than 60 major platforms.
[29:01.760 --> 29:06.200]  I warned everybody that was a precedent for the upcoming presidential election and that
[29:06.200 --> 29:12.000]  they would continue to ratchet down and tighten down the censorship until effectively there
[29:12.000 --> 29:17.240]  was a total internet kill switch in place against conservatives, nationalists and populists
[29:17.240 --> 29:18.680]  and now that's happened.
[29:18.680 --> 29:22.640]  And then I told everybody that they would then start moving to arrest individuals that
[29:22.640 --> 29:28.320]  demonstrate in protest using a second COVID-19 lockdown and that Trump needed to get out
[29:28.320 --> 29:32.240]  front and fully repudiate COVID-19 is basically an overblown hoax.
[29:32.240 --> 29:37.000]  He started to do that in the last few months of the campaign but we have to understand
[29:37.000 --> 29:39.760]  that that's the pincer attack they're going to use.
[29:39.760 --> 29:43.360]  They're going to use Black Lives Matter and race war to stir up the American people and
[29:43.360 --> 29:46.960]  divide us and they're going to use economic warfare shredding down the economy to try
[29:46.960 --> 29:48.360]  to control us.
[29:48.360 --> 29:52.400]  I hope people will listen now to my warnings because I'm on air telling people what's coming
[29:52.400 --> 29:57.160]  next.
[29:57.160 --> 30:06.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:06.600 --> 30:27.400]  We're being gas-lipped by the psychological war chiefs.
[30:27.400 --> 30:30.480]  It came out four and a half years ago in the WikiLeaks.
[30:30.480 --> 30:32.480]  The plan.
[30:32.480 --> 30:37.440]  The top psychology professor talking to Hillary says we're losing control of the people.
[30:37.440 --> 30:45.120]  We need to accelerate culture war and that's what we're witnessing right now.
[30:45.120 --> 30:49.000]  Divide and conquer and then when they don't have the people believing anymore they just
[30:49.000 --> 30:53.240]  start putting out this info everywhere to where everything is so poisoned and so confused
[30:53.240 --> 30:57.840]  don't get to figure out what's going on and in the midst of it you demoralize people
[30:57.840 --> 31:03.880]  with an aged, doddering, crazy criminal that the system owns to rub it in our face and
[31:03.880 --> 31:08.560]  make us feel pathetic and to make us feel weak that this horribly weak, evil, twisted
[31:08.560 --> 31:12.080]  chai-con agent is up there and then he makes constant statements about yeah we stole the
[31:12.080 --> 31:17.120]  election, yeah I don't need your votes to win, yeah we put together the biggest voting fraud
[31:17.120 --> 31:22.720]  organization in the history, yeah they'll probably get rid of me and put Kamala in.
[31:22.720 --> 31:23.720]  She's the president, remember?
[31:23.720 --> 31:27.760]  People are like it's a slip, they keep saying the Harris-Biden administration.
[31:27.760 --> 31:33.480]  You went no, she'll be the president too, see it's all about getting rid of convention
[31:33.480 --> 31:37.480]  that's been put in place by our elders that was to protect us.
[31:37.480 --> 31:41.200]  We're like oh let's do it different, let's get rid of due process, let's do more, I'm
[31:41.200 --> 31:48.680]  going to present to you with Tom Papert in the next 30, 40 minutes or so just a snapshot
[31:48.680 --> 31:54.040]  of total election fraud from pillar to post with the people doing it on video, hiding
[31:54.040 --> 31:58.560]  it illegally, carrying it out, the media trying to cover it up and what's unfolding
[31:58.560 --> 32:03.200]  and the fact that it's the same strategy, the same stratagem, the same blueprint in
[32:03.200 --> 32:06.360]  all of these key five states that they've tried to steal.
[32:06.360 --> 32:10.680]  But just because somebody breaks in your house and steals your stuff and has got your grandma's
[32:10.680 --> 32:14.800]  silver and they're walking out with a pee pot, you can go oh my god I'm going to just
[32:14.800 --> 32:20.960]  sit here scared in my bedroom or you can go out there and take your silverware back and
[32:20.960 --> 32:24.440]  make it down the road to the pawn shop, you show up there and say that's my grandma's
[32:24.440 --> 32:29.760]  stuff, you call the police, you don't go oh let's see the media's in on it, like the
[32:29.760 --> 32:35.120]  pawn shop's in on it, oh no, oh this is our silver, well they're now complicit in the
[32:35.120 --> 32:36.120]  crime.
[32:36.120 --> 32:41.520]  They've gone for broke, we've got to go for broke but I feel the worm turning, we can
[32:41.520 --> 32:45.960]  defeat this one way or another, we're not going to back down, here is, since I mentioned
[32:45.960 --> 32:49.800]  it because it's too insane to just say it and not play the clip, where he talks about
[32:49.800 --> 32:52.680]  stepping down if he doesn't do it, Kamala says here it is.
[32:52.680 --> 32:56.160]  All kidding aside, the first lady to be told me she holds them for you.
[32:56.160 --> 33:02.360]  Yes she does, but not because she and Kamala have become friends, but all kidding aside
[33:02.360 --> 33:09.520]  it's a matter of the thing, we are simpatico on our philosophy of government and simpatico
[33:09.520 --> 33:15.080]  on how we want to approach these issues that we're facing and so I don't have and when
[33:15.080 --> 33:19.360]  we disagree it'll be just like so far, it's been just like when Barack and I did, it's
[33:19.360 --> 33:24.160]  in private, she'll say I think we should do A, B, C or D and I'll say I like A, I don't
[33:24.160 --> 33:30.920]  like B and C and let's go OK, and like I told Barack, if I reach something where there's
[33:30.920 --> 33:39.080]  a fundamental disagreement we have based on a moral principle, I'll develop some disease
[33:39.080 --> 33:41.800]  and say I have to resign.
[33:41.800 --> 33:48.280]  We don't have that, and we discussed at length our views on foreign policy, on domestic
[33:48.280 --> 33:51.680]  policy, on intelligence and the great thing is she has a background.
[33:51.680 --> 33:58.200]  Look at these two disingenuous, slimy frauds that know they've stolen this and just hope
[33:58.200 --> 34:00.120]  that we just gaslight until the end of time.
[34:00.120 --> 34:03.880]  All right, Tom Papert, there is so much huge breaking in this, I'm going to try to give
[34:03.880 --> 34:06.960]  you the floor to walk through this, I want to play a lot of these clips, we should first
[34:06.960 --> 34:15.480]  set the table, here's just some of the headlines, Georgia Governor calls on Georgia SOS to conduct
[34:15.480 --> 34:21.640]  signature audit ballots, which will sink the whole system, they've already done spot checks,
[34:21.640 --> 34:26.440]  they will get the 13,000 votes back very quickly, Trump will win and reverse the state, one
[34:26.440 --> 34:29.840]  state goes, it's the domino effect because they ran the same scam everywhere.
[34:29.840 --> 34:34.680]  Georgia Secretary of State now admits, national file, ballots were counted unlawfully and
[34:34.680 --> 34:37.640]  in secret because they have all the video in the witnesses.
[34:37.640 --> 34:43.640]  Red handed, Gateway Pundit identifies Georgia's overnight suitcase vote counter as Ruby Freeman
[34:43.640 --> 34:50.280]  and her daughter is the one that brings in the special suitcases, special boxes, hides
[34:50.280 --> 34:53.560]  them under the table till they kick everyone out and then they call them out and start
[34:53.560 --> 34:54.560]  going to town.
[34:54.560 --> 35:01.680]  It's a family affair, vote counter who provided suitcase ballots and his daughter a vote counter
[35:01.680 --> 35:08.320]  identified as Ruby Freeman, isn't that just special, isn't that just sweet and everybody's
[35:08.320 --> 35:12.400]  wearing the mask because Democrats had so like the little bandits and then it just goes
[35:12.400 --> 35:13.640]  on from there.
[35:13.640 --> 35:17.840]  Investigation of 100 ballot samples in Arizona finds 3% of the ballots were deemed fraudulent
[35:17.840 --> 35:23.600]  in favor of Joe Biden, but not for Trump, oh it was all Trump thrown out and if he got
[35:23.600 --> 35:26.040]  even one half and one percent back, he wins the state.
[35:26.040 --> 35:29.960]  See how that works.
[35:29.960 --> 35:33.560]  University document published in September of 2019 describes how the Democrats would
[35:33.560 --> 35:37.400]  steal the election, might want to read it.
[35:37.400 --> 35:45.640]  Mobile Brooks announces plans to challenge electoral college in Congress, it's on baby.
[35:45.640 --> 35:50.440]  Colonel Phil Waldron tells Michigan lawmakers truckloads of ballots for Joe Biden were inserted
[35:50.440 --> 35:56.080]  in 2020 election and they got approved and it goes on and on.
[35:56.080 --> 36:01.600]  I knew what was at stake from what I witnessed at the TCF, my heart broke Michigan GOP elections
[36:01.600 --> 36:09.160]  witness an immigrant shot by corruption and fraud where the ballots were marked in order,
[36:09.160 --> 36:14.240]  that yeah mail back in order and of course all for Joe Biden.
[36:14.240 --> 36:19.560]  This is ridiculous just like in Georgia they said they found tens of thousands of ballots
[36:19.560 --> 36:23.280]  that had never been folded and were perfectly printed by a computer on the Scantron not
[36:23.280 --> 36:30.680]  bubbled in with a pen or a pencil, perfectly printed in boxes stacked up, didn't even fold
[36:30.680 --> 36:31.680]  them to counterfeit them.
[36:31.680 --> 36:35.200]  Usually counterfeiters put the money in a washing machine or a dryer with a bunch of
[36:35.200 --> 36:40.640]  chips or whatever, scratch them up, bend them up, imagine a ten year old kid walks in with
[36:40.640 --> 36:45.920]  $1,000 bills in a cardio ship and says yeah I got these $1,000 bills, I'm going to buy
[36:45.920 --> 36:50.480]  that Ferrari right there for $200,000 and they go sonny let me check that money and
[36:50.480 --> 36:54.400]  even if it's real they go where'd you get all this money son?
[36:54.400 --> 36:58.840]  But oh here's all here big boxes all perfectly crisp, all printed by a computer, open and
[36:58.840 --> 37:03.040]  shut baby but the Justice Department says no evidence because they're part of the deep
[37:03.040 --> 37:04.040]  state takeover.
[37:04.040 --> 37:07.600]  Tom Patrick you'll be with us about 15 minutes the next day our nationalfoul.com you've been
[37:07.600 --> 37:11.600]  kicking ass I mean haven't slept tonight, we appreciate you being here, give us your
[37:11.600 --> 37:15.600]  overview of what we're looking at and where this is going and then we'll get into all
[37:15.600 --> 37:21.160]  the evidence next segment but amazing and of course I only covered the surface here.
[37:21.160 --> 37:24.600]  That's right I mean there's so much going on no one human being can track it all Alex
[37:24.600 --> 37:28.640]  it's totally insane but what we're seeing right now I think is some movement the conservative
[37:28.640 --> 37:33.200]  media is finally pushing in the same direction thanks in no small part to your broadcast.
[37:33.200 --> 37:36.880]  We're seeing state legislature after state legislature in this country come together
[37:36.880 --> 37:41.640]  and say we need a special session, we need to get back here, we need to reclaim our ability
[37:41.640 --> 37:45.980]  to assign electoral college votes and in many cases they're going as far to say we need
[37:45.980 --> 37:47.760]  to assign them to Trump.
[37:47.760 --> 37:52.720]  We're seeing lawsuits new lawsuits a new one is being filed today in Nevada that has hundreds
[37:52.720 --> 37:57.720]  of thousands of pieces of evidence, 90,000 illegal votes potentially and of course in
[37:57.720 --> 38:02.440]  Georgia the headlines just keep coming out it's a family affair it's a family fraud like
[38:02.440 --> 38:08.960]  you said Alex these people are caught red-handed on video the likes of the Fox News contingent
[38:08.960 --> 38:14.960]  and the likes of CNN will no longer be able to say zero evidence of fraud after today.
[38:14.960 --> 38:21.240]  And it just goes on and on and it's the same systematic blueprint in all these states.
[38:21.240 --> 38:27.200]  That's exactly it I mean that is the smoking gun that proves this was a coordinated effort
[38:27.200 --> 38:30.960]  we are all using the same machines we're all using the same tactics where we throw the
[38:30.960 --> 38:36.320]  vote counters out it almost the same exact time income the suitcases at one in the morning
[38:36.320 --> 38:39.360]  and they start counting until everybody goes home.
[38:39.360 --> 38:44.080]  You have in Michigan a very similar dynamic these women in Georgia are very clear Black
[38:44.080 --> 38:48.080]  Lives Matter supporters in Michigan you had a similar dynamic they're wearing Black Lives
[38:48.080 --> 38:53.840]  Matter shirts themselves it's the same type of political thug that committed this fraud
[38:53.840 --> 38:57.360]  in each and every battleground state and Alex like you were saying at the beginning of the
[38:57.360 --> 39:01.200]  broadcast I believe in states that are not even considered battleground states we need
[39:01.200 --> 39:05.200]  to go back and look at Virginia when this is said and done we need to go back and look
[39:05.200 --> 39:10.840]  yes at California when this is said and done in Travis County deep blue they caught them
[39:10.840 --> 39:15.360]  red-handed on undercover video it's been on local TV but nowhere else the exact damn paradigm
[39:15.360 --> 39:21.320]  what you just said the other states Tom exactly so this is so widespread and I think we're
[39:21.320 --> 39:25.200]  actually if we can get through this if we can keep pushing and secure victory we are
[39:25.200 --> 39:30.240]  on the cusp of total victory because they've been exposed Alex no more can they keep this
[39:30.240 --> 39:35.160]  going American knows about Dominion voting systems American knows about the thug like
[39:35.160 --> 39:37.160]  tactics are you doing on election day.
[39:37.160 --> 39:40.320]  And that's China put 400 million into it in October through a Swiss bank account I mean
[39:40.320 --> 39:46.960]  and their leader Klaus Schwab looks like Dr. Evil I mean man folks I'm telling you they're
[39:46.960 --> 39:53.960]  not gonna get away with this I'm serious well they're right back with Tom Papert I know it's
[39:53.960 --> 39:54.960]  China's.
[39:54.960 --> 39:57.480]  Ladies and gentlemen I hope we can stop the great reset that means a globalist imposed
[39:57.480 --> 40:01.520]  worldwide depression to break us and bring us under their control that's their stated
[40:01.520 --> 40:06.080]  admitted plan Justin Trudeau's on record Klaus Schwab all the different Democrat mayors
[40:06.080 --> 40:10.760]  they admit it's clowered in heaven implode the economy to make us go into their control
[40:10.760 --> 40:14.920]  but if we expose they're the ones doing it they go to prison instead of getting total
[40:14.920 --> 40:19.400]  power and total control and there are major uprisings happening across the world you're
[40:19.400 --> 40:23.440]  in the US thousands of sheriffs are saying hell no the lockdowns people are finally starting

[43:05.720 --> 43:09.920]  people and the small business people move into the big cities and go under communist
[43:09.920 --> 43:14.440]  commune control and that's all this is the big mega banks want to break us of the same
[43:14.440 --> 43:18.200]  ones that put Mao Zedong into power and they're creating the process of getting rid of our

[47:37.000 --> 47:42.960]  got places I can lead it the testimonies the videos I've got them all where do you want
[47:42.960 --> 47:47.400]  to start which which piece of fraud smoking gun first what Georgia that's I mean that's
[47:47.400 --> 47:50.960]  pretty big with the governor and even the secretary and all of them going okay there
[47:50.960 --> 47:58.120]  is fraud I mean wow there is systematic illegal manipulation of votes on damn video my God
[47:58.120 --> 48:01.880]  I think that that is the most pressing stay right now Alex because I've been told I've
[48:01.880 --> 48:05.000]  talked to people who are on the ground I've talked to some of the people who are very
[48:05.000 --> 48:09.840]  very high up in the Georgia political infrastructure and they tell me that Kim they cannot understand
[48:09.840 --> 48:14.440]  why he is not yet called a special session of the Georgia legislature once that happens
[48:14.440 --> 48:18.920]  they can overturn this election they can go county by county vote by vote say this is
[48:18.920 --> 48:23.520]  totally fraudulent we cannot let it stand they can certify the electors for Trump now
[48:23.520 --> 48:28.420]  Kemp seems to be getting closer I think he is about to break when there is damning video
[48:28.420 --> 48:33.040]  evidence like this Alex it's very difficult not to break so I think it's very important
[48:33.040 --> 48:38.600]  that we keep all eyes and all power and all force on Georgia and politically make these
[48:38.600 --> 48:42.560]  people do their job we elected them Alex you were down there the people who went out to
[48:42.560 --> 48:47.920]  see you elected Brian Kemp not communist China the man needs to call a special session of
[48:47.920 --> 48:53.760]  the legislature we have video of a mother and daughter team committing massive widespread
[48:53.760 --> 48:58.960]  fraud potentially in the most populated county in Georgia they legally kick out the poll
[48:58.960 --> 49:03.880]  watchers that they kept 50 feet away say things are closed because of a water main is broken
[49:03.880 --> 49:08.560]  which didn't break and then they go under the tables and pull out the damn suitcases
[49:08.560 --> 49:13.760]  I mean give me a freaking break it's beyond belief and so this starts you know you see
[49:13.760 --> 49:18.240]  the four or five people in the video and everybody is wondering well who the heck are these people
[49:18.240 --> 49:23.400]  well now we know thanks to the very good reporting of the gateway pundit it's the mother a woman
[49:23.400 --> 49:29.840]  named Ruby Freeman and her daughter her daughter she says in a Facebook video is her supervisor
[49:29.840 --> 49:34.560]  while she works on the election she talks about people complaining because her supervisor
[49:34.560 --> 49:39.360]  is giving out instructions that don't make sense and seem to be against the law she says
[49:39.360 --> 49:44.400]  well that's just how it is that's my supervisor she makes it very clear that her daughter
[49:44.400 --> 49:49.680]  is calling the shots well Alex her daughter happens to have long blonde dreadlocks that
[49:49.680 --> 49:55.640]  in a grainy security camera look a lot like braids her daughter is the woman who at 822
[49:55.640 --> 50:00.440]  in the morning on election day brought in these suitcases put full of ballots and then
[50:00.440 --> 50:05.840]  once everybody was gone because of the leaky toilets on that night she is the one who started
[50:05.840 --> 50:10.240]  removing the suitcases from underneath the table and counting them and ordering the other
[50:10.240 --> 50:15.920]  people to count them this is the biggest bombshell we have we need to figure out how the FBI needs
[50:15.920 --> 50:21.480]  to haul them all in now but of course they're not because bill bar is compromised that's
[50:21.480 --> 50:26.160]  precisely right so bare minimum what can we do here with this information well I'm sorry
[50:26.160 --> 50:30.400]  to say it Bolton County voters I'm sorry to say it you're gonna be thrown out this cannot
[50:30.400 --> 50:34.760]  be adjudicated there is no fixing this and when that happens Alex when the legislature
[50:34.760 --> 50:39.080]  does that or when it's done through the courts that will fundamentally change the election
[50:39.080 --> 50:43.200]  president Trump will have won Georgia in a landslide that's just one of many ways this
[50:43.200 --> 50:48.320]  can be accomplished and by the way I mean I am ready to get because listen we knew there
[50:48.320 --> 50:51.400]  was fraud we knew about the menu we knew about the scams we knew about the numbers going
[50:51.400 --> 50:56.720]  up after the polls closed that night but if you don't have smoking guns like we now have
[50:56.720 --> 51:01.800]  in Michigan and Georgia and Pennsylvania similar videos everywhere then you can't show the
[51:01.800 --> 51:06.040]  public that everyone gets all the toilets leaking and then your first is a big main
[51:06.040 --> 51:10.840]  broke all the toilet and then they close the whole thing down and then start get the ballots
[51:10.840 --> 51:14.160]  and just cramming them in as fast as they can like they're running a race looking over their
[51:14.160 --> 51:18.600]  shoulders and the same videos are in Pennsylvania and the same videos are in Michigan covering
[51:18.600 --> 51:22.640]  it up with brown paper but then Republicans get the footage and then there's the same
[51:22.640 --> 51:27.600]  damn thing again this is ridiculous I mean imagine if a cop was driving down the street
[51:27.600 --> 51:32.160]  and he saw you and you see him you you run into the woods the cops gonna come see what's
[51:32.160 --> 51:37.720]  going on because that's suspicious this is this is hand in the cookie jar man this is
[51:37.720 --> 51:44.120]  ridiculous it's the most obscene and absurd instance of fraud we've seen yet in your right
[51:44.120 --> 51:47.400]  Alex it's happening in every single state we're getting the affidavits we're getting
[51:47.400 --> 51:52.760]  the security camera video leaked and put out lawfully it is absolutely this is the strategy
[51:52.760 --> 51:58.440]  this is what they did kick the people out tell them that we're done send them home and then
[51:58.440 --> 52:03.120]  the hardened crew the Democrat operatives they pull out the suitcase votes and before
[52:03.120 --> 52:07.080]  you know it we were all there I mean I was up until like four in the morning after election
[52:07.080 --> 52:12.000]  night Alex I'm sure you were too when everybody went to sleep at around one Trump was winning
[52:12.000 --> 52:16.800]  then all of a sudden we know what happened now we know exactly why Georgia flipped it's
[52:16.800 --> 52:24.600]  because these women counted the same ballots probably over and over and over everybody
[52:24.600 --> 52:29.200]  slow and all but as soon as they close the doors they're running around like chickens
[52:29.200 --> 52:34.000]  with their heads cut off those like a beehive they're so busy that's exactly right I mean
[52:34.000 --> 52:37.800]  it's remarkable with the speed they move they knew they only had a few hours they knew that
[52:37.800 --> 52:41.600]  eventually the people would figure it out and get back there and the fact that they're
[52:41.600 --> 52:46.960]  pulling these votes out of black suitcases that again the supervisor the woman in charge
[52:46.960 --> 52:52.920]  as identified by her own mother is the one who brought these in the mother and daughter
[52:52.920 --> 52:58.400]  team on the cover of the newspaper exactly she posted this the mother posted this proudly
[52:58.400 --> 53:04.520]  to Facebook saying look at my daughter she's doing epic work as the election supervisor
[53:04.520 --> 53:09.440]  these people that's just it Alex they bragged about the fraud on Facebook you cannot make
[53:09.440 --> 53:14.920]  this stuff up that is so brazen and so disgusting and meanwhile if you or I post anything on
[53:14.920 --> 53:20.400]  Facebook we're going to be banned before it gets posted all right that's some of what
[53:20.400 --> 53:25.040]  we've got I want to play some of the testimony in Michigan and in Georgia when we come back
[53:25.040 --> 53:28.880]  and these are computer scientists these are engineers these are poll watchers but you
[53:28.880 --> 53:34.640]  don't need to be an engineer to know when the box of ballots come in unfolded and they're
[53:34.640 --> 53:40.760]  all in sequential order Tom what's that mean that means there's no way humanly possible
[53:40.760 --> 53:45.200]  for it to have happened unless it was fraud Alex yes folks and I know the listeners know
[53:45.200 --> 53:48.480]  this but when you're talking to a Democrat or somebody explain to them when you mail
[53:48.480 --> 53:53.240]  out hundreds of thousands of ballots in a state or millions they don't come back all
[53:53.240 --> 53:58.960]  nice and crisp with computer printouts of them and they're all in in sequential orders
[53:58.960 --> 54:04.440]  that's impossible that means that what's crazy Tom is the laziness of not even crinkling
[54:04.440 --> 54:08.960]  them or folding them or mixing in some Trump votes to oh I forgot they're almost always
[54:08.960 --> 54:14.720]  purely nothing but Biden votes as well Tom well that's exactly what it is you do have
[54:14.720 --> 54:18.880]  to wonder did they want us to see that are they rubbing our noses in it they made it
[54:18.880 --> 54:23.160]  so obvious these these ladies surely knew that they were on a security camera they're
[54:23.160 --> 54:27.000]  not even trying to hide it it's almost like it's part of our punishment Alex they're
[54:27.000 --> 54:32.360]  rubbing our nose in the mess we've made by electing president that's right every time
[54:32.360 --> 54:36.520]  they do this it's a felony every time we're out back with our to stay with us by the
[54:36.520 --> 54:46.160]  word folks only you could resist cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left
[54:46.160 --> 54:51.520]  it can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept if you have a family

[55:58.880 --> 56:05.240]  already over 130 billion dollars they've lost why would they take part in the hoax in the

[56:10.280 --> 56:14.360]  and it's solid a control and it's the same in every single industry and the big megabanks

[57:12.760 --> 57:17.840]  here and we were talking about how there's always more evidence we were focusing mainly
[57:17.840 --> 57:22.280]  on georgia they're pulling the video in right now but we have the secretary of state vote
[57:22.280 --> 57:30.680]  tallies that night on television and go ahead and kill that audio guys please thank you thank
[57:30.680 --> 57:41.600]  you appreciate that and so coming up i'm going to show you the video footage of as
[57:41.600 --> 57:47.600]  soon as they all come in and as soon as they kick everybody out that's when the vote total
[57:47.600 --> 57:52.080]  survive jump i mean we don't just have them looking around and pulling it out the kicker
[57:52.080 --> 57:55.320]  body out and saying it's a water main that broke and then scurrying and cramming them
[57:55.320 --> 57:59.960]  in then we have it all provide us let's come up next segment tom continue though let's
[57:59.960 --> 58:04.240]  segue into another state for the few minutes we'll come back to georgia next but what's
[58:04.240 --> 58:08.920]  the next big state what michigan that's what you know michigan is michigan is going to
[58:08.920 --> 58:13.000]  be one of the easier ones pennsylvania the legislature seems to be on our side but we
[58:13.000 --> 58:16.720]  have to get the governor tom wolf to play along i don't know if that's going to happen
[58:16.720 --> 58:21.320]  i think arizona alex is another state that not enough people are talking about that is
[58:21.320 --> 58:26.560]  an extremely easy victory for president trump the kelly ward announced the 100 balance sample
[58:26.560 --> 58:30.640]  that they got the other day they got it back they found two ballots one that was meant
[58:30.640 --> 58:35.200]  to be for trump and was instead assigned to biden one that was meant to be for trump and
[58:35.200 --> 58:39.120]  they just took the trump vote off they didn't even do anything else with it so if you extrapolate
[58:39.120 --> 58:44.720]  this alex it's very easy to see a path to victory if only 10.3 percent of the ballots
[58:44.720 --> 58:48.440]  required them to duplicate them and remember this is arizona where sharpie gate happened
[58:48.440 --> 58:51.920]  they handed them an instrument to fill out the ballot that ruined the ballot so it would
[58:51.920 --> 58:56.520]  have to be adjudicated by dominion employees that's what this was all about so it's very
[58:56.520 --> 59:00.760]  reasonable to assume that in arizona the adjudication rate the number of ballots that had to be fixed
[59:00.760 --> 59:06.200]  in other words is pretty darn high if it's up to 10.3 percent trump already wins the
[59:06.200 --> 59:12.920]  state no other fraud no other things exposed by a whopping 40 votes for zero votes so arizona
[59:12.920 --> 59:18.720]  is an extremely easy victory and we also see the the legislature there moving quickly
[59:18.720 --> 59:23.240]  against ducy and quickly to try to get a special session so they could assign the electoral
[59:23.240 --> 59:26.800]  votes to trump or withhold them entirely it's a big state and i think that we're gonna see
[59:26.800 --> 59:30.600]  progress in it so really what i should have set up for when you came on the big news is
[59:30.600 --> 59:34.800]  not just all the smoking on evidence now but also the legislatures are starting to move
[59:34.800 --> 59:39.760]  in the right direction that's exactly right and these people alex these are the modern
[59:39.760 --> 59:44.240]  revolutionaries these are the new founding fathers these are people who you know alex
[59:44.240 --> 59:49.960]  the state legislators are basically nothing in the political landscape of america in 2020
[59:49.960 --> 59:54.240]  but now we're returning back to the 19th century where the state legislature is one of the
[59:54.240 --> 59:58.880]  most important bodies not just in the state but in the country because it's the state
[59:58.880 --> 1:00:05.560]  legislators it's Doug Mastriano in pennsylvania it's representative fincham in arizona these
[1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:10.640]  are the people who can single handedly fix this election and keep the corrupt communist
[1:00:10.640 --> 1:00:15.720]  puppet and his his handler i guess kamala harris from ever even getting a chance to
[1:00:15.720 --> 1:00:22.600]  come close to the oval office wow we've got to recap that next segment of some stations
[1:00:22.600 --> 1:00:27.320]  don't carry this segment tom but you're absolutely right the legislatures are there as a check
[1:00:27.320 --> 1:00:32.680]  and balance on a stolen election on the federal government out of control and that's why they're
[1:00:32.680 --> 1:00:37.640]  now starting to kick in so arizona going the right direction michigan going the right direction
[1:00:37.640 --> 1:00:42.280]  the legislature the majority of republicans want a recount they want signatures checked
[1:00:42.280 --> 1:00:46.200]  the governor says yeah let's do it but there's not the authority unless he gives it to the
[1:00:46.200 --> 1:00:50.280]  legislature by calling the special session so he's trying to talk out both sides of his mouth
[1:00:51.400 --> 1:00:55.160]  that's exactly right and that's what's happening especially in georgia but in a lot of these
[1:00:55.160 --> 1:00:59.880]  states now one exciting thing alex michigan their legislature is in session until december
[1:00:59.880 --> 1:01:05.480]  31st of this year they have until the end of the year to fix this mess in the state of michigan
[1:01:05.480 --> 1:01:12.280]  without whitmer's permission she can't stop them you know i go off my intellectual research and
[1:01:12.280 --> 1:01:17.000]  then i go with my gut and my gut tells me this is winnable they have stolen it and here's the
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:20.520]  deal if you've stolen something from me just because you have possession doesn't mean i don't
[1:01:20.520 --> 1:01:26.440]  get to take it back we have to literally put the fear of god uh politically into these republicans
[1:01:26.440 --> 1:01:30.200]  and into fox news and the rest of them to understand you bet off more than you can chew again you
[1:01:30.200 --> 1:01:34.360]  told us trump will be impeached as a russian agent it didn't happen you're a bunch of lions scum
[1:01:34.920 --> 1:01:38.600]  so let's play a few of these legislative clips get into those numbers in georgia
[1:01:38.600 --> 1:01:43.560]  and more on the other side tom pappard of national file dot com with us i'm alex jones
[1:01:43.560 --> 1:01:48.280]  at info awards dot com and band on video george soros hopes you don't share that you are up
[1:01:48.280 --> 1:01:58.680]  back in 1996 the head of the world food program said that they would use food and global lockdowns
[1:01:58.680 --> 1:02:04.680]  due to a virus care to bring in world government that also came out the north american union
[1:02:04.680 --> 1:02:10.840]  documents the judicial watch and lou dobbs got more than 15 years ago as well so we know their plan
[1:02:10.840 --> 1:02:14.840]  and if they're able to keep this lockdown going it's going to cause not just a worldwide depression
[1:02:14.840 --> 1:02:19.640]  but mass starvation of hundreds of millions millions have already starved to death not from
[1:02:19.640 --> 1:02:24.440]  covid but from the lockdown that's why it's important for people in north america to get
[1:02:24.440 --> 1:02:28.520]  prepared hell all over the world but we have high-quality horrible food ready to ship to you
[1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:35.320]  the last 25 years and prepare with alex dot com there's an additional 10 off a very rare sale
[1:02:35.320 --> 1:02:41.000]  is going right now prepare with alex dot com also at info awards dot com we have all the great

[1:02:45.240 --> 1:02:50.520]  percent also take advantage of that at info or store dot com and prepare with alex dot com god bless
[1:02:50.520 --> 1:03:08.360]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[1:03:12.680 --> 1:03:17.960]  well we're into hour number two tom papper of national file is running shot done with us and
[1:03:17.960 --> 1:03:26.360]  i want you to recap what you were just saying the big news is that the legislatures have seen the
[1:03:26.360 --> 1:03:30.840]  fraud they've seen the testimony they're calling for special sessions and then we have smoking on
[1:03:30.840 --> 1:03:36.920]  video all over the country but georgia particularly of the whole chain of custody of the obvious fraud
[1:03:36.920 --> 1:03:41.320]  going on and we have the graph will put on screen from the secretary of state's office who now has
[1:03:41.320 --> 1:03:45.720]  to admit there was illegal voting going on and election fraud and illegal procedures that that's
[1:03:45.720 --> 1:03:50.680]  not getting any coverage and and then as soon as they close with the water main break they didn't
[1:03:50.680 --> 1:03:55.560]  stop counting that's the proof of fraud they accelerated the counting with select individuals
[1:03:55.560 --> 1:04:01.880]  recap that tom papper so alex what this basically comes down to is we the campaign and the journalist
[1:04:01.880 --> 1:04:06.520]  and the american people the viewers of info wars we have presented our evidence to the state
[1:04:06.520 --> 1:04:10.680]  legislators throughout this country in these battleground states georgia of course is the most
[1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:15.000]  damning where we have video evidence of this mother and daughter team ushering out the vote
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:19.400]  observers and then counting a suitcase balance that they brought in at eight in the morning in
[1:04:19.400 --> 1:04:24.440]  the middle of the night absolutely reprehensible so where we're at now is we have a lot of these
[1:04:24.440 --> 1:04:29.560]  state legislatures that at least have coalitions if not outright republican majorities that are
[1:04:29.560 --> 1:04:35.080]  ready to overturn the elections in their states they've examined the fraud they want to examine it
[1:04:35.080 --> 1:04:39.400]  further and when it's all said and done they're going to say there is no way we can certify this
[1:04:39.400 --> 1:04:44.200]  for the communist puppet joe biden he is not going to be president we're either going to
[1:04:44.200 --> 1:04:49.000]  withhold our electoral college votes or we're going to assign them to president donald trump now
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:53.960]  there are a few states where there are barriers brian kimp the governor down there in georgia
[1:04:53.960 --> 1:05:00.440]  he has thus far refused all urges to call a special session of the georgia legislature which
[1:05:00.440 --> 1:05:05.560]  leaves us only in the courts but i believe he's close yesterday we saw him buckle again when he
[1:05:05.560 --> 1:05:10.760]  appeared on fox news and throughout the day after this bombshell video came out so the evidence
[1:05:10.760 --> 1:05:16.200]  is too hard to ignore but alex these people the dugmas trianos in pennsylvania the representative
[1:05:16.200 --> 1:05:22.040]  finchams who's calling for this in arizona these people are the modern founding fathers while our
[1:05:22.040 --> 1:05:27.240]  federal congress is going to sit on its hands potentially and do nothing while the doj is
[1:05:27.240 --> 1:05:33.240]  going to do nothing the fbi is corrupt these people at the state level at the local level people
[1:05:33.240 --> 1:05:38.120]  who never get news coverage people who don't make a lot of money in much of the country these are
[1:05:38.120 --> 1:05:43.160]  the ones who can save our constitutional republic these are the ones who can prevent a chi com
[1:05:43.160 --> 1:05:48.280]  globalist takeover if they do this they will be the modern founding fathers if they do not they're
[1:05:48.280 --> 1:05:53.480]  going to be a bunch of benedict arnold's and we will remember them as that well that's why either
[1:05:53.480 --> 1:05:58.680]  way we win and i don't just like to put a statement like that out there to sound like we're confident
[1:05:58.680 --> 1:06:03.800]  i've been really upset i've been losing sleep i've cracked three of my teeth in the last couple
[1:06:03.800 --> 1:06:09.480]  months with the selection what's happened since the dentist again today uh i've worked a mouse
[1:06:09.480 --> 1:06:12.760]  plant now i've never had to do because i'm so stressed out i can't help it this is i'm being
[1:06:12.760 --> 1:06:17.240]  robbed i'm being insulted my family as you are we're all in this together but i can see the
[1:06:17.240 --> 1:06:21.960]  evidence i can see people waking up and i can just see that no one's buying this and the corporate
[1:06:21.960 --> 1:06:27.240]  media is only destroying themselves that much worse i mean there is a seismic shift now where
[1:06:28.280 --> 1:06:32.200]  because i guess i'm well known and again bragging the listeners it's a bellwether
[1:06:32.200 --> 1:06:35.800]  so they don't need to feel like they're alone when i go out even in liberal austin now
[1:06:36.600 --> 1:06:42.760]  to a dentist or to the grocery store or walk down the street or a restaurant it's old people young
[1:06:42.760 --> 1:06:47.320]  people men women black white every and they're like we get it it's true did you know this i mean
[1:06:47.320 --> 1:06:52.760]  there's a huge awakening this just super charged it so they say god works in mysterious ways
[1:06:53.880 --> 1:06:59.960]  this trying to put the crypt keeper in kamala harris that could even get half a percent of
[1:06:59.960 --> 1:07:05.560]  democrats to support her out of the out of the democrat candidates and then she's even lower
[1:07:05.560 --> 1:07:11.560]  with black black americans hate her for whatever reason i hate her too she's very fake and i guess
[1:07:11.560 --> 1:07:17.160]  they pick up on that but i mean these people are crazy i mean if they were slick like donald trump
[1:07:17.160 --> 1:07:22.680]  but evil they might have a chance but they don't have any chance with the mainstream media propping
[1:07:22.680 --> 1:07:27.080]  them up having the mainstream media endorse you is not a good thing having the mainstream media
[1:07:27.080 --> 1:07:32.680]  tell you the vaccine is safe has two-thirds of americans saying they won't take it it's just crazy
[1:07:34.280 --> 1:07:38.760]  well that's exactly right alex no this is like i said earlier on the show here this is the cusp
[1:07:38.760 --> 1:07:42.760]  of not just a victory that we get to get to keep the white house for another four years no alex
[1:07:42.760 --> 1:07:48.120]  we're on the cusp of total victory if we prove this fraud and we are if we convince the state
[1:07:48.120 --> 1:07:53.480]  legislatures and the courts to do the right thing and it is very clear what the right thing is here
[1:07:53.480 --> 1:07:57.480]  this may never happen again the democrats right this is their water live this is their
[1:07:58.040 --> 1:08:01.080]  say that again because i'm interrupting but i mean you're right i just want to highlight what you're
[1:08:01.080 --> 1:08:07.320]  saying if we fight now and say no and take it back from them it destroys them it's their water
[1:08:07.320 --> 1:08:12.760]  live explain that so this is it i mean they have pulled out every trick in the books the traditional
[1:08:12.760 --> 1:08:16.840]  fraud is what we saw on video with the mother daughter team and their stuffing ballots we're
[1:08:16.840 --> 1:08:20.440]  learning about dominion we're learning that china is dumping millions of dollars into this we're
[1:08:20.440 --> 1:08:26.440]  learning that the the communists in venezuela designed 28 states voting system the american
[1:08:26.440 --> 1:08:31.000]  people as you're talking about are awake like never before they're not going to go back to sleep
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:36.440]  the only way they can crush us is if they installed their puppet biden and then spend the next four
[1:08:36.440 --> 1:08:41.400]  years calling us crazy and threatening to put us in camps that is the only way they can stop this
[1:08:41.400 --> 1:08:45.800]  if we have victory we will have total victory meaning they're not going to be able to do this
[1:08:45.800 --> 1:08:50.840]  again california may be a swing state again if we can disprove all of this fraud and make it so they
[1:08:50.840 --> 1:08:55.720]  can never do it again that's why when president trump one of his key points in that speech he made
[1:08:55.720 --> 1:09:01.720]  the other day which i agree was amazing was that electoral so uh integrity election integrity
[1:09:01.720 --> 1:09:06.120]  may be the biggest achievement of his campaign and he's absolutely right because this is a
[1:09:06.120 --> 1:09:12.280]  fundamentally different america 2016 would not have been half as difficult to win if we did not
[1:09:12.280 --> 1:09:18.200]  have this fraud that has only been accelerated and magnified by the coveted 19 scam dimmick
[1:09:18.200 --> 1:09:23.240]  and they're they're insane push for mail-in ballots well that's it and the democrat deep
[1:09:23.240 --> 1:09:29.880]  state chi-con backed boa constrictor is trying to feed us into its mouth and trying to eat us but
[1:09:29.880 --> 1:09:34.120]  we're an elephant they might be able to eat you know a small horse or something but he can't
[1:09:34.120 --> 1:09:39.080]  eat an elephant and so we just have to kick and scream and not let it eat us yeah it's got one
[1:09:39.080 --> 1:09:44.280]  of our legs in its mouth but we just stomp on its head it's going to crawl away doesn't matter
[1:09:44.280 --> 1:09:48.520]  of the whole media says he's the president elect he's the president he's the president they said
[1:09:48.520 --> 1:09:52.600]  they weren't going to accept the results until the electoral college and they said that still
[1:09:52.600 --> 1:09:57.320]  wouldn't be they were going to inaugurate him as another president and have a secession the new
[1:09:57.320 --> 1:10:02.280]  york times said john pedestrian was wargaming but now oh and we have all the evidence we're supposed
[1:10:02.280 --> 1:10:07.080]  to go away it's preposterous it's crazy and i am seeing cracks at fox news that you betrayed
[1:10:07.080 --> 1:10:12.040]  trump at the key moment we knew they would they've lost half their audience at least they get nobody's
[1:10:12.040 --> 1:10:17.160]  buying their bs anymore uh and then as as this evidence mounts because you hear cnn here's fox
[1:10:17.160 --> 1:10:23.880]  news no evidence of venice waylord china connected to dominion it's ridiculous you know next they'll
[1:10:23.880 --> 1:10:29.560]  say the ocean has water in it and then meanwhile all the sec documents all the admissions pbs
[1:10:29.560 --> 1:10:35.320]  documentaries about it years ago i mean this is ridiculous how they go all preposterous oh there
[1:10:35.320 --> 1:10:41.240]  there's none of that going on there's no affidavits there's nothing happening it doesn't work and bar
[1:10:41.240 --> 1:10:46.920]  coming out was a reserve army we know he's been a deep state double agent at least but the fact
[1:10:46.920 --> 1:10:52.280]  that he came out against trump a few days ago showed their total desperation that was their
[1:10:52.280 --> 1:10:58.840]  emergency get out of jail free car tonight ain't working well that's exactly right i mean you're
[1:10:58.840 --> 1:11:02.680]  you described bar perfectly there i've never quite thought about it that way but that's correct i mean
[1:11:02.680 --> 1:11:07.640]  bar's father hired jeffrey eppstein to teach at a girl school when nobody else would that's who bar's
[1:11:07.640 --> 1:11:11.800]  family is so it makes perfect sense that he's been this sleeper with a significant amount of
[1:11:11.800 --> 1:11:17.240]  trump supporters saying oh he plays the bagpipes i love him now he comes out but there is nothing
[1:11:17.240 --> 1:11:22.120]  that can stop this the american people have finally figured it out alex that the entire
[1:11:22.120 --> 1:11:27.240]  combine the globalist machine has been lying to them since they first showed up in kindergarten
[1:11:27.240 --> 1:11:31.640]  and said the pledge of allegiance and sat down for their full day of communist indoctrination
[1:11:31.640 --> 1:11:36.680]  the american people realizes that we have donald trump a fighter in the arena who is not going to
[1:11:36.680 --> 1:11:43.000]  go down without swinging and that he is going to tear this thing apart with our health the american
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:46.600]  and listen i totally agree back in the bottle and sorry can't put the genie back in the bottle
[1:11:48.040 --> 1:11:53.160]  no you're that's exactly right alex you cannot put the american people back to sleep after this
[1:11:53.160 --> 1:11:58.360]  all this has a little caveat this is how this works joe biden's getting control of the justice
[1:11:58.360 --> 1:12:03.640]  department and jones uh they're planning to indict you if you don't back down and that's the phone
[1:12:03.640 --> 1:12:09.000]  calls i get uh from let's say high-level people they're telling them to tell me we're gonna indict
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:13.400]  you we'll go ahead and indict me you little chicken neck piece of trash you think i'm scared of you
[1:12:13.400 --> 1:12:17.480]  what's for some fraud you made if you think a miracle by that how about you indict 100 million
[1:12:17.480 --> 1:12:21.720]  americans we're sick of your crap and all you're doing is pushing us into a corner you little
[1:12:21.720 --> 1:12:26.760]  chicken neck rats the games are over papper let's play those clips i talked about one more segment

[1:14:46.600 --> 1:15:16.520]  so here's the governor i'm georgia saying he wants the signatures to be
[1:15:17.320 --> 1:15:20.920]  independently evaluated because it turns out most of the ones for biden didn't even have a
[1:15:20.920 --> 1:15:26.920]  signature on them here it is a big victory lefler you know i called early on for a signature audit
[1:15:26.920 --> 1:15:31.400]  obviously the secretary of state per the laws and the constitution would have to order that he has
[1:15:31.400 --> 1:15:37.000]  not done that i think it should be done i think especially with what we saw today it raises more
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:43.160]  questions there needs to be transparency on that i would again call for that and uh i think in the
[1:15:43.160 --> 1:15:48.840]  next 24 hours hopefully we'll see a lot more from the hearings that the legislature had today and
[1:15:48.840 --> 1:15:54.760]  we'll be able to look and see what the next steps are and now that very secretary of state says
[1:15:54.760 --> 1:16:00.440]  there is evidence of criminal violation of election law pulling out the ballots pulling out the suit
[1:16:00.440 --> 1:16:06.200]  cases while they said it was closed i mean what are they doing they said it's closed it's not
[1:16:06.200 --> 1:16:14.280]  then it spikes for biden this is the most open and shut case i've ever seen mr pappard i agree
[1:16:14.280 --> 1:16:18.280]  completely alex it is open and shut again it almost feels like they wanted us to catch this it
[1:16:18.280 --> 1:16:22.520]  almost feels like they wanted to rub our nose and how they could get away with this fraud but
[1:16:22.520 --> 1:16:26.520]  they're not going to get away with this fraud because yes governor kim has finally come around
[1:16:26.520 --> 1:16:32.840]  on signature verification calling on georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger to finally
[1:16:32.840 --> 1:16:37.080]  go through with this now i have no idea why raffensperger isn't doing this i've talked to people
[1:16:37.080 --> 1:16:41.080]  on the ground in georgia who say that prior to this election they thought he was a good guy
[1:16:41.080 --> 1:16:45.080]  they don't know if he's been paid they don't know what unearth has done this but the fact is kim
[1:16:45.080 --> 1:16:50.920]  also has to do a little bit more kim can totally invalidate the need for raffensperger to wake up
[1:16:50.920 --> 1:16:56.120]  and do his job if kim will call a special session of the georgia the governor can't hide behind the
[1:16:56.120 --> 1:17:02.920]  secretary you're not not doing his job he absolutely has to call out the damn legislature
[1:17:02.920 --> 1:17:08.120]  that's we should be doing this well and the legislature for what i've been told a lot of
[1:17:08.120 --> 1:17:12.600]  the republicans in the republican controlled georgia's legislature they want to do this
[1:17:12.600 --> 1:17:17.160]  it given the opportunity by brian kim they will take the proverbial bullets they will
[1:17:17.160 --> 1:17:21.560]  take the political you know what storm kim can sit there in his governor's mansion and watch
[1:17:21.560 --> 1:17:26.440]  netflix for the rest of his term before he's never elected again the legislature is willing
[1:17:26.440 --> 1:17:32.280]  to take the heat the fact is kim for whatever reason has not and will not yet call a special
[1:17:32.280 --> 1:17:37.560]  session of the georgia the bat and got kim elected out of nowhere let's go to the next clip here i
[1:17:37.560 --> 1:17:43.640]  haven't played this clip yet this is gateway pond it plays this clip it's uh himma claudin gritty
[1:17:44.200 --> 1:17:49.160]  and this is some of the stuff that she witnessed in michigan here it is writing down the ballot
[1:17:49.160 --> 1:17:54.280]  numbers and the last names of the person of the ballot uh that had the name on the ballot
[1:17:55.560 --> 1:18:02.120]  they were all in sequence these are absentee ballots mail in mail in ballots they cannot be
[1:18:02.120 --> 1:18:07.720]  in sequence two two three two cannot have two two three three next to it because if they're mailed in
[1:18:07.720 --> 1:18:13.960]  they come in all different numbers and when when i started noticing that these numbers are almost
[1:18:13.960 --> 1:18:18.120]  next to each other like one or the other was in the middle but then they were almost next to each
[1:18:18.120 --> 1:18:24.600]  other my my antennas went up that's exactly when i thought something is not right here then i asked
[1:18:24.600 --> 1:18:34.520]  the supervisor there was not even a date on those uh envelopes it said november zero dash 2020 there was
[1:18:34.520 --> 1:18:41.080]  no second number there then i said what is the date on this one then they got really mad at me they
[1:18:41.080 --> 1:18:45.480]  said you're not letting us do our job you're disturbing us and at that point because we really
[1:18:45.480 --> 1:18:49.240]  don't want to be kicked out you know so we were just kind of not challenging anything because we
[1:18:49.240 --> 1:18:54.840]  want to still stay in the room because we barely had anybody um not only that the sequence ballot
[1:18:54.840 --> 1:19:01.080]  numbers were all from the same area like the guarded street in the downtown detroit guarded street
[1:19:01.800 --> 1:19:08.520]  sequential ballots signatures were all alike they had no date stamp it said like it was empty after
[1:19:08.520 --> 1:19:14.360]  zero there was no third or second or first or nothing and uh they were none of them were coming
[1:19:14.360 --> 1:19:18.680]  up in the system they were all being entered manually they even knew that none of these details
[1:19:18.680 --> 1:19:24.200]  would even be in the poll book or in the system this is like somebody coming into your gas station
[1:19:24.200 --> 1:19:30.920]  and trying to buy a cup of coffee and a sandwich with monopoly money i mean you know it's fake on
[1:19:30.920 --> 1:19:37.480]  its face tom this is ridiculous it is alex and i have a potential uh idea of how this may have
[1:19:37.480 --> 1:19:42.680]  happened after examining georgia so i talked to an election expert last night who testified yesterday
[1:19:42.680 --> 1:19:47.640]  he said that what they found is they're using homeless shelters in downtown atlanta and other
[1:19:47.640 --> 1:19:53.080]  democrat strongholds to register thousands of people and institutions and nursing homes
[1:19:54.120 --> 1:19:58.040]  which by the way seems to be now the experts have not weighed in meaning the lawyers but
[1:19:58.040 --> 1:20:02.920]  that seems to be a clear and obvious violation of the law you cannot have 2 000 people like alex
[1:20:02.920 --> 1:20:06.520]  you can't just walk into a homeless shelter and say i'm here to register to vote i mean it's
[1:20:06.520 --> 1:20:10.360]  absolutely ridiculous so i guess people have been ordered to do this i mean we know that
[1:20:10.360 --> 1:20:14.600]  that and then of course when that happens whether or not these votes are even real
[1:20:14.600 --> 1:20:18.120]  they fill them all out they return then that is but look at what happened with uh
[1:20:19.480 --> 1:20:25.480]  you know the islamic from uh the the desert hellhole what's her name what's the name of
[1:20:25.480 --> 1:20:29.160]  the islamic globalist from minnesota will pop my head to men i'm having one of those a lot of
[1:20:29.160 --> 1:20:33.720]  air on omar remember veritas got that months before the election where they would go to all
[1:20:33.720 --> 1:20:38.360]  the apartment blocks of the immigrants and tell them we'll have you deported if you don't fill
[1:20:38.360 --> 1:20:41.400]  this out in your name like i'm not even a citizen but they still make them do it and they make
[1:20:41.400 --> 1:20:46.680]  citizens do it under threat that's how they do it that's exactly right then when it comes time to
[1:20:46.680 --> 1:20:51.480]  figure out okay who was this vote actually going to be assigned to that's how come the 85-year-old
[1:20:51.480 --> 1:20:55.880]  grandma has tried to go vote on november 3rd and we're told no you already voted by mail three
[1:20:55.880 --> 1:21:00.920]  weeks ago because an illegal immigrant or somebody else in that position possibly at ilano mars
[1:21:00.920 --> 1:21:05.880]  pay uh voted in their place this is one of the creditors of samalis they came out and
[1:21:05.880 --> 1:21:11.560]  bitched and said we don't like being threatened to make to do this as did the native americans alex
[1:21:11.560 --> 1:21:17.000]  we now have native americans who've come out and said we were paid in gas cards in yachts in vacations
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:22.120]  in everything you can imagine because they wanted to buy our votes it's the it's disgusting it's the
[1:21:22.120 --> 1:21:27.160]  honest to god racism of the democrat party it's almost a tired talking point but we've never
[1:21:27.160 --> 1:21:31.880]  seen it like this before they go to poor samalis they go to poor native americans and they hand
[1:21:31.880 --> 1:21:37.400]  them gas cards for votes it's demeaning and it's disgusting well it well that at least they did that
[1:21:37.400 --> 1:21:42.200]  in some areas ilan omar they threatened them and just said you're gonna do this that's right they
[1:21:42.200 --> 1:21:48.200]  said is there like racial or something muslim spiritual uh goal that they must vote for joe
[1:21:48.200 --> 1:21:52.600]  biden a man who will drone strike their family members overseas have given the opportunity
[1:21:53.720 --> 1:21:58.600]  i got so many other clips ours of them brother but i mean you've got the state legislature
[1:21:58.600 --> 1:22:05.880]  head guide mark fits him closing remarks in arizona saying this is racketeering he said it's
[1:22:05.880 --> 1:22:10.520]  exceedingly hard for me to place a label on what i've heard other than racketeering giant
[1:22:10.520 --> 1:22:18.200]  organized criminal practices that's exactly right alex i'm i'm honestly i'm very optimistic and
[1:22:18.200 --> 1:22:24.520]  i've gone back and forth like you but the fact is no i don't know this is so strong that i mean
[1:22:24.520 --> 1:22:30.440]  this is unbelievable and these legislators alex they have the ability i don't know if if any of
[1:22:30.440 --> 1:22:34.760]  them are watching right now i want you to understand that you can be the new patrick
[1:22:34.760 --> 1:22:40.360]  in a year you can be the new george washington but your career is going to slow whoever does
[1:22:40.360 --> 1:22:45.480]  the right thing here is in congress is in the senate is the is the next exactly this is the
[1:22:45.480 --> 1:22:50.760]  new 1776 that's what i see here is this is not a challenge this is an opportunity that the enemy
[1:22:50.760 --> 1:22:56.440]  has really showed themselves that's exactly right the democrat party if we finish this if we make it
[1:22:56.440 --> 1:23:01.000]  to the finish line and truly expose their corruption and evil once and for all they're not going to be
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:06.440]  able to continue exist in this form is a national party but i want to be clear even if they somehow
[1:23:06.440 --> 1:23:12.280]  smuggle the crypt keeper into power that destroys them too i mean as long as we just say we don't
[1:23:12.280 --> 1:23:16.360]  buy this we never give up we don't ever give into their gaslighting we don't ever give into
[1:23:16.360 --> 1:23:20.120]  their confidence game it destroys them because we have the truth they have the lies we never
[1:23:20.120 --> 1:23:24.600]  give in we never surrender we have the proof and i can't wait to hear what else comes out now
[1:23:24.600 --> 1:23:31.480]  that the meat of the potatoes i mean the the the epic level of the proof is just ridiculous and i
[1:23:31.480 --> 1:23:36.040]  know it'll all be at nationalfile.com tom pabbert we love you and we appreciate you thank you so
[1:23:36.040 --> 1:23:40.680]  much alex it's always a pleasure thank you for the opportunity now that's that's some of the good
[1:23:40.680 --> 1:23:45.640]  news i'm going to give you the really nasty news coming up the force inoculations the checkpoints
[1:23:45.640 --> 1:23:52.840]  the imploded economy warning warning warning there is not long to stop the complete
[1:23:52.840 --> 1:23:58.280]  martial law takeover the giant third world collapse and a new world war that is going to
[1:23:58.280 --> 1:24:04.600]  be triggered by the new covid lockdown announced by globalist systems in europe in asia and now
[1:24:04.600 --> 1:24:11.800]  in the united states joe bite is set to announce today that he has a new covid task force that
[1:24:11.800 --> 1:24:17.080]  is calling for a national mask mandate to prove your servitude contact tracing forced
[1:24:17.080 --> 1:24:23.800]  inoculations coming but most importantly a new lockdown that way he can say that trump is to
[1:24:23.800 --> 1:24:30.520]  blame for covid and claim that only a new lockdown will stop covid then of course when that new
[1:24:30.520 --> 1:24:35.240]  lockdown doesn't work those of us that didn't submit to the lockdown are going to be blamed for it
[1:24:35.240 --> 1:24:40.280]  and that's when all the mass arrests start sometime towards the end of next year this is a permanent
[1:24:40.280 --> 1:24:46.680]  martial law plan trump must be putiated expose faucian gates and the un takeover not play games

[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:55.960]  where have i heard of that before oh the great leap forward mouse a ton ordering all the small
[1:25:55.960 --> 1:26:01.320]  towns and small farms to basically shut down and have the rural people and the small business people
[1:26:01.320 --> 1:26:06.680]  move into the big cities and go under communist commune control and that's all this is the big
[1:26:06.680 --> 1:26:10.440]  mega banks want to break us to the same ones that put mousing time into power and they're
[1:26:10.440 --> 1:26:14.600]  creating the process of getting rid of our old economy bringing in the new economy where everything's
[1:26:14.600 --> 1:26:19.720]  free because when you're a prisoner well everything's free but you're also a slave
[1:26:19.720 --> 1:26:24.840]  scotland is going to have universal guaranteed incomes now of subsistence level but of course
[1:26:24.840 --> 1:26:29.400]  you got to take those vaccines you can't have any kids and oh and don't worry though all of the
[1:26:29.400 --> 1:26:35.800]  uh tampons and and stuff like that's free too as well i'm not kidding so give me some free paper
[1:26:35.800 --> 1:26:40.360]  they give me enough money to basically live in a tiny apartment but they own you they control you
[1:26:40.360 --> 1:26:45.080]  that's the great reset it's why it's got to be resisted to total takeover and we're fighting it
[1:26:45.080 --> 1:27:01.000]  and in full wars dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:27:15.080 --> 1:27:37.000]  oh
[1:27:45.080 --> 1:27:52.880]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, very, very honored to be here with you in defiance of tyranny.
[1:27:52.880 --> 1:27:57.880]  Very honored to be aligned with you and with God in our future destiny, wouldn't want to
[1:27:57.880 --> 1:27:58.880]  be anywhere else.
[1:27:58.880 --> 1:28:03.800]  Thank you for keeping us at the tip of the spear.
[1:28:03.800 --> 1:28:12.080]  I spent a lot of time in the first half of the broadcast today talking about the incredible
[1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:27.080]  evidence of fraud and just the bonafide pillar to post entire lifespan or chain of events,
[1:28:27.080 --> 1:28:33.160]  the compendium of a fraud and all the different angles and all the different point shaving
[1:28:33.160 --> 1:28:38.120]  and the ways they do it, destroying Trump ballots, having fake filled out ballots, closing
[1:28:38.120 --> 1:28:43.240]  polling places, then running through a bunch of votes all for Biden in five states all perfectly
[1:28:43.240 --> 1:28:46.800]  on the graph to the minute and then having the video of it.
[1:28:46.800 --> 1:28:55.400]  I mean, that's just insane and it shows you the arrogance of evil.
[1:28:55.400 --> 1:28:59.320]  I mean, as much as I hate the new world order and stuff, I wouldn't go take over an elections
[1:28:59.320 --> 1:29:04.720]  facility and engage in fraud and I sure as hell wouldn't do it on camera.
[1:29:04.720 --> 1:29:09.360]  They did it, but that's how sure they are in the establishment, the media.
[1:29:09.360 --> 1:29:12.160]  That's why they brag about being invincible.
[1:29:12.160 --> 1:29:18.040]  It's why they admit the crimes they commit on TV because they want to rub people's noses
[1:29:18.040 --> 1:29:24.840]  in it, but also get their minions be willing to do anything.
[1:29:24.840 --> 1:29:33.680]  Now, there's another really big story that I haven't gotten to and I really, really need
[1:29:33.680 --> 1:29:44.680]  to get to it and it deals with the next level that is now here of censorship and it deals
[1:29:44.680 --> 1:29:51.760]  with YouTube saying they're going to quote, suppress the videos of white males and not
[1:29:51.760 --> 1:29:53.160]  let them trend.
[1:29:53.160 --> 1:29:54.160]  Wow.
[1:29:54.160 --> 1:30:01.520]  They're going to discriminate because someone has white skin and is male that so now just
[1:30:01.520 --> 1:30:09.080]  because you're white, you're not going to be able to trend.
[1:30:09.080 --> 1:30:15.400]  By the way, I'm not joking, it actually says we will suppress white males.
[1:30:15.400 --> 1:30:16.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, what is that meant to do?
[1:30:16.840 --> 1:30:23.200]  It's meant to create total racial division and it is so illegal and it's so criminal
[1:30:23.200 --> 1:30:29.240]  and it's so racist and it's not black people or brown people doing it.
[1:30:29.240 --> 1:30:36.120]  It is the establishment saying we represent brown people and we protect you and so you
[1:30:36.120 --> 1:30:40.320]  need to be for big tech because we're going to take care of you.
[1:30:40.320 --> 1:30:46.120]  Yeah, just like YouTube started with, oh, we're going to give you a little bit of rev
[1:30:46.120 --> 1:30:50.880]  share to bring your product here and now they don't need you anymore.
[1:30:50.880 --> 1:30:57.120]  It's called domestication and the way they patronize brown people and treat you like
[1:30:57.120 --> 1:31:02.880]  you are a barnyard animal that can't be successful without them.
[1:31:02.880 --> 1:31:09.080]  When I look at the metrics actually, entertainment and in media, people with brown skin are doing
[1:31:09.080 --> 1:31:14.040]  far better than white people with the whole way the culture has been basically positioned.
[1:31:14.040 --> 1:31:20.640]  It's just unbelievable that if you're a white guy from Russia or say a white guy from Chile
[1:31:20.640 --> 1:31:23.720]  whose family history had nothing to do with slavery or anything, but you're going to
[1:31:23.720 --> 1:31:29.080]  be suppressed because of the color of your skin, it is absolutely incredible.
[1:31:29.080 --> 1:31:30.440]  So I had that in the stack.
[1:31:30.440 --> 1:31:32.840]  I can't find it right now, so reprint me that please.
[1:31:32.840 --> 1:31:33.840]  Thank you.
[1:31:33.840 --> 1:31:36.400]  But I'm going to be getting to that.
[1:31:36.400 --> 1:31:38.840]  Okay.
[1:31:38.840 --> 1:31:43.920]  Going on into the election fraud, we're going to have a lady who's a lawyer and who's run
[1:31:43.920 --> 1:31:49.440]  for office and only lost by a few votes at the state legislative level and she's very
[1:31:49.440 --> 1:31:50.440]  well-spoken.
[1:31:50.440 --> 1:31:54.840]  She's here with us at a little impromptu demonstration against Mayor Adler of Austin who flies around
[1:31:54.840 --> 1:31:59.240]  in private jets and goes to huge parties and doesn't wear a mask and doesn't show social
[1:31:59.240 --> 1:32:00.240]  distance.
[1:32:00.240 --> 1:32:05.360]  She caught the fraud on video, the same exact tactics you see all over the country on November
[1:32:05.360 --> 1:32:06.360]  3rd.
[1:32:06.360 --> 1:32:13.600]  She'll be in studio with us as well coming up about 15 after in the next hour, but it's
[1:32:13.600 --> 1:32:24.440]  going to take me a while to go over this medical tyranny news that is completely and
[1:32:24.440 --> 1:32:30.120]  totally synthetic and prepared and a program and an operation.
[1:32:30.120 --> 1:32:37.880]  So we know exactly where it's going, how it rolls out, how they do it.
[1:32:37.880 --> 1:32:45.480]  And to my complete and abject horror, we now know why I see hundreds of articles a day
[1:32:45.480 --> 1:32:50.680]  admitting vaccines or killing people in their AP Reuters.
[1:32:50.680 --> 1:32:54.640]  They all admit it, but say it's no big deal and it's a good price to pay.
[1:32:54.640 --> 1:32:57.440]  Then if you criticize it and show numbers, they ban you.
[1:32:57.440 --> 1:32:59.440]  So they're admitting, hey, this is going to hurt you.
[1:32:59.440 --> 1:33:03.240]  It's like Bill Gates has said, 700,000 are going to get sick or die.
[1:33:03.240 --> 1:33:05.240]  That's his number.
[1:33:05.240 --> 1:33:16.200]  And they're just getting ready to start killing people with these vaccines at higher levels.
[1:33:16.200 --> 1:33:19.680]  And then all these top medical doctors are coming out saying, this can kill you.
[1:33:19.680 --> 1:33:23.160]  These are really dangerous and they don't protect you.
[1:33:23.160 --> 1:33:28.840]  And these are former chief science officers of Pfizer and, you know, top doctors that
[1:33:28.840 --> 1:33:33.000]  advise the Canadian and British government and they're just being silent.
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:45.640]  So they're getting ready to do something really bad, folks.
[1:33:45.640 --> 1:33:50.720]  So I mean, these guys are making their move on us.
[1:33:50.720 --> 1:33:54.200]  And their view is if you're dumb enough to let a guy that says he wants to depopulate
[1:33:54.200 --> 1:33:57.520]  you, force something in your body, you deserve what he's going to do to you.
[1:33:57.520 --> 1:33:58.520]  And he's got a point.
[1:33:58.520 --> 1:34:02.440]  I mean, if you're so stupid that he says he wants to kill you and now he's coming with
[1:34:02.440 --> 1:34:06.640]  a vaccine and they're censoring you, complaining, and they go, oh, you're going to have to have
[1:34:06.640 --> 1:34:07.880]  it to buy and sell and leave your house.
[1:34:07.880 --> 1:34:08.880]  Oh, no, we're not going to do it.
[1:34:08.880 --> 1:34:09.880]  Oh, yeah, we are.
[1:34:09.880 --> 1:34:10.880]  No, we're not.
[1:34:10.880 --> 1:34:11.880]  No, yes, we are.
[1:34:11.880 --> 1:34:15.200]  So that as they implement it, you never form a resistance because like, well, I heard
[1:34:15.200 --> 1:34:16.200]  they're doing it, but they're not.
[1:34:16.200 --> 1:34:18.520]  Well, they're doing it in a limited area, but not for everybody.
[1:34:18.520 --> 1:34:19.880]  Well, actually it's for everybody.
[1:34:19.880 --> 1:34:23.800]  This is all psychological tactics and it's all the same.
[1:34:23.800 --> 1:34:28.120]  So I started wondering last year, like, why is the UN admit vaccines are actually causing
[1:34:28.120 --> 1:34:31.760]  a lot of disease and killing people?
[1:34:31.760 --> 1:34:35.040]  Because they're just going to go, we're going to hurt you and it doesn't even protect you
[1:34:35.040 --> 1:34:38.720]  and you'll start to wear a mask and you're going to have a digital passport and that's
[1:34:38.720 --> 1:34:39.720]  just the end of it.
[1:34:39.720 --> 1:34:44.000]  And oh, by the way, we're introducing legislation all over the world to forcibly inoculate your
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:45.800]  children without your consent.
[1:34:45.800 --> 1:34:50.480]  I mean, the whole dam is breaking.
[1:34:50.480 --> 1:34:54.200]  That's kind of leaks of the dam.
[1:34:54.200 --> 1:34:57.480]  You're like, hey, behind that trillions of gallons of water, it'll flood the whole town.
[1:34:57.480 --> 1:34:58.480]  Oh, shut up.
[1:34:58.480 --> 1:34:59.480]  It's not a problem.
[1:34:59.480 --> 1:35:00.480]  Hey, the leaks bigger.
[1:35:00.480 --> 1:35:01.480]  Oh, don't worry about it.
[1:35:01.480 --> 1:35:06.400]  One day you wake up and here comes 100 feet of water going 100 miles an hour, you're dead.
[1:35:06.400 --> 1:35:16.000]  The dam, it's like, tyranny is here, fields are down and we're on fire.
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  Now the good news is people are starting to wake up, but it's not quick enough.
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  Okay.
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:23.160]  And here's a whole other issue.
[1:35:23.160 --> 1:35:24.160]  Without you, we're not on air.
[1:35:24.160 --> 1:35:25.880]  It takes a lot of money around this operation.
[1:35:25.880 --> 1:35:26.880]  I want to stay in the fight.
[1:35:26.880 --> 1:35:27.880]  I want to be strong.
[1:35:27.880 --> 1:35:31.160]  I want to be able to move around the country and expose these people and bring leadership
[1:35:31.160 --> 1:35:32.160]  to this fight.
[1:35:32.160 --> 1:35:34.240]  But we can't do it without your support.
[1:35:34.240 --> 1:35:38.240]  I want to expand, not to stay the same size, but we're trying to not contract right now.
[1:35:38.240 --> 1:35:42.080]  Go to infowarstore.com, do your Christmas shopping, you know, stand in defiance of the
[1:35:42.080 --> 1:35:43.080]  new order.
[1:35:43.080 --> 1:35:44.080]  Don't buy it from the big box stores.
[1:35:44.080 --> 1:35:45.680]  They're saying you're not essential.
[1:35:45.680 --> 1:35:47.240]  Don't buy it from the big Amazons.
[1:35:47.240 --> 1:35:48.240]  Go to infowarstore.com.
[1:35:48.240 --> 1:35:53.120]  We have all the products that we have in stock ready to ship to you and promo code PATRIOT
[1:35:53.120 --> 1:35:55.800]  gives you additional 10% off.

[1:36:01.960 --> 1:36:05.320]  to sell more when we have a sale, but then it kind of evens out, but you won't buy unless
[1:36:05.320 --> 1:36:06.560]  there is a big sale.
[1:36:06.560 --> 1:36:10.400]  And so there's just sales all the time, but these are big sales with the promo code PATRIOT

[1:36:25.760 --> 1:36:28.560]  I was like, why is Prostagard like our best seller?
[1:36:28.560 --> 1:36:29.560]  Well, because it has everything you need.
[1:36:29.560 --> 1:36:32.160]  I'm like, oh, it's like women are buying it, men are buying it.
[1:36:32.160 --> 1:36:33.160]  It's great.
[1:36:33.160 --> 1:36:34.160]  People love it.
[1:36:34.160 --> 1:36:35.160]  I'm taking it.
[1:36:35.160 --> 1:36:36.160]  My wife takes it.
[1:36:36.160 --> 1:36:37.160]  It's great.
[1:36:37.160 --> 1:36:43.480]  It's 1995, super high quality, great deal, 94% reviews and infowarstore.com and Alpenpower
[1:36:43.480 --> 1:36:47.280]  is back in stock as well.
[1:36:47.280 --> 1:36:49.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope we can stop the great reset.
[1:36:49.960 --> 1:36:55.120]  That means a globalist imposed worldwide depression to break us and bring us under their control.
[1:36:55.120 --> 1:36:59.120]  Western state-admitted plan, Justin Trudeau's on record, Klaus Schwab, all the different
[1:36:59.120 --> 1:37:03.600]  Democrat mayors, they admit it's clowered in heaven, implode the economy to make us
[1:37:03.600 --> 1:37:04.600]  go under their control.
[1:37:04.600 --> 1:37:08.920]  But if we expose that they're the ones doing it, they go to prison instead of getting total
[1:37:08.920 --> 1:37:10.440]  power and total control.
[1:37:10.440 --> 1:37:14.800]  And there are major uprisings happening across the world during the U.S. thousands of sheriffs
[1:37:14.800 --> 1:37:16.720]  are saying hell no to the lockdowns.
[1:37:16.720 --> 1:37:18.520]  People are finally starting to fight back.
[1:37:18.520 --> 1:37:20.720]  But regardless, you need to get prepared.

[1:37:31.080 --> 1:37:33.920]  storeable food after the lockdown has been going for a few months.

[1:37:47.920 --> 1:37:51.240]  The globalists and their minions want to play God.
[1:37:51.240 --> 1:37:54.480]  Chuck E. Schumer, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama.
[1:37:54.480 --> 1:37:58.800]  You look at these sacks of garbage and you think, why do they hate humanity so much?
[1:37:58.800 --> 1:38:00.800]  Why do they love death?
[1:38:00.800 --> 1:38:08.480]  Because they hate themselves, they project their own disgust with their soul onto us.
[1:38:08.480 --> 1:38:13.840]  And once you understand that basic psychological point, every other answer is completely clear.
[1:38:13.840 --> 1:38:16.000]  That's why they hate info wars.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:17.120]  We believe in humanity.
[1:38:17.120 --> 1:38:18.360]  We think you're beautiful.
[1:38:18.360 --> 1:38:20.160]  We think you're amazing.
[1:38:20.160 --> 1:38:25.120]  Info wars knows you're fallen, but that you have God's potential that God gave you.
[1:38:25.120 --> 1:38:27.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, the great epic battle is now here.
[1:38:27.840 --> 1:38:28.840]  It's now upon us.
[1:38:28.840 --> 1:38:32.240]  I want to encourage you all to spread the word about info wars now more than ever when
[1:38:32.240 --> 1:38:35.280]  the enemy hopes to shut down the light of truth.
[1:38:35.280 --> 1:38:36.840]  We know you're going to override these globalists.
[1:38:36.840 --> 1:38:37.840]  We know you're going to defeat them.
[1:38:37.840 --> 1:38:41.560]  I just want to salute you all for your action, everything you've already done.
[1:38:41.560 --> 1:38:48.480]  Just God's on our side, and the globalists know it.
[1:38:48.480 --> 1:38:52.800]  The trick that social engineers use is very, very simple.
[1:38:52.800 --> 1:38:59.320]  They just teach us that the architecture of civilization, that the trajectory of a species
[1:38:59.320 --> 1:39:05.480]  is designed by these ever-knowing, loving liberal technocrats, and that if we just sit
[1:39:05.480 --> 1:39:09.320]  back and enjoy the ride, everything will be great, but then they tell us that humans
[1:39:09.320 --> 1:39:13.400]  are obsolete, non-essential, and we're bad for the earth, and we need to be phased out.
[1:39:13.400 --> 1:39:19.960]  So they're very open about what they're doing, and they count on us just being very passive
[1:39:19.960 --> 1:39:24.320]  living in the matrix-like system that they're building.
[1:39:24.320 --> 1:39:29.400]  But what defines humans more than anything from the rest of the, quote, animal kingdom
[1:39:29.400 --> 1:39:31.440]  is that we control our environment.
[1:39:31.440 --> 1:39:33.560]  We build our own environments.
[1:39:33.560 --> 1:39:34.880]  We create our own systems.
[1:39:34.880 --> 1:39:41.840]  We really geo-engineer and terraform the planet and its systems towards our aims, but instead
[1:39:41.840 --> 1:39:46.040]  we're acting like animals, and the globalists play the part of humans, and us is cattle.
[1:39:46.040 --> 1:39:47.960]  And that's the trick.
[1:39:47.960 --> 1:39:52.480]  Introducing InfoWarsLife Pure Tumeric Extract.
[1:39:52.480 --> 1:39:54.960]  This is taken under the tongue.
[1:39:54.960 --> 1:39:57.120]  It is pure turmeric.
[1:39:57.120 --> 1:40:02.120]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as
[1:40:02.120 --> 1:40:06.480]  a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[1:40:06.480 --> 1:40:10.640]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream, and then the remaining also is
[1:40:10.640 --> 1:40:12.200]  then absorbed by the stomach.
[1:40:12.200 --> 1:40:14.800]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[1:40:14.800 --> 1:40:19.360]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates, and our first product got rave
[1:40:19.360 --> 1:40:20.360]  reviews.
[1:40:20.360 --> 1:40:22.040]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[1:40:22.040 --> 1:40:24.280]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[1:40:24.280 --> 1:40:25.560]  Some like bodies better.
[1:40:25.560 --> 1:40:30.120]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more, and they fund the
[1:40:30.120 --> 1:40:31.120]  InfoWars.
[1:40:31.120 --> 1:40:37.200]  This is our new liquid turmeric extract exclusively at InfoWars.com today, an additional 25% off.
[1:40:37.200 --> 1:40:40.320]  This is a 360 win.
[1:40:40.320 --> 1:40:44.320]  Tumeric is renowned for what it does for all of our bodies, for inflammation and so much
[1:40:44.320 --> 1:40:45.320]  more.
[1:40:45.320 --> 1:40:51.320]  Get yours today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[1:40:51.320 --> 1:41:15.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:15.400 --> 1:41:20.040]  You know, I've got some really big news that we already knew, but there's been a lawsuit
[1:41:20.040 --> 1:41:24.280]  in the EU filed over it, and they've got the medical studies.
[1:41:24.280 --> 1:41:25.280]  I was just looking over it.
[1:41:25.280 --> 1:41:27.600]  Then I pulled up some of the previous ones of what they've done.
[1:41:27.600 --> 1:41:30.960]  You know, Bill Gates says that if he does a really good job of vaccines, we can depopulate
[1:41:30.960 --> 1:41:31.960]  the planet.
[1:41:31.960 --> 1:41:34.160]  Remember those quotes?
[1:41:34.160 --> 1:41:37.320]  And that's been his whole family business and all the big monies into.
[1:41:37.320 --> 1:41:41.320]  And we know the Gardasil shot ended up tagging women's ovaries and it's been in mainstream
[1:41:41.320 --> 1:41:42.320]  news.
[1:41:42.320 --> 1:41:47.200]  It's attached to not just infertility in women, but all sorts of cancers and problems in the
[1:41:47.200 --> 1:41:48.200]  ovaries.
[1:41:48.200 --> 1:41:51.040]  And that's not a fun thing for the ladies.
[1:41:51.040 --> 1:41:52.040]  It's very excruciating.
[1:41:52.040 --> 1:41:55.960]  And they've also added hormones to tetanus shots.
[1:41:55.960 --> 1:42:01.800]  The UN has been caught in India and in Kenya on the continent of Africa and other areas
[1:42:01.800 --> 1:42:04.440]  adding a hormone to the tetanus shots.
[1:42:04.440 --> 1:42:08.120]  Your body has an autoimmune response to the hormone as well, but it's only released during
[1:42:08.120 --> 1:42:18.520]  the second month of fertility or gestation of the Homo sapien sapien in utero.
[1:42:18.520 --> 1:42:21.520]  Then it causes an autoimmune response for the body to attack the baby.
[1:42:21.520 --> 1:42:23.640]  It's also a very painful process.
[1:42:23.640 --> 1:42:24.920]  And the women keep getting pregnant.
[1:42:24.920 --> 1:42:26.960]  That's a nice soft kill element to it.
[1:42:26.960 --> 1:42:30.960]  That's all the different studies, but usually a large percentage of the women end up dying.
[1:42:30.960 --> 1:42:34.500]  Because they're in the third world, so they keep getting pregnant and keep having this
[1:42:34.500 --> 1:42:37.360]  horrible autoimmune response where they lose their child.
[1:42:37.360 --> 1:42:41.800]  So it's also an incredible torture, a little loving gift from the Bill and Melinda Gates
[1:42:41.800 --> 1:42:42.800]  Foundation.
[1:42:42.800 --> 1:42:46.320]  And of course, they are the main funders of that.
[1:42:46.320 --> 1:42:57.200]  But it turns out that Dr. Wolfgang Wudar, medical doctor, has filed this and they guess
[1:42:57.200 --> 1:43:02.040]  what they found that the mRNA vaccines that Gates says is the one you've got to take.
[1:43:02.040 --> 1:43:06.520]  See, Trump wanted you to take the one that doesn't have the mRNA, which is actually
[1:43:06.520 --> 1:43:12.680]  a vaccine, still has problems, can be tainted and can give you problems causing an autoimmune
[1:43:12.680 --> 1:43:13.680]  response.
[1:43:13.680 --> 1:43:17.280]  And if you have other contaminants, your body will come allergic to those in many cases
[1:43:17.280 --> 1:43:25.800]  while they grew on peanut protein, starting in the 80s and 90s, the vaccines.
[1:43:25.800 --> 1:43:29.640]  And then of course, people that took that got violently ill if they ever ingested peanuts
[1:43:29.640 --> 1:43:31.240]  because you have an autoimmune response to it.
[1:43:31.240 --> 1:43:39.320]  So notice they don't grow the vaccines anymore in the petri-type cuter, I guess they call
[1:43:39.320 --> 1:43:41.560]  it, of the peanut protein.
[1:43:41.560 --> 1:43:46.920]  But this, you know, the mRNA, it says it goes in and changes the protein of each cell in
[1:43:46.920 --> 1:43:47.920]  the body.
[1:43:47.920 --> 1:43:49.520]  That's called cancer.
[1:43:49.520 --> 1:43:55.080]  And it says here that it will attack that exact protein is associated with SARS-CoVid
[1:43:55.080 --> 1:43:57.840]  family.
[1:43:57.840 --> 1:44:03.680]  And so that has the same protein as what's in the placenta, so your body will attack
[1:44:03.680 --> 1:44:05.680]  the placenta.
[1:44:05.680 --> 1:44:07.920]  And so the baby will never attach.
[1:44:07.920 --> 1:44:13.240]  I guess it's a little bit more humane than the tetanus way of doing it.
[1:44:13.240 --> 1:44:17.280]  So we're going to let my daughters wait till they're 18.
[1:44:17.280 --> 1:44:21.960]  And then if my three daughters, one is 16, one is 12, one is 3, we're going to say, would
[1:44:21.960 --> 1:44:23.360]  you like to be sterilized?
[1:44:23.360 --> 1:44:24.360]  That's up to you.
[1:44:24.360 --> 1:44:27.240]  If they want to be sterilized, they can go get their shot.
[1:44:27.240 --> 1:44:28.240]  God Almighty.
[1:44:28.240 --> 1:44:31.920]  This is a total violation of the Geneva Convention.
[1:44:31.920 --> 1:44:37.640]  This is a total violation of the Nuremberg Code, and this is war.
[1:44:37.640 --> 1:44:43.600]  And look, I don't want to start going around and killing people, okay?
[1:44:43.600 --> 1:44:46.120]  But I'm just telling everybody something.
[1:44:46.120 --> 1:44:50.720]  We have a duty to not put up with this and to get in these people's faces and say, look,
[1:44:50.720 --> 1:44:53.600]  you may think there's too many people, and in some areas there probably are, and there's
[1:44:53.600 --> 1:44:54.600]  some problems.
[1:44:54.600 --> 1:45:00.960]  But man, come on, you know, you got a bunch of kids, Bill Gates, so does Ted Turner, and
[1:45:00.960 --> 1:45:04.600]  you fly around in jet airplanes all day and you tell us that we need to start eating weeds
[1:45:04.600 --> 1:45:05.600]  and drinking sewage.
[1:45:05.600 --> 1:45:07.000]  Davos put that out last week.
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:11.920]  And that Obama goes to Africa and says, you can't have a car and says, you can't have
[1:45:11.920 --> 1:45:12.920]  air conditioning.
[1:45:12.920 --> 1:45:17.280]  We need to innovate out of this and industrialize these people, not sterilize them.
[1:45:17.280 --> 1:45:22.000]  But see, Bill Gates makes that joke with the mosquitoes, Ted talk, there's no reason
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:24.560]  only Africans should be getting this and getting sick.
[1:45:24.560 --> 1:45:26.360]  I'm releasing these on you.
[1:45:26.360 --> 1:45:27.640]  They're doing this to us.
[1:45:27.640 --> 1:45:28.640]  It's the same vaccine.
[1:45:28.640 --> 1:45:37.920]  So I'm going to say it, until my children are 18 and one of them is over my dead body,
[1:45:37.920 --> 1:45:41.000]  and you're not putting it me.
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:43.760]  And so what does the health minister say?
[1:45:43.760 --> 1:45:51.480]  Had health minister in Canada, had Gates man, because Canada said they went under Gates's
[1:45:51.480 --> 1:45:55.080]  control, Australia's under Gates's control.
[1:45:55.080 --> 1:46:04.240]  The UK said two weeks ago, Boris Johnson, he said, we have the rotating chairmanship
[1:46:04.240 --> 1:46:05.240]  of the G7.
[1:46:05.240 --> 1:46:08.720]  We have the rotating chairmanship of the G7 this year, and I'm going to have Bill Gates
[1:46:08.720 --> 1:46:09.720]  in there in my position.
[1:46:09.720 --> 1:46:11.880]  He will be calling the shots as the shadow minister.
[1:46:11.880 --> 1:46:13.760]  Bill Gates will be in command of the G7 this year.
[1:46:13.760 --> 1:46:16.160]  I will follow his orders immediately.
[1:46:16.160 --> 1:46:23.480]  It's all the global takeover, and they're coming for us and saying you won't have freedom
[1:46:23.480 --> 1:46:24.480]  to move around.
[1:46:24.480 --> 1:46:25.680]  That's the global social credit score.
[1:46:25.680 --> 1:46:28.560]  Remember what the Chinese minister said last year, we played the clip probably 50 times.
[1:46:28.560 --> 1:46:33.040]  He said, you won't be able to step one half foot out front of your house unless you have
[1:46:33.040 --> 1:46:34.480]  your digital passport.
[1:46:34.480 --> 1:46:36.640]  And now it's going to be a health passport.
[1:46:36.640 --> 1:46:39.480]  And they say, oh, even if you take the shots, you won't be able to travel.
[1:46:39.480 --> 1:46:41.920]  You will tell you when you can go out where you can do.
[1:46:41.920 --> 1:46:43.280]  I mean, God Almighty.
[1:46:43.280 --> 1:46:45.200]  This is the great leap.
[1:46:45.200 --> 1:46:48.280]  The great reset is the great leap forward 2.0.
[1:46:48.280 --> 1:46:53.640]  If you know what the great leap forward is, you better look it up.
[1:46:53.640 --> 1:46:56.560]  Here's the chief medical officer.
[1:46:56.560 --> 1:47:00.840]  He says Canadians who refuse vaccine won't have freedom to move around.
[1:47:00.840 --> 1:47:04.960]  Ontario's chief medical officer says that those who refuse to take the COVID vaccine
[1:47:04.960 --> 1:47:06.440]  won't have freedom to move around.
[1:47:06.440 --> 1:47:09.840]  Dr. David Williams, here it is.
[1:47:09.840 --> 1:47:15.440]  But will you, as the chief medical officer of health, in any way make some sort of mandatory
[1:47:15.440 --> 1:47:19.280]  vaccination recommendation?
[1:47:19.280 --> 1:47:25.000]  So similar to our all our immunization programs in the province of Ontario, and we have some
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:30.520]  special acts related to that, like the Immunization of School Pupils Act, et cetera, we can't
[1:47:30.520 --> 1:47:34.000]  force someone to take a vaccine.
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  That's clear.
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:39.200]  And because we want to make sure that people say they only would want it.
[1:47:39.200 --> 1:47:43.120]  And we want to make sure we have all the information they need, as well as all the safety information,
[1:47:43.120 --> 1:47:44.760]  et cetera.
[1:47:44.760 --> 1:47:50.520]  What we can do is to say sometimes for access or ease in getting into certain settings,
[1:47:50.520 --> 1:47:53.960]  if you don't have vaccination, then you're not allowed into that setting without other
[1:47:53.960 --> 1:47:56.340]  protection and promote materials.
[1:47:56.340 --> 1:48:02.800]  So what may be mandatory is proof of immunization or vaccination with a proper product in order
[1:48:02.800 --> 1:48:06.840]  to have latitude and freedom to move around in certain, like to access into long term
[1:48:06.840 --> 1:48:10.760]  care facilities or the hospital, different things without wearing other types of form
[1:48:10.760 --> 1:48:14.720]  of personal protective equipment, et cetera, same as with school attendance.
[1:48:14.720 --> 1:48:17.680]  It may be much like other vaccines.
[1:48:17.680 --> 1:48:18.680]  We haven't gone there yet.
[1:48:18.680 --> 1:48:24.200]  But we would make it mandatory for access in and sometimes being excluded if there's
[1:48:24.200 --> 1:48:25.720]  a risk or a hazard going on.
[1:48:25.720 --> 1:48:32.280]  So it's more of facility of movement and around that, not that someone is going to be forced
[1:48:32.280 --> 1:48:35.160]  to take it against the will.
[1:48:35.160 --> 1:48:40.480]  By the way, Bill Clinton's assistant has come out and said Bill Clinton was at Epstein
[1:48:40.480 --> 1:48:42.280]  Island with the little girls.
[1:48:42.280 --> 1:48:47.360]  I just wanted to mention that because Bill Clinton says, I'm going to take a vaccine.
[1:48:47.360 --> 1:48:49.320]  I'll do it on TV.
[1:48:49.320 --> 1:48:54.960]  If you believe they're going to take an mRNA vaccine that reprograms every cell in your
[1:48:54.960 --> 1:48:58.960]  body, I mean, the death, this is their move.
[1:48:58.960 --> 1:49:00.880]  I mean, they're not just going to sterilize you.
[1:49:00.880 --> 1:49:01.880]  You know that.
[1:49:01.880 --> 1:49:02.880]  You're dead.
[1:49:02.880 --> 1:49:06.520]  They're going to take five, 10 years and they've got binary things where they'll give
[1:49:06.520 --> 1:49:08.160]  you the next vaccine that triggers it.
[1:49:08.160 --> 1:49:09.640]  I mean, I've studied this, folks.
[1:49:09.640 --> 1:49:11.280]  You ever see the movie JFK?
[1:49:11.280 --> 1:49:15.920]  It's very accurate, Oliver Stone, where the whole CIA team that later kills Kennedy is
[1:49:15.920 --> 1:49:21.440]  down in New Orleans running a cancer research facility where they're injecting animals and
[1:49:21.440 --> 1:49:23.600]  humans with live cancer.
[1:49:23.600 --> 1:49:26.680]  Most cancer is viral, boys and girls.
[1:49:26.680 --> 1:49:29.400]  That's what warts are, is a cancer.
[1:49:29.400 --> 1:49:30.400]  That's all it is.
[1:49:30.400 --> 1:49:36.320]  The viral thing your immune system gives up to basically internal warts, what it is, they'll
[1:49:36.320 --> 1:49:39.080]  never tell you any of this stuff.
[1:49:39.080 --> 1:49:40.560]  And that's how they do it.
[1:49:40.560 --> 1:49:43.760]  You think they're going to take that?
[1:49:43.760 --> 1:49:49.040]  You're crazy because what it does is primes all of your reactive cells.
[1:49:49.040 --> 1:49:54.960]  Not your corneas, not your eye cells, but the majority of cells in your body, including
[1:49:54.960 --> 1:49:57.200]  your brain, and you know what gives you Alzheimer's.
[1:49:57.200 --> 1:49:58.480]  It's proteins in the frickin' brain.
[1:49:58.480 --> 1:50:02.760]  I mean, listen, listen, this is, this is, again, if Hitler would have made it to the
[1:50:02.760 --> 1:50:07.160]  old Russian, been friends, and given a medicine and had a scary virus that got out, he would
[1:50:07.160 --> 1:50:08.160]  have taken them world over.
[1:50:08.160 --> 1:50:09.160]  He didn't do it that way.
[1:50:09.160 --> 1:50:14.040]  He did it with army tanks and machine guns and fighter bombers.
[1:50:14.040 --> 1:50:19.400]  But this is all just, oh, wear your mask, oh, now don't go out without, oh, here's this,
[1:50:19.400 --> 1:50:23.520]  you can't criticize it, oh, we're going to, and then you read it, and here it is in the
[1:50:23.520 --> 1:50:30.040]  lawsuits with medical doctors laying it out, look at this.
[1:50:30.040 --> 1:50:36.200]  Section six, several vaccine candidates are expected to include the formation of humoral
[1:50:36.200 --> 1:50:45.760]  antibodies against spike proteins, SARS-CoV-2, and it goes through all the different types,
[1:50:45.760 --> 1:50:56.360]  which is derived from human endrogens, retroviruses, and is responsible for the development of the
[1:50:56.360 --> 1:51:03.360]  placenta in mammals and humans, and is therefore an essential prerequisite for a successful
[1:51:03.360 --> 1:51:04.360]  pregnancy.
[1:51:04.360 --> 1:51:13.800]  It is also found in homogenous form in the spike proteins of SARS viruses, if this were
[1:51:13.800 --> 1:51:19.120]  to be the case, would that then prevent the formation of the placenta, which would result
[1:51:19.120 --> 1:51:22.600]  in vaccinated women essentially becoming infertile.
[1:51:22.600 --> 1:51:27.680]  To my knowledge, Pfizer-BioTek has yet to release any samples of written materials provided
[1:51:27.680 --> 1:51:31.160]  to patients to basically warn them of this and the specific fertility issues.
[1:51:31.160 --> 1:51:57.160]  And then I've got all the articles, but they did it with a garntisal shot too, God Almighty.
[1:51:57.160 --> 1:52:01.160]  Now, this is undoubtedly the biggest sales of the year, it's been a year full of sales,
[1:52:01.160 --> 1:52:05.160]  because the country's in an emergency, the economy's breaking down, but I want you to

[1:52:37.760 --> 1:52:42.920]  There is an economic war taking place of the ruling class to consolidate power and control.
[1:52:42.920 --> 1:52:47.000]  There's a headline out from zero hedge that breaks down Bloomberg numbers that global
[1:52:47.000 --> 1:52:52.880]  airlines are set to lose $157 billion this year by the end of December.
[1:52:52.880 --> 1:52:56.560]  It's already over $130 billion they've lost.
[1:52:56.560 --> 1:53:02.400]  Why would they take part in the hoax, in the lockdown, in the hysteria, if it hurts them?
[1:53:02.400 --> 1:53:06.000]  Well see, that'll knock out all the small airlines and consolidate control and it's the
[1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:10.240]  same in every single industry and the big megabanks have unlimited capital.
[1:53:10.240 --> 1:53:14.880]  They want to bankrupt the world economy, go to buy it up for pennies on the dollar, that's
[1:53:14.880 --> 1:53:18.760]  why the great stock market crash of 29 later turned out was engineered by some central
[1:53:18.760 --> 1:53:19.760]  banks.
[1:53:19.760 --> 1:53:22.520]  This is how the globalists take control.
[1:53:22.520 --> 1:53:27.600]  It stars the third world to death, makes the first world poor, it's economic warfare and
[1:53:27.600 --> 1:53:32.240]  it gives cover to the big megabanks that created thousands of trillions of dollars in fake
[1:53:32.240 --> 1:53:33.240]  derivatives.
[1:53:33.240 --> 1:53:40.680]  Only the truth will set us free, infowars.com.
[1:53:40.680 --> 1:53:50.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:50.920 --> 1:53:54.280]  Coming up next segment I'll get more in the lawsuit followed by the EU by medical doctors
[1:53:54.280 --> 1:53:59.200]  reporting on the fact that the mRNA vaccine will target the placenta protein that is
[1:53:59.200 --> 1:54:05.360]  the same protein they claim is in COVID-19, yes, so you can't have the baby.
[1:54:05.360 --> 1:54:07.400]  Only imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
[1:54:07.400 --> 1:54:10.400]  But last night I decided because other people were down there protesting the day before,
[1:54:10.400 --> 1:54:15.000]  they go down to protest Mayor Adler who's gone to private jet, big parties not wearing
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:19.760]  masks but saying our businesses should be shut down and a guy was yelling at me and threatening
[1:54:19.760 --> 1:54:24.000]  me and going hey, come down here, I just went down there and got his face a little, I probably
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:28.360]  shouldn't have pulled at his mask but I got a little emotional because he was taunting
[1:54:28.360 --> 1:54:32.760]  us but here we are down there, here's some of that footage and we'll be right back with
[1:54:32.760 --> 1:54:59.760]  the latest on the sterile ones in the vaccines.
[1:54:59.760 --> 1:55:25.080]  We'll be right back with the latest on the sterile ones in the vaccines.
[1:55:25.080 --> 1:55:40.680]  Billions are starving to death over this in the future, billions have already died of
[1:55:40.680 --> 1:55:46.200]  starvation but you see a guy that's big and you make a monkey face like oh look, he's
[1:55:46.200 --> 1:55:52.320]  muscular, he's strong, my attribute is I'm a coward and I'm a slave to the New World
[1:55:52.320 --> 1:55:59.840]  Order and I go along with the system, that's why I'm so powerful, I love big tech running
[1:55:59.840 --> 1:56:05.840]  slave camps in China with 3 million people in death camps selling organs, I love Adler
[1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:11.320]  being a puppet of big tech, I love them shutting down small businesses, I love all of it because
[1:56:11.320 --> 1:56:17.000]  I'm a trendy who thinks I'm the resistance when I'm really part of the establishment,
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  there he is, look at him, that's the establishment, here I'll get down there and talk to this
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  guy, I got it, I got it right here, can you tell us how it's funny that Apple runs death
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  camps in China?
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:40.360]  Because you're a trendy local, right, and we're the bad guys, you know Apple runs death
[1:56:40.360 --> 1:56:44.400]  camps, Adler locks everything down with big tech, you work for big tech, are you part
[1:56:44.400 --> 1:56:45.400]  of the trendies?
[1:56:45.400 --> 1:56:46.400]  I'm the establishment.
[1:56:46.400 --> 1:56:48.400]  So you are, tell us, what do you work, what do you do?
[1:56:48.400 --> 1:56:50.400]  I work for Google, I'm the state.
[1:56:50.400 --> 1:56:51.400]  Oh my God.
[1:56:51.400 --> 1:56:52.400]  You work for Google?
[1:56:52.400 --> 1:56:53.400]  I'm the CEO of Google.
[1:56:53.400 --> 1:56:54.400]  Yeah, I'm the CEO of Google.
[1:56:54.400 --> 1:56:55.400]  You work for Google?
[1:56:55.400 --> 1:56:56.400]  I'm the CEO of Google.
[1:56:56.400 --> 1:56:57.400]  Yeah, that's right, what you are is a coward.
[1:56:57.400 --> 1:56:58.400]  I'm the establishment.
[1:56:58.400 --> 1:56:59.400]  Yeah, you are the establishment.
[1:56:59.400 --> 1:57:00.400]  I am.
[1:57:00.400 --> 1:57:01.400]  So are you against bigger death camps in China?
[1:57:01.400 --> 1:57:02.400]  Yeah.
[1:57:02.400 --> 1:57:03.400]  Oh you are?
[1:57:03.400 --> 1:57:04.400]  Yeah.
[1:57:04.400 --> 1:57:05.400]  Your company supports it, your company supports it.
[1:57:05.400 --> 1:57:06.400]  So you're against Apple, huh?
[1:57:06.400 --> 1:57:07.400]  You against Google?
[1:57:07.400 --> 1:57:08.400]  Hey, whoa, man, who made that cell phone?
[1:57:08.400 --> 1:57:09.400]  I actually, an officer.
[1:57:09.400 --> 1:57:10.400]  A slave made that cell phone.
[1:57:10.400 --> 1:57:11.400]  You can't do that.
[1:57:11.400 --> 1:57:18.400]  Because you're a bastard, that's what you are, you're weak.
[1:57:18.400 --> 1:57:22.400]  I think you love the censorship, don't you?
[1:57:22.400 --> 1:57:25.400]  You can run away all you want, you can lie, you can lie.
[1:57:25.400 --> 1:57:27.400]  There is no ad homo, he's weak.
[1:57:27.400 --> 1:57:33.400]  You're laughing at us when the mayor exempts himself from the rules and the business is
[1:57:33.400 --> 1:57:34.400]  going bankrupt.
[1:57:34.400 --> 1:57:35.400]  Think it's a f***ing joke?
[1:57:35.400 --> 1:57:39.400]  We're under attack, we're under siege, this ain't a f***ing game.
[1:57:39.400 --> 1:57:47.400]  Governor Abbott, Governor Abbott, Governor Abbott.
[1:57:47.400 --> 1:57:54.400]  Now a top German court has come out and said the PCR test is 96% fake.
[1:57:54.400 --> 1:57:57.400]  Almost all the COVID tests are fake.
[1:57:57.400 --> 1:57:59.400]  The hysteria is fake.
[1:57:59.400 --> 1:58:06.400]  Governor Abbott, COVID-19 is a psychological warfare weapon.
[1:58:06.400 --> 1:58:11.400]  As part of the great reset to shut down the U.S.
[1:58:11.400 --> 1:58:19.400]  economy, Klaus Schwab of the Davos Group has admitted that COVID-19 is not a threat
[1:58:19.400 --> 1:58:25.400]  and is a psychological warfare weapon to shut down the U.S.
[1:58:25.400 --> 1:58:26.400]  economy.
[1:58:26.400 --> 1:58:37.400]  Governor Abbott, come out against the COVID-19 hopes, save the Republic, don't be part of
[1:58:37.400 --> 1:58:40.400]  the great reset.
[1:58:40.400 --> 1:58:45.400]  We'll be back, stay with us and stay in attack formation.
[1:58:45.400 --> 1:58:52.400]  Back in 1996, the head of the World Food Program said that they would use food and global
[1:58:52.400 --> 1:58:56.400]  lockdowns due to a virus scare to bring in world government.
[1:58:56.400 --> 1:59:01.400]  That also came out in the North American Union documents the judicial watch and Lou Dobbs
[1:59:01.400 --> 1:59:03.400]  got more than 15 years ago as well.
[1:59:03.400 --> 1:59:07.400]  So we know they're playing and if they're able to keep this lockdown going, it's going
[1:59:07.400 --> 1:59:11.400]  to cause not just a worldwide depression, but mass starvation of hundreds of millions,
[1:59:11.400 --> 1:59:15.400]  millions have already starved to death, not from COVID, but from the lockdown.
[1:59:15.400 --> 1:59:19.400]  That's why it's important for people in North America to get prepared for all over the
[1:59:19.400 --> 1:59:20.400]  world.
[1:59:20.400 --> 1:59:26.400]  We have high quality food, ready to ship to you the last 25 years and prepare with Alex.com.

[1:59:44.400 --> 2:00:05.400]  God bless.
[2:00:05.400 --> 2:00:06.400]  Welcome back.
[2:00:06.400 --> 2:00:12.400]  I'm your host Alex Jones and our lawsuit has been filed by prestigious doctors in Europe
[2:00:12.400 --> 2:00:19.400]  laying out the fact that the mRNA vaccine attacks the same protein that is in a woman's
[2:00:19.400 --> 2:00:20.400]  placenta.
[2:00:20.400 --> 2:00:22.400]  Well, there you go.
[2:00:22.400 --> 2:00:32.400]  Just like the Gardasil shot, they now confirm attacks women's ovaries.
[2:00:32.400 --> 2:00:33.400]  Incredible.
[2:00:33.400 --> 2:00:35.400]  But they don't study it for that.
[2:00:35.400 --> 2:00:36.400]  Oh, they've rushed it.
[2:00:36.400 --> 2:00:38.400]  They've rushed it and didn't do animal trials.
[2:00:38.400 --> 2:00:44.400]  Just, oh, turns out the big M&R vaccine they have was developed in two days in January.
[2:00:44.400 --> 2:00:46.400]  Yeah, right.
[2:00:46.400 --> 2:00:47.400]  It was developed years ago.
[2:00:47.400 --> 2:00:48.400]  We found all the patents.
[2:00:48.400 --> 2:00:49.400]  Here's the articles.
[2:00:49.400 --> 2:00:54.400]  Here's the lawsuit being a big report on this afternoon for infowars.com.
[2:00:54.400 --> 2:00:55.400]  Look at it for yourself.
[2:00:55.400 --> 2:01:00.400]  And then here's some of the background HPV vaccine linked to soaring infertility.
[2:01:00.400 --> 2:01:05.400]  Tetanus vaccine laced with anti-fertility.
[2:01:05.400 --> 2:01:07.400]  Violates the Nuremberg code.
[2:01:07.400 --> 2:01:09.400]  Violates the Geneva Convention.
[2:01:09.400 --> 2:01:12.400]  This is all criminal activity.
[2:01:12.400 --> 2:01:16.400]  And the chief medical officer of Canada says you're not going to be able to leave your
[2:01:16.400 --> 2:01:19.400]  house or basically have a job unless you take the vaccines.
[2:01:19.400 --> 2:01:21.400]  He says that's not forced.
[2:01:21.400 --> 2:01:23.400]  You can just starve to death.
[2:01:23.400 --> 2:01:27.400]  Oh, but they have liability protection when you get sick from it or get sterilized.
[2:01:27.400 --> 2:01:31.400]  And they're introducing bills in the United States and other countries to allow forced
[2:01:31.400 --> 2:01:36.400]  vaccination of children without parental or child's consent.
[2:01:36.400 --> 2:01:39.400]  These are fighting words, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:01:39.400 --> 2:01:42.400]  This is the scam they're running.
[2:01:42.400 --> 2:01:44.400]  They're coming out with their new COVID-19 vaccine cards.
[2:01:44.400 --> 2:01:48.400]  They go, well, these are just in case businesses want to ask for them, even though they admit
[2:01:48.400 --> 2:01:53.400]  many people can't take vaccines because they have autoimmune problems.
[2:01:53.400 --> 2:01:59.400]  I mean, the denial that vaccines ever hurt people is just like saying, again, the sky isn't blue.
[2:01:59.400 --> 2:02:03.400]  But here's Obama saying that he might take it in public.
[2:02:03.400 --> 2:02:07.400]  And then now Bill Clinton, who's now been confirmed, was at Epstein Island with little kids.
[2:02:07.400 --> 2:02:09.400]  I just came out yesterday.
[2:02:09.400 --> 2:02:11.400]  Bill Clinton said, I'll take it, too.
[2:02:11.400 --> 2:02:14.400]  And so did George W., who's such a drug addict and lunatic.
[2:02:14.400 --> 2:02:16.400]  He can hardly even tie his shoelaces.
[2:02:16.400 --> 2:02:21.400]  So if you believe they're really going to take the shot, I've got a bridge in Brooklyn, New York.
[2:02:21.400 --> 2:02:23.400]  I want to sell to you.
[2:02:23.400 --> 2:02:25.400]  I got some ocean property in Arizona as well.
[2:02:25.400 --> 2:02:28.400]  And from my front porch, you can see the sea.
[2:02:28.400 --> 2:02:30.400]  Here is what Obama had to say.
[2:02:30.400 --> 2:02:39.400]  I promise you that when it's then made for people who are less at risk, I will be taking it.
[2:02:39.400 --> 2:02:52.400]  And I may end up taking it on TV or having it filmed just so that people know that I trust this science.
[2:02:52.400 --> 2:02:56.400]  And what I don't trust is getting COVID.
[2:02:56.400 --> 2:02:58.400]  Yeah, right.
[2:02:58.400 --> 2:03:00.400]  All these warmongering, horrible.
[2:03:00.400 --> 2:03:04.400]  He bragged about, I killed a lot of innocent people with drone strikes last week.
[2:03:04.400 --> 2:03:05.400]  I never even played the clip.
[2:03:05.400 --> 2:03:06.400]  There was a clip.
[2:03:06.400 --> 2:03:07.400]  I was like, yeah, I killed a lot of innocent people.
[2:03:07.400 --> 2:03:09.400]  It's worth a lot of damage.
[2:03:09.400 --> 2:03:16.400]  Notice you're like, oh, third world populations need it first and black people.
[2:03:16.400 --> 2:03:17.400]  Because black people die at COVID more.
[2:03:17.400 --> 2:03:19.400]  You mean because you didn't get any sunshine?
[2:03:19.400 --> 2:03:25.400]  You didn't get any D3 and black folks need more sun than white folks because your skin doesn't absorb the sun.
[2:03:25.400 --> 2:03:29.400]  Basically, your melanin blocks it.
[2:03:29.400 --> 2:03:30.400]  He didn't tell you that.
[2:03:30.400 --> 2:03:34.400]  He just said, oh, it's for black people because you're not going to be having any more kids after this.
[2:03:34.400 --> 2:03:36.400]  I mean, this is sick, man.
[2:03:36.400 --> 2:03:38.400]  This is sick.
[2:03:38.400 --> 2:03:39.400]  But it's Barack.
[2:03:39.400 --> 2:03:42.400]  It's your black president coming with that needle.
[2:03:42.400 --> 2:03:44.400]  He loves you.
[2:03:44.400 --> 2:03:50.400]  Oh, he just cares about you so much.
[2:03:50.400 --> 2:03:52.400]  You try to tell black lives matter.
[2:03:52.400 --> 2:03:58.400]  That's that that will attack you some blue.
[2:03:58.400 --> 2:04:05.400]  And it goes on and on and on from there.
[2:04:05.400 --> 2:04:11.400]  What do you think of the new COVID vaccination cards that were just revealed to the public?
[2:04:11.400 --> 2:04:14.400]  Michael Snyder asked.
[2:04:14.400 --> 2:04:16.400]  What do I think when it was all coming?
[2:04:16.400 --> 2:04:20.400]  Bush and Clinton vowed to join Obama and televised COVID vaccination.
[2:04:20.400 --> 2:04:24.400]  Former Clinton Chief A. Bill Clinton went to Epstein-Pito Island.
[2:04:24.400 --> 2:04:26.400]  Of course he did.
[2:04:26.400 --> 2:04:30.400]  Biden to launch mask up for 100 days as the cult leader.
[2:04:30.400 --> 2:04:32.400]  Yeah.
[2:04:32.400 --> 2:04:36.400]  Cuomo alleges the Trump administration created the cynicism around the vaccine.
[2:04:36.400 --> 2:04:38.400]  Trump asked his officials.
[2:04:38.400 --> 2:04:40.400]  They said, sir, it'll be ready by the fall.
[2:04:40.400 --> 2:04:41.400]  He's already had it ready.
[2:04:41.400 --> 2:04:42.400]  Trump said, OK, it's ready.
[2:04:42.400 --> 2:04:44.400]  They went, oh, he's lying.
[2:04:44.400 --> 2:04:47.400]  Now that they claim Biden's the president, they go, oh, we do have it.
[2:04:47.400 --> 2:04:52.400]  And it's totally safe. And then they blame Trump saying it's not safe.
[2:04:52.400 --> 2:04:55.400]  Remember just a month ago, Cuomo said, Trump is insane.
[2:04:55.400 --> 2:04:56.400]  The vaccines dangerous.
[2:04:56.400 --> 2:04:57.400]  Don't take it.
[2:04:57.400 --> 2:05:03.400]  Kamala Harris said on TV, I wouldn't take it because Trump's recommending it because they wanted the credit for it,
[2:05:03.400 --> 2:05:06.400]  thinking you have no memory once they put Biden in.
[2:05:06.400 --> 2:05:08.400]  Oh, yeah, you should take it.
[2:05:08.400 --> 2:05:12.400]  And now they say it's Trump that did that.
[2:05:12.400 --> 2:05:13.400]  Wow.
[2:05:13.400 --> 2:05:15.400]  That is some BS.
[2:05:15.400 --> 2:05:18.400]  Don't worry, LA imposes toughest lockdown yet.
[2:05:18.400 --> 2:05:24.400]  And they've caught the mayor and the chief manager of the city and the governor and all flying around.
[2:05:24.400 --> 2:05:25.400]  No mask.
[2:05:25.400 --> 2:05:26.400]  It's all fake.
[2:05:26.400 --> 2:05:28.400]  Hell, their businesses are exempt.
[2:05:28.400 --> 2:05:35.400]  UK police patrolling pubs, throwing out customers for eating scotched eggs.
[2:05:35.400 --> 2:05:36.400]  That's right.
[2:05:36.400 --> 2:05:37.400]  No drinking allowed.
[2:05:37.400 --> 2:05:43.400]  And if we catch you even with an egg that has flavoring of whiskey, we're arresting you.
[2:05:43.400 --> 2:05:46.400]  Yes, but the Muslims can run sex range with your kid that daughters.
[2:05:46.400 --> 2:05:47.400]  It's fine.
[2:05:47.400 --> 2:05:54.400]  Pfizer CEO, not certain their vaccine stopped transmission of COVID as companies jab approved in the UK and evaluated the US.
[2:05:54.400 --> 2:05:55.400]  Oh, so it's not even work.
[2:05:55.400 --> 2:05:56.400]  That's okay.
[2:05:56.400 --> 2:05:57.400]  It's all right.
[2:05:57.400 --> 2:06:02.400]  If you criticize that Twitter or Facebook will ban you because you're not an authoritative person.
[2:06:02.400 --> 2:06:06.400]  You know, your kid has a convulsion taken a vaccine or your brother dies.
[2:06:06.400 --> 2:06:08.400]  They take a flu shot happens all the time.
[2:06:08.400 --> 2:06:11.400]  It's like, well, okay, you're not authoritative.
[2:06:11.400 --> 2:06:12.400]  Okay.
[2:06:12.400 --> 2:06:15.400]  Let's talk about how something kills you, kills your family.
[2:06:15.400 --> 2:06:21.400]  Isn't that just precious, precious LA residents are ordered to stay in their homes.
[2:06:21.400 --> 2:06:29.400]  I told you, lockdowns coming years ago, using a virus as the pretext to bring in martial law, forced inoculation and digital tracking systems on your phones.
[2:06:29.400 --> 2:06:31.400]  People are like, how did Jones know it?
[2:06:31.400 --> 2:06:36.400]  They said they do it in operation lockstep 10 years ago.
[2:06:36.400 --> 2:06:41.400]  And that's what's so frustrating is I'm just here like I'm going to play and they go, oh, the next page is the.
[2:06:41.400 --> 2:06:43.400]  Romeo and Juliet commit suicide.
[2:06:43.400 --> 2:06:44.400]  Oh, the next page is the.
[2:06:44.400 --> 2:06:46.400]  And I'm just like, okay, now they're going to do this.
[2:06:46.400 --> 2:06:48.400]  Now they're going to do that.
[2:06:48.400 --> 2:06:50.400]  I mean, they're going to kill you.
[2:06:50.400 --> 2:06:52.400]  You think they're going to stop with just sterilizing your ass?
[2:06:52.400 --> 2:06:53.400]  Oh, no.
[2:06:53.400 --> 2:06:55.400]  You're like, well, they would never do that.
[2:06:55.400 --> 2:06:56.400]  Really?
[2:06:56.400 --> 2:07:04.400]  You read about other countries, Cambodia, North Korea, China, Russia, Nazi Germany, Venezuela, Cuba.
[2:07:04.400 --> 2:07:06.400]  They like to dominate you.
[2:07:06.400 --> 2:07:07.400]  They enjoy that.
[2:07:07.400 --> 2:07:14.400]  And there ain't nothing in the world dominating somebody like taking your life or sterilizing you.
[2:07:14.400 --> 2:07:20.400]  Last Mohicans based on Daniel Boone and real stuff that happened.
[2:07:20.400 --> 2:07:24.400]  When that end in private exterminated the Mohicans.
[2:07:24.400 --> 2:07:26.400]  He's trying to kill the chiefs of Mohicans.
[2:07:26.400 --> 2:07:30.400]  He says, now I'm going to kill your seed of your race from the earth forever.
[2:07:30.400 --> 2:07:33.400]  And that is exactly what this is.
[2:07:33.400 --> 2:07:41.400]  He pulls out that sword and he says, I'm going to wipe you and your tribe out forever.
[2:07:41.400 --> 2:07:43.400]  Your seed is mine.
[2:07:43.400 --> 2:07:45.400]  That's real power.
[2:07:45.400 --> 2:07:47.400]  And that's what evil seeks.
[2:07:47.400 --> 2:08:00.400]  How did somebody write a book 190 years ago, right after it all happened and have somebody saying, I want to kill your tribe because that's the way it always was.
[2:08:00.400 --> 2:08:03.400]  Yeah, go back to the fight scene. It's important.
[2:08:03.400 --> 2:08:08.400]  Because that's what this all is about, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:08:08.400 --> 2:08:16.400]  And if you don't figure that out, you don't have a hope or a prayer.
[2:08:16.400 --> 2:08:26.400]  The way the Native Americans operated, the way the Germans operated, the way the Romans operated, the way the Chinese operated, the way they all operated is the way it is.
[2:08:26.400 --> 2:08:30.400]  And the globalists want power over you.
[2:08:30.400 --> 2:08:32.400]  They want your seed.
[2:08:32.400 --> 2:08:34.400]  They want to wipe you out.
[2:08:34.400 --> 2:08:37.400]  Are you going to let them do it?
[2:08:37.400 --> 2:08:43.400]  I will not preside over the extermination of blacks and not because I'm their savior.
[2:08:43.400 --> 2:08:45.400]  They're coming for me too.
[2:08:45.400 --> 2:08:50.400]  They train the whites to kill the blacks so there's no one left for the whites when they come for us.
[2:08:50.400 --> 2:08:53.400]  I will not be part of this satanic evil.
[2:08:53.400 --> 2:09:00.400]  I want our children to have a future together based on competition and based on merit.
[2:09:00.400 --> 2:09:02.400]  We will rise together.
[2:09:02.400 --> 2:09:06.400]  But this system of Bill Gates and Barack Obama must be thrown out.
[2:09:06.400 --> 2:09:08.400]  Barack Obama was trained.
[2:09:08.400 --> 2:09:11.400]  Barack Obama hates black people.
[2:09:11.400 --> 2:09:16.400]  Barack Obama is a bloodhound just like Soros was trained to kill Jews.
[2:09:16.400 --> 2:09:19.400]  Obama is trained to kill blacks.
[2:09:19.400 --> 2:09:24.400]  And if you don't wake up that blacks are the first to be annihilated, you're a fool.
[2:09:24.400 --> 2:09:30.400]  And I demand, no matter what color you are, to wake up to that fact and to say no.
[2:09:30.400 --> 2:09:36.400]  We will deploy energy and systems to the world and then people will have two children.
[2:09:36.400 --> 2:09:37.400]  That's how it works.
[2:09:37.400 --> 2:09:40.400]  We will not sterilize people and murder them.
[2:09:40.400 --> 2:09:43.400]  Not without a fight.
[2:09:43.400 --> 2:09:45.400]  It really is simple.
[2:09:45.400 --> 2:09:49.400]  The left are into being deviant and I don't mean sexually deviant.
[2:09:49.400 --> 2:09:51.400]  That goes to the territory.
[2:09:51.400 --> 2:09:58.400]  I'm talking about deviant against their ancestors, deviant against their own species, deviant against the order of nature.
[2:09:58.400 --> 2:10:03.400]  Even though that deviance is destructive and poisonous, they still do it because they want to play God.
[2:10:03.400 --> 2:10:05.400]  Everything they touch, they destroy.
[2:10:05.400 --> 2:10:09.400]  Their sacrament is aborting babies and then using their body parts.
[2:10:09.400 --> 2:10:14.400]  Their religion is not taking care of the old but euthanizing them.
[2:10:14.400 --> 2:10:19.400]  The whole system is designed for the UN to keep their world countries in serious poverty and poor.
[2:10:19.400 --> 2:10:23.400]  Ballooning populations have been watching all that new fruit down the vine.
[2:10:23.400 --> 2:10:28.400]  To continually reproduce the same nightmares over and over and over again.
[2:10:28.400 --> 2:10:30.400]  They truly are the children of Satan.
[2:10:30.400 --> 2:10:31.400]  They are the children of the devil.
[2:10:31.400 --> 2:10:34.400]  And if you look at the slaves that serve the Biden and Kamala Harris,
[2:10:34.400 --> 2:10:38.400]  it really is manifested that being a slave of Satan is not profitable.
[2:10:38.400 --> 2:10:39.400]  Sin is not profitable.
[2:10:39.400 --> 2:10:43.400]  I'm Alex Jones and this is the Info War.
[2:10:43.400 --> 2:10:48.400]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic
[2:10:48.400 --> 2:10:52.400]  because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly.
[2:10:52.400 --> 2:10:56.400]  For prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth.
[2:10:56.400 --> 2:10:57.400]  And we're all this together.
[2:10:57.400 --> 2:11:00.400]  And you know, you get told having to come to you and say,
[2:11:00.400 --> 2:11:03.400]  hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[2:11:03.400 --> 2:11:04.400]  But it's true.
[2:11:04.400 --> 2:11:07.400]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level
[2:11:07.400 --> 2:11:10.400]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors.
[2:11:10.400 --> 2:11:13.400]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[2:11:13.400 --> 2:11:14.400]  They crippled all the other groups.
[2:11:14.400 --> 2:11:15.400]  And we're still here.
[2:11:15.400 --> 2:11:18.400]  And as this whole new world order comes out in the open,
[2:11:18.400 --> 2:11:19.400]  our credibility is going up.
[2:11:19.400 --> 2:11:21.400]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[2:11:21.400 --> 2:11:23.400]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[2:11:23.400 --> 2:11:25.400]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved.
[2:11:25.400 --> 2:11:27.400]  And America is still quasi-free.
[2:11:27.400 --> 2:11:29.400]  You can't have Info Wars has been proven right,
[2:11:29.400 --> 2:11:32.400]  being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[2:11:32.400 --> 2:11:35.400]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[2:11:35.400 --> 2:11:36.400]  So thank you all.
[2:11:36.400 --> 2:11:37.400]  And get an infowarstore.com.
[2:11:37.400 --> 2:11:39.400]  Get some great 2020 election shirts.
[2:11:39.400 --> 2:11:40.400]  Supplements and so much more.
[2:11:40.400 --> 2:11:41.400]  They're wonderful products.
[2:11:41.400 --> 2:11:42.400]  And they support the Info War.
[2:11:42.400 --> 2:11:43.400]  Thank you.
[2:11:43.400 --> 2:12:12.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:12:12.400 --> 2:12:18.400]  OK, I've been aware of this lady for years.
[2:12:18.400 --> 2:12:19.400]  She's doing a great job.
[2:12:19.400 --> 2:12:21.400]  But she was out there last night with us.
[2:12:21.400 --> 2:12:24.400]  And she was helping protest the mayor, Adler,
[2:12:24.400 --> 2:12:26.400]  who's flown around private airplanes and not social distancing
[2:12:26.400 --> 2:12:28.400]  and having these big parties.
[2:12:28.400 --> 2:12:30.400]  All he tells us that we're not essential and be shut down.
[2:12:30.400 --> 2:12:32.400]  And I was reminded of the fact that she got arrested
[2:12:32.400 --> 2:12:35.400]  the day before the election as an official GOP poll watcher.
[2:12:35.400 --> 2:12:37.400]  She's a lawyer in great standing.
[2:12:37.400 --> 2:12:40.400]  She's a civil litigator and currently a general counsel.
[2:12:40.400 --> 2:12:44.400]  She advises a pro bono for parental rights and families
[2:12:44.400 --> 2:12:46.400]  and as a grassroots activist for legislation
[2:12:46.400 --> 2:12:47.400]  to protect children.
[2:12:47.400 --> 2:12:49.400]  FlackTexasStrong.com.
[2:12:49.400 --> 2:12:50.400]  And she won the primary.
[2:12:50.400 --> 2:12:52.400]  She was slated to win ahead.
[2:12:52.400 --> 2:12:56.400]  And then magically, all of this gulduggery was engaged in.
[2:12:56.400 --> 2:12:59.400]  And then even the local, we'll play this piece
[2:12:59.400 --> 2:13:01.400]  coming up next segment, KXAN.
[2:13:01.400 --> 2:13:03.400]  Even local TV admitted it was BS.
[2:13:03.400 --> 2:13:05.400]  And she got hidden video of what was going on.
[2:13:05.400 --> 2:13:08.400]  So again, it's not just Georgia.
[2:13:08.400 --> 2:13:09.400]  It's not just Pennsylvania.
[2:13:09.400 --> 2:13:11.400]  It's not just all these battlegrounds.
[2:13:11.400 --> 2:13:15.400]  It's these blue cities inside red states are just as bad.
[2:13:15.400 --> 2:13:18.400]  And I know famously the county clerk's been caught
[2:13:18.400 --> 2:13:20.400]  in scandal after scandal.
[2:13:20.400 --> 2:13:23.400]  I challenged her and stuff like 20 years ago,
[2:13:23.400 --> 2:13:25.400]  the county commissioners, and they found fraud
[2:13:25.400 --> 2:13:27.400]  but said we're going to still certify.
[2:13:27.400 --> 2:13:28.400]  So that's how this works.
[2:13:28.400 --> 2:13:31.400]  So in a nutshell, we'll get into all the details.
[2:13:31.400 --> 2:13:34.400]  Again, the same exact paradigm we see around the country,
[2:13:34.400 --> 2:13:38.400]  you saw right here in the blue cesspit that is Austin.
[2:13:38.400 --> 2:13:39.400]  That's correct. That's correct.
[2:13:39.400 --> 2:13:43.400]  So I led in the primary in March as everybody knows
[2:13:43.400 --> 2:13:46.400]  the runoff got delayed until July.
[2:13:46.400 --> 2:13:49.400]  I was expected to win by pretty much everyone,
[2:13:49.400 --> 2:13:51.400]  of course, including me.
[2:13:51.400 --> 2:13:56.400]  And then the mail-in votes came in 5545.
[2:13:56.400 --> 2:13:58.400]  The early votes came in 5545.
[2:13:58.400 --> 2:14:03.400]  And all the precincts came in 5545% with me losing by 10%.
[2:14:03.400 --> 2:14:07.400]  And that seemed like a statistical anomaly.
[2:14:07.400 --> 2:14:09.400]  And so I reached out to Laura Presley,
[2:14:09.400 --> 2:14:11.400]  who works on election integrity in Texas,
[2:14:11.400 --> 2:14:14.400]  and we started reviewing the audit logs
[2:14:14.400 --> 2:14:18.400]  and found that in the July election in Travis County,
[2:14:18.400 --> 2:14:22.400]  they deleted all of our election day ballots,
[2:14:22.400 --> 2:14:25.400]  recreated four new USBs,
[2:14:25.400 --> 2:14:30.400]  and then reloaded all of those ballots for a 1.30 a.m. tally.
[2:14:30.400 --> 2:14:32.400]  So they are fixing our elections.
[2:14:32.400 --> 2:14:36.400]  They are working with and inclusion with the vendor, ESNS.
[2:14:36.400 --> 2:14:38.400]  So there's a lot of publicity out there
[2:14:38.400 --> 2:14:44.400]  that Dominion is the only fraudulent electronic voting machines.
[2:14:44.400 --> 2:14:45.400]  That's not true.
[2:14:45.400 --> 2:14:50.400]  ESNS is another election hardware and software provider.
[2:14:50.400 --> 2:14:53.400]  This is designed for the controllers to be able to engage in fraud.
[2:14:53.400 --> 2:14:55.400]  And let's not forget, LBJ was based in Austin.
[2:14:55.400 --> 2:14:58.400]  He famously stole his way into Congress here
[2:14:58.400 --> 2:14:59.400]  and in surrounding areas.
[2:14:59.400 --> 2:15:05.400]  So Central Texas is as bad as Chicago or as areas of Pennsylvania.
[2:15:05.400 --> 2:15:06.400]  Let's be clear.
[2:15:06.400 --> 2:15:07.400]  Correct.
[2:15:07.400 --> 2:15:10.400]  And honestly, because now I do work on election integrity,
[2:15:10.400 --> 2:15:13.400]  I have people from all over the state of Texas
[2:15:13.400 --> 2:15:16.400]  who report similar fraudulent activity in their counties.
[2:15:16.400 --> 2:15:18.400]  Harris County is a cesspool.
[2:15:18.400 --> 2:15:20.400]  Dallas County is a cesspool.
[2:15:20.400 --> 2:15:23.400]  And Travis County is one of the worst.
[2:15:23.400 --> 2:15:26.400]  And so we have to address election integrity in Texas
[2:15:26.400 --> 2:15:28.400]  before they do turn it blue.
[2:15:28.400 --> 2:15:31.400]  And that is the objective, the long-term objective.
[2:15:31.400 --> 2:15:36.400]  And we're incrementally losing by not addressing it.
[2:15:36.400 --> 2:15:41.400]  So November 2nd, I was appointed by the Travis County Republican Party
[2:15:41.400 --> 2:15:42.400]  to be a watcher.
[2:15:42.400 --> 2:15:46.400]  I went in with my camera, but I also wore a body cam
[2:15:46.400 --> 2:15:48.400]  and started taking pictures.
[2:15:48.400 --> 2:15:51.400]  She was illegally processing our votes again.
[2:15:51.400 --> 2:15:53.400]  I called 9-1-1.
[2:15:53.400 --> 2:15:55.400]  The sheriff showed up.
[2:15:55.400 --> 2:15:57.400]  The sheriff was unclear about his jurisdiction
[2:15:57.400 --> 2:15:59.400]  and what he was able to do.
[2:15:59.400 --> 2:16:01.400]  He chose to do nothing.
[2:16:01.400 --> 2:16:03.400]  At that point, they found out that I was taking pictures
[2:16:03.400 --> 2:16:05.400]  because I was calling the media.
[2:16:05.400 --> 2:16:08.400]  And they accused me of criminal trespass.
[2:16:08.400 --> 2:16:10.400]  And I was arrested, went to jail for 24 hours.
[2:16:10.400 --> 2:16:11.400]  It was very unlawful.
[2:16:11.400 --> 2:16:13.400]  Even though under state law, you're a lawyer.
[2:16:13.400 --> 2:16:14.400]  Let's be clear.
[2:16:14.400 --> 2:16:15.400]  I've looked at it.
[2:16:15.400 --> 2:16:17.400]  They violated the law keeping you out.
[2:16:17.400 --> 2:16:18.400]  Well, I don't know.
[2:16:18.400 --> 2:16:20.400]  I mean, they asked me to leave and I refused to leave.
[2:16:20.400 --> 2:16:22.400]  So under the law, you were by this party.
[2:16:22.400 --> 2:16:23.400]  You're supposed to be there.
[2:16:23.400 --> 2:16:24.400]  Correct.
[2:16:24.400 --> 2:16:26.400]  I had a certification to be there.
[2:16:26.400 --> 2:16:28.400]  And in my opinion, my defense would be public necessity
[2:16:28.400 --> 2:16:30.400]  that I was exposing illegal activity
[2:16:30.400 --> 2:16:32.400]  that was affecting all of the voters.
[2:16:32.400 --> 2:16:33.400]  Well, sure, exactly.
[2:16:33.400 --> 2:16:35.400]  You can have a rule against video cameras and stuff
[2:16:35.400 --> 2:16:36.400]  at a polling place.
[2:16:36.400 --> 2:16:37.400]  But if somebody's murdering somebody,
[2:16:37.400 --> 2:16:38.400]  you got to videotape it.
[2:16:38.400 --> 2:16:39.400]  Correct.
[2:16:39.400 --> 2:16:41.400]  That's an overriding whistleblower thing.
[2:16:41.400 --> 2:16:42.400]  Correct.
[2:16:42.400 --> 2:16:44.400]  So once I got arrested,
[2:16:44.400 --> 2:16:47.400]  the AG who had known about the fraud
[2:16:47.400 --> 2:16:50.400]  and the illegal activity that's happening in Travis County
[2:16:50.400 --> 2:16:53.400]  since at least September, if not before,
[2:16:53.400 --> 2:16:55.400]  in November, the AG in Texas
[2:16:55.400 --> 2:16:59.400]  finally opened a case to investigate
[2:16:59.400 --> 2:17:01.400]  the Travis County clerk.
[2:17:01.400 --> 2:17:02.400]  And that's going on right now.
[2:17:02.400 --> 2:17:04.400]  So I should have started that.
[2:17:04.400 --> 2:17:06.400]  You got arrested, but it helped trigger the fact
[2:17:06.400 --> 2:17:07.400]  that she's under investigation.
[2:17:07.400 --> 2:17:08.400]  Correct.
[2:17:08.400 --> 2:17:09.400]  Correct.
[2:17:09.400 --> 2:17:12.400]  However, although I'm excited about an investigation,
[2:17:12.400 --> 2:17:16.400]  the election for City Council District 6 and 10
[2:17:16.400 --> 2:17:18.400]  started Wednesday.
[2:17:18.400 --> 2:17:21.400]  And so here we are underway in another election
[2:17:21.400 --> 2:17:23.400]  that she is going to be allowed to steal.
[2:17:23.400 --> 2:17:25.400]  Just like the special election with the Secretary of State
[2:17:25.400 --> 2:17:27.400]  in Georgia with the mail-in ballots again.
[2:17:27.400 --> 2:17:28.400]  Yes.
[2:17:28.400 --> 2:17:29.400]  Yes.
[2:17:29.400 --> 2:17:30.400]  It's incredible.
[2:17:30.400 --> 2:17:31.400]  But just tell the viewers.
[2:17:31.400 --> 2:17:32.400]  There's people like, OK, Austin, Texas.
[2:17:32.400 --> 2:17:33.400]  It's the same thing.
[2:17:33.400 --> 2:17:34.400]  Because there's video.
[2:17:34.400 --> 2:17:35.400]  We're going to put the newscast coming up.
[2:17:35.400 --> 2:17:37.400]  I mean, you've got photos of this.
[2:17:37.400 --> 2:17:39.400]  It looks like the same stuff we're seeing in Georgia
[2:17:39.400 --> 2:17:40.400]  and other areas.
[2:17:40.400 --> 2:17:41.400]  You caught them here.
[2:17:41.400 --> 2:17:42.400]  So how are they violating the law?
[2:17:42.400 --> 2:17:45.400]  Well, there is a law that you are not allowed
[2:17:45.400 --> 2:17:47.400]  to obstruct poll watchers.
[2:17:47.400 --> 2:17:49.400]  It's a class A misdemeanor.
[2:17:49.400 --> 2:17:52.400]  So in Travis County, they forced all of the poll watchers,
[2:17:52.400 --> 2:17:56.400]  Democrats, and Republicans to stand outside of the room
[2:17:56.400 --> 2:17:58.400]  behind a wall, behind a glass window.
[2:17:58.400 --> 2:18:02.400]  And every time we would tap on the window to ask them a question
[2:18:02.400 --> 2:18:04.400]  because we're 20 feet away from the ballots,
[2:18:04.400 --> 2:18:05.400]  there's no way that they would answer.
[2:18:05.400 --> 2:18:08.400]  And again, the Project Veritas got them on tape in Michigan saying,
[2:18:08.400 --> 2:18:11.400]  we're going to use COVID as an excuse to not let them watch.
[2:18:11.400 --> 2:18:12.400]  It's the same thing here.
[2:18:12.400 --> 2:18:13.400]  100%.
[2:18:13.400 --> 2:18:17.400]  And I went as a volunteer attorney up to Wisconsin.
[2:18:17.400 --> 2:18:19.400]  They're doing the same thing in Wisconsin during the recount.
[2:18:19.400 --> 2:18:20.400]  I should have pointed that out.
[2:18:20.400 --> 2:18:21.400]  You've been all over the country.
[2:18:21.400 --> 2:18:22.400]  You're kicking ass.
[2:18:22.400 --> 2:18:25.400]  Yes, because I like to see it for myself.
[2:18:25.400 --> 2:18:26.400]  I don't believe the media...
[2:18:26.400 --> 2:18:27.400]  Well, you're being robbed.
[2:18:27.400 --> 2:18:29.400]  You're the most basic rights being robbed.
[2:18:29.400 --> 2:18:30.400]  You're pissed.
[2:18:30.400 --> 2:18:31.400]  Right.
[2:18:31.400 --> 2:18:32.400]  And I don't believe the media narrative.
[2:18:32.400 --> 2:18:35.400]  And I want all people to push back against the narrative.
[2:18:35.400 --> 2:18:36.400]  Go see it for yourself.
[2:18:36.400 --> 2:18:39.400]  If you have an opportunity to volunteer as a poll watcher,
[2:18:39.400 --> 2:18:40.400]  you should go.
[2:18:40.400 --> 2:18:42.400]  And by the way, these operatives know what they're doing.
[2:18:42.400 --> 2:18:43.400]  I mean, they act so creepy when they're doing it.
[2:18:43.400 --> 2:18:45.400]  Have you seen the Georgia footage where they're literally,
[2:18:45.400 --> 2:18:47.400]  like, close it and pull out the bags and they're, like,
[2:18:47.400 --> 2:18:48.400]  shoving them in?
[2:18:48.400 --> 2:18:51.400]  Well, I mean, they may be doing things covertly,
[2:18:51.400 --> 2:18:53.400]  but they're also doing things overtly.
[2:18:53.400 --> 2:18:56.400]  So when I was in Wisconsin and in Travis County,
[2:18:56.400 --> 2:18:59.400]  they are hostile, hostile about it.
[2:18:59.400 --> 2:19:01.400]  They will call you violent.
[2:19:01.400 --> 2:19:04.400]  They will bully you into submission so that they can continue
[2:19:04.400 --> 2:19:05.400]  their illegal act.
[2:19:05.400 --> 2:19:06.400]  Oh, that was the testimony all over the country.
[2:19:06.400 --> 2:19:07.400]  They would just throw people out.
[2:19:07.400 --> 2:19:08.400]  Yes.
[2:19:08.400 --> 2:19:09.400]  They'll threaten to throw you out.
[2:19:09.400 --> 2:19:11.400]  They'll tell you that your knees are over the line,
[2:19:11.400 --> 2:19:12.400]  that you're reaching over the line,
[2:19:12.400 --> 2:19:16.400]  that if you knock on the window, you're acting violently.
[2:19:16.400 --> 2:19:18.400]  It's bullying.
[2:19:18.400 --> 2:19:21.400]  And if we allow ourselves to be bullied,
[2:19:21.400 --> 2:19:23.400]  then we're just living under tyranny.
[2:19:23.400 --> 2:19:26.400]  And that's what big tech and big media, they're the bullies.
[2:19:26.400 --> 2:19:27.400]  They are the bullies.
[2:19:27.400 --> 2:19:30.400]  Well, and the Democrat party, and I hate to characterize
[2:19:30.400 --> 2:19:31.400]  the whole Democrat party.
[2:19:31.400 --> 2:19:33.400]  But they really have rotted from the head down.
[2:19:33.400 --> 2:19:34.400]  Yeah.
[2:19:34.400 --> 2:19:37.400]  It's unfortunate, but I do want Travis County voters
[2:19:37.400 --> 2:19:41.400]  to understand that even Democrat moderates are being robbed
[2:19:41.400 --> 2:19:45.400]  of their vote, that socialist, communist candidates are being
[2:19:45.400 --> 2:19:46.400]  raped.
[2:19:46.400 --> 2:19:47.400]  Yeah.
[2:19:47.400 --> 2:19:48.400]  The deep state wants the very radicals in.
[2:19:48.400 --> 2:19:51.400]  They want the radicals in, and that is who is being advanced.
[2:19:51.400 --> 2:19:52.400]  Jose Garza.
[2:19:52.400 --> 2:19:55.400]  Prop A even is a wave.
[2:19:55.400 --> 2:19:58.400]  No one wanted these giant trains and all this crap,
[2:19:58.400 --> 2:20:00.400]  but nobody wanted to George Soros.
[2:20:00.400 --> 2:20:02.400]  You know, gotta be the head law enforcement person.
[2:20:02.400 --> 2:20:03.400]  Correct.
[2:20:03.400 --> 2:20:04.400]  Correct.
[2:20:04.400 --> 2:20:06.400]  So folks that don't know, tell them who they're putting in
[2:20:06.400 --> 2:20:07.400]  here in Austin.
[2:20:07.400 --> 2:20:10.400]  Well, they're putting in, I mean, people ask me who's going
[2:20:10.400 --> 2:20:11.400]  to win the election.
[2:20:11.400 --> 2:20:13.400]  They asked me before the November election, I said,
[2:20:13.400 --> 2:20:16.400]  tell me who the most socialist, communist candidate is on the
[2:20:16.400 --> 2:20:17.400]  ballot.
[2:20:17.400 --> 2:20:18.400]  That's who's going to win.
[2:20:18.400 --> 2:20:20.400]  And that's who's going to win this week, too.
[2:20:20.400 --> 2:20:23.400]  On December 15th, when we get the results, it's going to be
[2:20:23.400 --> 2:20:26.400]  Jimmy Flanagan and Alter, because they're the more socialist
[2:20:26.400 --> 2:20:29.400]  candidates over Jennifer Verdin and Mackenzie Kelly.
[2:20:29.400 --> 2:20:30.400]  Period.
[2:20:30.400 --> 2:20:33.400]  It's got all the big money all over the country.
[2:20:33.400 --> 2:20:35.400]  The commies are taken over.
[2:20:35.400 --> 2:20:42.400]  George Soros will be right back to talk about stopping it.
[2:20:42.400 --> 2:20:46.400]  The globalists and their minions want to play God.
[2:20:46.400 --> 2:20:49.400]  Chuck E. Schumer, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama.
[2:20:49.400 --> 2:20:52.400]  You look at these sacks of garbage and you think,
[2:20:52.400 --> 2:20:54.400]  why do they hate humanity so much?
[2:20:54.400 --> 2:20:55.400]  Why do they love death?
[2:20:55.400 --> 2:20:58.400]  Because they hate themselves.
[2:20:58.400 --> 2:21:03.400]  They project their own disgust with their soul onto us.
[2:21:03.400 --> 2:21:06.400]  And once you understand that basic psychological point,
[2:21:06.400 --> 2:21:09.400]  every other answer is completely clear.
[2:21:09.400 --> 2:21:11.400]  That's why they hate Info Wars.
[2:21:11.400 --> 2:21:12.400]  We believe in humanity.
[2:21:12.400 --> 2:21:13.400]  We think you're beautiful.
[2:21:13.400 --> 2:21:14.400]  We think you're amazing.
[2:21:14.400 --> 2:21:18.400]  Info Wars knows you're falling, but that you have God's potential
[2:21:18.400 --> 2:21:20.400]  that God gave you.
[2:21:20.400 --> 2:21:22.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, the great epic battle is now here.
[2:21:22.400 --> 2:21:23.400]  It's now upon us.
[2:21:23.400 --> 2:21:25.400]  I want to encourage you all to spread the word about Info Wars
[2:21:25.400 --> 2:21:28.400]  now more than ever when the enemy hopes to shut down the light
[2:21:28.400 --> 2:21:29.400]  of truth.
[2:21:29.400 --> 2:21:31.400]  We know you're going to override these globalists.
[2:21:31.400 --> 2:21:32.400]  We know you're going to defeat them.
[2:21:32.400 --> 2:21:34.400]  I just want to salute you all for your action,
[2:21:34.400 --> 2:21:37.400]  everything you've already done, because God's on our side
[2:21:37.400 --> 2:21:41.400]  and the globalists know it.
[2:21:41.400 --> 2:21:45.400]  Most of the world submitted to the unconstitutional criminal
[2:21:45.400 --> 2:21:49.400]  lockdowns directed by the comics Chinese and the United Nations.
[2:21:49.400 --> 2:21:52.400]  And now because the slaves have proven themselves to be subservient,
[2:21:52.400 --> 2:21:55.400]  the worst Australian models of complete lockdowns
[2:21:55.400 --> 2:21:58.400]  so you can't even leave your house for months and months
[2:21:58.400 --> 2:21:59.400]  are being announced.
[2:21:59.400 --> 2:22:02.400]  And in Germany, the police are using giant armored tanks
[2:22:02.400 --> 2:22:05.400]  with water cannons to blast men, women, and children
[2:22:05.400 --> 2:22:08.400]  that protest the fact that Merkel, the dictator,
[2:22:08.400 --> 2:22:10.400]  has put them under her control.
[2:22:10.400 --> 2:22:13.400]  That's right, she's been rigging elections for years and years.
[2:22:13.400 --> 2:22:16.400]  And the same thing is coming here to the United States.
[2:22:16.400 --> 2:22:17.400]  This is world government.
[2:22:17.400 --> 2:22:20.400]  In Philadelphia, they've announced four people or more
[2:22:20.400 --> 2:22:22.400]  seen together will be arrested.
[2:22:22.400 --> 2:22:24.400]  They're announcing the Christmas is canceled.
[2:22:24.400 --> 2:22:28.400]  This is what the communist takeover looks like, to bankrupt you,
[2:22:28.400 --> 2:22:30.400]  to take red of all your due process,
[2:22:30.400 --> 2:22:34.400]  and absolutely transform the world into a prison planet.
[2:22:34.400 --> 2:22:36.400]  How long have we warned you about this?
[2:22:36.400 --> 2:22:38.400]  But you can fight back.
[2:22:38.400 --> 2:22:40.400]  America is the last bastion.
[2:22:40.400 --> 2:22:42.400]  Stop submitting.
[2:22:42.400 --> 2:22:44.400]  The Great Resort.
[2:22:44.400 --> 2:22:45.400]  Where have I heard of that before?
[2:22:45.400 --> 2:22:49.400]  Oh, the Great Leap Forward, Mousetown,
[2:22:49.400 --> 2:22:52.400]  ordering all the small towns and small farms
[2:22:52.400 --> 2:22:54.400]  to basically shut down and have the rural people
[2:22:54.400 --> 2:22:57.400]  and the small business people move into the big cities
[2:22:57.400 --> 2:23:00.400]  and go under communist, commune control.
[2:23:00.400 --> 2:23:01.400]  And that's all this is.
[2:23:01.400 --> 2:23:03.400]  The big mega banks want to break us into the same ones
[2:23:03.400 --> 2:23:05.400]  that put Mousetown into power.
[2:23:05.400 --> 2:23:07.400]  And they're creating the process of getting rid of our old economy
[2:23:07.400 --> 2:23:10.400]  and bringing in the new economy where everything's free,
[2:23:10.400 --> 2:23:12.400]  because when you're a prisoner,
[2:23:12.400 --> 2:23:14.400]  well, everything's free, but you're also a slave.
[2:23:14.400 --> 2:23:17.400]  Scotland is going to have universal guaranteed incomes
[2:23:17.400 --> 2:23:19.400]  now of subsistence level.
[2:23:19.400 --> 2:23:21.400]  But of course, you've got to take those vaccines.
[2:23:21.400 --> 2:23:22.400]  You can't have any kids.
[2:23:22.400 --> 2:23:25.400]  And, oh, don't worry, though, all of the tampons
[2:23:25.400 --> 2:23:27.400]  and stuff like that's free, too, as well.
[2:23:27.400 --> 2:23:29.400]  I'm not kidding.
[2:23:29.400 --> 2:23:30.400]  So they give me some free paper.
[2:23:30.400 --> 2:23:33.400]  They give me enough money to basically live in a tiny apartment,
[2:23:33.400 --> 2:23:34.400]  but they own you.
[2:23:34.400 --> 2:23:35.400]  They control you.
[2:23:35.400 --> 2:23:36.400]  That's the Great Resort.
[2:23:36.400 --> 2:23:39.400]  That's why it's got to be resisted to total takeover,
[2:23:39.400 --> 2:24:06.400]  fighting it at infowars.com.
[2:24:06.400 --> 2:24:08.400]  We got a firecracker here, Jennifer Fleck.
[2:24:08.400 --> 2:24:10.400]  Fleck, texastrong.com.
[2:24:10.400 --> 2:24:12.400]  She was saying, he's not going to run again,
[2:24:12.400 --> 2:24:14.400]  even though she almost won until the fraud stops.
[2:24:14.400 --> 2:24:17.400]  I've known Travis County done that for elections forever.
[2:24:17.400 --> 2:24:19.400]  We've seen it with the county clerk before.
[2:24:19.400 --> 2:24:20.400]  It's incredible.
[2:24:20.400 --> 2:24:23.400]  But Jennifer, we've got this newscast about you being arrested,
[2:24:23.400 --> 2:24:25.400]  which is a red badge of courage.
[2:24:25.400 --> 2:24:26.400]  Very, very great what you did.
[2:24:26.400 --> 2:24:28.400]  Now, there's a criminal investigation,
[2:24:28.400 --> 2:24:30.400]  investigation of what's happening with all this.
[2:24:30.400 --> 2:24:33.400]  You were in the right when you were exposing it.
[2:24:33.400 --> 2:24:37.400]  But big picture, this seems to be the end of the age of innocence,
[2:24:37.400 --> 2:24:39.400]  at least, all this confirmed, you know,
[2:24:39.400 --> 2:24:43.400]  handoffs of USBs and pulling out suitcases when they
[2:24:43.400 --> 2:24:47.400]  claim that the polling place or the counting center is closed.
[2:24:47.400 --> 2:24:50.400]  I mean, this is epic stuff in the mainstream media going,
[2:24:50.400 --> 2:24:51.400]  none of it exists.
[2:24:51.400 --> 2:24:52.400]  Nothing's happening.
[2:24:52.400 --> 2:24:53.400]  Nothing's going on.
[2:24:53.400 --> 2:24:54.400]  This is not true.
[2:24:54.400 --> 2:24:55.400]  No, this is Georgia.
[2:24:55.400 --> 2:24:56.400]  Look at this handoff.
[2:24:56.400 --> 2:25:00.400]  I mean, that's the daughter with the mother that's,
[2:25:00.400 --> 2:25:01.400]  you know, counting the votes.
[2:25:01.400 --> 2:25:02.400]  She's the one that brought them in.
[2:25:02.400 --> 2:25:04.400]  And we got all these handoffs and all the rest of it.
[2:25:04.400 --> 2:25:06.400]  I mean, this is just incredible.
[2:25:06.400 --> 2:25:07.400]  Wow.
[2:25:07.400 --> 2:25:09.400]  And of course, we know that's what happens.
[2:25:09.400 --> 2:25:10.400]  They take votes off.
[2:25:10.400 --> 2:25:12.400]  They go change them, bring them back.
[2:25:12.400 --> 2:25:14.400]  The central tabulation area.
[2:25:14.400 --> 2:25:18.400]  That's exactly what happens.
[2:25:18.400 --> 2:25:19.400]  Well, Trump's a Nazi.
[2:25:19.400 --> 2:25:21.400]  He deserves to have the election stolen from him, right?
[2:25:21.400 --> 2:25:22.400]  No.
[2:25:22.400 --> 2:25:23.400]  No.
[2:25:23.400 --> 2:25:25.400]  Jennifer, I want to give this newscast,
[2:25:25.400 --> 2:25:28.400]  but what are other big points you want to impart to people?
[2:25:28.400 --> 2:25:33.400]  Well, I want Travis County voters and I want Texas voters
[2:25:33.400 --> 2:25:37.400]  to wake up and understand that this isn't just happening
[2:25:37.400 --> 2:25:38.400]  in swing states.
[2:25:38.400 --> 2:25:40.400]  This is happening in Texas.
[2:25:40.400 --> 2:25:43.400]  I think we should demand that the attorney general in Texas
[2:25:43.400 --> 2:25:44.400]  do his job.
[2:25:44.400 --> 2:25:48.400]  Under the code, he's the only one that has jurisdiction
[2:25:48.400 --> 2:25:52.400]  to enforce election crimes or enforce prosecution
[2:25:52.400 --> 2:25:53.400]  of election crimes.
[2:25:53.400 --> 2:25:55.400]  And we should be asking and demanding.
[2:25:55.400 --> 2:25:57.400]  The voters should be asking and demanding a hearing,
[2:25:57.400 --> 2:26:00.400]  an in-person hearing, like they're having in Pennsylvania
[2:26:00.400 --> 2:26:04.400]  and Michigan and Arizona where Texas citizens can come in
[2:26:04.400 --> 2:26:07.400]  and testify as to the fraud that's happening in their county.
[2:26:07.400 --> 2:26:08.400]  That's right.
[2:26:08.400 --> 2:26:10.400]  And we're seeing more and more of these legislatures
[2:26:10.400 --> 2:26:11.400]  in the swing states.
[2:26:11.400 --> 2:26:13.400]  Swing states, the state the Democrats are taking over.
[2:26:13.400 --> 2:26:14.400]  Right.
[2:26:14.400 --> 2:26:15.400]  And they're in the process of Texas.
[2:26:15.400 --> 2:26:17.400]  We need to get going on this.
[2:26:17.400 --> 2:26:19.400]  We need to nip this in the bud now.
[2:26:19.400 --> 2:26:20.400]  Correct.
[2:26:20.400 --> 2:26:22.400]  And we were just talking about, we can't wait until we lose
[2:26:22.400 --> 2:26:25.400]  Texas because you can see what's going to happen
[2:26:25.400 --> 2:26:27.400]  if we wait until we're a swing state.
[2:26:27.400 --> 2:26:31.400]  We have to address the fraud now and stop it now
[2:26:31.400 --> 2:26:33.400]  so that we're not ever a swing state.
[2:26:33.400 --> 2:26:34.400]  That's the goal.
[2:26:34.400 --> 2:26:35.400]  We never want to be a swing state.
[2:26:35.400 --> 2:26:39.400]  But we also, more than anything, we want legal elections
[2:26:39.400 --> 2:26:42.400]  until we have legal elections are the horse, I call it.
[2:26:42.400 --> 2:26:44.400]  Everything else is in the cart.
[2:26:44.400 --> 2:26:47.400]  So if we want to work on pro-life issues,
[2:26:47.400 --> 2:26:49.400]  if we want to work on pro-gun issues,
[2:26:49.400 --> 2:26:52.400]  if we want to work on equal parenting issues,
[2:26:52.400 --> 2:26:56.400]  none of those are going to advance until we have legal elections
[2:26:56.400 --> 2:26:59.400]  because we won't ever be able to vote for and elect
[2:26:59.400 --> 2:27:01.400]  the representatives that care about the issues
[2:27:01.400 --> 2:27:02.400]  that we care about.
[2:27:02.400 --> 2:27:05.400]  And look, we've seen all the hoaxes and all the power grabs
[2:27:05.400 --> 2:27:07.400]  and all the scams.
[2:27:07.400 --> 2:27:08.400]  It's going on.
[2:27:08.400 --> 2:27:09.400]  They've caught them.
[2:27:09.400 --> 2:27:11.400]  And I think the naivete out there is ending.
[2:27:11.400 --> 2:27:14.400]  People are seeing the hardcore evidence of fraud all over.
[2:27:14.400 --> 2:27:17.400]  And I just don't see how they try to put Biden in there
[2:27:17.400 --> 2:27:19.400]  when it's so clear this is a scam.
[2:27:19.400 --> 2:27:21.400]  I agree it's a scam.
[2:27:21.400 --> 2:27:23.400]  But sometimes I think things have to get worse
[2:27:23.400 --> 2:27:25.400]  before they'll get better.
[2:27:25.400 --> 2:27:28.400]  There still are too many people who aren't paying attention.
[2:27:28.400 --> 2:27:33.400]  There's still too many people who are still watching mainstream media
[2:27:33.400 --> 2:27:37.400]  or who aren't informing and educating themselves at all.
[2:27:37.400 --> 2:27:42.400]  I had a voter who worked for me, who helped me on my campaign.
[2:27:42.400 --> 2:27:46.400]  And when I went back to her and asked her to help me prove
[2:27:46.400 --> 2:27:49.400]  that my election was fraudulent, she said, I can't.
[2:27:49.400 --> 2:27:51.400]  I just believe in elections still.
[2:27:51.400 --> 2:27:53.400]  I want to believe that the system worked.
[2:27:53.400 --> 2:27:55.400]  So they worshiped the naivete.
[2:27:55.400 --> 2:27:56.400]  Yes.
[2:27:56.400 --> 2:27:59.400]  But then she texted me just a week ago after all of this is unraveling.
[2:27:59.400 --> 2:28:02.400]  She texted me a week ago and she said, I'm so sorry.
[2:28:02.400 --> 2:28:03.400]  She said, I'm so sorry.
[2:28:03.400 --> 2:28:05.400]  I didn't understand what you were doing.
[2:28:05.400 --> 2:28:06.400]  And I didn't understand what you were saying.
[2:28:06.400 --> 2:28:08.400]  Well, that's because she's a nice person.
[2:28:08.400 --> 2:28:10.400]  And she keeps projecting her niceness on the people.
[2:28:10.400 --> 2:28:11.400]  That's not how this works.
[2:28:11.400 --> 2:28:12.400]  No, it's not.
[2:28:12.400 --> 2:28:16.400]  We all need to confess, admit, and absorb that we are at war.
[2:28:16.400 --> 2:28:19.400]  And we are at war for our freedom, not for our party.
[2:28:19.400 --> 2:28:23.400]  I will say equally negative things about Republicans and Democrats.
[2:28:23.400 --> 2:28:24.400]  They're all weak.
[2:28:24.400 --> 2:28:25.400]  They are all weak.
[2:28:25.400 --> 2:28:27.400]  And these big corporations are the ones doing it.
[2:28:27.400 --> 2:28:28.400]  But you just said it.
[2:28:28.400 --> 2:28:30.400]  We should put that up on the front of the interview.
[2:28:30.400 --> 2:28:31.400]  We are at war.
[2:28:31.400 --> 2:28:32.400]  Let's confess it.
[2:28:32.400 --> 2:28:33.400]  We're not looking for it.
[2:28:33.400 --> 2:28:35.400]  But let's just admit we're in a fight.
[2:28:35.400 --> 2:28:37.400]  Are we going to give up or are we going to fight back?
[2:28:37.400 --> 2:28:39.400]  And listen, fighting back's the easy way.
[2:28:39.400 --> 2:28:41.400]  Folks giving in to tyranny makes it worse.
[2:28:41.400 --> 2:28:42.400]  I agree.
[2:28:42.400 --> 2:28:47.400]  And until I go out without a mask, I go out and I usually wear a
[2:28:47.400 --> 2:28:50.400]  shirt that has, you know, a saying or words on it where people
[2:28:50.400 --> 2:28:52.400]  know I'm ready for, I'm inviting a fight.
[2:28:52.400 --> 2:28:55.400]  I very rarely get asked to put a mask on.
[2:28:55.400 --> 2:28:58.400]  But I get approached by people with masks all the time.
[2:28:58.400 --> 2:29:00.400]  And they say, how do you do it?
[2:29:00.400 --> 2:29:02.400]  How do you get away with that?
[2:29:02.400 --> 2:29:03.400]  I was there.
[2:29:03.400 --> 2:29:04.400]  I was at my dentist this morning.
[2:29:04.400 --> 2:29:05.400]  I kind of thought you might have been wrong.
[2:29:05.400 --> 2:29:07.400]  But now we all know nobody really got sick.
[2:29:07.400 --> 2:29:08.400]  It's all made up.
[2:29:08.400 --> 2:29:09.400]  I've looked at statistics.
[2:29:09.400 --> 2:29:11.400]  I was reading how the vaccines actually killing people in the
[2:29:11.400 --> 2:29:12.400]  test and they're covering it up.
[2:29:12.400 --> 2:29:14.400]  And now I'm like, okay, you're a medical doctor.
[2:29:14.400 --> 2:29:15.400]  Tell folks how he goes.
[2:29:15.400 --> 2:29:16.400]  I am.
[2:29:16.400 --> 2:29:20.400]  So it's just coming down to the fact of we have to stop
[2:29:20.400 --> 2:29:22.400]  projecting our goodness onto this evil.
[2:29:22.400 --> 2:29:23.400]  It's not.
[2:29:23.400 --> 2:29:24.400]  It's evil.
[2:29:24.400 --> 2:29:25.400]  We've put up with it.
[2:29:25.400 --> 2:29:26.400]  It's grown.
[2:29:26.400 --> 2:29:27.400]  It's out of control.
[2:29:27.400 --> 2:29:29.400]  Here's that one of the newscasts I thought was overall actually
[2:29:29.400 --> 2:29:32.400]  pretty fair with what happened to you being arrested the day
[2:29:32.400 --> 2:29:34.400]  before the election, witnessing the massive scam that was
[2:29:34.400 --> 2:29:35.400]  ongoing.
[2:29:35.400 --> 2:29:36.400]  Here it is.
[2:29:36.400 --> 2:29:39.400]  Watchers claim the Travis County clerk's office is locking
[2:29:39.400 --> 2:29:44.400]  them out, preventing them from watching the poll workers here
[2:29:44.400 --> 2:29:45.400]  counting ballots.
[2:29:45.400 --> 2:29:49.400]  State law allows these watchers to see and hear the clerk's
[2:29:49.400 --> 2:29:52.400]  office handling and counting these ballots.
[2:29:52.400 --> 2:29:54.400]  And that's exactly what Jennifer Fleck says.
[2:29:54.400 --> 2:29:57.400]  She was trying to do when she was arrested here Monday.
[2:29:57.400 --> 2:30:02.400]  Fleck is an Austin attorney now charged with criminal trespassing
[2:30:02.400 --> 2:30:06.400]  after she says she called 911 to report election code violations
[2:30:06.400 --> 2:30:08.400]  inside the Travis County clerk's office.
[2:30:08.400 --> 2:30:12.400]  Fleck was serving as a watcher here at the central counting
[2:30:12.400 --> 2:30:17.400]  station when she says she called 911 and it turns out though
[2:30:17.400 --> 2:30:19.400]  she left here in handcuffs.
[2:30:19.400 --> 2:30:23.400]  I was personally appointed by the Travis County Republican
[2:30:23.400 --> 2:30:24.400]  Party.
[2:30:24.400 --> 2:30:26.400]  So you were there on official business?
[2:30:26.400 --> 2:30:27.400]  Yes.
[2:30:27.400 --> 2:30:30.400]  Jennifer Fleck was right where she says the Travis County clerk
[2:30:30.400 --> 2:30:35.400]  told her to be held inside this media room on the other side of
[2:30:35.400 --> 2:30:38.400]  a set of windows from the ballot counting station.
[2:30:38.400 --> 2:30:41.400]  Fleck says there was one major problem.
[2:30:41.400 --> 2:30:44.400]  The poll watchers could not see information on the computer
[2:30:44.400 --> 2:30:48.400]  screens or hear anything on the other side of that glass.
[2:30:48.400 --> 2:30:53.400]  My intent was to get it recorded, to take pictures of what was
[2:30:53.400 --> 2:30:56.400]  happening and to make this situation public.
[2:30:56.400 --> 2:30:59.400]  Fleck snapped these three pictures and sent them to us.
[2:30:59.400 --> 2:31:03.400]  The pictures show, she argues, the clerk's office obstructing
[2:31:03.400 --> 2:31:05.400]  poll watchers from doing their job.
[2:31:05.400 --> 2:31:07.400]  We had no audio at all.
[2:31:07.400 --> 2:31:09.400]  We could not hear what was going on.
[2:31:09.400 --> 2:31:11.400]  They were running ballots.
[2:31:11.400 --> 2:31:13.400]  They were signing reports.
[2:31:13.400 --> 2:31:17.400]  We could ask a question or so that we could see a report which
[2:31:17.400 --> 2:31:19.400]  is allowed under the statute.
[2:31:19.400 --> 2:31:21.400]  They would ignore us.
[2:31:21.400 --> 2:31:24.400]  Fleck then called 911 asking for a deputy to file a police
[2:31:24.400 --> 2:31:25.400]  report.
[2:31:25.400 --> 2:31:28.400]  When the deputy arrived, the clerk's office found out Fleck
[2:31:28.400 --> 2:31:31.400]  had taken pictures and told her to leave.
[2:31:31.400 --> 2:31:35.400]  The other poll watchers were objecting to one poll watcher.
[2:31:35.400 --> 2:31:36.400]  She's wearing a mask.
[2:31:36.400 --> 2:31:37.400]  She's abandoned.
[2:31:37.400 --> 2:31:41.400]  She's been known as a queen of taxes of Travis County for 25
[2:31:41.400 --> 2:31:42.400]  years.
[2:31:42.400 --> 2:31:44.400]  She's been an officer since 1987.
[2:31:44.400 --> 2:31:46.400]  She administers her own elections.
[2:31:46.400 --> 2:31:48.400]  Fleck admits she violated the poll watcher agreement that
[2:31:48.400 --> 2:31:50.400]  prohibits any recordings.
[2:31:50.400 --> 2:31:53.400]  And she's ready to face the consequences.
[2:31:53.400 --> 2:31:58.400]  What made you decide to take that step to record this?
[2:31:58.400 --> 2:32:02.400]  To be honest, I was just, I'm really frustrated with the fact
[2:32:02.400 --> 2:32:06.400]  that there is no recourse for illegal activity.
[2:32:06.400 --> 2:32:09.400]  And our votes in Travis County are not being protected.
[2:32:09.400 --> 2:32:13.400]  Really, my motive was to make her do what was right.
[2:32:13.400 --> 2:32:15.400]  That didn't turn out.
[2:32:15.400 --> 2:32:18.400]  Travis County's clerk declined our request for an interview
[2:32:18.400 --> 2:32:19.400]  about the arrest.
[2:32:19.400 --> 2:32:23.400]  But during her post-election press conference, she said,
[2:32:23.400 --> 2:32:26.400]  Poll watchers are always welcome because they do a good job
[2:32:26.400 --> 2:32:28.400]  of sending the word out to everybody else that the
[2:32:28.400 --> 2:32:31.400]  procedures here and election law are being followed.
[2:32:31.400 --> 2:32:34.400]  Fleck says her recording will prove her allegations,
[2:32:34.400 --> 2:32:37.400]  but her camera is still held by the Travis County
[2:32:37.400 --> 2:32:38.400]  Sheriff's Office.
[2:32:38.400 --> 2:32:39.400]  Wow.
[2:32:39.400 --> 2:32:42.400]  If they have nothing to hide, then let us in.
[2:32:42.400 --> 2:32:43.400]  Let us do our job.
[2:32:43.400 --> 2:32:46.400]  Let us do what we're supposed to do under the code.
[2:32:46.400 --> 2:32:48.400]  They say that they want to be transparent,
[2:32:48.400 --> 2:32:51.400]  but nothing about that process was transparent.
[2:32:51.400 --> 2:32:53.400]  They don't want it during the election to be able to see the
[2:32:53.400 --> 2:32:54.400]  truth.
[2:32:54.400 --> 2:32:55.400]  Wow.
[2:32:55.400 --> 2:32:58.400]  So truly shameful, truly, truly shameful.
[2:32:58.400 --> 2:32:59.400]  And they know what they're doing.
[2:32:59.400 --> 2:33:00.400]  They run the show now.
[2:33:00.400 --> 2:33:01.400]  Yes, they do.
[2:33:01.400 --> 2:33:07.400]  And the fraud is seeping out as other county officials see
[2:33:07.400 --> 2:33:11.400]  that the county clerk in Dallas and Travis and Harris are
[2:33:11.400 --> 2:33:13.400]  getting away with what they're doing.
[2:33:13.400 --> 2:33:15.400]  It's seeping out in our smaller counties,
[2:33:15.400 --> 2:33:17.400]  like Williamson County and Hayes County,
[2:33:17.400 --> 2:33:19.400]  are having the same kinds of problems.
[2:33:19.400 --> 2:33:23.400]  Because if you can get away with committing a crime,
[2:33:23.400 --> 2:33:25.400]  why not just keep doing it?
[2:33:25.400 --> 2:33:26.400]  Nobody's holding them accountable.
[2:33:26.400 --> 2:33:28.400]  All because the public's told by mainstream media
[2:33:28.400 --> 2:33:29.400]  none of it exists.
[2:33:29.400 --> 2:33:31.400]  You know, there's mountains of evidence.
[2:33:31.400 --> 2:33:32.400]  Wow.
[2:33:32.400 --> 2:33:34.400]  We'll be right back with Jennifer Fleck.
[2:33:34.400 --> 2:33:36.400]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com.
[2:33:36.400 --> 2:34:04.400]  It's Friday.
[2:34:04.400 --> 2:34:28.400]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com.
[2:34:28.400 --> 2:34:54.400]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com.
[2:34:54.400 --> 2:35:22.400]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com.
[2:35:22.400 --> 2:35:25.400]  This is how the globalists take control.
[2:35:25.400 --> 2:35:27.400]  It stars the third world to death.
[2:35:27.400 --> 2:35:28.400]  It makes the first world poor.
[2:35:28.400 --> 2:35:30.400]  It's economic warfare.
[2:35:30.400 --> 2:35:32.400]  And it gives cover to the big mega banks
[2:35:32.400 --> 2:35:36.400]  to create thousands of trillions of dollars in fake derivatives.
[2:35:36.400 --> 2:35:42.400]  Only the truth will set us free in infowars.com.
[2:35:42.400 --> 2:35:46.400]  Imagine a dystopic novel or a dystopic science fiction movie
[2:35:46.400 --> 2:35:49.400]  where if you've had a cold, it can be locked up in your home.
[2:35:49.400 --> 2:35:52.400]  You can be taken away, you can be forcibly inoculated
[2:35:52.400 --> 2:35:55.400]  with drugs that mask greatest vaccines
[2:35:55.400 --> 2:35:57.400]  that have to change your very DNA.
[2:35:57.400 --> 2:35:59.400]  Well, that's where you are in the year 2020.
[2:35:59.400 --> 2:36:01.400]  Global government of the United Nations.
[2:36:01.400 --> 2:36:03.400]  All these authoritarian groups admit they're doing it.
[2:36:03.400 --> 2:36:08.400]  They even admit that they're doing it for power and control
[2:36:08.400 --> 2:36:11.400]  and that they're not even worried about COVID-19.
[2:36:11.400 --> 2:36:13.400]  That's what Klaus Schwab and others have said.
[2:36:13.400 --> 2:36:15.400]  Think about how insane that is.
[2:36:15.400 --> 2:36:17.400]  Oh, and big tech's got to track you.
[2:36:17.400 --> 2:36:18.400]  They've got to trace you.
[2:36:18.400 --> 2:36:19.400]  They've got to control you.
[2:36:19.400 --> 2:36:21.400]  You've got to have absolutely your house.
[2:36:21.400 --> 2:36:22.400]  Why?
[2:36:22.400 --> 2:36:24.400]  You've got to have secret police come disappear you
[2:36:24.400 --> 2:36:27.400]  because my God, this thing has one tenth of one percent chance
[2:36:27.400 --> 2:36:28.400]  of killing you.
[2:36:28.400 --> 2:36:31.400]  Give your ability to cancer or heart attack.
[2:36:31.400 --> 2:36:33.400]  This is their takeover.
[2:36:33.400 --> 2:36:35.400]  Imagine on America's dystopic,
[2:36:35.400 --> 2:36:38.400]  killed by the fear of the common cold.
[2:36:38.400 --> 2:36:39.400]  Yeah, that's fear monitoring.
[2:36:39.400 --> 2:36:49.400]  That's mind control.
[2:37:09.400 --> 2:37:11.400]  I suggest ban.video.
[2:37:11.400 --> 2:37:14.400]  You will now have ban.video app on your home screen,
[2:37:14.400 --> 2:37:16.400]  despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[2:37:16.400 --> 2:37:18.400]  The globalists think you're lazy,
[2:37:18.400 --> 2:37:20.400]  but by taking a little bit of action,
[2:37:20.400 --> 2:37:22.400]  you can override them, have the app,
[2:37:22.400 --> 2:37:25.400]  and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[2:37:25.400 --> 2:37:27.400]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech
[2:37:27.400 --> 2:37:29.400]  and click the share buttons below.
[2:37:29.400 --> 2:37:32.400]  On your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube,
[2:37:32.400 --> 2:37:43.400]  however you want, be sure and share ban.video.
[2:37:43.400 --> 2:37:54.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:37:54.400 --> 2:37:58.400]  The only two things in life that make it worth living
[2:37:58.400 --> 2:38:03.400]  is guitars are too good and firm, feeling women.
[2:38:03.400 --> 2:38:07.400]  I don't need my name in the marquee lights.
[2:38:07.400 --> 2:38:12.400]  I got my song and I got you with me tonight.
[2:38:12.400 --> 2:38:18.400]  Maybe it's time we got back to the basics of love.
[2:38:18.400 --> 2:38:24.400]  Well, it's being reported by CBS News and Fortune
[2:38:24.400 --> 2:38:26.400]  that they hit the next level.
[2:38:26.400 --> 2:38:29.400]  LA Mayor has banned walking.
[2:38:29.400 --> 2:38:30.400]  How about breathing next?
[2:38:30.400 --> 2:38:32.400]  That'll stop the COVID problem.
[2:38:32.400 --> 2:38:34.400]  Los Angeles, new COVID lockdown bans,
[2:38:34.400 --> 2:38:38.400]  most walking and use of public transport.
[2:38:38.400 --> 2:38:41.400]  See, that's how tyrants move the overs and window.
[2:38:41.400 --> 2:38:43.400]  Like, oh, you don't like staying in your house?
[2:38:43.400 --> 2:38:44.400]  How about you don't go outside?
[2:38:44.400 --> 2:38:46.400]  That's like Spain.
[2:38:46.400 --> 2:38:49.400]  So we're just being shown Australia, shown Spain,
[2:38:49.400 --> 2:38:51.400]  and being walked into the center of reflect.
[2:38:51.400 --> 2:38:53.400]  You're a constitutional lawyer, a patriot.
[2:38:53.400 --> 2:38:57.400]  That bar from turn of the Jedi launched the attack
[2:38:57.400 --> 2:38:58.400]  on the second dust art.
[2:38:58.400 --> 2:38:59.400]  You know that?
[2:38:59.400 --> 2:39:01.400]  It's a lot of commander, but I mean,
[2:39:01.400 --> 2:39:02.400]  this is obviously mind control.
[2:39:02.400 --> 2:39:03.400]  It's brainwashing.
[2:39:03.400 --> 2:39:04.400]  It's all being done.
[2:39:04.400 --> 2:39:05.400]  It's insane.
[2:39:05.400 --> 2:39:06.400]  Yeah.
[2:39:06.400 --> 2:39:08.400]  So, I mean, all of COVID, I've watched it in elections
[2:39:08.400 --> 2:39:09.400]  and I've watched it real time.
[2:39:09.400 --> 2:39:10.400]  All of us have.
[2:39:10.400 --> 2:39:13.400]  And they just, you give them a little bit of power,
[2:39:13.400 --> 2:39:14.400]  a little bit of authority,
[2:39:14.400 --> 2:39:16.400]  and they just take advantage of you.
[2:39:16.400 --> 2:39:18.400]  Well, once they know they can't be thrown out,
[2:39:18.400 --> 2:39:19.400]  they get really arrogant.
[2:39:19.400 --> 2:39:20.400]  Yeah, yeah.
[2:39:20.400 --> 2:39:23.400]  But I'll walk in HEB without a mask,
[2:39:23.400 --> 2:39:25.400]  and nobody says anything to me a lot of times.
[2:39:25.400 --> 2:39:27.400]  But then my mom will walk in and she's 70.
[2:39:27.400 --> 2:39:30.400]  She'll walk in and she'll have the mask below her nose,
[2:39:30.400 --> 2:39:32.400]  and they'll harass her the whole time she's there
[2:39:32.400 --> 2:39:34.400]  and ask her to pull her mask up.
[2:39:34.400 --> 2:39:38.400]  And it just makes me so mad because they will take
[2:39:38.400 --> 2:39:41.400]  advantage of our freedoms if you allow it to happen.
[2:39:41.400 --> 2:39:42.400]  That's right.
[2:39:42.400 --> 2:39:43.400]  Well, you're wearing a business suit.
[2:39:43.400 --> 2:39:45.400]  You look like you're kind of in charge.
[2:39:45.400 --> 2:39:46.400]  They pick on kids.
[2:39:46.400 --> 2:39:47.400]  They pick on old people.
[2:39:47.400 --> 2:39:50.400]  And it's all these minions virtue signaling
[2:39:50.400 --> 2:39:51.400]  when they're not helping anybody.
[2:39:51.400 --> 2:39:52.400]  It's all a fraud.
[2:39:52.400 --> 2:39:53.400]  It is all a fraud.
[2:39:53.400 --> 2:39:54.400]  It's all a fraud.
[2:39:54.400 --> 2:39:55.400]  And I'm always asking like,
[2:39:55.400 --> 2:39:58.400]  if we have plexiglass between the two, you and I,
[2:39:58.400 --> 2:40:00.400]  I mean, do I need to put a mask on?
[2:40:00.400 --> 2:40:02.400]  No, it's just all to remind you that you're bad
[2:40:02.400 --> 2:40:03.400]  and you're dirty.
[2:40:03.400 --> 2:40:05.400]  But again, let's stop walking.
[2:40:05.400 --> 2:40:08.400]  See, oh, before go out, exercise, enjoy yourself.
[2:40:08.400 --> 2:40:11.400]  But now, like the UK, like Australia, like Spain,
[2:40:11.400 --> 2:40:14.400]  oh, wait, you can't even go outside now.
[2:40:14.400 --> 2:40:16.400]  They want to see what we'll do.
[2:40:16.400 --> 2:40:18.400]  They want to see what they can get away with.
[2:40:18.400 --> 2:40:19.400]  It's truly sick.
[2:40:19.400 --> 2:40:20.400]  That's right.
[2:40:20.400 --> 2:40:22.400]  And most people think, well, just wear the mask.
[2:40:22.400 --> 2:40:23.400]  What's the big deal?
[2:40:23.400 --> 2:40:26.400]  You know, it doesn't really infringe on your freedoms.
[2:40:26.400 --> 2:40:28.400]  I'm like, that's not the goal.
[2:40:28.400 --> 2:40:29.400]  Do you understand?
[2:40:29.400 --> 2:40:30.400]  That is not...
[2:40:30.400 --> 2:40:31.400]  It's that you're dirty.
[2:40:31.400 --> 2:40:32.400]  You're bad.
[2:40:32.400 --> 2:40:33.400]  I mean, give me your view on this.
[2:40:33.400 --> 2:40:35.400]  Because we know it's a UN global government reset,
[2:40:35.400 --> 2:40:36.400]  collapsed economy.
[2:40:36.400 --> 2:40:38.400]  But how do you think it's going for them?
[2:40:38.400 --> 2:40:40.400]  I think it's going great for them.
[2:40:40.400 --> 2:40:42.400]  I think they're getting exactly what they want.
[2:40:42.400 --> 2:40:44.400]  I think that they're going to keep pushing
[2:40:44.400 --> 2:40:47.400]  the American people or people everywhere.
[2:40:47.400 --> 2:40:49.400]  And the big corporations are all, they're all essential,
[2:40:49.400 --> 2:40:51.400]  so they're all doubling profits.
[2:40:51.400 --> 2:40:52.400]  We're going bankrupt.
[2:40:52.400 --> 2:40:53.400]  It's just, it's modern warfare.
[2:40:53.400 --> 2:40:54.400]  That's right.
[2:40:54.400 --> 2:40:55.400]  Small businesses are closing.
[2:40:55.400 --> 2:40:58.400]  I mean, I remember reading the governor's
[2:40:58.400 --> 2:41:00.400]  executive order this summer.
[2:41:00.400 --> 2:41:02.400]  And, you know, there were like 10 exceptions
[2:41:02.400 --> 2:41:04.400]  to businesses closing,
[2:41:04.400 --> 2:41:06.400]  or that he had like 10 exceptions.
[2:41:06.400 --> 2:41:08.400]  And I remember one of them was that he closed
[2:41:08.400 --> 2:41:10.400]  all the rafting businesses.
[2:41:10.400 --> 2:41:13.400]  Like you couldn't, like your rafting businesses
[2:41:13.400 --> 2:41:14.400]  didn't stay open.
[2:41:14.400 --> 2:41:17.400]  And I thought, how bizarre that he would attack
[2:41:17.400 --> 2:41:19.400]  a small business in Texas,
[2:41:19.400 --> 2:41:21.400]  and let all these other big-
[2:41:21.400 --> 2:41:22.400]  Let's just say it.
[2:41:22.400 --> 2:41:23.400]  He's a miserable person.
[2:41:23.400 --> 2:41:25.400]  He can't, I'm sorry, he's a handicap.
[2:41:25.400 --> 2:41:26.400]  He can't go rafting.
[2:41:26.400 --> 2:41:27.400]  He doesn't want you to.
[2:41:27.400 --> 2:41:28.400]  Right?
[2:41:28.400 --> 2:41:30.400]  And we don't have to wear a mask when we're swimming.
[2:41:30.400 --> 2:41:33.400]  And for some reason, that also really bothered me.
[2:41:33.400 --> 2:41:37.400]  I'm like, what attorney wants to actually spend ink
[2:41:37.400 --> 2:41:39.400]  saying that we don't have to wear a mask when we're swimming?
[2:41:39.400 --> 2:41:41.400]  I was about to say, it's not that all lawyers are bad,
[2:41:41.400 --> 2:41:42.400]  but the nanny state ones are.
[2:41:42.400 --> 2:41:43.400]  Get rid of swimming pools.
[2:41:43.400 --> 2:41:44.400]  Get rid of diving boards.
[2:41:44.400 --> 2:41:45.400]  Get rid of merry-go-rounds.
[2:41:45.400 --> 2:41:47.400]  This is the new thing where we've got to keep you in your house
[2:41:47.400 --> 2:41:48.400]  so you're never in danger again,
[2:41:48.400 --> 2:41:50.400]  because there's always liability when you just buy into it.
[2:41:50.400 --> 2:41:51.400]  Yeah, we did.
[2:41:51.400 --> 2:41:54.400]  And I think everybody needs to start asking themselves,
[2:41:54.400 --> 2:41:55.400]  what is the end goal?
[2:41:55.400 --> 2:41:56.400]  What's the end goal?
[2:41:56.400 --> 2:41:59.400]  Like do they really want us to all stay at home
[2:41:59.400 --> 2:42:02.400]  and not go out and not interact with,
[2:42:02.400 --> 2:42:05.400]  I mean, are each other and be in relationship?
[2:42:05.400 --> 2:42:06.400]  Let's play the audio of this.
[2:42:06.400 --> 2:42:07.400]  Imagine they're beating people up.
[2:42:07.400 --> 2:42:09.400]  They're dumping water on people.
[2:42:09.400 --> 2:42:11.400]  If people don't wear their mask,
[2:42:11.400 --> 2:42:13.400]  oh, they're all little, and again,
[2:42:13.400 --> 2:42:14.400]  it gives you bacterial pneumonia.
[2:42:14.400 --> 2:42:15.400]  It doesn't protect you.
[2:42:15.400 --> 2:42:17.400]  It's totally overblown.
[2:42:17.400 --> 2:42:19.400]  96% of the PCR tests are fake.
[2:42:19.400 --> 2:42:23.400]  Portuguese courts, German courts, Brazilian courts,
[2:42:23.400 --> 2:42:26.400]  Russian courts have found they're not real tests.
[2:42:26.400 --> 2:42:28.400]  It's all based on fraud.
[2:42:28.400 --> 2:42:29.400]  But once we buy into it,
[2:42:29.400 --> 2:42:31.400]  we can't admit we've been scanned.
[2:42:31.400 --> 2:42:32.400]  Right, right.
[2:42:32.400 --> 2:42:33.400]  It's true.
[2:42:33.400 --> 2:42:34.400]  Once we've all bought into the lie,
[2:42:34.400 --> 2:42:35.400]  then we can't backpedal.
[2:42:35.400 --> 2:42:38.400]  But we need to, like at some point,
[2:42:38.400 --> 2:42:39.400]  everybody needs to decide
[2:42:39.400 --> 2:42:41.400]  what's their line in the sand, right?
[2:42:41.400 --> 2:42:43.400]  Well, imagine our children are being indoctrinated to this,
[2:42:43.400 --> 2:42:45.400]  and now they're coming with the force inoculations.
[2:42:45.400 --> 2:42:47.400]  Now they're telling us this.
[2:42:47.400 --> 2:42:48.400]  This is crazy.
[2:42:48.400 --> 2:42:49.400]  Well, and I also,
[2:42:49.400 --> 2:42:51.400]  I always think about the next generation.
[2:42:51.400 --> 2:42:53.400]  I mean, I have three children,
[2:42:53.400 --> 2:42:57.400]  and I am concerned about what we're modeling, right?
[2:42:57.400 --> 2:42:58.400]  What we're allowing.
[2:42:58.400 --> 2:43:00.400]  Oh, we're totally modeling.
[2:43:00.400 --> 2:43:02.400]  You know what the answer is,
[2:43:02.400 --> 2:43:04.400]  and I don't want to launch this at this point,
[2:43:04.400 --> 2:43:05.400]  but I'm seeing it's going down that road.
[2:43:05.400 --> 2:43:07.400]  The battle of Athens.
[2:43:07.400 --> 2:43:09.400]  Everybody's in search engine that.
[2:43:09.400 --> 2:43:11.400]  All these veterans came home to Tennessee,
[2:43:11.400 --> 2:43:15.400]  the corrupt mob boss around the town, Athens, Tennessee,
[2:43:15.400 --> 2:43:18.400]  and the veterans that knew that they'd stolen the election,
[2:43:18.400 --> 2:43:21.400]  they knew nobody supported the corrupt mayor and his mafia.
[2:43:21.400 --> 2:43:22.400]  They went and broke in
[2:43:22.400 --> 2:43:24.400]  and found all the fake ballots and proved it.
[2:43:24.400 --> 2:43:25.400]  And then that's just an example.
[2:43:25.400 --> 2:43:28.400]  The battle of Athens is where all this is going.
[2:43:28.400 --> 2:43:29.400]  Yeah.
[2:43:29.400 --> 2:43:32.400]  Well, to speak toward about veterans,
[2:43:32.400 --> 2:43:33.400]  I will say this.
[2:43:33.400 --> 2:43:35.400]  When I was, and young people,
[2:43:35.400 --> 2:43:38.400]  they're different age generations,
[2:43:38.400 --> 2:43:40.400]  but when I was knocking doors,
[2:43:40.400 --> 2:43:43.400]  whenever I knocked a door and a veteran came to the door,
[2:43:43.400 --> 2:43:47.400]  and he would have his army hat on or his navy shirt or whatever,
[2:43:47.400 --> 2:43:49.400]  and they're like war veterans,
[2:43:49.400 --> 2:43:51.400]  they would literally come to the door crying.
[2:43:51.400 --> 2:43:52.400]  No kidding.
[2:43:52.400 --> 2:43:53.400]  I'm not exaggerating.
[2:43:53.400 --> 2:43:56.400]  Crying and tearing up and asking,
[2:43:56.400 --> 2:43:59.400]  when are we going to stand up for this country
[2:43:59.400 --> 2:44:01.400]  like they stood up for our country?
[2:44:01.400 --> 2:44:02.400]  And that is my question.
[2:44:02.400 --> 2:44:04.400]  And I don't know how it's bred in me.
[2:44:04.400 --> 2:44:07.400]  I don't know if it's because I'm American or because I'm Texan
[2:44:07.400 --> 2:44:09.400]  or because I'm a flak.
[2:44:09.400 --> 2:44:10.400]  I don't know,
[2:44:10.400 --> 2:44:13.400]  but I'm not going to allow this country and our freedoms to be taken.
[2:44:13.400 --> 2:44:15.400]  And that's why I'm so upset is I'm not either.
[2:44:15.400 --> 2:44:18.400]  I mean, I know now that my cells are moving in a direction where
[2:44:18.400 --> 2:44:19.400]  it's not going to be stopped.
[2:44:19.400 --> 2:44:20.400]  It's like, it's coming.
[2:44:20.400 --> 2:44:22.400]  I'm going to, you're going to be defeated.
[2:44:22.400 --> 2:44:23.400]  That's right.
[2:44:23.400 --> 2:44:24.400]  That's right.
[2:44:24.400 --> 2:44:26.400]  And everybody can do their part, right?
[2:44:26.400 --> 2:44:27.400]  Everybody can do their part.
[2:44:27.400 --> 2:44:28.400]  You can stop wearing a mask.
[2:44:28.400 --> 2:44:30.400]  You can call your legislatures.
[2:44:30.400 --> 2:44:32.400]  You can volunteer to watch at the polls.
[2:44:32.400 --> 2:44:34.400]  You can call out fraud.
[2:44:34.400 --> 2:44:37.400]  You can ask the AG to investigate crimes.
[2:44:37.400 --> 2:44:41.400]  I mean, all of us have a part to play and we can't do nothing.
[2:44:41.400 --> 2:44:44.400]  Well, also everybody can feel deep inside that,
[2:44:44.400 --> 2:44:46.400]  especially when you're swarming up to something, you know, it's good.
[2:44:46.400 --> 2:44:48.400]  It's under attack.
[2:44:48.400 --> 2:44:50.400]  And something you love is under attack.
[2:44:50.400 --> 2:44:51.400]  You feel it.
[2:44:51.400 --> 2:44:53.400]  And we're not being taken over by something that's better than us.
[2:44:53.400 --> 2:44:57.400]  That would be, you know, we merge with, this is an evil takeover.
[2:44:57.400 --> 2:44:58.400]  This is bad.
[2:44:58.400 --> 2:44:59.400]  This is not good.
[2:44:59.400 --> 2:45:00.400]  Right.
[2:45:00.400 --> 2:45:06.400]  It's, um, I would like to think of it as being anti-American, anti-American, anti-freedom,
[2:45:06.400 --> 2:45:08.400]  anti-truth, anti-justice.
[2:45:08.400 --> 2:45:10.400]  It's not one party against another party.
[2:45:10.400 --> 2:45:12.400]  It's an attack on our country.
[2:45:12.400 --> 2:45:14.400]  That's how you have to look at it.
[2:45:14.400 --> 2:45:20.400]  And the good news is, Nevada, 400,000 disputed votes with fake signatures and all sorts of
[2:45:20.400 --> 2:45:21.400]  scams and wrong addresses.
[2:45:21.400 --> 2:45:22.400]  It's all happening.
[2:45:22.400 --> 2:45:26.400]  But what's going to happen is the evidence is now proven and the left just keeps saying,
[2:45:26.400 --> 2:45:27.400]  he's the president.
[2:45:27.400 --> 2:45:29.400]  Well, they keep saying there's no evidence.
[2:45:29.400 --> 2:45:31.400]  Like, that's what the media keeps saying.
[2:45:31.400 --> 2:45:32.400]  There's no evidence.
[2:45:32.400 --> 2:45:34.400]  And I don't know how they define evidence.
[2:45:34.400 --> 2:45:39.400]  Like, evidence is like, I watched all the hearings with the witnesses across the states
[2:45:39.400 --> 2:45:44.400]  and they said, I've sworn under oath that I will go to jail if I'm not telling the truth.
[2:45:44.400 --> 2:45:45.400]  That is evidence.
[2:45:45.400 --> 2:45:47.400]  And affidavit is evidence.
[2:45:47.400 --> 2:45:49.400]  Um, voters that are-
[2:45:49.400 --> 2:45:53.400]  And now we have all the footage of, okay, we close the polling place, we close the accounting
[2:45:53.400 --> 2:45:57.400]  center and I'll come to briefcases and they're cramming them in, I'll come to suitcases.
[2:45:57.400 --> 2:45:59.400]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[2:45:59.400 --> 2:46:01.400]  So how do people get involved in the fight, Jennifer Fleck?
[2:46:01.400 --> 2:46:03.400]  Fleck, texastrong.com.
[2:46:03.400 --> 2:46:04.400]  Everybody should be fighting.
[2:46:04.400 --> 2:46:05.400]  I agree with you.
[2:46:05.400 --> 2:46:06.400]  It's what we had you in here.
[2:46:06.400 --> 2:46:08.400]  It's not just these battlegrounds.
[2:46:08.400 --> 2:46:11.400]  It's all the states that are about to flip and take over.
[2:46:11.400 --> 2:46:12.400]  This is happening everywhere.
[2:46:12.400 --> 2:46:17.400]  Well, like I've already mentioned, I think everybody needs to reach out to their legislature,
[2:46:17.400 --> 2:46:22.400]  their house rep or their Senate rep, demand an in-person hearing so that we can grieve,
[2:46:22.400 --> 2:46:27.400]  so we can air our grievances and talk about the fraud that's happening in our own counties
[2:46:27.400 --> 2:46:28.400]  all over the state.
[2:46:28.400 --> 2:46:29.400]  Those are committees of correspondence.
[2:46:29.400 --> 2:46:31.400]  Get the intel going.
[2:46:31.400 --> 2:46:32.400]  Learn the enemy's patterns.
[2:46:32.400 --> 2:46:33.400]  Learn how they operate.
[2:46:33.400 --> 2:46:34.400]  Yeah.
[2:46:34.400 --> 2:46:35.400]  War planning.
[2:46:35.400 --> 2:46:36.400]  Yes.
[2:46:36.400 --> 2:46:37.400]  Yes.
[2:46:37.400 --> 2:46:38.400]  Be a poll watcher.
[2:46:38.400 --> 2:46:43.400]  Understand that they are exchanging USBs, creating new USBs.
[2:46:43.400 --> 2:46:45.400]  There's vendors on the-
[2:46:45.400 --> 2:46:46.400]  On the machines.
[2:46:46.400 --> 2:46:47.400]  Look, we're better than the enemy.
[2:46:47.400 --> 2:46:49.400]  We start politically war planning.
[2:46:49.400 --> 2:46:51.400]  We get all the facts better than they got.
[2:46:51.400 --> 2:46:52.400]  We're going to get them.
[2:46:52.400 --> 2:46:53.400]  Yeah.
[2:46:53.400 --> 2:46:54.400]  We just have to learn this.
[2:46:54.400 --> 2:46:55.400]  We got to get into it.
[2:46:55.400 --> 2:47:00.400]  And we also need to leverage the Texas Republican Party or the Republican Party of Texas.
[2:47:00.400 --> 2:47:02.400]  They should be taking a stand for our state.
[2:47:02.400 --> 2:47:04.400]  They should be taking a stand for the voters.
[2:47:04.400 --> 2:47:05.400]  No, I totally agree.
[2:47:05.400 --> 2:47:07.400]  I'm going to let you host five minutes.
[2:47:07.400 --> 2:47:11.400]  I've got to go to a meeting, and then I'm going to come back and be on some shows today
[2:47:11.400 --> 2:47:12.400]  in the war room.
[2:47:12.400 --> 2:47:17.400]  We have a little five-minute segment coming up, so I've got to go, but I want you to do
[2:47:17.400 --> 2:47:18.400]  five minutes.
[2:47:18.400 --> 2:47:21.400]  We've got Dr. Nick Baggots taking over.
[2:47:21.400 --> 2:47:24.400]  We're going to air my Shanghai election piece.
[2:47:24.400 --> 2:47:29.400]  It's so important that John Bowne put out at six after, and then things will be taken
[2:47:29.400 --> 2:47:31.400]  over by Dr. Nick Baggots.
[2:47:31.400 --> 2:47:34.400]  But I want to really appreciate you, Jennifer, and I appreciate you coming out.
[2:47:34.400 --> 2:47:36.400]  Fleck, texastrong.com.
[2:47:36.400 --> 2:47:40.400]  Remember, listeners, the way we override the globalist is you tell people about Bandot
[2:47:40.400 --> 2:47:44.400]  Video and infowars.com and that the truth is there and that America is fighting back
[2:47:44.400 --> 2:47:46.400]  and that our greatest hour is yet to come.
[2:47:46.400 --> 2:47:50.400]  We've only begun to fight and get the products at infowars.com.
[2:47:50.400 --> 2:47:54.400]  We had to build the satellite uplinks, the radio uplinks, the infrastructure, everything.
[2:47:54.400 --> 2:47:57.400]  Ahead of the deplatforming, I knew it was coming, and I told you it was.
[2:47:57.400 --> 2:47:58.400]  I started the enemy.
[2:47:58.400 --> 2:47:59.400]  We're here now.
[2:47:59.400 --> 2:48:02.400]  We're going to become more important as the shutdown happens everywhere.
[2:48:02.400 --> 2:48:06.400]  It's going to be some dark hours ahead, but if you finance us and get great products
[2:48:06.400 --> 2:48:09.400]  at the same time at infowars.com, use promo code PATRIOT.
[2:48:09.400 --> 2:48:10.400]  We've only got a few days left of that.

[2:48:25.400 --> 2:48:26.400]  infowars.com.
[2:48:26.400 --> 2:48:27.400]  Hour number four.
[2:48:27.400 --> 2:48:28.400]  Straight ahead.
[2:48:28.400 --> 2:48:31.400]  Stay with us.
[2:48:31.400 --> 2:48:34.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope we can stop the great reset.
[2:48:34.400 --> 2:48:39.400]  That means a globalist imposed worldwide depression to break us and bring us under their control.
[2:48:39.400 --> 2:48:40.400]  That's their state-admitted plan.
[2:48:40.400 --> 2:48:44.400]  Justin Trudeau's on record, Klaus Schwab, all the different Democrat mayors.
[2:48:44.400 --> 2:48:48.400]  They admit it's clowered in heaven, implode the economy to make us go under their control.
[2:48:48.400 --> 2:48:53.400]  But if we expose they're the ones doing it, they go to prison instead of getting total
[2:48:53.400 --> 2:48:54.400]  power and total control.
[2:48:54.400 --> 2:48:57.400]  And there are major uprisings happening across the world.
[2:48:57.400 --> 2:48:58.400]  You're in the U.S.
[2:48:58.400 --> 2:49:00.400]  Thousands of sheriffs are saying hell no to the lockdowns.
[2:49:00.400 --> 2:49:02.400]  People are finally starting to fight back.
[2:49:02.400 --> 2:49:04.400]  But regardless, you need to get prepared.

[2:49:11.400 --> 2:49:15.400]  But when people figure this out in a few months, I think there'll be long lines again to get
[2:49:15.400 --> 2:49:18.400]  swarble food after the lockdown has been going for a few months.
[2:49:18.400 --> 2:49:21.400]  So get your orders in today at PrepareWithAlex.com.

[2:49:28.400 --> 2:49:32.400]  So get your orders in now, PrepareWithAlex.com.
[2:49:32.400 --> 2:49:37.400]  Throughout history, there have been two basic forms of civilizations and different mixes of the two.
[2:49:37.400 --> 2:49:40.400]  One is born of Renaissance, the other is born of conquest.
[2:49:40.400 --> 2:49:46.400]  One bases its power on having strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture.
[2:49:46.400 --> 2:49:49.400]  An ingenuity, art and skill and strength.
[2:49:49.400 --> 2:49:55.400]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above it.
[2:49:55.400 --> 2:50:00.400]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom
[2:50:00.400 --> 2:50:04.400]  into one of total mass high-tech slavery.
[2:50:04.400 --> 2:50:07.400]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[2:50:07.400 --> 2:50:12.400]  They point out one of our evils so they can invert the fact that they are truly the slave masters.
[2:50:12.400 --> 2:50:14.400]  A global permanent lockdown is here.
[2:50:14.400 --> 2:50:17.400]  It is already causing millions and millions to starve to death.
[2:50:17.400 --> 2:50:19.400]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[2:50:19.400 --> 2:50:22.400]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England,
[2:50:22.400 --> 2:50:27.400]  and a top general, have come out and said the coming lockdown is going to trigger a giant New World War.
[2:50:27.400 --> 2:50:31.400]  That's the facts. This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.
[2:50:31.400 --> 2:50:38.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:51:02.400 --> 2:51:05.400]  Welcome back to Info Wars.
[2:51:05.400 --> 2:51:07.400]  My name is Jennifer Fleck.
[2:51:07.400 --> 2:51:10.400]  I was a guest on Alex's show this afternoon,
[2:51:10.400 --> 2:51:14.400]  and he invited me to come back and speak for about five more minutes about
[2:51:14.400 --> 2:51:20.400]  what voters can do in Texas in order to get election integrity and work on election integrity.
[2:51:20.400 --> 2:51:28.400]  As I've said earlier, just because Texas is not a swing state does not mean that our elections are not being stolen.
[2:51:28.400 --> 2:51:35.400]  I know that stolen might sound like a radicalized word, but I have experienced it myself.
[2:51:35.400 --> 2:51:38.400]  I've looked at audit logs. I've been there in person.
[2:51:38.400 --> 2:51:40.400]  I know that it's happening.
[2:51:40.400 --> 2:51:45.400]  Trust me when I say that we are experiencing election fraud.
[2:51:45.400 --> 2:51:47.400]  It's not just happening in Travis County.
[2:51:47.400 --> 2:51:49.400]  It's happening in Hayes County.
[2:51:49.400 --> 2:51:54.400]  It's happening in Williamson County, in Dallas County, in Harris County, and in Bear County.
[2:51:54.400 --> 2:52:00.400]  I have people from even the smaller counties, Port Aransas County and a Gillespie County,
[2:52:00.400 --> 2:52:06.400]  who reach out to me and say they showed up to vote and they were told they had already voted,
[2:52:06.400 --> 2:52:11.400]  or they showed up to vote and the candidates that were supposed to be on their ballot weren't on their ballot.
[2:52:11.400 --> 2:52:14.400]  They had the wrong ballot style that's happening in Williamson County.
[2:52:14.400 --> 2:52:17.400]  Those things do affect races.
[2:52:17.400 --> 2:52:19.400]  We have to do something about it.
[2:52:19.400 --> 2:52:22.400]  We cannot wait until we've lost our state.
[2:52:22.400 --> 2:52:24.400]  We have to do something about it now.
[2:52:24.400 --> 2:52:27.400]  We have to be proactive and we have to be patriots.
[2:52:27.400 --> 2:52:35.400]  That's what we need to be, patriots, Texans, fighters, people who are willing to sacrifice for liberty, justice and truth.
[2:52:35.400 --> 2:52:37.400]  So things that we can all do.
[2:52:37.400 --> 2:52:42.400]  So I would recommend that you reach out to Colonel Allen West.
[2:52:42.400 --> 2:52:46.400]  He's the Texas Republican Party Chair.
[2:52:46.400 --> 2:52:52.400]  He has a platform in which he can influence our legislature, hopefully, to conduct an in-person hearing
[2:52:52.400 --> 2:52:57.400]  so that we can go and testify as to the fraud that's happening in our counties,
[2:52:57.400 --> 2:53:03.400]  that we can make those things known, that we can dispel any myths or agendas or narratives
[2:53:03.400 --> 2:53:08.400]  that wants us to believe that this isn't happening, that we have a conservative government in Texas.
[2:53:08.400 --> 2:53:09.400]  We do not.
[2:53:09.400 --> 2:53:11.400]  We do not have a conservative government in Texas.
[2:53:11.400 --> 2:53:14.400]  We have a lazy government in Texas.
[2:53:14.400 --> 2:53:21.400]  Although it's Republican, majority Republican, it's lazy, it's complicit, possibly, and it's complacent.
[2:53:21.400 --> 2:53:26.400]  They don't do what they need to do to protect our votes and to protect our elections.
[2:53:26.400 --> 2:53:28.400]  And we deserve better.
[2:53:28.400 --> 2:53:35.400]  The American people, the citizens and the voters in this state and in this country deserve better.
[2:53:35.400 --> 2:53:37.400]  We deserve to have our votes counted.
[2:53:37.400 --> 2:53:42.400]  Remember the saying, it doesn't matter who votes, it matters who counts the votes.
[2:53:42.400 --> 2:53:46.400]  So those people need to be held accountable to the law.
[2:53:46.400 --> 2:53:48.400]  So we have great election law in Texas.
[2:53:48.400 --> 2:53:52.400]  It could be stronger, but it's not terrible if you read it.
[2:53:52.400 --> 2:53:54.400]  However, it's not followed.
[2:53:54.400 --> 2:53:59.400]  Many of the county officials across the state just don't follow Texas law.
[2:53:59.400 --> 2:54:05.400]  And the only person with jurisdiction to prosecute or to prosecute those crimes is our AG.
[2:54:05.400 --> 2:54:08.400]  And so AG Paxson needs to step up.
[2:54:08.400 --> 2:54:12.400]  He needs to step up, he needs to investigate these crimes that are being alleged,
[2:54:12.400 --> 2:54:16.400]  and he needs to do something about it, remove these people.
[2:54:16.400 --> 2:54:23.400]  In Travis County, obstructing poll watchers, which didn't just happen in Travis County, it also happened in Harris County,
[2:54:23.400 --> 2:54:25.400]  is a class A misdemeanor.
[2:54:25.400 --> 2:54:29.400]  You can go to jail for one year for obstructing poll watchers.
[2:54:29.400 --> 2:54:31.400]  That needs to happen.
[2:54:31.400 --> 2:54:38.400]  Because you know what, when it happens once, when one Travis County official goes to jail for a year or more,
[2:54:38.400 --> 2:54:39.400]  then guess what?
[2:54:39.400 --> 2:54:42.400]  It puts the fear into other officials across the state.
[2:54:42.400 --> 2:54:46.400]  And hopefully, prayerfully, they stop breaking the law.
[2:54:46.400 --> 2:54:48.400]  They stop cheating the voters.
[2:54:48.400 --> 2:54:50.400]  And we can get our state back.
[2:54:50.400 --> 2:54:58.400]  I ask every day, every day, I say, Lord, what do we need to do to get our state back?
[2:54:58.400 --> 2:54:59.400]  What do we need to do?
[2:54:59.400 --> 2:55:03.400]  What do we need to do to make people do their job?
[2:55:03.400 --> 2:55:05.400]  They don't, they're not doing their job.
[2:55:05.400 --> 2:55:11.400]  And there's only a few people that can do, that have jurisdiction over election crimes, and that's our AG.
[2:55:11.400 --> 2:55:18.400]  So I encourage people to reach out to the AG, reach out to your legislators, ask for an in-person hearing,
[2:55:18.400 --> 2:55:23.400]  reach out to the Republican Party of Texas, ask them to weigh in,
[2:55:23.400 --> 2:55:32.400]  reach out to your county chair, ask them to publicly and loudly demand that your votes count.
[2:55:32.400 --> 2:56:01.400]  Thank you.
[2:56:03.400 --> 2:56:09.400]  We have their whole great catalog at infowarstore.com where you can normally get it at very good prices,
[2:56:09.400 --> 2:56:10.400]  and those prices are still there.
[2:56:10.400 --> 2:56:17.400]  But an additional 10% off right now at preparewithoutlets.com on their one month, their three month,
[2:56:17.400 --> 2:56:25.400]  their six month, their year, and on a bunch of other great items, huge discounts that will be ending next Wednesday.
[2:56:25.400 --> 2:56:27.400]  That is December 2nd.
[2:56:27.400 --> 2:56:33.400]  So you've got this week and a little bit of next week to get your orders in, they're ready to ship to you right now,
[2:56:33.400 --> 2:56:36.400]  and the profit that comes in funds the info war, so it's a 360 win.
[2:56:36.400 --> 2:56:39.400]  If you need horrible food to fight the great reset, get prepared now.
[2:56:39.400 --> 2:57:02.400]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:57:02.400 --> 2:57:11.400]  Live from the info wars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:57:11.400 --> 2:57:20.400]  The SEC documents shining a blinding light on the architects of the 2020 election fraud are available for anyone to see,
[2:57:20.400 --> 2:57:23.400]  but the mainstream media won't touch it with a 10 foot pole.
[2:57:23.400 --> 2:57:25.400]  It would be career suicide.
[2:57:25.400 --> 2:57:32.400]  The conspiracy theories have exploded online during the pandemic and in the days leading up to the election.
[2:57:32.400 --> 2:57:37.400]  Researchers say voters are being bombarded with false narratives intended to cause fear and disorder.
[2:57:37.400 --> 2:57:45.400]  Election interference and targeted disinformation campaigns on voter fraud are a real threat in the upcoming U.S. election.
[2:57:45.400 --> 2:57:47.400]  Voter fraud is extremely rare in the United States.
[2:57:47.400 --> 2:57:48.400]  That's what all the experts say.
[2:57:48.400 --> 2:57:50.400]  That's what all the historical studies show.
[2:57:50.400 --> 2:57:56.400]  I think Barr encouraged federal prosecutors to pursue what he called substantial allegations of voter fraud,
[2:57:56.400 --> 2:58:00.400]  even though there was no evidence of such in this election.
[2:58:00.400 --> 2:58:03.400]  You know, voter fraud is a lot like Al Capone's vault.
[2:58:03.400 --> 2:58:08.400]  Lots of hype, but not much, you know, actually in there.
[2:58:08.400 --> 2:58:15.400]  And everyone knows Congress is a useless theatrical husk of its former founding father idealistic self.
[2:58:15.400 --> 2:58:22.400]  Those documents detail a $400 million acquisition of the Dominion Software Company by the Communist Chinese
[2:58:22.400 --> 2:58:29.400]  via the Swiss company UBS through a U.S. private equity group known as Staple Street Capital,
[2:58:29.400 --> 2:58:34.400]  which ultimately leads to the nefarious multinational Carlisle Group.
[2:58:34.400 --> 2:58:38.400]  The Carlisle Group personifies Eisenhower's ominous warning.
[2:58:38.400 --> 2:58:45.400]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
[2:58:45.400 --> 2:58:49.400]  whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex.
[2:58:49.400 --> 2:58:55.400]  The Carlisle Group was founded in 1987 at the Carlisle Hotel in New York City
[2:58:55.400 --> 2:58:59.400]  by Bill Conway, Daniel Dianne Yellow, and David Rubenstein.
[2:58:59.400 --> 2:59:04.400]  The Carlisle Group operates out of the District of Corruption in our nation's capital
[2:59:04.400 --> 2:59:11.400]  with 31 offices on six continents occupying a unique reality at the highest levels
[2:59:11.400 --> 2:59:18.400]  in what is known as the Iron Triangle, a world dominated by politics, industry, and the military.
[2:59:18.400 --> 2:59:25.400]  A group of a business built around defense and military that becomes so large and so powerful
[2:59:25.400 --> 2:59:31.400]  that it's actually able to influence the politics of war.
[2:59:31.400 --> 2:59:36.400]  In my direction, elements of the 82nd Airborne Division,
[2:59:36.400 --> 2:59:39.400]  as well as key units of the United States Air Force,
[2:59:39.400 --> 2:59:44.400]  are arriving today to take up defensive positions in Saudi Arabia.
[2:59:44.400 --> 2:59:49.400]  The Carlisle Group pioneered the shadowy world of conflict of interest
[2:59:49.400 --> 2:59:54.400]  disguised as nepotism as a means to broker deals with foreign interests.
[2:59:54.400 --> 2:59:57.400]  I have said that it's the worst kind of conflict of interest,
[2:59:57.400 --> 3:00:01.400]  particularly when your son is the President of the United States.
[3:00:01.400 --> 3:00:06.400]  While Junior is talking to heads of state about war and other weighty matters,
[3:00:06.400 --> 3:00:11.400]  Papa is talking to them or having conversations with them about Carlisle.
[3:00:11.400 --> 3:00:16.400]  It's just, I find it disgusting.
[3:00:16.400 --> 3:00:21.400]  Setting the precedent for the nepotistic activity of the Biden crime family.
[3:00:21.400 --> 3:00:24.400]  Hunter Biden, your son, was getting paid a lot of money
[3:00:24.400 --> 3:00:29.400]  to serve on the board of a Ukrainian energy company facing serious corruption charges.
[3:00:29.400 --> 3:00:32.400]  You were the Vice President running Point on Ukraine.
[3:00:32.400 --> 3:00:36.400]  What's your understanding of what your son was doing for an extraordinary amount of money?
[3:00:36.400 --> 3:00:39.400]  I don't know what he was doing. I know he was on the board.
[3:00:39.400 --> 3:00:43.400]  I found out he was on the board after he was on the board, and that was it.
[3:00:43.400 --> 3:00:48.400]  Of course, it was the Carlisle Group that sat with the Bin Laden family members
[3:00:48.400 --> 3:00:50.400]  as 9-11 was underway.
[3:00:50.400 --> 3:00:58.400]  I talked to someone who was at the meeting, and they told me that the whole crew of Carlisle,
[3:00:58.400 --> 3:01:04.400]  including Frank Carlucci and James Baker and David Rubenstein,
[3:01:04.400 --> 3:01:12.400]  along with Shafiq Bin Laden, who was a representative of the Bin Laden family and their fortunes,
[3:01:12.400 --> 3:01:18.400]  were all in the same room together watching the events of September 11th take place.
[3:01:18.400 --> 3:01:25.400]  It was the Carlisle Group that bought a majority stake in the world's most profitable spy organization,
[3:01:25.400 --> 3:01:30.400]  Booz Allen Hamilton, home of the prison breach by Patriot Edward Snowden.
[3:01:30.400 --> 3:01:35.400]  And it was the Carlisle Group that meddled in the election of Cynthia McKinney,
[3:01:35.400 --> 3:01:37.400]  who had brought their corruption to light.
[3:01:37.400 --> 3:01:43.400]  The Crusader missile was manufactured by United Defense Industries,
[3:01:43.400 --> 3:01:48.400]  and that that company was owned by the Carlisle Group.
[3:01:48.400 --> 3:01:58.400]  So when the time came for us to vote, our committee, to vote on the Defense Authorization Bill,
[3:01:58.400 --> 3:02:00.400]  I voted no.
[3:02:00.400 --> 3:02:05.400]  Then a very strange thing happened in my election.
[3:02:05.400 --> 3:02:07.400]  I'm a Democrat.
[3:02:07.400 --> 3:02:13.400]  What the Republicans did was the Republicans went out and got a black woman who was a Republican
[3:02:13.400 --> 3:02:18.400]  to run as a Democrat in my Democratic primary.
[3:02:18.400 --> 3:02:28.400]  And then 47,000 Republicans crossed over and voted in my Democratic primary.
[3:02:28.400 --> 3:02:34.400]  The Carlisle Group is fast approaching Goliath status as a leading defense contractor,
[3:02:34.400 --> 3:02:39.400]  as well as long having spread their tentacles with billions invested in China.
[3:02:39.400 --> 3:02:45.400]  In 2010, two former managers from the Carlisle Group created Staple Street Capital.
[3:02:45.400 --> 3:02:53.400]  As of July of 2018, the fraud-spewing Dominion voting machines were under total control of Staple Street Capital.
[3:02:53.400 --> 3:02:59.400]  Those managers' names are clearly on the documents of the $400 million transaction
[3:02:59.400 --> 3:03:04.400]  between the Communist Chinese government and UBS Securities, a Swiss investment bank,
[3:03:04.400 --> 3:03:09.400]  which owns just 24.99% of UBS Securities.
[3:03:09.400 --> 3:03:16.400]  The remaining 75% of UBS Securities is owned by the Chinese government, as reported by the National Pulse.
[3:03:16.400 --> 3:03:19.400]  Just how deeply embedded is the Carlisle Group?
[3:03:19.400 --> 3:03:27.400]  Barack Obama rewarded former Carlisle Group managing director William Conard with an ambassadorship to the European Union.
[3:03:27.400 --> 3:03:33.400]  Conard is currently a member of the operating executive board of Staple Street Capital.
[3:03:33.400 --> 3:03:40.400]  The Carlisle Group and their private equity cohorts showered millions on Chinese puppet Joe Biden's basement campaign.
[3:03:40.400 --> 3:03:48.400]  Recently, over 160 New York executives wrote a letter to push the transition of the presidency.
[3:03:48.400 --> 3:03:54.400]  In the letter, they demanded that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as president-elect and vice-president-elect,
[3:03:54.400 --> 3:04:02.400]  which legally they aren't, take power for the national interest and respect for the integrity of our democratic process.
[3:04:02.400 --> 3:04:10.400]  It should be abundantly clear by now that we no longer live in a republic held accountable by a democratic process.
[3:04:10.400 --> 3:04:16.400]  We live in a full-blown corporatocracy, held bent on a hostile takeover of our God-given rights.
[3:04:16.400 --> 3:04:25.400]  John Bown reporting.
[3:04:25.400 --> 3:04:28.400]  Unreal.
[3:04:28.400 --> 3:04:30.400]  Unreal.
[3:04:30.400 --> 3:04:36.400]  You know, thinking about all this, thinking about what we just heard in that going into this segment,
[3:04:36.400 --> 3:04:43.400]  you know, the groups that control so much of what's going on in the world,
[3:04:43.400 --> 3:04:47.400]  there's a alphabet soup of them, actually.
[3:04:47.400 --> 3:04:52.400]  But when you really think about it, at the very top, there's just a handful.
[3:04:52.400 --> 3:04:58.400]  And, you know, this week I had, like every week, I have a lot of pretty interesting conversations.
[3:04:58.400 --> 3:05:05.400]  And I make it a point to reach out to people that I know that are really brilliant and some of them reach back.
[3:05:05.400 --> 3:05:09.400]  Sometimes I never hear from them for long periods of time, but that's okay.
[3:05:09.400 --> 3:05:14.400]  When we do, it's really high-quality conversation, you know, and it goes a little bit of time.
[3:05:14.400 --> 3:05:19.400]  And this week I spoke to people on the West Coast that are in touch with people all over the world.
[3:05:19.400 --> 3:05:28.400]  I talked to people in Moscow, Belgium, Asia, literally around the world.
[3:05:28.400 --> 3:05:36.400]  And in these conversations, everyone is seeing similar things play out, you know, in terms of trusting the mainstream.
[3:05:36.400 --> 3:05:39.400]  If you're getting any information there, you're too late.
[3:05:39.400 --> 3:05:45.400]  I mean, way too late, because it's the propaganda feed after the fact.
[3:05:45.400 --> 3:05:50.400]  And the military-industrial complex that was being alluded to in that last segment.
[3:05:50.400 --> 3:05:53.400]  This is, we're talking about money and power.
[3:05:53.400 --> 3:05:58.400]  We're talking about trillions, the information, communication, transportation industries,
[3:05:58.400 --> 3:06:02.400]  the defense industries, the pharmaceutical industries, the big ones.
[3:06:02.400 --> 3:06:07.400]  The big ones that have billions and billions of consumers and the governments,
[3:06:07.400 --> 3:06:13.400]  with billions and billions of taxpayers and the corporations.
[3:06:13.400 --> 3:06:20.400]  Riding for free through the world in the nonprofits, their voices of goodness.
[3:06:20.400 --> 3:06:24.400]  Riding for free on the backs of every human being on the planet.
[3:06:24.400 --> 3:06:29.400]  This is Dr. Nick Begich. We're going to be right back, right after these.
[3:06:29.400 --> 3:06:32.400]  Really, really important messages to keep this network going.
[3:06:32.400 --> 3:07:01.400]  Pay attention, we'll be right back.
[3:07:02.400 --> 3:07:06.400]  Now, how to fly thousands and thousands of miles back to the exact place where they were born.
[3:07:06.400 --> 3:07:10.400]  They're following magnetic lines. They have magnetic cells in their brains.
[3:07:10.400 --> 3:07:13.400]  We now know side-difference is going on. There's even a lot more than that.
[3:07:13.400 --> 3:07:17.400]  So, when we talk about the spirit, we're talking about all the dark matter.
[3:07:17.400 --> 3:07:19.400]  We're talking about all the things you don't understand, but we know it's there.
[3:07:19.400 --> 3:07:23.400]  And just like you can have a bunch of robots working off the wireless system,
[3:07:23.400 --> 3:07:28.400]  that's what's going on with this satanic transmission that's working through people.
[3:07:28.400 --> 3:07:32.400]  And that's how this entity behind it all is able to direct it,
[3:07:32.400 --> 3:07:36.400]  because it is a consciousness manipulated in the space time continuum.
[3:07:36.400 --> 3:07:43.400]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made, Alpha Power.

[3:08:58.400 --> 3:09:08.400]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Nick Baggage.
[3:09:08.400 --> 3:09:10.400]  And welcome back and thanks for being here.
[3:09:10.400 --> 3:09:14.400]  I always forget to mention my own website at earthpulse.com.
[3:09:14.400 --> 3:09:18.400]  E-A-R-T-H-P-U-L-S-E earthpulse.com.
[3:09:18.400 --> 3:09:20.400]  Check it out.
[3:09:20.400 --> 3:09:26.400]  When you look at books or videos there, it clicks you straight into the InfowarsStore
[3:09:26.400 --> 3:09:28.400]  and that's where all of that stuff is.
[3:09:28.400 --> 3:09:32.400]  So it's just a link, but you can get right into my information, some of the things I have there.
[3:09:32.400 --> 3:09:39.400]  Also, you can look at sort of the back shows of what we've done here on the Infowars.
[3:09:39.400 --> 3:09:45.400]  And Infowars has been in this a very long time, now over a quarter of a century.
[3:09:45.400 --> 3:09:50.400]  And when I think about what's happened together, what we've all been able to do together,
[3:09:50.400 --> 3:09:55.400]  we're at five minutes to midnight, but we always knew it was coming.
[3:09:55.400 --> 3:10:02.400]  So here we are doing our thing individually and as a kind of loosely knit sort of organization,
[3:10:02.400 --> 3:10:05.400]  which is the best kind, it's called the human race.
[3:10:05.400 --> 3:10:10.400]  And we're in it whether we like it or not.
[3:10:10.400 --> 3:10:16.400]  And I laugh about it a lot because I look at all the divisiveness that's being thrown around,
[3:10:16.400 --> 3:10:18.400]  mainly by the mainstream media.
[3:10:18.400 --> 3:10:25.400]  They keep hyping it all up to a point where it's like, what are we talking about here?
[3:10:25.400 --> 3:10:33.400]  And my granddaughter, she's a biracial, she's half black and half white,
[3:10:33.400 --> 3:10:37.400]  and I've been raising her with my former spouse since she was one.
[3:10:37.400 --> 3:10:42.400]  And let me tell you something about my conversations with her this week,
[3:10:42.400 --> 3:10:48.400]  because she's getting all this mainstream and all the people she associates with as a child,
[3:10:48.400 --> 3:10:52.400]  you know, because you mix with all kinds of folks and hear all kinds of things.
[3:10:52.400 --> 3:10:58.400]  And there's a lot of confusion in the world, you know, where the world is colorblind.
[3:10:58.400 --> 3:11:00.400]  For me, I am, I always have been.
[3:11:00.400 --> 3:11:06.400]  And that was my conversation with her is, hey, wait a minute, why should we be emphasizing these things
[3:11:06.400 --> 3:11:14.400]  when we should be emphasizing the humanness of each of us, the humanity of each of us?
[3:11:14.400 --> 3:11:18.400]  What does that mean? You know, and I talk about it a lot on this show.
[3:11:18.400 --> 3:11:24.400]  What does that mean? You know, it's again, what are we doing here on this planet?
[3:11:24.400 --> 3:11:28.400]  What are we supposed to be doing? Alex is doing his bit, I do my bit.
[3:11:28.400 --> 3:11:32.400]  Everyone in the production team is doing their bit and everyone of you is doing your bit.
[3:11:32.400 --> 3:11:42.400]  Hey, that's the magic formula. If there's such a thing, trying faith based on what we're trying to do individually,
[3:11:42.400 --> 3:11:46.400]  that's what it's called when you actually stand up and do something is because you believe in it,
[3:11:46.400 --> 3:11:52.400]  because you have faith in it. It's really that simple. It's not a complicated message. It never is.
[3:11:52.400 --> 3:11:58.400]  Those that make it a complicated message want you not to ever find the power in it.
[3:11:58.400 --> 3:12:06.400]  The power in the creation is really simplicity in a lot of ways and then complexity that gets stacked up on it.
[3:12:06.400 --> 3:12:13.400]  And today, going into the show, I always kind of have one idea and then it sort of morphs into another.
[3:12:13.400 --> 3:12:19.400]  And here we are again. And I was talking just for the break about all these conversations I've had
[3:12:19.400 --> 3:12:25.400]  and all these perspectives that I gained this week. And then I distill down against all the data that I go and get and do
[3:12:25.400 --> 3:12:31.400]  and all the other things I'm doing. And at the same time, I deal with all the kind of things you deal with.
[3:12:31.400 --> 3:12:40.400]  You know, I've got a big extended family that always there's something going on that's pretty big and dramatic.
[3:12:40.400 --> 3:12:45.400]  I can assure you. And I got to deal with that just like you deal with all that stuff every day.
[3:12:45.400 --> 3:12:52.400]  But we still do our thing, right? We still get through the noise of life and find our way through it
[3:12:52.400 --> 3:12:57.400]  and do the things that we can be highly productive in. And that's that is our calling, you see.
[3:12:57.400 --> 3:13:01.400]  And I want to talk about a little bit of that in the context of today's show.
[3:13:01.400 --> 3:13:08.400]  Because this marks I didn't even think about to always make my notes a few moments before the show is in 1980,
[3:13:08.400 --> 3:13:17.400]  40 years ago, which in some people, syntax is a generation, 40 years. And I would say so.
[3:13:17.400 --> 3:13:22.400]  And in that 40 years, and I think I've mentioned before, I've been doing my next 20 year plan,
[3:13:22.400 --> 3:13:26.400]  you know, kind of looking forward where am I going, where have I been.
[3:13:26.400 --> 3:13:39.400]  And in 1980, I was 21. And I was, and I hitchhiked out of Alaska to Dallas and started over again for three years.
[3:13:39.400 --> 3:13:44.400]  I was there was kind of my really my training, my education.
[3:13:44.400 --> 3:13:52.400]  And if I ever had any teachers in my life that I would say were teachers, it was the one guy I knew there,
[3:13:52.400 --> 3:13:57.400]  who was the pastor of the group I was involved in. And it was an assembly of God.
[3:13:57.400 --> 3:14:04.400]  And I know some of you aren't Christians, some of you are. And I respect all of all of you.
[3:14:04.400 --> 3:14:09.400]  And I hope you can respect me too, and whether we're different or alike in our beliefs.
[3:14:09.400 --> 3:14:15.400]  And what I did there for three years is I prayed every day for wisdom,
[3:14:15.400 --> 3:14:20.400]  because of the things I'd been through that caused me to have to hitchhike to Dallas and start over.
[3:14:20.400 --> 3:14:24.400]  Okay, so I wanted wisdom in my life at that, at that stage.
[3:14:24.400 --> 3:14:33.400]  And what I didn't really realize, I wasn't very wise, is when you ask for wisdom, the price of it's really high.
[3:14:33.400 --> 3:14:41.400]  And you're going to get a ration of it for a very long time, more than likely, and to get just a little bit of wisdom.
[3:14:41.400 --> 3:14:47.400]  I think I have a little bit now, took a very long time, you know, I'm 62 now, just turned 62.
[3:14:47.400 --> 3:14:55.400]  And I think about this 40 year generation that I went through and where I'm going and where all of us are going together in this generation.
[3:14:55.400 --> 3:14:58.400]  The one we're living in, the one we're doing together.
[3:14:58.400 --> 3:15:05.400]  And we have the opportunity to shape it, or be the recipients of it, depending on what we individually do,
[3:15:05.400 --> 3:15:07.400]  and how that all kind of moves together.
[3:15:07.400 --> 3:15:13.400]  And I heard earlier, Alex was saying, you know, something if we don't even see this stuff, you know, we go, why?
[3:15:13.400 --> 3:15:15.400]  Why is this happening, God?
[3:15:15.400 --> 3:15:21.400]  You know, how did this mess happen with Biden and the Harris, and what is going to be the result of that?
[3:15:21.400 --> 3:15:30.400]  And again, I would say, don't worry, just make sure you're doing your bit, because it's all under control, I can assure you.
[3:15:30.400 --> 3:15:33.400]  The universe has it figured out.
[3:15:33.400 --> 3:15:43.400]  And we get to play in the drama of this living experience as creators, co-creators, creating the image and lightness of God,
[3:15:43.400 --> 3:15:50.400]  or as just people grabbed around by the emotional litter and drug through life, you know, that's our choice.
[3:15:50.400 --> 3:15:55.400]  That's the first choice we get to make is, hey, are we going to be drug around by all of this?
[3:15:55.400 --> 3:16:02.400]  Or are we going to come back into ourselves, recognize what we are, begin to project a bit differently?
[3:16:02.400 --> 3:16:04.400]  So I want to talk about this experience.
[3:16:04.400 --> 3:16:06.400]  I hitchhiked down to Dallas.
[3:16:06.400 --> 3:16:08.400]  So I get to Dallas.
[3:16:08.400 --> 3:16:14.400]  An uncle of my wife at the time and aunt have us together there, and we're making it.
[3:16:14.400 --> 3:16:20.400]  And I have two small children under one's five and one's three.
[3:16:20.400 --> 3:16:27.400]  And, you know, this is a tough scene, you know, but I worked my way out of it over three years.
[3:16:27.400 --> 3:16:36.400]  I lived below the poverty level during those three years, and I got my own place within a few months and did all that and struggled like everybody else struggles.
[3:16:36.400 --> 3:16:39.400]  And then I returned to Alaska.
[3:16:39.400 --> 3:16:51.400]  And I want to mention again, you know, that journey when I returned to Alaska, you know, I came back and immediately fell into good employment,
[3:16:51.400 --> 3:17:00.400]  did all the things I needed to do because of family background and knowing people here and people knowing me and having the opportunity to do some things.
[3:17:00.400 --> 3:17:08.400]  So I started over here as well and have been inordinately successful in my life, I would say, by the grace of God.
[3:17:08.400 --> 3:17:14.400]  But in all of this, what I'm trying to say is everyone's life has a measure of suffering in it.
[3:17:14.400 --> 3:17:18.400]  And in the suffering and in the traumas where a greater throat possibilities are.
[3:17:18.400 --> 3:17:24.400]  And that's really the theme of the show because this country, this world is suffering now and we are in the transformation.
[3:17:24.400 --> 3:17:29.400]  We are in the revolution within ourselves, within the planet, within our nation, within our communities.
[3:17:29.400 --> 3:17:33.400]  And we are the Imple Wars and you are the tip of the speed.
[3:17:33.400 --> 3:17:35.400]  So let's do it together.
[3:17:35.400 --> 3:17:39.400]  The globalists and their minions want to play God.
[3:17:39.400 --> 3:17:42.400]  Chucky Schumer, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama.
[3:17:42.400 --> 3:17:47.400]  You look at these sacks of garbage and you think, why do they hate humanity so much?
[3:17:47.400 --> 3:17:48.400]  Why do they love death?
[3:17:48.400 --> 3:17:51.400]  Because they hate themselves.
[3:17:51.400 --> 3:17:57.400]  They project their own disgust with their soul onto us.
[3:17:57.400 --> 3:18:02.400]  And once you understand that basic psychological point, every other answer is completely clear.
[3:18:02.400 --> 3:18:06.400]  That's why they hate Imple Wars. We believe in humanity. We think you're beautiful.
[3:18:06.400 --> 3:18:08.400]  We think you're amazing.
[3:18:08.400 --> 3:18:13.400]  Imple Wars knows you're fallen, but that you have God's potential that God gave you.
[3:18:13.400 --> 3:18:17.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, the great epic battle is now here. It's now upon us.
[3:18:17.400 --> 3:18:20.400]  I want to encourage you all to spread the word about Imple Wars now more than ever.
[3:18:20.400 --> 3:18:23.400]  And the enemy hopes to shut down the light of truth.
[3:18:23.400 --> 3:18:26.400]  We know you're going to override these globalists. We know you're going to defeat them.
[3:18:26.400 --> 3:18:29.400]  I just want to salute you all for your action, everything you've already done.
[3:18:29.400 --> 3:18:33.400]  Because God's on our side and the globalists know it.
[3:18:35.400 --> 3:18:46.400]  Back in 1996, the head of the World Food Program said that they would use food and global lockdowns due to a virus scare to bring in world government.
[3:18:46.400 --> 3:18:53.400]  That also came out in the North American Union documents that Judicial Watch and Lou Dobbs got more than 15 years ago as well.
[3:18:53.400 --> 3:18:58.400]  So we know their plan. And if they're able to keep this lockdown going, it's going to cause not just a worldwide depression.
[3:18:58.400 --> 3:19:03.400]  But mass starvation of hundreds of millions, millions have already starved to death.
[3:19:03.400 --> 3:19:05.400]  Not from COVID, but from the lockdown.
[3:19:05.400 --> 3:19:09.400]  That's why it's important for people in North America to get prepared for hell all over the world.
[3:19:09.400 --> 3:19:16.400]  But we have high-quality horrible food, ready to ship to you the last 25 years, and prepare with Alex.com.
[3:19:16.400 --> 3:19:20.400]  There's an additional 10% off of a very rare sale that's going right now.
[3:19:20.400 --> 3:19:22.400]  Prepare with Alex.com.
[3:19:22.400 --> 3:19:26.400]  Also at ImpleWars.com, we have all the great supplements that boost your immune system.
[3:19:26.400 --> 3:19:29.400]  And so much more with free shipping as well, up to 60% off.
[3:19:29.400 --> 3:19:34.400]  So take advantage of that at ImpleWars.com and prepare with Alex.com. God bless.
[3:19:34.400 --> 3:19:38.400]  You know, something very sad is happening. It's very sad because it was all avoidable.
[3:19:38.400 --> 3:19:43.400]  Two and a half years ago, when ImpleWars got banned off of more than 60 major platforms,
[3:19:43.400 --> 3:19:47.400]  I warned everybody that it was a precedent for the upcoming presidential election
[3:19:47.400 --> 3:19:52.400]  and that they would continue to ratchet down and tighten down the censorship
[3:19:52.400 --> 3:19:59.400]  until, effectively, there was a total internet kill switch in place against conservatives, nationals, and populists.
[3:19:59.400 --> 3:20:00.400]  And now that's happened.
[3:20:00.400 --> 3:20:04.400]  And then I told everybody that they would then start moving to arrest individuals
[3:20:04.400 --> 3:20:08.400]  that demonstrate in protest using a second COVID-19 lockdown
[3:20:08.400 --> 3:20:14.400]  and that Trump needed to get out front and fully repudiate COVID-19 as basically an overblown hoax.
[3:20:14.400 --> 3:20:17.400]  He started to do that in the last few months of the campaign,
[3:20:17.400 --> 3:20:21.400]  but we have to understand that that's the pincer attack they're going to use.
[3:20:21.400 --> 3:20:26.400]  They're going to use Black Lives Matter and race war to start up the American people and divide us,
[3:20:26.400 --> 3:20:30.400]  and they're going to use economic warfare, shutting down the economy to try to control us.
[3:20:30.400 --> 3:20:55.400]  I hope people will listen now to my warnings because I'm on air telling people what's coming next.
[3:21:00.400 --> 3:21:05.400]  Nick Baggett.
[3:21:05.400 --> 3:21:06.400]  And welcome back.
[3:21:06.400 --> 3:21:11.400]  It's good to be here this Friday, just before noon in my part of the World Anchorage, Alaska,
[3:21:11.400 --> 3:21:15.400]  and a little afternoon in most of the places where we're being heard.
[3:21:15.400 --> 3:21:20.400]  You know, there's a lot of other people involved in supporting this network,
[3:21:20.400 --> 3:21:24.400]  including all the independent stations that run this program,
[3:21:24.400 --> 3:21:28.400]  and everyone appreciates that because it's another way to get the word out.
[3:21:28.400 --> 3:21:33.400]  But whatever you do, pass these on to link them up to your friends and colleagues.
[3:21:33.400 --> 3:21:38.400]  That's how this message spreads because it's one person at a time meeting people where they are.
[3:21:38.400 --> 3:21:44.400]  And you know, I go back to Dallas again and the teaching I received from Eric Eulett,
[3:21:44.400 --> 3:21:47.400]  who was a pastor there.
[3:21:47.400 --> 3:21:52.400]  And you know, when I think about all that, you know, the calling, you know, God's calling,
[3:21:52.400 --> 3:21:54.400]  you know, hello, answer the phone.
[3:21:54.400 --> 3:21:57.400]  But a lot of times we never even know it, you know.
[3:21:57.400 --> 3:22:00.400]  We just get, and this is, again, what I'm talking about.
[3:22:00.400 --> 3:22:04.400]  A lot of times, most of us get just sort of swept along in the wave
[3:22:04.400 --> 3:22:09.400]  and we sort of go along with the program and we're easily manipulated when we're doing that.
[3:22:09.400 --> 3:22:14.400]  We just sort of fall into our flesh and sort of go, yeah, and let the emotion drag us around.
[3:22:14.400 --> 3:22:19.400]  And that was where I was headed today in this conversation.
[3:22:19.400 --> 3:22:22.400]  And here's what I want to say about that.
[3:22:22.400 --> 3:22:30.400]  Think about it both from a science perspective as well as a sort of a little esoteric,
[3:22:30.400 --> 3:22:40.400]  a little mystical perhaps perspective, but I would call a deep perspective, a different perspective.
[3:22:40.400 --> 3:22:45.400]  So think about the body and you think about the flesh, right?
[3:22:45.400 --> 3:22:49.400]  And you can also think about it as the temple, right?
[3:22:49.400 --> 3:22:54.400]  I mean, think about this for a moment because I want to deal with this piece of it first.
[3:22:54.400 --> 3:23:02.400]  Okay, the body, the flesh and what that means, and then this last thing, the temple.
[3:23:02.400 --> 3:23:04.400]  All right, now that's interesting.
[3:23:04.400 --> 3:23:07.400]  And again, I want to go back to this theme I touch on every once in a while,
[3:23:07.400 --> 3:23:09.400]  creating the image and likeness of God.
[3:23:09.400 --> 3:23:11.400]  Okay, now this is a temple, what does that mean?
[3:23:11.400 --> 3:23:15.400]  Well, the mathematics of it, there is mathematics in it.
[3:23:15.400 --> 3:23:23.400]  There's sacred geometry in it because life is created by formula, by design, right?
[3:23:23.400 --> 3:23:26.400]  A grand design, you know?
[3:23:26.400 --> 3:23:29.400]  And so there's some order in it, right?
[3:23:29.400 --> 3:23:30.400]  I mean, there's structure in it.
[3:23:30.400 --> 3:23:32.400]  A lot of times we don't ever see it.
[3:23:32.400 --> 3:23:35.400]  We don't know it because we're just not there, you know?
[3:23:35.400 --> 3:23:42.400]  Okay, but as our minds expand and our information as we think about it expands,
[3:23:42.400 --> 3:23:45.400]  the world's knowledge expands, we think we get a better focus on it.
[3:23:45.400 --> 3:23:48.400]  We do, we increase the resolution, I always use that word.
[3:23:48.400 --> 3:23:52.400]  You know, it gets better and better, the more we know, the more we can see.
[3:23:52.400 --> 3:23:57.400]  You know, that's kind of some bricks in the wall of wisdom, but not wisdom.
[3:23:57.400 --> 3:23:59.400]  Don't confuse it, don't confuse it with knowledge.
[3:23:59.400 --> 3:24:04.400]  This is called a bricks in the walls of wisdom, and those bricks are just bits of information.
[3:24:04.400 --> 3:24:07.400]  They don't mean anything on their own.
[3:24:07.400 --> 3:24:11.400]  They're just bits of information, they're the facts, the bricks.
[3:24:11.400 --> 3:24:14.400]  And then there's knowledge, which is how you link the bricks up.
[3:24:14.400 --> 3:24:17.400]  That comes from God, that comes from your connection to creation.
[3:24:17.400 --> 3:24:22.400]  That allows you to sort all that in the medium called the mind or the brain.
[3:24:22.400 --> 3:24:26.400]  The brain being the physical part, mind being the part we don't really get, you know?
[3:24:26.400 --> 3:24:31.400]  And the consciousness being that behind all of it that we're linked to.
[3:24:31.400 --> 3:24:35.400]  Okay, and then there's the one, the one we think about us, the one.
[3:24:35.400 --> 3:24:38.400]  You see that Carlisle group, they think about that a lot.
[3:24:38.400 --> 3:24:43.400]  They think about flesh, they think about that, and they let the flesh and their intellect and their emotion,
[3:24:43.400 --> 3:24:46.400]  although they think they have very high intellect and emotion, they do.
[3:24:46.400 --> 3:24:52.400]  And they've learned how to mix this in the creative way and how to corrupt that creation.
[3:24:52.400 --> 3:24:59.400]  So they never really plug into the high voltage plug of God,
[3:24:59.400 --> 3:25:03.400]  but they get a cheap substitute that feels pretty good.
[3:25:03.400 --> 3:25:10.400]  You know, you could call it the orgasmic substitute of nonsense, because that's all it is.
[3:25:10.400 --> 3:25:14.400]  And they use sexual energy, so I don't use that just metaphorically, I use that realistically.
[3:25:14.400 --> 3:25:19.400]  What are the conversations I was in this week with a very, very credible God?
[3:25:19.400 --> 3:25:22.400]  Now, a lot of conversations I have with my friends, I travel.
[3:25:22.400 --> 3:25:25.400]  See, I travel a lot. I show up.
[3:25:25.400 --> 3:25:29.400]  And then we have conversations, you know, taking a walk in the woods with no electronics
[3:25:29.400 --> 3:25:32.400]  so we can actually have one that's our own.
[3:25:32.400 --> 3:25:36.400]  So there's abbreviated conversations of the world right now,
[3:25:36.400 --> 3:25:40.400]  because you're kind of hung up on the travel arrangements.
[3:25:40.400 --> 3:25:48.400]  But what he said was, a couple people don't want to identify too much, but I would say this,
[3:25:48.400 --> 3:25:53.400]  a couple of horrors, real horrors for the CIA,
[3:25:53.400 --> 3:26:03.400]  incredibly, doing the work of the CIA, which is, you know, the sexual extortion piece that Epstein also did with his crew,
[3:26:03.400 --> 3:26:10.400]  because it's about blackmail and extortion and all of this really dark, ugly stuff.
[3:26:10.400 --> 3:26:15.400]  And see, in this Democratic Republic where government is in our name and in our stead,
[3:26:15.400 --> 3:26:20.400]  holds the power of attorney, if you will, for us, for our value system,
[3:26:20.400 --> 3:26:23.400]  they're out there doing this dance.
[3:26:23.400 --> 3:26:29.400]  Okay? They're out there in our names doing these things.
[3:26:29.400 --> 3:26:32.400]  And we've read about them, including kidnapping and torture.
[3:26:32.400 --> 3:26:35.400]  We've all read about that even in the New York Times.
[3:26:35.400 --> 3:26:42.400]  A lot of things have been done in the name of you and me and our children and our grandchildren,
[3:26:42.400 --> 3:26:45.400]  our great-grandchildren, the generations to come.
[3:26:45.400 --> 3:26:49.400]  There's been no accountability for it at all. We've allowed it.
[3:26:49.400 --> 3:26:55.400]  In fact, the military-industrial conflict has created this illusion.
[3:26:55.400 --> 3:26:58.400]  So what are we in this equation?
[3:26:58.400 --> 3:27:06.400]  Are we just a bag of chemicals with a framework called a skeletal structure to hold it all together,
[3:27:06.400 --> 3:27:14.400]  layered up with a muscle system and a set of organs and a nervous system and a circulatory system?
[3:27:14.400 --> 3:27:22.400]  And then we are going to die in a 40, 80, 100 years, whatever it is, the clock will run out.
[3:27:22.400 --> 3:27:23.400]  That's it.
[3:27:23.400 --> 3:27:29.400]  Well, if you believe that, then you live in fear all the time because the body knows its clock will run out.
[3:27:29.400 --> 3:27:32.400]  And at some level, the mind knows this too.
[3:27:32.400 --> 3:27:39.400]  Consciousness knows better, but if you've turned it off too long, you don't hear it anyway, so you do get lost before.
[3:27:39.400 --> 3:27:43.400]  So the route out is to look again.
[3:27:43.400 --> 3:27:49.400]  That's why I don't want to be critical of anyone's path, no matter what you do, no matter how you do it.
[3:27:49.400 --> 3:27:51.400]  I just want you to do it.
[3:27:51.400 --> 3:27:52.400]  Just search.
[3:27:52.400 --> 3:27:53.400]  Find answers.
[3:27:53.400 --> 3:27:59.400]  Look for your answers in the sciences, in religion, in whatever you think you need to look,
[3:27:59.400 --> 3:28:03.400]  because if it's sincere and you really are asking the big questions in life,
[3:28:03.400 --> 3:28:08.400]  they'll find the answers in some form or way, but it may be traumatic.
[3:28:08.400 --> 3:28:13.400]  So ask for grace for goodness sake, even if you're not a believer, you better ask for it,
[3:28:13.400 --> 3:28:15.400]  because boy, it makes the journey a little easier.
[3:28:15.400 --> 3:28:21.400]  The other part of this I want to talk about, the energetic side.
[3:28:21.400 --> 3:28:24.400]  Now, I'm talking about this bag of chemicals and all this stuff.
[3:28:24.400 --> 3:28:26.400]  It reacts to things.
[3:28:26.400 --> 3:28:28.400]  It's where the emotions grab you.
[3:28:28.400 --> 3:28:32.400]  It's where the emotions and thoughts come together and they grab you and start jerking you around.
[3:28:32.400 --> 3:28:39.400]  And people who know how to manipulate that by generating fear and anger and hostilities
[3:28:39.400 --> 3:28:46.400]  in the way that the mainstream has been doing that to divide us, to separate us, to take away from us,
[3:28:46.400 --> 3:28:55.400]  to the point of even putting us all under house arrest under the COVID-19 veil of truth.
[3:28:55.400 --> 3:29:00.400]  Veil, I say real loudly, of truth, because it hides behind the truth.
[3:29:00.400 --> 3:29:04.400]  It keeps you from having the truth, keeps you from experiencing humanity that you are,
[3:29:04.400 --> 3:29:09.400]  that you were created to be, interacting with people, human beings like we're supposed to.
[3:29:09.400 --> 3:29:13.400]  One-on-one, one person at a time, right?
[3:29:13.400 --> 3:29:15.400]  That's how it goes.
[3:29:15.400 --> 3:29:20.400]  So when I think about this, I think about, and I'm looking at some of my notes,
[3:29:20.400 --> 3:29:24.400]  awareness was one of my notes, awareness, what is that?
[3:29:24.400 --> 3:29:26.400]  And how does it relate to the temple?
[3:29:26.400 --> 3:29:31.400]  And I was talking about the temple, and you know, Da Vinci has an image with it,
[3:29:31.400 --> 3:29:38.400]  your hand stretched out and it shows this ratio of our living physical form,
[3:29:38.400 --> 3:29:42.400]  and that ratio can be compared to a lot of other living organisms,
[3:29:42.400 --> 3:29:50.400]  from seashells, the spirals in them, to the sacred geometry of Solomon's temple,
[3:29:50.400 --> 3:29:53.400]  which is an archetype for the human body, if you look at that.
[3:29:53.400 --> 3:29:55.400]  And people have.
[3:29:55.400 --> 3:29:59.400]  When you think of the Old Testament, and there's the image on the screen,
[3:29:59.400 --> 3:30:05.400]  these ratios about creation, these things that we are, are just reminders.
[3:30:05.400 --> 3:30:08.400]  And last week I was talking about the brain,
[3:30:08.400 --> 3:30:14.400]  and the brain is an absolute two-scale image of the entire universe according to the latest signs,
[3:30:14.400 --> 3:30:18.400]  meaning we are the hologram, we are a reflection of that creation,
[3:30:18.400 --> 3:30:23.400]  and even the minutest ways of giving us those hints so we can see that reality
[3:30:23.400 --> 3:30:28.400]  and embrace it because in embracing the truth, faith kicks in and then action happens.
[3:30:28.400 --> 3:30:55.400]  This is Nick Faggich, we'll be right back.
[3:30:58.400 --> 3:31:24.400]  We'll be right back.
[3:31:24.400 --> 3:31:53.400]  We'll be right back.
[3:31:54.400 --> 3:32:16.400]  We'll be right back.
[3:32:16.400 --> 3:32:32.400]  We'll be right back.
[3:32:46.400 --> 3:33:12.400]  We'll be right back.
[3:33:12.400 --> 3:33:35.400]  We'll be right back.
[3:33:42.400 --> 3:34:08.400]  We'll be right back.
[3:34:08.400 --> 3:34:35.400]  We'll be right back.
[3:34:38.400 --> 3:35:07.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:35:07.400 --> 3:35:09.400]  And welcome back.
[3:35:09.400 --> 3:35:13.400]  You know, time just flies every Friday afternoon,
[3:35:13.400 --> 3:35:17.400]  but I appreciate you sharing this time with me today.
[3:35:17.400 --> 3:35:22.400]  And again, thinking about the conversations of the week and sort of where the week is
[3:35:22.400 --> 3:35:29.400]  and what all has happened, the election still unsettled in most of our minds at least,
[3:35:29.400 --> 3:35:32.400]  I think the majority of the country.
[3:35:32.400 --> 3:35:37.400]  You know, all the propaganda, all the pushing around again,
[3:35:37.400 --> 3:35:44.400]  it's meant deliberately to knock us off our balance so we're not effective anymore.
[3:35:44.400 --> 3:35:48.400]  And they do it in all different ways, you know, they do it with litigation
[3:35:48.400 --> 3:35:51.400]  as Alex was talking about in some of the last segments, you know,
[3:35:51.400 --> 3:35:53.400]  it ends up costing you millions of dollars.
[3:35:53.400 --> 3:35:58.400]  It's not the dollars, it's the distraction, you know, and that's part of the mission.
[3:35:58.400 --> 3:36:02.400]  You know, they got all the money in the world literally to throw at things, you know,
[3:36:02.400 --> 3:36:04.400]  and then you're distracted.
[3:36:04.400 --> 3:36:06.400]  And so we got to stay on the focus.
[3:36:06.400 --> 3:36:10.400]  And that's where we all got to hang in there together on this one and stay focused.
[3:36:10.400 --> 3:36:12.400]  So support the info wars.
[3:36:12.400 --> 3:36:18.400]  Go to the info wars store.com and do the things that are that are good for you
[3:36:18.400 --> 3:36:20.400]  and good for the network as well.
[3:36:20.400 --> 3:36:25.400]  You know, talking about creation and I talk a lot about it.
[3:36:25.400 --> 3:36:31.400]  I talk about how I see awareness or consciousness or God, whichever label you want to try
[3:36:31.400 --> 3:36:37.400]  and stick on this concept of God, because words are pretty limiting
[3:36:37.400 --> 3:36:39.400]  if you really get right down to it, how would you do that?
[3:36:39.400 --> 3:36:44.400]  And then I say often, you know, kind of think about and we're highly critical of ourselves
[3:36:44.400 --> 3:36:50.400]  and we are and I think that's part of our meter that God builds in, you know,
[3:36:50.400 --> 3:36:54.400]  it's like, okay, are you doing it the best you can and all of us will say no
[3:36:54.400 --> 3:36:57.400]  unless you're lying or you're a saint.
[3:36:57.400 --> 3:36:59.400]  And I haven't met very many saints.
[3:36:59.400 --> 3:37:01.400]  I don't think I've met any actually.
[3:37:01.400 --> 3:37:07.400]  But what I do know is as we mature age, whatever in this reality,
[3:37:07.400 --> 3:37:10.400]  we come into our remembrance for a certain extent.
[3:37:10.400 --> 3:37:14.400]  If life has given up some opportunity, usually they're in the form of trauma.
[3:37:14.400 --> 3:37:17.400]  You know, people know my history, they know about that.
[3:37:17.400 --> 3:37:22.400]  And on a lot of levels, but here's what I know about that.
[3:37:22.400 --> 3:37:24.400]  I wouldn't trade any of it.
[3:37:24.400 --> 3:37:27.400]  Not one breath I've ever taken for another.
[3:37:27.400 --> 3:37:28.400]  No way.
[3:37:28.400 --> 3:37:30.400]  Yeah, I can see all my past brainwrecks.
[3:37:30.400 --> 3:37:37.400]  I know all about them, but they made me who I am today, those experiences.
[3:37:37.400 --> 3:37:39.400]  I don't believe they were accidental either.
[3:37:39.400 --> 3:37:42.400]  I made choices and then I had opportunities to learn.
[3:37:42.400 --> 3:37:44.400]  I either did or I didn't.
[3:37:44.400 --> 3:37:45.400]  I still do.
[3:37:45.400 --> 3:37:46.400]  It happens every day.
[3:37:46.400 --> 3:37:51.400]  It's happening right now, even in this moment, because that's what we get to do together.
[3:37:51.400 --> 3:37:58.400]  And I thought about this, people's relationship to awareness, consciousness, God.
[3:37:58.400 --> 3:38:08.400]  A lot of people have this relationship where they have this sort of a vision of themselves.
[3:38:08.400 --> 3:38:11.400]  And this I don't believe is God's vision, but they have a vision of themselves
[3:38:11.400 --> 3:38:16.400]  that they're just some dirt bag at the chemical bag of bones at the feet of God.
[3:38:16.400 --> 3:38:20.400]  And yeah, on one level, that's true, but that's not who we are.
[3:38:20.400 --> 3:38:25.400]  And that's definitely not what we were created to be, but we can accept that reality if we want to
[3:38:25.400 --> 3:38:26.400]  and live that way.
[3:38:26.400 --> 3:38:31.400]  And a lot of people would like it to, but I don't believe that's correct.
[3:38:31.400 --> 3:38:37.400]  And this vision of God needing all of us to be sitting there, you know, bowing down and worshiping,
[3:38:37.400 --> 3:38:44.400]  although the idea is there, I understand, the respect, the deep depth of appreciation,
[3:38:44.400 --> 3:38:49.400]  gratitude, all those things that encompass that word, worship.
[3:38:49.400 --> 3:38:51.400]  Hey, I understand that.
[3:38:51.400 --> 3:38:53.400]  In a deep sense, I get that.
[3:38:53.400 --> 3:39:08.400]  But I think the reason I see a little differently is I think the creation, awareness, God wants us to be its friend.
[3:39:08.400 --> 3:39:10.400]  How about that one?
[3:39:10.400 --> 3:39:11.400]  A friend of God?
[3:39:11.400 --> 3:39:13.400]  Can you be that?
[3:39:13.400 --> 3:39:14.400]  Whoa.
[3:39:14.400 --> 3:39:17.400]  Now, that's a deep relationship, isn't it?
[3:39:17.400 --> 3:39:19.400]  Friendship.
[3:39:19.400 --> 3:39:26.400]  One of my friends, who's a little out there, you know, in a lot of ways, but one little pearl of wisdom, he says,
[3:39:26.400 --> 3:39:30.400]  and I can embrace that the highest form of love is friendship.
[3:39:30.400 --> 3:39:32.400]  Think about it.
[3:39:32.400 --> 3:39:38.400]  The highest form of love is friendship in one sense, in the world.
[3:39:38.400 --> 3:39:41.400]  Because I think the highest form of love is actually God.
[3:39:41.400 --> 3:39:44.400]  God expresses himself in that word.
[3:39:44.400 --> 3:39:51.400]  You know, so I mean, in a lot of other ways too, but that's a pretty good gateway through it.
[3:39:51.400 --> 3:40:00.400]  And so when you think of that friendship based on that, then you're helping.
[3:40:00.400 --> 3:40:01.400]  You want to help.
[3:40:01.400 --> 3:40:03.400]  You want to help your friend.
[3:40:03.400 --> 3:40:05.400]  Your friend wants to help you.
[3:40:05.400 --> 3:40:09.400]  And I think this is the preferred, not the, at a certain point, life is apparent.
[3:40:09.400 --> 3:40:13.400]  You're getting it beat into you a little bit by life's traumas.
[3:40:13.400 --> 3:40:17.400]  And you blame God, but it's not a blame to be given.
[3:40:17.400 --> 3:40:24.400]  It's a recognition to be accepted because whatever the life experience, however, it disciplines us.
[3:40:24.400 --> 3:40:29.400]  You know, whether it was me hitchhiking to Dallas from Alaska, and I can tell you that was a journey.
[3:40:29.400 --> 3:40:32.400]  Someday I might talk about it more than I did today.
[3:40:32.400 --> 3:40:41.400]  But all of this stuff that we engage in that we think is so wonderful on the one hand and great, wonderful.
[3:40:41.400 --> 3:40:43.400]  And then on the other hand, so horrible and terrible.
[3:40:43.400 --> 3:40:49.400]  And oh my goodness, what I would say counts for nothing in the bigger picture.
[3:40:49.400 --> 3:40:51.400]  And yet it matters immensely.
[3:40:51.400 --> 3:40:52.400]  All right.
[3:40:52.400 --> 3:40:54.400]  Now, how do you get there?
[3:40:54.400 --> 3:40:59.400]  Well, go outside tonight if it's a clear night and look at the universe as much of it as you can perceive.
[3:40:59.400 --> 3:41:08.400]  And then ask yourself how big are your problems in the eyes of the creation awareness of God, probably not very big.
[3:41:08.400 --> 3:41:10.400]  I don't care who you are.
[3:41:10.400 --> 3:41:16.400]  Whether you're a CEO, big company worrying about everything every day, or whether you're just a guy going to work,
[3:41:16.400 --> 3:41:21.400]  just a lady taking care of her kids and going to work doing her thing.
[3:41:21.400 --> 3:41:25.400]  But all of us have tremendous power, tremendous power.
[3:41:25.400 --> 3:41:27.400]  And so we got examples.
[3:41:27.400 --> 3:41:33.400]  Okay, we got a really cool examples of people who had tremendous power, but they didn't abuse it.
[3:41:33.400 --> 3:41:39.400]  You know, think about this when I always use it as a model and thinking about the Carlisle group.
[3:41:39.400 --> 3:41:48.400]  See, when they walked their 40 years or their 40 days in the desert after their baptism in the spirit,
[3:41:48.400 --> 3:41:50.400]  they were tempted.
[3:41:50.400 --> 3:41:54.400]  Remember that story after John the Baptist baptized his Christ.
[3:41:54.400 --> 3:41:59.400]  He walks in the desert and there's a lesson in all that's 40 days to equate to one generation,
[3:41:59.400 --> 3:42:02.400]  which is where I started this program in my own walk.
[3:42:02.400 --> 3:42:06.400]  And then he's tempted for 40 days.
[3:42:06.400 --> 3:42:08.400]  You can have anything in the world.
[3:42:08.400 --> 3:42:09.400]  You can have all of it.
[3:42:09.400 --> 3:42:11.400]  You know, you can have the whole thing.
[3:42:11.400 --> 3:42:12.400]  We already have the whole thing.
[3:42:12.400 --> 3:42:14.400]  You didn't need this guy to tell them anything.
[3:42:14.400 --> 3:42:19.400]  But the point is, most people in their 40 days in the desert make the wrong choice.
[3:42:19.400 --> 3:42:21.400]  They choose things in this world and miss the point.
[3:42:21.400 --> 3:42:22.400]  You can have all that.
[3:42:22.400 --> 3:42:23.400]  You will.
[3:42:23.400 --> 3:42:24.400]  You already do.
[3:42:24.400 --> 3:42:28.400]  The point is, you got to choose.
[3:42:28.400 --> 3:42:30.400]  Okay, so here's the thing.
[3:42:30.400 --> 3:42:33.400]  If you choose wrong and then you fall into the flesh and you're going to go through a bunch of things,
[3:42:33.400 --> 3:42:39.400]  maybe you'll come out of it because for God's sake, awareness, God wants to do.
[3:42:39.400 --> 3:42:45.400]  But here's what I'm saying about all that is, again, the things we face and the way we face them
[3:42:45.400 --> 3:42:52.400]  and then how we relate to the universe and how we relate to what we are determines our own filter up.
[3:42:52.400 --> 3:42:53.400]  All right?
[3:42:53.400 --> 3:42:55.400]  And I've said this before too.
[3:42:55.400 --> 3:42:57.400]  Don't believe what I'm saying.
[3:42:57.400 --> 3:42:59.400]  Figure it out on your own for sure.
[3:42:59.400 --> 3:43:07.400]  Because you need to know, you need to know, not parrot, not repeat, not memorize.
[3:43:07.400 --> 3:43:13.400]  You need to know certain things in order to grow into who you are and who's possible.
[3:43:13.400 --> 3:43:19.400]  And then you have inner power that you have the power to project out and you quit putting yourself down.
[3:43:19.400 --> 3:43:26.400]  You quit telling yourself how horrible you are because you see every blemish because every living soul always sees every blemish.
[3:43:26.400 --> 3:43:34.400]  But to ridicule the creation, the highest creation, if you believe that, is the human soul and the human being.
[3:43:34.400 --> 3:43:38.400]  And to be so critical, that's blasphemy against the creation.
[3:43:38.400 --> 3:43:43.400]  I'll say it again, it's blasphemy against creation when you carry it too far against yourself.
[3:43:43.400 --> 3:43:44.400]  It's a calling.
[3:43:44.400 --> 3:43:46.400]  It's a remembrance.
[3:43:46.400 --> 3:43:50.400]  It's a way to move you when you see something that needs to change.
[3:43:50.400 --> 3:43:51.400]  Make an effort.
[3:43:51.400 --> 3:43:52.400]  Do the best you can.
[3:43:52.400 --> 3:43:54.400]  The best you can.
[3:43:54.400 --> 3:43:56.400]  And that's an act of faith when you do that.
[3:43:56.400 --> 3:43:58.400]  And you fall down a lot on the way.
[3:43:58.400 --> 3:44:00.400]  I'm sure everybody does.
[3:44:00.400 --> 3:44:02.400]  But dust it off.
[3:44:02.400 --> 3:44:06.400]  If you're still standing, then the game ain't over and you're not done.
[3:44:06.400 --> 3:44:07.400]  Do it.
[3:44:07.400 --> 3:44:09.400]  Do life.
[3:44:09.400 --> 3:44:10.400]  Budget your life.
[3:44:10.400 --> 3:44:12.400]  Budget the breath of life.
[3:44:12.400 --> 3:44:16.400]  Every breath you take, budget that and figure out how much money you need to make it happen.
[3:44:16.400 --> 3:44:18.400]  That's what Alex has been doing.
[3:44:18.400 --> 3:44:20.400]  That's what I've been doing.
[3:44:20.400 --> 3:44:24.400]  And then everything comes into play and we all get to participate.
[3:44:24.400 --> 3:44:31.400]  But do something that changes the outcome for you first.
[3:44:31.400 --> 3:44:36.400]  So you have the inner power collected back and you have something to give to others and then start doing it.
[3:44:36.400 --> 3:44:41.400]  Meet people one at a time in your own transition, in your own transformation.
[3:44:41.400 --> 3:44:43.400]  Because that's what it's about right now.
[3:44:43.400 --> 3:44:52.400]  It's about shaking off the dust of this last 40 years and recreating the next 40, the next generation.
[3:44:52.400 --> 3:45:02.400]  Making sure that we're the gatekeepers of that generation and the set of values that created a country that created an idea that's held in the hearts of millions.
[3:45:02.400 --> 3:45:09.400]  Billions, I believe, who believe that freedom starts with the sovereign soul.
[3:45:09.400 --> 3:45:16.400]  Freedom to explore, freedom to search, freedom to know, and then freedom to act in a responsible way.
[3:45:16.400 --> 3:45:20.400]  This is Nick Begich. You're part of the Info Wars. Be part of that war.
[3:45:20.400 --> 3:45:44.400]  We'll be right back with the next segment of this program.
