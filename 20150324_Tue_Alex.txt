[00:00.000 --> 00:14.380]  It's all a sigh of the threat fusion centers the militarization of police military on the
[00:14.380 --> 00:20.240]  streets TSA on the streets during the Boston bombing half of the houses in the city searched
[00:20.240 --> 00:26.920]  without warrants women drug out of their homes at gunpoint it's all an exercise of power
[00:26.920 --> 00:33.480]  it's all a conditioning program to train the American people to accept what is only normal
[00:33.480 --> 00:38.880]  in third world dictatorships will we allow our journey towards despotism and tyranny
[00:38.880 --> 00:47.600]  to be complete or will we turn the situation around and restore our beloved republic police
[00:47.600 --> 01:01.260]  and national guard going street by street house to house they say there are no orders
[01:01.260 --> 01:08.520]  to use force just strong persuasion sometimes entering open houses with guns drawn instructions
[01:08.520 --> 01:16.840]  to disarm anyone inside we say guns will be taken no one will be able to be armed I am
[01:16.840 --> 01:23.160]  responding tonight directly to the southern command based in florida north com based in
[01:23.160 --> 01:29.520]  colorado springs colorado and to the foreign forces that have seized control of the district
[01:29.520 --> 01:36.720]  of columbia and are now dismantling our constitutional republic my name is alex jones i'm an american
[01:36.720 --> 01:42.240]  and a texan and for 20 years i've been on air fighting the globalist agenda their attempt
[01:42.240 --> 01:48.600]  to dismantle our country and our basic freedoms no one can deny that basic american liberties
[01:48.600 --> 01:54.320]  are being eroded that the constitution is being ignored that the executive branch is
[01:54.320 --> 02:01.080]  seizing control dissolving our borders signing us on to foreign treaties that kill our sovereignty
[02:01.080 --> 02:09.240]  it's all out in the open recently we reported on a public document put out by the us army
[02:09.240 --> 02:15.520]  special operations command about a two month training mission to be carried out in eight
[02:15.520 --> 02:23.840]  states in the document texas utah and conservative areas of southern california are listed as
[02:23.840 --> 02:30.600]  hostile areas now ladies and gentlemen i'm not just looking at this one document by
[02:30.600 --> 02:38.360]  itself though we've broken it down we're looking at the larger spectrum of the transformation
[02:38.360 --> 02:44.640]  of our military and police into a domestic paramilitary force that's now big mainstream
[02:44.640 --> 02:52.480]  news i was the first person back in 96 to really start hammering this not because i was that
[02:52.480 --> 02:57.600]  smart of a person but because the emergency manager of kingsville texas the police chief
[02:57.600 --> 03:02.920]  of san antonio and others reach out to me and said that they had been recruited to government
[03:02.920 --> 03:10.080]  meetings by clinton with army special operations to gauge whether or not they could condition
[03:10.080 --> 03:16.560]  the public to accept military occupation and gun confiscation the military basically
[03:16.560 --> 03:22.280]  rebelled against this leaked the information and the program was shelved under bullshit
[03:22.280 --> 03:31.040]  began to grow again and under obama it has exploded so tonight i am addressing the general
[03:31.040 --> 03:37.040]  enlisted the non-commissioned and the commissioned officers now high level commissioned officers
[03:37.040 --> 03:41.040]  pretty much have the whole picture they're not compartmentalized that's why you've seen
[03:41.040 --> 03:46.400]  a major purge of hundreds of generals and thousands of other officers the biggest in
[03:46.400 --> 03:52.720]  modern history because they wouldn't go along with the litmus test of accepting what the
[03:52.720 --> 03:57.600]  globalist wanted to do with our military turning it into a domestic control force over the
[03:57.600 --> 04:03.200]  people the reason i'm addressing the southern command and others directly tonight is because
[04:03.200 --> 04:07.400]  joe bigs and others in our office have been contacted and basically told to back off and
[04:07.400 --> 04:14.960]  shut up military dot com stars and stripes foreign newspapers you name it have all come

[08:36.520 --> 08:42.480]  sergeant joe biggs will be joining us at the bottom of the hour because of the fact
[08:42.480 --> 08:52.160]  that he and i are both being attacked now by name by the army times and scores of other
[08:52.160 --> 09:02.560]  publications and they are engaging in classic disinformation ops against the american people
[09:02.560 --> 09:14.200]  you can see the tactics of deception that are here and there is a fifteen minute video
[09:14.200 --> 09:20.800]  that i shot for the nightly news last night that's red linked on info wars dot com titled
[09:20.800 --> 09:27.720]  army and msm launched disinfo psyops against the american people special operations leadership
[09:27.720 --> 09:37.960]  attempts to downplay military drills listening texas is hostile and what they go on to deny
[09:37.960 --> 09:42.800]  is that there's basically any plan for the military to be used in domestic disturbances
[09:42.800 --> 09:48.840]  or for gun confiscation or for martial law when in the last twenty years we've seen it
[09:48.840 --> 09:57.880]  grow into a giant official main mission of north com and south com to suppress the american
[09:57.880 --> 10:05.600]  people they try to deceive the military and deceive the public and deceive law enforcement
[10:05.600 --> 10:12.600]  by saying oh there's anti-military groups that are claiming all these lies no in our
[10:12.600 --> 10:18.360]  report we shot last night we show more than forty mainstream news articles and official
[10:18.360 --> 10:27.840]  government documents stating the plan to have a national police force under the president
[10:27.840 --> 10:36.560]  commanded by the u.s. military it has nothing to do with the troops on the ground who are
[10:36.560 --> 10:43.080]  being basically put into these positions and the fact that they would deny for decades
[10:43.080 --> 10:46.720]  that they were militarizing or federalizing police that they would deny that they were
[10:46.720 --> 10:49.960]  moving towards the north american union that they would deny that they were moving towards
[10:49.960 --> 10:55.600]  a plan to dissolve the borders that was in the s.p.p. the security prosperity partnership
[10:55.600 --> 11:01.360]  that they would deny that there was even an asia pacific partnership that's now being
[11:01.360 --> 11:07.400]  ratified secretly and congress can't even get a copy of it that was in bloomberg and
[11:07.400 --> 11:16.400]  the guardian and cnbc sunday all of this is real all of this is happening and they don't
[11:16.400 --> 11:21.280]  want to ever admit any of its happening even though it's happening in plain view so that
[11:21.280 --> 11:30.960]  we could never have a debate about it the military is being also replaced with autonomous
[11:30.960 --> 11:42.160]  robots land sea and air that was announced a decade ago that by 2025 basically the entire
[11:42.160 --> 11:51.840]  fighting force would be robotic look at the brisbane times today robots to replace almost
[11:51.840 --> 12:02.800]  half of jobs over the next 20 years expert steve wasnack wasnik one of the founders
[12:02.800 --> 12:08.960]  of apple the future of ai is scary and very bad for people they're they're all warning
[12:08.960 --> 12:13.360]  us build joy you name it the ones that have a conscience you ask why does this tie into
[12:13.360 --> 12:21.320]  the military because the globalist are publicly building a world not for people we're having
[12:21.320 --> 12:27.760]  a debate about loving our military who doesn't archetypally love their warriors if a civilization
[12:27.760 --> 12:33.120]  doesn't respect their warriors they die if you don't respect your women you fall apart
[12:33.120 --> 12:38.760]  you don't respect children and the family you're died and all of that's being dismantled
[12:38.760 --> 12:42.480]  and the very globalist that have seized the country that have the borders wide open that
[12:42.480 --> 12:51.800]  are moving against our second amendment are in newsweek bloomberg daily beast new york
[12:51.800 --> 12:57.160]  magazine i mean i'm not exaggerating hundreds of publications in the last week not just
[12:57.160 --> 13:04.800]  on this military story but others have opened fire on us and i say praise the lord literally
[13:04.800 --> 13:09.840]  i love it when i get attacked i know i'm over the target that's my radar to go right in
[13:09.840 --> 13:15.400]  like a radar guided missile right into the enemy they turn on their radar to try to scan
[13:15.400 --> 13:21.040]  us try to attack us all that is a homing beacon for me to go right in on the enemy i point
[13:21.040 --> 13:30.440]  my nose right at the heaviest fire i can get and go straight in and it's really intensifying
[13:30.440 --> 13:35.640]  and i love it so bring it whatever it is and i'm not looking for a fight i'm not looking
[13:35.640 --> 13:39.600]  for trouble i'm not looking to be set up or killed but hey if that comes with it praise
[13:39.600 --> 13:44.640]  the lord it's part of god's plan i'm gonna tell the truth and i'm gonna expose abortion
[13:44.640 --> 13:50.520]  and i'm gonna expose gun control and open borders and planetary tyranny until i am six
[13:50.520 --> 13:56.960]  feet under pushing daisies until i'm on the black side not the green side you got it that's
[13:56.960 --> 14:03.440]  what's gonna happen it feels good in my soul in my heart in my intellect my morale's never
[14:03.440 --> 14:07.840]  been higher my cruise morale's never been higher and the liberty movement's morale's
[14:07.840 --> 14:15.680]  never been higher we are firing up to defeat the globalist end of story and folks can crawl
[14:15.680 --> 14:19.960]  in a ditch and submit to all this or live in denial about it and take their real cowards
[14:19.960 --> 14:25.360]  way out or you can decide to do something about it but if you want to do something about
[14:25.360 --> 14:30.520]  it you gotta first admit to yourself this war is going on and this war is real this republic
[14:30.520 --> 14:34.440]  is in a death battle right now with globalist forces that have seized control of district
[14:34.440 --> 14:43.760]  of criminals remember this article at a foreign policy washington post last year us repeals
[14:43.760 --> 14:50.680]  propaganda ban spreads government made news to americans and here's the latest articles
[14:50.680 --> 14:58.920]  today conspiracy groups question us a south com mission in texas and they go into attacking
[14:58.920 --> 15:07.440]  joe begs and myself a direct shaken bake this is a direct sigh up classic lies i knew what
[15:07.440 --> 15:11.840]  they would write before they wrote it and they've done it exactly as we knew they would
[15:11.840 --> 15:18.200]  what a joke what a sick joke to try to make everything we say sound like a lie without
[15:18.200 --> 15:29.000]  ever actually linking to our claims that's what they always do and this is meant to manipulate
[15:29.000 --> 15:34.280]  the military more than anybody else i remember when they came out for two weeks after katrina
[15:34.280 --> 15:38.520]  when we were reporting they were gun confiscating and they said no no one's doing that and then
[15:38.520 --> 15:42.880]  they decided to flip back go okay we'll just show the video on tv try to sell to the public
[15:42.880 --> 15:49.480]  on abc nbc cbs remember obama said i'm not coming after any of your guns not your rifles
[15:49.480 --> 15:55.200]  not your shotguns not your semi autos not your handguns he had joe biden said over and over
[15:55.200 --> 16:04.160]  again in the uh first campaign 2008 over and over again and then when he came after your
[16:04.160 --> 16:08.480]  guns he said we're not coming after your guns and bloomberg was in the news funding tens
[16:08.480 --> 16:13.480]  of millions of dollars a month to get our guns and to finance state elections and city elections
[16:13.480 --> 16:18.680]  all over the country he had an article he gave a speech saying i'm the most pro second
[16:18.680 --> 16:23.960]  amendment person there is i believe in the right to keep and bear arms while he was pushing
[16:23.960 --> 16:29.680]  the total abolition of civilian ownership of firearms and the un unity or treaty there
[16:29.680 --> 16:33.720]  is no attempt to put military on the streets there is no attempt to take your guns you
[16:33.720 --> 16:39.840]  can keep your doctor it'll cut your uh health bill in half to the cost of a phone bill or
[16:39.840 --> 16:44.080]  cable bill raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit you didn't build your
[16:44.080 --> 16:52.720]  business i'm not going to open up the borders i'm i mean do people recognize ball face
[16:52.720 --> 16:59.560]  lies when they're in our face i mean i'm not even that smart i just got common sense
[16:59.560 --> 17:04.760]  when people are sitting there shoveling lies and setting up classical tyrannies here in
[17:04.760 --> 17:10.440]  this republic they announced two weeks ago they're going to start executive action taking
[17:10.440 --> 17:18.880]  uh private i r a's and education funds they announced that they're going to start arresting
[17:18.880 --> 17:24.120]  anybody who keeps cash even though there's no law uh they are announcing all of this
[17:24.120 --> 17:33.680]  across the board right now it all goes together like a horse and carriage look at this article
[17:33.680 --> 17:40.240]  new york times mentioned this law lets irs sees accounts on suspicion no crime required
[17:40.240 --> 17:45.920]  and it talks about 40 years carol hinders dished out mexican specialties that are modest cash
[17:45.920 --> 17:54.160]  only restaurant had like eight seats at the at the diner for just as long she deposited
[17:54.160 --> 18:00.560]  the earnings in a small bank branch a block away and it goes through in the lengthy article
[18:00.560 --> 18:05.240]  that it was all had taxes paid on everything and that they still basically took everything
[18:05.240 --> 18:08.840]  out of her bank account and moved to start indicting her and then they admitted this
[18:08.840 --> 18:15.480]  happens to tens of thousands of people there isn't even a law they say law they interpret
[18:15.480 --> 18:23.680]  a law like the atf says they're interpreting this 223 situation so that headline is not
[18:23.680 --> 18:27.680]  even accurate but but this is what's going on now that dovetails with our article that's
[18:27.680 --> 18:35.320]  linked on drugsreport.com right now to talk about tyranny feds urge banks to call cops
[18:35.320 --> 18:42.600]  on customers who withdraw five thousand dollars or more when i take a crew of five or six
[18:42.600 --> 18:47.880]  reporters to europe i give them all two thousand dollars and they give me receipts but in case
[18:47.880 --> 18:54.880]  the cards quit working which happens all the time we've got money that's not we're carrying
[18:54.880 --> 18:59.200]  ten thousand dollars cash on us we're not criminals cash is illegal this whole phony
[18:59.200 --> 19:04.000]  drug war the banks launder the drug money publicly and then they act like we're criminal
[19:04.000 --> 19:10.640]  taking company money or after tax money out of the bank and then they've got kangaroo
[19:10.640 --> 19:16.440]  juries on these federal juries a lot of times are government agents and the judge will order
[19:16.440 --> 19:25.080]  them to convict you even though there's no statute there or the statute says tens of
[19:25.080 --> 19:30.240]  thousands of dollars over and over again that wasn't after tax that you're then keeping
[19:30.240 --> 19:35.000]  and not paying tax on but they just apply it to something else just like the irs is
[19:35.000 --> 19:39.040]  going after the tea party right now this is persecution we'll tell you about this when
[19:39.040 --> 19:46.840]  we come back but it all ties in together on every front we're going into a tyranny and
[19:46.840 --> 19:51.320]  a lot of people say well i'll just bend over do whatever i'm told that will ensure total
[19:51.320 --> 19:55.600]  destruction of our freedoms do you understand they're announcing they're going to take your
[19:55.600 --> 20:02.240]  pension funds that's why they're getting the army ready by now you know that wireless technology

[25:10.160 --> 25:17.040]  dictatorship known as technocracy over the planet this has been announced at devos this year last
[25:17.040 --> 25:21.760]  year in the year before it's been announced by Zbigniew Brzezinski all over the news and in three
[25:21.760 --> 25:28.880]  different four different books it's been announced on cnbc over and over and over again it's been
[25:28.880 --> 25:36.720]  announced in the financial times of london by their foreign editor who attacked us a few years ago
[25:36.720 --> 25:44.080]  and said and now for world government was the headline and then after we read his article on
[25:44.080 --> 25:51.360]  air he wrote another article attacking us by name and said world government doesn't exist
[25:52.160 --> 25:57.840]  and that we were insane this is the mind game they play no one's coming after your guns we just
[25:57.840 --> 26:04.240]  want you to turn them in and we got a bunch of bills to do it obama care cuts your prices in half
[26:04.240 --> 26:11.440]  even though it doubles or triples them it's classic gaslighting which is a psychological term known
[26:11.440 --> 26:16.080]  since the 30s where you walk up and say punch your wife in the nose and then she gets knocked out
[26:16.080 --> 26:20.480]  when she gets up you go baby i didn't punch you in the nose she's like i saw you and you know
[26:21.200 --> 26:26.160]  you fell and hit your nose and if you say it with enough confidence to a weak-minded person
[26:26.160 --> 26:33.600]  and they will actually believe it and that's what's happening is we're being gaslighted
[26:36.960 --> 26:40.960]  and gaslighting is a natural thing i'm sure you've all experienced a loved one or someone
[26:40.960 --> 26:46.720]  be really rude or mean to you and say something really horrible and you say you just said this
[26:46.720 --> 26:52.880]  to me and they'll go no i didn't you'll go yes you most certainly did 10 seconds ago
[26:52.880 --> 26:57.120]  no i didn't say that
[26:58.320 --> 27:03.600]  that is a tactic that we see more and more in this society and i'll say it psychologically and it's
[27:03.600 --> 27:09.360]  in the psychological research papers that are out there women do that more often than men and women
[27:09.360 --> 27:16.400]  are more susceptible to gaslighting women do it more and they're more susceptible to it now i'm
[27:16.400 --> 27:21.840]  not knocking women just in the psychological archetypes it's well known men are more likely
[27:21.840 --> 27:27.680]  to be psychopaths men are more likely to steal men are more likely to be into weird deviant bizarre
[27:27.680 --> 27:34.960]  stuff uh in the criminology effect i think it's something like 25 to 1 men committing murders
[27:34.960 --> 27:42.880]  to women it's almost 100 to 1 men being psychopaths versus women so i'm not bashing women but women
[27:43.840 --> 27:50.720]  are extremely suggestible and extremely manipulatable when they're in an unconscious state
[27:50.720 --> 27:55.520]  and the whole culture is about putting people in that state so what the pentagon's doing going
[27:55.520 --> 28:01.200]  there's no plan for the military on the streets it's crazy and anti-military there's no plan to
[28:01.200 --> 28:06.640]  militarize there's no plan to take over alex thinks we're taking over this summer we're not
[28:06.640 --> 28:12.560]  going to invade and take over the state house we didn't say you were going to do that we said in
[28:12.560 --> 28:17.760]  the john warner defense authorization act it talks about putting down rebellions in the states
[28:17.760 --> 28:24.800]  including governors and legislators look it up we said there's a plan for brigade homeland
[28:24.800 --> 28:30.960]  to have brigades in every region to suppress the people and in all your training manuals
[28:30.960 --> 28:36.000]  that we got and we broke that are now all over the news from the washington post to fox news
[28:36.000 --> 28:41.760]  you train to take on your new number one enemy and it didn't ice this it didn't iran it didn't

[40:01.760 --> 40:06.000]  the globalist that have hijacked our country that again on cnbc admit they have i mean this is all
[40:06.000 --> 40:10.880]  over the news we're going into secret treaties right now 33 secret points one point was leaked
[40:10.880 --> 40:15.280]  last year by wiki leaks total end of internet freedom you notice they just did the power grab
[40:15.280 --> 40:21.120]  with the fcc to get in line with the treaty that congress can't even see just like the head of the
[40:21.120 --> 40:27.120]  fcc said i'm not even going to meet with congress i mean they're announcing they're going to arrest
[40:27.120 --> 40:30.640]  you for pulling any cash out of the bank five thousand dollars they're they're announcing
[40:30.640 --> 40:36.560]  they're getting ready to take your your your kids education funds i mean it just it's so much tyranny
[40:38.320 --> 40:44.960]  on a scale of one to ten it's a ten that it's moving so fast it is moving at warp speed and then
[40:45.840 --> 40:51.840]  we get sent by one of our sources i'll leave it at that that hey this is hidden behind a firewall
[40:52.720 --> 40:58.000]  but it's unclassified they're supposed to be releasing this a little bird just put it on
[40:58.000 --> 41:04.880]  scripts the big document site so that's a trick when something's supposed to be declassified
[41:04.880 --> 41:10.960]  they'll still hide it so now for four or five days they've had the different publications
[41:10.960 --> 41:16.640]  stars and stripes military dot com and others going we don't know if the documents real but
[41:16.640 --> 41:23.360]  these conspiracy theorists uh uh you know claim that we want to take over texas in utah this this
[41:23.360 --> 41:27.920]  summer and martial law we're not going to have martial law this summer you notice how they'll
[41:27.920 --> 41:34.080]  deny the operation though whatsoever they just keep trying to you know move the attention away
[41:34.080 --> 41:38.240]  from the fact that that's going on and just keep throwing out the conspiracy term and keep attacking
[41:38.240 --> 41:43.040]  us so it takes people's attention off of the fact that there that there is a mission going to happen
[41:43.040 --> 41:48.240]  just like it says in the documents they're not denying it and then you got contacted by one of
[41:48.240 --> 41:53.120]  your friends that you served with yeah saying shut up it's a sigh up get you none of your business yeah
[41:54.080 --> 41:58.880]  and then i have the washington post u.s repeals propaganda ban spreads government made news i
[41:58.880 --> 42:03.840]  want to get your take on this show but give them people background here they're now in army times
[42:03.840 --> 42:11.040]  today saying the headline on info wars reads feds preparing to invade texas list state is hostile
[42:11.040 --> 42:16.800]  state uh site founder alex jones said in a tape segment that it's likely preparation for military
[42:16.800 --> 42:21.280]  actions to follow an imminent financial collapse on the end of morocco obama's presidential term
[42:22.000 --> 42:25.760]  and another segment on the side they try to act like we're confused no we're throwing out different
[42:25.760 --> 42:31.680]  different options here different scenarios joe big cited as a veteran of afghanistan and iraq
[42:31.680 --> 42:36.320]  you've been in the army times many times i mean they don't feel loading munitions said the exercises
[42:36.320 --> 42:40.480]  would prepare troops to throw citizens and fema federal emergency management camps
[42:40.480 --> 42:44.160]  citing his evidence the military's desire to train an environment similar to where they'll fight
[42:44.160 --> 42:49.920]  well they say in the document to win our hearts and minds then they go on but if you read the whole
[42:49.920 --> 42:54.320]  article they call us conspiracy theorists they say oh it's for overseas well obviously it has dual
[42:54.320 --> 43:02.880]  uses but then they never debate the stacks of articles that we show in our video on info wars
[43:02.880 --> 43:09.120]  dot com it's red linked right now that i shot last night army and msm uh launched this info
[43:09.120 --> 43:14.320]  saw up against american people we show more than 40 news articles and brand corporation and pentagon
[43:14.320 --> 43:20.160]  documents admitting the main missions conservatives libertarians gun owners and tea party every chance
[43:20.160 --> 43:26.560]  they get during an emergency they're gun confiscating to get to see if the military will do it and so
[43:26.560 --> 43:31.120]  it's not that we're against the military we're against them being put in this position and joe
[43:31.120 --> 43:36.960]  the reason we know about this is because the military has been leaking the info before it was
[43:36.960 --> 43:42.160]  even declassified because they don't like being given this unconstitutional training so there's a
[43:42.160 --> 43:46.720]  battle not just for the hearts and minds of the people to go along with this but the military
[43:47.440 --> 43:53.760]  you've got a joint command of the navy the air force and the army and the marines all four groups
[43:53.760 --> 44:00.480]  the marines under the navy with the sailors and soldiers of the army training clearly for logistics
[44:00.480 --> 44:05.600]  and to condition the public for military operations domestically this is happening everywhere and they
[44:05.600 --> 44:11.040]  admit in their incorporation documents that we cite that it's part of a societal quote evolution
[44:11.040 --> 44:17.200]  towards the acceptance of a national police force administered by north com so north com really runs
[44:17.200 --> 44:23.120]  it but so south com is going to coordinate it uh joe it's outrageous so as a veteran
[44:23.120 --> 44:28.960]  that estimates on the inside of this what is your breakdown uh on what's currently happening well
[44:28.960 --> 44:33.520]  like you said earlier in the broadcast alex real over the target they are shooting at us on all
[44:33.520 --> 44:39.360]  fronts now because we have essentially hit a nerve you know i expect way more attacks to come i'm
[44:39.360 --> 44:44.320]  expecting way more attacks on my own service and what i've done i'm sure they're going to be coming
[44:44.320 --> 44:48.400]  out in different articles saying this and that i feel like you said it's clearly out there my record
[44:48.400 --> 44:54.400]  of what i've done is out there for people to see it's in dan rather reports episode the commander
[44:55.120 --> 45:00.640]  gq obama's war men's journal all these different things show what i've done in my service and yet
[45:00.640 --> 45:05.680]  they want to come and attack us and say that i'm cited as that that's the one thing that just really
[45:05.680 --> 45:11.440]  pisses me off that they're going to go and say that i'm cited no no no i am a retired army staff
[45:11.440 --> 45:15.840]  sergeant so i mean that's the end of the point with that but i mean this pisses me off to know
[45:15.840 --> 45:20.080]  that they're going to go and attack us because we're exposing the fact that they're trying to
[45:20.080 --> 45:27.120]  condition people to go along with this bs it's disgusting and like you said the people who are
[45:27.120 --> 45:32.160]  leaking this stuff to us are soldiers in the military because they see what's going on is wrong
[45:32.160 --> 45:35.840]  they want to get it out there they know they can do it so they use people like us because they know
[45:35.840 --> 45:39.040]  we're going to do the right thing well that's exactly what's going on and more importantly
[45:39.040 --> 45:44.640]  than people on the outside they're assessing the officers the enlisted the non-commissioned
[45:44.640 --> 45:50.880]  they're assessing for the first for future purges it's already going on who is playing ball in the
[45:50.880 --> 45:56.800]  navy seals the delta force the marines the army rangers that's what this is is an assessment
[45:56.800 --> 46:01.360]  and they're going to have domestic groups guys in plain clothes driving around pulling all sorts
[46:01.360 --> 46:05.360]  of stuff i used to go out and cover these events when clinton was trying this see they've tried
[46:05.360 --> 46:10.640]  before and the military rejected that's how i how i learned about this police and military
[46:10.640 --> 46:16.320]  rejected it joe and we would go out and had them break in our hotel rooms pull guns on us
[46:16.320 --> 46:22.720]  they had an army guy start setting fires in florida trying to blame it on us i mean let me
[46:22.720 --> 46:28.000]  explain folks this is dangerous to cover this because this is the globalist trying to run a
[46:28.000 --> 46:35.360]  sigh up on the military yeah i mean this is completely and totally out of control and if
[46:35.360 --> 46:40.000]  you notice that in the articles they go well they show these slides where it states that they say
[46:40.000 --> 46:44.960]  that the operators will be conducting suspicious activity they never go no that's not what it
[46:44.960 --> 46:49.360]  it's we didn't say that they just say that we're stating that like i said they keep changing
[46:49.360 --> 46:53.280]  they keep moving the attention away they never once denied the fact those slides exist and that
[46:53.280 --> 46:57.600]  all the stuff written in it is real and there's going to be real training to stop terrorists
[46:57.600 --> 47:02.000]  blowing up power plants there's going to be real training for afghanistan but because i've been to
[47:02.000 --> 47:06.720]  no exaggeration 30 or 40 of these and my crew's been to more than that but inside of that they're
[47:06.720 --> 47:11.440]  going to have missions to take over courthouses and capitals and have nighttime raids and
[47:11.440 --> 47:17.120]  snatch and grabs and to take out the states well a mission just ended with the u.s army soldiers
[47:17.120 --> 47:21.840]  from the 202 military intelligence battalion in salt lake city utah they were conducting scenario
[47:21.840 --> 47:27.520]  based surveillance either dismounted walking or mounted driving dress and civilian clothes
[47:28.320 --> 47:35.120]  walking through the seats doing the surveillance spy you know my dad's uncle just died two years ago
[47:35.120 --> 47:41.920]  and i mean he was an army officer and after that got recruited to the cia and all he told my dad was
[47:41.920 --> 47:46.960]  he's dead now but my dad knew about it was that he basically was a hit man for the cia that's who
[47:46.960 --> 47:51.200]  they recruit his army officers but they just sit here act like this has never been going on
[47:51.200 --> 47:55.680]  they just play stupid joe and i'm sick of it but now they're not training army officers
[47:55.680 --> 48:00.800]  to say take out russian spies in chicago the kind of stuff that my dad's uncle would do
[48:01.760 --> 48:06.560]  their training to take on the team party with hit teams and that's illegal and we're going to talk
[48:06.560 --> 48:11.120]  about it well they know we're right that's why they keep calling us conspiracy groups because
[48:11.120 --> 48:15.120]  years ago when we talked about the phone spying on you but the phone's having the back door to the
[48:15.120 --> 48:18.880]  nsa when we said that the tv's were listening to you when we said all this was going on they said
[48:18.880 --> 48:23.280]  we were crazy they said we're conspiracy theorists and now it's all come out it's just like unless
[48:23.280 --> 48:28.400]  snopes writes about her if it's on fox it's not true but we all know now that that's what's going on
[48:28.400 --> 48:32.720]  when michael hasings got a hit his car blew up we said that there was he said i'm running they're
[48:32.720 --> 48:36.000]  coming out but you talked to his friends and they killed him and we said it's possible that a car
[48:36.000 --> 48:40.160]  could be hacked taken over and something like that could happen no you guys are crazy you're out of
[48:40.160 --> 48:44.960]  your mind now it's all over mainstream media and it's okay now they kind of forget the the fact
[48:44.960 --> 48:49.120]  that they bash us the entire time and now we're kind of like okay they let us back in and then
[48:49.120 --> 48:52.880]  now we come out talking about this but wonder how they're going to fill in about five years
[48:52.880 --> 48:57.360]  when they're all locked up well hastings became a total patriot his wife's obviously a high level
[48:57.360 --> 49:02.960]  spy working at the national security council in the actual star chamber and hastings issues there
[49:02.960 --> 49:06.880]  was a lot of battles with you wasn't scared at all compared to other media he was a the bravest
[49:06.880 --> 49:11.840]  journalist i'd ever seen in combat and that's why he got all those powerful reports he went on tv and
[49:11.840 --> 49:16.800]  said evil's taken over republicans and democrats are run the nation's going under tyranny we have to
[49:16.800 --> 49:23.520]  declare war on this and they killed him i mean they could kill us tomorrow and don't say that we
[49:23.520 --> 49:28.160]  crashed the car folks or that we killed ourselves it's not true and we're not whining we're not
[49:28.160 --> 49:32.080]  worried about it we're doing the right thing here there's no way we could just back down from this
[49:32.080 --> 49:37.440]  but to watch them sit there and deny this is going on they've got a problem show you talked to the
[49:37.440 --> 49:41.680]  military i talked to the military almost all of them are awake to what's going on oh yeah it's not
[49:41.680 --> 49:45.360]  of soldiers you have to worry about it's not the lower enlisted guys it's the one who've been there
[49:45.360 --> 49:50.400]  for years and years who are basically politicians at this point working at the pentagon things like
[49:50.400 --> 49:54.480]  that those are the ones you have to worry about it's not your everyday private to sergeant first
[49:54.480 --> 49:58.720]  class master sergeant type rings you've got to worry about these are the guys who are just basically
[49:58.720 --> 50:02.720]  trying to make a living they want to get out do their time take care of their family go out go
[50:02.720 --> 50:08.240]  home go shoot guns have a barbecue you know just live the american life they're not out there and
[50:08.240 --> 50:12.080]  now they've been listed as the number one enemy when they have to take over and that's the pentagon
[50:12.080 --> 50:16.800]  can't get around the hundreds of documents saying that they're going to target the vets well it's
[50:16.800 --> 50:20.160]  another thing too a lot of my friends who are wanting to get out are now scared to get out
[50:20.160 --> 50:24.800]  and are willing to reenlist for another 10 years or so to finish off their to get their retirement
[50:24.800 --> 50:28.560]  because they know that the va so bad they know that they're not going to be taken care of that
[50:28.560 --> 50:32.640]  they have depression problems they know that they've had problems with drug addiction when it comes
[50:32.640 --> 50:36.480]  to percussets and things like that these are problems created how are you doing are you finally

[50:40.800 --> 50:44.880]  i just stopped going to the va at this point in time it really doesn't matter i just i leave it

[54:06.720 --> 54:19.760]  i was a prisoner of doubt well there is no doubt that the globalists have accelerated their take
[54:19.760 --> 54:28.560]  over 300 last year that's my real guesstimate 300 all hell is breaking loose and the real
[54:28.560 --> 54:33.920]  sigh up here is they're putting the military and the police in unconstitutional missions
[54:33.920 --> 54:39.520]  that are going to demonize them with the people and then the globalists don't get the blame and
[54:39.520 --> 54:44.960]  sit there and deny it's going on or then offer reforms that actually give them even more power
[54:44.960 --> 54:51.040]  over the police and military so we owe it to the military to not let them be used in this treasonous
[54:51.040 --> 54:56.560]  way and again i'll say it the most await groups the military next is the police and the police
[54:56.560 --> 55:00.720]  have some of the biggest problems out there but that's how the world works it's usually a paradox
[55:00.720 --> 55:06.960]  like america is the world's hope or the world's damnation the military and the police are our hope
[55:06.960 --> 55:12.560]  or our damnation that's how it works you are the hope listeners or our damnation
[55:14.080 --> 55:20.000]  you are the resistance you are the answer america is great america has been special america was given
[55:20.000 --> 55:26.320]  providence towards washington and our founders were amazing they did change the world do we just
[55:26.320 --> 55:31.280]  let the globalist usurp that and use a bunch of fancy propaganda on us look around you
[55:32.320 --> 55:38.800]  tyranny is accelerating and they're going to target everyone they put tyrannies in place to rob
[55:38.800 --> 55:45.440]  populations to make you poor to conquer you globalist want to conquer nations and enslave
[55:45.440 --> 55:52.640]  our founders wanted wealth and power and prestige they believe in humanity it's a renaissance economy
[55:52.640 --> 56:00.160]  or a conquering economy we become an empire and now the empire is in trouble and it's looking to
[56:00.160 --> 56:06.400]  enslave us domestically because the empire is meant to fall into the larger global government empire
[56:07.760 --> 56:12.160]  and they're telling those in the american empire set up this police state purge your people
[56:12.160 --> 56:15.600]  and you'll run the empire but in truth they're going to be set up in the end as well
[56:15.600 --> 56:22.240]  david rockefeller and brzezinski have written books it's a plan to triple cross send out a lot of
[56:22.240 --> 56:26.320]  military brass others they go yeah we're an empire big deal the world's rough yeah we do evil stuff
[56:26.320 --> 56:30.320]  but be glad it's us not somebody else we're gonna we're gonna run it here from the top and it'll be
[56:30.320 --> 56:34.320]  all right joe's why i think he's still alive you know we ought to really join us stop me and
[56:34.320 --> 56:38.800]  i've been told this by famous you name it you've heard someone on the show and but off record
[56:38.800 --> 56:43.680]  trying to get me to join him and i'm just like look long term this is going to end up screwing
[56:43.680 --> 56:48.560]  everybody getting rid of due process is like the ring of mordor it will bite you in the butt every
[56:48.560 --> 56:56.160]  time i will not be part of this joe biggs again what do you make of the massive roll out of tsa
[56:56.160 --> 57:01.040]  on the streets military popping up everywhere tsa popping up what do you think they're building
[57:01.040 --> 57:05.520]  towards joe why do you think they're accelerating the power grab it was like with the 1033 program
[57:05.520 --> 57:10.720]  they're bringing all this military gear in dumping it off and do i really think that they want these
[57:10.720 --> 57:14.800]  police departments and fire departments to really use them no it's almost like the mentality
[57:14.800 --> 57:20.480]  uh when you're back in uh garrison in the army you let the privates take care of the equipment
[57:20.480 --> 57:24.720]  and when it's time to go train and actually do an exercise or to actually use it in combat
[57:24.720 --> 57:28.880]  then you get to go play with the toy the government's dumping off all this stuff strategically placing
[57:28.880 --> 57:33.360]  it all across letting locals pay for the upkeep yes let them pay for the upkeep let them do the
[57:33.360 --> 57:37.600]  maintenance all that make sure everything's fine and when it's time they want to come in
[57:37.600 --> 57:41.120]  they take it over they will use it they will be the ones running up and down the street
[57:41.120 --> 57:45.280]  driving the m-wraps and they'll be essentially pushing the police aside making them do smaller
[57:45.280 --> 57:49.600]  tasks but the government will be the ones who run in and the police will be like interns yeah
[57:50.640 --> 57:55.120]  they're the ones who are doing the stuff now the no knock rays all this feel like hey
[57:55.120 --> 57:59.760]  i'm gonna you know this is gonna pay off one day but it's not going to you know all this stuff
[57:59.760 --> 58:03.600]  that they're doing right now is horrible no knock raids are the worst thing ever and then on top
[58:03.600 --> 58:07.280]  of that you start adding these m-wraps to it you're rolling up you're scaring the hell out of pee
[58:07.280 --> 58:11.600]  they're expanding and quadrupling the size of swat teams i mean they're doing warrants service
[58:11.600 --> 58:16.320]  now just on marijuana stuff with armored vehicles and in in middle of the night stuff it's a it's a
[58:16.320 --> 58:21.840]  terror force yeah exactly i mean you've got to think most people have some kind of firearm at

[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:35.920]  but guess what there's so many military people out there i know each and every day who have our
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:41.280]  backs and who will stand up and do the right thing that's right and the more they lie the more they
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:46.240]  lose credibility i mean they're the the military knows that there's unprecedented riot training
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:50.080]  and gun confiscation training going on it's all over the news there's cities all over texas they just
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:54.240]  say we're full of it because we say it's a bad idea there's cities all over texas right now popping
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:59.120]  up on their websites like san angelo today for instance for for instance came out saying that
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:06.480]  they will accept the socoms uh uh invitation to basically come out there and run the operations
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:10.640]  and then just east or west and what this is about is creating a relationship with the locals
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:16.240]  for a future occupation and that's what i was told by the emergency manager vietnam veteran
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:23.120]  thomas sanchez over kingsville in 1998 he said they came to us it's in preparation
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:27.200]  for a domestic takeover and to see who will go along with it and then i was told by the police
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:32.000]  chief of san antonio on video it's not like they've been trying this forever joe the good news
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.200]  is we're holding it back yeah go ahead just west of abalone they came out there's a city uh can't
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:40.880]  remember what's called like howard county something like that where they said they've already accepted
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:44.880]  the invitation as well and there's going to be a lot of airborne operations going on so troops
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:49.280]  jumping out of planes like red dawn coming in landing in your backyard that's going to scare the
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:53.680]  living hell out of people knowing this is going on why can't you do this on your own base we have
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:58.240]  installations that are built for training they have ford hood that's like a tenth of texas i mean
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:03.840]  now but that's how you know it's a scyop why we have so much money we've dumped into these training

[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:33.840]  and then we learned part of the training was tea party the military is training the police

[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:09.680]  the va now admitted or that it didn't increase your prices when it did or didn't get rid of your
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:14.880]  doctor they lie until it's in place they don't want to debate about this now just like they'd say
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:19.920]  anthrax shots aren't killing the troops in 2001 and then they later admitted it was deadly and quit
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:24.640]  it we were called kooks then so we're not even defending ourselves this is a good thing they're
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:30.480]  attacking us but the imagine a civil war in america that they want to start stirring up people
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:35.680]  against the police all of this joe bigs as a veteran i mean what do you make of this and and
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:40.720]  what would happen if there was a real civil war in america obviously that would be very uh
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:47.120]  very good at first but you gotta think like i said before the lower soldiers the guys who were in
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:51.360]  there you know right out of high school out of college they're not the ones you got to worry
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:55.200]  about it so ones at the pentagon it's the people up there who are in the politics are the ones who
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:59.440]  work with the you know the big money those are the ones you have to worry about to make those kind
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:04.400]  of decisions and this is the thing this is part of the sigh up how how are we a civilians going to
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:09.680]  know when this is a mission or a training exercise that's right and then when are the soldiers going
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:13.680]  to know the difference between a training exercise and hey all the sudden we're actually going out
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:17.520]  on the streets and being told to do that and that's what they admit it for and if you watch the charlton
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:23.520]  heston uh peace on history channel about the pen of the panaman invasion they did the same thing
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:27.600]  for six months before the real deal there yeah exactly so that's the thing that's the sigh up
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:31.440]  with us it's confusing people to not know when it's going to be a training exercise and an actual
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:36.800]  mission and you were told by your buddy uh from iraq in afghanistan who's now at socombe yeah if
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:41.600]  he's down in tampa florida he said yeah shut up bigs it is a sigh yep exactly board for word
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:46.880]  i mean it's out there it's in your face i mean there's not more we can do we're telling you
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:51.520]  we're showing you the documents and like i said socombe's not denying that these are real slides
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:56.480]  that information's on there they're just trying to take the they just try to they now finally admit
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:01.280]  it for four or five days it was oh we don't know if it's even real now okay it's real yeah and then
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:05.680]  they misrepresent what we're saying we have these local cities that are popping up accepting the
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:11.120]  invitation for operation jade jade home to go live in their cities and by the way guys if you go to
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:15.920]  youtube and type in alex jones san antonio police chief or alex jones delta force you can see the
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:20.880]  30 minute interview in the film is 30 minutes this is actually an hour along with alex phillipus
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:27.360]  who's in army intelligence himself delta force came in with $200,000 in 1999 1998 in his office
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:31.680]  and said we want you to work in secret operations with us here locally and it was basically narcotics
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:36.800]  trafficking uh and a bunch it was delta force and he said no way and then he found out a bunch of the
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:41.760]  city officials had taken the money once you take the money you're now compromised they were there
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:48.160]  in an infiltration op the same ones you use to buy off third world countries like guatemala or whatever
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:54.480]  they were doing it to them well it turns out most police chiefs take the money yeah can you believe
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:59.120]  this show well like i said when i was in the military they would shove percocet down our throat
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:04.240]  and a lot of people have to have adverse reactions have to go to these uh like AA meetings type things
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:08.640]  you'd have to go for uh if you were drunk and got into a fight and which is what happened to me one
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:13.680]  time i had to go to like an AA meeting and in there was a delta force commando guy who was there
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:19.200]  because he was caught smuggling heroin from afghanistan into the states so you know what's
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:23.520]  happening you know that since the government's been over there since the u.s. army has been
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:28.320]  running operations in afghanistan to the opium production gone up like tenfold and again that
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:33.120]  too gets in the higher rooms the guys that will torture that will deal drugs i mean if you'll do
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:36.720]  that you're going to get a big house in hawaii though mainstream media is not going to cover
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:42.000]  this stuff that's what we do at info wars we cover real topics and we encourage people to go go do
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.640]  the research themselves sure well they can't snow job me i'm from texas i mean it's got to be a third
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:52.320]  of my family has been recruited and been in this and that's what's saying my family something special
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:57.520]  this underground government is so big that you can't swing a stick in any direction in texas
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:01.520]  and not hit somebody that's in this we're over the target and they're attacking us and it shows
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:05.520]  that we're actually getting out and we're reaching people like kip daniel's article yesterday showing
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:10.480]  that we be espn cbs all these different people in the comments and all it because we actually
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:15.440]  spark real issue that we have more ratings than them more commenters more traffic exactly because
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:19.600]  we're really doing something we talk about the things that the mainstream media is too scared to
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:22.800]  because everything's so politically correct nowadays that's what's discussed everybody's
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:27.680]  scared to get attacked or killed and i mean i'm not bending over to this we need a man up and do
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:34.160]  something i don't bend over for anybody i'm sorry i'm a fighter i don't run i'm not going anywhere
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:38.800]  if the country goes to hell i'm staying here and i'm fighting i will not leave this is my country
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:43.840]  i will not go job joe that's my attitude as well brother oh bless you know you're awesome all right
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:48.240]  joe bigs thank you so much god bless you we're gonna keep dr joel wallock 15 minutes the next hour
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:53.280]  if he can do it then we'll cover all the other news and take your calls i cannot this is another
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:16:00.960]  major fight we're about to cover here this is so exciting because we know that as cancer goes up
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:05.200]  3 000 percent in breast cancer 10 000 plus percent in many pediatric cancers are higher
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:10.400]  that we know the answer it's not that oh our genetics suddenly all fell apart so cancer is
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:14.800]  going off the chart you 20 years ago 30 years ago 40 years ago you couldn't find a kid with cancer
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:20.880]  now you can't walk down the street not see kids with cancer why is all of this so epidemic well
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:25.200]  it's because ladies and gentlemen we're not getting the basic nutrients and vitamins and minerals we
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:29.920]  need just like a plant will die if it doesn't happen and then your genes break down and yes if
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:36.880]  you're predisposed to toxins triggering your cancer then that will basically happen from the main
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:41.840]  line research they know this but they go on the news now and they say your kid has behavior problems
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:46.480]  because of bad genes or get your breast and ovaries removed your testicles removed because you might get
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:53.680]  cancer yes you have the genetic switch to get that cancer we all do i mean you know the the men in my
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:17:02.400]  family either live to be about 89 years old 79 years old 82 years old 95 years old or they
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:07.840]  doubt about 51 of a giant heart attack you make it past that you live to your 85 that's genetically
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:13.680]  we got big hearts aggressive but we have giant heart attacks and just die okay that's that is
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:17.680]  genetic but i need to then do things because i'm predisposed not to do that we all know i'm not
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:23.120]  doing those things so whatever i'll take a long dirt nap but it's not my genetics it's that the
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:29.680]  environment and the way i'm behaving will then make me flip those switches genetics low loads the
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:35.120]  gun environment pulls the trigger and we have the man who doesn't like to talk about himself we're
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:41.840]  going to skip this network break dr. joel wallach he wrote dead doctors don't lie his new book epigenetics
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:48.800]  available in info or store.com is so important especially in light of angelina joe lee has ovaries
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:53.680]  removed quote i know my children will never have to say mom died of ovarian cancer well what if
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:58.720]  you're predisposed to brain cancer can have your brain removed i mean instead of looking for why the
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:06.880]  cancer is increasing we look for how to cure it or medicate it so joining us is dr. joel wallach and
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:12.960]  i really appreciate him joining us info wars team.com i'm in business with him and he helped found
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:20.000]  young jevity 18 years ago one of the biggest the most successful non-gmo organic uh companies out
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.000]  there info wars health.com info wars life.com i'm not going to really infomercial today he's not

[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:58.800]  the highest quality the ontane and tangerine 2.0 the alex pack you name it but we'll get into that
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:06.400]  at the end of the interview dr. joel wallach joins us uh he of course uh has published numerous books
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:11.360]  on dietary deficiencies conducts approximately 300 lectures annually has sold over 40 million copies
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:14.960]  of dead doctors don't lie born and raised in missouri dr. wallach attended the university of
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:20.560]  missouri and received a bachelor's degree in the science of agriculture a veterinarian for 30 years
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:26.640]  he worked as a research veterinary pathologist at several institutes and universities including
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:31.280]  york's regional primate research center in atlanta where he discovered and identified the first
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:37.600]  animal models of we're going to skip this break guys at the network for cystic fibrosis monkeys
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:43.040]  he found uh that he could reproduce their condition and will because it was nutritional
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:47.600]  deficiency well yeah if you don't eat vitamin c you'll get scurvy in your teeth or fall out
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:51.040]  and old wounds will open up but they people got scurvy all over the place i talked to medical
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:54.400]  doctors they won't tell you take vitamin c when you have lesions all over your body they just won't
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:58.960]  tell you what it is dr. wallach then made the decision to go to medical school so he could
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:03.280]  treat children for cystic fibrosis himself he taught nutrition at the national college of
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:08.080]  naturopathic medicine in oregon became a primary care physician with a naturopathic degree 97
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:12.960]  wallach established his very own company american longevity now young jeopardy info wars team dot
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:17.840]  com info wars health dot com he consults and advises us there their entire spectrum more than 400
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:23.120]  products are available they're discounted at the highest level info wars store dot com also has
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:28.800]  links to it but that's not what we're getting into we're getting into angelina joe lee what's
[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:34.000]  triggering the genes to then cause the meltdown why are the pediatric cancers off the charts
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.480]  why is the diabetes off the charts and i know wallach is conservative even though he's won
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:43.840]  in court over this it won't say a hundred percent they can cure diabetes type type type two but i
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:50.240]  now heard governor huckabee on this network with ads and on fox news running ads saying that they
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:55.200]  can cure it and what's amazing is the research shows you really can in many cases or at least
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:21:01.520]  mitigate but they won't tell people but it means the dam must be breaking if huckabee is out there
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:07.360]  doing this what do you think the fda says about that joe wallach well thank you so much alex for
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:12.400]  your time and your hospitality i always appreciate you when i'm on the road i love listening to you
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:17.280]  and all your guests um but if you want to jump in right away on type 2 diabetes so we've known for
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:22.640]  70 years alex it's a deficiency of a single mineral type 2 diabetes which makes up 98 percent of the
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:28.880]  uh population of diabetics in america we can make in america a diabetes free country in two months
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:33.680]  if they were just to take um all 90 cents in your transfer a little bit of extra what we call the
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:40.000]  secret sauce that has that mineral in it and um it's so great to be able to do this we can do
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.960]  this for church families we're actually put proposal and then the small island nations that have only
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:51.280]  280 000 citizens and we're going to have to uh demonstrate this we can eliminate type 2 diabetes
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:55.440]  in this little nation it's the highest percentage obviously if it's a small nation it's not the
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:00.480]  biggest numbers but percentage wise they have the highest rate of diabetes and that's if your
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:05.040]  pancreas isn't too far gone though right well actually it has nothing to do with the pancreas
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:10.320]  that's all a myth when you have type 2 diabetes there's nothing wrong with your pancreas uh it's
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:14.080]  just there's a communication problem between the insulin produced by your pancreas so it's
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:19.760]  so the receptors can absorb it that's correct let me ask you this question how could huckabee
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:25.760]  be running national ads saying saying basically what you're saying now i mean he's he's at the
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:30.240]  highest levels of the establishment uh that must mean they know they can't stop this information
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:36.480]  coming out that's right well i've been harping on this now for 36 years uh alex no you're the
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:41.760]  granddaddy of exposing it there's no doubt yeah and so this is one of the reasons why the audio
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:46.720]  cassette tape and now the cd which we sold 280 million by the way the cd 280 million they're
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:53.040]  still going out the door at 50 000 a week and um uh this is one of the controversial things was back
[01:22:53.040 --> 01:23:00.000]  then um when it first came out in 1992 i said that type 2 diabetes is a simple mineral deficiency and
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.240]  and we can eliminate type 2 diabetes in weeks sometimes it was certainly within two months
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:08.320]  and when we do this with an entire country uh the world will not be able to fight it now we've
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:13.120]  done it in animals over and over and over and i knew it wasn't genetic uh when i did this big
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:18.240]  project with marlon perkins where i did 20 000 autopsies uh 10 million chemistries looking for
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:23.360]  pollution as a contributor to our health problems i found that crocodiles and alligators got type
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:29.280]  2 diabetes and how does a crocodile and alligator get a genetic disease from humans our antelope
[01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:33.360]  and and deer get the sickle cell anemia which is supposed to be a genetically transmitted
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:37.680]  disease in the african-american population so i knew the genetics was not the answer
[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:44.400]  or way back in in the 1960s and that became part of the audio cassette tape that dead doctors don't
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:49.440]  lie well what else is going on now i mean we've done for 50 years that folic acid if you don't
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:55.280]  have it you get deformities and low IQs now the feds are moving to block folic acid as a supplement
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:24:00.240]  i mean how obvious in fact that was in ap last week i never covered it guys type in feds moved
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:04.640]  to block folic acid being added to bread and tortillas when latin america started doing it
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:08.880]  decades ago and saw a total reversal and deformities my dad's been involved as a doctor in aid
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:14.880]  missions down there himself well i mean how evil is the government that they don't want folic acid
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:19.920]  well this is only the tip of the iceberg the folic acid thing it's one of my eight lawsuits
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:25.600]  against the fta which i prevailed each time alex um it was me and four other people actually sued
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:32.000]  the fta to um force him to put folic acid in prenatal vitamins so that we could prevent
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:39.200]  spina bifida and hydrocephalus and hydroencephalus seals many other birth defects and um we were
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:46.160]  prevailed in federal court and then they began to put folic acid in the um prenatal vitamins until
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:51.360]  then in 1947 we put folic acid in prenatal vitamins of animals but doctors were saying oh that's just
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:56.880]  an animals without people and um this is really horrible uh what happens i might want to throw
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:00.400]  a statistic at you this is from the center for decision control the federal agency that tracks
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:06.880]  this alex and it goes into the info wars um concerns about the government doing things
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:13.200]  to injure the american people each year in america this is from the cdc it came out february 5th
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:18.720]  2007 it was a full page newspaper story in the usa today full page story they said each year
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:23.360]  american medical doctors each year american medical doctors in their workplace hospitals and clinics
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:32.480]  kill and injure and infect 15 million americans two million in hospitals are infected 90 000 die
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:39.120]  from these infections um over a million are killed by doctors they don't even get an ocean ticket
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:43.520]  what would happen if i ran or iraq were to do that or if north korea were to do it with a biological
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:48.880]  weapon and infect two million people in large population center and killed 90 000 it'd be war
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:53.600]  well here's one trade that does it every year and nobody seems to mind because of the greater agenda
[01:25:53.600 --> 01:26:05.760]  as you point out okay what is the what is the greater agenda well you cannot help but look at
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:13.840]  all these statistics and see that um why can one trade kill injured in fact 15 million of their
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:18.400]  customers every year in the workplace don't even get an ocean ticket they have no oversight by any
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:26.000]  government agency they've been a a self-policing um monopoly for a hundred years since 1914
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:30.880]  and it's one of those crazy things that the government says well these guys must be doing
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:36.640]  something good um we're just gonna leave them run because they're doing you know they're kind of a
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:41.840]  an irregular militia doing what we want them to do we don't have to pay them uh it's kind of a
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:49.040]  crazy thing well um medical doctors make their money by defrauding the american public 85 percent
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:52.960]  of all personal bankruptcies are due to medical costs each year and this is from the institute
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:27:00.720]  of medicine the ethics watchdog for the medical trade um this came out in um let's see here oh
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:07.280]  in september 7th uh 2012 full page story in every newspaper in america they said each year in america
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:13.360]  medical doctors um fraudulently bill 30 cents out of every dollar to insurance companies and
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:21.120]  patients for their services this amounts to 750 billion dollars a year 750 billion dollars a year
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:26.560]  is uh that's three quarters of a trillion one third of the medical budget is fraudulent billing
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:31.600]  bernie madeoff went to jail for life plus 150 years for defrauding his investors at three billion
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:37.120]  here's one trade that does 750 billion yearly year after year after year and nobody does
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:42.480]  anything to them so we as the american people have to do what we did in the days we were fighting
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:46.880]  king george in england we have to use a different service we stop using t because he wouldn't let
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:51.200]  us have representation in england we went to coffee we're going to have to begin to do these
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:56.400]  things ourselves and this was the purpose absolutely let's play doctor well dr joel walloch
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:02.640]  is our guest and if you just tuned in this is earth shaking information again the pediatric
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:09.200]  cancers are up over 10 000 percent diabetes up over 3000 type two i know so many parents that
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:15.360]  got vaccines the last year and suddenly they're two three four year olds uh have failure uh in
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:20.880]  their pancreas from pancreatitis they go to the doctor and they say oh you've now got type one
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:26.000]  from your genetics even though their families don't have it they're covering that up uh that the
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.480]  vaccines are triggering some type of problem in the pancreas and then i read the inserts of the
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:36.720]  mmr shot and it says may give you pancreatitis and may give you diabetes what about that dr walloch
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:43.280]  well again they always look at um and this is criminal you point out very clearly alex you're
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:48.480]  quite correct this is criminal because they say well you have to weigh um the benefits of the
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:55.680]  greater good versus the perhaps harm uh to the individual and so seriously um everything that
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:29:02.480]  the FDA approves has one of the major side effects is death the only everything that the FDA approves of
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:08.480]  has a major side effect of death everything think of how many drugs you've seen over the years then
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:12.880]  an FDA approved within a year or two they're getting recalled because of a high death rate well
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:16.320]  they knew that before they approved it put on the market and they give them a slap on the wrist
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:22.800]  exactly and of course these drugs are all designed to treat symptoms none were designed to cure anything
[01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:28.080]  or nutrients as you pointed out quite clearly was curvy cure things let's just take congestive
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:32.000]  heart failure the most common cause of heart failure dr walloch i want to walk through all this
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:37.600]  and tie in to angelina joe lee on the other side of this break i want to talk about hydrofluorosalistic
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:43.840]  acid and more dr joel walloch a literal icon who helped defeat the FDA and save the nutrient
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:48.880]  nutraceutical industry over and over again we all owe him a debt of gratitude the man is a legend
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:56.000]  when you actually know the facts the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:25.920]  dr joel wallach is our guest a syndicated host of dead doctors don't lie on over
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:29.840]  300 stations last time i checked around the country best-selling author of the new book
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:35.200]  epigenetics the death of the genetic theory and disease my dad's got a degree in the dental
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:41.840]  surgery oral surgery and also in chemistry and he was just blown away by how technical it was
[01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:47.200]  and how accurate because my dad also worked at md anderson and cancer research for about five years
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:55.600]  off and on he also worked in assisting when he was still a dentist but but younger on eye surgery
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:59.600]  and things like that and he just thinks it's an amazing book and he's a pretty smart fellow
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:03.680]  but who's really smart are the medical doctors and scientists that are also in the book
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:09.200]  and the studies and what they show and this really overthrows the genetic theory of disease
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:13.840]  transmission i mean yeah if you're predisposed to get lung cancer when you're 100 years old
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:18.000]  you might get it but you're going to get it when you're 45 if you smoke cigarettes because the toxins
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.880]  in there are going to mutate and you know screw up the cells but if you've got the nutrients you
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:27.520]  need you probably might get it just a layman statement here when you're 75 you would have died
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:33.600]  when you were 100 but you smoked the cigarettes but you got the nutrients so 75 you don't get the
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:38.880]  nutrients i mean you might get cancer when you're 30 i mean it's real simple folks you don't get
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:46.640]  vitamin c you die your teeth fall out your skin breaks open i see all these old people that you
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:52.560]  know drink diet coke and eat crap tv dinners with no food in it they don't eat citrus they don't get
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:57.760]  minerals you see all people with scurvy their teeth are falling out there's blood in their eyes or
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:02.800]  their the skin ted anderson's dad basically had scurvy and he lets me tell the story i feel disrespectful
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:08.080]  telling it but ted lets me tell it in fact wants me to he did beyond tangy tangerine for about four
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:12.880]  months had Alzheimer's couldn't even go fishing anymore didn't know who he was got on beyond
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:18.320]  tangy tangerine 2.0 and a bunch of the other stuff at info wars life dot com enforce store
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:23.280]  dot com links to info wars health dot com and the main site to go to is in force team dot com
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:27.280]  to get the beyond tangy tangerine and but we ought to drag ted in and he's at the network
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:30.240]  today i don't even know if he's up there in minnesota but if he's around john see he's there
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:35.520]  and drag him in here to get on the the studio and people know i do this impromptu this isn't staged
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:39.520]  so harm and let me know of ted's there because i hate talking about his dad but
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:45.200]  his his arms were opening up he had sores on him uh i'd been up there to minnesota and met him
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:49.200]  and ted got him on this one that a few months he knew who he was again
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:55.360]  he was fishing his short term and long term memory were back and then the doctor said what's
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:36:00.240]  going on your blood's got high k and we give you cumulon so you don't have a stroke never had a stroke
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:05.920]  they give him cumulon to fit in the blood and ordered him off of it and his mother ted's mother
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:10.960]  sweetheart so i feel disrespectful about his mother but he says tell it he's mad about it ted's mother
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:16.960]  in charge said you will not get that beyond tangy tangerine 2.0 anymore you will not get
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:20.640]  the other things and within a month he went back to not knowing who he was and the sores all opened
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:26.000]  up i mean wallach there's a real story of the owner of this network i've known for 20 years
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:31.360]  he was a sponsor for two years before he started the network ted anderson and these doctors are god
[01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:36.400]  and his mother and i don't mean to be mean it's just true would follow those orders
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:42.400]  that is incredible dr wallach well you're exactly right alex and this used to be the way it was in
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:50.240]  the days of king george uh and uh no taxation without representation and so my view is if
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:54.320]  we're to survive what's going on between the doctors and the patients and the government
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:59.200]  and the citizens we have to take over i'm not talking about a shooting war but what we have
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:06.240]  to do at least initially is to um take over our health care and do our own laboratory test we
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:11.040]  actually have a book called let's play doctor teaches people in this in the chapter on uh laboratory
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:16.320]  home laboratory you can go to a pharmacy alex without a prescription you get all the same
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:19.920]  test strips your doctor will use in a physical in his office he'll charge you two thousand
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:25.360]  dollars for that physical you get the same test strips uh buck fifty a piece and you're looking
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:29.600]  at uh four dollars and fifty cents for complete physical instead of two thousand dollars you
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:35.120]  can do yourself we should add how old you are you look like in person like you're about 55
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:39.680]  your skin's glowing how old are you dr wallach and two months i'll be 76
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:46.240]  incredible i didn't mean to interrupt but please that's right how can you say
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:51.440]  someone shouldn't have vitamin k you'll die without it sorry go ahead yeah no um yeah
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:56.720]  vitamin k is absolutely necessary for life for everything from a proper blood clotting to bone
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:04.880]  health and um you know is doctors very well silly is the kind way to say it um that's why the title
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:09.280]  of my cd and my book dead doctors don't lie it's the only time the doctors won't lie is when they're
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:16.160]  dead and what i need to do is make sure that everybody knows they can do their own lab work
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:20.400]  for four dollars and fifty cents that includes the equivalent of a colonoscopic exam the book
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:24.640]  let's play doctor teaches you how to do all these things uh you go to pharmacy without a prescription
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:27.840]  get all the same test strip your doctor's use do your own blood pressure do your own weight
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:31.840]  and um we don't need the doctors anymore except you get run over by a truck
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:39.040]  by the way dr wallach we were able to drag ted Anderson in he probably ran across the
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:43.440]  building and probably breathing heavy ted anderson owner of the gc and radio network
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:47.280]  syndicate and over fourteen hundred affiliates with all of his stations third largest radio
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:51.360]  network in the u.s and ted i always feel disrespectful telling the story about your dad
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:55.760]  i haven't checked in on him in about a year i haven't been up there i should have uh i i just
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:01.280]  told the story i don't know if you heard that uh but uh to give people your brief testimony
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:04.880]  about what beyond tangy tangerine the engemi products did for your dad and then
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:09.840]  what the medical doctor said well i mean here's what here's what we're uh dealing with here with
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:15.360]  poor guy was being rushed to the veterans hospital once every four to six days because
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:20.960]  he had run low on electrolytes and uh we got him on the beyond tangy tangerine i mean this went on
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:26.800]  about five or six times uh and we got him on the beyond tangy tangerine and it stopped he hadn't
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:32.560]  had to be brought back to the hospital since uh he is suffering with dementia but if he does not
[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:36.960]  get his electrolytes it's like the man is gone you give him his electrolytes and he remembers
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:44.320]  who you are and uh he's smiling he's happy he has energy uh you know that's just the uh you know
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:49.360]  the man is aging in the process i can't get him off the stand drugs because the doctors insist
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:54.320]  that he have to have to have to have to have them and it's not my choice but i can tell you right
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:59.600]  now alex he is so much better because he's on the engemi products it's not even okay because a
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:04.080]  couple years ago the doctor had ordered him off i guess he got a different doctor or correct me and
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:09.600]  then and the symptoms really came back big time um was i telling that story accurately ted no you
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:13.920]  definitely were as a matter of fact it's because they had him on kumadin and when when he went into
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:19.360]  the doctor his levels went off and uh they took him off the beyond tangy tangerine because they
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:24.080]  wanted to keep him on the kumadin for blood thinning finally we got him off the kumadin and
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:29.680]  that that's that was back a few years ago and that's when he was being rushed into the hospital
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:33.760]  and he had this problem where he would his electrolytes would drop they'd have to put on
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:38.080]  them put him on an iv he would come back again we'd be able to bring him back home but within
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:43.600]  about four days later the electrolytes would drop again back to the hospital back on the iv
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:49.280]  and then of course his heart was having afib problems too and so when you when you put him
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:55.840]  on the healthy the healthy start pack along with the uh the glycosamine it helps the discs between
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:41:01.280]  the vertebrae uh puff up and it helps the heart be properly you get them the uh the beyond tangy
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:05.760]  tangerine and all of a sudden the afib is not a problem anymore at least that was the experience
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:10.160]  with my father absolutely thank you ted aanderson and you were speaking of hearts before the break
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:14.960]  and we need to get back into that dr walloch but this is what we're dealing with here um
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:20.560]  um where these doctors literally don't want people on vitamins and nutrients and things
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:27.360]  it is just so incredibly obvious that we've absolutely uh have to have these uh dr walloch
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:32.560]  you were you were getting into the heart uh before he went to break literally literally and
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:37.360]  figurably this is the heart of the problem very good example a congestive heart failure the most
[01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:42.240]  common cause of heart death and adults united states is actually the terminal event for berry
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:46.880]  berry uh which is a deficiency of a single vitamin give all 90 cents of nutrients with
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:50.640]  an extra amount of that single vitamin i get people off the heart transplant list been on
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:56.240]  there for three years on 27 prescription drugs and we just dozens and dozens of times a year we
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:42:00.320]  know it should be thousands but so many people are frightened and they stay with their doctor
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:05.040]  and they're prepared to die and suffer to make sure their doctor gets paid instead of trying
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:09.280]  something else they'll try uh five bids on a roof at a house or a sprinkler system but they
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:14.160]  stick with the same doctor whatever the doctor says they do and uh this is a matter of marketing
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:19.840]  and the doctor is behind you know what doctor blalock top brain surgeon introduced the terms
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:24.960]  excitotoxin and scores of other to literature that is now seen as prestigious because he did it 30
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:30.880]  years ago 20 years ago 10 years ago and it's now accepted he explains that you have chronically
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:41.680]  inflamed brains from vaccines gmo's uh the the mercury the uh msg all of it and that yeah somebody
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:46.480]  can go too far in his words where it's just it's just it there's so many holes in your brain but
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:52.160]  basically that you're gone but if you do it early enough and even until pretty late that it is a
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:56.800]  lack of vitamins nutrients and he described statin drugs now get my dad's a chemist my dad
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:02.720]  would say this 20 years ago he'd get mad when he saw statin ads but he's not a md like blalock and a
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:09.040]  brain expert blalock said that it your brain is made up as you know wallach dr wallach of cholesterol
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:14.640]  and that statin drugs literally eat your brain and so we wonder why there's an epidemic of all
[01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:20.720]  timers well it's the mercury and it's the aluminum but it's it's also the statin drugs and we've got
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:25.600]  studies on that but they push them now they want to put statins quote in the water supply
[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:31.680]  folks won't believe that put it into google dr wallach speak about statins okay well statin
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:36.720]  drugs of course are the cause of alzheimer disease alzheimer disease did not exist even by another
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:45.120]  name alex uh 45 years ago uh today's number four killer battles over the age of 64 and it's caused
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:48.720]  by going away the mile and the white matter of the brain resulting in the naked nerve fibers
[01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:53.840]  tangling up nerve tangles which are the classic feature of alzheimer disease they shard circuit
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:58.480]  you get alzheimer disease you get a little bit of violent behavior your cognition your
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:04.080]  ability to solve problems goes away your memory goes away and it's all because when you get on
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:09.120]  statin drugs it lowers your blood cholesterol of course that's the that's the use of it for for
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:15.200]  cardiovascular disease and it turns out that 75 of your brain weight is made up of this mile and
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:20.240]  this white matter of the brain which is 100 cholesterol and then they put you on a cholesterol
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:25.840]  restricted diets and they created alzheimer disease low t uh erectile dysfunction menopausal
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:34.000]  symptoms and basically people need to eat anywhere from 12 15 20 25 eggs a day and they'll prevent
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:38.720]  and get rid of alzheimer disease okay they can't be fried they have to be poached with a soft yoke
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:45.200]  or a soft scrambling butter not in oils take the 90 cents of nutrients eat your 8 10 12 i i just had
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:49.120]  four poached shakes for breakfast this morning after my meeting tonight i'll have four poached
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:55.120]  shakes again i'll have eight poached eggs today along with a nice big steak and it's imperative
[01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:59.200]  keep well i'll tell you since i started doing what you said three years ago because at first
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:02.960]  with young jeffrey i knew it was good products but i just never took vitamins couldn't make myself
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:07.680]  do any of it since i started doing everything in infowarshealth.com that you recommend with the
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:15.840]  videos there to train people i've lost more than 50 pounds i got up to 279 uh and i have so much more
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:21.200]  energy my skin looks better my stamina just everything and that's what i had this morning
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:28.960]  was four poached eggs uh and spinach uh and that's basically what i eat is fish red meat
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:34.880]  and eggs and then raw salad and other vegetables and i just feel like i'm 20 years old i mean i feel
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:40.000]  like i'm ready to tear people's arms off it's just amazing i'm glad you remember the club
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:47.840]  it's um yeah absolutely and of course um we have documented in the book epigenetics as you point out
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:54.080]  all the double blind research projects that were done to prevent and reverse
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:57.440]  Alzheimer's disease we know how to prevent Alzheimer's disease we know how to reverse it
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:03.520]  i've reversed diagnosed Alzheimer's disease by four um neurological clinics the university in
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:09.360]  north carolina and uh in five days time this guy gets up gets dressed walks out of the nursing
[01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:15.040]  home he was he was uh um in a coma ready to die five days later he gets up gets dressed goes back
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:19.840]  to work that was five years ago he's still going and no Alzheimer's disease anymore
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:26.800]  talk a little bit about the Rockefellers and how they took over the different branches of
[01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:33.120]  medicine in the last hundred years okay well that all started about 1912 the Rockefeller Institute
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:38.320]  in the Carnegie Institute you know the steel guys um the usual suspects they're the one financing
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:43.920]  riots against the police right now yep exactly the same bunch uh they actually hired a retired
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:50.400]  university president uh got the name of flexor and flexor was to do a report and look at the top
[01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:58.080]  130 medical schools in america and find out which one of them which one of them are thems i suppose
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:04.160]  if you're from the south they would um they would and i'm from the south so i can say that
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:08.720]  but anyway um they were looking for the medical schools who had trained about medical students
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:13.360]  on pharmaceuticals instead of herbs and homeopathy and nutrition they found 30 of them out of the top
[01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:20.320]  130 and they began to give them money for to hire the best professors the best equipment they gave
[01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:24.000]  grants to medical students to go there so all the other medical schools sort of died on the
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:28.240]  vine not because they attacked them directly they just died on the vine for lack of funding
[01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:32.560]  compared with the medical schools were using pharmaceuticals and of course Rockefellers and
[01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:37.280]  the carnagees began to buy up all these pharmaceutical companies and start new companies and and
[01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:45.040]  give patents for drugs and all that kind of stuff well it turns out that um uh at the same time uh
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:50.480]  through giving money under the table to the elected officials at the national the state
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:55.200]  the county and the city levels they wrote to make the medical profession a protected monopoly
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:48:00.320]  self-policing with no oversight by any other agency then along came insurance that was the
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:05.600]  death knell of americans was the insurance thing because people would say well i don't care if you
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:12.880]  can help me for three bucks a day because i can get my leg cut off for nothing through insurance
[01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:16.320]  and so that always take the more drastic treatment because insurance would pay for it rather than the
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:20.560]  one that would save their lives sure and if you go back until about a hundred years ago only elitists
[01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:25.440]  could go to medical doctors in most cases so it was seen as a status thing so you have the sycophantic
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:30.960]  worship of mds and mds great if i got a hernia or a broken leg or a gunshot wound a lot of them are
[01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:36.080]  great people and know this information but under obama care they're now centralizing everything
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:40.800]  where the mds will now be total slaves of the computers it's come out that the veterans are on
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:45.520]  don't treat list and i think that's why alternative medicine and stuff is exploding right now is the
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:50.880]  pressure of the medical system collapsing into total corruption and any good parts of it basically
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:58.800]  dying is forcing people to alternatives briefly dr wallick speak about the alex pack that we call it

[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:12.720]  heart your pancreas uh your your thyroid i mean black people it's a death sentence nobody's going
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:16.160]  to tell them from their community because they're all bought and paid for i mean you know so they're
[01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:21.920]  going to have some you know lawyers stirring up trouble and it was all over the news how dare
[01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:28.000]  these whites put that on their things this is all made up there's so such little racism by whites
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:33.600]  most whites are these politically correct knee knocking totally there there's not racism this
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:38.800]  political correctness makes white people feel guilty and scared i mean i'll be a politically

[01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:07.120]  just whites are so uncomfortable and so meanwhile the democrats are running around putting up signs
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:10.800]  everywhere saying go after blacks when they actually want to abort all the black people
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:17.280]  they're the real racist in my view info wars dot com has the story uh dr joel wallach we're going to
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:20.800]  hold us a little bit over if you can do it if you got a jump i understand oh you're a busy man but
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:26.080]  what do you make of angeline and joe lee uh having her ovaries removed again saying because she's

[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:35.680]  going and having this done now well i appreciated uh when you introduced that at the beginning of
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:40.560]  your show today you said well next thing is she'll have her brain taken out to avoid brain cancer
[01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:46.400]  yes and then i've been saying the same thing for years and uh basically that's where i heard it i
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:53.840]  listened to your show okay well basically um this is a thing where the medical doctors are using
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:58:00.960]  people's fears to just get work and um it's a tragic thing uh and absolutely uh if you look at the
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:06.720]  title of the the subtitle of the book epigenetics the death of the genetic 30z transmission there
[01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:11.600]  are no genetically transmitted diseases uh your genes let's say you have the potential to live

[02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:48.240]  over you you've got the floor for the rest of the short segment and a little bit into the next
[02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:53.200]  please continue with your breakdown of angeline and joe lee uh you know because her mother had
[02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:57.120]  cancer and the rest of it first it's her breast then her ovaries that's what i said last year
[02:00:57.120 --> 02:01:02.320]  when she had her breast removed will she remove all sexual tissue next i mean it's it's just it's
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:07.200]  just because you know that that's where she has the quote predistribution i mean what should she
[02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:14.160]  do instead of removing her ovaries well there's two things that cause cancer alex uh number one
[02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:21.520]  is that people eat the bad stuff that create and initiate and stimulate the genesis or the the um
[02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:27.200]  cause of cancer and then they eat bad things that drive it faster and they don't take the 90th
[02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:31.680]  century nutrients which will support their immune system to protect them from cancer for
[02:01:31.680 --> 02:01:36.480]  instance there's a wonderful study that came out in 1998 by the university of south carolina
[02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:41.440]  big big study and all they did was look at the way that women cooked their food and women who ate
[02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:48.720]  their meat cooked well done is very well done where the fat was burnt and crunchy and it's tasty
[02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:54.320]  people like that it increased the risk of breast cancer by 462 percent if they cooked their meat
[02:01:54.320 --> 02:02:01.840]  medium rare to reduce the risk of breast cancer by 462 percent and then when you look at supplementation
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:08.160]  in certain minerals Dr. Gerhard Schrauser who's one of the third authors of the book heavy genetics
[02:02:08.160 --> 02:02:14.480]  a great guy he discovered the essentiality of vitamin excuse me of the mineral selenium and he
[02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:22.320]  did a wonderful study on selenium and um breast cancer and he came out and said hey all cancers
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:26.640]  you're going to reduce your risk of prostate cancer colon cancer breast cancer by 82 percent
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:31.440]  by supplementing with 200 micrograms of selenium every day and so between supplementing with
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:39.440]  antioxidants of things like resveratrol, quercetin, turmeric, vitamin c, vitamin a, beta carotene and
[02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:46.160]  then you throw in minerals like gallium to prevent brain cancer enormous numbers of studies
[02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:50.560]  in england that had very large amounts of brain cancer in children they supplemented the pregnant
[02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:55.920]  women with gallium and they didn't get brain cancer the kids anymore big stuff and all this is in
[02:02:55.920 --> 02:03:02.400]  the book heavy genetics and so all these things where they farm these these groups where they raise
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:06.480]  money for the research to find the gene that's absolutely fraudulent stuff because there's
[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:13.520]  not a single gene that actually causes any disease the genes are a potential for health up to 200
[02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:19.120]  maybe beyond 200 years you give your genes your DNA your RNA and your telomeres a little n caps
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:23.600]  in your chromosome everything they need the 90th century nutrients you're going to maximize your
[02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:27.840]  genetic potential for longevity and for health and fending off disease but if you live on these
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:33.520]  diet drinks and eat a lot of sugar and eat a lot of fried foods that's where there's no pastors
[02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:39.600]  who tend to be very religious or truthfully very religious people they love god and they all
[02:03:39.600 --> 02:03:44.400]  died in their 60s 70s and 80s because everybody because they love them so much give them fried
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:49.280]  chicken after church every sunday and that's what kills them and if they would avoid the fried chicken
[02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:53.600]  and take the alex pack every day we'd have pastors living to be beyond 100 which is the way it's
[02:03:53.600 --> 02:04:00.320]  supposed to be it's just that simple in the animal industry we've eliminated 900 different diseases
[02:04:00.320 --> 02:04:06.960]  using these 90th century nutrients that still plague people in 2012 there was a wonderful study
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:11.600]  in food chemistry a very well respected scientific journal where they normally look at the nutritional
[02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:16.160]  value of our foods plus the pollutant loads in foods i read it every month and that particular
[02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:22.880]  issue april 16th 2012 they said commercially available baby foods like simulac um things like
[02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:28.480]  gerber's infamil others have less than 20 percent is required minerals and vitamins for kids well
[02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:32.400]  that's why our kids are going to die before us aren't children our cues are dropping and why
[02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:37.440]  they're so stupid and why the cancer is exploding and all the studies you mentioned are in the book
[02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:41.680]  they spent all over the news that if you burn your meat it's going to give you colon cancer
[02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:46.240]  breast cancer but people just don't want to listen everybody should go to info wars store

[02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:26.640]  we've got to change our lives change other people's lives we've got to demonstrate as we're doing
[02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:32.000]  the truth with simple things like if you eat processed meat or heavily cooked meat as you
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:38.480]  said 500 plus percent increase in breast cancer or colon cancer major studies that is just we're
[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:42.080]  going to continue to put that information out to people doesn't matter what the government says
[02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:48.480]  we appreciate you for that alex you're definitely the warrior that's to get the
[02:12:48.480 --> 02:12:53.040]  information out and we can't thank you enough uh we have to save our kids because they are our
[02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:57.840]  future they're the future of america and right now experts are telling us and i believe this
[02:12:57.840 --> 02:13:02.880]  that um if we don't do something about it uh our kids will be the first generation who do not live
[02:13:02.880 --> 02:13:07.120]  as long as their parents in america 50 percent of americans will be burying their children it's just
[02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:11.120]  outrageous we're supposed to have the best medical system the world know we have the worst we have the
[02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:15.360]  most expensive but not the best and to save our kids we've got to get them on the 90th century
[02:13:15.360 --> 02:13:19.840]  nutrients and before they're conceived alter the pregnancy they're developed in from the moment
[02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:23.200]  they're born so when they get old enough to have their own kids they will be steeped in
[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:26.880]  these 90th century nutrients prevent every birth defect you can name and 10 times that many you
[02:13:26.880 --> 02:13:31.200]  can and we're talking about everything we're talking about spina bifida we're talking about
[02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:36.400]  cerebral palsy we're talking about heart defects cleft palate cleft lip cystic fibrosis musculitis
[02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:46.400]  fee we're talking about uh things like um uh okay and so we're talking about um every
[02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:52.400]  birth defect you can name including transgender kids these are these are actually made at the third
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:57.280]  to seventh week of pregnancy because the mother's missing nutrients and this is preventable
[02:13:57.840 --> 02:14:02.640]  transgender kids or or something we you got to love them or their app but we don't necessarily
[02:14:02.640 --> 02:14:07.920]  have to have any more transgender kids born okay and this is something when somebody gets married
[02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:11.520]  instead of giving them a set of towels with their monogram on it you give them all 90
[02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:16.000]  cents of nutrients they get engaged you give them all 90 cents of nutrients instead of a set of linens
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:20.960]  and we will save america so extreme next you're going to say that humans need oxygen and that
[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:26.880]  plants need carbon dioxide i mean you're saying we need vitamin c and vitamin d and iodine you're
[02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:33.520]  saying that we need selenium you're i mean this is you well it's like saying fish need water
[02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:40.080]  to live in that is extreme well that's so bizarre that you would teach something alternative to the
[02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:45.680]  government you're just an extremist well just to kind of end it up in a sense or two um doing
[02:14:45.680 --> 02:14:49.280]  what we're doing and just eating well trying to get everything we need would be the same thing as
[02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:54.720]  putting texas dirt into your car put six quarts of texas dirt in your car instead of oil and you
[02:14:54.720 --> 02:14:59.760]  say well there's probably some oil in there because it's texas dirt and that's how insane it is to
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:03.360]  just eat well and expect to get everything you need ask steve jobs how that worked for him he died
[02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:09.440]  of 56 because he ate well cooked everything in extra extra extra virgin virgin olive oil and
[02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:14.480]  he died of a cancer that's produced by his diet his chef killed him as sure as he shot him in the
[02:15:14.480 --> 02:15:22.640]  head break down briefly that diet well the diet is no bad stuff no fried foods no processed
[02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:27.200]  meats with nitrates nitrites no oils including olive oil and coconut oil absolutely no gluten
[02:15:27.200 --> 02:15:32.160]  no wheat brought around oats and then you have to supplement with the 90s antigens there's zones
[02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:37.680]  in on earth there's 20 places on earth where people have them naturally in the soil and they're still
[02:15:37.680 --> 02:15:40.960]  burning wood and taking the wood ashes and putting them in their garden so they're getting those
[02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:46.800]  minerals recycled that ended for us and here in america at three o'clock in the afternoon monday
[02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:50.880]  september 4th 1882 when thomas set us and pulled the switch on the first commercial
[02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:55.200]  electric generating plant everybody flipped over to electricity stopped burning wood we had no more
[02:15:55.200 --> 02:16:00.640]  wood ashes to put in our garden and that was at the beginning of the end in 1936 u.s senate document
[02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:06.240]  264 came out u.s senate document 264 came out and said there's no longer enough nutritional

[02:33:18.800 --> 02:33:23.280]  going to be part of their job they claim that the irs has an investigation going on you not an
[02:33:23.280 --> 02:33:27.680]  indictment not a criminal investigation just has your name in a file you won't be able to fly out
[02:33:27.680 --> 02:33:32.640]  of the country now they're talking about if you haven't had vaccines you can't fly it's all outside
[02:33:32.640 --> 02:33:37.200]  of law and the new york times comes out and says yeah they take old ladies money with no criminal
[02:33:37.200 --> 02:33:42.320]  records and even after tax money the irs just takes their counts tens of thousands of people a year
[02:33:43.200 --> 02:33:49.440]  and now the feds are giving speeches assistant attorney general leslie cadwell gave a speech
[02:33:49.440 --> 02:33:53.920]  when she urged banks to alert law enforcement authorities about a problem this is a quote so
[02:33:53.920 --> 02:33:58.320]  that police can quote seize the funds or at least initiate an investigation so the cops pull you
[02:33:58.320 --> 02:34:02.160]  over just grab the money out of your car and then the feds get 20 percent of it locals get 80
[02:34:02.160 --> 02:34:07.760]  percent that's federalization as black highlights according to the handbook for the federal financial
[02:34:07.760 --> 02:34:12.560]  institution examination council such suspicious activity includes transactions conducted are
[02:34:12.560 --> 02:34:18.160]  attempted by at the bank or an affiliate and aggregating five thousand or more people think
[02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:23.040]  it's still 10 so they get under that like like like they're like they're trying to hide when you're
[02:34:23.040 --> 02:34:27.920]  doing nothing wrong you'd be insane not to have five ten percent of your cash you know in a safe
[02:34:27.920 --> 02:34:32.960]  or something black provides a chilling scenario under which an attempt to withdraw your own money
[02:34:32.960 --> 02:34:38.160]  from your bank account could end with a home visit from the cops and they go through it how
[02:34:38.160 --> 02:34:45.360]  they're doing it and again under asset for which your seizure and the drug laws you see this cases
[02:34:45.360 --> 02:34:50.000]  where the cops pull you over this usually really corrupt jurisdictions that fully do this and it
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:53.120]  will be an old lady and they'll say what's in your purse and they'll see two thousand dollars no
[02:34:53.120 --> 02:34:57.680]  old ladies carry a lot of cash because they're smart from the depression and they'll just take it
[02:34:57.680 --> 02:35:01.360]  say if you don't like it they'll see the judge the judge will say we're going to test that man this
[02:35:01.360 --> 02:35:06.160]  has come out on the news hundreds of times we find any drug residue we're going to take your card
[02:35:06.160 --> 02:35:10.720]  and got you because the federal law says we can't which it really doesn't but they misinterpret
[02:35:10.720 --> 02:35:16.480]  and have kept juries that'll do it and a lot of times they say okay go ahead and do it then they'll
[02:35:16.480 --> 02:35:20.720]  test the money and of course almost all money has some drug residues on it they'll say all right
[02:35:20.720 --> 02:35:27.600]  we're inviting you my cousins are all on a jury and that's what goes on from upstate new york to
[02:35:27.600 --> 02:35:34.240]  east texas and those are the bad cops and the feds wrote it all they did it all it is beyond
[02:35:34.240 --> 02:35:40.080]  boss hog and roscoe pico train those are angels compared to this and then the big banks pull up
[02:35:40.080 --> 02:35:47.040]  bloomberg uh 378 billion uh wells fargo wicovia laundered drug money didn't even get in trouble
[02:35:47.040 --> 02:35:53.840]  from 2005 to 2008 when they got quote caught i mean the they were leasing and running the drug
[02:35:53.840 --> 02:35:57.360]  aircraft you know the cops will be out here looking for drugs on the street when the big
[02:35:57.360 --> 02:36:02.320]  banks are laundering the money by the trillions every decade 500 billion dollars a year in drug
[02:36:02.320 --> 02:36:07.040]  money in the u.s alone our troops loaded on the c 130s and fly it here when they couldn't hide it
[02:36:07.040 --> 02:36:11.520]  anymore they just put it on the news going back to Gerald salente this is about social control
[02:36:12.080 --> 02:36:16.240]  whether people believe in the bible or not it's the same thing where everything's tracked everything's
[02:36:16.240 --> 02:36:20.960]  traced everything's looked at by the nsa all these other agencies they follow everything you do
[02:36:21.680 --> 02:36:25.680]  they built backdoors into everything letting the hackers get into the backdoors and create
[02:36:25.680 --> 02:36:30.720]  all the financial crises we see with credit cards getting canceled every few weeks now
[02:36:30.720 --> 02:36:37.200]  and debit cards so cashless is a disaster and then if we want to have cash because it's fun to give
[02:36:37.200 --> 02:36:43.280]  somebody a tip and cash or fun to you know give bonuses and cash at christmas i'm supposedly dirty
[02:36:43.280 --> 02:36:49.360]  to take after tax money and give it to people i mean this is so sick we live in a prison in this
[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:54.720]  country it's like form saying the war on eliminate stands they don't want barter they don't want
[02:36:54.720 --> 02:37:02.080]  grassroots what's really behind it gerald salente i believe that this latest issue about notifying
[02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:09.840]  the police with withdrawals is fear of a banking crisis and that's why i was relating to you what
[02:37:09.840 --> 02:37:16.080]  has happened to me in the past they cannot afford to run on the banks because there is no dough in
[02:37:16.080 --> 02:37:24.160]  the banks to really cover this you look what happened alex at the end of 2014 when all of a
[02:37:24.160 --> 02:37:35.680]  sudden jamie legs diamond over there from the jp morgan chase gang actually gave congress the language
[02:37:35.680 --> 02:37:45.280]  to put in about credit to swap the false swaps to be part of the balance sheets in banks so essentially
[02:37:45.280 --> 02:37:52.720]  all these trillions in derivatives and credit to false swaps that the banks are gambling with
[02:37:52.720 --> 02:38:02.320]  now they're covered by supposedly fdic and then you add on top of that the legislation with the
[02:38:02.320 --> 02:38:14.160]  bail ins that allows the banks to grab your dough if it can't be covered by insurance i believe that
[02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:22.640]  this is being done to dissuade people from taking their money out of banks and to penalize them
[02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:30.400]  when they do because i believe there's going and you know it's not only me it's dr paul kreg robert
[02:38:30.400 --> 02:38:35.280]  well we've seen the bail ins uh in cyprus other areas this is the globalist model everywhere
[02:38:35.280 --> 02:38:39.840]  else they've been i mean obama's talking about tax increases by executive order totally illegal
[02:38:39.840 --> 02:38:44.880]  they're talking about grabbing education funds calling them a trust funds i mean they are really
[02:38:44.880 --> 02:38:52.320]  gearing up gerald exactly and again you you look at david stockman's work all of us we're all saying
[02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:59.520]  that this ponzi scheme is going to collapse you see what happens alex even when they hint about
[02:38:59.520 --> 02:39:06.240]  raising interest rates the market goes into panic because the low interest rates have allowed
[02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:13.200]  these this this ponzi scheme to continue to go and now they're doing it of course over in europe
[02:39:13.200 --> 02:39:19.200]  with with their quantitative easing and over there you know it's one country after another
[02:39:19.200 --> 02:39:26.160]  so what we're saying is this is going to collapse when it collapses there's going to be panicked
[02:39:26.160 --> 02:39:31.440]  when there's panic people will go to the banks that's right when they go to the banks they're
[02:39:31.440 --> 02:39:36.560]  going to get nothing well it's clear that we've got a lot of special interests that are out of
[02:39:36.560 --> 02:39:41.280]  control and i've studied history elites always think they're invincible the white shoe boys that
[02:39:41.280 --> 02:39:46.240]  you call them the the the the harvard gang there's no way they're going to get away with this i mean
[02:39:46.240 --> 02:39:51.760]  they're even training gerald to have the military takeover domestically as you know and admitting it
[02:39:52.480 --> 02:39:56.640]  but the military is getting screwed over worse than anybody i mean who would have the nerve to
[02:39:56.640 --> 02:40:04.000]  put even young men and women with treatable diseases on do not treat list at the v a i mean
[02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:09.200]  they they are our government is so illegitimate gerald where do you see all this going i mean
[02:40:09.200 --> 02:40:16.160]  washington is so blackmailed congress you know wouldn't even stop the fcc grabbing the u-turn
[02:40:16.160 --> 02:40:20.720]  the internet uh they're just obama's dissolve the borders they're about to sign the pacific
[02:40:20.720 --> 02:40:27.760]  partnership in secret i mean we are living in just a crazy time where is it all going again you
[02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:33.600]  know we're looking at a collapse and it's not only in the united states look what's going on around
[02:40:33.600 --> 02:40:40.800]  the world whether it's the pedamus party in spain whether it's ukip in the uk lapen's party got
[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:46.720]  what 25 percent of the vote you're going to start seeing more and more revolution take place
[02:40:46.720 --> 02:40:52.560]  the people have had it you know the numbers what is it one percent according to ops fam
[02:40:52.560 --> 02:40:58.880]  is going to control 99 percent of all the money but i mean how can the elites then
[02:40:58.880 --> 02:41:02.960]  know that there's a class war against the middle class going on by the elite and then try to sick
[02:41:02.960 --> 02:41:08.560]  the giant underclass on the middle class and start a race war that's not that dog's not hunting
[02:41:08.560 --> 02:41:12.400]  clearly the democrats and george soros well they admit it's been released
[02:41:12.400 --> 02:41:16.560]  are spending hundreds of millions total and putting up fake stickers in austin's saying
[02:41:16.560 --> 02:41:20.880]  white only to get us all fighting with each other and divide and conquer journal i don't
[02:41:20.880 --> 02:41:27.920]  see washington's balkanization plan working well it's not going to and it's is going to be chaos
[02:41:27.920 --> 02:41:33.600]  and more mayhem there's absolutely no question about even have guys like this uh poll tutor
[02:41:33.600 --> 02:41:39.520]  jones one of the uh some name like that you know they always have these very important names like
[02:41:39.520 --> 02:41:45.840]  tutor and uh he's coming out big hedge fund guy warning about what's going to happen with
[02:41:45.840 --> 02:41:49.600]  the middle class dissolved and you know what tutor means that's that's british royalty a
[02:41:49.600 --> 02:41:54.080]  british house that fell hundreds of years ago but exactly you look at the elite in our country
[02:41:54.080 --> 02:41:57.680]  people always obsess over their ethnicity a lot of them are connected to british royalty
[02:41:57.680 --> 02:42:02.160]  and then you see our tabloids worshiping british royalty it's like a twilight zone episode Gerald
[02:42:02.160 --> 02:42:11.600]  Lee it is and it and it's exactly look alex the fish rots from the head down it's a truism
[02:42:12.160 --> 02:42:19.920]  we i've become a murderous criminal class run by two mafias i should say the bloods
[02:42:19.920 --> 02:42:25.520]  and the crypts the democrats and republicans how many more people do they have to murder
[02:42:25.520 --> 02:42:32.480]  in the name of tube uh the name of freedom and democracy and how much more of our money do they
[02:42:32.480 --> 02:42:37.600]  have to steal in the name of too big to fail and they've maneuvered us into total bankruptcy
[02:42:37.600 --> 02:42:42.560]  they're they're they're trying to hurt the dollar long term what do you think their exit strategy is
[02:42:42.560 --> 02:42:47.120]  i mean do they have a method to their madness because i see the london guardian others reporting
[02:42:47.120 --> 02:42:51.760]  on what we've said forever they're building secret underground bunkers and castles in the
[02:42:51.760 --> 02:42:57.120]  ozarks they're they're building landing strips in new zeal in the middle of nowhere and putting in
[02:42:57.120 --> 02:43:02.880]  guardhouses with up to 20 armed you know mercenaries that they give endowments to live with them for
[02:43:02.880 --> 02:43:06.640]  life i mean the elite have been really good at screwing everybody over but now they're gonna
[02:43:06.640 --> 02:43:11.280]  have to live in armored fortresses that's the scariest part for me is that the elite are digging
[02:43:11.280 --> 02:43:18.960]  in Gerald they don't have a clue what to do it's out of their control it's out of control it is spun
[02:43:18.960 --> 02:43:28.400]  out of control look tell me one victory in any field whether it's military not since world war two
[02:43:29.120 --> 02:43:38.720]  with the exception of course of grenade and Panama healthcare education environment everything they
[02:43:38.720 --> 02:43:43.840]  touched they turned to failure but they've been good at robbing us they've been good at robbing us
[02:43:43.840 --> 02:43:49.520]  making us sick and dumb and destroying the middle class they have destroyed the middle class
[02:43:49.520 --> 02:43:56.000]  it's in front of us the numbers again don't lie you have a gap between the rich and the poor
[02:43:56.000 --> 02:44:03.040]  that what according to the Pew Research Center is back to the gilded age days and even worse the
[02:44:03.040 --> 02:44:09.520]  middle class is shot in this country we don't even have a day arrest any roam and it's most
[02:44:09.520 --> 02:44:17.280]  corrupt years you know the 200s and 300s had a bigger middle class than we have yeah so it has
[02:44:17.280 --> 02:44:24.160]  collapsed and what again going back to this banking issue i really believe it's there to
[02:44:24.160 --> 02:44:30.560]  dissuade people to try to get their money out and by the way that's why i believe in gold and and
[02:44:30.560 --> 02:44:35.440]  again guns gold and again even even if it goes up or down doesn't matter at least you got something
[02:44:35.440 --> 02:44:40.560]  buried on the back 40 and everything goes to hell everybody knows gold and silver has value well think
[02:44:40.560 --> 02:44:46.640]  of it like this you're getting negative interest rates in over in europe you put your money in the
[02:44:46.640 --> 02:44:55.920]  bank they're going to charge you to keep it there 0.25 take out a german bond the danish austrian a
[02:44:55.920 --> 02:45:01.840]  whole bunch of them a five-year bond you're going to pay this much for it and you're going to get
[02:45:01.840 --> 02:45:08.320]  that much back you're going to get less back negative yields why would anybody in their right
[02:45:08.320 --> 02:45:18.080]  mind buy a german austrian a danish bond that they know they're going to get paid less at maturity
[02:45:18.640 --> 02:45:25.520]  what do you think that gold prices are going to be lower than they are now in five years
[02:45:25.520 --> 02:45:31.680]  no they can't keep it upside down forever it is just wild now i was waiting for the european
[02:45:31.680 --> 02:45:37.120]  countries they make you pay interest to keep your money in a bank so it's the opposite inverse of
[02:45:37.120 --> 02:45:44.800]  reality exactly and it goes back to what you were saying about why they're sickening the cops on us and
[02:45:44.800 --> 02:45:53.120]  by the way the police in this country have become nothing more than enforcers for the crime bosses
[02:45:53.120 --> 02:46:01.120]  you mentioned about all those scandals in the banks you didn't see one head roll and it's the same
[02:46:01.120 --> 02:46:07.680]  thing when you go down to the lower levels of the police they commit these heinous crimes nobody's
[02:46:07.680 --> 02:46:15.280]  head rolls so they take care of each other you protect me i'll take care of you and that's what
[02:46:15.280 --> 02:46:24.720]  it's become they become enforcers for the democratic and republican crime bosses they'll they you
[02:46:24.720 --> 02:46:33.520]  have you seen there's not one major bank and i love the language they use they committed a misdeed
[02:46:33.520 --> 02:46:42.800]  no we misspoke no we misled how about grand lost city never do you hear that and not one again not
[02:46:42.800 --> 02:46:52.160]  one major conviction under that eric holder who was the so-called attorney general and still tries
[02:46:52.160 --> 02:47:01.760]  to play the role during the obama administration who as the man of change in hope you can believe in
[02:47:01.760 --> 02:47:10.080]  campaign or lied about how wall street was going to pay the price of their criminality so the police
[02:47:10.080 --> 02:47:19.920]  in this country have become enforcers for the crime bosses that's right with hsbc and others
[02:47:20.480 --> 02:47:24.880]  they can wander hundreds of billions and then they pay 111 million in the case of
[02:47:24.880 --> 02:47:32.640]  wells fargo on 300 plus billion and then hsbc it was a bigger fine 1.9 but only because it was
[02:47:32.640 --> 02:47:39.280]  swish but that's still a small fraction of what they've done meanwhile old ladies who run tiny
[02:47:39.280 --> 02:47:44.080]  little mexican food restaurants who are citizens and things it's in the new york times goes every
[02:47:44.080 --> 02:47:49.280]  day and deposits the cash that's their total earnings and a cash and then they put it in the bank
[02:47:49.280 --> 02:47:54.080]  and they seize it saying it's criminal because she put it in the bank i mean it's just it's just
[02:47:54.080 --> 02:48:01.200]  rape everyone it's just rape the little guy gerald again the fish rots from the head down you have
[02:48:01.200 --> 02:48:08.320]  immorality being brought to the top by washington and so the people are behaving as their leaders
[02:48:08.320 --> 02:48:11.920]  gerald i agree with you that the police and many jurisdictions are out of control but
[02:48:11.920 --> 02:48:17.440]  they are they haven't died until you know the cop in uh in uh albuquerque that you know said i'm
[02:48:17.440 --> 02:48:22.720]  going to kill the homeless guy and dead i do see a lot of departments it's a dichotomy it's minor
[02:48:22.720 --> 02:48:28.160]  compared to how they bust out at shops all no i get it i get it especially i've been up there in
[02:48:28.160 --> 02:48:33.280]  the east the really arrogant but but expanding on this all i'm saying is what's the master plan
[02:48:33.280 --> 02:48:38.880]  then you've been a big political advisor and consultant why is soros funding riots against
[02:48:38.880 --> 02:48:45.360]  the police they trying to get a class war going yeah they they have a class war going a class
[02:48:45.360 --> 02:48:52.720]  war has a class war and a racial war keep being initiated by the governments and by these crazy
[02:48:52.720 --> 02:48:59.200]  people again you look at what's going on in this country look how many of these young kids are growing
[02:48:59.200 --> 02:49:06.800]  up with no parents whacked out on drugs there's no job futures how about all those college students
[02:49:06.800 --> 02:49:14.720]  that graduate with what 40 50 60 70 thousand a hundred thousand dollars worth of debt
[02:49:14.720 --> 02:49:20.880]  and they got a degree in on history i mean come on let me ask you this question the arrogance of
[02:49:20.880 --> 02:49:25.920]  government does roll downhill and so i'm guessing have you had police getting your face or be rude
[02:49:25.920 --> 02:49:30.880]  and what do you say to them when they do what's that have you had the police treat you like garbage
[02:49:30.880 --> 02:49:38.320]  and what do you say when they do you know i've had the police treat me in lousy ways rolling through
[02:49:38.320 --> 02:49:47.440]  a stop sign and then being nasty about it happened over here about a year ago and most of them the
[02:49:47.440 --> 02:49:53.040]  local police i have to tell you in kingston they don't break anybody's chops because they have real
[02:49:53.040 --> 02:49:58.880]  problems in a couple of bad neighborhoods and they concentrate on that and they have a police chief
[02:49:58.880 --> 02:50:03.920]  in a mayor that really makes it that well that's what i'm getting at gerald is the media is creating
[02:50:03.920 --> 02:50:07.760]  the perception that the police are out of control and they certainly aren't many levels in the system
[02:50:07.760 --> 02:50:12.560]  lets them do it but they're trying to create a bigger perception to blame everything on the police
[02:50:12.560 --> 02:50:17.040]  instead of the political elite what i'm saying is we need to blame the political elite that set this
[02:50:17.040 --> 02:50:23.200]  up but again you know that i mentioned about the local police then there's the state troopers
[02:50:23.920 --> 02:50:29.840]  man i mean you know you can't go out and have a drink you know without them you know walk the
[02:50:29.840 --> 02:50:36.560]  line do this bend over bow down no it's really it's add a lot didn't use to happen in america it's

[02:55:04.640 --> 02:55:10.400]  now algorithms are deciding whom to hire based on voice why are the elites trying to build a world

[02:55:15.360 --> 02:55:20.320]  it just sounds like more delusional craziness out of the elites where do you in the long term

[02:57:01.120 --> 02:57:07.040]  going to lead either party they're too corrupt they're too in bed with the special interests
[02:57:07.040 --> 02:57:14.640]  let's stop calling it the house of representatives the only ones they represent are the people that
[02:57:14.640 --> 02:57:20.880]  give them money and the people that give them the most money are the drug companies the communications
[02:57:20.880 --> 02:57:26.880]  industry the military industrial and cyber industrial complex what about voting with our
[02:57:26.880 --> 02:57:30.880]  dollars you always talk about creating local communities farmers markets supporting local
[02:57:30.880 --> 02:57:37.600]  shops isn't the model of us wrecking the globalist monsanto and mcdonald's profits plunging isn't
[02:57:37.600 --> 02:57:43.120]  voting with our dollars really the best revolutionary thing we've got right now right now it is but
[02:57:43.120 --> 02:57:49.680]  it's it's at a smaller level and it's going to take a lot of time it has to start from the community
[02:57:49.680 --> 02:57:56.080]  but alex we're going into the 2016 elections and it's going to be one party or another and
[02:57:56.080 --> 02:58:02.480]  as you're looking at it now it's not even a two-party system it's a two-family system i mean
[02:58:02.480 --> 02:58:07.520]  you know how many times i'm sick of hearing about jeb bush or hillary clinton what a joke
[02:58:08.560 --> 02:58:13.600]  what a joke that shows how out of touch the political class is to think that we would support
[02:58:13.600 --> 02:58:21.840]  either one of those people exactly and they're being shoved down our throat could you look at the low
[02:58:21.840 --> 02:58:30.160]  look at the dignity of the white house how low it has sunk could you imagine could you imagine
[02:58:30.160 --> 02:58:36.320]  the white the eisenhower yucking it up with this camel character or or another one it's all a
[02:58:36.320 --> 02:58:40.960]  complete joke all they give us is hype instead of a prosperity we're in it in the main transmission

[03:01:14.640 --> 03:01:20.480]  missile crisis there wasn't rhetoric like this i i mean i really see behavior out of elites that
[03:01:20.480 --> 03:01:24.720]  shows that they really are i mean used to be at least had generals and presidents that have been
[03:01:24.720 --> 03:01:30.800]  in heavy combat like jfk or dwight the eisenhower they weren't perfect but i mean they understood
[03:01:30.800 --> 03:01:36.160]  they weren't bulletproof um i just think that the white shoe boys you talk about are so insulated
[03:01:36.160 --> 03:01:41.360]  they think they're you know what doesn't stink and i see historically the type of hootspa that
[03:01:41.360 --> 03:01:44.560]  destroys civilizations i mean i don't know if we're going to make it because of these people jerald

[03:03:26.960 --> 03:03:35.280]  they call them congressman senator and president well i mean no one imagine ronald reagan saying
[03:03:35.280 --> 03:03:39.840]  we need to send a bunch of dead russians over there that'll teach him that was started a nuclear war
[03:03:39.840 --> 03:03:43.520]  and the russians aren't perfect but i mean they are freaking out getting ready for war
