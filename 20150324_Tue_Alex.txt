[00:00:08.604 --> 00:00:10.165]  It's all a PSYOP.
[00:00:10.165 --> 00:00:16.728]  The threat fusion centers, the militarization of police, military on the streets, TSA on the streets.
[00:00:16.728 --> 00:00:21.690]  During the Boston bombing, half of the houses in the city searched without warrants.
[00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.612]  Women drug out of their homes at gunpoint.
[00:00:24.612 --> 00:00:27.013]  It's all an exercise of power.
[00:00:27.013 --> 00:00:35.177]  It's all a conditioning program to train the American people to accept what is only normal in third world dictatorships.
[00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:40.603]  Will we allow our journey towards despotism and tyranny to be complete?
[00:00:40.603 --> 00:00:45.826]  Or will we turn the situation around and restore our beloved republic?
[00:00:45.826 --> 00:00:47.167]  Police department!
[00:00:47.167 --> 00:00:52.930]  The police and National Guard going street by street, house to house.
[00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.012]  We need to make sure too that whenever we knock on doors, people refuse to leave.
[00:00:57.012 --> 00:00:58.653]  We need to make note, call it in.
[00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.013]  They say there are no orders to use force, just strong persuasion.
[00:01:04.013 --> 00:01:07.775]  Sometimes entering open houses with guns drawn.
[00:01:07.775 --> 00:01:11.298]  And instructions to disarm anyone inside.
[00:01:11.298 --> 00:01:13.159]  You say guns will be taken?
[00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:14.460]  No one will be able to be armed.
[00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.461]  We will take all weapons.
[00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:34.718]  I am responding tonight directly to the Southern Command based in Florida, NORTHCOM based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and to the foreign forces that have seized control of the District of Columbia and are now dismantling our constitutional republic.
[00:01:34.718 --> 00:01:35.898]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:01:35.898 --> 00:01:44.501]  I'm an American and a Texan, and for 20 years I've been on air fighting the globalist agenda, their attempt to dismantle our country and our basic freedoms.
[00:01:45.968 --> 00:01:50.152]  No one can deny that basic American liberties are being eroded.
[00:01:50.152 --> 00:01:52.734]  That the Constitution is being ignored.
[00:01:52.734 --> 00:02:01.161]  That the executive branch is seizing control, dissolving our borders, signing us on to foreign treaties that kill our sovereignty.
[00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:02.863]  It's all out in the open.
[00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:09.085]  Recently, we reported on a public document put out by the U.S.
[00:02:09.085 --> 00:02:17.129]  Army Special Operations Command about a two-month training mission to be carried out in eight states.
[00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:26.854]  In the document, Texas, Utah, and conservative areas of Southern California are listed as hostile areas.
[00:02:26.854 --> 00:02:32.637]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not just looking at this one document by itself, though we've broken it down.
[00:02:33.763 --> 00:02:43.269]  We're looking at the larger spectrum of the transformation of our military and police into a domestic paramilitary force.
[00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.651]  That's now big mainstream news.
[00:02:45.651 --> 00:02:53.396]  I was the first person back in 96 to really start hammering this, not because I was that smart of a person,
[00:02:54.016 --> 00:03:15.582]  But because the emergency manager of Kingsville, Texas, the police chief of San Antonio, and others reached out to me and said that they had been recruited to government meetings by Clinton with Army Special Operations to gauge whether or not they could condition the public to accept military occupation and gun confiscation.
[00:03:15.582 --> 00:03:20.524]  The military basically rebelled against this, leaked the information, and the program was shelved.
[00:03:21.713 --> 00:03:26.716]  Under Bush, it began to grow again, and under Obama, it has exploded.
[00:03:26.716 --> 00:03:33.820]  So tonight, I am addressing the general enlisted, the non-commissioned, and the commissioned officers.
[00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:38.640]  Now, high-level commissioned officers pretty much have the whole picture.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.480]  They're not compartmentalized.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:57.924]  That's why you've seen a major purge of hundreds of generals and thousands of other officers, the biggest in modern history, because they wouldn't go along with the litmus test of accepting what the globalists wanted to do with our military, turning it into a domestic control force over the people.
[00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:09.742]  The reason I'm addressing the Southern Command and others directly tonight is because Joe Biggs and others in our office have been contacted and basically told to back off and shut up.
[00:04:09.742 --> 00:04:17.211]  Military.com, Stars and Stripes, foreign newspapers, you name it, have all come out in the last 24 hours and attacked us.
[00:04:18.212 --> 00:04:30.145]  Bloomberg has attacked us by name, the Daily Beast, you name it, and even then linked to other people's news reports that are discredited in an attempt to make us look like liars.
[00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:33.048]  So there's a major psy-op going on.
[00:04:33.048 --> 00:04:36.231]  They just legalized last year domestic psy-ops to be carried out.
[00:04:36.271 --> 00:04:38.312]  That is a 15-minute special report.
[00:04:38.312 --> 00:04:40.133]  We just aired four and a half minutes of it.
[00:04:40.133 --> 00:04:55.163]  The full report that you need to send directly to military personnel so they're decompartmentalized is posted in the featured news section of InfoWars.com titled, Pentagon Army Engage in PSYOP Against American People.
[00:04:55.163 --> 00:04:57.824]  We've now had the Army Times come out and name us.
[00:04:57.824 --> 00:04:58.565]  It's all coming up.
[00:05:00.185 --> 00:05:03.848]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:03.848 --> 00:05:08.132]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:08.132 --> 00:05:09.893]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:15.238]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[00:05:15.238 --> 00:05:17.760]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.901]  But for how long?
[00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:21.123]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[00:05:21.123 --> 00:05:25.546]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:05:25.546 --> 00:05:27.408]  Infidel Body Armor.
[00:05:27.408 --> 00:05:28.369]  Just won't quit.
[00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:33.242]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:05:33.242 --> 00:05:41.504]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:05:41.504 --> 00:05:46.925]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:05:46.925 --> 00:05:49.446]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:05:49.446 --> 00:05:51.546]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:06:00.146 --> 00:06:01.046]  Alex Jones here.
[00:06:01.046 --> 00:06:10.290]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:15.872]  So many other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients, synthetic additives, and even GMOs.
[00:06:15.872 --> 00:06:24.576]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend, crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts to supercharge and
[00:06:24.636 --> 00:06:29.139]  Prepare your body for what experts admit is the most dangerous season of the year.
[00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:40.546]  We have rejected hundreds of other formulations in our quest to bring you what is simply the most powerful and comprehensive proprietary formula that we have ever created in the realm of herbal immunity.
[00:06:40.546 --> 00:06:48.891]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.
[00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:52.153]  Now is the time to secure ancient defense for you and your family.

[00:06:54.895 --> 00:06:56.857]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:56.857 --> 00:06:58.698]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[00:06:58.698 --> 00:07:01.080]  Good, brother.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.042]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:07:03.042 --> 00:07:04.763]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:07:04.763 --> 00:07:08.786]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and I've made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:07:08.786 --> 00:07:11.409]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:13.831]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:07:13.831 --> 00:07:21.717]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:07:21.857 --> 00:07:25.121]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[00:07:25.121 --> 00:07:26.783]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:07:26.783 --> 00:07:29.666]  We've gotten off the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[00:07:29.666 --> 00:07:31.468]  Saving a ton of money there.
[00:07:31.468 --> 00:07:34.211]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[00:07:34.211 --> 00:07:37.275]  Harvested around the planet and then concentrated.
[00:07:37.535 --> 00:07:39.316]  Or maximum potency.
[00:07:39.316 --> 00:07:45.780]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience.
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.522]  Whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[00:07:49.522 --> 00:07:51.323]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[00:07:51.323 --> 00:07:58.267]  Visit Infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from Infowarslife.
[00:08:09.887 --> 00:08:16.290]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:22.213]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.213 --> 00:08:32.798]  Thank you so much for joining us, my friends, on this live, worldwide, Tuesday edition, the 24th day of March, 2015.
[00:08:32.798 --> 00:08:34.339]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:36.072 --> 00:09:02.634]  Former Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs will be joining us at the bottom of the hour because of the fact that he and I are both being attacked now by name by the Army Times and scores of other publications and they are engaging in classic disinformation ops against the American people.
[00:09:02.634 --> 00:09:04.916]  You can see the tactics of
[00:09:07.458 --> 00:09:12.582]  Deception that are here.
[00:09:12.582 --> 00:09:26.392]  And there is a 15-minute video that I shot for the Nightly News last night that's red-linked on Infowars.com titled, Army and MSM Launch Disinfo Psyops Against the American People.
[00:09:26.392 --> 00:09:29.975]  Special Operations Leadership Attempts to Downplay Military Drills.
[00:09:29.975 --> 00:09:33.818]  Listing Texas as Hostile.
[00:09:33.818 --> 00:09:35.760]  And what they go on to deny
[00:09:37.978 --> 00:10:00.413]  is that there's basically any plan for the military to be used in domestic disturbances or for gun confiscation or for martial law when in the last twenty years we've seen it grow into a giant official main mission of NorthCom and SouthCom to suppress the American people.
[00:10:00.413 --> 00:10:00.894]  They try to
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:11.524]  Deceive the military and deceive the public and deceive law enforcement by saying, oh, there's anti-military groups that are claiming all these lies.
[00:10:11.524 --> 00:10:29.593]  No, in our report we shot last night, we show more than 40 mainstream news articles and official government documents stating the plan to have a national police force under the president commanded by the U.S.
[00:10:29.593 --> 00:10:30.113]  military.
[00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:40.612]  It has nothing to do with the troops on the ground who are being basically put into these positions.
[00:10:40.612 --> 00:10:57.598]  And the fact that they would deny for decades that they were militarizing or federalizing police, that they would deny that they were moving towards the North American Union, that they would deny that they were moving towards a plan to dissolve the borders that was in the SPP, the Security Prosperity Partnership, that they would deny that there was even an Asia
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:05.442]  Pacific Partnership that's now being ratified secretly and Congress can't even get a copy of it.
[00:11:05.442 --> 00:11:12.304]  That was in Bloomberg and The Guardian and CNBC Sunday.
[00:11:12.304 --> 00:11:14.044]  All of this is real.
[00:11:14.044 --> 00:11:15.745]  All of this is happening.
[00:11:15.745 --> 00:11:23.367]  And they don't want to ever admit any of it's happening, even though it's happening in plain view, so that we can never have a debate about it.
[00:11:26.957 --> 00:11:32.138]  The military is being also replaced with autonomous robots.
[00:11:32.138 --> 00:11:37.539]  Land, sea, and air.
[00:11:37.539 --> 00:11:45.401]  That was announced a decade ago that by 2025, basically the entire fighting force would be robotic.
[00:11:45.401 --> 00:11:50.522]  Look at the Brisbane Times today.
[00:11:50.522 --> 00:11:54.083]  Robots to replace almost half of jobs over the next 20 years, expert.
[00:11:57.907 --> 00:12:08.415]  Steve Wozniak, one of the founders of Apple, the future of AI is scary and very bad for people.
[00:12:08.415 --> 00:12:12.017]  They're all warning us, Bill Joy, you name it, the ones that have a conscience.
[00:12:12.017 --> 00:12:14.439]  And you ask, why does this tie into the military?
[00:12:14.439 --> 00:12:19.663]  Because the globalists are publicly building a world not for people.
[00:12:20.981 --> 00:12:23.921]  We're having a debate about loving our military?
[00:12:23.921 --> 00:12:26.982]  Who doesn't archetypally love their warriors?
[00:12:26.982 --> 00:12:31.023]  If a civilization doesn't respect their warriors, they die.
[00:12:31.023 --> 00:12:32.923]  If you don't respect your women, you fall apart.
[00:12:32.923 --> 00:12:37.204]  If you don't respect children and the family, you're dying.
[00:12:37.204 --> 00:12:50.026]  And all of that's being dismantled, and the very globalists that have seized the country, that have the borders wide open, that are moving against our Second Amendment, are in Newsweek, Bloomberg, Daily Beast,
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:13:01.026]  New York Magazine, I mean I'm not exaggerating, hundreds of publications in the last week, not just on this military story but others, have opened fire on us.
[00:13:01.026 --> 00:13:03.608]  And I say praise the Lord.
[00:13:03.608 --> 00:13:04.889]  Literally.
[00:13:04.889 --> 00:13:05.709]  I love it.
[00:13:05.709 --> 00:13:08.251]  When I get attacked, I know I'm over the target.
[00:13:08.251 --> 00:13:11.493]  That's my radar to go right in like a radar guided missile.
[00:13:11.493 --> 00:13:13.414]  Right into the enemy.
[00:13:13.414 --> 00:13:17.016]  They turn on their radar to try to scan us, try to attack us.
[00:13:17.016 --> 00:13:19.478]  All that is is a homing beacon for me to go right in on the enemy.
[00:13:20.734 --> 00:13:28.999]  I point my nose right at the heaviest fire I can get and go straight in.
[00:13:28.999 --> 00:13:31.021]  And it's really intensifying and I love it.
[00:13:31.775 --> 00:13:33.776]  So bring it, whatever it is.
[00:13:33.776 --> 00:13:37.817]  And I'm not looking for a fight, I'm not looking for trouble, I'm not looking to be set up or killed.
[00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:41.559]  But hey, if that comes with it, praise the Lord, it's part of God's plan.
[00:13:41.559 --> 00:13:55.864]  I'm gonna tell the truth, and I'm gonna expose abortion, and I'm gonna expose gun control, and open borders, and planetary tyranny, until I am six feet under, pushing daisies, until I'm on the black side, not the green side.
[00:13:55.864 --> 00:13:56.784]  You got it?
[00:13:56.784 --> 00:13:57.645]  That's what's gonna happen.
[00:13:58.425 --> 00:14:02.428]  It feels good in my soul, in my heart, in my intellect.
[00:14:02.428 --> 00:14:04.290]  My morale's never been higher.
[00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:06.111]  My crew's morale's never been higher.
[00:14:06.111 --> 00:14:08.753]  And the Liberty Movement's morale's never been higher.
[00:14:08.753 --> 00:14:12.656]  We are firing up to defeat the globalists.
[00:14:12.656 --> 00:14:14.858]  End of story.
[00:14:14.858 --> 00:14:20.983]  And folks can crawl in a ditch and submit to all this or live in denial about it and take their real coward's way out.
[00:14:20.983 --> 00:14:23.025]  Or you can decide to do something about it!
[00:14:24.138 --> 00:14:29.421]  But if you want to do something about it, you've got to first admit to yourself, this war is going on and this war is real.
[00:14:29.421 --> 00:14:38.205]  This republic is in a death battle right now with globalist forces that have seized control of the District of Criminals.
[00:14:38.205 --> 00:14:39.045]  Remember this article?
[00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:43.427]  Out of Foreign Policy, Washington Post last year, the U.S.
[00:14:43.427 --> 00:14:47.029]  repeals propaganda ban, spreads government-made news to Americans.
[00:14:49.537 --> 00:14:51.378]  And here's the latest articles today.
[00:14:51.378 --> 00:14:57.302]  Conspiracy groups question USA South Com mission in Texas.
[00:14:57.302 --> 00:15:00.564]  And they go into attacking Joe Biggs and myself.
[00:15:00.564 --> 00:15:03.946]  A direct shake and bake.
[00:15:03.946 --> 00:15:07.008]  This is a direct psyop, classic lies.
[00:15:07.008 --> 00:15:09.990]  I knew what they would write before they wrote it.
[00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:11.971]  And they've done it exactly as we knew they would.
[00:15:11.971 --> 00:15:12.752]  What a joke.
[00:15:13.735 --> 00:15:23.199]  What a sick joke to try to make everything we say sound like a lie without ever actually linking to our claims.
[00:15:23.199 --> 00:15:27.821]  That's what they always do.
[00:15:27.821 --> 00:15:30.582]  And this is meant to manipulate the military more than anybody else.
[00:15:32.452 --> 00:15:38.335]  I remember when they came out for two weeks after Katrina, when we were reporting they were gun confiscating, and they said, no, no one's doing that.
[00:15:38.335 --> 00:15:45.978]  And then they decided to flip back, go, okay, we'll just show the video on TV, try to sell to the public on ABC, NBC, CBS.
[00:15:45.978 --> 00:15:52.861]  Remember Obama said, I'm not coming after any of your guns, not your rifles, not your shotguns, not your semi-autos, not your handguns.
[00:15:52.861 --> 00:15:57.183]  He had Joe Biden say it over and over again in the first campaign.
[00:16:00.336 --> 00:16:01.797]  2008.
[00:16:01.797 --> 00:16:02.958]  Over and over again.
[00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:06.620]  And then, when he came after your guns, he said, we're not coming after your guns.
[00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:15.125]  And Bloomberg was in the news, funding tens of millions of dollars a month to get our guns, and to finance state elections and city elections all over the country.
[00:16:15.125 --> 00:16:20.628]  He had an article, well he gave a speech saying, I'm the most pro-Second Amendment person there is.
[00:16:20.628 --> 00:16:23.190]  I believe in the right to keep and bear arms.
[00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:28.613]  While he was pushing the total abolition of civilian ownership of firearms and the UN Unitary Treaty.
[00:16:29.568 --> 00:16:31.929]  There is no attempt to put military on the streets.
[00:16:31.929 --> 00:16:33.670]  There is no attempt to take your guns.
[00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:35.191]  You can keep your doctor.
[00:16:35.191 --> 00:16:40.914]  It'll cut your health bill in half to the cost of a phone bill or cable bill.
[00:16:40.914 --> 00:16:43.315]  Raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit.
[00:16:43.315 --> 00:16:45.556]  You didn't build your business.
[00:16:45.556 --> 00:16:50.819]  I'm not going to open up the borders.
[00:16:50.819 --> 00:16:53.881]  I mean, do people recognize ball-faced lies when they're in our face?
[00:16:55.646 --> 00:16:58.567]  I mean, I'm not even that smart.
[00:16:58.567 --> 00:17:07.808]  I just got common sense when people are sitting there shoveling lies and setting up classical tyrannies here in this republic.
[00:17:07.808 --> 00:17:16.710]  They announced two weeks ago they're going to start executive action taking private IRAs and education funds.
[00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:20.851]  They announced that they're going to start arresting anybody who keeps cash even though there's no law.
[00:17:22.061 --> 00:17:28.703]  They are announcing all of this across the board right now.
[00:17:28.703 --> 00:17:32.744]  It all goes together like a horse and carriage.
[00:17:32.744 --> 00:17:35.925]  Look at this article, New York Times mentioned this.
[00:17:35.925 --> 00:17:39.446]  Law lets IRS seize accounts on suspicion, no crime required.
[00:17:39.446 --> 00:17:47.088]  And it talks about 40 years Carol Henders dished out Mexican specialties at her Modest Cash Only restaurant.
[00:17:47.088 --> 00:17:49.789]  Had like eight seats at the diner.
[00:17:51.667 --> 00:17:59.090]  For just as long, she deposited the earnings in a small bank branch a block away.
[00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:10.235]  And it goes through in the lengthy article that it was all had taxes paid on it and everything, and that they still basically took everything out of her bank account and moved to start indicting her, and then they admitted this happens to tens of thousands of people.
[00:18:10.235 --> 00:18:13.357]  There isn't even a law.
[00:18:13.357 --> 00:18:18.559]  They say law, they interpret a law, kind of like the ATF says they're interpreting this 223 situation.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.961]  So that headline is not even accurate.
[00:18:24.961 --> 00:18:25.981]  But this is what's going on.
[00:18:25.981 --> 00:18:32.722]  Now that dovetails with our article that's linked on DrugsReport.com right now to talk about tyranny.
[00:18:32.722 --> 00:18:41.244]  Feds urge banks to call cops on customers who withdraw $5,000 or more.
[00:18:41.244 --> 00:18:49.606]  When I take a crew of five or six reporters to Europe, I give them all $2,000 and they give me receipts, but in case the cards quit working, which happens all the time.
[00:18:53.186 --> 00:18:53.886]  We've got money.
[00:18:53.886 --> 00:18:56.107]  That's not... We're carrying $10,000 cash on us.
[00:18:56.107 --> 00:18:56.747]  We're not criminals.
[00:18:56.747 --> 00:18:58.627]  Cash isn't illegal.
[00:18:58.627 --> 00:19:09.610]  This whole phony drug war, the banks launder the drug money publicly, and then they act like we're criminal, taking company money or after-tax money out of the bank.
[00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:21.394]  And then they've got kangaroo juries on these federal juries, who a lot of times are government agents, and the judge will order them to convict you, even though there's no statute there.
[00:19:21.394 --> 00:19:22.334]  Or the statute says,
[00:19:24.841 --> 00:19:34.145]  Tens of thousands of dollars over and over again that wasn't after tax that you're then keeping and not paying tax on, but they just apply it to something else.
[00:19:34.145 --> 00:19:36.566]  Just like the IRS is going after the Tea Party right now.
[00:19:36.566 --> 00:19:38.287]  This is persecution.
[00:19:38.287 --> 00:19:40.588]  We'll tell you about this when we come back.
[00:19:40.588 --> 00:19:42.649]  But it all ties in together
[00:19:44.156 --> 00:19:46.798]  On every front, we're going into a tyranny.
[00:19:46.798 --> 00:19:49.499]  And a lot of people say, well, I'll just bend over and do whatever I'm told.
[00:19:49.499 --> 00:19:53.681]  That will ensure total destruction of our freedoms.
[00:19:53.681 --> 00:19:57.003]  Do you understand they're announcing they're going to take your pension funds?
[00:19:57.003 --> 00:19:58.124]  That's why they're getting the army ready.
[00:20:00.046 --> 00:20:07.031]  By now you know that wireless technology like cell phones do in fact pose dangers to the health and privacy of everyone.

[00:23:49.474 --> 00:23:49.834]  Call right now!
[00:24:05.971 --> 00:24:06.612]  I think so.
[00:24:49.264 --> 00:24:55.549]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live and we've got the Foo Fighters bringing us in asking, who are you?
[00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:57.851]  Which side are you on?
[00:24:57.851 --> 00:25:06.639]  The choice has never been clearer that our republic is in the grip of a global corporate conspiracy calling itself the New World Order.
[00:25:08.027 --> 00:25:14.693]  Establishing a new form of dictatorship known as technocracy over the planet.
[00:25:14.693 --> 00:25:18.696]  This has been announced at Davos this year, last year, and the year before.
[00:25:18.696 --> 00:25:23.680]  It's been announced by Zbigniew Brzezinski all over the news and in three different, four different books.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:28.684]  It's been announced on CNBC over and over and over again.
[00:25:28.684 --> 00:25:29.926]  It's been announced in the
[00:25:31.434 --> 00:25:42.677]  Financial Times of London, by their foreign editor, who attacked us a few years ago, and said, and now for world government, was the headline.
[00:25:42.677 --> 00:25:53.761]  And then after we read his article on air, he wrote another article attacking us by name, and said, world government doesn't exist, and that we were insane.
[00:25:53.761 --> 00:25:55.601]  This is the mind game they play.
[00:25:55.601 --> 00:25:58.922]  No one's coming after your guns, we just want you to turn them in.
[00:25:58.922 --> 00:26:00.923]  And we got a bunch of bills to do it.
[00:26:02.532 --> 00:26:06.074]  Obamacare cuts your prices in half, even though it doubles or triples them.
[00:26:06.074 --> 00:26:16.218]  It's classic gaslighting, which is a psychological term known since the 30s, where you walk up and say, punch your wife in the nose, and then she gets knocked out.
[00:26:16.218 --> 00:26:19.300]  When she gets up, you go, baby, I didn't punch you in the nose.
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:23.442]  She's like, I saw you, and you know, you fell and hit your nose.
[00:26:23.442 --> 00:26:28.184]  And if you say it with enough confidence to a weak-minded person, they will actually believe it.
[00:26:30.848 --> 00:26:37.152]  And that's what's happening is we're being gaslighted.
[00:26:37.152 --> 00:26:38.833]  And gaslighting is a natural thing.
[00:26:38.833 --> 00:26:44.577]  I'm sure you've all experienced a loved one or someone be really rude or mean to you and say something really horrible.
[00:26:44.577 --> 00:26:47.579]  And you say, you just said this to me.
[00:26:47.579 --> 00:26:50.301]  And they'll go, no, I didn't.
[00:26:50.301 --> 00:26:53.963]  You'll go, yes, you most certainly did 10 seconds ago.
[00:26:53.963 --> 00:26:54.664]  No, I didn't say that.
[00:26:58.407 --> 00:27:02.169]  That is a tactic that we see more and more in this society.
[00:27:02.169 --> 00:27:12.715]  And I'll say it psychologically, and it's in the psychological research papers that are out there, women do that more often than men, and women are more susceptible to gaslighting.
[00:27:12.715 --> 00:27:16.257]  Women do it more, and they're more susceptible to it.
[00:27:16.257 --> 00:27:19.899]  Now, I'm not knocking women, just in the psychological archetypes, it's well known.
[00:27:21.212 --> 00:27:22.913]  Men are more likely to be psychopaths.
[00:27:22.913 --> 00:27:24.575]  Men are more likely to steal.
[00:27:24.575 --> 00:27:31.500]  Men are more likely to be into weird, deviant, bizarre stuff in the criminology.
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:36.524]  I think it's something like 25 to 1 men committing murders to women.
[00:27:36.524 --> 00:27:40.387]  It's almost 100 to 1 men being psychopaths versus women.
[00:27:40.387 --> 00:27:42.328]  So I'm not bashing women.
[00:27:42.328 --> 00:27:48.073]  But women are extremely suggestible and extremely manipulatable.
[00:27:48.894 --> 00:27:50.895]  When they're in an unconscious state.
[00:27:50.895 --> 00:27:53.716]  And the whole culture is about putting people in that state.
[00:27:53.716 --> 00:27:58.299]  So what the Pentagon's doing, going, there's no plan for the military on the streets.
[00:27:58.299 --> 00:28:00.480]  It's crazy and anti-military.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.021]  There's no plan to militarize.
[00:28:02.021 --> 00:28:04.282]  There's no plan to take over.
[00:28:04.282 --> 00:28:06.383]  Alex thinks we're taking over this summer.
[00:28:06.383 --> 00:28:08.744]  We're not going to invade and take over the statehouse.
[00:28:10.046 --> 00:28:12.189]  We didn't say you were going to do that.
[00:28:12.189 --> 00:28:20.380]  We said in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, it talks about putting down rebellions in the states, including governors and legislators.
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:20.901]  Look it up!
[00:28:22.483 --> 00:28:28.065]  We said there's a plan for Brigade Homeland to have brigades in every region to suppress the people.
[00:28:28.065 --> 00:28:39.148]  And in all your training manuals that we got and we broke that are now all over the news, from the Washington Post to Fox News, you train to take on your new number one enemy.
[00:28:39.148 --> 00:28:43.129]  And it isn't ISIS, it isn't Iran, it isn't Russia, it isn't China.
[00:28:44.011 --> 00:28:58.165]  It isn't drug lords, it is returning veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, evangelical Christians, anti-Fellow Reserve activists.
[00:28:58.165 --> 00:29:01.708]  And then you sit there and talk to me like I'm two years old.
[00:29:02.563 --> 00:29:08.545]  And say, Joe Biggs claims he was in the Army and he's on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:08.545 --> 00:29:10.925]  That's in the Army Times.
[00:29:10.925 --> 00:29:11.965]  Little stuff like that.
[00:29:11.965 --> 00:29:16.747]  Every line is written to deceive people.
[00:29:16.747 --> 00:29:29.470]  Joe Biggs is a famous soldier because he had Michael Hastings and other people embedded with him in major battles in Iraq and Afghanistan and was just, by the bad luck of it, blown up in armored vehicles twice in front of the media.
[00:29:32.938 --> 00:29:35.440]  And then everybody knows who Joe Biggs is.
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.702]  You can Google his name.
[00:29:36.702 --> 00:29:40.906]  You can see him in army reports, you know, loading munitions ten years ago.
[00:29:40.906 --> 00:29:44.869]  But they sit there and say, oh, how about this?
[00:29:44.869 --> 00:29:46.891]  How about I claim I'm a radio host too?
[00:29:46.891 --> 00:29:48.533]  How about I claim the world's round?
[00:29:48.533 --> 00:29:49.734]  Your garbage doesn't work on us.
[00:29:49.734 --> 00:29:50.815]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.815 --> 00:29:53.357]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.357 --> 00:29:56.020]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.276 --> 00:30:01.537]  Another major health threat.
[00:30:01.537 --> 00:30:06.519]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:30:06.519 --> 00:30:09.180]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:16.223]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:30:16.223 --> 00:30:19.204]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:30:19.204 --> 00:30:22.246]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:30:22.246 --> 00:30:24.187]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:30:24.187 --> 00:30:27.008]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:30:27.108 --> 00:30:32.831]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:30:32.831 --> 00:30:36.353]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:30:36.353 --> 00:30:39.455]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:30:39.455 --> 00:30:43.737]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have.
[00:30:43.857 --> 00:30:46.760]  For every modern independently minded household.

[00:31:30.083 --> 00:31:33.745]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:31:33.745 --> 00:31:38.026]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:31:38.026 --> 00:31:39.787]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:31:39.787 --> 00:31:47.650]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:48.791]  But for how long?
[00:31:48.791 --> 00:31:55.434]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:31:55.434 --> 00:31:58.255]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:31:59.998 --> 00:32:06.103]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[00:32:06.103 --> 00:32:10.706]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[00:32:10.706 --> 00:32:18.412]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[00:32:18.652 --> 00:32:24.177]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[00:32:24.177 --> 00:32:30.123]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[00:32:30.123 --> 00:32:35.087]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[00:32:35.087 --> 00:32:38.671]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:32:38.991 --> 00:32:45.616]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[00:32:45.616 --> 00:32:50.759]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[00:32:50.759 --> 00:32:54.502]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:54.502 --> 00:32:56.403]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:33:17.612 --> 00:33:22.653]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:33:22.653 --> 00:33:31.856]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:31.856 --> 00:33:37.437]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:37.437 --> 00:33:41.558]  I'm your host Alex Jones, dedicated American to our constitutional republic.
[00:33:42.893 --> 00:33:45.135]  Here is the headlines that are coming up.
[00:33:45.135 --> 00:33:50.700]  Conspiracy groups question USA South Com Mission in Texas.
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:55.664]  And boy, you talk about a disinfo piece, it's much worse than Stars and Stripes the day before.
[00:33:55.664 --> 00:34:02.711]  There are more than, let's not exaggerate, 20 major publications right now attacking us just on this front with disinformation.
[00:34:03.894 --> 00:34:04.134]  I think?
[00:34:25.799 --> 00:34:27.080]  Then, U.N.
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:31.461]  warns world could have 40% water shortfall by 2030.
[00:34:31.461 --> 00:34:34.142]  That's their new fear-mongering.
[00:34:34.142 --> 00:34:35.363]  But they don't discuss this.
[00:34:35.363 --> 00:34:37.384]  Another month of record cold.
[00:34:37.384 --> 00:34:43.266]  But reasons to be optimistic as more snowstorms hit from Chicago to New York.
[00:34:43.266 --> 00:34:44.787]  Our laws, not Sharia.
[00:34:44.787 --> 00:34:49.789]  Female mayor tells unhappy Muslims respect them, obey them, embrace them.
[00:34:49.789 --> 00:34:52.510]  The city's Muslim activists weren't happy.
[00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:55.051]  We've got video of that coming up in the next hour.
[00:34:55.939 --> 00:35:08.189]  And again, I'm not Islamophobic, but I am against radical Islam, and I don't like foreigners coming here and telling me, a libertarian constitutionalist, a real liberal, in the Thomas Jefferson vein, how to live.
[00:35:08.189 --> 00:35:11.272]  I'm tolerant, but you do not tell me how to live.
[00:35:12.219 --> 00:35:15.003]  And they got mad and said they want Sharia law.
[00:35:15.003 --> 00:35:17.287]  So see, this is smart of the City Council.
[00:35:17.287 --> 00:35:20.932]  They're showing, no, this isn't made up that people want Sharia law.
[00:35:20.932 --> 00:35:24.958]  There's really a push and people setting up their own courts.
[00:35:24.958 --> 00:35:28.002]  And you know, I'm sorry, my daughters aren't going to wear hoods on their heads.
[00:35:28.903 --> 00:35:44.018]  And, uh, I'm gonna do whatever I want, and nobody, not the government, or some islamicist, or some politically correct, see I don't like politically correct either, with their own kin pecking, you know, religion of talk like we talk, do what we do.
[00:35:44.018 --> 00:35:44.919]  No!
[00:35:44.919 --> 00:35:45.559]  No!
[00:35:45.559 --> 00:35:47.081]  I am not your slave!
[00:35:47.081 --> 00:35:48.622]  You do not control my mind!
[00:35:48.622 --> 00:35:49.964]  Got it?
[00:35:49.964 --> 00:35:51.025]  I'm an American!
[00:35:51.025 --> 00:35:51.825]  I'm into freedom!
[00:35:52.734 --> 00:35:59.220]  I'm into private property and my family and prosperity and 700 horsepower cars.
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:00.201]  That's what I'm into.
[00:36:00.201 --> 00:36:00.862]  Freedom!
[00:36:00.862 --> 00:36:03.304]  The Second Amendment, not being a slave.
[00:36:03.304 --> 00:36:04.946]  Excuse me, I'm ranting.
[00:36:04.946 --> 00:36:07.128]  I'm just getting sick of it.
[00:36:07.128 --> 00:36:11.392]  And this huge article I mentioned, robots replace almost half of jobs over the next 20 years.
[00:36:14.983 --> 00:36:18.945]  Former head of Apple comes out and says the future of AI is scary and very bad for people.
[00:36:18.945 --> 00:36:19.865]  That all ties together.
[00:36:19.865 --> 00:36:24.467]  12,000 more illegal kids already over the border in the last month.
[00:36:24.467 --> 00:36:26.728]  Apple soon to be a $1 trillion company.
[00:36:26.728 --> 00:36:28.369]  Report Israel spied on Iran.
[00:36:28.369 --> 00:36:29.710]  Nuke negotiations.
[00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:34.153]  Monsanto hit with fine for genetically contaminating wheat supply.
[00:36:34.153 --> 00:36:37.215]  Rand Paul, I'm the only Republican that beats Hillary Clinton.
[00:36:37.215 --> 00:36:44.781]  I agree, that's why he's better than Cruz, because he's more libertarian than Cruz and attracts more liberals that aren't actually criminals.
[00:36:44.781 --> 00:36:47.223]  So, and that's what major polls have shown for a long time.
[00:36:47.223 --> 00:36:48.924]  We first reported on that a few years ago.
[00:36:48.924 --> 00:36:51.206]  Rand Paul's picking up on that.
[00:36:51.206 --> 00:36:56.650]  But before I go any further, with the anatomy of a PSYOP, with former Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs here today,
[00:36:57.887 --> 00:37:06.637]  I want to just briefly tell you about our new product, one of many high-quality organic products of the highest concentrations at Infowarslife.com.
[00:37:06.637 --> 00:37:08.719]  That's Winter Sun.
[00:37:08.719 --> 00:37:11.422]  If you guys give me a document cam shot, I'll show folks here.
[00:37:11.422 --> 00:37:15.407]  It's ultra-vitamin D3, premium quality.
[00:37:16.408 --> 00:37:21.869]  Dietary supplement you need this year around, but especially in the fall, winter, and spring.
[00:37:21.869 --> 00:37:23.490]  And it is just a basic building block.
[00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:29.331]  This comes from lichen, so it's much more absorbable, according to the research Dr. Grupp and others have done.
[00:37:29.331 --> 00:37:33.012]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin B3 nutritional supplement.
[00:37:33.012 --> 00:37:34.032]  It's liquid.
[00:37:34.032 --> 00:37:35.393]  It's never been heated.
[00:37:35.393 --> 00:37:40.774]  It's processed by extracting oil from healthy nutrient-based plants known as lichens.
[00:37:40.774 --> 00:37:43.615]  It is unprecedented, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:43.615 --> 00:37:44.895]  Winter Sun.
[00:37:45.575 --> 00:37:58.808]  Winner's son now available at Infowarslife.com and we only got a certain amount in on the first run and we don't do this as a gimmick to sell stuff even though saying stuff selling out does that is a sales tactic used.
[00:37:58.808 --> 00:38:02.792]  We actually don't know how good a product will do when it's in first run.
[00:38:02.792 --> 00:38:04.954]  So we used to sell out of the Nascent Iodine for two, three months.
[00:38:04.954 --> 00:38:06.836]  We'd sell out of Supermel for two, three months.
[00:38:06.836 --> 00:38:08.918]  We were sold out for four months of DNA Force.
[00:38:09.819 --> 00:38:11.820]  I thought this would take two, three weeks to sell out.
[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:15.000]  It could be sold out by next Sunday.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.621]  So if you want to try this out, it'll be about three to six weeks till we get more.
[00:38:18.621 --> 00:38:21.442]  Just like we've been sold out now of Super Female for weeks.
[00:38:21.442 --> 00:38:25.023]  If you want to get Winter Sun, it's available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:38:25.023 --> 00:38:28.644]  And regardless, you're supporting the broadcast.
[00:38:28.644 --> 00:38:30.485]  But this is basically a hormone.
[00:38:30.485 --> 00:38:33.586]  They call it vitamin D3, but it's one of the basic building blocks of the body.
[00:38:33.586 --> 00:38:34.686]  Most people are deficient.
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:41.002]  Most people don't absorb as much of it out of things like mushrooms and other things.
[00:38:41.002 --> 00:38:45.864]  Most folks get the synthetic, cheap vitamin D2, does nothing, according to the research we've seen.
[00:38:45.864 --> 00:38:47.665]  This is true, organic, D3.
[00:38:49.122 --> 00:38:52.746]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:38:52.746 --> 00:38:54.207]  888-253-3139.
[00:38:54.207 --> 00:39:00.554]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:39:00.554 --> 00:39:07.982]  Please also tell folks about our local AM and FM affiliates, support local sponsors, or become a sponsor of the local station you're listening to.
[00:39:10.458 --> 00:39:12.359]  Now, shifting gears.
[00:39:12.359 --> 00:39:20.164]  We're going to cover this for the balance of the hour, not because it's InfoWars.com in the news.
[00:39:20.164 --> 00:39:31.272]  InfoWars.com and my reporters and our reports and yours truly are effectively being attacked five, six, seven, eight times a day by national TV and by print.
[00:39:31.272 --> 00:39:34.734]  We can't even keep track of local papers and other talk show hosts attacking us.
[00:39:34.734 --> 00:39:36.375]  We're not crying about that.
[00:39:36.375 --> 00:39:37.236]  We love it.
[00:39:37.856 --> 00:39:45.640]  We're on a seek-and-destroy mission, to use military terminology from Vietnam, to find the globalists, to find their lies, and engage them.
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:46.861]  We have the truth.
[00:39:46.861 --> 00:39:48.201]  We have Americana.
[00:39:48.201 --> 00:39:49.262]  We have common sense.
[00:39:49.262 --> 00:39:51.923]  We're ready.
[00:39:51.923 --> 00:39:56.446]  We are doing the right thing, standing up for basic freedom.
[00:39:56.446 --> 00:39:58.086]  So, we're the good guys.
[00:39:58.086 --> 00:39:58.807]  We have nothing to hide.
[00:39:59.977 --> 00:40:05.559]  The enemy is constantly the globalists that have hijacked our country that, again, on CNBC admit they have.
[00:40:05.559 --> 00:40:06.699]  I mean, this is all over the news.
[00:40:06.699 --> 00:40:08.419]  We're going into secret treaties right now.
[00:40:08.419 --> 00:40:10.180]  33 secret points.
[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:12.260]  One point was leaked last year by WikiLeaks.
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.001]  Total end of internet freedom.
[00:40:14.001 --> 00:40:20.023]  You notice they just did the power grab with the FCC to get in line with the treaty that Congress can't even see.
[00:40:20.023 --> 00:40:24.084]  Just like the head of the FCC said, I'm not even going to meet with Congress.
[00:40:25.851 --> 00:40:28.872]  They're announcing they're going to arrest you for pulling any cash out of the bank, $5,000.
[00:40:28.872 --> 00:40:34.735]  They're announcing they're getting ready to take your kids' education funds.
[00:40:34.735 --> 00:40:38.496]  I mean, it's so much tyranny.
[00:40:38.496 --> 00:40:41.517]  On a scale of 1 to 10, it's a 10, that it's moving so fast.
[00:40:41.517 --> 00:40:44.599]  It is moving at warp speed.
[00:40:44.599 --> 00:40:51.902]  And then, we get sent by one of our sources, I'll leave it at that, that, hey, this is hidden behind a firewall.
[00:40:52.833 --> 00:40:54.535]  But it's unclassified.
[00:40:54.535 --> 00:40:56.637]  They're supposed to be releasing this.
[00:40:56.637 --> 00:41:02.783]  A little bird just put it on Scripps, the big document site.
[00:41:02.783 --> 00:41:03.423]  So that's a trick.
[00:41:03.423 --> 00:41:06.686]  When something's supposed to be declassified, they'll still hide it.
[00:41:06.686 --> 00:41:12.792]  So now for four or five days, they've had the different publications, Stars and Stripes, Military.com.
[00:41:13.746 --> 00:41:14.166]  I don't know.
[00:41:33.214 --> 00:41:38.675]  Move the attention away from the fact that that's going on and just keep throwing out the conspiracy term and keep attacking us.
[00:41:38.675 --> 00:41:45.377]  So it takes people's attention off of the fact that there is a mission going to happen, just like it says in the documents.
[00:41:45.377 --> 00:41:46.677]  They're not denying it.
[00:41:46.677 --> 00:41:52.978]  And then you got contacted by one of your friends that you served with, saying, shut up, it's a PSYOP, get none of your business.
[00:41:52.978 --> 00:41:54.258]  Yeah.
[00:41:54.258 --> 00:41:56.319]  And then I have the Washington Post, U.S.
[00:41:56.319 --> 00:41:58.999]  Repeals Propaganda Ban, Spreads Government-Made News.
[00:41:58.999 --> 00:42:01.400]  I want to get your take on this show, but give them people background here.
[00:42:02.625 --> 00:42:11.156]  They're now in Army Times today, saying the headline on Infowars reads, Feds Preparing to Invade Texas, Lists State as Hostile.
[00:42:11.156 --> 00:42:21.348]  State site founder Alex Jones said in a taped segment that it's likely preparation for military actions to follow an imminent financial collapse on the end of Barack Obama's presidential term.
[00:42:22.199 --> 00:42:24.641]  And another segment on the side, they try to act like we're confused.
[00:42:24.641 --> 00:42:28.705]  No, we're throwing out different options here, different scenarios.
[00:42:28.705 --> 00:42:44.378]  Joe Biggs, cited as a veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq, he's been in the Army many times, I mean, they have loading munitions, said the exercises would prepare troops to throw citizens in FEMA, Federal Emergency Management Camps, citing as evidence the military's desire to train in an environment similar to where they'll fight.
[00:42:44.378 --> 00:42:46.800]  Well, they say in the document, to win our hearts and minds.
[00:42:48.288 --> 00:42:49.249]  Then they go on.
[00:42:49.249 --> 00:42:52.053]  But if you read the whole article, they call us conspiracy theorists.
[00:42:52.053 --> 00:42:53.335]  They say, oh, it's for overseas.
[00:42:53.335 --> 00:42:55.378]  Well, obviously, it has dual uses.
[00:42:55.378 --> 00:43:03.629]  But they never debate the stacks of articles that we show in our video on InfoWars.com.
[00:43:03.629 --> 00:43:04.711]  It's red-linked right now.
[00:43:05.151 --> 00:43:10.654]  That I shot last night, Army and MSM launched this info, saw it up against the American people.
[00:43:10.654 --> 00:43:24.862]  We show more than 40 news articles and Rand Corporation and Pentagon documents admitting the main missions, conservatives, libertarians, gun owners and Tea Party, every chance they get during an emergency, they're gun confiscating, to get to see if the military will do it.
[00:43:26.221 --> 00:43:30.904]  And so it's not that we're against the military, we're against them being put in this position.
[00:43:30.904 --> 00:43:41.771]  And Joe, the reason we know about this is because the military has been leaking the info before it was even declassified because they don't like being given this unconstitutional training.
[00:43:41.771 --> 00:43:47.594]  So there's a battle, not just for the hearts and minds of the people to go along with this, but the military.
[00:43:47.594 --> 00:43:54.819]  You've got a joint command of the Navy, the Air Force, and the Army, and the Marines, all four groups, the Marines under the Navy,
[00:43:55.691 --> 00:44:03.939]  With the sailors and soldiers of the army training clearly for logistics and to condition the public for military operations domestically.
[00:44:03.939 --> 00:44:15.490]  This is happening everywhere and they admit in their incorporation documents that we cite that it's part of a societal quote evolution towards the acceptance of a national police force administered by Northcom.
[00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:20.533]  So Northcom really runs it, but Southcom is going to coordinate it.
[00:44:20.533 --> 00:44:21.934]  Joe, it's outrageous.
[00:44:21.934 --> 00:44:28.679]  So as a veteran, and as somebody that's been on the inside of this, what is your breakdown on what's currently happening?
[00:44:28.679 --> 00:44:32.161]  Well, like you said earlier in the broadcast, Alex, we are over the target.
[00:44:32.161 --> 00:44:36.204]  They are shooting at us on all fronts now because we have essentially hit a nerve.
[00:44:36.664 --> 00:44:39.306]  You know, I expect way more attacks to come.
[00:44:39.306 --> 00:44:43.548]  I'm expecting way more attacks on my own service and what I've done.
[00:44:43.548 --> 00:44:46.190]  I'm sure they're going to be coming out in different articles saying this and that.
[00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:48.031]  But like you said, it's clearly out there.
[00:44:48.031 --> 00:44:51.273]  My record of what I've done is out there for people to see.
[00:44:51.273 --> 00:44:57.957]  It's in Dan Rather Reports, Episode of the Commander, GQ, Obama's War, Men's Journal.
[00:44:57.957 --> 00:45:03.541]  All these different things show what I've done in my service, and yet they want to come and attack us and say that I'm sighted.
[00:45:04.683 --> 00:45:08.607]  That's the one thing that just really pisses me off that they're gonna go and say that I'm sighted.
[00:45:08.607 --> 00:45:12.250]  No, no, no, I am a retired Army Staff Sergeant.
[00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:14.031]  So, I mean, that's the end of the point with that.
[00:45:14.031 --> 00:45:23.059]  But I mean, this pisses me off to know that they're gonna go and attack us because we're exposing the fact that they're trying to condition people to go along with this BS.
[00:45:24.471 --> 00:45:25.312]  It's disgusting.
[00:45:25.312 --> 00:45:32.319]  And like you said, the people who are leaking this stuff to us are soldiers in the military because they see what's going on is wrong.
[00:45:32.319 --> 00:45:33.220]  They want to get it out there.
[00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:34.381]  They know they can't do it.
[00:45:34.381 --> 00:45:37.043]  So they use people like us because they know we're going to do the right thing.
[00:45:37.043 --> 00:45:38.384]  Well, that's exactly what's going on.
[00:45:38.384 --> 00:45:44.751]  And more importantly, the people on the outside, they're assessing the officers, the enlisted, the non-commissioned.
[00:45:44.751 --> 00:45:47.894]  They're assessing for future purges.
[00:45:47.894 --> 00:45:48.634]  This is already going on.
[00:45:49.395 --> 00:45:54.757]  Who is playing ball in the Navy SEALs, the Delta Force, the Marines, the Army Rangers?
[00:45:54.757 --> 00:45:56.978]  That's what this is, is an assessment.
[00:45:56.978 --> 00:46:02.380]  And they're going to have domestic groups, guys in plain clothes driving around, pulling all sorts of stuff.
[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:04.901]  I used to go out and cover these events when Clinton was trying this.
[00:46:04.901 --> 00:46:05.781]  See, they've tried before.
[00:46:07.062 --> 00:46:08.083]  And the military rejected it.
[00:46:08.083 --> 00:46:09.964]  That's how I learned about this.
[00:46:09.964 --> 00:46:12.125]  Police and military rejected it, Joe.
[00:46:12.125 --> 00:46:16.507]  And we would go out and had them break in our hotel rooms, pull guns on us.
[00:46:16.507 --> 00:46:22.470]  They had an army guy start setting fires in Florida, trying to blame it on us.
[00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:23.471]  I mean, let me explain, folks.
[00:46:23.471 --> 00:46:29.194]  This is dangerous to cover this, because this is the globalists trying to run a psy-op on the military.
[00:46:32.301 --> 00:46:35.324]  Yeah, I mean, this is completely and totally out of control.
[00:46:35.324 --> 00:46:42.912]  And if you notice, in the articles they go, well, they show these slides where it states that they say that the operators will be conducting suspicious activity.
[00:46:42.912 --> 00:46:46.376]  They never go, no, that's not what it, we didn't say that.
[00:46:46.376 --> 00:46:48.018]  They just say that we're stating that.
[00:46:48.018 --> 00:46:50.700]  Like I said, they keep changing, they keep moving the attention away.
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:54.905]  They never once deny the fact that those slides exist and that all the stuff written in it is real.
[00:46:55.225 --> 00:46:58.567]  And there's going to be real training to stop terrorists blowing up power plants.
[00:46:58.567 --> 00:47:01.208]  There's going to be real training for Afghanistan.
[00:47:01.208 --> 00:47:05.510]  Because I've been to, no exaggeration, 30 or 40 of these, and my crew's been to more than that.
[00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:14.294]  But inside of that, they're going to have missions to take over courthouses and capitals, and have nighttime raids, and snatch and grabs, and to take out the states.
[00:47:15.054 --> 00:47:16.716]  Well, a mission just ended with the U.S.
[00:47:16.716 --> 00:47:20.840]  Army soldiers from the 202 Military Intelligence Battalion in Salt Lake City, Utah.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:26.205]  They were conducting scenario-based surveillance, either dismounted, walking, or mounted driving.
[00:47:26.205 --> 00:47:30.729]  Dressed in civilian clothes, walking through the seats doing the surveillance spy.
[00:47:31.850 --> 00:47:46.760]  My dad's uncle just died two years ago and I mean he was an army officer and after that got recruited to the CIA and all he told my dad was, he's dead now, but my dad knew about it, was that he basically was a hitman for the CIA.
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:48.601]  That's who they recruit is army officers.
[00:47:48.601 --> 00:47:51.363]  But they just sit here and act like this has never been going on.
[00:47:51.363 --> 00:47:53.465]  They just play stupid Joe and I'm sick of it.
[00:47:53.465 --> 00:47:58.708]  But now they're not training army officers to say take out Russian spies in Chicago.
[00:47:58.708 --> 00:48:00.870]  The kind of stuff that my dad's uncle would do.
[00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:04.872]  They're training to take on the Tea Party with hit teams.
[00:48:04.872 --> 00:48:06.092]  And that's illegal.
[00:48:06.092 --> 00:48:07.093]  We're gonna talk about it.
[00:48:07.093 --> 00:48:07.973]  Well, they know we're right.
[00:48:07.973 --> 00:48:10.555]  That's why they keep calling us conspiracy groups.
[00:48:10.555 --> 00:48:22.661]  Because years ago when we talked about the phones spying on you, but the phones having the backdoor to the NSA, when we said that the TVs were listening to you, when we said all this was going on, they said we were crazy, they said we're conspiracy theorists, and now it's all come out.
[00:48:22.661 --> 00:48:26.363]  It's just like, unless Snopes writes about it or if it's on Fox, it's not true.
[00:48:26.363 --> 00:48:28.565]  But we all know now that that's what's going on.
[00:48:28.565 --> 00:48:30.806]  When Michael Hastings got hit, his car blew up.
[00:48:31.266 --> 00:48:33.228]  We said that there was... He said, I'm running, they're coming at me.
[00:48:33.228 --> 00:48:34.989]  You talked to his friends, and they killed him.
[00:48:34.989 --> 00:48:38.913]  And we said it's possible that a car could be hacked, taken over, and something like that could happen.
[00:48:38.913 --> 00:48:39.914]  No, you guys are crazy.
[00:48:39.914 --> 00:48:41.135]  You're out of your mind.
[00:48:41.135 --> 00:48:43.317]  Now it's all over mainstream media, and it's okay.
[00:48:43.317 --> 00:48:48.622]  Now they kind of forget the fact that they bashed us the entire time, and now we're kind of like, okay, they let us back in.
[00:48:49.002 --> 00:48:53.866]  And then now we come out talking about this, but wonder how they're going to feel in about five years when they're all locked up.
[00:48:53.866 --> 00:48:56.187]  Well, Hastings became a total patriot.
[00:48:56.187 --> 00:49:01.911]  His wife's obviously a high-level spy working at the National Security Council in the actual Star Chamber.
[00:49:01.911 --> 00:49:05.834]  And Hastings, as you said, was in a lot of battles with you, wasn't scared at all compared to other media.
[00:49:05.834 --> 00:49:08.596]  He was the bravest journalist I'd ever seen in combat.
[00:49:08.596 --> 00:49:11.018]  And that's why he got all those powerful reports.
[00:49:11.018 --> 00:49:18.443]  He went on TV and said, evil's taken over, Republicans and Democrats are run, the nation's going under tyranny, we have to declare war on this, and they killed him.
[00:49:21.124 --> 00:49:26.288]  I mean- And they could kill us tomorrow, and don't say that we crashed the car, folks, or that we killed ourselves.
[00:49:26.288 --> 00:49:27.328]  It's not true.
[00:49:27.328 --> 00:49:30.110]  And we're not whining, we're not worried about it, we're doing the right thing here.
[00:49:30.110 --> 00:49:35.774]  There's no way we could just back down from this, but to watch them sit there and deny this is going on.
[00:49:35.774 --> 00:49:37.075]  They've got a problem, Joe.
[00:49:37.075 --> 00:49:39.137]  You talk to the military, I talk to the military.
[00:49:39.137 --> 00:49:40.918]  Almost all of them are awake to what's going on.
[00:49:41.078 --> 00:49:42.719]  Oh yeah, it's not the soldiers you have to worry about.
[00:49:42.719 --> 00:49:44.440]  It's not the lower enlisted guys.
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:50.722]  It's the ones who've been in there for years and years, who are basically politicians at this point, working at the Pentagon, things like that.
[00:49:50.722 --> 00:49:51.823]  Those are the ones you have to worry about.
[00:49:51.823 --> 00:49:57.446]  It's not your everyday private to Sergeant First Class, Master Sergeant type ranks you've got to worry about.
[00:49:57.446 --> 00:49:59.847]  These are the guys who are just basically trying to make a living.
[00:49:59.847 --> 00:50:06.710]  They want to get out, do their time, take care of their family, go out, go home, go shoot guns, have a barbecue, you know, just live the American life.
[00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:08.251]  They're not out there.
[00:50:08.251 --> 00:50:11.293]  And now they've been listed as the number one enemy when they have the takeover.
[00:50:11.293 --> 00:50:16.677]  The Pentagon can't get around the hundreds of documents saying that they're going to target the vets.
[00:50:16.677 --> 00:50:17.498]  Well, it's another thing, too.
[00:50:17.498 --> 00:50:29.827]  A lot of my friends who are wanting to get out are now scared to get out and are willing to re-enlist for another 10 years or so to finish off their, to get their retirement because they know that the VA is so bad, they know that they're not going to be taken care of, that they have depression problems.
[00:50:29.827 --> 00:50:34.670]  They know that they've had problems with drug addiction when it comes to Percocets and things like that.
[00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:35.551]  These are problems created by...
[00:50:35.811 --> 00:50:36.191]  What are you doing?
[00:50:36.191 --> 00:50:39.375]  Are you finally getting any medical treatment for all your shrapnel and stuff now?
[00:50:39.375 --> 00:50:40.876]  No, I just don't even worry about it.
[00:50:40.876 --> 00:50:42.178]  I just stopped going to the VA.
[00:50:42.178 --> 00:50:43.999]  At this point in time, it really doesn't matter.
[00:50:43.999 --> 00:50:46.862]  I just, I leave it alone and I don't take anything.
[00:50:46.862 --> 00:50:49.225]  Are you still coughing up blood?
[00:50:49.225 --> 00:50:57.994]  That hasn't happened in a while, but I mean, I've kind of calmed down a lot of the stuff and started looking at a lot of the intake of what I was drinking or eating to kind of cut back on that to minimize it.
[00:50:57.994 --> 00:50:58.374]  Good job.
[00:50:58.374 --> 00:50:58.955]  We're gonna be right back.
[00:50:59.983 --> 00:51:02.844]  This hour of GCN, brought to you by Lissig.

[00:51:29.998 --> 00:51:31.159]  It's happening again.
[00:51:31.159 --> 00:51:34.780]  The Feds are trying to ban your freedom to own body armor.
[00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:38.202]  In January, a newly introduced bill, H.R.
[00:51:38.202 --> 00:51:42.264]  378, will take away your right to buy level 3 and higher body armor.
[00:51:42.264 --> 00:51:47.766]  Katie Armor offers the most affordable level 3 body armor packages on the market today.
[00:51:47.766 --> 00:51:48.867]  Protect yourself.

[00:51:55.570 --> 00:51:56.570]  Come and take it.
[00:51:59.278 --> 00:52:00.239]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:52:00.239 --> 00:52:00.799]  Good, brother.
[00:52:00.799 --> 00:52:02.761]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:52:02.761 --> 00:52:04.482]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:52:04.482 --> 00:52:08.505]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:52:08.505 --> 00:52:11.128]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:52:11.128 --> 00:52:13.550]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:21.516]  Super Mel Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:52:21.756 --> 00:52:24.960]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:26.502]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:52:26.502 --> 00:52:29.425]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[00:52:29.425 --> 00:52:31.187]  Saving a ton of money there.
[00:52:31.187 --> 00:52:36.613]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[00:52:36.613 --> 00:52:37.373]  We're good to go.
[00:52:59.002 --> 00:53:00.403]  Hey, sorry I'm running late.
[00:53:00.403 --> 00:53:02.544]  I had to stop and get my vitamins for the month.
[00:53:02.544 --> 00:53:05.865]  I got mine in the mail yesterday from DiscountNutritionShop.com.
[00:53:05.865 --> 00:53:08.126]  So I'm here, totally on time.
[00:53:08.126 --> 00:53:10.227]  DiscountNutritionShop.com?

[00:53:18.011 --> 00:53:18.811]  Write down this number.

[00:53:19.111 --> 00:53:19.211]  Huh?
[00:53:19.211 --> 00:53:19.271]  888-908-4548.

[00:53:51.763 --> 00:53:52.743]  Onesilversolution.com.
[00:53:52.743 --> 00:53:54.445]  There is only One Silver Solution.
[00:54:12.009 --> 00:54:15.053]  I was a prisoner of doubt.
[00:54:15.053 --> 00:54:20.099]  Well, there is no doubt that the globalists have accelerated their takeover.
[00:54:21.605 --> 00:54:23.345]  300% last year?
[00:54:23.345 --> 00:54:25.806]  That's my real guesstimate, 300%.
[00:54:25.806 --> 00:54:46.270]  All hell is breaking loose, and the real psyop here is they're putting the military and the police in unconstitutional missions that are going to demonize them with the people, and then the globalists don't get the blame and sit there and deny it's going on, or then offer reforms that actually give them even more power over the police and military.
[00:54:47.682 --> 00:54:52.805]  So we owe it to the military to not let them be used in this treasonous way.
[00:54:52.805 --> 00:54:53.565]  And again, I'll say it.
[00:54:53.565 --> 00:54:55.026]  The most await group is the military.
[00:54:55.026 --> 00:54:56.206]  Next is the police.
[00:54:56.206 --> 00:54:58.568]  And the police have some of the biggest problems out there.
[00:54:58.568 --> 00:54:59.868]  But that's how the world works.
[00:54:59.868 --> 00:55:00.829]  It's usually a paradox.
[00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:04.971]  Like America is the world's hope or the world's damnation.
[00:55:04.971 --> 00:55:09.153]  The military and the police are our hope or our damnation.
[00:55:09.153 --> 00:55:10.254]  That's how it works.
[00:55:10.254 --> 00:55:12.595]  You are the hope, listeners, or our damnation.
[00:55:14.232 --> 00:55:15.293]  You are the resistance.
[00:55:15.293 --> 00:55:16.455]  You are the answer.
[00:55:16.455 --> 00:55:17.436]  America is great.
[00:55:17.436 --> 00:55:19.218]  America has been special.
[00:55:19.218 --> 00:55:22.002]  America was given providence.
[00:55:22.002 --> 00:55:24.425]  George Washington and our founders were amazing.
[00:55:24.425 --> 00:55:25.867]  They did change the world.
[00:55:25.867 --> 00:55:28.490]  Do we just let the globalists usurp that?
[00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:30.472]  And use a bunch of fancy propaganda on us?
[00:55:30.472 --> 00:55:31.353]  Look around you!
[00:55:32.421 --> 00:55:36.503]  Tyranny is accelerating and they're going to target everyone.
[00:55:36.503 --> 00:55:42.285]  They put tyrannies in place to rob populations, to make you poor, to conquer you.
[00:55:42.285 --> 00:55:45.627]  Globalists want to conquer nations and enslave.
[00:55:45.627 --> 00:55:49.009]  Our founders wanted wealth and power and prestige.
[00:55:49.009 --> 00:55:50.889]  They believed in humanity.
[00:55:50.889 --> 00:55:54.151]  It's a renaissance economy or a conquering economy.
[00:55:55.387 --> 00:55:56.950]  We've become an empire.
[00:55:56.950 --> 00:56:02.800]  And now the empire is in trouble and it's looking to enslave us domestically.
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:06.407]  Because the empire is meant to fall into the larger global government empire.
[00:56:07.947 --> 00:56:13.370]  And they're telling those in the American empire, set up this police state, purge your people, and you'll run the empire.
[00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:15.792]  But in truth, they're going to be set up in the end as well.
[00:56:15.792 --> 00:56:18.774]  David Rockefeller and Brzezinski have written books!
[00:56:18.774 --> 00:56:21.395]  It's a plan to triple cross!
[00:56:21.395 --> 00:56:25.598]  So I know a lot of military brass, others that go, yeah, we're an empire, big deal, the world's rough.
[00:56:25.598 --> 00:56:28.319]  Yeah, we do evil stuff, but be glad it's us, not somebody else.
[00:56:28.319 --> 00:56:31.101]  We're gonna run it here from the top, and it'll be alright, Jones.
[00:56:31.101 --> 00:56:32.642]  Why do you think he's still alive?
[00:56:32.642 --> 00:56:34.103]  You ought to really join us.
[00:56:34.103 --> 00:56:37.025]  I've been told this by famous, you name it, you've heard some of them on the show.
[00:56:37.825 --> 00:56:44.490]  And, but off record, trying to get me to join them, and I'm just like, look long term, this is going to end up screwing everybody.
[00:56:44.490 --> 00:56:47.213]  Getting rid of due process is like the ring of Mordor.
[00:56:47.213 --> 00:56:49.034]  It will bite you in the butt every time.
[00:56:49.034 --> 00:56:51.296]  I will not be part of this.
[00:56:51.296 --> 00:56:56.800]  Joe Biggs, again, what do you make of the massive rollout of TSA on the streets?
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:57:00.043]  Military popping up everywhere, TSA popping up.
[00:57:00.043 --> 00:57:01.764]  What do you think they're building towards, Joe?
[00:57:01.764 --> 00:57:03.806]  Why do you think they're accelerating the power grab?
[00:57:04.315 --> 00:57:05.639]  What was it like with the 10-33 program?
[00:57:05.639 --> 00:57:07.966]  They're bringing all this military gear in, dumping it off.
[00:57:09.306 --> 00:57:13.327]  And do I really think that they want these police departments and fire departments to really use them?
[00:57:13.327 --> 00:57:18.608]  No, it's almost like the mentality when you're back in garrison in the army.
[00:57:18.608 --> 00:57:26.550]  You let the privates take care of the equipment and when it's time to go train and actually do an exercise, or to actually use it in combat, then you get to go play with the toy.
[00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:31.251]  The government's dumping off all this stuff strategically, placing it all across- Letting locals pay for the upkeep.
[00:57:31.251 --> 00:57:33.872]  Yes, let them pay for the upkeep, let them do the maintenance.
[00:57:34.432 --> 00:57:49.543]  All that makes sure everything's fine, and when it's time that they want to come in, they take it over, they will use it, they will be the ones running up and down the street, driving the MRAPs, and they'll be essentially pushing the police aside, making them do smaller tasks, but the government will be the ones who run in and- The police will be like interns.
[00:57:49.543 --> 00:57:49.683]  Yeah.
[00:57:50.862 --> 00:57:57.728]  They're the ones who are doing the stuff now, the no-knock raids, all this, feeling like, hey, I'm gonna, you know, this is gonna pay off one day.
[00:57:57.728 --> 00:57:59.169]  But it's not going to.
[00:57:59.169 --> 00:58:01.171]  You know, all this stuff that they're doing right now is horrible.
[00:58:01.171 --> 00:58:03.233]  No-knock raids are the worst thing ever.
[00:58:03.233 --> 00:58:05.535]  And then on top of that, you start adding these MRAPs to it.
[00:58:05.535 --> 00:58:07.417]  You're rolling up, you're scaring the hell out of people.
[00:58:07.417 --> 00:58:10.340]  They're expanding and quadrupling the size of SWAT teams.
[00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:16.225]  I mean, they're doing warrant service now just on marijuana stuff with armored vehicles and middle-of-the-night stuff.
[00:58:16.225 --> 00:58:17.106]  It's a terror force.
[00:58:17.586 --> 00:58:18.427]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:58:18.427 --> 00:58:23.009]  I mean, you've got to think, most people have some kind of firearm at their home.
[00:58:23.009 --> 00:58:26.591]  And what's anyone's reaction going to be when they hear a busting down of their door?
[00:58:26.591 --> 00:58:27.932]  To shoot!
[00:58:27.932 --> 00:58:32.315]  And then they use that against, they go, well, this guy, this suspect shot a cop in the face.
[00:58:32.315 --> 00:58:35.136]  Yeah, during a no-knock raid.
[00:58:35.136 --> 00:58:38.559]  Because you're not a criminal, you're not expecting to be hit by a death squad.
[00:58:38.559 --> 00:58:40.340]  We'll be back, stay with us.
[00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:43.962]  I mean, there's a need for small SWAT teams, but they're just turning them into huge
[00:58:45.235 --> 00:58:46.622]  It's a takeover.
[00:58:46.622 --> 00:58:47.647]  It's Rand Corporation.
[00:58:47.647 --> 00:58:47.948]  Set it.
[00:58:47.948 --> 00:58:48.350]  We'll be back.
[00:58:49.952 --> 00:58:53.434]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:58:53.434 --> 00:59:01.679]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:01.679 --> 00:59:07.103]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:59:07.103 --> 00:59:09.624]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:59:52.069 --> 01:00:06.157]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:06.157 --> 01:00:07.458]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.458 --> 01:00:09.239]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:09.239 --> 01:00:11.000]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.581]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.581 --> 01:00:13.461]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.461 --> 01:00:14.662]  It's Alex Jones, folks!
[01:00:14.662 --> 01:00:17.704]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:24.064]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.064 --> 01:00:33.551]  Coming up, Texas City pushes back against Sharia law, and the Islamists were protesting it.
[01:00:33.551 --> 01:00:37.134]  Rand Paul says he's the only one that can beat Hillary Clinton.
[01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:39.295]  I do think overall he's a better candidate than Ted Cruz.
[01:00:39.295 --> 01:00:43.959]  Man, Ted Cruz is really, I like what he's saying.
[01:00:43.959 --> 01:00:46.721]  Monsanto hit with fine for genetically contaminated wheat supply.
[01:00:47.321 --> 01:00:48.822]  We're going to look at this new article out.
[01:00:48.822 --> 01:00:51.244]  It's on DrugsReport.com, unindependent.
[01:00:51.244 --> 01:00:53.685]  Angelina Jolie has ovaries removed.
[01:00:53.685 --> 01:00:58.308]  I know my children will never have to say mom died of ovarian cancer.
[01:00:58.308 --> 01:01:00.410]  They're telling you everybody's getting cancer because of genetics.
[01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:05.033]  No, you're predisposed when you go into certain toxins to then trigger the cancer.
[01:01:06.555 --> 01:01:14.722]  And we've got Dr. Joel Wallach joining us to talk about his best-selling book that we sell, TheInfoWarStore.com, Epigenetics, and more today.
[01:01:14.722 --> 01:01:16.844]  But, Joel, I've been ranting here.
[01:01:16.844 --> 01:01:22.828]  What is it like for you to go from being in Stars and Stripes or Army Times, you know, as a hero,
[01:01:24.029 --> 01:01:28.432]  Uh, and then now they're saying, we don't even know he was in the military, you know, basically implying that.
[01:01:28.432 --> 01:01:37.318]  Uh, and then basically saying we're liars and anti-military because we don't want the military being used for domestic takeovers, which they admit they've gotten rid of Posse Comitatus.
[01:01:37.318 --> 01:01:39.319]  I mean, this is hiding in plain view.
[01:01:39.319 --> 01:01:41.701]  Your buddy calls up and says, yeah, we're running a PSYOP.
[01:01:41.701 --> 01:01:42.521]  Stay out of it, Joe.
[01:01:42.521 --> 01:01:44.222]  I mean, there's this arrogance.
[01:01:44.222 --> 01:01:46.484]  It's just, I mean, folks, this is serious.
[01:01:46.484 --> 01:01:47.785]  This is not about protecting us.
[01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:54.932]  Yeah, he was saying that, he said, stop putting out your propaganda videos, it's going to ruin our psy-op.
[01:01:54.932 --> 01:01:57.072]  Just plain and simple, right there.
[01:01:57.072 --> 01:02:00.693]  Comes out, I'm like, alright, why do you keep attacking me on it?
[01:02:00.693 --> 01:02:01.714]  So he keeps hitting me.
[01:02:01.714 --> 01:02:04.655]  Now we have the Army Times, we have all these people.
[01:02:04.655 --> 01:02:06.955]  If it was nothing, they wouldn't talk about it.
[01:02:06.955 --> 01:02:08.416]  If it's something that's nothing, what happens?
[01:02:08.416 --> 01:02:10.076]  People just sweep it under the rug and move on.
[01:02:10.076 --> 01:02:15.698]  That's how you know we're over the target, we're talking about this in a manner that is
[01:02:16.872 --> 01:02:19.133]  Got so calm and everyone just so uptight.
[01:02:19.133 --> 01:02:21.514]  They're like, all right, these guys know about this.
[01:02:21.514 --> 01:02:22.314]  People are going to wake up.
[01:02:22.314 --> 01:02:23.594]  People are going to find out what's going on.
[01:02:23.594 --> 01:02:26.275]  All right, let's just start ramping up the propaganda against them.
[01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:27.415]  Let's call them conspiracy theorists.
[01:02:27.415 --> 01:02:28.416]  Let's call them crazy.
[01:02:28.416 --> 01:02:30.176]  Let's say that, you know, they weren't in the military.
[01:02:30.176 --> 01:02:30.816]  Let's do all this.
[01:02:30.816 --> 01:02:32.217]  There's going to be more attacks.
[01:02:32.217 --> 01:02:32.697]  But guess what?
[01:02:32.697 --> 01:02:38.579]  There's so many military people out there I know each and every day who have our backs and who will stand up and do the right thing.
[01:02:39.119 --> 01:02:42.222]  That's right, and the more they lie, the more they lose credibility.
[01:02:42.222 --> 01:02:47.966]  I mean, the military knows that there's unprecedented riot training and gun confiscation training going on.
[01:02:47.966 --> 01:02:48.727]  It's all over the news.
[01:02:48.727 --> 01:02:49.828]  There's cities all over Texas.
[01:02:49.828 --> 01:02:52.710]  They just say we're full of it because we say it's a bad idea.
[01:02:52.710 --> 01:03:01.377]  There's cities all over Texas right now popping up on their websites, like San Angelo today, for instance, came out saying that they will accept the SOCOM's
[01:03:02.942 --> 01:03:03.942]  I don't know.
[01:03:20.689 --> 01:03:26.335]  He said they came to us, it's in preparation for a domestic takeover, and to see who will go along with it.
[01:03:26.335 --> 01:03:29.338]  And then I was told by the police chief of San Antonio on video.
[01:03:29.338 --> 01:03:31.681]  It's not like they've been trying this forever, Joe.
[01:03:31.681 --> 01:03:33.383]  The good news is we're holding it back.
[01:03:33.383 --> 01:03:34.164]  Yeah.
[01:03:34.164 --> 01:03:34.604]  Go ahead.
[01:03:34.604 --> 01:03:38.849]  Just west of Abilene, they came out, there's a city, can't remember what it's called, like Howard County, something like that.
[01:03:39.605 --> 01:03:44.510]  Where they said they've already accepted the invitation as well, and there's going to be a lot of airborne operations going on.
[01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:48.514]  So troops jumping out of planes like Red Dawn, coming in, landing in your backyard.
[01:03:48.514 --> 01:03:51.858]  That's going to scare the living hell out of people, knowing that this is going on.
[01:03:51.858 --> 01:03:53.499]  Why can't you do this on your own base?
[01:03:53.499 --> 01:03:55.702]  We have installations that are built for training.
[01:03:55.702 --> 01:03:58.585]  They have Fort Hood that's like a 10th of Texas.
[01:03:58.585 --> 01:04:00.326]  But that's how you know it's a PSYOP.
[01:04:01.067 --> 01:04:01.387]  Why?
[01:04:01.387 --> 01:04:07.033]  We have so much money we've dumped into these training facilities all over America on these giant bases.
[01:04:07.033 --> 01:04:10.737]  If we're not going to use them, what's the point?
[01:04:10.737 --> 01:04:11.637]  Why do we need to bring this?
[01:04:11.637 --> 01:04:16.262]  Well, they admit it's for a PSYOP to identify, they say in the document, who will work with them.
[01:04:16.262 --> 01:04:20.666]  I mean, are you going to be working with the Abilene or the San Angelo police in Afghanistan?
[01:04:20.666 --> 01:04:20.886]  No!
[01:04:21.889 --> 01:04:23.290]  I mean, this is out of control.
[01:04:23.290 --> 01:04:24.571]  I mean, I can't stand it.
[01:04:24.571 --> 01:04:29.954]  The Austin SWAT team got secretly trained a few years ago at Fort Hood to quote, take out terrorists.
[01:04:29.954 --> 01:04:32.035]  And then we learned part of the training was Tea Party.
[01:04:32.035 --> 01:04:35.778]  The military is training the police to kill real Americans.
[01:04:35.778 --> 01:04:37.919]  It's treason.
[01:04:37.919 --> 01:04:39.900]  It is treason, Joe.
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:40.961]  It's just sickening.
[01:04:40.961 --> 01:04:44.243]  But plus, Joe, you were in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[01:04:44.243 --> 01:04:46.405]  I mean, can you imagine you guys
[01:04:47.435 --> 01:04:50.277]  Because they wouldn't actually let you win because it was really just a big money making operation.
[01:04:50.277 --> 01:04:54.139]  Can you imagine actually having to fight the American people?
[01:04:54.139 --> 01:04:56.080]  That would be the hardest battle ever.
[01:04:57.079 --> 01:05:00.321]  There's a lot of true patriots out there who are not going to back down.
[01:05:27.402 --> 01:05:28.369]  Just won't quit.
[01:05:29.778 --> 01:05:33.300]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:41.543]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:05:41.543 --> 01:05:46.965]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:05:46.965 --> 01:05:49.486]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:05:49.486 --> 01:05:51.607]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[01:06:00.529 --> 01:06:01.089]  Good, brother.
[01:06:01.089 --> 01:06:02.830]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:06:02.830 --> 01:06:04.751]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:06:04.751 --> 01:06:08.793]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:06:08.793 --> 01:06:11.394]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:06:11.394 --> 01:06:13.836]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.

[01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:25.124]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:06:25.124 --> 01:06:26.786]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:06:26.786 --> 01:06:29.829]  We've gotten off the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:31.471]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:06:31.471 --> 01:06:36.817]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[01:06:36.817 --> 01:06:58.264]  Concentrated or maximum potency they want to stunned and dumbed down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while But then burn you out in my experience where a stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source So it's pretty exciting and I love it visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife
[01:06:59.631 --> 01:07:09.118]  Infowarslife and Infowarslife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[01:07:09.118 --> 01:07:13.801]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.

[01:07:18.605 --> 01:07:21.647]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[01:07:21.647 --> 01:07:24.069]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[01:07:24.069 --> 01:07:27.431]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[01:07:27.611 --> 01:07:31.492]  Winter Sun is the result of our pursuit of the best source of vitamin D3.
[01:07:31.492 --> 01:07:40.556]  The research and development took over two years, but the result, as verified by independent laboratories, is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.
[01:07:40.556 --> 01:07:45.578]  Read the facts at InfoWarsLife.com about Winter Sun vitamin D3.
[01:07:45.578 --> 01:07:51.140]  Not only does vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood, but vitamin D supports our memory and brain function.
[01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.642]  Something the globalists are targeting.
[01:07:53.642 --> 01:07:56.343]  Visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[01:07:56.343 --> 01:07:57.804]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:57.804 --> 01:08:01.967]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.692 --> 01:08:22.800]  Well, Angelina Jolie has come out and said she not only had her breasts removed, but now she's having her ovaries removed because of a predisposition to get cancer.
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:30.667]  Well, we happen to have one of the leading experts who discovered this information with the federal government, one of the largest autopsy programs ever recorded.
[01:08:31.730 --> 01:08:35.271]  Joel Wallach, BSDVM, MD.
[01:08:35.271 --> 01:08:38.992]  He was working in zoological research when he discovered this.
[01:08:38.992 --> 01:08:44.413]  And it's also written with some other MDs and PhDs.
[01:08:44.413 --> 01:08:50.095]  Ma Lan and Gerhard N. Schrosner, PhD.
[01:08:50.095 --> 01:08:51.535]  And it goes on from there.
[01:08:51.535 --> 01:08:55.456]  Epigenetics, the death of the genetic theory of disease transmission.
[01:08:55.456 --> 01:08:59.177]  We sell the book at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsHealth.com.
[01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:05.244]  And the forward is by Jeffrey S. Bland, PhD.
[01:09:05.244 --> 01:09:09.467]  This is such key information, especially with what Angelina Jolie is getting into.
[01:09:09.467 --> 01:09:12.390]  This is some of the big secrets they don't want folks to know about.
[01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:18.475]  Then we're going to get in to robots to replace almost half of jobs over the next 20 years.
[01:09:18.475 --> 01:09:20.277]  That's out of the Brisbane Times.
[01:09:20.277 --> 01:09:27.903]  That dovetails with one of the founders of Apple, Steve Wozniak, saying the future of artificial intelligence is scary and very bad for people.
[01:09:29.082 --> 01:09:35.205]  We're going to get into record cold temperatures, continue another month of record cold, but reasons to be optimistic.
[01:09:35.205 --> 01:09:49.152]  This is our supposed global warming, report Israel spied on Iran, nuke talks, Apple soon to be a one trillion dollar company, and we've got a bunch of news on the illegals and the borders being wide open, but putting an end cap here,
[01:09:50.396 --> 01:10:00.499]  Or bookends on what we just spent a lot of the last hour on, The Anatomy of a Psy-Op, Stars and Stripes, Army Times, Bloomberg, Newsweek, Vice.
[01:10:00.499 --> 01:10:02.319]  They attacked us too?
[01:10:02.319 --> 01:10:03.159]  Today.
[01:10:03.159 --> 01:10:04.800]  Really?
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:09.681]  Everybody under the sun is attacking Infowars.com and saying, ridiculous!
[01:10:09.681 --> 01:10:17.523]  They claim they're militarizing the police, they claim there's a domestic takeover plan, they claim the Army is going to invade
[01:10:19.196 --> 01:10:20.817]  Uh, Texas can take it over the summer.
[01:10:20.817 --> 01:10:21.938]  No, we didn't say that.
[01:10:21.938 --> 01:10:25.881]  We said they're training to invade it, listing it as hostile.
[01:10:25.881 --> 01:10:35.448]  They threatened two years ago to use, as Associated Press, air blockades of F-16s Obama did if this legislature passed a law banning the TSA groping children.
[01:10:36.004 --> 01:10:40.085]  The House passed unanimously, they said we're going to blockade your airlines, so they shot it down in the Senate.
[01:10:40.085 --> 01:10:42.146]  I mean, that was in the news.
[01:10:42.146 --> 01:10:52.608]  And we have a special report on InfoWars.com, red-linked, where I show all the documents, the Rand Corporation, the Pentagon announcement, where they say veterans and gun owners are NORTHCOM's main job.
[01:10:52.608 --> 01:10:54.409]  I mean, this is all over the news.
[01:10:54.409 --> 01:10:56.189]  We're the ones that broke it.
[01:10:56.189 --> 01:10:59.170]  Army and MSM launched this InfoSop against American people.
[01:11:00.214 --> 01:11:10.282]  This is happening and they don't want us, just like they said there was no death panels in Obamacare, or just like they said there weren't death panels in the VA now admitted, or that it didn't increase your prices when it did, or didn't get rid of your doctor.
[01:11:10.282 --> 01:11:12.224]  They lie until it's in place.
[01:11:12.224 --> 01:11:14.286]  They don't want to debate about this now.
[01:11:14.286 --> 01:11:18.089]  Just like they'd say anthrax shots aren't killing the troops in 2001.
[01:11:18.089 --> 01:11:20.431]  And then they later admitted it was deadly and quit it.
[01:11:20.431 --> 01:11:21.872]  We were called kooks then.
[01:11:21.872 --> 01:11:23.834]  So we're not even defending ourselves.
[01:11:23.834 --> 01:11:28.638]  This is a good thing they're attacking us, but imagine a civil war in America that they want to start
[01:11:29.701 --> 01:11:32.562]  It's tearing up people against the police, all of this.
[01:11:32.562 --> 01:11:35.563]  Joe Biggs, as a veteran, I mean, what do you make of this?
[01:11:35.563 --> 01:11:39.524]  And what would happen if there was a real civil war in America?
[01:11:39.524 --> 01:11:42.925]  Obviously, that wouldn't be very good at first.
[01:11:42.925 --> 01:11:51.667]  But you've got to think, like I said before, the lower soldiers, the guys who are in there, you know, right out of high school, out of college, they're not the ones you've got to worry about.
[01:11:51.667 --> 01:11:52.748]  It's the ones at the Pentagon.
[01:11:52.748 --> 01:11:54.688]  It's the people up there who are in the politics.
[01:11:54.688 --> 01:11:57.009]  They're the ones who work with the, you know, the big money.
[01:11:57.509 --> 01:12:00.471]  Those are the ones you have to worry about to make those kind of decisions.
[01:12:00.471 --> 01:12:02.572]  And this is the thing, this is part of the PSYOP.
[01:12:02.572 --> 01:12:08.115]  How are we as civilians going to know when this is a mission or a training exercise?
[01:12:08.115 --> 01:12:08.676]  That's right.
[01:12:08.676 --> 01:12:14.840]  And then when are the soldiers going to know the difference between a training exercise and, hey, all of a sudden we're actually going out on the streets and being told to do this?
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:16.661]  And that's what they admit it's for.
[01:12:16.661 --> 01:12:25.126]  And if you watch the Charlton Heston piece on History Channel about the Panama invasion, they did the same thing for six months before the real deal there.
[01:12:25.566 --> 01:12:26.427]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:12:26.427 --> 01:12:28.128]  So that's the thing, that's the PSYOP with us.
[01:12:28.128 --> 01:12:32.032]  It's confusing people to not know when it's going to be a training exercise and an actual mission to do.
[01:12:32.032 --> 01:12:36.736]  And you were told by your buddy from Iraq and Afghanistan, who's now at SOCOM.
[01:12:36.736 --> 01:12:38.217]  Yep, he's down in Tampa, Florida.
[01:12:38.217 --> 01:12:40.138]  He said, yeah, shut up Biggs, it is a PSYOP.
[01:12:40.138 --> 01:12:41.019]  Yep, exactly.
[01:12:41.019 --> 01:12:41.620]  Word for word.
[01:12:43.126 --> 01:12:44.867]  I mean, it's out there, it's in your face.
[01:12:44.867 --> 01:12:46.389]  I mean, there's not more we can do.
[01:12:46.389 --> 01:12:48.330]  We're telling you, we're showing you the documents.
[01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:53.254]  And like I said, SOCOM's not denying that these are real slides, that information's on there.
[01:12:53.254 --> 01:12:56.677]  They're just trying to take the, they're just trying to- Yeah, they now finally admit it.
[01:12:56.677 --> 01:12:59.580]  For four or five days it was, oh, we don't know if it's even real.
[01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:00.600]  Now, okay, it's real.
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:02.242]  And then they misrepresent.
[01:13:02.762 --> 01:13:03.483]  What we're saying.
[01:13:03.483 --> 01:13:10.251]  We have these local cities that are popping up accepting the invitation for Operation Jade Home to go live in their cities.
[01:13:10.251 --> 01:13:16.879]  And by the way guys, if you go to YouTube and type in Alex Jones San Antonio Police Chief or Alex Jones Delta Force, you can see the 30 minute interview.
[01:13:18.069 --> 01:13:22.992]  And the film is 30 minutes, this is actually an hour long, with Ali Philippus, who is in Army Intelligence himself.
[01:13:22.992 --> 01:13:30.356]  Delta Force came in with $200,000 in 1999, 1998 in his office, and said, we want you to work in secret operations with us here locally.
[01:13:30.356 --> 01:13:33.398]  And it was basically narcotics trafficking.
[01:13:33.398 --> 01:13:34.979]  And a bunch, it was Delta Force.
[01:13:34.979 --> 01:13:35.860]  And he said, no way.
[01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:38.742]  Then he found out a bunch of the city officials had taken the money.
[01:13:38.742 --> 01:13:41.183]  Once you take the money, you're now compromised.
[01:13:41.183 --> 01:13:45.666]  They were there in an infiltration op, the same ones you use to buy off third world countries.
[01:13:46.892 --> 01:13:49.837]  Like Guatemala or whatever, they were doing it to them.
[01:13:49.837 --> 01:13:52.181]  Well, it turns out most police chiefs take the money.
[01:13:54.005 --> 01:13:55.226]  Can you believe this, Joe?
[01:13:55.226 --> 01:13:59.269]  Well, like I said, when I was in the military, they would shove Percocet down our throat.
[01:13:59.269 --> 01:14:04.313]  And a lot of people have to have adverse reactions, have to go to these AA meetings type things.
[01:14:04.313 --> 01:14:08.936]  You'd have to go for if you were drunk and got into a fight, which is what happened to me one time.
[01:14:08.936 --> 01:14:10.377]  I had to go to an AA meeting.
[01:14:10.377 --> 01:14:17.743]  And in there was a Delta Force Commando guy who was there because he was caught smuggling heroin from Afghanistan into the States.
[01:14:18.735 --> 01:14:20.275]  So you know what's happening.
[01:14:20.275 --> 01:14:23.036]  You know that since the government's been over there, since the U.S.
[01:14:23.036 --> 01:14:27.877]  Army has been running operations in Afghanistan, that the opium production has gone up like tenfold.
[01:14:27.877 --> 01:14:32.717]  And again, that's who gets in the higher rooms, the guys that will torture, that will deal drugs.
[01:14:32.717 --> 01:14:35.698]  I mean, if you'll do that, you're going to get a big house in Hawaii, Joe.
[01:14:35.698 --> 01:14:37.098]  Mainstream media is not going to cover this stuff.
[01:14:37.098 --> 01:14:38.098]  That's what we do at Infowars.
[01:14:38.098 --> 01:14:42.919]  We cover real topics, and we encourage people to go do the research themselves.
[01:14:42.919 --> 01:14:44.439]  Sure, well, they can't snow job me.
[01:14:44.439 --> 01:14:45.680]  I'm from Texas.
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:47.560]  I mean, it's got to be a third of my family.
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:50.342]  Has been recruited and been in this.
[01:14:50.342 --> 01:14:52.464]  And that's not saying my family is something special.
[01:14:52.464 --> 01:14:59.771]  This underground government is so big that you can't swing a stick in any direction in Texas and not hit somebody that's in this.
[01:14:59.771 --> 01:15:03.794]  We're over the target and they're attacking us and it shows that we're actually getting out and we're reaching people.
[01:15:03.794 --> 01:15:08.399]  Like Daniel's article yesterday showing that we beat ESPN, CBS, all these different people.
[01:15:09.039 --> 01:15:11.462]  In the comments and all that, because we actually spark real issues.
[01:15:11.462 --> 01:15:14.506]  Yeah, we have more ratings than them, more commenters, more traffic.
[01:15:14.506 --> 01:15:15.327]  Exactly!
[01:15:15.327 --> 01:15:17.029]  Because we're really doing something.
[01:15:17.029 --> 01:15:21.854]  We talk about the things that the mainstream media is too scared to, because everything's so politically correct nowadays.
[01:15:21.854 --> 01:15:22.435]  That's what's disgusting.
[01:15:22.435 --> 01:15:26.420]  Well, everybody's scared to get attacked or killed, and I mean, I'm not bending over to this.
[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:28.142]  People need to man up and do something.
[01:15:29.505 --> 01:15:30.726]  I don't bend over for anybody.
[01:15:30.726 --> 01:15:31.666]  I'm sorry.
[01:15:31.666 --> 01:15:32.507]  I'm a fighter.
[01:15:32.507 --> 01:15:33.027]  I don't run.
[01:15:33.027 --> 01:15:34.308]  I'm not going anywhere.
[01:15:34.308 --> 01:15:36.749]  If the country goes to hell, I'm staying here and I'm fighting.
[01:15:36.749 --> 01:15:38.130]  I will not leave.
[01:15:38.130 --> 01:15:38.950]  This is my country.
[01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:39.671]  I will not go anywhere.
[01:15:39.671 --> 01:15:39.931]  Good job, Joe.
[01:15:39.931 --> 01:15:41.392]  That's my attitude as well, brother.
[01:15:41.392 --> 01:15:41.932]  God bless you.
[01:15:41.932 --> 01:15:43.273]  No, you're awesome.
[01:15:43.273 --> 01:15:44.033]  All right.
[01:15:44.033 --> 01:15:45.414]  Joe Biggs, thank you so much.
[01:15:45.414 --> 01:15:45.894]  God bless you.
[01:15:45.894 --> 01:15:48.416]  We're going to keep Dr. Joel Wall at 15 minutes to the next hour.
[01:15:48.416 --> 01:15:52.778]  If he can do it, then we'll cover all the other news and take your calls.
[01:15:52.778 --> 01:15:54.960]  This is another major fight we're about to cover here.
[01:15:56.254 --> 01:16:07.724]  This is so exciting because we know that as cancer goes up 3,000% in breast cancer, 10,000 plus percent in many pediatric cancers or higher, that we know the answer.
[01:16:07.724 --> 01:16:12.168]  It's not that, oh, our genetics suddenly all fell apart so cancer is going off the chart.
[01:16:12.168 --> 01:16:15.310]  20 years ago, 30 years ago, 40 years ago, you couldn't find a kid with cancer.
[01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:18.393]  Now you can't walk down the street and not see kids with cancer.
[01:16:18.393 --> 01:16:20.095]  Why is all of this so epidemic?
[01:16:20.655 --> 01:16:25.880]  Well, it's because, ladies and gentlemen, we're not getting the basic nutrients and vitamins and minerals we need.
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:28.041]  Just like a plant will die if it doesn't happen.
[01:16:28.041 --> 01:16:29.603]  And then your genes break down.
[01:16:29.603 --> 01:16:37.630]  And yes, if you're predisposed to toxins triggering your cancer, then that will basically happen from the mainline research.
[01:16:37.630 --> 01:16:38.390]  They know this.
[01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:43.054]  But they go on the news now and they say, your kid has behavior problems because of bad genes.
[01:16:43.054 --> 01:16:46.958]  Or, get your breasts and ovaries removed or your testicles removed because you might get cancer.
[01:16:47.856 --> 01:16:50.791]  Yes, you have the genetic switch to get that cancer.
[01:16:50.791 --> 01:16:51.213]  We all do.
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:17:04.430]  I mean, you know, the men in my family either lived to be about 89 years old, 79 years old, 82 years old, 95 years old, or they died of about 51 of a giant heart attack.
[01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:07.012]  You make it past that, you live to your 85.
[01:17:07.012 --> 01:17:12.936]  That, genetically, we got big hearts, aggressive, but we have giant heart attacks and just die.
[01:17:12.936 --> 01:17:13.236]  Okay?
[01:17:13.236 --> 01:17:17.279]  That is genetic, but I need to then do things because I'm predisposed not to do that.
[01:17:17.279 --> 01:17:19.181]  We all know I'm not doing those things, so whatever.
[01:17:19.181 --> 01:17:20.142]  I'll take a long dirt nap.
[01:17:20.990 --> 01:17:27.496]  But it's not my genetics, it's that the environment and the way I'm behaving will then make me flip those switches.
[01:17:27.496 --> 01:17:32.400]  Genetics loads the gun, environment pulls the trigger.
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:36.324]  And we have the man who doesn't like to talk about himself, we're going to skip this network break.
[01:17:37.682 --> 01:17:53.431]  Dr. Joel Wallach, he wrote Dead Doctors Don't Lie, his new book, Epigenetics, available at InfoWarsTore.com, is so important, especially in light of Angelina Jolie has ovaries removed, quote, I know my children will never have to say mom died of ovarian cancer.
[01:17:53.431 --> 01:17:54.852]  Well, what if you're predisposed to brain cancer?
[01:17:54.852 --> 01:17:57.013]  Are you going to have your brain removed?
[01:17:57.013 --> 01:18:01.936]  I mean, instead of looking for why the cancer is increasing, we look for how to cure it or medicate it.
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:09.022]  So joining us is Dr. Joel Wallach, and I really appreciate him joining us.
[01:18:09.022 --> 01:18:11.343]  Infowarsteam.com.
[01:18:11.343 --> 01:18:15.565]  I'm in business with him, and he helped found Longevity 18 years ago.
[01:18:15.565 --> 01:18:20.327]  One of the biggest and most successful non-GMO organic companies out there.
[01:18:20.327 --> 01:18:22.147]  Infowarshealth.com, Infowarslife.com.
[01:18:22.147 --> 01:18:23.908]  I'm not going to really infomercial today.
[01:18:23.908 --> 01:18:25.789]  He's all about information, but if you want to get 30% off,

[01:18:40.738 --> 01:18:50.045]  See the videos, the breakdowns, the scientific information, the studies, all there at InfoWarsHealth.com or InfoWarsTeam.com.
[01:18:50.045 --> 01:18:54.828]  Separate from InfoWarsLife.com, those are our supplements, but these are the highest quality,
[01:18:55.148 --> 01:18:58.151]  Beyond Tending to Tangerine 2.0, The Alex Pack, you name it.
[01:18:58.151 --> 01:19:00.073]  But we'll get into that at the end of the interview.
[01:19:00.073 --> 01:19:03.536]  Dr. Joel Wallach joins us.
[01:19:03.536 --> 01:19:13.907]  He, of course, has published numerous books on dietary deficiencies, conducts approximately 300 lectures annually, has sold over 40 million copies of Dead Daughters Don't Lie, Born and Raised in Missouri.
[01:19:13.907 --> 01:19:17.811]  Dr. Wallach attended the University of Missouri and received a bachelor's degree in the science of agriculture.
[01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:20.709]  Veterinarian for 30 years.
[01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:32.937]  He worked as a research veterinary pathologist at several institutes and universities, including York's Regional Primate Research Center in Atlanta, where he discovered and identified the first animal models.
[01:19:32.937 --> 01:19:34.679]  We're going to skip this break, guys, at the network.
[01:19:35.219 --> 01:19:44.102]  For cystic fibrosis, monkeys, he found that he could reproduce their condition and will because it was nutritional deficiency.
[01:19:44.102 --> 01:19:49.564]  Well, yeah, if you don't eat vitamin C, you'll get scurvy and your teeth will fall out and old wounds will open up.
[01:19:49.564 --> 01:19:50.664]  People got scurvy all over the place.
[01:19:50.664 --> 01:19:51.405]  I talked to medical doctors.
[01:19:51.405 --> 01:19:54.145]  They won't tell you to take vitamin C when you have lesions all over your body.
[01:19:54.145 --> 01:19:55.006]  They just won't tell you what it is.
[01:19:55.746 --> 01:20:01.291]  Dr. Wallach then made the decision to go to medical school so he could treat children for cystic fibrosis himself.
[01:20:01.291 --> 01:20:07.756]  He taught nutrition at the National College of Naturopathic Medicine in Oregon, became a primary care physician with a naturopathic degree.
[01:20:07.756 --> 01:20:12.140]  In 1997, Wallach established his very own company, American Longevity, now Youngevity.
[01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:14.262]  Infowarsteam.com, Infowarshealth.com.
[01:20:14.262 --> 01:20:16.043]  He consults and advises us there.
[01:20:16.043 --> 01:20:21.248]  Their entire spectrum, more than 400 products, are available there, discounted, at the highest level.
[01:20:21.248 --> 01:20:23.790]  Infowarsstore.com also has links to it.
[01:20:24.190 --> 01:20:25.811]  But that's not what we're getting into.
[01:20:25.811 --> 01:20:28.592]  We're getting into Angelina Jolie.
[01:20:28.592 --> 01:20:31.873]  What's triggering the genes to then cause the meltdown?
[01:20:31.873 --> 01:20:34.134]  Why are the pediatric cancers off the charts?
[01:20:34.134 --> 01:20:35.774]  Why is the diabetes off the charts?
[01:20:35.774 --> 01:20:43.037]  And I know Wallach is conservative, even though he's won in court over this, and won't say 100% they can cure diabetes type 2.
[01:20:43.037 --> 01:20:50.860]  But I now heard Governor Huckabee on this network with ads and on Fox News running ads saying that they can cure it.
[01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:57.550]  And what's amazing is the research shows you really can in many cases, or at least mitigate, but they won't tell people.
[01:20:57.550 --> 01:21:02.559]  But it means the dam must be breaking if Huckabee is out there doing this.
[01:21:02.559 --> 01:21:04.783]  What do you think the FDA says about that, Joel Wallach?
[01:21:06.158 --> 01:21:09.699]  Well, thank you so much, Alex, for your time and your hospitality.
[01:21:09.699 --> 01:21:11.080]  I always appreciate you.
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:14.341]  When I'm on the road, I love listening to you and all your guests.
[01:21:14.341 --> 01:21:25.386]  But if you want to jump in right away on type 2 diabetes, we've known for 70 years, Alex, it's a deficiency of a single mineral, type 2 diabetes, which makes up 98% of the population of diabetics in America.
[01:21:25.386 --> 01:21:35.370]  We can make America a diabetes-free country in two months if they were just to take all 90 essential nutrients, a little bit of extra, what we call the secret sauce that has that mineral in it.
[01:21:36.210 --> 01:21:39.831]  And, um, it's so great to be able to do this.
[01:21:39.831 --> 01:21:41.091]  We can do this for church families.
[01:21:41.091 --> 01:21:45.952]  We're actually put proposals in to small island nations that have only 280,000 citizens.
[01:21:45.952 --> 01:21:49.693]  And we're going to have to demonstrate this.
[01:21:49.693 --> 01:21:52.614]  We can eliminate type 2 diabetes in this little nation.
[01:21:52.614 --> 01:21:56.435]  It's the highest percentage, obviously, of the small nations, not the biggest numbers.
[01:21:56.435 --> 01:21:59.575]  But percentage-wise, they have the highest rate of diabetes.
[01:21:59.575 --> 01:22:02.316]  Now, that's if your pancreas isn't too far gone, though, right?
[01:22:03.206 --> 01:22:05.747]  Well, actually it has nothing to do with the pancreas.
[01:22:05.747 --> 01:22:07.067]  That's all a myth.
[01:22:07.067 --> 01:22:10.208]  When you have type 2 diabetes, there's nothing wrong with your pancreas.
[01:22:10.208 --> 01:22:13.828]  It's just there's a communication problem between the insulin produced by your pancreas.
[01:22:13.828 --> 01:22:16.429]  So the receptors can't absorb it?
[01:22:16.429 --> 01:22:17.449]  That's correct.
[01:22:17.449 --> 01:22:18.589]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:22:18.589 --> 01:22:24.271]  How could Huckabee be running national ads saying basically what you're saying now?
[01:22:24.271 --> 01:22:28.331]  I mean, he's at the highest levels of the establishment.
[01:22:28.331 --> 01:22:30.672]  That must mean they know they can't stop this information coming out.
[01:22:31.527 --> 01:22:36.156]  That's right, well I've been harping on this now for 36 years, Alex.
[01:22:36.156 --> 01:22:38.180]  No, you're the granddaddy of exposing it, there's no doubt.
[01:22:38.928 --> 01:23:03.761]  Yeah and so this is one of the reasons why the audio cassette tape and now the CD which we've sold 280 million by the way the CD 280 million they're still going out the door at 50,000 a week and this is one of the controversial things was back then when it first came out in 1992 I said that type 2 diabetes is a simple mineral deficiency and we can eliminate type 2 diabetes in weeks sometimes or certainly within two months
[01:23:04.461 --> 01:23:08.164]  And when we do this with an entire country, the world will not be able to fight it.
[01:23:08.164 --> 01:23:21.456]  Now we've done it in animals over and over and over, and I knew it wasn't genetic when I did this big project with Marlon Perkins where I did 20,000 autopsies, 10 million chemistries, looking for pollution as a contributor to our health problems.
[01:23:21.456 --> 01:23:24.099]  I found that crocodiles and alligators got type 2 diabetes.
[01:23:24.932 --> 01:23:28.214]  And how does a crocodile and alligator get a genetic disease from humans?
[01:23:28.214 --> 01:23:35.178]  Are antelope and deer get sickle cell anemia, which is supposed to be a genetically transmitted disease in the African-American population?
[01:23:35.178 --> 01:23:41.161]  So I knew the genetics was not the answer way back in the 1960s.
[01:23:41.161 --> 01:23:44.703]  And that became part of the audio cassette tape, Dead Doctors Don't Lie.
[01:23:45.635 --> 01:23:47.016]  What else is going on now?
[01:23:47.016 --> 01:23:51.778]  I mean, we've known for 50 years that folic acid, if you don't have it, you get deformities and low IQs.
[01:23:51.778 --> 01:23:55.440]  Now the feds are moving to block folic acid as a supplement.
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:58.321]  I mean, how obvious... In fact, that was in AP last week.
[01:23:58.321 --> 01:23:59.122]  I never covered it, guys.
[01:23:59.122 --> 01:24:03.304]  Type in, feds move to block folic acid being added to bread and tortillas.
[01:24:03.304 --> 01:24:11.208]  When Latin America started doing it decades ago and saw a total reversal in deformities, my dad's been involved as a doctor in aid missions down there himself.
[01:24:11.208 --> 01:24:14.930]  I mean, how evil is the government that they don't want folic acid?
[01:24:16.343 --> 01:24:18.926]  Well, this is only the tip of the iceberg, the folic acid thing.
[01:24:18.926 --> 01:24:23.150]  It's one of my eight lawsuits against the FDA, which I prevailed each time, Alex.
[01:24:23.150 --> 01:24:36.865]  It was me and four other people who actually sued the FDA to force them to put folic acid in prenatal vitamins so that we could prevent spina bifida and hydrocephalus and hydroencephaloceles, many other birth defects.
[01:24:37.846 --> 01:24:41.051]  And we prevailed in federal court.
[01:24:41.051 --> 01:24:45.997]  And then they began to put folic acid in the prenatal vitamins.
[01:24:45.997 --> 01:24:52.345]  Until then, in 1947, we put folic acid in prenatal vitamins of animals, but doctors were saying, oh, that's just in animals, not people.
[01:24:53.246 --> 01:24:56.491]  And this is really horrible what happened.
[01:24:56.491 --> 01:24:57.893]  I want to throw a statistic at you.
[01:24:57.893 --> 01:25:08.848]  This is from the Center for Disease Control, the federal agency that tracks this, Alex, and it goes into the Infowars concerns about the government doing things to injure the American people.
[01:25:09.815 --> 01:25:13.518]  Each year in America, this is from the CDC, it came out February 5th, 2007.
[01:25:13.518 --> 01:25:16.381]  It was a full page newspaper story in the USA Today.
[01:25:16.381 --> 01:25:17.882]  Full page story.
[01:25:17.882 --> 01:25:29.271]  It said, each year in America, medical doctors, each year in America, medical doctors in their workplace, hospitals and clinics, kill and injure and infect 15 million Americans.
[01:25:30.182 --> 01:25:35.566]  Two million in hospitals are infected, 90,000 die from these infections.
[01:25:35.566 --> 01:25:37.648]  Over a million are killed by doctors.
[01:25:37.648 --> 01:25:39.350]  They don't even get an OSHA ticket.
[01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:47.476]  What would happen if Iran or Iraq were to do that, or if North Korea were to do it with a biological weapon and infect two million people in a large population center and kill 90,000?
[01:25:47.476 --> 01:25:48.637]  It'd be war!
[01:25:48.637 --> 01:25:54.322]  Well, here's one trade that does it every year, and nobody seems to mind because of the greater agenda, as you point out.
[01:25:59.737 --> 01:26:01.266]  Okay.
[01:26:01.266 --> 01:26:02.332]  What is the greater agenda?
[01:26:03.732 --> 01:26:15.175]  Well, you cannot help but look at all these statistics and see that, um, why can one trade kill, injure, and infect 15 million of their customers every year in their workplace?
[01:26:15.175 --> 01:26:16.935]  They don't even get an OSHA ticket.
[01:26:16.935 --> 01:26:19.916]  They have no oversight by any government agency.
[01:26:19.916 --> 01:26:27.018]  They've been a self-policing monopoly for 100 years, since 1914.
[01:26:27.018 --> 01:26:31.499]  And it's one of those crazy things that the government says, well, these guys must be doing something good.
[01:26:33.099 --> 01:26:38.801]  We're just going to leave them run because they're doing, you know, they're kind of an irregular militia doing what we want them to do.
[01:26:38.801 --> 01:26:39.501]  We don't have to pay them.
[01:26:39.501 --> 01:26:43.222]  It's kind of a crazy thing.
[01:26:43.222 --> 01:26:48.444]  Well, medical doctors make their money by defrauding the American public.
[01:26:48.744 --> 01:26:51.585]  85% of all personal bankruptcies are due to medical costs.
[01:26:51.585 --> 01:27:06.391]  Each year, and this is from the Institute of Medicine, the ethics watchdog for the medical trade, this came out in, let's see here, oh, in September 7th, 2012, full page story in every newspaper in America.
[01:27:06.391 --> 01:27:13.994]  They said, each year in America, medical doctors fraudulently bill 30 cents out of every dollar to insurance companies and patients
[01:27:15.484 --> 01:27:15.544]  The
[01:27:36.388 --> 01:27:38.149]  And nobody does anything to them.
[01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:43.910]  So we as the American people have to do what we did in the days we were fighting King George in England.
[01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:45.231]  We have to use a different service.
[01:27:45.231 --> 01:27:48.832]  We stopped using tea because he wouldn't let us have representation in England.
[01:27:48.832 --> 01:27:50.032]  We went to coffee.
[01:27:50.032 --> 01:27:54.374]  We're going to have to begin to do these things ourselves and this was the purpose of the book Let's Play Doctor.
[01:27:55.214 --> 01:28:01.738]  Well, Dr. Joel Wallach is our guest, and if you just tuned in, this is earth-shaking information.
[01:28:01.738 --> 01:28:07.762]  Again, the pediatric cancers are up over 10,000%, diabetes up over 3,000%, type 2.
[01:28:07.762 --> 01:28:17.729]  I know so many parents that got vaccines in the last year, and suddenly their two, three, four-year-olds have failure in their pancreas from pancreatitis.
[01:28:17.729 --> 01:28:23.593]  They go to the doctor, and they say, oh, you've now got type 1 from your genetics, even though their families don't have it.
[01:28:23.593 --> 01:28:24.694]  They're covering that up.
[01:28:25.474 --> 01:28:35.484]  That the vaccines are triggering some type of problem in the pancreas and then I read the inserts of the MMR shot and it says may give you pancreatitis and may give you diabetes.
[01:28:35.484 --> 01:28:36.745]  What about that Dr. Wallach?
[01:28:38.134 --> 01:28:53.318]  Well, again, they always look at, and this is criminal, you point out very clearly, Alex, you're quite correct, this is criminal, because they say, well, you have to weigh the benefit to the greater good versus the perhaps harm to the individual.
[01:28:53.318 --> 01:28:58.679]  And so, seriously, everything that the FDA approves has one of the major side effects is death.
[01:28:59.377 --> 01:29:04.840]  The only, everything that the FDA approves of has a major side effect of death.
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:05.781]  Everything.
[01:29:05.781 --> 01:29:12.625]  Think of how many drugs you've seen over the years that have been FDA approved, within a year or two they're getting recalled because of a high death rate.
[01:29:12.625 --> 01:29:15.087]  Well, they knew that before they approved it and put it on the market.
[01:29:15.087 --> 01:29:16.368]  And I give them a slap on the wrist.
[01:29:17.188 --> 01:29:18.149]  Exactly.
[01:29:18.149 --> 01:29:21.270]  And of course, these drugs are all designed to treat symptoms.
[01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:22.991]  None were designed to cure anything.
[01:29:22.991 --> 01:29:27.194]  Where nutrients, as you pointed out quite clearly, with scurvy, cures things.
[01:29:27.194 --> 01:29:30.536]  Let's just take congestive heart failure, the most common cause of heart failure in America.
[01:29:30.536 --> 01:29:31.036]  Stay there, Dr. Wallach.
[01:29:31.036 --> 01:29:35.598]  I want to walk through all this and tie it into Angelina Jolie on the other side of this break.
[01:29:35.598 --> 01:29:38.820]  I want to talk about hydrofluorosilic acid and more.
[01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:43.443]  Dr. Joel Wallach, a literal icon who helped defeat the FDA and save the nutrient.
[01:29:44.023 --> 01:29:45.867]  Nutraceutical industry over and over again.
[01:29:45.867 --> 01:29:47.650]  We all owe him a debt of gratitude.
[01:29:47.650 --> 01:29:50.074]  The man is a legend when you actually know the facts.
[01:30:00.371 --> 01:30:06.498]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[01:30:06.498 --> 01:30:11.083]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[01:30:11.083 --> 01:30:18.791]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[01:30:19.031 --> 01:30:24.533]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[01:30:24.533 --> 01:30:30.496]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[01:30:30.496 --> 01:30:35.438]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[01:30:35.438 --> 01:30:39.379]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[01:30:39.379 --> 01:30:45.562]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[01:30:45.982 --> 01:30:51.147]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[01:30:51.147 --> 01:30:54.871]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.

[01:30:59.976 --> 01:31:08.585]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive Infowarslife Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[01:31:08.965 --> 01:31:19.511]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[01:31:19.511 --> 01:31:25.554]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:31:25.914 --> 01:31:32.318]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:31:32.318 --> 01:31:40.924]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin, the most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.
[01:31:40.924 --> 01:31:44.006]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:31:44.006 --> 01:31:45.527]  No needles, no injections.
[01:31:45.527 --> 01:31:46.928]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:31:46.928 --> 01:31:48.129]  Try it for yourself.
[01:31:48.129 --> 01:31:49.470]  Discover the secret.
[01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:50.551]  Secret 12.
[01:31:50.551 --> 01:31:52.892]  Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited.

[01:32:02.216 --> 01:32:05.897]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:32:05.897 --> 01:32:06.737]  Security alert.
[01:32:06.737 --> 01:32:07.957]  Security alert.
[01:32:07.957 --> 01:32:09.958]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:32:09.958 --> 01:32:10.858]  Analysis.
[01:32:10.858 --> 01:32:11.578]  InfoWars.
[01:32:11.578 --> 01:32:13.539]  Building independent media operations.
[01:32:13.539 --> 01:32:18.560]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:19.580]  Prime directive.
[01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:21.140]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:23.981]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:32:23.981 --> 01:32:27.222]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:32:27.222 --> 01:32:29.382]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:32:29.702 --> 01:32:31.043]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:32:31.043 --> 01:32:33.885]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:32:33.885 --> 01:32:35.826]  They're never going to stop.
[01:32:35.826 --> 01:32:39.889]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:32:43.472 --> 01:32:46.834]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[01:32:46.834 --> 01:32:47.815]  Imperative.
[01:32:47.815 --> 01:32:49.836]  Destroy Britain's minute TV.
[01:32:49.836 --> 01:32:54.539]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:32:54.539 --> 01:32:55.920]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:56.661]  You can feel it.
[01:33:12.674 --> 01:33:18.706]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:21.096 --> 01:33:26.841]  Dr. Joel Wallach is our guest, a syndicated host of Dead Doctors Don't Lie on over 300 stations.
[01:33:26.841 --> 01:33:28.662]  Last time I checked, around the country.
[01:33:28.662 --> 01:33:33.226]  Best-selling author of the new book, Epigenetics, The Death of the Genetic Theory and Disease.
[01:33:33.226 --> 01:33:39.071]  My dad's got a degree in dental surgery, oral surgery, and also in chemistry.
[01:33:39.071 --> 01:33:42.654]  And he was just blown away by how technical it was and how accurate.
[01:33:43.374 --> 01:33:47.878]  My dad also worked at MD Anderson in cancer research for about five years off and on.
[01:33:47.878 --> 01:33:56.865]  He also worked in assisting when he was still a dentist but younger on eye surgery and things like that.
[01:33:56.865 --> 01:33:59.747]  And he just thinks it's an amazing book and he's a pretty smart fella.
[01:33:59.747 --> 01:34:05.732]  But who's really smart are the medical doctors and scientists that are also in the book and the studies and what they show.
[01:34:05.732 --> 01:34:09.836]  I mean this really overthrows the genetic theory of disease transmission.
[01:34:10.476 --> 01:34:14.940]  I mean, yeah, if you're predisposed to get lung cancer, when you're 100 years old, you might get it.
[01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:21.665]  But you're going to get it when you're 45 if you smoke cigarettes, because the toxins in there are going to mutate and screw up the cells.
[01:34:21.665 --> 01:34:27.209]  But if you've got the nutrients you need, you probably might get it, just a layman statement here, when you're 75.
[01:34:27.209 --> 01:34:33.334]  You would have died when you were 100, but you smoked cigarettes, but you got the nutrients, so 75.
[01:34:33.334 --> 01:34:34.175]  You don't get the nutrients?
[01:34:35.273 --> 01:34:36.454]  I mean, you might get cancer when you're 30.
[01:34:36.454 --> 01:34:38.575]  I mean, it's real simple, folks.
[01:34:38.575 --> 01:34:41.156]  You don't get vitamin C, you die.
[01:34:41.156 --> 01:34:42.777]  Your teeth fall out.
[01:34:42.777 --> 01:34:45.038]  Your skin breaks open.
[01:34:45.038 --> 01:34:50.962]  I see all these old people that, you know, drink Diet Coke and eat crap TV dinners with no food in it.
[01:34:50.962 --> 01:34:52.362]  They don't eat citrus.
[01:34:52.362 --> 01:34:53.043]  They don't get minerals.
[01:34:53.911 --> 01:34:55.753]  You see old people with scurvy.
[01:34:55.753 --> 01:34:59.338]  Their teeth are falling out, there's blood in their eyes, their skin.
[01:34:59.338 --> 01:35:02.122]  Ted Anderson's dad basically had scurvy, and he lets me tell the story.
[01:35:02.122 --> 01:35:04.705]  I feel disrespectful telling it, but Ted lets me tell it.
[01:35:04.705 --> 01:35:06.507]  In fact, wants me to.
[01:35:06.507 --> 01:35:11.293]  He did be on tangy tangerine for about four months, had Alzheimer's, couldn't even go fishing anymore, didn't know who he was.
[01:35:12.438 --> 01:35:25.661]  Got on Beyond Tangy Tangerine 2.0 and a bunch of the other stuff at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, links to InfoWarsHealth.com, and the main site to go to is InfoWarsTeam.com to get the Beyond Tangy Tangerine.
[01:35:25.661 --> 01:35:26.742]  But we ought to drag Ted in.
[01:35:26.742 --> 01:35:27.602]  He's at the network today.
[01:35:27.602 --> 01:35:33.443]  I don't even know if he's up there in Minnesota, but if he's around, John, see if he's there and drag him in here to get on the studio.
[01:35:33.443 --> 01:35:34.764]  And people know I do this impromptu.
[01:35:34.764 --> 01:35:36.724]  This isn't staged.
[01:35:36.724 --> 01:35:39.565]  So, Harmon, let me know if Ted's there, because I hate talking about his dad, but
[01:35:40.652 --> 01:35:42.054]  His arms were opening up.
[01:35:42.054 --> 01:35:43.776]  He had sores on him.
[01:35:43.776 --> 01:35:46.078]  I'd been up there to Minnesota and met him.
[01:35:46.078 --> 01:35:47.159]  And Ted got him on this.
[01:35:47.159 --> 01:35:49.262]  Within a few months, he knew who he was again.
[01:35:49.262 --> 01:35:52.125]  He was fishing.
[01:35:52.125 --> 01:35:54.207]  His short-term and long-term memory were back.
[01:35:54.207 --> 01:35:56.330]  And then the doctor said, what's going on?
[01:35:56.330 --> 01:35:59.813]  Your blood's got high K. And we give you Coumadin so you don't have a stroke.
[01:35:59.813 --> 01:36:00.414]  Never had a stroke.
[01:36:00.414 --> 01:36:01.515]  They give him Coumadin to thin the blood.
[01:36:02.771 --> 01:36:10.197]  And ordered him off of it, and his mother, Ted's mother, sweetheart, so I feel disrespectful to talk about his mother, but he's just telling it because he's mad about it.
[01:36:10.197 --> 01:36:11.599]  Ted's mother, in charge.
[01:36:13.266 --> 01:36:16.088]  Said, you will not get that Beyond Tengu Tangerine 2.0 anymore.
[01:36:16.088 --> 01:36:17.709]  You will not get the other things.
[01:36:17.709 --> 01:36:21.131]  And within a month, he went back to not knowing who he was, and the sores all opened up.
[01:36:21.131 --> 01:36:26.214]  I mean, Wallach, there's a real story of the owner of this network, who I've known for 20 years.
[01:36:26.214 --> 01:36:29.897]  He was a sponsor for two years before he started the network, Ted Anderson.
[01:36:29.897 --> 01:36:32.078]  And these doctors are God.
[01:36:32.078 --> 01:36:36.521]  And his mother, and I don't mean to be mean, it's just true, would follow those orders.
[01:36:36.521 --> 01:36:38.022]  That is incredible, Dr. Wallach.
[01:36:39.685 --> 01:36:47.751]  Well, you're exactly right, Alex, and this used to be the way it was in the days of King George, and no taxation without representation.
[01:36:47.751 --> 01:36:57.159]  And so my view is, if we're to survive what's going on between the doctors and the patients and the government and the citizens, we have to take over.
[01:36:57.159 --> 01:37:03.484]  I'm not talking about a shooting war, but what we have to do, at least initially, is to take over our health care.
[01:37:04.304 --> 01:37:06.185]  And do our own laboratory tests.
[01:37:06.185 --> 01:37:07.786]  We actually have a book called Leslie, Doctor.
[01:37:07.786 --> 01:37:12.528]  It teaches people in the chapter on laboratory, home laboratory.
[01:37:12.528 --> 01:37:15.710]  You can go to a pharmacy, Alex, without a prescription.
[01:37:15.710 --> 01:37:18.711]  You get all the same test strips your doctor will use in a physical in his office.
[01:37:18.711 --> 01:37:21.533]  He'll charge you $2,000 for that physical.
[01:37:21.533 --> 01:37:24.814]  You get the same test strips, $1.50 apiece.
[01:37:24.814 --> 01:37:26.475]  And you're looking at $4.50 for a complete physical.
[01:37:28.436 --> 01:37:28.916]  Instead of $2,000.
[01:37:28.916 --> 01:37:29.797]  You can do it yourself.
[01:37:29.797 --> 01:37:32.239]  And by the way, we should add how old you are.
[01:37:32.239 --> 01:37:35.301]  You look like, in person, like you're about 55.
[01:37:35.301 --> 01:37:36.282]  Your skin's glowing.
[01:37:36.282 --> 01:37:38.083]  How old are you, Dr. Wallach?
[01:37:38.083 --> 01:37:42.066]  In two months, I'll be 76.
[01:37:42.066 --> 01:37:43.246]  Incredible.
[01:37:43.246 --> 01:37:45.448]  I didn't mean to interrupt, but please... That's alright.
[01:37:45.448 --> 01:37:48.270]  How can you say someone shouldn't have vitamin K?
[01:37:48.270 --> 01:37:49.250]  You'll die without it.
[01:37:49.250 --> 01:37:49.671]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:37:50.751 --> 01:37:57.954]  No, yeah, vitamin K is absolutely necessary for life, for everything from proper blood clotting to bone health.
[01:37:57.954 --> 01:38:03.876]  And, you know, doctors are very, well, silly is a kind way to say it.
[01:38:03.876 --> 01:38:09.619]  That's why the title of my CD and my book, Dead Doctors Don't Lie, is the only time the doctors won't lie is when they're dead.
[01:38:12.076 --> 01:38:16.480]  What I need to do is make sure that everybody knows they can do their own lab work.
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:20.023]  For $4.50, that includes the equivalent of a colonoscopic exam.
[01:38:20.023 --> 01:38:23.346]  The book, Let's Play Doctor, teaches you how to do all these things.
[01:38:23.346 --> 01:38:28.770]  You go to a pharmacy without a prescription, get all the same test strips your doctors use, do your own blood pressure, do your own weight.
[01:38:28.770 --> 01:38:31.873]  And we don't need the doctors anymore, except if you get run over by a truck.
[01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:38.041]  By the way, Dr. Wallach, we were able to drag Ted Anderson in.
[01:38:38.041 --> 01:38:40.801]  He probably ran across the building and probably breathing heavy.
[01:38:40.801 --> 01:38:48.723]  Ted Anderson, owner of the GCN Radio Network, syndicated over 1,400 affiliates with all of his stations, third largest radio network in the U.S.
[01:38:48.723 --> 01:38:51.203]  And Ted, I always feel disrespectful telling the story about your dad.
[01:38:51.203 --> 01:38:53.224]  I haven't checked in on him in about a year.
[01:38:53.224 --> 01:38:54.104]  I haven't been up there.
[01:38:54.104 --> 01:38:55.604]  I should have.
[01:38:55.604 --> 01:38:56.624]  I just told the story.
[01:38:56.624 --> 01:38:57.605]  I don't know if you heard that.
[01:38:59.665 --> 01:39:06.810]  Give people your brief testimony about what Beyond Tangy Tangerine, the longevity products, did for your dad and then what the medical doctor said.
[01:39:06.810 --> 01:39:09.531]  Well, I mean, here's what we're dealing with here.
[01:39:09.531 --> 01:39:17.717]  A poor guy was being rushed to the Veterans Hospital once every four to six days because he had run low on electrolytes.
[01:39:17.717 --> 01:39:20.278]  And we got him on the Beyond Tangy Tangerine.
[01:39:20.278 --> 01:39:23.540]  I mean, this went on about five or six times.
[01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:26.542]  And we got him on the Beyond Tangy Tangerine and it stopped.
[01:39:26.542 --> 01:39:28.844]  He hadn't had to be brought back to the hospital since.
[01:39:29.824 --> 01:39:35.168]  He is suffering with dementia, but if he does not get his electrolytes, it's like the man is gone.
[01:39:35.168 --> 01:39:41.612]  You give him his electrolytes, and he remembers who you are, and he's smiling, he's happy, he has energy.
[01:39:41.612 --> 01:39:46.355]  You know, that's just the, you know, the man is aging in the process.
[01:39:46.355 --> 01:39:53.560]  I can't get him off the statin drugs because the doctors insist that he has to have them, and it's not my choice.
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:58.464]  But I can tell you right now, Alex, he is so much better because he's on the Longevity products.
[01:39:59.144 --> 01:40:02.267]  Okay, because a couple years ago, the doctor had ordered him off.
[01:40:02.267 --> 01:40:07.651]  I guess he got a different doctor, or correct me, and the symptoms really came back big time.
[01:40:07.651 --> 01:40:09.352]  Was I telling that story accurately, Ted?
[01:40:09.352 --> 01:40:10.533]  Oh, you definitely were.
[01:40:10.533 --> 01:40:15.738]  As a matter of fact, it's because they had him on Coumadin, and when he went into the doctor, his levels went off.
[01:40:16.318 --> 01:40:21.903]  And they took him off the Beyond Tangy Tangerine because they wanted to keep him on the Coumadin for blood thinning.
[01:40:21.903 --> 01:40:32.772]  Finally, we got him off the Coumadin and that was back a few years ago and that's when he was being rushed into the hospital and he had this problem where his electrolytes would drop.
[01:40:33.112 --> 01:40:33.392]  Thank you!
[01:40:48.470 --> 01:40:59.437]  When you put them on the healthy start pack along with the glucosamine, it helps the discs between the vertebrae puff up and it helps the heartbeat properly.
[01:40:59.437 --> 01:41:04.461]  You get them the Beyond Tangy Tangerine and all of a sudden the AFib is not a problem anymore.
[01:41:04.461 --> 01:41:06.782]  At least that was the experience with my father.
[01:41:06.782 --> 01:41:07.363]  Absolutely.
[01:41:07.363 --> 01:41:08.403]  Thank you Ted Anderson.
[01:41:08.403 --> 01:41:10.264]  And you were speaking of hearts before the break.
[01:41:10.264 --> 01:41:12.206]  I want you to get back into that Dr. Wallach.
[01:41:12.206 --> 01:41:14.167]  But this is what we're dealing with here.
[01:41:15.956 --> 01:41:20.700]  Where these doctors literally don't want people on vitamins and nutrients and things.
[01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:26.785]  It is just so incredibly obvious that we've absolutely have to have these.
[01:41:26.785 --> 01:41:30.468]  Dr. Wallach, you were getting into the heart before we went to break.
[01:41:31.574 --> 01:41:34.798]  Literally and figuratively, this is the heart of the problem.
[01:41:34.798 --> 01:41:36.099]  Very good example.
[01:41:36.099 --> 01:41:45.569]  A congestive heart failure, the most common cause of heart death in adults in the United States, is actually the terminal event for beriberi, which is a deficiency of a single vitamin.
[01:41:45.569 --> 01:41:48.893]  You give all 90 essential nutrients with an extra amount of that single vitamin.
[01:41:48.893 --> 01:41:50.515]  I get people off the heart transplant list.
[01:41:50.515 --> 01:41:52.897]  I've been on there for three years on 27 prescription drugs.
[01:41:53.778 --> 01:41:56.720]  And we do this dozens and dozens of times a year.
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:42:05.745]  It should be thousands, but so many people are frightened and they stay with their doctor, and they're prepared to die and suffer to make sure their doctor gets paid, instead of trying something else.
[01:42:05.745 --> 01:42:12.729]  They'll try five bids on a roof of a house or a sprinkler system, but they stick with the same doctor, whatever the doctor says they do.
[01:42:12.729 --> 01:42:15.250]  And this is a matter of marketing on the doctor's behalf.
[01:42:15.250 --> 01:42:22.014]  Well, you know what Dr. Blaylock, top brain surgeon, introduced the terms excitotoxin and scores of other literature.
[01:42:22.694 --> 01:42:28.661]  That is now seen as prestigious because he did it 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, and it's now accepted.
[01:42:28.661 --> 01:42:37.552]  He explains that you have chronically inflamed brains from vaccines, GMOs, the mercury, the sugar.
[01:42:38.032 --> 01:42:38.693]  Thank you.
[01:42:55.373 --> 01:42:56.634]  Now again, my dad's a chemist.
[01:42:56.634 --> 01:42:57.955]  My dad would say this 20 years ago.
[01:42:57.955 --> 01:42:59.896]  He'd get mad when he saw statin ads.
[01:42:59.896 --> 01:43:03.759]  But he's not an MD like Blaylock and a brain expert.
[01:43:03.759 --> 01:43:11.986]  Blaylock said that your brain is made up, as you know, Dr. Wallach, of cholesterol and that statin drugs literally eat your brain.
[01:43:12.566 --> 01:43:15.508]  And so we wonder why there's an epidemic of Alzheimer's.
[01:43:15.508 --> 01:43:20.271]  Well, it's the mercury and it's the aluminum, but it's also the statin drugs.
[01:43:20.271 --> 01:43:22.712]  And we've got studies on that, but they push them.
[01:43:22.712 --> 01:43:25.754]  Now they want to put statins, quote, in the water supply.
[01:43:25.754 --> 01:43:26.615]  Folks won't believe that.
[01:43:26.615 --> 01:43:27.916]  Put it into Google.
[01:43:27.916 --> 01:43:31.198]  Dr. Wallach, speak about statins.
[01:43:31.198 --> 01:43:34.900]  Okay, well, statin drugs, of course, are the cause of Alzheimer's disease.
[01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:37.962]  Alzheimer's disease did not exist even by another name, Alex, 45 years ago.
[01:43:39.717 --> 01:43:52.930]  Today's number four killer of adults over the age of 64, and it's caused by going away the myelin, the white matter of the brain, resulting in the naked nerve fibers tangling up nerve tangles, which are the classic feature of Alzheimer's disease.
[01:43:52.930 --> 01:43:55.253]  They short-circuit and you get Alzheimer's disease.
[01:43:55.253 --> 01:44:00.758]  You get a little bit of violent behavior, your cognition, your ability to solve problems goes away, your memory goes away.
[01:44:01.759 --> 01:44:05.983]  And it's all because when you get on standard drugs, it lowers your blood cholesterol.
[01:44:05.983 --> 01:44:10.728]  Of course, that's the use of it for cardiovascular disease.
[01:44:10.728 --> 01:44:16.834]  And it turns out that 75% of your brain weight is made up of this myelin, this white matter of the brain, which is 100% cholesterol.
[01:44:18.530 --> 01:44:35.384]  And then they put you on cholesterol-restricted diets, and they've created Alzheimer's disease, low T, erectile dysfunction, menopausal symptoms, and basically, people need to eat anywhere from 12, 15, 20, 25 eggs a day, and they'll prevent and get rid of Alzheimer's disease.
[01:44:36.124 --> 01:44:37.205]  Okay, they can't be fried.
[01:44:37.205 --> 01:44:41.611]  They have to be poached with a soft yolk or soft scrambling butter, not in oils.
[01:44:41.611 --> 01:44:43.012]  Take the 90 cents of nutrients.
[01:44:43.012 --> 01:44:43.973]  Eat your 8, 10, 12.
[01:44:43.973 --> 01:44:47.558]  I just had four poached eggs for breakfast this morning.
[01:44:47.558 --> 01:44:49.740]  After my meeting tonight, I'll have four poached eggs again.
[01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:53.485]  I'll have eight poached eggs today, along with a nice big steak and
[01:44:55.977 --> 01:45:04.043]  Since I started doing what you said three years ago, because at first with Longevity I knew it was good products, but I just never took vitamins, couldn't make myself do any of it.
[01:45:04.043 --> 01:45:12.029]  Since I started doing everything at Infowarshealth.com that you recommend with the videos there to train people, I've lost more than 50 pounds.
[01:45:12.029 --> 01:45:12.449]  I got up to 279.
[01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:20.112]  And I have so much more energy, my skin looks better, my stamina, just everything.
[01:45:20.112 --> 01:45:25.193]  And that's what I had this morning was four poached eggs and spinach.
[01:45:25.193 --> 01:45:32.515]  And that's basically what I eat is fish, red meat and eggs and then raw salad and other vegetables.
[01:45:32.515 --> 01:45:34.136]  And I just feel like I'm 20 years old.
[01:45:34.136 --> 01:45:37.317]  I mean, I feel like I'm ready to tear people's arms off.
[01:45:37.317 --> 01:45:37.957]  It's just amazing.
[01:45:39.005 --> 01:45:40.125]  I'm glad you're a member of the club.
[01:45:40.125 --> 01:45:43.726]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:45:43.726 --> 01:45:54.869]  And of course, we have documented in the book Epigenetics, as you point out, all the double-blind research projects that were done to prevent and reverse Alzheimer's disease.
[01:45:54.869 --> 01:45:56.170]  We know how to prevent Alzheimer's disease.
[01:45:56.170 --> 01:45:57.650]  We know how to reverse it.
[01:45:57.650 --> 01:46:04.252]  I've diagnosed Alzheimer's disease by four neurological clinics at the University of North Carolina.
[01:46:05.212 --> 01:46:10.075]  And in five days time, this guy gets up, gets dressed, walks out of the nursing home.
[01:46:10.075 --> 01:46:13.337]  He was in a coma, ready to die.
[01:46:13.337 --> 01:46:16.038]  Five days later, he gets up, gets dressed, goes back to work.
[01:46:16.038 --> 01:46:16.939]  That was five years ago.
[01:46:16.939 --> 01:46:21.721]  He's still going and no Alzheimer's disease anymore.
[01:46:21.721 --> 01:46:28.325]  Talk a little bit about the Rockefellers and how they took over the different branches of medicine in the last hundred years.
[01:46:29.443 --> 01:46:32.206]  Okay, well that all started about 1912.
[01:46:32.206 --> 01:46:36.590]  Rockefeller Institute and the Carnegie Institute, you know, the steel guys.
[01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:39.673]  The usual suspects, they're the ones financing riots against the police right now.
[01:46:40.393 --> 01:46:42.395]  Yep, exactly the same bunch.
[01:46:42.395 --> 01:46:47.799]  They actually hired a retired university president, a guy by the name of Flexner.
[01:46:47.799 --> 01:46:59.069]  And Flexner was to do a report and look at the top 130 medical schools in America and find out which one of them are thems, I suppose if you're from the South.
[01:47:02.111 --> 01:47:12.155]  They would, and I'm from the South so I can say that, but at any rate, they were looking for the medical schools who would train medical students on pharmaceuticals instead of herbs and homeopathy and nutrition.
[01:47:12.155 --> 01:47:20.079]  They found 30 of them out of the top 130, and they began to give them money to hire the best professors, the best equipment.
[01:47:20.079 --> 01:47:22.340]  They gave grants to medical students to go there.
[01:47:22.340 --> 01:47:27.962]  So all the other medical schools sort of died on the vine, not because they attacked them directly, they just died on the vine for lack of funding.
[01:47:28.542 --> 01:47:29.363]  Well, it turns out...
[01:47:42.156 --> 01:47:58.288]  That at the same time, through giving money under the table to the elected officials at the national, the state, the county, and the city levels, they were able to make the medical profession a protected monopoly, self-policing with no oversight by any other agency.
[01:47:58.288 --> 01:47:59.930]  Then along came insurance.
[01:47:59.930 --> 01:48:03.672]  That was the death knell of Americans, was the insurance thing.
[01:48:03.672 --> 01:48:07.735]  Because people would say, well, I don't care if you can help me for three bucks a day,
[01:48:08.576 --> 01:48:12.306]  Because I can get my leg cut off for nothing through insurance.
[01:48:13.038 --> 01:48:17.400]  And so they always take the more drastic treatment because insurance would pay for it, rather than the one that would save their lives.
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:23.942]  Well sure, and if you go back until about a hundred years ago, only elitists could go to medical doctors in most cases, so it was seen as a status thing.
[01:48:23.942 --> 01:48:26.983]  So you have this sycophantic worship of MDs.
[01:48:26.983 --> 01:48:30.584]  And an MD's great if I got a hernia, or a broken leg, or a gunshot wound.
[01:48:30.584 --> 01:48:32.945]  A lot of them are great people and know this information.
[01:48:32.945 --> 01:48:39.547]  But under Obamacare, they're now centralizing everything, where the MDs will now be total slaves of the computers.
[01:48:39.547 --> 01:48:41.708]  It's come out that the veterans are on don't treat list.
[01:48:42.288 --> 01:48:54.292]  And I think that's why alternative medicine and stuff is exploding right now, is the pressure of the medical system collapsing into total corruption, and any good parts of it basically dying, is forcing people to alternatives.
[01:48:54.292 --> 01:48:57.473]  Briefly, Dr. Wallach, speak about the Alex Pack
[01:48:57.993 --> 01:48:58.193]  Thank you.
[01:49:13.626 --> 01:49:18.930]  789-9277 to any orders or to ask any questions 888-789-9277 InfoWarsTeam.com or you can also go to InfoWarsHealth.com you get 30% off on all
[01:49:30.438 --> 01:49:30.798]  I'm good.
[01:49:51.219 --> 01:49:52.100]  So there it is.
[01:49:52.100 --> 01:49:56.343]  You can also send questions to Catherine at InfoWars.com.
[01:49:56.343 --> 01:50:00.146]  And you've got the InfoWars team there.
[01:50:00.146 --> 01:50:02.447]  And that ends up going to the great folks at Yongevity.
[01:50:02.447 --> 01:50:07.791]  And then you've got the actual in-house InfoWars folks at InfoWarsHealth.com that can also answer your questions.
[01:50:07.791 --> 01:50:15.197]  So that's the reason we have two different sites, two different divisions to make sure we've always got service 24 hours a day, the informational videos and more.
[01:50:15.197 --> 01:50:16.938]  InfoWarsHealth.com.
[01:50:16.938 --> 01:50:19.239]  We're going to go to break and come back with that question for Dr.
[01:50:20.301 --> 01:50:26.881]  Wallach to specifically speak about the products, but in 30 seconds, what are the main products from Longevity folks need to get, Dr. Wallach?
[01:50:28.083 --> 01:50:34.048]  Well, I like the Alex Pack, and thank you for loaning us your credibility, because this is a great thing.
[01:50:34.048 --> 01:50:36.970]  It's going to bring more and more Americans to health.
[01:50:36.970 --> 01:50:39.432]  The Alex Pack is made up of three products.
[01:50:39.432 --> 01:50:51.922]  The Beyond Tangerine 2.0, the Osteo FX Plus, which is a mixture of our minerals and calcium and vitamin D3, and the EFA Pluses, which are the omega-3s, 6s, and 9s in proper ratio.
[01:50:51.922 --> 01:50:55.445]  This gives you everything you need to do to prevent as many as 900 different diseases.
[01:50:55.845 --> 01:50:57.386]  If you have any diseases, you take these.

[01:52:59.906 --> 01:53:09.512]  As the new world order continues to tighten its grip on every facet of our lives, we're all asking ourselves, how can we maintain our independence?
[01:53:09.512 --> 01:53:11.073]  The answer is clear.
[01:53:11.073 --> 01:53:13.655]  Get prepared and you get prepared now.
[01:53:13.655 --> 01:53:16.217]  Now the only question left is where do we begin?

[01:54:27.230 --> 01:54:30.672]  Dave Mustaine of Megadeth bringing us in.
[01:54:33.238 --> 01:54:38.701]  We're seeing millions of dead every year from Big Pharma across this planet.
[01:54:38.701 --> 01:54:40.783]  Yes, just like the Pied Piper.
[01:54:40.783 --> 01:54:44.986]  Let ISIS loose.
[01:54:44.986 --> 01:54:46.286]  Oh, I forgot to mention this.
[01:54:46.286 --> 01:54:48.308]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[01:54:48.308 --> 01:54:54.492]  Folic acid, this is from Philly.com, fortification to prevent birth defects hits FDA roadblock.
[01:54:54.492 --> 01:54:56.393]  They're trying to block it.
[01:54:56.393 --> 01:54:57.134]  That's right.
[01:54:57.134 --> 01:54:58.975]  Take the iodine out of the salt and put
[01:55:00.498 --> 01:55:01.619]  Fluoride in the water.
[01:55:01.619 --> 01:55:04.520]  I mean, you know, keep folic acid out.
[01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:06.041]  This is just out of control.
[01:55:06.041 --> 01:55:10.903]  We're going to keep our guest, Dr. Walsh, a little bit with us in the next hour.
[01:55:10.903 --> 01:55:12.464]  And then Gerald Salente is joining us.
[01:55:12.464 --> 01:55:15.665]  I wanted to get him on today about the war on cash.
[01:55:15.665 --> 01:55:23.248]  Now, these other announcements, but speaking of Infowars.com, I saw this last week and even said on air, I bet it's a PSYOP.
[01:55:23.248 --> 01:55:24.629]  I bet it's a false flag.
[01:55:24.629 --> 01:55:25.610]  Wasn't a hard prediction.
[01:55:27.205 --> 01:55:48.742]  Guestimation 99% of the time a cross is burned in somebody's yard now or a swastika is put on a Jewish synagogue or a dorm or it's done by people to get attention and raise funds and now a liberal globalist attorney has gone on KXAN locally and admitted they put up a sticker saying white only on businesses for Black Lives Matter.
[01:55:48.742 --> 01:55:52.906]  Adam Raposa, activist lawyer, says he's behind whites only stickers in Austin.
[01:55:54.693 --> 01:55:58.915]  I mean, stirring people up, false flagging, George Soros crud.
[01:55:58.915 --> 01:55:59.735]  That's all.
[01:55:59.735 --> 01:56:02.416]  Meanwhile, we're all going under deficiencies.
[01:56:02.416 --> 01:56:09.279]  If you're black in the studies, look it up, fluoride hits you twice as hard in your heart, your pancreas, your thyroid.
[01:56:09.279 --> 01:56:12.280]  I mean, black people, it's a death sentence.
[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:15.401]  Nobody's going to tell them from their community because they're all bought and paid for.
[01:56:15.401 --> 01:56:19.583]  I mean, you know, so they're going to have some lawyer stirring up trouble.
[01:56:20.779 --> 01:56:21.539]  And it was all over the news.
[01:56:21.539 --> 01:56:23.320]  How dare these whites put that on their things?
[01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:25.922]  This is all made up.
[01:56:25.922 --> 01:56:28.083]  There's such little racism by whites.
[01:56:28.083 --> 01:56:33.606]  Most whites are these politically correct, knee-knocking, totally... There's not racism.
[01:56:33.606 --> 01:56:36.308]  This political correctness makes white people feel guilty and scared.
[01:56:36.308 --> 01:56:42.351]  I mean, I'll be able to politically correct people out eating dinner sometimes and black people sitting down next to us.
[01:56:42.351 --> 01:56:43.072]  That's so annoying.
[01:56:43.072 --> 01:56:45.733]  I got some family friends that I love, dearly love.
[01:56:45.733 --> 01:56:46.734]  We were out to lunch.
[01:56:48.004 --> 01:56:48.544]  I don't know.
[01:57:12.056 --> 01:57:13.678]  They're the real racists in my view.
[01:57:13.678 --> 01:57:15.920]  Infowars.com has the story.
[01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:18.644]  Dr. Joel Wallach, we're going to hold you a little bit over if you can do it.
[01:57:18.644 --> 01:57:28.815]  If you've got to jump, I understand you're a busy man, but what do you make of Angelina Jolie having her ovaries removed, again saying because she's genetically bad, what's really going on there?
[01:57:28.815 --> 01:57:30.097]  Having her breasts cut off as well.
[01:57:30.097 --> 01:57:31.739]  A lot of women going and having this done now.
[01:57:33.052 --> 01:57:36.433]  Well, I appreciated when you introduced that at the beginning of your show today.
[01:57:36.433 --> 01:57:40.614]  You said, well, next thing is she'll have her brain taken out to avoid brain cancer.
[01:57:40.614 --> 01:57:42.675]  Yes.
[01:57:42.675 --> 01:57:44.516]  I've been saying the same thing for years.
[01:57:44.516 --> 01:57:46.396]  I know, that's where I heard it.
[01:57:46.396 --> 01:57:48.297]  I listen to your show.
[01:57:48.297 --> 01:57:48.997]  Okay.
[01:57:48.997 --> 01:57:55.479]  Well, basically, this is a thing where the medical doctors are using people's fears to just get work.
[01:57:56.480 --> 01:57:59.403]  And it's a tragic thing.
[01:57:59.403 --> 01:58:09.134]  And actually, if you look at the title, the subtitle of the book, Epigenetics, The Death of the Genetic Theory of Disease Transmission, there are no genetically transmitted diseases.
[01:58:09.134 --> 01:58:18.064]  Your genes, let's say you have the potential to live to be 200 cancer free, but you're living on soft drinks and hot dogs and cake and popcorn.
[01:58:18.704 --> 01:58:25.007]  And you're going to, as you pointed out very well, very well done, that you're going to dive something at 36.
[01:58:25.007 --> 01:58:27.068]  Your grandparents have the same genes.
[01:58:27.068 --> 01:58:30.729]  They lived to be 102, but they didn't do all the bad things you did.
[01:58:30.729 --> 01:58:33.551]  Break down the difference when we come back.
[01:58:33.551 --> 01:58:34.411]  70 seconds.
[01:58:34.411 --> 01:58:34.751]  Absolutely.
[01:58:34.751 --> 01:58:36.312]  Infowarshealth.com, folks.
[01:58:36.312 --> 01:58:37.212]  Get the Alex back.
[01:58:37.212 --> 01:58:37.873]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:37.873 --> 01:58:40.674]  Stay with us.
[01:58:40.674 --> 01:58:42.655]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:42.655 --> 01:58:43.175]  70 seconds, folks.
[01:58:43.175 --> 01:58:43.955]  Stay with us.
[01:58:43.955 --> 01:58:45.916]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:45.916 --> 01:58:47.777]  I think she already had her brain removed.
[01:58:50.140 --> 01:58:51.401]  Another major health threat.
[01:58:51.401 --> 01:58:56.363]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:58:56.363 --> 01:58:59.044]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:58:59.044 --> 01:59:06.087]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:59:06.087 --> 01:59:09.068]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:59:09.068 --> 01:59:12.109]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:59:12.109 --> 01:59:14.050]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:59:14.050 --> 01:59:16.891]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:59:16.971 --> 01:59:22.694]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:59:22.694 --> 01:59:26.215]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:59:26.215 --> 01:59:29.297]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:59:29.297 --> 01:59:36.620]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[01:59:46.726 --> 01:59:47.949]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:05.990 --> 02:00:07.291]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.291 --> 02:00:09.052]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.052 --> 02:00:10.814]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.814 --> 02:00:12.395]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.395 --> 02:00:13.956]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.956 --> 02:00:17.398]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.398 --> 02:00:19.020]  We are trailblazing.
[02:00:19.020 --> 02:00:20.481]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[02:00:21.381 --> 02:00:22.382]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.382 --> 02:00:29.288]  Whether it's defending private property, the family, the Second Amendment, sovereignty, health information, we're about empowering people.
[02:00:29.288 --> 02:00:41.797]  The biggest thing we can do is drink filtered water, get the nutrients we need, exercise, and then love our families, love our neighbors, and build a better world and engage in independent free market activities and vote with our dollars to support folks that promote freedom.
[02:00:41.797 --> 02:00:43.579]  We do that, we can beat the globalists.
[02:00:43.579 --> 02:00:45.280]  Dr. Joel Wallach, I've been running over you.
[02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:48.323]  You've got the floor for the rest of this short segment and a little bit into the next.
[02:00:49.043 --> 02:00:54.247]  Please continue with your breakdown of Angelina Jolie, you know, because her mother had cancer and the rest of it.
[02:00:54.247 --> 02:00:56.268]  First it's her breasts, then her ovaries.
[02:00:56.268 --> 02:00:58.289]  That's what I said last year when she had her breasts removed.
[02:00:58.289 --> 02:01:01.291]  Will she remove all sexual tissue next?
[02:01:01.291 --> 02:01:06.034]  I mean, it's just tough because, you know, that's where she has the quote, pre-distribution.
[02:01:06.034 --> 02:01:08.576]  I mean, what should she do instead of removing her ovaries?
[02:01:10.148 --> 02:01:13.290]  Well, there's two things that cause cancer, Alex.
[02:01:13.290 --> 02:01:31.664]  Number one is that people eat the bad stuff that create and initiate and stimulate the genesis or the cause of cancer and then they eat bad things that drive it faster and they don't take the 90 cents of nutrients which will support their immune system to protect them from cancer.
[02:01:31.664 --> 02:01:32.085]  For instance,
[02:01:32.765 --> 02:01:36.566]  There's a wonderful study that came out in 1998 by the University of South Carolina.
[02:01:36.566 --> 02:01:37.927]  Big, big study.
[02:01:37.927 --> 02:01:40.807]  And all they did was look at the way the women cooked their food.
[02:01:40.807 --> 02:01:47.930]  And women who ate their meat cooked well done, just very well done, where the fat was burnt and crunchy.
[02:01:47.930 --> 02:01:48.870]  It's tasty.
[02:01:48.870 --> 02:01:50.110]  People like that.
[02:01:50.110 --> 02:01:53.451]  It increased the risk of breast cancer by 462%.
[02:01:53.451 --> 02:01:57.413]  If they cooked their meat medium rare, it reduced the risk of breast cancer by 462%.
[02:01:59.434 --> 02:02:14.284]  And then when you look at supplementation with certain minerals, Dr. Gerhard Schrauser, who's one of the third authors of the book, Heavy Genetics, a great guy, he discovered the essentiality of vitamin, excuse me, of the mineral selenium.
[02:02:14.284 --> 02:02:20.168]  And he did a wonderful study on selenium and breast cancer.
[02:02:20.168 --> 02:02:29.174]  And he came out and said, hey, all cancers, you can reduce your risk of prostate cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer by 82% by supplementing with 200 micrograms of selenium every day.
[02:02:29.914 --> 02:02:44.498]  And so between supplementing with antioxidants, things like resveratrol, quercetin, tumeric, vitamin C, vitamin A, beta carotene, and then you throw in minerals like gallium to prevent brain cancer.
[02:02:44.498 --> 02:02:49.520]  Enormous numbers of studies in England that had very large amounts of brain cancer in children.
[02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:54.621]  They supplemented the pregnant women with gallium and they didn't get brain cancer in the kids anymore.
[02:02:54.621 --> 02:02:56.942]  Big stuff and all this is in the book Epigenetics.
[02:02:57.862 --> 02:03:10.113]  And so all these things, where they form these groups, where they raise money for the research to find the gene, it's absolutely fraudulent stuff because there's not a single gene that actually causes any disease.
[02:03:10.113 --> 02:03:15.297]  The genes are a potential for health up to 200, maybe beyond 200 years.
[02:03:15.297 --> 02:03:22.444]  You give your genes, your DNA, your RNA, and your telomeres, little end caps in your chromosome, everything they need, the 90 central nutrients, you're going to
[02:03:22.984 --> 02:03:27.126]  Maximize your genetic potential for longevity and for health and fending off disease.
[02:03:27.126 --> 02:03:37.571]  But if you live on these diet drinks and eat a lot of sugar and eat a lot of fried foods, that's why there's no pastors who tend to be very religious or truthfully very religious people.
[02:03:37.571 --> 02:03:38.252]  They love God.
[02:03:38.252 --> 02:03:46.176]  And they all die in their 60s, 70s, and 80s because everybody, because they love them so much, give them fried chicken after church every Sunday.
[02:03:46.906 --> 02:03:48.127]  And that's what kills them.
[02:03:48.127 --> 02:03:54.190]  And if they would avoid the fried chicken and take the Alex back every day, we'd have pastures living to be beyond 100, which is the way it's supposed to be.
[02:03:54.190 --> 02:03:57.212]  It's just that simple.
[02:03:57.212 --> 02:04:04.837]  In the animal industry, we've eliminated 900 different diseases using these 90 essential nutrients that still plague people.
[02:04:04.837 --> 02:04:14.382]  In 2012, there was a wonderful study in Food Chemistry, a very well-respected scientific journal, where they normally look at the nutritional value of our foods plus the pollutant loads in foods.
[02:04:14.382 --> 02:04:15.103]  I read it every month.
[02:04:15.643 --> 02:04:28.513]  And that particular issue, April 16, 2012, they said commercially available baby foods like Similac, things like Gerber's, Infimil, others, have less than 20% of the required minerals and vitamins for kids.
[02:04:28.513 --> 02:04:30.075]  Well, that's why our kids are going to die before us.
[02:04:30.635 --> 02:04:30.975]  Our children are.
[02:04:30.975 --> 02:04:35.659]  And that's why the rock queues are dropping and why they're so stupid and why the cancer is exploding.
[02:04:35.659 --> 02:04:36.059]  That's right.
[02:04:36.059 --> 02:04:37.580]  And all the studies you mentioned are in the book.
[02:04:37.580 --> 02:04:44.806]  They've been all over the news that if you burn your meat it's going to give you colon cancer, breast cancer, but people just don't want to listen.
[02:04:44.806 --> 02:04:48.829]  Everybody should go to InfoWarsStore.com and get the book Epigenetics.
[02:04:48.829 --> 02:04:55.614]  Everyone should go to InfoWarsHealth.com, InfoWarsTeam.com and sign up to be distributors and get 30% off.
[02:04:55.614 --> 02:04:56.855]  I mean, this is just a no-brainer.
[02:04:56.855 --> 02:04:57.896]  I've got a few final questions.
[02:04:57.896 --> 02:04:59.037]  Dr. Wallach and Gerald Cilente.
[02:04:59.901 --> 02:05:00.822]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:05:00.822 --> 02:05:01.383]  Good, brother.
[02:05:01.383 --> 02:05:03.126]  Just recently started using your products.
[02:05:03.126 --> 02:05:05.069]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:05:05.069 --> 02:05:09.115]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:05:09.115 --> 02:05:11.718]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[02:05:11.718 --> 02:05:14.142]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:05:14.142 --> 02:05:16.185]  Super Mill Vitality was developed.
[02:05:16.425 --> 02:05:22.189]  To activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:05:22.189 --> 02:05:25.552]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[02:05:25.552 --> 02:05:27.073]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[02:05:27.073 --> 02:05:30.115]  We've gotten off the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[02:05:30.115 --> 02:05:31.776]  Saving a ton of money there.
[02:05:31.776 --> 02:05:34.218]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[02:05:34.718 --> 02:05:34.998]  We're good.
[02:05:59.881 --> 02:06:04.483]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[02:06:04.483 --> 02:06:10.846]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.
[02:06:10.846 --> 02:06:20.270]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance to create superior vitality in males and females.

[02:06:29.790 --> 02:06:33.452]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:06:33.452 --> 02:06:37.734]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:06:37.734 --> 02:06:39.515]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:06:39.515 --> 02:06:47.379]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:06:47.379 --> 02:06:48.520]  But for how long?

[02:06:55.143 --> 02:06:57.965]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.

[02:07:09.184 --> 02:07:13.867]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[02:07:13.867 --> 02:07:18.270]  It is produced by extracting oil from healthy nutrient-dense plants known as lichens.
[02:07:18.650 --> 02:07:21.693]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[02:07:21.693 --> 02:07:24.115]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[02:07:24.115 --> 02:07:27.678]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.

[02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:53.701]  Something the globalists are targeting.
[02:07:53.701 --> 02:07:56.324]  Visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[02:08:08.467 --> 02:08:11.208]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[02:08:11.208 --> 02:08:13.509]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:37.284]  Every time I hear this song and those voices, it's so beautiful, it's like angels.
[02:08:37.284 --> 02:08:42.606]  That's right, folks.
[02:08:42.606 --> 02:08:52.371]  To keep me from trying to get to you and warn you about what the globalists are doing, the people perish for lack of knowledge, we are gaining the knowledge to counter their globalist operations.
[02:08:52.371 --> 02:08:57.734]  In fact, crank it up for a minute, I gotta listen to this.
[02:09:01.751 --> 02:09:04.112]  And look what we've done in 20 years.
[02:09:04.112 --> 02:09:13.695]  We've built a major operation reaching upwards of 20 million people a week now.
[02:09:17.119 --> 02:09:22.742]  We've got the globalist Obama, the White House, Army Times countering us, Bloomberg.
[02:09:22.742 --> 02:09:24.583]  We're being attacked every day.
[02:09:24.583 --> 02:09:25.183]  It's wonderful.
[02:09:25.183 --> 02:09:26.564]  Praise God.
[02:09:26.564 --> 02:09:29.465]  Because we are having a massive effect telling the truth.
[02:09:29.465 --> 02:09:36.328]  Coming up after our guest leaves us, CNN reporter bowls to raise money for abortions, sparking outrage.
[02:09:36.328 --> 02:09:39.690]  She's mocking critics who call bowling for abortions disgusting.
[02:09:40.575 --> 02:09:43.716]  Yeah, the archetype is knocking those babies down.
[02:09:43.716 --> 02:09:46.337]  God's gonna cut you down, don't you worry, scum.
[02:09:46.337 --> 02:09:50.978]  Continuing, Angelina Jolie has ovaries removed, we were talking about that.
[02:09:50.978 --> 02:09:55.420]  Army and MSN launched this InfoSop against American people, that's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:09:55.420 --> 02:10:01.001]  It's in the Army Times, Stars and Stripes, foreign newspapers.
[02:10:01.001 --> 02:10:05.583]  And coming up, Gerald Cilente, law lets IRS seize accounts on suspicion, no crime reported.
[02:10:06.536 --> 02:10:07.296]  Required.
[02:10:07.296 --> 02:10:08.697]  That's the New York Times.
[02:10:08.697 --> 02:10:11.598]  Here's our story up on DrugsReport.com.
[02:10:11.598 --> 02:10:17.821]  Feds urge banks to call cops on customers who withdraw $5,000 or more.
[02:10:17.821 --> 02:10:21.002]  We'll give you details of that coming up.
[02:10:21.002 --> 02:10:25.804]  And we've got the clip of the whole Sharia law stuff up in a suburb of Dallas.
[02:10:25.804 --> 02:10:27.185]  That's coming up as well.
[02:10:27.185 --> 02:10:30.166]  Gerald Cilente to cover the waterfront joining us.
[02:10:30.166 --> 02:10:32.627]  Putting bookends on this with Dr. Joel Wallach.
[02:10:34.850 --> 02:10:40.713]  Who is the best-selling author of Dead Doctors Don't Lie, that we sell at Infowars, store.com, and Epigenetics.
[02:10:40.713 --> 02:10:44.715]  Everybody should read Epigenetics, The Death of the Genetic Theory of Disease and Transmission.
[02:10:44.715 --> 02:10:49.958]  Everyone needs to know that genetics loads the gun, environment pulls the trigger.
[02:10:49.958 --> 02:10:53.079]  And that it's not, oh, everybody's getting cancer because we got bad genes.
[02:10:53.079 --> 02:10:55.200]  You got the same genes as your grandparents.
[02:10:55.200 --> 02:10:58.042]  In your grandparents' day, there was not cancer in children.
[02:10:58.042 --> 02:10:59.042]  Didn't exist.
[02:10:59.042 --> 02:11:04.245]  It was like finding a lucky leprechaun riding a unicorn for doctors to go study it.
[02:11:05.006 --> 02:11:07.106]  Now it is pandemic.
[02:11:07.106 --> 02:11:08.647]  Epidemic everywhere.
[02:11:08.647 --> 02:11:13.227]  You can't throw a dart and not hit some kid with cancer.
[02:11:13.227 --> 02:11:22.309]  And Dr. Joel Wallach has been breaking it down from his zoological studies as a top government veterinarian when he discovered this in animals.
[02:11:22.309 --> 02:11:25.970]  And then he went off and got degrees and the rest of it to be working on humans.
[02:11:25.970 --> 02:11:30.390]  And he of course has hundreds of millions of copies of his books and CDs are out there.
[02:11:30.390 --> 02:11:32.231]  He's made a major effect.
[02:11:32.231 --> 02:11:33.131]  And if you just joined us
[02:11:34.011 --> 02:11:36.933]  His organization in the last 30 years has sued.
[02:11:36.933 --> 02:11:38.194]  We've had his lawyers on.
[02:11:38.194 --> 02:11:43.157]  They're rated as the top lawyers that go after the FDA.
[02:11:43.157 --> 02:11:44.458]  Eight times!
[02:11:44.458 --> 02:11:48.040]  You want to know who's helped in Congress save the supplement industry?
[02:11:48.040 --> 02:11:49.762]  And save medical choices?
[02:11:49.762 --> 02:11:53.744]  And save your rights to get to herbs?
[02:11:53.744 --> 02:11:54.905]  Dr. Wallach, longevity.
[02:11:54.905 --> 02:11:57.207]  That's another reason to shop at Infowarshealth.com.
[02:11:58.069 --> 02:12:09.639]  Because you're supporting my broadcast, you're supporting their organization, you get 30% off the retail that's listed there when you sign up to be a distributor, you can get free shipping when you sign up for AutoShop, and you're supporting on every front victory.
[02:12:10.376 --> 02:12:12.437]  So thank you all for your support.
[02:12:12.437 --> 02:12:13.857]  Dr. Wallach, you've got two or three minutes.
[02:12:13.857 --> 02:12:15.118]  I know you've got to go.
[02:12:15.118 --> 02:12:18.199]  Put bookends on what we're talking about here and what we're dealing with.
[02:12:18.199 --> 02:12:19.860]  And as you said, we've got to take over.
[02:12:19.860 --> 02:12:21.280]  We've got to get aggressive.
[02:12:21.280 --> 02:12:24.142]  We've got to change our lives, change other people's lives.
[02:12:24.142 --> 02:12:36.547]  We've got to demonstrate, as we're doing, the truth with simple things like if you eat processed meat or heavily cooked meat, as you said, 500 plus percent increase in breast cancer or colon cancer, major studies.
[02:12:37.387 --> 02:12:40.653]  That is just, we're going to continue to put that information out to people.
[02:12:40.653 --> 02:12:43.898]  It doesn't matter what the government says.
[02:12:43.898 --> 02:12:46.002]  We appreciate you for that, Alex.
[02:12:46.002 --> 02:12:50.429]  You're definitely the warrior that's getting the information out and we can't thank you enough.
[02:12:51.304 --> 02:12:53.526]  We have to save our kids because they are our future.
[02:12:53.526 --> 02:12:55.107]  They're the future of America.
[02:12:55.107 --> 02:13:04.293]  And right now, experts are telling us, and I believe this, that if we don't do something about it, our kids will be the first generation who do not live as long as their parents in America.
[02:13:04.293 --> 02:13:06.875]  50% of Americans will be burying their children.
[02:13:06.875 --> 02:13:08.236]  It's just outrageous.
[02:13:08.236 --> 02:13:09.957]  We're supposed to have the best medical system in the world.
[02:13:09.957 --> 02:13:10.957]  No, we have the worst.
[02:13:10.957 --> 02:13:12.699]  We have the most expensive, but not the best.
[02:13:13.419 --> 02:13:16.500]  And to save our kids, we've got to get them on the 90 essential nutrients.
[02:13:16.500 --> 02:13:20.342]  And before they're conceived, alter the pregnancy they're developed in from the moment they're born.
[02:13:20.342 --> 02:13:27.785]  So when they get old enough to have their own kids, they will be steeped in these 90 essential nutrients to prevent every birth defect you can name and 10 times that many you can't.
[02:13:27.785 --> 02:13:29.245]  And we're talking about everything.
[02:13:29.245 --> 02:13:30.666]  We're talking about spina bifida.
[02:13:30.666 --> 02:13:32.106]  We're talking about cerebral palsy.
[02:13:32.106 --> 02:13:37.128]  We're talking about heart defects, cleft palate, cleft lip, cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy.
[02:13:37.128 --> 02:13:39.089]  We're talking about things like
[02:13:44.025 --> 02:13:50.590]  Okay, and so we're talking about every birth defect you can name, including transgender kids.
[02:13:50.590 --> 02:13:57.976]  These are actually made the third to seventh week of pregnancy because the mother's missing nutrients and this is preventable.
[02:13:57.976 --> 02:14:04.682]  Transgender kids are something, you gotta love them where they're at, but we don't necessarily have to have any more transgender kids born.
[02:14:05.322 --> 02:14:06.042]  Okay?
[02:14:06.042 --> 02:14:12.223]  And this is something, when somebody gets married, instead of giving them a set of towels with their monogram on it, you give them all 90 cents of nutrients.
[02:14:12.223 --> 02:14:16.224]  They get engaged, you give them all 90 cents of nutrients instead of a set of linens.
[02:14:16.224 --> 02:14:17.544]  And we will save America.
[02:14:17.544 --> 02:14:18.885]  This is so extreme.
[02:14:18.885 --> 02:14:22.445]  Next you're going to say that humans need oxygen and that plants need carbon dioxide.
[02:14:22.445 --> 02:14:26.786]  I mean, you're saying we need vitamin C and vitamin D and iodine?
[02:14:26.786 --> 02:14:28.747]  You're saying that we need selenium?
[02:14:28.747 --> 02:14:29.987]  I mean, this is...
[02:14:31.147 --> 02:14:34.269]  Well, it's like saying fish need water to live in.
[02:14:34.269 --> 02:14:35.149]  That is extreme.
[02:14:35.149 --> 02:14:40.652]  It's so bizarre that you would teach something alternative to the government.
[02:14:40.652 --> 02:14:42.613]  You're just an extremist.
[02:14:42.613 --> 02:14:50.958]  Well, just to kind of end it up in a sentence or two, doing what we're doing and just eating well, trying to get everything we need would be the same thing as putting Texas dirt into your car.
[02:14:50.958 --> 02:14:54.620]  Put six quarts of Texas dirt in your car instead of oil.
[02:14:54.620 --> 02:14:57.202]  And you say, well, there's probably some oil in there because it's Texas dirt.
[02:14:58.047 --> 02:15:01.568]  And that's how insane it is to just eat well and expect to get everything you need.
[02:15:01.568 --> 02:15:03.108]  Ask Steve Jobs how that worked for him.
[02:15:03.108 --> 02:15:18.012]  He died at 56 because he ate well, cooked everything in extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra,
[02:15:19.619 --> 02:15:21.460]  Well, the diet is no bad stuff.
[02:15:21.460 --> 02:15:29.042]  No fried foods, no processed meats with nitrates and nitrites, no oils including olive oil and coconut oil, absolutely no gluten, no wheat, barley, rye, and oats.
[02:15:29.042 --> 02:15:31.583]  And then you have to supplement with the 90% nutrients.
[02:15:31.583 --> 02:15:41.866]  There's zones on Earth, there's 20 places on Earth where people have them naturally in the soil, and they're still burning wood and taking the wood ashes and putting them in their gardens, so they're getting those minerals recycled.
[02:15:42.642 --> 02:15:58.255]  That ended for us, here in America, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, Monday, September 4th, 1882, when Thomas Edison pulled the switch on the first commercial electric generating plant, everybody flipped over to electricity, stopped burning wood, we had no more wood ashes to put in our garden, and that was the beginning of the end.
[02:15:58.255 --> 02:16:00.096]  In 1936, U.S.
[02:16:00.096 --> 02:16:02.378]  Senate Document 264 came out, U.S.
[02:16:02.378 --> 02:16:08.283]  Senate Document 264 came out, and said there's no longer enough nutritional minerals in our soil to support human health.
[02:16:09.943 --> 02:16:13.550]  So they started artificially adding just a few, but it's not what we need.
[02:16:13.550 --> 02:16:20.182]  Dr. Wallach of Dead Doctors Don't Lie, Fame, and of course the new book, Epigenetics, InfoWarsHealth.com.
[02:16:20.182 --> 02:16:20.923]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:16:21.766 --> 02:16:23.447]  Well, God bless you, Alex, for all the great stuff you do.
[02:16:23.447 --> 02:16:25.147]  Thank you so much for your hospitality.
[02:16:25.147 --> 02:16:27.808]  Look forward to working with you for another 100 years, buddy.
[02:16:27.808 --> 02:16:29.608]  All right, he's awesome.

[02:16:59.065 --> 02:17:10.294]  Okay, we're going to get Gerald Cilente on now for the balance of the hour, and I'm just going to go through news with him and get his take on all of it, but when I called to get him on today, and I appreciate him coming on on short notice,
[02:17:12.443 --> 02:17:24.533]  I did it because he's always getting really exercised and upset and should be about the IRS grabbing people's bank accounts because they make small cash deposits.
[02:17:24.533 --> 02:17:27.375]  That's not illegal.
[02:17:27.375 --> 02:17:28.977]  Or because they take cash out.
[02:17:28.977 --> 02:17:31.979]  The war on cash.
[02:17:31.979 --> 02:17:34.521]  I mean, we've had the government to harass us.
[02:17:35.390 --> 02:17:40.056]  When we go to Bilderberg and stuff, cancel our rent cars, cancel my credit cards.
[02:17:40.056 --> 02:17:43.800]  I'll take secret cards I open up right before, just so I have them.
[02:17:43.800 --> 02:17:50.528]  I give thousands of dollars to each crew member, because that's what they need just to get around and pay their bills.
[02:17:50.528 --> 02:17:52.170]  And you go to the bank and I go, yeah, I need $12,000 out.
[02:17:54.329 --> 02:17:56.150]  And they'll go, excuse me?
[02:17:56.150 --> 02:18:01.233]  And I go, we have hundreds of thousands of dollars of payroll going through your bank every few weeks.
[02:18:01.233 --> 02:18:03.534]  You're acting like I'm bad wanting $12,000?
[02:18:03.534 --> 02:18:06.255]  They get a bank manager over and, what's this for, Mr. Jones?
[02:18:06.255 --> 02:18:07.756]  I go, we gotta fill out a report.
[02:18:07.756 --> 02:18:10.637]  Fill out your suspicious person's report.
[02:18:10.637 --> 02:18:12.999]  I'm not gonna tell you what cash is.
[02:18:12.999 --> 02:18:14.539]  I pay the fake IRS tax.
[02:18:14.539 --> 02:18:16.060]  I jump through all the hoops.
[02:18:16.060 --> 02:18:17.961]  This is how they persecute people.
[02:18:17.961 --> 02:18:19.762]  The Tea Party, gun owners, you name it.
[02:18:19.762 --> 02:18:23.164]  We have to break the IRS and abolish them, not grovel to them.
[02:18:24.130 --> 02:18:29.453]  And the know-your-customer garbage that George Herbert Walker Bush got through, where they surveil every purchase you make.
[02:18:29.453 --> 02:18:32.134]  The government does, without warrants!
[02:18:32.134 --> 02:18:36.696]  And that's back in the news today, so I wanted to get Gerald Cilente on about that.
[02:18:36.696 --> 02:18:39.978]  Also, feds urge banks to call cops on customers.
[02:18:41.092 --> 02:18:44.176]  Who withdraw $5,000 or more.
[02:18:44.176 --> 02:18:46.179]  This is on Infowars.com.
[02:18:46.179 --> 02:18:48.842]  Infowars.com story by Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:18:48.842 --> 02:18:50.784]  Also on DrudgeReport.com.
[02:18:50.784 --> 02:18:56.171]  The Justice Department is ordering bank employees to consider calling the cops on customers who withdraw $5,000 or more.
[02:18:56.171 --> 02:18:58.835]  So now it's not even a fake know your customer, it's just call the cops.
[02:18:59.935 --> 02:19:03.137]  A chilling example of how the war on cash is intensifying.
[02:19:03.137 --> 02:19:13.844]  Banks are already required to file suspicious activity reports on their customers with threats of fines and even jail time for directors if financial institutions don't meet quotas.
[02:19:13.844 --> 02:19:24.551]  But as investor and financial blogger Simon Black points out last week, a quote senior official from the Justice Department spoke to a group of bankers about the need for them to rat out their customers to the police for stuff that's not illegal.
[02:19:25.882 --> 02:19:29.783]  But then they misapply and claim, well, I as an agent believe it's money laundering.
[02:19:29.783 --> 02:19:32.004]  So then they indict you off of their belief.
[02:19:32.004 --> 02:19:34.284]  Well, I believe you're Santa Claus.
[02:19:34.284 --> 02:19:35.965]  Doesn't mean it's true.
[02:19:35.965 --> 02:19:44.868]  Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell gave a speech in which she urged banks to, quote, alert law enforcement authorities about the problem so the police can seize the funds.
[02:19:44.868 --> 02:19:49.769]  See, because cops will say under federal asset forfeiture, $1,000 is something they're going to seize.
[02:19:50.009 --> 02:19:52.271]  Because they can test the money and find drugs on it.
[02:19:52.271 --> 02:19:53.992]  Almost all money has drugs on it.
[02:19:53.992 --> 02:19:55.814]  Or at least initiate an investigation.
[02:19:55.814 --> 02:19:58.716]  So, rat them out so we can bank rob them on the road when they leave.
[02:19:59.775 --> 02:20:02.376]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists.
[02:20:02.376 --> 02:20:03.476]  Get back to nature.

[02:20:29.221 --> 02:20:38.529]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:20:38.529 --> 02:20:39.329]  This capitalism?
[02:20:39.329 --> 02:20:45.494]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:20:45.494 --> 02:20:49.197]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[02:22:59.014 --> 02:23:05.755]  Usually the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[02:23:05.755 --> 02:23:10.136]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink, and you'll become wrinkled.
[02:23:10.136 --> 02:23:13.637]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[02:23:13.637 --> 02:23:14.777]  Not fun!
[02:23:14.777 --> 02:23:23.179]  However, if you can consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.

[02:23:28.280 --> 02:23:29.441]  My name is Errol.

[02:23:30.961 --> 02:23:33.542]  You know, the taste of One World Whey is amazing.
[02:23:33.542 --> 02:23:41.406]  I play pickleball, and since taking One World Whey and your trace mineral supplement, I have more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[02:23:41.406 --> 02:23:47.709]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results using One World Whey.
[02:23:47.709 --> 02:23:48.189]  Call 888-988-3325.

[02:24:09.445 --> 02:24:17.930]  Well, when I saw these stories in the New York Times and up on Infowars.com, feds urged banks to call cops on customers who withdraw $5,000 or more.
[02:24:17.930 --> 02:24:20.111]  I had to get Gerald Salente on.
[02:24:20.111 --> 02:24:26.695]  And they tell the cops, we're going to call you so you can pull them over and seize the cash when they leave, and it's your money.
[02:24:26.695 --> 02:24:30.618]  But they say, oh, under acid forfeiture seizure, it doesn't need to be illegal.
[02:24:32.298 --> 02:24:36.259]  And then almost all money has trace drugs on it, so that's their argument.
[02:24:36.259 --> 02:24:38.660]  And they're seizing old ladies' restaurants, you name it.
[02:24:38.660 --> 02:24:40.540]  That's in the New York Times.
[02:24:40.540 --> 02:24:42.821]  They had hearings on it last month, but they're not stopping.
[02:24:42.821 --> 02:24:46.182]  I want to thank the crew, by the way, for doing a great job.
[02:24:46.182 --> 02:24:48.043]  Cut to them in the TV studio.
[02:24:48.043 --> 02:24:55.225]  If you're radio listeners, you can go to infowars.com forward slash show, and you can see the crew in there doing a great job.
[02:24:56.308 --> 02:25:05.573]  But I wanted to get Gerald Cilente on about this and just the whole waterfront of what's going on because I've been doing this 23 years, 20 years on air.
[02:25:05.573 --> 02:25:09.896]  I was a guest on other shows and things 22 years ago, but I've been on air on my own show for 22 years.
[02:25:09.896 --> 02:25:13.958]  We're now seeing more tyranny in a week than I would see in six months previous.
[02:25:13.958 --> 02:25:23.084]  I mean, the power grabbing over the internet and over the borders imploding and global treaties that no one's allowed to see and just all of it.
[02:25:23.784 --> 02:25:28.769]  Police in Wisconsin to take DNA forcibly from anyone with a misdemeanor.
[02:25:28.769 --> 02:25:33.835]  Stories about police with the CIA now grabbing your data without warrants.
[02:25:33.835 --> 02:25:35.897]  I mean, this is all mainstream news.
[02:25:35.897 --> 02:25:39.220]  Gerald Solente, what in the world is going on?
[02:25:39.220 --> 02:25:40.662]  What are the elites doing?
[02:25:40.662 --> 02:25:43.224]  Because it's not just happening here, it's happening all over the world, and I know
[02:25:44.105 --> 02:25:46.647]  Your pet peeve is this war on cash.
[02:25:46.647 --> 02:25:53.311]  They want us cashless so they can put global taxes, currency taxes, money transfer taxes, and track everything we do.
[02:25:53.311 --> 02:25:55.292]  They want to illegally surveil us.
[02:25:55.292 --> 02:25:57.633]  I guess now putting your blinds down will be illegal.
[02:25:57.633 --> 02:25:59.835]  I mean, it is not illegal to get cash.
[02:25:59.835 --> 02:26:00.655]  What is going on?
[02:26:00.655 --> 02:26:03.417]  I know you've really written about this and talked about this.
[02:26:03.417 --> 02:26:05.038]  Internal capital controls.
[02:26:06.271 --> 02:26:15.958]  Well, on the money end, you know, I wrote back in 2009, when things were really shaky, I tried taking money out of a key bank over here.
[02:26:15.958 --> 02:26:24.023]  We did a story in the Trends Journal about how they harassed me and had me sign all these papers.
[02:26:25.044 --> 02:26:27.345]  And I had to put up a fuss to get my money.
[02:26:27.345 --> 02:26:31.987]  And then, back in, as a matter of fact, I even did it on your show.
[02:26:31.987 --> 02:26:37.629]  A few years later, it happened to me again at HSBC.
[02:26:37.629 --> 02:26:40.150]  Oh, it was an ugly picture.
[02:26:40.150 --> 02:26:41.670]  I threatened to call the police.
[02:26:41.670 --> 02:26:43.971]  They would not give me my money.
[02:26:43.971 --> 02:26:44.971]  And it was well over $5,000.
[02:26:47.617 --> 02:26:51.158]  And they kept asking me what I was going to use the money for.
[02:26:51.158 --> 02:26:55.178]  And I kept saying, none of your business.
[02:26:55.178 --> 02:26:57.459]  Who do you think you are?
[02:26:57.459 --> 02:27:02.100]  You didn't ask me where I got the money from when I put it in your bank.
[02:27:02.100 --> 02:27:03.460]  How dare you ask me?
[02:27:03.460 --> 02:27:06.961]  This went on for almost a day.
[02:27:06.961 --> 02:27:11.002]  Then, you start adding up the pieces. 2011.
[02:27:14.130 --> 02:27:21.096]  Halloween night, the perfect time for the clowns to pull a dirty trick.
[02:27:21.096 --> 02:27:40.251]  John the Slime Corzine, everybody's Democratic lovely boy from Jersey, former head of the Goldman Sachs gang, a low-life piece of garbage who gets a free ride for bringing down MF Global.
[02:27:40.251 --> 02:27:41.992]  Remember I had my money with them?
[02:27:42.893 --> 02:27:44.915]  And I couldn't get it out.
[02:27:44.915 --> 02:27:50.460]  And then they ended up taking a good, not a huge part, but a piece of it.
[02:27:50.460 --> 02:27:53.763]  And it only took me a couple of years to get it back.
[02:27:53.763 --> 02:27:56.145]  And I told the story of what happened on 9-11.
[02:27:58.083 --> 02:28:04.089]  When I saw the trade towers coming down, the first thing I did, I picked up the phone.
[02:28:04.089 --> 02:28:07.712]  I had money in fleet banks, certificates of deposit.
[02:28:07.712 --> 02:28:13.758]  In those days, Alex, they used to have a thing called interest rates, where you could make money on them.
[02:28:13.758 --> 02:28:16.700]  So I had our company's money in CDs.
[02:28:17.521 --> 02:28:19.762]  Up in Fleet Bank, up in Boston.
[02:28:19.762 --> 02:28:21.624]  I said, oh, this is Mr. Sellenti.
[02:28:21.624 --> 02:28:25.746]  I'd like my money transferred to the Rhinebeck, my Rhinebeck account.
[02:28:25.746 --> 02:28:30.229]  Because I don't know, I'm watching the trade towers come down.
[02:28:30.229 --> 02:28:33.391]  Hey, something they never talk about!
[02:28:33.391 --> 02:28:35.792]  All those military guys.
[02:28:35.792 --> 02:28:38.474]  Remember somebody whacked the Pentagon?
[02:28:38.474 --> 02:28:39.975]  Yeah, I remember that one too!
[02:28:40.535 --> 02:28:48.677]  So I don't know if there's going to be a nuclear explosion on one of the rotted power plants on the Hudson River, Indian Point.
[02:28:48.677 --> 02:28:51.358]  So if that happens, I want to get out of here.
[02:28:51.358 --> 02:28:58.380]  So I want to get my money, you know, Gerald Slenty's, GC's, 3G's, guns, gold, and a getaway plan.
[02:28:58.380 --> 02:29:02.061]  I'm going to head to Canada, four and a half hours away from here.
[02:29:02.061 --> 02:29:04.362]  From Canada, I could go anywhere.
[02:29:04.362 --> 02:29:06.703]  So they say to me before I give them my
[02:29:07.643 --> 02:29:09.645]  Wire transfer information.
[02:29:09.645 --> 02:29:15.489]  Mr. Salenti, certificates of deposit are financial instruments.
[02:29:15.489 --> 02:29:18.531]  And Wall Street is closed.
[02:29:18.531 --> 02:29:21.113]  You can't get your money.
[02:29:21.113 --> 02:29:23.175]  Three strikes, you're out.
[02:29:23.175 --> 02:29:26.297]  I got three strikes against me.
[02:29:26.297 --> 02:29:27.738]  They wouldn't give me my money on 9-11?
[02:29:29.601 --> 02:29:34.284]  HSBC slimers wouldn't give me my money.
[02:29:34.284 --> 02:29:39.388]  The Key Bank low-lifes... And Corzine grabbed your money, so that's four strikes.
[02:29:39.388 --> 02:29:40.429]  Stay there.
[02:29:40.429 --> 02:29:42.230]  We're gonna come back and talk about the big picture.
[02:29:42.230 --> 02:29:47.433]  The hell of a cashless robo-apocalypse when everything is digital.
[02:29:47.433 --> 02:29:50.315]  The Mark of the Beast with Gerald Salenta.
[02:29:50.315 --> 02:29:52.857]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.857 --> 02:29:55.539]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.106 --> 02:30:09.093]  Sold out for weeks through the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[02:30:09.093 --> 02:30:19.620]  This ultra-clean Vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[02:30:19.620 --> 02:30:25.705]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:30:26.045 --> 02:30:32.451]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:30:32.451 --> 02:30:35.513]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[02:30:35.513 --> 02:30:41.058]  And adenosylcobalamin, the most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.
[02:30:41.058 --> 02:30:44.141]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:30:44.141 --> 02:30:45.682]  No needles, no injections.
[02:30:45.682 --> 02:30:47.063]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:30:47.063 --> 02:30:48.264]  Try it for yourself.
[02:30:48.264 --> 02:30:49.245]  Discover the secret.
[02:30:49.245 --> 02:30:49.385]  Secret 12.
[02:30:50.666 --> 02:30:53.008]  Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited.

[02:31:35.236 --> 02:31:39.179]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[02:31:39.179 --> 02:31:45.383]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[02:31:45.783 --> 02:31:50.924]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[02:31:50.924 --> 02:31:54.645]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.

[02:31:58.446 --> 02:32:03.187]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:32:03.187 --> 02:32:08.148]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[02:32:08.168 --> 02:32:08.508]  I don't know.
[02:32:29.727 --> 02:32:34.349]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[02:32:34.349 --> 02:32:40.692]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.

[02:33:04.927 --> 02:33:06.709]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:06.709 --> 02:33:12.373]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:33:12.373 --> 02:33:17.258]  One of the big signposts of living in a hardcore tyranny is capital controls.
[02:33:17.258 --> 02:33:19.940]  And the TSA now admits that's going to be part of their job.
[02:33:19.940 --> 02:33:28.207]  They claim if the IRS has an investigation going on you, not an indictment, not a criminal investigation, just has your name in a file, you won't be able to fly out of the country.
[02:33:29.571 --> 02:33:31.973]  Now they're talking about if you haven't had vaccines, you can't fly.
[02:33:31.973 --> 02:33:33.715]  It's all outside of law.
[02:33:33.715 --> 02:33:38.098]  And the New York Times comes out and says, yeah, they take old lady's money with no criminal records.
[02:33:38.098 --> 02:33:41.161]  And even after tax money, the IRS just takes their accounts.
[02:33:41.161 --> 02:33:43.383]  Tens of thousands of people a year.
[02:33:43.383 --> 02:33:45.365]  And now the feds are giving speeches.
[02:33:47.108 --> 02:33:53.352]  Assistant Attorney General Leslie Cadwell gave a speech when she urged banks to alert law enforcement authorities about a problem.
[02:33:53.352 --> 02:33:57.535]  This is a quote, so that police can, quote, seize the funds or at least initiate an investigation.
[02:33:57.535 --> 02:34:02.198]  So the cops pull you over, just grab the money out of your car, and then the feds get 20% of it, locals get 80%.
[02:34:02.198 --> 02:34:04.959]  That's federalization.
[02:34:04.959 --> 02:34:15.186]  As Black highlights, according to the handbook for the Federal Financial Institution Examination Council, such suspicious activity includes transactions conducted or attempted by, at the bank or an affiliate,
[02:34:16.260 --> 02:34:24.446]  And aggregating 5,000 or more, people think it's still 10, so they get under that like they're trying to hide when you're doing nothing wrong.
[02:34:24.446 --> 02:34:29.090]  You'd be insane not to have 5-10% of your cash, you know, in a safe or something.
[02:34:29.090 --> 02:34:37.076]  Black provides a chilling scenario under which an attempt to withdraw your own money from your bank account could end with a home visit from the cops.
[02:34:37.076 --> 02:34:39.739]  And they go through it, how they're doing it.
[02:34:39.739 --> 02:34:42.501]  And again, under asset forfeiture seizure and the drug laws,
[02:34:44.417 --> 02:34:46.637]  You see these cases where the cops pull you over.
[02:34:46.637 --> 02:34:49.838]  It's usually really corrupt jurisdictions that fully do this.
[02:34:49.838 --> 02:34:51.918]  And it'll be an old lady and they'll say, what's in your purse?
[02:34:51.918 --> 02:34:56.799]  And they'll see $2,000, knowing old ladies carry a lot of cash, because they're smart, from the Depression.
[02:34:56.799 --> 02:34:57.859]  And they'll just take it.
[02:34:57.859 --> 02:34:59.180]  Say, if you don't like it, go see the judge.
[02:34:59.180 --> 02:35:01.400]  The judge will say, we're going to test that, man.
[02:35:01.400 --> 02:35:03.080]  This has come out on the news hundreds of times.
[02:35:03.080 --> 02:35:07.281]  We find any drug residue, we're going to take your car and indict you.
[02:35:07.281 --> 02:35:12.282]  Because the federal law says we can, which it really doesn't, but they misinterpret and have kept juries that'll do it.
[02:35:13.986 --> 02:35:16.269]  And a lot of times they say, okay, go ahead and do it.
[02:35:16.269 --> 02:35:17.691]  Then they'll test the money.
[02:35:17.691 --> 02:35:19.953]  And of course, almost all money has some drug residues on it.
[02:35:19.953 --> 02:35:22.376]  And they'll say, all right, we're indicting you.
[02:35:22.376 --> 02:35:24.759]  My cousins are all on the jury.
[02:35:24.759 --> 02:35:25.900]  And that's what goes on.
[02:35:26.704 --> 02:35:29.385]  From upstate New York to East Texas.
[02:35:29.385 --> 02:35:30.966]  And those are the bad cops.
[02:35:30.966 --> 02:35:33.627]  And the feds wrote it all, they did it all.
[02:35:33.627 --> 02:35:35.308]  It is beyond boss hog.
[02:35:35.308 --> 02:35:36.989]  And Roscoe Pico train.
[02:35:36.989 --> 02:35:39.010]  Those are angels compared to this.
[02:35:39.010 --> 02:35:43.392]  And then the big banks, pull up Bloomberg, $378 billion.
[02:35:43.392 --> 02:35:45.933]  Wells Fargo, Wachovia, laundered drug money.
[02:35:45.933 --> 02:35:51.495]  Didn't even get in trouble from 2005 to 2008 when they got quote caught.
[02:35:51.495 --> 02:35:54.457]  I mean, they were leasing and running the drug aircraft.
[02:35:55.233 --> 02:36:01.076]  You know, the cops will be out here looking for drugs on the street when the big banks are laundering the money by the trillions every decade.
[02:36:01.076 --> 02:36:03.097]  500 billion dollars a year in drug money in the U.S.
[02:36:03.097 --> 02:36:03.998]  alone.
[02:36:03.998 --> 02:36:06.499]  Our troops load it on the C-130s and fly it here.
[02:36:06.499 --> 02:36:08.640]  When they couldn't hide it anymore, they just put it on the news.
[02:36:08.640 --> 02:36:11.522]  Going back to Gerald Cilente, this is about social control.
[02:36:12.182 --> 02:36:14.965]  Well, whether people believe in the Bible or not, it's the same thing.
[02:36:14.965 --> 02:36:21.854]  Where everything's tracked, everything's traced, everything's looked at by the NSA, all these other agencies, they follow everything you do.
[02:36:21.854 --> 02:36:31.725]  They built back doors into everything, letting the hackers get into the back doors and create all the financial crises we see, with credit cards getting cancelled every few weeks now, and debit cards.
[02:36:32.506 --> 02:36:46.575]  So cashless is a disaster, and then if we want to have cash, because it's fun to give somebody a tip in cash, or fun to, you know, give bonuses in cash at Christmas, I'm supposedly dirty to take after-tax money and give it to people.
[02:36:46.575 --> 02:36:48.015]  I mean, this is so sick.
[02:36:48.015 --> 02:36:50.537]  We live in a prison in this country.
[02:36:50.537 --> 02:36:53.058]  It's like Forbes saying the war on lemonade stands.
[02:36:53.058 --> 02:36:54.339]  They don't want barter.
[02:36:54.339 --> 02:36:55.560]  They don't want grassroots.
[02:36:55.560 --> 02:36:57.041]  What's really behind it, Gerald Cilente?
[02:36:58.149 --> 02:37:08.131]  I believe that this latest issue about notifying the police with withdrawals is fear of a banking crisis.
[02:37:08.131 --> 02:37:12.512]  And that's why I was relating to what has happened to me in the past.
[02:37:12.512 --> 02:37:18.933]  They cannot afford to run on the banks because there is no dough in the banks to really cover this.
[02:37:18.933 --> 02:37:22.914]  You look what happened, Alex, at the end of 2014, when all of a sudden,
[02:37:26.175 --> 02:37:31.881]  Jamie Legs Diamond over there from the JP Morgan Chase Gang.
[02:37:33.087 --> 02:37:44.358]  Actually gave Congress the language to put in about credit default swaps to be part of the balance sheet in banks.
[02:37:44.358 --> 02:37:55.848]  So essentially all these trillions in derivatives and credit default swaps that the banks are gambling with, now they're covered by supposedly FDIC.
[02:37:57.950 --> 02:38:13.086]  And then you add on top of that the legislation with the bail-ins that allows the banks to grab your dough if it can't be covered by insurance.
[02:38:13.086 --> 02:38:20.193]  I believe that this is being done to dissuade people from taking their money out of banks
[02:38:21.443 --> 02:38:23.605]  And to penalize them when they do.
[02:38:23.605 --> 02:38:28.909]  Because I believe there's going... And, you know, it's not only me.
[02:38:28.909 --> 02:38:30.490]  It's Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:38:30.490 --> 02:38:33.612]  Well, we've seen the bail-ins in Cyprus and other areas.
[02:38:33.612 --> 02:38:36.034]  This is the globalist model everywhere else they've been.
[02:38:36.034 --> 02:38:39.216]  I mean, Obama's talking about tax increases by executive order.
[02:38:39.216 --> 02:38:40.017]  Totally illegal.
[02:38:40.017 --> 02:38:42.398]  They're talking about grabbing education funds.
[02:38:42.398 --> 02:38:43.599]  Calling them trust funds.
[02:38:43.599 --> 02:38:46.662]  I mean, they are really gearing up, Gerald.
[02:38:46.662 --> 02:38:47.382]  Exactly.
[02:38:47.382 --> 02:38:50.524]  And again, you look at David Stockman's work.
[02:38:50.524 --> 02:38:50.925]  All of us.
[02:38:51.530 --> 02:38:55.672]  We're all saying that this Ponzi scheme is going to collapse.
[02:38:55.672 --> 02:39:01.856]  You see what happens, Alex, even when they hint about raising interest rates.
[02:39:01.856 --> 02:39:10.441]  The market goes into panic because the low interest rates have allowed this Ponzi scheme to continue to go.
[02:39:10.441 --> 02:39:17.765]  And now they're doing it, of course, over in Europe with their quantitative easing.
[02:39:17.765 --> 02:39:19.306]  It's one country after another.
[02:39:20.006 --> 02:39:24.027]  So what we're saying is, this is going to collapse.
[02:39:24.027 --> 02:39:26.927]  When it collapses, there's going to be panic.
[02:39:26.927 --> 02:39:29.908]  When there's panic, people will go to the banks.
[02:39:29.908 --> 02:39:30.368]  That's right.
[02:39:30.368 --> 02:39:34.569]  When they go to the banks, they're going to get nothing.
[02:39:34.569 --> 02:39:39.210]  Well, it's clear that we've got a lot of special interests that are out of control, and I've studied history.
[02:39:39.210 --> 02:39:40.950]  Elites always think they're invincible.
[02:39:40.950 --> 02:39:46.692]  The white shoeboys that you call them, the Harvard gang, there's no way they're going to get away with this.
[02:39:46.692 --> 02:39:48.192]  I mean, they're even training, Gerald.
[02:39:49.329 --> 02:39:53.393]  To have the military take over domestically, as you know, and admitting it.
[02:39:53.393 --> 02:39:55.615]  But the military is getting screwed over worse than anybody.
[02:39:55.615 --> 02:40:04.464]  I mean, who would have the nerve to put even young men and women with treatable diseases on Do Not Treat list at the VA?
[02:40:04.464 --> 02:40:08.628]  I mean, they are... Our government is so illegitimate, Gerald.
[02:40:08.628 --> 02:40:09.869]  Where do you see all this going?
[02:40:09.869 --> 02:40:12.572]  I mean, Washington is so blackmailed.
[02:40:12.572 --> 02:40:12.993]  Congress...
[02:40:14.073 --> 02:40:17.635]  You know, wouldn't even stop the FCC grabbing the internet.
[02:40:17.635 --> 02:40:19.516]  They're just, Obama's dissolved the borders.
[02:40:19.516 --> 02:40:21.938]  They're about to sign the Pacific Partnership in secret.
[02:40:21.938 --> 02:40:25.660]  I mean, we are living in just a crazy time.
[02:40:25.660 --> 02:40:27.321]  Where is it all going?
[02:40:27.321 --> 02:40:30.303]  Again, you know, we're looking at a collapse.
[02:40:30.303 --> 02:40:32.464]  And it's not only in the United States.
[02:40:32.464 --> 02:40:34.686]  Look what's going on around the world.
[02:40:34.686 --> 02:40:37.507]  Whether it's the Podemos party in Spain.
[02:40:37.507 --> 02:40:39.869]  Whether it's UKIP in the UK.
[02:40:39.869 --> 02:40:41.470]  The Pence party got, what, 25% of the vote?
[02:40:43.331 --> 02:40:46.912]  You're going to start seeing more and more revolution take place.
[02:40:46.912 --> 02:40:47.912]  The people have had it.
[02:40:47.912 --> 02:40:49.292]  You know the numbers.
[02:40:49.292 --> 02:40:50.672]  What is it?
[02:40:50.672 --> 02:40:56.053]  1% according to OPSFAM is going to control 99% of all the money next year?
[02:40:56.053 --> 02:41:06.515]  But I mean how can the elites then know that there's a class war against the middle class going on by the elite and then try to sick the giant underclass on the middle class and start a race war?
[02:41:06.515 --> 02:41:08.656]  That's not, that dog's not hunting.
[02:41:08.656 --> 02:41:10.336]  Clearly the Democrats and George Soros
[02:41:10.956 --> 02:41:20.633]  Well, they admit it's been released, are spending hundreds of millions total and putting up fake stickers in Austin saying white only to get us all fighting with each other and divide and conquer, Gerald.
[02:41:20.633 --> 02:41:23.739]  I don't see Washington's balkanization plan working.
[02:41:24.923 --> 02:41:29.205]  Well, it's not going to, and it's going to be chaos and more mayhem.
[02:41:29.205 --> 02:41:31.026]  There's absolutely no question about it.
[02:41:31.026 --> 02:41:37.469]  You can have guys like this Paul Tudor Jones, some name like that.
[02:41:37.469 --> 02:41:40.591]  You know, they always have these very important names like Tudor.
[02:41:40.591 --> 02:41:47.194]  And he's coming out, big hedge fund guy, warning about what's going to happen with the middle class dissolving.
[02:41:47.194 --> 02:41:51.957]  And you know what Tudor means, that's British royalty, a British house that fell hundreds of years ago.
[02:41:51.957 --> 02:41:53.658]  But exactly, you look at the elite in our country,
[02:41:54.218 --> 02:41:55.740]  People always obsess over their ethnicity.
[02:41:55.740 --> 02:41:57.843]  A lot of them are connected to British royalty.
[02:41:57.843 --> 02:42:00.467]  And then you see our tabloids worshipping British royalty?
[02:42:00.467 --> 02:42:03.511]  It's like a Twilight Zone episode, Gerald.
[02:42:03.511 --> 02:42:04.272]  It is.
[02:42:04.272 --> 02:42:07.337]  And it's exactly... Look, Alex.
[02:42:07.337 --> 02:42:09.660]  The fish rots from the head down.
[02:42:10.583 --> 02:42:12.304]  It's a truism.
[02:42:12.304 --> 02:42:18.988]  We have become a murderous criminal class run by two mafias.
[02:42:18.988 --> 02:42:22.730]  I should say the Bloods and the Crips, the Democrats and Republicans.
[02:42:22.730 --> 02:42:30.695]  How many more people do they have to murder in the name of freedom and democracy?
[02:42:30.695 --> 02:42:33.417]  And how much more of our money do they have to steal
[02:42:33.957 --> 02:42:35.438]  In the name of too big to fail.
[02:42:35.438 --> 02:42:37.719]  And they've maneuvered us into total bankruptcy.
[02:42:37.719 --> 02:42:40.741]  They're trying to hurt the dollar long term.
[02:42:40.741 --> 02:42:42.662]  What do you think their exit strategy is?
[02:42:42.662 --> 02:42:45.584]  I mean, do they have a method to their madness?
[02:42:45.584 --> 02:42:46.745]  Because I see the London Guardian.
[02:42:46.745 --> 02:42:48.586]  I was reporting on what we've said forever.
[02:42:48.586 --> 02:42:52.788]  They're building secret underground bunkers and castles in the Ozarks.
[02:42:52.788 --> 02:43:03.315]  They're building landing strips in New Zealand in the middle of nowhere and putting in guardhouses with up to 20 armed mercenaries that they give endowments to live with them for life.
[02:43:03.855 --> 02:43:08.279]  I mean, the elite have been really good at screwing everybody over, but now they're going to have to live in armored fortresses.
[02:43:08.279 --> 02:43:12.962]  That's the scariest part for me, is that the elite are digging in, Gerald.
[02:43:12.962 --> 02:43:14.924]  They don't have a clue what to do.
[02:43:14.924 --> 02:43:16.385]  It's out of their control.
[02:43:16.385 --> 02:43:17.586]  It's out of control.
[02:43:17.586 --> 02:43:19.887]  It is spun out of control.
[02:43:19.887 --> 02:43:20.068]  Look.
[02:43:21.027 --> 02:43:40.922]  Tell me one victory in any field, whether it's military, not since World War II, with the exception of course of Grenada and Panama, healthcare, education, environment, everything they touch they turn to failure.
[02:43:40.922 --> 02:43:42.603]  But they've been good at robbing us.
[02:43:42.603 --> 02:43:46.166]  They've been good at robbing us, making us sick and dumb, and destroying the middle class.
[02:43:47.199 --> 02:43:49.720]  They have destroyed the middle class.
[02:43:49.720 --> 02:43:51.260]  It's in front of us.
[02:43:51.260 --> 02:43:53.601]  The numbers, again, don't lie.
[02:43:53.601 --> 02:44:03.023]  You have a gap between the rich and the poor that, what, according to the Pew Research Center, is back to the Gilded Age days and even worse?
[02:44:03.023 --> 02:44:06.084]  The middle class is shot in this country.
[02:44:06.084 --> 02:44:08.304]  We don't even have a day of rest anymore.
[02:44:08.304 --> 02:44:13.886]  Rome, in its most corrupt years, in the 200s and 300s, had a bigger middle class than we have.
[02:44:14.929 --> 02:44:15.890]  Yeah.
[02:44:15.890 --> 02:44:18.512]  So it has collapsed.
[02:44:18.512 --> 02:44:27.340]  And again, going back to this banking issue, I really believe it's there to dissuade people to try to get their money out.
[02:44:27.340 --> 02:44:30.582]  And by the way, that's why I believe in gold.
[02:44:30.582 --> 02:44:33.305]  And again, guns, gold in a getaway.
[02:44:33.305 --> 02:44:34.806]  Even if it goes up or down, it doesn't matter.
[02:44:34.806 --> 02:44:36.327]  At least you got something buried on the back 40.
[02:44:36.327 --> 02:44:39.450]  If everything goes to hell, everybody knows gold and silver has value.
[02:44:40.333 --> 02:44:41.993]  Well, think of it like this.
[02:44:41.993 --> 02:44:45.634]  You're getting negative interest rates over in Europe.
[02:44:45.634 --> 02:44:52.176]  You put your money in the bank, they're gonna charge you to keep it there, 0.25%.
[02:44:52.176 --> 02:44:57.418]  Take out a German bond, a Danish, Austrian, a whole bunch of them.
[02:44:57.418 --> 02:44:58.498]  A five-year bond.
[02:44:59.417 --> 02:45:02.718]  You're going to pay this much for it and you're going to get that much back.
[02:45:02.718 --> 02:45:06.079]  You're going to get less back negative yields.
[02:45:06.079 --> 02:45:19.082]  Why would anybody in their right mind buy a German-Austrian-Danish bond that they know they're going to get paid less at maturity?
[02:45:19.082 --> 02:45:25.624]  Do you think that gold prices are going to be lower than they are now in five years?
[02:45:26.789 --> 02:45:28.830]  No, they can't keep it upside down forever.
[02:45:28.830 --> 02:45:30.230]  It is just wild.
[02:45:30.230 --> 02:45:35.573]  And I was reading different European countries, they make you pay interest to keep your money in a bank.
[02:45:35.573 --> 02:45:38.494]  So it's the opposite inverse of reality.
[02:45:38.494 --> 02:45:44.836]  Exactly, and it goes back to what you were saying about why they're sicking the cops on us.
[02:45:44.836 --> 02:45:53.180]  And by the way, the police in this country have become nothing more than enforcers for the crime bosses.
[02:45:54.093 --> 02:45:57.874]  You mentioned about all those scandals in the banks.
[02:45:57.874 --> 02:46:00.455]  You didn't see one head roll.
[02:46:00.455 --> 02:46:04.677]  And it's the same thing when you go down to the lower levels of the police.
[02:46:04.677 --> 02:46:09.279]  They commit these heinous crimes, nobody's head rolls.
[02:46:09.279 --> 02:46:11.540]  So they take care of each other.
[02:46:11.540 --> 02:46:14.801]  You protect me, I'll take care of you.
[02:46:14.801 --> 02:46:16.481]  And that's what it's become.
[02:46:16.481 --> 02:46:22.964]  They've become enforcers for the Democratic and Republican crime bosses.
[02:46:23.604 --> 02:46:33.650]  Bill, have you seen, there's not one major bank, and I love the language they use, they committed a misdeed.
[02:46:33.650 --> 02:46:35.372]  No, we misspoke.
[02:46:35.372 --> 02:46:36.612]  No, we misled.
[02:46:36.612 --> 02:46:39.154]  How about grand larceny?
[02:46:39.154 --> 02:46:41.175]  Never do you hear that.
[02:46:41.175 --> 02:46:47.920]  And not one, again, not one major conviction under that Eric Holder.
[02:46:49.042 --> 02:47:09.250]  Who was the so-called Attorney General, and still tries to play the role, during the Obama administration, who as the man of change and hope you can believe in, campaigned or lied about how Wall Street was going to pay the price for their criminality.
[02:47:09.250 --> 02:47:15.352]  So the police in this country have become enforcers for the crime bosses.
[02:47:17.179 --> 02:47:18.140]  That's right.
[02:47:18.140 --> 02:47:33.109]  With HSBC and others, they can launder hundreds of billions and then they pay $111 million in the case of Wells Fargo on $300 plus billion and then HSBC was a bigger fine, $1.9, but only because it was swish.
[02:47:33.649 --> 02:47:37.092]  But that's still a small fraction of what they've done.
[02:47:37.092 --> 02:47:51.623]  Meanwhile, old ladies who run tiny little Mexican food restaurants, who are citizens and things, it's in the New York Times, goes every day and deposits the cash, that's their total earnings, and then they put it in the bank and they seize it saying it's criminal because she put it in the bank.
[02:47:52.123 --> 02:47:55.065]  I mean, it's just, it's just rape everyone.
[02:47:55.065 --> 02:47:57.847]  It's just rape the little guy, Gerald.
[02:47:57.847 --> 02:48:00.850]  Again, the fish rots from the head down.
[02:48:00.850 --> 02:48:05.193]  You have immorality being brought to the top by Washington.
[02:48:05.193 --> 02:48:08.295]  And so the people are behaving as their leaders do.
[02:48:08.295 --> 02:48:14.059]  Well, Gerald, I agree with you that the police in many jurisdictions are out of control, but they are, they have indicted, you know, the cop in...
[02:48:15.140 --> 02:48:19.261]  In Albuquerque that, you know, said, I'm going to kill the homeless guy and dead.
[02:48:19.261 --> 02:48:20.482]  I do see a lot of departments.
[02:48:20.482 --> 02:48:22.102]  It's a dichotomy.
[02:48:22.102 --> 02:48:25.824]  It's minor compared to how they bust out shops all the time.
[02:48:25.824 --> 02:48:26.764]  No, no, I get it.
[02:48:26.764 --> 02:48:27.224]  I get it.
[02:48:27.224 --> 02:48:28.625]  Especially, I've been up there in the East.
[02:48:28.625 --> 02:48:29.805]  They're really arrogant.
[02:48:29.805 --> 02:48:33.626]  But expanding on this, all I'm saying is, what's the master plan then?
[02:48:33.626 --> 02:48:36.167]  You've been a big political advisor and consultant.
[02:48:36.167 --> 02:48:39.468]  Why is Soros funding riots against the police?
[02:48:39.468 --> 02:48:40.709]  Are they trying to get a class war going?
[02:48:41.960 --> 02:48:44.921]  Yeah, they have a class war going.
[02:48:44.921 --> 02:48:53.784]  A class war and a racial war keep being initiated by the governments and by these crazy people.
[02:48:53.784 --> 02:48:57.345]  Again, you look at what's going on in this country.
[02:48:57.345 --> 02:49:02.566]  Look how many of these young kids are growing up with no parents, whacked out on drugs.
[02:49:02.566 --> 02:49:04.427]  There's no job futures.
[02:49:04.427 --> 02:49:08.488]  How about all those college students that graduate with what?
[02:49:09.488 --> 02:49:17.213]  40, 50, 60, 70,000, $100,000 worth of debt, and they got a degree in art history?
[02:49:17.213 --> 02:49:18.613]  I mean, come on!
[02:49:18.613 --> 02:49:20.374]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:49:20.374 --> 02:49:28.399]  The arrogance of government does roll downhill, and so I'm guessing, have you had police get in your face or be rude, and what do you say to them when they do?
[02:49:28.399 --> 02:49:29.299]  What's that?
[02:49:29.299 --> 02:49:32.001]  Have you had the police treat you like garbage, and what do you say when they do?
[02:49:33.407 --> 02:49:39.773]  You know, I've had the police treat me in lousy ways, rolling through a stop sign.
[02:49:40.902 --> 02:49:43.683]  Well that's what I'm getting at, Gerald, is the media is
[02:50:03.689 --> 02:50:04.711]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:50:18.453 --> 02:50:24.039]  But again, you know, I mentioned about the local police, then there's the state troopers.
[02:50:24.039 --> 02:50:32.929]  Man, I mean, you know, you can't go out and have a drink, you know, without them, you know, walk the line, do this, bend over, bow down.
[02:50:32.929 --> 02:50:35.251]  No, it's really, it's out of line.
[02:50:35.251 --> 02:50:36.593]  Well, it didn't used to happen in America.
[02:50:36.593 --> 02:50:37.394]  It's definitely not freedom.
[02:50:40.632 --> 02:50:44.354]  Gerald Salente, I want to hit geopolitical issues with you straight ahead.
[02:50:44.354 --> 02:50:46.195]  I want to tell folks about your new Trends Journal.
[02:50:46.195 --> 02:50:50.517]  I've also got one of your journals from years ago where you predicted a bunch of this, and I wanted to read those quotes.
[02:50:50.517 --> 02:50:52.738]  Gerald Salente is our guest.
[02:50:52.738 --> 02:50:56.520]  You'll definitely want to stay with us for the conclusion of the transmission.
[02:50:56.520 --> 02:50:58.320]  TrendsResearch.com.
[02:50:58.320 --> 02:51:00.001]  Go there, get the Trends Research Journal.

[02:51:15.566 --> 02:51:17.007]  These are not on federal lines.
[02:51:17.007 --> 02:51:19.647]  These are lines located on Indian reservations off the grid.
[02:51:19.647 --> 02:51:21.208]  Call 1-605-562-5136.
[02:51:21.208 --> 02:51:24.209]  No smartphones or internet needed.
[02:51:24.209 --> 02:51:26.769]  To hear Alex Jones untapped and off the grid, just call 1-605-562-5136.
[02:51:30.351 --> 02:51:31.351]  Hey, Boomer!
[02:51:31.351 --> 02:51:34.794]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[02:51:34.794 --> 02:51:36.455]  Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[02:51:36.455 --> 02:51:38.397]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[02:51:38.397 --> 02:51:44.261]  Mom says it's because the Berkey filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[02:51:44.261 --> 02:51:45.081]  I know, right?
[02:51:45.081 --> 02:51:46.402]  You love it, too!
[02:51:46.402 --> 02:51:47.824]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[02:51:47.824 --> 02:51:48.864]  Let's go get some!
[02:51:48.864 --> 02:51:50.606]  Get Berkey clean water by calling 877-886-3653.
[02:51:50.606 --> 02:51:50.806]  That's 877-886-3653.
[02:51:50.806 --> 02:51:51.446]  Or visit GoBerkey.com.
[02:51:59.321 --> 02:52:02.143]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:52:02.143 --> 02:52:07.266]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:52:07.266 --> 02:52:15.392]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:52:15.392 --> 02:52:19.914]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:52:19.914 --> 02:52:23.717]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:52:23.877 --> 02:52:29.821]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[02:52:29.821 --> 02:52:32.983]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:52:32.983 --> 02:52:38.367]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[02:53:00.100 --> 02:53:02.381]  Mike Stenerson from Midas Resources.
[02:53:02.381 --> 02:53:05.702]  In no time in history have precious metals been more important.
[02:53:05.702 --> 02:53:08.443]  Certainly not in my 22 years in the industry.
[02:53:08.443 --> 02:53:12.384]  The dollar has lost over 90% of its value in the last 60 years.
[02:53:12.384 --> 02:53:16.145]  No fiat currency has ever survived the government printing presses.
[02:53:16.145 --> 02:53:17.566]  Ours is not immune.
[02:53:17.566 --> 02:53:19.206]  The time is now to be proactive.
[02:53:19.206 --> 02:53:19.786]  1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[02:53:24.548 --> 02:53:27.249]  Anything tied to the dollar is at risk.
[02:53:27.249 --> 02:53:31.770]  CDs, annuities, 401Ks, IRAs, stocks, bonds, you name it.
[02:53:31.770 --> 02:53:32.850]  So decide.
[02:53:32.850 --> 02:53:36.171]  Do you want to leave a legacy of wealth or debt for your family?
[02:53:36.171 --> 02:53:37.471]  The choice is yours.
[02:53:37.471 --> 02:53:38.551]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[02:53:38.551 --> 02:53:39.712]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[02:53:39.712 --> 02:53:40.732]  Be proactive, not reactive.
[02:53:40.732 --> 02:53:40.892]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:53:53.195 --> 02:54:13.142]  I'm the voice inside your head You refuse to hear I'm the face that you have to face Mirror in your stare I'm what's left I'm what's right I'm the enemy
[02:54:35.550 --> 02:54:36.991]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:36.991 --> 02:54:39.214]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:54:39.214 --> 02:54:42.036]  One reason we're seeing the tyranny expand
[02:54:43.098 --> 02:54:45.480]  So fast is that people are waking up.
[02:54:45.480 --> 02:54:47.741]  There's a lot of good news happening every day as well.
[02:54:47.741 --> 02:54:51.264]  Monsanto hit with fine for genetically contaminating wheat supply.
[02:54:51.264 --> 02:54:55.006]  Monsanto chief admits hubris is to blame for public fears over GM.
[02:54:55.006 --> 02:54:56.367]  No, we've read the studies.
[02:54:56.367 --> 02:55:00.430]  Robots to replace half of jobs over next 20 years.
[02:55:00.430 --> 02:55:04.733]  Apple's Wozniak warns that AI is being designed to basically take over.
[02:55:04.733 --> 02:55:08.155]  Now algorithms are deciding whom to hire based on voice.
[02:55:08.155 --> 02:55:12.438]  Why are the elites trying to build a world that isn't based on humans?
[02:55:13.218 --> 02:55:15.480]  I mean, I know they believe they're going to merge with machines and be gods.
[02:55:15.480 --> 02:55:18.884]  It just sounds like more delusional craziness out of the elites.
[02:55:18.884 --> 02:55:21.526]  Where do you, in the long term, see humanity going?
[02:55:21.526 --> 02:55:23.889]  Do you have a good prognosis, Gerald Cilente?
[02:55:24.975 --> 02:55:30.017]  If it keeps going in the direction it is, there's no question about it.
[02:55:30.017 --> 02:55:33.479]  We're dumbing down at great levels.
[02:55:33.479 --> 02:55:35.600]  Artificial intelligence, right?
[02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:43.663]  Artificial intelligence is as great as artificial flavors, or artificial coloring, and artificial food.
[02:55:43.663 --> 02:55:47.965]  And that's where it's going.
[02:55:47.965 --> 02:55:52.967]  Gerald, looking at the entire planet right now,
[02:55:54.252 --> 02:55:57.174]  What do you think the next big hotspot is?
[02:55:57.174 --> 02:56:00.355]  Well, I believe it's going to be the Middle East.
[02:56:00.355 --> 02:56:02.056]  And Ukraine.
[02:56:02.056 --> 02:56:06.779]  You saw Congress came out recently and voted a resolution.
[02:56:06.779 --> 02:56:08.220]  What was it about?
[02:56:08.220 --> 02:56:08.880]  300-something.
[02:56:08.880 --> 02:56:11.602]  Hello?
[02:56:11.602 --> 02:56:14.123]  Yes, Gerald, can you hear us talking?
[02:56:14.123 --> 02:56:14.843]  Yeah, I can hear you.
[02:56:14.843 --> 02:56:15.804]  Can you hear me?
[02:56:15.804 --> 02:56:18.365]  Yes, you just paused and you're saying hello.
[02:56:18.365 --> 02:56:20.386]  Are you hearing any audio come across?
[02:56:20.386 --> 02:56:21.207]  Yeah, I hear you fine.
[02:56:22.119 --> 02:56:27.202]  Okay, you're just pausing when I'm letting you talk, and so I'm just wondering, are you hearing anything?
[02:56:27.202 --> 02:56:28.703]  Yeah, I hear you fine.
[02:56:28.703 --> 02:56:33.566]  The hotspots, Alex, I believe are going to be Ukraine and the Middle East.
[02:56:33.566 --> 02:56:44.073]  You just saw a resolution passed in Congress to arm Ukraine, Western Ukraine, Kyiv, with lethal weapons.
[02:56:44.073 --> 02:56:44.793]  Great!
[02:56:44.793 --> 02:56:48.856]  That'll make things really nice.
[02:56:48.856 --> 02:56:49.356]  Well, Gerald,
[02:56:51.061 --> 02:56:54.110]  What can we do from your historical research to try to stop this?
[02:56:56.069 --> 02:56:58.409]  We need a new third party as I see it.
[02:56:58.409 --> 02:57:00.510]  It just can't go on like this.
[02:57:00.510 --> 02:57:03.130]  I don't care who's going to lead either party.
[02:57:03.130 --> 02:57:04.510]  They're too corrupt.
[02:57:04.510 --> 02:57:07.171]  They're too in bed with the special interests.
[02:57:07.171 --> 02:57:11.512]  Let's stop calling it the House of Representatives.
[02:57:11.512 --> 02:57:16.172]  The only ones they represent are the people that give them money.
[02:57:16.172 --> 02:57:25.334]  And the people that give them the most money are the drug companies, the communications industry, the military, industrial, and cyber-industrial complex.
[02:57:26.032 --> 02:57:27.452]  What about voting with our dollars?
[02:57:27.452 --> 02:57:31.834]  You always talk about creating local communities, farmers markets, supporting local shops.
[02:57:31.834 --> 02:57:40.837]  Isn't the model of us wrecking the globalist Monsanto and McDonald's, profits plunging, isn't voting with our dollars really the best revolutionary thing we've got right now?
[02:57:41.826 --> 02:57:47.351]  Right now it is, but it's at a smaller level, and it's going to take a lot of time.
[02:57:47.351 --> 02:57:49.853]  It has to start from the community.
[02:57:49.853 --> 02:57:56.119]  But Alex, we're going into the 2016 elections, and it's going to be one party or another.
[02:57:56.119 --> 02:58:02.384]  And as you're looking at it now, it's not even a two-party system, it's a two-family system.
[02:58:02.384 --> 02:58:07.128]  I mean, do you know how many times I'm sick of hearing about Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton?
[02:58:07.128 --> 02:58:07.629]  What a joke!
[02:58:08.735 --> 02:58:09.556]  What a joke!
[02:58:09.556 --> 02:58:15.760]  That shows how out of touch the political class is to think that we would support either one of those people.
[02:58:15.760 --> 02:58:16.780]  Exactly!
[02:58:16.780 --> 02:58:18.922]  And they're being shoved down our throat!
[02:58:20.051 --> 02:58:27.077]  Could you look at the low, look at the dignity of the White House, how low it has sunk.
[02:58:27.077 --> 02:58:36.005]  Could you imagine, could you imagine Dwight D. Eisenhower yucking it up with his Kimmel character or another one?
[02:58:36.005 --> 02:58:37.146]  It's all a complete joke.
[02:58:37.146 --> 02:58:39.689]  All they give us is hype instead of a prosperity.
[02:58:39.689 --> 02:58:44.233]  We're gonna end the main transmission but do some overdrive with Gerald Cilente and fullworks.com forward slash show.
[02:58:44.233 --> 02:58:44.993]  God bless you all.
[02:58:44.993 --> 02:58:45.794]  Great job, crew.
[02:58:50.393 --> 02:58:51.314]  Alex Jones here.
[02:58:51.314 --> 02:59:00.540]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[02:59:00.540 --> 02:59:05.784]  So many other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients, synthetic additives, and even GMOs.
[02:59:06.104 --> 02:59:09.827]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[02:59:09.827 --> 02:59:19.395]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts to supercharge and prepare your body for what experts admit is the most dangerous season of the year.
[02:59:19.395 --> 02:59:30.804]  We have rejected hundreds of other formulations in our quest to bring you what is simply the most powerful and comprehensive proprietary formula that we have ever created in the realm of herbal immunity.
[02:59:30.804 --> 02:59:35.588]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts
[02:59:35.788 --> 02:59:37.549]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:01.311 --> 03:00:10.256]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:00:10.256 --> 03:00:17.940]  I'm going to be in California at Cal Jam, and I think almost all the tickets are sold out, but you can still sign up to watch on streams.
[03:00:19.060 --> 03:00:33.331]  At CalJam.com, there's links on InfoWars.com, but I'd like to just hear on air when David Knight's sitting in doing a fabulous job Friday, Sunday, or Monday, I'll be calling in as well and probably doing some Skype reports, so I'll be on the show some as well, at least Sunday and Monday.
[03:00:33.331 --> 03:00:42.138]  But I'd like to invite Gerald on about trends and his new trends research, if he can do it Friday or Monday, but we'll see.
[03:00:42.138 --> 03:00:43.579]  Just so much to talk about with Gerald Celente.
[03:00:43.579 --> 03:00:47.302]  We should also have him back on, just open the phones up, so you can call in with your wildcard points.
[03:00:48.243 --> 03:00:54.168]  Gerald, I've been asking most of the questions myself, but the criminality is accelerating.
[03:00:54.168 --> 03:00:58.151]  I think the establishment is just desperate and doesn't know what to do.
[03:00:58.151 --> 03:01:12.702]  I don't see it working, but I see Sitcom and others declaring war on Russia this week, saying we're now in a war with Russia and sending in brigades of armor and announcing that they're in cyber war with them.
[03:01:12.702 --> 03:01:16.765]  Even during the Cold War and in the Cuban Missile Crisis, there wasn't rhetoric like this.
[03:01:17.806 --> 03:01:28.335]  I mean, I really see behavior out of elites that shows that they really are, I mean, used to, we at least had generals and presidents that have been in heavy combat, like JFK or Dwight D. Eisenhower.
[03:01:28.335 --> 03:01:33.039]  They weren't perfect, but I mean, they understood that they weren't bulletproof.
[03:01:33.039 --> 03:01:38.063]  I just think that the white shoe boys you talk about are so insulated, they think they're, you know what, doesn't stink.
[03:01:38.063 --> 03:01:42.707]  And I see historically the type of chutzpah that destroys civilizations.
[03:01:42.707 --> 03:01:44.669]  I mean, I don't know if we're going to make it because of these people, Gerald.
[03:01:45.930 --> 03:01:47.451]  Well, again, that's what I was saying.
[03:01:47.451 --> 03:01:48.552]  You know, we need a new way.
[03:01:48.552 --> 03:01:49.834]  Well, look at the people.
[03:01:49.834 --> 03:01:51.455]  Who are we talking about?
[03:01:51.455 --> 03:01:53.757]  Let's put faces and names together.
[03:01:53.757 --> 03:01:55.779]  Lloyd Blankfein.
[03:01:55.779 --> 03:01:59.102]  How about Blankface?
[03:01:59.102 --> 03:02:00.624]  Pelosi.
[03:02:00.624 --> 03:02:02.766]  Not-so-Feinstein.
[03:02:02.766 --> 03:02:03.687]  McConnell.
[03:02:04.696 --> 03:02:06.117]  Reed?
[03:02:06.117 --> 03:02:08.238]  Little Lindsey Graham?
[03:02:08.238 --> 03:02:12.861]  How can any self-respecting person look up to these people?
[03:02:12.861 --> 03:02:14.442]  Obama?
[03:02:14.442 --> 03:02:15.203]  One lie!
[03:02:15.203 --> 03:02:16.243]  Hey!
[03:02:16.243 --> 03:02:17.144]  Great job!
[03:02:17.144 --> 03:02:28.471]  Hey, remember that speech you gave about our strategic alliances with Yemen and how our security and intelligence are doing so great?
[03:02:28.471 --> 03:02:29.412]  Yeah!
[03:02:29.412 --> 03:02:31.513]  Happy days in Yemen!
[03:02:31.513 --> 03:02:32.894]  Oh, you forget this one?
[03:02:33.274 --> 03:02:37.936]  We're gonna be out of there by an Afghanistan before you know it.
[03:02:37.936 --> 03:02:38.556]  Oh!
[03:02:38.556 --> 03:02:40.397]  You're changing the tune.
[03:02:40.397 --> 03:02:42.318]  Look at the people!
[03:02:42.318 --> 03:02:44.639]  You want some arrogance?
[03:02:44.639 --> 03:02:46.480]  Hey, how about Hillary Clinton?
[03:02:47.333 --> 03:02:49.594]  Hey, bring back Dick Cheney!
[03:02:49.594 --> 03:02:51.675]  Let's hear a liar again!
[03:02:51.675 --> 03:02:53.536]  Put him out on the media!
[03:02:53.536 --> 03:02:57.098]  Look at this guy, this General Scales!
[03:02:57.098 --> 03:03:13.166]  The erotic fish scales that are saying on Fox that we need to kill some more Russians over there in Ukraine and send them over in body bags so that Putin will get the message.
[03:03:13.166 --> 03:03:15.647]  Why put a nut like this on television?
[03:03:15.647 --> 03:03:16.928]  No president ever talked like that.
[03:03:17.248 --> 03:03:20.091]  That is literal thug gangster talk.
[03:03:20.091 --> 03:03:20.592]  That's what I mean.
[03:03:20.592 --> 03:03:22.134]  These people are crazy.
[03:03:22.134 --> 03:03:23.535]  They're crazy!
[03:03:23.535 --> 03:03:26.598]  And no one wants to call them what they are.
[03:03:26.598 --> 03:03:31.384]  Instead they call them Congressman, Senator, and President.
[03:03:32.927 --> 03:03:34.248]  Well, I mean, no one.
[03:03:34.248 --> 03:03:37.450]  Imagine Ronald Reagan saying, we need to send a bunch of dead Russians over there.
[03:03:37.450 --> 03:03:38.350]  That'll teach them.
[03:03:38.350 --> 03:03:40.011]  That would start a nuclear war.
[03:03:40.011 --> 03:03:43.654]  And the Russians aren't perfect, but I mean, they are freaking out, getting ready for war.
[03:03:43.654 --> 03:03:44.875]  They're scared.
[03:03:44.875 --> 03:03:46.576]  Putin stays in a bunker most of the time.
[03:03:46.576 --> 03:03:48.317]  I mean, this is dangerous, folks.
[03:03:49.705 --> 03:03:57.908]  Everyone that has followed the Ukraine crisis from the beginning, those who started it.
[03:03:57.908 --> 03:04:02.129]  Victoria Nuland, the Assistant Secretary of State.
[03:04:02.129 --> 03:04:03.609]  But she's a feminist, so it's okay.
[03:04:03.609 --> 03:04:04.890]  If she destroys the planet, it's okay.
[03:04:05.430 --> 03:04:06.671]  That's different, of course.
[03:04:06.671 --> 03:04:08.951]  If only the women were in charge.
[03:04:08.951 --> 03:04:15.894]  Yeah, like that Samantha Powers and Susan Rice and Hillary Clinton that started the Libyan War.
[03:04:15.894 --> 03:04:17.734]  Oh yeah, peace on Earth.
[03:04:17.734 --> 03:04:20.775]  Oh, and what's her name's over there, Samantha Powers?
[03:04:20.775 --> 03:04:27.318]  She's over there in Brussels two weeks ago saying that NATO's not putting enough money into defense.
[03:04:28.078 --> 03:04:44.989]  So when you look who started the Ukraine war, whether you like Yanukovych or not, the United States engineered the overthrow of a democratically elected government and installed a puppet Poroshenko.
[03:04:44.989 --> 03:04:47.071]  You look at the, look what's going on.
[03:04:47.071 --> 03:04:49.332]  We've totally lost some moral high ground.
[03:04:49.332 --> 03:04:50.613]  We've got to remove the criminals.
