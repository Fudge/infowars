[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  Waging War on Corruption.
[00:06.000 --> 00:15.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:15.000 --> 00:21.000]  Well, here we are.
[00:21.000 --> 00:27.000]  It's the last live Sunday broadcast of 2018.
[00:27.000 --> 00:32.000]  December 30th, 2018.
[00:32.000 --> 00:41.000]  This incredible year is about to give up the ghost and plunge into history.
[00:41.000 --> 00:47.000]  And then, 2019 looms.
[00:47.000 --> 00:54.000]  Not on the horizon, but one inch from our face.
[00:54.000 --> 00:55.000]  What does it hold?
[00:55.000 --> 00:56.000]  What were the biggest stories?
[00:56.000 --> 01:03.000]  What was most important in this year and what is coming in the next year?
[01:03.000 --> 01:13.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, hated by the vampire establishment for one reason.
[01:13.000 --> 01:21.000]  I love life, and I love competition, and I aim to stop them with your help.
[01:21.000 --> 01:24.000]  And I'm not afraid of them.
[01:24.000 --> 01:32.000]  I've already calculated every possible permutation, a persecution, and already accepted it.
[01:32.000 --> 01:40.000]  Though I do feel guilty for doing even that.
[01:40.000 --> 01:52.000]  David Knight, who is such a hardworking, smart, informed jewel of a person, had a pretty serious heart attack last night.
[01:52.000 --> 02:00.000]  And it's rough going to the hospital right now, here in Austin, Texas.
[02:00.000 --> 02:08.000]  I met with him on Thursday, and he was really concerned about the country, and he really took all of it on.
[02:08.000 --> 02:16.000]  And I told him, I said, you need to take some time off, buddy.
[02:16.000 --> 02:18.000]  His skin was ash white.
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  He's lost a lot of weight.
[02:20.000 --> 02:26.000]  He gets ready for four or five hours every day for a show, and studies for three or four hours after that.
[02:26.000 --> 02:29.000]  There's nothing I've researched he doesn't already know about.
[02:29.000 --> 02:36.000]  I mean, let me tell you, this guy's like a monk, and I said, you need to take off some.
[02:36.000 --> 02:38.000]  He got too close to this.
[02:38.000 --> 02:40.000]  He stared at the abyss too long.
[02:40.000 --> 02:47.000]  Well, it basically, what that's going to do me to tell us, turns out he's had heart blockages for a while, probably had a heart attack before, didn't even know about it.
[02:47.000 --> 02:51.000]  And he's got some big serious procedures tomorrow morning to go under.
[02:51.000 --> 02:55.000]  And he definitely needs your prayers.
[02:55.000 --> 03:01.000]  And all the attacks we go through, the fake lawsuits, the boycotts, the lies.
[03:01.000 --> 03:02.000]  That's from the globalist.
[03:02.000 --> 03:03.000]  I can deal with that.
[03:03.000 --> 03:12.000]  But, you know, having somebody like David who does such a great job and reaches millions of people a week fighting for his life.
[03:12.000 --> 03:13.000]  That's what he's doing right now.
[03:13.000 --> 03:14.000]  He's fighting for his life.
[03:14.000 --> 03:20.000]  Just a few miles from where I said, it gets to me.
[03:20.000 --> 03:25.000]  It's a shadow of a portend for a comfort for everybody.
[03:25.000 --> 03:32.000]  It's that feeling where you're not afraid of death anymore, but you're afraid of your body giving out so you're not there for my children.
[03:32.000 --> 03:38.000]  So I tell you, when I look at my son and my three daughters, I just think about how can I be better?
[03:38.000 --> 03:40.000]  How can I exercise more?
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.000]  How can I be a better steward of my health?
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.000]  Because you just want to live longer for them, not for yourself.
[03:49.000 --> 03:52.000]  And David's got a big family he takes care of.
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.000]  He's a great guy.
[03:54.000 --> 03:58.000]  And again, I asked the family, I said, you want me to talk about this?
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  And they said, yeah, do whatever you think you need.
[04:00.000 --> 04:01.000]  Just please ask for prayers.
[04:01.000 --> 04:05.000]  But I know the specifics of the prognosis.
[04:05.000 --> 04:12.000]  And I called a heart surgeon, I know, to get what the particular surgeries mean.
[04:12.000 --> 04:16.000]  And it's not, no heart attack is not serious.
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.000]  But David definitely needs your prayers.
[04:19.000 --> 04:25.000]  He definitely needs your prayers because they're going to cauterize his heart tomorrow morning.
[04:25.000 --> 04:26.000]  It means burn.
[04:26.000 --> 04:28.000]  And they're going to do some other things to it.
[04:28.000 --> 04:31.000]  I'm not going to get into the whole deal of the families watching and listening.
[04:31.000 --> 04:35.000]  But David's a tough guy.
[04:35.000 --> 04:42.000]  It looks like he's been up here working for years with his heart shot.
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  Reminds me of somebody else I know.
[04:44.000 --> 04:47.000]  Not me, but somebody close to me.
[04:47.000 --> 04:49.000]  That's the thing about old fashioned men.
[04:49.000 --> 04:50.000]  They don't tell you what's happening to them.
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  It's like Michael Savage talks about his dad for years.
[04:52.000 --> 04:55.000]  Still working on that hardware store with those heart problems.
[04:55.000 --> 04:56.000]  He finally died.
[04:56.000 --> 05:00.000]  Let's pray for David Knight so he can come back better and stronger.
[05:00.000 --> 05:06.000]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember, this life is a test.
[05:06.000 --> 05:09.000]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action,
[05:09.000 --> 05:13.000]  the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity coming back from the dead
[05:13.000 --> 05:18.000]  and recognizing it's being persecuted, that's all because you are the core.
[05:18.000 --> 05:20.000]  Listening to M4 Wars around the world.
[05:20.000 --> 05:28.000]  The eyes and ears of liberty that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming.
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  Everybody knows, who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians,
[05:32.000 --> 05:37.000]  who tend to be immune to the globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it.
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[05:39.000 --> 05:42.000]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying.
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.000]  2018 has been insane.
[05:44.000 --> 05:51.000]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[05:51.000 --> 05:55.000]  Not behind us, but right beside us and at the heart of everything resisting these globalists.
[05:55.000 --> 06:00.000]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together and I salute you.
[06:07.000 --> 06:17.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the frontlines of the M4 War.
[06:17.000 --> 06:26.000]  Well, there's only about a day and a half left in the epic, and I mean epic year of 2018.
[06:26.000 --> 06:30.000]  A lot of folks used to overuse the term epic, but we're living in epic times.
[06:30.000 --> 06:31.000]  Interesting times.
[06:31.000 --> 06:40.000]  My good buddy, one of the smartest people I know, when it comes to giant breadth of knowledge and engineer, a patriot,
[06:40.000 --> 06:46.000]  David Knight is having a rough time in the hospital, had a big heart attack last night.
[06:46.000 --> 06:52.000]  He's going to have some big heart surgeries tomorrow, multiple procedures, and so he needs your prayers.
[06:52.000 --> 07:00.000]  And here's one of the most powerful intros he ever put together, dealing with eugenics, dealing with dehumanization,
[07:00.000 --> 07:04.000]  dealing with the devaluation of life, something he has fought so hard against.
[07:04.000 --> 07:10.000]  So on this Sunday night, the 30th day of December 2018, while David Knight's fighting for his life,
[07:10.000 --> 07:13.000]  our great host of the David Knight Show, Weekday Mornings.
[07:13.000 --> 07:16.000]  I thought I'd go ahead and play this piece here it is.
[07:22.000 --> 07:27.000]  Aborted babies incinerated to eat UK hospitals.
[07:27.000 --> 07:32.000]  Silent green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of people.
[07:32.000 --> 07:38.000]  But now children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals in the UK.
[07:38.000 --> 07:43.000]  They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[07:43.000 --> 07:48.000]  It is the secret of Silent Green.
[07:48.000 --> 07:53.000]  A powdered flesh from dead babies. Some people believe they can cure disease.
[07:53.000 --> 07:58.000]  Because of its enormous popularity, Silent Green is in short supply.
[07:58.000 --> 08:01.000]  Remember, Tuesday is Silent Green Day.
[08:01.000 --> 08:07.000]  The supply of Silent Green has been exhausted. You must evacuate the area.
[08:07.000 --> 08:09.000]  Silent Green!
[08:09.000 --> 08:14.000]  They said in the court rule that the shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Builder Bird Group company,
[08:14.000 --> 08:21.000]  are not allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for and the flavoring, but we already know.
[08:21.000 --> 08:23.000]  So enjoy the flavor.
[08:23.000 --> 08:28.000]  We're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death panels and sales taxes.
[08:28.000 --> 08:33.000]  I'm consistently pro-death. I'm for assisted suicide. I'm for regular suicide.
[08:33.000 --> 08:35.000]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[08:35.000 --> 08:39.000]  Spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient,
[08:39.000 --> 08:46.000]  would it be better not to lay off those ten teachers and to make that trade-up in medical costs?
[08:46.000 --> 08:50.000]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[08:50.000 --> 08:57.000]  They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[08:57.000 --> 09:07.000]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[09:07.000 --> 09:12.000]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens.
[09:12.000 --> 09:14.000]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[09:14.000 --> 09:20.000]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison guards,
[09:20.000 --> 09:24.000]  on the quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[09:24.000 --> 09:27.000]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[09:27.000 --> 09:32.000]  The scoops are on their way. The scoops are on their way.
[09:32.000 --> 09:35.000]  I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[09:35.000 --> 09:42.000]  You will find out why Soylent Green means life. You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[09:42.000 --> 09:44.000]  We've got to stop them. Come on.
[09:44.000 --> 09:48.000]  That is the secret of Soylent Green.
[09:48.000 --> 09:54.000]  Soylent Green is people.
[09:54.000 --> 09:57.000]  They may just think they'll be pretty, just like cattle.
[09:57.000 --> 10:02.000]  For food, you've got to tell them.
[10:02.000 --> 10:06.000]  So there's an important piece with David Knight featured in it.
[10:06.000 --> 10:08.000]  Again, David, it's a great part of the M4's operation.
[10:08.000 --> 10:11.000]  I've been planning to push to go live at least 20 hours a day here.
[10:11.000 --> 10:15.000]  We've got David Knight, we've got Owen Troyer, we've got Roger Stone and others.
[10:15.000 --> 10:20.000]  We obviously want David to pull through all of this.
[10:20.000 --> 10:24.000]  He's a serious heart surgery. He's got to have tomorrow.
[10:24.000 --> 10:26.000]  So please pray for him.
[10:26.000 --> 10:30.000]  They took down his M4's Twitter accounts and they banned him on Google and Facebook.
[10:30.000 --> 10:35.000]  He had over 9 million subscribers to his radio and TV show on iTunes.
[10:35.000 --> 10:40.000]  Just because he was affiliated with me, the devil, they deleted all those as well.
[10:40.000 --> 10:45.000]  He's effective and he tells the truth and that's all part of this amazing censorship.
[10:45.000 --> 10:53.000]  He still has his personal account at Libertarian, where you can follow him at Twitter
[10:53.000 --> 10:55.000]  and hopefully support the family.
[10:55.000 --> 10:59.000]  Okay, let me tell you what's coming up here.
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.000]  Some of this I covered on Friday, but I want to recap.
[11:02.000 --> 11:09.000]  A lot of this is new, but it's just illustrative of the Trump derangement syndrome
[11:09.000 --> 11:12.000]  that is taking place.
[11:12.000 --> 11:15.000]  There was a big video that we posted on Saturday.
[11:15.000 --> 11:20.000]  DrudgeReport.com had it as its top story, still up there.
[11:20.000 --> 11:27.000]  Of a man going into a vape shop, which isn't perfect for your health,
[11:27.000 --> 11:31.000]  but a lot of studies better for you than combustion with cigarettes.
[11:31.000 --> 11:35.000]  He's trying to get his wife some strawberry flavored nicotine.
[11:35.000 --> 11:37.000]  And he's wearing a Trump hat.
[11:37.000 --> 11:46.000]  Watch, unhinged leftist has mental breakdown, refuses service to Trump's supporter in vape shop.
[11:46.000 --> 11:53.000]  And so he starts videotaping the guy calling him the N-word, hitting him, attacking him,
[11:53.000 --> 11:58.000]  because the white guy is virtually saving only some black guy who's in there trying to buy.
[11:58.000 --> 12:01.000]  And the black guy's like, hey dude, I get it, you've done nothing wrong, we're in a Trump hat.
[12:01.000 --> 12:07.000]  But the leftist white person wants to act like this knight in shining armor, this savior.
[12:07.000 --> 12:11.000]  That's coming up next segment and next segment.
[12:11.000 --> 12:17.000]  Another video of like a 6-3 transgendered man, bigger shoulders than I've got.
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.000]  I'm a pretty big guy.
[12:21.000 --> 12:27.000]  This guy's built like a, you know what, brick house, an SH, you know what, house.
[12:27.000 --> 12:31.000]  And he walks in there with a bunch of liberal trendies at a game stop.
[12:31.000 --> 12:34.000]  And the dudes wearing, you know, a pink shirt or whatever.
[12:34.000 --> 12:38.000]  Okay, but you look like a NFL linebacker.
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.000]  They're like, hey dude, sure, what do you want?
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  Whoa, I'm a woman.
[12:42.000 --> 12:46.000]  I'm a video transgender goes nuts and store for being misgendered.
[12:46.000 --> 12:51.000]  This is the religion of oppression.
[12:51.000 --> 12:58.000]  The left oppresses the left the most because it's all about just bullying people.
[12:58.000 --> 13:01.000]  So that's coming up.
[13:01.000 --> 13:08.000]  Then Roger Stone is going to be popping in to respond to the latest Mueller garbage.
[13:08.000 --> 13:11.000]  We've got Rudolf Silliani saying put up or shut up.
[13:11.000 --> 13:18.000]  You know, you've got Michael Moore of the clips coming up saying, I can't wait to see the Trump family in orange jumpsuits and what's it for?
[13:18.000 --> 13:24.000]  Nothing to do with Russia. Michael Cohen, one of Trump's lawyers had some corrupt dealings.
[13:24.000 --> 13:36.000]  He's plugged guilty to with a taxi company that Trump has zero, not a zip to it.
[13:36.000 --> 13:39.000]  That's coming up.
[13:39.000 --> 13:49.000]  And we're going to look at every angle of this, but I also want to tell you about Kevin Spacey.
[13:49.000 --> 13:56.000]  Now, a lot of people have said Alex, it's been almost a week since this grace top Hollywood actor.
[13:56.000 --> 13:59.000]  I'm not going to lie to you. I think he's a good actor.
[13:59.000 --> 14:05.000]  A great actor who I do not endorse politically who I've exposed who I don't like.
[14:05.000 --> 14:09.000]  He's saying he's a good actor. He's playing himself a psychotic.
[14:09.000 --> 14:16.000]  He put out this video almost a week ago and people wanted me to comment, but I don't just comment.
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.000]  I watched it.
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.000]  Like what last weekend or whatever when it came out.
[14:23.000 --> 14:31.000]  And then I watched the internet speculate, but then I began to connect the dots of the research started done and there's no doubt.
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.000]  That is right.
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  The, the knowledge that's right.
[14:37.000 --> 14:42.000]  He definitely is threatening the pedophile establishment, the Clintons and the British aristocracy.
[14:42.000 --> 14:48.000]  It's heavily involved in pedophilia and he signaled it all in the video.
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.000]  I mean, I already know Kevin Spacey is connected to known pedophiles.
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  I already know he flies around on Jeffrey Epstein's planes.
[14:54.000 --> 15:03.000]  I already know that there's hundreds of reports of him groping people down to age 15, which is terrible.
[15:03.000 --> 15:10.000]  It's Donna's baddest raping little kids or murdering them, but you know, he's a bad dude.
[15:10.000 --> 15:21.000]  But now that this Nantucket thing's coming out where he's with some guy says he's 23 and he's buying the guy drinks and then he lets Spacey grab his crotch and then never says no.
[15:21.000 --> 15:24.000]  And that's the big case. That doesn't sound like rape to me.
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  And I'm not defending Kevin Spacey.
[15:26.000 --> 15:34.000]  I think the guy's a pervert, a pedophile, the evidence points towards it on Jeffrey Epstein's plane with the Clintons.
[15:34.000 --> 15:40.000]  But the point is he is now openly threatening.
[15:40.000 --> 15:47.000]  There's no doubt in this video that he is saying I'm about to turn States evidence if you don't drop these charges against me.
[15:47.000 --> 15:55.000]  So this is a big problem for Jeffrey Epstein, a big problem for Steve Bannon that works with Epstein, and a big problem with the Clintons.
[15:55.000 --> 16:21.000]  So stay with us. That's all coming up tonight.
[16:25.000 --> 16:28.000]  And I want you to have storeable food so it's a total win-win.

[19:19.000 --> 19:25.000]  And Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[19:25.000 --> 19:33.000]  There's only two groups in the U.S. Info Wars and Matt Drudge of drudgereport.com that are truly independent.
[19:33.000 --> 19:37.000]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world. It really is amazing.
[19:37.000 --> 19:44.000]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[19:44.000 --> 19:49.000]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will of Info Wars.
[19:49.000 --> 19:54.000]  So please spread the links infowarstore.com, newswarstore.com, christenpana.com.
[19:54.000 --> 20:21.000]  Because if you don't spread the articles in the videos, no one else will. We're all in each other's hands. God bless you all and thank you.
[20:21.000 --> 20:33.000]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[20:33.000 --> 20:43.000]  So on this December 30th, 2018 Sunday transmission, I'm going to say something extremely profound.
[20:43.000 --> 20:51.000]  And again, I'm not saying that to sound powerful. I'm saying that to get your attention because I respect you and I need your help.
[20:51.000 --> 21:02.000]  No matter what color you are, where you came from or what God you worship, they want us shut down because we've got their number.
[21:02.000 --> 21:19.000]  And I'm about to cover some issues and some reports that illustrate everything as a society, everything as a culture we're facing.
[21:19.000 --> 21:32.000]  Now, sometimes we see stories that illustrate everything we're dealing with and that really show us what we're up against.
[21:32.000 --> 21:43.000]  And then it's crazy to see how the news and the culture takes each new story as if it's its own little thing disconnected from everything else.
[21:43.000 --> 21:53.000]  If you're police officers, say in Austin, Texas, we've had an epidemic of deaths from heroin the last few years, flooding the whole U.S.
[21:53.000 --> 22:03.000]  And you start seeing a bunch of deaths from heroin. You know somebody's bringing in a bunch of heroin and that it's very, very strong and that they're so criminal.
[22:03.000 --> 22:12.000]  They're not even telling people how strong it is and to watch out.
[22:12.000 --> 22:16.000]  Just like the drug companies put out the very same stuff, but it's synthetic.
[22:16.000 --> 22:23.000]  The FDA last week approved a drug 100 times stronger than heroin.
[22:23.000 --> 22:27.000]  This is madness. People say, well, what are you getting at?
[22:27.000 --> 22:32.000]  I'm getting at more and more people in corporate America or in government's period just don't care.
[22:32.000 --> 22:43.000]  There's a mass craziness going on. And then those of us that complain, we're the bad guys.
[22:43.000 --> 22:50.000]  No, I believe in warning people.
[22:50.000 --> 22:53.000]  I believe caring about people builds a better civilization.
[22:53.000 --> 23:03.000]  So I want to get into transgender woman threatens to take it outside when GameStop employee uses the word sir.
[23:03.000 --> 23:06.000]  Because it's a big old guy and a lot of guys wear pink shirts.
[23:06.000 --> 23:11.000]  You're looking at a guy with huge shoulders, bigger than mine, six foot three, six foot four.
[23:11.000 --> 23:16.000]  Looks like a dude to me. Walks like a lady though.
[23:16.000 --> 23:20.000]  Dude don't look like a lady. Dude looks like a fruitcake.
[23:20.000 --> 23:24.000]  And then how does that tie together with Kevin Spacey?
[23:24.000 --> 23:27.000]  How's that tie together with the lead express?
[23:27.000 --> 23:38.000]  How's that tie together with Franklin Graham Facebook ban was personal attack towards me.
[23:38.000 --> 23:47.000]  So we're going to be looking at all of that coming up here.
[23:47.000 --> 23:52.000]  But the first thing I want to get to is heavily beat for TV and radio listeners.
[23:52.000 --> 23:56.000]  The raw videos on info wars.com and news wars.com.
[23:56.000 --> 23:58.000]  The most censored sites on the planet.
[23:58.000 --> 24:02.000]  It's easy to find its right dead smack middle of drudge report.com.
[24:02.000 --> 24:04.000]  The largest site on the planet.
[24:04.000 --> 24:09.000]  The largest site on the planet, the most censored site on the planet.
[24:09.000 --> 24:12.000]  And this gentleman walks in.
[24:12.000 --> 24:17.000]  Turns out he's a cell phone repaired tower engineer. He's wearing his Trump hat, Trump shirt.
[24:17.000 --> 24:21.000]  He's very polite. The guy's blowing up at him, hitting him, slapping him saying get out.
[24:21.000 --> 24:31.000]  Virtue signaling.
[24:31.000 --> 24:34.000]  Doing all of this.
[24:34.000 --> 24:40.000]  And it just shows the insane craziness of the culture.
[24:40.000 --> 24:46.000]  Where the controlled corporate left thinks they can do anything or say anything they want to do.
[24:46.000 --> 24:55.000]  And then it's okay because you're a Trump supporter and they're trying to intimidate that speech.
[24:55.000 --> 24:59.000]  So let's go ahead and go to this video in this audio.
[24:59.000 --> 25:06.000]  This happened in Atlanta two days ago. Here it is.
[25:06.000 --> 25:12.000]  So here we are in exhale of it with city and tug of Georgia and I've just been asked to leave the store.
[25:12.000 --> 25:19.000]  He greeted me. That was nice. I did find the item that I wanted and the next thing he said was that he'd like to leave.
[25:19.000 --> 25:23.000]  If you do not stop recording in my store, I'm going to call the police and ask you to leave now.
[25:23.000 --> 25:26.000]  Please call the, that would be awesome. That'd be awesome.
[25:26.000 --> 25:31.000]  We can call Fox five and all sorts of stuff. I'd like to, I would like to purchase something here.
[25:31.000 --> 25:35.000]  Please do call your boss because I will be calling corporate.
[25:35.000 --> 25:40.000]  I am looking forward to releasing this video because I just want to purchase something.
[25:40.000 --> 25:55.000]  I'm not a racist.
[25:55.000 --> 25:58.000]  All right, pause for a minute.
[25:58.000 --> 26:04.000]  If you're a radio listener, you're hearing that for two of you, you see that there's a black guy standing there.
[26:04.000 --> 26:07.000]  Waving his arms when we're like, what?
[26:07.000 --> 26:19.000]  A Trump supporter isn't racist, but the white clerk is so triggered that he can show off to a black guy that he's going to hop around like he's a hip hop artist
[26:19.000 --> 26:29.000]  and do weird cultural appropriation as if black people all act like a hip hop artist jumping around on stage and go, man, screw you, bitch, you're a racist, blah, blah, blah.
[26:29.000 --> 26:36.000]  I mean, this is pathetic, but that's who these people are.
[26:36.000 --> 26:43.000]  I haven't been in a whole foods in months since I protested Jeff Bezos taking it over, but my wife wanted to pick up some particular whole foods.
[26:43.000 --> 26:53.000]  So I went with her yesterday and I had multiple people come up to me and shake my hand, but I had a couple of them come up and make bizarre statements that didn't make sense.
[26:53.000 --> 26:58.000]  But anyways, I'm sorry. Let's go ahead and go back to the video. Here it is.
[26:58.000 --> 27:11.000]  I don't have a problem with you, sir whatsoever. I don't.
[27:11.000 --> 27:17.000]  I just want good health care for my kids. I don't have a problem with the color of your skin or yours.
[27:17.000 --> 27:20.000]  I'd like to purchase some of this naked vape juice, though.
[27:20.000 --> 27:28.000]  If that would be all right. Here's where we're at.
[27:28.000 --> 27:35.000]  Where's the store? I don't give a fuck. Get out.
[27:35.000 --> 27:40.000]  Dude, go ahead. Take another swing at it. Make contact with me one more time. I'm going to make a deal with you.
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.000]  I want to purchase that vape juice. If you sell it to me.
[27:44.000 --> 27:50.000]  If you sell it to me, I won't call the police.
[27:50.000 --> 27:58.000]  This is unedited except for me pausing it. Just like when Trump won, people stood there at the inauguration and went,
[27:58.000 --> 28:03.000]  No! When we go to these events, it's like they're toddlers.
[28:03.000 --> 28:07.000]  And by the way, I'm not defending minorities. Just a virtue signal.
[28:07.000 --> 28:17.000]  This leadership of this weird mental illness are weird white kids of weird hippie parents.
[28:17.000 --> 28:25.000]  And they're just creating this totally race-based thing where they say you're this horrible thing, so they're going to yell and scream at you.
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  Let's continue. Let's finish the clip.
[28:27.000 --> 28:31.000]  That for my wife.
[28:31.000 --> 28:39.000]  I can press charges on you for assault. I won't call corporate and get you fired. Just sell me the fucking product so I can leave.
[28:39.000 --> 28:40.000]  What do you want?
[28:40.000 --> 28:44.000]  Naked in the strawberry in a fucking six milligrams.
[28:44.000 --> 28:49.000]  I love once he does it back down to the cutbacks down, but then blows up again.

[31:32.000 --> 31:35.000]  And of course there are two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[31:35.000 --> 31:37.000]  It really is amazing.
[31:37.000 --> 31:43.000]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[31:43.000 --> 31:49.000]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will of Infowars.
[31:49.000 --> 31:54.000]  So please spread the links, infowars.com, newswars.com, christenpana.com.
[31:54.000 --> 31:57.000]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[31:57.000 --> 31:58.000]  We're all in each other's hands.
[31:58.000 --> 32:27.000]  God bless you all and thank you.
[32:28.000 --> 32:54.000]  We're all in each other's hands.
[32:54.000 --> 33:03.000]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[33:03.000 --> 33:22.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:22.000 --> 33:27.000]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[33:27.000 --> 33:56.000]  This is Alex Jones.
[33:57.000 --> 33:59.000]  I apologize.
[33:59.000 --> 34:07.000]  We are a working live international news center here in Austin, Texas called Infowars Dreaded by the Globalist.
[34:07.000 --> 34:10.000]  During the break, he called us back.
[34:10.000 --> 34:14.000]  That's right, he's coming up next segment or maybe the start of the next hour.
[34:14.000 --> 34:20.000]  In the next 30 minutes, the clip you just heard us play earlier, that's one of the top stories in the United States.
[34:20.000 --> 34:22.000]  I mean, it's everywhere.
[34:22.000 --> 34:29.000]  The gentleman is going to be on the show with us, who was in Atlanta, Georgia, and went into the vape shop.
[34:29.000 --> 34:36.000]  Unhinged leftist has meltdown, mental meltdown, refuses service to Trump supporter, physically attacks him.
[34:36.000 --> 34:38.000]  That gentleman was fired.
[34:38.000 --> 34:46.000]  Well, it turns out, of course, our Trump supporter is busy on Sunday night working repairing shell towers.
[34:46.000 --> 34:48.000]  He's on top a shell tower right now.
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.000]  He already tweeted today and put on his Facebook. We'll show it later.
[34:52.000 --> 34:58.000]  Ian Ferguson, that he's up on a cell tower fixing it in Atlanta, Georgia.
[34:58.000 --> 35:02.000]  So he's going to be joining us during his next break.
[35:02.000 --> 35:06.000]  He's got a 15-minute break and he'll be able to join us to just get into this.
[35:06.000 --> 35:13.000]  And listen, the leftist is crazy. I was at Whole Foods yesterday.
[35:13.000 --> 35:22.000]  My wife went to me to shop at Mother. I don't tell her where to shop. She shops all over. She tries not to buy from Amazon or, you know, from other global scripts that base those zones at Whole Foods.
[35:22.000 --> 35:28.000]  But she wanted some particular food there. And so we go there. It's right by our house, too.
[35:28.000 --> 35:38.000]  And like twice, dudes would walk over while I'm pushing the cart and swing their face in like an inch and say, like, you're a danger to America.
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  I'm going left.
[35:40.000 --> 35:47.000]  One guy said, you're a danger to America. I'm going left and then stomped away with his wife or his girlfriend.
[35:47.000 --> 35:50.000]  I'm like, okay, whatever that means.
[35:50.000 --> 35:59.000]  And then another guy, while I'm literally buying my daughter a stuffed animal, except at the front, they had some stuffed animals.
[35:59.000 --> 36:05.000]  He walks over and he goes, hope you're proud of what you've done. Hope you're proud.
[36:05.000 --> 36:10.000]  But we're ashamed of you. Like that. I mean, okay, well, you're a mental patient.
[36:10.000 --> 36:15.000]  But they didn't dump coffee on my head. They didn't scream at me. They were to take me outside and check my butt.
[36:15.000 --> 36:20.000]  So it's like, okay, great. Didn't say a word. Like, okay, great.
[36:20.000 --> 36:24.000]  But I should know better to go into Whole Foods.
[36:24.000 --> 36:29.000]  And by the way, once I got in the Whole Foods, the first guy in front of me, I'm like, I'm in a blue city, Austin.
[36:29.000 --> 36:32.000]  I'm in a Whole Foods. The blue is the blue.
[36:32.000 --> 36:36.000]  Don't I expect this? And I kind of do, but it's not like I'm feeling bad.
[36:36.000 --> 36:43.000]  Oh, these people are in my face. These are un-American authoritarian dirtbags who worship Jeff Bezos,
[36:43.000 --> 36:51.000]  who pays no taxes, totally ruthless, screws in his employees over, and lobbies for taxes to be raised in the middle class.
[36:51.000 --> 36:55.000]  I mean, these people are schmucks. They're chumps.
[36:55.000 --> 37:02.000]  I'm a classical liberal. I believe in lower taxes, more personal freedom, the right to defense.
[37:02.000 --> 37:07.000]  I was a libertarian 24 years ago when I got on air.
[37:07.000 --> 37:12.000]  I wasn't virtue signaling to gay people that I didn't hate them when I said I don't hate you.
[37:12.000 --> 37:18.000]  I wasn't virtue signaling, you know, when I said that people can live their own lives.
[37:18.000 --> 37:24.000]  But it's the left that won't let me live my life. And I'm sick of it. I'm tired of it.
[37:24.000 --> 37:30.000]  And you know what? I've gone through the fire. I'm not worried anymore.
[37:30.000 --> 37:38.000]  You know, I'm on a level of things, which I'm not bragging about, by the way, it's actually sickening,
[37:38.000 --> 37:42.000]  where there's very few men that'll stand up for what's right.
[37:42.000 --> 37:50.000]  So if you do that, you're immediately elevated up to contending with the globalist.
[37:50.000 --> 37:58.000]  And the average man just completely sells out of the system and they'll just do whatever.
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.000]  They'll just virtue signal to whatever the corporate America wants.
[38:02.000 --> 38:07.000]  Well, then corporate America is run by a bunch of extremists. They want submission.
[38:07.000 --> 38:15.000]  They're going to give you a request that you're not going to be able to submit to at a certain point.
[38:15.000 --> 38:20.000]  And that's what's frustrating. The globalists don't want to compromise with anybody.
[38:20.000 --> 38:24.000]  They want total power.
[38:24.000 --> 38:32.000]  Google, Facebook, Twitter, General Electric, all the Fortune 100 pay almost zero taxes,
[38:32.000 --> 38:38.000]  write the laws to pay zero taxes, fund Black Lives Matter and cop killer organizations
[38:38.000 --> 38:45.000]  and Metro La Raja as a virtue signal while Americans all fight and kill each other, their lobbying for higher taxes
[38:45.000 --> 38:56.000]  on the middle class, which they extract in government contracts, laughing all the way to the bank on us.
[38:56.000 --> 39:02.000]  And then I've got to routinely have some college educated wimp, some beta mail.
[39:02.000 --> 39:08.000]  You know, I told the story about them three weeks ago and I wish I'd have controlled myself better because I usually do.
[39:08.000 --> 39:15.000]  But I was coming up here to a Saturday show. I bought the crew breakfast tacos at a taco deli.
[39:15.000 --> 39:19.000]  And this lady walks over and she gets in my face, starts calling me all these names.
[39:19.000 --> 39:22.000]  And I just ignore it. I go, okay, lady, thanks a lot.
[39:22.000 --> 39:29.000]  And her husband leans over while I'm sitting there and bumps me with his chest and stomach into my head and goes, shut the hell up.
[39:29.000 --> 39:36.000]  And then I got up. I didn't touch him. And I started talking to him.
[39:36.000 --> 39:43.000]  They begin to panic and go, how dare you say this to us? Get away from us in front of everyone.
[39:43.000 --> 39:49.000]  They just come over and assaulted me. I mean, they got rammed into me and said, shut the F up.
[39:49.000 --> 39:53.000]  I get up, start talking. They start panicking. Oh my God, it's not, it's not like television.
[39:53.000 --> 40:02.000]  It's not a video game. He's really here. And all of a sudden, three other men and four other women who are sitting right outside the window.
[40:02.000 --> 40:07.000]  I'm sitting up against the window, run in and start going, F you racist, F you fascist.
[40:07.000 --> 40:12.000]  I'm trying to get my phone going and it's so overfilled with data. It's not videotaping and I'm sitting there.
[40:12.000 --> 40:18.000]  I got part of it on tape and they start, one guy was like, probably six, five. He goes, you got a problem?
[40:18.000 --> 40:24.000]  And I said, you know what I do? Go ahead. Let's go. Let's go. And the other guys are like, I'm a veteran.
[40:24.000 --> 40:30.000]  I was like, all of you, let's go. And I didn't start to fight. But man, I mean, give me a break.
[40:30.000 --> 40:37.000]  You guys, the mere fact there was for you against me, it had been total governors off.
[40:37.000 --> 40:41.000]  It had been not a pretty situation. And I'm not sitting here as a tough guy.
[40:41.000 --> 40:48.000]  I can't order tacos without your wife cussing at me and you cussing at me and bumping me.
[40:48.000 --> 40:53.000]  And then the minute I get up and start talking back.
[40:53.000 --> 40:59.000]  And by the way, a very quiet voice. I lean forward and I said, why are you in my face?
[40:59.000 --> 41:06.000]  This is America. Why did you just bump me and why are you cussing? And they went, oh, oh, help on.
[41:06.000 --> 41:12.000]  He's me. They went, oh, I hope you're proud of yourself. I remember they were like, Alex Jones, everyone.
[41:12.000 --> 41:21.000]  These people, it's like it was symbolic that they were going to bump me and they were going to tell me to.
[41:21.000 --> 41:29.000]  The little wimpy dude was going to tell me to f off. And then the rest of his family, big and small, came to tell me to shut up.
[41:29.000 --> 41:33.000]  And I'll be honest. It felt good to just go.
[41:33.000 --> 41:45.000]  And of course, none of them are willing to sign that check that they've been talking about.
[41:45.000 --> 41:54.000]  None of them. It's not that I'm tough. It's that you are a bunch of cowards wanted to have an expletive there, but I'm not going to do it.
[41:54.000 --> 41:59.000]  I said, no more table words, name and vein. Even though I don't take it as that, I will respect the audience and I'll do it.
[41:59.000 --> 42:10.000]  When I watch this next video of some six foot for huge dude with a pink shirt going, I'm a woman. If you come outside, I'll beat your ass.
[42:10.000 --> 42:17.000]  And it's some little liberal shopkeeper, probably five, five, like, dude, I don't mean the offense. Oh, you mean no offense.
[42:17.000 --> 42:28.000]  Even after the guy says I mean no offense. This linebacker with breast wants to piss in his face and make him submit.
[42:28.000 --> 42:33.000]  And I love even the daily color transgender woman. It's not a woman. It's a man.
[42:33.000 --> 42:41.000]  Transgender woman threatens to take it outside when GameStop employee uses the word sir.
[42:41.000 --> 42:51.000]  You got some big square jawed guy looks like Frankenstein with a wig on, bellies up to your bar and you're like Roger Stallback, what can I do for it?
[42:51.000 --> 42:59.000]  How dare you say I'm a man. You walk outside, I'm going to plaster your face on the concrete.
[42:59.000 --> 43:08.000]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[43:08.000 --> 43:17.000]  It literally dumps the population down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[43:17.000 --> 43:24.000]  First seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[43:24.000 --> 43:30.000]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2. That's been incredible.
[43:30.000 --> 43:37.000]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[43:37.000 --> 43:51.000]  But chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[43:51.000 --> 43:55.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[43:55.000 --> 44:09.000]  X3, now available at enforcelife.com.

[47:32.000 --> 47:36.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[47:36.000 --> 47:40.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[47:40.000 --> 47:43.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[47:43.000 --> 47:45.000]  Well, I was just in there during the break.
[47:45.000 --> 47:50.000]  Epic live video from on top of Cell Tower, 100 feet over the ground.
[47:50.000 --> 47:58.000]  Ian Ferguson, who shot the number one video on the internet this weekend, this vape store clerk flipping out.
[47:58.000 --> 47:59.000]  He's wearing a Trump hat.
[47:59.000 --> 48:03.000]  That's coming up right now live on this Sunday edition.
[48:03.000 --> 48:07.000]  And again, you wear a Trump hat, you figure what it's like to be at Alex Jones or Donald Trump.
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.000]  I go out in public in many areas.
[48:09.000 --> 48:13.000]  People either buy my dinner and pat me on the back, or they try to physically attack me.
[48:13.000 --> 48:16.000]  But since I've mentioned it, here's dailycaller.com.
[48:16.000 --> 48:20.000]  A transgender woman threatens to take it outside.
[48:20.000 --> 48:23.000]  It's not a woman, it's a big dude with giant shoulders.
[48:23.000 --> 48:35.000]  When GameStop employee uses the word sir, again, this is a big dude, looks like a big dude, big square job, looks like, again, Frankenstein.
[48:35.000 --> 48:37.000]  And then starts getting really threatening.
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.000]  He's not just acting like a dude, he's acting like a jerk.
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.000]  Here it is.
[48:41.000 --> 48:45.000]  Excuse me, sir, there's a young man in here.
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  Excuse me, it's ma'am.
[48:47.000 --> 48:48.000]  It is ma'am.
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  I can call the police if you'd like me to.
[48:50.000 --> 48:51.000]  You need to settle down.
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  You need to settle down and mind your business.
[48:53.000 --> 48:56.000]  Ma'am, once again, ma'am.
[48:56.000 --> 48:57.000]  I said both of you.
[48:57.000 --> 48:58.000]  No, you said sir.
[48:58.000 --> 49:00.000]  Once again, it's ma'am.
[49:00.000 --> 49:01.000]  I actually said both of you guys.
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.000]  Right beforehand, you f***ing said sir.
[49:04.000 --> 49:05.000]  Sir?
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  F***ing take it outside.
[49:07.000 --> 49:10.000]  If you want to call me sir again, I will show you a f***ing sir.
[49:10.000 --> 49:11.000]  I followed you.
[49:11.000 --> 49:12.000]  I followed you.
[49:12.000 --> 49:21.000]  I need your corporate number because I'm going to call them and talk about how it's misgendered
[49:21.000 --> 49:22.000]  several times in the store.
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  Misgendered, which is a law in California.
[49:24.000 --> 49:25.000]  I need your corporate number now.
[49:25.000 --> 49:27.000]  It starts kicking stuff over.
[49:27.000 --> 49:28.000]  It just goes on and on.
[49:28.000 --> 49:31.000]  But I want to get to our special guest, Big Exclusive here.
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  Let's play a minute or two.
[49:33.000 --> 49:34.000]  It's like a four minute video.
[49:34.000 --> 49:35.000]  It's up on infowars.com.
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  Tens of millions of views online.
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  It's from dredgereport.com, linking to it.
[49:39.000 --> 49:44.000]  Unhinged leftist has mental breakdown and refuses service for Trump supporter.
[49:44.000 --> 49:45.000]  Invade shop.
[49:45.000 --> 49:49.000]  We're going to find out what happened before, what happened after, but here is part of that
[49:49.000 --> 49:50.000]  video.
[49:50.000 --> 49:55.000]  So here we are, ex-Hale of vapor city in Tuck, Georgia, and I have just been asked to leave
[49:55.000 --> 49:56.000]  the store.
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  He greeted me.
[49:58.000 --> 49:59.000]  That was nice.
[49:59.000 --> 50:03.000]  I did find the item that I wanted and the next thing he said was that he'd like me to leave.
[50:03.000 --> 50:07.000]  If you do not stop recording in my store, I'm going to call the police and ask you to leave
[50:07.000 --> 50:08.000]  now.
[50:08.000 --> 50:09.000]  That would be awesome.
[50:09.000 --> 50:10.000]  That would be awesome.
[50:10.000 --> 50:13.000]  We can call Fox five and all sorts of stuff.
[50:13.000 --> 50:16.000]  He's got to protect himself from this limb bag.
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.000]  Please do call your boss because I will be calling corporate.
[50:19.000 --> 50:20.000]  Go for it.
[50:20.000 --> 50:25.000]  I am looking forward to releasing this video because I just want to purchase something f***
[50:25.000 --> 50:26.000]  up.
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  Get the f*** up in here.
[50:28.000 --> 50:29.000]  Get the f*** up, man.
[50:29.000 --> 50:30.000]  Get the f*** up.
[50:30.000 --> 50:31.000]  Get the f*** up, man.
[50:31.000 --> 50:32.000]  Get the f*** up, man.
[50:32.000 --> 50:33.000]  Get the f*** up, man.
[50:33.000 --> 50:34.000]  Get the f*** up, man.
[50:34.000 --> 50:35.000]  Get the f*** up, man.
[50:35.000 --> 50:36.000]  Get the f*** up, man.
[50:36.000 --> 50:37.000]  Get the f*** up, man.
[50:37.000 --> 50:38.000]  Get the f*** up, man.
[50:38.000 --> 50:39.000]  You don't even do anything.
[50:39.000 --> 50:40.000]  You very much got to get this f*** up.
[50:40.000 --> 50:41.000]  Just look at that.
[50:41.000 --> 50:42.000]  That was an idiot, a racist white guy, obsessed with racing and transportation.
[50:42.000 --> 50:43.000]  Let's stop there.
[50:43.000 --> 50:44.000]  We'll play more of the video and get into the next hour.
[50:44.000 --> 50:49.100]  But he's on top, on his break, on top of a cell tower.
[50:49.100 --> 50:50.100]  Working on it.
[50:50.100 --> 50:51.100]  He's Ian Ferguson.
[50:51.100 --> 50:55.900]  I left out on a Sunday night, the second last day of the year, this guy is working for
[50:55.900 --> 50:58.160]  his family.
[50:58.160 --> 51:00.000]  And we've got the exclusive with him right now.
[51:00.000 --> 51:02.780]  I want to get into what happened, what happened before you started taping.
[51:02.780 --> 51:04.880]  Smart for you to do that half the time.
[51:04.880 --> 51:06.940]  I forget when this happens.
[51:06.940 --> 51:09.540]  Thank you for joining us Ian Ferguson.
[51:09.540 --> 51:12.140]  Hey, not just Sunday, it's my birthday.
[51:12.140 --> 51:13.420]  How are you doing, Alex?
[51:13.420 --> 51:16.020]  Good, brother, are you familiar with the show?
[51:16.020 --> 51:17.540]  Man, I've been watching you forever.
[51:17.540 --> 51:19.380]  I'm sorry what they did to you on YouTube, man.
[51:19.380 --> 51:20.620]  That's some bullshit.
[51:20.620 --> 51:21.900]  It's all right, we're gonna delay that,
[51:21.900 --> 51:25.500]  but we're on a lot of radio and TV stations.
[51:25.500 --> 51:26.660]  Wherever you wanna start, my friend,
[51:26.660 --> 51:28.540]  we appreciate you while you're up there working on top.
[51:28.540 --> 51:30.620]  I can see the cell tower right there you're hanging on.
[51:30.620 --> 51:32.340]  I mean, describe what happened.
[51:32.340 --> 51:33.500]  Climb down, I'm on the ground now.
[51:33.500 --> 51:35.060]  Oh, you finally came, earlier you're up there.
[51:35.060 --> 51:37.820]  We should have had you all when you were up there, sorry.
[51:37.820 --> 51:40.100]  That's what we were aiming for, it didn't work out.
[51:40.100 --> 51:41.300]  It's all right, go ahead.
[51:42.260 --> 51:44.540]  All right, so what can I tell you, man?
[51:44.540 --> 51:46.220]  I wanna talk all about it, what's up?
[51:46.220 --> 51:48.020]  Well, no, I mean describe going in,
[51:48.020 --> 51:50.420]  you're trying to get your wife some strawberry vape.
[51:50.420 --> 51:52.260]  I mean, what unfolded?
[51:52.260 --> 51:55.100]  Well, look, so I've been going there for years
[51:55.100 --> 51:57.020]  and I've actually got a story about this place,
[51:57.020 --> 51:58.740]  it's pretty cool, but I don't know,
[51:58.740 --> 52:00.220]  I was just standing there for a couple of minutes
[52:00.220 --> 52:02.460]  waiting on him to get done with the customer
[52:02.460 --> 52:05.300]  and they come up from the back of the store
[52:05.300 --> 52:07.420]  and he greeted me a second time
[52:07.420 --> 52:10.060]  and then as soon as he's like got a real good look at me,
[52:10.060 --> 52:11.820]  he said, no, you can go ahead and leave the store
[52:11.820 --> 52:13.420]  and I knew it was on, I grabbed the phone,
[52:13.420 --> 52:15.260]  turned on the video and it just ran.
[52:17.220 --> 52:19.020]  Well, again, if someone doesn't put on
[52:19.020 --> 52:22.380]  infowars.com shirt or a Trump shirt,
[52:22.380 --> 52:24.220]  they don't know how bad it is,
[52:24.220 --> 52:26.460]  but you put the uniform on,
[52:26.460 --> 52:29.900]  were you thinking that when you went in, what unfolded?
[52:29.900 --> 52:34.900]  You know, honestly, I had that thought
[52:35.100 --> 52:36.380]  as I was getting out of the truck
[52:36.380 --> 52:39.020]  that something felt different about it this time.
[52:39.020 --> 52:41.700]  You know, I've been in and out of that store for years now,
[52:41.700 --> 52:45.540]  but yes, I definitely had a, I don't know,
[52:45.540 --> 52:49.300]  premonition, hair, goose, pimples,
[52:49.300 --> 52:50.220]  whatever you want to call it.
[52:50.220 --> 52:52.300]  Yeah, something felt different.
[52:52.300 --> 52:53.780]  Well, it's definitely the number one video
[52:53.780 --> 52:54.860]  right now on YouTube.
[52:54.860 --> 52:58.340]  So, I mean, obviously the video picks part of it,
[52:58.340 --> 53:00.580]  this guy like slapping, he's hitting you,
[53:00.580 --> 53:02.780]  he's attacking you, you're being very calm.
[53:02.780 --> 53:04.220]  I mean, what was that like?
[53:05.780 --> 53:08.220]  Honestly, it was more exhilarating than anything.
[53:08.220 --> 53:10.060]  I mean, the guy's not a credible threat.
[53:11.420 --> 53:14.220]  I've been in trouble, I've been in danger
[53:14.220 --> 53:16.460]  and he was more laughable than anything.
[53:16.460 --> 53:18.180]  I feel bad for the guy.
[53:18.180 --> 53:20.580]  He don't ruin his life, he's home somewhere,
[53:20.580 --> 53:22.780]  not working right now, you know?
[53:22.780 --> 53:25.900]  He did get fired, but I mean, specifically,
[53:25.900 --> 53:28.500]  you live in Atlanta, how often do you go out
[53:28.500 --> 53:30.100]  and wear a Trump paraphernalia?
[53:31.100 --> 53:32.860]  All the time, all the time.
[53:34.300 --> 53:36.300]  As soon as I found out that it could potentially
[53:36.300 --> 53:39.340]  trigger somebody, I knew I wanted to be part of that.
[53:40.700 --> 53:43.180]  Just something about the strength of the message,
[53:43.180 --> 53:45.220]  make America great again, we're united.
[53:45.220 --> 53:47.660]  It's a, there's a network of us out there,
[53:47.660 --> 53:49.020]  they say we're the silent majority
[53:49.020 --> 53:50.820]  and that is so far from the truth.
[53:52.180 --> 53:54.380]  Well, I'm asking my questions Ian Ferguson,
[53:54.380 --> 53:56.060]  but I want you to specifically, obviously,
[53:56.060 --> 53:57.780]  you know it's been the top story for two days
[53:57.780 --> 53:59.820]  on the Rudge Report, it's been seen millions of times
[53:59.820 --> 54:01.620]  on a bunch of different platforms
[54:01.620 --> 54:03.180]  and this is happening everywhere
[54:03.180 --> 54:04.940]  to Trump supporters where they're physically attacked.
[54:04.940 --> 54:06.700]  I'm glad you showed this.
[54:06.700 --> 54:08.700]  What do you think's gonna come out of this?
[54:12.660 --> 54:17.060]  I couldn't really tell you that I'm not prescient,
[54:17.060 --> 54:18.620]  I don't see the future.
[54:18.620 --> 54:21.060]  I didn't see this phone call happening yesterday.
[54:21.060 --> 54:24.980]  I'd like to see a little bit more tolerance.
[54:24.980 --> 54:29.020]  I'd really like to see some of the Trump supporters
[54:29.020 --> 54:30.300]  out there grow some backbones
[54:30.300 --> 54:32.140]  and start standing up for themselves.
[54:32.140 --> 54:34.900]  The days of feelings running the world are over
[54:34.900 --> 54:37.100]  and it's about time for people to wake up
[54:37.100 --> 54:39.340]  and realize that logic runs the train now.
[54:40.860 --> 54:43.780]  What happened, the video's like three and a half minutes long.
[54:43.780 --> 54:47.180]  What happened once the clip went dark?
[54:49.500 --> 54:50.940]  You know, I haven't really watched it that much,
[54:50.940 --> 54:52.380]  but I remember what happened.
[54:52.380 --> 54:56.460]  Right around that time, let's see, what was at the end of it?
[54:56.460 --> 54:59.060]  At the end of it, the other customer,
[54:59.060 --> 55:02.220]  he was telling the guy behind the counter,
[55:02.220 --> 55:04.300]  man, it's about money, it's about skin color,
[55:04.300 --> 55:05.580]  what color is your cash?
[55:05.580 --> 55:08.780]  And he just wasn't going for it and it was getting worse.
[55:08.780 --> 55:10.180]  It was time for me to go on out of there
[55:10.180 --> 55:11.380]  before I got in trouble.
[55:17.340 --> 55:19.100]  Yeah, no, very end.
[55:19.100 --> 55:22.460]  Let's see, I told him, go fuck yourself, Trump's the president.
[55:22.460 --> 55:25.100]  The other customer he was just talking about,
[55:25.100 --> 55:28.660]  man, my cash is green, his cash is green.
[55:30.020 --> 55:30.980]  Let me bring this up.
[55:30.980 --> 55:33.940]  I mean, look, if I was a small-cake company owner
[55:33.940 --> 55:35.500]  and people just wanted me to put two dudes on the cake,
[55:35.500 --> 55:38.100]  I'd do it, but I get small companies have a right to say no,
[55:38.100 --> 55:39.740]  but big companies especially shouldn't.
[55:39.740 --> 55:42.500]  You're wearing a hat, why would he refuse your service?
[55:42.500 --> 55:44.780]  Why would he go so hysterical?
[55:44.780 --> 55:47.100]  I mean, obviously he's been fired now.
[55:47.100 --> 55:48.620]  This is blown up with our face.
[55:48.620 --> 55:50.700]  A lot of places the left would actually celebrate
[55:50.700 --> 55:51.540]  what happened to you.
[55:51.540 --> 55:54.140]  I mean, they are nationwide saying that guy's a hero,
[55:54.140 --> 55:54.980]  the left is.
[55:56.700 --> 55:58.220]  That's hilarious.
[56:00.260 --> 56:02.100]  I mean, he stood up for what he believed
[56:02.100 --> 56:04.020]  in the same way I did.
[56:04.020 --> 56:05.860]  His was just a little bit more laughable.
[56:05.860 --> 56:08.020]  Let me ask you this, at a certain point you get mad
[56:08.020 --> 56:10.660]  after he slaps you for, it looks like for a second time,
[56:10.660 --> 56:12.100]  correct me if I'm wrong, then you say,
[56:12.100 --> 56:14.260]  come on, punk, do it again.
[56:14.260 --> 56:15.740]  So you did get a little hot there.
[56:15.740 --> 56:19.160]  What got you hot at that moment?
[56:19.160 --> 56:22.220]  Um, you know, I really can't put my finger,
[56:22.220 --> 56:24.420]  seven times through anger management, Alex.
[56:24.420 --> 56:26.900]  I'm a reformed criminal.
[56:28.580 --> 56:30.140]  As soon as he took a second swipe,
[56:30.140 --> 56:32.820]  I really just wanted to put my hands on him.
[56:32.820 --> 56:34.660]  And that was the end of it.
[56:34.660 --> 56:36.700]  Look at the video, he kind of looks like a beta male.
[56:36.700 --> 56:38.900]  You don't look like a wimp.
[56:38.900 --> 56:39.740]  I know the look.
[56:39.740 --> 56:40.980]  I mean, you don't look like a wimp.
[56:40.980 --> 56:41.980]  What was he thinking?
[56:42.980 --> 56:44.420]  I couldn't tell you what he was thinking.
[56:44.420 --> 56:47.300]  I don't believe that I give off the impression
[56:47.300 --> 56:49.500]  that I'm somebody to play around with.
[56:51.220 --> 56:55.020]  But hey, he wanted to play games, so there it is.
[56:55.020 --> 56:56.580]  But what about the poor black guy
[56:56.580 --> 56:57.820]  that he keeps virtue signaling?
[56:57.820 --> 57:00.020]  I know he called you the N word, the white guy did.
[57:00.020 --> 57:02.180]  He's hopping around the black guys like waving his hands
[57:02.180 --> 57:03.740]  around like, this is ridiculous.
[57:04.620 --> 57:07.500]  Man, he would, wait, I could see the look of pain
[57:07.500 --> 57:09.720]  on his face that he just didn't want to be involved
[57:09.720 --> 57:10.660]  in any of it.
[57:10.660 --> 57:12.460]  Like it had nothing to do with him.
[57:12.460 --> 57:16.300]  He just wanted to buy whatever it was he was trying to buy.
[57:16.300 --> 57:18.420]  And he even got into the argument at the end
[57:18.420 --> 57:20.180]  just talking about, man, my cash is green.
[57:20.180 --> 57:21.020]  So is his.
[57:21.020 --> 57:22.500]  Let's just do this thing.
[57:22.500 --> 57:23.340]  Hey, he was just-
[57:23.340 --> 57:25.420]  Oh, so tell us about that when we come back in two minutes.
[57:25.420 --> 57:27.220]  So at the end of the day, the black guy was like,
[57:27.220 --> 57:29.740]  yeah, dude, sell him his stuff.
[57:29.740 --> 57:32.300]  Yeah, no, he knew what was up.
[57:33.540 --> 57:34.980]  Kid was just going nuts.
[57:35.940 --> 57:38.060]  And again, it was black people doing all this, I'd say,
[57:38.060 --> 57:40.860]  but it's not, it's a bunch of weird white wimps
[57:40.860 --> 57:42.580]  that are looking for a fight.
[57:42.580 --> 57:43.780]  And then once the fight starts,
[57:43.780 --> 57:46.540]  they crap their bitch britches and run to mommy.
[57:46.540 --> 57:49.180]  We'll be back with Ian Ferguson.
[57:49.180 --> 57:52.020]  For those of us that are the tip of the spear,
[57:52.020 --> 57:54.380]  we're being targeted to take out the leadership.
[57:54.380 --> 57:56.300]  That's the globalist only hope.
[57:56.300 --> 57:57.940]  So when you support info wars,
[57:57.940 --> 57:59.260]  when you spread our articles and videos,
[57:59.260 --> 58:01.740]  when you buy products at info wars store.com,
[58:01.740 --> 58:03.580]  you are literally not just supporting info wars
[58:03.580 --> 58:05.740]  and free speech and standing and defianceing
[58:05.740 --> 58:08.140]  and Soros and Hillary and the rest of these people,
[58:08.140 --> 58:10.940]  but you are standing for your own future
[58:10.940 --> 58:13.700]  and your own best shot of having an early warning system
[58:13.700 --> 58:15.820]  in America standing against these individuals.
[58:15.820 --> 58:17.820]  When you order products at info wars store.com,
[58:17.820 --> 58:20.020]  you fund not just an American revolution,
[58:20.020 --> 58:22.100]  but a global revolution against tyranny.
[58:22.100 --> 58:24.540]  And we have the biggest specials ever running throughout
[58:24.540 --> 58:27.660]  to the end of the year as part of a total store clearance.
[58:27.660 --> 58:30.180]  Every order gets a free t-shirt.
[58:30.180 --> 58:31.340]  Every order gets free shipping.
[58:31.340 --> 58:34.540]  Every order gets 50 to 75% off in total clearance.
[58:34.540 --> 58:37.540]  And that funding allows us to go into the new year
[58:37.540 --> 58:39.620]  on sure footing to fund ourselves
[58:39.620 --> 58:41.580]  throughout the first part of the year
[58:41.580 --> 58:43.460]  to not just fight, but to expand.
[58:43.460 --> 58:45.380]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[58:45.380 --> 58:46.420]  I salute you all.
[58:46.420 --> 58:49.020]  Now please take action at infowarstore.com.
[58:50.580 --> 58:52.620]  Please, whatever you do realize,
[58:52.620 --> 58:54.700]  that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[58:54.700 --> 58:56.820]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts,
[58:56.820 --> 58:58.300]  they say affiliated with info wars.
[58:58.300 --> 59:00.100]  Yes, some of them are like little side accounts.
[59:00.100 --> 59:02.100]  They even know we had like info war store
[59:02.100 --> 59:03.340]  that just showed our products,
[59:03.340 --> 59:05.380]  but they just banned them all yesterday
[59:05.380 --> 59:07.700]  in punishment that I be in a Trump rally
[59:07.700 --> 59:10.020]  and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[59:10.020 --> 59:11.500]  Your excitement about America,
[59:11.500 --> 59:12.780]  your excitement about this broadcast
[59:12.780 --> 59:14.660]  is what brought the country and the world back
[59:14.660 --> 59:15.500]  from the brick.
[59:15.500 --> 59:17.580]  But the globalists now wanna target
[59:17.580 --> 59:19.260]  where the resistance came from
[59:19.260 --> 59:21.420]  so that we're not pesky in the future.
[59:21.420 --> 59:24.500]  I wanna be troublesome and pesky.
[59:24.500 --> 59:25.460]  I wanna keep going.
[59:25.460 --> 59:27.860]  I wanna make them do the ultimate,
[59:27.860 --> 59:29.460]  not just destroy us financially.
[59:29.460 --> 59:31.460]  I want to push all the way.
[59:31.460 --> 59:32.740]  I've committed to do that.
[59:32.740 --> 59:33.820]  I've prayed for that.
[59:33.820 --> 59:35.500]  And I've been told that's going to happen,
[59:35.500 --> 59:38.340]  but you've got a back ish and I promise you this.
[59:38.340 --> 59:39.700]  I will never falter.
[59:39.700 --> 59:42.060]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[59:42.060 --> 59:43.020]  I physically will.
[59:43.020 --> 59:44.580]  But I give you my commitment
[59:44.580 --> 59:45.940]  if you financially support us
[59:45.940 --> 59:47.860]  infowarstore.com to give you
[59:47.860 --> 59:49.980]  my absolute total commitment.
[59:53.700 --> 59:56.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:56.740 --> 01:00:01.740]  You gave me more time.
[01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:04.740]  You gave me fire.
[01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:06.740]  You gave me power.
[01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:09.740]  Give me your God's name.
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:14.740]  I'm every person you need to be.
[01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:20.740]  Oh, I love you so much.
[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:25.740]  I love you so much.
[01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:30.740]  I love you so much.
[01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:35.740]  I love you so much.
[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:38.740]  I love you so much.
[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:42.740]  Knock what your country can do for you.
[01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:44.740]  Well, there's been a lot of red-blooded Americans
[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:45.740]  that built this country,
[01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:48.740]  but 30 minutes ago when they were first getting this guest on,
[01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:50.740]  he's up on top of the cell tower,
[01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:52.740]  and he's showing the shots down on the ground.
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:53.740]  I'm like, get him on,
[01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:54.740]  but he had to get out the tower by nighttime.
[01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:57.740]  So now Ian Ferguson is in his truck
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:00:58.740]  about to leave for the night,
[01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:01.740]  and I just hope that he gets this live interview
[01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:03.740]  later uploaded to his own YouTube channel
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:06.740]  with millions of views on him going to this vape shop
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:08.740]  in Atlanta and some libtard,
[01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:10.740]  I think they're calling him vape-tard,
[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:12.740]  blows up at him in front of a black guy
[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:14.740]  and starts calling you the N-word,
[01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:16.740]  and the black guy's like,
[01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:17.740]  I know it's on the video,
[01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:18.740]  he's like, hey, dude, you need to stop it.
[01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:20.740]  Just sell him his stuff.
[01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:25.740]  How would you quantify the liberal derangement syndrome
[01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:26.740]  that's going on?
[01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:31.740]  How would I quantify that?
[01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:33.740]  I mean, where is it going?
[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:35.740]  Because they're getting crazier.
[01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:36.740]  Aren't they though?
[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:38.740]  Well, look, here's the thing.
[01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:41.740]  All right, so they've been raised,
[01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:44.740]  everybody participates, everybody gets a trophy,
[01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:45.740]  everybody gets a ribbon,
[01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:46.740]  they've never been told no.
[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:48.740]  Dr. Spock got a hold of their parents in the 80s
[01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:50.740]  and messed up their game.
[01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:52.740]  So, when they run across an alpha
[01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:55.740]  that doesn't have a problem telling them no
[01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:56.740]  and it's firm in it,
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:58.740]  they've gotten nowhere to resort,
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:03.740]  but just a very basic scream mentality
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:05.740]  takes them right back to childhood.
[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:07.740]  It's the only thing I can figure.
[01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:09.740]  Well, you're definitely, you say you're not that smart,
[01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:10.740]  then you're the idiot, Savan.
[01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:11.740]  I say you're Savan.
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:13.740]  That's it, it's toddler behavior.
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:15.740]  It's literal screaming,
[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:20.740]  screaming, like I've had a bump me and hit me.
[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:21.740]  And then when I say, hey, watch it, they go,
[01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:23.740]  oh my God, you're threatening me.
[01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:26.740]  It's like, no, you just ran into me.
[01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:28.740]  Yeah, no, it's very animalistic.
[01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:30.740]  It's a, you see the same thing
[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:32.740]  when a man gets back into a corner
[01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:34.740]  and has nowhere to go.
[01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:36.740]  It's just all the primal comes out.
[01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:38.740]  It is what it is.
[01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:40.740]  But they take their back into a corner
[01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:41.740]  but they're such betas
[01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:43.740]  and they're trying to back us into a corner
[01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:45.740]  and they keep thinking as they double down
[01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:46.740]  intimidation we're going to give up
[01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:48.740]  and then as we intensify the fight
[01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:50.740]  they get really freaked out.
[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:53.740]  Most people aren't bred for conflict.
[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:55.740]  Most people don't handle it well.
[01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:58.740]  Conflict isn't, it's not comfortable.
[01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:00.740]  Chained equals pain and all that.
[01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:02.740]  But listen, I've been asking the questions here.
[01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:03.740]  I want to do this segment
[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:04.740]  and then actually get back to your wife.
[01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:07.740]  Did your wife finally get her strawberry vape?
[01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:08.740]  Yes.
[01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:10.740]  I actually went right down the street
[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:11.740]  to another vape shop.
[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:13.740]  I was on the way home and just saw this like
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:16.740]  little bitty, kind of shack looking thing
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:17.740]  and I went in there.
[01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:19.740]  I don't know if you've seen the second video.
[01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:20.740]  There's actually three of them now.
[01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.740]  But the second one was at a video shop
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:24.740]  right across the street.
[01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:26.740]  Really nice girl.
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:29.740]  Mixed girl, she's a liberal Democrat
[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:31.740]  and come to find out she'd never been in trouble
[01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:32.740]  with the law whatsoever
[01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:34.740]  and there she is standing there talking to me about it.
[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:36.740]  She was just floored in the video.
[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:37.740]  She was the first person to saw it
[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:39.740]  as a matter of fact, names Casey.
[01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:41.740]  That's my next question.
[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:42.740]  Your video cuts out.
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:43.740]  Why did it cut out?
[01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:45.740]  And then what happened next in there
[01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:47.740]  with this guy that wouldn't sell you strawberry vape?
[01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:49.740]  Well, nothing happened after that.
[01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:51.740]  I was cutting the video off as I was leaving.
[01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:52.740]  Right about the time I gave him the figure
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:54.740]  and told him the Trump was still his president,
[01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:56.740]  I was packing it up to leave.
[01:03:56.740 --> 01:03:59.740]  But you did try to let him sell you the product.
[01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:02.740]  Yeah, man, I tried to bargain with him.
[01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:04.740]  Dude, give me the thing and I won't call the cops.
[01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:05.740]  I won't call corporate.
[01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:07.740]  Just do your job.
[01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:09.740]  He wasn't having it.
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:11.740]  Just wasn't having it.
[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:13.740]  He seemed totally disconnected
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:15.740]  because even if you're a tough guy
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:17.740]  on the wrong day or your ass kicked,
[01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:19.740]  he's like starting to fight with a pretty tough looking dude
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:21.740]  and yelling N word out.
[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:22.740]  You know, that's on the video too.
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:24.740]  What was that about?
[01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:27.740]  Um, virtue signaling.
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:30.740]  Potentially maybe he was trying to gas up his customer
[01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:32.740]  to make a better sale
[01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:35.740]  and convince the customer that he was,
[01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:38.740]  I don't know, on the right side of the race garden,
[01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:40.740]  whatever.
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:42.740]  Didn't look like the right dude bought into it.
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:43.740]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:44.740]  One more segment with our guest
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:46.740]  where he goes down the road to be with his wife
[01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:48.740]  and he works on cell towers all day on Sunday.
[01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:50.740]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:52.740]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:54.740]  Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[01:04:57.740 --> 01:05:00.740]  So as we prepare to close out 2018,
[01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:03.740]  just remember, this life is a test.
[01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:05.740]  And those of you that have been listening and watching
[01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:07.740]  and taking action, the victories of populism
[01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:10.740]  and nationalism and Christianity coming back from the dead
[01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.740]  and recognizing it's being persecuted,
[01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:15.740]  that's all because you are the core.
[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:17.740]  Listening to M4 Wars around the world,
[01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:19.740]  the eyes and ears of liberty
[01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:23.740]  that were immune or at least resistant
[01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:25.740]  to the globalist programming.
[01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:27.740]  Everybody knows who studies this,
[01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:29.740]  that it's Christians, real Christians,
[01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:32.740]  who tend to be immune to the globalist brainwashing
[01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:34.740]  and who tend to see it.
[01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:36.740]  And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:39.740]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying.
[01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:41.740]  2018 has been insane.
[01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:44.740]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker.
[01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:48.740]  And I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:50.740]  Not behind us, but right beside us
[01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:51.740]  and at the heart of everything
[01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:52.740]  resisting these globalists.
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:54.740]  So whatever you do, take action and realize
[01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:57.740]  we're changing history together and I salute you.
[01:05:57.740 --> 01:06:01.740]  We've got it.
[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:08.740]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:13.740]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live
[01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:16.740]  from the front lines of the Info War.
[01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:22.740]  Well, I'm really glad that our producer Daria
[01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:25.740]  and others got the gentleman Ian Ferguson on.
[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:27.740]  He's been the number one story this weekend
[01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:29.740]  on dredgerport.com.
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:31.740]  It's one of the top videos on YouTube, Facebook.
[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:33.740]  It's everywhere.
[01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:36.740]  It's the top commented article on infowars.com.
[01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:41.740]  And he just walks into a vape shop in Atlanta, Georgia.
[01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:44.740]  He's a hard-working guy that works on cell towers.
[01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:46.740]  And again, a lot of you already saw this,
[01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:47.740]  but I'm recap from new viewers.
[01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:49.740]  He listens every 10 seconds.
[01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:53.740]  And he just shows up and this dude flips out on him
[01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:55.740]  and says, get out of here, racist.
[01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:57.740]  Get out of here, inward.
[01:06:57.740 --> 01:06:59.740]  And there's a black dude in the video going,
[01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:02.740]  hey man, he's trying to at a big vape shop.
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:04.740]  Hey dude, just sell him stuff.
[01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:05.740]  And the black dude totally gets it.
[01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:09.740]  It's again, it's weird white people who are leftist.
[01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:12.740]  Think it's like a magic word like hocus pocus.
[01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:13.740]  Or what is that?
[01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:14.740]  What's that guy's name?
[01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:15.740]  Harry Potter.
[01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:18.740]  He's got some magic word and you say it
[01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:21.740]  and they just think it does everything.
[01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:23.740]  So we'll tell you this gentleman's YouTube
[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:25.740]  and his Facebook, so you can follow it.
[01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:27.740]  But he's just a regular, you know,
[01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:28.740]  citizen out there doing it.
[01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:30.740]  Here's the video clip of what happened.
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:33.740]  Here we are in exhale Vapor City in Tucker, Georgia.
[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:36.740]  And I have just been asked to leave the store.
[01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:37.740]  He greeted me.
[01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:38.740]  That was nice.
[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:40.740]  I did find the item that I wanted.
[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:43.740]  And the next thing he said was that he'd like to leave.
[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:45.740]  If you do not stop recording in my store,
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:47.740]  I'm going to call the police and ask you to leave now.
[01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:49.740]  Please call the, that'll be awesome.
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:50.740]  That'll be awesome.
[01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:51.740]  Alright.
[01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:52.740]  We can call Fox 5 and all sorts of stuff.
[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:53.740]  I'd like to.
[01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:55.740]  I'd like to purchase something here.
[01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:59.740]  Please do call your boss because I will be calling corporate.
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:00.740]  Go for it.

[01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:40.540]  because you absolutely people watch the whole video you totally pimp that guy
[01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:48.580]  in retrospect what I did was set myself up for a whole bunch of trouble I could
[01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:52.100]  have gone back to jail real easy it wouldn't have taken much for that all
[01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:59.020]  that anger management slip and here Ian is back in prison so I appreciate the
[01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:03.900]  credit and like gas in my head up but in reality I've got to stop with my
[01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:12.220]  situation no but this is America and Trump is our president and you know you
[01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:16.540]  have a right to wear a red white blue damn shirt I mean you know do we have a
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:21.260]  country left if you can't do this without some jerk get in your face all
[01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:24.540]  right now you're absolutely right it's freedom of speech thank God bless
[01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:28.460]  America I'll wear what I want I'll roll down the street and once one roller
[01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:32.660]  skating a pink thong if I want to it's America and yeah you're absolutely right
[01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:36.340]  he's got no right to say one way well now he's got every right to say whatever
[01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:41.460]  you want to write there's no right to attack you twice that's true well I was
[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:44.300]  you it was I'm glad you had restraint because I've had him slap me in the head
[01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:48.460]  to it's never that hard and report coffee on me because I get I'm winning by
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:53.820]  letting him do it but how did you keep yourself from punching I've been to
[01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:58.380]  prison that's that's how I kept myself from doing it you get locked behind the
[01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:00.900]  walls with a couple guys that want to rape you in the middle of the night and
[01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:06.780]  have to poke a hole and you won't ever want to go back I promise you and that's
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:11.060]  the difference because you've been in the real world that SJW I bet still lives
[01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:14.340]  in mama's basement and I'm not bashing folks live with her mama but the point is
[01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:20.300]  this guy literally doesn't even know who he's messing with he doesn't as I can
[01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:23.020]  see the video I'm not just saying this I can tell you're you know you're you're
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:27.220]  chiseled to tough looking nice guy you're confident there's this little wimpy
[01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:31.980]  guy literally trying to like make himself big by threatening you virtue
[01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:35.260]  signaling me some black guy the black guy is looking at you and going hey man
[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:39.860]  I'm not in the middle of this I mean this this video I think illustrates
[01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:48.140]  everything we're dealing with absolutely absolutely and I really can't speak to
[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:52.500]  his mindset because I just I don't follow it there's no common ground for me
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:56.980]  to understand well the word is you know the company gets Atlanta's half
[01:10:56.980 --> 01:11:00.300]  conservatives they want to lose half their I'm glad the company didn't virtue
[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:04.060]  signal and say that their guy was great they fired his ass instantly I mean I
[01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:09.700]  wonder what he's gonna do now I don't know honestly I'm considering starting
[01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:13.060]  to go fund me for him and I feel bad for the guy I know what it's like to be out
[01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:17.220]  of work let me tell you I would I would pay for the hotel on the time with that

[01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:18.100]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front
[01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:33.540]  lines of the info war so in the West and the Christian ethos we believe in
[01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:41.460]  empowering the weak but doesn't mean we believe in holding back strong and so we
[01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:48.020]  believe in letting people have their own freedom that's free will and I
[01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:51.180]  played this video earlier but I'll play it one more time because it's so
[01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:57.100]  illustrative transgender woman threatens to take it outside when
[01:20:57.100 --> 01:21:03.260]  GameStop employee uses the serwards like a six foot four two hundred and fifty
[01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:11.620]  pound person yelling and screaming and kicking over products and getting in
[01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:20.580]  everybody's face because they supposedly have used the wrong pronoun I mean I'm
[01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:23.300]  still trying to figure out all this transgender stuff and I can't figure out
[01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:28.740]  the pronouns and all the rules in California you're arrested if you use
[01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:32.740]  the wrong gender name I mean if I want to call a woman a man a man a woman I
[01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:36.820]  should be able to I want to call a cat a dog I want to call a storm cloud and
[01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:43.020]  Easter Bunny I should be able to but now it's into the hundreds and hundreds of
[01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:48.580]  pronouns why Germany I saw CNN reported yesterday Germany's added a third
[01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:54.020]  gender and I want to look at the article and this person has a mutation and has
[01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:58.820]  both genitals which happens in you know one half a million people and now with
[01:21:58.820 --> 01:22:01.420]  all the chemicals it happens with more and I'm you're right you're like yeah
[01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:09.220]  there actually are genders where people got both male genitals but they rarely
[01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:13.420]  have even though it's rare to have this a uterus and testicles in fact that's
[01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:19.140]  almost never found so scientists go with whether you have a uterus and and and
[01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:25.020]  ovaries or whether you have testicles but the point is is that a man that six
[01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:31.400]  foot four and got male genitals marches into a GameStop in Albuquerque and you
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:38.020]  Mexico and he sits back and he says why you called me sir I'm gonna take you
[01:22:38.020 --> 01:22:46.300]  outside he's the bully he's the bad guy you know this liberal looks like a total
[01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:50.420]  liberal pretty man this is like listen I just said you guys that's just a term
[01:22:50.420 --> 01:23:01.420]  shut up you said sir and that's just illustrative of how the left uses our
[01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:08.260]  openness as an open society and the fact that we have deference and we have
[01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:16.180]  tolerance and we have hospitality and because me let me tell you something you
[01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:21.440]  go to China gay people homosexuals are killed in China are put in forced
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:27.600]  labor you you do any of that they arrest you but here where it's all openly
[01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:32.400]  accepted well we better let drag queens talk to two-year-olds in preschool and
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:35.640]  tell them they're another sex their own parents would be perverts if they did
[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:40.120]  that if someone at a park did it they'd be arrested but if you're two-year-old
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:43.680]  you're three-year-old your four-year-old your five-year-old is talked to by some
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:49.800]  person in a dragon outfit or a vampire outfit literally telling them about
[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:55.800]  their sex well it's okay because we're all open and we're nice here this is all
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:24:05.640]  the giant white flag that the system runs up so I was gonna play a bunch of
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:10.960]  clips here and you know I've just gotten lost in the in the fog here what was the
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:14.600]  clip we're about to play I've got so much to cover but the talk of my ear what
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:20.800]  was it I was about to hit oh yeah oh yeah Emma
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:27.800]  Vigeland Vigeland I don't pay a lot of attention to media period I try to
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:31.000]  cover what's happening legislatively but I remember when I got kicked off
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.160]  YouTube Facebook Twitter five months ago like a million years ago she was like
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:38.600]  well Jones has been taken off the internet but it's really a right-wing
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:45.000]  plot take everybody off total made-up crap but then I saw this new video like
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.460]  a week ago and I forgot about it but I told the producer make me cover it
[01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:54.440]  because she works for the anti-christian genocidal group I mean that's that's
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:58.280]  what young Turks means she may not know it she works for the George Soros
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:06.280]  Qatar dictatorship funded young Turks so I saw this video that said Alex Jones
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:10.800]  in info wars admits they're fake can we put the name of the video on screen for
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:15.120]  folks I'm paraphrasing I'm going for memory so she she does this whole video
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:22.000]  and then she never shows text she never shows a video she never shows an audio
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:32.200]  she goes well Jones's lawyers admit he's fake and then she never shows where
[01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:37.400]  they said it or Roger Stone admits he published fake news and info wars none
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:48.320]  of that's even true but Roger Stone got sued separately from me by a man named
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:55.720]  Kwok whose stone had said had been indicted in China which I believe he
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:59.280]  has been but I had nothing to do with it and then as part of the settlement of
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:02.520]  the lawsuit that I guess it's Steve Bannon him engineered he just had to say
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:07.080]  that that was incorrect but the other information was accurate so that turns
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:12.560]  into Jones admits info wars is fake yeah there's a headline it was in
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:15.920]  thousands of publications
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.720]  meanwhile that was separate from info wars that wasn't even info war
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:25.280]  statements but it doesn't matter it's that headline info wars admits they're
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:29.760]  fake did she call me for comment no did she have me on the show no in fact I've
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:34.920]  been challenging her for a week to come on the show because the young turds are
[01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:39.280]  exposed as Qatar dictatorship operatives and Hillary Clinton but boys
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:44.560]  because that they've hired all these little internet people like her that
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:47.920]  could have been big on their own that even six months ago we're saying it's
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:54.800]  wrong to censor Alex Jones but now she works for sink Booger and he knows how
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:59.440]  to run an operation and so now when we come back from break I'm gonna put the
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:06.600]  clip which is not about me it's about lies where she says Jones admits they
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:11.800]  published fake news you know what really happened now like two and a half years
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:17.920]  ago was my ex-wife got lovers I have the kids full-time mainstream media says I
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:24.840]  don't that's again farther deception they get up on the news and they say
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:28.400]  Jones says he's an actor where's the clip where's the transcript oh they
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:33.120]  don't show that my lawyer Randall Wilhite whose name is on the family law code
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:38.800]  UT professor best family law guy in Texas they're trying to introduce 10-year-old
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:44.640]  video of me dressed up in Joker white paint saying drink your fluoride kids get
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:49.760]  sterile it's good it's telling kids fluorides bad and showing Harvard
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:54.400]  studies I'm not actually saying fluorides good anybody can tell that they
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:28:01.040]  need two percent of the time I do satire and then they run with it and my
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:05.960]  lawyer gets up and he goes this is an admissible mr. Jones is like when Jack
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:10.040]  Nicholson plays the Joker and Batman mr. Jones is being an actor to illustrate
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:16.800]  satire that turns into Jones admits everything he says is fake now now
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:20.760]  who's the fake news it's corporate media so here she is posing as the super
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:26.280]  liberal trendy super sexy awesome saying that and then she goes further
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:34.440]  after I'm banned from YouTube so I can't respond and says that Roger Stone
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:41.560]  admits it's all fake but she doesn't show you any text or any articles because
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:48.200]  the real fake person is the young Turks and their minions young Turks killed
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:52.680]  over a million and a half Christians the head of the young Turks denies it of
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:55.280]  course he does
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:29:01.520]  for those of us that are the tip of the spear we're being targeted to take out

[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:05.440]  central. Okay you know I almost don't want to even give this young Turk George
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:11.880]  Soros funded creature any attention but she wants it she needs to get it. She's
[01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:17.760]  a fraud and in the spectrum of folks I'm thinking about so and I've seen a few as
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:22.760]  everybody knows I have to for my good name she's definitely in the running but
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:26.760]  they're not getting money from Gulf War dictators they're you know picking up
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:31.400]  every every person they can on the internet and this young lady puts out
[01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:35.880]  constant videos lying about us but never has this on never shows a clip she'll
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:44.600]  just show some fake news headline her name is Emma Vigland and she says that
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:50.760]  and I'm gonna get the huge news on Kevin Spacey she says I admit I'm fake I'm a
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:57.480]  fraud Roger Stonemitz is a fraud that's it came over it's like saying she had
[01:34:57.480 --> 01:35:01.040]  met she's a child molester whether she kidnaps kids and you know cuts their
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:05.080]  livers out she didn't say that she didn't do that but doesn't matter if I if I was
[01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:11.080]  gonna say she was doing that I would show it but see she's a fraud she works
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:16.040]  for the Armenian Genocide Club now I mean that's what young Turk stand for
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:20.920]  they they say it never happened these are some the they get Gulf War state
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:28.240]  dictator money that's who they are and so she's there saying that I'm this
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:36.600]  existential fraud and that I admit I'm a fraud but not showing you again when I
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:40.360]  dress up like a Joker I'm playing the part not when I'm on the air it's very
[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:45.320]  clear when Roger Stone settles a lawsuit over one specific fact that he
[01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:50.080]  admits isn't exactly right how does it become me that admits I'm a fraud and
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:53.920]  I'm a criminal mainstream news does retractions and corrections every day
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:58.880]  but they think you're stupid so they make this huge event and this woman sits
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:04.720]  there and engages in fraud in my view against you and your family so let's
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:08.960]  go ahead and go to her young Turk report you know they sheep dip it they don't
[01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:14.800]  tell you they run the show but they do so here's here she is go ahead we hear a
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:18.600]  lot of talk of fake news from the president and from his followers I'm
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:24.040]  not gonna give you a question you are fake news and the fake news refused to
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:28.760]  call it right I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news it's
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:34.960]  fake phony fake fake news and we solve a lot of problems but what blows my mind
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:38.520]  is that it's complete projection right wing news is the fakest of them all
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:43.120]  studies have shown that Fox News viewers are consistently the most about
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:48.840]  world events studies pause studies have shown she's just reading some George
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:58.160]  Soros deal I'm a libertarian but she's just saying all this this is Mrs.
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:02.720]  Antifree speech on the young turds network so let's go back to turd gobbler
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:06.280]  go ahead we're literally being brainwashed to the point that researchers
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:10.520]  have dubbed the results the Fox News effect you know what I actually don't
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:14.800]  care what the New York Post says your times your time your times Washington
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:21.640]  Post CNN MSNBC CBS ABC because they're all fake the only channel I watch is
[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:28.280]  Fox and it's on 24-7 I haven't had my dogs watching Fox but while Fox News is
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:32.120]  the propaganda arm of the Republican Party and is incredibly effective in
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:36.040]  its reach it's mostly targeted towards old people I mean the median Fox viewer

[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:16.200]  actually gotten people to buy in even having Donald Trump the president of the
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:20.240]  United States on their program info wars has spread that the government

[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.360]  spread that the government controls the weather that Bill Gates is trying to
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:40:00.920]  commit genocide on minorities that Hillary Clinton was running a child sex
[01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:08.520]  ring out of a pizza parlor which we covered the fact that poor people whether

[01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:35.160]  to her right-wing terrorist to shoot up the place but perhaps most notoriously
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:39.000]  info wars has spread the idea that the parents of the victims of the Sandy
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:44.000]  Hook massacre where children were slaughtered are actors playing a hit
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:48.200]  pause again there's another headline the general internet did not buy anomalies
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:51.560]  years into it I said I thought it happened but she just keeps reupping
[01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:54.520]  because they think well if we say he's against children that'll make us look
[01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:58.760]  good continue those parents have had to change their addresses because of
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:03.160]  harassment but after all of that after all of the earth that info wars has
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:07.480]  scorched now that there's lawsuits and fear of their precious money being
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:11.800]  taken away Roger Stone top Republican strategist who worked with info wars
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:16.760]  and also worked for Donald Trump has admitted that info wars lies knowingly
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:20.840]  former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone settled a defamation suit seeking
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:24.560]  $100 million in damages on Monday for publishing false and misleading
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:28.920]  statements on info wars calm a far-right website known for promoting
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:33.080]  conspiracy that's Wall Street Journal you don't seem in quotes around that
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:37.280]  those are just words they took out none of that was even said and this is real
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:42.360]  fraud continue yeah that $100 million figure probably changed his tune and
[01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:46.240]  this isn't the first time an info wars operative has admitted it's all an act
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:50.200]  through the legal troubles Alex Jones's lawyer said he was just playing a
[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:54.480]  character in his custody battle with his ex-wife so who's the fake news now
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:58.480]  Roger Stone has admitted in court that he is a liar
[01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:03.280]  Alex Jones has admitted in court that he's an actor playing nodded tart and yet
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:07.200]  it won't matter to Trump supporters or info wars fans why because these
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:10.760]  Republican propaganda artists have been so effective in muddying the waters
[01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:14.560]  that no one knows what is truth anymore and ironically the same people who
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:19.320]  scream facts over feelings to those who possess empathy are the same ones who
[01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:24.920]  follow proven admitted liars why because it makes them feel good facts over
[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:30.060]  feeling well somebody's in love with the young turd leader God Almighty is she
[01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:34.840]  ready to sell out the system you got a job with George Soros sweetheart you

[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:05.800]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:22.840]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:59.160]  so in the last week or so it's come out that Kevin Spacey released a YouTube
[01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:04.360]  video saying you really miss me you want me back and that he was making threats
[01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:08.640]  the establishment saying do you want to really go here and I've been really
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:14.520]  busy I knew that Kevin Spacey document cam shot police for TV viewers had had
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:18.920]  flown on Jeffrey Epstein's pedophile plane with Bill Clinton many many times
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:23.920]  and I knew that he was a high-level globalist who hung out with the Queen
[01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:28.000]  of England and Prince Charles and men you don't get in their club unless you're
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:34.080]  a pedophile just like the Pope this is a vampiric group of your radio listener
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:38.400]  we're showing mainstream news headlines about the pedophilia so I think Kevin
[01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:44.800]  Spacey is a fricking dirtbag but Robert Mueller on record protected Jeffrey
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:49.600]  Epstein for a decade as an informant for the Clinton run FBI setting men up
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:53.040]  with underage girls that's mainstream news if you're a radio listener you've
[01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:58.720]  got Bureau of Investigation documents on-screen when I expose this media he
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:03.640]  goes Joan says Mueller is a child molester and blah blah no I'm saying he
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:12.280]  covers up for him so again if you're a TV viewer you can see all this but you've
[01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:17.760]  got the five-minute Kevin Spacey video coming out after Nantucket and he
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:23.360]  gropes on reportedly some 23 year old who really was 18 years old but the
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:30.600]  issue here is this is how they're using blackmail to control people and a good
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:34.760]  boil down to this is from question everything on YouTube channel Kevin
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:39.320]  Spacey's threatening the elitist and I went and looked where he says you know
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:42.960]  I'm coming after you if you keep doing this he drinks a cup the Queen of England
[01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:46.440]  gave him saying she was pledged to him and he's been involved I know with the
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:52.800]  Royals who are obsessed with pedophilia so and there's the whole background on
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:57.560]  that I mean it is it is confirmed that's how they control people so this
[01:49:57.560 --> 01:50:01.440]  nightmare situation goes from bad to worse so let's play a little bit of his
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:05.800]  creepy statement last week and then let's go to part of this report from
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:13.960]  question everything here it is and besides I know what you want you want
[01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:18.760]  me back of course some believed everything and I've just been waiting
[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:23.000]  with baited breath to hear me confess it all they're just dying to have me
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:28.200]  declare that everything said is true and that I got what I deserved wouldn't
[01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:34.000]  that be easy if it was all so simple only you and I both know it's never that
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:38.560]  simple not in politics and not in life but you wouldn't believe the worst without
[01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:44.840]  evidence would you you wouldn't rush to judgments without facts would you did
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:53.080]  you know not you you're smarter that's part of the five minute video that's
[01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:56.040]  been everywhere but I held back I wanted to research it before I made
[01:50:56.040 --> 01:50:59.240]  statements and everybody was like oh my god it's threats the elite look out
[01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:03.400]  blah blah and then I saw the coffee cup given to him five years ago by the
[01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:07.640]  Queen of England and we field each other and he says hey you better watch out
[01:51:07.640 --> 01:51:12.320]  you're all go down if I go down this next video from question everything we're
[01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:15.800]  gonna play part of it right now really illustrates this because listen he's on
[01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:19.280]  planes with Jeffrey Epstein he's on planes the Bill Clinton he's involved
[01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:25.600]  with Jerry you know I mean I mean not just Epstein but all the other big
[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:31.280]  people that are in the news that have been caught raping women molesting women
[01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:42.080]  attacking women and others so let's go and go this report here it is a lot now
[01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:47.520]  most of the insinuations are difficult to follow however once I saw the cup he
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:53.000]  was holding it all kicked into place the cup has the royal crest on it and
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:58.520]  states throughout all my life and with all my heart I shall strive to be worthy
[01:51:58.520 --> 01:52:04.920]  of your trust Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the second follow me down this
[01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:10.040]  rabbit hole because I think it will leave you satisfied and I believe that I
[01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:15.400]  will prove that this video was anything but a desperate plea to get his job back
[01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:20.160]  take a look at the flight log from Jeffrey Epstein's plane the disgusting
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:26.240]  pedophile plane dubbed the Lolita Express it will see that Kevin Spacey flew
[01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:33.240]  with Bill Clinton on four occasions and then again you've got Harvey Weinstein
[01:52:33.240 --> 01:52:37.680]  on the same aircraft flights to these pedophile islands and you've got Kevin
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:41.680]  Spacey hanging out with Prince Charles and the Queen of England all of them
[01:52:41.680 --> 01:52:47.480]  when the Queen of England shunned not Prince Charles but the other one is on
[01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:56.640]  the airplane with Andrew is on Prince Andrew is on the airplane with Kevin
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:53:00.920]  Spacey and Bill Clinton Harvey Weinstein I mean these are a bunch of
[01:53:00.920 --> 01:53:08.320]  psychotic jerks and then he's begging for help on television he's saying help me
[01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:14.240]  here's my cup you gave me you love me your son is on the plane with me
[01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:20.400]  Bill Clinton's on the plane with me Harvey Weinstein's on why are you
[01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:27.600]  doing this and if you're a radio listener we're putting mainstream news
[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:32.480]  articles on screen showing all this I wouldn't say this if it wasn't already
[01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:40.640]  the news but I will connect the dots and now Steve Bannon repeatedly meets
[01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:44.920]  Jeffrey Epstein I learned Stephen Bannon's main mission is to take down
[01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:49.680]  Info Wars around the clock he's been tasked by the Clintons to take us down
[01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:53.960]  why because we will cover this this isn't somebody boasting here you've seen
[01:53:53.960 --> 01:54:03.240]  how we're under attack no one dares stand up for the children no one and you
[01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:08.480]  know I'm not looking for a fight but you know what I am on the side of the
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:17.160]  children and so I'll do whatever I have to do but if you're a radio listener
[01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:21.600]  you're missing out the video feeds which are at infowars.com forward slash show
[01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:25.640]  and I'm not trying to take radio listeners away from the radio stations
[01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:29.040]  I'm trying to survive here I'm trying to tell people if you're a listener I'm
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:34.400]  not just saying this they misrepresent who we are and what we say and what we
[01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:43.640]  stand for because they hate our guts and it's only the listeners it's only the
[01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:47.600]  viewers who can get around the Facebook and the YouTube and the Google
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:51.640]  sensors all these compromised pedophiles they've put in charge those
[01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:58.160]  companies oh my god only you can buy word of mouth say go to news wars.com go
[01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:02.120]  to m4wars.com only you can say go to that local radio station go to that
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:07.400]  local TV station only you can do it I'm not worried about me I'm worried I'm
[01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:12.160]  not strong enough to carry the ball down the field to beat these people but if
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:17.640]  you ever really realize the power you've got and you really take action it's over
[01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:21.920]  I mean you've done that to a great extent and that's why they hate infowars
[01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:29.240]  because we're dialed in to awake involved people I have no desire to be on
[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:33.800]  board some aircraft screwing 10-year-old girls or boys in fact I'd kill not to do
[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:44.520]  it but when you look at the weird soft demonic faces all satisfied of Kevin
[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:49.080]  Spacey and Bill Clinton and Harvey Weinstein and Hillary Clinton who
[01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:53.760]  famously represented pedophiles which you got out of college and you just
[01:55:53.760 --> 01:56:01.200]  realize oh my god we found the bottom of the barrel we found the most soulless
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:12.000]  people the planets ever seen and I don't fear what they'll do to me I fear if I
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:20.480]  don't fight them hard enough I might be seen by God as being with them you see
[01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:30.000]  I fear not absolutely doing everything I can to wreak havoc against their
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:39.400]  operations and be as strong as I can to defeat them and that's the answer to
[01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:47.120]  this question because in the universe God doesn't even care about outcomes as
[01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:55.120]  much as God cares about decisions and everyone must make the decision to stand
[01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:59.800]  against these vampires that feed on the very souls of children now this
[01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:04.800]  broadcast is gonna end in 45 seconds and then it's gonna go to counter think of
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:09.640]  the special hour production by Mike Adams that everyone should see and then
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:13.200]  Lord willing David I'll be alive tomorrow he's having surgery and I would
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:18.360]  sure today I'm gonna be covering about whatever you do realize that in time and
[01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:26.040]  space your action and your will and your spreading the word is unstoppable
[01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:31.760]  you're like the wind in the sails of humanity's spirit humanity's destiny
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:38.720]  and that's where we are right now everything else is a joke all that
[01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:42.320]  matters is the test we now face want to thank the crew want to think of yours
[01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:46.520]  the transmission is now over
[01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:54.920]  we need to go back and revisit foundations of our freedom our freedoms
[01:57:54.920 --> 01:57:57.640]  don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper it
[01:57:57.640 --> 01:58:01.200]  consists of the things that we're willing to fight for the First Amendment the
[01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:04.640]  Bill of Rights the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions they're
[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:09.280]  prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:13.080]  those God-given rights from us as individuals you better understand that
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:19.840]  because they're taking them right now we have seen what they want to do they
[01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:23.920]  called it you an agent 21 now they call it the UN 20 30 agenda they want
[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:28.280]  everybody off of the rural lands they want people out of the suburbs they
[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:33.000]  want to pack everybody into the cities because that's where it is easiest for
[01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:39.240]  them to control everyone it's the David night show never missed your show any
