[00:00.000 --> 00:11.640]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.640 --> 00:19.200]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.200 --> 00:23.240]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:23.240 --> 00:32.240]  ladies and gentlemen it is Monday the 23rd day of July 2012 we're gonna be live
[00:32.240 --> 00:36.240]  here for the next three hours breaking down all of the amazing developments
[00:36.240 --> 00:44.060]  unfolding worldwide yesterday we posted a Lou Rockwell article that's now in the
[00:44.060 --> 00:49.480]  featured archive of info wars.com or just click on the top stories link at
[00:49.480 --> 00:55.680]  the top of info wars.com dealing with the other post Colorado shooting rampage
[00:55.680 --> 01:01.440]  and the police had shot a citizen the neighborhood came out and was saying you
[01:01.440 --> 01:05.240]  know angrily why'd you do this so the police open fire on them with rubber
[01:05.240 --> 01:10.320]  bullets that can kill you at close range and the footage because I hadn't watched
[01:10.320 --> 01:15.400]  it until this morning I just saw the article in reddit has police releasing
[01:15.400 --> 01:21.640]  police dogs on women with babies in their arms and baby strollers and walking up
[01:21.640 --> 01:27.920]  and shotgunning and I've seen this in Portland Oregon they had an anti-war
[01:27.920 --> 01:31.480]  demonstration the police kettled it it was peaceful and attacked it and they
[01:31.480 --> 01:34.560]  come over to the baby in a baby carriage that's like the favorite thing to target
[01:34.560 --> 01:37.720]  and spray the babies in the face and the mother's like why are you doing that
[01:37.720 --> 01:42.600]  and says we should bring a baby to a protest so this is the type of just
[01:42.600 --> 01:52.200]  insanity that we see going on in some areas of this country. Now in the
[01:52.200 --> 01:56.160]  aftermath of the shooting
[01:57.440 --> 02:03.200]  there in Colorado we've seen all the surrogates of Obama come out and call
[02:03.200 --> 02:07.160]  for restrictions of the Second Amendment but now Obama himself is
[02:07.160 --> 02:10.320]  suggesting he's not going to go after your guns and the council on foreign
[02:10.320 --> 02:12.680]  relations came out with a report yesterday curtain Emma wrote about it
[02:12.680 --> 02:16.160]  saying look this treaty won't restrict your guns go back to sleep kind of like
[02:16.160 --> 02:20.640]  Obama won't sign the NDAA he won't hire any lobbyist you know he won't do this
[02:20.640 --> 02:26.120]  in that but then he did that's their standard tactic is to get people into a
[02:26.120 --> 02:30.240]  false sense of security and then come after your rights they want to get this
[02:30.240 --> 02:35.160]  treaty through because it does shine us under UN law but they want to just later
[02:35.160 --> 02:38.920]  implement it it's kind of like Obama said yeah I signed the NDAA but I won't
[02:38.920 --> 02:45.800]  implement it maybe so we've got all that happening also we've got another
[02:45.800 --> 02:51.920]  article posted up at info wars.com that video that happened early last week or
[02:51.920 --> 02:55.360]  the video got released early last week it happened a few weeks ago with the
[02:55.360 --> 02:59.720]  people in the internet cafe and the two guys coming with masks and guns to rob
[02:59.720 --> 03:04.960]  them and an old man gets up with a 25 cowl and starts with precision knowing
[03:04.960 --> 03:09.000]  what he's doing shooting them they turn tail and run and he chases them out the
[03:09.000 --> 03:18.320]  door and of course that article that you need to circulate to everybody is up
[03:18.320 --> 03:25.120]  at info wars.com so please please get it out to everybody like I'm looking for
[03:25.120 --> 03:29.800]  the exact headline yeah it's in featured news down towards the bottom how to stop
[03:29.800 --> 03:35.760]  a massacre surveillance video reveals simple low-cost solution that works
[03:35.760 --> 03:41.080]  everywhere and you know we don't I don't sit there and make everybody that
[03:41.080 --> 03:45.120]  writes for our websites info wars.com prisonbunner.com or even who we post
[03:45.120 --> 03:48.880]  totally agree with us there's also articles going with the perspective that
[03:48.880 --> 03:52.960]  he was on a bunch of psychotropic drugs there's also a bunch of articles about
[03:52.960 --> 03:56.600]  20 more examples of sickos that are overrunning America because there are a
[03:56.600 --> 04:00.200]  lot of people in denialism and death and murder even the London Telegraph has
[04:00.200 --> 04:04.040]  written about that that it's it's the video games the movies a normal person
[04:04.040 --> 04:09.240]  doesn't make them go crazy but sickos this is how they become a man just like
[04:09.240 --> 04:14.600]  in all ancient cultures young men in around 1213 wanted to go join and go on
[04:14.600 --> 04:19.280]  raiding parties or go you know to war because that's how you became a man
[04:19.280 --> 04:24.800]  I remember when I was 1213 14 and you know I I believed all the stories with
[04:24.800 --> 04:27.800]  the other kids claiming they had all these girlfriends and I believe
[04:27.800 --> 04:31.440]  everybody's stories about how tough they were and so I wanted to become that
[04:31.440 --> 04:36.600]  and and and that's just a normal male activity but but now they say if you're
[04:36.600 --> 04:40.960]  a really cool male you get all into death and you go and shoot a bunch of
[04:40.960 --> 04:45.080]  people there's all this weird art now or good-looking women do mean things to
[04:45.080 --> 04:52.800]  animals very sick but my gut tells me this is a black off and I'm gonna break

[05:17.080 --> 05:21.440]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[05:21.440 --> 05:25.720]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new

[08:30.920 --> 08:36.320]  Emory and Holland Bender Neuenhoff both filmmakers and experts on false flag
[08:36.320 --> 08:41.280]  terror joining us in the third hour today and the reason they're joining us
[08:41.280 --> 08:49.320]  is they looked at a specific stage terror attack in 1995 run by the very same
[08:49.320 --> 08:54.040]  crew I believe from the evidence and the earmarks and the signatures and the
[08:54.040 --> 09:01.680]  wavelength and the PR push the prime suspects of this new shooting in Colorado
[09:01.680 --> 09:06.320]  are the same people that committed the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 on April
[09:06.320 --> 09:10.760]  19th and by the way that's open and shut I've interviewed the police the
[09:10.760 --> 09:16.080]  workers the head of the of of HUD I've interviewed them all except well those
[09:16.080 --> 09:19.480]  they killed they killed some of the medical people and at least one police
[09:19.480 --> 09:25.520]  officer that saw the ATF and the dirty deeds they were committing you know the
[09:25.520 --> 09:28.760]  same ATF the ships guns to Mexico to blame the Second Amendment and then the
[09:28.760 --> 09:33.480]  memos come out it was a false flag you know 2,000 dead of the almost 60,000
[09:33.480 --> 09:38.400]  dead now the last three and a half four years in Mexico hundreds dead in the US
[09:38.400 --> 09:43.280]  those are very conservative numbers multiple border patrol multiple police
[09:43.280 --> 09:50.840]  doing it all to blame the Second Amendment oh but we shouldn't look at
[09:50.840 --> 09:56.400]  this same crew for the shooting here how do you do it you hop somebody up on
[09:56.400 --> 10:01.960]  drugs shock therapy psychotropic only takes a few months to do this with a
[10:01.960 --> 10:06.280]  person that's already has a proclivity towards hot being suggestible and you
[10:06.280 --> 10:11.960]  basically chemically hypnotize them with devil's breath cocktails a PCP LSD
[10:11.960 --> 10:16.840]  masculine oh that's what was in the bodies of the Mumbai massacre people
[10:16.840 --> 10:20.600]  remember three years ago the attacks in India I went on air and said it's an
[10:20.600 --> 10:25.720]  inside job oh by the way the head of Indian intelligence who was killed that
[10:25.720 --> 10:29.040]  day fighting them shed its Western intelligence trying to get a war between
[10:29.040 --> 10:33.000]  India and Pakistan he was killed that day by the way he was a Hindu not a
[10:33.000 --> 10:36.160]  Muslim they want to get India and Pakistan fighting with each other and
[10:36.160 --> 10:40.040]  then what came out months later in the Chicago Tribune I covered this yesterday
[10:40.040 --> 10:47.320]  oh that a CIA agent led and trained the attacks and then when they finally killed
[10:47.320 --> 10:53.320]  the was it five or six guys you notice they weren't in Muslim Guard they did
[10:53.320 --> 10:56.680]  what didn't have beards they look totally crazy when I saw that surveillance
[10:56.680 --> 11:01.840]  camera footage the day after I said those people were on LSD PCP masculine
[11:01.840 --> 11:06.080]  devil's breath concoctions because I mean I've got MK ultra I know what they
[11:06.080 --> 11:12.520]  give people you know what they found injectors of PCP at LSD injectors
[11:12.520 --> 11:20.440]  commandos land at night on boats on PCP LSD and stuff like that and are we're
[11:20.440 --> 11:26.160]  injecting it into their veins do you have any idea what that does your normal
[11:26.160 --> 11:30.360]  person a normal person who hasn't been on it for a long period of time cannot get
[11:30.360 --> 11:36.600]  up and walk in the 50s and 60s they did it for psychological testing MK ultra at
[11:36.600 --> 11:39.840]  every major university including University of Texas down the street from
[11:39.840 --> 11:45.120]  me that's declassified where they would bring in college neuroscience or
[11:45.120 --> 11:49.840]  psychology students and they would inject them with pure LSD and then try to
[11:49.840 --> 11:55.040]  program them convince them they were somebody else screw them all up I mean
[11:55.040 --> 11:59.560]  we're talking about mega doses of this and the only way these guys could be
[11:59.560 --> 12:04.320]  injecting LSD PCP and other hallucinogens at the Mumbai attack was if
[12:04.320 --> 12:08.000]  they'd been on it for six months or longer folks they'd been strapped down
[12:08.000 --> 12:13.960]  with headsets and total programming electro shop probably for a year and then
[12:13.960 --> 12:17.600]  it was like okay ready now all the pain is gonna end you're gonna win you're
[12:17.600 --> 12:21.240]  gonna find the you're gonna find the you know the purple monkey and you know
[12:21.240 --> 12:24.440]  whatever weird programming word they use catcher in the rye was an earlier
[12:24.440 --> 12:28.280]  program you know a lot of shooters were under and they just are it creates an
[12:28.280 --> 12:33.320]  artificial total obsessive-compulsive schizoid break and then they tell them
[12:33.320 --> 12:37.880]  aren't I and remember you want to keep this going for days so they inject them
[12:37.880 --> 12:41.480]  as they're coming into the beach they give them their backpacks they give them
[12:41.480 --> 12:46.480]  their team leader okay you ready for your mission and then they go out for two
[12:46.480 --> 12:50.880]  days and in hand-granating and rocket attack and machine gun attacks inside
[12:50.880 --> 12:55.760]  the shopping malls and then it came out in the news when they killed them
[12:55.760 --> 12:59.280]  there's their backpacks with all the injectables the Indian police they
[12:59.280 --> 13:03.000]  weren't playing ball they said we think you stage that that was in the times of
[13:03.000 --> 13:09.200]  India this is how they do it folks they could grab you off the street even if
[13:09.200 --> 13:13.400]  you were strong mentally and in six months they could have you doing anything
[13:13.400 --> 13:18.240]  they wanted including thinking you were a dog thinking you were John Wayne
[13:18.240 --> 13:23.440]  thinking you were the mad hatter from Alice in Wonderland they can do whatever
[13:23.440 --> 13:27.640]  they want they erase your memory of electro shock 24 hours a day they've
[13:27.640 --> 13:32.040]  got headsets on you with you in a tied down a straight jacket pumping audio in
[13:32.040 --> 13:36.000]  while they're injecting you if that doesn't break you they find your fear
[13:36.000 --> 13:41.480]  points a lot of times that's people running around in monster outfits while
[13:41.480 --> 13:46.560]  you're hallucinating or with the Muslims it's coming in and women having sex
[13:46.560 --> 13:51.400]  with them while pouring blood on them at at the CIA brainwashing base which is
[13:51.400 --> 13:54.760]  declassified partially they admit it's there they have a brainwashing
[13:54.760 --> 14:00.560]  laboratory to create mind control Muslim assassins to then blame on Muslims
[14:00.560 --> 14:05.620]  and also to command Al-Qaeda forces I mean you notice that the graduates of
[14:05.620 --> 14:10.160]  Camp X-ray they're the people commanding Libya attack commanding Syria attack
[14:10.160 --> 14:14.800]  commanding at all but but see I'm digressing into mind control here right
[14:14.800 --> 14:22.120]  now that's how this works and you notice he was a promising quote young
[14:22.120 --> 14:28.960]  scientist in his PhD level you notice that we did look it up it indeed you
[14:28.960 --> 14:31.880]  can go look it up I've got to get these articles written I do all the research
[14:31.880 --> 14:36.880]  never have time to even codify it was a Department of Defense funded Neurosciences
[14:36.880 --> 14:42.160]  laboratory funded out of Pennsylvania and out of the Air Force base nearby and
[14:42.160 --> 14:47.120]  he's in an advanced secretive program we have videos now but before he even
[14:47.120 --> 14:54.600]  finishes regular college degree talking about time gaps and again it's just so
[14:54.600 --> 14:58.660]  obvious this whole thing is just completely there Theodore Kaczynski the
[14:58.660 --> 15:04.840]  unabomber look it up Theodore Kaczynski the unabomber he was MK
[15:04.840 --> 15:10.480]  ultra I mean that's admitted that he was MK ultra and it was just a footnote in
[15:10.480 --> 15:16.440]  in in some of the college students that quote volunteered for the program
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.520]  captain Webb are you ready to commit to this program no matter what yes sir are
[15:22.520 --> 15:26.320]  you sure you're ready to commit to this program I warn you this program is
[15:26.320 --> 15:31.400]  unorthodox and highly classified are you ready to commit to this program yes sir
[15:31.400 --> 15:39.160]  I'm ready to commit to this program if you are in the military or any other
[15:39.160 --> 15:43.040]  group and they ever want you to volunteer for some kind of program and
[15:43.040 --> 15:46.480]  they tell you it's classified and it deals with drugs to enhance your ability
[15:46.480 --> 15:50.000]  which they admit they've been doing and but they won't tell you the details you
[15:50.000 --> 15:54.920]  do not do it do not do it because a lot of times they get you to volunteer and
[15:54.920 --> 15:58.840]  don't tell you by the way we're going to set you up as a patsy and send you to
[15:58.840 --> 16:02.880]  death row or send you to a mental institution
[16:02.880 --> 16:13.360]  you do not want to be part of this so the point is this is real this is going
[16:13.360 --> 16:17.320]  on this is happening every major government does it now now this could
[16:17.320 --> 16:24.240]  be mind control the point of he was the shooter that's harder to pull off okay
[16:24.240 --> 16:28.920]  they could get it to that level but that's normally it's just somebody
[16:28.920 --> 16:33.000]  whacked out of their mind who is programmed probably being shown you know
[16:33.000 --> 16:37.800]  the Joker scenes five thousand times while brain probes are any many's on a
[16:37.800 --> 16:43.520]  cocktail of hallucinogens flying a magic carpet and then now he just thinks he's
[16:43.520 --> 16:47.800]  the Joker and will foam at the mouth for the rest of his life and say yes I did
[16:47.800 --> 16:51.600]  it yes I did it they'll get him drugged up have the army doctors come in they'll
[16:51.600 --> 16:55.120]  even use the doctors that programmed him it'll be oh a former top mind control
[16:55.120 --> 17:00.160]  scientist is the court-appointed doctor for Mr. Holmes you know that's no big
[17:00.160 --> 17:05.960]  deal no big deal nothing to worry about oh never mind mr. Gover is this you know
[17:05.960 --> 17:09.840]  some friends of mr. Rabbit mr. No but it's a plastic explosive nothing to worry
[17:09.840 --> 17:13.680]  about that's a quote from Caddyshack he's dropping them in there they'll have
[17:13.680 --> 17:20.640]  literally make they had Jolly and West the protoge of Dr. Ewan Cameron the
[17:20.640 --> 17:25.360]  worldwide most famous mind control doctor that kidnapped thousands of children
[17:25.360 --> 17:30.800]  military personnel you name it and totally programmed them with the LSD PCP
[17:30.800 --> 17:35.680]  electro shock and all of it now they just use brain probes and chips 20 years
[17:35.680 --> 17:40.320]  ago had a remote control roaches remote control rats where the rat stops walks
[17:40.320 --> 17:44.600]  gets upon its hind legs bites so you can send them into rubble or whatever you
[17:44.600 --> 17:48.320]  see rubble rats they've got a chip in their brain you know move out and for
[17:48.320 --> 17:51.560]  decades they send them into rubble and stuff special forces have got them now
[17:51.560 --> 17:55.640]  drop them out send them into cities they've got rubble rats built where one
[17:55.640 --> 18:00.640]  of their eyes has been removed and one eye as a camera well that's highly
[18:00.640 --> 18:05.960]  classified right there they for at least 20 years have cybernetic dolphins with
[18:05.960 --> 18:12.880]  brain interfaces if you go around with surveillance equipment or plant mines on
[18:12.880 --> 18:18.920]  things but they're segueing away from biological weapon systems to C drones
[18:18.920 --> 18:24.120]  air drones ground drones combat mechs of every type because you're in the 21st
[18:24.120 --> 18:28.880]  century it's 2012 steaming right into 2013 ladies and gentlemen the
[18:28.880 --> 18:34.120]  technology we know about is 30 years old at least you're not in Kansas anymore
[18:34.120 --> 18:41.640]  ladies and gentlemen and this brain program was so classified you know most
[18:41.640 --> 18:45.480]  these universities have DARPA funding what you see the labs the stuff that
[18:45.480 --> 18:49.280]  people are being taught that's just a farming program to see who will do what
[18:49.280 --> 18:53.400]  they're told to assess you for the PhD programs and then when you get into the
[18:53.400 --> 18:58.160]  restrict I've only seen restricted programs at the University of Texas and
[18:58.160 --> 19:01.400]  I wasn't even supposed to see that and let me tell you ladies and gentlemen it's
[19:01.400 --> 19:08.360]  science fiction you hit one button and you're looking at the monkey farm and
[19:08.360 --> 19:11.600]  those monkeys have got those wires hooked into their brains Department of
[19:11.600 --> 19:15.920]  Defense and they're studying how to flicker that TV screen just right to put
[19:15.920 --> 19:21.000]  you into a trance to then program you and then they've got other programs where
[19:21.000 --> 19:24.440]  it's above ground where oh they can then get the graduate students and
[19:24.440 --> 19:28.720]  psychological volunteers women to come in and they have a flicker rate and they
[19:28.720 --> 19:32.960]  do a flicker rate in one lab how do you sexually arouse a woman they've got
[19:32.960 --> 19:36.840]  another one how do you make somebody hungry you go to another lab it's a
[19:36.840 --> 19:39.600]  retina scanner that tracks you from a hundred yards away that you don't even
[19:39.600 --> 19:46.240]  know is there or you go to another lab it's a molecular scanner I saw that 12
[19:46.240 --> 19:52.000]  years ago University of Texas and most of this I was allowed to see I accidentally
[19:52.000 --> 19:58.080]  we accidentally some computer screens got left up and some things and I did
[19:58.080 --> 20:02.400]  see some things well they're right back let me ask you a question what does

[24:14.520 --> 24:23.360]  frustrating for me I have watched the old black and white MK ultra hearings
[24:23.360 --> 24:30.960]  they're online I have read the documents I have interviewed people who were
[24:30.960 --> 24:38.960]  victims of this famous people who had family members killed by operatives
[24:38.960 --> 24:44.720]  undermined control privately interviewed not on air I'm just gonna leave it at
[24:44.720 --> 24:51.080]  that I have read the police files and the corner files from Sirhan Sirhan who
[24:51.080 --> 24:55.160]  shot RFK we were told but the police said he wasn't wasn't the same caliber
[24:55.160 --> 25:00.680]  his gun was held down it was the security detail with Robert Kennedy I know
[25:00.680 --> 25:07.360]  this stuff's real just like drug gangs in South America and Central America give
[25:07.360 --> 25:14.560]  people tiny dosages of scopolamine out of devil's breath plant and they can
[25:14.560 --> 25:20.760]  drive a car perfectly they can do mathematics they can you know they're
[25:20.760 --> 25:28.120]  not impaired except they have no free will it's basically truth serum when
[25:28.120 --> 25:32.120]  you're on truth serum scopolamine folks and they've got some other drugs they
[25:32.120 --> 25:37.280]  can mix in with they're even more advanced it's it's not that you just tell
[25:37.280 --> 25:43.760]  the truth you do whatever you're told you do whatever you're told and then the
[25:43.760 --> 25:47.200]  naive public it's kind of like weather engineering has been going around
[25:47.200 --> 25:51.760]  happening for over a hundred years high-tech the last 30 we told you about
[25:51.760 --> 25:56.800]  Stanford Research Institute all of it certifying they could control hurricanes
[25:56.800 --> 26:02.280]  and create them and kill them back in 1967 it was already certified I covered
[26:02.280 --> 26:05.400]  this one it was still classified
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.520]  and it's so frustrating to then again you know she comments going Alex Jones
[26:14.520 --> 26:19.200]  believes they can control the weather it's the same thing with mind control it's
[26:19.200 --> 26:23.920]  the same thing and I see it over and over again with Major Hassan with Theodore
[26:23.920 --> 26:29.760]  Kaczynski the the unabomber with James Holmes the brilliant PhD science
[26:29.760 --> 26:35.280]  student in a classified restricted program they always come out of these
[26:35.280 --> 26:39.160]  same programs because this is where they recruit them this is where they set
[26:39.160 --> 26:42.920]  them up again I'm going to say this if the government would stage fast and
[26:42.920 --> 26:45.920]  furious it's killed thousands conservatively to blame the Second
[26:45.920 --> 26:51.200]  Amendment if there are thousands of declassified instances of our tribes
[26:51.200 --> 26:56.120]  being given chemical biological and radiological dosages to kill them in
[26:56.120 --> 27:01.800]  many cases and the UN's caught shooting kids up with cancer viruses
[27:01.800 --> 27:08.080]  sterilants and live pathogens like polio and in the military for thousands of
[27:08.080 --> 27:13.160]  years you'll send in a small contingent of cavalry or ground forces to draw out
[27:13.160 --> 27:18.520]  the enemy knowing that thousands of your troops in some famous cases would all
[27:18.520 --> 27:22.400]  be killed so that you could draw the enemy out to where you wanted them to
[27:22.400 --> 27:27.160]  run a pincer attack against them in many cases I mean the military mind dish I'm
[27:27.160 --> 27:31.040]  going to kill a thousand of my best trips to draw out the enemy so that we
[27:31.040 --> 27:35.360]  don't lose this whole battle and lose 20,000
[27:35.680 --> 27:40.280]  see you're not thinking from an elitist perspective so you're like how could
[27:40.280 --> 27:43.480]  they go to that theater how could they have the witness to say multiple
[27:43.480 --> 27:47.800]  shooters tear gas canisters or smoke bombs from both sides from opposite
[27:47.800 --> 27:52.120]  directions you know somebody let him in know with somebody else and then the
[27:52.120 --> 27:56.760]  MO and the UN tree the motive coming up all of this there are real mass shootings
[27:56.760 --> 28:01.400]  when they happen they get almost no attention there have been real chemical
[28:01.400 --> 28:05.680]  plants blown up by real terrorists there are a lot of actually real events
[28:05.680 --> 28:09.520]  were crazy people and criminal groups and criminal groups shaking down
[28:09.520 --> 28:21.080]  companies and espionage espionage goes on all the time financial sabotage real
[28:21.080 --> 28:27.000]  terror attacks you don't hear about it's the fake ones you do because the
[28:27.000 --> 28:30.040]  globalists have a rule when they're not really doing something they don't want
[28:30.040 --> 28:32.520]  it to be discussed they don't want it to be a big deal you know there've been
[28:32.520 --> 28:36.440]  cases of whole police stations shot up and five six cops killed just the last
[28:36.440 --> 28:40.040]  year and a half you never hear about on the news matter footnote because they
[28:40.040 --> 28:47.520]  don't want real terror attacks being discussed but when they've got a big
[28:47.520 --> 28:51.440]  see again and the frustration is there's thousands of points here
[28:51.440 --> 28:56.600]  literally I want to get your take on this if you agree with me if you disagree
[28:56.600 --> 29:02.360]  I'm not I'm not saying that it was a staged event I'm saying my gut says
[29:02.360 --> 29:06.560]  that in all the evidence points in that direction I'm not saying you're bad if
[29:06.560 --> 29:09.560]  you think he was just on psychotropic drugs which is a form of mind control
[29:09.560 --> 29:13.880]  itself you take hallucinogenic drugs like he was taking over-the-counter not
[29:13.880 --> 29:17.840]  over-the-counter but prescription which are over-the-counter but not over-the-
[29:17.840 --> 29:23.080]  counter in the classic sense you take those it puts you into a suggestive
[29:23.080 --> 29:27.080]  state you play video games watch violent movies a certain percentage of people
[29:27.080 --> 29:32.120]  are gonna go cuckoo like Sergeant Bales over in Afghanistan he was on a bunch of
[29:32.120 --> 29:35.680]  those drugs oh here let's put you on a psychotropic that can make you go
[29:35.680 --> 29:40.280]  psychotic and then sin yeah yeah I mean that's a good idea so I mean we got
[29:40.280 --> 29:43.320]  articles up people saying that's what they think at info wars.com that's fine
[29:43.320 --> 29:50.240]  as for me this has all the earmarks of a very sophisticated black op we're on
[29:50.240 --> 29:58.480]  the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[33:33.760 --> 33:42.320]  13-year-old stepping front of a bullet for a smaller child we also have a video
[33:42.320 --> 33:47.320]  up at info wars.com how to stop a massacre surveillance video reveals

[33:51.960 --> 33:57.360]  Adams story out to everybody in fact I'm going to Twitter that out on our

[34:01.760 --> 34:09.400]  slash real Alex Jones we also are going to play the footage and analyze it here
[34:09.400 --> 34:14.240]  for radio listeners of Anaheim police go on rampage against citizens I saw the
[34:14.240 --> 34:21.040]  article yesterday by Lou Rockwell at info wars.com I didn't even watch the
[34:21.040 --> 34:26.040]  video until this morning and when you see police purposely with rubber bullets
[34:26.040 --> 34:30.360]  up close shot gunning women when they know it'll kill you kills a lot of
[34:30.360 --> 34:33.600]  people they've killed people you know that Red Sox game when they came out of
[34:33.600 --> 34:37.880]  the bar shot the woman in the face and they're shooting people with babies in
[34:37.880 --> 34:43.320]  their arms and coming up to baby carriages and shooting at them and it's
[34:43.320 --> 34:47.280]  it's really bizarre I've seen this a lot like in Pittsburgh the G20 when a
[34:47.280 --> 34:52.400]  woman to two older women come out of a store with shopping bags they would
[34:52.400 --> 34:55.680]  just randomly show up in Pittsburgh and say you're not allowed to be out during
[34:55.680 --> 34:59.480]  the daytime here just to just to crack some heads it was all a big drill to see
[34:59.480 --> 35:02.960]  what they could get cops to do and cops in Darth Vader outfits these clown
[35:02.960 --> 35:06.960]  outfits where I guess they hide who they are so they can act like the you know
[35:06.960 --> 35:11.040]  cowards I guess they you know they are release police dogs on old women and
[35:11.040 --> 35:14.080]  they're biting them and the cops are getting off on it I mean I just can't
[35:14.080 --> 35:17.480]  imagine wanting to go find some old women with shopping bags and release a
[35:17.480 --> 35:21.320]  police dog on them and then I'm not patriotic because I'm not into that I
[35:21.320 --> 35:26.040]  guess I'm not patriotic to the devil I mean I don't know what you say but the
[35:26.040 --> 35:32.240]  post Aurora rampage that nobody's heard about but the post Aurora rampage that
[35:32.240 --> 35:36.400]  few have heard about info wars.com from William Greg originally Rockwell.com
[35:36.400 --> 35:41.680]  the video is up there right now that is now in the featured news archive or just
[35:41.680 --> 35:49.440]  click top stories and it's in there now my head is spinning basically at this
[35:49.440 --> 35:59.240]  point I've got so much news I want to go over but I also want to get you on air I
[35:59.240 --> 36:02.480]  want to hear from listeners out there we're gonna do first-time callers today
[36:02.480 --> 36:06.640]  to get your take on any of the stuff in the news I mean just take the fact that
[36:06.640 --> 36:10.640]  we had a whistleblower on a month and a half ago and now everything he talked
[36:10.640 --> 36:17.840]  about has been confirmed TV producer over in England we get him on he's been
[36:17.840 --> 36:22.960]  working for a month for the big security firm he said they're not even doing
[36:22.960 --> 36:27.520]  basic checks and that they said at the end of the Olympics after they're over
[36:27.520 --> 36:33.160]  there'll be an event that changes our world forever and that the military was
[36:33.160 --> 36:37.480]  secretly being stationed in and around that area where they're having the
[36:37.480 --> 36:41.680]  Olympics over in England now it's admitted there's no security that's all
[36:41.680 --> 36:46.120]  over the British news it's admitted the military was secretly stationed and it's
[36:46.120 --> 36:51.000]  admitted that there's basically no security and now Israel says Iran is
[36:51.000 --> 36:56.120]  planning to attack the Olympics Iran is doing everything it can to not get
[36:56.120 --> 36:59.200]  attacked not saying Iran's perfect all these governments are corrupt the point
[36:59.200 --> 37:04.240]  is is jumping through all the hoops putting up with Western back commandos
[37:04.240 --> 37:09.760]  attacking their country that's on record destabilization actions so they're so
[37:09.760 --> 37:14.880]  they're now going to attack the Olympics via Hezbollah so that that they
[37:14.880 --> 37:19.000]  control which they do to a great extent so that they will get attacked and
[37:19.000 --> 37:30.840]  overthrown I mean that is just that'd be like saying I don't follow it enough but
[37:30.840 --> 37:37.240]  who's like the top heavyweight fighter in UFC right now I have no idea but I mean
[37:37.240 --> 37:47.680]  let's just say Mike Tyson in his prime in 1988 it'd be like saying I'm gonna go
[37:47.680 --> 37:55.880]  pick a fight with Mike Tyson right now maybe yes yes Israel says Iran is going
[37:55.880 --> 38:01.080]  to attack the Olympics I mean that is huge because all the different sources
[38:01.080 --> 38:04.240]  we've got say they are planning something big at the Olympics it may not
[38:04.240 --> 38:08.800]  happen now because we're talking about it but listen in the 1972 Olympics in
[38:08.800 --> 38:12.640]  Munich they have one day in September I don't know if it's on the new DVD I saw
[38:12.640 --> 38:19.240]  it in theaters in the late 90s when it came out narrated I saw it Randy Couture
[38:19.240 --> 38:24.600]  is that his name it's like saying I'm just gonna I'm gonna start a fight with
[38:24.600 --> 38:28.240]  Randy you know Couture or something like that I mean that's how crazy this is
[38:28.240 --> 38:31.560]  you know them saying Iran is now gonna do this but getting back to one day in
[38:31.560 --> 38:36.360]  September but guys I want to buy that I keep saying buy it buy it buy it will
[38:36.360 --> 38:41.400]  you have one of the crew buy one dead September of the DVD or whatever but the
[38:41.400 --> 38:45.440]  point is or off Netflix or whatever I just want to play the clip at the end but
[38:45.440 --> 38:49.680]  my point is I don't know if they've still got it on the DVD but I know it won an
[38:49.680 --> 38:56.280]  Academy Award I saw it at the Arbor movie theater in Austin Texas the old
[38:56.280 --> 39:00.040]  Arbor when it's still inside the mall in north Austin I don't know why those
[39:00.040 --> 39:08.320]  details matter I saw it in the late 90s I think it came out like a 99 and at the
[39:08.320 --> 39:12.220]  end of the movie they go ahead and say oh yeah German intelligence actually
[39:12.220 --> 39:16.160]  staged the hijackings with the with the terrorist and was there was actually a
[39:16.160 --> 39:19.640]  group and you know an intelligence who was working with the group above the
[39:19.640 --> 39:25.440]  people that launched the attack in Munich and you know they have an hour and
[39:25.440 --> 39:29.720]  a half documentary about the terrorists and all the rest of it and then at the
[39:29.720 --> 39:33.640]  end of the movie the former head of German intelligence laughs and says they
[39:33.640 --> 39:39.200]  basically staged a bunch of it I mean talk about it talk about throwing it
[39:39.200 --> 39:43.160]  in our face and again a lot of times they'll go out and hire a terrorist group
[39:43.160 --> 39:49.280]  that goes out and recruits real Muslim terrorists that was the case here but
[39:49.280 --> 39:53.000]  then security stands down to let them come in and do it that's my point I'm
[39:53.000 --> 39:58.000]  not saying there aren't some wild-eyed Muslim extremists and crazies from
[39:58.000 --> 40:02.560]  every group out there the point is the Western governments since the end of
[40:02.560 --> 40:06.680]  World War two and even before with the British have been funding the radical
[40:06.680 --> 40:12.560]  Muslims and using them to overthrow countries this new thing NATO's doing
[40:12.560 --> 40:18.560]  helping overthrow Egypt and putting in al Qaeda and Muslim Brotherhood this
[40:18.560 --> 40:21.720]  overthrowing Gaddafi who'd made deals with the West and putting al Qaeda in
[40:21.720 --> 40:27.280]  charge this having al Qaeda backed by US British and other special forces are now
[40:27.280 --> 40:31.000]  in Damascus you're attacking the presidential parliament and other
[40:31.000 --> 40:35.080]  facilities and this is a real war there's a giant guerrilla war with al Qaeda
[40:35.080 --> 40:41.160]  jihadis in in al Qaeda uniforms black uniforms with the flag of al Qaeda with
[40:41.160 --> 40:45.720]  the patch of al Qaeda it's on the news and it's yeah we got to get a side we'll
[40:45.720 --> 40:53.840]  work with whoever we have to that isn't something new that's incredibly old
[40:53.840 --> 41:02.920]  the British I mean Lawrence of Arabia is a true movie Lawrence of Arabia is a
[41:02.920 --> 41:09.160]  true story true story but they have it as if he's a hero going and unifying
[41:09.160 --> 41:13.680]  what was the desert in the Saudi Arabia and you know he goes and makes a deal
[41:13.680 --> 41:17.840]  with the Bedouins and gets weapons to them to go overthrow the other groups
[41:17.840 --> 41:22.600]  that's really what happened that's that's the group that funds al Qaeda that's
[41:22.600 --> 41:31.880]  the Wahhabist they put them in charge from people living in big tents out in
[41:31.880 --> 41:41.680]  the desert to giant sex palaces and then 15 of the Patsy hijackers who were
[41:41.680 --> 41:45.800]  intelligence operatives it came out they work for the Saudi government trained
[41:45.800 --> 41:51.160]  at US military bases that all came out the heads of the bases would come out
[41:51.160 --> 41:54.280]  and say these guys will train in my classes putting Muhammad out and then
[41:54.280 --> 41:58.280]  you see the headline head of defense language school Colonel being being
[41:58.280 --> 42:04.280]  court-martialed for releasing classified information again we don't know
[42:04.280 --> 42:08.520]  exactly what happened on 9-11 you know some say oh it was a triple cross you
[42:08.520 --> 42:12.280]  know we thought it was drills for hijacking but they use it as a real
[42:12.280 --> 42:16.000]  hijacking you know in this movie theater you got a person or persons with a
[42:16.000 --> 42:20.760]  bunch of high caliber you know semi-auto guns shooting people and guys tried to
[42:20.760 --> 42:24.720]  stop them and jumped on them and stuff but we're to believe people with box
[42:24.720 --> 42:27.680]  cutters let me tell you something if I was on an airplane people say well
[42:27.680 --> 42:32.680]  that's today no no I was on an airplane and four guys got up with box cutters
[42:32.680 --> 42:37.240]  and said do what we say I mean I'm not the toughest guy around but let me tell
[42:37.240 --> 42:41.360]  you something I live for stuff like this okay I mean I don't I don't like it
[42:41.360 --> 42:46.640]  but once once once the door opens once someone is violent in my face I mean I
[42:46.640 --> 42:53.240]  turn into an absolute vicious goblin like creature and most men I know when
[42:53.240 --> 42:55.880]  especially when you become an adult that's why adults don't get in a lot of
[42:55.880 --> 42:59.360]  fights because it's not like you're a teenager anymore and people go to the
[42:59.360 --> 43:05.200]  hospital people end up dying when adults get in fights I mean you imagine a plane
[43:05.200 --> 43:09.720]  full of a bunch of defense contractors former and current military and guys who
[43:09.720 --> 43:14.880]  all weighed about 180 pounds 160 pounds some of 140 pounds pull out box cutters
[43:14.880 --> 43:19.720]  I mean I mean let me tell you something you're about to get hurt real bad I can't
[43:19.720 --> 43:25.080]  even get physically excited physically until there's a threat I know most men
[43:25.080 --> 43:28.880]  are that way I mean the minute somebody pulls by the way that's happened to me
[43:28.880 --> 43:32.360]  repeatedly I grew up in Dallas I've had people pull knives on me I've taken them
[43:32.360 --> 43:36.360]  away from them I've used their head like a basketball on the ground but the point
[43:36.360 --> 43:41.440]  is and then gone to jail even though until later you know the fact came out
[43:41.440 --> 43:46.960]  that I was attacked sad issue all of you know the truth here's the toll free
[43:46.960 --> 43:53.200]  number 800 2599231 guys will you launch the phone system for me thank you 800
[43:53.200 --> 44:01.080]  2599231 is the toll free number to join us on air today I'm just gonna take
[44:01.080 --> 44:05.040]  calls for 20 30 40 minutes and just try to try to regroup here because I've got
[44:05.040 --> 44:08.040]  a whole bunch of video clips and audio clips I want to play I've got whole
[44:08.040 --> 44:11.240]  stacks of research and documents if you're a radio listener if you were
[44:11.240 --> 44:15.680]  watching on prisonplanet.tv no exaggeration I would guess there are
[44:15.680 --> 44:19.840]  300 plus articles and documents in here in front of me and I have looked and
[44:19.840 --> 44:24.120]  read almost all of them just the last two days and I want to cover it all it
[44:24.120 --> 44:34.280]  is all off the charts crazy 800 2599231 and it makes my head spin I just had
[44:34.280 --> 44:42.440]  the article here it is this was a ABC News and RT we reported on this over a
[44:42.440 --> 44:47.720]  year ago because independent journalists and others went into the area at their
[44:47.720 --> 44:52.000]  own risk we first saw that they weren't reporting any radiation in and around
[44:52.000 --> 44:57.440]  Fukushima but in other areas they were and it turns out the radiation is many
[44:57.440 --> 45:01.880]  times what they said it was and eight times what they said it was hitting the
[45:01.880 --> 45:07.480]  West Coast and it turned out of course giant tuna caught last year just three
[45:07.480 --> 45:12.040]  months after the event had high levels of radiation and milk and food all over
[45:12.040 --> 45:15.160]  the US has been found with it that's actually been in the news but back of
[45:15.160 --> 45:20.920]  the paper Fukushima contractor forced workers to fake radiation readings and
[45:20.920 --> 45:25.560]  to say that there was low radiation when it was actually high that's our team a
[45:25.560 --> 45:29.400]  company charged with decontaminating the devastated Fukushima nuclear power
[45:29.400 --> 45:34.000]  plant encouraged its workers to falsify lower falsely lower the radiation
[45:34.000 --> 45:40.160]  dosimeter readings by covering the devices with lead according to a leaked
[45:40.160 --> 45:45.600]  tape of an internal meeting this is all over the Japanese news right now we
[45:45.600 --> 45:49.880]  first posted it a couple days ago there were commenters on info wars.com and
[45:49.880 --> 45:53.040]  normal people saying we've made it up and it wasn't real and again that's a
[45:53.040 --> 45:56.200]  psych warfare tactic we've tracked a lot of their IP addresses Department of
[45:56.200 --> 46:00.360]  Defense they have to at least just say it isn't true up front because then the
[46:00.360 --> 46:07.240]  mind mitigates that and somehow creates denial even though you know it's true
[46:10.920 --> 46:15.480]  and so that's all I mean all right I'm gonna go to your phone calls here
[46:15.480 --> 46:21.960]  because again I'm just completely overwhelmed with news suspect arrested
[46:21.960 --> 46:27.800]  in LA homeless stabbings you know what the answer is to that of course banned
[46:27.800 --> 46:34.960]  knives because someone used it to kill people and of course Piers Morgan
[46:34.960 --> 46:55.120]  Felipe Calderon Bloomberg ABC News the usual suspects Michael Moore they're
[46:55.120 --> 47:00.880]  all running around saying right now that we have got to restrict our guns
[47:00.880 --> 47:05.240]  because of what this supposed person did and everybody's just officially buying
[47:05.240 --> 47:09.200]  the story in the media that they say it's him that's it he's the gunman he's
[47:09.200 --> 47:13.200]  in a jail cell flopping around screaming he's the Joker I mean they can
[47:13.200 --> 47:17.600]  commit a mass shooting and give me a drug that totally fries my brain where
[47:17.600 --> 47:21.080]  I'm flopping around and then just say I did it I mean this is the oldest trick
[47:21.080 --> 47:24.200]  in the book and they describe an operation Northwood's how to frame
[47:24.200 --> 47:29.000]  patsies for mass shootings that you guessed it what they do an operation
[47:29.000 --> 47:33.800]  gladio movie theaters bus stations things like that and now they're calling
[47:33.800 --> 47:37.960]  for the TSA in the bus stations and all the rest of it we told you that was
[47:37.960 --> 47:42.880]  coming so what I'm gonna do is this I'm gonna come back take calls for 30 40
[47:42.880 --> 47:48.200]  minutes then I'm going to try to do a focused news blitz on world news and
[47:48.200 --> 47:54.560]  more and when our two guests join us that are experts on false flag terror
[47:54.560 --> 47:59.720]  and specifically the Oklahoma City inside job event we're gonna tie it in
[47:59.720 --> 48:08.320]  to this event because the prime suspects if it's a false flag is the very
[48:08.320 --> 48:12.920]  Justice Department caught running the false flag of fast and furious to blame
[48:12.920 --> 48:18.920]  the Second Amendment it's a very same crew and I had on researcher and former
[48:18.920 --> 48:30.360]  Marine grabbing the DVD here from a noble lie Holland Vanden Neuenhoff and
[48:30.360 --> 48:34.760]  Chris Emery I had him on just a few months ago so I would suggest they go
[48:34.760 --> 48:38.240]  get the last interviews where we said false flag alert and I remember
[48:38.240 --> 48:42.400]  discussing with them what type of false flags we expected and we said shopping
[48:42.400 --> 48:46.480]  malls grocery stores movie theaters I remember that if it wasn't the last
[48:46.480 --> 48:50.920]  interview it was the one before that because we were all very concerned that
[48:50.920 --> 48:54.800]  they were about to pull one with the UN treaty and the rest of it so their
[48:54.800 --> 48:58.800]  experts probably even more so than I am on Oklahoma City because they focus on
[48:58.800 --> 49:02.920]  it full-time I mean I've forgotten so much about it there's so much proof it's
[49:02.920 --> 49:07.240]  like an ocean of it they're going to be joining us that's why we kept saying in
[49:07.240 --> 49:10.720]  articles and on the air this film is important because they're getting ready
[49:10.720 --> 49:15.400]  to stage mass shootings to blame it on the Second Amendment and the Patriot
[49:15.400 --> 49:20.960]  Movement back we said the last three or four interviews that that's why they
[49:20.960 --> 49:24.920]  put the film out now was because the very same crew that carried this out is
[49:24.920 --> 49:30.520]  now in the White House the people that run Obama ran this they even put out
[49:30.520 --> 49:33.220]  remember Glenn Beck going on air and saying they're going to stage a new
[49:33.220 --> 49:38.040]  Oklahoma City and blame it on me he pointed himself because in the fundraising
[49:38.040 --> 49:42.840]  memos they mentioned Glenn Beck well on media matters they say Alex Jones

[54:44.480 --> 54:52.920]  and we would be insane if we did not investigate government for this and it
[54:52.920 --> 54:57.840]  just hit me like a ton of bricks last night that we had had Holland, Vander
[54:57.840 --> 55:03.440]  Neuenhof and Chris Emery on and others in the last four months saying we all
[55:03.440 --> 55:08.960]  believed terror attacks were coming and that from the pre-propaganda we were
[55:08.960 --> 55:12.960]  seeing that I believed it was going to be mass shootings of shopping malls
[55:12.960 --> 55:20.880]  grocery stores and movie theaters to bring in the TSA and I know I said that
[55:20.880 --> 55:26.160]  over and over and over again so radio listeners if you can dig that out of my
[55:26.160 --> 55:30.000]  last interviews with them I don't have the crew to do it we will then play it
[55:30.000 --> 55:36.480]  on air and again it's not about oh we're right we told you so the White House
[55:36.480 --> 55:41.000]  and Obama's advisors have said in the financial times of London and their
[55:41.000 --> 55:47.520]  internal fundraising memos to you know mega donors that don't worry there's
[55:47.520 --> 55:51.200]  gonna be a new Oklahoma City or 9-11 and we're gonna blame it on people they
[55:51.200 --> 55:56.360]  don't say we're gonna do it they just say don't worry there's gonna be one don't
[55:56.360 --> 56:00.120]  worry the restaurant's gonna burn down we're gonna get the insurance money
[56:00.120 --> 56:04.280]  imagine if the owner of a restaurant said we're bankrupt but don't worry
[56:04.280 --> 56:07.800]  everybody's worked here for years there's gonna be a fire next week and so
[56:07.800 --> 56:12.080]  we're gonna build a new restaurant with that money then if the restaurant burnt
[56:12.080 --> 56:15.920]  down the next week the fire marshals would be there saying you have a right
[56:15.920 --> 56:19.680]  to remain silent anything you say can and will be used against you the court of
[56:19.680 --> 56:24.520]  law they'd have the arson dogs in there finding where they dumped the gasoline
[56:24.520 --> 56:29.440]  but no no no no all these White House advisors Robert Shapiro the big lawyer
[56:29.440 --> 56:34.600]  all of them say barring an Oklahoma City or a 9-11 so the president can rally
[56:34.600 --> 56:41.880]  people and be a hero he's not gonna get reelected and now he's getting his bump
[56:41.880 --> 56:46.400]  in the polls just watch and he's out there grandstanding in Colorado having
[56:46.400 --> 56:49.760]  his surrogates call to restrict our guns and he's like I don't know if I'm
[56:49.760 --> 56:53.600]  gonna call for that you know my my UN treaty doesn't restrict your guns
[56:53.600 --> 56:57.680]  they're actually they have to see a far out saying that and and Obama today oh
[56:57.680 --> 57:03.800]  but guess what different TV channels I've got that in my stack different TV
[57:03.800 --> 57:11.560]  channels guess what they're doing NBC's Gregory blames Batman massacre on
[57:11.560 --> 57:18.160]  angry political dialogue says Rush Limbaugh to blame for shootings they wrote
[57:18.160 --> 57:21.600]  an article Friday morning seeing how long until they blame somebody like
[57:21.600 --> 57:27.960]  Alex Jones or Rush Limbaugh there you go rush Limbaugh it's your fault poor old
[57:27.960 --> 57:33.200]  rush hardly even talks about the Second Amendment Rush Limbaugh is like milk
[57:33.200 --> 57:37.400]  toast ladies and gentlemen I mean rush was people say good we hate Rush Limbaugh
[57:37.400 --> 57:40.720]  so many even conservative libertarian host I know behind the scenes are
[57:40.720 --> 57:44.920]  jealous and listen folks if they can destroy Rush Limbaugh let me give you
[57:44.920 --> 57:48.960]  a little newsflash they take down the biggest person first and I know you seem
[57:48.960 --> 57:53.400]  as establishment let me tell you the Obamanoids don't they blamed Oklahoma
[57:53.400 --> 57:57.320]  City on him and see oh I just called Watson during the break and I'm gonna
[57:57.320 --> 58:01.760]  come back go to your calls I promise he's gonna write another article right
[58:01.760 --> 58:06.760]  now because I'm like whoa Paul we've got the memos we've got the statements that
[58:06.760 --> 58:10.360]  they wanted to do Oklahoma City to blame on us we've got Glenn Beck saying
[58:10.360 --> 58:13.720]  they're getting ready to stage something we've got Michael Savage put all that up
[58:13.720 --> 58:17.400]  there with our clip saying it and all the articles where we warned about it
[58:17.400 --> 58:21.440]  basically you know you'd be crazy to not look at Obama's people because they
[58:21.440 --> 58:25.320]  did fast and furious you've been I mean look you go after who's been caught
[58:25.320 --> 58:32.720]  doing stuff like this before I mean the current Attorney General in 1995 was up
[58:32.720 --> 58:40.240]  to his eyeballs in Oklahoma City folks okay that's why they're the suspects

[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:43.480]  eerie coincidence Colorado University had a identical drill on same day as
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:48.200]  Batman massacre exercise revolved around gum and attacking theater with a
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:54.680]  smoke bomb just like 9-11 the exact same targets exact same time so that
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:58.520]  NORAD would stand down just like 7-7 exact same targets exact same drill
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:04.080]  exact same time wow the nightly news tonight we've got a pull up all of those
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:07.920]  other drill articles and videos where they admit it let's go to your phone

[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:25.720]  in Arizona you're on the air what do you make of all this oh we're going Alex
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:32.360]  good well basically just one second here basically back when I was in the
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:37.800]  Marine Corps we went to boot camp and a lot of people who deny the fact that
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:42.200]  you can be brain-wide all you have to do is look at Marine Corps boot camp
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:50.280]  recruits and you don't need drugs all you need is you know 13 weeks in a you
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:54.200]  know boot camp and you can brainwash people so it's very possible to get
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:59.040]  somebody even on a low level to do what they're told very quickly so it's not
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:05.120]  impossible at all and I've won a lot of my friends about this event and a lot
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:09.320]  of them are kind of picking up on it and texting me and saying yeah this is all
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:15.680]  winding up to be exactly what you said so yeah I'd say about 90 and the votes
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:21.640]  show that on YouTube as well about 95% of people agree the 5% or so that say
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:28.600]  I'm I'm out of line you'll say oh is it always government yeah like I said the
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:33.200]  India attack a few years ago at Mumbai was government it turned out the CIA ran
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:36.760]  it I'm you know I told people months before they were putting al-Qaeda in
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:42.360]  Libya as we had reporters on the ground was confirmed I mean listen folks it's
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:49.080]  scary to go up against these people it's not fun but I am forced to respond to
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:53.200]  this I am forced to cover this and look when you got all the White House
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:57.080]  advisors saying gee an Oklahoma City would sure pull our bacon out of the
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:03.800]  fire and then you have it happen I mean I don't know what do you think oh well
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:07.680]  like I said I warned a bunch of people that they were going to get some crack
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:12.560]  pot to do something like that it's not hard it's always the same MMO it's
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:17.640]  some guy that nobody knew and also now the blue he goes on a shooting spree so
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:21.680]  it's not hard to get somebody in there slip them some drugs do it over a few
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:25.160]  for a few weeks get them to talk him into doing something stupid and brain
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:29.280]  wash him into thinking something is not but a real quick Alex I try to get in
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:33.560]  over the last week I wanted to throw out a few points one other thing is as
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:36.920]  well I always been warning my friends of what's called a positive effect false
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:41.520]  flag where they'll actually make an event they'll save people from something
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:45.240]  bad so they can pose as the heroes as well that's where they go out and find
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:48.680]  mental patients and get them to build a bomb and then bust them before that's
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:53.520]  a much more humane way to steal our rights yes yes and so I wanted to throw
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:56.520]  that out there always look at the gas prices when they go down and stuff
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:00.560]  that's all false flag just just keep that in mind one of the things I always
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:04.760]  tell your I want to tell everybody to your audience is that all these drones
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:09.480]  and all this stuff and people say our second amendments outdated well all you
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:13.520]  have to do is go to Radio Shack learn electronics and all these drones and all
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:17.200]  this stuff can be hacked and tell your audience and they're only getting all
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:20.200]  the drones to intimidate you and make you feel like they've got overwhelming
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:25.000]  force and so they can sit back cowardly and send them out to attack you you
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  just don't face the enemy on at the time of their choosing if we go into some
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.480]  type of hot war with these people I'd rather just engage in a hot info war
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:41.120]  then you don't face them at their time of their choosing that's just children
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:45.760]  and and childlike minds that say oh we're nothing compared to a modern
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:50.400]  military if modern militaries don't have the moral authority they can't win a
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:57.400]  war I mean this whole thing couldn't even occupy bad dad folks okay it's all
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:02.600]  bark and no bite all the troops have been soft killed you've heard Alex

[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:45.120]  and we had a guest on a tv producer who infiltrated just a few months ago and
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:48.520]  found that there's no real security and that they are saying an event is going
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:52.280]  to happen at the end of the olympics so big it's going to change our world
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:57.280]  forever and everything that that guy told us on air is now being confirmed

[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:08.080]  also we've got incredible articles up at info wars dot com colorado university
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:14.880]  held identical drill on same day as batman massacre well that's the cuda
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:19.080]  draw that's the cherry on top right there later after i take calls i'm going
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:22.680]  to go over the evidence of this being a staged event where they use a drugged up
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:26.680]  mentally ill patsy to take the fall of course that's just if you believe the
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:32.960]  memorandum for the secretary of defense unclassified justification for u.s.
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:38.040]  military intervention known as operation northwoods that tells you how to
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:44.320]  shoot up the movie theaters and even how to frame the patsy's isn't that just
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:49.520]  special and then there's the levon affair and all the others there's a
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:56.320]  operation gladio that was a shooting up movie theaters shooting up movie theaters
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:59.680]  why do they like that because you can frame your patsy have your guys in black
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:05.560]  mask multiple quote what they thought were cops get away and then then you
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:10.440]  find the drugged up patsy who's on devil's breath and has had shock therapy
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:15.440]  but he'd have to be in some government program where they could oh a brain
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:21.320]  interface neurology advanced program fun about the department of defense just
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:29.960]  like Theodore Kaczynski the unabomber oh just like major Hassan oh oh and then
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:34.320]  the very university was running a drill of the exact same thing happening why
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:41.360]  do they do these drills so that there's NSA chatter of a drill so that good
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:46.680]  people in the NSA and other systems that hear it in live time don't respond
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:50.480]  because most the agencies aren't involved very small compartmentalized parts
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:56.480]  are that's why on 9 11 exact targets exact times hit by hijack jets CIA and
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:00.760]  department of defense drills AP Reuters New York Times look it up in all my 9
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:07.840]  11 films 7 7 Peter Powers visor consultancy ITN and BBC send my film
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:12.400]  terror storm just look it up I'm going to play with not only news tonight do a
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:19.760]  whole report on this how they do drills exact targets at exact time at exact
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:28.000]  locations three trains and a bus one group didn't blow up the train like they
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.800]  were supposed to ran we're all shot in front of everybody at Canary Wharf they
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:37.560]  thought they were taking part of the drill the head of it was mr. a SWAT 7 7
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:41.920]  known in my six source on that Fox's Associated Press got television BBC
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:46.240]  showed you those articles yesterday on the radio or prison planet dot TV viewers
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:49.480]  we actually showed them but for radio listeners we gave you the headlines but
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:54.720]  again I'm supposed to just ignore all this oh exact drill of movie theater
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:12:00.400]  attacked and it's a tabletop but but again you do the tabletop so there's the
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:05.600]  planning the chatter you've got to have that so if you get caught like FSB got
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:10.200]  caught in 99 blowing up a fourth building to blame it on Chechens so
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:18.040]  Putin could get elected fourth building getting bombed actually the suburb of
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:22.080]  Moscow the cops caught them as cops had family living in the building so they
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:26.840]  were staked out and they caught them they caught the FSB planting hexagon US
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:32.720]  Russia US and Russia use hexagon on the pillars in the basement of the
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:39.240]  apartment building and the feds in Russia swooped in and grab the tapes and
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:45.480]  grab their guys and said national security we were running a drill of
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:51.800]  blowing up the building and the police kept part of the explosives back that
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:55.720]  the government didn't grab and came out a few days later and said no no no it was
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:58.440]  real they were really gonna do it of course you know what happened to those
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:05.560]  police officers same thing that happened to Terrence Yakey from Oklahoma City
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:11.760]  cop of the year he saved dozens of people's like a NFL linebacker type big
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:15.880]  black guy went in saved all the people putting them on his back carrying him
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:20.960]  out like you know right out of Hollywood and he saw the feds and what they were
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:25.800]  doing and well you know what they did to him they tortured him real good he told
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:29.200]  his wife and family they're following me they're gonna kill me he told him that
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.640]  not there you know they're coming to kill me I've got to go to the storage
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:37.000]  locker outside town and meet my partner and giving them material you know they're
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  coming to kill me and then he called his partner he said the feds are behind me
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.360]  and of course you know they took a real good care of him and then I've
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:50.600]  interviewed the police officers who were there and had the government come
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:55.400]  into their offices and say oh you're the head of the canine unit Sergeant
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:14:00.520]  Browning you and your wife are gonna be dead if you don't drop this is that
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:02.880]  understood
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:11.080]  oh the very same Justice Department the very same man now in charge and that all
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:15.600]  these Democratic memos said mass murders mass shootings and bombings to be
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:20.240]  blamed on us we should just ignore those memos fact didn't I've been on air three
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:25.600]  times now Friday Sunday and now today and didn't didn't even hit me why I
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:29.800]  knew in my gut this was an inside job it wasn't my gut it wasn't the witnesses
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:33.160]  saying they saw multiple shooters or heard multiple shooters or saw smoke
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:37.360]  bombs from both sides or somebody let him in it wasn't all that it wasn't that
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:42.760]  the UN treaties coming up next week it wasn't the timing it wasn't that it was
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:46.280]  right down the street from Columbine and this military industrial complex center
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:50.640]  it wasn't that he was in a high-tech brain sciences brainwashing type
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:55.320]  Department of Defense funded program it wasn't that his very area study dealt
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:58.520]  with this type of stuff a racing memories of troops this is a Department
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:02.160]  of Defense funded program he was in oh oh you you've seen the articles soon the
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:07.520]  little racebed memories of the troops yeah you know that's called mind control
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:12.840]  see I just have all this data that just slams me bam and I don't even realize
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:16.760]  why I'm saying it's an inside job until I start sitting back and it's just an
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:23.000]  ocean of evidence is there a chance he was a lone nut on a bunch of psychotropic
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.320]  they now admit well he's definitely on the drugs we didn't know who he is people
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:31.080]  do people naturally get on these and a cop walks in Walmart and not shoot them
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:37.200]  for no reason yeah that happened in Austin but this thing's got gun grab
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.960]  written all over it ladies and gentlemen okay I'm gonna shut up and go to your
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:47.880]  calls it just makes my head span of course we've got a question a group known
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:52.040]  for staging false flags including fast and furious they're caught on fast and
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:58.640]  furious doing it to blame the Second Amendment it killed thousands state
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:02.440]  department with Mexico the Justice Department estimates 2000 plus in
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:06.320]  Mexico over 200 here and that's where they traced the guns directly to the
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:12.440]  dead bodies last number I saw was three dead cops three dead border patrol two
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:20.000]  of the cops proven one of the border patrol proven proven killed by guns so
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:27.880]  that's a false flag that killed people killed Ki double hockey stick Ki double
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:34.880]  hockey stick Ki double hockey stick dead dead dead dead dead dead is a door nail
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:39.880]  and they think you're so stupid they write articles in the Financial Times of

[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:47.480]  dumb Gary Hart for the CFR writes a public letter document energy saying

[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:57.760]  as you're told look it up look up Gary Hart's letter document energy he
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:01.220]  published it in the Huffington Post we interviewed him about it for truth
[01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:03.720]  rising
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:11.800]  I wish I wish you think it's funny going up against these people walking the
[01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:16.560]  razor's edge they're like oh we'll just say he's a cook and plus it'll make him a
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:21.560]  martyr we kill him oh but boss it sure be good to kill Alex Jones or maybe one

[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:29.960]  think I like saying it's these people you think I like having cops on who
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:33.240]  named names of FBI that have come in their offices and threatened to kill them
[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:37.960]  you think that's fun if they'll kill cops they'll kill anybody you think I like
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:42.280]  this you think this is you think I just say this because it's what no I live it

[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:54.320]  Jeff then Anthony then Matt go ahead Jim thanks for holding from North Carolina
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:57.680]  you're on the air you think I'm you think I'm wrong to think Obama might be
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:05.240]  involved in this I don't know about a Obama being a part of it or in it but
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:09.840]  I'll tell you you're dead on about this devil's breath I've heard her to refer
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:15.040]  to as dragon's breath and where I live at they baited test a lot of this stuff
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:18.640]  especially these snatching grabs that you see the little you know the black
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:25.000]  kid communities doing where I live it's 99% black and they just went into what
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:30.040]  they'd go into Walmart and steal all the electronics this this was like 10 years
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:36.040]  ago and they'll have Walmart security you know tape them and then they'll arrest
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:40.120]  them but every single one of them kids that I because I stay in and out of the
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:43.640]  prison system you know this is a prison planet you go to jail for anything and
[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:50.280]  everything around here this is the home of a Klee shake Mohammed Nate Turner back
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:56.360]  in the Civil War days but what they do is they take you you get arrested they
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:19:01.320]  take you down to the police station and they do drug interrogation why this is
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:06.320]  important is if you belong to any religious denomination that is
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:11.840]  classified as a cult now cult is somebody who uses drugs as a part of their

[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:51.800]  did it yeah they'd ship guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment and
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:56.000]  set people up but they'd they'd never you know have criminals go into a movie
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.320]  theater and shoot a bunch of people and the Mexican president says we should be
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:05.160]  made to turn our guns in now now we should believe whatever he says this is a
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:07.960]  country where tens of thousands get killed every year and the police are
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:14.920]  totally corrupt eyes rolling heads swaying and that bright red hair

[01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:54.200]  declassified let's talk to Anthony in Pennsylvania Anthony what do you think
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:26:01.240]  about all this Alex Anthony Antonello thanks for taking my call um this is
[01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:07.000]  absolutely incredible we've been talking about this for years we said
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:11.800]  all it's gonna take you know is one major event you know whether it be a
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:18.640]  mall a library movie theater anywhere you know we already see the TSA rolling
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:23.880]  into Union Station in Chicago we see these people it's that you know it's a
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:30.160]  complete takeover it is so obvious and you know I've been doing as much work as
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:35.080]  I can here's the thing is you and you know this you control the message you
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:42.120]  control the people and one of the things that I really focus on is calling local
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:49.560]  radio stations well I've been hammering on the NDA and you know things of that
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:54.120]  nature I just confronted Luke Congressman Lou Bartlett a couple days ago by
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:57.960]  the way it's totally blowing people away right now the NSA has been forced to
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:03.000]  admit they are spying on everyone in real time totally illegally what do you
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.760]  make of them running a drill of the exact same thing happening about now on
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:11.840]  the case of 77 it was even the same buses in same location same time this was
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:16.480]  just running a drill that day of the movie theater being attacked in the
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:23.200]  area and the guy using a bomb as a diversion while he shot people I mean
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:28.200]  I mean again every time they're running drills on 9-11 they were running drills
[01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:34.440]  of the same thing how obvious does this have to get I called Nancy Lafome she's
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:38.360]  the one who wrote that article in the Denver Post I called her a couple hours
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:42.760]  ago you know I asked her if it was okay for me to record the conversation and
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:48.680]  she told me that her either inboxes flooded with emails of people talking
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:54.000]  about conspiracies and that you know it happened afterwards and this was planned
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:00.800]  months ahead she said she said something about they got their idea from Israel but
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:07.440]  like you know yeah listen to this listen to this I watched some of the press
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:10.440]  conferences and that police chief who never talked about the victims but
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:13.880]  talked about a great job the police had done all that but he would just go on and
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:17.600]  on and just keep repeating it he said don't believe everything you read on
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:21.240]  the internet yeah no kidding but he was talking about quote conspiracy theories
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:29.080]  did you see that where he's like day one on Friday night he's up there saying you
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:32.840]  know you know don't believe what you read on the internet what like all the
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:37.400]  witnesses saying two shooters you mean like that right it doesn't surprise me at
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:41.720]  all and here's the thing like where I'm at in northeastern Pennsylvania our local
[01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:45.960]  radio stations we have a host who believes every well I don't know if he
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:51.840]  really believes it or not but he supports every single official story from
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:58.440]  JFK to now and you know I've organized Colin bombs and you know had organized a
[01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:02.820]  couple hundred people to call in and talk about this and he just spins it and
[01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:07.120]  spins it to the point where like I said now I can't even call their shows well
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:10.640]  that's all right just keep it up calling to all the talk radio and plug in

[01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:54.440]  got the motive and then I say hey we better look into the system being
[01:33:54.440 --> 01:34:00.440]  involved in this. Ladies and gentlemen for the last five months I had been
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:06.720]  selling a noble lie Oklahoma City 1995 and begging people I'm in it to buy it
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:10.840]  in the film I warned that Obama is probably gonna stage domestic terror
[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:15.520]  attacks to blame the Second Amendment. It's got Jane Graham that saw the feds
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:18.920]  planting the bombs in the building it's got the inventor of the neutron bomb it's
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:21.640]  got General Parton the head of Air Force weapons development the late
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:25.400]  Hoppy Hoddleburg the grandeur that was threatened his life was threatened if he
[01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:29.200]  didn't stop wanting to know about the feds and the bombs they interviewed the
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:33.480]  family members of the cop that was tortured murdered I mean it's just it's
[01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:37.800]  the only professional film look I made road to tyranny ten years ago and it's
[01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:41.080]  got the newscast with the bombs being removed and it's got some of the eye
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:46.040]  witnesses and but it's 40 minutes of a three-hour film in the past I put out
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:54.400]  like three-hour films and it's a professional film but I made it with my
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:59.480]  shelf and my wife and Buckley Hammond and Mike Hanson doing some of the
[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:03.360]  camera work four people worked on it and that was while I was doing a radio show
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:07.040]  that was you know ten years ago we were still a tiny operation a noble lie
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:13.480]  Oklahoma City 1995 looks like Discovery History Channel that's because some of
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:17.280]  the guys that worked on it worked for Discovery and History and they would
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:20.400]  hear all this over the years interviewing the eyewitnesses and
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:24.560]  survivors they all say basically all of them say it's an inside job and then
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:31.440]  and then they would be ordered to edit all that out for ABC CBS NBC CNN Fox and
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:36.400]  so that was how this film got made was all these years are like wow we want to
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:40.560]  make a film about the truth so that's why it looks so good is that it had a lot
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:46.040]  of big you know TV professionals involved in it a noble lie the only film
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:51.160]  exposing this false flag event in a professional and modern way you know
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:57.040]  where all the facts are in you know I first made my film about it just five
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:01.840]  six years after it happened the point is is this is as you know 16 years after it
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:07.040]  happened 17 years after it happened we have a noble lie available at infowarshop.com
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:12.080]  and these support true media and the whole crew we've got here and the
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:16.440]  filmmakers of this documentary they're gonna be joining us because what did we
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:21.400]  say get this out before they stage new terror attacks when we say what kind
[01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:26.680]  could they be new federal buildings mass shootings shopping malls grocery
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:31.960]  stores movie theaters I know I said it and our guests said it over and over again
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:36.840]  and then a month ago the FBI flyer came out the law enforcement we got a copy we
[01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:41.680]  covered it on air and they said movie theaters will be attacked and I said
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:47.200]  that means they'll attack movie theaters the FBI pulled that flyer we have the
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:53.600]  flyer say we have it up at infowars.com the point is ladies and gentlemen
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:58.040]  that's why this film needs to be shown to everybody a noble lie Oklahoma City
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:05.120]  1995 the very attorney general was the deputy attorney general and we have his
[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:08.440]  emails that came out in lawsuits they had email back then folks at the federal
[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:13.280]  government in 95 in point as they were using it and he said this is a d-day
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:17.600]  situation we got to get down there and get on top of this and cover this up
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:22.720]  right now and boy did they yeah cover what up the fact that all the bombs
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:27.000]  didn't go off didn't matter they had controlled emulation incorporated come
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:31.200]  in the same folks that got rid of the wreckage on 9-11 they came in blew it up
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:35.360]  took out the wreckage and poured concrete in with it and had Wacken Hut guards
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:41.520]  guarding it last time I checked a landfill with guards guarding it with the
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:46.760]  pieces mixed in with concrete in a 30-foot hole man you didn't want that
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:50.080]  getting looked at did you

[01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:05.200]  related but last year they had the in Nebraska or Iowa they had a PhD I don't
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:10.440]  know why these guys are doing something stupid but you can look it up to as an
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:16.160]  Iowa they've had about he ran over five motorcycles and he killed two people in
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:22.720]  cars and he was drunk or on drugs and he was a PhD and then they I mean I don't
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:27.240]  know why you know the answer banned cars of course I shouldn't joke they are
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:30.520]  talking about making us all be robot controlled in the future they're gonna
[01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:34.080]  roll out the Google cars they now have they're gonna have a better safety
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:37.560]  record and they're just gonna ban us driving our own cars folks you heard it
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:42.040]  here first just watch that's about five six years away they'll first give you
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:45.920]  insurance discounts if you let the robot take over part of the time and then
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:49.040]  finally they're just gonna phase out humans driving all together because
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:53.120]  there's gonna be so much distracted driving thank you for the call I'm
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:42:01.320]  going to go to Jeff and David and L Ray and Ted here in just a moment but first
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:08.560]  I wanted to play this clip and this is from the nightly news Friday with Darren
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:15.200]  McBreen it's titled ATF bots threatens whistleblowers in fact I'm gonna
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:17.920]  Twitter this out at real Alex Jones right now even though it went up this
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:21.480]  weekend because it's so powerful and McBreen makes a little joke at the end
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:25.840]  about the ATF boss because it's like big brother it's a video with him from the
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:30.480]  head down to his chest and he's standing there with a blue background and he's
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:34.840]  saying you basically well the full videos out there because the ATF didn't
[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:39.360]  follow orders and leaked it that you'll be punished if you whistleblow you've
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:44.640]  got to go to the chain of command up to Eric Holder who's in contempt of
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:48.080]  Congress and ordered the entire operation for Obama to blame the Second
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:53.160]  Amendment and the Chicago Tribune and El Paso Times report they also ship drugs
[01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:57.480]  back in and mash by the tons but the media outside of that never picks it up
[01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:03.120]  so you're supposed to just report to I mean if a gang member in your
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:06.400]  neighborhood let's say rape your daughter you should find the leader of
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:10.040]  the gang and go to them and tell them about it I'm sure they'll really care
[01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:14.520]  about that a whole lot or of a wild dog bites you live out in the country go
[01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:19.440]  find the leader of the pack and dress up you know like a sheep or something in
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:23.880]  the middle of the night and see if they don't attack you so here he is in
[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:27.560]  everybody's face and the Senate you know sent letters and said this sounds like a
[01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:32.960]  threat number one folks you're supposed to report on criminal activity to
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:37.680]  another agency or media you have a duty to do it and the fact is they have the
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:43.920]  NSA overtime spying on government employees to try to make sure you don't
[01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:50.920]  report on them so the answer is everybody start leaking info the answer is
[01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:55.760]  everybody start speaking out the answer is take action so they can't stop
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:44:02.120]  everybody you understand that okay let's go ahead and go to this report by
[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:06.000]  Darren McBrain and then back to your phone calls
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:14.040]  choices and consequences and what I'm talking about choices and consequences
[01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:20.840]  the disciplinary process what my expectation is as the acting director
[01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:26.640]  when it comes to the disciplinary process choices and consequences simply
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:33.360]  means that as an employee of ATF should you decide not to abide by the
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:37.920]  standards of conduct or the rules of the road should you decide that you're not
[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:44.360]  going to play by the rules there will be consequences choices and consequences
[01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:49.720]  means simply that if you make more choices that if you don't abide by the
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:55.720]  rules that if you don't respect the chain of command if you don't find the
[01:44:55.720 --> 01:45:01.040]  appropriate way to raise your concerns to your leadership there will be
[01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:06.840]  consequences there you go that's one without McBrain's commentary the one
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:12.560]  that is you know hilarious that Darren did about 50 times more powerful it's up
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:16.400]  at the Alex Jones channel at YouTube and I will have that Twitter doubt to
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:20.720]  everybody ATF boss threatens whistleblowers again I would have played
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:24.120]  it I'm not baiting you to oh go to my Twitter to see it I just asked for that
[01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:29.760]  all day that's not what we got so too bad okay let's go ahead and talk to Jeff
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:34.840]  in Oklahoma Jeff you're on the air welcome how you doing sir thanks for

[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:44.520]  already talked about one of them I turned on the lane stream media to see what
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:49.240]  kind of lives they were selling us today and they show the Colorado shooter for
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:54.640]  his first court appearance and you can you can definitely tell that they've
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:59.200]  got him drugged up on something I mean he can barely move he looks like he's
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:04.720]  about to go to sleep all sudden his eyes jolt he turns looks all over the place
[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:10.960]  goes into a trance they asking if he has anything to say and he doesn't even
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:15.920]  respond no I've interviewed people that are all that were on death row with
[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:21.360]  McVeigh and from death row who without their knowledge got it on the show the
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:25.760]  lawyers judge Jesse Turner to set it up and I've talked to others McVeigh would
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:31.120]  do this all the time in Jolly and West was in there every day or every other
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:35.720]  day the famous mind control doctor and then McVeigh could suddenly talk and
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:39.160]  stuff when they'd roll him out and then when he wasn't on drugs he would
[01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:44.200]  explain to the other cell mates or people across the cells that yeah he was a
[01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:49.120]  government mind control subject and was in special ops and that they set him up
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:52.880]  and they were gonna kill his family if he told the truth so I mean it just goes
[01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:57.640]  on and now they wheel him out as I predicted and he doesn't I mean they
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:47:04.080]  said he was flopping around spitting and didn't know who he was and then now here
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:08.760]  he is and there's no discussion of he's insane you know now he just goes to a
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:12.040]  mental institution no they're gonna they're gonna go right ahead with the
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:17.520]  whole process because it's just I mean look folks they could grab me drug me up
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:23.520]  committed crime say I did it put me on devil's breath or Halcyon have me say I
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:27.800]  did it on the news just like our troops when the North Vietnamese captured him you

[01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:36.080]  hadn't done and then send me to jail or they could do it to anybody and then he's
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:47.240]  in a Department of Defense funded advanced you know neuro interface program at
[01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:50.600]  the University there and that's where these guys just keep coming from what
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:57.960]  do you think I think it's pretty strange think my eyes are pretty wide open
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:03.520]  nowadays because once you once you find the truth and things you can see through
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:09.320]  the lies it's pretty easy well I mean even that maybe he was alone crazy who
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:12.440]  looks totally drugged up in court and they're not telling us they drugged him
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:17.600]  up I mean that's a whole issue right there the issue here is if the government's
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:21.560]  done this over and over again and writes memos saying how great it would be and
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:25.440]  have been caught doing stuff like this to demonize the Second Amendment aka
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:29.400]  fashion furious you've got to look at them as the number one suspect that's
[01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:37.080]  all I'm saying here another subject I kind of wanted to touch base on it's a
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:41.520]  little different but it's about the general public me and my wife went to a
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:46.120]  movie theater last week and they were playing classics and we went to watch
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:51.880]  clockwork orange which I'm sure you're probably aware of it and while we were
[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:55.880]  sitting in there they have a lot of themes of that are really pretty bad I
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:49:01.000]  mean trying to commit suicide a sexual assault and why these things are
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:05.400]  happening the people sitting in the theater are giggling and chuckling like
[01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:09.440]  it's something cute and funny and I'm just I'm I'm losing wait wait wait you
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:13.160]  went and saw a clockwork orange reared in the theater and people were liking it
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:17.640]  yeah they were chuckling and like giggling when he's trying to commit
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:23.280]  suicide that's an idea for us to do is sneak a camera in sometime when they
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:26.840]  have a showing at the Paramount or something of clockwork orange because
[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:31.320]  I've been in movies like natural born killers is designed to show you how
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:36.080]  horrible the media is and how sickening violence is when I was younger I didn't
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:39.800]  get that and I thought I was like just you know that it was pushing senseless
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:43.080]  violence it's the opposite and Oliver Stone since then I've actually watched
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:48.560]  the commentaries he explains that but people were giggling and laughing during
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:53.640]  rape and murder during the movie and so you're saying you went and saw it at a
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:58.000]  theater that rerun it and people were getting off on it yeah yeah me and my
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:01.960]  wife were both looking at each other like you know deep that's not the point
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:06.080]  you're supposed to get out of this movie the point is the movie is about mind
[01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:11.040]  control and it's about the government releasing criminals out of the prison and
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:17.080]  making them the police to target the nonviolent population and authoritarian
[01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:21.720]  takeover a clockwork orange is a powerful novel that Kubrick made the film
[01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:30.920]  out of and you notice in the film it's its writers who who and it's that writer
[01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:35.040]  who's written a clockwork orange hence that's the name of the novel I

[01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:34.520]  the history of government sponsored terror dozens of examples of our so-called
[01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:40.080]  government and other governments staging events to blame it on their

[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:19.760]  then the world UN uses China as launch pad for one world government one child
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:24.480]  policy so they want that worldwide all around a shooter had more in common with
[01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:29.320]  paramilitary police than Batman top Pakistani politician calls drone
[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:35.040]  strikes insane immoral war crimes yeah they'll kill like 20 30 40 100 plus
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:39.160]  innocent people to get one bad guy but that's not a tragedy when the whole you
[01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:43.280]  know apartment building gets blown up with a bunch of little kids in it you
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:46.920]  know but the same government that does that wouldn't stage a theater shooting
[01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:52.120]  they wouldn't stage fast and furious either NBC's Gregory blames Batman
[01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:57.320]  massacre on angry political dialogue insinuates rush limbaugh to blame for
[01:56:57.320 --> 01:57:00.440]  shooting you didn't know it was rush limbaugh's fault that that guy's clearly
[01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:05.520]  out of his mind with a bozo the clown hairdo it's not it's not the Batman
[01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:09.480]  franchise his fault I'm not saying it is even though it conditions people
[01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:14.880]  certainly not rush limbaugh but wonder wonder who would blame that on rush
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:21.200]  limbaugh again I said they do something like this and blame us for it and they're
[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:25.600]  doing it and they write memos saying how great it would be to have this but you
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:29.440]  know what they're not suspects sure they got the UN treaty next week and
[01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:36.680]  everything but they're not suspects no we are we rush limbaugh
[01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:42.280]  he you know it's his fault folks it's don't don't look at Obama or attorney
[01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:47.640]  general holder do not look at them I don't mean just encouraging the guy no
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:54.120]  no I mean you know setting him up they'd never do that even small town
[01:57:54.120 --> 01:57:57.120]  police departments get caught all the time framing people for murders they've
[01:57:57.120 --> 01:58:03.480]  committed but but the big feds they wouldn't do anything like that so
[01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:09.240]  everything is just fine ladies and gentlemen NBC's Gregory blames Batman
[01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:12.960]  massacre on angry political dialogue remind me guys when the guests join us
[01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:18.400]  to play that clip cuing it up to where they blame rush limbaugh because that's
[01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:22.200]  one of the most important point shares Friday with Paul Watson wrote an
[01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:25.320]  article in the early morning saying they blame the Second Amendment and that
[01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:29.720]  they would blame talk radio and we were hoping it wouldn't be us when they roll
[01:58:29.720 --> 01:58:34.800]  out his computers but they haven't done that yet no they're just blaming rush
[01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:40.480]  limbaugh all right we'll be right back stay with us

[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:19.040]  that's uh the economic club of new york yes i've heard of that that's another elitist kind of a
[02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:29.280]  private cfr meets federal reserve organizing house yeah on the site um they proudly thank
[02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:35.600]  rocket fellers centennial society for running the program and um the last thing that kind of
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:39.680]  ties it all together actually uh working at an elementary school and i see a lot there but
[02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:46.880]  is the quote whole of government approach that they're pushing and uh i just wanted to mention
[02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:54.320]  that and uh the project on national security reforms website pnsr.org and uh thanks for having me on
[02:03:54.320 --> 02:04:04.320]  thank you all i know is we need guns because of crazy people like uh the bozo killer who is more

[02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:24.640]  going to get our guns with mass shootings and how that'll help obama reconnect with the public
[02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:31.280]  i mean i'm glad he was uh because that's how you're supposed to act when you find stuff like that
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:38.240]  is because that's what i do around here is i'm glad that people are concerned about stuff like
[02:04:38.240 --> 02:04:43.920]  this you're supposed to get upset about it because it's all there they all think you're idiots the
[02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:48.080]  only reason they get away with all this is because the average person is unconscious and just wants

[02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:07.760]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[02:05:07.760 --> 02:05:13.200]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much
[02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:18.480]  power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[02:05:18.480 --> 02:05:23.920]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power
[02:05:23.920 --> 02:05:29.520]  grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:34.720]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[02:05:34.720 --> 02:05:39.280]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[02:05:39.280 --> 02:05:43.840]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators

[02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:32.800]  all right coming up in the shower we're going to play some clips of people talking about multiple
[02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:38.480]  shooters uh smoke bombs or tear gas coming from different sides someone else letting the shooter
[02:08:38.480 --> 02:08:46.720]  in uh now we've seen who the media is saying is the shooter uh with bozo the clown hair everybody
[02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:51.520]  said that was men with black mask on who look like police officers that's what the eyewitnesses all
[02:08:51.520 --> 02:09:00.000]  over local news said but now he comes into court today not knowing who he is with all these facial
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:07.680]  ticks eyes wide open clearly bombed out of his brain and i hope someday they don't commit a mass
[02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:13.440]  shooting and then just roll me out and i suddenly can't talk and nobody asked is he drugged nobody
[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:20.480]  asked hey maybe somebody else did it uh maybe he's mentally ill i mean i could go commit a crime get
[02:09:20.480 --> 02:09:24.800]  a homeless person who's mentally ill in the car with me they're all over austin where i live thrown
[02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:31.760]  out of mental institutions and then put a bunch of weapons in the car commit a crime and then let
[02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:37.120]  the homeless person take the blame and that's what operation north woods right here in my hot little
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:41.440]  hand from the national security archive this is this is at the library of congress you can just
[02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:47.840]  look up pdf of national security archive and it talks about how to commit mass shootings
[02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:53.920]  and then how to even frame patsy's and who do they recommend uh in the gladio documents
[02:09:54.560 --> 02:10:00.240]  this just talks about framing patsy's mentally ill people people with criminal records you just frame
[02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:09.200]  and now we got a guy who can't talk the police said he was flopping around the last two days
[02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:13.520]  screaming and spitting and everyone screaming i'm the joker i'm the joker
[02:10:13.520 --> 02:10:24.720]  now he can't talk and is smiling and laughing and then obviously snapping in and out of things
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:30.240]  and of course he's on a bunch of psychotropic drugs which can make you do this on your own
[02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:35.200]  just like sergeant bales who went over there and killed 19 people in afghanistan and they're
[02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:43.520]  going to try to put him on trial he's not mentally ill he's going to go to the electric chair i guess
[02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:50.080]  now here's the deal we are collating all these clips right now the admissions even glen back
[02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:58.960]  covering it a year and a half ago the top white house advisors in memos and in restricted memos
[02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:03.520]  only the top donors like when obama's privately with a bunch of you know donors that give him a
[02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:07.200]  million bucks or whatever you know billionaires and people he says yeah don't worry we're going to
[02:11:07.200 --> 02:11:12.160]  get these better clingers that cling to their bibles and guns we're going to get them well
[02:11:13.360 --> 02:11:17.120]  to their people and paul watson's doing an article on this right now because it hit me this morning
[02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:26.080]  they said a new oklahoma city a new 911 or some big event will let obama reconnect with the public
[02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:31.200]  and be seen as a hero by the way you watch the polls aren't up yet but he went to colorado
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:35.920]  yesterday and today i'm guaranteeing you'll see tomorrow they'll be out by tomorrow maybe even
[02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:43.040]  the night i predict 10.5 bounce an index of polls some will be higher i predict a 10 point
[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:54.960]  bounce for obama watch now in his office erin dykes is in there he's found clips of the of
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:59.840]  the democratic operatives bragging on chris mathews after the giford shooting that this is
[02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:06.960]  going to help obama reconnect and this is going to help shut up the berthers now remember you got
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:12.000]  robert shapiro in the financial times of london saying we need a new oklahoma city or 9 11 if he
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:19.280]  doesn't get that he's not going to win they come one inch from saying they'll stage one they just
[02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:26.400]  say man this would sure be nice that's why last night i thought and this morning it really hit me
[02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:31.840]  even stronger we had to get the makers of the noble lie oklahoma city 1995 on the show because
[02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:37.360]  this is the only modern film exposing the false flag and just like fast and furious this is
[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:43.360]  they've admitted fast and furious was done to blind the second amendment cbs abc i've read
[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:51.440]  those headlines there on air you can look it up but other than that this is the most proven false
[02:12:51.440 --> 02:12:56.320]  flag where we've got the cops the eyewitnesses the people that worked in the building i mean we know
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:13:00.800]  who did it we know how they did it the film is so important guess what it's the very same crew
[02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:11.040]  now running obama so that's why i'm i'm saying we've got to look at this from the perspective
[02:13:11.040 --> 02:13:17.280]  of who's the number one suspect if somebody who looks like they're 65 years old with a long gray
[02:13:17.280 --> 02:13:24.880]  beard and blue eyes robs a bank the police know to see are there any bank robbers parole that fit
[02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:31.440]  this description because they normally have priors and they go you bet you know john doe got released
[02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:37.760]  two months ago this is him his mo he looks just like it they try to go find where he is they
[02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:41.920]  discover where he's at they get a search warrant they bust in they find the money right there
[02:13:41.920 --> 02:13:49.680]  there you go after people who do this over and over again and let me tell you who does it over
[02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:54.160]  and over again i covered this for two hours on the sunday radio show these people do okay
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:57.920]  and not just our government other governments do this over and over again
[02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:02.800]  operation gladio included not just blowing up bus stations and school buses
[02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:09.040]  and train stations this has been declassified by the italian government and others they would
[02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:15.200]  shoot up movie theaters and blame it on their political enemy and even grab a communist or
[02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:21.040]  somebody they didn't like and drug them up put them on trial put them in prison or kill them
[02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:28.640]  so again i've seen this over and over again i thought i'd get two gentlemen on because
[02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:35.120]  specifically they've been warning on my show and their own radio show and everywhere look for this
[02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:39.120]  and and and i remember and so this is homework for them because i know they're busy but i'm even
[02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:43.680]  more busy they've been on probably six seven times the last six months since their film came out
[02:14:43.680 --> 02:14:49.040]  well where we said get the film they're going to stage new terror attacks to get the un treaty
[02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:53.600]  passed the rest of it to put tsa on the streets and and we all talked about what type of attack and
[02:14:53.600 --> 02:15:01.120]  we all said highways police stations federal centers that have daycare centers because they
[02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:07.920]  like to kill kids that gets more effect movie theater shopping malls now i'm so busy i don't
[02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:12.400]  have time to go back to six seven eight interviews and find all the places we said that but we did
[02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:18.800]  so that's powerful to get people's attention we're not just saying this now we said this before
[02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:25.920]  now i'm going to go to chris emory and holland bander new and hoff they join us bander new and
[02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:30.320]  hoff is a native oklahoma formerly serve us marine corps a rifle squad leader his broadcasting
[02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:34.480]  career started know seven as co-host of radio free oklahoma and later as co-host of the free
[02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:39.920]  mine report heard on a bunch of stations holland is also a writer and producer of an oval lie
[02:15:39.920 --> 02:15:44.720]  oklahoma city 95 and the first full link documentary examining the oklahoma city bombing and a lot of
[02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:50.800]  the new and suppressed evidence that proves the official story is a myth available in foreshop.com
[02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:56.480]  i should add i said get the film out it'll save lives it may stop them from staging new attacks
[02:15:56.480 --> 02:16:02.240]  or it'll have people informed who will be watching when it happens like our witnesses
[02:16:02.240 --> 02:16:06.640]  that were on the flight that saw the government get mutalib on the plane the underwear bomber
[02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:12.080]  chris emory is producer of noble lie as well and has been working for decades to expose the
[02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:18.400]  globalist and they join us right now it's the winner of a bunch of film festivals uh and the
[02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:27.520]  vegas indy finalist uh rain i mean just a whole winner a bare bones festival uh also official
[02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:32.640]  selection san antonio film festival and a bunch of others they join us right now out of the gates
[02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:37.840]  i want to go to holland first holland i haven't even asked your opinion i had chris call you
[02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:42.240]  eight o'clock last night got you set up for the show i don't know your view on this i haven't
[02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:47.280]  heard what you've said about it uh so i want to hear fresh give me your take on what you think's
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:53.680]  going on here well thank you alex for having us on again and uh when this event happened this horrible
[02:16:53.680 --> 02:17:00.160]  event i reserved a judgment i don't like to leap to judgment but i must report that all indications
[02:17:00.160 --> 02:17:06.160]  that are at the very least that's many things are very fishy about this incident and i do think
[02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:12.720]  that most likely it was a false flag attack the timing is could not be better for those trying to
[02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:18.640]  push a gun control agenda they're trying to sign a major gun control treaty next week uh
[02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:24.320]  there are some many correlations between this attack and the tucson shooting of last year the
[02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:29.760]  jared lee lofner case and i have been actually looking into that case a lot lately uh some of
[02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:34.640]  the work of stephanie sludge at the government rag dot com she's done some excellent work
[02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:42.400]  and i do think that uh this probably is a false flag attack well i mean i even forgot that we've
[02:17:42.400 --> 02:17:47.440]  got to get wane madson on immediately wane madson told me first about stuff that later came out
[02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:51.920]  and of course each former of the national security agency he talked to a high-level
[02:17:51.920 --> 02:17:58.320]  federal informant that said that rolls and gifords who were both pro-gun were working on exposing
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:07.360]  fast and furious uh and uh that um definitely the shooter there was programmed jared lofner
[02:18:07.360 --> 02:18:13.200]  oh yes lofner bore all the hallmarks of an mk alter patsy and that's what we're looking at
[02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:20.560]  these days is this uh evolution of the methodology for executing these crimes and getting patsy's
[02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:27.280]  involved in mind control the use of psychotropic drugs erasing memories inducing um psychotic
[02:18:27.280 --> 02:18:34.400]  behavior especially with this the case of this latest suspect named homes um apparently he
[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:40.160]  there is no creepy backstory to this guy unlike lofner there were a lot of people who came out
[02:18:40.160 --> 02:18:44.960]  to say that he was a really creepy scary guy it turns out later that a lot of those sound bites
[02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:51.200]  were probably faked anyway but with this kid uh there seems to be no creepy backstory just
[02:18:51.200 --> 02:18:58.160]  out of the blue he flips out and decides to become the joker and kill uh at least a dozen people
[02:18:58.160 --> 02:19:04.240]  and uh and also he was serving under a national institute of health grant and a neuroscience
[02:19:04.240 --> 02:19:10.480]  division of the university and the nih has been long implicated uh first hand oh yeah they use
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:15.200]  these programs under under experiments they use these under ewing cameron to actually kidnap
[02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:20.960]  test suspects uh subjects and use them for mind control i mean he's right in the middle of a
[02:19:20.960 --> 02:19:27.520]  department of defense funded program in mind control sciences yes and we're already seeing
[02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:33.440]  like you've reported uh the the divergent eyewitness accounts now when i look at the primary
[02:19:33.440 --> 02:19:38.240]  purpose of a noble lie and the real reason we wanted to get it out was not just to expose the
[02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:43.600]  oakland city bombing um obviously that was the primary reason but the the deeper reason
[02:19:43.600 --> 02:19:49.040]  was that if an attack like this happened again a false flag attack people who had seen the movie
[02:19:49.040 --> 02:19:54.480]  seen the evidence seeing what this government is capable of doing what it has done in the past
[02:19:54.480 --> 02:19:59.440]  and what it is talking about doing in the future if an attack like that happens again be able to
[02:19:59.440 --> 02:20:04.720]  recognize sir stay there tell signs of an attack did you know that the global elite are now storing

[02:24:21.200 --> 02:24:27.360]  all right i want to get chris emery in here but holland continue with the points you're making
[02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:33.040]  after the last six seven years i know chris emery even more immersed in studying false flags and how
[02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:37.760]  they work you know it's hard for people that don't spend all their time studying this like i've been
[02:24:37.760 --> 02:24:43.440]  doing for 17 years to just hear us say oh yeah it's got the earmarks folks when we say it's got
[02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:50.560]  the earmarks i mean it's got the earmarks i wish this guy was a lone nut but now he's clearly drugged
[02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:55.920]  out of his mind on television and they're just going to tell us open and shut case we'd be crazy
[02:24:55.920 --> 02:25:02.320]  to believe a government that's been caught running so many other false flags exactly i mean this is
[02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:06.480]  not the world i want to live in i'd much rather be doing other things with my time but i'm not
[02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:11.600]  going to deny reality and the fact is that this government has time and time again as many governments
[02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:18.480]  around the world engaged in the false flag methodology that has cost innocent lives in order to enact a
[02:25:18.480 --> 02:25:25.440]  political agenda this is a basic 101 politics deal politics 101 we send it time and time again you
[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:30.560]  reference operation north woods earlier well they actually talked about shooting american citizens
[02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:36.000]  in on the streets of america to provoke a war with cuba that was from a joint chiefs of staff that
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:41.600]  was approved by the secretary of defense that was approved by the political structure of the day
[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:48.560]  up until jfk shot it down so it's not unheard of at all and they've done it before operation gladeo
[02:25:48.560 --> 02:25:54.320]  you were referencing the italian senate actually indicted the cia for its role in the balona bomb
[02:25:54.320 --> 02:26:00.880]  uh bus station bombing that cost 89 lives those were innocent people in order to enact a strategy
[02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:06.960]  of tension to keep people scared keep them on edge and make them vote for the politically convenient
[02:26:06.960 --> 02:26:12.320]  party convenient to the interest and now we have three memos in this case and like i said before
[02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:17.520]  is that we made a noble lie so we could wake people up to the fact of what this government was capable
[02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:22.560]  of and what would they would do in the future and we referenced a clinton cabinet official
[02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:28.560]  robert Shapiro who was in the government during the okloma city bombing uh who later opined in
[02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:36.080]  an editorial that obama needed another okloma city or 911 now this guy was just wasn't an observer
[02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:41.440]  perhaps making a callous remark he was in the government when the bombing happened he saw
[02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:47.600]  exactly how they benefited and he was saying the obama administration needed another mass murder
[02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:54.320]  to justify election and a political agenda and he actually said that quote and that's what's
[02:26:54.320 --> 02:26:59.680]  frustrating we then have all these other fundraising memos where they said don't worry don't worry a
[02:26:59.680 --> 02:27:05.280]  new okloma city or 911 and and they're going to get to blame i mean that right there they are so
[02:27:05.280 --> 02:27:11.200]  arrogant and then this magically happens right as they in the last six months have been delivering
[02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:16.960]  the tsa kits for checkpoints all over the highway we've talked to high level uh department
[02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:21.760]  transportation whistleblowers that say they're getting ready in the next few months to roll this
[02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:27.920]  out and then right on time this starts if we start seeing more of these then we know it's a setup
[02:27:28.720 --> 02:27:34.000]  and fast and furious one one of the i guess you could say good benefits of fast and furious was
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:39.680]  that it was unlikely that obama is going to be able to get uh gun control legislation passed
[02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:44.320]  because of the blowback from fast and furious it was simply ridiculous that the federal government
[02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:50.800]  is asking for restrictions on our gun use when the biggest uh gun runner in the past decade
[02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:55.440]  is to do a bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms under operation gun walker fast and furious and
[02:27:55.440 --> 02:27:59.040]  they did it to blame the second amendment blown out of the water and they did it to blame the
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:04.720]  second amendment cbs news uh broke that almost a year ago uh let's go to chris emory and we're
[02:28:04.720 --> 02:28:09.520]  about to go to break but chris what's your first look on this having three or four days to look at
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:14.640]  it uh first of all i want to extend my uh um condolences to the victims family members and
[02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:18.400]  survivors that's that's one thing that we did immediately when we studied the okloma city case
[02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:23.840]  uh people that lost their lives a very sacred uh loss second thing is i'm going to suggest every
[02:28:23.840 --> 02:28:28.400]  single one of these uh family members hire an attorney get a completely independent view of
[02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:32.880]  what's going on here because i i could guarantee you that you're being lied to i say that as a
[02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:37.040]  filmmaker that looks at the facts holland can back me up on this there were so many cases
[02:28:37.040 --> 02:28:41.520]  we reviewed and this is consistent and you did an excellent job on friday and over the weekend
[02:28:41.520 --> 02:28:46.160]  reviewing all of these cases are similar you cannot believe the federal government anymore
[02:28:46.160 --> 02:28:50.800]  simple as that the top dogs that are taking control of this case are going to lie the flat
[02:28:50.800 --> 02:28:55.040]  out bald-faced lie to the family members and have no compunction about doing it so they have to hire
[02:28:55.040 --> 02:28:58.640]  independent forensic experts and independent counsel to make sure that they get the truth
[02:28:58.640 --> 02:29:04.400]  and what happened to their loved ones that's the bottom line and uh i it's it's frustrating
[02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:08.240]  because we see this happen time and time again and we've got to get the truth out on this
[02:29:10.240 --> 02:29:14.800]  well i agree with you i mean it would be a lot less scary to think he was just alone ronald
[02:29:14.800 --> 02:29:21.120]  mcdonald killer i forget calling the joker but they're already saying he's the guy and he can't
[02:29:21.120 --> 02:29:26.720]  even talk he's obviously bombed out of his brain we knew we'll talk about jolly and west
[02:29:26.720 --> 02:29:30.800]  and mind control when we get back that's my first question but i want you to be able to finish chris
[02:29:30.800 --> 02:29:35.840]  emory with all the points i know you've got there you want to go over because again these are guys
[02:29:35.840 --> 02:29:42.880]  who have investigated in depth with the primary survivors and witnesses the false flag that was
[02:29:42.880 --> 02:29:48.720]  oklahoma city and i'm telling you the prime suspects of this new event are the people that
[02:29:48.720 --> 02:29:54.720]  did this okay that's why these guys are important we're on the march the empires on the run alex
[02:29:54.720 --> 02:30:04.240]  jones and the gcn radio network hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now
[02:30:04.240 --> 02:30:09.200]  storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle did you know that in a real
[02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:14.000]  meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all
[02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:17.840]  performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[02:30:17.840 --> 02:30:22.960]  again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[02:30:22.960 --> 02:30:29.760]  seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food

[02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:23.520]  day they owned an auto repair shop down the street instead they went in there and started

[02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:45.840]  movie theaters and places where westerners were at and bomb their you know churches and things
[02:34:47.440 --> 02:34:51.280]  there've been a lot of other events i went over to them yesterday the point is is that when you
[02:34:51.280 --> 02:34:58.160]  study this how did how did the cia and mi6 overthrow mohammed mozadek in 1953 and i ran
[02:34:59.840 --> 02:35:05.680]  look up operation ajax it's at cia.gov they don't even hide this to declassify
[02:35:06.720 --> 02:35:13.440]  they committed mass shootings of of mosque and of crowds of people who didn't like the more
[02:35:13.440 --> 02:35:18.320]  secular mozadek who wanted to develop iran but he wanted to keep part of the old money for his
[02:35:18.320 --> 02:35:23.840]  people he was the man of the year time magazine really nice guy you know compared to a lot of
[02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:27.200]  some of the extremists over there and who did they say they were going to put in power the
[02:35:27.200 --> 02:35:34.880]  muslim brotherhood they staged attacks claiming mozadek had done it against the muslim brotherhood
[02:35:34.880 --> 02:35:38.720]  type extremists they were really shiites so i guess muslim brotherhood's kind of a mixture
[02:35:38.720 --> 02:35:45.360]  the point is and then they double crossed them and put the shaw in and again mass shootings are
[02:35:45.360 --> 02:35:51.120]  one of their favorites uh to then blame it on who they want and you got all these white house
[02:35:51.120 --> 02:35:54.720]  memos in fact we're going to have them on the nightly news tonight and then we'll air part of
[02:35:54.720 --> 02:35:59.440]  these reports tomorrow a lot of work goes into all of this paul wasen's got a new article coming
[02:35:59.440 --> 02:36:05.200]  out very very soon the atf's in trouble putting out videos to their own people saying watch out
[02:36:05.200 --> 02:36:12.160]  don't report on our crimes all of this is happening right now the un treaty is just a couple weeks
[02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:18.000]  away they could sign it as early as early next week and then magically this happens
[02:36:18.640 --> 02:36:24.560]  are there real mass shootings yes are there real crazies yes but when you see something like this
[02:36:24.560 --> 02:36:31.280]  notice it happened close to columbine and littleton total shadow government command base
[02:36:31.280 --> 02:36:37.440]  department of defense uh funded programs going on i've been in these neuroscience departments
[02:36:37.440 --> 02:36:43.680]  you can't go in half the facility even though i might have accidentally got in got into one once
[02:36:44.800 --> 02:36:50.960]  the point is is that it's all about mind control because that's what control is all about mind war
[02:36:50.960 --> 02:36:56.000]  is what they call it chris emory finishing up your points continuing here i'm going to do a wide
[02:36:56.000 --> 02:37:00.080]  shot of this there's one of your shirts alexa's defend freedom and that's you defend your freedom
[02:37:00.080 --> 02:37:04.080]  by finding out the truth whether it be your loved ones or your neighbors or people that are
[02:37:04.080 --> 02:37:10.240]  horrifically murdered in the case of this last week we base our research on the facts and i
[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:13.760]  like i said i urge every one of the victims family members and survivors and their close
[02:37:13.760 --> 02:37:18.880]  friends that have the wherewithal to have their resources to find out what happened last week
[02:37:18.880 --> 02:37:22.480]  you deserve the truth and you're not going to get it from the controllers from the federal
[02:37:22.480 --> 02:37:27.680]  government i wish i could say the differently but we've gone over literally dozens of cases
[02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:34.400]  big and small and it's consistent they will lie to you and have no compunction about doing it i
[02:37:34.400 --> 02:37:40.160]  i really i want to we just got the issue rolling stone magazine out of my p.o. box this weekend
[02:37:40.160 --> 02:37:45.120]  the making of dark night two-page article on here and it's called nolan's reboot it's basically
[02:37:45.120 --> 02:37:49.840]  reviewed from director christ for nolan let me read this real quick just a few sentences anyone
[02:37:49.840 --> 02:37:55.200]  who's tried telling stories after 9 11 noticed that the real world becomes horrifically fictional
[02:37:55.200 --> 02:38:00.320]  so all of our fictions seem to aspire toward realism in nolan's films batman is a soldier
[02:38:00.320 --> 02:38:05.280]  and it echoes the whole war on terror they're the best expression of batman that's been done so far
[02:38:05.280 --> 02:38:10.640]  this is a line between reality and fiction and it's becoming the uh crystal clear that who's
[02:38:10.640 --> 02:38:15.280]  controlling and who's blurring that line that's right they're blurring it on purpose they're blurring
[02:38:15.280 --> 02:38:21.040]  it on purpose they i've talked to high level producers christ carter of x files i've talked
[02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:26.720]  to his top people the cia came to them and said do an episode where a hijack jet gets
[02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:31.920]  flown to the world trade center and the government's really behind it as a way to attack afghanistan
[02:38:31.920 --> 02:38:36.640]  and they use a drill to make everybody stand down what do you guys continue along that line
[02:38:36.640 --> 02:38:42.160]  of why they're trying to blur reality with fiction but then also what do you make of the drill at
[02:38:42.160 --> 02:38:49.200]  the university being run of a local movie theater being attacked by a guy who uses smoke bombs as
[02:38:49.200 --> 02:38:57.040]  a distraction well the the whole batman mythos is about legitimizing covert state operations
[02:38:57.040 --> 02:39:02.960]  it's all about the the forces of law and order that are unable to cope with this with this evil
[02:39:02.960 --> 02:39:09.440]  and they must call upon this this man in black to to skirt the law and do things that are really
[02:39:09.440 --> 02:39:14.640]  approved of but really society needs someone to be behind the scenes doing these covert
[02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:20.240]  operations has to use the nsa to spy on everyone a product maybe of the cold war i need to do my
[02:39:20.240 --> 02:39:25.680]  homework on the origins of the batman comics but that's certainly what the mythos is being used
[02:39:25.680 --> 02:39:32.240]  for today and we see like the telltale signs the the concurrent drills one of the signs
[02:39:32.800 --> 02:39:38.560]  that uh the that something is fishy as if there's a concurrent intelligence military or police
[02:39:38.560 --> 02:39:45.680]  operation or drill that simulates the real thing and now we have a drill being run out of a medical
[02:39:45.680 --> 02:39:52.400]  department simulating a mass shooting in colorado in a theater with bombs being thrown also almost
[02:39:52.400 --> 02:39:58.400]  to a t and this was the only medical department in the country that was running this kind of drill
[02:39:58.400 --> 02:40:03.840]  and it was just down the road from the theater from where it took place and again webser tarpley's
[02:40:03.840 --> 02:40:08.960]  written synthetic chair of 300 and something page book 400 page book breaking this down
[02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:14.400]  it's done so that other agencies if they discover it you just say it's part of the drill it's also
[02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:21.040]  used to confuse nsa chatter yes the the concurrent operations have several different functions one
[02:40:21.040 --> 02:40:25.840]  to move assets in place to cover their butts as they move assets in place it's under the cover
[02:40:25.840 --> 02:40:32.240]  of this drill and then afterwards um it also is part of the cover up because the people involved
[02:40:32.240 --> 02:40:37.200]  in executing what they thought was a drill only afterwards may or may not realize that it was
[02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:41.840]  actually part of the real thing and now they're either complicit or they're kept in the dark about
[02:40:41.840 --> 02:40:47.920]  their true role it also aids the cover up as in the case of oklahoma city after the bombing a lot
[02:40:47.920 --> 02:40:52.960]  of the cops on the scene were being told by their superiors that the the bombing was was the result
[02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:58.640]  of a sting operation that went bad of course this is not part of the official story but this is what
[02:40:58.640 --> 02:41:04.320]  the cops were being told this was a cover story the sting operation was to move the assets in place
[02:41:04.320 --> 02:41:09.520]  move the truck in place get the explosives inside the building and then afterwards is part of the
[02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:14.560]  cover up well now you're you're going to interfere with justice if you blow the whistle on the sting
[02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:19.920]  operation so it has a lot of different components and it worked and that's what they use they use
[02:41:19.920 --> 02:41:24.720]  what works you see the same methodology now that's right it's totally pathological because it's
[02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:31.840]  defective now now let's expand we also have the fbi flyer that was put out about theaters being
[02:41:31.840 --> 02:41:39.760]  attacked this was put out in june that theaters were going to be attacked by al-qaeda there in
[02:41:39.760 --> 02:41:46.960]  the colorada area that there'd be mass shootings in them they pulled the flyer once this shooting
[02:41:46.960 --> 02:41:52.240]  happened they don't normally do that why don't they want to sing that flyer well if this was
[02:41:52.240 --> 02:41:58.000]  legit alex they would actually be waving the flyer around and taking credit for warning the
[02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:02.400]  american people about this threat that the the fact that they pulled that flyer which i just learned
[02:42:02.400 --> 02:42:08.640]  from you means that they have something to hide and they don't want us knowing that they were warning
[02:42:08.640 --> 02:42:13.680]  that they actually had this plan underway perhaps they were picking up chatter and then it was
[02:42:13.680 --> 02:42:17.520]  covered up i don't know but that fact that they pulled that flyer means that there was something
[02:42:17.520 --> 02:42:20.880]  to hide definitely now i know we have a lot of new listeners tuning in every mellow second on
[02:42:20.880 --> 02:42:27.120]  am and evidence across the country explain to people why you do a false flag i mean they never
[02:42:27.120 --> 02:42:32.240]  do these unless there's a key piece of legislation like ominous crime bill they couldn't pass or
[02:42:32.240 --> 02:42:37.440]  assault weapons ban they can't pass or a un treaty where they're like two votes short in the senate
[02:42:38.640 --> 02:42:43.200]  and now there's all this pressure explain the motive for false flags and then i want to get
[02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:49.440]  into mind control exactly well the unfortunate consequence of people waking up to the truth
[02:42:49.440 --> 02:42:56.000]  is that when people start to resist an agenda and they can't get it passed by conventional political
[02:42:56.000 --> 02:43:01.840]  means they will get desperate and they will shed blood they have done this time and time again they
[02:43:01.840 --> 02:43:07.280]  did it in oakland city the timing of the oakland city bombing was two years after wake-up wake-up
[02:43:07.280 --> 02:43:12.160]  like you said happened exactly because of ruby rich the criticism the atf and federal law enforcement
[02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:17.520]  was law enforcement was facing over their unconscious unconstitutional abuses and infringement
[02:43:17.520 --> 02:43:21.760]  on individual rights and the atrocities they were committing that was all washed away with
[02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:26.400]  oklahoma city which happened two years the day after wake-up and then we look at this attack
[02:43:26.400 --> 02:43:34.000]  which happens a week before a controversial gun ban treaty is going to be voted upon at the same
[02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:41.440]  time that fast and furious has really um shot taken the wind out of the sails of the gun control
[02:43:41.440 --> 02:43:47.680]  agenda they needed something to push it over the top fast and furious had really been it really
[02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:52.560]  blew up in their face there was a lot of blowback and the unfortunate consequences of us waking up
[02:43:52.560 --> 02:43:57.040]  of people waking up and fighting back is that they get desperate and they pull these aces out
[02:43:57.040 --> 02:44:03.360]  of their sleeves and they shed blood they want to be able to pose as heroes and have the moral
[02:44:03.360 --> 02:44:07.520]  authority and they're the mommy and the daddy we're the bad children but don't worry they're
[02:44:07.520 --> 02:44:12.080]  going to keep us safe now with more highway checkpoints and pat downs at movie theaters and
[02:44:12.080 --> 02:44:18.480]  shopping malls all of this is coming and ladies and gentlemen that you cannot uh you know have
[02:44:18.480 --> 02:44:23.440]  pat downs for evil there is always going to be evil out there the answer is guns i want to show
[02:44:23.440 --> 02:44:29.360]  people a brief clip of their watching on tv if not just go to info wars.com and there's an article
[02:44:29.360 --> 02:44:35.520]  there from natural news by uh our own mike adams and he shows of course that video from earlier
[02:44:35.520 --> 02:44:43.200]  last week of the old man in the internet cafe and they don't want people thinking like this
[02:44:43.760 --> 02:44:52.640]  and understanding that that the answer uh to to people coming at you with guns is that you
[02:44:52.640 --> 02:44:58.400]  have a gun and here he is when two thugs come in with their mask on he comes in and is able to
[02:44:58.400 --> 02:45:08.320]  stop him let's go ahead and roll that video and then we can uh after that uh we can um also direct
[02:45:08.320 --> 02:45:18.080]  people a patron at palms internet cafe shot two robbers july 13th the suspects survived and were
[02:45:18.080 --> 02:45:24.400]  arrested and they come in one with a baseball bat one with a handgun they come in to rob everybody
[02:45:24.400 --> 02:45:29.040]  everybody's got to watch this video i'm going to shout out to everybody they know
[02:45:29.760 --> 02:45:33.680]  and then a senior citizen in the back

[02:45:45.840 --> 02:45:52.880]  and again it's already scrolled off the top news stories on info wars so i'm going to have it
[02:45:52.880 --> 02:45:56.400]  reposted up there so everybody can see it it's also at our twitter
[02:45:59.200 --> 02:46:05.600]  putter.com forward slash real alex jones says the media doesn't want you to know
[02:46:05.600 --> 02:46:11.040]  how the massacre could have been stopped the link to the videos right there putter.com forward
[02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:17.600]  slash real alex jones go there get out to everybody you know with the article so again
[02:46:17.600 --> 02:46:23.520]  um getting back into mind control what about mcvay in mind control they think we're so stupid his
[02:46:23.520 --> 02:46:29.120]  doctor was jolly and west tell us tell us about that chris emory he's uh what we consider the
[02:46:29.120 --> 02:46:35.440]  prince of darkness one of the worst um mind control uh well it's as far as most competent but one of
[02:46:35.440 --> 02:46:42.320]  the worst on a civil uh level i believe he um he had sir hand sir hand uh patty hurst and jack ruby
[02:46:42.320 --> 02:46:47.680]  as clients exactly exactly after when lee harbors was shot a couple days a couple days after he
[02:46:47.680 --> 02:46:51.920]  been blamed for the assassinations assassination of jfk uh they had to come up with a new way
[02:46:51.920 --> 02:46:55.920]  of neutralizing these patsies without making the obvious that they were shooting a witness
[02:46:55.920 --> 02:47:02.160]  sir han sir han was demonstrably a mind control victim i mean his own um his own psychiatrist
[02:47:02.160 --> 02:47:07.120]  testified to this several psychiatrists testified to the fact that this man is controlled by other
[02:47:07.120 --> 02:47:12.640]  parties and his doctor was dr jolly and west who actually got his start at the university of
[02:47:12.640 --> 02:47:18.640]  oklahoma and had to leave after killing an elephant with lsd under mk ultra funding he later went to
[02:47:18.640 --> 02:47:24.800]  ucla he worked on the sir han sir han case the patty hurst case and we know now that the sla the
[02:47:24.800 --> 02:47:30.480]  cmb of simbianese liberation army which kidnapped patty hurst and brainwasher started out of the
[02:47:30.480 --> 02:47:37.520]  bachaville medical facility a mind control mk ultra uh a medical experiment that is proven
[02:47:37.520 --> 02:47:43.920]  and so dr jolly west worked on that he later consulted and worked on the jones town case
[02:47:43.920 --> 02:47:49.840]  where uh 900 people were killed under questionable circumstances uh jim jones had a lot of cia ties
[02:47:49.840 --> 02:47:55.120]  they found tons of psychotropic drugs on the premises there they're being used to control these
[02:47:55.120 --> 02:48:02.400]  people the whole um embassy there in giana was a cia substation it wasn't there was no diplomatic
[02:48:02.400 --> 02:48:06.400]  personnel at all so it was obvious that there was some kind of cia operation going on with that
[02:48:07.120 --> 02:48:13.360]  dr jolly west worked on that he later worked on weco with the fbi advising them on how to treat
[02:48:13.360 --> 02:48:20.080]  the dividends we saw how that turned out then after the um the catastrophic fire dr jolly west is
[02:48:20.080 --> 02:48:25.600]  the go-to man for the media explaining to the american people why the dividends decided to
[02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:30.320]  kill themselves which of course was a lie they were murdered by the fbi uh after the bombing
[02:48:30.320 --> 02:48:35.200]  immediately after the bombing even before he was brought on to be the doctor for tim mcvey
[02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:41.600]  dr jolly west was flown here from california and actually uh mentioned by name by vice president
[02:48:41.600 --> 02:48:48.080]  al gore in a speech as soon as he got to oakland city as coming here to treat the victims but
[02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:53.680]  that's not all jolly west did here he was actually helping he was actually treating the first responders
[02:48:53.680 --> 02:48:59.680]  and fixing inconvenient memories we know this for a fact we have talked to first responders
[02:48:59.680 --> 02:49:04.560]  who have brought the federal mental health facilities and told to change their minds about
[02:49:04.560 --> 02:49:08.960]  the bombs they had seen inside the building that they had actually come that happened a bunch on
[02:49:08.960 --> 02:49:13.520]  nine eleven jolly west was working on that that happened at nine eleven at the pentagon they would
[02:49:13.520 --> 02:49:17.120]  take people and say you need to go to the hospital because of what you saw and then
[02:49:17.120 --> 02:49:22.480]  they would block blackout well they've got again devil's breath halcyon all of these
[02:49:22.480 --> 02:49:27.840]  but but again he's he's in congressional testimony as the second most famous mind control doctor
[02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:33.120]  in world history and then he's mcvey's doctor and nobody in the media points this out and now the
[02:49:33.120 --> 02:49:39.680]  new joker guy homes is obviously bombed out of his brain right now and no one's going to talk about
[02:49:39.680 --> 02:49:46.880]  that exactly and uh after mcvey was incarcerated dr jolly west actually had his protege dr
[02:49:46.880 --> 02:49:54.640]  john smith be tim mcvey's direct psychologist from day to day and dr john smith who was tim mcvey's
[02:49:54.640 --> 02:50:00.160]  psychologist or psychiatrist later turned out a couple years later to be chief of psychiatry at

[02:54:17.760 --> 02:54:29.440]  all right i'm going to shoot a special video of the nightly news tonight the errands doing really
[02:54:29.440 --> 02:54:35.600]  trying to condense all this new evidence together of this being a false flag here's why it's it's
[02:54:35.600 --> 02:54:39.600]  bad i wish the evidence didn't point towards a staged event but it's a it's a crew that's
[02:54:39.600 --> 02:54:45.680]  done it with oklahoma city and fast and furious it fits their mo it's in an area where they do it
[02:54:45.680 --> 02:54:51.760]  the suspect fits all the earmarks and i mean chillingly so uh you know drooling up there and
[02:54:51.760 --> 02:54:58.000]  giggling and snickering out of his mind drugged up on you know uh lucky charms or whatever and
[02:54:58.800 --> 02:55:03.520]  then you've got the fact that they want our guns and are going for them and the un treaty
[02:55:04.320 --> 02:55:10.640]  and the fact that it's going to boost obama's approval ratings just watch i pray that he's a
[02:55:10.640 --> 02:55:16.320]  lone nutcase but the open and shut way they're doing it the way they're never giving any details
[02:55:16.320 --> 02:55:20.800]  the way they're acting real suspicious all of this really stinks to high heaven christ
[02:55:20.800 --> 02:55:25.440]  emory we've only got about four or five minutes left in this interview but we're gonna i'm gonna
[02:55:25.440 --> 02:55:28.880]  have you guys back later this week to talk more about it it's so important because you've been so
[02:55:28.880 --> 02:55:36.000]  close to this but your final comments in this hour chris hold on we don't have you fade it up yet
[02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:42.640]  start out i look at it from the filmmaker's point of view just you have to really sweep away all of
[02:55:42.640 --> 02:55:46.960]  the the emotion and the melodrama and so forth and hey i know to some people that might sound cold
[02:55:46.960 --> 02:55:52.560]  but you have to look at the facts for what they are and immediately you get the the heat of the
[02:55:52.560 --> 02:55:57.520]  moment information who the witnesses were how many perps were involved obviously we've got witnesses
[02:55:57.520 --> 02:56:01.920]  saying there were more than in one person ordinance coming from different sides of theater
[02:56:01.920 --> 02:56:06.960]  you've got to collect the facts as soon as you can then you hire that independent set of investigators
[02:56:06.960 --> 02:56:11.360]  to look at it and here we've got the memorial in oklahoma city they're putting the flags that
[02:56:11.360 --> 02:56:15.920]  have staff well in a respect basis that's fine but they're they're taking this melodrama taking it
[02:56:15.920 --> 02:56:19.920]  to the next step and saying hey you know and the cool irony is that we had a government operatives
[02:56:19.920 --> 02:56:23.920]  do this in oklahoma city and it looks like you said all the earmarks of government operative
[02:56:23.920 --> 02:56:28.320]  doing this in colorado and they're they're throwing it right back in our face and that's
[02:56:28.320 --> 02:56:34.160]  absolutely disgusting it's unacceptable and we've got to take a stand it's we're not idiots
[02:56:34.160 --> 02:56:38.320]  and let's not give the government a reason to believe that we are look if you've if you've
[02:56:38.320 --> 02:56:43.360]  got a group caught doing something over and over again we would be idiots as you say if we didn't
[02:56:43.360 --> 02:56:50.640]  look at them as the number one suspects um comments on uh that holland yes i mean the number one
[02:56:50.640 --> 02:56:56.000]  suspect uh look at who benefits it certainly isn't the american people uh the only beneficiary of
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:57:01.840]  this attack is the federal government and those who are pushing for gun control the timing
[02:57:01.840 --> 02:57:06.960]  is uncanny it cannot be denied that this benefits the government and whenever people are attacked
[02:57:06.960 --> 02:57:12.160]  or they're scared there's a psychological reaction uh they cling to authority and they lash out at
[02:57:12.160 --> 02:57:17.280]  outsiders and in this case i do believe you're right alex that's the uh obama's poll numbers
[02:57:17.280 --> 02:57:23.680]  are going to rise and the fact that the designated outsider in this case is guns we're already seeing
[02:57:23.680 --> 02:57:27.360]  the articles i've already seen three or four and i haven't really been looking i just been
[02:57:27.360 --> 02:57:32.720]  floating around the internet and they're popping up of articles now pushing for gun control because
[02:57:32.720 --> 02:57:38.320]  of this shooting and frankly i hate to say it but i've been waiting not waiting but dreading when
[02:57:38.320 --> 02:57:43.440]  something like this would happen and we see the the convergence of events oh yeah we've got curious
[02:57:43.440 --> 02:57:49.600]  the gun ban treaty it cannot be denied well yeah we've got um all these people all over the news
[02:57:49.600 --> 02:57:54.800]  even rupert murdoch is saying time to restrict the guns that's up at info wars.com he said that
[02:57:54.800 --> 02:58:00.400]  on his twitter uh but look shirt off wants pre-crime spies everywhere this is an article
[02:58:00.400 --> 02:58:05.440]  in info wars.com by curtain demo and he says have see something say something spies everywhere
[02:58:05.440 --> 02:58:11.760]  well that's the new rollout tsa already has the psas made showing them in the malls and on the
[02:58:11.760 --> 02:58:17.040]  highways and now they're rolling out it's the rollout just like the underwear bomber happened
[02:58:17.040 --> 02:58:22.400]  one week before the machines were set to go in they claimed they ordered them that week they
[02:58:22.400 --> 02:58:27.120]  ordered them a year before it took that long to build them and it turned out the government got
[02:58:27.120 --> 02:58:31.680]  that guy on the plane and and of course a month and a half after we broke it it's like oh come on
[02:58:31.680 --> 02:58:36.960]  alex some stuff happens on its own earned out that was staged great job gentlemen we'll cover it all
[02:58:36.960 --> 02:58:50.320]  tonight on the nightly news a lot more at prison planet dot tv thank you thank you for listening to gcm visit gcm live.com today
