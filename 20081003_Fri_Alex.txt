[00:00.000 --> 00:14.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.040 --> 00:33.040]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones this is an incredibly
[00:33.040 --> 00:43.760]  important broadcast lined up for you today we have Congressman Brad Sherman joining us
[00:43.760 --> 00:53.160]  coming up later in the show today they are debating live on the house floor last night
[00:53.160 --> 01:02.240]  and this morning and last night he revealed what we had already gotten from two separate
[01:02.240 --> 01:09.280]  congressmen who said behind the scenes there had been discussions of martial law not just
[01:09.280 --> 01:23.200]  martial law in the congress and on the house rules basically where the leaders of the house
[01:23.200 --> 01:29.120]  and senate can break whatever rules they want and ram things through but literal martial
[01:29.120 --> 01:37.800]  law physical martial law and this goes on the heels of north com announcing in an interview
[01:37.800 --> 01:44.440]  in the army times officially that they want to bring army brigades in and is now activated
[01:44.440 --> 01:50.480]  October 1st one brigade and more brigades to be trained for civil unrest to use non-lethal
[01:50.480 --> 01:58.240]  weapons microwave guns sound cannons mainstream news give dictatorial sweeping powers those
[01:58.240 --> 02:02.840]  are the terms used by the Washington Post and others dictatorial sweeping to the treasury
[02:02.840 --> 02:08.920]  to buy sell do whatever they want this is economic martial law but the congress is being threatened
[02:08.920 --> 02:13.480]  that if they don't go along with this there will be physical martial law now remember
[02:13.480 --> 02:18.320]  a few months ago several congressmen when they were asked separately democrats on the
[02:18.320 --> 02:26.400]  east coast why aren't you being more aggressive in pushing for impeachment they said because
[02:26.400 --> 02:34.640]  martial law will be declared and the president will launch an attack on Iran is the pretext
[02:34.640 --> 02:40.640]  to do it so this is happening ladies and gentlemen they are seriously considering ending the
[02:40.640 --> 02:45.920]  republic dictatorship flat out and don't think for a minute that they can't pull this after
[02:45.920 --> 02:52.960]  john mccain or barack obama is in there these men are total fronts for the very same institutions
[02:52.960 --> 02:57.280]  and they're identical on all the real policies all the public is watching that ridiculous
[02:57.280 --> 03:02.520]  scripted non-debate last night with talking points repeated like parrots over and over
[03:02.520 --> 03:09.480]  again by those two establishment parrots the real world is going to hate ease in a hand
[03:09.480 --> 03:17.400]  basket as they say when we get back we're going to play the clip of congressman brand
[03:17.400 --> 03:22.280]  sherman martial law and go over some of the current developments here and then go over
[03:22.280 --> 03:26.520]  the back story that's key and we have several other guest i'll tell you about after the
[03:26.520 --> 03:32.840]  break as well that are coming up today not just the congressman by the way trade i want

[04:25.560 --> 04:33.000]  of the liberty movement he needs to comment they say you can't predict the stock market

[07:35.200 --> 07:40.520]  Jones show because there's a war on for your mind.
[07:40.520 --> 07:54.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, one of the most important broadcasts we've ever
[07:54.000 --> 08:01.560]  done is now taking place. Previously, going back over a decade, I would maybe
[08:01.560 --> 08:06.080]  say that once a year or so, always in progression, things getting more serious.
[08:06.080 --> 08:09.800]  Now every few weeks I come on there and say that and it's because everything
[08:09.800 --> 08:15.920]  just intensifies. Everything is getting more and more serious by the minute. We
[08:15.920 --> 08:22.040]  have seen the unbelievable financial terrorism, the financial 9-11 of the
[08:22.040 --> 08:27.080]  White House, the Treasury Secretary, the Speaker of the House, the leader of the
[08:27.080 --> 08:32.400]  Senate, both parties out saying, John McCain saying, pass the bailout bill or
[08:32.400 --> 08:36.200]  there will be a depression and then we watch the controlled stock market
[08:36.200 --> 08:40.720]  through the president's working group on financial markets known as the Plunge
[08:40.720 --> 08:47.000]  Protection Team, not dump money in five days ago on Monday when the banker
[08:47.000 --> 08:51.480]  takeover bill, the economic martial law bill, and that's what it really is, in
[08:51.480 --> 08:57.080]  clear black and white, did not pass. And when it didn't, they did not prop the
[08:57.080 --> 09:01.120]  stock market up. They prop it up every day with tens of billions and in some
[09:01.120 --> 09:05.480]  cases hundreds of billions of liquidity and government agencies buying
[09:05.480 --> 09:12.000]  stocks and engaging all sorts of manipulation. Now the banker takeover
[09:12.000 --> 09:16.560]  bill codifies that into law, gives them total immunity and absolute power above
[09:16.560 --> 09:21.640]  and beyond the Congress and even the president. It is unbelievable and people
[09:21.640 --> 09:25.040]  keep thinking, we've had guests on who kept thinking over the last couple weeks,
[09:25.040 --> 09:27.920]  oh they're going to take this provision out where it says the Treasury
[09:27.920 --> 09:32.360]  Secretary is non-reviewable by any branch of government or by any court of law or
[09:32.360 --> 09:38.360]  any police agency. Well guess what? I've got multiple mainstream reports today
[09:38.360 --> 09:43.280]  who've analyzed it and even they're saying there's more powers in here than
[09:43.280 --> 09:47.840]  what was previously in it. This is a complete and total takeover so make no
[09:47.840 --> 09:53.920]  mistake, this is economic martial law. The president can sign PDD-51 saying
[09:53.920 --> 09:58.080]  he's a dictator, saying whoever comes later is president's a dictator. He can
[09:58.080 --> 10:01.040]  sign the John Warner Defense Authorization Act to put battle-hardened
[10:01.040 --> 10:04.440]  Uber Gaines under Homeland Command in the U.S. against the American people two
[10:04.440 --> 10:08.720]  years ago and now it's happening. They can do all of this but they still want the
[10:08.720 --> 10:14.760]  acquiescence of Congress, at least on paper, to say see they signed over totally
[10:14.760 --> 10:20.840]  unconstitutional criminal power, that's what it is, to the Treasury and the
[10:20.840 --> 10:24.280]  private bankers that run it. So this is the Federal Reserve basically taking over
[10:24.280 --> 10:29.240]  the Treasury Department fully. They already engage in manipulation, insider
[10:29.240 --> 10:32.560]  trading and all sorts of corruption with our tax money through the banking system.
[10:32.560 --> 10:37.640]  But now and in this new bill it has unlimited fractional reserve banking.
[10:37.640 --> 10:46.040]  Let me explain. We got into trouble with the 10 to 1 rule. For every dollar in a
[10:46.040 --> 10:50.600]  bank they can loan out 10 that don't exist because they could then set up
[10:50.600 --> 10:55.600]  subsidiaries and leverage out to infinity. Now in the bill, in the subsections, it
[10:55.600 --> 11:03.000]  clearly states unlimited. They can just make up whatever they want, any amount of
[11:03.000 --> 11:07.640]  fiat money and give that to any private institution they wish or buy anything
[11:07.640 --> 11:14.240]  they wish from themselves. Total conflict of interest with this small
[11:14.240 --> 11:18.680]  intergroup of private Federal Reserve owning bankers who own the 12 member
[11:18.680 --> 11:21.520]  banks, which is owned by the Bank of England. And that's why you see the
[11:21.520 --> 11:24.800]  British News and that's why you see Gordon Brown, the Prime Minister, that's why
[11:24.800 --> 11:29.160]  you see German and the French leaders saying it's the end, it's the end, global
[11:29.160 --> 11:33.280]  depression, road warrior scenario. They're all saying that they even use that term.
[11:33.280 --> 11:39.280]  I don't know who started using that decades ago but it's now in popular use.
[11:39.280 --> 11:43.280]  They're saying road warrior scenario, total breakdown of society, it's all over
[11:43.280 --> 11:47.320]  the news unless you give the international banks total control. And so now the
[11:47.320 --> 11:50.400]  private banks will become the government not just be separate from the
[11:50.400 --> 11:53.920]  government issuing the currency and credit. They are taking over, they already
[11:53.920 --> 11:58.520]  took over in Europe and England a long time ago, they are taking over everything
[11:58.520 --> 12:02.200]  and now they're going to put carbon taxes on us. I told you as it's in the club
[12:02.200 --> 12:05.760]  of Rome and the CFR and the Bilderberg minutes and the documents and the
[12:05.760 --> 12:10.840]  eyewitnesses and the IMF and World Bank documents that they want to have global
[12:10.840 --> 12:15.240]  carbon taxes you pay to the private global central banks and guess what?
[12:15.240 --> 12:23.720]  That's in the bill. That's up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com right now.
[12:23.720 --> 12:30.760]  Do you understand what is happening here? Everything we told you exactly as we
[12:30.760 --> 12:41.480]  said it would take place. Now, even in our own liberty movement with the few
[12:41.480 --> 12:48.280]  hundred financial analysts and economists and people, the majority of them admit
[12:48.280 --> 12:51.000]  that the private central banks because their documents are public wanted to
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.680]  engineer collapse but they are saying, oh, but they've lost control of this. A
[12:54.680 --> 13:00.840]  minority of us see clearly that they haven't. This is planned. Again, we came
[13:00.840 --> 13:04.160]  and told you two and a half years ago, a year before the subprime thing even
[13:04.160 --> 13:06.840]  started, that they were going to implode it starting with that. That wasn't an
[13:06.840 --> 13:12.040]  accident and we're not prescient, we're not giving you revelation here, ladies
[13:12.040 --> 13:17.120]  and gentlemen, divine revelation. We had moles inside and put it in articles and
[13:17.120 --> 13:22.400]  on video on record. You cannot argue with it. It's premeditated. We have the IMF
[13:22.400 --> 13:25.160]  and World Bank documents. Keep telling you that's a big deal every day on the
[13:25.160 --> 13:28.280]  show for six years since we got them because they said they're planning it
[13:28.280 --> 13:32.000]  here. The same stuff they've done in the third world. Take over the government,
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.840]  run up the debt, implode it and everything over to the bankers. End of huge
[13:35.840 --> 13:41.280]  middle classes. In first world nations, the only first world nation in South
[13:41.280 --> 13:48.000]  America and Central America was Argentina. No longer. Total third world. Brazil was
[13:48.000 --> 13:52.080]  approaching first world and got knocked down a third world by these people. All
[13:52.080 --> 13:58.960]  by design, all on the record. Then they tell you that the economy's fine. They
[13:58.960 --> 14:02.280]  lie to you while they get everybody more leverage in the debt and then they
[14:02.280 --> 14:04.800]  suddenly pull the trigger and say, depression, depression, depression.
[14:04.800 --> 14:12.280]  Knowing that that would then kill the markets and create total and complete
[14:12.280 --> 14:17.120]  non-trust of the people and that all confidence would be lost. It's over. It's
[14:17.120 --> 14:21.600]  over. You understand? They just need to get these new powers and it's over. They're
[14:21.600 --> 14:25.560]  going to pull the plug completely. When they pass that bailout, ladies and
[14:25.560 --> 14:30.480]  gentlemen, it is a death sentence within two months. Maybe longer but I doubt it.
[14:30.480 --> 14:37.160]  It may even be days. When they have that done and when that is completed, that is
[14:37.160 --> 14:43.680]  it. You understand? The equivalent of financial Armageddon. The missiles, the
[14:43.680 --> 14:48.000]  financial missiles, the figurative missiles to annihilate the middle class
[14:48.000 --> 14:54.240]  of the planet in Western Europe, Japan, the United States, Australia, Canada. It's
[14:54.240 --> 15:01.200]  gone. It's over. They've created hundreds and hundreds of times fiat debt that
[15:01.200 --> 15:05.560]  they call currency above all the real assets. Do you understand? When they get
[15:05.560 --> 15:09.240]  the power, once they have the total financial takeover of the US, they've
[15:09.240 --> 15:12.640]  already got Europe. That's why you see all the bankers globally behind this
[15:12.640 --> 15:16.040]  because they're all owned by the same sickening degenerate Saxe-Coburg
[15:16.040 --> 15:21.360]  gothers, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers who openly own the stock in
[15:21.360 --> 15:26.160]  these central banks. They are taking over the financial system, the stocks, the
[15:26.160 --> 15:30.720]  pension funds. They are taking it all. Do you read me and they're going to hit you
[15:30.720 --> 15:38.640]  with unbelievable hyperinflation while there is depression and a contraction?
[15:38.640 --> 15:43.280]  You're going to have what I am coining, not stagflation where you just have
[15:43.280 --> 15:49.600]  markets contracting and sales imploding and some joblessness and then inflation.
[15:49.600 --> 16:02.520]  You're going to have hyperinflationary stagflation. Hyper stagflation. Hyper
[16:02.520 --> 16:08.800]  stagflation. You get the term right. It's hyper stagflation. I've been having an
[16:08.800 --> 16:11.840]  economist on the last week saying, is that a good term? That's a perfect term.
[16:11.840 --> 16:19.580]  This is hyper stagflation. This is mega hyper stagflation. You're not going to
[16:19.580 --> 16:23.400]  have jobs. You're not going to be able to get money even as it takes three, four,
[16:23.400 --> 16:27.440]  five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred times more money to buy stuff.
[16:27.440 --> 16:35.480]  You read me, ladies and gentlemen, hyperinflation is devastating even when
[16:35.480 --> 16:39.720]  that people got money in the streets and suddenly you're not
[16:39.720 --> 16:43.160]  paying $30,000 a year. You're paid $100,000 because of inflation. You're
[16:43.160 --> 16:47.400]  not paid $100,000. You're paid a million dollars a year. But you can't buy what
[16:47.400 --> 16:51.440]  you need with it. No, you're not going to be able to have the paper. You're not
[16:51.440 --> 16:57.400]  going to have the credit and they're going to be inflighting prices. You got me?
[16:59.400 --> 17:04.480]  Inflation is at over 15% a year right now and because there's been so much
[17:04.480 --> 17:08.920]  depression in the real economy and on Main Street, that's actually held some of
[17:08.920 --> 17:11.880]  the commodities down a little bit because there's a big demand for fuel.
[17:11.880 --> 17:19.440]  People don't have money to buy gold. People don't have money to buy silver. But
[17:19.440 --> 17:24.600]  that equation is now shifting. Now, here's the big news. It's up on infowars.com.
[17:24.600 --> 17:31.500]  Martial law will be declared if banker bailout not passed. Infowars.com
[17:32.000 --> 17:37.360]  In house debate on the banker rescue bill, Representative Brad Sherman told his
[17:37.360 --> 17:40.840]  fellow Congress critters that the government will declare martial law and
[17:40.840 --> 17:49.880]  the stock market will drop 3,000 points if the bill is not passed. The panic
[17:49.880 --> 17:53.520]  mongers were to the point of telling people the market would drop 3,000
[17:53.520 --> 17:58.400]  points and there would be martial law, said Sherman. Sherman's comment was not
[17:58.400 --> 18:02.360]  in the same context as the comment issued by Representative Michael Burgess, who
[18:02.360 --> 18:05.920]  we interviewed on Monday earlier in the week. Burgess will appear on the Alex
[18:05.920 --> 18:14.160]  Jones show, said Pelosi threatened to invoke House rule 13-6-A described as
[18:14.160 --> 18:17.680]  martial law intended to suspend normal procedures and safeguards, and that's
[18:17.680 --> 18:21.040]  all the house leadership to operate in a more authoritarian fashion. Sherman,
[18:21.040 --> 18:24.520]  however, said martial law would be declared on Wall Street, not in the
[18:24.520 --> 18:27.920]  house. And we've talked to his office. They confirmed it. He's coming on later.
[18:27.920 --> 18:31.080]  They're debating right now, but he's going to run in for about 20 minutes with us
[18:31.080 --> 18:36.560]  in between debate. Representative Sherman said the exaggerated fear-mongering
[18:36.560 --> 18:41.160]  turned out not to be true and the house can draft a good bill regardless of the
[18:41.160 --> 18:44.800]  pressure put on representatives to pass the banker bailout bill. The bailout
[18:44.800 --> 18:51.240]  plan is not only economic fascism, as Richard Vigory has correctly noted,
[18:51.240 --> 18:55.040]  designed to loop the US Treasury and reorganize further consolidated elite
[18:55.040 --> 18:58.960]  control over the economy, but it's also a brazen effort to impose a martial law
[18:58.960 --> 19:02.800]  dictatorship. Paulson's role as financial dictator, not answerable to
[19:02.800 --> 19:06.400]  Congress and the American people, fully complements additional steps taken over
[19:06.400 --> 19:12.520]  the last few years. Then Curt Nimo goes through it all. Let's call Hamburg, former
[19:12.520 --> 19:16.400]  Congressman Hamburg. He's been warning about this in 2007 in the San
[19:16.400 --> 19:21.080]  Francisco Chronicle about their plan for martial law. When we come back, I'm going to
[19:21.080 --> 19:26.680]  play the clip, finish up the article. This is a absolute highest level alert. Get
[19:26.680 --> 19:30.560]  this out to everyone now so they know what's really happening. Full-scale

[20:32.360 --> 20:37.120]  other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against
[20:37.120 --> 20:41.840]  this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[20:41.840 --> 20:46.160]  bin Laden. This is his ammo. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to
[20:46.160 --> 20:50.720]  Osama bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at
[20:50.720 --> 20:54.840]  the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some
[20:54.840 --> 20:58.740]  U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in
[20:58.740 --> 21:04.360]  spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been
[21:04.360 --> 21:09.160]  detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the
[21:09.160 --> 21:12.800]  Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war
[21:12.800 --> 21:17.480]  games, the shadow government, and much much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at

[21:30.320 --> 21:34.240]  Hello Ted Anderson. Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal
[21:34.240 --> 21:37.920]  Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending. Therefore with
[21:37.920 --> 21:41.640]  catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently
[21:41.640 --> 21:44.580]  placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their
[21:44.580 --> 21:48.320]  accounts. A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your
[21:48.320 --> 21:51.720]  deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal. Deficit spending will
[21:51.720 --> 21:55.680]  skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a
[21:55.680 --> 22:00.000]  bank run followed by a depressed economy. A current effort is underway by the Fed
[22:00.000 --> 22:03.440]  along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[22:03.440 --> 22:07.320]  However an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity
[22:07.320 --> 22:11.680]  can cause inflation. In order to achieve strength and stability I recommend a
[22:11.680 --> 22:16.120]  conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and
[22:16.120 --> 22:20.800]  silver. While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own
[22:20.800 --> 22:26.920]  has held value for over 6,000 years. For more information call 1-800-686-2237
[22:26.920 --> 22:30.320]  that's 1-800-686-2237.

[23:35.360 --> 23:41.960]  Continuing with the article by Kurt Nemo. Even people on our own movement don't
[23:41.960 --> 23:46.080]  understand this is completely engineered. They love to think of the elitist
[23:46.080 --> 23:51.800]  bumbling the thunes. No ladies and gentlemen they've created genetically
[23:51.800 --> 23:56.320]  engineered crops to take over all the other major food lines and infect the
[23:56.320 --> 23:59.880]  entire biosphere to develop weapons where they can shoot missiles down your
[23:59.880 --> 24:03.760]  chimney and kill your family. They control the central banking system. They got
[24:03.760 --> 24:09.960]  control of the world in a huge fight between all the hundreds of thousands
[24:09.960 --> 24:14.120]  of tyrants and thugs throughout modern history. They are the New World Order and
[24:14.120 --> 24:17.960]  they are engineering this in their own words. They have been preparing for
[24:17.960 --> 24:21.960]  martial law for economic martial law. They have been gearing up. They have been
[24:21.960 --> 24:27.560]  quietly paying off local politicians. This ladies and gentlemen is happening.
[24:27.560 --> 24:32.120]  Let's just go ahead and play the video. The audio here on air for everybody. The
[24:32.120 --> 24:37.880]  video is up on infowars.com. This is representative Brad Sherman about
[24:37.880 --> 24:42.240]  physical martial law. They were threatened with martial law Monday if they
[24:42.240 --> 24:47.760]  didn't pass the bailout plan. See financial terrorism. We're gonna have a
[24:47.760 --> 24:51.280]  depression and there's gonna be martial law if you don't pass this and they
[24:51.280 --> 24:55.800]  blinked on the globalists. The Congress didn't blink and the globalists blinked
[24:55.800 --> 25:00.640]  and backed off. Now they've had time to terrorize the public for another four
[25:00.640 --> 25:05.600]  or five days. To have both parties tell you you've got to do this and it isn't
[25:05.600 --> 25:09.080]  about the 800 billion that's really five trillion. First it's 700 now 800 now
[25:09.080 --> 25:15.160]  they're saying five trillion. It's the unlimited power that the bankers get. Go
[25:15.160 --> 25:19.720]  ahead and play the clip. This is last night during debate. This is last night
[25:19.720 --> 25:22.640]  and this is still going on. Similar comments this morning are coming in.
[25:22.640 --> 25:28.920]  Here it is. City from Ohio. The only way they can pass this bill is by creating
[25:28.920 --> 25:35.720]  and sustaining a panic atmosphere. That atmosphere is not justified. Many of us
[25:35.720 --> 25:41.160]  were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday
[25:41.160 --> 25:46.520]  that the sky would fall, the market would drop two or three thousand points the
[25:46.520 --> 25:50.480]  first day, another couple thousand the second day, and a few members were even
[25:50.480 --> 25:56.720]  told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no. That's what I
[25:56.720 --> 26:03.080]  call fear mongering. Unjustified. Proven wrong. We've got a week. We've got two
[26:03.080 --> 26:08.000]  weeks to write a good bill. The only way to write to pass a bad bill, keep the
[26:08.000 --> 26:14.040]  panic pressure on. Now what has the Senate done to this bill? Now ladies and
[26:14.040 --> 26:19.600]  gentlemen, they fear mongered and said you never see big officials say this.
[26:19.600 --> 26:24.240]  Ever. Never. They said there will be a depression and one trillion two hundred
[26:24.240 --> 26:31.800]  plus billion, 1.23. One trillion two hundred billion point three was lost in
[26:31.800 --> 26:38.040]  two hours after the no vote before the stock exchange closed on the Dow Jones
[26:38.040 --> 26:45.880]  alone. It's incalculable the other markets around the world and the other
[26:45.880 --> 26:55.720]  indexes. Now that is terrorism of the highest order. Ladies and gentlemen, that
[26:55.720 --> 27:02.840]  is close to half the money spent in the Iraq war. That is close to half the GDP
[27:02.840 --> 27:12.800]  gross domestic product of the country in a year. Gone! And then these bastards sit
[27:12.800 --> 27:19.200]  up there and tell you they're your savior and give them unlimited power. A lot
[27:19.200 --> 27:22.280]  of you denied they carried out 9-11. You couldn't deal with that. You couldn't
[27:22.280 --> 27:26.880]  face it. They'll kill 3,000 of us and they'll steal a trillion two. They'll
[27:26.880 --> 27:32.280]  burn it down in front of you just to scare you. And it hasn't gained hardly
[27:32.280 --> 27:39.080]  any of that back. Now if they pass this and they get these economic powers,
[27:39.080 --> 27:43.520]  they're gonna pump things up for a few months, maybe even six months, and then
[27:43.520 --> 27:47.960]  they are going to completely enslave everybody. In fact, they don't even care
[27:47.960 --> 27:50.280]  right now. They're going for broke. They're not even hiding it. They'll
[27:50.280 --> 27:54.320]  probably pass it and have a depression two weeks later and then
[27:54.320 --> 27:56.840]  they'll say it isn't a depression. They'll go back and say everything's great
[27:56.840 --> 28:01.080]  while everybody's rioting and starving in the streets. What are you gonna do
[28:01.080 --> 28:04.160]  police when people are rioting and starving and then your mama's calling
[28:04.160 --> 28:11.040]  from a state over or a city nearby begging you to come help her? You're
[28:11.040 --> 28:14.360]  gonna leave. You're gonna go help your mama or maybe you won't. Maybe like
[28:14.360 --> 28:18.920]  Rashard, the head of the county that the parish that New Orleans is in, the
[28:18.920 --> 28:22.720]  feds told him to stand down for five days while his mama called him. Did that
[28:22.720 --> 28:28.040]  clip up? It's Rashard. I forget. It was like three years ago. I forget the name
[28:28.040 --> 28:32.200]  of the exact clip, but we played it a lot. Just see if you can, John. I can find him
[28:32.200 --> 28:40.960]  on Google. Paris Sheriff talks about lack of federal aid or something like that.
[28:40.960 --> 28:44.800]  Him crying on Good Morning America saying the feds held him back and mama
[28:44.800 --> 28:48.320]  called and said, honey, there's water in here. I'm in the nursing home. There's no
[28:48.320 --> 28:53.000]  food. There's no power. Help me. They said, I'm coming mama. I'm coming. And the
[28:53.000 --> 28:55.680]  feds said he couldn't go help her. And the next day, I'm gonna follow my orders.
[28:55.680 --> 28:59.040]  Mama, I'm coming. I'm coming. The next day, mama, I'm coming. Mama, I'm coming.
[28:59.040 --> 29:02.840]  The feds said, no, he couldn't go help her. And then on the fourth day, mama, I'm
[29:02.840 --> 29:07.080]  coming. Mama, I'm coming. I'm gonna help you. On the fifth day, mama was dead.
[29:07.080 --> 29:13.080]  Just remember that police. Just remember. And I know your black uniform is more
[29:13.080 --> 29:23.880]  important than your mama. I know you're evil. We're on the march. The Empire's on

[35:06.280 --> 35:21.280]  Come on today to comment on this martial law development. Open discussions, Congress people being told physical martial law will be declared if they don't sign over financial martial law powers to the private bankers through Secretary
[35:21.280 --> 35:42.280]  Creminal Paulson and he said he'll probably be able to get Ron Paul. The debate is going on now. If they can do it, Ron Paul is coming up. Then we've got Paul Craig Roberts in 54 minutes coming on. We've got former Congressman Dan Hamburg who predicted all of this last year in the San Francisco Chronicle with a detailed report.
[35:42.280 --> 35:54.280]  We're linked to up in infowars.com and presidentbundle.com and Curtin M.O. Story and then the big one, Congressman Brad Sherman. We're going to find out exactly who told him for this martial law.
[35:54.280 --> 36:08.280]  Oh my God. I mean this is insane. I mean so much is happening. Go ahead and play the Brad Sherman Club again for people that don't have computer that can't go to infowars.com and watch the video of it.
[36:08.280 --> 36:13.280]  Here's the audio today.
[36:38.280 --> 36:56.280]  It could be martial law in America if we voted no. That's what I call fear mongering, unjustified, proven wrong. We've got a week. We've got two weeks to write a good bill. The only way to write to pass a bad bill, keep the panic pressure on.
[36:56.280 --> 37:08.280]  Now what has the Senate done to this bill? And then he goes into hell and hands dictatorial power over to the private treasury and it's basically private. It operates as a private operation with the private Federal Reserve.
[37:08.280 --> 37:26.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is red level. They are creating a false threat with the economy, terrorizing the world markets, a trillion, two hundred billion and change, lost in one day from their terrorism. They're engaged in the same terrorism all week driving world markets down.
[37:26.280 --> 37:41.280]  Other congressmen on record have said they've been threatened with martial law. If they try to impeach, if they say no to this, it's all on record. There's so many accounts of this, we can't even, in this morning, putting the story together, add them all in there. Physically write them all down. There's too many.
[37:41.280 --> 37:56.280]  We need our volunteers to go into the prison planet forum and find all the mainstream articles, all the other congressmen. Who were the two? It was earlier this year. With all this craziness going on, I only had five minutes this morning to look for it because I was working on some other stuff.
[37:56.280 --> 38:10.280]  Because I want to add it to Nemo's story. There were two East Coast congressmen and people would go to their public rallies and there's video of it and audio and the congressman was asked, why aren't you going for impeachment? And two separate congressmen said, because we've been threatened with martial law if we do.
[38:10.280 --> 38:14.280]  They'll launch an attack on Iran as a pretext for martial law.
[38:14.280 --> 38:30.280]  I mean, this is it, ladies and gentlemen. We need to create a real panic. People should be panicked over this. Panicked calling Congress. Panicked calling the White House. Panicked calling the news media. Acting like this is a big deal. Not just calmly taking it.
[38:30.280 --> 38:47.280]  See, they use our normal instinct to stand up and fight back against us and they say, you better panic and go for total dictatorship, financial power, for the Treasury and the private fellow reserve, or you're going to lose everything. That is an incredible crime.
[38:47.280 --> 39:02.280]  What we're saying is, no, stop saying the emergency is that bad. Stop worsening it. Stop trying to get dictatorial powers by destroying the markets. Things could still probably be fixed. All the economists we've had on have said that.
[39:02.280 --> 39:10.280]  But what they're doing is the opposite. We'll only make it worse. They know that. They're bankrupting everything on purpose.
[39:10.280 --> 39:24.280]  We are at the key crossroads right now. I need this story on infowars.com and I need more detailed ones on prisonplanet.com to go mega viral like it never has before.
[39:24.280 --> 39:40.280]  And I need my web people, my IT guys to stay on the servers because I know they're smoking right now. We have to keep infowars.com and prisonplanet.com up. We've been getting so much traffic. We've had all sorts of problems the last few weeks as this intensifies.
[39:40.280 --> 39:51.280]  That's why I've tried to beef up our servers before this came. That's why I've been trying to get more servers. We can't screw around. You understand we are entering the danger zone right now.
[39:51.280 --> 40:00.280]  I want to settle down and reconvene my thoughts here and go through everything that's happening and talk about what we're currently witnessing in a calm fashion.
[40:00.280 --> 40:09.280]  Speaking of the devil, pull up danger zone for me, corny 80 song, but I think it says it all. Cue up danger zone for me, Johnny. Take a couple minute break here. I just can't.
[40:09.280 --> 40:22.280]  I'm starting to hyperventilate because I know how real this is. I have a guardian spirit. I have a mindset of guardianship.
[40:22.280 --> 40:45.280]  Driving into work this morning, I saw women pushing their baby carriages, going up to the bus stops, taking them to daycare to work. In the past, say 10 years ago, I'd look at a beautiful woman or something and think, man, she's a good looking and you'll be lustful.
[40:45.280 --> 40:58.280]  And then in the last 10 years or so, I just got to where I admired beautiful women and people. And now I just look at men and women and children and everybody and just my heart literally burns with love.
[40:58.280 --> 41:05.280]  And I just want to protect them. And I don't even hate them because they're ignorant and silly and don't know what's going on. I've been brainwashed and spurred.
[41:05.280 --> 41:19.280]  And I just burned with passion to warn them and to save them and to help them. And I don't have the strength to do it. And that's why I blow up on air because I'm not even the way I was three or four years ago, folks.
[41:19.280 --> 41:31.280]  I don't even think about sex anymore. I don't even think about food anymore, hardly. I don't even think about anything but fighting the New World Order. That's all I think about. That's all I do. That's all I am.
[41:31.280 --> 41:40.280]  I see the evil. My mind's constantly working. I know the angles. I look at the simplest things and see five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten layers of depth into them.
[41:40.280 --> 41:48.280]  I've got incredible discernment now. It just gets more intense all the time and I don't have the intellect to even articulate it.
[41:48.280 --> 42:00.280]  I just know that it's horrible. It's real martial law, FEMA camps, death. And I look at all these good people and I want to save them, not just my family.
[42:00.280 --> 42:13.280]  I want to save those women with those babies. I want to save these dumb cops. I want to save these dumb low-level bankers and minions and city council people that think they're part of the elite and don't know they're getting set up to be taken down.
[42:13.280 --> 42:24.280]  I don't know how to... I don't know why I'm even talking about myself and my mindset. I just wish other people burned with the same passion and the same brotherly love.
[42:24.280 --> 42:33.280]  Now, I don't want to play that song, actually. Let's play part of it and then we'll get top-ranking. I want to play top-ranking.
[42:33.280 --> 42:41.280]  Because liberal, conservative, black, white, old, young, everybody, we've got to drop all of it. We've got to get serious and focused and positive.
[42:41.280 --> 42:49.280]  And positive means admitting how bad things are so we can fix it, not this new-age positive stuff of denying what's going on and magical thinking.
[42:49.280 --> 42:56.280]  That isn't going to dig us out of this. We've got to get fired up and focused and take action and beat these people.
[42:56.280 --> 43:05.280]  Because the bare minimum they're going to take everything you've got and make you dispossess people like in Argentina or Nigeria.
[43:05.280 --> 43:15.280]  And let me tell you, it's a horrible prison economy. They're going to set up a predatory thing that makes all the tasering and deaths and millions in prison look like nothing.
[43:15.280 --> 43:20.280]  Here it is. Top-ranking.
[43:46.280 --> 43:49.280]  Keep on killing one another.
[43:49.280 --> 43:51.280]  Top-ranking.
[43:52.280 --> 43:54.280]  Top-ranking.
[43:55.280 --> 43:57.280]  Oh, you scoundrel.
[43:58.280 --> 43:59.280]  Scoundrel.
[43:59.280 --> 44:01.280]  Oh, you scoundrel.
[44:01.280 --> 44:02.280]  Scoundrel.
[44:02.280 --> 44:03.280]  Scoundrel.
[44:03.280 --> 44:05.280]  Oh, top-ranking.
[44:06.280 --> 44:08.280]  Oh, did you mean what you said?
[44:09.280 --> 44:11.280]  Oh, you.
[44:11.280 --> 44:12.280]  Oh, you.
[44:12.280 --> 44:13.280]  Oh, you.
[44:13.280 --> 44:15.280]  Oh, you.
[44:15.280 --> 44:16.280]  Lord of Dunes.
[44:17.280 --> 44:29.280]  They say the blood runs, and it runs through our liars, along the whores of Martin Dan.
[44:33.280 --> 44:40.280]  And John saw them come from, oh with the truth.
[44:40.280 --> 44:52.280]  I'm an ancient man, the brother-in-law, the sister-in-law, the sister-in-law.
[44:52.280 --> 45:03.280]  I feel this morning, I feel this morning, brother-in-law, brother-in-law.
[45:03.280 --> 45:12.280]  The sister-in-law, the sister-in-law, I feel this morning, this morning.
[45:12.280 --> 45:14.280]  I feel that love this morning.
[45:14.280 --> 45:19.280]  They don't want us to unite.
[45:22.280 --> 45:28.280]  All they want us to do is keep on fucking it.
[45:28.280 --> 45:36.280]  They don't want to see us live together.
[45:36.280 --> 45:43.280]  All they want us to do is keep on killing one another.
[45:43.280 --> 45:59.280]  The rise against the new world order.
[45:59.280 --> 46:01.280]  Turn on the light.
[46:01.280 --> 46:05.280]  Push the darkness from the room.
[46:05.280 --> 46:09.280]  But only you can flip on that light switch.
[46:09.280 --> 46:14.280]  It's within your grasp.
[46:14.280 --> 46:18.280]  And make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the danger zone.
[46:18.280 --> 46:42.280]  Here it is, realize it, and hey, closer to the edge, the higher the intensity, here it is.
[46:42.280 --> 46:48.280]  Rather than to bend, listen to her howl and roar.
[46:48.280 --> 46:54.280]  Rather than to dance, she's making you the dancing girl.
[46:54.280 --> 46:58.280]  I went to love and sound.
[46:58.280 --> 47:01.280]  You are witnessing history.
[47:01.280 --> 47:04.280]  We are at the crossroads.
[47:04.280 --> 47:06.280]  Stand and be counted.
[47:06.280 --> 47:08.280]  Don't sit on the sidelines.
[47:08.280 --> 47:10.280]  Resist the pirates.
[47:10.280 --> 47:13.280]  Spread out wings.
[47:13.280 --> 47:16.280]  Spread out your wings and soar.
[47:16.280 --> 47:19.280]  Shove it in the overdrive.
[47:19.280 --> 47:21.280]  Shove it in the overdrive.
[47:21.280 --> 47:48.280]  I went to love and sound.
[47:48.280 --> 47:52.280]  You don't know what you can do until you get on that edge.
[47:52.280 --> 47:57.280]  Whether you like it or not, we're all on the edge.
[47:57.280 --> 48:00.280]  Heaven above us, hell below.
[48:00.280 --> 48:13.280]  The choice is yours.
[48:13.280 --> 48:17.280]  You can break your conditioning.
[48:17.280 --> 48:26.280]  You can break the spell of the new world order.
[48:26.280 --> 48:29.280]  Make no mistake, it's spiritual.
[48:29.280 --> 48:58.280]  I went to the danger zone.
[48:58.280 --> 49:01.280]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, coming up.
[49:01.280 --> 49:03.280]  Ron Paul, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[49:03.280 --> 49:08.280]  Congressman Dan Hanberg, Congressman Brad Sherman.
[49:08.280 --> 49:11.280]  They are threatening Congress with martial law.
[49:11.280 --> 49:13.280]  The last time they wouldn't pass the Patriot Act,
[49:13.280 --> 49:17.280]  the White House hit them with an anthrax attack.
[49:17.280 --> 49:22.280]  Pray for Congress.
[49:22.280 --> 49:27.280]  And even if they're able to pass this banker takeover bill,
[49:27.280 --> 49:30.280]  we can still expose who are the culprits,
[49:30.280 --> 49:32.280]  who carried out the financial terrorism
[49:32.280 --> 49:34.280]  they did in front of everybody.
[49:34.280 --> 49:37.280]  If you let your voices be heard now on talk radio,
[49:37.280 --> 49:41.280]  the internet, letters to the editor, calls to the media,
[49:41.280 --> 49:45.280]  signs on the streets by going and getting the stories
[49:45.280 --> 49:48.280]  up on infowars.com and prisonquanted.com
[49:48.280 --> 49:50.280]  and getting it out to everybody aggressively.
[49:50.280 --> 49:53.280]  This can become the biggest story on the internet,
[49:53.280 --> 49:55.280]  breaking into the mainstream media,
[49:55.280 --> 49:57.280]  breaking into the mass investigations,
[49:57.280 --> 49:59.280]  and it will come out that they are threatening
[49:59.280 --> 50:00.280]  and preparing martial law.
[50:00.280 --> 50:02.280]  We have got to defend the gates
[50:02.280 --> 50:07.280]  as the enemy comes against us right now.
[50:07.280 --> 50:10.280]  This is it.
[50:10.280 --> 50:14.280]  This is the beginning of a real war.
[50:14.280 --> 50:16.280]  All our labor, warning people.
[50:16.280 --> 50:19.280]  All our labor, telling people who the real enemy is.
[50:19.280 --> 50:22.280]  All our labor, exposing the enemy.
[50:22.280 --> 50:25.280]  The coming months and days will be brought to the test.

[50:36.280 --> 50:39.280]  With your child going to college or moving out on their own,
[50:39.280 --> 50:41.280]  it's important to keep these safety tips in mind.
[50:41.280 --> 50:44.280]  Teach them to be aware of their surroundings.
[50:44.280 --> 50:46.280]  Walk on well lit paths with friends or students.
[50:46.280 --> 50:49.280]  Secure the windows and doors of their dorm room or apartment.
[50:49.280 --> 50:51.280]  Know how to reach campus security.
[50:51.280 --> 50:53.280]  Always tell someone where they're going
[50:53.280 --> 50:55.280]  and when to expect their return.
[50:55.280 --> 50:58.280]  And always carry a self-defense device.

[54:19.280 --> 54:23.280]  Like it's your little toy.
[54:23.280 --> 54:27.280]  You put a gun in my hand,
[54:27.280 --> 54:32.280]  and you hide from my eyes.
[54:32.280 --> 54:34.280]  And you turn and run farther
[54:34.280 --> 54:38.280]  when the fast bullets fly.
[54:38.280 --> 54:43.280]  Like a Judas of old.
[54:43.280 --> 54:47.280]  You lie in DC.
[54:47.280 --> 54:51.280]  A world war can be won.
[54:51.280 --> 54:56.280]  You want me to believe.
[54:56.280 --> 55:00.280]  But I see through your eyes.
[55:00.280 --> 55:05.280]  And I see through your brain.
[55:05.280 --> 55:07.280]  Like I see through the water
[55:07.280 --> 55:15.280]  that runs down my drain.
[55:15.280 --> 55:19.280]  You fasten all the triggers
[55:19.280 --> 55:24.280]  for the others to fire.
[55:24.280 --> 55:28.280]  You set back and watch
[55:28.280 --> 55:32.280]  when death count gets higher.
[55:32.280 --> 55:37.280]  You hide in your mansion
[55:37.280 --> 55:41.280]  when the young people's blood
[55:41.280 --> 55:43.280]  flows out of their bodies
[55:43.280 --> 55:48.280]  and is buried in the mud.
[55:48.280 --> 55:52.280]  He's thrown the worst fear
[55:52.280 --> 55:57.280]  that can ever be hurled.
[55:57.280 --> 56:01.280]  Fear to bring children
[56:01.280 --> 56:05.280]  into the world
[56:05.280 --> 56:10.280]  before threatening my baby.
[56:10.280 --> 56:14.280]  Unborn and unnamed.
[56:14.280 --> 56:16.280]  He made worth the blood
[56:16.280 --> 56:22.280]  that runs in your veins.
[56:22.280 --> 56:27.280]  How much do I know?
[56:27.280 --> 56:31.280]  But to talk at a turn,
[56:31.280 --> 56:35.280]  you must say that I'm young.
[56:35.280 --> 56:40.280]  You must say I'm unlearned.
[56:40.280 --> 56:44.280]  But there's one thing I know.
[56:44.280 --> 56:48.280]  I'm younger than you.
[56:48.280 --> 56:51.280]  Even Jesus would never forgive
[56:51.280 --> 56:55.280]  what you do.
[56:55.280 --> 56:59.280]  Let me ask you one question.
[56:59.280 --> 57:03.280]  Is your money that good?
[57:03.280 --> 57:08.280]  Will it buy you forgiveness?
[57:08.280 --> 57:12.280]  Do you think that it could?
[57:12.280 --> 57:16.280]  I think you will find
[57:16.280 --> 57:20.280]  when your death takes its toll.
[57:20.280 --> 57:22.280]  All the money you made
[57:22.280 --> 57:27.280]  will never buy back your soul.
[57:27.280 --> 57:31.280]  And I'll bet you die.
[57:31.280 --> 57:36.280]  And your death will come soon.
[57:36.280 --> 57:41.280]  I'll follow your casket.
[57:41.280 --> 57:43.280]  Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[57:43.280 --> 57:46.280]  Absolutely couldn't say it better than Bob Dylan.
[57:46.280 --> 57:48.280]  And let me just tell you, Bob Dylan
[57:48.280 --> 57:50.280]  knows all about the New World Order.
[57:50.280 --> 57:54.280]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[57:54.280 --> 57:58.280]  How could you write a song like that and not know?
[57:58.280 --> 58:01.280]  But I do know.
[58:01.280 --> 58:03.280]  And so do you.
[58:03.280 --> 58:05.280]  I'll recap the incredible news.
[58:05.280 --> 58:07.280]  Congress threatened with physical martial law.
[58:07.280 --> 58:11.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, that is martial law.
[58:11.280 --> 58:16.280]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[58:16.280 --> 58:21.280]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:21.280 --> 58:23.280]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[58:23.280 --> 58:26.280]  I've come with a message of information.
[58:26.280 --> 58:28.280]  9-Eleven was an inside job.
[58:28.280 --> 58:30.280]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[58:30.280 --> 58:32.280]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[58:32.280 --> 58:35.280]  I'll do the American people know that 9-Eleven was a stage.
[58:35.280 --> 58:39.280]  David Rockefeller, the collateral commission, the CFR.
[58:39.280 --> 58:42.280]  The day that we stop asking questions
[58:42.280 --> 58:45.280]  is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[58:45.280 --> 58:47.280]  to grow at our own door.
[58:47.280 --> 58:50.280]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[58:50.280 --> 58:53.280]  a global awakening has taken place.
[58:53.280 --> 58:55.280]  An inside job.
[58:55.280 --> 58:57.280]  How dare you?
[58:57.280 --> 59:01.280]  If you know that there's treason going on,
[59:01.280 --> 59:03.280]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[59:03.280 --> 59:06.280]  Paul Allen is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[59:06.280 --> 59:08.280]  And if the government has not told the truth,
[59:08.280 --> 59:12.280]  in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-Eleven.
[59:12.280 --> 59:13.280]  Please rise.

[59:18.280 --> 59:34.280]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[59:48.280 --> 59:53.280]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[59:53.280 --> 59:55.280]  I know many stations have just joined us.
[59:55.280 --> 59:57.280]  I'm going to recap and get into more detail.
[59:57.280 --> 1:00:00.280]  The most important information taking place right now.
[1:00:00.280 --> 1:00:05.280]  It's so big I haven't gotten into all the other huge news.
[1:00:05.280 --> 1:00:07.280]  We're going to cover it all.
[1:00:07.280 --> 1:00:09.280]  Congress from non-Paul is being lined up at the show right now,
[1:00:09.280 --> 1:00:11.280]  sometime in the next three hours.
[1:00:11.280 --> 1:00:14.280]  Congressman Dan Hamburg is going to be on concerning the story
[1:00:14.280 --> 1:00:17.280]  we're about to cover coming up in an hour and a half.
[1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:19.280]  And then while we have Congressman Brad Sherman,
[1:00:19.280 --> 1:00:22.280]  the central of the story we're reporting on,
[1:00:22.280 --> 1:00:27.280]  joining us as well coming up in the middle of the fourth hour today.
[1:00:27.280 --> 1:00:29.280]  One of the most important, if not the most important,
[1:00:29.280 --> 1:00:32.280]  transmission ever, no doubt more important transmissions
[1:00:32.280 --> 1:00:36.280]  will be coming in the near future as the clash between free humanity
[1:00:36.280 --> 1:00:44.280]  and those that are on the side of goodness and the light fight against darkness.
[1:00:44.280 --> 1:00:49.280]  Huge story up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com right now.
[1:00:49.280 --> 1:00:53.280]  Martial law will be declared if banker bailout not passed in-house.
[1:00:53.280 --> 1:00:56.280]  Kurt Nemo, infowars.com.
[1:00:56.280 --> 1:00:58.280]  In-house debate on the banker rescue,
[1:00:58.280 --> 1:01:02.280]  bill representative Brad Sherman, coming up later,
[1:01:02.280 --> 1:01:06.280]  told his fellow Congress members that the government will declare martial law
[1:01:06.280 --> 1:01:10.280]  and the stock market will drop 3,000 points if the bill is not passed.
[1:01:10.280 --> 1:01:13.280]  The panic mongers were to the point of telling people
[1:01:13.280 --> 1:01:18.280]  the market would drop 3,000 points and there would be martial law said
[1:01:18.280 --> 1:01:26.280]  the congressman, physical martial law, not just in Congress with the rules.
[1:01:26.280 --> 1:01:29.280]  Sherman's comment was not the same context as the comment issue
[1:01:29.280 --> 1:01:33.280]  of representative Michael Burgess earlier in the week on this radio show.
[1:01:33.280 --> 1:01:35.280]  Burgess, who appeared on the only shown shows
[1:01:35.280 --> 1:01:40.280]  had Pelosi threatened to invoke House Rule 1360, described as martial law,
[1:01:40.280 --> 1:01:45.280]  intended to subpoena normal procedures, suspend normal procedures and safeguards,
[1:01:45.280 --> 1:01:49.280]  and thus allow the House leadership to operate in a more authoritarian fashion.
[1:01:49.280 --> 1:01:52.280]  Sherman, however, said martial law would be declared on Wall Street,
[1:01:52.280 --> 1:01:55.280]  not in the House of Representatives.
[1:01:55.280 --> 1:01:58.280]  Others are being told this as well, we have confirmed.
[1:01:58.280 --> 1:02:03.280]  Representative Sherman said the exaggerated fear mongering turned out not to be true
[1:02:03.280 --> 1:02:05.280]  and the House can draft a good bill.
[1:02:05.280 --> 1:02:09.280]  Regardless of the pressure put on representatives to pass the banker bailout bill,
[1:02:09.280 --> 1:02:14.280]  the bailout plan is not only economic fascism, as Richard Vigory has correctly noted,
[1:02:14.280 --> 1:02:19.280]  designed to loot the US Treasury and reorganize and further consolidate
[1:02:19.280 --> 1:02:23.280]  the control of the economy, but it's also a brazen effort to impose a martial law
[1:02:23.280 --> 1:02:28.280]  and dictatorship, Paulson's role as financial dictator, not answerable to Congress
[1:02:28.280 --> 1:02:33.280]  or the American people, fully complements additional steps taken over the last few years.
[1:02:33.280 --> 1:02:38.280]  I would add that they've made the plan worse than it was last week and earlier this week,
[1:02:38.280 --> 1:02:43.280]  even more criminal power.
[1:02:43.280 --> 1:02:48.280]  As former California congressman joining us later in the show, Dan Hamburg said earlier this year
[1:02:48.280 --> 1:02:52.280]  in 2007 in a detailed report in the San Francisco Chronicle,
[1:02:52.280 --> 1:02:57.280]  National Defense Authorization Act gives the executive the power to invoke martial law
[1:02:57.280 --> 1:03:01.280]  in case of major public emergency is not limited to a natural disaster,
[1:03:01.280 --> 1:03:05.280]  a disease outbreak or terrorist attack, but also any other condition in which the president determines
[1:03:05.280 --> 1:03:11.280]  the domestic violence has occurred to the extent that state officials cannot maintain public order.
[1:03:11.280 --> 1:03:16.280]  Obviously, a financial crash and insured social chaos of the sort now being implemented
[1:03:16.280 --> 1:03:19.280]  by the ruling elite would be characterized as a dire emergency
[1:03:19.280 --> 1:03:24.280]  and a near perfect excuse to impose martial law, a longstanding goal of the elite.
[1:03:24.280 --> 1:03:28.280]  We need to add all the IMF and World Bank document articles we did.
[1:03:28.280 --> 1:03:32.280]  We need to add the reports where we talk about how they detailed this and planned this
[1:03:32.280 --> 1:03:36.280]  and how we told people years before it happened what they were planning to do.
[1:03:36.280 --> 1:03:40.280]  We need to add the documents that this is a contrived operation
[1:03:40.280 --> 1:03:43.280]  and that they've been gearing up for martial law quietly,
[1:03:43.280 --> 1:03:50.280]  so what you're going to see probably happen very soon, again, didn't just pop up overnight.
[1:03:50.280 --> 1:03:56.280]  As well, the Military Commissions Act 2006 codifying indefinite imprisonment of disdistance
[1:03:56.280 --> 1:04:00.280]  and the National Security Presidential Direct of 51 ensuring the continuity of government
[1:04:00.280 --> 1:04:04.280]  and separating Congress from that in the event of a catastrophic emergency or tools
[1:04:04.280 --> 1:04:08.280]  the government will most assuredly use after the economy implodes
[1:04:08.280 --> 1:04:12.280]  and now a far gone conclusion according to many economists.
[1:04:12.280 --> 1:04:17.280]  And remember, they are engineering all of this.
[1:04:17.280 --> 1:04:20.280]  We'll come back, finish up with the article, play some of the more key audio clips
[1:04:20.280 --> 1:04:24.280]  and get to some of the incredible guests we have as we document all of this.
[1:04:24.280 --> 1:04:26.280]  This is so massive.
[1:04:26.280 --> 1:04:31.280]  And these stories are going mega viral, we've got to beef them up.
[1:04:31.280 --> 1:04:34.280]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[1:04:34.280 --> 1:04:38.280]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:04:38.280 --> 1:04:40.280]  The enemies struck America on September 11th.
[1:04:40.280 --> 1:04:42.280]  But who is the enemy?
[1:04:42.280 --> 1:04:43.280]  Bin Laden.
[1:04:43.280 --> 1:04:44.280]  This is his MO.
[1:04:44.280 --> 1:04:47.280]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:04:47.280 --> 1:04:50.280]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look
[1:04:50.280 --> 1:04:54.280]  at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:04:54.280 --> 1:04:57.280]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again
[1:04:57.280 --> 1:05:01.280]  very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:05:01.280 --> 1:05:05.280]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:05:05.280 --> 1:05:09.280]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI,
[1:05:09.280 --> 1:05:12.280]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:05:12.280 --> 1:05:15.280]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[1:05:15.280 --> 1:05:16.280]  Fabled Enemies.

[1:06:34.280 --> 1:06:37.280]  When it comes to this economy, the banks are crashing,
[1:06:37.280 --> 1:06:40.280]  the stock market's a mess, there's the mortgage crisis,
[1:06:40.280 --> 1:06:42.280]  there's the lending crisis,
[1:06:42.280 --> 1:06:46.280]  there's the food and gasoline prices through the ceiling crisis,
[1:06:46.280 --> 1:06:48.280]  and we're paralyzed a little bit.
[1:06:48.280 --> 1:06:50.280]  We don't know exactly how to respond to it.
[1:06:50.280 --> 1:06:52.280]  I don't know what to say. What can you do?
[1:06:52.280 --> 1:06:54.280]  Do what you can do. That's what you do. You do what you can do.
[1:06:54.280 --> 1:06:56.280]  What I can do is I can put some food away.
[1:06:56.280 --> 1:06:58.280]  I know there's a global food shortage.
[1:06:58.280 --> 1:07:00.280]  I can read it. I can go to eFoodsDirect.com,
[1:07:00.280 --> 1:07:02.280]  read hundreds of articles about this.
[1:07:02.280 --> 1:07:06.280]  I can go up on the Google website and Google food shortage and see the world's a mess.
[1:07:06.280 --> 1:07:08.280]  I know it. You know it. Look at the prices. Look where they're headed.
[1:07:08.280 --> 1:07:10.280]  Be prepared. Take care of yourself.
[1:07:10.280 --> 1:07:13.280]  Do owe your family some security, some sense of self-being.
[1:07:13.280 --> 1:07:16.280]  A little bit of self-reliance is a good idea right now.

[1:08:00.280 --> 1:08:03.280]  I want to be clear to everyone tuning in.
[1:08:05.280 --> 1:08:09.280]  Congressman Burgess on Monday was told
[1:08:09.280 --> 1:08:13.280]  House rules will be suspended, and that's unconstitutional,
[1:08:13.280 --> 1:08:16.280]  and that basically the committee chairman would basically run everything.
[1:08:16.280 --> 1:08:18.280]  They didn't pass it.
[1:08:18.280 --> 1:08:21.280]  Others, congressmen on the record, have said that they've been threatened,
[1:08:21.280 --> 1:08:24.280]  that martial law would be declared if anybody tries to impeach Bush.
[1:08:24.280 --> 1:08:27.280]  When North com has been deployed to the United States,
[1:08:27.280 --> 1:08:30.280]  it's set up as a theater of operations over the U.S.
[1:08:30.280 --> 1:08:34.280]  PDD-51 was signed last year saying that President Bush
[1:08:34.280 --> 1:08:37.280]  or any other president to come as a dictator.
[1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:41.280]  Congress is not co-equal and is now defunct,
[1:08:41.280 --> 1:08:46.280]  just like the emperor declared in episode 3 of Star Wars.
[1:08:46.280 --> 1:08:49.280]  Again, but this isn't a children's movie.
[1:08:49.280 --> 1:08:51.280]  This is the real world.
[1:08:51.280 --> 1:08:55.280]  Of course, on record, George Lucas said that he made that film
[1:08:55.280 --> 1:08:58.280]  and kind of changed the script to have it mirror what's happening today.
[1:08:58.280 --> 1:09:00.280]  He said that three years ago.
[1:09:00.280 --> 1:09:04.280]  I'm only pointing out in pop culture that seems to be a good analogy for people.
[1:09:04.280 --> 1:09:08.280]  This is very serious.
[1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:14.280]  Okay, folks, so we are here at the crossroads.
[1:09:14.280 --> 1:09:18.280]  We are here at a major crossroads.
[1:09:18.280 --> 1:09:25.280]  And Burgess on Monday, who we had on,
[1:09:25.280 --> 1:09:28.280]  was talking about martial law just in the house.
[1:09:28.280 --> 1:09:31.280]  This is martial law in the country.
[1:09:31.280 --> 1:09:33.280]  And they've geared up for it.
[1:09:33.280 --> 1:09:34.280]  They've announced it.
[1:09:34.280 --> 1:09:37.280]  And the Congress has been told and the chairman of the committee
[1:09:37.280 --> 1:09:39.280]  and others have been told of Homeland Security
[1:09:39.280 --> 1:09:42.280]  that are supposedly co-equal with the president in national security
[1:09:42.280 --> 1:09:46.280]  that they can't see the details of PDD-51.
[1:09:46.280 --> 1:09:49.280]  But the cover sheet says,
[1:09:49.280 --> 1:09:52.280]  Congress has no authority and runs nothing during any emergency.
[1:09:52.280 --> 1:09:55.280]  Neither the governors.
[1:09:55.280 --> 1:09:58.280]  This hasn't been declared since Lincoln.
[1:09:58.280 --> 1:10:02.280]  And even then, Lincoln, you know, claimed that Congress had power
[1:10:02.280 --> 1:10:04.280]  and was co-equal.
[1:10:04.280 --> 1:10:07.280]  Though he had several congressmen arrested in newspaper,
[1:10:07.280 --> 1:10:10.280]  owners and editors, actually hundreds of those,
[1:10:10.280 --> 1:10:13.280]  but two members of Congress were arrested
[1:10:13.280 --> 1:10:16.280]  and basically put on house arrest for months.
[1:10:16.280 --> 1:10:20.280]  This isn't a game, okay?
[1:10:20.280 --> 1:10:25.280]  And only the public being aware of this police state
[1:10:25.280 --> 1:10:27.280]  and saying no.
[1:10:27.280 --> 1:10:30.280]  And politically, police chiefs, mayors, governors,
[1:10:30.280 --> 1:10:32.280]  800-plus towns and cities,
[1:10:32.280 --> 1:10:34.280]  what five states passed law saying,
[1:10:34.280 --> 1:10:36.280]  no to the Patriot Act, no to martial law.
[1:10:36.280 --> 1:10:38.280]  Remember all that in the last four years?
[1:10:38.280 --> 1:10:40.280]  We went down to Austin.
[1:10:40.280 --> 1:10:44.280]  We got the fellow Austinites got it thrown out here
[1:10:44.280 --> 1:10:48.280]  that footage is in Matrix of Evil.
[1:10:48.280 --> 1:10:50.280]  By the way, I'm going to find that clip for Matrix of Evil.
[1:10:50.280 --> 1:10:53.280]  I'm going to play that when we have time today.
[1:10:53.280 --> 1:10:58.280]  Where you can hear me talking about how they were preparing then.
[1:10:58.280 --> 1:11:02.280]  This is the reality.
[1:11:02.280 --> 1:11:06.280]  It's saying no, it's not going along with it.
[1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:08.280]  It's having grand jurors, grand juries,
[1:11:08.280 --> 1:11:10.280]  and died some of these banker people for their crimes,
[1:11:10.280 --> 1:11:13.280]  as Ron Paul said last week.
[1:11:13.280 --> 1:11:16.280]  And it's death the neural water by a thousand cuts.
[1:11:16.280 --> 1:11:18.280]  It's hitting them at all different angles at all different levels.
[1:11:18.280 --> 1:11:20.280]  There's no magic silver bullet.
[1:11:20.280 --> 1:11:22.280]  It's awareness, it's awakening,
[1:11:22.280 --> 1:11:23.280]  and the people are starting to awaken,
[1:11:23.280 --> 1:11:25.280]  but they have no idea just how deep the rabbit hole goes.
[1:11:25.280 --> 1:11:29.280]  So let's play Congressman Burgess Monday
[1:11:29.280 --> 1:11:31.280]  talking about martial law in the house
[1:11:31.280 --> 1:11:34.280]  versus Congressman Brad Sherman
[1:11:34.280 --> 1:11:37.280]  talking about nationwide martial law.
[1:11:37.280 --> 1:11:39.280]  Gentlemen, the time has expired.
[1:11:39.280 --> 1:11:41.280]  The gentleman from Texas.
[1:11:41.280 --> 1:11:43.280]  The speaker asked me to address the house for one minute,
[1:11:43.280 --> 1:11:44.280]  revise and extend my remarks.
[1:11:44.280 --> 1:11:45.280]  Without objection.
[1:11:45.280 --> 1:11:47.280]  The speaker, I also come to the floor today
[1:11:47.280 --> 1:11:50.280]  to talk about this $700 billion bill that's in front of us.
[1:11:50.280 --> 1:11:52.280]  I use the term bill advisedly,
[1:11:52.280 --> 1:11:54.280]  because we have seen no bill.
[1:11:54.280 --> 1:11:56.280]  We are here debating talking points
[1:11:56.280 --> 1:11:58.280]  on perhaps what is one of the most largest,
[1:11:58.280 --> 1:12:00.280]  the largest fundamental change
[1:12:00.280 --> 1:12:03.280]  in our nation's financial system in its history.
[1:12:03.280 --> 1:12:06.280]  And House Republicans have been cut out of the process.
[1:12:06.280 --> 1:12:08.280]  Not only have we been cut out of the process,
[1:12:08.280 --> 1:12:11.280]  we've also been derided by the leadership of the Democratic Party
[1:12:11.280 --> 1:12:13.280]  and called unpatriotic for not participating.
[1:12:13.280 --> 1:12:16.280]  Mr. Speaker, I have been thrown out of more meetings
[1:12:16.280 --> 1:12:18.280]  in this capital in the last 24 hours
[1:12:18.280 --> 1:12:20.280]  than I ever thought possible
[1:12:20.280 --> 1:12:22.280]  as a duly elected representative
[1:12:22.280 --> 1:12:25.280]  of 820,000 citizens of North Texas.
[1:12:25.280 --> 1:12:28.280]  Mr. Speaker, politics is a full contact sport
[1:12:28.280 --> 1:12:30.280]  and I understand that,
[1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:32.280]  but it is a full contact sport in the light of day,
[1:12:32.280 --> 1:12:34.280]  in the public arena.
[1:12:34.280 --> 1:12:37.280]  Since we didn't have hearings, since we didn't have markups,
[1:12:37.280 --> 1:12:40.280]  let's at least put this legislation up on the internet
[1:12:40.280 --> 1:12:42.280]  for 24 hours.
[1:12:42.280 --> 1:12:44.280]  That's what Thomas was made for.
[1:12:44.280 --> 1:12:46.280]  Let's do that and let the American people
[1:12:46.280 --> 1:12:48.280]  see what we have done in the dark of night.
[1:12:48.280 --> 1:12:50.280]  After all, I have not gotten any more mail,
[1:12:50.280 --> 1:12:52.280]  any more emails on any other subject
[1:12:52.280 --> 1:12:54.280]  than this one that is before us today.
[1:12:54.280 --> 1:12:57.280]  Mr. Speaker, I understand we're under martial laws
[1:12:57.280 --> 1:12:59.280]  declared by the Speaker last night.
[1:12:59.280 --> 1:13:01.280]  I think it's ironic.
[1:13:01.280 --> 1:13:03.280]  House Republicans have not been needed
[1:13:03.280 --> 1:13:05.280]  in this house to assure passage
[1:13:05.280 --> 1:13:07.280]  for the last 22 months.
[1:13:07.280 --> 1:13:09.280]  And today, we're going to be asked
[1:13:09.280 --> 1:13:11.280]  to vote for a bill for political cover
[1:13:11.280 --> 1:13:13.280]  because Democrats are too weak
[1:13:13.280 --> 1:13:15.280]  to stand up to their speaker.
[1:13:15.280 --> 1:13:17.280]  I yield back.
[1:13:17.280 --> 1:13:19.280]  Gentlemen's time has expired.
[1:13:19.280 --> 1:13:21.280]  The gentleman from New Jersey.
[1:13:21.280 --> 1:13:23.280]  Now, that's Monday.
[1:13:23.280 --> 1:13:25.280]  This is last night
[1:13:25.280 --> 1:13:27.280]  when the congressman is coming up later.
[1:13:27.280 --> 1:13:29.280]  They were threatened with martial law
[1:13:29.280 --> 1:13:31.280]  nationwide. Listen carefully.
[1:13:31.280 --> 1:13:33.280]  City from Ohio.
[1:13:33.280 --> 1:13:35.280]  The only way they can pass this bill
[1:13:35.280 --> 1:13:37.280]  is by creating and sustaining
[1:13:37.280 --> 1:13:39.280]  a panic atmosphere.
[1:13:39.280 --> 1:13:41.280]  That atmosphere is not justified.
[1:13:41.280 --> 1:13:43.280]  Many of us were told
[1:13:43.280 --> 1:13:45.280]  in private conversations
[1:13:45.280 --> 1:13:47.280]  that if we voted against this bill
[1:13:47.280 --> 1:13:49.280]  on Monday
[1:13:49.280 --> 1:13:51.280]  that the sky would fall,
[1:13:51.280 --> 1:13:53.280]  the market would drop
[1:13:53.280 --> 1:13:55.280]  2,000 or 3,000 points the first day,
[1:13:55.280 --> 1:13:57.280]  another couple of thousand the second day,
[1:13:57.280 --> 1:13:59.280]  and a few members were even told
[1:13:59.280 --> 1:14:01.280]  that there would be martial law
[1:14:01.280 --> 1:14:03.280]  in America if we voted no.
[1:14:03.280 --> 1:14:05.280]  That's what I call
[1:14:05.280 --> 1:14:07.280]  fear-mongering, unjustified,
[1:14:07.280 --> 1:14:09.280]  proven wrong.
[1:14:09.280 --> 1:14:11.280]  We've got a week. We've got two weeks
[1:14:11.280 --> 1:14:13.280]  to write a good bill.
[1:14:13.280 --> 1:14:15.280]  The only way to write to pass a bad bill
[1:14:15.280 --> 1:14:17.280]  keep the panic pressure on.
[1:14:17.280 --> 1:14:19.280]  Now, what has the Senate done
[1:14:19.280 --> 1:14:21.280]  to this bill?
[1:14:21.280 --> 1:14:23.280]  And
[1:14:23.280 --> 1:14:25.280]  how we burned in the camps
[1:14:25.280 --> 1:14:27.280]  later thinking, what would things
[1:14:27.280 --> 1:14:29.280]  have been like if every security operative
[1:14:29.280 --> 1:14:31.280]  when he went out at night to make an arrest
[1:14:31.280 --> 1:14:33.280]  had been uncertain whether he would return alive
[1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:35.280]  and have to say goodbye to his family
[1:14:35.280 --> 1:14:37.280]  or if during periods of mass arrest,
[1:14:37.280 --> 1:14:39.280]  as for example
[1:14:39.280 --> 1:14:41.280]  in Leningrad,
[1:14:41.280 --> 1:14:43.280]  when they arrested a quarter of the entire city,
[1:14:43.280 --> 1:14:45.280]  people had not simply sat there
[1:14:45.280 --> 1:14:47.280]  in their
[1:14:47.280 --> 1:14:49.280]  layers, pailing in terror
[1:14:49.280 --> 1:14:51.280]  at every bang on the downstairs door
[1:14:51.280 --> 1:14:53.280]  and at every step on the staircase,
[1:14:53.280 --> 1:14:55.280]  but it understood that they had nothing left
[1:14:55.280 --> 1:14:57.280]  to lose and had boldly set up
[1:14:57.280 --> 1:14:59.280]  in the downstairs hall an ambush
[1:14:59.280 --> 1:15:01.280]  of half a dozen people with axes,
[1:15:01.280 --> 1:15:03.280]  hammers, pokers, or whatever else
[1:15:03.280 --> 1:15:05.280]  was at hand.
[1:15:05.280 --> 1:15:07.280]  The organs
[1:15:07.280 --> 1:15:09.280]  of the police state would have very quickly
[1:15:09.280 --> 1:15:11.280]  suffered a shortage of officers
[1:15:11.280 --> 1:15:13.280]  and transport and notwithstanding all of Stalin's
[1:15:13.280 --> 1:15:15.280]  thirst, the cursed machine
[1:15:15.280 --> 1:15:17.280]  would have ground to a halt. Alexander
[1:15:17.280 --> 1:15:19.280]  Schultz and Eatson, Gulag Archipelago.
[1:15:19.280 --> 1:15:21.280]  We don't want
[1:15:21.280 --> 1:15:25.280]  it to come to that, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:15:25.280 --> 1:15:27.280]  We don't
[1:15:27.280 --> 1:15:29.280]  want
[1:15:29.280 --> 1:15:31.280]  it to come to that.
[1:15:31.280 --> 1:15:33.280]  But I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:15:33.280 --> 1:15:35.280]  the very people that ran
[1:15:35.280 --> 1:15:37.280]  the communist operations, the Nazi operations,
[1:15:37.280 --> 1:15:39.280]  the same central banks based in London,
[1:15:39.280 --> 1:15:41.280]  it is historical fact
[1:15:41.280 --> 1:15:43.280]  there are mainline award-winning history books
[1:15:43.280 --> 1:15:45.280]  over 900 pages like Carol Quigley's
[1:15:45.280 --> 1:15:47.280]  and others where the elite itself
[1:15:47.280 --> 1:15:49.280]  admits this.
[1:15:49.280 --> 1:15:51.280]  A recently published book by Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[1:15:51.280 --> 1:15:53.280]  He brags about the U.S. funding
[1:15:53.280 --> 1:15:55.280]  Pol Pot to kill 2 million.
[1:15:57.280 --> 1:15:59.280]  Our own criminal government, which isn't our
[1:15:59.280 --> 1:16:01.280]  government, put Mao Zedong into power.
[1:16:01.280 --> 1:16:03.280]  That's now declassified.
[1:16:03.280 --> 1:16:05.280]  This doesn't have to
[1:16:05.280 --> 1:16:07.280]  happen. I mean, it wasn't enough to ship in heroin and cocaine
[1:16:07.280 --> 1:16:09.280]  into the country. It wasn't enough to put everybody in prison.
[1:16:09.280 --> 1:16:11.280]  It wasn't enough to set up a police state. It wasn't
[1:16:11.280 --> 1:16:13.280]  enough to squeeze and squeeze. They wanted all.
[1:16:13.280 --> 1:16:15.280]  They wanted to destroy America.
[1:16:15.280 --> 1:16:17.280]  And they've got us into debt.
[1:16:17.280 --> 1:16:19.280]  They got us to buy into the baloney of Wall
[1:16:19.280 --> 1:16:21.280]  Street and the media. And now they've got us
[1:16:21.280 --> 1:16:23.280]  where they think they want us. But the good news is
[1:16:23.280 --> 1:16:25.280]  the people are finally awakening.
[1:16:25.280 --> 1:16:27.280]  The sleeping giant is finally awakening to what's
[1:16:27.280 --> 1:16:29.280]  happening.
[1:16:33.280 --> 1:16:35.280]  And Kurt
[1:16:35.280 --> 1:16:37.280]  sent me earlier
[1:16:37.280 --> 1:16:39.280]  it's Congressman
[1:16:39.280 --> 1:16:41.280]  John Oliver.
[1:16:41.280 --> 1:16:43.280]  It was John Oliver reporting on it
[1:16:43.280 --> 1:16:45.280]  months ago, and there's another congressman
[1:16:45.280 --> 1:16:47.280]  who was told,
[1:16:47.280 --> 1:16:49.280]  if you
[1:16:49.280 --> 1:16:51.280]  try to impeach George Bush, we will
[1:16:51.280 --> 1:16:53.280]  stage martial law
[1:16:53.280 --> 1:16:55.280]  on the United States headline.
[1:16:55.280 --> 1:16:57.280]  Iran attack election suspension,
[1:16:57.280 --> 1:16:59.280]  martial law on the cards.
[1:16:59.280 --> 1:17:01.280]  This is from July 26, 2008,
[1:17:01.280 --> 1:17:03.280]  a few months ago.
[1:17:03.280 --> 1:17:05.280]  It didn't make the news, at least not
[1:17:05.280 --> 1:17:07.280]  the corporate news, according to Bob Führer. Bush
[1:17:07.280 --> 1:17:09.280]  will attack Iran declare martial law
[1:17:09.280 --> 1:17:11.280]  and suspend the election. Congress
[1:17:11.280 --> 1:17:13.280]  critter John Oliver apparently made
[1:17:13.280 --> 1:17:15.280]  a claim at a town hall meeting
[1:17:15.280 --> 1:17:17.280]  at the Jones Library in Amherst, Massachusetts,
[1:17:17.280 --> 1:17:19.280]  and it made it into a bunch of newspapers.
[1:17:19.280 --> 1:17:21.280]  And the reporters are on record. Last July
[1:17:21.280 --> 1:17:23.280]  Führer, a lawyer,
[1:17:23.280 --> 1:17:25.280]  political activist challenged Oliver
[1:17:25.280 --> 1:17:27.280]  in the first congressional district of Massachusetts
[1:17:27.280 --> 1:17:29.280]  was at the town hall meeting with others
[1:17:29.280 --> 1:17:31.280]  to present Oliver with
[1:17:31.280 --> 1:17:33.280]  resolutions impeached Bush for war crimes.
[1:17:33.280 --> 1:17:35.280]  When Oliver made these comments on July
[1:17:35.280 --> 1:17:37.280]  5, 2007,
[1:17:37.280 --> 1:17:39.280]  the Atford Downing Street website posted
[1:17:39.280 --> 1:17:41.280]  Führer's retelling of the incident.
[1:17:41.280 --> 1:17:43.280]  And it goes into that, and that was confirmed later.
[1:17:43.280 --> 1:17:45.280]  It was in major newspapers.
[1:17:45.280 --> 1:17:47.280]  So, there's another congressman on record
[1:17:47.280 --> 1:17:49.280]  saying they've been told this. I mean,
[1:17:49.280 --> 1:17:51.280]  Northcom, they come into the Army Times and announce
[1:17:51.280 --> 1:17:53.280]  yeah, the Army is going to be here for riot control,
[1:17:53.280 --> 1:17:55.280]  civil unrest, non-lethal weapons.
[1:17:55.280 --> 1:17:57.280]  We hope it up to shoot you with regular bullets.
[1:17:57.280 --> 1:17:59.280]  Regular brigades. They're going to rotate
[1:17:59.280 --> 1:18:01.280]  more brigades in for this.
[1:18:05.280 --> 1:18:07.280]  And you know, if we back this off, if we stop
[1:18:07.280 --> 1:18:09.280]  this, our attractors will say, oh, see,
[1:18:09.280 --> 1:18:11.280]  you said martial law, it doesn't exist.
[1:18:11.280 --> 1:18:13.280]  North American Union doesn't exist.
[1:18:13.280 --> 1:18:15.280]  The WMDs were in Iraq. Ha, ha, ha.
[1:18:15.280 --> 1:18:17.280]  It doesn't matter.
[1:18:17.280 --> 1:18:19.280]  That will be our victory.
[1:18:19.280 --> 1:18:21.280]  And stop
[1:18:27.280 --> 1:18:29.280]  stopping it. I don't know if it can be done,
[1:18:29.280 --> 1:18:31.280]  but we should stop it if we can.
[1:18:31.280 --> 1:18:33.280]  And so, we have the facts.
[1:18:33.280 --> 1:18:35.280]  We have the Army Times. We have all the mainstream news.
[1:18:35.280 --> 1:18:37.280]  We have the congressman on record.
[1:18:37.280 --> 1:18:39.280]  They're saying this. They're doing this.
[1:18:39.280 --> 1:18:41.280]  They're pushing this.
[1:18:43.280 --> 1:18:45.280]  We've got to stand firm against this, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:18:45.280 --> 1:18:47.280]  We've got to get the word out.
[1:18:47.280 --> 1:18:49.280]  And I need everybody
[1:18:49.280 --> 1:18:51.280]  to go to prisonplanet.com and infowars.com
[1:18:51.280 --> 1:18:53.280]  and get these stories we've written
[1:18:53.280 --> 1:18:55.280]  on this subject and get it out to everybody.
[1:18:55.280 --> 1:18:57.280]  I'm not playing
[1:18:57.280 --> 1:18:59.280]  at this. We're not doing this
[1:18:59.280 --> 1:19:01.280]  to play patty kick.
[1:19:01.280 --> 1:19:03.280]  We are fighting a new world order as hard
[1:19:03.280 --> 1:19:05.280]  as we can, risking our lives. Do you imagine
[1:19:05.280 --> 1:19:07.280]  being on the front line of this?
[1:19:07.280 --> 1:19:09.280]  I mean, not just the government,
[1:19:09.280 --> 1:19:11.280]  but all the crazies and the rest of it
[1:19:11.280 --> 1:19:13.280]  that come out of the woodwork. It is
[1:19:13.280 --> 1:19:15.280]  so essential.
[1:19:19.280 --> 1:19:21.280]  It is so essential
[1:19:23.280 --> 1:19:25.280]  to stand up against this system now,
[1:19:25.280 --> 1:19:27.280]  to speak out
[1:19:29.280 --> 1:19:31.280]  and to stand up against this new world order.

[1:23:44.280 --> 1:23:46.280]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins us to talk about
[1:23:46.280 --> 1:23:48.280]  the martial law gear up we're seeing
[1:23:48.280 --> 1:23:50.280]  and a little bit about the bailout.
[1:23:50.280 --> 1:23:52.280]  Then Congressman Dan Hamburg
[1:23:52.280 --> 1:23:54.280]  will be popping in.
[1:23:54.280 --> 1:23:56.280]  Congressman Brad Sherman
[1:23:56.280 --> 1:23:58.280]  who was told martial law
[1:23:58.280 --> 1:24:00.280]  would be declared
[1:24:00.280 --> 1:24:02.280]  nationwide
[1:24:02.280 --> 1:24:04.280]  if
[1:24:04.280 --> 1:24:06.280]  Congress didn't pass it.
[1:24:06.280 --> 1:24:08.280]  The executive saying do this
[1:24:08.280 --> 1:24:10.280]  or we'll take your power. You can't do that executive.
[1:24:10.280 --> 1:24:12.280]  You're not above the Congress
[1:24:12.280 --> 1:24:14.280]  even if you claim you are. Even if you got a bunch
[1:24:14.280 --> 1:24:16.280]  of brainwashed, Northcom drug dealers
[1:24:16.280 --> 1:24:18.280]  at the top, that's what they are.
[1:24:18.280 --> 1:24:20.280]  That's how they first corrupted them decades ago
[1:24:20.280 --> 1:24:22.280]  who helped carry out your 9-11 attack.
[1:24:22.280 --> 1:24:24.280]  Your dictatorship
[1:24:24.280 --> 1:24:26.280]  is going to be exposed.
[1:24:26.280 --> 1:24:28.280]  It's a dictatorship of the corporate leptocracy.
[1:24:28.280 --> 1:24:30.280]  The international bankers. Bush is just their figurehead.
[1:24:34.280 --> 1:24:36.280]  Oh man, so much is happening.
[1:24:36.280 --> 1:24:38.280]  I'm also going to be playing part of Matrix of Evil
[1:24:38.280 --> 1:24:40.280]  where I warned about this in
[1:24:40.280 --> 1:24:42.280]  2003.
[1:24:44.280 --> 1:24:46.280]  It's when Austin threw out the
[1:24:46.280 --> 1:24:48.280]  Patriot Act and hundreds of other cities in multiple states.
[1:24:48.280 --> 1:24:50.280]  You know, in listeners you took action then.
[1:24:50.280 --> 1:24:52.280]  I put out the idea.
[1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:54.280]  When I wrote the first
[1:24:54.280 --> 1:24:56.280]  detailed analysis that won
[1:24:56.280 --> 1:24:58.280]  the Project Sensory Award, I'm just giving you that
[1:24:58.280 --> 1:25:00.280]  as a footnote to find it.
[1:25:00.280 --> 1:25:02.280]  On Patriot Act
[1:25:02.280 --> 1:25:04.280]  1 and 2
[1:25:06.280 --> 1:25:08.280]  a detailed analysis
[1:25:08.280 --> 1:25:10.280]  took me days to write it. It's like
[1:25:10.280 --> 1:25:12.280]  12 pages long. I went through section by
[1:25:12.280 --> 1:25:14.280]  section and interviewed
[1:25:14.280 --> 1:25:16.280]  constitutional scholars to make sure I was writing. Of course it turned out I was.
[1:25:16.280 --> 1:25:20.280]  Just about how hardcore it really was.
[1:25:22.280 --> 1:25:24.280]  And then I put out the idea
[1:25:24.280 --> 1:25:26.280]  because I can't do it all
[1:25:26.280 --> 1:25:28.280]  for listeners all over the country
[1:25:28.280 --> 1:25:30.280]  to have the idea
[1:25:32.280 --> 1:25:34.280]  to start a, I forget the name of it
[1:25:34.280 --> 1:25:36.280]  the Committee on Liberty
[1:25:36.280 --> 1:25:38.280]  to go out and start movements everywhere to throw it out
[1:25:38.280 --> 1:25:40.280]  and it happened everywhere and happened.
[1:25:40.280 --> 1:25:42.280]  We can do the same thing here.
[1:25:42.280 --> 1:25:44.280]  Now city councils have heard us come and warn them about this
[1:25:44.280 --> 1:25:46.280]  and now we don't sound like coups because it's coming true.
[1:25:48.280 --> 1:25:50.280]  States agreed.
[1:25:50.280 --> 1:25:52.280]  What is it? Four or five states last time I checked.
[1:25:52.280 --> 1:25:54.280]  Last time I saw it was like eight considering it
[1:25:54.280 --> 1:25:56.280]  four or five and passed it.
[1:25:56.280 --> 1:25:58.280]  I think it's five now.
[1:25:58.280 --> 1:26:00.280]  Then it kind of fizzled out
[1:26:00.280 --> 1:26:02.280]  because the martial law again wasn't brought in then.
[1:26:02.280 --> 1:26:04.280]  So we have been warning the public
[1:26:04.280 --> 1:26:06.280]  getting the information out.
[1:26:06.280 --> 1:26:08.280]  I'm going to play the intro
[1:26:08.280 --> 1:26:10.280]  off my own cruddy laptop here but later we're going to play it in good audio.
[1:26:10.280 --> 1:26:12.280]  Like 15 minutes of Matrix of Evil after
[1:26:12.280 --> 1:26:14.280]  Dr. Roberts leaves us
[1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:16.280]  and all these congressmen are lined up to join us.
[1:26:16.280 --> 1:26:18.280]  But
[1:26:18.280 --> 1:26:20.280]  I'm going to go ahead and take this back to the start
[1:26:22.280 --> 1:26:24.280]  here.
[1:26:24.280 --> 1:26:26.280]  By the way, you can now get this film on DVD.
[1:26:26.280 --> 1:26:28.280]  We finally took it off that and put it on
[1:26:28.280 --> 1:26:30.280]  from VHS from the original digital tapes
[1:26:30.280 --> 1:26:32.280]  and
[1:26:32.280 --> 1:26:34.280]  DVD is available
[1:26:34.280 --> 1:26:36.280]  Matrix of Evil.
[1:26:36.280 --> 1:26:42.280]  But I'm going to go ahead and start this now.
[1:26:44.280 --> 1:26:46.280]  Good old YouTube is not playing it.
[1:26:52.280 --> 1:26:54.280]  I just wanted people to hear the intro
[1:26:54.280 --> 1:26:56.280]  so that they would
[1:26:56.280 --> 1:26:58.280]  be able to get an idea of what's coming up.
[1:26:58.280 --> 1:27:00.280]  Again, if you didn't just join us
[1:27:00.280 --> 1:27:02.280]  or if you just did join us, I'm going to recap
[1:27:02.280 --> 1:27:04.280]  everything that's going on for everybody.
[1:27:04.280 --> 1:27:06.280]  Coming up with
[1:27:06.280 --> 1:27:08.280]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[1:27:16.280 --> 1:27:18.280]  We're looking at the
[1:27:18.280 --> 1:27:20.280]  literal realization of the military
[1:27:20.280 --> 1:27:22.280]  police state in America.
[1:27:22.280 --> 1:27:24.280]  The American people have failed
[1:27:24.280 --> 1:27:26.280]  in their oversight of the integrity
[1:27:26.280 --> 1:27:28.280]  of our political system.
[1:27:28.280 --> 1:27:30.280]  The entire economy will be prisons,
[1:27:30.280 --> 1:27:32.280]  police and black ski masks,
[1:27:32.280 --> 1:27:34.280]  a Nazi Germany like nightmare.
[1:27:34.280 --> 1:27:36.280]  Final part is the American people.
[1:27:36.280 --> 1:27:38.280]  We need to break that connection
[1:27:38.280 --> 1:27:40.280]  between the police and the military.
[1:27:40.280 --> 1:27:42.280]  We're charging with weapons of mass destruction
[1:27:42.280 --> 1:27:44.280]  because they have marijuana.
[1:27:44.280 --> 1:27:46.280]  We support the Constitution.
[1:27:46.280 --> 1:27:48.280]  We want to get us in the final part.
[1:27:48.280 --> 1:27:50.280]  There really is an Illuminati.
[1:27:50.280 --> 1:27:52.280]  There really are 13 families.
[1:27:52.280 --> 1:27:54.280]  They hold the big banks.
[1:27:54.280 --> 1:27:56.280]  They're in our universities
[1:27:56.280 --> 1:27:58.280]  and they're in our conferences.
[1:27:58.280 --> 1:28:00.280]  And they believe in one world.
[1:28:00.280 --> 1:28:02.280]  And plunge the American people
[1:28:02.280 --> 1:28:04.280]  into the deepest
[1:28:04.280 --> 1:28:06.280]  economic abyss
[1:28:06.280 --> 1:28:08.280]  of a generation.
[1:28:08.280 --> 1:28:10.280]  If we have, or when we have another attack,
[1:28:10.280 --> 1:28:12.280]  it looks like
[1:28:12.280 --> 1:28:14.280]  it will come with more legislation.
[1:28:14.280 --> 1:28:16.280]  Again,
[1:28:16.280 --> 1:28:18.280]  problem reaction solution.
[1:28:18.280 --> 1:28:20.280]  Over and over again,
[1:28:20.280 --> 1:28:22.280]  government, music, pricing,
[1:28:22.280 --> 1:28:24.280]  to scare the population, begin the submission.
[1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:26.280]  That is so important to understand.
[1:28:26.280 --> 1:28:28.280]  Stopping our news,
[1:28:28.280 --> 1:28:30.280]  the approval of a resolution
[1:28:30.280 --> 1:28:32.280]  against the Patriot Act
[1:28:32.280 --> 1:28:34.280]  by the Austin City Council.
[1:28:34.280 --> 1:28:36.280]  The council approved the measure late last night
[1:28:36.280 --> 1:28:38.280]  by a vote of 4-3.
[1:28:38.280 --> 1:28:40.280]  And before making the decision,
[1:28:40.280 --> 1:28:42.280]  council members heard arguments
[1:28:42.280 --> 1:28:44.280]  both for and against the law,
[1:28:44.280 --> 1:28:46.280]  which gives the government more surveillance powers.
[1:28:46.280 --> 1:28:48.280]  Veronica Overgon was following the debate
[1:28:48.280 --> 1:28:50.280]  and brings us the latest details.
[1:28:50.280 --> 1:28:52.280]  It took more than four hours
[1:28:52.280 --> 1:28:54.280]  for the city council members to adopt a resolution
[1:28:54.280 --> 1:28:56.280]  regarding the Patriot Act.
[1:28:56.280 --> 1:28:58.280]  That's because dozens of people
[1:28:58.280 --> 1:29:00.280]  signed up to talk on behalf of the Act
[1:29:00.280 --> 1:29:02.280]  and at one point the meeting got a bit heated.
[1:29:02.280 --> 1:29:04.280]  I personally would like
[1:29:04.280 --> 1:29:06.280]  our large children
[1:29:06.280 --> 1:29:08.280]  to live in a country
[1:29:08.280 --> 1:29:10.280]  where they can have the say
[1:29:10.280 --> 1:29:12.280]  and the control over their lives
[1:29:12.280 --> 1:29:14.280]  and not some corrupt government official
[1:29:14.280 --> 1:29:16.280]  telling them what they can and cannot do.
[1:29:16.280 --> 1:29:18.280]  The USA Patriot Act is unnecessary.
[1:29:18.280 --> 1:29:20.280]  It is insult to Americans.
[1:29:20.280 --> 1:29:22.280]  It is insult to the heritage,
[1:29:22.280 --> 1:29:24.280]  to our heritage
[1:29:24.280 --> 1:29:26.280]  and everyone who has worked together
[1:29:26.280 --> 1:29:28.280]  to create this country.
[1:29:28.280 --> 1:29:30.280]  We're on the march.
[1:29:30.280 --> 1:29:32.280]  The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:32.280 --> 1:29:34.280]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:38.280 --> 1:29:40.280]  A day unlike any other in the long course
[1:29:40.280 --> 1:29:42.280]  of American history,
[1:29:42.280 --> 1:29:44.280]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:29:44.280 --> 1:29:46.280]  The enemies struck America on September 11th.
[1:29:46.280 --> 1:29:48.280]  But who is the enemy?
[1:29:48.280 --> 1:29:50.280]  Bin Laden.
[1:29:50.280 --> 1:29:52.280]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[1:29:52.280 --> 1:29:54.280]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:29:54.280 --> 1:29:56.280]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film
[1:29:56.280 --> 1:29:58.280]  to take a close look at the terrorist ties
[1:29:58.280 --> 1:30:00.280]  to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:30:00.280 --> 1:30:02.280]  Some U.S. investigators believe
[1:30:02.280 --> 1:30:04.280]  that there are Israelis again
[1:30:04.280 --> 1:30:06.280]  very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:30:06.280 --> 1:30:08.280]  I'm aware that
[1:30:08.280 --> 1:30:10.280]  some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:30:10.280 --> 1:30:12.280]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA.
[1:30:12.280 --> 1:30:14.280]  The hijackers' ties to the FBI.
[1:30:14.280 --> 1:30:16.280]  The Saudi Arabian connection.
[1:30:16.280 --> 1:30:18.280]  The Israeli Intelligence Network.
[1:30:18.280 --> 1:30:20.280]  Warnings and war games.
[1:30:20.280 --> 1:30:22.280]  The shadow government.
[1:30:22.280 --> 1:30:24.280]  And much, much more. Fabled Enemies.

[1:30:34.280 --> 1:30:36.280]  or you are with the terrorists.
[1:30:36.280 --> 1:30:38.280]  Did you know
[1:30:38.280 --> 1:30:40.280]  that it's a documented fact
[1:30:40.280 --> 1:30:42.280]  80% of all Americans
[1:30:42.280 --> 1:30:44.280]  and 85% of people around the world
[1:30:44.280 --> 1:30:46.280]  suffer from internal parasites
[1:30:46.280 --> 1:30:48.280]  and infection?
[1:30:48.280 --> 1:30:50.280]  You may be one of millions of people suffering
[1:30:50.280 --> 1:30:52.280]  from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases
[1:30:52.280 --> 1:30:54.280]  from these parasites
[1:30:54.280 --> 1:30:56.280]  and your doctor would never know it.
[1:30:56.280 --> 1:30:58.280]  In fact, clinically detected parasites
[1:30:58.280 --> 1:31:00.280]  account for only 1% of all cases.
[1:31:00.280 --> 1:31:02.280]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[1:31:02.280 --> 1:31:04.280]  Now you can fight internal parasites,
[1:31:04.280 --> 1:31:06.280]  heavy metal poisoning and high cholesterol

[1:33:00.280 --> 1:33:10.280]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[1:33:10.280 --> 1:33:12.280]  Democratic congressman representatives
[1:33:12.280 --> 1:33:14.280]  were threatened with martial law in America
[1:33:14.280 --> 1:33:16.280]  over bailout.
[1:33:16.280 --> 1:33:18.280]  This is not congressman Burgess
[1:33:18.280 --> 1:33:20.280]  who was on this show Monday
[1:33:20.280 --> 1:33:22.280]  being threatened with
[1:33:22.280 --> 1:33:24.280]  what's known as martial law in the house
[1:33:24.280 --> 1:33:26.280]  rarely declared
[1:33:26.280 --> 1:33:28.280]  only a few times in its history
[1:33:28.280 --> 1:33:30.280]  where the chairman
[1:33:30.280 --> 1:33:32.280]  and others restrict debate,
[1:33:32.280 --> 1:33:34.280]  he was thrown out of meetings.
[1:33:34.280 --> 1:33:36.280]  This is physical martial law
[1:33:36.280 --> 1:33:38.280]  Northcom telling
[1:33:38.280 --> 1:33:40.280]  the army telling army times
[1:33:40.280 --> 1:33:42.280]  they're geared up for domestic operations
[1:33:42.280 --> 1:33:44.280]  all the history of this PDD-51
[1:33:44.280 --> 1:33:48.280]  the John Warner Defense Authorization Act
[1:33:48.280 --> 1:33:50.280]  the Military Commissions Act
[1:33:50.280 --> 1:33:52.280]  this is actually happening
[1:33:52.280 --> 1:33:54.280]  this is actually going on
[1:33:54.280 --> 1:33:56.280]  they're being threatened
[1:33:56.280 --> 1:33:58.280]  with economic terrorism
[1:33:58.280 --> 1:34:00.280]  give the treasury secretary
[1:34:00.280 --> 1:34:02.280]  these incredible new powers
[1:34:02.280 --> 1:34:04.280]  no oversight and by the way
[1:34:04.280 --> 1:34:06.280]  that's still in the new bill
[1:34:06.280 --> 1:34:08.280]  or we'll have a depression
[1:34:08.280 --> 1:34:10.280]  and then you see the market drop
[1:34:10.280 --> 1:34:12.280]  $1,200,000,000,000.3
[1:34:12.280 --> 1:34:14.280]  that's economic terrorism
[1:34:14.280 --> 1:34:16.280]  never heard treasury secretaries or presidents say
[1:34:16.280 --> 1:34:18.280]  do this a little bit of depression
[1:34:18.280 --> 1:34:20.280]  and then they had the plunge protection team
[1:34:20.280 --> 1:34:22.280]  stand down Monday and let it fall to terrorize everybody.
[1:34:22.280 --> 1:34:24.280]  Dr. Roberts who ran the treasury
[1:34:24.280 --> 1:34:26.280]  had a policy, number two position
[1:34:26.280 --> 1:34:28.280]  former Wall Street Journal editor
[1:34:28.280 --> 1:34:30.280]  bestselling author, syndicate of Collins
[1:34:30.280 --> 1:34:32.280]  will join us in one minute
[1:34:32.280 --> 1:34:34.280]  but I wanted to play for him
[1:34:34.280 --> 1:34:36.280]  Brad Sherman martial law
[1:34:36.280 --> 1:34:38.280]  now we talked to Ron Paul's office
[1:34:38.280 --> 1:34:40.280]  he's trying to get on here after the debate
[1:34:40.280 --> 1:34:42.280]  right around the time congressman Brad Sherman is coming on
[1:34:42.280 --> 1:34:44.280]  he's confirmed
[1:34:44.280 --> 1:34:46.280]  former congressman Dan Hamburger
[1:34:46.280 --> 1:34:48.280]  who's warned about this in major publications
[1:34:48.280 --> 1:34:50.280]  is coming on as well
[1:34:50.280 --> 1:34:52.280]  but the point here is
[1:34:52.280 --> 1:34:54.280]  and Benton
[1:34:54.280 --> 1:34:56.280]  they thought you mean Burgess
[1:34:56.280 --> 1:34:58.280]  and we said no
[1:34:58.280 --> 1:35:00.280]  of course we're not going to go to Paul and tell him this
[1:35:00.280 --> 1:35:02.280]  but he's checking into it right now
[1:35:02.280 --> 1:35:04.280]  and I talked to other offices saying
[1:35:04.280 --> 1:35:06.280]  yes we've been told this but we're not going to go on record with that
[1:35:06.280 --> 1:35:08.280]  and then we played a clip earlier
[1:35:08.280 --> 1:35:10.280]  and we covered an article earlier where congressman
[1:35:10.280 --> 1:35:12.280]  a few months ago said we can't impeach Bush
[1:35:12.280 --> 1:35:14.280]  or he'll declare martial law we've been told
[1:35:14.280 --> 1:35:16.280]  here is the clip from last night
[1:35:16.280 --> 1:35:18.280]  represented by Brad Sherman martial law
[1:35:18.280 --> 1:35:20.280]  here it is
[1:35:20.280 --> 1:35:22.280]  the only way they can pass this bill
[1:35:22.280 --> 1:35:24.280]  is by creating and sustaining
[1:35:24.280 --> 1:35:26.280]  a panic atmosphere
[1:35:26.280 --> 1:35:28.280]  that atmosphere is not justified
[1:35:28.280 --> 1:35:30.280]  many of us were told
[1:35:30.280 --> 1:35:32.280]  in private conversations
[1:35:32.280 --> 1:35:34.280]  that if we voted against this bill
[1:35:34.280 --> 1:35:36.280]  on Monday
[1:35:36.280 --> 1:35:38.280]  that the sky would fall
[1:35:38.280 --> 1:35:40.280]  the market would drop
[1:35:40.280 --> 1:35:42.280]  two or three thousand points the first day
[1:35:42.280 --> 1:35:44.280]  another couple thousand the second day
[1:35:44.280 --> 1:35:46.280]  and a few members were even told
[1:35:46.280 --> 1:35:48.280]  that there would be martial law
[1:35:48.280 --> 1:35:50.280]  in America if we voted no
[1:35:50.280 --> 1:35:52.280]  that's what I call fear mongering
[1:35:52.280 --> 1:35:54.280]  unjustified
[1:35:54.280 --> 1:35:56.280]  proven wrong
[1:35:56.280 --> 1:35:58.280]  we've got a week we've got two weeks
[1:35:58.280 --> 1:36:00.280]  to write a good bill
[1:36:00.280 --> 1:36:02.280]  the only way to write to pass a bad bill
[1:36:02.280 --> 1:36:04.280]  keep the panic pressure on
[1:36:04.280 --> 1:36:06.280]  now what has the senate done to this bill
[1:36:06.280 --> 1:36:08.280]  now notice that they
[1:36:08.280 --> 1:36:10.280]  activated north com
[1:36:10.280 --> 1:36:12.280]  with brigades not just one if you read carefully
[1:36:12.280 --> 1:36:14.280]  more are coming on October 1st
[1:36:14.280 --> 1:36:16.280]  this is unbelievable
[1:36:16.280 --> 1:36:18.280]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts what do you make of that
[1:36:18.280 --> 1:36:20.280]  well if
[1:36:20.280 --> 1:36:22.280]  if that was a congressman
[1:36:22.280 --> 1:36:24.280]  reporting where on the floor of the house
[1:36:24.280 --> 1:36:26.280]  yeah it's all c-span sir c-span
[1:36:26.280 --> 1:36:28.280]  we have the video
[1:36:28.280 --> 1:36:30.280]  well
[1:36:30.280 --> 1:36:32.280]  obviously
[1:36:32.280 --> 1:36:34.280]  there are using
[1:36:34.280 --> 1:36:36.280]  panic and threats
[1:36:36.280 --> 1:36:38.280]  to get something they want
[1:36:38.280 --> 1:36:40.280]  there's no doubt about it
[1:36:40.280 --> 1:36:42.280]  if that was an accurate report from the US congressman
[1:36:42.280 --> 1:36:44.280]  it's
[1:36:44.280 --> 1:36:46.280]  you know what
[1:36:46.280 --> 1:36:48.280]  what did you say of it I mean it's
[1:36:48.280 --> 1:36:50.280]  it's
[1:36:50.280 --> 1:36:52.280]  it's an enormous
[1:36:52.280 --> 1:36:54.280]  departure
[1:36:54.280 --> 1:36:56.280]  from the way
[1:36:56.280 --> 1:36:58.280]  government works in the United States
[1:36:58.280 --> 1:37:00.280]  and
[1:37:00.280 --> 1:37:02.280]  I just can't
[1:37:02.280 --> 1:37:04.280]  believe they would do something like that
[1:37:04.280 --> 1:37:06.280]  I mean I know they're corrupt and evil and venal
[1:37:06.280 --> 1:37:08.280]  and more criminals
[1:37:08.280 --> 1:37:12.280]  and all the rest but this does seem like it's pushing it
[1:37:12.280 --> 1:37:14.280]  but we keep saying that
[1:37:14.280 --> 1:37:16.280]  when we saw memos about torturing
[1:37:16.280 --> 1:37:18.280]  children from the White House
[1:37:18.280 --> 1:37:20.280]  we didn't believe it then they admitted it
[1:37:20.280 --> 1:37:22.280]  I mean you know all of the things
[1:37:22.280 --> 1:37:24.280]  the anthrax attacks clearly coming out of the White House
[1:37:24.280 --> 1:37:26.280]  it's hard to believe but it's all
[1:37:26.280 --> 1:37:28.280]  really happening
[1:37:30.280 --> 1:37:32.280]  look that way Alex
[1:37:32.280 --> 1:37:34.280]  so they want this bail out
[1:37:34.280 --> 1:37:36.280]  probably
[1:37:36.280 --> 1:37:38.280]  for the power
[1:37:38.280 --> 1:37:40.280]  more than to save the banks
[1:37:40.280 --> 1:37:42.280]  but certainly for the two reasons it looks like
[1:37:42.280 --> 1:37:44.280]  so they're after
[1:37:44.280 --> 1:37:46.280]  this sort of
[1:37:46.280 --> 1:37:48.280]  fascistic
[1:37:48.280 --> 1:37:50.280]  type power over the
[1:37:50.280 --> 1:37:52.280]  financial sector which gives them control
[1:37:52.280 --> 1:37:54.280]  over the whole thing
[1:37:54.280 --> 1:37:56.280]  and
[1:37:56.280 --> 1:37:58.280]  they're bailing out their buddies
[1:37:58.280 --> 1:38:00.280]  that they got in trouble
[1:38:00.280 --> 1:38:02.280]  it was Paulson who talked
[1:38:02.280 --> 1:38:04.280]  the Securities and Exchange Commission
[1:38:04.280 --> 1:38:06.280]  into
[1:38:06.280 --> 1:38:08.280]  obliterating any capital requirements
[1:38:08.280 --> 1:38:10.280]  for their
[1:38:10.280 --> 1:38:12.280]  nebulous financial instruments
[1:38:12.280 --> 1:38:14.280]  so
[1:38:14.280 --> 1:38:16.280]  it looks pretty bad
[1:38:16.280 --> 1:38:18.280]  and I
[1:38:18.280 --> 1:38:20.280]  hope that
[1:38:20.280 --> 1:38:22.280]  the Congress will stand up to them
[1:38:22.280 --> 1:38:24.280]  but I'm not very confident
[1:38:26.280 --> 1:38:28.280]  well Congress has been taught
[1:38:28.280 --> 1:38:30.280]  if they say
[1:38:30.280 --> 1:38:32.280]  even bulk at it
[1:38:32.280 --> 1:38:34.280]  anthrax suddenly hits all the enemies
[1:38:34.280 --> 1:38:36.280]  of the White House
[1:38:36.280 --> 1:38:38.280]  well they have to just risk that
[1:38:38.280 --> 1:38:40.280]  don't they I mean
[1:38:40.280 --> 1:38:42.280]  I think if that happened again
[1:38:44.280 --> 1:38:46.280]  it just looks
[1:38:46.280 --> 1:38:48.280]  it kind of gives the show away
[1:38:48.280 --> 1:38:50.280]  you know plausible
[1:38:50.280 --> 1:38:52.280]  deniability evaporates
[1:38:52.280 --> 1:38:54.280]  with repeated
[1:38:54.280 --> 1:38:56.280]  instances of the same thing
[1:38:56.280 --> 1:38:58.280]  so
[1:38:58.280 --> 1:39:00.280]  hello Alex
[1:39:00.280 --> 1:39:02.280]  I assume
[1:39:02.280 --> 1:39:04.280]  that they just
[1:39:04.280 --> 1:39:06.280]  are using
[1:39:06.280 --> 1:39:08.280]  scare tactics to get the bill passed
[1:39:08.280 --> 1:39:10.280]  and
[1:39:10.280 --> 1:39:12.280]  I'm not it's not
[1:39:12.280 --> 1:39:14.280]  clear to me that
[1:39:14.280 --> 1:39:16.280]  the panic is that bad
[1:39:16.280 --> 1:39:18.280]  and
[1:39:18.280 --> 1:39:20.280]  so I'm not sure
[1:39:20.280 --> 1:39:22.280]  what they're after
[1:39:22.280 --> 1:39:24.280]  why are they doing it
[1:39:24.280 --> 1:39:26.280]  well
[1:39:26.280 --> 1:39:28.280]  it's certainly an escalation
[1:39:28.280 --> 1:39:30.280]  and
[1:39:30.280 --> 1:39:32.280]  they've shown they don't just threaten
[1:39:32.280 --> 1:39:34.280]  they've shown that they're very reckless
[1:39:34.280 --> 1:39:36.280]  very willful a megalomaniacal
[1:39:36.280 --> 1:39:38.280]  look they've shown you and me
[1:39:38.280 --> 1:39:40.280]  and a few others but I don't think
[1:39:40.280 --> 1:39:42.280]  the Congress thinks that the anthrax came
[1:39:42.280 --> 1:39:44.280]  from the government
[1:39:44.280 --> 1:39:46.280]  I don't think they think that
[1:39:46.280 --> 1:39:48.280]  I mean they I think they
[1:39:48.280 --> 1:39:50.280]  kind of believe for the most part
[1:39:50.280 --> 1:39:52.280]  most of them believe the
[1:39:52.280 --> 1:39:54.280]  official story you know
[1:39:54.280 --> 1:39:56.280]  I think that's where
[1:39:56.280 --> 1:39:58.280]  I think if they believe
[1:39:58.280 --> 1:40:00.280]  that they had been attacked by
[1:40:00.280 --> 1:40:02.280]  you know the
[1:40:02.280 --> 1:40:04.280]  genie neocon operation
[1:40:04.280 --> 1:40:06.280]  they probably would have done something
[1:40:06.280 --> 1:40:08.280]  more about it
[1:40:08.280 --> 1:40:10.280]  notice how this lines up and I want your
[1:40:10.280 --> 1:40:12.280]  particular perspective on this
[1:40:12.280 --> 1:40:14.280]  I mean you ran policy at treasury
[1:40:14.280 --> 1:40:16.280]  the number two guy there
[1:40:16.280 --> 1:40:18.280]  the father of Reagan
[1:40:18.280 --> 1:40:20.280] omics
[1:40:20.280 --> 1:40:22.280]  to have
[1:40:22.280 --> 1:40:24.280]  McCain out in all these speeches
[1:40:24.280 --> 1:40:26.280]  saying oh just have the president
[1:40:26.280 --> 1:40:28.280]  have the treasury on their own
[1:40:28.280 --> 1:40:30.280]  have them come up with the money
[1:40:30.280 --> 1:40:32.280]  and he mentioned a few of the mechanisms they have
[1:40:32.280 --> 1:40:34.280]  and then we've been hearing talk about
[1:40:34.280 --> 1:40:36.280]  that you know just do it on your own
[1:40:36.280 --> 1:40:38.280]  if Congress doesn't do it so I think that's
[1:40:38.280 --> 1:40:40.280]  public balloon floating
[1:40:40.280 --> 1:40:42.280]  for
[1:40:42.280 --> 1:40:44.280]  what they're discussing
[1:40:44.280 --> 1:40:46.280]  well
[1:40:46.280 --> 1:40:48.280]  I don't know
[1:40:48.280 --> 1:40:50.280]  whether McCain means
[1:40:50.280 --> 1:40:52.280]  that the president should do it by
[1:40:52.280 --> 1:40:54.280]  eating
[1:40:54.280 --> 1:40:56.280]  or whether he's
[1:40:56.280 --> 1:40:58.280]  you know the federal reserve
[1:40:58.280 --> 1:41:00.280]  has this sort of
[1:41:00.280 --> 1:41:02.280]  what's this new facility they have
[1:41:02.280 --> 1:41:04.280]  I forget what it's called but
[1:41:04.280 --> 1:41:06.280]  the
[1:41:06.280 --> 1:41:08.280]  the
[1:41:08.280 --> 1:41:10.280]  the ability they have
[1:41:10.280 --> 1:41:12.280]  which was
[1:41:12.280 --> 1:41:14.280]  previously you know limited to
[1:41:14.280 --> 1:41:16.280]  commercial banks who would want to
[1:41:16.280 --> 1:41:18.280]  discount the paper
[1:41:18.280 --> 1:41:20.280]  oh yeah the TAF
[1:41:20.280 --> 1:41:22.280]  you know the TAF
[1:41:22.280 --> 1:41:24.280]  this lets the Fed already
[1:41:24.280 --> 1:41:26.280]  take a lot
[1:41:26.280 --> 1:41:28.280]  of these
[1:41:28.280 --> 1:41:30.280]  instruments
[1:41:30.280 --> 1:41:32.280]  it's called a term auction facility
[1:41:32.280 --> 1:41:34.280]  and I think the Fed is already
[1:41:34.280 --> 1:41:36.280]  in effect
[1:41:36.280 --> 1:41:38.280]  doing these things that the bailout
[1:41:38.280 --> 1:41:40.280]  would do
[1:41:40.280 --> 1:41:42.280]  so it may be
[1:41:42.280 --> 1:41:44.280]  under current
[1:41:44.280 --> 1:41:46.280]  laws or the ways they could interpret them
[1:41:46.280 --> 1:41:48.280]  or twist them
[1:41:48.280 --> 1:41:50.280]  that they could actually
[1:41:50.280 --> 1:41:52.280]  proceed
[1:41:52.280 --> 1:41:54.280]  without
[1:41:54.280 --> 1:41:56.280]  turning it into
[1:41:56.280 --> 1:41:58.280]  a bill
[1:41:58.280 --> 1:42:00.280]  now turning it into a bill
[1:42:00.280 --> 1:42:02.280]  gives them more things
[1:42:02.280 --> 1:42:04.280]  that they
[1:42:04.280 --> 1:42:06.280]  won't that they wouldn't get
[1:42:06.280 --> 1:42:08.280]  just by going ahead
[1:42:08.280 --> 1:42:10.280]  using things like the term
[1:42:10.280 --> 1:42:12.280]  auction facility
[1:42:12.280 --> 1:42:14.280]  it gives them
[1:42:14.280 --> 1:42:16.280]  if they get it
[1:42:16.280 --> 1:42:18.280]  no review, no accountability
[1:42:20.280 --> 1:42:22.280]  it lets
[1:42:22.280 --> 1:42:24.280]  them do
[1:42:24.280 --> 1:42:26.280]  other things
[1:42:26.280 --> 1:42:28.280]  that would benefit
[1:42:28.280 --> 1:42:30.280]  the accumulation of
[1:42:30.280 --> 1:42:32.280]  power and executive branch
[1:42:32.280 --> 1:42:34.280]  and which would benefit
[1:42:34.280 --> 1:42:36.280]  the firms that hold these
[1:42:36.280 --> 1:42:38.280]  troubled assets they could actually even come out
[1:42:38.280 --> 1:42:40.280]  making money somehow
[1:42:40.280 --> 1:42:42.280]  so I don't know that
[1:42:42.280 --> 1:42:44.280]  what McCain means is
[1:42:44.280 --> 1:42:46.280]  that the president should
[1:42:46.280 --> 1:42:48.280]  dismiss Congress and start running it
[1:42:48.280 --> 1:42:50.280]  like Caesar
[1:42:50.280 --> 1:42:52.280]  and if that's
[1:42:52.280 --> 1:42:54.280]  what he means I hope nobody
[1:42:54.280 --> 1:42:56.280]  vote for him. Have you heard the clip of him saying
[1:42:56.280 --> 1:42:58.280]  that he aspires to be a dictator?
[1:42:58.280 --> 1:43:00.280]  Well I think
[1:43:00.280 --> 1:43:02.280]  they all do
[1:43:02.280 --> 1:43:04.280]  but they may say that
[1:43:04.280 --> 1:43:06.280]  John there at the network I've gotten so used
[1:43:06.280 --> 1:43:08.280]  to all this tyranny we got that two days
[1:43:08.280 --> 1:43:10.280]  ago I amd it to you
[1:43:10.280 --> 1:43:12.280]  do you have that McCain
[1:43:12.280 --> 1:43:14.280]  that aspires to be a dictator club?
[1:43:14.280 --> 1:43:16.280]  Well just you
[1:43:16.280 --> 1:43:18.280]  but I want to play it. McCain aspires to be a dictator
[1:43:18.280 --> 1:43:20.280]  go ahead Dr. Robertson.
[1:43:20.280 --> 1:43:22.280]  Yeah I think that
[1:43:22.280 --> 1:43:24.280]  they all aspire to be one and they say it
[1:43:24.280 --> 1:43:26.280]  I think in a joking way even though they mean it
[1:43:26.280 --> 1:43:28.280]  but
[1:43:28.280 --> 1:43:30.280]  you know there are a lot of other power centers
[1:43:30.280 --> 1:43:32.280]  that don't
[1:43:32.280 --> 1:43:34.280]  aspire for him to be a dictator
[1:43:34.280 --> 1:43:36.280]  and I just don't
[1:43:36.280 --> 1:43:38.280]  he doesn't have
[1:43:38.280 --> 1:43:40.280]  a Roman army like Caesar had
[1:43:42.280 --> 1:43:44.280]  so
[1:43:44.280 --> 1:43:46.280]  I'm sure that if they could
[1:43:46.280 --> 1:43:48.280]  you know work it by
[1:43:48.280 --> 1:43:50.280]  by degree
[1:43:50.280 --> 1:43:52.280]  a little bit here a little bit there
[1:43:52.280 --> 1:43:54.280]  the president
[1:43:54.280 --> 1:43:56.280]  will end up being a dictator and certainly
[1:43:56.280 --> 1:43:58.280]  we have discussed many times
[1:43:58.280 --> 1:44:00.280]  the many things that the Bush regime
[1:44:00.280 --> 1:44:02.280]  has done to elevate
[1:44:02.280 --> 1:44:04.280]  executive authority and to
[1:44:04.280 --> 1:44:06.280]  create
[1:44:06.280 --> 1:44:08.280]  a lot of movement in the direction
[1:44:08.280 --> 1:44:10.280]  of turning the executive branch into the
[1:44:10.280 --> 1:44:12.280]  ruling branch
[1:44:12.280 --> 1:44:14.280]  totally ruling branch
[1:44:14.280 --> 1:44:16.280]  and I'm sure they'll keep pushing
[1:44:16.280 --> 1:44:18.280]  pushing that
[1:44:18.280 --> 1:44:20.280]  Well that's what PDD 51 does
[1:44:20.280 --> 1:44:22.280]  until the congress you can't even
[1:44:22.280 --> 1:44:24.280]  see our plan but the cover sheet says
[1:44:24.280 --> 1:44:26.280]  the president for any reason including economic
[1:44:26.280 --> 1:44:28.280]  run basically use Northcom
[1:44:28.280 --> 1:44:30.280]  then the army times which is an organ
[1:44:30.280 --> 1:44:32.280]  of the Pentagon he was quote private
[1:44:32.280 --> 1:44:34.280]  it's an organ every word is looked over
[1:44:34.280 --> 1:44:36.280]  right says all we're going to use non-lethal
[1:44:36.280 --> 1:44:38.280]  weapons and we hope we don't have to shoot you
[1:44:38.280 --> 1:44:40.280]  but we're going to be on the streets of America
[1:44:40.280 --> 1:44:42.280]  for civil unrest
[1:44:42.280 --> 1:44:44.280]  right
[1:44:46.280 --> 1:44:48.280]  that's right
[1:44:50.280 --> 1:44:52.280]  man I tell you this is crazy this is only
[1:44:52.280 --> 1:44:54.280]  a one minute clip here is John McCain in a press
[1:44:54.280 --> 1:44:56.280]  conference two days ago
[1:44:56.280 --> 1:44:58.280]  I'm not acceptable
[1:44:58.280 --> 1:45:00.280]  situation
[1:45:00.280 --> 1:45:02.280]  I'm not saying this is the perfect answer
[1:45:02.280 --> 1:45:04.280]  if I were
[1:45:04.280 --> 1:45:06.280]  dictator which I always aspire to be
[1:45:06.280 --> 1:45:08.280]  I would write it
[1:45:08.280 --> 1:45:10.280]  very different a little bit
[1:45:10.280 --> 1:45:12.280]  differently
[1:45:12.280 --> 1:45:14.280]  he doesn't laugh
[1:45:14.280 --> 1:45:16.280]  no one else laughs
[1:45:16.280 --> 1:45:18.280]  yeah that was with the
[1:45:18.280 --> 1:45:20.280]  newspaper the register
[1:45:20.280 --> 1:45:22.280]  and what hour or
[1:45:22.280 --> 1:45:24.280]  Idaho hour maybe
[1:45:24.280 --> 1:45:26.280]  Des Moines
[1:45:26.280 --> 1:45:28.280]  register I think it was
[1:45:28.280 --> 1:45:30.280]  but I think
[1:45:30.280 --> 1:45:32.280]  that
[1:45:32.280 --> 1:45:34.280]  that
[1:45:34.280 --> 1:45:36.280]  I don't think McCain
[1:45:36.280 --> 1:45:38.280]  will become a dictator
[1:45:40.280 --> 1:45:42.280]  if this crisis
[1:45:42.280 --> 1:45:44.280]  was as bad as they're telling
[1:45:44.280 --> 1:45:46.280]  the Congress
[1:45:46.280 --> 1:45:48.280]  you would think that if Bush
[1:45:48.280 --> 1:45:50.280]  wanted to be a dictator he'd just let the thing
[1:45:50.280 --> 1:45:52.280]  continue
[1:45:52.280 --> 1:45:54.280]  and have the crisis materialize
[1:45:54.280 --> 1:45:56.280]  and then use
[1:45:56.280 --> 1:45:58.280]  the PD 51
[1:45:58.280 --> 1:46:00.280]  that he already has
[1:46:00.280 --> 1:46:02.280]  to
[1:46:02.280 --> 1:46:04.280]  take over
[1:46:04.280 --> 1:46:06.280]  Dr. Roberts what is it
[1:46:06.280 --> 1:46:08.280]  when the president and the
[1:46:08.280 --> 1:46:10.280]  Secretary run around and say depression
[1:46:10.280 --> 1:46:12.280]  destruction
[1:46:12.280 --> 1:46:14.280]  Brown says it in Europe
[1:46:14.280 --> 1:46:16.280]  I mean I've never seen leaders do this
[1:46:16.280 --> 1:46:18.280]  this would normally cause a depression
[1:46:18.280 --> 1:46:20.280]  or a massive stock market crash
[1:46:20.280 --> 1:46:22.280]  so it looks like they're actually trying
[1:46:22.280 --> 1:46:24.280]  to speed it along and most market
[1:46:24.280 --> 1:46:26.280]  analysts that we've read and had on the air been saying
[1:46:26.280 --> 1:46:28.280]  that this is financial
[1:46:28.280 --> 1:46:30.280]  terrorism to get what they want
[1:46:30.280 --> 1:46:32.280]  and that it has driven down the market so there you go
[1:46:32.280 --> 1:46:34.280]  yeah well I think
[1:46:34.280 --> 1:46:36.280]  you're right they're using
[1:46:36.280 --> 1:46:38.280]  terrorism
[1:46:38.280 --> 1:46:40.280]  to get what they want just like they did
[1:46:40.280 --> 1:46:42.280]  with the invasion of Iraq
[1:46:42.280 --> 1:46:44.280]  and the invasion
[1:46:44.280 --> 1:46:46.280]  of Afghanistan
[1:46:46.280 --> 1:46:48.280]  and like they've tried to do
[1:46:48.280 --> 1:46:50.280]  to attack Iran
[1:46:50.280 --> 1:46:52.280]  and I'm sure
[1:46:52.280 --> 1:46:54.280]  they're doing that I don't have
[1:46:54.280 --> 1:46:56.280]  any doubt
[1:46:56.280 --> 1:46:58.280]  but that they are
[1:46:58.280 --> 1:47:00.280]  creating
[1:47:00.280 --> 1:47:02.280]  panic and fear
[1:47:02.280 --> 1:47:04.280]  just like they did about weapons and mass destruction
[1:47:04.280 --> 1:47:06.280]  and I doubt that the panic
[1:47:06.280 --> 1:47:08.280]  and fear is justified
[1:47:08.280 --> 1:47:10.280]  on the other hand
[1:47:10.280 --> 1:47:12.280]  Paulson is not an economist
[1:47:12.280 --> 1:47:14.280]  he's just a stock salesman
[1:47:14.280 --> 1:47:16.280]  he's just some kind of a guy that
[1:47:16.280 --> 1:47:18.280]  puts deals together
[1:47:18.280 --> 1:47:20.280]  and the notion that because
[1:47:20.280 --> 1:47:22.280]  he's Trader Secretary
[1:47:22.280 --> 1:47:24.280]  he knows anything
[1:47:24.280 --> 1:47:26.280]  about it is it's not true
[1:47:26.280 --> 1:47:28.280]  the reason Trader Secretaries
[1:47:28.280 --> 1:47:30.280]  have people like me and others
[1:47:30.280 --> 1:47:32.280]  is they don't know anything and they need
[1:47:32.280 --> 1:47:34.280]  somebody there to tell them
[1:47:34.280 --> 1:47:36.280]  well there does seem to be an internal war
[1:47:36.280 --> 1:47:38.280]  we've had a bunch of Fed governors
[1:47:38.280 --> 1:47:40.280]  come out and say this is a horrible bailout
[1:47:40.280 --> 1:47:42.280]  this is a police state
[1:47:42.280 --> 1:47:44.280]  this is wrong, this is too much, I mean it's bizarre
[1:47:44.280 --> 1:47:46.280]  and then meanwhile you have Bernanke
[1:47:46.280 --> 1:47:48.280]  singing in step
[1:47:48.280 --> 1:47:50.280]  with
[1:47:50.280 --> 1:47:52.280]  the parties, Republicans, Democrats, Bush
[1:47:52.280 --> 1:47:54.280]  Paulson saying give us everything we want
[1:47:54.280 --> 1:47:56.280]  or martial law, what is that?
[1:47:58.280 --> 1:48:00.280]  well I think Congress
[1:48:00.280 --> 1:48:02.280]  needs to call the bluff
[1:48:02.280 --> 1:48:04.280]  that's what I think
[1:48:04.280 --> 1:48:06.280]  and then
[1:48:06.280 --> 1:48:08.280]  let's see what happens
[1:48:08.280 --> 1:48:10.280]  there's no point
[1:48:10.280 --> 1:48:12.280]  if they give in
[1:48:12.280 --> 1:48:14.280]  then
[1:48:14.280 --> 1:48:16.280]  they've got martial law, they get what they want
[1:48:16.280 --> 1:48:18.280]  anyhow so
[1:48:18.280 --> 1:48:20.280]  they should just stand up to them
[1:48:20.280 --> 1:48:22.280]  and hold hearings
[1:48:22.280 --> 1:48:24.280]  this whole bailout, look
[1:48:24.280 --> 1:48:26.280]  I can't speculate about this
[1:48:26.280 --> 1:48:28.280]  I'm just disturbed about what you've said
[1:48:28.280 --> 1:48:30.280]  and what I've heard as you are
[1:48:32.280 --> 1:48:34.280]  I think that
[1:48:34.280 --> 1:48:36.280]  where I can speak with
[1:48:36.280 --> 1:48:38.280]  more confidence
[1:48:38.280 --> 1:48:40.280]  is that this bailout
[1:48:40.280 --> 1:48:42.280]  is working
[1:48:42.280 --> 1:48:44.280]  on the wrong end of the problem
[1:48:44.280 --> 1:48:46.280]  it's not going to solve the problem
[1:48:46.280 --> 1:48:48.280]  all the Paulson bailout does
[1:48:48.280 --> 1:48:50.280]  is it takes
[1:48:50.280 --> 1:48:52.280]  the trouble assets
[1:48:52.280 --> 1:48:54.280]  off the bank's books
[1:48:54.280 --> 1:48:56.280]  and puts it on the treasury's books
[1:48:56.280 --> 1:48:58.280]  that's it, it secures the very institutions
[1:48:58.280 --> 1:49:00.280]  that engineered
[1:49:00.280 --> 1:49:02.280]  what is now coming to fruition
[1:49:02.280 --> 1:49:04.280]  and then hands the public the bill
[1:49:04.280 --> 1:49:06.280]  that's the problem
[1:49:06.280 --> 1:49:08.280]  the problem is
[1:49:08.280 --> 1:49:10.280]  the defaulting mortgages
[1:49:10.280 --> 1:49:12.280]  and the defaulting mortgages will continue
[1:49:12.280 --> 1:49:14.280]  so just moving the assets
[1:49:14.280 --> 1:49:16.280]  to another book
[1:49:16.280 --> 1:49:18.280]  doesn't do anything about the problem
[1:49:18.280 --> 1:49:20.280]  which is the foreclosures and the faults
[1:49:20.280 --> 1:49:22.280]  and that is rising
[1:49:22.280 --> 1:49:24.280]  and you can expect it will rise faster
[1:49:24.280 --> 1:49:26.280]  as the economy sinks deeper into this recession
[1:49:26.280 --> 1:49:28.280]  we are already in
[1:49:28.280 --> 1:49:30.280]  a recession is probably going to be a very bad one
[1:49:30.280 --> 1:49:32.280]  and so
[1:49:32.280 --> 1:49:34.280]  the Paulson bailout
[1:49:34.280 --> 1:49:36.280]  does nothing about the problem
[1:49:36.280 --> 1:49:38.280]  it just
[1:49:38.280 --> 1:49:40.280]  moves it from one set of books to the others
[1:49:40.280 --> 1:49:42.280]  and the problem will continue
[1:49:42.280 --> 1:49:44.280]  and so the way
[1:49:44.280 --> 1:49:46.280]  you would address this
[1:49:46.280 --> 1:49:48.280]  is to go where the problem is
[1:49:48.280 --> 1:49:50.280]  and that is the homeowners
[1:49:50.280 --> 1:49:52.280]  now what they did in the great depression
[1:49:52.280 --> 1:49:54.280]  they created the
[1:49:54.280 --> 1:49:56.280]  homeowners loan corporation
[1:49:56.280 --> 1:49:58.280]  and the federal government
[1:49:58.280 --> 1:50:00.280]  went in and refinanced
[1:50:00.280 --> 1:50:02.280]  all the mortgages that were in trouble
[1:50:02.280 --> 1:50:04.280]  I think it was something like a quarter
[1:50:04.280 --> 1:50:06.280]  of all the mortgages in the United States
[1:50:06.280 --> 1:50:08.280]  they refinanced it
[1:50:08.280 --> 1:50:10.280]  and took the pressure
[1:50:10.280 --> 1:50:12.280]  off
[1:50:12.280 --> 1:50:14.280]  the markets
[1:50:14.280 --> 1:50:16.280]  because they refinanced the mortgages
[1:50:16.280 --> 1:50:18.280]  and when the homeowners loan corporation
[1:50:18.280 --> 1:50:20.280]  closed this book
[1:50:20.280 --> 1:50:22.280]  I think in 1951
[1:50:22.280 --> 1:50:24.280]  they had turned the profit
[1:50:24.280 --> 1:50:26.280]  stay there final segment Dr. Paul Grun Roberts
[1:50:26.280 --> 1:50:28.280]  more on the economy end
[1:50:28.280 --> 1:50:30.280]  not just the martial law
[1:50:30.280 --> 1:50:32.280]  but what he said about if they passed this bailout bill
[1:50:32.280 --> 1:50:34.280]  they get economic martial law power
[1:50:34.280 --> 1:50:40.280]  it's happening
[1:51:04.280 --> 1:51:06.280]  when to be not secure

[1:51:40.280 --> 1:51:42.280]  along with hundreds of my fellow troops
[1:51:42.280 --> 1:51:44.280]  I went to grounds here and we knew
[1:51:44.280 --> 1:51:46.280]  what to do
[1:51:46.280 --> 1:51:48.280]  at least we thought we did

[1:53:44.280 --> 1:53:46.280]  the house
[1:53:46.280 --> 1:53:48.280]  just passed
[1:53:48.280 --> 1:53:50.280]  the banker
[1:53:50.280 --> 1:53:52.280]  takeover bill
[1:53:52.280 --> 1:53:54.280]  last night this morning
[1:53:54.280 --> 1:53:56.280]  the Washington Post said sweeping
[1:53:56.280 --> 1:53:58.280]  the dictatorial powers
[1:53:58.280 --> 1:54:00.280]  for the treasury to buy any assets
[1:54:00.280 --> 1:54:02.280]  basically do whatever they want no oversight
[1:54:02.280 --> 1:54:04.280]  no immunity
[1:54:04.280 --> 1:54:06.280]  they just set up some
[1:54:06.280 --> 1:54:08.280]  puppet boards
[1:54:08.280 --> 1:54:10.280]  set up by the executive through Paulson
[1:54:10.280 --> 1:54:12.280]  just unbelievable
[1:54:12.280 --> 1:54:14.280]  it has now passed
[1:54:14.280 --> 1:54:16.280]  ladies and gentlemen it says passed in hold
[1:54:16.280 --> 1:54:18.280]  and it was just filled
[1:54:18.280 --> 1:54:20.280]  with carbon taxes
[1:54:20.280 --> 1:54:22.280]  and pork marrow and good God
[1:54:22.280 --> 1:54:24.280]  Dr. Roberts we're really blessed to have a former
[1:54:24.280 --> 1:54:26.280]  head of policy department
[1:54:26.280 --> 1:54:28.280]  of treasury under Ronald Reagan
[1:54:28.280 --> 1:54:30.280]  on with us and former Wall Street Journal editor
[1:54:30.280 --> 1:54:32.280]  sir your take on this happening
[1:54:32.280 --> 1:54:34.280]  well it's a mistake
[1:54:34.280 --> 1:54:36.280]  it's a mistake
[1:54:36.280 --> 1:54:38.280]  and it'll probably
[1:54:38.280 --> 1:54:40.280]  lead to
[1:54:40.280 --> 1:54:42.280]  unanticipated
[1:54:42.280 --> 1:54:44.280]  problems unintended consequences
[1:54:44.280 --> 1:54:46.280]  and
[1:54:46.280 --> 1:54:48.280]  it's not gonna
[1:54:48.280 --> 1:54:50.280]  in fact I see the market has just
[1:54:50.280 --> 1:54:52.280]  dropped in half it was on a big rally
[1:54:52.280 --> 1:54:54.280]  and now it's dropped in half
[1:54:54.280 --> 1:54:56.280]  maybe that's in
[1:54:56.280 --> 1:54:58.280]  response to the passage
[1:54:58.280 --> 1:55:00.280]  but
[1:55:00.280 --> 1:55:02.280]  the market which was up
[1:55:02.280 --> 1:55:04.280]  225
[1:55:04.280 --> 1:55:06.280]  points is now up 114
[1:55:06.280 --> 1:55:08.280]  and
[1:55:08.280 --> 1:55:10.280]  prices
[1:55:10.280 --> 1:55:12.280]  dropped across the board
[1:55:12.280 --> 1:55:14.280]  so
[1:55:14.280 --> 1:55:16.280]  if that's
[1:55:16.280 --> 1:55:18.280]  the market response to the bill
[1:55:18.280 --> 1:55:20.280]  and already
[1:55:20.280 --> 1:55:22.280]  that tells you
[1:55:22.280 --> 1:55:24.280]  something look Alex
[1:55:24.280 --> 1:55:26.280]  governments make enormous mistakes in fact
[1:55:26.280 --> 1:55:28.280]  most of what they do
[1:55:28.280 --> 1:55:30.280]  is a mistake
[1:55:30.280 --> 1:55:32.280]  and
[1:55:32.280 --> 1:55:34.280]  that's how we got the great depression
[1:55:34.280 --> 1:55:36.280]  it was a government mistake
[1:55:36.280 --> 1:55:38.280]  they just so happen to have all this Marshall
[1:55:38.280 --> 1:55:40.280]  lost up geared up and
[1:55:40.280 --> 1:55:42.280]  they've got it
[1:55:42.280 --> 1:55:44.280]  I don't know what they're
[1:55:44.280 --> 1:55:46.280]  up to Alex but you know
[1:55:46.280 --> 1:55:48.280]  the thing that keeps coming
[1:55:48.280 --> 1:55:50.280]  back to me is that
[1:55:50.280 --> 1:55:52.280]  they don't have
[1:55:52.280 --> 1:55:54.280]  the troops
[1:55:54.280 --> 1:55:56.280]  and they haven't got any money
[1:55:56.280 --> 1:55:58.280]  this bill out the other markets going down
[1:55:58.280 --> 1:56:00.280]  they just passed a trillion
[1:56:00.280 --> 1:56:02.280]  plus dollar defense budget
[1:56:02.280 --> 1:56:04.280]  six years ago it was
[1:56:04.280 --> 1:56:06.280]  400 and something billion I mean
[1:56:06.280 --> 1:56:08.280]  it just sits out of control
[1:56:08.280 --> 1:56:10.280]  well Alex let's talk
[1:56:10.280 --> 1:56:12.280]  about the details of it now
[1:56:12.280 --> 1:56:14.280]  this
[1:56:14.280 --> 1:56:16.280]  bill out which
[1:56:16.280 --> 1:56:18.280]  I think then it didn't increase
[1:56:18.280 --> 1:56:20.280]  from 700 billion to 850
[1:56:20.280 --> 1:56:22.280]  billion and then it's got
[1:56:22.280 --> 1:56:24.280]  absolutely open line of 841
[1:56:24.280 --> 1:56:26.280]  billion okay so
[1:56:26.280 --> 1:56:28.280]  that has to be
[1:56:28.280 --> 1:56:30.280]  I think near term borrowing because
[1:56:30.280 --> 1:56:32.280]  this is a near term crisis this isn't
[1:56:32.280 --> 1:56:34.280]  something going to draw down over 10 or
[1:56:34.280 --> 1:56:36.280]  20 years so all
[1:56:36.280 --> 1:56:38.280]  of that the church doesn't have
[1:56:38.280 --> 1:56:40.280]  any money it's got eight dollars
[1:56:40.280 --> 1:56:42.280]  much less 800 billion so all that has
[1:56:42.280 --> 1:56:44.280]  to be barred it's got to be barred on
[1:56:44.280 --> 1:56:46.280]  top of a record budget deficit
[1:56:48.280 --> 1:56:50.280]  and the record budget deficit
[1:56:50.280 --> 1:56:52.280]  itself is understated
[1:56:52.280 --> 1:56:54.280]  because it's based on the assumption
[1:56:54.280 --> 1:56:56.280]  of no recession
[1:56:56.280 --> 1:56:58.280]  and we're in a recession and the world
[1:56:58.280 --> 1:57:00.280]  is already starting to
[1:57:00.280 --> 1:57:02.280]  buy more debt
[1:57:02.280 --> 1:57:04.280]  Alex so now
[1:57:04.280 --> 1:57:06.280]  if you're a far
[1:57:06.280 --> 1:57:08.280]  if you're the foreign creditors and you used
[1:57:08.280 --> 1:57:10.280]  to say lending us
[1:57:10.280 --> 1:57:12.280]  200 billion every year to finance
[1:57:12.280 --> 1:57:14.280]  the budget deficit and then the budget
[1:57:14.280 --> 1:57:16.280]  deficit goes to 450 at a
[1:57:16.280 --> 1:57:18.280]  minimum maybe more likely
[1:57:18.280 --> 1:57:20.280]  600
[1:57:20.280 --> 1:57:22.280]  billion dollars
[1:57:22.280 --> 1:57:24.280]  so it's tripled
[1:57:24.280 --> 1:57:26.280]  and then you add on top of that another
[1:57:26.280 --> 1:57:28.280]  800 billion so you know it's
[1:57:28.280 --> 1:57:30.280]  more than Quinn tripled the credit
[1:57:30.280 --> 1:57:32.280]  demands that we're
[1:57:32.280 --> 1:57:34.280]  giving to our foreign bankers
[1:57:34.280 --> 1:57:36.280]  now what are they going to blink
[1:57:36.280 --> 1:57:38.280]  are they going to say well
[1:57:38.280 --> 1:57:40.280]  what's going to happen to the treasuries
[1:57:40.280 --> 1:57:42.280]  on credit rating
[1:57:42.280 --> 1:57:44.280]  when it has to take so
[1:57:44.280 --> 1:57:46.280]  much debt to market
[1:57:46.280 --> 1:57:48.280]  you see what I'm saying I don't think
[1:57:48.280 --> 1:57:50.280]  they've thought about any of this
[1:57:50.280 --> 1:57:52.280]  and the reason they don't think about it is they're
[1:57:52.280 --> 1:57:54.280]  fully hubris they think you know
[1:57:54.280 --> 1:57:56.280]  that we're the superpower
[1:57:56.280 --> 1:57:58.280]  they have all these imaginary
[1:57:58.280 --> 1:58:00.280]  imaginary existences for
[1:58:00.280 --> 1:58:02.280]  themselves so we don't know
[1:58:02.280 --> 1:58:04.280]  what the
[1:58:04.280 --> 1:58:06.280]  response will be now if
[1:58:06.280 --> 1:58:08.280]  the foreigners don't lend the money they got
[1:58:08.280 --> 1:58:10.280]  printed. Dr. Roberts do five more minutes
[1:58:10.280 --> 1:58:12.280]  60 second break half day in the shower
[1:58:12.280 --> 1:58:14.280]  we've got three congressmen
[1:58:14.280 --> 1:58:16.280]  lined up and coming up
[1:58:18.280 --> 1:58:20.280]  thank you for listening to GCN

[1:58:24.280 --> 1:58:26.280]  today
[1:58:28.280 --> 1:58:30.280]  unlike any other in the long course
[1:58:30.280 --> 1:58:32.280]  of American history a terrorist act
[1:58:32.280 --> 1:58:34.280]  of war against this country
[1:58:34.280 --> 1:58:36.280]  the enemies struck America on September
[1:58:36.280 --> 1:58:38.280]  11th but who is the enemy
[1:58:38.280 --> 1:58:40.280]  bin Laden this is his ammo
[1:58:40.280 --> 1:58:42.280]  we have to look to the Middle East
[1:58:42.280 --> 1:58:44.280]  we have to look to Osama bin Laden
[1:58:44.280 --> 1:58:46.280]  fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film
[1:58:46.280 --> 1:58:48.280]  to take a close look at the terrorist ties
[1:58:48.280 --> 1:58:50.280]  to intelligence networks inside the United States
[1:58:50.280 --> 1:58:52.280]  some US investigators
[1:58:52.280 --> 1:58:54.280]  believe that there are Israelis again
[1:58:54.280 --> 1:58:56.280]  very much engaged in spying in
[1:58:56.280 --> 1:58:58.280]  and on the US
[1:58:58.280 --> 1:59:00.280]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens
[1:59:00.280 --> 1:59:02.280]  have been detained
[1:59:02.280 --> 1:59:04.280]  bin Laden's connections to the CIA
[1:59:04.280 --> 1:59:06.280]  the hijackers ties to the FBI

[1:59:50.280 --> 1:59:53.280]  he is Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[1:59:53.280 --> 1:59:58.280]  network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:59:58.280 --> 2:00:03.560]  All right, we're 90% we're on call on the next two hours. 100% Congressman Dan
[2:00:03.560 --> 2:00:10.000]  Hamburg, 100% Congressman Brad Sherman for stations just joining us. They told
[2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:13.720]  them martial law will be declared in the United States physically if House
[2:00:13.720 --> 2:00:18.280]  members don't pass this. Well, they just did T-minus eight minutes ago. The vote
[2:00:18.280 --> 2:00:21.520]  was eight minutes ago, they passed it eight minutes ago. We got four minutes
[2:00:21.520 --> 2:00:24.800]  left with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts. During the one minute break we were talking
[2:00:24.800 --> 2:00:27.880]  about this is leading to complete disaster. The troops won't be able to
[2:00:27.880 --> 2:00:31.120]  carry out martial law because their poor families are going to be starving. Same
[2:00:31.120 --> 2:00:37.780]  thing with cops. Finish up sir with what with now where you see this going? Well,
[2:00:37.780 --> 2:00:42.520]  I think one of the biggest test is going to be the response of foreign
[2:00:42.520 --> 2:00:50.160]  creditors to the Treasury's assumption of enormous new debt responsibilities. You
[2:00:50.160 --> 2:00:53.040]  know, the world's already flooded with dollars, you know, the dollar's been
[2:00:53.040 --> 2:00:57.120]  losing value in relation to other currencies, in relation to precious
[2:00:57.120 --> 2:01:02.400]  metals, in relation to oil, because there's already too much United States
[2:01:02.400 --> 2:01:08.160]  government debt, too many dollars, too big of a trade deficit. Now the
[2:01:08.160 --> 2:01:12.840]  budget deficit is huge and recession is hitting it. It will grow. Now they're
[2:01:12.840 --> 2:01:17.800]  going to come up and need to borrow another $800 billion from foreign
[2:01:17.800 --> 2:01:24.920]  creditors. So the test is will they lend or will they lend at the low interest
[2:01:24.920 --> 2:01:30.320]  rates that the bailout really needs in order to be successful. This is going
[2:01:30.320 --> 2:01:35.080]  this is going to be a big test. I don't think they've thought about that. What
[2:01:35.080 --> 2:01:38.040]  about all the credit card debt coming due to? I mean the real economy is
[2:01:38.040 --> 2:01:42.400]  screwed. Well, that's right. We what is what is really coming out of this
[2:01:42.400 --> 2:01:49.160]  financial crisis is concentration. We see financial concentration. We're going
[2:01:49.160 --> 2:01:54.240]  to end up with three banks. Bank of America, you know, Wells Fargo,
[2:01:54.240 --> 2:02:02.680]  the Wachovia, and Citicorp. And we're four banks and Chase and JP Morgan Chase.
[2:02:02.680 --> 2:02:09.440]  So we'll have four giant banks. It'll be Monopoly Capitalism and it's so funny
[2:02:09.440 --> 2:02:14.160]  because it's come out of deregulation. It's come out of a market
[2:02:14.160 --> 2:02:21.000]  ideology. And so we see that the result of Phil Graham and Newt Gingrich and
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:25.880]  and all of that is Monopoly Capitalism. The method to the madness though. They
[2:02:25.880 --> 2:02:29.360]  don't they want to rule. It's like Satan. I'd rather rule in hell than serve in
[2:02:29.360 --> 2:02:33.200]  heaven and they think they're in control of it. They want to rule a dung heap
[2:02:33.200 --> 2:02:39.280]  instead of the paradise this country was. Well, maybe that's it. I don't you know
[2:02:39.280 --> 2:02:45.120]  the Russian president the other the other day said quite truthfully in my
[2:02:45.120 --> 2:02:52.600]  opinion that the era of American dominance is over. Yep. And I think that's
[2:02:52.600 --> 2:02:58.720]  true. And I think that we also had the German Foreign Minister also say the
[2:02:58.720 --> 2:03:03.280]  same thing and that the dollar that the dollar would be dethroned as reserve
[2:03:03.280 --> 2:03:07.120]  currency. So then what they're gonna do is they're gonna end up with a lot of
[2:03:07.120 --> 2:03:14.440]  debts that they're not going to be able to pay in US dollars because the dollar
[2:03:14.440 --> 2:03:18.600]  loses its reserve currency role. You can no longer pay your bills and your own
[2:03:18.600 --> 2:03:25.880]  currency. So it looks to me like they're gonna impoverish the country. They are
[2:03:25.880 --> 2:03:30.000]  gonna probably produce a lot of civil unrest and I don't know that they have
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:37.200]  the physical means to contain it. So I don't know what the outcome is but
[2:03:37.200 --> 2:03:43.680]  this bill is not going to be the end of the problem. It may it may simply cause
[2:03:43.680 --> 2:03:48.920]  worse problems and as I said earlier in our interview today it does not address
[2:03:48.920 --> 2:03:54.160]  the default rate. I mean people are defaulting on the mortgages and that's
[2:03:54.160 --> 2:03:58.960]  the problem and the bill does nothing to stop that. So that is going to
[2:03:58.960 --> 2:04:03.120]  continue. It only protects the bankers. It only protects and it'll destroy them
[2:04:03.120 --> 2:04:06.280]  in the end. In closing I appreciate you joining us sir. We'll talk to you in the
[2:04:06.280 --> 2:04:10.960]  near future as new book is out the turning of good intentions now in a
[2:04:10.960 --> 2:04:15.160]  updated version but meanwhile a lot of the yuppies I talked to laugh and giggle
[2:04:15.160 --> 2:04:19.040]  and think it's all funny. They have no idea of what's happened as well. There's
[2:04:19.040 --> 2:04:22.200]  just a lot of hubris not just by the elite but by the general public. Dr.

[2:07:49.920 --> 2:07:59.800]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:07:59.800 --> 2:08:06.080]  Congressman Dan Hamburg, who a year ago wrote a story for the San Francisco Chronicle
[2:08:06.080 --> 2:08:09.880]  to detail the plans for martial law takeover during an economic controlled
[2:08:09.880 --> 2:08:17.440]  enclosure. People join us in T-minus 22 minutes. Ron Paul, we're very close to
[2:08:17.440 --> 2:08:20.280]  getting him on. He just just having to deal with the vote and now with a ton of
[2:08:20.280 --> 2:08:26.520]  media fighting his way in here. In fact, Trey, call him again. Stuff happened like
[2:08:26.520 --> 2:08:29.640]  me on the phone with Ron Paul and the cord comes out of the phone and this
[2:08:29.640 --> 2:08:33.680]  office is everything falls apart. It's like a landcrawler in here. We've got
[2:08:33.680 --> 2:08:40.800]  that going on. Congressman Brad Sherman is coming up. 250-in-ish is what it
[2:08:40.800 --> 2:08:45.960]  says. I know that was also crazy. The vote is over though. It came earlier and they
[2:08:45.960 --> 2:08:50.720]  thought. So Trey, go ahead and call them and adjust if Congressman Brad
[2:08:50.720 --> 2:08:54.240]  Sherman wants to come on earlier. He's already agreed but I don't want to wait
[2:08:54.240 --> 2:09:00.720]  an hour and five minutes. I bet because the vote's over he can come in now. We'll
[2:09:00.720 --> 2:09:06.000]  see what happens. Just stay with us. For those that just joined us, the Democratic
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:09.240]  Congress and representatives were threatened with martial law, nationwide
[2:09:09.240 --> 2:09:16.520]  martial law, not just in Congress. Eve, American, bailout. Again, Democratic
[2:09:16.520 --> 2:09:19.480]  Congress representatives were threatened with martial law in America over bailout.
[2:09:19.480 --> 2:09:24.720]  That's the infowars.com, prisonplanet.com headline. Actually, that story is
[2:09:24.720 --> 2:09:29.240]  from prisonplanet.com separately by Steve Watson. It covers some of the facets
[2:09:29.240 --> 2:09:39.400]  and then on infowars.com there is another story that is up there that comes
[2:09:39.400 --> 2:09:44.000]  from Curt Nimmo, the first one out on this this morning. There's the video of
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:47.800]  this being said. Martial law will be declared a banker bailout not passed in
[2:09:47.800 --> 2:09:53.760]  House. Now we need to say, headline, Congress threatened with martial law is
[2:09:53.760 --> 2:10:00.040]  terrorized into passing bill. Martial law, Congress, House terrorized with
[2:10:00.040 --> 2:10:03.360]  threat of martial law. This would be the headline. I don't care if Steve Watson,
[2:10:03.360 --> 2:10:08.200]  Paul Watson, Curt Nimmo, Aaron Dykes are limited writers. We need it up there
[2:10:08.200 --> 2:10:12.680]  now. That is the bottom line now. And then just basically take the info and the
[2:10:12.680 --> 2:10:16.240]  other two stories and rehash it there but add the new information. And you heard
[2:10:16.240 --> 2:10:19.920]  the former head of policy, Department of Treasury, just say this bill
[2:10:19.920 --> 2:10:24.880]  effectively creates economic martial law through the Treasury with the private
[2:10:24.880 --> 2:10:31.440]  banks. So we just got martial law and the magnitude of it isn't even properly
[2:10:31.440 --> 2:10:36.480]  affecting me. We live so close to this problem here that it's actually happening
[2:10:36.480 --> 2:10:44.760]  and now we don't even see it for what it is. Let me explain that again. House of
[2:10:44.760 --> 2:10:54.160]  Representatives terrorized by threat of martial law passes banker empowerment
[2:10:54.160 --> 2:10:57.760]  bill that sets up financial dictatorship in the United States. That is the main
[2:10:57.760 --> 2:11:02.000]  headline and sub-headline. That is what it is. So we're going to give you martial
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:05.200]  law unless you give us martial law powers because they didn't want that
[2:11:05.200 --> 2:11:08.080]  confrontation. They didn't want to have it come out in the open. So they said we
[2:11:08.080 --> 2:11:13.400]  got North com standing right by. We got the anthrax packages right now. We'll
[2:11:13.400 --> 2:11:17.240]  tell them the guys with the beers and the turbines did it. You pass this right
[2:11:17.240 --> 2:11:22.680]  now. We activate North com. The brigade standing by Colorado Springs. We'll bring
[2:11:22.680 --> 2:11:30.160]  them into Washington. Unbelievable. And now you heard about the Roberts. All this
[2:11:30.160 --> 2:11:34.080]  does is to protect the banks and it will implode the real economy. Now they're
[2:11:34.080 --> 2:11:36.680]  going to kill the economy and the market knows that's why it's plunging right
[2:11:36.680 --> 2:11:45.400]  now. They terrorized Congress into this. This is horrible. Man excuse me. Let's
[2:11:45.400 --> 2:11:49.120]  go to Steve Shank. He was set up for the show and boy what a crazy day to have him
[2:11:49.120 --> 2:11:53.520]  on. He set up days ago. I appreciate letting him move into a little bit
[2:11:53.520 --> 2:11:57.200]  later because I was too busy early on to even have him on today though. It's vital.
[2:11:57.200 --> 2:12:00.860]  And Steve I got so busy I didn't put in the order a couple weeks ago when you
[2:12:00.860 --> 2:12:05.760]  were last gone. I want a year's supply for three people. Another one. I hope I
[2:12:05.760 --> 2:12:10.600]  can get it in time. How fast can you ship it to me? Just just bill me. You just get
[2:12:10.600 --> 2:12:16.200]  it to me. It's already being billed Alex. I assume that that's what we needed
[2:12:16.200 --> 2:12:24.080]  after our last conversation. But Alex I got to I got to I got to talk. Okay one
[2:12:24.080 --> 2:12:33.320]  of the any jackasses with 90% of the people calling these people telling
[2:12:33.320 --> 2:12:37.760]  them no and they go ahead and do it anyway. This is the most phenomenal act
[2:12:37.760 --> 2:12:42.280]  of treason that's ever been perpetrated in this country and I don't know why we
[2:12:42.280 --> 2:12:46.200]  can't just impeach the whole stink in Congress of the United States and the
[2:12:46.200 --> 2:12:50.840]  whole mess. But the mechanism is controlled isn't it? It's protected. They protect
[2:12:50.840 --> 2:12:54.800]  themselves and I'll guarantee this bill protects them. If you'd have heard Glenn
[2:12:54.800 --> 2:13:00.200]  Beck did a marvelous job last night of going through some of the issues. They
[2:13:00.200 --> 2:13:05.520]  are setting aside millions of dollars for research on wooden arrows for toys. But
[2:13:05.520 --> 2:13:10.000]  let me tell you that is the important but it's the diversion that the media is
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:14.560]  covering the pork barrel and the wooden arrows and carbon taxes. The real
[2:13:14.560 --> 2:13:19.440]  issue is it gives immunity and dictatorial power to the Treasury. Absolutely.
[2:13:19.440 --> 2:13:23.360]  And immunity to all of these characters. I'll guarantee you that's built in there
[2:13:23.360 --> 2:13:27.160]  but let's now that we have the subsection you're absolutely right. Let's
[2:13:27.160 --> 2:13:31.640]  talk about what we're dealing with. You and I have been telling these folks that
[2:13:31.640 --> 2:13:36.520]  with the economy going as it was with the shortages of food, the starvation
[2:13:36.520 --> 2:13:40.400]  worldwide and everything that they had to take. By the way, food riots exploded
[2:13:40.400 --> 2:13:45.280]  worldwide this week. It's intensifying. You were right. I was wrong. I keep
[2:13:45.280 --> 2:13:49.360]  thinking it's not as bad as people are saying. Well let me tell you how bad
[2:13:49.360 --> 2:13:54.800]  this thing is. They're talking martial law. The Second Patriot Act. If they have
[2:13:54.800 --> 2:13:59.200]  any reason or excuse to have a national emergency and martial law is it,
[2:13:59.200 --> 2:14:04.320]  they have the power and they will take over distribution of food. Now our
[2:14:04.320 --> 2:14:08.200]  warehouse is buying like crazy trying to get every morsel of food they can get in
[2:14:08.200 --> 2:14:13.440]  there but it's not going to do one stink and bit of good if they pull a plug on
[2:14:13.440 --> 2:14:17.800]  this thing and get runaway inflation going on. What happens with runaway
[2:14:17.800 --> 2:14:22.880]  inflation, Alex? Prices explode. They absolutely explode and unless people
[2:14:22.880 --> 2:14:27.480]  have the stuff that they need already bought, even if it's on a stink and
[2:14:27.480 --> 2:14:32.000]  credit card, that will fix the cost and they can pay for it with cheap money. But
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:37.200]  the fact is that if our families out there get caught with either martial law
[2:14:37.200 --> 2:14:41.120]  or the runaway inflation when they start when they start filtering this
[2:14:41.120 --> 2:14:47.720]  700 billion down through the the monetary system, they will not buy food.
[2:14:47.720 --> 2:14:52.320]  Let me tell listeners what it looks like. Every time there's a hurricane in
[2:14:52.320 --> 2:14:56.640]  Texas, the three million illegal aliens, that's how many are in South Texas,
[2:14:56.640 --> 2:15:01.400]  flood all little towns, neighborhoods, it's a fact, robbing, stealing. I was at a
[2:15:01.400 --> 2:15:04.800]  grocery store in Buffalo, Texas during the hurricane. There were thousands of
[2:15:04.800 --> 2:15:08.680]  illegal aliens roving around. People coming into the gun shop, I was at buying
[2:15:08.680 --> 2:15:13.440]  more ammo across the street in Buffalo. Buffalo Sporting Goods is the name of it.
[2:15:13.440 --> 2:15:17.960]  But you can ask folks in Buffalo, it's on I-45 in between Dallas and Houston,
[2:15:17.960 --> 2:15:22.040]  coming in saying, my wallet got stolen out of my car. My car got robbed. Folks, it's
[2:15:22.040 --> 2:15:26.840]  gonna look much worse than that. Well, I tell you what, as a result of the
[2:15:26.840 --> 2:15:32.200]  runaway inflation that this absolutely insures, as a result of the martial law,
[2:15:32.200 --> 2:15:36.240]  this absolutely insures, there are two things that people better dadgum well do.
[2:15:36.240 --> 2:15:39.760]  They better get their 12 gauge set up behind the door with plenty of ammunition
[2:15:39.760 --> 2:15:42.800]  and they better get about three or four years worth of food and they better do
[2:15:42.800 --> 2:15:48.560]  it now. We're at capacity but we're we're doubling up. I'm telling you,
[2:15:48.560 --> 2:15:53.640]  this thing is the death knell to the country, absolutely. And the only way
[2:15:53.640 --> 2:15:57.520]  families are going to survive is if these people take control and get their
[2:15:57.520 --> 2:16:01.760]  own food, you cannot trust these people to your survival. They're absolutely
[2:16:01.760 --> 2:16:04.440]  criminals. I don't know whether you get it from J. Michael Stevens Group and
[2:16:04.440 --> 2:16:08.800]  E-Foods Director, not you go get food. Don't buy the can, junk out of the grocery
[2:16:08.800 --> 2:16:13.000]  store, you got to get storable stuff, but get food wherever you can get it. Give us
[2:16:13.000 --> 2:16:18.240]  a call just as soon as you can, 800-409-5633. I need these dadgum full-nines
[2:16:18.240 --> 2:16:27.320]  flooded. We'll gear up, but I'm telling you Alex, this is absolutely, if there's
[2:16:27.320 --> 2:16:32.280]  one damn bit of patriotism in any of our families out there, they got to move to
[2:16:32.280 --> 2:16:36.040]  survive because unless these families survive, we won't have people left to
[2:16:36.040 --> 2:16:40.720]  take this thing back when it goes down. Well that's the good news, the silver
[2:16:40.720 --> 2:16:44.440]  lining throughout history with remnants. God warns us people, people that you know
[2:16:44.440 --> 2:16:47.800]  read the Bible, they know that you've always got to be prepared, they follow
[2:16:47.800 --> 2:16:51.720]  that and they're always a lot better off than the wicked that laugh at us and
[2:16:51.720 --> 2:16:55.480]  some people are still laughing, Steve, and I just can't believe their
[2:16:55.480 --> 2:17:00.800]  ignorance. Well I can, I can, I guess I can believe it. I see what we've got
[2:17:00.800 --> 2:17:06.560]  running for president both ways, but the fact is, is that this issue this
[2:17:06.560 --> 2:17:13.000]  morning, I can't emphasize to our listeners enough, Alex, they absolutely
[2:17:13.000 --> 2:17:19.000]  must move now. Every asset, resource they can put together, food is going to be
[2:17:19.000 --> 2:17:23.560]  the only medium of exchange. Hey, I get so bad, I get so busy fighting them that I
[2:17:23.560 --> 2:17:27.400]  that I've bought food for family and stuff that didn't care, didn't know, now
[2:17:27.400 --> 2:17:31.080]  they appreciate it. I bought food for family that did know but couldn't afford
[2:17:31.080 --> 2:17:34.080]  it and so I don't even have enough for myself, you know, I've bought many times
[2:17:34.080 --> 2:17:40.080]  from you, but listen, you put me first in a three-year supply, I can only
[2:17:40.080 --> 2:17:43.560]  afford a two-year supply for three people. No, we got three years packed and on
[2:17:43.560 --> 2:17:48.120]  its way. Okay, Steve, give people the number, give them the website. It's
[2:17:48.120 --> 2:17:56.680]  800-409-5633, 800-409-5633 for those of you that are not computer
[2:17:56.680 --> 2:18:02.520]  conscious, for those of you who can get on a stinking computer, get on eFoodsDirect.com
[2:18:02.520 --> 2:18:08.440]  eFoodsDirect.com, if you have any difficulties, give us a call at the
[2:18:08.440 --> 2:18:13.200]  800 number, we'll follow you back, but they get it done and get it done now. By
[2:18:13.200 --> 2:18:19.960]  the way, the stock market is plunging right now. Absolutely. It has plunged
[2:18:19.960 --> 2:18:24.400]  80-something points just in the last 30 minutes, less than 30 minutes, almost 30
[2:18:24.400 --> 2:18:30.560]  since they did this. It's going straight down right now and it'll go up
[2:18:30.560 --> 2:18:35.000]  and down before. This means total inflation and again, it's more like
[2:18:35.000 --> 2:18:38.600]  99% of the phone calls they got in emails. I've had Congress people on, it's been
[2:18:38.600 --> 2:18:42.760]  in the news. I mean, people have talked about 9,000 phone calls a day and five
[2:18:42.760 --> 2:18:46.880]  of them are for it. Another congressman on the show said 2,000 plus phone calls
[2:18:46.880 --> 2:18:51.400]  and six calls were for it. I mean, they just don't care because they were
[2:18:51.400 --> 2:18:56.680]  told martial law. Steve, go up to infowars.com. As you know, this isn't the
[2:18:56.680 --> 2:18:59.160]  one earlier on Monday, the congressman that was threatened martial law in the
[2:18:59.160 --> 2:19:03.360]  house. They threatened nationwide martial law and basically removing the
[2:19:03.360 --> 2:19:07.540]  congress, total dictatorship. Well, that is a dictatorship that does that, so they
[2:19:07.540 --> 2:19:12.960]  gave in and this is martial law. Get on the number again, Steve.
[2:19:12.960 --> 2:19:20.520]  800-409-5633 and on the web, eFoodsDirect.com. Alex, I appreciate you. We got it going.
[2:19:20.520 --> 2:19:24.800]  Big banners at the top of infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. If you forget the
[2:19:24.800 --> 2:19:27.600]  address, eFoodsDirect.com. The number, one more time, Steve.
[2:19:27.600 --> 2:19:32.960]  800-409-5633. We're going to come back with a lot more news and information and
[2:19:32.960 --> 2:19:37.400]  several congressmen lined up. Stay with us. Transmission straight ahead.
[2:19:37.400 --> 2:19:42.200]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining
[2:19:42.200 --> 2:19:46.240]  high energy and vibrant health? Most experts agree that the water you drink
[2:19:46.240 --> 2:19:51.880]  should be at a pH level of 9 or higher. Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula
[2:19:51.880 --> 2:19:55.960]  of the most alkaline minerals and elements. This product is a one-of-a-kind
[2:19:55.960 --> 2:20:01.040]  in its strength and effectiveness. Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways
[2:20:01.040 --> 2:20:05.200]  to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining
[2:20:05.200 --> 2:20:09.640]  your health and energy. With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the
[2:20:09.640 --> 2:20:14.480]  water you drink up to the pH of 10. Alkalizing water helps the body rid
[2:20:14.480 --> 2:20:18.880]  itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body. Disease
[2:20:18.880 --> 2:20:23.600]  organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.

[2:20:37.120 --> 2:20:42.640]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of
[2:20:42.640 --> 2:20:48.080]  war against this country. The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the
[2:20:48.080 --> 2:20:52.840]  enemy? Bin Laden. This is his M.O. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to the
[2:20:52.840 --> 2:20:58.240]  Osama Bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to
[2:20:58.240 --> 2:21:02.640]  intelligence networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe
[2:21:02.640 --> 2:21:08.120]  that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm
[2:21:08.120 --> 2:21:12.880]  aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained. In Laden's connections to
[2:21:12.880 --> 2:21:17.640]  the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli
[2:21:17.640 --> 2:21:21.200]  intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[2:21:21.200 --> 2:21:26.760]  much more. Fabled Enemies, get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high
[2:21:26.760 --> 2:21:30.840]  quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:21:30.840 --> 2:21:37.840]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[2:21:37.840 --> 2:21:42.760]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water. And did you know that you have
[2:21:42.760 --> 2:21:46.840]  greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[2:21:46.840 --> 2:21:50.680]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are
[2:21:50.680 --> 2:21:55.440]  absorbed into the skin. The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and
[2:21:55.440 --> 2:21:59.920]  cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it
[2:21:59.920 --> 2:22:05.040]  inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus. The KDF dual media
[2:22:05.040 --> 2:22:08.960]  shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes
[2:22:08.960 --> 2:22:12.920]  first. Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to
[2:22:12.920 --> 2:22:17.680]  reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria. What about you? Order your KDF
[2:22:17.680 --> 2:22:22.880]  shower filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[2:22:36.320 --> 2:22:41.860]  Lead from solder and copper pipes, mercury from fish, dental fillings, vaccines,
[2:22:41.860 --> 2:22:46.640]  arsenic in the water. These heavy metal toxins are difficult or even impossible to
[2:22:46.640 --> 2:22:50.920]  avoid. Even trace amounts of these heavy metals over time can impact your health.
[2:22:50.920 --> 2:22:54.280]  Many health problems have been suggested as being related to this heavy metal
[2:22:54.280 --> 2:22:58.200]  exposure, including memory loss, high blood pressure, depression, mood swings,
[2:22:58.200 --> 2:23:02.480]  speech disorders, neuropathy, autoimmune diseases, chronic fatigue, and more.
[2:23:02.480 --> 2:23:06.360]  Unfortunately, traditional detoxifying isn't able to clear the body of these
[2:23:06.360 --> 2:23:10.960]  harmful and potentially deadly toxins. That's why there's PuraClear from Ripple
[2:23:10.960 --> 2:23:14.720]  Creek. PuraClear contains a proprietary blend of ingredients including a
[2:23:14.720 --> 2:23:18.920]  cilantro extract and alphalipoic acid, among other ingredients formulated
[2:23:18.920 --> 2:23:23.200]  specifically to promote body cleansing. PuraClear also has ingredients selected
[2:23:23.200 --> 2:23:27.040]  to promote improved circulation to enhance activity so that heavy metals may
[2:23:27.040 --> 2:23:31.200]  be more effectively captured and removed from the body. Order PuraClear now by

[2:23:54.120 --> 2:23:59.720]  Congressman Dan Hanberg popping in at g-minus eight minutes. Congressman Brad
[2:23:59.720 --> 2:24:08.320]  Sherman coming up in 45 minutes. Ron Paul, very close to getting him.
[2:24:08.320 --> 2:24:15.960]  Comment on House approves bailout for financial markets. The House approves a
[2:24:15.960 --> 2:24:20.200]  revised 700 billion financial rescue package, really 800-something billion, ending a
[2:24:20.200 --> 2:24:23.080]  week-long battle over controversial measure after lawmakers came into
[2:24:23.080 --> 2:24:26.840]  pressure to head off a growing financial crisis. You just heard the former head of
[2:24:26.840 --> 2:24:30.320]  the Treasury, former head of policy tell you it's a complete fraud will not help
[2:24:30.320 --> 2:24:34.360]  the economy, it's for the elite, not for the people we are in deep trouble. The plan
[2:24:34.360 --> 2:24:37.480]  which was already approved by the Senate would allow the government to spend
[2:24:37.480 --> 2:24:41.000]  billions of dollars to buy bad mortgage-related securities and other
[2:24:41.000 --> 2:24:45.000]  devalued assets from troubled financial institutions. If it works, advocates say
[2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:48.680]  that would allow frozen credit to begin flilling again and prevent a serious
[2:24:48.680 --> 2:24:56.720]  recession. But let's give you the facts now. It does nothing to help the people
[2:24:56.720 --> 2:25:02.480]  it will devalue the dollar faster, it will devalue the US international
[2:25:02.480 --> 2:25:09.960]  rating from AAA down to junk probably, and martial law was threatened. If you
[2:25:09.960 --> 2:25:14.560]  tuned in earlier in the week and heard Congressman Dan on or you heard
[2:25:14.560 --> 2:25:21.680]  Congressman Burgesson, they were discussing how they were threatened with
[2:25:21.680 --> 2:25:25.560]  martial law in the House, basically weren't allowed into meetings, police
[2:25:25.560 --> 2:25:30.200]  state actions. Now congressmen are being threatened with open physical
[2:25:30.200 --> 2:25:38.400]  martial law. They were threatened with physical martial law just as the
[2:25:38.400 --> 2:25:41.400]  Federal Reserve, the Treasury and others have been saying they could act outside
[2:25:41.400 --> 2:25:46.680]  Congress. That is martial law. Now they've been given financial immunity from
[2:25:46.680 --> 2:25:50.280]  their crimes, the power to buy, sell anything they want, to basically take
[2:25:50.280 --> 2:25:53.240]  over more of the economy and and funnel the imploding economy through
[2:25:53.240 --> 2:26:00.280]  themselves in an IMF World Bank receivership move. Play Congressman
[2:26:00.280 --> 2:26:06.480]  Shepard, this is Congressman Shepard on C-SPAN, ladies and gentlemen, in the last
[2:26:06.480 --> 2:26:11.720]  24 hours. Here it is. The only way they can pass this bill is by creating and
[2:26:11.720 --> 2:26:18.280]  sustaining a panic atmosphere. That atmosphere is not justified. Many of us
[2:26:18.280 --> 2:26:23.720]  were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday
[2:26:23.720 --> 2:26:29.080]  that the sky would fall, the market would drop two or three thousand points the
[2:26:29.080 --> 2:26:33.120]  first day, another couple thousand the second day, and a few members were even
[2:26:33.120 --> 2:26:39.280]  told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no. That's what I
[2:26:39.280 --> 2:26:45.640]  call fear-mongering, unjustified, proven wrong. We've got a week, we've got two
[2:26:45.640 --> 2:26:50.600]  weeks to write a good bill. The only way to write to pass a bad bill, keep the
[2:26:50.600 --> 2:26:57.160]  panic pressure on. Now what has the Senate done to this bill? And ladies and
[2:26:57.160 --> 2:27:02.200]  gentlemen, they couldn't remove the pork, but forget the tens of billions. Well,
[2:27:02.200 --> 2:27:05.520]  it's a hundred and fifty billion dollars in pork stacked on the seventy
[2:27:05.520 --> 2:27:10.000]  billion, seven hundred billion. Now with the old seven hundred billion dollar bill,
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:14.280]  Bloomberg and others said it was really five trillion. So they went from seven
[2:27:14.280 --> 2:27:18.480]  hundred billion that was really five trillion to eight hundred and fifty
[2:27:18.480 --> 2:27:26.280]  something billion. I guess that makes it more like six and a half trillion. A six
[2:27:26.280 --> 2:27:31.000]  and a half trillion dollar transfer from the real economy into the very blood
[2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:34.720]  sucking Rothschild Rockefeller banks that have engineered all this and have
[2:27:34.720 --> 2:27:37.840]  sucked all these third world countries dry and are now doing it to us and it's
[2:27:37.840 --> 2:27:42.360]  going to devalue your currency. It is going to destroy the stock market. You
[2:27:42.360 --> 2:27:45.800]  watch it happen and as it gets worse, they'll say, oh, it's getting worse. Give
[2:27:45.800 --> 2:27:49.360]  us more money. Give us more power. We'll fix it. Then they get it. Oh, we give us
[2:27:49.360 --> 2:27:52.280]  more money, more power. They don't even need that now. They have been given
[2:27:52.280 --> 2:27:57.240]  martial law powers economically. The Congress mindlessly signed it away and
[2:27:57.240 --> 2:28:01.520]  now under PD 51 Bush and others or Barack Obama or McCain or whoever comes
[2:28:01.520 --> 2:28:08.320]  into office can say or do whatever they want. They're total puppets. This is so
[2:28:08.320 --> 2:28:15.520]  massive. This is financial martial law in the words of Dr. Paul Gregg Roberts
[2:28:15.520 --> 2:28:19.160]  earlier concurring with me saying, yes, this is the equivalent of martial law. So
[2:28:19.160 --> 2:28:23.920]  they said, we'll declare martial law on you if you don't do this and in the bill
[2:28:23.920 --> 2:28:27.960]  is martial law financially which runs and controls everything. I heard Robert
[2:28:27.960 --> 2:28:32.760]  say that's everything anyways and the same week they activate a brigade and
[2:28:32.760 --> 2:28:35.800]  they said they're going to rotate in more brigades for North Com for domestic
[2:28:35.800 --> 2:28:39.880]  operations for quote, civil unrest, microwave guns and they say, we hope we
[2:28:39.880 --> 2:28:44.520]  don't have to shoot Americans with bullets. Can you put two and two together?
[2:28:47.640 --> 2:28:52.640]  I mean, this is just absolutely amazing. Like Ron Paul said a few months ago on
[2:28:52.640 --> 2:28:56.200]  the show, he said something big's coming, a total worldwide meltdown. He's been
[2:28:56.200 --> 2:29:03.000]  saying it for 30 years and then he said it's here. And the very bastards that
[2:29:03.000 --> 2:29:07.400]  orchestrated it all now get even more power and it didn't matter if 90 plus
[2:29:07.400 --> 2:29:11.840]  percent of the phone calls and emails said no, no, no, no, no, no, no, thousands of
[2:29:11.840 --> 2:29:20.240]  calls to one. They don't care. They say we are doing what we want. This is a
[2:29:20.240 --> 2:29:24.440]  government that slots anthrax attacks, 9-11, illegal wars, they're a pack of
[2:29:24.440 --> 2:29:30.560]  criminals and you're seeing it right now. We're on the march, the Empire's on the
[2:29:30.560 --> 2:29:34.760]  run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:29:37.960 --> 2:29:43.640]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information, 9-11
[2:29:43.640 --> 2:29:47.200]  was an inside job. Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet
[2:29:47.200 --> 2:29:50.600]  from the New World Order? How do the American people know that 9-11 was a
[2:29:50.600 --> 2:29:54.560]  stage, was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the fallout or commission to
[2:29:54.560 --> 2:30:01.080]  see far? The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed
[2:30:01.080 --> 2:30:06.240]  the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door. Seven years after the attacks of
[2:30:06.240 --> 2:30:14.240]  September 11th, a global awakening has taken place. An inside job. How dare you?
[2:30:14.240 --> 2:30:19.760]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for
[2:30:19.760 --> 2:30:29.040]  treason yourself. All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue. If the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.

[2:33:48.040 --> 2:33:52.640]  horn, I'm letting people realize with just this one radio show and others out
[2:33:52.640 --> 2:33:56.920]  there and other websites and other great people, we are carrying the message of
[2:33:56.920 --> 2:34:01.680]  truth of the people and they're listening like never before. Ron Paul
[2:34:01.680 --> 2:34:05.880]  coming up sometime in the next hour and a half for a quick interview. We have
[2:34:05.880 --> 2:34:10.280]  Congressman Brad Sherman who was told this has to be passed or martial law,
[2:34:10.280 --> 2:34:14.200]  not martial law with the House rules like we heard from Congressman from
[2:34:14.200 --> 2:34:19.160]  North Texas, Burgess on Monday, national martial law, Northcom announcing they
[2:34:19.160 --> 2:34:23.160]  are going to use trips domestically activated brigades, not just one but
[2:34:23.160 --> 2:34:29.520]  multiple brigades for continuity of government for civil unrest. This is the
[2:34:29.520 --> 2:34:32.120]  takeover, you're seeing what happened in Nazi Germany, you're seeing what
[2:34:32.120 --> 2:34:35.560]  happened in Russia, you're seeing what happened with Pol Pot, I mean this is it.
[2:34:35.560 --> 2:34:39.280]  We have to get the word out, we have to say no, we have to stop them, they
[2:34:39.280 --> 2:34:45.840]  engineered all this and a man who valiantly exposed this over a year ago
[2:34:45.840 --> 2:34:52.360]  is Congressman Dan Hembert from Northern California, federal congressman in
[2:34:52.360 --> 2:34:58.920]  several terms, now out of the Congress and he wrote a detailed report that we
[2:34:58.920 --> 2:35:03.400]  have a link to in the story that Kurt Nemo wrote about this on infowars.com,
[2:35:03.400 --> 2:35:07.640]  read it carefully. This was in the San Francisco Chronicle picked up by other
[2:35:07.640 --> 2:35:13.120]  newspapers across the world because he's highly respected and he started out with
[2:35:13.120 --> 2:35:18.920]  this quote, rule by fear or rule by law, the power of the executive to cast a man
[2:35:18.920 --> 2:35:23.160]  to prison without formulating any charge known to law and particularly to deny
[2:35:23.160 --> 2:35:27.280]  him the judgment of his peers is the highest degree of odious and is the
[2:35:27.280 --> 2:35:30.360]  foundation of all the totalitarian governments whether Nazi or communist
[2:35:30.360 --> 2:35:36.760]  Winston Churchill, remember 21st, 1943 and then he goes through the
[2:35:36.760 --> 2:35:43.080]  systematic takeover, PDD 51, John Warren Defense Authorization Act, the Military
[2:35:43.080 --> 2:35:46.960]  Commissions Act and then you've got all these covert operations with military
[2:35:46.960 --> 2:35:50.000]  buying off mayors and police chiefs that we've interviewed and brought on air
[2:35:50.000 --> 2:35:54.760]  about Delta Force and CIA showing up with bags of money saying just be friends
[2:35:54.760 --> 2:35:59.400]  with us with what's coming, Governor Ventura, first day, this is years ago as a
[2:35:59.400 --> 2:36:03.960]  governor's called down into the basement 23 CIA agents not telling them who their
[2:36:03.960 --> 2:36:09.800]  names are, black ops are all around us folks, this is the military industrial
[2:36:09.800 --> 2:36:12.960]  complex just like in third world countries, the junta's where the military
[2:36:12.960 --> 2:36:17.680]  takes over or Roman Caesar's being overthrown on a monthly basis in the deep
[2:36:17.680 --> 2:36:22.880]  decline before the second 410 by Alaric, you know overthrows every month by the
[2:36:22.880 --> 2:36:29.200]  generals, I mean this is what Caesar did 2040 something years ago when he passed
[2:36:29.200 --> 2:36:34.000]  the Rubicon and brought his troops into Rome, of course that river in the north
[2:36:34.000 --> 2:36:37.960]  up by Austria, that's what it means to cross the Rubicon, so I'll give you some
[2:36:37.960 --> 2:36:42.560]  background here, this is really happening and it's being done not in slow
[2:36:42.560 --> 2:36:47.240]  motion but in medium motion, we can't accept it, we can't go along with it, to
[2:36:47.240 --> 2:36:56.480]  recap 35 minutes ago, no exactly 37 minutes ago, the house passed under threat
[2:36:56.480 --> 2:37:00.880]  of economic terrorism with the plunge protection team didn't bail out the
[2:37:00.880 --> 2:37:05.480]  stock market as they do daily and so it plunged 1 trillion 200 billion plus in
[2:37:05.480 --> 2:37:08.840]  one day on Monday, that terrorizing didn't work, still 90 plus percent against the
[2:37:08.840 --> 2:37:14.000]  banker empowerment bill, the economic takeover bill, we're going to the
[2:37:14.000 --> 2:37:17.320]  congressman here in just a moment, I want to recap all this, this is historic, I
[2:37:17.320 --> 2:37:20.640]  want to get his take on it and how we stop it and turn it around and then they
[2:37:20.640 --> 2:37:24.760]  told Congress they said you passed this or physical martial law will come, they
[2:37:24.760 --> 2:37:29.280]  were told this last night and today and the house passed it under duress, this
[2:37:29.280 --> 2:37:33.600]  ties into everything we've seen, the clearly launched White House anthrax
[2:37:33.600 --> 2:37:37.160]  attacks on Congress, folks my life's in danger, I'm getting death threats every
[2:37:37.160 --> 2:37:41.200]  day now, other people are, this is happening, you understand, this is red
[2:37:41.200 --> 2:37:46.920]  level, America is being taken over, we've got to say no now, the good news is 90
[2:37:46.920 --> 2:37:49.800]  plus percent are against it and are hopping mad now, so this government's
[2:37:49.800 --> 2:37:54.160]  totally illegitimate, this vote is illegitimate and this is just so amazing
[2:37:54.160 --> 2:37:58.280]  and now they got martial law economic powers, it's right there in the bill in
[2:37:58.280 --> 2:38:01.400]  the subsections for the private bankers, this only protects them, not the people,
[2:38:01.400 --> 2:38:07.240]  Congressman Dan Hamburg, who warned us again in February of last year, more than
[2:38:07.240 --> 2:38:12.280]  a year ago, rule by fear, rule by law, it's happening, sir, it could get a lot
[2:38:12.280 --> 2:38:18.160]  worse, break down what it's like to see this happening and go through the points.
[2:38:18.160 --> 2:38:24.320]  Well, you know, this is not something that really should surprise people, but I think
[2:38:24.320 --> 2:38:29.440]  the hardening thing is that the calls that were going into congressional
[2:38:29.440 --> 2:38:34.840]  offices were, you know, anywhere from 50 to 100 to 1 against this, so I
[2:38:34.840 --> 2:38:40.160]  think it's clear that people are finally waking up to the loss of the
[2:38:40.160 --> 2:38:46.040]  Constitution, the loss of sovereignty and also the way this government has set
[2:38:46.040 --> 2:38:53.320]  things up in the way they have in order to systematically tank the
[2:38:53.320 --> 2:38:58.400]  economy. Now, the thing that I'm looking at now, we've got 30 days
[2:38:58.400 --> 2:39:05.680]  until a presidential election, what will happen in those 30 days and is the
[2:39:05.680 --> 2:39:12.680]  current cabal that's in charge, you know, is the neocon cabal, willing to take the
[2:39:12.680 --> 2:39:17.800]  risk of turning this over, you know, to the Democratic Party. I mean, we know the
[2:39:17.800 --> 2:39:22.440]  Democratic Party is not significantly different from the Republicans, but
[2:39:22.440 --> 2:39:29.120]  still I have to wonder if there is another surprise in store for us in the
[2:39:29.120 --> 2:39:34.880]  month of October besides this. It's not clear at all that the markets are going
[2:39:34.880 --> 2:39:40.000]  to be responsive to this because the underlying economy is what is, you
[2:39:40.000 --> 2:39:44.360]  know, what is messed up in this country, you know, it's the foreclosures, it's the
[2:39:44.360 --> 2:39:49.160]  loss of employment, it's the fact that the infrastructure of the country is
[2:39:49.160 --> 2:39:52.320]  crumbling, the educational system is crumbling, the healthcare system is
[2:39:52.320 --> 2:39:59.720]  crumbling. So whether this bailout, it's certainly gonna be good for investment
[2:39:59.720 --> 2:40:05.080]  bankers and for the confidence on Wall Street in the short term, but I'm not at
[2:40:05.080 --> 2:40:11.160]  all sure that we're gonna see that we're not gonna see another big surprise in
[2:40:11.160 --> 2:40:17.320]  the next month. And one of those possible surprises, I think, is, you know, kind of
[2:40:17.320 --> 2:40:24.640]  a Hail Mary, Hail Mary Pass kind of thing from Cheney and his group inside
[2:40:24.640 --> 2:40:29.600]  the administration. I think back to what happened with the missing
[2:40:29.600 --> 2:40:35.280]  nukes from the Air Force Base in North Dakota. I think to the assassination in
[2:40:35.280 --> 2:40:41.280]  Houston a couple months ago of a top CIA operative, Roland Carnegie, who was
[2:40:41.280 --> 2:40:47.280]  trying to stop the possible fell flag attack on the port of Houston. And I
[2:40:47.280 --> 2:40:54.440]  just, you know, I think now that the American people are pretty much
[2:40:54.440 --> 2:40:59.880]  uncertain of everything that's going on, and you know, I think about Naomi
[2:40:59.880 --> 2:41:06.200]  Klein and her shock doctrine theory. I think people are in shock right now and
[2:41:06.200 --> 2:41:13.480]  that this is the time that people like Cheney most take advantage of that shock
[2:41:13.480 --> 2:41:18.960]  to manipulate public opinion and to do what they want to do and to pursue their
[2:41:18.960 --> 2:41:24.680]  globalist, you know, agenda, which is way beyond anything that the American
[2:41:24.680 --> 2:41:30.560]  people would normally tolerate. Absolutely. We're seeing things happen on
[2:41:30.560 --> 2:41:35.160]  daily basis that would have shaken the political system to its core just a
[2:41:35.160 --> 2:41:40.920]  decade ago. I mean, from torturing children from their parents to domestic
[2:41:40.920 --> 2:41:44.280]  spying on the American people to the military spying on peace groups to
[2:41:44.280 --> 2:41:48.960]  FEMA camps to being built openly and being in the newspaper to just
[2:41:48.960 --> 2:41:54.520]  absolute crazy corruption. But the good news is it did come out with Cy
[2:41:54.520 --> 2:41:59.600]  Hirsch. It did come out on MSNBC that Cheney just three months ago was
[2:41:59.600 --> 2:42:03.560]  planning to paint up US Navy patrol boats like Iranian boats and have Navy
[2:42:03.560 --> 2:42:09.440]  Seals launch sneak attacks on larger US ships in the Strait of Hormuz. They're
[2:42:09.440 --> 2:42:13.440]  in the Persian Gulf between Iran and Iraq. I mean, people, you know, by
[2:42:13.440 --> 2:42:18.680]  exposing 9-11, 9-11 truth then shifted people into the paradigm of really
[2:42:18.680 --> 2:42:23.360]  seeing false flag terrorism. And this is no doubt. I want your take on this. And
[2:42:23.360 --> 2:42:27.200]  also understanding Alex that false flag terrorism is nothing new. I mean,
[2:42:27.200 --> 2:42:31.200]  suddenly people are looking back to the Gulf of Tonkin resolution and they're
[2:42:31.200 --> 2:42:37.000]  looking back to, you know, Ajax Liberty and the assassination and, you know,
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:40.680]  things start to fall into place and it's like the scales begin to fall from the
[2:42:40.680 --> 2:42:44.680]  eyes and people go, uh-huh, this is the kind of country I've been living in all
[2:42:44.680 --> 2:42:50.240]  these years. And what has this propaganda that's been put out by the
[2:42:50.240 --> 2:42:56.120]  elites been all about? And, you know, that is a very encouraging thing. But one
[2:42:56.120 --> 2:42:59.840]  of the problems, and we know it's one of the big problems, and programs like
[2:42:59.840 --> 2:43:05.080]  yours battle against that problem, which is that people still mostly get
[2:43:05.080 --> 2:43:09.520]  garbage information from the mainstream media. And the core of that gets sucked
[2:43:09.520 --> 2:43:15.760]  into corporate control. And, you know, what is so vital is getting information to
[2:43:15.760 --> 2:43:19.480]  people because the more people that understand what's going on, the more
[2:43:19.480 --> 2:43:24.280]  people there are who are going to stand up and say, no way, not in my name, will
[2:43:24.280 --> 2:43:28.680]  you commit these corrupt and heinous acts? Well, I want your take on two
[2:43:28.680 --> 2:43:33.360]  things. A, is this not incredibly revealing and a huge wake-up call? That's
[2:43:33.360 --> 2:43:38.120]  what we're seeing. If people are already waking up and already angry, they are
[2:43:38.120 --> 2:43:43.760]  really waking up now and are really upset to the fact that on average 95%
[2:43:43.760 --> 2:43:47.440]  according to the polls, congressmen and women have said they'll get 2,000, 3,000,
[2:43:47.440 --> 2:43:55.000]  9,000 in one senator from California saying no to the bailout and it still
[2:43:55.000 --> 2:43:59.200]  happens. That's revealing that this establishment doesn't care what the
[2:43:59.200 --> 2:44:02.400]  people want or what the people say or even what is constitutional. And
[2:44:02.400 --> 2:44:06.800]  secondarily, I want your comment on that secondarily, we have open economic
[2:44:06.800 --> 2:44:11.280]  terrorism with since when did presidents and secretaries of treasury and
[2:44:11.280 --> 2:44:16.440]  democratic leaders scream, you better give us this power under the bailout or
[2:44:16.440 --> 2:44:22.280]  there'll be a depression. That is pure economic terrorism. Yeah, but you know,
[2:44:22.280 --> 2:44:26.080]  we're getting used to that because that's the kind of thing that they did to
[2:44:26.080 --> 2:44:31.680]  to get us into the Iraq war. And that's the kind of thing they do to, you know,
[2:44:31.680 --> 2:44:36.680]  when Katrina's hit by a hurricane, you know, what they do is to keep us
[2:44:36.680 --> 2:44:43.600]  in a state of shock and confusion. And I'm really disappointed actually this
[2:44:43.600 --> 2:44:49.440]  morning to see 271 votes in favor of this bailout in spite of the fact,
[2:44:49.440 --> 2:44:54.520]  as you said, that there was, you know, just overwhelming opposition to it on the
[2:44:54.520 --> 2:44:59.760]  part of the constituents. And what it means is that the electoral system is
[2:44:59.760 --> 2:45:06.720]  now so compromised that many of, you know, many of these members who went ahead
[2:45:06.720 --> 2:45:09.920]  and voted for this, in spite of the fact that their constituents were dead
[2:45:09.920 --> 2:45:15.000]  against it, are in districts that are considered safe enough for them to make
[2:45:15.000 --> 2:45:18.880]  these kind of votes without suffering repercussion at the polls. I mean, I
[2:45:18.880 --> 2:45:22.920]  think what we'll see is that a lot of people aren't going to turn out
[2:45:22.920 --> 2:45:26.400]  and vote because they're going to go, you know, this government is too
[2:45:26.400 --> 2:45:30.920]  corrupt. And they're, you know, they'll just say, well, I just won't vote this
[2:45:30.920 --> 2:45:36.320]  year for a member of Congress who would betray me in this sense. But I don't
[2:45:36.320 --> 2:45:41.760]  see where it's going to mean a substantial shift in governance in the
[2:45:41.760 --> 2:45:45.480]  country. I mean, I don't think the next Congress is going to be significantly
[2:45:45.480 --> 2:45:50.520]  different than this one, you know, because of this particular vote or
[2:45:50.520 --> 2:45:54.920]  because of a series of bad votes which have happened over the past several
[2:45:54.920 --> 2:46:02.200]  years. Congressman, I want to, I want to finish playing this clip. You haven't
[2:46:02.200 --> 2:46:05.960]  had a chance to hear it, and then I'll let you finish what you were saying.
[2:46:05.960 --> 2:46:12.000]  This is the Congressman, and this was, and he's coming up, Congressman Brad
[2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:16.440]  Sherman, next hour. This is what he said other members of Congress were told,
[2:46:16.440 --> 2:46:22.120]  physical martial law in America if they didn't pass this. Okay, this is
[2:46:22.120 --> 2:46:28.360]  official. Here it is. The only way they can pass this bill is by creating and
[2:46:28.360 --> 2:46:34.920]  sustaining a panic atmosphere. That atmosphere is not justified. Many of us
[2:46:34.920 --> 2:46:40.360]  were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday
[2:46:40.360 --> 2:46:45.720]  that the sky would fall, the market would drop two or three thousand points the
[2:46:45.720 --> 2:46:49.760]  first day, another couple thousand the second day, and a few members were even
[2:46:49.760 --> 2:46:55.920]  told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no. That's what I
[2:46:55.920 --> 2:47:02.280]  call fear-mongering, unjustified, proven wrong. We've got a week, we've got two
[2:47:02.280 --> 2:47:07.200]  weeks to write a good bill. The only way to write to pass a bad bill, keep the
[2:47:07.200 --> 2:47:11.040]  panic pressure on. Now what has the Senate done to this bill?
[2:47:11.040 --> 2:47:15.680]  Congressman Dan Hamburg, your comments on that. You know, I'm afraid that the
[2:47:15.680 --> 2:47:20.480]  majority, the great majority of people, not only citizens of this country but
[2:47:20.480 --> 2:47:25.400]  members of the US Congress, were not aware that on August 28th, just about six
[2:47:25.400 --> 2:47:31.760]  weeks ago, Bush extended for the seventh time the national state of
[2:47:31.760 --> 2:47:36.800]  emergency under which this country has been de facto governed ever since
[2:47:36.800 --> 2:47:40.760]  September 11th or September 14th, depending on which document you look at,
[2:47:40.760 --> 2:47:47.560]  of 2001. Bush has extended that state of national emergency under which he
[2:47:47.560 --> 2:47:53.040]  implements documents like the National Emergency Act, but more importantly,
[2:47:53.040 --> 2:47:59.400]  Homeland Security, Presidential Directive 20, National Security Directive,
[2:47:59.400 --> 2:48:07.800]  Presidential Directive 51, under which economic problems are one of the
[2:48:07.800 --> 2:48:13.800]  reasons for the declaration of martial law. So these measures are
[2:48:13.800 --> 2:48:18.320]  actually in effect and have been in effect for seven or eight years. So
[2:48:18.320 --> 2:48:23.440]  people should not look at this and say, oh, martial law, no way. We have
[2:48:23.440 --> 2:48:30.520]  been in that state ever since the attacks of 9-11, and that is why there
[2:48:30.520 --> 2:48:33.800]  is nothing more important to the consciousness of the people of this
[2:48:33.800 --> 2:48:38.880]  country than the 9-11 truth movement and getting to the bottom of what has
[2:48:38.880 --> 2:48:45.240]  instigated this eight-year reign of terror. And Congressman Hamburg, again,
[2:48:45.240 --> 2:48:49.160]  going back to economic terrorism, they need this implosion now to get the
[2:48:49.160 --> 2:48:54.520]  powers they need. Just as PDD 51 says, it's clear. They start fear-mongering two
[2:48:54.520 --> 2:48:57.800]  weeks ago saying, depression, depression, it drives down the market, and then
[2:48:57.800 --> 2:49:01.480]  they're given the power. I mean, it's transparent. They did this in front of
[2:49:01.480 --> 2:49:07.600]  everyone. This is incredibly criminal. This is an incredibly criminal act that
[2:49:07.600 --> 2:49:10.960]  they're doing, and this shows me they're going for broke. I think this is just the
[2:49:10.960 --> 2:49:15.240]  start. And I think one way to look at it is, this is kind of an economic 9-11,
[2:49:15.240 --> 2:49:20.840]  and I think they are going for broke in terms of destroying the American
[2:49:20.840 --> 2:49:26.000]  economy so that they can come back with a whole new globalist approach and sell
[2:49:26.000 --> 2:49:30.480]  that to a desperate people. We'll start seeing things like the North American
[2:49:30.480 --> 2:49:34.800]  Union. They've already said that. They've already kissed a jerk. The Amero, you know,
[2:49:34.800 --> 2:49:39.840]  replacing the dollar, national sovereignty, and the trash can, and these are things
[2:49:39.840 --> 2:49:45.440]  that normally people would not tolerate, but their idea is to get people in such
[2:49:45.440 --> 2:49:50.760]  a panic that they will look for the savior. You know, this is what we'll
[2:49:50.760 --> 2:49:55.160]  find our republic-type stuff that we're going back to in the United States of
[2:49:55.160 --> 2:49:58.520]  America. Unbelievable. You're absolutely right. Stay there. So we're gonna break.
[2:49:58.520 --> 2:50:03.960]  We have Congressman Dan Hamburg on with us. More congressmen coming up, sitting
[2:50:03.960 --> 2:50:08.560]  congressmen. Ladies and gentlemen, this is happening. Remember, almost three years
[2:50:08.560 --> 2:50:12.120]  ago, we snuck in the Bilderberg group. We got the information out. We said they're
[2:50:12.120 --> 2:50:17.600]  gonna start the implosion by restricting credit on the subprime mortgages. They
[2:50:17.600 --> 2:50:22.600]  are gonna engineer this. We're on record, okay? And now how did it happen? Because
[2:50:22.600 --> 2:50:25.840]  they run things. They are orchestrating all of this. In fact, we're gonna skip this
[2:50:25.840 --> 2:50:31.480]  break for the prisonplanet.tv viewers. Congressman, I'm gonna skip this break.
[2:50:31.480 --> 2:50:34.400]  We don't waste any time. This is too important. So we're only here for the
[2:50:34.400 --> 2:50:41.840]  internet streams and the TV viewers. But we also have a big story about a known
[2:50:41.840 --> 2:50:46.320]  government asset putting out a hoax that all the banks were gonna close next
[2:50:46.320 --> 2:50:50.040]  week. I want to get your take on that later. But other points you want to make
[2:50:50.040 --> 2:50:56.160]  right now, sir, about ways to counter this and where you see this going. Well, I think
[2:50:56.160 --> 2:51:00.600]  the best way to counter this, as I said before, is information. And I think that
[2:51:00.600 --> 2:51:04.080]  the place we're really gonna get into trouble, and I think they've already
[2:51:04.080 --> 2:51:09.560]  prepared themselves for this, is shutting down of the internet. And
[2:51:09.560 --> 2:51:18.040]  Stanford professor recently said that this is in the works. And there is a
[2:51:18.040 --> 2:51:23.880]  plan for a so-called E-terror attack, which will necessitate the government
[2:51:23.880 --> 2:51:28.560]  taking much stricter control over the internet. So that's something that's
[2:51:28.560 --> 2:51:33.160]  right. He openly talked about it. The internet, too, that they're setting it
[2:51:33.160 --> 2:51:38.840]  all up. Regulations, taxation. YouTube and Google have now accepted
[2:51:38.840 --> 2:51:42.680]  Senator Lieberman's deal that whatever the government says take off, they take
[2:51:42.680 --> 2:51:47.280]  off. I mean, it's already happening. Well, yeah, and it's much like the
[2:51:47.280 --> 2:51:51.520]  Patriot Act, which was all written and ready to go when 9-11 happened. Strangely
[2:51:51.520 --> 2:51:56.440]  enough, they had this thousand-plus-page bill already written when 9-11
[2:51:56.440 --> 2:52:00.760]  happened. And I think that is a tremendous threat, because I think the
[2:52:00.760 --> 2:52:06.280]  internet is an incredible organizing tool right now that those of us who
[2:52:06.280 --> 2:52:13.080]  are totally against what we see our government doing, I think this is
[2:52:13.080 --> 2:52:17.680]  the way we do pull ourselves together and communicate with each other. And even
[2:52:17.680 --> 2:52:23.320]  to the extent of, you know, the protests that went on around the country
[2:52:23.320 --> 2:52:28.640]  against this bailout bill were organized by, you know, one guy in New York City who
[2:52:28.640 --> 2:52:32.640]  put out an email to a bunch of his friends, and the thing, you know, just
[2:52:32.640 --> 2:52:37.280]  mushroomed. And that's the way I see people taking to the streets in this
[2:52:37.280 --> 2:52:42.640]  country is communicating with each other through the internet and setting up, you
[2:52:42.640 --> 2:52:48.720]  know, mass protests and mass actions, which, you know, will they work? I don't
[2:52:48.720 --> 2:52:53.760]  know. But I do think people are getting to the point where, you know, they're just
[2:52:53.760 --> 2:52:58.280]  not going to sit back in their homes and wait to be foreclosed on.
[2:52:58.280 --> 2:53:01.240]  They're not going to just keep going to their jobs and waiting for that pink
[2:53:01.240 --> 2:53:06.120]  flip to come. They're not going to just keep going to the mall and, you know,
[2:53:06.120 --> 2:53:10.960]  spending more money to, you know, to try to shore up the economy of the country,
[2:53:10.960 --> 2:53:15.560]  because they just don't have the money to spend any longer. So I, you know, I
[2:53:15.560 --> 2:53:21.160]  think things are spiraling, and I think things are happening very fast right now.
[2:53:21.160 --> 2:53:27.840]  But I think the good news is that the United States of America is going to
[2:53:27.840 --> 2:53:33.600]  have to pay the piper at some point for all the things that have gone on in the
[2:53:33.600 --> 2:53:37.440]  last whatever, you know. Stay there. We're coming back to the full audience.
[2:53:37.440 --> 2:53:46.960]  Stay there. Stay there. Here we go. Congressman Dan Hamburg is our guest.
[2:53:46.960 --> 2:53:50.720]  He's been predicting and writing about the martial law takeover. Something else
[2:53:50.720 --> 2:53:54.320]  is happening. I was at a little restaurant yesterday grabbing some
[2:53:54.320 --> 2:53:57.920]  tacos and I heard people talking about, did you hear? All the banks will be shut
[2:53:57.920 --> 2:54:02.680]  next week. Everything's going to shut down. It's over. Runs on the banks. And then
[2:54:02.680 --> 2:54:05.400]  I got back to the office and Rob was in there going, man, I'm getting all these
[2:54:05.400 --> 2:54:09.240]  emails about from, you know, family and people that aren't even into this stuff
[2:54:09.240 --> 2:54:11.960]  about how all the banks are going to shut down next week. And it wouldn't really
[2:54:11.960 --> 2:54:17.320]  see where it was from. We tracked it back to a reported white supremacist who is a
[2:54:17.320 --> 2:54:20.800]  caricature of white supremacist. I'm not defending white supremacist, but I mean,
[2:54:20.800 --> 2:54:26.520]  it's very clownish. And it's Hal Turner. I don't like giving the guy attention. And
[2:54:26.520 --> 2:54:30.640]  I mean, he says things, you know, that if I said them or somebody else said to me
[2:54:30.640 --> 2:54:35.080]  be arrested, he says, go, you know, blast judges, politicians, go physically
[2:54:35.080 --> 2:54:40.320]  attack people, names, names, you know, does, you know, ridiculous parodies of
[2:54:40.320 --> 2:54:45.640]  black people calling him, you know, just every name in the book. And then, of course,
[2:54:45.640 --> 2:54:48.320]  it turns out that he's tied in with these white supremacist groups that has
[2:54:48.320 --> 2:54:53.600]  turned out the leaders are feds. And then it did come out stories up on info wars
[2:54:53.640 --> 2:54:59.720]  dot com prison planet dot com. And it's titled Paul Watson story, hoax bank
[2:54:59.720 --> 2:55:04.840]  closure story pedals bailout propaganda. No surprise. We learned the source of the
[2:55:04.840 --> 2:55:11.000]  hoax is Hal Turner who was exposed earlier this year as an FBI informant posing
[2:55:11.000 --> 2:55:14.760]  as a white supremacist. And he's the guy that comes out with with the marrow
[2:55:14.760 --> 2:55:18.120]  coins that some private meant does and then discredits the fact that they are
[2:55:18.120 --> 2:55:22.240]  setting up in a marrow. Or he's the guy that hoax after hoax after hoax after
[2:55:22.240 --> 2:55:27.280]  hoax after hoax. But the the story he put out says we've got to have the bail
[2:55:27.280 --> 2:55:32.320]  out, or everything's destroyed. So it also always has an angle. Now this will
[2:55:32.320 --> 2:55:36.920]  be used to criticize the internet CNN hired reporters that then put out fake
[2:55:36.920 --> 2:55:41.760]  stories about Steve Jobs having a heart attack yesterday. Now CNN saying we
[2:55:41.760 --> 2:55:44.840]  better shut down the web and restrict free speech. Look what independent
[2:55:44.840 --> 2:55:48.600]  people do. But the guy works for them. And then they're also saying they want
[2:55:48.600 --> 2:55:52.000]  to shut the web down censor it. We were talking about it behind the scenes on
[2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:55.840]  the internet streams and not just them and FM, but they're in the break at
[2:55:55.840 --> 2:56:02.240]  prisonplanet.tv with our guest, the Congressman. So internet to Lieberman,
[2:56:02.240 --> 2:56:05.560]  YouTube and Google are now banning whatever the government wants. I mean
[2:56:05.560 --> 2:56:09.120]  it's happening and they're using people like this to do it. And this is what
[2:56:09.120 --> 2:56:12.240]  can cause bank runs, ladies and gentlemen. You've heard Bush saying bank
[2:56:12.240 --> 2:56:15.920]  run, bank run. We don't want bank runs. Your money's safe. Bank run. You know,
[2:56:15.920 --> 2:56:19.840]  trying to make people bank run. The government wants to make this worse
[2:56:19.840 --> 2:56:24.120]  right now. Congressman? Well, I think that's right. You know, I think the
[2:56:24.120 --> 2:56:28.600]  worse it gets, the more the more people panic. And we know from Hitler's
[2:56:28.600 --> 2:56:32.720]  minister of propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, that there's nothing that makes people
[2:56:32.720 --> 2:56:36.440]  more malleable than when they're in a state of panic and they want, you know,
[2:56:36.440 --> 2:56:41.160]  anything that will relieve their panic, they will go for it. And this is the
[2:56:41.160 --> 2:56:46.440]  bet that they're making. They're believing that if they, you know, they've
[2:56:46.440 --> 2:56:51.000]  already shredded the Constitution and they believe that now if they, you know,
[2:56:51.000 --> 2:56:56.080]  tank the economy, they will frighten people and then they will come up with
[2:56:56.080 --> 2:57:03.120]  their plan to save them. And it'll be, it'll be us, the people, the
[2:57:03.120 --> 2:57:07.920]  citizens of this country, the people who with our taxes have been supporting this
[2:57:07.920 --> 2:57:13.840]  entire charade, who are going to be left, you know, with basically
[2:57:13.840 --> 2:57:20.680]  nothing. I mean, I think the strategy is to put all of us ordinary people in a
[2:57:20.680 --> 2:57:25.360]  subservient position where we no longer really have anything to say about the
[2:57:25.360 --> 2:57:30.720]  way we're governed and we enter this, this new world order in which the global
[2:57:30.720 --> 2:57:37.400]  economy and a small financial, military, political, industrial elite makes all the
[2:57:37.400 --> 2:57:41.000]  decisions for the rest of us. And it really, you know, some people have said
[2:57:41.000 --> 2:57:45.560]  that the problem with this bailout is that, you know, we have capitalism on the
[2:57:45.560 --> 2:57:49.800]  way up and socialism on the way down. But the characterization that makes more
[2:57:49.800 --> 2:57:54.680]  sense to me is that we're now in an area of authoritarian capitalism. And
[2:57:54.680 --> 2:57:58.560]  absolutely. And they probably believe that people are not the authorities. That's
[2:57:58.560 --> 2:58:04.360]  right. They privatize profit and they socialize laws and they pass it on the
[2:58:04.360 --> 2:58:07.920]  average people. It's feudalism. Stay there. We'll be back in one minute for five
[2:58:07.920 --> 2:58:19.440]  more minutes with our guest.

[2:59:20.240 --> 2:59:37.280]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. We are now into
[2:59:37.280 --> 2:59:43.280]  our number four. Coming up in about 15 minutes. Congressman Brad Sherman, it was
[2:59:43.280 --> 2:59:50.000]  told, vote for this or we'll declare physical martial law. Ron Paul, probably
[2:59:50.000 --> 2:59:55.320]  popping in to comment on the bailout passing. This is the banker takeover.
[2:59:55.320 --> 3:00:00.480]  Former Congressman Dan Hamburg joins us for major articles for major
[3:00:00.480 --> 3:00:03.240]  publications detailing how they were planning this controlled financial
[3:00:03.240 --> 3:00:07.880]  implosion 16 months ago. It was one of the bigger ones in the San Francisco
[3:00:07.880 --> 3:00:12.640]  Chronicle. He's with us for about five more minutes. You heard him say they're
[3:00:12.640 --> 3:00:16.320]  coming after the web. They're attacking the web. That's their main target and a
[3:00:16.320 --> 3:00:19.960]  false flag attack that's even come out in mainstream news. They launch red
[3:00:19.960 --> 3:00:25.000]  regulations, taxes, it's all happening and they have their reported agents, FBI
[3:00:25.000 --> 3:00:29.000]  informant, their reported FBI informant putting out a hoax that's gotten
[3:00:29.000 --> 3:00:33.040]  traction I've never seen and he's put out a bunch of hoaxes before and believe
[3:00:33.040 --> 3:00:35.200]  me, I don't want to get in a fight with this guy, but I have to for the
[3:00:35.200 --> 3:00:39.960]  Republic. Very dangerous crew around him. Ladies and gentlemen, there's a big
[3:00:39.960 --> 3:00:43.520]  history of white supremacy being fed. It's come out in the news in Texas
[3:00:43.520 --> 3:00:48.720]  monthly and Reuters everywhere. It's kept very quiet, but it's out there for you
[3:00:48.720 --> 3:00:52.120]  saying, you know, that all the banks are going to shut down next week and this has
[3:00:52.120 --> 3:00:56.040]  gotten huge traction. They're talking about on the street in Austin. We can
[3:00:56.040 --> 3:01:00.640]  combat this. Go get our article, hoax bank, closure story, pedals, bailout
[3:01:00.640 --> 3:01:04.600]  propaganda, get it, get it out to everybody you know and fight this lie.
[3:01:04.600 --> 3:01:09.720]  And again, it mirrors the winehouse saying, do everything we say, give us all
[3:01:09.720 --> 3:01:13.960]  the power or depression. They want to orchestrate it to bring in their solution.
[3:01:13.960 --> 3:01:18.840]  Help us get the story out that martial law was threatened on Congress and now
[3:01:18.840 --> 3:01:22.640]  they've signed over martial law power financially. Dr. Paul Craig Roberts said
[3:01:22.640 --> 3:01:27.280]  that an hour and a half ago here. I mean, this is, we've got the key info up on
[3:01:27.280 --> 3:01:33.280]  info wars.com and prisonplanet.com. Help us counter the lies. Now is the key time
[3:01:33.280 --> 3:01:36.400]  in the battle because the people are against what the criminal groups and
[3:01:36.400 --> 3:01:40.160]  the government are doing these cartels. And so they're really ready to hear the
[3:01:40.160 --> 3:01:44.200]  truth right now. Congressman, how important is this? You have Brad Sherman on
[3:01:44.200 --> 3:01:49.080]  and when you have Ron Paul on later, I hope that you ask them if they
[3:01:49.080 --> 3:01:56.040]  understand what Bush did on August 28th when he extended the so-called state of
[3:01:56.040 --> 3:02:02.160]  national emergency and extended by implication and I'm sure by law,
[3:02:02.160 --> 3:02:09.400]  HSPD 20 and NSPD 51. I don't believe and I've discussed this with one of the
[3:02:09.400 --> 3:02:13.960]  national authorities on it, Peter Dale Scott. I don't believe that Congress is
[3:02:13.960 --> 3:02:17.920]  even aware of their statutory responsibilities under the National
[3:02:17.920 --> 3:02:22.480]  Emergencies Act to review the state, any state of emergency declared by the
[3:02:22.480 --> 3:02:27.320]  president by statute has to be reviewed by the House and the Senate with
[3:02:27.320 --> 3:02:32.640]  resolutions passed to continue them every six months and in nearly what has
[3:02:32.640 --> 3:02:40.880]  been seven years since 9-11, there has never, never once been a
[3:02:40.880 --> 3:02:46.200]  session of the House or the Senate in which the state of emergency has been
[3:02:46.200 --> 3:02:51.720]  even acknowledged to exist. And Congressman, what you're saying is key. We have
[3:02:51.720 --> 3:02:56.800]  been on the stove with the martial law turned on simmer. They are now jacking it
[3:02:56.800 --> 3:03:02.280]  up to high. Well, that's exactly right and they do have these measures in
[3:03:02.280 --> 3:03:08.480]  place. In fact, we know how bad they are by what we can see, but when Peter
[3:03:08.480 --> 3:03:14.120]  Defazio and Benny Thompson and members of the House Security Committee
[3:03:14.120 --> 3:03:18.920]  tried to find out what was in the the agenda under which we, the United
[3:03:18.920 --> 3:03:22.320]  States of America, are being ruled, they were told that they were not
[3:03:22.320 --> 3:03:27.120]  prived. They were not going to be allowed to see this information. And then the
[3:03:27.120 --> 3:03:30.600]  chairman asked for it. So as a former congressman, what does that mean when
[3:03:30.600 --> 3:03:35.160]  the White House, the executive, tells the legislative, which is co-equal, that
[3:03:35.160 --> 3:03:38.400]  they're not allowed to be involved in that? That is dictatorship of the
[3:03:38.400 --> 3:03:43.840]  executive. Well, it absolutely is. And that's why I'm saying we are already under
[3:03:43.840 --> 3:03:50.080]  this so-called continuity of government, you know, this cog formulation by
[3:03:50.080 --> 3:03:56.080]  virtue of the fact that the Congress has become basically the
[3:03:56.080 --> 3:04:00.640]  procedural. Basically, the Congress is no longer a co-equal branch of the
[3:04:00.640 --> 3:04:04.080]  government. Okay, we're going to end the main demonstration of that. We've got to
[3:04:04.080 --> 3:04:07.480]  end the main interview with you and the other congressman is coming up in
[3:04:07.480 --> 3:04:11.640]  about 10 minutes, but for the internet listeners and the prisonplanet.tv viewers,
[3:04:11.640 --> 3:04:15.920]  let's do three final minutes with you about solutions and folks can later see
[3:04:15.920 --> 3:04:20.080]  that on prisonplanet.tv and when it's ripped all over the web. So we'll do
[3:04:20.080 --> 3:04:23.480]  three more minutes with our guest, the honorable congressman, Dan Hamburg, and
[3:04:23.480 --> 3:04:30.080]  then we will get our next sitting congressman on for you as well. Okay, sir,
[3:04:30.080 --> 3:04:33.160]  literally you've got the floor for the next three minutes. I got a multitask.
[3:04:33.160 --> 3:04:37.400]  I'm going to run out of here and go work on the Ron Paul deal with a call that
[3:04:37.400 --> 3:04:40.680]  just came in. So you got three minutes, congressman, to revise and extend your
[3:04:40.680 --> 3:04:50.360]  remarks. Okay, well, I'm very glad to have a few minutes to talk to Alex's
[3:04:50.360 --> 3:04:57.560]  audience out there and to let them know that there are many of us
[3:04:57.560 --> 3:05:03.240]  out there and even some of us who have served in Congress who realized that
[3:05:03.240 --> 3:05:10.480]  bailing out the rich, that $700 billion bailouts, which could end up
[3:05:10.480 --> 3:05:16.440]  being much more than that, are certainly not in the interest of the people of
[3:05:16.440 --> 3:05:21.320]  this country. And when you hear some of the figures that are being used by
[3:05:21.320 --> 3:05:28.600]  people like Congressman Dennis Kucinich who says that the overall quantity of
[3:05:28.600 --> 3:05:33.360]  debt that the American people are going to be shouldering for generations to come
[3:05:33.360 --> 3:05:42.760]  is in the many, many trillions of dollars. He actually used the figure at
[3:05:42.760 --> 3:05:48.880]  quarter of a quadrillion. I have never heard the term quadrillion used before.
[3:05:48.880 --> 3:05:53.760]  I heard Dennis Kucinich speaking of it the other day. So what they have done
[3:05:53.760 --> 3:05:59.280]  in a short period of time, now remember when Clinton was in office and I
[3:05:59.280 --> 3:06:03.320]  did not like Bill Clinton. In fact, it was during Clinton's second administration
[3:06:03.320 --> 3:06:07.400]  that I left the Democratic Party and became a member of the Green Party, but
[3:06:07.400 --> 3:06:14.480]  it was during those years that the country actually built up a budget
[3:06:14.480 --> 3:06:21.360]  surplus. And when George Bush came into office, I predicted that he would crash
[3:06:21.360 --> 3:06:28.000]  the economy in a short period of time, and he has done that. And you can't look
[3:06:28.000 --> 3:06:31.400]  at what has happened over the last eight years and think that it was not
[3:06:31.400 --> 3:06:41.720]  willful. It was willful. They do have a very strange plan in place under which
[3:06:41.720 --> 3:06:48.040]  they will become more powerful and we will become less powerful. And our
[3:06:48.040 --> 3:06:53.440]  constitutional rights have been compromised again and again and again.
[3:06:53.440 --> 3:07:00.040]  Our role as taxpayers has become compromised to where we are paying, we,
[3:07:00.040 --> 3:07:05.720]  the people, are paying for the sins of the few and the greed and the corruption
[3:07:05.720 --> 3:07:12.240]  of the few. And we have to put a stop to it. You know, we simply have to say no.
[3:07:12.240 --> 3:07:22.200]  We may in a short period of time have to not only say no, but speak no in ways
[3:07:22.200 --> 3:07:26.760]  that we have never been called on to do before. Alright, the gentleman's time has
[3:07:26.760 --> 3:07:29.680]  expired. We're gonna come back to the full audience. I want you to plug your
[3:07:29.680 --> 3:07:33.880]  great websites with a lot of information. We'll close this out. Here we go.
[3:07:33.880 --> 3:07:40.120]  Enemy lines. The information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[3:07:40.120 --> 3:07:46.480]  network. Alright, Congressman, in closing, tell us about a couple of your websites.
[3:07:46.480 --> 3:07:48.720]  People can check out some of the articles you've written and the research
[3:07:48.720 --> 3:07:52.600]  you've done documenting everything you've been saying.
[3:07:52.600 --> 3:07:59.000]  Myself and my co-author, Louis Seiler, we have several articles that are up on our
[3:07:59.000 --> 3:08:07.040]  website, many articles, www.voicingenvironment.org. Also, www.voteaction.org. You can see the
[3:08:07.040 --> 3:08:10.920]  articles we've written. A recent article we wrote on state of emergency the last
[3:08:10.920 --> 3:08:14.760]  six months of the Bush administration. Many of the things that we were talking
[3:08:14.760 --> 3:08:19.960]  about in that article, sadly, now seem to be coming to pass. And we need all the
[3:08:19.960 --> 3:08:23.160]  major papers that aren't fully controlled to report on this now and expose what's
[3:08:23.160 --> 3:08:26.800]  happening. It is really the end of the Republic unless we use this attempted
[3:08:26.800 --> 3:08:30.960]  push, this hunt to expose these criminals and remove them.
[3:08:30.960 --> 3:08:34.000]  Congressman, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[3:08:34.000 --> 3:08:36.360]  It's my pleasure, Alex. Good luck.
[3:08:36.360 --> 3:08:40.040]  Yeah, good night and good luck and God bless you. Take care.
[3:08:40.040 --> 3:08:42.640]  Alright, and the five minutes or so while we're waiting for the next
[3:08:42.640 --> 3:08:46.640]  Congressman, sitting Congressman Brad Sherman to call in. I want to play and
[3:08:46.640 --> 3:08:49.960]  then later we'll put the rest of it. This is in like just a few minutes into
[3:08:49.960 --> 3:08:54.680]  Matrix of Evil where I go before the city council with over a thousand others but
[3:08:54.680 --> 3:08:58.880]  only about a hundred got to speak because of time constraints for four hours and
[3:08:58.880 --> 3:09:02.480]  expose the Patriot Act and lay out what's now happening. We'll play as much of
[3:09:02.480 --> 3:09:07.360]  this as we can while we get the Congressman on. Here it is.
[3:09:07.360 --> 3:09:11.600]  Okay. Okay, so Mr. Jones, you're now at your maximum of 15 minutes. I will just
[3:09:11.600 --> 3:09:16.040]  will say folks, occasionally you'll see myself or council members leaving the
[3:09:16.040 --> 3:09:21.080]  dais. I promise you when we're back in the back there's a television and audio we
[3:09:21.080 --> 3:09:26.720]  can hear and see. Oh, yes, I believe you. Don't be offended. When I leave, I'm not
[3:09:26.720 --> 3:09:31.120]  offended. Welcome, Mr. Jones. You have 15 minutes. Well, thank you and I hope you
[3:09:31.120 --> 3:09:33.840]  do stay because this is important and I want to thank the people that came here
[3:09:33.840 --> 3:09:39.040]  that are part of the second American Revolution we shall prevail. That is a
[3:09:39.040 --> 3:09:47.440]  guarantee because as the new world order turns up the heat, they're gonna form
[3:09:47.440 --> 3:09:51.560]  more resistance. The tighter they squeeze, the more people are gonna have that
[3:09:51.560 --> 3:09:55.600]  light bulb go off above their head. Now, I believe this council has made up of
[3:09:55.600 --> 3:10:00.520]  good people and I think it's great that Jackie Goodman, Mayor Proteum, has brought
[3:10:00.520 --> 3:10:07.120]  this forward. Let's go through the facts and John Ashcroft and Lord Bush and
[3:10:07.120 --> 3:10:11.060]  their military industrial complex owners who are setting up military
[3:10:11.060 --> 3:10:15.160]  dictatorship. I mean, this is admitted, the ENAC documents cannot hide the
[3:10:15.160 --> 3:10:19.520]  reality of what's happening. In fact, Ashcroft, six months ago, really
[3:10:19.520 --> 3:10:23.360]  committed a federal crime in sworn testimony for the House and Senate. He said
[3:10:23.360 --> 3:10:27.360]  there is no new terrorism legislation. It's not been introduced. The Domestic
[3:10:27.360 --> 3:10:31.000]  Security and Hansmen Act, the Justice Domestic Security Hansmen Act, House and
[3:10:31.000 --> 3:10:33.840]  Senate versions. It's like if I got here and said the sun didn't come up this
[3:10:33.840 --> 3:10:38.120]  morning, he'd laugh at me, but the press didn't call him on it. Now he's saying
[3:10:38.120 --> 3:10:41.480]  there is a Patriot Act 2 and Victory Act 1 and Victory Act 2 and you better pass
[3:10:41.480 --> 3:10:46.400]  all of them. You know what's in Patriot Act 2, Section 501? You fit the
[3:10:46.400 --> 3:10:50.840]  description of a terrorist under Section 802 of the first Patriot Act. You can be
[3:10:50.840 --> 3:10:58.800]  arrested, it's secretly executed. That's right, a three military judge panel. Now
[3:10:58.800 --> 3:11:06.280]  what is Section 802 of the first Patriot Act that passed on October 27th, 2001 to
[3:11:06.280 --> 3:11:09.280]  five in the morning when no one was allowed to read it, according to members
[3:11:09.280 --> 3:11:13.720]  of Congress? The definition of terrorist is any action that endangers human
[3:11:13.720 --> 3:11:18.080]  life that is a violation of any federal or state law. They have many other
[3:11:18.080 --> 3:11:22.480]  definitions about anything that influences government. Go read it for yourself.
[3:11:22.480 --> 3:11:25.760]  They're counting on you not reading it. They're counting on you not finding it.
[3:11:25.760 --> 3:11:31.160]  Ron Paul and others have pointed out that Hitler and Stalin and people didn't
[3:11:31.160 --> 3:11:34.840]  have the nerve to put stuff like this down on paper. They just did it. That's
[3:11:34.840 --> 3:11:41.960]  what's so amazing about this. And to see the assistant U.S. attorney here
[3:11:41.960 --> 3:11:47.760]  peddling this is really sad, but I know it's under orders because two months ago
[3:11:47.760 --> 3:11:51.760]  it was reported that Ashcroft met out in Hollywood with the heads, the big editors
[3:11:51.760 --> 3:11:55.840]  of all the newspapers, and the heads of law enforcement. And it said we'd like you
[3:11:55.840 --> 3:11:58.760]  to go out and write editorials, editors, we'd like U.S. attorneys, assistant
[3:11:58.760 --> 3:12:02.960]  attorneys, write editorials, get on talk shows. Two months ago it was reported
[3:12:02.960 --> 3:12:06.640]  that Ashcroft met out in Hollywood with the heads, the big editors of all the
[3:12:06.640 --> 3:12:10.800]  newspapers, and the heads of law enforcement. And it said we'd like you to go out
[3:12:10.800 --> 3:12:13.520]  and write editorials, editors, we'd like U.S. attorneys, assistant attorneys,
[3:12:13.520 --> 3:12:19.000]  write editorials, get on talk shows, get out there and sell that this is the
[3:12:19.000 --> 3:12:24.040]  people, that this is good, this is a wonderful thing. So I want the council,
[3:12:24.040 --> 3:12:28.320]  in case you don't know this, and the people here today to understand that
[3:12:28.320 --> 3:12:33.240]  it's a stage-managed event. I mean, it really was hatched in a smoky room to
[3:12:33.240 --> 3:12:38.760]  oppress you, to manipulate you, to con you. That makes me very angry, and that's
[3:12:38.760 --> 3:12:43.520]  why it's so exciting that this council may simply just say we have a bill of
[3:12:43.520 --> 3:12:47.920]  rights and constitution, and we will not violate the bill of rights and
[3:12:47.920 --> 3:12:52.240]  constitution, and in this city, America is still America. I mean, it's just that
[3:12:52.240 --> 3:12:57.840]  simple. Now, I'm sure you heard about five years ago about the FBI crime lab,
[3:12:57.840 --> 3:13:00.680]  the head of it, Dr. Frederick Wyhurst, who I've interviewed several times, said,
[3:13:00.680 --> 3:13:03.760]  I'm not doing this anymore. We've been framing people, manufacturing evidence.
[3:13:03.760 --> 3:13:09.160]  This is out of control. I've interviewed FBI agent Tyrone Powers, who talked
[3:13:09.160 --> 3:13:12.080]  about how they would frame people, the different criminal things that they
[3:13:12.080 --> 3:13:17.480]  would do. Two Leah, Texas, 56 black people, no criminal record, no drug
[3:13:17.480 --> 3:13:23.760]  paraphernalia, no nothing. On the word of one, corrupt cop gave them all 20 to 90
[3:13:23.760 --> 3:13:30.600]  years in prison. Now, you think about that. Houston crime lab, thousands framed
[3:13:30.600 --> 3:13:36.000]  indiscriminately. The police chief had to admit it, because his job's on the line.
[3:13:36.000 --> 3:13:39.520]  He's claiming, oh, I'm going to fix that problem. It's equivalent of
[3:13:39.520 --> 3:13:44.680]  Harriman Goering, you know, promising to stop what Hitler was up to. This is
[3:13:44.680 --> 3:13:48.880]  amazing, ladies and gentlemen. So this is why we restrict the scope and size of
[3:13:48.880 --> 3:13:52.000]  government, and it's powered over us in our lives, because we know there's
[3:13:52.000 --> 3:13:54.800]  criminals on the street. We know there's bad people, but they don't have the
[3:13:54.800 --> 3:13:59.680]  massive mechanisms, the machinery of government, and military, and militarized
[3:13:59.680 --> 3:14:08.600]  police, and prison complexes to oppress at levels. Alex, are you there?
[3:14:08.600 --> 3:14:12.960]  Hello? Yeah, we're on air right now, streaming off on the internet. Okay, I got
[3:14:12.960 --> 3:14:15.640]  your guess. All right, here we go. Thank you. So don't tell me, Lita, we shouldn't
[3:14:15.640 --> 3:14:20.360]  have a concern when the most draconian legislation in the history of the world
[3:14:20.360 --> 3:14:28.200]  dwarfing Byzantine Spain and France. He's rolled out against the people. All
[3:14:28.200 --> 3:14:33.960]  right, ladies and gentlemen, that was going back, what, four years ago when we
[3:14:33.960 --> 3:14:37.120]  got Austin to throw out the Patriot Act and say the Bill of Rights and
[3:14:37.120 --> 3:14:40.280]  Constitution still existed, and before the show ends, I'm going to air the rest of
[3:14:40.280 --> 3:14:43.240]  my speech there. We'll back it up a little bit so you can hear it all. That's
[3:14:43.240 --> 3:14:48.680]  from the film, Matrix of Evil. I am very honored to have Congressman Brad
[3:14:48.680 --> 3:14:56.000]  Sherman on the air with us. Harvard Law School, this is education, JD, Magna Cum
[3:14:56.000 --> 3:15:01.920]  Laude, UCLA, BA, he goes on, instructor, Harvard Law School International Tax
[3:15:01.920 --> 3:15:05.480]  Program. His bio goes on and on, so he can certainly speak to the fact of
[3:15:05.480 --> 3:15:08.320]  martial law. We've talked to other congressmen here on there that have
[3:15:08.320 --> 3:15:12.240]  said yes, they've been threatened with the U.S. collapsing, martial law being
[3:15:12.240 --> 3:15:18.360]  installed, the Army has announced in the Army times that, oh, Northcom's deploying
[3:15:18.360 --> 3:15:21.920]  a brigade, going to bring others in for civil unrest, we'll use our microwave
[3:15:21.920 --> 3:15:26.440]  cannons on the people. I mean, this is all happening in the last week, and we
[3:15:26.440 --> 3:15:31.160]  saw the financial terrorism of the White House saying, pass this bill, give us
[3:15:31.160 --> 3:15:36.760]  immunity, give us all this power, or we're going to have a depression, and then it
[3:15:36.760 --> 3:15:40.400]  didn't pass Monday, so the market dropped 1 trillion, 200 billion. If that is an
[3:15:40.400 --> 3:15:44.040]  economic terrorism, I don't know what is, so we have the congressman almost only
[3:15:44.040 --> 3:15:47.520]  happened for five minutes, five, six minutes. Congressman Brad Sherman, thank
[3:15:47.520 --> 3:15:53.880]  you for coming on, sir. Good to be with you. You know, Wall Street used these
[3:15:53.880 --> 3:16:00.320]  panic tactics to get us to pass this $700 billion. Well, what the bill really is,
[3:16:00.320 --> 3:16:05.160]  is $700 billion in unmarked bills. They said the market would drop by 4,000
[3:16:05.160 --> 3:16:10.560]  points, blood would flow in the streets, and lions would be devouring children in
[3:16:10.560 --> 3:16:16.080]  the parks of Los Angeles. Now that the bill has passed, our economy is still
[3:16:16.080 --> 3:16:21.480]  going to be very bad in the fall and winter, but the Wall Street folks will
[3:16:21.480 --> 3:16:26.720]  come out and say, well, it was a great bill, after all. There are no lions in
[3:16:26.720 --> 3:16:32.560]  the parks of Los Angeles, so we've got to do everything we can to
[3:16:32.560 --> 3:16:37.800]  focus people's attention on this bill as it's carried out, because it allows
[3:16:37.800 --> 3:16:43.200]  Paulson to go up to Wall Street, he can give money to one firm, he can not
[3:16:43.200 --> 3:16:50.120]  return phone calls from another firm, he can, if you want,
[3:16:50.120 --> 3:16:54.760]  find out which firms are donating to the 527 organizations, which take
[3:16:54.760 --> 3:16:58.760]  secret contributions and then make political advertising, he can look at the
[3:16:58.760 --> 3:17:02.840]  RNC donor list, he can do anything he wants. Congressman, I know that you're
[3:17:02.840 --> 3:17:06.680]  moving forward now as a good Congressman would for your constituents now that the
[3:17:06.680 --> 3:17:10.120]  corruption has passed through economic terrorism, but let's go back to what you
[3:17:10.120 --> 3:17:14.600]  said on the floor in the last 24 hours about members of Congress, and I've
[3:17:14.600 --> 3:17:17.800]  talked to some, they're afraid to even come on and talk about it being told,
[3:17:17.800 --> 3:17:21.320]  there will be martial law in America and we'll just do this with or without you
[3:17:21.320 --> 3:17:25.200]  if you don't do this. That is incredible, and I just had the former head of the
[3:17:25.200 --> 3:17:29.400]  Treasury on earlier, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts from Reagan, had a policy saying
[3:17:29.400 --> 3:17:36.720]  that this gives them economic martial law. Well, I know that some
[3:17:36.720 --> 3:17:41.720]  comments like that were made, I didn't take them seriously, I know some would,
[3:17:41.720 --> 3:17:48.480]  I thought it was just an overblown effort to create a panic in order to pass a
[3:17:48.480 --> 3:17:52.200]  bad bill. Is that not terrorism? I mean, it's not the definition to
[3:17:52.200 --> 3:17:57.720]  threaten harm or carry out harm for a political aim, sir? Well, they didn't say
[3:17:57.720 --> 3:18:04.920]  they'd shoot anybody, so usually terrorism involves threats of violence
[3:18:04.920 --> 3:18:12.640]  and whether a drop in the dow is violent or not, I mean, I'm sure that somebody
[3:18:12.640 --> 3:18:17.480]  who had a heart attack when the market dropped a few hundred points, but keep
[3:18:17.480 --> 3:18:21.560]  in mind, we passed the bill and I'm told the market is down. Is it not?
[3:18:21.560 --> 3:18:25.240]  Well, sir, we have cyber terrorism, they call hacking terrorism, one of the
[3:18:25.240 --> 3:18:30.680]  Patriot Act, Section 802, any action, you know, they claimed it is even a
[3:18:30.680 --> 3:18:34.080]  misdemeanorist terrorism, I mean, to have a trillion, two hundred
[3:18:34.080 --> 3:18:38.040]  billion dollar loss in one day with them fear mongering, I call that economic
[3:18:38.040 --> 3:18:43.800]  terrorism. Well, I don't think of it as that big a loss, that was, you know, if
[3:18:43.800 --> 3:18:50.480]  somebody on the other side of town sells their house at a fire sale price, I
[3:18:50.480 --> 3:18:54.480]  don't really think that makes me think all of a sudden I'm a lot poorer.
[3:18:54.480 --> 3:18:59.520]  I understand. There are a few people who sold at fire sale prices on last
[3:18:59.520 --> 3:19:04.720]  Monday and the fact is, if they held, I mean, the same people say we lost a
[3:19:04.720 --> 3:19:09.360]  trillion dollars Monday would say, well, we made back two-thirds of a trillion
[3:19:09.360 --> 3:19:14.240]  Tuesday. The whole GDP of this country is only 14 trillion. I don't think we made
[3:19:14.240 --> 3:19:18.320]  a trillion or lost a trillion on anyone. Sir, here's the 64 million dollar
[3:19:18.320 --> 3:19:21.720]  question. You and other members of Congress say, yeah, well, there were some
[3:19:21.720 --> 3:19:25.040]  people threatening martial law, but we don't, you know, you know, think they
[3:19:25.040 --> 3:19:29.680]  meant it. They were just trying to fear monger, which I call terrorism into it.
[3:19:29.680 --> 3:19:34.400]  That's a huge issue. Specifically, sir, we need to know names. Who told you that
[3:19:34.400 --> 3:19:38.680]  they were told that martial law and blood in the streets, as you said, what
[3:19:38.680 --> 3:19:43.800]  happened? Private conversations between members on the floor. You really can't
[3:19:43.800 --> 3:19:46.800]  reveal without the permission of the other party. I understand, but were there
[3:19:46.800 --> 3:19:50.000]  arm twisters coming up or were they scared? I mean, how was it said
[3:19:50.000 --> 3:19:53.400]  specifically? I think these were people who really believe what they were
[3:19:53.400 --> 3:19:57.480]  saying. I don't think these were people who were, you know, got called by
[3:19:57.480 --> 3:20:04.240]  Goldman Sachs and said, well, go say this or go say that. The panic takes a
[3:20:04.240 --> 3:20:09.080]  life of its own. One person says, market will drop 2,000 points. Somebody else is
[3:20:09.080 --> 3:20:13.800]  2,500. Somebody else is 3,000. Somebody else says, the
[3:20:13.800 --> 3:20:17.480]  unemployment will jump immediately to 9%. Somebody hears that. It's spreading. It's
[3:20:17.480 --> 3:20:21.960]  worse and worse. So something. I don't think there was, or at least I'm not
[3:20:21.960 --> 3:20:30.240]  aware of this being, you know, carefully orchestrated. But I think now what we
[3:20:30.240 --> 3:20:35.040]  have to do is expose those circumstances where we're bailing out a
[3:20:35.040 --> 3:20:39.520]  particular firm and how many of the executives at firm are continuing to
[3:20:39.520 --> 3:20:42.720]  make a million dollars a year, five million dollars a year, 20 million
[3:20:42.720 --> 3:20:47.840]  dollars a year. That's the message that needs to get out each and every time
[3:20:47.840 --> 3:20:52.680]  assets are purchased by Treasury on this. By the way, Congressman, you are, for
[3:20:52.680 --> 3:20:56.480]  the listeners, uniquely positioned to be able to comment on all this. You worked
[3:20:56.480 --> 3:21:01.400]  for some of the, you know, most important and prestigious firms doing audits of
[3:21:01.400 --> 3:21:05.880]  multinational corporations and of government entities. So you know what
[3:21:05.880 --> 3:21:09.560]  you're talking about. I know what I'm talking about, but there's going to be a
[3:21:09.560 --> 3:21:14.120]  lot of information that is not public and it's going to take investigative
[3:21:14.120 --> 3:21:17.480]  reporters to find out things that congressmen can't find out and that the
[3:21:17.480 --> 3:21:21.360]  public is not going to be aware of. You know, I have to, I have to go right now,
[3:21:21.360 --> 3:21:24.920]  but it's been a pleasure being with you. Sir, let us get you back on for longer
[3:21:24.920 --> 3:21:28.720]  than our future. Thank you, Congressman. Look forward to it. Thank you. We skipped
[3:21:28.720 --> 3:21:32.080]  that break as we got him on a few minutes late and then he only had about
[3:21:32.080 --> 3:21:35.960]  five, six minutes. So there you heard it, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah, there were
[3:21:35.960 --> 3:21:39.360]  people on the floor saying they were told martial law and literal blood in
[3:21:39.360 --> 3:21:43.120]  the streets if this didn't happen and they were told this, but I can't tell you
[3:21:43.120 --> 3:21:48.320]  who told me. Meanwhile, the army is in the army times saying, oh, we're here
[3:21:48.320 --> 3:21:51.480]  from, you know, for civil emergency martial law. The John Warner Defense
[3:21:51.480 --> 3:21:55.160]  Authorization Act says that the governors run nothing. Congress runs
[3:21:55.160 --> 3:22:00.320]  nothing. PDD 51. It's all there and this is being threatened. And now, according
[3:22:00.320 --> 3:22:03.840]  to Paul Craig Roberts, Dr. Roberts earlier, this gives economic martial law
[3:22:03.840 --> 3:22:09.120]  power to the treasury. So one way or the other, they got it. Now, I'm going to do
[3:22:09.120 --> 3:22:15.360]  this. I want to open the phones up. I want to open the phones up for people
[3:22:15.360 --> 3:22:19.160]  out there listening at the bottom of the hour, specifically on what you think of
[3:22:19.160 --> 3:22:24.160]  the banker takeover and the martial law and all of it. We're busting our butts
[3:22:24.160 --> 3:22:27.520]  here to bring you these congressmen, these eyewitnesses, these reports. We
[3:22:27.520 --> 3:22:32.240]  really appreciate all of you tuning in today. Record audiences. The internet's
[3:22:32.240 --> 3:22:37.440]  a small part of our audience, hundreds of thousands. But still, it's a key gauge
[3:22:37.440 --> 3:22:41.120]  and it's record streams listening on the info war streams, record people tuned
[3:22:41.120 --> 3:22:44.000]  in just there. I know there's record numbers listening on the FM dial
[3:22:44.000 --> 3:22:47.760]  shortwave satellite right now. The internet's an engage. By the way, I
[3:22:47.760 --> 3:22:51.680]  misspoke earlier. I said 83,000 people a day download the podcast. It's now
[3:22:51.680 --> 3:22:56.240]  98,000. In one week, it's grown to 98,000 a day downloading the free
[3:22:56.240 --> 3:23:01.920]  podcast at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com. Now, we skip this
[3:23:01.920 --> 3:23:06.320]  network break. Don't worry, sponsors will get your ads played just on a
[3:23:06.320 --> 3:23:11.280]  later day for that break there. But in times like these, we've got to take
[3:23:11.280 --> 3:23:15.040]  every minute we've got. So I didn't just skip that on the internet streams.
[3:23:15.040 --> 3:23:19.120]  We skip that network. Network wide. But I'm only going to give each caller
[3:23:19.120 --> 3:23:21.680]  about a minute. I'm really bad about taking long questions. They're not
[3:23:21.680 --> 3:23:24.800]  babble. I'm just going to let you have your say kind of like radio graffiti,
[3:23:24.800 --> 3:23:28.400]  as some call it. I'm not even going to comment much. I'm just going to let
[3:23:28.400 --> 3:23:33.600]  you have your rant. Be ready. 1-800-259-9231. The toll free number to
[3:23:33.600 --> 3:23:38.480]  join us 1-800-259-9231. A lot of days Ron Paul says I can definitely come
[3:23:38.480 --> 3:23:41.440]  up this time. And then he always comes on or sometimes something comes up and
[3:23:41.440 --> 3:23:44.720]  then he has to reschedule. He may be popping in still in the next 40
[3:23:44.720 --> 3:23:48.480]  minutes. So that might mess up some of those want to call in but barring him
[3:23:48.480 --> 3:23:52.240]  calling in during the calls will be taking will be going to those. I'm going to
[3:23:52.240 --> 3:23:55.040]  take a break right now for the next five minutes and finish up some of my
[3:23:55.040 --> 3:23:58.160]  speech before the city council in Austin four years ago back that up about
[3:23:58.160 --> 3:24:01.600]  20 seconds for listeners out there and we'll continue with how long ago we
[3:24:01.600 --> 3:24:05.120]  were warning everybody about the situation and we'll come back
[3:24:05.120 --> 3:24:08.720]  and we'll take the next break in about four minutes and then we'll come back
[3:24:08.720 --> 3:24:14.320]  and take your phone calls right here on the GCN radio network. Stay with us.
[3:24:14.320 --> 3:24:17.520]  That makes me very angry and that's why it's so exciting
[3:24:17.520 --> 3:24:22.560]  that this council may simply just say we have a bill of rights and constitution
[3:24:22.560 --> 3:24:27.360]  and we will not violate the bill of rights and constitution and in this city
[3:24:27.360 --> 3:24:32.160]  America is still America. I mean it's just that simple.
[3:24:32.160 --> 3:24:35.440]  Now I'm sure you heard about five years ago about the FBI crime lab the head of
[3:24:35.440 --> 3:24:38.240]  it Dr. Frederick Whitehurst who I've interviewed several times said I'm not
[3:24:38.240 --> 3:24:41.360]  doing this anymore we've been framing people manufacturing evidence this is
[3:24:41.360 --> 3:24:45.440]  out of control. I've interviewed at the age of Tyrone
[3:24:45.440 --> 3:24:48.960]  Powers who talked about how they would frame people the different criminal
[3:24:48.960 --> 3:24:53.600]  things they would do to Leah Texas 56 black people no
[3:24:53.600 --> 3:24:58.960]  criminal record no drug paraphernalia no nothing on the word a one corrupt cop
[3:24:58.960 --> 3:25:04.480]  gave them all 20 to 90 years in prison. Now you think about that
[3:25:04.480 --> 3:25:11.200]  Houston crime lab thousands framed indiscriminately the police chief had
[3:25:11.200 --> 3:25:14.320]  to admit it because his job's on the line he's claiming oh I'm
[3:25:14.320 --> 3:25:18.800]  I'm gonna fix that problem it's equivalent of Harriman Goering
[3:25:18.800 --> 3:25:21.680]  you know promising to stop what Hitler was up to.
[3:25:21.680 --> 3:25:25.840]  This is amazing ladies and gentlemen so this is why we restrict the scope and
[3:25:25.840 --> 3:25:28.640]  size of government and its power over us in our lives
[3:25:28.640 --> 3:25:31.520]  because we know there's criminals on the street we know there's bad people but
[3:25:31.520 --> 3:25:35.600]  they don't have the massive mechanisms the machinery of government and
[3:25:35.600 --> 3:25:42.320]  military and militarized police and prison complexes to oppress at levels
[3:25:42.320 --> 3:25:46.560]  never before seen last century 200 million killed by government
[3:25:46.560 --> 3:25:50.160]  200 million killed millions of American Indians Native Americans
[3:25:50.160 --> 3:25:54.080]  killed in this country so don't tell me we don't we shouldn't have a concern
[3:25:54.080 --> 3:25:58.240]  when the most draconian legislation in the history of the world
[3:25:58.240 --> 3:26:01.760]  dwarfing Byzantine Spain and France he's rolled out
[3:26:01.760 --> 3:26:04.640]  against the people
[3:26:10.800 --> 3:26:14.720]  now I could list the crimes I could list the crimes of the FBI
[3:26:14.720 --> 3:26:18.000]  the defense department state police local police
[3:26:18.000 --> 3:26:24.640]  all day long my point is history shows us that we must watch
[3:26:24.640 --> 3:26:28.400]  and we must control we must limit powerful men
[3:26:28.400 --> 3:26:32.080]  because power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely
[3:26:32.080 --> 3:26:36.960]  and I challenge I challenge members of this distinguished body
[3:26:36.960 --> 3:26:40.960]  to be part of history to not abstain to get out on the field
[3:26:40.960 --> 3:26:47.920]  in your life and you'll truly be alive to not sell out to this corrupt system
[3:26:47.920 --> 3:26:50.880]  you know I spoke right before Ron Paul just a few weeks ago right outside
[3:26:50.880 --> 3:26:54.480]  Austin he talked about how his his poll numbers just go up and up and up
[3:26:54.480 --> 3:26:57.440]  and the support just gets greater and greater and greater as he resists all
[3:26:57.440 --> 3:27:00.240]  of this and as he says no to this and as he throws the lobbyist out of his
[3:27:00.240 --> 3:27:03.600]  office the truth is when the whole world sold out
[3:27:03.600 --> 3:27:07.280]  you guys are going to get more power out of not going with the system
[3:27:07.280 --> 3:27:13.280]  this thing is in terminal velocity this thing is falling down around itself
[3:27:13.280 --> 3:27:18.160]  the corruption the comprehensive angle financial reports the scams
[3:27:18.160 --> 3:27:21.760]  now about nine minutes left i'm gonna try to go through these points because
[3:27:21.760 --> 3:27:25.040]  they're all very very important
[3:27:25.680 --> 3:27:29.600]  section 213 the first patriot act let's them break in your house or any business
[3:27:29.600 --> 3:27:32.160]  and take whatever they want or plant whatever they want and not tell you for
[3:27:32.160 --> 3:27:36.400]  six months they were there and they're administrative their rubber stamps
[3:27:36.400 --> 3:27:40.480]  they aren't for billy bob's house because we think he has this under the fourth
[3:27:40.480 --> 3:27:45.280]  amendment therefore everybody they're for whole classes of people
[3:27:45.280 --> 3:27:47.920]  and now into the new patriot act they have sections where they say our
[3:27:47.920 --> 3:27:51.200]  officers need not even need these administrative subpoenas or warrants
[3:27:51.200 --> 3:27:55.680]  they can just cart watch go anywhere they want for any crime or suspected crime
[3:27:55.680 --> 3:27:59.120]  and the spokesman for the justice department just a few
[3:27:59.120 --> 3:28:02.880]  months ago after ashcroft admit okay there is a patriot act too went before
[3:28:02.880 --> 3:28:06.800]  the house was in it and this was in the news and the associated press and said
[3:28:06.800 --> 3:28:10.240]  well yeah we're going to use this in all crimes all drug crimes everything
[3:28:10.240 --> 3:28:15.120]  misdemeanors third-degree felonies everything that's on the record
[3:28:15.120 --> 3:28:18.480]  u.s. attorneys deputy attorneys system attorneys all these people they're
[3:28:18.480 --> 3:28:20.080]  saying yeah we're going to use this for everything
[3:28:20.080 --> 3:28:23.760]  they are using it for everything the victory act which is a continual
[3:28:23.760 --> 3:28:27.520]  salvo in this attack on the american people
[3:28:27.520 --> 3:28:32.880]  clearly states that any possession of a controlled substance is an act of
[3:28:32.880 --> 3:28:36.000]  terrorism under section 802 pointing back to that
[3:28:36.000 --> 3:28:40.080]  enacting clause well it engages human life it's a weapon of mass destruction
[3:28:40.080 --> 3:28:43.520]  they've actually got articles in the news about oh yeah they're charging both
[3:28:43.520 --> 3:28:46.720]  weapons of mass destruction because they had marijuana
[3:28:46.720 --> 3:28:50.800]  we don't want to be part of this this is crazy people disappearing in the middle
[3:28:50.800 --> 3:28:53.280]  of the night i mean what did alexander schultz needs to say
[3:28:53.280 --> 3:28:56.560]  and do log on compelling of all how we burned in the camps
[3:28:56.560 --> 3:29:00.160]  later wishing that when the secret police went out at night to come to our
[3:29:00.160 --> 3:29:04.240]  doors we would have met them met them downstairs with
[3:29:04.240 --> 3:29:07.840]  pokers and axes and daggers

[3:39:11.120 --> 3:39:15.920]  i got you what about satellite radio well satellite radio is uh... owned by
[3:39:15.920 --> 3:39:19.520]  conglomerate uh... and they we've tried to get on they won't do it
[3:39:19.520 --> 3:39:23.120]  okay all right and then uh... plus it's a mouse that roars is only like eight
[3:39:23.120 --> 3:39:26.720]  million people with both marriage systems with five hundred something
[3:39:26.720 --> 3:39:29.920]  channels i mean they admit they're big other people who've gotten on there no
[3:39:29.920 --> 3:39:32.880]  response i mean a thousand watt a m gets a
[3:39:32.880 --> 3:39:35.040]  bigger response than your average serious channel
[3:39:35.040 --> 3:39:37.920]  i mean i know people that it's incredible you got
[3:39:37.920 --> 3:39:40.880]  think about you got how much more than a thousand channels now right but like
[3:39:40.880 --> 3:39:44.560]  five hundred main ones and then you got eight million subscribers
[3:39:44.560 --> 3:39:48.320]  divided into that divided into what's eight what's eight million divided by
[3:39:48.320 --> 3:39:52.160]  by five hundred and then you think about the fact that
[3:39:52.160 --> 3:39:55.920]  but the average serious or or xml sure what's now merge may listen maybe an
[3:39:55.920 --> 3:40:00.160]  hour to a day so you got maybe maybe maybe a million
[3:40:00.160 --> 3:40:05.200]  listening to anyone time because one of the problems i'm running into is uh
[3:40:05.200 --> 3:40:09.040]  just in kind of trying to spread you know the truth and stuff is that
[3:40:09.040 --> 3:40:13.360]  um it'll be information's out there and and people
[3:40:13.360 --> 3:40:17.440]  uh... they just aren't willing or just they don't want to believe it well joe
[3:40:17.440 --> 3:40:20.400]  they've got to see it over and over again i appreciate your call i told you
[3:40:20.400 --> 3:40:22.480]  folks we're gonna be talking about the bailout
[3:40:22.480 --> 3:40:26.240]  that passed a few hours ago and your response to your take to it and talk of
[3:40:26.240 --> 3:40:29.680]  the congress people being told literal martial law they didn't pass it blood in
[3:40:29.680 --> 3:40:32.160]  the streets you heard it from the congressman earlier wouldn't tell us
[3:40:32.160 --> 3:40:34.560]  who was saying on the floor but said it was quite a few people
[3:40:34.560 --> 3:40:36.800]  okay and i'm maddie joe but we're on topic here
[3:40:36.800 --> 3:40:41.040]  george in texas you're on the air you have formerly george of florida
[3:40:41.040 --> 3:40:44.640]  i moved to texas okay whatever go ahead i guess um
[3:40:44.640 --> 3:40:47.520]  i remember my dad telling me um on his deathbed
[3:40:47.520 --> 3:40:50.480]  he's retired commander of the marine corps and uh
[3:40:50.480 --> 3:40:53.520]  he was in a command meeting in camp lejeune and uh
[3:40:53.520 --> 3:40:56.960]  a member from the armed services committee told him this is back when
[3:40:56.960 --> 3:41:00.960]  nixon and told him don't follow the orders of the president because i think
[3:41:00.960 --> 3:41:04.640]  i think george w bush's nixon administration on steroids well that's
[3:41:04.640 --> 3:41:08.880]  right it came out in the mainstream news that the congress and the military
[3:41:08.880 --> 3:41:11.680]  they had meetings and they said the congress has elected the president
[3:41:11.680 --> 3:41:14.640]  has been proven to be a crook he may try to launch a war the
[3:41:14.640 --> 3:41:17.600]  the military found out he wanted to bomb his own convention
[3:41:17.600 --> 3:41:20.480]  that this is now in pbs this is declassified the tapes
[3:41:20.480 --> 3:41:24.160]  bomb his own convention and declare martial law so the military
[3:41:24.160 --> 3:41:27.680]  told all their commanders and all the branches do not do it
[3:41:27.680 --> 3:41:32.320]  today though uh they love the you know uh the black uniforms a little too much
[3:41:32.320 --> 3:41:37.120]  now most of them don't like it but we're not as moral as we were in the 70s
[3:41:37.120 --> 3:41:41.520]  uh yes um it's just uh like i say it's like nixon on steroids and you
[3:41:41.520 --> 3:41:45.360]  know they got a dumbed-down military now i hear you i'm glad you're bringing up
[3:41:45.360 --> 3:41:48.560]  the martial law angle your take on the uh bailout
[3:41:48.560 --> 3:41:52.240]  i just think it's a big shift of wealth from the uh from the have not to the
[3:41:52.240 --> 3:41:55.360]  haves no that's it protecting them and fully
[3:41:55.360 --> 3:41:58.800]  imploding our economy as the dr paul card robert said earlier and he should
[3:41:58.800 --> 3:42:01.520]  run the treasury department folks wall street journal editor too
[3:42:01.520 --> 3:42:04.480]  uh friend philly you're on the air i can't believe the guess we get for the
[3:42:04.480 --> 3:42:08.800]  show it's a good radio show man uh friend philly
[3:42:08.800 --> 3:42:12.400]  go ahead yeah uh could you explain to me
[3:42:12.400 --> 3:42:17.840]  uh the net worth of aig and basically my theory might be
[3:42:17.840 --> 3:42:21.920]  that aig was so heavily involved with paying off
[3:42:21.920 --> 3:42:25.840]  or paying uh under certain circumstances defaulted
[3:42:25.840 --> 3:42:29.920]  uh securities uh did did a lot of these folks
[3:42:29.920 --> 3:42:34.080]  uh already got paid at the first time no that happened
[3:42:34.080 --> 3:42:37.600]  that's why they get to keep it all secret non-reviewable here you
[3:42:37.600 --> 3:42:40.960]  and uh they're allowed to pay whatever they want even over market value to
[3:42:40.960 --> 3:42:45.040]  themselves it is 700 plus billion paid directly to the bankers and
[3:42:45.040 --> 3:42:48.240]  engineered at all a huge bank robbery no but i mean it didn't didn't
[3:42:48.240 --> 3:42:52.880]  it didn't the treasury also uh bailout aig with it with a
[3:42:52.880 --> 3:42:56.720]  down payment of two of uh 200 billion something yes
[3:42:56.720 --> 3:43:01.360]  yes and they're going to continue uh those payments right that's it it's all
[3:43:01.360 --> 3:43:03.840]  about this look they're bringing the currency down they're bringing the
[3:43:03.840 --> 3:43:07.120]  country down they're just pouring it out just just
[3:43:07.120 --> 3:43:11.280]  again a picture of the u.s is a big mansion full of beautiful paintings and
[3:43:11.280 --> 3:43:15.760]  furniture and marble and and gold inlaid the chandeliers
[3:43:15.760 --> 3:43:19.360]  they've stolen the plasma tv's the jewels the furniture
[3:43:19.360 --> 3:43:22.000]  the and then they ripped out the wallpaper and they ripped out the
[3:43:22.000 --> 3:43:25.600]  sinks the marble sinks and they now they're tearing out the rafters and
[3:43:25.600 --> 3:43:28.800]  pulling down the pillars and and they and now they're they're
[3:43:28.800 --> 3:43:32.080]  grinding up the cement foundation to put it in i mean they are just stealing it
[3:43:32.080 --> 3:43:34.560]  all sir yeah if you don't like it a swat team will
[3:43:34.560 --> 3:43:37.760]  drop by and blow your head off all right i appreciate your call and i mean
[3:43:37.760 --> 3:43:41.840]  that's what it comes down to just like the the the sheriff in um
[3:43:41.840 --> 3:43:45.360]  rourke county or what's the name of the county that was that um
[3:43:45.360 --> 3:43:48.800]  that you'll find that clip john from three years ago i wanted to play

[3:46:15.020 --> 3:46:19.060]  robert california on the air
[3:46:19.060 --> 3:46:20.360]  um...
[3:46:20.360 --> 3:46:24.040]  it shows again that we shouldn't take down the names of everybody voted yes
[3:46:24.040 --> 3:46:25.380]  on this thing
[3:46:25.380 --> 3:46:30.200]  and really look into their financial statements and see who and who bought
[3:46:30.200 --> 3:46:31.920]  and paid for
[3:46:31.920 --> 3:46:35.160]  on the other thing is that uh... joel was a little right that it's not
[3:46:35.160 --> 3:46:38.520]  necessarily that you should run for offices that we all should run for
[3:46:38.520 --> 3:46:39.320]  office
[3:46:39.320 --> 3:46:43.100]  or at least at those people who are good in their in our
[3:46:43.100 --> 3:46:46.580]  uh... neighborhoods that are running for office that we should get out there
[3:46:46.580 --> 3:46:49.540]  and for them i agree we should run to expose election for all that see the
[3:46:49.540 --> 3:46:52.940]  globalist preemptively took over most of the voting systems now about forty
[3:46:52.940 --> 3:46:55.620]  percent of the swing and any major national move
[3:46:55.620 --> 3:46:58.780]  so that this so that they block us there we have to have signed
[3:46:58.780 --> 3:47:00.340]  petitions
[3:47:00.340 --> 3:47:01.700]  to remove
[3:47:01.700 --> 3:47:05.840]  nationwide yet have a paper ballot removal of the electronic machines
[3:47:05.840 --> 3:47:09.660]  yeah i understand that but also there's smaller elections where we have the base
[3:47:09.660 --> 3:47:10.620]  of power
[3:47:10.620 --> 3:47:14.260]  in a lot of areas that don't take money and they're not really read because
[3:47:14.260 --> 3:47:16.660]  they can't read all
[3:47:16.660 --> 3:47:19.180]  i hear you not really we need to swarm them

[3:54:55.660 --> 3:55:02.660]  I remember five minutes of worldwide transmission live
[3:55:02.660 --> 3:55:31.660]  and my sweetest friend, everyone I know, everyone I know goes away in the air and you could have it all the empire of dirt, my empire of dirt, I will let you in, I will let you down
[3:55:31.660 --> 3:55:38.660]  I will let you down
[3:55:38.660 --> 3:55:44.660]  yeah, the empire of dirt, the paper money they used to take over the U.S. and the world, coming down
[3:55:44.660 --> 3:55:49.660]  Ted Anderson, finish up with those coins and I'm going to get your take on what just happened with the banker takeover
[3:55:49.660 --> 3:55:57.660]  yeah, sure, I'll be happy to go with it, I mean, you asked me a question going on at the end of the break about why is the gold chip to Europe in that time
[3:55:57.660 --> 3:56:07.660]  when one FDR confiscated gold in 1933, they set up a new standard that allowed foreigners, foreign banks to exchange their currency back U.S. currency for gold still
[3:56:07.660 --> 3:56:16.660]  but the U.S. citizens couldn't, as they devaluated their currency and gold began to rise, it got up above thirty three dollars an ounce which was the standard at that time
[3:56:16.660 --> 3:56:25.660]  and so people started in foreign nations, started, you know, requesting gold over paper currency, in addition to that, when we bailed off all those European countries
[3:56:25.660 --> 3:56:30.660]  after World War II, the destruction, we sent a lot of gold over there then, too, because nobody trusted you
[3:56:30.660 --> 3:56:36.660]  absolutely, and you're one of the biggest and best dealers out there, so you've been able to get a lot of stuff that people can't get any more quickly
[3:56:36.660 --> 3:56:37.660]  tell them the coins
[3:56:37.660 --> 3:56:46.660]  yeah, I'll go with the right now, we have British sovereigns, currently they're at 234, we have Franks at 190 and I'm not kidding you, there are none in the United States to buy
[3:56:46.660 --> 3:56:53.660]  and then we also have the Franklin half, which is, you know, a fabulous silver coin and you've got a bunch of them
[3:56:53.660 --> 3:57:00.660]  we have ten bags, I mean, that's limited, obviously, but really definitely something that you should get into at this time
[3:57:00.660 --> 3:57:02.660]  I guess ten bags isn't a lot for me, it sounds like a lot, you know, I'm thinking of them
[3:57:02.660 --> 3:57:11.660]  well, ten bags at a thousand dollars per face, which means there's twenty thousand coins, that's not an awful lot, and it's eight dollars and seventy cents a piece
[3:57:11.660 --> 3:57:19.660]  one eight hundred, six eight six, two two three seven, eight hundred, six eight six, two two three seven, and so I guess when those are gone, they're gone
[3:57:19.660 --> 3:57:25.660]  that goes into the night, into the weekend, the brokers will be there all weekend, one eight hundred, six eight six, two two three seven
[3:57:25.660 --> 3:57:33.660]  and Ted just does these incredible offers, folks, by buying low, so he can sell, you know, to you when it's high, but I mean, he's buying these right at what they are
[3:57:33.660 --> 3:57:39.660]  and basically just getting them out the door, so he can, you know, introduce you to being the customers and in the precious metals with all that's happening
[3:57:39.660 --> 3:57:46.660]  they've signaled they're going to kill the dollar, they are going to kill us with inflation, move into metals now, they may even try to come after them later
[3:57:46.660 --> 3:57:57.660]  but that's after they've already got your bank money, so this is another stopgap measure, a hedge against inflation, an emergency purse, one eight hundred, six eight six, two two three seven
[3:57:57.660 --> 3:58:06.660]  got those, you know, great half dollars in silver, gorgeous, you've got the gold, that's very collectible because you can't even get them right now
[3:58:06.660 --> 3:58:12.660]  eight hundred, six eight six, two two three seven, great deals on that, Ted, thanks for coming on, what do you think of the bailout?
[3:58:12.660 --> 3:58:19.660]  oh, you know, it's the worst case scenario that could have ever come across to the United States citizens, we are in big trouble financially
[3:58:19.660 --> 3:58:22.660]  and it's only the beginning, Ted, I'll talk to you after the show, God bless you
[3:58:22.660 --> 3:58:23.660]  yep, thanks, Alex
[3:58:23.660 --> 3:58:30.660]  you bet, ladies and gentlemen, one of the most or the most powerful transmissions I've ever done, jam-packed, breaking down what's really happening
[3:58:30.660 --> 3:58:36.660]  and martial law in the house, them being forced to vote on this under threat of martial law and quote, blood in the streets
