[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:31.000 --> 00:35.000]  Now we see the earth. You got it.
[00:36.000 --> 00:39.000]  Now we see the earth.
[00:39.000 --> 01:01.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Sunday, the 15th day of July 2012, and in the first hour, we're going to look at the United Nations Treaty.
[01:01.000 --> 01:13.000]  The United Nations Treaty that President Obama says he's planning to sign and that they plan to try to implement,
[01:14.000 --> 01:20.000]  even if Congress does not ratify it. People say, hey, that's the UN. What they do doesn't matter to us.
[01:20.000 --> 01:30.000]  Really, we've had the Congress basically lay down the fact that they've been told that the UN and NATO gives our military orders.
[01:31.000 --> 01:38.000]  And if you missed that clip, they've done it twice to the House and Senate Armed Services Committee in the last five months.
[01:38.000 --> 01:50.000]  First time five months ago, last time three months ago, and of course last year with the Libya bombardment, Obama in letters he sent to Congress said, you are not involved. Sit down and shut up.
[01:50.000 --> 02:09.000]  We've got at least four of the five Supreme Court justices who have been coming out and saying that they take their orders from the UN and that we should follow UN law.
[02:09.000 --> 02:24.000]  So I want to talk some about the United Nations today, not just about this treaty, and we're going to be going over all of that.
[02:25.000 --> 02:36.000]  But even Forbes, in articles that have been put out, has had to admit that this will at their minimum put the UN over gun registration here in the United States.
[02:36.000 --> 02:50.000]  Then I want to get into the proliferation of drones, because now people are finally paying attention to this, because it's going to be drone taxis, drone cars, drone submarines, drone ships, drone aircraft, drone spacecraft.
[02:51.000 --> 03:02.000]  It already is, and they're going to come out, the system's already saying this, I told you this a decade ago, and say humans aren't safe, humans are bad, and make you drive a robot car.
[03:02.000 --> 03:09.000]  At first they'll just be a lot higher insurance if you want to drive yourself, but over time they are going to end up restricting it.
[03:10.000 --> 03:22.000]  This is how the nanny state operates, this is how the nanny state mentality works, so I'm going to talk about the rise of the robot technocracy in the second half of the second hour.
[03:23.000 --> 03:24.000]  So about an hour and a half from now.
[03:25.000 --> 03:30.000]  When we come back, I'm going to also give the number out for your take, your view on the United Nations treaty.
[03:30.000 --> 03:42.000]  Guys, I meant to have the Forbes article, where it broke down the sections, because I have the sections, I have Aaron's breakdown of it, and then fullwars.com, but there's another article.
[03:43.000 --> 03:47.000]  It's the one that's actually linked right there, it's the first link in that article.
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  That's the one I want, not this one.
[03:52.000 --> 03:53.000]  There you go.
[03:53.000 --> 03:57.000]  Print that one for me.
[03:58.000 --> 04:06.000]  That's the one where even Forbes analysis with their lawyers says it will have the UN register guns, and it's got little statements in there, and Aaron Dykes has got it in his video.
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  I'm going to have Aaron, we produced the videos this week, posted them yesterday.
[04:12.000 --> 04:20.000]  I'm going to have him repost them as red links by analysis, his analysis up at the top of him, fullwars.com, as it's already scrolled off into the featured news archive.
[04:20.000 --> 04:23.000]  That little buddy link featured news archive is so important.
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.000]  There's also the top stories link at the top, and the red link breaking news.
[04:28.000 --> 04:30.000]  Those are both key links at infowars.com to click.
[04:31.000 --> 04:35.000]  So we're going to be going over all of that, and a lot of other financial news.
[04:36.000 --> 04:46.000]  It really hit me like a ton of bricks as well this morning when I saw the red dirt report that I'm going to get Aaron to post with John DeKamp, who we've had on many times from the Franklin cover-up.
[04:46.000 --> 04:52.000]  I forgot about 10 years ago on my show, he started getting into Penn State because he'd never been proven in court.
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.000]  I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, let's not go there.
[04:56.000 --> 04:57.000]  I'd forgotten about that, but he called it.
[04:57.000 --> 05:16.000]  Sick of the globalist eugenesis control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die? Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[05:16.000 --> 05:26.000]  Its filters are silver and pregnant to prevent bacterial growth. There's no priming required. It's NSF 42 certified. Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[05:27.000 --> 05:32.000]  Easy to set up and use. Doesn't require electricity. Purify water from lake streams, ponds and wells.
[05:33.000 --> 05:40.000]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key. Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[05:40.000 --> 05:47.000]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there. It's what my family uses. Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[05:48.000 --> 05:53.000]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[05:54.000 --> 05:58.000]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[05:58.000 --> 06:13.000]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[06:13.000 --> 06:29.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:44.000 --> 06:58.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Sunday, and we are broadcasting worldwide on this 15th day of July 2012.
[06:58.000 --> 07:12.000]  And the first video I want to go to here today is a short clip from ABC News. But there are more than 20 of these clips online from PBS, CBS, NBC, CNN.
[07:13.000 --> 07:20.000]  Just type in gun confiscation Katrina. And there's documentaries online by the NRA.
[07:20.000 --> 07:30.000]  We're all over the state. The feds led by the Army would show up in high and dry areas and take people's firearms in rural areas. You name it.
[07:31.000 --> 07:45.000]  And the reason I'm going to go to this video here in just a few minutes is because Obama had 50-plus senators send him a letter last year.
[07:45.000 --> 07:55.000]  Over 100 members of the House of Representatives as well saying, do not sign the UN Small Arms Ban Treaty. Do not sign it.
[07:56.000 --> 08:09.000]  And Obama has said he is going to sign it, but worse than that, he has said that he intends to try to implement it outside of congressional approval.
[08:09.000 --> 08:19.000]  And we see this over and over and over again where Congress won't pass the global Kyoto carbon tax.
[08:20.000 --> 08:26.000]  And so Obama implements it and shuts down power plants not owned by General Electric, gives them a waiver.
[08:27.000 --> 08:32.000]  We see this over and over and over again.
[08:32.000 --> 08:52.000]  Now, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, even Forbes in its analysis, even mainline establishment Forbes says you in agreement should have all American gun owners up in arms.
[08:52.000 --> 09:02.000]  It may not come as a surprise news to many of you. The United Nations doesn't approve of your Second Amendment. Not one bit.
[09:03.000 --> 09:12.000]  And they very much hope to do something about it with help from some powerful American friends under the guise of a proposed Global Small Arms Treaty premised to fight terrorism insurgency.
[09:12.000 --> 09:22.000]  That means resisting tyrannical government and international crime syndicates, you mean like the ones the big megabanks run.
[09:23.000 --> 09:26.000]  And what exactly does that intended agreement entail?
[09:27.000 --> 09:34.000]  Globally, nations agree to enact tougher licensing requirements, creating additional bureaucratic red tape for legal firearms owners.
[09:34.000 --> 09:42.000]  Well, yeah, what's the UN involved in our laws for? Confiscate and destroy all unauthorized civilian firearms, exempting those owned by government, of course.
[09:43.000 --> 09:46.000]  Ban the trade, sell and provide ownership of all semi-automatic weapons. It states this.
[09:47.000 --> 09:52.000]  Create an international gun registry, clearly setting the stage for full-scale gun confiscation.
[09:53.000 --> 09:55.000]  In short, overriding our national sovereignty. It goes on.
[09:55.000 --> 10:03.000]  Now, here's the deal. They've added a line in there now, and Aaron Dykes has this in his big report on this.
[10:04.000 --> 10:09.000]  Emergency alert, UN set to ban civilian gun ownership, red link to the top of MFullWars.com right now.
[10:10.000 --> 10:18.000]  Where they say that this will not abridge any domestic laws.
[10:18.000 --> 10:27.000]  But it goes on to state that the countries agree to implement what the UN policies are.
[10:28.000 --> 10:33.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, if you read the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, there's 30 articles in it.
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.000]  And when you get up to the last two articles, there's all these wonderful rights in there.
[10:39.000 --> 10:44.000]  Basically a right to somebody else's money, a right to communism, a right to socialism.
[10:44.000 --> 10:48.000]  All these great rights, a free lunch basically, which the UN never gives you.
[10:49.000 --> 10:53.000]  But the last two parts, you can look this up for yourself.
[10:54.000 --> 10:58.000]  I mean, take notes, ladies and gentlemen, says this is the big UN charter on human rights.
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.000]  Their big official law that it's all based on. Freedom and all that jazz they claim.
[11:03.000 --> 11:07.000]  Or Stalin claimed it was all about freedom. So did Hitler, so did Mao, so did every other thug.
[11:07.000 --> 11:14.000]  And it says right there that if something goes against the UN, it's null and void.
[11:15.000 --> 11:19.000]  Or if the United Nations says so at any time, any of these rights are null and void.
[11:20.000 --> 11:25.000]  So it's kind of like a contract that says you get all these great things, but we can take it away anytime we want.
[11:26.000 --> 11:30.000]  It's not inalienable. It's not unalienable. It's not in concrete.
[11:31.000 --> 11:34.000]  Now, before I get into all this, I just want to say something here.
[11:34.000 --> 11:37.000]  And later in the week, I'm going to have a whole report.
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  We're going to produce this week. We'll probably be ready by Friday.
[11:41.000 --> 11:46.000]  We've only got a few weeks on this, so Obama's saying he may sign it next month.
[11:50.000 --> 11:55.000]  We're going to produce a report going back over all the gun confiscation, the hundreds of countries that registered guns,
[11:56.000 --> 12:01.000]  then always ban them, then engage in mass murder, the UN going into Rwanda and other areas,
[12:01.000 --> 12:06.000]  and registering, then confiscating guns of one group and then having the other group exterminate them as the UN helped.
[12:07.000 --> 12:14.000]  And the UN, even in the New York Times last year admittedly, murdering people for their property in Uganda and Honduras.
[12:15.000 --> 12:23.000]  I mean, look it up. The UN is a murder force, but they have PR ads and little kids with tin cans for UNICEF and fancy PR.
[12:23.000 --> 12:33.000]  But the Soviets, when they poured into your country, had similar PR showing the Soviet there to help you, but that's not what happened.
[12:34.000 --> 12:38.000]  But all of that aside, we're going to have the quotes.
[12:39.000 --> 12:45.000]  You can look them up in Supreme Court justices saying four of the current sitting have said we should be under UN law
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.000]  and that they are going to start ruling according to UN law, that that's going to be their precedent.
[12:50.000 --> 12:54.000]  I mean, this is some scary stuff, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:55.000 --> 13:01.000]  Who created the UN? A bunch of mega bankers, robber barons who were anti-free market monopoly men,
[13:02.000 --> 13:05.000]  Rockefellers, Rothschilds, Carnegie's. Look it up.
[13:06.000 --> 13:11.000]  They bragged it would be this consortium they set up to have countries shine over their rights to.
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.000]  It's a criminal murder gang.
[13:14.000 --> 13:21.000]  It's a joke how incredibly evil it is and the atrocities committed by the UN armies all over the world.
[13:22.000 --> 13:32.000]  Look it up. I mean, they are known as the most vicious, disgusting, murderous, child kidnapping, sex trade, white slavery, mass murder crew you could imagine.
[13:33.000 --> 13:36.000]  The UN is so corrupt it will blow your mind. They've got diplomatic immunity.
[13:36.000 --> 13:43.000]  They engage in narcotics trafficking, money for oil, back room scams, but I'm digressing.
[13:44.000 --> 13:47.000]  Just type into a search engine and you'll see his speeches.
[13:48.000 --> 13:52.000]  I can play the clip here right now, but I never have time to be on the radio where the attorney general met with the TV heads
[13:53.000 --> 13:56.000]  and said we need to brainwash the public to be anti-gun, anti-second amendment.
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.000]  Just type in attorney general, Holder says brainwash people against guns. You'll see the video clip.
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.000]  Don't have time to play them all. We may though actually cue that up. I can't help it.
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  I'll just never get to calls if I do this.
[14:10.000 --> 14:15.000]  He wrote as deputy attorney general that he wants all civilian guns banned.
[14:16.000 --> 14:26.000]  The UN said in their Unideer UN Treaty version July 7th ratified at the UN in New York City where the Rockefeller properties base where they gave them the land.
[14:26.000 --> 14:38.000]  In 2001 July 7th quote, civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.000]  Look it up. We're going to put a whole special report together for you.
[14:43.000 --> 14:46.000]  We've got one coming up that Aaron did, but it just gets into the current rhetoric of the UN.
[14:47.000 --> 14:51.000]  We're going to go deep on this. Holder says ban your guns.
[14:51.000 --> 14:56.000]  Obama as a state senator said ban guns completely and here's the big one.
[14:57.000 --> 15:04.000]  Anywhere they're in control, Chicago, New York and other globalist mafia controlled big city crime syndicates.
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.000]  Is there a second amendment? No, zero, zero, zero.
[15:10.000 --> 15:16.000]  All the rich billionaires have got details of 10, 20 guys with submachine guns specially licensed by the city.
[15:16.000 --> 15:25.000]  In New York with more than 10 million people, there's less than a thousand gun permits issued and it's all to bodyguards for billionaires.
[15:26.000 --> 15:30.000]  Oh, guess who gets one in San Francisco? Guess who gets one when she's in New York?
[15:31.000 --> 15:37.000]  Diane Feinstein and Barbara Boxer both get special permits for semi-autos.
[15:38.000 --> 15:42.000]  Again, they have guns. You don't. They live behind armored walls. You don't.
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.000]  And then you die in Chicago as the criminals don't fall along.
[15:46.000 --> 15:55.000]  The point is these people have all said, Sarah Brady has said, on the floor of the house in 93, they want a total gun ban, total gun ban.
[15:55.000 --> 16:12.000]  That's what they want. That's what they want.
[16:25.000 --> 16:34.000]  The survival seed vaults were less than one of theirs. The survival seed vault from mypatriotsupply.com includes detailed planting and seed saving instructions and ships same day.

[19:00.000 --> 19:03.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[19:03.000 --> 19:07.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[19:08.000 --> 19:13.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[19:14.000 --> 19:19.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[19:20.000 --> 19:27.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[19:27.000 --> 19:34.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[19:35.000 --> 19:39.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[19:40.000 --> 19:44.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[19:45.000 --> 19:50.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[19:50.000 --> 19:59.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[20:00.000 --> 20:08.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[20:11.000 --> 20:15.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[20:15.000 --> 20:20.000]  In the heart of the resistance, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:31.000 --> 20:40.000]  Alright, let me explain why this is happening as well, because when I produce this whole piece that we're going to air probably Friday, maybe next Sunday here.
[20:40.000 --> 20:44.000]  We've got one produce report coming up that Aaron Dykes did this week.
[20:45.000 --> 20:53.000]  There's another report I did yesterday that breaks a lot of it down up at infowaters.com with all the links, all the proof of what we're saying.
[20:54.000 --> 20:56.000]  But the United Nations, do you know its history?
[20:57.000 --> 21:02.000]  The British Empire was having trouble getting kicked out of countries in 1918 or so.
[21:03.000 --> 21:05.000]  Their empire was starting to collapse.
[21:05.000 --> 21:13.000]  And so on record, what they did was, they worked with the Council on Fine Relations that they'd established here in the U.S.
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.000]  I mean, they all write books about this. This is not a secret.
[21:17.000 --> 21:21.000]  Cheryl Quigley wrote Tragedy and Hope, Bill Clinton's mentor at Georgetown.
[21:22.000 --> 21:26.000]  We sell the 1400-page book at infowaters.com, if you care to see it, or infowarshop.com.
[21:27.000 --> 21:31.000]  How they established this global government, but they wanted nations to think they were part of it.
[21:31.000 --> 21:35.000]  So the League of Nations failed because the U.S. wouldn't join it.
[21:36.000 --> 21:40.000]  So the globalists said, well, we'll just fund a dictator like Hitler. Lord Milner did.
[21:41.000 --> 21:44.000]  He said, we'll find some dictator. He said that in the 20s. Those documents are public.
[21:45.000 --> 21:49.000]  We'll have them wreck Europe. They didn't run Hitler. They funded him.
[21:50.000 --> 21:54.000]  Told him to go ahead and invade, had a treaty with England that they were going to back him up.
[21:54.000 --> 22:00.000]  That's what the deputy Führer Rudolph Hess flew over to Germany and parachuted out with that treaty to the royal grounds.
[22:01.000 --> 22:05.000]  They arrested him and threw him in the tower. That's why Hitler, at first, wouldn't bomb England.
[22:06.000 --> 22:09.000]  England actually had to bomb Germany first before they did that because he thought he had a treaty.
[22:10.000 --> 22:13.000]  He was going to make the king of England, the supreme ruler.
[22:14.000 --> 22:17.000]  Over England, he was a big Nazi. But again, you're not taught this in school, folks.
[22:18.000 --> 22:19.000]  Sad issue, though.
[22:19.000 --> 22:24.000]  The same bankers set up Stalin because they wanted to play the two off against each other.
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  Well, actually, they set up Lenin before that. Just look this up.
[22:28.000 --> 22:33.000]  J.P. Morgan funded Lenin.
[22:34.000 --> 22:37.000]  The British government sent over 50 million as well.
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  Just look up Lenin's train of gold.
[22:40.000 --> 22:51.000]  It was tens of thousands of folks from the United States were sent as the paramilitary siege brigades out of Brooklyn, New York, and other areas to overthrow the white Russians.
[22:52.000 --> 22:56.000]  Folks, that doesn't mean they had white skin. They meant that they were pro-Zar.
[22:57.000 --> 23:02.000]  And our government really helped organize the overthrow of the Tsar and the installation of the Red Terror.
[23:03.000 --> 23:04.000]  This is all mainline history.
[23:04.000 --> 23:14.000]  But I digress again. Bring us up to 1945, end of World War II, Presidio military base in San Francisco.
[23:15.000 --> 23:17.000]  It's right underneath the Golden Gate Bridge. I've been there. You can go there.
[23:18.000 --> 23:21.000]  It's all Gorbachev UN Foundation's now a command base of evil against America.
[23:22.000 --> 23:31.000]  And the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds all pledged to put hundreds of millions of dollars of their money and then billions of U.S. taxpayer money into the UN.
[23:31.000 --> 23:35.000]  So that they could have trader politicians over time. And they all stated this.
[23:36.000 --> 23:40.000]  The CFR writes constant magazine articles. I mean, this is not, this is not hidden.
[23:41.000 --> 23:42.000]  They just think you're stupid.
[23:43.000 --> 23:50.000]  And so would have the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL and Nightline say you were crazy the last 50 years if you warned of the plan.
[23:51.000 --> 23:55.000]  Now they go on CNN, CNBC and announce we've been captured by foreign banks.
[23:56.000 --> 23:58.000]  World government is here. You're going to pay your taxes to them.
[23:58.000 --> 24:02.000]  They'll never be a recovery. The bankers own you. Do you want me to play those clips again?
[24:03.000 --> 24:08.000]  I actually have them, but side issue, you know, if you won't look it up, don't care about your own preservation.
[24:09.000 --> 24:13.000]  Fine. And you feel powerless. You're just going to ignore me and say it didn't true.
[24:14.000 --> 24:16.000]  This isn't the show for you. Okay. We're not rolling over here.
[24:17.000 --> 24:21.000]  We understand we can defeat this because it's so out in the open. It's so outrageous.
[24:21.000 --> 24:28.000]  It's so big. It's so wicked that if we just get the word out, doesn't take a majority to prevail against these tyrants,
[24:29.000 --> 24:33.000]  but a tireless, focused, informed, angry, motivated minority.
[24:34.000 --> 24:39.000]  We're fighting a minority of criminals that set this up. We, the people are going to defeat them.
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  Now continuing here, please look this up.
[24:43.000 --> 24:47.000]  The Republic couldn't fall from without. It can only fall from within.
[24:47.000 --> 24:55.000]  So the globalists have taken over the U S. They have uses as an engine to set up their global corporate government while getting us into debt to them,
[24:56.000 --> 25:05.000]  while letting us take the blame for what they've done so that other globalist arms can pose as the good guys and get other countries to join them in coalitions.
[25:06.000 --> 25:15.000]  Meanwhile, the banksters that issue the currency and credit through fraud through fractional reserve banking and now infinity lending via the fraudulent counterfeit instruments and derivatives.
[25:15.000 --> 25:26.000]  They've now leveraged that and they sit above the bricks, the Shanghai Cooperative, the Anglo-American, Europe, England, U.S., Canada, New Zealand, Australia power axis.
[25:27.000 --> 25:31.000]  The three trilateral arms all, by the way, Rockefeller wrote books on this.
[25:32.000 --> 25:39.000]  David Rockefeller, the trilateral commission founding documents from 1974 are public. That's how I knew the whole plan.
[25:40.000 --> 25:43.000]  I didn't just magically imagine all this and now it's magically happening.
[25:43.000 --> 25:52.000]  It's all laid out just like a program for a play. If you went to a play with three acts of William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar,
[25:53.000 --> 25:57.000]  and you have what's coming up next, honey, there's going to be the death of Caesar.
[25:58.000 --> 26:06.000]  And then the death of Caesar happens. They stab him to death in the Senate and my wife doesn't tug on my arm and go, baby, you're psychic.
[26:06.000 --> 26:16.000]  There's a program. There's a program. It's a program. It's a program. We're on a program and the program doesn't lead to a nice place.
[26:17.000 --> 26:25.000]  Now to make a long story short, the United States is taken over by the Federal Reserve in 1913.
[26:26.000 --> 26:29.000]  They only had a beachhead then. They expand their power, their control, leverage it.
[26:29.000 --> 26:37.000]  Emergency Powers Act 1933, bringing the government under emergency rule ever since then.
[26:38.000 --> 26:46.000]  1945, start implementing the income tax that they passed in 1913 to pay the offshore Federal Reserve as even the grace commission of Ronald Reagan found in 1981,
[26:47.000 --> 26:53.000]  not one red center, your income tax goes to pay for anything. It goes to the bankers who made it up all out of nothing like Bernie Madoff and Ken Lee.
[26:53.000 --> 27:02.000]  Now, these banksters worldwide, they don't want anyone to be armed to be able to resist them.
[27:03.000 --> 27:08.000]  When their mercenaries or their militaries go in, I mean, they think you're so stupid, folks.
[27:09.000 --> 27:14.000]  The State Department publicly funded the County 2012 video, which we exposed first. Now it's admitted.
[27:14.000 --> 27:22.000]  They publicly funded a guy who hadn't been seen in five and a half years who controlled a few hundred square miles in northern Uganda.
[27:23.000 --> 27:30.000]  We predicted in the Obama deception three and a half years ago they would invade and use him as the invasion pretext because it's a playbook.
[27:31.000 --> 27:37.000]  It's a blueprint. It's a roadmap. I mean, it's a script. We know where they're going next and they get on the news and say, oh, that's right.
[27:37.000 --> 27:45.000]  And Bush went over there, George W. The U.S. military is invading almost every country over there calling humanitarian assistance.
[27:46.000 --> 27:52.000]  And the U.N. goes in and swatters the people and takes their property. I mean, villages burns them to the ground.
[27:53.000 --> 27:56.000]  And if you resist, they kill you. They're just taking the property everywhere.
[27:57.000 --> 28:02.000]  It is a mass extermination going on. And you tell the average yuppie that and they go good. They're getting Coney.
[28:02.000 --> 28:09.000]  They're freezing assets of individuals and stopping mobility all over Africa now in the name of Coney.
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.000]  They're doing it in countries 2000 miles away from Coney.
[28:15.000 --> 28:20.000]  Now, they don't want the Africans being able to get guns to defend themselves. Some are good. Some are bad.
[28:21.000 --> 28:24.000]  The point is they're not globalist. They don't want you having a gun.
[28:24.000 --> 28:34.000]  They don't want police departments. In fact, I've got big giant files from the L.A. Times you name it back in the 60s when they actually put this State Department plan out 7277.
[28:35.000 --> 28:40.000]  But guys, print me 7277. It's online too. I've forgotten more than I'll ever remember.
[28:41.000 --> 28:47.000]  And it shows even our local police after the takeover, they're going to be disarmed. And it's only going to be the U.N.
[28:47.000 --> 28:53.000]  Like in Hunger Games that come floating over you in the big drone and we're all down here with sticks and stones.
[28:53.000 --> 29:17.000]  I'm going to give you the master plan. It ties into the robot takeover.
[29:23.000 --> 29:30.000]  With your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[29:31.000 --> 29:39.000]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.

[33:20.000 --> 33:36.000]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. Central Time. That's 12 and 3 p.m. We're here live back Sunday's live. We're live right now.
[33:36.000 --> 33:49.000]  It is 4.33 and 40 seconds Central Standard Time. And I'm going to give the number out here in a moment. And then I'm going to play some video clips and go over some news.
[33:50.000 --> 33:55.000]  And then we're going to go to your phone calls on the subject of the United Nations Treaty on Small Arms.
[33:55.000 --> 34:09.000]  And then you read earlier versions of it and it says, for complete and total disarmament of the American people, no guns anywhere. And you look at where Mayor Bloomberg, he openly says no citizens should be able to have a gun.
[34:10.000 --> 34:19.000]  The ATF announced last year, in fact, folks won't believe this. Without side of law now, they just do rulemaking, shotguns to be banned. Guys, type that in.
[34:19.000 --> 34:29.000]  Public comment on ATF shotgun ban announcement. And you'll be at the ATF website, but also in newspapers. And it was such a backlash they backed off.
[34:30.000 --> 34:41.000]  Only because Congress said we will override you. You can't do that on your own. And they said 60 plus percent of shotguns made in the last decade would be banned because they could be modified to be non-sporting.
[34:41.000 --> 34:50.000]  Shotguns aren't for sport, folks, even though people use them for that. The Second Amendment is about defense against criminals on the street or of the Stalinistic type.
[34:51.000 --> 35:01.000]  Everyone knows that they've had university professors that came out at the media push that said that it wasn't about that. That guy lost his tenure at the University of Chicago.
[35:01.000 --> 35:11.000]  Remember that? I had that guy on and grilled him and said, you're a liar. We're going to expose your research. Folks went and ferried it out. His research, it was all made up. He lost his tenure.
[35:12.000 --> 35:27.000]  That's the kind of people we're dealing with. Hey, can you own a gun in Chicago? No. Can you own one in New York? No. Can you own one in London? No. Can you own one in Paris? No. Anywhere these people get in control.
[35:27.000 --> 35:37.000]  What's the UN have out front there building in New York? A 357 magnum, dirty Harry style, tied the knot. A civilian gun.
[35:38.000 --> 35:47.000]  Thank God I live in Texas and not New York City where you got to have five padlocks and the crime rates on average five times where it is where I live in Austin, Texas.
[35:47.000 --> 35:59.000]  Because you don't home invade around here because more than half the houses have got guns and you die if you do it. And again, everybody knows this. Everybody who's got a brain knows it.
[36:00.000 --> 36:10.000]  But you see the billboards put up the last 20 years by the Justice Department, saying report illegal guns. And what's it? You've seen the billboards all over the country. And what does it show? A revolver.
[36:10.000 --> 36:21.000]  So that when the carpet cleaners at your house who moved here from New York or whatever and thinks guns are illegal or on all these movies and TV shows, they say the Second Amendment basically not exist.
[36:22.000 --> 36:28.000]  All these cop shows. Oh, you got a gun. You're going to jail all based in New York. The carpet cleaner calls the cops on you.
[36:28.000 --> 36:39.000]  The guy freaked out, saw my gun case for even had kids in my house. I said, what's going on? He goes, oh, you got guns in here. I'm not going to. I said, that's a gun case. Men, those are shotguns and stuff.
[36:40.000 --> 36:49.000]  And he said, I can't do it and starts leaving. And I had a bad feeling and called the carpet cleaner place by an hour later and they said, we stopped him. We understand you're allowed to have guns, but they still acted weird like I was bad.
[36:49.000 --> 37:03.000]  I said, I'll never use you again, you lunatics. This is how they operate. This is the culture, the idea they've created. That's why people open carrying everywhere is freaking out the system because they want to have the idea that guns are illegal.
[37:04.000 --> 37:13.000]  I read articles all the time where people are trying to sell their house and the realtors call the cops when they see a gun case or reloading. Oh, that must be explosives.
[37:13.000 --> 37:19.000]  This is such a, you've got one half the country totally domesticated, cowardly dumbed down.
[37:20.000 --> 37:27.000]  And then you've got those of us that could still skin a buck run a trot line who are seen as the enemy. And we're alien to these people.
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  They think we're bad, ladies and gentlemen.
[37:32.000 --> 37:43.000]  They think we're bad. They think of a family's getting along and daddy's the head of the household that we're sick. They say this in their own textbooks.
[37:44.000 --> 37:51.000]  I've seen University of Texas textbooks where I live in Austin, Texas. I've shown them on air where they call the family a bygone era and a disease.
[37:52.000 --> 37:56.000]  Look it up. It's on a whole bunch of textbooks. You're like, well, that sounds crazy. Yeah, but they're in control.
[37:56.000 --> 38:01.000]  And by the way, I'm sick of calling these people liberals. They're not liberals.
[38:02.000 --> 38:06.000]  They're authoritarians posing as nanny state people that want to take care of you.
[38:07.000 --> 38:15.000]  What they want is to have you as their slaves. And let me stop right there before I get to these clips and Aaron Dyches report in the next segment on your calls.
[38:16.000 --> 38:17.000]  Freedom from war.
[38:17.000 --> 38:28.000]  The United States program for general and complete disarmament in the peaceful world U.S. Department of State. In fact, around here somewhere in our files, we have the original little blue State Department booklets.
[38:29.000 --> 38:41.000]  This is 1961. Just type in State Department Memorandum 7277 and they've got the diagrams. The full scans are online.
[38:41.000 --> 38:48.000]  This is from eat.edu. This is from what is that from Princeton?
[38:49.000 --> 38:59.000]  Go read this and it says the police will be armed. Hey cops, you think you're being given those tasers because it gives you something lower powered on the threat continuum.
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.000]  Read this. They're going to take your guns when they're done.
[39:03.000 --> 39:08.000]  And all you're going to have is a federalized brigade of troops and a local SWAT team that are under them.
[39:08.000 --> 39:16.000]  You notice under these national emergency agreements, the SWAT team and the emergency teams are already federal and already over at the threat fusion centers.
[39:17.000 --> 39:24.000]  In the future, the police aren't going to be able to have guns. Don't believe me? Go read 7277. Send off to the State Department for a booklet of it.
[39:25.000 --> 39:33.000]  This is what's in the Unideer document. This is what's in the UN treaty that I was just reading to you from Forbes.
[39:33.000 --> 39:41.000]  By the way, when they're done disarming the police, they've got graphics and they're showing the build down. That's why they called it build down in 61.
[39:42.000 --> 39:51.000]  You thought that term was new? The build down is once the UN NATO armies built. And guess who the UN Army is going to be? 1961, NATO.
[39:52.000 --> 39:59.000]  People like, oh, NATO will never be the world army. What do they call it now? The world army. Who does it command? Al Qaeda.
[39:59.000 --> 40:05.000]  Oh, you're a new listener. You didn't know NATO is commanding Al Qaeda in Libya, Syria and everywhere else. They use them against the Serbs.
[40:06.000 --> 40:14.000]  This is the real model. They use Al Qaeda to scare everybody to give it up their rights when we're really the target. Get sophisticated folks. Wake up.
[40:15.000 --> 40:19.000]  Here is the Attorney General. And this treaty, they could sign it the next month.
[40:19.000 --> 40:31.000]  Here is the Attorney General talking about how, this is on C-SPAN, how he met with TV heads to brainwash people to be anti-gun. Here it is.
[40:32.000 --> 40:38.000]  We just have to be repetitive about this. It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday.
[40:39.000 --> 40:45.000]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[40:45.000 --> 40:49.000]  Brainwash people into thinking about guns. Brainwash people.
[40:50.000 --> 40:56.000]  That's enough. The full clip song line is like a 30-minute C-SPAN clip and he goes on to say we've got to have anti-gun messages on TV everywhere.
[40:57.000 --> 41:10.000]  Not anti-criminals with guns. Anti-citizens. That's why cops move up the chain really fast. Ask any cop if they throw the book at a law-abiding citizen with their guns, catching them in some little thing.
[41:10.000 --> 41:20.000]  Let's go out to break with ABC News' gun confiscation Katrina. And remember, we have declassified Army training manuals for this year.
[41:21.000 --> 41:28.000]  Going back to 06 for gun confiscation. Look it up. Army manual for gun confiscation. Look it up. It's public.
[41:29.000 --> 41:33.000]  Not 29 palms, not a survey. They're training to take your guns in cordon cities.
[41:33.000 --> 41:43.000]  In the U.S. this is treason. Is the military bad? No. Those trying to use them as a weapon against our republic and our God-given rights that our forebearers fought hard for.
[41:44.000 --> 41:50.000]  That's treason. But take you out to break with the gun confiscation. We're going to come back. Remember this. High and dry homes. Here it is.
[41:51.000 --> 42:01.000]  That includes New Orleans where today authorities stepped up their efforts to empty the city. Bob Woodruff is there again tonight with an extraordinary human drama unfolding. Bob?
[42:01.000 --> 42:14.000]  That's true, Elizabeth. And good evening from New Orleans. Here the police and the National Guard find themselves in a very difficult position tonight to try to carry out an order to force people from the city without actually using force.
[42:15.000 --> 42:22.000]  Today in New Orleans, they got a lot tougher on the holdouts.
[42:22.000 --> 42:37.000]  We're going to come back. And this is how the Psyop works on all the newscasts. We're going to come back and play it. It's very informative. They say we don't use force and then it shows them grabbing people out of mansions, putting handcuffs on them, slamming them down and then stealing all their guns.
[42:38.000 --> 42:46.000]  And then they talk about killing Americans. The troops are like, yeah, you got to kill Americans. That's coming up. Regular big army.
[42:46.000 --> 42:56.000]  But, I mean, now it's public. The Secretary of the Army said two months ago in Council on Farm Relations, they're going to put brigades in every city to pull triggers on citizens.
[43:16.000 --> 43:27.000]  This includes 20 varieties of pure, hardy, easy to grow heirloom seeds. Yes, only $37.95. That's 70% less than our competitors. You could buy three survival seed vaults for less than one of theirs.

[44:59.000 --> 45:03.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[45:04.000 --> 45:08.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[45:09.000 --> 45:13.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[45:13.000 --> 45:19.000]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[45:20.000 --> 45:23.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[45:24.000 --> 45:27.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[45:28.000 --> 45:30.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[45:31.000 --> 45:34.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[45:35.000 --> 45:39.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[45:39.000 --> 45:44.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[45:45.000 --> 45:50.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[45:51.000 --> 45:58.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[45:58.000 --> 46:08.000]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Calben Soap Company.
[46:09.000 --> 46:12.000]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.

[47:16.000 --> 47:43.000]  All right, I'm going to continue ranting about this takeover here and then we're going to go to your calls in the next hour if you'd like to get queued up.
[47:43.000 --> 47:53.000]  We'd love to hear from you. The weekend number, it's different than the weekday number is 877-789-ALEX-877-789-ALEX.
[47:54.000 --> 47:58.000]  And there's this whole other dimension to this and that's what Aaron Dyches' report gets into at the end.
[47:59.000 --> 48:07.000]  Fast and Furious Staged to Pass UN Treaty is a key article that's been linked up at the top of infowars.com.
[48:07.000 --> 48:20.000]  There's a video report I filed on that. There's a detailed report that has all the clips, the documents, the statements by Aaron Dyches titled Emergency Alert UN Set to Ban Civilian Gun Ownership.
[48:21.000 --> 48:31.000]  Both of those are up on the site right now. Plus, Jews the preservation of firearms ownership, we've mirrored the great Aaron Zelman's research that I quite frankly think is conservative in the numbers.
[48:31.000 --> 48:38.000]  Of government killing over 260 million people, University of Hawaii confirms that number.
[48:39.000 --> 48:47.000]  Under demo side, after guns were registered and confiscated and in many of these massacres, it was the UN that did it.
[48:48.000 --> 48:56.000]  So go up to infowars.com in the featured news area, get those videos and those articles and email them out to everybody you know right now.
[48:56.000 --> 49:02.000]  You didn't think government takeover of healthcare would happen and there wasn't death panels in it. Now they admit it.
[49:03.000 --> 49:07.000]  They're going to phase it in over the next couple years. People didn't believe any of this would happen.
[49:08.000 --> 49:23.000]  People didn't believe when I told you two years ago Obama was shipping guns into Mexico and hand grenades to drug gangs so they could blame the Second Amendment and try to get a UN treaty passed so that Mexico could sue the U.S. at the UN over guns.
[49:23.000 --> 49:27.000]  By the way, you know they did that as part of that larger immigrant lawsuit.
[49:28.000 --> 49:36.000]  This is an international program to get us onto a treaty because the courts found that they didn't have any standing on executions, guns, any of it.
[49:37.000 --> 49:44.000]  So now when we sign this treaty, Mexico can go to the UN to try to force us to do something. See, this is what this is all about.
[49:44.000 --> 49:52.000]  And meanwhile the State Department's own memorandum which means it's U.S. policy 7277 that I just mentioned.
[49:53.000 --> 50:04.000]  State Department memorandum 7277. Notice I keep saying that. It's time to put down the remote miss a football game or whatever's on right now.
[50:04.000 --> 50:13.000]  What do they have in the middle of the summer? Baseball? It's time to put down the remote folks or it's all going out the window.
[50:14.000 --> 50:15.000]  You lose the liberty, you lose the prosperity.
[50:18.000 --> 50:26.000]  So let's finish up this report because when I reported for two weeks during Katrina they were confiscating guns with firefighters and witnesses that were there.
[50:26.000 --> 50:33.000]  People didn't believe it. They kept people from going into New Orleans and getting their mothers and people out of nursing homes and they died.
[50:34.000 --> 50:41.000]  Including the St. Bernard Parish sheriff was ordered by the feds not to save his mother and told the story on CBS News.
[50:42.000 --> 50:45.000]  Day one, yeah, mama, I'm coming to get you as soon as they let me. Day two, mama, I'm coming to get you.
[50:46.000 --> 50:52.000]  Day three, he starts crying. Her cell phone goes day five. He gets there six days later because the feds let him go to his mama.
[50:52.000 --> 50:58.000]  This is the sheriff in his county and she was dead in there with two feet of water up to her stretcher.
[50:59.000 --> 51:04.000]  Let me tell you, my mother is in a nursing home and some butt toothed fed. I mean, this is how pathetic we are.
[51:05.000 --> 51:13.000]  It's like it's North Korea. They said go out and cry for Kim Jong-il. We'd go out and do it. I mean, it's ridiculous what we've become as a country.
[51:13.000 --> 51:22.000]  And the feds wouldn't let people walk out. They blocked it. They use it as a siege development, as a siege drill of New Orleans.
[51:23.000 --> 51:31.000]  And why? Because it's what's in the Army manuals. We now have the Army manual they were using in 95, 96. We have the new manual.
[51:32.000 --> 51:39.000]  It's got gun confiscation in it. We covered that a week ago. The Army isn't even hiding this.
[51:39.000 --> 51:51.000]  Do you understand? We've got to say no to all this. The government is run by Chicago mafia that shipped guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment
[51:52.000 --> 51:57.000]  and got caught with the memos saying they were going to blame the Second Amendment and ban all semi-autos.
[51:58.000 --> 52:04.000]  That's a false flag stage terror attack, frame up, self-inflicted wound, inside job. You may have heard me talk about those.
[52:04.000 --> 52:09.000]  It's dirty government's favorite trick. That's why you never give up liberty for security.
[52:10.000 --> 52:19.000]  Because the minute you say you'll give up liberty and be a slave for security, those that want you to be a slave are going to start staging stuff to take your rights and pose as your savior.
[52:20.000 --> 52:23.000]  It is elementary, my dear Watson.
[52:23.000 --> 52:36.000]  And again, I just read to you from Forbes, not Alex Jones, even though we have our own detailed analysis.
[52:37.000 --> 52:44.000]  I just read to you where they admitted registration and banning of U.S. guns. That's what it really entails.
[52:45.000 --> 52:49.000]  And it's got the classic U.N. proviso that, oh, but we won't do this unless we want to get rid of it.
[52:49.000 --> 52:55.000]  How about the NDAA to secretly kill U.S. citizens, secretly torture disappearists? Obama first said he didn't want it.
[52:56.000 --> 52:59.000]  Then it turned out he wrote it. Then he said he wouldn't sign it. Then he did sign it.
[53:00.000 --> 53:04.000]  It turned out he demanded it be written because his, and notice Mitt Romney won't oppose him.
[53:05.000 --> 53:15.000]  You've got the Chicago gun-running mafia giving billions to energy companies and fraud, giving waivers to all their friends on health care and carbon taxes, open criminality at every level.
[53:15.000 --> 53:20.000]  Rahm Emanuel, all of this known filth, weatherman terrorist, all of it.
[53:21.000 --> 53:26.000]  Couldn't be more of a joke. The bankers have hired just a league of crooks to run their takeover.
[53:27.000 --> 53:33.000]  And the feds have got the central control. They're looting the treasury, bankrupting us, robbing us seven ways from Sunday.
[53:34.000 --> 53:40.000]  But we've still got guns and a basic culture of liberty. So these two things are existing in a paradox to each other.
[53:40.000 --> 53:53.000]  And Mitt Romney, who's certainly no angel and who I'm not supporting, you know, bank capital, he used to basically own and control, gave double the money to Obama they've given to him.
[53:54.000 --> 54:02.000]  When Obama comes out and calls him a criminal saying he still controlled bank capital when he left in 99, which is true to a certain extent.
[54:02.000 --> 54:09.000]  That's like saying Martha Stewart to prison for insider trading, but not, you know, Bernie Madoff or Ken Lay or something like that.
[54:10.000 --> 54:12.000]  And they're talking about how he's a crook.
[54:13.000 --> 54:19.000]  Meanwhile, Romney won't even hardly defend himself and won't even talk about fast and furious.
[54:20.000 --> 54:26.000]  And now says, well, the Supreme Court has ruled on health care. He's bought and paid for by the same people.
[54:26.000 --> 54:32.000]  And if they tell Mittens Romney to take a dive, he will. It's like a Don King boxing match.
[54:33.000 --> 54:43.000]  Now let me go to Katrina is remember the people running this government and the people running the UN have called for total civilian gun bans at nauseam.
[54:44.000 --> 54:46.000]  The quotes, the statements, the video clips, they're everywhere.
[54:46.000 --> 54:55.000]  And the first time they get a chance when a city's in trouble, they blockade from the hundreds of police departments and fire departments that wanted the Coast Guard wasn't allowed in.
[54:56.000 --> 55:00.000]  Walmart wasn't allowed in. Remember, and what they do, they ran into high and dry areas.
[55:01.000 --> 55:11.000]  Some of those houses look like $10 million houses. If you watch the video and took their guns, took their guns, took their guns, blew their safe doors and stole them.
[55:11.000 --> 55:15.000]  Listen to this ABC report. Here it is from where it was. Play it.
[55:19.000 --> 55:22.000]  Today in New Orleans, they got a lot tougher on the holdouts.
[55:23.000 --> 55:24.000]  Police Department in your home.
[55:25.000 --> 55:28.000]  Not only the flooded areas, but New Orleans driest and wealthiest neighborhoods too.
[55:30.000 --> 55:31.000]  Police Department.
[55:32.000 --> 55:37.000]  The police and National Guard going street by street, house to house.
[55:37.000 --> 55:43.000]  We need to make sure too that when we knock the doors, people usually need to make note, call it out.
[55:44.000 --> 55:48.000]  They say there are no orders to use force, just strong persuasion.
[55:49.000 --> 55:55.000]  Sometimes entering open houses with guns drawn and instructions to disarm anyone inside.
[55:56.000 --> 55:57.000]  You say guns will be taken.
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  No one will be able to be armed. We will take all weapons.
[56:00.000 --> 56:06.000]  That happened today in this wealthy neighborhood where homeowners had armed themselves to protect their mansions.
[56:07.000 --> 56:13.000]  Residents were handcuffed on the ground. In the end, police took their weapons but let them stay in their homes.
[56:14.000 --> 56:17.000]  They were a little bit threatened because our weapons were bigger than their weapons.
[56:18.000 --> 56:23.000]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[56:23.000 --> 56:31.000]  This guard unit occupied a church using it as a base camp. They had to leave a note because they could not get hold of the pastor to get permission.
[56:32.000 --> 56:37.000]  It is, it is surreal. You just never, you never expect to do this in your own country.
[56:38.000 --> 56:42.000]  Chris Montgomery says he'd rather be in Iraq than patrolling American neighborhoods.
[56:43.000 --> 56:47.000]  Walking up and down these streets, you don't, you don't want to think about the stuff that you're gonna have to do.
[56:48.000 --> 56:49.000]  Somebody pops around the corner.
[56:50.000 --> 56:51.000]  Let me shoot an American.
[56:51.000 --> 56:52.000]  Yeah.
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  Now let's talk about what was really going on there.
[56:56.000 --> 57:00.000]  The police department had their communications jammed by FEMA as the storm hit.
[57:01.000 --> 57:06.000]  There is evidence that some criminal elements did blow levies. I've been there to investigate it myself.
[57:07.000 --> 57:12.000]  It wasn't the first time the feds have blown the levies. They've done it before to protect the rich areas, back in the famous flood of the 20s.
[57:12.000 --> 57:20.000]  And then the other cops were busy robbing wall march and jewelry stores and homes and the military got into it as well.
[57:21.000 --> 57:27.000]  I've interviewed firefighters that were there. The military wasn't as bad as the police or the feds, but raping of women, robbing, looting.
[57:28.000 --> 57:35.000]  So that's what you can look for in an emergency is the feds kicking down your door and demanding sex with your wife if you want out of the city.
[57:35.000 --> 57:41.000]  And the sheriff sat there while his mother died and wouldn't come savor because the feds said so.
[57:42.000 --> 57:46.000]  Should have clapped them all in irons. These are the people that want your guns. Make no mistake.
[57:50.000 --> 57:55.000]  Let me ask you a question. What does freedom mean to you? The freedom to choose, the freedom to vote, the freedom to worship.
[57:56.000 --> 57:57.000]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?
[57:58.000 --> 58:03.000]  My friends, they eat foods direct or celebrating freedom this month while helping you take control of your greatest dependency food.

[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:07.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:13.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  We just joined as we're talking about the UN Treaty.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  We began registering and, of course, disarming the American people.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  In Katrina, we saw gun confiscation for up to 100 miles away from even New Orleans.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  They go into rural, high and dry areas and just rob everybody.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  The FBI leading the military.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  And I talked to a lot of people that were there from the Coast Guard and fire departments.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  And it was only the fire departments in Coast Guard that were not demanding sexual favors.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  Can you imagine with people that have had power off for days and needing to get out and you want to have sex with them?
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  I mean, I can't imagine trying to force it on somebody to begin with.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  I thought the whole point was that they were excited about it.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  I guess I'm just old-fashioned.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  But, I mean, in that type of situation.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  And then, by the way, it's hard to find, but it's the sheriff of that parish.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  We've had it before.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  I think it's something like Sheriff talks about FEMA sabotage.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  CBS News, it's a video.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  And he talks about it for five days.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  They wouldn't let him go get his mother out of the nursing home.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  And that's his county, his jurisdiction.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  I mean, my mother is stuck inside.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  I'm going to try to get there.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  And I'm sorry.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  Everybody tries to stop me.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  I'm going to have a big problem.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  It didn't matter.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  The police and military were all busy looting and stuff.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  I would have just taken a boat down the waterway.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  Somebody tried to stop me.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  I would say, hey, I'm going to get my mother.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  If they tried to stop me, of course, I'd be known as a terrorist.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  By the way, families tried to walk out on the highways.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  They would be a machine gun.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  We told you about that at the time.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  That was later confirmed.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  This is all that's going to happen during the disasters.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  They're going to come kill you.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  And people are running around.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  First, they were denying that our story was real that went nationwide
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  because of info wars.com and drudgerport.com.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  It was in CBS local news.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  The military flying around doing bug spraying in Florida with C-130s at about 150, 200 feet.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  And the Psyops hit the site and said we were lying.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  It wasn't true with links to CBS, the Air Force and the army admitting it.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  And then the Psyops was, well, the army can do a better job.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  The army isn't supposed to be running DWI checkpoints and JAWS a life and all this.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  And the army admits in the army times four years ago, it's a Psyop to acclimate people.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  The childlike brains of the general public.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  And then I get emails or not even emails.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  I read emails that come into other guys, but comments, things I see in their life.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  Alex, don't bash our military.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  The military itself has a lot of good people in it.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  I'm going to go to break and come back and go to Marty, Tommy, Bobby, Frank, CJ, Scott, George, Roger, Lloyds, Tim, Victor, James,
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  but have your point ready because I'm going to try to shut up and go to you.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  Then I've got Aaron Dyke's report.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  I'm going to play parts of an analyze here.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  My point is that's why the Germans did what they did because they kept saying, we'll support the military.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  Yeah, but I don't support Hitler and what he has them doing.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  Well, you better get behind the troops.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  Really, the troops would have been a better, a lot better off if that never would have happened.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  It's such a mindless argument that they use my support to troops.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  Really, they're not my troops.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  They work for the new world order now and most of the troops know that I'm sick of it.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  And look, this is a real takeover folks.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:46.000]  We got some bold criminals running things that have stolen more than $35 trillion out of the Treasury in the last five years.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  Bipartisan.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  This isn't about Mitt Romney, Barack Obama.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  When they say sit down Mitt Romney and take Obama calling you a criminal while he runs guns to Mexico and hangar dates and runs drugs into the country, you're going to do it.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  And you think Mitt Romney is going to save you.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  You know, there's this conventional wisdom of well, things will just move quicker under Obama wanted to move slower under Romney.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  How about they move quicker?
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  How about we get it all out in the open?
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  The globalists don't care.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  They've always hated America.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  They're spoiling for a fight with us.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  We've just got a hope that enough whistleblowers inside government and in media and everywhere start standing up and saying no.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  If we all start standing up and saying no, it will paralyze these criminals.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  It is a tiny little group of globalist criminals that are putting out false scripts and stories to push this whole thing.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  Now when we come back, we're going to go directly to your phone calls and a lot more.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  I'm going to get into why the globalists want to move everything to robots and drones.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  That takes humans out of the equation.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  That's coming up after your calls.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  Stay with us.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  T.V. We're streaming video.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000]  We're streaming video.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:07.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government coverups.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000]  You want answers?
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:36.000]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.000]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen. That's the great Dave Mustaine right there.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  Who knows? We might have Dave live in studio next Sunday.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  How's that sound?
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000]  I'll be the first in line.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  Then we're talking to one of the biggest country music legends of all time.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000]  I don't mean our good friend Willie Nelson.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  Somebody else of the same status.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000]  Who is a listener?
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  That's the great part about being able to get these folks on.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  We're lining up for the show.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000]  Very excited.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  And that looks like it could be later this week or next week.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  But all of that is a side issue.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  The good news is a lot of people are waking up to what's happening.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:24.000]  But only facing the true import, the true horror of our straights, of our position,
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000]  gives us any chance of stopping this.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  The very fact that I'm on over 115 AM and FM stations now.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  The very fact that this information is now so mainstream that I'm on XM for two plus years.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  One of their now, you know, top listen to channels.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  The fact that infowars.com and prismplotted.com are some of the top alternative dwarfing mainstream news sites.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  The only thing bigger is Drugs Report.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  And it's about four or five times bigger than InfoWars.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  And by the two sites, it's about three and a half times bigger.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000]  That's it.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000]  The dinosaur media is in trouble.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000]  There's a perfect storm of tyranny, though.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000]  The rats that took over society aren't just going to turn things over.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000]  They're going for broke.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000]  They've stolen tens of trillions.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000]  They want to convert this society to a tyranny.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  They want to put their detractors in prison.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000]  They want to take your guns.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000]  They want to inspect your house and farm.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  They want to rule you.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  They want authoritarianism.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  No one can deny we're plunging into tyranny.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  And it's bipartisan.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  Congress knows you're awake.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  They know that for five years they've had a 9% approval rating.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  They know you're buying 3, 4, 5 million guns a month.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  And a national questionnaire is saying it's because the government's evil.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  Their answer is to buy tanks and armored vehicles for you.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000]  But all we've got to do is go up to the military and police who are citizens as well
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  and say, this is treason.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  And it's checkmate.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  Everybody I talk to is just getting guns and getting ready.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  That is not the answer.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  The answer is info war.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  The answer is pointing out that this is an illegitimate out of control globalist takeover.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  Do I need to play CNBC saying we've been captured by foreign banks again
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  and admitting that we're quote, slaves to world government?
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  I played it like 20 times.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  Should I play it again?
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  I mean, because it's in hundreds of publications they're telling us this.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  They think we're idiots to the point they're throwing it in our face now.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  They tell Europeans you're now slaves to foreign banks.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  EU bureaucrats come in restaurants in Spain and other areas where they're already paying
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  over 70% in taxes in one way or the other.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  And say, we're going to every day have our people take 20% cash out of your cash register.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  That's where we're going here on top of all the taxes.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  It's just a mafia stick up.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  That's all it is.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  And of course they want your guns.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  In Rome 2000 years ago, you couldn't have a sword if you were a slave.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  500 years ago in Europe, you couldn't have a sword if you were a slave.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  300 years ago, you couldn't have a gun.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  It's elementary.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  All right, I'm going to shut up.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  Let's go to your calls.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  And again, Forbes, you in agreement should have us all gun owners up in arms goes on to say it'll register
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  and then begin banning our guns because that's what the treaty says.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  Despite what the lying MSNBC tells you, go read the treaty and read previous versions of it.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  And think about wherever they're in control, New York, Chicago, total gun ban.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  Bloomberg has said, Clinton has said, they've all said they want to ban our guns.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  They're abrading.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  And then they talk to you like you're an idiot and say, it's just reasonable restrictions.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  Marty in California, you're up first.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  Go ahead.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  Welcome, Marty.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  Okay, we have a phone system issue.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  All right, go ahead, Marty.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  Okay, buddy.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  Good, go ahead.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  Okay, I've seen you in a highlight back in February.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  Man, that was a great show.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  Oh, you saw me give a speech out in Florida?
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000]  Yeah, down at the highlight.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  Yeah.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  1,200 capacity crowd.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  Great people.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  Alex, I've been doing some research on that agenda 21.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  Yes, sir.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  Okay, one of the sections there is sustainable development, social equity.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  Now, I pressed that in and I came up with Central Florida Commuter Rail, which is financed by HUD.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  And it says anybody that takes any money from that opens themselves up to lose all their property rights.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  Yes.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  No, no, that's what the feds do.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  They bankrupt the economy, give you a little bit of somebody else's money, and then you wave your rights.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  But brother, I appreciate your call.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  Listen, I don't screen calls.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  I appreciate your call, but I told everybody here today, this is about the gun treaty.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  This is what we're talking about.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  So if you're not calling in about that, please, I'm not mad at you, but I don't even screen your calls.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  I said, look, they're going to try to sign this in the next mine.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  We got to talk about it.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  And it's part of UN agenda 21.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  Yes.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  The whole thing is communism in their words, but communism for us so we can't become successful.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000]  So we're dependent on government.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  The elites are offshore and exempt.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  It's like Mitt Romney didn't pay taxes.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  G doesn't pay taxes.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  They've written the laws.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  They're exempt.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  Then they have Warren Buffett, who's exempted himself.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  Come out and say raise money on the rich.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  We're exempt.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  And then they raise money on people making quarter million in a couple.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  That's not rich folks.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  That's middle class, upper middle class.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  Let's go to Tommy in Rochester, New York.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  Tommy, you're on the air.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  Go ahead.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  Good.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  What's your view on this treaty?
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  Well, we're in New York City if they remember, May of Dinkins.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  And back then when he was in office, he made the people, all in New York state, or, excuse me, New York City, register their firearms.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  Semi-automatics in particular.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  And they promised they'd never take them.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  And a few years later they took them all.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  Exactly.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  And that was the next step.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000]  As soon as he got done with dad, just like Adolf did, when everything got in,
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  the last guy registered his guns.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:22.240]  guns. Bam. There you go. Okay. So everybody who's listening, just keep that in mind, whether
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:26.760]  you live in New York state or not. That's what happened. And that's what will happen
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:32.360]  here. And Alex, I'd like to thank you so much for all that you do and thank God that you're
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:35.080]  here and I thank God every day that you're still with us.
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:39.400]  Well, God bless you, sir. Listen, please thank you. I appreciate your call. Folks, do not
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:44.400]  thank me anymore. I live here. I'm not going anywhere. There's no order run. I'm digging
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:49.960]  in. I've bought property in the country. I'm staying. We're in this together, folks. Please
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:53.840]  don't thank me because that implies that I'm doing something above and beyond the call.
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:59.880]  We have criminal authoritarians taking over. I mean, these are creepy bad people, folks.
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:03.520]  If you researched the weathermen that were funded by the big foundations who said they
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:10.520]  were going to put 100 million of us in reeducation centers and kill 25 mil, that came out in court.
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:15.480]  These are dangerous, wicked devils, man. We got to fight them. Bobby in California than
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:18.320]  Frank, CJ and others. Go ahead, Bobby.
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:23.080]  Everyone needs to go to M4 to get the emergency alert article and get it out to everybody
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:27.040]  they know. The one thing we have going for us right now is the Internet. And I support
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:31.320]  the majority of Ron Paul's views, excluding a stamp on tariffs, but a new campaign attacking
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:35.960]  net neutrality is the last thing we need right now to act like these providers are victims
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:40.120]  of coercive state action and to ignore the fact that we taxpayers paid for the billions
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:44.640]  and billions of subsidies. And right away, granted, this government gave these telcos
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:46.920]  and cable providers to build a network.
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:52.040]  Yeah, exactly. This is a very sophisticated issue. It's like Ron Paul saying, well, I've
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:56.000]  got to vote against GMO labeling because the feds don't have jurisdiction. This GMO is
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.880]  killing us, but I get their constitutional point. The issue is you've got to hamstring
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:05.600]  this now. I understand it feeds the monster. Then we build the infrastructure with tax
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:10.400]  money and our paychecks and then hand it over to globalist interest corporations that are
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:16.360]  as big as governments and operate like governments. That's where the extreme libertarian system
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:20.360]  breaks down because these court, a lot of these big globalist support libertarianism
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:24.120]  now because they've already transferred the wealth of themselves. Now they want to exempt
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:29.280]  themselves from the system they created and again, put us in the communism with them exempt
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:34.080]  above it. Oh no, we're going to have communism. They got to come on down in the slime with
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:39.560]  us. Is that what you're saying, brother? Yes, and this comes at a time when Verizon
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:43.600]  is claiming they have a right to edit what you see on there. That's what they're doing.
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:48.920]  I know, there's a total web takeover worldwide because governments are, the tyranny is rolling
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:52.760]  out. When the history books are written folks, this is going to be like World War II, but
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:56.840]  it's governments and corporations against the people. I mean, all hell is just now
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:58.080]  breaking loose.
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:04.520]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:09.320]  seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:13.160]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:16.640]  outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:21.200]  even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:27.400]  mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:32.000]  of nutrient dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part, these seeds have
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.120]  not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:43.520]  a full acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com,
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:54.880]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:17:01.200]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:05.360]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lunges Generator infuses the respiratory system
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:10.080]  with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:13.920]  of the Silver Lunges System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:19.400]  anywhere in or on the body. My name is Mario Safaldi, and I'm the developer of the Silver
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:24.080]  Lunges Generator. Not only does the Silver Lunges System produce endless colloidal and
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:29.720]  ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:35.680]  to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas. This includes the eyes,
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:42.240]  ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system. Be sure
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:49.320]  to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lunges System at www.silverlungs.com

[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:03.840]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:08.440]  as you get sick and die? Start purifying your water with ProPure. My friends, I've done

[01:19:55.720 --> 01:20:01.360]  order 888-253-3139.
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:22.880]  I'm gonna go right back to your phone calls dealing with the United Nations and Obama
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:27.280]  saying that they're gonna restrict our guns because they feel like it. And then when we
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:30.840]  actually look at the treaty and point out that it restricts things, they go, no it doesn't.
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:36.960]  We don't want your guns when the UN has stated, and our own State Department has stated in
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:42.840]  memorandum 7277, that they want the civilian abolition of guns completely. And then our
[01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:48.840]  military and police and that only a UN peacekeeper force, well we know what that means, a murder
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:55.360]  force with the whole world disarmed run by the bankers who got us into this mess running
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:21:00.760]  around doing what they want. It is absolutely nightmarish and now we have government run
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:05.040]  healthcare coming into our lives controlling the healthcare we get. Now they're saying,
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:10.320]  oh yeah, you won't get that preexisting condition covered. Oh yeah, we're gonna make you buy
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:14.560]  the healthcare and then cut the type of care you get. This is the model once they get you
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:18.520]  collectivized. Now government's telling you what you can eat, where you can live, what
[01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:24.600]  you can do, and they're just getting started. And it's the same system all over the world.
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:29.360]  But I'll tell you this, every time I go to a business meeting and park downtown and it's
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:35.080]  a valet, every one of them's a listener. Every time I meet neighbors, they're all listeners
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:39.120]  and their children are listeners and their neighbors are listeners and their cousins
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:45.960]  a listener. I was took my kids out fishing to the lake this weekend and I'm sitting
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:49.800]  there and there's people out there fishing in this group of people's listeners and those
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:53.920]  are listeners and these people are listeners, people are out of town are listeners and they're
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:58.080]  friends in California are listeners and those are listeners. The point is I'm not sitting
[01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:04.680]  there saying we have a lot of listeners. The point is we're winning the info war. But everybody's
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:09.080]  like I know it's bad. I know Romney's bad too. You know, what do we do? Thank God you're
[01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:13.680]  there. No, no, no, thank God you're there. Call them to talk radio, start a website,
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:19.440]  do YouTube videos, say no to corruption, go to city council, get in the face of bureaucrats,
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:24.440]  stand up to land grabbing. Call Congress and say we know your criminals and we know the
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:28.720]  US is in a global government receivership. Don't sit there and beg them for stuff. Just
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:36.040]  say look, we know your criminals and then people in media need to all stand up who've
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:40.160]  been controlled and are scared. Talk show host, you name it and I'm hearing it more
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:44.080]  and more. Look, they're hidden in a future if we don't beat these people. Have you figured
[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:51.680]  that out yet? There isn't a future if we don't beat these people. It's all coming down right
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:57.160]  now. Okay. I mean, the battle lines are being drawn and a lot of you think you're just going
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:02.120]  to sit it out and be safe folks. This is a fundamental transformation of civilization
[01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:08.000]  under agenda 21, which is a eugenics based system. And if you don't know what that is
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:15.160]  eugenics and agenda 21, it's the global government system and law. It's what you live under.
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:21.440]  We're now under this. They're just mopping up the free speech, mopping up what's left.
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:26.040]  And there's a lot to mop up by the way. Again, they're in control of the central government
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:29.400]  of every major country. They're looting them. They're wrecking them. They're engaged in
[01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:35.880]  every crime you can imagine getting away with it as well. But it's a paradox where they're
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:39.400]  getting away with it, but they're losing their viewers. They're losing their support. They're
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:43.600]  losing their credibility and the global bankers just hope they'll put in new politicians and
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:48.000]  you're up in the US and you'll go, oh, and you'll think things have changed. People are
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:54.920]  looking past that now to the point of where CNN and MSNBC have to admit we've been captured
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:24:00.880]  by a world government, foreign bankers. But then they spin it like, well, they do control
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:03.240]  us, so we better do what they say.
[01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:07.560]  It's like aliens sat down on the Washington Monument and said, we have come from the planet
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:13.840]  pop card. We are your rulers now. Do as we say or suffer the fate of Tokyo. And they hit
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:19.680]  a button and a space beam shoots down and disintegrates Tokyo. I am Zorg, mouthpiece
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:26.080]  of gravel. Do as we say. Everyone goes, yes, Zorg. I mean, literally, it's like Superman
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:31.560]  2, Neil Tzad, and everyone kneels. I mean, what's going on here? They're now to the kneeling
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:37.320]  point in every financial publication, going, world government is here, it runs everything,
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:41.160]  your slaves to it, and you'll never have a standard of living again, and we're gonna
[01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:45.400]  take over, and we're gonna take your guns and take your private property and conscript
[01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:49.280]  your children into work brigades. The White House is openly announcing that. We played
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:53.920]  that clip last week, and I'm supposed to just sit here and go, oh, this is a wonderful idea.
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:57.560]  Or Alex, don't get so upset. No, no, no, we need to get out of our coma. We need to get
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:00.680]  out of this daydream we're in, folks.
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:06.560]  It's like adults think they're getting away with something. I screwed off a lot this week.
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:11.840]  I went to two baseball games, and I got drunk four times, and I went and did this and that,
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:17.480]  and I blow, blow, and I got an easy job. Yeah, and that's why the globalists go, these are
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:22.960]  a bunch of chumps. Let's rob them. I mean, you think that's your birthright? You're all
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:30.600]  awake, you say. But you think I'm going to lead you out of something. Man, I can't even
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:35.880]  keep track of all their crimes, okay? I'm here risking my life because I understand it's
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:41.920]  the only future we've got. It's a gamble that we can beat these people. But there's no gamble
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:47.120]  that there's no future if we don't beat them. It's certain enslavement. It's certain death.
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:53.160]  Folks, this isn't just some tyranny that wants to be in charge. You understand what eugenics
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:58.320]  means? You better learn real quick, folks.
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:02.080]  You notice the cancer rates are off the charts, the neurological disorders and everything
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:08.080]  else. The U.S. leads the world in everything bad now. Folks, all the documents are public.
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:12.120]  This isn't just words. They put it in your food and water. They've done it to you since
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:16.240]  birth. They hated the land of the free, home of the brave. They were scared of us. We were
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:21.520]  going to be the example of human freedom and private property and guns and family and wealth.
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:27.040]  We had to be taken over and used to dominate the world while we were destroyed. We are
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:32.120]  the new world order's greatest enemy. I'll use a movie analogy because it gets through
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:37.880]  to people. Emperor Palpatine hates Darth Vader, but he uses Darth Vader and in the end he
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:42.480]  wants to kill Darth Vader. America is Darth Vader, ladies and gentlemen. And we have to
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:46.400]  ask ourselves, is there any good left in us? That's a question you have to ask yourself
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:51.240]  right now. And as things get crazier and more obvious, you're either going to get more
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:58.640]  committed to the evil or you're going to wake up and say no to the tyranny. Let's go to
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:01.800]  one call. Come back and take more. I kind of ran it during that segment. I still have
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:07.160]  a special report coming up. Frank and Louisiana, you're on the air, sir. Welcome.
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:14.640]  Hello. Yes, sir. You're on the air worldwide. Yes, Alex, speaking of the U.N., if you look
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:20.720]  at Black's Law Dictionary, this edition, page 816, it'll tell you that the International
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:28.080]  Monetary Fund is an agency of the U.N. Now, a lot of people know that the Federal Reserve
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:32.880]  is privately owned, but what they don't know is that the IMF and the Federal Reserve are
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:38.400]  flip sides of the same coin. It's the European side and the World Bank is the U.S. side.
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:44.600]  It's all on record. There's 11 major shareholders and JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Bank of
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:49.360]  America, Wells Fargo, Bank of England, right on the line. And no, you're right. The U.N.
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:53.400]  is their global bankruptcy receivership arm. You can even pull up quotes where they say
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:56.760]  it. They don't even hide it.
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:01.720]  Congressional record, not only will it tell you that the Federal Reserve has never been
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:06.760]  federal, of course, Lewis versus United States will tell you that, but the Congressional
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:11.920]  record will tell you that the same banking families have usurped the government and have
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:18.800]  funded the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 and funded the former Soviet Union during the
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:19.800]  alleged Cold War.
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:23.120]  No, no, they fund, it's all, and what's incredible is they have congressional hearings. It's
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:24.120]  all declassified.
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:32.240]  Yeah, read, type in the great patriotic Senator Lewis McFadden and then type in Congressman
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:36.200]  Charles Lindbergh, Sr. That'll give you, that's just the beginning of it.
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:37.680]  See, since Congress...
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:41.760]  Stay there. Stay there, brother. I want you to, a minute or two more of history. We'll
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:46.000]  take more calls and get to Aaron Dyke's report on this. Think about it. The U.N. is saying
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:53.000]  they're over America now and our military's been told they're under the U.N.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:23.000]  the U.S.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:53.000]  the U.S.
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:23.000]  the U.S.
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:53.000]  the U.S.
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:23.000]  the U.S.
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:56.000]  the U.S.
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:06.000]  the U.S.
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:34.000]  the U.S.
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:41.000]  the U.S.
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:33:09.000]  the U.S.
[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:16.000]  the U.S.
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:31.000]  the U.S.
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:41.000]  the U.S.
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:51.000]  the U.S.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  the U.S.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:09.000]  the U.S.
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  the U.S.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  the U.S.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  the U.S.
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:59.000]  the U.S.
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  the U.S.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:39.000]  the U.S.
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  the U.S.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:59.000]  the U.S.
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  the U.S.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  the U.S.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:29.000]  the U.S.
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  the U.S.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  the U.S.
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  the U.S.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  the U.S.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  the U.S.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  the U.S.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  the U.S.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  the U.S.

[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:29.000]  the U.S.
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  the U.S.
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:47.000]  the U.S.
