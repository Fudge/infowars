[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:33.360]  Texas Alex Jones it is Wednesday the 28th day of September 2011 I'm Alex Jones
[00:33.360 --> 00:38.360]  your host we're gonna be here for the next three hours live well coming up
[00:38.360 --> 00:45.560]  later in the hour I want to get into the amazing ABC News headline Al Ciaida or
[00:45.560 --> 00:54.360]  Al Ciaida came out yesterday and told Ahmed Denizide Denizade that the leader
[00:54.360 --> 00:57.760]  of Iran that how dare you say the buildings look like they were controlled
[00:57.760 --> 01:04.480]  demolition we did it and of course it's a message board and then you've got what
[01:04.480 --> 01:10.120]  four of the five Al Ciaida top men all born in the US publicly secretly
[01:10.120 --> 01:15.840]  meeting at the Pentagon and being caught running the attacks running the
[01:15.840 --> 01:20.680]  latest major Hassan attack the underwear bombing and more I mean it is so
[01:20.680 --> 01:26.240]  incredibly transparent all of this propaganda targets people that are just
[01:26.240 --> 01:33.080]  basically halfway paying attention that's what's happening here and so we're
[01:33.080 --> 01:39.240]  gonna be going over that today speaking of Al Ciaida being Western run
[01:39.240 --> 01:45.680]  nightmare in Libya thousands of surface to air missiles unaccounted for we've
[01:45.680 --> 01:50.320]  got that report of course that came out a few weeks ago but now it's back in the
[01:50.320 --> 01:54.880]  news now it's thousands including some heat seekers and don't worry though
[01:54.880 --> 02:02.240]  Al Ciaida leader Abdul bin Hodge we've been talking about this the last few
[02:02.240 --> 02:07.320]  months he's now writing columns Mr. Bell Hodge is writing columns for the
[02:07.320 --> 02:14.600]  London Guardian and we're told that the West is now running drone attacks out of
[02:14.600 --> 02:19.080]  air bases in Libya and other areas to fight Al Ciaida in North Africa so in
[02:19.080 --> 02:25.160]  reality they put Al Ciaida in but that's okay because they're fighting Al Ciaida
[02:25.160 --> 02:31.840]  I mean this is the incredible propaganda that we are basically force fed here's
[02:31.840 --> 02:35.920]  another one of London independent British soldiers in Afghanistan are shown
[02:35.920 --> 02:44.120]  snuff movies they're called kill knights meanwhile the troops are over there to
[02:44.120 --> 02:49.280]  grow the opium and you know it's funny that's just public information now it's
[02:49.280 --> 02:52.680]  like okay the government greatest government the US government they're
[02:52.680 --> 03:00.280]  involved in the harvesting and the production of all of this and here is the
[03:00.280 --> 03:11.360]  ABC News headline Al Ciaida to Iran stop spreading 9-11 conspiracy theories and
[03:11.360 --> 03:17.760]  it's always the usual suspects to put out these type of statements Adam Gadahn
[03:18.280 --> 03:23.960]  real name Adam Perlman grandson of the head of the ADL former head of the ADL
[03:23.960 --> 03:31.280]  who was arrested beating up Muslims outside mosque he hated him so much now
[03:31.280 --> 03:37.680]  he puts announcements out that coincide with the Pentagon military industrial
[03:37.680 --> 03:44.360]  complex agenda what was it four years ago wire magazine reported that they had
[03:44.360 --> 03:49.680]  their big tech expert look at the video uploads of Adam Gadahn and others and the
[03:49.680 --> 03:54.960]  Al Cida logo was in the same logo as the Pentagon connected groups putting the
[03:54.960 --> 04:04.080]  videos out but that's not enough evidence for you we again have and we're all
[04:04.080 --> 04:07.280]  locking and others meeting secretly at the Pentagon getting their marching
[04:07.280 --> 04:12.040]  orders that's now come out in the last year we've talked a lot about it and so
[04:12.040 --> 04:17.360]  different organizations wanted to wanted to do a for your request and find out his
[04:17.360 --> 04:23.520]  State Department sanctioned record State Department support and of course
[04:23.520 --> 04:28.800]  national security was declared on that and they don't care they even still have
[04:28.800 --> 04:32.640]  a lock he put out a little announcements always backing the police they always
[04:32.640 --> 04:38.920]  backing new wars this is full spectrum dominance where the globalist move
[04:38.920 --> 04:42.800]  their fake Al Cida chess pieces around wherever they want as a pretext to
[04:42.800 --> 04:48.520]  invade that country and with great disdain at the same time openly give real
[04:48.520 --> 04:53.800]  Al Cida control of Libya that's their disdain while saying Iran is Al Cida but
[04:53.800 --> 04:58.720]  separately having Al Cida then criticize Iran when Iran doesn't play along with
[04:58.720 --> 05:09.720]  fatal tyranny is here the grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality it

[08:33.280 --> 08:37.400]  20 minutes or so the next hour Wayne Madsen formerly with the National

[08:42.520 --> 08:49.360]  latest on Iran saying that they're gonna send warships off the US coast very bad
[08:49.360 --> 08:56.480]  move what does this signal no matter what quote side you're on I'm neutral in
[08:56.480 --> 09:02.680]  all of this baloney this is not a good thing also we can talk about the fact
[09:02.680 --> 09:07.800]  that alternative media reported years ago I went and looked it up prison planet
[09:07.800 --> 09:11.640]  two years ago reported on Facebook tracking everywhere you go after you
[09:11.640 --> 09:16.360]  leave Facebook even when you log out and selling the data to corporations and
[09:16.360 --> 09:22.920]  government Google does that they all do it all the big ones are government
[09:22.920 --> 09:29.360]  funded financed positioned behemoths and so Wayne Madsen only breaking that
[09:29.360 --> 09:35.720]  down I noticed that Facebook after info wars calm and natural news and others
[09:35.720 --> 09:40.520]  in the last few days wrote articles about Facebook admitting that okay they do
[09:40.520 --> 09:43.640]  track you everywhere you go even after you log out of Facebook they've now
[09:43.640 --> 09:49.880]  apologized and say they're gonna stop just like the founder of Facebook called
[09:49.880 --> 09:56.920]  you dumb bleepers last year when it first started to come out Tom Tom two
[09:56.920 --> 10:00.800]  years ago got caught selling your data and tracking you the GPS company and
[10:00.800 --> 10:04.880]  said they stopped they were in the news again yesterday caught again and they
[10:04.880 --> 10:10.520]  said don't worry we'll stop this is a psychological warfare operation when
[10:10.520 --> 10:16.000]  they look look there's a going for broke hoax happening all over the country they
[10:16.000 --> 10:22.520]  go on the news in the week before school and say it's the law go to this sports
[10:22.520 --> 10:31.400]  stadium and get your free shots there is no law 12 years ago the federal
[10:31.400 --> 10:35.640]  government signed secret deals made public last year to take all the death
[10:35.640 --> 10:40.480]  that benefits of all US military personnel from World War through World
[10:40.480 --> 10:46.120]  War two through to today the government now admits that they're growing the
[10:46.120 --> 10:52.760]  opium in Afghanistan it has now been confirmed in two federal courts they've
[10:52.760 --> 10:56.840]  had district attorneys go public on the Texas Mexico border sheriffs have gone
[10:56.840 --> 11:03.520]  public on this show years ago but in the news this week that indeed the US
[11:03.520 --> 11:09.360]  government allows select drug cartels to bring in unlimited tonnage of cocaine
[11:09.360 --> 11:18.540]  heroin and marijuana namely Sinaloa and that Sinaloa is then given firearms they
[11:18.540 --> 11:24.360]  don't allow guns to be sold out of shops to drug cartels and order the shops to do
[11:24.360 --> 11:31.680]  it they it just came out confirming what we already knew in one shop alone were
[11:31.680 --> 11:38.120]  ordered to basically sell at rock bottom prices paid for with taxpayer money to
[11:38.120 --> 11:45.000]  the Sinaloa cartel 2000 firearms out of one shop alone that came out two days
[11:45.000 --> 11:49.880]  ago we've covered it but I mean think about what this means this morning last
[11:49.880 --> 11:55.200]  night this morning today I thought about just dropping everything for about a
[11:55.200 --> 11:59.000]  week not doing the nightly news or having Aaron do it or others do it not
[11:59.000 --> 12:04.760]  doing the radio show and just chronicling digging through all of our
[12:04.760 --> 12:12.600]  massive research and assembling thousands of pieces of bedrock government
[12:12.600 --> 12:18.320]  corruption where it's absolutely admitted that they nerve gas and killed
[12:18.320 --> 12:23.600]  our own trips and tester shot up little kids with syphilis or fed pesticide to
[12:23.600 --> 12:29.320]  CPS grabbed kids just a few years ago or are growing the opium in Afghanistan or
[12:29.320 --> 12:35.600]  the CIA caught shipping cocaine in hundreds and hundreds of times and guns
[12:35.600 --> 12:42.280]  into Mexico and Dinecore and Halliburton and the Pentagon and the UN caught
[12:42.280 --> 12:46.800]  running giant child kidnapping rings when I mentioned that yesterday Dinecore
[12:46.800 --> 12:52.240]  child trafficking and it was it was Chicago Tribune BBC you also see our
[12:52.240 --> 12:59.720]  articles there but the point is it just hits me every moment that it's so
[12:59.720 --> 13:06.680]  overwhelming it's so ridiculous how over the top the corruption is and how
[13:06.680 --> 13:12.240]  naive we are you know I talked to repair people that come to my house I talked
[13:12.240 --> 13:18.080]  people on the street and I get a lot of feedback and I talked to people who've
[13:18.080 --> 13:23.160]  never heard of my show and you talk to somebody who is awake they won't shut
[13:23.160 --> 13:26.480]  up you know telling you about things because they care they're informed wow
[13:26.480 --> 13:31.160]  they know what's happening in the world and they want to stop it because they
[13:31.160 --> 13:34.480]  want to live in a better society and they understand history but when you
[13:34.480 --> 13:39.920]  talk to people that aren't aware they don't know about secret spying they
[13:39.920 --> 13:45.560]  don't know about bio warfare soft kill operations they don't know what sodium
[13:45.560 --> 13:52.240]  fluoride's doing to them admitted fact almost every EPA scientist themselves
[13:52.240 --> 13:57.360]  multiple times for over a decade has signed petitions and said please take it
[13:57.360 --> 14:03.120]  out of the water increases cancer and they give all the evidence for it plug
[14:03.120 --> 14:12.040]  my earpiece here I mean more and more when I sit here and I go over all the
[14:12.040 --> 14:20.320]  news all the information even before I go on air it's just it's mainly that the
[14:20.320 --> 14:29.280]  general public is in a trance and you talk to them I mean I remember 12 years
[14:29.280 --> 14:35.800]  ago or so documenting that on star was listening to you all the time with NSA
[14:35.800 --> 14:43.120]  computers non-stop transcribing everything you say and do in your car
[14:46.880 --> 14:57.720]  and I went on air and I reported it and I got attacked and called a cook even
[14:57.720 --> 15:03.000]  though I had the documentation and then this morning I'm listening to local
[15:03.000 --> 15:09.480]  talk radio you know the big talk station and I hear the talk show host with the
[15:09.480 --> 15:13.960]  co-host reading out of the news that okay wow on star actually listens to you
[15:13.960 --> 15:18.040]  with the microphone built into the cell phone the dash even when you turn it off
[15:18.040 --> 15:21.600]  and they sell it all the government insurance companies and they're tracking
[15:21.600 --> 15:26.920]  everything you do and everywhere you go and putting it into databases and the
[15:26.920 --> 15:29.440]  other hosts said well I don't have a problem with that I think that's good
[15:29.440 --> 15:34.400]  they want to take care of us and he wasn't being sarcastic the other host
[15:34.400 --> 15:39.320]  said really and he goes yeah everybody should have to have these in their cars
[15:39.320 --> 15:42.520]  well actually the federal government's come out for more than a decade and
[15:42.520 --> 15:47.560]  said that that's their plan see here's the problem of doing the show just while
[15:47.560 --> 15:52.560]  I was sitting there talking I remembered a month ago epoch times reported on it
[15:52.560 --> 15:58.360]  but it was also another publications in fact try to pull this up that Chinese
[15:58.360 --> 16:05.040]  Chinese are Chinese government putting tracker systems in cars and they call it
[16:05.040 --> 16:09.360]  a toll road system that you have to have in your car for for many of the roads
[16:09.360 --> 16:14.640]  being toll roads but they've the tech publications have analyzed it and found
[16:14.640 --> 16:22.600]  that it's actually a wireless tracker beacon and has a wireless audio sensor in
[16:22.600 --> 16:27.240]  it and that they are listening to people in their cars is basically an on-star
[16:27.240 --> 16:34.400]  chip full cell phone transmitter and it's like oh my gosh the communist
[16:34.400 --> 16:44.840]  Chinese aren't they incredibly decronium so my point is we are not in Kansas
[16:44.840 --> 16:51.760]  anymore I say that a lot I mean you don't need some loudmouth obnoxious Texan
[16:51.760 --> 16:57.080]  up here to tell you all of this but then it begs the question why is it more
[16:57.080 --> 17:05.040]  being done about this why aren't more of you angry and upset and involved in the
[17:05.040 --> 17:10.400]  final equation I don't like having a scientific dictatorship built over me
[17:10.400 --> 17:15.440]  by a bunch of control freaks who fall over one another to write books and
[17:15.440 --> 17:22.280]  publications calling for the reduction of the human population of 80% or more
[17:22.280 --> 17:28.000]  they started 80% and then have big debates and we've written countless
[17:28.000 --> 17:31.920]  articles on it and showed you their documents and made the film in game
[17:31.920 --> 17:37.360]  where you know they they put out articles defending Dr. Pionk at UT that
[17:37.360 --> 17:41.640]  says 90% need to be killed and sooner rather than later with the airborne
[17:41.640 --> 17:49.760]  Ebola and I had his graduate students send me threatening emails and I went
[17:49.760 --> 17:54.480]  and looked them up these were doctors and chemists and biologists couple of
[17:54.480 --> 18:00.440]  working in bio weapons facilities and it was like you know he's a very great
[18:00.440 --> 18:05.800]  man and by the way you ought to be glad that he's so liberal most of us believe
[18:05.800 --> 18:12.440]  humans are a disease and it will be a sheer pleasure to kill the final human
[18:12.440 --> 18:19.800]  and then I'm the bad guy for being against this they have troops growing
[18:19.800 --> 18:26.600]  opium on ABC news BBC and Fox telling us it's good every major vaccine
[18:26.600 --> 18:30.480]  manufacturer when they study the vaccine it's designed to do the opposite of what
[18:30.480 --> 18:38.600]  you're told the Gardasil clearly and Dr. Tenpenny agrees is a autoimmune
[18:38.600 --> 18:45.800]  disorder weapon these other vaccines you look at them they're filled to chop
[18:45.800 --> 18:51.080]  chopped filled with cancer viruses so is the Gardasil it's hidden in plain view
[18:51.080 --> 18:55.080]  it turns out oh wow this isn't really attenuated this isn't just the protein
[18:55.080 --> 19:01.880]  of the RNA of the virus it's a full RNA shell combined with the aluminum so it's
[19:01.880 --> 19:08.680]  going to bind with your DNA I mean it's hidden in plain view it's a bio weapon and
[19:08.680 --> 19:12.080]  of course it's screwing women up and screwing young girls up and there's
[19:12.080 --> 19:17.440]  all these thousands and thousands of horror stories and right at 24% of all
[19:17.440 --> 19:23.400]  vaccine adverse reactions reported to the federal system are Gardasil by the
[19:23.400 --> 19:28.840]  way on average 2% report adverse reactions so if it's 18 well now it's
[19:28.840 --> 19:35.080]  20 plus thousand I was corrected if it's 22,000 and growing and that's 2%
[19:35.080 --> 19:39.320]  holy mackerel and again I haven't even gotten the news you know I'll just read

[24:04.840 --> 24:12.200]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[24:12.200 --> 24:16.160]  all right let me start getting into the news
[24:16.160 --> 24:20.480]  later I'm gonna up the phones up as well
[24:20.480 --> 24:28.480]  it's just it's crazy to be informed and then see other people that have no
[24:28.480 --> 24:32.400]  idea about the three branches of government or how their state
[24:32.400 --> 24:39.280]  legislature works and I'm horrified by that you know the danger of how they
[24:39.280 --> 24:44.080]  can then be manipulated by the system but people that join the corrupt system
[24:44.080 --> 24:49.040]  they love the fact that the public is so gullible and dumb down and that and that
[24:49.040 --> 24:56.040]  tricks work on them and I mean I got children even if I was an evil person I
[24:56.040 --> 25:00.640]  wouldn't want them to grow up in a world run by corruption and lies and I'm not
[25:00.640 --> 25:04.760]  saying there's some utopian thing that's possible but we certainly could
[25:04.760 --> 25:08.720]  strive towards something better we know that we know we just give up on all
[25:08.720 --> 25:15.640]  standards things things degenerate and it freaks me out that they actually put
[25:15.640 --> 25:20.200]  real Al Qaeda in charge by name with people bragging that they've killed
[25:20.200 --> 25:27.160]  US soldiers in Iraq in control of Libya and then lecture us about how Al Qaeda is
[25:27.160 --> 25:34.720]  gonna attack America so I've got to have the TSA grab my genitals and then you've
[25:34.720 --> 25:38.320]  got all these federal memos where they admit they use the threat of terror as a
[25:38.320 --> 25:42.160]  right to federalize everything as a pretext to take our freedom I mean it's
[25:42.160 --> 25:48.100]  admitted the former had a homeland security governor rigid minute Tom
[25:48.100 --> 25:52.680]  rigid minute it was all fake so they issued fake terror alerts and it's weird
[25:52.680 --> 25:57.280]  that it's almost like the more corrupted gets the more some people just buy
[25:57.280 --> 26:03.280]  into it because well it's the establishment doing it now Congress
[26:03.280 --> 26:06.040]  does have the lowest approval rating ever and there's all the big polls out
[26:06.040 --> 26:10.600]  that people the vast majority think the government's not you know in their best
[26:10.600 --> 26:15.200]  interest in mainstream media is losing more and more credibility and viewers I
[26:15.200 --> 26:21.080]  mean those numbers come out every day so I should be positive but it's not
[26:21.080 --> 26:26.320]  enough it's not enough to just not believe these people are not like them
[26:26.320 --> 26:31.040]  they know you're awake and so they're gonna wreck everything and bring in a
[26:31.040 --> 26:36.200]  hard core tyranny to suppress us this isn't like we're just gonna figure out
[26:36.200 --> 26:39.960]  their evil and everything goes away it's at the point you figure out their evil
[26:39.960 --> 26:46.760]  that that they really show their teeth I mean I saw this I don't know two weeks
[26:46.760 --> 26:51.040]  ago it was reported that a bunch of service to air heat sinking missiles the
[26:51.040 --> 26:58.240]  type that one guy can operate you pull up on a highway outside an airport you
[26:58.240 --> 27:01.600]  know these things a lot of them I was reading have it can go up 10 15,000 feet
[27:01.600 --> 27:07.280]  the plane takes off it has no way to avoid it it's at two 3,000 feet flying
[27:07.280 --> 27:14.000]  over a neighborhood the guy fires it boom aircraft goes down and the feds
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.960]  will love that you see in old-time systems and even just 50 years ago if an
[27:18.960 --> 27:23.520]  agency screwed up and let something happen they wouldn't get more power they
[27:23.520 --> 27:29.360]  would get in trouble people would get fired or go to jail now you get promoted
[27:29.360 --> 27:35.200]  this is exactly what they want and so here it is it's confirmed thousands of
[27:35.200 --> 27:40.320]  missiles are missing in Libya now remember it was in the Washington Post
[27:40.320 --> 27:46.960]  last Friday that they're using drone bases in Libya and surrounding areas to
[27:46.960 --> 27:53.600]  quote fight Al Qaeda in the region because they know the average person
[27:53.600 --> 27:57.480]  reading that doesn't put two of you together and go but wait they admit
[27:57.480 --> 28:05.160]  they put Al Qaeda in power and the groups fighting the Libyan rebels are the
[28:05.160 --> 28:10.280]  opposite of Al Qaeda not saying they're really good either but it's just like
[28:10.280 --> 28:16.400]  when Bush said Iran is with Al Qaeda and Ahmed you know Deniz Yad is with Al Qaeda
[28:16.400 --> 28:25.360]  and and the dictator because they've had fake elections of Afghanistan
[28:25.360 --> 28:29.520]  Muhammad Karzai says sir they're not with Al Qaeda because he knew all over the
[28:29.520 --> 28:33.000]  Arab and Muslim world that was ridiculous it was like saying you know
[28:33.000 --> 28:40.440]  Bill Clinton is Chinese or something it just is just absolutely ridiculous but
[28:40.440 --> 28:44.280]  they're talking to an American audience and I remember you're here in Bloomberg
[28:44.280 --> 28:47.920]  radio a few weeks ago when they were laughing going Americans don't even hold
[28:47.920 --> 28:52.120]  passports on average or nowhere Europe is they'll never understand they're
[28:52.120 --> 28:57.000]  being screwed they were giggling but it's true I wouldn't laugh about it unless
[28:57.000 --> 29:05.040]  it was sardonically in a sad way you know I guess in a satirical sick laugh and
[29:05.040 --> 29:09.200]  I do that sometimes but this was a celebratory laugh haha the American
[29:09.200 --> 29:15.720]  people are idiots and here was the investor class getting off on that you
[29:15.720 --> 29:20.560]  know when you pull down society it pulls you down as well you end up getting
[29:20.560 --> 29:25.320]  carjacked you end up getting robbed your daughter ends up marrying trash you
[29:25.320 --> 29:31.160]  don't get away with all this stuff and all right here it is ABC news nightmare
[29:31.160 --> 29:35.160]  and Libya thousands of serviced air missiles unaccounted for and now
[29:35.160 --> 29:38.800]  they're gonna have to have checkpoints everywhere because Al Qaeda is gonna
[29:38.800 --> 29:46.720]  attack us but nobody asked the question Al Qaeda leader is now riding columns of
[29:46.720 --> 29:51.320]  London Guardian stay with us we're on the march the
[29:51.320 --> 30:02.040]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network you've heard Alex

[32:54.240 --> 33:19.360]  five-star soap.com
[33:19.360 --> 33:27.080]  you know I think the point that I need to make again because it's so central is
[33:27.080 --> 33:38.600]  that it is mentally ill to know that the government is run by corrupt ruthless
[33:38.600 --> 33:44.040]  special interest who are above the law and are getting away with crazier and
[33:44.040 --> 33:50.320]  crazier stuff by the day and then to continue though to believe anything the
[33:50.320 --> 33:58.280]  government or the media owned by these big banks tells you that is crazy I mean
[33:58.280 --> 34:02.280]  if you had an employee that lied to you ten times you'd fire him for sure on the
[34:02.280 --> 34:05.960]  second or third time wouldn't get to ten if you had a neighbor that constantly
[34:05.960 --> 34:09.520]  lied to you at the three or four times you'd learn that that guy's bad news and
[34:09.520 --> 34:14.200]  you'd you'd stop talking to them you might even move I know I've moved before
[34:14.200 --> 34:17.280]  when I've had bad neighbors
[34:19.440 --> 34:24.920]  but instead because we don't feel like we can get rid of these criminals we just
[34:24.920 --> 34:30.120]  kind of give in to them well that's what the pimp does now he slaps me across the
[34:30.120 --> 34:36.480]  face it's really a broken attitude so yes the people know on average every
[34:36.480 --> 34:41.320]  poll shows it the vast majority over 80% know the government killed Kennedy know
[34:41.320 --> 34:45.040]  the Federal Reserve's private ripping us off and and and know that we're in
[34:45.040 --> 34:49.640]  trouble and don't want the TSA sticking their hands down our pants that's right
[34:49.640 --> 34:58.720]  at 90% and don't want it at the NFL that's above 85% and but the the
[34:58.720 --> 35:04.160]  establishment's answer is not going to be oh well we'll just go away no they're
[35:04.160 --> 35:08.120]  used to having their way that's why they propose martial law in Milwaukee
[35:08.120 --> 35:12.080]  Wisconsin that's why all over the country they're just banning citizens
[35:12.080 --> 35:16.280]  communications or arresting people that try to politely bring up government
[35:16.280 --> 35:21.000]  corruption at city council meetings that's why the North Carolina governor
[35:21.000 --> 35:24.040]  the media is trying to say it was a joke now but he told the newspaper it was
[35:24.040 --> 35:28.280]  not a joke he said it seriously that because of the crisis they should just
[35:28.280 --> 35:34.400]  suspend Congress to spend elections for two years which would be suspending
[35:34.400 --> 35:38.720]  Congress it wouldn't be a real Congress anymore and that's all part and parcel
[35:38.720 --> 35:43.240]  with the Super Congress making the spending decisions on what bills get
[35:43.240 --> 35:47.320]  brought forward that is the power of the purse out of the general House into a
[35:47.320 --> 35:52.440]  Super Congress the Senate now is involved in bringing forward because it
[35:52.440 --> 35:55.760]  there's senators that are on it along with House members bringing forward
[35:55.760 --> 36:00.760]  spending legislation completely unconstitutional and then even you know
[36:00.760 --> 36:04.880]  so-called patriots and people out there can't get their minds around the fact
[36:04.880 --> 36:08.600]  that this is new and draconian they're like well we've had special committees
[36:08.600 --> 36:12.360]  before not like this when we haven't Ron Paul got it right and said it's not in
[36:12.360 --> 36:18.560]  the Constitution but that's not even strong enough language for what we're
[36:18.560 --> 36:23.080]  dealing with so what happens is people just get accustomed to tyranny by
[36:23.080 --> 36:30.480]  degree and they make more and more and more and more excuses for it
[36:32.760 --> 36:38.120]  look at this stack of news right here in fact if you give me a document cam shot
[36:38.120 --> 36:41.920]  in there prison planet TV folks can watch this all this news is up at info
[36:41.920 --> 36:46.240]  wars.com and prison planet.com if you're a radio listener and you can go check it
[36:46.240 --> 36:55.480]  out on star kills plan to track ex-subscribers every time they get
[36:55.480 --> 37:01.280]  criticized for this by the alternative media and it gets picked up they say
[37:01.280 --> 37:06.320]  okay we won't do that now you notice they send a message out saying even if you
[37:06.320 --> 37:11.400]  opt out or turn off the service we're going to have audio link and listen to
[37:11.400 --> 37:14.000]  you and we're going to track everywhere you go and we're going to sell that to
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.400]  insurance companies in the government but you don't think they're just you have
[37:18.400 --> 37:22.280]  all this technology because they care about you you don't just think you get
[37:22.280 --> 37:27.160]  a digital cable box because they love you it's tracking everything you do
[37:27.160 --> 37:33.000]  there was a public school in California and other one in in Pennsylvania a few
[37:33.000 --> 37:36.680]  years ago they came out and said kids be good we're watching you at home over
[37:36.680 --> 37:41.200]  your laptop and it was a minority of parents came out and said well that's
[37:41.200 --> 37:47.400]  big brother and the school said no that's safety and then the school had such
[37:47.400 --> 37:51.120]  disdain when they got criticized they suddenly switched gears and lied and
[37:51.120 --> 37:55.920]  said we're not listening or watching you they said but you were on the news here
[37:55.920 --> 38:01.280]  you are saying it so lawsuits were filed in the thousands of videos it was tens of
[38:01.280 --> 38:06.720]  thousands of videos and tens of thousands of photos of kids in the shower the
[38:06.720 --> 38:09.960]  school administrators the teachers could hardly get their work done watching the
[38:09.960 --> 38:17.400]  kids at home police were calling kids into the principal's office because they
[38:17.400 --> 38:23.600]  were seeing eating pills turned out it was Skittles and the I've noticed that
[38:23.600 --> 38:27.360]  when I was warning people about this beforehand when these big companies were
[38:27.360 --> 38:34.120]  bragging in their stock perspective boil downs and stockholder reports that
[38:34.120 --> 38:36.840]  they were watching everybody at home and tracking everybody and listening to
[38:36.840 --> 38:40.680]  everybody and every major company was doing it telecommunications act since
[38:40.680 --> 38:47.800]  96 everything wired in by federal regulatory law to do this but see they
[38:47.800 --> 38:52.320]  weren't ready for the public to know about that at that time so so I talk
[38:52.320 --> 38:57.080]  about it show documents they'd be like you know national TV local news this guy
[38:57.080 --> 39:01.360]  is a lunatic the government the corporations would never do that to
[39:01.360 --> 39:07.960]  you now that we've been eased into this they're like oh yeah every big company
[39:07.960 --> 39:14.960]  is doing it that's actually their biggest profit margin why the major pizza
[39:14.960 --> 39:19.680]  chains are now in some cases making more money per quarter on tips to law
[39:19.680 --> 39:24.200]  enforcement because they get 25% of the fines and fees then they do off pizza
[39:24.200 --> 39:29.080]  sales I remember seeing a case must have been 15 16 year no my grandfather was
[39:29.080 --> 39:38.160]  really and still alive in a good shape then I guess that was actually in I was
[39:38.160 --> 39:42.840]  in high school I was like 20 years ago I remember I should go over some Sundays
[39:42.840 --> 39:48.480]  and watch 60 minutes when my grandma made dinner grandma still alive and watch
[39:48.480 --> 39:51.880]  60 minutes I'll never forget watching 60 minutes and it was about how the air
[39:51.880 --> 39:57.800]  line ticket people in many cases make double or triple one lady was paid
[39:57.800 --> 40:00.680]  30 something thousand a year and she's made over a hundred thousand that year
[40:00.680 --> 40:05.720]  in when people paid cash calling air marshals on them and then they would
[40:05.720 --> 40:09.200]  just confiscate the cash ago you shouldn't have $10,000 and it was a
[40:09.200 --> 40:13.280]  case of with a guy sued and fought back he was from South Carolina flying to
[40:13.280 --> 40:18.040]  Houston and he liked to cash business they turned out his taxes were all
[40:18.040 --> 40:21.720]  paying everything and then he'd get a discount for paying cash he's an old
[40:21.720 --> 40:27.280]  guy on the barrel head for the trees they would then ship by 18 Wheeler a whole
[40:27.280 --> 40:32.880]  bunch 18 wheelers up to the Carolinas and they took his $10,000 and
[40:32.880 --> 40:36.320]  everything and it turned out that that ticket teller was getting some of the
[40:36.320 --> 40:43.400]  money I remember watching 60 minutes actually a pretty good show sometimes
[40:43.400 --> 40:47.280]  kind of old line journalism you know they're still globalist but they're so
[40:47.280 --> 40:51.920]  arrogant and want to be on top that they still report on things about major
[40:51.920 --> 40:56.720]  hospitals killing people for their organs of course it was the usual
[40:56.720 --> 41:01.600]  suspect Illinois New York places like that and of course just a few years
[41:01.600 --> 41:06.680]  before my dad said do not sign your organ donor card word is in Dallas
[41:06.680 --> 41:10.600]  hospitals they won't save you and will harvest your organs and my dad was a
[41:10.600 --> 41:14.080]  dentist or a surgeon and had worked rewiring jaws and things in hospitals
[41:14.080 --> 41:17.480]  and do a lot of doctors but I still remember thinking my dad was crazy when
[41:17.480 --> 41:21.240]  I was doing my driving test from 15 he said do not sign that organ donor card
[41:21.240 --> 41:31.520]  son do not sign it because the word is doctors in town say don't sign it but
[41:31.520 --> 41:36.200]  that's just a doctor-to-doctor thing you see and I'm thinking my dad is a funny
[41:36.200 --> 41:42.560]  guy's a smart guy but come on this stuff isn't true and then 60 minutes they're
[41:42.560 --> 41:47.280]  taking your organs they caught him in Austin taking organs of people and
[41:47.280 --> 41:53.360]  letting them die to get them and taking their corneas that's the big ones
[41:55.120 --> 42:01.320]  they even had one case where they thought they'd let the guy die and he they'd
[42:01.320 --> 42:07.160]  let the the anesthesia go away and he they already taken one of his kidneys
[42:07.160 --> 42:12.240]  that happened a few years ago and they were he woke up and on the operating
[42:12.240 --> 42:15.360]  table and the doctors were like put him down a nurse rebelled so the guy got
[42:15.360 --> 42:18.880]  sewed up and live that's why we know about it but you know that's how crime
[42:18.880 --> 42:24.640]  works though because that's how those hospitals work they'll give those
[42:24.640 --> 42:29.000]  doctors a little cut on the side of the 400 500 thousand organs they'll pull out
[42:29.000 --> 42:37.600]  of somebody and see it's only our naivete that allows all this to happen I
[42:37.600 --> 42:41.560]  know I keep going back to that but I talked to men and women and others and
[42:41.560 --> 42:45.760]  they can be successful business people but if they're not tuned into the real
[42:45.760 --> 42:48.640]  world they're only specialized in their area and they care about going to the
[42:48.640 --> 42:53.440]  movies or playing golf or collecting wristwatches or motorcycles or whatever
[42:53.440 --> 42:58.240]  it is you tell them basic stuff that's absolute fact and they'll look at you
[42:58.240 --> 43:04.200]  like you're crazy in fact this morning I was listening this local talk show
[43:04.200 --> 43:10.280]  host and he was talking about the the conspiracy theorist that don't like on
[43:10.280 --> 43:15.320]  star listening to you and tracking you so see I was a cook before for saying it
[43:15.320 --> 43:23.360]  was happening but now I'm still a cook I'm still a cook now that it has come out
[43:23.360 --> 43:27.920]  and is admitted I'm a cook for not liking it that's like medical device
[43:27.920 --> 43:32.040]  seller I talked to you on air but I've talked to other people in person it's
[43:32.040 --> 43:36.360]  happened to and he went back to his company many years to look I want to
[43:36.360 --> 43:41.800]  start working in the office I want a desk job even if it's a pay cut because I am
[43:41.800 --> 43:44.880]  tired of having my genitals grabbed all the time and going through this and they
[43:44.880 --> 43:48.200]  want to put me in microwave scanners and his boss said was so you're a
[43:48.200 --> 43:55.000]  conspiracy theorist now now let's get this straight he doesn't like going in a
[43:55.000 --> 44:02.520]  microwave oven he doesn't like having his space violated this is this is not
[44:02.520 --> 44:10.680]  disputed this is going on not liking it is a conspiracy theorist and you know
[44:10.680 --> 44:15.480]  some of these local shows I only try to call in every two three months and this
[44:15.480 --> 44:19.280]  particular show I've called him before and this call screener says no Alex I
[44:19.280 --> 44:22.040]  actually know the program director and he's like oh please call him we'd love
[44:22.040 --> 44:25.760]  to have you on any of the shows but you know the call screener oh I talked to
[44:25.760 --> 44:31.080]  the host that they don't want your input they just want to sit there and make
[44:31.080 --> 44:39.800]  jokes about me or when somebody calls in and brings up a fact well hey Ron Paul
[44:39.800 --> 44:43.320]  is actually winning many of these polls in a second or third place oh yeah and
[44:43.320 --> 44:47.520]  they start playing ex files music or Imperial battle March and go that sounds
[44:47.520 --> 44:54.240]  like Alex Jones turning the the light on at night if you go outside to put
[44:54.240 --> 44:59.960]  something in the trash can is evil is a conspiracy theory thinking being involved
[44:59.960 --> 45:07.240]  watching your step it's weird you see it's an attribute to be a sucker to be a
[45:07.240 --> 45:13.400]  chump to be an idiot I mean this is beyond 1984 in this nightmare horrid
[45:13.400 --> 45:18.680]  future that he foresaw under English socialism Eric Blair pen name George
[45:18.680 --> 45:25.160]  Arwell imagined where there's cameras and microphones at the park hidden and
[45:25.160 --> 45:33.360]  where your TV watches you two way I mean I remember a engineer from Time Warner
[45:33.360 --> 45:43.840]  contacting me 15 years ago and then even coming to my house in meeting with me
[45:43.840 --> 45:50.840]  and showing me the Atlantic scientific Atlantic cable box and showing me how
[45:50.840 --> 45:55.520]  there was a built-in microphone and explaining that no one it wasn't the
[45:55.520 --> 45:58.840]  manual it wasn't advertised what you would use it for and then it was two way
[45:58.840 --> 46:03.040]  and that they were gonna come out with DVR systems soon other companies were
[46:03.040 --> 46:07.120]  and that it was gonna track everything you did of course now that's all
[46:07.120 --> 46:10.000]  admitted and I went on air and warned people and got laughed at and then I'll
[46:10.000 --> 46:13.120]  years later out of Time Warner cable guy at the house one of the installers I
[46:13.120 --> 46:16.720]  said you know that's got a microphone the guys like yeah I know it's got one but
[46:16.720 --> 46:23.280]  so what are you you know act like I was weird because I mean this is what I'm
[46:23.280 --> 46:28.360]  talking about here oh you don't like people grabbing your genitals your
[46:28.360 --> 46:32.240]  conspiracy theorist that's like saying I like strawberry ice cream not chocolate
[46:32.240 --> 46:38.400]  and they say oh you're you're a conspiracy theorist you know I prefer
[46:38.400 --> 46:43.800]  dodge over Ford what you're you're in your conspiracy thinking is now a
[46:43.800 --> 46:50.920]  conspiracy theory I prefer Lyme top of Chico mineral water over regular
[46:51.800 --> 47:02.720]  see it's a throwaway line that they now just use against people it's like when
[47:02.720 --> 47:08.040]  that trader came out that stock trader came out on Goldman Sachs said they
[47:08.040 --> 47:11.200]  rule the world we're gonna have a depression money's all going out of
[47:11.200 --> 47:17.320]  Europe and BBC responded to their own report Forbes did I covered it last night
[47:17.320 --> 47:23.200]  on the nightly news and said is this a hoax is he a real trader because what he
[47:23.200 --> 47:27.120]  said was so true they just tried to imply oh it's a hoax instead of making it
[47:27.120 --> 47:30.560]  about the real issues he talked about they always want to change the subject
[47:30.560 --> 47:35.400]  so they had articles out earlier than week going is on star really listening
[47:35.400 --> 47:42.280]  when it was sent to 6 million on-store customers in North America and was
[47:42.280 --> 47:48.520]  confirmed by hundreds of technology publications and blogs still last week
[47:48.520 --> 47:52.720]  and this week it was is it real is it real nightly news they knew full well
[47:52.720 --> 47:58.600]  that it was real but they had to first say is it real to discredit it in the
[47:58.600 --> 48:02.600]  mind and say is it a conspiracy theory and then say okay they are but now
[48:02.600 --> 48:06.320]  they're not going to listen to you and track you but if you read the fine
[48:06.320 --> 48:12.600]  print they're saying okay if you opt out we won't track you anymore but of
[48:12.600 --> 48:18.200]  course these are big brazen exempt immune multinational tax exempt companies
[48:18.200 --> 48:24.920]  they are going to continue Tom Tom gets caught two years ago they're caught
[48:24.920 --> 48:29.880]  again Facebook caught two years ago they're caught again they're not caught
[48:29.880 --> 48:36.320]  this is a bum rush I remember ten years ago they had a big conference on RFID
[48:36.320 --> 48:41.040]  and tracking with big corporate leaders in Chicago and I was reading through the
[48:41.040 --> 48:46.360]  transcript a listener emailed to me who had nothing I went to the area and it
[48:46.360 --> 48:51.920]  had the big CEO up there going our perspective analysis shows 87% of
[48:51.920 --> 48:56.760]  people are against RFID and tracker systems but in another study we show
[48:56.760 --> 49:02.120]  that over 90% will end up submitting if we just force the issue but we've got
[49:02.120 --> 49:07.680]  to have industry unification to have mass adoption of this system and the total
[49:07.680 --> 49:12.840]  goal is total tracking and predictive systems that will allow us to predict
[49:12.840 --> 49:18.600]  future trends within close to 100% probability applause they're up there
[49:18.600 --> 49:24.800]  we have a crystal ball takeover system we will force this through I mean they're
[49:24.800 --> 49:28.840]  just right there in your face saying we are gonna force this down their
[49:28.840 --> 49:35.120]  throats and I can't even get the general public to wake up because they were
[49:35.120 --> 49:38.120]  preconditioned this didn't exist instead of going wow I was lied to this
[49:38.120 --> 49:41.040]  government and these corporations are out of control it's like well okay
[49:41.040 --> 49:43.680]  they're listening to us but I still like the government and maybe it's
[49:43.680 --> 49:50.160]  reasonable it's this little knitting thing where we're these these these
[49:50.160 --> 49:55.400]  these metrosexual men I've noticed they will like team up with the corruption
[49:55.400 --> 50:01.120]  they'll go when I'm fly that then and it's just like just because you sit there

[54:13.720 --> 54:19.400]  geopolitical developments including Iran saying they're gonna send warships to the
[54:19.400 --> 54:26.040]  US coast that's a horrible idea on Stark Hill's plan to track X subscribers and

[55:09.320 --> 55:15.080]  remember what does Zuckerman said he said you're a bunch of dumb efforts he
[55:15.080 --> 55:21.120]  said our users trust us and just started laughing ah ha ha oh it's so much fun
[55:21.120 --> 55:24.760]  he admitted he did that
[55:24.920 --> 55:29.280]  see the globalists revel in the fact that you don't want to believe they're
[55:29.280 --> 55:35.720]  bad people and so because you won't admit that they've got free reign over you
[55:35.720 --> 55:41.400]  they've got free reign over all of us all right I got a bunch of other news this
[55:41.400 --> 55:46.320]  is getting insane drudge linked to this yesterday AP labeled races for accurately
[55:46.320 --> 55:50.640]  transcribing Obama speech meanwhile a Puerto Rican guy don't even know what
[55:50.640 --> 55:53.480]  the Cougars clan is was an ice cream outfit and people thought it was the
[55:53.480 --> 55:59.040]  clan caused a big freak out they got a UC Berkeley bake sale ignites protest why
[55:59.040 --> 56:03.120]  they got a law about to be signed by the governor that says if you're black you
[56:03.120 --> 56:07.920]  pay a lot less tuition and that is discriminatory two wrongs don't make a
[56:07.920 --> 56:12.920]  right so they're calling them races for illustrating it for illustrating the
[56:12.920 --> 56:17.960]  racism the Air Force is going to be targeting on the highways of America
[56:17.960 --> 56:21.840]  underage drinkers that's how they decided to roll out troops on the streets
[56:21.840 --> 56:26.360]  that's all coming up but I wanted to briefly bring Ted Anderson up maybe it
[56:26.360 --> 56:29.440]  towards the end to with another update this is exactly what Ted said was
[56:29.440 --> 56:34.720]  happening Monday comics gold ends solidly higher on bargain hunting weaker
[56:34.720 --> 56:38.720]  U.S. dollars they've got the dollar only spike for a while higher crude oil
[56:38.720 --> 56:45.280]  prices gold silver jump as dollar sags selling pressure eases so that's from
[56:45.280 --> 56:51.440]  Kitco Forbes and Barons and they admit that it's all the big margin increases
[56:51.440 --> 56:56.200]  now they've basically made it super hard to trade in gold digitally but all
[56:56.200 --> 56:59.880]  that's doing is forcing people into the physical market Ted has found I want to
[56:59.880 --> 57:05.200]  be clear with you Ted is having ten times the sales he has ever seen right
[57:05.200 --> 57:10.040]  now you would think that people he's the owner of Genesis the owner of modest
[57:10.040 --> 57:15.040]  resources great patriot you would think because in past when gold's down people
[57:15.040 --> 57:18.640]  don't buy which I think is stupid Ted and I buy when it's down this is buying
[57:18.640 --> 57:22.960]  opportunity for gold and silver the market fundamentals are all there people
[57:22.960 --> 57:26.480]  actually gotten that and Ted is basically selling out of most of everything
[57:26.480 --> 57:30.200]  he's got Ted this is the first time you've seen this this is a big deal yeah
[57:30.200 --> 57:33.280]  it is a big deal I can tell you right now I've talked to a lot of wholesalers
[57:33.280 --> 57:36.680]  across the United States and other gold dealers too and it's all the same thing
[57:36.680 --> 57:40.360]  if they've been able to force people out of the futures market but they haven't
[57:40.360 --> 57:44.280]  done anything with the physicals even Bloomberg was reporting yesterday that
[57:44.280 --> 57:48.880]  China the demand for jewelry just went through the roof when the price went
[57:48.880 --> 57:52.920]  down it's like people are moving into the physical market or they look at
[57:52.920 --> 57:55.840]  the warning signs and everything that's going on they're moving into the
[57:55.840 --> 57:59.520]  bullion market it's all they're taken out are the people that are trading in the
[57:59.520 --> 58:04.120]  futures market which has a tendency to drive the market forces but I can tell
[58:04.120 --> 58:09.200]  you right now if you can stomach the volatility the governments and I don't
[58:09.200 --> 58:12.520]  even think this is coming out of Washington DC I would say the central
[58:12.520 --> 58:16.200]  banks that control the world that new world order you always talk about is
[58:16.200 --> 58:20.600]  pushing the reserve requirements down and that's why we have the volatility
[58:20.600 --> 58:24.400]  that's why we can get a better buy at this time but it is starting to go back
[58:24.400 --> 58:29.540]  up folks so get on the gold train silver train today call and ask about the
[58:29.540 --> 58:37.040]  index of radio specials they've got at the lower prices 800 686 2237 don't

[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:12.280]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:19.800]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:28.040]  Alex Jones well thousands of heat-sinking missiles have been given to
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:33.840]  Al Qaeda in Afghanistan Al Qaeda has been given control of the towns and
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:38.360]  cities they have Gaddafi still fighting on but the media has just moved from
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:43.240]  saying the war is over US troops are on the ground Wayne Madsen is going to be
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:49.200]  popping in to cover that the Iranian situation all of this spy grid that's
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:53.360]  going on and now being more and more admitted but Ted this is really big news
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:59.680]  that in your 30-plus years and in my even before you had Genesis you were
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:03.000]  a sponsor of my show I'm gonna sponsor about 15 and a half years Ted you've
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.640]  been there about a year and a half after I got on air or less that I've never
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:11.920]  seen it where the general public buys when it goes down which is what any good
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:18.880]  stockbroker commodity trader will tell you buy low sell hide that's when I buy
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:25.200]  and I've never sold because I'm doing it as an emergency backup but I have total
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:29.160]  confidence it would go back up as I said Monday as I said yesterday and it is
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:33.640]  starting to go back up because of global devaluation of currencies I would
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:38.920]  rather have a stable future and actually see golden silver drop and my
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:43.800]  investments not be good because overall the economy would be better it would be
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:48.400]  better for everybody and the other business operations we have would do
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:53.280]  better it's a win-win but I know that we're not going down that path we're
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:57.120]  going to why my republic path and I've seen them do this hammering the gold
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:01.120]  down and the silver down over and over again and then it always retraces it
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:05.040]  only goes back up but I I guess it's taken four or five times of this
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:09.040]  happening in the last three years for people to finally get it I mean this is
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:14.280]  big news Ted that you're seeing ten times the business you had a month ago two
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:18.720]  or three times any previous record you had to that even in even in bull markets
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:23.560]  it how big of a deal is this Ted that the people finally get it well I mean I
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:27.480]  can tell you it's certainly a turnaround because in the past when the market
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:31.880]  would fall you people would just back off and they'd quit buying and you know
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:36.240]  you'd give opportunities for me to go and okay I can see that it's time for me
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:40.480]  to buy because everybody else don't want it but right now with the with the
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:44.040]  governments and I keep saying governments but it's really not with them in
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:47.520]  their manipulating and trying to raise the reserve requirements to get into a
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:50.920]  futures contract they are they're messing with the paper system but
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:54.840]  obviously the people of the world right now are looking at it and going you know
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:58.560]  what I don't believe you guys I don't think that we're running into better
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:02.560]  economic times I can read the news myself I mean my goodness look what
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:08.160]  CNN had reported it says Greek Portugal and Ireland are on life support Italy
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:12.600]  and Spain are exhibiting worrisome symptoms and Germany and France the
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:16.720]  healthy ones are suffering from global economic and our listeners have heard
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:20.800]  all of our experts and ourselves tell them no matter how big the bailout it's
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:26.520]  only going to get worse that's why our credibility continues to rise Ted what
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:30.640]  do you see happening with silver and gold coming up in the next few weeks well
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:35.120]  I mean it for sure in the next few weeks it's going to be questionable as to
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:39.320]  whether or not the globalists will lose control over the futures market they
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:44.280]  may be able to hold gold and silver at the 16 to 17 hundred dollar level for a
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:48.200]  little while but you know what they will lose control and it'll continue to
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:52.960]  increase I I can tell you this in my lifetime I've never seen a time where
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:56.960]  the dollars gain purchasing power and inflation has gone in reverse and I've
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:00.720]  actually been able to buy more with my money it just hasn't happened cars have
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:05.220]  gone up everything has gone up houses in whatever you name it but now we're
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:09.360]  sitting in this crisis thing and they're thinking that they can solve this
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:13.920]  problem by making it so you can't trade futures contracts I mean it's like you
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:17.200]  know what they're trying to do is they're trying to put pass legislation to
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:20.680]  force people out of the gold market and that's just not going to happen it's not
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:23.360]  going to push people back into the currency and think that paper is better
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:27.280]  again people want to have gold because they know they can trust it and that's
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:31.880]  why people are buying it right now and they should be and you know a perfect
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:34.920]  example as to why they should be getting involved with those silver dollars that
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:39.920]  we talked about and that and the video in the book I mean now's the time to be
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:44.760]  moving you have the opportunity the prices are low you're right Ted folks

[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:39.240]  the governor is clearly North Carolina Governor Bev Perdue Democrat is
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:44.360]  proposing suspending the congressional elections for the cycle so legislators
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:48.640]  can focus on fixing the economy and it was serious the newspaper has said it
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:53.080]  was like it was serious this is the kind of stuff that's being talked about we
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:56.720]  already have a super Congress Obama's already launching wars without
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:00.960]  congressional approval and saying he doesn't need them the federal government
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:07.480]  is spying on us without warrants I mean it's all come out Tom Tom Facebook all
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:13.240]  of them are spying on us without warrants big time in our face and it's time
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:18.200]  that we face those facts I want to go to Wayne Madson on a host of issues
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:22.640]  formerly with the national security agencies written for some of the biggest
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:26.840]  publications in this country really doesn't need much introduction on this
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:31.680]  radio show his websites Wayne Madson report calm he's also worked as one of
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:36.200]  the founders of electronic privacy Information Center epic that just does
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:43.360]  great work and he joins us today to get into well just a bunch of different
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:49.520]  issues first off Wayne from what I've seen with the different telecommunications
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:55.200]  acts the cell phones the Facebook of the telecommunications systems the on star
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:00.560]  I mean it's always been spying on everybody this is a total merger of
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:05.200]  government and big corporations from your research dealing with this why do
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:09.280]  you think it's coming out now that on stars tracking you and listening to you
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:12.800]  with audio and that Facebook's tracking everywhere you go even when you leave
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:17.920]  Facebook and Tom Tom selling your data or when you call in order a pizza they're
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:22.880]  selling that data to the cops well I think this is something that's been going
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:28.680]  on as far as what's been on the FBI's wish list and other intelligence agencies
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:33.320]  and law enforcement agencies for quite some time and now we're finally getting
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:38.680]  the devil into details and this is something that first started under the
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:42.640]  Clinton administration when we had this huge battle over the government
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:48.880]  retaining encryption keys to be able to decode encrypted communications and
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:54.280]  we fought strenuously against that and the FBI and others always said oh we
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:11:02.120]  only do this in the event of a smoking gun a kidnapping situation all these
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:06.320]  you know worst-case scenarios and we always knew they were lying about it
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:09.840]  that they just wanted to have these capabilities for their fishing
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:14.080]  expeditions and lo and behold that's what we seem to have now that there is no
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:19.080]  criminal predicates when the FBI and the NSA and these other agencies conduct
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:24.240]  these forms of electronic surveillance and here we have everything is basically
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:30.720]  fair game everything's on the table as far as surveillance is concerned well
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:36.240]  Wayne where is this going because you have this coming out now it's it's
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:42.240]  Facebook and Tom Tom and on Star and the rest of them telling on themselves
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:45.800]  they're trying to send out little customer announcements hey by the way
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:49.720]  we're the our main business is not you paying for your subscription we're
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:53.280]  tracking everything you do and selling it to insurance companies you name it I
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:58.920]  mean this is beyond 1984 well that's right I think what they're trying to do
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:03.440]  is cover their butts from wall suits from from customers and people who feel
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:08.320]  that their privacy has been invaded we we had this battle a long time ago too on
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:14.280]  the issue of opt-in or opt-out as far as you know these type of surveillance is
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:20.760]  concerned and and clearly we have these companies now engaging in an opt-out
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:25.080]  that you're already in their surveillance system but now it seems like you
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:29.400]  don't even have a choice of whether the whether to opt-out or not well yeah that
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:32.760]  was the new controversy is they've always said hey we're spying on you but
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:36.560]  people wouldn't read their their little terms and conditions now they're saying
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:39.720]  we don't care if you buy the car and never turn it on we're gonna track
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:44.360]  everything you're doing I mean this is this is an outrageous outrageous power
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:50.160]  grab well absolutely and of course they're sharing it with not only the
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:54.200]  government but they're selling this information to other companies and
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:59.760]  people always say well you know what what what do you have to fear most private
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:03.880]  companies or the government well it's always been the case that the that the
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:07.200]  government needs private companies the traffic in this type of personal
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:12.960]  information are working together so there's really no line between the two
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:16.740]  now Wayne is there anything else you want to add on this subject before I
[01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:22.280]  shift gears to Libya I would just tell people you know that they need to be
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:27.960]  what I do when I meet a confidential source is I get rid of the electronics
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:33.240]  all together and when I meet somebody it's face-to-face and I take precautions
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:39.000]  that I'm not followed that there's no boom microphones or shotgun microphones
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:45.120]  in the area and and if people have the want to engage in personal and sensitive
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:50.760]  confidential communications face-to-face it's the only way and even then you got
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:53.920]  to watch it because they've got gunshot detectors in most cities that are
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:58.240]  actually high-powered acoustical microphones they put these in in 98 in
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:01.880]  Austin and the actual government grant admitted that that was a high-powered
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:06.400]  acoustic shotgun mics that can be directed and listened through the windows
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:10.760]  of your house from the vibration to the membrane that can listen to people hundreds
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:15.400]  of yards away but they told everybody in Austin it was gunshot detectors to
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:18.960]  triangulate where the gunshots come from another all over the city in most
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:23.600]  areas in parks listening to everyone think about it land the free home of the
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:27.920]  brave and on-star admits they've got audio listening to you and they're
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:33.120]  selling where you go to the cops and the corporations and even if you don't want
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:39.360]  it on it is now looking at Libya I of course you've been to Libya recently
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:44.000]  and Gaddafi still there still fighting but now it's kind of moved off the front
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.760]  page of the news and we have the Al Qaeda commander who's in charge of Tripoli
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:52.800]  and looks like he may be the new leader of the whole country this Abdul
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:57.840]  Belhaj guy now writing articles for the Guardian we have that article out today
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:03.720]  at m4wars.com by Tony Cartolucci breaking it down but here's ABC news a few
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:06.480]  weeks ago they were worried about heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:09.840]  that could you know take down any passenger liner they want now they
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:14.240]  admit thousands of them are missing and have fallen into the hands of Al Qaeda but
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:17.960]  and we're told they're having to move drones into Libya to bomb the rest of
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:22.480]  Africa because of Al Qaeda but they just put Al Qaeda into power so this this
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:27.080]  looks like a real setup by the system to take even more liberty saying they're
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:31.680]  protecting us from Al Qaeda well that's right we also know that from the ABC
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:36.800]  news report that now the Pentagon says they have to put personnel in Libya to
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:42.280]  be able to you know get these surface-to-air these man-tags or these
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:48.880]  handheld or a shoulder launch missile launchers and so what we're seeing now
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:53.960]  is a reason to put boots on the ground now we always knew that there were
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:57.880]  special operations in there but now it looks like the Pentagon is going to use
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:04.280]  this report as a reason to put troops in Libya and it's just you know it's
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:11.320]  another example of the US being ultimately behind at least the CIA being
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:16.720]  behind these so-called Al Qaeda brigades all over the world I have a story up at
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:23.840]  my website today how the CIA is basically using Al Qaeda, Jama'a, Islamiya as a
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:29.480]  reason to destabilize or amese to destabilize the government of Indonesia
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:33.960]  just like they've done in Pakistan so this is this this is the real purpose of
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:42.560]  these so-called jihadist groups it's destabilization across from Morocco all
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:47.200]  the way over to Indonesia and they use them against the Serbs and the Russians
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:53.000]  everybody else but if you have any geopolitical understanding any common
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:59.840]  sense you knock out Qaddafi who's made peace deals to put Al Qaeda in and then
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:04.200]  oh now we've got to occupy the country and use it for African as you predicted
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:09.400]  as I predicted as a base to invade other countries to fight Al Qaeda who you
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:12.880]  actually just put into power it's just a label I mean they could come just put a
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:16.480]  Al Qaeda sticker on your door and say well we're taking your house there's an
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:21.720]  Al Qaeda sticker it's a chess piece they move around to invade any country they
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:27.000]  want even when they put the Al Qaeda in power I mean it is and Tony Blair can
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.280]  meet six times secretly with Qaddafi and invest with him and all of this comes
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:36.400]  out and nobody gets in trouble it's total la la land in closing wings I know
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:41.320]  you got to go I understand Iran angry that US warships and others are all
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:45.880]  around them and that before the Iran-Iraq war I did fully ended the US
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:49.760]  attack and blew up most of the Iranian Navy and then that big naval engagement
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:55.960]  nobody seems to know about but in the final equation here this is a big
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:18:01.160]  provocation and I see they're saying it's a it's hypocrisy of the US it's mad
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:05.240]  about Iranian warships off our coast and international waters well why do you
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:10.320]  have your ships you know a half mile off our coast but what's behind this well
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:15.560]  we I would note that the chairman of Joint Chiefs Admiral Mullen recently
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:19.600]  stated that he thought there should be a hotline a military hotline between US
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:24.520]  forces in the region in Iran's military to just prevent any sort of
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:29.120]  misunderstanding you know there's a Iranian speedboats that are basically
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:32.240]  under the control the Iranian Revolutionary Guard that sometimes come
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:38.000]  out and circle US warships so he this looks like it may be an attempt to
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:44.400]  scuttle that idea of Admiral Mullen to have this hotline by ratcheting things
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:50.360]  up of course if Iran were to put ships off our coast and it's not clear that
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:54.320]  they even have a capability it would probably be something like we saw
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:19:00.200]  during the Soviet times where Soviet task forces would skirt the US coast on
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:04.160]  their way to Cuba they would need someplace to go to here in the Western
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:09.040]  Hemisphere you know Venezuela but let me stop you right there I totally agree
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:12.840]  with that analysis this is their military industrial complex their hard
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:16.280]  liners don't want to make friends as well because they want to use that as a
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:20.680]  way to stay in power that's right that's right and just like we saw during the
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:26.560]  Cold War I mean a year after Kennedy was basically eliminated by our military
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:31.120]  industrial complex the key to Khrushchev was eliminated eliminated by the
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:36.080]  Soviet military industrial complex we went from a burgeoning date on of course
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:42.160]  to the icy years of the Cold War Wayne Madson Wayne Madson report.com

[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:55.880]  mean I said I said watch they're gonna go put Al Qaeda in and then have to
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:25:00.000]  invade to get rid of Al Qaeda I mean there's just no end to it there's no
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.320]  end to the fact that they think you're blind and unaware of what's happening
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:11.640]  and here's ABC News Al Qaeda to Iran stop spreading 9-11 conspiracy theory I can
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:18.960]  hear good old boys boy even Al Qaeda told that Ahmed Dimitri Z over there in
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:22.000]  the Middle East he's not the Middle East he's in Persia but they call him a
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.560]  Middle Easterner to stop saying that well he's an engineer and we've got
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:31.040]  thousands of American engineers and German and others in the former Italian
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:34.480]  president the former head of intelligence for the German government
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:41.120]  their former defense sec we've had him on we need to get Andres von Bülow back
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:45.040]  on he hadn't been on in years he speaks pretty good English he wrote the best
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:49.480]  selling book in Germany the CIA carried out 9-11 that what translates out of
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:56.920]  in German and we are to believe because the Associated Press and others will
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:02.120]  just take a message board comment say oh Al Qaeda took responsibility for making
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:07.680]  Santa Claus wear a red hat I mean it's just it's just absolute baloney the
[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:13.440]  terror group Al Qaeda has found itself curiously in alignment and agreement
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:20.360]  well they do that all the time with the great Satan which it calls the U.S. in
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:26.360]  issuing a stern message to Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmed Dinajad stop
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:32.040]  spreading 9-11 conspiracy theories that's got a really upset the globalist
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:36.000]  that everybody knows it's an inside job and the latest issue of the Al Qaeda
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.480]  English language magazine inspire and I know Paul Watson and Kurt Nemo have
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:45.680]  written articles about inspire connected to the State Department Israel and
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:50.720]  others in fact I want to report on this the problem with my guys is they know
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:55.400]  so much because they study the stuff 12 14 15 hours a day that well I know when
[01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:58.200]  I go back there to Curtin say right about this will go but we did write about
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:02.360]  it a year ago I know but we've or I'll tell Watson we've got to write about it
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:09.160]  over and over again they are going to continue to put these lies out the
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:13.080]  latest issue of the Al Qaeda English language magazine put out by Adam Qadha
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:19.280]  on the grandson of the former head of the ADL I mean come on four of the five
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:24.040]  Al Qaeda commanders in the top five born in the U.S.
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:30.840]  I mean imagine Al Qaeda anti-Israel all the way if you believe it exists going
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:38.680]  oh yes our commander is Jewish I mean this is so ridiculous and the latest
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:43.200]  issue of the Al Qaeda English language magazine inspire an author appears to
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:48.960]  take offense on an author you mean it Lain Lee Virginia for the ridiculous
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:55.280]  theory repeatedly spread by leader of Iran that 9-11 terror attacks were
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:57.960]  actually carried out with the U.S. government order to provide a pretext
[01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:00.960]  to invade the Middle East I don't know Dick Cheney wrote the PNAC documents
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:05.760]  saying they need a Pearl Harbor style attack killing at least 3,000 people even
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:11.040]  name the number I don't know how they got that so accurate that's how many died at
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:16.920]  Pearl Harbor 3,000 roughly that of 9-11 they said a Pearl Harbor size event and
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:21.680]  they said to invade the Iranian government has professed on the tongue of
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:26.000]  its president that it does not believe that Al Qaeda was my 9-11 but rather the
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.840]  U.S. government an article reads so we may ask the question why would Iran
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:34.160]  ascribe such a ridiculous belief that stands in the face of logic and
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:42.040]  evidence totally fed written that's funny because any real Al Qaeda and
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:46.320]  that's just jihadi fighters out of Saudi Arabia they just put in power in Libya
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:51.480]  NATO our own government did would know that there are four groups Western
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:56.520]  financed in the last decade publicly in the last five years the White House
[01:28:56.520 --> 01:29:00.920]  admitted this under Bush launching terror attacks in Iran and that quote Al
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:05.560]  Qaeda are the ones always blowing up a plane with Iranian commanders on it or
[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:13.840]  killing Iranian military people in their military cities and then you read and
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:18.680]  the White House says yeah we're using Al Qaeda to try to overthrow Iran and then
[01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:24.160]  we see this Al Qaeda group saying this I mean it's it's this is written when you
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:30.080]  read this for the last it'd be like if they said yeah the Dallas Redskins were
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:37.960]  fighting the Washington Cowboys I mean for a Middle Eastern or a central Asian
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:43.800]  person for any of those people they read this and it does none of it makes
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:49.360]  sense this is only aimed at ignorant people in the West I mean it's just it's
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:55.000]  a comic book we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:03.000]  GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.440]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:11.480]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:15.400]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:19.400]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:23.960]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:28.000]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.800]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:35.400]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:39.760]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:42.880]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:22.020]  okay your phone calls are coming up and then in the next hour I'm gonna get in
[01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:27.600]  to this in detail Herman Cain describes Ron Paul supporters concerns as
[01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:32.160]  stupid what do you expect for somebody that works at the Federal Reserve in
[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:39.360]  policy and somebody who wants a national sales tax on top of the income tax and
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:43.600]  who supports the Patriot Act torture and everything else Herman Cain ought to
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:51.520]  love Obama but there is the novelty of the fact that he will criticize some of
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:56.280]  the other Republicans up there and the fact is he was designed just like Rick
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:34:00.240]  Perry to go after Ron Paul and so you notice is Rick Perry star begins to fall
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:04.120]  at least for a period of time then they try to sneak him back out later
[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:12.200]  Herman Cain now is ahead of Obama in the polls one point behind him and others
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:17.160]  Ron Paul is five points ahead I covered that poll yesterday in a scientific
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:20.600]  poll ahead of Obama if the election was held today a few points behind him and
[01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:27.640]  other polls so Ron Paul Herman Cain uneducated uninformed Republicans you
[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:30.600]  know think Herman Cain's anti-establishment they don't know his record yet
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:35.520]  just like they were uneducated on Rick Perry and we're gonna educate him and
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:39.600]  I gotta say Herman Cain is not as bad as Rick Perry or Mitt Romney I mean it's
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:46.560]  hard to support Al Gore and support Hillary care and both of them of course
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:51.120]  big supporters and to be for gun control and go to Bilderberg group meetings
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:56.160]  I mean it's it's it's really hard but Herman Cain's better he actually works
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:35:01.040]  for the very group that Ron Paul is going after but I mean it's hard to be as
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:04.800]  bad as as Rick Perry or Mitt Romney that's why the establishment puts them
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:08.520]  forward as the front runners Ron Paul undisputed third place as we destroy
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:11.920]  those two candidates he will go into first place that's coming up also Jesse
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:16.080]  Ventura calls for NFL boycott over TSA style groping we got some good news
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:19.920]  from the NFL you know I called for a boycott a few weeks ago when they
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:23.240]  announced they're gonna start groping her genitals and women's breast we've got
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:29.320]  some good news announced by the NFL not perfect but it's some good news showing
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:34.160]  the power of the boycott see the feds want to bankrupt the airlines and then
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:37.640]  nationalize it so they're more than happy to have a boycott of the airlines they
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:45.120]  still want it all at once and they don't want to blame but on the subject of the
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:50.160]  NFL and shopping malls where you'll get a good a good groping a good sexual
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:54.240]  molestation the boycott is king so we're gonna talk about that coming up
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:57.960]  after I get to some of your calls as this hour ends as we go into the next
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:05.160]  hour 800 at 2 5 at 9 90 31 also it's been confirmed the governor of North
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:08.920]  Carolina was very serious when she said to spend the elections for the economic
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:12.720]  crisis and that's been batted around they have under Bush and now Obama
[01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:18.080]  executive orders that we've covered here or for any emergency including any
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:21.800]  emergency including economic or any other unstated emergency the president
[01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:26.320]  can suspend Congress for six months and then under that power he can then
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:30.200]  suspend it indefinitely and but he won't have to Congress is already gone on
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:34.560]  spending and been turned over to the council of 13 the 12 members of the
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:39.440]  House and Senate and then the president as the supreme ruler so we are
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:42.680]  certainly getting maneuvered down a rat hole we've also got a bunch of economic
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:47.960]  news coming up without a growth plan the EU faces financial waterloo or
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:52.840]  destruction continuing we got a bunch of other economic news they now admit
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:57.000]  that the Obamacare plan has massively increased the price of insurance well it
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.040]  was written by the insurance companies I mean what do you it's a ripoff it doesn't
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:05.480]  cover pre-existing it's it's a ripoff but it feels good doesn't it that's all
[01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:10.720]  coming up and in closing next hour I will cover this in the towards the end
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:14.400]  of the next hour and I will have a special on it a lot of production going
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:19.600]  into it to show examples of this tonight on info wars nightly news AP labeled
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:23.800]  racist for accurately transcribing Obama speech our article went up on drudge
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:27.680]  yesterday red-linked so we got about a million visitors from that thank you
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:33.720]  drudge for covering real news but I'm gonna dovetail that with Hillary going
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:37.200]  to Kentucky talking like a hillbilly remember that how about Rick Perry
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:42.880]  literally trying to talk like slowpoke and solace all these politicians do it
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:46.440]  but Obama when he gets in front of a black audience starts talking like he's
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:51.120]  iced tea or something and the AP's being called racist for transcribing what he
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:56.760]  actually said and look it's not about race it's about people playing folks to
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:02.080]  be fools they do it to everybody I mean I've seen northerners come down here and
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:05.640]  put on a Texas accent I've seen southerners go up to New York and do it
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:11.120]  it's as if somebody really wants to be talked down to and have their voice
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:16.160]  changed I mean it'd be like if I had a oh we got a great guy from China that
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:21.280]  works here in my office a programmer and I don't come over to him and then like
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:26.800]  you know put on some stereotypical affected Asian voice when I talked to him
[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:31.840]  I just talked to him he's a man he's a human being I find that insulting I've
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:35.400]  been like Mexican food restaurants with friends before and a Hispanic you know
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:41.680]  waitress brings over food they're like the people are just looking at you going
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:46.360]  what the I mean but the point is why do politicians do it we're gonna talk about
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:50.560]  that now the balance of this segment for the next 12 minutes I wanted to bring
[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:53.680]  up somebody who hadn't been on with us for a few months and by four or five
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:58.240]  months he is a sponsor but the reason I've got him up here today is because he
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:02.920]  is the oldest and longest continually operated many claim they are I've checked
[01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:07.060]  he's the real deal and the biggest storeable foods manufacturer in the
[01:39:07.060 --> 01:39:11.400]  United States non-gmo non-hybrid and he's making it new every week with
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:16.600]  giant factories you do not want and I'm not bashing other folks but I found e
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:21.840]  foods over a decade ago looking because I kept buying stuff with additives and
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:28.960]  crud and MSG and 10 years old repackage this is all fresh fresh fresh but
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:32.240]  that's not why he's here he's not here to even pitch the food at you I wanted to
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:37.920]  get Steve on for me foods direct Steve shank on because we're seeing commodities
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:43.240]  go up again we're seeing depression loom and and folks we need to be prepared we
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:46.040]  need to have storeable food but the reason I've got him on is because I
[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:50.400]  promised them back up an update on he's buying food a year out food that hadn't
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:55.880]  grown yet but in the futures he's to try to keep prices low he buys food a year
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:40:00.720]  out he's buying the crop next year okay hadn't grown yet but he's buying it and
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:04.280]  he can give us exactly because he predicted five years ago the already
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:08.000]  the huge inflation of food we've seen many cases of doubling and I didn't even
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.280]  hardly believe it then now he can give us an update of where we are right now
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:16.160]  Steve thanks for joining us hey it's good to be aboard Alex you know I'm
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:20.160]  ranting about a lot of issues but all of it ties into food where are you
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:24.480]  right now with your factories I know can package millions of packages a week
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:30.240]  where are you on the futures well the problem of the future is we just had
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:34.760]  this last week the reason I wanted to get back in touch with you is that we all
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:41.040]  of a sudden have just an instant jump in some of the basics rice beans pasta the
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:45.280]  the grain of the wheat that they make pasta from as a result of this ethanol
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:52.320]  thing our our bread wheat is being thrown into animal feed because it's
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:57.520]  it's now cheaper than corn as a result of the fact that ethanol has pushed the
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:02.000]  price of corn up and as a result has pushed up the price of gas and we've
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:05.360]  just got this domino effect it's absolutely insane that you and I've
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:09.440]  talked about before yeah you predicted it you predicted five years ago you
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:13.200]  predicted it five years ago the wheat going nuts everything is going up by
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:19.080]  20% by the end of the month wow okay continue to break that down for us well
[01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:23.640]  what happens is when we've got when we've got things going on like the
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:29.120]  stock market literally the stock market is crashing every other day and it's
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:33.720]  re-crashing it and what have what that means to the people out there is that
[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:38.480]  companies are going to go under jobs are going to be lost and they won't be
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:44.200]  able to afford to buy the food that that that is already too expensive for like
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:50.400]  40 40 million Americans that are on food stamps and so this trend that we're
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:56.240]  seeing this perfect storm with the stock market now affecting food prices with
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:42:01.160]  the ethanol and the gas prices affecting food prices and it's kind of
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:05.400]  interesting Alex the the media came out and is ringing their hands over the
[01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:11.280]  shortage of pumpkins well I hate to tell you this but the same land that they
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:15.680]  grow pumpkins on we actually need the food from and that's that's been going
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:18.680]  downhill too because of all the flooding and also the droughts and
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:22.960]  everything that's going on with food production not just in America but
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:28.800]  worldwide so we've got the major population centers of the world China
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:33.480]  India out farming the rest of the planet for anything they can get for food and
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:39.620]  so that's what's causing this immediate jump I mean in one month's time the
[01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:45.600]  pasta the pasta grains go up 20% rice beans some of the basics and then
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:51.320]  everything else is is is going up crazy even able to get prices down people that
[01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:56.600]  they need to get going at anything that they can do to get in food and what we
[01:42:56.600 --> 01:43:03.120]  did was we this is just an aside we told people to get their orders in because
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:07.000]  of the free shipping that we've got going on here for a short period of
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:11.720]  time but the main thing is people have to look at this and say we've got to get
[01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:15.440]  food in now because exactly what you've been telling people is going to happen
[01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:19.320]  what you and I talked about we've got the perfect storm and those prices are
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:23.040]  starting just absolutely skyrocket and we thought they were bad before now
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:29.920]  they're absolutely insane and Steve the numbers I've seen are 47 million on
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:35.520]  full-time food stamps that are high-tech soup lines and then if you add in
[01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:40.440]  people that have supplemental income to pay for their food it's over 50 million
[01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:45.640]  are on some type of food assistance and then if you count the number of children
[01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:49.440]  on the school lunch program in fact I forget that number guys pull up school
[01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:54.040]  lunch program number of kids on it for me it's absolutely insane but I mean
[01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:57.960]  that's my point Steve that's my point here though Steve is that we're 30
[01:43:57.960 --> 01:44:01.960]  million or the we're 300 million people in this country and we're talking about
[01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:06.040]  50 million of them are already in electronic food lines and you've got
[01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:10.120]  all this global meltdown happening I only promote what I believe in and I
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:13.880]  think people need to call eFoodsDirect.com or go to eFoodsDirect.com's
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:18.040]  website and get your high-quality swarble food today because I remember you for
[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:21.800]  years telling listeners and this stuff lasts more than 10 years buy the food
[01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:26.360]  now before it goes up in price which it has and you'll be able to eat the food
[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:31.160]  later and save money and beat inflation and you've told me off-record that a lot
[01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:34.880]  of people call you now and actually you're out of work and stuff and are
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:38.760]  glad that they did buy food from you a few years ago well and the interesting
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:43.960]  thing is on the people on food stamps Alex those people are not unemployed a
[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:48.000]  high percentage of them are fully employed and they still can't afford
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:52.200]  the food so anytime they see any kind of an opportunity like if there's
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:56.640]  something like free shipping they need to take that money that they spend on
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:59.760]  shipping and putting in the more food anytime they get a chance to get a
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:04.360]  special or a deal of any sort that they can afford they need to grab it right
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:07.960]  now because that's the way things are going more and more people can't even
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:13.960]  afford the food and it's just getting it's getting more exacerbated as as this
[01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:17.520]  price increase keeps keep jumping up there well Steve I've said it over and
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:25.200]  over again a aunt colony stores food squirrel store food wolves will bury
[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:28.200]  part of the kill they don't eat in the snow and come back a month later and
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:33.640]  eat it it is a fundamental instinct to save food my grandparents did it on
[01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:39.480]  both sides but more and in the Great Depression major universities estimate
[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:43.480]  seven million people died of malnutrition and starvation over that
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:48.480]  decade 90% of people lived in rural areas and were somewhat self-sufficient
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:53.680]  now 90% right at 90 are urban effect I saw a number last month it's now 91%
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:46:00.080]  are urban so only 9% are on the land and half of those are self-sufficient we are
[01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:05.880]  on top of a incredible time bomb and I hope we dodge this bullet and we may but
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:09.400]  for a lot of people they haven't already it is important to get storeable food
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:14.000]  and for those that don't know one of the biggest cost of storeable food is the
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:17.400]  shipping even if you buy it at a local place it still had to be shipped there
[01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:21.360]  unless you can drive to where it's produced and pick it up there and this
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:26.560]  is even better than that this is free shipping which is a giant savings Steve
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:29.720]  tell folks about in the last few minutes we've got some of the different food
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:32.800]  plans you've got and the type of high-quality food we're talking about
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:38.360]  here well people can keep people can work with the small amounts whatever they
[01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:43.280]  need they can work with a three-month supply a six-month supply a lot of folks
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:47.240]  are working with the year supplies but one of the the most important things for
[01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:52.680]  folks right now are the are what we call the new traversal foods that that
[01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:56.800]  common little pouches that all they have to do is boil water a 10-year-old can
[01:46:56.800 --> 01:47:02.360]  fix all this food and it's completely free of the genetically modified stuff
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:06.200]  it doesn't have hydrogenated oil it's the cleanest food on the planet the best
[01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:12.200]  tasting food on the planet and literally it will store almost indefinitely we tell
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:17.240]  folks to use it within the first 15 years for best results and the fact is
[01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:21.120]  that people can put together whatever they can and put in a savings account and
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:25.800]  food that literally with with what's happening with precious metals and
[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:31.160]  things people are moving from from cash to precious metals and from precious
[01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:35.160]  metals to food right now that's the way things are going and that's the the way
[01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:41.640]  that the the world is is forcing people to be just for security well people need
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:47.480]  firearms they need emergency equipment emergency radios they need food they need
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:52.760]  water filters it's very simple we need to learn to not be dependent on government
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:58.080]  because government has proven in history it can't and it won't protect you and
[01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:01.760]  government itself as you know Steve has been buying up most of the food the
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:08.120]  emergency supplies out there driving up the prices the government is is is acting
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:12.320]  like they're digging in for Armageddon we know it's the financial collapse and
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:16.880]  so it's so important it's a win-win-win your sponsorship helps us get out the
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:21.760]  general word and information and also then helps educate people about high
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:26.640]  quality storeable foods and then they also aren't dependent on the system it's
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:31.920]  so important so the website is e the letter e foods direct comm big banners
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:36.840]  at info wars comm and prison planet comm and there's also the toll-free number
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:41.000]  that's up on screen for prison planet dot TV viewers radio listeners it's

[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:56.640]  absolutely wonderful that's perfect because I know you have a couple other
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:48:59.720]  numbers too but they all go to the same place again that number one more time
[01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:05.520]  folks is eight hundred eight seven six zero eight seven one eight hundred eight

[01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:28.400]  the different packages Steve well a lot of times people are saving literally
[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:33.000]  hundreds of hundreds of dollars because shipping has become as a result of the
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:37.520]  ethanol on the gas push and the cost of shipping the shipping awful oftentimes
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:42.520]  becomes 10 or 15 percent of the value that people are ordering and it's just
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:45.760]  absolutely insane that that people have to spend so much on shipping just to
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:50.720]  get the food there eight hundred eight seven six zero eight seven one are e

[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:10.240]  prices do not continue to go up I know you haven't had a price increase in a
[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:15.840]  long time are you gonna have to have a price increase soon we're we're working
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:21.640]  right now on inventories that we have contracted to to keep the price down I
[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:27.400]  know we'll be forced to fairly soon but the biggest thing is right now we've
[01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:30.920]  got the inventories people really need to get everything they can get their

[01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:20.240]  Jones on the GCN radio network you notice Herman Cain was in the single digits
[01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:26.200]  four or five percentage points until Ron Paul began to power surge and Perry
[01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:33.320]  began to fade in comes Cain now he can beat Obama we're told why he's the man
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:38.840]  so he can then fade off later and Obama will end up getting in there turns out
[01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:43.720]  he's backed by sculling bones put on the Federal Reserve board high-powered
[01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:47.840]  globalist and so we're gonna be at the bottom of the next hour talking about
[01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:54.520]  Herman Cain coming up Lone Star Diva in Texas you're on the air welcome hi Alex
[01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:59.600]  I haven't talked to you in a few years I have beat my brains against the wall for
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:02.960]  two months and I've come up with it with your kind of call to action to do
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:06.680]  something and I've come up with a simple action list to become a delegate and
[01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:11.640]  this is really the only way to get Ron Paul on the presidential ticket absolutely
[01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:15.040]  the devils in the details and that's where the globalists get us so we've
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:19.840]  got to get into the details okay I've emailed this to you and your team and
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:23.920]  I've also made a little video for YouTube that goes over this is five points I
[01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:27.920]  can read them off fairly yeah go ahead yeah because listen people people are
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:31.640]  used to call screener so what happens is people call me and then like want me to
[01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:37.160]  screen their call on there just just go ahead and hit the points okay number one
[01:55:37.160 --> 01:55:41.840]  be registered to vote 30 days prior to your primary election hours in Texas is
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:47.040]  March 6 vote in the primary make sure they stamp your voter registration card
[01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:51.960]  and also check for a listing on the wall at the poll when you go to vote for when
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:57.760]  the convention committee meets and it'll be that night probably number three go
[01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:01.960]  back that night when the polls close for the meeting which is usually at 7pm now
[01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:05.320]  and they may have posted that it's otherwise but it has to be within I
[01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:11.160]  think five days now for attend the precinct convention that's that night
[01:56:11.160 --> 01:56:15.640]  7pm could only be Europe 200 people depending on the size your precinct
[01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:20.080]  number five and I have a footnote with this one choose fellow Ron Paul
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:25.120]  supporters when voting for the precinct chair secretary sergeant in arms and
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:29.200]  most importantly the delegates to the county convention and their alternates
[01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:33.040]  number six you got a follow-through to ten the conventions you're selected for
[01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:36.160]  even if you're just an alternate that's going to cost you a three-day stay in
[01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:40.720]  hotels and start saving now the best way it should be is just say folks get out
[01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:44.600]  there and be Ron Paul delegates okay and then serious people that actually want
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:48.280]  to try to save this country in the world are going to go out and find out but
[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:53.360]  that is very exciting I appreciate I appreciate your call let's go ahead and
[01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:58.280]  go to another caller here I want to go quickly through these let's talk to Nick
[01:56:58.280 --> 01:57:07.640]  who's listening on KOMY 1340 a.m. in California welcome Nick I suppose it's
[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:12.840]  flatter to not report on Ron Paul that's the way it's portraying to me as these
[01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:18.040]  network guys are not saying him they might as well they might as well be
[01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:22.000]  taking off like a piece of cardboard no and he's given the least amount of time
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:28.680]  and in questions and in answers in the debates and they keep when they do talk
[01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:31.960]  about and they say you can't win which shows you he's the he's the guy to vote
[01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:39.720]  for um you know talking about comics um when you first introduced some do
[01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:46.440]  hers to me he was overriding some TSA bill um immediately Alex you there yes

[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:06.040]  talking about all morning about nobody did anything about and now we're in
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:12.680]  consequential no how how he could even know what we do you know is go back not
[01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:18.680]  a hundred years like Naomi says and say their actions but just study the

[02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:49.160]  I'm talking about Herman Cain also it's pretty big news that Jesse Ventura
[02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:54.480]  announced here he would like to run as the VP with Ron Paul that's a pretty big
[02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:59.520]  deal pretty newsworthy that articles up at info wars.com former governor calls
[02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:04.160]  for Paul Ventura ticket I'm gonna get into that it's gonna be a jam packed third
[02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:10.160]  hour right now let's continue with your ring of denies let's talk to Reverend
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:18.480]  Bruce in New York come on down Reverend God bless you my wonderful radio
[02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:22.560]  personality I still keep you in prayer for safety well thank you I need those
[02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:27.200]  prayers I covered them all right I just have a couple of questions a couple of
[02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:32.640]  comments and I'll be brief the first thing is are you thinking about even
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:36.640]  considering that whenever the Bilderbergs are in town or close by like
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:40.840]  neighboring Canada or somewhere here that you get a bus together and get some
[02:01:40.840 --> 02:01:44.600]  folks like me and other people to come with you to rally in front of those
[02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:49.440]  meetings that's a good idea if we had the money we do have an RV now but it
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:53.720]  didn't really set up like a bus the problem is I spent all my time trying to
[02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:56.760]  raise the money to pay for this operation they don't have any time to
[02:01:56.760 --> 02:02:00.480]  actually go on the trips themselves but I'm working on at least every two months
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:05.320]  going to three or four cities a because I want to meet people and get the word
[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:10.320]  out that way and be I never get out of Austin so we're working on that right
[02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:15.320]  now and yes if I can get into Canada because they are set to every four years
[02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:19.100]  it's in North America but they split it it'll be in Canada one year every four
[02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:24.800]  years it's only in the US to be technical every eight years and four years
[02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:31.240]  ago when Obama was being selected or three and a half years ago it was in
[02:02:31.240 --> 02:02:37.680]  Virginia in Chantilly and I was there so if it's in Canada I am going to have
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:42.560]  to probably not even announce I'm going and then probably try to get in on the
[02:02:42.560 --> 02:02:47.800]  west side of Canada even though the east sides where they'll meet because I've
[02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:52.080]  confirmed in the French Canada I'm in the computer band and I've learned that
[02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:56.680]  if you get banned there and federally it that the that they'll still let you in
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:03:02.280]  on the west side it's it's very weird I'm told it's more English style I'm not
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:05.720]  bashing the French I'm not a francophone like a lot of people but I mean
[02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:11.960]  they they are famous in France and in other French protectorates of just being
[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:15.520]  really mean at customs and I am in their database and do not want to
[02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:20.280]  experience 15 hours of being cussed out again I'm sorry go ahead well if you if
[02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:23.920]  you were to get a bus people would pay you know like you got a bus trip you
[02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:28.280]  know it's good people can get buses get a bus trip pay for their own tickets their
[02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:33.000]  own way and meet you there I mean it's something no I agree listen I tried it
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:37.560]  this year we said March on Bilderberg and I'm told about 500 people showed up and
[02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:41.760]  they did St. Moritz that was in the middle of nowhere you know in the fog
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:48.840]  shrouded Alps windy roads three hours from any big town and over the couple
[02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:53.320]  days was more like a thousand showed up and I had my crew there so yes if it's
[02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:57.520]  in a more populated area you bet your bottom dollar that we but they're
[02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:02.920]  listening you know that soon want to have their meetings in Antarctica anything
[02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:10.520]  else okay my next thing and my comment is this have you considered about because
[02:04:10.520 --> 02:04:15.600]  it's hard to get through to you on the phone having like a live Twitter people
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:20.840]  could tweet your questions or even on your own red page have a live a tweet so
[02:04:20.840 --> 02:04:25.080]  you can answer questions from live tweets you know what we're talking about
[02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:29.840]  doing a mailbag segment from emails and tweets every night on the news nightly
[02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:33.120]  news and here but I would have to be organized then and then I'm not very
[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:37.880]  organized not not my cruise fault mainly my fault and I have done live chats
[02:04:37.880 --> 02:04:42.960]  before I I post a tweet 20 people comment like a minute so even if I do that it
[02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:46.320]  would be hard to answer the questions but I tell you what Twitter means some
[02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:52.680]  questions right now at real Alex Jones forward slash it's Twitter.com forward
[02:04:52.680 --> 02:04:59.000]  slash Alex Jones all right thank you whatever Twitter.com forward slash real
[02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:05.240]  Alex Jones what did I say a very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we
[02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:09.680]  will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years he says it
[02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:13.800]  will change everything about our lives the way you shop travel invest educate
[02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:17.200]  your children and even how you take care of your health and your own family now
[02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:20.600]  this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years the crazy
[02:05:20.600 --> 02:05:24.680]  part is he's usually right you see he predicted the collapse of GM
[02:05:24.680 --> 02:05:27.880]  Panny Mae, Freddie Mac and America's biggest small owner general growth

[02:07:57.080 --> 02:08:06.000]  prison planet dot TV he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN
[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:25.000]  radio network okay we got a lot of breaking news I'm gonna break down on
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:29.680]  Herman Kane we're gonna have Aaron Dixon there give you a boil down on him at
[02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:33.800]  the bottom of the hour we're also gonna get into former governor Jesse Ventura
[02:08:33.800 --> 02:08:40.400]  calls for Paul Ventura ticket and he agreed with me that if Ron Paul doesn't
[02:08:40.400 --> 02:08:43.720]  win which he has a really good chance of doing despite all the hoaxing and
[02:08:43.720 --> 02:08:49.280]  skullduggery and scams that are going on the Tom Fullery that if he doesn't
[02:08:49.280 --> 02:08:53.560]  win the Republican nomination and we'll know that in four months we'll know
[02:08:53.560 --> 02:09:00.440]  that well before the Texas primary in March we'll know in we'll know by March
[02:09:00.440 --> 02:09:05.720]  so four or five months from now it'll be really clear in three or four months I
[02:09:05.720 --> 02:09:12.960]  mean if he's a shoe in it'll be a real fight from that point on but to stay in
[02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:17.120]  the game to keep real issues in there to force his way into the debate which
[02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:21.320]  scares the establishment to death between Obama and Mitt Romney or whoever
[02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:27.320]  gets up there or Herman Kane and you imagine Ron Paul up there he's got to do
[02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:33.040]  it it is his responsibility and I want to make it clear Ron Paul is not allowed
[02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:37.960]  to ride off in the sunset despite all this hard work if he loses this and then
[02:09:37.960 --> 02:09:43.560]  he goes off to be the kind of the Omni Budsman or the honorable Gandalf type
[02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:50.920]  advisor to the Liberty Movement we need him to go in through and beyond and go
[02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:59.200]  into that debate go into that general election and I am saying draft him now
[02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:02.960]  now this gets misunderstood this gets spun I saw articles last night and
[02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:07.040]  emails I got going Alex Jones is saying that Ron Paul's to drop out of the
[02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:11.560]  Republican Party and should run as libertarian that is not what I'm saying
[02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:16.560]  that is repeat not what I'm saying Jesse Ventura is so sick of the two parties
[02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:20.800]  I was able to beat them in Minnesota which is a real upset back in 98 as
[02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:27.520]  you know that he's in love with the idea of Alex the two parties it's a two-party
[02:10:27.520 --> 02:10:32.360]  dictatorship Alex and I see his point but to use the apparatus of the
[02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:37.480]  Republican Party the primary system Ron Paul's doing the right thing I mean
[02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:40.360]  there was a guy running as a Democrat like Ron Paul I'd be a Democrat
[02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:46.480]  supporting him yes the parties are a joke at the federal level when anybody
[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:54.280]  else but Ron Paul and a few others but he's a real guy so stay in try to win he
[02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:57.480]  would be the front-runner of the water all these dirty tricks we can take out
[02:10:57.480 --> 02:11:00.440]  the other two candidates politically with the issues we have look at Perry
[02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:06.760]  already falling behind up comes Herman Kane what did Perry do Perry tried to
[02:11:06.760 --> 02:11:12.240]  become a Ron Paul clone blew up in his face even worse because not only was he
[02:11:12.240 --> 02:11:16.920]  not a Ron Paul but he was the opposite that's now Perry could come back again
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:21.360]  he's kind of out of the spotlight now because of the trouncing and the open
[02:11:21.360 --> 02:11:25.320]  borders promotion and the carbon taxes and the Al Gore and Hillary Care loving
[02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:30.120]  all of that hurting bad but we have all that on Mitt Romney as well that's how
[02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:33.320]  bad these guys are of course they're globalist I mean who is the media
[02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:39.400]  promoting so now they're sending in a Herman Kane to imitate Ron Paul now he
[02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:49.600]  isn't he doesn't have as much dirt he doesn't have as much dirt as McCain you
[02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:57.920]  know did four years ago or as somebody like a Mitt Romney today or a Rudolph
[02:11:57.920 --> 02:12:01.040]  Giuliani I mean those guys are all jokes from from the past or a new
[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:05.320]  Gennrich but he's still bad news and that's coming up ever some calls
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:10.000]  regardless though here's what I'm saying if Ron Paul doesn't get that
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:18.640]  nomination I will guarantee you I will guarantee you he could form the Liberty
[02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:23.920]  party or if he wanted to have the libertarians have it chosen there hey
[02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:28.760]  look up when they have the libertarian presidential caucus when they have that
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:33.240]  big event and picked a presidential candidate with their delegates look up
[02:12:33.240 --> 02:12:39.320]  when they did that in 2008 for me when did the libertarians choose Bob Barr
[02:12:39.800 --> 02:12:43.760]  because I was I meant to look that up last night the point is I know it comes
[02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:48.000]  later than the beginning of the general primaries and caucuses so if it didn't
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:53.000]  looking good for Ron Paul in March and he starts you know going to these other
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:59.720]  states and you know they're announcing in Texas Ron Paul only got you know 20
[02:12:59.720 --> 02:13:03.120]  percent of the votes which you know it's a fraud if that happens this guy is a
[02:13:03.120 --> 02:13:06.840]  elected by the biggest margin of anybody in Congress from Texas 80 something
[02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:12.520]  percent the old days it was 60 something he got I think it was 81% some
[02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:17.040]  ridiculous number it wasn't the last time the time before if he doesn't win
[02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:22.160]  and smash Rick Perry Rick Perry the last two times has not gone elected it in a
[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:29.560]  two-way race he has to have three ways to win a split bifurcated or I guess the
[02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:40.480]  word you'd use is the point is he can't win that way Rick Perry so I expect if
[02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:46.280]  there's not massive election fraud or Ron Paul to be a major contender but we
[02:13:46.280 --> 02:13:50.320]  know there's gonna be the fraud so we stay in the game by bringing up the real
[02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:55.040]  issues he runs as a libertarian or if they don't want him or that's already
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:14:01.680]  chosen as the new Liberty Party and Ron Paul gives him a big run to to add real
[02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:06.160]  issues and to represent America and our constitutional ideas that's what I want
[02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:09.440]  I'm gonna be putting articles out the next week or so in infowars.com
[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:14.560]  principle.com promoting that need to stay focused now on the Republican
[02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:20.120]  primaries but we need to increase our financial giving and spreading the word
[02:14:20.120 --> 02:14:25.800]  but also getting the idea going that hey if Ron Paul doesn't even win this
[02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:31.000]  primary or he starts losing doesn't matter we're gonna get him to run as a
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:36.560]  third party that way everybody doesn't get dejected and freaked out if he
[02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:42.160]  doesn't win everybody's ready to go to plan B which is operation inject the
[02:14:42.160 --> 02:14:46.120]  truth now obviously Ron Paul can't come out and do this now or they'll say you're
[02:14:46.120 --> 02:14:48.920]  not even really a Republican why are you even up here which they've already tried
[02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:51.680]  to do they tried to keep him out of debates last time and this time saying
[02:14:51.680 --> 02:14:55.000]  he's not a Republican you're not pro war and pro torture and you don't want to
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:58.640]  bankrupt the country you're actually like a founding father in your positions
[02:14:58.640 --> 02:15:04.640]  you're not fit to be a one of us scum you're too good to be one of us well
[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:09.360]  you're not a skull and bones minion like Herman Cain get out of here so he'll have
[02:15:09.360 --> 02:15:14.000]  to wait but we should start building that idea now so that if Ron Paul chooses
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:19.800]  that happens or some other candidate at that time gets ready to jump in we're
[02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:24.360]  still a year and a half out or a little less from the election you guys find out
[02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:29.920]  when they selected the libertarians our last presidential candidate Bob Barr
[02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:34.580]  I thought that's weird just look at the libertarian party website when they have
[02:15:34.580 --> 02:15:42.240]  older caucus July 3rd to 7th wow that gives us a long time then if Ron Paul
[02:15:42.240 --> 02:15:45.600]  doesn't win in these primaries there you go that's what I thought I thought it
[02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:51.080]  was in the summer so there you go he doesn't win the big states in March he
[02:15:51.080 --> 02:15:55.360]  just activates the Liberty Committee activates all that money the money will
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:16:00.000]  pour in and we're off of the races and he can make what we saw happen with Ross
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:05.680]  Perot look like nothing I'm telling you I'm telling you that's where we need to
[02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:09.320]  go with this I normally stay out of Ron Paul's business and just supporting but
[02:16:09.320 --> 02:16:12.440]  you know we've heard me on air telling me gotta run you gotta run you heard me
[02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:15.440]  tell Rand Paul I told Rand Paul privately I said you're gonna win buddy
[02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:19.320]  boy he's like I don't know at least we'll be able to bring up real issues and I
[02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:24.040]  said no you build it they will come they took some arm twisting by myself and
[02:16:24.040 --> 02:16:27.520]  many others yeah there it is the Libertarian National Convention is
[02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:31.080]  scheduled to be held in Las Vegas May 4th and 6th they've moved it back a
[02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:35.520]  month earlier let me see March April May so we got two months there no
[02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:43.240]  Rob limo Ron Paul in March or even April if he's not clearly gonna win those
[02:16:43.240 --> 02:16:48.560]  primaries they're all boom he jumps out and I think that's already going on
[02:16:48.560 --> 02:16:52.320]  because he already announced he's gonna retire from the house so they can't give
[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:55.800]  him this thing of well then you can't be a Republican to run on the Republican
[02:16:55.800 --> 02:17:03.200]  ticket in the state of Texas to use that apparatus to win so he knows so he can
[02:17:03.200 --> 02:17:06.920]  just say well fine I'm now switching to independent Libertarian in my last year
[02:17:06.920 --> 02:17:12.800]  here in the house and boom I'm telling you I'm telling it's gonna happen I'm
[02:17:12.800 --> 02:17:16.320]  telling you it's beautiful we hope he gets the Republican nomination but we
[02:17:16.320 --> 02:17:22.720]  don't give up if he doesn't a real expert on this is Richard Reeves he's
[02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:26.440]  been a delegate and everything else in a grassroots fighter hey in fact I want
[02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:29.400]  him in the last five minutes of the show today to give me his take on this I
[02:17:29.400 --> 02:17:31.920]  haven't even brought this up to him yet I've been thinking about it for months
[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:34.680]  but now we're getting into the zone here okay I'm gonna shut up let's go to your
[02:17:34.680 --> 02:17:42.840]  calls here who's up next to you CJ in Michigan you're on the year go ahead hey
[02:17:42.840 --> 02:17:50.320]  Alex yeah I got some interesting news here from Michigan two weeks ago Tuesday
[02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:56.080]  before last he had Kurt Haskell on the nightly news and strange and rare thing
[02:17:56.080 --> 02:18:01.360]  happened just before he came on in Monroe Michigan there was a car bomb that
[02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:07.720]  went off now what's really strange is Monroe Michigan is a stone throws away
[02:18:07.720 --> 02:18:14.280]  from Taylor Mitch Michigan which mr. Haskell has offices there and then the
[02:18:14.280 --> 02:18:22.560]  car bomb went off in a lawyer's car a mr. Eric Schaff yeah I remember the car
[02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:26.320]  bombing right around the time he came on here as well I know he's been talking
[02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:31.360]  about the fake trial and the underwear bombers own lawyers who he's fired and
[02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:36.800]  the standby lawyers as well have told Haskell that it's a that it's you're
[02:18:36.800 --> 02:18:40.800]  basically an inside operation and they think it's a setup and that Natal has
[02:18:40.800 --> 02:18:44.960]  been threatened or something which is standard and and yeah I saw that that it
[02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:48.920]  was a lawyer's car are you saying they might have blown up the wrong guy's car
[02:18:48.920 --> 02:18:55.080]  because let me tell you if they're gonna kill anybody it's Kurt Haskell I Google
[02:18:55.080 --> 02:18:59.240]  both your names together and they come up on a court docket which is you know
[02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:04.640]  like a schedule so obviously they frequent the same places they're real
[02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:08.920]  close proximity listen I believe in coincidences but I don't believe in three
[02:19:08.920 --> 02:19:13.680]  coincidences okay it's very rare first of all the US to have a car bomb and then
[02:19:13.680 --> 02:19:18.320]  it's a it's a lawyer's car then it's 20 miles away from a guy that's saying you
[02:19:18.320 --> 02:19:24.200]  know this you've got evidence that the US may be complicit in the you know I
[02:19:24.200 --> 02:19:27.900]  forget the details because it got almost no attention and and when it's an
[02:19:27.900 --> 02:19:32.160]  inside job as I said today it happened you don't see a lot of coverage if this
[02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:35.360]  had been something that they were staging like the Times Square thing it'd
[02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:39.720]  be hyperventilating for six weeks you know what write up your points and send
[02:19:39.720 --> 02:19:44.920]  it to show tips info wars calm and I'll run it by Kurt Haskell maybe in fact

[02:24:15.240 --> 02:24:19.160]  okay Richard Reeves is not in the office right now but he will be popping in
[02:24:19.160 --> 02:24:28.520]  via Skype from one of our other hidden locations in the last five minutes of the show today
[02:24:30.280 --> 02:24:33.560]  he's actually here in the office i want to do a Skype test when we go on the road
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:39.240]  i don't usually misspeak i'm like he's not in the office he's not going to be in this office
[02:24:39.240 --> 02:24:43.960]  he's me back there in the corner office doing a Skype test so instead of being in studio we'll
[02:24:43.960 --> 02:24:48.600]  just have him over Skype from the other side of the building testing it out for when i'm on the
[02:24:48.600 --> 02:24:54.360]  road with our new little Skype box little laptop we got so we'll see how that looks or are we going
[02:24:54.360 --> 02:25:00.920]  to plug in an outside better camera when i'm on the road that's another issue because the camera
[02:25:00.920 --> 02:25:04.920]  we have in here looks a lot better than just using the laptop camera have we thought about that
[02:25:05.800 --> 02:25:13.800]  okay side issue doesn't matter i want to get to otter and gary and bill and others
[02:25:13.800 --> 02:25:20.280]  that are holding but uh cj finishing up your point yeah i just wanted to give my two cents
[02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:25.640]  their suggestion on the info word you know so many things happen locally that that doesn't
[02:25:25.640 --> 02:25:30.840]  hit the national radar is there you know i could email you or call your office phone but you
[02:25:30.840 --> 02:25:36.600]  probably get so many that it's hard to get something hot and now it's just information overload
[02:25:37.240 --> 02:25:40.920]  and i've got nothing but pure work i mean last night my wife calls him says can you come to
[02:25:40.920 --> 02:25:45.880]  internet seven and i said maybe then she called him at seven she said you're not here and i said
[02:25:45.880 --> 02:25:49.880]  i said no i'm doing the show live some nights to do it take some nights i do it live i said i'm
[02:25:49.880 --> 02:25:55.960]  doing nightly news live i got behind it's live and i'm like i gotta go on tv and then it becomes a
[02:25:55.960 --> 02:26:01.800]  whole issue of just having no live show no uh just send us emails we catch most of it i appreciate
[02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:08.920]  your call uh david california you're on the air go ahead alex you are in maverick and you do the
[02:26:08.920 --> 02:26:16.520]  state of texas proud um wanted to talk about two points if you don't mind first is uh kim trails
[02:26:17.240 --> 02:26:24.040]  you are on that issue on your uh documentation because they are blasting us over here somebody
[02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:31.000]  right now it's horrible people can't breathe people are getting sick it's a real real deal no
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:36.200]  they admit it's killin the plants too and uh they were back in the news today admitting that government
[02:26:36.200 --> 02:26:41.880]  is geoengineering and i saw a natural news story yesterday where people are now in hawaii filing
[02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:46.600]  suit over it but there's no doubt the aluminum levels going up they're killing us meanwhile
[02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:53.720]  they've got all the environmentalists scared of carbon dioxide twisted but you're doing everyone
[02:26:53.720 --> 02:26:59.640]  proud to you know keep sharing the truth the other thing is basically my plan to save our country
[02:26:59.640 --> 02:27:07.320]  okay the republic and it's not my plan it was kfk's plan which was executive order 11110
[02:27:07.960 --> 02:27:16.680]  and he wrote that it backed us treasury not federal reserve with silver silver certificates
[02:27:16.680 --> 02:27:23.080]  and i believe that's why kennedy was assassinated and all of the debt has been created since that
[02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:31.240]  day and it's as you know a way to control us but it has never been repealed and uh this executive
[02:27:31.240 --> 02:27:41.400]  order 11110 with silver under 30 right now it's trading at 29 my 50 it's they're crashing us
[02:27:42.280 --> 02:27:49.720]  this can save our country so i hope ron paul gets this message or jesse ventura and they back our
[02:27:49.720 --> 02:27:57.960]  us treasury the taxpayers our our money well david ron paul has written about that executive order
[02:27:57.960 --> 02:28:03.800]  that issued it was going to be 50 billion but only five billion got out of uh five dollar bills
[02:28:03.800 --> 02:28:08.040]  that have the red stamp their collector iteming bound for about 15 bucks well since i've talked
[02:28:08.040 --> 02:28:12.520]  about them we're like 50 bucks i've seen them selling for uh but there's limited circulation
[02:28:12.520 --> 02:28:18.680]  there they're lincoln greenbacks that he reissued he was going to start uh balancing the federal reserve
[02:28:18.680 --> 02:28:23.480]  and taking the power of the purse back to the congress uh and they killed him that was the main
[02:28:23.480 --> 02:28:29.560]  thing that was the last straw and ron paul does want to abolish the fed he said let's audit it first
[02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:34.120]  but he says well i want to get rid of it and and look herman kane was not just on the board of
[02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:38.760]  directors of the federal reserve i i have erin coming up and i know all this stuff but i like
[02:28:38.760 --> 02:28:43.480]  to always double check it before i say it to make sure i'm right because sometimes my memory
[02:28:43.480 --> 02:28:49.160]  you know yesterday i was saying the uh epa says melamine didn't bad for kids and the guys couldn't
[02:28:49.160 --> 02:28:54.120]  find it and they said no no no alex it's fda and i'm like oh of course yeah food drug administration
[02:28:54.120 --> 02:28:59.880]  says it's good for you in my memory can twist things erin went and pulled it he was not only on
[02:28:59.880 --> 02:29:09.800]  the board of directors he was the the director of the second most powerful federal reserve branch
[02:29:09.800 --> 02:29:14.600]  bank the new york feds the most powerful the one he was part of is the second most powerful
[02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:21.400]  i mean herman kane is super insider i mean he is like henry kissinger minion level
[02:29:21.400 --> 02:29:27.800]  head of all these big national associations i mean and he's slick he's smart and he's super
[02:29:27.800 --> 02:29:35.480]  bad news and i heard uh what's his name neil boards last week they rear him at night locally
[02:29:35.480 --> 02:29:40.040]  defending herman kane with his programs people like neil we thought you were going to get rid
[02:29:40.040 --> 02:29:43.960]  of the income tax and then give us a sales tax because like well we've got to have them both

[02:37:26.200 --> 02:37:30.920]  planet.com it's important to get out to people we've pretty much started the destruction of
[02:37:30.920 --> 02:37:36.680]  rick perry with his horrible record i mean it was too much for even neocon ryan knows that he was
[02:37:36.680 --> 02:37:42.600]  algor's former chief of staff in texas and then in 93 94 supported hillary care it was too much
[02:37:43.720 --> 02:37:48.680]  for people that he supported gun control it was too much for people that he for supported force
[02:37:48.680 --> 02:37:54.200]  inoculations and handing 8 000 miles of roads over to foreign companies to turn existing roads
[02:37:54.200 --> 02:38:00.280]  into toll roads it goes on and on the sanctuary cities were the end of it and the free tuition
[02:38:00.280 --> 02:38:04.920]  you know the in-state tuition that other americans don't get free legals and that the majority of the
[02:38:04.920 --> 02:38:12.040]  jobs 81 were to immigrants most of the illegals 93 that was too much and you know the snake
[02:38:12.040 --> 02:38:17.240]  hadn't dead politically yet he's not completely dead but he's damaged and floundering around
[02:38:17.240 --> 02:38:21.400]  we know we've got him and he looks totally freaked out and like the air was sucked out of him
[02:38:21.400 --> 02:38:26.040]  narcissists like that don't do well when they're attacked i love being attacked it helps me because
[02:38:26.040 --> 02:38:30.680]  i know i'm in the right okay people take my aggression everything for narcissism it's the
[02:38:30.680 --> 02:38:36.280]  opposite this is savage hatred of tyranny and a lust for life and justice that's what you see here
[02:38:36.280 --> 02:38:40.200]  but somebody like perry i saw him on the news last night again this morning boy he looks like a
[02:38:40.200 --> 02:38:44.600]  he looks like a zombie he suddenly looks 20 years older looks like everything's been sucked out of
[02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:52.840]  him because he knows he knows he knows he's coming to the end of his road now somebody else playing
[02:38:52.840 --> 02:38:59.080]  the sympathy card and all this garbage is herman kane and we're gonna get him too and we're gonna get
[02:38:59.080 --> 02:39:05.320]  mit romney because even if they cheat don't let ron paul get in we're still gonna destroy their
[02:39:05.320 --> 02:39:10.760]  puppets just like we destroyed obama he is a dead political duck up there rotting in front of everyone
[02:39:10.760 --> 02:39:18.120]  now herman kane describes ron paul supporters concerns as stupid we actually have a video clip
[02:39:18.120 --> 02:39:22.200]  that erin has gotten together we ought to add that up on the site remember seeing this a while back
[02:39:22.200 --> 02:39:26.360]  where he says it's stupid we want to audit the private fellow reserve you know congress keeps
[02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:30.360]  asking where the trillions go and you've seen that vernac you say i'm not going to tell you
[02:39:30.360 --> 02:39:34.520]  i'm not going to tell you well where did the trillions go i'm not going to tell you now we
[02:39:34.520 --> 02:39:40.360]  know to foreign banks to foreign individuals to globalists to warren buffet the people like that
[02:39:41.880 --> 02:39:47.800]  now herman kane who's been pushing for 15 years which i learned 15 years ago the republican party
[02:39:47.800 --> 02:39:52.120]  in the federal reserve and the democratic party were all involved in the fair tax movement you
[02:39:52.120 --> 02:39:56.200]  want to get mad at me for being right sorry and i've told you for 15 years i learned about this
[02:39:56.200 --> 02:40:01.480]  a year into being on air and was promoting it and a guy brought me documents and met me outside and
[02:40:01.480 --> 02:40:06.040]  said alex this is a setup they're going to keep the income tax here's the foundations promoting it
[02:40:06.040 --> 02:40:10.440]  they're just going to change the name of the income tax to saying it's for social security only
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:16.680]  like 10 or so and then they'll give you a vat and a sales tax on top of it and not get rid of it
[02:40:16.680 --> 02:40:21.160]  and i and i went with that and was criticized for 15 years herman kane has now come out and said
[02:40:22.280 --> 02:40:26.040]  the plan is that we're going to have a nine percent tax over here and nine over here and
[02:40:26.040 --> 02:40:32.440]  nine over here and we're going to keep the income tax and i've heard neil borts defending this
[02:40:32.440 --> 02:40:38.520]  mr fair tax i mean i told you i'm right again not because i'm smart but because i research
[02:40:39.320 --> 02:40:44.840]  okay i told you and we're going to go into herman kane's real background here in a moment i want
[02:40:44.840 --> 02:40:48.760]  you to get this audio get this video you're watching and listening to get this prison
[02:40:48.760 --> 02:40:52.760]  planet dot tv archive and get out to everybody because we've got to now move into into destroying
[02:40:52.760 --> 02:40:58.840]  herman kane and mitt romney like i told you i don't spend much time on obama as bad as he is
[02:40:58.840 --> 02:41:04.280]  he's been given dictatorial power but he is politically destroyed now so he flounders around
[02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:09.800]  it's these new cats we got to worry about because people haven't figured them out yet
[02:41:09.800 --> 02:41:13.240]  people can have this little hope they're going to save them they haven't done the research on them
[02:41:14.120 --> 02:41:19.160]  we've got cyanide tablets politically for them we need to make sure they take their medicine
[02:41:19.160 --> 02:41:25.400]  okay we've given perry his medicine he ain't looking too good is he he's he go maniacs don't
[02:41:25.400 --> 02:41:32.200]  look too good when they're burning up burning down so we're going to give herman kane his medicine
[02:41:32.200 --> 02:41:36.920]  we're going to give mid romney his medicine already given obama and rick perry their medicine
[02:41:36.920 --> 02:41:41.480]  and if that didn't didn't didn't fully bring them down we're going to give more medicine
[02:41:41.480 --> 02:41:46.360]  but right now we've got to move on to those that haven't been given the first round of patriot
[02:41:46.360 --> 02:41:53.000]  truth their real record medicine are you going to help me give them their medicine let's give it to them
[02:41:55.240 --> 02:42:00.360]  fire it will let's go ahead and go to this clip here's some medicine for herman kane
[02:42:01.320 --> 02:42:06.440]  some people say that we ought to audit the federal reserve here's what i do know the
[02:42:06.440 --> 02:42:12.920]  federal reserve already has so many internal audience audits is ridiculous i don't know where
[02:42:12.920 --> 02:42:18.440]  why people think we're going to learn this great amount of information by auditing the
[02:42:18.440 --> 02:42:23.320]  federal reserve now i no longer serve on the border the federal reserve i'm not being defensive of
[02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:27.800]  the federal reserve in fact some of the policies and some of the actions of the federal reserve
[02:42:27.800 --> 02:42:35.880]  today i don't agree with because the the the attitude and the the non politicization of the
[02:42:35.880 --> 02:42:40.040]  federal reserve in the nineties when i served on it is totally different than what's going on today
[02:42:40.040 --> 02:42:44.200]  but that's another matter but people who say well we ought to audit the federal reserve because we
[02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:48.680]  don't know enough about it well here's the advice i've given the people who are worried about an
[02:42:48.680 --> 02:42:55.640]  audit of the federal reserve call them up and ask them if you can stop by and have one of their
[02:42:55.640 --> 02:43:01.080]  pr people or one of their public relations people explain to you how the federal reserve operates
[02:43:01.640 --> 02:43:05.400]  i think a lot of people are calling for this audit of the federal reserve
[02:43:05.400 --> 02:43:12.360]  because they don't know enough about it there's no hidden secrets going on in the federal reserve
[02:43:12.360 --> 02:43:18.520]  to my knowledge and i tell people you know we've got 12 federal reserve banks you find out which
[02:43:18.520 --> 02:43:26.280]  district you in call them up and go from there we don't need to waste money with another commission
[02:43:26.280 --> 02:43:31.800]  or an audit that's not necessary okay and you can tell that was on the neil boards program when he
[02:43:31.800 --> 02:43:39.080]  was filling in now let's stop right there i gotta do a news piece on this the next few days showing
[02:43:39.080 --> 02:43:43.800]  where congress can't find out where the money went and when they did they learned hundreds of
[02:43:43.800 --> 02:43:49.160]  millions went to msnvc to have rachel maddowell sit up there and demonize the founding fathers and
[02:43:49.160 --> 02:43:58.680]  ron paul now here's the deal when he was on there in the 1990s is when the dark lord himself was
[02:43:58.680 --> 02:44:03.560]  heading it up and that of course is howling grainspan who got rid of glass steagle and allowed the
[02:44:03.560 --> 02:44:14.360]  creation of the 1.5 quadrillion that's 1500 trillion that they claim we owe even though we
[02:44:14.360 --> 02:44:24.360]  never got any of that money okay so i mean i have never heard such absolute bull glad handing
[02:44:24.360 --> 02:44:30.760]  garbage in my life the only good thing about herman kane is no matter what audience he's
[02:44:30.760 --> 02:44:34.520]  in front of he talks the same with obama he's in front of a bunch of white people who get up
[02:44:34.520 --> 02:44:39.080]  there and go hi guys good to see you here it's like i want you to black comedian do an imitation
[02:44:39.080 --> 02:44:44.840]  of a white person well how you doing there my name's urkel and then when he gets up in front of
[02:44:44.840 --> 02:44:50.040]  black folks like i'm a rug obama i like basketball we're gonna do a special on that tonight's like
[02:44:50.040 --> 02:44:56.520]  hillary clinton in kentucky goes from her yankee accent to like bear with you today i mean look i
[02:44:56.520 --> 02:45:02.280]  don't just get off on hating on people herman kane is a slick corporate salesman and everybody's
[02:45:02.280 --> 02:45:05.800]  like wow he knows how to run private business let's get him in there well he knows how to run the
[02:45:05.800 --> 02:45:11.000]  fellow reserve we need to get rid of the fellow reserve that we didn't have until 1913 97 years
[02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:18.440]  ago we need to get rid of it we don't need a former fellow reserve head of their second most
[02:45:18.440 --> 02:45:24.040]  powerful branch in control erin dykes give us a report on this and we'll document cam over there
[02:45:24.040 --> 02:45:29.400]  where you're at as well so people can see the articles you've got breakdown lord kane for us
[02:45:29.400 --> 02:45:35.480]  look as a politician he's being sold as another phony outsider independent not true he owes his
[02:45:35.480 --> 02:45:40.680]  whole career to the skull and bones pillsbury cartel family and that's not an independent
[02:45:40.680 --> 02:45:44.600]  business that destroys independent business contributes to bad health and all the rest of
[02:45:44.600 --> 02:45:49.640]  it and pillsbury is total pimp level they're right at the top but remember in 2008 uh presidential
[02:45:49.640 --> 02:45:55.400]  race john mccain didn't have a pulse he didn't even show up in the polls until juliani uh dropped
[02:45:55.400 --> 02:46:00.200]  out then suddenly he rose to prominence they have these people waiting in the wings palins waiting
[02:46:00.200 --> 02:46:04.600]  in the wings people like herman kane are waiting in the wings if they can't sell perry and the
[02:46:04.600 --> 02:46:11.240]  rest of them now herman kane himself started at the department of the navy then worked for the
[02:46:11.240 --> 02:46:16.680]  by the way that's where they get their top minions uh is is out of the navy and they they sheet
[02:46:16.680 --> 02:46:21.160]  department of intelligence from that that that's a big big point right there that's right then he
[02:46:21.160 --> 02:46:27.640]  worked for the coca-cola company as a business totally selected then starting in 1977 he joined
[02:46:27.640 --> 02:46:34.600]  pillsbury rising to vice president in the early 80s then they moved him to burger king of pillsbury
[02:46:34.600 --> 02:46:39.880]  subsidiary that's healthy for black people then well everyone of course but i mean you know the
[02:46:39.880 --> 02:46:46.760]  perception then he became ceo of godfather's pizza also a pillsbury company uh then pillsbury
[02:46:46.760 --> 02:46:51.480]  sold off their interest there's mergers there's inside baseball and that the point is he rose
[02:46:51.480 --> 02:46:57.320]  to business prominence through the pillsbury cartel who are uh established founding members of the
[02:46:57.320 --> 02:47:02.520]  skull and bones in our research they're right up there at the top uh now now getting the big point
[02:47:02.520 --> 02:47:07.720]  though he wasn't just on the board of a regional fed he was the director tell him that yeah first
[02:47:07.720 --> 02:47:13.400]  he was deputy director then he was actual director for a total of five years while he was simultaneously
[02:47:13.400 --> 02:47:17.800]  still godfather pizza ceo so that's independent business for you working for the federal and
[02:47:17.800 --> 02:47:22.120]  again tell him what branch he was the head of yeah at kansas city and you heard in the clip or he
[02:47:22.120 --> 02:47:26.600]  says just call him up go down there ask him what they're doing they almost had me arrested for
[02:47:26.600 --> 02:47:31.800]  filming not even on their property from you know like you say a hundred yards away at that park
[02:47:31.800 --> 02:47:35.720]  you're more than a hundred yards yeah at the kansas they come up with hands on their guns
[02:47:35.720 --> 02:47:39.720]  you said we're not doing anything they said go we're gonna you know yeah so call them up and
[02:47:39.720 --> 02:47:44.120]  then even though it was on the news the newspaper quoted the the federal reserve is saying they
[02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:48.520]  didn't do that remember that they were just implied we don't do that we didn't do that but
[02:47:48.520 --> 02:47:53.480]  though those security officers who almost poses police you should have you know i told you guys
[02:47:53.480 --> 02:47:56.680]  not to get arrested but you should have just gotten arrested and sued them like dude's doing now
[02:47:56.680 --> 02:48:00.360]  yeah it makes sense but they admitted they got the problem is they had their hands on their guns
[02:48:00.360 --> 02:48:04.200]  they probably would i mean god knows these people i mean they're just like we're a half mo
[02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:08.600]  boy uh i got get out of here first show me your id okay i don't have to but here it is
[02:48:08.600 --> 02:48:14.520]  all right get out of the area for the word of city park there's like guns we have guns war one
[02:48:14.520 --> 02:48:19.880]  memorial those but herman kane's like just call him up there your friend they admitted they got a
[02:48:19.880 --> 02:48:25.960]  call from the federal reserve there the security for the world war one memorial public park that's
[02:48:25.960 --> 02:48:31.960]  why they came over but yeah a little more on pilsbury their most important director who managed
[02:48:31.960 --> 02:48:36.680]  their business frederick t gates he went on from pilsbury to lead the rocker feller foundation
[02:48:36.680 --> 02:48:40.120]  to make them the monster they were with all the education i don't understand the rest of
[02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:45.560]  pilsbury's right at the top yeah and they're totally 100 in bed with the skull and bones
[02:48:45.560 --> 02:48:50.360]  there's all kinds of important politicians who branch out from their family line it's a total
[02:48:50.360 --> 02:48:56.840]  cartel alex and herman kane represents them that's how he rose to prominence well what about the
[02:48:56.840 --> 02:49:03.480]  fact that he wants us to have a sales tax he's like we've got to pay our debts i mean i gotta
[02:49:03.480 --> 02:49:09.480]  pull up those clips we don't owe this stuff herman kane he's a federal reserve pimp in there just like
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:17.160]  all of these mainline republicans he is in there wanting us to go okay more taxes so they
[02:49:17.160 --> 02:49:21.800]  can give it to themselves and bank or bailouts and he's like just call him up they'll tell you
[02:49:21.800 --> 02:49:26.360]  everything and you've heard him in the debates and in other statements he's pro torture they asked
[02:49:26.360 --> 02:49:31.320]  it would he end the wars would he bring the troops home well i can't answer that but i would listen
[02:49:31.320 --> 02:49:36.360]  to the advisors in other words the same council on foreign relations advisors that he already serves
[02:49:36.920 --> 02:49:42.200]  the same circle i mean he's he's he's horrible he's absolutely horrible another puppet waiting in
[02:49:42.200 --> 02:49:47.800]  the wings you know i take it back i say he's not as bad as a mint romney who supports carbon taxes
[02:49:47.800 --> 02:49:53.160]  and gun grabs and wrote the obama thing they're all the same it's an empty suit they'll rotate in
[02:49:53.160 --> 02:49:57.320]  whoever they could sell if they can't sell perry which they've already failed on they can't sell
[02:49:57.320 --> 02:50:03.800]  romney they have kane pale and others as well so but they there's one guy though they say we can't
[02:50:03.800 --> 02:50:09.160]  have he can't win no he can't win he's the guy that wants to get rid of the place herman kane was

[02:50:13.320 --> 02:50:18.360]  obviously probably the number one is ron paul's the only one that will actually point at the
[02:50:18.360 --> 02:50:23.480]  giant goblin in the room yeah and then i believe two debates back they asked the question about
[02:50:23.480 --> 02:50:27.400]  the federal reserve they asked everyone except ron paul what they would do to abolish the

[02:54:31.240 --> 02:54:39.240]  the story is out of no natural animal edification system.org and i went and checked it the original
[02:54:39.240 --> 02:54:47.400]  document can be seen i went and read it on the court document uh wisconsin judge a state judge
[02:54:47.400 --> 02:54:52.920]  has said that you're not allowed to have your own garden you're not allowed to have your own cow your
[02:54:52.920 --> 02:54:56.920]  own milk are not allowed to pay somebody to keep a cow for milk and that you do not have a fundamental
[02:54:56.920 --> 02:55:02.680]  right and that the state scope of police power is above you i'm going to be covering that tonight
[02:55:02.680 --> 02:55:07.080]  we got some something really special for you on info wars nightly news tonight seven o'clock there's
[02:55:07.080 --> 02:55:15.240]  also the info wars insider that is a free email that we send out videos articles multiple times
[02:55:15.240 --> 02:55:20.680]  weekly but always officially wednesday afternoon you want to sign up it's at the top of info wars
[02:55:20.680 --> 02:55:26.520]  dot com and prism planet dot com just put your email in there i will tell you that it causes us real
[02:55:26.520 --> 02:55:31.240]  havoc when people are lazy when they want to delete the email they just hit the spam button
[02:55:31.240 --> 02:55:37.240]  instead of delete that that that causes some problems but hey whatever say la vie uh point is
[02:55:37.240 --> 02:55:41.400]  is that we need to have direct contact with people and if you want that with us no matter what
[02:55:41.400 --> 02:55:47.400]  happens or comes up in the future sign up at prismplanet.tv to watch the show but more importantly
[02:55:47.400 --> 02:55:52.840]  sign up there at that email and info wars insider i'll do five minutes of overdrive here as i tend
[02:55:52.840 --> 02:55:56.840]  to always do now to finish up with calls because i at least want to get to um
[02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:04.920]  who's been holding the longest bill and uh gary and uh otter maybe joe we'll see but briefly
[02:56:05.720 --> 02:56:10.600]  joining us via skype uh from about 50 yards away we're testing skype out for when i go on the road
[02:56:10.600 --> 02:56:16.600]  is richard reeves and uh richard's a real ron paul expert but a ron paul delegate knocked on thousands
[02:56:16.600 --> 02:56:22.200]  of doors each sleeps and drinks it and he kind of disagrees he's saying ron paul will probably not run
[02:56:22.200 --> 02:56:28.600]  as a libertarian if he loses the primary and tell us why richard reeves well thanks alex i'm here
[02:56:28.600 --> 02:56:34.760]  broadcasting from the decentralized mobile command command center and no i don't think uh ron paul
[02:56:34.760 --> 02:56:39.800]  will bail out because there's a very important battle going on with the delegate battle
[02:56:39.800 --> 02:56:45.800]  that's going to be underlying and underneath the actual primary elections we're going to have to
[02:56:45.800 --> 02:56:49.800]  monitor and watch for the news stories that go unreported we're going to have to be digging to
[02:56:49.800 --> 02:56:55.240]  find out for example when we have the new hampshire primary okay yeah fine we're going to look at the
[02:56:56.040 --> 02:57:01.800]  official so-called black box voting results but more importantly exit for this battle we're going to
[02:57:01.800 --> 02:57:08.440]  have to we're going to have to find out what precisely happened in those all important precinct
[02:57:08.440 --> 02:57:12.760]  precinct conventions in new hampshire okay but look i don't want to put the car before the horse
[02:57:12.760 --> 02:57:16.280]  he can probably win especially if we believe in him he's in third place
[02:57:16.280 --> 02:57:20.920]  we're destroying the other candidates right now for the record i'm just saying if he loses in the
[02:57:20.920 --> 02:57:26.280]  primary i understand trying to build the party have libertarians and patriots take over the
[02:57:26.280 --> 02:57:30.760]  republican party i get that that's what campaign for liberty is doing i understand ron paul sees
[02:57:30.760 --> 02:57:37.240]  himself as part of a larger battle not you know not the whole war himself but it's all coming
[02:57:37.240 --> 02:57:43.160]  down right now and i think he could run as a libertarian and and state all this openly and
[02:57:43.160 --> 02:57:48.520]  tell people to go into the republican party or democratic party and stay in this key election
[02:57:48.520 --> 02:57:55.000]  and in those debates while everything's melting down i think it can be a bifurcated uh pincere attack
[02:57:55.000 --> 02:58:02.040]  here richard well i think that option in 2014 2016 is probably more viable option potentially
[02:58:02.040 --> 02:58:08.200]  upcoming elections but in this election it's just too important because if we go third party early
[02:58:08.200 --> 02:58:14.120]  then that means that patriots aren't voting in primaries for their county commissioners for their
[02:58:14.120 --> 02:58:20.840]  us house members for their us for their state legislative members these races in these primaries
[02:58:20.840 --> 02:58:26.120]  are so important in firing these long-term incumbents both on the republican side mainly on the
[02:58:26.120 --> 02:58:32.520]  republican side and also on democrat side ron paul knows that this whole race is way bigger than
[02:58:32.520 --> 02:58:36.600]  just all right all right stay there we're doing five more minutes at least let's finish up on
[02:58:36.600 --> 02:58:40.120]  that and then a few calls on the other side overdrive coming up see you back tomorrow live 11am

[03:00:04.520 --> 03:00:08.360]  okay we're doing a little bit of overdrive here with richard reeves i'm gonna try to jam in a few
[03:00:08.360 --> 03:00:13.720]  of your calls here in just a moment but richard when i ask you your opinion and i respect and
[03:00:13.720 --> 03:00:17.960]  look for that opinion on the ron paul stuff i understand you're obsessed with winning so you
[03:00:17.960 --> 03:00:22.360]  want to start telling us how we can get ron paul in and delegate stuff but the reason i got you
[03:00:22.360 --> 03:00:28.520]  on specifically was to comment on you know your view of this and and and i mean i tend to agree
[03:00:28.520 --> 03:00:33.320]  with you that's why ron paul may not do this uh is because he wants to continue through campaign
[03:00:33.320 --> 03:00:38.520]  for liberty passed him uh as he said he wants to change the course of this country not just be
[03:00:38.520 --> 03:00:45.240]  president uh that he's just basically trailblazing for us right now and that he's uh not going to want
[03:00:45.240 --> 03:00:50.760]  to just start some third party that fizzles out he's going to want to get everybody to basically
[03:00:50.760 --> 03:00:55.160]  take over the republican party and that is happening to a great extent to the old line
[03:00:55.160 --> 03:01:02.200]  republicans chagrin it sure is we saw that example in california uh united talked earlier
[03:01:02.760 --> 03:01:08.440]  how they actually canceled the texas republican straw poll they canceled the texas republican
[03:01:08.440 --> 03:01:13.800]  straw poll this year saying lack of interest come on now we've got rick perry and ron paul both
[03:01:13.800 --> 03:01:19.240]  texas candidates and there's supposedly a lack of interest that's the powers to be are very concerned
[03:01:19.240 --> 03:01:24.600]  and worried and one thing i looked at while you were discussing the situation with herman kane
[03:01:24.600 --> 03:01:31.640]  a federal reserve answer for president i looked at the schedule for the rnc the rnc schedule to occur
[03:01:31.640 --> 03:01:39.000]  in late august of 2012 if we win the delegate battle and are victorious there's no reason for
[03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:45.240]  ron paul to back out of any primaries he's got to go at least till that date if and when ron paul
[03:01:45.240 --> 03:01:50.840]  were to go third party i don't even know if it's possible at that late of a date but if he were
[03:01:50.840 --> 03:01:58.120]  to do it or try to do it it would be after the rnc which puts us around september of 2012
[03:01:58.120 --> 03:02:03.000]  and i'd have to do research to see if you can even get on the ballot at such a late time uh
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:07.560]  we're probably about september 2012 richard do research on that we'll talk more about it
[03:02:07.560 --> 03:02:12.360]  later in the week or next week thank you richard raves uh let's go ahead and go to bill and maryland
[03:02:12.360 --> 03:02:20.200]  bill you're on the air hey alex hey buddy if they if they run this guy against obama then it
[03:02:20.200 --> 03:02:25.080]  can be like they can run the whole election as a race card because they could say well if you don't
[03:02:25.080 --> 03:02:30.440]  like obama or you don't like herman kane and you don't like black people and you're not voting
[03:02:30.440 --> 03:02:36.600]  because you're black they can make every issue about it a black thing plus they could have one
[03:02:36.600 --> 03:02:41.000]  of their little political assassinations and fight riots and all their kinds of stuff like that
[03:02:41.640 --> 03:02:46.920]  no you're absolutely right i mean now if you don't like the weather they say it's racist if you have
[03:02:46.920 --> 03:02:50.760]  any opinion like i'm like mustard on that they're go because you're racist i mean there was a guy
[03:02:50.760 --> 03:02:55.800]  in an ice cream cone outfit with sprinkles on a Puerto Rican guy advertising an ice cream place
[03:02:55.800 --> 03:03:00.120]  and it caused a giant hissy fit i'm gonna cover that more tonight because they thought it was a
[03:03:00.120 --> 03:03:05.240]  clan person there's racial attacks all over the country but it's done mainly against whites because
[03:03:05.240 --> 03:03:10.760]  i guess it's seen that we're evil and deserve it uh and ap was labeled racist i'm gonna cover this
[03:03:10.760 --> 03:03:16.120]  tonight with examples because obama kind of talked and what i guess he thought was some
[03:03:16.120 --> 03:03:21.560]  weird urban dialect uh just like all the other politicians do whatever group they're talking to
[03:03:22.120 --> 03:03:28.200]  to to like make them like him and it's not racist to transcribe what obama actually said or did
[03:03:28.200 --> 03:03:34.680]  so yes i mean i this whole herman kane thing is a nightmare i mean why can't people support a black
[03:03:34.680 --> 03:03:40.120]  politician who's actually a patriot i know they're out there uh but i mean alan west was you know
[03:03:40.120 --> 03:03:45.000]  tries to sound like he's good but he went along with the bailout you know with the latest uh uh
[03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:51.240]  increase in uh the budget and he's a big warmonger but he's he's a really really smart guy knows
[03:03:51.240 --> 03:03:57.160]  exactly what he's doing very well spoken charismatic uh it's it's it's just terrible but at least
[03:03:57.160 --> 03:04:05.640]  herman kane doesn't play up race card stuff but but i do agree with you the media would still do that
[03:04:06.360 --> 03:04:12.520]  anything else on that um just like bill cosby he would be like a black person like people
[03:04:12.520 --> 03:04:16.840]  could vote for he would talk about issues i mean he probably wouldn't run for president but
[03:04:16.840 --> 03:04:23.240]  there's black people out there that address issues and but i mean like you said it would be a nightmare
[03:04:23.240 --> 03:04:27.720]  it's like it already plays into a false paradigm because as soon as you talk about it you're a
[03:04:27.720 --> 03:04:38.280]  racist well what if ron paul was black wow oh man oh gosh all right i appreciate your call look i'm
