[00:00.000 --> 00:12.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.400 --> 00:22.440]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones we
[00:22.440 --> 00:26.360]  have reached the halfway point in this Friday edition for the next 60 minutes
[00:26.360 --> 00:32.400]  James Traficant is our guest the iconic beam me up Scotty there's no intelligent
[00:32.400 --> 00:38.000]  life here congressman who was absolutely railroaded into prison there is no doubt
[00:38.000 --> 00:43.840]  about that for exposing corruption and tyranny in this nation and he's gonna
[00:43.840 --> 00:48.320]  discuss the tea parties he's running for the Congress again we're gonna get his
[00:48.320 --> 00:51.720]  take on the militarization of police what really happened in Oklahoma City he
[00:51.720 --> 00:55.960]  investigated that what happened with the Pan Am flight and a lot more and will
[00:55.960 --> 00:59.240]  take some phone calls because I did have the phones open earlier for military
[00:59.240 --> 01:02.920]  and police to call in we have all these government documents where they're
[01:02.920 --> 01:07.800]  training of the military for martial law in America and it's building towards
[01:07.800 --> 01:11.960]  our crescendo James Traficant good to have you on with us sir glad to be back
[01:11.960 --> 01:17.000]  Alex and I want to say after during when you show several months ago I didn't
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.600]  realize how strong a show you have now when I commend you as you were
[01:21.600 --> 01:27.480]  educating millions of American people I was surprised I'm honored to be asked to
[01:27.480 --> 01:30.440]  come back on the show well congressman we're honored to have you here because
[01:30.440 --> 01:34.280]  of your courage and your steadfastness so much is happening so much is going on
[01:34.280 --> 01:38.240]  I've got questions and issues I want to pick your brain about but out of the
[01:38.240 --> 01:43.080]  gates the state of the Union the state of the taxing system all the new VAT taxes
[01:43.080 --> 01:47.280]  they want telling us austerity taxes are gonna go up our benefits are gonna go
[01:47.280 --> 01:50.760]  down what does James Traficant say about that well number one I think the
[01:50.760 --> 01:54.600]  country is bankrupt that's evident and number two I think all they're talking
[01:54.600 --> 01:58.560]  about doing is this going to further implode this nation and I see us
[01:58.560 --> 02:02.440]  dismantling like the old Soviet Union I really do Alex I think that you can't
[02:02.440 --> 02:07.440]  continue to have the income tax to penalize this work subsidizes illigitimacy
[02:07.440 --> 02:12.140]  and rewards dependency it's time to throw it out abolish the IRS repeal the
[02:12.140 --> 02:18.040]  16th Amendment now you know I support a flat fare 25% consumption tax on final
[02:18.040 --> 02:21.880]  retail sales and my opponents are saying that's going to hurt the poor quite
[02:21.880 --> 02:25.640]  frankly Alex Harvard did a study and said when you throw out the burdensome
[02:25.640 --> 02:29.120]  compliance of the IRS is that the prices are going to drop the prices will
[02:29.120 --> 02:33.280]  probably be similar to what we have now but finally for those naysayers those
[02:33.280 --> 02:37.640]  people on the poverty level will simply take their pay stubs to the government
[02:37.640 --> 02:41.200]  and there will be a system as there exists now the only difference with the
[02:41.200 --> 02:45.840]  trafficking bill Alex is everybody must work who gets a government stipend I
[02:45.840 --> 02:49.520]  don't care if they have 12 children did work at the daycare center with those
[02:49.520 --> 02:54.360]  children but you see anybody that visits Broadway or or visits Las Vegas from
[02:54.360 --> 02:58.200]  Germany and Japan did pay into our tax scheme and finally it's a trade
[02:58.200 --> 03:02.320]  reciprocity program if a country has barriers against ours we have barriers
[03:02.320 --> 03:06.040]  against them we also quantify the standard of living in each country and
[03:06.040 --> 03:11.640]  weigh that down with tariffs as necessary but it's a flat 25% final
[03:11.640 --> 03:17.840]  retail sales tax no taxes on used materials but just news new retail
[03:17.840 --> 03:22.160]  sales and services and Alex if the country does not move to this scheme
[03:22.160 --> 03:26.440]  America will implode like the Soviet Union that's my prediction right here
[03:26.440 --> 03:29.760]  on the Alex Jones show well Congressman I've seen the similar studies I've
[03:29.760 --> 03:34.440]  talked to economists it would be good if we only had one federal tax other than
[03:34.440 --> 03:38.880]  the tariffs they could raise money with the problem is Obama and others they
[03:38.880 --> 03:44.080]  want a VAT on every level on top of the income tax yes this is the problem you
[03:44.080 --> 03:47.320]  got to throw the income tax out it was founded and it's the predicate of the
[03:47.320 --> 03:52.080]  communist platform of Karl Marx and it's done is that it's made a dependent
[03:52.080 --> 03:55.880]  society over here it's penalized work and that's the last thing that the
[03:55.880 --> 04:00.120]  founders wanted the reason we have the 16th amendment Alex is when we first
[04:00.120 --> 04:03.640]  started the income tax which by the way was only supposed to be on the rich
[04:03.640 --> 04:08.720]  people it was taken to the Supreme Court it was struck down as unconstitutional
[04:08.720 --> 04:13.040]  as a result we have this 16th amendment some people feel it wasn't
[04:13.040 --> 04:17.160]  adequately ratified to boot and then maybe we shouldn't repeal the 16th
[04:17.160 --> 04:21.600]  amendment we should just disregard it because it wasn't in fact awful but I
[04:21.600 --> 04:26.120]  think let's be safe let's repeal the 16th amendment abolish the IRS we don't
[04:26.120 --> 04:29.560]  need a Department of Energy we don't need a Department of Education there's
[04:29.560 --> 04:33.760]  too damn much government here Alex and what we don't need is we don't need more
[04:33.760 --> 04:38.560]  taxes on top of income taxes James Travis and stay there quick bright
[04:38.560 --> 04:41.800]  coming back with a long segment talk about a host of issues and the
[04:41.800 --> 04:46.120]  demonization of the tea parties all over the news saying they're racist they're

[08:00.640 --> 08:10.360]  ease the T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network James
[08:10.360 --> 08:15.600]  traffic ant former congressman is our guest I've researched his case and
[08:15.600 --> 08:19.520]  even been on national news they've admitted he was completely railroaded
[08:19.520 --> 08:25.080]  shut up be mainly because he was criticizing foreign aid period and
[08:25.080 --> 08:28.480]  foreign aid to Israel and they told them they were gonna get him and we had
[08:28.480 --> 08:32.720]  Jane Graham Oklahoma City bombing survivor she's on the ninth floor on
[08:32.720 --> 08:36.600]  last week she saw McVeigh and other feds planting gray sticks of butter didn't know
[08:36.600 --> 08:40.800]  what they were she brought this info to Congress they wouldn't talk to her the
[08:40.800 --> 08:44.200]  only person that would look at the information was James traffic ant and
[08:44.200 --> 08:47.440]  she said she talked to James traffic ants assistant in his office she said
[08:47.440 --> 08:52.960]  yeah they came and said give us those documents back and James traffic ant
[08:52.960 --> 08:56.120]  refused and they said we're gonna get James traffic ant but that was one of
[08:56.120 --> 09:00.640]  many reasons they went after but we'll talk about that today but continuing with
[09:00.640 --> 09:04.840]  your campaign you're running for Congress again you're you are gonna file
[09:04.840 --> 09:08.680]  tell us about that congressman I'll be filing this coming Monday as an
[09:08.680 --> 09:14.160]  independent in one of two districts I'm not sure because when I went to art
[09:14.160 --> 09:18.720]  school if you will Alex they split the district up into three ways to make sure
[09:18.720 --> 09:23.080]  I could never come back so I'm basically have no money but I think money plays
[09:23.080 --> 09:26.680]  too much a part in politics anyway I think it's time for somebody without a
[09:26.680 --> 09:30.160]  lot of money just to put the hay where the goats can reach it and tell the
[09:30.160 --> 09:35.720]  people what's going on and and run and run the old-fashioned way well you
[09:35.720 --> 09:38.660]  certainly got a lot of name recognition and a lot of people love you in your
[09:38.660 --> 09:42.720]  state there and know that I know that you were railroaded we talked about that
[09:42.720 --> 09:46.400]  some last time but perhaps because we have you know new audience tuning in all
[09:46.400 --> 09:49.960]  the time recap what happened to you and then we're gonna get into some of the
[09:49.960 --> 09:53.520]  current things that are happening and get your take on it like us army trains
[09:53.520 --> 09:58.200]  to confront tea party terrorist this is confirmed we have their internal training
[09:58.200 --> 10:02.240]  manuals where they prepare for gun confiscation war against the American
[10:02.240 --> 10:06.400]  people but first recapping your a railroading well you know number one
[10:06.400 --> 10:09.320]  several of the people that were involved already now admitted they were
[10:09.320 --> 10:13.840]  pressured to lie there's a young man in Nigeria young black man did found an
[10:13.840 --> 10:17.880]  affidavit with the with the Nigerian government Mr. O'Callow that his life
[10:17.880 --> 10:21.360]  was ruined because he wouldn't perjure himself against trafficking bottom line
[10:21.360 --> 10:26.680]  it was a six-year investigation 15 million dollars over 250 agents honor
[10:26.680 --> 10:30.360]  about the time Alex that the trade center and the Pentagon were being attacked
[10:30.360 --> 10:35.360]  and the government voluntarily stated at this trial that they made no tapes on
[10:35.360 --> 10:39.800]  me at all and now it's come out and I can't prove it yet but it's all over
[10:39.800 --> 10:42.800]  that they burn boxes and box the tapes because there was no physical evidence
[10:42.800 --> 10:47.480]  that seven people who said they bribed me three of them already recanted the two
[10:47.480 --> 10:51.320]  major charges were dropped because those people admitted before trial they were
[10:51.320 --> 10:55.320]  pressured to lie so now the prosecutors were confirmed insurance company
[10:55.320 --> 10:59.360]  somewhere in Ohio and they're scared to death and I want to say this on your
[10:59.360 --> 11:04.000]  show I want some whistleblower to come forward and confirm that they burn
[11:04.000 --> 11:08.320]  boxes and boxes of tapes they made on Jim Travkin over six-year investigation
[11:08.320 --> 11:11.920]  because the reason why they said they had no tapes Alex I could use their own
[11:11.920 --> 11:15.960]  tapes against them and say where's the crime so now I think they're showing it
[11:15.960 --> 11:19.320]  I think it's coming out I think most people realize what happened and
[11:19.320 --> 11:23.560]  remember I'm the guy that brought John Demony back home from Israel who was on
[11:23.560 --> 11:27.240]  death row for being I have a terrible in it maybe this is exclusive on your show
[11:27.240 --> 11:33.480]  today Alex that John Demony from Germany on trial now has requested of his his
[11:33.480 --> 11:39.000]  family and his defense that they bring me into Germany relative to this trial
[11:39.000 --> 11:43.480]  and if I am subpoenaed I am going to Germany so that's an exclusive for you
[11:43.480 --> 11:48.200]  Alex and to recap that the Israeli Supreme Court said you were right you
[11:48.200 --> 11:53.080]  got him the documents he was not the guy you we know who he was look nothing
[11:53.080 --> 11:58.000]  like this individual and then still the US government grabs him and sends him to
[11:58.000 --> 12:01.680]  Germany when Israel said he's innocent yes and you know what's amazing Alex
[12:01.680 --> 12:06.400]  must give Israel credit for this or Supreme Court took my evidence the US
[12:06.400 --> 12:09.240]  courts wouldn't accept it Congress wouldn't hold a hearing because they
[12:09.240 --> 12:13.920]  said it's too sensitive and Alex what I said is when the sensitivity quote unquote
[12:13.920 --> 12:17.880]  sensitivity waived the bill of rights my god what happened to us when you
[12:17.880 --> 12:21.760]  endanger the right of one American you endanger the rights of all Americans so
[12:21.760 --> 12:26.320]  what's happening now and I want this also as an update on your program Israel
[12:26.320 --> 12:32.040]  would not convene a trial on this new matter so they had to go to Germany our
[12:32.040 --> 12:36.880]  government is just trying to cover their tracks Alex they should be charged with
[12:36.880 --> 12:41.200]  attempted murder they knew this man wasn't Ivan and they suborned perjury
[12:41.200 --> 12:44.480]  they obstructed justice and they've got away with it they've gotten away with
[12:44.480 --> 12:48.600]  this Alex and they know he's ill it's official oppression I mean they've they
[12:48.600 --> 12:52.840]  they know he's innocent they're just doing this they're hoping he dies before
[12:52.840 --> 12:56.120]  there can even be a trial they're trying to cover up for what they did in the
[12:56.120 --> 12:59.960]  past just remember this Alex the documents that I got that took him off a
[12:59.960 --> 13:06.240]  death row after being convicted were Justice Department documents and the
[13:06.240 --> 13:10.040]  Justice Department knew that he was not the guy oh yeah absolutely this is out
[13:10.040 --> 13:16.440]  of hand we need a mechanism we need a mechanism Alex we need a mechanism where
[13:16.440 --> 13:21.160]  the I where the FBI and the Justice Department can be in fact tried one of
[13:21.160 --> 13:25.000]  my last bills was the Fair Justice Act the president would nominate the Senate
[13:25.000 --> 13:28.760]  would confirm for a ten-year term the director of the Fair Justice Agency
[13:28.760 --> 13:33.480]  would have only one duty Alex now be to investigate and prosecute crimes within
[13:33.480 --> 13:37.800]  the Justice Department my god we got a police state coming at us we've got a
[13:37.800 --> 13:42.280]  government that we were basically economic slaves here and no one's really
[13:42.280 --> 13:46.320]  looking at it seriously that's why I'm giving you credit you're going out on a
[13:46.320 --> 13:51.560]  limb and I remember telling Connie Chung about Pan Am 103 be very careful how you
[13:51.560 --> 13:57.400]  handle Pan Am 103 and she did us an hour special on the report confidential
[13:57.400 --> 14:00.920]  report I got and all I want to say is this couple weeks later she was never
[14:00.920 --> 14:06.680]  seen on TV again now you are a very courageous guy and I've been following
[14:06.680 --> 14:11.080]  you and I know that there are many people in the government they're very
[14:11.080 --> 14:15.280]  upset because you are educating the American people and American people have
[14:15.280 --> 14:19.560]  been dumbed down dumbed down through a mainstream media that has in fact aided
[14:19.560 --> 14:24.000]  this government I don't understand why Jim traffic in Sargasso
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.720]  congressman I don't want to talk about myself but I am in the middle of this and
[14:27.720 --> 14:32.760]  I want to ask your advice the ADL the Southern Property Law Center in the
[14:32.760 --> 14:38.160]  last six months or so have put out multiple reports of peace they're now
[14:38.160 --> 14:43.720]  even saying Ron Paul is a terrorist enabler they're saying judge de
[14:43.720 --> 14:47.920]  Palatano is an extremist terrorist enabler the mya co-man security reports
[14:47.920 --> 14:50.880]  that law enforcement sent us over a year ago say that gun owners conservatives
[14:50.880 --> 14:54.400]  returning veterans I'm sure you've seen that in the news now we've gotten army
[14:54.400 --> 14:57.880]  documents and we've confirmed that they're following us around and in the
[14:57.880 --> 15:04.240]  fed rallies we've confirmed that in these briefings for the military they
[15:04.240 --> 15:09.360]  project my photo up and like I'm the kingpin or the or the godfather and and
[15:09.360 --> 15:13.600]  say that I want cops to die and then I want the military just all lies and the
[15:13.600 --> 15:18.560]  national news nightline you name it have been down here CNN I mean the list
[15:18.560 --> 15:23.120]  goes on and on and they keep saying on the news and George Soros's outfit keeps
[15:23.120 --> 15:27.360]  saying I'm calling for violence when it's the opposite what does that sound
[15:27.360 --> 15:30.760]  like to you I mean are they really getting ready to set me up it sounds to
[15:30.760 --> 15:35.560]  me if you're a great American and you're making touch in contact with the
[15:35.560 --> 15:39.680]  average American and they don't like it let me just say this Alex there's no
[15:39.680 --> 15:43.200]  doubt that you're doing that now here's what you have to be concerned about that
[15:43.200 --> 15:47.400]  any technicality could be brought against you and my god they can be very
[15:47.400 --> 15:52.560]  vicious but let me say this I think this is a badge of honor my name was
[15:52.560 --> 15:56.360]  mentioned one time in an IRS review that said the American people shouldn't
[15:56.360 --> 16:00.440]  listen to Congressman Jim Travagan he's just anti-government and that was one of
[16:00.440 --> 16:04.720]  the biggest compliments I ever received and I think this is a compliment to you
[16:04.720 --> 16:08.640]  because I think it shows you as a leader now the downside is I don't like what
[16:08.640 --> 16:12.080]  they're doing to this tea party these are average American people they don't
[16:12.080 --> 16:15.640]  want to blow anything up and they're not going out there and acting violently
[16:15.640 --> 16:19.840]  and and Alex Jones is not recommending that anybody go out and cause any
[16:19.840 --> 16:24.000]  violence revolution this country and anybody with a bright mind and a
[16:24.000 --> 16:27.680]  reasonable mind understands that but what they're trying to do is stop this
[16:27.680 --> 16:31.160]  movement and the reason for it is very simple the American people are fed up
[16:31.160 --> 16:35.240]  and they should be they should be fed up and I think what you're doing is you're
[16:35.240 --> 16:39.400]  articulating the reasons why they're fed up the problem with the tea party to a
[16:39.400 --> 16:43.360]  degree is they're so upset but they don't really understand the total
[16:43.360 --> 16:47.960]  dimension of why they're upset and number one they're just opposing rather
[16:47.960 --> 16:51.480]  than advocating as well but I think I think they're starting to evolve now
[16:51.480 --> 16:55.800]  Alex with leadership that they're hearing from individuals like yourself and
[16:55.800 --> 16:59.920]  from commentary made by you and some others that they're starting to look at
[16:59.920 --> 17:03.600]  say look here's what we've got to do now here's what must be done in the country
[17:03.600 --> 17:09.080]  and I think what we have underway is a powerful political revolution taking
[17:09.080 --> 17:12.760]  place the United States of America and I believe the powers of beer trying to
[17:12.760 --> 17:16.280]  stop it they're trying to say that these people are radical their racist their
[17:16.280 --> 17:21.000]  biggest look I've been hit with the anti-Semite business the racist business
[17:21.000 --> 17:25.480]  the the bigot business but listen to what I stand for if you're an illegal
[17:25.480 --> 17:28.720]  immigrant in this country you're not just an immigrant you're an illegal
[17:28.720 --> 17:32.720]  immigrant you should be thrown the hell out enough is enough and we shouldn't be
[17:32.720 --> 17:37.040]  paying health care to take care of people that are driving our cost up so that
[17:37.040 --> 17:41.040]  makes me a bigot look that's just the way it is if you're an Hispanic American
[17:41.040 --> 17:44.240]  you're a friend of mine if you're an illegal immigrant I don't care what
[17:44.240 --> 17:48.080]  nationality you are you're not a friend of mine and you should be thrown out and
[17:48.080 --> 17:51.560]  we've got to do something about that take care of our borders I really feel
[17:51.560 --> 17:55.480]  sorry what's going on in Arizona and the way they're depicting Arizona you know I
[17:55.480 --> 18:00.040]  am the congressman Alex the past putting 10,000 soldiers on our border and
[18:00.040 --> 18:05.080]  keeping people out and keeping drugs out and listen these these uh soldiers are
[18:05.080 --> 18:09.320]  overseas in Germany and in Japan and in Korea they're going to the theater and
[18:09.320 --> 18:13.280]  going to lunch they're going to borders in the mid east and got our borders are
[18:13.280 --> 18:18.400]  wide open what kind of national security and homeland security does America have
[18:18.400 --> 18:24.920]  this is a joke both of these parties are care are basically trying to seduce
[18:24.920 --> 18:29.680]  this growing minority population of Hispanics into a voting block and it's
[18:29.680 --> 18:34.360]  larger now than the African-American community enough is enough let's take
[18:34.360 --> 18:38.440]  care of our government call us what you want but I just pray to God that you
[18:38.440 --> 18:43.440]  just continue to do what you're doing the reason they're focusing on you is
[18:43.440 --> 18:47.440]  you're effective and that's the reason they focused on you and that's what's
[18:47.440 --> 18:50.640]  scary I don't want to go to prison with them setting me up or something don't
[18:50.640 --> 18:55.160]  think don't think that that is on and that that's for alone here's the thing
[18:55.160 --> 18:58.760]  I could be concerned about you know I don't know what your relationship is
[18:58.760 --> 19:02.360]  with your network but they'll be people behind the scenes trying to take that
[19:02.360 --> 19:06.360]  microphone away from you because you're having an impact I know let me tell you
[19:06.360 --> 19:11.520]  how I know about it I can't explain to you how many times people said to me I
[19:11.520 --> 19:16.520]  heard your comments on the Alex Jones show I'm very proud of you I agree with
[19:16.520 --> 19:21.040]  you thank you for doing the Alex Jones show we think Alex does a great job
[19:21.040 --> 19:24.960]  we were surprised you're on there some people may be afraid to be on there and
[19:24.960 --> 19:29.120]  they say we don't know why we're glad you were on there Jim and people with the
[19:29.120 --> 19:33.400]  bottom line is I've heard this all over people commenting about this everywhere
[19:33.400 --> 19:38.240]  I go Alex so you're reaching people and I think you're you're reaching people
[19:38.240 --> 19:42.560]  with an intelligent approach and there's certainly no doubt in my mind you're not
[19:42.560 --> 19:47.160]  advocating any type of violence or anything none of us are congressman

[24:14.360 --> 24:18.560]  their phony drug war it's totally criminal there's murders ranchers being
[24:18.560 --> 24:23.160]  killed Texas Arizona I mean it's a mess and then meanwhile Washington Post
[24:23.160 --> 24:27.240]  human rights observers killed an attack in Mexico they talked about all over
[24:27.240 --> 24:30.720]  Mexico they're shutting the power and water off to Indian groups that live
[24:30.720 --> 24:35.040]  down there Mexico's very racist towards the Indian population I don't know why
[24:35.040 --> 24:39.600]  I mean that it's I mean the folks in Mexico are Indian and Spanish mainly and
[24:39.600 --> 24:43.840]  some Germans that immigrated there during the colonial system and then
[24:43.840 --> 24:48.000]  here's another one Mexico acknowledges migrant abuse pledges changes I mean they
[24:48.000 --> 24:52.920]  don't give free welfare to any people they arrest illegals instantly I as an
[24:52.920 --> 24:55.960]  American can't go down there with my wife and have a baby and have it all
[24:55.960 --> 25:00.520]  paid for I mean this is a sick joke congressman absolutely Alex you're
[25:00.520 --> 25:04.440]  right on target I think we even have to change the Constitution if someone comes
[25:04.440 --> 25:08.760]  across our border illegally for the purpose of having a child and having an
[25:08.760 --> 25:12.600]  American citizen I think that should be changed and the citizenship should be
[25:12.600 --> 25:16.360]  denied and the woman should be removed the country enough is enough no one
[25:16.360 --> 25:20.840]  realizes you know we had a case up here northeast Ohio just real quick like where
[25:20.840 --> 25:25.640]  a fellow went in with a card and got a surgery on his pancreas and ten days
[25:25.640 --> 25:29.360]  later another fellow come in with the same card to get surgery and they did
[25:29.360 --> 25:32.720]  the surgery they didn't realize it till they checked the paperwork and they were
[25:32.720 --> 25:36.400]  both illegal can't find them and did two particular surgeries that the
[25:36.400 --> 25:40.760]  American people our people up here ended up paying for I mean this is in our own
[25:40.760 --> 25:45.920]  backyard now imagine what this like in voting booths with fake ID fake
[25:45.920 --> 25:51.240]  driver's license fake social security card it's gone too far and now we're
[25:51.240 --> 25:56.800]  talking about we're talking about making citizens and the state out of
[25:56.800 --> 26:01.520]  illegals who jumped the fence by God Alex this is putting a neon sign right on
[26:01.520 --> 26:04.520]  the border saying hey jump the fence and eventually you become an American
[26:04.520 --> 26:09.240]  citizen far well the feds are financing illegal checkpoints to the states
[26:09.240 --> 26:13.720]  everywhere all this Arizona law says is that if they have suspicion and then
[26:13.720 --> 26:16.760]  you're an illegal when they pull you over for drunk driving or whatever it is
[26:16.760 --> 26:20.240]  that the state's going to take you to the feds I mean all that's doing is
[26:20.240 --> 26:24.200]  enforcing the law since winter states not supposed to you know if they catch
[26:24.200 --> 26:26.440]  somebody committing a federal crime to not arrest him
[26:26.440 --> 26:30.240]  amen it's the United States of America not the federal government of America
[26:30.240 --> 26:35.160]  let me say this on your show I support the Arizona law because the reason for
[26:35.160 --> 26:39.760]  the Arizona machination is simple the federal government has failed to act on
[26:39.760 --> 26:43.800]  behalf of the American people the federal government's job is for national
[26:43.800 --> 26:47.920]  security and how the hell can you have national security with a border that's
[26:47.920 --> 26:53.160]  not secure someone tell me that so I support I support what they're doing in
[26:53.160 --> 26:57.120]  Arizona and they've got to stand up bring this is a microcosm of the failed
[26:57.120 --> 27:01.240]  policies of America bring the American people attention to it now the mainstream
[27:01.240 --> 27:05.560]  media is making Arizona look like racist look like bigots and they're going to
[27:05.560 --> 27:09.720]  lose conventions and they're going to lose money look the bottom line is the
[27:09.720 --> 27:13.400]  federal government has caused this problem for Arizona and for all these
[27:13.400 --> 27:16.720]  border states the federal government should be taking the brunt of the attack
[27:16.720 --> 27:20.080]  and that's what I don't like I like Jones and that's what I don't like Jim
[27:20.080 --> 27:23.920]  Travegan because the truth of the matter is very plain for us to see the
[27:23.920 --> 27:27.680]  federal government is failed to secure our borders how can you have a homeland
[27:27.680 --> 27:32.200]  security border program with a border wide open alley well what do you think
[27:32.200 --> 27:36.520]  about Obama announcing yesterday he's sending SWAT teams to quote all the oil
[27:36.520 --> 27:42.440]  rigs and some Reagan administration officials are on record saying they
[27:42.440 --> 27:47.800]  believe this is greasing the skids for the feds nationalizing oil I wouldn't be
[27:47.800 --> 27:51.280]  surprised the way the country is going we've nationalized everything just keep
[27:51.280 --> 27:57.480]  this in mind general motors government motors stock is now trading at 27 cents
[27:57.480 --> 28:02.920]  the share let's be honest about this we have buoyed up a false economic illusion
[28:02.920 --> 28:07.480]  here all these new hires they're talking about Alex were census workers now you
[28:07.480 --> 28:13.280]  got a health bill with listeners 159 new boards programs and entities to be
[28:13.280 --> 28:20.720]  created more IRS enforcement plus an additional 16,500 IRS employees to be
[28:20.720 --> 28:26.360]  hired at a cost of $1.7 trillion all of these jobs we have more government
[28:26.360 --> 28:30.600]  workers and factory workers are ready and this is a false illusion I think the
[28:30.600 --> 28:34.480]  best thing that could be done is the states have got to put their foot down
[28:34.480 --> 28:38.520]  here and that we have no more states right their background music in a
[28:38.520 --> 28:43.600]  doctor's office and maybe Arizona will highlight the issue of the United States
[28:43.600 --> 28:49.080]  of America remember there used to be a nation known as USSR and now they broke
[28:49.080 --> 28:53.320]  up don't think we can't implode and I predict that I predict unless there's a
[28:53.320 --> 28:58.000]  direct intended change in taxes it starts a reward work that we're gonna
[28:58.000 --> 29:02.440]  implode it's just a matter of time well you got the federal government calling
[29:02.440 --> 29:06.280]  for carbon taxes but then China and India and Mexico and others don't have to
[29:06.280 --> 29:10.080]  have the carbon taxes I mean that will kill the economy why does the federal
[29:10.080 --> 29:13.240]  government want to kill the economy you know what Alex what's really funny is
[29:13.240 --> 29:17.960]  the reports and I'll say the French reports say that most of the carbon
[29:17.960 --> 29:22.320]  problems in America are brought in from the trade winds from the parties from
[29:22.320 --> 29:26.640]  China and Japan and these countries don't want to do anything about their
[29:26.640 --> 29:31.360]  carbon emission emission I think look I think it's time for us to say we can
[29:31.360 --> 29:35.520]  handle our economic problems and the world can handle theirs too but good
[29:35.520 --> 29:41.120]  fences make good board make good friends stay there Jim traffic ant former
[29:41.120 --> 29:44.600]  Congress from Ohio is our guest we'll talk about Oklahoma City straight ahead
[29:44.600 --> 29:48.800]  and a lot more in his campaign how you can get involved in it getting back in

[32:56.720 --> 33:11.080]  we are back live with Jim Traficant what an interesting person he's not only a
[33:11.080 --> 33:18.080]  former congressman he was drafted into the NFL of the Pittsburgh Steelers in
[33:18.080 --> 33:22.520]  1963 he also obtained a master's degree from the University of Pittsburgh
[33:22.520 --> 33:26.640]  another from York Youngstown State University we're going to be going back
[33:26.640 --> 33:29.840]  to him here in just a moment talk about Oklahoma City and some other subjects
[33:29.840 --> 33:35.960]  and also take some phone calls for the congressman and they can also talk about
[33:35.960 --> 33:41.840]  the the experiences they've had with law enforcement the military being
[33:41.840 --> 33:46.360]  militarized to go up against the American people but Jim Traficant is our
[33:46.360 --> 33:51.560]  guest we've had two new films come out in the month of April and one is Invisible
[33:51.560 --> 33:57.120]  Empire a new order to find two hours plus jam-packed 18 months in the making
[33:57.120 --> 34:01.880]  government narcotics trafficking white slavery running staging terror attacks
[34:01.880 --> 34:06.720]  police state how the globalist operate it I mean it's an encyclopedia the new
[34:06.720 --> 34:11.880]  film available on DVD at info wars.com your purchase of the DVD also supports
[34:11.880 --> 34:15.160]  our broadcast you can make copies of it give it to everyone you know the people
[34:15.160 --> 34:19.040]  are ready to be awakened and I don't really get the credit for the effect
[34:19.040 --> 34:23.000]  this shows having it's really you the listeners that are taking action so I
[34:23.000 --> 34:25.560]  want to thank all of you that have taken action and of course we released this
[34:25.560 --> 34:31.480]  film last week police state for the rise of FEMA a year in the making covers the
[34:31.480 --> 34:35.880]  police state the military being trained to take on the American people and so
[34:35.880 --> 34:40.920]  much more it proves that the underwear bombing was a staged event with eyewitnesses
[34:40.920 --> 34:43.640]  that we interviewed that were on the plane and that saw the feds getting him
[34:43.640 --> 34:47.960]  on the plane and that's now been admitted by the way police state for the
[34:47.960 --> 34:51.000]  rise of FEMA you can get both the films together and get them discounted or you
[34:51.000 --> 35:00.960]  can also call toll free to order 888-253-3139-888-2533139 and you can
[35:00.960 --> 35:04.680]  also watch the films in super high quality and this live broadcast that we
[35:04.680 --> 35:09.000]  simulcast for the radio at prisonplanet.tv going back to Jim Travacant
[35:09.000 --> 35:14.320]  Jim Oklahoma City I mean take us back to 1995 and again I the reason I bring this
[35:14.320 --> 35:18.760]  up is I mean you've been involved in everything I investigate if it's
[35:18.760 --> 35:22.880]  exposing tyranny you you find Jim Travacant there I didn't even know that
[35:22.880 --> 35:26.800]  no member of Congress would talk to her and other survivors of that horrible
[35:26.800 --> 35:31.440]  bombing that she saw the feds in there which you later learn planting bombs with
[35:31.440 --> 35:35.200]  telephone wire and gray sticks of butter in the weeks before including Tim
[35:35.200 --> 35:41.440]  McVeigh and others and that when she and others brought you this information that
[35:41.440 --> 35:45.040]  you were the only person that would look at it and that she said that your
[35:45.040 --> 35:49.320]  staff said that you were threatened to to shut up about it but that you wouldn't
[35:49.320 --> 35:53.840]  shut up so give us your take on what happened there but one I don't think
[35:53.840 --> 36:00.080]  there's any way that truck load of fertilizer that exploded outside could
[36:00.080 --> 36:06.120]  have had the type of impact internally that showed from that and immediately I
[36:06.120 --> 36:10.360]  had my doubts what's amazing about it is the reason I was the only one is
[36:10.360 --> 36:14.280]  Congress is afraid most members of Congress don't want to get involved in
[36:14.280 --> 36:18.040]  anything there first of all they may look like a cuckoo if you do second of
[36:18.040 --> 36:20.720]  all they made it look like you're an American if you do because they're gonna
[36:20.720 --> 36:24.520]  have the mainstream press against you but since the Dominion case everybody
[36:24.520 --> 36:28.640]  would rely on me and I got most of the information what I found out and what I
[36:28.640 --> 36:32.840]  felt would happen Oklahoma City that there was much broader conspiracy and
[36:32.840 --> 36:37.520]  activity involved there and I wouldn't be surprised for some reason that there
[36:37.520 --> 36:40.720]  were complications that involve government and government officials as
[36:40.720 --> 36:46.360]  well that's what a my deduction was but I couldn't get to first base with
[36:46.360 --> 36:49.080]  anything Alex and you have to understand you have to have something
[36:49.080 --> 36:53.040]  concrete which I was able to develop in the Dominion case they couldn't get
[36:53.040 --> 36:56.320]  around the evidence but I had to send it to an Israeli Supreme Court to get
[36:56.320 --> 37:00.080]  anything done with it so you could imagine the problem I was getting trying
[37:00.080 --> 37:05.760]  to get in garter and glean more information relative to the Oklahoma
[37:05.760 --> 37:10.880]  City bombing but what I can't say is this there's a lot more to it and I
[37:10.880 --> 37:14.240]  don't believe anything anymore the government is telling the American
[37:14.240 --> 37:17.840]  people I don't want to get involved in the 9-1-1 issue but I have my doubts
[37:17.840 --> 37:22.800]  about 9-1-1 as well now remember I got the Dominion information I got the
[37:22.800 --> 37:28.520]  actual factual information on Pan Am 103 and I know exactly what happened to
[37:28.520 --> 37:32.760]  Pan Am 103 and it's not what our government said happened tell us what
[37:32.760 --> 37:36.680]  happened with Pan Am 103 the report I got was an intelligence report that said
[37:36.680 --> 37:42.200]  a man named Ahmed Jibril and Monzer Al-Qasar were hired by Iran to respond
[37:42.200 --> 37:46.960]  to America shooting down of that Iranian Airbus if you recall that yes and they
[37:46.960 --> 37:51.720]  put together an international team and they couldn't find a target and Monzer
[37:51.720 --> 37:57.000]  Al-Qasar who shipped heroin from the from the Golden Triangle to New York
[37:57.000 --> 38:04.440]  through Frankfort started to see Ahmed Jibril's people around Frankfort
[38:04.440 --> 38:09.080]  Airport and supposedly he was worried it was gonna ruin his gravy train and there
[38:09.080 --> 38:12.840]  was an anonymous call made warning there's going to be and a terrorist act
[38:12.840 --> 38:17.280]  around the airport but there was no increase in security to more or less
[38:17.280 --> 38:22.040]  chase Ahmed Jibril away the bottom line is the plane went down over Lockerbie
[38:22.040 --> 38:26.000]  it was supposed to go down over the ocean but Windriff took it over Rockerbie
[38:26.000 --> 38:29.840]  here's things I could tell you number one there there was an anonymous call
[38:29.840 --> 38:34.320]  made at Frankfort International with no increase in security and second of all
[38:34.320 --> 38:38.960]  two weeks after the incident first President Bush asked for Ahmed Jibril
[38:38.960 --> 38:45.440]  to be extradited the United States and Syria United Monzer Al-Qasar was the
[38:45.440 --> 38:53.400]  biggest heroin man and he made his living shipping to America now what the
[38:53.400 --> 38:57.040]  report said was that he was influential Alex and getting French hostages
[38:57.040 --> 39:01.880]  released from Iran and he was working with the CIA 11 on office to get
[39:01.880 --> 39:06.320]  American hostages at the time I believe there were eight there Alex it said that
[39:06.320 --> 39:10.440]  there was nothing good happening so the CIA sent a team to see what was going on
[39:10.440 --> 39:16.440]  headed by an Army Major McKee from Pittsburgh on leave to the CIA Alex all
[39:16.440 --> 39:26.120]  of those five CIA agents and Major McKee were killed on that 103 flight but what
[39:26.120 --> 39:31.560]  it was is our government the report says covered up the truthful incident
[39:31.560 --> 39:35.800]  because of the American people knew that heroin was being overlooked because
[39:35.800 --> 39:40.440]  this valuable asset Monzer Al-Qasar did be a revolution over here so the first
[39:40.440 --> 39:43.960]  thing the government said is trafficking is anti-government CIA said it's
[39:43.960 --> 39:48.360]  nonsense and naturally no one went with it but Connie Chung went with it and the
[39:48.360 --> 39:52.200]  truth of the matter was they end up arresting these two Libyans one of them
[39:52.200 --> 39:55.800]  was even released and believe me if they were guilty they'd have choked on a
[39:55.800 --> 39:59.400]  chicken bone over there in Gaddafi's prison this is the truth of what happened
[39:59.400 --> 40:04.080]  in 103 so I didn't have the time to look into 911 but I'll tell you this I was
[40:04.080 --> 40:09.480]  starting to get reports Alex people were starting to confide in me and what I
[40:09.480 --> 40:13.680]  don't like is I don't believe the Commission I didn't believe the Warren
[40:13.680 --> 40:18.640]  Commission I didn't believe the Commission on 911 I believe these
[40:18.640 --> 40:23.280]  commissions are nothing more than to ensure that there's no reprisals and
[40:23.280 --> 40:26.360]  repercussions from the American people and I think that's why they're
[40:26.360 --> 40:30.640]  concerned about you I think you're exposing these things I think America's
[40:30.640 --> 40:34.840]  better off if we know the truth we know the truth about our government and this
[40:34.840 --> 40:37.840]  is where I think the problem is the American people don't trust the
[40:37.840 --> 40:42.920]  government anymore and I see a tremendous upheaval I see an American
[40:42.920 --> 40:49.200]  political revolution on maybe 2010 may not be the actual fulcrum for that
[40:49.200 --> 40:54.440]  occurring but it's not far off Alex you're going to see a tremendous upheaval
[40:54.440 --> 40:57.440]  in this country where the American people are going to respond to this
[40:57.440 --> 41:01.760]  illegal immigration issue this so-called cap and trade type issue this big
[41:01.760 --> 41:07.320]  government health care issue with 159 new boards and and going to in fact
[41:07.320 --> 41:12.160]  be insured almost 50 million illegal immigrants there's a hell of a lot more
[41:12.160 --> 41:16.360]  than 12 to 15 illegals in this country Alex when the truth comes out I think
[41:16.360 --> 41:20.160]  you're going to the American people are going to revolt but I think it's going
[41:20.160 --> 41:23.880]  to be a peaceful revolution and let me say this I know that you've never
[41:23.880 --> 41:28.560]  advocated violence but you are advocating that the American people take a stand
[41:28.560 --> 41:32.840]  that what bothers me is they're trying to paint this key party is something
[41:32.840 --> 41:37.600]  sinister and it's not you know what bothers me more than that is all these
[41:37.600 --> 41:41.120]  politicians keep saying we need you to vote we need you to get involved in
[41:41.120 --> 41:44.640]  government well here's a group that's getting involved they're getting very
[41:44.640 --> 41:48.200]  involved and everybody's saying whoa we don't want you to be involved well it's
[41:48.200 --> 41:52.400]  what they're calling for I mean they're calling for lower taxes abolish the
[41:52.400 --> 41:56.240]  fellow reserve have national sovereignty defend our borders defend the
[41:56.240 --> 42:00.920]  Second Amendment do what this country was built on to be Americans and that was
[42:00.920 --> 42:04.960]  the question I was about to bring back up Bill Clinton and others go on TV and
[42:04.960 --> 42:09.920]  say gee I hope there isn't another Oklahoma City caused by the Tea Parties
[42:09.920 --> 42:14.480]  but I'm afraid it's going to happen the only card that criminal elements of the
[42:14.480 --> 42:19.280]  government can play is to stage a terror attack another Oklahoma City in this
[42:19.280 --> 42:23.720]  country to go after the American people and I see them framing myself by name
[42:23.720 --> 42:29.120]  but the entire Tea Party and libertarians and Ron Paul as causing
[42:29.120 --> 42:32.560]  whatever is about to happen I mean that looks like two plus two equals four to
[42:32.560 --> 42:37.160]  me I mean the only card they can play is a stage terror attack Alex is very
[42:37.160 --> 42:41.000]  unfortunate and I've said this without disrespect but I'm gonna say it right
[42:41.000 --> 42:45.120]  here on your show they don't call Clinton flick Willy for nothing the
[42:45.120 --> 42:48.120]  Democrats have worried they're worried that American people are going to take
[42:48.120 --> 42:52.120]  their venom out on the party in power as they did years ago when they threw
[42:52.120 --> 42:56.120]  Hasterton the Republicans out truth of the matter is both of these parties have
[42:56.120 --> 43:00.120]  been compromised I talked about it on the Greta Brown-Stustin show I talked
[43:00.120 --> 43:04.120]  about on your show I've been labeled anti-Semite we have basically a
[43:04.120 --> 43:08.120]  foreign nation Israel who's controlling the American Congress they've got us in
[43:08.120 --> 43:13.120]  two wars and it bankrupted us and now we're in a situation where the American
[43:13.120 --> 43:17.120]  people are saying why are our kids coming back in body bags what are we doing
[43:17.120 --> 43:21.120]  over there why are we continuing to go bankrupt with these wars now they're
[43:21.120 --> 43:25.120]  starting to sense that the American people don't even control their Congress
[43:25.120 --> 43:30.120]  which they don't this is the tragedy here but they have former president
[43:30.120 --> 43:34.120]  Clinton who is still very popular come out and say my god if something something
[43:34.120 --> 43:38.120]  bad is going to happen because this tea party this tea party can produce some bad
[43:38.120 --> 43:43.120]  things look if there's anything bad that happened is because the American people
[43:43.120 --> 43:48.120]  are totally disgusted a man who flew his plane into an IRS building in Texas a man
[43:48.120 --> 43:53.120]  who bulldozed his home in Ohio because he was tired of the bank this is what's
[43:53.120 --> 43:57.120]  happening you're seeing the American people react because their government is
[43:57.120 --> 44:02.120]  failing to address the problems that exist in the country period I agree with
[44:02.120 --> 44:06.120]  you and there's lots of things happening that are real but if you look at the
[44:06.120 --> 44:10.120]  preconditioning in the build-up and even the Atari militia we've documented
[44:10.120 --> 44:14.120]  that was a total federal setup with people inside provocaturing them to shoot
[44:14.120 --> 44:19.120]  their mouths off and so they had they're having these busts to create this background
[44:19.120 --> 44:24.120]  story that oh look the gun owners are about to attack to attack and we know
[44:24.120 --> 44:29.120]  we have the documents that they're training the military for gun confiscation
[44:29.120 --> 44:35.120]  we've had the mayor of Schenectady New York we've had house reps in the
[44:35.120 --> 44:39.120]  legislature of Illinois and others calling for troops on the streets I mean
[44:39.120 --> 44:43.120]  this is getting really creepy well let me tell you the politician should be calling
[44:43.120 --> 44:47.120]  for troops troops on the border to stay off of the American people and that
[44:47.120 --> 44:51.120]  Second Amendment wasn't protect duck hunters it was to protect the American
[44:51.120 --> 44:54.120]  people from a government and let me tell you something they're bringing this on
[44:54.120 --> 44:59.120]  themselves but the good thing is happening is all these issues are now coming
[44:59.120 --> 45:04.120]  to light Ellie they're coming to light because you and I as a leader you as a
[45:04.120 --> 45:08.120]  leader and there are others out there but they're not as strong this is what
[45:08.120 --> 45:12.120]  I'm saying to you now you have to be very careful they will make some
[45:12.120 --> 45:17.120]  technicality into a major cardinal crime and that's the way it works so I think
[45:17.120 --> 45:22.120]  you having heard these comments I think you know that you're very no I know and
[45:22.120 --> 45:25.120]  I'm very aware of it I appreciate you talking about it I I mean I never
[45:25.120 --> 45:28.120]  intended to have this big of an effect I mean I wanted to have an effect but I
[45:28.120 --> 45:31.120]  didn't know I'd get in the position of within so many of these documents
[45:31.120 --> 45:34.120]  they're saying there's the enemy getting getting but but I've talked to so many
[45:34.120 --> 45:38.120]  troops that have called me and sent us information they say that's why the
[45:38.120 --> 45:42.120]  troops and police then tune into the show because they're told don't listen to
[45:42.120 --> 45:47.120]  Alex Jones he's bad I mean the government is smart at certain levels but
[45:47.120 --> 45:51.120]  it's also stupid Alex you know the amazing thing when I brought John
[45:51.120 --> 45:56.120]  Deminick home I got a number of calls sorted just like this just was the
[45:56.120 --> 46:01.120]  good job Congressman we're proud of you hang up good job Congressman hang up
[46:01.120 --> 46:05.120]  the reason those calls are so quick as they were coming from the Justice
[46:05.120 --> 46:09.120]  Court believe me the people in the government knew what they did to
[46:09.120 --> 46:12.120]  Deminick people think there's a lot of people in the government don't like
[46:12.120 --> 46:15.120]  what's going on Alex there's a lot of people in the government that are
[46:15.120 --> 46:19.120]  listening to you now the problem is we're starting to get all this militia talk
[46:19.120 --> 46:23.120]  we need militia because we've got all these groups are establishing look all
[46:23.120 --> 46:28.120]  of the government's troops should be concentrating on securing our borders
[46:28.120 --> 46:33.120]  getting us out of these wars overseas that have bankrupt us and take care of
[46:33.120 --> 46:37.120]  America's issues they shouldn't be targeting American people that's what
[46:37.120 --> 46:40.120]  they're doing and what I don't like about it is if you look at the Tea Party
[46:40.120 --> 46:44.120]  the Tea Party you're basically frustrated Americans but they're Republicans
[46:44.120 --> 46:48.120]  and they're Democrats they voted for Republican presidents and they voted
[46:48.120 --> 46:52.120]  for Democrat presidents and what they're saying loud and clear and everybody's
[46:52.120 --> 46:56.120]  trying to dilute it because they're afraid that the party in power is going
[46:56.120 --> 47:00.120]  to be removed and that's where President Clinton come in I think it's very
[47:00.120 --> 47:04.120]  unfortunate that he made that statement but I'm going to make this statement
[47:04.120 --> 47:09.120]  on the Alex Jones show they don't call him slick Willy for nothing
[47:09.120 --> 47:14.120]  and I made that statement on a Robert Novak show when the IRS threatened
[47:14.120 --> 47:18.120]  a veto of the IRS reform bill because of the trafficking language that changed
[47:18.120 --> 47:22.120]  the burden of proof and I said on the Robert Novak show that President Clinton
[47:22.120 --> 47:26.120]  isn't called slick Willy for nothing he could sign the bill and help the
[47:26.120 --> 47:31.120]  second taxpayers or he could veto the bill and help a few IRS agents and he
[47:31.120 --> 47:34.120]  signed the bill and that's the type of pressure we need to put back
[47:34.120 --> 47:38.120]  President Clinton should not have made that statement he should reverse that
[47:38.120 --> 47:44.120]  statement let me sorry go ahead and this is what I'm saying disregard that
[47:44.120 --> 47:48.120]  statement that's a political statement that's not a national security statement
[47:48.120 --> 47:52.120]  and it's unfortunate let me bring up another issue I'm gonna take a few calls
[47:52.120 --> 47:55.120]  for you and also give out your address for people that want to support your campaign
[47:55.120 --> 47:59.120]  or physically get involved you're filing money we want to have you back as that
[47:59.120 --> 48:03.120]  unfolds you're very gracious with your time sir again Jim Travick and joining
[48:03.120 --> 48:08.120]  us it has come out that a lot of Republicans and Democrats are gay
[48:08.120 --> 48:12.120]  and I'm not attacking him for that but but that they're being blackmailed like
[48:12.120 --> 48:15.120]  if they're a drug dealer or they're taking bribes or there's a lot of different
[48:15.120 --> 48:19.120]  ways you can get compromised and the word from really good sources is Obama's
[48:19.120 --> 48:24.120]  being compromised and blackmailed that Congressman Lindsey Graham was the head
[48:24.120 --> 48:28.120]  of alley pack which is of you know a very serious focused guy I've been watching
[48:28.120 --> 48:33.120]  for over a decade I've never heard Mr. Gean say something that wasn't true he says
[48:33.120 --> 48:37.120]  he's got it down pat that Lindsey Graham is just running around basically all over
[48:37.120 --> 48:41.120]  the place you know in the streets cruising and that they're blackmailing him
[48:41.120 --> 48:45.120]  five days after that information was released Graham said I'm not doing
[48:45.120 --> 48:51.120]  immigration reform I'm not going for the carbon tax he he said I'm done
[48:51.120 --> 48:57.120]  and how big a problem is blackmail in Congress for congressmen women who
[48:57.120 --> 49:01.120]  really are involved in hanky-panky it's very big Alex now look I can't speak on
[49:01.120 --> 49:07.120]  any individual case but again as I got personal information remember I'm the
[49:07.120 --> 49:12.120]  fellow on the house floor it said that Janet Reno was a lesbian and she was
[49:12.120 --> 49:18.120]  controlled by organized crime who had photographs of her with young women now
[49:18.120 --> 49:23.120]  I was protected by the speech and debate clause but I went on again a national
[49:23.120 --> 49:28.120]  TV show the Robert Novak show and I re-edit those statements and I said go
[49:28.120 --> 49:32.120]  ahead Janet I'm not protected by the speech and debate clause take me to
[49:32.120 --> 49:36.120]  court because maybe now we'll find out why you will not allow an investigation
[49:36.120 --> 49:42.120]  in ten million dollars from a red Chinese Army general that went to President
[49:42.120 --> 49:47.120]  Clinton's campaign fund and I never heard a word from her now they put me in
[49:47.120 --> 49:53.120]  prison but listen to what I'm telling you she was controlled the attorney general
[49:53.120 --> 49:58.120]  United States was controlled the CIA and anybody listening to this FBI come on
[49:58.120 --> 50:02.120]  and pick up Jim Travagan I'm on probation right here on Alex Jones show I'm
[50:02.120 --> 50:07.120]  saying that she was a lesbian she was in fact appointed an assistant prosecutor
[50:07.120 --> 50:12.120]  in Dade County the cocaine capital of America she was ultimately after the
[50:12.120 --> 50:18.120]  prosecutor resigned appointed the prosecutor in one reelection now that's
[50:18.120 --> 50:24.120]  what I knew about but I can guarantee you there are people in Washington that
[50:24.120 --> 50:28.120]  are afraid to say anything because of their background there are people who
[50:28.120 --> 50:32.120]  are afraid and this is this is the thing I don't like and this is the thing
[50:32.120 --> 50:36.120]  congressman I've got interrupt I'm skipping a network break this break
[50:36.120 --> 50:40.120]  belongs to the network station should not run over this I'm skipping the break
[50:40.120 --> 50:45.120]  for time go ahead congressman okay the bottom line is I don't know if you
[50:45.120 --> 50:51.120]  remember but Jane Harmon from California was picked up on a voice recorder of
[50:51.120 --> 50:55.120]  promising American Israeli public affairs committee they should get their two
[50:55.120 --> 50:58.120]  spies out of prison if they use their influence to make her the chairman of
[50:58.120 --> 51:02.120]  the intelligence committee that was on the news yeah but it was hidden away
[51:02.120 --> 51:08.120]  real fast and it was hidden away real good but do you know that the two spies
[51:08.120 --> 51:13.120]  ultimately turned loose by by our Attorney General Holder and he said we're
[51:13.120 --> 51:18.120]  not sure that they had bad intent well keep in mind Alex that the man that
[51:18.120 --> 51:22.120]  they were working with in a Pentagon Larry Franklin is still in prison for 12
[51:22.120 --> 51:27.120]  years for giving secrets and what their efforts were they were attempting to
[51:27.120 --> 51:33.120]  mobilize the Pentagon to attack Iran look enough is enough everybody's
[51:33.120 --> 51:39.120]  afraid down there Alex and I don't like is the IRS has thousands of times
[51:39.120 --> 51:43.120]  testified before congressman said the only weapon we have to collect
[51:43.120 --> 51:50.120]  voluntary taxes is the element of fear Alex how does fear and the word fear
[51:50.120 --> 51:55.120]  and the process of fear even enter into the bill of right and the declaration
[51:55.120 --> 52:01.120]  of independence my god what has happened to us Alex well congressman I did the
[52:01.120 --> 52:06.120]  research at the time I know it was in two major Florida papers that she was
[52:06.120 --> 52:11.120]  actually caught when she was just a prosecutor so drugged out on alcohol and
[52:11.120 --> 52:16.120]  pills vomiting in the back of a car in a parking garage with a 13-year-old girl
[52:16.120 --> 52:20.120]  it also came out and I believe it was lawsuits and pull this up that she would
[52:20.120 --> 52:26.120]  go check out kids that had been CPS from the CPS did you ever see that info
[52:26.120 --> 52:31.120]  now the information that I had was that the powers to be and the cocaine business
[52:31.120 --> 52:37.120]  had photographs of her with young ladies in compromising situations and she was
[52:37.120 --> 52:42.120]  she was really ineffective and impotent in anything she had tried to do the
[52:42.120 --> 52:46.120]  thing that I the reason that I got so involved with Janet Reno is she
[52:46.120 --> 52:50.120]  testified before congress about Waco that they did everything not to push
[52:50.120 --> 52:55.120]  David Koresh over the edge listen no one got more information than me on that
[52:55.120 --> 52:59.120]  case Alex and listen to this David Koresh went jogging every morning and went
[52:59.120 --> 53:03.120]  for lunch and went for breakfast in the local town they could have arrested him
[53:03.120 --> 53:07.120]  in town there have been no problem they wanted that speech they wanted that
[53:07.120 --> 53:11.120]  speech to try and change the IRS law of this exemptions for these church related
[53:11.120 --> 53:15.120]  activities and it blew up in their face but when she testified that congressman
[53:15.120 --> 53:19.120]  say we didn't want to pressure him and push him over the edge I wasn't on that
[53:19.120 --> 53:23.120]  committee or I'd asked her this question then my god why did you have strobe lights
[53:23.120 --> 53:28.120]  on that building all night and played the recordings of dying
[53:28.120 --> 53:33.120]  rabbits at the screaming decibel level so high it was heard in villages five
[53:33.120 --> 53:37.120]  miles away if you didn't want to push anybody over the edge she lied but the
[53:37.120 --> 53:42.120]  thing that bothered me is we had a general the red Chinese army Alex that
[53:42.120 --> 53:47.120]  gave ten million dollars to the Clinton campaign and she never investigated she
[53:47.120 --> 53:52.120]  said it wasn't worth even investigation now my god we have China right now
[53:52.120 --> 53:56.120]  that is controlling much of the money supply in America they're controlling
[53:56.120 --> 54:00.120]  the commerce and trade of America you have Israel that's controlling the national
[54:00.120 --> 54:04.120]  and international policies of America where the health of the American people
[54:04.120 --> 54:09.120]  come in and why isn't anybody saying it well this is an incredible
[54:09.120 --> 54:13.120]  interview with James Travick and I know you're on the road right now traveling
[54:13.120 --> 54:17.120]  and if you can't do it it's fine we're gonna break her in about five minutes for
[54:17.120 --> 54:20.120]  one minute can we have an extra additional five minutes with you I'll be
[54:20.120 --> 54:24.120]  I'll be be honored and let me tell you something I am concerned about you but
[54:24.120 --> 54:28.120]  you're making one hell of an impact well I'm concerned about you and everybody
[54:28.120 --> 54:32.120]  else that has courage and God bless you again Jim Travick and is our guest and
[54:32.120 --> 54:36.120]  you're going back to Waco briefly I remember the FLIR footage of the Bradley
[54:36.120 --> 54:42.120]  fighting vehicles with the troops firing their assault rifles and it came out
[54:42.120 --> 54:48.120]  the Delta Force was there it was in Time Magazine that Israeli troops of all
[54:48.120 --> 54:52.120]  and British troops were there as a congressman who was there during those
[54:52.120 --> 54:58.120]  investigations what's your intel on that it was a joke the way the mainstream
[54:58.120 --> 55:02.120]  media actually turned it around where many Americans at their dinner table was
[55:02.120 --> 55:07.120]  saying they got just what they deserve down there in Texas my god Alex there
[55:07.120 --> 55:13.120]  were 17 kids incinerated children incinerated in that building I had seen
[55:13.120 --> 55:17.120]  films of it where many of those guns and many of those heavy artillery was
[55:17.120 --> 55:21.120]  right aimed right at the exit point where no one was coming out of there
[55:21.120 --> 55:27.120]  look Janet Reno and the Justice Department should have gone to prison
[55:27.120 --> 55:32.120]  over that and another one was very bad now so you're not a white supremacist
[55:32.120 --> 55:36.120]  and you're not a racist I know that neither am I but this fellow Randy Weaver
[55:36.120 --> 55:40.120]  out there in Idaho they shot his wife holding their infant child right between
[55:40.120 --> 55:45.120]  the eyes of marksmen killed it killed a dog and killed his 14 year old boy I
[55:45.120 --> 55:49.120]  made a speech every week until they settled and he ended up settling for about
[55:49.120 --> 55:54.120]  five million dollars with the government but they did that and they entangled
[55:54.120 --> 55:59.120]  that man because he was supposedly a white supremacist and was a political
[55:59.120 --> 56:03.120]  target United States government look I'm not into any white supremacist black
[56:03.120 --> 56:08.120]  supremacist black fire business I'm for a straight and honest American society
[56:08.120 --> 56:13.120]  but regardless of what your politics are I don't think that you should be singled
[56:13.120 --> 56:18.120]  out well I know Weaver he was a former special forces they wanted to be an
[56:18.120 --> 56:23.120]  informant against the Aryan nations we'd only visited once he was quote
[56:23.120 --> 56:27.120]  separating himself from society none of that was even true and when he wouldn't
[56:27.120 --> 56:31.120]  go be an informant for them they went and did what they did yeah it was a shame
[56:31.120 --> 56:35.120]  what they did is they came to him and trapped them to cut the saw off two
[56:35.120 --> 56:38.120]  barrels off shotguns he said why don't you do it they said well you know we
[56:38.120 --> 56:40.120]  don't want to get into that we don't know what we're doing you know you know
[56:40.120 --> 56:44.120]  and they entrapped the guy but the way they come in with a SWAT team and the way
[56:44.120 --> 56:48.120]  to destroy that family but see this is what America is not seeing they're not
[56:48.120 --> 56:52.120]  seeing the other side of the one eye jack let me tell you something Alex and
[56:52.120 --> 56:56.120]  that's seven and a half years in prison I'm probably more knowledgeable than
[56:56.120 --> 57:00.120]  anyone that ever served in Congress that isn't self-serving because I've seen
[57:00.120 --> 57:04.120]  the other side of this thing and see I know what you're talking about you're
[57:04.120 --> 57:09.120]  very unpopular in the nation's capital but your popularity is growing because
[57:09.120 --> 57:13.120]  people know you're telling the truth and you're touching you're touching
[57:13.120 --> 57:18.120]  subjects that people are afraid to even comment on this is what bothers me do we
[57:18.120 --> 57:22.120]  have freedom of speech in America well do we have my sir men I mean I'm not
[57:22.120 --> 57:26.120]  looking for trouble but I can't control myself when I see corruption and people
[57:26.120 --> 57:30.120]  being oppressed I've got to stand up against it and I quite frankly don't
[57:30.120 --> 57:34.120]  don't give a damn if they kill me I don't want that to happen but I'm committed
[57:34.120 --> 57:37.120]  well let me tell you something the truth of the matter is there are a lot of
[57:37.120 --> 57:41.120]  Americans like you and they don't have the microphone and they respect the
[57:41.120 --> 57:45.120]  hell out of you for it that's why you have a tremendous responsibility you have
[57:45.120 --> 57:49.120]  a tremendous responsibility with the pressure you're going to be getting and
[57:49.120 --> 57:54.120]  after having an interview with Jim Travagan my god they're going to have
[57:54.120 --> 57:59.120]  their antenna up completely but what I'm saying are things that I know that I've
[57:59.120 --> 58:04.120]  investigated myself and when I brought a man home off a death row for mass
[58:04.120 --> 58:09.120]  murder and Israel called me at my hotel in Jerusalem and said he'll be in
[58:09.120 --> 58:13.120]  Tel Aviv tomorrow night congressman take him home that tells you that I got the
[58:13.120 --> 58:20.120]  right information and the government knew it and then you're demonized and they
[58:20.120 --> 58:24.120]  set you up and put you in prison we're going to come back I'm sorry to the
[58:24.120 --> 58:28.120]  callers it's just that all the info he keeps bringing out I want to get every
[58:28.120 --> 58:32.120]  minute we can because he was in the middle of all of this in Congress for so long
[58:32.120 --> 58:35.120]  but we'll see about going to your calls regardless I'll get to him and come back

[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:33.120]  one of the top trends forecasters on the globe with us for the next hour
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:37.120]  he normally only can join us once a month because he's so busy doing international
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:41.120]  television and print interviews but he's come back just after two weeks from the
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:45.120]  last visit because his prediction about Pakistani terrorists come through his
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:48.120]  prediction about massive riots intensifying they made two years ago
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:53.120]  about Greece is now unfolding his prediction about the plunging stock
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:57.120]  market is now unfolding and another gentleman who's been right on target
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:01.120]  Bob Chapman of the international forecaster he's joining us in one hour
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:07.120]  as well now in the first hour I did not get into what I believe went on
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:13.120]  yesterday mainly because I'm still studying but I do agree with CNBC
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:18.120]  headline that is ridiculous this really sounds like market manipulation to me
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:26.120]  nine stocks simultaneously went down this was not some fat finger we know
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:30.120]  the plunge protection team manipulates the market now was this Europe plunging
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:34.120]  and their markets being closed triggering this or was this insider trading
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:40.120]  which we know the major trade commission the groups that are over the stock
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:44.120]  exchanges I mean made off founded the Nasdaq we know they're constantly
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:49.120]  involved in stuff like this but they're getting really bold now if this is a
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:53.120]  premeditated fraud we know they jacked the market back up almost a thousand
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:56.120]  points in just minutes that's never happened it's never dropped a thousand
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:59.120]  or been jacked up this fast so we know there's manipulation we know the
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:04.120]  story about fat fingers as a cover but we I don't know specifically yet
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:08.120]  exactly what happened we know it staged we just don't know specifically why
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:12.120]  we'll see if Gerald Salente and Bob Chapman do Gerald Salente good to have
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:19.120]  you here with us hey thanks joining us via video Skype from New York State
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:23.120]  let's talk about what just happened with the stock market then we'll get into
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:29.120]  Greece well it's the crash of 2010 as we had forecast at the beginning of this
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:35.120]  year and what's happening is the stimulus money is running out worldwide
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:39.120]  and when a time that there is a trigger like Greece or something else the
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:44.120]  market is going to decline as you will point it out we know these it's a
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:49.120]  rig game how it was rigged and who rigged it or that that that will never
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:54.120]  really get to the bottom of it we never know the truth of those things but I do
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:59.120]  believe that the market is unraveling and what they did do yesterday is they
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:05.120]  came in to and pulled out all the stops to jack it back up from not crashing
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:09.120]  and they're going to do it for a number of days they're doing it globally
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:17.120]  there's no stopping the meltdown the markets collapsed Alex in March of
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:25.120]  2009 what they did was they pumped them up with all of the stimulus money it's
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:35.120]  as simple as that it's all of Europe the United States the UK India China
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:43.120]  China with its free lending policies and stimulus Japan South Korea it's
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:48.120]  worldwide now it's running out just as we're seeing these phony unemployment
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:54.120]  numbers coming out they're only juiced up by the stimulus money when the
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:04:00.120]  stimulus runs out the markets crash the markets are now crashing now so here's
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:05.120]  the game the inside and trading starts happening the big guys start pulling it
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:10.120]  out because they know what's coming next they jack it back up and then they
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:15.120]  get the shills out there to say listen this is a good buying opportunity the
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:20.120]  market is only going through a correction we have a lot of fundamental
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:25.120]  strength in the economy and they sucker the people back in so anyone that
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:31.120]  thinks that this is going to be a market that's going to grow in strength

[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:41.120]  three years ago the stock market plunge of two thousand and eight a year and a
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:45.120]  half before a year and a half after before what happened in greece you
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:49.120]  predicted it would start in greece portugal spain now they're saying
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:53.120]  england has his bigger debt ratio so does the u.s. they're announcing a
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:58.120]  global implosion the banks we know are engineering this and hijacking
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:03.120]  countries so break down where you see this going and what's happening with
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:09.120]  the markets and the next shoe to drop well the next shoe to drop appears to
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:15.120]  be happening again in europe first of all the what's going on in greece is
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:21.120]  going to explode into social unrest worldwide the people are not going to
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:27.120]  take it i love the white shoe boy language they use the average person
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:34.120]  has to suffer through their austerity measures so they could bail out who is
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:40.120]  it that's holding the bonds it's these huge hedge funds and banks they can't
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:45.120]  give them here's their language a haircut what do you mean you can't give
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:50.120]  them a haircut oh no they won't even get a trim you have to cover the losses in
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:55.120]  the united states the people to accept that a lot quicker than they do in
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:11:00.120]  europe the europeans know the story and they're not going to let it happen the
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:08.120]  next shoe to fall probably spain portugal then italy the uk is in terrible
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:15.120]  trouble we're going to see sovereign defaults around the world it's happened
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:21.120]  before and it's happened again let's make this one hundred percent clear the
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:27.120]  only people that are getting bailed out are the two big they're not allowed to
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:34.120]  lose any money always under the guise that if we lose money the whole world
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:40.120]  system will collapse it's kind of like alex did you hear president obama
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:47.120]  recently when he addressed the wall street crowd a couple of weeks ago he
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:55.120]  called them the titans of industry what industry they're not making cars they're
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:12:00.120]  not producing steel or building railroads the only thing they make are
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:05.120]  profits and they're not titans of industry you know who they are their
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:12.120]  bookies call it what it is but they're super bookies these are guys that not
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:20.120]  only are touts at the racetrack they also field the horses thoroughbreds that
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:27.120]  are really nags credit default swap auction rate security that's all they
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:35.120]  are synthetic credit default swaps special investment vehicles the whole
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:40.120]  fraudulent system is collapsing and the governments are going to crack down on
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:47.120]  the little people so they can pay off the gambling debts made by the big
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:53.120]  losses number two as the markets collapse what they're going to do the big
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:59.120]  guys are going to bail out as I have mentioned what they'll say is that the
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:04.120]  markets are rebounding I can't make this stuff up as I said to you just several
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:10.120]  minutes earlier they're going to say this is a good buying opportunity well
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:15.120]  between the time I said that and the break that happened to now I just heard
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:23.120]  the clowns on CNBC say it's a great buying opportunity to jump into the stock
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:30.120]  markets in Europe oh yeah it's a great opportunity to jump on to the Lusitania
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:36.120]  it's going to have a lovely trip across the ocean anybody that buys into the
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:43.120]  markets or that buys into these lies deserves what they get
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:48.120]  Gerald I'm just speechless here as you go over this I mean we have the Goldman
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:53.120]  Sachs internal emails we have the JP Morgan internal info they premeditated
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:14:00.120]  Lee going back four years ago sold government sold pension funds sold private individuals
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:04.120]  derivatives that they knew were worthless while they were preparing to bet against
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:10.120]  them and in their own emails they say this will destroy our competition but the
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:14.120]  media is only focusing on the Timberwolf emails with Goldman Sachs when the
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:18.120]  others are far worse and now they're announcing don't worry we're engaged in
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:24.120]  financial terrorism give us unlimited trillions and will you know bring back
[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:28.120]  the good times but then separately two weeks ago in the Washington Post the
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:33.120]  head of the IMF bragged he said for rich nations this was the headline the
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:37.120]  good times are over the party's over you're not going to be able to retire
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:41.120]  we're going to take your pension funds they're getting ready for it here you
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:45.120]  know our media won't say why the Greeks are rioting they just say austerity but
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:50.120]  when we talk about austerity Gerald Salente explained to people what austerity
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:55.120]  means under these made-off types well what it means is is that everybody's
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:15:01.120]  standard of living declines they tax you to death they make it more and more
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:06.120]  impossible for small people to get into businesses because they put more and
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:11.120]  more charges on top of them and direct all the business to the big guys let's
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:16.120]  make this really clear about this bailout going through Greece number one
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:23.120]  it's against the econ the European Monetary Union charter that any bailouts
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:30.120]  number two it's explicitly against the European Monetary Union charter for an
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:37.120]  IMF bailout who's the biggest funder of the IMF us we the people of the
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:44.120]  United States we're the people that are now bailing out the banks the JP Morgan
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:51.120]  Chase the Goldman Sachs gang the Merrill Lynch more the Credit Suisse where is
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:56.120]  all this money going to it's going to the bankers number one it's against the
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:16:02.120]  economic the European Monetary Union and number two now we're footing the bill
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:07.120]  so these guys can get bailed out what you're seeing happening in Greece with
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:13.120]  the people taking to the streets is going to happen worldwide I want to make
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:20.120]  this very clear because Alex this is going to lead one of the elements
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:26.120]  leading to the great war systems are going to be breaking down they're not
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:30.120]  going to be able to stop the people any more than they're able to stop them in
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:35.120]  Thailand Thailand hardly makes the news people don't know anything of what's
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:40.120]  going on there you've heard me say this over and over again my expression as a
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:45.120]  Bronx guy is when people lose everything and they have nothing left to lose
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:50.120]  they're losing it and they're going to be losing it against the red carpet crowd
[01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:55.120]  who believe that they are the entitled people that they could fix everything if
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:17:00.120]  only you give them anything everything and I want to add something to that
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:04.120]  because the magnitude of this fraud with banker bailouts they're not bailouts
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:10.120]  they make money on the way up selling the crowd then when the governments and
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:15.120]  companies and pension funds that have bought the fraud start imploding the
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:19.120]  government gives taxpayer money as a bailout to the private banks that
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:26.120]  engineered the fraud to then lend the money to the government or to the
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:30.120]  pension fund that's now bankrupt and then now those pension funds are even in
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:35.120]  more debt to the same bankers that engineered it so to quantify this we
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:42.120]  loan the banks the money that they then loan us back I mean this is fraud on
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:50.120]  top of fraud on top of fraud and you notice that as soon as they agreed to the
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:55.120]  146.5 billion for Greece that suddenly Portugal and Spain started going under
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:18:00.120]  because the bank said look they bought this now let's trigger it here and so
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:04.120]  they're holding all of his hostage and they own the mainstream media and so the
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:09.120]  mainstream media most of the time will not tell the truth Dylan Radigan does
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:13.120]  occasionally they let Ron Paul on sometimes to tell the truth but I mean
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:17.120]  here's the Washington Post headline for nations living the good life the party
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:23.120]  is over IMF says Washington Post but I mean going back to that the level of
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:32.120]  well that was crazy that sounded like one of those party party horns I guess we
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:36.120]  lost Gerald Salente that happens occasionally with the video Skype
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:41.120]  connections so we're going to connect back to Gerald Salente and continue along
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:47.120]  those lines with our guests today special effects brought to you by Skype I
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:51.120]  guess we have Gerald back we don't okay we're going to go to break in a moment
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:56.120]  and I'm going to bring that question back to him after the break it isn't just
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:19:02.120]  that the banks sell derivatives and then the economy implodes and then we have to
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:06.120]  bail the nations out when you read about this Greek plan or the US plan what
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:14.120]  happened in England in the last wave our money then goes to the banks Gerald you
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:17.120]  got caught off we're going to break but starting answering the question about how
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:23.120]  we loaned them our money to loan back to us yeah but you see you left one element
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:29.120]  out Alex you have to be fair about this they give the government all of their toxic
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:37.120]  crap as collateral that's what they use as the sham to make it legitimate and
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:41.120]  that's what's been going on the governments around the world have been
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:47.120]  using this lie that they have collateral so that they can then loan the banks
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:52.120]  money at near zero interest rates so that the banks could go out back out
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:20:00.120]  we loaned to us and continuing their gamble stay there we got to go to break

[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:27.120]  but we love the directions you know the spin the wheel directions that people
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:30.120]  take us in the different angles that we wouldn't have thought of I want to pick
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:35.120]  his brain here today one eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one one
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:39.120]  eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one but Gerald you make a great
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:45.120]  point I can't even properly describe how big the fraud is they sell the
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:49.120]  derivatives knowing it's crap they have insurance companies certify it the
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:53.120]  insurance companies get bailed out after they already get paid to certify it
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:58.120]  the big banks get to fence the assets and buy real assets when the bubbles
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:03.120]  being inflated them when it implodes the banks get bailed out with trillions
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:07.120]  of dollars and then they say all but we're going to give the governments the
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:11.120]  toxic assets and every economist we've talked to have said that those have
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:15.120]  negative value so they're actually giving the governments a time bomb so it's
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:20.120]  a triple screw job that's right and let's not forget the rating agencies as
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:25.120]  you mentioned you know they get a free ride as well they're getting paid to rate
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:30.120]  the junk and they rate the junk excellent you can't get away with this in
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:36.120]  real life and I've said this over and over again the merger of state and
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:41.120]  corporate powers is called fascism and fascism has come to America we're
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:46.120]  talking about the financial sector we could talk about it in agriculture we
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:52.120]  could talk about it in pharmaceutical we can talk about it in retail every
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:59.120]  sector of this country is controlled by a handful what is it Alex six banks
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:06.120]  controlling 60% of all of the action in the country how can you deny what's
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:13.120]  going on you can't this is not socialism and I heard you talking about
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:18.120]  before I came on the air about these drug busts and how they use these
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:24.120]  fascist tactics to beat up people to beat up the little guy for you know
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:30.120]  smoking a joint while they let the big guys free and turn quote a blind eye
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:36.120]  to oprium production in Afghanistan because they don't want to hurt the family
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:41.120]  farmers income who are they kidding with this stuff so what we're looking at is
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:48.120]  really a complete takeover and when people say why isn't the government doing
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:53.120]  anything they think that there's a revolving door that's the story that
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:57.120]  they've been fed well you know the people go out of government and then into
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:02.120]  these private corporations and they you know they have an inside track it's
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:09.120]  not a revolving door it's a wide open door and that door is filled with the
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:15.120]  same people in every agency that are fronting for the big corporations
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:20.120]  whether it's the Goldman Sachs gang or whether it's agriculture it's the same
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:27.120]  story over and over again well look at Walmart globally has 46% of all retail
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:32.120]  sales and it's all based on Chinese slave goods what about Mark Faber I know
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:36.120]  you respect his opinion he's got a very good track record of predicting things
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:40.120]  just in the market so you have you know general analysis which is so important
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:45.120]  but he's saying 90% chance in the next 9 to 12 months that China will
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:51.120]  completely collapse into depression we've been saying this as well as the Chinese
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:57.120]  bubble everyone knows that the one of the major reasons why we have recovered
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:04.120]  with this fake recovery from the March 2009 equities market collapse is because
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:10.120]  of China and China has dumped in nearly a trillion dollars worth of money
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:15.120]  plus they're loaning out money all over they have a huge housing bubble going on
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:22.120]  there and I do respect Mark Faber's analysis as Bob Chapman's as well and
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:27.120]  Faber's right on the money with this because there's another problem going on
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:32.120]  in China and again this is where we look at a bit differently than a lot of others
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:39.120]  and that is the social unrest they've had over 70,000 major riots and
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:48.120]  disturbances in China in 2009 they have to keep their 1.2 billion people happy
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:54.120]  because if they don't the whole thing turns to chaos and it's going to be chaos
[01:28:54.120 --> 01:29:01.120]  in China as the world economies decline and they have no place to dump their product
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:06.120]  so yes we agree there's going to be a major unraveling in China
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:10.120]  now we're about to break long segment coming up we'll take some calls and get
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:15.120]  into other trends but I've got a Twitter question to the real Alex Jones Twitter
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:20.120]  by Ferrara it says I'd like to know if he has the same forecast for financial
[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:24.120]  collapse that he had one year ago have things changed or have things
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:27.120]  accelerated well let me just answer that question and then have him come back
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:32.120]  and elaborate he said almost four years ago that in 2008 there'd be a huge
[01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:36.120]  implosion that's on record and he described it in the subprime mortgages
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:42.120]  as the trigger then he said right after the bailout in 2008 that 2010
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:46.120]  and Chapman said this too that the money would run out and then the big
[01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:50.120]  implosion would start we'll be back
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:59.120]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:04.120]  in March Alex Jones announced that eFoodsDirect was putting together a high
[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:08.120]  volume pre-production order of the new quick fix meals by waiting for
[01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:12.120]  production and shipping of their orders families were able to receive one free
[01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:16.120]  item for every three that they bought since the final shutdown of this buy

[01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:23.120]  and get into the next phase in the collapse how he sees this historically unwinding and unfolding
[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:28.120]  Bob Chapman will also join us next hour to specifically borrow in to his research
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:33.120]  I know he's on it to find out exactly what happened yesterday the word is there was a lot of people
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:39.120]  that were short on gold in Europe and that they had to dump stock to be able to cover their position
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:44.120]  and we know it wasn't a fat finger it wasn't Procter and Gamble that's even CNBC admits
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:50.120]  it was at least nine stocks simultaneously that did this and they halted trading in Europe
[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:56.120]  a lot of chicanery we have a specialist on that issue alone Bob Chapman joining us next hour
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:34:03.120]  before we go back to our guest we produced and released two new films in the month of April
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:08.120]  I released of course Invisible Empire in order to find which is just excellent
[01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:13.120]  exposing the new world order the global government who these people are how to stop them
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:19.120]  government drug dealing government kidnapping white slavery how they're bribing people how they're controlling them
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:25.120]  what the banks are doing and police state for the rise of FEMA how they're planning to suppress the people
[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:29.120]  training to take on the tea parties training the military to take on the American people
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:33.120]  the reality of the FEMA camps it's all proven in police state for the rise of FEMA
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:38.120]  but remember William Lewis who made camp FEMA and a lot of other great films with Gary Franchi
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:44.120]  they have released a new film I've got it here in stock we can't start shipping it till the 16th or 17th
[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:50.120]  it officially comes out the 17th but that's just a week away a little more than a week away about eight nine days away
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:56.120]  if you want it first we're going to ship this out UPS or postal service however you order it and your purchase supports us
[01:34:56.120 --> 01:35:03.120]  but that's not what's important here that's not what's important okay supporting us is secondary
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:10.120]  this film exposes the 9th and 10th amendment powers the state's rights rebellion in fact I have the Republican party
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:16.120]  calling for basically the states to say no to the new world order today and starting a states rights task force
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:28.120]  the point is I'm in there Michael Bagnarek Dr. Edwin Vieira so many other great political minds about how to take the states back
[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:33.120]  this is a key handbook so people know the difference between a democracy and a constitutional republic
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:41.120]  this is such an important film don't tread on me you can preorder it now at infowars.com you can also watch the newest trailer
[01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:51.120]  because William Lewis has authorized us to make a infowars.com centric trailer that's up on infowars.com that's up on the Alex Jones channel

[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:29.120]  and have you finished the twitter question we mentioned before the break before we do that information is power
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:34.120]  Christ said the people perish for lack of knowledge we're here to try to give them the knowledge
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:40.120]  the guest I have on this show are the people that are consistently right not the people that are consistently wrong
[01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:45.120]  the people that will tell the truth the people that are constitutionalist like yourself
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:53.120]  and your trends journal is invaluable many of the biggest corporations on earth you consulted for
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:59.120]  and subscribe to it the people need the trends journal how do folks get it

[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:27.120]  absolutely and again give that website out one more time
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:32.120]  trendsresearch.com that's with an S plural trendsresearch
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:36.120]  okay Bob Chapman's coming up and I want to try to keep you five minutes to the next hours
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:41.120]  every second we can with you now to go through calls and Twitter questions
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:48.120]  but going back to this first Twitter question that I posed as we went to break
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:55.120]  I'd like to know if he has the same forecast for financial collapse that he had one year ago have things changed
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:38:00.120]  so you've been dead on about exactly what would happen even the countries where it would start
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:06.120]  do you want to revise that any because you have new info and and then I will add the caveat the proviso
[01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:10.120]  and what do you see coming in the year after that what comes next
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:16.120]  here it is it's this came out on when it was released in January 13th the top trend
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:24.120]  the crash of 2010 we stick with our forecast before the new year begins
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:30.120]  no one will be able to deny that the great equity markets have crashed
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:34.120]  the currencies are being devalued around the world
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:39.120]  gold prices are well over fifteen hundred dollars
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:46.120]  we are sticking with our forecast that the markets will crash before the year is out
[01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:52.120]  and I also want to make this very clear it's not only going to be a financial crash
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:55.120]  it's going to come from a lot of different directions
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:39:03.120]  our greatest fear and we've said this when they began the great bailout bubble in March of 2009
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:07.120]  is that when all else fails they take you to war
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:15.120]  so what we our scenario is this Alex we're going to see 9-11 magnitude terror strikes happen
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:24.120]  when they happen the last time they happen after 2001 they closed Wall Street down for several days
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:30.120]  if you had CDs you couldn't cash them in their financial instruments
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:37.120]  this time they're going to close the banks and when they reopen the banks we forecast
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:43.120]  they will have devalued the dollar so they'll say don't worry about it
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:47.120]  you'll be able to get your money out it's backed by the FDIC
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:51.120]  but you can't get it out all at once and when you do get it out
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:55.120]  it's not going to be worth a fraction of what it was before
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:40:00.120]  so these are the integrated systems that we're looking at and I'm saying this
[01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:04.120]  so that people take proactive measures now
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:12.120]  don't wait to wake up one day as you did yesterday and see the markets collapse around you
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:16.120]  take proactive measures now it doesn't cost anything
[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:23.120]  but if you don't plan for the worst now and the worst happens then you'll lose everything
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:30.120]  if you take measures now and things happen slowly you haven't lost anything you've gained
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:35.120]  so what do we do get a lot of our money out of the bank most people don't even have any money to get out of the bank
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:40.120]  what do you do get some storeable food water get a second job now so you're ready for what's coming
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:44.120]  warn your neighbors so they'll have some respect for you and listen to you
[01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:48.120]  when all this comes true I mean what do we do Gerald
[01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:51.120]  all of those things number one about the neighbors
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:56.120]  like-minded people forming groups in the event the worst happens
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:41:00.120]  then you have a strategy and a plan you can work together
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:06.120]  it's the community keep your money don't spend a dime you don't have to spend
[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:12.120]  especially on junk and eating crappy food cook your own make it better
[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:17.120]  the survival strategies that you talk about with the seeds and the water
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:25.120]  number three any money that you do have I keep it in my own hands why keep it in the bank
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:31.120]  what are you getting from putting it there you're only taking a risk speaking only for myself
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:37.120]  I'm a firm believer in gold 80% of my gold my assets are in gold
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:40.120]  and then people you know I see these comments they say
[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:43.120]  oh Salenty's involved with you know gold companies
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:47.120]  no I'm not I don't take a penny from anybody
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:52.120]  so it's only what I do and what I believe and I've been writing about it for years
[01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:58.120]  and number three or number four I'm a believer in second amendment rights
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:03.120]  make sure your arm for the worst to happen because you're going to see violence
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:08.120]  increase at a very rapid rate so those are the kind of initial things to consider
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:12.120]  grow your own those crisis gardens that you talk about
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:18.120]  the summer is coming upon us you could grow all the food you need to feed your family
[01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:22.120]  and have a lot left over and put it up for the winter
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:29.120]  so anything you can do that Yankee frugality let's go back to the things that made this country
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:35.120]  what it was use it up wear it out make it do do without
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:40.120]  well expanding on that I think about my grandfather on my dad's side
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:46.120]  he would repair his own equipment I mean you talk about MacGyver
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:51.120]  and all those old farmers and ranchers were like that my dad has a lot of those skills
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:56.120]  he won 10th of the skills my dad has he has probably half the skills his father had
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:43:01.120]  and everybody knew even in good times to have storeable food to be prepared to save money
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:07.120]  because they'd gone through the Great Depression and if we had right at 90% of the public
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:11.120]  being rural during the Great Depression and being self-sufficient and still
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:16.120]  major universities have estimated 17 million starved to death over those 10 years
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:22.120]  and now we have 89% being urban and only about 11% being rural
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:27.120]  only half of the rural are somewhat self-sufficient in national studies
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:30.120]  if we have another meltdown depression like that
[01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:34.120]  nobody's going to be able to take care of you the government the banks
[01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:37.120]  they couldn't even help with Katrina they can't even stop an oil leak
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:40.120]  I mean my god we're talking about a road warrior situation
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:44.120]  and I see the reports with their land off half the teachers in some cities
[01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:47.120]  more than half the cops half the sheriff's deputies
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:52.120]  and the half they keep are there in the news being told they're just there to raise revenue
[01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:56.120]  and write tickets for the government so and I'm starting to see a lot of
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:44:02.120]  sheriffs in Texas and Pennsylvania and Ohio say buy guns you've got to protect yourself
[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:08.120]  so we're seeing the veneer of the civilization the rotten paint starting to peel off
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:14.120]  yeah and and you said it about in the old days people knew how to do it themselves
[01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:20.120]  I own I own a 1994 Audi I could buy anything that I want to buy
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:25.120]  I don't want one of those cars I don't want I don't need all those gadgets
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:30.120]  you know kick the addiction and by the way stop wasting your money
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:34.120]  and go into college and getting a degree in business administration
[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:38.120]  and this is a lot of baloney if you're going to go to college
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:44.120]  only do it for a skill that you can get a return on investment
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:47.120]  that's one of the biggest rackets in this country
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:54.120]  we talk about the military industrial complex we talk about big pharma big big food
[01:44:54.120 --> 01:45:01.120]  it's also the college industrial complex this is one of the greatest scams going on in the world
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:09.120]  I love it oh my my son got a scholarship oh not a full scholarship a partial scholarship
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:14.120]  how much is it going to cost oh only about twenty thousand dollars a year
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:17.120]  oh it would have cost forty thousand dollars a year
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:22.120]  yeah you know what it's like it's like going to one of these bazaars in Turkey
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:25.120]  where they give you all you could buy it for this price
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:28.120]  they'll get any dollar that they can get
[01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:32.120]  you're wasting your money sending your kid to school
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:37.120]  if they're not going to get a diploma that's going to buy them a job
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:42.120]  stop this nonsense and put the money to good use
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:46.120]  and if you want to get a skill in business administration
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:50.120]  start as an apprentice working for somebody
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:52.120]  but that's the way it was done that's the way it was done
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:55.120]  I mean I read about the founding fathers and then Andrew Jackson
[01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:58.120]  they were all apprentices that's how they got their law degree
[01:45:58.120 --> 01:46:00.120]  that's how they got their professorship
[01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:04.120]  is that there were a lot of people that wanted to be apprentices
[01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:06.120]  they only took the people that were smart and willing to work
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:10.120]  and that's what built this country was the apprenticeship system
[01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:16.120]  exactly people are wasting these kids are getting out of college with fifty thousand dollars in debt
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:23.120]  and they can't get a job stocking shelves at Walmart at one in the morning
[01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:27.120]  I want to go to calls time goes so fast with Gerald Salente
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:30.120]  man we could spend ten hours with him here
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:33.120]  I want to go to calls and ask you some other questions but quickly
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:37.120]  you've said some terrorist aid some of it's provocative we know that's true
[01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:42.120]  but you said no twenty ten Pakistan is going to start attacking
[01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:47.120]  you said small attacks but also leading to huge attacks as big as nine eleven
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:51.120]  and now we see the situation with Pakistan
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:54.120]  go ahead I mean how did you predict that
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:47:00.120]  it's so easy to see the president Obama the Nobel Peace Prize winner
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:04.120]  and I wonder if Norway is or well spelled backwards
[01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:10.120]  they've expanded that war in Pakistan this brilliant AFPAC strategy
[01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:15.120]  you know these swivel chair generals and secretaries of this and that
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:20.120]  coming up with these wonderful strategies they're going to weed out the Taliban
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:24.120]  and they're going to pay to on the Afghan Pakistan borders
[01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:28.120]  so Pakistan is fighting this huge war
[01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:32.120]  there's the greatest refugee crisis since Rwanda
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:36.120]  they've now announced yesterday CNN one thousand drones
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:40.120]  and it says the kids piloting these by remote are allowed
[01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:44.120]  in fact print that again for me to kill anybody they want with no evidence
[01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:49.120]  they just said that they can just kill anybody who quote acts like a gorilla
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:53.120]  I know these are called extra judicial killings
[01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:57.120]  white shoe boy languages and it's also what it is it's against
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:02.120]  international law so what's happening is president Obama
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:07.120]  has already they think it's thirty four major drone strikes this year
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:12.120]  and by weekly and by the way the CIA is behind it
[01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:15.120]  and they're not supposed to be involved in these kind of things
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:20.120]  so now here's the scenario your family gets killed
[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:23.120]  your relatives are slaughtered maimed
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:27.120]  they've lost everything because of a huge proxy war
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:31.120]  that Washington is fighting in Pakistan
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:35.120]  you think you want to get even has nothing to do with Al Qaeda
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:39.120]  or the Taliban oh it may
[01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:43.120]  but there's other things this is old as the Old Testament
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:46.120]  it's called revenge
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:49.120]  and we're going to see revenge attacks
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:52.120]  and then Alex they come up with this fairy tale
[01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:55.120]  that by waging this war
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:58.120]  we're going to weed out the Taliban and the Al Qaeda
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:01.120]  on these borders of Pakistan and Afghanistan
[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:03.120]  oh yeah are you
[01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:07.120]  how about getting rid of the bloods in the crypts in Los Angeles
[01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:10.120]  just start there before you move around the country
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:14.120]  they can't do that who in their right mind believes these fairy tales
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:17.120]  it's the military industrial complex
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:20.120]  that Eisenhower, that Smedley Butler
[01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:23.120]  and other great Americans warned us about
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:28.120]  and they know that it's going to cause people to attack
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:32.120]  and they want the attacks as a pretext to take our freedoms
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:36.120]  exactly so this is why we're talking about
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:42.120]  the economic collapse coming from many different directions
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:45.120]  because just like now what happened
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:48.120]  the oil spill was all over the news
[01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:54.120]  it drained from the news when the Times Square bomber surfaced
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:58.120]  well you know we've confirmed they were running a drill
[01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:01.120]  that whole thing looks suspicious to me
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:05.120]  but again what they'll do when there's a terrorist strike
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:08.120]  the people will rally behind the president
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:10.120]  look they did it with Bush
[01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:15.120]  92% of the people wanted to go attack Afghanistan
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:19.120]  to bring back Osama bin Laden dead or alive
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:21.120]  it's nine years later
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:25.120]  what did the Iranians have quoted that he said he's in Washington
[01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:27.120]  Gerald we're going to come back and take some calls
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:29.120]  and ask some quick questions
[01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:31.120]  and cover any other trends that you want to discuss there
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:33.120]  Gerald Salente is our guest
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:36.120]  but going out of break I want to come back and have you answer this question briefly
[01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:38.120]  when you talk about a great war
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:40.120]  that's what governments always do when they're imploding
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:43.120]  is they launch a big war World War III style
[01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:45.120]  as a political distraction
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:47.120]  I mean is that what you're basically saying is coming
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:50.120]  we're saying World War III is on the way
[01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:52.120]  the riots in Greece was spread across Europe
[01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:55.120]  was spread east into Ukraine
[01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:57.120]  into Latvia, Estonia
[01:50:57.120 --> 01:51:00.120]  the world is going to be on fire
[01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:03.120]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite
[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:06.120]  are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults
[01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:07.120]  near the Arctic Circle
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:09.120]  did you know that in a real meltdown
[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:12.120]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold
[01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:15.120]  it's true seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:18.120]  and it's possible that could even happen again
[01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:20.120]  so our friends at Solutions from Science
[01:51:20.120 --> 01:51:23.120]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:25.120]  they call it a survival seed bank
[01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:29.120]  and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:31.120]  for you and your family
[01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:32.120]  and here's the best part
[01:51:32.120 --> 01:51:35.120]  these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way
[01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:38.120]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden

[01:51:55.120 --> 01:51:57.120]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item

[01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:29.120]  a quick question
[01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:30.120]  Gerald Salente
[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:32.120]  there's a lot of drum beating
[01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:35.120]  by the FCC, by the media, by the governments of the world
[01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:38.120]  to censor the internet
[01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:42.120]  A, when do you see this World War III thing being launched?
[01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:45.120]  B, do you see them trying to clamp down on the web?
[01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:48.120]  well when it happens they will clamp down on the web
[01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:50.120]  when they lose control
[01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:53.120]  every aspect where they lose control
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:57.120]  they will try to double up and gain more control
[01:54:57.120 --> 01:54:59.120]  the war is happening now
[01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:03.120]  it was announced just two days ago
[01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:08.120]  that President Obama is going to step up the attacks in Pakistan
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:12.120]  from Pakistan it could explode into India
[01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:16.120]  we don't know what Israel is going to do with Iran
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:18.120]  the whole Middle East is up for grabs
[01:55:18.120 --> 01:55:20.120]  there is no peace process
[01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:22.120]  it's only getting worse over there
[01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:24.120]  we can't put a specific date on it
[01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:26.120]  but it's in the making
[01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:28.120]  unless the people really become aware of it
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:33.120]  stand up and step out and speak out
[01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:35.120]  then we're doomed
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:37.120]  let's go to calls Randy in Texas
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:38.120]  thanks for holding go ahead
[01:55:38.120 --> 01:55:40.120]  quick question
[01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:43.120]  what do you recommend ordinary citizens do
[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:46.120]  with their assets, hard assets
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:50.120]  more precisely what type should we get into?
[01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:57.120]  well I'm not allowed by law to provide financial advice
[01:55:57.120 --> 01:55:59.120]  that's why I always make it clear
[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:01.120]  this is what I would do
[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:04.120]  and what I've done and I've said it over and over again
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:05.120]  it's very simple for me
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:08.120]  I buy gold, 80%
[01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:10.120]  the rest of my money I have hedged
[01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:13.120]  I'm in dollars and I'm in Canadian dollars
[01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:16.120]  one goes up the other goes down
[01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:19.120]  all I want is wealth preservation
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:21.120]  gold is my wild card
[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:24.120]  the other one is all I want to do is stay here
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:25.120]  that's right in this game
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:26.120]  gold could be
[01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:27.120]  and this is for me personally
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:29.120]  speculatively it could go way up
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:32.120]  but bottom line it has real intrinsic value
[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:34.120]  and so it is an emergency backup
[01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:35.120]  it's insurance
[01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:37.120]  I'm not looking in this danger zone
[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:39.120]  to have big increases
[01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:40.120]  though gold is doing that
[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:42.120]  I'm looking at wealth preservation
[01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:43.120]  thank you Randy
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:45.120]  Shanky and Georgia you're on the air with
[01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:46.120]  with Gerald Salente
[01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:47.120]  go ahead
[01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:49.120]  hey Alex, thanks
[01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:51.120]  congratulations to you and Gerald
[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:53.120]  for the great success you all are having
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:54.120]  and getting the word out
[01:56:54.120 --> 01:56:56.120]  I really appreciate what you all are doing
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:56:57.120]  my question resolves
[01:56:57.120 --> 01:56:59.120]  y'all were talking about money
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:02.120]  holding cash, taking money out of the bank
[01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:04.120]  a lot of the questions I get are revolved
[01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:06.120]  around full 1Ks and IRAs
[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:09.120]  and with the reflation trade
[01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:12.120]  and the potential of a failed treasury auction
[01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:15.120]  and all the monetization
[01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:18.120]  they have discussed basically
[01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:19.120]  what they're discussing
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:21.120]  in Greece taking over the pension plan
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:24.120]  Gerald do you think they'll take the full 1K
[01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:26.120]  the IRA money's enforced into treasuries
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:28.120]  to keep this country alive
[01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:30.120]  as long as possible
[01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:31.120]  if a war breaks out
[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:34.120]  that could be one of the things that they do
[01:57:34.120 --> 01:57:36.120]  again what they'll use is
[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:38.120]  they'll use a war or a terror attack
[01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:41.120]  to take any draconian measures that they can
[01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:43.120]  and hide behind them
[01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:45.120]  or with Bush with the abrogation
[01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:48.120]  of so many of our rights under the Patriot Act
[01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:51.120]  with the wiretapping on and on and on
[01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:53.120]  yes it becomes a probability
[01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:56.120]  and unfortunately I'm stuck in situations too
[01:57:56.120 --> 01:57:58.120]  I have to put money in IRAs
[01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:00.120]  I get taxed very heavily
[01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:02.120]  I have my money floating out in that as well
[01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:04.120]  but again my strategy is
[01:58:04.120 --> 01:58:07.120]  and I know the downsides believe me
[01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:09.120]  but I have to do something
[01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:12.120]  I have my money in ETFs
[01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:15.120]  as I mentioned both dollars and Canadian
[01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:17.120]  and gold
[01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:19.120]  alright we're going to break here
[01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:20.120]  I would just add that
[01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:22.120]  treasury auctions are already failing
[01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:25.120]  most of the new treasury auctions they have
[01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:28.120]  are not being 100% bought by other institutions
[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:29.120]  or governments
[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:31.120]  the Federal Reserve is coming in and monetizing
[01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:32.120]  part of that debt
[01:58:32.120 --> 01:58:33.120]  correct Gerald Salente?
[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:34.120]  that's correct
[01:58:34.120 --> 01:58:36.120]  alright so the treasury auctions are already failing
[01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:38.120]  that's been going on for what a year and a half
[01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:40.120]  we'll be right back stay with us
[01:58:40.120 --> 01:58:44.120]  America's number one source for independent talk radio
[01:58:44.120 --> 01:58:46.120]  for over a decade
[01:58:46.120 --> 01:58:49.120]  we are the GCN Radio Network
[01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:52.120]  they helped to create a new world order
[01:58:52.120 --> 01:58:54.120]  we are part of a new world order
[01:58:54.120 --> 01:58:57.120]  a new world order based upon collective action
[01:58:57.120 --> 01:59:00.120]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists
[01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:02.120]  through their own words and documents
[01:59:02.120 --> 01:59:04.120]  the new world order really is a tool
[01:59:04.120 --> 01:59:07.120]  for addressing a new world of possibilities
[01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:09.120]  it means all the world under their control
[01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:12.120]  the United Nations would take over America
[01:59:12.120 --> 01:59:15.120]  the Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world
[01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:18.120]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence
[01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:20.120]  have worked in stealth for centuries
[01:59:20.120 --> 01:59:23.120]  to establish an oppressive world government
[01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:26.120]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short
[01:59:26.120 --> 01:59:28.120]  of a world constitution for the global financial system
[01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:31.120]  global governance with the establishment of the G20
[01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:33.120]  so it's going to be an inner ruling elite
[01:59:33.120 --> 01:59:35.120]  and then everyone else
[01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:36.120]  and I got news for you
[01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:37.120]  you're everyone else

[02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:21.120]  Alex Jones
[02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:27.120]  Alright, we have Alex Jones
[02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:29.120]  on a well-deserved day off
[02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:32.120]  he's put together a fabulous mix of interviews
[02:00:32.120 --> 02:00:35.120]  with some of the best guest hosts
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:37.120]  that he's ever had on air today
[02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:39.120]  and I just want to say
[02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:42.120]  it's great to have Alex to give him a day off
[02:00:42.120 --> 02:00:44.120]  he's just always burdens the candle
[02:00:44.120 --> 02:00:47.120]  and we don't want to see anything happen to him
[02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:48.120]  because of that
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:50.120]  he asked me to come in today
[02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:51.120]  because gold is shooting up
[02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:53.120]  I can't believe what I'm seeing
[02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:55.120]  I shouldn't say that
[02:00:55.120 --> 02:00:57.120]  because I predicted that gold to go over its market high
[02:00:57.120 --> 02:00:58.120]  on Monday
[02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:00.120]  when I was doing an interview with Alex here
[02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:01.120]  just back then
[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:02.120]  and it did
[02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:03.120]  I mean right now
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:05.120]  spot gold has gone up
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:09.120]  over $1245 an ounce
[02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:14.120]  today's peak so far is $1248.20
[02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:16.120]  presently right now
[02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:19.120]  gold spot is trading at $1245.80
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:21.120]  so all these things that Gerald Salente
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:22.120]  has been talking about
[02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:24.120]  Bob Chapman
[02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:25.120]  I mean you name it
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:28.120]  just the whole long list of economists
[02:01:28.120 --> 02:01:30.120]  that Alex has had on the air
[02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:33.120]  have predicted that this would happen
[02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:34.120]  and now it is
[02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:35.120]  it's happening right now
[02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:36.120]  as we speak
[02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:40.120]  now last time I was on the air here just a short time ago
[02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:42.120]  I was telling you that there's going to be a shortage
[02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:43.120]  in gold coins
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:44.120]  and silver
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:45.120]  and that's happening now
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:48.120]  just like we had it a couple summers ago
[02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:52.120]  the prices on US eagles in the wholesale market
[02:01:52.120 --> 02:01:53.120]  the prices on double eagles
[02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:56.120]  the coins that are pre-1933
[02:01:56.120 --> 02:01:57.120]  all of that stuff
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:02:00.120]  the premiums are starting to gain against the spot price
[02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:02.120]  that spread is widening
[02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:04.120]  and it's showing up
[02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:06.120]  in the retail market
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:08.120]  I'm having a more difficult time importing
[02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:10.120]  coins from Europe
[02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:11.120]  the francs
[02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:12.120]  the eagle
[02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:13.120]  I'm sorry the franc
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:15.120]  the British sovereign
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:17.120]  is getting to be a scarce item
[02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:20.120]  if we have a movement like this
[02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:22.120]  for any extended period of time
[02:02:22.120 --> 02:02:23.120]  you're going to see
[02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:26.120]  notices going up on websites like Kitco had
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:28.120]  here just a couple short
[02:02:28.120 --> 02:02:30.120]  two short years ago
[02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:32.120]  where they were saying that you would have to wait
[02:02:32.120 --> 02:02:35.120]  30 to 60 days to take delivery
[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:37.120]  of the items that you had purchased
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:40.120]  and that's just the function of the marketplace
[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:41.120]  there is not
[02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:44.120]  and don't even think there's even a slight amount
[02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:46.120]  there's just not enough
[02:02:46.120 --> 02:02:48.120]  physical gold and silver
[02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:50.120]  to go around to meet the demand
[02:02:50.120 --> 02:02:53.120]  for every person that wants to enter into the marketplace
[02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:56.120]  we can serve about one to five percent
[02:02:56.120 --> 02:02:57.120]  of the community
[02:02:57.120 --> 02:02:59.120]  and once it starts to shoot up above that
[02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:02.120]  you see shortages, there's just not enough to go around
[02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:05.120]  Alex asked me to hold on to my special
[02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:06.120]  from yesterday
[02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:08.120]  even though gold again
[02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:10.120]  has gone up another $15
[02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:13.120]  and right now if I price this thing
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:14.120]  for what's going on in the marketplace
[02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:17.120]  I'll be $15 higher a coin
[02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:20.120]  and that's the franc coin at $256.68
[02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:22.120]  that's a fifth of an ounce of gold
[02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:25.120]  that franc coin at $256.68
[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:28.120]  is trading at a great discount to its normal price
[02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:30.120]  and if you buy that coin just one
[02:03:30.120 --> 02:03:32.120]  you're going to get a full year subscription
[02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:35.120]  to Bob Chapman's International Forecaster
[02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:37.120]  and so that's $159 value
[02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:40.120]  it still puts you back in the $500
[02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:42.120]  range for gold
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:45.120]  and with now gold at $1245
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:47.120]  seeing now a resistance level
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:50.120]  that's closer to $1300 an ounce
[02:03:50.120 --> 02:03:51.120]  we're going to see that
[02:03:51.120 --> 02:03:53.120]  I was thinking that might happen this fall
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:56.120]  but now with blowing through this $1245
[02:03:56.120 --> 02:03:59.120]  we could see $1500 an ounce
[02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:01.120]  or even close to even 2000
[02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:03.120]  before we end this year
[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:06.120]  so if you're serious about what you have
[02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:07.120]  in the bank
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:09.120]  where your money is invested
[02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:11.120]  take a look at gold at this particular time
[02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:13.120]  whether if it's in an IRA
[02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:15.120]  or whether if you want to take physical delivery
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:16.120]  it doesn't matter
[02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:18.120]  you really should be calling

[02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:05.120]  a high volume pre-production order

[02:07:53.120 --> 02:07:55.120]  5starsoap.com
[02:07:55.120 --> 02:07:57.120]  for buying a 1-2 month
[02:07:57.120 --> 02:08:17.120]  soap sampler thank you
[02:08:27.120 --> 02:08:29.120]  we have a lot of new developments
[02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:31.120]  that have even ended up in
[02:08:31.120 --> 02:08:33.120]  the few mainstream newspapers the last two weeks
[02:08:33.120 --> 02:08:35.120]  whistleblowers in the US
[02:08:35.120 --> 02:08:37.120]  and England and others coming out with
[02:08:37.120 --> 02:08:39.120]  JP Morgan Chase and others fixing
[02:08:39.120 --> 02:08:41.120]  gold and silver market
[02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:43.120]  now we know this has gone on for a while
[02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:45.120]  but now we are getting specifics
[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:47.120]  and they have been harassed
[02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:49.120]  they have had a lot of problems
[02:08:49.120 --> 02:08:51.120]  since they have been exposing this
[02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:53.120]  we will talk about that
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:55.120]  but this is a big deal because
[02:08:55.120 --> 02:08:57.120]  of the deep manipulation
[02:08:57.120 --> 02:08:59.120]  and the fact that
[02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:01.120]  Goldman Sachs and others were
[02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:03.120]  telling people to invest in
[02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:05.120]  derivatives while they were planning to implode them
[02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:07.120]  by design they have now been indicted for that
[02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:09.120]  you have got more and more coming out
[02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:11.120]  but one of the biggest scams is the suppression
[02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:13.120]  of the gold and silver market
[02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:15.120]  and kind of a reverse carry trade
[02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:17.120]  that they have been using there
[02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:19.120]  and so even if you don't like silver and gold
[02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:21.120]  or aren't into real assets
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:23.120]  this deals
[02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:25.120]  with the overall fraud
[02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:27.120]  and is really a central issue
[02:09:27.120 --> 02:09:29.120]  and so he will be with us for about the next 40 minutes
[02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:31.120]  or so
[02:09:31.120 --> 02:09:33.120]  and he won't have to hurry through his information
[02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:35.120]  so Mr. Murphy
[02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:37.120]  thanks for coming on with us, you have got the floor
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:39.120]  great to be here Alex
[02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:41.120]  one thing that I know some of your listeners
[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:43.120]  may not care about gold and silver
[02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:45.120]  but they certainly care about the economy
[02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:47.120]  and the financial markets
[02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:49.120]  and January 31st 2008
[02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:51.120]  got a place of $264,000
[02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:53.120]  a full page color ad in the Wall Street Journal
[02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:55.120]  which was a couple of months
[02:09:55.120 --> 02:09:57.120]  before everything fell apart
[02:09:57.120 --> 02:09:59.120]  in that ad we talked about catastrophe
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:01.120]  and disaster coming because of
[02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:03.120]  directly
[02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:05.120]  from the suppression of the price of gold
[02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:07.120]  and it has to do with the relationship between gold
[02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:09.120]  and interest rates
[02:10:09.120 --> 02:10:11.120]  and had they let the price of gold trade freely
[02:10:11.120 --> 02:10:13.120]  it would have been much, much higher
[02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:15.120]  would have been more a warning sign
[02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:17.120]  the thermometer would have been off
[02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:19.120]  there wouldn't have been such risk taking
[02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:21.120]  as low as they were for so long
[02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:23.120]  and so it directly affected
[02:10:23.120 --> 02:10:25.120]  every one of your listeners
[02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:27.120]  because they've artificially kept the price of gold
[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:29.120]  way below where it should be
[02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:31.120]  if it's gold it kept pace with inflation
[02:10:31.120 --> 02:10:33.120]  it would be $2,300 an ounce
[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:35.120]  and even trading with platinum
[02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:37.120]  another precious metal used to trade
[02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:39.120]  before the suppression scheme about the same price
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:41.120]  platinum I think is $1,730 today
[02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:43.120]  and gold is something like
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:45.120]  $1,140
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:47.120]  absolutely
[02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:49.120]  the suppression
[02:10:49.120 --> 02:10:51.120]  of gold and silver
[02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:53.120]  is key to their entire derivatives
[02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:55.120]  fraud and allowed them
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:10:57.120]  to do what they've done now
[02:10:57.120 --> 02:10:59.120]  they're now calling for world government
[02:10:59.120 --> 02:11:01.120]  financial taxes
[02:11:01.120 --> 02:11:03.120]  VAT on all banks and institutions
[02:11:03.120 --> 02:11:05.120]  pay to the elite banks
[02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:07.120]  they're involved in all
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:09.120]  or nothing takeover right now
[02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:11.120]  and this information could
[02:11:11.120 --> 02:11:13.120]  bring them down and you're starting to get some major traction
[02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:15.120]  break down how it works
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:17.120]  and the latest information
[02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:19.120]  well the gold antitrust action committee
[02:11:19.120 --> 02:11:21.120]  was formed in January
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:23.120]  1999 by my colleague Chris Powell
[02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:25.120]  myself Chris is the editor of a daily newspaper
[02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:27.120]  and to expose the manipulation
[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:29.120]  of the gold price by a bunch of bullion banks
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:31.120]  like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase
[02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:33.120]  and then we realized
[02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:35.120]  that the government was involved
[02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:37.120]  with also the Fed and the Treasury
[02:11:37.120 --> 02:11:39.120]  and we've been on this 11 years
[02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:41.120]  and we finally got a little daylight
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:43.120]  I was on, somehow I got a C in DC
[02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:45.120]  11 years ago Ron and Son
[02:11:45.120 --> 02:11:47.120]  and that was the last time the American public
[02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:49.120]  heard from me in the mainstream
[02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:51.120]  we've been banned ever since
[02:11:51.120 --> 02:11:53.120]  and we got a break with this
[02:11:53.120 --> 02:11:55.120]  commodity futures trading commission
[02:11:55.120 --> 02:11:57.120]  where there's a great commissioner there
[02:11:57.120 --> 02:11:59.120]  named Bart Shiltman, it was like Elliott Ness
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:01.120]  and he's really trying to do the right thing
[02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:03.120]  and he got me
[02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:05.120]  on the docket to make a presentation
[02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:07.120]  in front of the CFTC
[02:12:07.120 --> 02:12:09.120]  and that was on television
[02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:11.120]  and the only thing that
[02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:13.120]  the TV feed that went down
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:15.120]  was when I was speaking
[02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:17.120]  and as soon as I was done
[02:12:17.120 --> 02:12:19.120]  the feed gets back on, it's very interesting
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:21.120]  because what most people don't know
[02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:23.120]  Chairman Gensler when it started said
[02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:25.120]  we're not going to get into specific allegations
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:27.120]  we don't want to go there
[02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:29.120]  and Bart Shiltman got to live it
[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:31.120]  he went red in the face, he said
[02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:33.120]  are we going to have censorship
[02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:35.120]  and Chairman Gensler back down
[02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:37.120]  and then the TV feed went off
[02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:39.120]  and the concentration of positions
[02:12:39.120 --> 02:12:41.120]  by J.P. Morgan Chase and H.S.B.C.
[02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:43.120]  another big bank are ridiculous
[02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:45.120]  and they're way more than any other
[02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:47.120]  in any other commodity market
[02:12:47.120 --> 02:12:49.120]  in terms of this concentration issue
[02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:51.120]  and we then went on to explain
[02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:53.120]  what the manipulation was all about
[02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:55.120]  and so on so it was quite a show
[02:12:55.120 --> 02:12:57.120]  because there was a whistleblower
[02:12:57.120 --> 02:12:59.120]  who showed up and they wouldn't let him speak
[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:01.120]  he thought he was going to and Andrew
[02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:03.120]  let's stop right there Mr. Murphy
[02:13:03.120 --> 02:13:05.120]  because I want to go over that
[02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:07.120]  for some time on this
[02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:09.120]  but it seemed to backfire
[02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:11.120]  that they cut the TV feed
[02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:13.120]  when you were testifying
[02:13:13.120 --> 02:13:15.120]  because it was recorded
[02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:17.120]  it did end up getting out on the web
[02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:19.120]  and so I mean that really
[02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:21.120]  highlighted what you were saying
[02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:23.120]  for people and then that they wouldn't let the whistleblower speak
[02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:25.120]  I mean there's a serious cover up here
[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:27.120]  go ahead
[02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:29.120]  yeah well there is
[02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:31.120]  and what happened was
[02:13:31.120 --> 02:13:33.120]  this whistleblower Andrew McGuire
[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:35.120]  Adrian Douglas and
[02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:37.120]  we wrote up what Andrew McGuire had to say
[02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:39.120]  and basically he told the CFTC
[02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:41.120]  by emails
[02:13:41.120 --> 02:13:43.120]  three or four or five months in advance
[02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:45.120]  what JP Morgan was going to do ahead of time
[02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:47.120]  he says here's what they're going to do
[02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:49.120]  and when
[02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:51.120]  and it happened and we had these emails
[02:13:51.120 --> 02:13:53.120]  and I read out JP Morgan that their traders
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:55.120]  were laughing at the public and ripping them off
[02:13:55.120 --> 02:13:57.120]  they're making all this money
[02:13:57.120 --> 02:13:59.120]  the public is a bunch of dopes
[02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:01.120]  because they get suckered all the time
[02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:03.120]  they're acting in a collusive action
[02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:05.120]  and so this
[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:07.120]  the emails showed up
[02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:09.120]  with the CFTC and afterwards
[02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:11.120]  I was able to present the press
[02:14:11.120 --> 02:14:13.120]  with these emails and so on
[02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:15.120]  and then the next day Andrew McGuire
[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:17.120]  and his wife were hit by a car
[02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:19.120]  outside of London it was a wild story
[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:21.120]  where he was hit
[02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:23.120]  and then the guy tried to get away
[02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:25.120]  and hit two more cars and it was a helicopter chase
[02:14:25.120 --> 02:14:27.120]  and you can't get much wilder than this
[02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:29.120]  did they catch the guy?
[02:14:29.120 --> 02:14:31.120]  I don't know anything about it since
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:33.120]  dead silence
[02:14:33.120 --> 02:14:35.120]  but they caught him
[02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:37.120]  well I don't know what's happened
[02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:39.120]  this is amazing
[02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:41.120]  again
[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:43.120]  this is really at the foundation
[02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:45.120]  it's like one of the bottom cards
[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:47.120]  in a giant tower of
[02:14:47.120 --> 02:14:49.120]  cards that are about to topple
[02:14:49.120 --> 02:14:51.120]  their manipulation of precious metals
[02:14:51.120 --> 02:14:53.120]  please continue
[02:14:53.120 --> 02:14:55.120]  one of our major issues
[02:14:55.120 --> 02:14:57.120]  especially if we're concerned about
[02:14:57.120 --> 02:14:59.120]  the
[02:14:59.120 --> 02:15:01.120]  one of the people who is actually a critic of ours
[02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:03.120]  we were conservative that basically
[02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:05.120]  the amount of gold and silver
[02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:07.120]  trading a day is 100 to 1
[02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:09.120]  compared to what they actually have there
[02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:11.120]  in London
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:13.120]  in their vaults in gold and silver
[02:15:13.120 --> 02:15:15.120]  we believe at some point
[02:15:15.120 --> 02:15:17.120]  just like what happened with Madoff
[02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:19.120]  and some of these other scandals should a lot of people
[02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:21.120]  all want to go get their gold and silver at the same time
[02:15:21.120 --> 02:15:23.120]  you could end up having a default
[02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:25.120]  and
[02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:27.120]  it's going to get quite wild I believe in the months ahead
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:29.120]  and the major thing is
[02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:31.120]  we've now because of the CFTC
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:33.120]  of parents
[02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:35.120]  according to the mainstream it seems
[02:15:35.120 --> 02:15:37.120]  bizarre to me but I guess that gives us credibility
[02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:39.120]  so now there's a great deal more interest
[02:15:39.120 --> 02:15:41.120]  in what we have to say
[02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:43.120]  and it's spreading all over the world
[02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:45.120]  now in layman's
[02:15:45.120 --> 02:15:47.120]  terms
[02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:49.120]  explain to people
[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:51.120]  why the system wants to suppress gold and silver
[02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:53.120]  and how they do it
[02:15:53.120 --> 02:15:55.120]  there are two ways one with physical gold
[02:15:55.120 --> 02:15:57.120]  which they have to put in the marketplace
[02:15:57.120 --> 02:15:59.120]  they take gold surreptitiously from central banks
[02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:01.120]  and feed it into the system
[02:16:01.120 --> 02:16:03.120]  and then they use it with derivatives
[02:16:03.120 --> 02:16:05.120]  on the Comix
[02:16:05.120 --> 02:16:07.120]  and other financial markets
[02:16:07.120 --> 02:16:09.120]  when they play with the price in the paper market
[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:11.120]  and
[02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:13.120]  the banks make money by flushing the specs out
[02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:15.120]  over the past even though we've been in a 10 year bull market
[02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:17.120]  they do it all the time
[02:16:17.120 --> 02:16:19.120]  pick up $30, $40, $50 at a pop
[02:16:19.120 --> 02:16:21.120]  and for the US government
[02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:23.120]  what happens every time the price of gold
[02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:25.120]  goes nuts
[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:27.120]  people say what it's too much inflation
[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:29.120]  crisis bad for the dollar
[02:16:29.120 --> 02:16:31.120]  it's bad for wall street
[02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:33.120]  it's bad for the politician it's bad for business
[02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:35.120]  a rising gold prices
[02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:37.120]  whether right or wrong
[02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:39.120]  suggests that something's wrong at least that's what the
[02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:41.120]  because it reveals the worthless
[02:16:41.120 --> 02:16:43.120]  fiat nature
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:45.120]  of the hyperinflated
[02:16:45.120 --> 02:16:47.120]  derivative scam
[02:16:47.120 --> 02:16:49.120]  that's also what it does
[02:16:49.120 --> 02:16:51.120]  money and so on
[02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:53.120]  if the gold price were to rally $100 tomorrow
[02:16:53.120 --> 02:16:55.120]  everyone would be jumping up and down
[02:16:55.120 --> 02:16:57.120]  about just what you're talking about
[02:16:57.120 --> 02:16:59.120]  but because they keep knocking it down
[02:16:59.120 --> 02:17:01.120]  there's very little conversation
[02:17:01.120 --> 02:17:03.120]  it's kind of just subdued
[02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:05.120]  continue
[02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:07.120]  I think it's going to get very exciting
[02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:09.120]  when
[02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:11.120]  it's ironic that God is very well known in Russia
[02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:13.120]  but hardly known in all the United States
[02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:15.120]  because we have no free press here
[02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:17.120]  and
[02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:19.120]  the conference in
[02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:21.120]  August of 2005
[02:17:21.120 --> 02:17:23.120]  which one of President Putin's top economic
[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:25.120]  advisors Andre Bykov came
[02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:27.120]  the price of gold was $436
[02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:29.120]  and it wasn't going anywhere
[02:17:29.120 --> 02:17:31.120]  so it was the best conference he was ever at
[02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:33.120]  and two days later the gold price
[02:17:33.120 --> 02:17:35.120]  exploded and rallied $300 in the next nine months
[02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:37.120]  and
[02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:39.120]  at that conference I said
[02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:41.120]  and it was my opinion
[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:43.120]  that it was $436
[02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:45.120]  and the price of gold is going to go to $3 to $5,000
[02:17:45.120 --> 02:17:47.120]  which is what will be needed to clear the market
[02:17:47.120 --> 02:17:49.120]  so we have a long way to go
[02:17:49.120 --> 02:17:51.120]  for any of your listeners that are interested
[02:17:51.120 --> 02:17:53.120]  in what I believe is a great investment
[02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:55.120]  even though we've been up 10 years in a row now
[02:17:55.120 --> 02:17:57.120]  and
[02:17:57.120 --> 02:17:59.120]  clearly though they're losing control
[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:01.120]  because it's gone from $300
[02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:03.120]  to $1,145
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:05.120]  where we stand today
[02:18:05.120 --> 02:18:07.120]  so if you look at the graph
[02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:09.120]  they're able to push the beach ball under water
[02:18:09.120 --> 02:18:11.120]  but then over time it continues
[02:18:11.120 --> 02:18:13.120]  to only go up
[02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:15.120]  well it's a good point
[02:18:15.120 --> 02:18:17.120]  and what we call it
[02:18:17.120 --> 02:18:19.120]  is it's a managed retreat
[02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:21.120]  what they do is they never allow too much excitement
[02:18:21.120 --> 02:18:23.120]  to ever enter the market for example
[02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:25.120]  seven times this year gold has gone up exactly
[02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:27.120]  2%
[02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:29.120]  it's a book called 2% rule
[02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:31.120]  they don't allow it to go up more than that
[02:18:31.120 --> 02:18:33.120]  they work over the shares for example
[02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:35.120]  one of the big funds years ago
[02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:37.120]  Oppenheimer lent to shares to JP Morgan
[02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:39.120]  one of the
[02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:41.120]  Kings of the Gold Cartel
[02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:43.120]  and they work over the share market
[02:18:43.120 --> 02:18:45.120]  so they never allow too much excitement
[02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:47.120]  to enter the picture so gradually
[02:18:47.120 --> 02:18:49.120]  it's like a stealth bull market
[02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:51.120]  some of it was an article the other day
[02:18:51.120 --> 02:18:53.120]  that said 93% of investors
[02:18:53.120 --> 02:18:55.120]  believe gold is going to go down from here
[02:18:55.120 --> 02:18:57.120]  if that isn't bullish I don't know what is
[02:18:59.120 --> 02:19:01.120]  absolutely so 93%
[02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:03.120]  believe that it's going to go up
[02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:05.120]  93% think it's going to go down
[02:19:05.120 --> 02:19:07.120]  in other words the public
[02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:09.120]  is either neutral to bear
[02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:11.120]  by the way, God has been right for the past
[02:19:11.120 --> 02:19:13.120]  10 years about what the price of gold was going to do
[02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:15.120]  yet if you
[02:19:15.120 --> 02:19:17.120]  go look at the
[02:19:17.120 --> 02:19:19.120]  records of the Wall Street firms
[02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:21.120]  they've been neutral to bearish
[02:19:21.120 --> 02:19:23.120]  almost every one of them all the way up
[02:19:23.120 --> 02:19:25.120]  I can't imagine any other sector
[02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:27.120]  or market where Wall Street could be so
[02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:29.120]  and they're still that way today
[02:19:29.120 --> 02:19:31.120]  again to put that in layman's terms
[02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:37.120]  in layman's terms it means that there's nobody bullish
[02:19:37.120 --> 02:19:39.120]  and when markets top out
[02:19:39.120 --> 02:19:41.120]  it's when everyone's bullish and there's too much excitement
[02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:43.120]  and enthusiasm there's almost no enthusiasm
[02:19:43.120 --> 02:19:45.120]  about gold now
[02:19:45.120 --> 02:19:47.120]  exactly but the point is they're always
[02:19:47.120 --> 02:19:49.120]  saying because they're paid to
[02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:51.120]  and they're always wrong that it's going to go down
[02:19:51.120 --> 02:19:53.120]  and it's a bad investment but the people
[02:19:53.120 --> 02:19:55.120]  are ignoring them and they're losing all credibility
[02:19:55.120 --> 02:19:57.120]  stay there let's talk about this whistleblower story
[02:19:57.120 --> 02:20:07.120]  when we get back
[02:20:27.120 --> 02:20:29.120]  and here's the best part
[02:20:29.120 --> 02:20:31.120]  these seeds have not been genetically modified
[02:20:31.120 --> 02:20:33.120]  in any way
[02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:35.120]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant
[02:20:35.120 --> 02:20:37.120]  a full acre crisis garden
[02:20:37.120 --> 02:20:39.120]  so visit them today at

[02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:49.120]  remember
[02:20:49.120 --> 02:20:51.120]  in a real crisis
[02:20:51.120 --> 02:20:53.120]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate
[02:20:53.120 --> 02:20:55.120]  barter item
[02:20:55.120 --> 02:20:57.120]  this is Alex Jones for
[02:20:57.120 --> 02:20:59.120]  survivalseedbank.com
[02:20:59.120 --> 02:21:01.120]  on the average Americans
[02:21:01.120 --> 02:21:03.120]  work between 45 to 50 years
[02:21:03.120 --> 02:21:05.120]  hoping to build up enough wealth to retire
[02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:07.120]  and live out their golden years
[02:21:07.120 --> 02:21:09.120]  unfortunately with taxation
[02:21:09.120 --> 02:21:11.120]  the rising cost of food, energy, housing
[02:21:11.120 --> 02:21:13.120]  and medical many retirees are forced
[02:21:13.120 --> 02:21:15.120]  to live below the poverty line
[02:21:15.120 --> 02:21:17.120]  is this a flaw free enterprise
[02:21:17.120 --> 02:21:19.120]  or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve note
[02:21:19.120 --> 02:21:21.120]  forcing us into perpetual debt

[02:24:09.120 --> 02:24:13.120]  I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
[02:24:13.120 --> 02:24:15.120]  I went down, down, down
[02:24:15.120 --> 02:24:17.120]  and the flames went higher
[02:24:17.120 --> 02:24:20.120]  and it burns, burns, burns
[02:24:20.120 --> 02:24:23.120]  Bill Murphy, the head of Gata
[02:24:23.120 --> 02:24:25.120]  reveals
[02:24:25.120 --> 02:24:27.120]  whistleblower in gold
[02:24:27.120 --> 02:24:29.120]  price suppression is the YouTube video
[02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:31.120]  they cut the TV feed
[02:24:31.120 --> 02:24:33.120]  when he testified and they wouldn't let
[02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:35.120]  Andrew McGuire, the
[02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:37.120]  independent metals trader turn whistleblower
[02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:39.120]  at the center of a storm
[02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:42.120]  for exposing what is the largest fraud in history
[02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:44.120]  Max Kaiser
[02:24:44.120 --> 02:24:47.120]  a year before they took down Iceland
[02:24:47.120 --> 02:24:50.120]  was in the capital
[02:24:50.120 --> 02:24:52.120]  in the fanciest hotel in the bar
[02:24:52.120 --> 02:24:54.120]  and there were Goldman Sachs people
[02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:56.120]  bragging about what they were planning to do there
[02:24:56.120 --> 02:24:58.120]  and so he went out on TV about it
[02:24:58.120 --> 02:25:00.120]  and of course then later it happened
[02:25:00.120 --> 02:25:02.120]  but let's talk about this whistleblower himself
[02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:04.120]  I mean from your own research you can confirm
[02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:06.120]  but now you've gotten the emails
[02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:08.120]  and I remember for 10 years
[02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:10.120]  different whistleblowers went to
[02:25:10.120 --> 02:25:13.120]  the different federal regulatory agencies
[02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:15.120]  with dossiers showing exactly how
[02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:17.120]  Madoff was stealing
[02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:19.120]  50 to 100 depending on how you look at it
[02:25:19.120 --> 02:25:21.120]  billion dollars
[02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:23.120]  and they would never do anything about that
[02:25:23.120 --> 02:25:25.120]  so please continue
[02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:27.120]  we compare ourselves to Harry Markopoulos
[02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:29.120]  who went to the FCC for 10 years and said look at this
[02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:31.120]  it's a fraud
[02:25:31.120 --> 02:25:33.120]  we've been going to the CFTC for 10 years saying
[02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:35.120]  look at this, it's a fraud
[02:25:35.120 --> 02:25:37.120]  I met with the speaker of the house, Dennis Haster
[02:25:37.120 --> 02:25:39.120]  the Senate Banking Committee
[02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:41.120]  the Economic Committee, we've been to
[02:25:41.120 --> 02:25:43.120]  President Bush's good friends
[02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:45.120]  here in Texas Boyhood Friends
[02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:47.120]  they've got a fax back from Lawrence Lindsay
[02:25:47.120 --> 02:25:49.120]  his economic advisor time
[02:25:49.120 --> 02:25:51.120]  so we've really gone after this thing
[02:25:51.120 --> 02:25:53.120]  and we really got a break here with this Andrew McGuire
[02:25:53.120 --> 02:25:56.120]  because ironically he's a former Goldman Sachs trader
[02:25:56.120 --> 02:25:58.120]  and it's another bar story
[02:25:58.120 --> 02:26:00.120]  what happened was he was out with these J.P. Morgan guys
[02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:02.120]  he's known them for years
[02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:04.120]  and they were laughing at him and they probably had a little too much to drink
[02:26:04.120 --> 02:26:06.120]  he was saying what they were doing
[02:26:06.120 --> 02:26:08.120]  in the gold market
[02:26:08.120 --> 02:26:10.120]  and he said
[02:26:10.120 --> 02:26:12.120]  this is just wrong
[02:26:12.120 --> 02:26:14.120]  and so that's when
[02:26:14.120 --> 02:26:16.120]  we got his information
[02:26:16.120 --> 02:26:18.120]  he's been a member of my website
[02:26:18.120 --> 02:26:20.120]  Lometropolecafe.com
[02:26:20.120 --> 02:26:22.120]  for 3 or 4 years
[02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:24.120]  I met him in London
[02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:26.120]  he's a stand up guy, he's a smart guy
[02:26:26.120 --> 02:26:28.120]  he deals with agent banks
[02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:30.120]  in the bullion market
[02:26:30.120 --> 02:26:32.120]  and he just came forth
[02:26:32.120 --> 02:26:34.120]  and just dropped his bombshell
[02:26:34.120 --> 02:26:36.120]  on the CFTC
[02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:38.120]  they're going to have a tough time
[02:26:38.120 --> 02:26:40.120]  letting this one go
[02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:42.120]  because what do you explain to the public
[02:26:42.120 --> 02:26:44.120]  especially if these gold and silver markets blow up
[02:26:44.120 --> 02:26:46.120]  like we think is going to occur
[02:26:46.120 --> 02:26:48.120]  now let's be specific
[02:26:48.120 --> 02:26:50.120]  and I've talked to a lot of high power people
[02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:52.120]  from Wall Street that also live here in Austin
[02:26:52.120 --> 02:26:54.120]  part of the year
[02:26:54.120 --> 02:26:56.120]  and we've discussed this case
[02:26:56.120 --> 02:26:58.120]  and they say absolutely
[02:26:58.120 --> 02:27:00.120]  when you go to these elite bars
[02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:02.120]  and you're an elite trader with one of the big firms
[02:27:02.120 --> 02:27:04.120]  and you're in a different division
[02:27:04.120 --> 02:27:06.120]  all they talk about is how we're scum
[02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:08.120]  fools, how they're going to take over
[02:27:08.120 --> 02:27:10.120]  everything and they just
[02:27:10.120 --> 02:27:12.120]  constantly laugh and joke
[02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:14.120]  because they know the
[02:27:14.120 --> 02:27:16.120]  government is run by their alumni
[02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:18.120]  I mean look at Goldman Sachs
[02:27:18.120 --> 02:27:20.120]  they've got every major regulatory position filled
[02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:22.120]  well I have the treasure of Goldman Sachs
[02:27:22.120 --> 02:27:24.120]  so we call it government Sachs
[02:27:24.120 --> 02:27:26.120]  because half the people at the
[02:27:26.120 --> 02:27:28.120]  Treasury come from Goldman Sachs
[02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:30.120]  just like JP Morgan at the Fed's Bank
[02:27:30.120 --> 02:27:32.120]  but that's the issue
[02:27:32.120 --> 02:27:34.120]  with the elite bars
[02:27:34.120 --> 02:27:36.120]  these elite bars which better wear a $2,000 suit
[02:27:36.120 --> 02:27:38.120]  and start just recording these guys
[02:27:38.120 --> 02:27:40.120]  but again he sent them emails
[02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:42.120]  Andrew sent emails
[02:27:42.120 --> 02:27:44.120]  to the CFTC
[02:27:44.120 --> 02:27:46.120]  to their legal counsel saying
[02:27:46.120 --> 02:27:48.120]  here's what's going to happen and when
[02:27:48.120 --> 02:27:50.120]  and he said watching it in certain days
[02:27:50.120 --> 02:27:52.120]  they seem to attack around job reports
[02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:54.120]  certain government auctions
[02:27:54.120 --> 02:27:56.120]  and the auction expires and so on
[02:27:56.120 --> 02:27:58.120]  and he said this is exactly what they're going to do
[02:27:58.120 --> 02:28:00.120]  and the last time I think one point he mentioned
[02:28:00.120 --> 02:28:02.120]  I think the price went down like 30 or 40
[02:28:02.120 --> 02:28:04.120]  bucks
[02:28:04.120 --> 02:28:06.120]  that's a lot so
[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:08.120]  this is just a bomb shell
[02:28:08.120 --> 02:28:10.120]  that's slowly working its way around
[02:28:10.120 --> 02:28:12.120]  and
[02:28:12.120 --> 02:28:14.120]  and festering and
[02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:16.120]  finally it's given us the attention that
[02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:18.120]  we've earned after
[02:28:18.120 --> 02:28:20.120]  working on this stuff for over a decade
[02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:22.120]  and by the way we're not
[02:28:22.120 --> 02:28:24.120]  just idle and just talk about it we're suing the Fed
[02:28:24.120 --> 02:28:26.120]  it was very difficult today
[02:28:26.120 --> 02:28:28.120]  for me to listen to President Obama
[02:28:28.120 --> 02:28:30.120]  talk about transparency
[02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:32.120]  derivatives, financial market reform
[02:28:32.120 --> 02:28:34.120]  when he's allowing what's occurring
[02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:36.120]  in the gold and silver markets
[02:28:36.120 --> 02:28:38.120]  so what we did
[02:28:38.120 --> 02:28:40.120]  President Obama wants more transparency
[02:28:40.120 --> 02:28:42.120]  we went to the Freedom of Information Act
[02:28:42.120 --> 02:28:44.120]  and got asked them to tell us
[02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:46.120]  what the US was doing in the gold swap area
[02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:48.120]  just a gold transaction
[02:28:48.120 --> 02:28:50.120]  kind of thing and they said
[02:28:50.120 --> 02:28:52.120]  got back to us and said no they're exempt
[02:28:52.120 --> 02:28:54.120]  from telling us that they're secrets
[02:28:54.120 --> 02:28:56.120]  and so we're suing him in federal court
[02:28:56.120 --> 02:28:58.120]  to try to get to the truth
[02:28:58.120 --> 02:29:00.120]  it's the American people's gold not theirs
[02:29:00.120 --> 02:29:02.120]  well I mean come on
[02:29:02.120 --> 02:29:04.120]  Obama passed the stimulus package
[02:29:04.120 --> 02:29:06.120]  that gave banks more power
[02:29:06.120 --> 02:29:08.120]  and it retroactively let all the banks
[02:29:08.120 --> 02:29:10.120]  keep all their bonuses and run all their scams
[02:29:10.120 --> 02:29:12.120]  and it's not just me saying this
[02:29:12.120 --> 02:29:14.120]  I mean I'm reading what the Texas Banking Association's saying
[02:29:14.120 --> 02:29:16.120]  and their analysis is identical to mine
[02:29:16.120 --> 02:29:18.120]  that this new
[02:29:18.120 --> 02:29:20.120]  regulatory framework of the G20
[02:29:20.120 --> 02:29:22.120]  and the national level
[02:29:22.120 --> 02:29:24.120]  gives the select banks JPMorgan Chase
[02:29:24.120 --> 02:29:26.120]  and a handful of others
[02:29:26.120 --> 02:29:28.120]  the power to take over all the healthy regional
[02:29:28.120 --> 02:29:30.120]  banks that aren't in derivatives
[02:29:30.120 --> 02:29:32.120]  and sets up a value added tax
[02:29:32.120 --> 02:29:34.120]  on all financial transactions
[02:29:34.120 --> 02:29:36.120]  that's paid to the coffers
[02:29:36.120 --> 02:29:38.120]  of the IMF and World Bank
[02:29:38.120 --> 02:29:40.120]  and then fenced directly in
[02:29:40.120 --> 02:29:42.120]  to the private central banks
[02:29:42.120 --> 02:29:44.120]  I mean this is so incredible
[02:29:44.120 --> 02:29:46.120]  and it's being billed as getting the rich bankers
[02:29:46.120 --> 02:29:48.120]  stay there let's talk about how they manipulate
[02:29:48.120 --> 02:29:50.120]  gold on the other side and how we stop them
[02:29:50.120 --> 02:29:52.120]  we're on the march
[02:29:52.120 --> 02:29:54.120]  the empire's on the run
[02:29:54.120 --> 02:29:56.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN
[02:29:56.120 --> 02:29:58.120]  radio network
[02:30:00.120 --> 02:30:02.120]  with the implementation
[02:30:02.120 --> 02:30:04.120]  of Codex Alimentarius
[02:30:04.120 --> 02:30:06.120]  it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid
[02:30:06.120 --> 02:30:08.120]  losing our freedom of choice where personal health
[02:30:08.120 --> 02:30:10.120]  preferences are concerned
[02:30:10.120 --> 02:30:12.120]  as of January 1st 2010
[02:30:12.120 --> 02:30:14.120]  Codex Alimentarius was implemented
[02:30:14.120 --> 02:30:16.120]  within the European Union resulting
[02:30:16.120 --> 02:30:18.120]  in the restricted sale of many natural
[02:30:18.120 --> 02:30:20.120]  supplements including colloidal silver
[02:30:20.120 --> 02:30:22.120]  we must take immediate steps
[02:30:22.120 --> 02:30:24.120]  to assure a continuing supply of colloidal
[02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:26.120]  silver for ourselves and our families
[02:30:26.120 --> 02:30:28.120]  act now to acquire the means
[02:30:28.120 --> 02:30:30.120]  of producing this beneficial supplement
[02:30:30.120 --> 02:30:32.120]  in the privacy of your own home
[02:30:32.120 --> 02:30:34.120]  colloidal silver is a powerful antipathogenic
[02:30:34.120 --> 02:30:36.120]  used for more than 200 years
[02:30:36.120 --> 02:30:38.120]  as a natural alternative to costly drugs
[02:30:38.120 --> 02:30:40.120]  and their dangerous unpredictable side effects
[02:30:40.120 --> 02:30:42.120]  go to www.silverlungs.com
[02:30:44.120 --> 02:30:46.120]  for more information on how to secure
[02:30:46.120 --> 02:30:48.120]  your freedom of choice by producing
[02:30:48.120 --> 02:30:50.120]  your own colloidal silver right from home
[02:30:50.120 --> 02:30:52.120]  that's www.silverlungs.com
[02:31:00.120 --> 02:31:02.120]  Hi this is Alex Jones did you know
[02:31:02.120 --> 02:31:04.120]  that the global elite are now storing
[02:31:04.120 --> 02:31:06.120]  non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults
[02:31:06.120 --> 02:31:08.120]  near the Arctic Circle did you know
[02:31:08.120 --> 02:31:10.120]  that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds
[02:31:10.120 --> 02:31:12.120]  could become more valuable than silver or gold
[02:31:12.120 --> 02:31:14.120]  it's true seeds about performing even gold
[02:31:14.120 --> 02:31:16.120]  and silver before in this country and it's possible
[02:31:16.120 --> 02:31:18.120]  that could even happen again
[02:31:18.120 --> 02:31:20.120]  so our friends at Solutions from Science
[02:31:20.120 --> 02:31:22.120]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[02:31:22.120 --> 02:31:24.120]  they call it a survival seed bank
[02:31:24.120 --> 02:31:26.120]  and it can produce
[02:31:26.120 --> 02:31:28.120]  an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[02:31:28.120 --> 02:31:30.120]  for you and your family
[02:31:30.120 --> 02:31:32.120]  and here's the best part these seeds have not
[02:31:32.120 --> 02:31:34.120]  been genetically modified in any way
[02:31:34.120 --> 02:31:36.120]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant
[02:31:36.120 --> 02:31:38.120]  a full acre crisis garden
[02:31:38.120 --> 02:31:40.120]  so visit them today at www.survivalseedbank.com

[02:31:48.120 --> 02:31:50.120]  remember
[02:31:50.120 --> 02:31:52.120]  in a real crisis
[02:31:52.120 --> 02:31:54.120]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate
[02:31:54.120 --> 02:31:56.120]  barter item this is Alex Jones

[02:32:02.120 --> 02:32:04.120]  is on the road
[02:32:04.120 --> 02:32:06.120]  but if the unfortunate happens
[02:32:06.120 --> 02:32:08.120]  you'll be glad you were wearing
[02:32:08.120 --> 02:32:10.120]  diamond gussets
[02:32:10.120 --> 02:32:12.120]  there's a place down in Tennessee
[02:32:12.120 --> 02:32:14.120]  there's a place down in Tennessee
[02:32:16.120 --> 02:32:18.120]  where they make blue diamond gusset
[02:32:18.120 --> 02:32:20.120]  jeans
[02:32:20.120 --> 02:32:22.120]  they so pride in every stitch

[02:32:32.120 --> 02:32:34.120]  where you need it most
[02:32:34.120 --> 02:32:36.120]  blue diamond gussets
[02:32:36.120 --> 02:32:38.120]  got it
[02:32:38.120 --> 02:32:40.120]  others don't
[02:32:40.120 --> 02:32:42.120]  diamond gusset jeans
[02:32:42.120 --> 02:32:44.120]  made in the USA with
[02:32:44.120 --> 02:32:46.120]  unparalleled quality
[02:32:46.120 --> 02:32:48.120]  our Defender motorcycle jeans combine

[02:32:56.120 --> 02:32:58.120]  got it
[02:32:58.120 --> 02:33:00.120]  others don't
[02:33:04.120 --> 02:33:06.120]  they railed against the crown
[02:33:06.120 --> 02:33:08.120]  another ragtag band
[02:33:08.120 --> 02:33:10.120]  they railed against the crown
[02:33:12.120 --> 02:33:14.120]  another ragtag band
[02:33:18.120 --> 02:33:20.120]  Bill Murphy, the chairman and director
[02:33:20.120 --> 02:33:22.120]  of GATA, Gold Antitrust Action Committee
[02:33:22.120 --> 02:33:24.120]  is our guest
[02:33:24.120 --> 02:33:26.120]  let's get back into
[02:33:26.120 --> 02:33:28.120]  more of what the whistleblower said
[02:33:28.120 --> 02:33:30.120]  how we know the big banks and governments
[02:33:30.120 --> 02:33:32.120]  fix the price of gold and silver
[02:33:32.120 --> 02:33:34.120]  the way they make profits out of this
[02:33:34.120 --> 02:33:36.120]  how this is detrimental
[02:33:36.120 --> 02:33:38.120]  to the public
[02:33:38.120 --> 02:33:40.120]  and how we support GATA
[02:33:40.120 --> 02:33:42.120]  and what you're doing
[02:33:42.120 --> 02:33:44.120]  because clearly there's a fuse going to this keg
[02:33:44.120 --> 02:33:46.120]  of TNT
[02:33:46.120 --> 02:33:48.120]  that could blow this
[02:33:48.120 --> 02:33:50.120]  Ponzi scheme, this fraud
[02:33:50.120 --> 02:33:52.120]  sky high
[02:33:52.120 --> 02:33:54.120]  and really reveal
[02:33:54.120 --> 02:33:56.120]  all these crimes that have been committed
[02:33:56.120 --> 02:33:58.120]  this is clearly illegal
[02:33:58.120 --> 02:34:00.120]  but we want to make sure that fuse that's now burning
[02:34:00.120 --> 02:34:02.120]  burns faster, hotter
[02:34:02.120 --> 02:34:04.120]  and doesn't
[02:34:04.120 --> 02:34:06.120]  if you light a firecracker, it doesn't burn all the way
[02:34:06.120 --> 02:34:08.120]  it stops, it sputters
[02:34:08.120 --> 02:34:10.120]  so how do we ensure
[02:34:10.120 --> 02:34:12.120]  this is a touchdown for the good guys
[02:34:12.120 --> 02:34:14.120]  well, shows like this are a big help Alex
[02:34:14.120 --> 02:34:16.120]  and we're trying to be
[02:34:16.120 --> 02:34:18.120]  as visible as possible
[02:34:18.120 --> 02:34:20.120]  because once people look at it
[02:34:20.120 --> 02:34:22.120]  and really study the evidence, they go good grief
[02:34:22.120 --> 02:34:24.120]  and if I might say
[02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:26.120]  on some of the subjects you're talking about
[02:34:26.120 --> 02:34:28.120]  it's not just gold
[02:34:28.120 --> 02:34:30.120]  there's a lot of people that didn't talk about
[02:34:30.120 --> 02:34:32.120]  the punge protection team
[02:34:32.120 --> 02:34:34.120]  in financial markets
[02:34:34.120 --> 02:34:36.120]  which president, I think treasurer
[02:34:36.120 --> 02:34:38.120]  head of the SEC
[02:34:38.120 --> 02:34:40.120]  and head of the CFTC
[02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:42.120]  work to stabilize the markets
[02:34:42.120 --> 02:34:44.120]  and there's something I've never heard one other person mention
[02:34:44.120 --> 02:34:46.120]  called the counter party risk management group
[02:34:46.120 --> 02:34:48.120]  and if any of your people are interested
[02:34:48.120 --> 02:34:50.120]  they can do a Google counter party risk management group
[02:34:50.120 --> 02:34:52.120]  and you'll see
[02:34:52.120 --> 02:34:54.120]  excuse me, it's a group
[02:34:54.120 --> 02:34:56.120]  of the hedge funds and some of the big wall street firms
[02:34:56.120 --> 02:34:58.120]  and you'll see their main
[02:34:58.120 --> 02:35:00.120]  mantra is head up by a lot of the golden sacks people
[02:35:00.120 --> 02:35:02.120]  is to create close stability
[02:35:02.120 --> 02:35:04.120]  in the market
[02:35:04.120 --> 02:35:06.120]  and they're behind the scenes working on the stock market
[02:35:06.120 --> 02:35:08.120]  that's one reason we believe
[02:35:08.120 --> 02:35:10.120]  you've had this steady up go
[02:35:10.120 --> 02:35:12.120]  oh jeez for it seems like forever
[02:35:12.120 --> 02:35:14.120]  it just never seems to correct
[02:35:14.120 --> 02:35:16.120]  it just goes up a little bit every day and so on
[02:35:16.120 --> 02:35:18.120]  so it's pervasive in our markets
[02:35:18.120 --> 02:35:20.120]  in addition to gold and silver
[02:35:20.120 --> 02:35:22.120]  by the way they're just tiny little
[02:35:22.120 --> 02:35:24.120]  markets for these people
[02:35:24.120 --> 02:35:26.120]  even if they lost money on this it's like
[02:35:26.120 --> 02:35:28.120]  it would be like a lost leader for the government
[02:35:28.120 --> 02:35:30.120]  for the trillions now
[02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:32.120]  when we talk in those numbers these days
[02:35:32.120 --> 02:35:34.120]  what the government's doing
[02:35:34.120 --> 02:35:36.120]  the little gold market is just this little barometer
[02:35:36.120 --> 02:35:38.120]  that they want to have to use and that's why
[02:35:38.120 --> 02:35:40.120]  they work it over in the physical market
[02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:42.120]  and the derivatives and tack at certain times
[02:35:42.120 --> 02:35:44.120]  and flush out the speculators
[02:35:44.120 --> 02:35:46.120]  get people to moralize it then it goes right back up again
[02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:48.120]  like you said earlier like a beach ball
[02:35:48.120 --> 02:35:50.120]  it's emerge they can't keep it down
[02:35:50.120 --> 02:35:52.120]  and we'll be we have a long way to go here
[02:35:52.120 --> 02:35:54.120]  and we're working very hard at it
[02:35:54.120 --> 02:35:56.120]  I talk about the gold market
[02:35:56.120 --> 02:35:58.120]  every day at LaMetropoleCafe.com
[02:35:58.120 --> 02:36:00.120]  and people can sign up for a
[02:36:00.120 --> 02:36:02.120]  two-week free trial then if they like it it's a subscription
[02:36:02.120 --> 02:36:04.120]  but the GATA site
[02:36:04.120 --> 02:36:06.120]  they do it at www.gata.org
[02:36:06.120 --> 02:36:08.120]  it's a free site
[02:36:08.120 --> 02:36:10.120]  Chris Powell puts out emails all the time
[02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:12.120]  he just does a fantastic job
[02:36:12.120 --> 02:36:14.120]  alerting people what's going on
[02:36:14.120 --> 02:36:16.120]  so they can keep abreast of the situation
[02:36:16.120 --> 02:36:18.120]  and you know we know
[02:36:18.120 --> 02:36:20.120]  maybe we're going to get a break with the district court
[02:36:20.120 --> 02:36:22.120]  in our lawsuit against it
[02:36:22.120 --> 02:36:24.120]  to try to get information from the Fed
[02:36:24.120 --> 02:36:26.120]  about the Fed's petrified of the gold issue
[02:36:26.120 --> 02:36:28.120]  which is why they're fighting
[02:36:28.120 --> 02:36:30.120]  Ron Paul and his bill to audit the Fed
[02:36:30.120 --> 02:36:32.120]  because this isn't just a little bitty market
[02:36:32.120 --> 02:36:34.120]  I mean in the aggregate it is
[02:36:34.120 --> 02:36:36.120]  but it could become the biggest market
[02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:39.120]  and it would unseat all of their fraudulent paper
[02:36:39.120 --> 02:36:42.120]  and now we've got Bloomberg and others reporting
[02:36:42.120 --> 02:36:44.120]  federal regulators are going in
[02:36:44.120 --> 02:36:46.120]  telling public and private pension funds
[02:36:46.120 --> 02:36:48.120]  threatening them to invest
[02:36:48.120 --> 02:36:50.120]  people's savings in quote
[02:36:50.120 --> 02:36:52.120]  failed banks
[02:36:52.120 --> 02:36:55.120]  and so this is all coming to a head right now
[02:36:55.120 --> 02:36:58.120]  and this is so important
[02:36:58.120 --> 02:37:00.120]  to expose this situation
[02:37:00.120 --> 02:37:02.120]  I didn't mean by the way
[02:37:02.120 --> 02:37:04.120]  to diminish the gold and silver issue
[02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:06.120]  or the size of it just in terms of like
[02:37:06.120 --> 02:37:08.120]  if you talk about market caps
[02:37:08.120 --> 02:37:10.120]  or anything like this it's a tiny market
[02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:12.120]  but it's actually the most important market
[02:37:12.120 --> 02:37:14.120]  for just what you're talking about
[02:37:14.120 --> 02:37:16.120]  when that goes it would be headlines all over the world
[02:37:16.120 --> 02:37:18.120]  because gold and silver
[02:37:18.120 --> 02:37:20.120]  are not just American markets
[02:37:20.120 --> 02:37:23.120]  and it's going to be a major major story
[02:37:23.120 --> 02:37:26.120]  and it unseeds all of the major global currencies
[02:37:26.120 --> 02:37:28.120]  that are being debased
[02:37:28.120 --> 02:37:30.120]  in a concerted effort on record
[02:37:30.120 --> 02:37:32.120]  by the G20 so that people don't recognize
[02:37:32.120 --> 02:37:34.120]  it's kind of like in the US you know
[02:37:34.120 --> 02:37:36.120]  they've got a debased currency in Mexico
[02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:38.120]  because it's 3 to 1, 4 to 1
[02:37:38.120 --> 02:37:40.120]  but instead now with the Euro
[02:37:40.120 --> 02:37:42.120]  and all the other major currencies
[02:37:42.120 --> 02:37:44.120]  they're devaluing them basically simultaneously
[02:37:44.120 --> 02:37:46.120]  yes that's right right right to the point
[02:37:46.120 --> 02:37:48.120]  matter of fact I mentioned Russia earlier
[02:37:48.120 --> 02:37:50.120]  like the NBC of Russia
[02:37:50.120 --> 02:37:52.120]  Studio One came here about two weeks ago
[02:37:52.120 --> 02:37:54.120]  with a camera person
[02:37:54.120 --> 02:37:56.120]  and a reporter they're doing a big story on this
[02:37:56.120 --> 02:37:58.120]  and as I said it's so ironic
[02:37:58.120 --> 02:38:00.120]  that God is very well known in Russia
[02:38:00.120 --> 02:38:02.120]  and not known at all in the United States
[02:38:02.120 --> 02:38:04.120]  well Russia if you actually
[02:38:04.120 --> 02:38:06.120]  Anthony Sutton
[02:38:06.120 --> 02:38:08.120]  and others got the US government documents on this
[02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:10.120]  and of course he worked for the senate
[02:38:10.120 --> 02:38:12.120]  that the large
[02:38:12.120 --> 02:38:14.120]  central banks here
[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:16.120]  and in England funded the communists
[02:38:16.120 --> 02:38:18.120]  and when
[02:38:18.120 --> 02:38:20.120]  the Russians in the late 90's
[02:38:20.120 --> 02:38:22.120]  kicked out the oligarchs
[02:38:22.120 --> 02:38:24.120]  it turned out they were all fronts
[02:38:24.120 --> 02:38:26.120]  for western brokerage houses and banks
[02:38:26.120 --> 02:38:28.120]  and Russia's got its own problems
[02:38:28.120 --> 02:38:30.120]  but Russia is now in many cases
[02:38:30.120 --> 02:38:32.120]  more free market than we are
[02:38:32.120 --> 02:38:34.120]  they pay people to have children though
[02:38:34.120 --> 02:38:36.120]  our government wants a one-child policy
[02:38:36.120 --> 02:38:38.120]  they've arrested the oligarchs
[02:38:38.120 --> 02:38:40.120]  they're talking about world government
[02:38:40.120 --> 02:38:42.120]  they're talking about the new world order
[02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:44.120]  and
[02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:46.120]  they're actually subjects
[02:38:46.120 --> 02:38:48.120]  because for the first time in close to 100 years
[02:38:48.120 --> 02:38:50.120]  there appears to be a real
[02:38:50.120 --> 02:38:52.120]  fissure
[02:38:52.120 --> 02:38:54.120]  between Russia
[02:38:54.120 --> 02:38:56.120]  and the Anglo-American banking establishment
[02:38:56.120 --> 02:38:58.120]  well I know that
[02:38:58.120 --> 02:39:00.120]  the Bank of England has been very responsible
[02:39:00.120 --> 02:39:02.120]  for the gold price suppression scheme
[02:39:02.120 --> 02:39:04.120]  and right now it's a big deal
[02:39:04.120 --> 02:39:06.120]  the gold subject because Gordon Brown's running for re-election
[02:39:06.120 --> 02:39:08.120]  and
[02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:10.120]  he sold half their gold right at the bottom of the market
[02:39:10.120 --> 02:39:12.120]  and I've had this all
[02:39:12.120 --> 02:39:14.120]  laid out with his connection with Goldman Sachs
[02:39:14.120 --> 02:39:16.120]  the billion banks were in trouble back then
[02:39:16.120 --> 02:39:18.120]  they needed supply so
[02:39:18.120 --> 02:39:20.120]  he sold England's gold at the bottom
[02:39:20.120 --> 02:39:22.120]  it's costing billions and billions of dollars
[02:39:22.120 --> 02:39:24.120]  and we're trying to make some hay with this one
[02:39:24.120 --> 02:39:26.120]  before the election over there in England
[02:39:26.120 --> 02:39:28.120]  absolutely that's the type of thing they do
[02:39:28.120 --> 02:39:30.120]  and of course you go back to 1933
[02:39:30.120 --> 02:39:32.120]  when they made physical holding of gold
[02:39:32.120 --> 02:39:34.120]  illegal
[02:39:34.120 --> 02:39:36.120]  and then they jacked with the price a few years ago
[02:39:36.120 --> 02:39:38.120]  they doubled it after all our gold
[02:39:38.120 --> 02:39:40.120]  had basically been shipped to Europe
[02:39:40.120 --> 02:39:42.120]  and it comes
[02:39:42.120 --> 02:39:44.120]  other points that are important
[02:39:44.120 --> 02:39:46.120]  for people to be made aware of
[02:39:46.120 --> 02:39:48.120]  looking into your crystal ball
[02:39:48.120 --> 02:39:50.120]  and talking to people in the markets
[02:39:50.120 --> 02:39:52.120]  I don't want you to make a prediction
[02:39:52.120 --> 02:39:54.120]  but if you had to deadwreck and how do you see this unfolding
[02:39:54.120 --> 02:39:56.120]  probably like every other scandal
[02:39:56.120 --> 02:39:58.120]  whether it's
[02:39:58.120 --> 02:40:00.120]  a Revco or Brokerich house
[02:40:00.120 --> 02:40:02.120]  or Enron or Madoff
[02:40:02.120 --> 02:40:04.120]  it blows up
[02:40:04.120 --> 02:40:06.120]  and then all of a sudden everyone's running around
[02:40:06.120 --> 02:40:08.120]  saying how could this have happened
[02:40:08.120 --> 02:40:10.120]  people delving into the facts
[02:40:10.120 --> 02:40:12.120]  of the story and that's how it's exposed
[02:40:12.120 --> 02:40:14.120]  unfortunately and it's likely
[02:40:14.120 --> 02:40:16.120]  the way it's going to happen here
[02:40:16.120 --> 02:40:18.120]  where silver and gold just absolutely explodes
[02:40:18.120 --> 02:40:20.120]  there's some defaults in the marketplace
[02:40:20.120 --> 02:40:22.120]  people can't deliver
[02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:24.120]  on their promises to deliver
[02:40:24.120 --> 02:40:26.120]  the physical bullying of people
[02:40:26.120 --> 02:40:28.120]  and it'll be a huge
[02:40:28.120 --> 02:40:30.120]  huge commotion that's how I think it's going to play out
[02:40:32.120 --> 02:40:34.120]  what's the time frame next two three years
[02:40:34.120 --> 02:40:36.120]  yeah you know Jesus
[02:40:36.120 --> 02:40:38.120]  it's so tough about the time frame
[02:40:38.120 --> 02:40:40.120]  I mean it could happen in two weeks
[02:40:40.120 --> 02:40:42.120]  or two years it's just one of these things
[02:40:42.120 --> 02:40:44.120]  had we not had the financial scandal
[02:40:44.120 --> 02:40:46.120]  Madoff would still be trucking right along
[02:40:46.120 --> 02:40:48.120]  and a lot of this is up to the listeners
[02:40:48.120 --> 02:40:50.120]  of this show we have several million listeners
[02:40:50.120 --> 02:40:52.120]  if they get the
[02:40:52.120 --> 02:40:54.120]  censored video of you and others
[02:40:54.120 --> 02:40:56.120]  out to people if they get the censored documents
[02:40:56.120 --> 02:40:58.120]  out if they put pressure
[02:40:58.120 --> 02:41:00.120]  I mean that's why Obama politically
[02:41:00.120 --> 02:41:02.120]  now is going after with the SEC
[02:41:02.120 --> 02:41:04.120]  Goldman with you know
[02:41:04.120 --> 02:41:06.120]  $30 fine slap on the wrist
[02:41:06.120 --> 02:41:08.120]  an investigation maybe some underling
[02:41:08.120 --> 02:41:10.120]  will go on probation
[02:41:10.120 --> 02:41:12.120]  they're having to at least do that
[02:41:12.120 --> 02:41:14.120]  because it's political suicide if they don't
[02:41:14.120 --> 02:41:16.120]  we need to force this out all the way into the open
[02:41:16.120 --> 02:41:18.120]  because even though this is a whitewash investigation
[02:41:18.120 --> 02:41:20.120]  it's now opening up more lawsuits
[02:41:20.120 --> 02:41:22.120]  it's now legitimizing those of us
[02:41:22.120 --> 02:41:24.120]  that have exposed the corruption
[02:41:24.120 --> 02:41:26.120]  of the main pilots of this
[02:41:26.120 --> 02:41:28.120]  banking cartel Goldman Sachs
[02:41:28.120 --> 02:41:30.120]  that's right the irony is
[02:41:30.120 --> 02:41:32.120]  is that is right now the two haunches
[02:41:32.120 --> 02:41:34.120]  just BC
[02:41:34.120 --> 02:41:36.120]  and JP Morgan Chase with Goldman Sachs
[02:41:36.120 --> 02:41:38.120]  was the ringleader in this thing for I don't know
[02:41:38.120 --> 02:41:40.120]  six seven eight nine years
[02:41:40.120 --> 02:41:42.120]  they've disappeared of late maybe because they're concentrating
[02:41:42.120 --> 02:41:44.120]  on the stock market I don't know but
[02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:46.120]  they everywhere we
[02:41:46.120 --> 02:41:48.120]  looked for a period of eight or nine years Goldman Sachs
[02:41:48.120 --> 02:41:50.120]  was everywhere on this particular issue
[02:41:50.120 --> 02:41:52.120]  they're now
[02:41:52.120 --> 02:41:54.120]  top of the heap
[02:41:54.120 --> 02:41:56.120]  their underlings are now carrying
[02:41:56.120 --> 02:41:58.120]  on this operation
[02:41:58.120 --> 02:42:00.120]  but again
[02:42:00.120 --> 02:42:02.120]  the important point you made is 90 plus percent
[02:42:02.120 --> 02:42:04.120]  I think you have the number of 93 percent
[02:42:04.120 --> 02:42:06.120]  and I'm looking at news today
[02:42:06.120 --> 02:42:08.120]  gold weaker as grease
[02:42:08.120 --> 02:42:10.120]  debt issue back on front
[02:42:10.120 --> 02:42:12.120]  burner well that's the same reason this is
[02:42:12.120 --> 02:42:14.120]  the commentary is ludicrous in this industry
[02:42:14.120 --> 02:42:16.120]  last week
[02:42:16.120 --> 02:42:18.120]  it goes up because of the
[02:42:18.120 --> 02:42:20.120]  Greek problems then it's down
[02:42:20.120 --> 02:42:22.120]  if these people hit the market
[02:42:22.120 --> 02:42:24.120]  then the reporters just talk about anything
[02:42:24.120 --> 02:42:26.120]  you can have it
[02:42:26.120 --> 02:42:28.120]  go to be up to 50 bucks
[02:42:28.120 --> 02:42:30.120]  on the Greek debt problems
[02:42:30.120 --> 02:42:32.120]  well that's what I was about to say
[02:42:32.120 --> 02:42:34.120]  just as a layman here
[02:42:34.120 --> 02:42:36.120]  but I've done a lot of research
[02:42:36.120 --> 02:42:38.120]  having major currency crises
[02:42:38.120 --> 02:42:40.120]  that even in the words of Merkel and the words
[02:42:40.120 --> 02:42:42.120]  of Soros could bring down the euro
[02:42:42.120 --> 02:42:44.120]  this could bring down the euro
[02:42:44.120 --> 02:42:46.120]  and
[02:42:46.120 --> 02:42:48.120]  by every barometer that should shoot gold
[02:42:48.120 --> 02:42:50.120]  straight up and there's all these headlines
[02:42:50.120 --> 02:42:52.120]  about gold down five dollars
[02:42:52.120 --> 02:42:54.120]  or four and a half dollars
[02:42:54.120 --> 02:42:56.120]  let me give you the exact number folks
[02:42:56.120 --> 02:42:58.120]  gold's down four dollars and seventy cents
[02:42:58.120 --> 02:43:00.120]  right now and the media is saying
[02:43:00.120 --> 02:43:02.120]  because currencies are in trouble
[02:43:02.120 --> 02:43:04.120]  currencies are ludicrous
[02:43:04.120 --> 02:43:06.120]  this is what happens over the years
[02:43:06.120 --> 02:43:08.120]  and we've seen this any followers
[02:43:08.120 --> 02:43:10.120]  I know there's a bunch of people listening on your show
[02:43:10.120 --> 02:43:12.120]  the worse the situation or the better
[02:43:12.120 --> 02:43:14.120]  it is for gold or the more reasons for people
[02:43:14.120 --> 02:43:16.120]  to go to gold that's when
[02:43:16.120 --> 02:43:18.120]  the gold cartel attacks the price
[02:43:18.120 --> 02:43:20.120]  because they want to diffuse the barometer
[02:43:20.120 --> 02:43:22.120]  tone down the thermometer
[02:43:22.120 --> 02:43:24.120]  they do it all the time
[02:43:24.120 --> 02:43:26.120]  it's just again it's ridiculous
[02:43:26.120 --> 02:43:28.120]  for people to say gold's going down
[02:43:28.120 --> 02:43:30.120]  because of the crisis
[02:43:30.120 --> 02:43:32.120]  it does
[02:43:32.120 --> 02:43:34.120]  no it is nuts but again
[02:43:34.120 --> 02:43:36.120]  they know people are looking at a month to month
[02:43:36.120 --> 02:43:38.120]  or week to week graph you look at the year graph
[02:43:38.120 --> 02:43:40.120]  you look at the two year the three year the four year the five
[02:43:40.120 --> 02:43:42.120]  gold's going straight up
[02:43:42.120 --> 02:43:44.120]  and if it continues like this
[02:43:44.120 --> 02:43:46.120]  what another ten years
[02:43:46.120 --> 02:43:48.120]  we'll be looking at two thousand dollars
[02:43:48.120 --> 02:43:50.120]  two thousand dollars probably in another year
[02:43:50.120 --> 02:43:52.120]  not ten years
[02:43:52.120 --> 02:43:54.120]  well absolutely
[02:43:54.120 --> 02:43:56.120]  but I mean even in a suppressed market
[02:43:56.120 --> 02:43:58.120]  even if they continue this scam
[02:43:58.120 --> 02:44:00.120]  you know in ten years
[02:44:00.120 --> 02:44:02.120]  it would double again that's a great investment
[02:44:02.120 --> 02:44:04.120]  of course what's happening is they're running out
[02:44:04.120 --> 02:44:06.120]  of available central bank gold
[02:44:06.120 --> 02:44:08.120]  people think that the gold industry
[02:44:08.120 --> 02:44:10.120]  says there's thirty thousand tons of gold
[02:44:10.120 --> 02:44:12.120]  in central bank vaults
[02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:14.120]  according to the work of our guys which are pretty
[02:44:14.120 --> 02:44:16.120]  pretty top shelf guys there's less than fifteen thousand
[02:44:16.120 --> 02:44:18.120]  tons and European
[02:44:18.120 --> 02:44:20.120]  central banks were selling four to five hundred tons
[02:44:20.120 --> 02:44:22.120]  of gold a year the past three or four months
[02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:24.120]  they haven't sold an ounce
[02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:26.120]  it's drying up it's think of an army that's running
[02:44:26.120 --> 02:44:28.120]  out of ammunition
[02:44:28.120 --> 02:44:30.120]  the bad guys are running out of ammunition all they
[02:44:30.120 --> 02:44:32.120]  can do is have a rear guard action
[02:44:32.120 --> 02:44:34.120]  but it's painful on these dips it's just
[02:44:34.120 --> 02:44:36.120]  you know we should be at twenty three hundred
[02:44:36.120 --> 02:44:38.120]  not not not what we are here
[02:44:38.120 --> 02:44:40.120]  well I just did the math and
[02:44:40.120 --> 02:44:42.120]  I was wrong I was just throwing
[02:44:42.120 --> 02:44:44.120]  a basic number out there
[02:44:44.120 --> 02:44:46.120]  if gold is up almost four fold
[02:44:46.120 --> 02:44:48.120]  in the last ten years
[02:44:48.120 --> 02:44:50.120]  then it's exponential
[02:44:50.120 --> 02:44:52.120]  if it was doubling
[02:44:52.120 --> 02:44:54.120]  you know basically every three four years
[02:44:54.120 --> 02:44:56.120]  then you're right another year and a half
[02:44:56.120 --> 02:44:58.120]  or so it should be well above
[02:44:58.120 --> 02:45:00.120]  two thousand but I was saying
[02:45:00.120 --> 02:45:02.120]  even in their rigged market you know we could
[02:45:02.120 --> 02:45:04.120]  be looking at two thousand three thousand four thousand
[02:45:04.120 --> 02:45:06.120]  the sky's the limit from all of your research
[02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:08.120]  and I know you guys are conservative
[02:45:08.120 --> 02:45:10.120]  where should gold be for real inflation right now
[02:45:10.120 --> 02:45:12.120]  twenty three hundred dollars an ounce
[02:45:12.120 --> 02:45:14.120]  that's what it would be and that's according to
[02:45:14.120 --> 02:45:16.120]  many other people how they kept pace with
[02:45:16.120 --> 02:45:18.120]  inflation and that's just
[02:45:18.120 --> 02:45:20.120]  the published inflation numbers much less
[02:45:20.120 --> 02:45:22.120]  the real inflation numbers so
[02:45:22.120 --> 02:45:24.120]  we have a long way to go
[02:45:24.120 --> 02:45:26.120]  again if I can stress this the bad guys are running
[02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:28.120]  out of ammunition to keep the price down
[02:45:28.120 --> 02:45:30.120]  and you're going to see some kind of
[02:45:30.120 --> 02:45:32.120]  major league fireworks sometime this year
[02:45:34.120 --> 02:45:36.120]  but they do have a lot of
[02:45:36.120 --> 02:45:38.120]  money behind the scenes
[02:45:38.120 --> 02:45:40.120]  but they're running out of physical gold
[02:45:40.120 --> 02:45:42.120]  that's their problem
[02:45:42.120 --> 02:45:44.120]  they've gone through about a thousand
[02:45:44.120 --> 02:45:46.120]  tons per year for fifteen years
[02:45:46.120 --> 02:45:48.120]  so there's a
[02:45:48.120 --> 02:45:50.120]  supply-demand deficit of say
[02:45:50.120 --> 02:45:52.120]  that amount and they've
[02:45:52.120 --> 02:45:54.120]  they've kept the price under control on the
[02:45:54.120 --> 02:45:56.120]  way up by using this physical
[02:45:56.120 --> 02:45:58.120]  gold but they're hitting the world
[02:45:58.120 --> 02:46:00.120]  one of our guys our consultants predicted
[02:46:00.120 --> 02:46:02.120]  this we had a conference in Durban
[02:46:02.120 --> 02:46:04.120]  South Africa May 10th 2001
[02:46:04.120 --> 02:46:06.120]  he said in seven to ten years
[02:46:06.120 --> 02:46:08.120]  they're going to run out of enough gold to keep
[02:46:08.120 --> 02:46:10.120]  the price from really taking off
[02:46:10.120 --> 02:46:14.120]  right in the middle of that zone right now
[02:46:14.120 --> 02:46:16.120]  wow so we could see this in the next month
[02:46:16.120 --> 02:46:18.120]  or the next two years but time is
[02:46:18.120 --> 02:46:20.120]  on our side yeah it's coming
[02:46:20.120 --> 02:46:22.120]  it's inevitable I mean it's just a matter
[02:46:22.120 --> 02:46:24.120]  of how much again how much ammunition
[02:46:24.120 --> 02:46:26.120]  they can come up with at a given time
[02:46:26.120 --> 02:46:28.120]  to meet the growing physical market
[02:46:28.120 --> 02:46:30.120]  demand so it's very exciting
[02:46:30.120 --> 02:46:32.120]  very frustrating on a day-to-day basis
[02:46:32.120 --> 02:46:34.120]  but again we've been up ten years
[02:46:34.120 --> 02:46:36.120]  in a row and as and you said earlier
[02:46:36.120 --> 02:46:38.120]  the acceleration phase is still
[02:46:38.120 --> 02:46:40.120]  in the middle of us
[02:46:40.120 --> 02:46:42.120]  all right in closing we have
[02:46:42.120 --> 02:46:44.120]  the head of Gata Bill Murphy
[02:46:44.120 --> 02:46:46.120]  chairman director of Gata on Weathers
[02:46:46.120 --> 02:46:48.120]  going back to the whistleblower you say
[02:46:48.120 --> 02:46:50.120]  he and his family were hit by a car
[02:46:50.120 --> 02:46:52.120]  remember seeing that in the news that the
[02:46:52.120 --> 02:46:54.120]  person ran and that we haven't
[02:46:54.120 --> 02:46:56.120]  heard what's happened since then
[02:46:56.120 --> 02:46:58.120]  how was Andrew McGuire doing have you
[02:46:58.120 --> 02:47:00.120]  had a chance to talk to him is he getting
[02:47:00.120 --> 02:47:02.120]  he talks to my colleague Adrian Doug
[02:47:02.120 --> 02:47:04.120]  Doug was quite a bit he's getting
[02:47:04.120 --> 02:47:06.120]  there's a bunch of interviews people
[02:47:06.120 --> 02:47:08.120]  I think he's going further with
[02:47:08.120 --> 02:47:10.120]  the legal counsel the CFTC
[02:47:10.120 --> 02:47:12.120]  so there's stuff going on behind the scenes
[02:47:12.120 --> 02:47:14.120]  and it's a process you know these
[02:47:14.120 --> 02:47:16.120]  these investigations do take a long time
[02:47:16.120 --> 02:47:18.120]  well let me do this with you let me put
[02:47:18.120 --> 02:47:20.120]  you on hold and have my producer
[02:47:20.120 --> 02:47:22.120]  talk to you I would like to get you
[02:47:22.120 --> 02:47:24.120]  or your other colleague on with Mr.
[02:47:24.120 --> 02:47:26.120]  McGuire for a full hour
[02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:28.120]  sometime next week I think people need to hear
[02:47:28.120 --> 02:47:30.120]  directly from the whistleblower
[02:47:30.120 --> 02:47:32.120]  who saw these JP Morgan Chase people
[02:47:32.120 --> 02:47:34.120]  rubbing their hands together
[02:47:34.120 --> 02:47:36.120]  and glee do you think that's doable
[02:47:36.120 --> 02:47:38.120]  Mr. Murphy I'd be fine with me
[02:47:38.120 --> 02:47:40.120]  I have to go to Miami to meet somebody
[02:47:40.120 --> 02:47:42.120]  at the Financial Times next week
[02:47:42.120 --> 02:47:44.120]  but I'd love to do it
[02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:46.120]  it's just have to see what Andrew's schedule is
[02:47:46.120 --> 02:47:48.120]  okay and you also talked about
[02:47:48.120 --> 02:47:50.120]  your other colleague working with him
[02:47:50.120 --> 02:47:52.120]  well he's an oil consultant
[02:47:52.120 --> 02:47:54.120]  but he's free I'm sure he'd love to do it
[02:47:54.120 --> 02:47:56.120]  sure I mean just the more the merrier
[02:47:56.120 --> 02:47:58.120]  getting your different perspectives here
[02:47:58.120 --> 02:48:00.120]  I want to thank you for your tireless 11-year
[02:48:00.120 --> 02:48:02.120]  effort it's certainly bearing fruit
[02:48:02.120 --> 02:48:04.120]  I mean there you were
[02:48:04.120 --> 02:48:06.120]  260 something bucks an ounce back
[02:48:06.120 --> 02:48:08.120]  when you started and it's a
[02:48:08.120 --> 02:48:10.120]  1145 today
[02:48:10.120 --> 02:48:12.120]  and so we're having a great victory
[02:48:12.120 --> 02:48:14.120]  I'm going to put you on hold sir
[02:48:14.120 --> 02:48:16.120]  and try to iron
[02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:18.120]  some of those basics out right now
[02:48:18.120 --> 02:48:20.120]  about getting the whistleblower
[02:48:20.120 --> 02:48:22.120]  on the show at your convenience
[02:48:22.120 --> 02:48:24.120]  Andrew McGuire perhaps we can get his contact
[02:48:24.120 --> 02:48:26.120]  info from you thank you so much
[02:48:26.120 --> 02:48:28.120]  for joining us sir anytime Alex
[02:48:28.120 --> 02:48:30.120]  alright amazing information
[02:48:30.120 --> 02:48:32.120]  I'm going to get his info now with
[02:48:32.120 --> 02:48:34.120]  Jaren and get
[02:48:34.120 --> 02:48:36.120]  that set up
[02:48:36.120 --> 02:48:38.120]  I tell you folks
[02:48:38.120 --> 02:48:40.120]  AP sued
[02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:42.120]  now it's 10 years
[02:48:42.120 --> 02:48:44.120]  ago and got all the internal
[02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:46.120]  minutes of the meetings between
[02:48:46.120 --> 02:48:48.120]  the big 10 oil companies how they said
[02:48:48.120 --> 02:48:50.120]  there's too much oil we're going to promote
[02:48:50.120 --> 02:48:52.120]  peak oil we're going to tell the school kids
[02:48:52.120 --> 02:48:54.120]  and everybody there's no oil we're going to fund
[02:48:54.120 --> 02:48:56.120]  the environmental movement to brainwash
[02:48:56.120 --> 02:48:58.120]  people about this and we're going to buy up
[02:48:58.120 --> 02:49:00.120]  the independent refineries and shut them
[02:49:00.120 --> 02:49:02.120]  down and we're going to
[02:49:02.120 --> 02:49:04.120]  restrict oil that way
[02:49:04.120 --> 02:49:06.120]  and the Pentagon comes out last week
[02:49:06.120 --> 02:49:08.120]  and says there's no more oil and within
[02:49:08.120 --> 02:49:10.120]  two years you're all going to be paying
[02:49:10.120 --> 02:49:12.120]  seven bucks a gallon
[02:49:12.120 --> 02:49:14.120]  water there's more water than
[02:49:14.120 --> 02:49:16.120]  ever
[02:49:16.120 --> 02:49:18.120]  there's all these ways to get water
[02:49:18.120 --> 02:49:20.120]  even in areas like southern California
[02:49:20.120 --> 02:49:22.120]  but they tell you even in areas
[02:49:22.120 --> 02:49:24.120]  of washing water like England oh you're
[02:49:24.120 --> 02:49:26.120]  going to pay double triple quadruple now
[02:49:26.120 --> 02:49:28.120]  water when England has more water than
[02:49:28.120 --> 02:49:30.120]  the other island nation and it's just
[02:49:30.120 --> 02:49:32.120]  the giant aquifers everywhere
[02:49:32.120 --> 02:49:34.120]  incredible precipitation huge reservoirs
[02:49:34.120 --> 02:49:36.120]  and it's just scams
[02:49:36.120 --> 02:49:38.120]  and here in Austin they just say
[02:49:38.120 --> 02:49:40.120]  hey
[02:49:40.120 --> 02:49:42.120]  we are going to give you
[02:49:42.120 --> 02:49:44.120]  a 2.6 billion this is Austin energy
[02:49:44.120 --> 02:49:46.120]  tax over the next three years on your natural
[02:49:46.120 --> 02:49:48.120]  gas and power that's more than all the taxes
[02:49:48.120 --> 02:49:50.120]  every year combined just one new tax
[02:49:50.120 --> 02:49:52.120]  bigger than everything combined
[02:49:52.120 --> 02:49:54.120]  and it's for the earth and for the children
[02:49:54.120 --> 02:49:56.120]  shut up
[02:49:56.120 --> 02:49:58.120]  we're going to do it
[02:49:58.120 --> 02:50:00.120]  we're lawless scum
[02:50:00.120 --> 02:50:02.120]  and who do they pay the money to the banks
[02:50:02.120 --> 02:50:04.120]  and the city of Austin has taken almost
[02:50:04.120 --> 02:50:06.120]  all the pension funds and invested it
[02:50:06.120 --> 02:50:08.120]  in the derivatives and now the bankers
[02:50:08.120 --> 02:50:10.120]  have come to them and said you better raise
[02:50:10.120 --> 02:50:12.120]  a bunch of taxes because there's going to be no money
[02:50:12.120 --> 02:50:14.120]  and they go and do I mean it's just
[02:50:14.120 --> 02:50:16.120]  we have to get out of bed
[02:50:16.120 --> 02:50:18.120]  with these crooks you're like well I'm not
[02:50:18.120 --> 02:50:20.120]  working with the crooks well neither am I
[02:50:20.120 --> 02:50:22.120]  but we're still in bed with them we still live
[02:50:22.120 --> 02:50:24.120]  in the city that absolute criminal scum
[02:50:24.120 --> 02:50:26.120]  run and they've already committed millions
[02:50:26.120 --> 02:50:28.120]  of crimes so why not commit 10 million more
[02:50:28.120 --> 02:50:30.120]  why not just steal everything
[02:50:30.120 --> 02:50:32.120]  they've already stolen
[02:50:32.120 --> 02:50:34.120]  everything that wasn't nailed down
[02:50:34.120 --> 02:50:36.120]  now they're in there with crowbars stealing
[02:50:36.120 --> 02:50:38.120]  what is nailed down they've taken the kitchen sink
[02:50:38.120 --> 02:50:40.120]  they're pulling the tile up they're pulling the drape sound
[02:50:40.120 --> 02:50:42.120]  they're now bulldozing the building
[02:50:42.120 --> 02:50:44.120]  for timber and we're in here
[02:50:44.120 --> 02:50:46.120]  with it collapsing going hey don't slay
[02:50:46.120 --> 02:50:48.120]  us and they're saying shut up terrorist
[02:50:48.120 --> 02:50:50.120]  you're planning to stage terror attacks
[02:50:50.120 --> 02:50:52.120]  we're like excuse me we're just

[02:54:22.120 --> 02:54:24.120]  communications network
[02:54:24.120 --> 02:54:26.120]  been a long proud sponsor of Alex Jones
[02:54:26.120 --> 02:54:28.120]  for gosh it's getting up to
[02:54:28.120 --> 02:54:30.120]  15 years now
[02:54:30.120 --> 02:54:32.120]  and there goes Bill Murphy what a good
[02:54:32.120 --> 02:54:34.120]  friend of mine he's been
[02:54:34.120 --> 02:54:36.120]  he knows more about what's been going on
[02:54:36.120 --> 02:54:38.120]  with the central banks and their manipulation
[02:54:38.120 --> 02:54:40.120]  that they've had in the gold market
[02:54:40.120 --> 02:54:42.120]  then
[02:54:42.120 --> 02:54:44.120]  short of the people that are doing it
[02:54:44.120 --> 02:54:46.120]  I mean he's the expert in the whole thing
[02:54:46.120 --> 02:54:48.120]  he's calling for over $3,000
[02:54:48.120 --> 02:54:50.120]  gold and that was we had him
[02:54:50.120 --> 02:54:52.120]  up there a week ago and now gold's up
[02:54:52.120 --> 02:54:54.120]  over a hundred bucks since he was here
[02:54:54.120 --> 02:54:56.120]  that's amazing
[02:54:56.120 --> 02:54:58.120]  you know gold now
[02:54:58.120 --> 02:55:00.120]  I was up here at the end of the hour last hour
[02:55:00.120 --> 02:55:02.120]  and gold was sitting at
[02:55:02.120 --> 02:55:04.120]  $1,245
[02:55:04.120 --> 02:55:06.120]  today
[02:55:06.120 --> 02:55:08.120]  now it's sitting at
[02:55:08.120 --> 02:55:10.120]  $1,249
[02:55:10.120 --> 02:55:12.120]  60
[02:55:12.120 --> 02:55:14.120]  that is almost $1,250
[02:55:14.120 --> 02:55:16.120]  an ounce
[02:55:16.120 --> 02:55:18.120]  we are very close to the end of this trading
[02:55:18.120 --> 02:55:20.120]  day and when it closes
[02:55:20.120 --> 02:55:22.120]  if it holds that number
[02:55:22.120 --> 02:55:24.120]  that gold has never seen before
[02:55:24.120 --> 02:55:26.120]  in its history
[02:55:26.120 --> 02:55:28.120]  against the US dollar
[02:55:28.120 --> 02:55:30.120]  obviously against the European
[02:55:30.120 --> 02:55:32.120]  EU
[02:55:32.120 --> 02:55:34.120]  gold has been trading at a much higher rate
[02:55:34.120 --> 02:55:36.120]  than it's ever seen before
[02:55:36.120 --> 02:55:38.120]  but now we're seeing it in the US dollar as well
[02:55:38.120 --> 02:55:40.120]  I mean the news is out there right now
[02:55:40.120 --> 02:55:42.120]  I mean gold ends at
[02:55:42.120 --> 02:55:44.120]  $1,243.10
[02:55:44.120 --> 02:55:46.120]  that's a closing for yesterday
[02:55:46.120 --> 02:55:48.120]  actually this morning's European news
[02:55:48.120 --> 02:55:50.120]  when the London market had closed
[02:55:50.120 --> 02:55:52.120]  they were shooting up like you wouldn't believe
[02:55:52.120 --> 02:55:54.120]  and we hit our last peak in December of
[02:55:54.120 --> 02:55:56.120]  2009 and I got to say this
[02:55:56.120 --> 02:55:58.120]  I priced these francs
[02:55:58.120 --> 02:56:00.120]  about the time that Bill Murphy was on the air
[02:56:00.120 --> 02:56:02.120]  which is about $1,245
[02:56:02.120 --> 02:56:04.120]  gold
[02:56:04.120 --> 02:56:06.120]  right now I've got them at $256.68
[02:56:08.120 --> 02:56:10.120]  if you go to the web offer
[02:56:10.120 --> 02:56:12.120]  it's over $270
[02:56:12.120 --> 02:56:14.120]  a coin now
[02:56:14.120 --> 02:56:16.120]  so you just can't beat it
[02:56:16.120 --> 02:56:18.120]  if you're looking to buy gold
[02:56:18.120 --> 02:56:20.120]  you're getting in
[02:56:20.120 --> 02:56:22.120]  we still have many other items
[02:56:22.120 --> 02:56:24.120]  available at very discounted rates
[02:56:24.120 --> 02:56:26.120]  but I got to tell you
[02:56:26.120 --> 02:56:28.120]  the premiums on the wholesale markets
[02:56:28.120 --> 02:56:30.120]  for the bullion and
[02:56:30.120 --> 02:56:32.120]  the older collector grade gold coins
[02:56:32.120 --> 02:56:34.120]  are going up
[02:56:34.120 --> 02:56:36.120]  the market is getting hot
[02:56:36.120 --> 02:56:38.120]  and like Bill Murphy said
[02:56:38.120 --> 02:56:40.120]  there's simply not enough physical supply
[02:56:40.120 --> 02:56:42.120]  on hand to meet the demand
[02:56:42.120 --> 02:56:44.120]  and now the central banks have lost control
[02:56:44.120 --> 02:56:46.120]  of the marketplace
[02:56:46.120 --> 02:56:48.120]  and they've regulated downward
[02:56:48.120 --> 02:56:50.120]  as they had in the past
[02:56:50.120 --> 02:56:52.120]  and that's why you're seeing what you're seeing
[02:56:52.120 --> 02:56:54.120]  Bill Murphy predicted it two weeks ago
[02:56:54.120 --> 02:56:56.120]  and here it is
[02:56:56.120 --> 02:56:58.120]  the guy is 100% accurate
[02:56:58.120 --> 02:57:00.120]  and like he said on his website
[02:57:00.120 --> 02:57:02.120]  he just simply hasn't been wrong
[02:57:02.120 --> 02:57:04.120]  and how could he be wrong
[02:57:04.120 --> 02:57:06.120]  you're measuring gold against a fiat currency
[02:57:06.120 --> 02:57:08.120]  that's being printed
[02:57:08.120 --> 02:57:10.120]  and shoved into the economy like nobody's business
[02:57:10.120 --> 02:57:12.120]  anyways
[02:57:12.120 --> 02:57:14.120]  francs right now at $256.68
[02:57:14.120 --> 02:57:16.120]  if you want to get a hold of us here at Midas
[02:57:16.120 --> 02:57:18.120]  our telephone number is
[02:57:18.120 --> 02:57:22.120]  1-800-686-2237

[02:57:26.120 --> 02:57:28.120]  and I must say
[02:57:28.120 --> 02:57:30.120]  that this has got to be one of the best days
[02:57:30.120 --> 02:57:32.120]  Alex had on air
[02:57:32.120 --> 02:57:34.120]  even though he's not even as on air right now
[02:57:34.120 --> 02:57:36.120]  it's a replay but the next part
[02:57:36.120 --> 02:57:38.120]  the next segment of the show
[02:57:38.120 --> 02:57:40.120]  is just as good as what you've been hearing
[02:57:40.120 --> 02:57:42.120]  in the past few hours
[02:57:42.120 --> 02:57:44.120]  it's a fabulous day to be listening to Alex Jones
[02:57:44.120 --> 02:57:46.120]  I would suggest that you stay tuned
[02:57:46.120 --> 02:57:48.120]  again it's that frank offer
[02:57:48.120 --> 02:57:50.120]  that I think is so special
[02:57:50.120 --> 02:57:52.120]  at this point in time
[02:57:52.120 --> 02:57:54.120]  because there are $256.68
[02:57:54.120 --> 02:57:56.120]  and if you put the fact in
[02:57:56.120 --> 02:57:58.120]  that I'm buying you a full year subscription
[02:57:58.120 --> 02:58:00.120]  to Bob Chapman's newsletter
[02:58:00.120 --> 02:58:02.120]  and we all know how important it is
[02:58:02.120 --> 02:58:04.120]  to be aware of what's going on in the marketplace today
[02:58:04.120 --> 02:58:06.120]  and Bob lays it out so clear
[02:58:06.120 --> 02:58:08.120]  and so
[02:58:08.120 --> 02:58:10.120]  45-50 pages

[02:58:12.120 --> 02:58:14.120]  it's a great value

[02:58:22.120 --> 02:58:24.120]  what a wonderful day it's been
[02:58:24.120 --> 02:58:26.120]  and I just want to wish Alex Jones
[02:58:26.120 --> 02:58:28.120]  a great day off

[02:58:58.120 --> 02:59:00.120]  has become reality
[02:59:00.120 --> 02:59:02.120]  it really says that the state is God
[02:59:02.120 --> 02:59:04.120]  the United States is now recognized globally
[02:59:04.120 --> 02:59:06.120]  as one of the most oppressive police states
[02:59:06.120 --> 02:59:08.120]  on earth
[02:59:08.120 --> 02:59:10.120]  this film conclusively proves the existence
[02:59:10.120 --> 02:59:12.120]  of a secret network of FEMA camps
[02:59:12.120 --> 02:59:14.120]  now being expanded nationwide
[02:59:14.120 --> 02:59:16.120]  this documentary exposes
[02:59:16.120 --> 02:59:18.120]  how the continuity of government program
[02:59:18.120 --> 02:59:20.120]  has established an old powerful shadow state
[02:59:20.120 --> 02:59:22.120]  police state 4 chronicles the sickening
[02:59:22.120 --> 02:59:24.120]  depths to which our republic has fallen
[02:59:24.120 --> 02:59:26.120]  prepare to enter the secret of world
[02:59:26.120 --> 02:59:28.120]  of emergency dictatorship
[02:59:28.120 --> 02:59:30.120]  body scammers, sound cameras
[02:59:30.120 --> 02:59:32.120]  citizen spies, staged terror
[02:59:32.120 --> 02:59:34.120]  and cameras on every street corner
[02:59:34.120 --> 02:59:36.120]  it's only the beginning
[02:59:36.120 --> 02:59:38.120]  of the new world order's hellish plan
[02:59:38.120 --> 02:59:40.120]  the police state isn't coming

[02:59:48.120 --> 02:59:54.120]  on TV
[03:00:18.120 --> 03:00:30.120]  the question is where should
[03:00:30.120 --> 03:00:32.120]  the American people draw their line
[03:00:32.120 --> 03:00:34.120]  in the sand
[03:00:34.120 --> 03:00:36.120]  first of all as a Texan I would like to point out
[03:00:36.120 --> 03:00:38.120]  this is a reference to the Alamo
[03:00:38.120 --> 03:00:40.120]  Colonel William Travis
[03:00:40.120 --> 03:00:42.120]  recognized that
[03:00:42.120 --> 03:00:44.120]  the outcome was hopeless
[03:00:44.120 --> 03:00:46.120]  and he told
[03:00:46.120 --> 03:00:48.120]  the men at the Alamo
[03:00:48.120 --> 03:00:50.120]  that he could not in good conscience
[03:00:50.120 --> 03:00:52.120]  order them
[03:00:52.120 --> 03:00:54.120]  to stay in fight
[03:00:54.120 --> 03:00:56.120]  he took his saber
[03:00:56.120 --> 03:00:58.120]  and drew a line in the sand
[03:00:58.120 --> 03:01:00.120]  and he indicated that
[03:01:00.120 --> 03:01:02.120]  regardless of what they did
[03:01:02.120 --> 03:01:04.120]  he, William Travis
[03:01:04.120 --> 03:01:06.120]  was going to stay at the Alamo
[03:01:06.120 --> 03:01:08.120]  and even if necessary
[03:01:08.120 --> 03:01:10.120]  single-handedly defend
[03:01:10.120 --> 03:01:12.120]  the fort
[03:01:12.120 --> 03:01:14.120]  the line in the sand
[03:01:14.120 --> 03:01:16.120]  has come to be
[03:01:16.120 --> 03:01:18.120]  your final straw
[03:01:18.120 --> 03:01:20.120]  the last outcome
[03:01:20.120 --> 03:01:22.120]  much like survival
[03:01:22.120 --> 03:01:24.120]  individual survival
[03:01:24.120 --> 03:01:26.120]  that is a personal issue
[03:01:26.120 --> 03:01:28.120]  we the people of the boss
[03:01:28.120 --> 03:01:30.120]  and when the government becomes destructive
[03:01:30.120 --> 03:01:32.120]  of the Constitution, of the Bill of Rights
[03:01:32.120 --> 03:01:34.120]  it is not just our job
[03:01:34.120 --> 03:01:36.120]  and our right, it is our duty
[03:01:36.120 --> 03:01:38.120]  to remove that government
[03:01:38.120 --> 03:01:40.120]  what does the Constitution tell us? Security
[03:01:40.120 --> 03:01:42.120]  where do we find that word?
[03:01:42.120 --> 03:01:44.120]  the word security appears in the Constitution
[03:01:44.120 --> 03:01:46.120]  a well-regulated militia
[03:01:46.120 --> 03:01:48.120]  being necessarily the security of a free state
[03:01:48.120 --> 03:01:50.120]  and the security of what?
[03:01:50.120 --> 03:01:52.120]  a police state?
[03:01:52.120 --> 03:01:54.120]  a free state
[03:01:54.120 --> 03:01:56.120]  and the only other place where the word
[03:01:56.120 --> 03:01:58.120]  related to security is used
[03:01:58.120 --> 03:02:00.120]  is the word secure in the preamble
[03:02:00.120 --> 03:02:02.120]  to secure the blessings of liberty
[03:02:02.120 --> 03:02:04.120]  to ourselves and our posterity
[03:02:04.120 --> 03:02:06.120]  look at this and say, aha
[03:02:06.120 --> 03:02:08.120]  whatever kind of homeland security operation
[03:02:08.120 --> 03:02:10.120]  we want, its goal has got to be a free state
[03:02:10.120 --> 03:02:12.120]  and the blessings of liberty to our people
[03:02:12.120 --> 03:02:14.120]  oh and by the way, the Constitution tells us what that is
[03:02:14.120 --> 03:02:16.120]  it's called a well-regulated militia
[03:02:16.120 --> 03:02:18.120]  and the reason we can be secure
[03:02:18.120 --> 03:02:20.120]  in knowing that the well-regulated militia
[03:02:20.120 --> 03:02:22.120]  will secure the security of a free state
[03:02:22.120 --> 03:02:24.120]  and the blessings of liberty is because it is composed of whom?
[03:02:24.120 --> 03:02:26.120]  the people themselves
[03:02:26.120 --> 03:02:28.120]  and they understood that was the proper way
[03:02:28.120 --> 03:02:30.120]  to defend a republic with free militias
[03:02:30.120 --> 03:02:32.120]  the only thing you need a standing army for
[03:02:32.120 --> 03:02:34.120]  is offensive military action
[03:02:34.120 --> 03:02:36.120]  the most powerful public servant
[03:02:36.120 --> 03:02:38.120]  in the county who is the sheriff
[03:02:38.120 --> 03:02:41.120]  the sheriff can kick the feds out of their county
[03:02:41.120 --> 03:02:44.120]  the sheriff is the most powerful individual
[03:02:44.120 --> 03:02:46.120]  but instead they've been taught
[03:02:46.120 --> 03:02:48.120]  that they have no power
[03:02:48.120 --> 03:02:50.120]  and in many states they're
[03:02:50.120 --> 03:02:52.120]  getting rid of the sheriff or turning the sheriff
[03:02:52.120 --> 03:02:54.120]  into a creature of the state
[03:02:54.120 --> 03:02:56.120]  or a creature of the city
[03:02:56.120 --> 03:02:58.120]  that the sheriff in this country really take
[03:02:58.120 --> 03:03:00.120]  their job seriously
[03:03:00.120 --> 03:03:02.120]  in protecting and serving
[03:03:02.120 --> 03:03:04.120]  the people of their county
[03:03:04.120 --> 03:03:06.120]  and my question is
[03:03:06.120 --> 03:03:08.120]  sheriff
[03:03:08.120 --> 03:03:10.120]  will you stand against tyranny?
[03:03:10.120 --> 03:03:12.120]  you have been warned
[03:03:12.120 --> 03:03:14.120]  we have the facts
[03:03:14.120 --> 03:03:15.120]  we have the constitution
[03:03:15.120 --> 03:03:16.120]  we have the bill of rights
[03:03:16.120 --> 03:03:17.120]  we have common law
[03:03:17.120 --> 03:03:19.120]  it is our basic
[03:03:19.120 --> 03:03:21.120]  human right to not be slaged
[03:03:21.120 --> 03:03:23.120]  to not be dominated by an out of control
[03:03:23.120 --> 03:03:25.120]  federal government itself
[03:03:25.120 --> 03:03:27.120]  totally taken over by foreign international banks
[03:03:27.120 --> 03:03:29.120]  that are looting this nation
[03:03:29.120 --> 03:03:31.120]  of tens of trillions of dollars a year
[03:03:31.120 --> 03:03:33.120]  don't tread on me cover so many subjects
[03:03:33.120 --> 03:03:35.120]  not just the line in the sand

[03:03:36.120 --> 03:03:38.120]  how to take our country back
[03:03:38.120 --> 03:03:39.120]  it is so important

[03:08:33.120 --> 03:08:37.120]  we're going to get into a cnn calling for one child policy

[03:08:43.120 --> 03:08:45.120]  we're going to be talking about that
[03:08:45.120 --> 03:08:47.120]  and the financial looting legislation

[03:08:49.120 --> 03:08:51.120]  or even the texas banking association
[03:08:51.120 --> 03:08:53.120]  saying it's a fraud takeover
[03:08:53.120 --> 03:08:55.120]  and another bailout to the big central banks
[03:08:55.120 --> 03:08:57.120]  that's coming up now i spent the last hour
[03:08:57.120 --> 03:08:59.120]  on fox news admitting
[03:08:59.120 --> 03:09:01.120]  that the government larry silverstein
[03:09:01.120 --> 03:09:03.120]  were looking at the control demolition
[03:09:03.120 --> 03:09:05.120]  of building seven and they're now admitting
[03:09:05.120 --> 03:09:07.120]  that they were considering blowing it up
[03:09:07.120 --> 03:09:09.120]  that's that's another big admission
[03:09:09.120 --> 03:09:11.120]  the articles bombshell silverstein wanted to demolish
[03:09:11.120 --> 03:09:13.120]  building seven on nine eleven
[03:09:13.120 --> 03:09:15.120]  and the fox news article
[03:09:15.120 --> 03:09:17.120]  is called shame on jesse ventura
[03:09:17.120 --> 03:09:19.120]  and that's where they admit it that their reporter was there
[03:09:19.120 --> 03:09:21.120]  and oh it's no big deal that we were going to blow it up
[03:09:21.120 --> 03:09:23.120]  so all these years later
[03:09:23.120 --> 03:09:25.120]  all the video a cop saying get back
[03:09:25.120 --> 03:09:27.120]  the government's going to blow it up
[03:09:27.120 --> 03:09:29.120]  they ignored all that here's another admission
[03:09:29.120 --> 03:09:31.120]  it is a big deal
[03:09:31.120 --> 03:09:33.120]  all right shifting gears for the balance of the hour

[03:10:03.120 --> 03:10:05.120]  neurosurgical residency at the medical university
[03:10:05.120 --> 03:10:07.120]  of south carolina and charleston
[03:10:07.120 --> 03:10:09.120]  during his residency he ran the neurology program
[03:10:09.120 --> 03:10:11.120]  for one year and did a fellowship
[03:10:11.120 --> 03:10:13.120]  in neurosurgery after his residency
[03:10:13.120 --> 03:10:15.120]  for the past 25 plus years he's participated
[03:10:15.120 --> 03:10:17.120]  in neurosurgery in addition to having
[03:10:17.120 --> 03:10:19.120]  a nutritional practice he recently retired
[03:10:19.120 --> 03:10:21.120]  from both practices to devote full time
[03:10:21.120 --> 03:10:23.120]  to nutritional studies and research
[03:10:23.120 --> 03:10:25.120]  during his residency trained training
[03:10:25.120 --> 03:10:27.120]  he worked with the eminent neurosurgeon
[03:10:27.120 --> 03:10:29.120]  Dr. Ludwig Kempe together they developed
[03:10:29.120 --> 03:10:31.120]  the trans
[03:10:31.120 --> 03:10:33.120]  and it's all scientific terms
[03:10:33.120 --> 03:10:35.120]  removal of intervascular
[03:10:35.120 --> 03:10:37.120]  tumors which is one of the most
[03:10:37.120 --> 03:10:39.120]  widely used systems today
[03:10:39.120 --> 03:10:41.120]  he has presented their cases utilizing
[03:10:41.120 --> 03:10:43.120]  the technique to the congress of neurological
[03:10:43.120 --> 03:10:45.120]  surgeons look it's a long bio
[03:10:45.120 --> 03:10:47.120]  multi pages I'm going to stop right there
[03:10:47.120 --> 03:10:49.120]  and of course we've had many other medical doctors
[03:10:49.120 --> 03:10:51.120]  and brain surgeons
[03:10:51.120 --> 03:10:53.120]  and endocrinologist
[03:10:53.120 --> 03:10:55.120]  and just on
[03:10:55.120 --> 03:10:57.120]  backing up what he's saying but he has
[03:10:57.120 --> 03:10:59.120]  all the studies this stuff is not secret
[03:10:59.120 --> 03:11:01.120]  and
[03:11:01.120 --> 03:11:03.120]  we're going to be discussing it with him today
[03:11:03.120 --> 03:11:05.120]  but he was very critical of the h1n1
[03:11:05.120 --> 03:11:07.120]  he pointed out that it popped up in the wrong hemisphere
[03:11:07.120 --> 03:11:09.120]  wrong time of year many other scientists
[03:11:09.120 --> 03:11:11.120]  a virologist said it was engineered in the lab
[03:11:11.120 --> 03:11:13.120]  we know that
[03:11:13.120 --> 03:11:15.120]  other big companies
[03:11:15.120 --> 03:11:17.120]  with the bird flu killed a bunch of people
[03:11:17.120 --> 03:11:19.120]  that was the London telegraph in fact google
[03:11:19.120 --> 03:11:21.120]  homeless die and bird flu
[03:11:21.120 --> 03:11:23.120]  vaccine trial that got
[03:11:23.120 --> 03:11:25.120]  covered up and then
[03:11:25.120 --> 03:11:27.120]  what three months ago we had
[03:11:27.120 --> 03:11:29.120]  Wolfgang Woodrig a medical doctor from
[03:11:29.120 --> 03:11:31.120]  Germany on who ran the EU
[03:11:31.120 --> 03:11:33.120]  47 nation board
[03:11:33.120 --> 03:11:35.120]  so I'm just
[03:11:35.120 --> 03:11:37.120]  prefacing this before we go to him
[03:11:37.120 --> 03:11:39.120]  47 nation board
[03:11:39.120 --> 03:11:41.120]  that found that
[03:11:41.120 --> 03:11:43.120]  the UN and others were paid off by
[03:11:43.120 --> 03:11:45.120]  Big Pharma to lie and create this hoax
[03:11:45.120 --> 03:11:47.120]  and now we have all this mainstream news
[03:11:47.120 --> 03:11:49.120]  New Canadian study
[03:11:49.120 --> 03:11:51.120]  suggests seasonal flu shot increased h1n1 risk
[03:11:51.120 --> 03:11:53.120]  here's another one
[03:11:53.120 --> 03:11:55.120]  who
[03:11:55.120 --> 03:11:57.120]  admits that they exaggerated
[03:11:57.120 --> 03:11:59.120]  the dangers of h1n1
[03:11:59.120 --> 03:12:01.120]  times of India
[03:12:01.120 --> 03:12:03.120]  here's another one seasonal flu shot
[03:12:03.120 --> 03:12:05.120]  may increase h1n1 western australian reports
[03:12:05.120 --> 03:12:07.120]  of adverse reactions to seasonal
[03:12:07.120 --> 03:12:09.120]  flu and h1n1
[03:12:09.120 --> 03:12:11.120]  millions of h1n1 vaccine
[03:12:11.120 --> 03:12:13.120]  have been recalled Washington Post
[03:12:13.120 --> 03:12:15.120]  so again
[03:12:15.120 --> 03:12:17.120]  Dr. Blalock and others got attacked by the mainstream media
[03:12:17.120 --> 03:12:19.120]  for even questioning this
[03:12:19.120 --> 03:12:21.120]  well here they are vindicated yet again
[03:12:21.120 --> 03:12:23.120]  so we're going to talk about the flu in hindsight
[03:12:23.120 --> 03:12:25.120]  and then other toxins in our food and water
[03:12:25.120 --> 03:12:27.120]  Dr. Blalock thanks for joining us
[03:12:27.120 --> 03:12:29.120]  thank you Alex
[03:12:29.120 --> 03:12:31.120]  good to have you here well you've got the floor let's talk about
[03:12:31.120 --> 03:12:33.120]  vaccines, mercury
[03:12:33.120 --> 03:12:35.120]  your studies
[03:12:35.120 --> 03:12:37.120]  that you've looked at about the increases of Alzheimer's
[03:12:37.120 --> 03:12:39.120]  brain damage
[03:12:39.120 --> 03:12:41.120]  explain what's really going on here
[03:12:41.120 --> 03:12:43.120]  well
[03:12:43.120 --> 03:12:45.120]  I think just a brief review
[03:12:45.120 --> 03:12:47.120]  of this whole fiasco of h1n1
[03:12:47.120 --> 03:12:49.120]  is very telling
[03:12:49.120 --> 03:12:51.120]  and we need to remember this next year
[03:12:51.120 --> 03:12:53.120]  because this is going to be revisited
[03:12:53.120 --> 03:12:55.120]  we're going to go through the same thing
[03:12:55.120 --> 03:12:57.120]  all over again and you remember
[03:12:57.120 --> 03:12:59.120]  the major government organization
[03:12:59.120 --> 03:13:01.120]  CDC
[03:13:01.120 --> 03:13:03.120]  the Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
[03:13:03.120 --> 03:13:05.120]  National Institute of Health
[03:13:05.120 --> 03:13:07.120]  all of them were just sending the same message out
[03:13:07.120 --> 03:13:09.120]  that this is going to be a killer virus
[03:13:09.120 --> 03:13:11.120]  it's going to
[03:13:11.120 --> 03:13:13.120]  target pregnant women
[03:13:13.120 --> 03:13:15.120]  it's going to target young people
[03:13:15.120 --> 03:13:17.120]  it's going to be the most devastating thing we've ever seen
[03:13:17.120 --> 03:13:19.120]  World Health Organization
[03:13:19.120 --> 03:13:21.120]  of course started this nonsense
[03:13:21.120 --> 03:13:23.120]  yet when you actually
[03:13:23.120 --> 03:13:25.120]  got into the journals
[03:13:25.120 --> 03:13:27.120]  the real high tech journals
[03:13:27.120 --> 03:13:29.120]  that were discussing this
[03:13:29.120 --> 03:13:31.120]  it didn't match what the government was saying
[03:13:31.120 --> 03:13:33.120]  and we talked about our government
[03:13:33.120 --> 03:13:35.120]  as well as the
[03:13:35.120 --> 03:13:37.120]  the international body
[03:13:37.120 --> 03:13:39.120]  the UN
[03:13:39.120 --> 03:13:41.120]  World Health Organization
[03:13:41.120 --> 03:13:43.120]  what the science was actually saying
[03:13:43.120 --> 03:13:45.120]  is that this virus is
[03:13:45.120 --> 03:13:47.120]  difficult to transmit
[03:13:47.120 --> 03:13:49.120]  more difficult than the seasonal flu
[03:13:49.120 --> 03:13:51.120]  that it is
[03:13:51.120 --> 03:13:53.120]  not that pathogenic
[03:13:53.120 --> 03:13:55.120]  and they didn't expect it to cause
[03:13:55.120 --> 03:13:57.120]  that much death
[03:13:57.120 --> 03:13:59.120]  all of this science
[03:13:59.120 --> 03:14:01.120]  reported in the best of the science journals
[03:14:01.120 --> 03:14:03.120]  was ignored
[03:14:03.120 --> 03:14:05.120]  even the CDC
[03:14:05.120 --> 03:14:07.120]  was secretly
[03:14:07.120 --> 03:14:09.120]  doing studies
[03:14:09.120 --> 03:14:11.120]  which found that this virus is very difficult
[03:14:11.120 --> 03:14:13.120]  to transmit
[03:14:13.120 --> 03:14:15.120]  yet when you turned on your television
[03:14:15.120 --> 03:14:17.120]  here's the news media saying
[03:14:17.120 --> 03:14:19.120]  oh this is so easy to transmit
[03:14:19.120 --> 03:14:21.120]  it's just going to spread all over the world
[03:14:21.120 --> 03:14:23.120]  we're expecting the ICU
[03:14:23.120 --> 03:14:25.120]  the Intensive Care Unit
[03:14:25.120 --> 03:14:27.120]  to be overwhelmed
[03:14:27.120 --> 03:14:29.120]  we're not going to have enough respirators
[03:14:29.120 --> 03:14:31.120]  for all the people that's going to need them
[03:14:31.120 --> 03:14:33.120]  young women are going to die
[03:14:33.120 --> 03:14:35.120]  that are pregnant in mass numbers
[03:14:35.120 --> 03:14:37.120]  they were putting out figures
[03:14:37.120 --> 03:14:39.120]  of 90,000
[03:14:39.120 --> 03:14:41.120]  expected to die
[03:14:41.120 --> 03:14:43.120]  on and on and on
[03:14:43.120 --> 03:14:45.120]  yet the science the whole time was saying
[03:14:45.120 --> 03:14:47.120]  none of that's true
[03:14:47.120 --> 03:14:49.120]  when you actually got on the CDC
[03:14:49.120 --> 03:14:51.120]  you found out
[03:14:51.120 --> 03:14:53.120]  well
[03:14:53.120 --> 03:14:55.120]  your whole basis
[03:14:55.120 --> 03:14:57.120]  mass vaccination
[03:14:57.120 --> 03:14:59.120]  and threat of force vaccination
[03:14:59.120 --> 03:15:01.120]  has no foundation whatsoever
[03:15:01.120 --> 03:15:03.120]  from your own data
[03:15:03.120 --> 03:15:05.120]  when it soon became obvious
[03:15:05.120 --> 03:15:07.120]  that
[03:15:07.120 --> 03:15:09.120]  the number of infections
[03:15:09.120 --> 03:15:11.120]  by H1N1
[03:15:11.120 --> 03:15:13.120]  was nowhere near
[03:15:13.120 --> 03:15:15.120]  what the government was saying
[03:15:15.120 --> 03:15:17.120]  and at the death rate was far less
[03:15:17.120 --> 03:15:19.120]  than 100 of 1%
[03:15:19.120 --> 03:15:21.120]  so that means your chances
[03:15:21.120 --> 03:15:23.120]  of being seriously ill
[03:15:23.120 --> 03:15:25.120]  or dying from this flu
[03:15:25.120 --> 03:15:27.120]  was less than
[03:15:27.120 --> 03:15:29.120]  99.9%
[03:15:31.120 --> 03:15:33.120]  so it was less dangerous
[03:15:33.120 --> 03:15:35.120]  than the regular seasonal flu
[03:15:35.120 --> 03:15:37.120]  and then
[03:15:37.120 --> 03:15:39.120]  when the actual flu came through
[03:15:39.120 --> 03:15:41.120]  its first big wave
[03:15:41.120 --> 03:15:43.120]  is exactly what we saw
[03:15:43.120 --> 03:15:45.120]  the death rate for the entire world
[03:15:45.120 --> 03:15:47.120]  was astronomically low
[03:15:47.120 --> 03:15:49.120]  incredibly low
[03:15:49.120 --> 03:15:51.120]  well then their next
[03:15:51.120 --> 03:15:53.120]  method
[03:15:53.120 --> 03:15:55.120]  of scaring the public was
[03:15:55.120 --> 03:15:57.120]  oh we're watching a southern hemisphere
[03:15:57.120 --> 03:15:59.120]  we're expecting millions to die
[03:15:59.120 --> 03:16:01.120]  well the flu went through
[03:16:01.120 --> 03:16:03.120]  the southern hemisphere
[03:16:03.120 --> 03:16:05.120]  in both of its ways
[03:16:05.120 --> 03:16:07.120]  it had one of the lowest death rates
[03:16:07.120 --> 03:16:09.120]  of any flu season that's ever been recorded
[03:16:09.120 --> 03:16:11.120]  and that includes
[03:16:11.120 --> 03:16:13.120]  young children that includes
[03:16:13.120 --> 03:16:15.120]  pregnant women that includes
[03:16:15.120 --> 03:16:17.120]  young all the so called targeted
[03:16:17.120 --> 03:16:19.120]  age groups
[03:16:19.120 --> 03:16:21.120]  and then I started to looking at
[03:16:21.120 --> 03:16:23.120]  the New England Journal of Medicine
[03:16:23.120 --> 03:16:25.120]  which was doing the largest studies
[03:16:25.120 --> 03:16:27.120]  on the flu in southern and northern
[03:16:27.120 --> 03:16:29.120]  hemisphere and ironically
[03:16:29.120 --> 03:16:31.120]  they left out one of the most important
[03:16:31.120 --> 03:16:33.120]  factors in the people that were dying
[03:16:33.120 --> 03:16:35.120]  and asked that they were obese
[03:16:35.120 --> 03:16:37.120]  and that they were smoking
[03:16:37.120 --> 03:16:39.120]  well they did mention
[03:16:39.120 --> 03:16:41.120]  the obese connection but it never
[03:16:41.120 --> 03:16:43.120]  entered the media
[03:16:43.120 --> 03:16:45.120]  well doctor most of the deaths we saw
[03:16:45.120 --> 03:16:47.120]  were people who were 75
[03:16:47.120 --> 03:16:49.120]  years old had double
[03:16:49.120 --> 03:16:51.120]  amputations from diabetes
[03:16:51.120 --> 03:16:53.120]  had lung problems and then I would see
[03:16:53.120 --> 03:16:55.120]  a month later that oh this fellow in
[03:16:55.120 --> 03:16:57.120]  Austin really didn't die it was a false
[03:16:57.120 --> 03:16:59.120]  positive H1N1
[03:16:59.120 --> 03:17:01.120]  they died of complications from something else
[03:17:01.120 --> 03:17:03.120]  so there was also lots of hyping
[03:17:03.120 --> 03:17:05.120]  people who hadn't died from it
[03:17:05.120 --> 03:17:07.120]  well everything they said about it
[03:17:07.120 --> 03:17:09.120]  ended up alive in other words they were
[03:17:09.120 --> 03:17:11.120]  saying well the people were dying
[03:17:11.120 --> 03:17:13.120]  from bacterial pneumonia after they got
[03:17:13.120 --> 03:17:15.120]  the flu and that it was pneumococcal
[03:17:15.120 --> 03:17:17.120]  pneumonia therefore they needed pneumococcal
[03:17:17.120 --> 03:17:19.120]  vaccine as well well
[03:17:19.120 --> 03:17:21.120]  when you look at the autopsy report
[03:17:21.120 --> 03:17:23.120]  it says well most of the pneumonias
[03:17:23.120 --> 03:17:25.120]  were not pneumococcal and there
[03:17:25.120 --> 03:17:27.120]  was no vaccine to protect anybody
[03:17:27.120 --> 03:17:29.120]  from and as you said
[03:17:29.120 --> 03:17:31.120]  most of these people had serious
[03:17:31.120 --> 03:17:33.120]  illnesses diabetes or
[03:17:33.120 --> 03:17:35.120]  autoimmune diseases
[03:17:35.120 --> 03:17:37.120]  immune deficiency diseases
[03:17:37.120 --> 03:17:39.120]  cancer so even in
[03:17:39.120 --> 03:17:41.120]  the children that were dying they were
[03:17:41.120 --> 03:17:43.120]  sick children they were not normal healthy
[03:17:43.120 --> 03:17:45.120]  children but if they could find
[03:17:45.120 --> 03:17:47.120]  a so-called healthy person
[03:17:47.120 --> 03:17:49.120]  that died from it or became
[03:17:49.120 --> 03:17:51.120]  seriously ill that's the
[03:17:51.120 --> 03:17:53.120]  one they plastered all over the news
[03:17:53.120 --> 03:17:55.120]  so they would tell the public oh
[03:17:55.120 --> 03:17:57.120]  you're a healthy teenager
[03:17:57.120 --> 03:17:59.120]  is that horrendous risk look here's the
[03:17:59.120 --> 03:18:01.120]  case they had to search high and low
[03:18:01.120 --> 03:18:03.120]  to find the case
[03:18:03.120 --> 03:18:05.120]  most of the cases were from sick children
[03:18:05.120 --> 03:18:07.120]  well it's even worse than that
[03:18:07.120 --> 03:18:09.120]  sick children and sick adults
[03:18:09.120 --> 03:18:11.120]  you had very few cases
[03:18:11.120 --> 03:18:13.120]  of anyone else dying from this flu
[03:18:13.120 --> 03:18:15.120]  it was all concocted
[03:18:15.120 --> 03:18:17.120]  from A to Z and this
[03:18:17.120 --> 03:18:19.120]  is what's so upsetting
[03:18:19.120 --> 03:18:21.120]  about the
[03:18:21.120 --> 03:18:23.120]  government the government
[03:18:23.120 --> 03:18:25.120]  knew all of this they had access
[03:18:25.120 --> 03:18:27.120]  to the same information I did
[03:18:27.120 --> 03:18:29.120]  so they knew
[03:18:29.120 --> 03:18:31.120]  from the very beginning
[03:18:31.120 --> 03:18:33.120]  and all throughout that this was
[03:18:33.120 --> 03:18:35.120]  a lie this was all
[03:18:35.120 --> 03:18:37.120]  nothing but a concocted
[03:18:37.120 --> 03:18:39.120]  epidemic to sell vaccines
[03:18:39.120 --> 03:18:41.120]  and to do damage
[03:18:41.120 --> 03:18:43.120]  to large numbers of people in this country
[03:18:43.120 --> 03:18:45.120]  now you remember
[03:18:45.120 --> 03:18:47.120]  when I first talked to you about this
[03:18:47.120 --> 03:18:49.120]  when all this started
[03:18:49.120 --> 03:18:51.120]  I said Gideon Barray is going to be a big danger
[03:18:51.120 --> 03:18:53.120]  of this vaccine
[03:18:53.120 --> 03:18:55.120]  particularly in the countries where they're using
[03:18:55.120 --> 03:18:57.120]  the mf59 azimuth
[03:18:57.120 --> 03:18:59.120]  well let me interrupt you let me interrupt you
[03:18:59.120 --> 03:19:01.120]  doctor I know
[03:19:01.120 --> 03:19:03.120]  a whole bunch of people talk show hosts
[03:19:03.120 --> 03:19:05.120]  that are 42 years old you name it
[03:19:05.120 --> 03:19:07.120]  that went and got the shot
[03:19:07.120 --> 03:19:09.120]  the feet are still numb and they got Gideon Barray
[03:19:09.120 --> 03:19:11.120]  and I know people that are in the hospital
[03:19:11.120 --> 03:19:13.120]  dying right now I know
[03:19:13.120 --> 03:19:15.120]  a whole bunch of people in Austin
[03:19:15.120 --> 03:19:17.120]  that took it and are in deep trouble
[03:19:17.120 --> 03:19:19.120]  well my point
[03:19:19.120 --> 03:19:21.120]  being is when they first started this
[03:19:21.120 --> 03:19:23.120]  they said oh we're carefully
[03:19:23.120 --> 03:19:25.120]  tracking Gideon Barray because
[03:19:25.120 --> 03:19:27.120]  the risk factor have you heard
[03:19:27.120 --> 03:19:29.120]  any major network to a follow up
[03:19:29.120 --> 03:19:31.120]  you've seen it in any newspaper
[03:19:31.120 --> 03:19:33.120]  a follow up of what they found
[03:19:33.120 --> 03:19:35.120]  but what you're saying exactly true
[03:19:35.120 --> 03:19:37.120]  because I get emails from all over the world
[03:19:37.120 --> 03:19:39.120]  and all over the country
[03:19:39.120 --> 03:19:41.120]  of people telling me this
[03:19:41.120 --> 03:19:43.120]  thing stories back one
[03:19:43.120 --> 03:19:45.120]  person doc stay there
[03:19:45.120 --> 03:19:47.120]  doc sorry to interrupt we got a break come back and tell us that story
[03:19:47.120 --> 03:19:49.120]  on the other side I've got a list
[03:19:49.120 --> 03:19:51.120]  of questions for you
[03:19:51.120 --> 03:19:53.120]  what was really in the vaccine well we have
[03:19:53.120 --> 03:19:55.120]  the insert but you can tell us what these
[03:19:55.120 --> 03:19:57.120]  what these ingredients mean stay with us

[03:22:31.120 --> 03:22:33.120]  to establish an oppressive world
[03:22:33.120 --> 03:22:35.120]  government
[03:22:35.120 --> 03:22:37.120]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world

[03:24:05.120 --> 03:24:07.120]  Dr. Russell Blalock is our guest
[03:24:07.120 --> 03:24:09.120]  we find out a lot more information
[03:24:09.120 --> 03:24:11.120]  at his websites to give you those several times
[03:24:11.120 --> 03:24:13.120]  before he leaves us
[03:24:13.120 --> 03:24:15.120]  but while you were talking Dr. you were trying to finish up
[03:24:15.120 --> 03:24:17.120]  a story
[03:24:17.120 --> 03:24:19.120]  about the reports you're getting but I mean I have
[03:24:19.120 --> 03:24:21.120]  family friends
[03:24:21.120 --> 03:24:23.120]  my dad has scores of patients
[03:24:23.120 --> 03:24:25.120]  that he knows that have gone to the hospital
[03:24:25.120 --> 03:24:27.120]  many of them have recovered thank god
[03:24:27.120 --> 03:24:29.120]  and the doctors are even telling them
[03:24:29.120 --> 03:24:31.120]  and I've seen this a few places in the news
[03:24:31.120 --> 03:24:33.120]  but it's not a big news story like you were saying
[03:24:33.120 --> 03:24:35.120]  that yes you have Guillain-Barre
[03:24:35.120 --> 03:24:37.120]  and we believe the vaccine caused it
[03:24:37.120 --> 03:24:39.120]  in fact talking to Dale Dudley
[03:24:39.120 --> 03:24:41.120]  who has the number one talk show
[03:24:41.120 --> 03:24:43.120]  in the morning on 93.7
[03:24:43.120 --> 03:24:45.120]  it's the sister station to 590
[03:24:45.120 --> 03:24:47.120]  our local affiliate the AM
[03:24:47.120 --> 03:24:49.120]  I mean he has numb fingers
[03:24:49.120 --> 03:24:51.120]  and numb toes and he went to the doctor
[03:24:51.120 --> 03:24:53.120]  and they said the vaccine did this to you
[03:24:53.120 --> 03:24:55.120]  but that was the seasonal shot he took
[03:24:55.120 --> 03:24:57.120]  go ahead
[03:24:57.120 --> 03:24:59.120]  I got an email from
[03:24:59.120 --> 03:25:01.120]  a man who said
[03:25:01.120 --> 03:25:03.120]  he felt so bad because
[03:25:03.120 --> 03:25:05.120]  he had encouraged
[03:25:05.120 --> 03:25:07.120]  his father to get the H1N1
[03:25:07.120 --> 03:25:09.120]  vaccine and he got it
[03:25:09.120 --> 03:25:11.120]  and his father ended up
[03:25:11.120 --> 03:25:13.120]  with a severe case at Guillain-Barre
[03:25:13.120 --> 03:25:15.120]  ended up on a respirator for 3 months
[03:25:15.120 --> 03:25:17.120]  and it just
[03:25:17.120 --> 03:25:19.120]  got out of the hospital and he felt
[03:25:19.120 --> 03:25:21.120]  fairly weak
[03:25:21.120 --> 03:25:23.120]  while they were in the hospital
[03:25:23.120 --> 03:25:25.120]  they saw a 10 year old
[03:25:25.120 --> 03:25:27.120]  child who
[03:25:27.120 --> 03:25:29.120]  ended up with Guillain-Barre
[03:25:29.120 --> 03:25:31.120]  ended up on a respirator for over a month
[03:25:31.120 --> 03:25:33.120]  and is still on the respirator
[03:25:33.120 --> 03:25:35.120]  I've gotten over
[03:25:35.120 --> 03:25:37.120]  a list of
[03:25:37.120 --> 03:25:39.120]  200 women who lost their babies
[03:25:39.120 --> 03:25:41.120]  because
[03:25:41.120 --> 03:25:43.120]  they believe the government hiked that women
[03:25:43.120 --> 03:25:45.120]  needed to get the H1N1
[03:25:45.120 --> 03:25:47.120]  vaccine during pregnancy
[03:25:47.120 --> 03:25:49.120]  and I warned people of that
[03:25:49.120 --> 03:25:51.120]  that you would have
[03:25:51.120 --> 03:25:53.120]  a tremendous number of
[03:25:53.120 --> 03:25:55.120]  spontaneous abortions
[03:25:55.120 --> 03:25:57.120]  and
[03:25:57.120 --> 03:25:59.120]  the big risk, the really big thing
[03:25:59.120 --> 03:26:01.120]  is to show that if you
[03:26:01.120 --> 03:26:03.120]  over-stimulate immunity during
[03:26:03.120 --> 03:26:05.120]  pregnancy
[03:26:05.120 --> 03:26:07.120]  you increase the incidence of schizophrenia
[03:26:07.120 --> 03:26:09.120]  and autism
[03:26:09.120 --> 03:26:11.120]  as much as 10 fold
[03:26:11.120 --> 03:26:13.120]  so we still have to wait
[03:26:13.120 --> 03:26:15.120]  and see what is going to be
[03:26:15.120 --> 03:26:17.120]  the full impact of this because it's going to take
[03:26:17.120 --> 03:26:19.120]  a good 10 years
[03:26:19.120 --> 03:26:21.120]  before we know
[03:26:21.120 --> 03:26:23.120]  just how many people's babies
[03:26:23.120 --> 03:26:25.120]  have been ruined
[03:26:25.120 --> 03:26:27.120]  by this vaccine. This isn't like that tranquilizer
[03:26:27.120 --> 03:26:29.120]  in the 40s and 50s where they came out
[03:26:29.120 --> 03:26:31.120]  deformed and you saw it right away
[03:26:31.120 --> 03:26:33.120]  but again you're a medical doctor
[03:26:33.120 --> 03:26:35.120]  and brain surgeon but let's talk about
[03:26:35.120 --> 03:26:37.120]  why this does that to the brain
[03:26:37.120 --> 03:26:39.120]  but I remember just reading
[03:26:39.120 --> 03:26:41.120]  in the inserts of vaccines period
[03:26:41.120 --> 03:26:43.120]  they had always said don't give
[03:26:43.120 --> 03:26:45.120]  them to pregnant women and now sickeningly
[03:26:45.120 --> 03:26:47.120]  they were on the news saying
[03:26:47.120 --> 03:26:49.120]  pregnant women particularly
[03:26:49.120 --> 03:26:51.120]  need this. I mean this is diabolical
[03:26:51.120 --> 03:26:53.120]  Well they were doing that
[03:26:53.120 --> 03:26:55.120]  at the time there was
[03:26:55.120 --> 03:26:57.120]  convincing evidence from our research
[03:26:57.120 --> 03:26:59.120]  in neuroscience that if
[03:26:59.120 --> 03:27:01.120]  you stimulate the immune system
[03:27:01.120 --> 03:27:03.120]  of a pregnant woman
[03:27:03.120 --> 03:27:05.120]  mid term
[03:27:05.120 --> 03:27:07.120]  you know in mid pregnancy
[03:27:07.120 --> 03:27:09.120]  you produce this high incidence
[03:27:09.120 --> 03:27:11.120]  of autism and schizophrenia
[03:27:11.120 --> 03:27:13.120]  well
[03:27:13.120 --> 03:27:15.120]  I don't think I would trade
[03:27:15.120 --> 03:27:17.120]  having my child
[03:27:17.120 --> 03:27:19.120]  have autism or schizophrenia
[03:27:19.120 --> 03:27:21.120]  for this false idea
[03:27:21.120 --> 03:27:23.120]  that we can protect them during pregnancy
[03:27:23.120 --> 03:27:25.120]  because there's no evidence
[03:27:25.120 --> 03:27:27.120]  the vaccine had any protection whatsoever
[03:27:27.120 --> 03:27:29.120]  of anybody but what about the autoimmune response
[03:27:29.120 --> 03:27:31.120]  what about the autoimmune response
[03:27:31.120 --> 03:27:33.120]  from the medical stuff I read correct me if I'm wrong
[03:27:33.120 --> 03:27:35.120]  the miscarriage is though
[03:27:35.120 --> 03:27:37.120]  throughout the pregnancy the body
[03:27:37.120 --> 03:27:39.120]  gets overstimulated and then
[03:27:39.120 --> 03:27:41.120]  sees the fetus as an outsider
[03:27:41.120 --> 03:27:43.120]  yeah
[03:27:43.120 --> 03:27:45.120]  you know that's part of it
[03:27:45.120 --> 03:27:47.120]  it appears
[03:27:47.120 --> 03:27:49.120]  during the baby's development
[03:27:49.120 --> 03:27:51.120]  with the placenta
[03:27:51.120 --> 03:27:53.120]  so that the oxygen
[03:27:53.120 --> 03:27:55.120]  and blood supply of the baby
[03:27:55.120 --> 03:27:57.120]  is damaged
[03:27:57.120 --> 03:27:59.120]  and you have a spontaneous abortion
[03:27:59.120 --> 03:28:01.120]  and this was occurring
[03:28:01.120 --> 03:28:03.120]  in women who were almost near term
[03:28:03.120 --> 03:28:05.120]  so
[03:28:05.120 --> 03:28:07.120]  here they were almost ready to have their baby
[03:28:07.120 --> 03:28:09.120]  and they lost it
[03:28:09.120 --> 03:28:11.120]  well if you look at the scientific
[03:28:11.120 --> 03:28:13.120]  literature you're not surprised by that
[03:28:13.120 --> 03:28:15.120]  but
[03:28:15.120 --> 03:28:17.120]  the media played a big role
[03:28:17.120 --> 03:28:19.120]  in getting these women
[03:28:19.120 --> 03:28:21.120]  to go take this ridiculous
[03:28:21.120 --> 03:28:23.120]  vaccine
[03:28:23.120 --> 03:28:25.120]  and as I say
[03:28:25.120 --> 03:28:27.120]  there's just compelling research
[03:28:27.120 --> 03:28:29.120]  that if you vaccinate
[03:28:29.120 --> 03:28:31.120]  with these powerful vaccines
[03:28:31.120 --> 03:28:33.120]  because they contain
[03:28:33.120 --> 03:28:35.120]  aluminum or mercury
[03:28:35.120 --> 03:28:37.120]  it produces
[03:28:37.120 --> 03:28:39.120]  abnormal development of the brain
[03:28:39.120 --> 03:28:41.120]  and produces long term
[03:28:41.120 --> 03:28:43.120]  changes in the brain that makes
[03:28:43.120 --> 03:28:45.120]  that child at high risk
[03:28:45.120 --> 03:28:47.120]  of neurodegenerative diseases
[03:28:47.120 --> 03:28:49.120]  like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's
[03:28:49.120 --> 03:28:51.120]  for the rest of their life
[03:28:51.120 --> 03:28:53.120]  they become hypersensitive to
[03:28:53.120 --> 03:28:55.120]  environmental toxins like
[03:28:55.120 --> 03:28:57.120]  pesticides and herbicides
[03:28:57.120 --> 03:28:59.120]  for the rest of their life
[03:28:59.120 --> 03:29:01.120]  this has been shown repeatedly
[03:29:01.120 --> 03:29:03.120]  in the laboratory
[03:29:03.120 --> 03:29:05.120]  yet here we have a government policy
[03:29:05.120 --> 03:29:07.120]  because of payoffs
[03:29:07.120 --> 03:29:09.120]  from big farmer
[03:29:09.120 --> 03:29:11.120]  food companies
[03:29:11.120 --> 03:29:13.120]  and government agencies that are pushing this
[03:29:13.120 --> 03:29:15.120]  agenda
[03:29:15.120 --> 03:29:17.120]  they're totally ignoring this research
[03:29:17.120 --> 03:29:19.120]  and nobody's refuted it
[03:29:19.120 --> 03:29:21.120]  nobody's come back and said
[03:29:21.120 --> 03:29:23.120]  well that's not true because it is true
[03:29:23.120 --> 03:29:25.120]  it's very well accepted
[03:29:25.120 --> 03:29:27.120]  in neuroscience
[03:29:27.120 --> 03:29:29.120]  and these are the type of things
[03:29:29.120 --> 03:29:31.120]  that concern me
[03:29:31.120 --> 03:29:33.120]  Dr. Blalock got a break
[03:29:33.120 --> 03:29:35.120]  long segment coming up that won't interrupt you
[03:29:35.120 --> 03:29:37.120]  for 18 minutes when we return
[03:29:37.120 --> 03:29:39.120]  Dr. Russell Blalock is our guest
[03:29:39.120 --> 03:29:41.120]  the website is RussellBlalockMD.com
[03:29:41.120 --> 03:29:43.120]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com
[03:29:43.120 --> 03:29:45.120]  we're going to get into other
[03:29:45.120 --> 03:29:47.120]  toxins in the environment
[03:29:47.120 --> 03:29:49.120]  what are they doing? Stay with us

[03:31:01.000 --> 03:31:05.240]  Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret
[03:31:05.240 --> 03:31:09.440]  storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid
[03:31:09.440 --> 03:31:13.440]  seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed
[03:31:13.440 --> 03:31:16.880]  even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[03:31:16.880 --> 03:31:22.320]  again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[03:31:22.320 --> 03:31:28.000]  seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[03:31:28.000 --> 03:31:32.520]  dense food for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically
[03:31:32.520 --> 03:31:37.920]  modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so
[03:31:37.920 --> 03:31:43.480]  visit them today at survival seed bank dot com that's survival seed bank dot com or give
[03:31:43.480 --> 03:31:55.280]  them a call at 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds
[03:31:55.280 --> 03:32:00.520]  are the ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for survival seed bank dot com this
[03:32:00.520 --> 03:32:05.400]  is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[03:32:05.400 --> 03:32:10.200]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[03:32:10.200 --> 03:32:14.320]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to
[03:32:14.320 --> 03:32:19.720]  have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[03:32:19.720 --> 03:32:24.960]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[03:32:24.960 --> 03:32:30.160]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[03:32:30.160 --> 03:32:34.360]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[03:32:34.360 --> 03:32:39.000]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful
[03:32:39.000 --> 03:32:43.160]  backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators
[03:32:43.160 --> 03:32:47.480]  offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information
[03:32:47.480 --> 03:32:54.320]  at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun

[03:33:10.240 --> 03:33:28.560]  a radio talk show host in austin who took the seasonal dot gion beret for months was getting
[03:33:28.560 --> 03:33:44.440]  fake fact sheets at the pharmacies and at the colleges and government building saying there's
[03:33:44.440 --> 03:34:01.180]  a lot of people on the street saying this is not a secret they know what they're doing

[03:36:28.200 --> 03:36:39.520]  center dot com blaylock wellness center dot com okay so I was ranting there about the
[03:36:39.520 --> 03:36:45.120]  fact that that that they know I mean on the insert that really came with the h1n1 and
[03:36:45.120 --> 03:36:50.840]  the seasonal it says can cause neurological disorder geon beret can reduce fertility can
[03:36:50.840 --> 03:36:55.360]  cause cancer and we've shown that over and over again and I believe I want you to talk
[03:36:55.360 --> 03:37:00.240]  about this that that not only do we have a record low flu season worldwide both seasonal
[03:37:00.240 --> 03:37:04.700]  and h1n1 but the wall street journal had to admit a month ago we covered this several
[03:37:04.700 --> 03:37:11.160]  times here on air if anybody wants to pull it up that it was record low for people taking
[03:37:11.160 --> 03:37:15.560]  vaccines and now canadian studies show they have four different studies I'm sure you've
[03:37:15.560 --> 03:37:20.880]  seen them but it's in mainstream news even MSNBC that that people that had taken the
[03:37:20.880 --> 03:37:26.080]  seasonal flu shot were upwards of four times more likely to contract and actually have
[03:37:26.080 --> 03:37:33.000]  a problem with the h1n1 so can you speak to that and what's in these vaccines yeah that's
[03:37:33.000 --> 03:37:38.080]  a canadian study came out right in the middle of all of this and they were still screaming
[03:37:38.080 --> 03:37:42.880]  if you need to get the vaccine the canadian study showed that if you took the vaccine
[03:37:42.880 --> 03:37:49.880]  it at least doubled your risk of contracting h1n1 an indian study out of india found the
[03:37:49.880 --> 03:37:58.440]  same thing yet it had no impact on the US policy it did the canadian policy a lot of
[03:37:58.440 --> 03:38:04.160]  my material was going to a friend of mine in the Czech Republic and he was translating
[03:38:04.160 --> 03:38:11.360]  it to the Czech and they were going throughout the media while the interestingly the secretary
[03:38:11.360 --> 03:38:17.760]  of health for the Czech Republic was encouraging everyone to get the vaccine and said she took
[03:38:17.760 --> 03:38:24.240]  it the president of the Czech Republic said he wouldn't take it he was scared of the vaccine
[03:38:24.240 --> 03:38:31.240]  well guess who got the infection the secretary of health rather than the h1n1 they had one
[03:38:31.240 --> 03:38:36.520]  million doses the vaccine ordered for the Czech Republic they have eight hundred thousand
[03:38:36.520 --> 03:38:41.960]  doses that are sitting no one will take it so the vast majority of people listen to the
[03:38:41.960 --> 03:38:49.000]  advice that didn't take the vaccine now thing these people need to understand about vaccines
[03:38:49.000 --> 03:38:55.520]  this is not just the h1n1 but all vaccines the big secret in the vaccine manufacturing
[03:38:55.520 --> 03:39:01.360]  is that they're all contaminated and they admit they don't know how to get contaminating
[03:39:01.360 --> 03:39:09.160]  viruses and microplasma out of these vaccines it's impossible they're top experts that
[03:39:09.160 --> 03:39:16.720]  admitted that the other thing is almost all the vaccines are now manufactured in china
[03:39:16.720 --> 03:39:24.600]  the united states fda is not allowed to enter any plant that manufactures vaccines in china
[03:39:24.600 --> 03:39:31.800]  they're allowed to come one every twelve years and they can look at the record that the chinese
[03:39:31.800 --> 03:39:37.360]  communist officials give them and that's how they make the determination that it states
[03:39:37.360 --> 03:39:42.800]  let's say that again the communist chinese who have a eugenics policy one-child policy
[03:39:42.800 --> 03:39:47.720]  that meshes with the people that run our government they're making and some numbers
[03:39:47.720 --> 03:39:53.120]  i've seen upwards of ninety percent of the vaccines that we take in europe and the united
[03:39:53.120 --> 03:40:00.800]  states but more so in the u.s. are being made by china i mean this this is amazing well
[03:40:00.800 --> 03:40:07.760]  these are the chinese that contaminated a colster that's estimated to kill ten at least ten
[03:40:07.760 --> 03:40:15.360]  thousand people worldwide they contaminated baby foods you know they've been involved
[03:40:15.360 --> 03:40:22.120]  in numerous scandals of contaminating products all over the world and yet we turn over something
[03:40:22.120 --> 03:40:26.640]  like vaccinations to the chinese government and we're not even allowed to look inside
[03:40:26.640 --> 03:40:33.600]  their factory we just take the millions of doses of vaccines that come from these chinese
[03:40:33.600 --> 03:40:39.720]  plants they're not even examined once they're manufactured by the fda but even in the best
[03:40:39.720 --> 03:40:46.200]  of cases you cannot sterilize now the viruses that in there they admit there may be dozens
[03:40:46.200 --> 03:40:51.560]  of viruses that cause cancer well just two weeks ago doctor it was in the news that millions
[03:40:51.560 --> 03:40:57.120]  of vaccines have this pig cancer virus in it and and and i've read the government reports
[03:40:57.120 --> 03:41:01.800]  declassified in the seventies that over a hundred million americans were given the polio
[03:41:01.800 --> 03:41:09.360]  a vaccine that had a what is it sv 40 which which gives people cancer yeah and they prove
[03:41:09.360 --> 03:41:16.520]  on that the really scary thing of this sv 40 polio vaccine is that it's vertically transmitted
[03:41:16.520 --> 03:41:22.880]  what's unicable is the virus goes through each generation so your parents transmitted
[03:41:22.880 --> 03:41:29.000]  to you you transmitted to your children on down the line and they're seeing a lot of really
[03:41:29.000 --> 03:41:37.480]  terrible malignant diseases like mesothelioma and uh megaloplastoma at the moment in which
[03:41:37.480 --> 03:41:44.120]  they're isolating this sv 40 virus is because of the virus in these horrible malignancies
[03:41:44.120 --> 03:41:50.280]  in children today showing that it's still being transmitted through generations because
[03:41:50.280 --> 03:41:55.080]  you said they've estimated a hundred million people contaminated well well more than that
[03:41:55.080 --> 03:41:58.840]  i saw an indian study and correct me if i'm wrong this is years ago that was in the major
[03:41:58.840 --> 03:42:05.520]  indian papers that 100 percent of their municipal service systems were filled with sv 40 from
[03:42:05.520 --> 03:42:12.240]  the vaccines and not only is it intergenerational uh passed on uh from parent to parent uh from
[03:42:12.240 --> 03:42:17.200]  parents to children they're offspring but that it is transmittable from person to person
[03:42:17.200 --> 03:42:24.560]  yeah and and this this is a big word because this is a major carcinogenic virus uh you
[03:42:24.560 --> 03:42:30.160]  know and the and the government scientists that just go been over backwards to try to
[03:42:30.160 --> 03:42:36.520]  to make the case that that this is not a dangerous virus forever they denied it was even a carcinogenic
[03:42:36.520 --> 03:42:44.680]  virus uh until it was absolutely proven in an NIH lab uh then since then they said well
[03:42:44.680 --> 03:42:50.360]  we'll do epidemiologic studies in the united states and see if there's any increased cancer
[03:42:50.360 --> 03:42:54.920]  since we've given the polio vaccine and so they came out with a big denial where we didn't
[03:42:54.920 --> 03:43:00.200]  see any increased cancer right well the people that know about epidemiology studies said well
[03:43:00.200 --> 03:43:06.680]  the study was fixed so it wouldn't show uh and so uh you know now that they've actually
[03:43:06.680 --> 03:43:13.800]  typed the virus and uh from the tumors themselves there's no denying it's not a contaminant it
[03:43:13.800 --> 03:43:19.560]  is the causation of some of the worst malignancies of children we know of well doctor let me stop
[03:43:19.560 --> 03:43:25.240]  you again uh just from memory what four months ago the ap reported that all over the world
[03:43:25.240 --> 03:43:33.400]  un polio vaccine is quote giving the children a quote weaponized super polio but that was just in a
[03:43:33.400 --> 03:43:38.760]  few newspapers and then we see i mean i've talked to other medical doctors i'm going to ask you if
[03:43:38.760 --> 03:43:44.200]  this is true but that 30 40 50 years ago when they were in residency finishing up their medical
[03:43:44.200 --> 03:43:49.000]  degree that they would take them into the ward and show them a 10 year old with cancer and it
[03:43:49.000 --> 03:43:55.080]  was like finding a four leaf clover or a leprechaun it was so rare and now everywhere i go there's five
[03:43:55.080 --> 03:44:00.760]  10 year old kids just dying everywhere of cancers and many times it's linked to formerly rare cancers
[03:44:00.760 --> 03:44:05.240]  that have been conclusively proven to be tied in with the sv 40 so a can you speak to that and then b
[03:44:05.880 --> 03:44:10.840]  come on we know this isn't an accident i mean they're eugenicist well i mean we have all
[03:44:10.840 --> 03:44:15.560]  these government documents where they want to reduce our numbers well it is true about the
[03:44:15.560 --> 03:44:23.720]  incidence of these cancers uh and all of us older guys talk about that how these cancers we're seeing
[03:44:23.720 --> 03:44:32.040]  now we're so rare uh you were lucky to see one of these cases in medical school and in your residency
[03:44:32.040 --> 03:44:38.680]  training now we're just seeing them everywhere things like pancreatic cancer you speak extremely rare
[03:44:39.480 --> 03:44:46.280]  lymphoma was nowhere near the incidence that it is now now it is the number one malignancy and 30
[03:44:46.280 --> 03:44:53.560]  year old uh and rising all the time uh so we're seeing a great number of diseases and even things
[03:44:53.560 --> 03:45:01.560]  like asthma asthma has increased uh over 10 bold in the last couple decades and it's estimated that
[03:45:01.560 --> 03:45:07.080]  it's the the vaccine program that's producing it why is it causing a height to the over auto immune
[03:45:07.080 --> 03:45:15.480]  response yes an auto uh an auto immune response from the components in the vaccine and we also know
[03:45:15.480 --> 03:45:21.560]  that type one diabetes you know diabetes is related to vaccines this is a new study just came out made
[03:45:21.560 --> 03:45:27.640]  a very strong case for it all right yes their attitude is well it's more important that we
[03:45:27.640 --> 03:45:34.040]  vaccinate everybody than we worry about a couple hundred thousand kids who are crippled every year
[03:45:34.840 --> 03:45:41.000]  and thousands will die uh from complications these vaccines and you're not contaminating the whole
[03:45:41.000 --> 03:45:46.680]  population uh with these viruses that are contaminated you can't get rid of the virus these
[03:45:46.680 --> 03:45:52.280]  viruses are incorporated in your genetic structure they're passed on to your children and grandchildren
[03:45:52.280 --> 03:45:56.280]  let me stop you again because there's so many points i want to cover with you this is incredible
[03:45:56.280 --> 03:46:02.760]  i have to do a part two you're so gracious to spend this time with us um going back and i just
[03:46:02.760 --> 03:46:09.880]  had the article up on screen mainstream news reported and and this was going on in april
[03:46:09.880 --> 03:46:15.880]  and may and june of last year that last year's seasonal flu and this year's seasonal flu
[03:46:17.080 --> 03:46:19.720]  some of the major companies were putting an h1n1
[03:46:20.360 --> 03:46:24.600]  simulant and then i had medical doctors on that explained that viral simulant was really an
[03:46:24.600 --> 03:46:30.760]  attenuated virus and so now that's why they're saying you take the seasonal flu then you get h1n1
[03:46:30.760 --> 03:46:36.440]  which is what four different studies out of canada and you mentioned one out of india have shown uh
[03:46:36.440 --> 03:46:42.200]  uh so please speak to that but then overall second question is it the good news that we're
[03:46:42.200 --> 03:46:46.920]  having record numbers of people refuse vaccines because people are finally getting wise to this
[03:46:46.920 --> 03:46:53.720]  go ahead well you know it it's true that they're manipulating these vaccines all the time and
[03:46:53.720 --> 03:46:59.640]  they're not telling the public what they're doing uh you know they're putting bars and they're putting
[03:46:59.640 --> 03:47:06.520]  antics in uh these vaccines and no one's telling the public of what's being added to these vaccines
[03:47:08.520 --> 03:47:16.040]  now your your second observation uh what's happening is secretly since we had this disaster
[03:47:16.040 --> 03:47:22.520]  with h1n1 we should have been the learning lesson right at that time merc pharmaceutical
[03:47:22.520 --> 03:47:30.920]  was secretly going to the state legislature to get them to overturn uh exemption law so that you
[03:47:30.920 --> 03:47:38.120]  couldn't refuse the vaccine uh because they were so upset that so many people have refused the vaccine
[03:47:38.120 --> 03:47:46.120]  in this season uh and right here in my own state i know of uh this this action taking place and in
[03:47:46.120 --> 03:47:53.720]  your state you know it's govern perry uh was uh getting the garden cell as a mandatory vaccine
[03:47:53.720 --> 03:48:01.400]  because he was getting money from uh merc pharmaceutical uh so our our state politicians
[03:48:02.440 --> 03:48:08.120]  are people we need to keep an eye on because they're gonna override uh exemptions to these
[03:48:08.120 --> 03:48:13.400]  vaccines and force people to do it uh the other thing is new health care bill that was
[03:48:13.400 --> 03:48:19.960]  asked if anybody bothers to read it inside it said all vaccines recommended by the cdc will be
[03:48:19.960 --> 03:48:24.520]  made available well that doesn't just mean made available it means you will take them
[03:48:25.240 --> 03:48:29.320]  or you cannot get health care in the united states well we know they tried in new york and
[03:48:29.320 --> 03:48:34.280]  massachusetts to force people to take it so we know this is what they have in mind and i want to get
[03:48:34.280 --> 03:48:38.680]  you back on about health care it's so much that we could pick your brain about here and we're running
[03:48:38.680 --> 03:48:43.400]  out of time what about garden cell i mean i remember four years ago in the trials it was in the news
[03:48:43.400 --> 03:48:48.920]  that it was killing a large percentage statistically one of the most dangerous vaccines ever this
[03:48:48.920 --> 03:48:54.360]  this cancer virus and then the insert admitted didn't even protect you but from a few strains
[03:48:54.360 --> 03:48:58.680]  and there's thousands of these things and then rick perry came out and said you must take it
[03:48:58.680 --> 03:49:02.600]  which was another hoax he just put it on the list of recommended through the health department and
[03:49:02.600 --> 03:49:07.240]  now they want to make boys take it and people are dying all over and they just don't give a damn
[03:49:07.240 --> 03:49:13.800]  well it's a worthless vaccine and there's a new study out that shows that just uh increasing
[03:49:13.800 --> 03:49:20.600]  certain nutrients in your diet reduces cervical cancer by 85 percent well that vaccine is nowhere
[03:49:20.600 --> 03:49:27.320]  near that effected so if you truly wanted to prevent cervical cancer uh in young girls all you
[03:49:27.320 --> 03:49:32.040]  need to do is give them a couple of nutrients supplement but of course they would never do
[03:49:32.040 --> 03:49:37.320]  that because it's so big profits for the best thing or not let them have sex with people sure i mean
[03:49:37.320 --> 03:49:44.600]  you could do something really drastic and that has reestablished uh a moral principle uh in which
[03:49:44.600 --> 03:49:51.560]  you're not having sex with everybody you meet in the shopping mall uh but you know that's so
[03:49:51.560 --> 03:49:57.720]  drastic according to the collectivist left-wing viewpoint we can't dare turn back the clock
[03:49:57.720 --> 03:50:04.200]  because that that would just violate the laws of the universe according to their way of thinking
[03:50:04.200 --> 03:50:10.280]  but you know we we've got to reestablish the foundation of morality we've got to reestablish
[03:50:10.280 --> 03:50:17.800]  these things and just tell the far left and extreme uh uh social engineers uh we're no
[03:50:17.800 --> 03:50:22.680]  longer going to listen to their nonsense because everything they've they've engineered in the last
[03:50:22.680 --> 03:50:29.320]  uh 70 years it's both disaster i mean the whole sex education thing was their idea it was going to
[03:50:29.320 --> 03:50:35.720]  stop uh uh teenage pregnancy it was going to stop the spread of a venereal disease well both
[03:50:35.720 --> 03:50:40.840]  have been prisoned astronomically since their brilliant social engineering program well they're
[03:50:40.840 --> 03:50:46.440]  really eugenics plan absolutely doctor we got to break again stay there amazing information

[03:54:35.160 --> 03:54:40.440]  all they talk about is putting things in your food water and your vaccines to sterilize you and
[03:54:40.440 --> 03:54:46.600]  dumb you down I know that sounds horrible and hard to believe but I mean here here's the times of
[03:54:46.600 --> 03:54:52.200]  London it was also an ABC news billionaire club and bid to curb overpopulation and it says America's
[03:54:52.200 --> 03:54:56.600]  richest people met in secret at Rockefeller University and at the end it says for a world
[03:54:56.600 --> 03:55:02.840]  government to carry out population reduction and I've got seeing in here yesterday calling for a
[03:55:02.840 --> 03:55:08.120]  one-child policy listen there's a reason China is at the heart of this new world order and they're

[03:55:22.840 --> 03:55:27.880]  you've read the same documents I've read I mean am I joking around when I say the elite are saying
[03:55:27.880 --> 03:55:33.880]  they want to do this to us and then two plus two equals four it's happening well there's been a
[03:55:33.880 --> 03:55:39.880]  great number of books written about population control which if you're really interested in
[03:55:39.880 --> 03:55:47.400]  if you have any questions about this you say you can get on government websites you can get on
[03:55:47.400 --> 03:55:55.720]  foundations there's a number of powerful foundations that are supplying billions of dollars for this
[03:55:55.720 --> 03:56:02.520]  purpose world population control and if you read the literature I mean these are some of the most
[03:56:02.520 --> 03:56:07.560]  powerful people in the world if you read their literature they openly talk about how we've got
[03:56:07.560 --> 03:56:14.360]  to drastically reduce the population of the world and how everybody that survives this population
[03:56:14.360 --> 03:56:21.080]  control are going to benefit enormously because so much land will be available it'll be easier to
[03:56:21.080 --> 03:56:26.840]  feed the population there'll be less disease on and on and on they give all this this justification
[03:56:27.400 --> 03:56:33.960]  well there's a lot of people in powerful positions who believe this I've had a number of my position
[03:56:33.960 --> 03:56:40.040]  colleagues who agree with it and and the doctor's lounge will tell you well I think that that the
[03:56:40.040 --> 03:56:46.040]  population needs to be drastically let me interrupt you again my dad you know he's an oral surgeon
[03:56:46.040 --> 03:56:51.560]  in Dennis he has a lot of physician friends and when he went to college he said in the 60s this
[03:56:51.560 --> 03:56:59.160]  was the majority view and what these people don't understand is these physicians aren't elitist either
[03:56:59.160 --> 03:57:03.640]  their kids are taking this stuff see the average yuppie doctor and I want to get your comment on
[03:57:03.640 --> 03:57:08.440]  this they think they're immune for this you know it's fine to yeah we're spiking those black people
[03:57:08.440 --> 03:57:13.880]  shots in Africa what these immoral people control freaks on power trips don't get is this is being
[03:57:13.880 --> 03:57:19.720]  done to everybody isn't it well exactly right in and it's the delusion that somehow they're
[03:57:19.720 --> 03:57:25.800]  going to be in the group that's going to be spared uh and when you look at it the history of this
[03:57:25.800 --> 03:57:32.040]  collectivist movement uh those are the people that are going to be included in the ones to be removed
[03:57:32.760 --> 03:57:39.400]  uh you know I spoke on your program one time about uh dr lily he wrote the molecular vision
[03:57:39.400 --> 03:57:45.000]  of the wife which was the history of molecular biology in America well she is a very highly
[03:57:45.000 --> 03:57:51.240]  regarded historian of molecular science and that's what the book's about but it she goes in great
[03:57:51.240 --> 03:57:58.360]  detail showing how the Rockefeller family uh had engineered with all of their friends these multi
[03:57:58.360 --> 03:58:04.920]  millionaires particularly through the foundation uh a program that caused drastic reductions in
[03:58:04.920 --> 03:58:10.840]  in human population he was absolutely obsessed with it now this is one of the wealthiest men in
[03:58:10.840 --> 03:58:18.440]  the entire world uh owned tens of thousands of corporations either directly and directly
