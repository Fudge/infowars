[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Dr. Reiner Fulmick is the public frontman for an international team comprised of hundreds
[00:10.000 --> 00:17.680]  of lawyers and medical experts who have begun legal proceedings over the CDC, the WHO,
[00:17.680 --> 00:22.920]  and the Davos group for committing crimes against humanity.
[00:22.920 --> 00:30.680]  The protocol for the PCR test given by the WHO and the CDC was knowingly set to a level
[00:30.680 --> 00:36.040]  that guaranteed 100% false positives or false negatives.
[00:36.040 --> 00:37.800]  So there is no pandemic.
[00:37.800 --> 00:41.040]  This is all about getting people to take the shot.
[00:41.040 --> 00:47.040]  Their argument is that we are at the very least being subjected to an illegal experiment.
[00:47.040 --> 00:49.760]  And at the worst, global genocide.
[00:49.760 --> 00:55.280]  Dr. Fulmick points out how the experimental jab is in clear violation of all 10 of the
[00:55.280 --> 01:02.080]  Nuremberg codes, which carry the penalty of death for those who violate them.
[01:02.080 --> 01:06.440]  Number one, voluntary consent is absolutely essential.
[01:06.440 --> 01:13.240]  There should be no intervention or any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, or any form
[01:13.240 --> 01:15.880]  of constraint or coercion.
[01:15.880 --> 01:22.080]  By definition, a vaccine must provide immunity to the virus, protect recipients from getting
[01:22.080 --> 01:29.160]  the virus, reduce deaths, infections, circulation, and transmission of the virus.
[01:29.160 --> 01:35.840]  We are told the experimental jab does none of these, yet they fraudulently call it a
[01:35.840 --> 01:36.840]  vaccine.
[01:36.840 --> 01:41.720]  As far as duress, constraint, and coercion, it's everywhere.
[01:41.720 --> 01:45.320]  If you want your life back, get the shot.
[01:45.320 --> 01:51.200]  Number two, the experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results unprocurable by
[01:51.200 --> 01:53.000]  other methods.
[01:53.000 --> 01:57.680]  The most fruitful method would be a healthy immune system, which can be achieved through
[01:57.680 --> 02:03.880]  good health and natural supplements such as vitamin D, vitamin C, and zinc.
[02:03.880 --> 02:05.960]  But the people are not being told this.
[02:05.960 --> 02:10.760]  In fact, those who point it out are being vilified and silenced.
[02:10.760 --> 02:17.200]  Number three, the experiment should be designed and based on the results of animal experimentation.
[02:17.200 --> 02:20.600]  This experimental jab skipped animal testing.
[02:20.600 --> 02:26.880]  Number four, the experiment should be so conducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical
[02:26.880 --> 02:29.880]  and mental suffering and injury.
[02:29.880 --> 02:35.640]  According to official reports, there are already thousands of deaths and over a quarter million
[02:35.640 --> 02:38.480]  injuries from this experiment.
[02:38.480 --> 02:43.800]  Number five, no experiment should be conducted where there is an a priori reason to believe
[02:43.800 --> 02:47.560]  that death or disabling injury will occur.
[02:47.560 --> 02:52.440]  Past trials have shown a strong possibility that these new spike proteins will cause a
[02:52.440 --> 02:54.920]  body to attack itself.
[02:54.920 --> 03:01.360]  This is known as antibody dependent enhancement, or ADE, and recent doctors have blown the
[03:01.360 --> 03:08.040]  whistle that this could end up killing everybody who's been vaccinated in the next two years.
[03:08.040 --> 03:11.840]  Number six, the risk should never exceed the benefit.
[03:11.840 --> 03:18.520]  COVID-19 has a 98 to 99% survival rate, less deadly than the seasonal flu.
[03:18.520 --> 03:25.480]  The experimental jab is already the most dangerous vaccine in VAERS 30 year history.
[03:25.480 --> 03:31.240]  Number seven, proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to
[03:31.240 --> 03:38.120]  protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability,
[03:38.120 --> 03:39.120]  or death.
[03:39.120 --> 03:40.840]  There were no preparations made.
[03:40.840 --> 03:42.360]  There are no facilities.
[03:42.360 --> 03:46.440]  The subject shows up for their shot and goes home.
[03:46.440 --> 03:52.840]  Number eight, the experiment should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons.
[03:52.840 --> 04:00.040]  This experiment has been exclusively run by politicians, the media, celebrities, and
[04:00.040 --> 04:02.760]  big pharma bureaucrats.
[04:02.760 --> 04:08.920]  Number nine, the subject should be at liberty to bring the experiment to an end.
[04:08.920 --> 04:13.560]  Thousands of medical experts have attempted to end this madness, and their voices continue
[04:13.560 --> 04:15.400]  to be silenced.
[04:15.400 --> 04:21.280]  Number 10, the experiment must be brought to an end if resulting in injury or death,
[04:21.280 --> 04:24.680]  and yet the experiment pushes on.
[04:24.680 --> 04:31.480]  Once again, those who violate these international laws are subject to the death penalty.
[04:31.480 --> 04:36.000]  Legal proceedings are moving forward and evidence is being collected.
[04:36.000 --> 04:43.920]  Whistleblowers are directed to contact the international team at www.securewhistleblower.com.
[04:43.920 --> 04:48.280]  This is likely the biggest crime ever committed against the world population.
[04:48.280 --> 04:53.920]  The question is, do we still have a judicial system to exact justice?
[04:53.920 --> 04:57.200]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Ries.
[04:57.200 --> 05:05.760]  It's not a secret why in the leftist controlled cities all over the world, not just the U.S.,
[05:05.760 --> 05:09.680]  they encourage people to live in tents and cities as homeless, and to use drugs and alcohol
[05:09.680 --> 05:11.120]  and engage in petty crime.
[05:11.120 --> 05:16.560]  It's because the globalists admit under Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, of course the Great Reset,
[05:16.560 --> 05:18.040]  they want to lower expectations.
[05:18.040 --> 05:21.640]  They don't want you to think of having sanitary systems everywhere.
[05:21.640 --> 05:24.400]  They don't want you to think of a civilization that gets better.
[05:24.400 --> 05:27.880]  They want you to think of a civilization that gets progressively worse.
[05:27.880 --> 05:29.640]  The globalists fly around in private jets.
[05:29.640 --> 05:31.800]  They have huge private mistakes.
[05:31.800 --> 05:33.400]  They are separate from us.
[05:33.400 --> 05:35.240]  Their children go to private tutors.
[05:35.240 --> 05:36.240]  They admit this.
[05:36.240 --> 05:41.720]  And now they want us to lock down, telecommunicating with each other, so that we are not actually
[05:41.720 --> 05:45.000]  out physically building a pro-human infrastructure.
[05:45.000 --> 05:49.520]  The infrastructure that's left under 5G has been a controlled robot in autonomous cars
[05:49.520 --> 05:50.520]  and trucks.
[05:50.520 --> 05:52.240]  So this is all their admitted plan.
[05:52.240 --> 05:55.640]  The public's finally listening because the plan is no longer in beta.
[05:55.640 --> 05:56.640]  It's gone operational.
[05:56.640 --> 05:57.640]  It's a post-human future.
[05:57.640 --> 05:58.640]  You better find out about it right now.
[05:58.640 --> 05:59.640]  Man, come on, man.
[05:59.640 --> 06:00.640]  I ain't finna go Alex Jones level with y'all, man.
[06:00.640 --> 06:01.640]  Come on, man.
[06:01.640 --> 06:02.640]  What y'all want?
[06:02.640 --> 06:03.640]  Like, wake up!
[06:03.640 --> 06:04.640]  I want people to wake up right now.
[06:04.640 --> 06:15.640]  I want people to listen to me and just come out of your trance.
[06:15.640 --> 06:20.000]  We have got to realize that we're being conditioned on a mass scale.
[06:20.000 --> 06:23.560]  So Alex Jones' whole brand is based on the idea.
[06:23.560 --> 06:25.880]  He's giving you the real story, not the fake news out there.
[06:25.880 --> 06:26.880]  Hey, listen.
[06:26.880 --> 06:27.880]  I'm here to warn people.
[06:27.880 --> 06:28.880]  You keep telling me to shut up.
[06:28.880 --> 06:29.880]  This isn't a game.
[06:29.880 --> 06:30.880]  Humanity is awakening.
[06:30.880 --> 06:31.880]  Infowars.com.
[06:31.880 --> 06:32.880]  This is Alex Jones.
[06:32.880 --> 06:33.880]  The tyrants did it.
[06:33.880 --> 06:34.880]  Himmler took the guns.
[06:34.880 --> 06:35.880]  Stalin took the guns.
[06:35.880 --> 06:36.880]  Malts took the guns.
[06:36.880 --> 06:46.000]  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearm.
[06:46.000 --> 06:47.000]  Alex Jones.
[06:47.000 --> 06:48.000]  Infowars.com.
[06:48.000 --> 06:49.000]  I just don't know who you are.
[06:49.000 --> 06:50.000]  You guys know who he is?
[06:50.000 --> 06:51.000]  You know Alex Jones has Infowars?
[06:51.000 --> 06:52.000]  Very popular.
[06:52.000 --> 06:53.000]  Infowars.
[06:53.000 --> 06:54.000]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[06:54.000 --> 06:55.000]  You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[06:55.000 --> 06:56.000]  We know we're under attack.
[06:56.000 --> 06:57.000]  We know it.
[06:57.000 --> 06:58.000]  We're breaking the conditioning.
[06:58.000 --> 06:59.000]  Ah!
[06:59.000 --> 07:00.000]  Ah!
[07:00.000 --> 07:01.000]  Talking about Alex Jones.
[07:01.000 --> 07:02.000]  Infowars.
[07:02.000 --> 07:03.000]  Alex Jones.
[07:03.000 --> 07:04.000]  Infowars.
[07:04.000 --> 07:05.000]  Alex Jones.
[07:05.000 --> 07:06.000]  Alex Jones.
[07:06.000 --> 07:07.000]  That's just level one.
[07:07.000 --> 07:08.000]  What's level two?
[07:08.000 --> 07:09.000]  I'll tell you.
[07:09.000 --> 07:20.000]  The animated contest of Liberty is waiting for you.
[07:20.000 --> 07:30.000]  If you've got to take it in your hands, you've got to have the will to accept the truth,
[07:30.000 --> 07:32.000]  fuck the system, and the group collect.
[07:32.000 --> 07:36.000]  Do that, and you'll learn your way to the next one.
[07:36.000 --> 07:51.000]  This is the Infowar.
[07:51.000 --> 08:03.000]  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're going to see some serious shit.
[08:03.000 --> 08:04.000]  And now, President Trump speaks.
[08:04.000 --> 08:05.000]  Thank you, Madison.
[08:05.000 --> 08:06.000]  Thank you.
[08:06.000 --> 08:07.000]  What a great guy.
[08:07.000 --> 08:09.000]  What a good future you've got.
[08:09.000 --> 08:11.000]  Where the hell is Madison?
[08:11.000 --> 08:13.000]  Thank you, Madison.
[08:13.000 --> 08:14.000]  Great job.
[08:14.000 --> 08:15.000]  Thank you very much.
[08:15.000 --> 08:17.000]  Have I had a face like him?
[08:17.000 --> 08:19.000]  I would have been President.
[08:19.000 --> 08:21.000]  Twenty years earlier.
[08:21.000 --> 08:23.000]  Twenty years earlier, Madison.
[08:23.000 --> 08:24.000]  Thank you very much.
[08:24.000 --> 08:25.000]  Great job.
[08:25.000 --> 08:26.000]  Thank you.
[08:26.000 --> 08:27.000]  Greg Murphy.
[08:27.000 --> 08:28.000]  Where's Greg?
[08:28.000 --> 08:29.000]  Where's Greg?
[08:29.000 --> 08:30.000]  Thank you, Greg.
[08:30.000 --> 08:31.000]  You're doing a really great job.
[08:31.000 --> 08:36.000]  We're proud of you.
[08:36.000 --> 08:37.000]  We're proud of you.
[08:37.000 --> 08:43.000]  And a friend of mine and somebody that's really been incredible, respected by everybody,
[08:43.000 --> 08:45.000]  Congressman Ted Budd.
[08:45.000 --> 08:47.000]  Where's Ted?
[08:47.000 --> 08:49.000]  Where's Ted?
[08:49.000 --> 08:51.000]  Good job, Ted.
[08:51.000 --> 08:53.000]  Good job.
[08:53.000 --> 08:56.000]  And here, as well, are two people that you may know of.
[08:56.000 --> 09:00.000]  Actually, I probably like her better.
[09:00.000 --> 09:02.000]  She was a supporter of mine before he was.
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.000]  People don't know that.
[09:04.000 --> 09:07.000]  Deb Meadows, stand up.
[09:07.000 --> 09:10.000]  Stand up, then.
[09:10.000 --> 09:13.000]  But we have to say, Deb, he wasn't far behind.
[09:13.000 --> 09:15.000]  It wasn't like, you know, many, many months.
[09:15.000 --> 09:19.000]  Now, he was, he had somebody else in mind, but he switched over very quickly.
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  I don't know if he had a choice right then.
[09:21.000 --> 09:23.000]  Mark Meadows, everybody.
[09:23.000 --> 09:29.000]  Real great guy.
[09:29.000 --> 09:35.000]  Now, with the spirit and energy and commitment of everyone in this room and the voters all across the state,
[09:35.000 --> 09:40.000]  2022 is going to be a banner year for North Carolina Republicans.
[09:40.000 --> 09:44.000]  You know, they said this state was, if you look back 10 years ago, Michael,
[09:44.000 --> 09:46.000]  they said this state was finished.
[09:46.000 --> 09:50.000]  It was not going to be a Republican state at all, and they had elected a governor,
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  and it really looked bad.
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.000]  And then these guys, some of them that I just announced, but others also,
[09:55.000 --> 09:59.000]  we all got together, and you've never been in a stronger position,
[09:59.000 --> 10:01.000]  and now you're going to have another senator.
[10:01.000 --> 10:07.000]  We just elected a wonderful friend of ours, and Tom is going to be great.
[10:07.000 --> 10:13.000]  I think Tom, he got off to a little rocky start with Protect Bob Mueller.
[10:13.000 --> 10:14.000]  But you know what?
[10:14.000 --> 10:19.000]  He flipped in the other direction totally, and he's been terrific,
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.000]  and he had a great race.
[10:21.000 --> 10:22.000]  He ran a great race.
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  He really did, and he had my total support.
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.000]  And he called me just a little while ago to tell me,
[10:28.000 --> 10:30.000]  enjoy the state, because I love the state.
[10:30.000 --> 10:31.000]  I love being in this state.
[10:31.000 --> 10:35.000]  But I just want to say that this was going to be a Democrat state,
[10:35.000 --> 10:41.000]  and here we are, and we're really dominating when you look at everything that's happened.
[10:41.000 --> 10:42.000]  So congratulations.
[10:42.000 --> 10:43.000]  It's really great.
[10:43.000 --> 10:48.000]  To you, to you guys.
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.000]  I think we're going to gain two or even three U.S. House seats.
[10:52.000 --> 10:53.000]  We're going to take over.
[10:53.000 --> 10:59.000]  If you look over the house, you're going to get rid of Nancy Pelosi.
[10:59.000 --> 11:03.000]  Remember, they stick together on an impeachment hoax.
[11:03.000 --> 11:06.000]  Not one Democrat, not one voted against.
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.000]  Well, actually, we had one that came over to our side,
[11:08.000 --> 11:11.000]  who was a terrific person, actually.
[11:11.000 --> 11:14.000]  But you take a look, and they didn't want to do that,
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  but they just do it a little bit differently.
[11:16.000 --> 11:21.000]  They play very tough, very dirty, and we just can't let it happen.
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  We're going to win North Carolina's all-important U.S. Senate race,
[11:25.000 --> 11:30.000]  and we're going to lay the groundwork for making sure that Republicans once again carry
[11:30.000 --> 11:39.000]  the great state of North Carolina in a number, a year that I look very much forward to, 2024.
[11:39.000 --> 11:45.000]  We're going to be numbers like you've never seen before.
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.000]  So many things are happening right now.
[11:47.000 --> 11:52.000]  But we're going to do things like you've never, ever seen before.
[11:52.000 --> 11:57.000]  I stand before you today confident that the people of North Carolina will
[11:57.000 --> 12:01.000]  decisively reject Joe Biden and the radical Democrats,
[12:01.000 --> 12:08.000]  the war on the American worker, the American family, and the American nation.
[12:08.000 --> 12:13.000]  And I have to tell you that I have a very special person.
[12:13.000 --> 12:18.000]  You know, she's been, I love my family. I love my family.
[12:18.000 --> 12:22.000]  And I happen to love this particular young man that she's married to.
[12:22.000 --> 12:25.000]  He's a very tall person.
[12:25.000 --> 12:31.000]  By the way, but not as tall as Baron.
[12:31.000 --> 12:34.000]  Baron is six-foot-seven.
[12:34.000 --> 12:38.000]  And he's 15.
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.000]  And Eric is short. He's only six-foot-six.
[12:42.000 --> 12:46.000]  But we love our Eric and we love them all. They're all great.
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.000]  And he is married to a very special woman, Laura.
[12:50.000 --> 12:54.000]  And I'd like to have her, you know, she was born in this particular state.
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.000]  She loves this particular state.
[12:56.000 --> 13:02.000]  And maybe I'd like to ask Laura Trump to come up and say a few words.
[13:02.000 --> 13:18.000]  Laura, please come on up.
[13:18.000 --> 13:26.000]  You know, this is just surreal that the current president of the United States is a puppet
[13:26.000 --> 13:32.000]  that stole his way into there.
[13:32.000 --> 13:42.000]  And then the real president of the United States has not been in front of a high-production, live studio audience
[13:42.000 --> 13:52.000]  since he was kicked out at its left of right-side broadcasting that looks like the camera iris has even set right
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  to be able to get footage of the president.
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  He's putting right-side broadcasting down.
[13:56.000 --> 14:00.000]  I know they operate on a shoestring budget.
[14:00.000 --> 14:08.000]  And it's just indicative of how much trouble we're in.
[14:08.000 --> 14:20.000]  And that skeleton, that Chai Khan agent, he's up there with all the slick production, everything.
[14:20.000 --> 14:26.000]  And I think that's better because you can just see the HD of him rotting in front of you and what a fraud he is.
[14:26.000 --> 14:34.000]  Now, I've been saying this a lot before the shows just because all I do is tell you how I feel that I'm having real trouble doing these broadcasts lately.
[14:34.000 --> 14:44.000]  And it's because of how this is really starting to set in on me that this is it.
[14:44.000 --> 14:48.000]  And they're really killing people all around us and making people all around us.
[14:48.000 --> 14:59.000]  And I was already ready today to come on here and look at the real numbers of the unprecedented amounts of young people having heart attacks,
[14:59.000 --> 15:03.000]  having strokes, even dying from the so-called COVID vaccines.
[15:03.000 --> 15:13.000]  And then I was sent a big Twitter feed by a good friend of mine, a national talk show host, about 30 months for the show.
[15:13.000 --> 15:19.000]  So I ended up reading this Twitter feed of medical documents and CDC numbers.
[15:19.000 --> 15:24.000]  And I actually got dizzy and almost passed out.
[15:24.000 --> 15:30.000]  You know, you have that effect where, quote, women would get overwhelmed by something and just pass out.
[15:30.000 --> 15:36.000]  And that's really the point I've gotten to where I'm just like, I mean, nothing's stopping any of this.
[15:36.000 --> 15:44.000]  Rolling forward, I was reading about hundreds of thousands of people getting sick from the shots that are young, how they're targeting our children.
[15:44.000 --> 15:46.000]  And it just pisses me off.
[15:46.000 --> 15:51.000]  And so my brain says, go out and, you know, do you know what people are doing this?
[15:51.000 --> 15:54.000]  I just, it's just overwhelming.
[15:54.000 --> 15:57.000]  It's just overwhelming to watch them kill us like this.
[15:57.000 --> 16:01.000]  Your voice counts.
[16:01.000 --> 16:06.000]  When you share information, be it over the Internet or in person, it changes the world.
[16:06.000 --> 16:09.000]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[16:09.000 --> 16:10.000]  They know you're angry.
[16:10.000 --> 16:16.000]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[17:09.000 --> 17:17.000]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, Super Male Vitality.
[17:17.000 --> 17:26.000]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[17:26.000 --> 17:37.000]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[17:37.000 --> 17:43.000]  Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[17:43.000 --> 17:50.000]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[17:50.000 --> 17:55.000]  So what are you waiting for? Go to the Info Wars store. Never been a better time than right now.
[17:55.000 --> 18:00.000]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[18:00.000 --> 18:03.000]  I'm a very humble person but I'm also a bold person.
[18:03.000 --> 18:08.000]  And so as bad as things are with the globalist and tagging humanity with all the terrible things that are unfolding,
[18:08.000 --> 18:13.000]  I want you to know that a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[18:13.000 --> 18:17.000]  I'm a public figure so I get to see things that the Republic doesn't get to see.
[18:17.000 --> 18:25.000]  And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry,
[18:25.000 --> 18:29.000]  people are really, really awake in the establishment.
[18:29.000 --> 18:34.000]  They don't want to go along with the globalists but they're scared, they're looking for leadership.
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.000]  Well, that's where InfoWars comes in.
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.000]  You fund us, you support InfoWarsStore.com, you get rape proxies at the same time.
[18:40.000 --> 18:44.000]  We will then go out and do what the globalist says unpopular,
[18:44.000 --> 18:50.000]  what the globalist will target you for to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[18:50.000 --> 18:55.000]  That's our job so please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire,
[18:55.000 --> 18:58.000]  so we can be the shock groups in the information war.
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  InfoWarsStore.com
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.000]  No show.
[19:34.000 --> 19:41.000]  You know, I know my brain is lealing and that I'm kind of in a constant reset mode
[19:41.000 --> 19:50.000]  because there's an answer that I'm supposed to come up with, that you're supposed to come up with to counter this.
[19:50.000 --> 19:55.000]  This unprecedented criminal takeover, I mean the quickening is here.
[19:55.000 --> 20:03.000]  And that's really the issue. 20 years ago, out of 100 articles or so, there might be one really big one.
[20:03.000 --> 20:13.000]  I have more than 50 devastating reports that are confirmed that send chills up my spine.
[20:13.000 --> 20:18.000]  And it's just, it's the real realization of how screwed we are.
[20:18.000 --> 20:25.000]  It'd be like if I walked outside and looked up at the sun and saw it like explode and I'd go oh my gosh,
[20:25.000 --> 20:28.000]  that explosion is going to get here in just a few minutes, we're all dead.
[20:28.000 --> 20:33.000]  It feels something kind of like that. It's like the ooh, wow.
[20:33.000 --> 20:40.000]  Because they have set something in motion that is the planned organized total collapse of civilization and mass death.
[20:40.000 --> 20:46.000]  And that's why they don't care that they're killing hundreds of millions right now that have been injected,
[20:46.000 --> 20:50.000]  that are the walking dead, that are dead already.
[20:50.000 --> 20:56.000]  Because by the time those people are dying, there'll be so many calamities, so much collapse that it won't matter anymore.
[20:56.000 --> 20:59.000]  It's the end of civilization.
[20:59.000 --> 21:06.000]  And it's not even a selfishness, but my very cells say get out of Austin, get your family out,
[21:06.000 --> 21:10.000]  and go to the most remote area and dig in now.
[21:10.000 --> 21:19.000]  But if we do that, the globalists win and they're going to accelerate their collapse and finally dig us out of our holes later.
[21:19.000 --> 21:29.000]  Every movie, every show is now coming out with dystopic mass death, planetary extermination, robots killing us under U in command
[21:29.000 --> 21:35.000]  because they're preconditioning everyone to accept that and that that is the future that's about to unfold.
[21:35.000 --> 21:40.000]  And I mean, the video games, the movies, all of it.
[21:40.000 --> 21:45.000]  This is the genetic engineering mad scientist revolution.
[21:45.000 --> 21:51.000]  You see, we fought Hitler in World War II, the Soviet Union, the Cold War, and, you know, we got China as this big enemy,
[21:51.000 --> 21:58.000]  but it's really the mad scientist laboratory.
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  Yeah, here's some over TV viewers.
[22:00.000 --> 22:02.000]  I mean, this gets really bad.
[22:02.000 --> 22:07.000]  Robots invading the U.S. U.N. slaughtering everybody because of climate change.
[22:07.000 --> 22:11.000]  Climate change is just the excuse for total collapse.
[22:11.000 --> 22:14.000]  All the globalists are actually collapsing things.
[22:14.000 --> 22:20.000]  So I'm going to be laying all of that out today as well.
[22:20.000 --> 22:31.000]  But this is not a deer in the headlights moment.
[22:31.000 --> 22:38.000]  It's almost obscene to even tell everybody this.
[22:38.000 --> 22:43.000]  It's kind of like they put a blindfold on somebody who's in a firing squad.
[22:43.000 --> 22:48.000]  So they have to watch themselves be killed.
[22:48.000 --> 22:56.000]  And they give you a cigarette, maybe a little bottle of brandy an hour before.
[22:56.000 --> 23:01.000]  So, you know what, the public's not going to wake up and stop this anyways.
[23:01.000 --> 23:02.000]  They don't want to.
[23:02.000 --> 23:03.000]  We're cursed.
[23:03.000 --> 23:04.000]  We kill our babies.
[23:04.000 --> 23:06.000]  We kill our old people.
[23:06.000 --> 23:14.000]  And so I guess, I just guess, prepared everything collapsed and destroyed and to die.
[23:14.000 --> 23:17.000]  I mean, I guess that's just really it.
[23:17.000 --> 23:19.000]  I mean, that's the wages of sin.
[23:19.000 --> 23:21.000]  That's Satanism.
[23:21.000 --> 23:24.000]  And so that's who we are.
[23:24.000 --> 23:28.000]  I have all the battle plans that they now admit the global lockdown is never going to end.
[23:28.000 --> 23:34.000]  As we said, they're just loosening it up in areas that would resist.
[23:34.000 --> 23:38.000]  So when they finally clamp down again, you think, oh, it's just for a little while.
[23:38.000 --> 23:42.000]  It's all psychological warfare.
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.000]  Mike Lindell is going to be joining us.
[23:44.000 --> 23:49.000]  You can say what you want about Mike, but he's an American entrepreneur and he saw election fraud and he's had a lot of courage.
[23:49.000 --> 23:51.000]  He's really a hero.
[23:51.000 --> 23:53.000]  He's going to be joining us coming up next hour.
[23:53.000 --> 24:01.000]  He's getting off an airplane here about 15 minutes.
[24:01.000 --> 24:04.000]  Here's what I'm trying to get at.
[24:04.000 --> 24:21.000]  If we don't really respond and really get upset and really recognize the globalist carrying out this control collapse of the world, then doom is where we're going.
[24:21.000 --> 24:30.000]  Because this mad scientist evil, this post-humanist evil, has figured out all the angles.
[24:30.000 --> 24:38.000]  And the only way you beat it is recognizing the angles and its full spectrum assault and then do the exact opposite.
[24:38.000 --> 24:46.000]  But instead, the public likes to debate and argue and act silly and fight with each other at the low level.
[24:46.000 --> 24:49.000]  And if you do that, we have zero chance.
[24:49.000 --> 25:05.000]  If we just woke up and accepted God and did what God said to do and stood against the New World Order, then this evil would just evaporate like phantoms had gone.
[25:05.000 --> 25:09.000]  Everybody can feel it.
[25:09.000 --> 25:14.000]  Everybody can see it.
[25:14.000 --> 25:19.000]  That's just what it comes down to.
[25:19.000 --> 25:25.000]  So here's what I'm going to do.
[25:25.000 --> 25:32.000]  I'm going to make sure we stay on air as long as we can and make sure that's built within our own houses in order.
[25:32.000 --> 25:35.000]  And then I'm going to come back and I'm going to hit all this finish.
[25:35.000 --> 25:43.000]  As fast as I can, I'm just going to cover it and that's going to be it.
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  But I also, the crew does a great job.
[25:45.000 --> 25:56.000]  But maybe next few segments, you can't put stuff on screen because I'm here talking and they just put a screen clip up of people in New York saying we want to wear masks forever.
[25:56.000 --> 25:57.000]  We don't want to take them off.
[25:57.000 --> 25:58.000]  We like them.
[25:58.000 --> 26:03.000]  They're our blankets.
[26:03.000 --> 26:04.000]  And that's just something I was going to cover later.
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.000]  But see, that's painful to look at.
[26:08.000 --> 26:11.000]  And so I'm right on the edge of just not being able to handle this anymore.
[26:11.000 --> 26:17.000]  Plus, it then just becomes a distraction from what I'm already covering, what I'm doing.
[26:17.000 --> 26:18.000]  And I'm not bitching at the crew.
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.000]  I told them to put stuff up on screen.
[26:20.000 --> 26:27.000]  It's just this point, I may have to start doing the show in a radio booth and the crew can go run other shows or something.
[26:27.000 --> 26:32.000]  And I'm just going to go back to reading articles and covering those because I can't look at Joe Biden.
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  I can't look at the mass cult.
[26:34.000 --> 26:36.000]  I can't look at another animal, human clone.
[26:36.000 --> 26:50.000]  I just want away from these Satanists, God Almighty.
[26:50.000 --> 27:05.000]  You know, the worst thing is reading all these federal documents and how they know by design that they're giving the young people shots now that are going to mess up their hearts, livers and brains and lungs for life, which is not going to be very long.
[27:05.000 --> 27:14.000]  And then of course, I knew this a while ago while they're doing it.
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.000]  Not just about killing you.
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.000]  It's a sacrifice of the youth and that pleases their God.
[27:22.000 --> 27:31.000]  And also it's going to weigh down and hurt their families and cause great anguish in their families because you're supposed to bury your parents, not bury your children.
[27:31.000 --> 27:38.000]  And also it's designed to collapse society while they suck all the money out of the families that are going to try to keep their family members alive.
[27:38.000 --> 27:44.000]  It'll take a good 10 painful years for more people to take these injections to die.
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  And so I just, I can't believe that actually did it.
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.000]  Bill Gates said he would do it and they've done it.
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  And I think it's a pretty normal response.
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.000]  I can barely do the show right now because I mean, this is sick.
[27:53.000 --> 27:54.000]  This is sick.
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.000]  Everybody just better get that through their head.
[27:56.000 --> 27:58.000]  This is, this is it folks.
[27:58.000 --> 28:05.000]  Big Pharma was born out of the Rockefeller oil industry in 1900 with the petrochemical.
[28:05.000 --> 28:11.000]  The petrochemical then dominated two major industries, plastics and drugs.
[28:11.000 --> 28:16.000]  Companies began synthesizing patented versions of naturally sourced drugs.
[28:16.000 --> 28:19.000]  The natural sources were then made illegal.
[28:19.000 --> 28:22.000]  Pharmaceuticals became medicine.
[28:22.000 --> 28:25.000]  And the sicker people got, the more their industry grew.
[28:25.000 --> 28:29.000]  It's a death cult and it's up to the individual to escape.
[28:29.000 --> 28:35.000]  Good health begins with a healthy immune system, which needs the proper nutrients to thrive.
[28:35.000 --> 28:39.000]  Nutrients we cannot readily get from our food today.
[28:39.000 --> 28:48.000]  The combinations of vitamin C and zinc and vitamin D3 with calcium have been proven to be what we need to maintain a healthy immune system.
[28:48.000 --> 28:55.000]  Go to inforstore.com and start supporting your natural immune system now with the mega immune support pack.
[28:55.000 --> 29:19.000]  Now 40% off.
[29:25.000 --> 29:30.000]  So many people want to be positive.
[29:30.000 --> 29:35.000]  They want to put out fake news and want to only cover limited amounts of what's happening with new world order.
[29:35.000 --> 29:38.000]  But at the end of the day, it's all about the population.
[29:38.000 --> 29:39.000]  It's all about world government.
[29:39.000 --> 29:42.000]  It's all about the end of the human system as we know it.
[29:42.000 --> 29:44.000]  And on its ashes, a nightmare.
[29:44.000 --> 29:55.000]  I'm not going to say this five times in a row to be obnoxious.
[29:55.000 --> 29:58.000]  I'm saying it because it's the key to victory over these criminals.
[29:58.000 --> 30:07.000]  Last week, the arch-globalist Fauci admitted that roughly half of the CDC's top brass and workers,
[30:07.000 --> 30:16.000]  medical doctors, scientists, nurses, you name it, have taken the so-called COVID-19 franken shot.
[30:16.000 --> 30:18.000]  I'm going to say it the second time.
[30:18.000 --> 30:26.000]  Around half of the doctors at the CDC and NIH refused to take the franken shots.
[30:26.000 --> 30:27.000]  They don't trust it.
[30:27.000 --> 30:29.000]  You shouldn't trust it.
[30:29.000 --> 30:32.000]  The vaccines have been banned in most countries around the world.
[30:32.000 --> 30:38.000]  This is an attack on the American people and the people of the world.
[30:38.000 --> 30:42.000]  This is an absolute red flag smoking gun.
[30:42.000 --> 30:44.000]  Again, let me say it two more times.
[30:44.000 --> 30:48.000]  Around half of the individuals that work at the NIH and the CDC,
[30:48.000 --> 30:50.000]  the medical staff refused to take the vaccines.
[30:50.000 --> 30:51.000]  That's right.
[30:51.000 --> 30:55.000]  The doctors, nurses, scientists do not trust a so-called vaccine.
[30:55.000 --> 30:56.000]  You shouldn't either.
[30:56.000 --> 31:01.000]  You should warn everyone you know about the truth.
[31:01.000 --> 31:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:23.000 --> 31:26.000]  All right, my friends, I don't want to say welcome back.
[31:26.000 --> 31:27.000]  I mean, we're awake.
[31:27.000 --> 31:28.000]  We're informed.
[31:28.000 --> 31:34.000]  We're looking at this giant globalist chemical biological attack taking place.
[31:34.000 --> 31:40.000]  And at a certain point it's just not normal to set up here like this is a normal show.
[31:40.000 --> 31:45.000]  And just say, oh, you know, billions of people are being injected with a chemical bio-weapon
[31:45.000 --> 31:49.000]  that's going to slowly kill them that they're designed to collapse industrial society
[31:49.000 --> 31:51.000]  because we're taking care of so many sick people.
[31:51.000 --> 31:56.000]  And the system thinks it's got a plan to manage that and be able to gaslight the public
[31:56.000 --> 32:02.000]  to not make sure that Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and Anthony Fauci and the rest of them
[32:02.000 --> 32:05.000]  get sent to Supermax presence for it.
[32:05.000 --> 32:07.000]  Because they're the institutional controllers.
[32:07.000 --> 32:09.000]  They control the stolen trillions.
[32:09.000 --> 32:17.000]  They control big tech with Mark Zuckerberg who's hanging out on this stolen land in Kauai, Hawaii.
[32:17.000 --> 32:22.000]  But we're all living under ongoing martial law.
[32:22.000 --> 32:31.000]  And then I just see the public mesmerized into a trance watching their sports and playing their video games.
[32:31.000 --> 32:37.000]  And I can't join the globalist because that's evil and I don't want to prey on people.
[32:37.000 --> 32:45.000]  And then most of the public came to understand what I'm saying.
[32:45.000 --> 32:50.000]  I guess we're just here to tell the truth and let people make a decision for themselves.
[32:50.000 --> 32:52.000]  It'll all work out in God's plan.
[32:52.000 --> 32:59.000]  But I feel like I'm getting punched in the chest right now.
[32:59.000 --> 33:03.000]  And I don't know what it is I'm supposed to do to not feel like that.
[33:03.000 --> 33:05.000]  I normally feel good about everything I'm doing.
[33:05.000 --> 33:09.000]  And almost always when I feel like this, it means there's some answer.
[33:09.000 --> 33:13.000]  There's something we're supposed to do right now that will stop this.
[33:13.000 --> 33:14.000]  And I guess that's what it is.
[33:14.000 --> 33:16.000]  I feel extreme guilt.
[33:16.000 --> 33:19.000]  And I'm not someone in my life that feels a lot of guilt.
[33:19.000 --> 33:27.000]  And I know that that's why I may have to go off air today because I don't want to just sit up here and talk about how I feel.
[33:27.000 --> 33:30.000]  This isn't some calculated thing before I came in today to say all this.
[33:30.000 --> 33:40.000]  I have stacks of government documents, stacks of reports that are all total nightmares, all 10 on a Richter scale of tyranny.
[33:40.000 --> 33:49.000]  It's like Judge Joe Brown is a really famous criminal judge that did some of the biggest cases in the country.
[33:49.000 --> 33:52.000]  I didn't even know that until I got to know him and looked him up.
[33:52.000 --> 33:55.000]  I said he was a TV judge and he was a judge.
[33:55.000 --> 34:04.000]  And when he saw that former deputy director of the FBI say we're going to arrest members of Congress for their speech and we're going to take over,
[34:04.000 --> 34:06.000]  he was taken back and freaked out the whole time.
[34:06.000 --> 34:11.000]  And after the show, he was freaked out like I was and we were sitting there freaked out by it.
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  Well, that's because he's got his head screwed on.
[34:13.000 --> 34:14.000]  He understands history.
[34:14.000 --> 34:26.000]  He understands that's really dangerous and that means they're coming for everybody and that we're in deep trouble.
[34:26.000 --> 34:28.000]  And so he didn't even know about that.
[34:28.000 --> 34:32.000]  He couldn't believe he spent all the different breaks searching on his phone.
[34:32.000 --> 34:39.000]  He was good at searching for stuff about that FBI agent because he couldn't believe it was not a big story that they said that.
[34:39.000 --> 34:46.000]  And I said, your honor, I can play you a 20 minute excerpt video of a bunch of other ones saying that all over TV.
[34:46.000 --> 34:49.000]  He's like, yeah, I don't watch much of that table news.
[34:49.000 --> 34:50.000]  I didn't see that.
[34:50.000 --> 34:56.000]  So I showed him some more back there after we off air for lunch before he flew out and he was just really upset.
[34:56.000 --> 34:58.000]  And that's normal, ladies and gentlemen.
[34:58.000 --> 35:04.000]  I mean, we're supposed to be upset.
[35:04.000 --> 35:10.000]  All right.
[35:10.000 --> 35:13.000]  Here's another problem.
[35:13.000 --> 35:20.000]  If I just sit here and read these article headlines out and don't dig into each one, it doesn't have any effect.
[35:20.000 --> 35:35.000]  People need to know what's really happening here.
[35:35.000 --> 35:43.000]  Take this article right here.
[35:43.000 --> 35:48.000]  That's an ode to Rush Limbaugh.
[35:48.000 --> 35:59.000]  The story in and of itself would be a top story for two years and thousands of people will go to jail.
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.000]  But see, we're in a route right now.
[36:01.000 --> 36:03.000]  We're going to collapse right now.
[36:03.000 --> 36:09.000]  So if you think this is bad, can you imagine what else is going on?
[36:09.000 --> 36:14.000]  The shutdown, the lockdown is to destroy the regular economy and to consolidate it.
[36:14.000 --> 36:20.000]  And the printing of the money is the looting of the economy and it's not supposed to go to the citizens.
[36:20.000 --> 36:29.000]  It goes to the insiders for all those weeks that everybody I knew was trying to get on when they were told to go get their stimulus money
[36:29.000 --> 36:32.000]  or go get their federal unemployment money.
[36:32.000 --> 36:35.000]  And most of you never could get it.
[36:35.000 --> 36:39.000]  You just moved in with your parents or your neighbors and got some odd jobs.
[36:39.000 --> 36:44.000]  That's because over half the money was siphoned off by hackers.
[36:44.000 --> 36:46.000]  That's the globalist.
[36:46.000 --> 36:49.000]  That's the legion of doom to China and others.
[36:49.000 --> 36:52.000]  And here it is out of Axios.
[36:52.000 --> 36:54.000]  And I said this back at the time.
[36:54.000 --> 37:00.000]  Half of the pandemic's unemployment money may have been stolen.
[37:00.000 --> 37:08.000]  Criminals may have stolen as much as half over that of the unemployment benefits of the US and have been pumping out over the past year.
[37:08.000 --> 37:10.000]  Why it matters.
[37:10.000 --> 37:14.000]  Unemployment fraud during the pandemic could easily reach 400 billion according to estimates.
[37:14.000 --> 37:19.000]  And the bulk of the money likely ended up in the hands of foreign crime syndicates.
[37:19.000 --> 37:23.000]  Making this not just theft, but a matter of national security.
[37:23.000 --> 37:30.000]  Well, the Democrats shut off our pipelines and ship fentanyl in and tell us that the country shouldn't exist.
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  So, I mean, they tell you who they are.
[37:32.000 --> 37:39.000]  They're the ones doing the pipeline shutdowns. They're the ones doing the ransomware. It's that deep state cabal.
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.000]  But that's all any of this is.
[37:41.000 --> 38:00.000]  And then when one out of three people's got a neurological disorder or a heart condition and all these new mystery heart conditions and mystery mystery brain conditions and mystery lung conditions and mystery cardiovascular conditions in people that have been quote vaccinated for COVID-19.
[38:00.000 --> 38:07.000]  And then they'll set up the panels to find out what did it run by people that did it and they'll siphon all those trillions into themselves.
[38:07.000 --> 38:16.000]  And we'll be sitting here in a year or two with, you know, run 10 K to raise money because, you know, all the neurological problems and they'll have movie stars up there.
[38:16.000 --> 38:17.000]  Well, let's get together.
[38:17.000 --> 38:28.000]  And finally, at a certain point, 10 years down the road, or even sooner, they'll say, well, folks are signing on to volunteer to be euthanized because they know they're too much of a weight on society.
[38:28.000 --> 38:35.000]  And they'll get some extra money and get to party for a few weeks before they are killed.
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  And that's all the plan here.
[38:37.000 --> 38:44.000]  And just like I told you about animal human clones and all the rest of it will be sitting here, probably not on air then, but you'll be watching it.
[38:44.000 --> 38:47.000]  And if you say anything about it, you'll be arrested.
[38:47.000 --> 38:51.000]  So that's all any of this is.
[38:51.000 --> 38:53.000]  So I mean, I've seen the whole plan.
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  I've read the whole plan and they're going ahead with it.
[38:55.000 --> 38:59.000]  I mean, I guess that's really for me.
[38:59.000 --> 39:04.000]  I'm not a wimp, but I mean, I'm pretty shook up right now because I theoretically knew all this.
[39:04.000 --> 39:09.000]  I knew they tested it out on small groups and my God injected black people with several of us.
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  All the rest of it and radiated foster kids to death.
[39:11.000 --> 39:21.000]  And I mean, you know, all the stuff this pulse done, but now they've built it up incrementally where they got the whole system working for them now.
[39:21.000 --> 39:28.000]  The system, the banks, the insurance companies, the AI systems and then now nurses and doctors and people are learning.
[39:28.000 --> 39:34.000]  They're just like attendance that are just there overseeing the system that's automated.
[39:34.000 --> 39:41.000]  They're just there like a ceremonial pilot in the future when all aircraft are drone, which is basically already what they are.
[39:41.000 --> 39:49.000]  The pilot just is like a concierge that talks to human passengers and maybe pours them a cup of coffee because a robot's flying the plane.
[39:49.000 --> 39:52.000]  It's the same thing now with hospitals and everything.
[39:52.000 --> 39:59.000]  They're just concierge there more and more inviting you into their robot system that the globalist program.
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  They're like, well, I'll trust a robot.
[40:01.000 --> 40:02.000]  Oh, really?
[40:02.000 --> 40:05.000]  Did you program that robot?
[40:05.000 --> 40:11.000]  So this is in the day stuff and your church isn't going to say a word.
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  They just want to party.
[40:13.000 --> 40:18.000]  They just want to have a good time.
[40:18.000 --> 40:24.000]  Hell, you're not going to find more satanic group of people than the folks that run the churches.
[40:24.000 --> 40:29.000]  Because they're the real betrayers that whether to make sure there wouldn't be a church to fight this when it was needed.
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  So I'm sorry, folks.
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  I'm real sorry.
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  And I'm not trying to depress you.
[40:35.000 --> 40:39.000]  It means God's plan is real and we're being judged, but this is going to be rough.
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.000]  I've got all the numbers right here.
[40:41.000 --> 40:47.000]  They are right now basically lobotomizing billions of people with these injections.
[40:47.000 --> 40:49.000]  You're like, well, they're dumb.
[40:49.000 --> 40:50.000]  Let them get sick.
[40:50.000 --> 40:51.000]  They shouldn't have taken it.
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  Well, you're going to have to take care of these people.
[40:53.000 --> 40:57.000]  They're collapsed going to bring us all down.
[40:57.000 --> 41:05.000]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[41:05.000 --> 41:10.000]  The globalists are out of the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[41:10.000 --> 41:18.000]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[41:18.000 --> 41:19.000]  Humanity is strong.
[41:19.000 --> 41:20.000]  We're incredible.
[41:20.000 --> 41:24.000]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.000]  So prayer is essential.
[41:28.000 --> 41:29.000]  Research is essential.
[41:29.000 --> 41:30.000]  Getting prepared is essential.
[41:30.000 --> 41:33.000]  And warning others is absolutely essential.
[41:33.000 --> 41:43.000]  And at the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high-quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family and they're also funding our operation.

[41:55.000 --> 41:58.000]  And I thank you for being part of the Resistance.
[41:59.000 --> 42:02.000]  What are champions made of?
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  Here's a man who can show you.
[42:32.000 --> 43:00.000]  InfoWarsStore. com
[43:00.000 --> 43:04.960]  The entire new will-builder system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel
[43:04.960 --> 43:09.560]  weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being
[43:09.560 --> 43:15.400]  made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[43:15.400 --> 43:21.480]  Being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[43:21.480 --> 43:23.480]  an entire system.
[43:23.480 --> 43:26.560]  And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're able to see
[43:26.560 --> 43:30.920]  the beauty of the sunset or the beauty of the waves in the ocean or the beauty of your
[43:30.920 --> 43:35.880]  life or your husband or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music,
[43:35.880 --> 43:40.800]  the fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic and that itself
[43:40.800 --> 43:43.640]  is what God teaches us is worship.
[43:43.640 --> 43:48.240]  So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things in
[43:48.240 --> 43:54.120]  the system but worship the things of God because we're made by God and appreciate your consciousness
[43:54.120 --> 43:58.680]  and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[43:58.680 --> 44:03.960]  The bio-pros are the new non-GMO pollution solution using eco-friendly products to treat
[44:03.960 --> 44:06.000]  everyday problems while supporting our environment.

[45:01.640 --> 45:19.320]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[45:19.320 --> 45:47.000]  If you grew up next to a con artist and you watched him get arrested the first time, the
[45:47.000 --> 45:52.320]  second time, the fourth time, the tenth time, you would know not to do business with that
[45:52.320 --> 45:53.320]  person.
[45:53.320 --> 45:55.760]  You'd know not to leave your wallet laying out on top of the counter around them.
[45:55.760 --> 45:57.200]  You'd know not to have them in your house.
[45:57.200 --> 46:02.640]  In fact, you'd probably move away from them if they got out of the penitentiary and moved
[46:02.640 --> 46:04.440]  back into your next door.
[46:04.440 --> 46:09.880]  So, see, you could keep treating that con artist every day like they were a new person
[46:09.880 --> 46:11.520]  and give them the benefit of the doubt.
[46:11.520 --> 46:14.320]  That's called being a fool.
[46:14.320 --> 46:20.800]  Remember, you just don't trust or follow any damn thing they say.
[46:20.800 --> 46:25.120]  And that's where we're at with the mainstream media and the Democratic Party and the globalists
[46:25.120 --> 46:31.200]  and the left and the universities and Big Pharma and all of them have huge, giant histories
[46:31.200 --> 46:36.560]  of corruption and control and greediness and lies.
[46:36.560 --> 46:41.120]  And they're using high-tech psychology to control everybody, and so the only way to
[46:41.120 --> 46:47.720]  beat them is to reject everything they say and everything they do and not buy a damn
[46:47.720 --> 46:51.880]  word comes out of their mouth and to shun them.
[46:51.880 --> 46:52.880]  Don't bully them.
[46:52.880 --> 46:54.960]  Just say, I'm not going to be around you.
[46:54.960 --> 46:58.560]  I'm not going to pay for my young person to go to your stupid college.
[46:58.560 --> 47:00.880]  I'm not going to go to your corporate media event.
[47:00.880 --> 47:04.280]  I'm not going to support your rock concert, your football game.
[47:04.280 --> 47:07.280]  We have to come out of Babylon.
[47:07.280 --> 47:13.600]  And when I say that, I'm right here in the middle of it, and I like to go out to nights
[47:13.600 --> 47:17.320]  at restaurants, and I like to ride around on a boat on the lake, and I like to fly around
[47:17.320 --> 47:19.480]  in these airplanes, and I like to sit there.
[47:19.480 --> 47:26.160]  But all of that is spider web that captures you for the spider.
[47:26.160 --> 47:31.240]  All of that's the modern trappings of Babylon, and it itself isn't evil, but it's been set
[47:31.240 --> 47:32.840]  up to trap you.
[47:32.840 --> 47:37.920]  I was thinking about this last night, and that's why I was frustrated the last 15 minutes
[47:37.920 --> 47:44.800]  on here, and now it all hit me, is we ask ourselves, why did people stay in Nazi Germany
[47:44.800 --> 47:51.000]  up until 1940 when Hitler then started arresting basically everybody?
[47:51.000 --> 47:52.120]  They saw him come in.
[47:52.120 --> 47:55.640]  They saw him arrest hundreds of thousands and kill hundreds of thousands, and then arrest
[47:55.640 --> 47:59.800]  millions and take people's speech and do everything the globalists are doing right now.
[47:59.800 --> 48:04.360]  But people that were upper middle class and wealthy were left alone, and they just kept
[48:04.360 --> 48:07.840]  thinking, well, I'll be left alone.
[48:07.840 --> 48:18.720]  Hell, lots of top Nazis ended up getting targeted because Hitler was jealous of them, or they
[48:18.720 --> 48:19.720]  wanted their money.
[48:19.720 --> 48:25.760]  And in the end, all the Nazis did was get rid of their own safety net, their own protection
[48:25.760 --> 48:29.120]  system, and got destroyed.
[48:29.120 --> 48:36.120]  The same thing with the Russians and the same thing with the Chinese, everybody else.
[48:36.120 --> 48:40.120]  I was reading about some of the Rothschilds that actually got picked up and killed by
[48:40.120 --> 48:41.120]  Hitler.
[48:41.120 --> 48:45.640]  They thought they were so rich, I saw one of the Rothschilds on PBS years ago, because
[48:45.640 --> 48:48.520]  she'd gotten out of the country, she was a little girl, but her parents didn't die.
[48:48.520 --> 48:50.480]  They thought they could buy Hitler off.
[48:50.480 --> 48:53.680]  They thought, well, we're so rich and powerful, we're not going to leave France, we're not
[48:53.680 --> 48:56.760]  going to leave our state, we'll just give the Nazis most of our money and they'll leave
[48:56.760 --> 48:57.760]  us alone.
[48:57.760 --> 48:59.560]  Hitler killed both of them.
[48:59.560 --> 49:05.120]  And that's the whole point is, everybody pretending at Google and Facebook and Twitter
[49:05.120 --> 49:12.600]  and IBM and the New York Times and CNN, pretending like you're safe, screwing everybody else
[49:12.600 --> 49:17.520]  over, and going along with this plan, because you better damn well believe don't have the
[49:17.520 --> 49:23.040]  emergency on the shots, you think something this evil isn't going to get you, you think
[49:23.040 --> 49:29.920]  I'm feeding this beast now, we'll make it kiss your hand, it's going to destroy you
[49:29.920 --> 49:32.400]  and your fools.
[49:32.400 --> 49:39.440]  You don't join with Satan and become the boss, you get eaten.
[49:39.440 --> 49:43.160]  So here's what sent me for a tell spin, because I already knew all this, but it kind of all
[49:43.160 --> 49:52.160]  crystallized 10 minutes before the show.
[49:52.160 --> 50:00.920]  And then there's some things I want to tell you, and I can't tell you because of the sources
[50:00.920 --> 50:06.480]  they told me not to, and I've never blown a source and I've never given information
[50:06.480 --> 50:07.480]  out.
[50:07.480 --> 50:11.400]  And sometimes there's information you can't get out because if you give out any of it,
[50:11.400 --> 50:14.800]  it gives it away from the source before they finish the work they're doing, but there's
[50:14.800 --> 50:21.000]  a major counter strike to all this in the works right now, but it's been confirmed the documents
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.240]  have been seen that this is a kill plan.
[50:23.240 --> 50:27.400]  They've got a whole societal collapse program, how it brings down the hospitals and brings
[50:27.400 --> 50:32.440]  down the civilization, then there's a collapse, then we accept mass death, and then we accept
[50:32.440 --> 50:37.240]  basically a worldwide AI takeover and they claim that only an AI system can manage all
[50:37.240 --> 50:41.080]  this because so many humans are sick and dying, not just the baby boomer generation that's
[50:41.080 --> 50:47.240]  got to be taken care of, and then a whole robot rollout comes out, and then the general masses
[50:47.240 --> 50:51.920]  are starving to death, and so those that still have wealth that aren't part of the system
[50:51.920 --> 50:56.480]  are told, you've got to sign on and put your wealth into this to stabilize and save all
[50:56.480 --> 51:00.400]  these people that are dying and starving, and then basically you sign your wealth over
[51:00.400 --> 51:07.200]  to this big giant global wallet that they're going to be rolling out, and this global wallet
[51:07.200 --> 51:10.200]  will have your medical ID, everything on it, and of course we already knew all that, the
[51:10.200 --> 51:15.680]  Australian leader just came out and announced it yesterday that your COVID pass will now
[51:15.680 --> 51:23.880]  be your money, but I've been talking to folks that have seen the official government plans
[51:23.880 --> 51:32.360]  put out by the major foundations, the Carnegie Endowment, that's why the Carnegie Endowment
[51:32.360 --> 51:37.160]  is now in full control, Bill Gates works for them, the CIA is run by the Carnegie Endowment,
[51:37.160 --> 51:41.600]  and it's just a total extermination plan, I mean final solution, we're all dead, it's
[51:41.600 --> 51:49.400]  like wow, wow, you guys are really evil, because I knew they were evil, but man, it's bad enough
[51:49.400 --> 51:53.960]  wanting to wipe out third world people, and I don't want to kill them, but I know that
[51:53.960 --> 51:58.440]  they don't have jobs, futures, any of that, I'm not signed on to kill them, but this plan
[51:58.440 --> 52:06.880]  is to kill everybody, so, I mean I see I've just got stuff like that going on, and I don't
[52:06.880 --> 52:12.080]  just believe people that have seen the documents, I can see the documents all in front of me
[52:12.080 --> 52:17.560]  how they're implementing it, everything I was told by the individual that saw this plan,
[52:17.560 --> 52:23.720]  and it held, the plan is in event 201, the plan is in lockstep, the plan is in crimson
[52:23.720 --> 52:31.440]  contagion, the plan is all there, but specifically they've reached the point now of recruiting
[52:31.440 --> 52:37.200]  levels deep into government corporations and have gone operational now, so they're even
[52:37.200 --> 52:42.200]  telling people the plan to get them on board, hey like, you know, you and your family are
[52:42.200 --> 52:48.600]  going to live, if you want to be part of that 500 million that live, some of the Georgia
[52:48.600 --> 52:53.880]  Guidestones, you better get on board right now, and you'll get up space for your family
[52:53.880 --> 52:58.320]  during the collapse, but of course you read deeper, and this is what these individuals
[52:58.320 --> 53:03.040]  were able to see, it's exactly what they've told us, that they believe all humans must
[53:03.040 --> 53:07.120]  be gotten rid of, and above that there's not much knowledge, but everybody including
[53:07.120 --> 53:11.360]  top pentagon, four star generals, they think it's aliens, some deal's been made with aliens
[53:11.360 --> 53:15.480]  to kill everybody, and then the people, the small group that does it gets to like, like
[53:15.480 --> 53:19.920]  the Borg or whatever, join these things, man all I'm telling you is, is that everybody's
[53:19.920 --> 53:25.160]  dead, that's all I can tell you, and so I can't even fight with CNN, I can't even fight
[53:25.160 --> 53:29.680]  with the New York Times or lawyers suing me, like a lawyer suing me when there's a plan
[53:29.680 --> 53:33.440]  to kill everybody, it's like, what does that do to me, I mean, you know, it's like, and
[53:33.440 --> 53:41.200]  I'm sitting here on air talking about this, it's all real, and then I've known all this
[53:41.200 --> 53:44.600]  stuff for months, I already knew it all, it's the only reason I got told it, and I'm sitting
[53:44.600 --> 53:52.000]  here and I just cannot believe all this, I cannot believe we've gotten to this point,
[53:52.000 --> 53:55.840]  so do I know there's aliens calling the shots, no, everybody else I've talked to goes, yeah,
[53:55.840 --> 54:01.800]  we think you're right, this doesn't make any sense, because they're not just going to kill
[54:01.800 --> 54:05.400]  people down to 500 million, which is the official UN number, they're planning to kill all those
[54:05.400 --> 54:17.000]  people too.
[54:17.000 --> 54:23.680]  And the dominoes are falling, the program has already started, the countdown is here,
[54:23.680 --> 54:29.640]  and I don't know what to do, I just get right with God, that's all I can say, instead we'll
[54:29.640 --> 54:35.680]  talk to my pillow guy, which will be fine, I'm sure, nice guy, really cares, has a good
[54:35.680 --> 54:41.840]  heart, fight the tyranny, fight the election fraud that's as plain as the nose on your
[54:41.840 --> 54:48.600]  face, and I only go ahead and just throw all this out to everybody, because all you idiots,
[54:48.600 --> 54:54.000]  because I know media matters, all you dumbasses tune in, this is all real stuff, you understand
[54:54.000 --> 54:58.000]  you're going to be killed, right, you understand you're dead, not from me, you're your bosses,
[54:58.000 --> 55:02.600]  you understand these are psychotics, they made a deal with something really bad that
[55:02.600 --> 55:08.600]  says the price of you living is everybody else dies, remember Soros made a deal when
[55:08.600 --> 55:12.760]  he was a kid with Hitler to do that, so of course he's one of the top guys now, because
[55:12.760 --> 55:18.640]  he made a deal with something infinitely more evil and smarter, and you just look at this
[55:18.640 --> 55:23.320]  thing, it's not human, it's hitting us, this whole takeover, the 5G all of it is not of
[55:23.320 --> 55:31.040]  this world, all right, Mike Lindell got off his airplane, but it's late, he'll be here
[55:31.040 --> 55:35.360]  soon, I look forward to having him on, and I'll try to get into statistics from a CDC,
[55:35.360 --> 55:39.880]  they admit massive death brain damage from their shots in young people, and they're
[55:39.880 --> 55:44.240]  just going to normalize, like we don't just make young boys die now, with autism, we're
[55:44.240 --> 55:47.880]  going to kill everybody.
[55:47.880 --> 55:53.280]  As negative as times are right now, and as depressing as things can be, you have to
[55:53.280 --> 56:02.160]  understand that this is all a test, this experience, this life on this planet is a reckoning,
[56:02.160 --> 56:07.440]  it's God giving us a chance to work things out with third dimension, so we can decide
[56:07.440 --> 56:11.520]  where we want to spend eternity, and what level we want to go to, and it really does
[56:11.520 --> 56:16.120]  come down to that, so as sad as things are, and as evil as things are, look at all the
[56:16.120 --> 56:21.080]  good in the world as well, and realize that God is the author of our consciousness, God
[56:21.080 --> 56:27.480]  is the author of us having our own will, God is the author of us having free will, and
[56:27.480 --> 56:32.480]  that free will is a beautiful thing, and when you look at mainstream media in Hollywood
[56:32.480 --> 56:38.200]  and this whole evil culture, and Washington DC, and Fauci, and the mass cult, it's all
[56:38.200 --> 56:41.880]  about dominating your free will, it's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly,
[56:41.880 --> 56:45.920]  you're in the bad, because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the
[56:45.920 --> 56:48.920]  creator of the universe.
[56:48.920 --> 56:55.600]  Big Pharma was born out of the Rockefeller oil industry in 1900, with the petrochemical.
[56:55.600 --> 57:01.840]  The petrochemical then dominated two major industries, plastics and drugs.
[57:01.840 --> 57:08.160]  Companies began synthesizing patented versions of naturally sourced drugs, the natural sources
[57:08.160 --> 57:14.160]  were then made illegal, pharmaceuticals became medicine, and the sicker people got, the more
[57:14.160 --> 57:19.680]  their industry grew, it's a death cult, and it's up to the individual to escape.
[57:19.680 --> 57:26.120]  The health begins with a healthy immune system, which needs the proper nutrients to thrive.
[57:26.120 --> 57:29.600]  Nutrients we cannot readily get from our food today.
[57:29.600 --> 57:34.680]  The combinations of vitamin C and zinc and vitamin D3 with calcium have been proven to
[57:34.680 --> 57:38.960]  be what we need to maintain a healthy immune system.
[57:38.960 --> 57:44.120]  Go to infoorstore.com and start supporting your natural immune system now, with the Mega
[57:44.120 --> 57:51.680]  Immune Support Pack, now 40% off.
[57:51.680 --> 58:17.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[58:17.680 --> 58:38.200]  It's a dream, you've got to be asleep to believe it, but in that it's a little twist.
[58:38.200 --> 58:43.480]  In the dream you find the destiny, it's where people came to live the dream, what was so
[58:43.480 --> 58:50.600]  amazing compared to other countries and other nations, oh we were down in the dirt one step
[58:50.600 --> 58:58.040]  above the others, reaching out to the stars, and there are evil people that want control
[58:58.040 --> 59:05.680]  of the future, control of our destinies to use our minds, our incredible intellects as
[59:05.680 --> 59:15.560]  slaves to build their godship, to build their ascension, but everything they do is the suppression
[59:15.560 --> 59:22.800]  of the innocent, which is not godlike, it's devillike, and so I go through processes of
[59:22.800 --> 59:27.960]  getting excited and vitriolic and getting depressed and upset, but it's just my own
[59:27.960 --> 59:34.560]  physical mind and body taking on the weight of what we have to face and being energized
[59:34.560 --> 59:40.640]  by the Holy Spirit to go to the next level, because great responsibility is not something
[59:40.640 --> 59:44.720]  that's fun, it's something that's empowering, it's exhilarating, it's something that gives
[59:44.720 --> 59:48.280]  you the next level, but it's not about yourself.
[59:48.280 --> 59:52.280]  Here's a little fun thing that a listener put together, but it's an archetype of what
[59:52.280 --> 59:55.720]  we're actually facing, and it's the listener taking action that's victory, so we salute
[59:55.720 --> 59:56.720]  the listener.
[59:56.720 --> 1:00:00.720]  We'll be back with Michael and Dell, stay with us.
[1:00:00.720 --> 1:00:15.520]  I want this to sink in on this Tuesday, September 22nd, and it's just a time to have
[1:00:15.520 --> 1:00:20.000]  our heads screwed on straight and to get on our knees to God, because this is the big
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:23.880]  one, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:00:23.880 --> 1:00:33.320]  We are not living in normal times, we're living in the year 2020, but I'll tell you this,
[1:00:33.320 --> 1:00:37.520]  we're living in such an incredibly amazing and thought provoking and dangerous time that
[1:00:37.520 --> 1:00:44.400]  there was a film made in the early 1990s that described exactly what's happening, but it
[1:00:44.400 --> 1:00:53.960]  condensed it down to something very simple, something that happened very quickly, because
[1:00:53.960 --> 1:01:00.120]  a real weapon takes its time so you never know what hit you.
[1:01:00.120 --> 1:01:08.720]  That way you don't see it creeping up, because we knew this was coming down, we knew what
[1:01:08.720 --> 1:01:18.520]  they were planning, and now we're sure of it.
[1:01:18.520 --> 1:01:25.280]  They are going to scuttle the whole country and bring it down.
[1:01:25.280 --> 1:01:33.720]  It's just that simple, because where this AI is taking us is a nightmare situation, but
[1:01:33.720 --> 1:01:38.880]  they are going to try, execute their operation even though we're aware of it.
[1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:39.880]  They don't care.
[1:01:39.880 --> 1:01:40.880]  This is a doomsday scenario.
[1:01:40.880 --> 1:01:49.040]  By the way, you know what the Pentagon back in the 70s called this satellite grid, looked
[1:01:49.040 --> 1:01:51.920]  into the internet, track everything you do?
[1:01:51.920 --> 1:02:01.800]  They called it Skynet, and we cannot sit here and let them do it, because this country is
[1:02:01.800 --> 1:02:06.000]  going to take two minutes from destruction, total annihilation, and war on the streets,
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:09.600]  and everything we've built, plus down the toilet.
[1:02:09.600 --> 1:02:18.000]  There's red fire in the sky to try to exterminate humanity, the technology that they have deployed
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:23.320]  and developed to replace us, we're accepting Skynet and the AI system here.
[1:02:23.320 --> 1:02:31.120]  I've said it before and I'll say it again, resistors is victory.
[1:02:31.120 --> 1:02:38.120]  That simple, initial decision to stand up and to get involved and to take action is
[1:02:38.120 --> 1:02:42.120]  the most important decision you can make in the fight for freedom and human dignity.
[1:02:42.120 --> 1:02:49.120]  You think you're going to have this fight and have robots win it?
[1:02:49.120 --> 1:02:50.120]  No!
[1:02:50.120 --> 1:02:56.360]  I say to you, your technocracy is down or I will!
[1:02:56.360 --> 1:03:01.680]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on there, about looking at
[1:03:01.680 --> 1:03:05.640]  the world from the perspective of the globalists, that the public is so dumbed down that they
[1:03:05.640 --> 1:03:08.840]  don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning them, that
[1:03:08.840 --> 1:03:12.080]  we're sterilizing them, that they deserve to be killed.
[1:03:12.080 --> 1:03:16.560]  Yes, that's the position of the globalists, they play God, and they think because we don't
[1:03:16.560 --> 1:03:19.600]  stand up, they have a right to do this to us.
[1:03:19.600 --> 1:03:23.880]  And I've told you that the globalists have tried to harm you, they've tried to get you
[1:03:23.880 --> 1:03:29.400]  away from them, but metaphysically at a spiritual level, I have the Holy Spirit, I'm the connection
[1:03:29.400 --> 1:03:34.000]  of God, and I know that God is my life, so I cannot join the enemy.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:38.480]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with
[1:03:38.480 --> 1:03:42.880]  the system, believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power out of it.
[1:03:42.880 --> 1:03:48.720]  Whether you're just a steelworker or a schoolteacher or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God.
[1:03:48.720 --> 1:03:53.280]  And treating other people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real
[1:03:53.280 --> 1:04:00.280]  God of the universe doesn't like, and that's a fact.
[1:04:23.280 --> 1:04:31.720]  Alright, man, I'll tell you, a wild Skype video right before we went live of watching
[1:04:31.720 --> 1:04:37.280]  Mike Lindell flying in on a private airplane in some rough weather about to go live with
[1:04:37.280 --> 1:04:41.280]  us, and then his feed cut out, so we'll see how fast we're able to get him back up.
[1:04:41.280 --> 1:04:47.000]  He told us he'd interview us as soon as he was on the ground.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:50.640]  He's definitely fighting back, he's the example of what we should all be, it's very exciting.
[1:04:50.640 --> 1:04:54.160]  I got pretty wound up last hour, I got some heavy issues, but I'm just telling you where
[1:04:54.160 --> 1:04:56.560]  the globalists want to take us if they succeed.
[1:04:56.560 --> 1:04:57.560]  They're going to fail.
[1:04:57.560 --> 1:05:02.480]  But as we get Mike Lindell back on and ready, please remember we're listed supported and
[1:05:02.480 --> 1:05:06.560]  I thank you all and you're amazing, just like they tried to bankrupt and shut down Mike
[1:05:06.560 --> 1:05:10.560]  Lindell, they tried to shut us down, but thanks to your support, we're still on air and still
[1:05:10.560 --> 1:05:12.320]  more effective than ever.
[1:05:12.320 --> 1:05:17.480]  So we're introducing the brand new mega immune support supplements, highest in high quality
[1:05:17.480 --> 1:05:22.520]  at a low price, these are high end vitamins and products that are at a low price, 40%
[1:05:22.520 --> 1:05:26.720]  off of the trifecta of all three of the new products.

[1:05:31.040 --> 1:05:38.360]  concentrated vegetables and herbs and things like that, 25% off on the Whole Food Multivitamin,
[1:05:38.360 --> 1:05:45.760]  25% off on the Vitamin C and Zinc and Rose Hems and InfoWarsLife Vitamin D3 Gummies

[1:05:50.560 --> 1:05:57.000]  high quality and they're all big doses of safe vitamins to take at large doses.
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:06:01.200]  Take our Vitamin C, it's a Linus Pauling, one of the Nobel's prize for it.
[1:06:01.200 --> 1:06:07.080]  He recommended 11, 100% redali allowance of an organic source of Vitamin C, he recommended
[1:06:07.080 --> 1:06:08.080]  Rose Hems.
[1:06:08.080 --> 1:06:12.880]  Well, we have the Nobel Prize formula right there, 50 something years ago.
[1:06:12.880 --> 1:06:16.480]  He even talks about that now, but that's incredible with this Zinc, with it.
[1:06:16.480 --> 1:06:20.840]  So these are all the very best formula, that's a super old formula.
[1:06:20.840 --> 1:06:24.240]  With our Whole Food formula, it's one of the newest developments, how they extract it and
[1:06:24.240 --> 1:06:25.240]  concentrate it.
[1:06:25.240 --> 1:06:29.480]  So what's new that's great we take, what's old that's great we take, 40% off all three
[1:06:29.480 --> 1:06:33.160]  products together, infowarsstore.com, 40% off that's how you fund our operation plus

[1:06:39.600 --> 1:06:46.960]  And so, now without further ado, we are joined by somebody that I feel like I've known for
[1:06:46.960 --> 1:06:51.440]  years, had a chance to shake his hand a few times at different events that we were at
[1:06:51.440 --> 1:06:52.440]  together in D.C.
[1:06:52.440 --> 1:06:56.240]  But I feel like I know him because I've seen him in so many interviews, I've seen so many
[1:06:56.240 --> 1:06:59.840]  of his commercials and I've also bought a few of his products that are excellent and
[1:06:59.840 --> 1:07:02.060]  that of course is Mike Lindell.
[1:07:02.060 --> 1:07:09.320]  But he went from being a cool guy in my eyes to a hero when he took on the election fraud,
[1:07:09.320 --> 1:07:14.920]  when he spent so much of his fortune on it and despite all the lies and all the demonization,
[1:07:14.920 --> 1:07:18.440]  he didn't just persevere, he got stronger.
[1:07:18.440 --> 1:07:24.800]  So, Mike Lindell, Michael James Lindell also known as MyPillowGuys, an American businessman
[1:07:24.800 --> 1:07:29.120]  and the founder and CEO of MyPillow Inc., Lindell is a prominent supporter and advisor
[1:07:29.120 --> 1:07:34.720]  to former U.S. President Donald Trump, a staunch proponent of liberty, a amazing free
[1:07:34.720 --> 1:07:41.600]  speech stalwart and he's fighting hard for election integrity, MyPillow.com and Frankspeech.com.
[1:07:41.600 --> 1:07:46.160]  Needs no introduction, but he's an example to us all, he's gone through the fiery furnace
[1:07:46.160 --> 1:07:48.360]  in the lion's den and come out stronger.
[1:07:48.360 --> 1:07:51.960]  Mike, great to finally get you on air with us, thank you so much.
[1:07:51.960 --> 1:07:54.600]  Thanks for having me on.
[1:07:54.600 --> 1:07:57.560]  You're a busy guy working 20 hours a day, wow.
[1:07:57.560 --> 1:08:03.560]  Yeah, I just landed, I'm in Michigan today, I've been going all around this country trying
[1:08:03.560 --> 1:08:08.200]  to get this election pulled down and we will get it pulled down.
[1:08:08.200 --> 1:08:10.800]  Sir, it's amazing to have you.
[1:08:10.800 --> 1:08:16.360]  You said months ago that you would soon see other states going to Arizona and duplicating
[1:08:16.360 --> 1:08:17.360]  what they've done.
[1:08:17.360 --> 1:08:20.680]  I said, well, this is a real guy, he's flying all around the country, working with folks,
[1:08:20.680 --> 1:08:21.680]  I believe it.
[1:08:21.680 --> 1:08:26.760]  Now we're seeing it, give us an update on your research, what you found, what your forensic
[1:08:26.760 --> 1:08:31.800]  experts have developed, you've been leading the way in really proving that this election
[1:08:31.800 --> 1:08:33.760]  was fraudulent.
[1:08:33.760 --> 1:08:40.040]  Well we all know it was completely fraudulent and from November 4th on I've been fighting
[1:08:40.040 --> 1:08:46.440]  every day putting in all my research, everything I could, but on January 9th I got something
[1:08:46.440 --> 1:08:53.080]  that was completely different and it was from the machines, a cyber attack and with that
[1:08:53.080 --> 1:08:59.160]  I have not let up because we have the, they're called packet captures and this is like a,
[1:08:59.160 --> 1:09:03.600]  what they are, they're like cyber forensics that you would use if you had a crime scene,
[1:09:03.600 --> 1:09:08.880]  a murder scene and you had the blood forensic DNA, this is better than that.
[1:09:08.880 --> 1:09:16.320]  This is the packet captures of all the flip and all the attacks from China and other countries
[1:09:16.320 --> 1:09:20.840]  and all these, because you couldn't have done this without computers, this massive flip
[1:09:20.840 --> 1:09:22.560]  and this massive fraud.
[1:09:22.560 --> 1:09:26.880]  Now, yeah, and there's the picture there when I was at the White House trying to get this
[1:09:26.880 --> 1:09:33.080]  to the president then and from that point on I have been attacked by box stores dropping
[1:09:33.080 --> 1:09:38.760]  me Twitter, Facebook, you name it, but it's been, it's been a pretty amazing because it's
[1:09:38.760 --> 1:09:43.160]  like you're sitting here with a royal flush in a poker game and we're just waiting to
[1:09:43.160 --> 1:09:44.160]  play it.
[1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:48.680]  We're going to, we're going to bring it to the Supreme Court in July as a cold war
[1:09:48.680 --> 1:09:49.680]  in tow.
[1:09:49.680 --> 1:09:54.560]  It's just a matter of getting the word out to every, every person in this country getting
[1:09:54.560 --> 1:09:58.880]  it out there so the Supreme Court has pressure to accept it.
[1:09:58.880 --> 1:10:04.280]  Now all of these things going on right now, all the Maricopa audits, we're going to Pennsylvania
[1:10:04.280 --> 1:10:11.040]  now, you've got Wisconsin, you've got Michigan, New Hampshire, all of them are going to show
[1:10:11.040 --> 1:10:15.760]  the same thing what we already know, but it's going to be a great validation and, and, and
[1:10:15.760 --> 1:10:17.480]  they're getting, that part's getting the news.
[1:10:17.480 --> 1:10:21.960]  I mean, Maricopa, there's just been so much pushback because they know what we're going
[1:10:21.960 --> 1:10:28.200]  to find and we're, you know, trying to get, they've stopped, stopped trying to, from
[1:10:28.200 --> 1:10:32.640]  just getting the routers, which the routers are big because then it shows who did it,
[1:10:32.640 --> 1:10:36.920]  which we know, we know where most of the attacks, the cyber attacks came from.
[1:10:36.920 --> 1:10:42.080]  And then you've got Michigan, where, you know, the only judge that ever looked at this in
[1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:46.840]  November was in Andrum County and that went what four or five months and then all of a
[1:10:46.840 --> 1:10:52.480]  sudden they decide to, even though they found 7,000 votes flipped, decide, well, just, we're
[1:10:52.480 --> 1:10:56.160]  just going to stop that from going on, from going further.
[1:10:56.160 --> 1:10:58.600]  So they're appealing that, but things are going great.
[1:10:58.600 --> 1:11:02.160]  I couldn't be happier the way things are going in our country right now.
[1:11:02.160 --> 1:11:06.280]  Like I said before, our president will be back, I said August, I could be off by a month
[1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:07.280]  or two.
[1:11:07.280 --> 1:11:12.120]  Well, I know this, you've been quarterbacking the resistance and I believe in you.
[1:11:12.120 --> 1:11:14.200]  And I know you've been behind the scenes, I've talked to a lot of folks you've been
[1:11:14.200 --> 1:11:19.440]  working with, I'll leave it at that, but President Trump, our real president, in now
[1:11:19.440 --> 1:11:25.760]  in his second term with the Chinese agent, Biden there this weekend, as you know, he
[1:11:25.760 --> 1:11:30.280]  came out in the video saying, oh, we're going to take back the Senate, we're going to take
[1:11:30.280 --> 1:11:33.680]  back the House and the White House sooner than you think.
[1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:39.480]  And I've talked with Trump, he is really excited and he believes when the evidence comes out,
[1:11:39.480 --> 1:11:40.880]  there's a strategy.
[1:11:40.880 --> 1:11:43.480]  So wow, tell us about that.
[1:11:43.480 --> 1:11:52.240]  Well, the strategy is once the election gets pulled down, I really believe when the Supreme
[1:11:52.240 --> 1:11:55.520]  Court looks at this, it's not subjective evidence.
[1:11:55.520 --> 1:12:03.360]  So it's going to be 9-0, not 8-1, 7-2, it has to be 9-0 because this isn't subjective
[1:12:03.360 --> 1:12:04.520]  evidence.
[1:12:04.520 --> 1:12:09.120]  So they're going to pull this down and now everybody needs to know there's a couple
[1:12:09.120 --> 1:12:10.240]  other things.
[1:12:10.240 --> 1:12:15.680]  One is, there were many down tickets, too, that were flipped, especially with senators
[1:12:15.680 --> 1:12:22.760]  like John James, both senators in Georgia, Jason Lewis from Minnesota, many congressmen,
[1:12:22.760 --> 1:12:29.000]  many, I mean, this wasn't just at the presidential level and in our country, I want everybody
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:34.760]  to know this, there's no statute of limitations on this, everyone says, come on Mike, that's
[1:12:34.760 --> 1:12:35.760]  too hard to believe.
[1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:40.720]  Well, let me tell you something, would you believe we'd be in this position a year and
[1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:41.720]  a half ago?
[1:12:41.720 --> 1:12:42.720]  No.
[1:12:42.720 --> 1:12:48.040]  So, but I will tell you this, every election in the United States is history.
[1:12:48.040 --> 1:12:53.720]  If you find out there was a crime committed after the fact or that the other person won
[1:12:53.720 --> 1:12:57.960]  in any way, let's say it was just a mistake, whatever it was, they put the person that
[1:12:57.960 --> 1:13:03.560]  won back in office and if there was a crime committed by anyone else, they get arrested.
[1:13:03.560 --> 1:13:07.800]  That's right, let's use the sports analogy that's happened hundreds of times, prominently
[1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:13.320]  thousands of times in smaller cases, where you find out the other team cheated, so the
[1:13:13.320 --> 1:13:17.720]  other team cheated, they then forfeit it and then it's given to who they actually cheated
[1:13:17.720 --> 1:13:18.720]  against.
[1:13:18.720 --> 1:13:25.920]  Right, exactly, and so we do have precedents here in the United States and the whole world
[1:13:25.920 --> 1:13:33.320]  is watching and my whole plan since January 9th, once I got these guys approached me,
[1:13:33.320 --> 1:13:37.840]  I think everybody's seen me on Jimmy Kimmel, when I was on there, he said something to
[1:13:37.840 --> 1:13:42.440]  me, he goes, Mike, what if the shoe was on the other foot and you had what you have now?
[1:13:42.440 --> 1:13:47.280]  If I had the same evidence I have now, which would ruin our country forever, it wouldn't
[1:13:47.280 --> 1:13:50.520]  matter who got, if Donald Trump got put in on December 14th.
[1:13:50.520 --> 1:13:52.120]  Explain that, we gotta go to break.
[1:13:52.120 --> 1:13:54.880]  Michael Lindell, please stay with us, amazing.
[1:13:54.880 --> 1:13:58.080]  Gerald in South Carolina, go ahead, you're on the air, trying to move quicker.
[1:13:58.080 --> 1:13:59.080]  Hey Alex, welcome.
[1:13:59.080 --> 1:14:03.360]  I would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all
[1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:04.360]  this stupidity.
[1:14:04.360 --> 1:14:07.800]  I wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year, okay?
[1:14:07.800 --> 1:14:14.520]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[1:14:14.520 --> 1:14:16.000]  Living defense saved my life.
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:20.360]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[1:14:20.360 --> 1:14:21.800]  Living defense brought me back.
[1:14:21.800 --> 1:14:27.480]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[1:14:27.480 --> 1:14:34.280]  This is Matthew 24, verse nine, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall
[1:14:34.280 --> 1:14:39.200]  kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[1:14:39.200 --> 1:14:44.560]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[1:14:44.560 --> 1:14:46.320]  That's right where we're at brother.
[1:14:46.320 --> 1:14:50.760]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say,
[1:14:50.760 --> 1:14:59.600]  and that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[1:14:59.600 --> 1:15:00.600]  Randy Dewright.
[1:15:00.600 --> 1:15:01.600]  Randy Dewright.
[1:15:01.600 --> 1:15:02.600]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[1:15:02.600 --> 1:15:03.600]  Go ahead.
[1:15:03.600 --> 1:15:04.600]  Challenge.
[1:15:04.600 --> 1:15:06.000]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:11.520]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:17.000]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:26.320]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[1:15:26.320 --> 1:15:30.360]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[1:15:30.360 --> 1:15:33.960]  what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[1:15:33.960 --> 1:15:38.480]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period
[1:15:38.480 --> 1:15:43.640]  of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is
[1:15:43.640 --> 1:15:44.640]  wonderful.
[1:15:44.640 --> 1:15:51.040]  You know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully
[1:15:51.040 --> 1:15:58.160]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:15:58.160 --> 1:16:14.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:16:14.960 --> 1:16:21.920]  If we want freedom, we need men and women in the arena and just during this last break,
[1:16:21.920 --> 1:16:27.200]  I was asking Mike Lindell, what is it like to be directly in the highest level of attack
[1:16:27.200 --> 1:16:31.240]  only other person being attacked more is President Trump.
[1:16:31.240 --> 1:16:34.440]  Mike Lindell stood up as a leader and has been leading the charge.
[1:16:34.440 --> 1:16:35.760]  He was telling me some of the behind the scenes stuff.
[1:16:35.760 --> 1:16:41.280]  I don't know how much he can say on air, but wow, where the audits are going, the big rallies
[1:16:41.280 --> 1:16:42.720]  he's got set up.
[1:16:42.720 --> 1:16:46.720]  I mean, true leadership and I'm not kissing your butts or it's true.
[1:16:46.720 --> 1:16:47.960]  You are a hard charger.
[1:16:47.960 --> 1:16:50.480]  You're a great leader and example for us all.
[1:16:50.480 --> 1:16:54.120]  What can you tell the listeners about what's going on behind the scenes with your lawsuit
[1:16:54.120 --> 1:16:56.040]  against Dominion and others?
[1:16:56.040 --> 1:16:59.760]  Well, last Thursday, this is very interesting everybody.
[1:16:59.760 --> 1:17:05.240]  Last Thursday, now remember that Dominion sued after I kept asking him to sue me, which
[1:17:05.240 --> 1:17:08.600]  I did and they finally did about a month ago.
[1:17:08.600 --> 1:17:09.760]  There was a reason for that.
[1:17:09.760 --> 1:17:14.400]  Well, they went ahead and sued my pillow, which that was horrific, but that they would
[1:17:14.400 --> 1:17:17.080]  go after the company had nothing to do with it.
[1:17:17.080 --> 1:17:22.360]  But so my pillow sued him a couple of weeks ago and that was an even Alan Dershowitz is
[1:17:22.360 --> 1:17:29.240]  involved in that and he said it'll be the most important case in history for free speech
[1:17:29.240 --> 1:17:31.160]  and for our first amendment rights.
[1:17:31.160 --> 1:17:33.880]  Now last Thursday, this is really key.
[1:17:33.880 --> 1:17:37.040]  I sued Dominion and Smartmatic.
[1:17:37.040 --> 1:17:42.360]  I threw them in there too because they're all in cahoots together and for $2 billion,
[1:17:42.360 --> 1:17:49.000]  you didn't hear about that probably in the news, but I even put their lawyers as co-conspirators.
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:54.680]  I put down their lawyers because their lawyers have served papers, either lawsuits or threatening
[1:17:54.680 --> 1:18:01.160]  letters to over 200 people in this country and news outlets, including Fox and whoever.
[1:18:01.160 --> 1:18:04.040]  So everybody lives in fear of being sued.
[1:18:04.040 --> 1:18:08.960]  Well, when I did that last Thursday, I had to get a local council in Minnesota.
[1:18:08.960 --> 1:18:10.040]  I got so many lawyers.
[1:18:10.040 --> 1:18:14.360]  I don't even know their names, but I got a local council in Minnesota to serve them
[1:18:14.360 --> 1:18:17.160]  in Minneapolis federal court.
[1:18:17.160 --> 1:18:19.240]  This law firm said, yes, that's great.
[1:18:19.240 --> 1:18:20.240]  We'll do it.
[1:18:20.240 --> 1:18:21.240]  So we did it.
[1:18:21.240 --> 1:18:22.240]  They signed up.
[1:18:22.240 --> 1:18:28.320]  They were attacked on Thursday night by bots and trolls and email and the left and the
[1:18:28.320 --> 1:18:29.320]  communism.
[1:18:29.320 --> 1:18:30.800]  Who knows who all attacked them?
[1:18:30.800 --> 1:18:36.680]  So then on Friday, they fired one of their lawyers and said that they blamed it on that
[1:18:36.680 --> 1:18:41.240]  lawyer for even taking Mike Lindell's case so they could get out there out from under
[1:18:41.240 --> 1:18:42.240]  the attack.
[1:18:42.240 --> 1:18:47.080]  It's just more cancel culture and these, I'll tell you what, the CCP, the U.S.
[1:18:47.080 --> 1:18:52.360]  CCP that's taken over our country, I mean, I'll tell you what, right now, in this lawsuit
[1:18:52.360 --> 1:19:00.720]  too, this lawsuit, I put a movie in there, it's a short video called Absolutely 9-0.
[1:19:00.720 --> 1:19:03.400]  Early on the show, we talked about it.
[1:19:03.400 --> 1:19:05.440]  This is the cyber evidence.
[1:19:05.440 --> 1:19:07.760]  Everybody needs to watch this video.
[1:19:07.760 --> 1:19:09.800]  It's absolutely 9-0.
[1:19:09.800 --> 1:19:15.880]  This is the cyber proof against Dominion and against all this, it shows China attacking
[1:19:15.880 --> 1:19:20.080]  our country, what they did, it shows the CCP, it shows everything.
[1:19:20.080 --> 1:19:23.400]  And by the way, Mike, let me tell you this now, I'm not name dropping.
[1:19:23.400 --> 1:19:27.680]  I've gotten a call the last few months by two national talk show hosts that I told you
[1:19:27.680 --> 1:19:28.680]  the names you'd known.
[1:19:28.680 --> 1:19:30.400]  They're both the top guys in the country.
[1:19:30.400 --> 1:19:35.600]  They separately talked to top forensic computer scientists that worked for the biggest Fortune
[1:19:35.600 --> 1:19:36.800]  100 companies.
[1:19:36.800 --> 1:19:38.680]  They said, Mike Lindell is right.
[1:19:38.680 --> 1:19:43.080]  We have all the packets, all the proof, total fraud through Communist China, but not just
[1:19:43.080 --> 1:19:50.360]  digital balance, like the guy in Philadelphia found the USPS driver with a truck full of
[1:19:50.360 --> 1:19:52.160]  Mark Ballant for Joe Biden.
[1:19:52.160 --> 1:19:56.240]  But let me show you this right now, this is out of Axios.
[1:19:56.240 --> 1:20:01.120]  Half of the pandemic unemployment money may have been stolen, they go on to say at least
[1:20:01.120 --> 1:20:09.520]  400 billion has been stolen and it links to outside cyber criminals in China so they could
[1:20:09.520 --> 1:20:14.840]  steal half of the unemployment benefits off federal websites, but not regular people couldn't
[1:20:14.840 --> 1:20:15.840]  get on them.
[1:20:15.840 --> 1:20:18.480]  Imagine what they can do to voting machines.
[1:20:18.480 --> 1:20:22.520]  Here it is right here, Mike, what you're saying, but they act like you're a crazy liar.
[1:20:22.520 --> 1:20:24.520]  Yeah, I know.
[1:20:24.520 --> 1:20:25.520]  And you know what?
[1:20:25.520 --> 1:20:31.720]  You know, like they say, I've been attacked every day since January 9th and but you know
[1:20:31.720 --> 1:20:32.720]  what?
[1:20:32.720 --> 1:20:38.480]  The way that the way it's worked in our country here with your foxes and your and your CNNs
[1:20:38.480 --> 1:20:43.520]  and your, you know, your Newsmax and all of these stations is these mainstream media.
[1:20:43.520 --> 1:20:44.520]  They won't hit.
[1:20:44.520 --> 1:20:46.080]  You can't say the word Dominion.
[1:20:46.080 --> 1:20:48.400]  You can't say that it was a cyber attack.
[1:20:48.400 --> 1:20:49.960]  You can't say anything.
[1:20:49.960 --> 1:20:54.680]  So I've had to just put up with the attacks against my pillow and myself.
[1:20:54.680 --> 1:20:58.920]  At least I get in the news to be able to say, you know, they'll call me up, Mike, when Joe,
[1:20:58.920 --> 1:21:00.800]  you lost your my pillow Twitter.
[1:21:00.800 --> 1:21:04.720]  Did you hear about China attacking our country and hack it into our election?
[1:21:04.720 --> 1:21:07.120]  And then the next guy I'll call this went on.
[1:21:07.120 --> 1:21:12.760]  Alex, this went on all, all through the month of January and into February.
[1:21:12.760 --> 1:21:16.520]  And I kept telling him on February 5th, I'm coming out with all the evidence that there
[1:21:16.520 --> 1:21:19.840]  was a movie I made called absolute proof.
[1:21:19.840 --> 1:21:24.600]  When that came out on February 5th, all of the, all of the mainstream media, a New York
[1:21:24.600 --> 1:21:29.480]  Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, everybody's got my direct number.
[1:21:29.480 --> 1:21:34.760]  They would call me all day long then, then November or February 5th came, I dropped that
[1:21:34.760 --> 1:21:37.760]  movie out there and it was cricking.
[1:21:37.760 --> 1:21:38.760]  Nobody called.
[1:21:38.760 --> 1:21:39.760]  They didn't write.
[1:21:39.760 --> 1:21:40.880]  They didn't do anything.
[1:21:40.880 --> 1:21:43.280]  And so that's another way to stop you.
[1:21:43.280 --> 1:21:46.440]  It shows how controlled they are that they're all in lockstep.
[1:21:46.440 --> 1:21:51.280]  But exactly whatever these couples have done as citizens, we have a right to challenge.
[1:21:51.280 --> 1:21:53.440]  Democrats said they were going to challenge a Trump victory.
[1:21:53.440 --> 1:21:55.080]  They said they were never going to accept it.
[1:21:55.080 --> 1:22:00.400]  So how are we terrorists now to question an election that had so many anomalies?
[1:22:00.400 --> 1:22:09.040]  And what's really even more bizarre is the Democrats warned us, Amy Klobuchar in my movie,
[1:22:09.040 --> 1:22:14.400]  even Kamala Harris, these guys, they warned us of these machines that our election in
[1:22:14.400 --> 1:22:16.320]  2020 was going to get hacked.
[1:22:16.320 --> 1:22:17.880]  They all warned us of it.
[1:22:17.880 --> 1:22:20.040]  They warned us of it and then it gets hacked.
[1:22:20.040 --> 1:22:24.080]  Now I'll tell you what, if the shoe was on the other foot and I had the evidence I have
[1:22:24.080 --> 1:22:28.640]  right now and it was Donald Trump the one, I would still be sounding the alarm because
[1:22:28.640 --> 1:22:33.160]  if you never have a vote, a fair vote again in history, it's over for us.
[1:22:33.160 --> 1:22:35.360]  China win, China win.
[1:22:35.360 --> 1:22:40.400]  So when you take that into play there, right now it doesn't matter if you're a Democrat
[1:22:40.400 --> 1:22:47.080]  or a Republican, you got to be so concerned about what went on and that we need to pull
[1:22:47.080 --> 1:22:50.200]  this election out and get rid of these machines forever.
[1:22:50.200 --> 1:22:54.240]  I said it the other day, I said, you know, if it was flipped and I'd be sounding the
[1:22:54.240 --> 1:22:57.280]  alarm, hey, Donald Trump didn't win.
[1:22:57.280 --> 1:22:58.800]  China attacked our election.
[1:22:58.800 --> 1:23:02.800]  The only difference would be it would take two days for the election to get pulled down.
[1:23:02.800 --> 1:23:06.320]  Maybe even faster, all the mainstream media would go, what?
[1:23:06.320 --> 1:23:07.960]  You mean they hacked our election?
[1:23:07.960 --> 1:23:09.120]  Let's pull it down.
[1:23:09.120 --> 1:23:14.520]  But you just showed the China president there, let me tell you, China by hacking it and taking
[1:23:14.520 --> 1:23:19.680]  our election and what we're seeing in Washington right now, I have Democrat friends of mine
[1:23:19.680 --> 1:23:23.400]  and they're going, we didn't vote for this, of course you didn't.
[1:23:23.400 --> 1:23:29.320]  We voted for communism coming into our country and you know, when the first thing you do,
[1:23:29.320 --> 1:23:35.480]  you cancel 50,000 union jobs and 13 people have already committed suicide up there at
[1:23:35.480 --> 1:23:36.600]  that pipeline.
[1:23:36.600 --> 1:23:41.280]  The first thing you do is to destroy the gas prices, destroy the middle class, they've
[1:23:41.280 --> 1:23:47.240]  already destroyed so many small businesses in this country with this, but the other things
[1:23:47.240 --> 1:23:48.240]  they've done.
[1:23:48.240 --> 1:23:52.960]  But I'll tell you, it's really helping out that they should have waited.
[1:23:52.960 --> 1:23:58.720]  If I was a Democrat party, a communist, I would have waited and then destroyed our country
[1:23:58.720 --> 1:24:03.160]  after, you know, because everyone would go, hey, this isn't so bad, but they keep doing
[1:24:03.160 --> 1:24:08.680]  these horrible things every day, every single day, another executive order, another terrible
[1:24:08.680 --> 1:24:09.680]  thing.
[1:24:09.680 --> 1:24:14.560]  Shutting down the pipelines, authorizing Russian and Chinese pipelines, saying we can only
[1:24:14.560 --> 1:24:18.800]  buy batteries from China, can't produce batteries in America.
[1:24:18.800 --> 1:24:23.240]  Mike Lindell is on fire and he's the example of what all Americans should do.
[1:24:23.240 --> 1:24:27.760]  They've attacked him, he didn't back down, he charged out there and people supported
[1:24:27.760 --> 1:24:28.760]  him more than ever.
[1:24:28.760 --> 1:24:33.920]  That's why everybody should go to his website, mypillow.com, because I already had some MyPillows,
[1:24:33.920 --> 1:24:34.920]  they're great.
[1:24:34.920 --> 1:24:39.400]  I bought like 20 of them when he was fighting because just like you gotta support us folks,
[1:24:39.400 --> 1:24:43.200]  you've got to back up men and women that are willing to put it on the line.
[1:24:43.200 --> 1:24:45.600]  This guy is a modern American hero.
[1:24:45.600 --> 1:24:49.640]  Mike Lindell is our guest here on InfoWars, we'll be right back on the other side to
[1:24:49.640 --> 1:24:54.160]  stay with us.
[1:24:54.160 --> 1:24:57.600]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[1:24:57.600 --> 1:25:01.800]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[1:25:01.800 --> 1:25:05.800]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck, the big, globalist
[1:25:05.800 --> 1:25:09.400]  publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[1:25:09.400 --> 1:25:14.040]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air and please report to local states here listening
[1:25:14.040 --> 1:25:15.040]  to us well.

[1:25:25.720 --> 1:25:27.200]  in the face of this thing.
[1:25:27.200 --> 1:25:29.320]  I need your help more than ever now.
[1:25:29.320 --> 1:25:33.640]  I want to keep fighting the globalists but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[1:25:33.640 --> 1:25:39.040]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can and buy great

[1:25:54.120 --> 1:25:55.120]  much.
[1:25:55.120 --> 1:26:02.040]  Big Pharma was born out of the Rockefeller oil industry in 1900 with the petrochemical.
[1:26:02.040 --> 1:26:08.280]  The petrochemical then dominated two major industries, plastics and drugs.
[1:26:08.280 --> 1:26:13.440]  Companies began synthesizing patented versions of naturally sourced drugs.
[1:26:13.440 --> 1:26:19.440]  The natural sources were then made illegal, pharmaceuticals became medicine and the sicker
[1:26:19.440 --> 1:26:21.760]  people got the more their industry grew.
[1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:26.120]  It's a death cult and it's up to the individual to escape.
[1:26:26.120 --> 1:26:32.560]  Good health begins with a healthy immune system which needs the proper nutrients to thrive.
[1:26:32.560 --> 1:26:36.040]  Nutrients we cannot readily get from our food today.
[1:26:36.040 --> 1:26:41.120]  The combinations of vitamin C and zinc and vitamin D3 with calcium have been proven to
[1:26:41.120 --> 1:26:45.440]  be what we need to maintain a healthy immune system.
[1:26:45.440 --> 1:26:50.520]  Go to infowarsstore.com and start supporting your natural immune system now with the mega

[1:26:54.760 --> 1:26:59.800]  We here at Infowars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that
[1:26:59.800 --> 1:27:03.400]  is now available at infowarsstore.com.
[1:27:03.400 --> 1:27:07.560]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though
[1:27:07.560 --> 1:27:12.200]  it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and
[1:27:12.200 --> 1:27:14.040]  euphoric effects.
[1:27:14.040 --> 1:27:19.520]  According to ancient Samoan legend Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who
[1:27:19.520 --> 1:27:23.800]  they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[1:27:23.800 --> 1:27:28.480]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to
[1:27:28.480 --> 1:27:29.720]  loosen up a little.
[1:27:29.720 --> 1:27:34.600]  Nowadays Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[1:27:34.600 --> 1:27:40.600]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava but other
[1:27:40.600 --> 1:27:46.720]  herbs including but not limited to German Kava Mill, Organic Skull Cap and Valerian
[1:27:46.720 --> 1:27:47.720]  root.
[1:27:47.720 --> 1:27:55.440]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly so be sure to secure yours by visiting infowarsstore.com.
[1:27:55.440 --> 1:28:00.240]  It's not a secret why and left us controlled cities all over the world, not just the U.S.
[1:28:00.240 --> 1:28:05.000]  They encourage people to live in tents and he's just homeless, and he used drugs and
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  alcohol to engage in petty crime.
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:11.040]  It's because the globalists admit under Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, of course the Great Reset,
[1:28:11.040 --> 1:28:12.440]  they want to lower expectations.
[1:28:12.440 --> 1:28:16.520]  They don't want you to think of having sanitary systems everywhere, they don't want you to
[1:28:16.520 --> 1:28:20.240]  think of a civilization that gets better, they want you to think of a civilization that
[1:28:20.240 --> 1:28:22.400]  gets progressively worse.
[1:28:22.400 --> 1:28:26.840]  The globalists fly around in private jets, they have huge private mistakes, they are
[1:28:26.840 --> 1:28:27.920]  separate from us.
[1:28:27.920 --> 1:28:33.560]  Their children go to private tutors, they admit this, and now they want us locked down, telecommunicating
[1:28:33.560 --> 1:28:38.920]  with each other so that we are not actually out physically building a pro-human infrastructure.
[1:28:38.920 --> 1:28:44.200]  The infrastructure that's left under 5G is for the control robot autonomous cars and
[1:28:44.200 --> 1:28:45.200]  trucks.
[1:28:45.200 --> 1:28:46.720]  This is all their admitted plan.
[1:28:46.720 --> 1:28:51.000]  The public's finally listening because the plan is no longer in beta, it's gone operational.
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:57.760]  It's a post-human future, you better find out about it right now.
[1:28:57.760 --> 1:29:07.760]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:29:07.760 --> 1:29:31.320]  Well, the mighty Mike Lindell is here, I don't say that as a joke, he stood up, he put his
[1:29:31.320 --> 1:29:35.760]  money where his mouth was, he put it on the line, his whole fortune, his whole operation
[1:29:35.760 --> 1:29:40.760]  to expose the election fraud that was massive, that was incredible, that has been overwhelming,
[1:29:40.760 --> 1:29:45.640]  and he stood up against the gaslighting itself, and it's an example to others.
[1:29:45.640 --> 1:29:47.680]  My listeners still love Trump and I love Trump.
[1:29:47.680 --> 1:29:50.560]  I want him to run for president again, he is our president, I want him to run for the
[1:29:50.560 --> 1:29:52.840]  speaker house, whatever he wants.
[1:29:52.840 --> 1:29:58.400]  But from the listenership view on the street, people sort of ask me more often, do you know
[1:29:58.400 --> 1:30:01.520]  Mike Lindell instead of you know Trump?
[1:30:01.520 --> 1:30:08.160]  Here's an example, people want action, they want somebody to stand up, and I know Trump
[1:30:08.160 --> 1:30:13.080]  had to lick his wounds, get ready, totally cut off a few months to exercise, lose weight,
[1:30:13.080 --> 1:30:16.760]  Trump's looking great, he's giving speeches, they're threatening to arrest his whole family
[1:30:16.760 --> 1:30:18.680]  with setup, bogus stuff, he doesn't back down.
[1:30:18.680 --> 1:30:25.240]  I'm not criticizing Trump when I hold up Mike Lindell, I'm saying he's the example of putting
[1:30:25.240 --> 1:30:29.200]  it all on the line and being there, so I know you don't want to bring this up, I'm bringing
[1:30:29.200 --> 1:30:35.200]  up right now, how do people support with all the attacks you're under fighting the globalist,
[1:30:35.200 --> 1:30:38.640]  how do people support the work you're doing, because I know you're separate from my pillow
[1:30:38.640 --> 1:30:43.600]  with your political action, but how do people do that so they can buy the pillows and then
[1:30:43.600 --> 1:30:45.320]  finance what you're doing?
[1:30:45.320 --> 1:30:50.120]  Well, yeah, that's the best way is because you know Dominion attacked my employees whom
[1:30:50.120 --> 1:30:54.880]  we've lost all our readers, so people have really stepped up, you could use the promo
[1:30:54.880 --> 1:31:02.160]  code Mike today, just use Mike, and you can save up to 66% on all our products, we have
[1:31:02.160 --> 1:31:09.000]  over 110 products now too, not just pillows, we have slippers, we have the sheets, yeah,
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:15.400]  and we're launching everybody tonight at 3.30 in the morning, our first bed infomercial
[1:31:15.400 --> 1:31:21.680]  it took me two years to develop this bed, it'll be the best bed you'll ever sleep on,
[1:31:21.680 --> 1:31:25.600]  and right there you can see it in the middle of your screen, it's a coil sleep system there,
[1:31:25.600 --> 1:31:30.040]  and let me just say this, I'm pretty straight, but it could be a cactus, if it saves the
[1:31:30.040 --> 1:31:33.720]  country and my kids, I'm going to buy it, but it's a great product, people should get it,
[1:31:33.720 --> 1:31:34.720]  tell us about it.
[1:31:34.720 --> 1:31:41.400]  Yeah, it's an amazing bed, everything's made in the USA, and I reverse engineer things
[1:31:41.400 --> 1:31:48.520]  that actually help you sleep, there's coils that foam both, and they come in a box, and
[1:31:48.520 --> 1:31:54.040]  it's a reversible bed, it's everything, I went through piece by piece, and if it doesn't
[1:31:54.040 --> 1:32:01.680]  help you get good remand-delta sleep, I don't use it, I make stuff to help people, it really
[1:32:01.680 --> 1:32:02.680]  will work.
[1:32:02.680 --> 1:32:09.720]  The other thing too, if I could, I want to plug on, one of the things, my lindalerecoverynetwork.org,
[1:32:09.720 --> 1:32:16.080]  I set that up originally before this whole China virus and everything, and it's going
[1:32:16.080 --> 1:32:19.520]  strong now, because if you have people out there that are hurting in addiction, I used
[1:32:19.520 --> 1:32:25.200]  to be a former crack addict, you can send them there, and it's free, it's free to help
[1:32:25.200 --> 1:32:30.480]  people in addiction, and now we just put up a donate button there to help that, but you
[1:32:30.480 --> 1:32:31.480]  don't-
[1:32:31.480 --> 1:32:36.800]  And by the way, the left, let me bring this up, you started one of the biggest employers
[1:32:36.800 --> 1:32:40.920]  of Americans many years ago, after you got off the crack and all the rest of it, and
[1:32:40.920 --> 1:32:45.320]  you're a success story, the left tells us, oh, let's all be redemptive, let's worship
[1:32:45.320 --> 1:32:50.040]  all this, but you actually did it, they attack you all the time, but they love Hunter Biden,
[1:32:50.040 --> 1:32:55.920]  who's an ongoing crackhead, so I see that Rush Limbaugh had a problem after a back problem,
[1:32:55.920 --> 1:33:00.240]  he got better, he's a good guy, everybody's had family that's had problems, I've had problems
[1:33:00.240 --> 1:33:07.840]  with alcohol, so it puts you down over a substance, that's a positive, you look great, you're
[1:33:07.840 --> 1:33:12.160]  doing a great job, that you transformed and hired tens of thousands of people and are
[1:33:12.160 --> 1:33:16.680]  fighting for my free speech, my election integrity.
[1:33:16.680 --> 1:33:23.280]  Right, and you know what, and I think when we talk about addiction, addiction isn't just
[1:33:23.280 --> 1:33:27.640]  some homeless person you see on the street, it affects everyone, no matter how many forts
[1:33:27.640 --> 1:33:33.080]  you eat with, and so before this, this is the great position that you guys that we're
[1:33:33.080 --> 1:33:39.680]  in right now, is addiction was an opportunity, people don't look for hope unless things are
[1:33:39.680 --> 1:33:49.600]  bad, okay, so I look at addiction as an opportunity to bring people to God and to get them set
[1:33:49.600 --> 1:33:53.760]  free to restore their heart, but I'll tell you what, for the position we've been in
[1:33:53.760 --> 1:33:59.160]  now with this election and everybody, I don't care who you are, you're living in fear right
[1:33:59.160 --> 1:34:05.400]  now, there's a lot of fear, so this is where we're at, I really think that everybody, it's
[1:34:05.400 --> 1:34:10.920]  lifted everybody up and we all are getting involved in this now, we can't live in fear
[1:34:10.920 --> 1:34:15.920]  and there is no tomorrow, this is it right now everybody, we've all got to get engaged,
[1:34:15.920 --> 1:34:20.360]  we've all got to get on board, this election was fraudulent, it's going to get pulled down,
[1:34:20.360 --> 1:34:26.760]  if I ask you what you can do today, share that absolutely 9-0, share my movies everywhere,
[1:34:26.760 --> 1:34:32.000]  go to my new platform, frankspeech.com, watch the movies, share them everywhere, this is
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:36.440]  what you can do now and then we're going to have stuff you can do on the ground in every
[1:34:36.440 --> 1:34:41.720]  state, you go to frankspeech.com, you're going to learn what we can do, we have it all laid
[1:34:41.720 --> 1:34:46.960]  out, this amazing plan, but we've all got to do it because I'll tell you what, when
[1:34:46.960 --> 1:34:52.000]  we get way out here in the future and we get to this amazing place, we're going to look
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:58.720]  back and say all this had to happen in order to expose all this and expose all the corruption
[1:34:58.720 --> 1:35:03.360]  and the deep state and the communists and we're going to then once again be to this
[1:35:03.360 --> 1:35:08.240]  great place, you know, be the greatest uniting of our country ever and we will once again
[1:35:08.240 --> 1:35:14.320]  be one nation under God, I'll tell you, hold on, I 1 trillion billion percent agree, if
[1:35:14.320 --> 1:35:20.040]  we beat the globalists now with their radical race theory and all of this evil, if we beat
[1:35:20.040 --> 1:35:24.240]  them now, America is going to come together so beautifully and just a new golden age is
[1:35:24.240 --> 1:35:25.240]  going to start.
[1:35:25.240 --> 1:35:31.080]  Yep, yep, for sure, absolutely it is, I've been saying that and so I've been, I've been
[1:35:31.080 --> 1:35:37.440]  so, you know, people say, Mike, you're always optimistic, you guys got to go to frankspeech.com
[1:35:37.440 --> 1:35:42.480]  and get yourself some confidence, we have the, they're called packet abshers, you can't
[1:35:42.480 --> 1:35:48.120]  change this, they're not subjective, they are not subjective, so no matter who looks
[1:35:48.120 --> 1:35:53.080]  at them, you look at it and you're going to say, okay, 100 percent this happened, you
[1:35:53.080 --> 1:35:57.880]  know, you know, Alex, right now in our country, the more this is going on, the crazy stuff
[1:35:57.880 --> 1:36:04.520]  that's going on in Washington and these executive orders and all this stuff, more and more every
[1:36:04.520 --> 1:36:08.840]  day since we've been dropping these movies and everything, absolute proof, scientific
[1:36:08.840 --> 1:36:14.640]  proof, absolute interference, there's, if I heard the other day, it's like 80 percent
[1:36:14.640 --> 1:36:20.360]  of Republicans and like 30 percent of Democrats now believe that this election that it was
[1:36:20.360 --> 1:36:24.760]  that's right, more, this is key, when I was trying to get you on a month ago, this is
[1:36:24.760 --> 1:36:27.360]  what I want to have you on about, I'm glad you're here now, you reminded me without me
[1:36:27.360 --> 1:36:33.320]  talking to you, it was 70 percent of Republicans, 30 percent of Democrats, now it's almost 40
[1:36:33.320 --> 1:36:38.440]  percent Democrat, 80 percent of Republicans, so we're going on a curve, already the majority
[1:36:38.440 --> 1:36:43.360]  knows it was a fraud, to where a super majority knows, right, right, straight up, straight
[1:36:43.360 --> 1:36:47.920]  up and you know, I've got a lot of things planned where everybody can get involved in,
[1:36:47.920 --> 1:36:54.920]  I'll tell you the first one is this Saturday, this Saturday we're doing a rally, it's called
[1:36:54.920 --> 1:37:00.520]  a Frank rally, a free speech rally in Wisconsin and we've already got 20,000 people signed
[1:37:00.520 --> 1:37:07.440]  up and you get free tickets at frankspeech.com, our real president is going to speak there
[1:37:07.440 --> 1:37:12.880]  live from the jumbotron and we've got me, Diamond and Silk, our Charlie Kirk, Dinesh
[1:37:12.880 --> 1:37:19.760]  and Sosa, many others and you go there, you can live, we're live streaming it from Frank,
[1:37:19.760 --> 1:37:24.440]  all the media is showing up, all the bad media, even the daily show is coming, they're all
[1:37:24.440 --> 1:37:28.800]  coming and they're going to try and make them, you know, do something bad just like Jimmy
[1:37:28.800 --> 1:37:32.760]  Kimmel did but we're going to come out, we need to get the word out and the word out
[1:37:32.760 --> 1:37:37.200]  and that's what this will do, the other thing I want to tell everybody that I've been doing,
[1:37:37.200 --> 1:37:42.720]  I've had teams of my own teams of cyber teams, we had these machines quite a while ago, they're
[1:37:42.720 --> 1:37:49.080]  going, you know, hey Dominion, we've had them, so we've done our own audits in different
[1:37:49.080 --> 1:37:54.760]  states and stuff and we're finding the same thing, it's across the board but I want to
[1:37:54.760 --> 1:37:59.400]  tell you this, I've had validators and validators that work for the government, they're called
[1:37:59.400 --> 1:38:06.080]  white hat hackers that 100% say this is 100% true, everywhere we go it's the same, now
[1:38:06.080 --> 1:38:10.120]  what we're going to do, what I'm going to do in, I'm announcing on your show right
[1:38:10.120 --> 1:38:18.120]  now as we speak, in July, I'm going to get a place, some big location, I don't get it.
[1:38:18.120 --> 1:38:22.160]  Mike Lindell, stay there, I got a, you know about TV radio, I got hard breaks, satellites,
[1:38:22.160 --> 1:38:25.760]  stay there, we'll come right back in a few minutes, I want to hear this big announcement,
[1:38:25.760 --> 1:38:29.400]  Mike Lindell folks, Mike's a man of action, people need to tune in right now, he's putting
[1:38:29.400 --> 1:38:32.880]  his money where his mouth is, everybody should tell their friends and family tune in now if
[1:38:32.880 --> 1:38:37.960]  you're watching this, visit tape video later from band.video or infowars.com or newswars.com
[1:38:37.960 --> 1:38:43.920]  or freeworldnews.com, share this live report, share the archive report, that's what Big
[1:38:43.920 --> 1:38:49.200]  Tech can't handle, Mike Lindell is on fire, mypilla.com, frankspeech.com, stay with us,
[1:38:49.200 --> 1:38:51.200]  we'll be right back.
[1:38:51.200 --> 1:38:57.800]  Again, I don't like to lecture people, I'm a very private person, but because of the
[1:38:57.800 --> 1:39:01.840]  globalist, their attack on humanity, I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public
[1:39:01.840 --> 1:39:07.080]  figure and we've given the globalist one hell of a run for their money because of God and
[1:39:07.080 --> 1:39:10.560]  I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day, but just give me
[1:39:10.560 --> 1:39:14.800]  a break, the Satanism's out in the open, I've always been a Christian, but now the fact
[1:39:14.800 --> 1:39:18.360]  that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear and I get it, a lot of you've been
[1:39:18.360 --> 1:39:23.360]  turned off by big churches, a lot of you've been turned off by the corrupt priest class
[1:39:23.360 --> 1:39:27.920]  system and I get it, me too, believe me, I'm one of them, but it's that relationship with
[1:39:27.920 --> 1:39:35.200]  God and just God's universe that God created that is so essential and God created the universe
[1:39:35.200 --> 1:39:38.920]  for us to have communion with God through and to have life and so that's what M-Full
[1:39:38.920 --> 1:39:42.520]  Wars is really all about, so thank you all for your word of mouth, thank you for spreading
[1:39:42.520 --> 1:39:46.200]  the word about M-Full Wars, and thank you for supporting us to keep us on air by visiting

[1:40:33.200 --> 1:40:55.920]  M-FullWarsStore.com is simply the best, M-FullWarsStore.com beats out all the rest, that's M-FullWarsStore.com.
[1:40:55.920 --> 1:40:59.840]  One of the most common questions I get on air but also off air when I'm just out and
[1:40:59.840 --> 1:41:06.200]  about is, Alex, what do I say to my family about the vaccines, how do I warn them?
[1:41:06.200 --> 1:41:10.680]  Well, the problem is there's so many problems with it, so many facts, it's the history of
[1:41:10.680 --> 1:41:15.400]  contaminated vaccines, the fact that they have liability protection in the US and Europe,
[1:41:15.400 --> 1:41:20.160]  the fact that they've been caught adding sterilants and cancer viruses and other things to vaccines
[1:41:20.160 --> 1:41:25.960]  and the whole history of secret experimentation on at-risk groups of poor blacks, poor whites,
[1:41:25.960 --> 1:41:30.560]  Native Americans, the list goes on and on, but what about the fact that Fauci testified
[1:41:30.560 --> 1:41:37.760]  to Congress and so did the head of the CDC in late May of 2021 that around half of the
[1:41:37.760 --> 1:41:42.880]  NIH CDC staff, medical doctors, neurologist, scientists have refused to take the vaccine
[1:41:42.880 --> 1:41:43.880]  until they get safe?
[1:41:43.880 --> 1:41:48.080]  Yeah, I think what half of the doctors are scared to take it, that's the same thing in
[1:41:48.080 --> 1:41:50.960]  the private practice, is out there, some more numbers, that that's not something I'm going
[1:41:50.960 --> 1:41:51.960]  to be taking.
[1:41:51.960 --> 1:41:52.960]  That's very, very simple.
[1:41:52.960 --> 1:41:53.960]  There's your answer.
[1:41:53.960 --> 1:42:01.520]  My enemies are your enemies, they're the globalists, they're the extremists, they're a consortium
[1:42:01.520 --> 1:42:06.960]  of bad scientists, pedophiles, control freaks, devil worshipers, vampires, wherever you want
[1:42:06.960 --> 1:42:13.840]  to call them, that are highly predatory and are setting up a false famously land system
[1:42:13.840 --> 1:42:20.840]  of constant bombardment of propaganda, drugs and electromagnetic radiation to change the
[1:42:20.840 --> 1:42:27.560]  very DNA of the human species to mutate us into a form that they can control like a pawn
[1:42:27.560 --> 1:42:28.560]  on a chessboard.
[1:42:28.560 --> 1:42:34.520]  The bottom line is they want to play God, they are playing God, and the news is only
[1:42:34.520 --> 1:42:36.920]  going to tie it around our necks from here on out.
[1:42:36.920 --> 1:42:40.920]  So many other people want to be positive, they want to put out fake news and want to
[1:42:40.920 --> 1:42:44.720]  only cover limited amounts of what's happening with the World Order, but at the end of the
[1:42:44.720 --> 1:42:48.040]  day it's all about the population, it's all about world government, it's all about the
[1:42:48.040 --> 1:42:52.600]  end of the human system as we know it, and on its ashes a nightmare being built only
[1:42:52.600 --> 1:42:58.840]  admitting it can turn around and stop it.
[1:42:58.840 --> 1:43:08.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:43:08.320 --> 1:43:21.320]  All right, final segment with Mike Lindell in my next hour's a ton of news clips, your
[1:43:21.320 --> 1:43:23.640]  calls Matt Bracken coming up and more.
[1:43:23.640 --> 1:43:30.280]  Mike Lindell is here and he's the man in the arena that Teddy Roosevelt talked about, he's
[1:43:30.280 --> 1:43:34.440]  got huge announcements to make in the next five, six months we've got left on his busy
[1:43:34.440 --> 1:43:36.360]  schedule, a man in the arena.
[1:43:36.360 --> 1:43:40.960]  So we were going to break, you got a big announcement, what is the big announcement?
[1:43:40.960 --> 1:43:47.320]  Yeah, well this is just part of the plan, but the big announcement is if all the cyber
[1:43:47.320 --> 1:43:52.000]  evidence I have, all the stuff from the day before the election, the election, the two
[1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:57.880]  days after, all those packet, they're called packet captures everybody, since I went public
[1:43:57.880 --> 1:44:05.400]  with that and absolutely 9-0, I got all kinds of companies from all over the United States,
[1:44:05.400 --> 1:44:10.360]  cyber companies that are cyber white hat hackers, cyber companies saying, hey, we'd like to
[1:44:10.360 --> 1:44:12.400]  look at that and validate that.
[1:44:12.400 --> 1:44:17.600]  So what I'm going to do sometime in July, I'm going to get a, I don't care if it's US
[1:44:17.600 --> 1:44:23.320]  Bank Stadium, I don't care how big it has to be, I'm going to invite all of these white
[1:44:23.320 --> 1:44:30.880]  cyber experts in and I want to televised, all of them can be there, the whole world
[1:44:30.880 --> 1:44:34.800]  can watch and I don't care if there's a hundred of these companies there.
[1:44:34.800 --> 1:44:41.480]  There it is, and I want them all to say on TV and everywhere, wow, there it is, 100%,
[1:44:41.480 --> 1:44:45.880]  there it is, there it is, it's like showing a royal flush in a poker game and everyone
[1:44:45.880 --> 1:44:51.240]  going, does everybody see it, hello, that election is coming down and I want to tell
[1:44:51.240 --> 1:44:56.160]  you we're doing that and then I've been going to different states, I have teams of lawyers
[1:44:56.160 --> 1:45:02.680]  in different states, what we're doing is we're getting states on board and now remember
[1:45:02.680 --> 1:45:08.840]  this is all separate from all the audits going on in like America, Copacabana and all these
[1:45:08.840 --> 1:45:14.400]  other states, we're starting the ones in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
[1:45:14.400 --> 1:45:18.920]  But this case that my case that I've said, talked about all along, you've all heard about
[1:45:18.920 --> 1:45:23.240]  it, you've got to keep telling people about it, telling people to watch absolute proof,
[1:45:23.240 --> 1:45:28.360]  absolute interference, absolutely 9-0, send them to Frank's speech over and over to watch
[1:45:28.360 --> 1:45:29.360]  these things.
[1:45:29.360 --> 1:45:34.400]  Now, the pressure then on the Supreme Court, we're going to take this case, probably about
[1:45:34.400 --> 1:45:39.800]  the end of July and we're going to drop it on the Supreme Court's doorstep and by that
[1:45:39.800 --> 1:45:44.720]  time, all of us in this country have told all our friends, we've already seen all the
[1:45:44.720 --> 1:45:49.760]  evidence everybody, oh, it's a matter of the Supreme Court has to say yes, we will look
[1:45:49.760 --> 1:45:54.960]  at it, it's called a quoll warranty, that's legal talk, that's what this, that's what
[1:45:54.960 --> 1:45:59.720]  people take this down, a quoll warranty, that's the legal thing we're serving them and now
[1:45:59.720 --> 1:46:05.040]  all the evidence will be right there, it'll be a lot more than I served last week to Dominion.
[1:46:05.040 --> 1:46:09.680]  We have people that were on the inside, we have witnesses, we have whistleblowers, we
[1:46:09.680 --> 1:46:17.760]  have it all but more importantly, we have the site or the packet, the packet cyber footprints,
[1:46:17.760 --> 1:46:23.640]  these packet captures and when they see them, all nine of them justices are going to say
[1:46:23.640 --> 1:46:28.600]  bring the selection down and everyone's going to say come on Mike, they denied it before,
[1:46:28.600 --> 1:46:34.280]  they denied it before, well before they denied it, they didn't have this evidence for one
[1:46:34.280 --> 1:46:38.920]  thing when they brought this case to the Supreme Court, they didn't have this evidence and
[1:46:38.920 --> 1:46:43.080]  that was on procedure, they voted seven to two not to look at it, that's actually going
[1:46:43.080 --> 1:46:48.240]  to help us everybody because back then, the Democrats really thought they would, well
[1:46:48.240 --> 1:46:52.720]  now the Democrats are realizing no, we did win and we don't want what's in office, we
[1:46:52.720 --> 1:46:55.040]  don't want communism in our country.
[1:46:55.040 --> 1:47:00.880]  So these nine justices everybody, they are people too, they have children, they have
[1:47:00.880 --> 1:47:06.560]  grandchildren, they grew up here, the American dream, they've lived the American dream, I've
[1:47:06.560 --> 1:47:12.160]  lived the American dream, they don't want this gone forever, the American dream and
[1:47:12.160 --> 1:47:16.080]  they have neighbors, they have friends, if your friends are a neighbor of one of these
[1:47:16.080 --> 1:47:20.600]  Supreme Court justices, tell them to go to Frank's Beach, watch the evidence, tell them
[1:47:20.600 --> 1:47:26.040]  to watch absolutely 9-0, so by the time this gets to them, they just go quick, bring it
[1:47:26.040 --> 1:47:31.480]  in here, we got to bring this down, you guys, we're in a race against time here, our country
[1:47:31.480 --> 1:47:37.000]  is getting destroyed by communism, by taking away our First Amendment right to free speech
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:41.280]  and attacking our country and then we got this case, we're going here and everyone says
[1:47:41.280 --> 1:47:46.600]  well Mike, why don't you bring it to them right now, because this is a marketing thing
[1:47:46.600 --> 1:47:50.800]  for everybody, everyone in this country has got to see the evidence, so we basically are
[1:47:50.800 --> 1:47:51.800]  trying to get out here.
[1:47:51.800 --> 1:47:53.640]  Exactly, if you release something too quick and it has no effect, you've got to build
[1:47:53.640 --> 1:47:54.640]  it up.
[1:47:54.640 --> 1:47:57.720]  That's right, that's exactly right, amen.
[1:47:57.720 --> 1:48:01.200]  I've learned that I've made some huge news, nobody cares, but I've built it up for a week
[1:48:01.200 --> 1:48:03.840]  or two or a month, then it has an effect.
[1:48:03.840 --> 1:48:08.200]  Yep, absolutely, because you know what, the whole world is watching, I have had countries
[1:48:08.200 --> 1:48:13.120]  reach out to me and go, you know what, we got these machines too, we got them in 19,
[1:48:13.120 --> 1:48:17.480]  they're going to take more countries than just the U.S., communism is coming everywhere,
[1:48:17.480 --> 1:48:21.480]  they skip right over socialism and right to communism.
[1:48:21.480 --> 1:48:25.960]  Let me throw this at you, I'm talking to a lot of people, as you said, Democrats who
[1:48:25.960 --> 1:48:31.000]  say oh we know Trump really won, I mean even the mayor of New York's daughter says yeah
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:35.840]  we know that Biden stole it, and so you're right, there's major remorse that he's in
[1:48:35.840 --> 1:48:39.960]  there, even though they know it's fraud, there's major remorse, you're absolutely right, I
[1:48:39.960 --> 1:48:44.760]  would see headlines as CNN, oh democracy in peril because of Michael and Dell and Trump,
[1:48:44.760 --> 1:48:52.040]  oh no, and then weird statements by deputy FBI directors about trying to arrest people,
[1:48:52.040 --> 1:48:55.600]  they're really scared, if they really won the election, they wouldn't be so scared,
[1:48:55.600 --> 1:48:57.960]  they wouldn't be trying to block these audits.
[1:48:57.960 --> 1:49:03.800]  100% for sure, they've been trying to block the audits and you know, let's just tell everyone,
[1:49:03.800 --> 1:49:08.360]  this is communism coming in, it doesn't matter what party you're in, let's look at a couple
[1:49:08.360 --> 1:49:13.960]  of crooked Republicans, Brian Kemp and Doug Ducey, two governors, Republican governors,
[1:49:13.960 --> 1:49:18.520]  Arizona and Georgia, those two governors have been the biggest obstructionists in their
[1:49:18.520 --> 1:49:24.000]  states for these audits, I don't know, are they in on it, hello, that's the deviation,
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:28.080]  you would have said a long time ago, let's look at this, I mean this goes cross parties
[1:49:28.080 --> 1:49:32.400]  and everything, and it's all getting exposed, and taking it down, we gotta get our country
[1:49:32.400 --> 1:49:37.280]  back, and then all these people that were in on it, from your Jack Dorsey's to your
[1:49:37.280 --> 1:49:41.760]  Mark Suckabuck, all of these people are in on it, yeah, look at them two governors, there
[1:49:41.760 --> 1:49:47.440]  you go, they should be, I, both of them should be brought to justice, you know, they kicked
[1:49:47.440 --> 1:49:52.440]  me out of the G, the governor's association, I was invited down to Tennessee, I don't know
[1:49:52.440 --> 1:49:57.040]  if this made the news or not, I think it did, but I got down there to go to the governor's
[1:49:57.040 --> 1:50:00.520]  dinner and Ducey and Kemp says, no, you're not coming, because they knew I was gonna
[1:50:00.520 --> 1:50:01.520]  follow along.
[1:50:01.520 --> 1:50:06.720]  No, it didn't make the news, they're so scared of the spotlight on what they're doing,
[1:50:06.720 --> 1:50:10.720]  Mike Lindell, I've always loved watching you, and since you got involved in politics, love
[1:50:10.720 --> 1:50:13.920]  what you were saying and doing, but you're a real hero now, because you have been the
[1:50:13.920 --> 1:50:19.240]  man in the arena, you are doing an incredible job, everybody needs to pray, that's the number
[1:50:19.240 --> 1:50:23.800]  one thing for Mike Lindell, and everything he's doing.
[1:50:23.800 --> 1:50:28.760]  Yeah, thank you, and I thank everybody for your prayers, and I believe, I do believe
[1:50:28.760 --> 1:50:32.400]  that we're in the greatest revival ever, people aren't looking for hope and those things
[1:50:32.400 --> 1:50:33.400]  are bad.
[1:50:33.400 --> 1:50:37.040]  If we get through this, it's gonna be once again one nation under God, but it's the
[1:50:37.040 --> 1:50:42.840]  biggest revival for Jesus in history, everybody right now is just there praying, and we are,
[1:50:42.840 --> 1:50:47.560]  our prayers are answered, they have been answered over and over here, remember, God's got His
[1:50:47.560 --> 1:50:52.200]  hand in all of this, this is on God's timing, can you imagine if this would have been flipped
[1:50:52.200 --> 1:50:57.800]  back in December, you might have had a, you know, Democrats not believing that they really,
[1:50:57.800 --> 1:51:02.440]  that it really got stole, well now, when the Supreme Court pulls this down, those nine
[1:51:02.440 --> 1:51:07.560]  Supreme Court justices are gonna be heroes, they're protecting our country from China,
[1:51:07.560 --> 1:51:09.960]  and whether you're a Democrat or a Republican, it's gonna be a U-90.
[1:51:09.960 --> 1:51:14.640]  No, I agree, and as long as your message gets out, we win, and just like you said, and I
[1:51:14.640 --> 1:51:19.800]  believe this may happen like you're saying, but regardless, it's like Jackson won, they
[1:51:19.800 --> 1:51:24.600]  stole and he got even bigger four years later, I mean, I hope it's right away, but regardless,
[1:51:24.600 --> 1:51:28.480]  he runs with a speakership, we have a huge Republican takeover of the House and Senate
[1:51:28.480 --> 1:51:33.840]  with that zombie, all I know is not fighting, we lose, fighting, we win, Mike Lindell, my
[1:51:33.840 --> 1:51:38.000]  pillow, an American success story, I look forward to speaking to you again, we salute
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:41.520]  you, your big rally's coming up, where, where do people go to that?
[1:51:41.520 --> 1:51:47.160]  That's in Wisconsin, it's this Saturday, everybody can go get free tickets at prankspeech.com,
[1:51:47.160 --> 1:51:52.320]  the president's gonna, our real president's gonna speak by the jumbotron, and I'm speaking,
[1:51:52.320 --> 1:51:56.360]  we have many great speakers, it's a five-hour festival, it is amazing.
[1:51:56.360 --> 1:51:57.920]  Beautiful, Mike, I know.
[1:51:57.920 --> 1:52:01.720]  Watch it, watch it, live stream, everybody, I want to say one more quick thing when you
[1:52:01.720 --> 1:52:07.920]  talk about elections coming up, remember this, through all of this, there can never be machines
[1:52:07.920 --> 1:52:12.440]  in this country again, there's a reason that, there's a reason Brian Kemp bought a hundred
[1:52:12.440 --> 1:52:20.680]  and seven million dollars worth in 2019, those machines have to go or we will never have
[1:52:20.680 --> 1:52:24.640]  another fair election, that, that's gonna happen for sure, everybody, we're gonna tell
[1:52:24.640 --> 1:52:26.440]  you how you can go to your own district.
[1:52:26.440 --> 1:52:30.760]  Everybody just killed HR one, thanks to you and Trump and everybody, we, we just killed
[1:52:30.760 --> 1:52:34.640]  HR one, they're taken, they're fraudulent takeover, so, damn right, America's the middle
[1:52:34.640 --> 1:52:38.520]  of the fight, Mike, Mike Lindell, we'll talk to you soon, thank you sir.
[1:52:38.520 --> 1:52:41.040]  I bless y'all, thank you, thanks for having me, Alex.
[1:52:41.040 --> 1:52:46.880]  Wow, wow, man, I tell you, Mike Lindell is, is in fuego, in fuego, in fuego, how do you
[1:52:46.880 --> 1:52:47.880]  say that in Spanish?
[1:52:47.880 --> 1:52:52.960]  Like the fire is on fire, anybody ever say that in Spanish, the fire is on fire?
[1:52:52.960 --> 1:52:55.960]  The cream of the cream, you got the cream of the cream at the fire of the fire, I'm
[1:52:55.960 --> 1:52:58.680]  inventing words here now, but that's what this is.
[1:52:58.680 --> 1:53:02.200]  I sense a victory if we just keep taking action.
[1:53:02.200 --> 1:53:06.480]  I told you Q was gonna screw us and I told you Trump was having a stolen, but now I'm
[1:53:06.480 --> 1:53:10.800]  sensing victory if we get really upset and angry and wake up to the vaccine, wake up
[1:53:10.800 --> 1:53:14.960]  to the lies and everything, we can do it, but Trump can't lead it, folks, we've got
[1:53:14.960 --> 1:53:24.800]  to lead it, he'll ride it on the surfboard on top of it, all right, our number three
[1:53:24.800 --> 1:53:35.960]  fight, it's coming up, so much next hour, so much to cover, oh, I forgot, Roger Stone
[1:53:35.960 --> 1:53:44.680]  with major breaking news, as I told you, the third hour, coming up.
[1:53:44.680 --> 1:53:51.120]  The equation is very simple, the mega banks control the media, they control big pharma,
[1:53:51.120 --> 1:53:58.240]  they control academia, they control the military, industrial complex, they control big tech,
[1:53:58.240 --> 1:54:03.680]  and everywhere that they have been in control in the third world they have established absolute
[1:54:03.680 --> 1:54:10.680]  total despotism and de-immunization, it is the western Christian idea of human freedom
[1:54:10.680 --> 1:54:14.960]  that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens
[1:54:14.960 --> 1:54:21.080]  them, so because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opted, turned it up
[1:54:21.080 --> 1:54:28.080]  upside down and used the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the
[1:54:28.080 --> 1:54:32.840]  free market that threatens their monopolies of control, that's why they target info wars
[1:54:32.840 --> 1:54:37.440]  because we understand the keys to defeating them, but the only way our transmission gets
[1:54:37.440 --> 1:54:42.640]  out is if you promote info wars and ban that video, so we double your efforts, we're all
[1:54:42.640 --> 1:54:45.680]  on this together.
[1:54:45.680 --> 1:54:52.360]  Big pharma was born out of the Rockefeller oil industry in 1900 with the petrochemical,
[1:54:52.360 --> 1:54:58.760]  the petrochemical then dominated two major industries, plastics and drugs, companies
[1:54:58.760 --> 1:55:05.280]  began synthesizing patented versions of naturally sourced drugs, the natural sources were then
[1:55:05.280 --> 1:55:11.520]  made illegal, pharmaceuticals became medicine, and the sicker people got the more their industry
[1:55:11.520 --> 1:55:17.840]  grew, it's a death cult and it's up to the individual to escape, good health begins with
[1:55:17.840 --> 1:55:24.120]  a healthy immune system, which needs the proper nutrients to thrive, nutrients we cannot readily
[1:55:24.120 --> 1:55:30.720]  get from our food today, the combinations of vitamin C and zinc and vitamin D3 with calcium
[1:55:30.720 --> 1:55:37.400]  have been proven to be what we need to maintain a healthy immune system, go to infowarstore.com
[1:55:37.400 --> 1:55:42.880]  and start supporting your natural immune system now with the mega immune support pack, now
[1:55:42.880 --> 1:55:48.360]  40% off.
[1:55:48.360 --> 1:56:08.480]  Start listening to the alex jones show.
[1:56:08.480 --> 1:56:25.560]  We'll talk about that next segment.
[1:56:25.560 --> 1:56:32.520]  Joining us is Roger Stone on Trump coming out saying soon Biden will be gone, what was
[1:56:32.520 --> 1:56:36.240]  that cryptic talk, we'll talk about it next segment, we'll get into all this, but Roger
[1:56:36.240 --> 1:56:41.160]  first you've got some good news about your awesome wife.
[1:56:41.160 --> 1:56:45.400]  Absolutely alex, I want to break it right here at the alex jones show, I'm happy to
[1:56:45.400 --> 1:56:52.320]  report that mrs. Stone is out of the hospital, her pneumonia which was compounding her treatment
[1:56:52.320 --> 1:56:59.440]  is now resolved, she's in great fighting spirits, and look I just want to thank the literally
[1:56:59.440 --> 1:57:05.560]  at this point I think millions of people praying for us, those who have donated to our family
[1:57:05.560 --> 1:57:10.240]  fund to support her cancer treatments, I don't need to tell you alex, we were wiped out by
[1:57:10.240 --> 1:57:16.040]  robert moeller and his inquisition, all of this stuff is really expensive, but prayer
[1:57:16.040 --> 1:57:21.200]  has been the key, there's just no question about that, prayer chains around the world,
[1:57:21.200 --> 1:57:30.040]  prayer chains in israel, prayer trains trails all over the country, you could feel the power
[1:57:30.040 --> 1:57:38.400]  of christ, and she's resilient, she's in great spirits, she is resolved to beat this, so
[1:57:38.400 --> 1:57:45.560]  I just want to say a giant thank you to everybody in the infowars staff, everybody in the infowars
[1:57:45.560 --> 1:57:52.480]  community, patriots around the globe who have contributed to today's progress in her fight
[1:57:52.480 --> 1:57:53.480]  against cancer.
[1:57:53.480 --> 1:58:00.040]  Well roger we talk about this, you become like a prize, the globalists want to capture,
[1:58:00.040 --> 1:58:04.800]  why do they hate us so much, just the minions?
[1:58:04.800 --> 1:58:09.000]  Well I think it's because we're truth tellers, I mean at a time that the mainstream media
[1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:16.280]  is suppressing all of the information regarding anomalies and irregularities in the 2020 election,
[1:58:16.280 --> 1:58:23.520]  at a time when the justice department has the record number of warrantless surveillances
[1:58:23.520 --> 1:58:28.440]  going on of American citizens, at a time that they appear, in the case of Rudy Giuliani,
[1:58:28.440 --> 1:58:33.720]  to essentially trying to jail their political adversaries, some of you would see in the
[1:58:33.720 --> 1:58:40.200]  Soviet Union or China, but not really in the tradition of American democracy, anyone who
[1:58:40.200 --> 1:58:46.440]  is a truth teller, whether it is Laura Loomer who broke big news today about Bill Gates
[1:58:46.440 --> 1:58:54.200]  subsidies to the Palm Beach County director, pardon me, the supervisor of elections, which
[1:58:54.200 --> 1:58:58.520]  was not publicly disclosed, eight million dollars I believe, or whether it's the Alex
[1:58:58.520 --> 1:59:04.200]  Jones show, or whether it's Tucker Carlson who is a beacon of truth every single night
[1:59:04.200 --> 1:59:08.440]  of the week and weekdays, they hate us because they ain't us.
[1:59:08.440 --> 1:59:12.800]  They hate us because we have the courage to tell the truth.
[1:59:12.800 --> 1:59:17.160]  And as you know, sunlight is an antidote for corruption.
[1:59:17.160 --> 1:59:22.600]  They're the ones who say democracy dies in darkness, but they are the darkness.
[1:59:22.600 --> 1:59:26.720]  They're not interested in a debate, they're not interested in truth, they're not interested
[1:59:26.720 --> 1:59:34.240]  in dialogue, they're just interested in silencing anyone who disagrees with them.
[1:59:34.240 --> 1:59:38.920]  When you say that, it's so true, when you describe the Democrats as they really are
[1:59:38.920 --> 1:59:44.840]  the darkness, I mean, because the Washington Post is a headline, democracy dies in darkness.
[1:59:44.840 --> 1:59:47.000]  They're the ones silencing us, Roger.
[1:59:47.000 --> 1:59:50.640]  Well, look, this is very different than what we grew up with.
[1:59:50.640 --> 1:59:56.160]  There was a time when you had two major parties, both of whom loved America.
[1:59:56.160 --> 2:00:00.800]  I think John F. Kennedy in retrospect, I realized he was a great president.
[2:00:00.800 --> 2:00:03.480]  He wanted to return to a gold or silver back dollar.
[2:00:03.480 --> 2:00:09.120]  He had serious doubts about our intelligence agencies and their rogue operations.
[2:00:09.120 --> 2:00:12.960]  He wanted peace, and they didn't want peace.
[2:00:12.960 --> 2:00:17.240]  But there was a time when both parties just had two different governing philosophies, a
[2:00:17.240 --> 2:00:20.200]  more liberal philosophy, a more conservative philosophy.
[2:00:20.200 --> 2:00:25.720]  On finances, on fiscal matters, on foreign policy matters, this is no longer the case.
[2:00:25.720 --> 2:00:31.560]  You have one party that is the America first party under Donald Trump, and you have the
[2:00:31.560 --> 2:00:36.160]  other party that has been completely co-opted by the red Chinese.
[2:00:36.160 --> 2:00:38.680]  I think this is abundantly clear.
[2:00:38.680 --> 2:00:41.920]  Their party will not denounce radical Islam.
[2:00:41.920 --> 2:00:42.920]  Think about that.
[2:00:42.920 --> 2:00:48.400]  The party of Harry Truman, who is essentially the founder of the state of Israel, will not
[2:00:48.400 --> 2:00:51.560]  denounce radical Islam, will not denounce...
[2:00:51.560 --> 2:00:53.560]  Are there wrong things there?
[2:00:53.560 --> 2:00:54.560]  Yep.
[2:00:54.560 --> 2:00:59.920]  The entire new order system is about making you apathetic, making you feel weak, making
[2:00:59.920 --> 2:01:04.440]  you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being made the image
[2:01:04.440 --> 2:01:09.680]  of God, and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[2:01:09.680 --> 2:01:15.800]  Being given free will, being given consciousness, is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[2:01:15.800 --> 2:01:20.480]  an entire system, and the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact you're
[2:01:20.480 --> 2:01:24.960]  able to see the beauty of the sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty
[2:01:24.960 --> 2:01:30.080]  of your wife or your husband, or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty
[2:01:30.080 --> 2:01:31.080]  of music.
[2:01:31.080 --> 2:01:34.640]  The fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic, and that
[2:01:34.640 --> 2:01:38.480]  itself is what God teaches us, is worship.
[2:01:38.480 --> 2:01:42.640]  So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things of the
[2:01:42.640 --> 2:01:48.560]  system, but worship the things of God because we're made by God, and appreciate your consciousness,
[2:01:48.560 --> 2:02:14.360]  and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[2:02:14.360 --> 2:02:42.360]  We have three new products in stock that I wanted 16 months ago, but because of breakdowns
[2:02:42.360 --> 2:02:48.920]  of the supply chain, when you're getting high-end quality stuff, we didn't have it.
[2:02:48.920 --> 2:02:53.560]  But six months ago, things started to loosen up a bit, we were able to get the order in,
[2:02:53.560 --> 2:02:54.560]  and we got it.
[2:02:54.560 --> 2:02:59.000]  Three different products, introducing the brand new mega-immune support supplements.
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  What's beyond that?
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:04.120]  Your health, your stamina, your libido, your mental focus, everything.
[2:03:04.120 --> 2:03:09.920]  40% off when you get all three together, new enforce life, whole food multivitamin, it
[2:03:09.920 --> 2:03:14.920]  comes from plant-derived quality, it's not synthetic.
[2:03:14.920 --> 2:03:22.720]  Enforce life, vitamin C, 1100% or daily allowance with Sink and Rose Camps, that's 25% off.
[2:03:22.720 --> 2:03:28.640]  Enforce life, vitamin D3 with calcium that goes together, 25% off, all those, 40% off
[2:03:28.640 --> 2:03:32.880]  when you get the trifecta together.
[2:03:32.880 --> 2:03:37.240]  And in the end, they've got like some vegetables there, but really it should be like the molecular
[2:03:37.240 --> 2:03:40.400]  break down there because these are all high-end.
[2:03:40.400 --> 2:03:44.960]  I could get these for dollars a bottle, I don't.
[2:03:44.960 --> 2:03:49.160]  Way more than that because it's the highest grade, the highest quality.
[2:03:49.160 --> 2:03:53.280]  Even the crappy stuff works great because it's concentrated, this is next level, 40%
[2:03:53.280 --> 2:03:57.320]  off for all three, 25% off by themselves.
[2:03:57.320 --> 2:04:02.640]  Again, 16, 17 months trying to get this hand, we got it in with the highest quality, but
[2:04:02.640 --> 2:04:06.680]  it's great for children and great for young people, but if you're above 40, you really
[2:04:06.680 --> 2:04:10.800]  need a whole food multivitamin, you really need vitamin D3 with calcium, you need the
[2:04:10.800 --> 2:04:16.640]  big like Linus Pauling when a Nobel Prize for it in science and medicine, you recommended
[2:04:16.640 --> 2:04:23.840]  1100% of the daily allowance, well this is Linus Pauling's recommended vitamin C regimen
[2:04:23.840 --> 2:04:29.680]  with Sink and Rose Camps, that is the Linus Pauling formulae there, so that's like 50
[2:04:29.680 --> 2:04:34.360]  years old, nobody promotes that, but that's like the King Daddy, we brought it back in
[2:04:34.360 --> 2:04:48.120]  the vitamin D3, the whole food multivitamin, infowarstore.com or triple A 253-3139.
[2:04:48.120 --> 2:04:53.240]  Now I want to play a clip here for Roger Stone of Frank Thigliozzi, who is the deputy director
[2:04:53.240 --> 2:05:04.560]  of the FBI, the head of all this counter espionage operation, and he's joined Obama's frontman
[2:05:04.560 --> 2:05:12.400]  Biden, the Biden administration, Saki the press secretary, and all of them saying anybody
[2:05:12.400 --> 2:05:17.960]  that promotes election investigation as a terrorist is an insider, anyone that incites
[2:05:17.960 --> 2:05:22.840]  questioning the government should be frustrated, should be interdicted, should be shut down,
[2:05:22.840 --> 2:05:27.120]  those are all counter terrorism terms, by the Pentagon, by the CIA, I mean this is like
[2:05:27.120 --> 2:05:33.240]  martial law taught, yeah there it is, even Yahoo News, former assistant FBI director
[2:05:33.240 --> 2:05:38.080]  suggests congressmen, Trump officials, should be arrested for capital riot, he didn't suggest
[2:05:38.080 --> 2:05:44.160]  that he said, they're a speed bump to arresting them because they criticize the election,
[2:05:44.160 --> 2:05:49.480]  that means you're a terrorist, so this is turning the apparatus of counter terrorism
[2:05:49.480 --> 2:05:53.640]  on the American people, and Roger Stone earlier mentioned that, he just joined us, they've
[2:05:53.640 --> 2:06:01.120]  got unlimited numbers of illegal warrants out, doing this by naming us just like we were
[2:06:01.120 --> 2:06:08.000]  Russians before, nobody bought that so now we're terrorists today, so here he is making
[2:06:08.000 --> 2:06:11.640]  this incredible statement which is really part of the course, here it is.
[2:06:11.640 --> 2:06:16.480]  Chris Ray testified publicly on the Hill that what happened on January 6th is domestic terrorism,
[2:06:16.480 --> 2:06:20.400]  what have we learned from our experience with international terrorism, in order to address
[2:06:20.400 --> 2:06:26.760]  that problem, arresting low level operatives is merely a speed bump, not a road block,
[2:06:26.760 --> 2:06:31.440]  in order to really tackle terrorism in this time domestically, you've got to attack and
[2:06:31.440 --> 2:06:37.480]  dismantle the command and control element of a terrorist group, and unfortunately, and
[2:06:37.480 --> 2:06:43.000]  I know this is painful to hear, that may mean people sitting in congress right now, people
[2:06:43.000 --> 2:06:48.680]  in and around the former president, that's how you do this, otherwise recruitment, inciting
[2:06:48.680 --> 2:06:56.640]  and cult-like leadership continues to recruit people to violence.
[2:06:56.640 --> 2:06:58.720]  G. Roger, wonder who he's talking about?
[2:06:58.720 --> 2:07:03.760]  Yeah, I mean, first of all, I guess he's unfamiliar with the First Amendment of the United States
[2:07:03.760 --> 2:07:09.840]  Constitution, that's the one that allows anyone to question the anomalies or the irregularities
[2:07:09.840 --> 2:07:15.240]  in the last elections, there is nobody yelling fire in a crowded theater, now he is right,
[2:07:15.240 --> 2:07:22.200]  there are people who should be swept up, John Brennan, Andrew McCabe, James Comey, General
[2:07:22.200 --> 2:07:27.280]  Mattis, these people are actively involved in a treasonous act in which they use the
[2:07:27.280 --> 2:07:33.240]  full authority of the United States government in a bogus investigation, we know this for
[2:07:33.240 --> 2:07:40.200]  certainty because the documents that were declassified by Rick Grinnell, who was then the acting director
[2:07:40.200 --> 2:07:45.640]  of national intelligence, a true patriot in my view, that demonstrated the entire Mueller
[2:07:45.640 --> 2:07:51.840]  witch hunt was a fraud, and that they essentially were covering up their use of the intelligence
[2:07:51.840 --> 2:07:57.720]  agencies to spy on the Republican candidate for president and his staff during the election,
[2:07:57.720 --> 2:08:01.720]  and particularly after the election during the presidential transition.
[2:08:01.720 --> 2:08:07.040]  Now as you remember, Alex, that's what they drove Richard Nixon out of office for, the
[2:08:07.040 --> 2:08:12.800]  break in at the Watergate headquarters, which was in fact a small group of private citizens
[2:08:12.800 --> 2:08:19.240]  who were misguided freaks, this is the full use of the intelligence system of the intelligence
[2:08:19.240 --> 2:08:24.800]  authorities to spy on the Republican candidate for president, this is the greatest abuse
[2:08:24.800 --> 2:08:29.440]  of power in American history, so how is that, what's the best way to conceal this, what's
[2:08:29.440 --> 2:08:37.760]  the best way to change the subject, oh, anyone who exercises their constitutional right to
[2:08:37.760 --> 2:08:43.720]  question the irregularities in the last election, the fact that some precincts in Philadelphia,
[2:08:43.720 --> 2:08:49.880]  more people voted than are registered to vote, for example, or that they've put out 1.4 million
[2:08:49.880 --> 2:08:55.120]  absentee ballot applications and they got 2.2 million dot back.
[2:08:55.120 --> 2:09:03.240]  No one is defending those who called for violence or lawlessness, we have not done that, but
[2:09:03.240 --> 2:09:09.040]  to term anyone who exercises their free speech rights as a terrorist is outrageous.
[2:09:09.040 --> 2:09:14.400]  And Rodgers, you just said it, they've illegally spotted the president as a candidate, as president
[2:09:14.400 --> 2:09:17.840]  elect, as president, they got caught, now they're going to go to jail for that, so they're
[2:09:17.840 --> 2:09:22.160]  externalizing and saying of course we spy on all the American people, it's totally normal.
[2:09:22.160 --> 2:09:29.520]  Well, in fact, this last week, this effort to kneecap General Michael Flynn, Flynn made
[2:09:29.520 --> 2:09:35.400]  a lame joke about a coup and they immediately wanted him court-martialed, they wanted him
[2:09:35.400 --> 2:09:41.200]  arrested, well, General Mattis actually participated in an illegal coup.
[2:09:41.200 --> 2:09:46.920]  I would remind you that Rod Rosenstein, the acting attorney general when it came to Russian
[2:09:46.920 --> 2:09:52.440]  Congress, wore a wire trying to entrap the president of the United States in a 26th
[2:09:52.440 --> 2:09:59.480]  amendment plot, denied it vehemently before Congress, denied it vehemently to the president's
[2:09:59.480 --> 2:10:03.520]  face, denied it in the media, and right after the election of Joe Biden, he made it, yeah,
[2:10:03.520 --> 2:10:05.400]  it was true, I definitely did it.
[2:10:05.400 --> 2:10:10.520]  So they are the lawless ones, they are the ones who have no regard for the Constitution,
[2:10:10.520 --> 2:10:16.880]  they are the ones who have so far swerved an investigation into their treasonous activities.
[2:10:16.880 --> 2:10:17.880]  Mr. Duro.
[2:10:17.880 --> 2:10:21.920]  It's all because of blackmail like Mattis for his sexual activities.
[2:10:21.920 --> 2:10:25.520]  So Roger, where does all this go?
[2:10:25.520 --> 2:10:30.040]  Well the sad part is, I think as long as you have a mainstream media censorship and control
[2:10:30.040 --> 2:10:36.120]  of all mass communications in the United States, it's hard to know where it controls.
[2:10:36.120 --> 2:10:39.400]  The American people are being buffaloed about the facts.
[2:10:39.400 --> 2:10:44.800]  January 6th, they're totally the most deadly attack on America since 9-11, except for the
[2:10:44.800 --> 2:10:49.120]  only person who died, Ashley Babbitt, was an unarmed woman.
[2:10:49.120 --> 2:10:54.080]  Trespassing does not excuse you from first-degree murder, but we're told the investigation's
[2:10:54.080 --> 2:10:58.920]  over, they're not going to name the person who shot her, but he's not going to be prosecuted.
[2:10:58.920 --> 2:11:03.720]  Meanwhile, they try to push again the fake narrative that two Capitol Hill police officers
[2:11:03.720 --> 2:11:08.680]  died in the mail, when in fact they denied, they died afterwards, and there doesn't seem
[2:11:08.680 --> 2:11:11.960]  to be any connection to the events at the Capitol.
[2:11:11.960 --> 2:11:14.200]  Look, we renounce what happened at the Capitol.
[2:11:14.200 --> 2:11:17.320]  We did it at the time, we did it immediately.
[2:11:17.320 --> 2:11:21.800]  Do find it suspicious that the Secret Service wanted to escort me up to the Capitol and
[2:11:21.800 --> 2:11:26.920]  I decided to stay in my hotel, that the Secret Service contacted you, the Secret Service doesn't
[2:11:26.920 --> 2:11:27.920]  do those things.
[2:11:27.920 --> 2:11:34.400]  They don't do political chores, but their entire false narrative which continues every
[2:11:34.400 --> 2:11:35.400]  day.
[2:11:35.400 --> 2:11:39.000]  They were buttering us up to be set up, not the whole Secret Service, but those special
[2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:40.000]  political operatives.
[2:11:40.000 --> 2:11:45.200]  Roger Stone, stay there, tomorrow's news today, Roger Stone on the Alice Jones Show Live,

[2:13:00.320 --> 2:13:03.520]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[2:13:03.520 --> 2:13:06.600]  The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they
[2:13:06.600 --> 2:13:07.920]  can to shut us down.
[2:13:07.920 --> 2:13:12.240]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air and please support the local station you're

[2:13:24.240 --> 2:13:25.720]  in the face of this thing.
[2:13:25.720 --> 2:13:27.840]  I need your help more than ever now.
[2:13:27.840 --> 2:13:32.160]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[2:13:32.160 --> 2:13:37.560]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great

[2:14:55.920 --> 2:15:15.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:15:15.400 --> 2:15:26.960]  I was looking at all the lights, there were plants and birds and rocks and things, there
[2:15:26.960 --> 2:15:27.960]  were sands and hills and rains.
[2:15:27.960 --> 2:15:36.960]  The first thing I met was a flower with a buzz and a sky with no clouds.
[2:15:36.960 --> 2:15:41.960]  The heat was hot and the ground was dry but the air was full of sound.
[2:15:41.960 --> 2:15:51.600]  I've been through the desert on a horse with no name, it felt good to be out of the rain.
[2:15:51.600 --> 2:15:56.240]  Roger Stone's here and I've got some ultra massive, it's all ultra massive.
[2:15:56.240 --> 2:15:58.360]  This is really big.
[2:15:58.360 --> 2:16:01.960]  Vaccine and oscillation news that Roger and I were already planning to talk about but
[2:16:01.960 --> 2:16:08.160]  Biden just made some very cryptic statements that we'll be covering next segment and I'll
[2:16:08.160 --> 2:16:09.960]  add it together with the other dots here.
[2:16:09.960 --> 2:16:16.520]  But Roger, getting back to the tone deaf corporate media with almost no ratings or viewers, no
[2:16:16.520 --> 2:16:17.520]  one's buying it.
[2:16:17.520 --> 2:16:23.840]  Polls show 80% of Republicans in the election stolen, 40% of Democrats, that was 10 points
[2:16:23.840 --> 2:16:26.800]  lower a month ago, it's all sliding that way.
[2:16:26.800 --> 2:16:30.680]  Biden's turning the power off, the pipelines opening the borders, the Mexican president
[2:16:30.680 --> 2:16:36.520]  says Biden's bad, the Guatemalan president says he's bad, Biden can barely talk, inflation's
[2:16:36.520 --> 2:16:37.520]  rearing.
[2:16:37.520 --> 2:16:42.280]  It's head, I mean, talk about buyer's remorse, well he didn't win the election, we didn't
[2:16:42.280 --> 2:16:47.080]  buy Biden but so it's beyond buyer's remorse, where do you see this going, what do you
[2:16:47.080 --> 2:16:53.240]  see unfolding right now because it just seems like the whole Biden administration is a dumpster
[2:16:53.240 --> 2:16:54.240]  fire.
[2:16:54.240 --> 2:17:00.800]  Well first of all I think the illegitimacy of it is likely to get expanded meaning we
[2:17:00.800 --> 2:17:07.400]  know that delegations from Georgia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania have gone to Arizona to examine
[2:17:07.400 --> 2:17:12.360]  what they're doing there in a comprehensive forensic recount.
[2:17:12.360 --> 2:17:18.840]  The question of course becomes that even if we get absolute indisputable proof that the
[2:17:18.840 --> 2:17:25.760]  election was stolen through irregularities and anomalies and fraud, what is the mechanism
[2:17:25.760 --> 2:17:26.760]  to change things?
[2:17:26.760 --> 2:17:31.440]  I mean look, I have a high regard for Mike Lindell, I think he's doing the Lord's work
[2:17:31.440 --> 2:17:37.080]  and I know he's working very hard to undercover election fraud, I just wonder where is the
[2:17:37.080 --> 2:17:43.080]  precedent to reverse the electoral college vote that may have wrongly seated Joe Biden.
[2:17:43.080 --> 2:17:48.280]  Now just the fact that I said that I will now be attacked as a conspiracy theorist, maybe
[2:17:48.280 --> 2:17:54.080]  even a domestic terrorist, no I'm just exercising my free speech rights, please read the First
[2:17:54.080 --> 2:17:56.320]  Amendment of the Constitution.
[2:17:56.320 --> 2:18:02.160]  I'm not saying he should be forcibly or violently removed, I'm saying what is the legal mechanism
[2:18:02.160 --> 2:18:05.320]  that exists when you have indisputed fraud.
[2:18:05.320 --> 2:18:09.880]  The Democrats said they were going to challenge the election and then they were the ones saying
[2:18:09.880 --> 2:18:14.760]  kill Trump everywhere, so the idea that we're the ones calling for violence is absurd.
[2:18:14.760 --> 2:18:20.760]  No, there's no question about that and if you look back to 2016, they were the ones
[2:18:20.760 --> 2:18:26.600]  raising the questions about the potential fraud that was connected to the Dominion machines,
[2:18:26.600 --> 2:18:28.480]  to the various voting machines.
[2:18:28.480 --> 2:18:34.680]  So the hypocrisy of the Democrats is their single most consistent quality.
[2:18:34.680 --> 2:18:35.680]  They are always accusing us.
[2:18:35.680 --> 2:18:39.480]  I'm just calling people the n-word saying Trump's a Nazi.
[2:18:39.480 --> 2:18:42.200]  Yeah, well, give me a break.
[2:18:42.200 --> 2:18:46.040]  I mean, this is an absurdity.
[2:18:46.040 --> 2:18:51.440]  This man's record on issues pertaining to the Middle East where he has fostered peace,
[2:18:51.440 --> 2:18:56.680]  his record on civil rights where he understands the very best social program in America is
[2:18:56.680 --> 2:19:02.920]  a job and where unemployment among African Americans drops to the lowest point in American
[2:19:02.920 --> 2:19:07.200]  history while wage growth and job growth are at their highest point.
[2:19:07.200 --> 2:19:12.760]  So this is, again, who is it that gave us criminal justice reform because our current
[2:19:12.760 --> 2:19:19.040]  drug laws pushed by Joe Biden, signed into law by Bill Clinton, are racist.
[2:19:19.040 --> 2:19:24.120]  It's not right that black people get harsher mandatory penalties for the possession of
[2:19:24.120 --> 2:19:29.600]  small amounts of drugs for personal use than white people who get caught with powdered
[2:19:29.600 --> 2:19:30.600]  cocaine.
[2:19:30.600 --> 2:19:32.360]  There's the racism.
[2:19:32.360 --> 2:19:37.320]  Now I hope President Biden will fix that and talk about fixing it, but they haven't fixed
[2:19:37.320 --> 2:19:38.320]  it yet.
[2:19:38.320 --> 2:19:42.200]  The first step back, the second chance act, all under Donald Trump.
[2:19:42.200 --> 2:19:47.840]  He's the first president who's actually got some criminal justice reform done.
[2:19:47.840 --> 2:19:48.840]  No, I agree.
[2:19:48.840 --> 2:19:49.840]  Let me ask you this.
[2:19:49.840 --> 2:19:53.080]  Because he is the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln.
[2:19:53.080 --> 2:19:54.080]  I agree.
[2:19:54.080 --> 2:19:55.080]  Maybe since Washington.
[2:19:55.080 --> 2:19:56.400]  So let me ask you this.
[2:19:56.400 --> 2:19:57.600]  What do we do then?
[2:19:57.600 --> 2:20:01.240]  Because we're just sitting here watching the country destroyed and I understand I don't
[2:20:01.240 --> 2:20:02.240]  want a civil war.
[2:20:02.240 --> 2:20:03.800]  They're trying to start one anyways.
[2:20:03.800 --> 2:20:04.800]  What do we do then?
[2:20:04.800 --> 2:20:09.920]  Well, you can go to Roger Stone's plan to save America.com.
[2:20:09.920 --> 2:20:13.240]  There I have a comprehensive four-port plan to save this country.
[2:20:13.240 --> 2:20:14.240]  Let me stop.
[2:20:14.240 --> 2:20:15.240]  I didn't know you were launching this today.
[2:20:15.240 --> 2:20:17.360]  I know you'd advised some top people of this plan.
[2:20:17.360 --> 2:20:18.880]  I read the plan a month ago.
[2:20:18.880 --> 2:20:19.880]  You updated it.
[2:20:19.880 --> 2:20:20.880]  You're launching that today.
[2:20:20.880 --> 2:20:21.880]  Okay.
[2:20:21.880 --> 2:20:22.880]  Tell us about that.
[2:20:22.880 --> 2:20:23.880]  Yeah.
[2:20:23.880 --> 2:20:28.240]  I mean, this is, let's call this a soft launch, but this has four simple parts.
[2:20:28.240 --> 2:20:32.320]  We cannot win unless we can communicate with each other and the world.
[2:20:32.320 --> 2:20:38.080]  And therefore, you can, as you know, build internet-based platforms that are virtually
[2:20:38.080 --> 2:20:43.040]  impossible to de-platform and through their ownership cannot be censored.
[2:20:43.040 --> 2:20:50.560]  You just have to avoid using Trojan horse technology from Amazon or Google or Apple.
[2:20:50.560 --> 2:20:54.560]  Then once you have those platforms, we need a crowdfunding site.
[2:20:54.560 --> 2:20:55.560]  We need an event site.
[2:20:55.560 --> 2:20:56.560]  Okay.
[2:20:56.560 --> 2:21:01.400]  I knew you were advising a lot of big people, the former president, General Flynn, a lot
[2:21:01.400 --> 2:21:02.400]  of folks.
[2:21:02.400 --> 2:21:06.120]  That's not a secret about a plan, and your plan is great, by the way, I support it.
[2:21:06.120 --> 2:21:08.720]  And that's why we're going to Florida to meet with you and others.
[2:21:08.720 --> 2:21:10.280]  So now you're launching it here on air.
[2:21:10.280 --> 2:21:11.280]  The site looks great.
[2:21:11.280 --> 2:21:12.280]  I'm very envious.
[2:21:12.280 --> 2:21:14.040]  And I wasn't told about the launch today.
[2:21:14.040 --> 2:21:17.160]  Tell me about the site so people get excited about it.
[2:21:17.160 --> 2:21:19.080]  Well, this is a soft launch.
[2:21:19.080 --> 2:21:23.480]  You can go there and there's a video, as you can see, which I outlined the plan.
[2:21:23.480 --> 2:21:25.480]  We will mail you a copy of the plan.
[2:21:25.480 --> 2:21:30.320]  I'll tell you why I did this, Alex, because our people are dispirited because they're
[2:21:30.320 --> 2:21:31.320]  disheartened.
[2:21:31.320 --> 2:21:32.320]  Yeah.
[2:21:32.320 --> 2:21:33.320]  We need to get on the offensive.
[2:21:33.320 --> 2:21:35.640]  That's what we've been trying to get Trump to do.
[2:21:35.640 --> 2:21:40.720]  They're very depressed and they're angry, and many of them are scared, and there's nothing
[2:21:40.720 --> 2:21:45.400]  to be afraid of, because the Bible tells us that good wins in the end.
[2:21:45.400 --> 2:21:50.040]  So those who are ready to give up, they need to buck up and get back in the fight to make
[2:21:50.040 --> 2:21:51.040]  America great again.
[2:21:51.040 --> 2:21:53.040]  Well, Roger, let me stop you, because I've never got to give up.
[2:21:53.040 --> 2:21:55.800]  You've been on there 27 years, you've been political 44 years.
[2:21:55.800 --> 2:21:56.800]  It's not even giving up.
[2:21:56.800 --> 2:22:01.040]  I want to vomit looking at Kamala Harris or at Biden now.
[2:22:01.040 --> 2:22:04.760]  I just, I just am, I don't want to be violent, so I don't know what to do.
[2:22:04.760 --> 2:22:06.200]  I get to a certain point.
[2:22:06.200 --> 2:22:07.800]  I'm, I know how evil they are.
[2:22:07.800 --> 2:22:09.040]  I've already figured that out.
[2:22:09.040 --> 2:22:13.080]  So then I'm researching all day how bad they are, covering the stuff they do.
[2:22:13.080 --> 2:22:15.840]  It's like if a thing's crapping on me, I already know it's crapping on me.
[2:22:15.840 --> 2:22:17.840]  I don't want to count how many times it does it.
[2:22:17.840 --> 2:22:18.840]  Does that make sense?
[2:22:18.840 --> 2:22:19.840]  It does.
[2:22:19.840 --> 2:22:25.040]  But the problem is we cannot go into the next election with the same election laws and the
[2:22:25.040 --> 2:22:28.480]  same system of fraud that existed in the last election.
[2:22:28.480 --> 2:22:33.360]  But before you can fix that, you must have the ability to communicate with each other
[2:22:33.360 --> 2:22:35.040]  and with the world.
[2:22:35.040 --> 2:22:40.440]  And right now, because of the, essentially, the controlling censorship of all mass communications
[2:22:40.440 --> 2:22:45.200]  in the United States, it's not just the internet, it's, it's network television, it's cable
[2:22:45.200 --> 2:22:51.440]  television, except for the great lineup of Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity at night
[2:22:51.440 --> 2:22:54.480]  on Fox, Laura Ingram, other than that.
[2:22:54.480 --> 2:22:55.480]  That's right.
[2:22:55.480 --> 2:22:59.120]  I mean, literally, it's mass total censorship, far and takeover.
[2:22:59.120 --> 2:23:01.120]  That's how they're doing this.
[2:23:01.120 --> 2:23:05.720]  There is no question, but I've laid out a plan that will work, communications, election
[2:23:05.720 --> 2:23:11.120]  law reform, clean out the rhinos from the Republican Party, the factless, gutless rhinos.
[2:23:11.120 --> 2:23:12.520]  People listen to Roger Stone.
[2:23:12.520 --> 2:23:14.360]  They listen to Alex Jones.
[2:23:14.360 --> 2:23:18.200]  So it's great that you're getting that plan out to the general public.
[2:23:18.200 --> 2:23:23.360]  But the listeners, you need to go get the plan and share it with Congress, correct?
[2:23:23.360 --> 2:23:28.720]  There's no question, but this is also, I think, it's designed to give people hope.
[2:23:28.720 --> 2:23:32.640]  It's designed to tell people that there are leaders in this movement, the America First
[2:23:32.640 --> 2:23:35.320]  Movement, who are working on saving the country.
[2:23:35.320 --> 2:23:36.680]  We haven't given up.
[2:23:36.680 --> 2:23:41.640]  We understand that some of these are technologically complicated issues, but we're pretty good
[2:23:41.640 --> 2:23:42.640]  at technology.
[2:23:42.640 --> 2:23:46.920]  We put that every day here at InfoWorst because Alex, they tried to squash you like a bug
[2:23:46.920 --> 2:23:47.920]  and they failed.
[2:23:47.920 --> 2:23:50.360]  The InfoWorst audience is bigger than ever.
[2:23:50.360 --> 2:23:51.360]  That's right.
[2:23:51.360 --> 2:23:52.360]  Stay there.
[2:23:52.360 --> 2:23:56.480]  Your voice counts.
[2:23:56.480 --> 2:24:01.480]  When you share information, be it over the Internet or in person, it changes the world.
[2:24:01.480 --> 2:24:04.080]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[2:24:04.080 --> 2:24:05.580]  They know you're angry.
[2:24:05.580 --> 2:24:09.880]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool

[2:24:53.040 --> 2:24:59.720]  Big Pharma was born out of the Rockefeller oil industry in 1900 with the petrochemical.
[2:24:59.720 --> 2:25:05.960]  The petrochemical then dominated two major industries, plastics and drugs.
[2:25:05.960 --> 2:25:11.080]  This began synthesizing patented versions of naturally sourced drugs.
[2:25:11.080 --> 2:25:14.640]  The natural sources were then made illegal.
[2:25:14.640 --> 2:25:19.360]  Pharmaceuticals became medicine, and the sicker people got, the more their industry grew.
[2:25:19.360 --> 2:25:23.760]  It's a death cult, and it's up to the individual to escape.
[2:25:23.760 --> 2:25:30.240]  Good health begins with a healthy immune system, which needs the proper nutrients to thrive.
[2:25:30.240 --> 2:25:33.720]  Nutrients we cannot readily get from our food today.
[2:25:33.720 --> 2:25:38.800]  The combinations of vitamin C and zinc and vitamin D3 with calcium have been proven to
[2:25:38.800 --> 2:25:43.120]  be what we need to maintain a healthy immune system.
[2:25:43.120 --> 2:25:48.280]  Go to InfoWorstStore.com and start supporting your natural immune system now with the Mega
[2:25:48.280 --> 2:25:52.640]  Immune Support Pack, now 40% off.
[2:25:52.640 --> 2:25:58.280]  Bioremediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil and subsurface material
[2:25:58.280 --> 2:26:02.720]  by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms
[2:26:02.720 --> 2:26:04.640]  and degrade targeted pollutants.
[2:26:04.640 --> 2:26:09.720]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation
[2:26:09.720 --> 2:26:11.720]  products to the everyday consumer.
[2:26:11.720 --> 2:26:16.440]  Their first product they are launching is called BioSepticPro, a product specifically
[2:26:16.440 --> 2:26:19.400]  designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[2:26:19.400 --> 2:26:23.760]  BioSepticPro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[2:26:23.760 --> 2:26:25.680]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[2:26:25.680 --> 2:26:30.760]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank, and is at least 100 times more effective
[2:26:30.760 --> 2:26:35.000]  than similar microbial products due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[2:26:35.000 --> 2:26:40.040]  BioSepticPro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms.
[2:26:40.040 --> 2:26:44.080]  Visit thebiopros.com today and protect your septic system.
[2:26:44.080 --> 2:26:46.040]  That's thebiopros.com.
[2:26:46.040 --> 2:26:53.080]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks, and the job it does is unparalleled, thebiopros.com.
[2:26:53.080 --> 2:26:58.480]  As negative as times are right now, and as depressing as things can be, you have to
[2:26:58.480 --> 2:27:01.400]  understand that this is all a test.
[2:27:01.400 --> 2:27:07.360]  This experience, this life on this planet, is a reckoning.
[2:27:07.360 --> 2:27:12.600]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out with third dimension, so we can decide
[2:27:12.600 --> 2:27:16.720]  where we want to spend eternity, and what level we want to go to, and it really does
[2:27:16.720 --> 2:27:21.360]  come down to that, so as sad as things are, and as evil as things are, look at all the
[2:27:21.360 --> 2:27:26.280]  good in the world as well, and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[2:27:26.280 --> 2:27:29.880]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[2:27:29.880 --> 2:27:35.480]  God is the author of us having free will, and that free will is a beautiful thing.
[2:27:35.480 --> 2:27:39.680]  When you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture, and Washington
[2:27:39.680 --> 2:27:45.000]  D.C., and Fauci, and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[2:27:45.000 --> 2:27:48.680]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in a bad, because Satan
[2:27:48.680 --> 2:27:55.800]  hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[2:27:55.800 --> 2:28:02.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:28:26.800 --> 2:28:33.040]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we've known the so-called COVID vaccines are cancer-growing
[2:28:33.040 --> 2:28:34.840]  factories.
[2:28:34.840 --> 2:28:41.880]  They take any cells that are precancerous, and they supercharge them to grow.
[2:28:41.880 --> 2:28:46.200]  That's what Wolfgang Wodark, the head of the main EU commission, warned in December last
[2:28:46.200 --> 2:28:47.200]  year.
[2:28:47.200 --> 2:28:51.760]  It's what Yadon, the former chief scientist at Pfizer, said.
[2:28:51.760 --> 2:28:57.280]  Another of the news, oh, swelling after COVID shots may cause cancer or false alarms in
[2:28:57.280 --> 2:29:01.800]  your breasts, in your lungs, in your uterus, in your testicles, in your prostate.
[2:29:01.800 --> 2:29:07.360]  Well, a big article out breaking now at infowars.com.
[2:29:07.360 --> 2:29:13.680]  Florida urologists find signs of infertility and prostate cancer in men jab with COVID-19.
[2:29:13.680 --> 2:29:17.200]  Patients that were dormant had their cancer removed.
[2:29:17.200 --> 2:29:26.800]  People they've been testing suddenly also had cancer or had elevated numbers of the
[2:29:26.800 --> 2:29:32.440]  chemicals that let them know the prostate is cancerous.
[2:29:32.440 --> 2:29:33.600]  There's a video.
[2:29:33.600 --> 2:29:34.600]  It's all right there.
[2:29:34.600 --> 2:29:36.400]  It's not like he's saying this in a vacuum.
[2:29:36.400 --> 2:29:41.600]  This is what people warned about this would do because it's a normal protein in the body.
[2:29:41.600 --> 2:29:43.160]  They're not trying to kill what's in the virus.
[2:29:43.160 --> 2:29:48.560]  It's the virus shell that is a protein that happens to be in all fast-growing cells in
[2:29:48.560 --> 2:29:49.560]  your body.
[2:29:49.560 --> 2:29:52.280]  Well, your prostate works its ass off like testicles.
[2:29:52.280 --> 2:29:57.960]  I mean, it is producing the ocean in which all those sperm that your testicles produce.
[2:29:57.960 --> 2:30:01.520]  I mean, my testicles are like, I guess, like superstars here.
[2:30:01.520 --> 2:30:05.640]  Anybody that's got a wife married and sexually active, I mean, you're producing billions
[2:30:05.640 --> 2:30:11.560]  of these things every few months, you know, millions every few days, and this is fast-growing
[2:30:11.560 --> 2:30:12.560]  cells.
[2:30:12.560 --> 2:30:14.240]  These cells are a fast-growing protein.
[2:30:14.240 --> 2:30:19.440]  It's the same protein and the body goes in and attacks itself.
[2:30:19.440 --> 2:30:23.480]  Incredible article after Roger leaves us, we'll play that video.
[2:30:23.480 --> 2:30:27.080]  Another huge article, Gateway Pond, at least all the mainline science, medical advisors
[2:30:27.080 --> 2:30:33.040]  to CDC, higher than expected number of cases of heart problems in young adults and adolescents
[2:30:33.040 --> 2:30:34.040]  following COVID vaccination.
[2:30:34.040 --> 2:30:42.440]  And then earlier, I showed you the big Twitter feed from the VARS own reporting system saying
[2:30:42.440 --> 2:30:47.920]  over-the-top reactions for young people, death, heart attacks, here's another one, UK television
[2:30:47.920 --> 2:30:53.440]  personality, rush emergency room following COVID vaccination.
[2:30:53.440 --> 2:30:59.200]  And it goes on and on and on.
[2:30:59.200 --> 2:31:02.360]  Young people may have more side effects than COVID vaccine.
[2:31:02.360 --> 2:31:07.120]  Doctors explain why, Yahoo News, you know, we're not just making this up so they keep
[2:31:07.120 --> 2:31:11.040]  playing dumb and investigating each new case as if there isn't a whole compendium like
[2:31:11.040 --> 2:31:15.840]  a rattlesnake bites me and my legs swells up or a truck hits me and I die or I smoke
[2:31:15.840 --> 2:31:19.200]  cigarettes, I get lung cancer, I drink beer, I get drunk.
[2:31:19.200 --> 2:31:20.200]  We know what's happening.
[2:31:20.200 --> 2:31:25.200]  FDA to authorize Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine for 12 to 15-year-olds, the Moderna is already
[2:31:25.200 --> 2:31:29.560]  what's hitting people and causing such a giant problem.
[2:31:29.560 --> 2:31:34.560]  I want to get Roger Stone's take on this in a moment, but first, here's Biden just an
[2:31:34.560 --> 2:31:41.000]  hour ago, America will be the arsenal of vaccines in the fight against COVID-19 just as it was
[2:31:41.000 --> 2:31:47.000]  the arsenal of democracy during World War II, so now our job is to give the U.N. hundreds
[2:31:47.000 --> 2:31:51.400]  of millions of doses of the AstraZeneca shot banned in the U.S. and banned in Europe.
[2:31:51.400 --> 2:31:55.560]  That's a little footnote you guys have to tell you, so again, depopulation agenda, here
[2:31:55.560 --> 2:31:56.560]  it is.
[2:31:56.560 --> 2:32:02.080]  It says the American economy is recovering, it is in all of our interest to have the global
[2:32:02.080 --> 2:32:08.200]  economy begin to recover as well, and that won't happen unless we can get this pandemic
[2:32:08.200 --> 2:32:11.000]  under control worldwide.
[2:32:11.000 --> 2:32:17.640]  That's why, as I said in my address to the joint session of Congress in April, America
[2:32:17.640 --> 2:32:25.000]  will be the arsenal of vaccines in our fight against COVID-19, just as America was the
[2:32:25.000 --> 2:32:28.480]  arsenal of democracy during World War II.
[2:32:28.480 --> 2:32:35.640]  Over the past four months, we've taken a number of steps toward this historic effort.
[2:32:35.640 --> 2:32:40.940]  We have contributed more than any nation to COVAX, a collective global effort that is
[2:32:40.940 --> 2:32:44.200]  delivering COVID-19 vaccines across the world.
[2:32:44.200 --> 2:32:48.720]  So what they did is they turned the PCR test down to 28 cycles when he got elected or stole
[2:32:48.720 --> 2:32:52.240]  it so they could say COVID was gone, but the third world, it's not gone, there's no lockdown.
[2:32:52.240 --> 2:32:56.480]  So he's like, once you've given this special shot I got for you, then you can go outside
[2:32:56.480 --> 2:32:57.480]  again.
[2:32:57.480 --> 2:33:01.180]  Though the lockdown, they admit mainline literature today has already starved 20 million people
[2:33:01.180 --> 2:33:05.360]  extra to death, more than 10 times global COVID death numbers.
[2:33:05.360 --> 2:33:07.920]  Roger Stone, give us your take on what you just saw.
[2:33:07.920 --> 2:33:13.080]  Well, what's really extraordinary to me, Alex, is that they're now insisting that first responders
[2:33:13.080 --> 2:33:18.280]  who have already had COVID-19 must be vaccinated.
[2:33:18.280 --> 2:33:23.400]  This is about money, because if you've already had the virus and you have the antibodies,
[2:33:23.400 --> 2:33:27.640]  theoretically, there should be no reason for you to be vaccinated.
[2:33:27.640 --> 2:33:31.680]  But that's science, Roger, I don't want to hear about science.
[2:33:31.680 --> 2:33:37.680]  Well, people should look at the show we did on the war room with Ty and Charlene Bollinger
[2:33:37.680 --> 2:33:42.800]  the other night, which was really extraordinary because Ty Bollinger went through a series
[2:33:42.800 --> 2:33:50.240]  of compounds and ingredients that are in these vaccinations that are specifically prohibited
[2:33:50.240 --> 2:33:57.640]  for human consumption by the very same bodies who allow these vaccinations to be used for
[2:33:57.640 --> 2:33:59.000]  temporary use.
[2:33:59.000 --> 2:34:04.680]  What we need right now, frankly, is President Trump to make his position clear that people
[2:34:04.680 --> 2:34:09.120]  should not be required to mandatorily take these vaccinations.
[2:34:09.120 --> 2:34:10.920]  We are a nation of free choice.
[2:34:10.920 --> 2:34:14.680]  If people choose to poison themselves, they have the right to do that.
[2:34:14.680 --> 2:34:20.480]  I myself would not be vaccinated under any circumstances, first the fact that the vaccination
[2:34:20.480 --> 2:34:26.440]  is only approved for emergency use, that he's not approved for general use.
[2:34:26.440 --> 2:34:29.400]  By the way, that's going to expire very soon.
[2:34:29.400 --> 2:34:33.240]  And then, secondarily, the fact that the guys who made these, or they should say the companies
[2:34:33.240 --> 2:34:38.080]  who made these vaccinations have no legal liability at all.
[2:34:38.080 --> 2:34:42.560]  You take their vaccination and, God forbid, you should die, they pay nothing.
[2:34:42.560 --> 2:34:45.240]  They just walk away with their massive profits.
[2:34:45.240 --> 2:34:50.440]  So it has been estimated by someone who is an expert who told me that if you just vaccinate
[2:34:50.440 --> 2:34:56.120]  the first responders who have already had the virus and have the antibodies, that will
[2:34:56.120 --> 2:35:00.080]  make $1 billion for the manufacturers.
[2:35:00.080 --> 2:35:01.080]  $1 billion.
[2:35:01.080 --> 2:35:03.800]  Well, Roger, I haven't been tested and you haven't.
[2:35:03.800 --> 2:35:06.320]  We've been out in crowds of hundreds of thousands, millions.
[2:35:06.320 --> 2:35:08.000]  We obviously already had it.
[2:35:08.000 --> 2:35:09.000]  We got over it.
[2:35:09.000 --> 2:35:10.920]  But I mean, the point is, this is a fraud.
[2:35:10.920 --> 2:35:15.600]  Mainline science says if you've had COVID-19, you shouldn't take the inoculation and cause
[2:35:15.600 --> 2:35:17.720]  a violent autoimmune response.
[2:35:17.720 --> 2:35:21.920]  Well, look, put it this way, Fauci lied.
[2:35:21.920 --> 2:35:22.920]  People died.
[2:35:22.920 --> 2:35:23.920]  I think that sums it up.
[2:35:23.920 --> 2:35:28.240]  And this is not the first time, by the way, I think Tony Fauci is going to go down with
[2:35:28.240 --> 2:35:33.120]  Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and Chairman Mao as one of the great mass murderers of
[2:35:33.120 --> 2:35:34.120]  all time.
[2:35:34.120 --> 2:35:36.600]  And those who say, what are you talking about?
[2:35:36.600 --> 2:35:42.040]  Millions of people who have taken this vaccination have had no reaction, to which I say, yeah,
[2:35:42.040 --> 2:35:43.320]  it's too early to say.
[2:35:43.320 --> 2:35:47.360]  How do we know you don't have side effects five years from now?
[2:35:47.360 --> 2:35:50.760]  Ten years from now, a year from now, we don't know.
[2:35:50.760 --> 2:35:52.760]  We really don't know.
[2:35:52.760 --> 2:35:55.440]  And this is not the first time for Dr. Fauci.
[2:35:55.440 --> 2:36:02.400]  Back during the HIV plague, when AIDS first became known, when gay men were dying of PCP
[2:36:02.400 --> 2:36:08.480]  pneumonia, there was a simple remedy, back trim, a relatively cheap drug that had been
[2:36:08.480 --> 2:36:11.080]  on the market for years and was plentiful.
[2:36:11.080 --> 2:36:15.920]  But Tony Fauci was so interested in developing a vaccination that would make him rich and
[2:36:15.920 --> 2:36:21.120]  famous that he delayed the approval of the on-label use for back trim.
[2:36:21.120 --> 2:36:24.080]  How many gay men died because of Tony Fauci?
[2:36:24.080 --> 2:36:25.080]  Well, that's right.
[2:36:25.080 --> 2:36:27.320]  He was a major villain then and is now.
[2:36:27.320 --> 2:36:30.040]  He blocked Randesivir hydroxychloroquine.
[2:36:30.040 --> 2:36:32.040]  This is his same MO.
[2:36:32.040 --> 2:36:39.080]  Well, the reason he had to block hydrochloroquine is, by law, you can't develop a vaccination
[2:36:39.080 --> 2:36:45.040]  if there's a simple drug that resolves the issue that has efficacy against the disease.
[2:36:45.040 --> 2:36:47.280]  That's why they had to discredit hydrochloroquine.
[2:36:47.280 --> 2:36:52.480]  Look, this guy is going to go down as one of the greatest criminals of all time.
[2:36:52.480 --> 2:36:57.480]  Joe Biden came out the other day and gave him his full support and his full endorsement.
[2:36:57.480 --> 2:37:00.520]  That means you know Fauci's on the banana peel, even as we speak.
[2:37:00.520 --> 2:37:01.520]  All right.
[2:37:01.520 --> 2:37:02.520]  I'll do a few more minutes with you.
[2:37:02.520 --> 2:37:05.760]  When we come back, then folks, I'm going to get all the news out of the head a little
[2:37:05.760 --> 2:37:06.760]  bit in the next hour.
[2:37:06.760 --> 2:37:07.760]  Matt Bracken, take it over.
[2:37:07.760 --> 2:37:10.640]  But I'm not saying the best part of the show has come up, because we had Mike Lindell
[2:37:10.640 --> 2:37:11.640]  and Roger Stone on.
[2:37:11.640 --> 2:37:15.640]  I've got a bunch of condensed stuff out of the head, clip after clip, that is bombshell
[2:37:15.640 --> 2:37:20.440]  after bombshell after bombshell that I've got to get to.
[2:37:20.440 --> 2:37:21.920]  So we'll push Bracken back a little bit.
[2:37:21.920 --> 2:37:23.920]  We'll come back to Roger Stone here in just a moment.
[2:37:23.920 --> 2:37:27.200]  I want to ask him about that big clip over the weekend.
[2:37:27.200 --> 2:37:31.240]  Trump saying, hey, Biden's going to be out of the White House a lot quicker than you
[2:37:31.240 --> 2:37:32.240]  think.
[2:37:32.240 --> 2:37:34.480]  That is pretty cryptic from the 45th president.
[2:37:34.480 --> 2:37:40.440]  So I want to get the doodoo, as they say, from the guy that would know Roger Stone
[2:37:40.440 --> 2:37:41.440]  straight ahead.
[2:37:41.440 --> 2:37:47.400]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com, newswars.com, fan.tv, and you can't promote those URLs,

[2:39:42.840 --> 2:39:44.840]  Go to the info wars store.
[2:39:44.840 --> 2:39:51.200]  Never been a better time than right now, super male vitality at infowarsstore.com.
[2:39:51.200 --> 2:39:57.840]  14 months ago, I began to see on the broadcast every day when the first world collapses,
[2:39:57.840 --> 2:39:59.640]  the third world dies.
[2:39:59.640 --> 2:40:04.360]  We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts that when you
[2:40:04.360 --> 2:40:09.520]  shut down the first world, it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the third world
[2:40:09.520 --> 2:40:11.520]  and really hurt the first world.
[2:40:11.520 --> 2:40:15.160]  Well now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States.
[2:40:15.160 --> 2:40:18.800]  That's because the companies and the systems and the drivers that can barely get the job
[2:40:18.800 --> 2:40:21.800]  done before delivering gas have been shut down.
[2:40:21.800 --> 2:40:24.840]  Plus the Keystone Pipeline has been shut down, along with other pipelines.
[2:40:24.840 --> 2:40:28.360]  The left is now blowing up dams across the US.
[2:40:28.360 --> 2:40:29.480]  We're being shut down.
[2:40:29.480 --> 2:40:31.640]  Our coal power plants are off as well.
[2:40:31.640 --> 2:40:34.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a total slave.
[2:40:34.480 --> 2:40:35.880]  The third world is imploding as well.
[2:40:35.880 --> 2:40:36.880]  The borders have been removed.
[2:40:36.880 --> 2:40:41.200]  Until you wake up, and this is a globalist tricom takeover, Gregory said, you have no
[2:40:41.200 --> 2:40:42.200]  hope.
[2:40:42.200 --> 2:40:47.080]  They're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds of the gas needed this summer.
[2:40:47.080 --> 2:40:50.520]  So they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you
[2:40:50.520 --> 2:40:51.520]  and your family.
[2:40:51.520 --> 2:40:57.480]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on there.
[2:40:57.480 --> 2:41:01.880]  But looking at the world from the perspective of the globalist, the public's so dumbed down
[2:41:01.880 --> 2:41:05.160]  that they don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning them,
[2:41:05.160 --> 2:41:08.480]  that we're sterilizing them, that they deserve to be killed.
[2:41:08.480 --> 2:41:10.960]  Yes, that's the position of the globalists.
[2:41:10.960 --> 2:41:11.960]  They play God.
[2:41:11.960 --> 2:41:16.000]  And they think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to us.
[2:41:16.000 --> 2:41:19.440]  And I've told you that the globalists have tried to hire me.
[2:41:19.440 --> 2:41:20.960]  They've tried to get me to join them.
[2:41:20.960 --> 2:41:25.160]  But metaphysically, at a spiritual level, I have the Holy Spirit.
[2:41:25.160 --> 2:41:26.160]  I'm finishing God's.
[2:41:26.160 --> 2:41:30.400]  And I know that God does not like that, so I cannot join the animal.
[2:41:30.400 --> 2:41:34.880]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with
[2:41:34.880 --> 2:41:39.280]  the system, believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power on it.
[2:41:39.280 --> 2:41:45.120]  Whether you're just a steelworker or a schoolteacher or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God.
[2:41:45.120 --> 2:41:49.640]  And treating other people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real
[2:41:49.640 --> 2:41:51.440]  God of the universe doesn't like.
[2:41:51.440 --> 2:41:55.320]  And that's a fact.
[2:41:55.320 --> 2:42:16.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:42:16.920 --> 2:42:19.680]  I wanted to ask Roger Stone about Trump's big statement over the weekend.
[2:42:19.680 --> 2:42:20.680]  We'll do that in a moment.
[2:42:20.680 --> 2:42:23.680]  But he texted me earlier and I missed it while we're on air.
[2:42:23.680 --> 2:42:24.680]  He's polite.
[2:42:24.680 --> 2:42:25.680]  He's like, I would do it.
[2:42:25.680 --> 2:42:26.680]  He said, let's hit Fauci.
[2:42:26.680 --> 2:42:29.040]  So then I had a chance to talk to him in the break.
[2:42:29.040 --> 2:42:30.680]  So here's a few of those clips he wanted to get to.
[2:42:30.680 --> 2:42:31.680]  And I agree.
[2:42:31.680 --> 2:42:32.680]  We should have played these yesterday.
[2:42:32.680 --> 2:42:34.800]  Here's Fauci saying, you don't question me.
[2:42:34.800 --> 2:42:35.800]  That's science.
[2:42:35.800 --> 2:42:37.080]  Like, he's the oracle.
[2:42:37.080 --> 2:42:38.080]  He's God.
[2:42:38.080 --> 2:42:39.920]  And also, people want him in jail.
[2:42:39.920 --> 2:42:41.600]  Yeah, he ran the Luan Lab.
[2:42:41.600 --> 2:42:43.400]  He's been caught lying to Congress.
[2:42:43.400 --> 2:42:44.400]  Red handed.
[2:42:44.400 --> 2:42:45.400]  Here it is.
[2:42:45.400 --> 2:42:46.800]  You're at the focal point.
[2:42:46.800 --> 2:42:50.720]  What is your level of concern that we're going to discredit public health officials to the
[2:42:50.720 --> 2:42:53.960]  point of, you know, look at Russia.
[2:42:53.960 --> 2:42:57.640]  They actually have a good vaccine and none of their citizens will take it because they
[2:42:57.640 --> 2:42:59.920]  don't trust their own government.
[2:42:59.920 --> 2:43:00.920]  Right.
[2:43:00.920 --> 2:43:06.120]  It's very dangerous, Chuck, because a lot of what you're seeing as attacks on me quite
[2:43:06.120 --> 2:43:12.760]  frankly are attacks on science because all of the things that I have spoken about consistently
[2:43:12.760 --> 2:43:18.000]  from the very beginning have been fundamentally based on science.
[2:43:18.000 --> 2:43:23.480]  Sometimes those things were inconvenient truths for people and there was pushback against
[2:43:23.480 --> 2:43:24.480]  me.
[2:43:24.480 --> 2:43:30.840]  So if you are trying to, you know, get at me as a public health official and a scientist,
[2:43:30.840 --> 2:43:36.040]  you're really attacking not only Dr. Anthony Fauci, you're attacking science and anybody
[2:43:36.040 --> 2:43:41.400]  that looks at what's going on clearly sees that.
[2:43:41.400 --> 2:43:44.800]  You have to be asleep not to see that.
[2:43:44.800 --> 2:43:47.080]  That is what's going on.
[2:43:47.080 --> 2:43:51.000]  Science and the truth are being attacked.
[2:43:51.000 --> 2:43:58.440]  That issue at mass is people want to fire me or put me in jail for what I've done, namely
[2:43:58.440 --> 2:44:00.360]  follow the science.
[2:44:00.360 --> 2:44:06.040]  I could go the next half an hour going through each and every point that they made.
[2:44:06.040 --> 2:44:10.200]  It's preposterous, Chuck, totally preposterous.
[2:44:10.200 --> 2:44:13.160]  But Roger, he doesn't actually challenge any of the facts we love.
[2:44:13.160 --> 2:44:18.640]  Well, first of all, Chuck Todd belongs behind the counter at Macy's as far as I'm concerned
[2:44:18.640 --> 2:44:20.440]  when it comes to being a journalist.
[2:44:20.440 --> 2:44:27.200]  Secondarily, actually, again, the Alinsky Technic, nothing he does pertains to silence.
[2:44:27.200 --> 2:44:33.200]  He has violated all of the traditional protocols of medicine and he's been caught lying.
[2:44:33.200 --> 2:44:38.680]  Now they prosecuted me for lying to Congress, yet the misstatements I made to Congress were
[2:44:38.680 --> 2:44:43.680]  completely immaterial, irrelevant, I had no underlying crime.
[2:44:43.680 --> 2:44:47.120]  Tony Fauci said he didn't fund the Wuhan lab.
[2:44:47.120 --> 2:44:49.080]  His signature is on the paychecks.
[2:44:49.080 --> 2:44:56.200]  And he's in hearings eight years ago saying, defending anti-function.
[2:44:56.200 --> 2:44:57.200]  There's no question.
[2:44:57.200 --> 2:44:59.040]  And he lied about how it was funded.
[2:44:59.040 --> 2:45:03.320]  So this is unraveling very quickly, but try to wrap himself in silence.
[2:45:03.320 --> 2:45:06.960]  That's like asking the Boston Strangler to massage your neck.
[2:45:06.960 --> 2:45:09.000]  Well, that was my next question.
[2:45:09.000 --> 2:45:11.800]  You're a longtime political smart guy operative.
[2:45:11.800 --> 2:45:13.400]  How does Fauci get out of this?
[2:45:13.400 --> 2:45:17.120]  Because I mean, wow.
[2:45:17.120 --> 2:45:21.400]  I don't think he does actually, because we're at the point that his lies have become so
[2:45:21.400 --> 2:45:27.520]  egregious and his ability to keep his lies straight, his inconsistencies, masks work,
[2:45:27.520 --> 2:45:32.040]  masks don't work, masks are crucial, children should be vaccinated, children should not
[2:45:32.040 --> 2:45:33.280]  be vaccinated.
[2:45:33.280 --> 2:45:35.800]  This guy can't even keep his lies straight.
[2:45:35.800 --> 2:45:42.200]  This is only a matter of time before the burden, the political cost of having this creep around,
[2:45:42.200 --> 2:45:47.560]  this mass murderer around is going to be too great even for the Biden administration.
[2:45:47.560 --> 2:45:56.440]  So I think I pray to God that he is brought to justice, because we have now seen consistently
[2:45:56.440 --> 2:45:59.240]  that this guy's incapable of telling the truth.
[2:45:59.240 --> 2:46:04.320]  And then when he goes out and says, well, reports that this virus was developed in a
[2:46:04.320 --> 2:46:07.240]  Wuhai lab, that's pretty far out.
[2:46:07.240 --> 2:46:08.360]  Those are code words.
[2:46:08.360 --> 2:46:09.360]  That's far out.
[2:46:09.360 --> 2:46:14.800]  In other words, anyone who exercises their free speech right using the actual science
[2:46:14.800 --> 2:46:20.920]  and the growing body of actual medical evidence that this guy is full of crap, well, that
[2:46:20.920 --> 2:46:22.280]  person's a cuckoo.
[2:46:22.280 --> 2:46:23.280]  That person's irresponsible.
[2:46:23.280 --> 2:46:27.760]  No, the guy who's irresponsible is Tony Fauci.
[2:46:27.760 --> 2:46:29.520]  And here's what I like about this.
[2:46:29.520 --> 2:46:32.080]  It can be boiled down to a simple slogan.
[2:46:32.080 --> 2:46:38.160]  People like slogans, Fauci lied, people died, Fauci lied, people died.
[2:46:38.160 --> 2:46:43.680]  That's where Fauci's convicted, the crime is against humanity.
[2:46:43.680 --> 2:46:45.880]  He marches up to the gallows pole.
[2:46:45.880 --> 2:46:50.600]  Well, he should certainly be held responsible for what he's done.
[2:46:50.600 --> 2:46:56.840]  I mean, just the fact that we know for a certainty today that hydrochloroquine works.
[2:46:56.840 --> 2:47:00.240]  Hydrochloroquine helped people who had COVID-19.
[2:47:00.240 --> 2:47:04.320]  There was no point in taking it prophylactically, it didn't work prophylactically.
[2:47:04.320 --> 2:47:07.160]  It worked on those who actually contracted the virus.
[2:47:07.160 --> 2:47:11.400]  When they tried to block it, which is another crime against humanity, enclosing Roger Stone,
[2:47:11.400 --> 2:47:15.200]  a lot of incredible things you've covered today here, what do you make of Trump kind
[2:47:15.200 --> 2:47:20.560]  of coming out of rest, which he deserved, looking good, losing like 20, 30 pounds, doing
[2:47:20.560 --> 2:47:23.720]  all these big rallies that have, you know, more viewers than Tucker Carlson the first
[2:47:23.720 --> 2:47:27.280]  time he gives them, a very exciting North Carolina, all this.
[2:47:27.280 --> 2:47:31.000]  What do you make of him in last weekend saying, oh, we're going to win the Senate, win the
[2:47:31.000 --> 2:47:35.560]  House, we'll have the White House sooner than you think, what do you, I mean, obviously
[2:47:35.560 --> 2:47:37.040]  that statement is directed.
[2:47:37.040 --> 2:47:38.840]  People ask him, what do you mean by that?
[2:47:38.840 --> 2:47:40.840]  He would say, what do you think that means?
[2:47:40.840 --> 2:47:45.440]  Well, first of all, look, I have great respect for Mike Lindell, who's doing an extraordinary
[2:47:45.440 --> 2:47:49.800]  job in spending his own money, putting his mouth, his mouth, his money, where his mouth
[2:47:49.800 --> 2:47:53.840]  is, trying to undercover the election fraud in all these states.
[2:47:53.840 --> 2:47:59.160]  I'm a political realist and I make the subjective judgment that even then turning over the election
[2:47:59.160 --> 2:48:00.720]  will be very difficult.
[2:48:00.720 --> 2:48:02.160]  I really hope to be wrong.
[2:48:02.160 --> 2:48:04.080]  I hope Mike Lindell is right.
[2:48:04.080 --> 2:48:06.800]  I hope the president's instinct is correct.
[2:48:06.800 --> 2:48:10.800]  At the moment, I've got to be honest with you, I'm so distracted with my wife's cancer
[2:48:10.800 --> 2:48:16.360]  treatments and the tsunami of contradictory medical advice that we're trying to sort through
[2:48:16.360 --> 2:48:22.560]  and the millions and millions of PhDs and doctors and professionals as well as holistic
[2:48:22.560 --> 2:48:27.040]  and homeopathic healers who've contacted us trying to help us.
[2:48:27.040 --> 2:48:28.040]  It's heartwarming.
[2:48:28.040 --> 2:48:29.040]  It really is.
[2:48:29.040 --> 2:48:30.040]  But it's also overwhelming.
[2:48:30.040 --> 2:48:31.040]  It is.
[2:48:31.040 --> 2:48:34.920]  Hey, Roger, what do you make of so many people that get the inoculation and get cancer in
[2:48:34.920 --> 2:48:36.800]  a few months?
[2:48:36.800 --> 2:48:38.360]  That's what all these scientists are saying.
[2:48:38.360 --> 2:48:39.360]  It's doing.
[2:48:39.360 --> 2:48:42.600]  I've got a new article out of Florida, out of Palm Beach, close to where you live.
[2:48:42.600 --> 2:48:43.800]  I don't get in your own private life.
[2:48:43.800 --> 2:48:45.200]  I don't know if you made this public or not.
[2:48:45.200 --> 2:48:49.200]  You didn't take the vaccine, but did anybody else take the vaccine recently that just got
[2:48:49.200 --> 2:48:50.200]  cancer?
[2:48:50.200 --> 2:48:58.640]  Well, no, but I can tell you that a member of my family did take it, not my wife, and
[2:48:58.640 --> 2:49:03.120]  they were in perfect health and their blood pressure immediately dropped so low that they
[2:49:03.120 --> 2:49:07.280]  were actually blind for six hours and had to be hospitalized.
[2:49:07.280 --> 2:49:08.280]  Had to be hospitalized.
[2:49:08.280 --> 2:49:09.280]  But I was just guessing.
[2:49:09.280 --> 2:49:13.480]  I was trying to see your wife didn't take it, but somebody else you did had to be hospitalized.
[2:49:13.480 --> 2:49:14.480]  Wow.
[2:49:14.480 --> 2:49:17.280]  Because everybody I know is similar things.
[2:49:17.280 --> 2:49:20.800]  A anecdotally, it's really quite extraordinary everywhere I go.
[2:49:20.800 --> 2:49:25.520]  People tell me about someone they know who took the vaccination and had an immediate
[2:49:25.520 --> 2:49:26.520]  bad reaction.
[2:49:26.520 --> 2:49:29.200]  In some cases, a life-threatening reaction.
[2:49:29.200 --> 2:49:35.720]  So it leads me to question whether the number of deaths are actually being reported accurately.
[2:49:35.720 --> 2:49:36.720]  Exactly.
[2:49:36.720 --> 2:49:41.680]  We're going to believe our friends and family and neighbors and doctors and local nurses
[2:49:41.680 --> 2:49:45.280]  or believe CNN and others paid off Big Pharma.
[2:49:45.280 --> 2:49:47.840]  We're going to cover Russell Brand's take on that in a moment.
[2:49:47.840 --> 2:49:52.360]  All right, Roger, glad to hear that your incredible wife, I'm a good friend with, amazing lady,
[2:49:52.360 --> 2:49:53.360]  is back home.
[2:49:53.360 --> 2:49:55.720]  Folks keep praying for Roger Stone and Roger.
[2:49:55.720 --> 2:49:58.480]  Any time you want to come on, the microphone is waiting for you.
[2:49:58.480 --> 2:50:01.280]  You have your own section at band.video as well.
[2:50:01.280 --> 2:50:03.640]  Yeah, band.video is incredible.
[2:50:03.640 --> 2:50:06.080]  If folks haven't been there, they need to go there.
[2:50:06.080 --> 2:50:07.880]  There's some great, great content.
[2:50:07.880 --> 2:50:10.840]  I put up my own stuff, but others do as well.
[2:50:10.840 --> 2:50:11.840]  Check it out.
[2:50:11.840 --> 2:50:12.840]  It is well worth seeing.
[2:50:12.840 --> 2:50:13.840]  Thank you, Roger.
[2:50:13.840 --> 2:50:15.440]  Yeah, that's really the problem with band.video.
[2:50:15.440 --> 2:50:18.280]  We started it two years ago to really put our videos up.
[2:50:18.280 --> 2:50:20.440]  The other folks reached out and said, hey, I'm being banned.
[2:50:20.440 --> 2:50:21.440]  Can we have a site?
[2:50:21.440 --> 2:50:23.440]  So now we have hundreds of contributors.
[2:50:23.440 --> 2:50:26.280]  And the average video probably gets five to a thousand views, which is great compared
[2:50:26.280 --> 2:50:27.480]  to YouTube or whatever.
[2:50:27.480 --> 2:50:28.480]  I'm not competition people.
[2:50:28.480 --> 2:50:29.480]  I just want free speech.
[2:50:29.480 --> 2:50:34.720]  But we have so many contributors now, like the average video is up to like 20,000 views.
[2:50:34.720 --> 2:50:36.840]  Greg Reese is probably the all-time star there.
[2:50:36.840 --> 2:50:40.360]  His average video is about a million views now.
[2:50:40.360 --> 2:50:43.160]  And my average video gets about 100,000.
[2:50:43.160 --> 2:50:45.080]  And we're just churning them out, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:50:45.080 --> 2:50:48.920]  So there's just so many great contributors, so much banned material there that nobody
[2:50:48.920 --> 2:50:50.520]  wants you to see.
[2:50:50.520 --> 2:50:57.120]  And just all the great shows and more Roger Stone's whole site is right there.
[2:50:57.120 --> 2:51:00.280]  So I just want to encourage everybody to keep spreading the word about band.video.
[2:51:00.280 --> 2:51:07.280]  But remember, you can't share the URL from band.video on Twitter or Facebook.
[2:51:07.280 --> 2:51:08.280]  That URL is now blocked.
[2:51:08.280 --> 2:51:11.880]  So we have a new one that's the same site, same links, just lets you get it out.
[2:51:11.880 --> 2:51:12.880]  That is freeworldnews.tv.
[2:51:12.880 --> 2:51:18.960]  And that's why when we get guests on, we got to ask them to, hey, you're on the show
[2:51:18.960 --> 2:51:19.960]  live.
[2:51:19.960 --> 2:51:20.960]  Thank you.
[2:51:20.960 --> 2:51:21.960]  Tweet, Facebook, email, however you do it.
[2:51:21.960 --> 2:51:22.960]  Same thing with the listeners.
[2:51:22.960 --> 2:51:30.520]  You go to freeworldnews.tv, freeworldnews.tv, and then take the video or the live feed,
[2:51:30.520 --> 2:51:33.520]  whatever it is you want to share and share it from freeworldnews.tv.
[2:51:33.520 --> 2:51:35.600]  I'm sharing a few months.
[2:51:35.600 --> 2:51:38.040]  They'll ban freeworldnews.tv.
[2:51:38.040 --> 2:51:39.200]  We'll have a new URL.
[2:51:39.200 --> 2:51:41.040]  It's okay.
[2:51:41.040 --> 2:51:42.560]  But that's how we do this.
[2:51:42.560 --> 2:51:46.680]  And we get so many emails every day saying, can we repost your videos?
[2:51:46.680 --> 2:51:48.120]  Can we share your videos?
[2:51:48.120 --> 2:51:49.120]  Not just yes.
[2:51:49.120 --> 2:51:50.120]  Hell yes.
[2:51:50.120 --> 2:51:55.680]  Full, free to air, everything we do, just get it out.
[2:51:55.680 --> 2:51:59.520]  I get so many letters, can I pay them full wars on the side of my barn?
[2:51:59.520 --> 2:52:05.560]  If you don't have a zoning law in your area, hell yeah, I mean, look, we're in a war here.
[2:52:05.560 --> 2:52:11.960]  I'm not some corporation where if you paint Mickey Mouse on the side of the wall at your
[2:52:11.960 --> 2:52:14.120]  elementary school, we sue you.
[2:52:14.120 --> 2:52:19.680]  I don't give a rat's ass except about defeating the new world order.
[2:52:19.680 --> 2:52:20.800]  And that's what this comes down to.
[2:52:20.800 --> 2:52:27.320]  So also please support the broadcast, infowarstore.com, books, films, the trifecta of supplements
[2:52:27.320 --> 2:52:30.240]  for your immune system with these three new products we've got.
[2:52:30.240 --> 2:52:33.960]  It's all there, infowarstore.com.
[2:52:33.960 --> 2:52:34.960]  And that's it.
[2:52:34.960 --> 2:52:35.960]  All right.
[2:52:35.960 --> 2:52:42.320]  I got to get myself together because there is a lot to cover.
[2:52:42.320 --> 2:52:45.120]  The equation is very simple.
[2:52:45.120 --> 2:52:51.720]  The megamangs control the media, they control big pharma, they control academia, they control
[2:52:51.720 --> 2:52:57.160]  the military, industrial complex, they control big tech, and everywhere that they have been
[2:52:57.160 --> 2:53:04.960]  in control in the third world, they have established absolute total despotism and de-immunization.
[2:53:04.960 --> 2:53:10.560]  It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted
[2:53:10.560 --> 2:53:13.480]  women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[2:53:13.480 --> 2:53:19.000]  And because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opt it, turn it upside
[2:53:19.000 --> 2:53:26.400]  down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market
[2:53:26.400 --> 2:53:29.280]  that threatens their monopolies of control.
[2:53:29.280 --> 2:53:33.440]  That's why they target info wars because we understand the keys to defeating them.
[2:53:33.440 --> 2:53:39.040]  But the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that video.
[2:53:39.040 --> 2:53:40.040]  So redouble your efforts.
[2:53:40.040 --> 2:53:43.320]  We're all in this together.
[2:53:43.320 --> 2:53:50.000]  Big pharma was born out of the Rockefeller oil industry in 1900 with the petrochemical.
[2:53:50.000 --> 2:53:56.200]  The petrochemical then dominated two major industries, plastics and drugs.
[2:53:56.200 --> 2:54:01.400]  Companies began synthesizing patented versions of naturally sourced drugs.
[2:54:01.400 --> 2:54:04.920]  The natural sources were then made illegal.
[2:54:04.920 --> 2:54:09.720]  Pharmaceuticals became medicine and the sicker people got the more their industry grew.
[2:54:09.720 --> 2:54:14.080]  It's a death cult and it's up to the individual to escape.
[2:54:14.080 --> 2:54:20.520]  Good health begins with a healthy immune system which needs the proper nutrients to thrive.
[2:54:20.520 --> 2:54:24.040]  Nutrients we cannot readily get from our food today.
[2:54:24.040 --> 2:54:29.080]  The combinations of vitamin C and zinc and vitamin D3 with calcium have been proven to
[2:54:29.080 --> 2:54:33.400]  be what we need to maintain a healthy immune system.
[2:54:33.400 --> 2:54:38.520]  Go to infowarstore.com and start supporting your natural immune system now with the mega
[2:54:38.520 --> 2:54:46.400]  immune support pack now 40% off.
[2:54:46.400 --> 2:55:11.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show sometimes I start to show the best of moods end up bad
[2:55:11.080 --> 2:55:16.720]  mood as Rob do in the hall of telling me earlier man you're in a good mood now you're in a
[2:55:16.720 --> 2:55:18.600]  bad mood from the show.
[2:55:18.600 --> 2:55:21.760]  You know I appreciate listeners attuned to this show because you're not looking for
[2:55:21.760 --> 2:55:25.400]  lies you're looking for truth and the truth hurts sometimes but we got to admit that
[2:55:25.400 --> 2:55:28.720]  truth to get through the bad and you know make it a better world so I appreciate you
[2:55:28.720 --> 2:55:33.680]  all going through this just like I'm doing it and so many days at the end of the show
[2:55:33.680 --> 2:55:40.240]  I've got like the most powerful stuff we had I haven't hit yet because I've already looked
[2:55:40.240 --> 2:55:43.600]  at it two or three times and it's already got me pissed.
[2:55:43.600 --> 2:55:47.520]  You know I'm almost tempted to like do like a six hour show where I do research and see
[2:55:47.520 --> 2:55:52.120]  stuff for the first time and like I play a clip or listeners sends a clip and then we
[2:55:52.120 --> 2:55:57.400]  experience at the same time together you know what I mean because Russell Brands is a smart
[2:55:57.400 --> 2:56:01.800]  guy he's been on the show before he's a big listener he makes some great points but it
[2:56:01.800 --> 2:56:05.920]  makes me mad at big pharma they're doing this but nevertheless a lot of folks haven't seen
[2:56:05.920 --> 2:56:11.120]  this clip from his hit podcast yesterday so let's go ahead and play it here's Russell
[2:56:11.120 --> 2:56:17.120]  Brand talking about big pharma and how it controls the government response what they're
[2:56:17.120 --> 2:56:19.600]  trying to make mandatory here it is.
[2:56:19.600 --> 2:56:26.480]  Again a report in 2017 showed that with the exception of CBS every American major media
[2:56:26.480 --> 2:56:32.200]  outlet shared at least one board member with at least one pharmaceutical company that means
[2:56:32.200 --> 2:56:37.160]  there's literal physical crossovers between the media and pharmaceutical companies the
[2:56:37.160 --> 2:56:43.920]  same human beings furthermore drug companies spent five billion a year on advertising with
[2:56:43.920 --> 2:56:49.480]  these media outlets consider the amount of profits that Pfizer are likely to make from
[2:56:49.480 --> 2:56:55.480]  the vaccines Moderna was a company in a lot of trouble before these vaccines came about
[2:56:55.480 --> 2:56:59.840]  and Johnson and Johnson are going to need every penny they make from the vaccines to
[2:56:59.840 --> 2:57:05.320]  pay for lawsuits coming about as a result of their talcum powder causing cancer and it
[2:57:05.320 --> 2:57:12.800]  does make me think they can't manage talcum powder that made it easier for many scientists
[2:57:12.800 --> 2:57:17.760]  to dismiss the lab scenario as tin hat nonsense doesn't it make you think what other things
[2:57:17.760 --> 2:57:23.160]  that are being dismissed as tin hat nonsense are also potentially true doesn't it make
[2:57:23.160 --> 2:57:28.640]  you realize that what's necessary from the media is not a total line in accordance with
[2:57:28.640 --> 2:57:33.560]  their big partnerships with pharmaceutical companies and their relationships with government
[2:57:33.560 --> 2:57:40.400]  but to commit themselves to truth otherwise you can't trust them on anything and again
[2:57:40.400 --> 2:57:45.600]  I want to thank the listeners for keeping us on air because without you we wouldn't
[2:57:45.600 --> 2:57:50.080]  have influenced Russell Brandt and I'm not bragging to go oh I helped wake up Russell
[2:57:50.080 --> 2:57:56.600]  Brandt back when he was married to Katy Perry but that's what he told me first I got told
[2:57:56.600 --> 2:58:01.480]  it by Katy Perry's dad wanted to come on after they already got divorced and I guess Russell
[2:58:01.480 --> 2:58:05.880]  kind of tried to wake her up she ran off and got into the occultism and stuff but Russell
[2:58:05.880 --> 2:58:10.760]  woke up from our show came on the show we've done interviews hung out before but the point
[2:58:10.760 --> 2:58:18.440]  is is that it was this broadcast 10 11 years ago that woke up Russell Brandt and now where
[2:58:18.440 --> 2:58:26.280]  is Russell Brandt today and again if you weren't spreading the word if you weren't supporting
[2:58:26.280 --> 2:58:31.160]  us this wouldn't have happened so pretty much anybody we play a clip of it's fighting hard
[2:58:31.160 --> 2:58:35.680]  most of the doctors and scientists we get on what first woke you up well your show or
[2:58:35.680 --> 2:58:43.160]  Chris Guy what woke you up your show it's not my show it's the guests it's the callers
[2:58:43.160 --> 2:58:52.360]  it's the reach it's you breathing life into this broadcast that got all of that information
[2:58:52.360 --> 2:58:56.840]  out by the way Russell Brandt's like an NBA player he's so damn tall yeah this is one
[2:58:56.840 --> 2:59:02.480]  of the interviews I did with him so when it turns to me I was like a midget I am like
[2:59:02.480 --> 2:59:10.120]  5 10 or 5 11 I stand up straight but I'm on it how tall I am but that's just another example
[2:59:10.120 --> 2:59:15.320]  ladies and gentlemen of how important you are and how you don't think you're doing something
[2:59:15.320 --> 2:59:19.960]  big when you email your family with a video clip or you share a link or you tell somebody
[2:59:19.960 --> 2:59:26.320]  about freeworldnews.com but when you do it you certainly do take action and change the
[2:59:26.320 --> 2:59:30.400]  world in fact this little short segment we should put one of my interviews with Russell
[2:59:30.400 --> 2:59:34.600]  Brandt on the end of that because that stuff has been taken off YouTube we can find it
[2:59:34.600 --> 2:59:38.880]  I didn't know we had it well I just found it over there we should tag that Russell Brandt
[2:59:38.880 --> 2:59:46.120]  interview by Alex Jones interview up and put it at band.tv because what is old is new alright
[2:59:46.120 --> 2:59:53.960]  stay with us back in 60 seconds not a secret why and left us controlled cities all over
[2:59:53.960 --> 2:59:58.680]  the world not just the U.S. they encourage people to live in tents and he's just homeless
[2:59:58.680 --> 3:00:02.600]  and he used drugs and alcohol and engaged in petty crime it's because the globalist
[3:00:02.600 --> 3:00:09.440]  admit under Agenda 21 Agenda 2030 of course the great reset they want to lower expectations
[3:00:09.440 --> 3:00:12.280]  they don't want you to think of having sanitary systems everywhere they don't want you to
[3:00:12.280 --> 3:00:16.200]  think of a civilization that gets better they want you to think of civilization that gets
[3:00:16.200 --> 3:00:21.840]  progressively worse the globalist fly around in private jets they have huge private mistakes
[3:00:21.840 --> 3:00:26.880]  they are separate from us their children go to private tutors they admit this now they
[3:00:26.880 --> 3:00:32.720]  want to lock down telecommunicating with each other so that we are not actually out physically
[3:00:32.720 --> 3:00:38.600]  building a pro human infrastructure infrastructure that's left under 5G is going to control robot
[3:00:38.600 --> 3:00:43.560]  autonomous cars and trucks this is all they're admitted plan the public's finally listening
[3:00:43.560 --> 3:00:48.320]  because the plan is no longer in beta it's gone operational it's a post human future
[3:00:48.320 --> 3:00:59.280]  you better find out about it right now the Alex Jones show because there is a war on
[3:00:59.280 --> 3:01:09.320]  for your mind the world is awakening big time thank you for joining us on this Thursday
[3:01:09.320 --> 3:01:17.920]  June 10th global transmission well here is the Australian member of parliament the prime
[3:01:17.920 --> 3:01:22.880]  minister Scott Morrison who's supposedly a conservative there's a lot of stuff against
[3:01:22.880 --> 3:01:29.000]  China and posing as carbon taxes but he's let the globalist lockdown happen he has accepted
[3:01:29.000 --> 3:01:33.880]  so much evil and now here he is saying you're going to have a vaccine passport to leave
[3:01:33.880 --> 3:01:39.160]  your house to have a job to travel and it's going to be attached to a government wallet
[3:01:39.160 --> 3:01:44.080]  so now what you buy and what you sell and what you do will be attached to this wallet
[3:01:44.080 --> 3:01:47.760]  and then once that's adopted they'll phase out all the other currencies that's what
[3:01:47.760 --> 3:01:54.400]  I told you years ago that's what Klaus Schwab admits on French TV is the plan a digital
[3:01:54.400 --> 3:02:01.720]  wallet and then RFID is sewn to your clothes and then implantable microchips under a world
[3:02:01.720 --> 3:02:07.200]  medical ID that's the holy grail for the global social credit score so it doesn't matter if
[3:02:07.200 --> 3:02:12.880]  he keeps China out of Australia Australia just becomes communist China by extension the big
[3:02:12.880 --> 3:02:20.040]  tech takeover so Scott Morrison is really a big big problem and of Canada and Australia
[3:02:20.040 --> 3:02:25.120]  and so many other countries fall to this digital ID control system they will make us adopted
[3:02:25.120 --> 3:02:31.600]  as well so we're all Australians today here is the Prime Minister.
[3:02:31.600 --> 3:02:35.160]  Vaccination certification and this has been a topic of some conversation over the past
[3:02:35.160 --> 3:02:42.360]  month the vaccination certification is already present within the services Australia system
[3:02:42.360 --> 3:02:48.160]  but it will soon be available through the Medicare app and ultimately in the form of
[3:02:48.160 --> 3:02:54.480]  a digital wallet that can be used by citizens that will be available in July there is already
[3:02:54.480 --> 3:03:00.120]  the Medicare reference that you can get through the Medicare app which we anticipate to be
[3:03:00.120 --> 3:03:02.680]  available this month.
[3:03:02.680 --> 3:03:07.680]  So he just slides it out there like it's no big deal digital wallet digital tracking digital
[3:03:07.680 --> 3:03:13.720]  control casual society social credit score for a fraudulent virus a power trip a fake
[3:03:13.720 --> 3:03:19.640]  PCR test ongoing martial law in major cities if one person gets COVID if one person gets
[3:03:19.640 --> 3:03:25.880]  a cold one person gets a flu it's tyranny it's total scientific control well Terry
[3:03:25.880 --> 3:03:30.760]  bought it is a member of parliament over in the Netherlands and I'm gonna have to read
[3:03:30.760 --> 3:03:35.920]  the transcript here or read the subtitles we need to get him on the show but if he can
[3:03:35.920 --> 3:03:41.560]  speak English but I can hear a lot of what he's saying I guess in that mix of French
[3:03:41.560 --> 3:03:47.680]  and German that is what they speak in the Netherlands but here he is this man spells
[3:03:47.680 --> 3:03:53.400]  out exactly what's happening now based on global plan created ten years ago operation
[3:03:53.400 --> 3:04:00.240]  lock step now being covered by Laura Ingram so I'll read this as fast as I can if I mess
[3:04:00.240 --> 3:04:05.040]  it up okay listeners know I'm not doing that on purpose just keep rolling it for TV viewers
[3:04:05.040 --> 3:04:09.120]  people can go to info wars.com and they can they can see him him him laid out for themselves
[3:04:09.120 --> 3:04:19.120]  but I'm gonna try to read this in live time with the captions go ahead and roll it for
[3:04:19.120 --> 3:04:26.320]  you there in 2010 the Rockefeller Foundation the Rockefeller Foundation even the most influential
[3:04:26.320 --> 3:04:32.840]  NGOs in the world developed scenarios for the future of technology and international
[3:04:32.840 --> 3:04:41.960]  development this report in this report Rockefeller Foundation describes the lock step scenario
[3:04:41.960 --> 3:04:48.800]  that describes and impending global pandemic and it's after math according to the scenario
[3:04:48.800 --> 3:04:55.640]  and I have it here with me the Chinese would start with mandatory quarantines for all citizens
[3:04:55.640 --> 3:05:03.120]  and an immediate and almost hermetically sealed closure of all borders national leaders across
[3:05:03.120 --> 3:05:10.680]  the world would reinforce their power laws regulations and restrictions from mass mandates
[3:05:10.680 --> 3:05:17.880]  to the body temperature checks at the interest of train stations airplane buildings is all
[3:05:17.880 --> 3:05:24.120]  in here but it does not stop at that lock step scenario there is a great deal more than
[3:05:24.120 --> 3:05:30.800]  a way such even after the pandemic was over right the researchers the authoritarian control
[3:05:30.800 --> 3:05:36.960]  and surveillance of citizens and their activities remained and was even intensified in this report
[3:05:36.960 --> 3:05:43.760]  from 2010 they even were self-sufficient hinted at climate lockdowns exactly what we are beginning
[3:05:43.760 --> 3:05:48.760]  to talk about right now and now I quote to protect themselves from problems and become
[3:05:48.760 --> 3:05:54.680]  even more global from the pandemic and transactional terrorism to clear up climate crisis increasing
[3:05:54.680 --> 3:06:00.680]  poverty leaders from across the world sees more and more power reports for such a report
[3:06:00.680 --> 3:06:08.400]  also foresaw how people would react to these measures regrettably just like now when people
[3:06:08.400 --> 3:06:14.840]  cheer what they are vaccinated and post pictures of their jobs on social media it's all in
[3:06:14.840 --> 3:06:21.120]  the report and I beg for a covid passport anticipated the riders the lock step scenario begging
[3:06:21.120 --> 3:06:28.040]  that the mere controler the world is the idea of a more controlled world would gain wide
[3:06:28.040 --> 3:06:33.920]  spread acceptance among the populace. Citizens willingly gave up a partner sovereignty and
[3:06:33.920 --> 3:06:39.920]  their privacy stability status is tolerant and eager to be subjugated to a more top down
[3:06:39.920 --> 3:06:48.440]  management national leaders had more freedom to bestow order in the ways than they saw fit
[3:06:48.440 --> 3:06:55.480]  this would lead to a digital passport and something they had foreseen a 2010 Rockefeller
[3:06:55.480 --> 3:07:01.120]  Foundation could now entirely dissipate the current technological advances but even they
[3:07:01.120 --> 3:07:05.840]  would already have thought titan surveillance would lead to a biometric idea for all services
[3:07:05.840 --> 3:07:15.440]  currently this is already beginning integrated into our passport. I would take 13 years for
[3:07:15.440 --> 3:07:24.320]  the public for the Rockefeller Foundation to become fed up with the amount of control
[3:07:24.320 --> 3:07:29.280]  and the absurd power fantasies of the rulers. I hope the Rockefeller Foundation is proven
[3:07:29.280 --> 3:07:35.600]  wrong on that account and their predictions have come true but I really hope they are
[3:07:35.600 --> 3:07:40.960]  wrong on this account. I would hope that there will be a moment that we all wake up and that
[3:07:40.960 --> 3:07:45.920]  we realize this is a collective psychosis that locking down the entire country and half
[3:07:45.920 --> 3:07:53.040]  the world for 1.5 years became a flu variety is insane. The walking around with those silly
[3:07:53.040 --> 3:07:58.080]  useless mask on is insanity and that we can form to completely senseless distancing rules
[3:07:58.080 --> 3:08:02.920]  that we will have businesses or hit pause. God the guy reads faster than I do back it
[3:08:02.920 --> 3:08:08.760]  up to 20 seconds. I thought I could keep up with this but he talks faster than I do so
[3:08:08.760 --> 3:08:14.760]  it's okay. Talking fast comes with high intelligence and he's reading off the transcript so let's
[3:08:14.760 --> 3:08:18.560]  put it back up and I'll try to read what he's saying. This is so important right here. For
[3:08:18.560 --> 3:08:24.320]  1.5 years because of a flu variety it is insane that walking around with those silly useless
[3:08:24.320 --> 3:08:32.920]  mask is insanity that we can form ourselves to. That those completely senseless distancing
[3:08:32.920 --> 3:08:38.480]  values that we have our businesses our society our lives have been destroyed yeah it's martial
[3:08:38.480 --> 3:08:50.840]  law. That we have held back effectively primary medicines such as ivermectin only to give
[3:08:50.840 --> 3:08:59.480]  those experimental vaccines the study of approved vaccines as soon as we could. That we now
[3:08:59.480 --> 3:09:07.000]  ramble on about how the infections are decreasing. Waltz at the exact same time last year like
[3:09:07.000 --> 3:09:12.680]  it does every year and then it will happen again this autumn exactly the new lockdowns
[3:09:12.680 --> 3:09:20.720]  come arrives and new infections occur. And now we pretend it happened because of COVID-19
[3:09:20.720 --> 3:09:29.360]  all that the thing that we use to call the flu has completely disappeared. I hope that
[3:09:29.360 --> 3:09:40.640]  we will realize that with the hysteria about this. Chinese flu as the pretext back it up
[3:09:40.640 --> 3:09:44.200]  again since we're going to do this just back it up take the cube down please. Chinese flu
[3:09:44.200 --> 3:09:48.920]  as a pretext an entire infrastructure has been built yeah this infrastructure is the
[3:09:48.920 --> 3:09:58.480]  takeover plan continue an infrastructure that can be used again at any moment. Due to any
[3:09:58.480 --> 3:10:09.000]  occurrence lockdowns mass social distancing. No more traveling no handshakes ridiculous.
[3:10:09.000 --> 3:10:23.000]  All jabs. The COVID phase has been a practice to train obedience. Wow really kick ass information
[3:10:23.000 --> 3:10:28.040]  and we'll post that I spoke to a better job of it but I didn't live on there. Great job
[3:10:28.040 --> 3:10:33.600]  with the crew Matt Bracken takes over in full war store dot com only you can defeat the globalist

[3:10:51.000 --> 3:10:56.080]  your enemies. They're the globalist they're the starmasks. They are a consortium of bad
[3:10:56.080 --> 3:11:01.360]  scientists pedophiles control freaks devil worshipers. Vampires wherever you want to call
[3:11:01.360 --> 3:11:08.600]  them that are highly predatory and are setting up a false fantasy land system of constant
[3:11:08.600 --> 3:11:16.960]  bombardment of propaganda drugs and electromagnetic radiation to change the very DNA of the human
[3:11:16.960 --> 3:11:23.840]  species to mutate us into a form that they can control like a pawn on a chessboard. The
[3:11:23.840 --> 3:11:28.800]  bottom line is they want to play God they are playing God and the news is only going
[3:11:28.800 --> 3:11:32.960]  to tie it around our necks from here on out. So many other people want to be positive they
[3:11:32.960 --> 3:11:36.840]  want to put out fake news and want to only cover limited amounts of what's happening
[3:11:36.840 --> 3:11:40.760]  with the world order but at the end of the day it's all about the population it's all
[3:11:40.760 --> 3:11:45.200]  about world government it's all about the end of human system as we know it and on its

[3:15:10.120 --> 3:15:14.800]  play God but the other day they're not God and God's gonna take them very low. Alex Jones
[3:15:14.800 --> 3:15:18.160]  back here while we're working on some technical difficulties with Matt Bracken who was able
[3:15:18.160 --> 3:15:24.480]  to just connect so via the great magic of skype the computers will be handed the baton
[3:15:24.480 --> 3:15:28.960]  to the former Navy SEAL and bestselling author enemiesfarmdomestic.com here in a moment but
[3:15:28.960 --> 3:15:33.080]  here's another big article at info wars.com I said I'd get to that I wasn't getting to
[3:15:33.080 --> 3:15:38.680]  that's just as important as anything we've covered in the last week. Florida urologists
[3:15:38.680 --> 3:15:45.920]  find signs of infertility and prostate cancer in men jabbed with the COVID-19 vaccines which
[3:15:45.920 --> 3:15:51.520]  they warned you up front it would take all the tissues testicles prostate breast uteruses
[3:15:51.520 --> 3:15:58.840]  ovaries that are associated with similar proteins because they're fast growing cells ovaries
[3:15:58.840 --> 3:16:04.080]  all this stuff uterus testicles and cause an autoimmune response a swelling which they
[3:16:04.080 --> 3:16:11.160]  then call cancer. So what the doctor saying is already in the literature. So here it is.
[3:16:11.160 --> 3:16:15.520]  Gower Benowitz is asking all of his patients to keep track of when they received the COVID-19
[3:16:15.520 --> 3:16:21.680]  vaccine after linking the shot to elevated PSA levels. I have seen as patients PSA to
[3:16:21.680 --> 3:16:27.480]  be falsely elevated for at least six weeks after getting the vaccines. PSA levels are
[3:16:27.480 --> 3:16:31.440]  looked at with the basic blood tests and elevated levels are typically found in men
[3:16:31.440 --> 3:16:36.680]  with prostate cancer but PSA can be falsely elevated due to a number of conditions. Other
[3:16:36.680 --> 3:16:42.520]  things that can cause an elevation or an increase in the PSA are for example a urinary tract
[3:16:42.520 --> 3:16:51.600]  infection or a vigorous exercise in any other condition or illness. New anecdotal findings
[3:16:51.600 --> 3:16:56.480]  show that men who get the vaccine and then have their PSA levels also show a spike. I
[3:16:56.480 --> 3:17:03.480]  was seeing patients that were coming in with a history of having a stable PSA and all the
[3:17:03.480 --> 3:17:08.640]  sudden the PSA had risen. The urologist looked back to see if any other patients had similar
[3:17:08.640 --> 3:17:13.960]  issues and soon connected the dots. Sure enough I've had a few patients that have had the
[3:17:13.960 --> 3:17:19.480]  vaccine shortly before the PSA. Dr. Benowitz says that his patients were initially alarmed
[3:17:19.480 --> 3:17:25.000]  but after retesting weeks later his patients PSA levels normalized. These are the results
[3:17:25.000 --> 3:17:29.840]  of a patient who will remain anonymous. As you can see the person's PSA levels remain
[3:17:29.840 --> 3:17:38.040]  stable at 0.4 but a month later after taking the vaccine that person's levels raised nine
[3:17:38.040 --> 3:17:47.720]  times to 3.4. After retaking the test one additional time after that they fell back down to 1.5.
[3:17:47.720 --> 3:17:51.400]  The findings are similar to physicians who were concerned after finding swollen lymph
[3:17:51.400 --> 3:17:56.280]  nodes when women went for a mammogram soon after vaccination. Certainly this is not the
[3:17:56.280 --> 3:18:00.320]  reason for people not to get the vaccine and that's not what we're saying at all. What
[3:18:00.320 --> 3:18:05.120]  we're saying is to take into account the effect the vaccine can have. The month of
[3:18:05.120 --> 3:18:09.600]  June is men's health month. An important reminder to say on top of appointments as prostate
[3:18:09.600 --> 3:18:14.480]  cancer for example is the most common. Let's stop right there. Oh no like Menstein said
[3:18:14.480 --> 3:18:18.320]  I almost died but still take it and people's family died of the vaccine. Oh still take
[3:18:18.320 --> 3:18:22.480]  it. Yeah it shows a chemical that means you got cancer and they told you up front it's
[3:18:22.480 --> 3:18:26.160]  going to make your uterus swell up and all this but it's okay. It's causing heart attacks
[3:18:26.160 --> 3:18:32.040]  and death but hey it's approved by the FDA under an emergency authorization by a guy
[3:18:32.040 --> 3:18:37.920]  Bill Gates that says he wants to depopulate you and your family. I know this if your cells
[3:18:37.920 --> 3:18:41.920]  aren't getting the vitamins and nutrients they need any virus can go in and manipulate
[3:18:41.920 --> 3:18:46.960]  their replication and take them over. Just like when your whole body is weighed down
[3:18:46.960 --> 3:18:55.160]  and you're malnourished you die easier or you get sick easier. So many people are getting
[3:18:55.160 --> 3:19:00.600]  sick from whatever because they're malnourished. That's why sunlight, water, prayer does stuff
[3:19:00.600 --> 3:19:05.080]  for your immune system. Getting closer to God. Higher residents in your consciousness
[3:19:05.080 --> 3:19:10.880]  touching God. Studies show that and vitamins and minerals and all the basic things and
[3:19:10.880 --> 3:19:14.840]  listen I've been promoting vitamins and minerals long before COVID-19 came along just like
[3:19:14.840 --> 3:19:19.040]  I promote clean water and air. You need water and air, you die in like five minutes without
[3:19:19.040 --> 3:19:23.520]  air, you die about a week and a half without water, about a month without food because
[3:19:23.520 --> 3:19:28.200]  what's food having? Nutrients. Well the supplements we sell are concentrated nutrients. We have
[3:19:28.200 --> 3:19:32.520]  the new multivitamins from Whole Foods sources. We have the new vitamin D3 from Whole Foods
[3:19:32.520 --> 3:19:39.320]  sources and we have the new Super C 1100 times the daily allowance or 1100% of your daily

[3:25:47.960 --> 3:26:13.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show live from Austin, Texas broadcasting
[3:26:13.320 --> 3:26:20.200]  worldwide. It's Alex Jones and now your host Matt Bracken.
[3:26:25.000 --> 3:26:32.200]  Yeah I'm sorry there's uh some kind of a technical hassle with my camera output today so
[3:26:33.960 --> 3:26:42.280]  until we can get this fixed we're going to just go with my voice. I had some ideas about this uh
[3:26:42.280 --> 3:26:51.000]  the whole COVID-19 and the vaccine push which I'm a boomer, I'm a late boomer born in the late 50s.
[3:26:51.000 --> 3:26:57.400]  I lived through everything from as a baby you know McCarthyism you could say even
[3:26:58.200 --> 3:27:04.840]  and I've never seen a propaganda push like getting everybody injected with this experimental
[3:27:04.840 --> 3:27:12.280]  gene therapy, never in my life, nothing even close. This is in some ways scarier than the
[3:27:12.280 --> 3:27:18.520]  Soviet Union. I know that they put political prisoners in gulags and they put some political
[3:27:18.520 --> 3:27:25.960]  prisoners in psychiatric, psychiatric institutes but I don't remember them ever forcing an
[3:27:25.960 --> 3:27:33.000]  experimental drug on their entire population. At the end of the Second World War the world
[3:27:33.000 --> 3:27:39.400]  was pretty horrified to find out what the Nazis had been up to including in the area of medical
[3:27:39.400 --> 3:27:47.400]  experimentation on obviously unwilling and unconcenting prisoners in their in their
[3:27:47.400 --> 3:27:55.160]  concentration camps. So part of what the Nuremberg tribunal came up with was what's called the
[3:27:55.160 --> 3:28:03.480]  Nuremberg Code and this is almost you could say like passed down from mount the mountain like
[3:28:03.480 --> 3:28:10.440]  Moses with the Ten Commandments. This was black and white you know black letter law for what would
[3:28:10.440 --> 3:28:20.760]  be considered illegal, immoral and unethical forever to force people to do and the the experimental
[3:28:20.760 --> 3:28:30.680]  mRNA COVID jab would absolutely be considered coming under an experimental drug. It's never
[3:28:30.680 --> 3:28:37.640]  been released, the FDA was bull rushed into into signing it. If you've ever seen the video of the
[3:28:38.440 --> 3:28:44.280]  conference call between the FDA eyes it was basically shut up we're going to approve this
[3:28:44.280 --> 3:28:52.760]  today no matter what and I think that this will go down as one of Trump's biggest mistakes being
[3:28:52.760 --> 3:28:59.320]  being pushed and rushed into what he was very proud of calling it operation warp speed
[3:28:59.960 --> 3:29:05.560]  but I think that he was really suckered you know maybe as a businessman he trusted the big
[3:29:05.560 --> 3:29:12.040]  pharma companies and maybe for sure he trusted our own government bureaucrats way too much
[3:29:12.040 --> 3:29:20.360]  but it's obvious just like Fauci has always been pushing gain of function research even when it was
[3:29:20.360 --> 3:29:28.040]  banned from the United States of America as being too dangerous he snuck money into the Wuhan lab
[3:29:28.040 --> 3:29:38.440]  to continue this gain of function research in 2012 he even said paraphrasing that the risks of doing
[3:29:38.440 --> 3:29:46.440]  it are outweighed by the by the potential knowledge gained the risk of a pandemic is not as as
[3:29:46.440 --> 3:29:53.560]  important as the knowledge gained kind of reminds me of of eating from the tree of knowledge you
[3:29:53.560 --> 3:30:01.880]  know the man's fallen nature the hubris of Anthony Fauci I think he's trying to go down in history
[3:30:01.880 --> 3:30:13.080]  as one of the greatest medicos up with like Pasteur and and Jenner and Salk you know one
[3:30:13.080 --> 3:30:20.520]  of the most famous medical breakthroughs would be on his watch and he just was willing to take any
[3:30:20.520 --> 3:30:28.040]  chance this thing got out it was then weaponized by the Chinese they let people fly out and we're
[3:30:28.040 --> 3:30:36.120]  and even last January and February when this pandemic was just getting out Fauci was standing
[3:30:36.120 --> 3:30:43.400]  up there and and saying it was definitely a zoonotic origin while he was at the exact same time
[3:30:43.960 --> 3:30:50.840]  trying to squelch the knowledge about the lab gain of function research so that the Nuremberg
[3:30:50.840 --> 3:30:56.760]  code was designed to prevent things like this but I don't think they ever dreamed that it would be
[3:30:56.760 --> 3:31:06.120]  the so-called vaccines given literally to billions of humans and this is not a vaccine by any definition
[3:31:06.120 --> 3:31:14.360]  before 2020 this is an an experimental injection and I'm going to read from the Nuremberg code now
[3:31:15.720 --> 3:31:22.440]  it says the voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential this means
[3:31:22.440 --> 3:31:28.120]  that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent should be situated
[3:31:28.120 --> 3:31:35.880]  to be able to exercise free power of choice without the intervention of any element of force fraud
[3:31:35.880 --> 3:31:43.480]  deceit duress overreaching or any other alternative ulterior form of constraint or coercion
[3:31:44.440 --> 3:31:49.160]  and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject
[3:31:49.160 --> 3:31:56.200]  matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision this
[3:31:56.200 --> 3:32:04.200]  none of this was done this was all based on lies the entire thing was based on lies they lied about
[3:32:04.200 --> 3:32:10.360]  it not being gain of function a bio weapon they are and now they're lying about the injection
[3:32:10.360 --> 3:32:18.520]  calling it a vaccine they rushed this thing through it's not a vaccine it's a messenger RNA
[3:32:18.520 --> 3:32:28.200]  synthetic injection it's a synthetic molecule whipped up in mega doses in big pharma labs
[3:32:28.760 --> 3:32:35.560]  and shipped out to the world and don't think don't fall for the idea that the vaccine is free
[3:32:35.560 --> 3:32:43.240]  the vaccine is not free that we are paying for it with our own tax dollars and we are and we're
[3:32:43.240 --> 3:32:50.040]  going to pay for it later with our health now I have not taken it and I won't take it and and I
[3:32:50.040 --> 3:32:56.920]  now that the most disgusting thing is watching it being pushed down in age in Florida they're
[3:32:56.920 --> 3:33:02.920]  giving it to 15 year olds and soon they're going to be giving it to five year olds five year olds
[3:33:02.920 --> 3:33:11.000]  cannot give consent for something that could sterilize them give them give them brainbleeds
[3:33:11.000 --> 3:33:16.920]  give them myocarditis I mean this is just an unbelievable thing that's happening for the
[3:33:16.920 --> 3:33:23.000]  the greed of the big pharma companies and I believe also for Bill Gates ulterior motive
[3:33:23.480 --> 3:33:30.120]  of of population control you know if you watch the one of the most important documentaries
[3:33:30.120 --> 3:33:36.680]  I've ever seen in my life is by James Corbett of the Corbett report called who is Bill Gates
[3:33:36.680 --> 3:33:44.360]  Bill Gates has been about this for his entire life he's been trying to inject people with
[3:33:44.920 --> 3:33:52.520]  with bogus vaccines for decades and he's very involved in this not only from the medical side
[3:33:53.160 --> 3:33:57.080]  but from the data analysis side they're trying to get
[3:33:57.640 --> 3:34:03.800]  taggants into these vaccines where they'll be able to tell who is and who isn't vaccinated
[3:34:03.800 --> 3:34:10.920]  and with which variety of vaccine just by scanning your arm I mean this is no joke
[3:34:10.920 --> 3:34:17.560]  this is happening I would urge everybody to watch James Corbett Corbett report now
[3:34:17.560 --> 3:34:25.000]  going back to the Nuremberg thing it says that the experiment should be such as to yield fruitful
[3:34:25.000 --> 3:34:35.320]  results for the good of society un procurable by other methods okay that means when they suppressed
[3:34:35.320 --> 3:34:42.600]  the efficacy of hydrochloroquine and and ivermectin and other other therapeutics
[3:34:42.600 --> 3:34:50.360]  they did this knowingly they they sentenced millions of people to die by by forbidding
[3:34:50.360 --> 3:34:57.640]  doctors to prescribe known beneficial therapeutics so that they could push this these these fake
[3:34:57.640 --> 3:35:04.680]  vaccines through with an emergency use authorization the only way they could get the emergency
[3:35:04.680 --> 3:35:13.240]  authorization is by claiming that there was no other therapeutic this was a lie and at some point
[3:35:13.240 --> 3:35:21.080]  people are going to have to pay now i've watched some amazing videos also lately by a dr michael
[3:35:21.080 --> 3:35:30.520]  yeiden i think it's spelled um y e a d o n he's a brit he worked for fizer for 16 years and became
[3:35:30.520 --> 3:35:37.640]  a senior vice president when he left fizer he started his own company which a few years later
[3:35:37.640 --> 3:35:46.840]  he was able to sell for $370 million and why is that important it's important because he doesn't

[3:39:00.920 --> 3:39:08.760]  is a reckoning it's god giving us a chance to work things out the third dimension so we can
[3:39:08.760 --> 3:39:13.400]  decide where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to and it really does come
[3:39:13.400 --> 3:39:18.520]  down to that so as sad as things are and as evil as things are look at all the good in the world as
[3:39:18.520 --> 3:39:24.520]  well and realize that god is the author of our consciousness god is the author of us having
[3:39:24.520 --> 3:39:31.720]  our own will god is the author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing
[3:39:32.280 --> 3:39:37.080]  when you look at mainstream media in hollywood this whole evil culture in washington bc and
[3:39:37.080 --> 3:39:42.600]  fouchy and the and the mass cult it's all about dominating your free will it's all about telling
[3:39:42.600 --> 3:39:46.280]  you you're dirty you're ugly you're in the bad because satan hates you because you're made in
[3:39:46.280 --> 3:39:58.520]  the image of god the creator of the universe you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:40:05.640 --> 3:40:11.800]  i think we got it worked out you know there's maybe nothing it's hard to imagine anything
[3:40:11.800 --> 3:40:21.080]  more important dangerous vital than this injection being forced on us here in florida fortunately we
[3:40:21.080 --> 3:40:27.400]  have a governor with some backbone and he has stood up for example to the cruise ship industry
[3:40:27.400 --> 3:40:34.040]  which is major industry in this state and said no you will not force people to take the vaccines if
[3:40:34.040 --> 3:40:39.560]  you want to do business in florida but this is obviously going to be a major battle because in
[3:40:39.560 --> 3:40:47.000]  the other corner of the united states in washington state headquarters of amazon amazon employees
[3:40:47.000 --> 3:40:54.200]  and i don't just mean the drivers i mean the the the package handlers uh the shippers they are now
[3:40:54.200 --> 3:41:00.760]  being forced to take the vaccine not quite forced but the people that have had the vaccine and i mean
[3:41:00.760 --> 3:41:07.080]  not honor system they have to prove they've got the vaccines they get a special green stamp on their
[3:41:07.080 --> 3:41:14.680]  id badge that's visible all the time anybody who hasn't been vaccinated has to wear a mask
[3:41:14.680 --> 3:41:20.200]  sort of like the lepers and the you know the clean and the unclean and the lepers and the
[3:41:20.200 --> 3:41:26.200]  healthy people this is really disgusting well amazon does a lot of business in florida so it's
[3:41:26.200 --> 3:41:32.600]  going to be interesting to see how this trickles down you know to uh to every town in the united
[3:41:32.600 --> 3:41:40.200]  states personally i won't take it no matter what i mean these spike proteins that are injected into
[3:41:40.200 --> 3:41:46.600]  your body the plan for the spike protein they're not just going into your lung tissue to block
[3:41:46.600 --> 3:41:54.760]  future uh wild covid these this messenger RNA that that builds these spike proteins in your body
[3:41:55.320 --> 3:42:01.240]  these go into your brain and other blood cells causing these clots and bleeding i mean this
[3:42:01.240 --> 3:42:08.040]  this is this is a horrible thing they also go you know into the testicles the ovaries it's hard to
[3:42:08.040 --> 3:42:14.200]  imagine any good anything good to come out of this especially when they say even if you've been
[3:42:14.200 --> 3:42:19.880]  vaccinated you know you still should wear the mask or even if you've been vaccinated you shouldn't
[3:42:19.880 --> 3:42:25.640]  be around other people i mean it it doesn't make any sense they're doing this to the military too
[3:42:25.640 --> 3:42:30.840]  saying if you don't get vaccinated you can't go and leave you can't deploy they're basically
[3:42:30.840 --> 3:42:37.640]  making second-class citizens out of the unvaccinated and it's for no good purpose but now while we're
[3:42:37.640 --> 3:42:44.600]  all watching this this um the covid so closely something else is happening in our country that's
[3:42:45.160 --> 3:42:53.000]  maybe long term even more dangerous like at like a a house where you know we're looking out the
[3:42:53.000 --> 3:42:59.720]  window while the cellar is flooding and a mudslide is coming because we're all staring at the shiny
[3:42:59.720 --> 3:43:07.160]  object and it's a dangerous shiny object you know covid and the jab but we are being invaded we are
[3:43:07.160 --> 3:43:16.120]  literally being invaded two million per year is the new estimate this is why camala won't go to the
[3:43:16.120 --> 3:43:23.480]  border this is why she's talking about climate change in guatemala and root causes that democrats
[3:43:23.480 --> 3:43:31.080]  are welcoming this invasion the problem is the people that are invading will never be loyal to
[3:43:31.080 --> 3:43:37.160]  this country they're coming for purely mercenary reasons from all over the world they're not just
[3:43:37.160 --> 3:43:42.280]  coming from the northern triangle they're coming from all over south america they're coming from
[3:43:42.280 --> 3:43:50.280]  as far away as bangladesh and romania people are flying to central america and to mexico
[3:43:50.280 --> 3:43:57.640]  to cross the border these are people that are being paid with with ngo money most of which you
[3:43:57.640 --> 3:44:04.280]  could link back to soros somebody from bangladesh getting off the airplane in ecuador you know and
[3:44:04.280 --> 3:44:10.520]  then getting transportation all the way to the american border this is not just happening organically
[3:44:11.160 --> 3:44:19.320]  this is being funded and the purpose of it is to wreck america the the one thing that is absolutely
[3:44:19.320 --> 3:44:26.520]  certain about the illegals that are being welcomed by the democrats and then bust an airplane all over
[3:44:26.520 --> 3:44:34.360]  america the one thing for sure about them is that they're going to vote democrat because the democrats
[3:44:34.360 --> 3:44:40.520]  will promise to keep the borders open and let the rest of their family in so there's no chance these
[3:44:40.520 --> 3:44:48.600]  people will ever vote republican they they will not only vote democrat they will multiply exponentially
[3:44:48.600 --> 3:44:54.200]  because their main goal in life will be to get the rest of their family into the country and that
[3:44:54.200 --> 3:45:01.960]  chain migration never ever ends but worst of all and this is this is very knowing by the democrats
[3:45:03.160 --> 3:45:09.000]  these are not the brightest people in the world we're not getting the the doctors and architects
[3:45:09.000 --> 3:45:16.440]  from bangladesh we're getting people who are not really functional in a modern technological society
[3:45:16.440 --> 3:45:24.920]  you know unfortunately a lot of life really does boil down to iq and i'm you know that might sound
[3:45:24.920 --> 3:45:30.280]  harsh or cold or everybody's raised with these you know airy fairy you know oh there's all kinds
[3:45:30.280 --> 3:45:37.000]  of intelligence well let me tell you the united states military won't even take a recruit with
[3:45:37.000 --> 3:45:44.680]  an iq of under about 86 because he's just not worth training you can spend months to teach him to take
[3:45:44.680 --> 3:45:52.840]  a rifle apart and he'll probably still you know mess it mess it up so the u.s military well until
[3:45:52.840 --> 3:45:58.440]  now of course now they're recruiting anybody with a pulse especially if they're you know from the left
[3:45:58.440 --> 3:46:05.400]  and haven't lived an alternative lifestyle but until very recently the u.s military was very
[3:46:05.400 --> 3:46:11.880]  practical about this the people that are coming are coming from countries where the iq the average
[3:46:11.880 --> 3:46:20.280]  iq average iq is below 85 we do not need more street sweepers we have more than enough of our own
[3:46:21.000 --> 3:46:27.400]  and there are there are no countries on the planet no democracies rather on the planet
[3:46:28.200 --> 3:46:35.000]  that have an iq of under about 95 that are successful countries once you drop below
[3:46:35.000 --> 3:46:44.680]  around 95 every nation that that has an election becomes a farce it becomes venezuela because
[3:46:44.680 --> 3:46:52.520]  basically morons will always vote for the you know the the budding dictator that promises them
[3:46:52.520 --> 3:47:00.840]  free stuff they're not smart enough to understand that there is no free stuff money tree so the
[3:47:00.840 --> 3:47:07.400]  democrats are deliberately dumbing down our country you're not only with the curricula in
[3:47:07.400 --> 3:47:14.520]  our in our schools for the last 30 or 40 years but they're now doing it by deliberately importing
[3:47:14.520 --> 3:47:21.720]  people who will never be smart enough to contribute to our society because we basically we have enough
[3:47:22.360 --> 3:47:30.760]  dummies in our country more dummies in our country means our iq is sliding down and down and down
[3:47:30.760 --> 3:47:39.720]  meanwhile the iq in in uh japan korea and china is still over 100 this is why they have functioning
[3:47:39.720 --> 3:47:48.760]  societies the average person in japan or korea or increasingly even china gets it they understand
[3:47:48.760 --> 3:47:56.120]  the value of education of discipline and thrift people that your country is where the iq begins
[3:47:56.120 --> 3:48:02.520]  to just slide down into the you know into the lower regions wind up eventually if you know if
[3:48:02.520 --> 3:48:10.360]  you just correlate iq to national success and it's like a very strong correlation like a one to one
[3:48:10.360 --> 3:48:17.880]  correlation the dumbest countries in the world like samalia are the most dysfunctional the
[3:48:17.880 --> 3:48:25.800]  countries with the highest iq have the highest gdp and there there's one glaring case that's
[3:48:25.800 --> 3:48:33.080]  really important that has very important ramifications china has a relatively high iq they
[3:48:33.080 --> 3:48:39.960]  probably exaggerate that you know but it's still you know i would almost certainly say it's still
[3:48:39.960 --> 3:48:50.360]  over 100 and with 1.4 billion chinese the number of really smart chinese with iqs over 120 and 130
[3:48:50.360 --> 3:48:59.080]  is in the hundreds of millions that means hundreds of millions of engineers of future computer
[3:48:59.080 --> 3:49:05.240]  scientists you know of future mining engineers and and you know all kind of technological experts
[3:49:06.280 --> 3:49:12.760]  as they as these people are educated and have a higher standard of living meanwhile america is
[3:49:12.760 --> 3:49:21.400]  is importing millions of essentially you know borderline morons who will only vote for more free
[3:49:21.400 --> 3:49:29.160]  stuff you can see these trends how they're going to pull away you know 1.4 billion chinese led by
[3:49:29.160 --> 3:49:35.560]  a brain trust of hundreds of millions of what we would consider geniuses we're not going to compete
[3:49:35.560 --> 3:49:44.200]  with them when our iq is dropping below 95 we are on our way to third world status and on the
[3:49:44.200 --> 3:49:51.160]  way to third world we're going to probably go through a couple of little rough patches obviously
[3:49:51.160 --> 3:49:58.360]  the left appears to be gearing up for some kind of genocide i've also never seen in my life anything
[3:49:58.360 --> 3:50:06.040]  like the constant anti-white rhetoric you know this rhetoric isn't just something that's an academic
[3:50:06.040 --> 3:50:13.400]  issue to talk about on on you know on television this is having real world consequences when you
[3:50:13.400 --> 3:50:20.760]  see pictures of minorities particularly blacks just walking up to white people or asians and
[3:50:20.760 --> 3:50:29.400]  punching them this is this is something new this is really accelerating they're hearing every day
[3:50:29.400 --> 3:50:52.040]  constantly white people are evil oppressors and we're going to reap the whirlwind for this
