[00:00.000 --> 00:12.800]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.800 --> 00:21.560]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.560 --> 00:35.840]  well it's already starting to get people's attention but not as much
[00:35.840 --> 00:42.080]  attention as it should be garnering right now and of course I'm talking
[00:42.080 --> 00:49.720]  about the clear makings of what could potentially become a giant
[00:49.720 --> 00:54.680]  conflagration in the Middle East spilling into Central Asia Eastern Europe
[00:54.680 --> 01:01.520]  Russia Central and Western Europe and then that could easily domino into what
[01:01.520 --> 01:10.360]  they call World War 4 at the Pentagon because World War 3 was the Cold War
[01:10.360 --> 01:20.840]  and the Middle Eastern Wars the proxy Wars of the last 50 years World War 4
[01:20.840 --> 01:29.160]  is through proxy terror groups and his economic war cyber war proxy war but
[01:29.160 --> 01:35.440]  also expanding regional conflicts where actual armies of major world powers
[01:35.440 --> 01:41.920]  began to go toe-to-toe because proxy armies can only go so far I got up at
[01:41.920 --> 01:46.920]  about 6 a.m. this morning and continue to do deep research before coming into
[01:46.920 --> 01:54.160]  the office about 30 minutes ago and I was sitting here as we began to go live
[01:54.160 --> 02:01.400]  two minutes ago and I just do not even have words to describe how dangerous the
[02:01.400 --> 02:06.720]  situation is but I'm going to do my best to really come back the start of the
[02:06.720 --> 02:11.640]  next segment and lay out a presentation of exactly where we are if you are a
[02:11.640 --> 02:17.640]  long-time listener you know we've laid out precisely what was unfolding what
[02:17.640 --> 02:24.480]  was going to unfold and the different avenues we could be going down but you
[02:24.480 --> 02:30.840]  need to understand US military and NATO military forces have been fighting
[02:30.840 --> 02:40.080]  Russians for at least four years in Syria and for about two years in Ukraine and
[02:40.080 --> 02:43.480]  we have Bizarro statements in fact I forgot to tell the crew to get these
[02:43.480 --> 02:46.520]  you can get them take your time don't freak out because I'm springing this on
[02:46.520 --> 02:52.640]  you the retired US general the Fox News pundit saying we need to go ahead and
[02:52.640 --> 02:57.240]  start killing more Russians lots of dead Russians is the answer then the head
[02:57.240 --> 03:01.480]  NATO general said oh we can defeat the Russians real quick and real easy we're
[03:01.480 --> 03:05.240]  ready to crush them militarily and we're preparing to do so I mean it just
[03:05.240 --> 03:10.760]  chilling crazy town statements like you're a bully talking about here you
[03:10.760 --> 03:15.360]  know you're 15 you're gonna beat up a 10 year old just just shooting your
[03:15.360 --> 03:19.120]  mouth off kind of I mean even if you had that power to do that you wouldn't
[03:19.120 --> 03:24.060]  shoot your mouth off like that it's just unbelievable because now we have John
[03:24.060 --> 03:30.640]  McCain on Fox News yesterday saying now it's time to give service to air anti
[03:30.640 --> 03:37.920]  aircraft missiles to these supposed rebels there's the headline info wars
[03:37.920 --> 03:45.000]  calm McCain arm Syrian rebels to shoot down Russian planes just like we did in
[03:45.000 --> 03:51.880]  Afghanistan well back then you could say the Soviet Union was evil and corrupt
[03:51.880 --> 03:57.160]  but arming what became al-Qaeda we can see was certainly a bad idea now McCain
[03:57.160 --> 04:02.200]  meets with actual al-Qaeda that runs ISIS and that's in the news I'm gonna
[04:02.200 --> 04:07.760]  cover that in a moment huge news they're now admitting it and then now he says
[04:07.760 --> 04:15.160]  give weapons to people that are sworn to shoot down Western commercial aircraft
[04:15.160 --> 04:21.040]  so they've gone into Syria they started the war they can't win the war Chinese
[04:21.040 --> 04:27.240]  Iranian and Russian troops are landing daily massing Putin's preparing for all
[04:27.240 --> 04:35.960]  out war in Europe just drafted 150,000 conscripts today readying nuclear forces
[04:35.960 --> 04:40.420]  for nuclear war and you've got the average American talking about how proud
[04:40.420 --> 04:45.280]  they are a Caitlyn Jenner and how that's the new symbol of America this is
[04:45.280 --> 04:49.040]  called the complete setup of this country I'm gonna lay out exactly what
[04:49.040 --> 04:53.080]  we're facing straight ahead because there's a larger globalist operation
[04:53.080 --> 04:57.040]  behind this to bring down the United States and Russia when the globalists
[04:57.040 --> 05:01.800]  are done just when you think the government couldn't get any more
[05:01.800 --> 05:06.200]  ludicrous the US Environmental Protection Agency has taken to social
[05:06.200 --> 05:11.720]  media to point out the harmful effects of sunny days on plant life that's right
[05:11.720 --> 05:16.680]  the agency tweeted think sunny days are good for plants not always sunlight
[05:16.680 --> 05:21.920]  causes ozone to form which harms foliage and weakens trees makes you wonder
[05:21.920 --> 05:26.120]  how did the planet survive for millennia before a big bloated government
[05:26.120 --> 05:30.000]  came along to protect it let's just point out the absurdity of the EPA
[05:30.000 --> 05:34.200]  highlighting the alleged danger of sunlight as the world is facing numerous
[05:34.200 --> 05:38.080]  legitimate environmental issues some of which have been caused by the agency
[05:38.080 --> 05:42.400]  itself let's not forget this is the same agency that polluted the Animas River
[05:42.400 --> 05:47.040]  with more than three million gallons of toxic waste last month in an effort to
[05:47.040 --> 05:51.400]  cover up that disaster EPA officials refused to provide data to the press on
[05:51.400 --> 05:56.240]  the extent of the damage read the article Obama's EPA warns sunlight

[08:16.440 --> 08:24.320]  GCN radio network
[08:24.320 --> 08:31.360]  well it was a former Brigadier General Robert H. Scales the Fox News military
[08:31.360 --> 08:36.520]  analyst that called for quote it's time to start killing Russians to save Ukraine
[08:36.520 --> 08:42.120]  and fill up a lot of body bags and he's the same Pentagon general that's been
[08:42.120 --> 08:46.840]  proposing a limited nuclear war and and a lot of the other people depending on
[08:46.840 --> 08:50.640]  think we can have a nuclear war with Russia but that might not be a bad idea
[08:50.640 --> 08:56.840]  that's a Fox News I mentioned that because we have of course this new clip
[08:56.840 --> 09:03.560]  of John McCain he says arm Syrian rebels to shoot down Russian planes yeah
[09:03.560 --> 09:06.880]  you've already given them anti-tank missiles you've already given them some
[09:06.880 --> 09:12.680]  surface to aircraft missiles you've already turned al-Nusra that is al-Qaeda
[09:12.680 --> 09:17.680]  that is al-Qaeda you've already turned them loose to run around for five years
[09:17.680 --> 09:22.240]  murdering hundreds of thousands and so now you have the junior league to recruit
[09:22.240 --> 09:27.080]  young people around the world called ISIS and I'm gonna break down exactly who
[09:27.080 --> 09:31.960]  runs who in just a moment and why the Russians just blew up the al-Nusra
[09:31.960 --> 09:37.920]  command base because that's the quote moderate rebels and that's who NATO and
[09:37.920 --> 09:42.760]  the Pentagon have people in there advising I'll bet you my bottom dollar
[09:42.760 --> 09:48.720]  Western advisors were killed in these Russian strikes because the White House
[09:48.720 --> 09:54.640]  NATO France especially and then Saudi Arabia number one and Turkey are
[09:54.640 --> 10:00.320]  quarterbacking the entire attack that's why the foreign ministry yesterday you
[10:00.320 --> 10:05.520]  can pull this up went public warning the Russians that they would quote
[10:05.520 --> 10:12.640]  escalate military action if the Russians didn't pull out and Saudi Arabia in
[10:12.640 --> 10:20.680]  playing games they funded and they ran with Osama bin Laden as their top
[10:20.680 --> 10:26.120]  officer the clandestine attack with General Hamed Ghul who's been on this
[10:26.120 --> 10:32.240]  show doesn't go on any other Western shows to defeat the Russians in the
[10:32.240 --> 10:39.080]  Afghan war in the 1980s and the Saudi Arabians that have the largest military
[10:39.080 --> 10:43.440]  arsenal in the Middle East bigger than Israel's conventionally they have
[10:43.440 --> 10:50.000]  threatened to all-out attack Russia now this has escalated to insane asylum
[10:50.000 --> 10:57.560]  levels and so the Russians response this morning was to launch eight air
[10:57.560 --> 11:04.640]  strikes on the al-Nusra command bases and totally destroying it al-Qaeda gives
[11:04.640 --> 11:08.800]  the orders al-Nusra is al-Qaeda that's on record I'm gonna read mainstream news
[11:08.800 --> 11:13.160]  saying that they're like why are the Russians blowing up al-Qaeda while our
[11:13.160 --> 11:18.400]  media says they don't have any power anymore al-Qaeda became IS they fly the
[11:18.400 --> 11:23.600]  same flags they're the same people they are the Western intelligence Intel base
[11:23.600 --> 11:28.560]  so the Russians are trying to decapitate the command and control of ISIS in
[11:28.560 --> 11:33.800]  Syria that's what you do if you're actually trying to defeat an enemy is
[11:33.800 --> 11:38.200]  you kill their leadership you kill their military brass you kill their
[11:38.200 --> 11:47.240]  commanders in the field and you've got tens of thousands of Chinese pouring in
[11:47.240 --> 11:56.560]  ships are landing every day now tanks anti-aircraft weapons it's anti-tank
[11:56.560 --> 12:02.320]  weapons it's all pouring in Iranian troops are pouring in Hezbollah is
[12:02.320 --> 12:06.400]  pouring in on a Lebanon I mean this is biblical ladies and gentlemen
[12:06.400 --> 12:13.520]  Vladimir Putin just conscripted 150,000 troops today to defend the Russian
[12:13.520 --> 12:18.000]  borders against Islamic attack because the globalists are activating terror
[12:18.000 --> 12:21.520]  squads in Chechnya and many other areas right now
[12:21.520 --> 12:25.880]  preparing to do in the past blowing up train stations blowing up military
[12:25.880 --> 12:32.080]  bases attacking police stations I mean the New World Order runs al-Qaeda Saudi
[12:32.080 --> 12:36.680]  Arabia is in the middle of it they've been promised the entire Middle East it
[12:36.680 --> 12:41.880]  is unprecedented headline London Telegraph Russia kills US back Syrian
[12:41.880 --> 12:47.120]  rebels in second day of airstrikes as Iran prepares a ground offensive live
[12:47.120 --> 12:54.800]  updates and we'll roll some more of that bomb pod footage for folks here in just
[12:54.800 --> 12:58.600]  a moment we are some casting television right now and Russia doesn't have a
[12:58.600 --> 13:03.480]  choice is Russia perfect no but did Russia start this war did Russia start
[13:03.480 --> 13:06.840]  the Ukraine war did Russia start the Syria war did Russia start the Libya
[13:06.840 --> 13:13.960]  war did Russia start Iraq war did Russia fund al-Qaeda you understand that the
[13:13.960 --> 13:19.240]  two Boston bombing brothers on record had their cover blown by the Russians
[13:19.240 --> 13:22.840]  two years before the Boston bombing as CIA double agents flying under fake
[13:22.840 --> 13:27.880]  passports under the State Department you understand they're they're they're out
[13:27.880 --> 13:33.640]  of Georgetown University you understand they were going to Chechnya I don't know
[13:33.640 --> 13:41.240]  what happened with the Boston bombing I just know figure that one out that's why
[13:41.240 --> 13:44.440]  the FBI got caught lying saying we've never heard of these guys before I
[13:44.440 --> 13:49.360]  mean this is an insane time to be alive when the supposed people that carried
[13:49.360 --> 13:55.840]  out 9-11 the Saudi Arabian government has threatened Russia publicly to launch
[13:55.840 --> 14:00.480]  terror attacks inside Russia if they don't back out of the Middle East and
[14:00.480 --> 14:05.000]  then meanwhile Russia did kind of pull out of the Middle East a few years ago
[14:05.000 --> 14:09.120]  and then the West responses to start overthrowing areas of Ukraine on their
[14:09.120 --> 14:12.720]  border traditionally part of Russia and to start trying to overthrow Russia
[14:12.720 --> 14:18.160]  itself of color revolutions and Russia said okay we have no choice circle the
[14:18.160 --> 14:22.600]  wagons get ready for war just like with Napoleon just like with Hitler history
[14:22.600 --> 14:27.480]  now repeats itself yet again but this isn't communist Russia now hamstrung and
[14:27.480 --> 14:33.440]  totally controlled by Western back rebels that took over Russia in 1917 you
[14:33.440 --> 14:45.880]  know our government with the British put the horrible scum in in 1917 that was
[14:45.880 --> 14:50.080]  all basically New York London run but before I digress this is just an
[14:50.080 --> 14:56.360]  incredible time to be alive right now Russia moves to war footing boot and
[14:56.360 --> 15:00.040]  signs decree drafting a hundred thousand conscripts into the military as his
[15:00.040 --> 15:07.840]  jets launched a new wave of airstrikes here are some of the other headlines up
[15:07.840 --> 15:14.520]  on info wars.com Iran Hezbollah Syrian army prepared to launch offensive against
[15:14.520 --> 15:21.680]  CIA proxies on the ground and the air offensive has already been launched they
[15:21.680 --> 15:26.720]  run the headline that the USA is in disarray Iran troops ready well there's
[15:26.720 --> 15:32.240]  no disarray about it they bet on the Sunni majority that's 79% of Muslims
[15:32.240 --> 15:36.480]  that Saudi Arabia is basically dominating and controlling and bullying
[15:36.480 --> 15:41.000]  with Wahhabist ideology I'm not saying Sunnis are bad people or Shiites are bad
[15:41.000 --> 15:47.640]  people they kill each other constantly for over a thousand years the problem
[15:47.640 --> 15:59.600]  here and the ongoing crisis here is that this is no longer just a proxy war this
[15:59.600 --> 16:05.040]  is becoming a major war with the Chinese the Russians the Iranians the
[16:05.040 --> 16:16.360]  Syrians lined up against NATO Europe the United States Turkey Saudi Arabia
[16:16.360 --> 16:21.400]  Israel is backing the Syrian rebels Israel came out Netanyahu yesterday and
[16:21.400 --> 16:26.480]  said they're going to begin airstrikes in areas of Syria against the Assad
[16:26.480 --> 16:33.280]  forces Israel is announcing that they will fly into airspace with Russian
[16:33.280 --> 16:38.080]  aircraft and will start targeting the Assad forces who for five years have
[16:38.080 --> 16:41.920]  been toe-to-toe against the Saudi Arabian Turkish proxy army funded with
[16:41.920 --> 16:45.760]  US weapons and they killed the people at Benghazi to give them the weapons you
[16:45.760 --> 16:49.560]  talk about dirty and evil and a lot of folks don't know what to do been pro
[16:49.560 --> 16:55.680]  Israel because I'm not anti-Israel but Israel you can say either is involved or
[16:55.680 --> 16:59.800]  quarterbacking it or is that following orders I don't know I know this they're
[16:59.800 --> 17:03.640]  involved in it following Russian airstrikes Israeli defense minister
[17:03.640 --> 17:08.240]  says Israel will defend its interest in Syria and then again they go on to
[17:08.240 --> 17:12.960]  announce are gonna start airstrikes against Assad forces Assad's done
[17:12.960 --> 17:16.880]  nothing under international law their government was democratizing they were
[17:16.880 --> 17:22.040]  infiltrated they were attacked by Al Qaeda forces that is who Al Nuzra is and
[17:22.040 --> 17:26.280]  I'm gonna skip this network break this is so important but only this one today
[17:26.280 --> 17:31.360]  here is the news from Reuters now they spin this but in the article is the
[17:31.360 --> 17:37.600]  truth Russian warplanes this is the key Russian warplanes target insurgents in
[17:37.600 --> 17:42.640]  Syria but not Islamic State well they're not gonna target a bunch of grunts from
[17:42.640 --> 17:48.880]  Saudi Arabia Qatar the United States Australia Germany France the you you
[17:48.880 --> 17:54.880]  know the UK they're not gonna target the grunts on the ground first they're
[17:54.880 --> 18:00.880]  going to target who runs them the pro-demasters television channel said
[18:00.880 --> 18:04.800]  jets carried out at least 30 strikes they hit eight different areas but 30
[18:04.800 --> 18:10.040]  strikes in one spot as insurgent alliance known as the army of conquest the
[18:10.040 --> 18:15.800]  alliance includes the Nuzra front an Al Qaeda Syrian branch but not Islamic
[18:15.800 --> 18:22.280]  State which has declared a caliphate on swaths of Syria and Iraq I asked is the
[18:22.280 --> 18:26.200]  payoff to Saudi Arabia for the new Islamic State to launch new attacks
[18:26.200 --> 18:31.880]  worldwide in between Iraq and Syria so that's the new breakup of Syria and Iraq
[18:31.880 --> 18:35.400]  and then they just put a bunch of young dumb idiots in there will be removed
[18:35.400 --> 18:39.800]  later with whatever the West puts in and whatever Saudi Arabia puts in so that's
[18:39.800 --> 18:45.160]  just the proxy army of wannabe cowboy playboy you know rape king scum filth
[18:45.160 --> 18:50.600]  trash that the West has produced and Saudi Arabia has produced the real
[18:50.600 --> 18:56.320]  rebels trying to overthrow Assad our Al Qaeda that's that's Reuters and the
[18:56.320 --> 19:03.480]  Russians just blew them up now Russia's bombing who supposedly blew up our
[19:03.480 --> 19:07.520]  towers on 9-11 and killed all of our Americans and we had to give up all our
[19:07.520 --> 19:12.080]  rights because of it and Russia is being attacked all over its southern belly
[19:12.080 --> 19:17.120]  by these very same people that are US government trained on record our own
[19:17.120 --> 19:20.120]  military knows this and is speaking out and saying no the former head of the
[19:20.120 --> 19:23.000]  defense intelligence went public two months ago as you know we played the
[19:23.000 --> 19:29.520]  clip probably 15 times and the response of John McCain we're gonna play it right
[19:29.520 --> 19:37.800]  now the response of John McCain is let's give him service to air missiles
[19:37.800 --> 19:40.680]  which he knows they've already got they've already shot down a bunch of
[19:40.680 --> 19:46.440]  Syrian aircraft the Russians just have better systems to avoid them different
[19:46.440 --> 19:50.280]  countermeasures and have better training and so I still think you'll
[19:50.280 --> 19:53.280]  probably see Russian aircraft shot down because they're going up against the
[19:53.280 --> 19:58.920]  best weapons Saudi Arabia Europe and the United States taxpayers have to offer
[19:58.920 --> 20:03.600]  the center but if they are attacking the very guys who we want to see topple
[20:03.600 --> 20:09.920]  aside you you would let American planes just to pass them and let them do that
[20:09.920 --> 20:14.320]  no but I might do what we did in Afghanistan many years ago to give those
[20:14.320 --> 20:19.560]  guys the ability to shoot down those planes that that equipment is available
[20:19.560 --> 20:24.320]  who would be shooting them down the Free Syrian Army free free like the
[20:24.320 --> 20:29.080]  Afghan shot down the Russian no just like the Russian the Afghan shot down Russian
[20:29.080 --> 20:33.320]  planes I hear you invaded but you know what I'm saying I mean I want to start
[20:33.320 --> 20:40.880]  at the beginning because it's important let's let's play this clip without me
[20:40.880 --> 20:45.120]  interrupting and here it is but if they are attacking the very guys who we want
[20:45.120 --> 20:51.800]  to see topple aside you you would let American planes just to pass them and
[20:51.800 --> 20:56.360]  let them do that no but I might do what we did in Afghanistan many years ago to
[20:56.360 --> 21:01.080]  give those guys the ability to shoot down those planes that that equipment is
[21:01.080 --> 21:06.720]  available who would be shooting him down the Free Syrian Army just like the
[21:06.720 --> 21:11.080]  Afghan shot down the Russian no just like the Russian the Afghan shot down
[21:11.080 --> 21:14.720]  Russian planes I hear you invaded Afghanistan but you know what I'm saying
[21:14.720 --> 21:18.480]  I mean you could see how easily as you pointed out to me in prior visits how
[21:18.480 --> 21:22.880]  easily something like this escalates into something much much worse are we at
[21:22.880 --> 21:27.920]  that stage I think would be much much worse but this this administration this
[21:27.920 --> 21:30.600]  president this secretary of state they aren't going to do anything that would
[21:30.600 --> 21:33.960]  escalate it they're going to give them a free hand just like they have given them
[21:33.960 --> 21:38.640]  a free hand throughout just like we have no that's not true whatsoever so while
[21:38.640 --> 21:43.200]  we watch innocent men women and children we have no strategy the neocons
[21:43.200 --> 21:49.000]  basically run Obama they're doing exactly what McCain wanted to do but
[21:49.000 --> 21:54.360]  he's giving Obama right cover from the fake right attacking him saying he has
[21:54.360 --> 22:00.280]  no strategy no strategy they have brought the weapons of Israel Saudi Arabia
[22:00.280 --> 22:06.840]  Turkey the EU and its NATO army the UN army that's what NATO is and the United
[22:06.840 --> 22:12.720]  States military weapons supplies for five years bullying the daylights out of
[22:12.720 --> 22:19.760]  the Syrians and killing over 300,000 of them almost all of them civilians
[22:19.760 --> 22:27.280]  Christians Protestant and Catholic non-radical Alawite peaceful Muslims and
[22:27.280 --> 22:31.080]  others and that's why they're getting rid of one of the oldest Jewish
[22:31.080 --> 22:34.280]  communities one of the oldest Christian communities and one of the oldest
[22:34.280 --> 22:38.760]  Muslim communities in the world is Syria where people have lived in peace for
[22:38.760 --> 22:45.480]  thousands of years because it's a tolerant government they're leaders
[22:45.480 --> 22:50.080]  wear suits and ties folks and that's why they're being removed from power women
[22:50.080 --> 22:53.440]  don't wear hoods over their heads
[22:54.320 --> 22:58.840]  women are free over there just like they were in Iraq are they free now in Iraq
[22:58.840 --> 23:05.760]  no they're not the West wants Stone Age barbarism over there the globalist want
[23:05.760 --> 23:12.040]  agenda 21 deindustrialization worldwide they do their own soft kill policies
[23:12.040 --> 23:16.440]  here to shut off our industries break down our families poison us and then
[23:16.440 --> 23:20.240]  when they're able to really have their way with the country they'll dismantle
[23:20.240 --> 23:25.920]  and blow up the entire infrastructure like Libya we told you they deindustrialize
[23:25.920 --> 23:30.080]  and bring that country to the ground and raise every piece of equipment they
[23:30.080 --> 23:35.640]  had in a scorched earth policy and they did exactly that because we know their
[23:35.640 --> 23:39.240]  operations and I want to explain something the Soviet Union I've studied
[23:39.240 --> 23:44.400]  it was incredibly oppressive total political correctness an absolute
[23:44.400 --> 23:48.480]  nightmare that Alexander Sholzenitsyn exposed but by the time he left the US
[23:48.480 --> 23:52.200]  in the early 90s and went back to Russia the Pulitzer Prize winner he said
[23:52.200 --> 23:55.880]  America is going to become even more evil and Russia's got to get
[23:55.880 --> 24:00.080]  nationalistic right now because the plan is to basically bring in corporate
[24:00.080 --> 24:04.080]  communism worldwide where they're exempt go read the last four or five books
[24:04.080 --> 24:09.320]  Sholzenitsyn wrote sounds like I wrote them and when I was sitting there
[24:09.320 --> 24:14.000]  reading those books it wasn't like I wrote them we just both know knew the
[24:14.000 --> 24:17.400]  truth the truth is the truth even if never heard somebody else say it you
[24:17.400 --> 24:25.360]  already know it if you studied it and so as bad as the Soviet Union was there
[24:25.360 --> 24:29.680]  were attacks launched in Russia by forces out of Afghanistan this is all
[24:29.680 --> 24:34.520]  declassified by Zbigniew Brzezinski in 1979 Reagan didn't watch that Reagan
[24:34.520 --> 24:38.320]  didn't run that he just got the credit for it and I'm not defending or attacking
[24:38.320 --> 24:43.280]  Reagan Reagan didn't run the Afghan operations Reagan didn't start it
[24:43.280 --> 24:49.000]  Zbigniew Brzezinski did it's declassified they attacked the Russians in 78 and 79
[24:49.000 --> 24:53.120]  with hundreds of attacks and then the Russians came in at the behest of the
[24:53.120 --> 24:57.480]  Afghan government and they called it an invasion to take out the terrorist that
[24:57.480 --> 25:02.560]  were attacking Russia and to get control of the opium because the Soviets were
[25:02.560 --> 25:06.920]  running smack into the US the CIA didn't like it they wanted the profits so just
[25:06.920 --> 25:13.640]  two different criminal predator grips and we'll get Joe Scowze's perspective on
[25:13.640 --> 25:18.240]  all this coming up he made differ a bit but this is historically what we know
[25:18.240 --> 25:23.600]  went on and that was an evil war that was wrong and then look what we got out
[25:23.600 --> 25:29.400]  of it 9-11 and now though talk about hindsight being 2020 the children of
[25:29.400 --> 25:34.960]  al-Qaida some of them the original leaders of al-Qaida from Afghanistan the
[25:34.960 --> 25:45.080]  Saudi Arabian command group that ran that war in Afghanistan and in Pakistan
[25:46.600 --> 25:52.040]  because believe me there was a proxy war there as well not just Afghanistan we are
[25:52.040 --> 26:03.400]  now watching our government nakedly sit there and endorse airstrikes against the
[26:03.400 --> 26:08.200]  military of Syria that's now been given Russian air cover so we're gonna have
[26:08.200 --> 26:17.520]  US NATO it's all moving into place Israeli forces on the ground who are
[26:17.520 --> 26:29.200]  already there and then in the air this confrontation is accelerating extremely
[26:29.200 --> 26:33.720]  quickly and is incredibly destabilizing the whole world and is incredibly
[26:33.720 --> 26:44.880]  immoral that John McCain would meet with al-Nazra that he calls the free Syrian
[26:44.880 --> 26:49.440]  army that he would give them the weapons there's photographs of him with the
[26:49.440 --> 26:55.560]  leaders of al-Nazra and the leader that became the number two over ISIS this is
[26:55.560 --> 27:02.200]  incredible and so you've got all these different factions run by Saudi Arabia
[27:02.200 --> 27:07.640]  IS Islamic State is creating a breakup of Syria and Iraq and out of the breakup
[27:07.640 --> 27:13.840]  creating a new country between the two but separately you've got al-Nazra that
[27:13.840 --> 27:20.840]  will be the group with the committee of conquest that is to take over the central
[27:20.840 --> 27:26.600]  government of what's left of Syria and the coastline and the oil and the gas so
[27:26.600 --> 27:32.440]  there it all is explained in living color if your former military current
[27:32.440 --> 27:36.640]  military former State Department or if you're in the Middle East if you've got
[27:36.640 --> 27:40.360]  some gravitas to add to this if you disagree with me on some point if you
[27:40.360 --> 27:48.360]  agree if you'd like to augment what I've said concerning how dangerous this is or
[27:48.360 --> 27:52.040]  perhaps you don't think it's a problem we don't screen your calls we love to
[27:52.040 --> 28:03.880]  hear what you have to say 800 259 9231 800 259 9231 now this next clip is from a
[28:03.880 --> 28:12.280]  year ago Putin at a world conference and this is where Putin is talking about
[28:12.280 --> 28:20.280]  how our government the US government created Islamic State and more and more
[28:20.280 --> 28:24.080]  we're going to be going through with actual Russian speakers and listening
[28:24.080 --> 28:28.040]  to what Putin says and creating our own translations because the ones you're
[28:28.040 --> 28:32.080]  seeing on our news are not what Putin is saying Putin is coming right out of the
[28:32.080 --> 28:36.840]  UN Monday and right out of the other events in the last few years saying
[28:36.840 --> 28:40.600]  it's a proxy war to destabilize things that our government's putting al-Qaeda
[28:40.600 --> 28:43.800]  in charge take over that area of the world and then to threaten Russia and
[28:43.800 --> 28:48.320]  you'll never hear it on the news and then the media spends it like Putin is
[28:48.320 --> 28:52.480]  embarrassing America and Putin is our enemy and all the rest of it the truth
[28:52.480 --> 28:56.960]  is even if Putin was a horrible guy he's not on the offense our government's
[28:56.960 --> 29:00.840]  starting the fight and putting people who are horrible in charge so we're
[29:00.840 --> 29:07.120]  losing the moral high ground because of it here is put another threat that
[29:07.120 --> 29:16.440]  president Obama mentioned was ISIS well who on earth armed them who helped to
[29:16.440 --> 29:23.520]  arm the Syrians that were fighting against Assad who created the necessary
[29:23.520 --> 29:28.720]  political climate that facilitated the situation who pushed for the delivery of
[29:28.720 --> 29:33.880]  arms to the area you really not understand as to who is fighting in
[29:33.880 --> 29:39.240]  Syria all right we'll be back we're gonna be taking your calls on this
[29:39.240 --> 29:43.600]  incredibly important subject that we are now not just in a proxy war with Russia
[29:43.600 --> 29:50.360]  and China and Iran we're now in a war with them we're on the March the
[29:50.360 --> 30:01.000]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network have you waited your
[30:01.000 --> 30:05.960]  whole life to become a mother well you're probably a racist sexist homophobe
[30:05.960 --> 30:10.880]  LGBT activists have already convinced the midwives Alliance of North America to
[30:10.880 --> 30:15.440]  stop referring to their clients as women and mothers and instead call them
[30:15.440 --> 30:20.360]  pregnant people and birthing individuals so transsexuals won't get offended
[30:20.360 --> 30:25.160]  numerous midwives have protested this language change calling it an attack on
[30:25.160 --> 30:29.840]  women in an open letter they say by embracing the idea that any human other
[30:29.840 --> 30:34.440]  than those in a class called women can carry offspring to term give birth to
[30:34.440 --> 30:40.400]  them and nurse them we are prioritizing gender identity over biological reality
[30:40.400 --> 30:45.200]  obviously this ideology contributes to the cultural erasure of women's unique
[30:45.200 --> 30:50.200]  power to give birth it is encoded in our female bodies that's what creates

[33:07.760 --> 33:23.800]  you want answers? Well so does he. It's Alex Jones. I want to move quick through the news now I basically
[33:23.800 --> 33:29.680]  bemoan the fact that as a culture as a country we really do have madmen running
[33:29.680 --> 33:35.720]  things who are trying to start a war with China and Russia and they know that
[33:35.720 --> 33:39.920]  the people during a crisis like this will go into primitive mode and will
[33:39.920 --> 33:44.360]  start defending whatever the government does once a wider war starts my
[33:44.360 --> 33:50.120]  country right or wrong. The problem is America has officially according to the
[33:50.120 --> 33:55.000]  Davos Switzerland meetings and other globalist announcements been quote
[33:55.000 --> 34:01.240]  integrated into the New World Order private corporate global government. Now
[34:01.240 --> 34:07.840]  integrated into that means conquered means taken over means assimilated and so
[34:07.840 --> 34:11.200]  for all intents and purposes they have conquered the United States of America
[34:11.200 --> 34:15.820]  through subterfuge and infiltration and these corporate interests are not going
[34:15.820 --> 34:18.960]  to be fighting and dying they're not going to be paying for the war you and
[34:18.960 --> 34:24.400]  I are and they intend to either financially break Russia or have enough
[34:24.400 --> 34:28.640]  proxy wars with Russia that Russia finally makes a miscalculation and they
[34:28.640 --> 34:34.960]  can sell a wider war. That's what the whole COG and Homeland Security and all
[34:34.960 --> 34:40.320]  of it is about hardening the government to survive a nuclear war. This is the
[34:40.320 --> 34:45.640]  madness that we had several times under L. L. Limnitzer and other chairman of the
[34:45.640 --> 34:50.640]  Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Cold War. John F. Kennedy shut down those plans
[34:50.640 --> 34:56.560]  not once but twice himself Eisenhower shut down a plan at least twice to launch
[34:56.560 --> 35:04.280]  preemptive nuclear war against Russia and China and so we have a global elite
[35:04.280 --> 35:07.440]  who want to bring down the nation-states and bring in a one-world
[35:07.440 --> 35:12.680]  government but they need a global crisis to sell it so America and Russia is
[35:12.680 --> 35:17.080]  under globalist attack just like Syria is under globalist attack we all have
[35:17.080 --> 35:22.080]  solidarity in that we're under the technocratic manipulation the divide and
[35:22.080 --> 35:25.720]  conquer the grand chessboard that Brzezinski wrote about in his book a
[35:25.720 --> 35:31.240]  decade ago admitting all of this and that out of destabilizing Russia and
[35:31.240 --> 35:36.040]  funding radical Islamic jihadists to destabilize them at least they could
[35:36.040 --> 35:41.080]  bring in a global crisis to establish the collapse of the nation-state and the
[35:41.080 --> 35:44.920]  rise of world government. Go read his book I've read the quotes here on air
[35:44.920 --> 35:50.160]  probably a hundred times he thinks you're so stupid he writes policy books
[35:50.160 --> 35:54.440]  admitting all of this he wrote a book admitting he helped set up the Kermit
[35:54.440 --> 36:06.720]  Rouge that killed 35% of Cambodia for no reason whole families so we're not we're
[36:06.720 --> 36:11.400]  not messing with people who aren't dangerous the globalists are smart they
[36:11.400 --> 36:17.000]  have a lot of super secret weapons they have a lot of super weapons they have
[36:17.000 --> 36:21.080]  infiltrators all over the place they have the the dollar still so they can
[36:21.080 --> 36:24.320]  buy off anybody they want as the world reserve currency this is a very very
[36:24.320 --> 36:29.720]  dangerous time to be alive the people running our government are so wicked and
[36:29.720 --> 36:37.760]  so Machiavellian and so evil they would fund actual al-Qaeda to go into five
[36:37.760 --> 36:43.000]  different countries and murder every Christian they get their hands on men
[36:43.000 --> 36:47.320]  women and children raping them chopping their heads off forcing fathers of
[36:47.320 --> 36:51.240]  suicide bomber they kill their whole family in front of them I mean the scum
[36:51.240 --> 36:58.440]  of the earth and our government the people that run our government are such
[36:58.440 --> 37:04.400]  villains that bipartisan they've done this and it was so over the top our own
[37:04.400 --> 37:10.160]  military two three years ago said no to being the Air Force for al-Qaeda no to
[37:10.160 --> 37:18.040]  toppling Assad and so they had to go to an or more of a covert approach and they
[37:18.040 --> 37:25.640]  resupplied the al-Qaeda forces and IS in Iraq with huge US weapons caches that
[37:25.640 --> 37:32.920]  were recently created and deployed and contractors are told you go out to this
[37:32.920 --> 37:37.160]  old base that's shut down it's got five Iraqis guarding it you put 300 Toyota
[37:37.160 --> 37:41.440]  trucks with heavy 50 cows there and you leave the keys inside the storage
[37:41.440 --> 37:46.480]  facility then the Iraqi troops are sitting out there in the middle of
[37:46.480 --> 37:51.080]  nowhere they've been paid off they disappear in drives the convoy carrying
[37:51.080 --> 37:57.240]  men in the back of each truck to be resupplied right there at the base C 130
[37:57.240 --> 38:07.520]  lands offloads more weapons this is an absolutely mega evil operation and it's
[38:07.520 --> 38:13.080]  so brazen it's so naked it's so evil keep using the word evil because that's
[38:13.080 --> 38:20.240]  what it is it's so wicked that they think they'll actually get away with it and
[38:20.240 --> 38:25.520]  I'm telling you there's another wrinkle to this baby this is all meant to come
[38:25.520 --> 38:28.880]  out and further demonize America worldwide because all over the world
[38:28.880 --> 38:34.480]  people know our government is running this whole show all over the world people
[38:34.480 --> 38:39.320]  know that America is no longer the good guys and they're saying Putin's the
[38:39.320 --> 38:43.600]  leader of the free world and that Putin's a hero and Americans all over the
[38:43.600 --> 38:49.560]  place left and right love Putin Putin's a billionaire oligarch with all sorts of
[38:49.560 --> 38:53.240]  shady connections and a strong man the difference is though he doesn't put
[38:53.240 --> 38:56.520]  fluoride in the people's water and he does have a breeding program so Russians
[38:56.520 --> 39:00.280]  don't go extinct and he is trying to build up their civilization but
[39:00.280 --> 39:04.720]  nevertheless he is a strong man I wouldn't call him the the the paragon of
[39:04.720 --> 39:12.760]  perfect you know behavior but compared to the absolute abject filth that is
[39:12.760 --> 39:22.120]  hijacked our culture in society he is good he is a lesser of two evils because
[39:22.120 --> 39:27.240]  Russia has been attacked not the United States and the very people that
[39:27.240 --> 39:32.680]  supposedly attacked us 14 years ago are now attacking Russian interest and Russia
[39:32.680 --> 39:36.840]  dares to raise a hand against them and all these bullies in the United States
[39:36.840 --> 39:41.000]  and all these bullies in Israel and all these bullies in Turkey and all these
[39:41.000 --> 39:46.000]  bullies in Saudi Arabia say how dare you we're gonna send in more weapons we're
[39:46.000 --> 39:50.360]  gonna kill Russians we're gonna take you out we're gonna fill body bags with you
[39:50.360 --> 39:55.600]  how dare you but I want to be clear the average Turkish person the average
[39:55.600 --> 39:59.480]  Israeli the average Saudi Arabian the average American the average French
[39:59.480 --> 40:04.640]  person does not back Al Qaeda or Al Nazra does not like ISIS and doesn't
[40:04.640 --> 40:08.600]  like what's happening and once our governments to take these people out so
[40:08.600 --> 40:12.160]  they did fake airstrikes on them that's been proven the Iraqi government's gone
[40:12.160 --> 40:23.320]  public so when I say shame on Israel shame on the US I mean shame on the
[40:23.320 --> 40:28.800]  power mad demons bipartisanly in all of these major countries that are going
[40:28.800 --> 40:40.080]  with this globalist plan it is the most nakedly evil America has ever been on
[40:40.080 --> 40:51.240]  the world stage it is just total corruption total mind-blowing twisted
[40:51.240 --> 40:59.240]  manipulation in front of the world Russian airstrikes in Syria continue
[40:59.240 --> 41:06.320]  Putin drafts 150,000 US is in quote disarray Iran troops are ready info wars
[41:06.320 --> 41:12.640]  calm Iran Hezbollah Syrian army prepared to launch larger offensive against CIA
[41:12.640 --> 41:17.480]  proxies all out war Iranian troops to conduct ground attacks in Syria
[41:17.480 --> 41:21.920]  meanwhile back in America Planned Parenthood had questions about sale of
[41:21.920 --> 41:28.480]  aborted babies are sexist and it gets better Twitter characterizes
[41:28.480 --> 41:32.600]  disagreeing that's an actual quote with someone's opinion as abusive behavior
[41:32.600 --> 41:40.680]  and will ban you if you're criticizing quote liberalism can't make that up I
[41:40.680 --> 41:44.520]  mean meanwhile they're teaching five-year-olds how to go to tranny
[41:44.520 --> 41:48.640]  bathrooms meanwhile we're drinking fluoride meanwhile meanwhile we're
[41:48.640 --> 41:52.720]  being lecture on what words we can use by a bunch of totalitarians masquerading
[41:52.720 --> 42:00.720]  as liberals what a joke I want to go to a boom Charlene Garrett Robert Chris and
[42:00.720 --> 42:08.120]  others we hired a lady a few months ago and as we ease in our crew we'll give
[42:08.120 --> 42:10.640]  you their full names everything so they can be put to the crucible and attacked
[42:10.640 --> 42:14.600]  in the media but Daria as a native Russian speaker she's a graduate of the
[42:14.600 --> 42:17.960]  Defense Language School at Monterey California that's where two of the
[42:17.960 --> 42:21.640]  hijackers at least got trained the Dean of the Defense Language School went
[42:21.640 --> 42:26.520]  public about that and got shut down that's a side issue she's been watching
[42:26.520 --> 42:30.560]  these Putin speeches and has shown us the Russian transcripts versus the US
[42:30.560 --> 42:34.400]  transcripts and it's night and day different so she went in and did a
[42:34.400 --> 42:40.280]  transcript of the Putin UN speech at least five minutes of it from Tuesday
[42:40.280 --> 42:45.880]  September 29th just to show how incredibly different what you heard in the UN
[42:45.880 --> 42:54.120]  translation in the United States was versus what really happened Putin's
[42:54.120 --> 42:58.040]  message lost in translation Russian president speech calls out key aspects
[42:58.040 --> 43:01.920]  the New World Order agenda that's a very important article but it needs to get
[43:01.920 --> 43:07.400]  more attention so I want it republished under the headline media caught
[43:07.400 --> 43:16.720]  distorting Putin's speech media caught distorting Putin's UN speech
[43:16.720 --> 43:22.240]  president Vladimir Putin called out the West complicity in terrorism in real
[43:22.240 --> 43:27.440]  speech something like that because it's a very important article after Joe
[43:27.440 --> 43:30.680]  Biggs joins us with Jacarie Jackson from the anti-gunner rally that's
[43:30.680 --> 43:36.320]  happening at UT details are at info wars.com and a red-linked article we
[43:36.320 --> 43:39.880]  will get into that and play her report then but first before I go to your phone
[43:39.880 --> 43:45.880]  calls here is a piece from the Washington Free Beacon a mashup of Obama first
[43:45.880 --> 43:49.880]  supporting the Syrian rebels then saying he didn't support the rebels here it is
[43:49.880 --> 43:54.960]  for many of you have understandably asked me questions about the claims of
[43:54.960 --> 43:59.360]  our critics who suggest that the administration should invest more
[43:59.360 --> 44:03.200]  deeply in training and equipping members of the Syrian opposition that
[44:03.200 --> 44:05.800]  that was the recipe for success that is not something that this
[44:05.800 --> 44:09.240]  administration ever believed but it is something that our critics will have to
[44:09.240 --> 44:16.560]  enter for. President for some time has been concerned that the the lawlessness
[44:16.560 --> 44:21.120]  and violence that we've seen in Syria does have a destabilizing dangerous
[44:21.120 --> 44:25.760]  impact a way to address that in our view is to bolster the moderate opposition
[44:25.760 --> 44:30.640]  provide them additional assistance. We have a free Syrian army and a moderate
[44:30.640 --> 44:34.880]  opposition that we have steadily been working with that we have vetted at the
[44:34.880 --> 44:38.840]  West Point speech that I gave I said we need to put more resources into the
[44:38.840 --> 44:44.040]  moderate opposition. President does believe that that there would be value
[44:44.040 --> 44:47.880]  to ramp up the assistance that we provide to members of the moderate Syrian
[44:47.880 --> 44:53.400]  opposition. Stepping up the efforts with respect to the moderate opposition is an
[44:53.400 --> 44:57.320]  essential piece of any strategy against ISIL. With this new effort we'll provide
[44:57.320 --> 45:02.000]  training and equipment to help them grow stronger.
[45:02.000 --> 45:06.000]  But I think it's also time for our critics to fess up in this regard as well.
[45:06.000 --> 45:10.960]  Oh it's time for us to fess up that we're wrong. Okay here's Reuters saying that
[45:10.960 --> 45:20.040]  Russia wants at least 30 airstrikes on one base alone the army of conquest group
[45:20.040 --> 45:27.600]  led by al-Nusra al-Qaeda Syrian branch. Well yes that's the command and control
[45:27.600 --> 45:32.520]  base where the West meets with the moderates which is al-Qaeda who actually
[45:32.520 --> 45:36.520]  are just the grandpas and daddies of Islamic State that flies the exact same
[45:36.520 --> 45:41.160]  flags the exact same people. They're just the average age of about 25 and are
[45:41.160 --> 45:44.840]  just the boots on the ground creating the new country because they're breaking
[45:44.840 --> 45:50.200]  up Syria and Iraq. Two different operations take part of Iraq take part of
[45:50.200 --> 45:55.160]  Syria let them create a new country pay off the Saudi Arabia have a new
[45:55.160 --> 45:58.520]  headquarters to launch terror attacks worldwide then Western governments can
[45:58.520 --> 46:05.920]  take more of our freedoms. Iran troops to join Syrian war Russia bombs group
[46:05.920 --> 46:12.720]  trained by CIA that's Reuters and again who does Reuters say the group is al-Qaeda
[46:12.720 --> 46:18.760]  that's how dumb they think you are you know Reuters article Russia's bombing
[46:18.760 --> 46:27.320]  al-Qaeda that leads the the good Syrian rebels. I mean do you understand how
[46:27.320 --> 46:32.080]  evil our government is folks let me explain something I don't want to sit
[46:32.080 --> 46:36.240]  here and say this this is a setup to bring our country down this is diabolical
[46:36.240 --> 46:40.160]  folks the whole world's turning against America right now and this was all done
[46:40.160 --> 46:45.040]  by designed by the American hating scum that set this up back in the 70s was a
[46:45.040 --> 46:51.360]  big New Brzezinski. This is a globalist master plan to turn jihad forces loose
[46:51.360 --> 46:56.240]  all over to take over cause a religious civil war between Shiites and Sunnis
[46:56.240 --> 47:00.880]  out of which is the class of civilizations that world government
[47:00.880 --> 47:06.320]  will rise with a one-world religion where you can't be a conservative
[47:06.320 --> 47:11.320]  Christian but you've got to moderate and submit and dress how Muslims want you
[47:11.320 --> 47:18.160]  to. You can now see at all the total radical plan to end the renaissance by
[47:18.160 --> 47:26.880]  driving a giant radical Islamic harpoon right through our heart. I've said it for
[47:26.880 --> 47:30.520]  over a decade al-Qaeda is the master skeleton key that opens every door for
[47:30.520 --> 47:34.600]  the new world order it is the Saudi Arabian Turkish intelligence operation
[47:34.600 --> 47:42.200]  it runs all the radical Muslim groups that are Sunni the Shiite groups again
[47:42.200 --> 47:46.560]  are Hezbollah they are mainly a military group and they've been sitting back on
[47:46.560 --> 47:51.200]  the shadows not launching terror attacks for a very very long time but yes if we
[47:51.200 --> 47:56.240]  have an all-out war with the Iranians they will activate sleeper cells all
[47:56.240 --> 48:00.760]  over the west and you won't have young 25 year old jihadis running around
[48:00.760 --> 48:04.480]  shooting up schools and stuff you will have attacks on government facilities
[48:04.480 --> 48:08.440]  which is what the new world order wants that'll destabilize the government
[48:08.440 --> 48:13.360]  further bringing in total globalist rule man you can see the master takeover
[48:13.360 --> 48:23.040]  plan it makes my head spin and now we're in toe-to-toe war with US forces and
[48:23.040 --> 48:27.720]  NATO forces fighting Russians with the Israelis announcing they're gonna be in
[48:27.720 --> 48:35.360]  airstrikes against Syrian Assad government forces who have been fighting a
[48:35.360 --> 48:42.880]  giant proxy army for five years valiantly I mean you can't but root for
[48:42.880 --> 48:47.960]  them they didn't start it they didn't do it they're moderate they're normal they're
[48:47.960 --> 48:52.800]  they they're not committing crimes they are fighting against the trash of the
[48:52.800 --> 48:58.480]  planet and it is just so over-the-top evil and then out of this is a general
[48:58.480 --> 49:02.600]  demonization of Muslims in the class of civilization which the globalists want
[49:02.600 --> 49:07.120]  to divide and conquer people as well and then Saudi Arabia is given total
[49:07.120 --> 49:11.640]  control over all of the Muslim world to basically kingpin that whole operation
[49:11.640 --> 49:15.920]  and again that's British intelligence all over again we're gonna go to break
[49:15.920 --> 49:20.040]  and come right back and go to Habu Charlene Garrett Robert Chris and others

[54:07.400 --> 54:13.920]  I don't want no shackles on me. That's crazy. We probably play this
[54:13.920 --> 54:18.320]  bumper music that Jimmy Vaughn recorded for the show a few years ago against
[54:18.320 --> 54:26.400]  RFID chips. I was just thinking about Jimmy Vaughn. I might think about
[54:26.400 --> 54:32.600]  once a week or something. I was just thinking about him. My kids play with
[54:32.600 --> 54:36.400]  his daughters right as I was coming out of break and then some of his music
[54:36.400 --> 54:39.240]  played, which we might play, I don't know, once a month or something. That's just
[54:39.240 --> 54:43.960]  crazy. Serendipity, synchronicity, what do you call it? And you know, I have
[54:43.960 --> 54:47.880]  children. A lot of you have children. I just want to have a civilization. I just
[54:47.880 --> 54:51.960]  want to live and let live. If a country messes with us, I want to stand up to
[54:51.960 --> 54:57.160]  them. But our country's been hijacked and taken control of. It's being used as an
[54:57.160 --> 55:05.320]  engine of evil worldwide. And now the Russians and others are massing forces to
[55:05.320 --> 55:11.320]  fight the Saudi Arabian proxy army. And Saudi Arabia is saying, fine, we're going
[55:11.320 --> 55:16.760]  to escalate. And this is how wars get really, really out of control very, very
[55:16.760 --> 55:25.240]  quickly. And Neil Cavuto says to, and I'm going to your calls. Neil Cavuto says
[55:25.240 --> 55:28.360]  that John McCain, well, isn't escalating this sending more troops and weapons
[55:28.360 --> 55:33.800]  going to escalate? And McCain goes, yes. If there's a problem, Obama isn't
[55:33.800 --> 55:40.680]  escalating. But Obama is escalating. Everything is just deceiving the public
[55:40.680 --> 55:48.200]  with a straight face. It's so sick. And to see them put America clearly in the
[55:48.200 --> 55:53.800]  position of being the bad guys. Because we've been above the law and arrogant
[55:53.800 --> 55:58.680]  for so long makes my head spin. Let's go to Habu and then other callers. Habu,
[55:58.680 --> 56:03.400]  you're on the air. Welcome. Yeah, good day to you. And thank you very much for
[56:03.400 --> 56:09.720]  the opportunity. What you've said so far is spot on from where I sit. But may I
[56:09.720 --> 56:17.000]  just offer a couple of brief comments? One is, now we can see in hindsight that
[56:17.000 --> 56:23.880]  the whole migrant refugee crisis was a spectacle that was staged so that they
[56:23.880 --> 56:30.920]  could pull at the world's hearts and make it look like this was all the doing
[56:30.920 --> 56:35.640]  of Assad in Syria. Actually, these were coming from the million or so that are
[56:35.640 --> 56:40.440]  in Turkish camps. And they were including Pakistanis and everybody else. But it was
[56:40.440 --> 56:49.160]  all to make Assad look like the boogeyman. And that also, and if I may say this,
[56:49.160 --> 56:56.040]  I'm a little nervous here, Putin already saw the game when Orlan or France and
[56:56.040 --> 57:02.120]  Cameron were threatening to strike Syria saying this kind of stuff has to stop.
[57:02.120 --> 57:08.520]  But this was all the setup. This was attack 2.0. 1.0 was the Ghouta gassing,
[57:08.520 --> 57:15.080]  which was another false flag. So Putin already beat them to the punch by sending
[57:15.080 --> 57:22.280]  MiG-31s because he knew that that would stop them from bombing. Just having a
[57:22.280 --> 57:28.440]  free Turkey shoot in Syria by these NATO. So that has completely stopped them in
[57:28.440 --> 57:35.080]  their tracks. And the second thing is, as an observer, I think Russia and China have
[57:35.080 --> 57:39.480]  just had too much, not so much Iran, but they're going to join in. They've just
[57:39.480 --> 57:43.960]  said, this is where we're going to have our stand with American exceptionalism,
[57:43.960 --> 57:49.480]  this kind of exceptionalism. And they're going to make a point here. And Saudi
[57:49.480 --> 57:53.480]  Arabia is just a, you know, it's just a lightweight. These guys can't fight. These
[57:53.480 --> 57:59.160]  are punks who frequent the bordellos in Paris and western capitals, but can't fight.
[57:59.160 --> 58:05.000]  These people, the Yemenis are knocking their socks off. These guys are knocking their
[58:06.120 --> 58:11.080]  high-powered planes out of the air. So these people are not even affected. All they have is
[58:11.080 --> 58:15.240]  money and armaments to have other people do it. So that is all. And thank you very much.
[58:15.240 --> 58:20.600]  Well, I tend to agree with you. But again, what is our government thinking, putting
[58:20.600 --> 58:25.080]  America in the position of being totally wicked? It's so obvious to the whole world.
[58:25.080 --> 58:27.000]  Do you agree with me? This is a larger setup.
[58:30.040 --> 58:34.520]  It is. But also, you know, I have to say this after Vietnam and Korea.
[58:35.080 --> 58:38.280]  Hold on. Stay there. I'm going to come back to you. I'm going to go to everybody else.
[58:38.280 --> 58:40.200]  Stay with us, folks. Back in one minute.

[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:27.640]  We're taking phone calls right now on the build-up to what clearly can turn into World War
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:32.920]  III if you've just joined us. There's also another video feed we have up on infowars.com.
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:37.640]  Livestream, infowars announces second amendment flash rally at UT Austin.
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:42.280]  It was two nights ago. I noticed that they were going to have a Bloomberg group
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:46.840]  that normally only has five or six anti-gunners at their events. This is a bigger one. Looks
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:51.400]  like they may have as many as eight people. Al Jazeera and others will announce that they
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:55.880]  had hundreds of thousands. I'm not kidding. I've seen them in DC. They had 200,000. It was like
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:59.480]  1,000. It looks like they've got about eight or nine people there. Let me see. One, two, three,
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:04.200]  four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, maybe 11. So that's a record crowd right there. The
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:11.080]  statesmen will probably report they had 5,000. And so we're down there to cover what's happening.
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:16.360]  Joe Biggs is going to be joining us popping in at the start of the next segment and then on again,
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:22.120]  off again throughout this. But the live feed of him hopefully interviewing some of these folks
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:28.040]  will be there. But they're here to victimize, guilt us that any crimes with guns or gun owners
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:32.520]  fault. I mean, if somebody kills somebody with a Ford truck, you don't blame every other F-150
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:39.960]  owner. It's just crazy. So get out of Austin, Bloomberg. We see right through you. And there
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:45.640]  is a lot of folks out there that are exposing it. They've got signs up saying they're anti-gun
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:50.120]  with a gun with a slash through it. Oh, but they're not against government having guns
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:58.120]  or Mao Zedong having guns. So we're just there exposing it. And Joe Biggs is out there again
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:02.840]  doing interviews right now with folks. He'll be popping in with us and I'll go back to your calls
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:09.400]  and back to Joe Biggs here in the next hour. Habu calling in from Wisconsin. You were finishing
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:15.000]  up your point. I know America isn't perfect, but I did study the Soviet Union. And I mean,
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.560]  it really was corrupt and out of control. So I could see some of the arguments of opposing.
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:23.720]  But now we're just adopting everything the Soviet Union promoted. They're going in the
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:28.840]  opposite direction. The roles are totally reversed. And the people running our government are waging
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:35.080]  war on our freedoms. And they're also launching these incredibly evil destabilization moves
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:39.800]  that we know are meant to make the Middle East and Africa, you know, go back into the Stone Age.
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:46.360]  It's just so brazen. It's so out in the open. And I really think they've gone too far. And as you
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:54.040]  said, Russia especially knows that it's being destabilized to be destroyed. So they know they've
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:59.160]  got to go ahead and fight back. Putin, I don't see as some super mastermind who's had a bunch of
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:04.680]  victories as the media spends it. Putin laid down to the Iraq takeover, laid down to Afghanistan
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:10.280]  takeover, laid down to four or five countries being invaded. And only now because of Ukraine
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:13.960]  is standing up. I mean, I was wondering when the Russians were going to do something.
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:19.400]  And that tends to be the Russian paradigm in about seven different wars, not just Napoleon
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:24.920]  or Hitler is to lay down until the very end and then stand up. Go ahead. Where do you think this
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:31.800]  is going? You know, you're absolutely right. And I think Putin has bent over backwards to kind of
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:39.640]  accommodate and, you know, just be more accommodating, but not anymore. I think right now there are
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:46.920]  two hot wars, so to speak, Ukraine and Syria. And I think that Syria, you know, making a stand in
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:54.520]  Ukraine was just too close to home. But here, Syria is probably a better way for them to deal with
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:04:06.920]  with Saudi Arabia, United States, NATO. And I think if Saudi Arabia is so brazen as to, you
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:15.720]  know, do you recall it was also threatening Sochi Olympics? Yes. And he gave them a, Putin told
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:22.040]  them in no uncertain terms that there would be a hell to pay if they messed with it. And so they're
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:29.240]  doing the same thing again. You know, Saudi Arabia has got to be the worst nation on earth, bar none.
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:35.640]  It's got to be the worst, absolute worst and why we align ourselves with them. And because I suppose
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:40.600]  they buy our armaments and they're an outlet, plus they can manipulate the oil market. Well,
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:45.000]  they're sitting on top of Mecca so they can direct Islam. I mean, that's why British intelligence
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.920]  went and set up the Wahhabis to put them in charge is because they would do whatever they're told
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:54.440]  and they're super nasty people. I don't mean the Saudi Arabians themselves, they're being dead on,
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:05:00.920]  but the the disgusting house of Assad is truly filthy. Just when you think the government couldn't
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:06.600]  get any more ludicrous, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has taken to social media
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:12.920]  to point out the harmful effects of sunny days on plant life. That's right. The agency tweeted,
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:18.040]  think sunny days are good for plants, not always. Sunlight causes ozone to form,
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:24.280]  which harms foliage and weakens trees. Makes you wonder, how did the planet survive for millennia
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:29.080]  before a big bloated government came along to protect it? Let's just point out the absurdity
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:34.760]  of the EPA highlighting the alleged danger of sunlight as the world is facing numerous legitimate
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:39.160]  environmental issues, some of which have been caused by the agency itself. Let's not forget,
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:44.280]  this is the same agency that polluted the Animas River with more than three million gallons of
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:50.200]  toxic waste last month. In an effort to cover up that disaster, EPA officials refused to provide
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:56.200]  data to the press on the extent of the damage. Read the article, Obama's EPA warns sunlight
[01:05:56.200 --> 01:06:01.960]  dangerous to plants at infowars.com. Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to be able to bring you

[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:13.480]  my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico where the Chiapas

[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:26.440]  beans in a highly customized blend. Discover and try a bag of the Patriot blend 100% organic coffee

[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:42.760]  coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers. Drop by

[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:08.680]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:25.480]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:31.880]  Joe Biggs and Josh Owens are down at the University of Texas in downtown Austin.
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:35.720]  This radio slash TV transmission comes to you from deep in the heart of Texas.
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:39.960]  We're trying to work out some audio issues right now, but if you're a TV viewer
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:45.240]  at infowars.com forward slash show or on some cable and TV stations already picking up the
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:53.560]  transmission, you can see that UT police and Austin police have arrested at least two pro-gun
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:09:02.200]  demonstrators. One of them wearing an infowars.com shirt I can see because they dared hold up signs
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:09.240]  and on infowars.com in the article titled live stream info wars announces second amendment
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:14.680]  flash rally at UT Austin. The anti-gunners are in there saying we're going to be there
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:19.800]  with the police to make sure you don't have free speech. This is our rally. Well funny,
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:25.560]  we've had rallies at UT in the Capitol probably let's not exaggerate 200 times. I've probably
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:31.800]  been involved in 100 of those the last 20 years. Probably more than 100. Maybe 300 total and I've
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:35.960]  been involved 150. I don't know. And they're always there with their signs. They're always
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:42.440]  there talking to the media. But see, oh now UT, if you're not a student sanctioned group or not
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:49.560]  sanctioned by the university, why you're going to jail. And there you have it, the taxpayer paid for
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:55.800]  tolerant university. And if you were watching five minutes ago, you were able to see it's a
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:10:00.440]  separate feed than this show. You have two feeds going right now. They had signs up. That's what
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:08.520]  they're arrested for was having signs. You're not allowed to go to the Bloomberg event where he
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:14.200]  spends billions of dollars all over the country trying to get our guns. You're not allowed to do
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:20.600]  that. You are arrested if you hold up a sign and engage in free speech. Oh, the universities are so
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:27.400]  free. Biggs is ready. Let's go ahead and go to Joe Biggs as they show them being the political
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:32.600]  criminals, the political prisoners. Let's go to Joe Biggs reporting from University of Texas.
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:36.840]  Everybody's got to get down there now, folks, to witness the destruction of the first amendment,
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:41.640]  not just the second. Joe Biggs. Roger that. Joe Biggs here at info with info wars.com. We're
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:45.640]  standing at the UT campus. And as you could have seen just a second ago, two people were arrested
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:50.440]  for protesting. Now they stood behind the anti gun protesters and held up their signs, saying that
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:55.960]  they were for campus carry. The cops came over, took them away, denied them the ability of freedom
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:11:01.880]  of speech. Meanwhile, letting this rhetoric go on over here. They're not going to bother them at
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:07.320]  all because it's okay for these anti gunners to be out here and talk about stuff completely ignoring
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:12.280]  the fact that one in five women here get raped and denying them that ability to protect themselves.
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:15.400]  They think that when campus carry passes, there'll be a whole bunch of people running around with
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:20.040]  guns. That's a negative. Most of the students here from 18 to 20 in the state of Texas to have a
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:24.440]  chl you have to be 21 or older. Most of those people are probably going to be a lot of the vets
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:28.360]  you're coming back to using their GI bill. And just because you have campus carry doesn't mean
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:33.000]  that people will be doing it. They just have that ability, that right to make that decision if they
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.320]  want. That's right. That's why the Bloomberg people are here is the state legislature has moved
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:43.560]  to allow people to be armed on campus. Criminals are going to be armed regardless of what there's
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:48.120]  a law or not. But here are the Bloomberg people. When they were here two years ago, we have it
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:53.800]  on video with councilmember Mike Martinez saying after we register, we will confiscate Austin
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:58.840]  night's guns. We have them on video with them hitting us in the head with their signs. We didn't
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:03.480]  even ask the cops to arrest them. We allowed them to have their free speech. But here they are
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:08.520]  running around. Now I was watching a live feed during a break, correct me if I'm wrong Joe Biggs
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:14.040]  down there. They arrested the pro gunners for only holding up signs, correct? Yes, they weren't doing
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:18.760]  anything except standing behind the crowd of anti gun people. And then the cops rushed over like
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:23.160]  a bunch of Nazis and took away their ability to have freedom of speech and threw them in the back
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:27.240]  of a car and just took them downtown. Now we got two feeds. You're back there where the anti gunners
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:32.040]  are. Josh is showing us a feed where they're taking them to jail. Please continue with what you've
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:36.200]  been witnessing with these anti gunners. We're going to walk over here right now. There's a
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:41.080]  large group of people over here. They've had people coming up singing songs, basically just
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:47.640]  spreading a whole bunch of lies. They're saying that having students on campus. Again, we've got
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:53.560]  audio skype. They're not making the campus safer. They're saying that having guns on campus will
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:13:02.200]  make it more dangerous and not as safe. So they've already got 160 professors here at the college
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:08.440]  who have signed it to deny that law, that right that's been passed campus carry. Now that's
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:15.560]  going to go into effect until August of 26. But people are going to deny it. Joe, your skype's
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:19.400]  breaking up. I'm going to give you a moment for that to stabilize. I see Jakari Jackson's in the
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:24.360]  control room. That means he probably wants to say something. Jakari, what's your view on the
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:30.120]  situation? Pretty powerful footage. One camera is giving us HD quality and we can see the people
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:34.520]  being arrested. The other is degrading that Biggs has. We're going to go back to Biggs in a moment.
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:38.920]  Jakari Jackson in studio. What's your take? Yeah, this is pretty ridiculous, Alex, because I have
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:42.440]  to do the nightly news tonight. I wasn't even planning to go down there because, you know,
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:46.760]  Biggs is going to do a great job. But after seeing this, the guy that you see on the camera right
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:51.560]  there wearing the Info Wars shirt, that's AJ. I've marched with him numerous times. You know,
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:55.960]  he's not a troublemaker. He's a veteran matter of fact. And now they're going to arrest this guy
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:59.960]  for just holding up a sign in the United States of America. I think I might have to get in my car
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:05.000]  and go down to this UT campus to expose all the tear. And this is what a police state looks like
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.640]  when you can't even hold up a sign on a college campus. These guys aren't out there waving guns
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:14.040]  around. They're out there holding up a sign. And that's just too much for these people to accept
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:18.760]  at the University of Texas. Well, I'll tell you, these police officers are following shameful
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:23.720]  directives. Major universities have come out in the last month in their policy papers and said
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:28.920]  to students, there is no such thing as free speech. You don't hold up a sign. You don't talk to people
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:34.440]  about politics, or we will have you thrown off or put on academic suspension. And I have a good
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:42.120]  friend at UT going through the psychology department PhD and they told him, you will not criticize
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:47.160]  political correctness or you will be kicked off campus. And he was put on probation for his speech.
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:53.880]  If he makes one mistake, his entire paper thrown out, the liberals can make 100 mistakes and are
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:59.000]  just passed. And this guy's a liberal, by the way. He says it is a piranha of mental, just like
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:05.080]  piranhas Chikari. And this is what these universities are now, is nothing but Soviet brainwashing centers.
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:10.120]  Go ahead. Yeah, just like you were mentioning earlier, you know, when I first met these guys,
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:14.840]  as myself, David Knight and also David's wife, we went out to a rally that they were having at
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:19.720]  the Capitol building. And Mike Martinez was out there, the Austin City Council member, saying
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:23.400]  that, you know, we're going to make the gun ban legitimate. And you know, these people will go
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:27.560]  up to you, lie to your face. They lied to you and Gucci Artie, when you were in San Antonio,
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:32.120]  they said, we're not trying to ban any guns by simultaneously handing you a flyer says we want
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:37.880]  to ban all assault rifles. And Kid Daniels has the article out today, you're more likely to be stabbed
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:42.040]  with a knife than you are to be killed with a fully automatic rifle. You're more likely to have
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:46.600]  your brains beat out with a hammer than you are to be killed with a fully. We're going to come back
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:50.440]  to you in a moment, you're going to get suited up and go down there. Everybody should go down
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:54.920]  there, folks, because I knew the issue would be they'd arrest people for free speech. They're
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:59.960]  saying if you talk to someone about your views, that you're going to be arrested, because only
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:05.160]  the university decides who's allowed to speak, including students. This is beyond the old Soviet
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:10.760]  Union, beyond communist China today. America is falling to Salitarianism. Joe Biggs, we've gotten
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:18.280]  your Skype back, please continue. Oh, just now coming in. Did you say something? I'm sorry,
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:21.960]  you cut out. Yeah, it looks like somebody's over there telling you what you can and can't do.
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:25.400]  Oh, yeah, they're trying to tell us that, you know, you can only have to have a permit to be
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:29.320]  able to speak out here at the UT campus. Well, no, I know, turn the camera on him. That guy right
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:33.800]  there was just telling you that you can't, he's calling the police, I think. He was just saying
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:39.160]  you can't be a news reporter. You heard me a minute ago. No, I'm asking you. You don't want to repeat.
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:43.560]  I'm asking you. You don't even want to report it. I'm letting you report it. Why don't you say it?
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:48.280]  Okay. If they want to register to have a protest here, they can. This is a registered space
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:52.920]  for protest. It's been like that. That's ridiculous to register to have free speech.
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:57.160]  I need you to register to have this conversation with me. And then you guys think that it's only
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:01.320]  okay for cops to have guns. You ever heard of Samuel DeBose, who was murdered by a trained cop?
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:04.200]  You ever heard of Kelly Thomas, who was murdered by a trained cop? Let the moron talk.
[01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:12.120]  That's not accurate what you're saying. Oh, so you think the freedom of speech
[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:16.280]  is to get a permit from the government? Is that what you're saying? You're what's wrong with this
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:19.640]  country, sir? Correct me if I'm wrong, because I thought I heard him telling you you had to
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:22.840]  have permission to be reporting. Or did I hear that wrong? Come here and do a protest. They're
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:27.720]  just not allowed to do it. Yeah, that's the whole point. You can have a counter-protest.
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:32.040]  Yeah, they can. They can have a counter-protest over here. They were asked to leave the state.
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:36.200]  That's ridiculous. That's not true. UT says you got to have a permit to do one period.
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:39.800]  But you could ask the police if you'd like to have an interview to find out why they do that. We'd
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:43.960]  be happy to give you that information. No, I'm good. I can find it. Ask that guy who he is.
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:49.240]  Who? What's your name? You can ask my name is Jamie Bird. You can ask them about that. We'd be
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:53.720]  happy to set up an interview for you. If your interest is in understanding the story, we'd be
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:59.720]  happy to set that up. Okay, get him to say who he is with UT then. Get him. What's your job with
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:05.560]  UT? You can't even answer them, my question. I can't talk to all four of you guys. They want me
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:10.280]  to ask. What's your job with UT? I'm director of media outreach. And I'd be happy to set up an
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:15.560]  interview with the police so you could find out why they conduct operation like that. We're interested
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:21.320]  in letting you know why it happens that way. I can't answer like 35 questions at once for you guys.
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:25.880]  Okay, so we're not talking. Answer the question. Yeah. So if you're director of media, how come
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:29.240]  you're claiming we're not media? I mean, is this, I mean, I never claimed that. Yeah, you did. You
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:34.040]  just did. I never did. You did. Absolutely. I never said that. I heard you with both ears.
[01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:37.880]  You got it on tape. So you're gonna have to find that on tape. Let's start fight with him. Asking
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:42.840]  this question. I've been told if I come to speak at UT without a permit anywhere, I'll be thrown
[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:49.320]  off or arrested. So he's taken off. This is how they're using permitting and free speech zones.
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:56.200]  That's what they're doing. Thank you. Yeah, I mean, it's completely ridiculous that you've
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:19:01.400]  got to sign up to be able to have the ability to say what you want to say. The point is they come
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:05.560]  to UT. They're gonna use guys, they're gonna use guys with guns to come bull you and put you in
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:09.240]  the back of the jail. But then they want to complain about guns. I mean, it's completely
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:13.800]  ridiculous. Let's just disarm everybody. Let's ban cars because there's what, let's see how many
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:19.160]  people die a year from cars. Let's ban those two. I think cars are ridiculous because somebody gets
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:30.600]  food to death. 34,485 people were killed by cars last year. So we should ban those. Meanwhile,
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:37.960]  11,493 people were killed by weapons most of the time. Joe Biggs, stay there. I know we've got
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:42.840]  Charlene Garrett, Robert Chris and Chris and others holding. I want to talk to Chris who's an

[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:06.440]  supplement to boost omega-3s is a good idea, but did you know that about 60% of Americans are actually
[01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:11.960]  deficient in omega-3s? Did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% omega-3s
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:17.320]  and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat? Heck, did you know that more than 90% of fish

[01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:09.640]  By the way, you're listening to the Alex Jones show. My original cameraman and radio producer,
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:13.720]  the guy that sent guests up for the show, Mike Hansen. He's been around almost as long as Buckley
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:18.840]  Hammond. He lives out in Gonzalez, Texas, and took over his family business when his grandfather died.
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:23.160]  He said the ATF and other people have been all over the town the last year, basically taking
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:28.360]  over the police department. He called me frantically during a break earlier and said there's ATF
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:34.040]  everywhere, raiding people's houses, roadblocks, pointing guns at children. He says there's just
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:40.760]  hundreds of feds running around in Gonzalez, Texas, a small town right now. And he's been
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:45.000]  frantically calling me during the break. Buckley, can you come in here and call Mike Hansen back?
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.640]  I mean, it's just he was arguing with them and confronting them. And then the phone went dead
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:56.600]  last time I talked to him. So things have really gotten crazy. Here it is. You can see him frantically
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:01.400]  calling. As the gun grabbing goes on covertly around the country, and they're doing gun
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:07.400]  confiscations all over the nation with ATF groups against veterans, people with PTSD,
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:12.360]  folks they think didn't buy a gun correctly. It's mainly a war on law abiding citizens.
[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:15.800]  We're going to continue to cover what's happening at the Capitol next segment. Just a few minutes.
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:21.480]  I'm going to Charlene and other callers that are patiently holding on the epic level situation
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:25.800]  in Syria. I'm going to recap that, get into the latest on that front. And then the political
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:31.000]  correctness as well that's taking place. What's happening in the economy. I mean, it is insane
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:37.400]  asylum level. I can't believe how crazy things are getting. But tyrants just keep going and going until
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:43.880]  they hit a brick wall historically. And they do fantastical crazy things like our government
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:49.320]  openly aiding al-Qaeda, openly aiding ISIS, same group. The Russians just blew up the al-Qaeda
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:55.720]  command base in Syria. And Reuters said, no one knows why the Russians attack the moderate al-Qaeda
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:26:01.080]  group. It actually says al-Qaeda in Reuters. Russian warplanes target insurgents of Syria,
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:06.440]  but not Islamic state. And the Pentagon is criticizing him for bombing the moderate al-Nusra
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:13.800]  front and al-Qaeda Syrian branch. That's who runs it. That's who commands ISIS.
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:19.080]  Joe Biggs, what is it like for you being an army vet who fought al-Qaeda in Iraq and Syria,
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:24.920]  got wounded quite a few times to now see our government openly arming and aiding al-Qaeda
[01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:29.880]  while our government tries to take our guns, Joe? It's completely disgusting, Alex. I mean,
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:33.800]  the fact that you go over there because you want to protect your country, you want to do the right
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:38.360]  thing, and then to find out that you're lied to, then you find out that the country that you
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:44.600]  were trying to help stabilize, they pull everyone out, they create ISIS, they take over ISIS,
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:50.280]  and then the supposed enemy, we start arming them. And we start allowing them to grow,
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:54.840]  and they're taking over oil fields. And now they're one of the richest terrorist organizations
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:59.720]  in the world. And the government denies that they're helping them, but we keep getting proof day
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:04.680]  in and day out that our government is allowing these guys to be armed. I'm seeing pictures every
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:11.160]  day by al-Nusra members on Twitter holding U.S. Army weapons, SAWS, which is a squad automatic
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:18.040]  weapon, a 240 Bravo, M14 sniper rifles, M4s. That's completely ridiculous. Those guys are being
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:23.560]  dropped off our weapons to use against our people. They admit they give it to quote al-Nusra,
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:28.680]  the moderate group that's commanded by the CIA and others, then they give it to the radical ISIS
[01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:33.320]  people. I mean, that's ridiculous. Al-Qaeda is just as bad as ISIS and the same group, Joe.
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:40.120]  Yeah, exactly. I mean, as soon as with al-Nusra, basically all they are is just like a stepping
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:43.640]  stone. People go in there, they kind of get warmed up, and then they move over into ISIS. It's kind
[01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:47.320]  of just like a little stepping stone for some people who kind of want to go over there, but
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:51.320]  then they're not quite ready. These guys, as soon as they get a little pressure on them, they just
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:56.760]  give everything off to ISIS. They're like, all right, you guys take it. It's a plausible deniability
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:01.640]  membrane, so the West doesn't get caught arming IS. Now, that's why the Russians just blew it up,
[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:05.400]  because they know the head of the snake. And I say, great job. Hope you kill all the al-Qaeda
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:12.040]  people, Russia. Great job. I mean, I don't see anybody would have a problem with Putin doing
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:15.400]  that. If he wants to step in and take over, we've spent enough money in these wars. We've
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:19.560]  spent enough American lives in these wars. I think it's fine for someone else to come in
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:23.720]  and take over. Well, especially as they're killing al-Qaeda, you're about to go to break. I'm going
[01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:27.320]  to come back and finish up with you and go to calls. But I notice I am hearing some cheering.
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:32.600]  There are about 10 people on the stage flown in by Bloomberg, and they did find some UT idiots to
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:38.440]  come out, I guess. But some of them are pro-gunners and calls for taking our guns, I guess. Yeah,
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:45.560]  they're all screaming gun for UT, gun for UT. They're all getting up, telling sad little sob stories,
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:50.520]  completely ignoring the fact that one in five women are raped and denying them the right to
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:56.120]  be able to protect themselves. They said that people on campus that have guns will make it more
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:29:03.880]  dangerous. Well, there's also police. They said police should only be armed. I guess they forget
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:08.040]  the fact that people like Kelly Thomas who were murdered by trained police officers, people like
[01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:12.520]  Sam DeBose who were shot and killed because he was missing a license plate. Those are the kind
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:16.920]  of people that we want to have to have only the guns. That makes a lot of sense. Now that's a recipe
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:21.560]  for tyranny. We need a separation of powers, a division of powers, a balance of powers,
[01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:25.880]  and that's what this comes down to. And look, these people right to your face, the very same
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:29.960]  Bloomberg group, very some people that are there today that travel around the country,
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:34.120]  they have said to my face, Joe, we'll come back and talk about this, that no one wants your guns,
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:38.760]  no one's trying to take your guns, and then their own handout says ban all the guns, basically.
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:44.120]  And as you said, they're chanting right now, only police should have guns. Yeah, that's called
[01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:51.720]  North Korea, you idiots. We'll be back, stay with us. We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:55.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:04.680]  Have you waited your whole life to become a mother? Well, you're probably a racist,
[01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:10.600]  sexist homophobe. LGBT activists have already convinced the Midwives Alliance of North America
[01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:16.680]  to stop referring to their clients as women and mothers, and instead call them pregnant people
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:22.600]  and birthing individuals so transsexuals won't get offended. Numerous midwives have protested
[01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:27.320]  this language change, calling it an attack on women. In an open letter, they say,
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:32.840]  by embracing the idea that any human other than those in a class called women can carry offspring
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:39.720]  to term, give birth to them, and nurse them, we are prioritizing gender identity over biological
[01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:45.720]  reality. Obviously, this ideology contributes to the cultural erasure of women's unique power to
[01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:52.440]  give birth. It is encoded in our female bodies. That's what creates, nourishes, and births live
[01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:55.960]  offspring. For more reports, visit infowars.com.
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:02.520]  I want more candy. I want more videos here. Why, why, why?
[01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:07.480]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true
[01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:13.320]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus. All of our children
[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:18.600]  are hit with modern mind control. Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:23.240]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily
[01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:28.360]  by globalist concoctions. It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on
[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:33.160]  dangerous psychotropic drugs. Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the
[01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:37.400]  highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take. We worked with the leading

[01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:24.120]  Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:52.920]  It is a serious crisis. We're going to have a guest join us in the third hour, Joel Scalzen,
[01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:57.160]  the World Affairs Brief, who's been warning of these confrontations coming. I know he'll
[01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:01.560]  probably have a little bit different interpretation than I do, but that's what it's all about,
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:06.600]  getting different perspectives. But this is how it happens. You wake up and wars have escalated,
[01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:13.960]  and now it's the potential for World War III or what the globalists call World War IV.
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:19.400]  I want to go to Chris and Charlene and Dave and others. I know you've been holding. What happens
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:24.200]  is I get a bunch of calls, then I take some, then we get the next guest on, and by the time I get to
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:28.520]  your calls, it's been an hour. But I appreciate you calling to give us your take on the serious
[01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:37.240]  situation. But it really is unprecedented because America started the destabilization
[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:42.440]  of the Middle East on purpose under globalist control. And now we're backing the nastiest,
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:48.360]  most horrible people, and John McCain's saying, let's give any aircraft missiles to Al-Nusra,
[01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:57.560]  which is Al-Qaeda. And he meets with Al-Qaeda. That's Reuters, Al-Qaeda. The Pentagon is upset
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:05.240]  that the moderate rebels, Al-Qaeda, they say Al-Qaeda with a straight face. The Pentagon's upset,
[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:10.520]  and so is NATO, and so is Turkey, and so is Israel, that the Russians are hitting the
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:17.960]  moderates, Al-Qaeda, that came in from out of the country to attack. They're mainly Turkish
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:23.480]  refugees from other parts of the world that came into Syria and couldn't take over, couldn't take
[01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:27.800]  over people's houses, couldn't take over their farms. So now they've run into Turkey. They're not
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:35.000]  Syrian. They're part of the invasion force. And so, oh, we'll just take you to Europe. So now they
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:39.560]  can blow stuff up here. And don't worry, government will be more than happy to take our freedoms then
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:43.960]  to keep us safe. I want to go directly to your calls, but finishing up with Joe Biggs,
[01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:48.920]  then we'll pop in with him in the next hour with new developments as they unfold.
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:54.920]  Down there with the Bloomberg gun confiscation movement, getting huge press coverage. There's
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:36:01.400]  10 people leading it, a few hundred UT people out there, a mix of pro-gunners, anti-gunners,
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:08.360]  and they say gun-free UT, but they had men with guns show up, and anybody else holding up signs
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:13.880]  in the crowd, which the anti-gunners always do at our events, was arrested at gunpoint. So they
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:19.240]  don't really mean a gun-free UT. They mean a free speech, free, and only the state having the
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:25.000]  monopoly of force. Joe Biggs, final comments for now. So there was a professor who just spoke.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:29.720]  She goes, I'm a feminist anti-gun professor. I'm not open to debate, but I'm willing to
[01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:34.120]  listen to your concerns, but there's no debate here. What is that? You're not open to debate.
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:38.840]  Just double-speak. Say that again. That's the essence. That's why feminists are loony.
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:44.120]  There you go. I'm not open to debate, but I will not listen to you and you're not allowed to speak.
[01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:48.280]  And then they're sitting here, they're like, well, thank you for coming out to this free speech
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:53.080]  event. Meanwhile, they called cops to come over and arrest people for freedom of speech. Well,
[01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:58.520]  that's their double-speak. It's completely mind-blowing. They're sitting there saying, well,
[01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:02.600]  there was a guy in Virginia Tech who was shot by a gun, and he had no chance. Well,
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:05.560]  maybe if he had a gun and had some proper training, he could have took out the guy.
[01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:13.080]  Maybe if more people were out here caring. Well, these people are communalists,
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:17.880]  but in a bad way, they're collectivists. So if someone commits a crime with a baseball bat,
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:22.200]  therefore all baseball bats are bad, they just don't get that if somebody else says something
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:29.480]  bad, it doesn't mean I lose my freedoms. Yeah, 11,495 people killed by guns last year. 34,000,
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:36.600]  I think 34,500 were killed by motor vehicles. So let's ban cars. Those things seem way more
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:41.880]  dangerous. Three times more people are killed by knives than by guns every year. It's like 500,000
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:46.760]  people died from tobacco. Let's ban cigarettes. Let's just ban everything. No one has the freedom
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:50.760]  to decide what they want to do. I think campus carries great for a reason. That doesn't mean
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:54.440]  that everybody out here is going to be running around with a gun, but there'll be the ability
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:58.760]  to make that decision. Hey, I don't feel safe. I want to make this decision to be able to do it
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:03.320]  and not be hassled because some people just would rather be prepared than unprepared. Well, Joe,
[01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:08.520]  here's the deal. We've been on the defensive with gun grabbers for decades. Now we're on the offense.
[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:13.000]  All over the country, we're getting concealed carry crime drops by 25% on average within two
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:18.040]  years. Some areas even lower open carry crime drops even more. They know we're winning the fight.
[01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:21.560]  They admit we're winning the fight. So they're turning up the heat and they might pull some
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:26.680]  other staged events to play the part of victims. We don't accept their guilt. We don't accept them
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:32.440]  guilt slinging at us. We're not putting up with it. Joe, go get Josh. Do some dynamite man on the
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:38.440]  street interviews with these morons. Let's really show people how dumb the anti-gunners are. Let's
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:42.760]  really talk to them. Let's ask them if we should ban cars because somebody runs over somebody with
[01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:49.320]  a Chevy Silverado. Is it the fault of all Chevy Silverados? Well, it's not the fault of the car
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:54.360]  if you're a transgendered hero like Caitlyn Jenner. Then you can run over somebody with a car and get
[01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:59.800]  away with it. Then it's okay then. Well, I would also ask them about all the anti-free speech
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:05.000]  movements taking place. And you know, why is it that in North Korea, the citizens can't own guns?
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:10.520]  Don't they get it? That human empowerment is about believing in the individual? Joe Biggs,
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:14.440]  I'll give us an update next hour. Thank you so much. Jakari is about to be joining you down there.
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:20.520]  Thank you. Okay, I appreciate folks holding. Let's go to your calls right now. Let's shift gears
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:26.280]  back to the international geopolitical stage. I do not have words to describe, as I have said,
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:33.640]  the nakedness of the evil with our government for five years funding an Arab Spring to overthrow
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:39.480]  moderate leaders and then put jihadists in from Saudi Arabia who are allowed to recruit all over
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:46.360]  the West online and in person to fly to these countries to then be given weapons by the West
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:50.600]  to run around blowing up every church they get their filthy hands on, blowing up every
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:56.200]  antiquity they get their filthy hands on, murdering non-radical Muslims, murdering Shiites,
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:40:05.080]  murdering Alawites, murdering Jews, blowing up museums. In one case, 200 plus men raped a
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:11.080]  woman till she died, chopping women's heads off, chopping children's heads off, selling children
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:16.760]  into sex slavery. I mean, it is just insane destabilizing everything
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:24.920]  and saying, well, Iran's our enemy and Russia's our enemy. So we're allowed to start wars on their
[01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:31.560]  borders. Well, Iran didn't try to take my guns. China didn't try to take my guns. Russia didn't
[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:37.320]  try to take my guns. They're not trying to feed me GMO. I really don't like to comment
[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:42.600]  Chinese leadership. Everybody knows that, but they're not the ones in my backyard. China is
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:46.120]  starting to get some media censored in the US and I've attacked them for it, but Russia,
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:52.120]  Russia's done nothing to me. And then they put out this weird propaganda almost every week.
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:56.440]  They had one in the Houston Chronicle last week that Alex Jones might be a Russian agent. Yeah,
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:41:02.440]  that's directed folks by the White House that if you don't want to have war with Russia and you
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:08.200]  don't want to back al-Qaeda, you must be a risky agent. Well, you know, it's funny, the neocons
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:14.840]  were actually Trotskyites and Stalin arrested a bunch of them and Leon Trotsky ran to Mexico
[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:21.960]  and then he got killed down there by a assassin, a Stalin's assassin, with an ice pick with an ice
[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:27.880]  hatchet. And then a couple hundred of his followers with all the money they put in bank
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:32.920]  accounts in the US and in Brooklyn ran back to the United States where they'd come from.
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:37.080]  They'd helped start the Bolshevik Revolution, they'd come over from New York City,
[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:42.760]  and now they're the neocon movement in America. So what's funny is, neocons are claiming I'm a
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:49.560]  Russian agent. These people have gone to Russia, overthrown Russia, created modern communism,
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:54.680]  and then have the nerve to sit here and tell me that I don't want to have nuclear war with Russia
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:42:02.440]  that's not communist now, that I'm some type of evil agent. I mean, they have the former host
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:09.080]  of Crossfire, puts out articles every month, ought to get him on, Kincaid, the most, but
[01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:16.040]  actually trying to make the case that I'm like KGB, folks. And I guarantee you,
[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:19.960]  none of these people making that statement have one-tenth the Americana pedigree I do,
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:26.600]  I don't mind bragging about it, but it's just Americana as you can get. It's like a royal flush
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:33.080]  of Americana, both sides of my family, sickeningly Americana. If there was American royalty, I'd be
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:40.520]  it, folks, okay? And I sit here and I watch this crash tell me that I'm a Russian agent
[01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:45.400]  because I don't want to have a nuclear war. You people are agents of evil and agents of corruption
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:49.640]  and you know what, you claim you're taking over the world to spread democracy and freedom,
[01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:53.720]  George Soros trying to teach kids how to be transgender and all this stuff and
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:57.560]  funding right-wing Nazis in Ukraine. Well, if that's what America is spreading, I don't want
[01:42:57.560 --> 01:43:03.800]  any part of it. The truth is, this isn't America. This is about your foreign banks running America
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:08.680]  into the ground. We want our coal plants turned back on. We want our borders control. We want
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:13.320]  our taxes cut. We want our private property and our gun rights and our parental rights back and
[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:17.640]  our bill of rights and our Constitution and the red, white and blue and mom and apple pie and
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:23.080]  John Wayne and fast cars. That's who we are. We are America. And any enemy that tries to
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:29.000]  sit or acclaim that this broadcast and what we push isn't 110 percent, red, white and blue
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:34.120]  is a piece of trash filth. And I dare you to say it to my face because I will hammer your
[01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:39.960]  nose into your head. I am sick of you trash talking little cowardly people that are selling this
[01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:44.840]  country out. Let's go ahead and talk to Chris and then Charlene. Chris and Indiana, thanks for
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:50.600]  holding her on the air. I had no problem Alex. Hey, I woke up this morning and I just got on
[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:55.960]  fire after seeing that trader John McCain and his Fox will seven minutes of fame. It just
[01:43:55.960 --> 01:44:02.440]  completely set me off. It reminds me of, you know, I was in Iraq in 2006, 2007 during the so-called
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:08.040]  civil war and I was over there babysitting, but you know, bears can back it up everything like
[01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:13.560]  that too, but I was over in Spiker and I was over in Anaconda and it was just complete farce.
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:20.520]  And I was over there and I got the DVD for the BBC documentary, Nightmare, Power of Nightmares.
[01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:25.080]  All right. And that just like, totally with everything that you're saying. Excellent film.
[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:29.960]  Yes, exactly. That's exactly what I'm talking about because it started out with the neocon movement
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:34.840]  and how they use the power of nightmares to just brainwash everybody and how in the 70s and 80s,
[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:39.800]  they did exactly what they're doing right now. It says now we're on a larger scale and we got
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:43.560]  media and internet to just blow it out of proportion, but it's the same exact thing that
[01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:48.680]  happened then. And you know, it's only because we're trying to kick the people out. There aren't
[01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:54.040]  puppets over there anymore. I mean, you know, we kicked out, um, uh, you know, in Libya, we kicked
[01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:58.440]  out Gaddafi because he wasn't our company. And here's the deal. Gaddafi invested all his money in
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:03.880]  the West basically. He apologized, but then Egypt was our total ally, done nothing to us.
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:10.120]  Syria, done nothing. It's not like they're overturning some bad guy. They are putting in al-Qaeda in
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:16.680]  the place of these other people to murder every Christian. That is a war crime. Exactly. It's
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:21.720]  just like they did with the Muslim Brotherhood, who did his exact same name back in the 70s and 80s
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:25.720]  in Egypt and everything. But that movie or that documentary just completely outlines. And you
[01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:30.680]  know, I mean, you know, look, uh, to Don was trying to play in a gold standard and prioritized
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:34.280]  his oil. Well, we can't have that because you don't have raw child bank. So we got to
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:39.800]  Saddam Hussein was from an earlier CIA project of Eisenhower. He'd been put in power in 79. He
[01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:45.800]  worked for the CIA from 57 on. He was told to invade Kuwait. He was set up. He was a strong man.
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:51.560]  He did bad things, but he was set up by the West and betrayed because he tried to make his people
[01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:57.640]  prosperous. And that's why they did that to Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein was a angel compared to
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:03.400]  Al Qaeda. Yeah, it's the same correlation as Hitler. It's just he was the next generation after
[01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:08.360]  Hitler, because they, you know, he was set up with a Nazi party and over in the West,
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:12.360]  British intelligence set Hitler up as well and had a secret treaty with him and told him to do
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:17.080]  everything he did and then set him up. Absolutely. That's all declassified as well. God bless you,
[01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:22.680]  sir. Appreciate your call. Here's the John McCain clip one more time from Fox News saying, give them
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:26.040]  anti aircraft missiles. Yeah, you've already given them any tank weapons. You already gave them
[01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:31.320]  anti aircraft missiles in Benghazi. So let's give Al Qaeda the moderates. That's in Reuters. They say
[01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:35.960]  Al Qaeda is the moderates 30 air strikes by the Russians alone on the Al Qaeda base.
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:41.960]  And our government is criticizing the Russians for bombing Al Qaeda. Just just take this article
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:47.320]  and frame it and put it on the wall. And now you're a Russian agency. All of you listening who don't
[01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:54.760]  support Al Qaeda, you're an anti American trash, according to the neocons. You support Al Qaeda,
[01:46:54.760 --> 01:47:00.440]  chopping Christians heads off, or you're a Rusky agent just like me. I'm serious. This is how they
[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:06.600]  operate. Let's go to that clip. But if they are attacking the very guys who we want to see topple
[01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:14.440]  aside, you would let American planes just to pass them and let them do that? No, but I might do
[01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:20.040]  what we did in Afghanistan many years ago to give those guys the ability to shoot down those planes.
[01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:26.680]  That equipment is available. Who would be shooting them down? The Free Syrian Army,
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:32.040]  just like the Afghan shot down the Russian. No, just like the Russian, the Afghan shot down Russian
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:36.440]  planes after Russia invaded Afghanistan. But you hear what I'm saying? I mean, you could see how
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:41.560]  easily, as you pointed out to me in prior visits, how easily. Let's go to Charlene in Pennsylvania
[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:50.680]  here on the air. Thanks for holding. Hello. Hi, go ahead. How about a couple questions? First,
[01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:57.080]  why won't our military go in and arrest Obama for doing all this stuff to our country, killing our
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:48:02.680]  people? Look, he's sending in our troops over into these war zones and they're being slaughtered.
[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:07.560]  They can see that he's a military coup, though, even though we have an illegitimate government,
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:11.960]  an occupational government. The public's not fully educated on that yet. And we would need
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:18.760]  Congress to call for the president to be indicted, basically. We would need to be with impeachment.
[01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:23.400]  And then if the president did try to block impeachment, then you could have, if you had a good
[01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:29.880]  speaker of the house, you know, direct with the military that the president be put in chains by
[01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:37.720]  the Marines and then brought before the Senate for trial. So a military coup is very, very dangerous.
[01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:42.360]  And there's still moles. Even if you get rid of Obama, they've got their operatives everywhere.
[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:46.200]  So you'd have to arrest a lot of these new generals they've put in. You'd have to arrest a bunch of
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:50.760]  members of Congress. You'd have to probably arrest about a third of the upper echelon of the government.
[01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:55.160]  So we're totally infested, ma'am. I mean, you're not just going to remove Obama and everything
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:49:01.400]  that's better. Do you see what I'm saying? Yes. And who's funding these refugees to come over here?
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:07.240]  They're not swimming. Oh, no. Obama tells them to come by plane. And they're going to take,
[01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:11.880]  it was 10,000 and 300,000. They're now announcing they want to bring in the next two years, one
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:19.080]  million refugees, basically jihadists, who weren't able to overthrow Assad. So that's their relocation
[01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:24.280]  program. They failed pouring in from all over the world to defeat Assad and the Russians. And so
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:27.800]  now they're going to come here. And then you're going to pay for them. I'm going to pay for them.
[01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:34.040]  Charlene. Terrorists can kill us. And then when they kill you, they'll double Homeland Security's
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:39.560]  funding and announce it's for gun owners. Yes. No, I'm serious. I mean, they say the number one
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:44.040]  terror threat is gun owners and veterans. But our military still won't stop him.
[01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:50.680]  No, they've all been listed as terrorists by the criminals. I mean, when the federal government
[01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:55.320]  announces vets of the number one terrorist and are training 24 seven to take guns, you've got a
[01:49:55.320 --> 01:50:00.440]  foreign takeover government. I mean, we have an occupied federal government. Why won't the Congress
[01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:04.600]  do anything? Why won't the Senate do anything? Well, it's like at all Hitler. I mean, I mean,
[01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:09.240]  why does anything to him or Stalin? I mean, it's look, look, a lot of people, the federal, let's
[01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:16.040]  be clear. And I'm not kissing the butt of the feds. It's true per capita. There's probably more awake
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:22.440]  feds than any other group in government. I mean, you don't think feds don't know how evil it is.
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:26.760]  You know how they're manipulated, how they're watched, how they're persecuted. If they don't
[01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:31.160]  play ball to be corrupt. I mean, the feds are incredibly awake. The military is incredibly
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:35.480]  awake. The police are incredibly away, even though they do some bad stuff. That's one reason the
[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:42.120]  globalists can't completely move yet is because take funding al-Qaeda. It's now just coming out.
[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:47.240]  That cripples the globalist because the more talk there is, the more the military notices
[01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:51.640]  what's going on. And then the compartmentalization breaks down. Charlene, thanks for your call.
[01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:58.440]  We're going to come back and talk to Chris in New York City, and then Dustin, Dave, Tanner, and others.
[01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:05.560]  Hi, this is Walt Augustinowitz. I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold. By now you've heard
[01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:09.400]  our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocketing. Ten years ago,
[01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:13.000]  I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:18.040]  talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID. I felt having
[01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:22.760]  to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy. Soon after, it was also
[01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:27.240]  announced that credit cards, debit cards, U.S. passports, hotel room keys, and even transit
[01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:32.600]  passes would all soon incorporate RFID. It was then I formed ID Stronghold to share my inventions
[01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:37.320]  and blocking RFID signals with the world. There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about
[01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:43.160]  RFID. I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected. Please go to idstronghold.com and
[01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:47.400]  get the facts, and the wallet sleeves or badge holders you need to protect your personal financial
[01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:51.960]  data. You'll be pleasantly surprised that through our direct sales model, you won't pay more than
[01:51:51.960 --> 01:52:08.600]  other comparable unprotected wallets. It is as though the protection is free. Visit idstronghold.com today.
[01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:29.400]  visit and the family you want to protect. Look, I've made predictions like this before. Thing is,
[01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:36.280]  I was right then too. A few years ago, I warned that housing prices would collapse. They did.
[01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:44.600]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash. They did. Those who listened
[01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:49.720]  had a chance to save themselves, but this has nothing to do with the stock market. This will
[01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:56.600]  affect us all. You can watch the video for free right now by going to dollardanger.com. Again,

[01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:15.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us. This is the last day you can get the lowest
[01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:24.280]  prices ever offered by my Patreon supply, high quality, storeable foods at infowarsstore.com.
[01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:27.880]  You can't go to my Patreon supplies website. You can't go anywhere else. You've got to go
[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:35.400]  to infowarsstore.com. Infowarsselect.com is a URL that will take you directly to the subpage
[01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:43.160]  of infowarsstore.com. That's infowarsselect.com where you can see their full selection at the
[01:54:43.160 --> 01:54:48.200]  lowest prices they ever offer. But that's their normal lowest prices. And you can buy
[01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:55.400]  from them. Or you can buy infowarsselect. It's the exact same food, made at the exact same time,
[01:54:55.400 --> 01:55:02.760]  highest quality, private labeled for infowarsselect. And you can get the lowest price they've ever
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:07.800]  offered in their history to anybody. I twisted their arm. I said, I really want to give people
[01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:12.760]  the incredibly lowest price. They gave it to me for two weeks. They extended it for one week.
[01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:18.280]  That three week special ends tonight at midnight. The highest quality, storeable foods you're going
[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:24.360]  to find in my view at the lowest price. It is extremely affordable. Everybody should be
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:30.920]  self-sufficient. It starts with food, water filtration, things like Pro Pure G2 at infowarsstore.com.
[01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:40.280]  You can also call toll free 888-253-3139. And finally,
[01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:47.800]  liver shield that you can take daily, known herbs that detoxify. Or you can do the full detox with
[01:55:47.800 --> 01:55:53.480]  the oxy powder, the apple cider vinegar, and the olive oil on the sixth day. And you've heard what
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:59.640]  people talk about. You can see the informational videos there at infowarsselect.com. It's amazing.
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:04.120]  That's sold out for three months. Then we got a small supply in for one week. That's sold out.
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:09.560]  We got a big supply in, but as hot as it is, it can be sold out in two weeks. Believe me, folks,
[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:17.400]  I don't know anybody. Dr. Group knows a few, but I don't know anybody that's not done this. It had
[01:56:17.400 --> 01:56:22.840]  amazing response. Now, some people kind of feel sick when they do it too. I mean, I want to warn
[01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:28.760]  you, this is not a joke. X2 is not a joke. Oxy powder is not a joke. I mean, these aren't joke
[01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:34.680]  products. This is not snake oil. This is the anti snake oil. We really set out to have true game
[01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:39.800]  changers and your purchases make the transmission possible. So it's a win-win. You cannot lose.
[01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:46.200]  Thank you all for your support. 888-253-3139 or infowarsselect.com.
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:49.720]  Chris in New York, thanks for holding. You're a trooper. You're on the air worldwide.
[01:56:51.720 --> 01:56:59.800]  Thank you, Alex. Real quick, I'm going to go fast through this. I think it's a shame that the U.S.
[01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:07.640]  is asking Russia to intervene in Syria, and now they are being slandered for because they
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:14.600]  attack the wrong person when they all find the same flag. It doesn't matter what name they use.
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:26.360]  This is Al-Nutra, Al-Qaeda, ISIS, ISIL, or IS. Number two, like you said,
[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:32.840]  the Russians in China are not trying to take your guns or force vaccinating your children
[01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:42.680]  or making you eat GMO foods by not labeling. No, Russian TV says GMOs designed to sterilize you
[01:57:42.680 --> 01:57:46.280]  and that they're giving too many vaccines. I know. It's like Russia's turning into infowarsse.
[01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:54.520]  Also, I think it's important that you might want to schedule an interview with Syrian girl
[01:57:54.520 --> 01:58:00.440]  with all this that is going on. We would like to hear from her. Absolutely. She's a Sunni.
[01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:04.440]  She's a Sunni. She didn't even like Assad. Her family are political dissidents that left,
[01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:09.160]  but she's against this backing of Al-Qaeda because she understands it's meant to break
[01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:15.960]  up Syria and she's a patriot. They want to make it a Shiite Sunni civil war, but most Sunnis are
[01:58:15.960 --> 01:58:21.400]  good people and don't want to be part of this as well. Great points. Anything else? Yeah,
[01:58:21.400 --> 01:58:29.320]  you mentioned earlier that the ATF was in Texas, I think it was. Yeah, I just talked to Mike Hansen
[01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:33.560]  earlier. They're just SWAT-teaming scores of homes running around with machine guns.
[01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:38.520]  He says it's basically martial law in his town. We'll be back. Stay with us. Third hour straight
[01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:44.280]  ahead. I'm going to go to Dave next and then... Thank you for listening to GCN. Dustin and Tanner.
[01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:53.640]  Visit GCNLive.com today. Many of the products at infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[01:58:53.640 --> 01:58:57.800]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription,
[01:58:57.800 --> 01:59:02.920]  but when we look at a product like Survival Shield Mason iodine X2, it's something that really has
[01:59:02.920 --> 01:59:07.560]  been hiding in plain view for over 100 years. The federal government mandated from the 20s
[01:59:07.560 --> 01:59:12.520]  until the 70s that iodine accrued form of it be added to table salt because of the incredible
[01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:16.840]  health problems that dietary deficiency and iodine was causing. I want to challenge the
[01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:21.880]  listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves. What do you have to lose? You are the tip of the spear
[01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:26.520]  in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed
[01:59:26.520 --> 01:59:31.240]  my life and many other people's lives that I know. And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so
[01:59:31.240 --> 01:59:35.800]  hard to keep in stock. We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about
[01:59:35.800 --> 01:59:40.280]  to sell out. It may be a month or two until more comes in. I want to challenge all of you in the
[01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:48.840]  next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:19.080]  You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now live from
[02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:26.200]  Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Joe Scow is the editor of World Affairs Brief. He's going to be joining us.
[02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:34.120]  He's very informed geopolitically. One of the top survivalists in the country. His views
[02:00:34.120 --> 02:00:39.160]  never remind just slightly in interpretation about the three major predator groups. There have been
[02:00:39.160 --> 02:00:43.160]  big developments since he was on with us three months ago. He's coming up the next segment.
[02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:46.840]  We'll continue with your calls. We also have an update from Joe Biggs, the bottom of the hour,
[02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:52.280]  and Jacari and Joe will be down there in the fourth hour when Leanne McAdoo is hosting the fourth hour,
[02:00:52.280 --> 02:00:57.480]  the wrap up show, Overdrive, whatever you want to call it. It's a jam packed fourth hour. Dave
[02:00:57.480 --> 02:01:03.560]  in California, thanks for holding your on the air. Heather Alex, long time no talk to you. Welcome.
[02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:10.520]  Thank you. I echo the previous caller's request for Syrian girl partisan to come on. I'd like to
[02:01:10.520 --> 02:01:19.160]  hear her take and possibly also Mr. Scousen's take on our actual relationship with Israel.
[02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:24.360]  They're not our technically not our ally and they're not a member of NATO. Is that correct?
[02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:30.120]  Well, we have agreements unilaterally with Israel to quote defend Israel,
[02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:33.720]  but you're right. They didn't sign any nuclear treaties, chemical weapons treaties,
[02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:38.680]  UN treaties. I think it's smart. They're like Switzerland. Israel's like no, we'll make our own
[02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:43.320]  laws and people criticize Israel for that. No, I think we should stay out of everything as well.
[02:01:44.440 --> 02:01:51.960]  I agree with that. So technically, you know, Israel could be on their own, you know, it won't
[02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:58.280]  happen, but nobody's going to attack Israel again. They got 800 nuclear weapons at least
[02:01:58.280 --> 02:02:04.200]  with high tech cruise missiles, ICBMs, everything. It's the end of the world if you attack Israel.
[02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:08.120]  But I don't know our government's attacking Russia. Maybe, maybe somebody will attack Israel.
[02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:12.520]  People are so crazy now. Well, maybe you can get Putin on and ask him.
[02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:19.640]  You know, it's funny you say that we've gotten very close to getting Putin on. The problem is
[02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:24.040]  I'd have to get on an airplane and go to Russia to do it. I can get a sit down interview probably
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:29.080]  with Putin. But I mean, he's just going to say what he's going to say. I can sit there and play
[02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:33.080]  clips of him already saying it'd be a nice stunt for me to pull, but I could have did an interview
[02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:38.120]  with Ahmed Denizide. He wanted me to come interview him. I'm not going to say that other people
[02:02:38.120 --> 02:02:43.720]  want me to come interview him. It sounds insane. But anyways, go ahead. Okay, well, that was it.
[02:02:43.720 --> 02:02:47.880]  It's good talking to you again. God bless you, brother. We appreciate you calling in. Let's go
[02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:51.960]  ahead. All I know is I just keep, I got up at six AM this morning and I went and turned on the
[02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:56.280]  computer and I knew they were landing Chinese troops. I knew they were moving Iranian troops.
[02:02:56.280 --> 02:03:01.320]  I knew they'd put 50 migs on the ground and a whole bunch of other helicopters. I mean,
[02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:07.080]  this is a full scale invasion, a counter invasion to the Al Qaeda forces. Then they blew up the
[02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:12.040]  Al Qaeda base. They didn't play games. The Russians have intelligence on the ground. They know exactly
[02:03:12.040 --> 02:03:18.440]  who's pulling the strings and I bet you money. I bet you money. U.S. State Department and CIA
[02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:25.080]  and NATO and Israeli and Saudi Arabian and Turks died today when the Russians blew up
[02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:29.400]  a whole bunch of facilities full of Al Qaeda. I mean, they blew up the Al Qaeda base. They could
[02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:40.040]  just sit there and operate. And that's just incredible. Let's go ahead and talk to Dustin
[02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:46.600]  in California. Go ahead. Hey, Alex. I was just calling because I had a, I got my Hillary for
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:52.360]  prison shirt and I wore it and I went into this neighborhood market called Sprout. This old man
[02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:56.760]  was like, shame on you, shame on you. How could you, how could you want to send a woman to prison?
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:04:03.160]  Oh, see your anti-feminist, exactly. And if you're against abortion or partial
[02:04:03.160 --> 02:04:06.680]  birth abortion, you're now against women according to the head of Planned Parenthood.
[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:10.440]  That's all they've got. They're not intellectuals. Of course, Sprout's is pretty socialist, so what
[02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:15.800]  do you expect? Yeah. Well, that's why I wore the shirt there because I wanted to get some feedback
[02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:19.560]  and see what people would say. And it was just perfect to have someone say that. Like, that's
[02:04:19.560 --> 02:04:23.400]  his argument. Oh, you want to send a woman to prison when it's like... No, yeah. Why don't you
[02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:27.800]  stop picking on a woman, let her commit all the crimes she wants. We're the intellectuals. We
[02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:34.920]  know how to say sexist, racist, homophobe. Three words. We're the boss. Yeah, I just thought I'd
[02:04:34.920 --> 02:04:40.520]  call and say that. God bless your brother. Sorry, go ahead. I just, well, I just got the X2 on my
[02:04:40.520 --> 02:04:45.960]  birthday because that was when you did the $28 broadcast. And man, it's been definitely a game
[02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:50.840]  changer. Well, thank you, brother. Thank you so much for the support. We're going to go to break.
[02:04:50.840 --> 02:04:54.440]  We're going to come back. We've got Joel Scowze in joining us. We'll get to your calls as well.
[02:04:54.440 --> 02:04:56.200]  Joe Biggs is going to pop in. Stay with us.
[02:04:59.160 --> 02:05:03.640]  Just when you think the government couldn't get any more ludicrous, the U.S. Environmental
[02:05:03.640 --> 02:05:09.960]  Protection Agency has taken to social media to point out the harmful effects of sunny days
[02:05:09.960 --> 02:05:15.960]  on plant life. That's right. The agency tweeted, think sunny days are good for plants, not always.
[02:05:15.960 --> 02:05:21.720]  Sunlight causes ozone to form, which harms foliage and weakens trees. Make sure you wonder
[02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:27.320]  how did the planet survive for millennia before a big bloated government came along to protect it.
[02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:32.520]  Let's just point out the absurdity of the EPA highlighting the alleged danger of sunlight as
[02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:37.320]  the world is facing numerous legitimate environmental issues, some of which have been caused by the
[02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:42.520]  agency itself. Let's not forget this is the same agency that polluted the Animas River with more
[02:05:42.520 --> 02:05:48.360]  than three million gallons of toxic waste last month in an effort to cover up that disaster.
[02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:53.800]  EPA officials refused to provide data to the press on the extent of the damage. Read the article.
[02:05:53.800 --> 02:06:01.320]  Obama's EPA warns sunlight dangerous to plants at infowars.com. Introducing secret 12, the new

[02:06:32.200 --> 02:06:36.360]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because
[02:06:36.360 --> 02:06:40.520]  of brain force. There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:06:40.520 --> 02:06:43.960]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:47.320]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree. It doesn't have stimulus, it doesn't have
[02:06:47.320 --> 02:06:52.040]  garbage in it. It has natural things that do it clean. You will find brain force and other
[02:06:52.040 --> 02:06:58.360]  game-changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:07:01.880 --> 02:07:06.840]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true
[02:07:06.840 --> 02:07:12.600]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus. All of our children
[02:07:12.600 --> 02:07:17.880]  are hit with modern mind control. Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:22.600]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily

[02:08:09.240 --> 02:08:14.600]  You let one aunt stand up to us then they all might stand up.
[02:08:14.600 --> 02:08:23.320]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one and if they ever figure that out there goes
[02:08:23.320 --> 02:08:29.800]  our way of life. It's not about food, it's about keeping those ants in line.
[02:08:36.440 --> 02:08:41.640]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:08:41.640 --> 02:08:48.120]  Well they're saying Obama is an idiot and Putin's made him look like a fool in the news.
[02:08:49.800 --> 02:08:55.080]  I have studied modern history, ancient history, I've studied the current players as much as I can
[02:08:55.720 --> 02:09:01.240]  and I would say I'm still just moderately informed because the world is such a deep complex
[02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:08.600]  political system. But I know this, the West has been funding radical Islamists to destabilize
[02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:13.160]  the Middle East and also be blowback in the West so they can take more liberties in the name of
[02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:21.320]  fighting jihad terror. And I know that certainly George Soros brags that he helped destabilize
[02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:26.280]  Ukraine. I know both sides have beefs. Western Ukrainians have been persecuted by the Russians.
[02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:29.960]  The Russians have been persecuted and during World War II back from the Nazis.
[02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:34.040]  So nobody's perfect in all this and I wanted to get Joel Scalzen on because
[02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:40.520]  he's a former Marine Corps officer, fighter bomber pilot, Vietnam so you can speak to the bombing
[02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:46.360]  raids. He has World Affairs brief that's really accurate long term predicting different developments.
[02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:52.360]  He's also one of the top strategic retreat builders in the country. I made a film with him,
[02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:58.200]  strategic relocation, the film that goes with his full color book that has just some of the most
[02:09:58.200 --> 02:10:05.640]  accurate global information about safest countries regions. We sell it in fullwarstore.com. But he
[02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:09.320]  differs a bit and he talks about the three power groups, the Anglo-American establishment,
[02:10:09.320 --> 02:10:13.320]  the Russians and the Chinese. Well, I agree those are the three predator groups. Both countries are
[02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:21.320]  run by very corrupt Machiavellian groups. We also agree the Anglo-American establishment dominates
[02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:26.040]  the New World Order. It's the main group, but it doesn't fully control the other two, but they all
[02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:33.160]  overlap. But the wild card is radical Islam and it predominantly is controlled by British
[02:10:33.160 --> 02:10:38.440]  intelligence, Anglo-American establishment and the Israelis, the Turks and others. And you can
[02:10:38.440 --> 02:10:43.720]  see them all full court press trying to bring down Syria in the proxy war, just like they've been
[02:10:43.720 --> 02:10:52.040]  doing in Ukraine. So I don't see how the two aren't inexorably linked showing that both are a Western
[02:10:52.040 --> 02:10:58.840]  Anglo-American offensive because Skalsen believes that it was a staged take down coup to make it
[02:10:58.840 --> 02:11:03.640]  look illegitimate. So Putin had an excuse to come into Crimea. Well, he already controlled
[02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:08.920]  Crimea in the gas pipeline. So what is the point of that? I'm not disagreeing with Skalsen. I just
[02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:15.640]  don't see the preponderance of proof. I see some proof there. But regardless, Putin didn't try to
[02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:20.280]  take my guns. Putin didn't try to forcibly inoculate me. Putin didn't try to put in transgender
[02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:26.040]  bathrooms. He's doing the opposite in Russia. So whether they've adopted quote conspiracy culture
[02:11:26.040 --> 02:11:31.320]  because it sells with the public because it's it's accurate, or maybe they're being converted. I know
[02:11:31.320 --> 02:11:36.280]  he met with Sholzenitsyn a lot. I don't lionize Putin. I know Sholzenitsyn basically broke a
[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:41.480]  bunch of stuff down to Putin. I know that in the whole Russian hierarchy, a lot of the shows on
[02:11:41.480 --> 02:11:47.320]  TV now sound like this one over there. So there's a lot of weird stuff going on. You add to that,
[02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:54.120]  Russian airstrikes at least 30 against Al-Nazra, which they admit is quoted Al-Qaeda Syrian branch.
[02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:59.880]  That's Reuters today. I just read from Reuters in the article headline Russian warplanes target
[02:11:59.880 --> 02:12:05.320]  insurgents in Syria, but not Islamic State. Well, that's the command and control. Then IS is just
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:10.440]  their field troops setting up a new country, taking part of Syria and Iraq. So there's my
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:15.960]  analysis. There's my breakdown. And I want to hear Joel Skalsen from his view, Chinese troops,
[02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:23.320]  landing tanks, helicopters jets, at least 50 migs, more tanks, more helicopters. Is Russia being
[02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:28.520]  sucked into a new Afghanistan? McCain seemed very pleased. He said, this is a new Afghanistan.
[02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:35.080]  We'll give them missiles now to shoot down the Russian aircraft. Is it a is it a failure by
[02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:40.760]  Obama or is it a globalist triumph? What is the larger plan that could bring in a one world
[02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:46.360]  government out of this? Kissinger claims it's a disaster and is now criticizing Obama. Is that
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:51.480]  a front or what do you think's behind that? I mean, I know I've thrown out 30 or 40 things here,
[02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:57.240]  Joel. This is incredibly complex. So I hope you can give us some perspective here, hopefully,
[02:12:57.880 --> 02:13:03.480]  so that we can try to decipher what's going on. Well, thanks, Alex. It is really complex.
[02:13:03.480 --> 02:13:11.320]  Let me just try to say in general, the important thing for people to realize is that Syria has been
[02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:17.880]  the target of the Anglo-American globalists for about three years now, ever since Israel said,
[02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:23.160]  look, you guys want us to attack Iran, take down their nuclear program and start a Middle East war.
[02:13:23.160 --> 02:13:28.280]  We don't want to do that until you take down Syria, because Syria's got all these missiles and chemical
[02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:34.840]  weapons. They could obliterate Tel Aviv and overwhelm our iron dome system. So the US agreed to that,
[02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:42.360]  and that's why they started this no fly zone proposal as in Libya or Syria. And you know that
[02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:47.880]  that no fly zone meant much more than just a no fly zone. It actually was an offensive that went
[02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:54.120]  through to take down the Libyan military and infrastructure to make sure they lost the war.
[02:13:54.120 --> 02:13:59.560]  That's what they're going to do in Syria. And then Kerry made that faux pas there in the London
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:03.240]  press conference, given when the reporter asked, is there any way that Syria could avoid this?
[02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:07.400]  And he said, yeah, they could give up their chemical weapons. And Syria said, we accept.
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:12.040]  And the Russians said, we accept. And all of a sudden, the globalist agenda to take down Syria
[02:14:12.040 --> 02:14:17.880]  was put on its back. Now, that's why the US and British intelligence created ISIS. They basically
[02:14:17.880 --> 02:14:23.480]  took about half the Syrian rebels that they'd been funding through Qatar and Saudi Arabia and
[02:14:23.480 --> 02:14:29.400]  Bahrain. And they said, you're going to be ISIS now. They set up training camps in Jordan. They
[02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:38.040]  put Israeli special Arab agents in to direct them. And so started this phony war on ISIS.
[02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:43.880]  Basically, a backdoor excuse to get back into Syria, because the chemical weapons agreement
[02:14:43.880 --> 02:14:49.320]  with Syria prohibited US or at least stopped them diplomatically from going forward. So ISIS now
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:58.040]  gave them a noose used to get back. And Russia had to know that this was a US-British intelligence
[02:14:58.040 --> 02:15:03.080]  coup to create ISIS as an excuse. But it's interesting that Russia did not blow the whistle
[02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:08.360]  on that. They still are playing the terrorist card, just like the US did, because that eventually
[02:15:08.360 --> 02:15:16.040]  gives them reasons to go forward against the war on terror. And plus the fact that probably
[02:15:16.040 --> 02:15:21.080]  Americans would not accept the fact that the Russians came out and said this was the US-British
[02:15:21.080 --> 02:15:26.360]  intelligence creation, ISIS. Though Putin in his main statement, you're right, Joel, plays the
[02:15:26.360 --> 02:15:31.880]  whole terror card, but in statements last year at the Olympics and then in his new UN speech,
[02:15:31.880 --> 02:15:36.280]  which we have an accurate translation of, he did go further towards that. He actually said
[02:15:36.280 --> 02:15:45.720]  in the speech at the Olympics a year ago, he said Obama has armed ISIS and they're behind ISIS.
[02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:49.320]  Well, I wasn't aware of that, but that is strange. You notice that the media didn't, of course,
[02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:56.680]  give any play to that. If they had, I doubt that the Americans probably would have believed it
[02:15:56.680 --> 02:16:03.320]  coming from Russia. They're starting to believe it coming from you and me and other credible sources
[02:16:03.320 --> 02:16:09.160]  on the internet documenting that this is a US-British intelligence creation.
[02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:13.240]  What does this new escalation mean? Because I know I interrupted you and broke your train
[02:16:13.240 --> 02:16:17.800]  of thought, but what does this new big escalation by the Russians and the Chinese and the Iranians
[02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:23.800]  mean? Are they walking into a trap? No, they're not walking into a trap. In fact,
[02:16:23.800 --> 02:16:29.640]  this is a major game changer for the globalist agenda in Syria. It stops it dead in its tracks
[02:16:29.640 --> 02:16:35.160]  for a couple of reasons. One, Putin suddenly has the high ground of leadership here. He's going to
[02:16:35.160 --> 02:16:41.240]  show that Obama's war on terror was a fraud. He's going to show that real effective airstrikes are
[02:16:41.240 --> 02:16:46.440]  going to take down ISIS, but you can't take down ISIS without ground troops. Now, that would be a
[02:16:46.440 --> 02:16:52.360]  trap for Russia. They don't want to get involved in another Afghanistan. I have to laugh at John
[02:16:52.360 --> 02:16:58.600]  McCain, the extreme neocon trying to say, we're going to treat Russia's interference here as if
[02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:06.040]  it's the same interference in Afghanistan. It is not. But the ground troops are going to be provided
[02:17:06.040 --> 02:17:12.200]  by not by Chinese. In fact, the stories about a lot of Chinese equipment coming in really have not
[02:17:12.200 --> 02:17:18.600]  been confirmed yet. What has been confirmed is the presence of revolutionary guards from Iran and
[02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:23.880]  Hezbollah troops. They're going to be the shock troops. Russia's going to provide the air power,
[02:17:23.880 --> 02:17:28.680]  and I think they're going to go and take down ISIS. Now, this is going to be a major game changer
[02:17:28.680 --> 02:17:36.040]  because if Syria doesn't get taken down, that means that the entire agenda of taking down Iran,
[02:17:36.040 --> 02:17:40.600]  and as I've explained in your show before, this nuclear agreement with Iran is just a fraud,
[02:17:40.600 --> 02:17:46.840]  is just a setup, including many elements that guarantee that Iran will eventually have to
[02:17:46.840 --> 02:17:51.560]  violate that agreement and give the excuse to go for the U.S. to go back and attack Iran
[02:17:51.560 --> 02:17:59.560]  using Israel. But this puts that whole timetable into limbo. And I think this is a real defeat for
[02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:08.440]  globalists and shows that Russia has the capability of stopping it without a lot of cost to itself.
[02:18:08.440 --> 02:18:10.040]  I'm surprised they didn't do it earlier.
[02:18:10.040 --> 02:18:20.520]  I just marvel at this. So in your view, and I agree with you, Putin is completely gaming
[02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:25.800]  Obama, and so it's really unprecedented to have these op-ed pieces written by Henry Kissinger
[02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:31.320]  criticizing Obama when Obama was first elected. Kissinger took to CNBC to say,
[02:18:32.440 --> 02:18:36.360]  he's my protege. He's the greatest weapon we've ever had for the New World Order.
[02:18:36.360 --> 02:18:42.120]  He's going to bring in the New World Order. I mean, they acted like he was the golden child,
[02:18:42.680 --> 02:18:47.560]  the messiah of world government. And now, what does it signify to have Kissinger
[02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:55.880]  dissing himself from Obama? Well, what it signifies is that he's realizing and admitting
[02:18:55.880 --> 02:19:01.000]  that the globalists are stymied. Now, remember, this is not Obama's plan. Obama is not the genius
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.480]  behind the New World Order. Sure, he's the figurehead, though.
[02:19:03.480 --> 02:19:08.600]  He's the figurehead. He's the frontman. But believe me, I mean, the Russians had let the
[02:19:08.600 --> 02:19:15.000]  U.S. get away with this globalist agenda here in Syria now for many years, and suddenly,
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:19.800]  I think they were caught completely off guard. They didn't think the Russians were going to do
[02:19:19.800 --> 02:19:25.240]  this. They put up a lot of hype about how they're going to make things worse, how there's going to
[02:19:25.240 --> 02:19:31.800]  be military conflict. And now, what the Russians doing and attacking Al-Nusra, as well as other
[02:19:31.800 --> 02:19:38.520]  rebel groups, friendlies, supposedly, to the U.S. agenda, they're going to force the U.S. to say,
[02:19:38.520 --> 02:19:42.440]  all right, we're going to have to coordinate, meaning we want to control where you strike.
[02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:48.360]  And Russia's not going to go along with that. I think Russia is taking direct coordination
[02:19:48.360 --> 02:19:51.960]  from the Syrians and say, these are the targets that are the greatest danger to us.
[02:19:51.960 --> 02:19:55.880]  We need you to go after those. The Russians are doing it. And I don't think the U.S. is going
[02:19:55.880 --> 02:20:00.920]  to be able to stop it. They really don't have any power at all to say to the Russians,
[02:20:00.920 --> 02:20:04.600]  you don't have any right here. In fact, the Russian Lavrov, foreign minister,
[02:20:04.600 --> 02:20:10.920]  made the point that the U.S. intervention in Syria is not authorized by any Security Council
[02:20:10.920 --> 02:20:15.480]  or UN agreement and that the Russians is because they've got the permission of the head of state.
[02:20:16.200 --> 02:20:21.160]  And Putin made a great point in his speech that we need to reestablish governments here to stop
[02:20:21.160 --> 02:20:25.960]  all these refugees from leaving. We need order here. And we're intent on providing order and
[02:20:25.960 --> 02:20:31.800]  you should be providing order in Libya. So he's taken the leadership high ground here to be sure.
[02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:40.040]  This is stunning. What are the larger ramifications? What are the ripple effects of
[02:20:40.040 --> 02:20:44.920]  this in your view, Joel Scowzen, of World Affairs Brief? The larger ramifications is the
[02:20:44.920 --> 02:20:50.760]  globalists have to regroup. And I suspect they're going to use Israel. There are rumors coming out
[02:20:50.760 --> 02:20:57.320]  of Israel now that they're planning an attack on Syria. This could be a game changer for Israel
[02:20:57.320 --> 02:21:03.480]  to go in and start to destabilize on another front. And I'm not sure the Russians want to
[02:21:03.480 --> 02:21:10.920]  tangle with the Israelis. They would certainly have to get a higher class of air force in there
[02:21:10.920 --> 02:21:16.200]  to take on the Israelis. Sure. This is starting to sound like revelations here.
[02:21:16.200 --> 02:21:23.000]  Well, certainly it may be a little early for that apocalyptic ending. But I can tell you that the
[02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:28.040]  globalists are right now meeting as we speak and trying to figure out how do we stop this.
[02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:34.440]  You know, this, this stymies our entire agenda here. But don't the Russians seem particularly
[02:21:34.440 --> 02:21:39.720]  historically slow to move. But once they move, they usually don't back down easily. I mean,
[02:21:39.720 --> 02:21:44.120]  could Israel bite off more than they can chew and not have the American people's support
[02:21:44.120 --> 02:21:50.360]  when they see Russia taking out al-Qaeda? Yes, if Russia certainly is able to really start
[02:21:50.360 --> 02:21:55.160]  to take out this terrorist, I mean, literally they're going to be put in the hero category. Now,
[02:21:55.160 --> 02:22:00.200]  I'm not a fan of Russia. I know that eventually they're attempting to strike the West. But I can't
[02:22:00.200 --> 02:22:06.040]  help but clap my hands and glee that they're thwarting the globalist agenda. And I'm surprised
[02:22:06.040 --> 02:22:11.160]  they didn't do this earlier. They are very cautious because at the same time that they're
[02:22:11.160 --> 02:22:15.000]  building up a great deal of weapons and mass destruction preparing for World War III,
[02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:19.080]  they've decided to throw a monkey wrench in the globalist agenda in the Middle East.
[02:22:19.080 --> 02:22:28.280]  And may I remind you, I have always long maintained that Russia would not stop Syria from
[02:22:28.280 --> 02:22:33.400]  being taken down if the globalists really went after it. But I was wrong. They have here.
[02:22:33.400 --> 02:22:39.400]  But only because they decided it would not lead to a direct confrontation militarily with the West.
[02:22:39.400 --> 02:22:44.680]  They know that the West is in a bad position having created a terrorist group. And they're
[02:22:44.680 --> 02:22:49.960]  stuck. They can't really come out and defend ISIS. They've got to let Russia have their way. So,
[02:22:49.960 --> 02:22:53.800]  it's kind of a different game. It's not really... I agree. Let's give credit where credit's due.
[02:22:53.800 --> 02:22:57.400]  I don't like giving myself this credit or you the credit, Joel or Colonel Shaffer,
[02:22:58.200 --> 02:23:03.320]  the credit and a handful of other folks. In the last five years with Libya and now Syria,
[02:23:03.320 --> 02:23:09.160]  we've laid out exactly what was happening, exactly what happened at Benghazi. I've had major whistleblowers
[02:23:09.160 --> 02:23:15.080]  on. I've now confirmed again yesterday that... I mean, I've directly proven it now that the
[02:23:15.080 --> 02:23:21.000]  feds are crawling all over me. And I was told it's because of Benghazi. I now know what it is.
[02:23:21.560 --> 02:23:27.080]  And it's the fact that we are actively exposing this. The military already knew this,
[02:23:27.080 --> 02:23:31.400]  but it gave them a sounding board three years ago, two and a half years ago,
[02:23:31.400 --> 02:23:36.920]  thousands of non-commissioned officers, some commissioned officers put out the pieces of
[02:23:36.920 --> 02:23:43.480]  paper on Twitter and Facebook saying, I won't be the Air Force for Al Qaeda in Syria. We know that
[02:23:43.480 --> 02:23:47.480]  the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at midnight, the night before airstrikes were to begin,
[02:23:47.480 --> 02:23:52.200]  and the no-fly zone in Syria, General Dempsey then, head of the Joint Chiefs,
[02:23:52.200 --> 02:23:56.520]  Winto Abomin said, you cannot do this. He backed off. That was later admitted.
[02:23:57.240 --> 02:24:01.960]  And the fact that alternative patriot media exposed that we were doing this evil thing in
[02:24:01.960 --> 02:24:09.560]  Syria, our military had a close to rebellion-level event of just free speech. That caused the
[02:24:09.560 --> 02:24:15.720]  globalist to blink. Kerry's screw-ups caused them to blink. And now that gave Russia the chance,
[02:24:16.520 --> 02:24:22.600]  repeating basically domestic info we're putting out in others, to then put the globalist in check
[02:24:23.240 --> 02:24:29.000]  in Syria. And the establishment realizes that this show and others has a direct communication
[02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:32.920]  with the U.S. military, and it's really scaring the establishment right now.
[02:24:34.040 --> 02:24:38.200]  Yeah, we've had a rebellion within the Navy pilot ranks, of which I was a member.
[02:24:39.080 --> 02:24:45.000]  Boy, the story about them trying to get permission to hit high-value targets and them taking an hour,
[02:24:45.720 --> 02:24:49.720]  they were bingo fuel, meaning they got to go back to the ship before they could attack. I mean,
[02:24:49.720 --> 02:24:54.600]  this happened time and again. The Navy pilots realized, hey, this war is being sabotaged just
[02:24:54.600 --> 02:24:59.800]  like it was for us in Vietnam. Go over that a little bit because we know the Iraqi government's
[02:24:59.800 --> 02:25:03.880]  proven others have that our military is not allowed to target ISIS or any of these other
[02:25:03.880 --> 02:25:09.160]  scumbags. And again, that's why we've had the former head of Defense Intelligence go public
[02:25:09.160 --> 02:25:13.480]  and say, no, we were ordered to back al Qaeda. We were ordered to back ISIS. This was a conscious
[02:25:13.480 --> 02:25:18.360]  order. We have the deputy director of the CIA going public two weeks ago. Are they covering
[02:25:18.360 --> 02:25:25.960]  their butts or are they openly rebelling against this tyranny? They're not really opening a rebellion.
[02:25:25.960 --> 02:25:31.400]  You can't do that in the military. The military is ruthless. It's filled with higher level
[02:25:31.400 --> 02:25:36.680]  of yesmanship at the highest level of generals and admirals. They will crucify any officer that
[02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:42.440]  really tries to do a rebellion. But that isn't stopping people from leaking through the alternative
[02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:47.560]  media the stories that we had from Navy pilots saying, you know, they were being sabotaged here
[02:25:47.560 --> 02:25:53.000]  with slow response times. And these other things that you just quoted, this is a leaking war,
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:57.000]  but not an open rebellion. I don't think you're going to see that. It's not possible in today's
[02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:01.560]  yes man military. Well, I agree with you, but I'm saying this is as close as you get to that right
[02:26:01.560 --> 02:26:09.800]  now. Yes, right. It's as good as they can. And it's a leaking war is a very effective war because
[02:26:11.240 --> 02:26:16.520]  the alternative media is big enough. The stories do get out and these people are having to react
[02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:22.280]  to this. So I think the globalists are in a major quandary. Their entire agenda for the Middle East
[02:26:22.280 --> 02:26:29.800]  is on the rocks right now. They're going to have to establish some new way of getting rid of Syria.
[02:26:29.800 --> 02:26:33.560]  And of course, Syria was headed to be a disaster. If you let ISIS take over the hottest, it would
[02:26:33.560 --> 02:26:39.000]  be a bloodbath. It would be forever. I mean, just like Libya, Libya is not stable to this day and
[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:43.000]  there shows no sign of stability. How would our elites, I mean, because I understand China and
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:47.720]  Russia are bad and so you can create arguments to do Machiavellian things for the greater good,
[02:26:47.720 --> 02:26:54.840]  but that always leads into corruption. But such conscious evil to put al-Qaeda, al-Nusra, ISIS
[02:26:54.840 --> 02:27:00.600]  in charge, blowing up every church, chopping people's heads off, murdering families. I mean,
[02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:06.360]  these really are bad people. How did our elite get to the point that they thought they could get away
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:12.120]  with an al-Qaeda proxy army taking over the whole Middle East? I mean, they've got to know the genies
[02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:17.800]  out of the bottle. People now understand that our government's capable of this.
[02:27:19.800 --> 02:27:25.800]  Yes. You know, what's out of the bottle is the fact that you've unleashed on the world a bunch
[02:27:25.800 --> 02:27:31.320]  of jihadists that you've created, you've armed, you've given the propaganda reason you've created
[02:27:31.320 --> 02:27:35.720]  the hatred towards America that gins up all of this, even though America's doing this.
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:41.640]  This can't be put back in the bottle. That's refugee situation in Europe, for example,
[02:27:41.640 --> 02:27:49.240]  is turning into a nightmare of chaos and of riots and of destruction of public property,
[02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:54.920]  which is being very much covered up by the media. And your website, InfoWars, is putting out that
[02:27:54.920 --> 02:27:59.800]  information as well as other people in Europe. World Affairs Brief.com is exposing it.
[02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:05.880]  Yes, that's right. I mean, it's just horrendous. But you know, there's this multicultural agenda
[02:28:05.880 --> 02:28:11.960]  that is on the rocks because people are up in arms in Europe, stop these refugees. And I think
[02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:17.640]  the globalists are at a crucial point as we speak here. Every one of their agendas have backfired.
[02:28:17.640 --> 02:28:24.040]  They've gone overboard. And I hate to say this, but we owe it to Russia from stopping this agenda
[02:28:24.040 --> 02:28:29.240]  right now. Is this probably the biggest unraveling of the globalist agenda we've seen
[02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:36.520]  since Bretton Woods? I mean, is this not one of the just most spectacular spectacles we've ever seen?
[02:28:37.800 --> 02:28:40.600]  Well, Bretton Woods was actually a success. It's what-
[02:28:40.600 --> 02:28:43.800]  No, no, that's what I'm saying. Since the launch of this current system,
[02:28:43.800 --> 02:28:46.360]  is this not one of the most spectacular train wrecks?
[02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:53.160]  It is. And it could even get worse for them if Russia and Hezbollah and Iranian Revolutionary
[02:28:53.160 --> 02:28:58.920]  Guard are able to actually defeat ISIS. I mean, the U.S. will literally be the laughing stock
[02:28:58.920 --> 02:29:04.360]  of the international community. They will no longer be able to say our military intervention is going
[02:29:04.360 --> 02:29:10.200]  to provide the excuse that it has in the past. And that's going to be a real problem for global,
[02:29:10.200 --> 02:29:17.480]  because they depend on continual intervention in order to create conflict and then to dictate
[02:29:17.480 --> 02:29:21.480]  the solution. But now Russia is intervening, so they're dictating the solution. And it's the
[02:29:21.480 --> 02:29:25.960]  correct one. It's going to defeat ISIS. And in the process, you're defeating U.S. and British
[02:29:25.960 --> 02:29:32.200]  intelligence. Unbelievable. So it is a giant train wreck. I agree with Joel Scowsen. He brings
[02:29:32.200 --> 02:29:36.760]  amazing clarity. You'll find more of that clarity at worldaffairsbrief.com. I think you're insane
[02:29:36.760 --> 02:29:40.760]  if you don't visit that site every day. And of course, infowars.com. Joe Biggs is going to
[02:29:40.760 --> 02:29:46.520]  pop in from the Bloomberg anti-gun rally in Austin. Then we'll go back to Joel Scowsen and take your
[02:29:46.520 --> 02:30:02.760]  calls. Stay with us. Have you waited your whole life to become a mother? Well,
[02:30:02.760 --> 02:30:08.120]  you're probably a racist, sexist homophobe. LGBT activists have already convinced the
[02:30:08.120 --> 02:30:13.880]  Midwives Alliance of North America to stop referring to their clients as women and mothers
[02:30:13.880 --> 02:30:20.680]  and instead call them pregnant people and birthing individuals so transsexuals won't get offended.
[02:30:20.680 --> 02:30:26.120]  Numerous midwives have protested this language change, calling it an attack on women. In an open
[02:30:26.120 --> 02:30:31.560]  letter, they say, by embracing the idea that any human other than those in a class called women
[02:30:31.560 --> 02:30:38.440]  can carry offspring to term, give birth to them, and nurse them, we are prioritizing gender identity
[02:30:38.440 --> 02:30:44.600]  over biological reality. Obviously, this ideology contributes to the cultural erasure of women's
[02:30:44.600 --> 02:30:51.000]  unique power to give birth. It is encoded in our female bodies. That's what creates, nourishes,
[02:30:51.000 --> 02:31:08.760]  and births live offspring. For more reports, visit infowars.com.

[02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:06.440]  We got some bad news, folks.
[02:33:06.440 --> 02:33:10.760]  We know it was coming.
[02:33:16.920 --> 02:33:23.480]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.760 --> 02:33:30.600]  Stalin said that one man dies, it's a tragedy, 10,000 dies to statistic.
[02:33:31.400 --> 02:33:34.760]  He knew that. And you can have
[02:33:34.760 --> 02:33:41.960]  all of these hundreds of thousands of people killed by different radical Jihad factions
[02:33:41.960 --> 02:33:48.600]  of the Sunni groups directed out of Saudi Arabia, funded and armed by the West, and they're just
[02:33:48.600 --> 02:34:00.360]  dehumanized. But as the war machine continues turning, it doesn't matter if we have 11,000
[02:34:00.360 --> 02:34:07.400]  gun deaths a year, most of them suicide, the others getting related. What, 167 people on average in
[02:34:07.400 --> 02:34:13.880]  the last decade are killed in mass shootings every year. 167. White-tailed deer kill almost 300 a year,
[02:34:14.520 --> 02:34:19.640]  jumping in front of your car. But they create the perception that gun crimes up,
[02:34:19.640 --> 02:34:24.760]  and the perception that owning a gun causes the problem. Then they advertise gun-free zones
[02:34:24.760 --> 02:34:31.960]  for ISIS to hit or for a mentally ill person to attack. It's an option, like suicide by cop.
[02:34:31.960 --> 02:34:36.280]  The more they do shows about suicide by cop, the more people go, I don't want to kill myself.
[02:34:36.280 --> 02:34:41.080]  I'll go out and pull a gun on cops, and my family will get a settlement. Well, it's happened. 20
[02:34:41.080 --> 02:34:46.520]  injured in shooting at Oregon Community College shooter in custody, official say. We're going to
[02:34:46.520 --> 02:34:50.920]  have Joe Biggs and Jakari Jackson, the rallies over, the anti-gun rally they read at UT trying to
[02:34:50.920 --> 02:34:57.960]  ban guns on campus because the state's passing a law to arm people on campus. And here's another
[02:34:57.960 --> 02:35:03.960]  example. UCC in Oregon has a total gun ban. We should put a story out on this because I looked it
[02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:09.800]  up. Approximately 20 people been injured, 15 dead in a shooting at a community college in Douglas
[02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:14.840]  County, Oregon, according to an official. The injured includes a woman who was shot in the chest,
[02:35:14.840 --> 02:35:19.800]  said Chris Boyce, a Douglas County commissioner. The shooting began within the last 30 minutes
[02:35:19.800 --> 02:35:29.480]  of the UCC College. The shooter is down and in custody. We will continue to update as that unfolds,
[02:35:29.480 --> 02:35:35.960]  KTLA-5. Our prayers go out because, hey, even if it's a very low number of people killed in mass
[02:35:35.960 --> 02:35:41.000]  shootings, despite they advertised to mentally ill people to do it, still one person dies and
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:47.320]  there's a tragedy. If five million children get aborted, it's tragedy, or 55 million aborted,
[02:35:47.320 --> 02:35:54.040]  it's tragedy too. So all lives matter, black lives matter, white lives matter, little kids lives
[02:35:54.040 --> 02:35:58.440]  matter, old people's lives matter, veterans lives matter, police officers lives matter,
[02:35:59.560 --> 02:36:04.440]  Catholics lives matter, Islamic people's lives matter, atheists lives matter.
[02:36:06.760 --> 02:36:11.720]  And this will be used now to come after our guns. We know there's a huge new offensive to get the
[02:36:11.720 --> 02:36:16.920]  guns. And I was just saying earlier today, I hope they don't stage something. Some of these things
[02:36:16.920 --> 02:36:21.800]  are real. A lot of these, like the Aurora shooting, and I don't say this lightly. I don't have time
[02:36:21.800 --> 02:36:27.640]  to go over the evidence. I mean, folks, that was as funny as the $3 bill. You just put somebody on
[02:36:27.640 --> 02:36:32.840]  amnesiac drugs, hop them up, put them in a car for the cops to find them, go in, shoot the people,
[02:36:32.840 --> 02:36:37.480]  and then the Patsy doesn't even know what happened. Sir, hand, sir, hand. The police report in
[02:36:39.160 --> 02:36:44.840]  L.A. on RFK said he didn't shoot them and was drugged. And I've talked to detectives that were
[02:36:44.840 --> 02:36:50.040]  on the case. And it's come out. The CIA was there that day. I'm not going to digress off into that.
[02:36:50.040 --> 02:36:55.800]  It's just, it's very easy to stage this stuff. But there's another form of staging it that's
[02:36:55.800 --> 02:37:00.840]  culturally advertising mass shootings, then makes them a reality.
[02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:07.000]  I'm done talking about that. We'll have Joe Biggs and Jakarta Jackson in studio with Leon,
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:14.920]  Leon Macadoo, Leon Macadoo, Leon Macadoo coming up in the fourth hour of overdrive today.
[02:37:16.360 --> 02:37:22.680]  Joel Scalson of World Affairs Brief.com is our guest. We've got callers loaded from Tanner
[02:37:22.680 --> 02:37:26.520]  to Tom, Steve to Chase to Zach. We'll get to your quick questions or comments. And then,
[02:37:26.520 --> 02:37:30.600]  of course, it's on the same subject. And then Joel Scalson can comment on those or you can
[02:37:30.600 --> 02:37:35.320]  comment on those. But Joel, I've been asking a lot of the questions today. Amazing answers we've
[02:37:35.320 --> 02:37:41.240]  been getting from you. Overall, if the globalists are being handed all these big setbacks, I agree
[02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:47.160]  with you, they tend to double down in their hubris and arrogance. But how do you double down with
[02:37:47.160 --> 02:37:53.640]  other nuclear powers? What if Israel starts striking Russian targets or kills Russians?
[02:37:54.600 --> 02:37:59.320]  You said you don't think the Russians would want to be involved in that. But once committed,
[02:37:59.320 --> 02:38:05.320]  couldn't this escalate really quickly and we wake up and there's a bigger regional war? I mean,
[02:38:05.320 --> 02:38:10.440]  as you know, this is how World War One, World War Two started, is with these incremental ratcheting
[02:38:10.440 --> 02:38:17.160]  up. Am I right to say the world has reached almost a Cuban missile crisis level situation right now?
[02:38:18.600 --> 02:38:25.720]  Not yet, Alex. It's very, very clear that Russia is being very careful. If they really wanted to go
[02:38:25.720 --> 02:38:32.680]  full bore into this, they put their own special forces troops into Syria because they're much,
[02:38:32.680 --> 02:38:40.040]  much better than even Hezbollah and the Revolutionary Guards. So I don't think that they want to risk
[02:38:40.040 --> 02:38:44.280]  because they're not ready for war yet. I mean, as I pointed out many times in the World Affairs
[02:38:44.280 --> 02:38:49.640]  Brief, Russia and China still aren't going to have their top of the line weapon systems in
[02:38:49.640 --> 02:38:57.160]  production until 2021, 22 and 23 and 24. And so it's going to take, I mean, that's the reason
[02:38:57.160 --> 02:39:03.880]  that Putin is doing a stealth war in Ukraine rather than in your face invasion. He's taking back
[02:39:03.880 --> 02:39:10.920]  these former Soviet states a little by little, not enough to antagonize or force the West to
[02:39:10.920 --> 02:39:16.120]  confront him. And I think that's the reason why he's not committed to troops. You know, the Russian
[02:39:16.120 --> 02:39:21.640]  press says we don't want another Afghanistan, but the Russian hierarchy doesn't care about democracy
[02:39:21.640 --> 02:39:27.000]  or what public opinion is. They do what they want to do. And so the reason for not sending troops
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:33.480]  into Syria has to be because they don't want to have a major war provocation with the West or Israel.
[02:39:34.600 --> 02:39:41.560]  But as I say, I pointed out that Israel may well be the spearhead for the
[02:39:41.560 --> 02:39:46.520]  globals to try to get another angle into Syria. Oh, their defense minister said they're going to act.
[02:39:48.600 --> 02:39:53.800]  They just didn't say exactly how. No, that's right. And you know, there's a difference between
[02:39:53.800 --> 02:39:59.880]  what they say and what they do. But clearly the Israelis, I think, are the only card left that
[02:39:59.880 --> 02:40:07.000]  the globalists have to change this situation in Syria. The right now Russia is controlling
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:12.200]  and the US can't do anything. And you'll notice that the US isn't even doing airstrikes right now
[02:40:12.200 --> 02:40:18.280]  because the Russians are in the airspace. And there's a real tremendous conflict there between
[02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:22.920]  airplanes. So the US war on ISIS is basically on hold until they figure out what to do.
[02:40:24.040 --> 02:40:27.720]  But as you said, it was never really a real war. They just blow up an old truck or something.
[02:40:28.440 --> 02:40:33.640]  It was completely staged. That's right. They were always going after little tiny targets,
[02:40:33.640 --> 02:40:38.200]  individuals. Yes, you would kill, but you won't don't. You couldn't get permission to attack
[02:40:38.200 --> 02:40:43.240]  any of the headquarters and Russia just hit some of those headquarters. So they're going to be able
[02:40:43.240 --> 02:40:49.880]  to effectively diminish ISIS very quickly. I think you're going to see the Russian escalation
[02:40:49.880 --> 02:40:55.640]  happen. They're talking about coordinating with the West. I just don't see the West happening
[02:40:56.520 --> 02:41:02.040]  or doing that because the more the West coordinates with Russia, the more they would
[02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:06.520]  have to show their hand that, no, we don't want to hit this particular target. No, you shouldn't
[02:41:06.520 --> 02:41:10.120]  hit this. They're going to be having to tell the Russians not to hit targets that they want to
[02:41:10.120 --> 02:41:13.880]  preserve. And they don't want to get away with that. So I just don't think we're going to see
[02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:19.800]  coordination. I think Russia is going to take the handle. I think ISIS is going to be severely
[02:41:19.800 --> 02:41:26.760]  diminished. And the whole globalist agenda in the Middle East is sunk now, especially since Iran
[02:41:26.760 --> 02:41:32.120]  has got this agreement with the U.S. And they're going to continue to build militarily. And the
[02:41:32.120 --> 02:41:37.880]  U.S. isn't going to be able to touch them. What about Saudi Arabia? They obviously have a huge
[02:41:37.880 --> 02:41:42.600]  weapons platform, but aren't too good, at least historically in wars. Look at what's
[02:41:42.600 --> 02:41:48.440]  happening in Yemen right now. But their government head and a bunch of their top princes, as you
[02:41:48.440 --> 02:41:54.360]  know, came out yesterday and threatened Russia and said, do not enter into this area or we're
[02:41:54.360 --> 02:41:59.000]  going to escalate our military response. They didn't say specifically what they were going to do,
[02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:03.640]  but Russia just responded by massive airstrikes just, just, you know, 12 hours later. So I don't
[02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:09.640]  think Russia is being intimidated by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is a paper tiger militarily. You look
[02:42:09.640 --> 02:42:16.280]  at Yemen. They can't beat this ragtag Yemeni's army with all their airstrikes. And they certainly
[02:42:16.280 --> 02:42:22.280]  can't go up against anybody really trained in air to air combat. The they get, I don't care if they
[02:42:22.280 --> 02:42:26.840]  have F-16s or not, they're going to get shot out of the sky by the Russians. So I think this is just
[02:42:26.840 --> 02:42:33.720]  a paper threat from Saudi Arabia. I think Israel's the only capable military on the globalist side
[02:42:33.720 --> 02:42:40.440]  that could intervene. But it's a, I think even the Israelis would think twice about going up
[02:42:40.440 --> 02:42:50.440]  against the Russians. So this is a mega bold move. Yeah, this is, this is the globalists have stopped
[02:42:50.440 --> 02:42:57.000]  dead in the water and they, they don't know what to do right now because you know, they're, you see,
[02:42:57.560 --> 02:43:02.840]  with the globalist agenda of wanting World War three in order to create the excuse for a new
[02:43:02.840 --> 02:43:08.200]  world order, they cannot however, start it. They can't be looked as the blame of this thing. They've
[02:43:08.200 --> 02:43:13.240]  got to wait for Russia and China to do something. And now they've been caught launching a giant proxy
[02:43:13.240 --> 02:43:17.240]  war, which makes them the villain. I mean, the average American may not know this more and more
[02:43:17.240 --> 02:43:22.520]  do, but worldwide everybody knows this has got to be, this is a devastating propaganda defeat.
[02:43:22.520 --> 02:43:25.400]  I mean, this has got to show the globalists that they're not invincible.
[02:43:27.880 --> 02:43:32.920]  Well, that's right. This, you know, I, I have never seen the globalist defeated until the one
[02:43:32.920 --> 02:43:37.560]  mistake by Kerry on the chemical weapons treatment in Syria and now this, and this is much bigger
[02:43:37.560 --> 02:43:43.640]  because this is Russia actually intervening and directly thwarting the globalists in a very
[02:43:43.640 --> 02:43:49.320]  sophisticated way, hedging their bets and being careful not to intervene too strongly.
[02:43:51.240 --> 02:43:56.360]  And I've just never seen the globalist agenda taken a step back until this last
[02:43:57.080 --> 02:44:01.320]  three years and particularly this last week. What do you expect them to pull now though,
[02:44:02.040 --> 02:44:06.840]  to try to pull a rabbit out of a hat, or will they lie low and just try to recalibrate?
[02:44:06.840 --> 02:44:13.560]  I think they have to let this play its course. You know, there's not much you can do once your
[02:44:14.360 --> 02:44:19.720]  terrorist creation ISIS is now under the Russian gun. I mean, you can't go out and create a new
[02:44:19.720 --> 02:44:24.360]  terrorist force in the same area. Russians can attack that too. I think they have to actually
[02:44:24.920 --> 02:44:29.800]  let it run its course. And that means that ISIS is going down at best. They can work for
[02:44:29.800 --> 02:44:37.960]  a, a compromise replacement of Assad. Putin has said he's, he's open to replacing Assad,
[02:44:37.960 --> 02:44:43.080]  but it has to be a democratic double cross, whoever that guy is. That's right. They'll try
[02:44:43.080 --> 02:44:48.440]  to double cross that. But I don't see any quick solutions the globalists could possibly come up
[02:44:48.440 --> 02:44:53.240]  with that can change the dynamic as long as Russia is there. They're going to have to let
[02:44:53.240 --> 02:45:00.520]  us play its course. ISIS is probably going to go down over time, or it may move into a different
[02:45:00.520 --> 02:45:04.600]  area, but it's not going to go anywhere in Syria with the Russians there.
[02:45:04.600 --> 02:45:10.600]  What about that Western area by Iraq? They're holding part of their IS Kingdom. Do you think the,
[02:45:10.600 --> 02:45:12.440]  the Iraqis will be able to route them out of there?
[02:45:15.720 --> 02:45:19.800]  You know, they could change their base of operations to that Iraqi area.
[02:45:19.800 --> 02:45:26.680]  But, you know, if the Russians are smart, they'll make an alliance with the Kurds to go after those
[02:45:26.680 --> 02:45:36.200]  people too. They won't stop within Syria itself. I think the Russians could make a lot of hay by
[02:45:36.200 --> 02:45:40.920]  teaming up. They're already teaming up with some of the Iraqis. The Iraqis are tired of the U.S.
[02:45:40.920 --> 02:45:45.640]  limiting their ability to attack ISIS. And the Iraqis, of course, know that
[02:45:45.640 --> 02:45:52.440]  they saw a U.S. helicopter resupplying ISIS during the Battle of Mosul. The U.S. Navy was
[02:45:52.440 --> 02:45:57.240]  prohibited from striking. They're paraded down the street after the victory in Mosul.
[02:45:57.240 --> 02:46:04.120]  So, I mean, that's what blew the cover on the U.S. towards its claim that they were fighting ISIS.
[02:46:05.240 --> 02:46:10.760]  I think this is probably going to take another two years to eliminate ISIS, and Russia's going to
[02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:16.920]  grow and stature. The one thing that's still going to bring down, that could bring down Russia
[02:46:16.920 --> 02:46:24.360]  in public esteem is that they continue their stealth war in Ukraine. They may have to pull
[02:46:24.360 --> 02:46:29.560]  back on that in order to take advantage of this leadership advantage that they've gained
[02:46:29.560 --> 02:46:35.320]  in the war on terror. What do you expect the globalists to do to punish people? I mean,
[02:46:35.320 --> 02:46:39.560]  who is the blame in the power structure when you got Kissinger pointing the finger at Obama?
[02:46:39.560 --> 02:46:43.560]  Obviously, when he, this is part of his strategy, James Baker's strategy,
[02:46:44.200 --> 02:46:49.480]  Zbigniew Brzezinski's strategy, the Rockefeller strategy, the Big Think Tank, Pentagon strategy,
[02:46:49.480 --> 02:46:54.680]  the Neocon strategy. I mean, it's all a big consortium that came to these consensus.
[02:46:55.640 --> 02:47:00.680]  So, how do they even reform themselves when they're all about never getting blamed for anything,
[02:47:01.720 --> 02:47:08.440]  temporarily, but also spiritually? Boy, you have some very complex questions you throw at me,
[02:47:08.440 --> 02:47:12.680]  Alex. As you get what I'm saying, how are they going to reform their new order takeover when
[02:47:12.680 --> 02:47:20.280]  it's all about dodging responsibility? Yeah, I think the key is going to be
[02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:27.080]  electing a new team. I think they're basically washing their hands of Obama and the present
[02:47:27.080 --> 02:47:30.440]  team. They're going to reform under the new Republican leadership they're going to give us.
[02:47:31.080 --> 02:47:35.960]  If they can get George Bush elected or some other controlled Republican right now,
[02:47:35.960 --> 02:47:42.200]  you know, this election is in disarray. They promoted Trump in order to discredit his
[02:47:42.200 --> 02:47:47.800]  uncareful remarks about immigration, but the public loved it. They can't stop Trump,
[02:47:47.800 --> 02:47:50.920]  even though they keep saying his poll numbers are going down. They really aren't.
[02:47:52.200 --> 02:47:59.800]  You know, Ben Carson and another uncontrolled candidate is coming up equal with Trump.
[02:47:59.800 --> 02:48:05.320]  I mean, the globalists have got three major defeats now at their hand and they're really
[02:48:05.320 --> 02:48:11.080]  scrambling, but they need a Republican to take the mantle away from Obama to claim we're starting a
[02:48:11.080 --> 02:48:16.760]  new and let the conservatives get on board, but they'll be behind that Republican president
[02:48:16.760 --> 02:48:24.120]  guiding his neocon philosophy just as before. What is your gut also you do deep research?
[02:48:24.120 --> 02:48:29.240]  What is your gut on Trump? What type of person he really is? Because obviously he knows that
[02:48:29.240 --> 02:48:33.960]  the establishment makes him more popular attacking him. That's what I told Rand Paul.
[02:48:33.960 --> 02:48:37.320]  I told Politico. I said, if you Rand Paul, you want to win, you've got to be the underdog.
[02:48:37.320 --> 02:48:40.520]  You've got to be the outsider, not the guy that works with the system. Even though I respect
[02:48:40.520 --> 02:48:46.040]  him like Rand Paul, Trump obviously at a street level knows how to win. My only question is,
[02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.240]  does he work for Trump or does he work for the globalist?
[02:48:51.320 --> 02:48:54.600]  I don't think he works for the globalist, but I don't think he's
[02:48:54.600 --> 02:49:01.960]  principled enough. In fact, I'm sure he's not principled enough that he couldn't be controlled
[02:49:01.960 --> 02:49:06.440]  by the globalist if he were to get in. Now, I personally don't think that he would be good
[02:49:06.440 --> 02:49:11.160]  for the conservatives or the globalists because for one, he won't read a script.
[02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:16.120]  He won't even write his own script and stick to it. He has to speak off the cup. This shows
[02:49:16.120 --> 02:49:22.680]  a person that is very impatient. He's a dramatic go-getter who just doesn't have the patience
[02:49:22.680 --> 02:49:30.200]  to carefully write or describe an argument and stick to it. He's a bull under China closet,
[02:49:30.200 --> 02:49:37.160]  and he would be an embarrassment to the United States just because of the errors that he would
[02:49:37.160 --> 02:49:44.520]  say. But I have to say that Trump is basically right on the immigration policy. He's okay on
[02:49:44.520 --> 02:49:49.960]  certain tax policy. He's a disaster on the Syrian policy, though. He's bought into the argument that
[02:49:49.960 --> 02:49:56.360]  Assad has to go because Assad attacked his people with chemical weapons. Of course, John Kerry came
[02:49:56.360 --> 02:50:03.000]  out with a barrel bomb thing about Assad using barrel bombs on his own people, which is absolutely
[02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:09.960]  false. They only used barrel bombs on the other rebels, not on their own people. But it shows
[02:50:09.960 --> 02:50:15.960]  that the United States has continued to lie about Assad, and unfortunately, Trump did not pick up and
[02:50:15.960 --> 02:50:21.160]  did not do his research on this. I don't know how he can be so right on immigration and the
[02:50:22.200 --> 02:50:25.480]  alien problem and be so arty. Sure. What do you think about his tax plan?
[02:50:28.360 --> 02:50:34.760]  Well, his tax plan, actually, I don't like any of these tax plans because they still do maintain
[02:50:34.760 --> 02:50:39.400]  the IRS. They still do have an income base, even a flat tax. Exactly. You just got to get rid of
[02:50:39.400 --> 02:50:43.000]  the income tax. It's unconstitutional to the communist manifesto. Joel Scow is going to stay

[02:54:00.680 --> 02:54:07.240]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[02:54:07.240 --> 02:54:14.360]  a war on for your mind. Please don't ever forget that they have extreme establishment media lying
[02:54:14.360 --> 02:54:19.960]  about us almost every day on national television or in major papers. And it's because for all my
[02:54:19.960 --> 02:54:24.200]  problems is a teleprompter free. We really care about freedom. We care about America. We care
[02:54:24.200 --> 02:54:29.080]  about you. We care about ourselves. We care about family. We care about life. We care about the
[02:54:29.080 --> 02:54:37.160]  right to self-defense. And we're unifying people around basic survival. The globalist are bad news.
[02:54:37.160 --> 02:54:44.760]  And just like Hitler or just like any other tyrant in history, they get delusional and believe
[02:54:44.760 --> 02:54:52.120]  they're invincible and they might just destroy all of us in the process. So the hubris is starting
[02:54:52.120 --> 02:54:59.880]  to run into some problems. Who knows what they're going to do? But we're going to see a lot of
[02:54:59.880 --> 02:55:05.400]  power grabbing, a lot of bizarre behavior now out of these people because they think they're
[02:55:05.400 --> 02:55:10.120]  invincible and they think if they just double down they're going to be okay. Now is the time for the
[02:55:10.120 --> 02:55:16.120]  maximum effort exposing tyranny, the maximum effort getting prepared, the maximum effort to be
[02:55:16.120 --> 02:55:22.200]  spreading the word and to also go to info wars.com, world affairs brief.com and other sites that tell
[02:55:22.200 --> 02:55:27.320]  the truth and appreciate the fact that that press is there because there's a major western move
[02:55:28.040 --> 02:55:33.960]  to restrict free speech at a bold level I've never seen and that's because the system is desperate.
[02:55:33.960 --> 02:55:38.920]  I want to hit a few final phone calls here with Joel Scalzen but I'm sure you've seen them 120
[02:55:38.920 --> 02:55:43.480]  days in Germany for criticizing the immigrants. University's announcing there's no free speech.
[02:55:44.040 --> 02:55:52.520]  It's almost comical if it wasn't so serious how flaming totalitarian the so-called left is. So right
[02:55:52.520 --> 02:55:58.680]  as they get exposed they seem to be lurching into an even bigger display of arrogance.
[02:55:58.680 --> 02:56:05.880]  Have you seen that or what's your view on it? Yes it's amazing to me how they've talked about
[02:56:05.880 --> 02:56:10.440]  rating people in terms of their reliability of free speech on the internet and banning people
[02:56:10.440 --> 02:56:16.280]  who get a low rating. I mean this is a recipe for disaster. People are up in arms and rebelling
[02:56:16.280 --> 02:56:21.480]  against that kind of restriction. I think once again as you said the globalists are lurching
[02:56:21.480 --> 02:56:27.960]  and scrambling and they're going to make mistakes now. They haven't had a major setback in years
[02:56:27.960 --> 02:56:34.440]  and they've just been able to calculate plan and devise conflict creation without any interference
[02:56:34.440 --> 02:56:41.560]  from anyone. Suddenly it's all breaking down so this may just bias more time and that's important
[02:56:41.560 --> 02:56:47.000]  for people's preparation. The main threat that I keep worrying about is eventual war with Russia
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:54.360]  and China that still is on the docket. It's not real soon. I think we're going to pass through
[02:56:54.360 --> 02:57:00.920]  this time without a major economic collapse that people keep warning about. Historically
[02:57:00.920 --> 02:57:05.320]  major powers are going to collide. All the demographics all the graphs show that.
[02:57:06.280 --> 02:57:11.080]  That's right without question but it is further away than people think because Russia and China
[02:57:11.080 --> 02:57:16.520]  aren't ready yet. But remember when that finally happens you're going to get not only economic
[02:57:16.520 --> 02:57:22.440]  collapse commensurate without an EMP strike no electricity in the grid. If you think you need
[02:57:22.440 --> 02:57:29.720]  preparations boy when war comes it's like nothing else and when it comes our entire civilization
[02:57:29.720 --> 02:57:37.000]  seems or ceases to be like it is and we lose all of our ability to make a living and we go into
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:44.360]  a massive survival mode against total social unrest. So even though I have been decrying
[02:57:44.360 --> 02:57:48.200]  the hypesters you know who keep talking about this coming earlier and martial law coming
[02:57:48.200 --> 02:57:53.640]  earlier when it does come commensurate with war it's going to be so serious that you've got to
[02:57:53.640 --> 02:57:58.760]  be ready and we know it's coming because the elite all over the world but especially here are as you
[02:57:58.760 --> 02:58:05.880]  know huge programs much bigger than the Manhattan Project to harden bunkers to go underground to
[02:58:05.880 --> 02:58:10.600]  create alternative systems. I mean there is a buildup much bigger than the Cold War going on
[02:58:10.600 --> 02:58:15.560]  and accelerated speed they're not doing that for nothing. Absolutely right and they're not doing
[02:58:15.560 --> 02:58:19.960]  this because of terrorism they know that a major nuclear strike is going to fall on the United
[02:58:19.960 --> 02:58:24.600]  States that EMP will be here at some time and that's why they're preparing these huge underground
[02:58:24.600 --> 02:58:31.000]  bunkers that's why XTIA FBI directors and other people are building you know bunkers underneath
[02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:35.960]  their resort homes in in the Colorado Rockies. Stay there back in 70 seconds we're going to jam

[03:00:08.520 --> 03:00:11.640]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:00:16.760 --> 03:00:21.080]  final segment i'm hosting leon macadoo coming up to cover a score of issues
[03:00:21.080 --> 03:00:26.440]  we got loaded phone lines if folks want to hold over they can talk to macadoo she'd love to talk
[03:00:26.440 --> 03:00:31.560]  to you tanner from texas you're on the air speaking with joel scalzen the editor-in-chief
[03:00:31.560 --> 03:00:38.520]  of world affairs brief go ahead uh yeah i had a question uh seems like every time you bring up
[03:00:38.520 --> 03:00:45.320]  9 11 you mentioned that uh that saw all you say is that saudi arabia did 9 11 but i mean not what i
[03:00:45.320 --> 03:00:51.080]  said well i mean over the last six months that's all you say you know you say 9 11 and you say
[03:00:51.080 --> 03:00:56.680]  saudi arabia did 9 11 saudi arabia quarterback 9 11 my thing is you know with all this stuff
[03:00:56.680 --> 03:01:00.760]  with world trade center seven with the bbc you know predicting it and then cutting the
[03:01:00.760 --> 03:01:05.640]  beat off before the bill and could be seen collapsing behind her and hold on just a second
[03:01:05.640 --> 03:01:09.960]  you know i broke all that and popularized that i'm able like five films on it and i said there's
[03:01:09.960 --> 03:01:14.440]  shadowy grips the government that stood down and clearly we're involved we've said that just at
[03:01:14.440 --> 03:01:19.640]  nauseam i'm hammering to get the 28 pages out because if you expose the saudi involvement
[03:01:20.200 --> 03:01:25.800]  then you expose their collaborators so my point is i've declared victory in the fact that those
[03:01:25.800 --> 03:01:30.600]  of us that said it was an inside job were right because if our government knew and stood down
[03:01:30.600 --> 03:01:35.000]  that's just as much as involved as if they loaded bombs in the buildings i want to get joel
[03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:39.400]  scalzen's take on who he thinks is involved i'm not going to debate that i'm covering up 9 11 when
[03:01:39.400 --> 03:01:43.320]  i'm i'm not going to brag folks but i'm the guy that first said it i'm the guy that put my name on
[03:01:43.320 --> 03:01:49.000]  the line lost almost all my affiliates everything exposing it and then people say i'm not exposing
[03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:53.080]  it like people call up and say why don't you talk about the fellow reserve you know being private i
[03:01:53.080 --> 03:01:58.520]  i'm just it's it's ridiculous and i'm not mad at you tanner go ahead you got 30 seconds then joel
[03:01:58.520 --> 03:02:04.280]  scalzen can comment well i can just say that from an outsider's perspective listening to a radio
[03:02:04.280 --> 03:02:08.440]  show it just sounds like somebody's trying to point our military at the world's largest oil reserve
[03:02:08.440 --> 03:02:13.400]  it just doesn't seem like you know like you really believe that the saudi arabia's rigged up the
[03:02:13.400 --> 03:02:18.440]  buildings with t&t and that you really believe they fed the script to the bbc i don't think you
[03:02:18.440 --> 03:02:24.920]  believe any of that uh saudi arabia was heavily involved in 9 11 with a bunch of other western
[03:02:24.920 --> 03:02:31.320]  governments that i've made films and named them it's it's like it's like saying if i was henry
[03:02:31.320 --> 03:02:35.640]  ford i hated ford i don't even know how to respond to you right now i've exposed every
[03:02:35.640 --> 03:02:41.240]  aspect of 9 11 joel scalzen you've been on probably 20 times talking about 9 11 being an inside job
[03:02:41.240 --> 03:02:45.960]  give us your take on what you believe happened on 9 11 from the evidence well from the evidence
[03:02:46.760 --> 03:02:51.400]  only the u.s. government had access to all the elements including the cover up including the
[03:02:51.400 --> 03:02:57.240]  stand down including the low-diam explosives silverstein and all of his relationship the saudi's
[03:02:57.240 --> 03:03:02.920]  were actors in it because i think for example the the named hijackers were not the real hijackers
[03:03:02.920 --> 03:03:08.760]  they were the ones that were cover hijackers for the cia the real ones were trained on
[03:03:09.800 --> 03:03:15.320]  big airliners probably in saudi arabia and that was a connection saudi arabia did cover up
[03:03:15.960 --> 03:03:22.040]  and provide funding for the fake hijackers the named faked hijackers in san diego
[03:03:22.040 --> 03:03:26.600]  and they paid for their and that's what the 28 pages is all about is that relationship between
[03:03:26.600 --> 03:03:32.760]  the san diego yes group and saudi arabia but the reason the government's covering up for it is because
[03:03:32.760 --> 03:03:38.200]  if the saudi's get exposed they're going to say hey look we were just working for the government so
[03:03:38.200 --> 03:03:42.760]  the government is not exposed saudi arabia because of the connection the saudi's had with the
[03:03:42.760 --> 03:03:46.840]  government that's why i love jill scousen he's smart he gets what we're doing here we've exposed
[03:03:46.840 --> 03:03:52.840]  the whole thing we have a break in the case on this we have them by the you know what hairs
[03:03:52.840 --> 03:03:58.520]  that's why i'm so excited and and smart patriots that know the truth about 9 11 the military
[03:03:58.520 --> 03:04:02.520]  want to get this out and it'll bring a whole deal down we're not trying to do this to invade
[03:04:02.520 --> 03:04:06.920]  saudi arabia the globalists aren't going to do that they're fighting to suppress it coming out
[03:04:06.920 --> 03:04:12.120]  we're fighting to get it out i mean just last week we did a show about building seven i did
[03:04:12.120 --> 03:04:19.000]  another video last week on it i mean jill scousen do you think i'm covering up 9 11 not at all in
[03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:24.440]  fact i'm surprised at how often i have to defend you from emails that i get about alex jones being
[03:04:24.440 --> 03:04:29.800]  co until pro and i've told them look i know alex we have talked we've broken bed together this guy
[03:04:29.800 --> 03:04:35.080]  is sincere he's working for the right cause and i'll continue to stand on that well god bless
[03:04:35.080 --> 03:04:38.520]  you my friend it's i mean next it'll be i've worked for the federal reserve but but you know
[03:04:38.520 --> 03:04:44.200]  that's what folks do and uh it's it's very frustrating but it's a complex world out there
[03:04:44.200 --> 03:04:48.280]  i'll take any break in the case on 9 11 jill scousen thank you so much i think this is the best
[03:04:48.280 --> 03:04:53.320]  interview ever exciting news about isis getting their butt handed to him god bless you my friend

[03:05:01.560 --> 03:05:07.960]  ludicrous the us environmental protection agency has taken to social media to point out the harmful
[03:05:07.960 --> 03:05:14.280]  effects of sunny days on plant life that's right the agency tweeted think sunny days are good for
[03:05:14.280 --> 03:05:21.320]  plants not always sunlight causes ozone to form which harms foliage and weakens trees makes you
[03:05:21.320 --> 03:05:26.520]  wonder how did the planet survive for millennia before a big bloated government came along to
[03:05:26.520 --> 03:05:32.280]  protect it let's just point out the absurdity of the epa highlighting the alleged danger of sunlight
[03:05:32.280 --> 03:05:36.680]  as the world is facing numerous legitimate environmental issues some of which have been
[03:05:36.680 --> 03:05:42.200]  caused by the agency itself let's not forget this is the same agency that polluted the animus river
[03:05:42.200 --> 03:05:47.400]  with more than three million gallons of toxic waste last month in an effort to cover up that
[03:05:47.400 --> 03:05:53.160]  disaster epa officials refuse to provide data to the press on the extent of the damage read the

[03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:54.680]  california assemblyman also ran for a california governor and he's going to be coming in to to
[03:08:54.680 --> 03:09:02.360]  talk about sb 277 which of course is that draconian mandatory uh vaccine vaccine bill that a lot of
[03:09:02.360 --> 03:09:07.800]  opponents there in california have really been fighting tirelessly to get this overthrown uh
[03:09:07.800 --> 03:09:13.000]  he's going to give us an update on that as well um but first you know i kind of wanted to wrap up
[03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:18.520]  sort of what we've been talking about here today a lot of these stories some of them seem so far
[03:09:18.520 --> 03:09:24.360]  out of left field uh you know transsexuals wanting you to say birthing individuals you can't call
[03:09:24.360 --> 03:09:30.440]  yourself a mom or a parent or you know that you're pregnant uh things like that they seem so far
[03:09:30.440 --> 03:09:37.560]  out of left field uh but we're starting to see authoritarianism shifting into totalitarian
[03:09:38.200 --> 03:09:44.280]  moves and so i wanted to break that down there's a very um important distinction between the two
[03:09:44.280 --> 03:09:49.640]  so i want to first start with this clip with of ben karson now he's getting a lot of flak in the
[03:09:49.640 --> 03:09:54.760]  media lately he's been speaking out saying some things that aren't very popular to a lot of people
[03:09:54.760 --> 03:10:01.240]  there in the mainstream and on wednesday he was at a campaign event and he said that he believes
[03:10:01.240 --> 03:10:06.600]  a hitler type event could happen here uh he says you know a lot of people believe a situation like
[03:10:06.600 --> 03:10:12.440]  what took place in germany in the 1930s and 40s could never happen in america but he begs to
[03:10:12.440 --> 03:10:16.600]  differ and he said you know if you go back you look at the history of the world tyranny
[03:10:16.600 --> 03:10:22.600]  and despotism and how it starts it has a lot to do with control of thought and control of speech
[03:10:22.600 --> 03:10:27.560]  so let's go ahead and play a portion of what karson had to say in a situation where people
[03:10:27.560 --> 03:10:34.200]  do not express themselves bad things can happen that's the main problem that i have with political
[03:10:34.200 --> 03:10:41.880]  correctness it keeps people from expressing themselves and it's the expression the conversation
[03:10:41.880 --> 03:10:50.440]  that leads to solutions the keeping everybody silent while you change the fabric of the society
[03:10:50.440 --> 03:10:57.400]  is not what america was supposed to be about and that is key keeping everyone's silent while you
[03:10:57.400 --> 03:11:02.600]  change the fabric of society and he goes on to point out that that's exactly what happened with
[03:11:02.600 --> 03:11:07.560]  hitler and he says if people don't speak up for what they believe then other people will change
[03:11:07.560 --> 03:11:14.280]  things without them having a voice hitler changed things there and nobody protested nobody provided
[03:11:14.280 --> 03:11:21.320]  any opposition to him so of course that was very powerful and truthful and honest but you're never
[03:11:21.320 --> 03:11:26.040]  allowed to talk about hitler so of course the reporters there were just like well who are you
[03:11:26.040 --> 03:11:31.240]  calling hitler presently are you saying obama is like hitler and of course he did not allow himself
[03:11:31.240 --> 03:11:38.040]  to be baited into that he just simply went on to say i think that this hitler example is very clear
[03:11:38.040 --> 03:11:44.920]  here now let's talk about what's happening presently and sort of come around full circle to how this is
[03:11:44.920 --> 03:11:52.280]  like germany in the 30s and 40s so we've got this article up on info wars dot com trannies want you
[03:11:52.280 --> 03:11:58.520]  to say birthing individuals instead of pregnant women the phrase pregnant women promotes trans
[03:11:58.520 --> 03:12:04.200]  hatred and this is according to some lgbt activists and they have already convinced the midwives
[03:12:04.200 --> 03:12:10.520]  alliance of north america to stop referring to their clients as women and mothers and instead call
[03:12:10.520 --> 03:12:18.200]  them pregnant people and birthing individuals so that transsexuals won't get offended now i am offended
[03:12:18.840 --> 03:12:23.480]  what is the problem here i want to be a mother i want to you know be pregnant one day and now i'm
[03:12:23.480 --> 03:12:28.760]  going to be offending a very small portion of the population because there's this whole movement
[03:12:28.760 --> 03:12:35.960]  out there to reprimand everyone and say not all women have vaginas you know it's just it's crazy
[03:12:35.960 --> 03:12:42.040]  now so they have numerous midwives of course speaking out against this and calling this an attack
[03:12:42.040 --> 03:12:48.200]  on women they said in an open letter by embracing the idea that any human other than those in a
[03:12:48.200 --> 03:12:54.440]  class called women carry offspring to term give birth to them and nurse them we are prioritizing
[03:12:54.440 --> 03:13:02.360]  gender identity over biological reality and that is a very key thing here because we're seeing a lot
[03:13:02.360 --> 03:13:08.040]  of this now i don't want to offend anyone i try not to offend people you know in my own personal
[03:13:08.040 --> 03:13:16.040]  life but to actually try and shift the whole fabric of society by denying biological reality
[03:13:16.040 --> 03:13:21.800]  and you know that's an issue then we have another another story social justice twitterers
[03:13:21.800 --> 03:13:28.040]  referring to periods as women's issues is transphobic and like i said they're these people
[03:13:28.040 --> 03:13:32.440]  are saying remember not all women have vaginas or periods so you're not allowed to talk about this
[03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:37.400]  and you know that a lot of women were taking to twitter to fight back against trump when he went
[03:13:37.400 --> 03:13:43.720]  on the attack against meghan kelly and then it backfired so once again an attack on women
[03:13:43.720 --> 03:13:49.400]  so you know feminists aren't speaking up about this they're allowing this to to happen going back
[03:13:49.400 --> 03:13:55.560]  to karson curtailing that free speech curtailing the way people think and the way they have always
[03:13:55.560 --> 03:14:02.520]  been taught about gender and all of that now another article up paul joseph watson twitter
[03:14:02.520 --> 03:14:09.320]  characterizes disagreeing with someone's opinion as abusive behavior and he points out that this is
[03:14:09.320 --> 03:14:16.280]  just days after top feminists called on the un to censor the internet over critical tweets so
[03:14:16.280 --> 03:14:23.880]  uh one example of the way twitter allows you to hold other account holders you know responsible or
[03:14:23.880 --> 03:14:31.720]  you can say uh they disagree with my opinion so twitter posts that are offensive disrespectful
[03:14:31.720 --> 03:14:38.040]  or in disagreement with my opinion are warrant censorship now can actually get you banned
[03:14:38.040 --> 03:14:44.440]  from the site it constitutes an act of abuse or harassment and this is exactly what these two
[03:14:44.440 --> 03:14:50.360]  feminists anita sarkeesian and zoe quinn were speaking at uh at the un when they were actively
[03:14:50.360 --> 03:14:56.760]  calling for uh the un to censor the internet for any content that they deemed to be offensive
[03:14:56.760 --> 03:15:03.960]  which included telling someone you suck or calling them a liar or by calling a transgender person
[03:15:03.960 --> 03:15:11.960]  by their original name like calling bruce jenner bruce and not katlyn so that's offensive and you
[03:15:11.960 --> 03:15:16.520]  know so we're already starting to see these people policing thought and because of what
[03:15:16.520 --> 03:15:21.560]  they believe in what they think they are now actively fighting to censor your first amendment
[03:15:21.560 --> 03:15:27.080]  right your first amendment right to free speech i mean we saw it out there today at the protest
[03:15:27.080 --> 03:15:31.800]  that ladies in the pink shirt were filming the two protesters being arrested and they had this huge
[03:15:31.800 --> 03:15:35.880]  smile on their face and they're like yeah we're going to take away your not only your second
[03:15:35.880 --> 03:15:40.680]  amendment right but also your first amendment right because we don't want you to be able to say
[03:15:40.680 --> 03:15:46.920]  anything that we find offensive and gone we're going to tie this all back into this you know
[03:15:47.640 --> 03:15:54.120]  germany in the thirties we've got an article on info wars did you know america now is similar
[03:15:54.120 --> 03:15:59.400]  to 1930s germany and i think that this is a pretty important article it's by illinois mic
[03:16:00.280 --> 03:16:07.000]  and uh he goes on to talk talk about how prior to the adoption of national socialism germany was
[03:16:07.000 --> 03:16:13.640]  essentially a christian nation and it was a very progressive country at the time before the rise of
[03:16:13.640 --> 03:16:17.800]  hitler it was considered the most socially progressive country in europe they had open
[03:16:18.360 --> 03:16:25.080]  homosexuality transgendered persons were all you know just lauded they had the whole cabaret culture
[03:16:25.080 --> 03:16:30.840]  there and uh he said in fact the first recorded male to female gender reassignment surgery occurred
[03:16:30.840 --> 03:16:38.120]  in berlin in 1931 so here's a society much like ours today where what what we would call liberals
[03:16:38.120 --> 03:16:43.400]  today we're sort of advocating for this pushing for this and because it was a christian mostly
[03:16:43.400 --> 03:16:48.520]  christian people they were tolerant and live and let live you do your thing but they they
[03:16:48.520 --> 03:16:54.120]  was kind of this undercurrent where they were feeling like all of this perversion was um eating
[03:16:54.120 --> 03:16:59.480]  away at the fabric of their society and especially when they started pushing it on children so then
[03:16:59.480 --> 03:17:04.920]  all of a sudden they've got this tough talking hitler coming in uh speaking in populous language
[03:17:04.920 --> 03:17:09.720]  about restoring the greatness of germany and knowing that this is exactly what the average
[03:17:09.720 --> 03:17:14.760]  citizen wanted to hear so one of the first actions that they took to return germany to greatness
[03:17:15.320 --> 03:17:21.000]  was the reichstag fire decree which they modified their constitution to allow restrictions on free
[03:17:21.000 --> 03:17:26.600]  speech and personal liberty which is exactly what we're starting to see here then they've had a book
[03:17:26.600 --> 03:17:32.200]  burning where they purged german society of literature of perversion and then of course that
[03:17:32.200 --> 03:17:38.120]  went on to burning all sorts of things that challenged the agenda of the nazi party and
[03:17:38.120 --> 03:17:44.280]  then the roundups began where they started purging first gypsies and perverts but then of course we
[03:17:44.280 --> 03:17:51.640]  know where that all took place and this article issues a pretty important warning as scary as all
[03:17:51.640 --> 03:17:57.160]  that is the rapid and extreme movement in the other direction is what we should be aware of we're
[03:17:57.160 --> 03:18:03.480]  seeing all this being pushed on us presently in this society um but they are sort of setting us up
[03:18:03.480 --> 03:18:09.560]  for a dictator and this illinois mic is saying let's pay attention to you know shifting so far in
[03:18:09.560 --> 03:18:15.560]  the opposite direction one has to ask themselves if for instance the republican tough guy candidate
[03:18:15.560 --> 03:18:21.400]  with populous rhetoric were to be elected and he and his get it done attitude wanted to round up
[03:18:21.400 --> 03:18:27.240]  and deport ethnic and religious minorities like the hispanics and muslims how many people in today's
[03:18:27.240 --> 03:18:33.000]  society would really oppose it and then where would it go from there how could the voice of reason
[03:18:33.000 --> 03:18:41.480]  ever stop it once it starts and so that is a very important warning um and it's basically
[03:18:42.200 --> 03:18:45.400]  you know i'm gonna be getting to this video here in a minute i don't think i'm gonna have
[03:18:45.400 --> 03:18:49.400]  enough time but i wanted to play the beginning of this video what is the difference between
[03:18:49.400 --> 03:18:53.080]  authoritarianism and totalitarianism can we go ahead and roll that
[03:18:55.160 --> 03:19:02.040]  authoritarians merely want obedience while totalitarians whose rule is rooted in an ideology
[03:19:02.040 --> 03:19:08.840]  want obedience and conversion the authoritarians are the guys in charge who want to stay in charge
[03:19:08.840 --> 03:19:14.440]  and they don't much care about you or what you're doing so long as you stay out of their way live
[03:19:14.440 --> 03:19:21.800]  or die it's all saying to the regime totalitarians are a different breed these are the people who
[03:19:21.800 --> 03:19:28.440]  have a plan who think they see the future more clearly than you or who are convinced they grasp
[03:19:28.440 --> 03:19:36.200]  reality in a way that you do not they don't serve themselves they serve history or the people or
[03:19:36.200 --> 03:19:43.480]  the idea or some other ideological totem that justifies their actions they want obedience of course
[03:19:43.480 --> 03:19:50.040]  but even more they want their rule and their belief system to be accepted and self-sustaining
[03:19:50.040 --> 03:19:55.720]  and the only way to achieve that is to create a new society of people who share those beliefs

[03:24:27.320 --> 03:24:32.920]  tom nickels wrote an article the new totalitarians are here and it is a really good one so if you
[03:24:32.920 --> 03:24:37.240]  guys can pull that up on screen i highly suggest people go ahead and read that if you want to know
[03:24:37.240 --> 03:24:41.960]  the real meaning and the difference between those two words because it is very important
[03:24:41.960 --> 03:24:49.160]  now joining me now joe bigs so what do you think i mean are the new totalitarians here you were there
[03:24:49.160 --> 03:24:53.800]  at the protest where people were trying to take away not only that second amendment right but
[03:24:53.800 --> 03:24:58.520]  also people's first amendment rights to protest it was like nazi germany i mean i i've been a
[03:24:58.520 --> 03:25:04.280]  protest so many times this is the first time i've seen it this bad like ut is horrible i mean it is
[03:25:04.280 --> 03:25:09.640]  one of the worst campuses i've ever been to as far as denying people their rights you know for
[03:25:09.640 --> 03:25:14.280]  for crying out loud one of the professors who got up she goes i'm a i'm a feminist i'm a college
[03:25:14.280 --> 03:25:19.800]  professor and we're not here for debate we're here to talk about what we want to now i'm open up to
[03:25:19.800 --> 03:25:24.680]  discussion amongst other ones who are out here you know like minded like me but you know if you
[03:25:24.680 --> 03:25:29.480]  have anything that you know doesn't fit our narrative then we're not going to talk not one
[03:25:30.040 --> 03:25:35.240]  one person one person with a gun-free ut shirt would even speak to me the other one's like
[03:25:36.120 --> 03:25:42.600]  no right i don't want to talk to you about anything you guys are gun nuts you know the entire time
[03:25:42.600 --> 03:25:49.400]  there was someone who was walking around on the stage looking for anti gun or a pro gun signs if
[03:25:49.400 --> 03:25:54.680]  you had a pro gun sign they called the cops and came over you they arrested two people today for
[03:25:54.680 --> 03:26:00.600]  standing there with a sign you don't need a permit you don't need a permit for the first
[03:26:00.600 --> 03:26:06.360]  amendment that is your permit right the first amendment guarantees you that that's the constitution
[03:26:06.360 --> 03:26:11.800]  right well and and i think this article might be from guns.com where they're talking about this
[03:26:11.800 --> 03:26:18.200]  forum on campus carry and there's a picture if you can see on the dot cam the lady the back of her
[03:26:18.200 --> 03:26:23.480]  shirt she's armed with reason and that's their argument is that they're the smart ones they
[03:26:23.480 --> 03:26:29.480]  know everything and people who want to support the second amendment do not know so i guess they're
[03:26:29.480 --> 03:26:34.920]  armed with reason. I wonder how many people in Oregon were armed with reason you got 15 people
[03:26:34.920 --> 03:26:40.360]  dead right now in Oregon maybe 12 they're saying the numbers keep changing 12 to 15 i think 20
[03:26:40.360 --> 03:26:45.640]  people shot all together but that many people dead i mean that's ridiculous think what would happen
[03:26:45.640 --> 03:26:51.800]  if we stopped making our colleges place like this soft targets people think that when we make all
[03:26:51.800 --> 03:26:56.440]  these gun laws that there's not going to be any guns on campus guess what the reason criminals
[03:26:56.440 --> 03:27:01.400]  are criminals is because they don't follow laws they break them right so once everyone's disarmed
[03:27:01.400 --> 03:27:06.760]  guess who will have the guns the police who aren't highly trained some of them are but a lot aren't
[03:27:06.760 --> 03:27:12.280]  and then criminals the argument at the ut campus today was uh we think that only police should
[03:27:12.280 --> 03:27:16.600]  have weapons so i started going well okay because police are highly trained have you ever heard of
[03:27:16.600 --> 03:27:20.680]  kelly thomas they've ever heard about uh sam debose you've heard about these different people who
[03:27:20.680 --> 03:27:26.600]  were killed by highly trained officers who guess what made bad decisions under pressure and did
[03:27:26.600 --> 03:27:31.960]  something wrong well let's be i mean let's be real like the new guys get about six months of training
[03:27:31.960 --> 03:27:37.400]  essentially they get a license to kill i mean that's it so you got six months of training and now
[03:27:37.400 --> 03:27:43.080]  you leave it it took me years to be able to hone the skills that i had to go out there and to to
[03:27:43.080 --> 03:27:48.120]  walk around freely and not feel like i needed to to be like this when i was in combat i mean it takes
[03:27:48.120 --> 03:27:52.280]  time to do that and you give this guy a gun and a badge and you throw him in there and think oh well
[03:27:52.280 --> 03:27:56.120]  automatically he's going to have our best interest in mind he's going to make the right decision that's
[03:27:56.120 --> 03:27:59.720]  not always going to be the case people need to be able to have that right to protect themselves
[03:27:59.720 --> 03:28:04.040]  because when seconds count it takes minutes for police to arrive right by the time those cops showed
[03:28:04.040 --> 03:28:08.920]  up today in oregon what happened there was already a body count that those numbers can dissipate and
[03:28:08.920 --> 03:28:15.560]  go down if you actually have people on campus who can carry and fight that threat or not you know
[03:28:16.200 --> 03:28:20.600]  leaving them as sitting ducks so to speak well people think automatically like well if you bring
[03:28:20.600 --> 03:28:25.080]  the guns on campus then that type of stuff is going to be happening all the time well people think
[03:28:25.080 --> 03:28:30.040]  that if it's open carry on campus campus carry i mean which has already been passed is going to be
[03:28:30.040 --> 03:28:33.400]  you know going to affect next year in august but people think that everyone's going to be running
[03:28:33.400 --> 03:28:37.000]  and gunning like it's going to be the wild west like everyone's like oh look at my gun look at my gun
[03:28:37.000 --> 03:28:40.840]  no it's concealed carry you're not even going to know there are people in the protest today that had
[03:28:40.840 --> 03:28:45.960]  guns on them legally no one even knew no one attacked them and went after them or were and
[03:28:45.960 --> 03:28:52.200]  scared no one even knew they had them they were concealed right and guess what responsible gun owner
[03:28:52.200 --> 03:28:57.000]  in texas you have to be 21 most of the kids i talked to today that were anti-gun guess what they
[03:28:57.000 --> 03:29:01.560]  were 18 to 20 you can't even carry anyway so really your opinion doesn't even matter in this
[03:29:01.560 --> 03:29:05.720]  you're you're taking away the the rights and the ability for someone who would be old enough
[03:29:05.720 --> 03:29:10.360]  and legally able to do it i mean it's ridiculous anyways that we have a law anyways i think anybody
[03:29:10.360 --> 03:29:15.480]  should be able to carry wherever they want but we do have the law so with that in mind you're
[03:29:15.480 --> 03:29:20.280]  taking away from those people's rights there's not that many people who are 21 and up it's out of
[03:29:20.280 --> 03:29:25.000]  control that they want to deny that one in five women are raped where are those people at they
[03:29:25.000 --> 03:29:29.400]  care about that let those women protect themselves right and we'll be interested to see what happens
[03:29:29.400 --> 03:29:35.480]  with the uh two guys out there that were arrested i guess two protesters well awesome so i guess you're
[03:29:35.480 --> 03:29:40.360]  going to be coming back in uh kid later in the show kit daniels give us his rundown on exactly
[03:29:40.360 --> 03:29:47.400]  what went on out there at the anti-campus carry rally of course no one once again wanted to talk to
[03:29:47.400 --> 03:29:55.240]  you we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:29:59.880 --> 03:30:05.160]  have you waited your whole life to become a mother well you're probably a racist sexist
[03:30:05.160 --> 03:30:11.000]  homophobe lgbt activists have already convinced the midwives alliance of north america to stop
[03:30:11.000 --> 03:30:17.160]  referring to their clients as women and mothers and instead call them pregnant people and birthing
[03:30:17.160 --> 03:30:23.160]  individuals so transsexuals won't get offended numerous midwives have protested this language
[03:30:23.160 --> 03:30:28.840]  change calling it an attack on women in an open letter they say by embracing the idea that any
[03:30:28.840 --> 03:30:34.840]  human other than those in a class called women can carry offspring to term give birth to them and
[03:30:34.840 --> 03:30:41.960]  nurse them we are prioritizing gender identity over biological reality obviously this ideology
[03:30:41.960 --> 03:30:47.800]  contributes to the cultural erasure of women's unique power to give birth it is encoded in our
[03:30:47.800 --> 03:30:54.920]  female bodies that's what creates nourishes and births live offspring for more reports visit info

[03:33:30.360 --> 03:33:38.360]  bill it says that parents are no longer allowed to have personal belief exemptions children if they
[03:33:38.360 --> 03:33:43.000]  got to go to public school even some private schools there they must be vaccinated the only
[03:33:43.000 --> 03:33:47.720]  way to not have to vaccinate your child is to keep them out of school entirely you have to
[03:33:47.720 --> 03:33:53.960]  homeschool them now in california so tim donnelly is a politician he is a republican member of the
[03:33:53.960 --> 03:34:00.680]  california state assembly in 2010 he was reelected in 2012 donnelly was also a candidate for the
[03:34:00.680 --> 03:34:08.280]  california for california governor in 2014 he placed third in that open primary um he's also
[03:34:08.280 --> 03:34:15.480]  a radio talk show host on radio free california and it's the tim donnelly show dot com so welcome
[03:34:15.480 --> 03:34:21.960]  mr donnelly to the show now what's going on with sp 277 i know that there was a massive push to get
[03:34:21.960 --> 03:34:30.840]  some signatures um to oppose this bill yes that that is correct and thank you for having me on
[03:34:31.640 --> 03:34:39.560]  we we've been working tirelessly when i say we myself and uh thousands of californians who are
[03:34:39.560 --> 03:34:47.480]  concerned about this egregious assault on not just parents rights but natural rights human rights
[03:34:48.440 --> 03:34:52.520]  right to the side what you inject in your own body or your child's body
[03:34:54.040 --> 03:35:03.160]  and in that time frame we we have educated an incredible number of people and created a
[03:35:03.160 --> 03:35:12.040]  grassroots movement that is hitting full stride now the the signature gatherings over the signatures
[03:35:12.040 --> 03:35:19.560]  have been turned into the uh registrar of voters and all all of the 58 counties in california
[03:35:20.200 --> 03:35:26.760]  and we are waiting for their final tally on them okay so the final tally hasn't come in i know that
[03:35:26.760 --> 03:35:31.720]  there was a little bit of discrepancy there the la times was reporting that it's over it's done
[03:35:31.720 --> 03:35:36.840]  there weren't enough votes uh some people are saying you know was there a little bit of sabotage
[03:35:36.840 --> 03:35:41.240]  involved a thousands of signatures are missing so there's a little bit of a discrepancy there
[03:35:41.240 --> 03:35:46.680]  with these votes and as well i know you talked about facing some strong opposition from the
[03:35:46.680 --> 03:35:53.880]  pharmaceutical lobby as well well we we certainly have seen a tremendous amount of opposition and
[03:35:53.880 --> 03:36:00.520]  we've even experienced it undermining within within the movement itself individuals who purported
[03:36:00.520 --> 03:36:08.840]  to be in favor of our viewpoint uh you know wound up undermining much of what we were doing
[03:36:09.640 --> 03:36:17.160]  and i've never really seen it this strong and i think it has to do with the amount of money
[03:36:17.160 --> 03:36:23.320]  that's involved you're talking um hundreds of billions of dollars when it comes to the
[03:36:23.320 --> 03:36:30.680]  pharmaceutical industry it leads to the united states right yeah and we have actually seen
[03:36:31.240 --> 03:36:36.360]  a lot of the pharmaceutical lobby there behind uh some of the people responsible for getting sb
[03:36:36.360 --> 03:36:44.120]  277 passed so obviously a lot of money propping those sort of people up as well now i know you're
[03:36:44.120 --> 03:36:50.040]  saying that your voices have been heard and you're not going anywhere um so what what can people do
[03:36:50.040 --> 03:36:56.520]  from here if this is if there aren't enough votes at this point well if there's not enough signatures
[03:36:56.520 --> 03:37:01.720]  then obviously it won't qualify for the ballot and then that'll be a massive disappointment to
[03:37:02.440 --> 03:37:06.760]  all of those who were hopeful that that it would that it would ultimately qualify
[03:37:07.960 --> 03:37:14.760]  but look the the fight doesn't end the the next step would naturally be lawsuits because
[03:37:14.760 --> 03:37:23.000]  when you look at what sb 277 does it dangles it actually holds your your child's educational
[03:37:23.000 --> 03:37:29.640]  future hostage it kicks your child out of every public setting for education be it public school
[03:37:30.200 --> 03:37:38.840]  private school uh charter schools or even daycare and and and in some homeschooling environment
[03:37:38.840 --> 03:37:44.680]  where the homeschoolers uh association has a relationship with the public school to come in
[03:37:44.680 --> 03:37:49.560]  and and or i'm sorry with a charter school to come in and do some sort of a public activity that
[03:37:49.560 --> 03:37:55.560]  involves hanging around with other kids your kid would be would be ostracized and and forbidden to
[03:37:55.560 --> 03:38:01.320]  attend that and what's their crime maybe missing one single booster shot right that's literally
[03:38:01.320 --> 03:38:07.640]  what we're doing here and and the government is forcing coercing and intimidating parents
[03:38:07.640 --> 03:38:13.640]  in the going against their own personal beliefs or religious beliefs or their conscience
[03:38:15.080 --> 03:38:20.840]  and they're doing it in the name of a health crisis that doesn't exist right well i mean
[03:38:20.840 --> 03:38:27.000]  they're they're basically saying that their vaccinated children are getting sick by unvaccinated
[03:38:27.000 --> 03:38:31.560]  children which then why are you even getting vaccines if they're clearly not working their
[03:38:31.560 --> 03:38:37.720]  whole argument doesn't even make sense so what are you go ahead when you when you start to ask people
[03:38:37.720 --> 03:38:45.480]  questions like that they get really mad they do it's kind of funny so so you you take the cdc's
[03:38:45.480 --> 03:38:52.840]  own report on the so-called measles outbreak at disneyland the cdc claims that they wiped out measles
[03:38:52.840 --> 03:39:01.240]  back in 2000 or 2003 there hasn't been a death since 2003 and yet this little measles outbreak
[03:39:01.240 --> 03:39:10.120]  at disneyland which happened in 2014 was used as an excuse to target escape code those who have
[03:39:10.120 --> 03:39:14.920]  chosen to either not vaccinate or selectively vaccinate their children and they represent a
[03:39:14.920 --> 03:39:21.400]  very very small part of the population they tend to be much more knowledgeable about their health
[03:39:21.400 --> 03:39:28.440]  and and health care issues in general and what's fascinating is when you read the cdc's website
[03:39:28.440 --> 03:39:37.240]  they've identified the original patient as most likely being a form visitor to the u.s so someone
[03:39:37.240 --> 03:39:41.960]  came here and reintroduced measles in the united states and they've gone after a completely different
[03:39:41.960 --> 03:39:47.320]  group of people even though when you look at the rest of the results and and the information on
[03:39:47.320 --> 03:39:52.600]  their website people who were vaccinated and people who were not vaccinated and people whose
[03:39:52.600 --> 03:40:01.080]  vaccination status were unknown contracted and spread the disease equally right and something
[03:40:01.080 --> 03:40:06.440]  i did a a report on this i guess i forget the the young guy's name that they were kind of parading
[03:40:06.440 --> 03:40:13.800]  around and he was sort of the poster child for this sp277 he was getting a chemo treatments and
[03:40:13.800 --> 03:40:19.320]  basically saying don't bring your unvaccinated kid to school and make someone like me that's you
[03:40:19.320 --> 03:40:26.600]  know has a failing immune system susceptible to those viruses when if you go to the john hopkins
[03:40:26.600 --> 03:40:32.840]  site or another one of these children's hospitals it specifically used to say right before they were
[03:40:32.840 --> 03:40:40.680]  trying to pass sp277 to avoid contact with the recently vaccinated that it was those recently
[03:40:40.680 --> 03:40:45.720]  vaccinated children that were actually going to be the more dangerous ones that could possibly pass
[03:40:45.720 --> 03:40:52.760]  along a virus and they changed that manual that they would give to people receiving cancer treatment
[03:40:52.760 --> 03:41:00.520]  to fit this ideology here with sp277 which i that doesn't surprise me i mean that was fascinating
[03:41:01.240 --> 03:41:06.520]  they're they're they're when when the powers that be decide they want to push a narrative
[03:41:06.520 --> 03:41:13.880]  when they have the media compliant and they have terrified the media into not reporting on anything
[03:41:13.880 --> 03:41:19.880]  to do with vaccine side effect right so the the buzzword is safe and effective even though the
[03:41:19.880 --> 03:41:28.520]  supreme court has said that they're they're unavoidably unsafe and the vaccine uh injury
[03:41:28.520 --> 03:41:34.360]  compensation fund that is actually run by the government funded by your tax dollars and my
[03:41:34.360 --> 03:41:40.840]  tax dollars has paid out over three billion dollars in injuries for a product that's supposed to be
[03:41:40.840 --> 03:41:47.720]  safe and effective so obviously some things were wrong and and and when you when you start to ask
[03:41:47.720 --> 03:41:57.960]  questions it it's it's funny people who don't trust the government on anything else all of a sudden
[03:41:57.960 --> 03:42:04.440]  with the sacred cow of vaccinations they become mind-numb zombies and it's like oh the government
[03:42:04.440 --> 03:42:10.440]  knows all the government is we we must trust the government we must public health right
[03:42:10.440 --> 03:42:17.800]  when it when in fact the government has been found recently to have been bearing and shredding
[03:42:17.800 --> 03:42:25.000]  and destroying evidence of causal links between the the mercury based preservative thimerosal
[03:42:25.000 --> 03:42:34.360]  and autism and autism like uh uh side effects and and and yet the media just blacks it out
[03:42:34.360 --> 03:42:42.040]  and ignores it right and and that right there is a much greater threat to our health and then
[03:42:42.040 --> 03:42:47.800]  any of these diseases yeah absolutely and you're not allowed to think anything other than what
[03:42:47.800 --> 03:42:53.400]  science tells us even though we've got reports where they're admittedly using junk science
[03:42:54.680 --> 03:43:00.680]  to prop up these huge corporations like coca-cola for instance was just found to be used paid
[03:43:00.680 --> 03:43:06.440]  the bought and paid for scientists who would find the results that would favor their company
[03:43:06.440 --> 03:43:10.680]  what's going on there in california i mean they are really occupied territory
[03:43:11.800 --> 03:43:19.400]  just uh i guess in 2013 adana writer said he first became aware of you after that case where
[03:43:19.400 --> 03:43:26.760]  a child was abducted by cps after the parents dared to seek a second opinion the parents were
[03:43:26.760 --> 03:43:32.440]  there in the hospital and they were concerned with the care they were receiving um for their child
[03:43:32.440 --> 03:43:37.480]  after a nurse failed to properly address why the child was being given antibiotics so the
[03:43:37.480 --> 03:43:43.000]  parents wanted to maybe go get a second opinion and cps snatched him from their home so i mean
[03:43:43.000 --> 03:43:49.000]  yeah well and it was fascinating because the mother the only thing she was guilty of is
[03:43:49.000 --> 03:43:53.800]  loving her child too much she had a mother's instinct that she was going to be handed back
[03:43:53.800 --> 03:43:59.320]  a dead baby because they wanted to do open heart surgery on him today and she wasn't even comfortable
[03:43:59.320 --> 03:44:03.400]  with the fact they'd administered antibiotics without consulting her and getting her consent
[03:44:04.680 --> 03:44:10.120]  her son who was about six months old who had who did have a congenital heart defect that was
[03:44:10.120 --> 03:44:15.880]  going to require surgery at some point but he was running a fever and she didn't want him going
[03:44:15.880 --> 03:44:21.560]  in for surgery when he didn't have the best chance of survival so she just she just wanted
[03:44:21.560 --> 03:44:28.360]  to protective mode grabbed her child left and they threatened her to send cps they said you can leave
[03:44:28.360 --> 03:44:33.480]  but your child can't and she said you know the heck with you guys and walked out the door
[03:44:34.440 --> 03:44:39.000]  well she went to another hospital she didn't go you know shoot up intravenous drugs she didn't go
[03:44:39.000 --> 03:44:44.520]  to a bar and get drunk she went to a hospital she got a referral for surgery within the next three
[03:44:44.520 --> 03:44:51.320]  weeks and they sent a cop after her the cop showed up and said hey no crime here for crying
[03:44:51.320 --> 03:44:57.000]  out loud the woman's done everything she's supposed to you know go pound sand right well the doctors
[03:44:57.000 --> 03:45:05.320]  in the hospital didn't like being questioned so they they sent cps to her home the next day and
[03:45:05.320 --> 03:45:10.840]  this is a woman who immigrated to this country from germany and her husband came from russia so
[03:45:10.840 --> 03:45:16.120]  both of them come from places where the government you know a knock on the door often means people
[03:45:16.120 --> 03:45:21.000]  disappear and and there was a pounding at the door there were five police officers and
[03:45:21.000 --> 03:45:25.560]  she asked to see the warrant and they they said no we won't show it to you until you open the door
[03:45:25.560 --> 03:45:30.840]  but she refused to open the door so she went upstairs she called her husband and she was coming
[03:45:30.840 --> 03:45:37.240]  home from work they tackled him in the in the in the walkway on the porch took the keys out of his
[03:45:37.240 --> 03:45:44.760]  pocket and broke into her home and it's all legal because cps you know yeah they they're all knowing
[03:45:44.760 --> 03:45:50.600]  right your kids belong to the state she was smart enough to put a video camera on a on a on a
[03:45:50.600 --> 03:45:58.040]  tripod and you can watch five cops walk in hands on their guns like they're going to encounter some
[03:45:58.040 --> 03:46:05.720]  some you know major resistance from this tiny petite little woman and all she's doing is holding
[03:46:05.720 --> 03:46:13.000]  her child and they proceed to berate her and and never show her any and never give her any time to
[03:46:13.000 --> 03:46:17.160]  read any of the documentation and eventually they just threaten her and say look if you don't give us
[03:46:17.160 --> 03:46:20.840]  the child we're going to grab him out of your hands and and you're going to go to jail for
[03:46:20.840 --> 03:46:26.760]  her for resisting arrest or for resisting and and ultimately they she handed over her child
[03:46:26.760 --> 03:46:31.240]  and then she begged to know where he was going and the social worker turned around stuck her
[03:46:31.240 --> 03:46:36.440]  finger in her face and said you don't get to know because you're acting irrational wow and then the
[03:46:36.440 --> 03:46:41.160]  and then the government took the child back to the exact same hospital the parents had lost confidence
[03:46:41.160 --> 03:46:45.880]  that wow and that is so incredible i mean the right to choose what's best for your children
[03:46:45.880 --> 03:46:50.600]  is at risk here we're seeing this not only with this case but of course these mandatory force
[03:46:50.600 --> 03:46:55.720]  vaccinations uh tim donnelly thank you so much for joining us now where can people go for more
[03:46:55.720 --> 03:47:00.600]  information because i know you're going to be uh staying abreast of this giving people kind of
[03:47:00.600 --> 03:47:10.600]  breaking news on this topic sure they can find us at sp277 referendum on facebook they can also
[03:47:10.600 --> 03:47:16.760]  just come to my page tim donnelly or timdonnellyshow.com uh we'll have information all those places
[03:47:16.760 --> 03:47:21.320]  and you can reach out and i want to thank you for having me on thank you for covering this
[03:47:21.320 --> 03:47:26.920]  important issue because the bottom line is this is not about vaccination it's about government
[03:47:26.920 --> 03:47:33.720]  control coercion and intimidation and the stripping away of a basic fundamental freedom
[03:47:33.720 --> 03:47:41.000]  that is guaranteed and is supposed to be protected by the government not put at risk absolutely
[03:47:41.000 --> 03:47:47.160]  thank you so much and that is the point if people don't speak up now when you start to see this
[03:47:47.160 --> 03:47:53.080]  totalitarian hand coming down on you that boot on your neck then who is going to speak out when
[03:47:53.080 --> 03:47:58.280]  it gets you know when it takes an aggressive turn and it really is sort of ramping up wow
[03:47:58.280 --> 03:48:02.440]  tim donnelly well hopefully we'll be able to get him back on for the nightly news update us on this
[03:48:02.440 --> 03:48:09.960]  sp277 now shifting gears here info wars has an article up here media caught distorting president
[03:48:09.960 --> 03:48:15.800]  putin's speech info wars we went ahead and analyzed the translation of the speech and of course
[03:48:15.800 --> 03:48:21.000]  revealed some crucial information i'm going to play a little snippet of this video uh for you
[03:48:21.000 --> 03:48:26.520]  right now so you can kind of get the gist of just what was distorted in the president uh putin's speech
[03:48:26.520 --> 03:48:33.880]  hi there my name is daria and i have recently started working here at info wars dot com a
[03:48:33.880 --> 03:48:40.920]  little bit about me i came to the united states from russia uh when i was a teenager so i speak
[03:48:40.920 --> 03:48:46.680]  russian pretty well pretty fluently so today on the show alex played a clip from putin's
[03:48:46.680 --> 03:48:52.760]  u n speech and i noticed some of the discrepancies in the translation and as we all know mainstream
[03:48:52.760 --> 03:48:58.760]  media tends to manipulate the messages of foreign leaders when they speak so i really wanted to
[03:48:58.760 --> 03:49:05.240]  get down to it and really take a listen and see if there were any manipulations um that happened
[03:49:05.240 --> 03:49:11.560]  so let's take a look it seems however that fought from learning from others mistakes
[03:49:11.560 --> 03:49:17.240]  everyone just keeps repeating them so the start of this sentence may be a little bit confusing
[03:49:17.240 --> 03:49:25.160]  because we're missing the previous passage uh in which putin talks about how in the past
[03:49:25.160 --> 03:49:32.760]  meddling in other countries affairs has not led to any progress but instead to destruction of that
[03:49:32.760 --> 03:49:37.320]  country okay now i'm gonna go ahead and bring that report down now that is one of our new
[03:49:37.320 --> 03:49:43.000]  employees daria and she was uh analyzing the translation of this speech you can go to the site
[03:49:43.000 --> 03:49:49.000]  um the article is media caught distorting president putin's speech and the video itself
[03:49:49.000 --> 03:49:54.760]  in its entirety deceptive translation of putin revealed and that of course is on the alex
[03:49:54.760 --> 03:49:59.880]  jones channel joining me in studio now is our writer kit daniels now kit you're gonna stay
[03:49:59.880 --> 03:50:06.280]  with me through this uh next break but tell me what what went on today at this protest well i
[03:50:06.280 --> 03:50:11.080]  think the whole gun control movement especially at ut austin it's a good microcosm of how the
[03:50:11.080 --> 03:50:16.840]  establishment is using uh mass media to control the population through manufactured consent
[03:50:17.560 --> 03:50:21.480]  i mean the gun rights supporters that were there none of them were in any sort of a movement
[03:50:21.480 --> 03:50:25.640]  they were just kind of guys that are you know construction workers or guys that work you know
[03:50:25.640 --> 03:50:31.400]  auto mechanics they just show up there to support their basic freedoms or basic rights how dare they
[03:50:31.400 --> 03:50:36.360]  yeah how dare they so let's talk a little bit more about that on this other side of the break
[03:50:36.360 --> 03:50:41.880]  no and that's the thing is now is the time to be speaking up they are trying to drop the hammer
[03:50:41.880 --> 03:50:47.320]  so you've got to get out to these protests and speak up fight for your rights my goodness
[03:50:49.080 --> 03:50:52.920]  yeah if you don't speak up no one else is going to absolutely no one will be around to oppose it

[03:54:15.320 --> 03:54:21.480]  kit daniels and jacari jackson now jacari you saw what was going on there at the protest at ut and
[03:54:21.480 --> 03:54:27.000]  you were like i got to get out there now what was it that spurred you to head out well you know i'm
[03:54:27.000 --> 03:54:31.000]  doing the nightly news coming up we'll be talking about this and a whole lot more talking about some
[03:54:31.000 --> 03:54:36.040]  russia stuff as well but you know i've been to numerous of these events i've seen people arrested
[03:54:36.040 --> 03:54:41.000]  for carrying real guns i've seen people arrested for carrying toy guns this is the first time i ever
[03:54:41.000 --> 03:54:45.640]  saw somebody arrested for holding a sign which goes way beyond the second amendment and actually
[03:54:45.640 --> 03:54:51.640]  makes it a first amendment issue to say that at a public university that you need a permit to stand
[03:54:51.640 --> 03:54:57.720]  with a sign in a designated space it's completely ridiculous in a uh downright overreach by the
[03:54:57.720 --> 03:55:02.840]  authority or like i like i told a campus official there is like okay if you want to have if you
[03:55:02.840 --> 03:55:06.760]  want me to go get a permit that's fine but how about i stop paying property taxes for this public
[03:55:06.760 --> 03:55:11.240]  university i had one student tell me oh well this is my tuition is paying for us like your tuition is
[03:55:11.240 --> 03:55:16.520]  not paying the whole way this european subsidized by taxpayers i mean there was a campus official
[03:55:16.520 --> 03:55:20.760]  there in a suit and tie who's on stage going around looking at people's signs if you had an
[03:55:20.760 --> 03:55:25.800]  anti-gun sign he let you stay but if you had a pro-gun sign like tom jefferson did who got arrested
[03:55:25.800 --> 03:55:29.880]  called the cops on you and like i was saying before the break you know the gun rights supporters
[03:55:29.880 --> 03:55:33.160]  there were not part any sort of movement they were just individuals that were trying to protect
[03:55:33.160 --> 03:55:39.320]  their liberties whereas you got this big gun control group that are uh bankrolled by george
[03:55:39.320 --> 03:55:45.480]  soros michael bloomberg from billions of dollars and it's basically you got these this gun control
[03:55:45.480 --> 03:55:50.760]  movements are top down they're getting orders from soros bloomberg and all these politicians and
[03:55:50.760 --> 03:55:56.040]  globalists internationalists whereas the people that are fighting for your second amendment rights
[03:55:56.040 --> 03:56:00.680]  and all your rights all your bill of rights these are people that are just fighting for themselves
[03:56:00.680 --> 03:56:06.360]  they don't their only dog in the fight is their individual rights they understand that they need
[03:56:06.360 --> 03:56:10.280]  protection because just like what do they do if you need help they pick up the phone they call
[03:56:10.280 --> 03:56:13.720]  the cops so why they call the cops and not the fire department because the fire department
[03:56:13.720 --> 03:56:17.480]  doesn't have guns they want somebody to show up with a gun they don't want the ambulance driver
[03:56:17.480 --> 03:56:23.080]  they want the cop to come up with a firearm and squash the situation so when people have the
[03:56:23.080 --> 03:56:27.880]  ability to defend themselves they don't have to be as dependent on law enforcement it's not knocking
[03:56:27.880 --> 03:56:32.680]  law enforcement it's just saying these people have a desire to be self-sufficient we they all
[03:56:32.680 --> 03:56:36.760]  the time they talk about campus rape campus rape well hell if the girls were packing you know we're
[03:56:36.760 --> 03:56:41.800]  packing a roscoe in their purse they probably wouldn't have this uh epidemic of campus rape
[03:56:41.800 --> 03:56:45.880]  going around on these college campuses well they don't want women to be able to protect themselves
[03:56:45.880 --> 03:56:52.120]  though yeah i was like this uh i was i was talking this one uh kind of this gun control advocate
[03:56:52.120 --> 03:56:55.880]  uh college student there and she was like well we kind of think about the rights for the community
[03:56:55.880 --> 03:56:59.400]  and what the community needs it's like what about the rights of the individual because the individual
[03:56:59.400 --> 03:57:05.880]  is the smallest minority so why can't we support the rights of the minority yeah and what was the
[03:57:05.880 --> 03:57:11.240]  did anyone talk about the fact that the constitution is their permit to carry other interesting
[03:57:11.240 --> 03:57:15.080]  thing when i said earlier about before the break about how the gun control groups are
[03:57:15.080 --> 03:57:19.560]  manufacturing consent from these people all the college kids there that were for gun control they
[03:57:19.560 --> 03:57:23.320]  were just parroting what they heard in the mainstream media or what politicians told them
[03:57:23.320 --> 03:57:27.480]  the gun rights supporters there they were the ones that knew about the rights and second amendment
[03:57:27.480 --> 03:57:32.520]  and the constitution and history especially history that's an important thing they weren't
[03:57:32.520 --> 03:57:37.000]  just being they weren't just parroting what someone else told them and as biggs was pointing out
[03:57:37.000 --> 03:57:41.320]  earlier in the broadcast most of the people who were there to protest the gun rights weren't even
[03:57:41.320 --> 03:57:46.520]  old enough to own a handgun in the first place so you know you you think all these people think
[03:57:46.520 --> 03:57:50.440]  that everybody's going to be packing heat around the campuses that's not the case the majority of
[03:57:50.440 --> 03:57:55.560]  the people who were there couldn't even own a handgun on the campus whether at home or at the
[03:57:55.560 --> 03:58:01.160]  campus well does it offend you that they wear these shirts that they are armed with reason i
[03:58:01.160 --> 03:58:05.560]  think it's the reason i mean that's the rapist or murder as you're sitting there talking about
[03:58:05.560 --> 03:58:10.760]  they have nothing to say uh where don't don't don't rob me or kill me i got reasons i'm on
[03:58:10.760 --> 03:58:15.640]  the reason just like i was talking to captain america we put up the video a gun-free zone sign
[03:58:15.640 --> 03:58:20.600]  doesn't stop bullets that was evidenced by the uh armed services shooting set the recruiting stations
[03:58:20.600 --> 03:58:25.320]  and also that shirt right there armed reason that's not going to stop a bullet you know absolutely
[03:58:25.320 --> 03:58:31.240]  no well that's what obama wants to do though to fight ISIS and everything it's in very reality
[03:58:31.240 --> 03:58:38.120]  not having reason is reason obama's america you're absolutely right about that well so jacari
[03:58:38.120 --> 03:58:47.240]  what's coming up on the news and i i guess i'm the news night seven p.m. central central central
