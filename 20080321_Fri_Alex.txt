[08:51.320 --> 08:59.760]  actually what he said and the implications of that all we have left in
[08:59.760 --> 09:04.440]  this country is our fiat currency I mean 80 plus percent of our industrial base
[09:04.440 --> 09:09.480]  has been moved overseas the service economy is faltering debt corporate
[09:09.480 --> 09:16.440]  private government is leveraged all-time highs we are on the verge of economic
[09:16.440 --> 09:22.800]  collapse according to the majority of experts financial forecasters we're
[09:22.800 --> 09:29.600]  hoping for just a deep recession and not a financial calamity we've been talking
[09:29.600 --> 09:35.880]  a lot about that the last few years here as this perfect storm came together but
[09:35.880 --> 09:40.440]  to have Greenspan come out and encourage Arabs to move away from the dollar
[09:40.440 --> 09:45.300]  which will precipitate its downfall is so they can fully wreck it and then
[09:45.300 --> 09:49.520]  dollarize is how they're going to turn it in the future the North American and
[09:49.520 --> 09:55.920]  then the entire Pan American Western Hemisphere and claim oh well we had to
[09:55.920 --> 10:00.680]  reorganize the dollar and put it to an international peg to rebuild it which is
[10:00.680 --> 10:11.200]  the trilateral plan for now more than 30 years 34 years now and this is quite a
[10:11.200 --> 10:15.080]  signal here the world has still not completely abandoned the dollar they're
[10:15.080 --> 10:22.520]  slowly creeping away from it from China to Japan to Germany to Russia to Iran the
[10:22.520 --> 10:26.000]  neocons get on radio and say Iran's dumping the dollar it's their fault
[10:26.000 --> 10:29.440]  while the government itself does everything it can to have a weak dollar
[10:29.440 --> 10:34.720]  policy Cheney three years ago dumped all of his dollars but that's never really
[10:34.720 --> 10:42.720]  discussed it's all it's Iran's fault they get it so the neocons carry out this
[10:42.720 --> 10:47.600]  operation for their banker masters and then blame it on Iran as they always do
[10:47.600 --> 10:56.000]  as if one country could swing the dollar out of its global reserve currency
[10:56.000 --> 11:01.040]  position into one of a faltering currency trader Greenspan urges gold
[11:01.040 --> 11:06.640]  stage to abandon dollar this is a big deal Alan Greenspan has again exposed
[11:06.640 --> 11:09.880]  himself as a trader working against the interest of the American people by
[11:09.880 --> 11:14.240]  urging gold stage to abandon the dollar peg a move that could result in financial
[11:14.240 --> 11:19.720]  chaos and an economic depression in the United States the dollar peg mandates
[11:19.720 --> 11:24.800]  Gulf nations to price their assets in US dollars and follow US monetary policy at
[11:24.800 --> 11:28.160]  the time when the Fed is cutting interest rates a system that has produced a
[11:28.160 --> 11:34.640]  boom in oil revenue but led to high inflation as the dollar weakens well
[11:34.640 --> 11:38.360]  they move off the dollar peg it'll it'll only make the dollar we can even more
[11:38.360 --> 11:43.480]  and will quote cost us more oil so you got to love the mainstream media spin
[11:43.480 --> 11:49.840]  polls basically quoting it there it this is a quote it de-pegged it probably the
[11:49.840 --> 11:54.040]  most useful thing that can be done to stop the increasing influence of foreign
[11:54.040 --> 11:58.820]  assets on the monetary system and therefore the monetary base which is
[11:58.820 --> 12:03.720]  basically the major force in inflationary pressures Greenspan told the
[12:03.720 --> 12:08.320]  Abu Dhabi corporate leadership forum yesterday this is all quoted out of the
[12:08.320 --> 12:14.840]  Financial Times of London AP everybody carried it so he's saying you know oil
[12:14.840 --> 12:19.080]  is a hundred dollars a barrel because the dollar has been devalued and you guys
[12:19.080 --> 12:24.840]  are pricing oil in dollars will just take it off of dollars and price it in
[12:24.840 --> 12:31.160]  euros or price it in a currency that's worth more per unit well you'll still
[12:31.160 --> 12:38.920]  have just as expensive oil if they price it at the equivalent of 62 euros
[12:38.920 --> 12:44.720]  instead of a hundred dollars but if they do that it'll actually just make the
[12:44.720 --> 12:48.240]  dollar even lose more favor and then lose more confidence and lose more
[12:48.240 --> 12:51.800]  value and then we'll probably be paying $120 a barrel which is what the elite
[12:51.800 --> 12:57.840]  wants so Greenspan this is like going to someone who's sick who's got a toe
[12:57.840 --> 13:04.800]  chopped off and chopping their entire foot off this is just basic monetary
[13:04.800 --> 13:11.800]  basic economic information but the general public can't find the US on a
[13:11.800 --> 13:15.520]  map does another three branches of government they hear this and they
[13:15.520 --> 13:21.200]  probably think it's a good idea oh yes abandon the dollar further oh great idea
[13:21.200 --> 13:26.440]  that's just another trying to kill the dollar this is the biggest sign yet they
[13:26.440 --> 13:30.840]  are openly trying to destroy this economy while being hailed as big fixers
[13:30.840 --> 13:35.800]  at the same time according to economist editor Paul Woodall Greenspan's comments
[13:35.800 --> 13:39.720]  heralded the beginning of the end of the US dollar as the currency of choice for
[13:39.720 --> 13:45.760]  an exchange reserves in the short term free-floating will not fully dissipated
[13:45.760 --> 13:50.960]  inflationary pressure although it would significantly do so what does that mean
[13:50.960 --> 13:57.560]  added Greenspan giving a green light for Gulf stage to drop the dollar pick don't
[13:57.560 --> 14:04.960]  you love that double-speak in the short term free-floating will not fully
[14:04.960 --> 14:12.560]  dissipate inflationary pressure though it would significantly do so according to
[14:12.560 --> 14:16.440]  economist editor Paul Woodall Greenspan's comments heralded the beginning of the
[14:16.440 --> 14:20.760]  end of the US dollar as a currency of choice for foreign exchange reserves in
[14:20.760 --> 14:25.240]  Asia central banks hold today more than 80% of the global foreign exchange
[14:25.240 --> 14:29.880]  reserves which indicate the shift of the global economy domination towards Asia
[14:29.880 --> 14:35.600]  it seems quite awkward that the UAE still maintains the peg of its currency to
[14:35.600 --> 14:40.240]  the US dollars she told Gulf news you know what I know we have even Warner
[14:40.240 --> 14:44.160]  coming on I know we have Paula Nelson but in the second hour we've got some
[14:44.160 --> 14:50.200]  time get me Dr. Paul Craig Roberts or get me just for a tell him a 10 minute
[14:50.200 --> 14:54.040]  interview I want some of their comments on this to get there I know what they're
[14:54.040 --> 15:00.400]  gonna say but you need to hear it from experts or try to pop in and get Bob
[15:00.400 --> 15:05.440]  Chapman we can get them quick and easy they're good guys we're the same thing
[15:05.440 --> 15:08.680]  from Joseph Steclitz Nobel Prize winner chief economist World Bank former
[15:08.680 --> 15:12.240]  chief economist or you'd hear it from any other expert we get George Humphrey
[15:12.240 --> 15:18.000]  in here very accredited economists and businessmen folks let me just give it to
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.480]  you straight all we have left you've heard all the experts here is the dollar
[15:22.480 --> 15:28.720]  okay and it's tanking right now slowly sliding into the oblivion this is
[15:28.720 --> 15:34.200]  Greenspan literally trying to the dollar is like a drowning man or drowning
[15:34.200 --> 15:39.080]  woman fighting to get air struggling every minute or so to get one quick
[15:39.080 --> 15:44.920]  gulp of air and being pushed back under by the global architects of the
[15:44.920 --> 15:51.920]  financial infrastructure and now the dollars went under water about four
[15:51.920 --> 15:56.960]  minutes waters going into our lungs we're starting to pass out and we had one
[15:56.960 --> 16:01.240]  chance to get to the shore get a gulp of air get to shore and Greenspan
[16:01.240 --> 16:05.600]  literally has basically taken a hammer and hit the drowning person on the head
[16:05.600 --> 16:13.080]  this is unbelievable I do not have words to explain how devastating this is how
[16:13.080 --> 16:23.000]  evil this is how over the top we will be completely financially destroyed and by
[16:23.000 --> 16:27.040]  the way every financial expert we've interviewed even mainline analysts say
[16:27.040 --> 16:34.200]  that if the dollar plunges another 20% even they're talking about more now
[16:34.200 --> 16:38.840]  putting on the expert 20 30% if it does that it will bring down other currencies
[16:38.840 --> 16:43.920]  it will cause a worldwide implosion anybody who wondered whether the central
[16:43.920 --> 16:51.120]  bankers and the big banks that are out there you know rating junk as triple A
[16:51.120 --> 16:55.280]  and in in selling securities and selling credit card debt they bundle that and
[16:55.280 --> 17:01.480]  then sell it as some wonderful security when it's horrible debt very dangerous
[17:01.480 --> 17:06.680]  especially at this time in history historically very bad investments and
[17:06.680 --> 17:12.640]  then they've been triple A rating it the states are about to go bankrupt the
[17:12.640 --> 17:17.200]  federal government is bankrupt you've got 40 plus percent inflation the last
[17:17.200 --> 17:22.080]  couple years combined with people on fixed incomes in red level crisis already
[17:22.080 --> 17:27.800]  all of this is cash skating now into businesses and companies and the
[17:27.800 --> 17:32.800]  service industry and into the automobile industry the manufacturing durable value
[17:32.800 --> 17:40.240]  added goods and green span well I mean he's been doing this now for the last
[17:40.240 --> 17:43.000]  year coming out and bad mouthing the dollar coming out saying bad things
[17:43.000 --> 17:49.160]  about the dollar coming out and saying bad things about the economy this is
[17:49.160 --> 17:58.720]  just I'm actually dumbfounded right now I I'm not even shaken I'm more just
[17:58.720 --> 18:08.080]  stunned I'm I don't even know what I'm literally speechless let me just read
[18:08.080 --> 18:14.400]  the article here this is incredible green span zeal to destroy the dollar is
[18:14.400 --> 18:18.840]  evident in numerous public statements he has made predicting the replacement of
[18:18.840 --> 18:22.760]  the dollar with a euro is the world's our currency the former Fed chairman has
[18:22.760 --> 18:27.080]  repeatedly bad mouth the dollar and hype the innovative inevitability of
[18:27.080 --> 18:33.040]  economic chaos at a time when market confidence is in the toilet green spans
[18:33.040 --> 18:37.920]  rhetoric matches out of the IMF in October of last year brazenly slam the
[18:37.920 --> 18:42.120]  dollar as an overvalued at the same time the green back hit its all-time low
[18:42.120 --> 18:46.840]  against the euro a decision on behalf of the gold stage to abandon the dollar
[18:46.840 --> 18:50.920]  peg would have disastrous consequences for the green back and the American
[18:50.920 --> 18:56.560]  economy such a move could lead the likes of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi
[18:56.560 --> 19:01.000]  Arabia to diversify their foreign exchange holdings out of dollars this
[19:01.000 --> 19:04.440]  would amount to a vote of no confidence in the dollar and may cause other
[19:04.440 --> 19:07.720]  countries with large dollar reserves may cause it's already happening such as
[19:07.720 --> 19:11.280]  China and Japan to follow suit and begin dumping the green back en masse they've

[33:46.640 --> 33:50.920]  a taxi cab to the dark side here it is
[33:51.440 --> 33:57.040]  on December 5 2002 Dillawar a young Afghan taxi driver was brought to

[34:03.000 --> 34:07.560]  homicide I said my god they killed him it became plausible to me that this man
[34:07.560 --> 34:20.160]  wasn't even guilty of anything and he was murdered in detention put people in
[34:20.160 --> 34:24.840]  a crazy situation and people do crazy things people were being told to rough
[34:24.840 --> 34:28.520]  up Iraqis that wouldn't cooperate we were also told they're nothing but
[34:28.520 --> 34:32.520]  dogs interrogators were telling the guards strip this guy naked chain him up
[34:32.520 --> 34:36.280]  to the bed in an uncomfortable position do whatever you can you had these young
[34:36.280 --> 34:39.720]  soldiers very little training just as the rules were changing and they weren't
[34:39.720 --> 34:44.320]  told what the new rules were you start looking at these people as less than
[34:44.320 --> 34:49.320]  human and you start doing things to him you would never dream of and that's
[34:49.320 --> 34:54.440]  where it got scary it was only the night shift there's always a few bad apples
[34:54.440 --> 34:57.920]  the brass knew they saw him shackled and hooded and they said right on y'all are
[34:57.920 --> 35:03.080]  doing a great job there were emails from FBI person
[35:03.080 --> 35:07.160]  Dona Guantanamo say you won't believe what's going on down here we've got to
[35:07.160 --> 35:11.560]  disassociate ourselves you have no right to a lawyer you have no right to
[35:11.560 --> 35:14.720]  witnesses you don't really know what the charges are and you certainly don't
[35:14.720 --> 35:20.200]  know what the secret evidence is against you they saw an intentional
[35:20.200 --> 35:36.240]  decision taken at the height of the Pentagon to put out a fog of ambiguity
[35:36.240 --> 35:39.640]  what starts at the top of the chain of command drops like a rock down the
[35:39.640 --> 35:43.640]  chain of command American values are premised upon the notion of human
[35:43.640 --> 35:49.400]  dignity we don't know what revenge is coming down the road there will be no
[35:49.400 --> 35:58.120]  outrageous upon human dignity it's it's it's it's it's like it's very vague
[35:59.160 --> 36:03.600]  taxi to the dark side taken from Cheney talking about we're in the dark side now

[36:14.360 --> 36:19.920]  yeah it's been a pretty great week so far what can I say what was it like to be
[36:19.920 --> 36:23.160]  I mean we're talking about the film of course but to be nominated and then to
[36:23.160 --> 36:30.360]  win when they said Eva Orner and a taxi to the dark side you know it was really
[36:30.360 --> 36:34.320]  great we were so we were so hoping we were gonna win because it's such an
[36:34.320 --> 36:38.560]  important film and you know all of the all of the documentary nominees this
[36:38.560 --> 36:42.120]  year at the five film two of them were war-related films you know there was a
[36:42.120 --> 36:45.800]  film about Iraq no Indian site there was Operation Homecoming about the soldiers
[36:45.800 --> 36:49.760]  and it was it was a great acknowledgement from the Academy that
[36:49.760 --> 36:53.560]  something is wrong with this country and the Academy is a very conservative force
[36:53.560 --> 36:57.360]  so it was it was really a great indication and validation of all of our
[36:57.360 --> 37:01.160]  work we were concerned that because of all the films ours is the darkest it's
[37:01.160 --> 37:05.160]  about torture it's you know it's incredibly critical of the administration
[37:05.160 --> 37:08.840]  it features waterboarding it features funny difficult subjects and we were a
[37:08.840 --> 37:13.120]  little nervous that maybe it was too dark the Academy but we really wanted to
[37:13.120 --> 37:16.760]  win and also you know I must talk about Alex give me who's the writer director
[37:16.760 --> 37:21.320]  producer I'm I'm the producer of the film and you know he's been making
[37:21.320 --> 37:24.400]  films for a long time he made in Ron's smartest guys in the room he was
[37:24.400 --> 37:27.920]  nominated for another Oscar a couple of years ago and I'm just I'm we're so
[37:27.920 --> 37:30.680]  thrilled because he's so deserving he's one of the best filmmakers working in
[37:30.680 --> 37:34.880]  the country today and it was great vindication and validation and you know
[37:34.880 --> 37:40.800]  it was really fun well you've done an incredible job as the producer the
[37:40.800 --> 37:45.160]  head honcho over the whole deal and I'm just blessed and lucky to have ever
[37:45.160 --> 37:49.440]  even bumped into you even because you're so smart and such a sweet person you
[37:49.440 --> 37:53.320]  also have the clip we had professor Castle on a few years ago when this first
[37:53.320 --> 37:57.800]  came out you know the clip where John you writes in these memos about crushing
[37:57.800 --> 38:01.040]  children's testicles in front of their parents and the professor Castle at a
[38:01.040 --> 38:05.800]  closed CFR meeting even the CFR's mad at him in Chicago you're not supposed to
[38:05.800 --> 38:09.720]  record it but Castle did he had to get this out and you just says yeah the
[38:09.720 --> 38:15.160]  president has that authority I mean you know immersing yourself in this film
[38:15.160 --> 38:19.920]  you guys sort of working on this film back when it still wasn't you know
[38:19.920 --> 38:26.000]  kosher to get into this type of topic back when the regime was still riding
[38:26.000 --> 38:29.600]  high to a certain extent so tell us about the process of deciding to make
[38:29.600 --> 38:34.400]  this film when it began all these locations I mean it's such an incredible
[38:34.400 --> 38:38.200]  feel getting to interview some of the guards that did the torture people who
[38:38.200 --> 38:42.160]  were convicted and sent to jail but we you have the memos and documents where
[38:42.160 --> 38:45.920]  they were ordered to do it I mean just basically the process Eva
[38:45.920 --> 38:50.920]  when the film started we finished the film about a year ago and it's been a
[38:50.920 --> 38:54.120]  bit on the festival circuit for the year and it obviously has been released but
[38:54.120 --> 38:57.920]  you know we started making it a year and a half ago before that it's really two
[38:57.920 --> 39:02.520]  and a half year process and the film came out and some conversations with Alex
[39:02.520 --> 39:06.080]  with me the director and a couple of couple of extraordinary people who
[39:06.080 --> 39:08.920]  became executive producers and actually put a lot of money into the film when
[39:08.920 --> 39:12.400]  no one else would and it became it came out of a conversation about what is
[39:12.400 --> 39:15.640]  going on in this country things are being reported in the New York Times in
[39:15.640 --> 39:19.240]  the Washington Post why aren't people in the streets why aren't people screaming
[39:19.240 --> 39:25.440]  the rule of law is being broken there is no regard for habeas corpus the Geneva
[39:25.440 --> 39:29.120]  Conventions are being discussed disregarded and it was just this
[39:29.120 --> 39:34.320]  conversation that was just about rage and it was a conversation of involving
[39:34.320 --> 39:37.880]  patriotic Americans who was so disturbed by what was happening to their
[39:37.880 --> 39:41.680]  country and you know people have branded the film anti-american and it's the
[39:41.680 --> 39:45.240]  complete opposite it's about the preservation of what made America great
[39:45.240 --> 39:49.280]  and what America should be so you know a couple of the executive producers one
[39:49.280 --> 39:52.600]  was Rob Johnson who used to be a you know right-hand man of George Sharros
[39:52.600 --> 39:55.920]  another one was John Glaskoff he's an incredible human rights attorney
[39:55.920 --> 40:00.920]  Sidney Blumenthal he's one of who was one of Bill Clinton's policy advisors in
[40:00.920 --> 40:05.000]  the Clinton administration these people all came forward early on and you know
[40:05.000 --> 40:08.160]  they put their money where their mouths were and really helped us out because we
[40:08.160 --> 40:12.040]  were having trouble getting distributors to put money up on film you know Alex's
[40:12.040 --> 40:15.880]  previous film was incredibly successful Enron as I said and a lot of people were
[40:15.880 --> 40:19.600]  saying is this really the follow-up film you want to make to Enron this could be a
[40:19.600 --> 40:24.160]  really big mistake it could be career damaging and you know cut off to Alex
[40:24.160 --> 40:29.080]  for having the unbelievable courage to nasty and dogged determination to say I
[40:29.080 --> 40:34.240]  have to make this film we have to make this film so that that was the sort of
[40:34.240 --> 40:38.800]  the genesis of the film and then from there you know we gathered as you know
[40:38.800 --> 40:44.400]  with documentaries we gathered a small and very hard-working crew of people you
[40:44.400 --> 40:48.560]  know we had one researcher we had another producer you know as a team of like six
[40:48.560 --> 40:53.360]  people and it was really about getting access getting information you know using
[40:53.360 --> 40:57.680]  a lot of archival material which you know is hard to source and really
[40:57.680 --> 41:03.160]  convincing people to talk on this film and to be a part of this film so that
[41:03.160 --> 41:08.080]  was that was you know the initial process did you I mean I'm of course you
[41:08.080 --> 41:14.480]  learned a lot making the film did you ever get really creeped out yeah it was I
[41:14.480 --> 41:20.200]  think we all say often it was really it was the hardest film I think any of us
[41:20.200 --> 41:23.600]  have ever made I mean you know the material school and you know what it's
[41:23.600 --> 41:26.160]  like when you're in an edit suite looking at horrible material you know we
[41:26.160 --> 41:30.800]  got a lot of classified photographs that nobody has seen before from Abbey
[41:30.800 --> 41:34.080]  Crade the thing that I find the most disturbing in the film is actually
[41:34.080 --> 41:38.080]  there's some it's just some cell phone video from inside the prisons of
[41:38.080 --> 41:42.520]  prisoners smashing their heads against walls and collapsing and I mean it's just
[41:42.520 --> 41:48.520]  so brutal and so inhumane and and human it's just you know it's hard to be around
[41:48.520 --> 41:53.000]  that kind of material all the time one of one of the sounds so silly but one of
[41:53.000 --> 41:56.720]  the saving graces of us making this film and keeping our sanity was we were
[41:56.720 --> 42:00.720]  making another film at the same time which was a lot lighter in subjects
[42:00.720 --> 42:04.440]  about it just premiered at Sundance in competition and it's about Hunter S
[42:04.440 --> 42:09.400]  Thompson the great writer and you know we were able to sort of bounce between
[42:09.400 --> 42:12.560]  the projects a little bit because you know a year and a half being immersed in
[42:12.560 --> 42:18.840]  torture and and your failing country is is very hard to take you bring away from
[42:18.840 --> 42:24.320]  the film with the eyewitnesses the documents the death certificates that
[42:24.320 --> 42:29.160]  the White House with the memos the orders the systematic whether it was in
[42:29.160 --> 42:35.040]  Cuba or Iraq at Guantanamo Bay where our government has a base or in
[42:35.040 --> 42:40.200]  Afghanistan that it was all the same standard torture the same century
[42:40.200 --> 42:44.440]  deprivation hanging people from the tops of their cells for days on end all of
[42:44.440 --> 42:49.360]  this beating people till they're according to coroner's reports and
[42:49.360 --> 42:54.160]  liquefied the tissue in their bodies literally turning them into Jell-O and
[42:54.160 --> 43:00.360]  then to have the White House send people to prison who they ordered to do this
[43:00.360 --> 43:06.480]  but then that was enlisted people but promote the individuals the officers
[43:06.480 --> 43:10.880]  who were actually above it and and the one lady who ran it in Iraq and
[43:10.880 --> 43:16.000]  Afghanistan they send her to the interrogation training base and now
[43:16.000 --> 43:20.400]  she's over training I mean this year I mean that just I mean to know that the
[43:20.400 --> 43:24.320]  White House ordered all this and then when they got caught they said oh no we
[43:24.320 --> 43:29.360]  we're not behind this it and of course you also point out how 24 has created a
[43:29.360 --> 43:32.800]  constituency for torture how they're brainwashing can you talk about that
[43:32.800 --> 43:37.320]  so I mean you know I think the villains of the film obviously I George Bush
[43:37.320 --> 43:43.560]  Cheney Rumsfeld John you and Gonzales but you know the big criminal I'm ashamed
[43:43.560 --> 43:47.360]  to say as a woman called Talon Wood who obviously did not intervene for the film
[43:47.360 --> 43:51.920]  and has done absolutely no media and you know she went from prison to prison in
[43:51.920 --> 43:56.800]  forcing these torture methods and as you say now you know her punishment for
[43:56.800 --> 44:01.440]  this great violation of human rights and you know the American way is to be you
[44:01.440 --> 44:04.840]  know to end up in a training and interrogation training military
[44:04.840 --> 44:08.520]  facilities but you know she's a complete villain she does no media she does
[44:08.520 --> 44:11.400]  nothing and I guess the most interesting thing one of the most
[44:11.400 --> 44:14.200]  interesting things in the film is you know a bunch of these young officers
[44:14.200 --> 44:18.360]  these ex-military guys that we have in the film who are young I think it's fair
[44:18.360 --> 44:21.680]  to say a lot of them aren't overly educated and certainly weren't educated in
[44:21.680 --> 44:24.760]  the ways of the military and they were thrown into these situations where
[44:24.760 --> 44:28.720]  they were unchained interrogators some of them had never come across the Geneva
[44:28.720 --> 44:32.680]  Convention and that's what that's what the higher-ups wanted and they'll put
[44:32.680 --> 44:38.040]  into these incredible situations of stress of fear of terrorism in America
[44:38.040 --> 44:41.320]  that that that that was placed on their shoulders and they had to get
[44:41.320 --> 44:46.840]  information in any by any means possible often from innocent people who had
[44:46.840 --> 44:50.600]  just been picked up in the fields of Afghanistan and what's so interesting is
[44:50.600 --> 44:54.040]  we managed to get a number of these people to talk to us and I think they're
[44:54.040 --> 44:57.920]  the heroes of the film because they're so brave and they're so honest and they
[44:57.920 --> 45:00.840]  know they did the wrong thing but they're also willing to talk about the
[45:00.840 --> 45:04.400]  fact that film is guided and you know when you put into a bad situation people
[45:04.400 --> 45:08.400]  do that well you also captured the essence you also captured in the film
[45:08.400 --> 45:11.720]  the essence and this is the point we've always made from guests and witnesses
[45:11.720 --> 45:16.320]  that we've had on just in a radio format that this was the White House and
[45:16.320 --> 45:22.000]  their technocrats seducing the military seducing the public really trying to
[45:22.000 --> 45:28.800]  sell us on the most barbarous forms of torture and everything in your film is
[45:28.800 --> 45:32.480]  documented in fact I think it I don't want to say it's soft it's horrible it's
[45:32.480 --> 45:36.320]  about as hardcore as it can get but you know reality is even several steps
[45:36.320 --> 45:40.360]  deeper and worse like the army's own report from the general to goomba where
[45:40.360 --> 45:45.320]  they admit raping the people using acid with large objects and I can't even get
[45:45.320 --> 45:50.600]  into it on air but this is even an MSNBC so as bad as the film is all people to
[45:50.600 --> 45:53.520]  understand and it was very upsetting even to me I got tears in my eyes several
[45:53.520 --> 45:58.520]  times studying this studying torture the last ten years knowing our government
[45:58.520 --> 46:03.680]  for decades has been training the world how to torture I think it makes the film
[46:03.680 --> 46:07.720]  even stronger that you know you guys I know could have even made it more
[46:07.720 --> 46:12.600]  hardcore and the CIA admits we've had the former section chief on that they
[46:12.600 --> 46:17.200]  wouldn't arrest real Alcada or Taliban in fact Taliban and Alcada would go just
[46:17.200 --> 46:23.200]  grab goat herders and turn them over and get 10 20 30 thousand dollars in some
[46:23.200 --> 46:27.360]  cases and the bases even knew that they were innocent but they would then send
[46:27.360 --> 46:32.720]  them on after being tortured out of Afghanistan out of Iraq to camp x-ray in
[46:32.720 --> 46:38.280]  Cuba to keep the cover up going and then the CIA brainwashing I mean it it's just
[46:38.280 --> 46:42.200]  so incredible and I'm trying to describe a 90 minute film here and I guess it's
[46:42.200 --> 46:47.360]  impossible to do on radio yeah I mean if I mean that's really covered in in our
[46:47.360 --> 46:50.440]  film you're absolutely right and you know one of the examples of that is you
[46:50.440 --> 46:53.880]  know in order to tell the story in a cinematic an interesting way we had to
[46:53.880 --> 46:58.400]  find a story in a metaphor for this for what this government is doing and what
[46:58.400 --> 47:02.080]  torture can do to people and we found that in the story of Dilawar who's this
[47:02.080 --> 47:06.520]  young Afghani cab driver he's innocently picked up and and sent to
[47:06.520 --> 47:12.280]  bargram where he's as you say he's helpful pulpified to death essentially he's beaten by by the
[47:12.280 --> 47:16.800]  military and he ends up dead and he was picked up in a cab he was driving with
[47:16.800 --> 47:20.320]  two other people who are both innocent and they were actually after Dilawar
[47:20.320 --> 47:24.400]  died they were sent on for absolutely no reason it was proven that they were
[47:24.400 --> 47:27.080]  innocent and they were sent to Guantanamo where they remained for a
[47:27.080 --> 47:30.960]  couple of years they've since been released and returned to Afghanistan but
[47:30.960 --> 47:34.600]  it was just about filling up this facility it was about saving space for
[47:34.600 --> 47:38.440]  the government it was about you know getting 500 men with dark skin and
[47:38.440 --> 47:42.160]  showing them to the world in orange jumpsuits of terrorists and it's just
[47:42.160 --> 47:46.400]  it's incomprehensible to me and it's incomprehensible to me that some of the
[47:46.400 --> 47:53.160]  Republican you know front-runners who are no longer thank goodness in the in
[47:53.160 --> 47:56.320]  the upcoming elections you know we're saying we need to double the size of
[47:56.320 --> 48:01.800]  Guantanamo you know based on what this incredible success I mean come on it's
[48:01.800 --> 48:05.880]  it's just it just doesn't make any sense you know having made this film and
[48:05.880 --> 48:10.760]  being so okay with all of this material it still just is like a bad movie well
[48:10.760 --> 48:15.040]  Eva you know your film has been done for a year but it's very timely now because
[48:15.040 --> 48:19.520]  they're gonna try a bunch of these people who have no connection to 9-11 and
[48:19.520 --> 48:24.120]  after six years of incarceration and torture even mainstream news is saying
[48:24.120 --> 48:27.400]  you can't believe anything they say and then these trials aren't even real
[48:27.400 --> 48:32.580]  trials so now we're gonna have kangaroo courts six years later well and the
[48:32.580 --> 48:36.120]  gas penalty is what they're going for I mean it's pretty it's unbelievable and
[48:36.120 --> 48:39.640]  and you know we have a number of human rights attorneys in the film and they
[48:39.640 --> 48:42.800]  talk about the fact that they had no access to their clients for many years
[48:42.800 --> 48:46.360]  and how preposterous that was and one of my favorite comments and one of my
[48:46.360 --> 48:50.380]  favorite characters is Clive Stafford Smith who's an English human rights
[48:50.380 --> 48:54.800]  attorney and he says you know when I was studying in America I had it never
[48:54.800 --> 48:58.520]  crossed my mind that I would be having trouble to get access to my clients and
[48:58.520 --> 49:03.280]  that my clients would have no right to a trial I mean it's just it's just it's
[49:03.280 --> 49:07.080]  just makes no sense it's the same kind of thought for me as you know when I was
[49:07.080 --> 49:10.160]  I'm 38 years old and when I was studying and I'm Australian and when I was
[49:10.160 --> 49:14.560]  studying in Australia legal studies learning about these great precedent
[49:14.560 --> 49:19.720]  cases like Roe versus Wade and suddenly you know 25 30 years later there's a
[49:19.720 --> 49:23.280]  possibility that they'll be turned over and it just it just doesn't make sense
[49:23.280 --> 49:28.280]  it seems so it seems like the world's a little a little backwards these days well
[49:28.280 --> 49:32.360]  what they do is and you point this out they get everybody into fear and then
[49:32.360 --> 49:36.960]  they try to set the precedent to be able to torture children in fact let's go
[49:36.960 --> 49:41.080]  ahead and you've got two different John you clips play the play the short one
[49:41.080 --> 49:45.640]  John first this is John you in the CFR being questioned by professor Castle
[49:45.640 --> 49:59.920]  about writing that they can sexually torture children here it is
[49:59.920 --> 50:04.640]  the president deems that he's got to torture somebody including by crushing
[50:04.640 --> 50:09.680]  the testicles of the person's child there is no law that can stop that no
[50:09.680 --> 50:26.080]  treat and then even the elitist the CFR in Chicago laugh at him
[50:26.080 --> 50:29.920]  even Warner the Justice Department's investigating him there's talk of
[50:29.920 --> 50:34.400]  indictments against John you know Eva yeah it's pretty unbelievable I mean I
[50:34.400 --> 50:38.120]  won't believe it till I see it but you know I always feel like these guys who
[50:38.120 --> 50:42.240]  are involved in this administration is so has had so heavily self-protected
[50:42.240 --> 50:46.400]  themselves you know I feel like they've they've written in all this all of this
[50:46.400 --> 50:50.360]  legislation to protect themselves from any kind of questioning or any
[50:50.360 --> 50:54.680]  possibility stay there let's let's talk about on the other side our beloved
[50:54.680 --> 50:58.440]  Republic is on her knees the forces of globalism are destroying national
[50:58.440 --> 51:02.640]  sovereignty worldwide but in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope the first

[53:05.400 --> 53:10.320]  country's dependence on often dangerous food imports you know about genetically
[53:10.320 --> 53:14.200]  poisoned food two-thirds of the food is disappearing with the bees along with
[53:14.200 --> 53:18.520]  huge crop failures from all-time record water shortages you know they're
[53:18.520 --> 53:23.880]  turning food into fuel with corn ethanol plants if we do not control our
[53:23.880 --> 53:28.080]  food food will be used to control us food control has been the plan
[53:28.080 --> 53:31.960]  historically in every enslaved population and is the plan for America

[54:30.600 --> 54:35.960]  Eva Horner is coming straight on for the neocon Bush administration she's in
[54:35.960 --> 54:41.440]  papers all over the world saying war criminals run our government and if we
[54:41.440 --> 54:45.360]  don't bring him to justice it'll then be in our name and people will see
[54:45.360 --> 54:53.320]  Americans as the Germans were seen after Hitler I mean this is hardcore murder
[54:53.320 --> 54:57.160]  of innocent people who they knew were innocent literally just to have the
[54:57.160 --> 55:01.200]  illusion while Bush is saying don't go after bin Laden who he supposedly said
[55:01.200 --> 55:05.840]  attacked us meanwhile let's take some you know 15 13 in some cases your old
[55:05.840 --> 55:11.720]  kids let's torture him Eva Horner you've got a delivery coming to your hotel
[55:11.720 --> 55:16.640]  room here in just a minute you may have to drop off and come back for a few
[55:16.640 --> 55:21.080]  minutes with us but there's so many facets other areas of the film taxi to
[55:21.080 --> 55:23.440]  the dark side that just won the Academy Awards Sunday night for best
[55:23.440 --> 55:26.720]  documentary other facets points I haven't brought up what do you think the
[55:26.720 --> 55:32.520]  most chilling and upsetting part of the film is I just you just I mean you're
[55:32.520 --> 55:38.880]  the expert on this you lead I mean oh god what is the most chilling part you
[55:38.880 --> 55:43.800]  know to me it's I think I to me it's really it's really the images it's
[55:43.800 --> 55:47.280]  really well you know it's actually you know what the saddest thing to me in
[55:47.280 --> 55:50.440]  the whole film is is at the end of a film when you find out you know the state
[55:50.440 --> 55:54.960]  of the number of soldiers who who were involved in you know in torture and
[55:54.960 --> 55:58.920]  brutal interrogation techniques and when you see what happened to their lives
[55:58.920 --> 56:03.000]  and you know you see that these kids in their 20s usually from the South I think
[56:03.000 --> 56:06.400]  it's fair to say you know their lives are ruined one of them says that you know
[56:06.400 --> 56:10.560]  financially he's ruined he can't get a job he's he's you know he's spent time
[56:10.560 --> 56:15.320]  in military prison and these are the victims of the administration and you
[56:15.320 --> 56:18.480]  know and everyone else who's going to leave this current administration that
[56:18.480 --> 56:22.200]  already has goes on to prestigious jobs and nothing happens to them and I guess
[56:22.200 --> 56:25.280]  that's why I've been saying that branding them as war criminals in the
[56:25.280 --> 56:29.280]  media because that's what war criminals do they commit acts of atrocity and they
[56:29.280 --> 56:33.520]  get away with that and I just I think that's probably the you know despite
[56:33.520 --> 56:37.920]  aside from all the images of torture and all of the terrible images that we see
[56:37.920 --> 56:41.960]  I think I really think it's not it's these innocent people who signed up he
[56:41.960 --> 56:45.880]  served our country I'm like most of the people in the current administration who
[56:45.880 --> 56:50.960]  then got he then got you know he then got scapegoated into and ended up in
[56:50.960 --> 56:57.240]  prison speaking of that speaking of that Eva I remember was even in the
[56:57.240 --> 57:01.720]  Associated Press and other news wires a few years ago one of the guards in
[57:01.720 --> 57:05.760]  Afghanistan a private contractor who tortured people to death he was about
[57:05.760 --> 57:08.400]  to blow the whistle and said look we were ordered to and then they use the
[57:08.400 --> 57:14.760]  Patriot Act on him to shut him up yeah exactly I mean it's just you know it's
[57:14.760 --> 57:18.400]  just incredible evil to me I mean I think another thing that's really worth
[57:18.400 --> 57:21.520]  talking about is the fact that you know we're all obviously you know pretty far
[57:21.520 --> 57:25.120]  on the on the left side all of us filmmakers but it was really important
[57:25.120 --> 57:29.360]  for us to make this not a left-wing you know propaganda piece and so one of the
[57:29.360 --> 57:33.000]  things we were very cautious and careful to do was to try and get you know
[57:33.000 --> 57:37.360]  insiders in the Republican side of the country to talk and you know people like
[57:37.360 --> 57:43.880]  Albert Morra who's a former Navy General Counsel and he was very much
[57:43.880 --> 57:47.240]  behind stopping what was going on at Abergrade so I just think it's really
[57:47.240 --> 57:51.440]  worth letting audiences know this is not a propaganda piece it's really you know
[57:51.440 --> 57:56.720]  it's a journalistic piece no I'm gonna say right now as bad as it is there's
[57:56.720 --> 58:01.080]  there's actually even a lot more you know stuff that's even worse I mean I'm
[58:01.080 --> 58:05.840]  sure you came across the Army report where they admitted that 98% that are
[58:05.840 --> 58:09.080]  sent to Abergrade were picked up at checkpoints for not having proper papers
[58:09.080 --> 58:12.440]  and that and that and that and that women were raped in front of their
[58:12.440 --> 58:15.600]  husbands did you see that yeah absolutely and I mean that's what
[58:15.600 --> 58:20.240]  happened to our lead guy who was murdered I mean and it's also it's very much and
[58:20.240 --> 58:23.160]  the reason we know about these stories is because of the incredible people on
[58:23.160 --> 58:28.120]  the ground in Afghanistan working for the Pages in America you know people like
[58:28.120 --> 58:31.320]  Carlotta Gold who discovered the Dillewa story tell you what stay there

[59:58.720 --> 1:00:06.480]  us you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:00:06.480 --> 1:00:13.720]  and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones White House people running and
[1:00:13.720 --> 1:00:19.600]  aren't stupid they're just arrogant and full of bravada full of hubris the sin
[1:00:19.600 --> 1:00:25.560]  of the gods and if they're able to get away with torture and creating a
[1:00:25.560 --> 1:00:29.240]  constituency for torture and selling us that it's okay it's over and now we see
[1:00:29.240 --> 1:00:34.560]  police nationwide copycatting abuse has gone up in the prisons Eva you know your
[1:00:34.560 --> 1:00:41.960]  film really points all this out that that we really have been seduced over to
[1:00:41.960 --> 1:00:45.680]  the dark side I think we're pulling away from it now that's why I just think
[1:00:45.680 --> 1:00:50.320]  this is one of the most powerful films documentaries I've ever seen because I
[1:00:50.320 --> 1:00:53.520]  you know I think I know it all about this stuff and I'm immersed in it but I
[1:00:53.520 --> 1:00:59.440]  became very upset and I hardly ever feel almost panicked but but it was just
[1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:03.200]  exactly like some of the cell phone video inside the torture facilities and
[1:01:03.200 --> 1:01:09.240]  my god just seeing it I mean it makes movies like saw or hostile that's
[1:01:09.240 --> 1:01:14.040]  nothing on the real thing is it yeah I think you're right I think another thing
[1:01:14.040 --> 1:01:16.800]  that I should mention is you know we made this as I said we finished it a year
[1:01:16.800 --> 1:01:20.160]  ago when we were making it you know when we started it two and a half years ago
[1:01:20.160 --> 1:01:24.360]  we were so naive our biggest concerns were God what if it's irrelevant by the
[1:01:24.360 --> 1:01:28.040]  time it's ready to come out and be in cinemas and you know you think about it
[1:01:28.040 --> 1:01:31.160]  now it's more relevant than it ever could have been and we were so naive and
[1:01:31.160 --> 1:01:35.240]  so hopeful that I do think that this is an incredibly exciting time you know
[1:01:35.240 --> 1:01:39.160]  this this part of the year up until November and I feel like everyone in
[1:01:39.160 --> 1:01:43.480]  the country is outraged everyone is furious it's so great that the film has
[1:01:43.480 --> 1:01:50.000]  got an Oscar nomination because more sorry that's got an Oscar because it has been cry
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:53.200]  sunk in because you know what a lot more people are going to see the film now you
[1:01:53.200 --> 1:01:56.560]  know still in cinemas it's gonna get a lot more people to see the film a lot
[1:01:56.560 --> 1:02:00.240]  more people get outraged and hopefully that will affect the elections later in
[1:02:00.240 --> 1:02:03.200]  the year and also you know the other thing you talk about is you know just
[1:02:03.200 --> 1:02:06.840]  how what's been going on in the country is affected popular culture and you
[1:02:06.840 --> 1:02:11.640]  mentioned 24 earlier in the show and it's funny I had never ever watched 24
[1:02:11.640 --> 1:02:16.520]  before we did this film and you know there was a weekend and I took home a
[1:02:16.520 --> 1:02:20.440]  couple of box sets of the whole series and I was just I mean everyone loves this
[1:02:20.440 --> 1:02:24.800]  show this was a huge show my people I knew loved this show and I watched it and
[1:02:24.800 --> 1:02:30.240]  I was just outraged and we use I'm so happy that we used a clip in the film to
[1:02:30.240 --> 1:02:34.920]  explain what a ridiculous notion the ticking time bomb scenario is because
[1:02:34.920 --> 1:02:38.280]  because I've seen it in law enforcement magazines long before 9-11 they were
[1:02:38.280 --> 1:02:42.280]  selling police on this that there's a bomb about to go off do you torture the
[1:02:42.280 --> 1:02:48.320]  person's child to get answers and then in 24 they actually have that plot I just
[1:02:48.320 --> 1:02:51.480]  love it because again I've mentioned already Clive Stafford Smith who's
[1:02:51.480 --> 1:02:55.560]  this incredibly UK based human rights lawyer he says you know there's and it's
[1:02:55.560 --> 1:02:59.120]  so great as he tells the story in the film we show the footage on 24 and he
[1:02:59.120 --> 1:03:03.840]  says you know there's a terrorist in he's got a bomb in Times Square and
[1:03:03.840 --> 1:03:07.480]  he's about to kill a million people what do we do and we've got the guy in
[1:03:07.480 --> 1:03:13.000]  custody so are we allowed to strap the electrodes to his testicles to get him to
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:17.480]  talk and we have a scene sort of mimicking that in 24 and then Clive
[1:03:17.480 --> 1:03:21.760]  says rightly well that's all just fine but when in the last 500 years have we
[1:03:21.760 --> 1:03:25.600]  ever been in a situation where a bomb is about to go off and we have the culprit
[1:03:25.600 --> 1:03:30.400]  and also if we do that man or woman is going to be so committed that no matter
[1:03:30.400 --> 1:03:34.280]  what we do to them they're not going to talk so it's just a pathetic false way
[1:03:34.280 --> 1:03:40.040]  to to to get around a loophole and and make torture a viable option and Eva
[1:03:40.040 --> 1:03:45.200]  it's incredibly evil it is you know this is such an important film can I have
[1:03:45.200 --> 1:03:50.360]  you and the director back on before it goes on HBO maybe for for a full hour

[1:08:52.880 --> 1:08:58.120]  defending the sovereignty of this nation defending the jobs of every working
[1:08:58.120 --> 1:09:02.440]  American and who stood up in an incredible way to globalism and the
[1:09:02.440 --> 1:09:07.920]  corruption of the out of control federal government he of course was born in

[1:09:17.480 --> 1:09:21.560]  the war on the middle class and the new book is independent today he is Lou
[1:09:21.560 --> 1:09:24.840]  Dobbs Lou Dobbs thanks for coming on with us
[1:09:24.840 --> 1:09:29.080]  I'd like to be with you thank you for the cat words you're a busy man I hear
[1:09:29.080 --> 1:09:32.600]  you're gonna start a syndicated radio show on top of your CBS TV show and
[1:09:32.600 --> 1:09:39.120]  your number one CNN show as a matter of fact we started Monday and we're often
[1:09:39.120 --> 1:09:43.040]  running a soft launch on a syndicated radio show and I'm having a ball with
[1:09:43.040 --> 1:09:47.600]  it you didn't tell me how much fun this was it is because you have the free form
[1:09:47.600 --> 1:09:51.000]  and you're not you know kept down a little five-minute segments we've only
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  got you for this segment so I want to move quickly and go through a lot of
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:58.960]  points tell us about your new book well independence day is a crime for people
[1:09:58.960 --> 1:10:02.800]  to start thinking and acting independently to push back against these
[1:10:02.800 --> 1:10:06.800]  partisan political parties the Republican Party and Democratic Party alike
[1:10:06.800 --> 1:10:11.480]  who's really brought us to the mess that we're in and now are fielding three
[1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:17.720]  candidates that say they're the solution it is a remarkable approach to
[1:10:17.720 --> 1:10:21.240]  create the problems sustain and perpetuate the problems and continue to
[1:10:21.240 --> 1:10:28.560]  run as those who will solve those problems and as a result we get more of
[1:10:28.560 --> 1:10:34.680]  the same every four years that's Patrick well we certainly do I'd like you to be
[1:10:34.680 --> 1:10:38.000]  as candid as possible you always do that but but I mean to really give us the
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:43.080]  bottom line both parties bought and paid for by the fortune 100 who could care
[1:10:43.080 --> 1:10:45.840]  less about our sovereign to you've already basically stripped mind this
[1:10:45.840 --> 1:10:50.800]  nation economically what do you see coming out of this election with McCain
[1:10:50.800 --> 1:10:57.360]  and versus Hillary or Obama I truly believe that just as you said Alex
[1:10:57.360 --> 1:11:01.640]  that both parties are bought paid for by corporate America by social that's no
[1:11:01.640 --> 1:11:07.080]  centric interest special interest and you know the great the first tenant of
[1:11:07.080 --> 1:11:12.840]  any democracy is that the rule of the majority prevails and that the majority
[1:11:12.840 --> 1:11:18.400]  will rule in the democracy but we have a representative Republican which those
[1:11:18.400 --> 1:11:23.120]  tenants of democracy were to be preserved that is the majority would be
[1:11:23.120 --> 1:11:29.240]  first recognized and rule the majority in this country is simply ignored by the
[1:11:29.240 --> 1:11:36.240]  elites of both our political system academia in corporate America and this
[1:11:36.240 --> 1:11:40.840]  and this race will result in a perpetuation of partisan control and
[1:11:40.840 --> 1:11:44.320]  the control of corporate America there will be no change I will guarantee you
[1:11:44.320 --> 1:11:49.840]  if one of the two members are candidates of these two political parties is
[1:11:49.840 --> 1:11:54.040]  elected president there won't be a change in our fortune at all you joined
[1:11:54.040 --> 1:11:59.200]  CNN when it was founded out of the gates as their financial news director you
[1:11:59.200 --> 1:12:03.600]  have been studying this you've run private successful companies yourself we
[1:12:03.600 --> 1:12:08.160]  see Congress with between depending on the poll between an 11 and 20 percent
[1:12:08.160 --> 1:12:11.360]  approval rating the lowest it's ever been both parties are reviled we've never
[1:12:11.360 --> 1:12:15.320]  seen this before looking forward that the establishment is just giving us more
[1:12:15.320 --> 1:12:19.520]  of the same Kennedy said those that make peaceful revolutions impossible make
[1:12:19.520 --> 1:12:24.920]  violent revolutions inevitable looking forward do you see some type of either
[1:12:24.920 --> 1:12:30.280]  economic or even physical revolution or or or more and more clashes between the
[1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:35.240]  disappearing middle class and these elites I happen to be one of those
[1:12:35.240 --> 1:12:39.960]  Alex who believes very strongly that either we will take back our system of
[1:12:39.960 --> 1:12:46.360]  government that is a populist representative republic and that will
[1:12:46.360 --> 1:12:51.560]  that will function after the consent of the government or we will see an
[1:12:51.560 --> 1:12:56.440]  absolute change of direction I don't think it'll be a violent revolution but
[1:12:56.440 --> 1:13:02.040]  I think there will be a crisis that will impend and demand action on the part of
[1:13:02.040 --> 1:13:06.520]  the people we can the American people right now are not being represented in
[1:13:06.520 --> 1:13:12.320]  Washington DC the will of the majority is not being being followed as a
[1:13:12.320 --> 1:13:17.560]  matter of fact it's it's been derided by those that we are
[1:13:17.560 --> 1:13:21.920]  sending to Washington DC to represent working men and women middle-class
[1:13:21.920 --> 1:13:26.520]  families this country and it and that is the foundation of this this country's
[1:13:26.520 --> 1:13:32.120]  very existence the American dream and it's being dashed by the nonsense that
[1:13:32.120 --> 1:13:36.000]  we're permitting in Washington and our own failure to demand both the other of
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:41.280]  ourselves and our government I see that one of the biggest crises is not just the
[1:13:41.280 --> 1:13:45.360]  war in Iraq now over a trillion 300 billion dollars that you speak so much
[1:13:45.360 --> 1:13:50.240]  about but also the plunging value of the dollar green span a week ago saying
[1:13:50.240 --> 1:13:54.240]  telling the Arab countries to go ahead and dump the dollar now accelerating
[1:13:54.240 --> 1:13:59.560]  that we could see this this crisis coming to a head very soon I believe
[1:13:59.560 --> 1:14:03.680]  that there is no question that they have a crisis in our financial system is
[1:14:03.680 --> 1:14:08.760]  already here when we are looking at the dollar applying to all-time lows against
[1:14:08.760 --> 1:14:14.440]  the euro falling against the yet and dropping to 20 euros against many of
[1:14:14.440 --> 1:14:19.640]  their major currencies of the world but we are that is a clear signal as to how
[1:14:19.640 --> 1:14:24.440]  much trouble this economy is in Alex as you know we have 53 trillion dollars on
[1:14:24.440 --> 1:14:28.520]  unfunded liabilities of Social Security Medicare Medicaid all of the
[1:14:28.520 --> 1:14:33.300]  entitlement programs we have a nine trillion dollar national debt a six
[1:14:33.300 --> 1:14:37.600]  trillion dollar trade debt that's rising faster than our national debt and we
[1:14:37.600 --> 1:14:43.600]  have idiots in Washington DC and academia walking around suggesting that
[1:14:43.600 --> 1:14:48.760]  the economy is just fine and business as usual will will work out just ducky I
[1:14:48.760 --> 1:14:52.360]  mean it is if it were not so tragic it would be laughable
[1:14:52.360 --> 1:14:58.600]  Lou Dobbs why have the elites that control this nation whereas 20 30 years ago
[1:14:58.600 --> 1:15:02.560]  with the last dollar crises we had they they decided to shore it up and try to
[1:15:02.560 --> 1:15:05.840]  keep it as the world reserve currency I look at the economic landscape it seems
[1:15:05.840 --> 1:15:11.600]  all we have left was our dollar being the world reserve currency but instead the
[1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:17.440]  federal government has had a weak dollar policy which only spells rack and ruin
[1:15:17.440 --> 1:15:21.520]  why do you think they're doing that well I think it's pretty clear that the
[1:15:21.520 --> 1:15:26.160]  reason they're doing it again in my opinion is that these people believe
[1:15:26.160 --> 1:15:33.480]  that this is 1965 rather than 2008 there was a time when if you lowered the value
[1:15:33.480 --> 1:15:39.120]  of the dollar would make our exports cheaper and we would push back against
[1:15:39.120 --> 1:15:42.280]  imports because they would be more expensive and you could look to a trade
[1:15:42.280 --> 1:15:48.800]  balance but we Alex are absolutely dependent on China for our toys our
[1:15:48.800 --> 1:15:54.000]  computers our consumer electronics our clothing so there's no what the
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:59.600]  economists call elasticity in the demand relationship on imports so as this
[1:15:59.600 --> 1:16:04.280]  administration has demanded that the Chinese in effect raise the price of
[1:16:04.280 --> 1:16:09.440]  their exports to the United States the reality is we're going to create even
[1:16:09.440 --> 1:16:14.000]  more inflation in this country we have the specter of stagflation staring at
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:19.400]  us totally and I think inevitably sir right now some pundits even on national
[1:16:19.400 --> 1:16:22.840]  television have come out and said that the globalist and now the council and
[1:16:22.840 --> 1:16:26.160]  foreign relations three weeks ago as you know came out and confirmed that and
[1:16:26.160 --> 1:16:29.720]  said we want to go ahead and get rid of the dollar to create a new kind of a
[1:16:29.720 --> 1:16:35.280]  marrow dollar and then merge that with the euro so I believe the globalists in
[1:16:35.280 --> 1:16:41.280]  their own words by design want to kind of put the dollar slowly to death so they
[1:16:41.280 --> 1:16:46.680]  can then replace it well I think that there are certainly there's no doubt that
[1:16:46.680 --> 1:16:51.880]  those who would in every way degrade the sovereignty of this country would want
[1:16:51.880 --> 1:16:58.240]  to certainly degrade the power the strength and the respect of the US
[1:16:58.240 --> 1:17:02.440]  dollar and it is the last thing we should permit but what we should all
[1:17:02.440 --> 1:17:06.040]  understand is when that dollar is declining as it is right now at world
[1:17:06.040 --> 1:17:10.720]  markets it is the clearest possible signal that we could have that our
[1:17:10.720 --> 1:17:17.880]  economy is in a very very desperate condition and we have to start being
[1:17:17.880 --> 1:17:23.400]  responsible taking prudent action to return to the values that makes makes
[1:17:23.400 --> 1:17:29.600]  this country great and that in every sense of the social order and in terms
[1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:33.680]  of the economic order that means we have to raise our savings rate we have to
[1:17:33.680 --> 1:17:38.280]  take control of our borrowing from overseas we have to come to terms with
[1:17:38.280 --> 1:17:43.080]  the enormous debt that we have allowed our elites in this country to run up
[1:17:43.080 --> 1:17:48.240]  well the working man and woman of this country has not participated in what has
[1:17:48.240 --> 1:17:52.920]  been a period of prosperity for corporate America for 20 years we only
[1:17:52.920 --> 1:17:56.240]  have about five six minutes left with Lou Dobbs obviously a very busy man with
[1:17:56.240 --> 1:18:00.760]  a syndicated radio show writing columns seeing in every night with his number one
[1:18:00.760 --> 1:18:05.800]  program in that time slot so I want to move quickly here sir that again the new
[1:18:05.800 --> 1:18:09.360]  book is independence today everybody needs to get it it's excellent and it's
[1:18:09.360 --> 1:18:13.320]  rocketing up the charts right now Lou I want to talk briefly about yourself
[1:18:13.320 --> 1:18:16.720]  growing up in Texas your life getting into the media being a journalist when
[1:18:16.720 --> 1:18:21.600]  did you start waking up to as you say the new world order and these elites and
[1:18:21.600 --> 1:18:26.000]  the last five six years really turning the heat up on them what was your
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:32.280]  awakening to these elites my awakening to and by the way I just want to make it
[1:18:32.280 --> 1:18:36.600]  very clear I am a capitalist I believe perfectly in this free enterprise
[1:18:36.600 --> 1:18:41.680]  democracy of ours but this is in free market under the globalist system well
[1:18:41.680 --> 1:18:45.720]  that certainly is not with in terms of that I'm talking about yes in terms of
[1:18:45.720 --> 1:18:52.120]  ideal yes and the reality is that this this country is what has created the
[1:18:52.120 --> 1:18:56.880]  wealth throughout the world over the course of the past 40 years this great
[1:18:56.880 --> 1:19:02.240]  economy has driven just about three-fourths of the wealth generated in
[1:19:02.240 --> 1:19:08.480]  the world over the past 40 years but my awakening came on September 11th 2001 in
[1:19:08.480 --> 1:19:11.960]  which I saw the way in which this government reacted and responded and
[1:19:11.960 --> 1:19:19.640]  failed to stop that vicious terrorist attack it came in 2001 when Enron
[1:19:19.640 --> 1:19:25.040]  collapsed with the corporate corruption scandals of 2001 and 2002 in the way in
[1:19:25.040 --> 1:19:30.440]  which corporate America refused to work in the national interest and to look to
[1:19:30.440 --> 1:19:36.040]  the common good but rather to try to maintain and preserve a world without
[1:19:36.040 --> 1:19:39.440]  regulation or responsibility they made it clear that they could care less about
[1:19:39.440 --> 1:19:45.760]  this nation right absolutely and the multinationals who are going to
[1:19:45.760 --> 1:19:51.160]  participate in this 13 trillion dollar the world's richest economy have to take
[1:19:51.160 --> 1:19:55.520]  responsibility and take leadership instead they have hidden behind the
[1:19:55.520 --> 1:20:00.120]  business roundtable that the US Chamber of Commerce the lobbying organization
[1:20:00.120 --> 1:20:05.160]  and it seldom you'll hear an individual CEO stand up and speak on any issue of
[1:20:05.160 --> 1:20:11.160]  involving our society our people or the national interest leaving the voices
[1:20:11.160 --> 1:20:16.400]  their voices bill in favor of the efforts of their lobby the US Chamber of
[1:20:16.400 --> 1:20:19.880]  Commerce Lou Dobbs since you bring up 9-11 I want to read a quote here instead of
[1:20:19.880 --> 1:20:24.320]  just playing the audio this is Lou Dobbs on your national CNN news program the
[1:20:24.320 --> 1:20:28.240]  fact that they would continue to prepare to perpetuate the lie suggests that we
[1:20:28.240 --> 1:20:32.200]  need a full investigation of what is going on and what is demonstrably and
[1:20:32.200 --> 1:20:37.240]  incompetent and what is worse a deceitful federal government you said that
[1:20:37.240 --> 1:20:42.280]  months ago now it's come out the White House was manipulating the 9-11
[1:20:42.280 --> 1:20:45.280]  Commission which they appointed of course they first tried to give us
[1:20:45.280 --> 1:20:50.760]  Kissinger what are you talking about incompetence versus deceitful federal
[1:20:50.760 --> 1:20:55.480]  government surrounding 9-11 well I'm talking about it in this regard I'm
[1:20:55.480 --> 1:20:59.560]  talking about the idea that we have George Senator a gold medal while the
[1:20:59.560 --> 1:21:04.720]  CIA failed to act intelligently and responsibly to stop that attack I'm
[1:21:04.720 --> 1:21:08.360]  talking about a government that continues from almost seven years after
[1:21:08.360 --> 1:21:13.920]  September 11th to leave our borders wide open and our ports and secure with
[1:21:13.920 --> 1:21:17.800]  95% of the goods and entering this country uninspected but it's
[1:21:17.800 --> 1:21:21.760]  unconscionable at the same time this president of the Democratic leadership
[1:21:21.760 --> 1:21:28.360]  and the House and the Senate all claim to be concerned about this the
[1:21:28.360 --> 1:21:32.800]  American people safety and welfare during a time of war against terror and
[1:21:32.800 --> 1:21:37.880]  yet they leave our ports and our borders wide open that's deceitful it's
[1:21:37.880 --> 1:21:46.320]  the product and it's irresponsible so that that that brings me to my next
[1:21:46.320 --> 1:21:52.320]  question it is such a manifest fraud to have the banks accepting consul
[1:21:52.320 --> 1:21:56.840]  matriculas that you get out of a cracker jackbox for illegal aliens bush
[1:21:56.840 --> 1:22:01.960]  trying to give 140 plus billion dollars to Mexico for their military when it's
[1:22:01.960 --> 1:22:05.960]  been all over Texas papers for a long time now it's finally a national news
[1:22:05.960 --> 1:22:10.400]  that Mexican troops shoot at Border Patrol come across grab drug shipments
[1:22:10.400 --> 1:22:14.440]  away from sheriffs I've interviewed that have had Mexican troops stick German
[1:22:14.440 --> 1:22:18.160]  machine guns to their heads and say give us the marijuana back can use I mean
[1:22:18.160 --> 1:22:22.120]  all this is going on and then meanwhile they're setting up internal
[1:22:22.120 --> 1:22:27.400]  checkpoints to search Americans and check our papers well it's
[1:22:27.400 --> 1:22:30.560]  unconscionable again what this administration this government this
[1:22:30.560 --> 1:22:36.000]  Congress and we the people have permitted in and allowing the Bush
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:40.320]  administration to effectively further reduced our sovereignty and the respect
[1:22:40.320 --> 1:22:45.920]  for our laws and certainly our regard for our borders and our port it is it's
[1:22:45.920 --> 1:22:50.800]  been a shameless shameless period in American history that we're going to
[1:22:50.800 --> 1:22:54.560]  have to reverse doesn't that say that they're not going to have no I'm sorry
[1:22:54.560 --> 1:22:58.000]  go ahead I've got a run I'm sorry I've been called on I was just gonna I
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:00.920]  understand you just called but of a final question doesn't that show that
[1:23:00.920 --> 1:23:04.000]  they're obviously not too concerned about a terror attack and I guess if one
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:07.880]  happens that means they get even more governmental control if they don't stop
[1:23:07.880 --> 1:23:13.800]  those further attacks and leave the border wide open you know Alex in terms
[1:23:13.800 --> 1:23:16.800]  of trying to figure out what in the world this president and this
[1:23:16.800 --> 1:23:21.800]  administration is thinking at any time if indeed they are thinking is well beyond
[1:23:21.800 --> 1:23:26.000]  my limited capacity last question absolutely unfathomable Lou I know
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:29.080]  you've got to go but last question I had to get this out North American Union we
[1:23:29.080 --> 1:23:32.680]  saw it in SPP documents a year ago now they admit that they're merging the
[1:23:32.680 --> 1:23:37.640]  Canadian and US military for domestic operations your final comment that if
[1:23:37.640 --> 1:23:41.560]  people do not awaken to the to the absolute threat to this nation's
[1:23:41.560 --> 1:23:46.600]  poverty posed by the Texas trans corridor they napped a superhighway the
[1:23:46.600 --> 1:23:52.760]  North American Union under the guise of the so-called security and prosperity
[1:23:52.760 --> 1:23:59.160]  partnership among Canada the United States and Mexico then this country it
[1:23:59.160 --> 1:24:03.880]  can kiss its future goodbye because it is precisely what's underway I think the
[1:24:03.880 --> 1:24:07.560]  new order is going to be defeated in the end do you think that I understand
[1:24:07.560 --> 1:24:11.680]  I've got to run and I do believe that if the American people awaken we can do
[1:24:11.680 --> 1:24:17.520]  anything we choose including sure that this this great nation because it's a
[1:24:17.520 --> 1:24:21.840]  blessing from succeeding generations of Americans but we have to awaken and we
[1:24:21.840 --> 1:24:26.160]  have to do it so alright Lou thanks you for the time thanks Alex take care there
[1:24:26.160 --> 1:24:31.840]  goes Lou Dobbs ladies and gentlemen that is one busy man yesterday we had him
[1:24:31.840 --> 1:24:34.560]  scheduled and then we finally got him on today and they're telling me that in the
[1:24:34.560 --> 1:24:38.640]  future we'll be able to have him for 3045 minutes but right now he's extremely
[1:24:38.640 --> 1:24:42.360]  busy starting his new syndicated radio show on Monday but I did hold him over a
[1:24:42.360 --> 1:24:49.960]  few extra minutes to get basically all of my questions out to him alright I know
[1:24:49.960 --> 1:24:54.360]  there's a lot happening with Barack Obama and Hillary Ron Paul only got 5% of
[1:24:54.360 --> 1:24:59.800]  the Texas vote but got 70% of his district's vote if you believe that that
[1:24:59.800 --> 1:25:04.400]  is accurate I got a bridge I want to sell you on the moon I've now had a day or so
[1:25:04.400 --> 1:25:09.360]  to look at the numbers from Tuesday and there is no doubt that Ron Paul was
[1:25:09.360 --> 1:25:13.000]  cheated in Texas we've caught them cheating him where he got second place
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:17.440]  in Nevada and then they just didn't even put him in the placing the official
[1:25:17.440 --> 1:25:22.080]  government numbers where he got second place in Nevada they just didn't put him
[1:25:22.080 --> 1:25:26.560]  in the running they said McCain got that he clearly won Louisiana and they gave
[1:25:26.560 --> 1:25:30.040]  him second place there they clearly cheated him in New Hampshire we caught
[1:25:30.040 --> 1:25:36.160]  them red-handed in district after district doing that and now in Texas with
[1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:41.360]  signs billboards planes blimps radio TV ads everybody I talked to saying they
[1:25:41.360 --> 1:25:46.280]  love Ron Paul I mean I guarantee you folks he won Texas not McCain every
[1:25:46.280 --> 1:25:50.600]  Republican I know every libertarian I know hates John McCain so this is a big
[1:25:50.600 --> 1:25:54.440]  issue and people say well he's already lost it's McCain now let's move on no
[1:25:54.440 --> 1:25:58.360]  now we have to set about exposing this prosecuting there's talk and
[1:25:58.360 --> 1:26:02.320]  investigations in Houston of election fraud and prosecutions there is all
[1:26:02.320 --> 1:26:07.560]  sorts of news spilling out in Texas and other states of this happening and so
[1:26:07.560 --> 1:26:10.840]  we'll open the phones up and talk about that issue a whole plethora of other
[1:26:10.840 --> 1:26:22.000]  issues 1-800-259-9231-1800-259-9231 wide open phones today we're also getting a
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:28.720]  reported on who's nationally broke they're saying this was on MSNBC and
[1:26:28.720 --> 1:26:33.320]  other places that Mexican troops fire on our troops and our border patrol and
[1:26:33.320 --> 1:26:37.320]  attack now of course we've had sheriffs on here it's been in South Texas news
[1:26:37.320 --> 1:26:41.080]  who've had the Mexican troops come across three miles across the border put
[1:26:41.080 --> 1:26:46.040]  guns to their heads point guns at them years ago we have covered this this has
[1:26:46.040 --> 1:26:52.920]  really been in the news in Texas Arizona New Mexico and a few other areas but
[1:26:52.920 --> 1:26:57.000]  it's been covered up it's finally breaking nationally we looked it up this
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:27:00.920]  morning when this when we first saw this this had been on MSNBC this morning on
[1:27:00.920 --> 1:27:06.520]  the morning job and we looked up all the stories Paul Watson Steve Watson and
[1:27:06.520 --> 1:27:10.040]  others had written about this in the last five years there were more than 20
[1:27:10.040 --> 1:27:14.560]  stories with photos videos I mean this has been they've killed border patrol
[1:27:14.560 --> 1:27:19.200]  they've shot border patrol they've killed citizens we are under military attack
[1:27:19.200 --> 1:27:22.800]  and what does the federal government do they say they're gonna give a hundred
[1:27:22.800 --> 1:27:26.440]  and forty plus billion dollars to the Mexican military to quote fight drug
[1:27:26.440 --> 1:27:30.760]  dealing you can go down to any part of Mexico where they grow marijuana and you
[1:27:30.760 --> 1:27:34.400]  can watch the huge marijuana fields as you drive down the street I mean I saw
[1:27:34.400 --> 1:27:37.320]  this one as I was a kid I saw this about a year and a half ago I went down to
[1:27:37.320 --> 1:27:41.880]  Mexico on a vacation just I wasn't even looking for it and there were jeeps or
[1:27:41.880 --> 1:27:45.920]  Humvees parked with guys with machine guns standing up in the top smoking
[1:27:45.920 --> 1:27:50.340]  cigarettes with a marijuana field behind them they guard the drugs they run the
[1:27:50.340 --> 1:27:54.880]  drugs our government knows that and they're just openly saying they're
[1:27:54.880 --> 1:27:57.760]  giving them a hundred and forty plus billion dollars they announced that a
[1:27:57.760 --> 1:28:03.680]  month ago to supposedly fight all of this while they're waging war on us and
[1:28:03.680 --> 1:28:07.120]  attacking us and the Mexican military has been videoed for at least three years
[1:28:07.120 --> 1:28:11.440]  scores of times we put it on the website American patrols posted it got in the
[1:28:11.440 --> 1:28:16.520]  video so have the other organizations ranch rescue the minute men and others
[1:28:16.520 --> 1:28:20.920]  where you'll see convoys of armored vehicles and Humvees with with with
[1:28:20.920 --> 1:28:25.360]  heavy machine guns guarding and shepherding and literally transporting
[1:28:25.360 --> 1:28:28.520]  and flatback trucks hundreds and hundreds of illegal aliens in each
[1:28:28.520 --> 1:28:34.200]  instance they shepherd them they bring them across they fire on the police if a
[1:28:34.200 --> 1:28:37.280]  citizen went down there and fired on Border Patrol they'd call out hundreds of
[1:28:37.280 --> 1:28:41.800]  vehicles helicopters it'd be national news it'd be alerts on the TV evil
[1:28:41.800 --> 1:28:45.200]  terrorist or you know evil American citizens are attacking our glorious
[1:28:45.200 --> 1:28:49.960]  Border Patrol in our military our National Guard that is not happening now

[1:30:05.120 --> 1:30:09.240]  popular vote is just a straw poll believe it or not the delegates have the power
[1:30:09.240 --> 1:30:13.440]  over the elections not the voters after the mainstream media wrote a hit piece
[1:30:13.440 --> 1:30:17.840]  on how Ron Paul quit many supporters quit as well Ron Paul has stated he will

[1:30:53.920 --> 1:30:58.480]  liberalism or conservatism but globalism globalists are concerned with what's

[1:33:19.400 --> 1:33:24.200]  the only thing all right we're back live ladies and gentlemen he's with us for
[1:33:24.200 --> 1:33:29.840]  the rest of the hour. Dr. Dina Dell really probably doesn't need much of an
[1:33:29.840 --> 1:33:33.120]  introduction in American position in Broadcaster United States who hosts the
[1:33:33.120 --> 1:33:38.240]  Dr. Dina Dell radio program syndicated through premier radio networks same
[1:33:38.240 --> 1:33:42.840]  folks that bring in George Norrie, Rush Limbaugh and all of them and he is a you
[1:33:42.840 --> 1:33:47.640]  got quite a you know list of letters after his name and first studied
[1:33:47.640 --> 1:33:51.800]  zoology at Cornell University before earning his MD from Cornell University
[1:33:51.800 --> 1:33:54.880]  on and on and on and so he's a medical doctor written quite a few best-selling
[1:33:54.880 --> 1:33:58.480]  books and we have got him on with us for the next 30 minutes I'm gonna be honest
[1:33:58.480 --> 1:34:01.600]  I used to really like Dr. Dina Dell I mean I've been listening to him on
[1:34:01.600 --> 1:34:06.240]  Kale BJ 590 for like 12 14 years I of course some we're on that station right
[1:34:06.240 --> 1:34:11.440]  now and but I've seen him change a little bit and kind of his defense of the
[1:34:11.440 --> 1:34:14.840]  establishment I think intensify so I wanted to get him on to talk about that
[1:34:14.840 --> 1:34:19.440]  today but I do agree with a lot of things he says just because the mainstream
[1:34:19.440 --> 1:34:22.400]  medical stuff you know hundreds of thousands a year die from the wrong
[1:34:22.400 --> 1:34:26.360]  prescriptions or medical mistakes in hospitals or cutting off the wrong arm
[1:34:26.360 --> 1:34:31.040]  or leaving instruments and people at the same time the alternative groups are a
[1:34:31.040 --> 1:34:34.000]  lot of cooks there and they make the good alternative stuff look bad you
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:38.320]  know magic machines that cost $5,000 that that are a piece of glass with a
[1:34:38.320 --> 1:34:44.080]  flashing light in it that con artist sell I can't stand it all the quackery all
[1:34:44.080 --> 1:34:49.840]  the kookiness you know I support a lot of the real alternative stuff herbs that
[1:34:49.840 --> 1:34:52.600]  have been proven for thousands of years to be you know have known effects a lot
[1:34:52.600 --> 1:34:56.440]  of that so that all gets a bad name because we put up with all of these out
[1:34:56.440 --> 1:35:00.040]  of control cooks so I agree with the doc there let's just go ahead and go to
[1:35:00.040 --> 1:35:03.840]  him but I disagree with him on a bunch of other issues Dr. Dean thanks for
[1:35:03.840 --> 1:35:06.880]  coming on with us oh my pleasure and I'll bet you by the end of our time
[1:35:06.880 --> 1:35:12.320]  together here we're gonna agree 100% how's that for a challenge okay well I
[1:35:12.320 --> 1:35:15.360]  certainly hope that's the case I think you're a great radio broadcaster and you
[1:35:15.360 --> 1:35:18.880]  just your knowledge is and you just keep me you know it's so fast moving a new
[1:35:18.880 --> 1:35:22.400]  topic every two minutes I just love the format you know I don't hear any other
[1:35:22.400 --> 1:35:26.240]  hosts that really do that did you pioneer that I don't know is there so much
[1:35:26.240 --> 1:35:31.480]  information out there to bring to people every day it's a huge huge it's a huge
[1:35:31.480 --> 1:35:36.200]  field and it's such intense interest so in a sense the frustration is I don't
[1:35:36.200 --> 1:35:40.040]  have more time on the air to explore more issues and it's really hard every day
[1:35:40.040 --> 1:35:44.520]  to pick what to talk about so it moves quickly it moves quickly because as I
[1:35:44.520 --> 1:35:47.280]  said there's so many important issues you mentioned a bunch of the most
[1:35:47.280 --> 1:35:52.520]  important actually and everything you said that I just heard you say I kind
[1:35:52.520 --> 1:35:56.780]  of agree with you but let's let's dig into it well what do you think the
[1:35:56.780 --> 1:36:02.160]  biggest scams are right now in alternative health care well the biggest
[1:36:02.160 --> 1:36:06.400]  scams and let's be really really clear nobody wants to throw the baby out with
[1:36:06.400 --> 1:36:10.000]  the bathwater here we have a method it's called the scientific method it's
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:13.360]  gotten us where we are we can get in an airplane we got our computers you and I
[1:36:13.360 --> 1:36:16.840]  are taking advantage of this technology today we got here with science
[1:36:16.840 --> 1:36:21.280]  medicine's a little trickier it's an art you know it's not like physics or
[1:36:21.280 --> 1:36:26.080]  chemistry and so you know we have to be a little fuzzy in how we approach some of
[1:36:26.080 --> 1:36:31.600]  these issues but to me today the biggest scams and I base it on science I come
[1:36:31.600 --> 1:36:36.760]  from a long line of vitamin and supplement manufacturers that will put me
[1:36:36.760 --> 1:36:39.960]  through medical school my family were among the first multiple vitamin
[1:36:39.960 --> 1:36:44.080]  manufacturers in America of course they didn't think it would be big time so
[1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:47.160]  they sold the company and that's why I'm still working for a living but either
[1:36:47.160 --> 1:36:52.000]  way you know vitamins there have been eight major double blind studies that
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:56.280]  cannot be questioned you give half the people phony pills and half the people
[1:36:56.280 --> 1:37:00.680]  real pills and both groups wind up the same in terms of cancer heart disease
[1:37:00.680 --> 1:37:05.600]  etc we have proven that taking a bunch of vitamins every day does not help you
[1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:09.160]  yet more than half of Americans still take them then you get a piece of bowl
[1:37:09.160 --> 1:37:13.320]  like you know you know airborne to cure the common cold one of the biggest
[1:37:13.320 --> 1:37:16.840]  companies in America invented by a school teacher I don't know how she
[1:37:16.840 --> 1:37:21.080]  skirted all the Nobel Prize winners and the more we slam these things the more
[1:37:21.080 --> 1:37:25.400]  we tell people something is worthless the the more they cling to it and like as
[1:37:25.400 --> 1:37:29.440]  you say there are really important legitimate herbs and alternative
[1:37:29.440 --> 1:37:33.280]  techniques that need the research we need to investigate and many that have
[1:37:33.280 --> 1:37:37.600]  given us you know mainline pharmaceutical drugs and treatment that gets
[1:37:37.600 --> 1:37:42.040]  swept out with the trash though to speak so in a sense the bad apples in the
[1:37:42.040 --> 1:37:46.000]  alternative movement are tainting something that could be very vital in
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:49.560]  terms of our future investigation we're talking to nationally syndicated radio
[1:37:49.560 --> 1:37:52.560]  talk shows from radio networks that are being a dell will fire out some of your
[1:37:52.560 --> 1:37:56.200]  websites here in just a moment because you there's quite a few and I don't know
[1:37:56.200 --> 1:37:59.280]  which ones you particularly want to put out but see right there is where I
[1:37:59.280 --> 1:38:04.240]  disagree I'm talking about I'm talking about people selling magic machines that
[1:38:04.240 --> 1:38:08.200]  they claim you know they got flashing lights in them and heal you or or you
[1:38:08.200 --> 1:38:14.720]  know magic I'm just so much ridiculous garbage people that's claimed this cream
[1:38:14.720 --> 1:38:19.880]  will make your cataracts fall off I mean there is just so much outright just
[1:38:19.880 --> 1:38:24.800]  total scams and they charge hundreds or thousands of dollars you know depending
[1:38:24.800 --> 1:38:28.400]  on the scam and then meanwhile you just said vitamins you know have been proven
[1:38:28.400 --> 1:38:32.840]  conclusively you can point to one study I can point to a thousand others where we
[1:38:32.840 --> 1:38:36.080]  know a lot of people I mean let's say people that have a junk food diet we
[1:38:36.080 --> 1:38:39.520]  know that supplements are good because they're not getting the nutrients they
[1:38:39.520 --> 1:38:43.560]  need so that replaces them I mean I don't know how you can say that supplements
[1:38:43.560 --> 1:38:48.480]  and vitamins haven't been proven to help because you listen listen I would
[1:38:48.480 --> 1:38:52.920]  challenge you to offer me one piece of paper that shows a decent double blind
[1:38:52.920 --> 1:38:56.760]  study that vitamins work I wish they worked I just can't go again so you
[1:38:56.760 --> 1:39:00.840]  don't agree with lioness Pauling Nobel Prize winner on on vitamin C I mean
[1:39:00.840 --> 1:39:04.800]  it's what vitamin a it's it's it's based on your collagen I mean right there
[1:39:04.800 --> 1:39:07.720]  we know that's the building blocks of your tissue I mean that's not but it
[1:39:07.720 --> 1:39:11.840]  doesn't mean the vitamin C vitamin C works listen line is calling startless on
[1:39:11.840 --> 1:39:15.480]  an important and a line of investigation so he's really should be
[1:39:15.480 --> 1:39:20.080]  congratulated for that but the truth is is that the vitamin C studies of they
[1:39:20.080 --> 1:39:22.960]  fail this misery now we're not talking about being deficient now we've got to
[1:39:22.960 --> 1:39:27.280]  be very clear here it is naive to assume that my parents made the same
[1:39:27.280 --> 1:39:32.640]  vitamins in 1935 that you're buying today we've moved on there are so many
[1:39:32.640 --> 1:39:37.360]  other micronutrients that are found in real food you do not find in a pill
[1:39:37.360 --> 1:39:41.480]  that is vitamin A vitamin B vitamin C but there's so much more than that but
[1:39:41.480 --> 1:39:44.600]  that's why green foods are good because let's say you're not getting all the
[1:39:44.600 --> 1:39:49.440]  stuff you need I mean a condensed green food with a bunch of raw unpasteurized
[1:39:49.440 --> 1:39:54.000]  concentrated food plants I mean that's food isn't it sure that could that might
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:57.560]  be very useful and I want I would love to see studies and there's certainly no
[1:39:57.560 --> 1:40:01.560]  harm from it but listen the the major I'm talking to you to study the fifty
[1:40:01.560 --> 1:40:05.400]  hundred thousand people double blind control we have found harm you will get
[1:40:05.400 --> 1:40:09.000]  more cancer and heart disease with certain vitamins I wish I could tell you
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:13.080]  it wasn't true I want to downplay that aspect of the study because it's not that
[1:40:13.080 --> 1:40:18.520]  harmful versus our our slovenly way the point is we Americans we want the pill
[1:40:18.520 --> 1:40:22.920]  fairy to come rescue us why would we eat well and eat a healthy diet when we're
[1:40:22.920 --> 1:40:26.760]  what we really are secretly saying is I want to pick out at the fast food joint
[1:40:26.760 --> 1:40:30.720]  and I still want to be healthy so I'll take these vitamins as opposed to
[1:40:30.720 --> 1:40:34.640]  controlling my mouth well I've also so possible but but but I've also seen the
[1:40:34.640 --> 1:40:39.240]  studies specifically about where they have these basically synthetic or
[1:40:39.240 --> 1:40:44.680]  artificial you know the junk multivitamins where it's it's it's not even
[1:40:44.680 --> 1:40:49.840]  the real you know plant derived or food derived you know thing that we're
[1:40:49.840 --> 1:40:53.160]  getting is that what you're talking about yes and I and I would certainly hope
[1:40:53.160 --> 1:40:57.160]  that the new new directions and supplements will be will be fruitful
[1:40:57.160 --> 1:41:02.280]  but the point is you would knock it on an airplane if it wasn't tested to be to
[1:41:02.280 --> 1:41:07.000]  be reliable you would not want your child sent to jail without evidence that
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:11.440]  your child was guilty I don't want to loosen up the standards and just assume
[1:41:11.440 --> 1:41:15.440]  because we get fooled when we make these these basic assumptions we have a
[1:41:15.440 --> 1:41:20.200]  fabulous food supply and most people turn their backs on it and they want these
[1:41:20.200 --> 1:41:24.440]  you know these the phony supplement manufacturers to make up the difference
[1:41:24.440 --> 1:41:27.720]  force and there the problem is there are some good products in there that get
[1:41:27.720 --> 1:41:32.240]  swept away but I gotta tell you something I you know the phony the
[1:41:32.240 --> 1:41:35.800]  ripoff machines and stuff like that you were talking about I'm like you and
[1:41:35.800 --> 1:41:40.280]  that I divide this into I think caring people who really feel they've stumbled
[1:41:40.280 --> 1:41:43.480]  upon something and they really want to help and they market a product in good
[1:41:43.480 --> 1:41:46.920]  faith it may not work but they're not guilty of anything they've made a good
[1:41:46.920 --> 1:41:50.360]  attempt and they're within the law then you get the scam artist like you said
[1:41:50.360 --> 1:41:53.560]  who are to me it's the same as someone sticking a gun in your belly these are
[1:41:53.560 --> 1:41:57.880]  creeps they take advantage of you they rip you off at your when you're ill
[1:41:57.880 --> 1:42:02.480]  you're sick and then your weakest moments and they are in a different category and
[1:42:02.480 --> 1:42:06.360]  yet no one seems to care about it the law kind of allows all this to go on the
[1:42:06.360 --> 1:42:10.120]  law says you can make any claim about the structure function of the human
[1:42:10.120 --> 1:42:14.400]  body you want you do not have to prove efficacy you do not have to prove
[1:42:14.400 --> 1:42:18.880]  safety you tell me any other area in consumer law where that is the case
[1:42:18.880 --> 1:42:23.480]  okay doc I want to get into some other sectors of the interview because I don't
[1:42:23.480 --> 1:42:28.240]  want to run out of time here but here's the problem you can get viox approved a
[1:42:28.240 --> 1:42:31.080]  multi-billion dollar drug and then it comes out that it's causing all these
[1:42:31.080 --> 1:42:35.080]  heart attacks and if you look at the hundreds of thousands of deaths a year
[1:42:35.080 --> 1:42:39.440]  and they can debate 151 year 200,000 another you know it's always moving but
[1:42:39.440 --> 1:42:44.080]  it's always over 100,000 where they admit that drug interactions and drug
[1:42:44.080 --> 1:42:48.560]  problems from big farmer are doing this and you know it's called liberty it's
[1:42:48.560 --> 1:42:52.800]  called freedom if we allow the government to come in and basically do what
[1:42:52.800 --> 1:42:56.080]  Europe wants to do to even start restricting you know what type of
[1:42:56.080 --> 1:43:01.560]  vitamins you can get that's the problem baby out with the bathwater yeah so so
[1:43:01.560 --> 1:43:05.600]  I don't know how we find that balance but but but now shifting gears here because
[1:43:05.600 --> 1:43:10.120]  I want to get into some other subjects I have heard you on radio say and I hear
[1:43:10.120 --> 1:43:14.360]  you almost every week because you're you know on local stations here say that
[1:43:14.360 --> 1:43:18.800]  there's no more thimerosal in the vaccines but then I can go pull up the
[1:43:18.800 --> 1:43:22.760]  Associated Press saying that they increase the amount in the MMR they
[1:43:22.760 --> 1:43:29.800]  increase the amount in the flu shots I actually did go for this interview and I
[1:43:29.800 --> 1:43:36.160]  did go actually pull AP Reuters CDC reports that yes since what 2002 they're
[1:43:36.160 --> 1:43:41.080]  making available non-thimerosal vaccines but the vast majority still are so so
[1:43:41.080 --> 1:43:44.920]  are you saying I heard you wrong are you saying that there's no more thimerosal
[1:43:44.920 --> 1:43:48.960]  in vaccines there's no thimerosal in childhood vaccines there is thimerosal
[1:43:48.960 --> 1:43:52.360]  in flu vaccines depending on the kind that you get but the more important
[1:43:52.360 --> 1:43:57.720]  issue is the merasol has never been shown to be harmful why are people
[1:43:57.720 --> 1:44:01.400]  concerned about the air the mercury that we eat that's where your mercury is
[1:44:01.400 --> 1:44:05.400]  coming from we let we allow the bush clean air standards to fly by everybody's
[1:44:05.400 --> 1:44:10.000]  worried about their fillings and the vaccines the merasol does not cause
[1:44:10.000 --> 1:44:14.280]  autism and the subject you've got proof to the other side step up to the plate
[1:44:14.280 --> 1:44:17.840]  and let's talk about it okay and that is important but there's no
[1:44:17.840 --> 1:44:21.920]  thimerosal and since the merasol has been taken out of vaccines in Denmark in
[1:44:21.920 --> 1:44:27.280]  Sweden and in America autism rates have increased so it ain't the merasol and
[1:44:27.280 --> 1:44:32.760]  no I saw that I saw that I saw that California study and it just
[1:44:32.760 --> 1:44:38.400]  blanket said that there's no more vaccine and so why did it go up from 2002
[1:44:38.400 --> 1:44:42.520]  to 2006 and if you actually look at it they didn't even check they just said
[1:44:42.520 --> 1:44:46.120]  for you took for granted that had been taken out and that's not the evidence
[1:44:46.120 --> 1:44:50.520]  we have doctor and I'm gonna actually take this interview and go through and
[1:44:50.520 --> 1:44:55.960]  write a story and add all the links to mainstream and CDC point is the point
[1:44:55.960 --> 1:45:00.000]  there really isn't the aren't don't you care whether thimerosal causes diseases
[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:03.840]  or not you got to care about that first you got to show me evidence okay
[1:45:03.840 --> 1:45:08.120]  merasol okay we took out a Houston Chronicle here it is health officials
[1:45:08.120 --> 1:45:13.400]  admit vaccines may have hurt Georgia girl federal blue ribbon panel this is
[1:45:13.400 --> 1:45:19.280]  just a February 25th this is just last month found and ruled in her favor this
[1:45:19.280 --> 1:45:22.440]  is a blue ribbon panel reading but you got to keep reading where it says this
[1:45:22.440 --> 1:45:26.920]  is not implied the vaccines cause autism this young child if indeed this is not
[1:45:26.920 --> 1:45:31.200]  a court of law by the way that one case out of millions and millions and
[1:45:31.200 --> 1:45:35.080]  millions and millions this child has a genetic defect that's very unusual
[1:45:35.080 --> 1:45:40.000]  mitochondrial DNA defect in combination with something having to do with
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:44.760]  vaccines not by merasol read it carefully may have played a role in a
[1:45:44.760 --> 1:45:50.640]  single case when an airplane goes down do you stop flying no but it's okay
[1:45:50.640 --> 1:45:53.920]  it's not gonna grow up here it's okay let me finish let me finish white
[1:45:53.920 --> 1:45:57.280]  listening you don't get technology as white polio off the face of the earth
[1:45:57.280 --> 1:46:00.480]  smallpox off the face of the earth where is the theory of whooping cough
[1:46:00.480 --> 1:46:04.520]  tetanus where these diseases you don't take that technology because there is
[1:46:04.520 --> 1:46:08.800]  some flaw and it's not absolutely perfect you drive your car because you'll
[1:46:08.800 --> 1:46:11.440]  love it and you're willing to take a one and twenty five hundred risk of
[1:46:11.440 --> 1:46:15.520]  killing yourself is here Americans have got to grow up and understand that
[1:46:15.520 --> 1:46:19.720]  technology is not perfect you have to be willing to sacrifice let me stop you
[1:46:19.720 --> 1:46:24.320]  let me stop you there actually and if you'd like actually about 50 of them
[1:46:24.320 --> 1:46:28.320]  here in front of me I mean you can just say there's not a study there's no
[1:46:28.320 --> 1:46:32.720]  proof there's no evidence all I know and then you can say well we over report
[1:46:32.720 --> 1:46:38.200]  autism you know brain disorders now that's why we've gone from one in 25,000
[1:46:38.200 --> 1:46:44.440]  20 years ago to one in 168 five years ago to now one in 75 federal numbers and
[1:46:44.440 --> 1:46:49.000]  then just I go on the hiking bike trail I go to the mall I take my children to
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:53.800]  Ratatouille and there's 200 kids in there and the front two rows are autistic
[1:46:53.800 --> 1:46:58.600]  children they have huge wings of every major school now with children nodding
[1:46:58.600 --> 1:47:02.520]  and drooling in the corner what is doing it doc how come there's just suddenly
[1:47:02.520 --> 1:47:06.280]  all these autistic kids everywhere right right but don't because it's increased
[1:47:06.280 --> 1:47:11.000]  doesn't mean but did the tooth fairy do this did the tooth fairy do what increase
[1:47:11.000 --> 1:47:15.280]  autism I mean I'm at no because you want to but listen I want to find out why
[1:47:15.280 --> 1:47:20.600]  and what's going on to waste I don't need scientific studies I've talked to
[1:47:20.600 --> 1:47:24.520]  and I've got them by the way I mean I'll be at a shopping mall I'll be on
[1:47:24.520 --> 1:47:30.040]  vacation there's a lady there at the pool she's got an autistic son and I walk
[1:47:30.040 --> 1:47:34.600]  over and I say when did this happen oh he was 18 months old let me guess he had
[1:47:34.600 --> 1:47:38.240]  a convulsion that night she goes how do you know do you know me who were you he
[1:47:38.240 --> 1:47:42.440]  had a convulsion after that and then and I said oh let me guess the hospital tried
[1:47:42.440 --> 1:47:45.960]  to take your kids saying you shook them man what it why is it they get the shot
[1:47:45.960 --> 1:47:50.040]  sometimes have a convulsion in the hospital listen this is a it's a
[1:47:50.040 --> 1:47:54.440]  common reasoning fallacy there are so many shots that are given to kids there
[1:47:54.440 --> 1:47:58.240]  is nothing can happen in the child that isn't a week or two after a shot or a
[1:47:58.240 --> 1:48:01.920]  week or two before the shot and it sure seems like there's a relationship it
[1:48:01.920 --> 1:48:07.280]  sure seems like it no and if there is we need to find out but we're just wasting
[1:48:07.280 --> 1:48:11.840]  and spinning our wheels not getting to the bottom of autism by constantly
[1:48:11.840 --> 1:48:17.200]  having to put down a theory that kind of came and it kind of went so let's move
[1:48:17.200 --> 1:48:20.920]  on why is it that older fathers have more autistic kids why is it that women
[1:48:20.920 --> 1:48:25.240]  have certain obstetrical problems well obviously they know well the studies you
[1:48:25.240 --> 1:48:29.960]  just mentioned them show that it is a genetic defect mainly manifest in boys
[1:48:29.960 --> 1:48:34.520]  and that has something to do with the absorption and the passing into the
[1:48:34.520 --> 1:48:38.360]  cells of the mercury and you're right the coal burning plants they've taken
[1:48:38.360 --> 1:48:42.160]  restrictions off Texas supplies five states I'm sitting in the middle of it
[1:48:42.160 --> 1:48:45.440]  and the mercury readings are off the chart meanwhile the global warming people
[1:48:45.440 --> 1:48:49.440]  are running around wanting to tax carbon dioxide that plants breathe yeah yeah
[1:48:49.440 --> 1:48:53.320]  all this and I agree with you I agree with you on that the point is that it
[1:48:53.320 --> 1:48:57.480]  you we don't come up with scientific conclusion by public proclamation we
[1:48:57.480 --> 1:49:02.920]  have to come up with it I hate to keep reducing it to this it sounds so cold
[1:49:02.920 --> 1:49:07.240]  and hardcore but we can't allow us to take allow ourselves take our eye off the
[1:49:07.240 --> 1:49:11.640]  ball and that is we got a we got to prove what's going on we got to find out
[1:49:11.640 --> 1:49:16.960]  what's going on it sure seems well I know but after eight major large studies
[1:49:16.960 --> 1:49:22.560]  with no medical group funded world oh you gotta hold on hold on funded by the
[1:49:22.560 --> 1:49:26.000]  big vaccine makers but let me just stop you let me just throw this up before we
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:28.680]  got a break in the final segment it's already gone I gotta have you back up
[1:49:28.680 --> 1:49:31.920]  sometime we got a lot of fun and we'll plug your sights on the other side of
[1:49:31.920 --> 1:49:37.160]  this I'll be sure to do that here's the deal you we have all the fraud in the
[1:49:37.160 --> 1:49:42.880]  FDA in the EPA we have the revolving door of big pharma people back and forth
[1:49:42.880 --> 1:49:47.600]  approving their bad drugs we know their predatory against the supplements
[1:49:47.600 --> 1:49:51.120]  regardless because they're in competition with them and and then we
[1:49:51.120 --> 1:49:55.200]  have the Tuskegee experiment eugenics sterilization in this country we know
[1:49:55.200 --> 1:50:00.240]  Hitler got his ideas from England in the US I don't have this all trusting view
[1:50:00.240 --> 1:50:04.280]  of whatever the guys in white lab coats say no I think that's and I think that's
[1:50:04.280 --> 1:50:08.120]  good I think you should not trust authority and they do screw up and they
[1:50:08.120 --> 1:50:12.840]  do make mistakes whatever walk of life you're in and there is there is fraud
[1:50:12.840 --> 1:50:16.840]  and it happens there's no doubt about it but talking about throwing the baby out
[1:50:16.840 --> 1:50:21.320]  with a bathwater it of course that's because there is fraud because there are
[1:50:21.320 --> 1:50:26.600]  illegal and fraudulent ties behind the scenes doesn't mean that everything that
[1:50:26.600 --> 1:50:31.560]  comes from mainstream science okay is fraud I'm not saying that I'm not saying
[1:50:31.560 --> 1:50:34.720]  that I'm not saying it will stay there final segment with dr. Dean Adele after
[1:50:34.720 --> 1:50:38.800]  this three-minute break I got to get him back up for longer because he's a
[1:50:38.800 --> 1:50:42.360]  great debater and there's so many points I want to bring up I know he's got a lot
[1:50:42.360 --> 1:50:46.240]  of documents as well we'll do it I buck

[1:52:19.720 --> 1:52:23.600]  fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment fat

[1:53:53.000 --> 1:54:04.000]  Alright folks I'm gonna move quick, I don't need to be able to do this into the next segment or another 10 minutes whether we appreciate that
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:08.520]  and you can just find him on any AM or FM station that carries talk he's in every
[1:54:08.520 --> 1:54:13.840]  major city in most small towns he's on 590 K.L.B.J. here in Austin one of our
[1:54:13.840 --> 1:54:19.440]  affiliates now of course we're on 1330 right now and then of course on the weekend
[1:54:19.440 --> 1:54:28.120]  and 590 moving quicker here let's take sodium fluoride I just said to you
[1:54:28.120 --> 1:54:34.800]  there in the break did you know that they take the whole waste from the
[1:54:34.800 --> 1:54:38.320]  aluminum and of course fertilizer manufacturer and then that's what they
[1:54:38.320 --> 1:54:42.640]  call fluoride that they then put in the water and you said I've never heard that
[1:54:42.640 --> 1:54:46.760]  I'm gonna make sure you get email all the mainstream documentation and the
[1:54:46.760 --> 1:54:52.000]  head of epidemiology departments and FDA investigators all saying it I mean did
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:54.880]  you hear about the the American Dental Association coming out a year and a half
[1:54:54.880 --> 1:54:59.000]  ago and saying don't give babies fluoride water right because they're
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:01.600]  getting plenty of it they're getting plenty of it as it is you got to be
[1:55:01.600 --> 1:55:06.720]  very careful now if you're saying that they use waste material to make to
[1:55:06.720 --> 1:55:10.760]  produce fluoride I wouldn't be surprised but the same token I can take
[1:55:10.760 --> 1:55:15.600]  water from your toilet after you flush I can reduce pure water and you might say
[1:55:15.600 --> 1:55:19.320]  hey I'm drinking sewage here no you drink in pure water it's just a process
[1:55:19.320 --> 1:55:24.320]  manufactured etc so I'm not exactly sure what they use to make fluoride and
[1:55:24.320 --> 1:55:28.080]  there are people in America that are getting too much Florida you see the
[1:55:28.080 --> 1:55:33.040]  little white spots on kids front teeth rotholes and that often comes can come
[1:55:33.040 --> 1:55:37.400]  from fluoride well you've got fluorosis well there's this big Harvard situation
[1:55:37.400 --> 1:55:41.640]  where the graduate doctor did the report about increased of the type of bone
[1:55:41.640 --> 1:55:45.800]  cancer but that's not a new debate I've seen a bunch of mainline university
[1:55:45.800 --> 1:55:50.960]  studies from China to Japan to England where it causes massive increases in
[1:55:50.960 --> 1:55:54.920]  that type of cancer and boys now wait a second massive increases you got to be
[1:55:54.920 --> 1:55:58.480]  careful with that in terms of implying cause and effect because it might seem
[1:55:58.480 --> 1:56:03.720]  so but to my doubling tripling depending on the study yeah well I doubt it how's
[1:56:03.720 --> 1:56:08.320]  that but do you have those in front of you but excess but excess amount listen
[1:56:08.320 --> 1:56:11.640]  there when you start doing studies here's something here's something the
[1:56:11.640 --> 1:56:15.920]  pharmaceutical companies do all the time let's suppose I have a drug and I'm
[1:56:15.920 --> 1:56:20.120]  putting it on the market and I do eight studies in a row to find this drug the
[1:56:20.120 --> 1:56:23.600]  piece of crap and it's causing side effects and killing people and then the
[1:56:23.600 --> 1:56:27.560]  eighth and a ninth study finds which we tweaked the study right find out hey
[1:56:27.560 --> 1:56:30.600]  this is a great drug and doesn't cause side effects what do you think is going
[1:56:30.600 --> 1:56:35.440]  to get published they're going to be very very careful in that you look at and
[1:56:35.440 --> 1:56:40.000]  this is what's difficult the entire body of the literature there are people in
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:45.160]  America today the membership is 650 who still believe the earth is flat but and
[1:56:45.160 --> 1:56:48.440]  they do their studies to produce it I would not offer that as evidence I would
[1:56:48.440 --> 1:56:54.440]  not say it's a controversy with 99.99% of scientists believe one thing and point
[1:56:54.440 --> 1:56:59.360]  oh one percent believe another why is it in America we want to go because we love
[1:56:59.360 --> 1:57:03.080]  the underdog I guess we want to go with a point oh one percent Dr. Dean Dr. Dean
[1:57:03.080 --> 1:57:06.600]  you're doing what the big and that's who's pushing it you know the big
[1:57:06.600 --> 1:57:09.800]  governments and banks are doing pushing for a global carbon tax while ignoring
[1:57:09.800 --> 1:57:13.840]  all the real toxic waste and the rest of it you're they say every scientist
[1:57:13.840 --> 1:57:17.400]  agrees with man make global warming when that's actually not the truth it's the
[1:57:17.400 --> 1:57:22.560]  opposite that the vast majority believe it's not man made it's the Sun cycle and
[1:57:22.560 --> 1:57:27.600]  so you're saying everybody you know they all know that put it to another way tell
[1:57:27.600 --> 1:57:32.080]  me the last time that you saw in the history of science I could I know the
[1:57:32.080 --> 1:57:37.320]  few examples here when you saw that point one percent of scientists turn out to be
[1:57:37.320 --> 1:57:42.160]  right and if they turned out to be right by the way they proved their case but it
[1:57:42.160 --> 1:57:47.520]  isn't point one percent that believe whatever you want tell me the last time
[1:57:47.520 --> 1:57:50.840]  the iconic class turned out to be right because you're talking to an old-time
[1:57:50.840 --> 1:57:55.920]  hippie here I'm a very anti-establishment guy you know I was into this stuff before
[1:57:55.920 --> 1:58:00.280]  most people listening to Dr. Dean are you saying that sodium fluorine even the
[1:58:00.280 --> 1:58:04.840]  you know big kidney a kidney foundation it says it hurts kidneys are you saying
[1:58:04.840 --> 1:58:13.000]  sodium fluoride is doesn't cause bone calcification in an appropriate amount
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:16.720]  but the Americans are often getting too much so I agree with you there no I think
[1:58:16.720 --> 1:58:19.680]  it can definitely be toxic it's like everything else you turn the heat on in
[1:58:19.680 --> 1:58:22.440]  your house it warms your house too little you freeze too much you burn your
[1:58:22.440 --> 1:58:26.320]  house down so in fact I'm getting fluoride is toxic in large amounts they
[1:58:26.320 --> 1:58:35.320]  will stay there got a break final segment straight ahead you are listening to GCN
[1:58:35.320 --> 1:58:46.080]  visit GCN live comm today it is a big idea a new world order in the near

[1:59:54.360 --> 2:00:01.960]  government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the
[2:00:01.960 --> 2:00:11.280]  GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones well he's agreed
[2:00:11.280 --> 2:00:16.080]  to come back in the future we've just got five minutes left with a nationally
[2:00:16.080 --> 2:00:21.640]  syndicated radio talk show host dr. Dean of Dell the top 15 or so talk shows in
[2:00:21.640 --> 2:00:26.800]  the country most listened to him and I was for about four more minutes here is
[2:00:26.800 --> 2:00:30.760]  I'm just gonna rapid-fire a few more comments at him dr. Dean you know I
[2:00:30.760 --> 2:00:36.040]  talked about Tuskegee I talked about you know eugenics the other things that
[2:00:36.040 --> 2:00:39.680]  have happened there's no doubt the UN if you don't know this I can send it to you
[2:00:39.680 --> 2:00:43.720]  has been caught adding different synthetic hormones to tetanus shots and
[2:00:43.720 --> 2:00:48.000]  sterilizing and playing parenthoods in trouble for yeah let's give us money to
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:51.680]  get rid of the black people I mean all this is going on that's why a lot of
[2:00:51.680 --> 2:00:55.400]  people don't trust the medical system and and you know I mean I'm sure you know
[2:00:55.400 --> 2:00:59.160]  you're a medical doctor and procedures university that a lot of our modern
[2:00:59.160 --> 2:01:04.440]  sciences were dominated by eugenicists up until you know 30 something states and
[2:01:04.440 --> 2:01:09.760]  for sterilization here and that then they went underground with crypto eugenics
[2:01:09.760 --> 2:01:14.720]  after World War two were you aware of that yeah of course but I kind of I
[2:01:14.720 --> 2:01:19.120]  kind of don't think it's helpful to take our past mistakes and condemn the future
[2:01:19.120 --> 2:01:23.280]  I agree with you these things have been horrible black marks on the history of
[2:01:23.280 --> 2:01:27.680]  science and like the horrible black listen you can say America is a horrible
[2:01:27.680 --> 2:01:31.160]  horrible country because of all the horrible things we did and look at our
[2:01:31.160 --> 2:01:34.400]  mistakes and go down all the bad things we've done internationally and with
[2:01:34.400 --> 2:01:38.200]  other countries in a war and violence and blah blah blah blah in our history
[2:01:38.200 --> 2:01:42.400]  it doesn't mean we're not a great country every you know so I think you
[2:01:42.400 --> 2:01:46.240]  gotta be very very careful when you raise these issues in terms of throwing the
[2:01:46.240 --> 2:01:50.120]  baby out with the bathwater because but I'm not saying the whole country is bad
[2:01:50.120 --> 2:01:57.520]  I'm saying these mad scientist who literally I mean that guy Watson at the
[2:01:57.520 --> 2:02:01.400]  human genome project at Cold Springs Harbor he was there when it was eugenics
[2:02:01.400 --> 2:02:08.120]  I read books all of them though I'm telling you what now what don't say
[2:02:08.120 --> 2:02:15.920]  all of them not okay 95% of the captains are 5% not all you said all I'm
[2:02:15.920 --> 2:02:20.320]  saying the vast majority of the captains well you know what I mean 50 years
[2:02:20.320 --> 2:02:23.880]  ago almost everybody at the highest levels of science in this country in
[2:02:23.880 --> 2:02:28.200]  England and Germany was a raving racist everybody knows that well I think 50
[2:02:28.200 --> 2:02:33.840]  years ago most people were but those ideas in America you know I'm a
[2:02:33.840 --> 2:02:38.160]  child of World War two and I would say we haven't we had and still have a
[2:02:38.160 --> 2:02:42.640]  problem with all this but I'm saying it's like autopilot it's like autopilot
[2:02:42.640 --> 2:02:46.560]  their ideas their systems of bioethics I mean you read the Wall Street Journal
[2:02:46.560 --> 2:02:50.560]  pieces about how that people will be begging for food and water and they
[2:02:50.560 --> 2:02:54.120]  assanguiate him I'm not talking about Terry shyvo I'm talking I mean you know
[2:02:54.120 --> 2:02:57.840]  about those cases yes of course but listen I don't know and you tell me what
[2:02:57.840 --> 2:03:02.240]  you think and what what profession do you think does not have it's really bad
[2:03:02.240 --> 2:03:05.680]  apples I'm not your talk show host well what what do you want everything does I
[2:03:05.680 --> 2:03:09.280]  agree with you but I'm asking you last question is this why have doctors stop
[2:03:09.280 --> 2:03:14.080]  giving the Hippocratic of I don't know if they haven't I took it in medicine the
[2:03:14.080 --> 2:03:17.200]  Hippocratic oath was written 2,000 years ago and if you're reading it talks
[2:03:17.200 --> 2:03:21.840]  about not taking money from slaves and not it's like totally totally out of
[2:03:21.840 --> 2:03:25.880]  touch we are a very highly screened group of professionals with bad apples
[2:03:25.880 --> 2:03:30.680]  unethical immoral people in it but I'll bet you if you took a survey of lawyers
[2:03:30.680 --> 2:03:35.680]  politicians businessmen it says no higher rate they would have a higher rate
[2:03:35.680 --> 2:03:39.680]  and we're humans we're humans you know so it's important for the public to be
[2:03:39.680 --> 2:03:44.520]  aware of this so they can avoid this look our medical practitioners are very
[2:03:44.520 --> 2:03:49.200]  professional it's a very important priest guild we all know what it is with a
[2:03:49.200 --> 2:03:52.840]  little double snakes going up the tree and all the rest of it and we were and
[2:03:52.840 --> 2:03:57.080]  we worship our doctors I understand that I just don't wait a second go back I
[2:03:57.080 --> 2:04:00.040]  don't understand that I you know we'll get off the pedestals and people go off
[2:04:00.040 --> 2:04:03.480]  their knees no need to worship us I think we'd be a lot healthier to not
[2:04:03.480 --> 2:04:08.200]  worship doctors so I agree with you well will you come back on sometimes we can
[2:04:08.200 --> 2:04:13.400]  have further debates any time this is fun well you've written a lot of books
[2:04:13.400 --> 2:04:16.320]  and I've been trying to make you plug them I mean what some of the books come
[2:04:16.320 --> 2:04:20.480]  on plug them for us not a plugger I could oh the first book is the drink and
[2:04:20.480 --> 2:04:25.400]  you marry I think that's a good one and the most recent book is life liberty and
[2:04:25.400 --> 2:04:29.000]  the pursuit of health doctor Dean I've got your email I'm gonna send you a
[2:04:29.000 --> 2:04:31.800]  bunch of stuff about what they're putting in the water and if I send you
[2:04:31.800 --> 2:04:35.200]  proof that they're putting toxic waste in the water will you any information on
[2:04:35.200 --> 2:04:39.400]  an information junkie but beware I will send you back information I'll ask you
[2:04:39.400 --> 2:04:42.320]  about it the next time we're together alright thanks for spending time with us
[2:04:42.320 --> 2:04:49.000]  alright alright we'll be right back folks our beloved Republic is on her
[2:04:49.000 --> 2:04:52.440]  knees the forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty

[2:06:53.760 --> 2:06:57.160]  that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in
[2:06:57.160 --> 2:07:01.880]  their own vehicles very few consumers even know such products exist SFR has
[2:07:01.880 --> 2:07:05.560]  obtained this technology that is backed by testing at the major oil companies
[2:07:05.560 --> 2:07:09.360]  have run yet they don't want you to know about them this product is made right
[2:07:09.360 --> 2:07:13.280]  here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your
[2:07:13.280 --> 2:07:18.920]  local store SFR last up to six months SFR works so well that it even improves
[2:07:18.920 --> 2:07:23.680]  mileage on new cars SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over
[2:07:23.680 --> 2:07:27.480]  the United States was so strong that they are allowing my listeners to buy one
[2:07:27.480 --> 2:07:32.400]  at their regular price of 995 and get another one free of charge if you are
[2:07:32.400 --> 2:07:36.720]  not completely delighted with the savings SFR will refund the purchase price and
[2:07:36.720 --> 2:07:42.720]  shipping share in the oil company secret and get SFR now call 888 use SFR one
[2:07:42.720 --> 2:07:49.440]  that's 888 use SFR one today the Genesis communications radio network
[2:07:49.440 --> 2:08:05.360]  proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[2:08:05.360 --> 2:08:10.120]  mainstream news articles here in front of me where the big consortium of central
[2:08:10.120 --> 2:08:15.600]  banks have gotten together publicly saying we must have these new global
[2:08:15.600 --> 2:08:23.520]  taxes we must stop the global warming we must save the earth it must happen now
[2:08:23.520 --> 2:08:27.280]  and then you go back to the IMF and World Bank documents you go back to the
[2:08:27.280 --> 2:08:32.840]  Club of Rum documents they state in fact just what on Monday I was reading
[2:08:32.840 --> 2:08:37.320]  Richard in Haas the president of the council on fine relations and the big
[2:08:37.320 --> 2:08:43.160]  business roundtable group here in the US saying it's a it's a fake front we need
[2:08:43.160 --> 2:08:46.840]  to say global warming is a unifying effect to organize the people around it
[2:08:46.840 --> 2:08:51.960]  and that the real threat is humanity this is their way of taxing and regulating
[2:08:51.960 --> 2:08:58.000]  controlling your life the entire solar system is heating up when I had the air
[2:08:58.000 --> 2:09:03.280]  to the Rothschild dynasty on during live earth last year it's in my film in game
[2:09:03.280 --> 2:09:08.240]  I said well why are Jupiter and Saturn and their moons heating up and he said
[2:09:08.240 --> 2:09:11.480]  because they're closer to the Sun than the earth and I said no they're not and
[2:09:11.480 --> 2:09:15.400]  he said yes they are and people emailed me and said that I was wrong and that the
[2:09:15.400 --> 2:09:20.640]  earth is further away from the Sun than Jupiter and Saturn and Uranus folks the
[2:09:20.640 --> 2:09:25.360]  public literally I mean I'm not even smart but the people that follow this
[2:09:25.360 --> 2:09:32.600]  stuff are like cult members I mean they just do not care and so what they do is
[2:09:32.600 --> 2:09:37.600]  they want to tax inert gases like carbon dioxide it's life-giving and things
[2:09:37.600 --> 2:09:41.720]  like ozone but they don't ever want to stay stop coal plants in Texas burning
[2:09:41.720 --> 2:09:45.600]  mercury coal very dirty coal oh no something that actually might hurt you
[2:09:45.600 --> 2:09:48.760]  we're not gonna do anything about see because the big corporations run all
[2:09:48.760 --> 2:09:57.880]  this and we are honored to be joined by retired physics professor 30 plus years
[2:09:57.880 --> 2:10:01.760]  the University of Connecticut and he's a top physicist I was reading over his
[2:10:01.760 --> 2:10:06.000]  bio here I've got one of the shorter bios here but I'm not gonna read the
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:11.080]  whole thing because we don't have time he could tell you more about himself but
[2:10:11.080 --> 2:10:15.760]  he has also published quite a few books and a few of them I pertain to the whole
[2:10:15.760 --> 2:10:21.840]  global warming hoax that we're facing and that we're here looking at and so I
[2:10:21.840 --> 2:10:27.800]  am very honored to have Howard C. Hayden on with us thanks for coming on yeah
[2:10:27.800 --> 2:10:32.960]  you're very welcome let me just ask you as a physics professor is the earth
[2:10:32.960 --> 2:10:38.880]  closer to the Sun than Jupiter absolutely Jupiter is five point two
[2:10:38.880 --> 2:10:45.880]  times as far from the Sun as the earth is that's but but but maybe we're liars you
[2:10:45.880 --> 2:10:48.080]  know I mean that's all these environmentalists do they want to
[2:10:48.080 --> 2:10:51.200]  actually look into what we say they just maybe they're right maybe it's
[2:10:51.200 --> 2:10:56.360]  closer well I think they just ought to look it up in in any astronomy book that
[2:10:56.360 --> 2:11:03.840]  they can find and I mean for gosh sakes that's been known since oh the
[2:11:03.840 --> 2:11:09.040]  hundreds of years so what are they talking well by the way sir I'm not
[2:11:09.040 --> 2:11:12.920]  even you know this sounds like satire and a little bit of it is but it's not
[2:11:12.920 --> 2:11:16.520]  real satire you know one-fifth of Americans in major studies can't find
[2:11:16.520 --> 2:11:19.720]  the US on a map eighty percent of high school graduates don't know who the
[2:11:19.720 --> 2:11:23.760]  vice president is I think they're getting away with this hoax because the
[2:11:23.760 --> 2:11:30.120]  public literally is in La La Land well I think they are in there there are a
[2:11:30.120 --> 2:11:34.920]  couple things that are driving the hoax one of them is that there are some
[2:11:34.920 --> 2:11:41.520]  scientists and they are not I repeat not the majority who are committed to the
[2:11:41.520 --> 2:11:47.520]  idea that global warming a is happening and be that we are responsible
[2:11:47.520 --> 2:11:53.600]  there are some and the media have turned it into quite a frenzy but
[2:11:53.600 --> 2:12:02.160]  there is also a huge amount of money driving this this scenario for example
[2:12:02.160 --> 2:12:08.440]  I saw a huge billboard at at Times Square last week there was advertising
[2:12:08.440 --> 2:12:19.480]  gloom and doom it showed London under ocean waves in 2092 and it showed let's
[2:12:19.480 --> 2:12:28.520]  see what the heck was it Beijing under desert dunes in a matter of I don't know
[2:12:28.520 --> 2:12:34.440]  30 40 years something like that and so I inquired what those billboards cost to
[2:12:34.440 --> 2:12:40.280]  run and I don't have anything official on it yet but it's somewhere around
[2:12:40.280 --> 2:12:46.240]  $700,000 a month so where exactly is the money coming from that's
[2:12:46.240 --> 2:12:54.320]  advertising this and my my own presumption is but I don't have any proof
[2:12:54.320 --> 2:13:02.240]  yet but it's people who intend to cash in on the carbon credit trading this was
[2:13:02.240 --> 2:13:07.120]  a scam that was started by Enron and though Enron went under because of its
[2:13:07.120 --> 2:13:17.600]  own internal malice let's call it the the scam lives on so so we have that we
[2:13:17.600 --> 2:13:22.320]  have that going on and there are people that stand to earn a tremendous amount of
[2:13:22.320 --> 2:13:27.760]  money by doing nothing more than buying and selling carbon credit was the carbon
[2:13:27.760 --> 2:13:31.320]  credits it's cap and trade but they're talking about regulators in your house
[2:13:31.320 --> 2:13:36.840]  for adding new windows or are when you buy a home social workers literally
[2:13:36.840 --> 2:13:41.920]  over all the farms and ranches I mean just a rain of government terror
[2:13:41.920 --> 2:13:47.160]  basically communism but run by the big corporations where they administer it
[2:13:47.160 --> 2:13:54.400]  all well take a look at that first word in cap and trade it's cap now what
[2:13:54.400 --> 2:14:04.720]  Supreme Soviet decides exactly how much co2 you or I or some given company or
[2:14:04.720 --> 2:14:13.200]  some given corporation or some given country is allowed to emit and therein
[2:14:13.200 --> 2:14:23.000]  lies let's say a lot of control to put it mildly well I've seen two mainstream
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:26.320]  news articles this week where the big consortium of banks are coming out saying
[2:14:26.320 --> 2:14:30.920]  save the earth we're all dead give us this new global tax and they now admit
[2:14:30.920 --> 2:14:35.720]  now we got the SPP documents from the security prosperity partnership and they
[2:14:35.720 --> 2:14:41.480]  said well they want a North American taxing grid they want to tax each car
[2:14:41.480 --> 2:14:47.640]  the the Seattle Post intelligence are reported last week the government wants
[2:14:47.640 --> 2:14:51.680]  to put a transponder in every car and taxes and if you complain well you it's
[2:14:51.680 --> 2:14:57.640]  for the earth yeah yeah on the children don't forget the children exactly it's
[2:14:57.640 --> 2:15:03.440]  it's it's it's for the children just from the perspective of the books you've
[2:15:03.440 --> 2:15:06.960]  written on this as a physicist in layman's terms for people to understand
[2:15:06.960 --> 2:15:13.880]  why is their claim of man-made global warming a hoax well it boils down to
[2:15:13.880 --> 2:15:20.480]  nothing more than a simple correlation and that is that the the earth has been
[2:15:20.480 --> 2:15:27.040]  warming up and co2 emissions have been going up and people see that there is
[2:15:27.040 --> 2:15:34.600]  some kind of a link between the two and indeed you have to go back about a
[2:15:34.600 --> 2:15:40.720]  century about a century ago a guy named Arrhenius had figured out that
[2:15:40.720 --> 2:15:46.000]  additional co2 would cause some heating of the earth now it turned out that all
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:53.360]  his numbers were wrong but the principle remains that co2 is a greenhouse gas but
[2:15:53.360 --> 2:16:01.200]  it is a minor greenhouse gas that lies way behind water vapor which lies way
[2:16:01.200 --> 2:16:12.560]  behind clouds and furthermore the thing that is not understood is that all of
[2:16:12.560 --> 2:16:18.480]  the carbon dioxide that goes into the atmosphere every year by that is put up
[2:16:18.480 --> 2:16:23.960]  there by humans because we burn coal we burn oil we burn natural gas all that
[2:16:23.960 --> 2:16:30.200]  co2 we put into the air is no more than about 3% of the co2 that goes into the
[2:16:30.200 --> 2:16:38.000]  air and the other 97% comes from totally natural sources humans plankton
[2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:46.720]  animals primarily the ocean the warm ocean is an emitter of co2 coal oceans
[2:16:46.720 --> 2:16:53.960]  are an absorber and historically the when the oceans have warmed up because of
[2:16:53.960 --> 2:17:02.800]  let's say orbital and solar effects that when the earth those have caused the
[2:17:02.800 --> 2:17:07.760]  earth to warm up the earth the oceans have subsequently warmed up and then the
[2:17:07.760 --> 2:17:13.320]  co2 has followed suit and increased in the in the atmosphere well I mean Al
[2:17:13.320 --> 2:17:18.240]  Gore in his film earth on the balance or an inconvenient truth his book and the
[2:17:18.240 --> 2:17:27.440]  film he shows the graph but he lies and puts the co2 in red underneath the the
[2:17:27.440 --> 2:17:31.720]  green for the warming trend but in all the studies from all the universities
[2:17:31.720 --> 2:17:35.880]  and different sciences and different divisions it all shows the same data
[2:17:35.880 --> 2:17:42.240]  that about 600 years after heating you then get carbon dioxide increasing not
[2:17:42.240 --> 2:17:46.400]  carbon dioxide goes up and then heat goes up it is that a correct statement
[2:17:46.400 --> 2:17:53.280]  you are correct but there was a another time lag and that is because the data
[2:17:53.280 --> 2:18:00.160]  that everybody refers to were taken at bostock which is in the fairly deep
[2:18:00.160 --> 2:18:06.840]  inland in Antarctica where it is really very cold and they pull up ice cores but
[2:18:06.840 --> 2:18:15.280]  the data points in that graph are about a thousand years apart and it took more
[2:18:15.280 --> 2:18:21.520]  you know later research to sort of correlate things deep in Antarctica
[2:18:21.520 --> 2:18:26.000]  with things nearer the shore where the snow piles up faster and you have higher
[2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:33.760]  resolution to determine that really the co2 did come after the temperature
[2:18:33.760 --> 2:18:43.280]  changes so that let's say 30 40 years ago it was quite reasonable to assume that
[2:18:43.280 --> 2:18:49.720]  possibly the co2 might have come first or that they they change simultaneously
[2:18:49.720 --> 2:18:54.880]  because the you couldn't tell from the data but newer data that is taken within
[2:18:54.880 --> 2:19:00.040]  the last 10 years really nail that down how do they get that is it a
[2:19:00.040 --> 2:19:05.080]  spectrometer or or how are they how are they getting that data out of the ice
[2:19:05.080 --> 2:19:12.360]  well you drill a core which people do in the ice they do the same thing when
[2:19:12.360 --> 2:19:16.280]  they do mining they should make sure I'm pulling up the plug but I mean what
[2:19:16.280 --> 2:19:20.520]  tools are they using to like get that data okay well the first thing they do
[2:19:20.520 --> 2:19:26.640]  is they take they take part of this long cylinder of ice and they slice it into a
[2:19:26.640 --> 2:19:32.800]  thin slice and they know how deep down this was so they have some idea of the
[2:19:32.800 --> 2:19:41.800]  date and then they basically put it into a vacuum system while it's still very
[2:19:41.800 --> 2:19:45.000]  professor professor doctor stay right there we're gonna come right back to you
[2:19:45.000 --> 2:19:52.240]  for this quick break thanks for joining us it is a big idea a new world order in

[2:24:05.400 --> 2:24:13.840]  seashores of all Mexico it sounds so good well he's written quite a few books
[2:24:13.840 --> 2:24:18.560]  one of them is a primer on co2 and climate by Howard C. Hayden this is a
[2:24:18.560 --> 2:24:21.280]  short segment we're gonna come back in the longer segment finish up with him
[2:24:21.280 --> 2:24:24.560]  and then take a few of your calls and recap some top stories get a few things
[2:24:24.560 --> 2:24:30.360]  I haven't covered yet look I've studied history I've studied the different
[2:24:30.360 --> 2:24:33.520]  climate changes we know for 500 years they've been keeping pretty good
[2:24:33.520 --> 2:24:39.760]  records in places like England really 300 but we know that the earth's
[2:24:39.760 --> 2:24:43.280]  changing all the time the solar system is changing all the time the moons of
[2:24:43.280 --> 2:24:47.720]  Saturn and Jupiter that were ice are melting up until just a few months ago
[2:24:47.720 --> 2:24:52.160]  now the Sun just cooled off according to NASA and three other institutions that
[2:24:52.160 --> 2:24:57.760]  gauge it's how much energy it's putting off can can you elaborate on that and
[2:24:57.760 --> 2:25:04.360]  then get back into the ice core sir sure well let's the thing just to finish up
[2:25:04.360 --> 2:25:10.880]  about the ice cores what they do is they just heat the eye of the ice core up or
[2:25:10.880 --> 2:25:14.600]  the slice of the ice core up and then they measure the gas that's in it and
[2:25:14.600 --> 2:25:21.640]  they can tell how much co2 is there but yeah they the Sun has varied quite a bit
[2:25:21.640 --> 2:25:26.040]  over over a period of time and they're there's the the earth's climate has
[2:25:26.040 --> 2:25:37.840]  varied a whole lot excuse me here just a minute here the glaciers for example
[2:25:37.840 --> 2:25:42.400]  people talk about there the fact that they're receding well they have been
[2:25:42.400 --> 2:25:49.960]  receding quite steadily since about 1750 which is a long time before we started
[2:25:49.960 --> 2:25:54.120]  using fossil fuel now weren't they receding for the last 12,000 years since
[2:25:54.120 --> 2:25:58.880]  the end of the last ice age I mean there were glaciers to into north Texas I
[2:25:58.880 --> 2:26:04.680]  mean but yeah yeah well there it's the long long time it's about 18,000 years
[2:26:04.680 --> 2:26:09.480]  ago when we are in the depths of the last ice age but then we went through the
[2:26:09.480 --> 2:26:14.280]  little ice age you know there's things warmed up and in the medieval warm
[2:26:14.280 --> 2:26:20.360]  period which some people denied the existence of things are really quite
[2:26:20.360 --> 2:26:25.480]  jolly we had nice warm weather and so forth and then they cooled off in the
[2:26:25.480 --> 2:26:31.680]  little ice age and that was basically coincident with the cooling of the Sun
[2:26:31.680 --> 2:26:38.920]  and now they this it's begun to warm up and the little ice age ended somewhere
[2:26:38.920 --> 2:26:44.280]  around 1750 now now now you're one of the big experts on this but I've
[2:26:44.280 --> 2:26:47.760]  interviewed literally probably 50 people on this subject I've seen the great
[2:26:47.760 --> 2:26:54.480]  documentary they just put out in England you know debunking are we still
[2:26:54.480 --> 2:27:04.160]  there well okay sir yeah we are we are back here we've been having I'm in
[2:27:04.160 --> 2:27:09.000]  Texas there in Minnesota and we were now able to get you back on are you there
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:13.640]  sir yeah I'm here okay fantastic yeah I'm in Texas they're Minnesota and we're
[2:27:13.640 --> 2:27:16.760]  putting in new lines today so I think that's a man may have been what just
[2:27:16.760 --> 2:27:23.520]  happened I'm trying to understand here though I mean the science is so simple
[2:27:23.520 --> 2:27:27.880]  how are they able to then engage in this hoax and why did they decide to push
[2:27:27.880 --> 2:27:35.880]  this hoax well it's a lie I'm not too good on human motivation I don't really
[2:27:35.880 --> 2:27:40.120]  under understand human motivations except some people are really driven by
[2:27:40.120 --> 2:27:49.120]  money there the thing that people are looking at is basically computer
[2:27:49.120 --> 2:27:55.640]  programs they have their right computer programs and they've actually got gloom
[2:27:55.640 --> 2:28:03.440]  and doom built into them for example there was a a recent paper that I can't
[2:28:03.440 --> 2:28:09.120]  give you the exact details on this thing but it was it was published and what it
[2:28:09.120 --> 2:28:15.960]  what it described was a positive feedback system whereby if we heated up
[2:28:15.960 --> 2:28:20.640]  the earth a little bit by carbon dioxide then that would kick in more water
[2:28:20.640 --> 2:28:24.000]  vapor into the air and the heat up the earth a whole lot more and we're
[2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:30.840]  heading for hell in the handbasket and so forth and so the one chap who is
[2:28:30.840 --> 2:28:36.120]  really quite up on this thing studied that and he took part of their computer
[2:28:36.120 --> 2:28:41.680]  program and just threw some random numbers in and it it showed that there
[2:28:41.680 --> 2:28:47.320]  that their program was guaranteeing a positive feedback there was something
[2:28:47.320 --> 2:28:53.720]  wrong with their computer program so he wrote a paper and sent it to the journal
[2:28:53.720 --> 2:28:59.000]  that had published that particular article and they sent it on to the
[2:28:59.000 --> 2:29:05.280]  author and the good news is that the author said oh my gosh you are right so
[2:29:05.280 --> 2:29:12.200]  anyway the all of these scenarios about global warming are played out of
[2:29:12.200 --> 2:29:21.280]  people's computers not in reality absolutely stay there and I saw some
[2:29:21.280 --> 2:29:25.360]  of the reports they would enter into the computer that it was the co2 that
[2:29:25.360 --> 2:29:29.840]  supposedly had this effect and not the Sun and there would be two different
[2:29:29.840 --> 2:29:39.360]  you know responses from what reality would have shown we're on the March the
[2:29:39.360 --> 2:29:46.480]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[2:33:00.320 --> 2:33:05.080]  University of Connecticut he's written quite a few scholarly works on the
[2:33:05.080 --> 2:33:12.120]  environment a primer on co2 and climate the solar fraud and other publications
[2:33:12.120 --> 2:33:16.520]  you can find out more by going to amazon.com his name is Howard C. Hayden
[2:33:16.520 --> 2:33:22.960]  professor dr. Hayden I kind of got caught short there on the break the
[2:33:22.960 --> 2:33:27.720]  point I was trying to make was this and I'm just reading the scholarly reports
[2:33:27.720 --> 2:33:33.240]  and seeing the news reports about it so I'm a layman so correct me but say
[2:33:33.240 --> 2:33:37.680]  they'll have an ocean rising model and then they won't even feed in all these
[2:33:37.680 --> 2:33:43.840]  other things like the sun and even major weather patterns they'll just feed in a
[2:33:43.840 --> 2:33:51.240]  basic equation of what will happen in you know the co2 is released and then
[2:33:51.240 --> 2:33:56.040]  they have it already built in the computer that co2 will supposedly have
[2:33:56.040 --> 2:34:00.920]  enough of a climate driver to heat things up to make the ice caps melt and
[2:34:00.920 --> 2:34:05.440]  then we're going to be flooded I mean that's an oversimplification or can
[2:34:05.440 --> 2:34:10.640]  you break down how they build these models to show these of this disaster
[2:34:10.640 --> 2:34:16.640]  well what one thing is they confuse the north pole and the south pole the
[2:34:16.640 --> 2:34:21.960]  thing to turn to the thing that determines conditions at the north pole is
[2:34:21.960 --> 2:34:28.720]  primarily ocean currents and for example there was a there was a recent
[2:34:28.720 --> 2:34:35.520]  warming and a whole lot of ice just left in the Arctic sea and then ocean
[2:34:35.520 --> 2:34:41.720]  currents changed and right away it came back it was the fastest rise known and
[2:34:41.720 --> 2:34:48.240]  but the records are short it only goes back to 1979 south pole let me give you
[2:34:48.240 --> 2:34:51.920]  the ski reports from the south pole maybe you have some skiers down there in
[2:34:51.920 --> 2:34:59.480]  Texas the the ski report is two tenths of an inch of new snow and two miles of
[2:34:59.480 --> 2:35:06.600]  base and the the highest temperature ever recorded down there is seven degrees
[2:35:06.600 --> 2:35:13.400]  at the south pole research station the lowest temperature is 117 below now the
[2:35:13.400 --> 2:35:21.520]  last I checked the melting point of ice hasn't changed and so just exactly how
[2:35:21.520 --> 2:35:27.760]  does one presume that the south pole is gonna melt I mean for heaven's sake
[2:35:27.760 --> 2:35:33.400]  well also they do real base things like they will show polar bears on an ice
[2:35:33.400 --> 2:35:38.480]  flow and say oh look they're all going to drowned they don't have a habitat
[2:35:38.480 --> 2:35:43.280]  anymore but just watching shows about polar bears and reading a few books to
[2:35:43.280 --> 2:35:46.920]  my kids over the years I know that they'll swim a hundred miles they get out
[2:35:46.920 --> 2:35:51.840]  on those flows and hunt beluga and hunt seals but the news said they can't swim
[2:35:51.840 --> 2:35:56.320]  their dad global warming did this and I remember reading adventure books history
[2:35:56.320 --> 2:35:59.440]  books about people you know investigating the south and north pole
[2:35:59.440 --> 2:36:03.360]  the Strait of Magellan you know hundreds of years ago and how there were
[2:36:03.360 --> 2:36:07.440]  always giant icebergs the size of cities breaking off I mean that's what
[2:36:07.440 --> 2:36:12.120]  they do it rains it puts more on to the glaciers then they go out to the sea and
[2:36:12.120 --> 2:36:16.480]  break off but but I guess I'm I guess polar bears can't swim and glaciers have
[2:36:16.480 --> 2:36:23.960]  never had icebergs yeah right well you know let me say something about about
[2:36:23.960 --> 2:36:34.160]  the bears they have survived actually very well and for example the polar
[2:36:34.160 --> 2:36:38.800]  bears go back a long long time about a hundred and twenty thousand years ago or
[2:36:38.800 --> 2:36:43.200]  something like that there was another interglacial and it was a good deal
[2:36:43.200 --> 2:36:49.640]  warmer than it is today and there was hardly any ice up anywhere around the
[2:36:49.640 --> 2:36:55.080]  north pole and the polar bear survived that perfectly well at that time I
[2:36:55.080 --> 2:36:59.400]  don't understand why they wouldn't under they wouldn't survive it now and in
[2:36:59.400 --> 2:37:05.040]  fact the the polar bear populations are not decreasing I think there is one
[2:37:05.040 --> 2:37:11.000]  call it tribe of them that's seen some decrease but overall the total polar
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:17.600]  bear population has been either holding steady or steadily or slightly
[2:37:17.600 --> 2:37:21.120]  increasing yeah I saw a press report that they're coming further south and
[2:37:21.120 --> 2:37:25.800]  that their numbers are higher I think it said 25,000 or something he is
[2:37:25.800 --> 2:37:30.200]  something like there's quite a number of and well I mean it's this type of
[2:37:30.200 --> 2:37:32.920]  mindless hype now now since you've really studied what's happening with the
[2:37:32.920 --> 2:37:37.120]  sun and I see so different you know all these different reports but I remember
[2:37:37.120 --> 2:37:41.320]  five six years ago seeing NASA reports about look we can see this moon's
[2:37:41.320 --> 2:37:46.760]  liquid sea of methane is melting due to the sun's increased output can you
[2:37:46.760 --> 2:37:51.600]  specifically get into the sun as a driver or is it the main driver and what
[2:37:51.600 --> 2:37:55.560]  we've seen the solar system and is the sun now cooling according to your
[2:37:55.560 --> 2:38:04.120]  studies as NASA says it is yes the sun is now cooling and the the past 60
[2:38:04.120 --> 2:38:10.760]  years have been the have shown the highest solar activity in the last 1400
[2:38:10.760 --> 2:38:18.400]  years so yes the the the sun is now cooling and has been warmer and we can
[2:38:18.400 --> 2:38:23.480]  expect some cooling but there's also some change in the ocean currents that's
[2:38:23.480 --> 2:38:30.440]  periodic so that there is expected to be some cooling within the next decade or
[2:38:30.440 --> 2:38:37.280]  so and the temperature history also shows that that during the well since
[2:38:37.280 --> 2:38:46.840]  January 2001 the temperature of the earth has basically held almost flat the
[2:38:46.840 --> 2:38:53.840]  it's rising at a 50th of a degree Celsius per decade at the at the present
[2:38:53.840 --> 2:38:57.720]  time now that's just the trend you know you know you can't really predict from
[2:38:57.720 --> 2:39:07.880]  trends but anyway the I guess what I'm trying to say is that the the previous
[2:39:07.880 --> 2:39:15.240]  predictions about the horrendous warming that people expected have not come to
[2:39:15.240 --> 2:39:20.960]  pass it seemed like they were trying to hedge their bet in that day after tomorrow
[2:39:20.960 --> 2:39:25.600]  propaganda film where they explained that global warming means instant freezing
[2:39:25.600 --> 2:39:29.760]  on the destruction of New York by ice and so now they're falling back to that
[2:39:29.760 --> 2:39:35.360]  saying yes it's the global warming now we're all gonna freeze to death is I'm
[2:39:35.360 --> 2:39:41.360]  sure you've heard that newest thing yeah I have the problem with that business is
[2:39:41.360 --> 2:39:47.560]  that when you predict everything you predict nothing you just write down a
[2:39:47.560 --> 2:39:52.160]  list of things that could happen you know that's not a prediction and so it's
[2:39:52.160 --> 2:39:58.000]  it's just pure garbage and no reason to believe any of it you talked about the
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:01.400]  majority of real scientists don't agree with them there's been a big controversy
[2:40:01.400 --> 2:40:05.480]  they had 1800 people sign on as you know I'm telling the audience this UN
[2:40:05.480 --> 2:40:09.840]  document a year or so ago a year and a half ago and now it's come out that a
[2:40:09.840 --> 2:40:13.680]  lot of them were just invited to the conference never even signed on but then
[2:40:13.680 --> 2:40:19.680]  saw their names and then they cult like say there's no disagreement it's a
[2:40:19.680 --> 2:40:24.680]  hundred percent all scientists agree which kind of backfired on because then
[2:40:24.680 --> 2:40:27.480]  they're coming out of the woodwork saying I don't agree I don't agree I mean
[2:40:27.480 --> 2:40:33.480]  again this is bizarre I mean you speak to the real numbers yeah I there were
[2:40:33.480 --> 2:40:40.080]  something like 2,500 people who attended the IPCC gathering in Maui
[2:40:40.080 --> 2:40:47.280]  understand what IPCC stands for if the intergovernmental panel on climate
[2:40:47.280 --> 2:40:54.800]  change and as it turned out there's only about 52 climate scientists among the
[2:40:54.800 --> 2:41:00.880]  whole lot and they among themselves were you know and considerable
[2:41:00.880 --> 2:41:07.680]  disagreement about things and I know of the least one who sued to have his name
[2:41:07.680 --> 2:41:13.560]  taken off that list of people at sign but there's quite another thing that's
[2:41:13.560 --> 2:41:20.880]  going on in independently there is a petition that was run out of Oregon and
[2:41:20.880 --> 2:41:28.240]  they there were 19,000 scientists who signed a statement saying that the
[2:41:28.240 --> 2:41:35.320]  global warming is certainly not proven and the science isn't up to it you know
[2:41:35.320 --> 2:41:44.360]  it's not time to panic and there is another petition that I only know about
[2:41:44.360 --> 2:41:49.320]  sort of through back channels that is has something like 29,000 signatures on
[2:41:49.320 --> 2:41:55.760]  it for people disagree with the with the IPCC scenario and you notice that's
[2:41:55.760 --> 2:42:01.400]  never gonna be in the news it'll never be in the news well what can we do to
[2:42:01.400 --> 2:42:04.640]  turn this around I mean people can get your book give it to other physicists
[2:42:04.640 --> 2:42:08.840]  give it to other climatologists I mean I'm I'm a nobody when it comes to this
[2:42:08.840 --> 2:42:11.200]  but I've read with all the experts are saying and they're saying this is a
[2:42:11.200 --> 2:42:17.280]  fraud why does Al Gore think he's gonna get away with this I mean well the
[2:42:17.280 --> 2:42:23.240]  interesting thing about Al Gore he was invited to speak at a meeting in New
[2:42:23.240 --> 2:42:30.280]  York which was climate skeptics I was one of those skeptics by the way and he
[2:42:30.280 --> 2:42:36.760]  was invited to speak and they said name your price and they know that his price
[2:42:36.760 --> 2:42:42.600]  is usually two hundred thousand dollars per lecture he gets big money out of
[2:42:42.600 --> 2:42:52.480]  this thing and he he refused to speak in front of this group and they said name
[2:42:52.480 --> 2:42:56.000]  your price that he could have named say a million dollars and they they would
[2:42:56.000 --> 2:43:01.440]  have paid it but no no he he does he well he knows he knows he doesn't know
[2:43:01.440 --> 2:43:07.360]  this stuff very well and he knows that in any climate scientist on the planet
[2:43:07.360 --> 2:43:15.760]  can shoot him down because of his errors but so he won't speak but then there was
[2:43:15.760 --> 2:43:21.320]  a me a recent meeting of professional engineers up in Denver this was the
[2:43:21.320 --> 2:43:25.160]  Colorado professional engineers and they decided to have a forum on global
[2:43:25.160 --> 2:43:29.600]  warming and they'd like to hear both sides the issue so they're right there
[2:43:29.600 --> 2:43:36.560]  in Denver near Boulder where NOAA is headquartered and NCAR National Center
[2:43:36.560 --> 2:43:42.720]  for Atmospheric is located and so they said okay let's just find some of these
[2:43:42.720 --> 2:43:49.920]  people that NOAA and NCAR brag or part of this IPCC and have them give a talk
[2:43:49.920 --> 2:43:55.720]  and one of them said that it wouldn't be an appropriate forum now remind you
[2:43:55.720 --> 2:44:02.960]  professional engineers are the are they the elite of engineers and all the rest
[2:44:02.960 --> 2:44:07.560]  of them that they asked found better things to do I'm busy I'm clipping my
[2:44:07.560 --> 2:44:13.680]  toenails that day or something but nobody from there would show up to to
[2:44:13.680 --> 2:44:19.040]  debate some kind of low-level people like myself and I wasn't going to be a
[2:44:19.040 --> 2:44:23.360]  debate well make a presentation and leave if they want to well sir you said
[2:44:23.360 --> 2:44:26.320]  it you realize that the big banks and the big money and they're publicly behind
[2:44:26.320 --> 2:44:30.680]  it we have government documents they want the global taxes and they can't
[2:44:30.680 --> 2:44:35.120]  just come say hey you know big government's good people know it's not
[2:44:35.120 --> 2:44:38.680]  good now they've pretty much woken up to that and so they say okay it's to save
[2:44:38.680 --> 2:44:42.520]  you if you don't do this you're gonna die it's kind of like well the UN has
[2:44:42.520 --> 2:44:48.160]  said they don't want to have war now as a unifying threat so now they want to
[2:44:48.160 --> 2:44:51.800]  have the outside threat of the climate the environment you know the witch
[2:44:51.800 --> 2:44:56.320]  doctors 5,000 years ago would con their tribe into giving them you know special
[2:44:56.320 --> 2:45:00.160]  lifestyles and status because they could predict when a solar eclipse or
[2:45:00.160 --> 2:45:04.560]  lunar was going to happen and really it's the same thing now there it's like
[2:45:04.560 --> 2:45:08.520]  we're a bunch of ignorant savages and they're just telling us ugabuga the sun
[2:45:08.520 --> 2:45:12.880]  won't come back you're gonna die unless you give me all the power I mean can it
[2:45:12.880 --> 2:45:17.920]  from a sociological perspective or really from a from a anthropology view
[2:45:17.920 --> 2:45:22.120]  a doctor be looked at in that way well yeah and I would add another example
[2:45:22.120 --> 2:45:27.360]  perhaps you've experienced this thing on your computer that you've logged on to
[2:45:27.360 --> 2:45:32.000]  some site on the web and then all of a sudden something some pop-up starts
[2:45:32.000 --> 2:45:39.240]  telling you that you've got some virus in your system or something and then
[2:45:39.240 --> 2:45:44.840]  you know you got you got to get some computer program to remove it then
[2:45:44.840 --> 2:45:49.040]  every time you turn around you get this pop-up tell me you have to go get this
[2:45:49.040 --> 2:45:56.320]  stuff to get the junk out of your system well this is what we call extortion
[2:45:56.320 --> 2:46:02.520]  wear yes and and the same thing is happening in the global warming
[2:46:02.520 --> 2:46:09.000]  scenario that people are basically extorting through fear you know you
[2:46:09.000 --> 2:46:14.720]  have to pay us well that's my final point doctor and it's this now I'm
[2:46:14.720 --> 2:46:17.960]  sure you've heard that government heads and others have called for our arrest
[2:46:17.960 --> 2:46:22.960]  they're saying it's like Holocaust denial that if you deny that that there's
[2:46:22.960 --> 2:46:27.040]  global warming and that we need to fix it that you need to be arrested because
[2:46:27.040 --> 2:46:32.360]  it's a crime against humanity well I haven't I haven't heard the arrest part
[2:46:32.360 --> 2:46:40.000]  but I certainly have seen the silencing part oh no no listen you can google that
[2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:43.640]  and and it's all over the British and German news where they're saying that
[2:46:43.640 --> 2:46:48.160]  denying this is like denying the Holocaust and should be illegal yeah
[2:46:48.160 --> 2:46:54.120]  well I look at it this way Al Gore got the Nobel Prize it's the Nobel Peace
[2:46:54.120 --> 2:47:01.240]  Prize which puts him right up there with Yasser Arafat and he refers to people
[2:47:01.240 --> 2:47:05.520]  like us as skeptics and deniers and that puts us right down there with Galileo
[2:47:05.520 --> 2:47:13.440]  thank you absolutely it does move doesn't it well certainly does well we
[2:47:13.440 --> 2:47:19.360]  appreciate you coming on tell us about a couple of the books well I have the
[2:47:19.360 --> 2:47:26.280]  primer on CO2 in climate it's available at baleslake.com and it's available at
[2:47:26.280 --> 2:47:31.960]  Amazon also sales are running high on that and I'll be coming out with a
[2:47:31.960 --> 2:47:37.560]  second issue second edition pretty soon and then another one is called the
[2:47:37.560 --> 2:47:43.200]  solar fraud second edition the subtitle is why solar energy won't run the world
[2:47:43.200 --> 2:47:46.840]  well they're clearly going for broke now I mean they don't care that they've
[2:47:46.840 --> 2:47:51.560]  been shown to be frauds this being one of the coldest winters in modern times
[2:47:51.560 --> 2:47:55.600]  though federal government even admitting that right now globally they're
[2:47:55.600 --> 2:47:58.160]  gonna have trouble spinning this gloom and doom when every one of their
[2:47:58.160 --> 2:48:03.920]  conferences keeps getting blizzarded it out you know actually I look forward to
[2:48:03.920 --> 2:48:08.560]  having this whole thing quiet down and winding up with a bunch of unsolved
[2:48:08.560 --> 2:48:12.760]  books because the thing has gotten out of people's minds and they're just not
[2:48:12.760 --> 2:48:17.480]  excited about it anymore well I think we're starting to turn the corner a
[2:48:17.480 --> 2:48:21.840]  lot of people who believed in it a year ago when they saw the NFL pushing it and
[2:48:21.840 --> 2:48:26.720]  in Bush even saying he was for it now I think you know the massive corporate
[2:48:26.720 --> 2:48:33.000]  push people went wait a minute wait a minute something stinks well yeah I
[2:48:33.000 --> 2:48:38.640]  think so but you have to be eternally visual vigilant because they're they're
[2:48:38.640 --> 2:48:42.640]  always out there and they're after your pocketbook so oh no I agree that the
[2:48:42.640 --> 2:48:46.160]  fight's hot and heavy we're in the thick of the fight I just think that now
[2:48:46.160 --> 2:48:49.760]  people are finally realizing it's a fraud they're not stopping maybe that's
[2:48:49.760 --> 2:48:52.640]  why they're tripling and quadrupling I mean if you see now they're just going
[2:48:52.640 --> 2:48:58.280]  wild do you think that's maybe they're getting desperate or well I think so but
[2:48:58.280 --> 2:49:03.640]  by the way I have written a paper once that was published in nuclear news and
[2:49:03.640 --> 2:49:13.080]  it advised the nuclear industry not to take on this global warming as a as an
[2:49:13.080 --> 2:49:22.400]  argument for nuclear because nuclear has plenty of its own merits and they
[2:49:22.400 --> 2:49:28.680]  should not rest the strong case on weak arguments and I don't know if that had
[2:49:28.680 --> 2:49:33.400]  any influence on the nuclear community but I but I am happy to say that they
[2:49:33.400 --> 2:49:40.600]  have been fairly circumspect about this issue they so you know they they haven't
[2:49:40.600 --> 2:49:47.200]  joined that that bandwagon absolutely all right well thank you so much for
[2:49:47.200 --> 2:49:51.680]  spending a time with us he's Howard C. Hayden a primer on co2 and climate is
[2:49:51.680 --> 2:49:55.160]  his best-selling book right now thanks for spending time with us you're very
[2:49:55.160 --> 2:49:57.840]  welcome thank you you bet there he goes we're gonna come back in the final
[2:49:57.840 --> 2:50:01.280]  segment I know I said I'd take your calls who knows if I can I got some
[2:50:01.280 --> 2:50:06.080]  final news Bob Chapman was gonna pop in but we kind of double booked some guests
[2:50:06.080 --> 2:50:10.760]  the dollar is imploding right now let me before we go to break in the final
[2:50:10.760 --> 2:50:16.000]  segment let me tell you about inner food Ian er food calm it is the best green
[2:50:16.000 --> 2:50:20.920]  food out there the food is so debased it has lost so much of its value even if
[2:50:20.920 --> 2:50:25.400]  it's organic or non-gmo because of the what they've been doing with the crops
