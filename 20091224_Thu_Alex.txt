[00:00.000 --> 00:12.800]  Well, we just did 15 minutes before Christopher Moncton, and I appreciate Jayver Griffin happily
[00:12.800 --> 00:14.120]  letting him cut into his time.
[00:14.120 --> 00:18.680]  Jayver Griffin will be with us under 40 minutes.
[00:18.680 --> 00:23.160]  Then we have another guest from Copenhagen, Denmark joining us, Tom Harris, engineer, executive
[00:23.160 --> 00:27.880]  director of the International Climate Science Coalition, a massive scientific group set
[00:27.880 --> 00:30.880]  up to counter the lies of the UN and the IPCC.
[00:30.880 --> 00:33.520]  But T-minus 40 minutes with Jayver Griffin.
[00:33.520 --> 00:37.280]  Very exciting to hear from Lord Moncton about the victories we're having against the globalist.
[00:37.280 --> 00:39.840]  And now, new world orders admitted everywhere.
[00:39.840 --> 00:41.200]  Global governments admitted.
[00:41.200 --> 00:45.040]  It's admitted the IMF, Private Secretive World Bank, are to keep the money.
[00:45.040 --> 00:48.200]  I mean, this is a route of these criminals.
[00:48.200 --> 00:51.800]  This message from Lord Moncton is most inspiring to me.
[00:51.800 --> 00:55.800]  It isn't often that you can look at the daily news and come up with something that makes
[00:55.800 --> 00:57.360]  you feel good.
[00:57.360 --> 01:02.280]  And I really enjoyed that, and I feel like doubling the effort today.
[01:02.280 --> 01:05.000]  He's quite a warrior, isn't he?
[01:05.000 --> 01:07.720]  And I don't know why I've never heard of him until recently.
[01:07.720 --> 01:11.320]  I guess he's been doing that job over on the other side for quite a while.
[01:11.320 --> 01:12.680]  He's always been traveling around.
[01:12.680 --> 01:13.800]  It's just that it finally hit.
[01:13.800 --> 01:15.920]  The internet age is here.
[01:15.920 --> 01:20.280]  And plus, he was excusing from being frauds 10 years ago.
[01:20.280 --> 01:24.680]  But quickly before we get into meat and potatoes, you also have an event at Bright New Books
[01:24.680 --> 01:25.680]  tonight, right?
[01:25.680 --> 01:26.680]  Yes.
[01:26.680 --> 01:29.480]  And that's just kind of a preview to the seminar on Saturday.
[01:29.480 --> 01:31.520]  Also, I'll be answering a lot of questions.
[01:31.520 --> 01:33.640]  I hope I'll be answering the questions anyway.
[01:33.640 --> 01:35.720]  I'll be getting a lot of them, I know.
[01:35.720 --> 01:39.480]  My intent is to do an update on the creature from Jack-O-Island, which is the title of
[01:39.480 --> 01:44.440]  the book on the Federal Reserve System, and put it into focus in terms of what's happening
[01:44.440 --> 01:46.160]  today in the economy.
[01:46.160 --> 01:50.760]  People want to know, you know, how did the Federal Reserve do this?
[01:50.760 --> 01:51.760]  What are they still doing?
[01:51.760 --> 01:53.040]  What are the plans for the future?
[01:53.040 --> 01:55.320]  I'll be talking about that tonight.
[01:55.320 --> 01:56.880]  And that's at 7 o'clock?
[01:56.880 --> 01:57.880]  7 o'clock.
[01:57.880 --> 02:01.920]  And that's down on Guadaloupe Street at www.bravenewbooks.com.
[02:01.920 --> 02:05.360]  Or people can find out all the details at one of your great websites.
[02:05.360 --> 02:08.000]  It'll be www.realityzone.com.
[02:08.000 --> 02:11.480]  And find out about the hotel event and how to get tickets to that for Saturday.
[02:11.480 --> 02:12.720]  Yeah, that would be great.
[02:12.720 --> 02:15.000]  It is not too late, folks, to get into that.
[02:15.000 --> 02:16.000]  Right.
[02:16.000 --> 02:17.000]  We expect a good crowd.
[02:17.000 --> 02:19.960]  So, the earlier the reservation is made, the better off it'll be.
[02:19.960 --> 02:20.960]  Yeah.
[02:20.960 --> 02:21.960]  And you're powerful on the stage.
[02:21.960 --> 02:22.960]  I mean, you're powerful in person, too.
[02:22.960 --> 02:26.960]  On my second time at Avignon Studio, but you're really powerful up there giving a speech.
[02:26.960 --> 02:27.960]  Well, thank you.
[02:27.960 --> 02:32.240]  I enjoy doing it, and I have a message that I feel very passionate about.
[02:32.240 --> 02:36.520]  So I guess I just worry about the message and forget about the speech.
[02:36.520 --> 02:40.240]  You know, every time you're on, I get all these emails from women who just love your
[02:40.240 --> 02:41.240]  voice.
[02:41.240 --> 02:42.240]  Oh, really?
[02:42.240 --> 02:43.240]  Why don't they send me the emails?
[02:43.240 --> 02:48.240]  That's the way it works.
[02:48.240 --> 02:58.760]  Oh, my goodness, but getting into banking, 311 co-sponsors, it's passed the House Committee.
[02:58.760 --> 03:00.120]  It looks like it's going to pass the House.
[03:00.120 --> 03:03.280]  The Senate may block it, but that's putting off the inevitable.
[03:03.280 --> 03:06.680]  People have finally gone past the left and right, the two parties, to the real power
[03:06.680 --> 03:09.960]  structure, the bankers that you've been fighting for 40 years.
[03:09.960 --> 03:10.960]  Right.
[03:10.960 --> 03:13.680]  You're talking about the proposed bill to audit the Fed?
[03:13.680 --> 03:14.680]  Yes.
[03:14.680 --> 03:16.120]  I'd like to comment on that.
[03:16.120 --> 03:22.240]  I support that, of course, but I have some misgivings, which I'll mention for a moment,
[03:22.240 --> 03:24.400]  and then come back to my support statement.
[03:24.400 --> 03:29.200]  When I wrote the book, it was published in 1994, I had a little paragraph or two about
[03:29.200 --> 03:34.800]  the audit the Fed bill, which in those days was routinely sponsored by Congressman Gonzalez.
[03:34.800 --> 03:38.120]  And I commented, then I said, you know, we don't need to audit the Fed.
[03:38.120 --> 03:40.640]  What we need to do is abolish the Fed.
[03:40.640 --> 03:46.160]  And I complained then, I predicted then, that if we ever had a serious move to audit the
[03:46.160 --> 03:51.480]  Fed, that it probably would be an instrument by which politicians would make a big grandstand.
[03:51.480 --> 03:54.160]  They would say, we're going to do something about this Federal Reserve.
[03:54.160 --> 03:55.840]  We're going to audit the Fed.
[03:55.840 --> 03:59.680]  But in fact, if they did an audit, I think they'll find that for the most part, the Fed
[03:59.680 --> 04:01.160]  is not doing anything illegal.
[04:01.160 --> 04:02.160]  It's a holding company.
[04:02.160 --> 04:03.160]  It's a holding company.
[04:03.160 --> 04:04.160]  It's a cartel.
[04:04.160 --> 04:05.840]  It's doing what it's supposed to do.
[04:05.840 --> 04:09.520]  And it would drag on for a couple of years while people had the false impression that
[04:09.520 --> 04:10.520]  something was being...
[04:10.520 --> 04:13.160]  Your attack is on the institution and the system itself.
[04:13.160 --> 04:14.720]  The system itself.
[04:14.720 --> 04:18.240]  And so I said, you know, do we need to audit the mafia?
[04:18.240 --> 04:19.240]  No.
[04:19.240 --> 04:22.400]  We need to get, you know, get rid of the mafia if we could.
[04:22.400 --> 04:24.880]  And I feel the same thing is true with the Federal Reserve.
[04:24.880 --> 04:28.240]  But it has been audits that brought down Al Capone, and that's Ron Paul's view, is it
[04:28.240 --> 04:29.560]  will put it out there.
[04:29.560 --> 04:32.120]  His fight against them is identifying them as the enemy.
[04:32.120 --> 04:34.840]  Some polls show 81% of Americans want to abolish it.
[04:34.840 --> 04:35.840]  Yeah.
[04:35.840 --> 04:36.840]  Well, now I come back to my opening.
[04:36.840 --> 04:37.840]  Well, stay there.
[04:37.840 --> 04:38.840]  We got a break.
[04:38.840 --> 04:39.840]  Come back with your positive point.
[04:39.840 --> 04:42.840]  And let's get more into Man Bear Pig.
[04:42.840 --> 04:43.840]  Yeah.
[04:43.840 --> 04:45.840]  Do you know about the Man Bear Pig?
[04:45.840 --> 04:46.840]  No.
[04:46.840 --> 04:47.840]  Tell me.
[04:47.840 --> 04:50.120]  I'll tell you about Al Gore and the Man Bear Pig when we get back.
[04:50.120 --> 04:53.040]  G. Edward Griffin is our guest in studio.
[04:53.040 --> 04:55.960]  This is the one, the only GCN radio network.
[04:55.960 --> 05:00.320]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com, baby.
[05:00.320 --> 05:04.960]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[05:04.960 --> 05:05.960]  you to eat.
[05:05.960 --> 05:10.160]  To continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick, go
[05:10.160 --> 05:14.080]  to the doctor and buy their drugs, you don't have to cooperate.
[05:14.080 --> 05:15.400]  There is a solution.
[05:15.400 --> 05:18.960]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing
[05:18.960 --> 05:23.800]  products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[05:23.800 --> 05:28.920]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the

[05:36.440 --> 05:37.440]  manager.
[05:37.440 --> 05:42.080]  I love their Nutric Cafe, great organic coffee, infused with herbal extracts to boost your
[05:42.080 --> 05:43.280]  immune system.

[06:00.200 --> 06:04.880]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[06:04.880 --> 06:09.160]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[06:09.160 --> 06:13.520]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[06:13.520 --> 06:14.840]  allows you to have.
[06:14.840 --> 06:20.520]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[06:20.520 --> 06:24.880]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[06:24.880 --> 06:28.880]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[06:28.880 --> 06:32.360]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[06:32.360 --> 06:36.080]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[06:36.080 --> 06:40.800]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[06:40.800 --> 06:44.600]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[06:44.600 --> 06:45.960]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[06:45.960 --> 06:50.200]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[06:58.840 --> 07:03.640]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[07:03.640 --> 07:08.000]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[07:08.000 --> 07:09.000]  do you want?
[07:09.000 --> 07:11.000]  My answer would be all I can get.
[07:11.000 --> 07:16.040]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[07:16.040 --> 07:17.280]  How much do you want?
[07:17.280 --> 07:18.360]  When do you want it?
[07:18.360 --> 07:20.280]  Now or after the battle starts?
[07:20.280 --> 07:21.440]  When will you need it?
[07:21.440 --> 07:23.560]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[07:23.560 --> 07:24.880]  Will there be any food?
[07:24.880 --> 07:26.360]  Will it make your children sick?
[07:26.360 --> 07:30.480]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[07:30.480 --> 07:31.640]  and be immunized?
[07:31.640 --> 07:35.400]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[07:35.400 --> 07:39.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[07:39.000 --> 07:40.240]  How much will you need?
[07:40.240 --> 07:41.240]  We don't know.
[07:41.240 --> 07:42.240]  How much do you want?
[07:42.240 --> 07:43.240]  All you can get.
[07:43.240 --> 07:44.240]  I'm Alex Jones.
[07:44.240 --> 07:47.480]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[07:47.480 --> 07:54.960]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[07:54.960 --> 08:01.920]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[08:01.920 --> 08:04.600]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[08:04.600 --> 08:10.280]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:10.280 --> 08:21.080]  No, G. Edward the Man Bear Pig is a South Park episode where they make fun of Al Gore
[08:21.080 --> 08:22.080]  for fair mongering.
[08:22.080 --> 08:25.200]  He says there's a mythical creature in the woods that's going to kill the town if they
[08:25.200 --> 08:26.720]  don't give him a bunch of money.
[08:26.720 --> 08:31.960]  And it's a half man, half bear, half pig, which of course is 150%.
[08:31.960 --> 08:34.280]  And it's just totally ridiculous.
[08:34.280 --> 08:39.760]  Later we'll play a clip of that and we can find it on YouTube or elsewhere.
[08:39.760 --> 08:43.680]  But getting into the positive part about auditing the Fed.
[08:43.680 --> 08:48.080]  Yeah, I think it's a very positive thing because for the first time people are hearing
[08:48.080 --> 08:51.960]  about the Federal Reserve and they're hearing about it in a way that causes them to think
[08:51.960 --> 08:54.040]  that maybe something's wrong.
[08:54.040 --> 08:58.840]  Most people have never given a thought to this institution and when they do think about
[08:58.840 --> 09:01.720]  it they think it's a great government agency of some kind.
[09:01.720 --> 09:03.640]  So now they're hearing audit the Fed.
[09:03.640 --> 09:04.640]  What does that mean?
[09:04.640 --> 09:06.320]  Why does someone want to audit the Fed?
[09:06.320 --> 09:11.320]  So the reason I support it is because it's causing millions of Americans to realize that
[09:11.320 --> 09:14.960]  there's something fishy with the Federal Reserve system and that's a big step forward.
[09:14.960 --> 09:19.040]  I want to get back into the Federal Reserve but obviously the big issue is the public
[09:19.040 --> 09:23.760]  announcement of world government, the public announcement that it is to be funded by taxes
[09:23.760 --> 09:30.480]  on everything, a UN directorate over energy, taxation, 2% tax off the top of all countries
[09:30.480 --> 09:38.040]  GDP, a police grid over all air traffic, taxes on that, taxes on food, taxes on fuel.
[09:38.040 --> 09:45.160]  Why do you think they're moving, throwing everything at us at once, A, and B, are they
[09:45.160 --> 09:49.400]  accelerating their program because they're behind?
[09:49.400 --> 09:50.920]  Well two questions.
[09:50.920 --> 09:55.600]  I think that the reason they're throwing everything at us at once now is because we're coming
[09:55.600 --> 09:57.120]  very close to the finish line.
[09:57.120 --> 10:01.160]  I mean there's much more to do and they're just trying to tie it all up as quickly as
[10:01.160 --> 10:04.760]  possible certainly within the next 10 years I would say.
[10:04.760 --> 10:10.600]  So it's come time to button everything down and you can't kid about it anymore when you're
[10:10.600 --> 10:11.600]  trying to tie everything down.
[10:11.600 --> 10:13.880]  You have to call it exactly what it is.
[10:13.880 --> 10:18.560]  I don't know if they're accelerating their program or whether it's just like a natural
[10:18.560 --> 10:23.960]  phenomenon when a candle burns brightly, it means it's about ready to burn out you know.
[10:23.960 --> 10:28.760]  So I think it's accelerated but whether they've planned it to be that way or not, I wouldn't
[10:28.760 --> 10:32.440]  have any way of knowing.
[10:32.440 --> 10:39.440]  But why would they go from admitting that they're doing, I mean denying what they were
[10:39.440 --> 10:42.600]  doing to admitting what they're doing, I mean doesn't that hurt them to say there's
[10:42.600 --> 10:47.080]  no world government, there's no carbon tax plan just two, three years ago to yeah there's
[10:47.080 --> 10:51.000]  a world government, it's going to save Africans by cutting off their power.
[10:51.000 --> 10:55.560]  Well I think the answer to that Alex is that if they had said yes we're building world
[10:55.560 --> 11:00.280]  government, they'd said that three, four, five years ago people would have been shocked,
[11:00.280 --> 11:03.480]  they would have been outraged, they would have said who wants world government.
[11:03.480 --> 11:06.380]  But now there's enough crisis going on in the world.
[11:06.380 --> 11:10.440]  People are frightened of so many things that now they can say yeah there's world government
[11:10.440 --> 11:14.200]  and it's the solution to all of your problems everybody.
[11:14.200 --> 11:19.160]  So see how fortunate you are that we've got this masterful plan to save you.
[11:19.160 --> 11:23.680]  So I think now they're talking about world government because finally they can present
[11:23.680 --> 11:28.960]  it as a so-called solution to all of the problems that are infecting the planet.
[11:28.960 --> 11:35.240]  And in the Copenhagen climate summit in Dissaray after Danish text leak of the official treaty
[11:35.240 --> 11:38.560]  that they want to get people to sign, they didn't mean to bring this out until the last
[11:38.560 --> 11:42.520]  few days, get the third world all thinking they were going to get to loot the west because
[11:42.520 --> 11:44.760]  they're playing groups off against each other.
[11:44.760 --> 11:49.520]  And now they find out oh the IMF and World Bank will have all the power, not the UN.
[11:49.520 --> 11:54.520]  And this tax money will be doled out to you if you reduce your population and set up a
[11:54.520 --> 11:56.760]  global one child policy.
[11:56.760 --> 11:59.360]  So everything is coming out in the open.
[11:59.360 --> 12:01.520]  People would laugh at end game three years ago.
[12:01.520 --> 12:04.320]  They're not laughing now.
[12:04.320 --> 12:09.680]  And so the IMF World Bank, these are arms of the same private central banking system
[12:09.680 --> 12:10.680]  that we live under.
[12:10.680 --> 12:11.680]  That's right.
[12:11.680 --> 12:14.360]  That has always been the source of the ultimate power.
[12:14.360 --> 12:17.960]  Certainly here in the United States, people are beginning to finally to understand that
[12:17.960 --> 12:20.640]  the power is with the banks, not with the government.
[12:20.640 --> 12:25.360]  That the government supposedly was to control the banks, but we can see in the recent events
[12:25.360 --> 12:29.680]  in Washington when all of this money is created out of nothing and it goes to the banks and
[12:29.680 --> 12:34.480]  the congressmen dutifully vote for it without even understanding what the bills are.
[12:34.480 --> 12:36.120]  They never ask any questions.
[12:36.120 --> 12:37.600]  They never even read the bills.
[12:37.600 --> 12:38.920]  They just dutifully vote for it.
[12:38.920 --> 12:42.920]  I think anybody can see now that it's the banks that are running the show and not the
[12:42.920 --> 12:43.920]  government.
[12:43.920 --> 12:46.080]  So there will be no difference at the international level.
[12:46.080 --> 12:50.200]  It is coming out in the open that the IMF and the World Bank will be the center of authority
[12:50.200 --> 12:51.600]  and power.
[12:51.600 --> 12:55.600]  But the banks want to create a new global government structure because there's no Bill
[12:55.600 --> 12:56.600]  of Rights.
[12:56.600 --> 12:57.600]  There's no Constitution.
[12:57.600 --> 12:59.200]  There's no Declaration of Independence.
[12:59.200 --> 13:04.040]  It's just pure, even the Guardian admits, secret world government run by private corporate
[13:04.040 --> 13:05.040]  interests.
[13:05.040 --> 13:10.320]  It actually says that in the text and now the London Guardian is talking like G. Edward
[13:10.320 --> 13:11.320]  Griffin.
[13:11.320 --> 13:12.320]  This is incredible.
[13:12.320 --> 13:13.320]  Yes, it is.
[13:13.320 --> 13:17.600]  Well, the fact of the matter is they do have documents that appear like they're the Bill
[13:17.600 --> 13:18.600]  of Rights.
[13:18.600 --> 13:22.400]  I mean, they do have the Covenant on Human Rights that's published there at the United
[13:22.400 --> 13:23.400]  Nations.
[13:23.400 --> 13:24.400]  They have conferences on it.
[13:24.400 --> 13:28.400]  The United Nations, the unanimous Declaration of Human Rights, 30 points, but in 29 and 30,
[13:28.400 --> 13:32.000]  all the rights given are privileges that you and can revoke.
[13:32.000 --> 13:33.000]  Yes.
[13:33.000 --> 13:36.200]  And not, you don't have to wait until you get to the 29th and the 30th one.
[13:36.200 --> 13:40.280]  Every one of them along the way says, for example, everyone has the right to freedom
[13:40.280 --> 13:45.440]  of speech, except as may be provided for by law.
[13:45.440 --> 13:49.480]  Everyone has the right to employment or the right to travel.
[13:49.480 --> 13:51.680]  Everyone has the right to freedom of religion.
[13:51.680 --> 13:56.600]  Everyone has, you know, all these rights, but in every condition and every provision,
[13:56.600 --> 14:01.680]  they say except as may be provided for by law, which means you've got these rights until
[14:01.680 --> 14:05.120]  they pass a law and take them away from you, which means you never had them in the first
[14:05.120 --> 14:06.120]  place.
[14:06.120 --> 14:08.400]  Well said.
[14:08.400 --> 14:12.640]  On the subject of the private Federal Reserve, the holding company, the private banks that
[14:12.640 --> 14:19.040]  own and control it, they have stolen trillions of dollars.
[14:19.040 --> 14:20.920]  They won't say where it's gone.
[14:20.920 --> 14:24.720]  How do you see this unfolding?
[14:24.720 --> 14:26.880]  That's a tough question.
[14:26.880 --> 14:30.960]  I'm taking a moment to think about it because I don't think the mechanisms are in place
[14:30.960 --> 14:35.880]  right now for the will of the people to have much effect.
[14:35.880 --> 14:41.200]  The government of the United States is firmly in the hands of collectivists who are beholden
[14:41.200 --> 14:44.480]  to this financial global power.
[14:44.480 --> 14:50.760]  And they care what the American voters think, but not as much as you might suspect that
[14:50.760 --> 14:51.760]  they do.
[14:51.760 --> 14:55.240]  They don't care so much about people who write them letters as they do about people
[14:55.240 --> 14:57.400]  who write them checks.
[14:57.400 --> 15:03.560]  And so I think when the public becomes upset by this and starts to demand change as they're
[15:03.560 --> 15:08.160]  now doing, the politicians are maneuvering and thinking not in terms of how we're going
[15:08.160 --> 15:13.040]  to bring about the change, but how we continue doing exactly what we have been doing and
[15:13.040 --> 15:18.360]  to shut the public out of the debate and to just proceed in spite of the public opposition
[15:18.360 --> 15:19.680]  and concern.
[15:19.680 --> 15:27.400]  So to answer your question, I see an increasing pressure for genuine rebellion in this country
[15:27.400 --> 15:31.200]  which scares the dickens out of me because I don't think that would be a good thing.
[15:31.200 --> 15:33.520]  And we've seen the elite preparing for that.
[15:33.520 --> 15:38.160]  Preparing for it and I think hoping for it because they know that if there is widespread
[15:38.160 --> 15:44.440]  civil violence, that will be the excuse they really want in order to clamp down with martial
[15:44.440 --> 15:45.440]  law.
[15:45.440 --> 15:46.600]  That's why they've got North Commonplace.
[15:46.600 --> 15:47.600]  Exactly, yeah.
[15:47.600 --> 15:51.880]  So I worry a lot about that, but you asked me the question, where do I think it's going?
[15:51.880 --> 15:56.320]  I think that's probably where it's going to go and I hope we can reach enough people
[15:56.320 --> 16:00.200]  soon enough to prevent that from happening.
[16:00.200 --> 16:03.640]  Obviously educating people is a big part of the solution and we're doing that.
[16:03.640 --> 16:07.400]  But at the same time, as you said, running for city council, county commissioner, school
[16:07.400 --> 16:12.920]  board, we need to start getting into the power structure at the grassroots and start moving
[16:12.920 --> 16:14.920]  into the federal government as well.
[16:14.920 --> 16:17.920]  The globalists have the long view, that's why they've been successful.
[16:17.920 --> 16:21.520]  We need to have the long view, speak to that and freedom force international.
[16:21.520 --> 16:22.840]  Oh, thanks for that.
[16:22.840 --> 16:26.960]  That is the mantra that I have been preaching for so many years.
[16:26.960 --> 16:32.640]  Most Americans have a very short attention span and they have a very short view of the
[16:32.640 --> 16:33.920]  future.
[16:33.920 --> 16:39.720]  And even those who are greatly concerned about what's happening in America today want a solution
[16:39.720 --> 16:44.240]  that they think will happen within the next election.
[16:44.240 --> 16:47.120]  And we do it by the next election and if we can't do it in the next election, they're
[16:47.120 --> 16:48.120]  not interested.
[16:48.120 --> 16:51.800]  Well, I'm here to say it's not going to happen in the next election or probably not even
[16:51.800 --> 16:52.800]  the one after that.
[16:52.800 --> 16:53.800]  Because they give us a bush.
[16:53.800 --> 16:55.000]  They give us an Obama.
[16:55.000 --> 16:58.600]  Same policies, different rhetoric and just the Ropetope continues.
[16:58.600 --> 17:04.760]  As long as we're committed to this scam between the Republican and the Democrat party, which
[17:04.760 --> 17:09.880]  appears to be offering people a choice when in fact it's not, it's a rigged wrestling
[17:09.880 --> 17:10.880]  match.
[17:10.880 --> 17:15.360]  And those people buy into that Republican Democrat nonsense.
[17:15.360 --> 17:17.680]  There is no hope of changing the system.
[17:17.680 --> 17:22.000]  So that's where education comes in and it's also where the freedom force strategy comes
[17:22.000 --> 17:28.640]  in where we want people who are aware of this to go into government, to try and become influential
[17:28.640 --> 17:29.880]  in their own government.
[17:29.880 --> 17:34.120]  Instead of just standing on the outside of the halls of power looking in and writing
[17:34.120 --> 17:39.160]  letters of complaint and petition, we want them to organize and to run for office.
[17:39.160 --> 17:42.960]  And then even if they're in low positions, they will gather support by the grassroots,
[17:42.960 --> 17:44.600]  be propelled into higher positions.
[17:44.600 --> 17:49.120]  They can leak documents, they can whistle blow, they can bully pulpit, they can sabotage
[17:49.120 --> 17:50.480]  globalist operations.
[17:50.480 --> 17:52.160]  You have to be on the inside.
[17:52.160 --> 17:53.840]  I think it's the only solution.
[17:53.840 --> 17:57.040]  It's how our collectivist enemies took over this country.
[17:57.040 --> 17:58.560]  They didn't attack from the outside.
[17:58.560 --> 18:02.960]  They didn't send soldiers in wearing uniforms of a different color and different insignia.
[18:02.960 --> 18:04.920]  They didn't use bombs and bayonets.
[18:04.920 --> 18:09.860]  They took over the power centers of society one by one from right inside the country.
[18:09.860 --> 18:11.360]  And that's the only way we can reverse it.
[18:11.360 --> 18:16.880]  Cicero, one of the Roman historians talked about, the enemy at the gates with their flag
[18:16.880 --> 18:18.440]  openly is not the threat.
[18:18.440 --> 18:19.640]  It's the enemy from within.
[18:19.640 --> 18:20.640]  Yes, so true.
[18:20.640 --> 18:22.840]  But we are the cure from within.
[18:22.840 --> 18:24.480]  The cure is from within too.
[18:24.480 --> 18:26.720]  So that's what freedom force is all about.
[18:26.720 --> 18:28.440]  We have the long view of history.
[18:28.440 --> 18:32.920]  We think that this can be turned around, but not by the next election.
[18:32.920 --> 18:37.200]  So it's a kind of a pessimistic view and an optimistic view at the same time.
[18:37.200 --> 18:41.680]  It's pessimistic in the sense that we'd all like to see a return to normalcy and prosperity
[18:41.680 --> 18:43.120]  and safety and all of that.
[18:43.120 --> 18:47.400]  We'd like to see that happen real fast, but it's not going to happen real fast.
[18:47.400 --> 18:52.720]  But the optimistic point is that if we lay the foundation today, if we get people to
[18:52.720 --> 18:57.000]  understand the basic principles of freedom and if we get them organized and networked
[18:57.000 --> 19:02.360]  together so they can go into the power centers of society, including the political parties,
[19:02.360 --> 19:05.120]  but also the church organizations, the schools.
[19:05.120 --> 19:06.120]  That's what FEMA's doing.
[19:06.120 --> 19:09.600]  They're doing what we should be doing, quietly taking over.
[19:09.600 --> 19:13.040]  The U.N. document came out last week where over a decade ago they took over the public
[19:13.040 --> 19:18.280]  schools locally, brainwashing the kids, but it's not pessimistic.
[19:18.280 --> 19:19.280]  It's honest.
[19:19.280 --> 19:24.000]  What's pessimistic is people wanting an instant solution, a silver bullet, it's got to happen
[19:24.000 --> 19:25.000]  today.
[19:25.000 --> 19:26.680]  No, resistance is victory.
[19:26.680 --> 19:28.280]  The truth is victory.
[19:28.280 --> 19:29.280]  Taking action.
[19:29.280 --> 19:30.280]  I've been doing this 14 years.
[19:30.280 --> 19:32.200]  You've been doing this 40 plus years.
[19:32.200 --> 19:36.760]  It's just the process of like a woodpecker, always attacking, always educating, always
[19:36.760 --> 19:37.760]  resisting.
[19:37.760 --> 19:42.040]  Over time it builds an exponential force that is unstoppable that people are like, well,
[19:42.040 --> 19:46.120]  I went out and protested once, or I went to city council once, or I tried to run and didn't
[19:46.120 --> 19:48.520]  win once, but so did Ron Paul.
[19:48.520 --> 19:53.360]  It's all a process and we have to realize that they're trying to bend our will.
[19:53.360 --> 19:57.680]  We've got to push and bend right back because it's when you don't give up and keep pushing
[19:57.680 --> 19:59.320]  that you're an unstoppable force.
[19:59.320 --> 20:02.720]  We ever grieve and stay with us, we'll be right back.
[20:02.720 --> 20:03.720]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[20:03.720 --> 20:04.720]  Say no to toxic overloads.
[20:04.720 --> 20:05.720]  Say no to chemicals.
[20:05.720 --> 20:07.500]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[20:07.500 --> 20:11.440]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory
[20:11.440 --> 20:16.520]  loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[20:16.520 --> 20:20.320]  Chemical free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger
[20:20.320 --> 20:21.680]  to fight off viruses.
[20:21.680 --> 20:23.680]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[20:23.680 --> 20:28.320]  Liquid zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting
[20:28.320 --> 20:31.120]  energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.
[20:31.120 --> 20:34.760]  Liquid zeolite is tasteless, odorless, and so gentle you won't even know you're taking
[20:34.760 --> 20:35.760]  it.
[20:35.760 --> 20:38.040]  Feel great again and as little as three days to three weeks.
[20:38.040 --> 20:42.880]  Liquid zeolite comes with a money back guarantee, but it's only available at RestoreYourHealthNow.com.

[21:02.320 --> 21:06.040]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[21:06.040 --> 21:09.200]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[21:09.200 --> 21:13.520]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[21:13.520 --> 21:14.520]  at home.
[21:14.520 --> 21:19.680]  I have a tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the
[21:19.680 --> 21:20.680]  shots.
[21:20.680 --> 21:25.480]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[21:25.480 --> 21:31.000]  The fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[21:31.000 --> 21:35.680]  held bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[21:35.680 --> 21:38.080]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[21:38.080 --> 21:42.200]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[21:42.200 --> 21:48.080]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[21:48.080 --> 21:49.440]  of the Republic.

[21:56.000 --> 22:00.880]  in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[22:00.880 --> 22:05.840]  Originally we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency to ensure purity,
[22:05.840 --> 22:10.660]  content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[22:10.660 --> 22:15.560]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being
[22:15.560 --> 22:20.640]  lost with time, the government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with
[22:20.640 --> 22:26.280]  private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[22:26.280 --> 22:30.240]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our
[22:30.240 --> 22:34.600]  elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original
[22:34.600 --> 22:35.600]  value.
[22:35.600 --> 22:40.040]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[22:40.040 --> 22:41.680]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[22:41.680 --> 22:44.720]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.

[23:03.240 --> 23:05.400]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[23:05.400 --> 23:09.640]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.

[24:21.800 --> 24:31.580]  All right, we've got this segment and part of the next, and then we've got a guest joining
[24:31.580 --> 24:36.560]  us from Copenhagen in the last 20 minutes of this transmission.
[24:36.560 --> 24:39.240]  G. Edward Griffin is in studio with us.
[24:39.240 --> 24:44.200]  He's going to be speaking at Brave New Books tonight in Austin, Texas at 7 p.m.
[24:44.200 --> 24:49.680]  And then at the Courtyard Austin Downtown Convention Center 300 East 4th Street, Austin,
[24:49.680 --> 24:56.960]  Texas 787-01, 512-236-8008, Saturday, December 12th.
[24:56.960 --> 25:01.160]  The registration begins at 8.30 a.m. because you don't need to go through the registration.
[25:01.160 --> 25:05.920]  You can come at 8.30 for coffee and pastries or get there at 9.30 as Mr. Griffin starts
[25:05.920 --> 25:07.680]  his presentation at 9.45.
[25:07.680 --> 25:10.560]  Don't want to miss that Saturday in Austin, Texas.
[25:10.560 --> 25:12.960]  Okay, we're getting in a long view of history.
[25:12.960 --> 25:16.280]  I think these victories against the Federal Reserve, though, exposing them, their polling
[25:16.280 --> 25:23.320]  numbers going down to less than 20%, the environmentalist being unmasked, his private corporate takeover
[25:23.320 --> 25:24.320]  artist.
[25:24.320 --> 25:27.640]  All of this is showing the people, though, that we can have victory.
[25:27.640 --> 25:30.520]  I mean, I'm seeing the morale go up.
[25:30.520 --> 25:35.160]  Being a public figure, I get off airplanes in Latin America, Canada, the towns all over
[25:35.160 --> 25:39.080]  the U.S., and literally, cars stop as I walk down the street, people everywhere.
[25:39.080 --> 25:40.240]  And I'm just one guy.
[25:40.240 --> 25:41.240]  And it's getting insane.
[25:41.240 --> 25:45.160]  I mean, it's like I've got a major sitcom on television or something.
[25:45.160 --> 25:49.040]  I mean, I'll be out with Charlie Sheen on the streets of Los Angeles, and people running
[25:49.040 --> 25:50.280]  up to him and running up to me.
[25:50.280 --> 25:51.600]  I mean, it just, it's happening.
[25:51.600 --> 25:57.080]  I mean, really, that's a sonar ping that it's bigger than we think, G. Edward.
[25:57.080 --> 25:58.080]  Yeah.
[25:58.080 --> 25:59.080]  Well, I'm glad to hear that.
[25:59.080 --> 26:06.720]  And of course, the theme that I focus on is that the long view of history is very, very
[26:06.720 --> 26:08.600]  comforting, at least to someone at my age.
[26:08.600 --> 26:10.120]  I don't know a younger person.
[26:10.120 --> 26:14.280]  I remember when I was a lot younger, I was in a bigger hurry, a bigger hurry than I am
[26:14.280 --> 26:15.280]  now.
[26:15.280 --> 26:22.240]  But it's comforting to know that you and I are putting in place principles and organizational
[26:22.240 --> 26:26.040]  structures and strategies that cannot be stamped out.
[26:26.040 --> 26:29.520]  I don't care how strong the engines of tyranny are.
[26:29.520 --> 26:34.800]  They cannot overpower the force of the knowledge and the principles that we're building right
[26:34.800 --> 26:35.800]  now.
[26:35.800 --> 26:39.760]  And that is going to, it's going to build through the next generation.
[26:39.760 --> 26:45.000]  And I think the following generation after that, it sounds like a far distance down the
[26:45.000 --> 26:46.520]  road, but it's not that far.
[26:46.520 --> 26:50.400]  I think we're going to see this whole thing turn around within that length of period.
[26:50.400 --> 26:51.400]  And that's very comforting.
[26:51.400 --> 26:54.720]  I can go to bed at night and really sleep well thinking that I have a part.
[26:54.720 --> 26:59.200]  But they are racing to put the technocracy in place, but that we told the truth, had
[26:59.200 --> 27:05.200]  a testament of who the bad guys were and what, and what liberty could be those seeds, billions
[27:05.200 --> 27:09.720]  of them have been planted, millions of sprouted, but tyranny is almost like water and sunlight
[27:09.720 --> 27:10.720]  to liberty.
[27:10.720 --> 27:15.080]  It, when it comes in for every action, there's an equal reaction.
[27:15.080 --> 27:16.360]  I agree with that.
[27:16.360 --> 27:23.320]  And that, I guess we could say it's fortunate that we live in these tumultuous times, even
[27:23.320 --> 27:27.360]  though it may be rather hectic for us still.
[27:27.360 --> 27:32.120]  If we didn't have all the problems we have today, people would still be asleep.
[27:32.120 --> 27:36.000]  They wouldn't be thinking about the ingredients of freedom.
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.400]  They wouldn't be thinking about what it takes to be free.
[27:38.400 --> 27:40.480]  They wouldn't be thinking about our heritage.
[27:40.480 --> 27:44.360]  They wouldn't be thinking about economic issues that there was a choice.
[27:44.360 --> 27:45.360]  Another option.
[27:45.360 --> 27:46.360]  Yeah.
[27:46.360 --> 27:47.600]  Because everything was comfortable.
[27:47.600 --> 27:49.520]  Everything was easy, you know?
[27:49.520 --> 27:55.240]  So if we want to put in place something that's going to have this long view, we need a lot
[27:55.240 --> 27:56.480]  of help, a lot of support.
[27:56.480 --> 27:58.760]  That means we need to wake up a lot of people.
[27:58.760 --> 28:04.920]  So in that sense, this growing tyranny is our ally, but we still have to stamp it out.
[28:04.920 --> 28:06.000]  We're not going to let it grow.
[28:06.000 --> 28:07.000]  That's for sure.
[28:07.000 --> 28:10.920]  And we have to make sure the enemy doesn't plant counterfeits out there to misdirect
[28:10.920 --> 28:11.920]  people.
[28:11.920 --> 28:17.320]  The globalists are masters of creating infighting with people that don't like the system.
[28:17.320 --> 28:19.640]  We need to really not spend time on that.
[28:19.640 --> 28:20.640]  That's right.
[28:20.640 --> 28:21.920]  Yeah, we know that they're doing that.
[28:21.920 --> 28:28.080]  That's a favorite strategy, and we've seen it all throughout history.
[28:28.080 --> 28:32.160]  I know a little bit about the Federal Reserve System, and the first time I came across that
[28:32.160 --> 28:36.840]  strategy in the economic field was in the evolution and the origin of the Federal Reserve.
[28:36.840 --> 28:42.640]  The very people that conceived the Federal Reserve, then having got it proposed and an
[28:42.640 --> 28:48.160]  actual bill going before Congress, then they started to lead the opposition against it
[28:48.160 --> 28:50.720]  in such a way that it was bound to fail.
[28:50.720 --> 28:52.120]  You see what I'm saying?
[28:52.120 --> 28:55.920]  If you lead your own opposition, then you can make sure that it will fail.
[28:55.920 --> 28:59.880]  Well, there was more to the trick, and I know you know this, but why don't you elaborate?
[28:59.880 --> 29:04.960]  They came out and acted like they were the bankers and said, we don't want this.
[29:04.960 --> 29:07.080]  Please don't throw me in the briar patch.
[29:07.080 --> 29:08.080]  Right.
[29:08.080 --> 29:10.400]  Yeah, they said this Federal Reserve bill is not good for business.
[29:10.400 --> 29:15.760]  It's not good for America, but they did this as bankers, and they knew that when that story
[29:15.760 --> 29:19.200]  got into the news, people would say, hey, Ma, look at this.
[29:19.200 --> 29:22.960]  These big bankers don't like this Federal Reserve system very much.
[29:22.960 --> 29:24.640]  Must be a good bill.
[29:24.640 --> 29:27.640]  They knew that that would be the reaction of the average person.
[29:27.640 --> 29:28.640]  So they're clever.
[29:28.640 --> 29:29.640]  They're smart.
[29:29.640 --> 29:33.480]  They didn't get to be in the positions of power that they are by being stupid, but on
[29:33.480 --> 29:35.240]  the other hand, can't be stupid either.
[29:35.240 --> 29:37.560]  We must understand that people do that.
[29:37.560 --> 29:40.400]  They do provide false leadership.
[29:40.400 --> 29:49.000]  They do present false images out there, just deliberately to trick the mind of the average
[29:49.000 --> 29:50.000]  person.
[29:50.000 --> 29:51.000]  Absolutely.
[29:51.000 --> 29:52.000]  Stay there.
[29:52.000 --> 29:53.000]  Final segment.
[29:53.000 --> 29:54.000]  We're on the march.
[29:54.000 --> 29:55.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:55.000 --> 30:00.360]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.360 --> 30:05.000]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[30:05.000 --> 30:06.000]  you to eat.
[30:06.000 --> 30:09.520]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you
[30:09.520 --> 30:12.480]  sick, go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[30:12.480 --> 30:14.160]  You don't have to cooperate.
[30:14.160 --> 30:15.560]  There is a solution.
[30:15.560 --> 30:19.040]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing
[30:19.040 --> 30:23.840]  products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[30:36.440 --> 30:37.440]  manager.

[31:07.200 --> 31:09.280]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.

[32:00.080 --> 32:04.720]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[32:04.720 --> 32:09.040]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[32:09.040 --> 32:13.360]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[32:13.360 --> 32:14.640]  allows you to have.
[32:14.640 --> 32:20.400]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[32:20.400 --> 32:24.760]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[32:24.760 --> 32:28.760]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[32:28.760 --> 32:32.240]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[32:32.240 --> 32:35.960]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[32:35.960 --> 32:40.760]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[32:40.760 --> 32:44.480]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[32:44.480 --> 32:45.840]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[32:45.840 --> 32:51.680]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com.
[32:51.680 --> 33:21.520]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[33:22.520 --> 33:27.520]  Tom Harris joining us in about eight minutes, he's there at the Copenhagen World Government
[33:27.520 --> 33:28.520]  Summit.
[33:28.520 --> 33:31.960]  I tell you, all this mainstream media that's still trying to say there's no world government,
[33:31.960 --> 33:35.880]  they look really stupid, as the UN and others openly announced that they haven't quite gotten
[33:35.880 --> 33:39.520]  their propaganda together, I think it's great.
[33:39.520 --> 33:43.800]  But gee, Edward, in the last six, seven minutes we have with you, I want to give you the floor.
[33:43.800 --> 33:47.240]  We were talking here in the break, you said it is really coming to a head, and I agree
[33:47.240 --> 33:50.920]  with the long view of history, they're not going to give up overnight, but I've given
[33:50.920 --> 33:56.440]  the analogy of Climate Gate being the Death Star plans getting out, and now, with their
[33:56.440 --> 33:59.120]  whole program in disarray, the Death Star is blown up.
[33:59.120 --> 34:03.600]  But they're still Imperial Star destroyers, the Empire still occupying all our systems,
[34:03.600 --> 34:08.400]  they're still in all our nations, but it's shown the rebellion that if we can blow up
[34:08.400 --> 34:12.800]  one of their biggest operations in the Info War, we can destroy these people, we can defeat
[34:12.800 --> 34:14.280]  them with the truth.
[34:14.280 --> 34:21.480]  That's so true, and what can I add to that, except that the thought that's always on my
[34:21.480 --> 34:27.120]  mind is, it's relatively easy for people to know what they don't want.
[34:27.120 --> 34:31.920]  We can see this growing tyranny, we can see the lies, we can see the deceit, we can see
[34:31.920 --> 34:36.960]  the increasing taxes, we can see the devastation of our purchasing power of our monetary unit,
[34:36.960 --> 34:41.280]  we can see the dumbing down of the kids in school, we can see all of these things, and
[34:41.280 --> 34:44.520]  we know we don't want that.
[34:44.520 --> 34:49.080]  And so it's easy, relatively easy to get people networked together and organized together,
[34:49.080 --> 34:52.480]  we're going to fight this, we're going to bring these people down.
[34:52.480 --> 34:56.920]  I long to hear people talk about, what are we going to replace it with?
[34:56.920 --> 34:57.920]  I want to hear more.
[34:57.920 --> 35:02.160]  Congress controlling our currency, cutting down the size of government, getting state
[35:02.160 --> 35:08.800]  sovereignty, getting rid of the government run public schools, not making the superheroes,
[35:08.800 --> 35:13.240]  but these sports people are actors, but being inventors again, getting back to a renaissance
[35:13.240 --> 35:14.240]  society.
[35:14.240 --> 35:18.900]  Exactly, and also even deeper than that, we could go and talk about political principles.
[35:18.900 --> 35:20.920]  What is the proper function of the state?
[35:20.920 --> 35:22.480]  What is the ideal system?
[35:22.480 --> 35:25.160]  Where did our system go wrong, or did it go wrong?
[35:25.160 --> 35:28.840]  These are the things that I want to hear more in the debate, and I recognize you have to
[35:28.840 --> 35:32.760]  mobilize people on the flashpoint, the anger point.
[35:32.760 --> 35:37.880]  This is what they don't like, but the reason I created Freedom Force, as you so well know,
[35:37.880 --> 35:42.680]  is because I wanted people to think about the political and ideological principles,
[35:42.680 --> 35:47.800]  the things that we should be building into the system after we recapture control of it,
[35:47.800 --> 35:50.280]  and we have a chance to create a better system.
[35:50.280 --> 35:51.440]  What will it be?
[35:51.440 --> 35:53.280]  What would it look like, you see?
[35:53.280 --> 35:58.640]  And I always want people to learn and think about the differences between collectivism
[35:58.640 --> 35:59.640]  and individualism.
[35:59.640 --> 36:01.840]  I want to hear those words used more often.
[36:01.840 --> 36:04.640]  And we've got to educate people, the horrors of collectivism.
[36:04.640 --> 36:11.840]  We know this animal kills people, enslaves people, misery and pain is its children.
[36:11.840 --> 36:17.600]  Yes, and what I want to see is for people to recognize that this is the same animal,
[36:17.600 --> 36:24.600]  whether it is in Nazi Germany or Red China, even today, or in Cuba, or if it's growing
[36:24.600 --> 36:28.000]  in the United States, it's just the same animal.
[36:28.000 --> 36:31.480]  So that's what I want to have people think about.
[36:31.480 --> 36:36.560]  It is collectivism, and because once you understand the principles of collectivism,
[36:36.560 --> 36:40.160]  you will not tolerate its growth even in your own country.
[36:40.160 --> 36:47.360]  So yes, I'm very optimistic about this rising tide of resistance to the growing tyranny,
[36:47.360 --> 36:52.960]  but now I think it's time for us to really focus on having people recognize on the positive
[36:52.960 --> 36:54.840]  things we want to replace it with.
[36:54.840 --> 36:56.440]  And Freedom Force International does that.
[36:56.440 --> 36:58.120]  Give us your family of websites.
[36:58.120 --> 37:00.240]  Yeah, it is a family of websites.
[37:00.240 --> 37:05.000]  The Freedom Force website is where we call it the think tank of our little world, and
[37:05.000 --> 37:10.160]  that's FreedomForceInternational.org, a lot of material there to read and study.
[37:10.160 --> 37:15.080]  The commercial site is Reality Zone, that's where people can buy our audios and our videos
[37:15.080 --> 37:18.840]  and our books, and that's RealityZone.com.
[37:18.840 --> 37:23.600]  Of course, we invite everybody to take our free weekly newsletter, and that's called
[37:23.600 --> 37:28.880]  the Unfiltered News, and they can get that simply by going to Reality Zone on the landing
[37:28.880 --> 37:31.920]  page, and they can see it.
[37:31.920 --> 37:32.920]  A lot of great material.
[37:32.920 --> 37:36.120]  You've been fighting this collectivist takeover for more than 40 years.
[37:36.120 --> 37:38.960]  You're speaking tonight at Brave New Books in Austin and Saturday at the Courtyard,
[37:38.960 --> 37:41.600]  Austin, downtown, 9.45 in the morning.
[37:41.600 --> 37:43.400]  People should get there earlier than that, though.
[37:43.400 --> 37:46.560]  G. Edward Griffin, thank you for coming into studio with us.
[37:46.560 --> 37:47.560]  Thank you, Alex.
[37:47.560 --> 37:48.760]  It's always a pleasure to be here.
[37:48.760 --> 37:49.760]  Keep it up.
[37:49.760 --> 37:50.760]  I'll try.
[37:50.760 --> 37:51.760]  You keep it up, too.
[37:51.760 --> 37:52.920]  You're a real tiger in the fight for liberty.
[37:52.920 --> 37:55.320]  Had Lord Moncton on the day, you've been in studio.
[37:55.320 --> 37:56.320]  This has been amazing.
[37:56.320 --> 37:57.320]  Thank you, G. Edward Griffin.
[37:57.320 --> 37:58.320]  Thank you.
[37:58.320 --> 38:06.160]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I am extremely honored here today to have engineer Tom Harris,
[38:06.160 --> 38:12.600]  Executive Director of the International Climate Science Coalition, a massive scientific group
[38:12.600 --> 38:18.160]  set up to counter the IPCC science fraud that's been proven to be a premeditated fraud.
[38:18.160 --> 38:19.720]  We don't just have the Climate Gate documents.
[38:19.720 --> 38:24.000]  We have the UN documents last week where they've been organizing the fraud together, and he
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.800]  is in Copenhagen right now, putting on their own conference.
[38:26.800 --> 38:35.800]  The website is copenhagenclimatechange.org, or climatescienceinternational.org.
[38:35.800 --> 38:41.480]  And if the last 22 minutes of this radio transmission from Copenhagen, Tom Harris joins
[38:41.480 --> 38:42.480]  us.
[38:42.480 --> 38:43.800]  Tom, thank you for spending time today.
[38:43.800 --> 38:46.320]  Yeah, that's great, Alan.
[38:46.320 --> 38:47.840]  So much is going on.
[38:47.840 --> 38:53.560]  In a nutshell, tell us about your group, your take on Climate Gate, the text of the Danish
[38:53.560 --> 38:57.240]  text of the treaty, where the Third World will actually have to make more cuts than
[38:57.240 --> 38:58.840]  the West, devastating them.
[38:58.840 --> 39:01.840]  Lord Moncton talked about the millions that will kill a year.
[39:01.840 --> 39:04.000]  Just look what the ethanol scam has done.
[39:04.000 --> 39:11.080]  And where do you think this conference is going in light of all this evidence of fraud
[39:11.080 --> 39:12.080]  coming out?
[39:12.080 --> 39:16.680]  Yeah, well, to start out with, the International Climate Science Coalition is the non-profit
[39:16.680 --> 39:21.840]  group of scientists who were not able to get into most of the UN activities.
[39:21.840 --> 39:24.960]  Some of them actually were, but they disagreed with the UN.
[39:24.960 --> 39:30.680]  We have with us about 60 scientists who are our advisors, and it was decided that we should
[39:30.680 --> 39:36.240]  actually ask the UN for some basic data, because one of the main concerns after Climate Gate
[39:36.240 --> 39:40.120]  was if the temperature data is corrupted, how much else is?
[39:40.120 --> 39:43.760]  And we hear about extreme weather events increasing and all that sort of thing, but
[39:43.760 --> 39:47.320]  many of these scientists are actually experts in that field, and they know that the extreme
[39:47.320 --> 39:52.800]  weather records were set in the 1800s and early 1900s when it comes to typhoons and
[39:52.800 --> 39:54.160]  hurricanes and things like that.
[39:54.160 --> 39:59.280]  So instead of actually making the point to the UN that they're wrong, we thought, well,
[39:59.280 --> 40:04.000]  look, if they're not sharing data on temperature, why can't we get them to share data on everything
[40:04.000 --> 40:05.000]  else?
[40:05.000 --> 40:08.840]  So we sent an open letter to the Secretary General of the United Nations, and it's interesting
[40:08.840 --> 40:14.640]  that the project actually started about a month ago before the CRU scandal, the Climate
[40:14.640 --> 40:15.640]  Gate.
[40:15.640 --> 40:19.280]  But at that time, we were getting a signature a day or something like that.
[40:19.280 --> 40:23.760]  But after the scandal in England, we've been swamped with signatures.
[40:23.760 --> 40:27.400]  We've been getting hundreds of signatures of leading scientists from around the world
[40:27.400 --> 40:31.600]  who are now saying, well, if that data was wrong and manipulated, we want to see all
[40:31.600 --> 40:32.600]  the data.
[40:32.600 --> 40:38.240]  So I went through the list, and some of them are leading experts, but they're not necessarily
[40:38.240 --> 40:39.320]  climate experts.
[40:39.320 --> 40:45.200]  So I pulled out 150 of them who actually are climate experts from 17 different countries
[40:45.200 --> 40:49.400]  who are now demanding that the data be released in a whole range of fields.
[40:49.400 --> 40:53.000]  And it can be very interesting to see what the UN do, because in some cases, like their
[40:53.000 --> 40:59.080]  polar bear scare, the data shows that the population has more than doubled since 1960,
[40:59.080 --> 41:03.240]  and that they've been around for about 70,000 years, during which time it was hotter than
[41:03.240 --> 41:05.760]  they're forecasting for the 21st century.
[41:05.760 --> 41:09.000]  So it's going to be tough for the UN to answer our challenge.
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.200]  Well, absolutely.
[41:11.200 --> 41:16.360]  I'm sure you've been following that in New Zealand, in Australia, in Canada, NOAA, NASA,
[41:16.360 --> 41:22.560]  other universities are being caught fixing the data along with the IPCC, that the UN
[41:22.560 --> 41:28.040]  had this strategy, that people were already trying to get the climate research center
[41:28.040 --> 41:32.640]  data because they were already being caught in fraud by the research.
[41:32.640 --> 41:35.680]  But now we know that it's premeditated.
[41:35.680 --> 41:40.000]  And so this is just the tip of the iceberg is more whistleblowers come out, more scientists
[41:40.000 --> 41:41.240]  that were persecuted.
[41:41.240 --> 41:47.600]  I mean, I think it's safe to say that the beginning of the end of the charlatans has
[41:47.600 --> 41:48.600]  begun.
[41:48.600 --> 41:50.840]  Do you agree that they're starting to really bleed out?
[41:50.840 --> 41:52.400]  Oh, yeah, exactly.
[41:52.400 --> 41:57.160]  And I think that if they do start to respond to our challenge, you know, in a way, it would
[41:57.160 --> 42:00.400]  be good because, well, I mean, from our point of view, it would be good because then we
[42:00.400 --> 42:02.560]  can find more of these flaws.
[42:02.560 --> 42:07.160]  But the fact that the UN probably won't respond to our challenge is actually an admission
[42:07.160 --> 42:11.640]  of guilt, because if you think about it, this data was collected with public money.
[42:11.640 --> 42:15.920]  It shouldn't have been 17 years of trying to get the data before a whistleblower, who's
[42:15.920 --> 42:24.160]  probably the cause of this, not a hacker, it shouldn't have taken 17 years to get the
[42:24.160 --> 42:28.120]  basic data that was being used to generate public policy.
[42:28.120 --> 42:32.880]  And so I think that Climate Gate has been a great Christmas gift to us because it's
[42:32.880 --> 42:37.080]  shown an example of what they've suspected for years, and that is that when you look
[42:37.080 --> 42:41.560]  at the real data, much of the climate scare is just simply not there.
[42:41.560 --> 42:44.360]  Well, I mean, you talk about polar bears.
[42:44.360 --> 42:49.440]  I have seen on television, they're teaching children that penguins are drowning when it's
[42:49.440 --> 42:54.680]  an aquatic bird that can barely walk and can't fly because it's meant to swim.
[42:54.680 --> 43:00.360]  Polar bears, the greatest land swimming animal, routinely swim over 100 miles, have been recorded
[43:00.360 --> 43:01.560]  to swim over 300.
[43:01.560 --> 43:03.520]  They hunt on ice packs.
[43:03.520 --> 43:08.800]  But just two weeks ago, Austin News said the polar bears are all dying, they're drowning,
[43:08.800 --> 43:12.800]  they showed video of them floating on ice packs where they're out killing seals in
[43:12.800 --> 43:18.800]  beluga, the fraud of the hockey stick, the fraud of carbon dioxide, simultaneously with
[43:18.800 --> 43:22.040]  temperature rise when it comes, as you know, hundreds of years after.
[43:22.040 --> 43:26.600]  I mean, everything these people say, the oceans will turn into acid, acid rain.
[43:26.600 --> 43:32.600]  In the 70s, Holdren said we had to put out giant terraforming factories to double CO2
[43:32.600 --> 43:34.840]  or we'd be in an ice age by 2000.
[43:34.840 --> 43:41.480]  I mean, the level of fraudulent quackery is just, this is clearly the greatest scientific
[43:41.480 --> 43:42.840]  fraud in history.
[43:42.840 --> 43:46.240]  Can you comment on that and then what you're witnessing in Copenhagen?
[43:46.240 --> 43:48.280]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[43:48.280 --> 43:51.640]  I mean, obviously there were big scientific frauds in history, like thinking the earth
[43:51.640 --> 43:55.160]  was flat and the sixth seventh of the earth was covered with land.
[43:55.160 --> 43:58.840]  There were lots of frauds, but I don't think any of them have cost the world as much as
[43:58.840 --> 43:59.840]  this one.
[43:59.840 --> 44:04.520]  I mean, this one, they're talking about literally trillions of dollars, you know, if OECD countries
[44:04.520 --> 44:09.720]  followed Kyoto, the cost that's estimated would be about a trillion dollars a year.
[44:09.720 --> 44:14.240]  And that would mean that for one years of Kyoto expenditure, they could actually fix
[44:14.240 --> 44:18.120]  the freshwater drinking problem in Africa virtually forever.
[44:18.120 --> 44:22.520]  And right now, there's about 5 million people a year, mostly children who die in Africa
[44:22.520 --> 44:24.400]  due to bad drinking water.
[44:24.400 --> 44:28.120]  And that problem could be solved with one year's expenditure on Kyoto.
[44:28.120 --> 44:32.520]  So independent of your politics, one of the points we're trying to make is that this is
[44:32.520 --> 44:34.560]  just a bad use of money.
[44:34.560 --> 44:38.680]  So we're trying to expand the tent, not just for right wing or center, but we're also
[44:38.680 --> 44:42.840]  trying to attract left wingers, which we're slowly doing because, you know, left, right
[44:42.840 --> 44:46.880]  or center, nobody wants to throw a trillion dollars a year down the drain, although sometimes
[44:46.880 --> 44:47.880]  I wonder.
[44:47.880 --> 44:52.320]  But regardless, we're finding that one of the reasons we haven't been winning up to
[44:52.320 --> 44:57.160]  this point is because we only are attracting our traditional allies, you know, people
[44:57.160 --> 45:01.360]  like yourself and others who think about the issues, but also people who generally tend
[45:01.360 --> 45:03.000]  to be a bit right of center.
[45:03.000 --> 45:07.520]  But if we're going to win this debate, we have to get a lot more people on our side.
[45:07.520 --> 45:09.520]  We have to make allies with people who are ordinarily-
[45:09.520 --> 45:13.280]  Well, sir, I agree, but I mean, the way to reach out to the left, and I'm past the left-right
[45:13.280 --> 45:18.960]  period, I'm more of a libertarian, and just a realist, is conservatively, we're talking
[45:18.960 --> 45:24.400]  about millions and millions of people dying a year of a fraction of these carbon cuts
[45:24.400 --> 45:25.520]  are made.
[45:25.520 --> 45:30.680]  And now we learn in the draft treaty that third world has to make close to double the
[45:30.680 --> 45:32.120]  cuts of the first world.
[45:32.120 --> 45:36.840]  I mean, even if the left, you just believe this would be a big money grab to help the
[45:36.840 --> 45:39.280]  third world, it has nothing to do with that.
[45:39.280 --> 45:46.480]  It's an insider trading carbon derivative system developed by Ken Lay.
[45:46.480 --> 45:50.200]  I mean, this is just a giant carnival scam.
[45:50.200 --> 45:53.720]  One of the things that people forget is that there's a lot of investment firms who have
[45:53.720 --> 45:55.560]  invested billions of dollars.
[45:55.560 --> 45:58.760]  I won't mention the names because I don't want to get sued, but the bottom line is,
[45:58.760 --> 46:03.760]  I said to one of the carbon brokers the other day, I said, such and such a company has bought
[46:03.760 --> 46:05.840]  a billion dollars worth of carbon credits.
[46:05.840 --> 46:06.920]  Now, they don't need them.
[46:06.920 --> 46:08.760]  They're just doing it on speculation.
[46:08.760 --> 46:11.320]  So they want to see the climate scare continue.
[46:11.320 --> 46:13.720]  And he said to me, oh, a billion dollars, that's nothing.
[46:13.720 --> 46:16.680]  A lot of companies have invested a lot more than that.
[46:16.680 --> 46:22.880]  And so what you're finding is that some organizations are actually helping fund scare movies.
[46:22.880 --> 46:27.160]  For example, The Eleventh Hour by Leonardo DiCaprio, which is like a super outdoor film
[46:27.160 --> 46:29.120]  that's even more exaggerated.
[46:29.120 --> 46:33.200]  That's actually being funded in part by Swiss Reed, which are one of the world's largest
[46:33.200 --> 46:34.200]  insurance companies.
[46:34.200 --> 46:37.720]  And you have to say, well, why would they fund the climate scare video?
[46:37.720 --> 46:41.400]  Well, of course, the answer is obvious that people think that there's massive climate
[46:41.400 --> 46:42.400]  problems coming.
[46:42.400 --> 46:43.400]  They're going to buy more insurance.
[46:43.400 --> 46:44.880]  They can raise the premiums.
[46:44.880 --> 46:49.720]  And so what you're seeing is an enormous vested interest in actually keeping the scare alive.
[46:49.720 --> 46:54.600]  And that's a scary thing, because how long can the scare continue if the data is wrong?
[46:54.600 --> 46:59.040]  Well, it might continue for quite a long time if there's enough people funding it.
[46:59.040 --> 47:03.200]  And that's basically what it comes down to, I think, is that there is billions to be made.
[47:03.200 --> 47:08.040]  Even, as some people say, hundreds of billions, if in fact the scare continues.
[47:08.040 --> 47:12.960]  So if scientists laugh at the conference that we organized or helped organize, they said,
[47:12.960 --> 47:17.240]  how long does it have to cool before politicians stop calling it global warming?
[47:17.240 --> 47:20.160]  Well, actually, it might cool for a long time.
[47:20.160 --> 47:22.080]  And that's what many of the scientists are saying.
[47:22.080 --> 47:25.880]  But the scare may continue anyways, because there's so much money behind it.
[47:25.880 --> 47:26.880]  That's a good question.
[47:26.880 --> 47:31.240]  You're talking to a lot of top real non-political climatologists.
[47:31.240 --> 47:33.520]  And the sun, they say, is the main driver.
[47:33.520 --> 47:39.360]  But also, this nuclei coming out of space, there's a lot of other things going on.
[47:39.360 --> 47:42.680]  It does appear that most of the climatologists we read say, no, actually, it's a normal
[47:42.680 --> 47:44.080]  cooling trend.
[47:44.080 --> 47:46.960]  What is the majority view of the scientists you're talking to?
[47:46.960 --> 47:50.200]  Well, the majority view is that they don't know.
[47:50.200 --> 47:51.200]  They have various theories.
[47:51.200 --> 47:52.920]  It's kind of like a bell curve.
[47:52.920 --> 47:57.880]  There's very few on the side that say, we are definitely not causing any climate change.
[47:57.880 --> 48:00.720]  There's very few on the side that say that we're causing all of it.
[48:00.720 --> 48:04.680]  It's more of a distribution in the middle where the vast majority of them say, well,
[48:04.680 --> 48:05.680]  we don't know.
[48:05.680 --> 48:06.680]  The science is so immature.
[48:06.680 --> 48:08.400]  Take clouds, for example.
[48:08.400 --> 48:13.400]  Clouds are 100 times more influential on climate than humans, all like human activity
[48:13.400 --> 48:14.400]  combined.
[48:14.400 --> 48:19.520]  And yet, it was only 10 years ago that we thought the net impact of clouds was to contribute
[48:19.520 --> 48:23.960]  to global warming because, of course, it's water vapor and that's a greenhouse gas.
[48:23.960 --> 48:28.200]  But recently, they found that, in fact, clouds are a net cooling agent because they reflect
[48:28.200 --> 48:32.000]  more of the sunlight into space than they actually trap in the atmosphere.
[48:32.000 --> 48:36.320]  So not only have they changed the magnitude of the cloud impact, which, as I say, is far
[48:36.320 --> 48:39.600]  more than human, but they've even changed the sign.
[48:39.600 --> 48:45.120]  So the whole concept of the science is settled as to what the other cause might be.
[48:45.120 --> 48:49.200]  It's probably not CO2, whether it's the sun, whether it's ocean currents, whether it's
[48:49.200 --> 48:53.040]  land use change, or whether, as you say, it's cosmic rays from space.
[48:53.040 --> 48:57.800]  I mean, the bottom line is we're in an era of negative discovery where the more we learn,
[48:57.800 --> 49:00.120]  the more we realize that we just don't understand.
[49:00.120 --> 49:01.920]  Yeah, this is incredibly complex.
[49:01.920 --> 49:07.120]  For a giant planet, hurtling through deep space, orbiting a gigantic sun, I mean, and
[49:07.120 --> 49:12.800]  they're saying that humans exhaling five and a half pounds or flatulence from bovine
[49:12.800 --> 49:17.320]  that have always been on the planet are deadly, oh, but a tax will save us.
[49:17.320 --> 49:18.320]  Yeah, yeah.
[49:18.320 --> 49:22.800]  I mean, a lot of this stuff is absurd, and the sad thing is that many conservatives who
[49:22.800 --> 49:26.440]  actually know it's wrong are saying the wrong thing.
[49:26.440 --> 49:30.480]  The conservative party in Canada, for example, before they came into power, they said they
[49:30.480 --> 49:34.240]  were going to get to the bottom of the climate change Kyoto scare.
[49:34.240 --> 49:37.840]  Once they got into power, their spin doctors clearly told them they could get more votes
[49:37.840 --> 49:41.560]  if they just changed their tune and said the same thing as Al Gore.
[49:41.560 --> 49:42.560]  And so that's what they've done.
[49:42.560 --> 49:46.920]  And I'm really ashamed as a Canadian to have our government saying things they know very
[49:46.920 --> 49:49.120]  well are completely wrong.
[49:49.120 --> 49:53.360]  We find that it's strange, but with the liberal government before our current conservative
[49:53.360 --> 49:58.040]  government, they would allow the occasional climate skeptic to come into committee hearings
[49:58.040 --> 49:59.160]  to testify.
[49:59.160 --> 50:03.280]  But ever since the supposedly conservative government has come in, they've actually
[50:03.280 --> 50:04.280]  closed the door totally.
[50:04.280 --> 50:05.280]  Oh, yeah.
[50:05.280 --> 50:06.440]  Look at Newt Gingrich.
[50:06.440 --> 50:07.760]  Look at Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[50:07.760 --> 50:10.120]  This is not a partisan issue.
[50:10.120 --> 50:14.960]  It's an issue of people that want to regulate and control our economy and vertically integrate
[50:14.960 --> 50:15.960]  it.
[50:15.960 --> 50:16.960]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[50:16.960 --> 50:21.560]  And it's also an issue of a lack of courage on the part of many politicians who know that
[50:21.560 --> 50:24.080]  people like Senator Inhofe are right.
[50:24.080 --> 50:25.600]  A lot of politicians know that.
[50:25.600 --> 50:31.040]  I've talked to many of the MPs in Canada behind closed doors, and they know it's a scam, but
[50:31.040 --> 50:32.600]  they're afraid to say it.
[50:32.600 --> 50:36.600]  And we need a lot more courage and leadership in our government.
[50:36.600 --> 50:39.320]  Well, I agree with you, sir.
[50:39.320 --> 50:43.600]  We're going to go to break and come back with a final segment on the other side, so please
[50:43.600 --> 50:44.600]  stay with us.
[50:44.600 --> 50:51.920]  Tom Harris, Executive Director of the International Climate Science Coalition is our guest.
[50:51.920 --> 50:55.040]  We'll talk about what he's witnessing in Copenhagen.
[50:55.040 --> 51:02.680]  And if the climate-gate information is disturbing this globalist event, we'll be right back.
[51:02.680 --> 51:04.680]  Remain in your houses.
[51:04.680 --> 51:10.520]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11,004.
[51:10.520 --> 51:11.520]  Will they do it?
[51:11.520 --> 51:14.440]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[51:14.440 --> 51:20.040]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing
[51:20.040 --> 51:21.040]  day.
[51:21.040 --> 51:23.520]  Think it can't happen here?
[51:23.520 --> 51:27.720]  Executive Order 10,990 locks down all highways.
[51:27.720 --> 51:32.600]  Executive Order 10,995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[51:32.600 --> 51:37.160]  Executive Order 10,998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[51:37.160 --> 51:42.920]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[51:42.920 --> 51:47.040]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions
[51:47.040 --> 51:51.440]  about how to survive it, go to martiallawsurvival.com.
[51:51.440 --> 51:56.880]  Go to martiallawsurvival.com right now.
[51:56.880 --> 52:02.720]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[52:02.720 --> 52:06.480]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[52:06.480 --> 52:09.360]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[52:09.360 --> 52:13.960]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[52:13.960 --> 52:14.960]  at home.
[52:14.960 --> 52:20.160]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the
[52:20.160 --> 52:21.160]  shots.
[52:21.160 --> 52:25.920]  It's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[52:25.920 --> 52:29.240]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[52:29.240 --> 52:35.080]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing
[52:35.080 --> 52:36.080]  world government.
[52:36.080 --> 52:40.440]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[52:40.440 --> 52:42.440]  is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[52:42.440 --> 52:48.000]  Today, it seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[52:48.000 --> 52:49.840]  a fall of the Republic.
[52:49.840 --> 52:55.920]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com, or watch it online right
[52:55.920 --> 52:59.840]  now at superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv.
[52:59.840 --> 53:06.640]  If you owe the IRS money you can't pay, then listen carefully, because you already know
[53:06.640 --> 53:09.240]  that the problem won't go away by itself.
[53:09.240 --> 53:13.120]  You can get help today from the leading tax expert in the country, Dan Pilla.
[53:13.120 --> 53:14.640]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[53:14.640 --> 53:16.960]  The IRS isn't going to just forget about you.
[53:16.960 --> 53:20.720]  Right now, the IRS is hiring thousands of tax collectors to go after delinquent accounts
[53:20.720 --> 53:22.200]  just like yours.
[53:22.200 --> 53:24.960]  That's why you need to take action today, and I can help.
[53:24.960 --> 53:28.600]  I take a simple but proven approach to solving your tax debt problem.
[53:28.600 --> 53:32.520]  First, I stabilize collections so you don't have to worry about wage and bank levies.
[53:32.520 --> 53:36.960]  Next, I build a detailed plan to get your debt reduced to the fullest extent possible,
[53:36.960 --> 53:38.440]  sometimes even eliminated.
[53:38.440 --> 53:42.080]  Finally, I work with you every step of the way to get your problem solved once and for
[53:42.080 --> 53:43.080]  all.
[53:43.080 --> 53:44.920]  So call now for a free consultation.
[53:44.920 --> 53:47.920]  Call 1-800-346-6829.

[53:51.000 --> 53:53.680]  He's helped thousands of people, and he can help you too.
[53:53.680 --> 53:57.760]  Call us today at 800-346-6829.
[53:57.760 --> 54:27.600]  It may still have time, but it's still goodbye, every time I think about it, I won't stop.
[54:27.600 --> 54:37.000]  Tom Harris, Executive Director of the International Climate Science Coalition, a massive scientific
[54:37.000 --> 54:38.600]  group set up to counter the IPCC.
[54:38.600 --> 54:43.000]  We've only got about five minutes left right now, sir.
[54:43.000 --> 54:48.160]  And so I'd like to talk about what you're witnessing, what the mood is there, how climate
[54:48.160 --> 54:54.040]  gait is affecting the different 191 countries there, how the Danish text doubling the cuts
[54:54.040 --> 54:59.240]  for the third world resulting in just genocidal starvation.
[54:59.240 --> 55:00.840]  What the mood is there right now?
[55:00.840 --> 55:05.360]  Well, I think you have to realize, first of all, that both India and China have stated
[55:05.360 --> 55:09.440]  off and on throughout the whole year that they have no intention of restricting their
[55:09.440 --> 55:12.680]  economic growth to cut carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases.
[55:12.680 --> 55:16.880]  So I think the chances that they would have agreed to even a more benign treaty on their
[55:16.880 --> 55:19.080]  part were pretty slim to begin with.
[55:19.080 --> 55:23.120]  And also in India, we're starting to see the growth of a lot of climate skepticism.
[55:23.120 --> 55:27.320]  You know, many of the Indian glaciologists, for example, are completely rebutting the
[55:27.320 --> 55:29.640]  UN on Himalayan glacier.
[55:29.640 --> 55:33.880]  So in India, I have interviewed today actually with an Indian journalist, we're seeing the
[55:33.880 --> 55:37.200]  rise of climate skepticism like you've never seen it before.
[55:37.200 --> 55:41.760]  And I think that what's going to happen is that with these increased demands on the third
[55:41.760 --> 55:44.920]  world, they're just going to turn the whole thing down flatly.
[55:44.920 --> 55:49.680]  And it's interesting because in the United States, I understand that even the Democrats
[55:49.680 --> 55:53.400]  are saying that without agreement from China and India, they're just simply not going to
[55:53.400 --> 55:54.400]  go ahead.
[55:54.400 --> 55:55.680]  But that's the problem.
[55:55.680 --> 56:01.960]  We have the AP headline, White House Threatens Command and Control, says EPA will override
[56:01.960 --> 56:02.960]  Congress.
[56:02.960 --> 56:05.920]  That is putting the cart before the horse.
[56:05.920 --> 56:06.920]  That is tyranny.
[56:06.920 --> 56:08.420]  Yeah, exactly.
[56:08.420 --> 56:14.320]  But you know, I think that's pressure, a pressure tactic to try to get to the past Kerry Boxer.
[56:14.320 --> 56:15.320]  And it might succeed.
[56:15.320 --> 56:19.360]  The trouble is, of course, what you do with all those chief imports that are coming from
[56:19.360 --> 56:24.720]  countries is that the heck with greenhouse gas controls, I mean, it's just a death offense
[56:24.720 --> 56:25.720]  for the American economy.
[56:25.720 --> 56:26.720]  Exactly.
[56:26.720 --> 56:30.760]  As an engineer, let's say carbon dioxide is a deadly nerve gas.
[56:30.760 --> 56:33.960]  It kills all plants and animals, polar bears can't swim.
[56:33.960 --> 56:34.960]  Everyone's dying.
[56:34.960 --> 56:35.960]  Pay all your money to Al Gore.
[56:35.960 --> 56:36.960]  He will save you.
[56:36.960 --> 56:38.160]  He's the eco-profit.
[56:38.160 --> 56:40.480]  Let's say that's all true.
[56:40.480 --> 56:42.720]  You only put carbon controls on the West.
[56:42.720 --> 56:46.600]  It moves to China, India, Mexico, where they have no controls.
[56:46.600 --> 56:53.280]  All the devil gas, the man bear pig gas, that's a South Park episode if you don't know, sir,
[56:53.280 --> 56:55.680]  increases, increases, then we're all dead.
[56:55.680 --> 56:56.680]  I mean, it'll kill us.
[56:56.680 --> 57:01.720]  Well, one of the craziest things is China passed the United States and net carbon dioxide
[57:01.720 --> 57:04.440]  emissions in 2007.
[57:04.440 --> 57:08.880]  And even without these kinds of international agreements, you know, even if they just allowed
[57:08.880 --> 57:12.160]  them to continue to grow, they're going to be doubled the United States within about
[57:12.160 --> 57:13.160]  20 years.
[57:13.160 --> 57:17.880]  So, in fact, if you don't get them on side, the CO2 emissions for the world are going
[57:17.880 --> 57:18.880]  to virtually stay unchanged.
[57:18.880 --> 57:21.840]  I mean, they're going to continue to rise, I should say.
[57:21.840 --> 57:26.280]  But you know, one of the important things to realize is that throughout the world, there's
[57:26.280 --> 57:30.400]  countries who are now starting behind closed doors, Saudi Arabia did it in actually in
[57:30.400 --> 57:31.400]  the UN meeting.
[57:31.400 --> 57:35.160]  They're starting to look at the climate-gate data and they're starting to say, this is
[57:35.160 --> 57:40.040]  actually a social engineering project more than it is environmental.
[57:40.040 --> 57:43.560]  And we've heard within the Canadian government people telling me, look, it has nothing to
[57:43.560 --> 57:45.240]  do with environment anymore.
[57:45.240 --> 57:46.560]  It's all politics and money.
[57:46.560 --> 57:48.560]  Sir, you're a very influential man.
[57:48.560 --> 57:51.240]  Let me just, I want to mail you a copy of my film Endgame.
[57:51.240 --> 57:55.560]  Sir, they admit at the UN, this is eugenics.
[57:55.560 --> 58:01.240]  They want to cut, worry strong, the head guy says it's to destroy industrial society.
[58:01.240 --> 58:03.240]  And we need to, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[58:03.240 --> 58:07.640]  Yeah, Kyoto is the flagship of the World Governance Program.
[58:07.640 --> 58:09.520]  I mean, you can see that very clearly.
[58:09.520 --> 58:13.560]  If you control the world's CO2, you're controlling most of the world's energy.
[58:13.560 --> 58:17.200]  And if you're controlling the world's energy, just as Russia demonstrated when they turned
[58:17.200 --> 58:22.440]  off the past on the natural gas supply to Europe, you basically control whoever is at
[58:22.440 --> 58:23.440]  the other end of the past.
[58:23.440 --> 58:24.440]  All right.
[58:24.440 --> 58:28.840]  Reporting to us from Copenhagen, Tom Harris, climatescienceinternational.org.
[58:28.840 --> 58:29.840]  Thank you, sir.

[1:00:07.080 --> 1:00:29.920]  Well, as of an hour ago, we have the latest draft, which the media is reporting may be
[1:00:29.920 --> 1:00:38.960]  the final draft of the Global Governance Treaty, the most important meeting in the history
[1:00:38.960 --> 1:00:44.200]  of the United Nations, and that is in their words, and it certainly is.
[1:00:44.200 --> 1:00:46.420]  And it has the global tax.
[1:00:46.420 --> 1:00:49.040]  It has the 2% tax on all nations.
[1:00:49.040 --> 1:00:52.360]  It has a money transfer tax in it.
[1:00:52.360 --> 1:00:59.440]  It is just unbelievably corrupt, and it gives the private IMF and World Bank that the taxes
[1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:06.000]  are paid to the power to selectively enforce the rules.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:13.920]  We'll be discussing that on this Friday, the eighteenth day of December 2009 edition.
[1:01:13.920 --> 1:01:19.200]  I've seen some comments on infowars.com and prismplanet.com, and I've gotten a few emails
[1:01:19.200 --> 1:01:25.280]  saying, why are you spending so much time on climate gate and not more time on government
[1:01:25.280 --> 1:01:26.720]  takeover of healthcare?
[1:01:26.720 --> 1:01:29.760]  Well, you must not be listening.
[1:01:29.760 --> 1:01:32.760]  We've been spending a lot of time on government healthcare.
[1:01:32.760 --> 1:01:34.320]  We're trying to beat it in the Senate.
[1:01:34.320 --> 1:01:38.880]  If that doesn't work, we have a chance to beat it in the House.
[1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:44.160]  Right now, the momentum is shifting in our direction, but that has been widely debated
[1:01:44.160 --> 1:01:46.000]  all over the United States.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:50.040]  The people know about the prison time, the five years if you don't get prison, the quarter
[1:01:50.040 --> 1:01:51.720]  million dollar fine.
[1:01:51.720 --> 1:01:59.040]  We've been beating the drum for the last six months fighting it, and it's important.
[1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:02.560]  But you can always repeal government healthcare.
[1:02:02.560 --> 1:02:03.840]  It'll be hard to do.
[1:02:03.840 --> 1:02:07.260]  We can fight at the state level as well.
[1:02:07.260 --> 1:02:14.360]  We can always fight the death panels as big as government takeover of healthcare is.
[1:02:14.360 --> 1:02:22.360]  And frankly, it's nothing compared to open world government being established, and the
[1:02:22.360 --> 1:02:27.120]  president's signing us on to a treaty and saying he doesn't care if Congress doesn't
[1:02:27.120 --> 1:02:33.080]  implement it, that the United States will submit to global governance.
[1:02:33.080 --> 1:02:36.600]  And he's up there demonizing America as this great evil.
[1:02:36.600 --> 1:02:37.600]  This is a UN speech today.
[1:02:37.600 --> 1:02:40.560]  We're going to be playing it.
[1:02:40.560 --> 1:02:42.680]  And we've got to pay for our evil carbon.
[1:02:42.680 --> 1:02:45.280]  I mean, this is complete fraud.
[1:02:45.280 --> 1:02:50.440]  And in the next segment, I'm going to play the audio from the president's entire speech.
[1:02:50.440 --> 1:02:55.520]  It's only 10 and a half minutes long, and I'm going to stop and start briefly just pointing
[1:02:55.520 --> 1:03:02.520]  out the lies, but it's a fabric of lies, a tissue of lies, a compendium of lies.
[1:03:02.520 --> 1:03:05.480]  It is a infinity of lies.
[1:03:05.480 --> 1:03:07.800]  There's so many lies and so many intricacies.
[1:03:07.800 --> 1:03:15.400]  You could analyze the lies and fraud of this forever because it just ties into so many
[1:03:15.400 --> 1:03:19.560]  facets of government and the corrupt system we live under.
[1:03:19.560 --> 1:03:23.240]  We are not just covering the climate gate fraud.
[1:03:23.240 --> 1:03:27.720]  We're not just covering whether manmade global warming is real or not.
[1:03:27.720 --> 1:03:35.160]  We're discussing the issue of a dictatorial planetary government being established that
[1:03:35.160 --> 1:03:40.520]  once established is going to force global one-child policies, force drugging of the
[1:03:40.520 --> 1:03:45.720]  population, force sterilization and abortion.
[1:03:45.720 --> 1:03:51.000]  This is already going on in India and China and areas of Africa and Latin America where
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:59.440]  the UN comes in and pays off the governments to carry out sterilization, arrest, force
[1:03:59.440 --> 1:04:00.440]  drugging.
[1:04:00.440 --> 1:04:03.040]  It's all part of history.
[1:04:03.040 --> 1:04:07.240]  And we now have Fox News promoting putting lithium in the water.
[1:04:07.240 --> 1:04:08.320]  I got news for you.
[1:04:08.320 --> 1:04:11.240]  They're already doing it.
[1:04:11.240 --> 1:04:17.640]  So global government, the end of America, the president in a treasonous fashion signing
[1:04:17.640 --> 1:04:25.000]  on to it as he's swearing to do this evening, he says, in fact, even if it doesn't pass,
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:29.480]  even if they can't get the other dictatorships and communist countries to sign on because
[1:04:29.480 --> 1:04:31.240]  it's too tyrannical.
[1:04:31.240 --> 1:04:36.800]  He says he's going to unilaterally implement it over the American people to the UN.
[1:04:36.800 --> 1:04:42.720]  He's bringing us under UN IMF World Bank receivership, whether we like it or not.
[1:04:42.720 --> 1:04:46.200]  Now that's the biggest news out there, period.
[1:04:46.200 --> 1:04:48.600]  And that's what we're going to be covering.
[1:04:48.600 --> 1:04:56.000]  Of course, the COINTELPRO is very angry that we're rallying the people to defeat it, but
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:58.080]  your propaganda won't work.
[1:04:58.080 --> 1:05:02.040]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[1:05:02.040 --> 1:05:06.400]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:07.400]  do you want?
[1:05:07.400 --> 1:05:09.400]  My answer would be all I can get.
[1:05:09.400 --> 1:05:14.440]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[1:05:14.440 --> 1:05:15.640]  How much do you want?
[1:05:15.640 --> 1:05:16.720]  When do you want it?
[1:05:16.720 --> 1:05:18.680]  Now or after the battle starts.
[1:05:18.680 --> 1:05:19.800]  When will you need it?
[1:05:19.800 --> 1:05:21.920]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[1:05:21.920 --> 1:05:23.280]  Will there be any food?
[1:05:23.280 --> 1:05:24.720]  Will it make your children sick?
[1:05:24.720 --> 1:05:28.880]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[1:05:28.880 --> 1:05:30.040]  and be immunized?
[1:05:30.040 --> 1:05:33.800]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:05:33.800 --> 1:05:37.400]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[1:05:37.400 --> 1:05:38.640]  How much will you need?
[1:05:38.640 --> 1:05:39.640]  We don't know.
[1:05:39.640 --> 1:05:40.640]  How much do you want?
[1:05:40.640 --> 1:05:41.640]  All you can get.
[1:05:41.640 --> 1:05:42.640]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:05:42.640 --> 1:05:45.840]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[1:05:58.080 --> 1:06:02.040]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator
[1:06:02.040 --> 1:06:04.960]  that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[1:06:04.960 --> 1:06:07.000]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.

[1:06:57.920 --> 1:07:02.560]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[1:07:02.560 --> 1:07:03.560]  you to eat.
[1:07:03.560 --> 1:07:07.080]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you
[1:07:07.080 --> 1:07:08.080]  sick?
[1:07:08.080 --> 1:07:10.040]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[1:07:10.040 --> 1:07:12.880]  You don't have to cooperate, there is a solution.
[1:07:12.880 --> 1:07:16.560]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing
[1:07:16.560 --> 1:07:21.400]  products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  Manager.

[1:08:03.720 --> 1:08:08.480]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:08:08.480 --> 1:08:09.480]  You want answers?
[1:08:09.480 --> 1:08:11.640]  Well, so does he.
[1:08:11.640 --> 1:08:20.320]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:08:20.320 --> 1:08:33.280]  It is Friday, the 18th day of December, 2009, as we hurdle into 2010, Piers Corbin, a top
[1:08:33.280 --> 1:08:42.800]  meteorologist, one of the most world-famous out there for accurately predicting the weather.
[1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:45.640]  Even a year in advance, he is world-famous.
[1:08:45.640 --> 1:08:50.480]  He's been exposing the climate fraudsters for what they are.
[1:08:50.480 --> 1:08:58.520]  He will be joining us in T-minus 23 minutes from now on this Friday edition.
[1:08:58.520 --> 1:09:03.600]  Wayne Madsen will be popping in, coming up in the middle of the next hour on a host of
[1:09:03.600 --> 1:09:11.560]  global issues, and we're also going to be talking to John Schaefer of a very popular
[1:09:11.560 --> 1:09:18.000]  rock band that's on scores of billboard charts right now.
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:25.280]  He is with the band Iced Earth, but he is releasing today here on this radio show.
[1:09:25.280 --> 1:09:30.120]  We're very honored that he contacted us to do this, much of my crew are fans of Iced
[1:09:30.120 --> 1:09:31.120]  Earth.
[1:09:31.120 --> 1:09:36.220]  Iced Earth has been around for a long time.
[1:09:36.220 --> 1:09:42.600]  They are putting out a free album, and I've listened to a lot of their music.
[1:09:42.600 --> 1:09:46.120]  I think this is one of their best albums, but because of the record label and things,
[1:09:46.120 --> 1:09:50.880]  they're putting it out of the title, Sons of Liberty, because it's free.
[1:09:50.880 --> 1:09:56.240]  Of course, you can't have a record label that lets you put something out free, so the band
[1:09:56.240 --> 1:10:01.560]  put this out separately themselves for free, and let me tell you, it's some of the best
[1:10:01.560 --> 1:10:06.440]  work I've heard from Iced Earth, and it is just amazing.
[1:10:06.440 --> 1:10:12.960]  In fact, I had a folder in here that had all the lyrics for Iced Earth, in the Fed, in
[1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:20.840]  the Fed, the answer to 1984, 1776, I'm setting bushfires in the minds of men.
[1:10:20.840 --> 1:10:28.640]  You can better believe this radio show in our work, and Ron Paul's work is a big influence
[1:10:28.640 --> 1:10:33.720]  on some of the latest music from Iced Earth, who reached millions of fans, so we're excited
[1:10:33.720 --> 1:10:35.920]  about having him in here for a full hour.
[1:10:35.920 --> 1:10:39.640]  Of course, it's the end of the Copenhagen event, the global government establishing
[1:10:39.640 --> 1:10:45.880]  event, and it is an Iced Earth there, record cold temperatures right now in Denmark and
[1:10:45.880 --> 1:10:48.320]  in Canada, and in other areas of the world.
[1:10:48.320 --> 1:10:52.440]  There was snowing a week and a half ago in Houston, Texas, that's generally basically
[1:10:52.440 --> 1:11:02.400]  tropical, down on the Gulf of Mexico, entering into the mouth of the Caribbean, so that is
[1:11:02.400 --> 1:11:05.120]  coming up later in the broadcast today.
[1:11:05.120 --> 1:11:12.640]  Oh, and we have Robert Wannick, the high school student, who's won some of our contest awards,
[1:11:12.640 --> 1:11:19.000]  an active 9-11 truther, Robert Wannick got beat up by a teacher and suspended for handing
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:23.200]  out flu vaccine inserts.
[1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:28.480]  You hand out the actual inserts that, say, can give you cancer, sterilize you, kill you,
[1:11:28.480 --> 1:11:35.440]  give you Guillain beret, or Gillian beret in English, has mercury in it, it's all admitted
[1:11:35.440 --> 1:11:41.040]  in the insert, you try to hand that out, they get very angry, and he's got witnesses to
[1:11:41.040 --> 1:11:47.200]  the fact that he was assaulted in America by this particular schoolteacher, and so he
[1:11:47.200 --> 1:11:50.400]  will be joining us to talk about this today.
[1:11:50.400 --> 1:11:54.200]  It's funny watching Wannick, the last two years, go from like a 13-year-old kid to now
[1:11:54.200 --> 1:12:00.040]  the chin and the hormones going up, and he's turning into a man.
[1:12:00.040 --> 1:12:05.440]  It's amazing to see that transformation, he was a little kid a few years ago fighting
[1:12:05.440 --> 1:12:09.520]  the New World Order, and now he, let's just hope he can get out of high school, let him
[1:12:09.520 --> 1:12:17.520]  setting him up, and sending him down the river for daring to be a thought criminal.
[1:12:17.520 --> 1:12:20.600]  So that is coming up today.
[1:12:20.600 --> 1:12:23.600]  Okay, here's what I want to do right now.
[1:12:23.600 --> 1:12:28.760]  This is a 10 and a half minute clip, and in the rest of this segment, the next segment,
[1:12:28.760 --> 1:12:35.360]  I want to attempt to play the Obama speech and then stop it and make quick comments about
[1:12:35.360 --> 1:12:36.360]  his lies.
[1:12:36.360 --> 1:12:41.120]  If I don't finish now, I'll finish this later when we're live at PrisonPlanet.tv so you
[1:12:41.120 --> 1:12:43.480]  can watch the teleprompter reader.
[1:12:43.480 --> 1:12:48.080]  He doesn't have a teleprompter here, so he's having a lot of trouble, and here the media
[1:12:48.080 --> 1:12:52.600]  said he was angry, he was desperate, he commits America even if the rest of the countries
[1:12:52.600 --> 1:12:56.720]  don't sign on, and it's just all lies.
[1:12:56.720 --> 1:13:04.240]  So we're going to now critique and translate and break down the manifest congenital fraud
[1:13:04.240 --> 1:13:11.920]  of Barack H. Obama today in Copenhagen, Denmark, trying to force through, according to what
[1:13:11.920 --> 1:13:15.360]  Ban Ki-moon says, the birth of world government.
[1:13:15.360 --> 1:13:18.360]  Here it is.
[1:13:18.360 --> 1:13:25.680]  It is an honor for me to join this distinguished group of leaders from nations around the world.
[1:13:25.680 --> 1:13:33.800]  We come here in Copenhagen because climate change poses a grave and growing danger to
[1:13:33.800 --> 1:13:34.800]  our people.
[1:13:34.800 --> 1:13:40.680]  Okay, he just states that it's an absolute fact, like a unified corporate press has been
[1:13:40.680 --> 1:13:43.320]  doing, that it poses a great danger.
[1:13:43.320 --> 1:13:48.800]  We've got to establish the global government, you've got to pay these taxes to us, or basically
[1:13:48.800 --> 1:13:49.800]  the earth is doomed.
[1:13:49.800 --> 1:13:52.080]  I mean, just fraud, continue.
[1:13:52.080 --> 1:13:59.160]  It poses a grave and growing danger to our people.
[1:13:59.160 --> 1:14:06.640]  All of you would not be here unless you, like me, were convinced that this danger is real.
[1:14:06.640 --> 1:14:07.640]  It possibly.
[1:14:07.640 --> 1:14:14.760]  Okay, from the 191 governments, there are conservatively, on record, more than 50 of
[1:14:14.760 --> 1:14:22.120]  the delegates there who are questioning man-made climate change and questioning climate gait.
[1:14:22.120 --> 1:14:26.320]  And there are heads of state from many of these governments who are publicly saying it
[1:14:26.320 --> 1:14:32.680]  is a fraud, but there he said, you are all here, you are all here in agreement.
[1:14:32.680 --> 1:14:36.480]  He just keeps stating the lie that everyone knows the earth is doomed.
[1:14:36.480 --> 1:14:38.400]  Everyone knows we've got to have the global tax.
[1:14:38.400 --> 1:14:40.160]  Everyone is in agreement.
[1:14:40.160 --> 1:14:45.680]  So he just keeps stating the Borg lie that not only will you be assimilated, you have
[1:14:45.680 --> 1:14:47.160]  been assimilated.
[1:14:47.160 --> 1:14:49.840]  Just all lies, every word, continue.
[1:14:49.840 --> 1:14:52.600]  That this danger is real.
[1:14:52.600 --> 1:14:56.240]  This is not fiction, it is science.
[1:14:56.240 --> 1:14:57.320]  Good pause.
[1:14:57.320 --> 1:14:58.320]  Back it up.
[1:14:58.320 --> 1:14:59.320]  Back it up 20 seconds.
[1:14:59.320 --> 1:15:01.880]  I want people to hear all this again.
[1:15:01.880 --> 1:15:05.160]  So again, he says, you're all here because you want to save the earth.
[1:15:05.160 --> 1:15:06.960]  All of you are in agreement.
[1:15:06.960 --> 1:15:08.400]  You know this is real.
[1:15:08.400 --> 1:15:09.760]  It's not some fiction.
[1:15:09.760 --> 1:15:14.040]  Now, what you just heard is just, and the body language says it.
[1:15:14.040 --> 1:15:17.720]  It's like Bill Clinton, when he shook his finger and said, I did not have sex with that
[1:15:17.720 --> 1:15:22.520]  woman, Monica Lewinsky, or read my lips, no new taxes.
[1:15:22.520 --> 1:15:24.600]  When everybody heard it, they knew it was a lie.
[1:15:24.600 --> 1:15:26.600]  George Herbert Walker said it.
[1:15:26.600 --> 1:15:29.880]  When Bill Clinton said it, when Nixon said, I'm not a crook.
[1:15:29.880 --> 1:15:31.720]  I'm not a crook.
[1:15:31.720 --> 1:15:33.300]  People knew he was a crook.
[1:15:33.300 --> 1:15:37.200]  So here he is saying we all agree, that's a lie.
[1:15:37.200 --> 1:15:40.200]  Everyone here agrees, another lie.
[1:15:40.200 --> 1:15:42.440]  The science has settled another lie.
[1:15:42.440 --> 1:15:44.320]  This is not fiction, another lie.
[1:15:44.320 --> 1:15:49.480]  It is a complete fiction, according to the words of the Club of Rome in the 1960s and
[1:15:49.480 --> 1:15:55.160]  again in 1991, and we have those articles directly from the Club of Rome posted the scans of
[1:15:55.160 --> 1:16:01.480]  their own publication saying we're making this up to bring in global government.
[1:16:01.480 --> 1:16:09.320]  This is a grave and growing danger to our people.
[1:16:09.320 --> 1:16:18.080]  All of you would not be here unless you, like me, were convinced that this danger is real.
[1:16:18.080 --> 1:16:22.280]  This is not fiction, it is science.
[1:16:22.280 --> 1:16:25.240]  It is science.
[1:16:25.240 --> 1:16:33.320]  You got to love how the three top institutions, NASA Goddard, East Anglia University, and
[1:16:33.320 --> 1:16:39.240]  the UN itself, the three top groups, the head of the IPCC, has admitted now that he took
[1:16:39.240 --> 1:16:46.520]  out five scientists in the report who said man is not contributing to climate change.
[1:16:46.520 --> 1:16:53.880]  The UN's own report says maybe a degree, and that's a fraud.
[1:16:53.880 --> 1:17:01.560]  But you've got to love how they always say, well, what's really happening here is, sure,
[1:17:01.560 --> 1:17:05.440]  there were some mistakes and some lying by a few low-level scientists, but we have all
[1:17:05.440 --> 1:17:07.880]  these other hundreds of peer-reviewed journals.
[1:17:07.880 --> 1:17:13.400]  The peer-reviewed journals are all based on those lies, and there's hundreds of them.
[1:17:13.400 --> 1:17:18.160]  Quick examples in the last decade is there are thousands of buoys in the ocean, there
[1:17:18.160 --> 1:17:23.800]  are thousands of weather stations, and all the United Nations did was go cherry-pick
[1:17:23.800 --> 1:17:28.960]  the particular buoys in weather stations that did have increases for the year and then only
[1:17:28.960 --> 1:17:29.960]  enter that data.
[1:17:29.960 --> 1:17:36.520]  There's that fraud, or they zoom in on the ice core sample record of temperature that
[1:17:36.520 --> 1:17:44.040]  is detailed down to 1,000th of a degree per year, and they go into that, and they only
[1:17:44.040 --> 1:17:48.800]  zoom in on the last 50 years or so to show an increase we had in the last 50 years that's
[1:17:48.800 --> 1:17:49.800]  now declining.
[1:17:49.800 --> 1:17:53.600]  They don't show you that 50 years before that there was a spike, and 100 years before that
[1:17:53.600 --> 1:18:00.680]  a big spike, and 200 years before that a giant spike tripling the spike we've seen when people
[1:18:00.680 --> 1:18:09.960]  were running around in togas, the earth on average was 9 degrees hotter.
[1:18:09.960 --> 1:18:15.600]  Oh, and forget that, you want to go back to the Bronze Age, the beginning of the Bronze
[1:18:15.600 --> 1:18:21.640]  Age 9,000 years ago, stuff got hot and so humans could grow more food and weren't just
[1:18:21.640 --> 1:18:28.320]  on the edge of starvation, and there were more animals grazing, so it was more to hunt,
[1:18:28.320 --> 1:18:33.960]  and so that's where we got the beginnings of civilization, 9,000 years ago.
[1:18:33.960 --> 1:18:38.960]  We can really thank the sun for heating up during that period.
[1:18:38.960 --> 1:18:39.960]  Thank you, sun.
[1:18:39.960 --> 1:18:45.440]  I mean, the ancients knew the source of life, that's why they worshiped the sun, but the
[1:18:45.440 --> 1:18:50.840]  UN said on Monday, the sun has no effect on climate.
[1:18:50.840 --> 1:18:55.800]  That's like saying, shoot yourself 15 times in the head with a 12 gauge shotgun, won't
[1:18:55.800 --> 1:18:58.300]  kill you.
[1:18:58.300 --> 1:19:02.440]  It's like saying jumping off a 5,000 foot cliff without a parachute, and falling on
[1:19:02.440 --> 1:19:06.300]  to spikes, razor blade spikes won't hurt you.
[1:19:06.300 --> 1:19:11.000]  That's like saying pouring gasoline on yourself and lighting yourself on fire won't hurt.
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  That's like saying the Easter Bunny is real.
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:23.880]  I mean, it is complete mega fraud, mega joke, hey, how stupid are you out there?
[1:19:23.880 --> 1:19:27.600]  You know what, it's clear I'm not going to get to this now.
[1:19:27.600 --> 1:19:33.400]  Let me look at my schedule here, we got Pierce Corbin coming up in 10 minutes, Wayne Madsen
[1:19:33.400 --> 1:19:36.040]  after that.
[1:19:36.040 --> 1:19:41.040]  Before Robert Wannick comes on at one o'clock today, at the start of the third hour, I'm
[1:19:41.040 --> 1:19:45.320]  going to play all this video and just try to give shorter comments on it.
[1:19:45.320 --> 1:19:51.040]  It's hard because everything he says has like a million lies literally behind it.
[1:19:51.040 --> 1:19:52.040]  It's a joke.
[1:19:52.040 --> 1:19:55.600]  He might as well be up there telling you the Tooth Fairy is going to be his running mate
[1:19:55.600 --> 1:19:56.600]  in 2012.
[1:19:56.600 --> 1:20:00.320]  I mean, it is absolute bull.
[1:20:00.320 --> 1:20:02.200]  This is Big John Lipscomb.
[1:20:02.200 --> 1:20:05.760]  World government and all its tyranny is rapidly approaching.
[1:20:05.760 --> 1:20:10.440]  The choices you make today will determine your level of suffering and freedom tomorrow.
[1:20:10.440 --> 1:20:16.640]  I have two solutions for you so you and your family can stay strong and free.
[1:20:16.640 --> 1:20:24.000]  PatriotFood.com, 135 pounds of long lasting dehydrated food in 25 varieties.
[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:29.760]  That's one-fourth the cost of many freeze-dried offers of the same weight.
[1:20:29.760 --> 1:20:36.960]  And survivalistseeds.com, where I just released my best offer ever, 7,000 heirloom vegetable
[1:20:36.960 --> 1:20:40.160]  seeds, 30 varieties of vegetables.
[1:20:40.160 --> 1:20:46.440]  That's over four pounds of seed and I ship it in a time capsule so they will last decades.
[1:20:46.440 --> 1:20:51.120]  And now you can get a second for a $60 savings.
[1:20:51.120 --> 1:20:55.280]  PatriotFood.com and survivalistseeds.com.
[1:20:55.280 --> 1:20:58.760]  Anything else is just a copycat.
[1:20:58.760 --> 1:21:01.000]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  Spy on me?
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  Yeah.
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:05.800]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo and other search engines record all your searches and store
[1:21:05.800 --> 1:21:07.160]  them in a giant database?
[1:21:07.160 --> 1:21:08.960]  You should use StartPage instead.
[1:21:08.960 --> 1:21:09.960]  StartPage?
[1:21:09.960 --> 1:21:10.960]  Yeah.
[1:21:10.960 --> 1:21:11.960]  StartPage.com.
[1:21:11.960 --> 1:21:12.960]  The new name for Xquik.
[1:21:12.960 --> 1:21:13.960]  The world's most private search engine.
[1:21:13.960 --> 1:21:17.800]  They don't record your searches or your IP address and the search results are great.
[1:21:17.800 --> 1:21:20.800]  Plus, StartPage is third-party certified and it's totally free.
[1:21:20.800 --> 1:21:23.240]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the Internet.
[1:21:23.240 --> 1:21:25.200]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[1:21:25.200 --> 1:21:26.200]  Right.
[1:21:26.200 --> 1:21:28.720]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[1:21:28.720 --> 1:21:29.720]  Hello, folks.
[1:21:29.720 --> 1:21:30.800]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:21:30.800 --> 1:21:34.720]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[1:21:34.720 --> 1:21:38.360]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.

[1:21:43.880 --> 1:21:46.920]  Try seven days of StartPage and break the Big Brother habit.
[1:21:46.920 --> 1:21:48.720]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.
[1:21:48.720 --> 1:21:53.080]  Try StartPage.com for seven days and start protecting your privacy.
[1:21:53.080 --> 1:21:59.400]  That's StartPage.com.
[1:21:59.400 --> 1:22:00.400]  Gold isn't for you.
[1:22:00.400 --> 1:22:04.360]  Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious
[1:22:04.360 --> 1:22:05.680]  metal investing firms.
[1:22:05.680 --> 1:22:06.680]  I get it.
[1:22:06.680 --> 1:22:10.320]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that
[1:22:10.320 --> 1:22:14.760]  the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that social security
[1:22:14.760 --> 1:22:16.160]  would be there for you.
[1:22:16.160 --> 1:22:17.360]  That's not what's happening.
[1:22:17.360 --> 1:22:22.200]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the
[1:22:22.200 --> 1:22:25.800]  dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[1:22:25.800 --> 1:22:29.280]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[1:22:29.280 --> 1:22:33.600]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[1:22:33.600 --> 1:22:39.520]  Since 2001, the US dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[1:22:39.520 --> 1:22:42.880]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[1:22:42.880 --> 1:22:43.880]  You should, too.
[1:22:43.880 --> 1:22:44.880]  Find out what they know.
[1:22:44.880 --> 1:22:51.240]  I'll call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free, 800-686-2237.
[1:22:51.240 --> 1:22:54.240]  800-686-2237.
[1:22:54.240 --> 1:22:58.640]  That's 800-686-2237.
[1:22:58.640 --> 1:23:00.920]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[1:23:00.920 --> 1:23:02.920]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[1:23:02.920 --> 1:23:04.800]  No more mortgage can change your life.
[1:23:04.800 --> 1:23:06.240]  We paid off all of our bills.
[1:23:06.240 --> 1:23:09.040]  All your debt, including your mortgage, in as little as nine years?
[1:23:09.040 --> 1:23:14.720]  With no more mortgage, we will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments.
[1:23:14.720 --> 1:23:16.280]  Can we have more money left over each month?
[1:23:16.280 --> 1:23:20.040]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[1:23:20.040 --> 1:23:21.040]  No more mortgage.
[1:23:21.040 --> 1:23:22.680]  Where have they been all of our life?
[1:23:22.680 --> 1:23:25.200]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.
[1:23:25.200 --> 1:23:28.960]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.
[1:23:28.960 --> 1:23:31.280]  I'm Larry Ruff, president of No More Mortgage.
[1:23:31.280 --> 1:23:36.200]  This is unlike anything you have ever seen before, and it will absolutely not harm your
[1:23:36.200 --> 1:23:37.200]  credit.

[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:43.280]  you ever dream possible.

[1:24:12.120 --> 1:24:14.120]  Ira Hayes
[1:24:15.120 --> 1:24:17.120]  Ira Hayes
[1:24:19.120 --> 1:24:22.120]  Call him drunken Ira Hayes
[1:24:22.120 --> 1:24:25.120]  He will answer any more
[1:24:26.120 --> 1:24:28.120]  Not the whiskey drinking Indian
[1:24:28.120 --> 1:24:31.120]  Or the marine that went to war
[1:24:37.120 --> 1:24:39.120]  Get around me people
[1:24:39.120 --> 1:24:42.120]  There's a story I would tell
[1:24:42.120 --> 1:24:44.120]  About a brave young Indian
[1:24:44.120 --> 1:24:46.120]  We need to get excited
[1:24:46.120 --> 1:24:47.120]  We need to get angry
[1:24:47.120 --> 1:24:49.120]  We need to get focused
[1:24:49.120 --> 1:24:51.120]  We need to get outraged
[1:24:51.120 --> 1:24:53.120]  A private group of banks
[1:24:53.120 --> 1:24:55.120]  Have taken over our governments
[1:24:55.120 --> 1:24:58.120]  Given themselves the illegitimate criminal power
[1:24:58.120 --> 1:25:00.120]  I don't care if they say it's legal
[1:25:00.120 --> 1:25:04.120]  Hitler could say that murdering masses of people was legal
[1:25:04.120 --> 1:25:08.120]  Our nation, the courts, the congress
[1:25:08.120 --> 1:25:12.120]  Once said it was legal to have black people as slaves
[1:25:12.120 --> 1:25:14.120]  Pulling plows like a mule
[1:25:14.120 --> 1:25:17.120]  But in your heart you know that's a fraud
[1:25:17.120 --> 1:25:21.120]  So I don't care if the bankers paid off the politicians worldwide
[1:25:21.120 --> 1:25:24.120]  To let them issue unlimited currency and credit
[1:25:24.120 --> 1:25:26.120]  To all of us
[1:25:26.120 --> 1:25:28.120]  They own the money machines
[1:25:28.120 --> 1:25:30.120]  They owe the issuance of currency and credit
[1:25:30.120 --> 1:25:32.120]  They've taken over the planet
[1:25:32.120 --> 1:25:34.120]  Now they want to cut off your resources
[1:25:34.120 --> 1:25:36.120]  To force you
[1:25:37.120 --> 1:25:41.120]  Into actual chattel bondage and slavery
[1:25:42.120 --> 1:25:45.120]  That is the stated goal
[1:25:45.120 --> 1:25:47.120]  The stated operation
[1:25:47.120 --> 1:25:49.120]  And of course they can't come out and say
[1:25:49.120 --> 1:25:51.120]  We want you to be chattel slaves now
[1:25:51.120 --> 1:25:53.120]  They've already bankrupted the world
[1:25:55.120 --> 1:25:57.120]  Many times over
[1:25:57.120 --> 1:25:59.120]  And it's been done by fraud
[1:25:59.120 --> 1:26:01.120]  And they've already completely taken over the third world
[1:26:01.120 --> 1:26:03.120]  And so they come back and say
[1:26:03.120 --> 1:26:05.120]  Oh, we want to give money to the third world
[1:26:05.120 --> 1:26:06.120]  And then you read the treaty
[1:26:06.120 --> 1:26:10.120]  It's 30% compounded interest loans
[1:26:10.120 --> 1:26:12.120]  So they tax the west
[1:26:12.120 --> 1:26:15.120]  Send money to the third world
[1:26:15.120 --> 1:26:18.120]  With 30% or higher compounded interest
[1:26:18.120 --> 1:26:20.120]  And say we won't loan you this money
[1:26:20.120 --> 1:26:22.120]  Unless you sterilize your people
[1:26:22.120 --> 1:26:24.120]  And shut down factories
[1:26:26.120 --> 1:26:28.120]  The corrupt dictators and thugs
[1:26:28.120 --> 1:26:31.120]  That run the third world cess pits
[1:26:32.120 --> 1:26:34.120]  That we're fast becoming
[1:26:34.120 --> 1:26:35.120]  Because of corruption
[1:26:35.120 --> 1:26:37.120]  That's why they can't get up off their feet
[1:26:37.120 --> 1:26:39.120]  Can't get up off their butts
[1:26:39.120 --> 1:26:41.120]  Because they're literally under corruption
[1:26:41.120 --> 1:26:43.120]  These countries use corruption
[1:26:43.120 --> 1:26:45.120]  As a way to keep control of people
[1:26:47.120 --> 1:26:49.120]  They work to keep them poor
[1:26:49.120 --> 1:26:51.120]  This has been the stated control system
[1:26:51.120 --> 1:26:53.120]  Of empires for 5,000 years
[1:26:55.120 --> 1:26:57.120]  There were books written by the Babylonians
[1:26:57.120 --> 1:26:59.120]  Books written by the Romans
[1:26:59.120 --> 1:27:01.120]  I have read them
[1:27:01.120 --> 1:27:03.120]  On how to control people
[1:27:03.120 --> 1:27:05.120]  And you don't think the governments
[1:27:05.120 --> 1:27:07.120]  Know how to do that today?
[1:27:07.120 --> 1:27:09.120]  Oh, we have their current documents
[1:27:09.120 --> 1:27:11.120]  Where they say they want to wreck
[1:27:11.120 --> 1:27:14.120]  The industrial society to make you dependent on them
[1:27:14.120 --> 1:27:16.120]  The government doesn't want your tax money
[1:27:16.120 --> 1:27:18.120]  They want to own you
[1:27:18.120 --> 1:27:19.120]  Period!
[1:27:19.120 --> 1:27:21.120]  They are parasites
[1:27:22.120 --> 1:27:25.120]  And right now, this is being established
[1:27:25.120 --> 1:27:27.120]  Right now
[1:27:28.120 --> 1:27:30.120]  It's being set up
[1:27:30.120 --> 1:27:32.120]  World government is being born
[1:27:32.120 --> 1:27:33.120]  Everybody's asking me
[1:27:33.120 --> 1:27:35.120]  Well, Alex, is it going to pass?
[1:27:35.120 --> 1:27:37.120]  And the answer is yes
[1:27:37.120 --> 1:27:39.120]  Yes
[1:27:39.120 --> 1:27:41.120]  They've already got an accepted draft
[1:27:41.120 --> 1:27:43.120]  And they keep adding to it
[1:27:43.120 --> 1:27:45.120]  But what's currently been accepted
[1:27:45.120 --> 1:27:47.120]  What's currently been signed off on
[1:27:47.120 --> 1:27:49.120]  According to the UN itself
[1:27:49.120 --> 1:27:50.120]  The London Guardian
[1:27:50.120 --> 1:27:52.120]  And Paul Watson has reports on this right now
[1:27:52.120 --> 1:27:54.120]  At infowars.com
[1:27:57.120 --> 1:27:59.120]  What's been signed off on
[1:27:59.120 --> 1:28:00.120]  Right now
[1:28:00.120 --> 1:28:02.120]  Establishes a planetary
[1:28:02.120 --> 1:28:04.120]  Government
[1:28:04.120 --> 1:28:07.120]  That levies taxes over nations
[1:28:07.120 --> 1:28:09.120]  On all financial transfers
[1:28:09.120 --> 1:28:11.120]  And travel
[1:28:11.120 --> 1:28:13.120]  And they're adding more
[1:28:13.120 --> 1:28:15.120]  All day long into the night
[1:28:15.120 --> 1:28:18.120]  They're seven hours ahead of
[1:28:18.120 --> 1:28:19.120]  Central time
[1:28:19.120 --> 1:28:21.120]  Six hours ahead of eastern time
[1:28:21.120 --> 1:28:23.120]  And they're saying they're going to work through
[1:28:23.120 --> 1:28:25.120]  The night on this agreement
[1:28:25.120 --> 1:28:27.120]  And they want to leave it vague
[1:28:27.120 --> 1:28:28.120]  You just...
[1:28:28.120 --> 1:28:30.120]  They put out a vague agreement
[1:28:30.120 --> 1:28:31.120]  The country signed on to it
[1:28:31.120 --> 1:28:34.120]  And the UN can do whatever they want
[1:28:34.120 --> 1:28:37.120]  Now, that's what's going on right now
[1:28:39.120 --> 1:28:41.120]  Key article by Paul Joseph Watson
[1:28:41.120 --> 1:28:43.120]  Final Copenhagen text
[1:28:43.120 --> 1:28:45.120]  Includes global transaction
[1:28:45.120 --> 1:28:47.120]  Tax and more
[1:28:50.120 --> 1:28:52.120]  Another headline
[1:28:52.120 --> 1:28:54.120]  Is the European police state
[1:28:54.120 --> 1:28:55.120]  Going global
[1:28:55.120 --> 1:28:58.120]  By Viscount Moncton of Brentchley
[1:28:58.120 --> 1:29:00.120]  See, now we're finally talking
[1:29:00.120 --> 1:29:01.120]  About real issues
[1:29:01.120 --> 1:29:03.120]  Global police states
[1:29:03.120 --> 1:29:05.120]  Global one-child policies
[1:29:05.120 --> 1:29:07.120]  Global armies
[1:29:07.120 --> 1:29:08.120]  Global taxes
[1:29:08.120 --> 1:29:10.120]  It's all out in the open
[1:29:10.120 --> 1:29:12.120]  They stalled you as long as they could
[1:29:12.120 --> 1:29:14.120]  As they were moving their armies up
[1:29:14.120 --> 1:29:15.120]  Moving their tanks up
[1:29:15.120 --> 1:29:16.120]  Moving their artillery up
[1:29:16.120 --> 1:29:18.120]  Telling you, oh, we're not going to attack you
[1:29:18.120 --> 1:29:20.120]  It's the equivalent of that
[1:29:20.120 --> 1:29:22.120]  And now they open fire with their full
[1:29:22.120 --> 1:29:23.120]  Barrage
[1:29:23.120 --> 1:29:25.120]  Thousands of artillery pieces
[1:29:25.120 --> 1:29:26.120]  Tanks rolling across
[1:29:26.120 --> 1:29:27.120]  Shock troops
[1:29:27.120 --> 1:29:29.120]  Machine gunning us in our
[1:29:29.120 --> 1:29:30.120]  Foxholes
[1:29:30.120 --> 1:29:31.120]  Full globalist assault
[1:29:31.120 --> 1:29:33.120]  Overrunning us right now
[1:29:33.120 --> 1:29:35.120]  But thank God
[1:29:35.120 --> 1:29:36.120]  A lot of us went out
[1:29:36.120 --> 1:29:38.120]  And warned everybody about this
[1:29:38.120 --> 1:29:40.120]  And so a lot of our people were ready
[1:29:40.120 --> 1:29:41.120]  And we are repulsing
[1:29:41.120 --> 1:29:43.120]  A lot of these attacks
[1:29:43.120 --> 1:29:45.120]  But we're fighting for our lives
[1:29:45.120 --> 1:30:01.120]  Fighting for freedom right now
[1:30:15.120 --> 1:30:17.120]  In the name of smart grid technology
[1:30:17.120 --> 1:30:18.120]  Is coming
[1:30:18.120 --> 1:30:19.120]  Number three
[1:30:19.120 --> 1:30:20.120]  In some areas of the country
[1:30:20.120 --> 1:30:22.120]  The power grid is dangerously overloaded
[1:30:22.120 --> 1:30:24.120]  And now a new socialist legislation
[1:30:24.120 --> 1:30:26.120]  Is only compounding the problem
[1:30:26.120 --> 1:30:27.120]  Number four
[1:30:27.120 --> 1:30:29.120]  Dangerous weather is always a threat
[1:30:29.120 --> 1:30:30.120]  To local grids
[1:30:30.120 --> 1:30:31.120]  Every year, thousands of families
[1:30:31.120 --> 1:30:32.120]  Lose their power
[1:30:32.120 --> 1:30:33.120]  From weather-related onages
[1:30:33.120 --> 1:30:34.120]  Number five
[1:30:34.120 --> 1:30:35.120]  A solar power generator
[1:30:35.120 --> 1:30:37.120]  Provides powerful backup insurance
[1:30:37.120 --> 1:30:38.120]  And peace of mind
[1:30:38.120 --> 1:30:39.120]  Folks, I really believe
[1:30:39.120 --> 1:30:40.120]  In the solar power generators
[1:30:40.120 --> 1:30:42.120]  Offered by Solutions from Science
[1:30:42.120 --> 1:30:43.120]  One of my old sponsors

[1:30:45.120 --> 1:30:47.120]  At www.mysolarbackup.com
[1:30:47.120 --> 1:30:49.120]  That's mysolarbackup.com
[1:30:49.120 --> 1:30:51.120]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun
[1:30:51.120 --> 1:30:53.120]  So go to mysolarbackup.com
[1:30:53.120 --> 1:30:57.120]  Or call 1-877-327-0365
[1:30:57.120 --> 1:30:59.120]  Hello, this is Alex Jones
[1:30:59.120 --> 1:31:01.120]  With some important questions
[1:31:01.120 --> 1:31:02.120]  If you're going into a battle
[1:31:02.120 --> 1:31:04.120]  And they give you a rifle and a sidearm
[1:31:04.120 --> 1:31:06.120]  How much ammunition do you want?
[1:31:06.120 --> 1:31:08.120]  My answer would be all I can get
[1:31:08.120 --> 1:31:10.120]  In the battle for freedom
[1:31:10.120 --> 1:31:12.120]  And the lives of your loved ones
[1:31:12.120 --> 1:31:14.120]  Food is your only ammunition
[1:31:14.120 --> 1:31:15.120]  How much do you want?
[1:31:15.120 --> 1:31:16.120]  When do you want it?
[1:31:16.120 --> 1:31:18.120]  Now or after the battle starts
[1:31:18.120 --> 1:31:19.120]  When will you need it?
[1:31:19.120 --> 1:31:21.120]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[1:31:21.120 --> 1:31:23.120]  Will there be any food?
[1:31:23.120 --> 1:31:24.120]  Will it make your children sick?
[1:31:24.120 --> 1:31:25.120]  If there's a quarantine
[1:31:25.120 --> 1:31:27.120]  And you can't feed yourself
[1:31:27.120 --> 1:31:28.120]  Will you go to the gathering center
[1:31:28.120 --> 1:31:29.120]  And be immunized?
[1:31:29.120 --> 1:31:31.120]  You wipe out all these problems
[1:31:31.120 --> 1:31:33.120]  If you have a good food supply
[1:31:33.120 --> 1:31:34.120]  Food is your ammunition
[1:31:34.120 --> 1:31:37.120]  To fight for your freedom and your life
[1:31:37.120 --> 1:31:38.120]  How much will you need?
[1:31:38.120 --> 1:31:39.120]  We don't know
[1:31:39.120 --> 1:31:40.120]  How much do you want?
[1:31:40.120 --> 1:31:41.120]  All you can get
[1:31:41.120 --> 1:31:42.120]  I'm Alex Jones
[1:31:42.120 --> 1:31:43.120]  I want all of you good guys

[1:31:50.120 --> 1:31:52.120]  At eFoodsDirect.com

[1:31:57.120 --> 1:31:59.120]  The illusion created by the power elite
[1:31:59.120 --> 1:32:00.120]  Is a lie
[1:32:00.120 --> 1:32:02.120]  That covers even the food they want you to eat
[1:32:02.120 --> 1:32:04.120]  Will you continue to be their profit center
[1:32:04.120 --> 1:32:07.120]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick
[1:32:07.120 --> 1:32:09.120]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs
[1:32:09.120 --> 1:32:11.120]  You don't have to cooperate
[1:32:11.120 --> 1:32:12.120]  There is a solution

[1:32:31.120 --> 1:32:33.120]  From our friend Mike Adams
[1:32:33.120 --> 1:32:34.120]  The health ranger
[1:32:34.120 --> 1:32:35.120]  I love their NutriCafe

[1:33:14.120 --> 1:33:15.120]  The devil went down to Georgia
[1:33:15.120 --> 1:33:17.120]  He was looking for a soul to steal
[1:33:17.120 --> 1:33:18.120]  He was in a bag
[1:33:18.120 --> 1:33:19.120]  Because he was way behind
[1:33:19.120 --> 1:33:21.120]  And he was willing to make a deal
[1:33:21.120 --> 1:33:22.120]  When he came across this young man
[1:33:22.120 --> 1:33:24.120]  Sewing on a fiddle and playing it hot
[1:33:24.120 --> 1:33:26.120]  And the devil jumped up on a hickory stumps
[1:33:26.120 --> 1:33:28.120]  And boy, let me tell you what
[1:33:28.120 --> 1:33:29.120]  I guess you didn't know it
[1:33:29.120 --> 1:33:31.120]  But I'm a fiddle player too
[1:33:31.120 --> 1:33:33.120]  And if you'd care to take a dare
[1:33:33.120 --> 1:33:35.120]  I'll make a bet with you
[1:33:35.120 --> 1:33:37.120]  Now you played pretty good fiddle, boy
[1:33:37.120 --> 1:33:38.120]  But give the devil his due
[1:33:38.120 --> 1:33:40.120]  I bet a fiddle of gold against your soul
[1:33:40.120 --> 1:33:42.120]  Because I think I'm better than you
[1:33:42.120 --> 1:33:44.120]  The boy said, my name's Johnny
[1:33:44.120 --> 1:33:45.120]  And it might be a sin
[1:33:45.120 --> 1:33:46.120]  But I'll take your bet
[1:33:46.120 --> 1:33:47.120]  And you're gonna regret
[1:33:47.120 --> 1:33:49.120]  Cause I'm the best it's ever been
[1:33:49.120 --> 1:33:52.120]  Johnny, rise and up your foe
[1:33:52.120 --> 1:33:53.120]  And play a fiddle hard
[1:33:53.120 --> 1:33:55.120]  Cause hell's provoking Georgia
[1:33:55.120 --> 1:33:57.120]  And the devil deals with cards
[1:33:57.120 --> 1:33:59.120]  And if you win, you get the shiny fiddle
[1:33:59.120 --> 1:34:00.120]  And let him go
[1:34:00.120 --> 1:34:05.120]  But if you lose, the devil gets your soul
[1:34:05.120 --> 1:34:07.120]  Monday through Friday
[1:34:07.120 --> 1:34:09.120]  From 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
[1:34:09.120 --> 1:34:10.120]  Central Standard Time
[1:34:10.120 --> 1:34:11.120]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[1:34:11.120 --> 1:34:13.120]  Eastern, we are here live
[1:34:13.120 --> 1:34:15.120]  I want to thank all of our great
[1:34:15.120 --> 1:34:16.120]  AM and FM affiliates
[1:34:16.120 --> 1:34:17.120]  Getting a lot of new affiliates
[1:34:17.120 --> 1:34:19.120]  I want to thank the shortwave affiliate
[1:34:19.120 --> 1:34:20.120]  As well, WWCR
[1:34:20.120 --> 1:34:22.120]  Number one internet radio show
[1:34:22.120 --> 1:34:24.120]  As well at infowars.com
[1:34:24.120 --> 1:34:26.120]  And prisonplanet.com
[1:34:26.120 --> 1:34:27.120]  A lot of people say they have
[1:34:27.120 --> 1:34:29.120]  The number one internet radio show
[1:34:29.120 --> 1:34:30.120]  But we really do
[1:34:30.120 --> 1:34:31.120]  According to shout caps
[1:34:31.120 --> 1:34:32.120]  And all the other gauges
[1:34:32.120 --> 1:34:33.120]  Just go look
[1:34:33.120 --> 1:34:35.120]  I see these shows that have like
[1:34:35.120 --> 1:34:37.120]  10 listeners saying they're number one
[1:34:37.120 --> 1:34:38.120]  We're number one
[1:34:38.120 --> 1:34:42.120]  With over 400,000 internet radio listeners a day
[1:34:42.120 --> 1:34:45.120]  Side issue, I hardly ever talk about that
[1:34:45.120 --> 1:34:47.120]  I just thought I would throw that
[1:34:47.120 --> 1:34:50.120]  Factoid out there at you
[1:34:50.120 --> 1:34:51.120]  And over 200,000 people a day
[1:34:51.120 --> 1:34:53.120]  Tuning in to the free podcast
[1:34:53.120 --> 1:34:56.120]  Subscribing to that at infowars.com
[1:34:56.120 --> 1:34:58.120]  And the listen page as well
[1:34:58.120 --> 1:35:00.120]  Okay, for the balance of this hour
[1:35:00.120 --> 1:35:02.120]  I thought we'd get into
[1:35:02.120 --> 1:35:04.120]  The latest on the climate gate
[1:35:04.120 --> 1:35:07.120]  The fraud, a long list of frauds
[1:35:07.120 --> 1:35:09.120]  Santa at the UN and others
[1:35:09.120 --> 1:35:11.120]  Admittingly now coming out
[1:35:11.120 --> 1:35:13.120]  And saying that they altered UN reports
[1:35:13.120 --> 1:35:14.120]  That's on top of climate gate
[1:35:14.120 --> 1:35:16.120]  That just broke Wednesday
[1:35:16.120 --> 1:35:18.120]  On Jesse Ventura's new TV show
[1:35:18.120 --> 1:35:20.120]  Santa admitted it in an interview
[1:35:20.120 --> 1:35:22.120]  We also are going to be talking
[1:35:22.120 --> 1:35:24.120]  About the science behind it
[1:35:24.120 --> 1:35:25.120]  And we're also going to be talking about
[1:35:25.120 --> 1:35:27.120]  The latest in Copenhagen
[1:35:27.120 --> 1:35:30.120]  As open world government is being announced
[1:35:30.120 --> 1:35:32.120]  And it looks like established
[1:35:32.120 --> 1:35:34.120]  We've got to fight this fraud
[1:35:34.120 --> 1:35:36.120]  Pierce Corbin is a leading
[1:35:36.120 --> 1:35:38.120]  I set out to find someone
[1:35:38.120 --> 1:35:40.120]  Who is known as a leading meteorologist
[1:35:40.120 --> 1:35:43.120]  Astrophysicist, I mean the degrees
[1:35:43.120 --> 1:35:45.120]  Go on and on
[1:35:45.120 --> 1:35:47.120]  And from all the experts
[1:35:47.120 --> 1:35:49.120]  I've talked to and looked at
[1:35:49.120 --> 1:35:51.120]  He's one of the top forecasters
[1:35:51.120 --> 1:35:54.120]  Who has accurately been forecasting
[1:35:54.120 --> 1:35:57.120]  Weather at levels much more accurate
[1:35:57.120 --> 1:35:59.120]  Than even governments and NASA and others
[1:35:59.120 --> 1:36:01.120]  So he's here to explain to us today
[1:36:01.120 --> 1:36:03.120]  How he's been able to do that as well
[1:36:03.120 --> 1:36:05.120]  Weatheraction.com
[1:36:05.120 --> 1:36:08.120]  But Mr. Corbin's
[1:36:08.120 --> 1:36:11.120]  The British press calls you Dr. Corbin
[1:36:11.120 --> 1:36:13.120]  And it all gets confusing with all these different
[1:36:13.120 --> 1:36:15.120]  Scientific areas you're an expert in
[1:36:15.120 --> 1:36:18.120]  But in a nutshell, tell us your main area of study
[1:36:18.120 --> 1:36:20.120]  About weather action
[1:36:20.120 --> 1:36:24.120]  And then the fraud of man made climate change
[1:36:24.120 --> 1:36:26.120]  Yes, well I got a first class degree
[1:36:26.120 --> 1:36:28.120]  From Imperial College in physics
[1:36:28.120 --> 1:36:30.120]  And then went on and did astrophysics
[1:36:30.120 --> 1:36:32.120]  At Queen Mary College in London
[1:36:32.120 --> 1:36:34.120]  These are both in London
[1:36:34.120 --> 1:36:37.120]  And I developed from that
[1:36:37.120 --> 1:36:39.120]  Into studying the sun
[1:36:39.120 --> 1:36:41.120]  Affects the earth's weather
[1:36:41.120 --> 1:36:43.120]  And after some years of study
[1:36:43.120 --> 1:36:45.120]  In all sorts of ideas
[1:36:45.120 --> 1:36:49.120]  We developed this method for long range weather forecasting
[1:36:49.120 --> 1:36:52.120]  Called the solar weather technique
[1:36:52.120 --> 1:36:56.120]  Which depends on the magnetic particles
[1:36:56.120 --> 1:36:58.120]  Coming from the sun
[1:36:58.120 --> 1:37:01.120]  And how they change circulation patterns on earth
[1:37:01.120 --> 1:37:04.120]  Subject to certain modulations
[1:37:04.120 --> 1:37:08.120]  Such as what the moon is doing as well
[1:37:08.120 --> 1:37:11.120]  And it, I mean from studying
[1:37:11.120 --> 1:37:13.120]  Most of the scientists we talk to
[1:37:13.120 --> 1:37:15.120]  More and more say the evidence is showing
[1:37:15.120 --> 1:37:18.120]  That the sun is one of the main drivers
[1:37:18.120 --> 1:37:20.120]  But the UN again on Monday
[1:37:20.120 --> 1:37:23.120]  Just declared as if they were the pope
[1:37:23.120 --> 1:37:25.120]  Saying the earth is the center of the universe
[1:37:25.120 --> 1:37:27.120]  In flat, they announced that the sun
[1:37:27.120 --> 1:37:29.120]  Has nothing to do with it
[1:37:29.120 --> 1:37:31.120]  Yes, well they would wouldn't they
[1:37:31.120 --> 1:37:33.120]  Because they have another agenda
[1:37:33.120 --> 1:37:37.120]  Now we know that what they say is failed science
[1:37:37.120 --> 1:37:40.120]  Based on fraudulent data
[1:37:40.120 --> 1:37:44.120]  And we know from our own measurements
[1:37:44.120 --> 1:37:48.120]  And the actual experience that the sun is the main
[1:37:48.120 --> 1:37:52.120]  Of the prime driver of all weather change
[1:37:52.120 --> 1:37:56.120]  On the earth and carbon dioxide has nothing
[1:37:56.120 --> 1:38:01.120]  Absolutely nothing, zero, zero influence
[1:38:01.120 --> 1:38:03.120]  For whatever reason to do with feedbacks or whatever
[1:38:03.120 --> 1:38:05.120]  But it has no influence
[1:38:05.120 --> 1:38:08.120]  And am I right doctor in saying it is one of the lowest
[1:38:08.120 --> 1:38:10.120]  Trace gases in the atmosphere?
[1:38:10.120 --> 1:38:15.120]  That's right, yes, there's only one part in 3,000
[1:38:15.120 --> 1:38:18.120]  Is carbon dioxide
[1:38:18.120 --> 1:38:21.120]  Now of course they argue all sorts of critical processes
[1:38:21.120 --> 1:38:24.120]  But we say well show us the evidence
[1:38:24.120 --> 1:38:26.120]  Actual observational evidence that carbon dioxide
[1:38:26.120 --> 1:38:29.120]  Derives temperatures and extreme events
[1:38:29.120 --> 1:38:30.120]  And there is none
[1:38:30.120 --> 1:38:33.120]  And I was on Russian TV a few days ago
[1:38:33.120 --> 1:38:36.120]  Pointing at somebody from the United Nations
[1:38:36.120 --> 1:38:38.120]  Climate Committee, the IPCC
[1:38:38.120 --> 1:38:40.120]  And said all right if you have the evidence
[1:38:40.120 --> 1:38:43.120]  Email it to me and I gave him my email address
[1:38:43.120 --> 1:38:45.120]  Peers at weatheraction.com on the air
[1:38:45.120 --> 1:38:47.120]  And so far he's emailed nothing
[1:38:47.120 --> 1:38:50.120]  And of course he won't because there is no evidence
[1:38:50.120 --> 1:38:52.120]  Well most of these guys know it's fraud
[1:38:52.120 --> 1:38:55.120]  I've talked to a lot of them at events on the street
[1:38:55.120 --> 1:38:57.120]  At smart growth conferences
[1:38:57.120 --> 1:39:01.120]  And they just off camera laugh and say
[1:39:01.120 --> 1:39:03.120]  And say buddy we're getting rich
[1:39:03.120 --> 1:39:05.120]  I mean this is just a band of criminals
[1:39:05.120 --> 1:39:07.120]  It is cynical, yeah
[1:39:07.120 --> 1:39:08.120]  I mean I know some of them
[1:39:08.120 --> 1:39:10.120]  You know friends of mine in some sense
[1:39:10.120 --> 1:39:12.120]  Or they were friends of mine saying well Peers
[1:39:12.120 --> 1:39:14.120]  You know they're quite open
[1:39:14.120 --> 1:39:16.120]  And you may well be right
[1:39:16.120 --> 1:39:17.120]  And they might say you are right
[1:39:17.120 --> 1:39:20.120]  But I've got mouths to feed
[1:39:20.120 --> 1:39:23.120]  And you know they'll go on this gravy train
[1:39:23.120 --> 1:39:25.120]  For as long as it's there
[1:39:25.120 --> 1:39:27.120]  Which is a scandalous of course
[1:39:27.120 --> 1:39:29.120]  Scandalous of something we believe
[1:39:29.120 --> 1:39:32.120]  In weather action that all science
[1:39:32.120 --> 1:39:36.120]  And policy making has to be evidence based
[1:39:36.120 --> 1:39:39.120]  And this is not evidence based
[1:39:39.120 --> 1:39:41.120]  It's based on fraud and as you mentioned
[1:39:41.120 --> 1:39:43.120]  There's been a whole lot of revelations
[1:39:43.120 --> 1:39:46.120]  Coming out of the fraud
[1:39:46.120 --> 1:39:48.120]  Not just that the University of East Anglia
[1:39:48.120 --> 1:39:51.120]  Have been meddling with data to make their
[1:39:51.120 --> 1:39:54.120]  Bizarre little models fit history
[1:39:54.120 --> 1:39:56.120]  And rub out the medieval war period
[1:39:56.120 --> 1:39:58.120]  But we now know for example in New Zealand
[1:39:58.120 --> 1:40:02.120]  Data was chosen so that although the real data
[1:40:02.120 --> 1:40:04.120]  Showed a falling of temperatures
[1:40:04.120 --> 1:40:08.120]  Of 0.7 degrees centigrade per century
[1:40:08.120 --> 1:40:10.120]  They fitted it to turn it into a rising
[1:40:10.120 --> 1:40:14.120]  Of 1.2 degrees per century
[1:40:14.120 --> 1:40:16.120]  And we now know that in Russia
[1:40:16.120 --> 1:40:20.120]  They selected Russian weather stations
[1:40:20.120 --> 1:40:23.120]  To choose the ones which were nearest
[1:40:23.120 --> 1:40:25.120]  To what they wanted so they threw away
[1:40:25.120 --> 1:40:28.120]  75% of the Russian data
[1:40:28.120 --> 1:40:30.120]  And the Russians nicely announced this
[1:40:30.120 --> 1:40:33.120]  A few days ago at the same time
[1:40:33.120 --> 1:40:35.120]  As a cold blast of air
[1:40:35.120 --> 1:40:37.120]  Wacked through Copenhagen
[1:40:37.120 --> 1:40:40.120]  To England bringing in blizzards on the way
[1:40:40.120 --> 1:40:43.120]  At the same time as Obama landed
[1:40:43.120 --> 1:40:45.120]  And we in fact at weather action
[1:40:45.120 --> 1:40:48.120]  Had forecasted just these blizzards
[1:40:48.120 --> 1:40:51.120]  In detail from 30 days ahead
[1:40:51.120 --> 1:40:53.120]  Although the general idea is we often
[1:40:53.120 --> 1:40:55.120]  Focused from longer ahead
[1:40:55.120 --> 1:40:57.120]  Now one of their favorite tricks is
[1:40:57.120 --> 1:40:59.120]  You have hundreds of thousands of different
[1:40:59.120 --> 1:41:01.120]  Sub-weather systems according to what I've read
[1:41:01.120 --> 1:41:03.120]  Correct me if I'm wrong
[1:41:03.120 --> 1:41:05.120]  And they will just pick one little area
[1:41:05.120 --> 1:41:07.120]  That's having extreme weather but you're always
[1:41:07.120 --> 1:41:09.120]  Out of thousands of different areas
[1:41:09.120 --> 1:41:11.120]  Going to be able to find a few areas
[1:41:11.120 --> 1:41:13.120]  That are having extreme weather
[1:41:13.120 --> 1:41:14.120]  That is normal
[1:41:14.120 --> 1:41:16.120]  Absolutely yes you see
[1:41:16.120 --> 1:41:18.120]  Because you know every town and city
[1:41:18.120 --> 1:41:20.120]  Has got a maximum and minimum of wet
[1:41:20.120 --> 1:41:22.120]  You know an amount of rainfall
[1:41:22.120 --> 1:41:24.120]  And so on so you go around the world
[1:41:24.120 --> 1:41:26.120]  In any year or month you can find
[1:41:26.120 --> 1:41:28.120]  Somebody who's got an extreme and you can
[1:41:28.120 --> 1:41:29.120]  Announce it
[1:41:29.120 --> 1:41:31.120]  Which of course isn't just nonsense
[1:41:31.120 --> 1:41:33.120]  Whereas at weather action
[1:41:33.120 --> 1:41:35.120]  From a long time ahead we can announce
[1:41:35.120 --> 1:41:37.120]  Periods, very short periods
[1:41:37.120 --> 1:41:39.120]  Around the world where there will be
[1:41:39.120 --> 1:41:42.120]  A whole lot of simultaneous
[1:41:42.120 --> 1:41:44.120]  More or less simultaneous
[1:41:44.120 --> 1:41:46.120]  Weather extreme events
[1:41:46.120 --> 1:41:48.120]  Which happen for example from the 17th to 19th
[1:41:48.120 --> 1:41:50.120]  Of November this year there were
[1:41:50.120 --> 1:41:52.120]  Enormous storms and deluges
[1:41:52.120 --> 1:41:54.120]  Not known in the USA
[1:41:54.120 --> 1:41:57.120]  In Africa, India, Australia
[1:41:57.120 --> 1:41:59.120]  And Europe
[1:41:59.120 --> 1:42:01.120]  And we predicted those a long time ahead
[1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:03.120]  So you know there are real extremes
[1:42:03.120 --> 1:42:05.120]  Going on and those type of things
[1:42:05.120 --> 1:42:06.120]  They cannot predict
[1:42:06.120 --> 1:42:08.120]  All they can do later after
[1:42:08.120 --> 1:42:10.120]  Something is say oh there's an extreme
[1:42:10.120 --> 1:42:11.120]  That must be CO2
[1:42:11.120 --> 1:42:13.120]  Well shifting gears with appears Corbin
[1:42:13.120 --> 1:42:14.120]  Shifting gears sir
[1:42:14.120 --> 1:42:16.120]  Why have you been so accurate
[1:42:16.120 --> 1:42:18.120]  With long term forecasting
[1:42:18.120 --> 1:42:20.120]  At weatheraction.com
[1:42:20.120 --> 1:42:22.120]  Well the reason why we're accurate
[1:42:22.120 --> 1:42:24.120]  Is because we understand
[1:42:24.120 --> 1:42:27.120]  The essential nature of the
[1:42:27.120 --> 1:42:29.120]  Magnetic and particle relationship
[1:42:29.120 --> 1:42:32.120]  Which drives the earth's
[1:42:32.120 --> 1:42:34.120]  Weather and climate
[1:42:34.120 --> 1:42:37.120]  Now obviously it's
[1:42:37.120 --> 1:42:39.120]  Vastly complicated so we don't
[1:42:39.120 --> 1:42:41.120]  Have super computers to do it
[1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:43.120]  Or models which just like financial models
[1:42:43.120 --> 1:42:44.120]  Would go wrong
[1:42:44.120 --> 1:42:46.120]  What we're able to do is
[1:42:46.120 --> 1:42:48.120]  Understanding the periods
[1:42:48.120 --> 1:42:50.120]  Of the forcing factors and the changing
[1:42:50.120 --> 1:42:52.120]  Forcing factors
[1:42:52.120 --> 1:42:54.120]  Is we can identify when in the past
[1:42:54.120 --> 1:42:56.120]  There were very similar
[1:42:56.120 --> 1:42:59.120]  Son of magnetic forcing factors
[1:42:59.120 --> 1:43:01.120]  Affect in the world
[1:43:01.120 --> 1:43:03.120]  As there will be at some time in the future
[1:43:03.120 --> 1:43:05.120]  So by knowing the past
[1:43:05.120 --> 1:43:07.120]  You know the future understanding the science
[1:43:07.120 --> 1:43:09.120]  Exactly the
[1:43:09.120 --> 1:43:11.120]  The point we make is there's nothing new
[1:43:11.120 --> 1:43:13.120]  Happening all the weather you see now
[1:43:13.120 --> 1:43:15.120]  Has happened before some time
[1:43:15.120 --> 1:43:17.120]  The definition of identify when in the past
[1:43:17.120 --> 1:43:19.120]  Is going to be very similar to some time
[1:43:19.120 --> 1:43:21.120]  In the future and it might be
[1:43:21.120 --> 1:43:23.120]  40 years ago it might be 100 years ago
[1:43:23.120 --> 1:43:25.120]  But we have ways
[1:43:25.120 --> 1:43:27.120]  Which are quite mathematically clever
[1:43:27.120 --> 1:43:29.120]  Of finding out
[1:43:29.120 --> 1:43:31.120]  Have you read about John
[1:43:31.120 --> 1:43:33.120]  Have you read about John P. Holder
[1:43:33.120 --> 1:43:35.120]  And the White House science are
[1:43:35.120 --> 1:43:37.120]  Who's also involved in the climate gate
[1:43:37.120 --> 1:43:39.120]  Emails he says they're going to
[1:43:39.120 --> 1:43:41.120]  Save us and they're always
[1:43:41.120 --> 1:43:43.120]  Saving us from something new
[1:43:43.120 --> 1:43:45.120]  With geoengineering
[1:43:45.120 --> 1:43:47.120]  Or taro farming
[1:43:47.120 --> 1:43:49.120]  He says they're doing tests to manipulate
[1:43:49.120 --> 1:43:51.120]  The weather the Russians the Chinese
[1:43:51.120 --> 1:43:53.120]  They all claim they can control the weather
[1:43:53.120 --> 1:43:55.120]  In your modeling
[1:43:55.120 --> 1:43:57.120]  I know you're looking at the entire planet
[1:43:57.120 --> 1:43:59.120]  The sun the particles
[1:43:59.120 --> 1:44:01.120]  The nuclei coming in from space
[1:44:01.120 --> 1:44:03.120]  But do you ever see anything weird going on
[1:44:03.120 --> 1:44:05.120]  Because of some of the weather
[1:44:05.120 --> 1:44:07.120]  Modification testing
[1:44:07.120 --> 1:44:09.120]  Very difficult to know
[1:44:09.120 --> 1:44:11.120]  You see
[1:44:11.120 --> 1:44:13.120]  I
[1:44:13.120 --> 1:44:15.120]  If they could really control the weather
[1:44:15.120 --> 1:44:17.120]  I don't think they'd allow a blizzard to happen
[1:44:17.120 --> 1:44:19.120]  When Obama landed in Copenhagen
[1:44:19.120 --> 1:44:21.120]  So it certainly couldn't be
[1:44:21.120 --> 1:44:23.120]  Couldn't be that good
[1:44:23.120 --> 1:44:25.120]  But I'm aware of these things
[1:44:25.120 --> 1:44:27.120]  That they are
[1:44:27.120 --> 1:44:29.120]  Doing experiments with
[1:44:29.120 --> 1:44:31.120]  I know some things do work
[1:44:31.120 --> 1:44:33.120]  To an extent
[1:44:33.120 --> 1:44:35.120]  Now there's a curious little story
[1:44:35.120 --> 1:44:37.120]  About what happened in China recently
[1:44:37.120 --> 1:44:39.120]  Because in this period the 17th
[1:44:39.120 --> 1:44:41.120]  19th of November
[1:44:41.120 --> 1:44:43.120]  Which we had predicted
[1:44:43.120 --> 1:44:45.120]  Would be a lot of extreme
[1:44:45.120 --> 1:44:47.120]  Weather
[1:44:47.120 --> 1:44:49.120]  In China there was
[1:44:49.120 --> 1:44:51.120]  Well the Chinese reported
[1:44:51.120 --> 1:44:53.120]  Three million people
[1:44:53.120 --> 1:44:55.120]  Had to be moved out of their homes
[1:44:55.120 --> 1:44:57.120]  Because of absolutely
[1:44:57.120 --> 1:44:59.120]  Massive snowstorms
[1:44:59.120 --> 1:45:01.120]  And there was also a story around
[1:45:01.120 --> 1:45:03.120]  That although there may have been
[1:45:03.120 --> 1:45:05.120]  Natural processes going on
[1:45:05.120 --> 1:45:07.120]  That they were also cloud seeding
[1:45:07.120 --> 1:45:09.120]  Time or just before
[1:45:09.120 --> 1:45:11.120]  And it had made these worse
[1:45:11.120 --> 1:45:13.120]  Now the problem is of course
[1:45:13.120 --> 1:45:15.120]  We've got no way of verifying this
[1:45:15.120 --> 1:45:17.120]  Because the Chinese government aren't going to
[1:45:17.120 --> 1:45:19.120]  Say that they did this
[1:45:19.120 --> 1:45:21.120]  Which resulted in 32 people dying
[1:45:21.120 --> 1:45:23.120]  When some buildings collapsed
[1:45:23.120 --> 1:45:25.120]  But we do know as well
[1:45:25.120 --> 1:45:27.120]  There were very real events around the world
[1:45:27.120 --> 1:45:29.120]  Which we predicted a long time ahead
[1:45:29.120 --> 1:45:31.120]  And they're based on looking back in the past
[1:45:31.120 --> 1:45:33.120]  So there's no way
[1:45:33.120 --> 1:45:35.120]  That they could have anyone
[1:45:35.120 --> 1:45:37.120]  Anyway so
[1:45:37.120 --> 1:45:39.120]  Well I tend to agree with you
[1:45:39.120 --> 1:45:41.120]  Because I've talked to Ben Livingston
[1:45:41.120 --> 1:45:43.120]  The father of weather weapons and others
[1:45:43.120 --> 1:45:45.120]  And he said they can
[1:45:45.120 --> 1:45:47.120]  With the right conditions
[1:45:47.120 --> 1:45:49.120]  They could make a hurricane
[1:45:49.120 --> 1:45:51.120]  They could strengthen one or weaken one
[1:45:51.120 --> 1:45:53.120]  But he said that when the giant
[1:45:53.120 --> 1:45:55.120]  Weather system is coming in
[1:45:55.120 --> 1:45:57.120]  That it's so huge
[1:45:57.120 --> 1:45:59.120]  That it's hard to control
[1:45:59.120 --> 1:46:01.120]  But he says in smaller areas
[1:46:01.120 --> 1:46:03.120]  They can manipulate things
[1:46:03.120 --> 1:46:05.120]  To like be triggered
[1:46:05.120 --> 1:46:07.120]  I would have thought
[1:46:07.120 --> 1:46:09.120]  Absolutely but on top of that
[1:46:09.120 --> 1:46:11.120]  It isn't that they couldn't
[1:46:11.120 --> 1:46:13.120]  Knock out a smaller snow storm
[1:46:13.120 --> 1:46:15.120]  The Russians brag they can do that
[1:46:15.120 --> 1:46:17.120]  It's that if you've got a giant northern blast
[1:46:17.120 --> 1:46:19.120]  Coming in
[1:46:19.120 --> 1:46:21.120]  It would be too big for them to manipulate
[1:46:21.120 --> 1:46:23.120]  I'm sure it can't be done
[1:46:23.120 --> 1:46:25.120]  And well
[1:46:25.120 --> 1:46:27.120]  I say never will be done
[1:46:27.120 --> 1:46:29.120]  But be careful about never
[1:46:29.120 --> 1:46:31.120]  These days you just don't know what's possible
[1:46:31.120 --> 1:46:33.120]  You know the summer
[1:46:33.120 --> 1:46:35.120]  Lunar system is vastly
[1:46:35.120 --> 1:46:37.120]  More powerful
[1:46:37.120 --> 1:46:39.120]  Than anything man can mobilize
[1:46:39.120 --> 1:46:41.120]  But of course if man can play at the critical
[1:46:41.120 --> 1:46:43.120]  Ages when something is tipping
[1:46:43.120 --> 1:46:45.120]  One way or the other then there are
[1:46:45.120 --> 1:46:47.120]  Possibilities but they only work
[1:46:47.120 --> 1:46:49.120]  At those times and those times occur
[1:46:49.120 --> 1:46:51.120]  Due to natural processes
[1:46:51.120 --> 1:46:53.120]  So any control is only limited
[1:46:53.120 --> 1:46:55.120]  To certain
[1:46:55.120 --> 1:46:57.120]  Sensitive areas such as
[1:46:57.120 --> 1:46:59.120]  When our solar weather impact periods are happening
[1:46:59.120 --> 1:47:01.120]  And those are very definitely
[1:47:01.120 --> 1:47:03.120]  So what is going on
[1:47:03.120 --> 1:47:05.120]  With the sun right now
[1:47:05.120 --> 1:47:07.120]  Why have we been cooling for 9 years
[1:47:07.120 --> 1:47:09.120]  We've been cooling
[1:47:09.120 --> 1:47:11.120]  For 9 years
[1:47:11.120 --> 1:47:13.120]  Essentially because of the
[1:47:13.120 --> 1:47:15.120]  Well
[1:47:15.120 --> 1:47:17.120]  The decline in solar activity
[1:47:17.120 --> 1:47:19.120]  And it being
[1:47:19.120 --> 1:47:21.120]  A odd sunspot cycle
[1:47:21.120 --> 1:47:23.120]  We're just leaving
[1:47:23.120 --> 1:47:25.120]  And the
[1:47:25.120 --> 1:47:27.120]  When that happens in an odd sunspot cycle
[1:47:27.120 --> 1:47:29.120]  You will get less warming
[1:47:29.120 --> 1:47:31.120]  We're also
[1:47:31.120 --> 1:47:33.120]  In the situation where the effect
[1:47:33.120 --> 1:47:35.120]  Of the moon
[1:47:35.120 --> 1:47:37.120]  Is to
[1:47:37.120 --> 1:47:39.120]  Limit the effect
[1:47:39.120 --> 1:47:41.120]  Of particles
[1:47:41.120 --> 1:47:43.120]  Which would cause warming
[1:47:45.120 --> 1:47:47.120]  When you get into an even cycle
[1:47:47.120 --> 1:47:49.120]  Things change and in fact even
[1:47:49.120 --> 1:47:51.120]  Cycles are generally colder
[1:47:51.120 --> 1:47:53.120]  Than odd cycles and we're now
[1:47:53.120 --> 1:47:55.120]  Entering an even cycle
[1:47:55.120 --> 1:47:57.120]  Sir what would
[1:47:57.120 --> 1:47:59.120]  As a leading astrophysicist
[1:47:59.120 --> 1:48:01.120]  With cycle 23
[1:48:01.120 --> 1:48:03.120]  We're just finishing and we're starting
[1:48:03.120 --> 1:48:05.120]  Cycle 24
[1:48:05.120 --> 1:48:07.120]  As a leading astrophysicist
[1:48:07.120 --> 1:48:09.120]  And someone who studies the
[1:48:09.120 --> 1:48:11.120]  The entire earth, sun, moon
[1:48:11.120 --> 1:48:13.120]  Relationship
[1:48:13.120 --> 1:48:15.120]  What type of cycle
[1:48:15.120 --> 1:48:17.120]  Or what area of the cycle were we in
[1:48:17.120 --> 1:48:19.120]  9,000 years ago
[1:48:19.120 --> 1:48:21.120]  When the warming was
[1:48:21.120 --> 1:48:23.120]  According to the graphs I've seen
[1:48:23.120 --> 1:48:25.120]  In the last century
[1:48:25.120 --> 1:48:27.120]  Right, well
[1:48:27.120 --> 1:48:29.120]  To be specific we'd have to
[1:48:29.120 --> 1:48:31.120]  Look carefully but the
[1:48:31.120 --> 1:48:33.120]  World temperature would depend on
[1:48:33.120 --> 1:48:35.120]  The solar activity
[1:48:35.120 --> 1:48:37.120]  And how well that activity
[1:48:37.120 --> 1:48:39.120]  Actually reaches earth which is
[1:48:39.120 --> 1:48:41.120]  About magnetic connectivity
[1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:43.120]  And that is going to be affected
[1:48:43.120 --> 1:48:45.120]  Not just by the 22 year
[1:48:45.120 --> 1:48:47.120]  Magnetic cycle of the sun
[1:48:47.120 --> 1:48:49.120]  But also by the close orientation
[1:48:49.120 --> 1:48:51.120]  Of the earth's axis
[1:48:51.120 --> 1:48:53.120]  Relative to the sun's
[1:48:53.120 --> 1:48:55.120]  Magnetic axis, so there's
[1:48:55.120 --> 1:48:57.120]  That question, there's a question
[1:48:57.120 --> 1:48:59.120]  Of the solar lunar things
[1:48:59.120 --> 1:49:01.120]  And then there's a question of the
[1:49:01.120 --> 1:49:03.120]  Slow cycles of
[1:49:03.120 --> 1:49:05.120]  General solar activity which
[1:49:05.120 --> 1:49:07.120]  They're not just operating on the
[1:49:07.120 --> 1:49:09.120]  Scale of 11 years or so but
[1:49:09.120 --> 1:49:11.120]  On hundreds of years
[1:49:11.120 --> 1:49:13.120]  If not many hundreds of years
[1:49:13.120 --> 1:49:15.120]  So it's going to be all those
[1:49:15.120 --> 1:49:17.120]  Combinations of the solar activity
[1:49:17.120 --> 1:49:19.120]  Lunar modulations
[1:49:19.120 --> 1:49:21.120]  Orientation
[1:49:21.120 --> 1:49:23.120]  So I couldn't be
[1:49:23.120 --> 1:49:25.120]  Specific exactly to say
[1:49:25.120 --> 1:49:27.120]  But we should
[1:49:27.120 --> 1:49:29.120]  In principle we'd be able to predict
[1:49:29.120 --> 1:49:31.120]  When in the future similar things
[1:49:31.120 --> 1:49:33.120]  Will happen again
[1:49:33.120 --> 1:49:35.120]  When will we have something
[1:49:35.120 --> 1:49:37.120]  Close to
[1:49:37.120 --> 1:49:39.120]  What happened during the beginning of the
[1:49:39.120 --> 1:49:41.120]  Bronze Age, I mean the heating up
[1:49:41.120 --> 1:49:43.120]  Maybe never because you see
[1:49:43.120 --> 1:49:45.120]  Sometime there's got to be a return
[1:49:45.120 --> 1:49:47.120]  To an ice age
[1:49:47.120 --> 1:49:49.120]  The natural state of the
[1:49:49.120 --> 1:49:51.120]  World for the last few million years
[1:49:51.120 --> 1:49:53.120]  Is ice ages with intermittent
[1:49:53.120 --> 1:49:55.120]  Warm periods lasting
[1:49:55.120 --> 1:49:57.120]  You know typically 10,000 years
[1:49:57.120 --> 1:49:59.120]  Which we're in now and we are
[1:49:59.120 --> 1:50:01.120]  You know in year 10,000
[1:50:01.120 --> 1:50:03.120]  So logically there is
[1:50:03.120 --> 1:50:05.120]  Ice age due
[1:50:05.120 --> 1:50:07.120]  Now it might have been that was almost
[1:50:07.120 --> 1:50:09.120]  An ice age coming
[1:50:09.120 --> 1:50:11.120]  At about 0 AD
[1:50:11.120 --> 1:50:13.120]  Because you know since then
[1:50:13.120 --> 1:50:15.120]  Or a thousand AD
[1:50:15.120 --> 1:50:17.120]  Since then it has been
[1:50:17.120 --> 1:50:19.120]  Notably
[1:50:19.120 --> 1:50:21.120]  Colder but we don't know
[1:50:21.120 --> 1:50:23.120]  What we can say about the next
[1:50:23.120 --> 1:50:25.120]  100 years is according to
[1:50:25.120 --> 1:50:27.120]  Our
[1:50:27.120 --> 1:50:29.120]  Theory and I don't like using the word model
[1:50:29.120 --> 1:50:31.120]  Because we know it is
[1:50:31.120 --> 1:50:33.120]  We base it on observations and equations
[1:50:33.120 --> 1:50:35.120]  Rather than playing games with computers
[1:50:35.120 --> 1:50:37.120]  Although we do use computers of course
[1:50:37.120 --> 1:50:39.120]  Our theory shows that
[1:50:39.120 --> 1:50:41.120]  We're in for
[1:50:41.120 --> 1:50:43.120]  Continuing general cooling
[1:50:43.120 --> 1:50:45.120]  There will be fluctuations in it
[1:50:45.120 --> 1:50:47.120]  But we don't expect
[1:50:47.120 --> 1:50:49.120]  To ever get to above the
[1:50:49.120 --> 1:50:51.120]  1998 level
[1:50:51.120 --> 1:50:53.120]  Amazing, let's get into their fraud
[1:50:53.120 --> 1:50:55.120]  When we come back we've got a break sir
[1:50:55.120 --> 1:50:57.120]  A Pierce Corbin as our guest
[1:50:57.120 --> 1:50:59.120]  Amazing information
[1:50:59.120 --> 1:51:01.120]  When you hear the words water purification
[1:51:01.120 --> 1:51:03.120]  What comes to mind? If it's
[1:51:03.120 --> 1:51:05.120]  Berkey water purification systems

[1:51:07.120 --> 1:51:09.120]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water
[1:51:09.120 --> 1:51:11.120]  Contains fluoride at less than
[1:51:11.120 --> 1:51:13.120]  4 gallon Berkey water filters
[1:51:13.120 --> 1:51:15.120]  Purify treated and untreated water
[1:51:15.120 --> 1:51:17.120]  Remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride
[1:51:17.120 --> 1:51:19.120]  And contaminants from municipal water
[1:51:19.120 --> 1:51:21.120]  These filters are powerful enough to purify
[1:51:21.120 --> 1:51:23.120]  Stagnant pond water, making them
[1:51:23.120 --> 1:51:25.120]  Perfect for rainwater collection systems

[1:52:03.120 --> 1:52:05.120]  This is our last chance
[1:52:05.120 --> 1:52:07.120]  To not relive history
[1:52:07.120 --> 1:52:09.120]  As we're finishing off this agenda
[1:52:09.120 --> 1:52:11.120]  We're pulling the rug from underneath
[1:52:11.120 --> 1:52:13.120]  Americans at home
[1:52:13.120 --> 1:52:15.120]  I've turned an innocent influence
[1:52:15.120 --> 1:52:17.120]  On our president in Congress
[1:52:17.120 --> 1:52:19.120]  And they really are calling the shots
[1:52:19.120 --> 1:52:21.120]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[1:52:21.120 --> 1:52:23.120]  As American citizens to pay attention
[1:52:23.120 --> 1:52:25.120]  Full of the republic identifies
[1:52:25.120 --> 1:52:27.120]  The enemies of our nation
[1:52:27.120 --> 1:52:29.120]  The criminal offshore cartel
[1:52:29.120 --> 1:52:31.120]  Hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[1:52:31.120 --> 1:52:33.120]  And on its ashes constructing world government
[1:52:33.120 --> 1:52:35.120]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists
[1:52:35.120 --> 1:52:37.120]  They're asking for more matches
[1:52:37.120 --> 1:52:39.120]  And the Congress is saying
[1:52:39.120 --> 1:52:41.120]  Who do we make the check out to?
[1:52:41.120 --> 1:52:43.120]  Today seems like nobody does care
[1:52:43.120 --> 1:52:45.120]  And right now in Washington DC
[1:52:45.120 --> 1:52:47.120]  We have seen a fall of the republic
[1:52:47.120 --> 1:52:49.120]  Yet you're copy a fall of the republic

[1:54:11.120 --> 1:54:13.120]  Because I want to talk more about
[1:54:13.120 --> 1:54:15.120]  What an ice age would look like
[1:54:15.120 --> 1:54:17.120]  Just 200 miles north of me
[1:54:17.120 --> 1:54:19.120]  Is where in the last ice age
[1:54:19.120 --> 1:54:21.120]  The main glacier ended
[1:54:21.120 --> 1:54:23.120]  In southern Oklahoma
[1:54:23.120 --> 1:54:25.120]  With the shoulders out in the middle of flat fields
[1:54:25.120 --> 1:54:27.120]  Brought there by several hundred foot
[1:54:27.120 --> 1:54:29.120]  Thick glaciers
[1:54:29.120 --> 1:54:31.120]  And all the evidence
[1:54:31.120 --> 1:54:33.120]  All the real science
[1:54:33.120 --> 1:54:35.120]  What governments really believe is
[1:54:35.120 --> 1:54:37.120]  We're going into an ice age
[1:54:37.120 --> 1:54:39.120]  They fraudulently chose warming
[1:54:39.120 --> 1:54:41.120]  Because they believed that would scare the public
[1:54:41.120 --> 1:54:43.120]  Better and people wouldn't believe an ice age was coming
[1:54:43.120 --> 1:54:45.120]  They know it's a fraud
[1:54:45.120 --> 1:54:47.120]  It's a sick cynical joke
[1:54:47.120 --> 1:54:49.120]  So our guest is coming up with us more in the next hour
[1:54:49.120 --> 1:54:51.120]  We'll talk about the scientific fraud
[1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:53.120]  The climate gait
[1:54:53.120 --> 1:54:55.120]  Some of the other frauds that haven't been as well publicized
[1:54:55.120 --> 1:54:57.120]  Before I do that
[1:54:57.120 --> 1:54:59.120]  UPS
[1:54:59.120 --> 1:55:01.120]  Can still ship to most areas of the country by Wednesday
[1:55:01.120 --> 1:55:03.120]  It's not guaranteed
[1:55:03.120 --> 1:55:05.120]  But if you order today
[1:55:05.120 --> 1:55:07.120]  We've got folks in here shipping to Mara
[1:55:07.120 --> 1:55:09.120]  Most areas will still get it in time for Christmas

[1:56:03.120 --> 1:56:05.120]  Six years

[1:56:21.120 --> 1:56:23.120]  Okay, this is a short segment
[1:56:23.120 --> 1:56:25.120]  Going back to our guest
[1:56:25.120 --> 1:56:27.120]  Finishing up with one of the leading
[1:56:27.120 --> 1:56:29.120]  Appears Corbin
[1:56:29.120 --> 1:56:31.120]  Heads up weatheraction.com
[1:56:31.120 --> 1:56:33.120]  A astrophysicist, meteorologist
[1:56:33.120 --> 1:56:35.120]  His forecast from my research
[1:56:35.120 --> 1:56:37.120]  Are among some of the most accurate out there
[1:56:37.120 --> 1:56:39.120]  Years ahead
[1:56:39.120 --> 1:56:41.120]  And he does this by knowing the history
[1:56:41.120 --> 1:56:43.120]  Those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it
[1:56:43.120 --> 1:56:45.120]  I believe Loractin said that
[1:56:45.120 --> 1:56:47.120]  Or did he say power corrupts
[1:56:47.120 --> 1:56:49.120]  Absolutely power corrupts
[1:56:49.120 --> 1:56:51.120]  He said a lot of things I think
[1:56:51.120 --> 1:56:53.120]  Exactly, we've got a few minutes left here
[1:56:53.120 --> 1:56:55.120]  We're going to come back with some longer segments
[1:56:55.120 --> 1:56:57.120]  Specifically, I understand the ice age
[1:56:57.120 --> 1:56:59.120]  Is 100, 200, 400, 500
[1:56:59.120 --> 1:57:01.120]  We just know we're due for another one
[1:57:01.120 --> 1:57:03.120]  We're going into a cooling trend now
[1:57:03.120 --> 1:57:05.120]  What would an ice age look like?
[1:57:05.120 --> 1:57:07.120]  Well, they take about a couple of thousand years
[1:57:07.120 --> 1:57:09.120]  To develop fully
[1:57:09.120 --> 1:57:11.120]  But what happens is the ice caps
[1:57:11.120 --> 1:57:13.120]  In both hemispheres would
[1:57:13.120 --> 1:57:15.120]  Increase in size and it just gets
[1:57:15.120 --> 1:57:17.120]  Progressively colder
[1:57:17.120 --> 1:57:19.120]  And the sea freezes over
[1:57:19.120 --> 1:57:21.120]  In the
[1:57:21.120 --> 1:57:23.120]  Polar regions and
[1:57:23.120 --> 1:57:25.120]  It all just makes the
[1:57:25.120 --> 1:57:27.120]  You know, moves towards the equator
[1:57:27.120 --> 1:57:29.120]  So typically across
[1:57:29.120 --> 1:57:31.120]  The United States of America
[1:57:31.120 --> 1:57:33.120]  You'd have
[1:57:33.120 --> 1:57:35.120]  An ice front
[1:57:35.120 --> 1:57:37.120]  An ice cap would extend there
[1:57:37.120 --> 1:57:39.120]  In the case of the last ice age
[1:57:39.120 --> 1:57:41.120]  In Britain it went through
[1:57:41.120 --> 1:57:43.120]  The middle of Britain
[1:57:43.120 --> 1:57:45.120]  So the south of England was actually ice
[1:57:45.120 --> 1:57:47.120]  Not ice and the
[1:57:47.120 --> 1:57:49.120]  Scotland and the whole of northern England
[1:57:49.120 --> 1:57:51.120]  And most of Ireland was covered in ice
[1:57:51.120 --> 1:57:53.120]  And you could walk to Europe
[1:57:53.120 --> 1:57:55.120]  And the whole of Russia
[1:57:55.120 --> 1:57:57.120]  Would have been covered in ice
[1:57:57.120 --> 1:57:59.120]  And Scandinavia covered in ice
[1:57:59.120 --> 1:58:01.120]  So if an ice age comes
[1:58:01.120 --> 1:58:03.120]  All those people would come south
[1:58:03.120 --> 1:58:05.120]  You'd see all the Canadians, Scandinavians
[1:58:05.120 --> 1:58:07.120]  And Russians would all come
[1:58:07.120 --> 1:58:09.120]  Or else they'd find ways of
[1:58:09.120 --> 1:58:11.120]  Overcoming this by building
[1:58:11.120 --> 1:58:13.120]  Things on the ice
[1:58:13.120 --> 1:58:15.120]  Was there a more
[1:58:15.120 --> 1:58:17.120]  Ancient ice age?
[1:58:17.120 --> 1:58:19.120]  Because I know that the ice came all the way
[1:58:19.120 --> 1:58:21.120]  Down to Texas
[1:58:21.120 --> 1:58:23.120]  So the bigger
[1:58:23.120 --> 1:58:25.120]  Ice ages came down further than the last one
[1:58:25.120 --> 1:58:27.120]  That is correct
[1:58:27.120 --> 1:58:29.120]  They've been different sizes
[1:58:29.120 --> 1:58:31.120]  And they happen typically
[1:58:31.120 --> 1:58:33.120]  Every 100,000 years
[1:58:33.120 --> 1:58:35.120]  Or 90,000 years
[1:58:35.120 --> 1:58:37.120]  Alright, we'll be right back
[1:58:37.120 --> 1:58:39.120]  Back in one minute
[1:58:39.120 --> 1:58:41.120]  America's number one stories

[1:58:49.120 --> 1:58:51.120]  And I want to tell you about the
[1:58:51.120 --> 1:58:53.120]  A cola blue atmospheric water generator
[1:58:53.120 --> 1:58:55.120]  That produces pure drinking water
[1:58:55.120 --> 1:58:57.120]  Right from the humidity in the air
[1:58:57.120 --> 1:58:59.120]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real
[1:58:59.120 --> 1:59:01.120]  I know because I use one every day in my own home
[1:59:01.120 --> 1:59:03.120]  And it's available right now to you
[1:59:03.120 --> 1:59:05.120]  And it comes from with a cola blue

[1:59:51.120 --> 1:59:53.120]  Waging war on corruption
[1:59:53.120 --> 2:00:01.120]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio
[2:00:01.120 --> 2:00:03.120]  Big brother, mainstream media
[2:00:03.120 --> 2:00:05.120]  Government cover-ups
[2:00:05.120 --> 2:00:07.120]  You want answers?
[2:00:07.120 --> 2:00:09.120]  Well, so does he
[2:00:09.120 --> 2:00:13.120]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[2:00:13.120 --> 2:00:15.120]  And now, live from Austin, Texas
[2:00:15.120 --> 2:00:17.120]  Alex Jones
[2:00:17.120 --> 2:00:19.120]  Well, for the next 20 minutes or so
[2:00:19.120 --> 2:00:21.120]  We have a preeminent
[2:00:21.120 --> 2:00:23.120]  Astrophysicist
[2:00:23.120 --> 2:00:25.120]  Meteorologist
[2:00:25.120 --> 2:00:27.120]  Pierce Corbin
[2:00:33.120 --> 2:00:35.120]  WeatherAction.com
[2:00:37.120 --> 2:00:39.120]  And we appreciate him joining us
[2:00:39.120 --> 2:00:41.120]  Okay, in the two segments we've got left
[2:00:41.120 --> 2:00:43.120]  The short one and the longer one coming up
[2:00:43.120 --> 2:00:45.120]  Specifically
[2:00:45.120 --> 2:00:47.120]  The fraud of the scientists
[2:00:47.120 --> 2:00:49.120]  I mean, you see them
[2:00:49.120 --> 2:00:51.120]  You're in England, you're around them
[2:00:51.120 --> 2:00:53.120]  But this is exposed fraud
[2:00:53.120 --> 2:00:55.120]  Throughout the United Nations system
[2:00:55.120 --> 2:00:57.120]  Where they went out and recruited
[2:00:57.120 --> 2:00:59.120]  And those documents are now public for those that don't know
[2:00:59.120 --> 2:01:01.120]  And created a premeditated fraud
[2:01:01.120 --> 2:01:03.120]  Yeah
[2:01:03.120 --> 2:01:05.120]  Well, as a scientist
[2:01:05.120 --> 2:01:07.120]  I find it utterly reprehensible
[2:01:07.120 --> 2:01:09.120]  And I'm astounded
[2:01:09.120 --> 2:01:11.120]  By the depth of it
[2:01:11.120 --> 2:01:13.120]  You know, just choosing datasets
[2:01:13.120 --> 2:01:15.120]  In New Zealand and Russia
[2:01:15.120 --> 2:01:17.120]  Just meddling with parameters
[2:01:17.120 --> 2:01:19.120]  To adjust
[2:01:19.120 --> 2:01:21.120]  Actual measured data
[2:01:21.120 --> 2:01:23.120]  Or losing actual measured data
[2:01:23.120 --> 2:01:25.120]  When they produce their so-called world forecast
[2:01:25.120 --> 2:01:27.120]  I mean, as far as we're concerned
[2:01:27.120 --> 2:01:29.120]  And not world forecast, we'll dataset
[2:01:29.120 --> 2:01:31.120]  As far as we're concerned
[2:01:31.120 --> 2:01:33.120]  The dataset produced
[2:01:33.120 --> 2:01:35.120]  For the world
[2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:37.120]  By the climate research unit
[2:01:37.120 --> 2:01:39.120]  Of the University of East Anglia is rubbish
[2:01:39.120 --> 2:01:41.120]  And we're never going to use it again
[2:01:41.120 --> 2:01:43.120]  We're instead going to try and use
[2:01:43.120 --> 2:01:45.120]  Satellite data and work with other scientists
[2:01:45.120 --> 2:01:47.120]  Around the world in order to
[2:01:47.120 --> 2:01:49.120]  Try and develop an accurate dataset
[2:01:49.120 --> 2:01:51.120]  Of what happened in the past
[2:01:51.120 --> 2:01:53.120]  Which would improve our
[2:01:53.120 --> 2:01:55.120]  Long-range forecast of climate
[2:01:55.120 --> 2:01:57.120]  And if anything, of course, it would make
[2:01:57.120 --> 2:01:59.120]  Our projections of cooling
[2:01:59.120 --> 2:02:01.120]  To even more cooling
[2:02:01.120 --> 2:02:03.120]  What does this do?
[2:02:03.120 --> 2:02:05.120]  What should be done with the scientists
[2:02:05.120 --> 2:02:07.120]  I think all those involved in this fraudulent activity
[2:02:07.120 --> 2:02:09.120]  Should be sacked
[2:02:09.120 --> 2:02:11.120]  With the demand that governments
[2:02:11.120 --> 2:02:13.120]  Do accountable
[2:02:13.120 --> 2:02:15.120]  And evidence-based science
[2:02:15.120 --> 2:02:17.120]  And policymaking
[2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:19.120]  By accountable, their data needs to be public
[2:02:19.120 --> 2:02:21.120]  I mean, that was the big red flag
[2:02:21.120 --> 2:02:23.120]  From the East Anglia facility
[2:02:23.120 --> 2:02:25.120]  Is that they wouldn't ever let anybody see their raw data
[2:02:25.120 --> 2:02:27.120]  Now they've destroyed the data
[2:02:27.120 --> 2:02:29.120]  They say they're going to give us cook
[2:02:29.120 --> 2:02:31.120]  Yeah, that's right
[2:02:31.120 --> 2:02:33.120]  Some of the data was available
[2:02:33.120 --> 2:02:35.120]  But they had these computer codes
[2:02:35.120 --> 2:02:37.120]  Which they used to allow
[2:02:37.120 --> 2:02:39.120]  For various things as they put it
[2:02:39.120 --> 2:02:41.120]  To make it more
[2:02:41.120 --> 2:02:43.120]  Accurate, well, actually
[2:02:43.120 --> 2:02:45.120]  Of course, they were doing the opposite
[2:02:45.120 --> 2:02:47.120]  Which is why they didn't want to
[2:02:47.120 --> 2:02:49.120]  Show what they were up to
[2:02:49.120 --> 2:02:51.120]  And we should take our hats off
[2:02:51.120 --> 2:02:53.120]  To the guys who released it
[2:02:53.120 --> 2:02:55.120]  However, I think it's quite likely
[2:02:55.120 --> 2:02:57.120]  It was actually an inside job
[2:02:57.120 --> 2:02:59.120]  And they were releasing the data
[2:02:59.120 --> 2:03:01.120]  In the manner they had
[2:03:01.120 --> 2:03:03.120]  In order to try and say
[2:03:03.120 --> 2:03:05.120]  That it isn't accurate and can't be trusted
[2:03:05.120 --> 2:03:07.120]  Under the Freedom of Information Act
[2:03:07.120 --> 2:03:09.120]  And we would have been able to quiz these guys directly
[2:03:09.120 --> 2:03:11.120]  Instead, one of them has stepped down
[2:03:11.120 --> 2:03:13.120]  For the time being so he can't be asked anything
[2:03:13.120 --> 2:03:15.120]  So I'm very suspicious
[2:03:15.120 --> 2:03:17.120]  Of the whole thing
[2:03:17.120 --> 2:03:19.120]  But, you know, it is now clear
[2:03:19.120 --> 2:03:21.120]  That it is failed science
[2:03:21.120 --> 2:03:23.120]  Based on fraudulent data
[2:03:23.120 --> 2:03:25.120]  And this fraud has been activated
[2:03:25.120 --> 2:03:27.120]  Around the whole world
[2:03:27.120 --> 2:03:29.120]  Well, the world's climate system
[2:03:29.120 --> 2:03:31.120]  As you know, but for the audience
[2:03:31.120 --> 2:03:33.120]  Who may not is so incredibly complex
[2:03:33.120 --> 2:03:35.120]  And not even supercomputers
[2:03:35.120 --> 2:03:37.120]  Can even begin to grasp
[2:03:37.120 --> 2:03:39.120]  But that's why you can only look
[2:03:39.120 --> 2:03:41.120]  At past systems just to understand
[2:03:41.120 --> 2:03:43.120]  Trends to forecast
[2:03:43.120 --> 2:03:45.120]  Because, I mean, here's the Christian Science Monitor
[2:03:45.120 --> 2:03:47.120]  Philippines' force evacuation
[2:03:47.120 --> 2:03:49.120]  As volcano eruption threatens
[2:03:49.120 --> 2:03:51.120]  The cities
[2:03:51.120 --> 2:03:53.120]  And, I mean, this thing is putting off
[2:03:53.120 --> 2:03:55.120]  More carbon dioxide
[2:03:55.120 --> 2:03:57.120]  Than hundreds of cities will do in a decade
[2:03:57.120 --> 2:03:59.120]  They admit that
[2:03:59.120 --> 2:04:01.120]  But then, of course, this carbon dioxide
[2:04:01.120 --> 2:04:03.120]  The forecasters are saying
[2:04:03.120 --> 2:04:05.120]  Will not have a heating effect
[2:04:05.120 --> 2:04:07.120]  It will have a cooling effect
[2:04:07.120 --> 2:04:09.120]  Yes, well, of course
[2:04:09.120 --> 2:04:11.120]  They've got a few problems there, haven't they?
[2:04:11.120 --> 2:04:13.120]  The dust indeed does make
[2:04:13.120 --> 2:04:15.120]  A cooling effect
[2:04:15.120 --> 2:04:17.120]  But there's many contradictions
[2:04:17.120 --> 2:04:19.120]  Of course, there's a lot of things going on
[2:04:19.120 --> 2:04:21.120]  Which they don't understand or don't know about
[2:04:21.120 --> 2:04:23.120]  I mean, there's a lot of undersea volcanoes
[2:04:23.120 --> 2:04:25.120]  Doing a lot of things to the sea
[2:04:25.120 --> 2:04:27.120]  For example
[2:04:27.120 --> 2:04:29.120]  And the role of volcanoes
[2:04:29.120 --> 2:04:31.120]  But we are understanding more about the sun
[2:04:31.120 --> 2:04:33.120]  As we know very clearly
[2:04:33.120 --> 2:04:35.120]  I've said before that CO2 has
[2:04:35.120 --> 2:04:37.120]  No effect, no net effect
[2:04:37.120 --> 2:04:39.120]  And if anything, it's temperatures
[2:04:39.120 --> 2:04:41.120]  That drive CO2 levels
[2:04:41.120 --> 2:04:43.120]  We've got huge volcanoes
[2:04:43.120 --> 2:04:45.120]  A giant sun radiating us
[2:04:45.120 --> 2:04:47.120]  All these other cosmic rays
[2:04:47.120 --> 2:04:49.120]  Coming in forming nuclei that form clouds
[2:04:49.120 --> 2:04:51.120]  Meanwhile, some tiny trace gas
[2:04:51.120 --> 2:04:53.120]  That's precious to plants
[2:04:53.120 --> 2:04:55.120]  Is being listed as a chemical weapon
[2:04:55.120 --> 2:04:57.120]  This is Alex Jones
[2:04:57.120 --> 2:04:59.120]  With five good reasons you should consider
[2:04:59.120 --> 2:05:01.120]  Buying a solar power generator
[2:05:01.120 --> 2:05:03.120]  Number one, new climate legislation
[2:05:03.120 --> 2:05:05.120]  Could easily double or triple your electric bill
[2:05:05.120 --> 2:05:07.120]  Number two, our new energy czar
[2:05:07.120 --> 2:05:09.120]  Wants to control how much power
[2:05:09.120 --> 2:05:11.120]  Your electric company allows you to have
[2:05:11.120 --> 2:05:13.120]  It's true, total government control
[2:05:13.120 --> 2:05:15.120]  Of electricity in the name of smart grid
[2:05:15.120 --> 2:05:17.120]  Technology is coming
[2:05:17.120 --> 2:05:19.120]  Number three, in some areas of the country
[2:05:19.120 --> 2:05:21.120]  The power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:05:21.120 --> 2:05:23.120]  And now, new socialist legislation
[2:05:23.120 --> 2:05:25.120]  Is only compounding the problem
[2:05:25.120 --> 2:05:27.120]  Number four, dangerous weather
[2:05:27.120 --> 2:05:29.120]  Is always a threat to local grids
[2:05:29.120 --> 2:05:31.120]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[2:05:31.120 --> 2:05:33.120]  From weather-related onages
[2:05:33.120 --> 2:05:35.120]  Number five, a solar power generator
[2:05:35.120 --> 2:05:37.120]  Provides powerful backup insurance
[2:05:37.120 --> 2:05:39.120]  And peace of mind
[2:05:39.120 --> 2:05:41.120]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[2:05:41.120 --> 2:05:43.120]  Offered by Solutions from Science
[2:05:43.120 --> 2:05:45.120]  One of my oldest sponsors
[2:05:45.120 --> 2:05:47.120]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[2:05:47.120 --> 2:05:49.120]  That's mysolarbackup.com
[2:05:49.120 --> 2:05:51.120]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun
[2:05:51.120 --> 2:05:53.120]  So go to mysolarbackup.com

[2:05:57.120 --> 2:05:59.120]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones
[2:05:59.120 --> 2:06:01.120]  And I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator
[2:06:01.120 --> 2:06:05.120]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[2:06:05.120 --> 2:06:07.120]  And deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[2:06:07.120 --> 2:06:09.120]  By breathing the solution through the lungs
[2:06:09.120 --> 2:06:11.120]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense
[2:06:11.120 --> 2:06:13.120]  For airborne pathogens and viruses
[2:06:13.120 --> 2:06:15.120]  The Silver Lungs Generator
[2:06:15.120 --> 2:06:17.120]  Infuses the respiratory system
[2:06:17.120 --> 2:06:19.120]  With your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[2:06:19.120 --> 2:06:21.120]  And also delivers
[2:06:21.120 --> 2:06:23.120]  The silver nanoparticles
[2:06:23.120 --> 2:06:25.120]  Instantly into the bloodstream
[2:06:25.120 --> 2:06:27.120]  With continued legislation threatening the sale
[2:06:27.120 --> 2:06:29.120]  Of nano-silver products
[2:06:29.120 --> 2:06:31.120]  You can now produce pure
[2:06:31.120 --> 2:06:33.120]  And endless colloidal silver
[2:06:33.120 --> 2:06:35.120]  With the Silver Lungs Generator
[2:06:35.120 --> 2:06:37.120]  Very easy to follow
[2:06:37.120 --> 2:06:39.120]  Step-by-step instructions are provided
[2:06:39.120 --> 2:06:41.120]  Making production fast and simple

[2:06:49.120 --> 2:06:51.120]  www.silverlungs.com
[2:07:19.120 --> 2:07:21.120]  www.silverlungs.com
[2:07:49.120 --> 2:07:51.120]  We're watching online right now
[2:07:51.120 --> 2:08:20.120]  In super high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[2:08:20.120 --> 2:08:25.120]  And as one of the most accurate track records out there
[2:08:25.120 --> 2:08:28.120]  www.weatheraction.com
[2:08:28.120 --> 2:08:30.120]  And he's not just breaking down
[2:08:30.120 --> 2:08:31.120]  Climate Gate or Copenhagen
[2:08:31.120 --> 2:08:33.120]  Before he leaves us at the end of this segment
[2:08:33.120 --> 2:08:35.120]  He's going to give us his forecast
[2:08:35.120 --> 2:08:37.120]  In the next few months for extreme weather
[2:08:37.120 --> 2:08:38.120]  Around the world
[2:08:38.120 --> 2:08:40.120]  And into the next year
[2:08:40.120 --> 2:08:41.120]  And you can write it down
[2:08:41.120 --> 2:08:43.120]  And check on it later
[2:08:43.120 --> 2:08:45.120]  Or go to his site and subscribe
[2:08:45.120 --> 2:08:47.120]  To get more detailed weather forecasts
[2:08:47.120 --> 2:08:50.120]  In your area, long-term weather forecasting
[2:08:50.120 --> 2:08:53.120]  From www.weatheraction.com
[2:08:53.120 --> 2:08:54.120]  And of course he did predict
[2:08:54.120 --> 2:08:55.120]  More than a decade ago
[2:08:55.120 --> 2:08:58.120]  The cooling trend and that's now begun
[2:08:58.120 --> 2:09:01.120]  But going back to Pierce Corbin
[2:09:01.120 --> 2:09:03.120]  Astrophysicist, meteorologist
[2:09:03.120 --> 2:09:05.120]  The list goes on and on
[2:09:05.120 --> 2:09:08.120]  Sir, the mindset of these people
[2:09:08.120 --> 2:09:09.120]  You've been persecuted by him
[2:09:09.120 --> 2:09:11.120]  Demonized anyone else that
[2:09:11.120 --> 2:09:13.120]  Dr. Tim Ball got death threats
[2:09:13.120 --> 2:09:15.120]  I could barely get him to be interviewed
[2:09:15.120 --> 2:09:17.120]  For my film, Follow the Republic
[2:09:17.120 --> 2:09:19.120]  People get persecuted
[2:09:19.120 --> 2:09:22.120]  People are, I mean
[2:09:22.120 --> 2:09:24.120]  These are very dangerous folks
[2:09:24.120 --> 2:09:26.120]  Why are they doing it?
[2:09:26.120 --> 2:09:28.120]  Well, they're motive
[2:09:28.120 --> 2:09:29.120]  If they're telling lies
[2:09:29.120 --> 2:09:30.120]  There must be a reason
[2:09:30.120 --> 2:09:33.120]  Because we know the climate thing is a fraud
[2:09:33.120 --> 2:09:35.120]  Well, what we think they want to do
[2:09:35.120 --> 2:09:36.120]  And it's pretty clear
[2:09:36.120 --> 2:09:38.120]  Is they want to create another bubble
[2:09:38.120 --> 2:09:41.120]  Of false value using carbon trading
[2:09:41.120 --> 2:09:42.120]  Which is now worth hundreds
[2:09:42.120 --> 2:09:44.120]  Of billions of pounds a year
[2:09:44.120 --> 2:09:46.120]  And through this
[2:09:46.120 --> 2:09:49.120]  They hope to control the world economy
[2:09:49.120 --> 2:09:52.120]  Hold back development of
[2:09:52.120 --> 2:09:54.120]  Underdeveloped countries
[2:09:54.120 --> 2:09:56.120]  And keep food prices high
[2:09:56.120 --> 2:09:59.120]  By burning food and biofuels
[2:09:59.120 --> 2:10:02.120]  Which is a death sentence
[2:10:02.120 --> 2:10:04.120]  Well, of course it is
[2:10:04.120 --> 2:10:06.120]  The result of their policies
[2:10:06.120 --> 2:10:09.120]  Is causing starvation and food rights
[2:10:09.120 --> 2:10:11.120]  In a number of countries
[2:10:11.120 --> 2:10:13.120]  And it's also causing
[2:10:13.120 --> 2:10:15.120]  They claim they're trying to build jobs
[2:10:15.120 --> 2:10:17.120]  In a low carbon economy
[2:10:17.120 --> 2:10:18.120]  But in Britain
[2:10:18.120 --> 2:10:20.120]  We've got an example where
[2:10:20.120 --> 2:10:22.120]  Steelworks in Northern England
[2:10:22.120 --> 2:10:23.120]  At a place called Red Car
[2:10:23.120 --> 2:10:25.120]  Is closing because
[2:10:25.120 --> 2:10:27.120]  Tata Steel, who own it
[2:10:27.120 --> 2:10:29.120]  Are getting a handout
[2:10:29.120 --> 2:10:31.120]  For reducing carbon emissions in England
[2:10:31.120 --> 2:10:33.120]  And at the same time
[2:10:33.120 --> 2:10:34.120]  They're getting another handout
[2:10:34.120 --> 2:10:37.120]  For building so-called clean steelworks
[2:10:37.120 --> 2:10:38.120]  In India
[2:10:38.120 --> 2:10:40.120]  So they're taking two billion quid
[2:10:40.120 --> 2:10:42.120]  Two billion dollars
[2:10:42.120 --> 2:10:44.120]  And making
[2:10:44.120 --> 2:10:46.120]  1,700 workers in Britain
[2:10:46.120 --> 2:10:47.120]  Redundant
[2:10:47.120 --> 2:10:49.120]  And lo and behold
[2:10:49.120 --> 2:10:51.120]  The interesting to notice
[2:10:51.120 --> 2:10:53.120]  That the director of the
[2:10:53.120 --> 2:10:55.120]  Tata Steel Energy Research Institute
[2:10:55.120 --> 2:10:57.120]  Is Dr. Patcherite
[2:10:57.120 --> 2:11:00.120]  Who is also chair of the United Nations
[2:11:00.120 --> 2:11:01.120]  IPCC
[2:11:01.120 --> 2:11:04.120]  i.e. their panel on climate change
[2:11:04.120 --> 2:11:05.120]  Which is promoting
[2:11:05.120 --> 2:11:06.120]  Open credit schemes
[2:11:06.120 --> 2:11:08.120]  And for those that don't recognize the name
[2:11:08.120 --> 2:11:10.120]  He's the guy that looks like a sum of bin Laden
[2:11:10.120 --> 2:11:14.120]  Yes, that's the one
[2:11:14.120 --> 2:11:16.120]  So expanding on this
[2:11:16.120 --> 2:11:18.120]  To put this in layman's terms
[2:11:18.120 --> 2:11:20.120]  A group of crooks are in there
[2:11:20.120 --> 2:11:22.120]  Using taxpayer money
[2:11:22.120 --> 2:11:24.120]  To move what's left
[2:11:24.120 --> 2:11:26.120]  Of western industry
[2:11:26.120 --> 2:11:28.120]  To third world areas
[2:11:28.120 --> 2:11:30.120]  Where they control the population
[2:11:30.120 --> 2:11:31.120]  And have slave wages
[2:11:31.120 --> 2:11:33.120]  It's all coal-blooded
[2:11:33.120 --> 2:11:35.120]  It's like Al Gore's
[2:11:35.120 --> 2:11:37.120]  Occidental petroleum that he controls
[2:11:37.120 --> 2:11:39.120]  Being one of the worst violators
[2:11:39.120 --> 2:11:40.120]  Of the rainforest
[2:11:40.120 --> 2:11:42.120]  And things that actually
[2:11:42.120 --> 2:11:43.120]  Can be registered
[2:11:43.120 --> 2:11:45.120]  As some type of environmental loss
[2:11:45.120 --> 2:11:47.120]  Even though it can be regenerated
[2:11:47.120 --> 2:11:49.120]  The point is that I've always noticed
[2:11:49.120 --> 2:11:50.120]  Like Maury Strong
[2:11:50.120 --> 2:11:52.120]  They are the biggest polluters
[2:11:52.120 --> 2:11:55.120]  It's just utterly sick
[2:11:55.120 --> 2:11:57.120]  How they get away with this
[2:11:57.120 --> 2:11:59.120]  And here's another example
[2:11:59.120 --> 2:12:01.120]  Of the 50 billion given to General Motors
[2:12:01.120 --> 2:12:03.120]  11 million was spent
[2:12:03.120 --> 2:12:05.120]  To create green factories
[2:12:05.120 --> 2:12:07.120]  For quote
[2:12:07.120 --> 2:12:09.120]  These better cars
[2:12:09.120 --> 2:12:11.120]  In Eastern Europe
[2:12:11.120 --> 2:12:13.120]  In China and Brazil
[2:12:13.120 --> 2:12:15.120]  US taxpayers paid
[2:12:15.120 --> 2:12:17.120]  To have our factory shut down
[2:12:17.120 --> 2:12:19.120]  And moved overseas
[2:12:19.120 --> 2:12:21.120]  Yeah, it's monstrous
[2:12:21.120 --> 2:12:23.120]  And of course the consequence
[2:12:23.120 --> 2:12:25.120]  In America and Britain
[2:12:25.120 --> 2:12:27.120]  Is that wages are going to be forced down
[2:12:27.120 --> 2:12:29.120]  And living standards are forced down
[2:12:29.120 --> 2:12:31.120]  And the people that are running this whole show
[2:12:31.120 --> 2:12:33.120]  Tata Steel and their sidekicks
[2:12:33.120 --> 2:12:35.120]  Get rich
[2:12:35.120 --> 2:12:37.120]  And so, well, everywhere
[2:12:37.120 --> 2:12:39.120]  The fraud is so incredible
[2:12:39.120 --> 2:12:41.120]  I mean, what we just stated
[2:12:41.120 --> 2:12:43.120]  Is the cold hard facts
[2:12:43.120 --> 2:12:45.120]  And my mind can't believe it
[2:12:45.120 --> 2:12:47.120]  Because it's just such
[2:12:47.120 --> 2:12:49.120]  We're paying taxes
[2:12:49.120 --> 2:12:51.120]  To have our factory shut
[2:12:51.120 --> 2:12:53.120]  Yeah, that's exactly right
[2:12:53.120 --> 2:12:55.120]  It's mad, it's complete madness
[2:12:55.120 --> 2:12:57.120]  And you see, some of the politicians
[2:12:57.120 --> 2:12:59.120]  Probably believe they're saving the planet
[2:12:59.120 --> 2:13:01.120]  But I hope that with
[2:13:01.120 --> 2:13:03.120]  Climategate they will realize
[2:13:03.120 --> 2:13:05.120]  That it's a fraud
[2:13:05.120 --> 2:13:07.120]  Just like when Tony Blair had
[2:13:07.120 --> 2:13:09.120]  His war in Iraq
[2:13:09.120 --> 2:13:11.120]  Along with Bush, I mean
[2:13:11.120 --> 2:13:13.120]  They made up stories to justify it
[2:13:13.120 --> 2:13:15.120]  And they believed that any story was good
[2:13:15.120 --> 2:13:17.120]  Because they were doing his right
[2:13:17.120 --> 2:13:19.120]  Now, some of them believe that
[2:13:19.120 --> 2:13:21.120]  For this, but in the case of Britain
[2:13:21.120 --> 2:13:23.120]  A lot of politicians now realize
[2:13:23.120 --> 2:13:25.120]  They were tricks and they don't like it
[2:13:25.120 --> 2:13:27.120]  And it may happen this time
[2:13:27.120 --> 2:13:29.120]  That a lot of politicians realize
[2:13:29.120 --> 2:13:31.120]  Now that this is a fraud
[2:13:31.120 --> 2:13:33.120]  I think in the coming gear
[2:13:33.120 --> 2:13:35.120]  But it won't happen by itself
[2:13:35.120 --> 2:13:37.120]  We have to fight for it
[2:13:37.120 --> 2:13:39.120]  Well, I agree with you, this is devastating to them
[2:13:39.120 --> 2:13:41.120]  Because now all the previous hockey stick
[2:13:41.120 --> 2:13:43.120]  Frauds from Man and
[2:13:43.120 --> 2:13:45.120]  And Santor's fraud
[2:13:45.120 --> 2:13:47.120]  Just removing from the UN's own report
[2:13:47.120 --> 2:13:49.120]  That Man wasn't
[2:13:49.120 --> 2:13:51.120]  I mean, we knew about that at the time
[2:13:51.120 --> 2:13:53.120]  But I was kind of gobsmacked
[2:13:53.120 --> 2:13:55.120]  And however when we talked about it
[2:13:55.120 --> 2:13:57.120]  No one believed us, you know
[2:13:57.120 --> 2:13:59.120]  But now, because of some people
[2:13:59.120 --> 2:14:01.120]  Who have been working hard on it, it's come out
[2:14:01.120 --> 2:14:03.120]  That's a good term, God's smacked
[2:14:03.120 --> 2:14:05.120]  No, I mean, that's how I feel every day
[2:14:05.120 --> 2:14:07.120]  It's that they're just open criminals
[2:14:07.120 --> 2:14:09.120]  Running around stealing
[2:14:09.120 --> 2:14:11.120]  Engaged in every form of mischief
[2:14:11.120 --> 2:14:13.120]  And instead of them all being arrested
[2:14:13.120 --> 2:14:15.120]  They're running the planet
[2:14:15.120 --> 2:14:17.120]  Well, that's right
[2:14:17.120 --> 2:14:19.120]  But we're saying very clearly
[2:14:19.120 --> 2:14:21.120]  The scientists involved in this fraud
[2:14:21.120 --> 2:14:23.120]  Should be sacked from their jobs
[2:14:23.120 --> 2:14:25.120]  And arrested too, where there's clearly
[2:14:25.120 --> 2:14:27.120]  You can prove which individuals have done what
[2:14:27.120 --> 2:14:29.120]  100s of millions of dollars of taxpayer research funds
[2:14:29.120 --> 2:14:31.120]  Correct, correct
[2:14:31.120 --> 2:14:33.120]  For quackery, speaking of funds
[2:14:33.120 --> 2:14:35.120]  You're not funded by big corporations
[2:14:35.120 --> 2:14:37.120]  We are not, we receive nothing
[2:14:37.120 --> 2:14:39.120]  From governments and you can understand
[2:14:39.120 --> 2:14:41.120]  Why
[2:14:41.120 --> 2:14:43.120]  We do receive money from farmers
[2:14:43.120 --> 2:14:45.120]  And generally small businesses
[2:14:45.120 --> 2:14:47.120]  And sometimes
[2:14:47.120 --> 2:14:49.120]  Larger businesses, but
[2:14:49.120 --> 2:14:51.120]  There's a recession, so we don't get much
[2:14:51.120 --> 2:14:53.120]  We're extremely
[2:14:53.120 --> 2:14:55.120]  Short of money
[2:14:55.120 --> 2:14:57.120]  We have a small workforce that works
[2:14:57.120 --> 2:14:59.120]  Very hard for what we do
[2:14:59.120 --> 2:15:01.120]  And farmers appreciate us
[2:15:01.120 --> 2:15:03.120]  But farmers aren't well off
[2:15:03.120 --> 2:15:05.120]  Anyone who wants to buy anything from us

[2:15:13.120 --> 2:15:15.120]  And Canada till December
[2:15:15.120 --> 2:15:17.120]  Which we're giving you free
[2:15:17.120 --> 2:15:19.120]  Although normally we do charge for it
[2:15:19.120 --> 2:15:21.120]  But it's important stuff happening
[2:15:21.120 --> 2:15:23.120]  Absolutely, people can go and get great
[2:15:23.120 --> 2:15:25.120]  What have been proven to be very accurate
[2:15:25.120 --> 2:15:27.120]  Nothing's perfect, but compared to others
[2:15:27.120 --> 2:15:29.120]  Very accurate
[2:15:29.120 --> 2:15:31.120]  There on the website weatheraction.com
[2:15:31.120 --> 2:15:33.120]  One word, weatheraction.com
[2:15:33.120 --> 2:15:35.120]  Okay, in the last five minutes we've got
[2:15:35.120 --> 2:15:37.120]  Sir, give us your forecast
[2:15:37.120 --> 2:15:39.120]  Yes, important things happening
[2:15:39.120 --> 2:15:41.120]  In the last parts
[2:15:41.120 --> 2:15:43.120]  The closing in the last third of
[2:15:43.120 --> 2:15:45.120]  December
[2:15:45.120 --> 2:15:47.120]  Basically between the 19th and 31st
[2:15:47.120 --> 2:15:49.120]  There's going to be a series
[2:15:49.120 --> 2:15:51.120]  Of waves of severe
[2:15:51.120 --> 2:15:53.120]  And at times dangerous
[2:15:53.120 --> 2:15:55.120]  And wintry weather
[2:15:55.120 --> 2:15:57.120]  Both in the USA and Canada
[2:15:57.120 --> 2:15:59.120]  And the main periods
[2:15:59.120 --> 2:16:01.120]  Are going to be the 19th to 20th
[2:16:01.120 --> 2:16:03.120]  And there's a lot of them
[2:16:03.120 --> 2:16:05.120]  22nd to 23rd
[2:16:05.120 --> 2:16:07.120]  25th to 27th over Christmas
[2:16:07.120 --> 2:16:09.120]  So keep you indoors
[2:16:09.120 --> 2:16:11.120]  And the 28th to the 30th
[2:16:11.120 --> 2:16:13.120]  Now that is especially
[2:16:13.120 --> 2:16:15.120]  Extreme
[2:16:15.120 --> 2:16:17.120]  And could involve storms
[2:16:17.120 --> 2:16:19.120]  As extreme as the things that happen
[2:16:19.120 --> 2:16:21.120]  On the 17th to 19th
[2:16:21.120 --> 2:16:23.120]  Of November around the world
[2:16:23.120 --> 2:16:25.120]  That will be a simultaneous event
[2:16:25.120 --> 2:16:27.120]  Around the world, but certainly
[2:16:27.120 --> 2:16:29.120]  Major cold blasts and snowstorms
[2:16:29.120 --> 2:16:31.120]  In the USA
[2:16:31.120 --> 2:16:33.120]  Probably
[2:16:33.120 --> 2:16:35.120]  Certainly including the Midwest
[2:16:35.120 --> 2:16:37.120]  Now, we normally
[2:16:37.120 --> 2:16:39.120]  Have a bit more detail than this
[2:16:39.120 --> 2:16:41.120]  And we will put out for that period
[2:16:41.120 --> 2:16:43.120]  Some more details
[2:16:43.120 --> 2:16:45.120]  As far as we can ascertain it
[2:16:45.120 --> 2:16:47.120]  And in the past
[2:16:47.120 --> 2:16:49.120]  We have put out quite a lot of detail
[2:16:49.120 --> 2:16:51.120]  We'll get a bit more for this
[2:16:51.120 --> 2:16:53.120]  The end part of the month
[2:16:53.120 --> 2:16:55.120]  Will be accompanied
[2:16:55.120 --> 2:16:57.120]  By simultaneous events
[2:16:57.120 --> 2:16:59.120]  Around the world
[2:16:59.120 --> 2:17:01.120]  And moving into January
[2:17:01.120 --> 2:17:03.120]  January the 5th to the 8th
[2:17:03.120 --> 2:17:05.120]  We'll also see
[2:17:05.120 --> 2:17:07.120]  Some quite a lot of extreme events
[2:17:07.120 --> 2:17:09.120]  And again we'll clarify the details
[2:17:09.120 --> 2:17:11.120]  Of that on the website
[2:17:11.120 --> 2:17:13.120]  What about El Nino
[2:17:13.120 --> 2:17:15.120]  And precipitation
[2:17:15.120 --> 2:17:17.120]  We've had less precipitation
[2:17:17.120 --> 2:17:19.120]  Than we normally did the last three years
[2:17:19.120 --> 2:17:21.120]  On average in the US
[2:17:21.120 --> 2:17:23.120]  A lot of forecast we're seeing
[2:17:23.120 --> 2:17:25.120]  Say more precipitation
[2:17:25.120 --> 2:17:27.120]  Is that lining up with your research?
[2:17:27.120 --> 2:17:29.120]  Yes, we've got to do a lot more work
[2:17:29.120 --> 2:17:31.120]  On American forecast
[2:17:31.120 --> 2:17:33.120]  Because our most skill is Britain
[2:17:33.120 --> 2:17:35.120]  Ireland and Europe
[2:17:35.120 --> 2:17:37.120]  And there's going to be
[2:17:37.120 --> 2:17:39.120]  Simultaneous events
[2:17:39.120 --> 2:17:41.120]  You can get them free if you look
[2:17:41.120 --> 2:17:43.120]  In Europe too as they're happening in America
[2:17:45.120 --> 2:17:47.120]  The main
[2:17:47.120 --> 2:17:49.120]  Driver or the pattern
[2:17:49.120 --> 2:17:51.120]  The most significant pattern in America
[2:17:51.120 --> 2:17:53.120]  Is a kind of 60 year cycle
[2:17:53.120 --> 2:17:55.120]  Which is about the
[2:17:55.120 --> 2:17:57.120]  What's called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation
[2:17:57.120 --> 2:17:59.120]  It's about the flow and temperature
[2:17:59.120 --> 2:18:01.120]  The last drought was in the early 50s
[2:18:01.120 --> 2:18:03.120]  And the really bad one
[2:18:03.120 --> 2:18:05.120]  And now we've had another drought
[2:18:05.120 --> 2:18:07.120]  60 years later
[2:18:07.120 --> 2:18:09.120]  60 years later
[2:18:09.120 --> 2:18:11.120]  These are driven
[2:18:11.120 --> 2:18:13.120]  What happens in the Pacific
[2:18:13.120 --> 2:18:15.120]  Is part of the climate system
[2:18:15.120 --> 2:18:17.120]  Which gives these things
[2:18:17.120 --> 2:18:19.120]  And that climate system
[2:18:19.120 --> 2:18:21.120]  Can be understood in terms of the
[2:18:21.120 --> 2:18:23.120]  Lunar modulation
[2:18:23.120 --> 2:18:25.120]  Of the magnetic cycle
[2:18:25.120 --> 2:18:27.120]  Of the sun
[2:18:27.120 --> 2:18:29.120]  And this is explained on our website
[2:18:29.120 --> 2:18:31.120]  In various documents
[2:18:31.120 --> 2:18:33.120]  For those that don't know
[2:18:33.120 --> 2:18:35.120]  The moon drives the ocean
[2:18:35.120 --> 2:18:37.120]  It blocks out solar radiation
[2:18:37.120 --> 2:18:39.120]  That's right
[2:18:39.120 --> 2:18:41.120]  It interferes with the solar wind
[2:18:41.120 --> 2:18:43.120]  So the plane of the moon's orbit
[2:18:43.120 --> 2:18:45.120]  Has a period of about
[2:18:45.120 --> 2:18:47.120]  It rotates around the sun every 18
[2:18:47.120 --> 2:18:49.120]  But according to the UN
[2:18:49.120 --> 2:18:51.120]  The sun, the moon, nothing
[2:18:51.120 --> 2:18:53.120]  Well they would say that wouldn't they
[2:18:53.120 --> 2:18:55.120]  I mean you know
[2:18:55.120 --> 2:18:57.120]  They have a mission to
[2:18:57.120 --> 2:18:59.120]  Con us
[2:18:59.120 --> 2:19:01.120]  But the cons are so big
[2:19:01.120 --> 2:19:03.120]  To say polar bears can't swim
[2:19:03.120 --> 2:19:05.120]  Their numbers are down
[2:19:05.120 --> 2:19:07.120]  Polar bears do it very well actually
[2:19:07.120 --> 2:19:09.120]  Polar bears do it extremely well
[2:19:09.120 --> 2:19:11.120]  Polar bears did it very well
[2:19:11.120 --> 2:19:13.120]  During you know
[2:19:13.120 --> 2:19:15.120]  Between 10,000 years ago
[2:19:15.120 --> 2:19:17.120]  And 1,000 years ago when the world was warmer
[2:19:17.120 --> 2:19:19.120]  The Eskimos and so on
[2:19:19.120 --> 2:19:21.120]  Were perfectly happy then
[2:19:21.120 --> 2:19:23.120]  So for them to say their feeling friend
[2:19:23.120 --> 2:19:25.120]  Is complete nonsense
[2:19:25.120 --> 2:19:27.120]  It's utter rubbish
[2:19:27.120 --> 2:19:29.120]  It's utter rubbish to say
[2:19:29.120 --> 2:19:31.120]  That the sun doesn't affect climate
[2:19:31.120 --> 2:19:33.120]  They actually say that
[2:19:33.120 --> 2:19:35.120]  And that's a really amazing interview

[2:21:02.120 --> 2:21:04.120]  December 18th 2009
[2:21:04.120 --> 2:21:06.120]  Gold opened this morning at 110490
[2:21:06.120 --> 2:21:08.120]  A one ounce gold coin to be purchased for
[2:21:08.120 --> 2:21:10.120]  113516
[2:21:10.120 --> 2:21:12.120]  56758 for a half ounce

[2:21:18.120 --> 2:21:20.120]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton
[2:21:20.120 --> 2:21:22.120]  Weave it into fabric, engrave the ink
[2:21:22.120 --> 2:21:24.120]  Protect it from counterfeit
[2:21:24.120 --> 2:21:26.120]  Then cart the money off to a privately owned bank
[2:21:26.120 --> 2:21:28.120]  To have it lent back to us at interest
[2:21:28.120 --> 2:21:30.120]  Forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt
[2:21:30.120 --> 2:21:32.120]  Is this capitalism or was Jefferson correct
[2:21:32.120 --> 2:21:34.120]  When he said a central bank issuing
[2:21:34.120 --> 2:21:36.120]  A public currency is a greater menace
[2:21:36.120 --> 2:21:38.120]  To the liberties of the people in a standing army
[2:21:38.120 --> 2:21:40.120]  Hi, Ted Anderson
[2:21:40.120 --> 2:21:42.120]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book
[2:21:42.120 --> 2:21:44.120]  That explains how the monetary system works
[2:21:44.120 --> 2:21:46.120]  Call for your copy
[2:21:46.120 --> 2:21:48.120]  1-800-686-2237
[2:21:48.120 --> 2:21:50.120]  Isn't it time to understand the system
[2:21:50.120 --> 2:21:52.120]  Call 800-686-2237
[2:21:52.120 --> 2:21:55.120]  That's 800-686-2237
[2:21:58.120 --> 2:22:00.120]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny
[2:22:00.120 --> 2:22:02.120]  In the last century alone
[2:22:02.120 --> 2:22:05.120]  This is our last chance to not relive history
[2:22:05.120 --> 2:22:07.120]  Is it finishing off this agenda
[2:22:07.120 --> 2:22:09.120]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath
[2:22:09.120 --> 2:22:10.120]  Americans at home
[2:22:10.120 --> 2:22:12.120]  I have a tremendous influence
[2:22:12.120 --> 2:22:14.120]  On our president in Congress
[2:22:14.120 --> 2:22:16.120]  And they really are calling the shots
[2:22:16.120 --> 2:22:19.120]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[2:22:19.120 --> 2:22:21.120]  As American citizens to pay attention
[2:22:21.120 --> 2:22:23.120]  Fall of the Republic identifies
[2:22:23.120 --> 2:22:25.120]  The enemies of our nation
[2:22:25.120 --> 2:22:27.120]  The criminal off-short cartel
[2:22:27.120 --> 2:22:29.120]  Held bent on destroying sovereignty
[2:22:29.120 --> 2:22:31.120]  And on its ashes constructing world government
[2:22:31.120 --> 2:22:33.120]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists
[2:22:33.120 --> 2:22:35.120]  They're asking for more matches
[2:22:35.120 --> 2:22:37.120]  And the Congress is saying
[2:22:37.120 --> 2:22:38.120]  Who do we make the checkout to?
[2:22:38.120 --> 2:22:40.120]  Today seems like nobody does care
[2:22:40.120 --> 2:22:42.120]  And right now in Washington DC
[2:22:42.120 --> 2:22:45.120]  We have seen a fall of the Republic

[2:24:23.120 --> 2:24:26.120]  That they're telling school children
[2:24:26.120 --> 2:24:28.120]  In government produced documentaries
[2:24:28.120 --> 2:24:29.120]  That penguins are drowning
[2:24:29.120 --> 2:24:31.120]  And that polar bears are drowning
[2:24:31.120 --> 2:24:33.120]  They actually say it
[2:24:33.120 --> 2:24:34.120]  For years
[2:24:34.120 --> 2:24:36.120]  I saw it again two, three weeks ago
[2:24:36.120 --> 2:24:38.120]  On KXAN locally in Austin
[2:24:38.120 --> 2:24:41.120]  I've seen speeches at the Copenhagen event
[2:24:41.120 --> 2:24:42.120]  In the last week
[2:24:42.120 --> 2:24:43.120]  And I'm hardly even watching it
[2:24:43.120 --> 2:24:44.120]  Where they're saying the polar bears
[2:24:44.120 --> 2:24:45.120]  Will all disappear
[2:24:45.120 --> 2:24:48.120]  They've got John, John, John, John
[2:24:48.120 --> 2:24:49.120]  Here
[2:24:49.120 --> 2:24:51.120]  They've got giant billboards up saying
[2:24:51.120 --> 2:24:53.120]  Don't let the polar bears die
[2:24:53.120 --> 2:24:55.120]  And giant billboards of a little girl
[2:24:55.120 --> 2:24:57.120]  Saying please don't let me drown
[2:24:57.120 --> 2:24:59.120]  They're telling kids the ocean
[2:24:59.120 --> 2:25:01.120]  Like the day after tomorrow
[2:25:01.120 --> 2:25:02.120]  Funded by globalist
[2:25:02.120 --> 2:25:04.120]  Is going to come crashing over
[2:25:04.120 --> 2:25:06.120]  With 500-foot waves
[2:25:06.120 --> 2:25:10.120]  Knocking over the Empire State's building
[2:25:10.120 --> 2:25:13.120]  I mean, it's as ridiculous as saying
[2:25:13.120 --> 2:25:16.120]  Giant flying saucers are going to land
[2:25:16.120 --> 2:25:18.120]  And thousands of Marvin the Martians
[2:25:18.120 --> 2:25:20.120]  Are going to march off with ray guns
[2:25:20.120 --> 2:25:23.120]  If we don't pay Al Gore money
[2:25:23.120 --> 2:25:26.120]  The UN on Monday came out
[2:25:26.120 --> 2:25:28.120]  And again countered and said
[2:25:28.120 --> 2:25:32.120]  The sun does not affect climate
[2:25:32.120 --> 2:25:34.120]  And then millions of zombies went
[2:25:34.120 --> 2:25:36.120]  The sun does not affect climate
[2:25:36.120 --> 2:25:38.120]  The sun does not affect climate
[2:25:38.120 --> 2:25:42.120]  Jumping off cliffs does not break your legs
[2:25:42.120 --> 2:25:45.120]  Jumping in front of 18 wheelers
[2:25:45.120 --> 2:25:48.120]  Coming 100 miles an hour will not hurt you
[2:25:48.120 --> 2:25:51.120]  I love Al Gore, I love being an idiot
[2:25:51.120 --> 2:25:53.120]  I love being a zombie
[2:25:53.120 --> 2:25:55.120]  I mean, it's just, it's ridiculous
[2:25:55.120 --> 2:25:57.120]  And now of course it's come out
[2:25:57.120 --> 2:25:59.120]  Not just the White House memo
[2:25:59.120 --> 2:26:01.120]  Not just the Downing Street memo
[2:26:01.120 --> 2:26:03.120]  But yes, it's come out in the last two weeks
[2:26:03.120 --> 2:26:06.120]  That Tony Blair, this is BBC reporting
[2:26:06.120 --> 2:26:10.120]  Confirms that Tony Blair knew there were no WMDs
[2:26:10.120 --> 2:26:13.120]  Of course they knew there were no WMDs
[2:26:13.120 --> 2:26:15.120]  Of course they consciously knew
[2:26:15.120 --> 2:26:18.120]  And lied and went to war
[2:26:18.120 --> 2:26:20.120]  Not, oh, they thought they were there
[2:26:20.120 --> 2:26:23.120]  And they were wrong, they knew
[2:26:23.120 --> 2:26:25.120]  They lied
[2:26:25.120 --> 2:26:27.120]  For five years we've had the minutes
[2:26:27.120 --> 2:26:29.120]  Of the meetings between Blair and Bush
[2:26:29.120 --> 2:26:31.120]  Where Bush said we're going to do this
[2:26:31.120 --> 2:26:32.120]  And we've got to make it up
[2:26:32.120 --> 2:26:34.120]  And they said, okay, how do we shoot down
[2:26:34.120 --> 2:26:36.120]  U.S. planes and blame it on Saddam?
[2:26:36.120 --> 2:26:38.120]  How do we stage a terror attack?
[2:26:38.120 --> 2:26:40.120]  This is all mainstream news
[2:26:40.120 --> 2:26:43.120]  How do we stage terror attacks?
[2:26:43.120 --> 2:26:45.120]  You know, they tried that deal
[2:26:45.120 --> 2:26:47.120]  Where they put out the radio transmission
[2:26:47.120 --> 2:26:49.120]  That we're going to blow up your ship
[2:26:49.120 --> 2:26:52.120]  We're going to blow up your ship in the Strait of Hormuz
[2:26:52.120 --> 2:26:56.120]  When an Iranian patrol boat was a mile and a half away
[2:26:56.120 --> 2:26:58.120]  Trying to get the people on the ship
[2:26:58.120 --> 2:26:59.120]  To open fire on the patrol boat
[2:26:59.120 --> 2:27:01.120]  And they did it over and over and over again
[2:27:01.120 --> 2:27:03.120]  With Navy SEALs out there
[2:27:03.120 --> 2:27:05.120]  They didn't just plan it, they did it
[2:27:05.120 --> 2:27:08.120]  Running around, broadcasting, we're going to blow you up
[2:27:08.120 --> 2:27:11.120]  And I guess the SEALs thought they were just so macho
[2:27:11.120 --> 2:27:13.120]  They were going to take fire on their boat
[2:27:13.120 --> 2:27:15.120]  I mean, how do they get these guys
[2:27:15.120 --> 2:27:18.120]  To engage in this type of treason?
[2:27:18.120 --> 2:27:20.120]  Well, that's what tough guys do
[2:27:20.120 --> 2:27:22.120]  Alex, you're just not tough
[2:27:22.120 --> 2:27:24.120]  You don't know how to stage terror attacks
[2:27:24.120 --> 2:27:26.120]  Because even if, you know,
[2:27:26.120 --> 2:27:28.120]  Blowing up the World Trade Centers
[2:27:28.120 --> 2:27:30.120]  Was killed 3,000
[2:27:30.120 --> 2:27:32.120]  If we don't fight the Arabs
[2:27:32.120 --> 2:27:35.120]  They're going to take over the world
[2:27:35.120 --> 2:27:37.120]  In America's weak
[2:27:37.120 --> 2:27:39.120]  To be taught and had to be shown a lesson
[2:27:39.120 --> 2:27:41.120]  So they'd get behind defending our sovereignty
[2:27:41.120 --> 2:27:44.120]  And stopping the Muslims
[2:27:44.120 --> 2:27:46.120]  And then in every case, the radical Muslims
[2:27:46.120 --> 2:27:48.120]  Are funded by our government on record
[2:27:48.120 --> 2:27:50.120]  And used to overthrow
[2:27:50.120 --> 2:27:53.120]  Mainline and moderate and secular governments
[2:27:53.120 --> 2:27:56.120]  In the Middle East and Central Asia
[2:27:56.120 --> 2:27:58.120]  Yes, I know there are wild-eyed Muslims
[2:27:58.120 --> 2:28:00.120]  That want to chop your head off
[2:28:00.120 --> 2:28:02.120]  And drown their daughters
[2:28:02.120 --> 2:28:04.120]  Because our stinking government
[2:28:04.120 --> 2:28:06.120]  And the British government put them in power
[2:28:06.120 --> 2:28:08.120]  Our criminal government likes to deal with
[2:28:08.120 --> 2:28:10.120]  Dictatorships
[2:28:13.120 --> 2:28:16.120]  They like to deal with thugs
[2:28:17.120 --> 2:28:21.120]  Yes, I get the whole Islamic fascism thing
[2:28:21.120 --> 2:28:25.120]  Made in America, made in England, made in Israel
[2:28:26.120 --> 2:28:28.120]  Did those people exist before
[2:28:28.120 --> 2:28:30.120]  Without the globalist helping them?
[2:28:30.120 --> 2:28:33.120]  Yes, yes
[2:28:33.120 --> 2:28:35.120]  Kind of like a acorn existed
[2:28:35.120 --> 2:28:38.120]  Before it was buried by a squirrel
[2:28:40.120 --> 2:28:43.120]  And then watered and loved and taken care of
[2:28:44.120 --> 2:28:47.120]  And then now is used to menace the West
[2:28:47.120 --> 2:28:49.120]  To give up all of our rights
[2:28:49.120 --> 2:28:51.120]  In the name of fighting the dangerous
[2:28:51.120 --> 2:28:54.120]  Brown-skinned men that wear turbans
[2:28:54.120 --> 2:28:57.120]  That look funny
[2:28:58.120 --> 2:29:00.120]  But then you find out it's all
[2:29:00.120 --> 2:29:03.120]  A Hollywood production
[2:29:03.120 --> 2:29:06.120]  And you get the Homeland Security documents
[2:29:06.120 --> 2:29:08.120]  That we got and we broke
[2:29:09.120 --> 2:29:11.120]  And it said
[2:29:11.120 --> 2:29:12.120]  First people couldn't believe it
[2:29:12.120 --> 2:29:14.120]  Then it came out it wasn't real
[2:29:14.120 --> 2:29:15.120]  And people said, I guess it's all right
[2:29:15.120 --> 2:29:17.120]  If veterans are the number one threat
[2:29:17.120 --> 2:29:19.120]  And Homeland Security's really set up
[2:29:19.120 --> 2:29:21.120]  For American gun owners
[2:29:22.120 --> 2:29:25.120]  That is a treasonous, larsenous, treacherous,
[2:29:25.120 --> 2:29:28.120]  Criminal, illegitimate government
[2:29:28.120 --> 2:29:30.120]  It's a corporate group of crooks
[2:29:30.120 --> 2:29:32.120]  That have hijacked the nation
[2:29:32.120 --> 2:29:34.120]  Now, I know you know that
[2:29:34.120 --> 2:29:36.120]  But we better get that message out
[2:29:36.120 --> 2:29:38.120]  To everybody we know
[2:29:38.120 --> 2:29:40.120]  Or these people are going to succeed
[2:29:40.120 --> 2:29:42.120]  In starting World War III
[2:29:42.120 --> 2:29:44.120]  With the American people
[2:29:47.120 --> 2:29:48.120]  We're on the march
[2:29:48.120 --> 2:29:50.120]  The Empire's on the run
[2:29:50.120 --> 2:29:53.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[2:29:56.120 --> 2:29:58.120]  Hello, this is Alex Jones
[2:29:58.120 --> 2:30:00.120]  With some important questions
[2:30:00.120 --> 2:30:02.120]  If you're going into a battle
[2:30:02.120 --> 2:30:04.120]  And they give you a rifle and a sidearm
[2:30:04.120 --> 2:30:06.120]  How much ammunition do you want?
[2:30:06.120 --> 2:30:08.120]  My answer would be all I can get
[2:30:08.120 --> 2:30:10.120]  In the battle for freedom
[2:30:10.120 --> 2:30:12.120]  And the lives of your loved ones
[2:30:12.120 --> 2:30:14.120]  Food is your only ammunition
[2:30:14.120 --> 2:30:16.120]  How much do you want? When do you want it?
[2:30:16.120 --> 2:30:18.120]  Now or after the battle starts
[2:30:18.120 --> 2:30:20.120]  When will you need it?
[2:30:20.120 --> 2:30:22.120]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[2:30:22.120 --> 2:30:24.120]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[2:30:24.120 --> 2:30:26.120]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself
[2:30:26.120 --> 2:30:28.120]  Will you go to the gathering center
[2:30:28.120 --> 2:30:30.120]  And you wipe out all these problems
[2:30:30.120 --> 2:30:32.120]  If you have a good food supply
[2:30:32.120 --> 2:30:34.120]  Food is your ammunition to fight
[2:30:34.120 --> 2:30:36.120]  For your freedom and your life
[2:30:36.120 --> 2:30:38.120]  How much will you need? We don't know
[2:30:38.120 --> 2:30:40.120]  How much do you want? All you can get
[2:30:40.120 --> 2:30:42.120]  I'm Alex Jones, I want all of you good guys

[2:33:26.120 --> 2:33:28.120]  Every time I'm watching a national security hearing
[2:33:28.120 --> 2:33:30.120]  In the House or Senate
[2:33:30.120 --> 2:33:32.120]  I see Wayne Madson back there taking notes
[2:33:32.120 --> 2:33:34.120]  And I wanted to get him on to get his take on Copenhagen
[2:33:34.120 --> 2:33:36.120]  Had no idea what his take would be
[2:33:36.120 --> 2:33:38.120]  Of course it's my take exactly
[2:33:38.120 --> 2:33:40.120]  Because it's just the truth
[2:33:40.120 --> 2:33:42.120]  That it's a total banker takeover
[2:33:42.120 --> 2:33:44.120]  But we'll get his take on that
[2:33:44.120 --> 2:33:46.120]  The climate gate coming out
[2:33:46.120 --> 2:33:48.120]  And people on the right saying they don't want new taxes
[2:33:48.120 --> 2:33:50.120]  The left is finding out
[2:33:50.120 --> 2:33:52.120]  It's an IMF World Bank takeover
[2:33:52.120 --> 2:33:54.120]  So we'll talk about that
[2:33:54.120 --> 2:33:56.120]  Then we'll get his take on healthcare
[2:33:56.120 --> 2:33:58.120]  It's not just in trouble
[2:33:58.120 --> 2:34:00.120]  With conservatives
[2:34:00.120 --> 2:34:02.120]  Now the left
[2:34:02.120 --> 2:34:04.120]  The head of the Democratic Party's against it
[2:34:04.120 --> 2:34:06.120]  Dean Kosenich, they say this isn't just a bailout
[2:34:06.120 --> 2:34:08.120]  It's a robbery
[2:34:08.120 --> 2:34:10.120]  Well I told you that months ago
[2:34:10.120 --> 2:34:12.120]  It was written by the insurance companies
[2:34:12.120 --> 2:34:14.120]  On that so
[2:34:14.120 --> 2:34:16.120]  The more we learn about the Copenhagen agreement
[2:34:16.120 --> 2:34:18.120]  The more we learn about the healthcare agreement
[2:34:18.120 --> 2:34:20.120]  We find out why they want to keep them secret
[2:34:20.120 --> 2:34:22.120]  Because the minute you see them
[2:34:22.120 --> 2:34:24.120]  You find out it's just like the banker bailout
[2:34:24.120 --> 2:34:26.120]  I call it the rape out
[2:34:26.120 --> 2:34:28.120]  It wasn't a bailout they just robbed us
[2:34:28.120 --> 2:34:30.120]  And so anything that happens Republican or Democrat
[2:34:30.120 --> 2:34:32.120]  Will be a robbery
[2:34:32.120 --> 2:34:34.120]  Wayne Madson good to have you on with us
[2:34:38.120 --> 2:34:40.120]  We didn't have you punched up sorry Wayne
[2:34:40.120 --> 2:34:42.120]  Wayne go ahead good to have you with us
[2:34:42.120 --> 2:34:44.120]  Hi Alex good to be with you
[2:34:44.120 --> 2:34:46.120]  Good to have you here okay break down Copenhagen
[2:34:46.120 --> 2:34:48.120]  Break down your take on healthcare
[2:34:48.120 --> 2:34:50.120]  And then I want to get your take on Russia
[2:34:50.120 --> 2:34:52.120]  Saying they may engage in preemptive war
[2:34:52.120 --> 2:34:54.120]  Now because of NATO and US policy
[2:34:54.120 --> 2:34:56.120]  Wayne Madson
[2:34:56.120 --> 2:34:58.120]  Well certainly this Copenhagen thing
[2:34:58.120 --> 2:35:00.120]  Is turned into a you know basically
[2:35:00.120 --> 2:35:02.120]  A three ring circus and I think a lot of people
[2:35:02.120 --> 2:35:04.120]  Who went over there who had
[2:35:04.120 --> 2:35:06.120]  Justified peers that
[2:35:06.120 --> 2:35:08.120]  Whatever they came from in the world
[2:35:08.120 --> 2:35:10.120]  That was low lying South Pacific
[2:35:10.120 --> 2:35:12.120]  Islands or
[2:35:12.120 --> 2:35:14.120]  In the Andes where the glaciers
[2:35:14.120 --> 2:35:16.120]  They're disappearing and their water
[2:35:16.120 --> 2:35:18.120]  Is becoming
[2:35:18.120 --> 2:35:20.120]  Scarcer they all went to Copenhagen
[2:35:20.120 --> 2:35:22.120]  Thinking something good was going to happen
[2:35:22.120 --> 2:35:24.120]  They're looking there now and seeing
[2:35:24.120 --> 2:35:26.120]  George Soros, Hillary Clinton with
[2:35:26.120 --> 2:35:28.120]  You know billions of dollars a day
[2:35:28.120 --> 2:35:30.120]  Carbon this carbon exchange
[2:35:30.120 --> 2:35:32.120]  Program that looks you know it's something
[2:35:32.120 --> 2:35:34.120]  Like I think the carbon exchange
[2:35:34.120 --> 2:35:36.120]  Is something Bernie made up is now
[2:35:36.120 --> 2:35:38.120]  Watching he you know was
[2:35:38.120 --> 2:35:40.120]  Out of prison and involved with
[2:35:40.120 --> 2:35:42.120]  He's probably kicking himself
[2:35:42.120 --> 2:35:44.120]  Well Ken Light didn't invent it I mean
[2:35:44.120 --> 2:35:46.120]  Alright and
[2:35:46.120 --> 2:35:48.120]  So what's all these people
[2:35:48.120 --> 2:35:50.120]  What have they encountered in Copenhagen
[2:35:50.120 --> 2:35:52.120]  But police
[2:35:52.120 --> 2:35:54.120]  Tear gassing them
[2:35:54.120 --> 2:35:56.120]  Arresting them en masse just like
[2:35:56.120 --> 2:35:58.120]  We saw at the anti-G8 meetings
[2:35:58.120 --> 2:36:00.120]  Just as we saw
[2:36:00.120 --> 2:36:02.120]  At Davos and other places where
[2:36:02.120 --> 2:36:04.120]  These same people get together
[2:36:04.120 --> 2:36:06.120]  And I think many people
[2:36:06.120 --> 2:36:08.120]  Who are you know members
[2:36:08.120 --> 2:36:10.120]  Of Greenpeace, the era club
[2:36:10.120 --> 2:36:12.120]  Well wildlife you know people
[2:36:12.120 --> 2:36:14.120]  You know concerned about
[2:36:14.120 --> 2:36:16.120]  The environment and the climate
[2:36:16.120 --> 2:36:18.120]  Part of looking and saying what in the world
[2:36:18.120 --> 2:36:20.120]  Is this mess and you know to see
[2:36:20.120 --> 2:36:22.120]  There's the porters
[2:36:22.120 --> 2:36:24.120]  You know people from indigenous areas
[2:36:24.120 --> 2:36:26.120]  Around the world being arrested en masse
[2:36:26.120 --> 2:36:28.120]  You know you've got Hugo Chavez
[2:36:28.120 --> 2:36:30.120]  Going to Copenhagen, Abel Morales
[2:36:30.120 --> 2:36:32.120]  To Bolivia, Daniel Artega
[2:36:32.120 --> 2:36:34.120]  Nicaragua, they're looking at
[2:36:34.120 --> 2:36:36.120]  Their fellow countrymen being arrested
[2:36:36.120 --> 2:36:38.120]  And they're shaking their heads and they're
[2:36:38.120 --> 2:36:40.120]  And they're looking around who they see
[2:36:40.120 --> 2:36:42.120]  They see the usual suspects, Obama
[2:36:42.120 --> 2:36:44.120]  I'm surprised Tony Blair he probably
[2:36:44.120 --> 2:36:46.120]  Wanted to be there but he may be facing
[2:36:46.120 --> 2:36:48.120]  War crimes charges soon
[2:36:48.120 --> 2:36:50.120]  He tried to run for president of Europe
[2:36:50.120 --> 2:36:52.120]  And he lost that but it's that same crowd
[2:36:52.120 --> 2:36:54.120]  They're looking around at these people
[2:36:54.120 --> 2:36:56.120]  Who you see at all these various
[2:36:56.120 --> 2:36:58.120]  Global meetings and they're shaking
[2:36:58.120 --> 2:37:00.120]  Their heads they said you know I'm sure
[2:37:00.120 --> 2:37:02.120]  This is like a triple cross
[2:37:02.120 --> 2:37:04.120]  This is really like a triple cross
[2:37:04.120 --> 2:37:06.120]  That's right they suckered the third world
[2:37:06.120 --> 2:37:08.120]  And said you're going to get a bunch of loot
[2:37:08.120 --> 2:37:10.120]  From the west they show up
[2:37:10.120 --> 2:37:12.120]  They get the actual trading and it says
[2:37:12.120 --> 2:37:14.120]  They've got to make right at double the
[2:37:14.120 --> 2:37:16.120]  Carbon cuts the west does and the money
[2:37:16.120 --> 2:37:18.120]  Is not even paid to the UN
[2:37:18.120 --> 2:37:20.120]  It's paid directly to the World Bank
[2:37:20.120 --> 2:37:22.120]  On the IMF I mean that is a
[2:37:22.120 --> 2:37:24.120]  Bold fraud
[2:37:24.120 --> 2:37:26.120]  Right and then you have soil over there talking
[2:37:26.120 --> 2:37:28.120]  About special drawing rights
[2:37:28.120 --> 2:37:30.120]  For the IMF money
[2:37:30.120 --> 2:37:32.120]  And you know anytime you see sorrows
[2:37:32.120 --> 2:37:34.120]  Involve in anything you know run for the exit
[2:37:34.120 --> 2:37:36.120]  Because somebody's going to have their pocket
[2:37:36.120 --> 2:37:38.120]  Picked pretty liberally
[2:37:38.120 --> 2:37:40.120]  And but he's not
[2:37:40.120 --> 2:37:42.120]  Certainly the only one it's you know
[2:37:42.120 --> 2:37:44.120]  Just this whole crowd
[2:37:44.120 --> 2:37:46.120]  Ban Ki-moon the UN secretary general
[2:37:46.120 --> 2:37:48.120]  He's you know he's not liked by a lot
[2:37:48.120 --> 2:37:50.120]  Of the smaller countries the developing
[2:37:50.120 --> 2:37:52.120]  Countries they know he's a proxy for the
[2:37:52.120 --> 2:37:54.120]  United States and the US allies
[2:37:54.120 --> 2:37:56.120]  In the banking sector
[2:37:56.120 --> 2:37:58.120]  And like I say people are just shaking
[2:37:58.120 --> 2:38:00.120]  Their heads in Copenhagen saying how
[2:38:00.120 --> 2:38:02.120]  And then they're looking at Obama with the Nobel
[2:38:02.120 --> 2:38:04.120]  Peace Prize for that key getting
[2:38:04.120 --> 2:38:06.120]  Time person of the year you know it
[2:38:06.120 --> 2:38:08.120]  Doesn't take these people very much
[2:38:08.120 --> 2:38:10.120]  This is like Kurt Vonnegut satire
[2:38:10.120 --> 2:38:12.120]  Exactly
[2:38:12.120 --> 2:38:14.120]  Exactly this is something out of the
[2:38:14.120 --> 2:38:16.120]  Bizarro world on Superman
[2:38:16.120 --> 2:38:18.120]  It really is insane
[2:38:18.120 --> 2:38:20.120]  So what do you see coming out of this
[2:38:20.120 --> 2:38:22.120]  In agreement to agree because Obama's
[2:38:22.120 --> 2:38:24.120]  Saying he doesn't care if the world
[2:38:24.120 --> 2:38:26.120]  Doesn't sign on and we're going to play
[2:38:26.120 --> 2:38:28.120]  The speech later he's saying he's
[2:38:28.120 --> 2:38:30.120]  Going to go ahead and pledge the money
[2:38:30.120 --> 2:38:32.120]  To the world bank to then give loan
[2:38:32.120 --> 2:38:34.120]  Sharking rate loans to the third
[2:38:34.120 --> 2:38:36.120]  World that's their assistance
[2:38:36.120 --> 2:38:38.120]  The third world's already learned
[2:38:38.120 --> 2:38:40.120]  About that assistance
[2:38:40.120 --> 2:38:42.120]  Well I think what we're going to see is
[2:38:42.120 --> 2:38:44.120]  Basically a gridlock out of Copenhagen
[2:38:44.120 --> 2:38:46.120]  There'll be some kind of motherhood
[2:38:46.120 --> 2:38:48.120]  Apple pie statement
[2:38:48.120 --> 2:38:50.120]  You know people will smile
[2:38:50.120 --> 2:38:52.120]  And say they agreed to it but there'll
[2:38:52.120 --> 2:38:54.120]  Be a lot of world leaders leaving there
[2:38:54.120 --> 2:38:56.120]  Especially those from Africa Latin America
[2:38:56.120 --> 2:38:58.120]  South Pacific Asia shaking their heads
[2:38:58.120 --> 2:39:00.120]  And saying this is what we expected
[2:39:00.120 --> 2:39:02.120]  This was typical
[2:39:02.120 --> 2:39:04.120]  Of these big countries
[2:39:04.120 --> 2:39:06.120]  The western countries
[2:39:06.120 --> 2:39:08.120]  And I think then we'll probably
[2:39:08.120 --> 2:39:10.120]  Hear about some future meetings somewhere
[2:39:10.120 --> 2:39:12.120]  And we'll get a lot of propaganda
[2:39:12.120 --> 2:39:14.120]  About I don't know where it'll be
[2:39:14.120 --> 2:39:16.120]  And maybe some other city
[2:39:16.120 --> 2:39:18.120]  We've already seen them in Kyoto and Jakarta
[2:39:18.120 --> 2:39:20.120]  We'll probably pick up some
[2:39:20.120 --> 2:39:22.120]  Other city and you know this is going to
[2:39:22.120 --> 2:39:24.120]  Probably become like the Olympics
[2:39:24.120 --> 2:39:26.120]  Everybody's going to try to get this
[2:39:26.120 --> 2:39:28.120]  Climate change conference to make some money
[2:39:30.120 --> 2:39:32.120]  Shifting gears
[2:39:32.120 --> 2:39:34.120]  To the war
[2:39:34.120 --> 2:39:36.120]  For those that don't know maybe give them some background
[2:39:36.120 --> 2:39:38.120]  Of course the Downing Street memo
[2:39:38.120 --> 2:39:40.120]  The White House memo
[2:39:40.120 --> 2:39:42.120]  It's confirmed that Blair and Bush
[2:39:42.120 --> 2:39:44.120]  Knew there were no WMD's
[2:39:44.120 --> 2:39:46.120]  It's not that they screwed up and were wrong
[2:39:46.120 --> 2:39:48.120]  They lied premeditatedly
[2:39:48.120 --> 2:39:50.120]  Well they wanted the weapons sales
[2:39:50.120 --> 2:39:52.120]  They wanted to box in Iran and China and Russia
[2:39:52.120 --> 2:39:54.120]  And get their set pieces in there
[2:39:54.120 --> 2:39:56.120]  For future conflicts
[2:39:56.120 --> 2:39:58.120]  Like 888 that blew up in their face
[2:39:58.120 --> 2:40:00.120]  Thank God
[2:40:00.120 --> 2:40:02.120]  But now more is coming out
[2:40:02.120 --> 2:40:04.120]  That Blair knew it was premeditated
[2:40:04.120 --> 2:40:06.120]  And so there's talk of war crimes
[2:40:06.120 --> 2:40:08.120]  Charges against him
[2:40:08.120 --> 2:40:10.120]  Obama is expanding the war
[2:40:10.120 --> 2:40:12.120]  I mean this is
[2:40:12.120 --> 2:40:14.120]  What is the rest of the world
[2:40:14.120 --> 2:40:16.120]  Saying about this
[2:40:16.120 --> 2:40:18.120]  I think what we're seeing with Tony Blair
[2:40:18.120 --> 2:40:20.120]  He's now going to be testifying before the
[2:40:20.120 --> 2:40:22.120]  Chilcot Inquiry in London
[2:40:22.120 --> 2:40:24.120]  We've seen already some
[2:40:24.120 --> 2:40:26.120]  Testimonies pretty explosive
[2:40:26.120 --> 2:40:28.120]  Out of there saying that Blair of course
[2:40:28.120 --> 2:40:30.120]  Knew there was no WMD's
[2:40:30.120 --> 2:40:32.120]  Decided to go to war against Iraq anyway
[2:40:32.120 --> 2:40:34.120]  You know preemptive
[2:40:34.120 --> 2:40:36.120]  Warfare is against the Nuremberg
[2:40:36.120 --> 2:40:38.120]  What we got out of the Nuremberg
[2:40:38.120 --> 2:40:40.120]  Trials with the war crime
[2:40:40.120 --> 2:40:42.120]  And I think we're going to see
[2:40:42.120 --> 2:40:44.120]  Greater calls for Tony Blair
[2:40:44.120 --> 2:40:46.120]  To be prosecuted
[2:40:46.120 --> 2:40:48.120]  In the Hague and if that happens
[2:40:48.120 --> 2:40:50.120]  Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney and Mr. Rumsfeld
[2:40:50.120 --> 2:40:52.120]  Better watch out because they may be
[2:40:52.120 --> 2:40:54.120]  In fact next Blair may sit a precedent
[2:40:54.120 --> 2:40:56.120]  Now Blair's going to be testifying
[2:40:56.120 --> 2:40:58.120]  In public we understand
[2:40:58.120 --> 2:41:00.120]  And it'll be very interesting to hear what he has to say
[2:41:00.120 --> 2:41:02.120]  But obviously he's been caught
[2:41:02.120 --> 2:41:04.120]  He's been caught with his pants down
[2:41:04.120 --> 2:41:06.120]  On this one
[2:41:06.120 --> 2:41:08.120]  Now he may try to get out of it
[2:41:08.120 --> 2:41:10.120]  He wanted to be a good ally to George Bush
[2:41:10.120 --> 2:41:12.120]  And if that happens
[2:41:12.120 --> 2:41:14.120]  Of course the onus will shift Mr. Bush
[2:41:14.120 --> 2:41:16.120]  And Mr. Cheney
[2:41:16.120 --> 2:41:18.120]  And notice they've been hiding out
[2:41:18.120 --> 2:41:20.120]  You never see them anymore
[2:41:20.120 --> 2:41:22.120]  Yeah Cheney was kind of active
[2:41:22.120 --> 2:41:24.120]  With his mouth a few months ago
[2:41:24.120 --> 2:41:26.120]  But I noticed he's been
[2:41:26.120 --> 2:41:28.120]  Probably he's working on his memoirs
[2:41:28.120 --> 2:41:30.120]  They're going to be out apparently
[2:41:30.120 --> 2:41:32.120]  In 2011
[2:41:32.120 --> 2:41:34.120]  But he's probably spending a lot of time
[2:41:34.120 --> 2:41:36.120]  At his nice home
[2:41:36.120 --> 2:41:38.120]  Over on the eastern shore of Maryland
[2:41:38.120 --> 2:41:40.120]  And out of his private
[2:41:40.120 --> 2:41:42.120]  Community in Wyoming
[2:41:42.120 --> 2:41:44.120]  Or he's in the Darth Vader egg
[2:41:44.120 --> 2:41:46.120]  Right well he's also has a
[2:41:46.120 --> 2:41:48.120]  He has a big house he built
[2:41:48.120 --> 2:41:50.120]  Right near the CIA headquarters
[2:41:50.120 --> 2:41:52.120]  In McLean Virginia but
[2:41:52.120 --> 2:41:54.120]  He's probably being the artful dodger
[2:41:54.120 --> 2:41:56.120]  He's probably going between the various
[2:41:56.120 --> 2:41:58.120]  Homes though in case there is
[2:41:58.120 --> 2:42:00.120]  Any interpoll
[2:42:00.120 --> 2:42:02.120]  A red swan put out he's probably going to be
[2:42:02.120 --> 2:42:04.120]  Pretty hard to nap
[2:42:04.120 --> 2:42:06.120]  I don't think they're going to let interpoll
[2:42:06.120 --> 2:42:08.120]  Go after Lord Cheney
[2:42:08.120 --> 2:42:10.120]  But in closing
[2:42:10.120 --> 2:42:12.120]  Wayne Madsen I want to
[2:42:12.120 --> 2:42:14.120]  Get into healthcare
[2:42:14.120 --> 2:42:16.120]  Now folks I've been telling people
[2:42:16.120 --> 2:42:18.120]  Since we got the first versions of these bills
[2:42:18.120 --> 2:42:20.120]  Five six months ago there's been
[2:42:20.120 --> 2:42:22.120]  I don't know more than ten versions now
[2:42:22.120 --> 2:42:24.120]  Every one of the versions was written
[2:42:24.120 --> 2:42:26.120]  And their lobbyists have bragged
[2:42:26.120 --> 2:42:28.120]  To the Wall Street Journal
[2:42:28.120 --> 2:42:30.120]  The head lobbyists for the healthcare industry
[2:42:30.120 --> 2:42:32.120]  And the other head lobbyists because they
[2:42:32.120 --> 2:42:34.120]  Have consortium leaders for the
[2:42:34.120 --> 2:42:36.120]  Insurance companies said
[2:42:36.120 --> 2:42:38.120]  What about this bill?
[2:42:38.120 --> 2:42:40.120]  Well of course they wrote it
[2:42:40.120 --> 2:42:42.120]  We're talking about five years in prison
[2:42:42.120 --> 2:42:44.120]  Quarter million dollar fines
[2:42:44.120 --> 2:42:46.120]  2.5 to 5% of your paycheck
[2:42:46.120 --> 2:42:48.120]  Depending on your
[2:42:48.120 --> 2:42:50.120]  Your tax bracket
[2:42:50.120 --> 2:42:52.120]  Put into a fund
[2:42:52.120 --> 2:42:54.120]  All of this is going on
[2:42:54.120 --> 2:42:56.120]  And
[2:42:56.120 --> 2:42:58.120]  It gives liability protection
[2:42:58.120 --> 2:43:00.120]  To the insurance companies and the doctors
[2:43:00.120 --> 2:43:02.120]  It does federalize
[2:43:02.120 --> 2:43:04.120]  And let bureaucrats start
[2:43:04.120 --> 2:43:06.120]  Treatments for people
[2:43:06.120 --> 2:43:08.120]  It cuts back on tests that are essential
[2:43:08.120 --> 2:43:10.120]  This is eugenics
[2:43:10.120 --> 2:43:12.120]  And now the actual
[2:43:12.120 --> 2:43:14.120]  Socialists have discovered this
[2:43:14.120 --> 2:43:16.120]  So Howard Dean is freaking out
[2:43:16.120 --> 2:43:18.120]  Dennis Cassinage is freaking out
[2:43:18.120 --> 2:43:20.120]  And the bill was already in trouble
[2:43:20.120 --> 2:43:22.120]  Breakdown was really in the bill
[2:43:22.120 --> 2:43:24.120]  Why we are seeing some
[2:43:24.120 --> 2:43:26.120]  Actual honesty from the Democratic Party
[2:43:26.120 --> 2:43:28.120]  Some sectors of it and what you think
[2:43:28.120 --> 2:43:30.120]  Is going to happen with this bill
[2:43:30.120 --> 2:43:32.120]  Wayne Madsen
[2:43:32.120 --> 2:43:34.120]  A proposal to extend
[2:43:34.120 --> 2:43:36.120]  Medicare benefits to people
[2:43:36.120 --> 2:43:38.120]  55 and older
[2:43:38.120 --> 2:43:40.120]  Over
[2:43:40.120 --> 2:43:42.120]  That was taken out
[2:43:42.120 --> 2:43:44.120]  Joe Lieberman went after that one
[2:43:44.120 --> 2:43:46.120]  We also saw another proposal
[2:43:46.120 --> 2:43:48.120]  To have a public option
[2:43:48.120 --> 2:43:50.120]  Basically emaciated
[2:43:50.120 --> 2:43:52.120]  That's why the Obama
[2:43:52.120 --> 2:43:54.120]  Administration and their congressional supporters
[2:43:54.120 --> 2:43:56.120]  Have lost the support of people like Howard Dean
[2:43:56.120 --> 2:43:58.120]  Russ Feingold
[2:43:58.120 --> 2:44:00.120]  All people I might add
[2:44:00.120 --> 2:44:02.120]  There may be potential challengers
[2:44:02.120 --> 2:44:04.120]  To Mr. Obama
[2:44:04.120 --> 2:44:06.120]  In the 2012 primary
[2:44:06.120 --> 2:44:08.120]  We're hearing a lot more about him
[2:44:08.120 --> 2:44:10.120]  Maybe even having more potential challengers
[2:44:10.120 --> 2:44:12.120]  Than Lyndon Johnson had in 68
[2:44:12.120 --> 2:44:14.120]  Unpopularity over the war
[2:44:14.120 --> 2:44:16.120]  The self care fiasco
[2:44:16.120 --> 2:44:18.120]  Johnson of course
[2:44:18.120 --> 2:44:20.120]  Had Eugene McCarthy and Bobby Kennedy
[2:44:20.120 --> 2:44:22.120]  And decided he wasn't going to run again
[2:44:22.120 --> 2:44:24.120]  But
[2:44:24.120 --> 2:44:26.120]  The Obama may face actually more challengers
[2:44:26.120 --> 2:44:28.120]  Than Mr. Johnson did
[2:44:28.120 --> 2:44:30.120]  In his final term
[2:44:30.120 --> 2:44:32.120]  But what we're seeing is
[2:44:32.120 --> 2:44:34.120]  Now we're hearing calls
[2:44:34.120 --> 2:44:36.120]  People may refuse on masks
[2:44:36.120 --> 2:44:38.120]  To pay the fine nationwide
[2:44:38.120 --> 2:44:40.120]  These are not coming from teabaggers
[2:44:40.120 --> 2:44:42.120]  These are coming from people
[2:44:42.120 --> 2:44:44.120]  Who are on the progressive side of the Democratic Party
[2:44:44.120 --> 2:44:46.120]  So it's a very interesting dynamic
[2:44:46.120 --> 2:44:48.120]  We're seeing here
[2:44:48.120 --> 2:44:50.120]  The loud protest
[2:44:50.120 --> 2:44:52.120]  Talking about
[2:44:52.120 --> 2:44:54.120]  Massively refused to pay the fine
[2:44:54.120 --> 2:44:56.120]  It's coming from the left
[2:44:56.120 --> 2:44:58.120]  And
[2:44:58.120 --> 2:45:00.120]  I'm not sure that's what Mr. Obama bargained for
[2:45:00.120 --> 2:45:02.120]  I'll tell you, one guy in Washington
[2:45:02.120 --> 2:45:04.120]  Is not very popular, is Rahm Emanuel
[2:45:04.120 --> 2:45:06.120]  The Chief of Staff
[2:45:06.120 --> 2:45:08.120]  There are calls for his head
[2:45:08.120 --> 2:45:10.120]  From some of the people
[2:45:10.120 --> 2:45:12.120]  On the progressive side of the Democratic Party
[2:45:12.120 --> 2:45:14.120]  In Congress and I'd be surprised to see
[2:45:14.120 --> 2:45:16.120]  Mr. Emanuel
[2:45:16.120 --> 2:45:18.120]  Last much past the new year
[2:45:18.120 --> 2:45:20.120]  That's right, Politico and The Hill
[2:45:20.120 --> 2:45:22.120]  Both DC based
[2:45:22.120 --> 2:45:24.120]  Publications for folks that aren't aware
[2:45:24.120 --> 2:45:26.120]  Of the fact
[2:45:26.120 --> 2:45:28.120]  That they're not just
[2:45:28.120 --> 2:45:30.120]  Web publications, but based out of DC
[2:45:30.120 --> 2:45:32.120]  They're both seeing that Emanuel
[2:45:32.120 --> 2:45:34.120]  Just calls up and screams at
[2:45:34.120 --> 2:45:36.120]  Senior Congressman
[2:45:36.120 --> 2:45:38.120]  In a Hitlerian fashion
[2:45:38.120 --> 2:45:40.120]  That is going to blow up in their face
[2:45:40.120 --> 2:45:42.120]  And I've seen this with hype machines
[2:45:42.120 --> 2:45:44.120]  The bigger they build something up
[2:45:44.120 --> 2:45:46.120]  If it doesn't deliver
[2:45:46.120 --> 2:45:48.120]  It implodes even faster
[2:45:48.120 --> 2:45:50.120]  And Obama, for the last six months
[2:45:50.120 --> 2:45:52.120]  Has had the lowest approval rating of any president
[2:45:52.120 --> 2:45:54.120]  This far into
[2:45:54.120 --> 2:45:56.120]  His first year
[2:45:56.120 --> 2:45:58.120]  And now he's
[2:45:58.120 --> 2:46:00.120]  Even breaking
[2:46:00.120 --> 2:46:02.120]  His own records, I mean
[2:46:02.120 --> 2:46:04.120]  It is a dive straight
[2:46:04.120 --> 2:46:06.120]  Downward, because people are finding out
[2:46:06.120 --> 2:46:08.120]  This is a warmongering
[2:46:08.120 --> 2:46:10.120]  Police state loving
[2:46:10.120 --> 2:46:12.120]  Secret arresting, rendition
[2:46:12.120 --> 2:46:14.120]  Promoting, lobbyist
[2:46:14.120 --> 2:46:16.120]  Hiring, neocon
[2:46:16.120 --> 2:46:18.120]  Masquerading as a communist
[2:46:18.120 --> 2:46:20.120]  You and I hear people calling him a communist
[2:46:20.120 --> 2:46:22.120]  No, he's a corporate looter
[2:46:22.120 --> 2:46:24.120]  Right, right, and I'm hearing
[2:46:24.120 --> 2:46:26.120]  A lot of people now talking about this
[2:46:26.120 --> 2:46:28.120]  Being the third term of George W. Bush
[2:46:28.120 --> 2:46:30.120]  I mean, and these are serious people
[2:46:30.120 --> 2:46:32.120]  They're, I mean, they're joking
[2:46:32.120 --> 2:46:34.120]  But they're really kind of serious
[2:46:34.120 --> 2:46:36.120]  And making no allegations
[2:46:36.120 --> 2:46:38.120]  But the other thing that's interesting
[2:46:38.120 --> 2:46:40.120]  Is we have a federal judge now
[2:46:40.120 --> 2:46:42.120]  Who's been assigned to Rod Blagojevich
[2:46:42.120 --> 2:46:44.120]  Criminal case in Illinois
[2:46:44.120 --> 2:46:46.120]  Now stating that he would not be opposed
[2:46:46.120 --> 2:46:48.120]  To the defense
[2:46:48.120 --> 2:46:50.120]  Mr. Emanuelle
[2:46:50.120 --> 2:46:52.120]  Get ready for this, Mr. Obama
[2:46:52.120 --> 2:46:54.120]  And on that whole thing with the
[2:46:54.120 --> 2:46:56.120]  Selling of the Obama senate seat
[2:46:56.120 --> 2:46:58.120]  If that happens, if the president
[2:46:58.120 --> 2:47:00.120]  Will try to invoke executive privilege
[2:47:00.120 --> 2:47:02.120]  And so will probably Emanuelle
[2:47:02.120 --> 2:47:04.120]  I don't know how he'll do it though
[2:47:04.120 --> 2:47:06.120]  Because all this happened before they were sworn in
[2:47:06.120 --> 2:47:08.120]  Or became, you know, in case of Obama
[2:47:08.120 --> 2:47:10.120]  Sworn in, Emanuelle being appointed
[2:47:10.120 --> 2:47:12.120]  Chief of staff, but we could
[2:47:12.120 --> 2:47:14.120]  Have a real constitutional crisis
[2:47:14.120 --> 2:47:16.120]  On top of everything else
[2:47:16.120 --> 2:47:18.120]  Does not bode well for this administration
[2:47:18.120 --> 2:47:20.120]  If that should occur
[2:47:20.120 --> 2:47:22.120]  Well, that starts happening
[2:47:22.120 --> 2:47:24.120]  Look for Blagojevich's aircraft
[2:47:24.120 --> 2:47:26.120]  Who blow up for him to have a sudden aneurysm
[2:47:26.120 --> 2:47:30.120]  Or a 72-hour brain tumor
[2:47:30.120 --> 2:47:32.120]  Absolutely, well, we'll have to see
[2:47:32.120 --> 2:47:34.120]  How that one goes, but we all remember
[2:47:34.120 --> 2:47:36.120]  The height when Bill Clinton, of course
[2:47:36.120 --> 2:47:38.120]  Had to testify in the
[2:47:38.120 --> 2:47:40.120]  In the Paul Jones case
[2:47:40.120 --> 2:47:42.120]  With the independent prosecutor
[2:47:42.120 --> 2:47:44.120]  Kenneth Starr
[2:47:44.120 --> 2:47:46.120]  And that, you know, we had talk
[2:47:46.120 --> 2:47:48.120]  Of a constitutional crisis there
[2:47:48.120 --> 2:47:50.120]  But that certainly did not do much
[2:47:50.120 --> 2:47:52.120]  For Clinton's care members
[2:47:52.120 --> 2:47:54.120]  When you have the sitting president
[2:47:54.120 --> 2:47:56.120]  Testifying in a case like that
[2:47:56.120 --> 2:47:58.120]  We may see the same thing happen
[2:47:58.120 --> 2:48:00.120]  To Mr. Obama, and of course
[2:48:00.120 --> 2:48:02.120]  Emanuelle and David Axelrod
[2:48:02.120 --> 2:48:04.120]  Valerie Jarrett and other key members
[2:48:04.120 --> 2:48:06.120]  Of this administration
[2:48:06.120 --> 2:48:08.120]  So do you think the health care is
[2:48:08.120 --> 2:48:10.120]  Going to pass?
[2:48:10.120 --> 2:48:12.120]  I think it will pass
[2:48:12.120 --> 2:48:14.120]  And what we see come out
[2:48:14.120 --> 2:48:16.120]  Is not going to be very much
[2:48:16.120 --> 2:48:18.120]  I think people who
[2:48:18.120 --> 2:48:20.120]  Are hoping to see something
[2:48:20.120 --> 2:48:22.120]  For people who are uninsured
[2:48:22.120 --> 2:48:24.120]  Are going to be sadly disappointed
[2:48:24.120 --> 2:48:26.120]  The fact is, isn't it funny
[2:48:26.120 --> 2:48:28.120]  The guy that this all hinges on
[2:48:28.120 --> 2:48:30.120]  Is Joe Lieberman
[2:48:30.120 --> 2:48:32.120]  The guy who supported McCain
[2:48:32.120 --> 2:48:34.120]  In the last election
[2:48:34.120 --> 2:48:36.120]  Was Al Gore's running mate
[2:48:36.120 --> 2:48:38.120]  Of course in 2000
[2:48:38.120 --> 2:48:40.120]  Who was put in the Senate from Connecticut
[2:48:40.120 --> 2:48:42.120]  He hated the sitting Republican
[2:48:42.120 --> 2:48:44.120]  Lawl Weicker so much
[2:48:44.120 --> 2:48:46.120]  Who was considered too liberal
[2:48:46.120 --> 2:48:48.120]  He said, I'd rather have a conservative Democrat
[2:48:48.120 --> 2:48:50.120]  In that seat than Lawl Weicker
[2:48:50.120 --> 2:48:52.120]  And hence we got Lieberman
[2:48:52.120 --> 2:48:54.120]  Lieberman is basically a Republican
[2:48:54.120 --> 2:48:56.120]  Parading around as a Democrat
[2:48:56.120 --> 2:48:58.120]  Finally maybe some people waking up
[2:48:58.120 --> 2:49:00.120]  And seeing him for what he really is
[2:49:00.120 --> 2:49:02.120]  Well Wayne, my issue is
[2:49:02.120 --> 2:49:04.120]  Anything they do, even if you're for
[2:49:04.120 --> 2:49:06.120]  Socialist health care
[2:49:06.120 --> 2:49:08.120]  Then it better be socialist
[2:49:08.120 --> 2:49:10.120]  This is not socialist
[2:49:10.120 --> 2:49:12.120]  This is just another robbery
[2:49:12.120 --> 2:49:14.120]  And so that's why I'm always against big government
[2:49:14.120 --> 2:49:16.120]  Because it always turns into a swindle
[2:49:16.120 --> 2:49:18.120]  We got a minute and a half left
[2:49:18.120 --> 2:49:20.120]  Russia is announcing they may preemptively
[2:49:20.120 --> 2:49:22.120]  Use nukes if anyone gets
[2:49:22.120 --> 2:49:24.120]  In their business
[2:49:24.120 --> 2:49:26.120]  Well I think obviously you're looking
[2:49:26.120 --> 2:49:28.120]  At NATO now coming right up to their borders
[2:49:28.120 --> 2:49:30.120]  We have
[2:49:30.120 --> 2:49:32.120]  The NATO Secretary General
[2:49:32.120 --> 2:49:34.120]  Rasmussen
[2:49:34.120 --> 2:49:36.120]  Who was the former Danish Prime Minister
[2:49:36.120 --> 2:49:38.120]  He's a neocon
[2:49:38.120 --> 2:49:40.120]  He's going to basically do everything
[2:49:40.120 --> 2:49:42.120]  On the neocon
[2:49:42.120 --> 2:49:44.120]  Playlist
[2:49:44.120 --> 2:49:46.120]  They're looking at all this and they're saying
[2:49:46.120 --> 2:49:48.120]  Well if you're going to play hardball with us
[2:49:48.120 --> 2:49:50.120]  We can play hardball back
[2:49:50.120 --> 2:49:52.120]  And I think we're going to see a lot more
[2:49:52.120 --> 2:49:54.120]  Elements
[2:49:54.120 --> 2:49:56.120]  That are going to look like the Cold War
[2:49:56.120 --> 2:49:58.120]  But I don't think we'll ever go back to those days
[2:49:58.120 --> 2:50:00.120]  But there'll be a lot of grandstandings
[2:50:00.120 --> 2:50:02.120]  Certainly
[2:50:02.120 --> 2:50:04.120]  The US and Russia still have not agreed
[2:50:04.120 --> 2:50:06.120]  On the nuclear
[2:50:06.120 --> 2:50:08.120]  Reduction
[2:50:08.120 --> 2:50:10.120]  Nuclear weapons reduction
[2:50:10.120 --> 2:50:12.120]  Why is the west menacing Russia?
[2:50:12.120 --> 2:50:14.120]  Yeah
[2:50:14.120 --> 2:50:16.120]  Obama doesn't want to do much on that
[2:50:16.120 --> 2:50:18.120]  And there's a lot of complaints
[2:50:18.120 --> 2:50:20.120]  Even out of the State Department
[2:50:20.120 --> 2:50:22.120]  That Obama is dragging his feet on
[2:50:22.120 --> 2:50:24.120]  But why is the west menacing Russia?
[2:50:24.120 --> 2:50:26.120]  Well obviously
[2:50:26.120 --> 2:50:28.120]  They aren't going along with the program
[2:50:28.120 --> 2:50:30.120]  You know the issue of
[2:50:30.120 --> 2:50:32.120]  The breakaway regions of Georgia
[2:50:32.120 --> 2:50:34.120]  Being recognized
[2:50:34.120 --> 2:50:36.120]  That's just one of many issues
[2:50:36.120 --> 2:50:38.120]  And Russia now
[2:50:38.120 --> 2:50:40.120]  Supporting the progressive
[2:50:40.120 --> 2:50:42.120]  Governments in Latin America
[2:50:42.120 --> 2:50:44.120]  That's right in what the US
[2:50:44.120 --> 2:50:46.120]  Consider as its backyard
[2:50:46.120 --> 2:50:48.120]  And obviously the neocons
[2:50:48.120 --> 2:50:50.120]  We're still very much present
[2:50:50.120 --> 2:50:52.120]  Wayne, we're out of time
[2:50:52.120 --> 2:50:54.120]  WayneMadsOfReport.com
[2:50:54.120 --> 2:50:56.120]  We'll talk to you coming up January 30th
[2:50:56.120 --> 2:51:02.120]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[2:51:02.120 --> 2:51:04.120]  In secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[2:51:04.120 --> 2:51:06.120]  Did you know that in a real meltdown
[2:51:06.120 --> 2:51:08.120]  Non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[2:51:08.120 --> 2:51:12.120]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country
[2:51:12.120 --> 2:51:14.120]  And it's possible that could even happen again
[2:51:14.120 --> 2:51:16.120]  So our friends at Solutions from Science
[2:51:16.120 --> 2:51:20.120]  Have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[2:51:20.120 --> 2:51:22.120]  They call it a survival seed bank
[2:51:22.120 --> 2:51:25.120]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[2:51:25.120 --> 2:51:27.120]  For you and your family
[2:51:27.120 --> 2:51:28.120]  And here's the best part
[2:51:28.120 --> 2:51:31.120]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way
[2:51:31.120 --> 2:51:34.120]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden
[2:51:34.120 --> 2:51:37.120]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com
[2:51:37.120 --> 2:51:40.120]  That's survivalseedbank.com
[2:51:40.120 --> 2:51:44.120]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365
[2:51:44.120 --> 2:51:48.120]  That's 877-327-0365
[2:51:48.120 --> 2:51:51.120]  Remember, in a real crisis
[2:51:51.120 --> 2:51:53.120]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item
[2:51:53.120 --> 2:51:56.120]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[2:52:24.120 --> 2:52:28.120]  As we see more and more GMO foods on the shelves
[2:52:28.120 --> 2:52:30.120]  This information is good to know
[2:52:30.120 --> 2:52:32.120]  I am thankful to God for you Linda
[2:52:32.120 --> 2:52:34.120]  I can't say enough about this book
[2:52:34.120 --> 2:52:36.120]  Blessings to you and your family
[2:52:36.120 --> 2:52:39.120]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family
[2:52:39.120 --> 2:52:54.120]  Is that we truly see Earth's bouncy everywhere
[2:53:10.120 --> 2:53:13.120]  Now it's time to release yourself from the grip of big tobacco
[2:53:13.120 --> 2:53:16.120]  And experience true smoking freedom
[2:53:16.120 --> 2:53:18.120]  Powervapor.com is an e-cigarette
[2:53:18.120 --> 2:53:21.120]  With the look, feel and smoke of a real cigarette
[2:53:21.120 --> 2:53:25.120]  But with no tar, no carbon monoxide and no bad odors
[2:53:25.120 --> 2:53:29.120]  Powervapor's e-cigarettes deliver just the right amount of nicotine
[2:53:29.120 --> 2:53:32.120]  In a water vapor that looks and feels like real smoke
[2:53:32.120 --> 2:53:35.120]  Yes, you choose from four levels of nicotine
[2:53:35.120 --> 2:53:37.120]  And that puts you back in control
[2:53:37.120 --> 2:53:39.120]  Plus you'll enjoy eight flavors and big savings

[2:53:54.120 --> 2:54:08.120]  The Smoking Gun, heard round the world
[2:54:24.120 --> 2:54:33.120]  Coming up at the bottom of the next hour
[2:54:33.120 --> 2:54:36.120]  Robert Wannick, a high school student
[2:54:36.120 --> 2:54:40.120]  Who's been really active in 9-Eleven Truth
[2:54:40.120 --> 2:54:42.120]  In exposing the war
[2:54:42.120 --> 2:54:45.120]  In exposing the phony left-right paradigm
[2:54:45.120 --> 2:54:49.120]  He also, I think, was the second or third place winner
[2:54:49.120 --> 2:54:53.120]  Of our flu vaccine or slash poster contest
[2:54:53.120 --> 2:54:56.120]  We said put up whatever posters you want in that contest
[2:54:56.120 --> 2:55:00.120]  But a lot of people chose to expose that the flu vaccine
[2:55:00.120 --> 2:55:03.120]  Insert said it could cause cancer, could cause brain damage
[2:55:03.120 --> 2:55:06.120]  Could cause neurological disorders, had mercury in it
[2:55:06.120 --> 2:55:09.120]  Could sterilize you or hurt your fertility
[2:55:09.120 --> 2:55:13.120]  Lower your fertility, create infertility
[2:55:13.120 --> 2:55:17.120]  And he was just handing out the inserts at his government training camp
[2:55:17.120 --> 2:55:19.120]  Trying to warn his fellow students
[2:55:19.120 --> 2:55:21.120]  And was assaulted by a teacher
[2:55:21.120 --> 2:55:25.120]  Because in America, you don't talk to fellow slaves
[2:55:25.120 --> 2:55:27.120]  Not in the lockdown prison
[2:55:27.120 --> 2:55:29.120]  You're learning how to live like a Soviet
[2:55:29.120 --> 2:55:33.120]  And so we're going to go live at prisonplanet.tv
[2:55:33.120 --> 2:55:36.120]  We did four hours yesterday at prisonplanet.tv
[2:55:36.120 --> 2:55:40.120]  We're just doing an hour and 52 minutes today at the eight after
[2:55:40.120 --> 2:55:44.120]  When we start the second segment of the next hour
[2:55:44.120 --> 2:55:47.120]  We will simulcast the last half of the show
[2:55:47.120 --> 2:55:51.120]  At prisonplanet.tv
[2:55:51.120 --> 2:55:52.120]  And Robert Wannick is joining us
[2:55:52.120 --> 2:56:00.120]  And then John Schaefer of the rock band Iced Earth
[2:56:00.120 --> 2:56:03.120]  Is going to be joining us in studio
[2:56:03.120 --> 2:56:05.120]  Great new album
[2:56:05.120 --> 2:56:11.120]  So you don't want to miss that world premiere here on air for that
[2:56:11.120 --> 2:56:14.120]  His lyrics are excellent
[2:56:14.120 --> 2:56:17.120]  The answer in 1974 is 1776
[2:56:17.120 --> 2:56:19.120]  In the Fed, in the Fed, in the Fed
[2:56:19.120 --> 2:56:25.120]  Certainly the powerful new tool in the fight against the new world order
[2:56:25.120 --> 2:56:29.120]  Now what I'm going to do when we go live at eight after
[2:56:29.120 --> 2:56:31.120]  Is in two segments
[2:56:31.120 --> 2:56:33.120]  I'm going to play Obama's speech
[2:56:33.120 --> 2:56:36.120]  I already started this but only got like two minutes into it
[2:56:36.120 --> 2:56:39.120]  I'm going to play his 10 minute 42 second speech
[2:56:39.120 --> 2:56:42.120]  And I'm going to try to focus
[2:56:42.120 --> 2:56:44.120]  And just pause it
[2:56:44.120 --> 2:56:46.120]  When he tells lies
[2:56:46.120 --> 2:56:48.120]  The problem is everything's a lie
[2:56:48.120 --> 2:56:50.120]  Everything's a fraud and go over it
[2:56:50.120 --> 2:56:52.120]  And then we can post that on YouTube and everywhere else
[2:56:52.120 --> 2:56:57.120]  Of course it will first be posted at prisonplanet.tv for members
[2:56:57.120 --> 2:57:00.120]  And we'll be simulcasting live for prisonplanet.tv
[2:57:00.120 --> 2:57:03.120]  Members, speaking of prisonplanet.tv
[2:57:03.120 --> 2:57:05.120]  Why fight the traffic for holiday gifts
[2:57:05.120 --> 2:57:07.120]  For business gifts
[2:57:07.120 --> 2:57:08.120]  For corporate gifts
[2:57:08.120 --> 2:57:10.120]  For family gifts
[2:57:10.120 --> 2:57:12.120]  I know I'm not fighting traffic
[2:57:12.120 --> 2:57:16.120]  We're doing stuff like making cookies and fudge
[2:57:16.120 --> 2:57:18.120]  And fun stuff to do with the kids
[2:57:18.120 --> 2:57:20.120]  And making homemade cards
[2:57:20.120 --> 2:57:23.120]  That's kind of stuff family likes anyways
[2:57:23.120 --> 2:57:26.120]  Don't go out there and get yourself into a bunch of debt folks during the holidays
[2:57:26.120 --> 2:57:28.120]  If you do have money to spend
[2:57:28.120 --> 2:57:30.120]  Give them a prisonplanet.tv membership
[2:57:30.120 --> 2:57:33.120]  Get a trial membership, $5.95 a month
[2:57:33.120 --> 2:57:35.120]  Create the username, password
[2:57:35.120 --> 2:57:37.120]  And then send it as an e-card to friends and family
[2:57:37.120 --> 2:57:40.120]  Six people can simultaneously log on with the passcode
[2:57:40.120 --> 2:57:42.120]  So you can give yourself a prisonplanet.tv membership
[2:57:42.120 --> 2:57:45.120]  And then I'm letting you know that six IP addresses can
[2:57:45.120 --> 2:57:47.120]  Well that's not how it works
[2:57:47.120 --> 2:57:50.120]  It's six people can log on according to that passcode
[2:57:50.120 --> 2:57:52.120]  That's how it works
[2:57:52.120 --> 2:57:56.120]  And then it blocks it until the person gets off
[2:57:56.120 --> 2:57:58.120]  But you can share it with some friends and family
[2:57:58.120 --> 2:58:00.120]  That's my gift to you
[2:58:00.120 --> 2:58:02.120]  And you can see the live TV show
[2:58:02.120 --> 2:58:04.120]  The best archives, the radio show
[2:58:04.120 --> 2:58:06.120]  My book, Paul Watson's book, all my other films
[2:58:06.120 --> 2:58:08.120]  It's an armory of resistance
[2:58:08.120 --> 2:58:10.120]  Burn them to Divx, CD
[2:58:10.120 --> 2:58:12.120]  Give it to people
[2:58:12.120 --> 2:58:15.120]  Or you can get free t-shirts and DVDs right now
[2:58:15.120 --> 2:58:17.120]  When you order to follow the Republic
[2:58:17.120 --> 2:58:19.120]  And there's a bunch of other free deals and combos
[2:58:19.120 --> 2:58:21.120]  At infowars.com
[2:58:21.120 --> 2:58:26.120]  Or call toll-free 888-253-3139
[2:58:26.120 --> 2:58:28.120]  But if you don't have the money
[2:58:28.120 --> 2:58:30.120]  I really don't care
[2:58:30.120 --> 2:58:32.120]  All the films are free online
[2:58:32.120 --> 2:58:34.120]  Just google the name of all the Republic and watch it
[2:58:34.120 --> 2:58:36.120]  We'll be right back, stay with us
[2:59:04.120 --> 2:59:06.120]  The power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:59:06.120 --> 2:59:08.120]  And now, new socialist legislation
[2:59:08.120 --> 2:59:10.120]  Is only compounding the problem
[2:59:10.120 --> 2:59:13.120]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[2:59:13.120 --> 2:59:15.120]  Every year, thousands of families
[2:59:15.120 --> 2:59:17.120]  Lose their power from weather-related onages
[2:59:17.120 --> 2:59:20.120]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup
[2:59:20.120 --> 2:59:22.120]  Insurance and peace of mind
[2:59:22.120 --> 2:59:24.120]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[2:59:24.120 --> 2:59:26.120]  Offered by Solutions from Science
[2:59:26.120 --> 2:59:28.120]  One of my old sponsors
[2:59:28.120 --> 2:59:31.120]  You can get more information at WU.

[2:59:36.120 --> 2:59:38.120]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun

[3:00:05.120 --> 3:00:06.120]  Well, so does he
[3:00:06.120 --> 3:00:08.120]  He's Alex Jones
[3:00:08.120 --> 3:00:10.120]  On the GCM Radio Network
[3:00:10.120 --> 3:00:13.120]  And now, live from Austin, Texas
[3:00:13.120 --> 3:00:15.120]  Alex Jones
[3:00:18.120 --> 3:00:20.120]  33 minutes from now
[3:00:20.120 --> 3:00:22.120]  Robert Wannick will be joining us
[3:00:22.120 --> 3:00:24.120]  Persecuted in the USS
[3:00:24.120 --> 3:00:26.120]  Arb
[3:00:26.120 --> 3:00:28.120]  What the United States has turned into
[3:00:30.120 --> 3:00:32.120]  Or the U.S.S.A
[3:00:34.120 --> 3:00:36.120]  And then we have
[3:00:36.120 --> 3:00:38.120]  The lead singer of the rock band, Ice Earth
[3:00:38.120 --> 3:00:40.120]  They've been around for a long time
[3:00:40.120 --> 3:00:42.120]  Very popular
[3:00:42.120 --> 3:00:44.120]  They're on a whole bunch of charts
[3:00:44.120 --> 3:00:46.120]  Globally, continually over the years
[3:00:46.120 --> 3:00:48.120]  So it's a top rock band
[3:00:48.120 --> 3:00:50.120]  If you haven't heard of them
[3:00:50.120 --> 3:00:52.120]  The issue is they're putting out a completely free
[3:00:52.120 --> 3:00:54.120]  Album
[3:00:54.120 --> 3:00:56.120]  And they're launching it today on this show
[3:00:56.120 --> 3:00:58.120]  And this is a platinum
[3:00:58.120 --> 3:01:00.120]  Band
[3:01:00.120 --> 3:01:02.120]  So, again, they're getting into the fight
[3:01:02.120 --> 3:01:04.120]  And that's why I just pointed out
[3:01:04.120 --> 3:01:06.120]  My films are all free
[3:01:06.120 --> 3:01:08.120]  Same thing
[3:01:08.120 --> 3:01:10.120]  You want to be tyranny, you got to give something
[3:01:12.120 --> 3:01:14.120]  And I want to salute Ice Earth
[3:01:14.120 --> 3:01:16.120]  For what they're doing
[3:01:16.120 --> 3:01:18.120]  Now look, we're able to fund
[3:01:18.120 --> 3:01:20.120]  Our operation off DVD sales
[3:01:20.120 --> 3:01:22.120]  Radio advertisers
[3:01:26.120 --> 3:01:28.120]  And sometimes it gets tough
[3:01:28.120 --> 3:01:30.120]  But
[3:01:30.120 --> 3:01:32.120]  When you order the DVDs
[3:01:32.120 --> 3:01:34.120]  The books, the materials
[3:01:34.120 --> 3:01:36.120]  That is basically a donation
[3:01:36.120 --> 3:01:38.120]  We're not tax exempt though
[3:01:38.120 --> 3:01:40.120]  Because we're not under the globalist control
[3:01:40.120 --> 3:01:42.120]  We'd be under government control if we did that
[3:01:42.120 --> 3:01:44.120]  Since they've taken over the charities
[3:01:44.120 --> 3:01:46.120]  And the churches, it's totally unconstitutional
[3:01:46.120 --> 3:01:48.120]  But I wish we were tax exempt
[3:01:48.120 --> 3:01:50.120]  I could probably do it if I wanted to
[3:01:50.120 --> 3:01:52.120]  But then that would bring them into my lives
[3:01:52.120 --> 3:01:54.120]  And I don't want to mess with it
[3:01:54.120 --> 3:01:56.120]  The point here is that
[3:01:56.120 --> 3:01:58.120]  When you purchase the books, videos and materials
[3:01:58.120 --> 3:02:00.120]  On the sites, that's how you fund our operation
[3:02:02.120 --> 3:02:04.120]  And it's almost pearls before swine
[3:02:04.120 --> 3:02:06.120]  With some people
[3:02:08.120 --> 3:02:10.120]  Casting out your pearls before swine
[3:02:10.120 --> 3:02:12.120]  At least they turn on you
[3:02:12.120 --> 3:02:14.120]  And rinse you
[3:02:14.120 --> 3:02:16.120]  To tear your guts out
[3:02:16.120 --> 3:02:18.120]  You know, I say, oh, here's a $200,000 film I made
[3:02:20.120 --> 3:02:22.120]  You know, I didn't go out and buy two
[3:02:22.120 --> 3:02:24.120]  Bentley's with this, I made the film
[3:02:24.120 --> 3:02:26.120]  And it's
[3:02:26.120 --> 3:02:28.120]  Free, people go, eh, so what
[3:02:28.120 --> 3:02:30.120]  Yeah, I mean
[3:02:30.120 --> 3:02:32.120]  People on airplanes, interviews
[3:02:32.120 --> 3:02:34.120]  18-hour days, bloodshot eyes
[3:02:34.120 --> 3:02:36.120]  Composing the music
[3:02:36.120 --> 3:02:38.120]  All the work that went into this with my team
[3:02:38.120 --> 3:02:40.120]  And we say, here it is, it's free
[3:02:40.120 --> 3:02:42.120]  And people tend to not appreciate
[3:02:42.120 --> 3:02:44.120]  Something unless they pay for it
[3:02:44.120 --> 3:02:46.120]  It's weird
[3:02:46.120 --> 3:02:48.120]  So I hope you appreciate
[3:02:48.120 --> 3:02:50.120]  What Ice Earth has done
[3:02:50.120 --> 3:02:52.120]  Guaranteed losing millions of dollars
[3:02:52.120 --> 3:02:54.120]  Giving you this for free
[3:02:54.120 --> 3:02:56.120]  And I hope you appreciate what we do here
[3:02:56.120 --> 3:02:58.120]  Because I happen to know smaller filmmakers
[3:02:58.120 --> 3:03:00.120]  Than I that make more money
[3:03:00.120 --> 3:03:02.120]  Because they don't let people duplicate their films
[3:03:02.120 --> 3:03:04.120]  And they don't let people
[3:03:04.120 --> 3:03:06.120]  Have them on the web
[3:03:06.120 --> 3:03:08.120]  And you do end up selling more
[3:03:08.120 --> 3:03:10.120]  It reaches one one hundredth
[3:03:10.120 --> 3:03:12.120]  Of what you would have reached
[3:03:12.120 --> 3:03:14.120]  The minds
[3:03:14.120 --> 3:03:16.120]  The globalists want minds for their evil aims
[3:03:16.120 --> 3:03:18.120]  I want minds because I'm into
[3:03:18.120 --> 3:03:20.120]  Freedom and liberty
[3:03:20.120 --> 3:03:22.120]  And I get excited about the dynamic human spirit
[3:03:22.120 --> 3:03:24.120]  And I get excited about my species
[3:03:24.120 --> 3:03:26.120]  In our future
[3:03:26.120 --> 3:03:28.120]  And I don't want the bad karma
[3:03:28.120 --> 3:03:30.120]  I don't believe in the karma itself, but I like the term
[3:03:30.120 --> 3:03:32.120]  It's really reap what you sow
[3:03:32.120 --> 3:03:34.120]  The average person doesn't know what that means now
[3:03:34.120 --> 3:03:36.120]  But they know what karma is, it's just been made popular
[3:03:36.120 --> 3:03:38.120]  So remember, I'm always kind of reaching out
[3:03:38.120 --> 3:03:40.120]  To some of the lowest common denominator
[3:03:40.120 --> 3:03:42.120]  I know we have listeners that are a lot smarter than I am
[3:03:42.120 --> 3:03:44.120]  But there's some people that don't get it
[3:03:44.120 --> 3:03:46.120]  I don't want to do bad things
[3:03:46.120 --> 3:03:48.120]  Not just because I'm scared of the universe
[3:03:48.120 --> 3:03:50.120]  Coming back at me, but because I enjoy
[3:03:50.120 --> 3:03:52.120]  Doing good
[3:03:54.120 --> 3:03:56.120]  I don't feel good when I help a little old lady
[3:03:56.120 --> 3:03:58.120]  Across the street because I'm into being a goody two shoes
[3:03:58.120 --> 3:04:00.120]  At a fundamental level
[3:04:00.120 --> 3:04:02.120]  Helping people is what I like to do
[3:04:02.120 --> 3:04:04.120]  At a fundamental level
[3:04:04.120 --> 3:04:06.120]  I also want to knock the teeth out of bad people
[3:04:06.120 --> 3:04:08.120]  That's normal folks
[3:04:08.120 --> 3:04:10.120]  And we need to get back to being normal
[3:04:10.120 --> 3:04:12.120]  We become abnormal
[3:04:12.120 --> 3:04:14.120]  How to fit in real good
[3:04:14.120 --> 3:04:16.120]  Three or four thousand years ago folks
[3:04:16.120 --> 3:04:18.120]  You know, living in some
[3:04:20.120 --> 3:04:22.120]  Nordic tribe somewhere
[3:04:22.120 --> 3:04:24.120]  Just normal behavior
[3:04:26.120 --> 3:04:28.120]  That's why people like dogs so much
[3:04:28.120 --> 3:04:30.120]  Because they're so similar to primitive man
[3:04:30.120 --> 3:04:32.120]  It's all straight up
[3:04:32.120 --> 3:04:34.120]  You know what you got with a dog
[3:04:34.120 --> 3:04:36.120]  Not these neurotic, twisted, gibbering, lying
[3:04:36.120 --> 3:04:38.120]  Demon creatures that we call human beings
[3:04:38.120 --> 3:04:40.120]  We have got to stand up
[3:04:40.120 --> 3:04:42.120]  Against the new world order
[3:04:42.120 --> 3:04:44.120]  So please, support us
[3:04:44.120 --> 3:04:46.120]  And since the films are free online
[3:04:46.120 --> 3:04:48.120]  Get the URLs for the free films
[3:04:48.120 --> 3:04:50.120]  And email it out
[3:04:50.120 --> 3:04:52.120]  To everybody you know
[3:04:52.120 --> 3:04:54.120]  We'll be right back
[3:04:54.120 --> 3:04:56.120]  Hello this is Alex Jones
[3:04:56.120 --> 3:04:58.120]  With some important questions
[3:04:58.120 --> 3:05:00.120]  If you're going into a battle
[3:05:00.120 --> 3:05:02.120]  And they give you a rifle and a sidearm
[3:05:02.120 --> 3:05:04.120]  How much ammunition do you want
[3:05:04.120 --> 3:05:06.120]  There be all I can get
[3:05:06.120 --> 3:05:08.120]  In the battle for freedom

[3:05:10.120 --> 3:05:12.120]  Food is your only ammunition
[3:05:12.120 --> 3:05:14.120]  How much do you want
[3:05:14.120 --> 3:05:16.120]  When do you want it
[3:05:16.120 --> 3:05:18.120]  Now or after the battle starts
[3:05:18.120 --> 3:05:20.120]  When will you need it
[3:05:20.120 --> 3:05:22.120]  Can you buy it without proper identification
[3:05:22.120 --> 3:05:24.120]  Will there be any food
[3:05:24.120 --> 3:05:26.120]  Will it make your children sick
[3:05:26.120 --> 3:05:28.120]  If there's a quarantine
[3:05:28.120 --> 3:05:30.120]  And you can't feed yourself
[3:05:30.120 --> 3:05:32.120]  Will you go to the gathering center
[3:05:32.120 --> 3:05:34.120]  For freedom and your life
[3:05:34.120 --> 3:05:36.120]  How much will you need
[3:05:36.120 --> 3:05:38.120]  We don't know

[3:08:18.120 --> 3:08:20.120]  Welcome to the live video
[3:08:20.120 --> 3:08:22.120]  At www.prisonplanet.tv
[3:08:22.120 --> 3:08:24.120]  Coming up, Health Care Bill
[3:08:24.120 --> 3:08:26.120]  Wouldn't bring real reform
[3:08:26.120 --> 3:08:28.120]  Howard Dean says he's getting ready
[3:08:28.120 --> 3:08:30.120]  To get somebody to run against Obama
[3:08:30.120 --> 3:08:32.120]  In 2012
[3:08:34.120 --> 3:08:36.120]  Because he knows Obama is going to be out of there
[3:08:36.120 --> 3:08:38.120]  This is the third
[3:08:38.120 --> 3:08:40.120]  Administration of George W. Bush
[3:08:40.120 --> 3:08:42.120]  This is a colossal hoax
[3:08:42.120 --> 3:08:44.120]  From George W. Bush
[3:08:44.120 --> 3:08:46.120]  From George W. Bush
[3:08:46.120 --> 3:08:48.120]  And so, Obama is a colossal hoax
[3:08:48.120 --> 3:08:50.120]  He's as big a hoax as man may global warming
[3:08:50.120 --> 3:08:52.120]  He's as big a hoax as W. M. D's
[3:08:52.120 --> 3:08:54.120]  In Iraqi
[3:08:54.120 --> 3:08:56.120]  This isn't about partisanship
[3:08:56.120 --> 3:08:58.120]  Left or right, it's about the truth
[3:08:58.120 --> 3:09:00.120]  And if you're a Socialist
[3:09:00.120 --> 3:09:02.120]  Who really wants
[3:09:02.120 --> 3:09:04.120]  Government Health Care
[3:09:06.120 --> 3:09:08.120]  You're a well-meaning liberal
[3:09:08.120 --> 3:09:10.120]  That wants to help people who don't have health care
[3:09:10.120 --> 3:09:14.120]  You have to be against this bill
[3:09:14.120 --> 3:09:19.400]  as Dennis Kucinich said, it is nothing but a corporate rip-off. It raises your taxes and cuts
[3:09:19.400 --> 3:09:26.280]  your benefits and it puts you in prison. I mean, it's so un-American, it makes my head spin so
[3:09:26.280 --> 3:09:32.200]  unconstitutional. Now, I'm against free healthcare because there's nothing that's free in this world
[3:09:32.200 --> 3:09:38.040]  and it gives government control over your life and any big government system turns into a rip-off
[3:09:38.040 --> 3:09:43.800]  because only big, powerful financial interest can come in and move the levers of government.
[3:09:43.800 --> 3:09:48.920]  So any big government is always going to burn you and is always going to be a fraud.
[3:09:48.920 --> 3:09:55.400]  That is the nature of it. It is like a law of gravity or the law of thermodynamics
[3:09:55.400 --> 3:10:02.760]  or the law of cause and effect. It is a law, not a theory. Big government is hell.
[3:10:04.120 --> 3:10:12.200]  People want solutions, cut government. Instead, Obama has spent more money than all presidents
[3:10:12.200 --> 3:10:18.840]  before him combined. Now, the buck doesn't stop with Obama. I told people in Obama deception
[3:10:18.840 --> 3:10:23.720]  and fall the republic, he will be politically destroyed and then everything will be blamed on
[3:10:23.720 --> 3:10:28.840]  him and then the next puppet will come in and everything will be blamed on that puppet. Please,
[3:10:28.840 --> 3:10:33.000]  ladies and gentlemen, look past the little puppets dancing in front of you to the person
[3:10:33.000 --> 3:10:42.440]  pulling the strings. Bernacke, Summers, Geithner, Reuben, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers,
[3:10:43.320 --> 3:10:49.320]  and finally the real elite is being revealed. Now, in Copenhagen,
[3:10:52.680 --> 3:10:58.200]  the meeting is in trouble because Africa, Asia and Latin America have discovered that its massive
[3:10:58.200 --> 3:11:03.080]  taxes paid directly to the IMF and World Bank from the third world and the first world, the
[3:11:03.080 --> 3:11:08.440]  developing and the developed, to be paid to the IMF and World Bank. The UN has no control,
[3:11:08.440 --> 3:11:13.240]  even if you trust the UN. It is going to the IMF and World Bank who are even worse
[3:11:13.960 --> 3:11:18.360]  if they are the progenitors of the UN. There is nothing but a holding front for them.
[3:11:18.360 --> 3:11:29.320]  George Soros is involved. Global taxes, global GDP taxes, global taxes with a global authority
[3:11:29.320 --> 3:11:35.800]  over all money transfers. That's what's in the treaty. Go to infowars.com. Go to prisonplanet.com.
[3:11:35.800 --> 3:11:41.400]  Go over the documents. Go over the latest treaty. Paul Watson has written an article about it.
[3:11:41.400 --> 3:11:49.400]  He has links to the treaty. Don't believe me. Read this for yourself. Then when you see Obama
[3:11:49.400 --> 3:11:56.360]  up there talking about how war is peace and how this is a great deal for the third world and how
[3:11:56.360 --> 3:12:03.800]  America is bad and has to pay its debt, that's meant to sell the left and America
[3:12:04.760 --> 3:12:09.800]  bashers on, oh, we're going to get behind this when it's actually genocide to their countries
[3:12:09.800 --> 3:12:14.520]  and is actually meant to target them and destroy the development of their industrial capacity.
[3:12:15.560 --> 3:12:22.840]  And as a death sentence, just the U.S. and Brazil shifting to 30% of their cornfields to ethanol,
[3:12:22.840 --> 3:12:27.320]  doubled world food prices and killed an extra 10 million people from starvation.
[3:12:27.320 --> 3:12:32.440]  Normally it's 15 million. It was 25 million. Those are conservative estimates. You think
[3:12:32.440 --> 3:12:38.520]  about 10 million people. I know Stalin said that one person is a tragedy, 10,000 is a statistic,
[3:12:38.520 --> 3:12:45.800]  but you wrap your mind around that. You let that sink in. Now, in this segment and the next few,
[3:12:45.800 --> 3:12:50.600]  I'm going to play Obama's speech today in Copenhagen, the final day of the official
[3:12:50.600 --> 3:12:55.880]  world government event. I mean, that's what Ban Ki-moon calls it. That's what von Rumpi calls it.
[3:12:55.880 --> 3:13:01.320]  The head of the EU, head of the UN, Schwarzenegger calls it that. David Rothschild calls it that.
[3:13:01.320 --> 3:13:07.800]  No more denial. Private world government. So I'm going to play Obama and briefly stop him
[3:13:07.800 --> 3:13:13.400]  and cover each lie. Here is Obama today in Copenhagen. Good morning.
[3:13:15.400 --> 3:13:21.160]  It is an honor for me to join this distinguished group of leaders from nations around the world.
[3:13:22.440 --> 3:13:29.800]  We come here in Copenhagen because climate change poses a grave and growing danger
[3:13:29.800 --> 3:13:37.800]  to our people. All of you would not be here unless you, like me, were convinced.
[3:13:39.640 --> 3:13:44.840]  Okay. Now, that's about 30 seconds of it. Let's go over the lies. He says,
[3:13:44.840 --> 3:13:49.880]  all of you leaders are here. You all agree that climate change is a grave and deadly
[3:13:49.880 --> 3:13:54.680]  threat and is really happening. That's a complete fraud. More than 50 of the delegates
[3:13:54.680 --> 3:14:01.000]  of the 190 plus that are there on record have said they are questioning climate gate and the
[3:14:01.000 --> 3:14:05.080]  official story and a bunch of world leaders from those countries are questioning it.
[3:14:05.640 --> 3:14:10.840]  And that's on record. You know, the president of the Czech Republic countless others, the Russians,
[3:14:10.840 --> 3:14:17.080]  you name it, the Japanese, the Chinese, the Indians, I mean, it goes on and on.
[3:14:17.640 --> 3:14:22.200]  So that's a lie. You're all here. You all agree and you all agree it's a grave danger.
[3:14:22.200 --> 3:14:26.040]  And notice it's not global warming now because things are getting colder.
[3:14:26.040 --> 3:14:31.880]  Naturally, it's global change. Change is not normal. The seasons are not normal.
[3:14:33.480 --> 3:14:41.080]  Okay. So let's continue. Unless you, like me, were convinced that this danger is real.
[3:14:42.760 --> 3:14:50.600]  This is not fiction. It is science. It pause. This is not fiction. It is science.
[3:14:50.600 --> 3:14:56.520]  When the main UN university in England that produced the key documents and the head
[3:14:56.520 --> 3:15:02.600]  scientist for the IPCC, Santor, separately from climate gate, now admits as of Wednesday on
[3:15:02.600 --> 3:15:08.520]  national U.S. television, this is huge news that he took out five areas of the report
[3:15:08.520 --> 3:15:15.000]  where the UN's own scientist said man is not causing this. The final report, they cut it out.
[3:15:15.000 --> 3:15:23.880]  Of course, man can't do anything near the sun or anything near the moon. And the title changes
[3:15:23.880 --> 3:15:30.200]  from the moon, the amount of gases exchanged by all of that water moving. I mean, that alone,
[3:15:30.200 --> 3:15:41.400]  the moon is unbelievable. But the sun dwarfs it. So it's just incredible. All of it is lies.
[3:15:41.400 --> 3:15:48.280]  Continue. Unchecked. Climate change will pose unacceptable risks to our security,
[3:15:49.240 --> 3:15:53.080]  our economies, and our planet. Good pause.
[3:15:57.880 --> 3:16:06.120]  Unacceptable risk. You have the UN caught fixing the data. This is the same thing when he talks
[3:16:06.120 --> 3:16:13.000]  about this is not a fiction. This is science. That's like Al Gore talking about how he invented
[3:16:13.000 --> 3:16:17.560]  the Internet. Total lie. Or Al Gore saying polar bears can't swim and are all dying
[3:16:17.560 --> 3:16:21.080]  when their numbers have more than tripled in the last 50 years. Official numbers.
[3:16:22.920 --> 3:16:30.040]  That's like Bill Clinton saying I did not have sex with that woman. Or Richard Nixon saying I'm
[3:16:30.040 --> 3:16:37.160]  not a crook or George Bush senior saying read my lips. It's a lie. It's a lie.
[3:16:39.720 --> 3:16:43.000]  So he's saying this is science. This is fact. You can't question
[3:16:44.920 --> 3:16:48.600]  when their scientists have been proven in premeditated fraud.
[3:16:49.640 --> 3:16:55.480]  Here's a guy saying pay taxes to a private global corporation, the World Bank and IMF,
[3:16:55.480 --> 3:17:00.600]  or the or the seas are going to rise and you're going to drown back to it. This much we know.
[3:17:03.480 --> 3:17:07.960]  The question then before us is no longer the nature of the challenge.
[3:17:09.480 --> 3:17:14.840]  The question is our capacity to meet it. Hit pause. See just keep saying everyone knows
[3:17:14.840 --> 3:17:20.280]  everyone knows it's not a question. It's a fact. We know the facts are in. You've got to do what I
[3:17:20.280 --> 3:17:27.240]  say. It's a fact. It's a fact. It's a fact. A total con man, just a slick Harvard lawyer con man
[3:17:27.960 --> 3:17:33.240]  running a scam on the dumb public. Well, the dumb public woke up to your scam, buddy. Let's go back
[3:17:33.240 --> 3:17:41.720]  to him for while. The reality of climate change is not in doubt. I have to be honest. There you go.
[3:17:41.720 --> 3:17:46.280]  Hit pause again. I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I'm trying to play this. We're not even two minutes
[3:17:46.280 --> 3:17:53.480]  into it. He says, while the reality of climate change is not in doubt, I guess in a lawyer speak,
[3:17:53.480 --> 3:18:00.360]  that's true. The climate is always changing. Just like on Mars, the ice caps were getting smaller
[3:18:00.360 --> 3:18:07.320]  the last 50 years. Suddenly the last five, they started getting bigger again because the sun just
[3:18:07.320 --> 3:18:12.440]  cooled off. That's why it's going to get colder here. I mean, it's not a conspiracy theory, folks,
[3:18:12.440 --> 3:18:17.720]  that if you stand in front of a fireplace, it heats your hands and that the sun heats up and
[3:18:17.720 --> 3:18:23.800]  cools off. It oscillates in cycles and 21 year cycles and 11 year cycles.
[3:18:26.200 --> 3:18:32.120]  I mean, ancients worship the sun because they knew it created the heat. The UN said on Monday,
[3:18:32.120 --> 3:18:37.000]  no, it's not the sun. The sun has no effect. That's associated press headline.
[3:18:37.000 --> 3:18:44.120]  That Google that UN says sun has no effect on climate. I mean, ladies and gentlemen, penguins can
[3:18:44.120 --> 3:18:49.640]  swim. Their numbers are up. Polar bears can swim. They hunt on the ice flows. They're not rounding.
[3:18:49.640 --> 3:18:54.840]  The sun is what mainly drives climate. I don't know how many climatologists and astrophysicists
[3:18:54.840 --> 3:18:59.400]  I've got to have on to explain that. But when somebody tells you the sun isn't involved in
[3:18:59.400 --> 3:19:07.480]  the temperature, ladies and gentlemen, this planet would be below zero and would be hundreds of
[3:19:07.480 --> 3:19:16.920]  degrees below zero in days if the sun went out. We would be as cold as Pluto. Pluto, I forget, is
[3:19:17.720 --> 3:19:21.800]  pull up the temperature of Pluto. It's something like thousands of degrees below zero.
[3:19:21.800 --> 3:19:30.040]  You know why? Because it's thousands of times further out from the sun than our planet is.
[3:19:31.400 --> 3:19:37.160]  Look at that. No sunlight to climate change, BBC. I just, how dumb do they think we are?
[3:19:37.720 --> 3:19:41.240]  I'm going to come back and try to go through this, but he said nobody's questioning.
[3:19:41.960 --> 3:19:47.160]  Nobody's, no one's questioning climate change. You heard it from him. That's another lie.
[3:19:47.160 --> 3:19:53.000]  31,000 scientists sent him a petition saying they wanted to talk to him. I mean...
[3:19:55.320 --> 3:20:01.560]  Attention, an important product from hempusa.org, micro plant powder, will change your life by
[3:20:01.560 --> 3:20:07.000]  removing all types of positive toxins such as heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses,
[3:20:07.000 --> 3:20:12.200]  and fungus from the digestive tract and stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients. Micro plant
[3:20:12.200 --> 3:20:17.960]  powder is 89% silica, and packed with a negative charge that attracts positive toxins from the
[3:20:17.960 --> 3:20:23.000]  blood, organs, spine, and brain. This product has the ability to rebuild cartilagin bone,
[3:20:23.000 --> 3:20:28.040]  which allows synovial fluid to return to the joints. Silica is a precursor to calcium,
[3:20:28.040 --> 3:20:33.160]  meaning the body turns silica into calcium and is great for the heart. There is no better time

[3:21:58.600 --> 3:22:03.320]  Increasing the money supply without increasing productive output leads to inflation. You get
[3:22:03.320 --> 3:22:07.560]  less for your money. If you want to protect the buying power of dollars for your future,
[3:22:07.560 --> 3:22:16.120]  then call Peter May at Mitis Resources, 800-686-2237, extension 135. You've worked hard for your

[3:23:57.320 --> 3:24:17.880]  Okay, let's continue with Obama. So he just said no one questions climate change. Another lie.
[3:24:17.880 --> 3:24:22.520]  I mean, you know that's a lie. Even if you believe polar bears can't swim, penguins can't swim,
[3:24:22.520 --> 3:24:27.080]  the sun doesn't warm the earth, has nothing to do with it. You just saw the UN say so.
[3:24:29.400 --> 3:24:34.680]  You could fry eggs outside on the cement in July in Texas, but nothing to do with the sun.
[3:24:34.680 --> 3:24:39.640]  That heat's coming up from a grill underneath the concrete. Okay, even if you believe that,
[3:24:40.760 --> 3:24:44.120]  you know scientists are questioning manmade global warming.
[3:24:45.080 --> 3:24:49.320]  You know that's a lie. Now let's go back to his lordship. Here's Obama at the UN.
[3:24:49.320 --> 3:24:56.120]  Change is not in doubt. I have to be honest, as the world watches us today,
[3:24:57.000 --> 3:25:05.080]  I think our ability to take collective action is in doubt right now, and it hangs in the balance.
[3:25:07.960 --> 3:25:14.280]  I believe we can act boldly and decisively in the face of a common threat.
[3:25:14.280 --> 3:25:20.920]  But that's why I come here today, not to talk, but to act.
[3:25:28.360 --> 3:25:36.600]  Now, as the world's largest economy and as the world's second largest emitter,
[3:25:36.600 --> 3:25:46.120]  America bears our responsibility. Okay, so now there's a bunch of America bashing.
[3:25:46.680 --> 3:25:52.120]  We're the second biggest polluter China's past this last year of putting out the most
[3:25:52.120 --> 3:25:57.640]  carbon dioxide. Let's not stop them from putting lead mercury and melamine in the baby milk and
[3:25:57.640 --> 3:26:03.000]  in the medicines and the foods and all the crud they ship over here. Let's not have China stop that.
[3:26:03.000 --> 3:26:07.080]  Let's have them stop putting out carbon dioxide. But wait, they don't have to make cuts under this
[3:26:07.080 --> 3:26:14.680]  agreement. Only we do. And so more of our industry will move there. But here he is,
[3:26:14.680 --> 3:26:19.960]  in front of the UN, in front of all these countries, bad-mouthing his own country. Back to Obama.
[3:26:21.160 --> 3:26:29.560]  America bears our responsibility to address climate change, and we intend to meet that
[3:26:29.560 --> 3:26:36.760]  responsibility. That's why we've renewed our leadership within international climate change
[3:26:36.760 --> 3:26:43.160]  negotiations. That's why we've worked with other nations to phase out fossil fuel subsidies.
[3:26:43.160 --> 3:26:49.720]  All right, hit pause. What that means is, hey, the U.S. is run by the private banks,
[3:26:49.720 --> 3:26:54.440]  and the U.S. has funded the world government. We've been sucked dry to fund this, and we're
[3:26:54.440 --> 3:26:59.960]  intensifying our funding to buy all you third-world countries off. And most of you presidents and
[3:26:59.960 --> 3:27:05.880]  prime ministers and parliament heads, you've all gotten giant cash payments from us to sell
[3:27:05.880 --> 3:27:12.440]  your people out. So you've been bought, so you deliver. You deliver cutting off the resources
[3:27:12.440 --> 3:27:17.400]  and fossil fuels to your millions of people, many of which are living on the edge of starvation,
[3:27:17.400 --> 3:27:22.040]  and millions of which do starve. You kill your people for the New World Order because that's
[3:27:22.040 --> 3:27:27.320]  what Dutch Royal Shell and the Queen of England and David Rockefeller want. That's the translation
[3:27:27.320 --> 3:27:33.560]  there. Back to Obama. That's why we've taken bold action at home by making historic investments
[3:27:33.560 --> 3:27:39.880]  in renewable energy, by putting our people to work increasing efficiency in our homes and
[3:27:39.880 --> 3:27:45.640]  bodies. Hit pause. More lies. They always candy-coat their global taxation grid in electric cars,
[3:27:45.640 --> 3:27:49.640]  windmills, things that sound reasonable. But really, even those are boondoggles given to
[3:27:49.640 --> 3:27:53.800]  their select friends and buddies as payoffs. That's coming out in the news. So that's an
[3:27:53.800 --> 3:27:59.960]  inside scam. And then they use all that fake environmentalism to block out real environmental
[3:27:59.960 --> 3:28:04.680]  action, real environmental controls like genetic engineering and things that are truly dangerous,
[3:28:04.680 --> 3:28:10.920]  nanotech, CERN reactors, superconducting supercolliders. A lot of these super advanced
[3:28:10.920 --> 3:28:16.280]  technologies, the Pentagon admits they're messing around with antimatter. That's in the San Francisco
[3:28:16.280 --> 3:28:23.480]  Chronicle. Oh, let's not have any real controls on stuff that really is dangerous. Let's just,
[3:28:23.480 --> 3:28:27.800]  hey, you're for the future. You're for renewable energy. You know, you care, don't you? We're
[3:28:27.800 --> 3:28:31.800]  going to go out to break with Obama. I'm going to come back and comment on what he had to say
[3:28:31.800 --> 3:28:37.880]  and finish up on the other side. Stay with us. Back to Obama. By pursuing comprehensive legislation
[3:28:37.880 --> 3:28:45.960]  to transform to a clean energy economy, these mitigation actions are ambitious and we are
[3:28:46.680 --> 3:28:54.280]  taking them not simply to meet global responsibilities. We are convinced, as some of you may be convinced,
[3:28:55.480 --> 3:29:02.840]  that changing the way we produce and use energy is essential to America's economic future,
[3:29:02.840 --> 3:29:09.080]  that it will create millions of new jobs, power new industries, keep us competitive,
[3:29:09.960 --> 3:29:18.120]  and spark new innovation. We're convinced, for our own self-interest, that the way we use energy,
[3:29:18.120 --> 3:29:25.000]  changing it to a more efficient fashion, is essential to our national security because it helps
[3:29:25.720 --> 3:29:32.520]  to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and helps us deal with some of the dangers posed
[3:29:32.520 --> 3:29:39.880]  by climate change. So I want this plenary session to understand America is going to continue on this
[3:29:39.880 --> 3:29:51.880]  course of action. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:29:54.360 --> 3:29:58.920]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[3:29:58.920 --> 3:30:04.120]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two,
[3:30:04.120 --> 3:30:09.000]  our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[3:30:09.000 --> 3:30:14.680]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:30:14.680 --> 3:30:19.640]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[3:30:19.640 --> 3:30:25.080]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always
[3:30:25.080 --> 3:30:29.560]  a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related
[3:30:29.560 --> 3:30:34.680]  onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[3:30:34.680 --> 3:30:38.760]  mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[3:30:38.760 --> 3:30:44.680]  one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's
[3:30:44.680 --> 3:30:50.280]  mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com
[3:30:50.280 --> 3:30:58.520]  or call 1-877-327-0365. Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the
[3:30:58.520 --> 3:31:03.880]  Silver Lungs Generator. Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[3:31:03.880 --> 3:31:08.200]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[3:31:08.840 --> 3:31:13.480]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[3:31:13.480 --> 3:31:18.200]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced
[3:31:18.200 --> 3:31:24.920]  nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[3:31:24.920 --> 3:31:29.000]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products,
[3:31:29.000 --> 3:31:34.840]  you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator. Very
[3:31:34.840 --> 3:31:39.880]  easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[3:31:39.880 --> 3:31:46.280]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver
[3:31:46.280 --> 3:31:50.280]  Lungs Generator. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[3:31:55.320 --> 3:31:59.320]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:31:59.320 --> 3:32:02.520]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:32:02.520 --> 3:32:07.720]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[3:32:07.720 --> 3:32:13.720]  I have tremendous influence on our president and congress and they really are calling the shots.
[3:32:13.720 --> 3:32:19.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:32:19.000 --> 3:32:24.440]  Fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal off-short cartel
[3:32:24.440 --> 3:32:29.080]  hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:32:29.080 --> 3:32:34.200]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the congress is saying
[3:32:34.200 --> 3:32:38.840]  who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington,
[3:32:38.840 --> 3:32:45.880]  D.C. we have seen a fall of the republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD
[3:32:45.880 --> 3:32:52.680]  at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:33:00.040 --> 3:33:07.560]  So now Obama, word for word says what Lord Christopher Monkton yesterday on this radio
[3:33:07.560 --> 3:33:13.720]  show said he would say. Word for word. When I watched this live early this morning, my mouth
[3:33:13.720 --> 3:33:19.880]  was hanging open. I mean, word for word. We must do this. It's a historic global agreement. You're
[3:33:19.880 --> 3:33:24.840]  part of this. Your children are watching. You've got to do this. We've had all these years of
[3:33:24.840 --> 3:33:30.120]  inaction, which isn't true. They're taking over the counties and cities through the bureaucracies
[3:33:30.120 --> 3:33:36.680]  of all the nations, including the United States especially, all the different subregions depending
[3:33:36.680 --> 3:33:42.040]  on how governments break that down in their federal systems. They aren't already implementing all this.
[3:33:42.040 --> 3:33:45.960]  You know about all the green taxes you're already paying. None of us green. It's a robbery.
[3:33:46.840 --> 3:33:52.040]  So let's go back to Obama as he says, we've got to do this. It's historical.
[3:33:53.560 --> 3:33:58.040]  And then he goes on to say, even if you don't sign on, the U.S. is going to fund this.
[3:33:58.680 --> 3:34:04.680]  And that will just be private money to the IMF to go into round two of paying off other countries
[3:34:04.680 --> 3:34:09.960]  that they've already got under debt. This is their new way to get even more debt and more control.
[3:34:09.960 --> 3:34:15.480]  Here's Obama. To mitigate our emissions and to move towards a clean energy economy,
[3:34:16.920 --> 3:34:24.520]  no matter what happens here in Copenhagen, we think it is good for us as well as good
[3:34:24.520 --> 3:34:32.760]  for the world. But we also believe that we will all be stronger, all be safer, all be more secure
[3:34:32.760 --> 3:34:38.360]  if we act together. Good pause. So there you have it. They're going to make the climate cuts here,
[3:34:38.360 --> 3:34:43.400]  which is even better for them in phase one, just like the big famous steel mill that just closed
[3:34:43.400 --> 3:34:48.920]  in England. The government paid a millions of pounds, millions of U.S. dollars to shut down
[3:34:48.920 --> 3:34:55.400]  and move to India with no emissions controls. That's environmentalism. So even if you believe
[3:34:55.400 --> 3:34:59.960]  that polar bears can't swim and that carbon dioxide that plants breathe is a deadly poison,
[3:34:59.960 --> 3:35:03.320]  then this is going to produce more of that deadly poison. Here it is.
[3:35:04.280 --> 3:35:10.280]  That's why it is in our mutual interest to achieve a global accord in which we agree
[3:35:10.280 --> 3:35:15.000]  to certain steps and to hold each other accountable to certain commitments.
[3:35:18.920 --> 3:35:27.400]  After months of talk, after two weeks of negotiations, after innumerable
[3:35:27.400 --> 3:35:35.720]  side meetings, bilateral meetings, endless hours of discussion among negotiators,
[3:35:37.000 --> 3:35:46.520]  I believe that the pieces of that accord should now be clear. First, all major economies must put
[3:35:46.520 --> 3:35:53.080]  forward decisive national actions that will reduce their emissions and begin to turn the
[3:35:53.080 --> 3:36:00.040]  corner on climate change. All right, hit pause. Even if you believe that UN zone cook numbers,
[3:36:00.040 --> 3:36:05.000]  all of our evil carbon dioxide may increase the temperature by one degree
[3:36:06.680 --> 3:36:11.560]  and may make the seas rise between seven and 20 inches, nothing. And that's been proven to be a
[3:36:11.560 --> 3:36:16.920]  fraud. The seas are actually slightly dropping right now and you can just go to any major coastal
[3:36:16.920 --> 3:36:25.160]  relay center online and read their 10-year numbers on the level. Last five years, San Francisco's
[3:36:25.160 --> 3:36:28.520]  water level has gone down by a few inches on average, but it goes up and down.
[3:36:30.120 --> 3:36:37.160]  The point here is that he's saying we've got to have these global emissions controls. All
[3:36:37.160 --> 3:36:43.400]  nations must implement this under this international agreement. And then now we have the agreement.
[3:36:43.400 --> 3:36:50.840]  It's a tax on all financial transactions and a global authority over travel. This is a control grid.
[3:36:52.680 --> 3:36:56.680]  Back to Obama. I'm pleased that many of us have already done so.
[3:36:59.320 --> 3:37:05.560]  Almost all the major economies have put forward legitimate targets, significant targets, ambitious
[3:37:05.560 --> 3:37:10.840]  targets. And I'm confident that America will fulfill the commitments that we have made,
[3:37:10.840 --> 3:37:19.000]  cutting our emissions in the range of 17% by 2020 and by more than 80% by 2050 in line with final
[3:37:19.000 --> 3:37:28.760]  legislation. Second, we must have a mechanism to review whether we are keeping our commitments
[3:37:28.760 --> 3:37:31.880]  and exchange this information in a transparent manner.
[3:37:31.880 --> 3:37:37.800]  Hit pause. That's the global government. Just like they attack your country if you try to build
[3:37:37.800 --> 3:37:43.480]  your own nuclear reactors or if you try to have your own central bank, they will attack you
[3:37:43.480 --> 3:37:49.480]  over your carbon emissions. They will put sanctions on you. And then, yes, physically attack you.
[3:37:50.520 --> 3:37:55.480]  Physically attack you. That's what this global government is. That's why it says global governance
[3:37:55.480 --> 3:37:59.320]  in these treaties. I have the treaty right here. Framework convention on climate change,
[3:37:59.320 --> 3:38:02.360]  global governance, as they've stated. Back to him.
[3:38:02.360 --> 3:38:09.640]  These measures need not be intrusive or infringe upon sovereignty. They must, however,
[3:38:09.640 --> 3:38:15.000]  ensure that an accord is credible and that we're living up to our mutual obligations.
[3:38:16.200 --> 3:38:21.400]  Without such accountability, any agreement would be empty words on the page.
[3:38:23.080 --> 3:38:27.080]  I don't know how you have an international agreement where we all
[3:38:27.080 --> 3:38:32.200]  are not sharing information and ensuring that we are meeting our commitments.
[3:38:32.200 --> 3:38:38.280]  Hit pause. And that was a satellite blip from recording it, a TV blip from Denmark.
[3:38:38.280 --> 3:38:41.400]  We didn't edit anything when you can read the transcript for yourself.
[3:38:41.400 --> 3:38:46.760]  And there he's saying you've got to have a global institution to enforce this agreement. Back to it.
[3:38:50.040 --> 3:38:54.360]  That doesn't make sense. It would be a hollow victory.
[3:38:54.360 --> 3:39:02.520]  Number three, we must have financing that helps developing countries adapt,
[3:39:03.240 --> 3:39:11.480]  particularly the least developed and most vulnerable to climate change. America will be
[3:39:11.480 --> 3:39:18.520]  a part of a fast start funding that will ramp up to $10 billion by 2012.
[3:39:18.520 --> 3:39:25.720]  Okay, stop right there. They say they're going to help the third world.
[3:39:26.440 --> 3:39:31.000]  All these are IMF World Bank loans backed up with Western tax money.
[3:39:31.000 --> 3:39:37.080]  And the loans are given, this was going on in 73 under State Department of Random 200,
[3:39:37.080 --> 3:39:42.600]  where Kissinger's talking about we give them loans to sterilize their women and to cut off food.
[3:39:42.600 --> 3:39:48.360]  And in the future, you won't get loans unless you cut the amount of food you eat.
[3:39:49.400 --> 3:39:54.920]  This is eugenics. This is population reduction. Let's go back to the video.
[3:39:56.920 --> 3:40:01.960]  Hillary Clinton, my secretary of state, made it clear that we will engage in a global effort
[3:40:01.960 --> 3:40:12.120]  to mobilize $100 billion in financing by 2020 if and only if it is part of a broader
[3:40:12.120 --> 3:40:18.840]  accord that I've just described. All right, pause again. What he's saying there is,
[3:40:18.840 --> 3:40:24.760]  I'll give $100 billion of the third world, we'll do it in 2020, 10 years after we're taxing you for
[3:40:24.760 --> 3:40:34.040]  carbon. Do you understand what that means? All right, let's go ahead now and go back to the clip.
[3:40:34.040 --> 3:40:48.280]  Mitigation, transparency, financing. It's a clear formula, one that embraces the principle of common
[3:40:48.280 --> 3:40:56.040]  but differentiated responses and respective capabilities. And it adds up to a significant
[3:40:56.040 --> 3:41:04.760]  accord, one that takes us farther than we have ever gone before as an international community.
[3:41:05.000 --> 3:41:11.560]  I just want to say to this plenary session that we are running short on time.
[3:41:13.880 --> 3:41:19.400]  And at this point, the question is whether we will move forward together or split apart,
[3:41:19.400 --> 3:41:29.960]  whether we prefer posturing to action. I'm sure that many consider this an imperfect
[3:41:31.160 --> 3:41:38.280]  framework that I just described. No country will agree that it wants. There are those
[3:41:38.280 --> 3:41:47.160]  developing countries that want aid with no strings attached and no obligations with respect to
[3:41:47.160 --> 3:41:53.880]  transparency. They think that the most advanced nations should pay a higher price. I understand
[3:41:53.880 --> 3:41:59.000]  that. There are those advanced nations who think that developing countries... Okay, that's another
[3:41:59.000 --> 3:42:06.360]  lie. We've got the Copenhagen Treaty. They're upset because they were told they didn't have
[3:42:06.360 --> 3:42:10.920]  to make cuts and the first world did, that they were going to get tax money. Now they learn they
[3:42:10.920 --> 3:42:16.600]  have to make cuts almost double. It's not quite double, almost double what the West has to make
[3:42:16.600 --> 3:42:20.840]  and that the IMF and World Bank will be collecting all this money and keeping it for themselves,
[3:42:20.840 --> 3:42:23.560]  and the third world knows how corrupt those institutions are.
[3:42:25.720 --> 3:42:30.280]  So here he is, like he's the arbiter between the first world and the third world and the
[3:42:30.280 --> 3:42:35.720]  developing world. You know, he's the arbiter when he clearly is a representative of the
[3:42:35.720 --> 3:42:40.520]  Anglo-American New World Order. Let's go back to him. For those advanced nations who think that
[3:42:40.520 --> 3:42:47.080]  developing countries either cannot absorb this assistance or that will not be held accountable
[3:42:47.080 --> 3:42:52.440]  effectively and that the world's fastest growing emitters should bear a greater share of the burden.
[3:42:54.520 --> 3:43:00.920]  We know the fault lines because we've been imprisoned by them for years.
[3:43:00.920 --> 3:43:12.440]  Good plus. Energy, cheap energy has allowed humans to grow and has lifted a lot of people out of
[3:43:12.440 --> 3:43:18.280]  poverty. He's now saying cutting people's energy off is cutting their bondage off.
[3:43:19.400 --> 3:43:24.040]  Meanwhile, governments actually try to block real technological development and in this treaty,
[3:43:24.040 --> 3:43:28.440]  it says the UN will decide what new technologies can be funded and developed.
[3:43:28.440 --> 3:43:32.120]  So it's also a new dark age. Let's go back to it.
[3:43:35.000 --> 3:43:39.960]  These international discussions have essentially taken place now for almost two decades.
[3:43:42.280 --> 3:43:47.800]  And we have very little other than an increase in acceleration
[3:43:50.760 --> 3:43:53.000]  of the climate change phenomena.
[3:43:53.000 --> 3:44:00.600]  The time for talk is over. This is the bottom line.
[3:44:02.680 --> 3:44:06.920]  The time for talk is over. You're not allowed to talk. You're not allowed to debate.
[3:44:08.280 --> 3:44:12.600]  Everyone agrees the earth is dying from CO2, but everyone doesn't agree.
[3:44:13.400 --> 3:44:16.280]  So if everybody agrees, why is the time for talk over?
[3:44:17.000 --> 3:44:20.920]  See, we have to hurry and do this right now, finishing up with Obama.
[3:44:20.920 --> 3:44:28.120]  This is the bottom line. We can embrace this accord, take a substantial step forward,
[3:44:28.920 --> 3:44:32.680]  continue to refine it and build upon its foundation.
[3:44:34.120 --> 3:44:38.120]  We can do that and everyone who is in this room will be part of a historic endeavor,
[3:44:38.760 --> 3:44:41.880]  one that makes life better for our children and our grandchildren.
[3:44:44.040 --> 3:44:47.400]  Or we can choose delay.
[3:44:47.400 --> 3:44:53.640]  There you go. Hit pause. And then that's just two-year-old level psychology.
[3:44:53.640 --> 3:44:57.240]  You don't care about your children and grandchildren if you don't give in to this.
[3:44:57.800 --> 3:45:00.840]  When in truth, cutting off the fossil fuels of the third world,
[3:45:01.400 --> 3:45:05.000]  in their own club of Rome documents, the State Department of Moranum 200
[3:45:05.000 --> 3:45:08.600]  is meant to kill people en masse by starvation,
[3:45:08.600 --> 3:45:11.560]  which is how Mao Zedong did it and how Stalin did it.
[3:45:11.560 --> 3:45:16.120]  This is a death sentence and Obama knows full well what he's doing.
[3:45:16.120 --> 3:45:20.920]  That's why he's the brown face on this, hoping to sucker the third world
[3:45:20.920 --> 3:45:22.600]  into their own death sentence.
[3:45:22.600 --> 3:45:25.400]  That's why he was put in power was to sell this.
[3:45:25.400 --> 3:45:30.120]  That's why he was given the Nobel Peace Prize to sell war, that war is peace.
[3:45:30.120 --> 3:45:31.480]  Back to the fraud.
[3:45:31.480 --> 3:45:36.280]  Falling back into the same divisions that have stood in the way of action for years.
[3:45:37.320 --> 3:45:43.960]  And we will be back having the same stale arguments month after month, year after year,
[3:45:43.960 --> 3:45:50.440]  year after year, perhaps decade after decade, all while the danger of climate change grows
[3:45:51.000 --> 3:45:52.680]  until it is irreversible.
[3:45:57.640 --> 3:45:59.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's no time to waste.
[3:46:01.080 --> 3:46:02.360]  America's made our choice.
[3:46:03.320 --> 3:46:05.000]  We have charted our course.
[3:46:05.000 --> 3:46:06.520]  We have made our commitments.
[3:46:06.520 --> 3:46:07.720]  We will do what we say.
[3:46:09.240 --> 3:46:12.440]  Now I believe it's the time for the nations and the people of the world
[3:46:12.440 --> 3:46:15.800]  to come together behind a kind of force.
[3:46:15.800 --> 3:46:16.600]  Stop right there.
[3:46:17.480 --> 3:46:23.320]  That's why Obama has told the Senate and the House, I don't care if this doesn't get ratified.
[3:46:24.280 --> 3:46:27.080]  I'm going to implement this by command and control.
[3:46:27.080 --> 3:46:28.760]  Remember that on Monday from the White House?
[3:46:29.880 --> 3:46:31.320]  Totally unconstitutional.
[3:46:31.320 --> 3:46:34.680]  He's not a dictator, but that's why he said that.
[3:46:35.240 --> 3:46:40.280]  Obama said that because he's been given his orders.
[3:46:40.280 --> 3:46:44.360]  The die is set, the U.S. has to be the sacrificial lamb.
[3:46:44.360 --> 3:46:48.520]  China, India, Mexico, and 100 plus other third world countries,
[3:46:48.520 --> 3:46:49.960]  they're not going to make any cuts.
[3:46:50.680 --> 3:46:55.640]  The U.S. is going to sign on to the agreement, Europe's going to sign on,
[3:46:55.640 --> 3:47:00.440]  and we're going to have our taxes raised to give more money to the IMF and World Bank
[3:47:00.440 --> 3:47:03.640]  to go buy off the third world, the third world leaders,
[3:47:03.640 --> 3:47:05.560]  to murder their people by starvation.
[3:47:06.120 --> 3:47:06.680]  Real simple.
[3:47:06.680 --> 3:47:11.320]  And that's what's covered in eco science, written by the White House, science are.
[3:47:13.400 --> 3:47:14.280]  That's their plan.
[3:47:15.160 --> 3:47:16.600]  They want to get rid of people.
[3:47:16.600 --> 3:47:19.320]  And there's a lot of you out there that think it's the received knowledge
[3:47:19.320 --> 3:47:22.680]  that we've got a reduced world population and that it's the right thing to do.
[3:47:24.040 --> 3:47:26.120]  Well, you go ahead and kill yourselves then.
[3:47:26.120 --> 3:47:30.120]  Do not sit there and have a death sentence to these little African children
[3:47:30.120 --> 3:47:31.960]  and Latin Americans and Asians and others,
[3:47:31.960 --> 3:47:38.280]  and then see American standard of living dropped. There's tens of millions of Americans
[3:47:38.280 --> 3:47:39.720]  on subsistence right now.
[3:47:39.720 --> 3:47:43.480]  There's people that freeze the death every year in this country having their power turned off.
[3:47:45.240 --> 3:47:50.600]  This is genocide for all of you people that have been sold on this being cutesy and cute
[3:47:50.600 --> 3:47:51.800]  by the corporate media.
[3:47:51.800 --> 3:47:53.560]  You know the corporate media's death.
[3:47:54.120 --> 3:47:56.200]  What are you doing being sold by this?
[3:47:57.160 --> 3:47:57.720]  Wake up.
[3:47:57.720 --> 3:47:59.240]  Stop being schmucks.
[3:47:59.240 --> 3:48:00.440]  Stop being fools.
[3:48:00.440 --> 3:48:01.880]  Stop being idiots.
[3:48:01.880 --> 3:48:04.200]  Let's finish up with Obama and I'm skipping this break.
[3:48:04.200 --> 3:48:05.240]  We're going to Robert Wannick.
[3:48:05.240 --> 3:48:05.720]  Go ahead.
[3:48:06.840 --> 3:48:09.400]  We are ready to get this done today.
[3:48:10.280 --> 3:48:11.880]  We're ready to gut America right now.
[3:48:11.880 --> 3:48:19.640]  There has to be movement on all sides to recognize that it is better for us to act than to talk.
[3:48:21.640 --> 3:48:24.120]  It's better for us to choose action over inaction.
[3:48:24.920 --> 3:48:26.360]  The future over the past.
[3:48:27.160 --> 3:48:27.720]  See.
[3:48:27.720 --> 3:48:29.160]  With courage and faith.
[3:48:29.160 --> 3:48:32.680]  The third world knows this is going to kill millions of people a year.
[3:48:33.320 --> 3:48:35.640]  And people tend to hesitate for they commit mass murder.
[3:48:35.640 --> 3:48:36.360]  Thank you very much.
[3:48:38.520 --> 3:48:40.280]  I mean what a load of bull.
[3:48:40.280 --> 3:48:44.840]  So that's my breakdown of his 10 minute 40 minute 40 second speech.
[3:48:47.080 --> 3:48:51.640]  And it just I could talk for 10 hours about what he's discussing.
[3:48:51.640 --> 3:48:57.000]  I spend an hour on each minute going through showing the evidence of how it's all frauds.
[3:48:57.000 --> 3:49:02.120]  But why should I have to show evidence when they say the sun doesn't affect temperature on the earth.
[3:49:02.120 --> 3:49:05.640]  When they say penguins and polar bears can't swim and are all drowning.
[3:49:06.360 --> 3:49:11.240]  Or when they say the ice caps would be gone by this year three years ago and they're getting bigger.
[3:49:12.040 --> 3:49:14.920]  Or when they say any climate change is abnormal.
[3:49:14.920 --> 3:49:20.120]  It's nothing but scaremongering to accept world government run by a private banking system.
[3:49:20.120 --> 3:49:20.440]  All right.
[3:49:20.440 --> 3:49:21.400]  I'm done ranting.
[3:49:21.400 --> 3:49:24.200]  We only got 10 minutes with Robert Wannick who's been persecuted.
[3:49:24.200 --> 3:49:30.520]  We will be rolling video in the background without audio of his YouTube video where he describes this.
[3:49:31.560 --> 3:49:35.320]  Robert Wannick great 9 11 truth activists great patriot.
[3:49:36.520 --> 3:49:38.920]  He is in high school.
[3:49:40.360 --> 3:49:43.880]  And he's won one of our postering contest before.
[3:49:44.520 --> 3:49:49.880]  And this time he got expelled for handing out the actual inserts.
[3:49:51.400 --> 3:49:53.480]  That show you what's really in the flu vaccine.
[3:49:53.480 --> 3:49:58.680]  They admit there's mercury and cause Guillain beret brain damage neurological disorders cancer.
[3:49:58.680 --> 3:50:00.360]  They don't want that being handed out.
[3:50:00.360 --> 3:50:04.920]  So he's trying to warn fellow students in his off time at school.
[3:50:04.920 --> 3:50:06.200]  And this is what happened to him.
[3:50:06.200 --> 3:50:10.280]  Robert Wannick tell us again where you're hailing from and exactly what happened to you.
[3:50:10.840 --> 3:50:12.600]  Well thanks for bringing me on today Alex.
[3:50:12.600 --> 3:50:16.440]  Um I attend school in Breckenridge Minnesota.
[3:50:16.440 --> 3:50:22.680]  I attend Breckenridge high school and every Wednesday we have a group meeting of classes
[3:50:22.680 --> 3:50:23.480]  called Connection.
[3:50:24.520 --> 3:50:30.840]  On last Wednesday we were given forms to receive our H1N1 vaccine on Wednesday the 16th.
[3:50:31.480 --> 3:50:34.680]  I decided to be a great idea if I'd fill out one of these forms
[3:50:34.680 --> 3:50:38.360]  and attend the clinic to educate others of the possible risk.
[3:50:39.000 --> 3:50:43.960]  Which a school should actually promote self education of students.
[3:50:44.600 --> 3:50:45.720]  No you're a prisoner.
[3:50:45.720 --> 3:50:46.760]  You're not allowed to do that.
[3:50:46.760 --> 3:50:48.600]  You're to keep your mouth shut.
[3:50:48.600 --> 3:50:53.240]  And only in supermaxes are you not allowed to talk to the other prisoners.
[3:50:53.240 --> 3:50:55.080]  So you're in a supermax.
[3:50:55.080 --> 3:50:56.120]  Exactly what's happening.
[3:50:56.680 --> 3:51:02.360]  So first step that was taken was my principal called my mom and asked her if she had
[3:51:02.360 --> 3:51:07.240]  signed this H1N1 form knowing that I'm anti-vaccine.
[3:51:07.240 --> 3:51:15.480]  She said yes because she supports the education of other students who may not be aware of the risk.
[3:51:15.480 --> 3:51:20.520]  So they were already watching you and didn't know why you were agreeing to do it.
[3:51:21.160 --> 3:51:23.960]  Exactly they were they were calling my parents.
[3:51:23.960 --> 3:51:27.800]  Well that's what Wharton's do you know he's doing his job as a Wharton go ahead.
[3:51:28.360 --> 3:51:36.200]  And so the 16th came this Wednesday and they were calling the juniors down to the science room
[3:51:36.200 --> 3:51:38.680]  to get vaccines from Wilkins County Public Health.
[3:51:39.320 --> 3:51:40.600]  They called my name.
[3:51:40.600 --> 3:51:47.240]  I went down there with about three file folders of information that simply had the
[3:51:47.240 --> 3:51:50.840]  insert of the H1N1 vaccine the Noveritas vaccine.
[3:51:50.840 --> 3:51:55.320]  Yeah you're like somebody in Tuskegee Alabama going and warning blacks not to be injected
[3:51:55.320 --> 3:51:55.960]  with syphilis.
[3:51:55.960 --> 3:51:59.000]  So you're a serious thought criminal.
[3:51:59.000 --> 3:52:02.920]  You're going to talk to people who are about to have a medical experiment done on them.
[3:52:04.280 --> 3:52:04.920]  Absolutely.
[3:52:04.920 --> 3:52:09.080]  So my principal was at the door and he said Robert you can go sit down.
[3:52:09.080 --> 3:52:13.160]  So I went and sat down next to a nurse as soon as she told me to roll up my sleeve.
[3:52:13.160 --> 3:52:18.600]  I stood up and said attention I just want to hand out some information about vaccine risk.
[3:52:19.320 --> 3:52:24.120]  I only got a few flyers up before my principal came up rammed his hand into my lower back and
[3:52:24.120 --> 3:52:26.600]  started forcing me towards the door.
[3:52:26.600 --> 3:52:28.440]  I said don't touch me I'm leaving.
[3:52:28.440 --> 3:52:30.040]  He said I'm just escorting you out.
[3:52:30.600 --> 3:52:33.320]  He I was out of the room within 30 seconds.
[3:52:33.320 --> 3:52:39.880]  But I decided that I couldn't go back to class yet if these kids had no clue what they were
[3:52:39.880 --> 3:52:40.760]  putting in their bodies.
[3:52:40.760 --> 3:52:43.000]  So I decided to address the line.
[3:52:43.560 --> 3:52:49.240]  So I handed out about 30 flyers one to each kid in line except for the science teacher's son
[3:52:49.240 --> 3:52:53.400]  who refused one and many of them started dispersing and leaving the line.
[3:52:53.960 --> 3:52:59.240]  Others just said you know I have a choice and I mean this is real rebellion against tyranny
[3:52:59.240 --> 3:53:04.760]  but the science teacher kid I'm a scientist I don't look at what's in the vaccine.
[3:53:06.600 --> 3:53:08.920]  I trust my Soviet government go ahead.
[3:53:09.800 --> 3:53:13.720]  Yeah and so these students started leaving and moments later I heard a student from
[3:53:13.720 --> 3:53:16.360]  inside the vaccine rooms say I have a choice.
[3:53:16.360 --> 3:53:17.640]  I don't want it anymore.
[3:53:17.640 --> 3:53:18.920]  I'm not going to get it.
[3:53:18.920 --> 3:53:22.280]  So they didn't even know they had a choice because all over the country it's come out.
[3:53:22.280 --> 3:53:26.760]  They are forcibly inoculating mainly elementary students because they don't know.
[3:53:26.760 --> 3:53:31.880]  And the funny part about it was the nurse actually tried to almost tell him that it was
[3:53:32.680 --> 3:53:33.480]  it was mandatory.
[3:53:33.480 --> 3:53:34.280]  Excuse me.
[3:53:34.280 --> 3:53:34.760]  Excuse me.
[3:53:34.760 --> 3:53:35.480]  What did you hear?
[3:53:35.960 --> 3:53:37.720]  I heard him say I don't want it.
[3:53:37.720 --> 3:53:41.240]  I'm not going to take it and she said your parents signed a form you have to take it and
[3:53:41.240 --> 3:53:46.520]  he said I'm not taking it and he walked out of the room and all you heard was the public
[3:53:46.520 --> 3:53:49.800]  health officials trying to lobby his opinion to keep him in there saying that.
[3:53:49.800 --> 3:53:51.160]  But see that's how this works.
[3:53:51.160 --> 3:53:55.960]  One person says no and half the people in the line go yeah I don't want it either.
[3:53:55.960 --> 3:54:01.320]  They were just intimidated under the group psychology the mob psychology to do it.
[3:54:02.520 --> 3:54:08.760]  And and then once once these students started walking in with these with these printed off
[3:54:08.760 --> 3:54:14.440]  flyers they started asking questions like have you guys heard of this and the nurses the nurses
[3:54:14.440 --> 3:54:18.840]  either want to take the flyers or get these vaccines done as quick as they could because
[3:54:18.840 --> 3:54:23.400]  every single student walked in with one that's when my principal emerged in the hallway with a
[3:54:23.400 --> 3:54:28.360]  law enforcement officer and said go back to class Robert he yelled at me down the hallway or I'll
[3:54:28.360 --> 3:54:35.640]  have you rested and removed from school grounds and I said I know the policy you can't just override
[3:54:35.640 --> 3:54:41.080]  the policy the policy for being out of class is a detention and I was more than willing to
[3:54:41.080 --> 3:54:48.520]  take a detention to get these flyers out and then after that I decided I go back to class
[3:54:48.520 --> 3:54:54.200]  because I knew that they would ramp up the punishment but at 1 30 is when my class ended
[3:54:54.200 --> 3:54:58.360]  and they announced any teachers or faculty that want the vaccine please report to the science
[3:54:58.360 --> 3:55:03.960]  room so the bell rang and me and about five other students who are educated on the issue of
[3:55:03.960 --> 3:55:08.440]  vaccination sprinted down to the science room so you came back with cavalry I bet they didn't
[3:55:08.440 --> 3:55:15.080]  like that now you're trying to warn the adults of the mercury and the cancer viruses I this time
[3:55:15.080 --> 3:55:20.840]  I came back with Pritzoff articles of the 14 year old student from from Virginia who got
[3:55:20.840 --> 3:55:27.560]  Guillain beret syndrome and I and I started telling people about how how the wilkin county public
[3:55:27.560 --> 3:55:32.680]  health form the kids were given said there's no link to gbs and this started raising eyebrows
[3:55:32.680 --> 3:55:38.840]  because I had I had an article that directly links the swine flu to gbs but the public health
[3:55:38.840 --> 3:55:44.360]  official was not about to let me in she actually pushed me as I was going in the door and then
[3:55:44.360 --> 3:55:49.640]  put one hand on each side of the door and said you're not coming through so I could not get in
[3:55:49.640 --> 3:55:55.480]  but what I did was I ducked and slid under her arm into the vaccine room where the where some
[3:55:55.480 --> 3:56:01.400]  teachers were already were already being vaccinated I handed out about three or four flyers and the
[3:56:01.400 --> 3:56:08.360]  science teacher comes up to me and I said just let me handle flyers I'm you can get your vaccine
[3:56:08.360 --> 3:56:14.040]  I just want to handle flyers and then I'll leave he grabs me both hands by the shirt and says get
[3:56:14.040 --> 3:56:20.600]  out and right now I had I had a student with a camera just for protection in case I would get
[3:56:21.320 --> 3:56:26.920]  assaulted and he goes puts his hands out and says I'm not assaulting you and proceeds to
[3:56:26.920 --> 3:56:32.440]  ram me with his chest to make it look like he's not assaulting me and he rams me out the door
[3:56:33.240 --> 3:56:38.040]  and he notices that there's a student out there that has a camera he doesn't know if the camera's
[3:56:38.040 --> 3:56:42.680]  filming or not filming but this obviously upsets him because he just he just broke the law he just
[3:56:42.680 --> 3:56:47.240]  put his hands on a minor he goes to grab the camera and the student does a handoff to me
[3:56:49.160 --> 3:56:53.240]  I start walking down the hallway with the camera and it takes him a while but he notices
[3:56:53.240 --> 3:56:58.200]  runs up to me and what happened next was something that I didn't expect to happen I thought he would
[3:56:58.200 --> 3:57:05.480]  ask me for the camera but before asking me he grabs me by my shoulders and says give me the
[3:57:05.480 --> 3:57:11.880]  camera now this is the policy is if you refuse to give up an electronic device you receive two
[3:57:11.880 --> 3:57:18.440]  detentions now if the school was just and followed their policies this would this would be definitely
[3:57:18.440 --> 3:57:26.200]  worth continuing by my operation of but this guy is judge dread so he's gonna physically punish you
[3:57:26.200 --> 3:57:31.720]  yeah so I said you know you're not getting the camera give me the two detentions he goes it
[3:57:31.720 --> 3:57:38.600]  doesn't work that way for me he then grabs me from behind as if as if he's bare hugging me but
[3:57:38.600 --> 3:57:44.360]  aggressively and begins to jerk me around trying to get the camera and which leads to me being
[3:57:44.360 --> 3:57:51.640]  flung sideways into a locker I then got free and began to remove the memory card because I didn't
[3:57:51.640 --> 3:57:55.720]  want to be assaulted anymore in the hallway so I figured I'd give him the camera and keep the memory
[3:57:55.720 --> 3:58:01.480]  card for any footage and what he did not then was grab my wrist with the memory card on it
[3:58:01.480 --> 3:58:06.440]  grab my wrist hard and say and he said give me the hard drive you're not taking the hard drive
[3:58:06.440 --> 3:58:12.120]  so he wanted the evidence of what he's done I have a special guest with us in the next hour
