[02:08.360 --> 02:12.400]  air conditioning fatties cause global warming they want to tax you for what
[02:12.400 --> 02:18.160]  you eat and what you do expelled no intelligence allowed finally had a
[02:18.160 --> 02:23.400]  chance to see this film it's not even a creationist film it's top scientists
[02:23.400 --> 02:28.600]  saying who aren't even Christian that it looks like something designed life and
[02:28.600 --> 02:33.040]  it shows how they fire all the professors that even asked the question
[02:33.040 --> 02:40.160]  because Darwinism's the new religion and mr. Stein his Jewish who made the film
[02:40.160 --> 02:46.280]  he found out that it was the Darwinist and the eugenicist that run everything
[02:46.280 --> 02:50.160]  he came out with this last year folks it's it's right out of in game we know
[02:50.160 --> 02:55.760]  they had to see in game but the issue here is it's like a remake of in game I
[02:55.760 --> 03:04.080]  want to get this gentleman on the show the ADL came out and attacked him basically
[03:04.080 --> 03:08.800]  saying it's anti-semitic to expose the eugenics operation see there's a whole
[03:08.800 --> 03:14.960]  another level to this you expose the Nazis boom ADL attacks so I'm gonna talk
[03:14.960 --> 03:22.640]  about that you expose the real Nazis now but some 21-year-old speed head with a
[03:22.640 --> 03:27.440]  machine gun that you know they're quote busting well than the ADL's all over it
[03:27.440 --> 03:31.800]  also you've got this American journalist held in Iran eight-year prison
[03:31.800 --> 03:36.240]  sentence and the media is hyping it all up saying how dare them not give her a
[03:36.240 --> 03:40.240]  proper trial the globalists don't even give people trials under the Military
[03:40.240 --> 03:44.560]  Commissions Act and they have torture being admissible in military
[03:44.560 --> 03:48.000]  tribunals and then the tribunal finds you not guilty the president or his
[03:48.000 --> 03:51.880]  designate could order you secretly held and executed so I wanted to go into that
[03:51.880 --> 03:58.440]  hypocrisy and tied in representative Harman with the APAC situation all these
[03:58.440 --> 04:02.280]  foreign spies from Israel so it's a getting really really serious we'll be

[11:57.480 --> 12:01.080]  scaling down the back porch down to the ground and running off and then we

[12:06.040 --> 12:09.160]  story they couldn't be scaling down from the top story see how they did a
[12:09.160 --> 12:15.040]  straw man no we said before he moved they were in his house see how they play
[12:15.040 --> 12:20.720]  those games and they had quote family friends come out that it turned out
[12:20.720 --> 12:24.240]  weren't family friends that Webb had actually criticized the newspapers as
[12:24.240 --> 12:28.800]  quacks going I'm his good friend it's quite normal to sit yourself twice in
[12:28.800 --> 12:33.640]  the head I get shot twice in the head please don't have family friends
[12:33.640 --> 12:40.160]  popping I'm going oh yeah he told me he was gonna do it same thing some guy that

[12:54.600 --> 12:58.520]  an active investigation there were no signs of foul play Fairfax County police
[12:58.520 --> 13:05.680]  officer Sandra Ruck said local police said they called to Killerman's home at
[13:05.680 --> 13:12.360]  448m but would not say who'd placed the call to 9-1-1 Killerman 41 to 16 year
[13:12.360 --> 13:17.120]  old veteran of Freddie Mac had been the company CFOs of September after a
[13:17.120 --> 13:25.880]  government takeover the company following the housing crisis no Freddie Mac
[13:25.880 --> 13:29.080]  had been criticized for reckless business practices that some argued
[13:29.080 --> 13:33.000]  contributed to the housing and financial crisis the company is controlled
[13:33.000 --> 13:36.920]  with the government and who owns or guarantees about 13 million home loans
[13:36.920 --> 13:41.800]  yeah they spent 12.8 trillion which is more than all the mortgages in the US
[13:41.800 --> 13:45.600]  more than all the car loans in the US more than all the credit card all of
[13:45.600 --> 13:50.120]  them you pay them all off for that but they're not none of it gets paid off and
[13:50.120 --> 13:56.000]  then the people that actually work and pay taxes you will pay for it
[14:00.120 --> 14:05.120]  Killerman was named acting chief financial officer in September 2008 of
[14:05.120 --> 14:12.680]  the resignation of Anthony Buddy Pezel who stepped down after the government
[14:12.680 --> 14:17.840]  takeover and now they've got Freddie Mac and Fannie Man Freddie Mac former
[14:17.840 --> 14:22.280]  heads running the bank takeovers so they're they're good little creatures
[14:22.280 --> 14:28.040]  they follow orders and if they don't they die these guys are just but they've
[14:28.040 --> 14:32.320]  got clean cotton they were cufflinks and suits they're not doing anything wrong
[14:32.320 --> 14:35.880]  I mean look at the Nazis they wore suits look at the communists they were suits
[14:35.880 --> 14:44.600]  I mean look at Ted Bundy he wore suits only more trustworthy John Wayne
[14:44.600 --> 14:51.400]  Gasey is a clown then you know they're really trustworthy into my little kids
[14:51.400 --> 14:54.160]  and they were really little every time they see a clown they start crying
[14:54.160 --> 15:00.200]  stuff other stuff didn't scare him but a clown would it's good instincts it's
[15:00.200 --> 15:06.360]  like George Norris says he doesn't like clowns I don't like clowns either so he's
[15:06.360 --> 15:09.680]  dead look at the sound of Reuters we told you about this years ago people
[15:09.680 --> 15:12.640]  giggled snickered I mean it's mainstream information people just don't want to
[15:12.640 --> 15:20.200]  believe it robot killers killer robots a revolution in warfare and why is that
[15:20.200 --> 15:24.040]  important because then the globalists can order their drones their robots all
[15:24.040 --> 15:26.840]  pre-programmed to go out and do their bedding and they won't matter of the
[15:26.840 --> 15:32.040]  troops refused to fire on Americans they are trying to convert a third of the
[15:32.040 --> 15:39.640]  ground force by 2011 to robots and half of the Air Force by 2010 that's next
[15:39.640 --> 15:49.200]  year you can pull these numbers up and by 2014 the entire fighter you know all
[15:49.200 --> 15:57.960]  the new fighters coming out will be drone and we'll get into NLE09 FEMA makes
[15:57.960 --> 16:03.160]  preparations for martial law to the next level government hikes top income tax
[16:03.160 --> 16:07.120]  rate over 50% in England if you count all the taxes together they pay about 80%
[16:07.120 --> 16:18.720]  Francis about 87% and now I guess it'll be 85% or so in England because they
[16:18.720 --> 16:23.400]  just hiked it up so and of course then they have all these quote deductions
[16:23.400 --> 16:26.400]  it's 50% if you can get all the deductions but then they don't allow
[16:26.400 --> 16:29.600]  most those what's actually over 50 and the same things coming here we're going
[16:29.600 --> 16:35.600]  into banker bondage is the OECD and XM banks say they want that's the global
[16:35.600 --> 16:40.160]  government and they say they want over an 80% tax rate worldwide hope you enjoy
[16:40.160 --> 16:45.600]  it and I'm getting all these calls people are saying Alex you're right a bunch
[16:45.600 --> 16:49.520]  of the news will get to it later on the calls now Alex the Barack Obama's on
[16:49.520 --> 16:54.520]  TV he's announcing they're not going to prosecute the torturers and that they're
[16:54.520 --> 16:57.960]  going to protect him and that gets rid of the Nuremberg principle of they're
[16:57.960 --> 17:01.560]  telling the government commit crimes and we'll protect you absolutely just

[18:45.720 --> 18:50.760]  take the vaccinations and you know why you know why you should take it in and
[18:50.760 --> 18:54.920]  there's nothing I ain't gonna say it was wrong with it but it did you know
[18:54.920 --> 18:58.680]  mention a couple of things about side effects but they were really pushing
[18:58.680 --> 19:03.600]  the vaccinations last night and it was on Fox channel and I think I was

[24:19.120 --> 24:22.360]  to take more calls right now but I thought I'd go back over what happened
[24:22.360 --> 24:29.680]  with the swine flu epidemic in the 1970s they just came out and said oh there's a
[24:29.680 --> 24:34.440]  deadly threat of the 1918 flu breaking back out turned out it was false people
[24:34.440 --> 24:39.160]  took the shot and thousands died and you tell adults about this today they go hey
[24:39.160 --> 24:42.280]  remember the swine flu vaccine killing a bunch of people they go doesn't exist
[24:42.280 --> 24:45.960]  shut up liar and they take the shot and have convulsions and fall over and die
[24:45.960 --> 24:52.560]  and you go but I warns you and they just go shut up I want the shot I want cancer
[24:52.560 --> 24:57.040]  and so we'll be covering that later and tying it into US officials track new
[24:57.040 --> 24:59.760]  flu strain
[25:03.040 --> 25:10.280]  okay let's go ahead and talk to Ray in Pennsylvania you're on the air Ray
[25:10.280 --> 25:18.760]  hello yes sir hi Alex I appreciate your work in regards to these persistent
[25:18.760 --> 25:24.280]  contrails that we see all the time I was wondering if you thought that maybe one
[25:24.280 --> 25:30.040]  of the reasons why it's happening is that maybe they're trying to bring on the
[25:30.040 --> 25:35.880]  next ice age it seems we're in a cooling trend and you know what better way to
[25:35.880 --> 25:40.080]  kill off a whole lot of us than to you know bring on the next ice age but the
[25:40.080 --> 25:44.760]  science shows that the type of aerosol spraying they're engaging in the
[25:44.760 --> 25:48.560]  older violent goes through and then bounces back up in and it traps more
[25:48.560 --> 25:53.760]  heat I know that they've done studies with volcanoes actually putting
[25:53.760 --> 25:58.120]  particulate into the air that cool the planet but a lot of the scientists and
[25:58.120 --> 26:02.240]  climatologists say that the type of chemtrail aerosol programs that are
[26:02.240 --> 26:05.760]  going on the government now admits they've quote been testing on a massive
[26:05.760 --> 26:10.280]  scale it's kind of like testing hanging someone in the gallows but it breaks
[26:10.280 --> 26:14.840]  their neck kind of like 9-11 was a test drill as you know the cover story they
[26:14.840 --> 26:19.960]  used they were running drills that day but you notice it was people died but
[26:19.960 --> 26:25.360]  regardless they are terraforming the planet while saying carbon dioxide is
[26:25.360 --> 26:38.160]  deadly poison and that they have to restrict people's freedoms to protect
[26:38.160 --> 26:41.920]  everyone from the carbon dioxide they're listing now as a carcinogen I mean
[26:41.920 --> 26:46.560]  it's just ridiculous it's like if you use the scientific name for salt they've
[26:46.560 --> 26:49.560]  done studies where you can go to into a crowd 90 plus percent of the people
[26:49.560 --> 26:54.200]  believe you know if you say the scientific name of salt they say oh my
[26:54.200 --> 26:59.240]  gosh we need to ban it or if you say the scientific name of water most people
[26:59.240 --> 27:05.360]  will say yes we need to ban that and it just shows their complete ignorance
[27:05.360 --> 27:10.240]  um that's about all I had thanks appreciate it my hey thank you sir it's
[27:10.240 --> 27:14.840]  it's a great point I mean regardless they're terraforming the planet while
[27:14.840 --> 27:19.640]  telling us that they're worried about carbon dioxide making the seas rise and
[27:19.640 --> 27:24.880]  the sun just went into one of its weakest cycles ever recorded and so now the
[27:24.880 --> 27:28.840]  entire solar system is cooling and these are just absolute incontrovertible
[27:28.840 --> 27:34.200]  facts and they don't care they're launching total control of society
[27:34.200 --> 27:38.520]  through the control of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases which will
[27:38.520 --> 27:46.240]  just shut down all human activity in fact folks during the break guys will you
[27:46.240 --> 27:51.280]  print me the encyclopedia definition of water and the encyclopedia definition
[27:51.280 --> 27:57.400]  of salt I want to come back and read their scientific names of salt and water
[27:57.400 --> 28:02.800]  and then I folks print this off yourself and then take it to your work and say
[28:02.800 --> 28:07.320]  hey guys you know it say when you're in the break room eating lunch say hey
[28:07.320 --> 28:15.280]  should we ban this I've got a petition I want you to sign to ban this this thing
[28:15.280 --> 28:19.720]  that's in the water supply don't even say it's bad and they'll say okay I'll sign
[28:19.720 --> 28:23.560]  and then you know read them read them the definition and so see you want to ban
[28:23.560 --> 28:29.240]  water or you want to ban salt but a lot of them don't want to admit they've been
[28:29.240 --> 28:33.360]  conned they'll go ahead and say yeah I want to ban water and I'm and now they're
[28:33.360 --> 28:36.840]  saying water footprints bad they're now you can Google that mainstream news and
[28:36.840 --> 28:40.320]  we got to restrict water it's deadly so see I shouldn't joke about this stuff
[28:40.320 --> 28:45.320]  and maybe giving them ideas Scott in Tennessee Scott you're on the air yes
[28:45.320 --> 28:49.960]  can you hear me yes sir I'm right now the Declaration of Independence that
[28:49.960 --> 28:54.280]  whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends is the right
[28:54.280 --> 28:58.920]  of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying
[28:58.920 --> 29:03.760]  its foundation of such principles in organizing its powers in such form as
[29:03.760 --> 29:08.480]  them most likely secondly safely and happiness the point is I was not talking
[29:08.480 --> 29:13.800]  at the Kingsport Tea Party to David Davis and I was asking him you know how
[29:13.800 --> 29:18.200]  close are we to reclaiming the state's sovereignty he says we're still a good
[29:18.200 --> 29:22.560]  ways off I'm just wondering what you think because I'm gonna be talking to
[29:22.560 --> 29:28.760]  George on this what what does each of us what can we do in each phase to get
[29:28.760 --> 29:33.160]  closer to you know to have a competition in this all right stay there we'll go
[29:33.160 --> 29:37.800]  right back to you then I'm gonna break down bio weapon releases through flu

[33:39.880 --> 33:46.880]  now let's go back to Scott in Tennessee Scott go ahead and recap your question
[33:46.880 --> 33:50.000]  I mean you're basically saying how do we get the Liberty Movement going how do
[33:50.000 --> 33:53.640]  we redeclare the Declaration of Independence against the bankers that
[33:53.640 --> 33:57.080]  have seized control the nation through Northcom and have openly set up a
[33:57.080 --> 34:00.280]  military dictatorship well I mean I think we first have to educate the
[34:00.280 --> 34:06.400]  sheeple who are starting to get some idea of what's happened because if we
[34:06.400 --> 34:09.800]  don't educate them first they will believe the media when they say that
[34:09.800 --> 34:13.920]  anyone talking about taking our government back as a terrorist you see
[34:13.920 --> 34:17.520]  first they told the sheep we're building this giant police state for al-Qaeda and
[34:17.520 --> 34:21.760]  now they're saying by the way anyone who talks about freedoms al-Qaeda we're
[34:21.760 --> 34:26.440]  you know they're now admitting what they really built it for just with another
[34:26.440 --> 34:31.600]  layer of spin and it's so asinine that if we just point out what a fraud it is
[34:31.600 --> 34:37.640]  it'll blow up in their face politically but arrest the bankers now that's the
[34:37.640 --> 34:42.160]  answer arrest the new world order heads take our country back that's the way to
[34:42.160 --> 34:45.400]  do this is try to use the juries and grand juries and they're gonna kill
[34:45.400 --> 34:49.840]  people they're gonna commit homicides they're gonna commit assassinations but
[34:49.840 --> 34:52.960]  it doesn't mean they can get us all I mean if we all wake up to these criminals
[34:52.960 --> 34:57.880]  there's nothing they can do they need our acquiescence that's why they stage
[34:57.880 --> 35:02.000]  terror attacks and poses our saviors they need to get the people on their
[35:02.000 --> 35:07.320]  side well once people know their tricks it doesn't work anymore if they try to
[35:07.320 --> 35:11.800]  have a police state nobody shows up go ahead yes what's that what he was saying
[35:11.800 --> 35:16.160]  at the tea party in Kingsport here in Kingsport Tennessee you can actually do
[35:16.160 --> 35:20.280]  more good they said for the local offices you can do you know a couple
[35:20.280 --> 35:24.400]  people showing up the local offices then you got a thousand people in the
[35:24.400 --> 35:28.960]  you know in government I mean in the Washington there he was just saying kind
[35:28.960 --> 35:33.120]  of focus on that I'm just wondering what can we do all of us do and every state
[35:33.120 --> 35:36.200]  to like you said no we wake people up of course I've been telling people about
[35:36.200 --> 35:41.240]  info wars at prisonplanet.com and of course your bomb deception but what
[35:41.240 --> 35:46.040]  can we do to really really see you cuz people don't they don't grasp unless it
[35:46.040 --> 35:51.800]  really affects them directly you know well Washington has heard the American
[35:51.800 --> 35:55.720]  people say we don't like you we know your criminal so they said quick hire lots
[35:55.720 --> 35:59.760]  of paramilitary police to suppress the people so we can keep robbing the
[35:59.760 --> 36:05.000]  people and that's what tyranny is unpopular criminal government that
[36:05.000 --> 36:08.400]  then oppresses the population so they can stay in power and carry out their
[36:08.400 --> 36:12.640]  crimes unabated and they hire sadistic criminals who enjoy doing bad things and
[36:12.640 --> 36:16.720]  set up their own little criminal empires and then the big boys can't punish them
[36:16.720 --> 36:20.200]  because that would expose their own system and so things get worse and
[36:20.200 --> 36:25.560]  worse and worse you collapse like North Korea or Mexico or Nazi Germany I mean
[36:25.560 --> 36:28.680]  are you specifically asking how to wake people up I mean or what are you saying
[36:28.680 --> 36:32.360]  well what it is like I said when I was asking you know talking about the state
[36:32.360 --> 36:36.720]  sovereignty you was talking to George on his show and you know we get focused on
[36:36.720 --> 36:43.480]  the state so how do we focus on it what can we do well I mean I told listeners
[36:43.480 --> 36:47.320]  and I know that our listeners are instrumental in what happened to call
[36:47.320 --> 36:51.520]  the state legislature and tell them past ninth and tenth amendment resolutions
[36:51.520 --> 36:54.800]  and they're on the verge of passing it and even Rick Perry has been forced to
[36:54.800 --> 36:58.640]  come out and endorse it because he knows which way the wind is blowing so he can
[36:58.640 --> 37:03.640]  pose as a patriot and try to co-opt it later but it's happening I mean
[37:03.640 --> 37:07.080]  multiple states have passed it scores of other states are on the verge of
[37:07.080 --> 37:11.680]  passing it but then passing it isn't enough we have to continue to enforce it
[37:11.680 --> 37:19.000]  and I appreciate your call it's a good question this is an ongoing battle you
[37:19.000 --> 37:22.520]  know we fought the trans-Texas corridor first they came out and said yeah it's a
[37:22.520 --> 37:27.080]  North American Union wonderful Napa superhighways we're taking over all your
[37:27.080 --> 37:31.040]  major roads it'll be international zones you'll pay tolls on it but it's gonna be
[37:31.040 --> 37:35.040]  great for the economy and we said no we don't want that about six years ago so
[37:35.040 --> 37:40.080]  they said okay we're not building toll roads they don't exist there's no foreign
[37:40.080 --> 37:43.920]  companies like central Zachary involved and we're not doing it people simple
[37:43.920 --> 37:46.680]  here's all your documents you're building the roads right now and taking over
[37:46.680 --> 37:51.520]  existing okay we are but it's what you need and they put up billboards everywhere
[37:51.520 --> 37:56.040]  with a cowboy going I love the trans-Texas corridor and all these TV and radio ads
[37:56.040 --> 38:01.520]  with good old boys literally going I love Texas pride rodeos and I love toll
[38:01.520 --> 38:09.720]  roads it's Texas pride so that didn't work and the legislature passed laws
[38:09.720 --> 38:13.400]  saying they couldn't do it and couldn't grab existing roads to do it and then
[38:13.400 --> 38:16.680]  Rick Perry came in and signed a veto and said I don't care what you say we're
[38:16.680 --> 38:20.160]  doing it and they'd have meetings all over the state they'd come in line of
[38:20.160 --> 38:23.800]  people and thousands would show up and and then literally threaten them and
[38:23.800 --> 38:27.320]  then they'd say well we're still doing it then lawsuits were filed and it came
[38:27.320 --> 38:30.840]  out how criminal it was and how mafia groups were paying people off and how
[38:30.840 --> 38:34.840]  they were grabbing 8,000 miles of roads now the transponders would charge you
[38:34.840 --> 38:40.840]  $168 to drive to Dallas from Austin and back and so then they announced three
[38:40.840 --> 38:44.480]  months ago okay the trans-Texas corridor is completely canceled three
[38:44.480 --> 38:48.000]  paragraphs down it said we're continuing the entire project we're just not
[38:48.000 --> 38:51.080]  naming it trans-Texas corridor we're taking down the billboards we're gonna
[38:51.080 --> 38:59.920]  just do it piece by piece and that's just their latest trick it's kind of
[38:59.920 --> 39:02.280]  like we're in a sword fight with them and we start beating them so they go I
[39:02.280 --> 39:07.280]  give up I give up they dropped their sword please quarter I give up we we
[39:07.280 --> 39:12.280]  start to shake their hand and they got a dagger that comes out of their sleeve
[39:12.280 --> 39:14.680]  and they're trying to stab it in our stomach and we just caught them again
[39:14.680 --> 39:21.040]  they went I mean I'm your friend oh no no no no no no no I know I just tried to
[39:21.040 --> 39:25.480]  stab you when I said quarter you know when I said the gimme you know when I
[39:25.480 --> 39:32.680]  cried uncle trust me the dagger was to be I was giving you the dagger point
[39:32.680 --> 39:40.280]  first it's a it's a gift and then we kind of gullibly the American idol crowd
[39:40.280 --> 39:43.200]  as people drop dead from the Gardasil shot you know running the ads are perfect
[39:43.200 --> 39:46.960]  demographic the American Idol crowd just kind of goes okay and thanks for the
[39:46.960 --> 39:51.320]  nice knife it's a nice gift and right as we're reaching for it they flip it back
[39:51.320 --> 39:56.080]  towards point first and stab us and oh I'm sorry that was an accident I mean I'm
[39:56.080 --> 39:59.160]  the government I'm not a bunch of criminals stealing everything everything's
[39:59.160 --> 40:02.760]  fine never mind you know that we're beating you up at checkpoints everywhere
[40:02.760 --> 40:09.240]  never mind all the cameras everywhere everything's fine everything's fine so I
[40:09.240 --> 40:14.680]  mean it's just ongoing we have a giant criminal class and Bush triple the size
[40:14.680 --> 40:23.840]  of government Obama in one year is doubling the tripling and he spent
[40:23.840 --> 40:30.880]  more money than all presidents before him combined from George W. Bush to George
[40:30.880 --> 40:35.080]  Washington from George W. Bush through Bill Clinton through all of them right
[40:35.080 --> 40:46.000]  through John Quincy Adams right back to 1789 all of them and he comes out and
[40:46.000 --> 40:50.320]  says I'm cutting the budget in half and there's headlines about Obama and fixes
[40:50.320 --> 40:59.640]  the debt I mean just total lie massive total lying that's the country we live
[40:59.640 --> 41:13.200]  in and meanwhile the United Nations the World Trade Organization the
[41:13.200 --> 41:16.520]  International Bank of Settlements the Organization of Economic the
[41:16.520 --> 41:20.160]  Organization of Economic Cooperative Development the OECD the big receivership
[41:20.160 --> 41:24.760]  that's the real global government set up after World War II for the Marshall
[41:24.760 --> 41:30.280]  Plan big private corporation they openly state they want an 80 plus percent
[41:30.280 --> 41:35.440]  tax rate they're raising taxes worldwide and they're bringing in the green taxes
[41:35.440 --> 41:44.440]  hundreds of taxes on meat on cars on glass on rubber on on on timber on food
[41:44.440 --> 41:51.040]  just everything but the control the inspectors the harassment the
[41:51.040 --> 42:02.680]  bureaucracies and what they do is they go you don't want carbon dioxide to come
[42:02.680 --> 42:05.560]  in contact with your children do you they literally do this when people go no
[42:05.560 --> 42:10.920]  no and there's literally scores of video games free video games at Nickelodeon
[42:10.920 --> 42:15.880]  online and all and in public schools where carbon monsters carbon oxide
[42:15.880 --> 42:18.680]  tries to kill the children and the children are literally afraid of it
[42:18.680 --> 42:22.880]  like it's radon gas or something they don't know that it's what plants breathe
[42:22.880 --> 42:26.800]  we're all breathing in every second but it's literally the life gas as much as
[42:26.800 --> 42:33.680]  oxygen and they are scared to death folks and the establishment laughs and
[42:33.680 --> 42:37.560]  rolls and giggles I've been to smart row conferences with the world elite they
[42:37.560 --> 42:40.680]  had one right here in Austin in 98 and they just laugh and go yeah it's a scam
[42:40.680 --> 42:52.200]  and start laughing right to my face it is a big joke they just laugh
[42:52.200 --> 42:57.680]  taxing breathing taxing everything a colorless or white crystalline solid
[42:57.680 --> 43:04.000]  sodium chloride you can walk up to anybody and say do you think hi in fact
[43:04.000 --> 43:09.360]  we're gonna do this for the new Obama film I've decided to do it we're gonna
[43:09.360 --> 43:14.120]  go out and I'm gonna go out on the streets of Austin I'm gonna have a clip
[43:14.120 --> 43:18.240]  board or I may have my office people do it so we don't get recognized more
[43:18.240 --> 43:21.880]  people also know who I am I'm gonna send the guys had to go hi in front of a
[43:21.880 --> 43:25.760]  grocery store yes we're here trying to get you to sign petitions there's a
[43:25.760 --> 43:30.480]  sodium chloride in the water supply but there's something even worse in the
[43:30.480 --> 43:36.360]  water supply there's dihydrogen monoxide and we just want to have you sign the
[43:36.360 --> 43:39.840]  petition for the city to an investigation of dihydrogen monoxide in the
[43:39.840 --> 43:44.040]  water and folks I have seen studies by universities pen and teller copied this
[43:44.040 --> 43:51.440]  and did this and 90 plus percent people say absolutely ban it immediately
[43:51.440 --> 43:57.840]  well there's a problem dihydrogen monoxide is water so I don't know how
[43:57.840 --> 44:09.720]  you get dihydrogen monoxide out of the dihydrogen monoxide H2O dihydrogen
[44:09.720 --> 44:20.440]  monoxide that is the scientific name of it and you can go up and tell them we
[44:20.440 --> 44:28.000]  need to ban sodium chloride and they'll sodium chloride but I mean think of it
[44:28.000 --> 44:31.440]  they're passing laws that will literally cripple what's left of our industry
[44:31.440 --> 44:34.280]  which the globalists have always wanted wasn't enough tax incentives to move
[44:34.280 --> 44:39.520]  offshore wasn't enough every little factory every business banning space
[44:39.520 --> 44:44.240]  heaters everything total control bureaucrats in your life you think
[44:44.240 --> 44:53.600]  ordinances zoning are bad now they already banned the CFC's back in the
[44:53.600 --> 44:58.040]  80s claiming at eight holes in the ozone layer turns out that those naturally
[44:58.040 --> 45:05.600]  occur above the poles where the magnetic field of the earth comes in and also
[45:05.600 --> 45:09.600]  there's a lot of studies showing that the thousands of nukes detonated in the
[45:09.600 --> 45:14.560]  upper atmosphere by Russia the United States France England China everybody
[45:14.560 --> 45:18.160]  else they would they would fire them up in high altitude and test them those
[45:18.160 --> 45:21.720]  blue holes in the ozone layer but forget that forget the fact that they'd use
[45:21.720 --> 45:26.080]  thousands of times all the uranium with du all over the place at proving
[45:26.080 --> 45:29.760]  grounds and shooting ranges and in wars and that's blowing around all over the
[45:29.760 --> 45:37.800]  world not a problem carbon dioxide at the plankton and the plants that
[45:37.800 --> 45:45.840]  literally runs the earth but the oceans give off just trillions of times what
[45:45.840 --> 45:51.960]  humans do every day admittedly it's just off the charts what the oceans go up
[45:51.960 --> 45:58.400]  with the amount of biomass in life in there it's deadly and ladies and
[45:58.400 --> 46:03.720]  gentlemen they are now talking about water being poisonous in British news
[46:03.720 --> 46:06.760]  articles in the government saying they want to start taxing water footprint
[46:06.760 --> 46:11.600]  because water's bad and the public will buy it because they're into being
[46:11.600 --> 46:17.040]  schmucks and gullible they're into being screwed they love it they love being
[46:17.040 --> 46:20.640]  suckers because once you buy into being suckered you're given over to great
[46:20.640 --> 46:25.040]  delusion they can't admit they've been suckered so they'll buy any suckering
[46:25.040 --> 46:31.960]  there is they were born to be scammed they were born to be defrauded they
[46:31.960 --> 46:40.440]  want it he does it because he likes it this is what he wants this is what he
[46:40.440 --> 46:46.080]  gets he wants it he gets it
[46:51.000 --> 46:56.280]  so here's pen and teller going out with a reporter asking people about banning
[46:56.280 --> 47:03.800]  water the hydrogen monoxide and listen to them well here it is this is a petition
[47:03.800 --> 47:08.240]  for dihydrogen monoxide what it is is it's a chemical that is found now in
[47:08.240 --> 47:11.920]  reservoirs and in lakes pesticides different kind of companies are using
[47:11.920 --> 47:17.040]  this it's styrofoam companies nuclear nuclear companies and now when they use
[47:17.040 --> 47:19.800]  it in pesticides when we're washing our fruit and things like that it's not
[47:19.800 --> 47:23.160]  coming out which of course means that it's ended up in the grocery stores and
[47:23.160 --> 47:27.380]  in our baby's food and stuff like that causes excessive sweating excessive
[47:27.380 --> 47:32.200]  urination anything to help the environment these people sign we don't
[47:32.200 --> 47:35.880]  know if they thought but they signed there we are
[47:35.880 --> 47:42.120]  can I get you guys to sign a petition for a banning dihydrogen monoxide thank
[47:42.120 --> 47:45.760]  you very much and our petition woman was getting signatures left and right
[47:45.760 --> 47:51.160]  okay mostly left but man there's a lot of people against that evil water it's
[47:51.160 --> 47:56.520]  everywhere and we just really need to ban it these passionate informed people
[47:56.520 --> 48:02.320]  didn't even need to ask what the hydrogen monoxide is they didn't even ask is
[48:02.320 --> 48:08.600]  passion supposed to replace common sense we understand the desire to join up and
[48:08.600 --> 48:14.160]  do something important it's sexy to save the world but you've got to spend a
[48:14.160 --> 48:17.720]  couple of minutes to find out if you're really saving the world and not just
[48:17.720 --> 48:23.440]  being herded around by some politically motivated who may not really care that
[48:23.440 --> 48:28.000]  much about the environment but see this is some chance to raise money forever
[48:28.000 --> 48:36.440]  they think is a good idea no end justifies the means of lying man there
[48:36.440 --> 48:39.680]  were a lot of people who signed the petition and we're not talking a handful
[48:39.680 --> 48:43.920]  of dopes we're talking hundreds a lot of urination
[48:43.920 --> 48:51.320]  vomiting yeah okay even the head organizer of this rally signed the
[48:51.320 --> 48:58.720]  petition eagerly thank you very much and our petition was still getting
[48:58.720 --> 49:03.160]  signatures companies like pesticide companies styrofoam companies nuclear
[49:03.160 --> 49:10.760]  companies all of these people use it finally we let her tip it water something
[49:10.760 --> 49:19.680]  that should be banned what what sort of water water should be banned yes I don't
[49:19.680 --> 49:24.440]  think so I think we need to drink water and I don't know what you mean by what
[49:24.440 --> 49:29.440]  it should be banned this petition is to ban water hydrogen monoxide is water
[49:29.440 --> 49:42.960]  we set these folks up but it does show that maybe they're not so much
[49:42.960 --> 49:48.920]  environmentalists as they are joiners of anything all right now we're gonna do
[49:48.920 --> 49:55.840]  something similar bring about water salt and oxygen we're gonna give them the
[49:55.840 --> 49:59.880]  scientific name for oxygen it really sounds scary and they're gonna say that
[49:59.880 --> 50:07.800]  and I have I believe they're gonna love it because they love being idiots and see
[50:07.800 --> 50:11.360]  once you've bought into this banned carbon dioxide business that they're now
[50:11.360 --> 50:15.960]  listed as a carcinogen and a toxic waste they will never admit they were
[50:15.960 --> 50:21.840]  conned because these are jellyfish these were spoiled brats that the World War
[50:21.840 --> 50:26.360]  two generation had who just had pampered little lives and they love being
[50:26.360 --> 50:31.680]  idiots period and they're rolling their daughter's sleeves up and shooting them
[50:31.680 --> 50:35.200]  up with Gardasil they're dropping dead having convulsions and they don't care
[50:35.200 --> 50:39.080]  either they won't admit that that was a scam because these are cowards and
[50:39.080 --> 50:44.000]  they're too afraid to admit there's a big bad monster called the New World Order
[50:44.000 --> 50:47.680]  carrying eugenics out against them so they're a lot smarter than the Nazis see
[50:47.680 --> 50:51.160]  how they carry all this out everybody loves it loves dying and loves what's

[1:14:36.520 --> 1:14:40.160]  this is a cult ladies this is a eugenics war attack
[1:14:40.160 --> 1:14:42.200]  you think i'm joking you'll see
[1:14:42.200 --> 1:14:45.640]  a website with the online carbon calculator
[1:14:45.640 --> 1:14:49.680]  they help us to measure their energy consumption so they can reduce it and save
[1:14:49.680 --> 1:14:50.480]  money
[1:14:50.480 --> 1:14:52.800]  and a social networking component
[1:14:52.800 --> 1:14:56.680]  so they can communicate yet grow their cancer with like-minded neighbors
[1:14:56.680 --> 1:15:00.880]  has yet to materialize because nobody supports you and i'm here fighting you
[1:15:00.880 --> 1:15:02.840]  and we're winning we're beating you
[1:15:02.840 --> 1:15:04.480]  folks that strike me down
[1:15:04.480 --> 1:15:07.200]  just make sure ten more of you fill my place
[1:15:07.200 --> 1:15:10.240]  because it's an honor to fight these people
[1:15:10.240 --> 1:15:14.720]  that is the late attempts to promote climate protection in the community
[1:15:14.720 --> 1:15:17.680]  a deadline for the report on meeting city targets
[1:15:17.680 --> 1:15:19.400]  was missed last year
[1:15:19.400 --> 1:15:23.000]  but now they've got a cia officer in there to get the job done
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:26.600]  the city budget eight hundred and five thousand eight hundred sixty four dollars
[1:15:26.600 --> 1:15:27.440]  this year
[1:15:27.440 --> 1:15:32.480]  for the committee protection program the climate protection program
[1:15:32.480 --> 1:15:35.200]  the tyranny protection program it's green turning
[1:15:35.200 --> 1:15:39.520]  that includes pay for nine full and part-time employees both young talents
[1:15:39.520 --> 1:15:40.160]  and
[1:15:40.160 --> 1:15:44.560]  sprinkling of veterans of that
[1:15:44.560 --> 1:15:45.920]  this is their total program
[1:15:45.920 --> 1:15:49.680]  city officials say the program will save money in the long run
[1:15:49.680 --> 1:15:53.360]  by determining ways to cut overall energy use
[1:15:53.360 --> 1:15:58.040]  the program is reduced carbon emissions which scientists link to global warming
[1:15:58.040 --> 1:15:59.760]  and which steward says we'll get
[1:15:59.760 --> 1:16:03.520]  price here the federal government begins regulating them
[1:16:03.520 --> 1:16:07.880]  as part of a broad strategy the state investments in energy efficiency programs
[1:16:07.880 --> 1:16:09.160]  such as
[1:16:09.160 --> 1:16:11.080]  subsidizing home
[1:16:11.080 --> 1:16:15.120]  insulation upgrades to avoid having to pay more electricity
[1:16:15.120 --> 1:16:17.240]  and build more electricity plants
[1:16:17.240 --> 1:16:20.400]  now see notice they always makes in reasonable stuff like all will help you
[1:16:20.400 --> 1:16:21.160]  get some
[1:16:21.160 --> 1:16:24.720]  insulation will help you see they always put reasonable stuff in there
[1:16:24.720 --> 1:16:29.400]  to make it sound reasonable like rat poison is ninety eight percent good food
[1:16:29.400 --> 1:16:30.680]  understand that works
[1:16:30.680 --> 1:16:33.520]  this is ninety eight percent rat poison though
[1:16:33.520 --> 1:16:37.440]  i'm pleased with some of the programs disappointed with others
[1:16:37.440 --> 1:16:41.400]  of the program said mayor will win what a cretin
[1:16:41.400 --> 1:16:42.880]  who push it forward last year
[1:16:42.880 --> 1:16:45.320]  with the sponsorship of city council member lee
[1:16:45.320 --> 1:16:47.520]  laughing well
[1:16:47.520 --> 1:16:49.240]  and bruster mccracken
[1:16:49.240 --> 1:16:52.680]  both now mayoral candidates who lie about everything incessantly on that
[1:16:52.680 --> 1:16:55.000]  when said he was thrilled
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:57.040]  for example the city had added
[1:16:57.040 --> 1:16:58.920]  to its fleet vehicles
[1:16:58.920 --> 1:17:02.480]  such as plug-in
[1:17:02.480 --> 1:17:06.160]  turn the page hybrids that don't rely on gasoline see sounds reasonable
[1:17:06.160 --> 1:17:08.880]  but disappointed that contracts the city considers hiring
[1:17:08.880 --> 1:17:12.160]  are not scored on the environmental policy see that's what they really want
[1:17:12.160 --> 1:17:13.280]  to is mafia
[1:17:13.280 --> 1:17:17.520]  only their people getting contracts that's where the than another big scam is
[1:17:17.520 --> 1:17:21.280]  then by the city council stolen most farms and ranches around town they take
[1:17:21.280 --> 1:17:23.720]  them and build luxury hotels and houses on
[1:17:23.720 --> 1:17:26.680]  always claiming it was going to be a preserve
[1:17:26.680 --> 1:17:28.680]  and just goes on to talk about uh...
[1:17:28.680 --> 1:17:31.560]  at texas and imba university where he said in biology
[1:17:31.560 --> 1:17:32.760]  that's where you learn the eugenics
[1:17:32.760 --> 1:17:34.240]  environmental science
[1:17:34.240 --> 1:17:37.320]  he began aggy
[1:17:37.320 --> 1:17:42.240]  replant students planted trees she can sounds reasonable
[1:17:42.240 --> 1:17:45.640]  and it goes on to say in ninety eighty paid off school loans
[1:17:45.640 --> 1:17:50.200]  he'd uh... score high military exams he was sent to defense language institute
[1:17:50.200 --> 1:17:53.640]  where he studied russian and chinese and became an intelligent specialist
[1:17:53.640 --> 1:17:56.880]  working with u s army special forces see i didn't read the article yet not
[1:17:56.880 --> 1:17:58.760]  told you was an intel
[1:17:58.760 --> 1:18:01.080]  because i know i mean it's
[1:18:01.080 --> 1:18:05.880]  and i had a bigger crew i go down to his office in front of the cameras

[1:18:20.200 --> 1:18:22.720]  it was about those about the goal of actually blurting out while sitting
[1:18:22.720 --> 1:18:24.480]  there by the microphone on air i said
[1:18:24.480 --> 1:18:27.960]  hey what about uh... the if the journal and rockheimer saying that they go in
[1:18:27.960 --> 1:18:30.200]  and kill everybody in the villages
[1:18:30.200 --> 1:18:33.640]  he's looked at me and smiled in
[1:18:33.640 --> 1:18:36.240]  then during the break he was just looking at me and he was just said yeah i'm
[1:18:36.240 --> 1:18:39.400]  intel yeah i'm running off what's the big deal
[1:18:39.400 --> 1:18:41.440]  because i was on there i was going you're on the not right here in town

[1:18:49.680 --> 1:18:52.720]  he was just you're gonna lose and just walked out
[1:18:52.720 --> 1:18:59.280]  that's kind of like whenever i had uh...
[1:18:59.280 --> 1:19:02.160]  uh... what's the professor that uh...
[1:19:02.160 --> 1:19:03.520]  thomas barnett

[1:20:57.040 --> 1:21:17.040]  Hello, Ted Anderson. Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[1:21:17.040 --> 1:21:27.040]  A small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal. Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[1:21:27.040 --> 1:21:33.040]  A current effort is underway by the Fed, along with other central banks, to increase liquidity for depositors.
[1:21:33.040 --> 1:21:38.040]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation.
[1:21:38.040 --> 1:21:46.040]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[1:21:46.040 --> 1:21:53.040]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[1:21:53.040 --> 1:22:00.040]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237. That's 1-800-686-2237.
[1:22:00.040 --> 1:22:06.040]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:22:06.040 --> 1:22:12.040]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[1:22:12.040 --> 1:22:19.040]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[1:22:19.040 --> 1:22:23.040]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[1:22:23.040 --> 1:22:36.040]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[1:22:36.040 --> 1:22:47.040]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[1:24:14.040 --> 1:24:26.040]  Ira Hayes. Ira Hayes. Call him drunken Ira Hayes. He will answer it.
[1:24:26.040 --> 1:24:34.040]  Do you have any idea how illegal it is when they've got a military taking over the police departments and everything else in every town and city?
[1:24:34.040 --> 1:24:41.040]  You know how illegal that is? They admit they've got CIA and the fusion centers, the threat integration centers everywhere.
[1:24:41.040 --> 1:24:47.040]  They're doing this big drill for FEMA to take over the US with foreign troops, mainstream news.
[1:24:47.040 --> 1:24:53.040]  This is the hellish system we live in and they've got all these well-meaning cult members that carry it out for them.
[1:24:53.040 --> 1:25:00.040]  Thank you, Jeff, for that amazing call because this is why I like taking calls because it brings up all these issues.
[1:25:00.040 --> 1:25:02.040]  George in Illinois, you're on the air.
[1:25:02.040 --> 1:25:04.040]  Hey, Alex, can you hear me?
[1:25:04.040 --> 1:25:05.040]  Yes, sir.
[1:25:05.040 --> 1:25:13.040]  All right. The main thing I wanted to bring up was my brother was a wounded veteran in Iraq and also a gun owner.
[1:25:13.040 --> 1:25:22.040]  And the other day, he came home and there was a guy sitting outside with a PDA that said, Property of US Government.
[1:25:22.040 --> 1:25:25.040]  And he asked him, you know, what are you doing? He said, I'm with the census.
[1:25:25.040 --> 1:25:31.040]  He wouldn't show him any ID and he only stood in front of my brother's house when he left.
[1:25:31.040 --> 1:25:41.040]  You know, they're going around. Look, Bill Clinton, the last thing he did was list over 100,000 veterans who had PTSD that they couldn't own guns,
[1:25:41.040 --> 1:25:44.040]  even though there was no law saying that.
[1:25:44.040 --> 1:25:49.040]  And then we keep telling vets and police and everybody else, you think you're part of the New World Order, you're the real target.
[1:25:49.040 --> 1:25:54.040]  And now we have the secret federal documents that we released, a whole bunch of them,
[1:25:54.040 --> 1:26:00.040]  and others have gotten stating that police and military and gun owners and others are the number one threat to the government.
[1:26:00.040 --> 1:26:05.040]  They don't go along with the program. And so, yes, they're GPS marking where the veterans live.
[1:26:05.040 --> 1:26:08.040]  And this is not a game, folks.
[1:26:08.040 --> 1:26:12.040]  So how do you say to this piece of garbage?
[1:26:12.040 --> 1:26:18.040]  What did he say? He said, I'm with the census. He wouldn't answer anything else. He didn't have any ID.
[1:26:18.040 --> 1:26:27.040]  My uncle's actually a police commander in Illinois and he said that they're all supposed to wear an ID around their neck, you know.
[1:26:27.040 --> 1:26:34.040]  The guy wouldn't show ID and didn't say anything else besides I'm with the census and I drove off.
[1:26:34.040 --> 1:26:39.040]  Yeah, the big thing is they also will come across gates, come on people's land,
[1:26:39.040 --> 1:26:43.040]  and there were cases where they even come in houses and beat people up. Don't believe me, Google it from the last census.
[1:26:43.040 --> 1:26:49.040]  But see, they only have a census for those that don't know to apportion how many state representatives your state gets.
[1:26:49.040 --> 1:26:52.040]  So all it is is how many people are there. That's all they can ask.
[1:26:52.040 --> 1:26:55.040]  But they send you a form saying you'll be arrested if you don't do this.
[1:26:55.040 --> 1:27:02.040]  But you notice it's got a line under it for only the first question. It's only for that part. It's a contract trick.
[1:27:02.040 --> 1:27:05.040]  You don't have to answer the rest of it. But go ahead.
[1:27:05.040 --> 1:27:10.040]  Well, the other thing I wanted to bring up was, I'm sure you're aware of it, the Mothers Act.
[1:27:10.040 --> 1:27:11.040]  Yes.
[1:27:11.040 --> 1:27:15.040]  This thing where they have to do a questionnaire after the baby's born and if the questionnaire is...
[1:27:15.040 --> 1:27:20.040]  Yes, you must answer the questionnaire and they say they want to put all mothers on Prozac, basically.
[1:27:20.040 --> 1:27:27.040]  It says all mothers are mentally ill. It says all mothers are depressed and need drugs.
[1:27:27.040 --> 1:27:31.040]  I know, it's just insane. You can't make this stuff up. Go ahead.
[1:27:31.040 --> 1:27:35.040]  Well, the other thing I wanted to say is just we've been copying the Obama deception end game
[1:27:35.040 --> 1:27:39.040]  and putting them in everyone's mailboxes in our town.
[1:27:39.040 --> 1:27:45.040]  And the thing I wanted to say was there's a really good Megadeth song.
[1:27:45.040 --> 1:27:48.040]  If you're looking for songs to go between segments, it's called New World Order.
[1:27:48.040 --> 1:27:51.040]  It's not on any album, but just thought I'd throw that out there.
[1:27:51.040 --> 1:27:52.040]  Megadeth?
[1:27:52.040 --> 1:27:54.040]  Yeah, it's a song called New World Order.
[1:27:54.040 --> 1:27:57.040]  Or, since you guys are in Texas, I'm a big Pantera fan.
[1:27:57.040 --> 1:27:59.040]  Revolution is my name. That's a good...
[1:27:59.040 --> 1:28:03.040]  We've actually had Dave Mustang on the show.
[1:28:03.040 --> 1:28:04.040]  Really?
[1:28:04.040 --> 1:28:05.040]  Yeah.
[1:28:05.040 --> 1:28:08.040]  That's really cool, man. I didn't know that.
[1:28:08.040 --> 1:28:11.040]  Do you have the dates so I can check it on YouTube?
[1:28:11.040 --> 1:28:17.040]  If you just Google Dave Mustang on Alex Jones, you'll find it.
[1:28:17.040 --> 1:28:20.040]  Oh, that's really cool.
[1:28:20.040 --> 1:28:23.040]  Absolutely, my friend.
[1:28:23.040 --> 1:28:25.040]  Yeah, and just everyone listening, man.
[1:28:25.040 --> 1:28:29.040]  You know, get a copy of the movie and just start copying it and hand it out to people.
[1:28:29.040 --> 1:28:33.040]  I mean, I was the first couple of times I handed it to people thinking, you know,
[1:28:33.040 --> 1:28:35.040]  they're going to attack me or start yelling at me.
[1:28:35.040 --> 1:28:39.040]  And people are really receptive when you approach them level-headed and say,
[1:28:39.040 --> 1:28:43.040]  look, you know, how much your 401k is left. Watch this movie.
[1:28:43.040 --> 1:28:44.040]  Absolutely.
[1:28:44.040 --> 1:28:45.040]  Absolutely.
[1:28:45.040 --> 1:28:51.040]  That's so little. Folks are waking up now, but I don't think they're waking up to just how bad it really is.
[1:28:51.040 --> 1:28:56.040]  It's...I mean, you got to prepare.
[1:28:56.040 --> 1:29:00.040]  Well, I keep repeating this like a parent, but it's true.
[1:29:00.040 --> 1:29:05.040]  People have to understand tyranny is what happens almost in every case in history.
[1:29:05.040 --> 1:29:09.040]  Horrible bondage, control, corrupt groups of criminals, get together, take over societies,
[1:29:09.040 --> 1:29:11.040]  have a bunch of bologna reasons.
[1:29:11.040 --> 1:29:13.040]  They're doing what they're doing to sell the public.
[1:29:13.040 --> 1:29:16.880]  And then when the public finally wakes up, they just use the iron fist to carry it out.
[1:29:16.880 --> 1:29:18.700]  And that's what's happening right now.
[1:29:18.700 --> 1:29:21.480]  And this green revolution has nothing to do with the environment.
[1:29:21.480 --> 1:29:26.840]  It's about micromanaging and controlling every facet of your life.
[1:29:26.840 --> 1:29:29.240]  So I appreciate your call.
[1:29:29.240 --> 1:29:34.560]  Okay, Lenny, Scott, Warren, Ronnie, others, your calls are straight ahead.
[1:29:34.560 --> 1:29:37.920]  Judge DePaulitano scheduled later, but I'm supposed to go on Iranian TV, so I think
[1:29:37.920 --> 1:29:41.840]  Burmese may be sitting in with him when that happens, because I don't want to turn down
[1:29:41.840 --> 1:29:44.080]  talking to those folks.
[1:29:44.080 --> 1:29:48.760]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with more of your calls and a ton of news.
[1:29:48.760 --> 1:29:51.480]  Stay with me, infowars.com.
[1:29:51.480 --> 1:29:55.200]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[1:29:55.200 --> 1:30:01.440]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:01.440 --> 1:30:02.440]  You worry.
[1:30:02.440 --> 1:30:04.400]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[1:30:04.400 --> 1:30:07.040]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[1:30:07.040 --> 1:30:09.200]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[1:30:09.200 --> 1:30:10.880]  Your answer may be at hand.
[1:30:10.880 --> 1:30:14.400]  Brother Linda Runyon lived off the land isolated from civilization.
[1:30:14.400 --> 1:30:18.440]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over
[1:30:18.440 --> 1:30:19.840]  God's green earth.
[1:30:19.840 --> 1:30:23.560]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[1:30:23.560 --> 1:30:25.480]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[1:30:25.480 --> 1:30:28.200]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[1:30:28.200 --> 1:30:31.720]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[1:30:31.720 --> 1:30:35.840]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flash
[1:30:35.840 --> 1:30:40.400]  cards and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality and joy.
[1:30:40.400 --> 1:30:45.080]  And how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use and store it.
[1:30:45.080 --> 1:30:49.120]  Go to Linda's website ofthefield.com and take advantage of special offers.

[1:30:58.240 --> 1:31:15.080]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[1:31:15.080 --> 1:31:20.240]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:31:20.240 --> 1:31:37.760]  of the American people.
[1:31:37.760 --> 1:31:41.320]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[1:31:41.320 --> 1:31:48.240]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told and his real agenda.
[1:31:48.240 --> 1:31:56.400]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv.
[1:31:56.400 --> 1:32:01.200]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[1:32:01.200 --> 1:32:05.520]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and
[1:32:05.520 --> 1:32:10.240]  China have now penetrated our power grid, even as energy experts are reporting that
[1:32:10.240 --> 1:32:14.440]  each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid.
[1:32:14.440 --> 1:32:19.720]  Some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge,
[1:32:19.720 --> 1:32:24.480]  creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[1:32:24.480 --> 1:32:29.920]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[1:32:29.920 --> 1:32:34.480]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private
[1:32:34.480 --> 1:32:36.360]  supply of electrical power?
[1:32:36.360 --> 1:32:40.520]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[1:32:40.520 --> 1:32:42.960]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[1:32:42.960 --> 1:32:48.560]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[1:32:48.560 --> 1:32:53.600]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com.
[1:32:53.600 --> 1:32:55.960]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[1:32:55.960 --> 1:33:21.960]  Check out mysolarbackup.com before you lose your power.
[1:33:21.960 --> 1:33:36.040]  Let's continue with your phone calls here.
[1:33:36.040 --> 1:33:37.040]  Lenny in New York.
[1:33:37.040 --> 1:33:38.040]  You're on the air.
[1:33:38.040 --> 1:33:39.040]  Go ahead.
[1:33:39.040 --> 1:33:40.040]  How are you doing?
[1:33:40.040 --> 1:33:41.040]  Good.
[1:33:41.040 --> 1:33:47.640]  I was watching T-Span 2 yesterday at 3.10 p.m. when a Republican senator got on attacking
[1:33:47.640 --> 1:33:52.120]  a big government, mentioning the Federal Reserve printing all this money, attacking the left-right
[1:33:52.120 --> 1:33:59.560]  paradigm, and he also says that everybody that went to Tea Parties were terrorists,
[1:33:59.560 --> 1:34:02.960]  were regarded terrorists.
[1:34:02.960 --> 1:34:05.920]  You mean he was exposing that, or was he just saying that?
[1:34:05.920 --> 1:34:10.560]  He said, yeah, he was exposing it, and then the Democrat got on an atom and pretty much
[1:34:10.560 --> 1:34:11.560]  like defended the left.
[1:34:11.560 --> 1:34:15.560]  Even though he was saying that it wasn't about what left or right, it was just about
[1:34:15.560 --> 1:34:19.480]  the government, and you should check it out, 3.10 p.m. yesterday, Eastern Time.
[1:34:19.480 --> 1:34:23.080]  Well, they've got to make it about the left-right.
[1:34:23.080 --> 1:34:25.080]  What was the name of the senator?
[1:34:25.080 --> 1:34:26.080]  I don't know.
[1:34:26.080 --> 1:34:28.480]  The Republican senator was on at 3.10 Eastern Time yesterday.
[1:34:28.480 --> 1:34:31.120]  I'm trying to find it right now, but I can't online.
[1:34:31.120 --> 1:34:32.880]  Well, they're desperate to keep us divided.
[1:34:32.880 --> 1:34:35.520]  They don't want whites to feel comfortable around blacks and Hispanics.
[1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:39.040]  They don't want blacks and Hispanics to feel comfortable around whites.
[1:34:39.040 --> 1:34:42.920]  Everything they do is about divide and conquer, and it's a simple game, so the thieves can
[1:34:42.920 --> 1:34:45.080]  sit up there robbing us and stealing.
[1:34:45.080 --> 1:34:50.240]  The scary part is how they're putting CIA, Army, and Marines in all the police departments
[1:34:50.240 --> 1:34:51.240]  and other city agencies.
[1:34:51.240 --> 1:34:53.640]  I mean, the coup is happening right now.
[1:34:53.640 --> 1:34:57.440]  They are taking everything over, and it's funny to them.
[1:34:57.440 --> 1:35:01.280]  They'll just sit there right in your face and laugh at you.
[1:35:01.280 --> 1:35:03.920]  They're in to being slave masters.
[1:35:03.920 --> 1:35:07.400]  They enjoy the power trip of being part of government.
[1:35:07.400 --> 1:35:08.480]  They're social climbers.
[1:35:08.480 --> 1:35:10.480]  They think, what gets me the most power?
[1:35:10.480 --> 1:35:11.920]  Selling out, I'm doing it.
[1:35:11.920 --> 1:35:13.760]  They don't even think about it.
[1:35:13.760 --> 1:35:18.680]  And to those of us that aren't parasites or scum, it's just so shocking to realize they're
[1:35:18.680 --> 1:35:23.440]  these people, but they're there, and they got to be met with force, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:35:23.440 --> 1:35:28.360]  That means confronting them, rebuking them, exposing them, and then when they try to parasite
[1:35:28.360 --> 1:35:32.840]  and suck your, suck your substance out, you know, you got to resist them, so I appreciate
[1:35:32.840 --> 1:35:33.840]  your calling.
[1:35:33.840 --> 1:35:34.840]  Anything else?
[1:35:34.840 --> 1:35:35.840]  No, thank you, sir.
[1:35:35.840 --> 1:35:36.840]  Thank you for all your work.
[1:35:36.840 --> 1:35:37.840]  God bless you, Lenny.
[1:35:37.840 --> 1:35:38.840]  Thank you.
[1:35:38.840 --> 1:35:39.840]  Scott in Illinois.
[1:35:39.840 --> 1:35:40.840]  Scott, you're on the air.
[1:35:40.840 --> 1:35:41.840]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[1:35:41.840 --> 1:35:48.360]  I, on CNN, they had a thing about the environmental police saying how the environmental police
[1:35:48.360 --> 1:35:53.600]  are for the whale, they said there's a whale that comes into New York Harbor once a month
[1:35:53.600 --> 1:35:54.600]  or something.
[1:35:54.600 --> 1:35:56.440]  There's a whale, and they're there to protect the whale.
[1:35:56.440 --> 1:36:00.880]  Yeah, they always introduce it with something that sounds reasonable, and then it's literal
[1:36:00.880 --> 1:36:03.440]  control freaks at your door, demanding an inspection.
[1:36:03.440 --> 1:36:05.280]  Yeah, that's the second part.
[1:36:05.280 --> 1:36:08.960]  The second part, they said, oh, this is the part the officers hate to do, and they show
[1:36:08.960 --> 1:36:13.480]  them harassing somebody in a truck with something they put up through his exhaust pipe, and hand
[1:36:13.480 --> 1:36:16.280]  them a ticket saying, oh, there's something wrong with your engine, you have to go get
[1:36:16.280 --> 1:36:17.280]  it fixed.
[1:36:17.280 --> 1:36:18.280]  Here you go.
[1:36:18.280 --> 1:36:19.960]  So it's just a way to eliminate the little guy.
[1:36:19.960 --> 1:36:26.240]  And that's also, that's also just to train you to have secret police, it's training you
[1:36:26.240 --> 1:36:32.360]  to be used to cops talking to you, cops lining you up, that's what the airport, that's what
[1:36:32.360 --> 1:36:36.160]  the airport training is, take your shoes off, be a slave, answer questions.
[1:36:36.160 --> 1:36:38.840]  This is what everything's going to be like.
[1:36:38.840 --> 1:36:44.920]  And they also, on another point, they had another video out of press being harassed by
[1:36:44.920 --> 1:36:45.920]  the police.
[1:36:45.920 --> 1:36:51.800]  We're going to play it, we're going to play it next hour, maybe see news, just 50 yards
[1:36:51.800 --> 1:36:57.880]  away trying to video, cop comes up and just goes, this is the freedom you got, ha, yah!
[1:36:57.880 --> 1:37:00.320]  And so that's how it works, my friend.
[1:37:00.320 --> 1:37:02.880]  And that's ready for.
[1:37:02.880 --> 1:37:03.880]  Go ahead.
[1:37:03.880 --> 1:37:04.880]  Anything else?
[1:37:04.880 --> 1:37:09.200]  The only other one was they also had a story this morning about the banks, how they're
[1:37:09.200 --> 1:37:14.080]  raising the interest rates and they say it's because their costs are going up, yet they're
[1:37:14.080 --> 1:37:19.720]  reporting $40 billion in profit, but you're raising your rates because the cost is going
[1:37:19.720 --> 1:37:20.720]  up.
[1:37:20.720 --> 1:37:23.080]  Of course they're making profits off the trillions they've been given.
[1:37:23.080 --> 1:37:24.080]  Yeah.
[1:37:24.080 --> 1:37:27.360]  Like the profits are falling out the sky and that money that you gave them is just for
[1:37:27.360 --> 1:37:28.360]  their cost.
[1:37:28.360 --> 1:37:29.360]  They'll see, see.
[1:37:29.360 --> 1:37:30.360]  That doesn't go into that profit.
[1:37:30.360 --> 1:37:34.200]  They were given the money by the globalists not to loan, they said, look, don't loan,
[1:37:34.200 --> 1:37:35.200]  they said, but we need to make money.
[1:37:35.200 --> 1:37:36.200]  I said, don't worry.
[1:37:36.200 --> 1:37:37.200]  Yeah.
[1:37:37.200 --> 1:37:38.200]  Hort on the cash.
[1:37:38.200 --> 1:37:42.560]  Well, you know, they want to shut the economy down, but they even need the smaller banks
[1:37:42.560 --> 1:37:43.840]  to not loan to do that.
[1:37:43.840 --> 1:37:47.120]  So they say, here's the money, don't loan, you're being paid off, not to loan, just
[1:37:47.120 --> 1:37:50.560]  keep the money for yourself so that everything falls apart.
[1:37:50.560 --> 1:37:51.560]  You understand?
[1:37:51.560 --> 1:37:53.000]  That's exactly what they're doing.
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:58.800]  I did not die so much here coming, it's like, wow, I'm like, when you say that with that
[1:37:58.800 --> 1:38:02.920]  voice in the back of your head, start screaming at you, get out, get out, get out, and that's
[1:38:02.920 --> 1:38:05.040]  something that's got a bullhorn in my ear.
[1:38:05.040 --> 1:38:11.080]  Well, Scott, listen, just drink some more fluoride and, you know, and just love the government.
[1:38:11.080 --> 1:38:12.920]  And it's going to be great.
[1:38:12.920 --> 1:38:13.920]  They're here to help us.
[1:38:13.920 --> 1:38:14.920]  Come on, Scott.
[1:38:14.920 --> 1:38:17.280]  Man, have a good day, Alex.
[1:38:17.280 --> 1:38:18.280]  Take care, Scott.
[1:38:18.280 --> 1:38:19.280]  What an extremist.
[1:38:19.280 --> 1:38:21.000]  I mean, everything's fine.
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  Everything's good.
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  Ronnie in Texas.
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  You're on the air.
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  Go ahead, Ronnie.
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  Thank you, sir.
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  God bless guns.
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:31.640]  As you know, the second amendment keeps on keeping us all free.
[1:38:31.640 --> 1:38:33.480]  Sir, that's Al-Qaeda talk, please.
[1:38:33.480 --> 1:38:39.960]  Well, that's me, I guess, from foreign invasion, keeping us free from federal government enslavement,
[1:38:39.960 --> 1:38:46.080]  you know, and just imagine, you know, it's really, it gives me joy.
[1:38:46.080 --> 1:38:52.880]  Over a hundred million gun-toting, freedom-fighting patriots among us now, and nobody here or
[1:38:52.880 --> 1:38:56.080]  abroad could even imagine conquering our nation.
[1:38:56.080 --> 1:39:00.880]  We didn't have those guns, all these control freaks who know what's best for us, they could
[1:39:00.880 --> 1:39:04.200]  then really crack our heads and really reorganize and re-educate us.
[1:39:04.200 --> 1:39:08.360]  Well, that's the punchline I was trying to get to, you know, they can't even imagine
[1:39:08.360 --> 1:39:10.760]  conquering us without disarming us first.
[1:39:10.760 --> 1:39:16.800]  Say hello to our very own mirage of a merciless, barraque-a-gun-grabbing-trader Obama, you
[1:39:16.800 --> 1:39:17.800]  know.
[1:39:17.800 --> 1:39:23.240]  I mean, you know, as a state legislator, and as state legislator in Illinois, led the
[1:39:23.240 --> 1:39:26.920]  charge to deny all Americans access to any gun.
[1:39:26.920 --> 1:39:30.760]  He's for total gun bans, and they will show his votes, and they say it doesn't exist.
[1:39:30.760 --> 1:39:35.840]  I'm surprised they say Obama doesn't exist whenever we criticize him, but then he will
[1:39:35.840 --> 1:39:37.120]  exist when they're promoting him.
[1:39:37.120 --> 1:39:41.320]  It's like, oh, there he is on TV, but you say he, you don't like him, or he doesn't
[1:39:41.320 --> 1:39:42.320]  exist.
[1:39:42.320 --> 1:39:46.680]  Well, and also, as in the case in England right now, you know, since the nine guns to
[1:39:46.680 --> 1:39:50.440]  law-abiding citizens in England, the violent crime rate has gone through the roof over
[1:39:50.440 --> 1:39:51.440]  there.
[1:39:51.440 --> 1:39:52.440]  Well, that's it.
[1:39:52.440 --> 1:39:55.680]  And now, even the Bobby's have to carry guns, first time ever, you know, in hundreds of
[1:39:55.680 --> 1:40:02.920]  years, but now the Bobby's like a dog you train for being of tasted blood, and they beat that
[1:40:02.920 --> 1:40:03.920]  guy to death.
[1:40:03.920 --> 1:40:04.920]  They did a fake autopsy.
[1:40:04.920 --> 1:40:05.920]  It came out it was fake.
[1:40:05.920 --> 1:40:06.920]  They did another one.
[1:40:06.920 --> 1:40:07.920]  They beat him to death.
[1:40:07.920 --> 1:40:08.920]  He was just delivering newspapers.
[1:40:08.920 --> 1:40:10.240]  I mean, come on, man.
[1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:14.040]  That guy was causing a problem delivering newspapers, and he's dead now, and it's good
[1:40:14.040 --> 1:40:16.000]  the police covered it up.
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:18.920]  That guy was, you know, this is freedom, sir.
[1:40:18.920 --> 1:40:19.920]  Guns exist.
[1:40:19.920 --> 1:40:24.320]  Hey, well, pretend otherwise is foolish, and you're responsibly provocative, I think,
[1:40:24.320 --> 1:40:25.320]  about guns.
[1:40:25.320 --> 1:40:29.600]  Well, you know, it's true, some people die from gun violence, but some people die in
[1:40:29.600 --> 1:40:30.600]  correction.
[1:40:30.600 --> 1:40:34.400]  It's also true that the presence of guns prevents crime every day.
[1:40:34.400 --> 1:40:39.200]  Well, people always say, people always say the number one cause of death is cancer and
[1:40:39.200 --> 1:40:43.360]  heart attacks, but that's natural causes or unnatural from the vaccines.
[1:40:43.360 --> 1:40:45.720]  The biggest cause of death is doctors and prescription drugs.
[1:40:45.720 --> 1:40:46.800]  I appreciate your call.
[1:40:46.800 --> 1:40:49.160]  So why don't we talk about banning men?
[1:40:49.160 --> 1:40:53.360]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[1:40:53.360 --> 1:40:56.720]  Let's talk to Warren in Michigan.
[1:40:56.720 --> 1:40:57.720]  I know where this is going.
[1:40:57.720 --> 1:40:58.720]  Go ahead, Warren.
[1:40:58.720 --> 1:40:59.720]  Hi, Alex.
[1:40:59.720 --> 1:41:04.840]  I'm just calling to make a plug for Ellen Hodgeson-Brown.
[1:41:04.840 --> 1:41:08.760]  She writes, she's written a bunch of articles that have shown up on Infowars.com.
[1:41:08.760 --> 1:41:12.840]  I'm surprised you haven't had her on as a guest.
[1:41:12.840 --> 1:41:17.800]  She's got a book called Web of Death, which is a really well-written book that explains
[1:41:17.800 --> 1:41:21.600]  all this banking stuff to simpletons like me.
[1:41:21.600 --> 1:41:26.720]  There's another Warren that always calls in on the same subject, so I thought that was
[1:41:26.720 --> 1:41:29.320]  the Warren that was calling him, so I was going to him.
[1:41:29.320 --> 1:41:31.120]  But specifically, what does she get into?
[1:41:31.120 --> 1:41:33.000]  I think I remember seeing some of her articles.
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:38.880]  Well, basically, she takes the position that's similar to Richard C. Cook that printing money
[1:41:38.880 --> 1:41:44.160]  is a natural power of the government, and governments don't have to borrow from private
[1:41:44.160 --> 1:41:45.160]  banks.
[1:41:45.160 --> 1:41:46.160]  Oh, yeah, of course.
[1:41:46.160 --> 1:41:50.040]  But they killed the presidents that wouldn't go along with the private bankers taking over.
[1:41:50.040 --> 1:41:53.400]  So, you know, the president's kind of learned to do what the boss says.
[1:41:53.400 --> 1:41:54.400]  Yeah.
[1:41:54.400 --> 1:42:00.200]  Her most recent article, she had that tower of basal argument, article up on your site.
[1:42:00.200 --> 1:42:01.200]  Yes, yes.
[1:42:01.200 --> 1:42:02.200]  Good story.
[1:42:02.200 --> 1:42:03.200]  Really well-written article.
[1:42:03.200 --> 1:42:06.560]  And then, you know, you ought to get her on for an hour or two.
[1:42:06.560 --> 1:42:07.560]  I agree.
[1:42:07.560 --> 1:42:08.560]  Great points.
[1:42:08.560 --> 1:42:09.560]  Good to hear from you, Warren.
[1:42:09.560 --> 1:42:10.560]  Ronny in Texas.
[1:42:10.560 --> 1:42:14.120]  Ronny, you're on the air.
[1:42:14.120 --> 1:42:20.480]  Okay, Ronny's not there.
[1:42:20.480 --> 1:42:21.480]  David.
[1:42:21.480 --> 1:42:23.240]  David and Denver, you're on the air.
[1:42:23.240 --> 1:42:24.240]  Go ahead, David.
[1:42:24.240 --> 1:42:25.240]  Yeah, hi.
[1:42:25.240 --> 1:42:26.240]  Hi, Alex.
[1:42:26.240 --> 1:42:27.240]  Hey, buddy.
[1:42:27.240 --> 1:42:28.240]  I really appreciate what you're doing.
[1:42:28.240 --> 1:42:34.240]  I follow politics for a long time, and I, you know, I went through the whole phase of
[1:42:34.240 --> 1:42:40.960]  just pure sadness and not believing where we're at here, you know, I've always suspected
[1:42:40.960 --> 1:42:41.960]  something.
[1:42:41.960 --> 1:42:46.480]  But you're not upset about body scanners in the airport and checkpoints on the streets
[1:42:46.480 --> 1:42:50.760]  and a $12.8 trillion spent in, spent in the last few months, more than all presidents
[1:42:50.760 --> 1:42:52.120]  before him combined.
[1:42:52.120 --> 1:42:56.040]  You're not upset about the million plus dead Iraqis or the president saying torture's
[1:42:56.040 --> 1:42:58.600]  okay or warrantless wiretapping.
[1:42:58.600 --> 1:43:02.040]  You're not upset about how the standard of living is dropping and folks are losing their
[1:43:02.040 --> 1:43:04.320]  jobs and it seems like we have no future.
[1:43:04.320 --> 1:43:06.680]  The borders are wide open and we're going bankrupt.
[1:43:06.680 --> 1:43:10.680]  You're upset because you're racist and don't like the Arab president.
[1:43:10.680 --> 1:43:13.480]  Oh, I know, and I mean, what I finally realized was-
[1:43:13.480 --> 1:43:15.640]  That's why you're a racist.
[1:43:15.640 --> 1:43:16.640]  It's real simple.
[1:43:16.640 --> 1:43:22.520]  Well, we have to, you know, the term liberal is a very kind term, and I think we need to
[1:43:22.520 --> 1:43:24.560]  start telling them, you know, calling it like it is.
[1:43:24.560 --> 1:43:25.560]  These are not liberals.
[1:43:25.560 --> 1:43:27.080]  I mean, they may think they're progressive liberals.
[1:43:27.080 --> 1:43:31.640]  They're broadsucking Stalinistic parasite, control freaks who love ruling over people.
[1:43:31.640 --> 1:43:36.400]  Look, look, if you can't produce something and you're a nobody but you want power, that's
[1:43:36.400 --> 1:43:37.400]  what a liberal is.
[1:43:37.400 --> 1:43:41.920]  I mean, the mainline liberals in power are parasites that want to steal what you got.
[1:43:41.920 --> 1:43:46.920]  And that's it, a bunch of smooth talking crooks, and they got the quote, right wingers who
[1:43:46.920 --> 1:43:50.560]  are a bunch of warmongering crooks that they work with, and that's the end of it.
[1:43:50.560 --> 1:43:52.720]  They're a bunch of blood-sucking crooks.
[1:43:52.720 --> 1:43:53.720]  It's real simple.
[1:43:53.720 --> 1:43:57.360]  I think, you know, we have to wake these people up, you know, some of the things they tout
[1:43:57.360 --> 1:44:02.080]  and they use against us are something that, you know, things that you could actually believe
[1:44:02.080 --> 1:44:03.080]  in.
[1:44:03.080 --> 1:44:04.080]  But I think-
[1:44:04.080 --> 1:44:08.120]  These blood-sucking mainline liberals, they're all getting their cancer injections.
[1:44:08.120 --> 1:44:11.560]  They're all, when they're all dying, dead or in a hammer, their kids are, they're dying.
[1:44:11.560 --> 1:44:12.720]  They'll know I'm right.
[1:44:12.720 --> 1:44:13.720]  It doesn't matter.
[1:44:13.720 --> 1:44:16.120]  We're too far along the eugenics wars right now.
[1:44:16.120 --> 1:44:17.120]  We're deep into this.
[1:44:17.120 --> 1:44:18.120]  We're under attack.
[1:44:18.120 --> 1:44:20.200]  And so I don't care what the scum thinks.
[1:44:20.200 --> 1:44:21.840]  They're going to wake up down the road.
[1:44:21.840 --> 1:44:22.840]  Go ahead.
[1:44:22.840 --> 1:44:29.040]  Well, and before, before, before I hang up, I want to ask you, you know, a lot of people
[1:44:29.040 --> 1:44:31.440]  talk about this, and I know you don't like Beck.
[1:44:31.440 --> 1:44:35.360]  I like him for the fact that he's actually waking people up.
[1:44:35.360 --> 1:44:40.600]  He may not be who I think he is, but while he's serving a purpose, I think that's great.
[1:44:40.600 --> 1:44:46.200]  But my question is this, I don't see hardly anyone out there with any solutions.
[1:44:46.200 --> 1:44:50.160]  I mean, the only thing I see, and I finally decided, you know what, I'm tired of talking
[1:44:50.160 --> 1:44:52.320]  to people that won't wake up.
[1:44:52.320 --> 1:44:57.520]  I decided to make my own website and just post videos and show stuff coming right out
[1:44:57.520 --> 1:44:59.040]  of these people's mouths and who they are.
[1:44:59.040 --> 1:45:00.040]  Yes, we got to take them in.
[1:45:00.040 --> 1:45:01.280]  I want to know what we need to do.
[1:45:01.280 --> 1:45:03.560]  I think succeeding is about the only thing we can do.
[1:45:03.560 --> 1:45:08.200]  I mean, and as I mean, is there any, I appreciate your call, sir.
[1:45:08.200 --> 1:45:09.560]  I appreciate your call.
[1:45:09.560 --> 1:45:17.280]  Look, the reason I've gone after Beck and not Limbaugh or any of them is because, oh,
[1:45:17.280 --> 1:45:22.160]  by the way, I forgot guys, will you send up to the network so we go live on prisonplanet.tv.
[1:45:22.160 --> 1:45:24.320]  We can play it.
[1:45:24.320 --> 1:45:28.120]  Alan Key has now come out and said he believes Obama is going to stage a terror attack and
[1:45:28.120 --> 1:45:29.400]  declare martial law.
[1:45:29.400 --> 1:45:32.280]  And now Michael Savage has now come out and said that.
[1:45:32.280 --> 1:45:34.760]  So people are really starting to get it.
[1:45:34.760 --> 1:45:37.960]  Sir, you asked what a solution is.
[1:45:37.960 --> 1:45:42.640]  And the reason the politicians stay in power is they've always got some easy silver bullet
[1:45:42.640 --> 1:45:47.120]  made up thing that'll fix it all.
[1:45:47.120 --> 1:45:48.240]  And this is a process.
[1:45:48.240 --> 1:45:55.040]  It's a six and a half million people, complex world, all these continents, all these languages,
[1:45:55.040 --> 1:45:56.040]  all these cultures.
[1:45:56.040 --> 1:45:57.960]  It isn't one thing.
[1:45:57.960 --> 1:46:00.360]  It's a philosophy of liberty.
[1:46:00.360 --> 1:46:05.040]  And so it's awakening the people, a culture of liberty, being involved, being armed with
[1:46:05.040 --> 1:46:08.880]  information in the Second Amendment, not being cowards.
[1:46:08.880 --> 1:46:12.600]  Just saying no to the airports and no to the checkpoints and no to all of this.
[1:46:12.600 --> 1:46:13.880]  I'm not your slave.
[1:46:13.880 --> 1:46:16.280]  And, you know, decriminalizing drugs.
[1:46:16.280 --> 1:46:18.960]  You want to end a lot of this quickly, you decriminalize them.
[1:46:18.960 --> 1:46:21.080]  The globalists were the drug dealers.
[1:46:21.080 --> 1:46:23.600]  They made the drugs illegal to jack up prices.
[1:46:23.600 --> 1:46:28.880]  They lost their opium and cocaine monopolies in the 1920s and they were about to lose their
[1:46:28.880 --> 1:46:32.200]  prohibition in the 1930s of alcohol and they said, we've got to have something new for
[1:46:32.200 --> 1:46:34.000]  a black market.
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:35.480]  That's on record, man.
[1:46:35.480 --> 1:46:39.200]  The drug dealers made drugs illegal.
[1:46:39.200 --> 1:46:40.200]  Comprende?
[1:46:40.200 --> 1:46:44.960]  Who do you think likes drugs being illegal?
[1:46:44.960 --> 1:46:46.720]  The drug dealers.
[1:46:46.720 --> 1:46:47.720]  People run in our country.
[1:46:47.720 --> 1:46:50.560]  They're criminals.
[1:46:50.560 --> 1:46:53.800]  So you want solutions, there's one, the state's right, state's sovereignty.
[1:46:53.800 --> 1:46:55.400]  They haven't enough to succeed.
[1:46:55.400 --> 1:47:03.480]  The state's declare sovereignty and then get the federal government under control.
[1:47:03.480 --> 1:47:06.840]  So, I mean, what did the bankers do when they gave us the 1913 Private Federal Reserve
[1:47:06.840 --> 1:47:07.840]  Takeover?
[1:47:07.840 --> 1:47:11.840]  They gave us an income tax and took the senators away from the states.
[1:47:11.840 --> 1:47:17.040]  The state legislatures that we elect, they voted and appointed the senators.
[1:47:17.040 --> 1:47:18.040]  You get that back.
[1:47:18.040 --> 1:47:21.560]  But it's too dangerous to go into a constitutional convention to rewrite everything when we tried
[1:47:21.560 --> 1:47:26.280]  to go back to what we had, they guaranteed would go into more tyranny.
[1:47:26.280 --> 1:47:30.240]  But you point that out, you educate the public, you get involved.
[1:47:30.240 --> 1:47:33.920]  I don't want to talk about Glenn Beck anymore, other than the fact that he's leading some
[1:47:33.920 --> 1:47:34.920]  people astray.
[1:47:34.920 --> 1:47:37.160]  This is the guy who was reading out of federal documents.
[1:47:37.160 --> 1:47:41.360]  I said a year and a half ago, I said, that is a federal talking point.
[1:47:41.360 --> 1:47:45.080]  And you now see the federal documents saying gun owners, patriots or terrorists, number
[1:47:45.080 --> 1:47:47.080]  one threat.
[1:47:47.080 --> 1:47:48.440]  Ron Paul, people are a threat.
[1:47:48.440 --> 1:47:51.400]  I told you that was a talking point because I saw it on every channel.
[1:47:51.400 --> 1:47:54.960]  And Beck was leading the charge saying we need to use the army against these Ron Paul
[1:47:54.960 --> 1:47:55.960]  supporters.
[1:47:55.960 --> 1:47:56.960]  These are enemies of the republic.
[1:47:56.960 --> 1:47:57.960]  They're dangerous.
[1:47:57.960 --> 1:48:00.600]  And he knew what he was doing when he did that.
[1:48:00.600 --> 1:48:04.680]  Now, they couldn't beat us and they know we're taking over, we're taking the republic back
[1:48:04.680 --> 1:48:06.920]  one mind at a time.
[1:48:06.920 --> 1:48:08.840]  And so they're trying, they can't beat us.
[1:48:08.840 --> 1:48:13.720]  They're trying to join us and literally co-op what we're doing.
[1:48:13.720 --> 1:48:17.040]  So now he comes out, all the new old orders, real all the global governments, real, I believe
[1:48:17.040 --> 1:48:18.040]  the camps are real.
[1:48:18.040 --> 1:48:19.040]  I'm going to expose it.
[1:48:19.040 --> 1:48:21.280]  And then I said, he's not going to expose this and say they're fake.
[1:48:21.280 --> 1:48:22.480]  They said, shut up, Alice.
[1:48:22.480 --> 1:48:23.980]  He says they're real.
[1:48:23.980 --> 1:48:26.280]  And I said, watch and learn.
[1:48:26.280 --> 1:48:28.200]  I know what I'm talking about.
[1:48:28.200 --> 1:48:30.040]  This is all I do.
[1:48:30.040 --> 1:48:33.040]  I'm not whining, but I haven't even eaten today.
[1:48:33.040 --> 1:48:38.880]  And I've been up since early this morning because I just work all the time.
[1:48:38.880 --> 1:48:41.200]  This is all I do.
[1:48:41.200 --> 1:48:45.760]  During the breaks, I'm doing other radio shows doing quick, you know, pop-ins on AM and FM's.
[1:48:45.760 --> 1:48:52.080]  And I'm doing it because I want to defeat these enemies.
[1:48:52.080 --> 1:48:56.640]  And Glenn Beck is part of a PSYOP, period.
[1:48:56.640 --> 1:49:03.600]  And then he came out and said the camps weren't real, but there are good camps, he said, for
[1:49:03.600 --> 1:49:05.880]  our safety.
[1:49:05.880 --> 1:49:07.760]  I know their mind.
[1:49:07.760 --> 1:49:11.440]  So yes, he is waking up a lot of people only because we are already doing it and they've
[1:49:11.440 --> 1:49:16.200]  got to be there so that when folks wake up, they get captured because Fox News can play
[1:49:16.200 --> 1:49:21.200]  the part of the anti-establishment now because they're quote, out of power.
[1:49:21.200 --> 1:49:28.560]  They're tag-teaming us.
[1:49:28.560 --> 1:49:32.680]  So it's very elementary.
[1:49:32.680 --> 1:49:34.680]  It's very, very simple.
[1:49:34.680 --> 1:49:35.680]  I mean, it really is.
[1:49:35.680 --> 1:49:36.680]  Okay.
[1:49:36.680 --> 1:49:37.680]  I'm going to cover the bird flu stuff when we come back.
[1:49:37.680 --> 1:49:41.800]  And that swine flu, tying it all in, this is a key report coming up.
[1:49:41.800 --> 1:49:49.360]  I'm going to do then more of your phone calls, David, Corey, Steve, Rick and others.
[1:49:49.360 --> 1:49:52.480]  Before I go any further, I want to tell you about Eat Foods Direct, the wonderful folks
[1:49:52.480 --> 1:49:57.040]  at the J. Michael Stevens group, you know, with all the uncertainty and big talk by the
[1:49:57.040 --> 1:50:00.560]  IMF and World Bank of Depression and all the craziness that's going on, we need to be
[1:50:00.560 --> 1:50:01.560]  self-sufficient.
[1:50:01.560 --> 1:50:06.480]  Those of us that know what's going on, especially, I've said it a million times, 90% of people
[1:50:06.480 --> 1:50:09.520]  were self-sufficient in the Great Depression and 7 million starved to death.
[1:50:09.520 --> 1:50:13.320]  Some numbers say 12 million, but 7 million is conservative.
[1:50:13.320 --> 1:50:17.640]  Now we're 90% that are dependent and aren't living on farms.
[1:50:17.640 --> 1:50:20.240]  You need to be prepared as an insurance policy.
[1:50:20.240 --> 1:50:23.600]  I'm not saying there's going to be food shortages or hyperinflation, though the evidence shows
[1:50:23.600 --> 1:50:24.600]  that.
[1:50:24.600 --> 1:50:26.880]  I'm just saying there's a good chance you need to be prepared.
[1:50:26.880 --> 1:50:33.240]  Eat Foods Direct, the letter E, foodsdirect.com, eatfoodsdirect.com, or 1-800-409-5633.
[1:50:33.240 --> 1:50:37.320]  This is a storeable foods company, I believe, and this is who I get my storeable foods from,
[1:50:37.320 --> 1:50:41.680]  eatfoodsdirect.com, or 800-409-5633.
[1:50:41.680 --> 1:50:42.680]  And I'm a maniac, folks.
[1:50:42.680 --> 1:50:43.680]  I'm a freedom lover.
[1:50:43.680 --> 1:50:44.680]  I know what I'm facing.
[1:50:44.680 --> 1:50:46.120]  I know an enemy when I see it.
[1:50:46.120 --> 1:50:47.120]  And I'm just like a guard dog.
[1:50:47.120 --> 1:50:50.480]  He starts barking and yelling, and my fur is all puffed up, and I'm ready to rock and
[1:50:50.480 --> 1:50:51.480]  roll.
[1:50:51.480 --> 1:50:52.840]  I mean, I know what these bastards are.
[1:50:52.840 --> 1:50:53.840]  I studied history.
[1:50:53.840 --> 1:50:57.880]  I know they're putting regular army into every position of power in cities and counties everywhere.
[1:50:57.880 --> 1:51:01.360]  I mean, they mean business.
[1:51:01.360 --> 1:51:03.760]  The world appears to be on the brink of collapse.

[1:52:03.880 --> 1:52:04.880]  Me radio show.
[1:52:04.880 --> 1:52:08.080]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:52:08.080 --> 1:52:12.560]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[1:52:12.560 --> 1:52:13.880]  us would like to see.
[1:52:13.880 --> 1:52:19.040]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:52:19.040 --> 1:52:20.160]  of the American people.
[1:52:20.160 --> 1:52:24.800]  Well, Obama's already fudging, fudged since D1 in this election.
[1:52:24.800 --> 1:52:29.920]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[1:52:29.920 --> 1:52:38.040]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[1:52:38.040 --> 1:52:39.720]  It's not about left or right.
[1:52:39.720 --> 1:52:41.600]  It's about a one-world government.
[1:52:41.600 --> 1:52:48.520]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[1:53:01.240 --> 1:53:04.320]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[1:53:04.320 --> 1:53:09.960]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[1:53:09.960 --> 1:53:14.520]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which
[1:53:14.520 --> 1:53:15.520]  are synthetic.
[1:53:15.520 --> 1:53:16.920]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[1:53:16.920 --> 1:53:20.640]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to
[1:53:20.640 --> 1:53:25.120]  coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin,
[1:53:25.120 --> 1:53:26.120]  and mucous membranes.

[1:53:59.960 --> 1:54:15.040]  Okay, you can see the pattern here, go to the Encyclopedia Britannica and read all this
[1:54:15.040 --> 1:54:17.040]  information.
[1:54:17.040 --> 1:54:27.080]  Wikipedia eventually just copied what they have, but you can't ever trust Wikipedia.
[1:54:27.080 --> 1:54:37.040]  They had the swine flu epidemic, also known as the Spanish flu, that killed millions and
[1:54:37.040 --> 1:54:42.720]  millions of people, and it started on a U.S. military base in the United States.
[1:54:42.720 --> 1:54:45.480]  That's mainline history in Encyclopedia Britannica.
[1:54:45.480 --> 1:54:54.800]  Of course, the evidence is that was a bio weapons test, killed tens of millions worldwide.
[1:54:54.800 --> 1:55:02.520]  Americans argue 35 million to 60 million, let's just say 40 million people.
[1:55:02.520 --> 1:55:08.240]  And then again, in 1976, it popped up again on a military base.
[1:55:08.240 --> 1:55:12.320]  February 5th, 1976, an army recruited Fort Dix said he felt tired and weak.
[1:55:12.320 --> 1:55:16.680]  He died the next day, and four of his fellow soldiers were later hospitalized, and I've
[1:55:16.680 --> 1:55:19.440]  confirmed they've done thousands of tests on trips, killing them.
[1:55:19.440 --> 1:55:22.840]  That's all declassified, so they just never stop.
[1:55:22.840 --> 1:55:25.360]  This is the sickos that run everything, and they find plenty of people that want to go
[1:55:25.360 --> 1:55:28.080]  work for them and be killed by them or kill other people.
[1:55:28.080 --> 1:55:30.720]  It's just all part of a sick culture.
[1:55:30.720 --> 1:55:31.720]  Well they test you.
[1:55:31.720 --> 1:55:33.280]  If you're a psycho, they recruit you to higher levels.
[1:55:33.280 --> 1:55:36.200]  If you're not, you end up working on helicopters.
[1:55:36.200 --> 1:55:40.160]  Two weeks after his death, health officials announced that swine flu was the cause of
[1:55:40.160 --> 1:55:43.520]  death and the strain of flu appeared to be closely related to the strain involved in
[1:55:43.520 --> 1:55:46.720]  the 1918 flu pandemic.
[1:55:46.720 --> 1:55:52.280]  Alarm public health officials decided to take action to head off another major pandemic,
[1:55:52.280 --> 1:55:55.680]  and they urged every person in the United States to be vaccinated for the disease.
[1:55:55.680 --> 1:55:58.920]  President Gerald Ford was confronted with a potential swine flu pandemic.
[1:55:58.920 --> 1:56:02.480]  Of course, they just so happened to have the massive vaccine already produced.
[1:56:02.480 --> 1:56:05.200]  I mean, how staged is that?
[1:56:05.200 --> 1:56:11.840]  The vaccination program was plagued by delays and public relations problems, but about 24
[1:56:11.840 --> 1:56:15.160]  percent of the population was vaccinated at the time the program was scheduled.
[1:56:15.160 --> 1:56:20.600]  Now, tens of thousands died, folks, if you do the real research, but this source is here,
[1:56:20.600 --> 1:56:28.200]  the University of Illinois at Springfield, uis.edu, forward slash health services, forward
[1:56:28.200 --> 1:56:33.800]  slash immunization, forward slash flu vaccine.htm, you can go read it there.
[1:56:33.800 --> 1:56:43.200]  And it gets into, it says evidence, enough evidence suggests that about 500 cases of
[1:56:43.200 --> 1:56:49.680]  Gillian-Marais syndrome resulting in death from severe pulmonary complications.
[1:56:49.680 --> 1:56:51.040]  That's what the HPV does.
[1:56:51.040 --> 1:56:55.120]  They just start bleeding everywhere, and they go, oh, it's not the shot, honey, we got a
[1:56:55.120 --> 1:56:58.760]  nice coffin for you now.
[1:56:58.760 --> 1:56:59.760]  It's all just covered up.
[1:56:59.760 --> 1:57:04.720]  There's all these people dying, it's no big deal, and they test how to sell it, how many
[1:57:04.720 --> 1:57:07.760]  they can get away with without it breaking into the news.
[1:57:07.760 --> 1:57:08.760]  How much we'll put up with it?
[1:57:08.760 --> 1:57:11.000]  They're like, God, these slaves will put up with anything.
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  Hit them, hit them hard.
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:17.000]  They're like, aye, aye, captain, launch operation eugenics.
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:19.400]  There is enough evidence that suggests about 500 cases.
[1:57:19.400 --> 1:57:28.000]  Not a whitewash of Gillian's-Marais syndrome resulting in death from severe pulmonary complications.
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:31.320]  And it goes on in the vaccine reaction.
[1:57:31.320 --> 1:57:34.120]  Other influenza vaccines have not been linked to Gillian-Marais.
[1:57:34.120 --> 1:57:35.120]  What a lie.
[1:57:35.120 --> 1:57:37.320]  So you got all the lies in here.
[1:57:37.320 --> 1:57:41.360]  That said, why it's popped up again.
[1:57:41.360 --> 1:57:43.520]  Where is that in my stack?
[1:57:43.520 --> 1:57:44.880]  I just had that.
[1:57:44.880 --> 1:57:47.080]  Oh, here it is.
[1:57:47.080 --> 1:57:52.080]  Yeah, I also have the Washington Post, you can go read this article admitting how massive
[1:57:52.080 --> 1:57:59.760]  the deaths were, shot in the dark, swine flu vaccine lessons.
[1:57:59.760 --> 1:58:08.960]  And it gets into all the people that died when the CDC told the public to take the swine
[1:58:08.960 --> 1:58:09.960]  flu shot.
[1:58:09.960 --> 1:58:11.360]  So you can go read that there.
[1:58:11.360 --> 1:58:13.160]  And then here's the new one.
[1:58:13.160 --> 1:58:21.240]  This is out of Reuters, U.S. officials track new strain of flu.
[1:58:21.240 --> 1:58:26.600]  A new type of swine flu is infected at least two children in California.
[1:58:26.600 --> 1:58:30.400]  And while both have recovered, U.S. health officials said Tuesday they are looking for
[1:58:30.400 --> 1:58:31.400]  more cases.
[1:58:31.400 --> 1:58:35.880]  They say it's possible the children were infected by other people and not by pigs.
[1:58:35.880 --> 1:58:37.880]  We'll tell you about this when we get back.
[1:58:37.880 --> 1:58:39.880]  Stay with us.
[1:58:39.880 --> 1:58:54.880]  Hello, friends, this is Alex Jones, I've told you for a long time it's important to
[1:58:54.880 --> 1:58:55.880]  be self-sufficient.
[1:58:55.880 --> 1:58:57.680]  And today that's more important than ever.
[1:58:57.680 --> 1:59:00.680]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[1:59:00.680 --> 1:59:03.480]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your own bread.
[1:59:03.480 --> 1:59:07.480]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[1:59:07.480 --> 1:59:09.760]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare.
[1:59:09.760 --> 1:59:13.000]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation with you.
[1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:17.400]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli,
[1:59:17.400 --> 1:59:21.080]  salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports, and they do it at almost half the
[1:59:21.080 --> 1:59:23.320]  cost of last year's grocery prices.

[1:59:46.120 --> 1:59:47.120]  Take action today.
[1:59:47.120 --> 1:59:54.000]  The first step is getting storable food.
[1:59:54.000 --> 1:59:56.120]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:59:56.120 --> 2:00:05.600]  Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[2:00:05.600 --> 2:00:10.400]  Mike Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:00:10.400 --> 2:00:11.400]  You want answers?
[2:00:11.400 --> 2:00:13.600]  Well, so does he.
[2:00:13.600 --> 2:00:17.720]  He's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[2:00:17.720 --> 2:00:25.400]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:25.400 --> 2:00:31.920]  Please don't forget that Bayer Pharmaceutical shipped out over a million amp-hills of factor
[2:00:31.920 --> 2:00:39.080]  rate on HIV and hepatitis in every shot guaranteeing a death sentence to all those who took it worldwide.
[2:00:39.080 --> 2:00:42.400]  They came out in court documents.
[2:00:42.400 --> 2:00:44.080]  They knew it.
[2:00:44.080 --> 2:00:47.280]  They did it on purpose.
[2:00:47.280 --> 2:00:52.280]  And the federal courts in the U.S. said that they are immune because they're doing important
[2:00:52.280 --> 2:00:55.040]  eugenics work on you and your family.
[2:00:55.040 --> 2:01:01.880]  Then we got Baxter Pharmaceutical ordering 18 subsidiaries to mix live bird flu.
[2:01:01.880 --> 2:01:06.480]  With different groups and strains of regular human flu.
[2:01:06.480 --> 2:01:11.200]  And then to inject it into bodies so it could perfectly mutate.
[2:01:11.200 --> 2:01:16.280]  And then they're running around deaths are happening all over Europe, Poland, Germany,
[2:01:16.280 --> 2:01:17.280]  Czech Republic.
[2:01:17.280 --> 2:01:18.880]  And the news will never say what company is doing it.
[2:01:18.880 --> 2:01:22.960]  But it says pharmaceutical companies come to the local health department and say, tell
[2:01:22.960 --> 2:01:27.600]  your homeless this is a flu shot and pay them a couple hundred euros to take it.
[2:01:27.600 --> 2:01:28.600]  They take it.
[2:01:28.600 --> 2:01:29.600]  It kills them dead in a hammer.
[2:01:29.600 --> 2:01:30.600]  They're dying all over the place.
[2:01:30.600 --> 2:01:33.440]  It's mainstream news and they just go, ah, people are dying.
[2:01:33.440 --> 2:01:36.840]  Move along, move along, move along, move along.
[2:01:36.840 --> 2:01:42.760]  Folks, this criminal government, this global government has done tens of thousands of admitted
[2:01:42.760 --> 2:01:43.760]  tests.
[2:01:43.760 --> 2:01:46.840]  Thousands in the U.S. government on troops, citizens, foster kids, anybody they get their
[2:01:46.840 --> 2:01:49.840]  hands on, they get caught never getting in trouble.
[2:01:49.840 --> 2:01:52.600]  Now, you're going to trust them to take the shots.
[2:01:52.600 --> 2:01:53.600]  I know you are.
[2:01:53.600 --> 2:01:54.600]  You love them.
[2:01:54.600 --> 2:01:57.080]  Well, if that's what you want, go ahead.
[2:01:57.080 --> 2:01:58.840]  But anyways, they'll keep us safe.
[2:01:58.840 --> 2:01:59.840]  Don't worry.
[2:01:59.840 --> 2:02:00.840]  What's going on?
[2:02:00.840 --> 2:02:03.880]  U.S. officials track new flu strain.
[2:02:03.880 --> 2:02:08.000]  They say it's possible that children were infected by other people and not by pigs.
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:12.080]  And they say they have consulted with health officials in Canada, Mexico and the World
[2:02:12.080 --> 2:02:17.200]  Health Organization, or the World Eugenics Organization at the UN, although there is
[2:02:17.200 --> 2:02:22.120]  no evidence that the new virus is circulating widely.
[2:02:22.120 --> 2:02:27.080]  In a special alert, the CDC has doctors in California, San Diego and Imperial counties
[2:02:27.080 --> 2:02:32.680]  on the border with Mexico to test anyone with flu-like symptoms and send the samples in
[2:02:32.680 --> 2:02:33.840]  for testing.
[2:02:33.840 --> 2:02:36.240]  They're guaranteed testing what they've been doing to people.
[2:02:36.240 --> 2:02:41.720]  Because they like to test weaker soft kills first before they really, really go after
[2:02:41.720 --> 2:02:42.720]  you.
[2:02:42.720 --> 2:02:47.800]  Both of these kids came to our attention because they were seen in clinics, which do routine
[2:02:47.800 --> 2:02:52.760]  surveillance for influenza infections, special clinics.
[2:02:52.760 --> 2:02:58.120]  The CDC's Dr. Lynn Finale told reporters in the telephone briefing, neither child, a
[2:02:58.120 --> 2:03:01.840]  10-year-old boy or a 9-year-old girl had especially severe symptoms, although the girl
[2:03:01.840 --> 2:03:04.760]  had a fever 104 degrees, he said.
[2:03:04.760 --> 2:03:08.520]  We are not making the assumption that there are widespread infections out there and there
[2:03:08.520 --> 2:03:11.880]  is not any action that the public should take right now.
[2:03:11.880 --> 2:03:18.960]  The influenza strain, H1N1, the same family as the one of seasonal flu viruses now circulating,
[2:03:18.960 --> 2:03:24.440]  showed that genetically resembles a virus found in pigs and not in people.
[2:03:24.440 --> 2:03:27.080]  Officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, and see it was
[2:03:27.080 --> 2:03:32.600]  that one last time that killed tens of millions, it has never been seen before, the CDC said.
[2:03:32.600 --> 2:03:37.920]  Neither child had any contact with pigs, the source of infection is unknown, they added,
[2:03:37.920 --> 2:03:41.960]  the lack of known exposure to pigs and the two cases increases, the possibility that
[2:03:41.960 --> 2:03:49.480]  human-to-human transmission of this new influenza virus has occurred.
[2:03:49.480 --> 2:03:54.480]  So I just thought, give me some background, you know, when you see a Reuters story about
[2:03:54.480 --> 2:03:59.280]  bird flu or pig flu and the World Health Organization is going to save you and the Rockefeller
[2:03:59.280 --> 2:04:03.220]  Foundation is going to save you, I like to go back and tell you where this stuff pops
[2:04:03.220 --> 2:04:06.560]  up and who's behind it and what's going on.
[2:04:06.560 --> 2:04:10.200]  So at least, you know, if they go ahead and release it and you and your family are dying,
[2:04:10.200 --> 2:04:15.800]  you can at least know who did it to you, you know, it's important to know, at least
[2:04:15.800 --> 2:04:22.080]  if it comes to that or maybe if you survive, you can warn folks, but I know you'll probably,
[2:04:22.080 --> 2:04:25.040]  some of you will probably actually ask for more injections if you survive, you know,
[2:04:25.040 --> 2:04:28.440]  it wipes your whole family out, you'll probably go ask for more injections and then that'll
[2:04:28.440 --> 2:04:31.280]  kill you, but I mean, that's what it's all about, isn't it?
[2:04:31.280 --> 2:04:35.760]  I mean, you know, you let them fear monger you through their fear and then you run out
[2:04:35.760 --> 2:04:39.360]  and roll your sleeves up and say, oh, you've done all these thousands of tests killing
[2:04:39.360 --> 2:04:43.240]  people and secret programs in the past through vaccines and other operations.
[2:04:43.240 --> 2:04:44.840]  Oh, eject me.
[2:04:44.840 --> 2:04:45.840]  Please it makes perfect sense.
[2:04:45.840 --> 2:04:49.920]  We're going to go live at prisonplanet.tv after this break.
[2:04:49.920 --> 2:04:53.720]  Start taking your phone calls and a lot more got a ton of news I haven't even gotten to
[2:04:53.720 --> 2:04:54.720]  yet.
[2:04:54.720 --> 2:04:55.720]  We'll cover it as well.
[2:04:55.720 --> 2:04:56.720]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:04:56.720 --> 2:05:01.400]  This is the info war.
[2:05:01.400 --> 2:05:06.120]  Did you know many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground
[2:05:06.120 --> 2:05:07.440]  up shells?
[2:05:07.440 --> 2:05:11.240]  Think about that, would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[2:05:11.240 --> 2:05:14.320]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[2:05:14.320 --> 2:05:19.480]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Choose for Health, a delicious tasting
[2:05:19.480 --> 2:05:24.680]  chewable dietary supplement derived from 16 fruits, vegetables and antioxidants.

[2:05:29.160 --> 2:05:30.480]  better digestion.
[2:05:30.480 --> 2:05:31.960]  The choice is yours.
[2:05:31.960 --> 2:05:35.960]  Swallow rocks and shells to supplement your diet or a natural chewable product you can

[2:06:01.880 --> 2:06:07.960]  On the New World Order's War Against Humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:06:07.960 --> 2:06:12.480]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[2:06:12.480 --> 2:06:13.800]  us would like to see.
[2:06:13.800 --> 2:06:18.960]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[2:06:18.960 --> 2:06:20.360]  of the American people.
[2:06:20.360 --> 2:06:24.720]  While Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[2:06:24.720 --> 2:06:29.840]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[2:06:29.840 --> 2:06:37.920]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[2:06:37.920 --> 2:06:41.480]  It's not about left to right, it's about a one-world government.
[2:06:41.480 --> 2:06:48.400]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[2:06:48.400 --> 2:06:53.960]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high

[2:07:00.880 --> 2:07:05.440]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare
[2:07:05.440 --> 2:07:09.640]  with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[2:07:09.640 --> 2:07:14.760]  At hempusa.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and
[2:07:14.760 --> 2:07:15.760]  Canada.
[2:07:15.760 --> 2:07:20.440]  At hempusa.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is
[2:07:20.440 --> 2:07:22.720]  certified THC-free.
[2:07:22.720 --> 2:07:26.280]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[2:07:26.280 --> 2:07:28.640]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[2:07:32.800 --> 2:07:35.240]  affordably to be used as a storeable food.

[2:08:20.620 --> 2:08:33.580]  No one knows what it's like to be hated, to be faded, to telling only lies.
[2:08:33.580 --> 2:08:39.100]  Some fly has been flying around there for like a week, just laying it on my nose.
[2:08:39.100 --> 2:08:40.700]  I'm getting really sick of it.
[2:08:40.700 --> 2:08:46.380]  I've been harassing Burmese at night here, nine to midnight, dude.
[2:08:46.380 --> 2:08:50.140]  It's okay, you guys don't have to come in here and go after it.
[2:08:50.140 --> 2:08:59.860]  All right, I promised to get the EU closest climate loophole on air conditioners, got
[2:08:59.860 --> 2:09:01.420]  to ban those.
[2:09:01.420 --> 2:09:05.620]  Taxes on people that are overweight, Burmese has ran up with a bunch of articles, England
[2:09:05.620 --> 2:09:10.180]  said they want to chop their population in half through eugenics, mainstream news, Australia's
[2:09:10.180 --> 2:09:16.380]  now announced it, and they're simultaneously announcing domestic police states and domestic
[2:09:16.380 --> 2:09:17.380]  stasi.
[2:09:17.380 --> 2:09:21.260]  He's going to be sitting in for like 20 minutes before Judge Napolitano joins me, because
[2:09:21.260 --> 2:09:26.540]  I've got to go on international television for the next 15, 20 minutes of the next hour,
[2:09:26.540 --> 2:09:30.020]  then I'll come back in with Napolitano.
[2:09:30.020 --> 2:09:32.900]  We had to move him back 15, 20 minutes.
[2:09:32.900 --> 2:09:37.860]  Everybody has these crazy schedules, but we'll see what happens with that.
[2:09:37.860 --> 2:09:38.860]  So that is coming up.
[2:09:38.860 --> 2:09:41.980]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to your calls.
[2:09:41.980 --> 2:09:44.500]  Corey in Colorado, you're on the air.
[2:09:44.500 --> 2:09:46.620]  Hey, how are you doing?
[2:09:46.620 --> 2:09:47.620]  Very good, sir.
[2:09:47.620 --> 2:09:48.620]  Great.
[2:09:48.620 --> 2:09:52.860]  Well, I had a quick thing to talk about, really quick, about the global warming and how it's
[2:09:52.860 --> 2:09:54.460]  so, you know, it's killing us all.
[2:09:54.460 --> 2:09:59.620]  But I just recently looked up an article about an ice shelf in Antarctica.
[2:09:59.620 --> 2:10:01.620]  They, I guess it just fell off the roof.
[2:10:01.620 --> 2:10:03.420]  Jimmy, if you were to turn your radio off.
[2:10:03.420 --> 2:10:04.420]  Yeah, sure.
[2:10:04.420 --> 2:10:05.420]  Sorry.
[2:10:05.420 --> 2:10:09.100]  Because it just, it really makes it hard to listen to you, and then we don't get to focus
[2:10:09.100 --> 2:10:10.100]  on what you're saying.
[2:10:10.100 --> 2:10:11.100]  Are you there?
[2:10:11.100 --> 2:10:12.100]  Yeah.
[2:10:12.100 --> 2:10:13.100]  Yes, we're here.
[2:10:13.100 --> 2:10:14.100]  Go ahead.
[2:10:14.100 --> 2:10:17.780]  So, talks about a ice shelf in Antarctica.
[2:10:17.780 --> 2:10:24.980]  It's like hundreds of miles long and it has a clean cut, as if it was cut by something
[2:10:24.980 --> 2:10:30.100]  I had, you know, about the airborne lasers on bowings and stuff like that.
[2:10:30.100 --> 2:10:31.100]  Yeah.
[2:10:31.100 --> 2:10:32.100]  No, those are declassified.
[2:10:32.100 --> 2:10:35.740]  The whole plane's a laser, I mean, has a giant laser that goes the length of it.
[2:10:35.740 --> 2:10:40.900]  It's a chemical laser, a chemical particle beam, but a lot of times ice does break off
[2:10:40.900 --> 2:10:42.020]  in clean sheets.
[2:10:42.020 --> 2:10:46.500]  And Antarctica and the Arctic is always getting smaller in the summer, bigger in the winter.
[2:10:46.500 --> 2:10:47.500]  It just got bigger.
[2:10:47.500 --> 2:10:53.420]  It got 31% bigger in the north and the south, record increase in its size because the sun
[2:10:53.420 --> 2:10:56.100]  cooled off the last two years.
[2:10:56.100 --> 2:11:00.580]  And I think what, what I think is happening is, I mean, this is for hundreds of miles.
[2:11:00.580 --> 2:11:02.580]  This is a ice, you know, clean, clean.
[2:11:02.580 --> 2:11:06.540]  It looks like a, it just totally looks like somebody just cut out with a bulldozer for
[2:11:06.540 --> 2:11:07.540]  miles and miles.
[2:11:07.540 --> 2:11:08.540]  But I mean,
[2:11:08.540 --> 2:11:11.140]  I just don't think those chemical lasers have that much power.
[2:11:11.140 --> 2:11:16.380]  Well, it's also a theory on also the, if there's any satellite-based lasers, I mean,
[2:11:16.380 --> 2:11:17.980]  it's just, it's just something that, you know,
[2:11:17.980 --> 2:11:21.540]  Well, I mean, there's a lot of suppressed technology, I just stick with what I can prove.
[2:11:21.540 --> 2:11:22.540]  Right.
[2:11:22.540 --> 2:11:23.540]  I agree.
[2:11:23.540 --> 2:11:24.540]  Yeah.
[2:11:24.540 --> 2:11:27.660]  That just kind of sparked my attention, but I also wanted to talk about the Tea Party
[2:11:27.660 --> 2:11:32.300]  last week and I was out there, I handed out a bunch of over a hundred Obama deceptions
[2:11:32.300 --> 2:11:34.540]  in my 15 minutes.
[2:11:34.540 --> 2:11:40.260]  And I also, there was a, there was a provocateur, the police undercover, he actually filmed
[2:11:40.260 --> 2:11:45.140]  me and I was a, you know, spilling my deal on, on Liberty and you know, he, he was taught,
[2:11:45.140 --> 2:11:47.380]  we had a flag and he says, why don't you go burn that flag?
[2:11:47.380 --> 2:11:48.580]  You guys are a bunch of socialists.
[2:11:48.580 --> 2:11:49.580]  Why are you even here?
[2:11:49.580 --> 2:11:51.820]  Why are you wasting your time arguing about this stuff?
[2:11:51.820 --> 2:11:52.820]  You guys are a bunch of socialists.
[2:11:52.820 --> 2:11:53.820]  Go start a riot.
[2:11:53.820 --> 2:11:54.820]  Go start a riot.
[2:11:54.820 --> 2:11:56.180]  You know, filming me on this.
[2:11:56.180 --> 2:12:00.540]  And I was just like, you know, man, I'm here for Liberty and the flag, I represent this
[2:12:00.540 --> 2:12:01.540]  flag.
[2:12:01.540 --> 2:12:02.540]  The flag right now is undercorrected.
[2:12:02.540 --> 2:12:03.980]  Well, he's threatened by freedom.
[2:12:03.980 --> 2:12:04.980]  He's a parasite.
[2:12:04.980 --> 2:12:09.100]  He believes in the state and the government and, but I hope you send me that footage because
[2:12:09.100 --> 2:12:12.260]  I want to put some of that in the new Obama film I'm making.
[2:12:12.260 --> 2:12:16.860]  I'm, I'm actually, I'm, I'm stocking up on footage on, you know, stuff, uh, protest
[2:12:16.860 --> 2:12:17.860]  stuff like that.
[2:12:17.860 --> 2:12:20.860]  And also, I'm doing a lot of footage on your, on chemtrails and all that stuff.
[2:12:20.860 --> 2:12:24.380]  And I'm going to be sending a lot of good, don't forget, don't forget, mail it to us
[2:12:24.380 --> 2:12:25.380]  right now.
[2:12:25.380 --> 2:12:26.380]  Okay.
[2:12:26.380 --> 2:12:27.380]  All right.
[2:12:27.380 --> 2:12:28.380]  I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll get on that.
[2:12:28.380 --> 2:12:29.380]  I'll definitely do that for you.
[2:12:29.380 --> 2:12:30.380]  Yeah.
[2:12:30.380 --> 2:12:31.380]  Don't wait and not get it done.
[2:12:31.380 --> 2:12:32.380]  Thank you so much.
[2:12:32.380 --> 2:12:33.380]  Appreciate the call.
[2:12:33.380 --> 2:12:34.380]  You bet.
[2:12:34.380 --> 2:12:35.380]  Let's talk to Steve in Georgia.
[2:12:35.380 --> 2:12:36.380]  Steve, you're on the air.
[2:12:36.380 --> 2:12:37.380]  Go ahead.
[2:12:37.380 --> 2:12:38.380]  Hey, Alex.
[2:12:38.380 --> 2:12:42.940]  Hey, I just asked you to be kind with me because I did have an experimental, uh, fluoride treatment
[2:12:42.940 --> 2:12:44.340]  back in 1963.
[2:12:44.340 --> 2:12:45.860]  So hopefully I'm coherent.
[2:12:45.860 --> 2:12:46.860]  Okay.
[2:12:46.860 --> 2:12:47.860]  Those are the first grade.
[2:12:47.860 --> 2:12:49.460]  Oh, actually, where's that photo of me?
[2:12:49.460 --> 2:12:51.100]  I said I was going to show that.
[2:12:51.100 --> 2:12:53.100]  Where's the photo of where I'm getting the fluoride treatment?
[2:12:53.100 --> 2:12:54.100]  It's around here somewhere.
[2:12:54.100 --> 2:12:55.100]  Go ahead.
[2:12:55.100 --> 2:12:56.100]  No, no.
[2:12:56.100 --> 2:12:57.100]  Here I am.
[2:12:57.100 --> 2:12:59.380]  We found a photo of where I'm getting a fluoride treatment.
[2:12:59.380 --> 2:13:00.380]  Go ahead.
[2:13:00.380 --> 2:13:01.380]  That's funny.
[2:13:01.380 --> 2:13:02.380]  That was back in the first grade.
[2:13:02.380 --> 2:13:07.260]  I still remember the taste and the instructions and the two cold chairs and the two nurses
[2:13:07.260 --> 2:13:09.300]  in a grade school being given that treatment.
[2:13:09.300 --> 2:13:10.980]  I still understand why I got it.
[2:13:10.980 --> 2:13:15.460]  Anyway, I've got a combat zone field report for you, uh, just north of Atlanta.
[2:13:15.460 --> 2:13:20.260]  Uh, I really think the minions of tyranny are literally going to come to my front door
[2:13:20.260 --> 2:13:22.540]  and it's going to be in the next two days.
[2:13:22.540 --> 2:13:23.540]  I got a note.
[2:13:23.540 --> 2:13:29.020]  I live in a, uh, about 400 home subdivision north of Atlanta.
[2:13:29.020 --> 2:13:34.420]  And I got a note from my homeowner's association indicating that a census worker would be stopping
[2:13:34.420 --> 2:13:36.420]  by my home.
[2:13:36.420 --> 2:13:39.380]  And, and, and what it reads, can I say the census worker's name?
[2:13:39.380 --> 2:13:40.380]  I guess I can.
[2:13:40.380 --> 2:13:45.340]  Anyway, the note, the note says, census worker, Mr. Wallerstein is in the community to verify
[2:13:45.340 --> 2:13:48.340]  street addresses for the next day or so.
[2:13:48.340 --> 2:13:55.380]  Mr. Wallerstein will have to take a GPS signal close to the front doors on a handheld computer
[2:13:55.380 --> 2:13:57.380]  to form this task.
[2:13:57.380 --> 2:13:58.380]  Okay.
[2:13:58.380 --> 2:14:03.420]  So, you know, I've been listening to you for a while, this is coming home right now.
[2:14:03.420 --> 2:14:04.420]  There's no.
[2:14:04.420 --> 2:14:07.420]  Well, you know, I mean, do you know what, uh, your zip code is?
[2:14:07.420 --> 2:14:14.460]  Yeah, it's a GPS, you know, whatever, uh, originally it's a Pentagon artillery air strike
[2:14:14.460 --> 2:14:15.940]  coordination code.
[2:14:15.940 --> 2:14:16.940]  Right.
[2:14:16.940 --> 2:14:17.940]  That's a fact.
[2:14:17.940 --> 2:14:18.940]  Right.
[2:14:18.940 --> 2:14:21.100]  Uh, and, and then the added number on the end of it is the full code.
[2:14:21.100 --> 2:14:25.100]  And then they now have the GPS system and under law, they're only allowed to ask how
[2:14:25.100 --> 2:14:26.100]  many people live there.
[2:14:26.100 --> 2:14:27.100]  Exactly.
[2:14:27.100 --> 2:14:28.100]  Okay.
[2:14:28.100 --> 2:14:32.100]  But, but now most people are getting 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, some 100 question ones.
[2:14:32.100 --> 2:14:34.700]  Um, what, how many guns do you own?
[2:14:34.700 --> 2:14:37.620]  Uh, they're asking, uh, how much money do you have?
[2:14:37.620 --> 2:14:41.180]  What type of toilet do you have training you and they'll bang on the door, happen to me
[2:14:41.180 --> 2:14:42.700]  and they'll go answer my question.
[2:14:42.700 --> 2:14:44.660]  And I said, listen, get off my property.
[2:14:44.660 --> 2:14:46.340]  I'm going to call the police pal.
[2:14:46.340 --> 2:14:47.340]  They did, they did the same thing to me.
[2:14:47.340 --> 2:14:48.340]  That type of thing.
[2:14:48.340 --> 2:14:51.820]  But my issue is they're taking a GPS signal of my front door.
[2:14:51.820 --> 2:14:52.820]  Okay.
[2:14:52.820 --> 2:14:54.860]  So I, I'm going to escort again.
[2:14:54.860 --> 2:14:59.620]  They, they made a mistake because they let me know and I've alerted all my neighbors.
[2:14:59.620 --> 2:15:02.740]  You know, escort this guy off your property nicely.
[2:15:02.740 --> 2:15:04.060]  Tell him never to come back.
[2:15:04.060 --> 2:15:07.260]  I mean, it's a, he can't come on my property, right?
[2:15:07.260 --> 2:15:13.060]  It's not, well, you, you, you, you must have, well, you probably waived your rights under
[2:15:13.060 --> 2:15:15.340]  the homeowners association rule.
[2:15:15.340 --> 2:15:21.700]  So through a contract, if their contract says that, uh, he can I don't, I don't know if
[2:15:21.700 --> 2:15:22.700]  it would have been in there.
[2:15:22.700 --> 2:15:24.980]  I mean, this neighbor has been around for about 30 years.
[2:15:24.980 --> 2:15:25.980]  I don't know.
[2:15:25.980 --> 2:15:29.580]  But you have to look at the, you have to look at the covenant and a lot of times when
[2:15:29.580 --> 2:15:33.940]  they change stuff, they'll say by paying your, your yearly dues, you agree to the new rules
[2:15:33.940 --> 2:15:34.940]  of the covenant.
[2:15:34.940 --> 2:15:38.660]  If you'd like to see that talk to the man, you know, talk to the homeowners association
[2:15:38.660 --> 2:15:44.140]  manager bill who steals half the money, you know, that's what they usually do, but you
[2:15:44.140 --> 2:15:46.340]  can go find out there more about it.
[2:15:46.340 --> 2:15:49.580]  But no, I mean, this is, this is, this is literally control.
[2:15:49.580 --> 2:15:53.780]  And so that's so SWAT team guys in the dark, you know, or foreign troops, whatever, which
[2:15:53.780 --> 2:15:55.820]  they now admit they're going to use foreign troops in America.
[2:15:55.820 --> 2:15:56.820]  It's now mainstream news.
[2:15:56.820 --> 2:16:03.340]  They're like, any, any, any, any, any, any, they're just like, I'm like, I can't feel
[2:16:03.340 --> 2:16:04.340]  it.
[2:16:04.340 --> 2:16:07.340]  And they're just like running right up to your door with the SWAT teams or they can
[2:16:07.340 --> 2:16:08.340]  send their robots.
[2:16:08.340 --> 2:16:12.980]  I've got that in Reuters, hunter killer robots, 18 wheelers, pull up that are robotic.
[2:16:12.980 --> 2:16:18.420]  The hunter killer Swords offload and then you come right up to your door.
[2:16:18.420 --> 2:16:19.420]  That's what it's all about.
[2:16:19.420 --> 2:16:20.420]  It's all about the freedom.
[2:16:20.420 --> 2:16:21.420]  People think I'm joking about that.
[2:16:21.420 --> 2:16:22.420]  It's, it's serious.
[2:16:22.420 --> 2:16:25.620]  No, Steve Quill talked about the orange alert on your show the other day or whatever.
[2:16:25.620 --> 2:16:29.660]  And I was wondering, you know, how are they going to round up a bunch of special ops guys?
[2:16:29.660 --> 2:16:31.460]  You know, are they going to do it one day at a time?
[2:16:31.460 --> 2:16:32.460]  That isn't going to work.
[2:16:32.460 --> 2:16:35.620]  They're going to have some, they're going to send people via GPS signals.
[2:16:35.620 --> 2:16:37.700]  They're not even going to mess with the dresses.
[2:16:37.700 --> 2:16:38.700]  Oh, you're right.
[2:16:38.700 --> 2:16:40.300]  In fact, and oh, great, great point.
[2:16:40.300 --> 2:16:41.300]  And I appreciate your call.
[2:16:41.300 --> 2:16:43.180]  Let me just add this.
[2:16:43.180 --> 2:16:52.780]  I remember again, 16, 17 years ago, Alexander Hague, big globalist had a cable TV show that
[2:16:52.780 --> 2:16:53.980]  aired around the country.
[2:16:53.980 --> 2:16:59.220]  He would pay to have it aired on county cable channels and I would sit there.
[2:16:59.220 --> 2:17:03.020]  My last year in high school, I was here in Austin and I would watch Alexander Hague when
[2:17:03.020 --> 2:17:07.980]  I got home about six o'clock after working out after school.
[2:17:07.980 --> 2:17:11.820]  And he said, we're going to have these huge blimp solar powered surveilling all the cities.
[2:17:11.820 --> 2:17:14.420]  They're much cheaper than satellites and they're below the cloud cover.
[2:17:14.420 --> 2:17:21.460]  They work much better or they're below, you know, the atmospheric zone at about 90,000
[2:17:21.460 --> 2:17:22.460]  feet.
[2:17:22.460 --> 2:17:27.180]  And he was explaining all of this and then I saw documents later and then now they admit
[2:17:27.180 --> 2:17:33.580]  they have big blimps at 95,000 feet surveilling, scanning, reading, ground penetrating radar,
[2:17:33.580 --> 2:17:38.180]  face scanning cameras, heat signature cameras that track you off your heat signature, you
[2:17:38.180 --> 2:17:41.820]  know, they get a heat signature on the ground from you with your name ID.
[2:17:41.820 --> 2:17:43.820]  Like, like they can have a camera aimed.
[2:17:43.820 --> 2:17:48.420]  In fact, they admit they have the MIT Braggs, they have these integration systems.
[2:17:48.420 --> 2:17:50.060]  Here's how it works.
[2:17:50.060 --> 2:17:51.060]  This is one way it works.
[2:17:51.060 --> 2:18:00.340]  Now, a camera that scans your driver's license, well, it ties your face, your digital face
[2:18:00.340 --> 2:18:03.820]  with the digital driver's license photo.
[2:18:03.820 --> 2:18:09.780]  Now the camera scans your license plate and ties that to your driver's license database.
[2:18:09.780 --> 2:18:16.060]  The same camera, the same computers then matches your face getting out of the car.
[2:18:16.060 --> 2:18:17.540]  You understand how this works?
[2:18:17.540 --> 2:18:20.340]  Hey guys, can you keep it down out there?
[2:18:20.340 --> 2:18:23.740]  Okay, let's not have big discussions right outside because I'm trying to think here,
[2:18:23.740 --> 2:18:25.420]  I'm trying to keep focused, okay?
[2:18:25.420 --> 2:18:29.620]  Did they even hear me or are they just going to keep going on outside the door?
[2:18:29.620 --> 2:18:31.940]  Sir, hold on just a minute.
[2:18:31.940 --> 2:18:33.820]  Is that same caller still there?
[2:18:33.820 --> 2:18:35.940]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[2:18:35.940 --> 2:18:36.940]  Okay.
[2:18:36.940 --> 2:18:43.100]  I got so much going on in my head, I just can't keep track of this anymore and I know the
[2:18:43.100 --> 2:18:45.620]  caller had more he wanted to say that was actually a new caller.
[2:18:45.620 --> 2:18:47.140]  You can call back in if you can get in, sir.
[2:18:47.140 --> 2:18:48.340]  I just can't do it.
[2:18:48.340 --> 2:18:52.860]  I mean, because what happens is I start listening from radio to what people are doing and they
[2:18:52.860 --> 2:18:56.980]  get right outside the door and have really loud discussions and then it totally short
[2:18:56.980 --> 2:18:58.940]  circuits what I'm thinking and what I'm saying.
[2:18:58.940 --> 2:19:00.180]  Let me try to start over.
[2:19:00.180 --> 2:19:04.460]  Okay, I'm going to start over right now for folks on air.
[2:19:04.460 --> 2:19:07.980]  What they do is they have your digital photo from when you get the driver's license.
[2:19:07.980 --> 2:19:12.380]  Then they have cameras that are also reading your car license plate.
[2:19:12.380 --> 2:19:14.860]  And so that's a secondary way to ID you.
[2:19:14.860 --> 2:19:18.860]  When you get out of the car, the face scanning camera on the ground, designed and put in
[2:19:18.860 --> 2:19:26.420]  by DARPA, IDs your digital photo with the face scan off of the database they have, ties
[2:19:26.420 --> 2:19:30.940]  it in with the car and the license plate confirming that's you.
[2:19:30.940 --> 2:19:38.860]  Then when they're wanting to track a subject, the blimp has your infrared signature and
[2:19:38.860 --> 2:19:43.740]  the cameras on the ground nexus that that's your ID and then it takes a reading of your
[2:19:43.740 --> 2:19:46.780]  heat resonance and then now it's in the database.
[2:19:46.780 --> 2:19:51.340]  And so the blimps are just constantly getting new subjects tracking, getting all of this
[2:19:51.340 --> 2:19:55.900]  up there so they know where you're at, what you're doing and then they have the GPS coordinates
[2:19:55.900 --> 2:19:56.900]  of your front door.
[2:19:56.900 --> 2:20:01.420]  When we come back, I'll cover Reuters for you so we can go with that.
[2:20:01.420 --> 2:20:05.700]  If you have over $10,000 in credit card debt, you need to hear this.
[2:20:05.700 --> 2:20:09.940]  Have you been watching the banks getting their bailout money and wondering where your relief
[2:20:09.940 --> 2:20:10.940]  is?
[2:20:10.940 --> 2:20:13.100]  The answer you're looking for is the bailout group.
[2:20:13.100 --> 2:20:18.660]  The bailout group has settled over $100 million in credit card debt for people just like you.
[2:20:18.660 --> 2:20:23.580]  The bailout group can help cut your debt by up to 60% of its original value, removing

[2:21:39.580 --> 2:21:57.620]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:21:57.620 --> 2:22:13.060]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[2:22:13.060 --> 2:22:15.060]  just as well funded.
[2:22:15.060 --> 2:22:20.220]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[2:22:20.220 --> 2:22:21.700]  of the American people.
[2:22:21.700 --> 2:22:26.100]  While Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[2:22:26.100 --> 2:22:31.180]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[2:22:31.180 --> 2:22:37.700]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:22:37.700 --> 2:22:41.260]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government.
[2:22:41.260 --> 2:22:48.180]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[2:22:53.740 --> 2:22:56.380]  quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:22:56.380 --> 2:23:01.460]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[2:23:01.460 --> 2:23:06.020]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol
[2:23:06.020 --> 2:23:10.340]  levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[2:23:10.340 --> 2:23:15.220]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[2:23:15.220 --> 2:23:18.780]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[2:23:18.780 --> 2:23:23.300]  Remember how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[2:23:23.300 --> 2:23:24.300]  across America.
[2:23:24.300 --> 2:23:28.300]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[2:23:28.300 --> 2:23:31.980]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[2:23:31.980 --> 2:23:32.980]  healthier I feel.
[2:23:32.980 --> 2:23:35.620]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[2:23:35.620 --> 2:23:40.860]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[2:23:40.860 --> 2:23:43.340]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[2:24:01.420 --> 2:24:13.900]  So bottom line, they have the blimps IDing everybody, they admit it and tracking everywhere
[2:24:13.900 --> 2:24:14.900]  you go.
[2:24:14.900 --> 2:24:19.900]  And the million plus people on the no fly list and the total control grid going into
[2:24:19.900 --> 2:24:20.900]  place right now.
[2:24:20.900 --> 2:24:28.420]  So I thought I'd get into this, they're converting the entire military, they've got 18 wheelers
[2:24:28.420 --> 2:24:33.460]  they admit that are robotic that can drive from one end of the country to the other and
[2:24:33.460 --> 2:24:34.460]  make decisions.
[2:24:34.460 --> 2:24:38.900]  But normally they have a controller who's also in there through the cameras in a simulator
[2:24:38.900 --> 2:24:40.620]  to take it over, there's a problem.
[2:24:40.620 --> 2:24:46.500]  It pulls up, the bottom lowers down, 15 killer robots get off and they just start murdering.
[2:24:46.500 --> 2:24:51.140]  This is Reuters today, Reuters, bigger than AP.
[2:24:51.140 --> 2:24:55.340]  Killer robots and a revolution in warfare.
[2:24:55.340 --> 2:24:56.340]  They have no fear.
[2:24:56.340 --> 2:24:57.340]  They never tire.
[2:24:57.340 --> 2:25:00.500]  They are not upset when the soldier next to them gets blown to pieces.
[2:25:00.500 --> 2:25:05.700]  The morale doesn't suffer by having to do anything and again their jobs known in the
[2:25:05.700 --> 2:25:09.820]  military as the 3Ds, dull, dirty and dangerous.
[2:25:09.820 --> 2:25:13.780]  They are military robots and they are rapidly increasing numbers and growing sophistication
[2:25:13.780 --> 2:25:19.140]  may herald the end of thousands of years of human monopoly on war fighting.
[2:25:19.140 --> 2:25:21.660]  Science fiction is moving to the battlefield.
[2:25:21.660 --> 2:25:27.820]  The future is upon us says Brookings scholar Peter Singer put it in a conference of experts
[2:25:27.820 --> 2:25:32.460]  at the U.S. Army War College of Pennsylvania this month and the entire air force attack
[2:25:32.460 --> 2:25:37.180]  craft everything is converting and I've seen the training drills I've seen and then I've
[2:25:37.180 --> 2:25:40.020]  talked to troops they say there's classified stuff you wouldn't believe I just don't want
[2:25:40.020 --> 2:25:44.940]  to scare the public and these even Fox News had a piece six, seven years ago I've got
[2:25:44.940 --> 2:25:48.700]  it somewhere on tape where it shows a little hovering flying saucer and it comes up and
[2:25:48.700 --> 2:25:56.820]  face scans you and if you don't show ID it kills you and so you see stuff like they live
[2:25:56.820 --> 2:26:02.420]  where it's hello my little friend I there you are you know he blasted I have come here
[2:26:02.420 --> 2:26:11.060]  to do two things to kick butts and chew bubblegum and I am all out of bubblegum oh man we're
[2:26:11.060 --> 2:26:15.380]  in a lot of trouble folks so that's what's happening and police departments around the
[2:26:15.380 --> 2:26:18.820]  world already sent in killer robots into quotes you won't come out of the house send in the
[2:26:18.820 --> 2:26:23.060]  killer robot and they're getting more and more they use them in Fallujah got their feet
[2:26:23.060 --> 2:26:29.060]  wet there a little bit of wet work but the globalists just don't care about the Arabs
[2:26:29.060 --> 2:26:37.980]  they love you they care about human life Singer published a for wired for war the robotics
[2:26:37.980 --> 2:26:42.940]  revolution and conflict 21st century a book that traces the rise of the machines and predicts
[2:26:42.940 --> 2:26:49.020]  that in the future wars they will not only play greater roles in executing missions but
[2:26:49.020 --> 2:26:55.500]  also in planning them numbers affect the explosive growth of robotic systems meanwhile the government
[2:26:55.500 --> 2:26:59.620]  wants our guns you know we're getting outgunned by them they want our guns just enjoy yourselves
[2:26:59.620 --> 2:27:04.860]  everybody now numbers reflect the explosive growth of robotic systems the US forces that
[2:27:04.860 --> 2:27:10.340]  stormed into Iraq in 2003 had no robots on the ground there were none of Afghanistan
[2:27:10.340 --> 2:27:16.460]  either now those two wars are fought with the help of an estimated 12,000 ground based
[2:27:16.460 --> 2:27:22.540]  robots and 7,000 unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs the technical term for drone or robotic
[2:27:22.540 --> 2:27:27.540]  aircraft ground based robots in Iraq have saved hundreds of lives in Iraq diffusing
[2:27:27.540 --> 2:27:32.940]  improvised explosive devices which account for more than 40% of US casualties the first
[2:27:32.940 --> 2:27:40.140]  armed robot was deployed in Iraq in 2007 and it is lethal as its acronym is long special
[2:27:40.140 --> 2:27:45.340]  weapons observation remote reconnaissance direct action system swords by the way they
[2:27:45.340 --> 2:27:51.700]  were used earlier than that but like they tell you we went into Vietnam in 1965 folks
[2:27:51.700 --> 2:27:58.780]  we were there in 1959 and 4,000 troops died as advisors they love lying to you just drink
[2:27:58.780 --> 2:28:05.100]  some more fluoride though remember they care about you continuing here it says the first
[2:28:05.100 --> 2:28:12.100]  armed robot was deployed in Iraq 2007 it's the Swords is mounted with a M249 machine
[2:28:12.100 --> 2:28:18.500]  gun can hit a target at 3,000 feet away with pinpoint precision from the air the best known
[2:28:18.500 --> 2:28:24.100]  UAV is the predator has killed dozens of insurgents dozens of insurgents every week they bomb
[2:28:24.100 --> 2:28:28.700]  another wedding and we killed 300 innocent people and might have killed one bad guy but
[2:28:28.700 --> 2:28:37.980]  they tell you here 12 it's all meant to minimize the slaves and I read the British Army documents
[2:28:37.980 --> 2:28:43.140]  on that they know they say we've killed thousands we say we've killed five and the human mind
[2:28:43.140 --> 2:28:46.100]  will automatically when they hear the real number later of thousands will average them
[2:28:46.100 --> 2:28:52.220]  together a little psych warfare thing just one of many psych warfare manuals that have
[2:28:52.220 --> 2:28:56.740]  been in class about I've read the predators are flown by operators sitting in front of
[2:28:56.740 --> 2:29:02.740]  television monitors and cubicles at Creek Air Force base in Nevada 8,000 miles away
[2:29:02.740 --> 2:29:07.260]  from Afghanistan yeah and this is how they work all these kids playing games slaughtering
[2:29:07.260 --> 2:29:11.420]  people designed by the Pentagon they admit they're being conditioned to not care about
[2:29:11.420 --> 2:29:15.860]  killing and so they just sit there with drones killing women and children it's all part of
[2:29:15.860 --> 2:29:19.580]  pleasure and they get off on it you know they feel good like their life means something
[2:29:19.580 --> 2:29:27.420]  I'm real manly you know I sit in a robot to kill somebody and don't worry police and

[2:31:15.860 --> 2:31:20.540]  destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people while
[2:31:20.540 --> 2:31:26.020]  Obama's already fudging yeah but since day one in this election if you have a demagogue

[2:33:12.140 --> 2:33:20.420]  yeah this article where it's getting into the robots gives dis info from the numbers
[2:33:20.420 --> 2:33:25.260]  I've seen it says robotics research and development and the US received a big push from Congress
[2:33:25.260 --> 2:33:31.380]  in 2001 when it set two ambitious goals by 2010 a third of the country's long range attack
[2:33:31.380 --> 2:33:38.440]  aircraft should be unmanned number I saw was half and by 2015 one third of America's ground
[2:33:38.440 --> 2:33:45.780]  combat vehicles you ought to see these things it's like well you can just Google combat robots
[2:33:45.780 --> 2:33:49.700]  and I mean it's like big black tanks they're like the size of a Chevy truck with like
[2:33:49.700 --> 2:33:54.980]  10 guns on the nose and nerve gas sprayers and everything else and this is what the cops
[2:33:54.980 --> 2:33:58.740]  are going to be using on you folks they're just going to go oh won't turn your guns
[2:33:58.740 --> 2:34:06.100]  in warwags start rolling that's why once they try to start all that you can't be in a defensive
[2:34:06.100 --> 2:34:10.620]  posture waiting for them and then you got to go to the factories the relay centers the
[2:34:10.620 --> 2:34:19.300]  places where they got these terminators set up it's really sick folks we got a psycho scientist
[2:34:19.300 --> 2:34:23.580]  eugenicist working for inbred bankers who believe in eugenics running everything and
[2:34:23.580 --> 2:34:28.180]  everything's a giant kill grid everything they're setting up to kill grid to slaughterhouse
[2:34:28.180 --> 2:34:33.140]  the new world order is setting up a giant slaughterhouse for humanity in their own words
[2:34:33.140 --> 2:34:38.020]  and they're practicing soft kills with the vaccines and the things they do but they're
[2:34:38.020 --> 2:34:42.860]  just expanding all of this let's go ahead and go back to your calls john and oregon
[2:34:42.860 --> 2:34:48.940]  go ahead hey alex how's it going good sir um i just actually um i wanted to bring up
[2:34:48.940 --> 2:34:53.420]  a couple things with you first off um as far as i know you don't have a problem with us
[2:34:53.420 --> 2:34:58.900]  downloading your movies off the internet for free correct no i want people to okay well
[2:34:58.900 --> 2:35:02.300]  i thought i'd let you know okay i use bit torrent i use a bit torrent client to download
[2:35:02.300 --> 2:35:06.340]  copier movies and um i thought i'd let you know that i was completely death pinged by
[2:35:06.340 --> 2:35:11.940]  the u.s. government tell my computer completely shut down i mean i have a couple different
[2:35:11.940 --> 2:35:15.900]  firewalls to let me uh... actually see the i p address of the people that i'm sharing
[2:35:15.900 --> 2:35:20.300]  with and uploading with and uh... several of them were uh... what is it a couple of
[2:35:20.300 --> 2:35:26.580]  them were uh... what is it f b i anti peer to peer and a couple of them and they uh...
[2:35:26.580 --> 2:35:30.940]  they pierce the uh... death ping my i p address so hard that my whole computer just shut down
[2:35:30.940 --> 2:35:36.900]  well we kept wondering why uh... the pirate bay and others would have it posted with thousands
[2:35:36.900 --> 2:35:41.340]  of cedars and people in the end and then pirate bay would take it down themselves
[2:35:41.340 --> 2:35:45.540]  and they're doing that because the film is the most viral film out there and there's
[2:35:45.540 --> 2:35:49.340]  a little short clips and things that are more viral like literally you know girls playing
[2:35:49.340 --> 2:35:54.660]  volleyball and bikinis but for a full film it's the most viral thing out there everywhere
[2:35:54.660 --> 2:36:00.140]  and uh... no i mean obama invited a blogger this is mainstream news for the white house
[2:36:00.140 --> 2:36:03.140]  that was mildly critical of him trying to co-opt them
[2:36:03.140 --> 2:36:07.100]  they are having to work at anderson's running national radio ads for the obama
[2:36:07.100 --> 2:36:08.060]  deception
[2:36:08.060 --> 2:36:12.460]  uh... you know major rap groups are plugging it you know that huge concerts
[2:36:12.460 --> 2:36:15.740]  and so yes they're trying to shut down the spread of it
[2:36:15.740 --> 2:36:18.180]  they also like the fear that creates so
[2:36:18.180 --> 2:36:21.620]  all you do is upload it ten times more and fight back
[2:36:21.620 --> 2:36:25.100]  uh... because because it shows you the banker cramming look i'm going on air
[2:36:25.100 --> 2:36:26.860]  saying arrest the bankers
[2:36:26.860 --> 2:36:30.300]  i am literally on the front lines going to shoot me
[2:36:30.300 --> 2:36:33.740]  and you know uh... because i'm not here to lose this fight
[2:36:33.740 --> 2:36:37.300]  i'm here to go head up against the enemy and i've asked people to give a
[2:36:37.300 --> 2:36:42.300]  support because you people realize we're big now and we are
[2:36:42.300 --> 2:36:45.700]  we know how to counter the globalist we are stepping up the play
[2:36:45.700 --> 2:36:48.780]  to their criminality these are people that'll murder whole third world
[2:36:48.780 --> 2:36:49.740]  countries
[2:36:49.740 --> 2:36:53.100]  that they don't care about life they just don't want to kill me
[2:36:53.100 --> 2:36:57.060]  and make me into a martyr so they're studying ways to destroy me in the media
[2:36:57.060 --> 2:36:58.420]  and other things
[2:36:58.420 --> 2:37:02.700]  and uh... you know i am literally uh... you know going in through and beyond i'm

[2:39:24.100 --> 2:39:26.700]  in winnipeg uh... matatoba
[2:39:26.700 --> 2:39:29.580]  there were aerosol tracer programs
[2:39:29.580 --> 2:39:30.820]  being used on
[2:39:30.820 --> 2:39:32.900]  the canadian people without their consent
[2:39:32.900 --> 2:39:36.420]  and it also explains in the document that there are areas in the united states
[2:39:36.420 --> 2:39:39.980]  work that were also under this program yet i don't know whether modifications
[2:39:39.980 --> 2:39:41.500]  since the thirties

[2:39:44.580 --> 2:39:45.460]  on uh...
[2:39:45.460 --> 2:39:47.580]  prison planet dot tb just google it
[2:39:47.580 --> 2:39:50.460]  or search it when you're there on the side of your name for as you say the
[2:39:50.460 --> 2:39:53.860]  information about they just have to look at the now announced it
[2:39:53.860 --> 2:39:56.220]  they are doing testing
[2:39:56.220 --> 2:39:57.820]  and under u.s. code
[2:39:57.820 --> 2:40:00.780]  title fifty chapter thirty two subsection one thousand five hundred twenty eight
[2:40:00.780 --> 2:40:01.780]  paragraph b
[2:40:01.780 --> 2:40:05.980]  it says they can do chemical biological radiological testing if it's part of
[2:40:05.980 --> 2:40:08.020]  research or law enforcement
[2:40:08.020 --> 2:40:11.700]  so they go over just researching spring you
[2:40:11.700 --> 2:40:14.740]  and the guy says i don't believe they're dispersing into the fans in the jet
[2:40:14.740 --> 2:40:16.660]  fuel that's one theory
[2:40:16.660 --> 2:40:19.020]  all we know is these trails inform
[2:40:19.020 --> 2:40:23.340]  like they are before nineteen ninety five or so ninety six on a wide scale
[2:40:23.340 --> 2:40:26.500]  and now the president now so we're thinking about
[2:40:26.500 --> 2:40:30.300]  spring the atmosphere with particular in the very particular we said they were
[2:40:30.300 --> 2:40:31.860]  spring from the test
[2:40:31.860 --> 2:40:36.460]  to to do this to the environment and you know uh... i
[2:40:36.460 --> 2:40:40.100]  i had really vicious threats on my children from multiple angles when i did
[2:40:40.100 --> 2:40:43.420]  the chemtrail shows two weeks ago i mean they are really
[2:40:43.420 --> 2:40:44.540]  mad
[2:40:44.540 --> 2:40:47.540]  and uh... you know they email you they call you and they say i must have your
[2:40:47.540 --> 2:40:50.380]  children i'm gonna come in the final unstable
[2:40:50.380 --> 2:40:52.540]  and you give it to the police and they do nothing
[2:40:52.540 --> 2:40:55.940]  so i mean that's that's who these people are they're very upset
[2:40:55.940 --> 2:40:58.580]  we need more people fighting aside from yourself
[2:40:58.580 --> 2:41:00.740]  listen to this second piece
[2:41:00.740 --> 2:41:06.500]  i met last summer a well-to-do woman from british columbia
[2:41:06.500 --> 2:41:10.780]  just out of nowhere in our conversation told me that a group of people within
[2:41:10.780 --> 2:41:13.100]  her community were so sick and tired
[2:41:13.100 --> 2:41:15.740]  of the billowing
[2:41:15.740 --> 2:41:17.540]  above their uh...
[2:41:17.540 --> 2:41:21.220]  city they actually went to transport canada
[2:41:21.220 --> 2:41:26.020]  who admitted the official with caught off guard admitted
[2:41:26.020 --> 2:41:29.180]  praying with occurring because it was there
[2:41:29.180 --> 2:41:31.700]  to help uh... canadian
[2:41:31.700 --> 2:41:35.860]  uh... alleviate them from the radiation coming off of the fun
[2:41:35.860 --> 2:41:38.180]  there was uh... particulate
[2:41:38.180 --> 2:41:40.300]  being added to the fuel
[2:41:40.300 --> 2:41:41.980]  containing barium
[2:41:41.980 --> 2:41:43.780]  and aluminum
[2:41:43.780 --> 2:41:46.300]  in order to divert the time to race
[2:41:46.300 --> 2:41:50.100]  so these enraged community members drop a petition
[2:41:50.100 --> 2:41:52.580]  and now the petition has been sent to law
[2:41:52.580 --> 2:41:56.180]  that these plans are no longer to fly over their airspace on trying to get a
[2:41:56.180 --> 2:41:57.340]  hold of her
[2:41:57.340 --> 2:42:00.660]  just so that she can provide a video for you for my package
[2:42:00.660 --> 2:42:03.020]  and she can talk about this petition
[2:42:03.020 --> 2:42:06.460]  i mean this is unprecedented they've actually got something about that
[2:42:06.460 --> 2:42:08.500]  there's a lot of folks are getting mad
[2:42:08.500 --> 2:42:12.140]  and other people are just in denial about this and how can you deny that
[2:42:12.140 --> 2:42:15.460]  just like they're in denial about uh... they've denied the global currency the
[2:42:15.460 --> 2:42:20.380]  global bank they denied the carbon taxes were coming they just deny deny deny
[2:42:20.380 --> 2:42:25.140]  deny deny because who wants to admit we're in the middle of the eugenics war
[2:42:25.140 --> 2:42:28.300]  well i have a global elite a waging war on us in the
[2:42:28.300 --> 2:42:32.140]  and in the public has to wake up to the full insanity of this
[2:42:32.140 --> 2:42:35.580]  well i know that fellow that called you last week about the tell
[2:42:35.580 --> 2:42:39.460]  the department of energy working with various universities on this program
[2:42:39.460 --> 2:42:42.460]  well i looked into it in the university of manitoba
[2:42:42.460 --> 2:42:46.940]  is huge they're all involved all the big research universities no i've
[2:42:46.940 --> 2:42:50.260]  i separately research what he was talking about it's all admitted
[2:42:50.260 --> 2:42:51.740]  that's the crazy part you go
[2:42:51.740 --> 2:42:55.020]  hey they're all admitting and they just go shut up crazy person
[2:42:55.020 --> 2:42:57.820]  and uh... it's uh...
[2:42:57.820 --> 2:43:01.780]  you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna put together a billboard in this city
[2:43:01.780 --> 2:43:03.460]  that has a picture
[2:43:03.460 --> 2:43:04.980]  of the spring
[2:43:04.980 --> 2:43:09.060]  occurring over maybe your legislative grounds that happens every day
[2:43:09.060 --> 2:43:13.820]  and i'm going to i it's going to be stopped bring up and it's going to lead
[2:43:13.820 --> 2:43:17.140]  uh... you know i'm trying to think of a website that they could go to what would
[2:43:17.140 --> 2:43:20.420]  what would be the best website that i could have on this billboard
[2:43:20.420 --> 2:43:23.300]  i would probably think california skywatch is pretty darn good i

[2:45:03.060 --> 2:45:05.860]  the conversation with all the 30 seconds and
[2:45:05.860 --> 2:45:09.380]  it's crazy that i see i see i hear and see things like this all the time i

[2:45:17.220 --> 2:45:20.340]  if you would have said you had kids they would have told you do you know how
[2:45:20.340 --> 2:45:23.540]  much they save your children from diseases and how wonderful they are
[2:45:23.540 --> 2:45:27.140]  are you vaccinated they call those kind of push polls or push calls
[2:45:27.140 --> 2:45:31.220]  they also have automated systems that do that uh... but
[2:45:31.220 --> 2:45:34.180]  they're running tv ads about how vaccines are really good for you
[2:45:34.180 --> 2:45:37.780]  how corn syrup is really good for you uh... how you're an idiot if you don't
[2:45:37.780 --> 2:45:40.660]  think it's good for you so we're having an effect on them
[2:45:40.660 --> 2:45:46.580]  that they're having to counter us but yeah again they're testing
[2:45:46.580 --> 2:45:49.540]  keeping it compartmentalized keeping their own people that are administering
[2:45:49.540 --> 2:45:51.540]  it in the dark who want to wear what's happening
[2:45:51.540 --> 2:45:54.820]  they're testing how to cover up the deaths how to just
[2:45:54.820 --> 2:45:58.820]  you know just again turn up the background noise just incrementally
[2:45:58.820 --> 2:46:03.460]  increase what they're doing so like the frog in the pot we don't notice it
[2:46:03.460 --> 2:46:06.500]  and when you're talking about obama the biggest thing to wake up the obama
[2:46:06.500 --> 2:46:10.500]  supporters is i'm not for mccain i'm saying they're both
[2:46:10.500 --> 2:46:13.940]  puppets there's two puppets dad i would get two toy puppets i go to the toy
[2:46:13.940 --> 2:46:16.100]  store i get two puppets and i'd say dad
[2:46:16.100 --> 2:46:19.460]  which puppet do you like which puppet you gonna vote for he's gonna vote for
[2:46:19.460 --> 2:46:21.940]  either puppet their puppets and say but wait a minute shouldn't you be looking
[2:46:21.940 --> 2:46:25.380]  at who's controlling the puppets that's what i'm saying that i'm not for mccain
[2:46:25.380 --> 2:46:28.660]  or obama and that seems to get through to people
[2:46:28.660 --> 2:46:32.180]  but they immediately they're thinking you're for bush you're for all of that
[2:46:32.180 --> 2:46:35.380]  no i'm not for bush i'm trying to explain there on this it's
[2:46:35.380 --> 2:46:39.300]  maybe explain to your dad like he knows don king rigs a lot of fights right
[2:46:39.300 --> 2:46:43.700]  yeah well say dad why why is boxing dead because don king took it over created
[2:46:43.700 --> 2:46:48.660]  a monopoly and uh... everybody knows it's a fraud now
[2:46:48.660 --> 2:46:52.340]  and so he owns both fighters i mean is a boxing match
[2:46:52.340 --> 2:46:55.700]  where both fighters are owned by the same club is that a boxing match you
[2:46:55.700 --> 2:47:02.260]  trust and then i mean it's real simple
[2:47:02.260 --> 2:47:06.420]  yes it is it it it trips me out
[2:47:06.420 --> 2:47:10.100]  of a lot you know with him because you like like you just said
[2:47:10.100 --> 2:47:13.220]  if i didn't vote for a bonus money a lot of people ask people i voted for when
[2:47:13.220 --> 2:47:16.420]  they find out that i didn't vote for obama all you want from mccain or like
[2:47:16.420 --> 2:47:19.540]  well i didn't vote for mccain either so they thought well who did you vote for
[2:47:19.540 --> 2:47:22.420]  and then i named my candidate and they're like who is that i'm like did you do
[2:47:22.420 --> 2:47:25.700]  your research on all that was uh that was running
[2:47:25.700 --> 2:47:29.300]  no like well i'm like see that's your problem you automatically think oh
[2:47:29.300 --> 2:47:32.500]  if i'm not a democrat i must be a republican i'm not i'm a republican i
[2:47:32.500 --> 2:47:36.660]  must i must be a democrat but you know
[2:47:36.660 --> 2:47:41.220]  that's that's how it is in Georgia it's a big obama a big obama time from
[2:47:41.220 --> 2:47:44.100]  ellen also and also i bought your dvd
[2:47:44.100 --> 2:47:47.620]  i made a lot of copies i'm passing out the people that work into my friends
[2:47:47.620 --> 2:47:50.340]  and you know i actually i woke up two people
[2:47:50.340 --> 2:47:54.020]  not too long ago we watched the dvd at their house and they were like oh my
[2:47:54.020 --> 2:47:56.900]  god you like this money because you were telling me all the stuff and now he's
[2:47:56.900 --> 2:48:01.460]  starting to see the things i see and the things that i hear from you i'm
[2:48:01.460 --> 2:48:04.340]  starting to hear you know he's starting to see more of that i'm like see
[2:48:04.340 --> 2:48:08.020]  it's called opening your eyes instead of just listening to fox news or
[2:48:08.020 --> 2:48:11.300]  saying it's called doing your research seeing what else is out there instead of
[2:48:11.300 --> 2:48:14.740]  mainstream media well i also predicted because it wasn't hard to predict it's
[2:48:14.740 --> 2:48:18.100]  how they operate they're gonna have racist attack obama
[2:48:18.100 --> 2:48:21.940]  they'll probably have attempts on him by you know buck toothed clan people
[2:48:21.940 --> 2:48:25.300]  uh... they're gonna hype that up even if it isn't racist it's just a tea party
[2:48:25.300 --> 2:48:29.380]  they're gonna say it is to get everybody going well he isn't perfect
[2:48:29.380 --> 2:48:32.660]  but the racists don't like him so i'm gonna be for him
[2:48:32.660 --> 2:48:35.860]  you know and the same thing with the you know with the bush people well bush
[2:48:35.860 --> 2:48:39.540]  isn't perfect but at least he's not a liberal so people gotta get their minds
[2:48:39.540 --> 2:48:42.740]  around this how they're being suckered good to hear from you sir i really
[2:48:42.740 --> 2:48:44.820]  appreciate your call let's take another one
[2:48:44.820 --> 2:48:48.100]  robert in texas you're on the air go ahead robert
[2:48:48.100 --> 2:48:52.020]  hi alec how are you doing today oh pretty good
[2:48:52.020 --> 2:48:55.620]  okay um i got a couple things real quick i want to get out of the way
[2:48:55.620 --> 2:49:00.100]  first i do want to say um i want to make a little bit of a prediction
[2:49:00.100 --> 2:49:05.220]  uh it's not that much of a prediction but i think if they uh stage a uh false
[2:49:05.220 --> 2:49:09.460]  flag attack they're gonna get a guy and they're gonna say he went to tea party
[2:49:09.460 --> 2:49:13.460]  that's something they're gonna do oh absolutely and anytime somebody shoots a
[2:49:13.460 --> 2:49:16.980]  cop they'll look at the thousand websites they visited and they'll find the one
[2:49:16.980 --> 2:49:19.540]  patriot site and said we made them kill everybody
[2:49:19.540 --> 2:49:22.660]  and uh oh yeah i mean you heard the caller earlier and i've told people
[2:49:22.660 --> 2:49:26.020]  that saw this stuff where you have provocateurs they're trying to start
[2:49:26.020 --> 2:49:31.780]  fights uh you know just amazing oh yeah and um i had
[2:49:31.780 --> 2:49:35.700]  called you before and told you about this website but i got the website wrong
[2:49:35.700 --> 2:49:42.020]  it's uh powercast co powercast co dot com i actually ended up finding it because
[2:49:42.020 --> 2:49:46.020]  i googled it um they changed the the front of the website
[2:49:46.020 --> 2:49:49.460]  uh the web page the way it looks before they had a soldier on there and it
[2:49:49.460 --> 2:49:54.100]  looked really creepy they had stuff about rfid on there on the front
[2:49:54.100 --> 2:49:57.860]  but you can still find the stuff about the rfid if you know well every website
[2:49:57.860 --> 2:50:00.820]  saying they've got something doesn't necessarily mean it's true i don't know
[2:50:00.820 --> 2:50:03.540]  the side so i can't say one way or the other
[2:50:03.540 --> 2:50:07.300]  yeah yeah definitely oh yeah and i wanted to ask you also uh if
[2:50:07.300 --> 2:50:10.980]  have you heard of uh something uh project named
[2:50:10.980 --> 2:50:17.700]  rods from god it's a uh it's a space base weapon
[2:50:17.700 --> 2:50:22.500]  rods from god yeah it's a space base weapon basically
[2:50:22.500 --> 2:50:26.900]  it's a it's that's just the code name for it um you could google it there's a
[2:50:26.900 --> 2:50:29.700]  little information on that i would recommend people look that up
[2:50:29.700 --> 2:50:33.380]  um i bet they already have it up there because if they're willing to let any
[2:50:33.380 --> 2:50:37.540]  information out on it you know that then they you know you know how it works
[2:50:37.540 --> 2:50:41.060]  um well i know what the real weapon systems are
[2:50:41.060 --> 2:50:44.820]  i mean i've talked go ahead and tell us what what's the system
[2:50:44.820 --> 2:50:51.860]  there it releases 20 foot uh steel and uh tungsten coated rods that fall to the
[2:50:51.860 --> 2:50:56.900]  earth and the uh the magnetic energy created by them is equal to a nuclear
[2:50:56.900 --> 2:51:00.980]  weapon but there's no trace no no i'm aware of those and yes that that's a
[2:51:00.980 --> 2:51:04.980]  real this year many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut
[2:51:04.980 --> 2:51:09.300]  back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future

[2:59:51.140 --> 3:00:11.140]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[3:00:11.140 --> 3:00:15.140]  all right folks we are alive i'm jason bermus sitting in for just
[3:00:15.140 --> 3:00:20.180]  a couple of segments for alex jones and we're going to do a bermus news blitz
[3:00:20.180 --> 3:00:24.420]  here in the next 15 or so minutes
[3:00:24.420 --> 3:00:28.180]  i really want to cover australia and uk news
[3:00:28.180 --> 3:00:32.660]  because both of these uh countries are going to be participating in this n le
[3:00:32.660 --> 3:00:36.500]  09 exercise and this is really a nexus point
[3:00:36.500 --> 3:00:41.140]  all right we know that obama wants a civilian national security force as
[3:00:41.140 --> 3:00:44.580]  large as the actual army as well funded as well man
[3:00:44.580 --> 3:00:48.820]  well now paul rudd who is the prime minister over in australia wants the
[3:00:48.820 --> 3:00:52.260]  same thing a civilian corpsman by everyday australians to help out in
[3:00:52.260 --> 3:00:54.740]  war zones and natural disasters is set to be announced
[3:00:54.740 --> 3:00:57.700]  by prime minister kevin rudd in perth on wednesday
[3:00:57.700 --> 3:01:01.780]  now they already have uh these brute force squads
[3:01:01.780 --> 3:01:05.380]  uh... and i'm gonna be playing videos of those tonight on my program
[3:01:05.380 --> 3:01:08.740]  on the info warrior from nine to midnight and i've got to probably vet it for
[3:01:08.740 --> 3:01:12.020]  language because international tv is always a little bit different but
[3:01:12.020 --> 3:01:15.300]  basically they have these cops in black uniforms and uh they just patrol the
[3:01:15.300 --> 3:01:18.260]  streets as the tough guys they're in the tough zones
[3:01:18.260 --> 3:01:21.620]  so they're militarizing the police and they're saying no we need the civilian
[3:01:21.620 --> 3:01:25.220]  corps as well so they're creating another
[3:01:25.220 --> 3:01:29.860]  military-like force outside of the police force which they're already
[3:01:29.860 --> 3:01:33.300]  militarizing remember australia is going to be big
[3:01:33.300 --> 3:01:37.780]  in this n le 09 exercise where a terrorist attack happens somewhere
[3:01:37.780 --> 3:01:40.980]  outside of the united states uh we would assume it will be either in the
[3:01:40.980 --> 3:01:44.900]  uk mexico canada or australia because those are the
[3:01:44.900 --> 3:01:47.140]  countries that are participating
[3:01:47.140 --> 3:01:51.300]  but what all else is really interesting is that both the uk
[3:01:51.300 --> 3:01:55.220]  leaders within the uk and australia are also calling for massive population
[3:01:55.220 --> 3:01:57.620]  reductions
[3:01:57.620 --> 3:02:02.260]  we cover this one right here uh... a few weeks ago on the alex jones show and
[3:02:02.260 --> 3:02:08.340]  on my program u k population must fall to 30 million says port
[3:02:08.340 --> 3:02:12.260]  and uh... jonathan port is one of gordon browns leading green advisors
[3:02:12.260 --> 3:02:15.860]  remember gordon brown member of the world's sustainable ability uh
[3:02:15.860 --> 3:02:17.540]  society and
[3:02:17.540 --> 3:02:21.300]  the word sustainability means you have to die that's what it means you have to
[3:02:21.300 --> 3:02:24.180]  be controlled you have to have a one-child policy you have to be
[3:02:24.180 --> 3:02:27.540]  sterilized that's what sustainability means when these people talk about it
[3:02:27.540 --> 3:02:32.020]  how else are they going to take a population of seventy million people
[3:02:32.020 --> 3:02:34.980]  which is what the uk has and bring it down to thirty million
[3:02:34.980 --> 3:02:35.940]  uh...
[3:02:35.940 --> 3:02:37.780]  by i think twenty twenty
[3:02:37.780 --> 3:02:40.980]  i was like uh... twenty thirty one
[3:02:40.980 --> 3:02:44.020]  i mean unbelievable
[3:02:44.020 --> 3:02:47.380]  other people within this world sustainable society here are calling for
[3:02:47.380 --> 3:02:49.380]  the same thing
[3:02:49.380 --> 3:02:53.700]  in australia australia should consider having a one-child policy
[3:02:53.700 --> 3:02:57.460]  to protect the planet an environment a lobby group says sustainable
[3:02:57.460 --> 3:02:59.620]  population australia
[3:02:59.620 --> 3:03:03.140]  remember it's all about sustainability says slashing the world's population is
[3:03:03.140 --> 3:03:04.900]  the only way
[3:03:04.900 --> 3:03:07.620]  to avoid environmental suicide
[3:03:07.620 --> 3:03:10.740]  see some of you're gonna have to die or we're all gonna die
[3:03:10.740 --> 3:03:13.780]  we're gonna kill the planet that's the propaganda folks
[3:03:13.780 --> 3:03:17.300]  and uh... national president sandra kank once australia's population of almost
[3:03:17.300 --> 3:03:20.420]  twenty two million reduced to seven million
[3:03:20.420 --> 3:03:23.380]  to tackle climate change
[3:03:23.380 --> 3:03:25.820]  that's a sixty seven percent reduction
[3:03:25.820 --> 3:03:28.540]  that's two out of three of you
[3:03:28.540 --> 3:03:31.180]  done do you do you do you get it
[3:03:31.180 --> 3:03:32.900]  sustainability
[3:03:32.900 --> 3:03:34.380]  killing people
[3:03:34.380 --> 3:03:37.540]  that's what it means it means killing people ted turner gets on their knees
[3:03:37.540 --> 3:03:40.460]  like global warren's because there's too many people
[3:03:40.460 --> 3:03:43.660]  and it keeps going like this they're gonna all die and then the ones that are
[3:03:43.660 --> 3:03:45.940]  left over gonna be in a cannibal society
[3:03:45.940 --> 3:03:49.340]  and uh... the bottom line is we need a sustainable population
[3:03:49.340 --> 3:03:53.940]  too many people charlie roe's too many
[3:03:53.940 --> 3:03:58.420]  it's propaganda on another level folks where they're trying to make you guilty
[3:03:58.420 --> 3:04:01.060]  eating breathing being a human being
[3:04:01.060 --> 3:04:03.220]  driving an s u v
[3:04:03.220 --> 3:04:06.580]  in europe they're pumping the propaganda that americans use too much toilet
[3:04:06.580 --> 3:04:10.580]  paper are to ply is worse than s u v is that gas guzzling
[3:04:10.580 --> 3:04:14.380]  amid evil carbon dioxide even though we ran this story last night on the info

[3:04:26.660 --> 3:04:29.460]  boss of global warming if this is true
[3:04:29.460 --> 3:04:30.860]  it will go nowhere
[3:04:30.860 --> 3:04:32.380]  because they still be
[3:04:32.380 --> 3:04:35.740]  folks they're saying that too many trees are causing global warming now it's
[3:04:35.740 --> 3:04:37.420]  all about a taxation
[3:04:37.420 --> 3:04:41.700]  a carbon emissions control grid where they can go after
[3:04:41.700 --> 3:04:44.180]  corporations that that are part of the ballgame
[3:04:44.180 --> 3:04:46.380]  people that are going along with the program and then they can tax the

[3:08:52.340 --> 3:08:53.940]  tribal even
[3:08:53.940 --> 3:08:57.640]  drill where they are literally going to go after
[3:08:57.640 --> 3:09:03.020]  every piece of infrastructure they can fema region six washington dc texas is
[3:09:03.020 --> 3:09:05.860]  going to be involved new mexico
[3:09:05.860 --> 3:09:09.580]  and a few other states now remember they're also going to use international
[3:09:09.580 --> 3:09:11.220]  organizations
[3:09:11.220 --> 3:09:13.940]  and that the terrorist attack is going to happen overseas now there may be
[3:09:13.940 --> 3:09:16.340]  terrorist attacks that happen during this drill
[3:09:16.340 --> 3:09:21.460]  in this country they say that it's open there is no determined result
[3:09:21.460 --> 3:09:24.580]  i really doubt that they're going to use this as an opportunity to pull off a
[3:09:24.580 --> 3:09:25.620]  false flag
[3:09:25.620 --> 3:09:30.180]  however it is to train people so that when they do put another drill into
[3:09:30.180 --> 3:09:30.900]  place
[3:09:30.900 --> 3:09:33.940]  or another drill comes up two or three months down the line
[3:09:33.940 --> 3:09:35.340]  that then
[3:09:35.340 --> 3:09:37.140]  one that's less publicized then
[3:09:37.140 --> 3:09:39.380]  they will pull off their false flag attack
[3:09:39.380 --> 3:09:42.620]  just like on nine eleven see they have amalgam vergo
[3:09:42.620 --> 3:09:44.860]  run in uh... june
[3:09:44.860 --> 3:09:46.940]  of two thousand and one where they
[3:09:46.940 --> 3:09:50.620]  hijacked a plane and they ran into the capitol building and bin laden is on the
[3:09:50.620 --> 3:09:52.500]  cover of the document
[3:09:52.500 --> 3:09:54.060]  and then the second part
[3:09:54.060 --> 3:09:58.420]  is fb i agents are going to live hijacked a plane
[3:09:58.420 --> 3:10:01.780]  and then fly it to secure location amalgam vergo check it out and then
[3:10:01.780 --> 3:10:04.500]  nine eleven happens on this on the morning nine eleven similar drills are
[3:10:04.500 --> 3:10:08.180]  happening summer majorly classified the last one that came out literally came
[3:10:08.180 --> 3:10:11.820]  out six months ago it's called operation jackal cave
[3:10:11.820 --> 3:10:15.300]  and two paragraphs are uncensored in nine page document
[3:10:15.300 --> 3:10:16.300]  do you wonder
[3:10:16.300 --> 3:10:19.180]  if that could have anything to do with middle eastern terrorists attacking
[3:10:19.180 --> 3:10:20.780]  america on nine eleven
[3:10:20.780 --> 3:10:23.900]  i wonder i mean you know the national reconnaissance office is only running a
[3:10:23.900 --> 3:10:27.580]  drill eight forty six in the morning with the cia of ramming a plane into the
[3:10:27.580 --> 3:10:29.060]  bill into a building
[3:10:29.060 --> 3:10:32.180]  you know there's only mass hijacking drills going on nine eleven that's why
[3:10:32.180 --> 3:10:34.220]  we have to keep an eye on this
[3:10:34.220 --> 3:10:38.020]  and remember these private sector organizations are ones like a t and t
[3:10:38.020 --> 3:10:41.300]  that have been caught helping the government wiretap and spy on the
[3:10:41.300 --> 3:10:44.740]  american people at every turn every corner
[3:10:44.740 --> 3:10:49.060]  i mean we can have the guy go on msnbc go on over minutes a yeah i went in the
[3:10:49.060 --> 3:10:52.220]  secret room i was looking up the ethernet wire to this computer that
[3:10:52.220 --> 3:10:56.100]  was making a hard copy of every communication a t and t has
[3:10:56.100 --> 3:10:59.020]  and then they just say you know what national security you can't sue
[3:10:59.020 --> 3:11:01.620]  civil suit we're gonna dismiss it
[3:11:01.620 --> 3:11:04.060]  and then the obama administration comes in
[3:11:04.060 --> 3:11:04.980]  and they say
[3:11:04.980 --> 3:11:08.740]  you know what maybe these chain bush powers they need to be expanded they
[3:11:08.740 --> 3:11:11.100]  don't need to be retracted i know we promised
[3:11:11.100 --> 3:11:13.980]  that we were going to get rid of all this tyranny but let's just up the stakes
[3:11:13.980 --> 3:11:14.860]  folks
[3:11:14.860 --> 3:11:18.300]  i mean patriot acts one two parts of three that wasn't enough military
[3:11:18.300 --> 3:11:19.220]  commissions act
[3:11:19.220 --> 3:11:21.260]  ending habeas corpus in this country
[3:11:21.260 --> 3:11:22.660]  not enough
[3:11:22.660 --> 3:11:26.420]  let's start ending positive commentatus on a mass level let's announce
[3:11:26.420 --> 3:11:28.180]  that the national guard is just gonna
[3:11:28.180 --> 3:11:31.860]  you know help find the drugs and patrol the streets and help with car accidents
[3:11:31.860 --> 3:11:35.820]  then we'll build a national service corporation with the give act
[3:11:35.820 --> 3:11:39.180]  and then we'll brainwash everybody just around september eleventh we do a
[3:11:39.180 --> 3:11:40.660]  little knock and talk to me
[3:11:40.660 --> 3:11:42.940]  come on join the civil service corps
[3:11:42.940 --> 3:11:46.460]  look we're helping people we have memorials all around the country
[3:11:46.460 --> 3:11:49.020]  it's national service day huh
[3:11:49.020 --> 3:11:52.380]  let's feel together like we did after nine eleven let's come together as one
[3:11:52.380 --> 3:11:53.780]  we can do it
[3:11:53.780 --> 3:11:55.500]  it's just disgusting
[3:11:55.500 --> 3:11:58.700]  and meanwhile people like myself and alex jones are
[3:11:58.700 --> 3:12:01.100]  constantly ridiculed
[3:12:01.100 --> 3:12:03.520]  and savagely attack in the mainstream media
[3:12:03.520 --> 3:12:06.420]  and now there's this angels and demons movie
[3:12:06.420 --> 3:12:08.460]  coming out
[3:12:08.460 --> 3:12:12.340]  so as choir is running this uh... are you know disgusting article where of
[3:12:12.340 --> 3:12:16.180]  course nine eleven truth is associated with holless call holocaust denial and
[3:12:16.180 --> 3:12:20.300]  we hate the jews again and you know birth of a nation all this johnny
[3:12:20.300 --> 3:12:24.380]  nonsense when as choir enables these people and promotes their propaganda on
[3:12:24.380 --> 3:12:26.420]  another level i have you guys seen
[3:12:26.420 --> 3:12:30.300]  the obama cover of s choir is looking all tough he looks almost like a statue
[3:12:30.300 --> 3:12:32.300]  it's looking up and he's the leader
[3:12:32.300 --> 3:12:33.540]  he's the new leader
[3:12:33.540 --> 3:12:36.020]  and they put this out there
[3:12:36.020 --> 3:12:39.540]  let's see uh... starts off uh... the difference between the minions obsessing
[3:12:39.540 --> 3:12:42.980]  with angels and demons the new illuminati picture by dan brown who did a
[3:12:42.980 --> 3:12:43.940]  fancy code
[3:12:43.940 --> 3:12:48.420]  and the whack jobs denying nine eleven and the holocaust see they go hand in
[3:12:48.420 --> 3:12:50.220]  hand arm and arm
[3:12:50.220 --> 3:12:53.820]  that's what they want you to associate us with nazis
[3:12:53.820 --> 3:12:54.980]  it's a mean
[3:12:54.980 --> 3:13:00.180]  this program has been going on since the inception of nine eleven truth
[3:13:00.180 --> 3:13:04.860]  and the whack jobs denying nine eleven and the holocaust say a lot about obama's
[3:13:04.860 --> 3:13:10.060]  hopes for a new era of responsibility you see it's all it's all pro obama
[3:13:10.060 --> 3:13:13.340]  anti nine eleven truth
[3:13:13.340 --> 3:13:16.540]  nine eleven deniers this is how it starts nine eleven deniers and of course
[3:13:16.540 --> 3:13:18.660]  nine eleven deniers is linked
[3:13:18.660 --> 3:13:20.060]  to uh...
[3:13:20.060 --> 3:13:22.660]  i sent you guys the link we bring that up on prison planet dot tv by the way
[3:13:22.660 --> 3:13:23.220]  guys
[3:13:23.220 --> 3:13:26.660]  nine eleven deniers has the link to the popular mechanics article we know how
[3:13:26.660 --> 3:13:29.740]  credible popular mechanics has been with their thorough debunking of the fema
[3:13:29.740 --> 3:13:33.740]  camps showing a satellite photo in a video from nineteen ninety six and say
[3:13:33.740 --> 3:13:35.420]  no not real
[3:13:35.420 --> 3:13:38.380]  yet there's six hundred locations that we know about all over the country we're
[3:13:38.380 --> 3:13:40.140]  gonna go to the train station
[3:13:40.140 --> 3:13:42.580]  we're gonna show you and track trains
[3:13:42.580 --> 3:13:47.540]  popular mechanics i mean just stellar work i love it i mean
[3:13:47.540 --> 3:13:50.660]  so they link to that and then of course they have to put in the moon landing
[3:13:50.660 --> 3:13:54.860]  paranoia is in the next one is the casandras of the new world order you know
[3:13:54.860 --> 3:13:58.420]  the new world order doesn't exist just a headline a time magazine two week two
[3:13:58.420 --> 3:14:00.780]  weeks ago barack obama's new world order

[3:14:03.980 --> 3:14:07.340]  last six months november obama's new world order
[3:14:07.340 --> 3:14:10.860]  time magazine the new world order talking about the new for global financial

[3:14:14.020 --> 3:14:18.140]  and then of course uh... barack obama's new world order right after the g twenty
[3:14:18.140 --> 3:14:19.340]  but doesn't exist

[3:16:52.340 --> 3:16:54.140]  aroused over that
[3:16:54.140 --> 3:16:57.740]  and somebody who i really like because he exposes how it's not a left-right
[3:16:57.740 --> 3:17:00.300]  paradigm he exposes the patriot actor bush
[3:17:00.300 --> 3:17:02.980]  he talks about how obama lied is expanding it
[3:17:02.980 --> 3:17:06.700]  uh... he talks about really what this country is facing
[3:17:06.700 --> 3:17:08.780]  and so we are really uh... honored
[3:17:08.780 --> 3:17:10.260]  uh... to have uh...

[3:17:48.540 --> 3:17:51.820]  it is alex uh... i just had that uh...
[3:17:51.820 --> 3:17:56.540]  pastor steven anderson on my uh... freedom watchbox news dot com internet
[3:17:56.540 --> 3:17:57.860]  show and we
[3:17:57.860 --> 3:18:01.900]  we saw the tape of the uh... but not even border patrol their border agents that
[3:18:01.900 --> 3:18:07.020]  were seventy five miles from the mexico arizona border deep into arizona
[3:18:07.020 --> 3:18:10.220]  uh... taser him stomp on his face
[3:18:10.220 --> 3:18:14.060]  precedent to uh... cracked glass and uh... asphalt
[3:18:14.060 --> 3:18:17.020]  because he would not give them permission to search his truck and i
[3:18:17.020 --> 3:18:19.060]  made fun of him then they made fun of him
[3:18:19.060 --> 3:18:23.300]  yes they mocked him and said you must be uh... a terrorist and they told him that
[3:18:23.300 --> 3:18:27.400]  the constitution didn't apply to them and where he happened to be
[3:18:27.400 --> 3:18:31.540]  the local news in that today coming from the supreme court and unusual
[3:18:31.540 --> 3:18:34.060]  combination of liberals and conservatives
[3:18:34.060 --> 3:18:36.700]  issued an opinion like uh... last night
[3:18:36.700 --> 3:18:39.340]  saying the police can't search your truck anymore
[3:18:39.340 --> 3:18:41.980]  either have to get your permission or they have to get a search warrant the
[3:18:41.980 --> 3:18:42.980]  old rule
[3:18:42.980 --> 3:18:45.740]  that they could search anything we want to make in the car
[3:18:45.740 --> 3:18:49.540]  really because they stopped you for uh... going to miles over the limit or
[3:18:49.540 --> 3:18:51.100]  not having a seat belt on
[3:18:51.100 --> 3:18:52.380]  is now history
[3:18:52.380 --> 3:18:54.860]  so that they should put a little bit of a crimp
[3:18:54.860 --> 3:18:59.020]  in the in the armor of the jackbooth talks not enough but a little bit and
[3:18:59.020 --> 3:19:01.980]  journey of a thousand miles begins with a single pace but there's a lot of
[3:19:01.980 --> 3:19:04.140]  puddles still to come
[3:19:04.140 --> 3:19:06.020]  absolutely uh...

[3:19:09.540 --> 3:19:11.100]  i want to get into
[3:19:11.100 --> 3:19:14.620]  obama because i i was driving to work the other morning listening to you on xm

[3:24:08.820 --> 3:24:14.460]  judge Andrew Napolitano yeah when I watch his Fox internet show he also
[3:24:14.460 --> 3:24:18.900]  contributes on Fox TV it's like watching my own show the judges perspective
[3:24:18.900 --> 3:24:21.900]  actually covers the police state the new world order the radio shows great as
[3:24:21.900 --> 3:24:27.000]  well got about 45 after judge let's get right into Morocco Obama I mean the
[3:24:27.000 --> 3:24:30.100]  media is not even making a big deal out of this but yeah I mean knowing the law
[3:24:30.100 --> 3:24:34.140]  studying the Nuremberg situation the just following orders what is happening
[3:24:34.140 --> 3:24:40.260]  here well you know the president is in a little bit of a bind I really don't
[3:24:40.260 --> 3:24:45.900]  agree with him on on any of his publicly stated positions except in part this
[3:24:45.900 --> 3:24:52.500]  one which is to review and reveal so that we can review the advice that was
[3:24:52.500 --> 3:24:57.340]  given to the Bush administration basically telling it it could that CIA
[3:24:57.340 --> 3:25:01.420]  agents could do whatever they wanted I profoundly disagreed with him when he
[3:25:01.420 --> 3:25:06.340]  originally said both personally and through his chief of staff Roman manual
[3:25:06.340 --> 3:25:10.620]  that nobody will be prosecuted and he seems to have backed off on that but you
[3:25:10.620 --> 3:25:14.100]  know there are prosecutions and there are prosecutions when the American
[3:25:14.100 --> 3:25:19.980]  military treated Iraqi prisoners like dogs literally but putting dog collars
[3:25:19.980 --> 3:25:25.140]  on them and keeping them naked and flush piles and inducing unnatural and
[3:25:25.140 --> 3:25:30.420]  immoral sexual acts they prosecuted a private and a sergeant they never
[3:25:30.420 --> 3:25:34.820]  prosecuted anybody up the up the chain of command however far it went and
[3:25:34.820 --> 3:25:38.780]  there's evidence that Secretary Rumsfeld himself was aware of that and he
[3:25:38.780 --> 3:25:42.780]  looked the other way condoned it or authorized it the same must be the case
[3:25:42.780 --> 3:25:48.060]  for these torture memos now give you a little bit of information one is that the
[3:25:48.060 --> 3:25:53.300]  torture memos are exceptionally one-sided that is when a client says to a
[3:25:53.300 --> 3:25:58.580]  lawyer may I do this it's the lawyer's job to amass the law in favor of the
[3:25:58.580 --> 3:26:05.820]  this and against the this and then give a conclusion this these memos don't do
[3:26:05.820 --> 3:26:12.540]  that they compliment the CIA for having the patience to wait and ask we now know
[3:26:12.540 --> 3:26:16.500]  they didn't wait they started this stuff before they even got the memo and it
[3:26:16.500 --> 3:26:21.660]  then gives all sorts of twisted tortured interpretations of words in order to
[3:26:21.660 --> 3:26:27.060]  justify what the CIA wanted to do two points one the author the principal
[3:26:27.060 --> 3:26:30.460]  author of these memos now a federal judge he never would have been confirmed
[3:26:30.460 --> 3:26:34.140]  of the memos been released before his confirmation that's another story
[3:26:34.140 --> 3:26:42.580]  opines in these memos that he cannot say for sure if the medieval torture
[3:26:42.580 --> 3:26:49.580]  devices of the thumb screw and the rack constitute torture so they obviously
[3:26:49.580 --> 3:26:57.740]  picked someone to write these memos with an extremely perverse threshold as to
[3:26:57.740 --> 3:27:05.220]  what is torture and what isn't to Bob Bear a former CIA agent with whom I have
[3:27:05.220 --> 3:27:10.180]  clashed many times over the Constitution came on to my radio show Brian on the
[3:27:10.180 --> 3:27:14.900]  judge this morning and startled my partner who favors all this torture and
[3:27:14.900 --> 3:27:19.740]  I who of course oppose it with every fiber in my being by saying the following
[3:27:19.740 --> 3:27:26.780]  the CIA exaggerated the extent of the danger that was posed by these people
[3:27:26.780 --> 3:27:32.980]  uninterrogated it exaggerated the nature of what it expected they knew and it
[3:27:32.980 --> 3:27:37.580]  exaggerated what it received from them question from my partner Brian Kilmeade
[3:27:37.580 --> 3:27:41.700]  what about the second wave and what about the third wave of attacks that never
[3:27:41.700 --> 3:27:46.340]  came because of the information obtained by these enhanced interrogation
[3:27:46.340 --> 3:27:51.780]  techniques answer the CIA exaggerated that as well there never has been any
[3:27:51.780 --> 3:27:57.340]  evidence of the planning of a second or a third wave so when you put all this
[3:27:57.340 --> 3:28:02.780]  together you really have a a horrific series of events a lawyer telling his
[3:28:02.780 --> 3:28:08.300]  boss he can do whatever he wants the CIA carefully manipulating the Justice
[3:28:08.300 --> 3:28:12.340]  Department and the White House into giving it the authority that wants to
[3:28:12.340 --> 3:28:18.980]  do a compliant president whom Carl Rose told me on my show read the memos they
[3:28:18.980 --> 3:28:22.100]  said how do you know he read them he said well we read them together meaning
[3:28:22.100 --> 3:28:26.100]  they were probably read out loud to each other you can speculate on the
[3:28:26.100 --> 3:28:32.220]  reasons for that we have a very very sad state of affairs if no one is
[3:28:32.220 --> 3:28:36.940]  prosecuted then we really have a rejuvenation of the
[3:28:36.940 --> 3:28:40.740]  Nuremberg defense which is I thought it was legal and I was told to do it by my
[3:28:40.740 --> 3:28:46.180]  bosses that defense has been rejected by every signatory to the Geneva
[3:28:46.180 --> 3:28:50.180]  conventions which is virtually every every country on the planet except for
[3:28:50.180 --> 3:28:58.060]  China Israel and and Iran Israel didn't exist at the time and I don't believe
[3:28:58.060 --> 3:29:03.740]  it subsequently an act of them I might be wrong that every country in the world
[3:29:03.740 --> 3:29:11.900]  agrees that the Nuremberg defense is no longer valid it's amazing to to have
[3:29:11.900 --> 3:29:16.740]  this going on and they also did things like grab people and get them to give
[3:29:16.740 --> 3:29:22.900]  confessions to bombing buildings that didn't exist when they were arrested so
[3:29:22.900 --> 3:29:29.860]  we also know it was used for fake and confessions judge and you know Obama
[3:29:29.860 --> 3:29:34.420]  claims he's backing office now we need to see prosecution or where does it go
[3:29:34.420 --> 3:29:37.700]  from there I mean once you start torturing people where does it end and
[3:29:37.700 --> 3:29:42.220]  now when our troops get captured how do we say it's not okay for other countries
[3:29:42.220 --> 3:29:47.340]  to torture them it's like this Iranian American being grabbed by the Iranians
[3:29:47.340 --> 3:29:50.540]  are saying she had a kangaroo court well how do we say it's a kangaroo court
[3:29:50.540 --> 3:29:54.420]  when the military commissions does that we're on the march the empires on the
[3:29:54.420 --> 3:30:04.180]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network more than 700 chemicals have been
[3:30:04.180 --> 3:30:07.740]  found in our drinking water and did you know that you have greater exposure to
[3:30:07.740 --> 3:30:10.700]  these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water
[3:30:10.700 --> 3:30:14.460]  that's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others
[3:30:14.460 --> 3:30:18.900]  are absorbed into the skin the KDF dual media shower filter works with both
[3:30:18.900 --> 3:30:23.340]  hot and cold water and it's designed to reduce chlorine lead mercury and iron

[3:33:53.180 --> 3:33:56.380]  people are concerned about bankrupting the country or the police state or the
[3:33:56.380 --> 3:34:01.300]  12.8 trillion spent so far 98% of Americans in polls against the
[3:34:01.300 --> 3:34:05.660]  bailouts I mean that is cold-blooded for the system to come out and say no you're
[3:34:05.660 --> 3:34:09.460]  all racist and some Americans end up believing that they can oh my god there's
[3:34:09.460 --> 3:34:14.540]  all these racist out there isn't that what's racist to claim it's all racist
[3:34:14.540 --> 3:34:18.620]  injecting race card into something that isn't even about that the people that
[3:34:18.620 --> 3:34:22.660]  are that are challenging these gatherings and quite frankly I had hoped it
[3:34:22.660 --> 3:34:25.780]  would bring out more people than it did but it did send a little bit of a
[3:34:25.780 --> 3:34:30.020]  message the message was that these are homogeneous groups I mean these were
[3:34:30.020 --> 3:34:35.340]  people from all across the socioeconomic and political spectrum saying enough is
[3:34:35.340 --> 3:34:38.300]  enough with the federal government where the numbers overwhelming no they
[3:34:38.300 --> 3:34:42.380]  weren't where they peaceful absolutely was I had all of them no I monitored many
[3:34:42.380 --> 3:34:47.500]  of them through our facilities here at Fox I heard nothing even remotely racist
[3:34:47.500 --> 3:34:54.220]  look if if the if the pro Obama forces think that they can tarnish with the
[3:34:54.220 --> 3:35:00.220]  word racism anybody who disagrees with them they're in for a very very serious
[3:35:00.220 --> 3:35:05.860]  battle and their Orwellian redefinition of words simply won't work I disagree
[3:35:05.860 --> 3:35:11.220]  with this president on almost everything he does I am an anti-racist my new book
[3:35:11.220 --> 3:35:15.980]  dred Scott's revenge a legal history of race and freedom in America was written
[3:35:15.980 --> 3:35:21.020]  to remind white people what blacks went through in this country that doesn't mean
[3:35:21.020 --> 3:35:24.940]  I agree with everything the president has done in fact I disagree with almost all
[3:35:24.940 --> 3:35:29.740]  of it I would define anybody who disagrees with him on ideological or
[3:35:29.740 --> 3:35:35.820]  political grounds to say that that disagreement is racially based well I
[3:35:35.820 --> 3:35:39.460]  mean it's just a complete distraction isn't it judged from reality people
[3:35:39.460 --> 3:35:43.580]  they're saying we don't want more taxes we don't more regulation and they run
[3:35:43.580 --> 3:35:47.060]  the president the American people electing and then they say if you
[3:35:47.060 --> 3:35:52.300]  criticize anything he's doing youth brigades tattletale squads government
[3:35:52.300 --> 3:35:55.980]  money being spent on USA service to create a private army for the Democrats
[3:35:55.980 --> 3:36:01.580]  they just say every single one of you as a racist I mean that is just outrageous
[3:36:01.580 --> 3:36:07.100]  probably outrageous because it reveals the moral depravity of their argument
[3:36:07.100 --> 3:36:12.180]  they're unwilling to engage people who challenge the federal government in a
[3:36:12.180 --> 3:36:15.420]  meaningful debate about the appropriate role of the federal government in our
[3:36:15.420 --> 3:36:19.660]  constitutional society and in order to avoid that challenge they touch the
[3:36:19.660 --> 3:36:24.820]  third rail of American politics which is racism but this will not last the
[3:36:24.820 --> 3:36:29.380]  American people will realize that the folks who are in favor of big government
[3:36:29.380 --> 3:36:34.180]  cannot avoid the debate by claiming that everyone that wants to challenge big
[3:36:34.180 --> 3:36:38.020]  government is a racist because the head of the government happens to be biracial
[3:36:38.020 --> 3:36:41.700]  I happen to think it's a great thing that the head of the government is a
[3:36:41.700 --> 3:36:46.380]  biracial to try and put race behind us even though I disagree with this
[3:36:46.380 --> 3:36:51.180]  president on virtually everything he stands for but they want to continue to
[3:36:51.180 --> 3:36:56.500]  now inject race into it it's race-baiting it's actually creating racial
[3:36:56.500 --> 3:37:00.820]  division isn't that funny because the Department of Homeland Security report
[3:37:00.820 --> 3:37:05.220]  which came out last week condemned race-baiting even though the
[3:37:05.220 --> 3:37:10.740]  administration that produced it is now using it in order to avoid confronting
[3:37:10.740 --> 3:37:17.620]  the issues do you think that was a political H bomb or or I mean how big
[3:37:17.620 --> 3:37:21.460]  how big a deal is this that we always explain to people this police state
[3:37:21.460 --> 3:37:25.980]  apparatus for al-qaeda was really being set up for the American people and now
[3:37:25.980 --> 3:37:30.500]  all these federal and state my ac reports and an intelligence reports are
[3:37:30.500 --> 3:37:35.100]  out saying gun owners people buying ammo veterans of the number one threat I
[3:37:35.100 --> 3:37:43.740]  think that this is really a wake-up call I I think that the DHS report was a
[3:37:43.740 --> 3:37:48.540]  was a bucket of cold water in the face of many conservative Republicans who
[3:37:48.540 --> 3:37:55.020]  are pro-life who are pro-gun who do welcome returning veterans who are
[3:37:55.020 --> 3:38:00.060]  concerned about the orders and who are concerned about the size and scope of
[3:38:00.060 --> 3:38:03.620]  the federal government why do I tick off those five attributes because the
[3:38:03.620 --> 3:38:09.340]  report says people who it embrace any of those five causes on the on that side
[3:38:09.340 --> 3:38:13.500]  on the gun side on the life side on the anti-federal government side are as
[3:38:13.500 --> 3:38:18.660]  dangerous as race-based skinheads and I say to my conservative Republican
[3:38:18.660 --> 3:38:23.380]  friends or they say to me well how can the government monitor me how does the
[3:38:23.380 --> 3:38:30.340]  government know that I'm pro-life that I'm pro-gun that I question the size and
[3:38:30.340 --> 3:38:33.060]  scope of the federal government I say well remember the government can listen
[3:38:33.060 --> 3:38:37.300]  to your phone calls and can monitor the keystrokes on your computer without a
[3:38:37.300 --> 3:38:42.220]  warrant these days DHS agents just like FBI agents can write their own search
[3:38:42.220 --> 3:38:45.220]  warrants they don't have to go to a judge they don't have to present probable
[3:38:45.220 --> 3:38:48.940]  cause of crime anymore and then my conservative Republican friends said
[3:38:48.940 --> 3:38:54.460]  well where did that come from and then I say the Patriot Act which George Bush
[3:38:54.460 --> 3:38:58.900]  and the conservative Republicans in the Congress gave to us the people that
[3:38:58.900 --> 3:39:03.700]  wrote this abominable law trusted Bush and his agents with this power it's now
[3:39:03.700 --> 3:39:08.820]  in the hands of President Obama and his agents and suddenly they regret and
[3:39:08.820 --> 3:39:12.420]  resent having given that kind of power to the federal government and that's my
[3:39:12.420 --> 3:39:16.420]  final question I want to talk about all the books you've written here briefly
[3:39:16.420 --> 3:39:19.620]  a judge to Paul Itano you say you're talking to a lot of high-powered
[3:39:19.620 --> 3:39:22.860]  Republicans I know you talked to him on TV every day they're starting to figure
[3:39:22.860 --> 3:39:27.380]  out now what they let to the government the powers that they let the
[3:39:27.380 --> 3:39:33.980]  government get they handed to President Obama an imperial
[3:39:33.980 --> 3:39:39.740]  presidency with powers far greater than what Bill Clinton handed to George W. Bush
[3:39:39.740 --> 3:39:45.740]  the Republicans created that imperial presidency it is as disrespectful it
[3:39:45.740 --> 3:39:51.540]  is as faithless to the Constitution as anything FDR did and it may be as
[3:39:51.540 --> 3:39:56.900]  faithless to the Constitution as Abraham Lincoln in terms of its violation of
[3:39:56.900 --> 3:40:01.020]  natural rights and its violation of specifically enunciated rights in the
[3:40:01.020 --> 3:40:04.980]  Constitution itself what do you think about the left a lot of them defending
[3:40:04.980 --> 3:40:10.300]  Obama now on hiring nothing but lobbyist expanding wars saying they're
[3:40:10.300 --> 3:40:14.020]  going to expand warrantless spying saying he's going to keep all these new
[3:40:14.020 --> 3:40:18.900]  powers I mean he that is I mean I know we're used to politicians lying but he
[3:40:18.900 --> 3:40:23.500]  said this is going to be different this time well he's not I mean he has kept
[3:40:23.500 --> 3:40:28.500]  to this this awful hideous thing in in play called state secrets which is
[3:40:28.500 --> 3:40:32.420]  basically a doctrine that if the government makes enough of a hue and
[3:40:32.420 --> 3:40:38.260]  cry that it can't reveal what's in its its bag of tricks that a lawsuit goes
[3:40:38.260 --> 3:40:42.580]  away left state secrets be revealed of course when the government loses that
[3:40:42.580 --> 3:40:46.140]  argument it turns out that no state secrets in fact were revealed Barack
[3:40:46.140 --> 3:40:50.980]  Obama condemned this concept when he was senator Obama and candidate Obama he's
[3:40:50.980 --> 3:40:55.420]  now instructed his Justice Department to continue the same thing look it's a
[3:40:55.420 --> 3:40:59.660]  liberal version of big government versus a conservative version of big
[3:40:59.660 --> 3:41:04.220]  government it is disrespect for the individual it is the exaltation of the
[3:41:04.220 --> 3:41:09.620]  state over the individual it's the same thing over and over and over again
[3:41:09.620 --> 3:41:13.900]  it's instead of corporate welfare there's individual welfare instead of
[3:41:13.900 --> 3:41:17.180]  allowing the rich to get richer it will try and pull down the rich in order to
[3:41:17.180 --> 3:41:23.820]  uplift the poor none of this planned central economic planning none of this
[3:41:23.820 --> 3:41:28.660]  assault on civil liberties has ever produced happiness or prosperity the
[3:41:28.660 --> 3:41:33.540]  question is when and how will we stop it yeah they're trying to hang this
[3:41:33.540 --> 3:41:37.460]  banking disaster around the necks of free market people and this isn't free
[3:41:37.460 --> 3:41:42.460]  market this is government teaming up with select corporations and producing
[3:41:42.460 --> 3:41:47.900]  fraudulent debt instruments fraudulent Ponzi schemes and then government is now
[3:41:47.900 --> 3:41:52.460]  taking 12.8 trillion of tax money and giving it to the crooks instead of
[3:41:52.460 --> 3:41:58.060]  arresting them well you're listed the banks that were giving mortgages out
[3:41:58.060 --> 3:42:03.860]  for no money down George W. Bush ordered his housing and urban development
[3:42:03.860 --> 3:42:09.460]  department HUD to give out mortgages with no money down to 150,000 people the
[3:42:09.460 --> 3:42:13.420]  vast majority of those things have already defaulted and who got those
[3:42:13.420 --> 3:42:18.220]  mortgages Fannie and Freddie and where do they get their money from the taxpayer
[3:42:18.220 --> 3:42:25.620]  I mean the bankers were doing what the government instructed them to do get
[3:42:25.620 --> 3:42:31.260]  mortgages to people who are not credit worthy use low teaser rates keep the
[3:42:31.260 --> 3:42:35.540]  rates artificially low don't worry what will happen when the rates go up there
[3:42:35.540 --> 3:42:40.260]  this was not the free market run amok this was the banking system doing what
[3:42:40.260 --> 3:42:46.380]  the government forced it to do and like all central planning it came down with
[3:42:46.380 --> 3:42:50.380]  a crash absolutely in closing tell us about your newest book and some of the
[3:42:50.380 --> 3:42:54.780]  others judge Andrew I was sitting on the radio with Brian Kilmeade my partner
[3:42:54.780 --> 3:43:00.020]  listening to a lot of well-intended African-American
[3:43:00.020 --> 3:43:05.620]  cores not outraged by Jeremiah right I'm thinking to myself what the heck is
[3:43:05.620 --> 3:43:08.740]  going on here why are they not outraged that he's saying things like the
[3:43:08.740 --> 3:43:12.460]  government caused AIDS and I went back and did a lot of research well the
[3:43:12.460 --> 3:43:16.540]  government didn't cause AIDS the government did give syphilis to hundreds
[3:43:16.540 --> 3:43:20.780]  and hundreds of innocent black men that the federal government said it was
[3:43:20.780 --> 3:43:24.860]  curing in fact it was slowly killing them it went on from the FDR
[3:43:24.860 --> 3:43:28.940]  administration to Richard Nixon learned about it and he stopped the government
[3:43:28.940 --> 3:43:34.660]  did suspend the free will of African-Americans based on collectivism
[3:43:34.660 --> 3:43:38.460]  based on race based upon the notion that the government can enact whatever laws
[3:43:38.460 --> 3:43:45.380]  it wants and and I wanted to remind white people what blacks went through
[3:43:45.380 --> 3:43:50.620]  because if the government can do this to a group of people based on race it could
[3:43:50.620 --> 3:43:55.660]  do it to a group of people based on their ideas and what happened to African
[3:43:55.660 --> 3:44:03.780]  Americans in 1860 and in 1960 could happen to you and me in 2010
[3:44:03.780 --> 3:44:06.820]  writer I want to read I've read some of your other books I haven't read the
[3:44:06.820 --> 3:44:10.580]  dread Scots revenge but we've got it up on screen right now fire up some of the
[3:44:10.580 --> 3:44:16.140]  websites so folks can find out more thank you so much what are some of the best
[3:44:16.140 --> 3:44:20.140]  websites to visit though there's quite a few you're associated with well the
[3:44:20.140 --> 3:44:25.260]  rockwell.com is very very generous to me and a lot of my things are
[3:44:25.260 --> 3:44:32.020]  published there I'm also posted on foxnews.com probably once or twice a
[3:44:32.020 --> 3:44:37.580]  week if you go to foxnews.com freedom watch or if you just plug in freedom
[3:44:37.580 --> 3:44:42.700]  watch on YouTube you'll find hundreds and hundreds of websites that capture my
[3:44:42.700 --> 3:44:46.660]  show freedom watch and that just spread it all over the place look my show two
[3:44:46.660 --> 3:44:51.740]  weeks ago at 500,000 hits that I won't name the name of networks but that's
[3:44:51.740 --> 3:44:57.580]  more than at least two cable networks have in one case all day in another
[3:44:57.580 --> 3:45:03.900]  case all week just my one hour watching and arguing about and explaining the
[3:45:03.900 --> 3:45:08.300]  loss of freedom in America well that shows how hungry people are is that fox
[3:45:08.300 --> 3:45:14.340]  is now intelligently putting the real you know truth you on the air but
[3:45:14.340 --> 3:45:20.020]  Internet only and it's bigger than the other little rinky-dink networks with
[3:45:20.020 --> 3:45:25.700]  the CIA officer over there and the heir to the Astor family saying that the
[3:45:25.700 --> 3:45:30.300]  heart weird sexual stuff that the tea parties are doing and saying we're all
[3:45:30.300 --> 3:45:33.700]  racist and and the other network and it's the same thing here I put out the
[3:45:33.700 --> 3:45:39.300]  Obama deception over 15 million views in five weeks and oh it's insane
[3:45:39.300 --> 3:45:43.660]  working my numbers Alex I gotta I gotta learn some of your secret no no no hey
[3:45:43.660 --> 3:45:46.580]  hey no no no you just started your new TV show you know you're contributing on
[3:45:46.580 --> 3:45:51.180]  the main channel but I mean no it's what I'm saying is that 500,000 on one
[3:45:51.180 --> 3:45:54.700]  little video you did you're doing them all the time I'm saying that's huge most
[3:45:54.700 --> 3:45:58.740]  our videos probably get 20 30 40,000 views but I mean to sit there and to see
[3:45:58.740 --> 3:46:03.100]  that you're doing that that shows me people are hungry for the truth it shows
[3:46:03.100 --> 3:46:08.220]  me the status are in trouble absolutely hi Julie and I wrote this book to
[3:46:08.220 --> 3:46:14.960]  remind people what runaway statism can produce absolutely and the thugs are
[3:46:14.960 --> 3:46:18.180]  trying to keep us under control the left-wing and right-wing thugs and
[3:46:18.180 --> 3:46:23.020]  judge if good people just lift a finger together I don't see the system being
[3:46:23.020 --> 3:46:25.820]  able to get away with this but they aren't they're not gonna go away without
[3:46:25.820 --> 3:46:29.740]  a fight no they're not and that's why we have to stay on the air and keep
[3:46:29.740 --> 3:46:34.660]  monitoring what's what's happening I love every minute of it Alex and we'll
[3:46:34.660 --> 3:46:38.260]  talk to you soon all right thank you so much see it freedom watch take care
[3:46:38.260 --> 3:46:41.500]  thank you bye bye all right there he goes yeah they're gonna be back on next
[3:46:41.500 --> 3:46:46.260]  week or something okay good having him on yeah absolutely this is what blows me
[3:46:46.260 --> 3:46:53.660]  away if you look at the ratings of MSNBC and CNBC they'll have like a hundred
[3:46:53.660 --> 3:47:01.180]  thousand viewers at 10 o'clock at night and their top shows I'll have like 500
[3:47:01.180 --> 3:47:08.660]  thousand no one is watching this crap now Fox is smart and acts like they're
[3:47:08.660 --> 3:47:13.940]  anti-new world order so they're three four million five million people watching
[3:47:13.940 --> 3:47:19.940]  still when you get into real ratings coast-to-coast AM has 16 million
[3:47:19.940 --> 3:47:28.340]  listeners a night rush limbaugh has 22 million a day that's the real radio
[3:47:28.340 --> 3:47:32.980]  shows folks then you look at me down here in the minor leagues comparatively I
[3:47:32.980 --> 3:47:39.740]  dwarf MSNBC and CNBC but they can get advertisers to spend $50,000 for a
[3:47:39.740 --> 3:47:43.700]  minute ad and they're getting no response it's all made up it's all fake
[3:47:43.700 --> 3:47:49.580]  it's all imaginary we'll be lucky if we get $100 a spot that's how
[3:47:49.580 --> 3:47:56.900]  fast backwards it is because it's the delusion illness of the teleprompters of
[3:47:56.900 --> 3:48:00.340]  the fanciness of all of that that's why I thought about maybe I should come in
[3:48:00.340 --> 3:48:03.940]  or in and wear a suit and make it look like a regular TV studio all our
[3:48:03.940 --> 3:48:06.260]  problems will be over we could actually defeat the new world or raising the
[3:48:06.260 --> 3:48:12.380]  capital I mean we're on over 70 AM and FM stations now we've got a lot of new
[3:48:12.380 --> 3:48:15.700]  affiliates very thankful to all those stations and those stations you know get
[3:48:15.700 --> 3:48:18.340]  the ratings in and it's hundreds of thousands of listeners smaller
[3:48:18.340 --> 3:48:23.100]  stations tens of thousands when I'm on conservatively Ted has a lot of
[3:48:23.100 --> 3:48:26.220]  stations don't subscribe to the arbitration ratings so they don't have
[3:48:26.220 --> 3:48:31.860]  them smaller stations but Ted has gone and got the ratings before 315,000
[3:48:31.860 --> 3:48:38.700]  listeners every 15 minutes 315,000 on AM and FM and it's actually a lot more than
[3:48:38.700 --> 3:48:41.420]  that it's about half our stations don't subscribe to the arbitration so they
[3:48:41.420 --> 3:48:44.460]  can't use those numbers you got to pay to be able to subscribe and find out what
[3:48:44.460 --> 3:48:49.660]  your ratings are was it cost money to do you know to do the ratings so let's say
[3:48:49.660 --> 3:48:54.140]  conservatively 500,000 listeners every 15 minutes people always ask how many
[3:48:54.140 --> 3:48:57.660]  listeners do I have I kind of a mainstream media here go oh not that many but
[3:48:57.660 --> 3:49:01.260]  you know the whole point is might as well just admit it to people millions and
[3:49:01.260 --> 3:49:05.180]  millions listening on AM and FM every day in the four hours number one on
[3:49:05.180 --> 3:49:09.980]  shoutcast number one radio talk show and shoutcast about to be number one over
[3:49:09.980 --> 3:49:16.340]  music even about to be total number one and we haven't even figured out how to
[3:49:16.340 --> 3:49:20.260]  get all the people listening to our streams to get those connected in where
[3:49:20.260 --> 3:49:24.900]  it shows up on shoutcast that you're not even seeing all of our listeners on
[3:49:24.900 --> 3:49:29.260]  there with the window stream and some flash stream and a bunch of other stuff
[3:49:29.260 --> 3:49:33.500]  there's thousands you can't see and then there's the YouTube and the Google and
[3:49:33.500 --> 3:49:40.260]  all the videos people posted the audio it is just ultra massive go ahead start
[3:49:40.260 --> 3:49:43.380]  playing this newscast clip we're gonna come back with it and finish up on the
[3:49:43.380 --> 3:49:47.580]  other side Simon Johnson declares influence of Wall Street oligarchs
[3:49:47.580 --> 3:49:51.980]  u.s a banana republic on mainstream television here it is contrary to the
[3:49:51.980 --> 3:49:55.500]  assertions of many politicians in wall street the crisis that we're going
[3:49:55.500 --> 3:49:59.740]  through is not new at all fact our guest today Simon Johnson is a former
[3:49:59.740 --> 3:50:04.660]  economist for the IMF and currently a professor at MIT says that when he was at
[3:50:04.660 --> 3:50:08.540]  the IMF he saw this crisis over and over again it was just happening in
[3:50:08.540 --> 3:50:12.980]  emerging markets instead of it a country like the United States so professor what
[3:50:12.980 --> 3:50:18.300]  are the similarities well Henry I'm drawing on my experience roughly 20
[3:50:18.300 --> 3:50:21.980]  years of working on crises not just at the IMF but when I was working in the
[3:50:21.980 --> 3:50:26.380]  private sector and the university with the IMF and sometimes on the same side
[3:50:26.380 --> 3:50:29.620]  sometimes sometimes not so much and their key thing is of course you have a
[3:50:29.620 --> 3:50:33.580]  boom you have a group that drives an economy up they're often called the
[3:50:33.580 --> 3:50:37.660]  oligarchs in various countries and they do well for themselves and for the
[3:50:37.660 --> 3:50:42.140]  country for a while but then comes a bust some sort of crisis of confidence
[3:50:42.140 --> 3:50:46.420]  and the oligarchs are a big problem at that point that much about the United
[3:50:46.420 --> 3:50:50.220]  States as we built up a financial sector we built up to come back and we're
[3:50:50.220 --> 3:50:54.380]  gonna play the end of this and a few other little tidbits here so be sure

[3:54:11.420 --> 3:54:18.060]  into a burning ring of fire I went down down down by the way we've been watching
[3:54:18.060 --> 3:54:23.500]  this video and it burns burns burns a bell pass of Texas with a reporter trying
[3:54:23.500 --> 3:54:28.060]  to get video of a ring of truck topped over and the cop runs over and resting
[3:54:28.060 --> 3:54:33.260]  and there's looks looks like Marines running around in the video if you watch
[3:54:33.260 --> 3:54:37.580]  it carefully ordering the police around and we know they're out there so that's
[3:54:37.580 --> 3:54:40.460]  just all part of the insanity I want to finish up this clip where they're
[3:54:40.460 --> 3:54:44.500]  talking about the oligarchs running things the banking oligarchs that rule
[3:54:44.500 --> 3:54:49.780]  us that are now even directing our governments that's right they're not
[3:54:49.780 --> 3:54:56.300]  elected they go on national TV and say that we're above the government the
[3:54:56.300 --> 3:55:00.180]  current Fed chiefs done that so was Alan Greenspan I'm getting sick of it but

[3:56:00.740 --> 3:56:04.020]  go ahead and finish up with this clip here it is
[3:56:07.820 --> 3:56:12.100]  oh that side shut down just at the IMF but when I was working in the private
[3:56:12.100 --> 3:56:16.220]  sector and the university with the IMF and sometimes on the same side
[3:56:16.220 --> 3:56:19.500]  sometimes sometimes not so much and their key thing is of course you have a
[3:56:19.500 --> 3:56:23.460]  boom you have a group that drives an economy up they're often called the
[3:56:23.460 --> 3:56:27.500]  oligarchs in various countries and they do well for themselves and for the
[3:56:27.500 --> 3:56:32.020]  country for a while but then comes a bust some sort of crisis of confidence
[3:56:32.020 --> 3:56:36.020]  and the oligarchs are a big problem at that point and that's my point about the
[3:56:36.020 --> 3:56:39.300]  United States as we built up a financial sector we built up some very strong
[3:56:39.300 --> 3:56:43.220]  players in that financial sector and it was fine for as long as the boom lasted
[3:56:43.220 --> 3:56:46.860]  but it built vulnerabilities into the system and those vulnerabilities are
[3:56:46.860 --> 3:56:51.420]  very hard to overcome because the these powerful people these oligarchs in the
[3:56:51.420 --> 3:56:56.860]  United States remain so strong and so central to everything and you sound as
[3:56:56.860 --> 3:57:00.460]  though you wrote in a very well-received article in the Atlantic where you lay
[3:57:00.460 --> 3:57:03.820]  all this out recently but it sounds as though you feel like policy is still
[3:57:03.820 --> 3:57:08.860]  being dictated by Washington effectively kowtowing to the oligarchs who are the
[3:57:08.860 --> 3:57:13.220]  names we all know and love from Wall Street I think big finance that the
[3:57:13.220 --> 3:57:16.820]  major banks on Wall Street are far too influential I'm not saying they're
[3:57:16.820 --> 3:57:20.220]  dictating it but they're having a huge amount of impact and you can see them
[3:57:20.220 --> 3:57:23.620]  negotiating with the government actually through the newspapers a lot now
[3:57:23.620 --> 3:57:26.860]  where they're the head of JP Morgan or the head of government will make
[3:57:26.860 --> 3:57:30.260]  statements that are clearly designed to push the government in certain
[3:57:30.260 --> 3:57:33.700]  directions and of course it's not just their ties to the administration they're
[3:57:33.700 --> 3:57:37.780]  also incredibly well connected on Capitol Hill and that's an important
[3:57:37.780 --> 3:57:42.100]  part of how they get things done also and so how do these situations resolve
[3:57:42.100 --> 3:57:46.220]  themselves if you go back to the IMF and a typical emerging market what happens
[3:57:46.220 --> 3:57:49.780]  how do you break that cycle well there has to be a shift in power and in most
[3:57:49.780 --> 3:57:53.380]  countries that the IMF is traditionally dealt with there's a crisis a severe
[3:57:53.380 --> 3:57:57.340]  crisis and pretty much an economic and financial collapse and in that situation
[3:57:57.340 --> 3:58:02.060]  some of the powerful players lose out now the IMF when it comes in if it does if
[3:58:02.060 --> 3:58:06.020]  it sees the situation clearly and in my view does this job properly it'll help
[3:58:06.020 --> 3:58:13.740]  tilt the balance so you can remember the IMF is European okay and dominated they
[3:58:13.740 --> 3:58:17.940]  want control of the United States and so this is a fight with the bankers he's
[3:58:17.940 --> 3:58:21.780]  on there kind of telling on himself a little bit to get more power and control
[3:58:21.780 --> 3:58:26.140]  but they are very interesting video clip the rest of it's up at info wars calm
