[00:54.920 --> 00:58.640]  hours as we are every weekday and then Lord willing I'll be back this Sunday
[00:58.640 --> 01:02.520]  4 to 6 p.m. with a Sunday transmission we have info wars nightly news weeknight
[01:02.520 --> 01:10.340]  7 o'clock central at info wars news calm Lou Rockwell to break down the
[01:10.340 --> 01:15.440]  current globalist socialist collectivist operations we'll be joining us
[01:15.440 --> 01:22.560]  coming up in the second hour today to cover the waterfront we were able to get
[01:22.560 --> 01:30.360]  on short notice the victim of Pennsylvania's checkpoints where they
[01:30.360 --> 01:35.560]  take DNA without warrants this is being done under federal grants through
[01:35.560 --> 01:39.040]  intimidation and color of law basically racketeering it's happening all over the
[01:39.040 --> 01:44.720]  country but they intimidate people into doing it by the White House Office of
[01:44.720 --> 01:51.440]  National Drug Control Policy and it's a whole nother federal issue not just a
[01:51.440 --> 01:54.800]  Fourth Amendment issue it's just on every front it's a tenth amendment issue as
[01:54.800 --> 01:59.160]  well the victim that spoke out against this he's going to be coming on the
[01:59.160 --> 02:03.640]  broadcast it's happening in all 50 states and again it is a part of the
[02:03.640 --> 02:07.720]  takeover of society it's standardization the militarization of police that's
[02:07.720 --> 02:12.160]  federal the training to take on the Tea Party that's federal training and it's
[02:12.160 --> 02:16.200]  just total tyranny we have an occupied federal government and this is just what
[02:16.200 --> 02:20.320]  they're doing and we have to admit that's not rhetoric when I say the federal
[02:20.320 --> 02:23.800]  government's occupied by outside corporate interests who go into other
[02:23.800 --> 02:29.640]  third-world countries on record and put in authoritarian regimes buy off the
[02:29.640 --> 02:33.360]  different parliaments and congresses and then convert the countries over to
[02:33.360 --> 02:37.840]  tyrannies in many cases abolishing the parliaments and in congresses later
[02:37.840 --> 02:40.680]  because they don't have to buy off hundreds of people anymore they can just
[02:40.680 --> 02:48.000]  buy off whoever the military junta is whoever the military system in control
[02:48.000 --> 02:55.000]  this so most societies go this direction and we've just got to get the
[02:55.000 --> 03:00.480]  public to admit that I don't know 90% of the time historically you have a total
[03:00.480 --> 03:06.840]  tyranny the other 10% roughly is just different forms of quasi-corruption
[03:06.840 --> 03:12.280]  maybe 1% of the time historically you have a free open vibrant country the
[03:12.280 --> 03:16.520]  problem is is that freedom even any modicum of it America's never been
[03:16.520 --> 03:23.800]  completely free creates so much wealth and liberty that the children of the
[03:23.800 --> 03:30.040]  folks that promoted freedom and prosperity become decadent it's a
[03:30.040 --> 03:35.440]  cycle and then their children become corrupt and lazy and then their children
[03:35.440 --> 03:40.600]  become demonic child sacrificing devil worshipers running around burning
[03:40.600 --> 03:45.960]  cities of the ground that's just how it works again Roman emperors marrying
[03:45.960 --> 03:50.360]  their horses burning down cities for fun Aztecs doing the same thing Druids
[03:50.360 --> 03:54.200]  doing the same thing ancient Chinese dynasty some of them went crazy and did
[03:54.200 --> 03:58.280]  that not quite as often though they did some barbarous stuff Africa same thing
[03:58.280 --> 04:05.120]  24-7 same thing 24-7 indifferent native tribes of the Americas and if you didn't
[04:05.120 --> 04:10.720]  do that a psycho tribe would show up and take you over take New Guinea and the
[04:10.720 --> 04:15.240]  cannibalism and headhunting I mean it's just humans are humans such as we may
[04:15.240 --> 04:19.040]  have different skin colors and stuff you know just like dogs might have someone
[04:19.040 --> 04:23.280]  may have white fur and you know one might have brown fur one might have black
[04:23.280 --> 04:27.240]  fur one might have spots all over it man it's the same brain in there kicking
[04:27.240 --> 04:34.600]  folks same red blood and that dog dogs act the same people same deal folks and
[04:34.600 --> 04:39.840]  if good folks don't get together and come together against tyranny we get
[04:39.840 --> 04:45.320]  enslaved tortured and killed by whatever group comes along to do that and
[04:45.320 --> 04:49.200]  same thing over and over again and it's happening with a high-tech version now
[04:49.200 --> 04:53.960]  we got big news coming up on this Wednesday Worldwide Edition I am your

[05:24.320 --> 05:29.400]  periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15-point
[05:29.400 --> 05:33.440]  IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine

[08:15.480 --> 08:20.040]  you actually look at the details then I think we've struck the right balance and
[08:20.040 --> 08:24.120]  if people can't trust not only the executive branch but also don't trust
[08:24.120 --> 08:30.800]  Congress and don't trust federal judges to make sure that we're abiding by the
[08:30.800 --> 08:36.280]  Constitution due process and rule of law then we're gonna have some problems the
[08:36.280 --> 08:44.400]  Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind we are live in fact live
[08:44.400 --> 08:52.280]  ladies and gentlemen on this Wednesday the 18th day already of December 2013
[08:52.280 --> 09:00.080]  only about 12 days or so left in 2013 we will plunge into 2014 that is such an
[09:00.080 --> 09:05.880]  incredibly important year for the globalist worldwide not just here are
[09:05.880 --> 09:12.480]  trying to submit a corporate private anti-free market mafia monopoly takeover
[09:12.480 --> 09:17.520]  that's what we're in the midst of when the history books are written later if
[09:17.520 --> 09:21.560]  we defeat this system or even partially hold it back we'll look back on this is
[09:21.560 --> 09:27.040]  an incredible time you know Larry claim and the constitutional lawyer is
[09:27.040 --> 09:34.160]  universally reviled and defiled and demonized by mainline Republicans and
[09:34.160 --> 09:41.800]  Democrats because he effectively damaged Bill Clinton he effectively exposed
[09:41.800 --> 09:50.800]  tyranny with the Saudi Arabians in 9-11 he effectively sued the NSA and now has
[09:50.800 --> 09:55.360]  it going to court and it looks like the judge will rule in that case that it's a
[09:55.360 --> 09:59.400]  violation of the Fourth Amendment and so he went on seeing in and they played a
[09:59.400 --> 10:04.920]  demonization piece basically saying he's a blowhard and a egomaniac and doesn't
[10:04.920 --> 10:09.920]  care about America we have the peace I'm gonna play it later and claimant came
[10:09.920 --> 10:14.600]  on and said I just want to point out that's propaganda to prejudice me to
[10:14.600 --> 10:19.120]  the audience and this is a win for America I've got his transcript here
[10:19.120 --> 10:23.960]  I'm paraphrasing it they said this is a win for all Americans and to restore our
[10:23.960 --> 10:29.920]  Republic we're in deep trouble the police state isn't coming it's here he's normal
[10:29.920 --> 10:35.560]  he sees it total above Stasi level spying literally hundreds of times worse
[10:35.560 --> 10:40.400]  than what the East Germans did citizen spies children spies schools openly
[10:40.400 --> 10:44.600]  training everything recorded everything tracked press persecuted with it
[10:44.600 --> 10:50.240]  political minorities and majorities persecuted with it massive felony
[10:50.240 --> 10:54.160]  actions going on billions of times a day every time they grab a piece of data
[10:54.160 --> 10:59.720]  without a warrant and they're publicly using it in federal and state courts
[10:59.720 --> 11:05.000]  admitting everything surveilled the DEA is looking at everything totally
[11:05.000 --> 11:08.560]  illegally and then even creating fake investigation so they can lie to the
[11:08.560 --> 11:13.600]  court and say they didn't get it with illegal wiretaps or illegal data
[11:13.600 --> 11:18.400]  mining that was in the New York Times a month ago I told you years ago that they
[11:18.400 --> 11:25.440]  lie in court with fake investigations manufactured investigations for juries
[11:25.440 --> 11:32.400]  because they don't want to tell them they got the data illegally that is
[11:32.400 --> 11:40.440]  organized fraud at an industrial scale and a McDonald's level scale at a
[11:40.440 --> 11:45.960]  Walmart level scale of that big federal courts are in every major city and
[11:45.960 --> 11:52.800]  they're in federal and state courts by the millions of cases a year and
[11:52.800 --> 11:58.520]  hundreds of thousands of those in total fraud Reuters reported this as well
[11:58.520 --> 12:04.680]  going in with fake cases perjuring themselves to the jury and the judge
[12:04.680 --> 12:09.520]  knows gee you think we might be in a little bit of trouble because folks once
[12:09.520 --> 12:15.080]  they standardized fraud and openly put it into the court and codify it you have
[12:15.080 --> 12:24.480]  a 100% evil government Williamson County north of Austin their former
[12:24.480 --> 12:27.480]  prosecutor and judge is being indicted or been indicted and others are in
[12:27.480 --> 12:31.480]  trouble I've always told you it's the worst county in Texas and probably in
[12:31.480 --> 12:36.160]  the country statistically if you're innocent they want to put you in jail if
[12:36.160 --> 12:42.080]  they have DNA and know who killed your wife they will send you to jail and
[12:42.080 --> 12:46.400]  laugh at you when you're an innocent man with no criminal record a successful
[12:46.400 --> 12:50.480]  businessman and will laugh that you're innocent and let the serial killer go
[12:50.480 --> 13:00.400]  free that's a famous Michael Morton's in case Michael Morton case and again I
[13:00.400 --> 13:06.480]  have lived here in Travis County with more door to the north of me with all
[13:06.480 --> 13:10.920]  these naive retirees up there great people in Williamson County good people
[13:10.920 --> 13:14.880]  horrible government they're always catching George County officials dealing
[13:14.880 --> 13:18.360]  drugs and their kids dealing drugs and the police stealing stuff I mean it
[13:18.360 --> 13:22.720]  because you've got all these mainline conservatives who are living in La La
[13:22.720 --> 13:27.840]  land and are in denial just like you have Democrats living in La La land and
[13:27.840 --> 13:31.960]  Larry claiming comes on and says that piece demonize me and prejudice me this
[13:31.960 --> 13:36.960]  is a win for all of America not about Larry claiming and the disgusting little
[13:36.960 --> 13:42.560]  pretty man you know host sits there and makes fun of him and giggles and says
[13:42.560 --> 13:50.400]  shut his mic off because they've got to demonize the hero they've got to say the
[13:50.400 --> 13:54.760]  good guys bad they've got to say the guy being harassed and threatened oh they
[13:54.760 --> 13:58.960]  make jokes about that you're paranoid with your tinfoil hat they say that's
[13:58.960 --> 14:03.680]  word for word claiming you've been intimidated by the government G he tried
[14:03.680 --> 14:08.720]  to expose Vince Foster murder he tried to expose Clinton for all the lies G he
[14:08.720 --> 14:13.360]  almost brought down Bill Clinton do you really think he hadn't been harassed I've
[14:13.360 --> 14:17.640]  gone in bullhorn to federal judge in the Waco civil trial was threatened to shut
[14:17.640 --> 14:21.520]  up over the phone repeatedly and when I didn't they said we'll be outside later
[14:21.520 --> 14:25.560]  and I didn't believe it and they beat the hell out of me outside saying shut up
[14:25.560 --> 14:33.320]  and don't go back to that trial again I cannot um and of course they got tore up
[14:33.320 --> 14:37.520]  bad as well but I got beat up pretty bad broke my nose you name it of course they
[14:37.520 --> 14:40.520]  kind of freaked out when they broke my nose I just went completely crazy started
[14:40.520 --> 14:47.720]  slamming their heads in the concrete but the point is is that is that this is a
[14:47.720 --> 14:51.760]  real world folks and until you've dealt with the real world you don't know how
[14:51.760 --> 14:56.080]  real it is you don't know what we go through Bongino Obama's former head
[14:56.080 --> 15:00.360]  secret service agent on foreign operations foreign trips has had his house
[15:00.360 --> 15:04.120]  business broken into threats they're trying to plant stuff on him and he's
[15:04.120 --> 15:08.040]  not even giving any Obama's secrets out
[15:11.760 --> 15:16.520]  the point is in a court of law the trials going forward with showing
[15:16.520 --> 15:21.040]  evidence of illegal NSA spying and harassment she it's admitted the NSA
[15:21.040 --> 15:26.160]  spied on hundreds of associated press reporters and that's just the tip of the
[15:26.160 --> 15:35.680]  iceberg of course they're spying on Larry claiming when our crew went up to
[15:35.680 --> 15:42.600]  cover the NSA in Utah that night I'm sitting there and I hear my phone
[15:42.600 --> 15:45.760]  typing and it wasn't a stuck key on the iPhone I went over and someone was
[15:45.760 --> 15:48.280]  sending emails to people I don't even have an email account on there at that
[15:48.280 --> 15:54.920]  time my phone was hijacked I had to turn it off and then destroy it that's the
[15:54.920 --> 16:00.120]  country that we live in ladies and gentlemen that's what's going on on
[16:00.120 --> 16:07.520]  record you can pull up Reuters and the New York Times that guys type it in DEA
[16:07.520 --> 16:13.120]  given NSA data another headline DEA created fake investigations to cover
[16:13.120 --> 16:18.920]  NSA data Reuters AP New York Times you name it did not become a big story though
[16:18.920 --> 16:23.360]  came out a few months ago and was never heard of again there it is the NSA is
[16:23.360 --> 16:27.200]  giving your phone records of the DEA and the DEA is covering it up
[16:27.200 --> 16:32.360]  Washington Post but the big story is hidden in the article they admit they
[16:32.360 --> 16:40.520]  create fake investigations for the jury and the judge organized total fraud and
[16:40.520 --> 16:46.520]  criminal activity in the fake drug war where the majority of drugs are shipped
[16:46.520 --> 16:50.240]  in by big banks that own the aircraft they ship the weapons in that's come out
[16:50.240 --> 16:56.360]  in Bloomberg AP Reuters three hundred and seventy eight billion dollars from
[16:56.360 --> 17:00.760]  2007 to 2009 that's when that investigation came out no one got in
[17:00.760 --> 17:06.200]  trouble three hundred and seventy eight billion dollars billion dollars in
[17:06.200 --> 17:13.040]  Ku Bank Salon Wacovia and Wells Fargo no one got in trouble they paid a one
[17:13.040 --> 17:18.240]  hundred and eleven million dollar fine that if you do the math it'd be like if
[17:18.240 --> 17:21.160]  I robbed a bank and had a million dollars in a van and I gave the cops three
[17:21.160 --> 17:26.320]  thousand dollars here here's your tip now I can go down the road it's organized
[17:26.320 --> 17:32.400]  open criminal activity they said they weren't spying they got caught lying now
[17:32.400 --> 17:38.280]  they say trust us it's for your own good as mainstream news reported yesterday
[17:38.280 --> 17:43.880]  Reuters New York Times again you name it oh we're the US is making ties with
[17:43.880 --> 17:47.160]  radical Islam to bring down a sod because they know we've already exposed
[17:47.160 --> 17:51.160]  them now they're gonna admit it but spin it like it's okay and good our
[17:51.160 --> 17:56.640]  government is illegitimate and hijacked and run by criminal predatory groups
[17:56.640 --> 18:05.320]  that see good men and women as their number one enemy because we can't be
[18:05.320 --> 18:11.080]  bought off we can't be intimidated they can't make us run and they know they've
[18:11.080 --> 18:14.840]  committed all these crimes and they hate us because they're the criminals and
[18:14.840 --> 18:19.560]  they want to fully take over so they don't have to look over their shoulder
[18:19.560 --> 18:23.920]  that's the thing about tyranny folks it grows out of criminals that get control
[18:23.920 --> 18:30.080]  of government and it stinks everything good because it is threatened by the
[18:30.080 --> 18:36.520]  existence of justice it is threatened by the existence of honor it is threatened
[18:36.520 --> 18:42.880]  by the existence of good guys who they know will finally stand up against them
[18:42.880 --> 18:50.440]  and bring them down so if you're a good person but a coward and have stood down
[18:50.440 --> 18:56.000]  because you're afraid of all this you are going to be hunted down like a sheep
[18:56.000 --> 19:02.320]  by wolves because you've laid down Obama came out today I have the article and
[19:02.320 --> 19:10.960]  said the Republicans are like the Jim Jones Guiana cult of Kool-Aid slurping
[19:10.960 --> 19:18.520]  cyanide victims no the entire political system in this country is a giant Jim
[19:18.520 --> 19:23.200]  Jones cult and if you buy into it you do it at the detriment of yourself and
[19:23.200 --> 19:27.520]  your family because this tyranny is going to be the nastiest one the world's
[19:27.520 --> 19:31.000]  ever seen and folks if they don't get in trouble for all the crimes they've been
[19:31.000 --> 19:37.920]  caught committing it sets the precedent and the sky is the limit

[25:17.120 --> 25:21.320]  authoritarian punk wants to ban all your guns wants to legalize all the
[25:21.320 --> 25:27.800]  Legals wants to transfer all wealth from anybody that's middle-class to the poor
[25:27.800 --> 25:33.120]  to then vote to bring in socialism but exempt the ultra-rich what a horrible
[25:33.120 --> 25:39.240]  nightmare that's being reported by the LA Times what a disaster type situation
[25:39.240 --> 25:48.440]  can you just imagine something like that also it's being reported disabled
[25:48.440 --> 25:54.440]  military retirees not exempt from pension cuts in budget deal and they are
[25:54.440 --> 25:59.360]  going to increase the national debt debase the currency give trillions of
[25:59.360 --> 26:02.800]  foreign banks but when they're done the vets will basically get nothing and
[26:02.800 --> 26:06.640]  other federal pensioners will get nothing when they're done you will get a
[26:06.640 --> 26:10.840]  shadow of what you got previously they follow this plan in country after
[26:10.840 --> 26:14.480]  country so we know their blueprint and they are they admit their blueprint
[26:14.480 --> 26:19.200]  homeland securities in place to make sure you never get the government back so
[26:19.200 --> 26:26.280]  all your money can be robbed to make you poor so there is that report provisions
[26:26.280 --> 26:31.160]  cutting pensions of military retirees in the bipartisan budget deal the Senate
[26:31.160 --> 26:35.880]  will vote on this week does not exempt disabled veterans the Washington Free
[26:35.880 --> 26:41.680]  Beacon has learned and it goes on Senate dams block amendment to restore
[26:41.680 --> 26:47.120]  veteran benefits by closing illegal immigrant welfare loophole that's out
[26:47.120 --> 26:51.600]  of the daily caller that's all up on drugsupport.com and info wars.com I
[26:51.600 --> 26:56.280]  mentioned that Larry claiming in huge CNN smackdown he smacks them down even
[26:56.280 --> 27:00.720]  the normally snot-nosed politico did a pretty good job reporting that we're
[27:00.720 --> 27:04.560]  gonna play some of that clip coming up on a work on getting Larry claiming to pop
[27:04.560 --> 27:07.920]  back in today to give us his take on that he was on with us in a 20 minute
[27:07.920 --> 27:14.160]  in-depth interview yesterday where he wasn't being interrupted and and attacked.
[27:14.160 --> 27:19.360]  Look at this political correctness new Mexico teacher who said Santa is white
[27:19.360 --> 27:25.280]  on paid leave I mean I guess if you said George Washington is white or that
[27:25.280 --> 27:30.240]  Martin Luther King was black you'd be put on leave no no no no it's all
[27:30.240 --> 27:35.360]  selective it's like another five-year-old has been suspended for making the image
[27:35.360 --> 27:38.800]  of a gun and on the playground and saying bang bang something we all did
[27:38.800 --> 27:43.000]  it's mind control if they can ban the image of something they can then ban
[27:43.000 --> 27:46.600]  the physical as the head of the Violence Policy Center said years ago they
[27:46.600 --> 27:49.520]  said we don't care of Mr. Jones said in the local paper we don't care he goes
[27:49.520 --> 27:53.680]  out in Rowley's we've got your kids in the education system we're gonna ban your
[27:53.680 --> 28:01.840]  gods and they're very public about that MSNBC says we got your kids suckers so
[28:01.840 --> 28:05.640]  there it is suburban Albuquerque teacher who told the black student Santa Claus
[28:05.640 --> 28:10.920]  is white has been placed on paid administrative leave Rio Rancho school
[28:10.920 --> 28:15.000]  district spokeswoman Kim Vessely confirmed on Tuesday the teacher is out
[28:15.000 --> 28:18.000]  in the classroom while the incident is being investigated I say send them to a
[28:18.000 --> 28:20.520]  reeducation camp they've got to oh here it is
[28:20.520 --> 28:25.560]  Barbara Walters on Obama we thought he was going to be the next Messiah and
[28:25.560 --> 28:29.000]  there's a video clip of that that we're going to be playing when we come back
[28:29.000 --> 28:35.680]  after the break but the issue here is that you've got White House advisors and
[28:35.680 --> 28:41.120]  spokespeople in USA today saying that you know as proxies because Obama stays
[28:41.120 --> 28:44.920]  above all that partisanship he says his attack dogs go out and divide and conquer
[28:44.920 --> 28:49.040]  and race bait and race hustle and everything else and class hustle and
[28:49.040 --> 28:53.920]  you know all the rest of it with their psychological warfare if you're a
[28:53.920 --> 29:00.040]  Republican you're in a Jim Jones death cult well I think you could say if you're
[29:00.040 --> 29:06.080]  a mainline supporter of people like Carl Rove and those that are attacking the
[29:06.080 --> 29:09.320]  real tea party I guess you are in kind of a Jim Jones cult destroying your own
[29:09.320 --> 29:12.920]  interests and selling America out but that's kind of like being at the back
[29:12.920 --> 29:18.200]  of the crowd of your Carl Rove at the death cult up at the front up on the
[29:18.200 --> 29:23.280]  pulpit the Jim Jones is somebody like Barack Hussein Obama selling the Kool-Aid
[29:23.280 --> 29:29.680]  ladling out the fraud betraying his mindless followers I mean look they
[29:29.680 --> 29:33.880]  all said he was Jesus Christ I had that in the Obama deception and I mean we've
[29:33.880 --> 29:41.000]  got Jamie Foxx saying our Lord and Savior Barack Obama Barack Obama you
[29:41.000 --> 29:46.720]  just say that word get a tingle up your leg it's like a sex cult with the folks
[29:46.720 --> 29:52.480]  over in MSNBC hardball we're on the literally the pun the empire is not
[29:52.480 --> 29:57.120]  intentional Chris Matthews Jones and the hardball over Obama I mean I'm sorry it's
[29:57.120 --> 29:59.200]  true

[33:40.240 --> 33:44.360]  Matthews saying he gets a thrill up his leg when he sees Obama then he said a
[33:44.360 --> 33:48.200]  few weeks ago that Obama is a perfect specimen and then Piers Morgan
[33:48.200 --> 33:55.440]  Chonbin and said he's a perfect male specimen I mean these guys are literally
[33:55.440 --> 34:00.560]  talking about Barack Obama like he's Marilyn Monroe or something
[34:00.560 --> 34:04.760]  salivating about him like it's in the locker room in there a football team
[34:04.760 --> 34:07.920]  talking about their favorite cheerleader and hey nothing that you know
[34:07.920 --> 34:14.000]  against that for Piers Morgan and Matthews you know both men who are
[34:14.000 --> 34:19.040]  heterosexual the truth is they're just told shell him as a godlike sex symbol
[34:19.040 --> 34:25.040]  and then shell him as the person's gonna give you free cars free houses free
[34:25.040 --> 34:31.120]  everything all you got was an Obama phone so Carlos Slim the dawn of Mexico
[34:31.120 --> 34:37.680]  the literal leader of the organized command corruption could make billions
[34:37.680 --> 34:46.120]  of dollars off Obama phones billions of dollars off of Obama phones and then
[34:46.120 --> 34:49.240]  when I had the Obama phone lady here that was like a year ago she's gonna be
[34:49.240 --> 34:53.120]  in the Obama deception to interviews you've never seen she's like no my
[34:53.120 --> 34:56.680]  checks got more money coming out of it and I'm getting hammered and we need to
[34:56.680 --> 34:59.680]  get her back on like I want to get her back on in the new year maybe fly her
[34:59.680 --> 35:03.680]  back here with Harvey her husband really nice lady fun to hang out with but she
[35:03.680 --> 35:08.360]  says on tape she goes no it's worse she said on the show she said man the new
[35:08.360 --> 35:15.320]  taxes is eating the hell out of me to quote her and that's what makes you mad
[35:15.320 --> 35:18.800]  when you actually analyze the facts they raise taxes on poor people more than
[35:18.800 --> 35:23.240]  anybody else that poor woman works two jobs and can't make it for her and her
[35:23.240 --> 35:26.920]  kids and I don't blame her wanting a free phone or something you pay enough
[35:26.920 --> 35:31.040]  taxes in but see it's all designed to make you totally poor and then you just
[35:31.040 --> 35:36.080]  go ahead and give up and go on welfare what's the point
[35:36.880 --> 35:41.320]  and then now Barbara Walters comes out and says on Obama we thought he was

[39:02.040 --> 39:05.160]  with a bunch of big Texans who just thought they were with a movie star and
[39:05.160 --> 39:08.720]  Rove had his wife there and these other women and it was like a being in a
[39:08.720 --> 39:12.440]  skexy dinner and I said hey get us the check we're out of here and they said
[39:12.440 --> 39:17.880]  no sir we understand believe me it's on the house and I literally left the

[39:22.080 --> 39:26.000]  eaten at about 8 a.m. it was about 7 30 at night after the Sunday radio show and
[39:26.000 --> 39:30.800]  I had to physically leave because of the clicking and the chirping and the
[39:30.800 --> 39:38.840]  noises I've never heard before and I know he listens he lives in Austin I
[39:38.840 --> 39:42.480]  people his neighbors told me Rove walks around talking trash about me he's a

[39:50.680 --> 39:54.080]  Obama's run in the show and he's even worse because he's actually got
[39:54.080 --> 39:59.360]  followers Carl Rove is a degenerating commodity exposed by the Republican
[39:59.360 --> 40:06.680]  Party and done Carl Rove's over Obama and his legacy of evil has just begun so

[40:21.980 --> 40:27.040]  struggling so much to really fulfill the great flame of ambition and excitement
[40:27.040 --> 40:32.160]  that he was elected on originally in 2009 well you've touched on it to a degree
[40:32.160 --> 40:36.800]  he made so many promises we thought that he was going to be I shouldn't say

[47:16.360 --> 47:21.320]  right now let's start going to your phone calls Carl is calling in from
[47:21.320 --> 47:26.800]  Washington State you're on the air Carl thanks for calling in hey Alex hey
[47:26.800 --> 47:33.600]  brother can you hear me yes I can okay I just had a couple questions on the
[47:33.600 --> 47:39.320]  has anybody besides myself noticed that every time they start pushing the gun
[47:39.320 --> 47:45.200]  control laws again that there's all of a sudden more shootings am I just paranoid
[47:45.200 --> 47:50.040]  or what and no you're not paranoid they've got algorithms where the
[47:50.040 --> 47:54.120]  national directives through ABC CBS NBC CNN even most of them don't even
[47:54.120 --> 47:58.680]  understand this they can promote mass shootings in movies and TV shows and do
[47:58.680 --> 48:02.920]  reports on it and statistically they know through ambient mind control and
[48:02.920 --> 48:07.160]  suggestion with highly suggestible people on psychotropic drugs playing
[48:07.160 --> 48:12.040]  shoot-em-up video games that a certain demographic statistically will go out and
[48:12.040 --> 48:16.040]  conduct a mass shooting there's been studies out decades ago that when they
[48:16.040 --> 48:20.960]  had lots of shows about people shooting cops in movies people will then commit
[48:20.960 --> 48:25.600]  suicide by cop because the idea was introduced to them a famous example of
[48:25.600 --> 48:29.520]  this is they knew this since the 20s with first skyscrapers have been built
[48:29.520 --> 48:33.640]  when someone would jump off a skyscraper to commit suicide if the news covered it
[48:33.640 --> 48:37.680]  suddenly within hours of it being published in newspapers and then in TV it
[48:37.680 --> 48:42.120]  was worse there would be droves of people sometimes two or three at a time
[48:42.120 --> 48:47.560]  trying to jump off because of the idea so if they promote mass shooting even
[48:47.560 --> 48:52.560]  though it's way down and shootings period are down to a 20-year low it will
[48:52.560 --> 48:56.720]  still create though the events they can hype up but then sometimes they actually
[48:56.720 --> 48:59.920]  stage them themselves and have government you know top Air Force
[48:59.920 --> 49:04.040]  commanders handling known people that then say they were drugged and under
[49:04.040 --> 49:09.800]  mind control so does that answer your question yeah I'm another question of
[49:09.800 --> 49:15.400]  you get time sir I'd love to answer your questions you mentioned this last week
[49:15.400 --> 49:23.520]  about four states banning basically banning all firearms and my question
[49:23.520 --> 49:28.800]  is man we how do we stop that because if they do enough states there won't be
[49:28.800 --> 49:33.240]  anybody with any guns quite well yeah here's what's happening federally you
[49:33.240 --> 49:37.320]  can't take people's guns but the feds aren't challenging a lot of states that
[49:37.320 --> 49:41.280]  are restricting guns and even when the feds ruled in DC heller four years ago
[49:41.280 --> 49:47.440]  almost five years ago now hard to believe that Chicago New York DC have to
[49:47.440 --> 49:52.360]  let people own guns they just aren't doing it they're telling the federal
[49:52.360 --> 49:57.880]  government and gun owners to you know what up a rope and so it shows how the
[49:57.880 --> 50:03.640]  feds again it's what you have a federal and state government because then if the
[50:03.640 --> 50:06.640]  feds are out of line the state supply pressure if the states are out of line
[50:06.640 --> 50:10.120]  the feds apply pressure it's a separation of powers while you have a
[50:10.120 --> 50:16.280]  legislative executive and judicial that are co-equal in the modern sense really
[50:16.280 --> 50:19.640]  before a hundred years ago it was legislative was more powerful because it
[50:19.640 --> 50:23.360]  was lawmakers and there was more of them and more separation of power within
[50:23.360 --> 50:28.480]  that then there was the courts then the presidency the president only had power
[50:28.480 --> 50:32.540]  in a co-equal status during a time of war that's why perpetual states of
[50:32.540 --> 50:37.160]  emergency have been brought in since the 1933 war powers act by Franklin Delano
[50:37.160 --> 50:43.480]  Roosevelt anything else sir one one more question I'm watching the state is
[50:43.480 --> 50:50.080]  pretty much a liberal democratic state and I'm fighting that all the time I'm
[50:50.080 --> 50:54.600]  trying to get the message out but what I don't understand is how you can see so
[50:54.600 --> 51:01.000]  much stuff going on and under mind control they're in a cult rather the
[51:01.000 --> 51:05.640]  facts are in the studies are legion sodium fluoride and other toxic members
[51:05.640 --> 51:09.920]  of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the
[51:09.920 --> 51:14.240]  American people so why are the social engineers adding it to the water
[51:14.240 --> 51:18.040]  simple dumb down the host population that the parasitic
[51:18.040 --> 51:22.200]  technocracy is feeding on we may not have been able to get fluoride out of the
[51:22.200 --> 51:26.480]  water supply yet but we can help to get it out of our bodies I am extremely
[51:26.480 --> 51:31.080]  excited to announce the exclusive info wars line fluoride shield formulation
[51:31.080 --> 51:35.840]  fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to
[51:35.840 --> 51:39.800]  help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body but a
[51:39.800 --> 51:44.080]  whole host of toxic substances let's take a stand against the globalist by

[54:18.400 --> 54:30.040]  dragging on but that train keeps rolling on down the sand and toe we're back
[54:30.040 --> 54:36.080]  live by the way ladies and gentlemen about three days ago I had a lady with
[54:36.080 --> 54:41.280]  her children come up to me on the street outside of a restaurant and say man we
[54:41.280 --> 54:45.480]  got your nation iodine a couple months ago and we already supplement but this
[54:45.480 --> 54:49.880]  stuff is really incredible and Gucci already was in Whole Foods last night
[54:49.880 --> 54:54.600]  and a man with his children came over and he knows who he is and was just
[54:54.600 --> 54:58.560]  ranting and raving about the difference between this and other supplements
[54:58.560 --> 55:02.240]  and you've heard the callers call in even though we don't really ask for that
[55:02.240 --> 55:08.040]  and all we've gotten is positive feedback on this proprietary nation iodine
[55:08.040 --> 55:11.880]  that is truly atomic that doesn't mean radioactive it just means it said it's
[55:11.880 --> 55:18.720]  base molecular structure that's why it turns blue purple on paper not black or
[55:18.720 --> 55:23.880]  red like bound iodine and I'm not knocking bound iodine it breaks down
[55:23.880 --> 55:29.920]  your body and is good this stuff is unbelievable for what it's done for me
[55:29.920 --> 55:34.520]  and my family my skin my thyroid my mind it's just a godsend and I'm so glad
[55:34.520 --> 55:38.400]  that this is because I kept saying I come on vitamins minerals down the road
[55:38.400 --> 55:41.400]  so I can make sure they have the highest quality but I just kind of kept putting
[55:41.400 --> 55:44.760]  off busy then when I tried this from a tiny little company that nobody even
[55:44.760 --> 55:49.640]  knew about and it blew me away I said I'm proud of labeling this and that was

[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:52.560]  prisoner planet subscriber here and on call about a pretty much a consistent
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:56.600]  topic on your show which is basically this the crumbling of society and
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:01.600]  particularly youth society like today you know people judge success by the
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:04.480]  number of likes that you have or the number of followers and it just seems
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:08.880]  like we've got it all wrong you know I judge success on how much you can make
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:13.640]  me laugh if you're my friend or how true you are and how honorable people have
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:17.040]  been totally trained to go off-surface because they watch television all day
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:21.760]  and believe it's all about blame go ahead oh exactly like you know we have
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:25.640]  something someone out here like Justin Bieber or whatever you know he he gets
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:29.000]  caught sleeping with prostitutes and there's still fathers out here that are
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.360]  buying their daughters tickets to to a show you know like something something is
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:37.920]  wrong here and I feel like you're taking the approach to make you know believing
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:41.640]  in the Constitution and you know knowing our rights you're making it cool to do
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:45.640]  that and I feel like you know artists and people that are influential need to
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:51.440]  start stepping it up and not just you know help make Obama a sex icon but you
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:55.800]  know tell it how it is well I mean this is really the age of fraud is what it is
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:59.680]  they just put a BBC news headline up that blew me away I knew that 70 plus
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:04.240]  percent of Obama's traffic was web bots and fake but look at this BBC news
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:09.680]  bots now account for 61% of web traffic there's just a war of fraudulent
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:16.320]  traffic we don't do it we don't do it to our sponsors but because news has so
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:21.200]  much fake bots on it news is one of the lowest paying CPMs and web advertising
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:26.320]  and it shows how the fraud system only ends up basically debasing the society
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:30.080]  and what it is is it's inflation inflation of the currency inflation of
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:37.120]  web traffic inflation everything's like a front and then whoever stays genuine
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:43.280]  will end up being king in the end go ahead yeah and I live in metro Detroit so
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:47.800]  you know I'm in the city a lot and you know it's really not that bad when you
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:51.640]  live here you know I've got situations where I've got my car broken into and
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:55.120]  everything but just seeing how you know someone came to power without being
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:58.760]  voted and you know there was no protest that's right they're now
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:03.040]  appointing people up there and they paid to move General Motors to China with the
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:06.600]  bailout money God bless you great caller let's talk to Mark real quick in New
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:11.560]  Jersey says worked at hospital wants to talk about consent forms go ahead yeah
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:16.400]  Alex I worked at a hospital just up until recently when I was let go because I
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:21.520]  really do run my mouth make too many comments about things but one of the
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:28.480]  issues I had was there's a you when you go to the ER and check in you sign a
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:35.360]  consent to receive medical treatment and in the consent after the consent they
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:40.680]  just started what's called a health care information exchange yeah and that's
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:46.240]  what it does it gives Obama and all the corporations now all your health data
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:50.600]  no it gets rid of your privacy in that nice yeah and people are signing this
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:55.160]  willingly not realizing that this puts it out I mean it really puts it out on
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:04:00.680]  it on the internet where by the way they're just trying to get you to
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:05.840]  consent they already give it to everybody under Obama's care but I mean
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:09.600]  can you believe though how hardcore evil that is and that you're a racist because
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:13.640]  you don't like losing your medical records according to Oprah Winfrey if and
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:16.680]  I was open in my mouth I was telling people well I hope you realize by
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:24.320]  signing the second thing you will you give an authorization for third party
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:29.800]  for party people to get your information and that that's that sales that
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:34.360]  pharmaceutical companies that I mean it's everybody it's a it's a it's a
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:40.520]  demographic literally of your health your personal yeah well the Democrats and
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:44.000]  others have tried to deny that but it's in the legislation and all that effect
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.520]  and others say that in the case I mean it's in the waivers it's what's going on
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:53.000]  the death panels are real a manual admits it's meant to take over the
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.400]  health care system great points are people perish for lack of knowledge

[01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:13.880]  radio network
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:29.800]  Ladies and gentlemen we have White House advisors in USA Today and other places
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:35.720]  saying anyone that is a Republican is a member of the Jim Jones cult and I would
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:39.600]  agree if you're a mainline Republican you might as well go join a cult in
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:45.960]  Guyana and drink a cyanide but compared to the mainline Democrats who call
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:50.880]  Obama their savior and Barbara Walters saying they thought he would be the
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:54.960]  messiah that's a quote from Pierce Morgan we played it last hour when she
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:59.480]  was on Pierce Morgan I mean we're talking about real cult like here and by
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:04.400]  the way Politifact we're gonna put it back on screen does report does report
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:10.520]  the Democrats have denied it that it says in the code hidden in the code
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:16.040]  there is a sentence that says you waive any reasonable right to privacy or your
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:26.400]  personal information for the transisting of it or storage of it and it goes on to
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:31.320]  break it all down that that indeed has happened and that's in the new hospital
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:34.440]  admission forms that you waive your rights they're just gonna share it and
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:37.920]  that they're debiting people's accounts with it and the telemarketers are
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:41.320]  calling people and that their death panels and that it's doubling and
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:45.480]  tripling prices and then the architect of it is E. Kilimanual admits that it's
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:48.960]  meant to get rid of the free market health care system this is all on record
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:54.160]  and then if you're informed you're a cult member let me tell you what a cult
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:57.360]  member is is the East German Stasi putting up with that tyranny and carrying
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:01.720]  it out and now Merkel says the NSA is like the Stasi know they're far worse
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:05.720]  and then we've got world net daily Democrat investigate every homeschool
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:10.760]  parent a Democrat state senator Ohio's propose a law that would require every
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:14.520]  homeschooling parent to be investigated and approved by social services see
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:18.520]  before they would be allowed to teach their own children and in Germany they
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:21.920]  arrest people that homeschool even if they have teaching degrees you're not
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:26.520]  allowed to and if they flee to the US Obama sends them back and doesn't give
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:32.160]  them political asylum political prisoner escapee and of course Nazi Germany
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:36.920]  started the practice in Europe this the Russians had done it before of taking
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:41.520]  children and putting them into the state collectives so the homeschool legal
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:45.240]  defense association would get them on calls the bill sponsored by Senator
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:52.640]  Capri Caffero the worst-ever homeschool law proposed SB 248 remember MSNBC says
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:56.880]  in promos your children now belong to the collective now Lou Rockwell the
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:01.160]  chairman of the von Mies Institute of the school of Austrian economics and of
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:07.000]  course former chief of staff for Ron Paul joins us and he also co-hosts and
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.920]  does shows over to Ron Paul channel that I was honored to be on Monday we
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:14.160]  appreciate him coming up on the holidays joining us very busy man he'll be with
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:16.920]  us for about the next 45 minutes we'll go back to your calls and then our next
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:21.280]  guest who's a victim of warrantless DNA checkpoints in Pennsylvania it's
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:23.840]  happening all over the country though
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:29.560]  Pennsylvanians coerced into giving swabs under federal program so this is all
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:35.080]  the bum-rushed tyranny before I get into Obamacare the wars menacing Russia
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:38.520]  where he thinks things are going I want to ask Lou Rockwell of Lou Rockwell
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:43.680]  calm as a really smart guy who has I'm not kissing his eye and it's true great
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:48.840]  gravitas understanding socio-economic and political movements we see a massive
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:53.120]  awakening but we see a bum-rushed by tyranny to to engage in extreme
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:58.800]  exercises of abuse to set the precedent break our will unknown criminal precept
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:04.320]  throughout history so a what does he say about this almost orgy of corruption
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:09.240]  going on and then how do we counter it and where does he see it going and how
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:14.440]  do we avert these different kleptocratic communist Chinese the Russians the the
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:17.360]  insane people that run the West which I would say the most evil of the three
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:22.240]  predatory power groups what do we as individuals worldwide and solidarity with
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:26.200]  free individuals I love Russians I love Chinese I love everybody I know you do
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:30.480]  as well how do we get this love train going to try to counter our psycho
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:35.160]  governments before they start World War three Lou Rockwell well you know one of
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:38.560]  the things that Alex that's been so encouraging has been the reaction of
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:42.480]  people in this country and all around the world about the about Edward Snowden
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:47.280]  one of the great men of American history of course what his leaks have taught us
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:51.360]  about what the government would like to do to us is doing to us and is doing to
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:56.520]  everybody on earth as Glenn Greenwald pointed out in testimony to the EU
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:01.400]  Parliament you know it's the goal of the NSA to abolish individual privacy for
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:05.360]  every person on earth so that's you know there of course not only are they
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:10.760]  totalitarian they're insane as of course if we think of what you know act and
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:16.480]  said about about power there's maybe a third step you know you become insane
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:21.360]  because men and women are not supposed to be exercising this sort of control over
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:26.720]  other people so the people who do it who who lust after power there's a diabolical
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:30.880]  aspect to them but they also go crazy so this is these are the people we're up
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:35.280]  against and I think they can be beaten and I think the key is exactly what you
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:39.560]  mentioned about a solidarity among the peoples of the world against our
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:43.920]  governments so we have a totalitarian government in the US this is no longer a
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:49.560]  free country we still have pockets of freedom but Junty Flynn the great old
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:55.040]  right journalist defined totalitarianism as when a government felt it could do
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:59.560]  whatever it wanted it wasn't necessarily doing everything it wanted to do but it
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:02.560]  there was no no restraints on it so certainly that's the view of the US
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:06.800]  government whether we look at the Obamacare and by the way bad in
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:10.400]  government interventions all government interventions into medical care didn't
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:13.440]  start with Obama didn't start with the Democrats it started with Eisenhower
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:19.040]  Truman actually tried it first Nixon was terrible Reagan was terrible Kennedy
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:23.480]  was terrible Johnson was terrible all these guys are you know you can count
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:27.040]  you can be sure of one thing if any guy gets to be president of the US he's a
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:32.720]  bad guy it's that's just that's just part of his resume so these people have
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:39.480]  totalitarian ambitions for money and power they want money they want sex they
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:43.080]  want all the other things that come with being a top politician but the key
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:47.080]  thing they want is power because if you have power then you can bring about all
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:51.920]  these other things so we have this carbuncle in DC and all its corporate
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:56.360]  allies a raid against the American people similar things in other countries
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:00.920]  but I think Americans are waking up and I must say when I first when it snowed
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:07.880]  and first did his heroic act I thought boy you know it's wonderful for us to
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:11.440]  know this good for us to know what's happening to us but I think Americans are
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:14.440]  such people they're not going to care well that I turned out to be wrong thank
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:19.200]  goodness so it's only a minority of course but everything for good or ill is
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:24.000]  done by my minorities so there is a minority for liberty especially among
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.240]  young people and I credit Ron Paul with being the key guy in this but of course
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:32.760]  there are many great people proceeding Ron Paul building up the edifice of the
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:36.760]  ideas of liberty young people aren't buying this stuff they aren't buying the
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:43.240]  wars they aren't buying the police state they fear the police they worry about the
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:48.680]  police no but really outside of people who work for government if you see a
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:53.720]  policeman you think oh thank goodness I'm going to be safe you know nobody
[01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:57.480]  nobody has that reaction we know they were raid against us so many of them
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:03.000]  of course Iraq and Afghani veterans with PTSD and they see us as a bunch of
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.520]  potential terrorists so but young people are not putting up but there's been a
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:12.840]  real sea change Paul show it I know in the young people you interact with the
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:17.400]  young people that I talked to all the people I talked to who are dealing
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:22.040]  with with the young people they find a huge difference just a huge difference
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:27.240]  and I think that's I think that's our salvation I think the next generation
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:31.440]  and the generation after that are not putting up with this they're not going
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:35.240]  to put up with what those of us in the you know so baby boom generations and
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:40.920]  so forth have put up with so they're I'm very encouraged about the future as
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:46.120]  bad as things are right now and of course the government they want every dime
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:49.800]  we've got they want to know every thought in your head they want to know
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:56.360]  everywhere you go they want to you know it's somebody recently referred to it
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:17:00.280]  you know turned out that Orwell's 1984 was an instruction man exactly rather
[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:05.920]  than a novel but it's actually this is even a worse situation than 1984 and
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:10.000]  the boobs are still saying hey we're number one we're the freest we're the
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.360]  most prosperous we're the best you know it's not it's of course it's not true
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:17.080]  but the view that the US is the best and it's the US government they always are
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:20.880]  talking about when they say the US they're not talking about companies and
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:26.920]  wonderful families and wonderful charity they never say the individual is a
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:30.880]  man it is amazing in the American experience and was the best worldwide
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:35.600]  no one doubted that globally now we're the best tyranny and the most unhealthy
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:39.680]  and the most dumb down because we have the biggest state the world has ever
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:45.160]  seen with a bunch of delusional control freaks who literally think they're
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:49.520]  about to carve this country up and the biggest empire the world has ever seen
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:53.080]  it's not only the biggest state here at home it's it's the global state which
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:18:00.160]  of course has even ambitions to control the solar system so they there there's
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:03.240]  nothing that's beyond them and it's always important to remember when we're
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:09.480]  dealing with the state nothing is beyond them any evil any any any horrible
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:12.640]  thing that they might contemplate doing if they don't if they don't do some
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:16.480]  great evil it's only because they haven't thought of it or they felt it was not in
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:19.640]  their interest or they felt they couldn't carry it out but it's never the
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:25.160]  reaction oh we can't do that it's wrong that's never never their reaction so
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:29.560]  this is a very bad bunch of people their thieves their murderers they're guilty of
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:33.880]  all kinds of crimes and maybe the great libertarian insight is just because
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:37.000]  you're in a government suit just because you work for the government just
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.400]  because you have a bunch of little medals on your chest or a badge on your
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:44.520]  pocket or whatever doesn't mean that you're above the moral law we are all
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:48.680]  subject to the same moral law so the things Alex that are illegal for you and
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:53.760]  me and rightly illegal murder theft kidnapping and so forth don't become
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:57.960]  public policy when creeps from the government do them they're criminals
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:01.400]  they're criminals well you rock well I think what's really backfiring on them
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:03.480]  and I want to come back from right and get your take on this and cover some of
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:06.920]  the issues is that they're trying to treat us all like we're criminals and
[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:11.200]  give us not just all this race-baiting guilt but also guilt like we could all
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:15.080]  be terrorist and everyone really instinctively knows hey I'm not a perp
[01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:20.320]  statistically governments more of a perp quit treating me like I'm scum that's
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:24.680]  right that's right where you know I hope that the American people have had it
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:28.320]  and they're not going to put up with it anymore we're gonna come back with Lou
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:31.040]  Rockwell who rockwell.com he is the chairman of the Von Mies Institute I
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:34.040]  want to look at the economy with you when we come back what's happening in the
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:38.240]  real economy I travel the nation it's rotting it's falling apart and all the
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:41.240]  real numbers show that we've got all these cook statistics how long can the
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:45.960]  facade stay up I don't think it's up 6% approval rating for Congress Chalcescu
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:49.880]  was more popular than that Romania I mean I think cancer is more popular than
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:54.200]  Congress right now so our gonorrhea at least we're gonna be right back with

[01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:53.480]  today with the new world order making rapid advances on every front it is
[01:23:53.480 --> 01:24:17.200]  essential to prepare with my patriot supply today
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:33.440]  you know a big part of this Alex Jones here back live is that we've been so
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:37.760]  nice to government and and been over to it for so long that it literally thinks
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:43.480]  we're owned by it but corporations if you price check at Walmart they threaten
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:48.200]  to arrest you and threaten to put you on a ban list and our own crew member went
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:51.360]  over there by a box fan a few months ago we have video of this and they said let
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.960]  me check your receipt he goes here it is the guy said let me see and he said no
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:58.520]  I'm leaving and the guy said I've called the police they're waiting outside and
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:03.760]  you'll be banned from any corporate store ever again that's on video and it
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:08.320]  just shows this arrogant hateful attitude this predatory attitude and we
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:12.280]  see federal checkpoints taking DNA under intimidation we've got a victim of
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:16.120]  this coming up the next hour we see coal power plants that are brand new and
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:20.440]  clean like Wolverine we're gonna play that later getting shut down and we see
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:27.520]  government with fake court cases using NSA data in court cases and creating fake
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:32.040]  briefs for the juries of where they got evidence just organized crime and
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:35.840]  Leroc will what is the excuse on average in government that I want to get into
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:40.320]  the economy in this brief segment with you what is the excuse because so many
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:43.560]  people in government now actually believe doing corrupt things are good
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:47.760]  because they're good when that's not really the case or they actually
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:51.720]  consciously are just criminals and what do we do when they had hearings two
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:56.360]  weeks ago in Congress with Jonathan Turley the liberal and conservatives from
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:26:00.560]  other groups saying we may have to revolt physically I don't want that they
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:04.440]  were saying though under the Declaration of Independence it could come down to
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:08.840]  that I mean this is an amazing time to be alive when in the face of the public
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:14.440]  waking up government doubles down well I think Alex we do have to revolt I don't
[01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:18.960]  think that we can use violence killing people putting people in cages
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:24.840]  torturing people tasering people you know that's the way of government that's
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:28.680]  not our way our way is the peaceful way our way is the way of withdrawing
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:35.280]  consent and of laughing at them and of the hate by the way being laughed at the
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:38.400]  government has no sense of humor people who work for the government have no
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:42.680]  sense of humor but it's a very effective tactic and we have to if we get
[01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:47.480]  enough people refusing to play the game then government can't actually work
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:52.320]  against us but you know if if if if anybody were to threaten them with
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:56.200]  violence they're happy to kill you and maybe your family and maybe your whole
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:27:00.640]  neighborhood too so you know that's maybe things do come down to that at some
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:05.000]  time in the future I hope not but I think there's a lot we can do in the
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:09.240]  meantime without taking part in government activities and we always have
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:14.940]  to remember that these are you know these are a bunch of criminals and my
[01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:19.160]  guess is at least most of them don't think of themselves as criminals they
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:22.440]  think of those cells as people who are protecting the common good they think
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:26.880]  they really know more about taking care of your children than you do and really
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:30.840]  the government owns your children they believe that and the government owns
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:35.120]  your business the government owns you government owns your house they you know
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:39.800]  they own every they own your church they own every aspect of your life and you
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:46.440]  better obey but I think more and more people are going crazy about the kind
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:51.760]  of tyranny that they're facing they're learning more they're reading more it's
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:55.640]  always essential to learn some real economics some real history some real
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:59.840]  political philosophy of the kind they do not teach in the government schools so
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:06.320]  that you can be intellectually armed I this is what young people are doing it's
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:10.320]  important to read books the government doesn't want you reading serious books
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:16.680]  but it's important to do so and I think there's a tremendous movement towards
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:20.920]  freedom sort of going under the surface and the people in government sort of
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:26.240]  feel things shaky into their feet it's why they're constantly scared of us you
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:30.760]  notice they're all scared whether it's the TSA in the airport or a bureaucrats
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:36.320]  in a government office or the military or the CIA or the EPA or the tax police
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:42.200]  or you know the FDA going on the alphabet from hell they all fear the
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:46.280]  people and it's not because they fear a bunch of people coming into the guns
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:50.320]  that's you know they they feel very confident that's not gonna happen but
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:58.120]  they fear our disobedience they fear our non-respect they fear our refusal to
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:02.360]  kowtow to them well that's why the mafia always wants you to quote respect them
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:06.200]  that means fear them and do what they say and that's what government and TV
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:11.120]  everything is about you're being watched we can get you you're powerless do what
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:15.200]  we say because we are the food you know that's right I hate to smear the mafia
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:18.960]  by comparing them to the government but you're right you're right it's exactly
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:24.000]  it's exactly the same process and they really enjoy us you know
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:28.400]  salaming them and they enjoy killing people these are these are these are not
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:32.280]  good types the people who rise to power in government at FAA Hayek said that
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:36.840]  unlike in in private life the worst rise to the top in government the worst
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:40.800]  people come to power and they are you know they're the most rotten so it's not
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:44.600]  the average postman or fireman or whatever we have to worry about but the
[01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:47.960]  top guys in government absolutely stay there rockwell amazing we'll be right

[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:45.160]  those sponsors and letting them know why you support those sponsors because
[01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:48.400]  they want to bring a tyranny in to have a controlled economy because they're
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:52.840]  afraid of the markets you voting with your dollars your euros your currency
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:57.240]  and then moving them seismically I want to actually rock well about this 20
[01:36:57.240 --> 01:37:00.560]  years ago you couldn't find organic food anywhere except in a few little
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:05.240]  shops and it was very expensive because the market hadn't been built up and it
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:09.200]  was cost prohibitive now because people slowly supported it it's coming down to
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:14.520]  parody with the garbage food that's a prime example of a libertarian von
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:21.000]  Mies type revolution as an economist as a researcher break down how we could
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.600]  take things back by supporting each other and local communities and farmers
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:31.040]  markets and the von Mies Institute or the Ron Paul channel and promoting the
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:36.800]  new media making it the dominant media which were very very close to doing
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:40.320]  versus this globalist revolution and then I want to tie that into Mark
[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:45.720]  Fawber says the Fed will never end QE he said they don't see NBC last night and
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:50.800]  some other economic news I want to get into you but let's talk about that Lou
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:54.560]  Rockwell because you are an expert on it how do we use our choices voting with
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:59.360]  our dollars to take society back and then overall economic outlook well Alex
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:04.000]  you're exactly right that you know what you eat is essential you want to stay
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.280]  out of these government hospitals where all the sicknesses you probably want to
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:11.320]  stay away from a lot of these doctors who were just agents of the government
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:16.400]  and want to put you on a bunch of big pharma drugs so it's it's it meezes in
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:20.600]  his book socialism written so many years ago said socialize them one of the
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:26.160]  worst effects of socialize medicine is that it that it circumscribes and
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:31.160]  takes away the will to health and you know this one of the lies of the
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:34.440]  government is they they claim they're providing health care it's not health
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:38.720]  care health care is with you within your own control what they're providing is
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:43.680]  allegedly sickness medicine and of course it's getting worse and worse it's
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:47.520]  getting more and more dangerous the drugs are more and more dangerous they
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:51.760]  cause more and more sickness so if you can do anything possible to stay out of
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:58.000]  a hospital is that of a regular doctor's office you know it you live longer you
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:03.480]  feel better everything is much better and the the cornerstone of that is what
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:08.080]  you eat so it seems to me that's the first thing you can do I like the
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:11.840]  primal diet but you know whatever whatever people whatever works for people
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:15.600]  you know that's what they should do but you have to take responsibility for
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:21.000]  yourself and what you eat in what you store in all you know how you live your
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:25.680]  life exercise all those kinds of things you can't look to that to Obama or the
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:31.600]  reservoir you know Dr. Emanuel one of the monsters of of socialized medicine in
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:37.040]  the whole world who was put in charge of this this whole evil program but it's
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:40.800]  not I should also say really when I call it socialist medicine it's actually not
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:45.560]  socialist medicine it's fascist medicine because it's the big companies in
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:49.720]  the healthcare industry in the pharmaceutical industry in the insurance
[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:53.840]  industry in cahoots with the government against the rest of us so it's a
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:59.600]  classic fascist operation of Obamacare but look at the opposition to it they
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:03.040]  not only because they were incompetent but more and more the people study it
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:06.400]  they see what's happening there's a there's a you know there's a revolution
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:10.760]  going on in opposition to this thing so I think they're going to have a lot of
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:15.480]  trouble not just technically because of course they're all the government is you
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:20.520]  know composed of a lot of boobs sometimes they sometimes have unfortunately
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:26.040]  smart people producing killer robots and and atomic bombs and all their other
[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:29.480]  things they certainly don't produce anything anybody needs or is good for
[01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:33.720]  society or is good for the flourishing of human beings they're the they're the
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:37.600]  great center of opposition to the flourishing of human beings except of
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:42.680]  course for themselves for the 1% maybe the tenth of all of 1% is the actual
[01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:46.000]  let's talk about the economy again we have the chairman of the Von Mies
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:50.840]  Institute on whose research in Austrian economics are proving absolutely accurate
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:55.720]  and the true veritas compared to the Keynesian fraud and other systems what
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:41:00.240]  is the position of the world economy based on the numbers you've got and all
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:04.080]  the economists you work with as the head of your prestigious organization some of
[01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:10.040]  the top economists in the world you know now basically adopting of this school of
[01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:15.160]  thought what is the real state of the economy well I think we all fear what
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:19.160]  did you say what Mark Fawber said last night that they'll never give up on QE
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:24.880]  but they don't actually want hyperinflation hyperinflation is not
[01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:28.120]  good for the people at the top it's not good for the government they couldn't
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:32.240]  care less that it's bad for regular people but it's bad for them it's very
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:36.480]  destabilizing so I don't think they actually want it on the other hand
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:40.800]  they're so arrogant that they're capable of doing things because I think they
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:44.240]  know better they think there's no such thing as economic law they can just do
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:47.920]  whatever they want and have whatever impact they they want it to have and
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:54.480]  you know nothing bad happens so it is possible to have hyperinflation we're
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:59.040]  already seeing as anybody who goes shopping knows it's not just you know
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:03.840]  2% or 3% inflation when you look at what food is going up by it's much much
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:09.040]  higher than that that's true who there's already a lot of inflation the real
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:12.720]  definition of inflation and in terms of the increase in the money supply this is
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:19.280]  leading to higher prices already and what point that explodes you know I wish I
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:24.960]  knew I'd be rich but it's it's coming exactly I want you to continue but just
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:29.320]  to back you up here's a CNS news even though they're adding more awful into
[01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:34.640]  the ground beef the pink slime in the last decade to cover up inflation price
[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:38.880]  of ground beef hits all-time high and it's only going up and every staple is
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:42.640]  going up and people I know in my family that have been middle-class lower
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:47.280]  middle-class upper middle-class they're on the verge of being destitute across
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:51.720]  Texas I've got family that's having trouble making ends meet for the first
[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:56.720]  time ever and almost everyone else I know is having big problems and people
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:43:00.240]  are having to move in with their parents and vice versa I mean I think we're
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:04.560]  really under a depression and you travel the country this nation is rotting
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:09.600]  unless you're in DC where they report they're making record profits and having
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:13.800]  their salaries increase Leroc will and their houses are the most beautiful and
[01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:18.440]  I don't I don't advocate visiting Washington because it's a it's a very
[01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:22.320]  bad place but if you ever happen to find yourself there look at how they live
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:27.520]  this is just like the capital in catching fire or in hunger games and the
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:31.400]  rest of us out here in the districts indeed are hurting and I think all of
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:36.880]  us know we all feel it even if we you know don't know economics or studying
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:41.280]  the economy we all feel there's something drastically wrong economically we
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:46.040]  fear for our children's future we fear for our grandchildren's future so there
[01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:50.440]  is real trouble on the other hand these things can be fixed but they require
[01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:54.560]  massive reform of the people in Washington and all their agencies and
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:58.920]  all the big corporations associated with them I think I think again this is
[01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:05.240]  coming my fear is we've got some years of very tough times ahead it's why you
[01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:09.000]  know you're right to get people to want to store some food in their houses and
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:13.400]  and that sort of thing because we don't entirely know what's going to happen we
[01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:16.800]  we can know already bad things are happening things are going to get worse
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:20.480]  but I again I don't think this is anything permanent sure I think I think I
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:23.560]  think these people are going to be pushed back I think we're going to do it
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:27.000]  but you got to be ready for bad stuff in the meantime
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.240]  Lou Rockwell again chairman of the bombies Institute I always get you up
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:36.000]  here and I ask the questions but but I want to spend a few minutes on what you
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.480]  want to say I mean what did you wake up this morning thinking about politically
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:44.280]  economically and then I want to get into I'm not romanticizing Russia by any
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:47.880]  means but they're trying to move in the direction of free market from what I've
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:53.560]  seen though they're stumbling versus centralization here the West is rolling
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:56.600]  missiles up to their border so they roll missiles up to their border and oh how
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:45:00.120]  dare you I mean I look at how the government rolled out Obamacare and
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:05.120]  they are incompetent many levels are they gonna cause a nuclear war my gut
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:08.480]  tells me I see signs of war everywhere so I want to get to that but first what
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:11.720]  else is on your mind what else you want to tell our vast audience of Patriots
[01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:18.360]  well Alex I'll just you know talk about Russia for a minute and Putin I was
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:22.840]  never a fan of Putin but seems to me he's doing a much better job of things
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:29.800]  than say Obama is doing he did prevent along with the American people the
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:33.880]  an attack on a worse attack on Syria Obama's men his cohorts have been
[01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:38.520]  attacking Syria for some time but they didn't bomb it so far they haven't bombed
[01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:43.240]  Iran and I think that's China and Russia preventing that from happening
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:47.080]  Iran a country that's never done anything to anybody but yet we're supposed to
[01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:54.240]  destroy them so that's not happening it's I see people who criticize Putin for
[01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:58.120]  going around without a shirt because he looks great but also they don't like the
[01:45:58.120 --> 01:46:03.120]  fact that it shows the crucifix around his neck so I don't know it's it's maybe
[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:06.560]  it's all just a political trick maybe he's just a politician like all the rest
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:11.720]  of them but Russia has moved dramatically towards freedom from the days of
[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:17.120]  Soviet communism no you're right huge huge influence in in the whole world and
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:21.520]  so the US wants to shut them down Reagan had promised Gorbachev that if the
[01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:26.160]  Russians withdrew the US would not move NATO up to the Russian borders of course
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:30.760]  the US didn't keep its word that's exactly all these aggressive moves but
[01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:36.520]  they still fear Russia they still fear China and I hope to goodness you know
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:43.920]  this the neocons all want perpetual war a war with Russia and China course could
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:48.680]  be the end of the world so but these guys are crazy the neocons are insane in
[01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:52.760]  addition to being evil so I don't know but I I'm following what's happening in
[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:58.200]  Russia the tax rates are lower than ours and just you know it's a religion has
[01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:03.120]  sprung back really never was crushed by Stalin and by and Lenin the rest of the
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:07.360]  communists they maybe crush the outer ship the outer view and Putin points out
[01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:12.240]  that his mother hadn't baptized as a baby in secret which I'm sure a lot of
[01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:16.920]  Russian mothers did exactly the same thing so religion is back and I don't
[01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:19.840]  know the whole it's just a very very interesting to watch and certainly they
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:23.200]  have a they have a right to live their own lives internationally the US
[01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:26.360]  government has no right to tell the Russians what they should be doing
[01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:29.440]  because they don't have the right to tell us what we were doing either they
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:32.800]  have no right to tell the Chinese to what to be doing or the Indians or
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:37.720]  anybody else the Brazilians the Argentinians the Chileans but there's
[01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:41.760]  more just like there's more and more resistance here and just like even a
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:44.800]  tyrannical government depends on the consent of the government because they're
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:48.920]  such a small minority as compared to the people so does an empire require the
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:53.400]  exactly of the provinces in the world they're they're losing that consent
[01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:57.880]  they've lost that consent so I think there's you know great interesting times
[01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:02.760]  ahead but we just have to pray that you know those interesting times don't
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:07.400]  include a world war Ron Paul has said over and over again it's been proven
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:12.000]  pressing it the key is when the socialist fascist system on top of it
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:17.880]  collapses that they're gonna try to totally take over with a system even
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:22.200]  worse on top of that we've got a point out they did this and clearly they did
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:29.440]  it that's right so how do we maximize this key no man's land in history where
[01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:33.440]  the future is being dictated I mean what should young people but also just
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:37.040]  everybody out there we have a great activist audience what should people be
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:44.200]  doing right now because soon things are gonna intensify and we're going into
[01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:47.360]  this in a good position now because you and so many others fought for decades
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:52.160]  to educate people about true Americana ideas true liberty ideas true renaissance
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:57.120]  ideas but blue rock well what do we do now to maximize going into this great
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:01.840]  time of change to like a judo move take their assault on liberty step out of the
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:06.600]  way and watch them fly out the window well Alex we need to emulate you we need
[01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:11.600]  to emulate writers everybody should have a blog everybody should have a YouTube
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:16.520]  channel if you're concerned and of course the local people let's take the
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:20.960]  local people in Ohio are concerned about this horrific Kosovia style law that
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:25.920]  the those state senators are proposing to have the social workers they are the
[01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:29.280]  armed and monster social workers of child protective services come in and
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:31.880]  try to tell parents what to do with their children and give them permission to
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:35.760]  homeschool so there ought to be a blog about that somebody who actually knows
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:40.240]  the situation on the ground you can do commentaries with YouTube you can write
[01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:44.600]  and first you have to read now this is you know not an instant thing but of
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:48.560]  course if you want to be if you want people to listen to you you have to
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:51.880]  gain knowledge here's an example here's an example and I did this years ago and I
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:56.720]  had time if you actually start following the family court and covering CPS
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:50:02.480]  there just as a citizen on access TV you know 18 years ago they were committing
[01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:05.840]  so many crimes and not even putting the right name on fake paperwork and making
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:09.720]  stuff up I would come in with citizen briefs and cover it people would get
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:13.360]  their kids back that never would have but it was so painful I could only do it
[01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:17.880]  for a while because watching the evil judges in the in the CPS were clearly
[01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:22.920]  pervs it was so upsetting that I'll be honest I'm not afraid of physical
[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:29.160]  confrontation things but being around the evil I was actually a coward to be
[01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:35.480]  around the the demonic soft weird pedophiles that are the CPS well you
[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:38.320]  know Alex I mean it's you know it's tough to approach Mordor right it's
[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:41.560]  tough to actually see that stuff so that's why we need it we need you know
[01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:45.920]  many many people involved we can't just leave it up to a few so we all need to
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:49.360]  be involved we all need to learn about local crimes you may not be able to
[01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:52.960]  follow what's going on in Washington but in your own town there are horrors
[01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:56.400]  going on there are just stickable things going on stay right there we're right

[01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:10.880]  and through the woods professional burglars are choosing easy targets to
[01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:16.840]  break into don't be an easy target plug-in fake TV full criminals into
[01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:21.600]  believing someone's home at your house watching TV fake TV works a bit like a
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:26.760]  light on a timer but fake TV is far more convincing fake TV plugs into any
[01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:31.520]  outlet and simulates the light and colors of a real TV burglars will likely
[01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:36.320]  move on to easier targets and leave your house alone fake TV costs less than a
[01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:40.440]  month of most alarm monitoring plans and makes a great Christmas gift or it's

[01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:10.920]  minutes of calls to go to Tony Gus Kenny Jane and Wesley we've been holding
[01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:14.880]  patiently we're gonna get a guest on for about 15 20 minutes who ran into these
[01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:19.200]  illegal warrantless intimidation checkpoints for they take DNA under
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:23.240]  federal auspices turns out they heard us talking about it yesterday and sent us a
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:26.840]  comment that they were the person who was in the news story so we're gonna be
[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:30.380]  talking to them a final segment with Lou Rockwell the chairman of the Von
[01:54:30.380 --> 01:54:34.320]  Mies Institute and of course they run the great news and commentary site that
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:38.600]  promotes liberty and other thought crimes of the Rockwell dot com there's
[01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:42.360]  links to the Von Mies Institute right there on the site but you know I've
[01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:45.960]  started getting tears in my eyes earlier when I started thinking about the CPS
[01:54:45.960 --> 01:54:50.600]  stuff and I know why people don't want to go fight evil because if you actually
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:55.360]  go out there and look at it it's real it's going on and it tears your guts out
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:55:01.700]  but it's only gonna get worse if we the people don't stand up and take action
[01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:05.320]  look at how they're demonizing Christians look at how they're demonizing
[01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:09.880]  the family these really are weirdo control freaks a normal successful
[01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:14.200]  person does not want to run other people's lives and it's so popular they
[01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:19.280]  can't get people away from with a stick the government and corporate types that
[01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:24.240]  engage in these takeovers through inside deals literally are people that in a
[01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:28.120]  natural environment as you've documented sir couldn't be toilet
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:32.640]  attendance so in closing how do we have a fundamental revolution of ideas against
[01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:36.520]  them and how do we bring them to justice and build a better world based on
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:41.360]  individualism and free choice and communication and real community not
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:46.040]  communism well Alex just like the market is composed of you know billions of
[01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:50.680]  transactions and millions of people cooperating together so is the liberty
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:55.160]  movement and there are many things people can do that may not occur immediately as
[01:55:55.160 --> 01:56:00.400]  great steps for liberty but but they are for example most of us have teenagers
[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:04.640]  or younger children and our families that we need Christmas presents for well
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:09.000]  how about giving them the susan Collins the hunger game trilogy this is a great
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:15.520]  beautifully written three volume books that very libertarian inspiring for kids
[01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:20.480]  to read but adults to by the way or you people a copy of Henry Hazlitz economic
[01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:24.760]  someone lesson or Murray Rothboards for new liberty there are all kinds of great
[01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:28.840]  books that that you can give depending on the person's you know age and
[01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:33.440]  educational level and so forth so just if you're a Johnny Apple seed of great
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:38.040]  literature for freedom this Christmas boy you've done something very very good
[01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:43.000]  and everybody it's the division of labor not all of us can go and sit in the
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:48.160]  CPS hearings and not all of us can run a great radio network and so forth we all
[01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:52.000]  we all have different things to do but we all can do something we have to do
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:56.920]  something and if we all enough of us do something something good for other
[01:56:56.920 --> 01:57:00.920]  people something good for the cause of freedom then we can win it
[01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:05.720]  absolutely Hollywood and the social engineers always have one archetypal
[01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:09.880]  Hercules defeating all the enemies while everyone cowers but real histories made
[01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:13.800]  by little people doing little things that move mountains together so if you
[01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:18.560]  just wake up one person folks a month or if you just resist a tyranny or laugh
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:24.040]  at it or say no to it or don't cower to the system or don't let these corrupt
[01:57:24.040 --> 01:57:28.280]  corporations push you around or don't let them cheat you on a bill being active
[01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:32.320]  getting into the animating contest making it fun to be alive and awake it
[01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:36.640]  will intensify your human spirit we've just got to bring the human spirit back
[01:57:36.640 --> 01:57:41.440]  final comments Lou Rockwell well Alex that's exactly right and we must never
[01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:45.720]  forget no matter how dark things are we have the truth in our side these other
[01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:52.320]  people are the the battleers for lies and for all other kinds of evil we have
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:56.400]  the truth so the truth will win out if we're worthy of it so we should all
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:58:00.720]  seek to be worthy of the truth well said what are you planning to do in the
[01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:05.400]  new year in the fight for liberty well I want to do more to expand what the
[01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:09.640]  Mises Institute is doing we're having I think a tremendous effect on young
[01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:14.600]  people not only of college age but younger we're going to just keep
[01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:17.600]  reaching more and more of them teaching the truth about economics about what
[01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:20.960]  the government is doing to them but the Federal Reserve and all the other
[01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:25.800]  criminal gangs in Washington and we're having great success with our website
[01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:31.120]  we want to do more we want to reach more people and that's our determination
[01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:35.040]  well God bless you we salute you going into the new year thank you so much and

[02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:10.040]  things real quick I just was wondering if you're gonna have or when you're gonna
[02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:14.440]  have a Karen Hudris back on the show she's been coming out with some really
[02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:21.240]  good interviews the last month and remind me who is she Karen Hudris he's the
[02:01:21.240 --> 02:01:25.400]  World Bank whistleblower oh yeah oh yeah I saw on the screen you're talking about
[02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:28.520]  World Bank yeah we had her on the nightly news and here and I think she's
[02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:32.000]  told her tale it's very interesting it just fits in what we already know about
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:36.520]  the World Bank so we might get her back on some time but what's your take on
[02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:46.320]  all the other issues that are taking place you pretty much on point and yeah
[02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:50.800]  that's about all I had to say except that if on some class no you're right for
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:57.000]  your bumper music oh yeah play some clash and what's the name of the song no
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:00.160]  you're right I think I've heard that song it's pretty good song thank you so
[02:02:00.160 --> 02:02:07.720]  much sir all right let's go ahead and talk to Wesley in Mississippi you're on
[02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:14.520]  the air go ahead hey Alex I want to say of course I've said the support but the
[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:18.480]  Nathan iodine and the coffee are absolutely made the coffee man I'm so
[02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:22.720]  glad you came out with this I've been hoping for an organic type coffee I can
[02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:27.480]  trust for a while now and I just hope we can get more of it because it's you know
[02:02:27.480 --> 02:02:32.000]  we're selling a lot of it of the bags we got and it's very popular and it's
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:35.520]  there's only a certain season we can get it I wish I would have bought more from
[02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:40.200]  the Chiapas folks down there but it's my favorite coffee I mean I'm sure you know
[02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:43.600]  on the right day you could find something better somewhere but it's just I've
[02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:48.560]  been drinking this coffee for years and now we've put it out as our own brand so
[02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:52.800]  I'm glad you like it brother yeah I love it well the point I want to make it but
[02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:57.640]  I love how especially in the recent years all the yuppies as you like to
[02:02:57.640 --> 02:03:02.480]  calm it's so excited when they see new movies and new TV shows such as like
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:05.760]  James Williams on the side channel or Morgan Freeman or this almost human
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:09.000]  stuff or they hear about these new technologies claiming that will give us
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:13.400]  superpowers and make us a moral or that's right they're rolling out all the
[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:17.320]  microchips and everything like it's so sexy it'll make you live forever it's
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:22.360]  so cool that's how they're selling the rat poison my two points on this are
[02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:28.600]  like okay first off if you're Christian the electrified tattoos and RFID chip you
[02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:32.200]  know that should have screened more for the bees that you're right there but you
[02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:36.080]  know and number two you're not part of the royal bloodlines you're not part of
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:39.760]  the elite you're not getting this technology this is it for us this is for
[02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:44.920]  them all these immortality and all this you know reading people's minds you're
[02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:49.720]  not getting this buddy you're a peon to them they are the ones who are getting
[02:03:49.720 --> 02:03:53.920]  all this technology so you know stop getting so hyped up about it at this
[02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:57.840]  it's for everybody and it's not gonna be way too well that's right any
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:01.280]  technology we're given has the Trojan horse of surveillance and
[02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:06.040]  microwaving us and controlling us the globalist it's like the great George
[02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:09.080]  Carlin said education will ever get better it'll get worse because the
[02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:12.760]  owners don't want you informed no kidding imagine what George Carlin would say
[02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:17.680]  today with two plus two equals five and that you can misspell and it's still
[02:04:17.680 --> 02:04:21.240]  spelled right I mean it or or if a teacher corrects people that are using
[02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:26.140]  improper English they get fired because you know that you know ebonics is now a
[02:04:26.140 --> 02:04:30.640]  proper language I mean folks say there's ebonics with black folks you
[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:34.120]  ought to go hang out in East Texas with the white people out there that you
[02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:36.880]  know that have their own language that came understand each other it's the
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:41.080]  same deal you're supposed to get rural or ignorant people that don't know how to
[02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:44.720]  speak the proper language and inform them of it not say we're gonna get rid of
[02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:48.200]  language altogether because people couldn't adopt it pretty soon we'll
[02:04:48.200 --> 02:04:53.000]  just be running around like cavemen like Barney Rubble you know to each other

[02:09:08.080 --> 02:09:11.920]  and it's case late news 12 Jeff Bell discovered that clergy would help the
[02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:16.320]  government with potentially their biggest problem us so part of it is we
[02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:19.520]  have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their
[02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:22.960]  parents or kids belong to their families or recognize that kids belong to whole
[02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:28.360]  communities if you got a business that you didn't build that somebody else made

[02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:16.080]  the dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras parents grabbing their
[02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:20.080]  children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then
[02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:24.400]  finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a SWAT officers rifle they
[02:10:24.400 --> 02:10:27.200]  let them in the area they told them they could come in and now they're coming in
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:37.840]  like they're trespassers punching and shoving people
[02:10:37.840 --> 02:10:47.160]  the Empire is on the run live from the info wars dot-com studios it's Alex
[02:10:47.160 --> 02:11:05.480]  Jones and then we've got a guest popping in for about 15 minutes who is the
[02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:16.080]  victim pencil vanyans coerced into giving cheek swab at voluntary checkpoint
[02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:19.960]  but it's not really voluntary this is a big issue happening nationwide drudge
[02:11:19.960 --> 02:11:24.200]  report dot-com carried it yesterday into today like I think it's still up there
[02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:34.000]  now you can find it on the middle column and this is the this is the type of
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:40.080]  tyranny that is going on separately talking about political correctness US Army
[02:11:40.080 --> 02:11:46.360]  War College seeks to remove General Robert E. Lee Stonewall Jackson the
[02:11:46.360 --> 02:11:50.280]  British infantry have studied Stonewall Jackson and and teach at their
[02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:54.320]  main West Point style school that he's the greatest strategy commander of all
[02:11:54.320 --> 02:12:03.440]  time Stonewall Jackson who died in battle and could take forces 10 times
[02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:08.320]  smaller and beat larger forces I mean it's just military strategy but no now
[02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:12.920]  their names must be expunged no one can even see it I mean this is just the
[02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:20.920]  total political correctness that is that is running rampant across this
[02:12:20.920 --> 02:12:25.560]  country and across this world that's some of what's coming up and then more on
[02:12:25.560 --> 02:12:30.400]  Obamacare there's been some big Obamacare level developments so here's a
[02:12:30.400 --> 02:12:35.560]  headline right here out of a newsweek the case that could topple Obamacare and
[02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:38.680]  I'm predicting they're gonna get rid of some of it but not all of it because the
[02:12:38.680 --> 02:12:41.680]  insurance companies and the banks get what they want unless there's enough
[02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:47.400]  heat on this system but right now Kenny has been holding a long time Kenny from
[02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:51.440]  Ohio then we'll go to Jane and any others that are holding Kenny thank you
[02:12:51.440 --> 02:12:55.120]  for calling what is on your mind today on this Wednesday edition hey how you
[02:12:55.120 --> 02:13:00.680]  doing Alex good brother well I think a couple days ago in infowars.com that
[02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:05.960]  Connecticut had passed a bill with the labeling of GMO foods and I have
[02:13:05.960 --> 02:13:10.400]  two quick questions about this my first one will other state follow and when do
[02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:14.400]  you think they will and my second question is I live in Ohio and I live
[02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:19.520]  near Amish country and I've always wondered would it be safer for me my
[02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:24.240]  family to buy and drink the milk that the Amish have and to buy the stuff that
[02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:30.040]  they have at the store well I personally am gonna tell you what I would do
[02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:36.200]  here and you can make your own decision we in this office have both regular
[02:13:36.200 --> 02:13:42.040]  creamer for folks in their coffee organic creamer from the store but it's been
[02:13:42.040 --> 02:13:46.360]  homogenized basically turning the liquid cheese and they boil it ultra
[02:13:46.360 --> 02:13:52.160]  homogenized or pasteurized I guess is the proper word pasteurization boiling
[02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:57.160]  it and then we have Mennonite there it's like Amish light you know not of the
[02:13:57.160 --> 02:14:03.480]  original German slash Swiss folks that came over here 300 years ago and now
[02:14:03.480 --> 02:14:06.800]  are all over the world bringing prosperity to wherever they go great
[02:14:06.800 --> 02:14:11.720]  people the Mennonites are kind of the same deal but are just more of a modern
[02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:18.360]  coalition of grapes or spinoffs and we buy and drink Mennonite milk and I have
[02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:22.320]  Mennonite milk at my house now I would get it from Amish too they were on but
[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:26.360]  excellent and they go to the farmers markets they would come to the Austin
[02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:29.840]  farmers markets and then under free association if you wanted to go to the
[02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:35.360]  back of their van you could buy milk that was milked that morning and there's
[02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:38.440]  any contamination that to throw it all out instead they want ultra
[02:14:38.440 --> 02:14:43.400]  pasteurization so big pharma but you know the big pharma run agribusiness
[02:14:43.400 --> 02:14:46.960]  that's what it is you put the GMO hormones in it you name it the blood can
[02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:52.200]  be in it feces you name it and they boil it to where it kills the bacteria but
[02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:54.760]  they could feed you basically you're getting as much pus sometimes you're
[02:14:54.760 --> 02:14:59.160]  getting milk they make the cows overwork their breasts are twice aside that they
[02:14:59.160 --> 02:15:04.000]  should be the udders are exploding they get all sorts of diseases oh I work for
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:07.000]  a large animal vet so I've gone and worked on dairy cows I'm not gonna
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:12.720]  say anymore it's unbelievable what the big GMO ones do versus the cows they're
[02:15:12.720 --> 02:15:20.000]  taking care of that are very happy and regular milk is not even milk regular
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:26.280]  milk is a is basically garbage and we should with the market demand that we
[02:15:26.280 --> 02:15:31.600]  get whole raw milk but the feds and states have laws blocking it just 50
[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:35.680]  years ago most the milk you would get was raw unpasteurized that the milk man
[02:15:35.680 --> 02:15:39.680]  would drop off it was the best in the world they want stuff that can last
[02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:43.600]  weeks that's why they're going to this super ultra pasteurized that never
[02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:48.520]  basically goes bad like McDonald's food under glass and radiating the meat the
[02:15:48.520 --> 02:15:52.880]  chicken you know the poultry the fish so they don't have to clean it and they
[02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:58.160]  actually spray live virus vaccines as they call them on most the meat now it
[02:15:58.160 --> 02:16:01.200]  causes incredible intestinal disorders they've been doing that for seven years
[02:16:01.200 --> 02:16:05.960]  since the FDA approved it so they can actually feed you rotten chicken rotten
[02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:11.360]  beef rotten you name it they take rotten dead animals put them in giant vats they
[02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:15.560]  call it awful grind it up and feed it to cows they feed blood of slaughtered cows
[02:16:15.560 --> 02:16:20.480]  the calves cows aren't supposed to eat meat folks they're they're they're they're
[02:16:20.480 --> 02:16:26.540]  herbivores pigs are omnivores so are we so there you go as you know a tiger is a
[02:16:26.540 --> 02:16:30.840]  carnivore so I hope that answers your question what was the other one and the
[02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:35.440]  other one was what the Connecticut did with their labeling of GMO foods how
[02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:39.120]  long do you think that other states will follow exactly what Connecticut has
[02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:44.800]  done well I haven't really been following the Connecticut situation guys we
[02:16:44.800 --> 02:16:48.480]  searched and see Connecticut votes for labeling I had to show my ignorance I
[02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:50.560]  wasn't even aware of that I know they were having a battle I know that it
[02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:55.760]  happened yet I know California failed via fraud and and lobbying by big
[02:16:55.760 --> 02:17:00.080]  corporations and I know Oregon just failed unfortunately in other states but I
[02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:04.080]  think we should just vote with our eyeballs and only try to get what is
[02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:07.720]  organic but I appreciate your call really really good points yeah there it
[02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:12.240]  is this is the time Connecticut government signs first GMO labeling laws in
[02:17:12.240 --> 02:17:20.280]  US and that happened four days ago five days ago so very good news from AFP all
[02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:24.800]  right let's jam another call thank you for holding Jane you're on the air go
[02:17:24.800 --> 02:17:30.720]  ahead thank you for taking my call thanks for calling I'm actually calling
[02:17:30.720 --> 02:17:36.680]  today else because I you have to bear with me I'm a little nervous I I used to
[02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:41.520]  work for the federal government I worked for them for almost 13 years and I
[02:17:41.520 --> 02:17:46.080]  worked for the Department of Veterans Affairs and you know your show was
[02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:50.240]  primarily responsible for waking me up but you know I kind of knew things were
[02:17:50.240 --> 02:17:57.640]  awry when I first about three or four years before I left the VA just the way
[02:17:57.640 --> 02:18:04.120]  veterans are being treated substandard care and now I see with this
[02:18:04.120 --> 02:18:08.760]  legislation when Obama care I mean isn't that a direct contradiction to the
[02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:13.880]  health of us I mean what is your feelings on that well that's what Obama
[02:18:13.880 --> 02:18:18.280]  care really does is let them charge you more for less care and you're right
[02:18:18.280 --> 02:18:22.200]  there are laws saying you've got to take care of disabled veterans and that's
[02:18:22.200 --> 02:18:24.800]  why they're really pushing to get private charities to take care of them
[02:18:24.800 --> 02:18:28.400]  because they're planning to just get rid of it and then they know the vets and
[02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:31.200]  their families are going to probably be one of the biggest groups that's going
[02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:34.680]  to rebel when they're robbed and their contract is violated because there is
[02:18:34.680 --> 02:18:39.180]  money to take care of the veterans and it's outrageous and it just shows the
[02:18:39.180 --> 02:18:44.440]  sky's the limit if we don't get this government back in line and you know we
[02:18:44.440 --> 02:18:47.240]  criticize government all day because it's been hijacked I was gonna tell
[02:18:47.240 --> 02:18:52.200]  her to rock with the rent on time I found the most awake group is military
[02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:56.520]  government people and then police not because they're angels they're in the
[02:18:56.520 --> 02:19:00.280]  middle of it they know how corrupt it is a lot of people going to the military
[02:19:00.280 --> 02:19:02.600]  they don't agree with me and come out agreeing because they're like wow you
[02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:07.520]  weren't lying and so they're gonna take the government employees pensions as
[02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:12.560]  well that the look they've done this in other countries what do you think I mean
[02:19:12.560 --> 02:19:16.400]  I remember when I worked to be have left my job Alex I don't work there anymore
[02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:22.520]  understand I resigned because I couldn't take it I mean I'll give you for
[02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:25.800]  instance well I'll tell you what do this you've already held long enough I got to
[02:19:25.800 --> 02:19:29.400]  get a special guest on for about 10 15 minutes if you'll hold I'll come back
[02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:33.560]  and give you four or five minutes Jane to finish up with what you saw in the VA and
[02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:37.080]  I can hear the shaking in your voice that upsets you so much you have humanity
[02:19:37.080 --> 02:19:43.160]  I'm the same way I start talking about CPS court and I really shook up because
[02:19:43.160 --> 02:19:48.160]  because I couldn't help all those people and I couldn't hate I actually helped
[02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:52.720]  some of them I couldn't be around it and it really hurt me bad and also made me
[02:19:52.720 --> 02:19:56.360]  have a lot of hatred for people in the government so I had to actually quit
[02:19:56.360 --> 02:20:01.760]  helping those children so we're gonna come back and talk about it Alex Jones

[02:24:21.640 --> 02:24:34.520]  Ricardo Nieves is our guest and he is the gentleman that was in the local news
[02:24:34.520 --> 02:24:39.720]  story that we wrote a story about from fours dot com and prison planet dot com
[02:24:39.720 --> 02:24:44.120]  that got picked up by drudge report dot com yesterday pencil vanyans coerced
[02:24:44.120 --> 02:24:50.480]  into giving cheek swab at voluntary that's in quotes checkpoint and of course
[02:24:50.480 --> 02:24:53.120]  what they call voluntary becomes mandatory and we've played the local
[02:24:53.120 --> 02:25:00.240]  newscast out of georgia florida texas colorado new mexico california this is
[02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:05.160]  a every week occurrence down the last year and it's a federal program under
[02:25:05.160 --> 02:25:08.640]  the white house office of national drug control policy to quote see if you're on
[02:25:08.640 --> 02:25:12.920]  drugs and if they can intimidate they'll take blood or urine there on the side
[02:25:12.920 --> 02:25:17.080]  of the road but then they say just give us a cheek swab because they can wipe
[02:25:17.080 --> 02:25:21.160]  cells easily off the inside of your mouth so cops are sticking swabs in your
[02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:25.360]  mouth and intimidating people in the average person falls down before them
[02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:30.000]  and does this and this is to prime the pump for a national DNA database just
[02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:34.080]  like the feds 15 years ago started taking blood with rubber stamp warrants in
[02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:38.520]  Arizona now it's nationwide without warrants if they claim I think you're
[02:25:38.520 --> 02:25:43.560]  drinking I'm just gonna take the blood so Ricardo thank you so much for coming
[02:25:43.560 --> 02:25:47.760]  on with us and of course you reported it to the press so folks knew about it
[02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:53.080]  according to the Reading Eagle tell us what you said to city council well
[02:25:53.080 --> 02:25:56.400]  first off what happened to you and obviously what do you want to say about

[02:26:00.160 --> 02:26:02.960]  thousands this was done to in your area you were the one that went to city
[02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:06.760]  council you were the one that raised the alarm and more of us will now speak
[02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:10.280]  out and we are starting to reverse this but so we just commend you for not
[02:26:10.280 --> 02:26:14.520]  being a zombie sir thank you thank you Alex and thank you for having me on your
[02:26:14.520 --> 02:26:19.920]  show on Friday the 13th my sister and I were actually on our way to pick up my
[02:26:19.920 --> 02:26:24.680]  mother to take her to a doctor's appointment and as we approach the
[02:26:24.680 --> 02:26:30.600]  Warren not the Warren Street the Bingham and Street Bridge about midway on the
[02:26:30.600 --> 02:26:36.160]  bridge as we were coming near a bend we had noticed some orange cones splitting
[02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:41.880]  the lane into two I stayed in the right hand lane and I proceeded around the
[02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:48.640]  bend and as I was doing so I noticed a police vehicle with flashing lights on
[02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:57.440]  since I couldn't move over to the middle lane I kept going forward that's when I
[02:26:57.440 --> 02:27:02.200]  saw an undone as civilian person with regular clothing just step off the
[02:27:02.200 --> 02:27:09.040]  sidewalk with orange cones directed me and forcing me into a parking lot I
[02:27:09.040 --> 02:27:13.280]  couldn't go around them like I said I couldn't run them down and this is key
[02:27:13.280 --> 02:27:17.480]  this you're being commandeered you're being given a custodial arrest under
[02:27:17.480 --> 02:27:24.720]  common law you are arrested go ahead I I as I approached several feet from his
[02:27:24.720 --> 02:27:30.800]  position like you said I had to go in the direction I was being forced and
[02:27:30.800 --> 02:27:36.960]  directed to so I got into the driveway and off to the left hand side I saw an
[02:27:36.960 --> 02:27:44.560]  orange construction site but this one read paid volunteered services and as I
[02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:49.960]  entered into the parking lot I had noticed that there was an improvised
[02:27:49.960 --> 02:27:56.000]  staged parking spots with more orange cones I say total five or seven spots
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:01.760]  and within each one of these spots there were teams of people designated in each
[02:28:01.760 --> 02:28:07.040]  one of these spots with just collaborating with each other so I pulled
[02:28:07.040 --> 02:28:13.280]  into the first spot and my sister and I looked at each other and she said what
[02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:20.120]  the hell is going on and I had no idea so I noticed a woman walking to my
[02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:26.600]  vehicle naturally I rolled down my window and with that being said she told
[02:28:26.600 --> 02:28:32.080]  me I was not being cited she told me that I was not being pulled over however
[02:28:32.080 --> 02:28:35.720]  that she wanted to ask me a few questions about my driving behaviors and
[02:28:35.720 --> 02:28:42.320]  habits and take a mouse swab and that she would pay me for this naturally I
[02:28:42.320 --> 02:28:49.160]  said no thank you she came back to me and said listen I understand this is
[02:28:49.160 --> 02:28:56.480]  voluntary however and she went back into her sales pitch again you know telling
[02:28:56.480 --> 02:28:59.600]  me that she'd like to ask me about my driving you're being racketeered you're
[02:28:59.600 --> 02:29:06.640]  being pressured right so basically I again told her no thank you she said
[02:29:06.640 --> 02:29:12.600]  listen I know again this is volunteer and you know went back into her sales
[02:29:12.600 --> 02:29:17.480]  pitch once again this time she was going towards some literature she was
[02:29:17.480 --> 02:29:24.080]  carrying on her clipboard I I immediately stopped and just said listen no

[02:33:36.480 --> 02:33:42.320]  Pennsylvania headline Pennsylvania's coerced into giving cheek swab at
[02:33:42.320 --> 02:33:46.800]  voluntary checkpoint and he went and spoke out of the city council so Dan
[02:33:46.800 --> 02:33:50.160]  ended up getting picked up in the local news we picked it up nationally
[02:33:50.160 --> 02:33:55.560]  internationally and look they were sterilizing people secretly until the
[02:33:55.560 --> 02:33:58.800]  80s when it got exposed now they got caught in California again so
[02:33:58.800 --> 02:34:03.280]  governments always try to do illegal stuff this is a federal program in all
[02:34:03.280 --> 02:34:07.800]  50 states the Pacific Institute for research and evaluation was hired by
[02:34:07.800 --> 02:34:12.120]  the national highway traffic safety administration to run the checkpoint to
[02:34:12.120 --> 02:34:16.440]  look for motorists using drugs and a quiz them about their driving habits and
[02:34:16.440 --> 02:34:22.920]  so if you just joined us he's going to take a family member to the doctor and
[02:34:22.920 --> 02:34:29.160]  he's gets directed off the bridge the police force him to pull over and then
[02:34:29.160 --> 02:34:32.880]  someone comes over and starts asking him questions in most areas it's police
[02:34:32.880 --> 02:34:37.360]  doing but I want to describe exactly who this was and then they just keep
[02:34:37.360 --> 02:34:41.200]  pushing it keep it's like I won't go to Barnes and Noble hardly anymore but
[02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:44.120]  that's not like a checkpoint because they keep saying do you want the card no I
[02:34:44.120 --> 02:34:47.000]  don't are you sure you don't want the card yes I'm sure come on you know it's
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:50.040]  really good car what's wrong with you don't want the card and I'm like well
[02:34:50.040 --> 02:34:53.040]  because actually in studies it shows it isn't actually a good deal now I don't
[02:34:53.040 --> 02:34:55.760]  want to be tracked what I read and I do oh I can't believe you're giving me a
[02:34:55.760 --> 02:35:00.880]  problem sir last time I was at Barnes and Noble just last week with my son he
[02:35:00.880 --> 02:35:04.080]  wanted a couple books I said hi how you doing listen I don't want the card hope
[02:35:04.080 --> 02:35:07.160]  you're having a good Christmas and she totally ignored me a minute later goes
[02:35:07.160 --> 02:35:10.400]  what do you want the card I said listen I told you don't go through that I'm a
[02:35:10.400 --> 02:35:14.280]  human being and she was like a robot not even looking at me so it's all part of
[02:35:14.280 --> 02:35:18.240]  this mindless procedure that's how they've got cops now with like glazed eyes
[02:35:18.240 --> 02:35:23.800]  so so sir let's go back now to what happened to you Ricardo in Pennsylvania
[02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:27.440]  again break down the town you're in where it is she said to you three times I
[02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:31.320]  want you to do this you were getting up to the next time this person did it
[02:35:31.320 --> 02:35:36.720]  break it all down okay thank you Alex again city of Reading Pennsylvania
[02:35:36.720 --> 02:35:42.600]  County of Berks as you mentioned this was my third time I had told this
[02:35:42.600 --> 02:35:47.560]  unidentified woman that had no name tag did not represent who she was working
[02:35:47.560 --> 02:35:53.360]  for or herself or have any identifying information on her persons she started
[02:35:53.360 --> 02:35:57.040]  reaching for some literature this time after the third time that I politely
[02:35:57.040 --> 02:36:02.720]  told her no thank you she went to reach for it and I told her no thank you again
[02:36:02.720 --> 02:36:07.720]  she went try to go into another spiel for the fourth time and listen I just told
[02:36:07.720 --> 02:36:13.080]  her I gave her a disgusting look and with the state of my voice I just said no
[02:36:13.080 --> 02:36:21.200]  thank you she walked away and and I was I was finally free to go I rolled up the
[02:36:21.200 --> 02:36:25.880]  window my sister and I looked at each other and my sister said listen they're
[02:36:25.880 --> 02:36:29.760]  lucky they got you because you were nice and you were polite I would accustom out
[02:36:29.760 --> 02:36:34.600]  so I was yeah I just wanted to get out of there that's all I wanted to do I
[02:36:34.600 --> 02:36:37.880]  never even wanted to be there in the first play so as I'm looking for a way
[02:36:37.880 --> 02:36:42.840]  out I noticed a police officer sitting on the left-hand side of me next to the
[02:36:42.840 --> 02:36:47.920]  building some several feet away and he notices that I can't figure out the way
[02:36:47.920 --> 02:36:53.400]  to get out and he points me back out to the way that I came in so I left now I
[02:36:53.400 --> 02:36:58.720]  took my my mother to the doctor's appointment ran my sister home ran my
[02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:05.360]  mother home and this was agitating me all day so once I got home I talked to
[02:37:05.360 --> 02:37:10.360]  some trusted advisors some friends and family members and I finally called up
[02:37:10.360 --> 02:37:14.520]  the American Civil Liberties Union in which I left a voicemail message for
[02:37:14.520 --> 02:37:21.920]  them still not happy I reached out to the local media media here and a
[02:37:21.920 --> 02:37:26.360]  subsequent follow-up call came back and told me that this was the National
[02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:31.080]  Highway Traffic Safety Association and that if I wanted any more additional
[02:37:31.080 --> 02:37:34.600]  information I needed to contact the writing police department in which I
[02:37:34.600 --> 02:37:40.720]  did I spoke with an officer Smith I provided him my information and he took
[02:37:40.720 --> 02:37:46.080]  my report he told me the hold the line for a second he came back on he said if
[02:37:46.080 --> 02:37:52.640]  I will find out if this is us if we had anything to do with it because I couldn't
[02:37:52.640 --> 02:37:56.120]  identify the two vehicles the police vehicles that were clearly in the
[02:37:56.120 --> 02:38:02.480]  parking lot I never did get a follow-up call from him so not happy I reached out
[02:38:02.480 --> 02:38:06.960]  to the county because I want to know what I just went through a little bit
[02:38:06.960 --> 02:38:13.960]  later on I it came to my attention again reaffirming that it was the National
[02:38:13.960 --> 02:38:21.400]  Highway Traffic Safety Association and that a considerable amount of money was
[02:38:21.400 --> 02:38:27.240]  provided for this and that the security the police were paid for the security on
[02:38:27.240 --> 02:38:35.880]  this well that looked the fires under my feet I felt infringed upon my civil
[02:38:35.880 --> 02:38:41.680]  rights my liberties my constitutional rights from the state and all the
[02:38:41.680 --> 02:38:45.760]  statues that go along with it and I thought if this was me how many other
[02:38:45.760 --> 02:38:49.800]  people stop God stop how many other people actually didn't know their rights
[02:38:49.800 --> 02:38:54.160]  and gave up this DNA swab and by the way this is the same group that wants
[02:38:54.160 --> 02:38:58.960]  mandatory breathalyzers on all the cars who are all guilty until proven innocent
[02:38:58.960 --> 02:39:04.320]  I mean it's just beyond a police state so long story short unlike Georgia Florida
[02:39:04.320 --> 02:39:07.960]  Texas where they have cops that basically try to make you do it you got the
[02:39:07.960 --> 02:39:11.880]  lighter form but still got upset as you should they blocked the road they made
[02:39:11.880 --> 02:39:16.440]  you go do what they wanted and of Americans are so enslaved that they
[02:39:16.440 --> 02:39:20.200]  don't understand this is how real tyranny begins it's like the census is
[02:39:20.200 --> 02:39:22.920]  supposed to ask how many people live here every 10 years for congressional
[02:39:22.920 --> 02:39:27.880]  apportionment totally constitutional reasonable not what kind of toilet do
[02:39:27.880 --> 02:39:32.160]  you have do you own a gun we get this yearly business one now you know they're
[02:39:32.160 --> 02:39:36.080]  putting black boxes in the cars to track you by the mile and attacks you I mean
[02:39:36.080 --> 02:39:40.080]  this is all happening so and this is the same group pushing that so it's a long
[02:39:40.080 --> 02:39:42.480]  story short they give you the runaround finish up with what happened with that
[02:39:42.480 --> 02:39:46.440]  you go to city council where's it going from there tell us what else happened
[02:39:46.440 --> 02:39:52.720]  well I went I did go to city council like I said what lit my fires was that
[02:39:52.720 --> 02:39:57.680]  there was a considerable amount of money and they were paid for the security so
[02:39:57.680 --> 02:40:02.040]  I'm thinking okay my civil rights were just bought federal dollars bought used
[02:40:02.040 --> 02:40:08.080]  my local dollars to legally stop it illegally stopped me and with that I
[02:40:08.080 --> 02:40:13.000]  learned that I could not I had to complain supposedly to the federal level
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:17.800]  my apologies by the way if you would have blown up they might have beaten the
[02:40:17.800 --> 02:40:20.600]  daylight side of your arrest at you and I probably wouldn't have blown up but I
[02:40:20.600 --> 02:40:24.440]  got mad like what are you doing blocking the road what is this in America
[02:40:24.440 --> 02:40:27.480]  has I been through check once before and I tell the police that I go are you
[02:40:27.480 --> 02:40:31.040]  looking for a bank robber and they're like no we're just doing a safety check
[02:40:31.040 --> 02:40:34.720]  yeah a federal check of course they always know who I am in Texas they go
[02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:39.720]  come on Jones just doing our job I mean it's just there to condition people go
[02:40:39.720 --> 02:40:44.360]  ahead I didn't want to get in that satisfaction sure I know you're smart I
[02:40:44.360 --> 02:40:49.360]  took the political I took the politeness way out of it so I went up to city
[02:40:49.360 --> 02:40:58.000]  council I put out a press release and I was greeted by and a reporter there
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:02.320]  before the meeting and he had asked me if I had felt that the perception of
[02:41:02.320 --> 02:41:09.680]  police intimidated my my my rationale into perhaps giving my personal
[02:41:09.680 --> 02:41:13.360]  information or others and I said well listen if I was to walk into city
[02:41:13.360 --> 02:41:18.400]  council with seven various different attorneys behind me and one to American
[02:41:18.400 --> 02:41:22.280]  civil liberties union representative do you think city council and the
[02:41:22.280 --> 02:41:27.240]  administration would be intimidated of course they would this was nothing more
[02:41:27.240 --> 02:41:32.680]  than a gross abuse of power and in federal intrusion of my rights that
[02:41:32.680 --> 02:41:37.640]  your local tax money had to pay for yeah yeah your tax money my tax money our
[02:41:37.640 --> 02:41:45.400]  tax money yeah I I I I'm just I cannot believe that that my local officials I'm
[02:41:45.400 --> 02:41:49.600]  not sure who gave the order who authorized it but I'm disappointed I'm
[02:41:49.600 --> 02:41:54.960]  very disappointed that people or whoever enrich themselves on so many
[02:41:54.960 --> 02:42:02.080]  different levels off of their voting constituents well Mr. Nieves I know what
[02:42:02.080 --> 02:42:06.040]  happened and if you go read the article by Paul Watson and follow it over you're
[02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:09.960]  absolutely right it is a federal agency they've hired private institutes to do
[02:42:09.960 --> 02:42:14.800]  it they buy the local police either off duty but in some cases use pressure for
[02:42:14.800 --> 02:42:19.160]  highway funds to the county or city to set up these checkpoints and of course
[02:42:19.160 --> 02:42:24.640]  they have the DWI ones and all the rest of it and it's just pure TSA isation of
[02:42:24.640 --> 02:42:28.880]  the country of the world anything else you'd like to add sir today we just
[02:42:28.880 --> 02:42:33.080]  appreciate your testimony and the fact that you're speaking out against it yeah
[02:42:33.080 --> 02:42:36.960]  I I will share with you what I shared with council which I think is very
[02:42:36.960 --> 02:42:43.400]  fundamental in me my pursuing this when people are manipulated excuse me when
[02:42:43.400 --> 02:42:47.720]  people are manipulated it's anti-democratic and what's being done
[02:42:47.720 --> 02:42:52.320]  here is being controlling people people don't want to be controlled people want
[02:42:52.320 --> 02:42:56.600]  to make their own decisions because consciousness and the freedom to think
[02:42:56.600 --> 02:43:02.440]  is a fundamental human right the idea of free will being violated is something
[02:43:02.440 --> 02:43:07.720]  that even God doesn't do yet man thinks he can do this to us
[02:43:07.720 --> 02:43:12.600]  Wow you need to start a radio show and fight back because we need to articulate
[02:43:12.600 --> 02:43:17.440]  patriots like you sir to not just speak at the city council but to really get on

[02:43:29.880 --> 02:43:33.840]  important well there he goes standing up for all of our rights and this is all
[02:43:33.840 --> 02:43:36.880]  part of this creeping tyranny and political correctness and training us
[02:43:36.880 --> 02:43:41.160]  here's an ABC news story Jennifer Lawrence it should be illegal to call
[02:43:41.160 --> 02:43:46.920]  somebody fat that's the hate loss oh you say Santa Claus is white you're you

[02:43:57.400 --> 02:44:04.040]  things that aren't our rights imaginary rights exaggerated slights instead of the
[02:44:04.040 --> 02:44:09.440]  real frontal assault on all our freedoms now Jane held over she worked for I
[02:44:09.440 --> 02:44:14.240]  think she said 13 14 years for the VA veterans affairs it's in the news today
[02:44:14.240 --> 02:44:20.480]  they're gonna cut massively the the funding for disabled veterans and they
[02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:25.040]  already get I don't whenever I talk about VA care there's some good people in
[02:44:25.040 --> 02:44:28.120]  the VA but the way the government treats it with the money most of it goes for PR
[02:44:28.120 --> 02:44:31.400]  I've had all the big veterans affairs groups that fight for this on over the
[02:44:31.400 --> 02:44:36.800]  years we shall be back on when I talk about folks in Missouri and New York and
[02:44:36.800 --> 02:44:43.600]  Virginia dying from flies eating their brains I'm not kidding when all vets
[02:44:43.600 --> 02:44:49.360]  that are in the VA have you know problems like dementia whatever they strap
[02:44:49.360 --> 02:44:53.120]  you down they don't take care of you don't change your bed they lock you in
[02:44:53.120 --> 02:44:58.200]  there and then the flies go up your nose and you look this up and lay eggs in
[02:44:58.200 --> 02:45:03.560]  them in the sinus and then eat their brain a term the VA internally began
[02:45:03.560 --> 02:45:08.040]  calling maggotting I don't know if our guest knows about that but if you just
[02:45:08.040 --> 02:45:14.680]  tuned in you think I'm joking search engine maggots kill veterans in VA or
[02:45:14.680 --> 02:45:19.680]  flies kill veterans that I'm not kidding they had cases where roaches are
[02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:23.000]  eating people because roaches can actually start eating on you by the by the
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:27.760]  hundreds and of course they're hiring a bunch of foreign or doctors in many cases
[02:45:27.760 --> 02:45:33.040]  that aren't even really certified doctors when you go in there's like swatting
[02:45:33.040 --> 02:45:36.240]  guys everywhere bossing everywhere around they try to give you drugs not
[02:45:36.240 --> 02:45:42.880]  surgeries you need it's truly hellish and Weldon instance of Air Force veteran
[02:45:42.880 --> 02:45:45.960]  he goes into the VA works here in our office he just says they're incredibly
[02:45:45.960 --> 02:45:48.840]  rude to him now didn't used to be like that he just got of the Air Force eight
[02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:53.200]  years ago so it's it's it's a new world order world not a man's world not a
[02:45:53.200 --> 02:45:57.480]  Patriots world it's a tyrants world right now and she sounded upset she said
[02:45:57.480 --> 02:46:00.760]  that's terrible I had to quit I couldn't do it I don't know what she's gonna tell
[02:46:00.760 --> 02:46:09.400]  us but you know they run from bad to worse is the issue and they hate our
[02:46:09.400 --> 02:46:13.400]  veterans and they've always abused our veterans I mean they stole after World
[02:46:13.400 --> 02:46:16.560]  War one the bonuses they were supposed to get they never paid them and when the
[02:46:16.560 --> 02:46:20.320]  veterans protested they killed a bunch of them shot them and rode open with
[02:46:20.320 --> 02:46:24.400]  horses and so the government's been a stinking group of crooks for a long time
[02:46:24.400 --> 02:46:29.080]  and the cowards in the government really hate veterans because they're people
[02:46:29.080 --> 02:46:33.360]  that'll actually stand up and fight and then they take the other veterans that
[02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:35.840]  are typecasts and we'll do what they think and put them in the big city
[02:46:35.840 --> 02:46:40.640]  police departments and then say we're the Taliban basically so it's a mix of
[02:46:40.640 --> 02:46:45.200]  things but our veterans are treated like absolute toilet paper by the
[02:46:45.200 --> 02:46:49.000]  establishment Jane you've got the floor thanks for holding tell us what you were
[02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.760]  gonna say cuz you it was hard for you to even talk about it what do you want to
[02:46:51.760 --> 02:46:57.080]  tell people about the VA I mean Alex it was you know the employees that work
[02:46:57.080 --> 02:47:04.920]  there you know when I'm sure they'll vote for this they call it the VA way and
[02:47:04.920 --> 02:47:12.160]  what I mean by the VA way is once you've been kind of embedded in the system
[02:47:12.160 --> 02:47:16.280]  after you've worked there for a few years you know you kind of see it
[02:47:16.280 --> 02:47:22.880]  materializing in front of your eyes you know I was kind of a nonconformist if
[02:47:22.880 --> 02:47:29.280]  you will I never really fit into a category I always sought out jobs or I
[02:47:29.280 --> 02:47:34.960]  could work independently from the from the hospital because I couldn't deal
[02:47:34.960 --> 02:47:44.320]  with what was happening in the the institution itself you know it was it
[02:47:44.320 --> 02:47:52.040]  was just hotening it was heartbreaking you know veterans I'll give you an
[02:47:52.040 --> 02:47:57.240]  example this is kind of jumping ahead a little bit I actually worked on a I
[02:47:57.240 --> 02:48:03.200]  took minutes for a meeting for the suicide rounds committee and they had a
[02:48:03.200 --> 02:48:08.440]  mandate that they were supposed to meet to prevent veterans from killing
[02:48:08.440 --> 02:48:13.200]  themselves now you can go online you can look it up it says 22 veterans I take
[02:48:13.200 --> 02:48:18.520]  a day committing suicide something for that effect well it was just as bad five
[02:48:18.520 --> 02:48:24.960]  years ago and I was filming phone calls and I was an admin I was filming for my
[02:48:24.960 --> 02:48:30.800]  girls you know if they went to lunch or something but I pick up the phone and it
[02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:35.400]  be a veteran I worked in mental health and say I'm gonna kill myself what do I
[02:48:35.400 --> 02:48:40.800]  do you know and I had no training and even though I'd worked in the health
[02:48:40.800 --> 02:48:47.920]  care field most of my life I was like oh my god you know because I didn't know if
[02:48:47.920 --> 02:48:54.880]  the next thing I was gonna hear was a gunshot round it was that scared and when
[02:48:54.880 --> 02:49:00.080]  they finally got around to implementing suicide prevention it was almost a year
[02:49:00.080 --> 02:49:04.840]  after the fact I mean a lot of veterans don't know when you go to the patient
[02:49:04.840 --> 02:49:12.000]  advocate at your VA I worked in business one but when you go to the patient
[02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:16.240]  advocate the patient advocates actually work for the director they don't work
[02:49:16.240 --> 02:49:20.480]  for the veteran they're not there to advocate for veterans they're there to
[02:49:20.480 --> 02:49:25.960]  kind of run middle ground for the director a veteran can't go to a patient
[02:49:25.960 --> 02:49:29.640]  advocate and say my doctor is abusing me because they'll shut it down
[02:49:29.640 --> 02:49:35.320]  immediately it will get nowhere and you will get nowhere and then they'll turn
[02:49:35.320 --> 02:49:39.200]  around and they'll punish the veteran what do you think's gonna happen now as
[02:49:39.200 --> 02:49:44.120]  they cut the treatment and money for disabled veterans that have arms and
[02:49:44.120 --> 02:49:47.360]  legs blown off what do you think's gonna happen maybe we'll have public
[02:49:47.360 --> 02:49:51.640]  execution of veterans as terrorists or I mean what's the answer here just kill
[02:49:51.640 --> 02:49:55.880]  all the veterans maybe that'll make Obama happy what do we do my husband is
[02:49:55.880 --> 02:50:02.560]  a veteran Alex and you know when I'm so slowly seeing his you know entitlements I
[02:50:02.560 --> 02:50:06.400]  guess if you will being taken away they're not entitlements you know they
[02:50:06.400 --> 02:50:09.520]  call it entitlements when somebody's never worked it in their life once a
[02:50:09.520 --> 02:50:14.080]  bunch of free stuff when you sign a contract to be taken care of if you're
[02:50:14.080 --> 02:50:18.320]  wounded or hurt that's not an entitlement that is because that's
[02:50:18.320 --> 02:50:21.600]  associated with welfare because they're now calling it entitlements for even
[02:50:21.600 --> 02:50:26.320]  wounded veterans to get health care or their pension that is a contract that
[02:50:26.320 --> 02:50:31.720]  is an agreement that is a business deal and it is fraud to not pay it go ahead
[02:50:31.720 --> 02:50:36.200]  well they're a breach of contract completely that's it man I'm out of
[02:50:36.200 --> 02:50:40.320]  time God bless you and just have a great Christmas coming up man it's
[02:50:40.320 --> 02:50:43.000]  depressing hearing that type of stuff but we got to talk about it because we
[02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:49.440]  ignored it with what makes it worse Gus you're up next then Debbie Rob and

[02:54:52.680 --> 02:54:59.320]  before dawn seven mile hike I got out there at 5 30 in the morning and a
[02:54:59.320 --> 02:55:03.800]  little seven mile hike out in the hill country outside Austin and I was by
[02:55:03.800 --> 02:55:07.880]  myself and just shot a reflective video while I was out there and it's up on
[02:55:07.880 --> 02:55:11.000]  info wars calm we'll put that on screen for TV viewers they can see where it's
[02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:16.520]  at as the featured video it's escape the New World Order Titanic is what that
[02:55:16.520 --> 02:55:22.360]  video posted on info wars calm and prison planet calm is named and I think it
[02:55:22.360 --> 02:55:26.720]  makes some really good points in 10 minutes okay and then the nightly news
[02:55:26.720 --> 02:55:30.240]  is coming up tonight seven o'clock central and I think it's what Leanne
[02:55:30.240 --> 02:55:33.880]  McAdoo hosting tonight we're gonna have some breaking Intel there as well okay
[02:55:33.880 --> 02:55:39.680]  Gus is a former inmate is what he says that Gus thanks for holding and calling
[02:55:39.680 --> 02:55:47.400]  you're on the air hey Alex it's an honor I'd like to say I am a gringo of
[02:55:47.400 --> 02:55:54.840]  Hispanic descent white and black Native American descent which makes me a racist
[02:55:54.840 --> 02:55:59.080]  and a terrorist according to the that's right and if you want human unity and
[02:55:59.080 --> 02:56:04.640]  freedom you're racist that's exactly right I you know I had to laugh when I
[02:56:04.640 --> 02:56:09.400]  read this story earlier today on info wars about the NFS feeding the DEA and
[02:56:09.400 --> 02:56:13.960]  how they make fake cases in order to prosecute others you know in the federal
[02:56:13.960 --> 02:56:20.680]  system there's two rules there's the rule 35 B which is a court rule and then
[02:56:20.680 --> 02:56:25.600]  there's the sentencing guideline 5k 1.1 and both of those do the same thing
[02:56:25.600 --> 02:56:31.240]  once pre sentencing once full sentencing anybody who supplies information and the
[02:56:31.240 --> 02:56:36.840]  aid and prosecution of others can get a time cut and when I was in detention
[02:56:36.840 --> 02:56:43.320]  pending the resolution of my case I was at FDC Miami and I did seven years with
[02:56:43.320 --> 02:56:49.400]  the feds and I saw guys in their selling cases they'd establish weed houses
[02:56:49.400 --> 02:56:54.720]  grow houses and have people take care of them and then get them busted and then
[02:56:54.720 --> 02:56:57.640]  oh no that's how it all works the government runs almost all the drugs
[02:56:57.640 --> 02:57:02.760]  for the big global mafia on records it was congressional hearings at 97 CIA
[02:57:02.760 --> 02:57:07.600]  inspector general and the and again it's in mainstream news that they
[02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:13.320]  manufacture most cases and their total fraud or they frame people because they
[02:57:13.320 --> 02:57:18.200]  like innocent people as demonic scum they enjoy that and I don't think the
[02:57:18.200 --> 02:57:21.600]  average person you people always said oh everybody's innocent in prison well now
[02:57:21.600 --> 02:57:25.760]  with DNA it shows about half the people are completely innocent I mean that the
[02:57:25.760 --> 02:57:31.200]  system is evil go ahead well yeah no it's absolutely evil and you know back
[02:57:31.200 --> 02:57:38.160]  in 2008 I'd say when I was in there they started requiring us to give our DNA
[02:57:38.160 --> 02:57:42.600]  and if you ever want to know what's coming for the rest of society all we
[02:57:42.600 --> 02:57:46.920]  got to federal inmate because they do it to us first they started forcibly taking
[02:57:46.920 --> 02:57:52.520]  our DNA around 2008 and if you want to know what Obamacare is like ask a
[02:57:52.520 --> 02:57:57.840]  federal inmate because in the feds we had an ongoing joke no matter what was
[02:57:57.840 --> 02:58:01.480]  wrong with you they would fix it one or two ways they would either pull your
[02:58:01.480 --> 02:58:07.480]  tooth or give you a prostate exam that's how they fixed everything that's
[02:58:07.480 --> 02:58:11.920]  right and that's what dr. Blalock said in England it's like that Watson for a
[02:58:11.920 --> 02:58:14.400]  month couldn't get into see a doctor because they just wouldn't give him a
[02:58:14.400 --> 02:58:20.800]  pack with some aspirin in it and a wipey and just go on and die and the average
[02:58:20.800 --> 02:58:26.080]  person has no idea the hell that's awaiting them very good points yeah no
[02:58:26.080 --> 02:58:29.720]  that's what they do that they will give you a cane if you're going blind or a
[02:58:29.720 --> 02:58:33.800]  cane if you have bad knees in Cuba and they'll give you a prostate exam because
[02:58:33.800 --> 02:58:37.520]  they like to do that or they'll pull a tooth or give you pain killers that's
[02:58:37.520 --> 02:58:41.400]  it or a firing squad with men of black uniforms raping your wife in front of
[02:58:41.400 --> 02:58:45.240]  them and stopping your guts out right in front of you with giant armored

[03:00:20.600 --> 03:00:23.960]  Jones Alex Jones I dispense with the pleasantries I want to go to Debbie
[03:00:23.960 --> 03:00:27.880]  talking about mystery illness State Health Department I don't know what she's
[03:00:27.880 --> 03:00:32.760]  gonna bring up but I know people are dying everywhere from a weird bacterial
[03:00:32.760 --> 03:00:37.760]  pneumonia that also has microblasms and viruses associated which has bio weapons
[03:00:37.760 --> 03:00:41.560]  spelled all over it once a triple threat I've had family that's died people that
[03:00:41.560 --> 03:00:46.760]  are almost died sicknesses please pray for my uncle William Hammond folks because
[03:00:46.760 --> 03:00:51.880]  he's as strong as a horse and he was at a whole nine yards but it killed his son
[03:00:51.880 --> 03:00:55.640]  a few weeks ago went to his funeral and my uncle's been in the hospital now for
[03:00:55.640 --> 03:01:01.800]  weeks sedated on oxygen and it's really tearing up my family we're gonna talk to
[03:01:01.800 --> 03:01:06.680]  her in a minute here's the two-minute report of a boil down of the interview
[03:01:06.680 --> 03:01:10.120]  with C. Bell Edmonds the NSA whistleblower last night on what's currently
[03:01:10.120 --> 03:01:14.080]  happening and we'll go to Debbie only one percent of these documents have been
[03:01:14.080 --> 03:01:18.560]  released the argument that we are being given by people like Greenwald is that
[03:01:18.560 --> 03:01:24.040]  oh this is much more effective however as they are saying I am providing the
[03:01:24.040 --> 03:01:28.960]  public with this line which is a baloney line the same Greenwald is making
[03:01:28.960 --> 03:01:33.280]  multi-million dollar book deals with mainstream publishers who would never
[03:01:33.280 --> 03:01:38.560]  ever publish anything that is against establishments with documents that they
[03:01:38.560 --> 03:01:43.120]  consider to be stolen and highly classified promises the publishers that
[03:01:43.120 --> 03:01:47.280]  he's going to withhold some information some of these documents which are not
[03:01:47.280 --> 03:01:51.920]  his these are the ones that belong to the government the United States people
[03:01:51.920 --> 03:01:57.360]  to Snowden who obtained this so he has a second hand documents I will reserve
[03:01:57.360 --> 03:02:01.560]  some of these documents and I will publish this for you so you got to give
[03:02:01.560 --> 03:02:06.320]  me more million dollars rather than those guys in Guardian and gave me many
[03:02:06.320 --> 03:02:12.320]  thousands of documents and he very carefully vetted each one to make
[03:02:12.320 --> 03:02:16.240]  certain that the only ones he was giving me were ones that were in the public
[03:02:16.240 --> 03:02:21.400]  interest to know but also ones that were relevant that reveal things that the
[03:02:21.400 --> 03:02:25.360]  public doesn't know that he thought the public should know he's saying no the
[03:02:25.360 --> 03:02:29.560]  full reports up on info wars dot com and of course prison planet dot TV and I
[03:02:29.560 --> 03:02:34.120]  think we should investigate Snowden and Greenwald but but my gut tells me
[03:02:34.120 --> 03:02:37.760]  they're for real I have some questions about the way it's being handled the
[03:02:37.760 --> 03:02:40.960]  media is grabbing on to it now because they don't have a choice and I don't
[03:02:40.960 --> 03:02:44.360]  blame them only releasing certain documents because if they release others
[03:02:44.360 --> 03:02:47.960]  that actually hurt people it was illegal to gather it but if you release it it
[03:02:47.960 --> 03:02:51.640]  could hurt somebody then that'll make the cause look bad now I'm not
[03:02:51.640 --> 03:02:56.200]  criticizing Kurt and C. Bell Edmonds and and David Knight who were
[03:02:56.200 --> 03:03:00.920]  investigating it but I don't think I mean they're talking about a resting
[03:03:00.920 --> 03:03:04.640]  Greenwald there they're there they're already criminally going after the
[03:03:04.640 --> 03:03:09.680]  Guardian and it doesn't matter this has really hurt the system so I think we
[03:03:09.680 --> 03:03:12.920]  should be ready to win instead of just always you know automatically thinking
[03:03:12.920 --> 03:03:16.760]  something stage now I'm not saying that people are wrong to question this I'm
[03:03:16.760 --> 03:03:21.480]  just saying I don't see the evidence there and I don't and I see what C. Bell
[03:03:21.480 --> 03:03:25.280]  saying and she's a real whistleblower who was gagged in things but that was a
[03:03:25.280 --> 03:03:30.280]  long time ago things are changing now let's go to Debbie in Texas what what's
[03:03:30.280 --> 03:03:34.120]  the mystery illness you're talking about with the state health department yeah
[03:03:34.120 --> 03:03:39.320]  they've got out of Conroe there's eight people that went into one hospital four
[03:03:39.320 --> 03:03:45.040]  of them are dead they said two of them were fighting for their life they have
[03:03:45.040 --> 03:03:48.400]  looked into it they've said doing tests and they said that they're testing
[03:03:48.400 --> 03:03:51.560]  negative for standard strains of flu all right let me stop you I'm gonna have to
[03:03:51.560 --> 03:03:55.760]  go into overdrive with you ma'am can you hold on the next segment sure let me
[03:03:55.760 --> 03:03:59.320]  just question you're saying you're with the state health department no no no
[03:03:59.320 --> 03:04:03.720]  I'm not with the state health you're saying you talk to them no this is
[03:04:03.720 --> 03:04:08.240]  coming out of KHHOU out of Houston I got it they're reporting on it
[03:04:08.240 --> 03:04:13.800]  guys KHOU mystery illness because I've told people weeks ago this killed
[03:04:13.800 --> 03:04:18.360]  Rob do's friend in New Jersey 34 years old it killed my cousin Peter Hammond
[03:04:18.360 --> 03:04:22.160]  it's really hurt my uncle who's been fighting for his life for two weeks
[03:04:22.160 --> 03:04:26.760]  William Hammond and my dad's been sick for a month and they can't find anything
[03:04:26.760 --> 03:04:31.680]  it looks like a microplasm and yeah there it is patients ranging from ages
[03:04:31.680 --> 03:04:35.920]  41 to 68 were admitted and that's just a hospital that recognizes this is some
[03:04:35.920 --> 03:04:39.720]  kind of mystery thing because again they cannot find out what it is they think
[03:04:39.720 --> 03:04:43.560]  it's a microplasm so I'm gonna come back to you ma'am and let you make your

[03:08:06.560 --> 03:08:11.200]  because there's a war on for your mind
[03:08:11.200 --> 03:08:21.920]  you know someone who died of the mystery illness I've been talking about this for
[03:08:21.920 --> 03:08:25.960]  more than two weeks on air about two and a half weeks ago my cousin very sweet
[03:08:25.960 --> 03:08:32.440]  person good friend of mine Peter Hammond died got sick one day died the next
[03:08:32.440 --> 03:08:37.560]  not being able to breathe then his father my uncle who was taking care of
[03:08:37.560 --> 03:08:42.160]  my mother's brother has now been sick for I guess that was three weeks ago when
[03:08:42.160 --> 03:08:46.080]  Peter got sick for three weeks and has been in the hospital for over a week so
[03:08:46.080 --> 03:08:49.920]  bad they had to sedate him and basically put him on oxygen with assisted
[03:08:49.920 --> 03:08:53.960]  breathing and he's gotten a little bit better but it's my mother and father
[03:08:53.960 --> 03:09:01.080]  there right now and it is just serious situation and because I really love my
[03:09:01.080 --> 03:09:03.520]  uncle you know he's one of the people that helped wake me up to the New World
[03:09:03.520 --> 03:09:08.960]  Order he's actually called in on the show of the years William Hammond and
[03:09:08.960 --> 03:09:14.960]  just pray for him out in the east Texas he's in a good hospital in the Tyler but
[03:09:14.960 --> 03:09:20.720]  the issue is I called it a mystery illness because I had swabs done on my
[03:09:20.720 --> 03:09:26.920]  children who were been sick for weeks because of vitamins and minerals and
[03:09:26.920 --> 03:09:29.600]  stuff they just it just the fever never goes away they're going around doing
[03:09:29.600 --> 03:09:33.360]  stuff they're whatever they just have a low fever and cough my dad's been sick
[03:09:33.360 --> 03:09:38.560]  for a month almost a month my wife's been sick for three weeks I have not
[03:09:38.560 --> 03:09:42.240]  gotten it by the grace of God and I chopped chocolate up to the beyond
[03:09:42.240 --> 03:09:46.720]  taking tangerine in the iodine and the rest of it literally because I mean I
[03:09:46.720 --> 03:09:49.400]  don't ever get sick anymore I don't get allergies anymore I used to be racked by
[03:09:49.400 --> 03:09:52.320]  him I just by the grace of God I'm more healthy I drink more water too that's
[03:09:52.320 --> 03:09:58.720]  part of it but they tested him two and a half weeks ago the first time he was
[03:09:58.720 --> 03:10:04.120]  the hospital he didn't go to hospital for about a week after his son died and
[03:10:04.120 --> 03:10:08.800]  they just nothing came back it's not flu it's not bacteria it's not and I was
[03:10:08.800 --> 03:10:14.480]  saying look for microplasms and they're like oh wow and then now they are
[03:10:14.480 --> 03:10:17.800]  finding some type of weird microplasm I've got the literature at home in some
[03:10:17.800 --> 03:10:23.160]  people but not in my uncle and it's really weird because they say his lungs
[03:10:23.160 --> 03:10:26.640]  look like he's been smoking five packs of cigarettes his whole life he's never
[03:10:26.640 --> 03:10:30.440]  been a smoker he was always an athlete and was in athletics well I guess
[03:10:30.440 --> 03:10:36.360]  football and track at LSU in the Vietnam veteran a helicopter pilot with
[03:10:36.360 --> 03:10:43.000]  special forces delivering special forces shot down six times he never told
[03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:46.080]  anybody about it me and my cousin dug into his trunk his army trunk one time
[03:10:46.080 --> 03:10:50.680]  just unbelievable black ops all over Vietnam and other countries over there
[03:10:50.680 --> 03:10:54.440]  just a really great guy with a shirt off in shorts he looks like he's in better
[03:10:54.440 --> 03:11:01.760]  shape than I am he's a strong guy and the reason we know look flu they say
[03:11:01.760 --> 03:11:05.600]  kills 35,000 people a year but that's usually infirm people and it's really
[03:11:05.600 --> 03:11:10.040]  about 10,000 the medical numbers show out of 300 million that's not that many
[03:11:10.040 --> 03:11:13.960]  but it is a problem this is killing healthy people people that are like
[03:11:13.960 --> 03:11:21.040]  oxes young people children and there's no media coverage of it there's no
[03:11:21.040 --> 03:11:26.600]  coverage until now KHOU 11 we're putting it up on infowars.com this just
[03:11:26.600 --> 03:11:30.480]  came out last night the lady just called in Debbie we're gonna go back to her in
[03:11:30.480 --> 03:11:34.840]  a minute my uncle believed it was chemtrails because you know he was also
[03:11:34.840 --> 03:11:38.600]  a regular pilot stuff and did all sorts of piloting down in Latin America and
[03:11:38.600 --> 03:11:42.260]  things and he's pointed out the lower chemtrails were coming in actually
[03:11:42.260 --> 03:11:46.320]  coming in and dissipating on the ground the investigation the mysterious
[03:11:46.320 --> 03:11:49.800]  illness in Montgomery County is expanding to other hospitals as doctors
[03:11:49.800 --> 03:11:55.080]  report similar cases the new cases files are being reviewed for similarity for
[03:11:55.080 --> 03:11:58.520]  eight of the Conra regional medical centers that prompted a Montgomery
[03:11:58.520 --> 03:12:02.920]  County Health Department investigation see somebody finally has a brain at that
[03:12:02.920 --> 03:12:06.800]  health department I mean they'll take one SARS case the necklaces in the
[03:12:06.800 --> 03:12:09.760]  world folks have international freakouts this is something they can't
[03:12:09.760 --> 03:12:16.200]  identify killing people and not just people I know Rob News friend one of his
[03:12:16.200 --> 03:12:22.680]  best friends went to sleep woke up dead overnight pneumonia four of those eight
[03:12:22.680 --> 03:12:26.200]  patients died and two are still fighting for their lives at one hospital eight
[03:12:26.200 --> 03:12:32.280]  people come in and four of them died two were fighting for their lives my
[03:12:32.280 --> 03:12:36.240]  uncle's fight for his life right now another hospital in east Texas we don't
[03:12:36.240 --> 03:12:40.120]  currently have a diagnosis for what we call this illness they can't discover
[03:12:40.120 --> 03:12:43.560]  it folks they take the cultures they send them off they can't find out what
[03:12:43.560 --> 03:12:53.120]  it is and again they can't find out what it is so they're just calling it flu to
[03:12:53.120 --> 03:12:57.000]  push the vaccine and folks it came out and studies five years ago that that
[03:12:57.000 --> 03:13:00.680]  flu vaccine was actually spreading it you can look that up and the more
[03:13:00.680 --> 03:13:04.680]  vaccines we take the sicker we get and then it gives it to other people and
[03:13:04.680 --> 03:13:10.080]  incubates in them mysterious rip story illness strikes seven Alabama two dead
[03:13:10.080 --> 03:13:16.480]  oh we just found another one oh they never find out what it is folks that's
[03:13:16.480 --> 03:13:21.240]  as they don't want anybody to know this stuff's all sent off to the CDC Debbie
[03:13:21.240 --> 03:13:25.320]  what do you think's going on here she goes again if it was even something that
[03:13:25.320 --> 03:13:28.320]  wasn't that big of a deal they'd be fear mongering it they're not fear mongering
[03:13:28.320 --> 03:13:32.040]  it this is the same government the sudden lethal biological releases in New
[03:13:32.040 --> 03:13:35.280]  York before in the subway they don't want us to know I mean this is something
[03:13:35.280 --> 03:13:40.040]  special go ahead yeah that's what I was thinking as a fact I sense nobody's
[03:13:40.040 --> 03:13:45.080]  saying anything about this wine flu we had they created such a panic over it oh
[03:13:45.080 --> 03:13:48.920]  yeah you'd have some diabetic with both their legs cut off totally sick die of
[03:13:48.920 --> 03:13:52.360]  it and they put them all over the news you got healthy people dying and they're
[03:13:52.360 --> 03:13:57.800]  not talking about it exactly and since it was just simply out of Conroe which I'm
[03:13:57.800 --> 03:14:04.560]  15 miles from Conroe it's shocked me I mean it's everywhere it's all over the
[03:14:04.560 --> 03:14:08.080]  country when I talk about this the emails flood in the people are dying all
[03:14:08.080 --> 03:14:12.880]  over the place yeah man it's really sad because people are gonna have to start
[03:14:12.880 --> 03:14:17.480]  looking into I mean if something won't say anything about it it makes you
[03:14:17.480 --> 03:14:23.080]  wonder why why are they not getting the CDC why the CDC not saying anything what
[03:14:23.080 --> 03:14:27.680]  is it and how do you protect yourself from it that's the biggest thing I mean
[03:14:27.680 --> 03:14:31.840]  is it airborne is it not is it my contacts how is it well yeah I mean they
[03:14:31.840 --> 03:14:38.160]  can identify anything whether it's h19e or whether it's a bird flu this or that
[03:14:38.160 --> 03:14:41.480]  there's another one mother says mystery illness transport son into dying
[03:14:41.480 --> 03:14:46.600]  patient in days same deal respiratory actually it's in local news but not
[03:14:46.600 --> 03:14:51.640]  national news showing there's a blackout folks if two people die in China of some
[03:14:51.640 --> 03:14:56.600]  weird new viral thing it's all over the news well something's going on there
[03:14:56.600 --> 03:15:01.360]  just needs to be investigated like tomorrow I'm gonna open the phones up in
[03:15:01.360 --> 03:15:04.640]  first hour or two for people to talk about this we're gonna get to the bottom
[03:15:04.640 --> 03:15:07.840]  of this I should have been on this my gut told me it's something really nasty
[03:15:07.840 --> 03:15:12.160]  thank you so much Debbie let's go to Ryan and main Ryan have you heard about
[03:15:12.160 --> 03:15:17.080]  people dying in your area no not exactly quite like that but I did have an
[03:15:17.080 --> 03:15:20.640]  interesting topic to talk about Caldmore Gellens not sure if you've heard
[03:15:20.640 --> 03:15:23.960]  about it yeah I mean there are a lot of weird skin disorders and things going
[03:15:23.960 --> 03:15:27.040]  on there's also schizophrenics to think you know there's other stuff going on but
[03:15:27.040 --> 03:15:31.360]  I think there's they've had medical doctors in Oklahoma confirm in surgeries
[03:15:31.360 --> 03:15:37.120]  that there is some type of weird nanotech bacterium growing in people yeah
[03:15:37.120 --> 03:15:40.160]  they just turn them away they don't know what it is so they just give them a
[03:15:40.160 --> 03:15:45.720]  little aspirin pack and say have a nice day basically and thank God most of the
[03:15:45.720 --> 03:15:49.720]  stuff hasn't been happening around here in Maine Maine's actually pretty quiet as
[03:15:49.720 --> 03:15:55.000]  far as the NSA checkpoints and highway checkpoints and things like that well
[03:15:55.000 --> 03:15:59.440]  there's a headline Utah mom says healthy son 19 year old son died from flu
[03:15:59.440 --> 03:16:04.280]  shot four years ago CBC reported you take the H1N1 shot it doubles your
[03:16:04.280 --> 03:16:10.520]  chances of getting the regular flu you take the H1N1 shot study H1N1 shot
[03:16:10.520 --> 03:16:15.880]  doubles chances of flu anybody can search that and see that I mean it's just
[03:16:15.880 --> 03:16:23.520]  amazing God bless you I appreciate your call let's talk to Nakia I said I go to
[03:16:23.520 --> 03:16:28.960]  Nakia children services to kids it's a service to take your kids it's a service
[03:16:28.960 --> 03:16:32.800]  to take your DNA it's a service to take babies blood at birth and lie about it
[03:16:32.800 --> 03:16:37.880]  for 30 years and get caught okay so go ahead and tell us what happened on
[03:16:37.880 --> 03:16:47.160]  Nakia well it's kind of a really strange story my husband and I have been
[03:16:47.160 --> 03:16:52.960]  married for three years but we'd neither one of us have kids together well my son
[03:16:52.960 --> 03:17:00.360]  has been being raised by my husband and they decided that in the state of Alaska
[03:17:00.360 --> 03:17:06.000]  thinking your child is completely legal well my son told his father that he had
[03:17:06.000 --> 03:17:10.280]  gotten his bank in from his stepdad yeah no no it's illegal everywhere it's
[03:17:10.280 --> 03:17:16.840]  illegal to hurt them bodily meaning actually hurting an organ and but they
[03:17:16.840 --> 03:17:19.920]  lie just like guns are legal they'll take you to jail for having a legal gun
[03:17:19.920 --> 03:17:26.040]  but but so what happened well they decided to take my son and my two-step
[03:17:26.040 --> 03:17:31.920]  funds into protective services charge me with neglect because I work a full-time
[03:17:31.920 --> 03:17:36.520]  job oh yeah we're supposed to be in jail sure so that's how it works kids think
[03:17:36.520 --> 03:17:41.560]  it's fun to go tattle and then nowadays they get disappeared to a dungeon and so
[03:17:41.560 --> 03:17:45.200]  I hope everybody's happy for calling the state see how that turned out I'm really
[03:17:45.200 --> 03:17:49.760]  sorry to hear that happen to you so where's it going now well I'm fighting
[03:17:49.760 --> 03:17:55.040]  the state as hard as I possibly can my son is currently living with his father
[03:17:55.040 --> 03:18:01.280]  who is known to the state as a heroin addict well I'm gonna tell you it's
[03:18:01.280 --> 03:18:03.920]  better to be with a heroin addict see they don't care they want to break up a
[03:18:03.920 --> 03:18:06.560]  family they look at the best family want to break it up it's better to be there
[03:18:06.560 --> 03:18:09.000]  in the state and this is what I would do everybody better get together for the
[03:18:09.000 --> 03:18:12.520]  kids and decide to not do this with each other because it's bad enough to have
[03:18:12.520 --> 03:18:15.440]  one parent taken from the other what's really bad if the state will end up
[03:18:15.440 --> 03:18:19.480]  taking them period I'm out of time God bless you ma'am nine times out of the
[03:18:19.480 --> 03:18:24.600]  folks you before you call the state on somebody they better be getting beat
[03:18:24.600 --> 03:18:29.960]  with a tire iron and I'm gonna go further here when they got real babies and
[03:18:29.960 --> 03:18:33.600]  crack houses I've seen this literally over a hundred times over the last 18
[03:18:33.600 --> 03:18:37.200]  years on air reading the news they'll have babies black white doesn't matter
[03:18:37.200 --> 03:18:42.600]  and if they're in a real crack house in a in a crib in dirty diapers with flies
[03:18:42.600 --> 03:18:47.560]  all over them a five-year-old you know weighing 15 pounds in some cases
[03:18:47.560 --> 03:18:52.800]  concentration camp victims they might get one piece of chicken a week the CPS
[03:18:52.800 --> 03:18:57.440]  will go look at a child in a vat of feces and will not take them because they
[03:18:57.440 --> 03:19:01.400]  don't want to they've already been soft killed they're not gonna be adopted out
[03:19:01.400 --> 03:19:04.960]  they're not gonna get money putting them on drugs they let them die because
[03:19:04.960 --> 03:19:08.080]  they're really a eugenics death camp the health departments on average that's
[03:19:08.080 --> 03:19:10.360]  what they were set up for a hundred years ago that mean everybody that works
[03:19:10.360 --> 03:19:13.600]  there's bad but that's the main mission and they will leave the children there
[03:19:13.600 --> 03:19:18.300]  if your child's healthy and beautiful and smart and has black hair and green
[03:19:18.300 --> 03:19:21.520]  eyes they will send in commandos to kidnap your kids they can get a half
[03:19:21.520 --> 03:19:24.960]  mil two mil three mil for your kid if they're blonde-haired blue I only get
[03:19:24.960 --> 03:19:29.920]  three hundred four in a cell for them so now the minority kids that aren't as
[03:19:29.920 --> 03:19:34.640]  big as demand they still want them to put them on drugs in the foster care system
[03:19:34.640 --> 03:19:37.880]  and call them special needs they can get hundreds of thousands a year torturing
[03:19:37.880 --> 03:19:42.040]  them so don't everybody gets you know black children mainly used for
[03:19:42.040 --> 03:19:45.840]  medical experiments the state takes them for medical experiments that's their
[03:19:45.840 --> 03:19:49.360]  favorite thing is killing black children slowly with pesticides and other
[03:19:49.360 --> 03:19:52.160]  things and I know I'm racist for being against it you look that up actually I'm
[03:19:52.160 --> 03:19:56.160]  not kidding not just age drugs actual pesticide and nobody got in trouble in
[03:19:56.160 --> 03:19:58.880]  New York fact they got little eight-year-old kids right now there they
[03:19:58.880 --> 03:20:04.880]  torture real good
