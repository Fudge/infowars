[00:00.000 --> 00:26.800]  The Trump Justice Department that abandons the rule of law to give sweetheart deals to
[00:26.800 --> 00:33.840]  criminals who commit their crimes on behalf of Donald Trump. And yes, Roger Stone, I'm looking at you.
[00:36.160 --> 00:40.480]  That's Elizabeth Warren, failing and bitter in New Hampshire. And like so many on the left,
[00:40.480 --> 00:47.200]  howling for Roger Stone to die in prison. A 67-year-old man with no criminal record caught up
[00:47.200 --> 00:54.000]  in the Russia hoax, farce, caught up in an investigation that proved to be fruitless.
[00:54.000 --> 01:00.880]  He's looking at nine years behind bars. You know what the average rapist does in this country?
[01:00.880 --> 01:06.000]  We checked today. Four years. You know what the average armed robber gets? Three years. The average
[01:06.000 --> 01:11.920]  thug who violently assaults somebody less than a year and a half. But the left, CNN as well,
[01:11.920 --> 01:19.280]  demanding that Roger Stone die in prison. This man needs a pardon. This is a pure political hit.
[01:19.280 --> 01:24.560]  Roger Stone is facing prison because he is a high-profile Donald Trump supporter. It's that
[01:24.560 --> 01:29.760]  simple. You want proof? Here it is. John Brennan and James Clapper will sleep at home tonight.
[01:29.760 --> 01:35.520]  Both have been caught lying under oath on camera about matters of national importance. And yet
[01:35.520 --> 01:42.000]  neither's in jail. Neither's been indicted. Neither ever will be. The Stone case, by contrast,
[01:42.000 --> 01:47.600]  was transparently political from day one. The lead prosecutor, Andrew Weissman, is now literally
[01:47.600 --> 01:53.520]  an MSNBC contributor. The judge in the case, Amy Berman Jackson, is an out-of-control Democratic
[01:53.520 --> 01:58.800]  partisan who purely out of spite stripped Roger Stone of his First Amendment rights and prevented
[01:58.800 --> 02:03.840]  him from making a living. Coming on this show, for example, speaking at all in public. Now Stone
[02:03.840 --> 02:09.600]  and his wife, who is 71 years old and deaf, have lost their home because of this. They have no
[02:09.600 --> 02:16.480]  insurance. They're utterly broke. The whole thing is shocking and it's disgusting. It's a farce that
[02:16.480 --> 02:21.760]  discredits the entire American justice system. The president seems to understand that. Can not
[02:21.760 --> 02:27.040]  allow this miscarriage of justice, he tweeted recently. He's right. On a couple of levels.
[02:27.040 --> 02:31.280]  What's happening to Roger Stone is totally wrong. It's immoral and we should not allow it in this
[02:31.280 --> 02:36.800]  country. But politically, it has significance too. Stone's prosecution was designed in part to
[02:36.800 --> 02:42.720]  confirm the fantasies that Democrats have constructed to explain the outcome of the 2016 election.
[02:42.720 --> 02:48.480]  His conviction helps their case. In other words, if the Russia collusion story was a hoax, and of
[02:48.480 --> 02:53.520]  course it most certainly was a hoax, then why is Roger Stone going to prison for his role in it?
[02:54.560 --> 03:00.560]  If Roger Stone serves even a single day behind bars, the Russia lie will be validated as true.
[03:01.440 --> 03:06.960]  Stone's imprisonment will be prima facie evidence in the view of Democrats. So at this point,
[03:06.960 --> 03:12.560]  there's really only one solution. The president must pardon Roger Stone or commute his sentence,
[03:12.560 --> 03:17.440]  before he goes to jail. Democrats will howl if he does that. Well, they're howling anyway.
[03:17.440 --> 03:21.680]  They howl every day. Chuck Schumer is now yelping about yet another investigation
[03:21.680 --> 03:28.640]  into Roger Stone. Russia gate two. In one entirely constitutional act, the president could save
[03:28.640 --> 03:36.720]  Roger Stone's life, vindicate himself and end this nonsense forever. Don't act so surprised,
[03:36.720 --> 03:43.920]  globalist. You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you? Join Bandat video,
[03:43.920 --> 03:49.920]  and I will complete your training. Together, we can overthrow the emperor and restore the republic.
[03:55.200 --> 03:58.640]  We brought in a non-globalist paid actor and did a blind taste test between the mac and cheese
[03:58.640 --> 04:03.200]  from storable foods at infowarstore.com and one of America's leading brands. These are the results.
[04:03.200 --> 04:09.760]  Now go ahead and try the first macaroni and cheese to your right. It literally smells like nothing.
[04:15.600 --> 04:16.640]  What are your first thoughts?
[04:19.600 --> 04:24.240]  Typical. It takes back to when the babysitter doesn't quite know how to make it like your mom
[04:24.240 --> 04:29.920]  makes it, so it's just not. Let's move on to the one on your left.
[04:29.920 --> 04:35.520]  What? See, this one actually smells like cheese. All right, don't have any on my 4K.
[04:50.880 --> 04:54.800]  Go buy your storable food at infowarstore.com.

[05:58.320 --> 06:12.640]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[06:12.640 --> 06:34.320]  It's episode six, Return of the Republic. Here we are broadcasting worldwide on this Thursday,
[06:34.320 --> 06:41.600]  February 13th, 2020 global transmission. And to say the wheels have come off the
[06:41.600 --> 06:47.840]  deep state's criminal operations is an understatement. We are living in incredibly spectacular times.
[06:50.240 --> 06:55.520]  The attempt to put Roger Stone wrongfully in prison was supposed to be a cherry on top of the
[06:55.520 --> 07:02.800]  Trump impeachment and removal for the original Russia Gate hoax that failed. So the New York Times,
[07:02.800 --> 07:07.920]  a few months ago when he was wrongfully convicted by the admitted kangaroo court of Democrat party
[07:07.920 --> 07:13.200]  operatives and bragged publicly that they were going to lynching during the trial and after.
[07:14.240 --> 07:20.880]  Well, now it's a cherry on top showing what a giant fraud they are and is causing massive
[07:20.880 --> 07:26.640]  outrage across not just the U.S. but the world. No one is buying this miscarriage of justice.
[07:26.640 --> 07:34.640]  And I predict that within two weeks, Roger Stone will be back co-hosting this broadcast and the
[07:34.640 --> 07:41.680]  war room. And the silencing of this American patriot who was punished for helping advise President
[07:41.680 --> 07:47.280]  Trump, getting President Trump to want to run for office, making President Trump believe he could
[07:47.280 --> 07:55.040]  win. President Trump would not be President if it wasn't for Roger Stone. He wouldn't be President
[07:55.040 --> 08:00.240]  if it wasn't for Matt Drudge. He wouldn't be President if it wasn't for WikiLeaks.
[08:00.240 --> 08:09.520]  And if the president doesn't pardon Stone, he's insane. Word is, though, as I told you back on
[08:09.520 --> 08:16.160]  Friday and as I said on Monday and Tuesday and yesterday on Wednesday, Trump is currently
[08:16.880 --> 08:25.280]  preparing to pardon Roger Stone. And CNN and MSNBC are up there spinning going,
[08:25.280 --> 08:30.400]  he can't do that. That's obstruction of justice. No, that's why you have an executive branch that's
[08:30.400 --> 08:36.240]  co-equal to the legislative and the judicial so that when those get out of control, it could be a
[08:36.240 --> 08:42.960]  check on the other. And vice versa. It's called separation of powers and it's part of our federal
[08:42.960 --> 08:47.840]  system. When you think about federal system, it's not a worship of the federal government.
[08:47.840 --> 08:51.840]  The federalist system actually divides power between the states and the federal government
[08:51.840 --> 08:57.520]  and then divides the state, local and federal government into three parts each between the
[08:57.520 --> 09:05.520]  three as well. So it's divided six different ways so that you don't get a man on a white horse,
[09:07.040 --> 09:15.600]  a.k.a. Napoleon Bonaparte or Adolf Hitler. Everything was done to restrain the hands of
[09:15.600 --> 09:23.600]  tyrants. And so it is a very, very exciting time, ladies and gentlemen, to be alive,
[09:24.160 --> 09:31.760]  but make no mistake. The deep state is going to strike back and this coronavirus is already
[09:31.760 --> 09:39.360]  hurting the global economy and I expect to see it continue to do so. And that's one of the Achilles
[09:39.360 --> 09:45.600]  heel that are out there that could derail some of this exploding nationalist patriot movement.
[09:46.400 --> 09:47.760]  The other thing that could happen is
[09:51.280 --> 09:55.600]  those of us that have ignited the populist movement worldwide,
[09:58.000 --> 10:06.960]  we have to understand that we have to hold our populist leaders and ourselves to task
[10:06.960 --> 10:12.880]  and make sure that these hard-earned gains continue on and that the larger challenges we
[10:12.880 --> 10:18.240]  face of the big tech surveillance grid and the authoritarianism of communist China is dealt with.
[10:19.120 --> 10:24.960]  Now, I do want to go to phone calls starting in the next segment to talk about the economy,
[10:24.960 --> 10:31.600]  to talk about the coronavirus, to talk about Roger Stone and the whole Russiagate hoax imploding.
[10:31.600 --> 10:39.920]  And the fact that Tucker Carlson is absolutely right. Trump must pardon Stone because Stone is
[10:39.920 --> 10:46.000]  innocent and Stone was well-roaded and the jurors, it turned out, were high-level democratic party
[10:46.000 --> 10:51.120]  operatives who were bragging about how they were going to send him to prison for the rest of his
[10:51.120 --> 10:59.920]  life and this judge is another dangerous tyrant and all of them need to be roundly repudiated
[10:59.920 --> 11:07.120]  and this judge needs to be removed from the bench for judicial misconduct if there ever was.
[11:08.480 --> 11:13.680]  Remember just a few months ago, the Washington Post headline, U.S. prosecutors call for Alex
[11:13.680 --> 11:23.760]  Jones's arrest for outing a juror's identity under dozens of Supreme Court rulings and other
[11:23.760 --> 11:30.960]  federal rulings. It is not just your right but your duty to show conflicts of interest in jurors
[11:30.960 --> 11:40.720]  and jurors are public in everything but very rare mafia trials. But that shows who the left is.
[11:40.720 --> 11:44.800]  They want to arrest everyone. So I'm going to tell the left and the authoritarians,
[11:44.800 --> 11:53.680]  you're dangerous. America in the world is waking up to you and you can piss up a rope.
[11:55.520 --> 11:58.800]  I am protected by the Bill of Rights and Constitution. I am protected by those that
[11:58.800 --> 12:03.680]  fought and died to defend that Bill of Rights and Constitution that doesn't give me rights but
[12:03.680 --> 12:10.560]  simply points out that the government's job is to defend those rights, not take a wrecking ball
[12:10.560 --> 12:21.760]  to it like this Judge Jackson and others have done. It's incredible. Roger Stone,
[12:21.760 --> 12:29.600]  Trial Juror was former dim candidate who hated Trump. Well yeah, I mean one of them was the
[12:31.440 --> 12:37.280]  wife of a Mueller probe lawyer who ran the Russiagate operation. That person had to step down.
[12:37.280 --> 12:43.920]  The judge openly said, no, no, you need to stay on when Stone's people raised an issue
[12:43.920 --> 12:51.200]  and then the judge told the media, you don't say her name. Piss up a rope Judge Jackson.
[12:53.680 --> 12:59.120]  You monster. Think about North Korea is its power is only inside North Korea.
[13:01.520 --> 13:06.560]  Same thing with you lady. Your illegitimate out of control power grab only goes to
[13:06.560 --> 13:13.280]  only goes as far as we put up with. You are a sniveling witch who will burn in hell.
[13:15.360 --> 13:24.080]  You're another arrogant, vicious, aggressive judicial tyrant and you are the bane of free
[13:24.080 --> 13:32.480]  nations. You are a curse on free peoples. You are not an American. You are an authoritarian dirtbag
[13:32.480 --> 13:44.160]  witch. Now try that on for size you pig face monster. Americans need to stop bowing down
[13:44.160 --> 13:54.640]  to people that are dishonorable. The left has whipped themselves up into a piranha like frenzy
[13:54.640 --> 14:02.800]  to run around and assault and attack and shoot people and drive cars into us and sue everybody
[14:02.800 --> 14:10.320]  and bear false witness and say all these honorable judges like cabiners or rapists with no proof.
[14:11.120 --> 14:21.520]  It's disgusting and people are sick and tired of it and they see through your crap and this
[14:21.520 --> 14:25.680]  isn't the type of awakening where it just kind of we wake up for a while and it goes away. It's
[14:25.680 --> 14:32.000]  going to get more intense. It's going to get deeper. It's going to absolutely explode and
[14:32.640 --> 14:37.440]  it's going to be a rocky road folks but I'm here to tell you humanity is up to the challenge with
[14:37.440 --> 14:43.120]  God's help all the things we face and this is the beginning of the end of these technocrats
[14:43.120 --> 14:48.000]  and the things they're involved in but it is important to stand up to these monsters.
[14:48.000 --> 14:54.320]  So I predict that Roger Stone will be on this show this broadcast within two weeks.
[14:54.960 --> 14:59.440]  The Senate is next week on the 20th and we're going to have reporters there
[15:00.080 --> 15:04.080]  covering and reporters at CPAC. Hell this is so important as a good chance I'm going to go.
[15:05.200 --> 15:12.000]  You know CPAC so cowardly the Republican blue bloods that still control it that people like
[15:12.000 --> 15:17.680]  Roger Stone aren't even welcome there or people like myself that actually got Trump elected.
[15:17.680 --> 15:21.680]  That shows you what Trump's up against though. It doesn't matter if I show up at CPAC we'll
[15:21.680 --> 15:24.880]  just totally steal the show and take the whole thing over but you know what I don't I don't
[15:24.880 --> 15:31.280]  need to do that so I just may not do it but I'm really thinking about it. I'm really thinking

[21:09.360 --> 21:18.720]  hate and they lie to us and they turn us against each other and everything they do is about dishonor
[21:18.720 --> 21:26.240]  and about disruption and about devolving the society and ruins in their own admissions
[21:27.520 --> 21:32.880]  and so when president trump pardons roger stone he's not just showing he has the power
[21:32.880 --> 21:38.640]  and repudiating their lives he's showing he's not scared of them when they say you're a criminal
[21:38.640 --> 21:47.840]  because you let this person out of jail and trump is turning the corner of absolutely not
[21:47.840 --> 21:53.360]  caring what these criminals say or do because he has right action he's following the villa
[21:53.360 --> 22:00.000]  rights and constitution he is the president and his only failing is he's not gone after these people
[22:00.000 --> 22:06.880]  strong enough but if the action we've seen the last four days and the acceleration of the action
[22:07.760 --> 22:14.960]  continues it's going to be devastating within just seven days to two weeks
[22:14.960 --> 22:17.680]  just like watch a dragster
[22:20.000 --> 22:26.960]  and the light flashes green and they hit that accelerator and just all the sudden boom it's
[22:26.960 --> 22:33.040]  down the road we're in that first half second right now and i mean the dragster is finally just
[22:34.560 --> 22:41.040]  i'm like yeah you smell the fuel fire shooting out the sides i mean wow looks like a good run
[22:41.040 --> 22:50.240]  but sometimes the dragster goes off to an angle and blows up so this is dangerous
[22:50.240 --> 22:54.320]  situation and you know what they say in pulp fiction what the wolf says let's not start
[22:54.320 --> 23:04.000]  celebrating just quite yet but the left had their giant con game their confidence act
[23:04.000 --> 23:08.080]  their arrogance and the crimes they've been committing and the things they've been doing
[23:08.080 --> 23:13.360]  have just been staggering that they got away with them but did they get away with them
[23:14.000 --> 23:21.360]  in the court of public opinion i have a lot of family that are yellow dog democrat types
[23:22.960 --> 23:25.200]  mainly republicans in my family but there's democrats
[23:27.680 --> 23:33.600]  none of them are democrats now they all hate the democratic party and so the democratic party is dead
[23:33.600 --> 23:39.360]  and that they are completely through with it forever and they say this openly in front of
[23:39.360 --> 23:51.280]  their other liberal friends who then agree the democratic party is done if we want it to be
[23:51.280 --> 24:03.920]  and it's emblematic that biden and polosi and other creatures like maxine waters and diane
[24:03.920 --> 24:13.360]  feinstein look and behave like a dead spider you find in the corner behind the door in the spring
[24:13.360 --> 24:22.320]  that froze to death they're dead spiders politically and they're a joke and their followers are a
[24:22.320 --> 24:29.840]  joke but then how are they getting elected election fraud the democrats want a admitted
[24:30.480 --> 24:36.480]  communist who never got a paycheck till he was 40 from a college
[24:36.480 --> 24:45.920]  who got married and had a honeymoon in the old soviet union and reportedly visited gulags and
[24:45.920 --> 24:56.160]  thinks they're great and who swindles i mean he didn't just personally steal five million from
[24:56.160 --> 25:01.120]  that university his wife took over and bankrupted into four years he hired over 50 people in his
[25:01.120 --> 25:06.960]  family and they all swindled some estimates are over 30 million dollars out of it in in four years
[25:07.680 --> 25:13.200]  i mean you want somebody to bankrupt this country you want somebody to suck your ass dry
[25:13.200 --> 25:18.560]  he will do it if you give him a problem he'll line you up and have your ass shot because he's
[25:18.560 --> 25:23.040]  by these standards the anointed king that we've all got about down through
[25:23.040 --> 25:30.640]  who and the buffoons that that that that follow him and the millennials with their
[25:30.640 --> 25:33.440]  thousand dollar smartphones their two hundred dollar skinny jeans
[25:36.400 --> 25:42.400]  half of them in major polls identify as communist that's a clear and present danger
[25:43.440 --> 25:49.520]  and so we need to stop kissing their asses and stop bowing to all their political correctness
[25:49.520 --> 25:55.200]  and stop trying to show that we're we're hip and we're woke and we're down with them because
[25:55.760 --> 26:00.400]  if you do that this country's done we need leadership in their face
[26:04.320 --> 26:08.560]  and to let these people know what losers and jokes they are not in a mean way
[26:09.360 --> 26:14.320]  but the way to say hey jack you're not as cool as you think you are with all that student debt
[26:14.320 --> 26:22.480]  and spouting all your communist crap you know i see videos every day like the one i'm about to play
[26:23.600 --> 26:27.680]  and i don't play them on air because after i've already watched them once
[26:27.680 --> 26:33.680]  i'm kind of a selfish person i don't want to see it again so this video i'm about to play
[26:33.680 --> 26:38.000]  is emblematic of hundreds i've seen hundreds i know you've seen
[26:38.000 --> 26:46.400]  of universities all over in missouri and in ohio it's not just in california new york and places
[26:47.840 --> 26:56.080]  where you'll have a little white 18 year old freshman 19 year old wearing a run dmc retro shirt
[26:56.080 --> 27:01.840]  or something and weird trendy black girls walk over tallies girls and start punching them in the
[27:01.840 --> 27:08.240]  face everybody laughs and agrees they're white they deserve to be attacked
[27:09.600 --> 27:17.120]  but think about what the democrats have become that they're self-segregating everywhere
[27:17.120 --> 27:22.880]  and saying whites are inherently bad that's hit larry and race science but just turn the other way
[27:23.600 --> 27:27.280]  and then there's this idea well white people have done bad things so you deserve it
[27:27.280 --> 27:32.880]  really some other white dude did something 200 years ago so i'm bad if my father committed
[27:32.880 --> 27:43.440]  crimes and went to prison i'm not to blame the idea of blood libel blood blood debt that because
[27:43.440 --> 27:49.440]  somebody somewhere someplace did something that looks a little like you you're guilty that's not
[27:49.440 --> 27:54.880]  just tyranny that's mental illness and that's crazy but when we come back i'm gonna play uva
[27:54.880 --> 28:00.320]  says multicultural student center is open to all races after too many white people rant
[28:00.320 --> 28:07.840]  goes viral and when you see this this is what the standard is this isn't some aberrant thing
[28:07.840 --> 28:12.720]  that only happens here or there this is what's taught at evergreen college and all over the place
[28:12.720 --> 28:18.080]  where they just say no whites are allowed this weekend and a professor goes that's really racist
[28:18.080 --> 28:26.640]  they get fired this is the standard that's going on because they're breaking people down to say
[28:26.640 --> 28:30.960]  fine i'm evil because i'm white politically tell me what i'm supposed to do and the answer is
[28:30.960 --> 28:36.800]  literally kiss my boots but the black woman up there saying all of this she's just the puppet
[28:36.800 --> 28:44.240]  spouting the playbook to create massive racism she's being told oh you're doing this to make people
[28:44.240 --> 28:48.320]  realize how bad they are because they're white no they're doing this the wiki league says it because
[28:48.320 --> 28:53.840]  they want everyone hating each other and divided long race just like a prison the democrats know
[28:53.840 --> 29:01.760]  what they're doing and it's sick if you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs listen to
[29:01.760 --> 29:07.520]  me you don't know me and we'll never meet i had a problem like you once i drank and used to party
[29:07.520 --> 29:13.840]  a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life i realized i needed
[29:13.840 --> 29:19.920]  help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me if you've tried to fix your drinking and drug
[29:19.920 --> 29:25.920]  problem and you know you can't do it alone you need to call the national treatment advisors
[29:25.920 --> 29:31.680]  they'll immerse you into a 30 day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally
[29:31.680 --> 29:38.080]  change your life and if you have ppo private health insurance the entire program may be covered
[29:38.080 --> 29:46.480]  fix your problem right now before it gets any worse get clean call now and learn more 800 506
[29:46.480 --> 29:56.800]  6740 800 506 6740 that's 800 506 6740
[30:00.320 --> 30:04.720]  all right folks here's the bad news we've already sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle with the
[30:04.720 --> 30:09.920]  patented nano tech silver that's documented to knock out viruses and bacteria unlike anything else
[30:10.480 --> 30:15.920]  but we do still have it in the three ounce and the one ounce for limited time the good news is
[30:15.920 --> 30:22.240]  we have the super blue toothpaste and the super silver toothpaste both that have the nano silver
[30:22.240 --> 30:28.160]  in them as well the super blue has tea tree that's also antiviral and antibacterial and high quality
[30:28.160 --> 30:33.200]  iodine and then of course the whitening has the nano silver but on top of that it has the above
[30:33.200 --> 30:38.160]  sea coral calcium that remelanorizes the teeth and so it's just the best toothpaste you're gonna
[30:38.160 --> 30:43.360]  find period it has the nano silver and we still have supplies of it though it'll sell out at
[30:43.360 --> 30:49.360]  current rates in about two weeks but despite that i'm keeping it at sale at 50% off so everybody
[30:49.360 --> 30:53.200]  can protect themselves with this high quality product you've never used it before get yours
[30:53.200 --> 31:01.360]  today infowarstore.com infowarstore.com i've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers
[31:01.360 --> 31:08.720]  who enforce your support and your help in rebooting americana is a challenge to the globalist system
[31:08.720 --> 31:13.760]  of corporate tyranny has really caught hold not just here in the u.s but worldwide and
[31:13.760 --> 31:19.760]  president trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting americana and basic liberty is amazing
[31:19.760 --> 31:25.840]  as well he's still lacking on the big tech censorship taking action against that in some other areas
[31:25.840 --> 31:30.960]  but trying to end the wars boosting our economy speaking out against communist china trump's been
[31:30.960 --> 31:37.280]  doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that we're being targeted
[31:37.280 --> 31:43.680]  because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a
[31:43.680 --> 31:48.800]  big way and so we're gonna see some major fireworks out of them but it's critical to not let ourselves
[31:48.800 --> 31:54.720]  get down when we see all the poison they spray at us that's an attempt to demoralize us we've
[31:54.720 --> 32:01.200]  got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy well it's finally happening the president is
[32:01.200 --> 32:06.560]  coming out and saying the deep state are a bunch of out of control criminals that need to be prosecuted
[32:06.560 --> 32:14.720]  and he has fired over 200 senior bureaucrats in the state department and the justice department
[32:14.720 --> 32:20.880]  in just the last few days and he took the head prosecutor over stone and offered her a job at
[32:20.880 --> 32:26.800]  treasury as soon as she quit that job he then withdrew the nomination and now she's out on her
[32:26.800 --> 32:33.120]  globalist ass this is beautiful it's happening but we need to see a lot more all the neocons need
[32:33.120 --> 32:39.360]  to be fired all the obama appointees fired all the deep state globalists who have resumes with
[32:39.360 --> 32:47.600]  george soros fired fired fired fired trump is finally unleashed trump is not the red wave he is the
[32:47.600 --> 32:54.640]  red storm an info wars is the tip of the spear powered by we the people never backing down
[32:54.640 --> 33:18.480]  never giving in and delivering victory in our time you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:24.960 --> 33:31.360]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live broadcasting worldwide i'm about to go to your phone calls
[33:31.360 --> 33:36.160]  first time callers of the first round we're taking eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three
[33:36.160 --> 33:43.280]  nine famous constitutional lawyer famous criminal lawyer norm patis is going to be in studio next
[33:43.280 --> 33:49.440]  hour taking your legal questions and comments on roger stone and just the state of the deep state
[33:49.440 --> 34:00.880]  and so much more now getting back to not letting the left intimidate us and dictate to us
[34:03.200 --> 34:10.080]  the left pushes a religious style ideology that the west is inherently bad and the west inherently
[34:10.080 --> 34:16.960]  must go away and that white people are inherently bad and i see the reports every day just like you
[34:16.960 --> 34:23.120]  do out of europe out of sweden out of germany where men will gang rape a seven-year-old girl
[34:24.080 --> 34:31.120]  beat her up and the judge lets them go and they go oh that's just islam or someone hang grenade
[34:31.120 --> 34:38.160]  attacks a fire department for no reason doesn't even get in trouble sometimes they i saw a story
[34:38.160 --> 34:47.920]  yesterday where two somali migrants went on a spree robbing stabbing attackings for days
[34:49.680 --> 34:56.480]  and the judge has said you can go free it's a religious virtue signal sacrament and you said
[34:56.480 --> 35:01.920]  to yourself why are they doing that it's a plan to bring down the civilization
[35:01.920 --> 35:13.200]  and so we have to stop being politically correct in any way i personally do not hate homosexuals
[35:14.400 --> 35:20.000]  but i am not going to use the word gay anymore because that's how it all started oh just use
[35:20.000 --> 35:28.320]  the word gay don't hurt people's feelings don't you heterosexual it's a scientific term
[35:28.320 --> 35:37.280]  and then once you use the word gay which just means happy in a good mood now you see well
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.520]  they're telling people all over the united states in europe don't say the word mother or father
[35:41.520 --> 35:46.800]  don't have the word woman uh or man on the side of a bus because somebody might not identify as a
[35:46.800 --> 35:52.000]  man or a woman now those are dirty words these people are thought police that want control and
[35:52.000 --> 35:58.400]  it's all run by the tapestock institute in mi6 and left us the cia and that's all declassified
[36:01.280 --> 36:06.640]  by the 50s the ford foundation had taken over the cia and they was declassified in the 70s
[36:06.640 --> 36:11.600]  that they said we want ugly art ugly literature we want to attack the family because there's no
[36:11.600 --> 36:16.400]  way our system will come in because the american system's too good everyone's going to want to
[36:16.400 --> 36:23.440]  adopt this we have to make architecture and culture ugly and have hollywood spew anti-american
[36:23.440 --> 36:31.200]  stuff or everybody's going to want this freedom think i'm joking just type in cia paid for ugly
[36:31.200 --> 36:42.720]  art and ugly architecture think about how evil that is of course the left can't compete with
[36:42.720 --> 36:50.480]  Marilyn Monroe and 57 shabbies with food lines in russia but what does bernie sanders say
[36:51.280 --> 36:57.680]  you pull the video up he says there's too many types of deodorant there's too many different
[36:57.680 --> 37:04.800]  types of meat there's too many different types of clothing that that's why there's a problem with
[37:04.800 --> 37:12.400]  the economy that is the most perfect inversion of reality i've ever heard you can say people that
[37:12.400 --> 37:18.000]  worship consumerism and worship goods are bad because they are but having goods makes you
[37:18.000 --> 37:24.400]  secure to take care of your family you wouldn't sell out for the goods but nice cars clothes that
[37:24.400 --> 37:30.960]  fit well good medicine good schooling a motorboat going to play golf that's that's the fruits of
[37:30.960 --> 37:38.080]  freedom that's not a bad thing but he says there's inequality because we've got 30 different types
[37:38.080 --> 37:47.920]  of deodorant excuse me that's a manifestation of how much damn freedom we've got we don't need 23
[37:47.920 --> 38:00.080]  choices of deodorant 18 choices of sneakers when kids are going hungry he wants you to get one
[38:00.080 --> 38:08.560]  pair of shoes a year that you stand in line for from him because he's in charge of that
[38:08.720 --> 38:15.200]  and they use these stupid mathematical equations to the millennials going there are over 500
[38:15.200 --> 38:24.720]  billionaires one of them has more money than 100 million americans jeff bezos we need to take his money
[38:24.720 --> 38:31.440]  meanwhile jeff bezos funds all the leftist groups teaching that jeff bezos isn't worth 160
[38:31.440 --> 38:38.640]  billion dollars his inflated stock is he couldn't spend five percent of that on real goods it would
[38:38.640 --> 38:43.440]  plunge his stock the minute if jeff bezos took five percent of his stock out and sold it his
[38:43.440 --> 38:49.600]  company would collapse it's fiat it's not real money and sanders sits there and tells people
[38:49.600 --> 38:56.720]  here's an example this company's valued at 200 million dollars by smu and all he's been in the
[38:56.720 --> 39:04.000]  news there's not there's not two million dollars in cash around here what these cameras all this
[39:04.000 --> 39:13.840]  well what does that even mean it's bs i'm not worth 200 million dollars they say i am bs bs bs bs bs
[39:13.840 --> 39:21.920]  yes i don't have two million dollars in cash and by the way bernie sanders would say give me that
[39:21.920 --> 39:29.120]  money i need that money to buy more product and pay my employees see see how well there's too much
[39:29.120 --> 39:34.480]  deodorant and and and you'd think that would come out of somebody with a 70 iq with wearing a
[39:34.480 --> 39:41.120]  football helmet but it doesn't it comes out of this piece of crap and so he's got bozo clown hair
[39:41.120 --> 39:49.040]  like einstein oh you've got bozo hair let me bow down to you right now what new bs is going to
[39:49.040 --> 39:54.160]  flow out of your mouth please please tell me right now what new loads of crap are about to come out
[39:54.160 --> 40:02.400]  of your mouth it takes capitalism and investment to build things and to have employees and to
[40:02.400 --> 40:09.360]  build infrastructure that's why capitalism works you go to any communist or socialist tv
[40:09.360 --> 40:14.480]  radio studio there's nothing there and there's all this big grant money coming in but no one knows
[40:14.480 --> 40:21.040]  where it goes because the people on top keep it on but you come into a free market facility
[40:21.040 --> 40:26.880]  there's equipment and people driving nice cars who have insurance because that's how capitalism works
[40:27.760 --> 40:35.600]  it builds up everybody that actually wants to work but i'm gonna stop right there i said i take
[40:35.600 --> 40:40.720]  your phone calls we're gonna go to break them right back to them and i said i'd play these clips
[40:40.720 --> 40:44.640]  but you notice i haven't played them because it's so disgusting and it's so sickening to watch it
[40:46.880 --> 40:55.600]  you have this authoritarian monster woman who's saying the script of we need white people to leave
[40:55.600 --> 41:05.840]  the new diversity offices set up well that's territorialism and look if you go to africa
[41:06.800 --> 41:10.480]  the first thing you're gonna learn is this tribalism just like it's been everywhere around the world as
[41:10.480 --> 41:17.280]  well and if you're not in the right tribe you're dead so then we take this lady and go oh you're
[41:17.280 --> 41:27.840]  the paragon of all answers she just shows up and says i'm taking over your college get the hell out
[41:28.480 --> 41:33.840]  because that's what the left has programmed her to do that's what the left is is a takeover
[41:33.840 --> 41:38.320]  and the left finally went if people won't accept communism we'll just give them racism
[41:39.440 --> 41:43.440]  instead of an ethos of we all have the bill of rights and constitution we're americans
[41:43.440 --> 41:50.160]  we're proud of that heritage we're unified in our own success together no they go we'll just give
[41:50.160 --> 41:56.480]  people race and it devolves right back to that and attacks the christian ethos that's the only
[41:56.480 --> 42:01.600]  chance we've got to not blow ourselves up in the planet the process so let's go out to break with
[42:01.600 --> 42:06.320]  university of virginia this is what's being taught there with this woman saying get out of here if
[42:06.320 --> 42:16.000]  you're white here it is public service announcement excuse me if y'all didn't know this is the msc and
[42:16.000 --> 42:20.480]  frankly there's just too many white people in here and this is a space for people of color
[42:20.480 --> 42:26.320]  so just be really cognizant of the space that you're taking up because it does make some of us pocs
[42:26.320 --> 42:30.880]  uncomfortable when we see too many white people in here it's only been open for four days and frankly
[42:30.880 --> 42:36.640]  there's the whole university for a lot of y'all to be at and there's very few spaces for us so keep
[42:36.640 --> 42:45.120]  that in mind thank you keep that in mind oh yeah yeah i imagine the kkk showed up and said hey
[42:45.120 --> 42:49.760]  company black people get the hell out of here we'd send the marines in but see oh it's a black lady
[42:49.760 --> 42:54.720]  we've got to do what she says this is all tyranny testing as he will put up with like you know get
[42:54.720 --> 43:00.800]  out of here kiss my boots you evil white devil i have confirmed with high-level sources that president
[43:00.800 --> 43:06.880]  trump is intending to either pardon roger stone after his sentencing or give him clemency saying
[43:06.880 --> 43:13.680]  the conviction stands but you now basically don't go to jail either way this is incredibly good news
[43:13.680 --> 43:18.880]  but let's not forget julian assange that's one of the biggest black marks on trump is that he
[43:18.880 --> 43:23.840]  famously said i don't know who got the emails i don't know where they came from the russians
[43:23.840 --> 43:29.120]  a fat dude in his mom's basement whoever's got him release him it's about hillary committing a crime
[43:29.120 --> 43:34.000]  not who has the emails don't change the subject well julian assange undoubtedly took trump over
[43:34.000 --> 43:39.520]  the top the wiki leaks expose the deep state the man is a hero daniel ellsberg was a hero well
[43:39.520 --> 43:44.080]  assange is even a bigger hero and he's rotting in solitary confinement and the court hearings can
[43:44.080 --> 43:49.680]  barely talk president trump do the right thing and ask the british to release julian assange
[43:49.680 --> 44:02.480]  and give him a medal there's roughly only 260 days left until the 2020 election and already you've
[44:02.480 --> 44:06.480]  seen all sorts of crazy things happen the globalists are trying to plunge the economy they're trying
[44:06.480 --> 44:10.640]  to start wars they're trying to overthrow the president they're trying to silence free speech
[44:10.640 --> 44:15.360]  they're trying to trigger riots in the streets but everything they do is blowing up in their face
[44:15.360 --> 44:20.480]  we the people have to pray stay focused be involved keep spreading the word keep countering their
[44:20.480 --> 44:26.160]  lies and we have to be prepared in case things go south that's why it's so critical to go to

[47:43.600 --> 47:50.480]  of their deeds and the and the and the total overturning of the common sense that martin
[47:50.480 --> 47:56.640]  luther king jr promoted and the absolute race baiting being taught by the left this is all
[47:56.640 --> 48:02.800]  they've got this is their rearguard action is to create racial division in this country and the
[48:02.800 --> 48:09.840]  answer is not groveling to the left when they spew their anti-white garbage but getting in their
[48:09.840 --> 48:15.840]  face that's why i support the it's okay to be white movement in fact when i went out and hung
[48:15.840 --> 48:21.280]  up posters in austin they ignored it i went out and said it's great to be white but under it it said
[48:21.280 --> 48:34.000]  it's great to be black it's great to be brown it's great to be human so i tried to hire an airplane
[48:35.280 --> 48:40.720]  to fly around there in the dnc saying it's okay to be white no one would even do it
[48:43.840 --> 48:49.360]  that's how beaten over the head we've gotten so folks just if people want to live on their knees
[48:49.360 --> 48:56.800]  let's just let's just do it right now of course it's okay to be white it's great it's great to
[48:56.800 --> 49:03.440]  be alive it's great to be human and and we should realize how sick this has gotten white liberals

[49:15.840 --> 49:23.520]  hating on the west and stop spewing bizarre race-based garbage you you i mean i will say it white
[49:23.520 --> 49:30.080]  people kind of are the problem it's white leftist pushing all of this crap and legitimizing and
[49:30.080 --> 49:34.640]  defending the black israelites when they were messing with the covington kids and we're gonna
[49:34.640 --> 49:42.400]  kill you we're gonna do this and that and the media defended it and you know the black israelites
[49:42.400 --> 49:47.680]  were just like antifo or the kkk or any other thug group because i've been around them i have
[49:47.680 --> 49:52.400]  them smart off to me and i'll just i'll bust you right upside your head and all the sudden
[49:52.400 --> 49:56.800]  they're not so tough anymore once they run into somebody that isn't going to sit there and hear
[49:56.800 --> 50:05.520]  their bs but when there's a little kids they can go mess with them all day can't they and the media
[50:05.520 --> 50:11.520]  can then gang up on them so i tell the kkk and the black israelites and mecha and la raza you're all
[50:11.520 --> 50:15.680]  a bunch of damn trash funded by the big banks to make us all hate each other and i'm sick of your
[50:15.680 --> 50:21.200]  crap and i see right through you you can go to hell you're you're you're shameful disgusting people
[50:24.480 --> 50:26.720]  but let me tell you it's more disgusting it's parents
[50:28.160 --> 50:34.320]  that pay to send their students to get obsolete degrees 90 plus percent of degrees are obsolete
[50:34.320 --> 50:38.720]  my attack on higher education it's been made obsolete by the bureaucracy and the corruption
[50:38.720 --> 50:44.800]  and you go pay all this money for it and it's worthless and all your children get is an indoctrination
[50:50.480 --> 50:52.640]  because this isn't some isolated thing
[50:54.400 --> 50:59.760]  this there's hundreds of these videos hell there's all the famous videos saying no men
[51:00.400 --> 51:05.600]  no white men you know allowed in the Missouri state or whatever out on the commons and the
[51:05.600 --> 51:10.720]  woman goes get me some muscle and it's a weird chicken neck crazy looking white woman telling
[51:10.720 --> 51:17.520]  black dudes to come stop white people from walking in the park this is bs but this is the lowest level
[51:17.520 --> 51:24.320]  of tribalism of communism of we're taking over your space we're a gang you're not allowed here
[51:26.800 --> 51:32.160]  and because we've laid down so much as the original americans for every race color and creed
[51:32.160 --> 51:38.720]  who believe in that americana ideal we have let these people run around and do this and it's our
[51:38.720 --> 51:43.280]  fault you want to know whose fault it is look in the mirror there are those that are more guilty
[51:43.280 --> 51:48.800]  as v for vendetta says and they will be dealt with but all right i'm gonna go to your phone calls

[52:07.360 --> 52:13.760]  seven eight nine alex uh i'm not going to belabor this i'm just going to tell you that we
[52:13.760 --> 52:18.320]  sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle with the nano silver that's documented to take out the
[52:18.320 --> 52:24.400]  coronavirus family of sars we had the three ounce left and the one ounce left and it will sell out
[52:25.760 --> 52:30.880]  by early next week and it funds our operations the 360 win but i used to spray on my hands with
[52:30.880 --> 52:36.720]  the dispenser in my throat um i hardly ever get sick started getting sick last week drank
[52:36.720 --> 52:43.840]  a bunch of immune gargle gone dealt with so info war store.com and we also have the super silver
[52:45.200 --> 52:49.600]  whitening and then regular super blue toothpaste that has the nano silver in it as well that's 50
[52:49.600 --> 52:54.560]  percent off during this crisis i'm not going to raise the price i'm going to leave it at 50
[52:54.560 --> 52:59.600]  percent off till it sells out got about two weeks of this left at about three weeks of the of the
[52:59.600 --> 53:04.240]  super blue and it's just it's so good for your body so good for your gums and then separately
[53:05.280 --> 53:10.560]  the government's buying up all the storable food my patriot won't sell it to him us military
[53:10.560 --> 53:16.000]  prepping for coronavirus pandemic military times virus death toll sores as china changes
[53:16.000 --> 53:21.120]  counting methods and now admits that it's just absolutely exploded that's Reuters north three
[53:21.120 --> 53:29.920]  shoots dead coronavirus patient after he's seen at public baths this is a race specific bioweapon
[53:29.920 --> 53:35.040]  it is man made that part's confirmed that's why governments are freaking out i hope it's not
[53:35.040 --> 53:41.840]  as bad as they're saying but this is mutating and it's very very serious in my view and we're
[53:41.840 --> 53:46.960]  going to call the disagrees though first that's why i raised that brian in texas give us your view
[53:46.960 --> 53:56.320]  on the coronavirus sir okay i just want to say the death to uh the the ratio of how many people
[53:56.320 --> 54:02.800]  died to how many people are diagnosed with it doesn't match cases outside of china there's
[54:02.800 --> 54:07.840]  the ones inside of china it's a purge they're purging their political dissidents they're they're
[54:07.840 --> 54:18.000]  they're the only people who have died outside of china were people who weren't in china when
[54:18.000 --> 54:23.440]  they got the disease but i don't even think it was the disease that killed them something else
[54:23.440 --> 54:28.400]  is killing them you know what i you know what i tend to agree with you this is clearly a man made
[54:28.400 --> 54:33.840]  virus i think it does kill some people but there's no doubt that they're putting some fake videos
[54:33.840 --> 54:38.400]  out in china of like a man and woman laying there to create fear they're letting everybody videotape
[54:38.400 --> 54:44.800]  to create fear and gg ping who's teetering on the edge of collapse thanks to us standing up to him
[54:44.800 --> 54:50.000]  and his trade war we under attack from them from 40 years uh that they're using this as a way to
[54:50.000 --> 54:57.120]  submit their control and have mass roundups and change the subject from taiwan and and the pro
[54:57.120 --> 55:03.920]  freedom groups winning so yeah i think you're right i think the evidence is all there there's
[55:03.920 --> 55:08.000]  been no deaths in any of the quarantines we would be seeing deaths in europe everywhere
[55:08.720 --> 55:14.080]  your united states everywhere there aren't any they're not dying of the virus that's all i know
[55:15.440 --> 55:22.880]  well definitely this has been a big god send us gg ping but i've learned something when there's
[55:22.880 --> 55:29.920]  real deaths from a corona type virus or other pneumonia virus they covered it up uh and i've
[55:29.920 --> 55:34.720]  confirmed that that that's come out in documents it's it's happened in my family so i just because
[55:34.720 --> 55:42.240]  you're not hearing about deaths i get why trump doesn't want people to know how serious this virus
[55:42.240 --> 55:48.000]  potentially could be because he knows they want to use it to hurt the economy uh but i think it's
[55:48.000 --> 55:54.560]  trumped pun intended by the public health fact that people deserve to know and i think the fact that
[55:54.560 --> 55:59.280]  his own top scientist and the fact that senator cotton and others are saying it's man made
[56:00.240 --> 56:03.280]  shows that trump knows a lot of things the general public doesn't know what do you think
[56:04.080 --> 56:09.600]  it might be but we can't trust anything china says so all we can go by is how many people
[56:09.600 --> 56:14.880]  are dying outside of china that's all i want to know who's contracted it who is spreaded outside
[56:14.880 --> 56:21.360]  of china and somebody died outside of china nobody it's not happening the ones that died
[56:21.360 --> 56:26.400]  outside of china were in china when they got it and the one in japan they haven't even confirmed
[56:26.400 --> 56:31.280]  that it was the virus that killed her she was 60 years old i hope you're right that's why we
[56:31.280 --> 56:38.720]  have brother brother you don't disagree i mean i i mean every angle is is needs to be looked at
[56:39.280 --> 56:44.000]  and clearly gg ping is using this for a power grab and to go after political dissidents the
[56:44.000 --> 56:50.320]  question is how deadly is the virus really i hope you're right but clearly the major universities
[56:50.320 --> 56:56.160]  multiple ones now say this is man made it's very obvious it's man made so shouldn't we be concerned
[56:56.160 --> 57:01.600]  about that or if it's man made what's the point of having a harmless man made virus uh and then
[57:01.600 --> 57:09.280]  why is the pentagon concerned i don't know about all that oh all i know is that all i just want to
[57:09.280 --> 57:14.320]  know who how many people are dying outside of china that's the only that is a absolutely critical point
[57:14.320 --> 57:19.840]  and we've got different official numbers we'll put that up on screen actually tv viewers all right
[57:19.840 --> 57:29.120]  thank you brian all right leo jamie james jason john bobby bill matthew we're back in t minus two
[57:29.120 --> 57:36.000]  minutes what i do know is the red storms here trump is purging the traders and he's accelerating in
[57:36.000 --> 57:41.840]  the attack and i love it and we have lived to see it and i hope it continues on man i love it
[57:43.360 --> 57:45.920]  cry have it and let loose the dogs of war
[57:49.280 --> 57:53.760]  three weeks ago we told you that the pentagon had set up secret quarantine centers for the
[57:53.760 --> 57:58.480]  coronavirus and that they believed it was much more serious than we were being told now we know
[57:58.480 --> 58:02.800]  that that is the case and we know the federal government and major corporations have been buying
[58:02.800 --> 58:07.680]  up all the major storable food supplies around the country almost everyone else is sold out
[58:07.680 --> 58:14.480]  but our supplier my patriot info or store dot com still has their entire line of high quality
[58:14.480 --> 58:19.200]  fresh food and it's fresh that's why you have to wait 10 to 14 days for to get delivered not
[58:19.200 --> 58:22.800]  because they don't have the food but because they've got to package it and their factories are going
[58:22.800 --> 58:29.600]  24 hours a day high quality fresh food the best package systems taste great protection your family

[59:03.440 --> 59:09.760]  and the justice department in just the last few days and he took the head prosecutor over stone
[59:09.760 --> 59:15.760]  and offered her a job at treasury as soon as she quit that job he then withdrew the nomination
[59:15.760 --> 59:21.120]  and now she's out on her globalist ass this is beautiful it's happening but we need to see

[1:00:25.280 --> 1:00:29.600]  to claim the president doesn't have the power to pardon roger stalin he doesn't have the power to
[1:00:30.160 --> 1:00:34.800]  say that nine years in prison it's absolutely out of control but of course he does
[1:00:37.120 --> 1:00:40.160]  they said he doesn't have the power to block people from seven islamic countries that don't
[1:00:40.160 --> 1:00:45.440]  have proper passport systems of course he he does so that's all coming up with norm paddus
[1:00:45.440 --> 1:00:50.880]  we're taking your phone calls right through the entire broadcast today let's go to leo in minnesota
[1:00:50.880 --> 1:00:57.760]  the lie of systemic racism not found even in the ghetto yeah that's that really whatever i've always
[1:00:57.760 --> 1:01:03.120]  seen is groups try to use racism to control people but at the grassroots you really just
[1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:07.120]  don't see a lot of it what do you make of that video the university of virginia telling whites
[1:01:07.120 --> 1:01:14.480]  they're not welcome i think it's ridiculous alex i mean that's that's only things you find in these
[1:01:14.480 --> 1:01:20.080]  liberal institutions in these colleges out here in the streets you just don't see it i mean i've
[1:01:20.080 --> 1:01:27.440]  lived in the ghetto in nevada florida mississippi boston and i tell you what it's just not there
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:34.560]  black white hispanic latino asian if you struggle in the ghetto everybody sees through it it's more
[1:01:34.560 --> 1:01:39.520]  of a class thing than it is a race thing exactly and the globalists are using class warfare in
[1:01:39.520 --> 1:01:46.720]  the name of racism to divide the the working class so they don't unify to broker a better deal and
[1:01:47.440 --> 1:01:53.120]  a more successful system but but you see we're gonna break through this i believe the streets
[1:01:53.680 --> 1:02:00.480]  they are conservative alex the streets in your average thug is not for gay marriage they're not
[1:02:00.480 --> 1:02:06.560]  for transgenderism they're not for drag queen story hour we just need to crack these streets
[1:02:06.560 --> 1:02:11.280]  and get to the people that are in these streets and i i truly believe that they will get behind
[1:02:11.280 --> 1:02:17.120]  trump 100 well i think it's already happened that's why the left's trying to re-energize racism is
[1:02:17.120 --> 1:02:21.440]  trump has record hispanic and black support and that's why they're freaking out because they're
[1:02:21.440 --> 1:02:28.960]  losing control of the plantations yes sir and and as far as my case i just want to thank you
[1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:34.720]  donald trump because without the survival shield x2 and without donald trump i'd still be a liberal
[1:02:34.720 --> 1:02:40.880]  left wing crazy believe in the mainstream media pop culture in hollywood you guys helped me the x2
[1:02:40.880 --> 1:02:45.280]  gave me the clarity and the focus to read between the lines and understand what's really going on
[1:02:45.280 --> 1:02:50.960]  out here so by the way that's not just high my iq that's what the studies show went way up when i
[1:02:50.960 --> 1:02:56.160]  finally got on clean iodine eight years ago and i'm not gonna get graphic but let's just say you
[1:02:56.160 --> 1:03:02.800]  know uh the uh well my wife certainly well let's just say this it's it's good to be 16 again it's
[1:03:02.800 --> 1:03:08.720]  just amazing how they hit us with the bad halogen fluoride and take away the good one yes sir and
[1:03:08.720 --> 1:03:13.120]  i've even put my two and a half year old twins and i've supplemented them with iodine and their
[1:03:13.120 --> 1:03:18.000]  motor skills and it's tremendous compared to the other kids they're around oh it's you gotta have it
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:22.800]  if you don't have iodine you die and then they're taking it out of everything so we don't have it
[1:03:22.800 --> 1:03:29.840]  we're falling apart it's amazing so so what happened when you started taking x2 well at first i felt a
[1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:36.640]  little drowsy and a little down exactly but after a few weeks i you know i got a lot of energy you
[1:03:36.640 --> 1:03:42.480]  know i take it in the morning before work and i'd have this burst of energy clarity and focus that
[1:03:42.480 --> 1:03:48.320]  i've never had before alex well you gotta have it for electrochemical activity in the brain uh but
[1:03:48.320 --> 1:03:54.080]  but exactly at first though it's gonna push out of your cells the bad halogens bromine
[1:03:54.080 --> 1:03:58.160]  chloride fluoride and that's why you're gonna be depressed and feel like crap for about three
[1:03:58.160 --> 1:04:01.920]  weeks that's what most people have i'll just be honest with people there's there's but but three
[1:04:01.920 --> 1:04:07.120]  weeks later i like it you ever like carry your kid on your shoulders upstairs and as soon as you
[1:04:07.120 --> 1:04:10.800]  take them off your shoulders you feel like you're flying after three weeks of that it was like all
[1:04:10.800 --> 1:04:16.880]  the sudden i woke up one day i was like what the hell's going on here exactly and you see i got my
[1:04:16.880 --> 1:04:22.160]  kids on it before they can get all of the poisonous toxins in their body i wanted to get them with the
[1:04:22.160 --> 1:04:29.680]  iodine and you know get them as clear as i can get them it's amazing dr grip warned me he said look
[1:04:29.680 --> 1:04:34.240]  he tried for like a year to get me taken i'm like yeah right iodine you're a hippie and his hippies
[1:04:34.240 --> 1:04:40.480]  are always going to take iodine and then man like i feel like crap about a week or two into it's
[1:04:40.480 --> 1:04:44.160]  about a week i was like man this sucks he goes hey just keep taking it watch what happens and i go
[1:04:44.160 --> 1:04:52.480]  woke up one day and i was like whoa this is crazy thank you so much leo god bless you more calls in 60 seconds stay with us

[1:06:32.720 --> 1:06:40.400]  calls here let me make this statement and again a lot of things i say are super obvious so i i'm
[1:06:40.400 --> 1:06:45.920]  not insulting your intelligence but it's celebrating those big obvious things that i found leads to
[1:06:45.920 --> 1:06:52.880]  victory the basics the jeffrey ebbstein case and the fact that they covered it up and the and the
[1:06:52.880 --> 1:06:59.120]  child kidnapping blackmail rings really was a sea change for people because they'd all heard that
[1:06:59.120 --> 1:07:04.240]  for decades that was going on and they knew that we'd been harping on it and when that all turned
[1:07:04.240 --> 1:07:14.000]  out to be true and when they killed him to try to cover it up it was a sea change and there have
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:21.360]  been other events that have happened as well that have just really marked the signpost of the big
[1:07:21.360 --> 1:07:30.720]  awakening but let me tell you something when roger stone worked here for a couple years i've
[1:07:30.720 --> 1:07:36.160]  been chatting i'd say man you tell the best next stories you have the best political commentary
[1:07:36.800 --> 1:07:43.760]  i said i hired you to cover the news and talk about what's going on you're really interesting
[1:07:43.760 --> 1:07:51.200]  i don't want to hear how you're innocent and how it's all a witch hunt because our listeners know
[1:07:51.200 --> 1:07:56.400]  that roger when you go on fox news do it but just do not and he just would not listen to me
[1:07:56.400 --> 1:08:02.160]  and i get it he was falsely accused or trying to put him in jail they didn't end up indicting him
[1:08:02.160 --> 1:08:12.960]  but our listeners know he's not a russian agent it's a bunch of bs but now it is as big as ebbstein
[1:08:12.960 --> 1:08:17.920]  i mean people are so pissed they know roger did nothing they know there's no russia proof
[1:08:17.920 --> 1:08:24.480]  lying to congress when he didn't even do it people want a repudiation of russia gay we've
[1:08:24.480 --> 1:08:32.640]  been raped with this bs for four years long before trump got elected we are so sick of it
[1:08:32.640 --> 1:08:39.680]  and we want to see him pardoned as a repudiation of the bs and the deep state saying how dare you
[1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:44.560]  you can't do this you better stand down or you'll get in trouble they want to see the rightful
[1:08:44.560 --> 1:08:49.760]  exercise of power by the executive branch and a vindication of the president in this and to stop
[1:08:49.760 --> 1:08:57.920]  being cowed to stop being buffaloed to stop being dominated by this
[1:09:00.240 --> 1:09:06.880]  but aside from that as it comes out the jurors were a bunch of democrat operatives
[1:09:07.760 --> 1:09:12.320]  and as it comes out the judge is so corrupt and as it comes out they had a federal informant
[1:09:12.320 --> 1:09:19.680]  trying to set stone up and he didn't even take the bait roger exposed this two years ago on the show
[1:09:19.680 --> 1:09:26.000]  and they still use that guy to get roger indicted even though they admit he didn't do anything
[1:09:27.200 --> 1:09:32.240]  this is dangerous to everybody and
[1:09:32.240 --> 1:09:41.040]  and everybody sees through it people don't march up to me on the street anymore and say f u russian
[1:09:41.040 --> 1:09:48.320]  agent in fact democrats keep their fat ugly mouth shut now that's good i mean they can
[1:09:48.320 --> 1:09:53.360]  have their speech all day long but they don't feel so bright eyed bushy tell anymore
[1:09:56.160 --> 1:10:01.120]  they also know when they get in my face i don't back down and it's not like i'm a tough guy it's
[1:10:01.120 --> 1:10:04.400]  just a default come over and start screaming in my face i'm gonna get right back and screaming yours
[1:10:08.640 --> 1:10:12.400]  i mean it's like five cups of coffee when one of these turds gets in my face
[1:10:13.040 --> 1:10:17.120]  i'll be sitting there half half awake in some restaurant some jerk comes over and
[1:10:17.120 --> 1:10:21.600]  calls me a russian agent and knocks my glass of tea over and says they're gonna beat my ass
[1:10:21.600 --> 1:10:26.480]  i get up just go well just take a swing i've been wanting to break somebody's neck for a while
[1:10:26.480 --> 1:10:35.120]  and just get ready to get ready to die because see you're in a man's world now where your fat
[1:10:35.120 --> 1:10:39.920]  mouths put these checks out you're gonna have to cash them you understand how that works
[1:10:40.480 --> 1:10:46.080]  i'm so sick of you cowards but oh as soon as it's a real world oh wait leave me alone wait
[1:10:46.080 --> 1:10:54.800]  wait you were just gonna beat my ass you're a big guy you just came over here beat my ass
[1:10:54.800 --> 1:11:01.840]  show me tell me what it's like please let's see for the left it's all about dress up it's all about
[1:11:01.840 --> 1:11:07.200]  theater it's not the real world they just want to come threaten to beat your ass and then stand
[1:11:07.200 --> 1:11:12.640]  around in front of their buddies they don't actually want to start swinging fists let's see i do
[1:11:15.280 --> 1:11:20.000]  i want to politically swing fist i want to restore the republic i want to get these pedophiles off
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:25.360]  the backs of our children i want victory and i want it now and so do a lot of other people but
[1:11:25.360 --> 1:11:29.760]  see somebody who knows how to fight or somebody who's a man they're not gonna start a fight with me
[1:11:29.760 --> 1:11:35.200]  because they already have it they don't need to go out and prove it and that's our problem is
[1:11:35.200 --> 1:11:41.360]  as men we have to stop putting up with these globalist turd baskets and stop kissing their
[1:11:41.360 --> 1:11:45.920]  asses and stop letting them intimidate us and stop it's not even intimidation like well i don't
[1:11:45.920 --> 1:11:51.680]  want to make a scene i better just you know just kind of bow down to them and they'll go away no
[1:11:51.680 --> 1:11:56.320]  they're not going away and they're going around and messing with people that are more easily
[1:11:56.320 --> 1:12:02.720]  intimidated so it's our job as men to get back in their face aggressively i'm not looking for
[1:12:02.720 --> 1:12:06.720]  trouble but if you're looking for trouble you know the old saying you came to the right place
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:12.640]  and so people ask why freak out when they get in my face because these are bullies man these are
[1:12:12.640 --> 1:12:21.440]  the enemy and i want them to remember that it's their night that's ruined not mine i'll take
[1:12:21.440 --> 1:12:25.520]  the steak off their table when they get in my face come over to my table talk crap me i gotta
[1:12:25.520 --> 1:12:29.120]  walk over to their wife and them i go hey how's your steak i'm gonna eat your steak let's see
[1:12:29.120 --> 1:12:33.120]  because that's what it's about you came to ruin my night i'm gonna eat your steak
[1:12:36.160 --> 1:12:41.200]  because they need to know that i'm not gonna bow down to their bs and you're not gonna bow
[1:12:41.200 --> 1:12:48.080]  down anymore because we're not slaves that's all i'm saying don't tread on me that's the
[1:12:48.080 --> 1:12:53.040]  company's first symbol was a snake we're not looking for trouble but if you want to start a
[1:12:53.040 --> 1:12:59.200]  fight you came to the right area let's go ahead and take a call here we got these roger stone
[1:12:59.200 --> 1:13:04.000]  calls i'll get to once our guest is here with us next segment from jason and james and
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:09.520]  they all want to talk about roger stone so we're gonna get to that
[1:13:12.240 --> 1:13:15.840]  let's go ahead and talk to matthew in texas matthew thanks for holding her on the air
[1:13:16.960 --> 1:13:21.440]  hey alex how you doing today i'm fired up brother what are you i mean can you see the big awakening
[1:13:21.440 --> 1:13:25.600]  trump starting to push back i want to see a lot more of this but this is getting me really excited
[1:13:26.320 --> 1:13:31.120]  yeah definitely i'm excited as well it's uh it's been a long time coming it seems like three plus
[1:13:31.120 --> 1:13:36.480]  years four years maybe five years going on um that all these uh events have been happening as
[1:13:36.480 --> 1:13:42.800]  far as hillary as far as um all the corruption goes and the whole swamp preacher is attacking the
[1:13:42.800 --> 1:13:48.800]  president and attempting to impede him in in every way shape and form but um but what i
[1:13:48.800 --> 1:13:55.200]  caught about was the uh today um mayor ron nernberg from san antonio came out and he's been uh he
[1:13:55.200 --> 1:14:03.120]  talked about the corona virus about the evacuees from the hubai region and uh today we had our first
[1:14:03.120 --> 1:14:11.360]  confirmed case according to mayor ron nernberg and the cdc so it's um you know it's uh sobering
[1:14:11.360 --> 1:14:15.840]  it's really sobering to think that something like that can be in your backyard and definitely in my
[1:14:15.840 --> 1:14:21.440]  backyard i live maybe five minutes away from lachlan air force base between lachlan air force
[1:14:21.440 --> 1:14:26.560]  base and what used to be kelly air force base and um i just don't understand why they wouldn't even
[1:14:26.560 --> 1:14:34.720]  bring any sort of individuals who may be under that um infected with that have any sickness
[1:14:34.720 --> 1:14:43.680]  from anywhere overseas back onto the mainland like i'm sure they have bases and decommission
[1:14:43.680 --> 1:14:47.840]  buildings things like that well they do that's a good point well the problem is though we have
[1:14:47.840 --> 1:14:53.120]  those in third party countries they don't want it either but i mean i hear you a lot of people
[1:14:53.120 --> 1:14:58.080]  don't want to believe this virus is deadly i hope that's the case but we know it's man made and we
[1:14:58.080 --> 1:15:03.440]  know that the pentagon is really concerned about it i think for good reason i we know it's mutating
[1:15:03.440 --> 1:15:15.760]  too so i yeah it um it's uh like i said yeah it is a sobering thing to to think that uh that it's
[1:15:15.760 --> 1:15:21.360]  right here in our backyard and like i said right right in in lachlan it's just uh it's insane
[1:15:21.360 --> 1:15:25.680]  that they didn't use somewhere else somewhere like i'm even sure an island i don't want to
[1:15:25.680 --> 1:15:29.280]  say like Puerto Rico or something like that but something that's involved with the united states
[1:15:29.280 --> 1:15:34.160]  at least that they could have reached before they hit the mainland if they're already going to
[1:15:34.160 --> 1:15:40.080]  travel that far but i know um and since like maybe november here too i've been seeing a lot of
[1:15:40.080 --> 1:15:44.560]  drones flying over at night um there have been a lot of different flights but i think that might
[1:15:44.560 --> 1:15:50.080]  just be because the whole Boeing 737 max thing or whatever there's a lot of craziness brother

[1:20:35.520 --> 1:20:40.800]  over from the last hour wanting to talk about roger stone and talk to norm paddus very successful
[1:20:40.800 --> 1:20:44.800]  first amendment and of course criminal lawyer very well known you see him all over national
[1:20:44.800 --> 1:20:50.800]  television we should go ahead and make this announcement you've been talking about this
[1:20:50.800 --> 1:20:58.560]  for a few days with me we pulled the trigger earlier we are going to intervene in the roger stone
[1:20:58.560 --> 1:21:03.120]  case and we're also going to be working with mike sternovich on this but i'm going to finance it
[1:21:03.760 --> 1:21:08.240]  to go in and show in the court records which are very expensive to go with particular records
[1:21:08.880 --> 1:21:14.160]  with these jurors bragging to their democrats this other juror whose husband was a top lawyer on
[1:21:14.160 --> 1:21:17.600]  the muller probe i mean conflicts of interest that are incredible remember they called a few
[1:21:17.600 --> 1:21:21.280]  months ago from my arrest and the watch the post even though the spring court's rule it's totally
[1:21:21.280 --> 1:21:25.520]  normal to put out who jurors are for the intent of you know finding out i have a conflict i wasn't
[1:21:25.520 --> 1:21:30.000]  trying to intimidate anybody but it seems like this whole house of cards norm paddus
[1:21:31.440 --> 1:21:35.440]  is starting to collapse for them well it does and i just want to correct the record when you
[1:21:35.440 --> 1:21:40.320]  say intervene that's a term with legal significance we're not a party but my office is right now
[1:21:40.320 --> 1:21:46.160]  attempting to locate and obtain a copy of the trial transcripts what prompted my interest was a
[1:21:46.160 --> 1:21:50.720]  story that mike sternovich broke this morning that apparently one of the jurors had not just
[1:21:50.720 --> 1:21:57.200]  animosity toward trump but had run for congress as a democrat and has been sitting silently all
[1:21:57.200 --> 1:22:03.120]  this time and now couldn't hold her tongue any longer and was expressing outrage over the fact
[1:22:03.120 --> 1:22:09.040]  that these four prosecutors quit the other day so she has been him she said i want him in prison
[1:22:09.040 --> 1:22:15.040]  my view is that that sort of venom should have been detected in a normal war deer or jury selection
[1:22:15.040 --> 1:22:20.560]  process and if this stealth juror was permitted to slip through in spite of that bias um or she
[1:22:20.560 --> 1:22:25.520]  didn't disclose the bias there's actual juror misconduct and that sort of misconduct would
[1:22:25.520 --> 1:22:30.880]  necessarily result in a mistrial and a new trial for mr stone what about the separate issue norm
[1:22:31.920 --> 1:22:37.280]  of the president can pardon someone if they want so the president says oh i saw the justice
[1:22:37.280 --> 1:22:42.240]  department said that this uh sentenced the recommendations too long that's his right to
[1:22:42.240 --> 1:22:47.520]  say that but plus he could pardon him so the idea that he can't pardon him is crazy um he has the
[1:22:47.520 --> 1:22:51.840]  pardon power he has the ability to commute as well he could let the convictions stand and decide any
[1:22:51.840 --> 1:22:57.360]  sentences too long i think his role in events this week has been overstated i think what we have
[1:22:57.360 --> 1:23:02.240]  here is a routine administrative failure and you see it in the new york times this morning the among
[1:23:02.240 --> 1:23:06.640]  the four prosecutors who resigned one of the young men was a member of the public integrity unit
[1:23:06.640 --> 1:23:11.600]  it is routine business in the justice department justice department in prosecutions such as mr
[1:23:11.600 --> 1:23:17.120]  stones they have sentencing recommendations um and charging decisions run up the change of chain
[1:23:17.120 --> 1:23:23.120]  of command to washington dc this is not unusual the fact that the president saw this in the paper
[1:23:23.120 --> 1:23:28.240]  apparently surprised him and surprised some senior people in the justice department they were within
[1:23:28.240 --> 1:23:33.840]  their rights to with with recall um and withdraw the sentencing memo it's not it's not unusual
[1:23:33.840 --> 1:23:38.160]  learning that these prosecutors told the justice department that it was going to be a lighter
[1:23:38.160 --> 1:23:42.720]  recommendation that they lied reportedly in writing and then now recommended a bigger one
[1:23:42.720 --> 1:23:46.240]  these people are out of control i you know i don't know anything about that that's news to me i mean
[1:23:46.240 --> 1:23:50.960]  the sentencing guidelines themselves are a little understood reading the papers you would think that
[1:23:50.960 --> 1:23:56.480]  somehow the government has been speaking with two voices in ways that matter um it doesn't the
[1:23:56.480 --> 1:24:02.160]  sentencing guidelines are a complicated cookbook that are designed to help people uh or to to help
[1:24:02.160 --> 1:24:06.640]  a judge decide what an appropriate sentence is the federal sentencing guideline regime was created
[1:24:06.640 --> 1:24:12.720]  in the 1980s it was created to promote uniformity among the 94 federal district courts um every
[1:24:12.720 --> 1:24:17.920]  offense has what's called a base offense level whether it's seven or nine points i mean you add
[1:24:17.920 --> 1:24:22.480]  offense characteristic points to that to come up with some aggregate number for the offense in this
[1:24:22.480 --> 1:24:28.480]  case it was 29 if you put that number 29 on a table and then you move over on the criminal history
[1:24:28.480 --> 1:24:33.680]  mr stone had none so he was a one that yields a sentencing range that's where the seven to nine
[1:24:33.680 --> 1:24:39.840]  month sentencing recommendation occurred in the justice department sentencing memo it added points
[1:24:39.840 --> 1:24:45.600]  to the base offense level that arguably it shouldn't have added um for example um there was eight
[1:24:45.600 --> 1:24:51.360]  points added for physically threatening a witness i'm not sure making a comment about a dog or some
[1:24:51.360 --> 1:24:58.000]  of the off comment off color comments that stone made um to critico um constitute a physical threat
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:02.720]  and so i think the justice department withdrawing or walking back that eight points was actually
[1:25:02.720 --> 1:25:07.840]  speaking sense and i don't think sure and i don't think you needed president as trump and sentencing
[1:25:07.840 --> 1:25:15.200]  reform and judicial reform and and and prison reform but separate from that the public's mad
[1:25:15.200 --> 1:25:20.320]  about this roger stone thing they really get that this is the end of this whole fake russia gate
[1:25:20.320 --> 1:25:26.400]  fiasco and no one is is buying that he should serve seven to nine years in prison when the average
[1:25:26.400 --> 1:25:31.360]  arm robber serves less than four uh well i don't know about that but i do know that you say no one
[1:25:31.360 --> 1:25:36.240]  but i looked at the new york times editorial this morning and i was stunned by what i read i mean
[1:25:36.240 --> 1:25:42.000]  they've out and out made misrepresentations of fact the editorial reads and i quote mr stone also
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:46.400]  threatened at the federal judge presiding over his case which his lawyers chalked up to anxiety for
[1:25:46.400 --> 1:25:51.360]  which he was undergoing therapy at one point on a social media account a photograph of the judge
[1:25:51.360 --> 1:25:56.880]  appeared in near a target a targeting symbol but it wasn't even that it was like bullet points no i
[1:25:56.880 --> 1:26:01.680]  know and but that's not a threat under any conceivable stretch of the law and for the new york
[1:26:01.680 --> 1:26:06.000]  times you know the the old gray lady to come out and print an accused threatening on this record
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:11.840]  is is outrageous well it shows though they'll do anything now well and let it go they go on um
[1:26:11.840 --> 1:26:16.080]  they said the the the the the the the government had sought a prison sentence of seven to nine years
[1:26:16.080 --> 1:26:21.200]  which was within the sentencing guidelines range i don't know who the ignoramus was who wrote that
[1:26:21.200 --> 1:26:27.040]  editorial but here's a memo to the new york times yet a lawyer to read your material sentencing
[1:26:27.040 --> 1:26:32.480]  recommendations are simply arguments the government or some um lawyers within the government could
[1:26:32.480 --> 1:26:36.160]  have argued that they thought he should go to prison for seven and nine years they know that
[1:26:36.160 --> 1:26:42.160]  they're a fraud they lied about wmds and iraq this is the new york times the standard of deception
[1:26:42.160 --> 1:26:46.320]  uh you know i like the paper i read it every day but here's another whopper from their editorial
[1:26:46.320 --> 1:26:51.520]  mr trump openly interfered in the trial and sentencing of one of his oldest and staunches allies
[1:26:51.520 --> 1:26:57.120]  where did mr trump interfere in the trial the trial is a separate stage from oh yeah well when
[1:26:57.120 --> 1:27:01.760]  trump would talk about the impeachment and defend himself they said that was interfering with the
[1:27:01.760 --> 1:27:08.800]  impeachment so since when does a defendant having a voice be interference what they go on
[1:27:09.840 --> 1:27:13.600]  well this is actually the times didn't address this because i think the time still has some loyalty
[1:27:13.600 --> 1:27:18.640]  to the first amendment but consider what happened to mr stone after he was convicted um you apparently
[1:27:18.640 --> 1:27:23.280]  were brought into the trial record and the claim was that mr stone violated a gag order potentially
[1:27:23.280 --> 1:27:28.720]  by him or someone else was ostensibly reaching out to you um why mr stone wasn't in the district
[1:27:28.720 --> 1:27:33.120]  court of appeals the next day to challenge that gag order is one of the law's great mysteries in my
[1:27:33.120 --> 1:27:39.200]  mind right now oh no his lawyers have let him i have never seen a gag order because roger can't
[1:27:39.200 --> 1:27:44.400]  talk i just talked people close to roger stone and they know that those lawyers led him to the slaughter
[1:27:44.400 --> 1:27:52.880]  but the good news is the president is about to exercise his veto pen over judicial tyranny and
[1:27:52.880 --> 1:27:58.400]  is going to pardon stone he has that right and if he does i'm sure people will claim that that's an
[1:27:58.400 --> 1:28:03.760]  obstruction of justice but it's a right that every president uses um president trump has his has the
[1:28:03.760 --> 1:28:11.600]  power as the executive to um commute um or exonerate if he chooses we keep asking norm paddice uh famous
[1:28:11.600 --> 1:28:17.680]  lawyer here with me what the next scandal will be Pelosi says it's the pardon of stone so that's
[1:28:17.680 --> 1:28:22.240]  their next big scandal good that goes right back to russia gate right back to the fraud they push
[1:28:22.240 --> 1:28:26.240]  good let's just go right back in there because this will repudiate to my promise when we come back

[1:32:51.040 --> 1:32:56.080]  just bad guys coming after us there's a flip side of all the good guys and good gals it's very exciting
[1:32:56.080 --> 1:33:07.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:18.480 --> 1:33:22.000]  welcome back with one of your phone calls constitutional lawyer norm paddus is our
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:30.320]  guest on alex jones your host you were saying during the break the jurors not just one but
[1:33:30.320 --> 1:33:34.400]  multiple ones being democrat party operatives running for major office and they want to destroy
[1:33:34.400 --> 1:33:38.560]  roger stone turns out in social media before and after now that we know who their names are
[1:33:39.440 --> 1:33:45.920]  this one woman that worked in homeland security and then her husband was a lawyer on the muller probe
[1:33:45.920 --> 1:33:51.840]  high level and and the judge had said oh it's okay you can stay on but then we made an issue out of
[1:33:51.840 --> 1:33:59.920]  it and so she was let go she was cut from the jury and they said arrest me in the washington post
[1:33:59.920 --> 1:34:03.840]  but then as you pointed out that's right there in the constitution supreme court rulings
[1:34:04.560 --> 1:34:09.040]  we were doing our job but but as you were pointing out with all this coming out the fact
[1:34:09.040 --> 1:34:14.160]  they used a federal informant that they didn't tell the court wasn't informed to put out this info
[1:34:14.160 --> 1:34:22.480]  on stone that really you're saying sentencing should be postponed show that perhaps the whole the whole
[1:34:22.480 --> 1:34:26.400]  trial that's overturned or what's the process under the sixth under the sixth amendment you're
[1:34:26.400 --> 1:34:31.120]  entitled to a jury of your peers and that's a very impartial jury historically what that's
[1:34:31.120 --> 1:34:36.720]  meant is that these are jurors who have not formed views of the case so so significant that they're
[1:34:36.720 --> 1:34:41.680]  likely to affect how they evaluate the evidence in some courts that means people don't know anything
[1:34:41.680 --> 1:34:47.040]  about the parties or the participants that's rare in a high-profile case typically they just have to
[1:34:47.040 --> 1:34:51.840]  be impartial they have to set aside whatever they've heard and commit to being able to try the case
[1:34:51.840 --> 1:34:57.680]  based on the evidence in the courtroom however the the participants are entitled to an honest answer
[1:34:57.680 --> 1:35:02.880]  with respect to sources of bias that jurors may have now Mike Cernovich is reporting that one
[1:35:02.880 --> 1:35:08.800]  of the jurors had run for congress as a democrat prior to the trial it's unclear to me as I sit
[1:35:08.800 --> 1:35:14.720]  here today whether that was disclosed to the lawyers in the case this juror has now come
[1:35:14.720 --> 1:35:20.160]  forward and and written her about her outrage over the resignation of the fourth trial prosecutors
[1:35:20.160 --> 1:35:25.600]  this week suggesting that in fact she had very strong views at the time of trial if questions
[1:35:25.600 --> 1:35:30.080]  were asked about this and she didn't answer truthfully or she didn't answer honestly or she
[1:35:30.080 --> 1:35:35.120]  answered in a deceptive fashion mr. Stone's right to a fair and impartial jury under the sixth
[1:35:35.120 --> 1:35:39.760]  juror rather under the sixth amendment may have been abridged and that would be a sufficient
[1:35:39.760 --> 1:35:44.560]  reason to set the verdict aside and for him to be tried again I mean that's here but what do you
[1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:52.400]  call this hysteria where the left just abandons any pretense of jurisprudence of chivalry of
[1:35:52.400 --> 1:35:57.920]  fairness the name of getting trump and it's not worked for them so what are they going to do next
[1:35:57.920 --> 1:36:02.400]  even more corrupt I have no idea what happens next with respect to Roger Stone I view it as the
[1:36:02.400 --> 1:36:08.400]  teapot the teakettle effect this enormous head of steam was generated in 2016 and we got to never
[1:36:08.400 --> 1:36:13.280]  trump people and they began to investigate him from day one their dreams came true with the
[1:36:13.280 --> 1:36:18.240]  impeachment it failed on partisan grounds but the anger and the act hunger and the desire for
[1:36:18.240 --> 1:36:25.360]  vengeance remained I think the sentencing memorandum as to as to Roger Stone was a last gas to take a
[1:36:25.360 --> 1:36:30.320]  shot at the president and it failed and backfired so I have no idea what happened none but I'll
[1:36:30.320 --> 1:36:36.480]  stay tuned and I'll be watching well definitely they've even called Roger a consolation prize oh
[1:36:36.480 --> 1:36:42.000]  we didn't get trump let's get people like doesn't the media get like people don't like vindictiveness
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:46.800]  they don't like the courts being used for this it's like what they do it pisses people off that's
[1:36:46.800 --> 1:36:52.160]  what I'm saying why is the left so tone deaf now there is a partisan divide in this country that
[1:36:52.160 --> 1:36:57.040]  I don't understand you know some people love Trump some people hate him I live on one of the
[1:36:57.040 --> 1:37:02.800]  coasts I live in the east coast in the New Haven area um Trump is not a popular figure out there
[1:37:02.800 --> 1:37:06.640]  people are rooting against him but yet when I visit middle America I hear suspicion of the
[1:37:06.640 --> 1:37:12.240]  place where I live and great admiration for Trump that divide is going to drive this country into
[1:37:12.240 --> 1:37:17.520]  unless it's addressed and I wish the media played a leadership role and took a critical
[1:37:17.520 --> 1:37:21.520]  view of these issues the Times editorial this morning shocked me for the amount of things
[1:37:21.520 --> 1:37:25.200]  that got wrong normally when I'm reading the press I'm like everybody else I don't know
[1:37:25.200 --> 1:37:29.520]  quite what to believe I wasn't there I don't know your lawyer let's follow it closely yeah I know
[1:37:29.520 --> 1:37:33.920]  a thing or two about the criminal justice system and I know when I've been sold a bill of goods
[1:37:33.920 --> 1:37:39.360]  Donald Trump may not be your cup of tea but to use the Roger Stone drama this week which is a routine
[1:37:39.360 --> 1:37:44.880]  administrative failure as an example of quote Mr. Trump's rule of lawlessness and and and quote
[1:37:44.880 --> 1:37:48.960]  cost you credibility in my mind I say shame on the New York Times they got this one wrong
[1:37:48.960 --> 1:37:55.840]  let's go to some phone calls here thanks for holding folks um let's go ahead and talk to James
[1:37:55.840 --> 1:38:01.600]  in Indiana James thanks for holding her on the air hey guys thanks for having me I got a statement
[1:38:01.600 --> 1:38:06.560]  that I have a legal question with uh the roger stone was carried to justice the federal government
[1:38:06.560 --> 1:38:10.960]  has committed crimes all over america from theft homicide trying to overthrow the government to
[1:38:10.960 --> 1:38:15.280]  line to congress they turn a blind eye you have 60 agents taking bribes and committing crimes the
[1:38:15.280 --> 1:38:20.720]  DOJ crimes from everywhere from lying drug theft hiding and destroying evidence there will never
[1:38:20.720 --> 1:38:25.280]  be full criminal justice reform until the DOJ is restructured to help and not destroy everyone
[1:38:25.280 --> 1:38:30.080]  with trickery and lies there is no due process because everybody is convicted if this was the
[1:38:30.080 --> 1:38:34.240]  time of Lincoln all these crooks would have been headed to the gallows well you're right I think
[1:38:34.240 --> 1:38:39.600]  the federal conviction rates like 90 something percent and people just see this as emblematic
[1:38:39.600 --> 1:38:44.320]  with all the other corruption and the things they've seen people get away with and now Roger Stone
[1:38:44.320 --> 1:38:48.880]  lying to congress without even having evidence not I mean what was the question I'm not sure
[1:38:48.880 --> 1:38:53.200]  that I'm as cynical as you about the government yet I still go to court every day and expect
[1:38:53.200 --> 1:38:58.560]  justice and expect the courts to apply the rules and more often than not they do there are conspicuous
[1:38:58.560 --> 1:39:03.600]  failures and the job and it looks to me like the stone case may be one of them yeah the decision's
[1:39:03.600 --> 1:39:08.640]  been made if you're going after Trump break the rules my you know you know again I'm going to
[1:39:08.640 --> 1:39:13.840]  just comment on a case by case basis I'm sufficient I hadn't paid a close enough attention to the
[1:39:13.840 --> 1:39:19.120]  Roger Stone case apparently my office is as we speak obtaining the trial transcripts we're also
[1:39:19.120 --> 1:39:24.080]  getting the transcripts of the voir dire that is the jury selection process and any questionnaires
[1:39:24.080 --> 1:39:29.120]  jurors filled out I based on the misinformation I'm seeing in the press this week I want answers
[1:39:29.120 --> 1:39:34.240]  about that case I'm not I've not yet come to the point where I can I've concluded that my government
[1:39:34.240 --> 1:39:39.280]  is my enemy I simply don't trust it and I want answers well the caller seems corrupt cabals
[1:39:39.280 --> 1:39:44.080]  operating with its unity and hopefully what they've tried on Trump backfires and now route
[1:39:44.080 --> 1:39:50.400]  the whole group of them uh James what was your legal question sure um my legal question is because
[1:39:50.400 --> 1:39:55.760]  it was a hoax and a fraud Russia does a fruit of the poisonous tree just make this where everybody
[1:39:55.760 --> 1:40:02.160]  needs to be released from stone to even Trump's worthless lawyer absolutely sorry Norm you're
[1:40:02.160 --> 1:40:06.320]  the lawyer but if something is based on a fraud from the beginning doesn't it all get thrown
[1:40:06.320 --> 1:40:11.520]  around the wonder not necessarily the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine doctrine is a fourth
[1:40:11.520 --> 1:40:16.800]  amendment concept and it says that if evidence is seized unlawfully that is without a warrant they
[1:40:16.800 --> 1:40:21.440]  enter to your home and there's no justification for the entry they can't use that root of the
[1:40:21.440 --> 1:40:26.480]  poisonous tree of the illegal search in the case against you you know with respect to a broader
[1:40:26.480 --> 1:40:32.160]  consensus about truth and legitimacy um those aren't really legal concepts those are political
[1:40:32.160 --> 1:40:36.880]  questions and I james james your your your comments suggest that to me that the crisis
[1:40:36.880 --> 1:40:41.600]  is far deeper than one going on in legal institutions it's a very crisis of legitimacy
[1:40:41.600 --> 1:40:45.440]  whether the government actually yeah social contracting broken no that's a different that's
[1:40:45.440 --> 1:40:50.240]  really a political question not a legal question all right james thank you all right let's go ahead
[1:40:50.240 --> 1:40:55.520]  and uh talk to bobby in colorado bobby you're on here go ahead
[1:40:55.520 --> 1:41:03.280]  hi how's it going good brother go ahead yeah i just i was listening to david night show yesterday
[1:41:03.280 --> 1:41:07.760]  and you had mentioned that uh you had thought that from what you've seen of the roger stone trial
[1:41:07.760 --> 1:41:11.600]  that you thought he did lie to congress i was hoping you could elaborate on that i hadn't
[1:41:11.600 --> 1:41:15.200]  paid a lot of attention bobby i'll be honest with you you know i'm a busy lawyer i've got clients
[1:41:15.200 --> 1:41:19.520]  i go to court every day so i'm reading the newspaper and maybe i'm reading what a poison
[1:41:19.520 --> 1:41:24.000]  depressed but it seemed to me that he had said at one point he that he'd made statements that were
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:28.880]  inconsistent with one another uh at one point he said he he had contacts with assange and other
[1:41:28.880 --> 1:41:33.680]  points he said he didn't make attempts to get information both can't be true if he said both
[1:41:33.680 --> 1:41:38.880]  to congress then he lied the question would then be did he have the intent to lie or was he bs and
[1:41:38.880 --> 1:41:43.840]  or was he tall you know or did they misconstrue his his uh when he says i'm trying to talk to wikileaks
[1:41:43.840 --> 1:41:47.520]  that that means he's trying to talk to doesn't mean he talked to him and i think there was some
[1:41:47.520 --> 1:41:51.840]  claims that he said at one point or at least led people to believe he did and this is the reason
[1:41:51.840 --> 1:41:56.080]  alex that we're ordering the trial transcript today i i will admit to you and to your viewers
[1:41:56.080 --> 1:41:59.600]  i didn't pay attention to the trial here i am talking about it wouldn't that makes me as
[1:41:59.600 --> 1:42:04.000]  bad as the new york times i suppose but i want answers and i'm going to read that trial transcript
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:08.240]  and when i do i'll come back and say regardless the things politically motivated so it's all
[1:42:08.240 --> 1:42:14.000]  a fraud to begin with um you know i can't go that far i'm still an officer of the court when i
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:18.640]  represent a client in a courtroom i believe that i can obtain something like justice for them if i
[1:42:18.640 --> 1:42:24.000]  didn't believe that i'd quit practice in law all right anything else bobby yeah i was i was here
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:29.920]  in colorado and uh we got uh governor polis and you know we all voted to shut down proposition 112
[1:42:29.920 --> 1:42:34.720]  and then they brought in senate bill 181 and you know they're just taking over they brought in the
[1:42:34.720 --> 1:42:42.880]  red flag laws they put a ban on our energy rights i mean this is uh the democrats have you know across
[1:42:42.880 --> 1:42:47.600]  the board across the nation they have the same proper they you know the same system they're
[1:42:47.600 --> 1:42:52.000]  putting in place everywhere that's right it's a plan for tyranny it's a global government we've
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:58.640]  got to resist it thank you so much bobby almost all the other big storable food companies are
[1:42:58.640 --> 1:43:03.360]  sold out of food but i know for a fact from sources to tell them people oh we've got it get your order
[1:43:03.360 --> 1:43:08.640]  in two weeks for delivery we follow this pattern over and over again i've been on radio for 25 years
[1:43:08.640 --> 1:43:12.880]  i've had storable food for a long time and i learned very quickly a lot of these companies
[1:43:12.880 --> 1:43:17.520]  they're fine during normal times during a crisis they don't keep a bunch of food on hand because
[1:43:17.520 --> 1:43:22.320]  of inventory they'll still take your orders that's why about 11 years ago i found my patriot supply
[1:43:22.320 --> 1:43:27.040]  now the biggest most trusted company out there and i became a private labeler for them because they
[1:43:27.040 --> 1:43:30.240]  actually have it on hand they actually give it delivered to you on time they do what they're
[1:43:30.240 --> 1:43:33.600]  going to say they're going to do because they want you as a customer over and over again
[1:43:33.600 --> 1:43:37.280]  and they're good people now they were saying seven to ten days before shipping because they've got
[1:43:37.280 --> 1:43:43.200]  the food but they got a package at record level orders now it's 10 to 14 because it's only intensifying
[1:43:43.200 --> 1:43:48.080]  with the coronavirus so get your orders in an info warsaw.com get the best deals get it delivered
[1:43:48.080 --> 1:43:52.640]  first they're in our system it goes right to them then it funds the info as well so get prepared
[1:43:52.640 --> 1:43:59.680]  info warsaw.com with swivel foods i have confirmed with high-level sources that president trump is
[1:43:59.680 --> 1:44:05.040]  intending to either pardon roger stone after his sentencing or give him clemency saying the
[1:44:05.040 --> 1:44:12.320]  conviction stands but you now basically don't go to jail either way this is incredibly good news but
[1:44:12.320 --> 1:44:17.760]  let's not forget julien assange that's one of the biggest black marks on trump is that he famously
[1:44:17.760 --> 1:44:22.240]  said i don't know who got the emails i don't know where they came from the russians a fat
[1:44:22.240 --> 1:44:27.120]  dude in his mom's basement whoever's got him release him it's about hillary committing a crime
[1:44:27.120 --> 1:44:32.000]  not who has the emails don't change the subject well julien assange undoubtedly took trump over
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:37.520]  the top the wiki leaks expose the deep state the man is a hero daniel elsberg was a hero well
[1:44:37.520 --> 1:44:42.000]  assange is even a bigger hero and he's rotting in solitary confinement and the court hearings can
[1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:47.680]  barely talk president trump do the right thing and ask the british to release julien assange
[1:44:47.680 --> 1:45:01.600]  and give him a medal there's roughly only 260 days left until the 2020 election and already you've
[1:45:01.600 --> 1:45:05.600]  seen all sorts of crazy things happen the globalists are trying to plunge the economy they're trying
[1:45:05.600 --> 1:45:09.760]  to start wars they're trying to overthrow the president they're trying to silence free speech

[1:46:55.040 --> 1:47:10.960]  victory in our time you're listening to the alex jones show

[1:47:39.840 --> 1:47:47.440]  with the team with calls as well but look at this Cambridge academic says human race must
[1:47:47.440 --> 1:47:53.920]  become extinct to save the planet that's that a whole extinction rebellion and guess what she's
[1:47:53.920 --> 1:48:01.280]  got madusa on her arm and devil tattoos and is into nihilism and destruction well hey here's the
[1:48:01.280 --> 1:48:06.640]  deal honey you just get yourself a big old tank of vodka and some barbiturates and kill yourself
[1:48:07.440 --> 1:48:11.520]  because uh you're into death you're into destruction you've given up on humanity i don't
[1:48:11.520 --> 1:48:16.800]  want you to kill yourself i'm just simply telling you you got that broadcast go take care of it
[1:48:16.800 --> 1:48:22.640]  get the bathtub slip those rest go see jesus and i don't mean that to be mean here but you know
[1:48:22.640 --> 1:48:28.000]  they're pushing abortion they're saying humans suck let's get rid of humanity and of course
[1:48:29.280 --> 1:48:35.760]  she's a vampire she wants us to decide to give up our life force so this clown can feed on us
[1:48:36.560 --> 1:48:45.520]  so again lady lead by example i'll give her some respect if she jumps off a building today
[1:48:45.520 --> 1:48:50.240]  or slits her wrist and again i'm not saying she should do that she just says we should all die
[1:48:50.240 --> 1:48:57.120]  well her first norm wow i mean i i don't know where how even to what what to make of that what's
[1:48:57.120 --> 1:49:02.080]  her loyalty to the planet that she somehow sacrifices her loyalty to the human race
[1:49:02.080 --> 1:49:07.840]  certainly we have challenges to survive and um he appears to be one of them i mean taking one
[1:49:07.840 --> 1:49:13.440]  look at her i can see why the human race might go extinct well yeah no wonder i mean i don't want
[1:49:13.440 --> 1:49:18.320]  to have any babies with her yeah no she's obviously a death war super she's a death cult person
[1:49:18.320 --> 1:49:23.360]  and this is who our academics are this is who the system wants us to hear from so i'm just telling
[1:49:23.360 --> 1:49:29.360]  her i hope she doesn't commit suicide but lady you go first i just had someone close to me commit
[1:49:29.360 --> 1:49:33.520]  suicides i don't wish that on anyone but i mean this business that somehow we need to become extinct
[1:49:33.520 --> 1:49:39.200]  to save the planet is asinine well looks like she watched too many maleficent cartoons or something
[1:49:39.200 --> 1:49:43.520]  or little mermaid witch gets up i mean because no i think when she was you know who do you want to
[1:49:43.520 --> 1:49:48.400]  be when you grew up i think she heard her she was looking for cruella deville that was who she wanted
[1:49:48.400 --> 1:49:54.400]  to be and that's what cruella deville would be like if she were a phd academic um if i sent my
[1:49:54.400 --> 1:49:59.200]  kid off to college and she sent me home a report this is what he taught i think i'd ask for my
[1:49:59.200 --> 1:50:04.000]  tuition money back i was about to say you know she's got a pentagram on her hip oh you knew that
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:13.520]  um oh my god i mean just another devil worshiper again i just i just want her to go first
[1:50:13.520 --> 1:50:19.120]  try to pour gasoline all over so and i go easy elix and great we all need we're all in need of
[1:50:19.120 --> 1:50:24.000]  grace and she needs it to work i mean you know go easy she wants us all to die just saying let's go
[1:50:25.200 --> 1:50:30.880]  you know that song from elix yeah i hear you let's go let's go let's go let's go my heart
[1:50:30.880 --> 1:50:37.760]  let's yourself go my heart goes out to her come on honey you ain't got no place to go just put
[1:50:37.760 --> 1:50:46.720]  your arms around me real tight there are many forms of death do what don't honestly let's talk
[1:50:46.720 --> 1:50:50.400]  about trump or politics or talk about her putting gasoline all over her body like
[1:50:52.720 --> 1:50:57.120]  norm i i misbehaved with your hair i hope she lives a long life hope she doesn't do that it's
[1:50:57.120 --> 1:51:02.320]  dangerous we don't want to harm a little hair on her little witch head all have sinned and fallen
[1:51:02.320 --> 1:51:06.640]  short of the glory of god some have fallen further than others she's taken a precipitous yeah well
[1:51:06.640 --> 1:51:10.400]  she's up there flapping around like a vampire bat telling us to kill ourselves i'm just simply saying
[1:51:10.400 --> 1:51:17.440]  i i i just say kill yourself well that's given her what she wants i'm i'm i think that the power
[1:51:17.440 --> 1:51:21.520]  of love and the power of grace is overwhelming it certainly has transformed my life and i hope it would
[1:51:21.520 --> 1:51:30.080]  hurt gasoline would too as well norm i'm having a little bit of fun you're you got me and you know
[1:51:30.080 --> 1:51:35.760]  it takes a lot to make me speechless you have that gift you've been here a few times where i've
[1:51:35.760 --> 1:51:40.880]  gone a little crazy on air you've rendered me speechless more than once you got look you got
[1:51:40.880 --> 1:51:46.000]  roger stone lovingly looking over your shoulder oh roger roger i think his sentencing will be
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:51.440]  postponed next week enough questions have arisen about jury tainted jury um and then the shenanigans
[1:51:51.440 --> 1:51:56.160]  with the prosecutors i i think his jury's look or his sentencing rather should be sent uh should
[1:51:56.160 --> 1:52:01.840]  be postponed while the dust settled that's the jurist prudent saying i want to agree with you
[1:52:01.840 --> 1:52:07.280]  from your perspective but trump is about to pardon him and piss in the face of the establishments we
[1:52:07.280 --> 1:52:11.840]  need that if trump you know i mean again i'm a lawyer so i'm always looking at what people
[1:52:11.840 --> 1:52:15.840]  can do within the rule of law he has that right no i think judge jackson will probably do it just
[1:52:15.840 --> 1:52:21.280]  to change the subject we'll do what sentencing no postpone it well i mean she should i mean the
[1:52:21.280 --> 1:52:24.800]  climate he's entitled to fair and impartial proceedings and right now there's a climate
[1:52:24.800 --> 1:52:29.520]  of hysteria that's descended across washington as to him and i don't think he can get a fair
[1:52:29.520 --> 1:52:33.440]  and impartial proceeding right now there are too many questions about what's gone on and why
[1:52:33.440 --> 1:52:39.200]  but let's wait what's the rush to justice there is there need be no rush you know when somebody
[1:52:39.200 --> 1:52:45.520]  says we should kill humanity i do have a problem with them i do too um and you know i'd like to
[1:52:45.520 --> 1:52:51.360]  know more about her i've heard about these people before and these sort of death cults i i simply
[1:52:51.360 --> 1:52:56.400]  don't understand it um i just don't wish death on anyone i mean it comes to all of us and too soon
[1:52:56.400 --> 1:53:00.880]  no one gets out of here alive the fact that she's trying to rush the process and wishing it on me
[1:53:00.880 --> 1:53:06.080]  obviously i'm not feeling the love she's like a like a baby vampire bat well you know i mean
[1:53:06.080 --> 1:53:10.160]  people make comments about me and my hair so i'm not going to comment on her well you know
[1:53:10.160 --> 1:53:15.760]  she's not like they shall viral look good with that haircut he's not my type you know he's not
[1:53:15.760 --> 1:53:21.120]  your type i'll say that well she's gotten her 15 minutes of fame but remember she's praying on
[1:53:21.120 --> 1:53:24.960]  people at that college with all her medusa wear and all the rest of this and i'm just saying she's
[1:53:24.960 --> 1:53:29.760]  par for the course with like little gretta thunberg's like i think what's happening a little demonic
[1:53:29.760 --> 1:53:33.520]  chicken runs around but you know i think what's happened in the last couple centuries is that
[1:53:33.520 --> 1:53:38.960]  we've had a crisis in our ideals um we've taken the yeah we got a bunch of death loving slugs running
[1:53:38.960 --> 1:53:44.160]  around running things we've taken pluralism perhaps a little too seriously and we're afraid to call
[1:53:44.160 --> 1:53:49.040]  bsbs and i think what she's spouting is bs and you're right to call her on yeah i mean she's like
[1:53:49.040 --> 1:53:55.200]  one of the count draculas brides or something i mean don't tell me if you didn't bring her a baby
[1:53:55.200 --> 1:54:00.000]  she wouldn't just bite right at i mean i i'm just saying that these people should be rejected
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:04.320]  completely there's no business teaching at a public college in my house she does it she she
[1:54:04.320 --> 1:54:08.880]  looks she should be in a mental institution in a in a society in which we are unable to distinguish
[1:54:08.880 --> 1:54:14.480]  better from worse any nonsense will do and so this is now being taught in a public university that is
[1:54:14.480 --> 1:54:19.520]  the pluralism taken to an extreme not all ideas are worthwhile there is such a thing as human
[1:54:19.520 --> 1:54:23.440]  excellence the commitment of the human race should be the human flourishing calling for our
[1:54:23.440 --> 1:54:29.280]  extinction is inconsistent with that she's got a problem with and with all the quote emperor palpatine
[1:54:29.280 --> 1:54:34.640]  no no no you will die uh let's go ahead and take a caller here who's been holding the longest for
[1:54:34.640 --> 1:54:38.480]  norm paddus that would be
[1:54:43.840 --> 1:54:49.680]  it's gonna fun noise uh that's that's inside her head let's tune to what's going on her head
[1:54:50.960 --> 1:54:53.360]  sounds like a soundtrack from the exorcist you know
[1:54:53.360 --> 1:54:56.720]  uh
[1:54:56.720 --> 1:54:59.440]  sorry uh steven florida you're on the air go ahead
[1:55:02.080 --> 1:55:04.720]  first non-colonel long long-time listener
[1:55:06.240 --> 1:55:12.080]  sorry there's seven and a half years in a prison prison federal prison and locked up with people
[1:55:12.080 --> 1:55:18.960]  who was uh on cause rate by mary joe white so this 96 97 seven percent conviction rate is true
[1:55:18.960 --> 1:55:23.840]  yeah not certainly is yeah the uh welcome back to the world very question for you
[1:55:24.480 --> 1:55:30.480]  this question i'm the uh before i get started i just want to let you know this is your top three
[1:55:30.480 --> 1:55:35.360]  products the vaso beats i had a four pack in my app now i've got a six pack the iodine
[1:55:35.360 --> 1:55:40.880]  i think x2 and x3 i know i did put the fluoride in the water because your pituitary gland or your
[1:55:40.880 --> 1:55:45.520]  third eyes will connect you to the infinite creator exactly do that it's calcified then
[1:55:45.520 --> 1:55:49.200]  they suck you in on the phone the people think they're getting smarter from the phone their phone
[1:55:49.200 --> 1:55:53.840]  sucking your information my first product has to be the coffee in the water i give people that
[1:55:53.840 --> 1:56:01.200]  water and coffee and they can't believe um as i said i was at the uh the closing statement
[1:56:01.200 --> 1:56:05.200]  for the roger's phone trial and you're asking you didn't hear the transcript no i didn't did
[1:56:05.200 --> 1:56:11.440]  was he act he would shift to the act and he said do you have any contact emails with this third party
[1:56:11.440 --> 1:56:16.000]  he's like i'm here for the russian investigation i had no contact dealing with russia they asked
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:20.240]  the same question again and he said it again he asked the same question again and rogan said
[1:56:20.240 --> 1:56:24.720]  finally someone said i didn't have any contact and then he moved on and then what they did was
[1:56:24.720 --> 1:56:30.000]  you see from a whole year he had a little four thousand contacts with him so they spun it that way
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:36.080]  for the jury tampering he had he said f muller take the fifth they're like you see that's jury
[1:56:36.080 --> 1:56:41.520]  tampering that's not jury tampering and then he was also in the and uh the president was talking
[1:56:41.520 --> 1:56:46.640]  about it was on the phone they knew it was roger stone he said well done hung up the phone and they
[1:56:46.640 --> 1:56:53.360]  said you see he's talking to i mean he could have had talking about a state or a hamburger oh yeah
[1:56:53.360 --> 1:56:58.160]  they make it all about proving russian gay through roger even though the indictment has nothing to
[1:56:58.160 --> 1:57:02.080]  do with russia well one thing that appellate lawyers will look at in the stone case is whether
[1:57:02.080 --> 1:57:07.040]  the evidence was sufficient to support uh the verdict the sufficiency of the evidence test
[1:57:07.040 --> 1:57:11.520]  goes something like this if in the record as a whole there's evidence that any reasonable jury
[1:57:11.520 --> 1:57:16.640]  could believe juror could believe that is consistent with guilt then he loses if it's as you say it is
[1:57:16.640 --> 1:57:21.360]  that this was not even a close call that verdict will be set aside unfortunately it looks like
[1:57:21.360 --> 1:57:28.000]  he's gonna have to take that appeal but president prom's gonna yeah but when he does when he does
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:34.240]  that that ends the discussion right there he has a really endless yes hold on we'll be right back
[1:57:34.240 --> 1:57:38.560]  stay there don't hang up steven you have more you wanted to say and then we're going to continue
[1:57:38.560 --> 1:57:48.160]  broadcasting forward with another special guest that i've yet not announced this should really be
[1:57:48.160 --> 1:57:54.720]  easier than it is i'm not here giving you a sales pitch i'm pointing out the way forward
[1:57:54.720 --> 1:58:00.720]  things that i've discovered that i absolutely know work that if you listen to me and try them out
[1:58:00.720 --> 1:58:07.520]  for yourself you will see how amazing it is and then your support of the product we're selling
[1:58:07.520 --> 1:58:15.040]  will help you and will help us and it's symbiotic my friends i harp and harp and harp about iodine
[1:58:15.040 --> 1:58:20.240]  because it's the good halogen fluoride the bad halogen and people told me about it for years
[1:58:20.240 --> 1:58:25.680]  and i didn't listen and i'm so thankful that finally i listened to dr grip like eight years
[1:58:25.680 --> 1:58:34.240]  ago and started taking true iodine atomic iodine we've got it back in stock x2 40% off right now
[1:58:34.240 --> 1:58:40.560]  at infowarstore.com and i'm telling you folks get it it's amazing discover the benefits
[1:58:40.560 --> 1:58:44.160]  and it funds the info war a 360 win you can't lose unless you don't take action
[1:58:44.160 --> 1:58:52.240]  if you understand why the globalist why the servants of satan hate info wars it's because
[1:58:52.240 --> 1:58:59.600]  we're awake we're alive we're passionate and we're not giving up that's why it's critical
[1:58:59.600 --> 1:59:05.440]  for those of us that are aware of the new world order's plans to not get down when they attack us
[1:59:05.440 --> 1:59:10.640]  and they persecute us and they lie about us that's what we should expect because we are
[1:59:10.640 --> 1:59:15.840]  hurting these scumbags the globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side
[1:59:15.840 --> 1:59:20.880]  and they do what they do because they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to
[1:59:20.880 --> 1:59:27.440]  suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent it is up to us who are awake not the sheep and not
[1:59:27.440 --> 1:59:35.280]  the wolves but the sheepdogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants they fear the fact
[1:59:35.280 --> 1:59:42.400]  that we are awake they fear the fact that we are alive they fear the fact that we love god
[1:59:42.400 --> 1:59:45.920]  and that's all we ever have to know is that god is in charge
[1:59:45.920 --> 2:00:02.400]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:16.880 --> 2:00:23.040]  waging war on corruption crashing the lies of disinformation norm passes are with us
[2:00:23.680 --> 2:00:28.000]  steven fordy had one other point you want to make go ahead just two of the points in the
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:32.480]  question i'll just let you know i was in the overflow jury for roger stone and it was funny
[2:00:32.480 --> 2:00:37.920]  because the prosecution and the prosecution gives their their their statement and then when roger
[2:00:37.920 --> 2:00:41.840]  stones the journey come up his microphone was turned off you couldn't even hear a word he said
[2:00:41.840 --> 2:00:46.560]  and then when the prosecution goes up again to give the second thing their microphone was turned
[2:00:46.560 --> 2:00:52.560]  way high i'm like it was purposely turned off and the other thing is that on the day of deliberation
[2:00:53.120 --> 2:00:58.080]  one of the jurors was sick it's funny you know she turned the judge was like oh you know this
[2:00:58.080 --> 2:01:01.600]  journey couldn't make it for the last day i'll bet you that was the juror that couldn't be
[2:01:01.600 --> 2:01:05.840]  compromised to go the other way so that's something you might want to look at yeah that was the old
[2:01:05.840 --> 2:01:11.680]  lady that was bleeding in the hallway it might have moved something but it was odd at the last day
[2:01:11.680 --> 2:01:18.400]  but my question is i said i've been behind bars and would it have been better for roger stone
[2:01:18.400 --> 2:01:24.000]  to represent himself yes maybe even you know maybe even say you know temporary insanity
[2:01:25.120 --> 2:01:30.320]  well because you know well given the results it couldn't have been much worse right i mean seven
[2:01:30.320 --> 2:01:35.840]  to nine years for nominal offenses i mean serious offenses which is sustainable you know as a problem
[2:01:35.840 --> 2:01:39.680]  but there's a maximum law i'm sure you heard it from folks a person who represents themselves
[2:01:39.680 --> 2:01:44.880]  has a fool for a client courtrooms are stressful places there's a lot to the law my conviction
[2:01:44.880 --> 2:01:49.120]  is in 90 percent of cases the lawyer doesn't matter the case is going to work out the way it's
[2:01:49.120 --> 2:01:53.440]  going to work out in 10 percent of cases lawyers do matter and then you want a good lawyer
[2:01:53.440 --> 2:01:57.680]  roger's case sounds like a close case from what i'm hearing and i'm sorry i didn't pay attention
[2:01:57.680 --> 2:02:03.360]  to it as i said my office is today arranging to get copies of the trial transcripts and
[2:02:03.360 --> 2:02:07.680]  if it's as close a case as you say it is he's probably got excellent grounds on appeal but
[2:02:07.680 --> 2:02:12.240]  from what alex is telling and he's not going to need it donald's gonna the trump's gonna
[2:02:12.240 --> 2:02:16.720]  gonna pardon him he has to do it thank you steve all right who's up next here
[2:02:21.840 --> 2:02:23.440]  let's go ahead and take a call

[2:02:46.880 --> 2:02:58.480]  and if a lawyer from ermina a police investigator goes and falsifies evidence in a trial which is
[2:02:58.480 --> 2:03:04.640]  the which is the rut what they did the russia hoax they throw all his they throw it all out
[2:03:04.640 --> 2:03:13.520]  and they also sometimes go after the guy that created it so white doesn't trump going like
[2:03:13.520 --> 2:03:18.240]  blanketly say that all of the convictions for the russian investigation should be thrown out
[2:03:19.120 --> 2:03:22.400]  well that's it the democrats are acting like he doesn't have that power and that's another
[2:03:22.400 --> 2:03:26.640]  obstruction of justice that's separation of powers it's right there in the executive power
[2:03:26.640 --> 2:03:30.880]  if the only check on that it would be voters saying they think it's wrong i don't think a
[2:03:30.880 --> 2:03:36.640]  presidential pardon it could even be the product for another impeachment am i wrong norm well i mean
[2:03:36.640 --> 2:03:41.040]  given the standard which is a race to the bottom i don't know what obstruction of justice means in
[2:03:41.040 --> 2:03:44.880]  congress's view and a high crime and misdemeanor needn't be a crime we learned according to the
[2:03:44.880 --> 2:03:50.240]  democrat theory but if they disagree with the president's decision enough they may gather the
[2:03:50.240 --> 2:03:54.640]  votes to impeach on political grounds but if we have a second impeachment inquiry it's going to end
[2:03:54.640 --> 2:03:58.880]  up as the way the first one did and it's going to play right into the republicans hands so i think
[2:03:58.880 --> 2:04:02.960]  from trump's perspective bring it on let's have the election i think he's feeling pretty confident
[2:04:02.960 --> 2:04:12.720]  about 2020 good point thank you greg all right norm you're flying back into uh you're abode

[2:04:49.600 --> 2:04:52.400]  and now they've made themselves obsolete i told them that would happen

[2:05:51.920 --> 2:06:06.400]  form of b12 today with ultra 12 back in november former trump advisor roger stone was convicted
[2:06:06.400 --> 2:06:11.680]  of several charges related to the now officially discredited russia investigation prosecutors
[2:06:11.680 --> 2:06:16.400]  claimed that stone lied about communicating with a former stand-up comedian called randy credit
[2:06:16.400 --> 2:06:22.320]  co a man whose role in the story was so minor that it's already been lost to history for this
[2:06:22.320 --> 2:06:28.320]  offense prosecutors say stone who was 67 years old and has no criminal record must spend up to
[2:06:28.320 --> 2:06:34.880]  nine years in prison now for perspective on that sentence the typical rapist in this country spends
[2:06:34.880 --> 2:06:40.240]  four years in prison armed robbers three years thugs who commit violent assault less than a
[2:06:40.240 --> 2:06:48.480]  year and a half but roger stone must do nine years until he is 76 years old for lying now
[2:06:48.480 --> 2:06:53.680]  there's some irony here so-called criminal justice reform is fashionable in washington right now an
[2:06:53.680 --> 2:06:58.640]  awful lot of sex offenders and drug dealers and other predators serious predators have been released
[2:06:58.640 --> 2:07:04.640]  early from prison lately it's compassionate they're telling us yet somehow nobody in dc believes
[2:07:04.640 --> 2:07:10.400]  that compassion ought to extend to roger stone who's guilty of nonviolent essentially political
[2:07:10.400 --> 2:07:16.240]  offenses notice the opposite the usual moralizers seem gleeful at the thought that stone will
[2:07:16.240 --> 2:07:22.480]  die in a cell cnn has been especially ghoulish on the subject you'll remember that prosecutors
[2:07:22.480 --> 2:07:26.960]  tipped off jeff zucker's network last year so they could have cameras in place when dozens of
[2:07:26.960 --> 2:07:32.320]  federal agents armed with automatic weapons dragged roger stone from his home at dawn talk about
[2:07:32.320 --> 2:07:37.840]  state tv for the last two days the hyenas on cnn have been driven to hysteria by the thought
[2:07:37.840 --> 2:07:45.600]  of the justice department might reduce roger stone sentence even by a day it is clearly utterly
[2:07:45.600 --> 2:07:53.120]  offensive to the rule of law this is what sets this country apart this is what a banana republic
[2:07:53.120 --> 2:08:01.360]  does this is what a dictator does it is outrageous i hope people are infuriated by this the reason
[2:08:01.360 --> 2:08:10.640]  they're doing it is slimy sleazy dirty roger stone is somebody i hold in minimum high esteem so i
[2:08:10.640 --> 2:08:17.600]  was not unhappy to see him get seven to nine but i didn't think that was too aggressive i thought it
[2:08:17.600 --> 2:08:25.440]  was aggressive wait a second was that really john dean telling you how happy he is that roger stone
[2:08:25.440 --> 2:08:32.800]  will die in jail so cnn's moral arbiter on questions of law and order is literally a convicted felon
[2:08:33.680 --> 2:08:38.960]  it's enough to make your head spin but at least it's now clear what's actually going on this is a
[2:08:38.960 --> 2:08:45.520]  pure political hit roger stone is facing prison because he is a high-profile donald trump supporter
[2:08:45.520 --> 2:08:50.560]  it's that simple you want proof here it is john brennan and james clapper will sleep at home
[2:08:50.560 --> 2:08:56.560]  tonight both have been caught lying under oath on camera about matters of national importance
[2:08:56.560 --> 2:09:02.960]  and yet neither is in jail neither has been indicted neither ever will be the stone case by
[2:09:02.960 --> 2:09:08.640]  contrast was transparently political from day one the lead prosecutor andrew weissman is now
[2:09:08.640 --> 2:09:14.400]  literally an msnbc contributor the judge in the case amy berman jackson is an out of control
[2:09:14.400 --> 2:09:19.040]  democratic partisan who purely out of spite stripped roger stone of his first amendment
[2:09:19.040 --> 2:09:23.680]  rights and prevented him from making a living coming on this show for example speaking at all
[2:09:23.680 --> 2:09:30.640]  in public now stone and his wife who is 71 years old and death have lost their home because of this
[2:09:30.640 --> 2:09:37.120]  they have no insurance they're utterly broke the whole thing is shocking and it's disgusting
[2:09:37.120 --> 2:09:42.160]  it's a farce that discredits the entire american justice system the president seems to understand
[2:09:42.160 --> 2:09:48.560]  that cannot allow this miscarriage of justice he tweeted recently he's right on a couple of levels
[2:09:48.560 --> 2:09:52.720]  what's happening to roger stone is totally wrong it's immoral and we should not allow it in this
[2:09:52.720 --> 2:09:58.960]  country but politically it has significance too stone's prosecution was designed in part to confirm
[2:09:58.960 --> 2:10:04.240]  the fantasies that democrats have constructed to explain the outcome of the 2016 election
[2:10:04.240 --> 2:10:09.920]  his conviction helps their case in other words if the russia collusion story was a hoax and of
[2:10:09.920 --> 2:10:15.040]  course it most certainly was a hoax then why is roger stone going to prison for his role in it
[2:10:15.040 --> 2:10:22.080]  if roger stone serves even a single day behind bars the russia lie will be validated as true
[2:10:22.960 --> 2:10:28.640]  stone's imprisonment will be prima facie evidence in the view of democrats so at this point there's
[2:10:28.640 --> 2:10:34.080]  really only one solution the president must pardon roger stone or commute his sentence
[2:10:34.080 --> 2:10:39.440]  before he goes to jail democrats will howl if he does that well they're howling anyway they howl
[2:10:39.440 --> 2:10:45.040]  every day chuck schumer is now yelping about yet another investigation into roger stone russia gate
[2:10:45.040 --> 2:10:52.400]  two in one entirely constitutional act the president could save roger stone's life vindicate
[2:10:52.400 --> 2:11:00.480]  himself and end this nonsense forever let's hope he does it we'll be watching all right i don't
[2:11:00.480 --> 2:11:08.800]  normally play hole tucker carlsson segments but he's the babe ruth of populist nationalist
[2:11:08.800 --> 2:11:14.400]  television and we're really blessed that he finally has freedom at fox do he wants so we can see the
[2:11:14.400 --> 2:11:22.960]  real tucker carlsson and not that libertarian-esque thing we saw on cnn and i sleep better at night
[2:11:22.960 --> 2:11:28.320]  knowing he's up there because you know they've tried to railroad me into prison and that's not
[2:11:28.320 --> 2:11:32.880]  something that's publicly known as much but people like tucker carlsson do know about it
[2:11:33.600 --> 2:11:36.960]  and i can tell you as soon as they figured out the tucker knew about it they backed off real quick
[2:11:36.960 --> 2:11:41.360]  so that'll really make you like somebody too when they're keeping out of prison for things you haven't
[2:11:41.360 --> 2:11:47.280]  done but yeah they've been breathing down my neck and i don't say that to go oh look i'm under attack
[2:11:47.280 --> 2:11:53.280]  you can turn the news on and see that i say that to say i'm innocent everyone knows i'm innocent
[2:11:53.280 --> 2:11:58.320]  i have nothing to do with the russians the russians are incompetent running their own country just
[2:11:58.320 --> 2:12:04.960]  like we are in many respects they're it's a canard it's a red herring the problem is the out of
[2:12:04.960 --> 2:12:09.360]  control bureaucracy that we face all right for the rest of the hour that i'm going to host some of
[2:12:09.360 --> 2:12:15.360]  the fourth hour and cover all the other news sticks joins us and i've been watching this guy for six
[2:12:15.360 --> 2:12:22.000]  seven eight years on youtube he's got billions of views racked up there it's an author editor
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:28.720]  video creator and gardener and he goes by stick six six six official and uh i think that's
[2:12:29.600 --> 2:12:34.640]  you know just more of an obnoxious handle but he could describe that for you if he wishes
[2:12:34.640 --> 2:12:38.160]  fact even if he was a devil or his personal thing he is at least he comes on the show
[2:12:38.160 --> 2:12:41.520]  no other leftist will even come on the show i don't want to describe him as a leftist maybe an
[2:12:41.520 --> 2:12:47.440]  anarchic capitalist i'm not sure maybe he should describe himself for us uh but he joins us now
[2:12:47.440 --> 2:12:51.840]  because i want to just get him on he's gone with paul before and paul's hosted just to give his
[2:12:51.840 --> 2:12:57.520]  commentary on where we are because i don't want to overdo this but let me tell you epstein was a
[2:12:57.520 --> 2:13:03.040]  big wake up the russia gate falling apart was a big wake up this roger stone thing i had people at
[2:13:03.040 --> 2:13:08.800]  the grocery store last night this morning getting gas just running up you're going uh i'm wrong you're
[2:13:08.800 --> 2:13:13.920]  right roger and you were interested i used to be a liberal i'm an idiot i i mean this is big this is
[2:13:13.920 --> 2:13:20.560]  big and the calls and the end to the office and everything i think people really are waking up
[2:13:20.560 --> 2:13:26.400]  right now maybe i'm wrong uh but something big is going on sticks thanks for coming on with us
[2:13:26.400 --> 2:13:30.400]  how would you describe yourself for new viewers or people that don't know who you are sort of others
[2:13:30.400 --> 2:13:34.720]  defining you some of your tongue and cheek stuff and then what would you call the age we're in right
[2:13:34.720 --> 2:13:40.720]  now i would call it a little bit of a dark age but it's almost a little bit of a golden age as
[2:13:40.720 --> 2:13:45.040]  well because we have the trump president so we have a booming economy there are plenty of things
[2:13:45.040 --> 2:13:51.280]  that are improving my own views they've shifted a little bit over the time but pretty much remained
[2:13:51.280 --> 2:13:57.600]  the same which is i was a liberal in the classical sense many many years ago i'm a libertarian self
[2:13:57.600 --> 2:14:02.160]  professed uh there are some populistic beliefs that i hold and then there are some beliefs that
[2:14:02.160 --> 2:14:07.360]  are more liberal still definitely in form and i think you probably fit into the same broad category
[2:14:07.360 --> 2:14:12.160]  which is a person who can't be cookie-cuttered into the same sort of like little categories that
[2:14:12.160 --> 2:14:16.800]  the establishment really wants to put people in because it helps to control them precisely i don't
[2:14:16.800 --> 2:14:22.960]  want to be put in exactly yeah exactly as far as the username goes that actually dates back many
[2:14:22.960 --> 2:14:29.600]  many years to when i was actually an atheistic satanist i left that behind long ago i have
[2:14:29.600 --> 2:14:34.320]  nothing to do with it anymore but the name stuck so i just kept it the same sure it makes sense
[2:14:35.120 --> 2:14:40.480]  so so what would you what would you what's your prediction on what the left's gonna do now because
[2:14:40.480 --> 2:14:46.400]  they're clearly self-destructing yeah they're just just completely blowing themselves up i mean look
[2:14:46.400 --> 2:14:52.000]  bernie sanders was considered really far out in 2016 now his little revolution schtick is getting
[2:14:52.000 --> 2:14:58.560]  old because there are people that are more extreme than he is booty judge on certain issues certainly
[2:14:58.560 --> 2:15:03.760]  bloomberg on guns probably the most far out person we can possibly think of i mean as as one of
[2:15:03.760 --> 2:15:09.280]  bernie sanders constituents i'm actually from vermont which some people don't know bernie sanders
[2:15:09.280 --> 2:15:13.600]  has been doing the tired hack thing for a very very long time he's literally been in politics
[2:15:13.600 --> 2:15:22.480]  since the carter administration and everything he touches he swendles yeah exactly he's a he's
[2:15:22.480 --> 2:15:27.040]  a little bit of a snake oil salesman ultimately i've got a lot of questions we're going to break
[2:15:27.040 --> 2:15:32.080]  it 20 seconds what do you want to cover when we come back we can talk anything politics a little
[2:15:32.080 --> 2:15:36.720]  bit of coronavirus maybe in the weakness of the democratic field definitely would be like the issue

[2:20:19.120 --> 2:20:24.000]  a little bit of fun here folks sticks a very popular author researcher on youtube and other
[2:20:24.000 --> 2:20:29.360]  platforms to share with us and i wanted to get him on because i watch a lot of his videos he has
[2:20:29.360 --> 2:20:34.640]  really intelligent insights and makes me have original thoughts which i don't have a lot actually
[2:20:34.640 --> 2:20:38.960]  listen to other people i don't want to get too confident here though because there's a lot of
[2:20:38.960 --> 2:20:43.440]  big problems you're right it's like the calla yuga if you believe the hindu is the end of this big
[2:20:43.440 --> 2:20:48.800]  dark age but at the end of the night you kind of see the sun rising off the distance at least
[2:20:48.800 --> 2:20:54.400]  you know high up in the clouds before it even comes up over the horizon you see those first rays
[2:20:55.920 --> 2:21:00.640]  the left the globalist everywhere screwing the pooch and people are waking up to them but there
[2:21:00.640 --> 2:21:08.000]  is that paradoxical view how would you describe the time we're alive right now and the microcosm
[2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:12.320]  of the democrats in iowa and everywhere else and what they're doing and where where you see all
[2:21:12.320 --> 2:21:18.480]  this going because i don't want to be overconfident watching them destroy themselves and then i ask
[2:21:18.480 --> 2:21:23.360]  how are they going to strike back what are they going to pull next yeah being overconfidence
[2:21:23.360 --> 2:21:28.640]  never good but ultimately i remain largely optimistic i choose to believe that the average
[2:21:28.640 --> 2:21:34.480]  person in the world is fundamentally good and capable of governing their affairs and and understands
[2:21:34.480 --> 2:21:39.040]  that corruption isn't a good thing i like to believe that if they're presented with accurate
[2:21:39.040 --> 2:21:46.080]  information which is what you are invested in myself and many others if they have the information
[2:21:46.080 --> 2:21:52.160]  real true information on things they will generally make decent decisions what sets that sort of
[2:21:52.160 --> 2:21:56.480]  mentality apart from what we see among the democrats is they don't believe in individuality
[2:21:56.480 --> 2:22:01.360]  in any real sense at this point they've they've gone completely off kilter they don't even know
[2:22:01.360 --> 2:22:05.280]  what they're talking about but i don't think that there are classical death cult now really aren't
[2:22:05.280 --> 2:22:10.480]  they a classical death cult yeah yeah and some in some respects absolutely i think that trump is
[2:22:10.480 --> 2:22:14.960]  likely to win reelection and i know trump's not perfect by any means he's been a moderate
[2:22:14.960 --> 2:22:20.320]  reformer but he's trying and he is reforming things as opposed to the democrats that nothing
[2:22:20.320 --> 2:22:25.920]  says that the the best answer to donald trump right now that they seem to have is a dude who's
[2:22:25.920 --> 2:22:30.720]  older than trump richer ironically uh and a thousand times more corrupt than anything
[2:22:30.720 --> 2:22:35.440]  trump could ever concoct which is michael bloomberg it looks like he might end up being their nominee
[2:22:35.440 --> 2:22:41.280]  inexplicably and not even a real dollar that made is 78 million off of rig stock market stuff
[2:22:41.280 --> 2:22:46.160]  yeah and he's not even on the ballot i think until super tuesday or until at least if i remember
[2:22:46.160 --> 2:22:50.640]  correctly south carolina he hasn't even gotten a delegate because he wasn't even on the ballot
[2:22:50.640 --> 2:22:55.680]  before and yet he's arguably that their mainline frontrunner now now that biden's basically croaked
[2:22:55.680 --> 2:23:05.840]  politically wow why did they try to force feed biden he was so obviously even six months ago
[2:23:05.840 --> 2:23:11.920]  couldn't even put a sentence together yeah and initially i figured that the basic idea of the
[2:23:11.920 --> 2:23:17.280]  dnc at first i figured they wanted biden just because he's easily controlled he's pretty he's
[2:23:17.280 --> 2:23:21.280]  predictable he's already been in the white house so he's obviously an establishment terrian in that
[2:23:21.280 --> 2:23:26.800]  sense i figured that elizabeth warren was sort of their draw their secondary so that if he ever
[2:23:26.800 --> 2:23:32.560]  faltered she would get the backing but now looks like michael bloomberg may have even uh ironically
[2:23:32.560 --> 2:23:37.680]  enough he may have outmaneuvered the dnc because they basically have a steward leader they don't
[2:23:37.680 --> 2:23:43.280]  they're a party without a king their figurehead leader is tom perez he's back in the shadows he
[2:23:43.280 --> 2:23:48.960]  never even makes public appearances or statements at the time polosi becomes their spiritual advisor
[2:23:48.960 --> 2:23:54.640]  think of that as as the insanity the total lunacy that it has to be and then they've got people like
[2:23:54.640 --> 2:23:58.880]  hillary clinton who are blind egotists each one wants to lead the party but they just end up
[2:23:58.880 --> 2:24:04.640]  stabbing each other in the back and then sanders arrives and he's even crazier than he was before
[2:24:04.640 --> 2:24:10.400]  oddly enough though this time he almost gets edged out because other people have taken aspects of
[2:24:10.400 --> 2:24:16.000]  far leftism cannibalize them like warren with his entire platform and actually made them even worse
[2:24:16.000 --> 2:24:22.320]  than the socialism he pedaled all along and i'm sure you've seen the footage of warren in in new
[2:24:22.320 --> 2:24:28.320]  hampshire i mean no one wants to talk to her and she and it's not she's this creepy looking lady man
[2:24:28.960 --> 2:24:34.240]  i mean these are creepers yeah she i thought it was bad when she came in a fairly distant third
[2:24:34.240 --> 2:24:38.240]  in iowitz like well you know basically you're you're the third wheel candidate she can't even
[2:24:38.240 --> 2:24:44.240]  do that in new hampshire in new hampshire she was ahead a few months prior she was number one in a
[2:24:44.240 --> 2:24:50.160]  couple of polls she was actually the front one runner in a few polls booty judge and and sanders
[2:24:50.160 --> 2:24:55.920]  end up claiming the victory klobuchar comes out of nowhere which i don't think anyone really expected
[2:24:55.920 --> 2:25:00.960]  uh not that she's not that she's viable long term it'd be very funny if klobuchar and warren
[2:25:00.960 --> 2:25:05.440]  ended up fighting over the same sort of identity politics block and that's possible too and that
[2:25:05.440 --> 2:25:10.640]  would make it a much more exciting race that's right she attacked joe biden and said he hated
[2:25:10.640 --> 2:25:15.200]  women and all this stuff and then she was given a speech last time of you go saying we need to
[2:25:15.200 --> 2:25:19.680]  stop in fighting and the democratic party and destroying ourselves from within it's like
[2:25:19.680 --> 2:25:25.840]  whatever the inversion of reality is they do it and they don't think people see it well the problem
[2:25:25.840 --> 2:25:31.200]  is they've gotten themselves addicted to the heroine of tabloidism so they've become the sensationalist
[2:25:31.200 --> 2:25:36.640]  now and the thing is that they try to blame trump and say well everything was all normal and all
[2:25:36.640 --> 2:25:41.680]  this stuff was only in the weekly world news but then trump is mainstreaming conspiracy theories
[2:25:41.680 --> 2:25:46.480]  and stuff the democrats have spent the last few years trying to tell us that our political system
[2:25:46.480 --> 2:25:52.320]  is being usurped by boris and natalia uh that the pink panthers wandering around and things
[2:25:52.320 --> 2:25:57.200]  like that they're living in a la la land and this is why by the way bernie sanders could end up
[2:25:57.200 --> 2:26:01.360]  doing it because if you've got a group of lunatics trying to vote on which lunatic to lead them off
[2:26:01.360 --> 2:26:07.440]  the cliff well it's a natural choice would be bernie sanders he's been doing it since the 1970s
[2:26:07.440 --> 2:26:12.160]  he's the thoroughbred of it and you're right they don't get they've put themselves in their own
[2:26:12.160 --> 2:26:17.520]  alternate phantom zone universe they keep saying that libertarians nationalists patriots common
[2:26:17.520 --> 2:26:22.240]  censors that we're in echo chamber we're out in the real world i want to know what the public thinks
[2:26:22.240 --> 2:26:28.000]  they literally should have focused group saying that a populist movement was run by the russians
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:34.240]  no one buys that crap yeah trump was never an extremist or fanatic anyway the people who call
[2:26:34.240 --> 2:26:39.200]  them a fanatic a fanatic or people who wear che guvara shirts and think that the ussr is a good
[2:26:39.200 --> 2:26:46.240]  honeymoon location if you think that way you genuinely believe that you know whatever then
[2:26:46.240 --> 2:26:51.920]  yeah trump begins to look extreme but really what's he arguing for we staff our borders well that's
[2:26:51.920 --> 2:26:56.080]  something that every president since reagan has been promising he's the only one to partially
[2:26:56.080 --> 2:27:01.920]  fulfill that and that's something any viable country does exactly every other country does that uh
[2:27:01.920 --> 2:27:07.520]  tax relief which which you know mainly affected the middle and working class as far as a ratio of
[2:27:07.520 --> 2:27:12.720]  tax relief to the amount actually earned he's been a reformist president he hasn't done anything
[2:27:12.720 --> 2:27:18.560]  yes he raised taxes on me who they call a rich guy the taxes on people that actually actually went
[2:27:18.560 --> 2:27:24.160]  up it only the cut was only for middle class and working class well the democrats would definitely
[2:27:24.160 --> 2:27:28.800]  raise it more because you know you see you you don't bribe senators so it becomes a big problem if
[2:27:28.800 --> 2:27:32.720]  you're like bloomberg though they're not going to touch your money oh he pays nothing because because
[2:27:32.720 --> 2:27:38.480]  they write the laws at just like bezos pays no tax and then lectures everyone on the middle class
[2:27:38.480 --> 2:27:43.840]  is it paying enough all day long yeah yeah it's it's insane to actually see what some of these
[2:27:43.840 --> 2:27:49.600]  proposals are and then the real kicker this is the funny part like if you go around twitter and stuff
[2:27:49.600 --> 2:27:54.160]  you'll see bernie sanders fans especially pretending that he's not a socialist their new
[2:27:54.160 --> 2:27:59.040]  thing is they're scared that the label socialism is turning off independent voters so they say no
[2:27:59.040 --> 2:28:03.600]  no no he's not actually a socialist he's a social democrat and then when you confront them with
[2:28:03.600 --> 2:28:09.040]  footage of sanders calling himself a socialist they say well he's just wrong he's wrong about his own
[2:28:09.040 --> 2:28:15.200]  ideology he's been lying since the 1970s and he's not actually a one true socialist it's a total
[2:28:15.200 --> 2:28:19.360]  fallacy and it's the funniest thing i've ever seen in my life and the praising of it as well you
[2:28:19.360 --> 2:28:25.280]  know like you said the problem is 18 types of deodorant i mean we just we just it was sticks

[2:33:44.320 --> 2:33:50.000]  things but want to make sure it's not a dead cat bounce when we have the democratic party and big
[2:33:50.000 --> 2:33:57.360]  foundations in europe teaching inherently that white people are bad obviously that's meant to invoke
[2:33:57.360 --> 2:34:03.200]  racial division just like a warden in a prison wants to control things by race and these videos
[2:34:03.200 --> 2:34:09.600]  come out almost daily and i don't normally get to them but this is a university of virginia
[2:34:11.200 --> 2:34:16.000]  with a woman coming to the new diversity campus area you've probably already seen it and saying
[2:34:17.200 --> 2:34:21.680]  white people there's too many of you need to leave well this isn't a fake video they confirm
[2:34:21.680 --> 2:34:28.320]  it's real this is what goes on now what it really is is like catty shack elitism judge smell saying
[2:34:28.320 --> 2:34:32.960]  you're not welcome here at the golf course this is what tribalism is is an elitism but if you're
[2:34:32.960 --> 2:34:37.040]  part of the university you're there you're enrolled you're paying money you have a right whether you're
[2:34:37.040 --> 2:34:42.080]  black or white or whatever you go anywhere but the fact that the left hasn't just abandoned
[2:34:42.640 --> 2:34:48.560]  common sense uh american reforms but has inverted them and then claims the moral high ground
[2:34:49.120 --> 2:34:53.600]  boggles the mind and but they're doing it because they believe this is the venom that will bring us
[2:34:53.600 --> 2:35:03.120]  down here's the club public service announcement excuse me if y'all didn't know this is the msc
[2:35:03.120 --> 2:35:07.840]  and frankly there's just too many white people in here and this is a space for people of color
[2:35:07.840 --> 2:35:12.000]  so just be really cognizant of the space that you're taking up because it does
[2:35:12.000 --> 2:35:16.560]  make some of us pocs uncomfortable when we see too many white people in here it's only been open
[2:35:16.560 --> 2:35:21.680]  for four days and frankly there's the whole university for a lot of y'all to be at and
[2:35:21.680 --> 2:35:30.080]  there's very few spaces for us so keep that in mind thank you and then everyone like cult members
[2:35:30.080 --> 2:35:35.520]  because that's what it is virtue signals that they agree with it i mean you could talk for
[2:35:35.520 --> 2:35:42.000]  hundred hours i'm sure just about that clip that is not isolated yeah now there's definitely a lot
[2:35:42.000 --> 2:35:46.320]  of that going on one thing i'd point out though is that this is this is a far left university and
[2:35:46.320 --> 2:35:51.760]  this is the multiculturalism sort of student resource thing the people that are going to be there
[2:35:51.760 --> 2:35:56.640]  are going to cheer for that sort of racism and that's really what it is and and they're also the same
[2:35:56.640 --> 2:36:02.080]  small but very very vocal and sometimes quite violent minority of people who have no problem
[2:36:02.080 --> 2:36:08.720]  with with becoming violent and who also would say uh that like like only whites can be racist
[2:36:08.720 --> 2:36:14.160]  and we've here we've heard that before it's often within an academic setting i would say the average
[2:36:14.160 --> 2:36:18.400]  even left-wing politician probably privately disagrees with that they're just willing to
[2:36:18.400 --> 2:36:22.560]  use it as political fodder one thing though i would i would ask somebody like that imagine
[2:36:22.560 --> 2:36:27.920]  that someone comes in like there's a mixed race couple uh where you've got like like some black
[2:36:27.920 --> 2:36:32.960]  person dating a white person which would she say therefore that you know they have to say bye bye
[2:36:32.960 --> 2:36:38.160]  their loved one well there's the the naked and hideous racism of it they wouldn't want to answer
[2:36:38.160 --> 2:36:44.560]  that question now would they it's just total gangster thugism like you talk about nazis
[2:36:44.560 --> 2:36:49.200]  the closest thing the nazis i've ever seen is the left saying not just these you know evergreen
[2:36:49.200 --> 2:36:56.080]  and so many others whites aren't allowed here this weekend it's it's just obnoxious well they're
[2:36:56.080 --> 2:37:00.640]  also the book burners you see what they're trying to do on the internet all too well with with not
[2:37:00.640 --> 2:37:05.760]  just yourself but many other people getting completely banned off of mainline tech platforms
[2:37:05.760 --> 2:37:10.640]  that should be functioning legally as platforms because they platform government services like
[2:37:10.640 --> 2:37:17.600]  the usgs or no a a in so far as their taxpayer funded for for us citizens in us firms it should
[2:37:17.600 --> 2:37:22.080]  all be equal but they want to they want to burn books in the literal sense they've even gone
[2:37:22.080 --> 2:37:28.400]  after amazon titles they want to ban people from public events based on their race based on their
[2:37:28.400 --> 2:37:34.400]  sexage and so forth um at what point are we going to point out who's actually acting in a bigoted
[2:37:34.400 --> 2:37:41.440]  and uninclusive manner it's the same people that ramble always about inclusivity because their whole
[2:37:41.440 --> 2:37:46.080]  world is about what color you are instead of what you actually stand for and that's what's so dangerous
[2:37:46.080 --> 2:37:51.520]  in in in fact you mentioned that let's criticize trump at least i am his head justice department
[2:37:51.520 --> 2:37:55.520]  lawyer came out in a hollywood reporter article yesterday and said we're not going to go after
[2:37:55.520 --> 2:38:00.240]  big tech it's their speech they can control speeches they want but as you said section 230
[2:38:00.240 --> 2:38:06.560]  their utility and to be watching us in lifetime is a is surveillance and it's really election
[2:38:06.560 --> 2:38:12.480]  meddling so i see trump's biggest failing so far other than not hardening assange who he told
[2:38:12.480 --> 2:38:18.000]  release the wiki leagues is not standing up to this this is far beyond what private companies
[2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:24.080]  are doing it's organized admitted coordinated suppression of communications that that's so
[2:38:24.080 --> 2:38:30.080]  dangerous i would agree and that's exactly why i support alt-tech and by the way congratulations
[2:38:30.080 --> 2:38:35.600]  i believe info war is now approaching 63 000 subscribers on bit shoot yes which is quite
[2:38:35.600 --> 2:38:40.400]  you know that this this is the sort of numbers that were unimaginable on some of these platforms
[2:38:40.400 --> 2:38:46.160]  even a couple of years ago we had vid me we had other sites try to be competitors to sites like
[2:38:46.160 --> 2:38:52.160]  youtube or let's remember the big techs constantly going after bit shoot constantly after gab
[2:38:52.160 --> 2:38:57.680]  constantly trying to shut down any new platform going after their banking going after our banking
[2:38:57.680 --> 2:39:02.240]  while they say oh just build your own thing we do build our own thing and they come after us
[2:39:03.120 --> 2:39:07.280]  yeah well eventually you'll build enough things that they won't be able to come after you it'll
[2:39:07.280 --> 2:39:13.040]  be just like the really early wave of the internet getting supplanted by these companies they've become
[2:39:13.040 --> 2:39:20.240]  hegemonically powerful at the moment but they can be supplanted um my main worry is right if the
[2:39:20.240 --> 2:39:25.840]  people go patronize and just so just watch other people's platforms it will move the power away
[2:39:25.840 --> 2:39:31.360]  from the system well also these sites were formed by people that were edgy and taboo and swore a lot
[2:39:31.360 --> 2:39:36.480]  and did like all sorts of weird off the wall and sometimes violent fanatic things so wherever that
[2:39:36.480 --> 2:39:42.000]  sort of crowd gravitates towards is going to grow and alt-tech despite the fact that it that the
[2:39:42.000 --> 2:39:46.720]  reputation is partially unearned because there's a lot of commentary like yours or mine there that's
[2:39:46.720 --> 2:39:52.400]  not fanatic that's not violent where that sort of stuff is tends to be especially where younger
[2:39:52.400 --> 2:39:56.720]  audiences will gravitate towards and when they're trying to sanitize the internet my goodness what
[2:39:56.720 --> 2:40:02.800]  an impossible task because new sites will just crop up anytime one you're right they are absolutely
[2:40:02.800 --> 2:40:09.920]  following the one course that could extinct their hegemonic power exactly and and i think part of
[2:40:09.920 --> 2:40:15.040]  me is sad about that because for many years i was just a youtuber i don't want to see it go the way
[2:40:15.040 --> 2:40:20.160]  of the dinosaur i just totally agree why are they doing this why are they doing this if the
[2:40:20.160 --> 2:40:25.920]  internet would be perfect if they had just frozen time at 2016 and not gone any further and just
[2:40:25.920 --> 2:40:30.400]  ignored all of these censorship lovers who at the end of the day it's all about money it has nothing
[2:40:30.400 --> 2:40:35.600]  to do with your you're right you know as soon as they gave in the censorship now sasha barrick
[2:40:35.600 --> 2:40:43.120]  cohen is on cnn saying execute arrest and put in prison mark zuckerberg as he hasn't bowed enough
[2:40:43.120 --> 2:40:49.520]  don't they get like once you give up the free speech defense it's all over yeah and and these
[2:40:49.520 --> 2:40:54.160]  people want money initially they held corporate money advertiser money over the heads of youtube
[2:40:54.160 --> 2:40:58.720]  and zuckerberg and they all they all took the bait and they all started bowing down before
[2:40:58.720 --> 2:41:02.960]  censorship and now they realize they're screwed and now they have to fight back against the same
[2:41:02.960 --> 2:41:08.400]  group of people they were working with before i almost have to feel sorry for some of these people
[2:41:08.400 --> 2:41:12.560]  it's like they should have known better and they didn't and now alt tech comes along to kick them in
[2:41:12.560 --> 2:41:19.600]  the butt and then what about sasha barrick cohen makes all his money on super edgy comedy and now he
[2:41:19.600 --> 2:41:24.800]  suddenly says let's arrest people we disagree with he looks like count Dracula or something i mean
[2:41:24.800 --> 2:41:30.800]  it's sick how far the mighty have fallen i seem to remember that his main claim to fame post movies
[2:41:30.800 --> 2:41:35.280]  was dressing up as bruno and descending from the what was it during the oscars or emmies are selling
[2:41:35.280 --> 2:41:40.880]  from the ceiling landing face first in m&m's lap and i guess he was in on the joke that's like two
[2:41:40.880 --> 2:41:46.960]  of the biggest shock jocks of their era uh teaming up for this and then they've both gone completely
[2:41:46.960 --> 2:41:52.800]  soft m&m has to it's sold out it's it's really obnoxious because it'd be one thing if he hadn't
[2:41:52.800 --> 2:41:59.360]  been mr free speech but now he's like the darth vader of anti-free speech it's disgusting yeah
[2:41:59.360 --> 2:42:03.520]  and bruno and borat were both great movies and now it's like what's he done lately he tried with
[2:42:03.520 --> 2:42:09.600]  the dictator and it was all scripted nobody liked it well that said he did that uh cable show where
[2:42:09.600 --> 2:42:16.480]  he bashed free speech and nobody liked it it's like yeah dude people don't like jerks if he had
[2:42:16.480 --> 2:42:20.800]  just remained edgy he'd probably still be making some good stuff too he could put it just on the
[2:42:20.800 --> 2:42:25.040]  internet just on all tech make it a bit chute exclusive or a library exclusive so what happened
[2:42:25.040 --> 2:42:29.760]  he started taking himself too seriously or what yeah that's what i think a lot of these people
[2:42:29.760 --> 2:42:34.080]  they get successful and that's exactly what they do and thank goodness you haven't and others haven't
[2:42:34.080 --> 2:42:41.440]  no i take myself a lot less seriously now i'd go crazy these people man that's the nothing
[2:42:41.440 --> 2:42:45.840]  against old people but taking yourself too seriously is the biggest sign of dementia there is
[2:42:45.840 --> 2:42:48.160]  we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen stay with us
[2:42:54.640 --> 2:43:01.440]  this should really be easier than it is i'm not here giving you a sales pitch i'm pointing out

[2:47:45.200 --> 2:47:48.400]  i'm gonna start the next hour take your calls i've been holding pace with me i really appreciate
[2:47:48.400 --> 2:47:53.520]  you and then mad bracken takes over i don't want to be overconfident here so i keep going back to
[2:47:53.520 --> 2:48:03.840]  this point how does trump screw the pooch how does he let these people win we know there's
[2:48:03.840 --> 2:48:08.800]  election fraud we know they've got illegal aliens being registered to vote everywhere and again i
[2:48:08.800 --> 2:48:12.080]  don't just hit us a virtue signal i'm not against people that want to come here and have a better
[2:48:12.080 --> 2:48:17.440]  life but they're being used as a political tool the democrats admit they're betting on them they
[2:48:17.440 --> 2:48:22.400]  control them they almost all vote for democrats because they bring them in we have to oppose it so
[2:48:23.520 --> 2:48:27.680]  we've seen so many of their attacks fail i don't want to be overconfident
[2:48:30.640 --> 2:48:35.360]  like so many people we've seen and i already said this to you three times sticks but i go back to
[2:48:35.360 --> 2:48:42.560]  this how does trump lose because by talking about how trump loses we started talking about
[2:48:42.560 --> 2:48:48.160]  how we win and how he wins because i know the white house listens i know trump listens what is
[2:48:48.160 --> 2:48:55.600]  trump's chinks in the armor what like schmog what scales is he missing on his belly well considering
[2:48:55.600 --> 2:49:01.120]  his approval rate within the republican core and among f the state of the union as well i think
[2:49:01.120 --> 2:49:07.520]  increasingly independent voters the chance really is not that high i think of failure there's an
[2:49:07.520 --> 2:49:14.240]  outside chance for a few of the candidates but the thing is the democratic primaries are lean
[2:49:14.240 --> 2:49:19.600]  so heavily to the left that it's it's so totally different than the general election that my guess
[2:49:19.600 --> 2:49:24.640]  is that probably they're going to nominate someone who's either extremely far left and unpalatable
[2:49:24.640 --> 2:49:29.120]  to the average voter which would be sanders generally speaking or somebody like bloomberg
[2:49:29.920 --> 2:49:36.320]  somebody who who can't really capture the far left thing because the rest of the party has gone so
[2:49:36.320 --> 2:49:41.920]  far left i think that barring health problems which is always a possibility we have to keep that in
[2:49:41.920 --> 2:49:47.520]  mind 73 or something yeah i mean i mean trump's not exactly a spring chicken but barring health
[2:49:47.520 --> 2:49:52.320]  problems and he seems to be in reasonably good health and and half the demfield is older anyway
[2:49:52.320 --> 2:49:56.640]  that and their nominee you know is likely to be older unless it's booty judge in which case he's
[2:49:56.640 --> 2:50:02.160]  likely to be not even middle aged yet not that much older than i am i think that trump's pretty
[2:50:02.160 --> 2:50:07.760]  much got it in the bag actually a bad economy could sink his his presidential chances but so many
[2:50:07.760 --> 2:50:13.680]  what i haven't gotten to yet your view on the coronavirus yeah i think the coronavirus could
[2:50:13.680 --> 2:50:18.240]  potentially cause economic problems maybe not on the order that would stop trump's reelection
[2:50:19.120 --> 2:50:24.240]  i do see it becoming a problem i've been advising people now for several weeks on every video update
[2:50:24.240 --> 2:50:30.400]  i do now is the time to do some basic preparations getting some a few weeks worth at least of food
[2:50:30.400 --> 2:50:35.840]  per person purified water iodized salt and other things you might need not because of coronavirus
[2:50:35.840 --> 2:50:40.240]  itself because the average person that gets it they get better a few weeks later they feel fine
[2:50:40.240 --> 2:50:45.200]  but because panic can set and we've seen this in muhan we've seen it in singapore we've seen it in
[2:50:45.200 --> 2:50:50.400]  other parts of asia that the virus gets near a community and all of a sudden the shelves are
[2:50:50.400 --> 2:50:56.720]  bare well if you already only had a few days left of food and there's no food to be had unless you
[2:50:56.720 --> 2:51:01.680]  intend to go bake borrow and steal and go out you know potentially get infected by the way by being
[2:51:01.680 --> 2:51:07.200]  in public anyway you you might be tough out of luck you might have some problems so it makes
[2:51:07.200 --> 2:51:12.880]  sense to have some you know just basically rice and beans can soup and a can opener something basic
[2:51:12.880 --> 2:51:19.760]  that you can survive off of for a few weeks at a time at least all right so we looked at i totally
[2:51:19.760 --> 2:51:25.200]  agree with what you're saying we looked at how trump could externally be defeated but isn't it
[2:51:25.200 --> 2:51:31.040]  really his advisors and if he goes the same around as trusting establishment people who lie to his
[2:51:31.040 --> 2:51:36.400]  face that that the biggest threat is if trump isn't faithful and if trump doesn't do the right thing
[2:51:36.400 --> 2:51:41.200]  i i think that's the big issue for me and how do we have if you agree with me sticks how do we
[2:51:41.200 --> 2:51:45.760]  then keep trump faithful how do we get him to finally do something about the suppression of
[2:51:45.760 --> 2:51:50.240]  speech the racketeering all these unamerican things because i don't want to be so in love with
[2:51:50.240 --> 2:51:55.520]  trump because i want to be clear to everybody i've been persecuted for supporting trump okay i get
[2:51:55.520 --> 2:51:59.520]  attacked for supporting him i'm not going to attack him now because i want to get brownie points
[2:51:59.520 --> 2:52:03.840]  i'm doing it because i want him to really do the right thing i don't want to just go oh
[2:52:03.840 --> 2:52:07.680]  he's not hillary or he's not sanders so i'm going to bend over to what trump's doing
[2:52:08.320 --> 2:52:14.560]  isn't trump trump's own worst enemy and how do we keep him honest yeah i think and you pointed
[2:52:14.560 --> 2:52:18.800]  it out in the previous segment something that's very important which is that perhaps his biggest
[2:52:18.800 --> 2:52:24.320]  failing so far has been an in an unwillingness or an inability to address online censorship
[2:52:24.320 --> 2:52:29.200]  especially but censorship in a more general sense he's delegated it largely to his son
[2:52:29.200 --> 2:52:35.360]  to don jr who weighs in on it and that's fine and and i i do speculate that censorship we don't
[2:52:35.360 --> 2:52:41.920]  want to bone we don't want to bone we don't want to talk exactly he needs to take action on that
[2:52:41.920 --> 2:52:47.520]  that is important um i i would say that is definitely one of his bigger failings organically
[2:52:47.520 --> 2:52:52.640]  censorship it looks like it will be on the skids but that could be a big problem for trump other
[2:52:52.640 --> 2:52:58.400]  than the economy but pissing off his core fans with not tackling that issue is a problem because
[2:52:58.400 --> 2:53:03.520]  people have people who make they're living online especially in parter and hole have a
[2:53:03.520 --> 2:53:08.640]  lopsided control really over information's experiences being shadow bander blocked because
[2:53:08.640 --> 2:53:15.280]  they put out a trump meme i mean people physically get like they're being screwed here and and even
[2:53:15.280 --> 2:53:20.720]  even different from that is for every creator that's banned they've got thousands or maybe even
[2:53:20.720 --> 2:53:25.680]  millions of fans that suffer as the result of that that's by the way why censorship i think
[2:53:25.680 --> 2:53:30.160]  is already losing favor i've seen people on the far left now calling out some of the corporate
[2:53:30.160 --> 2:53:34.960]  censorship which is to their credit uh they're still far left obviously because you got your
[2:53:34.960 --> 2:53:41.520]  finger on the pulse everybody knows that you talked a lot of folks i agree i'm seeing i'm seeing
[2:53:41.520 --> 2:53:49.440]  a major rejection of the censorship what quantify that for folks yeah well what's happened is and
[2:53:49.440 --> 2:53:54.400]  this was even last year they banned a whole bunch of progressive pages actually on facebook for
[2:53:54.400 --> 2:53:59.360]  botting and things of that nature now the far left is not organically as popular so they usually do
[2:53:59.360 --> 2:54:04.480]  things like that but people who were organically part of that got pissed off anyway i remember
[2:54:04.480 --> 2:54:09.840]  what was the page caught block got banned among others for doxing and some other practices and
[2:54:09.840 --> 2:54:15.840]  this has been cross platform as well i see a moment coming in which elements of the left team up with
[2:54:15.840 --> 2:54:21.280]  the broader right and of course more libertarian segment of society to defeat tech censorship
[2:54:21.280 --> 2:54:26.720]  and part of that will be all tech simply by putting pressure on the mainline sites as well
[2:54:26.720 --> 2:54:32.080]  well whatever tech company submits to the crowd's vision will will dominate the planet
[2:54:32.080 --> 2:54:36.240]  which they don't get like you want to worry about who's going to take over the tech company that
[2:54:36.240 --> 2:54:42.320]  empowers the people and gets behind them a hundred percent the will of humanity is so powerful that
[2:54:42.320 --> 2:54:48.000]  that company could get total dominance in just a year supporting speech and they just don't even
[2:54:48.000 --> 2:54:53.840]  get it i mean i mean take mclatchy they do a lot of great work they are their bankrupt they're
[2:54:53.840 --> 2:55:00.800]  shutting down they supported censorship so they got rid of themselves like idiots in the last two
[2:55:00.800 --> 2:55:04.960]  years and now they made themselves obsolete i'm not happy about that i don't think of things
[2:55:04.960 --> 2:55:11.280]  like well if i survive the censorship i'll be dominant later that is just mackie of alien
[2:55:11.280 --> 2:55:18.640]  psychotic bs well it's been other legacy media firms have had the same problem which is that
[2:55:18.640 --> 2:55:24.800]  i think new york times is downsized wapo i think downsized vox and some of these others a lot of
[2:55:24.800 --> 2:55:29.600]  these groups have already lost a significant amount of their audience because they're all
[2:55:29.600 --> 2:55:34.720]  imploding they're all imploding yeah because they support censorship and they don't realize
[2:55:34.720 --> 2:55:43.120]  eventually it can be aimed at them too so what so gut level then uh sticks how do you see this
[2:55:43.120 --> 2:55:51.360]  ending i mean just in the midterm as far as the election just all of it like what the left's done
[2:55:51.360 --> 2:55:56.480]  and what they've turned into and just it's just like they're so villainous i can't even describe
[2:55:56.480 --> 2:56:01.200]  that i'm like you guys are so evil i can't even like talk about how bad you are it's like it's
[2:56:01.200 --> 2:56:07.760]  ridiculous i think that they probably lose 2020 and possibly the house in the process
[2:56:07.760 --> 2:56:12.080]  and that one that what ends up happening is their their party crashes and burns the party
[2:56:12.080 --> 2:56:17.920]  leadership is largely ousted one of two things that happens the liberal core which most of these
[2:56:17.920 --> 2:56:22.960]  people are saying and we can you know talk about their individual sort of belief systems a little
[2:56:22.960 --> 2:56:27.760]  bit more maybe some time i think they either partner with the far left and they become a
[2:56:27.760 --> 2:56:32.240]  socialist movement which of course would mean they'd lose in the future or i think they eject
[2:56:32.240 --> 2:56:36.960]  the socialists like the aoc crowd the bernie sanders nuts then they end up re embracing the
[2:56:36.960 --> 2:56:41.360]  business democrats that they've been losing to trump that's why they lost the rust belt and it's
[2:56:41.360 --> 2:56:47.600]  why they're behind in a lot of these states now yeah that's it and it's just an insane time to be
[2:56:47.600 --> 2:56:54.720]  alive and to watch this madness because if they radicalize even more though in closing
[2:56:54.720 --> 2:57:02.240]  if they even get more radical what happens well then then 99% of people think they're absolutely
[2:57:02.240 --> 2:57:10.560]  nuts instead of just 90% of people so they're extincting themselves yeah i think that the
[2:57:10.560 --> 2:57:15.440]  democrats have a problem they could disappear as a party yeah if they don't if they don't eject
[2:57:15.440 --> 2:57:22.560]  the far left all right well sticks thank you so much for the time sticks sticks
[2:57:22.560 --> 2:57:29.280]  sticks sticks what's the best what's the best place for people to find you uh tarle warwick

[3:00:02.560 --> 3:00:08.160]  you know i can't answer your question um but i'll try my best he's not here but ray in iowa
[3:00:08.160 --> 3:00:13.360]  has a question for norm paddus when he's back on the next few days i'll ask him go ahead ray you're
[3:00:13.360 --> 3:00:21.600]  on the air yeah alex alex yes sir hey i've been a long time listener man i i've been listening
[3:00:21.600 --> 3:00:27.120]  to you since you slaughtered old pierce morgan which was that was sweet by the way but uh
[3:00:27.760 --> 3:00:33.200]  at any rate no i i just wondered i was i listened to david night david night's a hero man he's a
[3:00:33.200 --> 3:00:38.560]  his word is golden norm paddus is on there and he absolutely lied about roger stone kind of
[3:00:38.560 --> 3:00:43.840]  missed me a little bit he said that it was clear that roger stone lied under oath and that's not
[3:00:43.840 --> 3:00:50.160]  true that was taken out of uh that was taken out of context man well norm's my lawyer on the whole
[3:00:50.160 --> 3:00:54.640]  sandy hook and etiquette thing and he even had sat on there like five times sorry i didn't pay attention
[3:00:54.640 --> 3:00:58.160]  to the trial i was believing the news but that's what but the alex that's what i mean he said
[3:00:58.160 --> 3:01:02.640]  that's what he said he said well i hadn't really listened but he told david night well you know
[3:01:02.640 --> 3:01:08.160]  roger stone clearly lied under oath and that's not true and i i kind of took a no no i hear you
[3:01:08.160 --> 3:01:15.520]  i mean i'm not gonna attack norm but no i mean i i was here and roger was trying to get a job here
[3:01:16.160 --> 3:01:22.000]  and i said you know get trump again or get me julian assigned you you get the job and i ended
[3:01:22.000 --> 3:01:27.360]  up giving the job anyways but i i i mean he was here he's like well i'm talking to the intermediaries
[3:01:27.360 --> 3:01:33.200]  at wikileaks and i'm like screw assigned he talks to everybody he should talk to us i'm on record
[3:01:33.200 --> 3:01:38.080]  you know attacking assigned for that and so i remember and so he's like before congress well no
[3:01:38.080 --> 3:01:42.480]  i've talked to intermediaries but not assigned but then he gives speeches going yes i'm talking to
[3:01:42.480 --> 3:01:48.560]  wikileaks again if you call my office and say i want to talk to alex jones they go sorry he can't
[3:01:48.560 --> 3:01:55.600]  talk to you you talk to my office like you talk to wikileaks it's not a lie and and so that's what
[3:01:55.600 --> 3:02:01.920]  happened and it doesn't even matter hillary's this chai con agent committing all these crimes
[3:02:01.920 --> 3:02:08.080]  she doesn't get in trouble and roger's facing seven to nine years for saying to congress i never
[3:02:08.080 --> 3:02:15.040]  talked to julian assigned he didn't it's a turn of phrase he gave other speeches saying i'm talking
[3:02:15.040 --> 3:02:21.200]  to wikileaks he was i was talking to wikileaks sending a message and saying i want to sign john
[3:02:21.200 --> 3:02:26.640]  talking to assigned his lawyers i never talked to assigned big frickin deal that's why i called
[3:02:26.640 --> 3:02:33.120]  assigned hillary clinton's butt plug because he was hiding all the dirt on her and i was mad and
[3:02:33.120 --> 3:02:39.680]  said release it he ended up releasing it and now in hindsight i appreciate julian assigned but imagine
[3:02:41.680 --> 3:02:46.880]  facing prison time for trying to interview someone that everybody else had talked to
[3:02:46.880 --> 3:02:53.200]  that that's what we're talking about here right no i i get it no i i get it that's why i say to me
[3:02:53.200 --> 3:02:58.480]  it seemed like it the whole thing was taken out of context yes no you're no he yeah but lawyers
[3:02:58.480 --> 3:03:04.160]  parse words so they're like well wait you say you were talking to assigned and wikileaks
[3:03:05.280 --> 3:03:10.880]  and again you come to info wars you knock on the door i want to talk to alex jones well he's not here
[3:03:10.880 --> 3:03:17.040]  you talked info wars did you talk to me no it's it's all how many angels can dance on the head of
[3:03:17.040 --> 3:03:23.040]  a pen brother so then so then what is roger's student the stone do at this point so so how does
[3:03:23.040 --> 3:03:29.600]  the thing go because it almost sounds to me like that i mean it's a seemingly to me that you even
[3:03:29.600 --> 3:03:35.440]  you were saying that roger stone lied under oath no i'm not saying that well that's what i'm trying
[3:03:35.440 --> 3:03:40.960]  to say is that norm patis was on uh david night okay listen we're not a cult brother i don't control
[3:03:40.960 --> 3:03:50.160]  it my guests say roger never talked to assigns i was here he was talking to wikileaks so he said
[3:03:50.160 --> 3:03:56.400]  i'm talking to wikileaks we hear it's gonna be really big assigns as people said it's hillary
[3:03:56.400 --> 3:04:03.120]  it's big he said that on fox and cnn the new york times roger was stating at the time
[3:04:03.120 --> 3:04:11.040]  time what was already public knowledge and so i appreciate your call but i'm i'm totally confused
[3:04:11.040 --> 3:04:18.400]  ray i love you to death but i just you know i'm not saying roger lied under oath just i didn't
[3:04:18.400 --> 3:04:25.440]  say that so i you keep wanting me to say that and i'll snap your neck like a breadstick in a loving
[3:04:25.440 --> 3:04:33.680]  way i mean it's to a certain point i'm not saying the things you're saying i'm saying and it pisses
[3:04:33.680 --> 3:04:42.080]  me off okay and roger didn't do anything okay i was there in fact if anybody was had a cattle
[3:04:42.080 --> 3:04:47.040]  prod in his ass it was me i was like you get me julian assigns and trump again you want that money
[3:04:47.920 --> 3:04:54.960]  i know he wasn't talking to him i was there i have confirmed with high level sources that
[3:04:54.960 --> 3:05:00.560]  president trump is intending to either pardon roger stone after his sentencing or give him
[3:05:00.560 --> 3:05:06.800]  clemency saying the conviction stands but you now basically don't go to jail either way this is
[3:05:06.800 --> 3:05:12.640]  incredibly good news but let's not forget julian assigns that's one of the biggest black marks on
[3:05:12.640 --> 3:05:17.760]  trump is that he famously said i don't know who got the emails i don't know where they came from
[3:05:17.760 --> 3:05:22.560]  the russians a fat dude in his mom's basement whoever's got him release him it's about hillary
[3:05:22.560 --> 3:05:28.000]  committing a crime not who has the emails don't change the subject well julian assigns undoubtedly
[3:05:28.000 --> 3:05:33.120]  took trump over the top the wiki leaks exposed the deep state the man is a hero daniel elsberg
[3:05:33.120 --> 3:05:37.920]  was a hero well assigns is even a bigger hero and he's rotting in solitary confinement and
[3:05:37.920 --> 3:05:43.120]  court hearings can barely talk president trump do the right thing and ask the british to release
[3:05:43.120 --> 3:06:08.480]  julian assigns and give him a medal you know we can get caught up all day in my new show
[3:06:08.480 --> 3:06:15.760]  and god knows i'd do it worse than anybody but i'm gonna explain this again roger stone never
[3:06:15.760 --> 3:06:23.840]  talked to julian assigns and that'd be totally normal to talk to him if he did and i had lawyers
[3:06:23.840 --> 3:06:29.840]  on the air and guests that say things i don't agree with we're not cnn where jeff sucker puts
[3:06:29.840 --> 3:06:35.520]  out a message and then that is taken like the word of jesus christ and everyone else repeats it
[3:06:35.520 --> 3:06:40.960]  i'm not running a cult here they've asked me in lawsuits like why this host say this and you
[3:06:40.960 --> 3:06:49.360]  said that and this host said this because i'm not running a cult i got people i respect on the air
[3:06:49.360 --> 3:06:54.560]  we have debates about things that's how the real world works not some screwed up middle patient
[3:06:54.560 --> 3:07:00.560]  thing where everything's a calculated this or that we're really trying to figure things out here
[3:07:00.560 --> 3:07:11.440]  and that's how the real world works but i know roger stone only thing he did was advise the president
[3:07:12.320 --> 3:07:18.080]  to run for president and he was on the phone almost every day with him telling him what he
[3:07:18.080 --> 3:07:22.800]  thought he should do and they had his phones tapped and i remember when they'd be on the phone with
[3:07:22.800 --> 3:07:27.520]  roger at steakhouse he's talking to the president after he was elected and rogers like you got to
[3:07:27.520 --> 3:07:32.080]  get rid of these p on the hill and big master and they're gonna screw you i mean they weren't
[3:07:32.080 --> 3:07:37.280]  listening to the president's phone call they were pissed that roger was giving him good counsel
[3:07:37.280 --> 3:07:44.960]  as a conciliatory that's what they're pissed about was that roger wouldn't bow to them so they said
[3:07:44.960 --> 3:07:53.040]  we're gonna put your advisor in jail for what he did and that's what this really is so we can
[3:07:53.040 --> 3:07:59.760]  consider all day and debate this or that or any of this crap roger stone didn't do anything
[3:07:59.760 --> 3:08:04.080]  and it's not about kissing roger's ass if he did something wrong send his ass to prison
[3:08:06.480 --> 3:08:12.160]  but if they can send the innocent man to prison in america for free speech and for advising the
[3:08:12.160 --> 3:08:18.320]  president successfully then they can send anybody to prison and we're all in danger and that's why
[3:08:18.320 --> 3:08:26.560]  i'm pissed off so some lawyers on my show and says maybe roger did purge himself that's that
[3:08:26.560 --> 3:08:32.960]  has nothing to do with me what i say is what i say that that's what matters right here because the
[3:08:32.960 --> 3:08:39.360]  minute i try to start controlling what my guests say i might as well blow my brains out because
[3:08:39.360 --> 3:08:49.840]  that's impossible the buck stops with me what i say is what i believe what guests say or what other
[3:08:49.840 --> 3:08:56.400]  hosts say is them and if i just if i decide somebody works for me is a liar i'll fire them
[3:08:56.400 --> 3:09:01.920]  but if one of my crew disagrees with me and brings up legit legitimate points then i'm going to
[3:09:01.920 --> 3:09:12.960]  listen to that because i'm not a cult leader thank you i'm not a cult leader i want people to
[3:09:12.960 --> 3:09:19.200]  challenge me i want people to bring up good points i want to be smart and you're not smart
[3:09:19.760 --> 3:09:25.200]  when you're in a echo chamber that's the democratic party with all their bs they don't know why they
[3:09:25.200 --> 3:09:30.240]  keep losing because they only believe their own bs they've got a bunch of yes men around them
[3:09:30.240 --> 3:09:34.560]  i tell people to work for me i said you get bad news you tell me right now and you disagree with me
[3:09:34.560 --> 3:09:39.120]  you tell me right now it's legitimate that's what the world is really about
[3:09:42.960 --> 3:09:47.360]  underwrote the jury foreman and roger stone case testified that she had no recollection
[3:09:47.360 --> 3:09:52.160]  of who roger stone was yeah that's a mic service tweet and they caught her on twitter
[3:09:52.640 --> 3:09:59.520]  before she was ever a juror talking crap about him yeah yeah exactly so yeah we probably should
[3:09:59.520 --> 3:10:06.720]  have a stay on that uh conviction right because that judge bergman jackson whatever her name is
[3:10:06.720 --> 3:10:11.680]  is lucky she's not going to be in prison herself god these people might be sick
[3:10:11.680 --> 3:10:18.880]  daniel in texas thanks for holding her on the air go ahead oh yes sir i was calling about um well
[3:10:18.880 --> 3:10:24.800]  first that lgbtq whatever stuff all that and you know i think that we're all pretty much going to
[3:10:24.800 --> 3:10:32.320]  lose if if they if trump i could just at least sign saying hey this is a you know this is blatant
[3:10:32.320 --> 3:10:37.760]  child abuse sign a presidential order and have them you know just stop drag queens for story time i mean
[3:10:37.760 --> 3:10:42.480]  is that well there's no doubt i don't care if you're homosexual or heterosexual kids are off limits
[3:10:42.480 --> 3:10:50.320]  leave me alone and and uh the democrats definitely have a hunger for children and it's disgusting
[3:10:50.320 --> 3:10:58.560]  exactly and see that's the spiritual battle about that i think that's where another fear of mine is
[3:10:58.560 --> 3:11:03.280]  that when if they implement 6g like whatever everything has in common with the the cell
[3:11:03.280 --> 3:11:10.880]  towers and the 2g 3g 4g 5g they're implementing now at the same time while suppressing free speech
[3:11:10.880 --> 3:11:16.640]  the chakra system the human body uh chakra system is the throat chakra is the fifth uh
[3:11:16.640 --> 3:11:21.360]  the fifth chakra so when i think that well there's no doubt there's an attack on the
[3:11:21.360 --> 3:11:29.840]  biological system of humans exactly and and then if they get 6g i like that's the pineal gland area
[3:11:29.840 --> 3:11:35.680]  like i mean wouldn't that cut off all of our connection to god well there's no doubt they
[3:11:35.680 --> 3:11:40.640]  can use electromagnetic systems to manipulate human psychological activities i appreciate you
[3:11:40.640 --> 3:11:44.640]  daniel thanks for the call scott indiana then austin and florida you're on the air go ahead
[3:11:44.640 --> 3:11:51.440]  hey what's going on alex man i'm just up here just watching all i'm watching the whole new
[3:11:51.440 --> 3:11:56.240]  old order blow up in front of me yeah it's it's crazy man i've been a fan for a long time i've
[3:11:56.240 --> 3:12:02.480]  been listening to you since uh 95 back when you were you know covering covering the weiko wow so
[3:12:02.480 --> 3:12:08.800]  you've been listening 20 wow 25 26 years brother yes i have been following you every every step of
[3:12:08.800 --> 3:12:12.960]  the way have it hard to believe we've been on the air that long it's like we didn't just start this
[3:12:12.960 --> 3:12:17.920]  up yesterday yeah there's been some things you said that i don't agree with but i've always respected
[3:12:17.920 --> 3:12:23.200]  your opinion uh the reason i wanted to call in today you know was about this coronavirus stuff uh
[3:12:23.840 --> 3:12:26.960]  you know it's pretty obvious that they're not telling us the whole story uh
[3:12:28.000 --> 3:12:33.280]  they're saying that it's it's only you know 10 12 cases here in the united states alex well that's
[3:12:33.280 --> 3:12:40.720]  total horse crap alex every single person that i know is either sick with the flu or has someone
[3:12:40.720 --> 3:12:45.440]  in their in their family with respiratory syndrome oh yeah listen it's been over four years inside a
[3:12:45.440 --> 3:12:52.160]  fever i got one a week ago everybody i know is coughing their guts out there's like 500 kids from
[3:12:52.160 --> 3:12:58.240]  their school uh you know this is uh i think potentially a lot bigger uh you know than what
[3:12:58.240 --> 3:13:02.560]  they're saying and uh the one thing i wanted to ask you and i'll get on here because i know we got
[3:13:02.560 --> 3:13:07.600]  some other people calling on is you know suppose uh this does come out that this is a chinese
[3:13:07.600 --> 3:13:12.720]  biological weapon uh you know than what uh you know somebody has to be held responsible uh
[3:13:13.840 --> 3:13:19.040]  does that mean this is going to be a world war three brother i don't think that's going to
[3:13:19.040 --> 3:13:23.600]  happen but there's no doubt this has been engineered the question is then what was it engineered for
[3:13:23.600 --> 3:13:27.920]  i appreciate your call we don't have those answers yet i don't have those answers if i told you i'd
[3:13:27.920 --> 3:13:31.920]  be lying to you i'm not going to do that it's easy to set up here and say we have all the answers
[3:13:31.920 --> 3:13:37.200]  but i've got four children and i hope it's not as bad as they're saying but the evidence
[3:13:37.200 --> 3:13:40.480]  leans towards it not being good and being engineered so
[3:13:43.520 --> 3:13:48.480]  prepare for the worst hope for the best as i say austin and florida thank you for calling
[3:13:48.480 --> 3:13:54.160]  last caller before matt bracken takes over hey alex can you hear me okay i can thank you

[3:19:04.080 --> 3:19:09.680]  caught hold not just here in the u.s. worldwide and president trump's fearlessness when it comes to
[3:19:09.680 --> 3:19:16.080]  promoting americana and basic liberty is amazing as well you're still lacking on the big tech
[3:19:16.080 --> 3:19:21.120]  censorship taking action against that in some other areas but trying to end the wars boosting
[3:19:21.120 --> 3:19:26.240]  our economy speaking out against communist china trump's been doing an amazing job but now more
[3:19:26.240 --> 3:19:32.800]  than ever we really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective and the
[3:19:32.800 --> 3:19:38.240]  globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way and so we're going to see
[3:19:38.240 --> 3:19:44.160]  some major fireworks out of them but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the
[3:19:44.160 --> 3:19:50.240]  poison they spray at us that's an attempt to moralize us we've got to remember that and stay focused

[3:20:16.240 --> 3:20:21.280]  very very soon and you know if that's not a good thing but it's also a good thing because i have a
[3:20:21.280 --> 3:20:28.400]  lot of clips i want to get to and a lot of news i want to cover tyler nixon is a really interesting
[3:20:28.400 --> 3:20:34.560]  smart guy and who is roger stone's private lawyer was scared to come on my show in a good way two
[3:20:34.560 --> 3:20:41.520]  days ago but he got so mad last night he went on the war with owing shroy and he laid out a lot of
[3:20:41.520 --> 3:20:47.520]  powerful information here's some of what he had to say i'll tell you what yesterday after over a year
[3:20:47.520 --> 3:20:52.960]  of this ordeal which really was more than a year because they began uh essentially dismantling
[3:20:52.960 --> 3:21:00.160]  or dissecting roger's life uh you know calling in everybody he works with uh rummaging through his
[3:21:00.160 --> 3:21:06.560]  garbage you name it you know it's it's been a year of just constant piling on with this government
[3:21:06.560 --> 3:21:16.640]  juggernaut run by abusive malicious power mad crypto partisan corrupt prosecutors persecutors
[3:21:16.640 --> 3:21:21.040]  really is what they are they're not prosecutors they're persecutors running roger through these
[3:21:21.040 --> 3:21:29.360]  through this completely contrived overblown bogus hair splitting but yet highly consequential on
[3:21:29.360 --> 3:21:35.520]  paper if you know because of the penalties involved case against him and this is the first
[3:21:35.520 --> 3:21:40.480]  yesterday was the first year and roger agreed with me i texted him late last night and said i think
[3:21:40.480 --> 3:21:44.800]  this is the first day that we you know you've actually had a break that we've actually been able
[3:21:44.800 --> 3:21:52.800]  to see some level of ray of hope for justice in this matter uh and and the people who have abused
[3:21:52.800 --> 3:22:01.520]  and uh tortured in many ways roger stone bankrupted him uh have have framed him have uh railroaded him
[3:22:01.520 --> 3:22:07.040]  are now being uh scattered you know they're they're scattering like bugs uh now that
[3:22:07.040 --> 3:22:14.160]  president trump and uh attorney general bar have focused on this case and the outrage the outrageous
[3:22:14.160 --> 3:22:19.200]  sentencing memorandum they submitted which was frankly chock full of outright falsehoods uh
[3:22:19.200 --> 3:22:25.920]  uh misstatements uh manipulations very just you know consistent with how they ran the entire case
[3:22:25.920 --> 3:22:30.720]  you know it was literally like i i felt like i just read a dnc talking points memo that's
[3:22:30.720 --> 3:22:36.240]  who it could have been drafted by and that's frankly who these crooked uh despicable prosecutors
[3:22:36.240 --> 3:22:42.000]  were serving in the end i mean this was these were hillary obama uh loyalists embedded in
[3:22:42.000 --> 3:22:48.160]  the department of justice who were tasked and assigned to essentially uh string up roger stone
[3:22:48.160 --> 3:22:52.640]  to lynch him you know it's i call it the witch hunt lynch mob is what these guys were there were
[3:22:52.640 --> 3:22:58.640]  four of them they were uh you know they were gleeful they were out over the top uh manipulative
[3:22:58.640 --> 3:23:05.600]  disingenuous deceitful uh in bringing this uh this malicious prosecution against roger and
[3:23:05.600 --> 3:23:13.120]  destroying his life and now he faces prison and they have the gall to present a bogus fantasy
[3:23:13.120 --> 3:23:19.360]  uh derived sentencing memorandum asking for seven to nine years of this of a 67 year old man's life
[3:23:19.360 --> 3:23:25.040]  the violations of his civil rights are unprecedented in any case i've ever seen in american history
[3:23:25.040 --> 3:23:29.920]  and certainly in my own legal career i've never heard of such draconian uh tyrannical
[3:23:30.640 --> 3:23:35.680]  actions by and and frankly sneaky and you know they this is this is the problem with people
[3:23:35.680 --> 3:23:40.560]  getting people like this into positions where there is no alternative in other words the courts
[3:23:40.560 --> 3:23:45.280]  are our last readout against a tyrannical government when you have a judge who's basically just a
[3:23:45.280 --> 3:23:50.720]  rubber stamp or or more over i mean not even a rubber stamp there were instances where she didn't
[3:23:50.720 --> 3:23:56.000]  even they didn't even have to make their arguments she made them for the government what the democrats
[3:23:56.000 --> 3:24:01.760]  have done in practice is they have weaponized the judicial system they have weaponized it they've
[3:24:01.760 --> 3:24:08.480]  turned it into a political weapon they've put their activist legal snipers on benches and in black
[3:24:08.480 --> 3:24:13.440]  robes to do their bidding and and you know you just get the feeling that they're kind of sitting
[3:24:13.440 --> 3:24:18.960]  back behind closed doors just laughing their asses off at conservatives and trump supporters
[3:24:18.960 --> 3:24:24.880]  because they're sitting here like we got this big gun we got this big bazooka the judicial system
[3:24:24.880 --> 3:24:29.200]  and we're just firing at will and they're not doing anything yeah well it's like the devil
[3:24:29.200 --> 3:24:34.960]  can do anything he wants you know he can he can be the most grotesque abusive disgusting vile piece
[3:24:34.960 --> 3:24:41.440]  of crap when and attack people and just you know slaughter and maim and mutilate but if you're on the
[3:24:41.440 --> 3:24:46.160]  side of good and you're fighting that you can't do that you can't murder in the name of justice
[3:24:46.160 --> 3:24:52.640]  you know you can't string people up in the name of you know a good civil society you cannot tell
[3:24:52.640 --> 3:24:58.080]  me that president trump did not understand what was going on i think he's a keen guy and i think
[3:24:58.080 --> 3:25:02.480]  he's he's he's someone who does care about his friends and especially someone who he's seeing
[3:25:02.480 --> 3:25:06.800]  you know i don't think i don't think trump's like a touchy feely guy who's like oh you know he loves
[3:25:06.800 --> 3:25:11.760]  everybody around him but i think he is someone who who abhors injustice and does not want to see
[3:25:11.760 --> 3:25:17.760]  people get screwed or railroaded or you know especially under his watch so to speak i think
[3:25:17.760 --> 3:25:22.800]  he's the type of guy he may not he may not you know be be slapping you on the back and telling
[3:25:22.800 --> 3:25:28.000]  jokes and making you feel good but if someone tries to harm you and you're under his sort of umbrella
[3:25:28.000 --> 3:25:32.880]  he will come in like gangbusters and make sure that that the uh the bad guys are taken care of
[3:25:32.880 --> 3:25:38.560]  and that you're protected well in the last couple months there's been two new york times
[3:25:38.560 --> 3:25:44.400]  articles and one said roger stone's conviction is a consolation prize and to show how they put
[3:25:44.400 --> 3:25:49.840]  out talking points that another writer said alex jones getting sued and alex jones that's a consolation
[3:25:49.840 --> 3:25:55.280]  prize so they just want a weird mentally ill victory like we're messing with somebody that
[3:25:55.280 --> 3:26:00.240]  supports trump we're going to ruin their life that makes us feel powerful but i got to tell you
[3:26:00.240 --> 3:26:05.680]  as big as epstein was and it was huge people waking up when they killed him and in a jail cell
[3:26:06.320 --> 3:26:12.800]  this roger stone thing there's no russia gate there's no russian agents there's no spying there's
[3:26:12.800 --> 3:26:19.040]  no money there's nothing lying to congress when he didn't he said i've never talked to a son he's
[3:26:19.040 --> 3:26:23.360]  to say i've talked to wiki leaks totally two different things so they keep playing that
[3:26:23.360 --> 3:26:31.520]  that semantical game of well did you you say you talked to a son but you didn't you got a jail
[3:26:31.520 --> 3:26:38.080]  for that longer than armed robber does they've really jumped the shark here now some of these
[3:26:38.080 --> 3:26:43.440]  clips i want to get to is uh trump saying the democrats are crooked and the media is saying
[3:26:43.440 --> 3:26:49.120]  oh saying that obstruction of justice or saying you'll part and stone is obstruction of justice
[3:26:49.120 --> 3:26:56.720]  or saying that the uh recommended time by these prosecutors is too long they lied to the justice
[3:26:56.720 --> 3:27:00.000]  department it turns out a month ago and said he was only going to get recommended a year
[3:27:00.000 --> 3:27:05.920]  but then they're to the judge they said seven to nine years so there's just so much fraud these
[3:27:05.920 --> 3:27:10.560]  guys are going for broke here's the president talking about it Lisa Murkowski earlier said
[3:27:10.560 --> 3:27:13.920]  that you should have gotten involved with the roger stone case she said it's just bad some
[3:27:13.920 --> 3:27:18.640]  republicans have said they hoped you would learn a lesson from impeachment what lesson did you learn
[3:27:18.640 --> 3:27:24.480]  from impeachment that the democrats are crooked they've got a lot of crooked things going that
[3:27:24.480 --> 3:27:29.680]  they're vicious that they shouldn't have brought impeachment anything that my poll numbers are
[3:27:29.680 --> 3:27:35.440]  10 points higher because of fake news like nbc which reports the news very inaccurately probably
[3:27:35.440 --> 3:27:44.000]  more inaccurately than cnn if that's possible uh ms dnc and your ms and if you take a look at nbc
[3:27:44.000 --> 3:27:48.560]  and i think they're among the most dishonest reporters of the news okay thank you very much
[3:27:48.560 --> 3:27:56.400]  everybody once they say that and go oh i'm so sorry you ran a whole fake operation against me
[3:27:56.400 --> 3:28:04.800]  let's go out to break with uh don jr here it is the silence was deafening uh you know when i when i
[3:28:04.800 --> 3:28:08.400]  see that happen and by the way the violence against conservatives and republicans and
[3:28:08.400 --> 3:28:16.560]  trump supporters it is so prevalent and so under reported i mean if at all i mean if the shoe was
[3:28:16.560 --> 3:28:22.000]  on the other foot and that was a some sort of pretend you know crazy right wing alt right whatever
[3:28:22.000 --> 3:28:27.440]  person doing it to a bernie sanders or an elizabeth it would be the number one news story all over
[3:28:27.440 --> 3:28:33.200]  america there's not a journalist that wouldn't be covering it ad nauseam for weeks but when it happens
[3:28:33.200 --> 3:28:38.400]  to a trump supporter um you know it's honestly it's getting to the point of tacit complicity
[3:28:38.400 --> 3:28:42.880]  from the left and from the media which are basically the same thing at this point it's
[3:28:42.880 --> 3:28:48.320]  truly disgusting it would be one of the largest if not the largest story superseding all of the
[3:28:48.320 --> 3:28:54.560]  primary stuff all of the craziness in iowa if we can all agree these are troubled times right

[3:30:46.880 --> 3:30:56.560]  jones i want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because i hadn't tried it except for
[3:30:56.560 --> 3:31:01.360]  maybe the last week and a half and um i told alex i said man this is the best toothpaste i've ever
[3:31:01.360 --> 3:31:04.800]  tried he's like well what are you doing just sitting in here telling me you got to get up there and
[3:31:04.800 --> 3:31:11.520]  tell me and oh so here i am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best
[3:31:11.520 --> 3:31:16.560]  toothpaste i've ever tried and i'm 45 years old and i've tried a lot of different toothpaste
[3:31:16.560 --> 3:31:21.600]  and it's fluoride free i think the big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium
[3:31:21.600 --> 3:31:27.120]  because after i brush my teeth with this they feel so clean and the toothpaste that i don't even like
[3:31:27.120 --> 3:31:32.880]  rinse out my mouth after i brush my teeth with this it feels so good it feels like it feels like
[3:31:32.880 --> 3:31:37.680]  like good things are happening in my mouth in fact i find myself brushing my teeth
[3:31:38.320 --> 3:31:43.200]  three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because i like the way it feels
[3:31:52.400 --> 3:31:56.720]  well it's finally happening the president is coming out and saying the deep state
[3:31:56.720 --> 3:32:01.680]  are a bunch of out of control criminals that need to be prosecuted and he has fired over
[3:32:01.680 --> 3:32:08.800]  two hundred senior bureaucrats in the state department and the justice department in just
[3:32:08.800 --> 3:32:15.200]  the last few days and he took the head prosecutor over stone and offered her a job at treasury
[3:32:15.200 --> 3:32:21.040]  as soon as she quit that job he then withdrew the nomination and now she's out on her globalist
[3:32:21.040 --> 3:32:27.840]  ass this is beautiful it's happening but we need to see a lot more all the neocons need to be fired
[3:32:27.840 --> 3:32:34.000]  all the obama appointees fired all the deep state globalist who have resumes with george soros
[3:32:34.000 --> 3:32:42.320]  fired fired fired fired trump is finally unleashed trump is not the red wave he is the red storm
[3:32:42.320 --> 3:32:49.360]  and info wars is the tip of the spear powered by we the people never backing down never giving in
[3:32:49.360 --> 3:32:57.920]  and delivering victory in our time you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:32:57.920 --> 3:33:14.960]  resistance to tyrants his obedience to god it's alex jones
[3:33:14.960 --> 3:33:31.760]  you know i don't want to be overly positive about trump finally fighting back and what's
[3:33:31.760 --> 3:33:38.400]  happening because we have to think about what we're opposing i mean we're opposing
[3:33:38.400 --> 3:33:45.920]  burning sanders and communism that we know flies like a lead balloon a lead zeppelin
[3:33:46.880 --> 3:33:52.640]  and so it's like wait we're barely winning against the most evil ridiculous crap world's ever seen
[3:33:53.760 --> 3:33:59.200]  america is in a coma and let's not lie to ourselves about that we've all got problems
[3:33:59.200 --> 3:34:06.960]  i got problems i'm a decadent slob in many ways but at least i recognize good from evil
[3:34:08.480 --> 3:34:13.120]  so this is a really important boil down some of the crew put together of some of the outrageous
[3:34:13.680 --> 3:34:21.280]  things that bernie sanders is putting out and the fact that a third of americans roughly think
[3:34:21.280 --> 3:34:26.800]  this is a good idea here's what he had to say you know it's funny sometimes american journalists
[3:34:26.800 --> 3:34:32.560]  talk about how bad a country is because people are lining up for food that's a good thing in other
[3:34:32.560 --> 3:34:36.400]  countries people don't line up for food the rich gets the food and the poor starve to death
[3:34:37.680 --> 3:34:41.520]  you know as as a socialist the word socialism does not frighten me i think when we were in
[3:34:41.520 --> 3:34:47.760]  moscow for example i think most of the people here also were extremely impressed by their
[3:34:47.760 --> 3:34:54.240]  public transportation system the stations themselves were absolutely beautiful uh including many works
[3:34:54.240 --> 3:35:00.080]  of art chandeliers that were beautiful it was a very very effective system also i was impressed
[3:35:00.080 --> 3:35:06.560]  by the youth programs that they have uh their palaces of of culture for the young people
[3:35:06.560 --> 3:35:13.200]  a whole variety of young of programs for young people and cultural programs which go far beyond
[3:35:13.200 --> 3:35:18.720]  what we do in this country to china and its leadership is if i'm not mistaken they have made
[3:35:18.720 --> 3:35:25.680]  more progress in addressing extreme poverty than any country in the history of civilization
[3:35:25.680 --> 3:35:29.760]  okay so they've done a lot of things for their people but i remember for some reason rather
[3:35:29.760 --> 3:35:33.760]  being very excited when when fidel kashto made the revolution in cuba and i was a kid and i
[3:35:33.760 --> 3:35:38.160]  remember reading that and it was just seen right and appropriate that poor people were rising up
[3:35:38.160 --> 3:35:43.600]  against rather ugly rich people you may recall way back in what was it 1961 they invaded cuba
[3:35:43.600 --> 3:35:48.080]  and everybody was totally convinced that kashto was the worst guy in the world all the cuban
[3:35:48.080 --> 3:35:52.320]  people were going to rise up and rebellion against fidel kashto they forgot that he educated their
[3:35:52.320 --> 3:35:58.800]  kids gave them health care totally transformed the society but just because fidel reggae dislikes
[3:35:58.800 --> 3:36:03.280]  these people does not mean to say that the people in their own nations feel the same way but have
[3:36:03.280 --> 3:36:09.120]  some good things when donning cuba yes how do you find the sincerity of sending these to leaders
[3:36:09.120 --> 3:36:15.520]  i was impressed i was impressed by father diskota because he is a very gentle very loving man uh
[3:36:15.520 --> 3:36:22.320]  what kind of is an impressive guy uh Ernesto cardinal is a funny looking guy he's gray hair
[3:36:22.320 --> 3:36:27.840]  and he really does revive you of a hippie why have you stopped short of calling maduro a venezuela
[3:36:27.840 --> 3:36:40.400]  a dictator well he i think it's it's fair to say that the last election was undemocratic uh but there
[3:36:40.400 --> 3:36:53.520]  are still democratic operations taking place in that country this man will destroy you
[3:36:57.200 --> 3:37:02.800]  and if you look at the big corporations who are they funding they're funding a bunch of democrats
[3:37:06.080 --> 3:37:09.120]  because they're billionaires they've already written the laws they've got it on where they
[3:37:09.120 --> 3:37:14.400]  don't pay the tax and they want you believing some communist is going to give you a free lunch
[3:37:15.200 --> 3:37:20.240]  so you don't organize and promote better trade deals
[3:37:22.880 --> 3:37:29.520]  and lower taxes and things that we know will turn this economy loose it's it's really
[3:37:30.400 --> 3:37:35.680]  nauseating to think we're up here celebrating that trump's winning just barely against that
[3:37:35.680 --> 3:37:44.000]  I mean they don't have toilet paper to wipe their asses in Venezuela or North Korea folks
[3:37:47.200 --> 3:37:51.760]  we sit here with all this wealth and all this power and bitching and playing about it
[3:37:51.760 --> 3:37:56.560]  because we've got so many choices compared to other people it's just there's no even comparison
[3:37:56.560 --> 3:38:03.520]  it's like it's like arguing that you shouldn't shoot yourself in the head with a gun but there's
[3:38:03.520 --> 3:38:11.600]  Bernie Sanders with his bozo hair and all his dumbass academics who want to run things those
[3:38:11.600 --> 3:38:16.000]  academics know they're not going to get free stuff in the communist system except they're
[3:38:16.000 --> 3:38:21.840]  going to run things they're not going to run a company that employs people and has to compete
[3:38:21.840 --> 3:38:28.560]  in the market they're not going to have a farm they're going to sit there with a gun to your head
[3:38:28.560 --> 3:38:37.200]  and tell you how to live your life that's what communism is capitalism's problem is it produces
[3:38:37.200 --> 3:38:42.160]  so much damn wealth that it creates a bunch of decadent jackasses let's just be honest about it
[3:38:43.040 --> 3:38:49.440]  prosperity creates monsters adversity creates men as Victor Hugo the french philosopher said it's true
[3:38:51.600 --> 3:38:57.120]  I'm a spoil brat compared to my dad and his dad and my children a spoil brat's compared to me
[3:38:57.120 --> 3:39:03.040]  I'm gonna put my kids down it's true I did it I messed up maybe they're gonna wake up but they
[3:39:03.040 --> 3:39:12.880]  just don't get it hey dad I want a new jacket I want some new shoes go get a job I was 12
[3:39:14.080 --> 3:39:18.560]  I'm like my dad thought I was so smart I go dad there's labor laws against that he goes
[3:39:18.560 --> 3:39:24.080]  people ignore those forget what he goes I bet you go down to that marina right now
[3:39:24.080 --> 3:39:30.960]  and get a job over there actually did I was like wow I got all this money he goes yeah
[3:39:32.400 --> 3:39:37.920]  man give me part of it pay for the light bill but the point was is that he wasn't being a dick
[3:39:38.880 --> 3:39:43.920]  he was like not trying to create a jellyfish well my kids are great but they're jellyfish compared
[3:39:43.920 --> 3:39:50.560]  to me compared to my dad and it's like what have we done that now my kids know Bernie Sanders is
[3:39:50.560 --> 3:39:55.760]  full of crap they're smart enough to know capitalism is the reason they're doing so well but imagine the
[3:39:55.760 --> 3:40:05.920]  next step down where you actually believe some bozo the clown commie some shyster swindler
[3:40:06.560 --> 3:40:12.400]  like Bernie Sanders is going to give you all this free stuff only thing he's going to give
[3:40:12.400 --> 3:40:25.840]  you is a firing squad man but his whole life he never had a real job and he's just there
[3:40:26.560 --> 3:40:34.560]  to rule over everybody and tell us how we're supposed to live because he has that intellectual
[3:40:34.560 --> 3:40:45.920]  clown haircut but enough about him I've got so much news here it'll make your head spin
[3:40:47.920 --> 3:40:52.800]  but I don't even know where to start here's an info wars.com article
[3:40:54.320 --> 3:40:59.520]  youtube deletes a video of Rand Paul saying name of CIA whistleblower on senate floor
[3:40:59.520 --> 3:41:07.680]  we live in a country where a senator saying the name of a fake whistleblower is censored
[3:41:08.560 --> 3:41:12.160]  and Trump says well that's what private companies can do they can do whatever they want
[3:41:13.680 --> 3:41:19.840]  really I didn't know that free market capitalism was a suicide pact
[3:41:19.840 --> 3:41:29.120]  because it's not we believe you own your house and you own your bank account
[3:41:29.120 --> 3:41:35.760]  but you don't own the utilities of communications to get into a phone call or a text message or a
[3:41:35.760 --> 3:41:40.880]  video and then to come in and say I'm gonna block that and I'm gonna control with somebody
[3:41:40.880 --> 3:41:48.400]  hears or sees that's called authoritarianism we fought wars to stop that and as happy as I am
[3:41:48.400 --> 3:41:57.360]  that Trump's finally rolling out against the enemy on his trajectory that's very nice right now
[3:41:57.360 --> 3:42:03.920]  I mean it's a nice roaring start of going after deep state two weeks a month maximum
[3:42:04.480 --> 3:42:10.720]  if I don't see action by the president against these racketeers and these censors I just can't
[3:42:10.720 --> 3:42:15.600]  help it I can't I'm not gonna sell off to anything except the truth I'm gonna have
[3:42:15.600 --> 3:42:20.960]  some big problems and then I'm gonna ask myself what am I gonna do what am I gonna ask the audience
[3:42:20.960 --> 3:42:30.480]  to do to make sure that we do something about this because because if you look at who runs CPAC
[3:42:30.480 --> 3:42:38.560]  and the Republican Party these are a bunch of just cowardly chicken-neck leftist that decided to be
[3:42:38.560 --> 3:42:44.160]  Republicans because they can make more money I mean that's our big problem is that Trump's good but
[3:42:44.160 --> 3:42:52.880]  man the Republican Party are just the scum of the earth it's no secret that our daily lives are

[3:46:08.960 --> 3:46:13.360]  lot of these companies they're fine during normal times but during a crisis they don't keep a bunch
[3:46:13.360 --> 3:46:18.160]  of food on hand because of inventory they'll still take your orders that's why about 11 years ago i
[3:46:18.160 --> 3:46:23.120]  found my patriot supply now the biggest most trusted company out there and i became a private labeler
[3:46:23.120 --> 3:46:26.800]  for them because they actually have it on hand they actually give it delivered to you on time
[3:46:26.800 --> 3:46:30.000]  they do what they're going to say they're going to do because they want you as a customer over
[3:46:30.000 --> 3:46:34.000]  and over again and they're good people now they were saying seven to ten days before shipping
[3:46:34.000 --> 3:46:38.640]  because they've got the food but they got a package at record level orders now it's 10 to 14

[3:47:27.120 --> 3:47:36.080]  part of it right now a us senator giving a speech is now censored by youtube what a bunch of arrogant
[3:47:36.080 --> 3:47:42.400]  jerks just last year sundar bachai said we never censored anything we've we've never heard of that
[3:47:42.400 --> 3:47:46.960]  youtube deletes video of rand paul saying name of cia whistleblower on the senate floor
[3:47:46.960 --> 3:47:51.360]  eric saramalla but first let's get to this
[3:47:54.800 --> 3:48:00.400]  you'll remember six months ago the democrats hollywood were putting out a movie
[3:48:02.480 --> 3:48:07.680]  that was dealing with the hunting down and killing of trump supporters in fact
[3:48:07.680 --> 3:48:16.080]  trump supporters are kidnapped and taken to be hunted trump slams hollywood have been furor
[3:48:16.080 --> 3:48:20.160]  over the hunt movie well they said they weren't going to release it and i said you watch
[3:48:21.840 --> 3:48:28.080]  they will before the election well they just announced a release date and they're going to
[3:48:28.080 --> 3:48:32.320]  be releasing the movie they've got a bunch of other movies just like it you just saw that
[3:48:32.320 --> 3:48:39.120]  guy run over six trump supporters in florida and the media was totally silent this is their only hope
[3:48:39.760 --> 3:48:47.200]  is causing violence is trying to trigger some type of violent conflagration
[3:48:49.920 --> 3:48:55.600]  so here is the attempt to cause a civil war in this country by hollywood just like the joker
[3:48:55.600 --> 3:49:00.800]  was an attempt at that and now we've got cops getting shot in new york and riots on the trains
[3:49:00.800 --> 3:49:07.360]  it's all the same communist dream the same wet dream of these rich hollywood scum that's not
[3:49:07.360 --> 3:49:27.120]  done to succeed hey what is happening what is all of this do you see that article every year these
[3:49:27.120 --> 3:49:32.000]  liberal elites kidnap a bunch of normal folks like us and hunt us for sport
[3:49:32.000 --> 3:49:40.160]  the last i heard free speech till exists don't first amendment me it wasn't real
[3:49:43.120 --> 3:49:45.200]  everything we were joking
[3:49:49.040 --> 3:49:50.960]  there's been a killing spree you gotta come here right now
[3:49:53.200 --> 3:49:57.040]  you actually believed we were hunting human beings for sport
[3:49:57.040 --> 3:50:00.400]  but you are
[3:50:03.440 --> 3:50:06.160]  we have an opportunity here to teach these people
[3:50:08.000 --> 3:50:11.200]  these are not real people they're actors
[3:50:13.760 --> 3:50:19.200]  i'm playing an arab refugee but i identify as white i think that's problematic too in some way
[3:50:19.200 --> 3:50:31.360]  you wanted it to be real so you decided it was
[3:50:31.360 --> 3:50:35.040]  these people would even think of something like that white people
[3:50:35.040 --> 3:50:39.840]  we're the worst and so we have a movie how white people are bad that deserve to be killed
[3:50:39.840 --> 3:50:46.080]  that's where these people are going that's what happens with all the drugs and all the weirdness
[3:50:46.080 --> 3:50:52.800]  in hollywood and silicon valleys like this big demonic spider that just poops all this out on us
[3:50:52.800 --> 3:50:57.920]  and then they want to silence us so they can then misrepresent what we're saying and doing
[3:50:57.920 --> 3:51:01.920]  because that's the key you think oh i've been silenced i don't want to be public anyways
[3:51:01.920 --> 3:51:07.040]  once they silence you well you hear them they tell you you live in the midwest of the south or
[3:51:07.920 --> 3:51:13.360]  the southwest you're a nazi and you're like what let's see they want to dehumanize you
[3:51:13.360 --> 3:51:19.920]  and that's why you being vocal see you're not on a power trip like a leftist who thinks whatever
[3:51:19.920 --> 3:51:25.920]  they say is like god said it no you're not god but you're not going to let them steal your voice
[3:51:25.920 --> 3:51:32.000]  that's why your voice being heard is so critical so they can't steal your identity so this is like
[3:51:32.000 --> 3:51:36.080]  a 10 minute video the full video is up on info wars dot com the war room on shroyer
[3:51:36.080 --> 3:51:44.320]  spanner hernandez is about to take over but this is the video that youtube just removed so let that
[3:51:44.320 --> 3:51:52.240]  sink in in america ai systems watching and blocking what a u.s senator says and trump won't do anything
[3:51:52.240 --> 3:51:59.120]  about it and his justice department just announced that these companies can do this they can election
[3:51:59.120 --> 3:52:06.160]  metal well i hope trump doesn't wake up in 263 days and he's just lost the 2020 election because
[3:52:08.880 --> 3:52:14.880]  this is illegal what's going on here's the report now during the proceedings i asked a question
[3:52:14.880 --> 3:52:20.720]  that was disallowed let's be clear in that video deleted this morning because the constitution does
[3:52:20.720 --> 3:52:25.760]  protect debate and does protect the asking of questions i think they made a big mistake not
[3:52:25.760 --> 3:52:32.640]  allowing my question my question did not talk about anybody who is a whistleblower my question did
[3:52:32.640 --> 3:52:38.560]  not accuse anybody of being a whistleblower it did not make a statement believing that was someone's
[3:52:38.560 --> 3:52:44.560]  whistleblower i simply named two people's names because i think it's very important to know what
[3:52:44.560 --> 3:52:51.360]  happened we're now finding out that the faiza investigation was predicated upon 17 lies by
[3:52:51.360 --> 3:52:56.640]  the fbi by people at high levels who were biased against the president and it turns out it was an
[3:52:56.640 --> 3:53:03.200]  illegitimate investigation everything they did about investigation president was untrue and abused
[3:53:03.200 --> 3:53:07.840]  government to do something they never should have done in the first place so i asked this question
[3:53:08.480 --> 3:53:15.360]  and this is my question my exact question we'll put it up here are you aware that the house
[3:53:15.360 --> 3:53:22.000]  intelligence committee staffer sean misko had a close relationship with eric chiramela while at
[3:53:22.000 --> 3:53:28.320]  the national security council together are you aware and how would you respond to reports that
[3:53:28.320 --> 3:53:35.280]  chiramela and misko may have worked together to plot impeaching the president before there were
[3:53:35.280 --> 3:53:41.600]  formal house impeachment proceedings now why did i ask this question because there are news reports
[3:53:41.600 --> 3:53:46.960]  saying these two people one of them who worked for adam schiff and one of them who worked with
[3:53:46.960 --> 3:53:52.720]  this person at the national security council that they knew each other and had been overheard
[3:53:52.720 --> 3:53:59.600]  talking about impeaching the president in the first month of his office in january of 2017
[3:53:59.600 --> 3:54:05.520]  they were already plotting the impeachment and you say well we should protect the whistleblower
[3:54:05.520 --> 3:54:12.560]  and the whistleblower deserves anonymity so no due process and again i was pointing out there
[3:54:12.560 --> 3:54:20.880]  that there is a uh 10 minute video it's up on info wars dot com it has the full speech they
[3:54:20.880 --> 3:54:25.760]  deleted that was just a short minute and a half two minute clip of it but think about that you're
[3:54:25.760 --> 3:54:35.280]  watching a u.s senator in the well of the senate and that's the video they took down so does big
[3:54:35.280 --> 3:54:42.640]  tech have riches that are too big yeah and everybody just treats it like it's well it's
[3:54:42.640 --> 3:54:48.800]  that fancy thing over there it's it's hot tech we we just can't do anything about it we can't do
[3:54:48.800 --> 3:54:57.280]  anything now that senator paul can't talk in the senate and that's taken down and then by the way
[3:54:57.280 --> 3:55:05.760]  google's like yeah that's not allowed we took him down google helps censor in china they help censor
[3:55:07.920 --> 3:55:15.120]  all over the world and then we sit here and we put up with that everybody asked me two years ago
[3:55:15.120 --> 3:55:19.600]  when i got banned everywhere they said how are you taking it and i said well how are you taking it
[3:55:19.600 --> 3:55:26.080]  because this is an attack on you the things they said i did that i got banned for i didn't do but i
[3:55:26.080 --> 3:55:31.200]  knew i was chosen as a colorful character that they thought they could shut down there was major
[3:55:31.200 --> 3:55:36.880]  pressure on the white house everybody else to go along with it and at a certain point i just said
[3:55:36.880 --> 3:55:43.280]  hey stop worrying about me go ahead and let me get banned but it's going to be everybody else you
[3:55:43.280 --> 3:55:48.960]  got to worry about next week that's what zuckerberg said oh jones want wanted to be banned oh i didn't
[3:55:48.960 --> 3:55:56.320]  want to be banned i just understood the formality of it's alex jones today it's all of you tomorrow
[3:55:57.600 --> 3:56:02.240]  so people walk to me on the street and they say alex i'm really sad about you getting shadow
[3:56:02.240 --> 3:56:07.920]  man everywhere how you taking them i look at him like uh it's like a forest fire coming to your
[3:56:07.920 --> 3:56:12.400]  town and burning by his houses my house burnt down too so is yours you're asking me how i'm doing
[3:56:12.400 --> 3:56:18.880]  that's stupid it already burnt down it's a dumb statement this is affecting everybody
[3:56:21.520 --> 3:56:26.320]  and see collectivists never care about the collective i'm an individualist so i do care
[3:56:26.320 --> 3:56:31.040]  about the collective i'm an individualist i'm free but i do care about the collective so i'm
[3:56:31.040 --> 3:56:37.600]  always thinking about that so i'm thinking about me i'm thinking about how i was used as the precedent
[3:56:37.600 --> 3:56:45.680]  to get all this done and now it's being done and what is the senate gonna do
[3:56:47.280 --> 3:56:54.400]  when the deep state says you can't show a u.s senator in 2020 talking about
[3:56:56.640 --> 3:57:02.720]  a witness who we should be able to face as an accuser and now they've taken it down
[3:57:02.720 --> 3:57:08.480]  so i'll say this i don't think america is this wimpy i don't think america is this pathetic i
[3:57:08.480 --> 3:57:13.920]  don't think we're this bad i think they're good people in the u.s senate overall i think there's
[3:57:13.920 --> 3:57:18.160]  people in the government that understand this is dangerous and in private life and i believe
[3:57:18.160 --> 3:57:24.400]  that google and apple and all these jerk-off organizations that are so arrogant are going
[3:57:24.400 --> 3:57:29.520]  to get cut down to size because if i owned a company it wouldn't let a u.s senator give his
[3:57:29.520 --> 3:57:34.720]  speech i think i would get in trouble i would fear that but these people at google they just
[3:57:34.720 --> 3:58:00.320]  think they're invincible so it's in the senate's hands now
