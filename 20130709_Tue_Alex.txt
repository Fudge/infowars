[10:27.000 --> 10:31.440]  that's normally released they're saying they've been told not to release it gee
[10:31.440 --> 10:37.560]  told by who I can't tell you how many confirmed cases there are of police
[10:37.560 --> 10:41.920]  catch a plane on the tarmac usually at a small town airport there's been a lot
[10:41.920 --> 10:46.640]  of famous cases of this and it's a CIA aircraft with drugs on it or a CIA
[10:46.640 --> 10:51.800]  aircraft flying kids out of the country or people to be tortured I mean you name
[10:51.800 --> 10:57.920]  it it's evil they're doing it and there'll be a big standoff and the
[10:57.920 --> 11:01.680]  national security gets declared and then letters are issued to the police chief
[11:01.680 --> 11:07.880]  and the judges and they follow the orders and let them just go and that's
[11:07.880 --> 11:12.400]  exactly what's going on here as if the federal government and the shadow
[11:12.400 --> 11:17.840]  government that's hijacked it is God and ladies and gentlemen it is not God
[11:17.840 --> 11:23.280]  government and the corrupt bureaucracy that's taken over is not God there's
[11:23.280 --> 11:26.640]  one of those bombshell stories then there's this video and audio we're gonna
[11:26.640 --> 11:32.840]  play later that a listener sent us it's breaking on info wars calm and we ask
[11:32.840 --> 11:36.640]  the question you know here in the article is this the TSA and the answer is
[11:36.640 --> 11:43.280]  yes two years ago Paul Watson noticed on the TSA's own website training videos
[11:43.280 --> 11:49.200]  showing them at shopping malls in Florida and at football stadiums in
[11:49.200 --> 11:55.240]  Florida searching people well now this is San Antonio and folks they never tell
[11:55.240 --> 11:59.880]  you where they're gonna be they have this operation independence last July
[11:59.880 --> 12:05.160]  4th and over the weekend where they had TSA checkpoints in Austin in San
[12:05.160 --> 12:10.960]  Antonio in Dallas in Houston it all came out but it's up to citizens to
[12:10.960 --> 12:17.080]  videotape this and it's canine units with TSA on their shirts searching people
[12:17.080 --> 12:27.040]  at the mall TSA invades roads highways with viper checkpoints now again that's
[12:27.040 --> 12:34.360]  what we reported on last week now it's in San Antonio new article that came out
[12:34.360 --> 12:41.280]  last night on info wars calm TSA sniffing bags in Texas shopping mall we're
[12:41.280 --> 12:47.840]  going to be getting to that also we're going to be getting into the latest on
[12:47.840 --> 12:55.840]  the amnesty bill congressman says Obama jamming amnesty in the house killing
[12:55.840 --> 13:01.400]  any type of real reform and basically ignoring their oath of office a complete
[13:01.400 --> 13:06.160]  absolute criminal opening of the borders total legalization of anybody that
[13:06.160 --> 13:10.440]  wants to come here absolute welfare to people that have been here illegally the
[13:10.440 --> 13:19.600]  list goes on and on we're going to be getting into that report as well and then
[13:19.600 --> 13:25.160]  we've got a good article it's very informative from washington's blog up
[13:25.160 --> 13:30.000]  on info wars calm the fact that mass surveillance doesn't keep us safe goes
[13:30.000 --> 13:36.000]  mainstream and then he lists a bunch of articles mainstream articles where they
[13:36.000 --> 13:39.280]  admit well wait a minute we've had all the center in SA surveillance forever and
[13:39.280 --> 13:45.120]  it didn't stop all these terror events in fact you're even if the terror is real
[13:45.120 --> 13:48.600]  you've got a better chance of being killed by a honeybee or falling in your
[13:48.600 --> 13:53.160]  shower a bolt of lightning then terrorism why is this going on plus it
[13:53.160 --> 13:58.040]  doesn't protect us from the terrorism no it is the pretext and the excuse to
[13:58.040 --> 14:03.800]  take over our lives duh and I was thinking about all the new videos coming
[14:03.800 --> 14:09.760]  out of the TSA doing proctology exams pulling diapers off baby sticking their
[14:09.760 --> 14:16.360]  hands down women's pants they're they're they're back doing it for a few maybe
[14:16.360 --> 14:20.960]  six eight months or so the reports went down they backed off they would put kids
[14:20.960 --> 14:24.480]  through a different line now they're back doing it since everybody knows as soon
[14:24.480 --> 14:29.600]  as our resistance comes to a crescendo they back off so that we back off and
[14:29.600 --> 14:36.160]  they come right back and I'd say warfare technique used and we are under attack
[14:36.160 --> 14:40.040]  ladies and gentlemen by the globalist we're all being conditioned they're
[14:40.040 --> 14:45.320]  trying to sabotage our industry sabotage our jobs pay to ship our jobs
[14:45.320 --> 14:52.880]  overseas like they've done with General Motors and now I see the video new video
[14:52.880 --> 14:59.240]  in Texas and other states where the police pull you over and say I'm going
[14:59.240 --> 15:05.480]  to search the car and they search the car and then they say I'm gonna do a
[15:05.480 --> 15:11.920]  cavity search we played this video in audio yesterday and the women say you're
[15:11.920 --> 15:20.600]  joking they're like no and then they go into your pants and grab you and by the
[15:20.600 --> 15:26.160]  way two women one glove and I hate to get gross about this you know my wife said

[15:40.120 --> 15:44.880]  ones doing it I mean I have to illustrate it so that the nightmare stops
[15:44.880 --> 15:49.040]  I mean I got to tell you now I took my wife out to a movie last night went and
[15:49.040 --> 15:53.120]  picked my children up and my parents at about nine o'clock and I saw let me not

[18:24.680 --> 18:31.960]  mean completely insane completely wild-eyed and I guarantee if I'd have
[18:31.960 --> 18:38.320]  been rude he wouldn't have acted like that I did it as a test just and of course
[18:38.320 --> 18:41.280]  my phone was dead I hadn't charged it that was the other problems I didn't get
[18:41.280 --> 18:46.800]  it on video but it just shows the warped psychology and we know the police
[18:46.800 --> 18:50.240]  are out of control in China we know they're out of control in Russia we
[18:50.240 --> 18:54.600]  know they're out of control in Mexico and Venezuela and Nicaragua and Al

[24:03.160 --> 24:08.120]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central, we're here live.
[24:08.120 --> 24:13.080]  Fat weeknight, 7 o'clock central, in full wars and nightly news and every Sunday, 4
[24:13.080 --> 24:16.880]  to 6 p.m. central with the live Sunday transmission.
[24:16.880 --> 24:19.880]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[24:19.880 --> 24:24.480]  But getting back to this West Virginia video that we've had posted on infowars.com for
[24:24.480 --> 24:30.720]  the last week or so, we played it on the nightly news, we never played it here on the radio.
[24:30.720 --> 24:33.680]  He comes up to a warrantless checkpoint.
[24:33.680 --> 24:36.120]  They want to search his car, he says no.
[24:36.120 --> 24:38.720]  They say pull over there.
[24:38.720 --> 24:44.560]  I'm Yosemite Sam and then they dig through and laugh about the Constitution and that
[24:44.560 --> 24:45.560]  he knows he's right.
[24:45.560 --> 24:49.560]  He ain't done nothing wrong.
[24:49.560 --> 24:54.760]  And then you see the one cop, you're a radio listener, you can't see it, but the video
[24:54.760 --> 24:58.520]  is up on the side, he sees the camera.
[24:58.520 --> 25:07.480]  And by the way, we're studying and looking at a bunch of models right now of dash cams.
[25:07.480 --> 25:10.840]  We recommend for people to get to put in their car and do just what they did here.
[25:10.840 --> 25:16.760]  Now listen to him, he's searching the car illegally, no warrant, no probable cause at
[25:16.760 --> 25:33.000]  a giant checkpoint, right out of Nazi Germany, just digging through your car.
[25:33.000 --> 25:38.120]  But he's perfectly innocent and he knows his rights, he knows what the Constitution says.
[25:38.120 --> 25:43.960]  You got air pressure down to the sea, wasn't a very good alert.
[25:43.960 --> 25:48.040]  Uh oh, they see the camera and shut up now.
[25:48.040 --> 25:53.800]  He's like, hey look over there, there's a camera, oops, now he's shutting his light
[25:53.800 --> 25:54.800]  in it.
[25:54.800 --> 25:59.280]  And I love how cops pull you over and aggressively shove a light in your face.
[25:59.280 --> 26:03.720]  I mean, we put up with our kids being grown up at the airport, miss USA, they go in her
[26:03.720 --> 26:07.080]  body and she's crying and everybody just laughs.
[26:07.080 --> 26:12.280]  Because this is not what a free country does, America never acted like this and was the opposite
[26:12.280 --> 26:19.760]  of this, Nazi Germany didn't do stuff like this, they came and politely took you away.
[26:19.760 --> 26:23.000]  And it just goes on and on and this is really nothing.
[26:23.000 --> 26:28.240]  I've seen footage and put it in my film, Road to Tyranny, where the police find a pocket
[26:28.240 --> 26:35.120]  Constitution at a unconstitutional checkpoint and they begin hyperventilating in fear and
[26:35.120 --> 26:39.120]  arrest her for it, believing it's illegal.
[26:39.120 --> 26:43.040]  This is not a Monty Python satire.
[26:43.040 --> 26:44.040]  Is this legal?
[26:44.040 --> 26:45.040]  I don't know.
[26:45.040 --> 26:46.040]  Get a supervisor.
[26:46.040 --> 26:48.800]  It had George Washington, by the way, on the front of it.
[26:48.800 --> 26:56.000]  They get so scared by George Washington and I guess they should be that they begin hyperventilating.
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.440]  And I mean, I got to be honest with you, they're setting up more and more of these unconstitutional
[26:59.440 --> 27:04.960]  checkpoints, you pull up to them and used to they said, mind if I search and then you
[27:04.960 --> 27:09.600]  go, oh, no, sure, nothing illegal in your car.
[27:09.600 --> 27:13.480]  When you do that, they will put you on the side of the highway with fire ants crawling
[27:13.480 --> 27:19.760]  up your leg for an hour and will tear your car apart and will make you take your luggage
[27:19.760 --> 27:25.680]  out, make you take your spare tire out and then go, all right, you can go looking for
[27:25.680 --> 27:38.000]  drugs that on record, two banks laundered $378 billion of drug money from 2007 to 2009.
[27:38.000 --> 27:43.840]  Well, Covia Wells Fargo, you know, Warren Buffett, no one got in trouble.
[27:43.840 --> 27:47.840]  They were leasing the aircraft to fly the drugs, the money and the guns.
[27:47.840 --> 27:48.840]  They run it all.
[27:48.840 --> 27:54.040]  It's a $500 billion industry, one of the biggest in the U.S., one of the biggest in the world,
[27:54.040 --> 27:55.200]  just in the U.S.
[27:55.200 --> 28:00.760]  It's a giant business and then they're like, you know what we'll do, we'll make it illegal.
[28:00.760 --> 28:05.080]  This is 100 years ago or about 80 years ago and then when these idiots use it, we'll put
[28:05.080 --> 28:20.920]  them in our presence and it goes on and on and on and on and all the major banks do it.
[28:20.920 --> 28:26.560]  They run America and then you get these cops, imagine this, if you pull over to a group
[28:26.560 --> 28:31.920]  of cops sitting around talking and walk over and go, hello, officers, I think I'm going
[28:31.920 --> 28:34.520]  to do this here in Austin.
[28:34.520 --> 28:38.480]  I'm going to walk up with the camera and go, mind if I search your vehicle and I bet they're
[28:38.480 --> 28:41.800]  going to arrest me and probably think I'm going to do it to state police because they're
[28:41.800 --> 28:45.560]  about the most aggressive in Texas now and they're probably going to club my head and
[28:45.560 --> 28:46.560]  charge me with assault.
[28:46.560 --> 28:47.560]  I'm going to have a camera.
[28:47.560 --> 28:50.960]  I'm giving them fair warning, heading across the street, I'm going to burn them.
[28:50.960 --> 28:54.440]  I'm going to burn them good and that's the kind of stuff we need to start doing.
[28:54.440 --> 28:55.440]  Okay.
[28:55.440 --> 28:57.080]  It's time to get aggressive with this criminality.
[28:57.080 --> 29:05.800]  By the way, they had the head of the police union here in Austin come out and tell Antonio
[29:05.800 --> 29:10.680]  Beeler that he better stop filming police or something bad is going to happen.
[29:10.680 --> 29:11.680]  Something violent.
[29:11.680 --> 29:12.680]  What?
[29:12.680 --> 29:13.680]  Like Michael Hastings, maybe?
[29:13.680 --> 29:15.680]  Because you're in charge now, aren't you?
[29:15.680 --> 29:18.960]  You can do whatever you want, can't you?
[29:18.960 --> 29:23.680]  And again, I'm trying to note here the difference between constitutional police and what is
[29:23.680 --> 29:29.760]  taking over because imagine, I guarantee you, mind if I search your car, the cops are going
[29:29.760 --> 29:30.760]  to flip out.
[29:30.760 --> 29:35.240]  Well, how do you think we feel when you pull us over for something made up there and go,
[29:35.240 --> 29:40.680]  I'm going to search the vehicle and then next, I'm going to run my hand up your rear end.
[29:40.680 --> 29:41.680]  How's that sound?
[29:41.680 --> 29:43.680]  Do you like Land of the Free?
[29:43.680 --> 29:45.680]  Yeah, you brave?
[29:45.680 --> 29:48.680]  You don't stand up against me, American scum?
[29:48.680 --> 29:49.680]  No, you ain't.
[29:49.680 --> 29:50.680]  We're on the march.
[29:50.680 --> 29:53.200]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:53.200 --> 30:00.520]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.520 --> 30:03.960]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms.
[30:03.960 --> 30:07.920]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your
[30:07.920 --> 30:10.000]  arsenal for home protection.

[32:32.840 --> 32:38.360]  leave the silver at the surface, but rather we have formulated our silver gel using the
[32:38.360 --> 32:44.320]  natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin
[32:44.320 --> 32:47.320]  while delivering the silver more effectively.

[32:54.080 --> 32:56.080]  are best for you.
[32:56.080 --> 33:03.080]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[33:27.080 --> 33:28.680]  Alright folks, we are back live.
[33:28.680 --> 33:30.920]  I'm going to your phone calls and back in the news.
[33:30.920 --> 33:34.680]  By the way, there's another video in West Virginia that came out last week at a warrantless
[33:34.680 --> 33:35.680]  checkpoint.
[33:35.680 --> 33:42.840]  The particular one I was just talking about was Tennessee, where the deputies at the big
[33:42.840 --> 33:49.800]  checkpoint, the guy that won his car searched, and so they just said, get your butt right
[33:49.800 --> 33:51.800]  over there, boy.
[33:51.800 --> 33:56.280]  And again, this is what corrupt countries always do, but seeing now you're supposed
[33:56.280 --> 33:59.000]  to salute the police and actually bend over.
[33:59.000 --> 34:04.240]  And that was in Murphy's borough, Tennessee, and the Liberty Crier is linking through to
[34:04.240 --> 34:08.960]  a mainstream news article and reporting that on top of it, the particular deputy reportedly
[34:08.960 --> 34:13.400]  lied about having insurance when he rear-ended someone in his pickup truck.
[34:13.400 --> 34:19.280]  The file shows video, the DUI checkpoint in Rutherford County, already viewed by millions
[34:19.280 --> 34:23.920]  of times online, was recorded by a member of the Libertarian Party and raises questions
[34:23.920 --> 34:26.400]  about driver's rights at checkpoints.
[34:26.400 --> 34:27.840]  There's no questions.
[34:27.840 --> 34:32.520]  The Supreme Court, the state courts have all ruled that it's unconstitutional to have
[34:32.520 --> 34:34.120]  a warrantless checkpoint.
[34:34.120 --> 34:39.760]  You can have a checkpoint if there is a red pickup truck with a bank robber that matches
[34:39.760 --> 34:45.520]  a description believed to be going down Highway 10, and then they set it up looking for the
[34:45.520 --> 34:47.560]  red pickup.
[34:47.560 --> 34:51.520]  But now they use any excuse, fireworks got shot off.
[34:51.520 --> 34:53.240]  We think it might be a firearm.
[34:53.240 --> 34:57.880]  We're locking down 800 homes and searching them without warrants, totally illegal.
[34:57.880 --> 35:03.640]  We're looking for one kid who we say is the bomber, who they really wanted to get rid
[35:03.640 --> 35:04.640]  of.
[35:04.640 --> 35:06.280]  Look how many other witnesses they did in the Boston bombing.
[35:06.280 --> 35:13.680]  And then, boom, boom, they go and search everybody's houses without warrants.
[35:13.680 --> 35:16.600]  It's all a government orgy of power grab.
[35:16.600 --> 35:20.160]  Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts, absolutely.
[35:20.160 --> 35:23.640]  This has happened over and over and over again.
[35:23.640 --> 35:28.200]  If common criminals could use the same excuses as the Obama administration, they would say
[35:28.200 --> 35:29.680]  mistakes were made.
[35:29.680 --> 35:30.800]  What difference does it make?
[35:30.800 --> 35:32.360]  I know nothing.
[35:32.360 --> 35:33.880]  I did it for national security.
[35:33.880 --> 35:38.000]  I answered in the least untruthful manner possible.
[35:38.000 --> 35:47.080]  Yeah, the head of the NSA, General Alexander came out last week and said, I apologize to
[35:47.080 --> 35:48.080]  Congress.
[35:48.080 --> 35:55.600]  What I said was completely erroneous when he said to Congress, I heard them play that
[35:55.600 --> 36:02.520]  on the nightly news last Friday, we ought to queue up that clip that I saw them cover.
[36:02.520 --> 36:04.520]  It was an article on Info Wars as well.
[36:04.520 --> 36:07.400]  I think it was head of NSA admits to lying to Congress.
[36:07.400 --> 36:12.680]  But the point is, it's very powerfully goes, that statement could not have been more erroneous.
[36:12.680 --> 36:14.760]  We do spy on you without warrants.
[36:14.760 --> 36:17.560]  Well, of course you do.
[36:17.560 --> 36:21.520]  But see, they tried to have him go out and lie to see how it would work and they went,
[36:21.520 --> 36:23.800]  sir, no one is buying it.
[36:23.800 --> 36:26.200]  They all know you perjured yourself.
[36:26.200 --> 36:28.280]  Congress wants to act like they don't know what's going on because they're of the real
[36:28.280 --> 36:29.280]  criminals.
[36:29.280 --> 36:31.440]  Acting, oh, I know nothing as well.
[36:31.440 --> 36:36.200]  Oh, gee, we know nothing about the $500 billion in narcotics money each year made in the
[36:36.200 --> 36:38.200]  U.S. that's lining most of their pockets.
[36:38.200 --> 36:42.040]  Oh, gee, we don't know why we go to Congress worth a million and, you know, end up being
[36:42.040 --> 36:44.200]  worth $100, $200, $300 million.
[36:44.200 --> 36:47.440]  Gee, we don't know what's going on.
[36:47.440 --> 36:49.440]  We have no idea.
[36:49.440 --> 36:54.280]  Yeah, there's the headline, Intelligence Chief, the head of cybersecurity.
[36:54.280 --> 37:06.160]  Yes, I lied to Congress, but here's why I lied to you because I love you.
[37:06.160 --> 37:09.360]  He says, quote, it was clearly erroneous.
[37:09.360 --> 37:18.400]  So now we found the secret ingredient to exerroneous is James Clapper.
[37:18.400 --> 37:21.920]  But also Alexander has made similar statements.
[37:21.920 --> 37:23.520]  So there you go.
[37:23.520 --> 37:26.680]  I don't even know what to say anymore.
[37:26.680 --> 37:34.280]  I mean, listen, this is textbook wall to wall insane asylum, loony tune off the chart,
[37:34.280 --> 37:40.800]  bunker world, cuckoo cocoa puff, crazy insane tyranny going on.
[37:40.800 --> 37:46.440]  And now they're blowing up people's cars and saying, oh, we've been told by a name group
[37:46.440 --> 37:48.160]  to not release the police report.
[37:48.160 --> 37:49.880]  The police at least are going.
[37:49.880 --> 37:53.720]  We've been told not to give the media the police report.
[37:53.720 --> 37:54.720]  National security.
[37:54.720 --> 37:55.720]  They're after me.
[37:55.720 --> 37:57.120]  They're threatening to kill me.
[37:57.120 --> 37:58.120]  Biggest story ever.
[37:58.120 --> 37:59.120]  I'm about to break.
[37:59.120 --> 38:00.120]  I'm going off the radar.
[38:00.120 --> 38:01.120]  I'm going into hiding.
[38:01.120 --> 38:08.560]  Oh, there's nothing going on here.
[38:08.560 --> 38:09.560]  Everything's fine here.
[38:09.560 --> 38:10.560]  Nothing.
[38:10.560 --> 38:11.560]  Nothing to worry about.
[38:11.560 --> 38:12.560]  I'll send a squad.
[38:12.560 --> 38:13.560]  Oh, no, no.
[38:13.560 --> 38:14.560]  Actually, a major reactor.
[38:14.560 --> 38:15.560]  Very dangerous.
[38:15.560 --> 38:19.320]  I'm laughing about this.
[38:19.320 --> 38:21.040]  This is crazy.
[38:21.040 --> 38:22.840]  But America had so much liberty.
[38:22.840 --> 38:29.840]  There's still this vestigial skeletal structure of freedom and institutions that are left.
[38:29.840 --> 38:35.120]  But then you've got massive tyranny just growing like the blob at the end of the Steve McQueen
[38:35.120 --> 38:38.840]  movie, you know, the 1950s version, where it's eaten so many people now.
[38:38.840 --> 38:44.800]  It's the size of, you know, it's the size of the fire station coming down the street.
[38:44.800 --> 38:48.600]  And we've got to turn this around somehow.
[38:48.600 --> 38:54.200]  And again, I run into police and government people all over the country who are listeners
[38:54.200 --> 38:55.760]  and are aware and who are nice.
[38:55.760 --> 38:58.240]  And I see cops changing people's tires.
[38:58.240 --> 39:02.400]  In fact, I'm going to tell this story now and then go to your calls.
[39:02.400 --> 39:10.280]  In the last month, I had dinner with a family acquaintance over the years, an old family
[39:10.280 --> 39:11.280]  friend.
[39:11.280 --> 39:15.880]  But when I say acquaintance, we've known him over the years, but off and on.
[39:15.880 --> 39:21.840]  And I had dinner and he said, no, listen, we get basically in trouble when we go out
[39:21.840 --> 39:26.480]  and change tires and help old ladies, you know, carry the trash out and we're on a call.
[39:26.480 --> 39:30.360]  We're not supposed to basically help people, we're supposed to go out and write tickets
[39:30.360 --> 39:35.080]  all day and just be visible out there to the public.
[39:35.080 --> 39:39.280]  And there's so much petty crime going on, because criminals won't do home invasions in
[39:39.280 --> 39:40.800]  Austin, Texas.
[39:40.800 --> 39:45.760]  There's so much petty crime going on that there's just nothing we can even do.
[39:45.760 --> 39:48.120]  He goes, the numbers you talk about is higher than that.
[39:48.120 --> 39:54.320]  It's just wall to wall, cars being broken into, bicycles being stolen, but the home invasions
[39:54.320 --> 39:58.640]  aren't up that much because they're scared of guns.
[39:58.640 --> 40:02.200]  And then I was separately talking to a very old family friend, oldest family friends we've
[40:02.200 --> 40:04.080]  got.
[40:04.080 --> 40:08.600]  And one of the, the younger brother is a mailman.
[40:08.600 --> 40:12.520]  He's about to retire, but he's one of the younger siblings in the family we've been
[40:12.520 --> 40:17.520]  friends with since I was born in Dallas, but they live down here now.
[40:17.520 --> 40:20.600]  And he's a mailman in a town outside Austin.
[40:20.600 --> 40:21.600]  He's retiring in two years.
[40:21.600 --> 40:25.560]  By the way, they're already giving them IOUs on their pensions and telling them they're
[40:25.560 --> 40:26.760]  not going to get them.
[40:26.760 --> 40:33.240]  And he's almost been fired three times because he'll go to these shut-ins' houses and there's
[40:33.240 --> 40:35.000]  piled up trash.
[40:35.000 --> 40:40.440]  The old woman's in a wheelchair, her kids won't come see her and help her.
[40:40.440 --> 40:45.820]  They'll ask, hey, will you please help me carry my trash to the curb?
[40:45.820 --> 40:51.560]  And so they have spies, citizen spies and government spies watching the mailmen and
[40:51.560 --> 40:57.480]  it, so now he's sitting there going, I'm sorry, I can't, I can't open that can of
[40:57.480 --> 40:58.480]  peace for you.
[40:58.480 --> 41:02.600]  I'm sorry, I can't, I can't carry the trash out, even though it takes him five seconds
[41:02.600 --> 41:05.800]  to give her the mail and then carry the trash out the same distance.
[41:05.800 --> 41:06.800]  I can't help you.
[41:06.800 --> 41:08.760]  And he has to wear GPS.
[41:08.760 --> 41:13.920]  They all wear GPS now and the cops are going to get this too, where they can't be good.
[41:13.920 --> 41:20.600]  See, the government wants to promote the crazy foaming at the mouth, nuttoid cooks.
[41:20.600 --> 41:23.320]  Probably where I live is not that bad.
[41:23.320 --> 41:25.280]  The Travis County Sheriff's Department's not that bad.
[41:25.280 --> 41:30.440]  The Austin Police Department isn't that bad compared to the state police who didn't used
[41:30.440 --> 41:31.440]  to be that bad.
[41:31.440 --> 41:38.120]  But I mean, I see the mark difference where you have a, some weird checkpoint going on.
[41:38.120 --> 41:39.880]  You park your car, walk up, hey, what's going on?
[41:39.880 --> 41:43.880]  Get in your car and get out of here, you're just wanting to attack me.
[41:43.880 --> 41:46.580]  And I'm like, man, this is really a nut.
[41:46.580 --> 41:52.160]  This is really a dangerous lunatic who shouldn't have a badge, shouldn't have a gun.
[41:52.160 --> 41:55.760]  And the other state police were standing around, kind of embarrassed looking at him, like,
[41:55.760 --> 41:57.400]  ooh, why is he acting like that?
[41:57.400 --> 42:00.360]  But of course, he was the one in command.
[42:00.360 --> 42:05.800]  He was the one in charge and look, I'm, I'm 511 and I don't have a Napoleonic complex.
[42:05.800 --> 42:09.280]  I don't think of myself as really short, but I kind of walk around like a gorilla kind
[42:09.280 --> 42:11.080]  of bent over half the time now.
[42:11.080 --> 42:17.360]  Some people, you know, say, hey, you know, it was funny, Professor Rick goes, I like
[42:17.360 --> 42:18.360]  you.
[42:18.360 --> 42:19.360]  You're, you're, you're not too tall.
[42:19.360 --> 42:20.360]  He's a funny guy.
[42:20.360 --> 42:24.520]  Reminded me a time band that's where Napoleon's saying, little people, I like you.
[42:24.520 --> 42:28.440]  But the side issue, you have to see that film that I'm talking about.
[42:28.440 --> 42:30.720]  But this guy looked like he was about five, three.
[42:30.720 --> 42:35.560]  And I guess he had an issue with his Napoleonic shortness like Yosemite Sam and just blew
[42:35.560 --> 42:36.760]  up at me.
[42:36.760 --> 42:42.500]  And again, the science, I don't recommend you do this, but I am going to go out soon
[42:42.500 --> 42:45.400]  with a film crew.
[42:45.400 --> 42:48.160]  And I'm going to drive by, find a group of cops sitting around talking.
[42:48.160 --> 42:52.160]  I'm going to have the other car drive down a few hundred yards ahead of me, turn around
[42:52.160 --> 42:54.880]  to time it to pull up and park across the street, right?
[42:54.880 --> 43:01.120]  As I get out and walk over nicely and say, hi, officers, how's it going with a camera?
[43:01.120 --> 43:03.760]  And then go, mind if I search your vehicle?
[43:03.760 --> 43:06.600]  They're going to flip out on me.
[43:06.600 --> 43:12.120]  I guarantee you that half the cops out there will probably take me to jail.
[43:12.120 --> 43:15.280]  The other half will say, laugh at me and know who I am.
[43:15.280 --> 43:19.960]  But the point is, is that see how we've got the mindset so turned around.
[43:19.960 --> 43:23.160]  If you tried to randomly pull somebody over 50 years ago and say, I'm going to search
[43:23.160 --> 43:29.200]  your vehicle, they'd say, well, this is America, buddy, this ain't Russia.
[43:29.200 --> 43:34.200]  But now it's, I'm going to search your vehicle in this video with the two women coming from
[43:34.200 --> 43:40.080]  the beach in Galveston, up to Houston, and the male cops are like, I'm going to search
[43:40.080 --> 43:41.080]  your vehicle.
[43:41.080 --> 43:42.480]  They don't even ask.
[43:42.480 --> 43:45.760]  They search it and they go, all right, I'm going to do a cavity search.
[43:45.760 --> 43:49.600]  And these women are in bikinis and they're like, you're joking.
[43:49.600 --> 43:53.560]  The cop goes, I ain't joking with you, lady.
[43:53.560 --> 43:57.320]  And I'm telling you, folks, I'm telling you, the T.S.
[43:57.320 --> 44:01.400]  already does this to little kids, you're not sticking your finger in me.
[44:01.400 --> 44:03.680]  I'm just telling you right now.
[44:03.680 --> 44:09.480]  I mean, Jesse Ventura has basically left the country because of them grabbing his hind
[44:09.480 --> 44:10.480]  end.
[44:10.480 --> 44:11.480]  People go, oh, big deal.
[44:11.480 --> 44:12.480]  What's the big deal?
[44:12.480 --> 44:16.520]  If you do that to somebody in a park, you get like five years in prison and you should.
[44:16.520 --> 44:21.640]  I mean, when you go to the TSA folks, they run their hand up in your butt crack.
[44:21.640 --> 44:26.160]  I hate to talk about this on air, but this is, this is just, you know, scientific, you
[44:26.160 --> 44:27.840]  know, reporting here on what's going on.
[44:27.840 --> 44:31.480]  It's documentary, not meant for purposes of obscenity.
[44:31.480 --> 44:36.240]  You're going to notice while an NPR or PBS, sometimes they can have cussing and racist
[44:36.240 --> 44:38.160]  stuff on there because it's documentary.
[44:38.160 --> 44:39.360]  They're showing you what really happened.
[44:39.360 --> 44:46.040]  It's like if you're watching a trial on court TV and what was said is said.
[44:46.040 --> 44:52.400]  Just like when the defense lawyers for OJ Simpson, you know, were using the N word.
[44:52.400 --> 44:56.720]  The point is they were documenting what was being said, repeating what had been reported
[44:56.720 --> 44:57.720]  to be said.
[44:57.720 --> 44:59.040]  So, but I'm not even going to get graphic here.
[44:59.040 --> 45:06.560]  The point is Miss USA, they went in her pants and then into her body and how screwed up
[45:06.560 --> 45:07.560]  is it?
[45:07.560 --> 45:18.160]  These cops looking for marijuana, yeah, and there's the woman like kind of crying and
[45:18.160 --> 45:19.160]  freaking out.
[45:19.160 --> 45:26.880]  We just showed some video of it where she's like, I can't believe that this woman is like
[45:26.880 --> 45:32.720]  handcuffed and then they're going to imagine a woman's handcuffed and then cops are going
[45:32.720 --> 45:39.040]  to go in her body to see if she shoved a joint inside of herself.
[45:39.040 --> 45:40.040]  That's enough.
[45:40.040 --> 45:41.040]  I can't watch anymore.
[45:41.040 --> 45:42.040]  Just get it off the screen.
[45:42.040 --> 45:45.520]  Yeah, there's the footage of the other women in North Texas outside Dallas where the woman,
[45:45.520 --> 45:49.560]  you could see her, the woman cop, the other woman has a woman bend over and then shoves
[45:49.560 --> 45:51.480]  her hand in her.
[45:51.480 --> 45:55.600]  I mean, this is rape, ladies and gentlemen, but it's a cop doing it.
[45:55.600 --> 45:57.680]  So it's okay.
[45:57.680 --> 45:59.680]  I didn't mean to digress off into this.
[45:59.680 --> 46:01.080]  I know I did it yesterday.
[46:01.080 --> 46:07.960]  It's just, it's really starting to flip me out and it's all color law.
[46:07.960 --> 46:12.000]  Used to mind if I search, man, if you say, sure, go ahead, there you're going to be there
[46:12.000 --> 46:14.080]  an hour.
[46:14.080 --> 46:15.080]  It's a violet.
[46:15.080 --> 46:18.520]  Now it's just, I'm going to search and if you say you don't have a right, they pull
[46:18.520 --> 46:20.000]  a taser out and shoot you.
[46:20.000 --> 46:21.000]  I see this all the time.
[46:21.000 --> 46:25.080]  You've seen it.
[46:25.080 --> 46:29.560]  And if you try to resist being assaulted, imagine if they got your 10 year old daughter
[46:29.560 --> 46:32.280]  out and did this and you said, no, you're not, they'll taser you.
[46:32.280 --> 46:33.280]  You try to defend your daughter.
[46:33.280 --> 46:34.280]  They'll kill you.
[46:34.280 --> 46:35.280]  Your wife tries to defend.
[46:35.280 --> 46:36.440]  She's going to go six feet under.
[46:36.440 --> 46:41.120]  They're going to stick their hand in your hind end because that's their power.
[46:41.120 --> 46:42.560]  That's their domination.
[46:42.560 --> 46:49.680]  That's them showing you when it's an indicted criminal, merciless, offshore banking cartel
[46:49.680 --> 46:55.320]  that ships in the narcotics, runs the sex slavery, runs the gambling.
[46:55.320 --> 47:00.560]  They run it all, folks, and the police now, whether they know it or not, work for organized
[47:00.560 --> 47:02.480]  crime that hijacked America.
[47:02.480 --> 47:07.440]  I think that right now, the question is, do we all work for central bankers?
[47:07.440 --> 47:10.120]  That's what I want to address to our guests tonight.
[47:10.120 --> 47:12.240]  Is this global governance at last?
[47:12.240 --> 47:15.080]  Is it one world, the central bankers in charge?
[47:15.080 --> 47:20.440]  Jim Murio, you say we've got some downside here, a correction in the markets, fine.
[47:20.440 --> 47:24.040]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[47:24.040 --> 47:28.840]  Aren't we all just counting on the fact that there's a Bernanke put and that we won't go
[47:28.840 --> 47:32.440]  any lower than, say, 5% down from here?
[47:32.440 --> 47:36.040]  Of course we are because if we look at the economic data, there's nothing to get excited
[47:36.040 --> 47:37.040]  about in that.
[47:37.040 --> 47:42.080]  So yesterday we saw some reluctance for the Bernanke Fed to expand their balance sheets
[47:42.080 --> 47:43.200]  and pump more money in.
[47:43.200 --> 47:47.600]  But the stock market knows that reluctance is totally different than not willing to do
[47:47.600 --> 47:48.600]  it at all.
[47:48.600 --> 47:53.080]  And that's why we saw oil and oil implode and gold trade off heavily because they're
[47:53.080 --> 47:54.080]  not a protected class.
[47:54.080 --> 47:58.440]  If the stock market starts trading off in the 10% to 15% to 20% area, the chairman's
[47:58.440 --> 47:59.880]  going to come in and throw some stimulus at it.
[47:59.880 --> 48:04.160]  So to answer your question, we are absolutely slaves to central banks.
[48:04.160 --> 48:07.400]  We'd love to be slaves of the economy, but the economic numbers continue to do nothing
[48:07.400 --> 48:08.400]  but trend lower.
[48:08.400 --> 48:11.920]  Mr. LeCamp, do we work for the central bankers?
[48:11.920 --> 48:12.920]  Mr. LeCamp.
[48:12.920 --> 48:13.920]  No.
[48:13.920 --> 48:14.920]  This is a...
[48:14.920 --> 48:15.920]  There you go.
[48:15.920 --> 48:16.920]  We do.
[48:16.920 --> 48:17.920]  Look.
[48:17.920 --> 48:18.920]  That's CNBC.
[48:18.920 --> 48:19.920]  Folks, I know what I'm telling you sounds crazy.
[48:19.920 --> 48:23.000]  Doesn't what you know about the Soviet Union sound crazy, but it happened?
[48:23.000 --> 48:24.360]  Nazi Germany sounds crazy.
[48:24.360 --> 48:25.560]  It happened?
[48:25.560 --> 48:28.280]  All the hundreds of dictators you know about, it happened.
[48:28.280 --> 48:32.800]  I'm telling you, this is how it happens when people worship authority and do whatever
[48:32.800 --> 48:34.600]  it says.
[48:34.600 --> 48:39.120]  And I think about how we have this video that I saw get posted yesterday of a Toronto police
[48:39.120 --> 48:41.360]  officer helping a homeless woman.
[48:41.360 --> 48:44.120]  We just posted it on infoawards.com.
[48:44.120 --> 48:45.120]  Nobody's watching it.
[48:45.120 --> 48:47.000]  Nobody cares.
[48:47.000 --> 48:51.080]  Nobody wants to see it.
[48:51.080 --> 48:56.280]  And then when police act like humanitarians, they get in trouble in this country on average.
[48:56.280 --> 49:01.600]  Now, some departments are better, but that's because the system does not want the cops
[49:01.600 --> 49:02.880]  being friends with the people.
[49:02.880 --> 49:06.480]  They do not want a good relationship.
[49:06.480 --> 49:11.400]  They want an us against them militarized police against the general population.
[49:11.400 --> 49:16.160]  We're going to go to break and come back to John and Dominique and Michael and Nick and
[49:16.160 --> 49:17.160]  Peter.
[49:17.160 --> 49:20.320]  Michael wants to talk about Russian troops in America.
[49:20.320 --> 49:23.400]  We're going to get into all of that.
[49:23.400 --> 49:24.880]  And then I'll continue with the news.
[49:24.880 --> 49:29.960]  I haven't even gotten into some of the other insane news.
[49:29.960 --> 49:33.520]  Just briefly, we have the very best water filtration system.
[49:33.520 --> 49:34.960]  I did research for my family.
[49:34.960 --> 49:40.040]  I did research into the very best gravity fed portable, but also great in your office
[49:40.040 --> 49:41.880]  or restaurant or wherever.
[49:41.880 --> 49:45.160]  Gravity fed system that does tens of thousands of gallons before you have to replace the
[49:45.160 --> 49:46.440]  gravity fed filters.
[49:46.440 --> 49:49.280]  It's impregnated with colloidal silver and so much more.
[49:49.280 --> 49:54.680]  Look at the side-by-side comparisons in infoawards.com to the competition and annihilate some.

[53:33.320 --> 53:34.600]  never know it's there.
[53:34.600 --> 53:39.680]  Mazer instruments detect all forms of nuclear radiation, including alpha, beta, gamma and
[53:39.680 --> 53:40.680]  x-rays.
[53:40.680 --> 53:42.880]  And they're always on, just like your smoke alarm.
[53:42.880 --> 53:47.760]  Protecting, measuring and monitoring nuclear radiation, made in America, laboratory gray,
[53:47.760 --> 53:48.760]  and EMP resistant.
[53:48.760 --> 53:53.120]  If you can't reliably measure nuclear radiation, you're not fully prepared.
[53:53.120 --> 54:07.720]  But now you can be at Mazerinstruments.com, spelled M-A-Z-U-R instruments.com.
[54:07.720 --> 54:13.040]  There's a headline, Sheriff's Office to Pay One Million for Inmates of Death, and the
[54:13.040 --> 54:14.040]  banks love that.
[54:14.040 --> 54:15.560]  They run all these major cities.
[54:15.560 --> 54:19.680]  That'll just put people into deeper bankruptcy to the globalist.
[54:19.680 --> 54:20.680]  It's all fiat money.
[54:20.680 --> 54:25.320]  That's out of Tampa, Florida.
[54:25.320 --> 54:30.640]  It's a mistake at the Orient Road Jail in Hillsborough County, proved costly one million.
[54:30.640 --> 54:34.280]  That's how much the Sheriff's Office and the private company that provides medical care
[54:34.280 --> 54:38.080]  for inmates will pay to the family of 51-year-old Alan Hicks.
[54:38.080 --> 54:42.040]  The popular baseball coach died last year after suffering a stroke and spending 36 hours
[54:42.040 --> 54:44.480]  in the jail without treatment.
[54:44.480 --> 54:51.840]  Oh, that is sad, isn't it?
[54:51.840 --> 54:55.080]  That's just some of the news that's up on infowars.com.
[54:55.080 --> 55:00.160]  And again, can you imagine if you pulled up behind a cop and shined a spotlight on them
[55:00.160 --> 55:05.760]  and then said, pull over, they jump out and probably shoot you, or if a gang of 10 citizens
[55:05.760 --> 55:10.520]  came up to a police car and got around them and said, we want to search your vehicle.
[55:10.520 --> 55:13.240]  We think you might have done something.
[55:13.240 --> 55:15.100]  The cop would flip out.
[55:15.100 --> 55:16.520]  How do we put up with that?
[55:16.520 --> 55:19.160]  We're not criminals, but that's what America is now.
[55:19.160 --> 55:25.480]  That's what a tyranny is, where we're all scum and the government's gone.
[55:25.480 --> 55:28.200]  I'm going to go to your phone calls, and I'm going to continue right through the next hour
[55:28.200 --> 55:34.680]  with them, and then I'm going to get into heart-eating cannibal demands Obama send weapons.
[55:34.680 --> 55:39.520]  If we don't get help, no flies on heavy weapons, we will do worse than I did.
[55:39.520 --> 55:43.400]  You've seen nothing yet and promises to eat more hearts.
[55:43.400 --> 55:46.280]  These are people killing Christians and throwing them off rooftops.
[55:46.280 --> 55:49.120]  This is mainstream news, folks.
[55:49.120 --> 55:53.920]  This is who our government's supporting, because our government is cold-blooded offshore banks
[55:53.920 --> 55:57.760]  who know that even if the government gets brought down here, it'll just be the government.
[55:57.760 --> 55:58.760]  They're offshore.
[55:58.760 --> 56:00.800]  They've got diplomatic immunity.
[56:00.800 --> 56:03.760]  That's why things are getting so crazy, because they get away with anything.
[56:03.760 --> 56:09.040]  And if you study criminology, the criminal mindset, whether it's on the street or running
[56:09.040 --> 56:14.520]  a big bank, will always try to get caught and destroy itself, and will act out until
[56:14.520 --> 56:18.000]  it's brought down.
[56:18.000 --> 56:19.000]  Let's go to John in Illinois.
[56:19.000 --> 56:22.480]  You want to talk about the police state, which I've kind of been on a jag about the last
[56:22.480 --> 56:23.480]  few days.
[56:23.480 --> 56:24.480]  Go ahead.
[56:24.480 --> 56:28.040]  Alex, I'm a first-time caller, a 10-year listener.
[56:28.040 --> 56:29.040]  Welcome.
[56:29.040 --> 56:30.040]  Thank you.
[56:30.040 --> 56:31.640]  And I wanted to call and basically share a quick story.
[56:31.640 --> 56:36.080]  I had been caught up in an online check scam where I received a rubber check.
[56:36.080 --> 56:38.560]  I had to make a police report about this.
[56:38.560 --> 56:41.560]  And so I called the local police department here in Champaign, Illinois, and I was sitting
[56:41.560 --> 56:44.720]  outside on my porch with my laptop and all the records I needed.
[56:44.720 --> 56:46.400]  This officer pulled up.
[56:46.400 --> 56:51.080]  He sat behind my car for about 20 minutes and ran my plate and everything in full view
[56:51.080 --> 56:55.920]  with me, then finally got out, came up to the car with his hand on his gun, a really
[56:55.920 --> 56:56.920]  big tattooed.
[56:56.920 --> 56:58.760]  You could tell he was ex-military.
[56:58.760 --> 57:03.600]  And he was basically talking down to me before he even asked me what I had called him for.
[57:03.600 --> 57:04.600]  I know.
[57:04.600 --> 57:05.600]  It's all trend.
[57:05.600 --> 57:07.760]  Well, you're a Fallujah resident.
[57:07.760 --> 57:12.640]  He was basically demanding my ID, and I explained to him my children are inside asleep.
[57:12.640 --> 57:13.640]  I'd rather not.
[57:13.640 --> 57:16.280]  He asked me if there was something I was hiding from him inside.
[57:16.280 --> 57:20.560]  I told him I didn't think my children would appreciate waking up to a six-foot robot with
[57:20.560 --> 57:22.520]  a gun in my living room.
[57:22.520 --> 57:24.600]  And at that, he kind of chuckled, and he eased off.
[57:24.600 --> 57:26.360]  He followed my report.
[57:26.360 --> 57:29.800]  And basically, after he followed the report, at the end, he was saying, if anything on
[57:29.800 --> 57:30.800]  the...
[57:30.800 --> 57:33.240]  I didn't hang up on you, John.
[57:33.240 --> 57:35.240]  You got somebody calling.
[57:35.240 --> 57:36.240]  You want to take that call?
[57:36.240 --> 57:37.240]  Oh, no.
[57:37.240 --> 57:38.240]  Thank you.
[57:38.240 --> 57:42.040]  He said, basically, if anybody is offering you anything online at the scam, and a sucker
[57:42.040 --> 57:47.800]  is born every day, at this, I brought up how he is losing his pension fund, and he stopped
[57:47.800 --> 57:51.800]  for a moment and said that they have conspiracy theorists in the department like everywhere
[57:51.800 --> 57:52.800]  else.
[57:52.800 --> 57:54.360]  But he would have to look into this.
[57:54.360 --> 57:55.880]  I told him it's all over the internet.
[57:55.880 --> 57:56.880]  Take a look.
[57:56.880 --> 57:57.880]  Later on that night, I...
[57:57.880 --> 57:58.880]  Yeah.
[57:58.880 --> 58:02.040]  He was more civil with me.
[58:02.040 --> 58:06.640]  Yeah, you want to flip over and talk to that person real quick?
[58:06.640 --> 58:08.800]  There's no other call coming in.
[58:08.800 --> 58:09.800]  Oh, okay.
[58:09.800 --> 58:10.800]  But...
[58:10.800 --> 58:12.240]  Anyways, later on that night...
[58:12.240 --> 58:16.440]  I thanked him for, you know, basically becoming more civil with me.
[58:16.440 --> 58:19.160]  At the next day, he showed up to my wife's job.
[58:19.160 --> 58:23.320]  She's a leasing manager at an apartment with a drunk woman was acting violent.
[58:23.320 --> 58:28.680]  He basically neutralized the situation, was very convivial, he was comical, he escorted
[58:28.680 --> 58:29.680]  her back to her house.
[58:29.680 --> 58:30.680]  No, no.
[58:30.680 --> 58:33.680]  We need to engage these police because no one is ever...
[58:33.680 --> 58:38.120]  Everyone grovels to them, and if you grovel, it automatically turns them into predators.
[58:38.120 --> 58:39.120]  It's animal psychology.
[58:39.120 --> 58:50.240]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:50.240 --> 58:54.120]  Are we choosing our own destiny, or has it been pre-selected for us?
[58:54.120 --> 58:58.240]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential
[58:58.240 --> 58:59.640]  of information.
[58:59.640 --> 59:06.560]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your
[59:06.560 --> 59:07.560]  psyche.
[59:07.560 --> 59:13.120]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in
[59:13.120 --> 59:16.720]  perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[59:16.720 --> 59:21.440]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying
[59:21.440 --> 59:23.440]  it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[59:23.440 --> 59:26.840]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[59:26.840 --> 59:31.800]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse
[59:31.800 --> 59:33.800]  but demand a war.
[59:33.800 --> 59:40.280]  A state of mind, because there's a war on for your mind.
[59:40.280 --> 59:46.000]  Get your copy of State of Mind the Movie at infowars.com, and remember, every order at

[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:09.720]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:10.720]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:19.520]  Well, so does he, he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin,
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:24.520]  Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:43.240]  All right, I said I'd take your questions, and so we'd have wildcard points that have
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:47.000]  brought up, and the last caller was telling the story, which is fine too, but we're taking
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.720]  first-time callers right now, I want to take a ton of your calls, I'm going to try my best,
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:57.120]  and then I'm going to get to this story, I saw this a few days ago, but then looked at
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:02.560]  the video closer, and these people are serious, pro-abortion activists at the Texas Capitol
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:06.840]  where they're having a big battle, where Texas is trying to ban partial birth abortion.
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:12.280]  I mean, why not, it's easier to just deliver the baby, and then just give it up for adoption.
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:14.240]  These are survivable babies.
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:19.760]  This is clear murder, and the left is acting like it's their new civil rights crusade.
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:27.040]  They go up to harass the pro-lifers in shant, hail Satan, hail Satan, and I got to be honest
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:34.040]  with you folks, I've protested abortion clinics years ago, you're on that like 18 years ago,
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:37.760]  and I would have people come over and say things like this to me, so you got to understand
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:42.600]  there are Satanists, and these are holy facilities, that's why it's come out with a lot of them.
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:50.000]  You can look this up, where abortionists, a lot of times it turns out are actually Satanist.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  That's the pro-lifer speaking on the sub-box, and the people are around her chaining, hail
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  Satan.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:27.400]  And again, listening to it on the radio, you can go watch the video, you have to listen
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.720]  carefully, but the news reporter they were saying, hail Satan, if you listen, it's like
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:37.160]  a church, they're going, hail Satan, hail Satan, hail Satan, because they sure do it
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.600]  quite well at their meetings.
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.120]  Let's go ahead and talk to Peter.
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.120]  Peter, what's your question?
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:43.120]  Go ahead.
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.120]  Hey, Alex.
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.120]  Yes, sir.
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:52.240]  Hey, I just want to thank you for your great show that you've always put on.
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:59.000]  I'm a first-time caller, been listening to you for about three years, and one of the things
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:08.760]  I want to say was, you know, you sometimes bring up your faith on the show, and you are
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:17.720]  one of the reasons I went back to God, and because of the reasons, the fact that you
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:24.400]  showed everybody that we're free people to do what we want, and I want to thank you for
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:25.400]  that, Alex.
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:26.900]  Well, thank you.
[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:32.400]  The difference is, I'm not a Pharisee praying in public and up on the hill and beating people
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:38.560]  over the head with the man-made twisted garbage they put out, but the truth is, there are
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:43.280]  spiritual forces in this world of good and evil, and the globalists don't want you to
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:47.400]  be aware of that because if you're not aware of it, you're basically spiritually blind,
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.920]  they can enslave you.
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:49.920]  Correct.
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:58.200]  I mean, I have been so woken up by the sobering facts that come out of your show that how
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:04.960]  could you not realize that there is a war in our souls between good and evil?
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:12.760]  And we have to step up, realize that God is real, and we have to give Him the praise for
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:15.560]  all our battles that we do.
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:23.680]  Sure, but at the same time, give praise not to these establishment churches that tell
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.680]  you worship the government.
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:27.760]  They now have turned God into the government.
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:32.160]  I mean, you go to most of these churches, you get a sermon on licking boots all day,
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:36.560]  and probably they'll explain to you that it's of the Lord to bend over and have them do
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:38.360]  proctology exams.
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:42.960]  Most churches now teach the Christians were wrong to not worship idols and to be thrown
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:43.960]  to the lions.
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:51.200]  You type that in, preacher teaches Christians should have done what Caesar said and not been
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:52.200]  thrown to lions.
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:55.040]  I mean, it is, these aren't demons, a bunch of them.
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:56.040]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:00.640]  Thank you so much for the call.

[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:06.640]  Nature regularly sends us destructive storms.
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:09.640]  24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic.
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:13.080]  It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve.
[01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:18.280]  The food price storm from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights

[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:33.000]  Currently in the Mike Adams story, it's a great story, but it's not extremely audible
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  on the radio.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.040]  We just found a bunch of clips, because I heard them on the radio locally a few days
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:43.400]  ago, where the women run up and demonically stick their tongues out and scream Hail Satan
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:50.760]  at Christians that had gotten their time in the Capitol open air rotunda to pray for
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:53.600]  the babies they're killing.
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:09:01.780]  The Democrats, again just screaming over and over again, Hail Satan and sticking their
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:02.780]  tongues out.
[01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:06.880]  Yeah, back that up about 30 seconds, and let's play that so people can hear them.
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:19.520]  Just first, it starts with a loving chant of the Christians singing.
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:33.760]  We're singing Amazing Grace, and outside are people ringing, chanting Hail Satan, and then
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:39.520]  women run through the police to stick their tongues out.
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:40.520]  Hail Satan.
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:44.600]  Now, let me tell you something, ladies, you better back out of Satan real quick, because
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:49.200]  I know the TV tells you that's how you get power, and it's cute and funny.
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:54.680]  You're going to be begging, begging for God's help soon enough, and believe me, Satan is
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:57.520]  not going to answer your call.
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:00.800]  Satan will only give you limited temporal power to suck you in.
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:05.520]  It's like a bait, a lure that looks like a tasty fish or a tasty worm, but it's got
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:13.040]  hooks in it, and the woman with just an absolute Jezebel spirit running around with her tongue
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:18.040]  out and encircling the Christians, just chanting Hail Satan, Hail Satan.
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:23.880]  Now, here's the article by Mike Adams at infowars.com and naturalnews.com.
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:28.960]  Abortion activist caught on camera possessed by spooky Hail Satan chant at Texas State
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:29.960]  Capitol.
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:36.480]  Yeah, and the video he's got is when they're chanting low, Hail Satan, Hail Satan, Hail
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:42.400]  Satan, which is the real way it's done, by the way, and this is the real deal.
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:46.400]  You may have heard that Texas is seeking to outlaw late-term abortions, the kind of abortions
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:50.760]  that kill an early full-grown baby who has eyes, ears, hands, a beating heart, and can
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:53.840]  experience pain, and the babies fight the knife.
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:56.960]  That's why there's famous online videos of that.
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:59.360]  They don't want you seeing those.
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:07.520]  The idea that such pre-born human beings cannot be murdered at will infuriates pro-choice
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:11.400]  abortion activists, and the true inspiration for their desire to kill babies has finally
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.400]  emerged.
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:17.800]  This bizarre, almost creepy video has surface revealing pro-abortion activists chanting Hail
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:21.320]  Satan in unison at the Texas State Capitol.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:25.000]  As you can hear for yourself in the video below, people in the background again chanting
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:30.120]  Hail Satan during the speech of a woman who opposes late-term abortions.
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.760]  It appears at 5.12 in the video.
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:34.000]  See, Mike has one video where they're chanting.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  We found a bunch.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.800]  This is what they chant in the rotunda at the legislature as they try to ban it.
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:46.960]  So we're going to add a bunch of videos to Mike Adams' thing so you can see hours of
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:51.960]  Hail Satan if you'd like, and some will say, oh, they're just joking, yeah, no, they're
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:54.480]  not just joking.
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:59.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, why do you think they're sexualizing children at age five?
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:03.240]  Why do you think Nickelodeon four years ago came out and said, we're going to sexualize
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:05.040]  pre-teens?
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:08.880]  Why do you think you go to the store and the clothes for young girls looks like something
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:13.600]  that a prostitute would wear because they're on record saying they will wreck the innocence.
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:15.680]  They don't want children to be able to develop.
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:17.360]  They want to wreck them early.
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:21.440]  And all the studies show single family three to four times more likely to be in jail or
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:23.940]  on drugs.
[01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:27.080]  You don't live as long.
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:33.320]  If you aren't taught basic morals, then you will basically put up with anything.
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:41.080]  And so that's why these are sickos, they get the thrill of corrupting people.
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:53.360]  I mean, I've had the experience before in Hollywood where people basically explain that
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:55.840]  the fun is corrupting somebody.
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:59.320]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:06.280]  And these people aren't even trying to set you up in something.
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:15.720]  You know, women, whatever, it's just the fact that if you're a married man, they want you
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:20.000]  to cheat on your wife because that's fun to break up a family.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.840]  And then it just goes downhill from there.
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:23.680]  And these people have nothing.
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:26.080]  They get into evil and it doesn't fulfill them.
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:33.560]  So they think if I get into more evil, it's going to fulfill me.
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:34.720]  I said I'd go to your phone calls.
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:35.720]  We're going to go to them.
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:40.880]  But here's another article at info wars.com IVF designer babies and three parent babies
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:42.720]  raise serious ethical questions.
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:44.220]  Think so.
[01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:47.600]  Will these even be classic humans as we know them?
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:52.000]  And they're introducing chemicals and biologicals in the environment where we're not going to
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.120]  be able to have traditional children soon.
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:57.280]  And then you'll have to go to the government to have your designer baby made.
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:03.160]  That's always been the plan, according to Julian Huxley at the United Nations, the head
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:05.840]  of UNESCO.
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:13.920]  This is beyond anything the average person can even imagine.
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:15.720]  Let's go to Dominic in Texas.
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:16.720]  You're on the air.
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:17.720]  Go ahead.
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:18.720]  Hi, Alex.
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:19.720]  Hey, buddy.
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:24.720]  First time caller, a long time listener, I want to ask you about the FEMA camps, the
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:26.120]  10th city in Raymondville.
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:31.200]  I believe you passed through here one time when you were going on 77 back to Austin and
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:36.080]  you passed one of those imperial checkpoints that's illegally 100 miles in the border of
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:37.080]  Texas.
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:38.080]  Yes.
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:40.400]  What can you tell me about those?
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:44.400]  Well, I mean, they have the Constitution free zone 100 miles into the country.
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:46.960]  They let the drugs and the illegals through.
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:50.120]  It's only there for slave training to shake down US citizens.
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:54.320]  The border patrol has been on record basically admitting that and complaining about it because
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:57.520]  they like to actually protect the country's border.
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:03.920]  And under Rex 84 that was declassified in 1986 in the Iran Contra hearings, they built
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:08.800]  FEMA centers under the guise of keeping immigrants, which they prime the pump with.
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:13.520]  But under the civilian inmate labor camp program and the model states health emergency powers
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:18.800]  act and the emergency centers establishment act.
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:23.120]  Those are the official FEMA centers that they admit are for the American people.
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:26.920]  But John Corzine will not face criminal charges over MF global.
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:30.320]  They did a fake federal lawsuit just to act like they were going to do something as we
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:32.200]  predicted.
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:35.360]  And now nothing will be done to him stealing millions of dollars.
[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:37.080]  The former head of Goldman Sachs.
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:40.400]  This is the type of garbage we're talking about, sir.
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:41.400]  That's just crazy.
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:43.160]  I mean, they're militarizing the police.
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:46.760]  They've got cameras all over the city and in the city park now it's just it's getting
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:47.760]  crazy.
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:52.840]  No, no, they admit it is a Pentagon designed DARPA designed grid and we are the enemy that
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:53.840]  this is.
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:57.440]  And again, they're just finding what cops and military will follow the orders and they're
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:02.440]  conditioning us to put up with anything and preparing to push us until a civil war breaks
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:03.440]  out.
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:10.080]  Well, that's just that's all I have to say, I was God bless you, sir.
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:16.000]  Yeah, and again, I don't think people are cowards out there.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  If you hear what I talk about and then get scared, there's no hope for you.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:27.440]  You should get concerned and then fight back politically very aggressively.
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:29.360]  And there's a thousand different things to do.
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:30.640]  This will not make it through.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:31.640]  Hey, here's the good news.
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:40.040]  We warn people over 100 million guns have been sold on record in the last five years.
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:43.920]  Over 100 million billions of rounds of ammo have been purchased.
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:46.880]  Citizens are training everywhere.
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:50.760]  A lot of people in government are waking up and joining the awakening.
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:54.200]  So we're not going to be caught flatfoot in any of this.
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:55.840]  The Liberty Movement has done its job.
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:17:00.000]  We're intensifying operations, even though it's dangerous to my own person.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.080]  I don't I'm 110% committed.
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:07.400]  I am absolutely ramming the enemy at point blank range, savaging them most viciously with
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:10.240]  the truth as I can, not holding anything back.
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:14.080]  I told you a year ago that I've been holding back and I said, I'm going to the next level.
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:20.680]  I'm committing to it 110% and that's what we're trying to do here.
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:22.760]  Because only the truth will set us free.
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:25.400]  Only admitting how sick this is will set us free.
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:27.720]  Let's talk to Nick in New Jersey.
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:28.720]  You're on the year.
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:29.720]  Go ahead.
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:30.720]  Hi, Alex.
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:31.720]  Quick question.
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:37.560]  With the rising cost of student loans and the diminishing job market in America, in your
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:43.720]  opinion, is it worth paying for a college education these days or is it a waste of money?
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:49.720]  No, except for a very few highest scoring people who then join the right fraternity.
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:54.880]  You have to do that on top of it and who make all the right moves.
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:58.640]  College is completely, absolutely worthless now unless you're sending your daughter to
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:02.120]  a sorority to marry into another rich family.
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:08.360]  It is absolutely worthless unless it's squeezing the produce to see who you want to get married
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:09.440]  to.
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:21.560]  College is only good for social reasons to continue elite or nouveau rich breeding.
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:25.440]  Even the wealthier breaking down and your daughter will just rebel and run off and marry
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:29.880]  some criminal and get tattoos all over her face.
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:33.360]  It's absolutely worthless and they admit it's a total fraud bubble.
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:35.240]  It was all designed that way.
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:36.720]  There will be no jobs.
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:40.920]  There will be no jobs allowed unless you go to college to work for Homeland Security
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:45.840]  and to get a Homeland Security grant or scholarship and then even that after they're done with
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:48.120]  a takedown, you won't get your pension.
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:50.120]  So no, it's completely worthless.
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:53.640]  Well, I'm already 27 years old.
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:54.640]  I have a job.
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:58.240]  I have a couple of college degrees, but what would you recommend for students that are
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:01.080]  just leaving high school at this point?
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:06.040]  What would you, what's the good thing for them to do to get into at this point just
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:07.040]  for the young people?
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:13.680]  I mean, if you just go to college for a semester as a guy to try to marry a rich girl, that's
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:15.960]  a reason to go to college.
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:18.240]  Women marrying rich guys, that's the reason to go.
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:23.200]  Like I said, if you can get in an elite fraternity because that's how those things work, then
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:27.080]  you can get a job at an elite operation if you're smart.
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:31.040]  It's not enough to just have good grades.
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:34.780]  I don't know, the best job would probably be joining the police department and becoming
[01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:37.200]  a narcotics trafficker.
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:39.280]  Or you could join DineCord and run children.
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:43.120]  I mean, that's probably some of the only, you could join Homeland Security.
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:47.520]  If you want to engage in criminal activity, kidnap children, ship narcotics, torture
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:51.800]  people worldwide, pull children's teeth out, rape them in front of their parents, DHS is
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:52.800]  hiring.
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:57.000]  So stay there, I'll come back to you in just a minute, stay with us.

[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:03.920]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:08.120]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:09.120]  to serve as debt.
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:12.640]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:15.920]  currency, is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army.
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:19.520]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:23.000]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.400]  It's time to understand the system.
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:29.360]  Call 800-686-2237, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:33.480]  When you need it the most, will your generator, power equipment or vehicle be ready?
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:38.120]  Gas and diesel fuels go bad quickly when stored, and more than half of generator failures during
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:40.960]  disasters occur as a result of expired fuel.
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:44.960]  PRI fuel stabilizers keep your fuel fresh for when you need it most.
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:50.040]  Nuclear power stations, emergency service providers, and Ships at Sea rely on PRI fuel
[01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:51.040]  stabilizers.
[01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:52.040]  And you can too.
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:59.760]  Call 888-776-9373 or visit priproducts.com to find the dealer nearest you.
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:05.200]  There's a huge and hushed up conspiracy going on that's about to turn your lives upside
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:07.560]  down in the coming few months.
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:11.160]  Unbelievably, the media are keeping quiet about this.
[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:15.240]  I'm sure they know it, but they probably know that revealing it on TV will generate
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:18.000]  mass hysteria and chaos.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.480]  But I believe you should be informed about it, because when the sinister agenda is finally
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:27.760]  accomplished and everything unravels, only those who know this secret info will survive
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:29.160]  and thrive.
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:34.040]  Go to 123conspiracy.com right now to see the truth.
[01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:41.160]  The video at 123conspiracy.com reveals the real, secret reason why Obama is after your
[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:42.760]  guns and ammo.
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:49.040]  And it's not just in response to mass murders preparing for war, it's something much darker.
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:54.640]  Go watch the video now at 123conspiracy.com before they shut it down.
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:24:21.040]  And again, that's 123conspiracy.com.
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:35.800]  Yeah, the full clip is up on infowars.com.
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:39.560]  Let's back that up and play that clip a little bit longer clip of it in a moment.
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:44.760]  Fox News panel laughs at the idea that government should fear the people.
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:54.040]  Yeah, that's what Al Sharpton, but also people like Wrangel have got up this year and said,
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:55.600]  listen, forget your second amendment.
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:59.280]  Doesn't matter if it was designed to protect you from a bad government.
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:00.640]  We've got the drones.
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:01.880]  We got the army.
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:06.840]  And there isn't anything you white people in the South, you cracker heads are going
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:07.840]  to do.
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:13.400]  I mean, you can go find the clips, again, making it racial.
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:16.160]  And it's only racist whites that want guns.
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:20.840]  And it's the Ku Klux Klan that wants guns in the NRAs, the new Ku Klux Klan.
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:26.040]  These are quotes, by the way, a composite of quotes, one of the quotes about the NRAs,
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:27.840]  the Ku Klux Klan.
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:33.920]  That was a Fox sports writer and again, they're invoking race through white people, black
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:39.680]  people, you name it to try to get us fighting with each other.
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:44.800]  And this is the insane-ness of all of it.
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:51.040]  This is the craziness of it all that you're going to resist the government.
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:52.040]  No, you're not.
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:57.240]  You know, when I talk about DHS that hired the jail guards and certified them private
[01:25:57.240 --> 01:26:02.560]  jail guards to go run Abu Ghraib under the army, where the army's own report said what
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:09.800]  I just said before the break, torturing children, including sexually.
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:11.880]  And then they did it at camps all over the world.
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:16.240]  And then I mentioned Dinecourt and the Chicago Tribune and congressional hearings running
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:22.200]  giant sex trade operations, including children with stuff I'm not even going to say on air
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:24.200]  and no one got in trouble.
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:27.040]  Did you hear me yesterday?
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:31.440]  Last night I happened to accidentally hit the free iPhone app on my phone as I was getting
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:38.400]  bed at about midnight and heard my show start playing, rebroadcasting off the earbuds by
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:39.400]  the bedstand.
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:45.480]  So I popped in and listened for about 10 minutes and I was talking about here in Austin, I
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:53.080]  don't know, eight, nine years ago, I forget, my son was about two, this was about eight
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:58.520]  years ago, and I had him in for a checkup.
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:03.240]  And he goes, you know, I listened to your show, this is a big clinic, one of the biggest
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:08.520]  pediatricians, not even an anti-vaccine pediatrician, just one that won't harass you.
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:17.680]  They have on their website, you know, we, you know, do take patients that don't vaccinate.
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:24.240]  And he told me, no, they give people in Austin at the free clinics, live, illegal SV 40 virus.
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:25.640]  And he said, you know, that's illegal.
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:30.480]  It's been banned since 1962, and I said, I know, he goes, I know, but I said, well, you
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:31.480]  need to go public.
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:36.200]  He goes, no, no, no, no, and grab my arm and said, I just told you that off record, buddy.
[01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:40.200]  Just like doctor, patient privilege, journalist, source privilege.
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:45.560]  I go, I know, because you can tell people, a doctor told you, you go investigate it.
[01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:48.200]  And I called the health department and they said, oh, we'll get back with you.
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:52.600]  I mean, folks, these are sick people.
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:28:00.200]  Just like it was in the news yesterday in the local TV station's headline that they
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:07.120]  forcefully sterilized women in California presence up until 2010.
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:14.000]  They always say up until two years ago, it's folks, it's happening everywhere.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:18.480]  They sterilize a lot of children that CPS grab.
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:22.960]  I remember having a CPS worker on it with a whistle five years ago was in New York Daily
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:23.960]  News.
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:29.520]  I got her on to never get her back on again because of threats.
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:34.800]  And the woman was crying saying, I thought we were good.
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:35.840]  I thought we were good.
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:40.600]  But how they would go get the young black kids and take them mainly black because nobody
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:43.880]  stands up for black people because their black leadership just wants to fight white people
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:44.880]  all day.
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:47.760]  Nobody talked about the real stuff going on and how they would take little black kids
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:54.680]  and chain them down six, seven, eight year olds and feed them pesticides till they died
[01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:57.680]  in private facilities.
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:58.680]  Nobody's going to help them.
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:28:59.760]  Nobody's coming to help them.
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:04.600]  Nobody's coming to help anybody because America is a demonic cesspit.
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:05.920]  Nobody's going to help the 53 million babies.
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:06.920]  They already killed.
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:07.920]  Nobody's going to help the millions more.
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:10.880]  They're just going to dance around and say, hell Satan all day.
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:15.640]  It's just fun to say, hell Satan and it's powerful and nobody's going to come help
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:22.800]  all of you running around saying, hell Satan either until we wake up and repent as a nation.
[01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:26.760]  But I was hearing what I was saying and I'm like, man, this sounds so crazy.
[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:28.720]  But then I knew it was all true.
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:34.520]  Just like I just talked about New York Daily News reports about them killing kids and pesticide
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:37.440]  test and nobody gets in trouble.
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:38.760]  Nobody goes to jail.
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:41.640]  They just, you know, the whistleblower exposes something.
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:45.360]  They just blow their car up or have the police raid their offices.
[01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:47.400]  That was in the news yesterday.
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:49.760]  Just unbelievable, unbelievable.
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:51.040]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:53.520]  The empire's on the run.

[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:19.480]  I disagree with him just saying get rid of the U.S. government completely we don't have
[01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:23.320]  a U.S. government I keep trying to explain that to him so we're going to have kind of

[01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:03.480]  you can tell folks I really like the work he does Paul Joseph Watson Paul this is really
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:09.680]  getting crazy your article up on info wars dot com police firefighters order not to speak
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:16.320]  about mice lacing scratch LAPD refuses to release police report to journalists I mean why not
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:20.760]  I mean it's normal brand new Mercedes just blow up in the middle of the road I mean you know
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:26.480]  I mean hey it did you know the rider truck in Oklahoma City actually was speeding and
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:31.400]  ran to the building did you know that yeah that was that wasn't even a car bomb either
[01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:37.480]  Oklahoma City was not a car bomb folks Kennedy was hit by a net Paul Watson hi Alex good
[01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:44.600]  to be back yeah this is Kimberly Dvorak who's a journalist out of San Diego six news basically
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:50.320]  she went to Los Angeles to speak with the LAPD speak with the fire department involved
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:55.680]  in the response and investigation to the crash involving Rolling Stone journalist Michael
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:40:01.240]  Hastings last month and was basically told even though they ruled it out they ruled out
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:05.480]  foul play days after the incident she was told we're not going to give you the police
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:11.680]  report and she was also told by firefighters and cops they've been ordered not to speak
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:19.080]  to the media about the Michael Hastings crash in addition well yeah exactly and they were
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:26.040]  like the coroner who was over the Breitbart thing who got poisoned and died oh yeah nothing
[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:33.720]  to see here move along in addition Mercedes have come out and said that this inferno
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:40.120]  that consumed Hastings car which vehicle automotive experts have said is virtually impossible
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:45.480]  for a new brand new Mercedes Mercedes have also said that they don't know why that happened
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:51.040]  that it shouldn't have happened but the LAPD has refused to contact Mercedes to get any
[01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:57.160]  information on why that would happen on top of that unbelievable the engine being found
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:04.560]  about 150 feet away from the car behind the vehicle Dvorak talked to two physics experts
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:08.960]  two professors who said that the engine if it detached from the car would follow the
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:15.440]  forward velocity of the vehicle so it wouldn't be behind the vehicle 150 feet if it detached
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:20.280]  it would be in front of the vehicle so there's that there's also you know the witnesses said
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:24.240]  they blew up in the middle of the road then flew off the road that's why the engine went
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:28.080]  the opposite direction if it would have hit and had the engine dislodge might have gone
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:32.520]  you know a dozen yards or something if it ripped loose but all the experts said no way
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:39.640]  it would rip loose I mean you're talking about a big old big old keg of C4 here and
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:44.320]  also there are no skid marks on the road so if this was an accidental crash you would
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:49.400]  expect there to have been at least some resistance to driving so they said it jackknifed it just
[01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:55.440]  it just blew up into the air exactly so you know on top of that you've got the two university
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:42:00.520]  studies which show it's very easy to hack and remote control a modern vehicle you've
[01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:06.000]  got the former anti-terror czar Richard Clark coming out and saying that that's a possibility
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.360]  that's a plausible scenario you did that to distract off though I don't think it's remote
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:16.040]  control it's good old-fashioned C4 well then we've got you know the motive because we know
[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:22.080]  Hastings Exposed McChrystal back in 2010 he said he got death threats every single year
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:26.880]  from powerful people because of that we know from his friend who is a guest on your show
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:32.840]  Staff Sergeant Big said he was there when they said we're going to kill you oh yeah he routinely
[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:38.320]  talked about that and in fact a recent interview with CNN that they just had excerpts of Hastings
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:42.480]  which was actually recorded a year ago only just aired he said that there was a ton of
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:47.320]  information he could have put in that book that he didn't so that suggests he had even
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:52.640]  more dirt on people in high positions of power that he hadn't released in the public domain
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:58.040]  so yet another motivation he was contacting friends in the hours before his death sending
[01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:02.040]  out emails saying he was going off the radar he was paranoid he was under investigation
[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:07.760]  by the FBI his friend again Joseph Big said that he drove like a grandma or it would be
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:13.560]  very uncharacteristic for him to be driving at such high speed in the middle of the night
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:18.600]  WikiLeaks reported that he contacted them saying he was being investigated by the FBI
[01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:25.440]  because we know he had quote the biggest story yet on the CIA about to come out all of this
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:31.600]  all of the evidence surrounding the crash itself being suspicious and yet it was case
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:37.720]  closed within days no no foul play according to the LAPD who now refuses to release information
[01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:43.920]  and are telling cops and firefighters not to talk about it well I texted Biggs this morning
[01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:47.680]  and he got back with me an hour ago I hadn't checked my text I'm going to call him during
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:51.280]  a break he may pop in and overdrive the day around the nightly news but he says yeah
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:56.120]  this is really getting suspicious he's taught he's trying to talk to the police right now
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:44:01.720]  so we'll try to find out what happens with that but the family and friends are all scared
[01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:08.240]  he has said and so that's why he's had the courage to go public because everybody else
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:14.240]  is scared and folks once a tyranny has everybody scared it's one then you get the Nazi Germany
[01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:18.640]  you get the Soviet Russia once they get to this point where it's implicit that they're
[01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:23.240]  the ones doing this which it basically now is where they operate out in the open then
[01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:29.240]  you either remove them or they can do anything they want so we're now at that point of are
[01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:34.200]  we going to be a totally broken disgusting country and it's time for police and military
[01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:39.120]  and people in the system to speak out more than ever and that's why they're so scared
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:43.200]  of whistleblowers though is because that's the big chink in their armor Paul Watson you'll
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:48.000]  cover this more tonight hosting info wars nightly news 7 o'clock central for prison
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:54.040]  planet dot TV subscribers thank you so much thanks Alex all right there goes Paul Watson

[01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:09.120]  everybody else that's patiently holding but I saw a story upon info wars dot com sustainable
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:15.960]  development park violates artist first amendment and his his his great art that you can see
[01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:23.960]  up on the site was up there for a while and then they removed it because it was kind of
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:33.160]  a tea party ask showing people with American flags marching and stuff like that just serious
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:38.320]  thought criminal I mean stuff you would imagine in the old America really evil George Washington
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:43.800]  type stuff and so he contacted us or a writer Julie Wilson wrote a story about it we're
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:49.200]  putting some of his amazing art up on screen we have a link to his art side as well in
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:55.360]  the story but joining us info wars dot com one of the latest additions here one of our
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:46:01.320]  reporters who's done local reporting for a few years on radio and in print is Julie Wilson
[01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:05.000]  Julie what's your take on this tell people about where this is what's happening and now
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:09.920]  reportedly he's been blacklisted they've sent an email around town saying you know this
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:16.400]  is a this is a person that you know that we're not to support basically which is a good authoritarian
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:22.960]  instinct that we would expect to see in North Korea come on closer to your microphone for
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:29.760]  me thanks go ahead basically this artist Chris Hobay as a company called artist yeah I'm
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:35.120]  sorry we changed mics around a little bit today didn't test that beforehand so yeah
[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:39.640]  it's just lean right up on it and just get right up on the mic there we go okay so there's
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:44.480]  this artist named Chris Hobay he has a company called artistic revolts he's a popular artist
[01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:50.520]  in Atlanta Georgia and kind of the irony in this story is that he's had his artwork on
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:55.520]  display in the area for seven to ten years never had any issues and in fact he's you
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:47:00.880]  know had a lot of fans he's got a lot of compliments on his work but recently he partnered up with
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:05.640]  a company called Atlantic station which seems like it's kind of like a Zilcher park for
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:11.960]  Austin place to have dining movies in the park concerts festivals that kind of thing
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:18.560]  so he made a contract with them to build a setup his art booth there and he had one successful
[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:23.760]  showing he got good feedback from the customers and the leasing agents on the property and
[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:27.720]  so he waited for his next monthly round to set up shop he put twenty five hundred dollars
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:33.720]  into his booth you know because he had his success last time and this time the GM came
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:39.240]  by his booth and started questioning his artwork and asked him you know what political party
[01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:44.560]  do you belong to and you know what are your political viewpoint he did stuff like a science
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:50.920]  saying tax to death showing Uncle Sam as a skeleton I mean how evil how American right
[01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:56.040]  this is Phil this is evil so Chris Hobay you know told him listen you know I'm not actually
[01:47:56.040 --> 01:48:00.720]  affiliated with any political party you know actually show our history you know through
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:05.400]  my work and I don't consider it to be he shows veterans marching with American flags ooh
[01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:11.520]  that's bad and so the GM actually left on the note with complimenting him on his work
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:15.020]  and then took off in his golf cart and the next thing he knew the leasing agents came
[01:48:15.020 --> 01:48:19.320]  by and told him that he had to shut down shop immediately and that if he didn't they were
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:23.720]  going to escort him off the property and so while he was taking out his work a local newspaper
[01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:28.200]  called creative loathing loafing excuse me it was a photograph in his work and said hey
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:32.080]  you know what are you doing where are you going and he said you know I've been asked to leave
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:36.960]  and so he left the premises and a short time later he got a phone call from that same newspaper
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:42.200]  telling him that a mass email was circulating around to all the businesses in Atlantic City
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:47.240]  or I'm sorry Atlantic station saying that his work was actually I can give you the quote
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:55.880]  right here they told him that his work was in Atlanta Georgia violent and political nature
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:59.320]  of the art and that they were not allowed anywhere in the property for purchases of
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:05.040]  a gallery or shop so there's nothing violent because he sent us the stuff that was there
[01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:09.640]  I mean they just take everything and demonized it and say oh you're criticizing the government
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:14.160]  that might cause violence that's what all these newspaper reporters always ask me and
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:19.680]  then Bloomberg had the quote in there Alex Jones doesn't build bombs he builds bombers
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:25.080]  yeah that was really I thought the defense contractors built bombers and the FBI built
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:31.000]  bombers another point that I really want to make about this story is that the park that
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:35.640]  shut this guy down when you go to their website they actually advertise themselves as the
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:41.960]  national model for smart growth and sustainable development and their motto is live work and
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:46.060]  play in the same community well let me tell you what you do to this UN group he goes in
[01:49:46.060 --> 01:49:50.760]  videotapes other art anything that has a skeleton because the most offensive thing to be Uncle
[01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:57.680]  Sam's a skeleton and say you know how is that violent and then show any other type of art
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:50:02.600]  like that then you have a discrimination issue and you've got to block these authoritarians
[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:08.200]  because they will shut everybody down yeah he said that the booth next to him had our
[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:11.640]  that had nudity and all that kind of stuff which was supposed to be banned from the festival
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:17.240]  but nothing was said to them so well the point is you come they they accept you to the festival
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:23.880]  then they kick you out this is how real authoritarianism operates first thing Hitler did with gypsy
[01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:28.880]  shoes and other groups was not let them be in festivals then they couldn't have their
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:33.160]  own business you know they go knock the windows out and then oh you got to go to this this
[01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:36.680]  ghetto for your safety and then oh we're going to put you on these trains for your safety
[01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:40.600]  that's how it works people can read the full article and see the evil thought crime at

[02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:04.360]  a lot of problems in america but nobody seems to know what to do about it i think we need
[02:04:04.360 --> 02:04:11.200]  to start organizing like the marxists have done for the last 40 or 50 years the fourth
[02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:17.680]  of july is a historic day we have a year between now and the next one i believe we need to
[02:04:17.680 --> 02:04:26.120]  organize a fourth of july event that teaches people teaches people why america was formed
[02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:32.920]  who formed america and the reasons why it was done that sounds pretty terrorist we need
[02:04:32.920 --> 02:04:38.920]  to organize we need to know who the patriots are we need to have organizations in all 50
[02:04:38.920 --> 02:04:44.960]  states and the next time that we have a fourth of july we need to have meetings through every
[02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:49.280]  state of the union through every county i hear you who's going to organize that man because
[02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:53.840]  that's a tall order you can do something simple like let's march on all the capitals to expose

[02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:05.000]  stuff are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us as we've moved
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:10.000]  through history every great leader has had to understand the potential of information

[02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:22.960]  psyche from compulsory state education to the hollywood media brainwashing machine we
[02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:28.120]  are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions when somebody obscures
[02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:32.560]  that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it they can take

[02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:50.760]  and author and speaker and I'm not going to go through all of her different degrees
[02:08:50.760 --> 02:08:56.600]  and background but she was a managing director at Goldman Sachs over some key areas that
[02:08:56.600 --> 02:09:00.240]  she thought was going to cause a major problem basically quit over it and I guess you could
[02:09:00.240 --> 02:09:03.720]  call it really a whistleblower she's written a bunch of bestselling books you got a new
[02:09:03.720 --> 02:09:09.160]  book coming out very very soon as well we'll talk to them about but Nomi Prince dot com
[02:09:09.160 --> 02:09:14.600]  we have links to that up on info wars dot com obviously I want to get into the announcement
[02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:19.280]  that there'll be no criminal charges two years later on Don Corazon of MF global I want
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:24.640]  to get into the bond market all your inside take on that but for new listeners out there
[02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:28.840]  we have a lot of new stations and new folks tuning in every millisecond tell people a
[02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:33.960]  little bit about yourself your awakening what you've witnessed and what this general system
[02:09:33.960 --> 02:09:39.840]  is and why you decided to get out of it was it a decade ago yeah over a decade now yeah
[02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:44.960]  I had been in international banking for over a decade actually I had been at Lehman Brothers
[02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:48.560]  I've been at Bear Stearns in London for seven years and then my final stop was Goldman
[02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:52.440]  Sachs where I was only for less than two years and just had to get out because it was just
[02:09:52.440 --> 02:09:56.880]  such a horrible environment around the time when Enron was imploding and WorldCom was
[02:09:56.880 --> 02:10:02.560]  imploding in this whole idea which later imploded the rest of the economy of credit derivatives
[02:10:02.560 --> 02:10:08.840]  and CDOs and all these esoteric things that had to do with horrible loans bonds that we're
[02:10:08.840 --> 02:10:12.320]  going to default companies that we're going to default we're really coming to the head
[02:10:12.320 --> 02:10:18.720]  of the company and Wall Street in general and I read your book that came out what in
[02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:23.920]  2006 or so 2004 2004 I guess I read 2006 where you explained what was going to happen before
[02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:27.360]  it happened you said I wasn't going to be involved in this criminality well no exactly
[02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:31.680]  we were literally sitting there in in offices looking at at tons of loans that we're going
[02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:34.800]  to implode derivatives that we're going to implode and being asked to sort of find a
[02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:37.960]  way to make money out of that for Goldman and for the company so as Enron and WorldCom
[02:10:37.960 --> 02:10:42.120]  whatever those companies were and I found that incredibly untenable it went through
[02:10:42.120 --> 02:10:45.360]  insurance companies went through all sorts of so you weren't going to sell it to pensioners
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:49.720]  and people I couldn't I had come to Goldman basically from a position where I believed
[02:10:49.720 --> 02:10:54.120]  even in all the years I was in banking that was important to show people what the downside
[02:10:54.120 --> 02:10:57.640]  could be of certain types of speculation and that was not something that Goldman really
[02:10:57.640 --> 02:11:02.000]  wanted to show and I had a lot of problems internally trying to be able to show analytics
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:07.000]  and develop things and get funding to show clients and investors in general what could
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:11.080]  go wrong because I thought if you have knowledge you can make a decision if you don't you're
[02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:16.200]  in a black hole and a fraudulent black hole but then the opposite of you is some of the
[02:11:16.200 --> 02:11:21.560]  traders and people at Goldman and the Timberwolf stuff about this is total crud let's sell
[02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:26.800]  it to our customers well that's what exactly happened was I left and in the next few years
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:31.320]  that followed when I left which was in early 2002 and I wrote a book in 2004 came out in
[02:11:31.320 --> 02:11:35.440]  2004 I wrote in 2003 about how all of this was going to implode and how these wars between
[02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:40.680]  the banks and these trading desks and we're really being fought over people's loans and
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:44.560]  that's what happened the subprime loans all of the regular loans in the country became
[02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:49.880]  fodder for these CDO deals like Timberwolf like Abacus like all the different names that
[02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:53.720]  were thrown at them that then imploded into the general economy a few years later but
[02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:59.080]  at the time the whole idea was to move move move the stuff off the trading books into
[02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:03.040]  the world and that's what happened and over the next few years from when I left until
[02:12:03.040 --> 02:12:07.280]  basically the beginning of 2007 that's what was happening this stuff was proliferating
[02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:13.720]  the world pension funds small towns in Norway small towns in in Holland you know small towns
[02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:19.320]  in California and really creating this crumbling decay of an economy and I saw that from the
[02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:22.880]  outside I wasn't inside at that point and that's when I started writing more and more
[02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:27.400]  about that and I continue to write about that because it's it's the dangerous situation
[02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:30.960]  that people need to be aware of and need to have knowledge about not just the implosion
[02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:35.680]  that already happened that we think was over in 2008 it's not over well that was my next
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:39.760]  question I've seen the charts that there's more derivatives now than before they're taking
[02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:44.640]  the so-called bailout money too big to fail and re-leveraging it when they know it's impossible
[02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:49.440]  to ever pump it up I believe and I've seen a lot of evidence to show it's conscious to
[02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:53.680]  get everything infected with it so they can then hold everybody hostage saying do whatever
[02:12:53.680 --> 02:12:59.800]  we say in the future on any issue or everything will implode and then they become rulers of
[02:12:59.800 --> 02:13:04.920]  the world it's a Ponzi scheme that's too big to fail and so the whole world falls to it
[02:13:04.920 --> 02:13:08.960]  instead of them all going to jail I mean do you agree with what Bernie Madoff said I mean
[02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:12.120]  I think I do another economist I've talked to you have that when he said look I'm just
[02:13:12.120 --> 02:13:17.080]  doing what everybody else did and and if so why did he get in trouble then he had trouble
[02:13:17.080 --> 02:13:21.320]  because he didn't have as many political connections as some of these bigger guys who did not get
[02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:26.200]  in trouble yes he created a Ponzi scheme yes he lost a lot of people a lot of money yes
[02:13:26.200 --> 02:13:31.200]  he lied yes he kept it going for years and yes the SEC was told about it by various whistleblowers
[02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:36.480]  throughout the years and decade yeah ignore it completely until it was too big to ignore
[02:13:36.480 --> 02:13:44.240]  but he was too little a guy as big as he was to save himself that's right like unlike Don
[02:13:44.240 --> 02:13:48.720]  Quarzine and and Jamie Diamond and Lloyd Blank and all these other guys who are basically
[02:13:48.720 --> 02:13:55.240]  at the top of either large implosions that have been obvious or smaller types of deceptions
[02:13:55.240 --> 02:14:01.560]  that have gone on for years they are more politically connected to the to the administration
[02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:06.120]  to the various you know the DOJ the SEC all all the organizations in Washington that refuse
[02:14:06.120 --> 02:14:13.840]  to really fight jail indict convict any of the people that are really creating a larger
[02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:22.400]  global type of crimes against populations Wow again you've gotten some praise for what
[02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:27.440]  you've done but somebody like yourself or somebody like Amber Lyon who had won all these
[02:14:27.440 --> 02:14:34.800]  Emmys at CNN and was you know doing a great job and then she found out the West just two
[02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:40.640]  years ago or a year ago was actually covering up and funding mass murders of men women and
[02:14:40.640 --> 02:14:46.640]  children at demonstrations in places in the Middle East and then she found out her show
[02:14:46.640 --> 02:14:51.920]  had been bought out basically $500,000 behind the scenes per episode just to shut her down
[02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:57.120]  not only was CNN killing the story they were demanding payouts from the governments of
[02:14:57.120 --> 02:15:02.040]  Bahrain and others to cover it up and she left you know well-paying jobs she's famous
[02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:08.120]  she's you know everywhere to stop that you did the same thing a managing director at
[02:15:08.120 --> 02:15:13.720]  Goldman Sachs over some key areas describe what you were over and and of course I would
[02:15:13.720 --> 02:15:18.160]  do the same thing I have refused to sell out to big media and things just because there's
[02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:23.520]  no future if you don't but why is that so rare nowadays or is it just we don't know
[02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:27.960]  about all the people that did the right thing I think there's a little bit of both I think
[02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:31.200]  there's a lot of people who choose to leave those types of positions and just not become
[02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:35.160]  public you know just just go and do something else I have friends who used to work at Goldman
[02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:38.880]  who are you know helping orphans in Nicaragua you know I mean there's certain people that
[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:43.160]  just don't get out there publicly and talk about and then there's some people that do
[02:15:43.160 --> 02:15:47.200]  and I think it's really hard people get complacent or or they need the money or whatever it might
[02:15:47.200 --> 02:15:52.160]  be or or they they consider what they're doing not so bad they're making a living they're
[02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:54.880]  making a big living they're making a ton of money whatever it might be and they don't
[02:15:54.880 --> 02:16:00.840]  tend to take a look at themselves at the situation at the overall impact of it and and they stay
[02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:04.480]  in these positions or they leave and it's really hard when I first came out with my book my
[02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:09.280]  first book other people's money I was in London and there was a reporter that was asked at
[02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:13.320]  the London Times Magazine whether I had worked there and this this question apparently I
[02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:16.800]  found out later went back to Hank Paulson in New York and I don't know what happened
[02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:19.880]  in between him and the London office but the London office denied I had even worked there
[02:16:19.880 --> 02:16:23.440]  for a second and then of course they couldn't and because the news came out and the reporter
[02:16:23.440 --> 02:16:27.040]  called me and said you worked here right I'm like yes I worked there yeah I've of course
[02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:33.080]  I did so there but there's a lot of difficulties along the way in in trying to talk about some
[02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:38.720]  very powerful institutions you know powerful individuals and also a lot of esoteric financial
[02:16:38.720 --> 02:16:44.240]  stuff that's not always easy to explain to people and it's about your hocus pocus yes
[02:16:44.240 --> 02:16:50.160]  it's it's it's taking stuff financial loans whatever they may be and repackaging to make
[02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:55.360]  them look better and throwing them on to someone else until the game is over and the banks
[02:16:55.360 --> 02:17:00.960]  that created this stuff are fine or they're bailed out or they get to tax deduct losses
[02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:06.120]  and have all sorts of manners to to protect themselves whereas externally there there
[02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:09.600]  aren't those same kinds of protections and it's the same thing if you're inside of a
[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:13.200]  system you're trying to talk about it whether you call whistleblowing or explaining or creating
[02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:18.880]  knowledge or whatever you call it it's it's it's it's very hard to go against that sometimes
[02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:22.800]  and you have to be independent I think in order to do it a lot of the times you have
[02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:26.520]  to decide I'm not going to be part of that establishment I'm not even going to necessarily
[02:17:26.520 --> 02:17:32.080]  sure yeah I don't believe it and I can be part of it you know they call it buffers or
[02:17:32.080 --> 02:17:37.000]  they call it plausible deniability but I've seen the UN and Goldman Sachs and all these
[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:42.120]  globalists are really good at is they have committees and they call things that are one
[02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:46.520]  thing another thing and then they all act like they have plausible deniability to not
[02:17:46.520 --> 02:17:52.840]  know so no one ever gets left with a hang grenade they're passing around the table but then
[02:17:52.840 --> 02:17:57.480]  once they can't get in trouble it creates this risk this moral hazard they've talked
[02:17:57.480 --> 02:18:02.800]  about or now they can get away with anything because it's all set up with a bunch of sergeant
[02:18:02.800 --> 02:18:07.240]  Schultz saying I know nothing when they know full well what they're doing and then you
[02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:11.800]  look at it it's going to bring down the society and they're gearing up the FEMA camps and
[02:18:11.800 --> 02:18:16.040]  the armed troops all over the world and British Ministry of Defense reports admitting this
[02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:21.800]  is going to end civilization as we know it because we'll never triage the debt we'll
[02:18:21.800 --> 02:18:27.200]  never arrest these people it's like you either cut them out or we all are destroyed and the
[02:18:27.200 --> 02:18:32.440]  answer is you'll be destroyed it's is there any way out of the madness these people are
[02:18:32.440 --> 02:18:36.880]  the system and they've been the system if you're running a major bank if you're Jamie
[02:18:36.880 --> 02:18:42.960]  Diamond or your President Obama you are inextricate you're linked you have an alliance you can't
[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:47.880]  let the other person fail so if you're Obama and you're going into rise from you know state
[02:18:47.880 --> 02:18:51.720]  senate to senate to the president you're Jamie Diamond you're rising from the head of bank
[02:18:51.720 --> 02:18:55.360]  one to the head of JP Morgan Chase to the you know the most important banker right now
[02:18:55.360 --> 02:19:00.200]  and in the country and arguably the world you are together you keep each other up and
[02:19:00.200 --> 02:19:03.360]  all these other systems that are in place whether it's the Federal Reserve the New York
[02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:07.280]  Fellows sure the Department of Justice that ignores that anything can possibly sure that's
[02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:11.360]  how corruption works that's how it happened right because once they allow it in place
[02:19:11.360 --> 02:19:16.040]  no one can bust anybody or it brings it down and then suddenly corruption just takes over
[02:19:16.040 --> 02:19:20.040]  right they are the same people and it's it's mutually enforcing it's enforcing within the
[02:19:20.040 --> 02:19:24.200]  banking industry on Wall Street and it's enforcing between Washington and Wall Street and and
[02:19:24.200 --> 02:19:30.280]  what has happened since the the crisis of 2008 is this ability to take down the economy
[02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:34.720]  is this massive amount of debt here in Europe the instability in the Middle East all of
[02:19:34.720 --> 02:19:41.400]  this is is connected to the fact that there was a financial crisis that was predicated
[02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:48.560]  on bankers creating potential you know fuzzy value out of nothing proliferating the world

[02:24:25.160 --> 02:24:31.240]  managing director I'm reading your first book about this in 2006 you were actually able
[02:24:31.240 --> 02:24:36.480]  to see all of it because in in your position weren't you like over the big international
[02:24:36.480 --> 02:24:42.400]  transfers and trying to make sure that the regulations mashed on these deals yeah that's
[02:24:42.400 --> 02:24:48.200]  a very good memory I had been responsible for a particular group that focused on financial
[02:24:48.200 --> 02:24:53.760]  clients insurance companies banks pension funds and any basically financial investor
[02:24:53.760 --> 02:24:58.880]  and try to look at how if they were going to be seeing any losses how this could be
[02:24:58.880 --> 02:25:02.840]  sort of repackaged and sold off of their books so if a bank was going through a potential
[02:25:02.840 --> 02:25:07.760]  loss or insurance company had some claims that weren't working package them up reconstruct
[02:25:07.760 --> 02:25:11.240]  them into something else and sell them along to other investors so there was a lot of that
[02:25:11.240 --> 02:25:17.040]  and I was also responsible for the analytics in derivatives and credit derivatives which
[02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:22.200]  became at the center of all this stuff and the nascent development of CDOs which you
[02:25:22.200 --> 02:25:25.000]  know you talk about you were right in the middle of it I was in the middle of it before
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:30.280]  it became some prime it was it was corporate debt and you just watched in Ron go to jail
[02:25:30.280 --> 02:25:33.280]  that's the good part about people getting in trouble it makes other people think you
[02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:37.760]  said I'm getting out of here well I left before they go to jail I knew when they were imploding
[02:25:37.760 --> 02:25:42.440]  I knew when their positions were imploding because Goma was actually a trading partner
[02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:47.200]  in in derivatives with and Ron says it was pretty easy to know what was what was going
[02:25:47.200 --> 02:25:50.400]  to go on and that was around the fall of course of 9-11 and I wound up leaving for number
[02:25:50.400 --> 02:25:55.560]  yeah 9-11 was very personal you know is you for for anyone who was working down on Wall
[02:25:55.560 --> 02:25:59.320]  Street at the time and I was also an element of life's too short oh wow you were in New
[02:25:59.320 --> 02:26:02.520]  York when that happened and I was down on Goldman when a Goldman when that happened
[02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:06.800]  which is a few blocks away from the world trade wow we're there with the you know the dark
[02:26:06.800 --> 02:26:09.480]  and windows also not really knowing what's going on at that point we're just inside
[02:26:09.480 --> 02:26:13.960]  a building before all the information started coming out so so that came out that that was
[02:26:13.960 --> 02:26:17.880]  that was a big sort of call to you know examine all the things that I don't even bothered
[02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:22.640]  about a major reality check major major and I quit you know a few months after that so
[02:26:22.640 --> 02:26:25.840]  there was a and I was a whole all of that was going on at the same time and there was
[02:26:25.840 --> 02:26:29.720]  a World Trade Center there was 9-11 there was and Ron's father there was you know the
[02:26:29.720 --> 02:26:34.400]  upcoming telecom frauds that were all come out after I left and a lot of that stuff going
[02:26:34.400 --> 02:26:40.080]  on and also in the atmosphere was was toxic at all it always was but it just became way
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:44.200]  too much when we hear these recordings of Goldman Sachs guys bragging about yeah I'm
[02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:48.640]  going to shake these old ladies all that earthquake that was my wallet dropping yeah we're gonna
[02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:54.880]  sell these you know idiots this crud I mean how many of them are like that there are some
[02:26:54.880 --> 02:26:58.800]  loudmouths who are definitely definitely like that and there's ones that are that are more
[02:26:58.800 --> 02:27:02.040]  reserved you know there's the old school bankers and there's the ones who have actually done
[02:27:02.040 --> 02:27:07.080]  quite well being you know being like that going back to 9-11 when I went out when we
[02:27:07.080 --> 02:27:10.560]  were there on the trading floor and there was all the smoking stuff around the oil guys
[02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:14.880]  were we're on the desk and their boss was saying like hey you know make money like we
[02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:17.840]  don't know what's going on no one knows what's going on but you know what it had to do with
[02:27:17.840 --> 02:27:23.280]  a plane planes oil oil money you know keep trading you know that's the kind of environment
[02:27:23.280 --> 02:27:27.480]  that that a lot of those types of guys are very very and then they're like hey just tell
[02:27:27.480 --> 02:27:32.080]  the firefighters that the dust isn't bad so we could stay open and don't tell them to
[02:27:32.080 --> 02:27:35.520]  wear respirators because then they'll know it's bad then we'll have to close everything
[02:27:35.520 --> 02:27:41.480]  tell them it's safe when they had a report hours after saying it's deadly they had sensors
[02:27:41.480 --> 02:27:44.640]  again it just shows these are these people are out of their minds they wanted us to all
[02:27:44.640 --> 02:27:48.240]  come down to work you know the next day two days later when the city was mostly closed
[02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:52.400]  I didn't come down I mean again this was all sort of you know part of my own combinations
[02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:57.360]  of revelations over the years but yeah there's there was people down in those offices very
[02:27:57.360 --> 02:28:00.200]  much let me ask you this question this is a short segment long segment coming up and
[02:28:00.200 --> 02:28:04.120]  then I want to get into whatever you think's most important talk about I mean so tell me
[02:28:04.120 --> 02:28:10.720]  these questions aren't good or aren't as important as they should be where to go where does it
[02:28:10.720 --> 02:28:15.320]  all end I mean I look at the derivatives some numbers are 600 trillion some are lower some
[02:28:15.320 --> 02:28:21.760]  are higher what is going to happen with all of this where does it end because they're
[02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:26.720]  only expanding all of it from what I've seen where does it end right the expansion happens
[02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:30.280]  from the fact that since the crisis these banks that were big have gotten bigger you
[02:28:30.280 --> 02:28:33.200]  know they've been allowed to merge they've had federal backing they continue to have
[02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:37.400]  federal backing they know they can continue with creating you know bigger derivatives
[02:28:37.400 --> 02:28:41.080]  positions taking more fees off their regular clients to be able to grow what they're doing
[02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:45.800]  in the speculative world and so forth but what they know right now is that they will
[02:28:45.800 --> 02:28:50.640]  be supported so again it's this mutual support system from the Federal Reserve in the ECB
[02:28:50.640 --> 02:28:54.520]  to keep the US banks and the European banks which basically control the entire global
[02:28:54.520 --> 02:28:59.720]  financial system up as long as they can so you create debt you keep rates are down low
[02:28:59.720 --> 02:29:04.480]  you keep it going you keep it going meanwhile the derivatives positions that the more risky
[02:29:04.480 --> 02:29:09.920]  types of transactions in which these banks are operating also continue to blow up because
[02:29:09.920 --> 02:29:14.560]  they're being supported they've been bailed out they're being supported to go on and
[02:29:14.560 --> 02:29:17.880]  go forward I don't really think that ends I think what's happening now is when there's
[02:29:17.880 --> 02:29:24.640]  this false period of you know an anesthetic of these of these types of bailout programs
[02:29:24.640 --> 02:29:29.440]  and these zero interest rates which are just going to kind of keep things in an indefinite
[02:29:29.440 --> 02:29:33.880]  limbo until the next shoe drops which I believe will happen because this cannot continue forever
[02:29:33.880 --> 02:29:38.480]  and I want to talk about how big that next shoe will be what's happening in the bond
[02:29:38.480 --> 02:29:43.680]  market and so much more with Nomi Prince straight ahead she was a managing director at Goldman
[02:29:43.680 --> 02:29:52.120]  Sachs and left rather than be involved in all the corruption we're on the march the empires

[02:36:41.880 --> 02:36:46.440]  she said she wrote the book three years before I read it two years after it was after out
[02:36:46.440 --> 02:36:53.120]  and now she's got several other books that are out as well but but expanding you were
[02:36:53.120 --> 02:36:57.880]  saying during the break things about Obama I want to get to in a moment but first off
[02:36:57.880 --> 02:37:04.120]  I know me get into my big question how do you expect things to unravel how to how do
[02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:08.080]  the experts you respect to have a good track record of predicting things how do they say
[02:37:08.080 --> 02:37:13.120]  the next shoe will drop and what it will look like and what's happening in these rig markets
[02:37:13.120 --> 02:37:17.640]  how long will it go as we learn about libor and the fixing of interest rates and and
[02:37:17.640 --> 02:37:23.280]  the fact that high frequency trading I mean this thing is a giant rig casino ripping
[02:37:23.280 --> 02:37:28.680]  people off how will it melt down will it melt down and if it doesn't melt down what will
[02:37:28.680 --> 02:37:34.200]  it do with the expense of the people if first of all this historic period right now we have
[02:37:34.200 --> 02:37:40.920]  had a longer series of cheap money of of of zero percent interest rates of the Federal
[02:37:40.920 --> 02:37:46.880]  Reserve the ECB bolstering all of the financial toxic assets that were built the financial
[02:37:46.880 --> 02:37:51.000]  system that was being prolifically into the into the world and and how that was going
[02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:56.720]  to self-destruct it continues to hold it up the stock market is held up by this any corporate
[02:37:56.720 --> 02:38:01.000]  profits of the companies that are larger and that are still posting corporate profits although
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:05.560]  they're not really hiring they are posting profits are doing so because it is so cheap
[02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:11.760]  for them not individuals but for banks and for their main customers to raise money this
[02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:16.360]  is why it looks there's the appearance between the stock market and some of the corporate
[02:38:16.360 --> 02:38:20.160]  bond market that things are healthy there's the appearance that banks are doing okay they
[02:38:20.160 --> 02:38:25.080]  haven't had to because of accounting laws that have been changed in 2008 when the financial
[02:38:25.080 --> 02:38:30.120]  crisis happened that have allowed them to really camouflage losses that they continue
[02:38:30.120 --> 02:38:33.880]  to carry on their books meanwhile they've expanded derivatives and all sorts of other
[02:38:33.880 --> 02:38:38.480]  esoteric things they're doing because it doesn't cost them anything to do that that's the market
[02:38:38.480 --> 02:38:42.960]  we're in right now synthetic derivatives synthetic derivatives meet be basically meet meaning
[02:38:42.960 --> 02:38:48.280]  creating packages of packages of packages of things that have no value and the reason
[02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:53.280]  these packages of things that have no value which were supposed to take a loan a regular
[02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:58.440]  simple basic loan yeah you pay me an interest rate I take a piece of it I pay my expenses
[02:38:58.440 --> 02:39:03.200]  I make some profit you do that a ton a ton of times and the loan has no value because
[02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:07.600]  the the asset underneath it has gone to zero and you create a derivative and another derivative
[02:39:07.600 --> 02:39:12.560]  and you repackage and you're basically running on fumes and then it's hidden under red tape
[02:39:12.560 --> 02:39:17.320]  it's hidden under accounting laws that that are effectively designed to camouflage these
[02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:21.280]  losses so that they give the appearance that these banks are in a so where does it go when
[02:39:21.280 --> 02:39:28.400]  does it end the the the fell reserve has been very tactical in keeping these rates at the
[02:39:28.400 --> 02:39:32.480]  zero levels that they are and every single time Bernanke comes out and says the economy
[02:39:32.480 --> 02:39:36.760]  might be getting a little better and and there might be possibility that that QE quantitative
[02:39:36.760 --> 02:39:41.640]  easing or the Fed buying the debt that is manufactured by bank banks and by the Treasury
[02:39:41.640 --> 02:39:45.320]  Department to keep this all going and keep rates low every time that happens the market
[02:39:45.320 --> 02:39:49.480]  wobbles everybody freaks out and Bernanke comes back and says something like oh you know what
[02:39:49.480 --> 02:39:52.560]  it actually kind of is bad we're going to keep going with this and then everything's
[02:39:52.560 --> 02:39:58.640]  all all fine again visually in the market and in the bond market the reality is it's
[02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:04.200]  not real these are all artificially being lifted how long does that last it's lasted
[02:40:04.200 --> 02:40:08.600]  at this point for four and a half years it can continue to last for another year and
[02:40:08.600 --> 02:40:13.120]  a half to because he can't really take his foot off quantitative easing and whoever comes
[02:40:13.120 --> 02:40:17.320]  in after Bernanke is going have a really tough time doing the same thing I believe this policy
[02:40:17.320 --> 02:40:22.840]  is going to continue meanwhile the European economies are are imploding the real US economy
[02:40:22.840 --> 02:40:27.120]  isn't doing very well if you take away the the bigger banks and institutions benefiting
[02:40:27.120 --> 02:40:32.480]  from cheap money from zero interest rate money so I think this continues this time another
[02:40:32.480 --> 02:40:37.360]  few years with slow implosion at at the center at the core economies in Europe in the Middle
[02:40:37.360 --> 02:40:42.560]  East in the US is what they've said they want slow implosion to slowly that that's exactly
[02:40:42.560 --> 02:40:47.040]  what's going on now which is different from before before rates were sort of normal they
[02:40:47.040 --> 02:40:51.240]  came low banks were doing all sorts of creativity with with with subprime loans and creating
[02:40:51.240 --> 02:40:55.440]  all these toxic assets and getting into the derivatives market and everything else now
[02:40:55.440 --> 02:41:00.560]  it's all been subsidized so now this can continue for another it's not as quick to the next
[02:41:00.560 --> 02:41:05.320]  you got on comes down I think it could take more like three or four years of but a very
[02:41:05.320 --> 02:41:11.760]  slow painful time until that happens until derivatives are are so expansive until there
[02:41:11.760 --> 02:41:16.120]  cannot be more money pumped in until the debt is so high that it can't be kept at zero because
[02:41:16.120 --> 02:41:21.840]  nobody wants to buy it no country no funds and there's just no cash left to set aside
[02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:25.600]  to do this and that's when I think you get the next implosion but I don't think that's
[02:41:25.600 --> 02:41:29.240]  for another few years I think it's a slow drip until that is going to be a lot bigger when
[02:41:29.240 --> 02:41:33.560]  it implodes next there's a lot more writing on it it there's a lot more writing out there's
[02:41:33.560 --> 02:41:37.600]  a bigger derivatives market these banks have grown bigger the ones that have survived what
[02:41:37.600 --> 02:41:42.400]  about the bond market we're seeing more talk of the Chinese currency being more the world
[02:41:42.400 --> 02:41:47.000]  reserve currency other countries and groups are moving away from the dollar and and and
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:50.840]  now they're starting to cut back on the Treasury's then they use the dollar imploding people
[02:41:50.840 --> 02:41:56.080]  get scared and coming prop it up it kind of seesaws back and forth what does what's happening
[02:41:56.080 --> 02:42:02.640]  in the bond market in layman's terms what does that signify this limbo period that that
[02:42:02.640 --> 02:42:07.920]  I'm talking about you you just mentioned now in fact it's it's it's a limbo market the bonds
[02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:11.840]  stay prices sort of stay where they are they might dip a little and then the Fed comes
[02:42:11.840 --> 02:42:14.600]  in and says no we're going to continue to buy bonds which means we're going to continue
[02:42:14.600 --> 02:42:18.240]  to keep rates low which means we're going to continue to keep the cost of money at zero
[02:42:18.240 --> 02:42:23.560]  for the big institutions we keep doing that that's where the dollar which should be a
[02:42:23.560 --> 02:42:30.200]  lot lower it should represent a lot less value in in in the external in in in the markets
[02:42:30.200 --> 02:42:36.560]  than it does because it's being for everything is being propped up if the purchasers of Treasury
[02:42:36.560 --> 02:42:41.080]  bonds stop buying or start selling the Chinese start selling the Japanese start selling it
[02:42:41.080 --> 02:42:46.480]  hurts them to and you know as you just said so so everybody we're sitting on top of powder
[02:42:46.480 --> 02:42:50.560]  cake on the same game everyone's in the same game right now but they're they're depressing
[02:42:50.560 --> 02:42:55.040]  the real economy while expanding their own economy that's all luxury goods go up other
[02:42:55.040 --> 02:43:02.080]  stuff only grows slowly in inflation but I've I've just seen where real interest rates
[02:43:02.080 --> 02:43:06.320]  for the general public are going up and then now they have this supposed you know zero
[02:43:06.320 --> 02:43:11.080]  percent but that's only for the insiders that's becoming more and more obvious how long can
[02:43:11.080 --> 02:43:18.480]  that go on because I'm seeing the attitude in the general public become hyper aware
[02:43:18.480 --> 02:43:22.600]  I mean you've got some that'll buy anything but I'm seeing on talk radio listening to
[02:43:22.600 --> 02:43:26.880]  other shows and I'm seeing on the streets and I'm seeing in Gallup poll lowest approval
[02:43:26.880 --> 02:43:32.200]  rating ever for the media and for Congress and for Obama I'm I don't think people are
[02:43:32.200 --> 02:43:39.840]  buying into the bull anymore and so how long can this go again I think it individuals the
[02:43:39.840 --> 02:43:44.920]  real economy do understand and and do see costs going up health care costs education
[02:43:44.920 --> 02:43:49.640]  costs food costs the cost of living versus what's the education doesn't do anything
[02:43:49.640 --> 02:43:53.160]  anymore you can't get out and get a job or you can get a couple jobs that don't really
[02:43:53.160 --> 02:43:56.960]  pay you don't get benefits whatever it is I mean globalism killing us it doesn't work
[02:43:56.960 --> 02:44:02.400]  the quality of the real economy is deteriorating while the artificiality of this this banking
[02:44:02.400 --> 02:44:08.120]  economy continues to be subsidized by cheap money which the rest of the public can't get
[02:44:08.120 --> 02:44:12.560]  to because banks are sitting on it because they have the benefit they don't pass it on
[02:44:12.560 --> 02:44:16.600]  I again I think that continues for another few years it continues until someone says
[02:44:16.600 --> 02:44:21.560]  you know what the Fed has to dial back because the United States and the banking system of
[02:44:21.560 --> 02:44:25.600]  the United States and the Federal Reserve that that you know basically the bankers bank
[02:44:25.600 --> 02:44:30.520]  in the United States continues to create a policy that makes them all look good while
[02:44:30.520 --> 02:44:34.520]  it doesn't do anything for the real economy so we're continuing to fragment so it's good
[02:44:34.520 --> 02:44:38.400]  that people are looking at their own lives and trying to sort of detach themselves as
[02:44:38.400 --> 02:44:43.720]  much as they can but at the same time it's going to deteriorate the quality let me ask
[02:44:43.720 --> 02:44:47.500]  you this and obviously it's not just making them look good they're they're hoarding the
[02:44:47.500 --> 02:44:53.400]  bailout money they're becoming just so fabulously rich it's a joke how will they spend the money
[02:44:53.400 --> 02:45:00.400]  if they wreck the entire society right luxury goods on saving it away on why does Jamie
[02:45:00.400 --> 02:45:04.240]  Diamond get to make ten million dollars a year I mean all these things continue to allow
[02:45:04.240 --> 02:45:10.040]  them to to hoard institutionally and to hoard for themselves personally and that's definitely
[02:45:10.040 --> 02:45:13.700]  what they're doing expand on this that they're building government bunkers they're hoarding
[02:45:13.700 --> 02:45:18.480]  food Goldman Sachs people are buying guns that's come out in Bloomberg they're digging
[02:45:18.480 --> 02:45:22.480]  in they're buying retreats why are they doing that why do they have money now they have
[02:45:22.480 --> 02:45:26.760]  the money now and they know at some point there might be an inavailability to get some
[02:45:26.760 --> 02:45:31.120]  of these things because there there won't be enough people creating them it'll individual
[02:45:31.120 --> 02:45:34.000]  economies will be so bad there's going to be deterioration on that side so what they're
[02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:37.600]  doing is they're taking their money and running it's a definition of not being left with the
[02:45:37.600 --> 02:45:41.320]  bag if they have the money now if they have two parades now if they're getting great bonuses
[02:45:41.320 --> 02:45:45.280]  now the stock market's up high now they're they're in there first and so in the stock
[02:45:45.280 --> 02:45:50.000]  market does come down dramatically and we saw it can happen from two that's my point
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:54.000]  they're digging in like it's the end of the world and they're going to have a civil war
[02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:59.240]  with us I mean I have the FBI training manuals in the I mean they're training to mass arrest
[02:45:59.240 --> 02:46:04.160]  people and stuff and take over cities and I mean they're acting like they're going to
[02:46:04.160 --> 02:46:08.960]  bring us into a total depression and the more money they have at the top of that pile that
[02:46:08.960 --> 02:46:13.120]  the more protected they are from what's happening to the rest of but how about they all just
[02:46:13.120 --> 02:46:17.040]  get arrested like Bernie Madoff because I've talked to Ron Paul a lot of people I respect
[02:46:17.040 --> 02:46:21.120]  they say there's ways to fix this for the general public they're fair and constitutional
[02:46:21.120 --> 02:46:24.760]  why do we let these crooks run everything well that's a big I mean it's the question of like
[02:46:24.760 --> 02:46:30.720]  why do women like bad guys you know that old joke I just do not get why we let these crooks
[02:46:30.720 --> 02:46:35.560]  run everything those crooks are are the government right now and that that that's the problem
[02:46:35.560 --> 02:46:39.000]  we're talking about Bernie Madoff was not part of the the fraternity of the Justice
[02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:42.200]  Department the law firm that the Attorney General's part of is the one that does the
[02:46:42.200 --> 02:46:45.800]  certifications on all this fraud right and all these people who create all these fraud
[02:46:45.800 --> 02:46:50.880]  are the ones who supported the current administration in doing what they do that they are all mutually
[02:46:50.880 --> 02:46:54.240]  enforcing each other that's why they don't arrest each other you know you point a finger
[02:46:54.240 --> 02:46:57.040]  at once somebody goes down everybody else goes down diamond goes down everyone goes
[02:46:57.040 --> 02:47:03.240]  down right he's connected to everybody and how is the cult of Obama allowed them could
[02:47:03.240 --> 02:47:07.600]  have Bush if he had a third term have gotten away with this and and has Obama been better
[02:47:07.600 --> 02:47:14.440]  or worse than Bush on letting banks run wild Bush came to office with a lot of initial
[02:47:14.440 --> 02:47:20.920]  banker support when he was just a senator when he won the Obama Senate Obama and I'll
[02:47:20.920 --> 02:47:24.760]  go back to Bush but when basically he came in he really had he already had Goldman Sachs
[02:47:24.760 --> 02:47:28.400]  behind was one of his top 20 donors this is not into the president this is into this into
[02:47:28.400 --> 02:47:33.800]  the Senate seat you know he had JP Morgan as J. Morgan Chase is one of his donors
[02:47:33.800 --> 02:47:39.640]  etc he was in Chicago before that where bank one which has now become a part of JP Morgan
[02:47:39.640 --> 02:47:43.480]  Chase and that's what Jamie Diamond used to run was there at the same time you know in
[02:47:43.480 --> 02:47:46.800]  the same Chicago tower near wherever it is you know the Senate is when he was a local
[02:47:46.800 --> 02:47:51.400]  state senator and so forth I mean they basically have had a relationship going back before
[02:47:51.400 --> 02:47:58.360]  he even set foot he's been fast-tracked from the beginning from the beginning Bush did
[02:47:58.360 --> 02:48:05.360]  of course sign the emergency economics stabilization act in 2008 Obama lobbied for it Obama lobbied
[02:48:05.360 --> 02:48:09.320]  for it but Bush did sign it and Bush did say and I am this is in his memoirs you know we're
[02:48:09.320 --> 02:48:14.600]  going all in now when he said we're going all in it was before it is before 2009 when
[02:48:14.600 --> 02:48:17.640]  there really was an all-in situation when when the Fed came in and created all these
[02:48:17.640 --> 02:48:24.640]  additional programs to pile on to the tar program which was only $700 billion and added
[02:48:24.640 --> 02:48:29.280]  all these other ways for banks to be subsidized in the tune of trillions of dollars that happened
[02:48:29.280 --> 02:48:35.480]  during Obama's administration so there was a point at which Bush was interested in doing
[02:48:35.480 --> 02:48:39.920]  this and truly you know and Hank Paulson sort of straddled both presidents for a second
[02:48:39.920 --> 02:48:43.960]  I mean you know he wasn't Treasury Secretary under Obama of course but they worked together
[02:48:43.960 --> 02:48:47.320]  under Bush beforehand so to some extent there was a transition into it.
[02:48:47.320 --> 02:48:53.960]  Obama came in with a lot of backing from the banking system and he came in with with no
[02:48:53.960 --> 02:48:58.800]  regard to creating smaller banks from these bigger banks I mean he could have had a policy
[02:48:58.800 --> 02:49:00.800]  where he could have directed Congress.
[02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:05.840]  Yeah I mean you told me on air he was he told me off air he was worse than Bush basically.
[02:49:05.840 --> 02:49:11.400]  He was worse in terms of allowing these banks to become bigger and more powerful and have
[02:49:11.400 --> 02:49:16.680]  more federal subsidies and in the process sure from what I've seen they've been waging
[02:49:16.680 --> 02:49:21.340]  war on real local banks and now they're trying to take over credit unions.
[02:49:21.340 --> 02:49:24.520]  Because they can again they have not only this this money we're talking about they have
[02:49:24.520 --> 02:49:28.400]  access to more of it more easily their larger member banks of the federal reserve system
[02:49:28.400 --> 02:49:33.320]  they get to be able to have the position of being the big guy and beating up the little
[02:49:33.320 --> 02:49:35.920]  guy and this has been happening you know in US history for the last hundred years but
[02:49:35.920 --> 02:49:40.920]  it's been happening in particular in the last several years because they have been validated
[02:49:40.920 --> 02:49:44.960]  and we don't have a war we don't have you know there's we just have zero interest rates
[02:49:44.960 --> 02:49:50.280]  in a policy between Washington and Wall Street that enables these largest institutions to
[02:49:50.280 --> 02:49:53.240]  get increasingly bigger on cheaper means.
[02:49:53.240 --> 02:49:54.840]  It's a total banking takeover.
[02:49:54.840 --> 02:50:00.360]  It's a total takeover I mean I read the local banking association stuff in the Austin business
[02:50:00.360 --> 02:50:05.160]  journal and stuff and the head of the Texas Banking Association sounds like Ron Paul
[02:50:05.160 --> 02:50:06.560]  or myself or you.
[02:50:06.560 --> 02:50:10.040]  I mean what we're saying is not radical vision of this.
[02:50:10.040 --> 02:50:11.040]  It's rational.
[02:50:11.040 --> 02:50:12.520]  This is what's going on.
[02:50:12.520 --> 02:50:18.200]  You've got foreign mega offshore above the law banks who engineered all this using it
[02:50:18.200 --> 02:50:19.200]  to take over.
[02:50:19.200 --> 02:50:22.520]  I had an article yesterday where they're in Congress right now trying to take away tax
[02:50:22.520 --> 02:50:25.120]  exemption from credit unions.
[02:50:25.120 --> 02:50:27.080]  I mean it's incredible.
[02:50:27.080 --> 02:50:29.840]  It's a way to hurt the smaller ones and the ones that are lobbying for that of course the
[02:50:29.840 --> 02:50:33.720]  bigger institutions who want control who wrote the tax laws and don't even pay taxes
[02:50:33.720 --> 02:50:38.760]  anyways and have a lot more lobbyists working for them that's I mean if we let them shut
[02:50:38.760 --> 02:50:42.480]  down the credit unions I mean is there no end to this.
[02:50:42.480 --> 02:50:45.440]  And that's why we have to basically say you know what we're going to continue to support
[02:50:45.440 --> 02:50:49.880]  credit unions or local banks because they're not going to say okay we're going to back
[02:50:49.880 --> 02:50:50.880]  out.
[02:50:50.880 --> 02:50:54.480]  Chase, Citigroup Bank America they're not going to stay out.
[02:50:54.480 --> 02:50:57.480]  You have to basically give your business to the smaller institutions.
[02:50:57.480 --> 02:50:58.480]  Absolutely.
[02:50:58.480 --> 02:50:59.480]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:59.480 --> 02:51:00.480]  We'll be right back.

[02:54:20.280 --> 02:54:27.640]  like a space alien, makes me believe what David Ike says, they've now banned all computers.
[02:54:27.640 --> 02:54:29.520]  What outlaws all computers?
[02:54:29.520 --> 02:54:34.800]  Legislation was signed into law by Florida's former Tea Party favorite, Rick Scott, that
[02:54:34.800 --> 02:54:40.760]  bans all computers because they didn't properly read the bill.
[02:54:40.760 --> 02:54:44.440]  Totally bizarre, got that article, a bunch of other important news, TSA harasses and
[02:54:44.440 --> 02:54:46.480]  shames yet another disabled veteran.
[02:54:46.480 --> 02:54:48.040]  That's up on inforwars.com.
[02:54:48.040 --> 02:54:51.240]  Canadian cop gives homeless woman lunch money.
[02:54:51.240 --> 02:54:55.520]  That story won't go viral, though we should show people good behavior to try to model
[02:54:55.520 --> 02:54:56.520]  off that.
[02:54:56.520 --> 02:55:01.280]  The sustainable development part violates artist's first amendment rights, TSA sniffing
[02:55:01.280 --> 02:55:06.760]  bags at Texas shopping mall, heart-eating cannibal demands Obama send more weapons.
[02:55:06.760 --> 02:55:09.160]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[02:55:09.160 --> 02:55:12.040]  Police firefighters ordered not to speak about Michael Hastings crash.
[02:55:12.040 --> 02:55:15.640]  We're going to a little bit of overdrive with you, Nomi, so you can get into your new book
[02:55:15.640 --> 02:55:18.040]  that's coming out next year and the research.
[02:55:18.040 --> 02:55:22.600]  But I also want to get your take on the Michael Hastings.
[02:55:22.600 --> 02:55:26.120]  Now it's coming out that the police won't release the police report and they've told
[02:55:26.120 --> 02:55:30.160]  police and firefighters don't talk about what they saw, but the witnesses saw it blow up
[02:55:30.160 --> 02:55:34.640]  driving down the street and he said he was going into hiding, he'd had death threats
[02:55:34.640 --> 02:55:36.200]  and was about to break a big story.
[02:55:36.200 --> 02:55:39.000]  Gee, sounds like there should be an investigation to me.
[02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:46.240]  Yeah, you know, I had seen Michael Hastings a few weeks before that event at a book party
[02:55:46.240 --> 02:55:52.160]  actually for Dirty Wars, friend of his, Jeremy Skaehill, you know, great film, great movie,
[02:55:52.160 --> 02:55:53.400]  great book.
[02:55:53.400 --> 02:55:58.120]  And I walked over to the site the day after when I heard about it.
[02:55:58.120 --> 02:56:01.200]  It's actually close to, it's not too far away from where I live.
[02:56:01.200 --> 02:56:02.440]  It's in walking distance.
[02:56:02.440 --> 02:56:07.560]  Just to check out the sort of tree situation, you know, in terms of how, you know, it's
[02:56:07.560 --> 02:56:11.560]  an area I know there's been clips and you've seen clips, shown clips on your show where
[02:56:11.560 --> 02:56:18.400]  it's too straight away, you know, easy types of, you know, there's a roll that goes straight.
[02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:24.120]  Highland is, you know, it's a very easy double lane road, you know, Melrose cutting it.
[02:56:24.120 --> 02:56:25.120]  It's very visual.
[02:56:25.120 --> 02:56:27.560]  It's very, you know, even if you're going pretty fast at four in the morning, whatever
[02:56:27.560 --> 02:56:32.640]  reason you might be doing it, it's, it's, it's, it's hard to imagine, you know, missing
[02:56:32.640 --> 02:56:37.480]  that on your own, you know, and hitting a tree on your own.
[02:56:37.480 --> 02:56:41.160]  I don't know what he was doing there in the middle of the night, of course.
[02:56:41.160 --> 02:56:42.160]  Sure.
[02:56:42.160 --> 02:56:43.160]  Sure.
[02:56:43.160 --> 02:56:45.720]  But the witnesses say it blew up Melrose Street and then went over by the tree.
[02:56:45.720 --> 02:56:47.600]  And then now they're saying, don't release the police report.
[02:56:47.600 --> 02:56:48.960]  I mean, this is, this is amazing.
[02:56:48.960 --> 02:56:52.640]  The fact that they're not releasing the police report, the fact that, you know, the FBI
[02:56:52.640 --> 02:56:55.960]  basically said we, we weren't even, you know, looking at them for any reason.
[02:56:55.960 --> 02:56:57.960]  I mean, this guy was doing intense things.
[02:56:57.960 --> 02:57:01.720]  Well, it turns out that the family and friends say no, they did, they were visited and they're
[02:57:01.720 --> 02:57:04.520]  all scared because they see the FBI, I've talked to them.
[02:57:04.520 --> 02:57:08.160]  They see the FBI on the news saying we didn't visit them and they did.
[02:57:08.160 --> 02:57:11.360]  And they're like, I mean, they know now, they're all scared.
[02:57:11.360 --> 02:57:14.680]  Just the fact that the FBI denied everything because, you know, usually it would be like,
[02:57:14.680 --> 02:57:15.680]  well, we can't comment.
[02:57:15.680 --> 02:57:20.120]  You know, there was, there was a strong denial that they were looking into him or doing anything
[02:57:20.120 --> 02:57:25.120]  instead of a just we can't comment, which in itself is a little odd.
[02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:33.080]  But just the physicality of the location, you know, just, just seem like it more lends
[02:57:33.080 --> 02:57:38.040]  itself to being something that happened in advance of him taking over the car, him driving
[02:57:38.040 --> 02:57:39.040]  the car.
[02:57:39.040 --> 02:57:40.040]  Sure.
[02:57:40.040 --> 02:57:41.040]  Sure.
[02:57:41.040 --> 02:57:42.040]  What do the, what do the tree look like?
[02:57:42.040 --> 02:57:43.040]  The tree is pretty solid.
[02:57:43.040 --> 02:57:44.320]  I mean, it's a fat tree.
[02:57:44.320 --> 02:57:48.360]  So if anything was hitting it for whatever reason, whether it was pre-explosion or post-explosion,
[02:57:48.360 --> 02:57:50.440]  I, you know, the tree wasn't going to be going anywhere.
[02:57:50.440 --> 02:57:54.360]  But at the same time, if you were just driving regularly, even if you were under the influence,
[02:57:54.360 --> 02:57:55.360]  which we don't even know.
[02:57:55.360 --> 02:57:56.360]  I'm not, I'm not saying he was.
[02:57:56.360 --> 02:58:01.200]  I'm just saying any, any person, if they were, there was a ton of space to continue
[02:58:01.200 --> 02:58:02.200]  to going straight.
[02:58:02.200 --> 02:58:03.200]  Sure.
[02:58:03.200 --> 02:58:06.440]  I've hit an oak tree backwards at about 60 because a tornado blew me and my dad off
[02:58:06.440 --> 02:58:07.440]  the road.
[02:58:07.440 --> 02:58:11.080]  And I mean, it still hammered in about eight inches into the tree.
[02:58:11.080 --> 02:58:13.040]  I mean, it gouged a big thing out of it.
[02:58:13.040 --> 02:58:14.400]  It was actually two oak trees.
[02:58:14.400 --> 02:58:16.360]  I want a, one big one, one medium size.
[02:58:16.360 --> 02:58:17.920]  I mean, how, how tore up did the tree look?
[02:58:17.920 --> 02:58:19.640]  The tree didn't look particularly torn up.
[02:58:19.640 --> 02:58:23.720]  Because when I see from the photos, it came resting up against the tree, blew up the street,
[02:58:23.720 --> 02:58:25.800]  no skid marks up against the tree.
[02:58:25.800 --> 02:58:26.800]  Right.
[02:58:26.800 --> 02:58:31.200]  Maybe a millimeter gouge into it, but a large area.
[02:58:31.200 --> 02:58:32.200]  Right.
[02:58:32.200 --> 02:58:33.200]  We're going to come right back.
[02:58:33.200 --> 02:58:37.640]  I want to talk about how they got Glass-Steagall in the 30s and how we could get it back in
[02:58:37.640 --> 02:58:38.640]  place again.

[02:59:09.160 --> 02:59:10.680]  by the end of the summer.
[02:59:10.680 --> 02:59:12.400]  Wonder if there will really be a problem?

[02:59:51.800 --> 02:59:55.520]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.520 --> 03:00:21.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:43:38.460 --> 03:00:36.960]  you were telling me during the break before last about your research into how
[03:00:36.960 --> 03:00:40.920]  the bankers have been broken up before.
[03:00:40.920 --> 03:00:42.880]  Tell the audience about that, know me Prince?
[03:00:42.880 --> 03:00:47.480]  Yeah, I've been doing a lot of research for this book, the new one, All the President's
[03:00:47.480 --> 03:00:48.480]  Bankers.
[03:00:48.480 --> 03:00:52.160]  And I go back to Teddy Roosevelt, but through now and all the alliances between bankers
[03:00:52.160 --> 03:00:56.680]  and presidents and kind of what went on behind the scenes and how they sort of interact.
[03:00:56.680 --> 03:01:00.240]  And in particular Glass-Steagall, right, we've just come out of currently a financial crisis
[03:01:00.240 --> 03:01:03.800]  where banks have been made bigger rather than smaller, where they have been consolidated
[03:01:03.800 --> 03:01:08.800]  rather than split up and where we are therefore less stable as a global economy because of
[03:01:08.800 --> 03:01:09.800]  that.
[03:01:09.800 --> 03:01:13.120]  Back in the 30s, of course, there was a great depression following the crash in 1929 and
[03:01:13.120 --> 03:01:15.600]  a lot of shady deals that went into that crash.
[03:01:15.600 --> 03:01:20.280]  But the difference between then and now between FDR and Obama, who says he models himself
[03:01:20.280 --> 03:01:24.360]  after FDR, FDR also had a lot of friends who were bankers.
[03:01:24.360 --> 03:01:25.360]  He grew up with them.
[03:01:25.360 --> 03:01:26.360]  He hung out.
[03:01:26.360 --> 03:01:27.360]  They yotted.
[03:01:27.360 --> 03:01:29.520]  They knew each other for decades.
[03:01:29.520 --> 03:01:34.840]  But what he did was he understood that the banking system had to be stabilized.
[03:01:34.840 --> 03:01:38.400]  And bankers at the time, the two top bankers at the time, the head of what has now become
[03:01:38.400 --> 03:01:45.880]  Citigroup, Jim Perkins, who was head of National Citibank, and Winfrey Aldrich, who was in the
[03:01:45.880 --> 03:01:49.880]  Rockefeller family, but head of Chase at the time, went to FDR.
[03:01:49.880 --> 03:01:53.080]  They had a meeting two days after FDR took office.
[03:01:53.080 --> 03:01:58.280]  And they agreed, three of them, Winfrey wasn't there, National Citibank I was, that he was
[03:01:58.280 --> 03:02:01.680]  going to split up his bank before the legislation passed.
[03:02:01.680 --> 03:02:06.400]  They said, we will split up the investment and trading, the speculation side, from the
[03:02:06.400 --> 03:02:11.400]  commercial banking side that deals with real people and real deposits and real loans.
[03:02:11.400 --> 03:02:15.400]  Because we are facing a large problem and it will only get bigger if we do not do this.
[03:02:15.400 --> 03:02:18.120]  If we don't take the risk out of the banking system.
[03:02:18.120 --> 03:02:19.680]  So yeah, they were self-interested.
[03:02:19.680 --> 03:02:22.160]  But what FDR did was say, okay, I'm going to push that.
[03:02:22.160 --> 03:02:24.000]  The bankers were going to push that.
[03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:26.640]  The population was fine with that.
[03:02:26.640 --> 03:02:28.720]  They got deposit insurance out of it.
[03:02:28.720 --> 03:02:29.720]  Everybody was happy.
[03:02:29.720 --> 03:02:32.600]  And the system was stable for decades.
[03:02:32.600 --> 03:02:36.760]  You look at now, and we had a situation where the financial crisis was arguably bigger because
[03:02:36.760 --> 03:02:38.640]  it was more diffuse than what happened.
[03:02:38.640 --> 03:02:39.640]  Sure.
[03:02:39.640 --> 03:02:42.480]  And they're doing more of the same instead of even reversing in any way.
[03:02:42.480 --> 03:02:44.800]  And looking at this, for those that don't understand what we're talking about, they
[03:02:44.800 --> 03:02:48.400]  have fractional reserve banking in the regular banking system that already gives them unfair
[03:02:48.400 --> 03:02:49.400]  trade advantage.
[03:02:49.400 --> 03:02:50.400]  That's why they run everything.
[03:02:50.400 --> 03:02:55.680]  But they can always have these derivatives-type fraudulent, other type of speculative banking.
[03:02:55.680 --> 03:02:58.640]  You certainly want that to be on its own for people that want to go down to the race track
[03:02:58.640 --> 03:03:00.600]  and be involved in that.
[03:03:00.600 --> 03:03:05.240]  What they've done is they've involved everybody and the whole currency and the whole country
[03:03:05.240 --> 03:03:08.320]  and the whole world in their big fraud.
[03:03:08.320 --> 03:03:12.840]  And we're saying that needs to be at least separated off and they won't even do that.
[03:03:12.840 --> 03:03:13.840]  Right.
[03:03:13.840 --> 03:03:17.640]  And some bankers that had the opportunity, different legacy bankers, but had the opportunity
[03:03:17.640 --> 03:03:22.720]  to do this and save the system and corner off the risky stuff, did it then.
[03:03:22.720 --> 03:03:24.440]  And now they're not even considering doing it.
[03:03:24.440 --> 03:03:25.600]  Now they want to go away from that.
[03:03:25.600 --> 03:03:28.680]  Now they're lobbying against anything like that.
[03:03:28.680 --> 03:03:32.440]  But also, the president did nothing about that.
[03:03:32.440 --> 03:03:34.440]  He didn't say that the banks should be split out.
[03:03:34.440 --> 03:03:40.240]  He didn't say the rational thing to do rather than mingle some normal, everyday person's
[03:03:40.240 --> 03:03:46.360]  money with these giants who can speculate it away and then get subsidized where the
[03:03:46.360 --> 03:03:48.680]  normal person doesn't.
[03:03:48.680 --> 03:03:50.000]  No one's trying to do any of that.
[03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:52.040]  Very few people are trying to do anything that in Washington.
[03:03:52.040 --> 03:03:55.920]  It's not going to happen right now with the people that we have running the White House
[03:03:55.920 --> 03:03:57.120]  and running the banking system.
[03:03:57.120 --> 03:03:59.080]  It just won't happen like it did back then.
[03:03:59.080 --> 03:04:03.320]  And therefore, we're still in a less stable environment than we were, Ian, coming out
[03:04:03.320 --> 03:04:05.160]  of the Great Depression.
[03:04:05.160 --> 03:04:06.920]  In closing, look at carbon taxes.
[03:04:06.920 --> 03:04:11.000]  And there's a lot of real environmental issues with the carbon taxes, Goldman Sachs came
[03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:15.640]  up with it with Enron on record back in the mid-90s, Al Gore.
[03:04:15.640 --> 03:04:20.720]  And now they're saying, that'll fund things $100 trillion every decade to us, direct
[03:04:20.720 --> 03:04:22.240]  taxes.
[03:04:22.240 --> 03:04:25.440]  Let's do one more segment, come back and talk about what happened in Cyprus.
[03:04:25.440 --> 03:04:26.440]  You game to do that?
[03:04:26.440 --> 03:04:27.440]  Fantastic.
[03:04:27.440 --> 03:04:30.720]  Because I want to talk about what we've seen in Europe to understand what's coming for
[03:04:30.720 --> 03:04:31.720]  us down the road.
[03:04:31.720 --> 03:04:35.280]  We'll take a few calls for Enomi Prince here with us, George in Connecticut and others.
[03:04:35.280 --> 03:04:37.000]  And I've got other callers all over the map.
[03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:38.000]  I'll get to you.
[03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:39.000]  I promise to do it.
[03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:40.000]  We'll come back and answer that question.
[03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:44.040]  Do one more segment with her in overdrive that she's going to be interviewed for Obama
[03:04:44.040 --> 03:04:45.040]  Deception.
[03:04:45.040 --> 03:04:47.240]  You won't see that until November.
[03:04:47.240 --> 03:04:49.360]  EnomiPrinz.com is here.
[03:04:49.360 --> 03:04:52.520]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com.
[03:04:52.520 --> 03:04:53.520]  Stay with us.
[03:04:53.520 --> 03:04:54.520]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:54.520 --> 03:04:55.520]  Hello.
[03:04:55.520 --> 03:04:56.520]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:04:56.520 --> 03:04:57.520]  Myself.
[03:04:57.520 --> 03:04:58.520]  My family.
[03:04:58.520 --> 03:05:10.080]  The infowars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying
[03:05:10.080 --> 03:05:13.840]  our efforts against the globalist on every front.
[03:05:13.840 --> 03:05:17.720]  infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[03:05:17.720 --> 03:05:23.200]  But we can't do that without your help by getting the films, bumper stickers and t-shirts
[03:05:23.200 --> 03:05:24.200]  in infowars.com.
[03:05:24.200 --> 03:05:31.720]  You will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[03:05:31.720 --> 03:05:35.200]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:05:35.200 --> 03:05:40.080]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom
[03:05:40.080 --> 03:05:41.080]  and darkness.
[03:05:41.080 --> 03:05:48.840]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization
[03:05:48.840 --> 03:05:51.200]  and ultimate extermination.
[03:05:51.200 --> 03:05:59.880]  The war is here, it's an info war, the spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:05:59.880 --> 03:06:04.720]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[03:06:04.720 --> 03:06:05.720]  Box.
[03:06:05.720 --> 03:06:08.680]  I want you to know some very important information.
[03:06:08.680 --> 03:06:13.480]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[03:06:13.480 --> 03:06:17.760]  House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.
[03:06:17.760 --> 03:06:23.320]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[03:06:23.320 --> 03:06:28.400]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally
[03:06:28.400 --> 03:06:33.520]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[03:06:33.520 --> 03:06:34.680]  normal cell.
[03:06:34.680 --> 03:06:38.360]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune
[03:06:38.360 --> 03:06:42.440]  cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[03:06:42.440 --> 03:07:05.080]  Summer is here and nothing looks better than tanned skin and white teeth.
[03:07:05.080 --> 03:07:10.320]  Hi, I'm Jonathan Greenhut, the CEO of Power Swabs and if you want to have whiter teeth

[03:08:02.480 --> 03:08:09.040]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.040 --> 03:08:12.480]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:12.480 --> 03:08:18.880]  All right, folks, Alex Jones here back live in Overdrive, some stations carry it.
[03:08:18.880 --> 03:08:23.280]  If your local affiliate doesn't, you can just go to infowars.com forward slash show to find
[03:08:23.280 --> 03:08:28.880]  all the free iPhones, Android app, the podcast, the free video feed, all of it right there

[03:08:36.680 --> 03:08:41.400]  So many times folks say, I saw an infowars.com bumper sticker or my neighbor told me to turn
[03:08:41.400 --> 03:08:46.160]  to this local AMR FM affiliate or somebody sent me the link to your podcast or somebody
[03:08:46.160 --> 03:08:50.880]  sent me a link to the iTunes or somebody sent me a link to their membership at prisonplanet.tv
[03:08:50.880 --> 03:08:54.440]  and I logged on and used it, it's incredible, it woke me up.
[03:08:54.440 --> 03:09:02.640]  Every subject, every expert you can imagine, I forgot to plug in the last hour that we have
[03:09:02.640 --> 03:09:06.880]  a very special guest joining us tomorrow.
[03:09:06.880 --> 03:09:08.120]  For two hours, is it?
[03:09:08.120 --> 03:09:09.680]  This is going to be legendary?
[03:09:09.680 --> 03:09:16.920]  Well, he told me, oh, at least an hour, but it is nailed down for tomorrow, 100% nailed
[03:09:16.920 --> 03:09:23.200]  down, 100% nailed down.
[03:09:23.200 --> 03:09:26.440]  The fish is on the line, but not in the boat.
[03:09:26.440 --> 03:09:33.800]  Anyways, I need to stop right there, act like Ted Knight from Caddy Shack sometimes, know
[03:09:33.800 --> 03:09:39.040]  me friends continuing here, getting into more serious issues, side person what we saw there
[03:09:39.040 --> 03:09:43.840]  and now they're going, yeah, maybe we need bail ins here, direct tax for the bankers
[03:09:43.840 --> 03:09:49.680]  and then Congress QE3, 80 something billion a month was 40 billion, then 85 billion disappearing
[03:09:49.680 --> 03:09:50.680]  into a black hole.
[03:09:50.680 --> 03:09:56.040]  Congress says, where does it go, the Treasury says, just shut up, smacks him across the
[03:09:56.040 --> 03:10:01.120]  cheek, what is going on with Cyprus, what is going on with just grabbing people's bank
[03:10:01.120 --> 03:10:04.040]  accounts now?
[03:10:04.040 --> 03:10:08.640]  The fact is that when there's so much speculation in a country and there's so much foreign capital
[03:10:08.640 --> 03:10:13.080]  going in that they want to basically try to take the money back from individuals who are
[03:10:13.080 --> 03:10:14.080]  on the ground.
[03:10:14.080 --> 03:10:18.000]  This goes to whether you're a small depositor or whether you're in those situations slightly
[03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:22.980]  larger depositors and it's the kind of thing that if you have a very destabilized global
[03:10:22.980 --> 03:10:28.000]  financial system is a serious concern for whether it's the United States or whether
[03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:31.560]  it's Cyprus or anywhere else and it goes back to what we were saying before, as long as
[03:10:31.560 --> 03:10:38.120]  you have accounts, normal regular money in banks that is co-mingled in an institution
[03:10:38.120 --> 03:10:42.640]  that can also go about and create all sorts of havoc and do all sorts of speculation and
[03:10:42.640 --> 03:10:47.160]  take on all sorts of risk, the money on the table is the easiest place to go unless of
[03:10:47.160 --> 03:10:51.040]  course the Fed is funding you and then it's sort of a mutual situation and that's what
[03:10:51.040 --> 03:10:52.880]  again the Fed is doing as well.
[03:10:52.880 --> 03:10:59.240]  The Fed's balance sheet has grown by 10 times since before the financial crisis of 2008
[03:10:59.240 --> 03:11:00.240]  to now.
[03:11:00.240 --> 03:11:07.600]  They now have a $2.6, $2.7 trillion dollar-sized balance sheet of treasury bonds buying debt.
[03:11:07.600 --> 03:11:08.600]  Treasury creates debt.
[03:11:08.600 --> 03:11:13.920]  The Fed takes it on their books and more than $1.2 trillion of mortgage back security.
[03:11:13.920 --> 03:11:16.880]  Just a few years ago they didn't have any.
[03:11:16.880 --> 03:11:20.880]  So they're basically continuing to subsidize the risk of the system.
[03:11:20.880 --> 03:11:25.760]  But the other place to go to get the risk is the people's accounts.
[03:11:25.760 --> 03:11:26.760]  So it's really...
[03:11:26.760 --> 03:11:29.880]  What do you think of Corzine not getting in trouble for Immigrant Global now officially?
[03:11:29.880 --> 03:11:31.480]  Well, I knew that.
[03:11:31.480 --> 03:11:34.480]  But I mean now why not do it more?
[03:11:34.480 --> 03:11:35.480]  I mean, you know...
[03:11:35.480 --> 03:11:39.880]  Yeah, he's in the same mutual reinforcement society.
[03:11:39.880 --> 03:11:42.840]  Is that how they'll destroy the Ponzi scheme though as they'll just go?
[03:11:42.840 --> 03:11:45.840]  So far they destroy confidence?
[03:11:45.840 --> 03:11:49.880]  That can help because hopefully individuals will think twice before putting their money
[03:11:49.880 --> 03:11:53.440]  in something like Immigrant Global and actually looking at what the alliances are, the people
[03:11:53.440 --> 03:11:59.400]  that run these funds and that run these investment management companies and everything else and
[03:11:59.400 --> 03:12:02.120]  be a little bit more prudent about their own money.
[03:12:02.120 --> 03:12:05.920]  But it does take people getting more knowledgeable about who's running what they have and where
[03:12:05.920 --> 03:12:10.040]  they're putting their investments and not going into something like a John Corzine...
[03:12:10.040 --> 03:12:13.520]  It took less than a year and a half for that guy to wreck that company.
[03:12:13.520 --> 03:12:17.200]  Well, he was making, what, 40 to one bets with other people's money?
[03:12:17.200 --> 03:12:19.000]  I mean, what a lunatic.
[03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:25.880]  But in the case of Gerald Salente, he'd been, you know, had a Gold Brokerage account that
[03:12:25.880 --> 03:12:26.880]  had a private account.
[03:12:26.880 --> 03:12:28.800]  It's like a bank account for those that don't know.
[03:12:28.800 --> 03:12:31.400]  He'd had that for 30 plus years.
[03:12:31.400 --> 03:12:33.120]  He didn't even know six months before.
[03:12:33.120 --> 03:12:36.000]  Nobody told him his, that firm had been bought.
[03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:37.960]  So I mean, how do you even...
[03:12:37.960 --> 03:12:38.960]  It's hard.
[03:12:38.960 --> 03:12:39.960]  It's like you have to be vigilant all the time.
[03:12:39.960 --> 03:12:40.960]  If it's yours, you have to be vigilant.
[03:12:40.960 --> 03:12:41.960]  And not that Salente isn't.
[03:12:41.960 --> 03:12:44.680]  I mean, he's a very intelligent man.
[03:12:44.680 --> 03:12:46.640]  But these things do happen in the night.
[03:12:46.640 --> 03:12:51.520]  You know, Chris Flowers, ex-Goldman person, you know, hires John Corzine, ex-Goldman person,
[03:12:51.520 --> 03:12:55.360]  you know, Corzine's bored, he's done for a while with public office and he goes in
[03:12:55.360 --> 03:13:00.760]  and he tanks this company and court ends off over a billion dollars in misappropriated funds
[03:13:00.760 --> 03:13:01.760]  to keep it going.
[03:13:01.760 --> 03:13:02.760]  I mean, he kept...
[03:13:02.760 --> 03:13:04.440]  Was that really a theft though?
[03:13:04.440 --> 03:13:07.360]  Maybe he didn't make 40 to one bet by accident.
[03:13:07.360 --> 03:13:08.800]  Who was it transferred to?
[03:13:08.800 --> 03:13:09.800]  Maybe it was on purpose.
[03:13:09.800 --> 03:13:12.120]  Maybe it was a bank robbery.
[03:13:12.120 --> 03:13:14.520]  Well, some of it wound up getting returned.
[03:13:14.520 --> 03:13:20.320]  But what it was, was him making a bet of some sort that was wrong on in order for him, like,
[03:13:20.320 --> 03:13:25.360]  you know, a gambling addict at Las Vegas, you're doubling down, you're doubling down,
[03:13:25.360 --> 03:13:28.320]  you're doubling down, you're taking your grandma's money, you're taking your kid's money, you're
[03:13:28.320 --> 03:13:29.320]  taking...
[03:13:29.320 --> 03:13:32.240]  And you're just trying to play and play and play until you hope you get out of it and
[03:13:32.240 --> 03:13:33.480]  he couldn't get out of it.
[03:13:33.480 --> 03:13:37.920]  But because it wasn't his money, because it was his client's money, in that respect,
[03:13:37.920 --> 03:13:41.200]  he was stealing from them in order to keep his...
[03:13:41.200 --> 03:13:43.960]  Why don't we give him a peace prize?
[03:13:43.960 --> 03:13:44.960]  Like Obama?
[03:13:44.960 --> 03:13:47.200]  Well, yeah, I mean, Bush was just giving a peace award.
[03:13:47.200 --> 03:13:55.440]  I think we ought to give him a good, spender, conscientious financial management award.
[03:13:55.440 --> 03:13:56.440]  The press has been...
[03:13:56.440 --> 03:13:57.440]  I better watch it.
[03:13:57.440 --> 03:13:58.440]  They may actually give him one.
[03:13:58.440 --> 03:13:59.440]  Yeah.
[03:13:59.440 --> 03:14:00.440]  They're happy.
[03:14:00.440 --> 03:14:01.440]  His friends have been on to say he did nothing wrong.
[03:14:01.440 --> 03:14:02.440]  He did nothing wrong.
[03:14:02.440 --> 03:14:03.440]  He did nothing wrong.
[03:14:03.440 --> 03:14:04.440]  Yeah, so what?
[03:14:04.440 --> 03:14:05.440]  He made a bad bet and misappropriated...
[03:14:05.440 --> 03:14:07.880]  Because they all want to set the precedent to do whatever they want.
[03:14:07.880 --> 03:14:08.880]  They don't want to be looked at themselves.
[03:14:08.880 --> 03:14:13.640]  I mean, J.P. Morgan, Chase had a lot of the trusts that were in charge of keeping that
[03:14:13.640 --> 03:14:16.640]  segregated money and they allowed it to be unsegregated.
[03:14:16.640 --> 03:14:18.960]  Here's what makes me maddest.
[03:14:18.960 --> 03:14:23.720]  Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, if you look, are the number one and number two biggest funders
[03:14:23.720 --> 03:14:24.720]  of shadow government.
[03:14:24.720 --> 03:14:28.280]  They fund the Bilderberg Group, their own record.
[03:14:28.280 --> 03:14:29.920]  They fund its charity.
[03:14:29.920 --> 03:14:33.040]  They fund the carbon taxes.
[03:14:33.040 --> 03:14:38.240]  They fund making you live in a 200 square foot apartment to actuary the taxes, but then
[03:14:38.240 --> 03:14:39.480]  they're all exempt.
[03:14:39.480 --> 03:14:41.440]  They don't want just all the money.
[03:14:41.440 --> 03:14:43.000]  They want to wreck everybody else.
[03:14:43.000 --> 03:14:44.000]  These are real scum.
[03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:45.000]  They want the power.
[03:14:45.000 --> 03:14:46.000]  At the top.
[03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:47.000]  Yeah, and I hate their guts.
[03:14:47.000 --> 03:14:48.000]  I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[03:14:48.000 --> 03:14:49.000]  They don't need to all be locked up.
[03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:50.000]  I'll say that right now.
[03:14:50.000 --> 03:14:51.000]  They're the ones that run it.
[03:14:51.000 --> 03:14:52.520]  They're the ones that pull the triggers.
[03:14:52.520 --> 03:14:54.120]  They're the ones that push the buttons.
[03:14:54.120 --> 03:14:56.200]  They're the ones that run the wars.
[03:14:56.200 --> 03:14:57.720]  These are the bad guys.
[03:14:57.720 --> 03:15:02.720]  Yeah, and they control and they influence and they have that power.
[03:15:02.720 --> 03:15:08.000]  They maintain it by their relationships with these institutions, with the federal government,
[03:15:08.000 --> 03:15:09.880]  with governments in other countries, and so forth.
[03:15:09.880 --> 03:15:14.760]  They have the ability to manipulate the entire global financial and economic...
[03:15:14.760 --> 03:15:16.640]  Well, people are always asking, who's behind it?
[03:15:16.640 --> 03:15:17.640]  Who's behind it?
[03:15:17.640 --> 03:15:18.640]  This is it.
[03:15:18.640 --> 03:15:22.640]  Every time I end up digging into the deep ebbs rat hole, no matter what it is, it's the
[03:15:22.640 --> 03:15:29.840]  big six megabanks and a bunch of degenerate royalty whose wealth is all tied up.
[03:15:29.840 --> 03:15:31.440]  Their wealth is partially in these banks.
[03:15:31.440 --> 03:15:32.560]  I mean, it is all connected.
[03:15:32.560 --> 03:15:35.360]  That's part of the reason I went and wrote the book that I'm currently revising right
[03:15:35.360 --> 03:15:36.360]  now.
[03:15:36.360 --> 03:15:37.360]  It'll be out next year.
[03:15:37.360 --> 03:15:38.360]  I want it to go back.
[03:15:38.360 --> 03:15:44.000]  I believe that it is the private bankers running the government to a large extent, or at least
[03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:47.560]  in alliance with the government, making the bigger decisions and that they work together
[03:15:47.560 --> 03:15:48.560]  to decide how they're...
[03:15:48.560 --> 03:15:51.680]  And they're all a bunch of arrogant SOBs.
[03:15:51.680 --> 03:15:55.680]  And many of them went to the schools together and, again, he wanted to go and did everything
[03:15:55.680 --> 03:15:56.680]  together.
[03:15:56.680 --> 03:15:59.920]  They're from the same backgrounds and they mutually enforce each other.
[03:15:59.920 --> 03:16:00.920]  And this has been happening...
[03:16:00.920 --> 03:16:01.920]  How arrogant.
[03:16:01.920 --> 03:16:05.920]  I don't see their arrogance on television and in their writings, but I'm doing God's
[03:16:05.920 --> 03:16:09.840]  work with Jamie Dimon said, how arrogant are they in person?
[03:16:09.840 --> 03:16:15.440]  I couldn't imagine being an evil jerk and then no one can hold me accountable.
[03:16:15.440 --> 03:16:20.760]  The ones I know, the people I personally spend time with, like Lord Blankfein in his office,
[03:16:20.760 --> 03:16:24.800]  they're just as arrogant in person as they come across on TV.
[03:16:24.800 --> 03:16:27.640]  If you watch them on TV and don't believe they're arrogant, you probably won't think
[03:16:27.640 --> 03:16:28.640]  they're an arrogant person.
[03:16:28.640 --> 03:16:29.640]  Tell a story.
[03:16:29.640 --> 03:16:30.640]  I mean, how are they in person?
[03:16:30.640 --> 03:16:37.520]  You know, they have the ability to, you know, tell you a little story.
[03:16:37.520 --> 03:16:41.280]  When I was working at Goldman, before Lloyd Blankfein was as high as he was, but he was
[03:16:41.280 --> 03:16:43.480]  running a division.
[03:16:43.480 --> 03:16:47.920]  And basically there was an international trade going on and a fellow who was working
[03:16:47.920 --> 03:16:54.280]  with a little higher than me basically ran to Lloyd Blankfein's office while I was told
[03:16:54.280 --> 03:16:58.360]  to go the other way to get there and to basically talk about this trade and Lloyd just had this
[03:16:58.360 --> 03:17:05.840]  ability to just shut down any conversation about any type of risk or anything that might
[03:17:05.840 --> 03:17:07.200]  be going on with this transaction.
[03:17:07.200 --> 03:17:13.120]  Just listen to what he wanted to listen to for the person that he wanted to hear the
[03:17:13.120 --> 03:17:14.120]  information from.
[03:17:14.120 --> 03:17:16.120]  And that's just, that's how power happens.
[03:17:16.120 --> 03:17:22.200]  You reinforce each other, whether it's a subordinate, whether it's a superior, you reinforce the
[03:17:22.200 --> 03:17:27.760]  story along the way and you shut down and you descend a conversation on any other side
[03:17:27.760 --> 03:17:28.800]  of that.
[03:17:28.800 --> 03:17:30.720]  And that's where your arrogance shows through.
[03:17:30.720 --> 03:17:34.280]  And then you act like you're doing one thing when you really know it's another.
[03:17:34.280 --> 03:17:35.280]  Everybody just plays dumb.
[03:17:35.280 --> 03:17:37.360]  Oh, gee, what are we doing in it?
[03:17:37.360 --> 03:17:39.120]  You don't look under the rock a lot either.
[03:17:39.120 --> 03:17:40.120]  You feel you don't have to.
[03:17:40.120 --> 03:17:45.120]  If you're high enough up, if you're Blankfein or Diamond, you don't know, you're not hanging
[03:17:45.120 --> 03:17:47.480]  out in Stockton with Lloyd Blankfein.
[03:17:47.480 --> 03:17:51.480]  No, no, you're like Hitler in the Wolf's Lair going, I could take down the Russians.
[03:17:51.480 --> 03:17:53.120]  You just don't care about it.
[03:17:53.120 --> 03:17:54.120]  Or Napoleon.
[03:17:54.120 --> 03:17:56.080]  Nobody can beat me.
[03:17:56.080 --> 03:18:02.320]  And it's been shown recently that they have been right by the fact that the biggest bankers
[03:18:02.320 --> 03:18:05.520]  are still in charge of the biggest banks, which have grown.
[03:18:05.520 --> 03:18:07.400]  And so why shouldn't they start crisis?
[03:18:07.400 --> 03:18:09.960]  Why shouldn't they start taking your private bank accounts?
[03:18:09.960 --> 03:18:11.720]  Why shouldn't they take your pension funds?
[03:18:11.720 --> 03:18:15.040]  When they take the cops pension funds, the cops will just go beat our brains out that
[03:18:15.040 --> 03:18:17.240]  much harder to get more money.
[03:18:17.240 --> 03:18:18.760]  They'll probably think them.
[03:18:18.760 --> 03:18:22.240]  Everybody's destabilized, which is why at the very least, these institutions need to
[03:18:22.240 --> 03:18:23.800]  be made smaller and need to be broken up.
[03:18:23.800 --> 03:18:27.320]  So at the very least, our deposits, our money isn't backing their risk.
[03:18:27.320 --> 03:18:29.080]  Real fast question from George in Connecticut.
[03:18:29.080 --> 03:18:31.520]  George, what's your question for Nomi Prince?
[03:18:31.520 --> 03:18:39.720]  Nomi, I'm wondering if we could take back the money in some form of state banks or maybe
[03:18:39.720 --> 03:18:46.400]  re-take a new bank that basically from the Fed reserves it as their bank and produce
[03:18:46.400 --> 03:18:48.240]  the money only for Main Street.
[03:18:48.240 --> 03:18:51.520]  Yeah, let's skip this network right on to the bottom of the hour and that's it.
[03:18:51.520 --> 03:18:52.640]  That's a great question.
[03:18:52.640 --> 03:18:57.080]  Their solution, state banks, obviously we try to go to credit unions, they just shut
[03:18:57.080 --> 03:18:58.080]  those down.
[03:18:58.080 --> 03:19:00.080]  But I think we have to make those choices.
[03:19:00.080 --> 03:19:04.560]  Where we put money, before this big game of derivatives, before these banks were as big
[03:19:04.560 --> 03:19:09.560]  as they are when they were just slightly smaller but equally as powerful in a less dangerous
[03:19:09.560 --> 03:19:15.480]  financial world, they tried to take over the smaller banks and it's up to individuals to
[03:19:15.480 --> 03:19:20.520]  decide where they keep their money to a large extent, whether that state or local, even
[03:19:20.520 --> 03:19:25.320]  if credit unions are being bought up, it's still a personal individual decision.
[03:19:25.320 --> 03:19:28.760]  Now, it is sometimes hard to get out of the bigger banks if you have accounts with them,
[03:19:28.760 --> 03:19:31.440]  if you have a mortgage and it's attached to your credit card and everything else.
[03:19:31.440 --> 03:19:34.760]  So the way to start legging out, if there are certain elements that you have attached
[03:19:34.760 --> 03:19:39.600]  to a larger bank, is to start like out of the smaller things, to start putting your
[03:19:39.600 --> 03:19:43.920]  savings if you have a savings account into a smaller bank.
[03:19:43.920 --> 03:19:47.640]  Take a look at where rates are a little bit higher than the big banks, they basically
[03:19:47.640 --> 03:19:50.320]  charge higher fees than the smaller banks or than the state banks.
[03:19:50.320 --> 03:19:56.000]  The state banks have been shown, for example North Dakota, they've been shown to be less
[03:19:56.000 --> 03:20:01.040]  risky with people's funds because they don't have the big government banking and they aren't
[03:20:01.040 --> 03:20:02.040]  involved in the derivatives.
[03:20:02.040 --> 03:20:05.280]  Plus they're not as air again, they give you better interest rates, better service.
[03:20:05.280 --> 03:20:09.600]  They care about the local economy and about the state economy and that means that your
[03:20:09.600 --> 03:20:12.760]  bank account actually matters more to where you live as well.
[03:20:12.760 --> 03:20:18.000]  So again, I was talking about mutual enforcement at the big powerful level, this is kind of
[03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:22.120]  a mutual enforcement at the smaller, more local and more state level.
[03:20:22.120 --> 03:20:23.120]  Absolutely.
[03:20:23.120 --> 03:20:28.440]  I've had a bank account with one of the big banks since I was in high school, that's
[03:20:28.440 --> 03:20:29.760]  what my parents set up for me.
[03:20:29.760 --> 03:20:32.880]  Plus the idea is, well, if it's a bank all over, you can do stuff all over.
[03:20:32.880 --> 03:20:36.040]  But over the years, we brought that down to almost nothing.
[03:20:36.040 --> 03:20:41.320]  And then we just use it so when we go out of the country or something, we have an international
[03:20:41.320 --> 03:20:43.440]  bank, but there's basically no money in there.
[03:20:43.440 --> 03:20:44.440]  Right.
[03:20:44.440 --> 03:20:45.440]  I have a mortgage out of big bank.
[03:20:45.440 --> 03:20:47.680]  I've had it for a long time.
[03:20:47.680 --> 03:20:49.520]  I admit it.
[03:20:49.520 --> 03:20:51.720]  But I don't really keep money there.
[03:20:51.720 --> 03:20:56.760]  Yeah, so it's not even like you have to do this right now, just set up a new bank account
[03:20:56.760 --> 03:21:01.200]  or put your paycheck in the local bank and just move away from the big guy.
[03:21:01.200 --> 03:21:02.200]  Exactly.
[03:21:02.200 --> 03:21:03.200]  It's incredible.
[03:21:03.200 --> 03:21:04.200]  Let's take another call.
[03:21:04.200 --> 03:21:05.200]  Lazarus in Florida.
[03:21:05.200 --> 03:21:06.200]  He's going to be on a different subject.
[03:21:06.200 --> 03:21:09.920]  Thanks for holding Lazarus and then Ernest and Mark and Scotland and that'll be it.
[03:21:09.920 --> 03:21:10.920]  Go ahead.
[03:21:10.920 --> 03:21:11.920]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[03:21:11.920 --> 03:21:12.920]  Hey, Brent.
[03:21:12.920 --> 03:21:22.040]  I have information about the secret improvement camp.
[03:21:22.040 --> 03:21:28.200]  Oh, you mean the emergency center's establishment act or the civilian and labor camp program
[03:21:28.200 --> 03:21:30.320]  because those are public.
[03:21:30.320 --> 03:21:38.720]  I was given five years, you know, I was young and I did stupid stuff and I was given a sentence
[03:21:38.720 --> 03:21:41.000]  of five years.
[03:21:41.000 --> 03:21:46.440]  I ended up doing eight months if I kept my mouth shut.
[03:21:46.440 --> 03:21:47.440]  Oh, wait a minute.
[03:21:47.440 --> 03:21:52.480]  So you were in the civilian and labor camp program because if you sign that they usually
[03:21:52.480 --> 03:21:54.080]  cut it by two thirds.
[03:21:54.080 --> 03:21:55.080]  Wow.
[03:21:55.080 --> 03:21:57.400]  I want to get your name and number and talk to you off air.
[03:21:57.400 --> 03:22:01.060]  For those that don't know, it was a secret program to prime the pump for concentration
[03:22:01.060 --> 03:22:04.360]  camps in America that you can look up in the eighties that came out and started under
[03:22:04.360 --> 03:22:08.560]  under the Reagan administration, the civilian and labor camp program, Clinton hit it in
[03:22:08.560 --> 03:22:11.520]  plain view and 97 declassified it.
[03:22:11.520 --> 03:22:15.320]  But it's where the army runs it with state and federal prisoners.
[03:22:15.320 --> 03:22:21.040]  And these are real secret camps, but you go do work on them by waiving your rights.
[03:22:21.040 --> 03:22:26.320]  They almost use them like Camp X-ray in Guantanamo where they actually create jihadi terrorists.
[03:22:26.320 --> 03:22:27.320]  It's the other way around.
[03:22:27.320 --> 03:22:33.120]  They actually bring in criminals or people in these camps to create clandestine operatives.
[03:22:33.120 --> 03:22:36.120]  This is a heavily classified area we're getting into right now.
[03:22:36.120 --> 03:22:40.800]  Sir, so hold on, what did you go to jail for and tell us about the civilian and labor camp
[03:22:40.800 --> 03:22:41.800]  you were in?
[03:22:41.800 --> 03:22:47.840]  I was there, I was there for grand theft auto.
[03:22:47.840 --> 03:22:55.520]  And like I said, I'm not proud of that, but that's why I was put in there.
[03:22:55.520 --> 03:23:04.520]  They actually black bagged you to get you to this area and I mean, I don't really want
[03:23:04.520 --> 03:23:07.680]  to say where the area was online on the air.
[03:23:07.680 --> 03:23:09.840]  Well, we know where the 12 original camps are.
[03:23:09.840 --> 03:23:12.680]  Well, this one was in Florida, so I don't know.
[03:23:12.680 --> 03:23:13.680]  Yeah, no.
[03:23:13.680 --> 03:23:14.680]  It's listed.
[03:23:14.680 --> 03:23:15.680]  Okay.
[03:23:15.680 --> 03:23:21.000]  We've actually got it on screen for people, and they hide it in plain view like it's no
[03:23:21.000 --> 03:23:22.000]  big deal.
[03:23:22.000 --> 03:23:23.000]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:23:23.000 --> 03:23:24.000]  Exactly.
[03:23:24.000 --> 03:23:30.240]  They gave me eight months and so you had to sign an agreement.
[03:23:30.240 --> 03:23:33.160]  See, what they're doing is to not make it completely illegal.
[03:23:33.160 --> 03:23:37.760]  You wave your rights under contract to go to a secret camp, and they put them on huge
[03:23:37.760 --> 03:23:39.600]  bases off on the corner.
[03:23:39.600 --> 03:23:42.960]  So sir, describe what you did at this camp.
[03:23:42.960 --> 03:23:49.040]  Basically, meaningless labor.
[03:23:49.040 --> 03:23:53.440]  They wouldn't give us weed lacquers or anything, so you know, just like in the…
[03:23:53.440 --> 03:23:54.440]  Yo-yos.
[03:23:54.440 --> 03:23:55.440]  Cool hand loop.
[03:23:55.440 --> 03:24:00.760]  You got these swing blades that you had to go out on the side of the road with.
[03:24:00.760 --> 03:24:02.760]  That's a yo-yo-yo.
[03:24:02.760 --> 03:24:10.840]  And fight fires, they made us do, because it was a national state park that this was
[03:24:10.840 --> 03:24:11.840]  going on in.
[03:24:11.840 --> 03:24:12.840]  Yeah.
[03:24:12.840 --> 03:24:15.440]  And by the way, and they told you it was secret, right?
[03:24:15.440 --> 03:24:21.240]  They told us it was secret and that it was a state-run fund, yet all the tags on all
[03:24:21.240 --> 03:24:23.920]  the vehicles were government.
[03:24:23.920 --> 03:24:25.520]  And let me expand on this.
[03:24:25.520 --> 03:24:27.760]  Did you go work for private firms?
[03:24:27.760 --> 03:24:28.760]  No, sir.
[03:24:28.760 --> 03:24:30.760]  Well, I don't know.
[03:24:30.760 --> 03:24:34.200]  Again, I wasn't privy to that information.
[03:24:34.200 --> 03:24:35.200]  Yeah.
[03:24:35.200 --> 03:24:38.640]  Well, they first had 12 camps starting in the 80s, like Wikipedia says it started in
[03:24:38.640 --> 03:24:39.640]  97.
[03:24:39.640 --> 03:24:41.160]  Notice before you put that up, I said 97.
[03:24:41.160 --> 03:24:45.400]  97 is when it was made official in the Federal Register.
[03:24:45.400 --> 03:24:50.360]  But well, you're lucky you weren't into some of the really nasty stuff, buddy, because
[03:24:50.360 --> 03:24:53.400]  like if you were involved in murder or something or something like that, you might have been
[03:24:53.400 --> 03:24:54.840]  recruited to be a government hitman.
[03:24:54.840 --> 03:24:59.520]  And I mean folks, this government is so out of control of people, even the stuff that
[03:24:59.520 --> 03:25:01.300]  was going on at these bases.
[03:25:01.300 --> 03:25:04.520]  So anything else you want to add about working at the, I don't know why you're, it's not
[03:25:04.520 --> 03:25:06.640]  even that big of a secret.
[03:25:06.640 --> 03:25:09.360]  I mean, most of it's public.
[03:25:09.360 --> 03:25:13.760]  What particular Florida National Park were you on?
[03:25:13.760 --> 03:25:16.600]  This was in Jonathan Dickinson State Park.
[03:25:16.600 --> 03:25:18.960]  Oh, State Park, yeah.
[03:25:18.960 --> 03:25:28.960]  And not only that, but there were also underground bunkers for food, water, et cetera, throughout
[03:25:28.960 --> 03:25:36.560]  that park, that there were people working at full-time, and I'm talking full-time, and
[03:25:36.560 --> 03:25:37.560]  there were others.
[03:25:37.560 --> 03:25:38.560]  No, I hear you.
[03:25:38.560 --> 03:25:43.760]  And this is all a test to create the infrastructure, to prime the military, to run real camps
[03:25:43.760 --> 03:25:49.560]  in the future, which they're now openly establishing, and the new Army Manual 2010 says, for your
[03:25:49.560 --> 03:25:52.560]  reeducation, you will be sent to these.
[03:25:52.560 --> 03:25:58.200]  Yeah, that's, well, you know, I got out easy on eight months.
[03:25:58.200 --> 03:26:06.720]  And I thought it was a blessing until I, you know, started, until I woke up and realized
[03:26:06.720 --> 03:26:09.760]  that, you know, this is much bigger than myself.
[03:26:09.760 --> 03:26:12.480]  Now, no, you're just priming the pump, and they admitted that.
[03:26:12.480 --> 03:26:18.540]  That came out the Miami Herald, actually, in 1986, was this was to condition the police
[03:26:18.540 --> 03:26:19.540]  and military.
[03:26:19.540 --> 03:26:20.540]  It was normal.
[03:26:20.540 --> 03:26:22.240]  See, it's all about brainwashing them.
[03:26:22.240 --> 03:26:24.600]  But now they're going, oh, by the way, now we're going to have political dissidents.
[03:26:24.600 --> 03:26:25.600]  We black bag here.
[03:26:25.600 --> 03:26:28.320]  Everybody's like, well, it's secret, they agree to be here.
[03:26:28.320 --> 03:26:29.320]  No, you don't.
[03:26:29.320 --> 03:26:33.280]  I love it, man, this country is so loving.
[03:26:33.280 --> 03:26:34.280]  Thank you, Lazarus.
[03:26:34.280 --> 03:26:37.080]  You ought to do a YouTube video about it and tell your story.
[03:26:37.080 --> 03:26:38.080]  God bless you.
[03:26:38.080 --> 03:26:40.840]  If you're a radio listener, we're putting all this on screen while we were talking.
[03:26:40.840 --> 03:26:42.720]  I don't make any of this up.
[03:26:42.720 --> 03:26:46.200]  Let's talk to Mark in Scotland, you're on the air with Nomi Prince.
[03:26:46.200 --> 03:26:47.200]  Go ahead.
[03:26:47.200 --> 03:26:48.200]  How you doing, buddy?
[03:26:48.200 --> 03:26:49.200]  Good.
[03:26:49.200 --> 03:26:50.200]  Go ahead.
[03:26:50.200 --> 03:26:58.160]  I've got two questions for you, and one of them is, I would like to know generally how
[03:26:58.160 --> 03:27:01.560]  much this affects the whole of the UK, Israel, and America.
[03:27:01.560 --> 03:27:06.120]  You're under the exact same program, the whole, the programs are all identical with just simple
[03:27:06.120 --> 03:27:10.040]  name variations in some cases in the Anglo-American Empire.
[03:27:10.040 --> 03:27:14.880]  That means all former Commonwealth countries and the United States are under the same system.
[03:27:14.880 --> 03:27:20.320]  Yeah, I gathered that, but we've not been having the drills with you guys, but the second
[03:27:20.320 --> 03:27:25.360]  question we'll cover that is, I've been realizing there's a lot of Islam being brought to the
[03:27:25.360 --> 03:27:29.560]  UK over the last year and a half now, and I don't know if you've been reading the newspaper
[03:27:29.560 --> 03:27:32.800]  with the, the rugby and whatnot.
[03:27:32.800 --> 03:27:37.400]  Yeah, no, that's part of the class of civilizations that PNAC wrote about, where they're going
[03:27:37.400 --> 03:27:42.120]  to only fund the radical Muslims, bring in as many as possible, and then basically let
[03:27:42.120 --> 03:27:45.000]  them do whatever they want while setting up patsies.
[03:27:45.000 --> 03:27:49.160]  It's all part of the class of civilizations that PNAC wrote about, and I appreciate your
[03:27:49.160 --> 03:27:50.160]  call.
[03:27:50.160 --> 03:27:51.160]  That's a good way to end.
[03:27:51.160 --> 03:27:58.080]  What do you make of the open funding of radical extremists in Al Qaeda against Libya and Syria?
[03:27:58.080 --> 03:28:04.160]  You know, I, it's not really my main topic, but I, but I, I'll say that, you know, going
[03:28:04.160 --> 03:28:08.680]  back to talking about the banks and in, in those areas, that in a lot of the nations
[03:28:08.680 --> 03:28:15.120]  where there is the most clashes, they tend to be the areas that, and I, I just actually
[03:28:15.120 --> 03:28:18.880]  revised this chapter on the Cold War, the 1950s chapter, which is when a lot of these
[03:28:18.880 --> 03:28:23.600]  outposts actually happened, and when Chase in particular set up outposts in the Middle
[03:28:23.600 --> 03:28:28.160]  East National City Bank, which is now city group a little bit less, and actually hightailed
[03:28:28.160 --> 03:28:33.040]  it to find places where they could create sort of financial service outposts.
[03:28:33.040 --> 03:28:39.640]  Sure, they love to destroy, in what was happening on the government side, and therefore support
[03:28:39.640 --> 03:28:43.800]  where they thought they could make the most profit, where they thought they would be most
[03:28:43.800 --> 03:28:47.680]  protected by both the U.S. government and whatever government was in power in any of
[03:28:47.680 --> 03:28:48.680]  the countries.
[03:28:48.680 --> 03:28:49.680]  Sure.
[03:28:49.680 --> 03:28:50.680]  And it's just kind of continued since then.
[03:28:50.680 --> 03:28:55.000]  Sure, bottom line, the people running our government love dictators and oppression.
[03:28:55.000 --> 03:28:56.560]  What do you think they want to do here in America?
[03:28:56.560 --> 03:29:01.080]  It doesn't matter what administration's in, they work for corporations that are totally
[03:29:01.080 --> 03:29:06.200]  cutthroat and criminal, and I don't know how it ends until we stand up and say we're
[03:29:06.200 --> 03:29:07.560]  not going to be slaves.
[03:29:07.560 --> 03:29:11.160]  But people think laying down is how you get through life.
[03:29:11.160 --> 03:29:16.520]  Yeah, I mean, you know, coming from, I'm not a particularly violent person, but I certainly
[03:29:16.520 --> 03:29:21.640]  am someone who believes, and part of the reason why I started writing books after I left,
[03:29:21.640 --> 03:29:28.560]  was to explain what I know of what's going on in my corner of it, and to resist to give
[03:29:28.560 --> 03:29:33.200]  information to allow people to make their own decisions and hopefully take it from there.
[03:29:33.200 --> 03:29:36.520]  Because I believe that in order to be, if we're not informed, we can't resist.
[03:29:36.520 --> 03:29:37.520]  We need to know more.
[03:29:37.520 --> 03:29:38.520]  Absolutely.
[03:29:38.520 --> 03:29:40.280]  We're going to talk more about that in the Obama deception, too.
[03:29:40.280 --> 03:29:42.040]  Nomi Prince, thank you so much for coming.
[03:29:42.040 --> 03:29:43.040]  To Austin.
