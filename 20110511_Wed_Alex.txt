[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:30.440]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:30.440 --> 00:38.880]  it is Wednesday the 11th day of May 2011 we're gonna be live here for at least the
[00:38.880 --> 00:45.040]  next three hours Vincent Boogliosi who's called for George W Bush to be charged
[00:45.040 --> 00:53.760]  with treason is gonna be joining us today and I'm gonna ask him if if Obama
[00:53.760 --> 00:58.500]  should get in trouble for his lies bringing us into new wars or is this
[00:58.500 --> 01:02.480]  just basically more partisanship I'm also gonna pick his brain the
[01:02.480 --> 01:07.640]  prosecutor that got of course one of the most famous mass murders or serial
[01:07.640 --> 01:15.680]  killers dead and that of course gentlemen needs no introduction Charlie Manson
[01:15.680 --> 01:23.920]  Boogliosi also has written a big book poo-pooing those that question the JFK
[01:23.920 --> 01:30.200]  assassination in Dealey Plaza back in 1963 we're gonna cover the waterfront with
[01:30.200 --> 01:37.640]  Mr. Boogliosi today now I have Glenn Spencer of American Patrol joining us
[01:37.640 --> 01:44.760]  I remember Spencer more than 10 years ago in the late 90s putting out videos
[01:44.760 --> 01:51.440]  predicting there would be secessionist movements of California Arizona Texas
[01:51.440 --> 01:56.920]  Nevada and that the illegals along with the help of the Fortune 100 as part of
[01:56.920 --> 02:02.240]  the North American Union would move to quote call a new state but basically it's
[02:02.240 --> 02:05.400]  an enclave of Mexico and if you look at the new announcement that's been made
[02:05.400 --> 02:10.480]  and gotten almost no media attention I mean it's in NPR AP Reuters but it's
[02:10.480 --> 02:14.720]  like oh how cute they're gonna get the votes and they're getting the petitions
[02:14.720 --> 02:21.320]  to go to the legislature and create the 51st state and break it off of course in
[02:21.320 --> 02:26.760]  Borders Mexico just like the Russians have South Ossetia in Abkhazia on their
[02:26.760 --> 02:33.640]  southern border basically taking part of Georgia oh we're going to start seeding
[02:33.640 --> 02:41.120]  land to a new little enclave that will have wide open borders just absolutely
[02:41.120 --> 02:46.040]  incredible and folks are like this will never pass well this is the beginning of
[02:46.040 --> 02:50.840]  the Balkanization of America it's a long-term strategic plan first they
[02:50.840 --> 02:53.760]  create a larger North American Union and then transfer the power to the
[02:53.760 --> 02:58.400]  multinationals but then within Canada within the US within Mexico they will
[02:58.400 --> 03:03.680]  then break certain areas off to be ethnic enclaves that are then basically
[03:03.680 --> 03:09.320]  funded and militarized by the globalist to then play different subsections of
[03:09.320 --> 03:14.440]  the larger system off against each other first they water down sovereignty by
[03:14.440 --> 03:19.160]  creating super regions then they internally break those super regions up
[03:19.160 --> 03:27.720]  into enclaves and this is just standard standard New World Order great game
[03:27.720 --> 03:33.200]  operations and if you miss those articles yesterday liberals in southern
[03:33.200 --> 03:39.400]  Arizona seek to form new state that's Reuters New York magazine Arizona
[03:39.400 --> 03:43.880]  liberals are trying to form their own tiny liberal state well it's a beach head
[03:43.880 --> 03:50.280]  for low recon quista line for Sora also Obama ready to roll out new amnesty
[03:50.280 --> 03:54.560]  carpet for illegals including this is like the Republican legalization plan
[03:54.560 --> 03:58.400]  of four years ago including felons of course you come across from Latin America
[03:58.400 --> 04:03.280]  into Mexico you get a year of hard labor in a slave camp and just search
[04:03.280 --> 04:06.880]  Mexico is the hardest on immigrants of any country in the world after North
[04:06.880 --> 04:13.760]  Korea I mean you go to a slave camp they get your family info and they call
[04:13.760 --> 04:19.200]  your family up especially in the U.S. and they say look we've run your credit we
[04:19.200 --> 04:23.040]  see you've got about 400,000 you could probably pay us do that to your husband
[04:23.040 --> 04:27.800]  son or daughter's dead they just point blank we're gonna murder your family and
[04:27.800 --> 04:33.000]  the Latin Americans they just beat them kill them torture them and it's oh so

[04:37.200 --> 04:41.760]  Texas ranchers kill pregnant Hispanic women not real and the coyotes are
[04:41.760 --> 04:45.160]  heroes of course they're every week they find new mass graves on the Texas
[04:45.160 --> 04:48.880]  border where the coyotes line up little kids women children blow their heads off
[04:48.880 --> 04:52.080]  chop their heads off because they didn't pay them the cash try to sneak across and
[04:52.080 --> 04:56.880]  you've got the Mexican mafia basically running a lot of the Hispanic media
[04:56.880 --> 05:01.280]  teaching us how cool it is to be a narco murder this is Alex Jones with five
[05:01.280 --> 05:05.520]  good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[05:05.520 --> 05:09.320]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[05:09.320 --> 05:13.400]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[05:13.400 --> 05:17.640]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the
[05:17.640 --> 05:21.920]  name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[05:21.920 --> 05:25.880]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[05:25.880 --> 05:30.040]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[05:30.040 --> 05:34.000]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[05:34.000 --> 05:38.160]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[05:38.160 --> 05:41.960]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[05:41.960 --> 05:45.440]  power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors
[05:45.440 --> 05:51.400]  you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com

[08:01.800 --> 08:07.400]  network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your
[08:07.400 --> 08:17.280]  mind
[08:17.280 --> 08:22.760]  why do we even have state governments in this country give the Democrats and
[08:22.760 --> 08:27.840]  Republican leadership have basically expanded the federal government into
[08:27.840 --> 08:32.480]  every facet of our lives violated the Bill of Rights Constitution Declaration
[08:32.480 --> 08:38.880]  of Independence prosecuted a coordinated incremental war of attrition against
[08:38.880 --> 08:44.880]  every canon of a free society why do we even have states if mr. Maddow and
[08:44.880 --> 08:50.760]  others tell us that there is Rachel Maddow tell us that there is no such thing
[08:50.760 --> 08:58.080]  as any state rights and most the time when I go on MSNBC or Phil Hartman show
[08:58.080 --> 09:04.200]  on RT or quote liberal TV or radio shows they say mr. Jones you want Texas to
[09:04.200 --> 09:08.160]  secede you want to have war with the federal government you want to bring
[09:08.160 --> 09:13.000]  back slavery you want to all this nonsensical buzzword stuff for their
[09:13.000 --> 09:20.720]  audience and I respond with I want the 10th to 9th Amendment up until 1913 the
[09:20.720 --> 09:23.920]  same year we got the income tax and the private fell reserve that we pay that
[09:23.920 --> 09:28.760]  money to before that the state legislatures that we elected I mean your
[09:28.760 --> 09:34.960]  state legislator was a basically a US senator I mean they had power because
[09:34.960 --> 09:41.600]  they would then elect the state would elect the US senator and send them to
[09:41.600 --> 09:47.320]  Washington as a minion of the states they tried to get rid of US senators
[09:47.320 --> 09:52.680]  during the Civil War the senators being elected in the states by the
[09:52.680 --> 09:58.360]  legislatures but they failed but 1913 they said look we got to get federal
[09:58.360 --> 10:02.080]  control now that we're sold out to foreign banks we've got to get these
[10:02.080 --> 10:06.120]  senators up here so we can buy them off because every time we buy them off the
[10:06.120 --> 10:10.040]  states recall them oh these state legislators could just call a vote and
[10:10.040 --> 10:19.840]  say senator Johnson senator Brown senator Wilson whatever the name was you
[10:19.840 --> 10:22.760]  didn't do what the state told you to do and you're in violation of the 9th
[10:22.760 --> 10:26.360]  to 10th Amendment you are hereby recalled and relieved we're holding a
[10:26.360 --> 10:33.880]  special election we're appointing a new US senator not anymore that's what the
[10:33.880 --> 10:37.240]  9th to 10th Amendment are about the federal government protects the border
[10:37.240 --> 10:42.560]  controls the issuance of currency and credit and has a navy to defend against
[10:42.560 --> 10:46.680]  invasion with ground troops to be trained only to be deployed via the Navy
[10:46.680 --> 10:53.480]  that's the Marine Corps now that's it an army has to then be raised for larger
[10:53.480 --> 10:56.720]  defense because they were scared of a standing army because they studied
[10:56.720 --> 11:01.080]  Europe they studied Asia they studied what had happened with the Spanish and
[11:01.080 --> 11:06.480]  French in Latin America it constantly the military leaders that Spain and
[11:06.480 --> 11:10.560]  Portugal and others had in Latin America and the Germans had the Austrian
[11:10.560 --> 11:14.640]  Hungarian Empire were constantly kicking the Empire out and declaring
[11:14.640 --> 11:19.960]  themselves supreme emperor over whatever island or country it was Mexico you
[11:19.960 --> 11:24.840]  name it and they were like we do not want standing military so these things
[11:24.840 --> 11:29.080]  take over in every case now our military industrial complex has just done it by
[11:29.080 --> 11:32.360]  getting trillions of dollars a year in tax money buying off all the
[11:32.360 --> 11:39.960]  infrastructure financing over 90% of R&D research in development and it itself
[11:39.960 --> 11:44.600]  was financed by the big offshore banks I mean we're fully totally captured by
[11:44.600 --> 11:49.320]  offshore banks America is gone it doesn't exist it was taken over a long time
[11:49.320 --> 11:53.720]  ago and I'm here to break you out of your trance if we could admit what's
[11:53.720 --> 11:58.200]  happened just like when a hijacker hijacks a plane I don't care if some
[11:58.200 --> 12:02.360]  Libyan hijacker 25 years ago dressed up in the captain outfit they did that a
[12:02.360 --> 12:08.080]  few times and then there were studies done on suddenly the the the passengers
[12:08.080 --> 12:12.560]  wouldn't resist as much after they had a chance to get into pilot uniform it was
[12:12.560 --> 12:17.000]  oh now you're wearing a pilot uniform well we just saw you hijack the plane
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.920]  with a gun and a bomb but so that's how psychology works we'll go ahead and do
[12:21.920 --> 12:28.840]  what you say you're wearing the uniform and it's the same psychological warfare
[12:28.840 --> 12:37.760]  system today in 1913 predominantly owned by the Rothschild's Rockefellers in Bank
[12:37.760 --> 12:42.040]  of England this is on record took over the issuance of currency and credit but
[12:42.040 --> 12:45.400]  one of the three things the feds are supposed to do since then under NAFTA
[12:45.400 --> 12:48.320]  and GATT we have a continental security perimeter and we're supposed to merge
[12:48.320 --> 12:53.760]  our nations that's public Bush put into place Obama publicly signed it what two
[12:53.760 --> 13:01.080]  months ago after that furor and the fight we had against it six five four
[13:01.080 --> 13:05.360]  three years ago with Bush building up to this they played possum and said you
[13:05.360 --> 13:10.200]  won we're backing off so I'm ranting about states rights right now because
[13:10.200 --> 13:16.640]  it's so important to understand that I am not a secessionist at this point the
[13:16.640 --> 13:21.640]  federal government's been seized by traders who wear our garb where our
[13:21.640 --> 13:26.160]  uniforms speak in our language just as Cicero we guys put me the Cicero quote
[13:26.160 --> 13:33.800]  about the trader is the plague just Cicero quote Rome 2046 years ago I
[13:33.800 --> 13:38.520]  believe the date of the quote was right before they killed him the trader is the
[13:38.520 --> 13:43.280]  plague and then get me that full quote but the point is the outside enemy that
[13:43.280 --> 13:46.120]  comes with their banner openly they're not the threat because you can mobilize
[13:46.120 --> 13:51.840]  against it the trader is the plague because they come from within now the
[13:51.840 --> 13:55.120]  government's been taken over the feds are trying to federalize the states so
[13:55.120 --> 13:58.040]  that we don't have the recourse to get our government our federal government
[13:58.040 --> 14:02.600]  back and down the road we may just have to go with secession because I've always
[14:02.600 --> 14:06.760]  said this for more than a decade from studying history and the globalist and
[14:06.760 --> 14:09.640]  how they operate in other nations what they're setting up here because the
[14:09.640 --> 14:15.280]  globalist create mega unions but then within that union create new boundaries
[14:15.280 --> 14:20.880]  along religious ethnic and socio-economic lines and the Romans would do
[14:20.880 --> 14:24.040]  this in regions they took over breaking them up and putting different minions
[14:24.040 --> 14:27.760]  into different areas they would get black Africans to fight with their
[14:27.760 --> 14:32.560]  neighbors just because they were a different tribe they would get gall
[14:32.560 --> 14:42.640]  France, Germania, Germany today, the Ostrogoths in Austria, the ancient Swiss
[14:42.640 --> 14:47.920]  they would literally just find out with their own anthropology and Caesar wrote
[14:47.920 --> 14:51.200]  a book on it others wrote books on it Julius Caesar did how they would play
[14:51.200 --> 14:55.320]  different people off against each other battle of all good book used to have
[14:55.320 --> 14:58.880]  people read it in high school that's when I first read it just amazing I
[14:58.880 --> 15:02.280]  learned so much just from that and since I've read more than a hundred books just
[15:02.280 --> 15:07.600]  on what the Romans did and they would go in send spies in usually to live as
[15:07.600 --> 15:13.240]  traitors for years trading amongst the groups it's like that Star Wars excuse
[15:13.240 --> 15:16.440]  me a Star Trek episode I'm not a big Star Trek fan but I did see it when I was a
[15:16.440 --> 15:21.960]  kid the old-fashioned Star Trek with Captain Kirk where they go to this
[15:21.960 --> 15:29.120]  planet and there's the two living last two living people that planet and they've
[15:29.120 --> 15:33.360]  all killed each other in wars and one side has a black face on the left and
[15:33.360 --> 15:36.640]  the other side has a black face on the right the one side of the face is white
[15:36.640 --> 15:40.480]  the other side of the face is black and one group was the elite group and the
[15:40.480 --> 15:45.200]  other group is the slave group they're identical genetically just that for that
[15:45.200 --> 15:50.120]  one little trait that the sides of the face are flipped and they had wars till
[15:50.120 --> 15:54.440]  they exterminated each other and going back to reality that's what the British
[15:54.440 --> 15:57.960]  Empire did in India that's what they did in Africa that's what the French did it's
[15:57.960 --> 16:02.720]  what the Dutch did they would go in for a few years study things look at things
[16:02.720 --> 16:07.160]  write manuals write letters back to London this is what we suggest you do
[16:07.160 --> 16:11.600]  we've been studying them for a decade this tribe hates that tribe this other
[16:11.600 --> 16:14.880]  tribe hates that tribe you use this tribe to knock out that tribe and these
[16:14.880 --> 16:17.920]  other two tribes that don't like the other tribe you move them in to destroy
[16:17.920 --> 16:21.400]  them and then they'll all be weakened and destroyed this should probably take
[16:21.400 --> 16:25.400]  one year of warfare we'll give weapons to just this one group then once they're
[16:25.400 --> 16:31.320]  done you roll in also please as quickly as you can try to send some people from
[16:31.320 --> 16:34.800]  a nearby settlement that have smallpox we want to give them some blankets to
[16:34.800 --> 16:41.040]  wipe them out that's an official British manuals used pre 1776 from the
[16:41.040 --> 16:47.160]  French and Indian War how to open the pus sores with people that had smallpox
[16:47.160 --> 16:51.680]  smear it and how to get it to the Indians within one day they found that it
[16:51.680 --> 16:55.320]  was fresher they didn't even know the science of microbes at the time but that
[16:55.320 --> 16:59.240]  as long as it was a day or so that the smallpox was still communicable I mean
[16:59.240 --> 17:05.240]  it's all been scientifically figured out hundreds of years ago and so we are
[17:05.240 --> 17:09.200]  probably going to have to move for secession just to protect the states
[17:09.200 --> 17:12.560]  see there's criminals in the federal government that are globalist who are
[17:12.560 --> 17:16.440]  already balkanizing the states to later break them up I've been saying this for
[17:16.440 --> 17:21.000]  over a decade and so the only way I'll be for secession I want to reestablish
[17:21.000 --> 17:23.960]  10th Amendment 9th Amendment get the federal government back at the place
[17:23.960 --> 17:27.160]  it's supposed to be they won't control the borders that's in the
[17:27.160 --> 17:30.080]  Constitution they won't control the currency and credit that's been given to
[17:30.080 --> 17:35.240]  foreign banks and they run all over the world in imperial operations that is
[17:35.240 --> 17:38.440]  also not what they're supposed to do in the Constitution they're supposed to
[17:38.440 --> 17:41.600]  just have a navy and defend us from invasion which again they won't do from
[17:41.600 --> 17:45.280]  the third world country to our to our south that is a failed state now the
[17:45.280 --> 17:51.880]  reason I give you some of that history and some background is here's Reuters
[17:51.880 --> 17:57.800]  liberals in southern Arizona seek to form new state New York Magazine Arizona
[17:57.800 --> 18:01.600]  liberals are trying to form their own tiny liberal state on the border as a
[18:01.600 --> 18:06.160]  beachhead to project globalist influence why does the Fortune 100 fund
[18:06.160 --> 18:13.800]  the Lorette the la reconquista la infesora reconquering invasion movement
[18:13.800 --> 18:17.760]  not that they're ever really going to be given the southwest the Mexican people
[18:17.760 --> 18:22.440]  don't run anything in Mexico they're total slaves if you dare try to illegally
[18:22.440 --> 18:27.200]  immigrate to Mexico from Latin America you're put for one year in forced labor
[18:27.200 --> 18:30.840]  if you come from a wealthy country they run your credit report and threaten to
[18:30.840 --> 18:34.200]  kill you and suck every dime out of your family I mean it's a total criminal
[18:34.200 --> 18:39.540]  state so so but the globalists understand tribalism so they come in for
[18:39.540 --> 18:43.080]  60 years the Ford Foundation pays for almost every textbook in Mexico this is
[18:43.080 --> 18:47.440]  all on record and Mexico admits they have the most draconian immigration laws
[18:47.440 --> 18:52.200]  in this hemisphere but that's all okay and reasonable because you know they
[18:52.200 --> 18:57.520]  can do no wrong Mexico is a globalist client state and they go into their the
[18:57.520 --> 19:02.280]  average education sixth grade and they teach them America belongs to you you're
[19:02.280 --> 19:06.080]  gonna get the green go plan of San Diego don't know what that is it's a plan to
[19:06.080 --> 19:11.640]  take over in a race war and kill all whites below the age of 16 I mean you
[19:11.640 --> 19:15.200]  just looking up right now University of Texas major Mexican universities you
[19:15.200 --> 19:19.440]  know to speak Spanish it's taught we will kill all whites now that's funded
[19:19.440 --> 19:23.400]  by the Rothschild Rockefeller Ford Foundation they went and well actually
[19:23.400 --> 19:30.280]  the Germans first had the plan along race lines in in in World War one if you
[19:30.280 --> 19:33.080]  want to know about the whole plan of San Diego they launched an attack in South
[19:33.080 --> 19:38.280]  Texas killed whole families wiped out a lot in that attack but then the Ford
[19:38.280 --> 19:44.920]  Foundation picked that back up and so so what they're planning to do is start
[19:44.920 --> 19:51.280]  breaking off enclaves to be basically part of Mexico already 87 miles into
[19:51.280 --> 19:54.600]  Arizona they have big signs up don't go down this road don't go on this

[22:11.120 --> 22:15.240]  United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless all
[22:15.240 --> 22:19.440]  caused by the devalued US dollar while the mainstream media continues to ignore

[23:07.440 --> 23:11.880]  Dallas was recently quoted saying this path will lead to insolvency resulting
[23:11.880 --> 23:15.760]  in the collapse of our government and our economy our country can function like

[24:14.760 --> 24:22.240]  of our guest joining us in a little over an hour with how the UN via the big
[24:22.240 --> 24:27.640]  banks is gonna break up this country now they won't succeed this first time
[24:27.640 --> 24:32.560]  they're just introducing the idea of border states all having part of the
[24:32.560 --> 24:40.480]  state broken off this case 87 miles and south and merged as a Hispanic race
[24:40.480 --> 24:44.520]  state and that's what it is and that's what's been pushed and we've done about
[24:44.520 --> 24:48.040]  it for a long time and that's why in Arizona Glenn Spencer has been raising
[24:48.040 --> 24:51.200]  the alarm for more than a decade but when they roll it out to you it's like oh a
[24:51.200 --> 24:58.160]  51st state how cute run by liberals at one open borders they're not liberals at
[24:58.160 --> 25:04.800]  all they're conquerors now the people see I don't care what color your skin is
[25:04.800 --> 25:10.800]  it's your brain and the illegal aliens I've seen the national statistics you
[25:10.800 --> 25:15.560]  can pull them up over 90% when they become citizens end up being what you
[25:15.560 --> 25:20.520]  call hardcore liberals which it's not liberal to take somebody's gun I mean
[25:20.520 --> 25:24.120]  liberal would be more freedom more guns if you use the term as Thomas Jefferson
[25:24.120 --> 25:29.040]  did but everything's turned around they vote to take my guns to take my private
[25:29.040 --> 25:33.480]  property and of course they never get any of it whether you're a socialist
[25:33.480 --> 25:38.840]  liberal white person black person Hispanic doesn't matter but they get the
[25:38.840 --> 25:43.840]  promise of that and they get a little chicken feed a little you know crumbs
[25:43.840 --> 25:49.880]  from the table they're being used as political weapons we border a narco
[25:49.880 --> 25:56.680]  terrorist state of unfathomable corruption every week I see headlines that
[25:56.680 --> 26:00.680]  are just buried in the back of the El Paso times the Austin American statesman
[26:00.680 --> 26:05.560]  about the epidemics of kidnapping going on I mean we're like Mexico City now in
[26:05.560 --> 26:09.560]  Texas and when it's the illegal alien kidnapping people it's just a little
[26:09.560 --> 26:13.680]  footnote well it's not politically correct to talk about that and political
[26:13.680 --> 26:16.880]  correctness is just the cover this is part of the breakdown of society driving
[26:16.880 --> 26:22.040]  down the wages and every week you can type it in this week in fact just type
[26:22.040 --> 26:27.440]  more mass graves found on US Mexico border we'll do it right now for you
[26:27.440 --> 26:30.600]  if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv if you're a radio listener just type
[26:30.600 --> 26:34.720]  met more mass graves found on Texas Mexico border or more mass graves
[26:34.720 --> 26:39.120]  Arizona Texas border but it's never Robert DeNiro playing the part of a
[26:39.120 --> 26:43.840]  Texan with a Texas accent an evil white guy with a with a skets and cowboy hat
[26:43.840 --> 26:48.120]  with woman going please I'm pregnant don't kill my baby and he's like I hate
[26:48.120 --> 26:53.960]  Mexicans I want to kill all your babies no no that's not who's killing the
[26:53.960 --> 26:58.120]  pregnant women it's the coyotes it's the Mexican military it's the cartels that
[26:58.120 --> 27:02.160]  work for our criminal government if they catch you not paying your $2,000
[27:02.160 --> 27:06.120]  passage they line up men women and children I saw a report a few months
[27:06.120 --> 27:09.920]  ago where there were hundreds of people in a barn men women children they cut
[27:09.920 --> 27:15.600]  their heads off let's go ahead and put that back up let's go ahead they
[27:15.600 --> 27:18.720]  actually found an article about mass graves Mexican officials recovered 96
[27:18.720 --> 27:27.160]  bodies so far in Durango that's on the border with the US there you go I mean
[27:27.160 --> 27:33.800]  it's it's a that's April 27th that's a little over a week ago but I know I saw
[27:33.800 --> 27:36.920]  in the statesman last week I mean they're just digging up bodies left and
[27:36.920 --> 27:44.040]  right but that's not an issue oh no because in reality
[27:44.840 --> 27:49.080]  Mexico's collapsing in a hellhole run by total criminals teamed up with the
[27:49.080 --> 27:56.120]  fortune 100 Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Chase that run that place and for 60 years
[27:56.120 --> 28:01.480]  the Ford Foundation has taught every Mexican school child not about liberty
[28:01.480 --> 28:08.240]  freedom the ideas of private property Second Amendment oh their disarmed they
[28:08.240 --> 28:11.640]  don't have private property their slaves I mean in Mexico if you're a little guy
[28:11.640 --> 28:15.320]  don't come from the right family you try to start a business and don't make the
[28:15.320 --> 28:18.400]  payoffs you're dead I mean I've been in southern Mexico trying to look at
[28:18.400 --> 28:22.800]  pyramids and the military just stops buses and shakes down the bus driver and
[28:22.800 --> 28:26.280]  gets a bunch of cash off of them in the Mexican troops laugh at the poor guy when
[28:26.280 --> 28:31.560]  he's got to go out and do it and see that's where America's going there it is
[28:31.560 --> 28:35.600]  25 more bodies were covered in Mexico soldiers continue to find mass graves
[28:35.600 --> 28:41.080]  Fox News soldiers are with more bodies in narco graves in northern Mexico
[28:41.080 --> 28:47.240]  Associated Press on and on but see the average Hispanic American that watches
[28:47.240 --> 28:51.360]  movie like machete all those bodies were killed by white guys in cowboy hats of
[28:51.360 --> 28:56.480]  course none of them were and there's this for many years there's this fable that
[28:56.480 --> 29:00.520]  there are men and men at the border shooting illegals as they come across and
[29:00.520 --> 29:07.480]  they actually teach people in Texas schools this is happening none of it's
[29:07.480 --> 29:12.360]  true all complete lies but see if you have a movie by Robert Rodriguez where
[29:12.360 --> 29:19.560]  the coyotes are heroes and the white guys with cowboy hats are the devil we'll
[29:19.560 --> 29:23.920]  see they think perceptions reality so it's all to vulcanize our country and
[29:23.920 --> 29:29.040]  now they're getting ready to slice off a third of Arizona including Tucson to
[29:29.040 --> 29:32.720]  just have another breach into the US and march forward and I was on man cow this
[29:32.720 --> 29:35.680]  morning and he didn't believe me about all this and then the callers were

[32:06.760 --> 32:11.080]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to
[32:11.080 --> 32:14.880]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[32:14.880 --> 32:18.520]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[32:18.520 --> 32:23.080]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[32:23.080 --> 32:27.120]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[32:27.120 --> 32:30.920]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to

[33:42.480 --> 33:48.360]  speak one for a lot that thought lives even after I'm shoveled in my grave
[33:48.360 --> 33:55.640]  delusions mr. Wordsworth delusions that you injected in your veins to make you
[33:55.640 --> 33:59.960]  think you have a strength when you have no strength at all you have nothing but
[33:59.960 --> 34:07.200]  spin me limbs of a dream and the state has no use for your time resistance to
[34:07.200 --> 34:14.080]  tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones
[34:14.080 --> 34:20.240]  all right we've got the biggest bombshell news of the total Pentagon
[34:20.240 --> 34:26.680]  cybersecurity takeover of society now being publicly announced we have a
[34:26.680 --> 34:31.800]  cornucopia of absolute documentation we're gonna be covering here in just a
[34:31.800 --> 34:37.040]  moment but I want to finish up on this whole secession issue the corporate
[34:37.040 --> 34:42.960]  media hysterically demonizes anyone that talks about states asserting their
[34:42.960 --> 34:48.880]  sovereignty and states rights and they call it secession and make bizarre
[34:48.880 --> 34:51.840]  statements about wanting to return slavery and things that have nothing to
[34:51.840 --> 34:55.760]  do with it just as buzzwords like you don't like government-run health care
[34:55.760 --> 34:58.560]  you don't like black people and you're like what does that have to do and
[34:58.560 --> 35:04.360]  they're like oh racist shut up well then you get mega corporations that fund
[35:04.360 --> 35:10.000]  Metsha La Raza all these Hispanic Ku Klux Klan groups I mean La Raza means the
[35:10.000 --> 35:17.440]  race and again I want to get along with people I like everybody okay and they
[35:17.440 --> 35:24.160]  frame all Hispanics view for them in our media that if you're Hispanic doesn't
[35:24.160 --> 35:31.960]  matter if you're from Chile Brazil Venezuela Puerto Rico doesn't matter you
[35:31.960 --> 35:36.320]  are anti-America and you're anti-American sovereignty woman ask
[35:36.320 --> 35:40.960]  those groups why is the fortune 100 you can go read who funds all those
[35:40.960 --> 35:47.180]  organizations Lulac all of it Metsha La Raza and it's JP Morgan Chase Goldman
[35:47.180 --> 35:53.920]  Sacks Bank of America Wells Fargo Miller Brewing Ford Chevy and these groups are
[35:53.920 --> 35:58.280]  all pushing the North American Union the continental security zone the deals
[35:58.280 --> 36:02.600]  were signed three years ago to quote use Canadian and Mexican troops domestically
[36:02.600 --> 36:06.880]  in each other's countries and vice versa with American troops for civil
[36:06.880 --> 36:12.320]  insurrection foreign troops and then I get up here and I say look you don't
[36:12.320 --> 36:16.880]  want to vote for people that are anti-gun if you become a citizen but see
[36:16.880 --> 36:21.680]  they teach him racial identity and then say in part of your racial identity is
[36:21.680 --> 36:26.160]  you're gonna vote to take guns you're gonna vote for socialism but then the
[36:26.160 --> 36:30.080]  socialist money is taken and given to the bankers offshore not to them and
[36:30.080 --> 36:33.720]  that's why this is such a threat and America is caught in a pincer attack
[36:33.720 --> 36:38.560]  from the poor people dependent on welfare 45 million on food stamps the
[36:38.560 --> 36:42.680]  30 million illegal aliens many of which do work hard also have government jobs
[36:42.680 --> 36:47.240]  driving down the wages a lot of the wives stay home in fact I was seeing
[36:47.240 --> 36:51.280]  statistics few years ago that on average in Los Angeles illegal aliens on
[36:51.280 --> 36:55.160]  average are on three different forms of assistance so that's how they can work
[36:55.160 --> 36:58.040]  for last because they're also getting assistance and the government knows
[36:58.040 --> 37:02.440]  they're illegal Texas gives drivers license to illegals we roll out the
[37:02.440 --> 37:05.480]  red carpet but you go to Mexico you're a piece of trash if you're a foreigner
[37:05.480 --> 37:12.840]  whether you're from Guatemala or Canada now here's the key to this when you look
[37:12.840 --> 37:19.080]  at it I got a guy works my office is an awesome job he is here legally he's
[37:19.080 --> 37:23.400]  Venice Wayland and he'd like to become a US citizen he's going through the whole
[37:23.400 --> 37:30.240]  process properly great guy super smart and he hates communist because he grew
[37:30.240 --> 37:33.840]  up under and when we get to the whole story because his family still lives
[37:33.840 --> 37:37.720]  there and they can recriminate against him but his family has he's told me I
[37:37.720 --> 37:41.240]  could tell this much his family has a private school a small private school
[37:41.240 --> 37:45.560]  and the Chavez people come in and they say and I looked it up that it was
[37:45.560 --> 37:49.200]  actually true it there's news reports and they say you're gonna give the kids
[37:49.200 --> 37:52.560]  government assistance food in the morning and the government delivers milk
[37:52.560 --> 37:56.160]  every morning and you're gonna have the small children close their eyes and
[37:56.160 --> 38:00.960]  then pray to Hugo Chavez and then when they open their eyes the the carton of
[38:00.960 --> 38:06.600]  milk is in front of them and and I mean that's communist run schools and he
[38:06.600 --> 38:10.720]  says the Chavez people only hire their buddies they beat up whoever they want
[38:10.720 --> 38:18.000]  they run the media it's hellish and he hates Hugo Chavez now and I didn't want
[38:18.000 --> 38:20.880]  me to say his first name because his family still lives down there and they
[38:20.880 --> 38:26.480]  will kill you they will the government will kill you if you criticize them now
[38:26.480 --> 38:31.680]  is that freedom and he's not a conservative he's not a liberal he is
[38:31.680 --> 38:36.320]  somebody who wants freedom okay so I wouldn't care if he had blue skin he's a
[38:36.320 --> 38:42.000]  great guy smart guy charming guy gets the job done great guy I'd say what over a
[38:42.000 --> 38:46.760]  third of my employees are Hispanic but but then our media says that they've
[38:46.760 --> 38:51.960]  got to adopt the Mexican culture for all of the dozens of Hispanic cultures
[38:51.960 --> 38:56.760]  they've got to adopt that narco terrorist corrupt disarmed population
[38:56.760 --> 39:01.240]  enslaved by the Aztecs and enslaved by the Spanish then enslaved by the French
[39:01.240 --> 39:06.280]  and enslaved by the Austrian Hungarian Empire never having any freedom totally
[39:06.280 --> 39:10.520]  shoved around and controlled and and we're taught in school I was taught I
[39:10.520 --> 39:14.920]  was you know doing good in my art class here in Austin then I'm getting to the
[39:14.920 --> 39:22.360]  big news folks the big news is coming up the huge news and I was getting eight
[39:22.360 --> 39:27.280]  pluses and all this and the teacher said I want to choose you you know because
[39:27.280 --> 39:31.480]  I'm taking one person from each class to a special workshop at the University of
[39:31.480 --> 39:37.760]  Texas would you like to go Alex it's a field trip and I said sure I mean I was
[39:37.760 --> 39:43.720]  a senior I had basically all my courses done I said sure I'll go to UT and I
[39:43.720 --> 39:47.560]  was brought into UT the Art Center and they had a Hispanic guy come in and say
[39:47.560 --> 39:52.040]  Whites are evil America's evil areca keys so we're taking America down and
[39:52.040 --> 39:57.000]  and and then it was all great rapture and I started questioning him and I said I
[39:57.000 --> 40:01.780]  said well Mexico has really serious abuse against other Latin Americans of
[40:01.780 --> 40:07.960]  Mexico has never been free and I said and and and it was there was a big
[40:07.960 --> 40:11.340]  meeting with the teacher and him and they were asking how does he know this
[40:11.340 --> 40:15.880]  it was it was very frightening I've read a few history books but but this is
[40:15.880 --> 40:20.600]  the indoctrination because they don't want Hispanics assimilating and getting
[40:20.600 --> 40:24.600]  into guns and private property and freedom because it fits perfectly with
[40:24.600 --> 40:27.640]  what they want they already hate the fact that Hispanics on average are very
[40:27.640 --> 40:31.920]  family oriented I've seen the statistics Hispanics on average will run from the
[40:31.920 --> 40:36.480]  CPS they'll fight back so CPS doesn't hunt them as much like to do blacks and
[40:36.480 --> 40:42.640]  whites who are subservient on average so they really need to brand all Hispanic
[40:42.640 --> 40:46.800]  culture not even the Mexican culture but to the corrupt ruling class culture
[40:46.800 --> 40:51.520]  these to Hano singers these Mexican rap singers it's all how cool the gangs are
[40:51.520 --> 40:55.400]  how cool the murder is just like what they sell the blacks to get them into
[40:55.400 --> 40:59.920]  that culture and the whites and they build it up and they're heroes and
[40:59.920 --> 41:04.320]  Robert Rodriguez's film and and then this is what's offered as the culture
[41:04.320 --> 41:09.160]  and so all Hispanics are told you will adopt a la reconquista and that's what
[41:09.160 --> 41:13.160]  Robert Rodriguez imported to all Spanish speaking countries in this
[41:13.160 --> 41:18.120]  hemisphere was machetes and the word the revolution has begun in Spanish and
[41:18.120 --> 41:23.040]  we showed that on air and it was billed and sold in Spanish it's time for the
[41:23.040 --> 41:27.360]  gringo to get it now we're taking them down and of course in all of Latin
[41:27.360 --> 41:31.440]  America the machete because they're disarmed as slaves is the sign of peasant
[41:31.440 --> 41:36.400]  uprising don't rebel against the corrupt Latin American CIA run governments
[41:36.400 --> 41:40.840]  rebel against the stupid gringo because they didn't even say that in the movie
[41:40.840 --> 41:45.120]  gringos line up Hispanic women and shoot them in the stomach get the gringo
[41:45.120 --> 41:50.000]  get them get them get them and I'm supposed to go oh what a wonderful
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.560]  sigh up oh oh now we can break off pieces of the southern states and then be
[41:54.560 --> 41:59.040]  Mexican enclaves exactly what the globalists want because they just want
[41:59.040 --> 42:03.480]  us all poor fighting with each other and then being enslaved to them
[42:03.480 --> 42:08.200]  financially being controlled and then the white people and Hispanic black
[42:08.200 --> 42:11.280]  middle class folks that are scared with the riots and the control that's
[42:11.280 --> 42:15.440]  coming will beg for the police state and the system to protect them and the
[42:15.440 --> 42:21.600]  globalists will come in and then route the the Mexican uprising now I told you
[42:21.600 --> 42:25.720]  there'd be moves to break off parts of southern states southwestern states now
[42:25.720 --> 42:33.320]  in the news today you have been warned and you know it's really genius because
[42:33.320 --> 42:37.840]  we're all tribal at a base level we all tend to be racially you know conscious
[42:37.840 --> 42:44.120]  just because the studies show black people on average in the preferring
[42:44.120 --> 42:47.320]  black folks because it's what their mommy and their daddy look like it's what
[42:47.320 --> 42:51.800]  they're used to white people Hispanics and if I see a Hispanic guy with a
[42:51.800 --> 42:55.880]  Hispanic woman I don't know you're a racist you're you're with a Hispanic I
[42:55.880 --> 43:01.000]  mean that's on average that's that's what people are attracted to you know it's
[43:01.000 --> 43:08.600]  it's it is pure mind control that's going on so they don't want people
[43:08.600 --> 43:14.240]  assimilating getting along they want to break this country up and I can't even
[43:14.240 --> 43:19.360]  watch UFC fights because every you know fighter who's Latino from the US has to
[43:19.360 --> 43:23.600]  dance around with a Mexican flag and you know make comments against the US and
[43:23.600 --> 43:28.600]  have larica and quista tattoos on them and you know you you turn on comedy
[43:28.600 --> 43:33.360]  central and the Hispanic comedians are badmouther than white people I mean I'm
[43:33.360 --> 43:38.760]  tired of it see see I want you to have a second amendment I want you to have
[43:38.760 --> 43:45.200]  private property rights I want you to have dignity and not be a slave and what
[43:45.200 --> 43:49.640]  the big corporations have programmed Hispanics to do they're trying to program
[43:49.640 --> 43:56.880]  them all is to be part of this and to associate their racial identity with
[43:56.880 --> 44:02.680]  anti-white and anti-gun and anti-freedom and and and I'm just not
[44:02.680 --> 44:07.080]  going to put up with it okay and this is a strategic program to break up this
[44:07.080 --> 44:12.680]  country now coming up at 45 minutes Clint Spencer joins us who predicted all
[44:12.680 --> 44:16.160]  this we're going to be talking to him about it you just joined us they're
[44:16.160 --> 44:20.120]  moving to break Arizona in two and I've looked at what the groups are calling for
[44:20.120 --> 44:22.640]  it's basically a pro open border that's what they said they're doing it for
[44:22.640 --> 44:30.800]  enclave and also a taxing base to create a new Mexican driven racial
[44:30.800 --> 44:36.240]  enclave the whites are invited to stay now as part of the plan of San Diego if
[44:36.240 --> 44:44.360]  they submit and serve the greater lie in Fasora and that's the plan I mean folks
[44:44.360 --> 44:50.000]  the average white person is an arrested development over the hill that's not a
[44:50.000 --> 44:53.240]  bad thing it's just a fact aging population who wants to watch football
[44:53.240 --> 44:57.080]  and is so guilt-stricken they bow down and worship anybody that even has a
[44:57.080 --> 45:01.360]  suntan okay you know I didn't even this morning when I get on air and say I love
[45:01.360 --> 45:05.600]  Hispanic people I a lot of folks that work with me are I don't even prove
[45:05.600 --> 45:10.640]  myself I don't care okay you know all your liberal fundraisers where are the
[45:10.640 --> 45:15.760]  Hispanic groups about the push to get Hispanics to abort their babies see you
[45:15.760 --> 45:21.320]  know no no no you ignore all that see I want you to have your babies I like life
[45:21.320 --> 45:25.040]  but see you want to kill your babies but that's okay because it's liberal
[45:25.040 --> 45:29.880]  murdering the little brown babies is good and liberal it's see how this all
[45:29.880 --> 45:35.040]  works so I've had enough I've had enough of it and if you want to play along with
[45:35.040 --> 45:40.960]  this whole plan fine the issue is I'm not running and I'm aware of what's
[45:40.960 --> 45:45.480]  going on and I'm gonna I'm gonna try to mobilize as many people as I can they
[45:45.480 --> 45:48.960]  will not teach in Texas schools that over a third of the people that were
[45:48.960 --> 45:52.680]  involved in setting up Texas were Hispanic they will not talk about the
[45:52.680 --> 45:55.880]  father of the Texas Constitution who wrote the Constitution being Hispanic
[45:55.880 --> 46:00.720]  they will not tell anybody the truth that's why they put out these movies and
[46:00.720 --> 46:05.120]  demonize the Alamo I mean how do you demonize guys fighting you know out
[46:05.120 --> 46:13.400]  number 10 to 1 well see they hate that too and and and the truth is Mexico has
[46:13.400 --> 46:18.880]  a hellish history but so does every other country out there America isn't
[46:18.880 --> 46:23.360]  perfect the point is we don't want to emulate this and use this as our
[46:23.360 --> 46:27.480]  template and have the culture and the comedians and the rappers and the
[46:27.480 --> 46:32.000]  Tejano people a force feed this down your children's throat to the point of
[46:32.000 --> 46:37.080]  in Texas in California and Arizona and Nevada there have been multiple news
[46:37.080 --> 46:41.560]  articles per state where the school teachers tell in many of the cases
[46:41.560 --> 46:47.080]  Hispanic kids you do not wear an American flag old Navy shirt and they're
[46:47.080 --> 46:50.880]  like well this is just a shirt my mom bought me that's offensive and in the
[46:50.880 --> 46:54.840]  schools where the illegal aliens of the majority the American flag is not allowed
[46:54.840 --> 46:58.880]  they take it down off the post offices everywhere and you've you've seen the
[46:58.880 --> 47:06.680]  it on video and this is these are kids so hateful of the American flag and when
[47:06.680 --> 47:12.200]  it symbolizes brought up and taught this in the public schools not in Mexico
[47:12.200 --> 47:16.760]  that's happening too but here in the US that they can't even see an American
[47:16.760 --> 47:28.160]  flag I have had on time at a steakhouse a Hispanic waiter asked me what my
[47:28.160 --> 47:32.320]  American flag shirt meant I had another guy asked what my 1776 meant I've had
[47:32.320 --> 47:38.320]  people freak out when I'm wearing the minute man you know from 1776 cold
[47:38.320 --> 47:43.840]  pepper snake and I hear the lady talking in English I go to the counter to buy
[47:43.840 --> 47:47.880]  coffee and be gas and she starts speaking in Spanish and in San Juan
[47:47.880 --> 47:52.720]  infesora stuff so scared that she's seeing that snake which is just one of
[47:52.720 --> 47:56.240]  the flags of some Marine Corps flag one of their flags has nothing to do with
[47:56.240 --> 48:00.400]  but she's been taught that flag means shooting pregnant Hispanic women in the
[48:00.400 --> 48:04.760]  stomach folks it's not people wearing minute man shirts that are shooting
[48:04.760 --> 48:10.720]  Hispanic women in the stomach okay it's not real it's not happening it's not
[48:10.720 --> 48:17.800]  going on it's your own corrupt murderous government that's doing that again and
[48:17.800 --> 48:22.560]  the globalist have masterplanned how to control this country how to take it down
[48:22.560 --> 48:26.160]  now I've already spent 48 minutes on this and I haven't even gotten to the
[48:26.160 --> 48:30.400]  other news and I'm completely blown away by the magnitude of it I knew it was
[48:30.400 --> 48:34.240]  all coming but to see it actually rolled out signifies to get ready for the
[48:34.240 --> 48:37.960]  stage terror see I just tell it like it is people say are you liberal or you
[48:37.960 --> 48:41.320]  conservative are you libertarian are you what are you I'm somebody who studies

[54:19.000 --> 54:23.520]  resistance you know about California five years ago trying to put in smart
[54:23.520 --> 54:27.920]  meters that control your thermostat in your house first they said don't worry
[54:27.920 --> 54:31.880]  we can control it but we won't now they're going ahead with it saying they
[54:31.880 --> 54:35.720]  are gonna control your thermostat Texas knew they would get resistance so they
[54:35.720 --> 54:39.800]  didn't even debate it they just came and put them in to everybody's houses they
[54:39.800 --> 54:43.960]  put them in last year year on the side of our building out here now they're
[54:43.960 --> 54:47.720]  announcing they're gonna control it I saw articles two years ago about old
[54:47.720 --> 54:52.360]  people on assistance in different cities being invited into these new
[54:52.360 --> 54:56.800]  communities where their refrigerators tracked or toilets tracked it's all
[54:56.800 --> 55:01.360]  hooked into wireless systems for their safety to monitor them to make sure
[55:01.360 --> 55:05.560]  they're eating enough to make sure they're doing well it's like pre nursing
[55:05.560 --> 55:11.280]  home at Google is in there MIT Defense Department everything is going to be
[55:11.280 --> 55:17.200]  tracked and controlled now going back to the telecommunications act and similar
[55:17.200 --> 55:22.880]  acts since then they have standardized washing machines refrigerators
[55:22.880 --> 55:27.080]  everything's coming out you've got to pay for it the ticket price under
[55:27.080 --> 55:32.560]  regulations by the government versus at the precedent on light bulbs toilets
[55:32.560 --> 55:38.800]  things like that where all devices have wireless chips now you've heard iPhone
[55:38.800 --> 55:43.160]  5's coming out all the new cell phones coming out not just Apple will now have
[55:43.160 --> 55:47.560]  the RFID chip embedded you cannot remove the battery from all the new phones
[55:47.560 --> 55:54.160]  that are coming out this is all federal regulations not law they have tracker
[55:54.160 --> 55:59.520]  chips that GPS triangulate you all phones bylaw 96 had to be in place
[55:59.520 --> 56:04.920]  October 1st 2001 we told you months ago first it was Apple then droid with
[56:04.920 --> 56:12.160]  Google then AT&T phones then the Microsoft phones it's all phones they
[56:12.160 --> 56:17.440]  were ordered to do it but they're happy to so globally it's global standardization
[56:17.440 --> 56:22.680]  from Japan to the US every country with with a unified system we're already
[56:22.680 --> 56:26.240]  under global government it's done via regulation and corporate agreements the
[56:26.240 --> 56:29.160]  corporations have set up the world government so of course they follow the
[56:29.160 --> 56:37.360]  orders they don't bucket to where all devices track you all devices track
[56:37.360 --> 56:41.520]  what's in your refrigerator what you're doing all laptops watch you that have
[56:41.520 --> 56:46.360]  cameras all phones watch you they're now coming out with smartphones that have
[56:46.360 --> 56:50.400]  the camera behind the glass so that you can't cover it up if you're gonna see
[56:50.400 --> 56:56.440]  your screen they admit now on stars listening to you tracking you now if
[56:56.440 --> 56:59.320]  you're doubting me here are just the headlines today I'm getting chills
[56:59.320 --> 57:05.440]  Google wants to control your home CNN headline and it says Google is coming
[57:05.440 --> 57:10.280]  out with interfaces that wire into all new appliances but wait a minute why did
[57:10.280 --> 57:14.040]  the government a decade ago or more depending on which regulation put in
[57:14.040 --> 57:20.480]  policies where everything coming out was universally compatible for this see
[57:20.480 --> 57:25.600]  it's all been pre-planned everybody's now saying oh Obama just had the plan to
[57:25.600 --> 57:29.280]  have presidential alerts to your phone and break in and take it over even if
[57:29.280 --> 57:35.160]  you don't want it to that's the telecommunications act of 96 I cover
[57:35.160 --> 57:40.960]  all that in police state 2019 99 how much have I yelled and screamed this
[57:40.960 --> 57:45.040]  year there's nothing more frustrating than knowing we have a diabolical
[57:45.040 --> 57:51.720]  scientific dictatorship here's another example it'll be 40 years next month in
[57:51.720 --> 57:56.440]  a global secret agreement that all babies at birth have their blood taken
[57:56.440 --> 58:00.880]  and put in a global DNA database to develop race specific bio weapons is
[58:00.880 --> 58:05.680]  one of the reasons and a global DNA database so they can frame you that's
[58:05.680 --> 58:10.400]  we've been under global government for a long time they're just now mopping up
[58:10.400 --> 58:15.200]  the final holdouts Iran Libya Indonesia doesn't even mean those countries are
[58:15.200 --> 58:22.880]  good most governments are corrupt Pakistan it's on now we've actually got
[58:22.880 --> 58:29.560]  another guest coming up I don't know how I'm gonna cover all this they are now

[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:38.680]  Alex Jones
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:44.080]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen it is our number two if you just joined us
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:49.920]  cyber warfare rules included in defense bill the cyber security act they've
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:53.160]  now added to the defense bill they've tried to pass for about four years or
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:59.440]  so or more says all infrastructure government Pentagon hubs the Pentagon
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:04.480]  will openly attack alternative media websites in the US all radio TV all
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:09.960]  cell phones all devices the wireless networks the smart meters all
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:14.520]  government Pentagon run with the Pentagon domestically the four branches of the
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:18.440]  military running things we're gonna be breaking all of that down and how it
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:24.000]  dovetails with Google wants to control your home CNN the big article by Paul
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.440]  Joseph Watson's that is so key for everyone to understand the full spectrum
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:34.480]  of what's happening federal spy ships the hijack your phone the announcement
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:37.520]  that Americans are set to be bombarded with a mandatory government
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:41.600]  propaganda the other cell phones represents a shocking lurch forward in
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:45.400]  the Obama administration's bid to launch a total takeover of all communications
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:48.360]  as part of a wider move towards controlling the internet developing an
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:52.760]  omnipresent wiretap system and creating a constant environment of suspicion and
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:57.040]  distrust in listing citizens to spy on each other so it's a dual kill switch
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:01.240]  where they can individually kill devices that's admitted today all over the news
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:04.920]  oh it's a chip in the phone that can kill it that can listen to you that can
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:12.040]  cut your calls and force video or text up there and they already got the basic
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:16.080]  takeover chips in there but now they're saying we want a total takeover chip and
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:18.840]  it's going in next year and of course they've already been manufactured and
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:24.600]  they're ready and it was all time for the bin Laden rollout just like in 96 they
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:27.560]  pass the telecommunications that all phones will be tracked in real time and
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:31.800]  listen to you without warrants they had to be in place with all manufacturers by
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:38.480]  October 1st 2001 one month after 9-11 so that everybody would go along with it
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:43.680]  it's all been scripted there's a master plan it's all been laid out it's so
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:48.240]  childlike that I get emails saying you mean Obama's continuing what Bush did
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:51.800]  yeah the war is the torture the Guantanamo the secret arrest the lobbyist
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:56.160]  the banker bailouts it's bipartisan of course at that level they're doing what
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:01.200]  the ruling class and the elite and the corporations one of course Bush saved the
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:06.200]  fake bin Laden capture and kill for Obama I mean those guys are all in the
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:10.840]  same team grow up and get it the elite decide who they want as president they
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:14.960]  get behind them they give them the money they promote them they put a ringer in
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:25.720]  like Bob Dole in 96 or another corpse McCain in 2008 vice versa they run a the
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:32.960]  cousin of Bush is sculling bones you know fraternity buddy Carrie against him
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:39.560]  Bush clearly steals the election and Carrie doesn't contest it even though he
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:42.880]  had total proof letter folks went to prison for it it's not that Carrie was
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:47.960]  good it's not that McCain was good it's that their time was up it's a Don King
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:51.760]  fight people like well how does Don King rig a fight he tells one of the guys
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:56.280]  you're getting paid $500,000 and I'm gonna give you future fights and you go
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:00.880]  down in the fourth at the end of the fourth you know he's got big money on
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:05.560]  that do you understand and the fighter knows when to go down at the end of the
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:10.000]  fourth I mean this is not rocket science ladies and gentlemen
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.520]  hypothetically that's just a joke we all know Don King doesn't fix fights and
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:19.060]  we all know that private Lynch really that was all real and Pat Tillman was
[01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:22.640]  killed fighting al-Qaeda and the Easter Bunny you know has 14-inch fangs who
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:26.760]  wants to drink your blood I mean it's all made up okay vampires aren't real
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:31.120]  goblins aren't real and there's been a lot in thing in real Santa Claus in real
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:35.160]  bottom line now I've been authorized now to talk about this I knew about it
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:39.440]  yesterday we are changed Colorado contacted us and got us in touch with
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:42.960]  their lawyer it turns out we've interviewed before a great guy and we're

[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:55.880]  will say turn that off but they're all videotaping you they want to cover up the
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:12:01.120]  crime remember last year in October or November we would report and listeners
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:04.800]  would confirm the hands down the pants they were still saying we don't even
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:08.560]  grope you on the outside it's not groping it's security it's professionalism and

[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:19.760]  witnessed it happen to the governor this is what's going on so see they don't
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:23.560]  want you to have a public debate about this they're training their armies their
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:27.560]  cadres to later roll it out kind of like for over a decade they've been
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:31.880]  listening to your cell phone without warrants now they're announcing it they've
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:35.800]  been with the smart meters able to control your thermostat now they're

[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:43.680]  major public school that we've looked at for over a decade Austin had face
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:50.400]  scanning and microphones up in 1998 I got the federal grant documents from K
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:55.400]  Bailey Hutchinson on it that's in my film police state 2000 now they
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:59.960]  announced it last month now they're announcing it to the slaves Gary good
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:05.120]  to have you on with us today a great patriot standing up you've got a history
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:10.080]  of beating these guys what really happened with the evil we are change
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:13.880]  people trying to show the out of control 10th amendment out of their
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:18.800]  jurisdiction toilet attendant level goons who love to grow up small children
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:23.240]  what happened well Alex let me first say thank you for having me on your show
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:27.520]  it's always a pleasure although this isn't as pleasurable as it has been in
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:31.000]  the past because these four young people have been charged with criminal
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.720]  offenses and that's really the travesty there was one of the younger members of
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:39.720]  you know she's in there in her 20s and and of course she's attractive she's a
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:44.960]  newer member to Colorado we are change I had met her a couple of weeks ago at
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:49.920]  one of the functions and she was actually flying to California for business
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:54.720]  and although this wasn't an official expansion event through Colorado we are
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:58.880]  change or I would have gotten the email but nonetheless some of the members
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:04.000]  that were seasoned simply wanted to ask her escort her to her flight now of
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.200]  course we've all been trained that you can't go beyond security without a
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:11.480]  boarding pass and although Katie had a boarding pass the other three gentlemen
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:15.480]  did not so they were attempting to you know to make their point that hey
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:19.440]  listen we're here we're just her friends we want to make sure that she gets on
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:23.480]  this plane we understand that's the point they didn't hide it they showed up to
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:26.920]  show the good-looking woman who we know that the pedophiles and the pervs are
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:30.280]  going to target that's their favorite and and we know they're gonna attack
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:34.400]  that's why they've got the job they like to you know grab women's breast and so
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:38.640]  they were there to protect her and this is the TSA striking back you do not
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:42.600]  refuse the search or they'll try to charge you now and you don't videotape
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:46.920]  the groping you sit there and you take it you take the Soviet reeducation camp
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:51.120]  you you take the rape you take it you take the sexual assault you take it you
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:56.040]  like it and you don't show it or you go to jail well plus we've all heard in the
[01:14:56.040 --> 01:15:00.600]  national media that even if you get through the security checkpoint that
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:04.080]  doesn't mean that once you get into the concourse that they're not going to
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:09.640]  pick you out again and there you are now by yourself and maybe you're not in your
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:13.440]  mid-20s maybe you're in your mid-70s you know maybe you're in your mid-teens you
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:16.800]  know but we can't have parents go beyond the checkpoint we can't have
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:19.600]  relatives go beyond the checkpoint we can't have friends go beyond the
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:25.560]  checkpoint and so their purpose was to get past the checkpoint submit ID you
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:29.880]  know and get on to the little train we have to the concourse stay with her
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:33.520]  until she's safely got on her plane which I just don't think is that
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:37.080]  extraordinary I think that that's pretty normal but we want to make sure that
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:40.760]  our friends and relatives are taken care of and you know they've been charged in
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:45.800]  the local municipal court with disturbing the peace interference with
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:49.920]  police trespass but you know nonetheless their criminal charges I
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:54.920]  appeared with one of the young men this morning in in court after he had spent
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:16:02.000]  35 hours in jail over his trespass disturbing the peace ticket but they
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.480]  could have simply been issued now they could have gotten summons to appear but
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:09.640]  you know they had to be arrested Katie mr. flight thank goodness you made it up
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:14.200]  later and then was able to make her appointment but in the end I think what
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:20.440]  started out as being a genuine concern for a friend just turned into a mountain
[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:25.760]  of problems and that's their whole they know is to make it so uncomfortable to
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:30.280]  stand up for your rights but if you do you may just wind up on the evening news
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:35.840]  and channel seven you're locally posted a picture of Osama bin Laden next to
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:40.440]  their four mug shots really that's what the local mute and they showed the four
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:45.480]  mug shots and then the next picture up on the screen was Osama bin Laden so
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:49.960]  these young men and women for we are changed who are protecting our rights
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:55.760]  protecting the Constitution doing the dirty work for all us lazy people are
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:17:00.800]  compared with Osama bin Laden by the way I've been harassed once I've gone
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:04.680]  through the gate and I've also seen them harassing their favorites old ladies
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:08.240]  and wheelchairs are old men for some reason swiping them harassing them at
[01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:13.400]  the gate I've seen foreigners in weird uniforms called Wolverine security in
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:17.480]  San Francisco years ago gibbering and jabbering at people and poking at them
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:22.240]  and absolutely I mean I remember the good old days at going and meeting you
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:26.480]  know girlfriends and people at the gate you don't do that in America anymore and
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:30.280]  now they're expanding it to the bus terminals the train stations they're
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:34.640]  now announcing what they've already been beta testing the full rollout of hands
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:38.080]  down the pants that happened in Miami a few months ago where now you take
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:42.320]  somebody to the Greyhound station and they run in and stick their hands down
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:47.240]  your pants so they're turning everything basically into a prison and I don't think
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:51.680]  that we can deny that they're singling out you know you know particular
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:55.480]  individual which don't necessarily look like terrorists but more commonly look
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:18:00.240]  like a track of young women so I think that was a part of it and I think that
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:04.080]  there's been national coverage on this mainstream coverage I just saw a video a
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:10.760]  couple of days ago of a baby being felt all over and someone was videotaping
[01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:15.040]  that so if we're not happy and at least trying some confrontation and I must
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:19.280]  say Alex although I'm on a public airway there was an element of civil
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:23.720]  disobedience here I mean I understand that but on the other hand laws were
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:28.160]  broken well here's who's breaking the law the federal government is violating
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:32.520]  the Bill of Rights Constitution wholesale they're surveilling everybody
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:36.480]  they're helping get me tolub on the airplane US government admits they did
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:41.040]  State Department admits it under orders I mean they're running the terror attacks
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:44.400]  I mean I mean let's get down to the bottom line here the government are the
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:47.360]  terrorists they're the narcotics traffickers they're the ones that are
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:51.120]  staging all this to turn us into a prison state so they can steal everything
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:54.720]  and then use the police state to suppress us so it's very simple their
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:59.480]  terrorist end of story well you know these matters hopefully can be resolved
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:05.640]  sort of trial but I don't see you know my clients pleading guilty anytime soon
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:10.640]  so hopefully although you know for example I'm in the middle of picking a
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:14.680]  jury right now and I must thank the judge for allowing me to have a 25 minute
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:19.680]  break to be able to talk to you but in the end I just hope that if this matter
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:22.880]  goes to that far and I can't imagine that it's going to but it just might
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:29.320]  but the jurors hopefully understand that their job is now to stand up for these
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:35.680]  you know young men and women who at that time and throughout their their
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:40.240]  careers have stood up for their right to absolutely Gary Gary we've all got to

[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:26.800]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation

[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:13.280]  and you have these mega corporations the fortune 100
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:18.880]  on record advising government from clinton bush
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:23.760]  obama right through to today in every case
[01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:27.360]  lobbying to have these control grids put in in the name of security
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:30.720]  while meanwhile pushing to never build any of the border fence
[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:34.880]  to never put in the smart fence to stall
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:38.240]  now bush started it obama completed it a month ago
[01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:41.520]  shining the north american security perimeter there won't be security on the
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:46.640]  canadian or mexico border there will only be security
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:51.200]  from alaska down to the southern mexico's border with guatemala
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:55.520]  and the ottawa citizen reported deals have now been signed
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:58.160]  we'll even put that on screen folks won't believe that
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:02.400]  to use mexican and canadian troops inside the united states and vice versa
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:06.160]  to quote fight civil insurrection
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:10.080]  now when you study these globalists in syria
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:15.600]  in libya right now wherever they go in africa in latin america
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:20.400]  in asia they always go in and create new super zones
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:24.960]  to supersede the original sovereignty of the original state
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:29.040]  but then within those states along ethnic and religious lines
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:33.120]  racial lines they send in the anthropologists that understand how to
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:36.320]  balkanize the british wrote manuals on this 300 years ago
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:40.160]  julius caesar wrote the battle for gall over 2 000 years ago and broke down how
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:43.680]  they did this with groups who weren't racially
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:47.440]  different but were tribally different you know had grudges
[01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:51.520]  and so for 60 years the ford foundation has publicly paid for textbooks
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:54.480]  just like they were caught paying for textbooks going back 50 years ago in the
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:58.160]  muslim countries saying jihad destroy america that came out in the
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:03.200]  washington post nine years ago to radicalize the muslim so we don't
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:06.000]  get along so there's been a pretext to go invade those countries
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:09.920]  same thing here they go into mexico we've covered the textbooks we've shown
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:13.440]  them here on air saying the southwest belongs to mexico racial
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:16.240]  oslan our former mayor gus garcia there's video
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:20.000]  declared it race day for hispanics and so they are the supreme race
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.680]  i'm a guy that cut my teeth protest in the klan i don't like to clan i don't
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:27.280]  like mecha lo raza means the race but the thing is the klan
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:30.640]  maybe a hundred thousand people that literally can't get up off the couch
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:33.920]  drinking whiskey from what i've researched and looked at
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:36.800]  led by some feds and things they've been caught doing that howl turner and
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:39.440]  others uh you know leading some of the white
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:42.560]  supremacist groups it constantly comes out well it's the same thing here but
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:45.440]  you got the ford foundation funding this and teaching it
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:48.960]  and i was on a man cows show today and he had a
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:52.320]  mexican model on as he was talking about viva mexico i wrapped myself the
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:56.320]  mexican flag and i said hey you you know if mexico's so great a failed
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:59.760]  narco terra estate why do you want to make it like that here
[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:03.360]  and then callers were calling in going yeah we are taking over america
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:07.200]  now the media is trying to brand it that if you're a porto rican brazilian
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:09.920]  venezuelan you're supposed to take on mexican culture
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:14.480]  which isn't even the official culture at all this la rica and quista idea this
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:18.880]  liberation theology financed by the big tax-free foundations carnegie you name
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:21.360]  it we're going to glenn spencer here in just a moment
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:24.720]  but i want to set the table with this
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:27.520]  now the plan is just to get us to each other's throats
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:32.080]  i wouldn't even really be against immigration at the record levels if
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:35.440]  they were taught the second amendment liberty freedom property rights
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:40.080]  anti-globalist pro america uh and then if they weren't given welfare which then
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:43.120]  bankrupts the country but that's not what's happening over 90 percent of
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:45.840]  these illegals when they become citizens or vote illegally
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:49.520]  vote to take the guns for socialism because
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:53.840]  because the the the liberal groups that sell them the racial ideology that's
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:58.080]  so attractive to any you know human it's it's ingrained into everybody
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:01.840]  they piggyback the socialism the gun control the slavery
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:05.840]  and so that's why there's a ticking time bomb it we've almost lost
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:09.920]  whether you're black white hispanic it's almost over and we'll fall like mexico
[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:12.800]  a tiny elite it's exactly what jp morgan
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:17.680]  goldman sacks uh one on record they're the biggest financers of this
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:21.600]  they want you poor so there won't be any oslan i mean there'll be folks running
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:24.880]  around saying it is it'll be new world order on
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:30.640]  but glenn spencer i remember in conquest of oslan is other films 10 11 12 13
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:33.840]  years ago i remember glenn spencer who worked
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:37.280]  with native american groups helping them who was a humanitarian guy
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:41.680]  in mexico seeing this la raza la infosora movement
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:45.600]  and i remember seeing glenn and you can look at his films online or get them on
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:48.560]  dvd from him where he laid out on this show
[01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:51.920]  in the dvds on his websites american patrol dot com
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:57.280]  and other sites they have that this was going to happen now the democrats and
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:00.160]  it's it's racially motivated i've had some of these uh
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:03.920]  state reps on and congress people from arizona they'll say yeah it's part of
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:06.880]  la raza it's part of the race yeah we're taking over
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:10.720]  based in tucson they have a city council that admits that it's racially based
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:14.560]  you know they pull down american flags at the post office kids can't wear american
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:18.960]  flags at school for 87 miles into arizona they have signs
[01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:21.280]  up saying don't go into these areas if you're an american
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:25.360]  this is basically now mexico uh even hispanic kids not allowed to wear american
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:29.280]  flags same thing in san francisco i mean it's a war
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:32.480]  and and and and they've been taught no matter how horrible mexico is and all
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:35.680]  the mass graves and the coyotes killing people
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:39.600]  it doesn't matter rodriguez makes movies about where the
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:43.760]  ranchers are killing hispanic pregnant women instead of the truth of the coyotes
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:47.840]  he's doing it i mean it's incredible and now i wanted to get glenn spencer on
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:52.800]  because glenn was right all along liberals in southern arizona seek to
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:56.720]  form new state roiders new yorker magazine
[01:39:56.720 --> 01:40:00.800]  um arizona liberals are trying to form their own
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:05.040]  tiny liberal state on the border like the russian held abkhazia or south
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:08.640]  osetia as a as an area to project power into georgia
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:12.560]  51st states some in arizona want to split now when conservatives just want state
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:16.080]  rights back in to just have states not completely run by the feds
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:20.480]  it's called treason it's sedition uh secession evil
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:23.280]  but when they are seriously going to the legislature trying to get the
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:27.120]  signatures and they won't get it this time but it shows what they want it shows
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:29.920]  where they're going and then if you don't give them their ethnic
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:35.520]  homeland imagine if white folks tried this if you don't create these ethnic
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:39.520]  homelands well then you're a racist and i'll guarantee you down the road are
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:43.360]  the big race riots all of it planned and large areas of the u.s being broken
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:46.720]  off into this new multinational system now he predicted it all
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:50.800]  that's a five-minute intro glenn spencer you've got the floor you predicted
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:54.160]  all this with precision it's now begun break down exactly what's
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:58.640]  happening with the conquest of oslan not run out of mexico city but run out of
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:03.840]  new york city well yes uh
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:11.680]  tusan uh pima county uh part of the oslan movement uh isabel garcia
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:16.400]  who is on the payroll of pima county as an attorney in the public defender's
[01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:21.520]  office runs a group called that hos umanos
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:27.680]  uh human rights and she has huge banners and if you go on to her
[01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:35.040]  uh website that hos umanos you will see a graphic
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:41.360]  of a man that appears to be peering over a barbed wire fence and if it's the
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:46.000]  border but i analyzed the graphic and what
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.880]  appears to be a map of mexico isn't a map of mexico at all
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:56.640]  it's a map of mexico combined with the southwestern united states what they
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:42:02.880]  call oslan so this high official in pima county
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:07.440]  an attorney who has been on the payroll for more than a decade
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:12.160]  and is one of the most outspoken leaders of the la la movement
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:15.760]  and was there when they took over the school board last week
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:21.600]  cheering them on is uh uh works for the government of mexico
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:24.800]  is paid by the people of pima county and is
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:29.360]  advocating the takeover of the american southwest
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:33.600]  by mexico and reversing the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:37.840]  which was signed in 1848 now i don't think it took
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:41.680]  much for me to predict this kind of thing when these people are still out
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:45.280]  front of them and now we're hearing oh it's democratic
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:48.720]  it's loving and liberal uh secession is good
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:52.320]  when it's a larica and quiches it's cute a 51st state
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:55.280]  i mean they're really moving ahead with us right now break down this latest
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:59.200]  development who's behind that well the latest development
[01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:02.960]  is what we call the bahar arizona
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:06.800]  right uh this is for this is the people of the
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:12.560]  of pima county uh exactly who was behind it uh
[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:16.400]  i have an idea you sub that uh is a bell garcia
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:20.400]  she would be the leader of this movement uh she has been for
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:25.760]  four years uh nine years ago i wrote a letter to the administrator of pima
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:30.160]  county demanding that she be fired because of her
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:33.600]  subversive efforts i have if you go on american
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:37.840]  of control dot com and search for isabel garcia
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:45.920]  uh you will see uh nine years nine years of documentation
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:50.480]  of us tracking this woman okay and everything that she does
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:55.760]  so it is just like california when uh mario obledo
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:58.880]  well co-founder of mal death by the way which was
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:02.960]  financed by the fort foundation uh we have him on
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:06.720]  on tape on a radio station in california
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:10.240]  saying that california is going to be a hispanic state
[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:13.280]  and anyone who doesn't like it should leave
[01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:17.360]  okay now i have lots of stuff like that i had
[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:22.400]  three years before i produced a conquest of aslan
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:26.080]  but what surprises people when they hear me say these things with how can you
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:29.360]  say that well i can say it because they
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:33.920]  they say it uh and you're surprised because you've never heard it before
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:37.920]  because the mainstream media won't repeat it and by the way all over the
[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:41.520]  country uh the stations are called the invasion the
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:46.960]  infasura a la reconquista hundreds of billboards as you know went up in la
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:50.160]  it said uh los angeles california crossed out
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:54.240]  mexico it's all very funny why would anyone
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:58.560]  want to make the southwest mexico where you can't have private property unless
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:02.960]  you're an insider you can't own guns the police pull you over and demand
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:08.640]  money i mean it's just horribly corrupt uh it's an absolute hellhole uh and we
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:13.040]  have the the major corporations are media pushing this and trying to make
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:16.880]  all hispanics porto rican's uh mexicans that want to be you know
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:20.960]  free uh brazilians venezuelans they're told
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:25.600]  you better get with the program i mean this is so crazy
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:30.000]  well you know that this may sound strange to a lot of people
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:36.240]  but mexicans are very nationalistic they love their country and they're very
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:40.160]  nationalistic and you know one of the reasons they are
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:44.640]  you know that they've never had immigration and you say blend what do you
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:49.680]  mean by that well they're very insular uh because they've never learned to try
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:53.360]  to get along with us every oh they don't let anybody in and i mean
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:56.560]  that's the big you you got money that uh it's been very hard until
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:45:59.840]  recently for those that don't know it's even admitted the new york times
[01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:02.800]  mexico puts you in a forced labor camp for one year
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:10.160]  uh if you're caught but but they've taken polls uh you know in mexico
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:14.640]  and ask them what is it illegal to cross the border now
[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:19.680]  that they stole that loan from us uh and more than half of mexicans
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:23.600]  they look upon us as an enemy but a large percentage
[01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:27.680]  believes that the southwest was stolen from them and they have every right
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:30.960]  to take it back and that's what they're taught in their schools
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:34.720]  and that's what they're now being taught in our school
[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:38.320]  and that was the incredible thing about this uh
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:43.120]  the state of arizona passed a law that said you know you can no longer
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:49.760]  make mandatory courses in lasah they have to be
[01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:54.720]  electives in our high schools oh they had sir when i was in high school 20 years
[01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:59.840]  ago it was teachers with relish by the way white
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:03.520]  teachers uh telling me how bad america was and how great it was going to be
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:08.560]  when mexico took over america and and it's this it's this
[01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:12.320]  it's this america's committing suicide and
[01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:16.880]  and and it is a blessed sacrament of americans
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:20.400]  white black hispanic to destroy ourselves to be robbed by foreign banks
[01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:24.720]  to be the idiots of the world have to finance all these illegal wars
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:28.080]  uh and i mean if you go to mexico now i mean the state department says it's one
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:31.520]  of the most dangerous countries on earth it is a hellish pit
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:34.720]  they finally had to admit what you've documented for decades americans are
[01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:38.080]  targeted especially whites but the racial murder of whites as a
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:42.320]  sacrament whites deserve to die and whites want to die
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:45.680]  uh many white liberals believe it's it's it's good
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:49.520]  uh and i mean these are very sick self-destructive people
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:53.520]  and america probably will fall it won't fall to mexico it'll just fall into the
[01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:57.520]  lawless anarchy and squalor and sewage running down the streets and chickens
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:00.080]  running around everywhere and that's what america wants is what we're going to
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:03.360]  get blend well california is about to collapse
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:07.040]  uh california is the illegal immigration state
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:10.880]  uh it is about to collapse arizona is fighting back
[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:15.280]  it would pass sb 1070 and also recently passed the law
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:19.600]  uh that allows the state to build its own fence on the border
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:23.520]  and by the way i'll guarantee you if you put it on the tax forms the state tax
[01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:25.680]  forms if people want to give more money
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:29.680]  only that program people will put money on it but you can you can go online and
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:34.080]  donate to the fence absolutely you can go on it's called keep
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:40.080]  az safe dot com it is an official state of arizona website
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:44.160]  which i have donated to well you know here's what's so sick glenn
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:47.360]  i could care less what color you are i could care
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:51.760]  less but i shouldn't even have to sit here and say that i'm not the one with
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:57.520]  groups called raza i'm not the one with school books saying the southwest
[01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:01.520]  belongs to mexico and it was hardly anybody in the southwest desert wasteland
[01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:07.120]  a few missions mexico kept starting wars with the united states and losing them
[01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:11.040]  sorry their military was so corrupt that their soldiers would fight but their
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:16.000]  generals would cut and run and and and i mean who would want i mean
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.720]  they're running up here america isn't perfect but they're running up here
[01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:22.560]  because there's some private property some second amendment some dignity
[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:26.160]  you know our cops are the feds are trying to corrupt them but the average
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:29.920]  cop in america you know it's very rare to have cops just pull you over and
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:32.960]  demand money you're absolutely right i'm on the
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:37.120]  mexican border right now i'm looking into mexico
[01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:41.520]  i fly the border american border patrol surveys the border we're called america's
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:46.240]  eyes on the border and i support keep az safe dot com
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:50.160]  because the state of arizona is going to do some work
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:53.280]  now let me tell you something and you haven't heard this before but we've
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:57.680]  been working on technology on the border for nine years we were the first to use
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:50:02.080]  uavs and so forth last year we stumbled upon and
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:08.160]  discovered a way to secure the border to count to detect
[01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:12.480]  everybody who crosses the border and count them at a
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:17.200]  fraction of the cost of what the Boeing has been doing and the state of arizona
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:21.600]  has seen a demonstration of this and we hope that maybe if they
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:25.360]  are able to come up with the funding at the state level
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:30.000]  we hope to convince them to test this out now i have put a half mile of what i
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.880]  call the sonic barrier on our ranch right here
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:36.960]  along the border you cannot get past it you can't keep till past it
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:40.400]  it'll detect ultra lights it'll detect tunnels
[01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:46.240]  it does the whole thing stay there stay there but the fact that arizona
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:50.320]  with black white hispanic asian americans are standing up to the crime
[01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:53.120]  wave the tyranny the murder the death the bedlam
[01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:56.800]  that's now drawing out the laricum cases and the ford foundation to try this
[01:50:56.800 --> 01:50:59.680]  secession movement next they're going to start getting violent

[01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:08.880]  other free radical is with glutathione glutathione

[01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:32.960]  not the whiskey drinking indian or the marine that went to war
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:37.760]  look it's very simple the fortune 500 generally but definitely the fortune
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:43.040]  100 financed created this whole liberation theology
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:45.760]  there was a little bit of this going on in mexico before
[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:50.000]  because mexico has been nationalistic that's not a negative overall
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:53.520]  and it's been hyped but it's force-fed here in the u.s
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:57.200]  it's extremely aggressive and it's coming to a head to the point that these
[01:54:57.200 --> 01:55:00.400]  groups are now trying to break off part of the u.s to basically
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:06.640]  be a little enclave of mexico and uh you try to talk to these people
[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:10.320]  and and they they are just openly you're evil because you're white
[01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:16.640]  and i'm like well why don't we just be friends they're like no
[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:19.600]  and i've been to some of these of events here in austin
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:24.080]  you know they have their uh you know big parades and things and
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:27.680]  the fact is most hispanics i know aren't into this but the people leading
[01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:31.840]  you know the big official mexican uh you know day parades and things it is a
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:37.280]  race meeting and you go out there and and and it's wrong and the point is
[01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:41.360]  the mega corporations glenn want everybody fighting with each other
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:45.840]  from your decades of research why are the big corporations trying
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:51.040]  to get uh everybody fighting with each other why are they promoting
[01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:57.200]  uh these uh you know different movements um what's movement they don't
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:00.960]  want the nation's state you know because you get in the way of uh
[01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:05.680]  of of their growth uh but you know 15 years ago alex i told the
[01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:09.360]  meetings in los angeles you won't know you're being invaded
[01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:14.240]  until you try to stop it the reason that we're seeing this reaction in
[01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:19.520]  arizona is because the state of arizona is standing up and passing laws to
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:23.200]  defend itself the reason you don't see this kind of thing in
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:26.560]  california is that their popular politicians are
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:31.760]  capitulating they are surrendering every day right and left
[01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:37.120]  so you don't see this backlash because they are taking over california and
[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:41.040]  they're in the process of completing that takeover the reason you're seeing
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:45.280]  this in arizona is that the state of arizona is resisting
[01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:49.520]  that's that's the only and now is california openly collapses with 33
[01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:53.360]  percent unemployment rate we are going to have to bail them out via the federal
[01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:57.200]  government and the federal government openly wants this because they're run
[01:56:57.200 --> 01:57:00.240]  by globalist traders but that's because the house of
[01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:04.800]  representatives run by republicans is not going to allow it and that is a
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:08.160]  major struggle that you should watch everybody should watch
[01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:13.920]  because california is bankrupt bankrupt and let me ask you this then
[01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:17.120]  let me ask you this let me ask you this you've had an
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:20.960]  incredible crystal ball gland give us the lay of the battlefield
[01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:23.280]  right now and what you're predicting is going to happen next
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:28.880]  for the battlefield is right now in arizona because arizona is resisting
[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:32.800]  and by the way i'm always impressed when i go on your show
[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:36.160]  are the hits on our site just been a quadruple
[01:57:36.160 --> 01:57:40.000]  so we've got a lot of people looking at american patrol dot com right now
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:43.920]  and you'll notice at the top it says arizona help arizona build the
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:48.160]  border fence the state of arizona and the governor signed a law
[01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:52.000]  to allow them to take private donations to
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:55.440]  to to defend themselves against this invasion
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:59.200]  and they can build a fence and they can do other things and so i'm encouraged
[01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:03.760]  it's already raised a billion and a half dollars 34th down this is showing the
[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:06.560]  power this is showing the power of the people but look
[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:11.920]  mexico is a failed narco-terrorist state right mexico has a complete border with
[01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:14.880]  guatemala and puts people in forced labor for a year
[01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:18.880]  how can mexico have some of the most draconian immigration laws in the world
[01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:22.880]  but then lecture us when we have the most wide open system in the world
[01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:27.680]  first that they want to move their people north it's all in my video they

[02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:43.200]  happening uh speaking with glenn spencer we now
[02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:47.760]  have the move to break off part of southern
[02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:51.200]  arizona and make it a pro open border enclave
[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:55.760]  of mexico and we have basically mexican government
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:00:59.360]  minions in there in the tucson government
[02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:05.120]  pushing this the system is panicking the mega corporations want open borders
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:09.040]  mexico wants to export its revolution
[02:01:09.040 --> 02:01:13.120]  into the u.s as a steam valve instead of their people ever getting freedom over
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:16.000]  the incredibly corrupt oligarchy they've got
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:19.680]  glenn spencer what is the official policy of the mexican government
[02:01:19.680 --> 02:01:23.200]  here is the mexican president it's about 11 seconds
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:26.400]  speaking to the national council of la rosa
[02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:30.960]  in 1997 this is the deal now listen to this
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:35.280]  i have proudly affirmed that the mexican nation
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:41.040]  extends beyond the territory enclosed by its borders
[02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:48.240]  and the mexican migrants are an important a very important part of it
[02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:51.920]  okay i have proudly affirmed that the mexican nation extends beyond the
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:56.720]  territory enclosed by its borders and that mexican migrants aren't important
[02:01:56.720 --> 02:02:00.560]  a very important part of it so they're extending their borders by
[02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:05.040]  migration okay it's called demographic warfare
[02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:10.560]  is to putting the southwest under their jurisdiction i said this 11 years ago
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:15.520]  they are at it they are and because there was resistance in arizona they're
[02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:18.160]  fighting back they're getting the support of the
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:23.120]  mexican government their agents are working here full time
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:27.440]  and our own government it's now come out we've had sheriffs on records say what
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:30.560]  we already knew that the border patrol has been
[02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:33.760]  ordered not to arrest illegals except for very short
[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:40.400]  pr stunts for the media and this i mean is this not treason
[02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:42.800]  it is treason
[02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:47.760]  i have been i have been at this so many years everything they do on the border
[02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:52.080]  is designed to fail everything the national guard they put down here i
[02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:55.280]  have aerial photographs of every one of the national guard outposts
[02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:59.120]  they are a joke i like i'm going to detail with it
[02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:04.880]  they are useless because everything they do the billion dollars that they
[02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:08.560]  spent on that virtual fence i the day it came out and then they
[02:03:08.560 --> 02:03:12.400]  announced it i predicted it would fail i went online and i said this is going to
[02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:17.040]  fail and i said why okay that was five years ago
[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:20.720]  and it failed exactly for the reason that i said
[02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:25.280]  everything they do on the border is designed to fail
[02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:34.480]  our government wants that border left and what so sick is everybody would
[02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:37.920]  live in peace and we would get along
[02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:43.200]  if uh whites weren't told we're inherently
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:46.960]  evil and bad and deserve to be killed by the media
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:51.200]  and that it's cute and fun to have all these mayors including the former
[02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:54.000]  austin mayor saying that hispanics are the god race
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.960]  i mean i'm sorry i don't like the clan i don't like that either
[02:03:56.960 --> 02:04:00.560]  but but we don't have the clan having public meetings
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:03.680]  and openly talking like this and and and it's time
[02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:07.760]  it's time for hispanic americans uh white black doesn't matter what color
[02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:10.960]  you are if you understand what's happening and where this road leads
[02:04:10.960 --> 02:04:15.120]  to stand up and say no because the big megabanks that are so criminal that are
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:18.720]  financing all of this on record they're not pushing oslon
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:22.800]  because they care about hispanic people they want to destroy the only escape
[02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:26.160]  route for people in latin america to ever have a future of liberty
[02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:30.400]  and i'll tell you uh it's people's minds that i don't
[02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:34.080]  like it's not the color of their skin and and you know glenn you know it these
[02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:37.600]  uh illegals they vote to take guns and take property and vote for socialism
[02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:41.520]  and let me tell you this country's in a death struggle right now aren't they

[02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:58.400]  of issues uh today mr boogly oc what what would you
[02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:04.000]  like to begin with uh first revisiting the manson murders uh your new book
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:08.880]  uh george w bush and your call to prosecute him for murder
[02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:12.560]  and uh the fact that obama's continuing many of those same crimes what's your
[02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:16.160]  view of of him now uh where do you want to start first
[02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:20.000]  well i thought it was going to be about the book uh my new book uh divinity of
[02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.880]  doubt i normally do not go back unless there's
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:26.960]  some questions on all these other things or else we end up after the hour uh
[02:13:26.960 --> 02:13:30.400]  with uh hardy touching on the main reason i thought the main reason for the
[02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:32.880]  interview today but by the way alex before i go any further
[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:35.680]  i want to thank you so much for having me on your show in the first place that's
[02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:38.880]  always an honor for me uh you're the best in the business but i was under the
[02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:42.720]  impression that the basic interview today at least i was told that was going to
[02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:47.120]  be on divinity you know i'm sorry i'm vince and i i mean
[02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:50.800]  your publicist as i was there when i was on speakerphone asked what it was
[02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:52.720]  about and we said yeah we're going to cover the book
[02:13:52.720 --> 02:13:55.760]  and a host of other issues that's fine that's fine
[02:13:55.760 --> 02:13:59.680]  uh in fact in fact there was only one thing which i didn't even plan to bring
[02:13:59.680 --> 02:14:02.000]  up to you that she didn't want to get into which
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:05.040]  begs the question it makes me want to get into it so that that's proving their
[02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:08.080]  prosecutor that i did have that conversation with the publicist oh yeah
[02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:12.000]  no no no i you want to cross examine me no no no no no but what they sent me is
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:15.120]  that this was just uh interview uh on my book
[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:18.320]  look let me just touch on on two things and then hopefully we can get into the
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:22.640]  book let's get to the book first then or no no no no i want to get uh two things
[02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:25.920]  out of the way the reclaiming history the assassination president john f kennedy
[02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:29.200]  i just want your readers to know or your audience to know that this is going to
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:34.160]  be a eight-hour mini series for hbo that tom hanks and his people are doing
[02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:39.600]  based on the book um on the 50th anniversary which is 2013 50th
[02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:43.040]  50th anniversary of the kennedy assassination about the prosecution of
[02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:46.960]  george w bush for murder many people have felt that it's all
[02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:51.120]  over with now they don't hear from me i can tell you uh it's very very much
[02:14:51.120 --> 02:14:55.040]  still alive i'll be getting next week a report from a constitutional law
[02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:58.240]  professor back east who with 12 members of his class
[02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:02.160]  have put together a legal brief anticipating
[02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:06.240]  all legal arguments that if there is a prosecution that bush and his people
[02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:09.840]  could come up with to have a case thrown out of court i'll be getting that
[02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:14.320]  report next week i have to be very careful elix about my words but i can
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:18.720]  tell you this i can tell your audience this it's still very much alive and i
[02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:22.240]  am making progress i can't say anything more than that but it's still very much
[02:15:22.240 --> 02:15:26.400]  alive uh another interesting point a documentary
[02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:29.840]  based on the book the prosecution of george w bush for murder
[02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:34.240]  uh will be coming out for the big screen and in about uh six months
[02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:39.200]  but i'm convinced beyond all reasonable doubt that bush took the nation to war
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:44.160]  under false pretenses in iraq 4500 american soldiers are in their cold
[02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:48.000]  graves right now as i'm talking to you elix and yet bush whenever you hear
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:51.840]  him he says things like i'm living life to the fullest i'm happy
[02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:56.720]  and i want to take that smile off his face in addition to the 4500 american
[02:15:56.720 --> 02:16:00.320]  soldiers probably at least a hundred thousand innocent iraqi men women
[02:16:00.320 --> 02:16:03.680]  children and babies are in their graves right now so i want your audience to
[02:16:03.680 --> 02:16:08.480]  know this is still very much alive and that's why i wanted to bring up some
[02:16:08.480 --> 02:16:11.280]  of those subjects because you you're involved in so many
[02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:14.720]  important interesting things and you know you you cover the white house memo
[02:16:14.720 --> 02:16:19.200]  the downing treatment mo it's on record oh yeah that they premeditatedly
[02:16:19.200 --> 02:16:23.520]  lied to take us to war they weren't wrong about wmds what's your view of
[02:16:23.520 --> 02:16:25.600]  obama because i supported your move to
[02:16:25.600 --> 02:16:29.760]  prosecute w but obama has continued the rendition continued the torture
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:32.880]  continued the black sites continued guantanamo
[02:16:32.880 --> 02:16:36.560]  continued expanding things with uh you know faulty intelligence
[02:16:36.560 --> 02:16:42.240]  i mean are you disappointed with obama well uh he turns out to be a guy who is
[02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:46.160]  hard as probably the right place but he has no courage of uh no courage
[02:16:46.160 --> 02:16:49.520]  whatsoever but but let's distinguish between taking a nation
[02:16:49.520 --> 02:16:53.360]  deliberately to war uh on a lie under false pretenses
[02:16:53.360 --> 02:16:56.960]  with doing things that everyone knows about i mean bush did not let the
[02:16:56.960 --> 02:17:00.480]  nation know that they were going to war on a lie did not let them know that
[02:17:00.480 --> 02:17:03.920]  everything that obama is doing as far as i know it may be right or wrong
[02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:07.600]  but there's no deception involved i can say this
[02:17:07.600 --> 02:17:12.640]  about what happened recently with uh the uh the killing of uh osama
[02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:18.960]  i'm disappointed in in old uh in obama as well as bush for not going into
[02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:24.240]  uh pakistan immediately after nine eleven or immediately after
[02:17:24.240 --> 02:17:28.000]  uh osama escaped into pakistan by the way
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:34.640]  uh what's his name osama was at toro borah the cia asked for 800 troops to go
[02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:39.840]  up the mountain into toro borah to get bin laden the bush administration said no
[02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:46.000]  so he had uh but he had no hesitancy uh about sending 150 thousand troops into
[02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:49.760]  iraq to get who's saying someone who had as much to do
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:53.680]  with nine eleven as you are an on of mine who lives up in minnesota but yet he
[02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:58.160]  wouldn't set 800 troops up the mountain in toro borah to get uh
[02:17:58.160 --> 02:18:02.080]  uh osama bin laden who's responsible for 3 000 american murders and as you know
[02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:06.480]  he escaped over the border into pakistan we didn't we didn't want to invade
[02:18:06.480 --> 02:18:10.000]  sure it was sure but i mean expanding on that official narrative there
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:14.160]  he needed that bogeyman to blame it on iraq he couldn't have been lauding dead
[02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:19.760]  at least admit that uh he was dead uh and and and so that's why they didn't
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:23.840]  i mean my inside sources are bin laden's been dead a long time but vince
[02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:25.840]  and i know you're not going to agree with that
[02:18:25.840 --> 02:18:29.600]  i don't know if he was dead earlier or not
[02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:34.800]  but anyway um uh osama bin laden if he was just killed recently uh he's been
[02:18:34.800 --> 02:18:38.560]  alive for close to 10 years he's had three uh good meals a day
[02:18:38.560 --> 02:18:43.040]  and uh they should have gone after him uh if they want it if they were thinking
[02:18:43.040 --> 02:18:46.720]  old pakistan is a sovereign nation we can't cross the border to pakistan
[02:18:46.720 --> 02:18:50.720]  yet they could cross the border into iraq to go after guy with nothing to do with
[02:18:50.720 --> 02:18:54.880]  nine eleven you follow so i'm i'm i'm happy that they got osama assuming
[02:18:54.880 --> 02:18:56.720]  that they got him you're saying maybe they didn't
[02:18:56.720 --> 02:19:01.520]  well i mean look you're a prosecutor pardon they've got the body they don't
[02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:04.960]  give it to us they have the face print the photos they won't give us that
[02:19:04.960 --> 02:19:09.120]  they throw the body in the ocean i mean this whole thing really stinks
[02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:13.040]  well to high heaven at a minimum it was an extremely unwise move
[02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:17.200]  for uh obama to dispose of the body so quickly into the ocean like that i mean
[02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:21.120]  a common sense which uh maltaire tells us not common would tell you you don't do
[02:19:21.120 --> 02:19:26.320]  that but if he is the ultimate uh terror mastermind and ksm is
[02:19:26.320 --> 02:19:29.840]  telling us under torture that there's buried nukes in europe in the u.s and
[02:19:29.840 --> 02:19:34.480]  ap's running with it you better uh capture him even if he's
[02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:36.960]  trying to kill you but it turns out that was all lies
[02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:41.600]  didn't have a weapon didn't shoot back uh now the situation room photo turns out
[02:19:41.600 --> 02:19:44.800]  they weren't watching video they lied about that i mean vencent we're getting
[02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:49.280]  a lot of lies here when witnesses start telling us chains of lies
[02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:52.880]  uh i mean it's it's it's illegal to lie to federal prosecutors
[02:19:52.880 --> 02:19:57.040]  but how how can government lie so much yeah i know that well it's intrinsic in
[02:19:57.040 --> 02:20:00.320]  human nature that people lie if they think they can get by with it that's
[02:20:00.320 --> 02:20:05.200]  true and it's their uh uh it's their benefit now i'm i'm not on top of all
[02:20:05.200 --> 02:20:09.280]  the stuff that you're talking about you are i got enough on my plate with the
[02:20:09.280 --> 02:20:13.520]  current book and of course hopefully i'll be able to prosecute uh bush um
[02:20:13.520 --> 02:20:17.120]  it'll be a d a it'll be if it happens it'll be a d a not the federal
[02:20:17.120 --> 02:20:20.240]  government uh not the state government but a local d a
[02:20:20.240 --> 02:20:23.600]  and i'm i'll be working if it happens around the clock seven days a week
[02:20:23.600 --> 02:20:26.400]  probably living in a motel for a couple years
[02:20:26.400 --> 02:20:30.160]  so that's on my plate right now and i hate to give opinions on things
[02:20:30.160 --> 02:20:33.520]  i understand but visible then fine fine research you know let's say this
[02:20:33.520 --> 02:20:36.320]  though you are going up against bush if you start getting this prosecution
[02:20:36.320 --> 02:20:39.840]  going and there's open talk about going after the torture even in foreign
[02:20:39.840 --> 02:20:43.840]  government but uh even in our own right i hope you don't end up like some of
[02:20:43.840 --> 02:20:46.880]  these other reporters that slit their wrist do you want to say on record that
[02:20:46.880 --> 02:20:51.680]  you're not suicidal you're you're great alec no i am not
[02:20:51.680 --> 02:20:56.560]  suicidal no i'm not suicidal but i i'll tell you this there's
[02:20:56.560 --> 02:21:00.320]  reasons for not doing it uh personal reasons but i don't think i can look at
[02:21:00.320 --> 02:21:03.440]  myself in the mirror if i walked away from this not not with all these people
[02:21:03.440 --> 02:21:07.760]  in their graves right now uh decomposing as i'm talking but you realize it is
[02:21:07.760 --> 02:21:11.280]  dangerous to go up against the bush mafia i'm aware of that and i i usually
[02:21:11.280 --> 02:21:14.720]  don't like to talk to this talk about this stuff publicly but you're almost
[02:21:14.720 --> 02:21:18.640]  uh compelling me to do so there are reasons for my not doing this
[02:21:18.640 --> 02:21:21.920]  but the most important man in the world is the man in the mirror if you're
[02:21:21.920 --> 02:21:24.880]  doing right by hand then you're treating other people well too
[02:21:24.880 --> 02:21:30.480]  and i don't see how i could walk away uh from this i would just be saying to
[02:21:30.480 --> 02:21:32.960]  myself you know then so you're no different than anyone else so i'm
[02:21:32.960 --> 02:21:35.920]  going to proceed on this thing if i given the opportunity
[02:21:35.920 --> 02:21:40.240]  i want to be made very very clear i do not have a firm commitment at all so i
[02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:43.440]  don't want any distortion what i'm saying but i'm telling you i'm making
[02:21:43.440 --> 02:21:47.120]  progress and uh i don't want this guy to get away with
[02:21:47.120 --> 02:21:50.160]  murder i don't want to see anyone get away with murder well it took a long
[02:21:50.160 --> 02:21:52.640]  time to go after peniche so these things
[02:21:52.640 --> 02:21:55.680]  absolutely some no statute of limitations for murder but
[02:21:55.680 --> 02:21:59.680]  uh a simpson got away with two murders i got so angry that i wrote a book
[02:21:59.680 --> 02:22:03.280]  called outrage the five reasons why oj simpson got away with murder shot up
[02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:06.880]  the number one new york times if i could get that angry over two murders you
[02:22:06.880 --> 02:22:10.800]  can imagine how i feel about george bush i have i have an animus against this
[02:22:10.800 --> 02:22:14.000]  guy well what about him writing a book last year
[02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:18.000]  bragging he ordered torture and would do it again but they're underlings
[02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:21.600]  that they flushed down the toilet as scapegoats how can
[02:22:21.600 --> 02:22:25.600]  how can the mafia don't give an order admit he gets the gives the order
[02:22:25.600 --> 02:22:31.040]  but then his street level muscle goes to jail i mean bush is publicly admitting
[02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:35.520]  to ordering crimes and ordering the white house memos i mean i don't see how
[02:22:35.520 --> 02:22:39.200]  he isn't in prison for that yeah but we're getting to an area that i'm not
[02:22:39.200 --> 02:22:42.480]  up from i'm very very familiar with this take the nation award a lie when you
[02:22:42.480 --> 02:22:46.160]  get into the torture thing you also have to realize and no obama and holder of
[02:22:46.160 --> 02:22:51.040]  both said this that uh the department of justice the lawyers over there gave
[02:22:51.040 --> 02:22:54.800]  bush permission to do certain things now apparently some
[02:22:54.800 --> 02:22:58.960]  cia lowly operatives went beyond that you follow but we're getting into an
[02:22:58.960 --> 02:23:02.240]  issue that i'm not up on let's shift gears back then i got a few loose ends
[02:23:02.240 --> 02:23:06.560]  then we'll get into your new book okay um uh you know a few loose ends i've had
[02:23:06.560 --> 02:23:09.840]  prosecutors on the the county attorney
[02:23:09.840 --> 02:23:13.760]  in the county that san francisco is based in the aya yeah yeah saying
[02:23:13.760 --> 02:23:18.560]  yeah district attorney that if he sees uh if his police see them touching on the
[02:23:18.560 --> 02:23:21.840]  outside of the pants it's a misdemeanor on the inside of the
[02:23:21.840 --> 02:23:24.480]  pants felonies i have witnessed them sticking their
[02:23:24.480 --> 02:23:28.240]  hands down people's pants not just all the videos of six year old girls
[02:23:28.240 --> 02:23:32.240]  20 plus states are moving to make it felonies but if it's already a felony
[02:23:32.240 --> 02:23:35.920]  for a cop to do it without emergency probable cause or for you to do it or
[02:23:35.920 --> 02:23:38.960]  for the easter buddy to do it how do we even need laws
[02:23:38.960 --> 02:23:43.280]  what's your view on the whole tsa sticking the hands down the pants
[02:23:43.280 --> 02:23:48.400]  are you literally talking about someone uh molesting uh sexually molesting
[02:23:48.400 --> 02:23:52.080]  someone or are you using this as a metaphor i don't know no the tsa sir
[02:23:52.080 --> 02:23:57.680]  now sticks their hands down means what uh the the the the airport security
[02:23:57.680 --> 02:24:01.120]  oh okay they're doing what now they're sticking their hands down people's
[02:24:01.120 --> 02:24:05.280]  pants is that right i just i just traveled to new york uh
[02:24:05.280 --> 02:24:08.640]  for the only randomly do it with small children and women that's that's why
[02:24:08.640 --> 02:24:11.280]  they get the job yeah i don't know what their intent
[02:24:11.280 --> 02:24:14.880]  is if you can show that their intent i don't know how you do this showing that
[02:24:14.880 --> 02:24:18.320]  that a sexual obviously should be a felony but i i didn't even know about
[02:24:18.320 --> 02:24:21.600]  this but but but how can everyone be guilty until
[02:24:21.600 --> 02:24:24.720]  proven innocent i mean a police officer can't stick their hand on your pants
[02:24:24.720 --> 02:24:27.360]  unless they saw you stick the gun in there and there's imminent danger
[02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:32.640]  according to uh da's people we've had on uh we both had county and city
[02:24:32.640 --> 02:24:36.880]  it's just too hard for me to comment on that uh but today's show just just called
[02:24:36.880 --> 02:24:41.120]  me about four or five days ago apparently uh they have on film the phoenix
[02:24:41.120 --> 02:24:44.000]  either the police department sheriff's office um
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:48.880]  uh brutal brutalizing some woman on film in phoenix and they wanted me on the
[02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:52.560]  show and i don't go on just if i don't feel i'm qualified to do it i said
[02:24:52.560 --> 02:24:56.400]  listen i don't know what's going on here i'd have to study it in depth so i
[02:24:56.400 --> 02:25:01.360]  referred them to internal affairs of some major cities so i i did not go on
[02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:05.920]  i hate to be on the record saying things all right and someone comes back to what
[02:25:05.920 --> 02:25:08.160]  but you'll see you don't know what you're talking about did you know that this
[02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:11.760]  was a exist i said no i didn't know about that no i got it you didn't see the
[02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:15.200]  six-year-old you didn't see the six-year-old with the with the tsa
[02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:19.680]  sticking their hands down her pants no listen uh i i don't i don't watch uh
[02:25:19.680 --> 02:25:24.800]  tv uh i understand you're a busy guy let me no no it's not it's not just that
[02:25:24.800 --> 02:25:28.400]  yeah i am busy i don't even have a computer i'm still in the 19th century
[02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:31.280]  with a yellow patent pencil so a lot of these things are going over my head
[02:25:31.280 --> 02:25:35.440]  and i really have to focus in on something before i start let's let's talk
[02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:37.840]  about something let's talk about something you focused in on and then
[02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:42.160]  we'll do the remainder of the half hour just on the new book uh and and break
[02:25:42.160 --> 02:25:45.600]  that down for folks vincent boogliosi the probably one of the most famous
[02:25:45.600 --> 02:25:49.360]  prosecutors in world history uh here joining us not just in the modern era
[02:25:50.400 --> 02:25:55.760]  looking at this uh something you do know about you've written this a giant treat
[02:25:55.760 --> 02:26:01.760]  as this encyclopedia uh that has been hailed by much of the establishment
[02:26:01.760 --> 02:26:07.120]  media uh as as definitive proof that uh lone gunman killed jfk and dealie
[02:26:07.120 --> 02:26:15.200]  plaza 40 plus years ago what do you say to things uh like uh e howard hunt uh
[02:26:15.200 --> 02:26:20.400]  and uh saying he was there running an operation what do you say uh to the
[02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:24.720]  people that saw people behind the knoll and then all mysteriously died i mean
[02:26:24.720 --> 02:26:29.680]  how can i get into that without taking a half hour here alec i mean i appreciate
[02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:33.360]  what you're saying but to take one there was no one behind the knoll there no
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:37.840]  one saw anyone there you follow no one saw that they they did not to live wait a
[02:26:37.840 --> 02:26:40.640]  while wait a while wait a while they did one behind the knoll thinking there
[02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:44.320]  may be someone there all the stuff about seeing people to know that all came
[02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:49.360]  about later alec's i worked on this thing for 20 years but to raise an issue like
[02:26:49.360 --> 02:26:54.080]  this uh i'm supposed to give you a 10 second answer to it uh the e howard hunt
[02:26:54.080 --> 02:26:57.360]  thing uh while he was alive he was on his deathbed
[02:26:57.360 --> 02:27:01.680]  and his sons were trying to get this out of him okay and they never got out of
[02:27:01.680 --> 02:27:04.800]  him any statement by him this was after my book came out
[02:27:04.800 --> 02:27:08.480]  they yeah the cia was involved he never said that but they were trying to get
[02:27:08.480 --> 02:27:12.720]  these words out of him uh the their sister the mother they're very
[02:27:12.720 --> 02:27:16.240]  condemnatory of these two sons that started off that's the cuban side of
[02:27:16.240 --> 02:27:20.160]  the family uh down into something i can't i can't i can't get into this i

[02:33:42.400 --> 02:33:45.520]  system i'm like wow he's great to have on let's have him on but
[02:33:45.520 --> 02:33:49.520]  the new book is uh divinity of doubt the god question
[02:33:49.520 --> 02:33:53.280]  and you go to vincen buglio see you go to the mountain he will tell you who

[02:33:56.880 --> 02:34:00.320]  tell you if god exists uh actually the book i haven't
[02:34:00.320 --> 02:34:03.520]  read it yet but it's been critically acclaimed
[02:34:03.520 --> 02:34:06.960]  uh and i'm gonna stop trying to be sarcastic or with him because i like
[02:34:06.960 --> 02:34:09.440]  him he's a sharp guy i agree with him on some things
[02:34:09.440 --> 02:34:13.520]  disagree with him on others uh but the divinity of god and that's the new
[02:34:13.520 --> 02:34:17.680]  book divinity of doubt the god question and why did you decide to
[02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:21.200]  write this book well elix as you know i like
[02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:24.800]  challenges big challenges and there's probably no bigger challenge than uh
[02:34:24.800 --> 02:34:29.280]  uh taken on the god question and let me say that i'm more excited about this
[02:34:29.280 --> 02:34:33.600]  book than any other book in my entire career and that's not just because
[02:34:33.600 --> 02:34:37.520]  so there's no bigger subject than god but we're talking here elix about a
[02:34:37.520 --> 02:34:40.720]  2000 year old conversation in which everyone agrees nothing
[02:34:40.720 --> 02:34:44.240]  significant has been brought to the table in a great number of years
[02:34:44.240 --> 02:34:48.080]  and believe it or not this book does that can i have a couple moments elix
[02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:50.400]  just to go over some of the highlights of the book i'm about to learn the
[02:34:50.400 --> 02:34:52.080]  mysteries of the universe from the great boogly
[02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:56.000]  oh god and i told you off the air in addition to
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.480]  mean great you're the test you're also a funny guy
[02:34:58.480 --> 02:35:01.840]  you're very funny you're getting me to laugh i used to laugh that much
[02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:05.200]  um you hear people say all the time elix that
[02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:09.440]  god gave all of us free will and if you challenge them on it they'll say it's
[02:35:09.440 --> 02:35:13.360]  in the bible but i found out that uh uh
[02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:17.040]  contrary to popular belief that the bible does not say there's free will
[02:35:17.040 --> 02:35:21.280]  instead it says the precise opposite that there is no free will now i don't
[02:35:21.280 --> 02:35:24.560]  have to tell you the enormous ramifications of this
[02:35:24.560 --> 02:35:28.880]  how do you explain god's punishment of evildoers if it turns out that what
[02:35:28.880 --> 02:35:32.480]  they did was preordained by god no no no mind you elix
[02:35:32.480 --> 02:35:35.200]  i'm not saying there's no free will how would i know if someone asked me i'd
[02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:37.920]  say well ask my neighbor or ask or ask the local
[02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:41.840]  grocer however when they say uh when christianity
[02:35:41.840 --> 02:35:46.160]  says that uh the bible says uh that there's free will at that point i can
[02:35:46.160 --> 02:35:48.400]  step in and say wait a while folks the bible
[02:35:48.400 --> 02:35:51.360]  does not say that let me give you just a couple quick quick
[02:35:51.360 --> 02:35:58.800]  uh of citations isaias 63 17 says lord why do you cause us some free will
[02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:02.400]  elix why do you cause us to stray from thy ways
[02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:09.840]  roman uh 1132 god consigns all men to disobedience
[02:36:09.840 --> 02:36:14.640]  uh the talmudic scholars have been uh struggling for eight for centuries over
[02:36:14.640 --> 02:36:19.120]  how can they get around exodus 421 where god tells moses
[02:36:19.120 --> 02:36:22.880]  uh i will harden the heart of the pharaoh
[02:36:22.880 --> 02:36:27.040]  causing him to be stubborn and not release uh the people referring to the
[02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:30.480]  israelite in egypt apparently justifying his inflection
[02:36:30.480 --> 02:36:38.080]  of of of the ten uh of the ten plagues it turns out elix that the um
[02:36:38.080 --> 02:36:43.200]  uh the immortality of the soul was a pure invention of play-doh i traced it
[02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:46.320]  all the way back to play-doh which christianity was almost
[02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:51.760]  forced to um embrace why because without the immortality of the soul there's no
[02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:54.960]  life after death without life after death there's no heaven and hell and i
[02:36:54.960 --> 02:36:59.600]  would ask you the rhetorical question elix how does christianity
[02:36:59.600 --> 02:37:02.960]  survive how does it stay alive if there's no heaven and hell i mean
[02:37:02.960 --> 02:37:06.800]  this is what they offer or threaten their followers with
[02:37:06.800 --> 02:37:10.400]  well let me ask you this question um vincent yeah
[02:37:10.400 --> 02:37:17.520]  um i mean i've studied egyptology they believed that uh the soul could be
[02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:21.520]  immortal but it needed a place to dwell in kind of like a ghost and there were
[02:37:21.520 --> 02:37:23.920]  many other cultures that predate play-doh
[02:37:23.920 --> 02:37:29.280]  2300 years ago or whatever uh and i mean uh you're saying
[02:37:29.280 --> 02:37:32.960]  sure a lot of the bible was out of aramaic into greek and then back and
[02:37:32.960 --> 02:37:36.800]  forth but uh i i don't know i i mean i haven't done current
[02:37:36.800 --> 02:37:40.320]  research on this to pull it up fresh but i don't i don't know if that's true
[02:37:40.320 --> 02:37:44.320]  that uh play-doh invented the immortal soul well it probably had been mentioned
[02:37:44.320 --> 02:37:46.960]  somewhere but he's the one in in the dialogue
[02:37:46.960 --> 02:37:52.960]  fadris p-h-a-e-d-r-u-s that articulated the entire doctrine and and from their
[02:37:52.960 --> 02:37:57.040]  Judaism about intuit uh and uh and then christianity
[02:37:57.040 --> 02:38:00.560]  in fadris uh what what play-doh does he
[02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:05.440]  presupposes the existence of god he presupposes the existence of the soul
[02:38:05.440 --> 02:38:09.600]  he presupposes that the soul is immortal because he presupposes
[02:38:09.600 --> 02:38:13.760]  that it was never born and uh like i say in the book if we presuppose i had
[02:38:13.760 --> 02:38:18.720]  wings uh maybe i could fly but uh i want to go beyond this
[02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:21.360]  uh because there's several other things here's probably the most
[02:38:21.360 --> 02:38:24.640]  startling thing in the entire book and believe me i wouldn't have written the
[02:38:24.640 --> 02:38:27.120]  book if i didn't have some startling things to say but this is probably the
[02:38:27.120 --> 02:38:30.880]  most startling thing i found evidence alex in the new
[02:38:30.880 --> 02:38:35.440]  testament which when read in conjunction with the hebrew bible
[02:38:35.440 --> 02:38:39.440]  proves not just beyond a reasonable doubt but beyond all doubt according to the
[02:38:39.440 --> 02:38:43.760]  bible now that jesus was not born of a virgin
[02:38:43.760 --> 02:38:47.680]  uh which by definition means he's not the son of god if he's not the son of god
[02:38:47.680 --> 02:38:51.920]  then the christian doctrine that god had a son dying across bar sins
[02:38:51.920 --> 02:38:58.400]  goes out the window to uh ravaging much of christianity uh i know this is very
[02:38:58.400 --> 02:39:01.520]  very hard for your audience to believe the only problems that happens to be the
[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:04.800]  truth and this is one reason why many people reading the divinity of doubt
[02:39:04.800 --> 02:39:09.360]  say that no one reads this book will ever again feel the same way
[02:39:09.360 --> 02:39:13.440]  about god and religion i want to touch very briefly on atheism
[02:39:13.440 --> 02:39:17.200]  i view atheism as uh an intellectually barren
[02:39:17.200 --> 02:39:20.640]  philosophy whose current champions i'm talking about people like christopher
[02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:24.160]  kitchen sam harris uh richard dawkins these guys
[02:39:24.160 --> 02:39:28.560]  simply cannot find a non sequitur that they don't like it just one silly
[02:39:28.560 --> 02:39:32.880]  non sequitur after another well for me atheists are basically
[02:39:32.880 --> 02:39:36.160]  saying we know everything and it's almost a religion that there's nothing
[02:39:36.160 --> 02:39:39.040]  i mean how do they know out of hundreds of billions of galaxies
[02:39:39.040 --> 02:39:42.400]  that there aren't entities and civilizations that are
[02:39:42.400 --> 02:39:47.600]  beyond anything we could even imagine god uh you know uh having i mean to state
[02:39:47.600 --> 02:39:50.880]  that it's basically saying they know everything oh i know that
[02:39:50.880 --> 02:39:55.280]  uh i don't know where no one knows whether or not god or exist or not but
[02:39:55.280 --> 02:39:59.120]  if he doesn't i do not believe that atheistic dogma
[02:39:59.120 --> 02:40:02.720]  leaves one here's what i'm saying vince and a lot of people have had
[02:40:02.720 --> 02:40:08.480]  prescient events psychic events uh you know knowing that grandma just died
[02:40:08.480 --> 02:40:11.360]  calling him though she wasn't sick yeah grandma just died how'd you know that
[02:40:11.360 --> 02:40:14.240]  i mean i've had things like that happen i think i'm not even gonna get into it
[02:40:14.240 --> 02:40:17.120]  it's ridiculous i was fishing i mean i'm gonna go ahead and tell the story
[02:40:17.120 --> 02:40:20.160]  yeah i know six a.m. driving out with a guide
[02:40:20.160 --> 02:40:24.000]  i've been out there many times port aransas never run over a dolphin
[02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:27.520]  uh never hurt anybody running over a dolphin the dolphins are super smart
[02:40:27.520 --> 02:40:30.080]  and i have this super strong feeling we're gonna run over a dolphin three
[02:40:30.080 --> 02:40:33.280]  minutes later we run over a dolphin yeah now come on there's stuff going on we
[02:40:33.280 --> 02:40:35.840]  don't know about yeah i agree with you i agree with you but that doesn't mean
[02:40:35.840 --> 02:40:39.200]  that there's a god who created the universe because of that but there are
[02:40:39.200 --> 02:40:42.640]  paranormal things going on i don't reject it listen i'm an agnostic
[02:40:42.640 --> 02:40:45.920]  now let me explain to you now because i think your your your audience should
[02:40:45.920 --> 02:40:48.880]  know this see us of course believe in god right
[02:40:48.880 --> 02:40:52.560]  atheists do not believe in god an agnostic says i don't know
[02:40:52.560 --> 02:40:55.600]  perhaps a better definition of agnostic is someone who believes that the
[02:40:55.600 --> 02:41:00.080]  existence vis-a-vis non-existence of god is unknowable of course if it's unknowable
[02:41:00.080 --> 02:41:03.920]  you can't know now i like to point out that there's a rather bright guy on my
[02:41:03.920 --> 02:41:07.200]  side at least people tend to think he's bright his name is einstein
[02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:11.520]  einstein was agnostic interestingly enough darwin turns out to be an
[02:41:11.520 --> 02:41:15.040]  agnostic i say interestingly enough uh elix because
[02:41:15.040 --> 02:41:20.080]  most evolutionists are are atheists and yet the founder of evolution darwin
[02:41:20.080 --> 02:41:25.760]  turns out to be an agnostic my view on the existence of god it's an impenetrable
[02:41:25.760 --> 02:41:30.160]  mystery it's beyond human comprehension as einstein said the
[02:41:30.160 --> 02:41:34.800]  problem is too vast for our limited minds and i think the most
[02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:38.000]  responsible position to take on this issue on the eternal
[02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:42.080]  he also said god would not play dice he said god would not play dice with
[02:41:42.080 --> 02:41:46.880]  reality yes okay very sharp very sharp i'm against the
[02:41:46.880 --> 02:41:51.360]  tough across examiner he said many things throughout his life
[02:41:51.360 --> 02:41:55.680]  no one's been quoted more on on on god than einstein many things during his
[02:41:55.680 --> 02:42:00.960]  life that gave fodder to theist atheists and agnostic see he's one of our own
[02:42:00.960 --> 02:42:04.720]  and that's one of them right there god does not play dice with the universe
[02:42:04.720 --> 02:42:08.560]  the inference being okay he believes in god but the only time i ever found where
[02:42:08.560 --> 02:42:13.280]  he used one of these appellations uh was in a letter i think was october
[02:42:13.280 --> 02:42:17.440]  25th 1950 five years before he died to an m burkowitz
[02:42:17.440 --> 02:42:21.440]  set the christian archives where he said on the
[02:42:21.440 --> 02:42:25.920]  matter of god i am an agnostic that's the only time that i ever heard him use
[02:42:25.920 --> 02:42:28.480]  one of these words but that's very good you interjected something there about
[02:42:28.480 --> 02:42:33.840]  very important uh i love the uh non-literary articulation of
[02:42:33.840 --> 02:42:38.560]  agnosticism by gertrude stein you know who she is she said there ain't no answer
[02:42:38.560 --> 02:42:42.080]  there ain't going to be any answer there never has been an answer that's the
[02:42:42.080 --> 02:42:45.360]  answer uh the great criminal lawyer of years
[02:42:45.360 --> 02:42:48.240]  ago clarence sterrell said i don't purport to know
[02:42:48.240 --> 02:42:51.760]  what ignorant men are sure of now there's many other things we can talk about
[02:42:51.760 --> 02:42:55.760]  the day uh i don't believe that christian god can possibly exist he's a
[02:42:55.760 --> 02:43:00.160]  contradiction in terms you can't be all good and all powerful at the same time
[02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:04.080]  because christ christ said that this is parables
[02:43:04.080 --> 02:43:07.440]  the profane aren't going to understand this
[02:43:07.440 --> 02:43:10.560]  and i read the bible it makes perfect sense those contradictions
[02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:15.280]  are subtleties in the context of the area they're being discussed and then it
[02:43:15.280 --> 02:43:19.280]  all later integrates together i i i yeah well i i discuss the i take the
[02:43:19.280 --> 02:43:23.200]  lilies of the field let me come i discuss all of that but but christianity
[02:43:23.200 --> 02:43:26.720]  and judaism believe that god is all powerful and all good he can be one of
[02:43:26.720 --> 02:43:30.160]  the other he can't be both uh for example if you're all powerful uh that
[02:43:30.160 --> 02:43:33.200]  means you can prevent evil if you can prevent evil you don't allow the
[02:43:33.200 --> 02:43:37.680]  the holocaust but god refuses to create robots it's free will
[02:43:37.680 --> 02:43:40.640]  well so i just told you wait a while i wait a while the globalists say i don't
[02:43:40.640 --> 02:43:43.120]  have free will because then they want to tell me what to do
[02:43:43.120 --> 02:43:46.480]  because they've got their will they want me rudderless look i got free will i
[02:43:46.480 --> 02:43:50.400]  know i do okay uh i don't know if there's free will
[02:43:50.400 --> 02:43:54.240]  doc let's let's assume even though i told you that the bible says it over
[02:43:54.240 --> 02:43:57.360]  let's assume that there is free will and you hear what christian say
[02:43:57.360 --> 02:44:01.600]  you're all given free will god's not responsible for all for all you exercise
[02:44:01.600 --> 02:44:04.960]  you've heard that many many times okay well there are the calvinists who say
[02:44:04.960 --> 02:44:08.320]  that we don't have free will that's exactly right and what a what a horrible
[02:44:08.320 --> 02:44:12.880]  idea i'm a slave and and then and then and then and then god
[02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:17.120]  shows some to be evil some to be good this is all a test well martin martin
[02:44:17.120 --> 02:44:20.800]  loser the founder of Protestantism here's what he says he says quote god for
[02:44:20.800 --> 02:44:24.640]  nose and wills all things he perceives and tends and does all
[02:44:24.640 --> 02:44:27.440]  things according to his own eternal and fallible will
[02:44:27.440 --> 02:44:32.000]  he says quote this knocks free will flat i'm not saying the loser is right but
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:36.560]  he's the guy that founded Protestantism he says this knocks free will flat and
[02:44:36.560 --> 02:44:42.160]  utterly shatters it uh he says that man's will is free only to the
[02:44:42.160 --> 02:44:47.120]  extent of doing quote the will of god that man can do no good except through
[02:44:47.120 --> 02:44:50.800]  god look i already know what my gut is experiencing creation but i want to get
[02:44:50.800 --> 02:44:55.040]  to have free will but also there's providence god does
[02:44:55.040 --> 02:44:58.560]  move through individuals if they're willing that's the free will to turn
[02:44:58.560 --> 02:45:01.520]  yourself over as a vessel then there's those that have given themselves over
[02:45:01.520 --> 02:45:05.440]  to evil then god will also use them it's more complex than that okay i know
[02:45:05.440 --> 02:45:08.400]  that but i i get into the complexity and the divinity of doubt but i want to
[02:45:08.400 --> 02:45:11.200]  ask you a question i got a tough question for you because okay it's a very good
[02:45:11.200 --> 02:45:15.760]  question uh the christians say god gives you all free
[02:45:15.760 --> 02:45:19.600]  will and therefore he's not responsible with that okay i don't buy into that
[02:45:19.600 --> 02:45:23.440]  uh number one he's also omniscient so he knew what the monsters of history were
[02:45:23.440 --> 02:45:26.480]  going to do before they did it number two he's supposed to be all powerful he
[02:45:26.480 --> 02:45:29.760]  knew they were going to do it he didn't step in okay he did not prevent all
[02:45:29.760 --> 02:45:33.440]  because the soul's immortal it's a test i haven't asked you my question yet all right
[02:45:33.440 --> 02:45:36.560]  uh so that's their argument that he's not responsible
[02:45:36.560 --> 02:45:39.760]  uh let's take a hypothetical alex you have parents
[02:45:39.760 --> 02:45:44.160]  and they have a son to call him eddie 17 years old and he's robbing raping and
[02:45:44.160 --> 02:45:48.480]  murdering uh everyone in his area of town uh the police don't know about it but
[02:45:48.480 --> 02:45:52.080]  the parents do and uh they have the power to stop them but they say you know
[02:45:52.080 --> 02:45:56.400]  eddie's got free will and i'm not responsible for how he exercises so i'm
[02:45:56.400 --> 02:45:59.680]  not going to try to stop him what would you think of those parents uh they
[02:45:59.680 --> 02:46:04.240]  would be satanist okay well why if god does the same identical thing
[02:46:04.240 --> 02:46:09.040]  why do you have uh a supposedly good view of him that he gives us free will he's
[02:46:09.040 --> 02:46:12.480]  not responsible how do you how do you reconcile
[02:46:12.480 --> 02:46:18.240]  because by the very nature of creation it is the individual decision to do good
[02:46:18.240 --> 02:46:24.080]  or evil that is set in motion and so of course god knows the final outcome
[02:46:24.080 --> 02:46:27.840]  but it is something that has to be played out because that's the nature
[02:46:27.840 --> 02:46:32.800]  of the spacetime continuum uh dimensional overlay is that it must be free
[02:46:32.800 --> 02:46:36.560]  well if you were on the witness stand uh after a half hour i think you'd have to
[02:46:36.560 --> 02:46:40.000]  back down from this because there's nothing no there's nothing solid
[02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:44.320]  and what you said someone did say well god is supernatural oh well you just said
[02:46:44.320 --> 02:46:47.760]  that's like declaring the moon declaratively is made of cheese
[02:46:47.760 --> 02:46:51.440]  uh i mean that might fool you know somebody uh who's got a low IQ on the
[02:46:51.440 --> 02:46:54.880]  on one of the jurors but come on i said something pretty heavy there
[02:46:54.880 --> 02:46:58.720]  okay but factually uh it doesn't make any difference whether it's god
[02:46:58.720 --> 02:47:03.680]  or the here's the difference mr billy oh see i've had experiences i won't even
[02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:07.760]  share on air okay let me tell you this stuff is not vapers or hallucinations
[02:47:07.760 --> 02:47:10.960]  the experiences of out of my life that are mine and i'm and they're personal
[02:47:10.960 --> 02:47:14.400]  let me tell you there's a lot going on in heaven and earth that aren't in all
[02:47:14.400 --> 02:47:18.240]  your books i agree on that i agree and i don't reject it i i'm an agnostic i
[02:47:18.240 --> 02:47:21.120]  don't reject what you're saying there's a lot of paranormal things going on
[02:47:21.120 --> 02:47:23.920]  that doesn't necessarily mean however that there's a god who created the
[02:47:23.920 --> 02:47:27.200]  universe okay that doesn't really mean that but there are strange things going
[02:47:27.200 --> 02:47:31.040]  on a a twin is uh is brutalized by some thugs
[02:47:31.040 --> 02:47:34.640]  and uh his twin across the country feels the pain at the same time
[02:47:34.640 --> 02:47:38.960]  oh it's all real it's all real we only see a tiny fraction of reality
[02:47:38.960 --> 02:47:43.120]  but that doesn't translate necessarily to a god who created the universe
[02:47:43.120 --> 02:47:46.720]  well okay let me ask you this question i always had a dream a recurring dream
[02:47:46.720 --> 02:47:49.840]  till i was about 12 i had it almost every week
[02:47:49.840 --> 02:47:53.040]  where i would go to the very edge of the universe and had it from the time of it
[02:47:53.040 --> 02:47:58.160]  like a baby first memories till i was 12 or 13 then i stopped having it very
[02:47:58.160 --> 02:48:01.360]  intense studying it you know scientifically you
[02:48:01.360 --> 02:48:05.200]  say it was a low oxygen dream something like that can manifest this but
[02:48:05.200 --> 02:48:08.960]  it would be the great question of what happens at the end of the universe
[02:48:08.960 --> 02:48:13.440]  what created matter to begin with okay big bang what was before that
[02:48:13.440 --> 02:48:17.360]  and and and then you have to ask what is this dimensional creation
[02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:20.800]  and then at the end of the dream i was just gasping for air
[02:48:20.800 --> 02:48:25.440]  uh in the incredible presence of uh something so
[02:48:25.440 --> 02:48:29.520]  indescribable that it it it simply
[02:48:29.520 --> 02:48:32.880]  envisioned creation i mean i mean come on
[02:48:32.880 --> 02:48:36.480]  vince what what made all this then i mean where does it in where did it come
[02:48:36.480 --> 02:48:40.000]  from i don't know feel can't you feel it don't you
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:43.280]  feel it that's why i said i'm an agnostic that's why
[02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:47.840]  einstein and darwin were agnostic talking about going all the way back i want
[02:48:47.840 --> 02:48:51.040]  to give you a good argument that sees them those that believe in god
[02:48:51.040 --> 02:48:54.800]  have come up with and you probably well i'm sure you know about it goes back to
[02:48:54.800 --> 02:48:57.600]  the 13th century thomas Aquinas yes umma
[02:48:57.600 --> 02:49:01.360]  theologica uh first cause first cause means that
[02:49:01.360 --> 02:49:04.960]  everything existence whether it's a peach on a tree uh a car
[02:49:04.960 --> 02:49:09.360]  a shoe was caused by something else and that in turn was caused by something
[02:49:09.360 --> 02:49:11.920]  else i'm going to get into the big bang in a moment here now
[02:49:11.920 --> 02:49:15.840]  uh but this regression in the chain of causation it's believed
[02:49:15.840 --> 02:49:19.680]  cannot go back into infinity it has to go back to something
[02:49:19.680 --> 02:49:23.600]  which was not caused by anything else which was independent Aquinas called it
[02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:28.000]  the first cause the uncaused cause uh uh uh if you will
[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:32.000]  uh and that uncaused cause that first cause theists believe
[02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:35.600]  is god now how do the atheists and the scientists get around it when they come
[02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:41.120]  up with the big bang theory which holds that at some point in time about 13.9
[02:49:41.120 --> 02:49:46.480]  13.7 billion years ago the universe exploded into existence in a
[02:49:46.480 --> 02:49:49.680]  billionth of a second from some subatomic
[02:49:49.680 --> 02:49:53.520]  particle now apart from the fact that on its face it doesn't seem to make sense
[02:49:53.520 --> 02:49:56.560]  that the universe could explode into existence from something much much
[02:49:56.560 --> 02:50:00.400]  smaller than the point of a needle let's give the the uh the physicists
[02:50:00.400 --> 02:50:03.600]  their due we don't understand these things but there's also i think a very
[02:50:03.600 --> 02:50:07.680]  enormous defect with that reasoning no matter how small
[02:50:07.680 --> 02:50:10.960]  that subatomic particle was no matter how small it was
[02:50:10.960 --> 02:50:14.720]  it was something and let me repeat it was something and the question is and i
[02:50:14.720 --> 02:50:17.040]  went over to caltech read the books on it
[02:50:17.040 --> 02:50:20.080]  the the the office don't address themselves the question which is an
[02:50:20.080 --> 02:50:23.920]  automatic question who put that something there they don't ask that
[02:50:23.920 --> 02:50:28.080]  question you follow and what made that something that's right i agree i agree
[02:50:28.080 --> 02:50:32.240]  but are we going back to a first cause as Aquinas says and that first cause of
[02:50:32.240 --> 02:50:34.320]  thought i don't know i'm not saying that first
[02:50:34.320 --> 02:50:37.920]  cause is dispositive of the issue but it's a very difficult logical argument
[02:50:37.920 --> 02:50:42.320]  to get around well look the point is we don't know
[02:50:42.320 --> 02:50:47.840]  what's going on i can feel the presence of the energy source that creates all
[02:50:47.840 --> 02:50:52.640]  life in the universe and uh i just feel so sorry for these
[02:50:52.640 --> 02:50:57.040]  atheists because they are they they've like put the blinders on
[02:50:57.040 --> 02:51:01.040]  you've got to be open to it to experience it we'll be right back

[02:54:09.200 --> 02:54:12.080]  well i want to be clear i have a personal relationship
[02:54:12.080 --> 02:54:18.080]  with jesus christ and i am a christian and people can analyze it all day and
[02:54:18.080 --> 02:54:22.000]  you know say that a christian god's impossible and fine contradictions
[02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:26.080]  uh you know it's all a intellectual uh but at the same time personal and
[02:54:26.080 --> 02:54:30.000]  spiritual experience and it's also um you know
[02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:33.440]  one person reads poetry and sees ugly poetry someone else sees something
[02:54:33.440 --> 02:54:35.680]  beautiful but that's why i wanted to get vince at
[02:54:35.680 --> 02:54:39.360]  boogly ocean today because i think that by talking to him in this big book he's
[02:54:39.360 --> 02:54:43.040]  got out right now uh that it gets people to you know really
[02:54:43.040 --> 02:54:46.640]  think about the nature of the world i just wonder why world leaders are trying
[02:54:46.640 --> 02:54:51.040]  to build a ten union nation global government and trying to bring in
[02:54:51.040 --> 02:54:55.440]  this cashless society to track us i i i guess you would say vince at
[02:54:55.440 --> 02:54:58.160]  all this big brother stuff that's just basically people
[02:54:58.160 --> 02:55:01.200]  taking the bible and using it as a blueprint or revelations
[02:55:01.200 --> 02:55:04.320]  no no i don't know why they're doing that i'd have to study it i'd have to
[02:55:04.320 --> 02:55:07.520]  study okay so what's your view on the big bang then where did it all come
[02:55:07.520 --> 02:55:10.880]  from keyboard elves uh what what i just told you
[02:55:10.880 --> 02:55:13.920]  right now is that the big pain big bang may not be
[02:55:13.920 --> 02:55:18.640]  valid that may be god who created the universe i gave you an argument for god
[02:55:18.640 --> 02:55:23.600]  uh the atheists have yet to come up in my opinion with one persuasive argument
[02:55:23.600 --> 02:55:27.440]  for god all they come up with is nonsense non sequiturs i'll give you a
[02:55:27.440 --> 02:55:31.840]  couple there but non sequiturs if god existed they say why do we have all
[02:55:31.840 --> 02:55:35.600]  the horror and evil in the world but that presupposes that god has to be all
[02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:39.520]  good which is an obvious non sequitur he obviously can be all powerful without
[02:55:39.520 --> 02:55:41.680]  also being all good i'll give you another one
[02:55:41.680 --> 02:55:45.040]  another non sequitur atheists do not believe that god created man you know
[02:55:45.040 --> 02:55:48.320]  they believe that man evolved from some original life form you know
[02:55:48.320 --> 02:55:51.120]  a bacteria somehow evolved into Mozart
[02:55:51.120 --> 02:55:56.080]  but that presupposes that god did not create this original life form and
[02:55:56.080 --> 02:56:00.480]  evolution took over from there their biggest non sequitur out now
[02:56:00.480 --> 02:56:04.560]  christopher hitchens and uh sam harris they're the big proponents of this
[02:56:04.560 --> 02:56:08.320]  they feel that if they can slay the dragon of organized religion and
[02:56:08.320 --> 02:56:11.280]  unworthy opponent they have therefore slain god
[02:56:11.280 --> 02:56:15.680]  but this presupposes alex that you cannot have god without religion which is
[02:56:15.680 --> 02:56:19.520]  too ridiculous to even comment upon a two thousand and ten
[02:56:19.520 --> 02:56:24.240]  two national poll showed that over thirty percent of americans who do not
[02:56:24.240 --> 02:56:28.320]  belong to any organized religion still believe very strongly in god
[02:56:28.320 --> 02:56:31.520]  the antithesis of god is no god not no
[02:56:31.520 --> 02:56:36.080]  uh... religion but these atheists come up with one non sequitur after another
[02:56:36.080 --> 02:56:39.680]  they're in uh... they're almost vapid uh pheasants got
[02:56:39.680 --> 02:56:43.600]  that powerful powerful argument the first cause it's very difficult to get
[02:56:43.600 --> 02:56:46.480]  around are you there
[02:56:46.480 --> 02:56:49.200]  no i'm just listening to what you're saying okay
[02:56:49.200 --> 02:56:52.800]  uh i do want to say this for your audience and i'm not bragging
[02:56:52.800 --> 02:56:57.520]  okay just have to be a fact i've written a definitive book on the three biggest
[02:56:57.520 --> 02:57:01.520]  uh murder cases the last half century the manson case the simpson case and the
[02:57:01.520 --> 02:57:04.480]  kennedy assassination now how am i able to do this
[02:57:04.480 --> 02:57:09.600]  because my only master alex i have no other master is the evidence i look for
[02:57:09.600 --> 02:57:13.280]  the evidence that i evaluated and i draw inference uh from it
[02:57:13.280 --> 02:57:17.520]  just last month at the invitation of the pentagon i gave a three-hour lecture
[02:57:17.520 --> 02:57:21.120]  uh to marine prosecutors down a camp camp penalty
[02:57:21.120 --> 02:57:24.800]  everything i say in this book divinity of doubt i support you may not agree with
[02:57:24.800 --> 02:57:27.680]  the support but i get a lot of support for everything that i say and i want
[02:57:27.680 --> 02:57:30.080]  your audience to know that about me
[02:57:30.080 --> 02:57:34.000]  no i i i believe that you believe what you're saying and only someone being
[02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:37.280]  honest to come to the fact that you don't know either way
[02:57:37.280 --> 02:57:41.920]  uh and i respect that you know the the atheist i find to be their own cult
[02:57:41.920 --> 02:57:45.040]  uh and at the same time i don't know if evolution's real
[02:57:45.040 --> 02:57:48.080]  or or whatever i just know i believe in god
[02:57:48.080 --> 02:57:51.440]  that's a fake debate in the last 150 years that christians
[02:57:51.440 --> 02:57:56.480]  were drawn into uh where they then get into debates with scientists as a plan
[02:57:56.480 --> 02:57:59.200]  to discredit them who am i to say how god
[02:57:59.200 --> 02:58:06.080]  designed things or you know what went on uh and uh you know all these things
[02:58:06.080 --> 02:58:10.080]  saying the earth six thousand years old and they're carbon dating you know
[02:58:10.080 --> 02:58:14.240]  million-year-old human bones i just i just see it playing into a trap and i
[02:58:14.240 --> 02:58:19.200]  see the system attacking christianity because it's not compatible with this
[02:58:19.200 --> 02:58:24.560]  corrupt stinking humanistic world government eugenics system it's
[02:58:24.560 --> 02:58:27.200]  actually anti-human we're back in one minute with vincent
[02:58:27.200 --> 02:58:29.760]  bugliosi and i thought we'd have him on for some
[02:58:29.760 --> 02:58:33.600]  debate so we're not just here uh you know agreeing with each other i think
[02:58:33.600 --> 02:58:37.440]  it's very thought-provoking back in one minute i'm alex jones we got a new

[02:59:58.240 --> 03:00:06.880]  network network
[03:00:06.880 --> 03:00:15.440]  oh cinnamon where you gonna run to cinnamon where you gonna run to

[03:00:25.440 --> 03:00:28.480]  all right final segment with vince at boogalio see
[03:00:28.480 --> 03:00:31.840]  and i got him on on a host of issues but what he's out currently promoting is
[03:00:31.840 --> 03:00:34.240]  his a new book he says he thinks this is most important
[03:00:34.240 --> 03:00:39.280]  the divinity of doubt the god question what's your view on prayer
[03:00:39.280 --> 03:00:44.640]  well my view on prayer alex is that except now and then in a placebo sense
[03:00:44.640 --> 03:00:49.120]  uh they're completely useless prayers that two working hands can achieve far
[03:00:49.120 --> 03:00:52.240]  more than a hundred million coupled ones i wrote an entire chapter on it let me
[03:00:52.240 --> 03:00:56.000]  try to briefly summarize it if people pray for something let's say a
[03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:58.880]  promotion or whatever it is and they get what they pray for causing them to
[03:00:58.880 --> 03:01:02.240]  believe that quote dot answered my prayers you've heard people say that
[03:01:02.240 --> 03:01:06.080]  shouldn't they then say to themselves alex if god answered my prayers
[03:01:06.080 --> 03:01:09.360]  this automatically means that god has the power that's the
[03:01:09.360 --> 03:01:13.360]  keyword the power to answer prayers and if he has the power
[03:01:13.360 --> 03:01:16.720]  how can i possibly say god is all good when i know
[03:01:16.720 --> 03:01:20.880]  absolutely no no question of no to a hundred percent certainty
[03:01:20.880 --> 03:01:24.480]  that he if there's a god up there who has the power to answer prayers he nearly
[03:01:24.480 --> 03:01:29.040]  always turns down the praying party when that party needs him the most like the
[03:01:29.040 --> 03:01:32.640]  six million jews who most likely prayed to him during the holocaust
[03:01:32.640 --> 03:01:36.640]  like the incredible 25 million people who have already died worldwide from AIDS
[03:01:36.640 --> 03:01:41.920]  the millions from genocide starvation the fact that we know god turned these
[03:01:41.920 --> 03:01:46.000]  millions of people down telling them in effect get lost take a walk
[03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:50.080]  should tell us that god not only is not all good but he doesn't answer prayers
[03:01:50.080 --> 03:01:54.160]  and if we happen to get what we prayed for alex it had nothing to do with god
[03:01:54.160 --> 03:01:57.440]  look if god answers prayers alex and he's all good
[03:01:57.440 --> 03:02:00.400]  why doesn't he ever answer the prayers for peace there have been literally
[03:02:00.400 --> 03:02:04.240]  billions upon billions of prayers for peace down through the years
[03:02:04.240 --> 03:02:09.360]  he had groups and factions here's the issue look look here's the issue well i
[03:02:09.360 --> 03:02:12.960]  just want to say they persist and warn viciously with each other the
[03:02:12.960 --> 03:02:17.760]  evidence continuing unabated alex now one one wouldn't one think alex and then
[03:02:17.760 --> 03:02:21.040]  then you can get to your own thing wouldn't one think that people would
[03:02:21.040 --> 03:02:24.080]  finally come to the realization that either there's no one up there listening
[03:02:24.080 --> 03:02:27.040]  to their prayers for peace or if there is he you know he doesn't have the power
[03:02:27.040 --> 03:02:30.480]  to stop the violence or if he does he has no desire to do so
[03:02:30.480 --> 03:02:34.320]  why don't they come to that realization that praying to him is like praying
[03:02:34.320 --> 03:02:38.640]  to a tree trunk you answer that vincent the omblo
[03:02:38.640 --> 03:02:43.440]  boogliosi is our guest i'm just joking and obviously if you don't believe you
[03:02:43.440 --> 03:02:46.720]  don't know if god exists you don't know the devil exists uh
[03:02:46.720 --> 03:02:50.720]  then so i don't know god may exist and maybe the devil does too i don't know
[03:02:50.720 --> 03:02:53.520]  these things uh but let me say something else
[03:02:53.520 --> 03:02:56.400]  and and and this is gonna be a tough one for you but you're very very bright
[03:02:56.400 --> 03:02:58.960]  you're very sharp but this is gonna be a tough one
[03:02:58.960 --> 03:03:03.200]  all theologians agree that god either caused or allowed
[03:03:03.200 --> 03:03:05.840]  everything to happen that's not in question if they don't agree to that
[03:03:05.840 --> 03:03:09.680]  then he's not omnipotent uh hope john paul second
[03:03:09.680 --> 03:03:13.680]  it is we're almost out of time okay said that god
[03:03:13.680 --> 03:03:17.120]  allowed the holocaust to take place now here's my question
[03:03:17.120 --> 03:03:20.880]  whenever there's a catastrophe like 9 11 for instance millions immediately run
[03:03:20.880 --> 03:03:24.320]  to their church simon synagogue other place of worship to pray for the
[03:03:24.320 --> 03:03:28.800]  victims and their loved ones to the very entity who caused or
[03:03:28.800 --> 03:03:32.320]  allowed the horror to take no we've already been over this god gives us
[03:03:32.320 --> 03:03:36.640]  free will and and you know there's no doubt
[03:03:36.640 --> 03:03:41.120]  that there is providence and uh a miraculous things have been documented
[03:03:41.120 --> 03:03:45.600]  over and over again but if it's part of god's larger plan
[03:03:45.600 --> 03:03:49.760]  so you know it's like the country song some of uh
[03:03:49.760 --> 03:03:53.600]  you know god's greatest gifts were unanswered prayers who is that
[03:03:53.600 --> 03:03:56.640]  garth brooks i forget the exact name of the song
[03:03:56.640 --> 03:03:59.920]  there's so many things that we've prayed for that it turns out later in the
[03:03:59.920 --> 03:04:03.360]  larger plan and you can say well that gets rid of free will
[03:04:03.360 --> 03:04:09.920]  i mean it's basically a larger plan but with free will it's a combination of
[03:04:09.920 --> 03:04:14.080]  all those things put together just like the universe is it's a very complex
[03:04:14.080 --> 03:04:17.040]  very complex situation but we know there's a lot of things going on
[03:04:17.040 --> 03:04:20.320]  i agree with you 100 a lot of things going on but how do you pray to the very
[03:04:20.320 --> 03:04:24.240]  entity that caused or allowed at least the horror to take place how do you do
[03:04:24.240 --> 03:04:28.480]  that you know what god god doesn't you know
[03:04:28.480 --> 03:04:31.120]  didn't make charlie manson go out and cut the baby
[03:04:31.120 --> 03:04:33.600]  or have his minions cut the baby out of share and take
[03:04:33.600 --> 03:04:36.640]  no but he knew it was going to happen before it happened and he didn't stop it
[03:04:36.640 --> 03:04:39.840]  alec he did not say he knew it was going to happen he had the power to stop it
[03:04:39.840 --> 03:04:43.120]  and and and he did not do so and i'll guarantee you that the people that
[03:04:43.120 --> 03:04:46.880]  happened to you made decisions in their life and things that went on
[03:04:46.880 --> 03:04:51.040]  that again overall with the sum total
[03:04:51.040 --> 03:04:55.120]  basically it's it's it's what we all do in life then affects each other
[03:04:55.120 --> 03:04:59.280]  hey vencent amazing discussion and i look forward to speaking to you so i'll
[03:04:59.280 --> 03:05:10.800]  get you back on about the mansons i appreciate it
